-In September of 1864, a group of representatives from the colonies of British North America arrived on a steam ship in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, to discuss a groundbreaking idea. Their goal -- to unite the Maritime Union with the then-named province of Canada. Unfortunately for the men, a circus was in town at the same time, which the public found much more interesting. So there was no one working at the docks, and the men's ship remained at sea. Humiliated, the only official agreement to come from this meeting was that the men would meet again. Another gathering with the same agenda was held the next month in Québec. After lengthy negotiations, the men agreed to create a single united country, Canada, and drafted the British North America act, later known as Canada's Constitution. With winter keeping any more distracting carnivals at bay, people across the land cheered over the creation of their new country, which didn't officially become a country until three years later on July 1, 1867, Canada Day, when a bored Queen Victoria accidentally noticed the Constitution on an end table and reluctantly signed it into law. The world's indifference towards my homeland had officially begun. I was born a typical Canadian child -- raised by a lumberjack, had hockey bed sheets, and went to school with an Inuit boy named Peter Poontip, who was, ironically, the last guy in class to remain a virgin. I love living in Canada, specifically, beautiful Calgary, Alberta. With the Rockies on one side, prairies and rivers on the other, I thought it was paradise. I was also an adventurous child. Like one winter when I was 4, I thought I could jump a huge rock on a hill on a toboggan. I could not. Or when I was in grade eight, I wanted to make a bomb like the ones I saw in action movies and ended up blowing up my junior high school long jump pit and my almost my chances of being allowed into grade nine. A teacher there, Mr. Macklemore, told me that I'd never amount to anything and the next time I came back to the school would be as its janitor. More on him later. 10 years later, I had moved to L.A. and landed a job as a TV sitcom writer. I was fortunate enough to work on some great shows, some so-so shows, and &quot;According to Jim.&quot; But on every show I worked on, I kept running into the same strange problem -- once my fellow writers found out I was Canadian, they'd immediately stare at me like I was a freak and make some lame, stereotypical comments about my homeland. -So, I hear you're from Canada. -Yeah. -[ Heavy Canadian accent ] How's it goin', eh? [ Chuckles ] No doubt about it! [ Laughs ] -This annoying issue also continued wherever I traveled. In Kenya, these guys wondered how I was so healthy given Canada couldn't grow vegetables under our permanent layer of ice. The Italian man who snapped this worried the sun would melt me because Canadians are all nice snow people. Then one day, I snapped. Decades of people's lame stereotypes or complete ignorance about my homeland had finally pushed me over the edge. Come on. Who out there really knows anything about Canada? Anyone? Exactly. So I decided to make a movie about it -- a home movie about my home. I would interview a wide variety of Canadians, some more known than others, as well as a variety of non-Canadians from around the world while driving from one end of Canada to the other. This seemed to be the only way to get the answers to the long list of questions that have plagued me my whole life and show once and for all, we're more than just igloos and beer. But could I finally put my eternal problem to rest? There was only one way to find out. [ Adventurous music plays ] I'm here in the Maritimes. Today is Saturday, June 22nd. I'm about to begin my journey to go from coast to coast in Canada, and I'm gonna find out what it means being Canadian before midnight July 1st -- Canada Day -- in Vancouver. Hit it, DJ Brad and the Queensland Dancers. [ Scottish music plays ] As this charming, old-time welcome continued around me and continued some more, I consulted my map on how best to begin my cross-country drive. Wow, these guys really love dancing. And they were starting to make me a little dizzy, so I decided to just head west. And I was gonna do that in one very sexy ride. -A beautiful 2012 Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan. With room for eight and doors wide enough to easily handle big stickers promoting small movies, the Town &amp; Country is perfect for all your cross-Canada documentary needs. -What's up, ladies? -Retail price is $31,999. Back to you, Rob. [ Cheers and applause ] -Thanks, Helen. So, as my journey began, I realized I had a huge task ahead of me, given how big Canada was, but couldn't be starting from a more amazing place -- Nova Scotia. Originally populated by Mi'kmaq people and on Canada's east coast, Nova Scotia is famous for its seafood, its rugged beauty, and the iconic lighthouse at Peggys Cove. Since I knew I was gonna be on the road for a while, I thought I'd stretch my legs and get in some fresh salt air and begin finding out what it really means to be Canadian by confirming the issue that got this whole movie rolling in the first place. What is the capital of Canada? -Québec? -How about -- let's guess...Arkansas. -[ Laughs ] -Canada's like an old lady -- it's quite nice to you, it's polite, but you don't really notice it. -I do think about Canada. When it's really hot in Bangladesh, I think of Canada. -Oh, Canadians are easy. It's Bob and Doug McKenzie, it's lots of snow, it's plaid, it's hockey. -What do you guys think the population of Canada is? -Hmm. 4,000. -I say the same. That's a good estimate. -It's huge. -It is. -It's giant. -Gigantic. -It's this giant piece of white chocolate that sits on top of America. -What if I told you it was a little higher? -Really? 6,000. -Okay, I'd be like 450. -Getting warmer. -8,000. -Bingo. -Whoo! -There's a real sort of macho stride to Canadians. It's sort of like &quot;Check me out, get out of my way, I'll kick your ass.&quot; -I think a Canadian would be very tall, um, have broad shoulders, and be quite hairy. -Look at your whole stance right now. You're sort of like you're gonna deal with me. You're legs are open, it's very sexually provocative. -They are white, they have... they... they look very clean. [ Laughs ] -Pretty depressing, right? But this is exactly the sort of stuff we Canadians have been dealing with since there were Canadians. But I wasn't the only Canuck who has had a lifelong issue with this. So... -The world knows little about Canada. I mean, if you go to some places in the United States, they couldn't even tell you where it is. -I think there's a lot of, um, mystery involved. And thank God you're doing this film. I think they think we're mysterious. They don't know a lot about us. -Just the kind of lack of any knowledge at all about the place that you grew up. -I was a bit surprised when I was just in the states last month and I told someone I was from Canada, and they said, &quot;Where's that?&quot; -We don't make headlines a lot, so they're not reading &quot;Canada&quot; every day in the paper. They're reading about, you know, Afghanistan, they're reading Iran, they're reading England. -If we were next to, you know, Uganda, we'd stick out a little bit more. -I swear to you, people have said, &quot;I love Canada. It's one of my favorite cities.&quot; -We're just understated. -Right. -To the point where nobody cares. [ Laughs ] -We're sort of appreciated in the same way, like, Switzerland is. Supposed to be clean, and they have a good banking system. -&quot;Oh, I've just been to Toronto. It's so clean.&quot; -I mean, they ask you if you know people a lot. -Well, I have friend in Canada. Maybe you know him. -What's scary is I actually do know the people, like, more often than I would like to admit. -People outside of Canada, if they had to describe Canada, like in one word, what do you think they would guess? -Igloos! [ Laughs ] -I had people ask me if I lived in an igloo. -They asked if I lived in an igloo. -&quot;How do you get your news? 'Cause you don't have radio or television out there in your igloos.&quot; -Beavers. Lots of beaver. -Lots of beaver. -[ Laughs ] -There was a woman from Sweden who literally asked me that if she came to Canada, would she see polar bears walking down the street. -It was, I don't know, July 10th, and we had cousins that came up and visited, and they brought, you know, boots and thick coats with them. Really. You couldn't even have tracked that information down, huh? -People think Canada is a frozen tundra 12 months a year. -Do you have trees up there? Do you ever see the sun? Those kind of questions, I go, &quot;F-O, and read a book...please.&quot; [ Laughing ] I do get defensive. -See? I'm not alone in my frustration. And what's the deal with igloo obsession? And just like igloos, it was getting cold out there on the rocks, and I still had a lot of ground to cover. With the country ahead of me, I'll admit I was more excited about my trip than I thought I'd be. And I will also admit I was excited the minivan had a heater. My blood had thinned living in the U.S. But in the spirit of honesty, before I got too far, I needed to cop to something else. I've never been to the Maritimes before doing this movie. -Really? -Nope, never. I've been stupid for not exploring my own country up to this point because I've been all around the world. I just have not been all around Canada, which I'm a little embarrassed about. I felt a bit weird saying this, given how defensive I'd always been about my home. But I was gonna see Canada now and get the answer to my quest. When ever I'm outside of Canada, people usually think I'm American. Then they have the minds blown when they learn I am Canadian. Everyone reacts the same way they would when their teacher sprang a pop quiz on them -- surprised, unprepared, and then wanting to be excused because they feel queasy in the pants. Those reactions really hurt our feelings. We're not trying to trick anybody, but I want to know... -Being Canadian is definitely something I enjoy. -[ Laughs ] -Just because most people don't really understand what a Canadian is, but they know we're different somehow. -No matter how many times I said it and said it in print or said it on &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; everybody I met, and I would say, &quot;Well, you know, I'm a Canadian.&quot; They go, &quot;Really? You're a Canadian?&quot; -People were surprised when I tell them I was Canadian. They seemed kind of betrayed by it. -Suddenly I'll say one word that they'll pick out, and they'll just go, &quot;You're a Canadian!&quot; Like I've been hiding from them. -I was the social conscience of America for nine years, and I think that the fact that I was Canadian was maybe just too confusing for people. -You know, it probably goes back to the McCarthy thing -- they look like us, they talk like us, they move like us, but they're other. -Because it means we walk amongst them. -This club of Canadians that all sort of walk around knowing like... -Winking at each other. -They almost look like Americans, but it was almost like they were Russian spies dressed up as Americans. -Right. -We look like Americans. Sometimes we can change our abouts and our [American accent] abouts. [ Normal voice ] And we can talk like Americans. We can wear the same clothes as Americans. But you don't know we're there. [ Eerie music plays ] -It's weird, right? We're not so spooky. We're really pretty harmless, unless you try to take our doughnuts. Speaking of which, after buying a few dozen for the crew, I drove West towards the capital of Nova Scotia, Halifax. [ Bagpipe music playing ] Halifax is a historic Canadian city. It's also rich in important world history as a critical staging ground for both the Revolutionary War, the American Civil War, and World War II. -Whoo! -Growing up, Canadian kids study all of this in school, as well as learning the history of the rest of the world. But in my experience outside of Canada, the rest of the world didn't seem to return the favor. So as I walked around town, I got to thinking... -♪ Let's talk about Canada, Canada ♪ ♪ it's the greatest country in the world ♪ -if you had to explain Canada's history to someone in two sentences, what would it be? -Unknown. -I didn't know there was Canadian history. I did not know that. -When I was a kid, like, the history books in Canada were published in the United States. -Right. -There were no history books made in Canada, and so we studied American history until Pierre Trudeau became Prime Minister and said, &quot;We should study Canadian history.&quot; -My name is Al, and I'm from outside of Boston, Massachusetts. -I'm Maddie, and I'm from Dallas, Texas. -When you were in school in Boston, how much Canadian history did you learn? -I don't think we've ever done anything on Canada. -I don't think I learned anything about Canada, really. -K through 12, we spent on Canadian history -- could have been less than two or three minutes. -It's the first country ever to have an unarmed evolution into existence. -Yes, yes, we didn't have the balls to have a civil war. -The United States, like France, we had a serious revolution and killed a lot of people, which is very appealing to young people. -We're not a country that's fought to tell our own story in our own way. -It just seemed like it was a business deal made over lunch, you know? -I don't think it's a boring history. I think that we don't know enough about it. -Laura Secord, you know, was very heroic and did all sorts of, you know, mind-boggling things. -Laura Secord is the founding mother of Canada. She made all the chocolates that I ate growing up. And a lot of people had, like, a picture of David Cassidy over their bed, but I had the Laura Secord chocolate chart. -It is a vibrant history. It is an incredibly bizarre history, and it's not presented or taught that way. I think that's also part of why we're so insecure. We don't believe we're fancy. -Canadian history, it's like watching a field or forest die slowly tree by tree. -The key to Canadian history in reverse is Walt Disney. If we had Walt Disney, we would have had Davy Crockett. -What do we have instead? -Uh...and instead, we had Alex Trebek. -[ Laughs ] Okay. [ Bagpipe music plays ] -But I swear Canada does have some exciting things in our past, like... [ Game show music plays ] Louis Riel -- one of fathers of confederation, who was executed for treason. Or Sir John A. Macdonald, our first Prime Minister, who served six terms but was a major drinker and became famous for publicly acting like an idiot -- a tradition that still lives on today. But there is one thing Canada has contributed to history that I'm positive the world knows about. -Canada, we built that arm that sticks out of the top of the Space Shuttle. -Why are we so proud of it? -Because it says &quot;Canada&quot; right on it. -Ah, yes, the Canadarm. It was a huge source of pride for us, and you didn't need a rocket scientist to explain that, did you? But in case you do, we also have one of those. -The purpose of the robotic arm is to move equipment such as this around within the bay during the flight mission. -Oh, you built the arm on the Space Shuttle. Right. -The Canadarm. -Right. Not the actual Shuttle, though. Just the arm. -Right. -The Americans made the huge Turkey dinner, and we brought the little Jell-O with marshmallows in it. -Sure. -Yeah. -And I hate to bring this up, but we do always have this bad boy in our back pocket. -We burnt down the White House, and it felt good. -You know, in the war of 1812, all of the politicians in Washington have left D.C. because they think the battle's gonna take place in some place in Virginia, so Washington's basically empty. Canadians sail down the Potomac. Before they burn down the White House, though, they sit down, and they have the banquet that was prepared for the President because they thought they were gonna win the battle. At the end of the banquet, they British general turns to the chef, the White House chef, and says, &quot;Tell the President the food was excellent, but the service left something to be desired.&quot; -You got to admit, that story is pretty badass. But if you tell it to an American, they'll think you're crazy. But it's true and something I would have to savor in the car because I had a lot more Canada to go. Plus, the weird guy working the cannon at the Fort kept asking me if I wanted to see his band play that night. I did not. So it was goodbye, Nova Scotia and hello, New Brunswick. New Brunswick was another province I had never been to before, and it was stunning. Huge forests, sparsely populated, and home to Picaroons Brewery, where we stopped off for some quick Canadian refreshments. This pit stop was perfect and delicious... from what I can remember. Thankfully, my producer took over driving duties for a bit while I admired the scenery. As the Millennium Minivan Falcon pressed on, I was a bit nervous about exploring the next question on my list. Why? Because growing up, this was the one thing that every generation of Canadians would discuss endlessly. And honestly, I always found it a bit unsettling. Americans didn't do it. Brits don't. The Chinese don't do this. But if you have ever been in a room with a Canuck or, even worse, a bargain rental vehicle with a bunch, this is bound to come up. I, myself, was guilty of it. So I decided to once and for all learn... -That's a good point. I think that's true. 'Cause I'm always saying that. &quot;Oh, that guy's Canadian.&quot; -The more you find out who is Canadian, the more you're like, &quot;Yes! Score.&quot; Like Leslie Nielsen -- yes! To them, he's an American icon, to us, he's one of ours. -Lorne Michaels -- biggest name in television right now. You know, pretty much controls all of NBC. He's from Toronto. -Mary Pickford, you know, America's sweetheart, she was Canadian. Mack Sennett -- he was Canadian. -Well, you like Loverboy? Yeah, that's us. -Fay Wray is from Canada. Louis B. Mayer -- Canadian. The Warner Brothers -- Canadian. -The list -- all of them know the list of who did what in Canada. -I think Canadians, you know, like to kind of pipe up and say, you know, really, &quot;Look who came from our community.&quot; -Right. -And it comes from our insecurity and our low self-esteem. -We want to make sure Americans know that, like, oh, we've had impact on this culture also. -Takes us to go, &quot;No, no, no. That person you like -- yes, he's Canadian, as well. She's Canadian. They are Canadian.&quot; -I mean, it's the same reason that Jews want to point out who's Jewish. -And I'm Jewish and Canadian, and so I'm doing it all the time. -[ Chuckles ] -The word in Yiddish is naches. They have a tremendous amount of naches -- pride in anyone who is Canadian, who succeeds anywhere in the rest of world. -Like, an American will come up to me and say, you know, &quot;I love 'Family Ties'&quot; or &quot;I love 'Back to the Future'&quot; or whatever. A Canadian will always come up and say, &quot;We're Canadian.&quot; -&quot;Hey, we're from Canada.&quot; And I was, &quot;Where you from?&quot; You know, from Esterhazy, &quot;I'm from...&quot; -Winnipeg, you know? It's like, &quot;Oh, yeah, I'm from Bruderheim. We have so much in common.&quot; -Your excitement upon meeting them doubles because they're Canadian. -Good to see you. -Good to see you, brother. -Canadian? -Yes. -Me, too. -It's that connection. Again, it's that thing that we seek each other out. -I don't know why it is important, but it is. -And as a little nerd, no one embodied my participation in this phenomenon better than when I told anyone who would listen that Captain James T. Kirk was Canadian. -Why does that have to wreck it for them? -'Cause they want the best people on their team. -He's one of our national treasures, and ironically, he comes from Canada. -He's also the epitome of how America foists itself into the world. The prime directive of the Federation was you cannot influence the culture of a planet. And every episode ended with Kirk running into the chambers of the President and going, &quot;Your God is a lie! Give us your zenite.&quot; -I think it says more about you than it does about Captain Kirk. -Well, what are you perceiving? -Well, there's a need to say, you know, Captain Kirk is Canadian, and I'm Canadian. You're trying to elevate yourself a little bit. -Right. -Yeah. -What other problems do you notice about me? I would love to document it. -Well, physical appearance, but I would just -- that's another issue. And I would think, you know, we can talk about the whole clothing thing after the interview. -But why don't we get the final word on my childhood obsession from the man himself? If Captain Kirk was Canadian and wanted everybody off the ship, how would he say it in Canadian? -[ Canadian accent ] &quot;Get out! Get out! You...Labrador, Mongol idiots.&quot; -You know what? It doesn't matter what that guy says. I am always gonna think he is the coolest. As for my trip, I was only two days in, and it was dawning on me that some of the silly Canadian stereotypes may have some merit. However, as we stopped for gas in Fredericton, this happened. A woman saw the sign on our van, and when she learned we were driving across the country trying to find out what it means to be Canadian, she insisted she wanted to contribute. -Contribution to your drive. -I appreciate it. She was so sweet. She and her husband even bought us snacks for the road. See you later. That's her husband. But he couldn't go on camera because he was listening to a hockey game on the car radio, of course. I mean, she was so sweet. Everybody there was just so unbelievably nice. -They were so nice. -And they fortunately or unfortunately brought up another question I've been asked my whole life. -The Canadian superhero, I would call, possibly, Mannersman. He's very well-kempt. He's very polite. He'll fly up to a window and then tap on the window before breaking through it. He always has a sweater. -Politeness is one thing that extends to all of Canada. Everybody knows us for apologizing for things. And yeah, it's a stereotype, but it's a true stereotype. -If I knock into the couch, I'll say sorry to the couch. If I hit the wrong key on my keyboard, I'll say, &quot;Oops, sorry.&quot; -I was on vacation recently, and I bumped into a tree, and I apologized to that tree. -Twice I was rear-ended, and I apologized, and they drove off. -We went to the Hudson Bay, and we were in an elevator, and all I did was just move my shoulder a little bit, and someone said, &quot;Sorry.&quot; And then I turned around this way, and another person on my left said, &quot;Sorry.&quot; And my daughters, like, they were amazed. So when we would go in elevators, I said this elevator ride's gonna be a three-sorry elevator ride or a two-sorry elevator ride. -Quick story. -Sure. -I'm in Vancouver. There's a building on fire. Let's go check that out. We pull over. About 60 people have already gathered. Cop walks up to the fireman, says, &quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot; He says, &quot;Well, you can move all those people back to the street.&quot; I thought, &quot;Good luck.&quot; And he said, &quot;All right, folks, I'm just gonna need you all to move back to the street.&quot; And everybody just went... -I'm always impressed when somebody walks in and goes, &quot;I want a steak, and I want this, and I want this.&quot; I'm like, &quot;That guy's such a badass.&quot; [ Laughter ] And upon further reflection, this is one stereotypical Canadian trait that has had positive effects. -When I came to the United States, I was well received, and everywhere I went, people said, &quot;Oh, you're Canadian. You're automatically a nice person.&quot; -When I'm in other parts of the world, when people find out I'm Canadian, they all seem relieved, actually. -Yeah, no, it's true. When you're abroad, that for sure happens. -&quot;Ugh. Oh, thank God.&quot; -It's like in Turkey, if they go, &quot;American?&quot; I go, &quot;No, Canadian.&quot; They go, &quot;Oh, sorry. Sorry.&quot; -Like, I remember the first place I traveled when I was young, obviously, was Amsterdam when I was 18. When I showed up at my first café, people literally were not that cool to me. And they started noticing this little Canadian flag on my t-shirt. Everyone was like, &quot;Oh, oh, right over here. Oh, you want a drink? Sit down. Where you from? Let's talk.&quot; And it was a little bizarre. -We're crippled with niceness. And that's a problem because the rest of the world views us as a, you know, a wussy country. -I'm confused by why and how it came to be that we are slaves to our courtesy. -Well, I think it's a little nutty, if you ask me. -We have an existential crisis of, &quot;I don't even deserve to exist.&quot; -Alanis was right. I know I had spent my entire life apologizing just to be safe, even when people said dumb stuff about Canada. But are we too nice for own good? I wanted to find out where our famous Canadian politeness came from once and for all by taking a detour off my route and speaking to an expert in the field. Hey. -Hello. Rob? -Yes. Thank you so much. -Linda Allan. -How are you? -I'm great. -Welcome back to Canada. -Thank you. -My name is Linda Allan. My company goes by the name of Linda Allan, and I'm an etiquette expert. -And do you think that it's an amazing coincidence that your company's named after you? -Uh, no. No, not at all. I purposely set out to put my name to my company. -Smart. As we discussed before, we're sort of known, correct or incorrect, for being unbelievably polite. -Yeah, we're not sort of known, we're well known for being unbelievably polite. You're right. -Expand on that. Like, why do you think that is? -Well, I think it goes back in some sense to our Parliamentarian system. You know, we hail from British rule. And difference is they're, you know, polite, everybody thinks of them as just amazingly well-mannered. -So if that camera were, let's say, the guy at a front desk at a hotel in Spain and he had done you wrong, how would you admonish him? -Well, I'd still go up the counter and I'd say, &quot;Excuse me. I don't mean to be rude, but I wanted to let you know that my bill is incorrect, and I'm wondering if you could take a look at this and just see if I'm right.&quot; So that's -- yeah. It's not very aggressive, is it? -But then if I was him, and I said in my nonexistent Spanish accent, &quot;No, I think you did order 300 pornos and all these muffins, so you got to pay.&quot; -Oh, gosh, I wish I could hit you back with something to say that would -- -Bring it. Unleash the Canadian fury. -But I think we would just roll our eyes, shrug our shoulders. We're so afraid to put someone else down or something else down because in our culture, that says more about us than the rudeness that was emitted from someone else. -Canada was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and instead of poltergeists... -[ Laughs ] -...we have apologies that are haunting us. And we're not gonna do anything about it. -Yeah. -Thank you so much. -Oh, thank you. It was a pleasure. -I bow to you. Wow. We may be sicker than I thought. Even when confronted with something we didn't do, our instinct is to beg forgiveness. I wanted to process this but had to get back on the road if I was gonna make my Canada Day deadline. But first, there was some official business to attend to. -Oh, excuse us. -Sorry, everyone. -Sorry I'm alive, I'm sorry I made it, I'm sorry I'm a success. -Sorry. -Ooh, sorry. -Sorry. I didn't do that right. -There's no wrong -- you don't need to apologize for apologizing. -Oh, sorry. -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry. -Sorry. -I'm sorry. -Hello? -Oh, my God, sorry. -I'm sorry I exist. -Oh, sorry, sorry, I'm sorry. -I'm so sorry. -Sorry. -[ Laughing ] Sorry. -Sorry. -I'm sorry these people have to listen to us saying sorry. -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry, but thank you very, very much for watching. -I'm Ann Luu, CTV News Vancouver, and I'm sorry. -♪ I've never ♪ ♪ Been so sorry ♪ Sorry. -I think we just earned our Canadian tax credits. And maybe it's not so bad being nice. But we shouldn't get too cocky because my whole life, I had always felt that our politeness actually may be covering up something a bit more sinister. Oh, yeah. -Somebody who's very close to me said Canadians are the most passive aggressive people they've ever met. -Like, I met some people in Canada who seemed to have issues. You know what I mean? Like resentments, and they didn't let it out or they didn't say anything. But, like, behind their eyes, kind of like the look you're giving me right now. Like [Sarcastically] &quot;Great answer. I love the answer.&quot; -But I actually hate the answer. -[ Normal voice ] Exactly. You hate the answer. See, this is a perfect example of the Canadian problem. -It's the home of the backhanded compliment. &quot;Hey, you're that guy from that show.&quot; You're like, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; And they'll say, &quot;Yeah, I saw that prison movie you did, though. Man, that was bad, huh?&quot; -We're nice as long as you're nice. As soon as you become a dick, then we're gonna become extra-big dicks. -That's true. -Extra-big dicks? -People think of Canadians as a peaceful people and all this stuff and not being in a big hurry to get into wars and not having handguns. But, you know, our national pastime is this game where we, like, just pummel each other. -When my friends come from Canada, they're not like the mellow ones at the premiere party that I've brought them to. They're the ones everyone's looking at like [Laughing] &quot;Who the fuck are these guys? How did they get in here? Why are they screaming and drinking 10 times more than everyone else at this party?&quot; -When we get a little bit crazy, like we riot over a hockey game or one of our mayors is accused of smoking crack cocaine, I think to the rest of the world, they kind of go, &quot;Oh, yeah, Canada. Forgot about them.&quot; And it almost gives us a little bit of street cred. -Between you and me, I think this trip is going pretty well so far. My attempt to uncover the mysteries of the Canadian psyche has been very interesting but a bit scary. Coincidentally, the same two thoughts that went through my mind when Theresa Barnett forced my hand up her blouse at our grade seven dance. But more on my junior high school days later. Right now, to stay on schedule, I needed to hit my next stop before dark. So as the sun began to set on Day 2, I zoomed on into Québec. Québec is a very significant province within our nation and to my personal history. It acts as the gateway from the Maritimes into Anglo Canada, and my mother was born there in Montreal. And going back to our supposedly boring history -- In the 1960s, Québec was also the home of our own version of a terrorist group -- The Front de Libération du Québec, who fought and killed for an independent, French-speaking worker society. The other thing I remember growing up was a lot of Québecois. My fellow Canadians kept voting on wanting to separate from Canada. Every few years, they would hold a referendum, and I would watch my parents sit nervously by the TV hoping our country would stay together. -The polls have just closed. -Our Anglo-French combo always seemed very volatile to me. So I thought this was the perfect opportunity to explore... We have two official languages that don't even like each other. -Okay, don't try to glom onto our two official languages. Does anyone speak French in Calgary? Have you ever heard it? -It has one positive effect. It kind of maintains a high degree of tension. -The only time I ever have tension towards people in Québec is referendum time because of the idea of splitting Canada up makes me mad to the point where... -Where suddenly you realize, &quot;Oh, my God. &quot;We could blow a hole in this country.&quot; And you almost want to say to them, &quot;You guys are nuts. Please stay.&quot; -Yeah. -I was never in the sort of French-English problem. I did have one of my favorite lines come out of that, which was, &quot;My father never lived to fulfill his dream of an all-Yiddish-speaking Canada.&quot; -When you start reading about what happened to the French and how they couldn't even speak in their own language, working for the Hudson's Bay and stuff like that and being fired and all that, you got to throw all that stuff in. -It's just another one of those incredible, really unique things about Canada. It's not this -- it isn't the dull, asexual country that I laughingly labeled it early on. -But where exactly did all of our longtime English-French conflict get started? I wanted to see for myself and headed to what I was told was the actual spot. This is where it all happened. Much like the two girls off to my left who are fighting for the attention of boys, this is where the British and the French had their epic battle, basically, for Canada. The generals Montcalm and Wolfe leading the French and British Army fought it out like maniacs to see who would get the future of Canada. The battle lasted 15 minutes, both generals were killed, and nothing was resolved. So a classic Canadian resolution. The English held their ground longer, and Canada became an Anglo nation. And the French stayed here in Québec in their little stronghold, and I think this is what started the French-English issue and the separatist movement. -The gap between separating in the referendum is actually getting bigger now. People do not want to separate as much today. The gap before this in '95 was 1%. Now it's even getting bigger and bigger, so the chances of it actually separating, to be honest with you, aren't very likely. -This was a huge relief to hear. And I was loving my time in Québec, which was strange to say because growing up, my only lengthy exposure to Canada's French side was on the side of my cereal boxes in the morning. But this trip confirmed Québec was awesome. My French-Canadian peeps were very cool and basically, just like me but with a higher tolerance for accordion music and underage smoking. I was beginning to think all of the ignorant comments some of my Alberta relatives made about French-Canadians being rude was completely unearned. This shows what happens when you generalize. But those cereal boxes I mentioned lead me to another question on my list -- food. Not for me, because I had just treated the crew to some killer poutine -- delicious, but it literally almost killed us. It made me wonder if you name almost any country in the world, you can list their iconic dishes, but I never know what to say when non-Canadians ask me... -In my town, I believe we had a Chinese restaurant, and there was a symbol on the front sign of a Chinese man in a coolie hat shaking hands with a Mountie. And it said, &quot;Chinese and Canadian cuisine.&quot; -[ Laughs ] -What do you think a typical Canadian meal is? If I was to make you a typical Canadian dinner, what would it consist of? -Um... -Beer. -Some beer. -Probably some good ol' Canadian beer. -Doughnuts and beer. -Maple syrup, pancakes. -Canadian bacon. -Bacon and beer. Mmm. -Canadian bacon and maple syrup. -Seafood. -What about beer and beer? -Beer and beer? Yeah. Sure, different kind of beer with another kind of beer. -It's a very subtle flavor. If America is hamburgers and steak, and if Mexico is salsa, Canada is celery. -We're from Canada, where mayonnaise was considered a spice. -My Canadian food is salmon. We'll take it fried, barbecued, dried. -To me, Canadian food is, like, sushi. Like, 'cause I'm from Vancouver, and there's sushi everywhere. -French fries with white vinegar and ketchup and salt. Om-nom! -Spaghetti and mooseballs. -Is that a family recipe? -You know, it'd go right with my beaver tartare. -&quot;I'll have a double portion of beaver, please. I'm from Canada.&quot; &quot;Excuse me?&quot; -At the exhibition years ago, they had foods of the world that was a booth. And they had, you know, empanadas and burritos for Mexico and all these different places and, like, crepes from France. And Canada had snow cones and hot dogs. [ Laughter ] -My husband and I would have dinner parties, and I would always say, &quot;Tonight we're serving Canadian food. We're eating Italian. Tonight we're serving Canadian food. We're eating Chinese.&quot; -All immigrants actually make the country, so it's a mixture of a lot of -- you know, some good and some bad, obviously. -This kind of national wishy-washiness was only raising the volume on the small voice of doubt beginning inside me about proving Canada is not a joke. Between our vast and varied native and immigrant population, how the &quot;F&quot; do we not have one famous national dish? So again, I went to an expert. -Nice to meet you. Wonderful. -Thanks for taking the time. -My pleasure. I look forward to it. Come on back to my office. -Excellent. What is Canadian food? Is there a Canadian cuisine? -The Canadian chefs just met recently for the first congress of what is Canadian food, and what it was was completely multicultural, and let's explore and be open to everything. And that's what their forgone conclusion was, is who knows what mystery will come? But they're gonna be something local from each little area. -But isn't that one of the classic Canadian moves? We don't want to offend any type of food, so we're being polite, and saying, &quot;You're all Canadian food. Of course, green beans, you're Canadian food. Yes, apples, come on in.&quot; We're this giant country with all these great ingredients available, but we never seem to have decided on what Canadian food is. Like, if I go around the world and say, &quot;Tell me a typical Canadian meal,&quot; it would be this, basically, right? -That's what they remember. Well, maple syrup, people love. And let's face it -- maple syrup's delicious. Absolutely delicious, and it's hard to get in a lot of places. -So this basically Canadian cuisine. -Right. -Well, I really, really appreciate your time and your knowledge. -I am always gonna be curious about a country that considers it to be an appropriate wintertime activity to take maple syrup, pour it on snow, watch it freeze, break it, sell it, and eat it. -If I was to put a glass of pure maple syrup in front of you, would you guys drink it? -Oh, yeah. Right now. -No. -I'm a true Canadian, I'll do it. -I had maple syrup this morning. It was delightful. -Just straight maple syrup? -Straight maple syrup -- I drink it from the bottle. -This was very interesting -- if you find a crushing lack of clarity interesting. It seemed like Canada claimed a ton of foods as our own, but maple syrup kept popping up, even on our money. But I perked up when I heard that maple syrup is also responsible for an exciting recent development in our previously assumed boring history. Can I get some important music for this part, please? [ Dramatic music plays ] Do you know about the maple syrup heist? -What was the maple syrup heist? -Recently, these guys stole -- -I did hear something about this. They stole like $80,000 worth of maple syrup. -It was actually $18 million and is our Kennedy assassination conspiracy. But this was in enigma wrapped in riddle wrapped in something that dribbles out of a tree. And it happened at a super secret location deep in the Québec countryside. The United States has Fort Knox. London has the world's gold reserve. We have a maple syrup reserve. In case there's a worldwide shortage, Canada stockpiles fives years of emergency syrup. And just like those other facilities, ours also has multiple layers of deadly, high-tech security. -Bonjour. -Bonjour. It's like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; with maple syrup. Most people think of Canada, they think of maple syrup. Why do you think maple syrup is so Canadian? One of the darkest days in Canadian history -- there was a big theft of millions of dollars worth of maple syrup. So, can you explain what happened? That may be the craziest story I've heard since the doctor found a vagina on my baby x-rays. But I still had more stereotypes to smash and got back on the road with only six days left until Canada Day. But in typical Canadian fashion, moments after I crossed the provincial border, the weather took a nasty turn. I'd grown up with this climate, so it wasn't gonna stop my quest, and it was certainly not gonna stop hearty locals from going about their daily routines. Like nice strolls through the park, people headed to work, folks visiting the local gallery, or shopping at the local supermarket. -Oui! -Ontario's home to our nation's capital and was the perfect place for me to dust off my old winter skills. [ Dogs barking ] Oh, my! You all right? Sorry. And get into my next question... -I marvel in the wintertime at how the pioneers could possibly have done it. Didn't anybody tell them that they could just turn left and be in the sunshine? Just a couple more days by wagon or canoe, and you're in Phoenix. -You know, we like to be, you know, culturally sensitive, but you got to wonder, what the fuck were they thinking? They come across a land bridge, and there's just ice and snow and nothing much to eat except seals, and they go, &quot;This is a nice place. I know we were just in Africa, but this seems nice.&quot; -Right. &quot;I'm tired.&quot; -Guys came over, suffered through some harsh winters, got fucking scurvy. Dirty scurvy -- I've had scurvy. -People came onto the prairies. They got these land grants. &quot;Hoo-ha, here we are. We're coming from oppression.&quot; And there they are, &quot;Yeah, there's land, honey, but there ain't anything else.&quot; And they built these sod huts. And women went crazy out of isolation. Canada was a country created by a lot of very lonely people, you know, clinging very precariously to their sanity. -[ Laughing ] You know, there are people who just fucking gave up too soon. -Environment Canada has issued severe weather warnings. -In Toronto, a sheet of ice coated the city last night. -I was walking maybe 1/8 of a mile, and it was 60 below, 24-hour darkness, and I was going to a friend's place. -It was like the coldest winter since 1928. -I walked out the door, and I puked the whole way. -You know that you're moving forward, but you're paralyzed, but you're like, &quot;My body is still doing this stuff, but, like, I don't know how it's doing this.&quot; -I've been stranded many times in the middle of nowhere... -Right. -...no cellphone 'cause it's frozen, freezing my butt off, thinking I was gonna die. And it's happened more than at least three or four times. -Wow. I must admit I did get nostalgic hearing all these comments. However, I felt something alarming inside. Not gas from the poutine. It was a bubble of concern that I was three days into my trip, and defining what it means being Canadian was a bigger job than I first suspected. But if there was anyone in my homeland who could give me a little help, it was the guy who runs the place. So I swung by the Prime Minister's house and was told by his strangely upbeat security detail that the P.M. was out buying snow tires. I asked the guards how they remained so positive standing in the bitter cold. And they said everyone deals with the weather in their own unique way, which was perfect because it led me perfectly to my next question. -You're stuck inside six months out of the year, eh? You just kind of go a little crazy. -The cold will do things to your head. You will start to have weird thoughts. And it depends on how you harness those thoughts. I think a lot comics are people that were very bored in the winter, who took those thoughts and went onstage with them. -It's so fucking cold there that I think that you do have to think of something on your way home as your tears are frozen on your face and there's a dead animal strapped around you and you're only 6. I think that at some point, you go, &quot;God, there's got to be something better than this! Ooh, I just thought of something funny. That'll cheer me up for a minute.&quot; -They say heat kills comedy, right? -And there's no heat in Canada. -There's no heat in Canada. Letterman's studio's always notoriously freezing cold. That's just 'cause he's trying to emulate Canada. -It's hard to be serious with a toque. Can I get a toque? [ Clock ticking ] I'm serious here. Even saying that, you know? Don't look at me like that. Don't -- Hey. Hey, don't -- Don't look at me like that. I am serious. -In Norway and in Sweden, they have the same brutal winters we have, and they come up with death metal. And in Canada, we come up with comedy. -Please. Please, don't -- This is not funny. This is not funny. I am being serious. -Yes, comedy. It goes without question that Canada is home to some of the greatest comedic minds of our time. SCTV, Wayne and Shuster, Jim Carrey, Kids in the Hall, Lorne Michaels, Mike Myers, Seth Rogen. I can safely say that per capita, Canada is the largest supplier of comedy that has ever lived. And looking back, I realize how my place of birth may also be responsible for my chosen career. So I drove into Toronto, the Mecca of Canadian comedy. It's where I went to very first comedy club and may also hold the answer to another question people are eternally asking. -I think the average kid grew up with a mix of British and a mix of the U.S. to make an all-rounded view of comedy and one which stressed satire, political and social, and an observant kind of view of the rest of the world. -That's the thing. We had access to all this stuff. And I also think the British thing was a big piece of it. -Clever guys like Wayne and Shuster on Canadian radio created a kind of national sense of humor or contributed anyway. -There's a definite preference for low status sort of characters. I always think of John Candy. Or some of Dan Aykroyd's characters are these big, broad, misbehaving sort of characters, but they're also likeable, so that's partly Canadian. -We're pleasant individuals, so most of our humor is non-threatening. It's funny without being nasty. Damn, that's a good tagline right there. -It's not humor at the cost of other people, it's humor at the cost of yourself. -Right. -Which is the core of self-deprecation, which is my favorite. -Canadians have a much better sense of humor about themselves than Americans. Hands down. -I've gone to comedy clubs where people are talking, you know, Canada-themed comedy clubs where everybody's talking about how lame we are and how lame our army is and then how lame our national symbols are and that sort of thing, and it's like, &quot;Wow.&quot; You really walk out of there going, &quot;Well, we suck.&quot; -Every Canadian kind of has an underdog status. I think that kind of gives us our funny edge, too, 'cause we're always looking to see we're the underdog and we're fighting back and we want to make fun of the big guy. -It's something that get to comment on because we're not in it. We're the -- we're the outsider. -From a comedian's point of view, if you have a touch of outsider in you, it's gonna help. That's why Jewish comedians, black comedians, Hispanic comedians -- they have an advantage. They're a minority. They're looking at the country differently. There's not total acceptance. -If you think about school yards, you're either the handsome one, the tough one, or the funny one who's trying to be funny to stay alive. -We are this group of people who have been suffering under a shadow of this enormous, belligerent, obnoxious neighbor. And how do we get back at them? -You know, every culture reacts to another dominant culture by sending the signal back. And so the Canadians are absorbing American television, American politics, and so they send it back. -It's like a Canadian sponge that sops up all the American paint and then throws it back in our face and says &quot;Happy New Year.&quot; -We have struck back at this monstrous neighbor of ours through this kind of covert hostility -- humor. -As I continued my mission west into Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and the great Canadian prairies, it suddenly dawned on me -- I use that exact same feeling of being an outsider as a comedy writer. Maybe that was the whole point. Being misunderstood the world over fueled a kind of secret, Canadian superpower. And Canada's comedic greatness isn't just limited to TV and movies. Our special sense of humor is also woven into the fabric of our favorite sports. Don't look so confused because I now present exhibit &quot;A&quot; -- curling. -I, very frankly, wish we hadn't made curling so popular because if you're Canada and you're looking for a little bit more elbow room on the world stage, curling is not the best representation... for anyone, actually. -Curling almost embodies Canada perfectly because it's cold, polite, and boring. -Absolutely. Curling is symbolic of Canada in such an incredible way. I couldn't agree with you more. It's perfect. -And exhibit &quot;B&quot; -- hockey. -Playing hockey, that is truly a shared experience with all Canadians. Tough and cool. Look at hockey fighting. They fight each other, but they have respect for each other. I saw a fight the other night on CBC, and the guy was wearing a visor, and he said to the other guy, &quot;Hang on, give me a second. I can take my helmet off.&quot; And he gave him a second. And then they went into it. That's fucking awesome. -And exhibit &quot;C&quot; and my favorite of all -- the Canadian Football League. My biggest thrill as a kid was going to Calgary Stampeders games with my dad and brother, sitting on the 55 yard line in the freezing cold. However, even back then, I asked... I'm speaking of course about the Rough Riders and the Roughriders. They even played each other, and no one said anything. [ Laughter ] -It's fantastic. -[ Sighs ] So sad. -How did that happen? I want to know. -Like, really? As creative as people we are, we couldn't figure this one out? -Well, one was Roughriders and one was the Rough Riders. And if you can't figure that out, if you can tell the difference between the two, then there's something wrong with you. -It's the Canadian quest for efficiency. 'Cause it's the same name, you can use it in each conference. -[ Laughs ] Now, look. I mean, doesn't that say it all? I mean, this is the kind of a country, you can have two teams with the same name, and people listen to the game, know who they're talking about. This is lunacy. -That speaks to our politeness. That speaks to, you know, it's like having kids, okay? Say you had nine kids -- you know, Bobby, Timmy, Sally, Mike, Phil -- whatever. You get the idea. And then one of the other kids says, &quot;Well, I like his name -- Phil. Why can't I be Phil?&quot; In America, they go, &quot;No because you're Sandy. You can't be Phil.&quot; In Canada, we go, &quot;You like Phil? I want you to be happy. You're Phil, too.&quot; -So, who's responsible for such madness? Let's ask this guy. -You know, it's funny. This goes back. So, in 1898, the Ottawa rugby team, which eventually became the football club, was named the Rough Riders. They played a really tough, violent game. And a Hamilton Spectator reporter ended up calling them the Rough Riders. And then in like 1924, the rugby team in Regina were named the Roughriders because the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had their training headquarters right near the rugby field, and they became the Roughriders, as well. Those two leagues merged then. They got two teams. In such a big country, I don't think they knew. You know, it took a lot of work to canoe and -- Listen, we spell them a little bit differently. One is &quot;Roughriders,&quot; one word. The other is &quot;Rough Riders,&quot; so... -That seems to make sense in a Canadian sort of way. But as Saskatchewan filled my rearview mirror, that voice of doubt from before was getting louder. I was more than halfway through my journey and still didn't feel like I clearly defined what it means to be Canadian. I needed a quick, little pick-me-up and knew exactly what would do the trick. [ Rush's &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; plays ] A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride ♪ Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride ♪ ♪ Though his mind is not for rent ♪ ♪ Don't put him down as arrogant ♪ ♪ His reserve, a quiet defense ♪ ♪ Riding out the day's events ♪ ♪ The river ♪ -The charge. -Was that the most badass thing you've ever seen? Let me answer for you -- yes. re-energized, I drove on. But unlike all of the amazing places I'd passed through on this trip, this next one was truly special because it was my home. I love Canada, but I really love Alberta. And I as crossed the provincial border, that annoying little voice quieted down, and I smiled because a few miles ahead lay my hometown of Calgary. Calgary started out as a rough-and-tumble town. It was one of the RCMP's most dangerous outposts, has a cool old West history, and is also known as the home to the world famous Calgary Stampede, the greatest outdoor show on Earth. Part huge state fair and part giant rodeo and part awesome, it helped put my hometown on the map. Calgary's symbol is a white cowboy hat, and when important visitors arrive there, they get white-hatted, custom-made by Smithbilt. I always thought those hats were so cool. But since I grew up there, I never qualified. My dad would bring home substitute hats for my brothers and I, and I'd dream of striding through the prairie like a Canadian Clint Eastwood. Then, in a weird coincidence, my Aunt told me how my father used to work as salesman for Smithbilt as a young man. I never knew this. So I took a shot, and they said, &quot;Come on over.&quot; Thanks a lot. -No problem. Brian Hanson. -How's it going? Rob. I couldn't believe I was actually here. Yeah, exactly. All right. So, just a warning to all the ladies out there, calm down. -Whoa. You know what? I think we're gonna have to start with a smaller one. -Have I ever looked cooler? -There we go. -40 years later, I got to cross one more thing off my bucket list. -So, Rob, where are we right now? -We are in Haysboro, Calgary, which is my old neighborhood. And we are going to the house that I first grew up in. I love this house. Right down the street was where my ill-fated toboggan jump took place. And it's also where, as a little boy in the darkened basement, I had my first experience with something incredibly strange. It would happen every night and only got worse as the years progressed. So decided to use this opportunity to finally confront the question... -I used to, you know, flipping around channels, would be able to spot a Canadian show in a second. Just because it wasn't lit well. You know, why don't they light the person's face? -Every time you watched a Canadian drama growing up, you could always tell it was Canadian because somebody forgot to turn the lights on. And then you realize, &quot;Oh, wait, that's just their lighting.&quot; -Larry Henderson -- some guy with a big mustache, you know, delivering the news. If he was talking about a bank robbery downtown, on the little board behind his head, they would have a line drawing of a crook with a mask on holding a bag with a money sign on it. And I'm watching news on other stations, you know, out of Buffalo, and I'm not seeing this kind of thing on the broadcast. -Al Waxman was always the giveaway. When Al Waxman is the mayor of your American city, you know you're in a Canadian film. -Al Waxman is Lincoln. -[ Laughs ] -They don't try to glam it up. If anything, they're trying to say, &quot;Look, we're making this show. It's not any better than you. We're not saying that we're better than you.&quot; -I was so excited about &quot;The Littlest Hobo.&quot; ♪ There's a voice that keeps on callin' me ♪ -[ Laughs ] No one's ever said in the history of man. -That's why I'm recording this. -That's the most original sentence ever said. -And you can't discuss Canadian TV without mentioning its crown jewel -- &quot;The Beachcombers.&quot; -I love &quot;The Beachcombers.&quot; -I did, too. -I think I had some, like, sexual attraction to Bruno Gerussi. -You can't explain &quot;The Beachcombers.&quot; It's a state of mind, man. -How would you pitch &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;? -Um... [ Theme music plays ] -Okay, we got an idea for a show. -Okay. -Takes on place on Vancouver Island. -You got two rival beachcombers. -Like an older Greek man. -Having a midlife crisis, who collects wood from the beach. -And he's got a nemesis named Relic that'll do anything to you to not let you get the logs. -But they still have lunch together at a little place run by a loveable, middle-aged lady, who you can imagine, at some point, had some sexuality. -The nemesis are the gentle waters off the coast of British Columbia. That's your villain. -Every week, there's a new thing happening. You never quite know what's gonna happen. -Is it different logs every week? Or is it one log through the series? -There is one problem log. Recurring. Drifter. -Sold. Let's shoot it. -I want to be at that pitch. -That thing ran for 20 years! -22 years! -Yeah. -20 years &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; was on?! -It's our &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; -Yeah, exactly. That's perfect. If you go, &quot;Would you rather watch 'Gunsmoke' or 'The Beachcombers'?&quot; Most people would rather watch &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; I would rather watch &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; -Yeah. Me, too. -But I used to watch it religiously. -Why did you watch it? -I don't know why. -I think we just got into the mode in Canada where we didn't even question it. It's like &quot;Oh, yeah, it's 'The Beachcombers.'&quot; It's crap and provincial, but it's on every night. -It's like a bad relationship. You know, you're drawn to it. You can't get out of it sometimes. -There's another important element to Calgary that affected this film. Because we had the stampede, American relatives would come visit us, and they would speak of Canadians as though we were their pets. It made me nuts because I found myself torn between how condescending they were and how I admired America's genuine awesomeness. We had &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; and &quot;The Friendly Giant.&quot; They had &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;Starsky and Hutch.&quot; So I need to ask... -A friend of mine used to describe Canada as the &quot;Hey, guys, wait up&quot; country to the United States. Hey, guys, wait up. What are you doing? -We've always felt like America's little brother. -This, like, little brother who's demanding attention in his own right. -It's like being at a party, and your friend tells great stories and you go, &quot;I like Turkey.&quot; And it's like, &quot;I had diarrhea once on a plane.&quot; Yeah, it was really embarrassing, eh? Yeah. -Dude, it's Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. That's what it is growing up next to the States. -Let's look at the iconic American motion picture &quot;Twins&quot; with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. If they were Siamese twins, that would really be the story of America and Canada. You are the Danny DeVito dangling loosely from Arnold Schwarzenegger's rear. -If Canada was gonna be a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; how would Carson bring them out to get the crowd excited about Canada? -[ As Johnny Carson ] Ah, oh, yes. That's right -- Canada. It's just North of here. I've heard of it. As a matter of fact, one time, uh, the U.S. were thinking of buying Canada and using it as a parking lot. -I'm yearning for any acknowledgement for them. -You're yearning for acknowledgement for them? -From the U.S. -For Canada. Well, that ain't gonna happen. -Americans know absolutely nothing. We're attached. You can step over the border. It's the exact same thing. -The thing that really probably hurt me the most was realizing how little people thought about Canada at all. -You know, most Americans don't know that Canada was fighting in Afghanistan. Then I'll talk with Americans who go, &quot;Well, you guys never help us out.&quot; No, we've been fighting a war for 10 years with you people. -I'd hear my family or friends say these same things. &quot;You know, Toronto's got a lot of great restaurants. In fact, a lot of people think that Toronto --&quot; And I'd say, &quot;No, no, no, no, no. Nobody's thinking anything.&quot; They haven't mentioned it. I've been there. I can't think of the last time I heard somebody mention Canada, unless they were saying, &quot;Hey, aren't you Canadian?&quot; That's it. They never say, &quot;God, you know, I really got to get up to those restaurants in Toronto. Oh, man. Oh, God, what a system they have up there.&quot; Nobody's saying shit about it is the reality. -My American friend went, &quot;Wow, I didn't know you guys were so mad at us.&quot; Right? And I said, &quot;Well, you know, I bet there's a lot of stuff, all indignant, that Americans don't think about Canada.&quot; And then I said, &quot;So, you know, what do Americans think about Canada?&quot; And my American friend went, &quot;We don't.&quot; -I know growing up in Canada, we kind of sneered at the United States, but we couldn't take our eyes off it. -Looking over the fence at what's going on next door and going, &quot;Hmm.&quot; Oh, think they're so great. You know? -In the United States, when the financial markets crash, and we don't have a huge debt anymore and we don't have huge deficit, suddenly we get really snotty about the fact -- &quot;Well, they're not doing very well, are they?&quot; It's a bit disingenuous, you know? We're not that charitable towards the United States. -It seems to be this torturous thing where we love to be snobby like you said. -But you're doing it yourself. You don't understand. You're now actually talking down to me as the American. And talking about how you think that Canadians are superior but under the guise of, &quot;We're really humble.&quot; So I caught you on your bullshit, right to your face, in my fucking mansion. [ Bell dinging ] -And another issue since I'm venting -- regardless of what other countries say, I also believe Canada was the greatest country in the world. But it's hard to maintain that feeling when your own people act as though we're second rate. So... -I remember being at a Canadian award show, and two people at different times got up and said, &quot;You see, we're second to none.&quot; And no one had brought up any... You know, second to whom? -But what is that? I'm genuinely asking because -- -I don't get it myself. -And the fear that we weren't good enough. -Right. -The fear -- even though we won the War of 1812, I believe. In 1813, the fear returned. -We seem to revel in our own second-placeness. -Because you always -- 'cause you've all been brought up to say that you were second. I've heard it from every Canadian. And we've had the conversation. And that you guys are so nationalistic, but you've always been told that you're second. And you really believe it. -That's my friend, longtime friend and my publicist, Susie Patricola. [ New York accent ] She's from New York. -Really? -And everybody in New York is number one. And they're told they're number one since birth because it's New York. -I was guilty of it myself. &quot;American Woman&quot; was really just a song by a Canadian band. But I remember the first time that Slash sat in with my band, and he and I went over the list of things he wanted to do. And you know, there were classics by Zeppelin in there and AC/DC. And he says, &quot;American Woman.&quot; And I said, &quot;Hold it. You want to do 'American Woman'?&quot; He says, &quot;Yeah, it's great. It's one of the classic guitar riffs.&quot; And I realize, yeah, I guess it is. But as a Canadian, I never really thought so until Slash told me that it was so. -There's a famous story about John Candy, where he was at Toronto airport. And a Toronto airport Canadian baggage handler turns to him and says, &quot;Hey, John Candy, you're from Toronto, right?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Yeah, I am.&quot; He goes, &quot;Let me ask you something. Why is it that when you Canadian comedians make it big, you never buy a place in Toronto?&quot; And John Candy said, &quot;What are you talking about? I have a place in Toronto.&quot; And the baggage handler goes, &quot;Oh, I thought you made it big, eh?&quot; -I like &quot;Eh,&quot; too, because eh is like, &quot;It's nice out, eh?&quot; You can't just say it's nice out. You have to go, &quot;Am I right? That's true, isn't it? It is nice out, isn't it?&quot; -And now that we're discussing it, I scan my memory banks to try and dig up when specifically I may have first learned this bizarre behavior. And then it hit me. -If I was designing the flag, I would make a little bit different that this. But it's an okay flag. -How would you redesign it? -If it was outlined in black, for example, it would just be much more attractive. -So, then by having that flag all over the world and when people see it around, they go, &quot;Oh, the Canadian flag equals Canadians are pasty and boring.&quot; -That would be a connection. That would definitely be a connection. And if the flag was made much more dynamic, I think they would see us, also, differently. Now, this, I think, is attractive. -Right. -This thing is done by a local aboriginal person, and the Canadian flag should be this. This has got a story to tell. And this is just... It does not represent us, and I'm gonna send a note to Parliament to tell them that. -Well, I think we found our next Prime Minister. But all these new revelations I was having on my trip were triggering ever more deeply buried issues and directly connected with other problems I still deal with today. Like when I describe Calgary to people from outside Canada, usually end up saying, &quot;It's like a Canadian Denver.&quot; Torontonians usually have to say, &quot;We are the New York of Canada.&quot; This always felt like some sort of classically Canadian concession to keep the conversation going. So I also wanted to know... There's a comparative thing about Canadians. It's weird like, even Canadians will say, &quot;Oh, yeah, I just got a subscription to Maclean's magazine. It's the Canadian Time.&quot; Or it's the Canadian this. -The Canadian version of -- as if nothing originated in Canada. -I do it all the time. And I think it's a way to explain it, but also to validate it, to make it seem important, which I think is hilarious because Maclean's magazine is important. Maclean's on its own is a great magazine. -Yeah. -It doesn't need to be the -- -I believe it's won the Canadian Pulitzer. -[ Chuckles ] Well, Canadian congratulations. -Yeah, I guess we could just be like, &quot;It's the Canadian Music Awards.&quot; But then we always have to throw in, &quot;Like the Grammys.&quot; I guess we just feel inadequate. -I think that what happens is because we're so close, we get everything that they have, but they don't get anything that we have. -Do you know about the contest Maclean's had years ago, where they had -- there was the sentence, &quot;American as apple pie,&quot; and they asked Canadians to finish, &quot;As Canadian as...&quot; Do you know about that contest? -Right. Yes. -So the winning entry was, &quot;As Canadian as possible under circumstances.&quot; -Yeah, which is a great line. -Yeah. -Yeah, but imagine, we would have that contest... -Yes. -...and no one could win it. -Yeah, I never liked Canada's answer to -- because nobody's asking. -We can't say what it means to be a Canadian. All we can say is we're not American. We actually define ourselves by saying we're not something else, which is sick. I mean, America has mom, the flag, and apple pie. And what do we have? We're not like Americans. -Just thinking about this instinctive urge made me crazy. We were just as good, if not better, than the next guy, right? Right?! Right? So once again, I sought professional advice. But this time, I didn't go as me. I went representing all of Canada. Marsha, thank you so much for taking the time to see me today. I really, really appreciate it. -It's my pleasure. -If you can, just a quick description of yourself and your qualifications. -I'm a psychotherapist. I basically work with individuals and also do quite a bit of couple counseling. -That is perfect because my parents are British and French, who got together in sort of... awkward circumstances, just to be polite. Live next door to this neighbor that has this amazing house and seems to have parties all the time. So, that doesn't sound like it was the healthiest beginning emotionally for me as a young country. -Well, I mean, if your parents are Britain and France, they couldn't live together, and they got a divorce. The second thing is because there's a lot of repression, you have a lot of individuals not feeling that great about themselves. -I definitely feel inferior. If I started to see you regularly, what help might you give me to get over that? -I don't know what other to say than you can't be happy, Canada, if you keep on describing yourself in relation to anything. You have to become an entity, define yourself. -But what is it -- We are a country that is great. Why don't we realize that and have a little more excitement about ourselves? What is your opinion on that situation? -Which situation? -The one we just discussed about Canada's comparative habit. I can think of another question if it makes -- It's very tense in here right now. I thought I was gonna feel better when I came here. But actually want to gently open this window and apologize and then jump and apologize. -Then I've done my job well. -I know all patient-doctor conversations are supposed to remain private, but those realizations really bummed me out. And even scarier, Canada Day was looming. I needed to get going, but before I did, I had an old score to settle. [ Up-tempo music plays ] Yeah! [ Tires squeal ] Fuck you, Macklemore! I'm back, and I'm directing a movie, bitch! [ Tires squeal ] Dumb vengeance is mine. But I couldn't savor it too long, as I had only one day left to get to Vancouver and get some sort of clear conclusion about my quest. So, reluctantly, I left Calgary. And as I drove along the Trans-Canada Highway towards the Rockies, the quiet of the road allowed me to feel terrible. I still didn't have a definitive answer on what it means to be Canadian. If I hadn't come close to it now, after crossing the entire country, would I ever? And then, adding maple frosting to my crap cake, as I passed through Banff National Park and began climbing the mountains towards the Alberta- British Columbia border, a storm hit. [ Thunder cracks ] It got bad fast. And the narrow mountain highway was closed down. I pulled off into a tiny town and realized I may not have only blown finding an answer, I may not even be able to make my simpler goal of getting to Vancouver. So while the skies drowned my hopes, I went to drown my sorrows. I was so sad. I was sad about leaving Calgary, I was sad about all the time and effort that I had put into this film, and I was really sad I had to listen to the bar's musician sing about his divorce... off-key. My trip had started with such promise. I had so many amazing experiences. But as I ordered another round and my brain got foggier, I knew that to save this movie and my quest, it would take something truly great. -Hello, Rob. Yes, it's me, the Great One. How's it going? You can't give up, not now when you're so close. Just get to Vancouver, for it is there you'll get the final answers you need. Trust me on this. Believe in your quest, and believe in Canada. Got to skate! -And then, like a maple miracle, the storm stopped, and the roads were back open. I may still make it for Canada Day. And as I headed down into British Columbia, I realized I wasn't the only one. -&quot;Being Canadian!&quot; Whoo! -Fucking Canada! -A bunch of my other fellow Canadians were headed to Vancouver to celebrate. And their enthusiasm gave me a final boost to say, &quot;Clock be damned.&quot; I may still be able to get the answer to my quest. But with only 13 hours left until midnight, was gonna be tight. [ Bluegrass music plays ] I blasted into Canada Place, where the Canada Day celebration had already began. I was greeted by a huge, patriotic crowd, some in both complimentary and non-complimentary outfits. Getting desperate, I went looking for final inspiration on what it means to be Canadian in the main convention center. I browsed the Invention Zone, proudly listing all our amazing contributions, like the paint roller, the McIntosh apple, the light bulb, the telephone, and, of course, the Canadarm. A choir politely rocked the crowd with upbeat version of our anthem. The crowd went politely crazy. [ Indistinct singing ] There was an amazing swearing in ceremony for a room full of excited, new Canadian citizens, who got a lot more excited when they saw their first official Canadian cake, obviously cut by a Mountie. But as touching and cool as this was, it didn't squash the panic building inside me as the hall shut down for the evening and the sun began to set. The only place I had left to go was the Canada Day parade downtown, so I raced off. Unfortunately, by the time we made it there, it had already started, and we scrambled to set up. The last time I was at this parade was as a little kid, decades ago. And just like me, it was a lot smaller then. And was also afraid of girls. But thankfully, it still had that hometown feel, and I was delighted by all of its classic trappings -- marching bands, pageant winners, people in colorful and exotic costumes... ...and even some old childhood friends. I even spotted some of my new friends. The excitement over my country's birthday was palpable from the huge mixed crowd. -Hip-hip hooray! Hip-hip hooray! -And through my delight, a sad realization was beginning to wash over me. Dusk was fast approaching, and I started to worry this whole trip hadn't been worth the hassle. I was getting on plane back to L.A. the next morning and still didn't have a clear, simple answer that could explain my beloved home to an ignorant and indifferent world. I was really bummed and took a seat amongst the revelers to let the reality of my failed quest sink in. But even that wasn't working because there was so much noise. I couldn't concentrate surrounded by the wild, rambunctious crowd. So I got up to leave. And then it hit me. The last time I was at this parade, people were never this excited about it. I don't know what happened, but while I was living in the States, my fellow Canadians seemed to have found an amazing new level of public national enthusiasm. Maybe it was right in front of me the entire trip. But was my old way of looking at Canada what kept me from noticing it? Watching everyone around me now, I couldn't help being overwhelmed with my own brand-new, very powerful sense of pride. -The reason I'm doing this right now is because you said it's done by Canadians, it's about Canada, and I'm proud to be part of it. -I got a star on the Canadian Walk of Fame. And I had a line in my speech, which was, &quot;I'm an actor, I'm a writer, I'm a producer, I'm a comedian, but no description of me would be complete with mentioning that I'm also Canadian.&quot; -The stars that I know that live here, in a minute they would go back to Canada, and do, mostly, sometimes to live, for their summer homes, to perform. They always like to go back home. They never want to lose the part of Canada that's in them, myself included. -I would never want to not be a Canadian. -You're always Canadian. It's something I think we're proud of, as much as we don't understand it. -You know, we'll always have a love in our hearts for Canada. -You will satirize Canada and talk about the &quot;Sorry&quot; and niceness and how lame it is in lot of ways, but with great affection. And it's a connection that we all have. -I think that Canada has kind of grown into its own in the last few years. -Be able to walk down the street dressed like this and not have my ass kicked. -We appreciate our own coolness and the fact that we are kind of under the radar and that we are more subtle. -I tell you some things. A lot of Canadian people didn't know what they have. You have gold in your hand. -I think Canadians are waking up to the fact that this about the best place in the world to live. -I think that people kind of know that now. It's like the secret's out. -Incredible. And they were all right. This movie shouldn't try to show what it means being Canadian. It should show people what it means being Canadian today. Wait a second. That was the answer I'd been searching for. And for the first time in my life, the solution to my problem became crystal-clear. I was wasting my time getting angry, trying to get the world's approval or recognition because today's Canada doesn't need it. I shouldn't feel sad that I left or mad that non-Canadians are ignorant about us because regardless of where we go or who we meet, we will always be as cool as the ice they think we skate to work on. And after all this, if someone still can't appreciate our special quirks, that's their loss, not mine. And just like that, a huge, igloo-shaped weight melted off my shoulders, and not with a second to spare. [ Bell tolls ] Mission accomplished. But even though it was late and I was exhausted from my trip, this was a moment for celebration. So I raced back to join up with my partying countrymen. Unfortunately, I may have celebrated a little too hard. I don't remember much, except that I missed my flight, everything tasted like maple, and I needed to come back to Vancouver in a month to explain a $500 summons for public drunkenness. -Sorry. -Best Canada Day ever. ♪ I wanna take you to a place I know ♪ ♪ A place that's called Canada ♪ ♪ I wanna take you to a place ♪ ♪ I wanna take you to Canada ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ I wanna take you to a place I know ♪ ♪ A place that's called Canada ♪ ♪ I wanna take you to a place ♪ ♪ I know a place that's called Canada ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Whoa-whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Sittin' all alone, and all I know ♪ ♪ Is that I wanna go to Canada ♪ ♪ Sittin' all alone, we pick up the phone ♪ ♪ And call Ramone and go to Canada... ♪ -♪ British Columbia ♪ ♪ Alberta ♪ ♪ Saskatchewan, Manitoba ♪ ♪ Ontario ♪ ♪ Québec ♪ ♪ New Brunswick ♪ ♪ And Nova Scotia ♪ ♪ P.E.I. and Newfoundland, too ♪ ♪ And Labrador ♪ ♪ And don't forget the territories ♪ ♪ Nunavut ♪ ♪ Oh, Northwest Territories ♪ ♪ Yukon ♪ ♪ And Nunavut, too ♪ ♪ That's Canada ♪ ♪ We are Canadian ♪ -So, if the Canadian national anthem was left up to me, I think it would go a little something like this.
