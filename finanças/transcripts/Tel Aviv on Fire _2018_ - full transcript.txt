Three months before the 1967 Six Day War Marwan. Manal. I was worried sick. You are late. My love, your passport is ready. You shall be called Rachel. Rachel Ashkenazi. This is a very Jewish name. The war will break out. The Zionists want Jerusalem. You must find this man. General Yehuda Edelman. It is the brain of the Zionists. We need his secrets. He must have a lot of secrets. Yehuda is our enemy. He stole our land. He's an assassin. We must seize its planes. Manal. If necessary, you eliminated. Palestine needs us. Marwan ... I'll miss you. Once we have accomplished this mission and defeated the Zionists, We will get married. In Jerusalem. You permit ? Thank you. Yehuda. I know who you are, General. "You're busy, general?" "You're busy, general?" There is a change in the text, Tala. Again ? I changed a sentence. It's nothing. A hébreu: "Ani harimon shelcha." In Arabic, it means "I am your grenade." Tala is ready? Yes, it is ready. Where is Salam? He is late. Hello. Atef looking for you. It is a foul mood. Normal. Okay, my hair? Perfect. I'm here. The office is ready? The accessories ? Yes. Then make me a coffee. With sugar? Sugar free. - Hello, uncle. - Hello. You want some coffee ? No. We turn. Do not be late on the set. Heard. We will first destroy the Egyptian air force. Once eliminated aviation we will crush the ground forces. Jordan will fall ... What are you doing ? Put it down. We will deal with later. Continue, Karim. vas-y. Action ! Jordan fall. And within days, Jerusalem will be ours. Yes ? You are busy, General? Come in, come. I present Rachel, a friend. - Hello. - Hello. She just opened the best French restaurant in Tel Aviv. We'll take a break. These Arabs are idiots. Jerusalem will be ours. Sorry, I miss you. Not. When I listen to you, mon cur "vibrant". "Vibrant" ? - That's how we say ? - Bassam? Salam, will help. Salam is our new assistant. He speaks perfect Hebrew. Speak. "Vibrate". - That's it. - Thank you, Salam. Very good. Continue. C ?? My heart vibrates. - You are a bomb. - Thank you. - No, wait. - What? - It will not. - Why ? He can not deal with the "bomb." It's rude. He can say "attractive" "magnificent" or "crisp", but not "a bomb". I wrote it voluntarily. We let. Atef? Salam, allowed to "bomb". Continue Karim. You are a bomb. Thank you. I brought you a little sweetness. Thank you. Non, it is not OK. The young man is right. He wants me to love her. Why offend me? There is a double meaning, Tala. Karim plays what is written. I do not feel it. It's insulting. Atef. Nabil. Bassam, what do you think? I agree with Tala. Selected examples given by Salam. Really, Bassam? I do not work like that. We continue, go. Say, "You are wonderful tonight". - Is not Salam? - It's good. It has large Palestinian actresses. And French diva Taking who barely speaks Arabic? It is shameful. My uncle ? You allow ? What is he doing here? Do I will soon be paid? - You're broke? - Not quite. Listening. We hired you to help us with Hebrew, not to change the dialogue. You asked me to correct errors. Yes, but let me know before you do it. - Work it out yourself with this. - Thank you Uncle. Salam? You really want to help me ? How you pronounce this word? You write the pronunciation in French? Yes. I learn my lines like that. - Unbelievable. - I know. I can do a selfie with you? The light comes from there. So ? A bomb. Your papers. If I tell a girl she's a bomb, it is done or is it insulting? If a man tells a woman that she is a bomb ... Get out of the vehicle. You heard ? Get off! "A bomb," it's an expression. We discussed the meaning of the word. - I was talking about women. - Shut up. It's a word ... Someone asked you to speak? Shut up. If he pronounces a word, throw it out. What were you doing in the West Bank? Answer! I work on a soap opera in Ramallah. Who is the soap? Tel Aviv on Fire. You're an actor ? No, I work on the dialogues. Hold. - Where did you find that? - In his car. Names of military installations, officers ... This is the scenario of the next episode. This is television. These are my notes. You wrote that? Yes of course. It is you, the writer? Yes. How is called the spy that restaurant? Rachel. And her lover? Which ? The Arab terrorist. Marwan. And the Israeli officer? Yehuda Edelman, General. Yehuda Edelman, yes. David ! You brought me a star! This is the Arabic writer Tel Aviv on Fire. You have already seen ? Once. It is anti-Semitic. With a name like that, you expect a Zionist soap opera? You should look at, it would make you progress in Arabic. Not true ? Yes. My wife watch your soap. It's for women. We have a lot of fans. Especially women. Mine does not miss an episode. God knows why. So ? How it ends? It's a secret. We must preserve the suspense. I can not say anything. There are no secrets here. What happens in the end? Who she chooses? Yehuda or Marwan? I really can not say anything ... Listening. You live in Jerusalem and you work in Ramallah. You have to go through my checkpoint twice a day. Tell me the end. Can I ask you a question ? All right, leave. vas-y. What you would end? Me ? Easy, she marries. Marwan? Of course not. Yehuda. Obviously. This is exactly what I expected. But it's top secret. Its good. David, he can go. I can recover ... No, I keep it. Go. Good evening mother. She did a good job? It progresses. He trusts him? A bit too much. I wrote a reply. "You are wonderful tonight." It's good. You have a nice apartment. Thank you. You enjoy in Tel Aviv? A lot. Who called you so late? It is home? Assi grows up! You're hiding the screen. But shut up! It does not matter. I'm with you now. That's it ? It's finish ? Since when do you care to our show? I met the writer. What writer? The guy who wrote Tel Aviv on Fire. I have the scenario of tomorrow. - Really ? - How did you get? - For the writer. - What writer? The writer I met! His name is Salam. - What's going to happen ? - Show me. Marwan will find the microphone? I know. I have not seen a microphone. It has to be in it. Search well. Why you like this series so much? It is anti-Semitic. It's not just politics. It is a romantic drama. You can not understand. Romantic, you speak! What for example ? All. Rachel and Marwan. - Marwan? - Yes. You're crazy ? He's a terrorist. He is handsome. It is manly. This is a gentleman. - It is romantic to you? - Of course ! Leash, Mom. He can not understand. - And Rachel Yehuda? - What? It is not romantic? It will not do anything together. It is an Arabic soap opera. That's what we are going to see. - You believe that ? - Trust me. Why she would fall in love with him? Only the army is interested in. I tell you that it will happen. I guarantee it. Stop talking nonsense. And the microphone? You will see tomorrow. Where is the rest? When I get paid. I have a job now. I give you one week. I'm sick of you. Count on me. Thank you. Mariam. Greetings. You work here? No, I work in television, on Tel Aviv on Fire. I love this series. - You look at? - No. I understood you was repairing TVs. No, I am responsible dialogue in Hebrew. This is for you. Salam This is our neighbor. Whoever fishing in the Dead Sea? There are no fish in the Dead Sea. You learned something. - We're going to eat ? - Go. You still live in Tel Aviv? No, I am a doctor in a hospital in Jerusalem. Really ? - Congratulations. - Thank you. Say hello to your mom. I'll do it for sure. Say ... This is the drama of your uncle? Yes. I thought so. Salam Abbas, stop. Stop. Cut the engine. Get out of the car. Slowly. Get out of the car. Hands in the air. Hands in the air. Lift your shirt and turn around. Leave it. Go do your job. Come. Need to talk. - Why ? - Why ? Your scenario is zero. It is not going well at all. You know nothing about the military. It seems that not. This is of course not. Yehuda is a general IDF. Not a fool of Arabic. What's the uniform? an Iraqi general Looks. It is Israeli. It must be manly, romantic, a gentleman. He should tell his exploits take him for a ride in a chariot. A char? It's an example ! As long as it is romantic. Let him learn to draw! That's romantic. It should not be boring. Believe me, women do not like boring men. It is a golden rule. It's possible. Here, I rewrote everything. - You've rewritten? - Yes. Tell me what you think about it. Not now. Everyone is watching. You are right. Come into my office. One. Here is better. Lily. It's good. You've already done? I read fast. It's good. What do you like ? The voices. What is the voice? It rings true. It's alive. You really think ? Yes. It's very realistic. Obviously. I know how to talk an officer. I hear the voice, and then I write. For Rachel, I was inspired in my heart ?? s. Very good. - I have to go to work. - Okay. No, keep it. It's for you. Wait, before you go ... Yaniv ! Come with me. Yaniv, stop everything and come here. Take our picture. Mouse! Perfect. You know not photograph horizontally? Show me what you can do. I can not. Uncle, I talk to you? I'm listening to you. I have an idea to the love story. You're not the only one. Get back to work. It's a good idea. It makes it more interesting Yehuda. You know what the difference between anyone and a writer? A writer sits down and writes. OK I understand. Stage 12, outside, a picnic in the desert - Where did you do your service? - Or ? In the kitchen. This is where I learned to cook. Really ? You do not cook at home? My father is a Holocaust survivor. The atmosphere at home was too depressing. I understand. I promised my parents that there would never Holocaust. So I joined the IDF. Wait. That's enough, frankly. What is this stupid dialogues? It's absurd. Why ? The army and the Holocaust? It's a joke? A spy has to earn his trust. I am a famous actress. My character has to be complex. She's right. My past is also clear. It gives more body to the characters, right? Not ! I'm the only one not to want to Zionist propaganda? Nabil, say something. I think... it should be discussed with Bassam. - Where is Bassam? - In the office. Ten minute break. Let's go. Bassam is your story. That's the only reason I'm here. For Tala we're all here. Not me. Investors want it. It's a star. That is true ? Then it will be without me! Stop everything. I am sorry. I need this job. I will not say another word. You no longer will do the coffee. Wafa leaves us. We need a replacement immediately. Listening. You speak Hebrew well, you understand the Israeli mentality and you have the ear for dialog. We want you to work with us, to write the role of Yehuda. Really ? Tala believes in you. And I'm willing to give you a chance. If it works, get a bonus. Do not worry, you'll have everything you need. Go home now. You start tomorrow. This is your chance. Okay ? Absolutely. Take that and study it well. You'll find the roles of Rachel Yehuda and Marwan. You can read diagonally. It's not Shakespeare. - Good luck. - Thank you. Hello chef. It has been a long time. You look in top form. Salam, I do not have time. What do you want ? Simply figs and a pack of chewing gum. I work in Ramallah. That's why I have not. 35 shekels. You would not have Mariam number? She gave it to me, but I lost it. Mariam ? What, Dad? Greetings. - Hello. - Hello. I climbed in rank. I am writer. Scriptwriter ? Salam, you've never written anything. You do not want up 5 minutes. You can barely write your CV. They like my work. They say I have the ear. The ear ? I listen to what people say and write. Much better for you. Thank you. You brings new me your number? I lost it. I never gave you my number. Dad, I'm going. Goodbye, girl. Take figs. They say it is the fruit of love. This is the tomato, the fruit of love. You want something else ? No. Thank you. Mariam, attends. We can talk ? One. You remember what you told me? With me, you felt like in the Dead Sea and you wanted the Mediterranean? You know how long it took me to get over it? Long Salam. Long time. - We were kids. - You were a kid. Forget it. I'm glad it works for you. Tel Aviv on Fire Do you want tea ? Why not ? What's this ? It is the bible of the series. The story, the characters ... I have to learn everything. Illuminates a little more, you'll kill your eyes. Do not worry. War is inevitable. The Jordanian ambassador plays cards with the CIA agent. It's for you, Nabil. I take care plans Marwan border. Rachel Yehuda in office. She flirts with him. She wants to know where he hides his key. It's a great scene to begin. If you have any questions... Of course. Always I eat to write. Inspiration rises from my stomach to my brain. Hummus? No. I do not eat hummus. My wife did. You're leaving finger-licking. It's a childhood trauma. A long story. - You know how to get rid of it? - No. Write. Write everything you remember. I am going to get coffee. Hi Mom. I need an advice. No, nothing to do. I said I would pay. It's about Rachel Yehuda. Listening. Rachel visits him in his office ... He is in his office and she flirts with him. You who know the series, What did she tell him? I need to start a sentence to me. Attends. What is "as usual"? What habit? "You light my life." Pretty sentence. "I like the sound of your voice." "You are strong..." What else ? "I do not know, darling, I'm not writer ..." Hanin, hello. I'm glad you're home. This is Salam. It's true that it's been. They argued and she wants to make peace. What does she say to him? Nothing ? Hello? Yes, Nabil. Where are you ? I went for a coffee. Is repeated at 14 pm, do not be late. Bassam looking for you. It's ok I got it. When will we get engaged? We'll talk later. Kiss Me. Khaled, not in a public place. Hiyam, I love you. Tell me what to do. It's nice. Very pleasant. Let's go. I talk with the commander Assi Tzur? He is not there. Advanced. I can perhaps wait? No. Either you pass or you leave again. It really is... Recedes. Yossi ! Yossi! I know him. Let him go. Come with me. I want to talk to the commander Tzur. You saw your scene of the Holocaust? What do you want ? I need an advice. About General. You know the army. I will pay you. What? You're trying to buy me? Of course not. I do not want money. Hummus ... Bring me a good Arab hummus tomorrow and I'll think. I have a deadline. A delay, really? It is 12 hours 17. Go ahead. Where can I find good hummus here? Continue straight ahead. - It is good, hummus? - Yes. Really good ? What do you mean ? This is hummus. It's for a friend. He is difficult. He is not here? It is Israel? No, he is French. Good. It smells good. There are lemon. Good. About Yehuda ... We must first talk of marriage. What marriage? Marriage in the end, between Yehuda and Rachel. It's a great idea, but we have time to see coming ... We do not have time. That's my price. I want this marriage, period. Okay. What? Hide your joy. It is an excellent idea. In all honesty, Salam your soap ... it does not fly very high. But with such an end, an Arab and a Jew who marry, that will make a carton. It's certain. It is a stance. No more checkpoints, conflicts ... I could escape from here. That will please my wife. So ? It's possible ? Of course. Bargain ? Yes. You will have your wedding. Okay, here we go. What do you need ? This is the context. She flirts with him. She wants the key to his desk drawer, where he keeps his secret plans. Plans in a drawer? It is in the Middle Ages? It's easier for spectators. What audience? Millions. Israelis too. Okay, the key. The key is to know where he hides. Where he can hide his key? Where is the key to the office? He has to keep him on a chain around his neck. It's safer. I love this idea. It's stupid, but it is you who want a key. Rachel visits him. Why ? Because he has not called back. She enters the office, Yehuda is there ... He looks tense, tired. She tells him... "What's going on, sir?" He is happy to see her, but he said ... Voltage. This tension is killing me. "My people need me, "times are hard." And the key? Hold on ! You get there. Then she said ... she tells him : "You look tense. I'll give you a massage." A massage... It passes behind him ... That's it. A massage. This is the key to your heart ?? c? This is the key to everything. The key scene is great. Uncle, I read the whole story. Let's talk about the end. What end? - The last episode. - The end is excellent. I tapped into the Maltese Falcon. - You saw it ? - No. You have to see it. A chef d'oeuvres ??. Humphrey Bogart It Mary Astor fall in love. Corn Mary Astor killed the partner of Bogart. Humphrey Bogart stops and the pound to the police. She said: "Why, my love? "I love you". He replied: "I love you too. "But duty comes before love." You make the connection? Not really. Rachel Yehuda are in love. She wants to run away with him, but it is a dilemma. His dilemma is similar to that of Humphrey Bogart. She passed the duty before love. Then she blew up with him. I stole this end in Hollywood. You understand ? Excuse me, but this is sewn with white thread. We have already seen that. You do not change a good end. Is not it ? - God forbid. - Why not a surprise? The surprise ? What would happen if Rachel Yehuda married? The effect would be more dramatic. Right, Nabil? Rachel Yehuda together? It would be like new agreements of Oslo. Oslo? The great illusion that changed nothing. Nabil will explain. Sorry, I have to take this. We do what scene? What scene? The war broke out. This is a great stage for Yehuda. A complicated scene. Rachel Yehuda and drink and talk about love. You ever been in love? Me ? - Yes one time. - Only once? And? You got married ? No. It did not work. Pity. What we see a man and a woman are in love? They hug and kiss. They listen. Never forget that. Can you do me a favor ? What? This photo... take it and lay it on camera. A surprise for my wife. - It does not depend on me. - It is a service. Not an order. I'll give it to someone on the board. Do your best. Thank you. Top model. The scene. The scene. She is alone in the restaurant, it comes to see ... I have an idea. I worked as a bartender. Looked. Do not interrupt me. I'm thinking. Listening. Yehuda full of emotion, it must end with a kiss. Their first kiss. A kiss that will change the life of Rachel forever. Write. Yehuda enters the restaurant, brandishes a bottle of champagne and said: "This is the greatest day of my life and I want you to be with me. "Rachel, you're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen." "You're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen." Pardon ? You told me? Not. What is this picture ? It's nothing. I found in the accessories. I asked here to inspire me. I also have a picture that inspires me. That of a check. My last salary. Scene... "When I was young... "I was agitated ..." What's wrong ? - You're in trouble, Assi? - No. What do we party? This is a great day. The first kiss of Yehuda and Rachel. It's not too early. I was beginning to despair. The war broke out. Bonsoir, Oum Samer. How are you ? When I was young, I was agitated ... You might push you? I did not keep up 5 minutes. But by your side, I could stay forever. Yehuda... You do not believe me ? Of course yes. I know the writer. You're a soldier, and soldiers do not lie. Take care of yourself. She knows the writer. Tell me what we are celebrating. Jerusalem will be ours. And the people? The Arabs of Jerusalem? Our army is the strongest in the world. We will set up checkpoints controlled by our best men. My love, it is a victory. Enjoy it. You'll see. You call that a kiss? What is the problem ? It is an Arabic kiss. You read the papers? Look ! "Tel Aviv on Fire to boot Israelis ... "The Palestinian television stamped kosher." "The moral is lost in Tel Aviv." Investors are crazy mad. Because of what ? From a small kiss. They barely touch! Uncle, what worries you? This is viral on Facebook. Who reads newspapers? Investors read newspapers. And they demand the return of Marwan. We hummus? You do not like that. I do not worry. He takes me to the job. Hello. It's not open yet. You hummus? I have some old cans. Perfect. Why you ruined the kiss? I was talking to a real kiss, that the change for life. I make promises to my wife and you give me a kiss Arabic? What's this ? Like that, without language. It's more dramatic. It shows his inner conflict. Stop kidding me. When I give you a scene, do not change a comma. - Got it? - Hey, your hummus. What's this ? What have you brought me? There is a grocery store in my neighborhood. The guy at least 90 years. It opens 2 hours per week. Perfect. What flavor, what flavor! A taste of old. At work ! What are we doing today ? The scene where she steals the key. What? Stopped. Again this key story? For her to stay with him, he needs a victory. If you say so... - What? - Commanding officer. What do I do? He has no papers. Not now. You see I'm busy. Keep it. I'll come earlier. Go. You were saying ? The key. Yehuda are lucky bureau. Let me concentrate. Yehuda are lucky bureau, Rachel left alone. She looks at his medals. Shut up. I found. Listening. She must bring her a dessert restaurant, a sweet thing. And his medals? What medals? They are home. Medals! She brings her a dessert and said: "I brought you as soft sweetness than you." He replied: "Rachel ... "You spoil me too. You're gonna make me fat." He stroked her cheek and said: "Everybody loves you. "Why did you choose me?" And she said: "Because you're beautiful." He answers : "No, that's not the reason." "Why not? Any woman would want a beautiful general in perfect profile, "Black hair." He tells him : "Because we are neighbors. It's practical." She says: "I could come from anywhere, "A place ... "You do not even suspect, "My feelings are the same." Not bad. Then they hug. And she puts her hand covered in flour on his chest. It's good. - On the key. - It's clever. It is a professional spy. Good. I understand the idea. She wants to take the key fingerprint to make a double. Wait a second. She comes, she sits ... What were you saying? - What? - What were you saying ? She could use the dough instead of flour. The key fingerprint will be sharper. Yes Super. I will think about it. Listening. Tomorrow she goes to see Marwan. Spend time with him. Okay, but not too long. I do not like this terrorist. For us it is a freedom fighter. - A freedom fighter? - Yes. I thought you were smarter than the others. I thought of that too. I know that Marwan. I know all the Marwan. It's my job. better than you are known. Come back tomorrow. I have a scene with Marwan. No it's OK. I'll figure it out. - Hello. - What? I'll manage without you. "I could come from anywhere, "A place you do not even suspect ..." I just love it. It's beautiful, I love. Thank you very much. I begin to hear voices. You know what ? You should go to Paris. But I do not speak French. You have a good ear. You will learn quickly. You know what's more beautiful in Paris? The people, the atmosphere, the climate ... There is no occupation. Okay, I'll go to Paris. Salam, we can talk? Listening... it's about my character. Yehuda is an Israeli general. It should not be hard? It is always tender and sympathetic. It does not please you ? I spent 7 years in prison in Israel. They are not really nice. You are right. I will work on your naughty side. - Great, thank you. - You're welcome. They want a radical separation. But viewers watch for Rachel Yehuda. It's temporary. But there will be more history. They want to show the cruel side of Yehuda. Easy. He has to shoot a few children. Not bad. No I'm kidding. Not me. He will be charged with murder and imprisoned. That way, she will stop to see it. Its role is important, but ... - Too complicated. - You want easy? It kills. That way, they will be separated. This is the star of the soap opera. If the on Tue, we will have no end. If there is an end. Her cousin came to his funeral. A pretty cousin. She's younger, cheaper, less capricious and we have a new star. It will not kill Rachel. - Can I say something? - Yes of course. A new love story is a great solution. One can concentrate two minutes? Very good. How can we separate them without destroying the story? - Neither the drama. - And without killing anyone. I have an idea. No ! It's impossible ! - What is going on ? - She has cancer. Who ? Rachel ! Not now. I do not want you sick way. What's the matter ? Who is dead ? Nobody. This is television. You always love me ? Or do you prefer ... search for other fish in the sea? Come see ! Rachel has cancer. What cancer? She will die. You did not tell me they got married in the end? Hello. What do you want ? I want to get the hummus. I do not pay. I do not want any money. It is outdated. Throw it. Goodbye. Salam Abbas, the writer? It's me. What's the matter ? You are wrong. What do you want ? It's a misunderstanding. Do not kill me. I did not do anything ! What will Rachel? I know, I swear. You know nothing? Aces? Writer my two. You think you can write what you want? How many times you promised me a wedding? Seven times ? Ten times ? a deal was concluded. And suddenly she has cancer? You really want to shoot me? And your stance? Ton happy end ? It depends on you. Look, she's not dying. Okay ? On TV, we can cure everything. A cancer is like a toothache. We cry a little and it passes. Let me do my job. You'll be the cure? Yes. - She will not die? - No. - And there will be a wedding? - Yes. Its good. Take your wallet. But I keep it. You see your ID? I keep it. This is my guarantee. A marriage against your ID. But this is my card. Indeed. Salam Abbas, you're under my control. You will do as I say. You may not enter Jerusalem in my absence. Understood ? Yes I understood. You shall have the wedding day. Now, do what you gotta do. And do spend my photo on TV. It's an order. David, releases it. You are late. It's okay ? A small setback. Here. You were called. Where is Tala? I have to talk to him. She is not there. I try to join his agent. Why ? This is chemotherapy. She will not lose her hair. Who said anything about chemo? Me. It is very visually. We were doing chemo in 67? Yes, I checked. Why did you do that, Atef? Why ? I come again. still tries to join. This is Salam. You can talk ? You send me messages? What do you mean ? "A fish in the sea ... "I could be anywhere, "My feelings are the same." That is true. It was you who wrote that? It's me. You have given up more than 5 minutes? Much more. They dine together? Tonight... 20 hours, it suits you? Maissa? - You can come in costume? - Of course. I come again. - This is a great opportunity? - A dinner. I want to replace Tala. Tala will come back. I know. But if she does not come back? - You will think about me ? - Okay. Try this. Between. Nice suit. I borrowed Marwan. For me ? I have an appointment. Of course. You are gorgeous. Between. Take a seat. Make yourself at home. I was going to send you a message. I returned to Paris tomorrow. Why ? I have better things to do than die from cancer in Palestine. Nobody is going to die. You did not have cancer. It was a misdiagnosis. Cancer is a breach of contract. I do not care. My lawyer will handle. You know what bothers me? What? I write beautiful scenes and someone else will play. I'm listening to you. Instead of a cancer ... a marriage. The life and not death. Who is getting married? Rachel Yehuda et. Not. No way. Not if you stay a spy. Think. You move toward the altar. You smile, but c ?? broken heart. The music is Israeli, but in your head, you hear a Palestinian dance. You're an angel dazzling overwhelmed by grief ... I can read the scene? I have not yet written. What? It is not yet written. But it is there, right? Then write it. You can use my computer. Not now. I have an appointment. What? You shall never career if you do not make your priority. But it is an appointment really important. Tomorrow. Tomorrow I fly. Unless I read the scene tonight. I have to call. Do this. Girls, I'm all for today. Mariam? Hi, this is Salam. I recognized your number. I have an emergency at work. We can see each other tomorrow ? I have to stay to finish a scene. Where are you ? With whom ? I am... I'm at Tala. Okay. Hello. Mariam. Good night. Hello, this is Mariam. Leave a message. You still write ... It smells good. It's the last ? It's poetry. Really ? Really. The bride arrives. Yehuda is waiting there. She looks at the audience and sees that uniform. She is oppressed, she thinks of the war ... It's unbearable. She chokes. This approach Yehuda ... - It's okay ? - Very good. Keep on going. All these uniforms around her stifle, she fainted and collapsed. speak, This is a crucial time for you. Focus on the face of Tala. All hesitations, contradictory feelings, the emotions... In the background, we hear only the beating of his heart ?? c. - I want a beautiful wedding dress. - We'll see. Bassam, it will be spectacular? Absolutely. Atef must hide crucifix. A Jewish wedding in a church? We will only have to put stars of David on top. Exactly. Well done. Everything is perfect. We will do as you said, with a small change. She collapses and over, while still holding her bridal bouquet. And what there is in this bunch? A button ! And boom! No, uncle! It spoils the whole scene. But my boy, nowadays, there are more than Romeo and Juliet. - That's enough. - But, uncle ... Everyone at work. Go. What are you doing here ? Nothing. I'm thinking. Marriage provides a second season. Enough Salam. Go home. Go rest. You do not want the second season? Me no, investors either. That's enough ! I can talk to them? My little Salam. When one becomes a writer, it has a responsibility towards its people. This soap does not come from nowhere. I fought in 67 for the freedom of our country. We had a soul, but we lost after Oslo. I'm doing this series for you and your generation. To get all that we lost. I speak of history. How does this story help us? What she brought us? There is nothing between the bombs and submission? I understand my responsibility, but it must evolve to live the soap. If Rachel continues to spy, it continues to work. We will do what you want in the 2nd season. - Investors will not accept. - We do not care ! - They do not live here, we though. - No. Never repeat that. Give me that chance. Let me think about it. Thank you Uncle. Hello, this is Mariam. Leave me a message. Hello. Call me back. I do not want to lose you again. Health. ID card. It is from your commander, Assi. You can not pass without papers. Ask Assi. I have to go home, it's urgent. Turn back. Come on, turn around! You see there? I see nothing. Beyond the sea. It's Jaffa. I would die for goodbye Jaffa. Palestine miss. Hey are you good ? Salam, wake up. - What time is it ? - 7: 30 pm. You spent the night here? The checkpoint was closed, so I came here. Come on, get up. Here. Thank you. Change yourself. You think I'm right? The bomb is a cliché and a wedding is better? You want practical or artistic response? The answer practice is that I want to pay my and that marriage would allow a second season. The artistic response ... I do not want the story ends in 67. It was a tragic year. I want us to introduce new characters, the story continues again and again, as in the American series. Forever. As Palestine. Nabil, you're a poet. Do not exagerate. - Hello. - Nabila between. Here. How are you ? Good. - This is Marwan? - Yes, open. Figs? I do not understand. Marwan think the fig is the fruit of love. He is wrong. It's tomato. You hear ? He learned his lesson. It is not perfect, but he made an effort. The essential, that he loves me. - Hello. - You are an early bird. I have to finish the wedding dress. You wrote the scene on the fruit of love? Yes. I read that somewhere. The tomato ! I liked it. I love your dialogues. I hope I can play one day. I'm an actress. - You do not know maybe ... - I know. Thank you. Pass me Marwan. - Rachel is ready. - Perfect. But her name is Manal. In Tel Aviv, it is called Rachel. Beware the false name does not become true. Manal, love. Your time is near. I will always be with you. You are sure to marriage? We lost the war, but not our love nor soul. This Arabic up to something. It's ok I got it. Go back to work. My wedding dress. What do you think about it ? She is magnificent. If only Marwan was at your side ... But the fate of Palestine comes first. Nabila, I can confide anything? Of course. What is it ? Come and sit down and tell me. I like Yehuda. It's bad ? I thought you liked Marwan. Yes, I like it too. Have you forgotten the massacre of Deir Yassin? Not. Of course not. Very good. Here. Take this. It is a detonator. Cover it in your bouquet. When the time comes, press this button. And everything will be over. Cut! It's very intense. It is also the end of my writing career. Why ? Whatever. It's a long story. Salamush. How was it ? Awesome. - I am a big fan. - Thank you. Its stage is incredible. You can lift my veil? I want to know what it feels like to marry. - It's beautiful. - Thank you. He's a genius. I took him to Paris. Really ? No. It's just an idea. Tala, we're ready for your close-up. - I arrive. - Go. See you later ? Where are we going ? I come here when I need to think. At least I have peace. Stop messing around. You go when in Paris? - You want to come ? - Really ? And I will do what, there? My life is here, my work, my family. I like living here. I have nothing abroad. But the world is big! It's not just Paris. There Rome, Tokyo, Australia ... amazing places. - You know, the most beautiful? - What? There is no occupation. Are you still looking a new sea. No. I want you to come with me. So stay. Okay, I'll stay. It was an Arab kiss? I'll check. It's too much. I can not breath anymore. It will not, love? All these uniforms ... It oppresses me. It's too much, I can not stand it anymore. I do not understand. You will never understand. Where's the other picture? - I threw it. - Or ? Viewing in this box. My uncle ? Its good ? You want a wedding but you do not trust. This is the protocol. Come and sit down. This is the best Palestinian hummus. Truth, no hummus box. Canned? What moron would eat hummus box? At the beginning of the first intifada, the army took control of Shuafat. We could not leave the house for a month. We had nothing to eat apart hummus box. I was 6. A month was an eternity. Since I have never eaten. Why not come to you at the checkpoint? I hate it as much as hummus box. We hate all the checkpoints. You do not have to do that. Stop rehashing bullshit Arabic. Why you made me come here? Our market is hanging? I have always your ID. Look around you. This marriage is absurd. It is an illusion. It is as absurd today than 67. Reality must change to make this marriage to take place. I have another idea. What's this ? - Hold. - Thank you. You know how to recognize two people in love? What? They listen. What? I do not see the link. I have a new proposal. Eat. I'll explain. Kiss Me My Love. The time has come. The rabbi! Dear friends. We are gathered here today to celebrate your wedding and your arrest. Assi, is that you? Together in prison. This is your place. What? Not ! We... we know everything. As for you ... you are the shame of the Jewish people. I do not understand. I love it. - Rachel, tell them. - My love ! This is an illusion. You can get married. In hell ! - Rachel ! - Yehuda. My love ! I can not believe it ! - You knew? - No. My Assi, you go on TV! - Dad, did you like? - Yes. They pay you to write? You pay me, yes. I do not watch TV but this actor, I know. He played in what? You pass the checkpoint in Ramallah? You're kidding ? You'll see. Salam's promu. You permit ? Thank you. Ephraim. You did not tell me your name. Avital. season 2 "The struggle continues"
