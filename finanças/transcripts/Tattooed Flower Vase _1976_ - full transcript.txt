You were so absorbed in yourwork that you didn't hear me. I'm sorry. You must be tired. Are you hungry? Starving. You could've had something on the bullet train. It's not good to starve yourself. I was saving my appetite for one ofyour home cooked meals. I'll prepare something right away. I want to take a bath first. All right. A sad woman And dreams always go together Withyour wishful dreaming You feelyou should hope For an ordinary life But drawn by something undeniable You will have a little dream Once again tomorrow H ow was Kyoto? I t was hot. I t won't cool down there unti I late fal l. Did you take any pictures for your project? Some. I thi nk I have enough. You'll be graduating from college next year. Ifyour father were alive... I feel sorry foryou. You only lived with Dad for six months, and then you were alone. Oh, but I had you, Takako. I'll stay single, and we'll live together for the rest of our lives. No, women must get married. Do you want to remarry? Fine, you can get married. Stop it. Mister. Hurry! What is it? mrs. Yoshino is here. Okay, I 'm coming. I 'm sorry that you had to come in this heat. Next time, I 'll come to your house. No, it's fine. It's nice to get out for a change. Actually, I'm curious to see your work space. We can help ourselves. Ifyou prefer that, I'll leave you alone. You'll like this. Here, have some. No, I'd rather... Come on. When it's hot like this, this boosts your energy. Have some. You wanted to talk to me about something? Since our exhibition last month, these dolls have suddenly become popular. So I'd like you to deliver around 300 pieces a month. But I can't make that many by myself. I'll find people to help you. I was thinking that you could give a doll making class. I'm not good enough to teach people. That's too bad. Your Kabuki dolls are considered superior to those ofyour late husband. That cannot be true. But it is true. By the way... I heard that your father was a wig maker who worked at the Kabuki-za Theater. As a young girl, you must've been a frequent visitor backstage. The world of Kabuki must be full of things we amateurs know nothing about. Mrs. Yoshino. It stopped raining. Let's go. How much is it? - 500 yen. - Here. Thankyou. See you again. Oh, Michiyo. Long time no see. Want some sake? Some hot tea. I had some sake already. You don't usually drink during the day. I happen to have a good tea that a customer gave me. I saw Takako the other day. I just caught a glimpse of her in town. - She's become a beautiful girl. - Thanks. I admire you. You've raised your stepdaughter all byyourself for the last 1 0 years. All that's left for me to do is marry her off. J ust one left. And you, any romance in your life? I'd rather not be troubled by men. Where's the passion you had before? You were crazy about Kikusaburo. There was no night or day foryou without Kikusaburo. Stop. Kikusaburo was amazing in Dojoji. I still can't believe someone like him is dead. You're still angry with me. Here's the payment for the dolls. Please leave. I apologized about the other day. I'll take responsibility for that. Stay away from me. Look at that. Throwing your precious doll at me. You're attractive when you get angry like that. Leave me. Michiyo. You and I are on intimate terms now. Michiyo. I know every part ofyour body. No. Michiyo! - Michiyo. - No. No, stop it. Stop. No! Michiyo- Please leave! All right, all right. Hello. Takako is hurt? Takako. There was no need foryou to come. Leave me! Excuse me. Are you Miss Yoshino's family? Yes. You're the one who called me? Yes. I'm Ogata. Mr. Ogata. I'm sorry. It was my fault. She came out of the alley so suddenly, I couldn't swerve in time to avoid her. How badly is she injured? It appears that her knee was hit by my car. She's just had an X-ray taken. I'm sorry. Really? No! You're quiet tonight. Uh-oh, she's started singing that song. Mama, let me have some ice. Get it yourself!. - Oh, man. - You gotta get behind the counter. She won't get up when she starts singing that song. Hey, bartender, give me a beer! All right. Am I busy or what? - Here you go. - Give me another. You're a customer now? Bartender, give me a brandy! - Brandy! - Okay, it's coming. Here you go. Give it to me. For whose eyes Tsing, tin, tin Do I paint my lips And dye my teeth? All foryour eyes my love Welcome home. How's your i njury? Let's go upstai rs. Excuse me. I 'm sorry for what happened. Thank you for brining her home. The injury isn't serious, but she's upset. She's behaving willfully. I'm sorry. Don't mind me. Please have a seat. I'll make some tea. Ouch. That's a doll from Dojoji. Oh, that's- Hanako the Dancer. You're very knowledgeable. My father was a Kabuki actor. Kikusaburo Ogata. You knew my father? Yes. I see. Hanako turned into a snake to pursue her beloved Anchin. That is the legend told in Dojoji. I have a childhood memory of my father's performance in the play. Mr. Ogata. Mr. Ogata! Excuse me. What were you talking about? J ust about her dolls. What's so interesting about those faceless dolls? Listen, it hurts over here. Could you take a look? Ouch! Ouch. It's okay. Make love to me. I'm scared. You'll be fine. Ladies and gentlemen. I n this month of September Takenojo will succeed to the name ofTamanosuke Ichikawa, the second. To commemorate the name-taking, he will pay his respects to you from the boat on the river. Ladies and gentlemen. I n the play for the summer festival, Hanshi will be played by Tamanosuke, the second, whose former stage name was Takenojo. J ihei will be played by Kikuemon Nakamura.

These are designs for tattoos. For tattoos. Master, I'm here. Great timing. I'm going to put color into his tattoo. Why don't you watch how it's done? I'm sure you'll get to understand what tattooing is. Let's do it. The orange light Comes through The white lace curtain When I open it The blue sky Is painted with white flowing clouds The birds sing I ' m ti red. Pedal on your own. My hat blew off. Get it back for me, please. I love that hat. We're movi ng away from it. I 'l I hel p you. Now we're getting there. Hello. No, I can't come. Then could I see you there? Please come without fail. I can't. Please... My father left this house to me. There's something I really want you to see. These were my father's costumes. I understand that there are many costume changes in Dojoji. No, you shouldn't- Please. This mirror was my father's, too.
