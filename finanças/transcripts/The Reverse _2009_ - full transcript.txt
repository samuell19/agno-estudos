present in THE R E V E R S E 1000 people as one. Sure moves, uneering manoeuvres. The military gymnastics show, with its precision and good coordination, makes a great impression. Clean-limbed and strong are the young soldiers of the Polish Military. NOWINA PUBLISHING HOUSE And I would prefer you don't disappoint me, comrade. We don't need a plane to transport furniture. It's politics, not culture. Do you understand what I mean, yes? I'm waiting for the confirmation. Fool! What is it that you're coming with, Ms editor? Wodzicki's problem? Here... No, It's not a big deal, Sir. But only you can solve it. Our HR manager decided we would wear sport uniforms for the parade. It's not her idea, but a top-down directive. A healthy body in a healthy mind, or maybe it's the other way around. Only that the children's literature has been assigned to ping-pong and tennis. Fiction will be the javelin, the discus and the hammer. And we, the poetry, are supposed to be the figure skaters... That was my suggestion. Isn't poetry like sliding on the clouds? And what about our young bard, Marcel Wodzicki? Does he already know that we won't publish him if he doesn't agree even to the smallest changes? - He is coming tomorrow to learn about your decision. - My decision? If it was only up to me, getting such a poet would be our biggest success. - Were you in the Warsaw Uprising? - No, I couldn't. I mean, I didn't want to. But you might have. I think you should be nicer to him. I know, you don't know how to be unkind, but I'm thinking about your generation's ties. I always offer him tea when he comes, and recently I brought a cake from home. That's it, home... Please take him out of this building. You must have mutual friends from before the war. And much in common, for sure. We need to persuade this beautiful young man that if he only takes a small step backward, he will go forward. We'll make him a national poet. Sabina, they have announced that all gold and hard currency must be turned in. Those who don't comply will be punished. - But Mum, we don't have any gold. - We do. Well, yes, we do. I haven't told you, but Grandma has been keeping a golden coin that Grandpa brought from Siberia. He got it from some American, a fur merchant. It is a one-dollar coin, Sabina, so the punishment may be severe. We should ask Arkady. Yes, Arkady. I already know what my boy is going to say in this matter... Rubbish, it's just a stupid law. And if you are that much afraid, give it to me. I will keep it upstairs, in my studio. It will be safe there. The liquor is on the left but I don't know if you should try it right now. Mum, do we have to talk about some gold? But Sabinka, don't take it too lightly. There may be great penalties for this. - There will be house searches. - But mum, you're not letting me tell you that Marcel Wodzicki - is going to visit me. Is this the one who was buried under the ruins for so long? A great poet. Sabine... Single or married? Is it my imagination, or are you keeping secrets from me? But of course no, Grandma! An admirer is coming to visit Sabina. Mum... Don't be shy. Finally someone has appreciated you. Sabinka, my dear child... I am so happy, so very much happy! Irena, what kind of cake will you bake? Well I don't know. How should I know if I don't even know when this man is coming? Sabinka... Don't you think we have lost everything except our lives? I think I know what you mean, but it's not that bad. We have to live, despite all of this. And you have to exist as a poet. Your Lament For The Burned Down City was right on target. Now, unfortunately, the times ask for something different. - But you still have to be present. - Thank for this "unfortunately". I know what you want to tell me. Shouldn't we just live hoping that all this mess will end one day? And if it does not? And your life, miraculously saved in the Uprising, passes by? The director wants you to give just one little sign... - A sigh... - Perhaps. A sign you are ready to humbly accept critique. Then your sadness will be accepted, too. And you will be the greatest poet in this country. Who deserves it more than you? I'll recite my poems to my wife and daughter when she is born. I will become a domestic poet... And give my regards to your mum and tell her that it was not a cake it was a miracle. Married? Well... Don't forget to leave the key with a janitor! - Do you think the director is still in his office? - Go and check. Sometimes he stays late. It says "liberty" and if "Liberation" means freedom in French, that is what it means here. 1881. It must have historical value. Shouldn't we donate it to a museum? And which museum would take it? a dollar coin that says "liberty"? Even the dumbest employee would think it's an entrapment. The police would be there before you leave. What if we bury it in the backyard? At night? They will see you. There is no escape. Sabina, the peace and safety of our family is the most important. You'll go and take it to the authorities tomorrow. - Or better yet I'll do it. - No. I'll take it. Mum... Bring me the coin and give this receipt to mum. Look, such a neat seal... Do you remember my counterfeits of the German passes? Were there anybody in Warsaw better than me? My genius... a beautiful receipt. And don't you worry about the coin. I've found the right hiding place. Only the devil could find it. Mum, may I ask for the last aria from Madama Butterfly? Oh dear! Puccini again? You know I don't like him. Do I still have a say here? Just this one aria, Grandma, and we'll put on whatever you like next. - All right. - I'll make some tea. Still not ready? We'll be late for the airport. I am sorry, but I don't feel well. I still have some work to do... Say hello to Marek from me and tell him that tomorrow, tomorrow we'll all go to the cemeteries. You promised not to drink. And generally I had kept my word... I started just a minute ago. Help me. I have found a proper candidate and she's not even interested. And why won't you give the man a chance, Sabinka? An accountant, single, everything's in order, works for the drugstore management. Good credentials, I checked. And, regardless of the easy access to alcohol, he doesn't drink. Mum, do you have to think for me in these matters? Who should think of you if not your mother? Do you think your Grandma wouldn't want to have a grandson? How about you? You'll be all alone when you're old. There will be noone to hand you the bedpan? Sabinka, an accountant, he can probably count... Don't joke, mum. Sabina, Sabina, I invited him to our place. Please, dress nicely. Look him over, only objectively. If you don't like him, nobody is going to make you marry him. Your punctuality is legendary, Mr Joseph. Here you are. This little bouquet is for you, madam Irena... Thank you very much. Please come in... Oh don't take off your shoes, please. I have to introduce you to my daughter. Sabinka! This is my daughter Sabina... Mr Joseph, about whom you have heard so much good from me. You are very kind. And your daughter is as pretty as a dream. Let me drink once more to this house's health. I know from your mum that you work in culture. Yes, Sabina works for a publishing company. That's a difficult field, isn't it? That's what they say. I don't have much time to read. Life is short and there is so much to do. But I got my respect for books from my mum, who read a lot. When I was working during the war at the treasury, I swear, I was so nice to that lady writer who opened a kiosk on Belwederska Street. And she knew nothing about accounting. What was her name? - Zofia Nalkowska? - That's right. I just needed a hint. So many names in my head... If you don't mind me asking, do you represent any particular department? Polish poetry. Oh, you got me here! Poetry... it's an endless subject. I've got such an idea. Why don't you stay for supper... - We are having such fun talking. - If I am not bothering you... Not at all, please stay. Sabinka, tell Joseph about the uniform you'll be wearing at the parade. - Should I turn on some Schumann? - No, no. Not yet. I will serve something to eat - Aren't you hungry, Mum? - No, no. I'll eat after he leaves... Go ahead. If I don't answer, I'll get embarrassed, and that's it. - Sixteen times eighteen? - Too easy. Too easy. Two hundred and eighty-eight. Miss Sabina, you don't believe in me, but I beg you, don't spare me... I would prefer three digit numbers. 228 times 314, for example. - 228 times 314? - 71, 592. Do you want to check? I believe you. I see you are good with people, Miss Sabina, because I have no equal in multiplications. As for dividing... Mr Joseph, only I don't know if you like cold pork legs in gelatin? Not only cold, madam. That's me, a hungry fellow. If only my ladies allow... another half a glass of liquor - it's sublime... And what is the bookkeeper like? - Mum will tell you everything... - But how do you like him? You have a very beautiful and smart daughter. Yes. If she would like to consider me as her suitor, please tell her that I have a nice salary and can earn something on the side, too. She would have everything with me. It isn't seemly for me to mention it myself. But Joseph, I don't need to praise you. You have already introduced yourself nicely. Please drink some more... Don't mind me because even one glass of the liquor is enough to make my blood pressure goes up and I can't sleep at all. Shush... - God! Are you OK? - Yes, I'm fine. But I've scared you, haven't I? Have I? I have! Idiot! Ladies, you look marvelous! I will cheer for you. Now get into the car because it's not that warm. It wasn't worth that much worrying, was it? You'll be the most beautiful in the entire parade. Not so fast, baby doll. What? What? You don't fancy us? What's in your little purse? Show us! Let the lady go or I will hurt you. Are you looking for trouble, you piece of shit? Pick it up and give it back to the lady. Say you're sorry! I'm sorry. Are you alright? Yes, sure. I just got upset. In that case I should walk you home. May I? But maybe you have somewhere you need to be... Never mind. Let's go. - What's your name, Ms? - Sabina. I am Bronislaw. I still have to thank you, Bronislaw. You were very brave. So... would you like to have tea with a brave citizen some day? Your prophecy came true. Grandma got sick. Grandma, what happened? She fainted first and, after she came to, she kept hearing falling down bombs for an hour or so, and then said that she wouldn't go to the basement. Maybe Arkady can put you in some clinic. No, no! I'm not going anywhere. There is the time for life and the time for death. And If you don't mind, I would like to die at home. And if I faint, don't revive me. Easy for you to say... So you peddle poetry to the Polish everyman? As the political officers say- you are spreading culture. I think it's always important. Of course. There is never too much culture. So, sir... what about you, what do you do? The war stopped me from studying in time, so now I study and work at a time. Don't ask me what I study because I am changing it for the third time. Somehow I can't find my way in life... - You are not the only one, I think. - So what, it's hard for me anyway. Sometimes I take it out on innocent people. In this case, maybe you would like some cake with your coffee? And it's my treat. I don't eat sweets. I haven't got used to them somehow. But, please, order something for yourself. And it's my treat. Poetry, can I help you? Yes, I'll tell her. Goodbye, sir. A man called and... ...he asked that you look out the window in one minute. He didn't introduce. He's handsome! How do you know him? I'll be right back. I'm sorry, I forgot to bring it to the cafÃ©. I hoped that when your coworkers saw at the parade how nice your figure is, somebody would get interested. Mum, you know well there are just a few men at my work, and most of them are married. Child, if I had my own drugstore, you would sit at the register - and somebody would have to notice you. - But you don't have one - because that scum robbed you. - Be quiet! Stop it! Is it that bad? Are we hungry? Arkady managed to get us this nice place... And do you know how others live nowadays? Marvelous place! And there is a ministry at your Grandpa's building now. And you know how it looked after the Uprising? At least they remodeled it. You taught me that one has to be careful in life. We need to worry about Sabina now because she will be alone when we are gone. Better alone than in bad company. - Could you stop worrying about me? - We can only stop talking about it. Good enough. Now that Grandma's sick, I am not going to have anybody over. Don't say that, Sabina. Don't you say that, dear child! Illness is a part of life. No reason to be so concerned. You are important now because you have a future. Invite whoever you want: I'll be more than happy with it. But first she has to have somebody to invite. Oh yes... And maybe I have such someone? Welcome. Am I mistaken or are you the first at work today? - I have a lot of work on that anthology. - Peasant poetry. Boring as hell, but important, believe me! What's up, boys? Everything under control? I report that under the best control, sir. Too bad we had to drop Wodzicki's poems but, as far as I know, we had no other choice. But keep your eyes on him, please. Let him feel our kindness. Maybe a summer camp for his kid or something... Think about it. The doctor told me to exercise and, for me, the stairs are the only opportunity to do it. See you soon. Sabina, my cheesecake recipe is in the French dictionary. If I die suddenly, you'll know where to look. Mum, why do you always have to say something sad? And why sad? What's sad about it? We'll all die one day. It may happen to everyone in the most unusual situation, in each moment. Mum, I would like you to meet Bronislaw. Bronek, this is my mum. - My pleasure. I'm Falski. - Irena Jankowska. Nice to meet you. Please accept this bouquet, madam. Thank you. Beautiful! I will put it in a vase right away. Falski? Is that author of a primer from your family? Regretfully, he isn't, madam. Sabina, invite our guest to the living room. My memory is good, but short and riddled with holes. - Can it be said so about memory? - Of course. - That's it riddled with holes like a sieve. I bought this at an antique bookstore and forgot to give it to you. I know I can't impress you with books but remember that at least I tried. Kochanowski? Published by Mortkowicz. You know, I've always wanted to have a copy of this? You are sweet and don't tell me you're ignorant; such coquettishness doesn't become you. I haven't been reading much because I had no time. Especially during the war. Did you stay in the city or join the guerrillas? Did you like it? Very good, but I don't want to look like I am attacking your food. Go ahead and attack it. Sabina, let me know if you need anything else. And offer your guest some liquor... Mum, I will get everything myself. Sure, Sabina. I won't bother you anymore. Excuse me... Can I sit next to you? Shush! Stop it, please. Do you need anything, something? And? Tell me! Yes, she is head over heels in love. I can tell that without even getting out of bed. But what is he like? One can consider him handsome. Handsome! Handsome... But what kind of man is he? One of the "modern" ones - or a regular person? - I don't know... You don't know... I should be there! Mum, calm down. Sit here or you'll ruin everything. Dear God! I'll return typescripts and be right back. But look after her, sir, so she won't get run over by a car. Oh, all right, all right! How is it? How much? Good. Quite good. Yes... Are you afraid you could scare me to death? If I checked my blood pressure then you would get terrified. Because your nerves are eating you up. Unnecessarily. The worst is already behind us. And WWIII most likely won't happen. Thank you, dear. And get that Bronislaw out of your head. Look at Sabina. She isn't crying, even though he didn't show up after the last time. - Can I listen to "Lucia di Lammermoor"? - Go ahead. Donizetti. I like him very much and I'll listen with pleasure, too. How come you are so stylish recently, Sabina? As if there was an official celebration everyday. Love makes her beautiful. And us... we haven't been in love for some time now. Can you talk about something else? Poetry, how can I help you? Just a moment... For you. There you go... Have you swallowed? And now try to lie down rest... I'll rest in my grave. Where are you going? I'm taking Sabina to the dentist because she's afraid to go alone. And she wanted to shoot in the Uprising... Mum, lie down. Try to fall asleep. You'll rest. - Bye, bye. - Bye, bye. And what do you need this vase for? I'm leaving. You'll have at least some time alone. Grandma's fed, and she'll sleep well. No, no. Not this blouse, no. The one from auntie Frania will be better. - This one? - Yes. You see? This one shows your neck. And you've got pretty neck. Well child, good luck. Oh! You're here, and I am just leaving. I won't be back sooner than in two hours. Good Morning. Let me help you. You must have been afraid I wouldn't come back. Why do you think so? Women always expect the worst. But I am different... a decent man, one could say, even with some plans. I can't see you very well. You're sitting so far from me. Try some cake. Mum baked it especially... - Perhaps I shouldn't mention that. - Cake has no legs, so it won't run away. But I have two and invite you to sit on my lap. Tell me better what you have been up to all this time... I have already told you. I had lots of deadlines. And my father got sick. My sister wrote he had strained his back. - Is he at the hospital? - He wouldn't go to the hospital. But he doesn't take care of himself and is always trying to carry something heavy, as if he's still young. He is resting a little and getting better. - Will you offer me the same as before? - Of course. Mum reminded me but I forgot. However I remember your favorite glass... In your hands! Don't put it away, because I may ask for more. It's yours. And where do your parents live? Why, are you with the cops? Kidding. Who but you, Sabina, has a right to know. I am from the Malopolska region, from the village of Pszczycow. It must be beautiful there. Godforsaken hole. But we had a good squire. He saw my potential and told me to learn and become a mechanic. The war interrupted that, but now I have to account for my studying... ...You don't want to sit on my lap, so I'll go on my knees to you. Can you pick up anything with this radio? Jazz? Radio "Free Europe" or something like that. Don't you know it's forbidden? Would you marry me? They were happy at work when I had told them about you. "Get married," they said. "We hold Ms. Sabina in high esteem. An educated person. It's nothing that her mother owned a drugstore before the war. It could have been worse." Where do you work? At the Party Committee? Details later, because I don't like to brag for no reason. I prefer you love the man in me first, and the professional later. Such a relationship lasts longer. But I must admit, I won't get permission to have a church wedding. Do you want to get married because you love me? Sure I do, and, as they say, at first sight. How about getting married this spring? The guests will have an easier time getting flowers. Frankly, I have an apartment promised in spring. I know you got a nice place, but we shouldn't be squeezed in here with others. So, my fair maid, will you marry Bronek? I see you want to think it over. Go ahead, talk to your mother, ask your granny, although she seems not all there anymore... - She is Grandma, not granny. - Forgive me. I am a simple boy, and we use a different language. Your life is tough, so are your words. But you will learn tenderness... Maybe I would make a good wife. Maybe? Sabina, you will be the best wife in the world. And we will have a boy first. We'll name him Joseph, after his grandfather. Too bad I am so behind with my work that I have no time to study. Maybe my fiancee could help me a little? - With what, if it's not a secret? - A secret? You always know the proper word. Of course, it's a secret, but as my woman you enjoy their total trust. That's why I was allowed to ask you for a favor. - But I'm not a Party member. - It's even better because one can see more, looking from the outside. They say I have a good eye. If you want, I can correct your papers. Linguistic accuracy is essential, because according to my director, we shouldn't poison people with bad language. He said so? Interesting. You are right again because I am talking about him. Sweet as a raspberry. And hot! The point is that I am not concerned about correcting someone's style. About what then? I don't know anything else. I don't want to hear that. My wife, only able to proofread? Why did you study before the war with Professor What's-his-name? I don't remember now... Didn't he urge you to express your opinion in writing? One needs talent for that and, most importantly, should have something to say. Everybody has talent, you just need some courage. With me you don't have to be afraid of anything. Did you write poems in your youth? You did. Are you surprised I know a bit about my beloved girl? Go ahead, it's your turn. Ask me anything. I can even bring my colleagues who will tell you about me. I didn't write poetry, but when you hear about some of my pranks, - you will burst with laughter. - So what I would have to do? Create a little poem. One page long, once a week. What your manager talks about, who calls him on the phone and who visits him. His name day is coming; see who from outside the firm brings him flowers. Watch his lovers, especially the married ones, with the VIP husbands. You don't like that accountant lady anyway. - Are you feeling alright, Bronek? - What? I can't ask my beloved to draw me a portrait of her supervisor? - Is that too complicated? - But what's the purpose of it all? I told you already - it will be a big help for me. And remember, your writing may be very important for that person. You will be doing him a favor if he turns out to be innocent. Maybe he is like - a child, who is not aware what he's doing? - If he turns out to be innocent? Do you even know who are you talking about? Next to my director, I am a reactionary. For now, unfortunately, and I am telling you this in complete confidence, he is a suspect. What can a man who fights for the people's education, - be suspected of? - Sabina, Sabina don't be so curious... Just between us, haven't you thought that with his zeal he might emphasize our ignorance? People know what's what and our enemies do not have to count our illiterates. I see I have convinced you. Maybe on Saturdays, after a movie, we'll sit down and I'll try to help you put something together? - I won't interfere after that... - I can't do it and I don't want to. It's not right to denounce on anybody, especially on somebody as innocent as - a lamb. I disagree, no way, I don't want to... - I beg you Sabina, don't get mad, there's no reason for that. Don't help me if you don't want to. But consider your arguments. Innocent as a lamb, sure, you can think so - but is it your heart's talk or your brain's? I can vouch for him as for myself! Heart it is. That's what I wanted to hear. I see that you're embarrassed. Good... 'cause how can you claim that someone is innocent... You know what I am talking about, don't you? We had a priest in our family but I have already reported it in my first questionnaire. And he died before the war. You're funny. Do you know, Sabina, what punishment you are facing for keeping gold? Particularly, that it can be proven as premeditated? Have you thought that your rectum would help you to deceive society? How do you... You can't possibly know about it. Did you think, poor girl, that if you swallow something and, excuse my language, take a shit, you will keep it a secret? I am ashamed for you... Mum has some rectified spirit somewhere. I'll bring it. Come and sit next to your hubby. Wait... Give it to me, your hands are shaking. Let's drink to our happy future! I can promise you one thing, Sabina. I'll do whatever I can to ensure we'll never return to this subject. What? Do I drink too much? Don't worry, my head's strong. The guys at work joke that I could compete with the Russians... I am sorry this is taking so long. I couldn't find anything better. The rest of your muscles will go limp soon and you'll stop breathing. You shouldn't feel any pain now. If we had had more of these in the Uprising, you would have become a good mechanic perhaps... What's happened? What has happened? Grandma? Mum, he was a government functionary. He blackmailed me. Wait... Calm down, Sabina. Calm down. That's their right, and you don't have to agree to anything. We will talk to Arkady; he knows a lot of people... Sabina, what's happened? Sabina... Oh dear God! Mum, I will kill myself now. You'll tell them, I went insane and poisoned him out of love. They won't do anything to you. And me... You know well that I have no future without a husband or kids. You kept saying it yourself. I have a poison. It will act very quickly, you want it? Be quiet, calm down. Don't be hysterical. Do you think I would let you die? When is Arkady coming back? On Tuesday. We have time. Go. Go to your grandma. Tell her you have a toothache and we are going to the dentist in a minute. Calm down, calm down! Wiktor, Wiktor... Maybe go and check the stairs... Jankowska with her daughter are dragging someone behind them upstairs. Go to sleep. Our Arkady went over the top. I can help you, ladies. I'll just put something on. Don't get out because they have just arrested the general. What was his last name? I forgot. Doesn't matter. Mum! Mum, mum! Arkady came back earlier, with some people. They're climbing the stairs because I blocked the elevator. - What should we do, mum? - Jesus... I don't know. Don't know. You smile, and... Help me. Gentlemen, please come inside. Arkady, it's so good that you're back. You have a terrible mess here. Some pipe got blocked just a moment ago and all the waste went up to the ceiling. Mum, you do recognize... I don't have to introduce my guests. Gentlemen, this is my mother and my sister. - Kind regards. - It's very nice to meet you. - Good Morning. Morning. - Good morning. All children in Poland - know you, gentlemen. - If only they would like us, too, madam... The time will come, Ziggy. Now that we have the artists on our side, everything will be better. We invited ourselves in to Arkady's to enjoy some art after those boring speeches. - They were boring, weren't they, Arkady? - How should I say this... Not when you were talking, Zygmunt. Such a joker... - Now, we invite you to a little snack. - But I would like to ask you... Maybe we should go downstairs, to my place, because the smell here... But let's stay here, it's nicer among the art objects. If you, madam, knew how many scents of pine trees and flowers we had smelled there. It almost made us wish for something truly foul. Fire please. Get something to eat and wait in the car. It may take a while. You didn't mention, Arkady, that you have such a charming sister. Where do you work, Miss, if you don't mind me asking? I am an editor at "Nowina" Publishing House I specialize in poetry. Huh! So culture and art, just like your brother. This is a very important area. Is this interest taken after you, Madam? No, no. It's rather after my husband, who played violin. And what kind of poetry do you like the most? Sabina likes Pushkin... True, a good choice. One could fall in love with that Russian. But don't be shy, girl. If you knew what books lie by my bed... I also like symbolists. - The Russian ones? - Them, too. These poets are not in style right now. But how about this... "Dear God! is not the life up there, Simple and sweet? How peacefully are borne up there Sounds of the street! What hast thou done, who comest here, To weep alway? Where hast thou laid, who comest here, Thy youth away?" Verlaine? Before the war, I studied in Paris... and saw the poverty of the Frenchmen. But it's different with poetry; they were rich in that sense. Arkady, my dear, are you going to fill our glasses yet? Of course, here you are. Maybe we will leave you now... No way, dear ladies. Please stay with us. Sabina, please convince your mum. But my daughter doesn't have to convince me at all. If it only pleases you... Oh yes, indeed. Arkady, I see you have a gramophone. Let's put something on and ask our ladies to dance. Oh, is that jazz? It's the music of those oppressed blacks. Yes, it's a sad story with those blacks. And can you dance to it anyway? Doesn't matter! Let's try! May I? But... But... I don't know how... Let's do it one-and-two. No compromises. I'm feeling some tango in it. Together with mum! Mrs Irena... Mum, what are my paintings doing here? Are you trying to poison them? They are already poisoned. Go back to your guests. Everything's fine. - But don't let them stay too long. - But what is fine? - Our existence depends on them. - Then it's even more important that they not stay too long. It's nothing. It's always like this when he drinks too much. He's been like this since he was a child. Arkadiusz... Music is here, it's good and it's beautiful... Look at him! And he was doing so well with the vodka. That's ambition. He wants to be like the other artists. But he just doesn't have the stomach for that, really. - Maybe we need a doctor? - No, no, . no. Please leave him alone. If he rests for a bit he will be fine. He has to stay in bed for a while. Sabina, please come to my office at the department. We will try to move you up the ladder of culture implementation. And I will make sure my friend keeps his word. Once more, thank you for everything. ...she wanted to kill herself. That's why I dissolved the bastard. I know you would do the same in my place. Me or you? Me. Let me, Sabina. Nobody will notice me. Nobody notices me either. And I am the one who should bury him. Let's go. Mum? Mum, where are you? Why did you get up? You could have fallen and gotten hurt. How long can one stay in bed? You keep coming and going like busy bees... I'll bring some liquor. Wait! I want to tell you something. Sit down. Surely you don't know what to do with the bones. I've been thinking about it for a long time and found a great solution. - Mum, what are you talking about? - Do you think I am completely brainless? You were stinking as skunks for three days and were never at home... That was my fault, Grandma. He was a bad man and wanted to hurt you. He looked into my room. I know a lot about people... That's why I couldn't fall asleep, despite your bromides, Irena. Anyway, I'll tell you what you should do with his bones. I will die soon. Then you'll put those bones into my coffin. No harm for me and God will forgive. Marvelous idea! I need to confess to one more thing. I didn't turn in Grandma's coin like I told you. Leave it. In 3 years from now the most beautiful edifice of Warsaw will rise in the heart of the city. First construction works have begun. Mum, Just because one is going to a better world, does not mean that - one is justified in saying rubbish. - Then I'll be short: if you get rid of the child, you will be making the biggest mistake of your life. - But Grandma, I didn't love that man! - And what does it mean: didn't love? One loves passionately for one, two years - I don't know - and after that there is ordinary life... I think the same, Sabina. Maybe that peasant's son was fighting against Hitler? Who knows, maybe the Secret Police had threatened to kill his family? - I can't listen to this, mum. - You don't have to. But a child is a child. Can support you when you are old. I don't ask who the lucky man is. And let me just say that if I were younger I would be jealous. And you have blossomed, Sabina. Thank you, sir director. He likes you a lot. Look after everything here, boys. And you, Ms. Zofia, please remember about our publishing plan. We can't mess it up. And you will go with us. - Why? It must be some mistake. - If so, you will be home in two hours. Did he ask for him? They are looking everywhere. He even showed me a photo. And what did you say? I asked what wrong such a handsome man could have done. Good. Don't tell Sabina because the baby will get upset. His name was Toporek. On the Fifth of March 9:50 p.m. the heart of Josef Stalin stopped. This tragic news covered the entire human race with heavy mourning. In a tough moment such as this we feel, deeper than ever, the invincible power and togetherness of the World Peace Camp, to which the inspiration was, is, and will be - Josef Stalin. Sonny, I am such a scatterbrain. I knew you would come, mum. And this is Jason. He wanted to meet you so much that I had to take him with me. Welcome, Madame, very much. Good afternoon. Let Jason sit in front, he will see better. No way. I want to have you by my side all the time. He won't bother. You see... He says you are our treasure. Tell him he smiles beautifully... And how did dad smile? He was always serious, as if he could foresee his arrest. And I never saw him after that. But you have his smile. Wait a second, Marek. Here? I've been helping out this one woman here. And most of all at the All Souls Feast. Shall I go with you? It's so empty there. Wait... I'll be right back. She never forgets about her. And where is that beggar... that woman? I don't know, by the Palace, probably...
