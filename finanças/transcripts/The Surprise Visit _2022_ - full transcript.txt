Aah! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That mean what I think it means? Ha, ha! We fixin' to be parents! Yeah! Hey. Hey, what's wrong, baby? What's wrong? Nothin'. I'm... I'm not good enough to be a mom. I'm doin' too many drugs. No, no, no, no. You'll be fine. You'll be fine, baby. You're gonna be such a good mother. - You think so? - Oh, I know so. I hope so. You're gonna be such a good dad. Yeah, you're gonna love it, honey. But we gotta stop doing... using, okay? No more... no more using. Babies come out real hurt. Yeah, yeah, no. Sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just gonna... I'm gonna... I want to give our baby everything in the world, whatever they want, you know... a-a Big Wheel, a pony, right? I don't want them... I don't want them to want for nothin', you know? Wait. How are we gonna pay for a baby? We can't even pay our phone bill. We can't even buy food. Uh, hey, I'll get a job. Who's gonna hire you right now? No one's hiring in the COVID. Hey, just don't think like that, okay? Belle, I'm gonna take care of you, okay? You know that, right? Hmm? You trust me? You ain't got no money, Casey. - No, no, no, shh. - Maybe I should just... No, no, no, no! No. I can do this, okay? I will do this. Don't you worry, okay? It's what I have always wanted, Belle. Now, let me just... let me figure... let me figure this out, okay? Just... No, Casey! We can't do that no more. You're gonna be a daddy. You gotta get in the straight and narrow, okay? No more drugs. Casey. Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Belle. You're right, Belle. We gotta get on the straight and narrow. That's what we'll do. That's what we'll do. And you'll get a job? Yeah. Yeah, I promise. Yeah. I'll get a job. I-I'm gonna talk to my dad, see if he'll maybe... maybe he'll give me some money, maybe he'll give me a job. I think he will. Yeah. He needs the help. And... And the lady he works for, she got a lot of money, but she don't pay much. - Jobs, jobs. - Exactly, exactly, yeah. I think, yeah, that should work. It'll work, right? I don't know. You think it'll work? Yeah, yeah, I do. I do. Don't worry, baby. You can count on me. All right? Okay? Count on me. I'll do anything for you. All right? You scared me! You okay? No, I'm running late. You're still going? Yeah, I have to speak to my mom, and we have those estate papers to sign, and then she keeps asking me if there's anything of my dad's I want. I should come out and get it, and... I can't believe I'm never gonna get to speak to him again. Why don't I come with you? What about that big presentation? I can push it. All right? Being with you right now... that's what's important. Yay! Oh, I was hoping you'd ask. - I know. - Thank you. Well, don't think me yet. You know how your mother and I can get. No discussing politics. We're in D.C. What do you mean? Politics, come on. No poking the bear. Fine. I'm gonna get changed, and I'll throw some things in the bag, okay? Okay. You gonna tell her we're coming? - No, I want to surprise her. - Why would you surprise her? My mother loves surprises. - No, she doesn't. - Yes, she does. Okay. All right. Hey, Mama. I know I can't bring you back, but... I plan to make you proud. I'm gonna be a daddy. And I'm gonna give her the best life. Things will change. Life will be better. I promise. I love you, Mama. Hey, Dad. How you been? What'd I tell you about comin' around here? I wanted to see you. I can't lend you any more money, son. I'm sorry. Just a few dollars? Please? Dad, come on. I-I ain't got no one else to go to. Can you at least get me a job? Mrs. Dixon would never hire you, and the shape you're in, I... I can't say I'd ask her to. Why? What are you talkin' about? Son, you need help. I'm fine, Dad. I just need some money and a job, just money and a job, can... Some money and a job, Dad. Come on, please? Can't you help me, please? Please? - I can't. - Please. - I won't. - I'm desperate, Dad! I told you the last time, it was the last time. - What am I supposed to do?! - Get cleaned up! I don't know what you're talkin' about. Not my problem! I'm hungry. Belle and I don't got no money for food. Oh, man. How is Annabelle? She's pregnant. You're fixin' to be a grandpa. - Oh, man. - That's... That's... That's why I need money. Okay, I want to be a good dad. I-I will be. I want to get better. I-I don't want my kid to look at me like this, look at me like you do. You get clean, I'll be happy to ask Mrs. Dixon about a job for you, but until then, the answer's gonna be no. Whatever. Screw you. You're just a gardener. Thank God your mother isn't alive to see you like this. Why'd you have to say that, huh? Why would you say that, Dad? - Son, calm down. - What's wrong with you? Why would you say that to me, huh? Huh? Why would you say that to me? What's wrong with you? II'm sorry! You know I was with Mom when she died. I was taking care of her! Where were you? I was the one who took care of her. - Calm down. - Where were you? Looking for the bottom of a bottle. The hell you say. The hell you say. Why would you kick me when I'm down, Dad? I'm your son, Dad. No, you're not. You are my embarrassment. I have to get back to work. Please get some help. I'm sorry, son. Screw you! Hey, Hugh. I'm about ready to go to the airport. I'm on the way. She never uses that cane like I tell her to. Can't believe she slipped and fell in her own house. - Is she okay? - Yes, she's fine, but I'll have to go stay with her for a few days. To be honest, it feels like I haven't seen anyone since all the COVID nonsense, so I'm kind of looking forward to it. By the way, was that Casey? Uh, yes, ma'am, it was. He knows he's not supposed to come around here. I told him that. No need to apologize, Hugh. How's he doing? Well, when his mama died, he went off the rails. You know, she meant the world to him, and, you know, when she wasn't there for him, I don't know, he just went nuts, and I didn't know how to be there for him. And him being the spitting image of his mama, well... it just kills me to see him, especially when he's... Anyway, you probably need to get on the road. Mrs. Dixon, I need to ask you something. Could you see your way to maybe hiring my kid, like, giving him a job, hiring him? I'm sorry. I don't want to put you on the spot. You know, maybe a little hard work is just what your boy needs. I'd be happy to hire Casey, on a trial basis, of course. Ah, you'd do that, ma'am? Thank you so much. Oh, my goodness. I mean, I can't guarantee anything, but I can say that, you know, deep down inside, he's a really good kid. I know. I-I trust your judgment, Hugh. You bring Casey on as you see fit, but it's up to him to make the best of it, you know. - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much. So I'll see you Monday. I'll be back Monday. - Okay. - See you then. Thank you, ma'am. Drive careful. - Okay, I will. - All right. ♪ I'm gonna make a baby ♪ ♪ They always call me crazy ♪ ♪ But I never make a sound ♪ ♪ I never know the times ♪ Belle? Belle, I got an idea. What? You get a job? - No, no. - Huh? Well, did he say he'd get you a job? - No. - Hey, you scored. - Yeah. - You said you'd stop using. Listen, baby, I promise I'll stop using, but I-I got an idea, okay? What is it? What's that? We rob that old lady. What? What are you talkin' about? Just that old lady my dad works for. She's so rich. What do you think? I think you're crazy. No, no, no, it ain't crazy, baby. We'd be set, all right? She's got so much jewelry, she wouldn't even notice. Just one necklace, one ring... change our life. All right? Our baby never want for nothin'. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. She... She'd grow up like a princess. The world would be her oyster. Yeah, she'd never suffer like we suffered. Huh? How you know this? Everyone in town knows about Mrs. Dixon. You ain't never heard of her? No. She's always walking around dressed to the nines, wearing some big, fancy jewels. Is she rich like Dolly Parton? - Yeah, just like Dolly, baby. - Mm. What do you think? Huh? I don't know. We ain't no thieves. Listen, this is our chance, okay, to get the hell out of here, all right? People like us... we don't get the opportunity to do that, but this one's ours. We gotta take it, okay? You really think we could do it? Oh, 100%. She just left town for few days. Ain't no one there. - What about your daddy? - Ah, he... he ain't got no business there in the middle of the night. - Hmm. - Come on, it'll be so easy. What do you think, huh? You trust me? - I think you're crazy. - Yeah, but do you trust me? Huh? Do you? 'Cause I need you to trust me. I trust you. I'd do anything for you, baby. Anything. Surprise! Mom? It's me. Mom, you here? I wonder where she is. Mom, you out here? Where is she? Huh. Hmm. I wonder where she is. Maybe she's out running errands. Huh. Hey, Juliette! Hugh! Sorry to startle you. I didn't know you were comin'. Well, we wanted to surprise Mom. Do you know where she is? Yes. Unfortunately, your Aunt Kathy slipped and fell at her house, and your mom went to stay with her until your cousin could get there. I-Is she okay? - I think so, yeah. - Okay. Well, I'll leave you two be. I'm just checkin' on stuff. Okay. Hugh, thank you for taking such wonderful care of my mom. Of course. If you need anything, I'll be over in the mill for a few hours, okay? Okay. Good seeing you. You, too. Well, I guess it's just you and me. We got the place to ourselves. Let's open a bottle of wine. Yeah. Yeah! We'll wait a few hours. Ain't no one awake at 4:00 a.m. Oh, yeah, that's smart. That's real smart. I'm telling you, Belle, startin' tomorrow, it's a whole new life. Water's always warm. We're gonna teach our kid how to swim. Hmm. It'll be margaritas and sunsets. - Ah, sounds like heaven. - Don't it? How nice would it be to wake up by the beach, and you... you hear waves, and you... shhhhhhhh... - Yeah. - ...shhhhhhhhh. - Shhhhhhhhhhh. - Shhhhhhhhhhh. Yeah. Well, just think... next week, we'll be sittin' on the beach. Mm. I'm already there. God, I love you. Love you, too. Would have loved to have grown up here. It was magical. Um, we used to, uh, swim in the pond and play hide-and-seek in the forest. Hide-and-seek? Did anybody find anyone? It's huge. Well, games lasted a very long time, but I usually won. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. - Mm. Miss Princess... - Mm-hmm. - ...in the woods. - Hey, you. Daddy even taught this little princess how to hunt and fish in those woods. I loved him so much. To your dad. You ready for this? You sure they ain't home? Yeah, I'm sure, baby. It's fine. If the crick don't rise, it ain't gonna rise. In and out, easy-peasy. Just grab a few pieces of jewelry and skedaddle. Sound good? - Easy-peasy. - Yeah. I'm just scared. Hey, don't be, okay? Just keep thinking, "Mexico, here we come. Mexico, here we come." Okay? Mexico, here we come. Just keep thinking that, okay, baby? - Okay. - All right. You ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. Okay. I ain't never done something like this. Just relax. Wow. This place is huge! Think... it's just their country home. What if they got one of those alarms? Fancy places like this always got one of them alarms. They ain't got no alarm. Why? Never needed one. Everyone in town knows this place used to host fox hunts. Place is stocked up more than an armory. Everyone's too afraid to get shot up. You mean they kill all the baby foxes? Oh, I know, baby. Ain't that messed up? Hey, don't worry. No one's home, all right? Let's go. Hey, she left the lights on. You know... you know, she might be home. Nah, rich people always leave their lights on, Belle. I know she's not here. Shh. Oh, no. I'm just kidding. That's not funny, Casey. What was that? Wake... Wake up. I heard something. What? I heard glass breaking downstairs. - Are you sure? - Yes. Wow. These people are rich. Told you. Did you hear that? Hear what? I swear to God, I think I heard something. Maybe your mother came home. My mother came home and broke a window? Okay, wait... wait here. Wait here. - See? I told you. - Okay, wait here. - There's someone down there. - Where are you going? Just wait here. This place is like a maze. Look at this, Belle. This here is Dandy-Q. - Wow. - Yeah. I'll bet there's a safe in this room. Shh! What was that? Did you hear that? Call 911. I don't have any reception. - You're freaking me out. - 'Cause I'm freaked out. Are there any guns in the house? They're all in the hunting cabinet. Somethin' don't feel right. C-Can we please just get the jewelry and go? Somethin' don't feel right. Can we please get the jewelry and just go? Fine. Did you hear that? There's definitely someone in the house. That ain't gonna be in here. Let's go. Any signal? There's... There's a landline in the office. Okay. Shh. - Hey! - Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! What the hell are you doing in here?! - No, no, no, no! - You little bastard! - No! Oh, God. - Stop! - I'm sorry! - Calm down! - I'm sorry. - Stop it! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Hey! Daniel? Are you okay? Are you okay? What? Daniel? Are you okay? What? Daniel? Um... Daniel? Daniel? Daniel? Wake up. Wake up, Daniel. Daniel? - Come on, man. - Daniel. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Daniel! - Wake up, please, please. - Oh, wake up. - Please, please, no. - Wake up. Get away from him! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I ju... I just... Daniel, Daniel, wake up. Daniel, wake up. Wake up. Wake up, Daniel. You can't go. I didn't mean to. It was an accident. - You idiot. - I'm sorry. I didn't... Daniel. Is he breathing? Daniel, oh, my God. No! - I'm sorry. - No! No! We... We need to call an am-ambulance. We need to call... No. What are you doing? - I'm calling an ambulance. - No! No! - What are you doing?! - Give me that. - What are you doing?! - No! Wh-Why did you do that? He needs help. Just... Just tell us where the jewelry is, and we'll go. What... What are you talking about? What jewelry? W-Where's the jewelry? Says a girl who comes from money. No. Come on, Casey. Let's just go. Ca... Casey? I-I knew you when you were little. She knows who we are, Casey. What are we gonna do? No, Casey. No, no. No, Casey. No. No, Casey. No, no. No! No, no. I told you I didn't mean it. Please. Aah! She knows what happened. She's for sure to tell the cops. I knew it. I knew we shouldn't have done this. Yeah, but we did, Belle. We did. There's no changing it. So what are we gonna do? I don't know. I don't know. Hey, uh, I know I can't let her tell the cops. I can't do that. I can't go to prison. I won't. There's gotta be a way out of this. Think, Casey. Maybe we just go to Mexico. We keep her tied up and so she don't tell a soul. No! My dad will find her before we even cross the state border, okay? - So what we gonna do? - I don't know. I don't know. Just... What do you mean, you don't know, Casey? You said this was easy-peasy. You said we were gonna go to Mexico. What happened to Mexico, huh? None of that happens, though, baby, if she tells the police. Now, please, just give me a minute to figure this out. I just need a minute. Maybe she won't tell the police. Maybe we let her go. She won't say nothing. She's for sure gonna tell the police, okay? I done killed her husband. I know that. - Please just let me go. - Shut up! It was an accident, right? I won't tell anyone. That's what you said. It was an accident. You didn't mean it, right? Right? I just want to go to Mexico. The margaritas and the sunsets, you remember? Margaritas and sunsets. Baby, baby, there's only way to guarantee she won't tell the police. - What's that? - Just one way. What? What are you saying? I'm saying we can't raise no kid from prison. - You're not saying that. - Yeah. You know what this is. No, Casey. - Yes. - I don't think you're thinkin' right. Yes, I am. - No, Casey. - It's the only way we can do it. - No. - Yes. - Casey, no. - Now we have to, okay? Casey, that was not part of the plan! I don't want to, but... Shh! We have to do this for our kid, okay? - I don't want a kid no more. - Then what? You think I want to kill someone? - No. - We don't have a choice! - No. - God, I wish you would get... Please, please, Casey, please listen to me just this once, please, Casey, please, just this once. Please just listen to me, please! Okay, I'm doing this for us, all right? You gotta trust me. I'm only doing this 'cause I love you, and I love her. I love our baby, right? Okay, look at me. You gotta trust me. All right? All right? You gotta trust me on this, okay? Okay. Trust me. Okay, good. All right, baby. Ah. - How are you gonna do it? - I don't know. You know, I'm gonna find the jewels first. All right? Take this. Make sure she don't leave, okay? Watch her. I can't raise a baby on my own. I-I need him. T-The baby need a daddy. You're pregnant, and you're robbing my mom's home? We're doin' this so we can make a life together. You're never make a life with him. How can you? Look at him. Look at what he's doing. I know you don't want to do this. You don't have to. Just stop talkin'. Please don't do this. Mind your own business, lady. - Please! - Just stop talkin', okay?! You don't... You don't get it. We... It's already happening. He done made up his mind. He's manipulating you. Don't you see that? You have to think about yourself and your future child. - I am. - But you're not! Please don't do this. You can still get out. How? Just let me go. Can't. Can't do that. You can still say my... my husband's death was... was an accident, but you'll never get away with murder. You'll never get out of prison. We ain't goin' to prison, lady. We goin' to Mexico. You will if you do this. And your kid will never see you, ever. Listen to me. I'm a lawyer. I've seen hundreds of cases like this. A jury will never convict you. They will know whose idea this was. No. No. I wouldn't never turn on him. You don't have to. They will know it was his idea. What you mean? You ever been arrested? No. Then you'll get off with a slap on the wrist. But if you kill me, then your life is over. Are you ready for that? Are you? Ugh. It's obvious you don't want to do this. You have to think about yourself and your child. He never will. What kind of man takes his pregnant girlfriend to rob a house? Is that someone you really want to raise a child with? Ugh. Ugh! Ugh! It's perfect. Belle! I told you, we hit the jackpot. Oh, my God! You found it! There's got to be at least $7,000 maybe even $10,000 worth of jewelry here. Oh, my God. Holy moly. Now, wait. - Oh, wow. - Hold on one second. Hold on one second. Oh, my God! - Annabelle Marie Downey... - What? ...I loved you ever since I saw you picking out your cotton candy at the state fair. Will you make the happiest man in Loudon County and marry me? Yeah. Yeah, I will. I love you. Oh, my God! I'm so excited. We gonna have the best life together. We just gotta take care of one more thing. Just wait one second. Maybe talk, and then... We gotta kill her. No, Casey. I-I can't. She won't tell nobody. - She will. - I won't. I won't. I won't. See? She won't, okay? She's not gonna tell nobody. She will, Belle. - Casey. - Give me that fire poker. - Casey. - No, no, no, no. Casey, you listen to me. You listen to me right now. Belle, shh. - No, no. - Casey, wait. She's a smart lady. We used to play together. I-I know your father. Please, please. - Casey. - Please, God, no. - She's a real smart lady. - Belle, Belle. I need you to be quiet, okay? You listen to me right... - Shh. - Please. We can do something else, I promise. - Please, no. - Belle. - Please, no. - Listen, Casey. This ain't you, Casey. Casey, you know this ain't you. I'm not gonna let you do it, Casey! Would you please just shut up?! And I need to take care of this, okay? No, no, no, no. Casey, if you just... what the heck, Casey?! It's the only way to get better now. - Please, no. - Casey! Oh, my God! No! - You need to shut up! - No! - Ahhhhhh! - Please! I can't breathe. I need some air. You watch her. I-I gotta get some air. Okay. Okay, lady. Y-You stay here. Casey, what are you doin'? Casey. Casey, what are you doin'? Nothing, nothing, baby. Nothing. What's wrong? Casey, listen... I just needed some air. Casey, I know you don't want to do it, and you don't have to. Belle, I don't know what else to do. But you know I'm doing this for us, right? You know that, right? I ain't no murderer. I'm just tryin' to give us a better life. And we're this close. You get that, right? Tell me you understand that. I need you to understand. Okay? I do. I love you so much. But I gotta do this. God, you're pretty. I can't lose you. You hear that? What? Here. Close your eyes. Close 'em. Come on. Just do it. You hear that sound? The waves crashing on the beach. Hmm? I want you to picture it down there. Salt in the air. Sun shinin' on your face. Toes in the sand. No more shoes. Margaritas and sunsets. Hmm? Margaritas and sunsets. I'd do anything for you. I hope you know that. I do. Okay. Then you know what has to be done. All right. Why don't you go check on her, okay? - Okay. - I need... I need to psych myself up. Probably best if I do that a little. - You okay? - Yeah. - Are you comin' back? - Yeah, I'm comin' back, baby. I'll just be a minute, okay? Hey, lady, what are you doin'?! You're gonna get us in trouble. I won't. I promise. I ain't know how to make him stop, okay? I ain't know how. Listen to me. You're a nice girl. Y-You don't want to go to prison over this. You're too young. You're too pretty. Shut up, lady! You ain't know me! We ain't goin' to prison, 'kay? We... We're gonna go to Mexico. With what money? The jewelry isn't real. What do you mean? My mother would never spend money on... on real jewelry. It's fake. You're lyin'. I'm not. Look at it. It's costume jewelry. You can tell, can't you? Look at it. You really want to go to prison over costume jewelry? How do I trust you? Do you really want to ruin your life over this? Look, you're... you're a nice girl. You don't want to do this. You don't want to throw your life away. Trust me. You have a family, don't you? A mom, a dad? Think about it. Think about them, huh? Your baby... you have a baby on the way. You can't do this to your baby. Yeah! Ah! Yeah! You got this. You got this. You got this. Come on. Come on. Come on! Yeah! Ah. Where is she? I-I'm sorry. Where the hell is she, Belle, huh? She said it's fake. What's fake? The jewelry. Fake? What?! You think anything in that mansion looks fake, huh? No. It's real. It's very real. Look at that... shimmery, shiny. Look at that. She said just for costume. Costume?! Stop laughin' at me! - Why are you laughin' at me? - What?! - Stop laughin' at me! - Don't you... She's a witness, Belle. You can't let her get away. God! - No! - What? You don't... you're so stupid. If I'm so stupid, then why you gonna marry me, huh? I don't want it. No, no. - I don't want it! - Belle, Belle, Belle. - I don't want it! - No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. No, no. I shouldn't have said that, okay? All right? I'm sorry. I apologize, okay? We all make mistakes, okay? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have reacted that way, all right? Now, we gotta find her. She's a witness, okay? She could get us in a lot of trouble. We could go to prison, okay? - Okay. - All right? So l-let's get some of these jewels. Come on. Come on. We have to find her, Belle. Come on. All right. Hurry. All right. Now we gotta find her. Come on. Let's go! Come on. Shit! Shit. We lost her! I knew we shouldn't have done this. Why did you have to let her go? What was I thinking? We're gonna have a baby, hmm? Belle, I screwed up, okay? I didn't mean to kill that man, but I did, okay? But we have to do this now. You gotta pull it together. How we gonna find her? We just gotta think like her, okay? She'd try and cut through the woods, right, to get to a main road. Aaaah! Belle, there! There she is. Come on. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Come on. - I heard something. - Yeah, where? - Just that way. - This way? There she is! I think she went in. She's gotta be in here. - How do you know? - Where else would she go? Now, you take this.

Casey? Where is she? Here, you're bleedin' real bad. There she is! Oh, God. Come on. Come on, Belle, pick it up. Come on. I hear her. - Where? - She's coming from that way. Well, let's go. Come on!

Let's just go home. No, Belle, just shut up, okay? Don't talk to me like that! This on you, Belle, you. All right? We could've been out of the state by now if you hadn't of let her go. Hey.
