Amazing! That's how guests will slide into new year's carnival! - Hi, auntie Dusya! - I liked the rehearsal. Well done! - Costumes from the theatre? - Just delivered. Hi, girls! Don't forget the ballet rehearsal at one. - Hi, Grisha. - How'd you know it was me? - Intuition. - Well, hi then. I've been meaning... to congratulate you. - What for? - For the natural disaster. The new director. The director's on a business trip. Ogurtsov has taken over. No way. Lena, I've been wanting to ask... about having a serious talk? I've got to go to a meeting. An objective enough reason. - Oh, c'mon Lena... - Grisha... You know, I've got a solution - a certain helper. Modern technology. - I don't understand. - You will when you hear it. Hello! - Have you made the sketches? - Here they are. Come in, comrades. Come in, comrades. Have a seat. You know comrade Telegin? A leader in the trade union, city council deputy, and on New Year's... Like this? Why should soviet citizens hide their faces? Why, comrades? It's not normal. But let's move on to the real matter. Comrades, we need to make this a happy New Year's eve. There're certain orders and demands from above, if you will. We need to conduct this undertaking... In a way that we can't be accused of anything. We need to include some fantastic fun, on budget, but we also need to... ...conduct this undertaking... at the highest level. It's important you understand this, don't you think, comrade Krylova? Putting together a good carnival's no joke. Don't worry, comrade, I don't joke about things at all. - Keep writing. - Yes, Serafim Ivanych, I will. I've been thinking about this, and our New Year's eve should start like this. On stage... Write it down! As per Russian fairy tales, - there's a fairy-tale tower. - 3 cubic meters of saw wood. Later, Fedor Petrovich. The bells ring and out comes... Who? - A bear. - No. - Santa Claus? A snow maiden? - No. Out comes a lecturer. A lecturer? And he gives a short speech, 40 minutes or so. What do you think, Comrade Romashkina? Yes, it's serious and it motivates... Precisely. This puts us in a tight spot, Serafim Ivanych. Comrade Krylova has planned: Santa Claus one, snowflakes 30 units, as well as puss in boots and a wicked witch. No cats in the budget. - No money for boots. - What do you propose? - Cut back. - Who? - The cat. - Right. At minimum, no cat. And as for the wicked witch, nothing for her either. We'll stay... - ...in-house for that one. - We'll try. Very original, Serafim Ivanych. You could say the grey matter in his brain worked hard. I'm not only grey, comrade Usikov. That's all, comrades. It's comrade Telegin. Yes, comrade Telegin... And your wife for New Year's? Of course. Comrades, Serafim Ivanych wants to review all the acts in an hour. In a spring so fine A girl met a guy He was handsome and shy Followed her around And stared with lovesick eyes But never knew what to say I don't know how to begin Or even what I mean It didn't work out once again. He doesn't know how to begin Or even what he means It didn't work out once again. You can ask me to explain Don't be sad in vain. You won't understand a thing. Your glances are so sweet. You don't to speak. There's just three words you need to sing... - I don't know... - How to begin? Or even, well... It didn't work out once again. If his glances are so sweet He doesn't need to speak... There's just three words he needs to sing. I love you! Nothing wrong with that number. - They sing well, I liked it. - It was good. Lena, come here. The unfamiliar guy comes up to me and says 'You know who I am?' I say 'I do', and he says 'Give this envelope to Lena.' So did this unfamiliar-stranger say anything else? Sighed and left. Kostya, can I put on this record? Of course. Dear Lena, now you'll listen to me. The thing is like this... All you see is this record, but I see you, your face, your eyes. Lena, there comes a time in everyone's life when you have to explain yourself to another. Kostya! You can make this quieter? Silly that I have to rely on technical support but it's easier. If you interrupt me, Lena, I'll be quiet. But not on a record. Of course you can break it, but I hope you won't. Lena, I've been wanting to tell you this for a long time. I love you! I do! I do! I love you! I love you! I'm not afraid to say it! That's Shakespeare, but which play? I thought for a long time before recording this. You might think it's a joke, Lena. But in every joke there's a grain of truth, and... Ok, that was great, well done. Why'd you turn it off? What for? The whole place is already in the know. - What? - It was a public broadcast! Grisha, I give you my word it was an accident! Yeah, it's funny to broadcast another's feelings on the pa... So that's how you respond? What should I say? Nothing to say? Once again. You're so shy, indecisive. - I'm what? - Shy, Indecisive. Am I wrong, Grisha? So, Lena, it's like, you know, I told you... - Is that all? - Yes. Well spoken. What happened to the Shakespeare program? Technical difficulties. Tosya, let's go over our objectives! Tosya, we'll need about five janitors. Will do, Serafim Ivanych. The decoration's good, though, right? Not bad, but the supports aren't decorated. Too bad they didn't use 'Bears on Holiday.' That would be too... That's right, Serafim Ivanych. You do understand what you're doing? - I don't follow you. - Exactly. Are we at the beach here? What's going on here? - What? My legs. - Yes. - Where do you usually work? - I'm an economist. Really? You don't meet them like this every day. Naked legs aren't going to educate our audience. It's like this. Change the costumes. Cover the legs. About the dance... - What's the dance about? - About youth, love. I'm married, I understand. This is your version - young man in love must throw his girlfriend around? It's modern dance, - the nature of dance. - Comrade Krylova! You understand we're not spending money on education to throw economists around that way. - It's the choreography! - Imagine. Let's go, Tosya. Three wise old men of gotham Went to sea in a bowl Brr-brr! Bam-bam! If their bowl had been stronger If their bowl had been stronger Our song would be longer... Not bad. You should increase the number of singers. We've got plenty in house. - But this is a quartet. - What's a quartet with a few more people? A mass-quartet. And what's this? - Orchestral rehearsal. - Wonderful. Stop! You got off to a bad start, the horns were late. Sasha, I've told you again and again that it's not b but b-flat! One more time! What can I say? A big ensemble of qualified people, a lot of work, but I have no doubt that this won't do at all. - What? - The music just doesn't make you feel, and it has to make you feel. - Sorry, I don't understand. - The music has to, you know, grab you without carrying you away, understand? You're just playing dum-da-dum on the trumpet. Pick a more serious repertoire. - There are two days to New Year's. - The program's set! - We've rehearsed so much! - We won't change the program. What? This orchestra will not perform. - But why? - Undisciplined. Pick a new group of young people. In the stage veterans home there's an amateur orchestra, serious people. Pensioners, you know, have a... Serious attitude to art. Make an agreement with them about a cultural exchange, - us - them, them - us. - But... That's all, Elena Ivanovna. The work day's over. Time for bye-byes! At your suggestion I've re-read Turgenev's 'Spring waters.' A wonderful work. Three days now of love! Real emotion! Poetry! All this commotion about the New Year's, and, sinner that I am, love only quiet. It's nice and quiet in your office. You don't say. Coping with young people. A crush all day. Sign here, pay this, rush, rush, rush. I'm a calm person, a widower. You understand me, Adelaida Kuzminichna, I'm relaxed in your company, you're a serious person. It's my age, Fyodor Petrovich, it's time to be serious. I haven't been twenty-five in a long time. And I have to say, I'm no longer thirty-eight. Play something and I'll be off. What should I play? A bright moon in the sky With tender beauty shines And I am alone... Completely alone with hope I dream. Singing, or as they say, culturally relaxing? Not bad, comrades. Doesn't Adeleaida Kuzminichna have a very pleasant voice? Indeed. It'd be good if you, Adeleaida Kuzminichna, were to perform, rather, to shine, at the New Year's concert. What do you mean, Serafim Ivanych, sing what? - This number you were singing. - Excellent idea! By the way, it would be good for you to appear as well. Read some poetry or something. The last time I performed wasn't long ago. About forty years. I read a fable at school. Well then. A fable's good, it's satire. We need our Gogols and Shchedrins. Read a fable. And you, Adeleaida Kuzminichna, you can perform your song. What was it? 'I'm alone, completely alone?' 'With quiet hope I dream.' Good, very good. Only I'd clarify the formulation. I don't understand. You see, singing: 'Alone, completely alone in such a great collective.' Will be typical. I can't take it any more! Not the right stars, the moon smiles, the curtain's wrong. - The orchestra won't do. - He only likes the tower. - Any suggestions? - Let him design himself, - act himself... - Dance himself. Sing himself. A joke's a joke, but we have to do something. We should all get together and go to Telegin. That won't work. What are we, kids? Let's go 'Tell on him'? We need to find a solution ourselves. Let's agree with him about everything. We'll say everything's great and have our own way. - Right. - And then he will see. Hang on, what are we going to do about the orchestra? - Yes, what about it? - How do you do. Forgive me if I've disturbed you. I'm from the stage veterans home. Comrade Ogurtsov called us about the orchestra. You'll find Ogurtsov in the second door. Ogurtsov? Well, thanks very much. I was afraid I'd have to talk to that, what's her name? - Frolova, isn't it? - Maybe Krylova? - That's the one. - Why? They say she's a cold, indifferent person. Who told you that? Ogurtsov? Maybe you'll tell me. My name's Krylova. Oh, this turned out bad. I'm sorry. Stop, please, who said this? I'll only tell you. I'll go have a smoke. I'm really sorry. Comrade Krylova, I'm Grisha Koltsov's grandfather. - He's the one who said this to you? - No. He loves you. Doesn't sleep at night, thinks only of you. He's a good kid, if he falls in love, it's forever. Why do you torment him so? Oh, grandfather! - I'm off to comrade Ogurtsov. - Wait, grandfather! I'm in a rush! What's wrong, grandfather! Wait! Did you see the old man running by? - He flew by like a jet plane. - Where? - This way then that way. - What's up? - Did you see your grandpa here? - My grandpa? - His grandpa? - So I've got a grandpa. Look at his boots. I see them. - The same? - Yes. I think they share the same pair. - No, they just look the same. - And the beards too. Everything looks the same. Do you have a message for my grandson? No family feelings this year. And next year? If he doesn't help us put together our performance, I'll never speak to him. I'll tell him. Seryozha, listen! This grandfather has given me an interesting idea. Well then, let's see the clowns. Go ahead, comrades. Hi, Top. Hi, Tip. - Oh, where are you Top? - Here I am. - Oh, hi, Top! - Hi! Tell me Top, why are you crying? You know, Tip, I'm getting married. My congratulations to you! And to your fiancee. Shhh! Quiet! Not a word about this! - Why? - She doesn't know about it yet. - What? Why not? - I'm getting married to another. Just a minute. Just a minute, comrades. This won't do at all. You're getting married and you're crying? This isn't normal. And what about this soaking handkerchief? - It's tears. - Wringing out emotional results. How much do you have to cry to have a soaking handkerchief? And no need to kiss. It produces an unpleasant impression. Comrade director, it seems you don't... I do. You say your fiancee doesn't know you're marrying another. That's not good. She should be in the know. - Tell her about it. - You think so? - But that's the idea, the humor. - The spice. No need of spice here. And what kind of names are those? - Clown's names, Tip, Top. - It's tradition. - Haven't you got surnames? - Yes. Well, then. Use your surnames, no more tears, and try to be more cheerful. - Comrade director, you know... - Forget it, Kolya. Marusya! - Hi, Sidorov. - Hi, Nikolaev. Tell me, Sidorov, why are you so happy? I'm happy because I'm getting married. Congratulations to you and your fiancee. I'm going to cheer her up with the news I'm marrying another. Marusya! Just a minute, comrades. This is absurd. If he already has a fiancee, why marry another? That's the whole element of satire. - That's the idea. - Namely what? That he's a thoughtless person and deceived his fiancee. - You mean Sidorov? - Yes. Is he come apart morally? - Yes. - Then why do you congratulate him? - You just don't understand! - Kolya. If a man has come apart morally, you need to say something about it, not laugh. And this whole look of yours is mystifying. Now, with all seriousness, go out there like real people, and quickly get to the matter. Go on, my time is short! Kolya, forget it. Elena Ivanovna, could you help me? I've got to read a fable tonight, - can't find the right one. - What fable? Serafim Ivanych asked me to read one on stage. Serafim Ivanych, eh? Fyodor Petrovich, I'll find you one. I'd be most grateful. - I'll come by later, OK? - OK. - Comrades! - In our midst, unfortunately, there remain instances of thoughtless... - behavior... - ...towards family and marriage. - We declare directly... - ...and as harsh as it may seem... That this is impermissible. Of course. That's it! This is something else entirely! Comrade Krylova, what else is left? That's all, Serafim Ivanych. - Where is the new orchestra? - They're rehearsing now. - Where? - On the fourth floor. Really? I'll go up and see for myself. Well, here comes the moment of truth. Grisha, how can you be so calm about this? - What of it? - Do something. And what can I do? If you don't do something, god forbid what I'll do! - If I do... - Do something! - Tell me first. - All right. I'll kiss you, OK? - Really? - Yes. Well? Anyone there? - Is anyone going to help or not? - What has happened? - At your service. - Get a mechanic here immediately. He's gone into town. Said he'd be back in about three hours. He'll get it when he gets back! Why are you standing around? Find somebody. - So, what happened? - He's stuck. - Who? - Ogurtsov's stuck in the lift. The lift suddenly and unexpectedly broke down. Well done. Listen, we still might get it. I don't know about us, but I hope I get it. - What? - You promised. Close your eyes. Don't peek. - I won't. - Honestly? - Yes. - Ok, close your eyes. Kiss me. I'm practicing! Got talent! - Hello, comrade director. - Hello. - Happy New Year. - Hi. Is someone coming at last? How did this happen, Serafim Ivanych? I've brought you something to eat. I knew a sandwich wouldn't go through, so I took some sausages and spaghetti. Eat them up, Serafim Ivanych. What sausages? Am I going to sit here long? Serafim Ivanych, where are you going? HAPPY NEW YEAR Get the best carnival masks here! Balloons! Wonderful balloons! They won't last! You put the slide up anyway? You can see how everyone's having a good time! A serious person wouldn't go in this way. As you see, this respectable person is dissatisfied. Why? I really like this escapade! - Comrade Telegin! - Hello! - Happy New Year! - And to you. And your wife is on her way? And how! Come on, Liza! - How was the ride? - Wonderful! - They thought of everything! - We try... Our concern is culture. Disgraceful! Enough to drive me mad! Attention! Comrades, friends! You won't have a boring time this evening! Believe me, be happier than the rest and you won't mess it up. Long live happy smiles, long live fervent laughter! Everything's going great. If only the speaker wouldn't turn up. So, comrades... Is the mic off? - Yes. - There's a change in the show. There'll be no speaker. It seems he wants to see in the New Year. We'll get by. The right decision, Serafim Ivanych. So the lecture will be read by me. What? And what's more... There'll be no mc. Not in the budget. Nominate another. Have I come to the right place? Yes. Hi. Comrade Nekadilov, a lecturer from the society of popular science. He's going to give a lecture on... - 'Is there life on Mars?' - Good, comrade Nekadilov. So: you go on and give a brief speech, no more than forty minutes, I think. Give your lecture. - We're done for. - I'll take care of the lecturer. - And the mc? - Grisha'll master the ceremonies. - Grisha... - I can't. - He can't. - What are you saying? I'll go... - All the way. - Well done! What do we do with the other lecturer? Well, comrades, let's begin. I'm the first, then you. Grisha, don't worry. Comrade lecturer. This way please. I'd like to acquaint you with the artful design of our buffet. - That's very nice. - Should we have a drink to celebrate the New Year? Just a quick one... Oh no, my good man. - I have a lecture to give. - To get in a cheerful mood. No, my good man, my lecture. Here's to your lecture and to astronomy in general! - I have to drink to that. - Of course, your health. Nadya, another round of the same. We haven't been introduced. - I'm Usikov, set designer. - Nice to meet you. I'm Nekadilov, a lecturer from... - We still haven't drunk to... - No. No. I have to give a lecture. If you say so. I'm interested in astronomy. What exactly is 'space'? Space is... - My good man, I have to... - Your health. Let me through! This one's huge! Comrades! Just look at this mask! It's the spitting image of Ogurtsov! What joke? What copy? I am Ogurtsov. What an actor! He can do Ogurtsov's voice! I'm not imitating anyone, just fulfilling my duties. I know who you are, you mask. And the nose's just like Ogurtsov's! - Like it's alive! Look! - Let me through, please. I need to give a speech. A speech! Even Ogurtsov wouldn't have thought of that! Stop, comrades. I won't permit it! Cease this undertaking! Comrades, I officially command you! Stop! I officially announce that this is untimely! We can't wait. What's happened with Ogurtsov? - Grisha's gone to find out. - Can't you hear what's going on? You can start when you want. Ogurtsov is flying around the foyer. He's being carried around. - He won't get away? - You've got 10 min guarantee. - Will we make it? - Yes. I'm going to go change. Be quick. Ok guys, places, quickly. I've a song for you to sing, it'll take me just five minutes. And if you let me I'll sing it. Let it fly around the world. I give this song to you. 5 minutes, 5 minutes, Ring the new year's bell today. 5 minutes, 5 minutes... And put all your quarrels away. 5 minutes, 5 minutes... You can solve anything. In 5 minutes, 5 minutes You can do anything. 5 minutes, 5 minutes. Ring the new year's bell today And put all your quarrels away On the clock it's 5 to 12. And the New Year's on it's way. The New Year will be here. Then we'll say 'Happy New Year'. On the clock it's 5 to 12. The New Year just won't wait. It's at the very gate. No time remains 5 minutes ticks away. Dear friend, please make some haste. There is no time to waste. Speak your mind, make your peace. It happens that at midnight tonight. One might decide not to marry in this life. But a minute changes all. It happens to us all. Everything changes once and for all. The New Year's nearly here. Happiness is near. And the young man sitting here. Will be a master. - In 5 minutes? - In 5 minutes. 5 minutes is not a lot. It hasn't far to go. And new year's on the road. 5 minutes' not a lot. It hasn't far to go. And New Year's on the road. Let others far and wide. Sing this song tonight. It took me 5 minutes to sing. Now the midnight bells will ring. The New Year's here. Happy New Year. Time moves us ahead. The Old Year's dead. Let's all sing and let's all smile. And celebrate the new year for a while. The New Year's here. Happy New Year! - Grisha, it's over! - What? Ogurtsov broke away from the crowd, he's on his way here. Only a miracle can help us now. Can you help us, magician? Please, help us. You see, he wants to give a speech on New Year's. - It's in his pocket. - Here he comes. Do something! There he is. Comrade Ogurtsov! Allow me to greet you in the name of the workers of the eccentric genre! - Hello, hello. - Happy New Year! - What? - Happy New Year! - All the best! - What's this? Has he gone mad? - Well? - A quick hand and no speech. Everyone's gone crazy! Curtain! Comrades! Let me wish you a happy New Year, - as they say, all the best. - Thank you! Allow me also briefly familiarize you with some of account figures from our palace of culture. I prepared a talk and... What's this? Heavens! What an artist! - Who would've thought! - A real talent. You're my witnesses, comrades, my speech was stolen! Serafim Ivanych, you're a hit! You should've seen Telegin applauding you! - He did? You saw him? - Everyone did, right Grisha? I saw him too. I did my best to make the mood right. Now for something serious. Where's the lecturer? - Here he is, he's ready. - Get him on stage! Hey, you guys... Comrades! I know you're wondering, is there life on Mars? From down here stars look tiny, but if you look through a telescope, you can see two, three, four or best of all, even five stars. If there is or isn't life on Mars, science hasn't discovered. We're not in the know. Assa! What's going on, I ask you! In our little garden, in our little garden. A little rose is growing... Farewell, comrades, I'm going on. - Grisha, don't be afraid! - I'm not afraid at all. Have a drink. Really, I'm completely calm. So I see. I'm off, Lena. - Go on. - Yes, Lena. - Grisha. - Here we go. Good evening, comrades. - Hi! - Hello! - Good evening. - You've said that! It's wrong to laugh, comrades. A man comes on stage for the first time and you'd say 'C'mon, comrade Koltsov, do it!' C'mon, Koltsov, do it! Keep it up! That's another matter. You know how hard the first time is. To sing for the first time, to slide down a pole. How hard to say 'I love you' for the first time. And hear 'I don't' as the answer. A few here have suffered through that, right? - You bet! - Most important to get over it and not let your spirits drop. More on that later. And now an ensemble of pensioners will perform a wrong and dance, sorry, song and dance act by composer Kruchinin, directed by Vastly Venediktych Sviristinsky-Shmigailo. They're really going to get it. Comrades, I officially and categorically declare that because of these numbers... Comrades, you've just seen how cheerful art makes the elderly young again, the timid, brave. Look around. You can see our waitresses Vera, Nadya and Lyuba. You think they only serve ice cream. But they serve up hope. They might seem shy, but you'll see. Oh Tanya, Tanya, Tanya. There is a funny story. She worked in the dining hall Of a factory. Her specialty was borscht And other kinds of nutrition And absolutely no one Paid her any attention. - No way! - Imagine! No one at all. And in our factory club They held a carnival. Everyone applauded One very special girl. Fights broke out that night Just to dance with her Flowers from Onegin And from a musketeer. Dammit! A breakdown of authority! A punch and judy show! Dammit! And all the factory workers In the dining hall. Ate and talked together About this special girl. No one knew where she had gone She'd worn this mask, you see. Tanya, Tanya, Tanya Serve some borscht to me. They don't know they're being served By the very special girl. - No way! - Imagine! By the very special girl. - This one? - Guess so. Damn, it's heavy! Grisha, I take it all back! - What? - About being timid and indecisive. - I've wanted to tell you that... - Well? That I'm going to announce the magician. The magician-illusionist Edward Nikiforov will now perform. I need 2 volunteers from the audience. Comrades, don't be shy. Good evening. Please give me your tie and your watch. Don't worry. Put them here, please. Disgraceful! You'll answer for this! I'll go straight to the top! - How did he end up there? - Makes no sense. Comrade Ogurtsov, how'd you end up in there? None of your business. I'll put an end to this chaos! Comrade magician, my watch? - What watch? - My tie? You took them. Oh, yes! Here they are. We all know our estimable accountant Fyodor Petrovich Mironov, and his well-known phrase 'Come back later, the cashier's gone to the bank!' But today you'll hear something different from him, the fable 'The Bear at the ball.' Fyodor Petrovich! Once upon a time there was a ball at the edge of the forest. The raccoon, the hedgehog, the deer and the doe danced a 'pas-de-espagne.' The grey rabbit danced a waltz alone. Squirrels and frogs danced, everyone drank dew and two cuckoos sang duets. Songs and rhymes. Everyone was having a good time, when suddenly a Bear showed up and asked why did the leopard sit on a branch? Why did the ferret go to the stall? Why are the raccoon and the mole dancing a foxtrot? 'Whys' and 'what fors' made everyone bored, and it grew sad in the forest. And in the green world of the wood Green melancholy stood. The moral is Why did the bear go to the ball? A good biting fable, and he read it well. We're increasing initiative, or at least creating the conditions. - And who's the Bear? - We'll find out. Fyodor Petrovich. Well... It's a good biting fable, you read it well. - So it's justified, then? - Yes, it's just unclear who the Bear is? Well, it's an allegory. Well, next time you read a fable, Fyodor Petrovich, make sure you give - the surname and his place of work! - That's exactly right! Comrades! A moment of your attention, please. Please will you... We'll see where this satire goes. Vastly Petrovich, put down the bottle, please. We need a serious atmosphere in the auditorium. Now, our head... ...librarian, Adeliada Kuzminichna Romashkina. Is going to sing. Distant years, passing years Memories forever sleeping Dewey paths Of gardens old Shady woods And first meetings How the night Hung stars in the sky A waltz both joyful and sad A waltz of promise, a waltz desired A tender waltz of parting Thoughtful and imparting. Familiar sounds alive anew What was dormant now renewed The heart knows oblivion nor hunger Just the restless state of being young How the night Hung stars in the sky A waltz both joyful and sad A waltz of promise, a waltz desired A tender waltz of parting Thoughtful and imparting A waltz of promise, a waltz desired A tender waltz of parting Thoughtful and imparting As wonderful As one's first meeting. - We never would have guessed. - You said it. - We entrusted her with the library. - You don't like her? Do you? Do you also like how I flew in the case? - Serafim Ivanych! - Enough of these Serafim Ivanyches! - I'll settle accounts with you all! - What's he thought - of now? - Don't worry. - Quickly, your act is next. - Get dressed! Don't worry! Congratulations, you were wonderful. I'd never have imagined you like that. - Are you disappointed? - On the contrary! If you grumble leaving home If a sunny day's no joy Let the smile cheer you up As you make your way The smile of an unknown boy. A smile without a doubt Hits you right between the eyes And the good mood that it brings Will never leave your side. If you and your beloved Have a quarrel once or twice, You'll know it was for nothing, If you look into each other's eyes. A look is worth a thousand words. And if you should recall The misfortune of another Remind yourself instead Of the numerous joys of others Tosya Burygina go immediately to the carnival headquarters. What the hell! We just got started! I wonder who needs me? Excuse me. Tosya Burygina go immediately to the carnival headquarters. Dismissed. Sit down. To the Trade Union. From the director... ...Ogurtsov, S.I. Despite labors to establish a cultural undertaking for all, several workers have turned it into a punch and judy show. Full stop. Due to their wilfull independence, comrades Krylova, Koltsov, Usikov and others in place of a New Year's carnival made who-knows-what! Knowing my hope to have serious evening the above-mentioned went beyond my authority, and put birds in my pocket, used my having fallen into a case in an act of magic without thinking of the danger it might cause to me or others which prompted unhealthy laughter in the audience. Guys! I left it on! Having brought this to your attention, I request that disciplinary measures are carried out against those who naively found I'm a fool. - Where did we stop? - Where they found you're a fool. Exactly. Full stop. - It's sad! - What? It's sad, comrades, that we're another year older. And since we're young, let's not waste time! - Shall we dance? - Absolutely! - May I... - I don't dance. - Grisha, maybe we should dance too? - Why 'maybe'? - What do you mean? - Why the timidity and... Of course, right away! Here we are dancing. Happy New Year! Everyone's looking! Aren't you ashamed? The happiest ever! - Grisha! - Lena! Grisha! Oh, all right. Close your eyes. Another trick? Close your eyes. No peeking? Honestly? Close your eyes. The happiest ever! Will it be? Comrades! Just a minute! Comrades, I officially announce that I take no personal responsibility for what happened here tonight!
