Subtitles by explosiveskull Okay, here we go. Two truths, one lie. I love your obsession with this game. Okay. One, there is a huge wine cellar in the basement, and we have total access. - Well, that's impossible. - Mm-hmm. Okay, um, two, the hot tub is currently out of service. - It's very sad for us. - Mm-hmm. Um, three, the house does have Wi-Fi, so you can answer your damn work emails. Hmm, let me think. Well, the lie is obviously number one. No one would be crazy enough to give us access to their wine cellar. I'm very sorry, Mr. Palmer, but that is incorrect. The house doesn't have a hot tub, just, like, an incredible pool. Oh, wait. So the wine cellar thing is real? Better than your hotel? Is this it? I-I don't know. Um... Hey, are you sure that this is the right place? Because this... Oh, thank God. You were about to be wildly optimistic about that place. Weren't you? Yes. - Mmm! Yes, you were. - It was... It was funky! - It was like... It had character. - Ah, you are so cute! - Yeah, it was so... - Rustic. Yeah, so, so rustic. Hey, is this it? I think this is the place. No way. Yeah. Yeah, this is it. - What? - Oh, my... It's even bigger than the picture. You turn... Okay. So cool. Oh, look at this place. Amazing. - Holy shit! - It's amazing. Are you serious? Bet I can see it all first! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ah, the kitchen! Ah, this place is amazing. What? It's gorgeous. It's so gorgeous. "Welcome home. "Please treat this house as yours for the next six days "while you have all the privacy you could ever want. I am only a town over should you need anything at all. Eduardo." Treat this house as ours, huh? And little does he know how we treat our house. We kind of have an abusive relationship with our house. What are you saying? You saying I did good? Wow, you did so good. - Shit! - Oh! Oh, my God. Ah, I'm gross right now, anyway. No, I love gross. No, I'm, like, really gross. I stink. And, um, you should stink, but all I can smell is your delicious cologne. Love how this always works on you. Interesting range, Eduardo. - Cheers. - Cheers. - We made it. - We made it. - We are here. - I mean, it's almost as good as Martha's Vineyard. What is up with you and your obsession with Martha's Vineyard? I... I mean, you loved Martha's Vineyard. No. This is so much better. Are you kidding? Mmm. You're calling that already, huh? Absolutely. I mean, look at this. Listen to it. It's like we're the only two people in the world. Oh, my God. It's just us. So... Why don't we put those away, lock them away? No... No more emails, texts... Instagram. Oh, really? You're not gonna be on Instagram all week? I don't need Instagram when I'm with you. - Oh, you don't need Instagram? - No. I mean, I don't know what we could just do, the two of us without any interactions all the way out here. What could we do out here? I don't know. I have a few ideas, though. - You do? - Hmm, yeah. - Like what? - I don't know, honey. Go put our phones away, and I'll... I'll show you. You'll show me? Mine's upstairs! Yeah. Look at you in all those clothes. What's wrong? I love you... so, so, so much. Yeah? Yeah. What's wrong? Sorry. I just can't with those things watching us. Stupid. Hey... we came here to fix this, right? We're not gonna leave until we do. Right. Uh... two truths, one lie. You ready? No. I'm sleeping. Okay, well, one, you're not really sleeping. You just don't wanna talk to me right now. Two, I just popped three Viagras in the bathroom. Three... Cassie. Eduardo. Mm, I love fucking you. Why would you do this, Cass? How the fuck could you do this?! How could you do this?! Oh, fuck. Oh. Hello! Hi! Ciao! Hey, asshole! Oh, shit. Ohh! I... I think I sprained my ankle. Do you... Do you speak English? May I? How long before this happen? Um, five minutes ago, maybe. Hmm. Good. If it was serious, it'd be a balloon already. I can fix this for you if you want. Okay. There? That's your house? - Oh, my God. - Yeah. We passed that last night. Huh. Have you... Have you lived there a long time, or... My whole life. Wow. Must be a peaceful life. I'm... I'm from the opposite of this, just outside of New York. Have you, um, ever been to the... the U.S.? Oh. Why not? Too many people. God, it's so beautiful here. I just... I can't get over it. Have you seen the inside of the house? Oh, my God, really? Well, you should come in. I could make some coffee and... - No. - Well, it's the least I can do. Mm, you're very kind, but I must go now. Well, thank you for saving me. Uh, I owe you. Oh! In Italy, you know, we kiss when... Yeah. Okay. Bye. Hi! I'm back. Hope you liked my surprise this morning. I'm sorry. - My God. - I'm so sorry. I didn't want you... Oh, such a disaster. I'm so sorry. No, it's... it's okay. Sorry. I'm... I'm skittish. Did you... You changed your mind? Yes. I would love that cup of coffee. Okay. Oh, no, it's okay. I'm sorry. I see him perhaps one time per month, so I would not say I'm so close with Eduardo. People are very private here. Well, thanks for making the exception. Not at all. You're joking. - Hey. - Hey. - What's going on? - Hey. Um, this is Federico, Eduardo's neighbor. Um, this is Bryan, my... my boyfriend. Ciao. Federico. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Ahh. What happened? You okay? Yeah, I'm just... I'm a total klutz. I fell on my run, so... Uh, Federico drove by, though, and saved me. You remember that house we passed yesterday? Yeah, Federico lives there, so... - Hmm. - Yeah. Um, but he was just telling me about the town, um, Todi. There's some kind of really nice marketplace. I was thinking we could go today. The Fair of San Guido. It's nice. - It's, um, really... - You, um... You okay to walk on that? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it hasn't ballooned up yet. I have to go in town this afternoon, so if you want, I can drive you there. That would be amazing, actually. No, that's fine. We can call... A cab might be easier. Good luck getting a taxi out here. I mean... He did kind of save me. Had to be a sexy Italian guy, huh? It was just a ride. We don't have to hang out with him once we get there. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna take a shower. Come join me. I'll be up in a minute. What the fuck? Oh, my God. You scared me. Hi. I missed you. What's wrong? What's wrong? Sorry. Sorry. Travel a lot together? Yeah. Yeah, we've been to quite a few places. How did you meet? Uh, we met at a coffee shop. You don't have to lie to him. Who cares? We met on... on Tinder. Tinder? Um, it's like, um, a dating app. You match with someone on your phone. - Ah. - Yeah. Bryan likes to say we met at a coffee shop, 'cause it's the first place we met in person. He thinks the truth cheapens us. Wow. You're one to talk about truth. I understand. I mean, men prefer to think in grand gestures. You need some drama to fall in love, isn't it, Bryan? Hmm? He still did that. He just saved it to the third date. Huh. How? I... I cooked her dinner. You know, candles, roses, wine, you know, whole nine yards. Chicken picatta in this amazing lemon sauce. It was... It was incredible. I was ready to marry him after that meal. He hasn't cooked a meal since. Welcome to Todi. So there is much to do here. Great café down there and marketplace up the street, which will give you the real sense of Italy. I mean, it's perfect. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Would you like me to drive you back later? Oh, that would be great, actually, yeah. No. We're... We can manage. Thanks. - Sure? - Yeah. Thanks for the ride. Are you serious? That's how you treat the guy who just gave us a ride? Oh, I wonder why that is. Oh, yeah, because no one is just nice. Don't be naive, Cassie. I... Hey, I saw the way he was looking at you. You saw what you wanted to see. Oh, please. Cassie, where are you going? Cassie, I-I'm sorry. - No, you're not. - You know what? Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't have to apologize for your incredible ability to make friends with assholes! Oh, you think this is about Federico? - Oh, my God. - Yeah. Hey, talk to me. I know it's my fault, okay? I know. I know what I did to you. I know how I hurt you. Cassie... I know you don't look at me the same way anymore. I can't stop seeing it. Seeing what? You and him, okay? Every time I look at you, it just... a visual... What do you visualize? What do... What do you imagine? It lasted all of two minutes, okay? I was so drunk, I couldn't even see straight, and then I was sober enough in the car to realize what I'd done, and... Or maybe... maybe you should know that I had been shooting down his advances for weeks, that you and I were fighting, and he offered to be a shoulder to cry on, and I... I never... I never... I know he's still calling you. Did you go through my phone? That wasn't your mom last night. Did you go through my phone? Are you still fucking him? - This is broken. - No. It broke when you let some other guy's dick inside of you. Cass... Ah, fuck. Sorry. Come on. What's going on? Can I help you? Please. How much? How much does it cost to get back to the house? How do you always manage to appear whenever I need help? Your knight in shining armor. You know, someone fucks up one time, and you just can't make it better. Thank you for... for helping me twice in one day. Ah, no, no. Uh, Maker's on the... rocks. Bryan. Mm. What are you doing here? What are you drinking? I... No idea. It's not what I ordered. What did you order? Uh, Maker's on the rocks. Lucio, due whisky con ghiaccio. Sorry about that. I mean... he's an asshole. I didn't expect to find you in this place. Yeah. Uh, well, Cassie went back to the house. She wasn't feeling well. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. Well... to a drink between men then. Cheers. Cheers. Mmm. Mmm. Good. My turn. Two more. This guy she worked with... he worked in accounting, Justin. And I was at their company Christmas party. Had a pretty epic fight earlier that night. You know, I was... I was in a band. I was gonna be a rock star, you know, and just elope with the perfect girl when I found her. But instead, I... am stuck in fucking finance, and I'm too afraid to commit to the perfect girl that's right in front of me. How fucking pathetic is that? Hmm. Had you met this Justin? Yeah, a couple times, yeah. God, and I fucking knew it, too, you know? I could see it in his eyes. And you? Did you... Did I... Oh. You know, God, mm, sometimes I wish that I could, you know, just to, uh... Even the playing field. Hmm? Yeah, just to even the playing field, you know, just so she knows what it's like to... to just see it every time you close your fucking eyes. Hmm. Excuse me a moment. Yeah. Okay, so enough of my sob story. Um, what's up with you, man? - What about me? - I don't know, man. I mean, you just popped up out... out of thin air. You know, I mean, what do you... what do you do for a living? Well, um, I work with computers. Mmm, so you're an I.T. guy? - Exactly. - Ah, yes. - Web stuff, you know. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you got that whole very... very quiet, smart thing going on, yeah. - What? - What's happening? What? No. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm good. They look at you. - No. No, no. - Come on. You wanna meet them? Mm. No, no, no, I'm good. No. Oh, come on. I'm... I'm... Alessandra! - Oh, God. - Hello. Ciao, Federico. Ciao. Ciao. Please come. I introduce you. Bryan visiting from America. Alessandra. - Hi. - Isabella. - Isabella. - Hello. Thank you. Um, so is he showing you a good time? It was getting boring, actually, before your stunning arrival. So do you want to join us? Sì! Come on. Have a seat. Ah, wow. Let's play a game, hmm? What do you think about that? Which... Which kind of game? It's called two truths and one lie. Bryan, do you know the game? It's easy. I say three things, and you pick up which one of them is a lie. I go first. Uno, Bryan's girlfriend was unfaithful. - She fucked another man... - Hey, hey. and he didn't do a thing about it. Due, Bryan is definitely going to remember this tomorrow morning. Tre, Cassie is all alone at the house right now... and I have the key. Mmm. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come... Come back to bed. Where's my phone? Bryan. Hello?! Bye. Uh, sorry. Are you free for... - Yes. - Yeah? Grazie. Cass? Cassie? Aw, Jesus. Are you just getting here? Yeah. God, I thought you, uh... thought you might have left. Where were you last night? I tried calling you a million times. I decided to stay at a hotel, thought it might be best for us to have a night to ourselves. Look, Cass... I think I lost my phone. Bryan... Cassie is all alone in the house right now. And I have the key. Was Federico here last night? Are you fucking serious? - Are you kidding me? - Look... he didn't come by at all? No. D-Do you really wanna start this again right now? Look, I... I just don't trust that guy! No, Bryan, you don't trust me! Look, I just... I ran into him in town last night, and I just don't want him coming by here anymore. Fine. You know, he's been nothing but nice to us. What did he do? I'm going for a walk. Hello?! Knock, knock. Oh, my God. Sorry. Don't mean to startle you. The door was open. Sorry. I, um... I didn't hear you come in. Federico, what are... what are you doing here? Uh, after seeing you in town, I thought I'd bring something to cheer you up. I'm told I make a fantastic coniglio cacciatora. Hmm? That's crazy. Yeah. I mean... Hey. What the hell are you doing here? Speak of the Devil, and he will come. Yeah. Federico was just telling me all about your night last night. You... You left a lot out. - What? - I mean, I was telling her how much fun we had last night. Yeah. Um, didn't tell me you made new friends. He... He said you weren't even buying drinks by the end of the night. Never get that buddy-buddy with the bartender when we go out. I guess... I mean, they just love Americans here, hmm? What do you think, Bryan? What are you... What are you doing here? Um, Federico was nice enough to come make us dinner. Coniglio cacciatora? - Brava. - Rabbit stew. Uh, it's not a chicken piccata, I know, but... Could I speak with you for a second inside? Of course. I was about to ask you to help me to set the table, hmm? My God. Hey, you need to leave right now. What? We're not friends anymore? Friends? Friends? I don't even know who the hell you are. I know who you're not. You're not Eduardo's fucking neighbor. Bryan... Tell me, which one of them was better? What are you talking about? Oh, come on. Alessandra? Isabella? It's been so long since I have had them myself. Can you please refresh my memory? Nothing happened. What was it you said you wanted, an even playing field? I think you had the night of a rock star. What the hell do you want? Nothing, nothing. Just introduce you and Cassie to one of the great Italian delicacy. Of course, there is another way this could go, isn't there? Hey. You guys doing okay? Yeah. Okay. Come on. Let's go to eat. Oh, here we are. Oh, wow. Smells amazing. Here we are. Okay. Oh, my God. This is amazing. - Hmm. - Seriously, Bryan. Wow. Don't tell me you are a vegetarian. No. No, I'm... I'm not. So how long did you say you were Eduardo's neighbor for? I don't believe I did. Few years. Why you ask? It's your house. Up close, just feels... Well, "rustic" is the word. Part of the charm, no? So you, um... you live there alone? Bravo. That's right. No wife? No girlfriend? Bryan. - What? - Come on. I mean, he's an attractive guy. You know, he can cook. It's just surprising, is all. You see, I don't play around. I want to find the right woman and commit. Well, if you make this for a woman, oh, man, she would melt in your hands, seriously. Really? Mm-hmm. Is that what it takes, Cassie? I see what you meant. What'd you say? No, I didn't say anything. Oh, come on. You said enough. What did you say to him, Bryan? I didn't say... Tell her what you told me. Okay, I will tell her. He told me about you. I must say... I could have guessed it the moment I set my eyes on you. The way you carry yourself. How do I... How do I carry myself? You let people inside, don't you? You trust in people. You invited me in without question. It takes a very special person to open herself up like that. He wouldn't shut up about how special you are. You should have see it. I mean, Bryan... oh, my God. This right here is a man in love. You know what I love about rabbit? The hunt, yeah. It's not like deer hunting. Pull the trigger, bam, it's over. No. With rabbit, it's different. You lure it in, make it feel safe, make it think it can trust... and then you wait, patient, the moment when the trap snaps, pop. The look in its eyes when it realizes... Ah, la vittoria of the hunt makes this meal so exquisite, hmm? Oh. Come on, Bryan. Eat. Well, let me help. Look, I think it's time for you to go now. No dessert? Listen to me closely. If you leave now and never come back, I won't call the police. You wouldn't. Try me. You know how long they'll put me away for cooking your dinner? Do it. Defend her honor. Um, where did... where did he go? I asked him to leave. Hey, don't start with me, Cass. No. Are you kidding? I'm... I'm glad. That was... I mean, you were right about him. Look, he's not Eduardo's neighbor. - What? - He doesn't live in that house. That's where I went on my walk earlier. No one lives there. It's abandoned. I mean, why would he lie to us? Look, I don't know, but, hey, look, if he shows up again, we're gonna call the police, okay? Who are you calling now? I just think Eduardo should know that some strange man is coming around his property, harassing his guests. Uh, ciao. I'm staying at your house this week. Listen. I just wanted to call and talk to you about this... this guy who's been coming around, claiming to be your neighbor. Look, I don't want to have to involve the police about, you know, the situation. His... His name is, uh, Federico, and... Hey. So what did he say? - I left him a message. - Okay. Come here. Need to talk to you for a second. Look, I need to tell you something. Okay. I was with two girls last night. Okay, we were just drinking in the bar, and I ended up getting really drunk, and they helped me back to a hotel. Look, nothing happened. I just... Nothing happened? Because... Because you were too drunk, or because you didn't want it to happen? No, because I-I wanted to be here with you, okay? Oh, God, fuck, Bryan. It's just... I've just been waiting for this, like, to happen, where you want to get back at me or... or take revenge or something, you know? I want things to be the way they once were, okay? I mean, sometimes we just slip right back into it. I know. - I just can't stop... - Oh, my God. seeing those images in my head. I mean, it's something that I have to deal with. Listen, I... I don't talk to him, okay? I haven't talked to him in months. He... He calls me sometimes, yes, but I haven't talked to him since I quit my job. Oh, I love you, Bryan. I... I want to spend my entire life with you, but... but not if it's a prison for you, not if what I did... Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, God, I'm sorry. I... - God. - If we have any, any chance of making this work, we gotta trust each other, okay? You know, I-I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I'm willing to do anything, but you... you have to feel the same way. That's all I want. That's all I want. Let's start over, okay? Go get us a bottle of wine, and... and meet me in the bedroom in 10 minutes. We're gonna make this better, okay? Okay. Okay. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Hey, Cassi... Cassie! There was no way that was 10 minutes. Cassie! Okay, throwing the blindfold on! Ready! Mm. You put on that cologne. Heh. Mmm. Mmm. Ohh. Jeez. Bryan? Found your phone. "Bella." Like, "Ciao, bella." Say, "Ciao, bella." "Ciao, bella." Oh, it's crazy. You're so crazy tonight. Fuck you. Did you put him up to it? Getting me drunk so I wouldn't come home? - What are you talking about? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Was it your idea to make a tape so I would see it for real this time? - I know what you did. Huh? - Where did you find that? I know what you fucking did, Bryan! I don't know what you're talking about! You fucked those two girls, you fucking, lying asshole! I don't know what you're talking about! What are you fucking talking about? - I'm talking about Federico! - Fuck Federico! I never fucking touched him, huh? You fucking got your revenge! You got what you wanted! Oh, shut the fuck up! Was this your plan the entire time? Or could you just not help yourself? Bryan! What is that? What the fuck is that? Has it been here the whole time? Wait. - Let me see. - What... What are you doing? Hold on. What is going on? Look, were you just upstairs a minute ago blindfolded? Yeah. You told me to. No. That was fucking Federico. He set... - That wasn't you? - No! He set the whole thing up! He's been playing us the entire time. Bryan, how would he have cameras... Think, think, Cassie! Think. Okay, have you seen Eduardo? Have you heard his voice? - Federico is Eduardo. - Oh, my God. He made the whole fucking thing up just to lure us inside of this house. We just need to call the police and get the fuck out of here. Hey, uh, ciao. Um, Listen, we have a... Hello? Bryan, what happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait. H-Hello? Fuck! What happened? The phone died! Fuck! - Oh, my God. - Wait. - Oh, God. - Oh, my God. Cassie, look, I swear I don't remember this. He must have fucking drugged me. Just call the police, okay? It's not fucking working! God, it's broken. It's... Let's get my phone. It's upstairs. - Fuck! - It's upstairs. Oh, my God. Oh, Bryan. I wish you hadn't seen that. Hey, hey, we just want to leave, okay? We won't tell anybody about any of this, okay? I usually just watch. I promise. Then I drove past you on that road. You needed help. I helped you. I didn't know we would fall in love. Hey, listen, man. We just wanna go home, okay? Whatever... Whatever this is, look, we will just forget about it, okay? No harm, no foul. No harm, no foul. Look, neither of us are hurt, okay? We could just leave this like we were never even here. I don't think this is possible now. Bryan! Fuck you! Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe. Oh, my... Oh, my God. He was gonna kill you. - Shh. Shh. - He was gonna kill you! I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. Hey, no, no, no. Stop. Stop. Stop. Oh, babe. Oh, I didn't mean it. Bryan? Bryan, what is that? Oh, my God. He was gonna kill you. Now we're... Oh, shit. - He was gonna kill you. - Clean up the blood! Clean up the blood. Clean up the blood! Okay, okay, okay. Cassie, come on! Come on. Okay. Shh, shh. Wait. I think... Oh, wait. Buonasera? Hello? Bryan? Is anybody here? Bryan? Cassie? Hey. Eduardo? Ah. Bryan? - Ciao. - Ciao. Buonasera. I received your message about this man who's been bothering you. Ah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. I wasn't expecting you to come all the way out here. Oh, no, please. It's nothing to make sure my guests are comfortable. I am the one who must apologize. Ah, you must be Cassie. Mm. Hi. So wonderful to meet you both. My apologize that it's under such circumstances. Uh, yeah, no, us, too. So, um... has this man come back around? No. It's been... It's been pretty quiet ever since I... I called you, so... Uh-huh. Do you know him? What did you say his name was? Federico. At least, that's what he told us. Federico. Right. Uh, sad case. Um, he used to live in the house down the street a bit before he lost it. Uh, money troubles, I believe. Uh, I didn't know he was still around here. Um, do you think he will continue to be a bother? I think we got our point across. Okay. Uh, well, um, if you don't mind, uh, perhaps I check the rest of the house? No, no, that's... that's all right. Yes. Make sure everything is secure. Uh, I mean, it's... it's your house. All right. Do you think he saw? Okay, we... we have to tell him. Are you fucking crazy? He's a nice guy. He can help us. We just murdered someone in his house. What? No, it's self-defense. It wasn't murder. Yeah. Yeah, at first, but not when he was on the ground having a fucking seizure. Bryan, you saw him. You saw him. He was beating on you. He wouldn't have let us leave, okay? I... I had to. It wasn't... It wasn't murder. Yeah, but it wasn't murder, Bryan. Look, I know that. I know that, and you know it, but they're not gonna believe that once they see you beating his brains in on tape. Oh, God. Oh, my God! But I can explain what he did to us. Look, we are in... we are in a foreign country, okay? His country. I was with him in town. - People liked him. - Oh, my God. All right, we are not winning this, okay, - at least not here. Look... - But I can't... - I can't... Bryan! - Listen! Listen. Listen to me. I am not letting you go down for this, okay? What are you gonna do? Fuck you! Fuck you! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe. Babe. You look nervous. I know. I... I just had a long day, I think, 'cause... Your vacation hasn't gone quite as expected, I imagine. No, it's been great. Where is Bryan? Oh, he's upstairs. Do you want me to get him? - I can get him if you'd like. - No, no, no. I can do that myself. Okay. You and I must have a talk first. Why don't you tell me what you did? My God. I didn't do anything. No, no, no. Don't. This will go much easier for both of us if you just say it. So what did you do? I... haven't done anything. - Are you sure? - Yes. What are you... Oh, just how you murdered Federico? No. Listen. Okay, it was self-defense. And this, too? Sneaking up on me to what? Defend yourself? No. I wasn't gonna... I was just being careful, okay? Sì. You could have shown Federico the same caution. He didn't leave us any choice. This did not have to become so messy. We could have helped each other, but now I cannot trust you, Bryan. Oh! No, no, no. No, no, no. No. No, no, no. This one's not on you. Okay, grab his legs. - Okay. 1, 2, 3. - 2... Hey. Did you find them all? I think so. Are you sure? I... I destroyed the hard drive that they record on, so it's all gone. Bryan, whatever happens between us, no one could ever know, okay? It's gotta be our secret. No one will ever know. Okay? Only us. Okay. Come here. It's gonna be okay, okay? Okay. - It's gonna be fine. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - 1, 2, 3. - 2. Holy shit. Hey, catch this. Oh, you're so far away. I'm here. Subtitles by explosiveskull
