[MultiCom Jingle] [soft piano music] - Find out from Wendell what's holding up the Nettleston contract, I thought we had a deal. [dramatic piano music] Good morning. - You're early. - Somebody told me there are 25 hours in a day, if you can figure it out. How are you feeling? - Like a whale. - Yeah, I remember, vaguely. [phone ringing] I'll get back to you tomorrow Richard, but I really don't think sleeping on it is gonna turn the tide here. No, I can't live with that number. Yes. Ciao. [dial tone] - [Voice On Machine] Hi, you've reached James and Donald. You can leave a message for either one of us. We have no secrets from each other, well, one or two maybe. Here comes the beep. [beeping] - James, it's me. Do you recognize my voice? Does it ring a bell? It should hon. This is the third time you've heard it in the past two weeks. The problem is I haven't heard yours. What's going on? You know how bonkers it makes me when my calls aren't returned. I hope you're not still ticked off about that ridiculous quarrel. I don't even remember what it was about. Bygones here, okay? If you don't return this call, I'm probably gonna start worrying. Have a heart. It's Monday the 23rd, and counting. [siren blaring] [dramatic orchestral music] - Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. - [Woman] Hello? - It's me. - Well, at last. What is it, are you still made at me, or what? - Can we get together? - [Mother] Are you still mad? You sound mad. - No mother, I'm not mad. I don't remember what it was about, either. - Good, I forgive you for all the rotten things you said, whatever they were. - Can we get together? - [Mother] Say when, lunch? - How about now? - Now? You mean tonight? - Yes. - It's pretty late. - Yeah, I know what time it is, mother. - James, you don't sound good. Are you all right? - Would it be all right if I came by? - Absolutely. - Sorry about the hour. - Don't be silly. Should I ask, or should I wait? - Donald has AIDS. He's gonna die soon, so it would mean a great deal to me if you don't get hysterical. - How long have you known? - He tested positive two years ago. - And you're telling me now? - I had to hospitalize him this morning. The KS has become very severe. - The what? - Kaposi sarcoma, it's a kind of cancer. He wanted to be at home, but I couldn't. It'll be better for him in the hospital. - He hasn't even looked ill lately. I mean-- - Lately? You haven't seen him in at least six months, and maybe what, two or three times, in the year before that, at most? It's gonna be very fast for him now. A week, maybe two. - Is it all right to visit him? - If you like. - For God's sake, of course I'd like. Why do you say something like that? That's terrible. - Let's be friends, all right? It's a good time to be friends. - I didn't know what kind of flowers he likes. I got roses. Roses usually say, and candy. Does he like candy? - He has a tremendous sweet tooth, I sometimes I have to be very stern with him about that. - Well I haven't had to deal with this since your father. - Deal with what? With what? - Dying. - Donald and I have been to 14 funerals in the past 18 months. [phone ringing] Look who's here. - Everybody comes to Rick. - Hi Donald. - The long one has to be flowers. - He's so quick. - If this is candy it's our secret. - The secret is out, and it's not on the menu. - See, things are already taking an ugly turn. I'm dying for a cigarette. - Have one. - [James] He gave it up. - Me too, three months ago. - It's hell, isn't it? - Oh, I can't be held responsible for my actions. - I gave up smoking for my health. The insurance company should come up with a whole new concept, irony insurance. I tell you there's a fortune to be made. Remember when we smoked? - Does he have any family? - His mother. His father's been lost in the mist of time. - I assume that she knew before I did. - Knew what? - About Donald, what's happening. - Donald and his mother haven't spoken for years. - Why not? - Her response to his sexual orientation was less than enlightened. - I gather you're understating it? - Considerably. - Well, she should be told, about Donald, what's happening. - Mother try to stop saying that, would you? About Donald, what's happening. Donald has AIDS, he's dying, can we please stop tap dancing, finally? - What's going on? Why are you so angry? What tap dancing? - Sorry. I'm a little stressed. I haven't slept in days. If I have a sudden compulsion to give up my tap shoes, I shouldn't hit you in the head with them, should I? - I'm not following this, James. - You were wondering about his mother. - I gather we're changing the subject, and not very subtly. - May we, please? - I think his mother should know. Whether they're on speaking terms or not, he's her son. Where does she live? - Arkansas. Donald was born there. - Are you going to get in touch with her? - No. - Well, what about Donald? Doesn't he want her to know? - I'm not sure. - Well, ask him. - I did. We discussed it at length. We even went so far as to locate her. She's in the book, a place called, Fayetteville. - And? - He'd rather not tell her, than risk her not caring. - Why didn't I know all that? - All what? - About Donald and his mother, and where he's from and what happened between them, all that? - We know what we want to know. I'll be in touch. [phone dialing] - Oh, Audrey Grant, is he in? - They're promising a 14% return. If you believe that, they'll tell us another one just as hysterical. What we need. [buzzing] Hello? Oh. Hi. - I need a friend. - You need a husband. I'm still available, but it's only fair to tell you I'm considering other offers. - I need a friend. - Let's see if we can find you one. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [soft piano music] - Then he drops this bit about we know what we want to know, and leaves me dangling with that. Well, what's that supposed to mean? I mean I know what it's supposed to mean, more or less but, what does it have to do with me? - Why do you still have that? Do you have a pack of butts tucked away in your bag, too? - James used to teeth on that when he was a baby. See, there are his teeth marks. - If you don't mind I'm not gonna get sentimental about something that was lighting the way to your grave. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] - Yeah? Hello? When the heavy breathing starts you're canceled, you got three seconds. - Hello. Am I speaking to Missus Barnes? Luanne Barnes? - That's who you're speaking to, who's speaking to me? [dial tone] [siren on TV] - I wonder if I've given you the wrong impression tonight. I hope you don't think this is the first time I've ever thought about it. I mean, what's happened to Donald. How could I not think about it? For years now, ever since we all first heard about it, I wanted to say something to James, but I never did. I couldn't. I was too scared to get the words out. - Is that why you're not telling me about James? - Telling you what? - Is he all right, Audrey? Or does he have it too? - Well of course he's all right. I'm sure he is, he must be. - You don't know? - Harry, if he wasn't all right, he would have told me, wouldn't he? Yes, he would have. - You didn't ask? [soft piano music] - You hung up? Why did you hang up? - Because I realized the instant I heard her voice there would be no point in it, when I told her who I was, and why I was calling. This is a woman for whom homosexuality is an offense against God, man, and nature. - Well, write her a letter. Send her a wire, she should be told. Let her make up her own mind what she wants to do about it. It would be hurtful for Donald if she doesn't come, but I think it's a chance you have to take. - Well, I'm not telling Donald. If she comes, he'll know. If she doesn't come, he won't know I asked her, and he won't be hurt. I don't want him to be hurt. - I hadn't thought of that. So, how are you gonna do it? - I thought of a way. Hear me out. - Why wouldn't I? - You could do it. You want me to phone her, no problem. - No. - You don't want me to phone her? - No. - I give up. - You could go there. And speak to her face-to-face, and bring her back. I know, I know how this sounds on first hearing. You don't have to say anything now, I'd rather you didn't, I'd rather you thought about it. But, not for too long. - I think I have this right. You want me to go to, where did you say she lives? - Arkansas. - Arkansas. And I go up and I knock on this door, and a perfect stranger answers it, and I presume I introduce myself, and then what? - You tell her that her son is gonna die, and does she want to see him before he dies? - Oh James, I think there must be a better way. - Tell me what it is. - You know I don't even know where Arkansas is. - We'll locate Arkansas, I know it's there. - Oh, smart act isn't gonna win my heart, James. - She lives near Little Rock. You'd probably have to stay overnight, but you'd be there and back in less than 24 hours max. - With or without her. - Well even if it's without her, it wouldn't have been a wasted trip, mother. Do you understand what I mean? Okay, well you don't have to decide now. Just sleep on it, would you at least do that? I think I was about 10 years old the last time I asked you for a favor. If you do this for me, it'll be 20 more before I ask you for another, I promise. This is her name and address and telephone number, and the name of a hotel in Fayetteville. If she'd listen to anyone, she might listen to you, the mother of a homosexual son. Do you understand what I mean? - Will you please stop asking me if I understand? Yes, I understand. There's one thing I don't understand though. I was talking to Harry last night. - Oh is that on again? - No. He said he knows me a lot, and you a little bit, but you and me together he doesn't know at all. I'm beginning to wonder if I know you and me together. - Are you? - It seems to me like something's getting very complicated all of a sudden. - We're not getting, it always was. - What do you mean? - And more so since Donald, since Donald and I have been together. I think there was a certain degree of composure in it for you when I was a carefree bachelor, the dashing unattached young man about town. But enter Donald Barnes to share my home and heart. Well, that made things a little bit awkward. What could you do but distance yourself from so perversely domestic an arrangement? Distance yourself from the fact that was Donald, which was to distance yourself from me. And what could I do, but respond in kind? Audrey says take three giant steps backward, and I did. - How did I do that? I really don't understand this, James. - Well by almost never asking when we spoke, how is Donald? By forgetting two of the three birthdays he's had since we've been together. By on more occasions than I can recall, inviting me out to dinner, me, not Donald. By never-- Well we need spiked boots Mother, you and I, to get over what's been swept under the rug since I was 18 years old. Mountains, mother. - Would you explain that to me? - This isn't the time for it. - Why not? - Because this is the time for Donald. And there isn't much of it. - How much is there for you? - I'm sorry. - I should have asked you the other night. I don't know why I didn't. Do you have it, too? - I don't know, I haven't been tested. I don't want to discuss it. - [Audrey] James. - I don't want to discuss it. Do you? Can you? [phone ringing] - Sally? - [Sally] Yo. - See what the schedule of flights is to Little Rock tomorrow, would you hon? - Little Rock? - Arkansas. - You're going to Arkansas? What's in Arkansas? [soft orchestral music] - Okay we can be on our way now. What did you say your name was? - Charley. You all settled in? - Yes. - How's your accommodations? - Great. That's where we're going. Do you know where it is? - You bet. - Is it far? - 30, 40 minutes. Your first time in Fayetteville, ma'am? - Yes. - Well let's hope it won't be your last. [dramatic orchestral music] You want me to wait here for you ma'am? Or should I drive on in? - What's this? - Ma'am? - What is this? - Well this here is the address you gave me. - This is it? Well, this is a trailer park. - Yes, ma'am. - But it says unit 16, I assumed it was a condo. - No ma'am, if it's unit 16, that'd be one of the homettes. - Homettes? - Yes ma'am. - Okay, let's find it. [dramatic orchestral music] We know this was a mistake Audrey. - Ma'am? - Stop and ask directions, would you? - Where's 16? - Take a right, first one. Who you got in there, Ray Charles? - Don't you wish? [laughing] Keep back. - Excuse me. [doorbell ringing] - Missus Barnes? My name is Audrey Grant. - Yeah? - I wonder if I could have a word with you? - What's going on? You sure you got the right party here? - Yes, could I come in? - [Man] Hey Lu, what'd you do, win a contest or something? - That'll be the day. - [Man] Don't forget that 20 you owe me, Lu. - May I come in please? - It's either that or start selling tickets. - What are you doing pulling up in here? - May I sit down? - Yeah yeah yeah, pull up a sofa. What'd you say your name was? - Audrey Grant. I'm from San Diego, California. - I know where San Diego is. - Yes well, I came to talk to you about, I'm here about your son. - What son? - Donald. Your son. I came to talk to you-- - Who in the hell are you anyway? Not your name, I got your name. Who are you? - I'm a friend of Donald's. - Oh yeah? - Through my son, Donald is a very close friend of my son's. - Uh huh. - He's extremely ill, Missus Barnes. - Your son's sick? - No, not my son. - What are you hollerin' about? - I'm hollering because I don't know what the hell I'm doing here, that's why I'm hollering. - Well if you don't know lady, I sure don't. - Look, it's your son who's very ill, Missus Barnes. He hasn't long to live. I'm sorry, there's no easier way to say it. - He's 28 years old. What's the matter with him? - He has a very serious illness. - Those are generally the kind you die from, the serious ones. - He has AIDS. - Yeah. Yeah, well I figured. - You figured? - Well he's 28 years old and he's one of them. What else could it be? I mean, I watch TV. Two and two's been coming out four for a long time now. Want a drink? - I'd kill for one. - You can get one easier than that. - A little water, no ice. - God's will you know, this thing they get. You do know that don't you? - I know some people believe that. - And you're not one of them, huh? And you didn't come all this way just to tell me Donnie's gonna die, did you? - I came to ask you if you would come back with me and see him, it would mean the world to him. - A phone call would have been a lot cheaper. - Well, we decided this would be the best way. - We? You and Donnie? - Donald knows nothing about this, it was my son's idea. Donald is a very close friend of James, my son. I just wanted to help. - Uh, you said that, very close friend. How close? They only have one kind of very close friend. - Look, it doesn't matter what kind of close. - [Luanne] You son's one of them too? - Oh, my son has nothing to do with this. - Wait I get the picture here, yeah yeah. Your son, my son, yeah I bet they're real close. What's all this beatin' around the bush? - I don't normally beat around bushes. - You sure come a long way to go a long way back for nothin'. - Couldn't you at least think about it? - I don't have nothin' to think about. - Oh for the love of God, he's your child. He's dying, what does it matter what he's dying of? - The only problem I have is what I'm gonna tell these people here about you. You and your big car. You and your big box clothes. - Look, I'm sorry about that, it was a mistake. - Nobody here knows I've got a son who's one of them. I wouldn't be able to show my face. - He's gonna die you stupid bitch. - Well if he wasn't what he is, he wouldn't be gonna die now would he? Would he? I hated what he is. It turns my stomach. You here me? - Get me out of here. Get me out of here quick. [crowd talking] [dog barking] [horn honking] - By the by, how did Mom cope? Your mother? Audrey, how did she survive her face-to-face confront with the grim reaper the other day? - She saw right through your flimsy tissue of wit, admired amongst us. - I thought she met them all really well for her. She seemed quite fearless. - Gin. - What? No mercy, even now? [toilet flushing] - See you later, Donald. - Your hair is like a field of silver daisies. I'd like to run barefoot through your hair. They don't write movies like that anymore. Mother for mother, I'd say mine has the better bargain of the two. One more hand, but only if I can cheat. - What better bargain? - To be spared all this dreck, blissful ignorance and all that. - How can you be so certain she'd want to be? - James, don't be a dunce. Who wouldn't want to be? Would you choose this if you had a choice? Would Audrey? I'm sorry. It's becoming time for another controlled substance, something by way of a mood elevator would be nice. - Here. You want me to get the nurse? - I'll be brave if you will. When are you gonna be? - What? - Not brave, wrong word of course. Sensible. When are you gonna be sensible? - I thought you promised not to bring that up again. - I lied. Please James, it just isn't rational not to be tested. - If I promise to do it, will you leave it alone? - Yeah. Could be negative, James. - Shall we calculate the astronomical odds against that? Let's find the nearest computer. - Michael Roby died two years ago, and Peter is still testing negative. - Peter wants to know, Donald. - Yes, and if God forbid he does go positive, at least he'll have the earliest treatment possible, won't he? As I might have had when I was still in the denial mode of me, it can't happen to me. - It's my choice, Donald. Mine. - I think I'm gonna win, and I haven't started cheating yet. - I gave it my best hon, really I did. - [James] Mission impossible. - She's one of those, it's-God's-curse people. - Oh yeah. Thank you for trying Mother, I mean that. - You're welcome. I hate her guts. - It's a new chapter for your memoirs. Come home. - You know what's gonna happen, don't you? On the plane tomorrow I'll think of exactly the magic words I could have used, that would have had her with me. - No you won't, there aren't any. [country music] - Come on Lu, give us a break, who was she? - None of your business. - It's all gonna come out sooner or later. I'm guessing some old rich uncle you didn't know you had bought the farm, and left you a fortune. - Be real. - Wish I'd been there. The way I heard it, we're talking lifestyles of the rich and disgusting. - Come on Lu, spill it. - Okay, okay, I won a contest all right? - No kidding? - No. - Well now we're getting somewhere. What contest? - Mother of the year. [thunder] [raining] [sentimental flute music] [phone ringing] - Yes. Hello? Hello? - Is he really gonna die? - I admire you a lot for this. - I'm not doing this to be admired. - I know that. - I'm honestly not sure why I'm doing it. - Well, maybe you'll find out. - I generally like to have the finding out part of things before. It's easier with less of the why-did-I-do-its after. Too many why-did-I-do-its tend to get you down, you know what I mean? - How soon can you leave? - Well, got a boss to tell I won't be in for a couple of days, throw some stuff together. Aside from that, anytime I guess. - Well, there's plenty of time, the plane doesn't leave until 6:30. - What plane? - To Little Rock, there's a short layover there to change planes for San Diego. - Change what planes? - Well we have to fly from here to Little Rock, on this little commuter airline. - You mean you didn't come direct? - From San Diego? - Yeah. - No. There are no direct flights from San Diego to Fayetteville. But it's a quick trip from here to Little Rock. - Oh yeah, I took a quick trip on one of their airplanes once. Lasted about half a minute. - [Audrey] What do you mean? - The propeller stopped turning. - What happened? - What happened is the plane crashed. The wings don't flap you know. - My God, were you badly hurt? - Broke my knee. Two people killed though. I'll be driving. - I beg your pardon? - To Little Rock, meet you there. - Driving? - Yeah. - You won't fly? - On one of them little things? No way. - Do you know what the odds are against your ever being in an accident like that again? If you live to be 200. - I'll tell you what it's about lady. Being laid up in bed scared cross-eyed for about a week after is what it's about. Waking up in sweats, three or four times a year, to the present day, that's what it's about. I'm not flying in nothin' that has less than three or four humongous jet motors. Get one of them to make a little detour to Fayetteville Airport, no problem. - I don't think I could arrange that. - Meet you in Little Rock. - Wait. How long is the drive to Little Rock? - About four hours. - I'd really rather we went together. - Why, afraid I might change my mind? - Can you honestly tell me I don't have to concerned about that? Look, I don't know you, you don't know me, but I do know how hard this is for you to do. And I know that part of you still doesn't want to do it. - You sure know a hell of a lot for somebody that don't know me, don't you? - Oh for God's sake how could I have sat with you yesterday in that trailer and listened to you and not know that? Maybe you could use some help to do what I think you most want to do. Four hours can be an awfully long time to go without help. - I'm not flying to Little Rock, case closed. - No you're not. We're driving to Little Rock, together. - It's a pretty drive, right now. Just tell me where you want me to pick you up. - Does this have air conditioning? - No, but it has windows that you roll down. - I have a suggestion. Well I can't guarantee anything James, this is strictly one step at a time. She's a tough hombre, I feel like I'm walking on eggs. How's Donald? - A bit of an upswing this morning. - [Audrey] Is that good? - What goes up. - Well, okay. Look, as of this moment, we're on our way. We'll be in San Diego tonight. I almost had to drive with her in her car all the way to Little Rock. Looks like a discard from Rent a Wreck. - Not a pretty picture, I assume you made other arrangements. [fiddle music] - Okay, we're out of here. [car starting] - No, thanks. - Doesn't that ruin the air conditioning, putting that down? - It's just while you're smoking. I used to do that. I don't want to get re-hooked. It's a daily threat at best. - Is it gonna be a problem? - No, go right ahead, no problem. - I've never been in a car like this before. I guess you figured that out. I'd really love to hear that radio, if I could just find it. [country music] - I have to find a place to stay when we get there. - It's all taken care of. We booked you a hotel room. - Hope it's in my budget. - You don't have to think about that, it's all taken care of. - I don't need it to be all taken care of. - Okay. How'd it go with your boss getting some time off? - Fine. I was a bit shifty about how long. What kind of time does he have? - It's hard to say. - [Luanne] Not long? - A week, maybe two. - I haven't seen him in 11 years. He was 17 when I kicked him out. - Do you have any other children? - Yeah, I have two daughters from my second marriage. One lives in Ohio, one's in Florida, we get together on holidays. - So, you English, huh? - Yes. - Your son is, too? - He was born here. - I never met anybody English. How about a pit stop? How'd you find out what your kid was? I found out by asking, how'd you find out? - He told me. - You mean you asked him? - He told me, I didn't have to ask. - You already figured it out, huh? - Uh huh. - I had to ask, not that I wasn't already wondering, long before. He got to be 15, 16, never any girls in the picture. Hell, you'd have to be a real dolt not to start wondering. - James had a girlfriend in high school. - What do you mean? A real girlfriend? - Yeah. - Why, you know what I mean, they had relations? - Sure. - How do you know? - Well, for one thing she spent the night with him, in our house. - Well maybe nothin' happened. - Oh, it happened. - How do you know? - She was a screamer. [Luanne laughing] - I just can't figure out, a kid'd jump the fence after he had a taste of normal. I get the feeling that you got no problem about your kid being queer. - I didn't throw him out of his home. - You like what he is? - It's not a question of liking or not liking, it's a question of accepting what he is. And I'd rather you didn't use that word, especially when we get there. - What word? - Queer. - Tell me something, if you had your pick, between your boy being what he is, or be normal, what would you pick? - Is he your friend? - Yeah. - He's my husband. - Sorry. - I got it too. - I'm here. - Of course you are. - Anything you want? - I wanted it to [muffled]. Are you thinking about New York? I'm so sorry about New York. - Shut up. - Geez, you were planning for it. - I'll always love you. - You're like a Christmas guy. So fabulous. If we'd have ever done it, we'd have done it together. There are eight million stories in the naked city, and that will not be one of them. - [Luanne] I don't know what I'm gonna say to him. - [Audrey] what? - Donnie. I just don't know what I'm gonna say to him. - Don't worry about that. - It's easy for you to say, honey. - Look, why don't you call me Audrey, and I'll call you Luanne. So much better than you calling me honey all the time, and me calling you nothing. - You like this music? [classical music] - I do, yes. - You like jazz by any chance? - I love jazz. - Me too. Get some. [big band jazz] What did he do? - I'm sorry. - Donnie, for a living, what did he end up doing? - He was, he's an architect. - No fooling? - He's designed some beautiful houses. He designed mine. - No fooling? - And he owns a small cinema. He's insane about old movies. He can quote entire scenes from memory. But that's just a sideline, he's an architect by profession. - Well, he was always drawing when he was a kid. Castles, he drew a lot of them. - [Audrey] Castles? - Yeah, a lot of 'em. - Have you ever been to California? - No, been to Las Vegas. Your son don't have it, does he? The disease. You son don't have it. You don't act like he's got it. - I don't know. - You don't know? - He doesn't know. - Well how come? Don't you get a test or something? - He hasn't done that yet. - Well how come, seeing as how Donnie's got it? - It doesn't always happen that way. They don't all get it, you know. - I saw this thing on the news, where a person can have it and not even know he's got it. Like it don't show up for a long time, sometimes. - Just think about Donald, okay? He's the one we should be thinking about. - I want to go home. - What else would we do there? - I want to go home. What do you say? Home James. - All right. I have something to tell you. - You know it's real hard for me to believe that there's any mother who wouldn't be bothered by her son being one of them. You as easy about it as you let on? - I wanted to be a grandmother, all right? I can't help that what people do in private is nobody's business. I could tell you some stories about straight couples that would curl your hair. - Oh, my hair stopped curling a long time ago. I either heard it, or I been there. - Why is it different? - Just is that's all. - You have to do better than that. - No I don't. - We have to try. - We? I thought we was talking about me? - I don't believe I'm hearing this. Why didn't you tell me you were doing this, James? - If she'd refused, I didn't want you to know that. - Why didn't she? Why is she coming? - [James] To see you, of course, why else? - Why, last chance Luanne, grab it while you can, and make it quick. - If you like. - You're assuming good intentions. - We have to. - You have to. What if they go bad? You don't know what she's like, James, or was. Compared to my mother, yours has been a picnic at the beach. Has she changed? What does Audrey say? - Evidently not. - I don't think I can handle this. - Tell me you really don't want to see her, and we'll put her on a plane back to Arkansas tomorrow morning. Can you tell me that? - Yes. - All right. - No. - It's worth the risk. I have no right to say that, it's your risk, but I think it's one you should take. - Mother of mercy is this the end of Rico? - All right, it rings the same bell, but you have me on that one. - Edward G Robinson, Little Caesar. Supine on a dark, ugly street, riddled with the bullets of implacable justice, gasping his last desperate pleas with his spiritual mother. Of course he dies. - That was a movie. - James, life is a movie. - How was the trip? - Flying used to be fun. - Is the hotel the first stop? - Nope, we're not going to the hotel, we're going right to the house. - You bet. - You can stay with me, okay? - Look honey, Audrey, if I change me mind, I can check out of your house as quick as I could a hotel. - Okay. - Thanks. - You're welcome. [gentle orchestral music] How are you doing? - Good, fine. - Is there anything else you need, in your room? - I couldn't think of anything else if I tried. Look, I don't want to come across here like a redneck hillbilly or nothin', but I feel like I'm in Dynasty. I mean that's the way I feel. I mean why shouldn't I say it? - I know what you mean. You know, I wasn't born choking on a silver spoon. - Sort of look like you were. - My father was a bank teller. - No kidding? Mine was a painter, houses, not the other kind. I got a friend, a guy, who says the trouble with this country is everybody wants to be in Dynasty, and it isn't near big enough so there's a lot of angry people running around. Could I trouble you for a drink? - Oh, I'll join you. - So, Donnie made this house, huh? I mean, he drew it up? - Yes, that's how he and James met. Through me, the house. - You know what just come to me before? You're the only other person I ever met like me. - Like you? - Yeah. The only other mother who's got a son like I got. - You've known that since yesterday. - Well, I wasn't thinking about it that way, not the way it's coming to me now. There's a logical way to think about things, you know. It's true. I guess I'm not the first person for you though, I mean, the way you live, the kind of people you know. - I know one other mother with a homosexual son. - So you had somebody to talk to? - The subject never really came up. - How could it never come up? - Well she brought it up once, but I didn't see any point in pursuing it. - How come? - There wasn't any point, that's all. I didn't care to discuss it. What's the difference? - It would have made a big difference to me. I never said word one to a living soul about it. - Well I like to think it's been of some help. - What has? - Saying something about it to a living soul. - Is that what it's been to you? A help? - Me? - I get the idea that you're not too talkie about it either. Is that right? - Well not for the same reason you haven't been, I don't need any help. - Oh, that's right. You're better'n me. I keep forgetting. - I never implied any such thing. But I don't call my son a, I don't call him ugly names. - Words never passed your pretty lips, huh? - Never. - Not even before you knew what your son was? - Oh come on. Everybody uses ignorant words when they're young, and don't know any better. But some of us grow up, and know better. - And some of us grow up and stay ignorant, right? - I'm not trying to insult you, stop putting words into my mouth. - Maybe there's some already in it, lady. - You just cannot believe that I am not like you. You want me to be like you. Well, I'm not. - Like me? What do you mean, like me? I got a son dying from what he is, and so could yours. I just wanted Donnie to be normal. I would have had a son all these years. That's all I wanted. - You had a son all these years. - One I could love. - You could have loved him anyway. - Like you love yours, huh? - [Audrey] Yes. - Anyway? You mean, in spite of what he is? That how you loved yours? - Oh stop. - Oh come on. Get the hell out of here. - Look, why don't we just say good night, and go to bed and get some sleep? Let's face it, we're both wrung out, it's been a long week today. - It ain't been my usual Thursday. - Mine either, honey. [wind blowing] - Testing, testing. Mary had a little lamb. [tape rewinding] - [Audrey] Sally, call Nettelston, tell him not to finalize the deal yet. It still doesn't sit right with me. Call Phillip to check on the Hendrix stock, it's making me nervous. If you can't reach him-- - [Luanne] Testing, testing. Mary had a little lamb. [dramatic piano music] Audrey? This is me, Luanne. This is to you that I can't do it. This is one of the stupidest things I ever done in my life, and I've done entertaining things. I don't know whatever come into my mind to think I could do it, after all this time. What would I say to him, after all this time? - [Voice On Intercom] Final call for flight 901 to Little Rock, boarding at gate number two. - [Audrey voiceover] I know no one will think too highly of me for chickening out at the last minute, but no one else is in my shoes so [muffled]. I'll pay you back for the expenses you went through. It might take a while. At least I'm paying my own way back. I would have done that anyhow. I'm sorry you went to so much trouble. I don't blame you if you're really ticked off. You really went to a lot of trouble. You're a really good person, but I wish I'd never laid eyes on you if you know what I mean. I hope your son's gonna be okay, and have life. Well, I guess that's all. [doorbell ringing] - I gotta do some shoppin'. My clothes are flying to Little Rock. - That, or that? No. Hi. Luanne, this is my son, James. James, Luanne Barnes. - Hi. - Hello. Thank you for coming. Would you care for some coffee or anything? We can go to the cafeteria. - I'm okay. We had breakfast. You? - I'm fine. Why don't we go on up then? - Are you awake? - The plane crashed, there were no survivors. I'm terribly sorry about Audrey. - She's here. - Can we discuss this for a few weeks? - It's gonna be all right. - Don't leave. - You want to think about that for a minute? [sad orchestral music] - What's wrong with this picture? - How ya been, Donnie? I guess that's startin' out stupid. - I've been fine prior to this current nuisance. I like your outfit. Tres chic, ma. - You kiddin'? It's Audrey's. It's a long story. Not that I don't have some nice things myself. But, it's too tight though. I got to do some shoppin'. - Would you like to sit down? Or do you have to run? I'm kidding. - Been a while. - You haven't changed a bit. You're looking very well. - Yeah well, don't let the hair fool ya. It comes off. - It's very becoming. - You got no accent anymore. - No. - Well maybe a little smidgen here and there. You can hardly hear it. Hear you got real successful? - Yes, I've done pretty well. Would you care for a chocolate? - No thanks. From drawing, more or less? - I'm sorry. - I mean you got successful just from drawing? - More or less. - You was always drawing as a kid. Some kids draw and come to nothing but, you was always real good at it. - You taped them on the fridge. - Yeah. Can I smoke in here? - He wants to go home. - I thought the two of you agreed? - He's reneged. - Are you gonna let him? - Yes. - Is that a good idea? - It is for him. In his place I'd want to be allowed to do what I wanted to do. [siren in the distance] - I have to ask you something. Why haven't you been tested? - I don't want to. - Is that wise? - Wisdom beyond my years I like to think. - James? - If I don't have it, it doesn't matter. If I do, and I said to you a few days ago, we know what we want to know. - That was about me. - This is about me. - Did they tell you you're in no danger? James and Audrey? - About what? - Me. This. - Yeah, they told me. - Sure you don't, really, you can have a chocolate. - This ain't easy for me, you know. I just want to be upfront about it. - Thank you for coming. - You mean it? - Mean it. - I wasn't sure. All I've been thinking about since yesterday, is if I wanted to come, until this morning, I started wondering, what your position was on the situation. - That's my position. - I'm sorry what happened to you, Donnie. - We said soon is mended. - But you brought it on yourself, didn't you? Didn't you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout. It just come out. - Arms restored, these are such trying times. - Is someone smoking in here? - To whose health would it be hazardous? How do you like Audrey? - Boy, she's something else isn't she? You know she's got me staying at her house? Did you know that? - That's very nice. - You know she said that what do you say, you designed it? It's real nice. Real nice. You know what I'd love to do? I would really love to take a swim in her swimming pool. Doesn't anybody ever swim in them pools? You know, in the movies, nobody ever swims in them. They're just there. - Take the plunge, ma. - There's something I want to show you. Remember this? Remember when you drew that up? You was about, I don't know, eight or nine. You said you was gonna build that for me, some day. For us. A magic castle. And we'd live in it together, you and me. And it would be full of magic. Your son's real good-lookin'. - Yes, isn't he? - Could have really been something with the ladies, couldn't he? His father must have been real handsome. Oh I mean, I didn't mean it that way, I mean that you are a very good-lookin' woman. - His father was a real looker. - You got a boyfriend? - No. - Me neither, lately. It's a bitch ain't it? - How did it go with Donald? - I hardly recognized him. He never was too hardy, built-wise. Took more after me than his old man. Freddy was a real big fella. Of course, he didn't believe that he was his old man. - Donald didn't? - No, Freddy. Didn't believe Donnie was his son. Said there was no way that any son of his, could be one of them. - That's insane. - Yeah, well even I knew that was a bit far-fetched. Still in all, I sure didn't like having to take a rap like that on account of Donnie. There's one thing nobody can say about me is I fooled around. I'd take 'em as they come, but I take 'em one at a time. - You didn't take a rap on account of Donnie, you took it on account of your husband. - Ah, either way. - No, it isn't either way. Don't you understand the difference? - I sure do tend to get you all stressed out, don't I? - Tell me what you want to do. - In regards to what? - Are you gonna go right back to Arkansas, or are you gonna stay? - How did she seem after? - I suspect a quickened pulse, plus a cardiac tremor maybe, but she seemed steady on her feet. She didn't rush to the ladies for a quick upchuck. - She wouldn't touch me, you know. - Of course. - Will she stay do you think? Do you know? - I don't know yet. Do you want her to? Sorry. [James laughing] - Prices are very reasonable, they have sales all the time. - I don't need a whole lot. - I have to go to the office. I'll see you back at the house around six? - He's really gonna die isn't he? [somber orchestral music] - That's a pretty outfit. - Yeah, real California. It'll knock 'em over back in Fayetteville. - What will you tell them when you get back? Your friends? - About what? - Where you've been, why. - I ain't got to that yet. - Maybe you'll tell them the truth. - I ain't got to that yet, okay? What's the difference to you what I tell them? - Here. I think I owe you something. - What would that be? - A few days ago when I was first told Donald was ill, I didn't really know much about him. I've known him for four years but, I didn't know anything about him that really mattered. I didn't know about you, I didn't know you even existed. I didn't know where he was from. The truth is, if the person my son had been living with for the past four years had breasts, I'd have known her entire life history in about one hour, because I'd have wanted to know it. - Yeah, well I kind of figured you were coming from a couple of different directions. - That's what I owe you. You know how you're always calling Donald one of them? There was something that bugged me about it, every time, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Then I realized what it is. Those are the words that have caused so much pain and fear, for so many, in so many ways, always. One of them. Those are the words that all the other words are about, ugly words. Your son isn't one of them. My son isn't one of them. Our sons our two of us. It's been an interesting couple of days. I almost started smoking again. - Well it's a wonder you didn't resort to controlled substances. Luanne and you, the mind can't quite grasp it. - She's a smart lady, in a rather irritating way. - Why irritating? - She doesn't know she's smart. Smarter than me. - Oh, but you know you're smart? - Behind a desk with a computer. - Why not? - She's terrible about Donald. There were times I could have strangled her. - The Luanne Barneses in our midst are best not taken seriously, unless of course, one encounters them in a lonely place coming at you with a baseball bat. - Well she's nothing like that bad, give her a break. - I gather you are. - She's right up front, what you see is what you get. And I'd rather get what I see anytime, wouldn't you? Beats deceit. It beats lying. It beats tap dancing. - Hands down. - What would you think, if I told you I was devastated when I first realized you were gay? - I'd think you might be turning in your tap shoes for a sturdier style in footwear. - I never have really been able to get it together since. That's what you meant the other day, the mountains under the rug? The woman of the world, taking it all in stride and falling flat on my face when no one was looking. - Sometimes when they work. - It showed, huh? - Now and again, yeah. - That's very embarrassing. - You did the best you could with what you had to do it with. Centuries of rules and revulsions. - You must have hated me. - Never. Never hated anyone. I did understand after all. How could I not have heard the word you never spoke? - What word? - Disappointment. - Okay, I was. I was, disappointed. There, it's spoke. - Good. - It was a long time before I stopped hoping you'd see the true light, marry the girl of my dreams, give me babies to lavish things on, and call me grandma. Oh, you made me so furious. - How? - By making me feel guilty about hoping that. - But you have to stop feeling guilty. - I know. I've begun to. I think I've begun to. James, if you knew I wasn't being honest, why didn't you say something? - Sometimes it's not wise to tell people what they don't want to know. - Can I give it another try? - If at first. - When can I start? - You're so pushy. - I want you to be tested. - Why? - Because the sooner I know, you know. We know, can I say we? - Let's try it. - The sooner we know, the sooner we'll know how much time we have to try again. - And if I test positive, could you cope? - Let's try. - I'm so afraid. - I know. I know. I know. - I might need you. - Oh God, I hope so. [somber piano music] ♪ The rain does a pitter-patter ♪ ♪ And I like getting wet ♪ Skies are weeping while the world is sleeping ♪ - The last one with changes of heart now. So let's keep it simple. It's ingrained. - At least that's [muffled]. - Give her a message James. I might. But you know what? Let them survive by [muffled]. In Fayetteville, Arkansas. - So would you manage a hot chocolate? - Hold the marshmallows. - [Man In Movie] Do you know how you're gonna spend your money yet? - [Man In Movie] Well for one thing, I think I'll buy an interest in time, for another, I might take a little ocean voyage. - [Man In Movie] Well, good luck. [thunder] - You got somebody to see to him? - A nurse will be coming in twice a day, and there's a doctor on call. - I think it's a real nice idea. Being here, home. He was born at home, you know. Wasn't supposed to be, he was supposed to be born in a hospital, but he ended up being born at home. It's a long story. These are real pretty cups, real California. - Didn't I give you those? - Yeah, I think you did. There are only four left. - Listen there's something I want to, maybe you'll think I'm coming down with a severe case of ridiculous here but, you don't have to decide now, you can take some time, think it over, unless you don't have to think it over and I'll understand that. It'd be perfectly okay. Just forget I asked. Okay, I'm just gonna lay it right on the table. I'd like it, if I could take him back with me. - Well I'm sorry but I really don't have to think about that. Taking him out of here now is out of the question. - Well not now. After. Oh no forget about it, I'm way out of line. Just forget I asked. [thunder and rain] You awake? It's me. I got you some cocoa. How are you doing? - Top of the world, ma. - You know I was just telling them now, I was telling them how you was born at home. You probably forgot that story, huh? Yeah, me tripping at the top of the cellar stairs, and busting my leg, and screaming for about an hour. You was halfway here, by the time Missus Ardeth from next door come running down the stairs. You probably forgot all about that story, huh? You didn't? Well, this is something that I'm gonna tell you that I didn't tell them, okay? I sure as hell never told you. I knew when you was conceived. Some women know that sometimes. I don't know how, I don't think anybody knows how but, it just happened, you can't explain it, you just know. It was in the morning. And after a couple of minutes, I just knew. It was this beautiful morning, with no tomorrow in it. It was like there'd never be a tomorrow. Life would always just be right then. [thunder] It was a waste wasn't it, all those years? I couldn't help it Donnie. - I know. - The trouble is, we generally don't know waste when it's happening. Sometimes when it happens but, the worst kind, we don't know till after. [mournful piano music] They say it's on time. - Will wonders never. - Now you don't have to wait. - No, it's no problem. [somber piano music] - [Voice On Intercom] Flight number 29 to Little Rock, will now begin boarding at gate number two. - I'll see you all next week. - Thursday. - It'll be a real simple thing, just a couple of my friends and you. Nothing like what you had yesterday. It was a real nice service. Sure had a lot of friends, didn't he? Well. Thanks. - What is this? - Something she wanted you to have.
