Ladies and gentlemen... Go! Go! You can't fucking do that! Sean, get down! Sean! - You can't do that! - Sean, get down! - Josh? - Stopping it? Stopping it? Josh? Johnny? Johnny? Josh? Sean, don't get up! They'll stop the fight! Josh? Josh, straight on it! Go on, Josh! I've always said I wanted to put Leeds on the map. When you grow up, and you're saying how you've become connected to that, you just start to appreciate things about the city. People from it. Being Leeds's first world champion, that's the dream. I want to make history for the city. - Are you ready? - Yeah. There, there. Yeah, whichever way it goes. There. Come on. Get your feet right. And again. And again. Go shake your hands down on the bags. Hoo. When I look back, I think boxing's always given me a different way of looking at life. When the Leeds Arena got built, I had dreams about fighting there. Dreams of people walking up and the excitement building. Every time I drove past it, I'd think... Even my pals would say, "Imagine fighting here." Now I'm gonna build an empire, make a legacy. Go on, then. Feet as well. Can we do feet? Yeah! Yeah, we're rolling now! Look who's there. Josh is there. Go on, get him. Come on. - How you going? You all right? - I like your suit. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome back to Leeds. The top-of-the bill fight between Josh Warrington and Hisashi Amagasa is a wonderful fight. Josh Warrington has, by far, the toughest test of his career. It's a fight that when we had the press conference initially, I took my hat off to the team for accepting. Josh, I think you know this is a real fight for you on Saturday night. Yeah, most definitely. It's someone that I have been training a hundred percent, and I'm testing myself to see if I can belong with the elite fighters. Obviously, you've got huge support, and you've captured the imagination of the Leeds people, but I think in boxing terms, you've always had a bit of a raw deal from guys that think you're just a fighter with huge support. And perhaps this is the win that will give you the credit on the world stage. Yeah, I mean, you gotta look at how quickly we came up. I've always taken every step as it's come. And I seem to pass each test with flying colors. This year, it's all about showing that I can move on to a world title and I'm eligible to fight for the world title. Josh has a habit of wanting to test himself, and he wants to prove everybody wrong. I feel like we're in a position where we need to be giving the fans good fights, while we're learning and preparing for a world title, but... you don't really want to take too much of a risk, because you want to ultimately move on to that world title shot. I'm quite concerned about the fight. He really has to be ready. And if he's not, he won't beat him. Quite simple. Come on, Johnny. Don't fuck about. We've lots to do. Relax, relax, relax. - Yeah, over the top. - You gotta fly high. Off you go. That's it. Just get the angle right on that shot. - Yeah. - Yeah? I'm gonna put his muzzle on now. Ey-up. Oh, here we go! Here we go! Let's have a look in my box of tricks. I quite like those ones that you're not posing for. You know what I mean? They're natural. You don't know when they've taken them and you don't know they're being taken? This is him here with his, er... English title. A few more boxing ones in here. Let's have a look. That's one of my favorite pictures, that. That's Joshua. Look at the hairdos there. Fucking hell! I might have that blown up and put it on the front wall, anyway. I can show you a few here. We've got Ring magazine there. Everybody wants their kids to do the best they can, don't they? Most of all, I wanted him to enjoy what he were doing. I took him down to the local gym with me, and he were hitting bags and things. He had his first bout at 11, and that were it from then on. Boxing mad, absolutely boxing mad. He just scribbled on it there, "Dad, we did it, mate. British champion, 20 fights." We boxed one kid called Ryan Bradley. And twice we got ridiculous decisions against us. It got to a bit of a point where I just climbed that ring and said, "What do I have to do to get a win?" Before I could answer him, our official said, "Get another trainer." It's not genuinely the case that I'm only there because I'm his dad. He wants me to train him 'cause he thinks I'm the best man for the job. Please welcome the challenger to the scales, from Japan, Hisashi Amagasa! Who are ya? Who are ya? Eight stone, 13 pounds and eight ounces for the challenger. And now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, the Leeds Warrior, Josh Warrington! ♪ Oh, Warry, Warry! ♪ Warry, Warry, Warry, Warry, Warrington... ♪ When you have the kind of fans Josh Warrington has, everybody labels you as a ticket-seller. And I think they're missing out on sometimes how good he is. That's why he wants the big fights, because he feels like he's got a point to prove. Some people suggest that you're only where you are because of your ticket-selling abilities, and people regard that over your actual boxing talent. They just see me headlining this big Leeds show and they note the atmosphere and they think I've always been like that, but it's been five years of progression and I've worked hard and I've had to pull out some good performances, and I don't think it gets noted enough. - Can you sign my arm? - You want me to sign your arm? - Yeah. - You're gonna wash it off tonight? - See you tomorrow, Josh. - See tomorrow, man, yeah. - Ingle's talked about me. - What does Ingle say? He said some nice things, actually. - Has he boxed Amagasa? - No. How does he know that Amagasa has a strong punching power? - 'Cause of his record. - Okay. As soon as the weigh-in's done, Josh will change as a person. And he's just thinking about that fight. If I'm worried about the fight, that has a big reflection, so I need to keep calm and chilled. When we leave that hotel room, he's willing to die in that ring. Josh Warrington will be in action this Saturday live on Sky Sports. He's up against Hisashi Amagasa. What do you make of this challenge for Warrington? Josh Warrington's a very, very good fighter. He lacks mad punching power but his work rate could be enough. And I like his fan base. Yeah, some people get a bit snobbish about the football element to his boxing support, but it certainly creates a wonderful atmosphere, - and it sells tickets. - Course it does. An amazing atmosphere, and here we go again, with this addictive, exciting boxing journey in front of the masses. Josh Warrington, the 25-year-old, who wasn't even sure he'd win a British belt... Keep in focus, keep in shape. This is where you're gonna show your class now. You belong at world level. That's why we're here again. We've re-mortgaged houses to do this. Seriously. He's not coming here to fucking take that away. Not a prayer. I never feel alive... until fight day. Everything what's happened in the time between the last fight day has been just going through the motions. I've kind of like been in a coma. Everything you have built up to throughout your life has come down to this fight. There's no feeling like it. And now making his way to the ring at this time, from Leeds, Josh Warrington! Seconds out for the 12th and final round! It's been another really good one, and another grueling affair. The Leeds man Josh Warrington, he'll still want to finish this in style and apply the pressure on Amagasa. Amagasa! In the heat of battle! Listen to this fanatical support in Leeds for Josh Warrington! Another good left hook. Amagasa can't get out of the way of these punches. Back comes Warrington! Takes loose. Left hook! His eye's cut. He's in trouble here. Amagasa unraveling in front of the Leeds faithful! It is over. A tremendous 12-round affair. Real high-class. All three judges are unanimous with their decision. Your winner from... Leeds! Josh Warrington! It's very, very wide on the cards. And I've gotta say, we thought it was closer... It's like, fuck me! Josh Warrington, a deserved winner? Yeah, most definitely. He did what he had to do. He fought it out... I'm only disappointed because I felt like I could've gone up and down a gear any time. Got on my front foot. I know I shouldn't get carried away, but I feel like when I get fucking going, - I wanna give them a finale. - Everybody screaming. He's one of the most awkward kids you've come across. I'll give you a bollocking later, but listen. - You don't stop 21 fighters. - Yeah. Do you? Stopped 21. A lot better than what they're giving you credit for. He's a lot better than they give him credit for. Lee Selby watching back in the Sky Studios. I wonder what he's making of this. He may have to come up here again one day. Well, Lee Selby, obviously a very interested spectator, and licking your lips after that fight and that performance from Josh Warrington? Well, it'd be easy work for me, I think. You asked me before the fight, do I think he was world level? And I said no, and after the fight, I still think the same. I think it'd be an easy night's work. IBF World Champion Lee Selby is quite keen on coming to Leeds to get the fight on with yourself. He's up for coming here or if you want to go to Wales, or he comes here, he's up for the fight. Potentially, can we get this fight on in 2016? Course he is, he's, you know... - Thank you for talking to me. - Thank you, thank you. Josh Warrington said he took, I think, three pages of notes on me. Well, I took all I needed to know about Josh Warrington and wrote it down on the back of a postage stamp. So, what did you learn this evening, watching him? I didn't learn nothing new. I know he can punch. He's got limited boxing ability. And I think if he got in the ring with me, it could end disastrous for him. The Leeds fans are impatient people. They want the Selby fight. You know, they want it now. They want their fighter to fight for the world title next. Joshua will put too much pressure on him. He won't be able to deal with that. Selby likes to work at his own pace. Josh will cut that gap and... No, he'll batter him. Fans don't wanna listen to me saying about how we're gonna protect a guy and build him into the right position and get him ready. Fans say, "No, no, we want... We wanna see blood." They're over there, aren't they? They're on the pitch, eh? Can I walk over and see them, yeah? - Superstitious. - How are you? It's not like any other normal team. We're all fucking pals, aren't we? - We're close mates. - Yeah. Have a word with them. Come and have a word. I'll let you do your thing first. - Give me two minutes. - Come and wish 'em well. 'Cause we've gotta go in now, look. Here, boys! Lee! Ash! Crawford! Berry! Quick word! No, honestly, I can see it. Warrington, Steve, over the past two, three years in particular, has built this following, this fan base around Leeds, and he's built this kind of Ricky Hatton-style following. It's no different to that. It's a straightforward working-class lad. He's on the terraces, he's in the pubs, and he's personable. This kid has not lost the human touch. Come on, boys! The city looks at Josh and says, "We like you. You're Leeds through and through, and you're the kind of bloke we wanna get behind." And I think that says a lot about a person. Go on, boys! Get in! Yes! Get in! The story so far has been perfect. Now it's all about getting the opportunity, and the rest is up to him. I'm joined by the world champion, Lee Selby. The Josh Warrington fight, is that off the table for the near future? Yeah, that's gone. We offered him the fight. Like, he called me out after every fight he has. And now we put the fight to him, he come up with some... some lame excuse that he's getting married. And a couple of weeks later... Well, a week later, two weeks later, he's announced he's fighting the same date, so it's a load of rubbish, it's a farce. I think he's just conning them Leeds fans. Josh Warrington will headline a massive night of fights in Leeds this Saturday night against Patrick Hyland. What do you make of that? I think it's a sensible fight for Josh Warrington, but at the same time, I do understand why some people are saying, "Why's he not boxing Lee Selby?" That seems like such an obvious fight for Josh Warrington. It is an obvious fight, but also the man, he's got momentum. Well, let's build more momentum. This Hyland fight isn't no walk in the park for him. Two toast, a few beans and one egg, love, please. And I'll have a tea. What you having, love? - Just a tea. - Oh! She's not eating today, Rachel. She's all nervous. - You what? - It's fight night. - Thank you. - There you, love. The situation was that they started negotiations for Lee Selby. We said we could do it any month, but August, he's getting married, it's his wedding. So far, boxing's been his life and he's sacrificed so much. One thing that he won't do, he is very, very family orientated, and he won't let his family down, he won't let his missus down who's stood by him thick and thin. The mileage she's put in, you wouldn't believe. So, he's not gonna let her down. Before we could kind of conclude negotiations, Lee Selby's management team took to social media and... started being a bit silly. Final decision on the Selby fight, this were me and me alone. When you can't speak to people or negotiate because they're being so... unprofessional, if you like... - Good luck for tonight. - Cheers, love. Thank you. - Are you watching it? - Yeah. - Good. - Aye, so, good luck. Cheers, love. Thank you. See ya later. That's a good combination of four, five punches together there. He packs this place out every single time. His name is up in lights. And he's looking to try and tee off on Hyland. It's a good smearing left-hand there from Warrington. And he goes down again! The towel has come in! And the fight is over! Warrington celebrates... Josh, sorry to break you away from the photos there. Is that the most accomplished performance of your career to date do you think? Yeah, I think so. There's a lot of pressure to keep on winning, when you're just on the verge of fighting for the world title, so there's a load of added pressure, but when you get performances like that, they pay off. I have to talk to you about Lee Selby, who brought up the wedding and said the reason that that fight couldn't happen and that that ship had sailed was because of the fact you were, well, you know, getting married to Natasha. When is that fight, and can it be made still, in your eyes? Listen, we wanted the fight at the end of the year. So, if he wants it, he can have it. We've got fans who will come anywhere. If we have to go to Cardiff, we'll do it. If we have to go to America, we'll do it. Going to have a quick word with Eddie Hearn. Just clear up that world title picture. The fans here want a world title shot, Josh wants a world title shot. - Can you deliver that? - For sure. I disagree with Josh. The world title shot should be here in Leeds. And if Lee Selby wants the fight, he's a great champion, we can do that in November here, no problem at all. Josh Warrington is ready for a world title and we really want to bring it to Leeds. Well done to Josh and your team marching on together. That's for her to hold there. Is someone gonna be up here to do that before you walk down? Uh, yeah. Do you see that, Lee? Two hundred quid and I only get half a waistcoat! Isn't it? - Give up worrying. - Making sure you look smart. - I do look smart. - You do look smart, actually. - I'm proud of you. - Thank you. It is my privilege and pleasure to tell you that you are now legally married, husband and wife. Congratulations. You may kiss your bride. Look at that. Catch 'em! It's now time for big Seanio. Pleasure and an honor to be here today to witness and celebrate such a wonderful occasion. What a fantastic place. I mean, look at it! When you've got a start like this, and you're so young, you know they've had to work for it. You know that they've made sacrifices. The stuff that she's had to put up with, absolutely horrendous. Not just him. But I mean, when we're in camp. He's away training, sparring, comes home in a bad mood. Not only that, on top of that, weeks before a fight, there's a sex ban imposed. I do it with him as well. So, I'm gonna ask you all to join me in a toast. To Josh and his lovely bird... I mean bride... Josh and Natasha! Health and happiness! Cut a long story short, Natasha, she's special to me. She sacrifices so much. Her character, her personality, she's so unique. I don't know a character like her. She's my best mate, and I love spending so much time with her. She's loving, she's addictive, a laugh. She makes me smile. She's beautiful inside and out. I love you, Natasha. Thank you. Come here. - You okay there? - Yeah. Here we go, nice and slow. You okay there, Josh? - Yeah. - Well done. It's really just a soft tissue machine, so anything soft and squishy, muscle, fat, water, tendon, ligament, anything like that, which is predominantly what you injure. And they'll be looking for any gaps and any changes that'll look like... um, there's been sort of an alteration. And it could be as subtle as that, and they'll stop you boxing. You okay? There you go, all done. You look too good-looking to be a boxer. Oh, thanks very much. You must win all the time, do you? Ah, here we go. When we look at your scan here, so this is slicing your elbow through, so going back to our model here, and that's your elbow like that. That corresponds to that, in that position there. And this bit of bone shouldn't be there. That bit of bone has grown as a result of boxing. You have been repeatedly throwing your arm into hyperextension, but also repeatedly being forced into, into flexion. So that is addressed with keyhole surgery to remove the loose body. I don't have no... direction, I don't have no routine, I don't have no focus when I'm not training. Especially when you've got an injury, you're limited to what you can do anyway. It makes it even more frustrating. People presume stuff. I've even seen some stuff on fucking social media, what, says I'm retired, so... People slag me off. "You'll never win a world title." But I've seen it, man. That's my focus, and... When I do it, I just wanna turn around and say, "I told you so." - Yeah! - Come on, Leeds! Come on, Leeds, yeah? - Cheers, mate. - Nice one. See ya later. All right, mate? Cheers, mate. - Go on, Josh. - Get in, lads. Good lad! I can clear up his obsession with me. Like, for the last three years, he's been mentioning my name. Even during his last fight in between rounds, I heard his father saying, "Lee Selby this, Lee Selby that." I don't know what it is. He's obsessed with me. Who's leading the animosity there? I think Selby's trying to wind Josh up. - He's winning. - Initially it was Josh. It's a phenomenal business opportunity in Leeds with Josh Warrington. - Would you risk him against Selby? - No way! Lee Selby is probably the most naturally talented boxer in the country. I think he boxes Josh's head off. Josh Warrington, 25 years of age. People argue maybe hasn't got his peak man strength yet, but just four knockout victories... He's a young man that works on volume. He throws loads and loads of punches. - Yeah. - Right? And he doesn't get the desired effect of knocking guys out... Concentrating on quantity more than quality. Too frenetic? Absolutely. I think that if he boxes someone like Lee Selby, I don't think it's a fight that Warrington wins. I think, you know, taking nothing away from him... All right, love. Two seconds. Do you wanna do a bit about the future and all that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, Josh, before we get onto your first love, Leeds United, your boxing career has taken a big turn, hasn't it? It's taken a very big turn. I've just signed with Frank Warren. BT Sports and BoxNation. The journey continues. Um, you know, still focused on getting that world title... Mr. Josh Warrington released a statement the other day saying that you've parted ways. A little bit of a shock. You'd been building Josh Warrington for a while now. Why? I wanted to talk to you about the Josh Warrington situation. Bit of a shock. Steve, what's happened? You know, things have to move on, and we're grateful for what he's done, but we're just gonna get on with building Josh's career. I wanted him to fight Lee Selby last summer. And he should've boxed Lee Selby last summer. We was quite happy to fight Lee Selby, and I'd verbally agreed to do it with Eddie, but we never got the offer in right, which we had verbally. Josh wants the Selby fight. Yeah? But there's people around him, they want it too, but they want it at the perfect moment for the perfect amount of money, and sometimes, when you're a challenger for a world title shot, that doesn't happen. His dad had spoken to some other people, and I just said, "If you don't want to be with me, then... that's it, really." Everything came... Everything came too quick. I'm 26 years old, and I'm my own man. And I've got to make my own decisions at times. Originally, I wanted to just sit down and go through it together the pros and cons about which route we take, but... I think it just happened a little bit quicker than that. This side of the boxing is just... it's what I dislike the most, you know? I just wanna put the gloves on, go train and go fight. There's been two or three occasions where the meetings with Josh Warrington's team, I've asked for Josh Warrington to be there and they've told him not to come. It would all be very different if he would have turned up. - Granddad! - What are we having? Can I see Casey's bedroom? Casey's bedroom? Course you can. Go get Casey then, Lou. Everybody's on about Eddie and Sky, and you live in that little circle there. I grew up in an era where Frank Warren were the man. And I've seen him build and build and build and... Josh has only ever grown up with Sky, you know? And Eddie. I don't think we've... I don't think we've made a bad decision. We just wanted to be active, really, not against Matchroom or Eddie, but... we just wanted to be active. With Frank, we're a lot more involved. You know, everyone says, "You don't know what you're doing because you haven't been a world champion." I don't think it's about that. I think it's about being good at what you do. Simple as that, you know? Some people are fighters, some people are trainers. And I'm a trainer, apparently. What's your name, mate? - Josh Warrington. - I-I'm gonna look you up. - Thanks very much. - Good luck with it. Can you pass me a receipt, as well, mate? Yeah, just stick it in Google. Leeds lad. Yeah, I seen that. Top man. I appreciate it. Thanks, yeah. I don't know about that. Cheers. Where are we, then? Fucking hell. Welcome, everybody, to BT Tower today, as we announce our schedule of live events for 2017 on BT Sport. I am not the person to do that, but our esteemed promoter, Mr. Frank Warren, is here to fill in the big picture of what it will all mean to our viewers on BT Sport. We moved to the 13th of May, Leeds's own Josh Warrington, who I'm really delighted has come over and joined our camp. He will be on that card fighting Michael McCullough. Josh has been out for a while, he had an injury, so I'm looking forward to seeing him in action. Let's find out if they are looking forward to it as much as we are because I have both of the two chaps here. Thank you, Josh. How you doing, Josh? To you first. I think within the trade of boxing, you have been... Josh, can I have an interview? Go on, mate. What we doing it for again? - Pep Talk UK. - Pep Talk UK. I tell you who we had. Two days ago, we had David Haye. We've had all the heavyweights on now. So, you go do that, and then what we'll do, we'll catch you in Leeds and go and have something to eat, yeah? All right? With me, I've got Josh Warrington. How are you, Josh? Excited to have announced the next date. I'm not sure that opponent's confirmed. I think there's been a bit of a-- some mix-up there. - I'm assumin' it was Michael McCullough. - Ye-yeah, but... That was on the top, on the board thing. I'm not sure about that one. But anyway, the date's announced. That's the most important thing. So where we are, I'm going to see Frank Warren tomorrow. So, I wanted to close off what we want to do. Obviously, in boxing, it all changes around, but we've got to find an opponent now. Obviously, you know what happened with Gavin McDonnell. Just... I don't... For me... I don't like... I don't like it. I think it's too far a step back. I like Gav as a lad and that, and I've known him for years. But I don't know, you can't go from Amagasa, and then go to someone like fucking Gav McDonnell. Do you know what I mean? So, is there any other names on there? Ryan Walsh? Are we up for Ryan Walsh if we get into WBO Eliminator? I am. He's got a really good following. He's a nice lad as well. His two brothers help him sell tickets. - He's a pick. - I like him. I like him, me. Right, give us a name. You give us a name. You can't say that because all I wanna say is Lee Selby. Do you know what? They did try Selby again, but... - They tried him again. - They didn't wanna know? They didn't want to know. This is all the time. It feels like a lot of fans, especially with Eddie building it up, they're always known for that now. "You should be fighting for the world title now." Eddie started all that media stuff and world title far too early. Far too early. Um... Golden Boy have offered you $100,000 to go over to America and fight him. I'm taking it you'd be happy to go over there, even though it means you're earning less money, but... it's great experience, isn't it, in case we have to go over to America? I think it'd give the Arena a rest for one. It'd give the Arena a rest, so everyone would be chomping to come back to it. - For half of the money? - Yeah. Yeah. And earning a wage slip. Don't make sense, does it? You're lucky if you walk away with 50 grand with that, aren't you? - Yeah. - You're taking a big hit there. You know, money is a massive part of it now, because we're in a very good position, but fighting on a massive card like that would be a good step, getting ourselves out to the American audience, and worldwide exposure. If you're going to Vegas, it's got to be for something. It's got to be for the right money. You know what I mean? You've had a bit of success, but not that much success where you can chuck nearly a couple of hundred grand away. - I'm not saying that. - You know what I mean? I'm not saying that whatsoever. You asked me my opinion. I just said my opinion, that's all. I didn't ask your opinion, did I? Yeah, you said, "That's what I'm thinking." - Then you said... - No, I said it don't make sense. Okay. It isn't even sport any more. It's business. - That's what it is. - Yeah. That's the way it's going with everything. But that's all I'm saying. You've still got this thing about being a world champion. And you will be. Five, four, three, two, one. Josh has, over the last probably ten months now, been out of action for an injury and various other reasons, but now he's back in the game. He picked Kiko for his first fight back. It's a tough fight back for him, and that tells you what Josh is all about. It's a great fight for the fans. It's gonna be a fantastic atmosphere in Leeds. I've heard so much about it. And on Saturday, it should be quite a unique evening. Do you want to do a bit of ropes and a bit of pads and stuff? Yeah. Where you going? - Eh? - Where you going? What do you mean, where am I going? Eh? He's only little, Martínez. He won't be hitting me up there. Need to pull it down a bit. Can you just fucking leave it alone, please? I fucking buy all those. I tell you what, you better shut your mouth before I fill you in. You're being very particular lately and precise and everything, you. Just calm yourself down. You're getting all giddy. Just put your fucking hands in here. Here. As he goes down for that shot there, just drop it, just single shot to counter that. Don't be in a rush. Settle down. Very erratic today, mate, very erratic. You're drawing your feet together and all sorts. I don't where it's come from. Some terrible fucking habits coming back out there. Settle them feet down, get some movement from your waist. Get your legs working with your hands. I know you are. What the fuck's up with you? I don't know. - Alright, stick with it. - Settle down. Get your fucking head together instead of falling apart. Get your legs under you, stop jumping forward. Drop your weight back. Feet are all over, yeah. Well done. I'm very close to my dad. I always have been. We have such a strong relationship, and he'd be the first person I turned to for advice. But sometimes, he can be overpowering. He tries to dictate everything. That's where a bit of animosity can be created. If I disagree with something he thinks, he might take that personally and it carries into the gym. If we're arguing, the whole family feels it. When my mom left us, he held the family together. He's put me first in helping me achieve my dream. You all ready to go? Sixteen fucking weeks. This is where you're gonna show your class now. Time I can never repay him with. Yeah, do you understand? He wants to go to war, you don't go to war. Do not swing with him, not until we're ready. - On your head? - In my eyes. - Eh? - In my eyes. Let me get it out. Fucking have it, boys! Come on! ...you've all been waiting for. Leeds, are you ready? Let's go to work, yeah? Everybody out! I were a little bit worried about him getting hurt at one time when he were only a kid. And we've had this argument. We've had massive stand-up rows, me and him. We might not talk for two or three weeks. That's it. Have a look. It's not all about boxing. We've got that mix of father and son and the boxing. ..to the winner, Josh Warrington! You've got to look after your kids. That's what we're here for. That's why we have them-- to look after them. I think you're having twins. I know. It's all right. - Yeah. - Come on, babies. I know. - Did I feel something then? - Yeah. Probably. - I'm just gonna reverse a call. - That's fine. Sorry. - I feel absolutely huge. - You're tiny. Do you think you'll have a caesarean, then? Well, I've told them I want one. I think they should with twins. They should operate. They offer everybody an option, just nobody knows that they offer it. - Really? - Yeah. What? When do you find out? When's your next scan? - Hopefully tomo-- Monday. - Monday? Yeah. I'm scanned every week now. Hopefully you find out. I've said I think they're girls anyway because I've gone off meat. I went off meat. Do you have any names? - For girls? - Yeah. It's gonna be Eliza and Olivia. - So, you really have thought. - Oh, yeah. I'll park it in this one. They've announced the twins in the paper today. About parenthood. Giving Josh an incentive for his boxing. So, that's like the first time anyone knows, really. It's something we've been working very hard on. We was trying to get a straight shot at Selby, but unfortunately, the negotiations became very difficult, so we thought we'll force the issue. We managed to get the IBF to agree to this Final Eliminator. Josh has got to get through Dennis, and if he comes through it, then Selby has nowhere to go. I have noticed, this fight, that every time BoxNation or BT Sports have put something up about Josh, everybody that comments on it are Selby fans. They don't think that he's good enough. But once this IBF World Title Eliminator's won tonight, then he's got nowhere to hide. It puts him mandatory to fight for that title. There's a lot of trolls online. Like, we found that out near the wedding. Like, one guy said, "Oh, wouldn't it be funny if Josh got his jaw broke just before he got married?" Oh, yeah, that's cracking, that, mate. Hilarious. I'll come and break yours and see what you say. So, has this pregnancy really taken it out of you? Yeah. Josh is like, "I'll go my separate way, now you go yours. You're going to watch me, I'm going to fight." I know how hard he's trained. I know how much he wants it and how much determination he has. I think he feels a little bit more pressure than I do. Did Josh get there all right? Because it is the IBF World Title Eliminator. He's nearly there, he's touching dust now. Oh, good. He'll be there soon. Hi. I'm Natasha Warrington. Yep, thank you. - That's for you. - Yep, thank you. He is the number-five-ranked contender in the world by the IBF, the former undefeated European, British and Commonwealth Champion, Josh "The Leeds Warrior" Warrington! Go on, Josh! Come on, Josh! That's it! On him, Josh! Put it on him, Josh! One, two, three, four, five, six... Don't get up! Don't get up! ..seven, eight, nine... Where are you, Selby, you fucker? Come on! Brilliant! Amazing! That was amazing. Whoo! After years of build-up, it's finally on. ..to announce what is quite definitely going to be one of the fights of the year. May 19th, Lee Selby will defend his IBF World Featherweight Championship against mandatory challenger Josh Warrington. I feel like I've already done this. I've seen this many times. And this is just meant to be. And on May 19th, I know a few things. There's gonna be a royal wedding, there's gonna be an FA Cup Final, and Leeds is gonna have its first world champion. The fight takes place at the home of Warrington's beloved Leeds United at Elland Road in front of an expected crowd of around 25,000 fans. ♪ Warry, Warry, Warry, Warry, Warrington! ♪ ♪ Oh, Warry, Warry! I think from today, that's 17 weeks. From my point of view, 17 weeks is a long camp, and we want to make sure he's not overcooked. Obviously, we've got the twins coming along, so we've got to find a rest period that suits them. - Do you want to carry on, Sean? - Yeah, I mean, to be honest, our best performances have come with shorter camps, or when we've done one camp straight after another. My idea, War', is doing an 11-week camp. Obviously, we're short there by six weeks, so that six weeks, what's gonna happen is, hopefully, she's gonna fire the babies out. He can get to grips with that, feeding them and training and anything else, and then we'll start a proper camp. This one has got to be the fittest I've ever been. I would say, personally, from my side, being in the ring, taking the shots, I need to touch on my defense a little more. I think so. We know the amount of training now to get to his peak. We don't want to overcook it. We all know what we should be doing, and we can finalize that between us, but we've got to stick to it. You know what I mean? Selby's a very good fighter. You don't get a world title and hang on to it. I've never ever said any other or thought any other. What I'm saying is that I think we can beat him. Give me some sugar. Yes, trust me. What day is it? Eighth. Eighth of March, 2018, your mom and dad here, Olivia and Eliza. Today you've been registered. It's a beautiful day outside Leeds Town Hall. We're proud parents, and you're officially people today. So, there you go. Well done, guys. "Well done, guys"? - Stand with them, Tash. - I am standing with them. Ah, she's smiling. She's happy now. Gonna change the world. And not get punched in the head for a living. That's good. I kinda don't wanna go. I wanna stay here and just like... Look at the town hall? Making the bottles, because it's feed time, apparently, but it just don't stop. I just wanna get a bath and have some breakfast. And this is what I get. If it's not one, it's the other. Obviously, this is the big one. A lot of media attention. Boxing's about timing, and the timing's right now. Maybe two years ago, it weren't meant to be, but now, this is the right time to go for it. It's been brewing for a long time. You said that in the press conference. It seems like there's a lot of tension. Something like what does annoy me is the fans getting stick because there's an old cliché that they're just football fans, but they're just supporting me because I'm a local lad, so they want to jump on and make sure I have as much support as possible. - Thank you very much. - No problem. Cheers. - I appreciate it. - All right? Off we go. One more time we're doing this. One more time, yeah? - Time. - Well done, Johnny. Get plenty of water. Four minutes, and then we're gonna go onto rhomboids. ...two, one, time. Come on. Let's show some skills off for your kids. Oh, baby girl. It's okay. Oh, sweetheart, don't cry! Ssh-ssh. Oh, no, I know, I know. I'm an 'orrible dad, aren't I? I know. What's your daddy doing to you? What you doing? Terrible, isn't it? Absolutely scandalous, I agree with you completely. Oh. Does that feel better? Does that feel better now? Yeah? Ey-up, lad, all right? Ey-up, my lad. How you doing? I'm good, geezer. Are you? Good, mate. Good, thank you. Do you want me to drop the tickets off at your dad's or yours? Um, my dad's, if you don't mind. Right, sound. Sound. He doesn't mind me coming down in, like, half an hour? He's not gonna go to bed early? No, no, no, I've told him. I've let him know. All right, mate, no worries. No worries, pal. See ya, mate. Gimme a kiss. Gimme a kiss. Ah, champione! Unbelievable. As soon as they were born, people were telling me, it puts a different focus on your life, and I can definitely vouch for that. Definitely agree with that. People don't realize, as a professional boxer, sometimes you don't get paid unless you sell tickets. So, I did that from an early doors. Tell people that, you know, follow my journey, they're part of it, and... I just wanted people from Leeds to just get behind me. We've got a massive fan base now, but there's a select few who have been coming from day one. I still go along, see 'em, drop them their tickets off. Even though I could just send them to the box office, I like the personal touch with it. - Hiya, love. - How you doing? You all right? I am, love. Come on in. You want me to take my shoes off? - No. - Are you sure? When were the last time they had an event like this at Leeds? Do you know what I mean? It's 20 years. It's probably another 20 years before it happens again. There you go. No worries. And then there's 300... L-31. I'm still waiting for some from L-30 as well. - Three hundred counted for there? - Yep. Sorted. Last one to get tickets. You don't want Daddy to go, no? Shall I stay here and have some cuddles? - I won't be long. - Bye. A few weeks back, Tash were sorting out some clothes and baby growers and vests and all that stuff, and I hadn't even seen them in half of that stuff. I've missed them little bits of times. I could tell when I said I weren't gonna be back today, I won't be back in time, I could tell she were gutted. That's it. Yeah? Yeah, don't miss. Don't miss. One of the key things with Selby, just do exactly the same as what you were doing, but then get that off from under there. From there instead of jumping back in. - From there. - So, bam-bam-bam, boof. - I've come round, bam, bam. - Yeah. Dig in, dig in, keep going. Mainly what we've been doing when we're doing this part of it regarding mental fitness, is looking for distractions. Getting distracted by random thoughts, getting distracted by expectations, what you're not achieving. If you don't achieve it, you are then dwelling on it a little bit. Our work has always been with a good possibility that we're gonna meet Selby in a big showdown someday. Selby's always been on the radar. If you can change somebody's mind, somebody's attitude, you can totally change them as a fighter. Time. With Josh, it soon became apparent that when he started to get noticed, people started to talk about him, he was selling a lot of tickets... Time. ..it had an effect on him. It had an effect on his performance. The crowd were getting to him. Josh would start having thoughts, could start feeling that he's letting them down. One-two, one-two. Little mistakes here can cost you the night. One-two, left hook, left hook to body. It's not going to be easy on May 19th. Selby's one-dimensional, but in that dimension, he is very effective. So, you have got to take his confidence away. - Two-five-seven-six. - Yes. Come on. - Good! - Come on! A big card in the UK this weekend with Leeds favorite, Josh Warrington, challenging IBF Champion Lee Selby at Elland Road. It's a great fight. Warrington accepts that he's a huge underdog. Lee Selby is as much as four-to-one on with the bookmakers. He believes that at the age of 27 now, his time has come. Do you think there's a chance that the pressure could get to Selby? It will not get to Lee Selby. That kid has got ice in his veins. There are gonna be times in this fight, I think, when Josh Warrington finds Lee Selby very difficult to pin down. He's gonna need the performance of his life, and as the bookmakers suggest, that has to be deemed unlikely. Not impossible, but unlikely. Lee Selby will be thanking his lucky stars that he's got Josh Warrington. Beating up Josh Warrington in front of his home fans at Elland Road. See ya, Selby! There is this buzz, and there's something special about an outdoor fight, there's no question about it. You know when he drives past Elland Road, when he's going from the gym to his house, he has a lump in his throat. He's got that rich affinity with that club. That means something to him. Will that work for him or will it work against him? I'm not sure even he knows. Every time I go out, someone will pass me. "Are you really fighting at Elland Road?" Now it's come to life, I should be, like, pinching myself, but... I'm not surprised it has. It's funny when I go down Elland Road now and I'm watching football, I'll sit and... look at the stands and look at the crowd. Envision myself walking out. And now we're there. All the pieces of the jigsaw are just coming together. This is definitely meant to be. What the fuck's this one here, as well? You know what? I'll just take all three. A pair of trainers for the night, look. Have you got my trousers, love? Are they my underpants? I can't go with no fucking undies on, can I? Should I put them in the dryer for a bit? What? Nah, they're all right. It's a bit of boxing, love, isn't it? I don't like to break with tradition. My lucky underpants as well, look. Bang on, them. I always take two pair. I like to be fresh, know what I mean? Hang on, have I got any on? We all love Leeds! We all love Leeds! Cheers, pal! You know, myself included, nobody would've had us down for getting this far. And still some people don't have us down for getting this far. If it all went wrong tonight, what they'd do is they'd say, "Well, we told you so." They forget about the English, British, Commonwealth, European. WBC with all the defenses. IBF Final Eliminator. They forget about all that. You know. "Well, I told you so." You know? You'll always get that, though, won't you? It's a Leeds boy fighting at Elland Road, in front of all these fans that, I keep saying it, they're the best in the world. They are to us. I know nobody likes us anywhere else, but that don't matter 'cause we're not anywhere else. We're in Leeds, aren't we? I'm so excited. He's already warned me tonight, he said, "It might look like I'm losing, but that's part of the plan." Thank you. Look in the mirror? All right, thank you. Yeah. Yeah, love it. Yeah. That's a lovely stroke. A little bit too much. There were too much length on there. Oh, it's just fallen short. And you can see the frustration in Tony's face. He's not happy about that. They'll be taking the piss on Monday morning, and he knows it. What would Janine from Accounts say about this? What time is it? It's the car outside. All right, I'll be down in ten minutes. All right, bye-bye. Come on. Come on, it's your day. Come on. - Thank you. Good luck. - You're welcome. Cheers, lovey. - Congratulations. - Thank you.

Are you still waiting for a load, yeah? Fucking hell! Cutting it fine, aren't they? Turn it back over. Yeah, I'm happy with that. All right. Right, that's it. Ready to fucking go. - Fucking have it, boys. - Go on, Johnny! There's only one way this is ending, pal. There's only one way this is ending, Josh.

And now let's welcome to the ring the defending world champion, "Lightning" Lee Selby! From Leeds, England, this is our main event of the evening! Right, listen. Nice and tight. Don't be stiff. Nice and relaxed. Just gotta slip in jabs, yeah? Right, lads, you both know the rules, so let's just have a good, clean fight, okay? Most of all, defend yourselves at all times, all right? Keep it clean. Josh? Listen, we're doing this, yeah? Don't get excited. Keep relaxed. Johnny? All right? Warrington's plan has got to be to not allow Lee Selby any sort of rhythm. Selby, technically, I think by common consensus, the better boxer. Warrington's super fit, super committed. Just relax! Relax! Relax! Selby, you see, clearly the taller man with the reach advantage. Good body shot from Warrington. Good boy! Just relax, be patient! Fast start from Warrington. Trying to bully Selby back onto the ropes. Both getting a feel of the strength of each other. A good left-hander from Selby, but Warrington replies with one of his own. That's it, Johnny. He don't like it. He's got a live opponent! He's had a good opening round here, Barry. Come on, Josh! That was a really good opening round for Josh Warrington. - Right, listen. - Yeah? He's not strong enough to hold you off. But stop that fucking lead hook. If I see you do that again, I'll bounce this off your head. All he thinks you've got is that. Be patient. This is yours, but settle down now. Trainers out! Round two! Warrington and his father Sean O'Hagan have studied long and hard, the action of Lee Selby in these big fights. And he said he spotted how easy he was to hit with the left hook, and it's been the left hook in the first three minutes which served Warrington really well. - And again there. - And again. And he pushes Selby back, Warrington. He's cut! He's cut! Was it heads that did it? He's cut over the left eye, Lee Selby. I'm not sure if that was heads or the right hand, John. Warrington is going after him now. And the crowd respond. They can see blood on the face of Lee Selby. It's gonna be fascinating to see exactly what caused that. If it's a clash of heads, it could wind up being a no-contest. Oh, good shot, Warrington! And again! Right hand, left hand. And Selby in trouble there! His legs, I think, momentarily stiffened. What a great round for Josh Warrington! Confirmed by the organizer that it is indeed a cut caused by an accidental clash of heads. Get out of the ring. Get the fucking stool out! Oh, dear, dear, that was a bit of a full-on piece of corner work from Chris Sanigar. They seem to have done a good job on that cut, at least for the time being. He started this round better. Good right hand, then a left uppercut there from Selby. Good round, this, for the Welshman so far. After a great start, Warrington's just struggling to find the range that he did in the first two rounds. Johnny, target his eye! Target his eye! And that's a great right hand from Selby. May have been his best punch so far, and Warrington said something, as much as to say, "Is that all you've got?" Well, those who said that he was gonna be totally outboxed, Josh Warrington, they've been proved wrong here. Come on! Good boy! Good boy! Good boy! Now he is told to back away, and the referee is looking at the cut. And the right eye is cut as well. Selby is an absolute mess in there. You can't do that! You can't fucking do that! Sean, get down! Sean! Josh? Johnny? Johnny? If it's accidental, it would go to the cards. You don't need to stop that! - That's nothing! - Get down, please. Sanigar's losing it! He's losing it! Josh? Johnny? A lot of protests coming from the corner. I said Michael Alexander could be a key man. He certainly is now. But he's saying the action goes on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's turn the screw! Warrington is busting Selby up with massive headshots. He is bullying the Welshman around the ring! Tremendous effort from Warrington! And that is a huge round for Josh Warrington! He's gonna look for big singles. And the big single's gonna be uppercut or right hand. So, let's keep doing it, let's keep the shape on when he exchanges. I've lost my fucking chewing gum, Johnny. In the bucket. Sean O'Hagan... ..brought Josh up for much of his life. Let's go, Johnny! He's taken a lot of shots, Selby, and he's taking more now. How many more of these concussive headshots can he take? And they're going now toe to toe. It could be pivotal moments now. Good work from Selby. A good left hook to finish the combination from Lee Selby. And again. Better work from the Welshman. You're letting him back in! Come on, don't let him control it! Oh, yes! It's coming down to the time when it's will and desire. I think the best work of the round came from Warrington, but probably Selby did enough. He's gonna come out and give everything. But he's only got a minute in him, Johnny. What we're gonna do now, we're gonna slip inside with that front hand up the middle, roll across with right hand over. Three minutes remaining. Selby in no mood to say, "Well done." Likewise, Warrington. And they are gonna go for it tooth and nail. No! That side! That side! One minute gone! How long, Nicky? Finish him, Josh! And a wall of noise is now cascading out of the stands and across the pitch here at Elland Road. They've waited an awful long time for this. Josh Warrington decried by many experts, and certainly many armchair pundits, as being a domestic-level fighter. He's shown himself to be very, very much more than that. Tremendous fight! And Josh Warrington raises his arms aloft! And I think Lee Selby knows it, that on the night, he has been outgained, and that the strategy of the Warrington camp has been spot on. Wait a minute! Calm down! Everybody, calm down! Everybody, calm down! Back to naught! Always an anxious moment for the fighters. But I think now that Thomas Treiber has the result up there. Ladies and gentlemen, after 12 rounds of boxing, we go to the judges' scorecards, and we have a split decision. Judge Alan Davis scores it 115-113, in favor of Lee Selby. Judge Phil Edwards scores it 116-112 in favor of Josh Warrington. And Judge Frank Lombardi scores it 115-113 in favor of your winner... and new... ..IBF Featherweight Champion of the World, Josh "The Leeds Warrior" Warrington! And how about a big round of applause for Lee Selby? Everybody! - Fucking lift me up. - Get here, then. It started with just me, my dad and my pals. Now it's me and the city. Winning, it just brings so much joy and so much happiness, and... I feel like we've done it together. Well done, darling. How'd the night go for you? Tell you what... My dad, it were always me and him. I used to think as a kid if I got into a fight and lost, I'd feel like I let my dad down. But if he said, "Well done, son," then I felt like a god. 'Cause he were my hero. He still is now. Why am I holding it? Cheers, everybody. Appreciated, each and every one of you. Everybody. Absolutely fantastic! Throughout the years of people saying, "You won't go far with your dad, you might need to change trainers." I feel like he's put so much into it that I always wanted to make him proud, I always wanted to represent him. When we win, we win together. When we go into battle, we go into battle together. I wouldn't have it any other way. I don't trust 'em. Tash... why not? Then they can't lose it. Can't reach it. Here you go, darling. Daddy and daughter day, let's go. Go see Granddad? Hello. Are you all happy now? Are you all happy now? Can I have a kiss now? - Mwah. - Look. Johnny, look at her laughing. What's he doing to you? What's he doing to you? I'm a natural with kids, Johnny. Look, she's stopped now. I'm a natural. I've got it, you see? It's a gift. Natural idiot. Smashed it, haven't we? We're a right team. We've done it. When have we got these? Tomorrow? Cannot fucking wait. Heh... Yes.
