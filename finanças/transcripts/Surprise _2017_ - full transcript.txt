(WHIMSICAL ACOUSTIC MUSIC) (STATIC FIZZLES) (WHIMSICAL ACOUSTIC MUSIC) (WHIMSICAL ACOUSTIC MUSIC) (CAMERA WHINING) Well I tell you what, it's been turned upside down this morning. Have you looked in Jenny's meeting? Well I can't because she's in the meeting isn't she and I want to film her when she comes through the door. That's all the best stuff. Good day, guys. Oh hi mate, we need a camera, a video camera and we need it pretty much right away. Yeah, we're having a surprise party like yesterday so we need to be out of here with a fully charged beauty and as the man says right away. Okay, sure, well let's see what we got here. This is the Palitrace 116E this has full HD... - Makes a nice sound... - Video recording, face recognition and 28 millimetre wide angle lens. That looks like just the ticket my good man, wrap her up and send her to my tent. - Excellent. - Hold your horses. How much is this Palitrace N-A-V ASAP. - VIP. - RSVP. - IOU. - This is actually... - a pretty good deal. - RIP. - IMF. - 1,580 pounds. - What? - Oh no no no that's a good price for you mate, now we're looking to lower our sights a bit. We just want a camera. We don't want to buy Universal Studios. Yeah, we want to film a party, not a Harry Potter movie. Yeah, yeah. And the point is I've already got a camera but I can't find it and this party is in half an hour, so we need something good, you know about a couple hundred quid. Right okay, um, let's see what we got here, um. All these are a bit out of your budget. Yeah, this might do actually. 100 now, so this has interchangeable lens with intelligent zoom and the new hybrid OIS operating system. It's two Vs though, that's not good. Ah, no we wanted two Vs, we need at least three Vs. Three Vs, three Vs on a TV. Yeah, definitely three Vs. What do you think, yeah? - Any good? - How much, how much? This is actually a really good price, this... - How do I look? - You look great. - Great. - So, I like this guy, how do we this? Do me the deal. Yeah, well I'll tell you what, you guys are in a hurry. How about I give you this, 300 right now, no questions. No no no I said about 200. All right, it does work properly. Final offer, 249. - Yes. - 249. - So how do we do it? - How do we do it? I'll go and enter some numbers in the computer. - Right. - Okay, I'll be back with the paperwork, 249, are we happy with 249? - 249, yeah, shake on that. - 249. - Well done. - You are the 249 man. Thank you very much. Okay, that's great, see the price. What's that what are you doing with that? Nothing. Did you find that on display? Because that shouldn't be on display. Yeah, I know. Well, you can't sell that. Mr. Talbet sent them back. They're part of the heat damaged batch. Shut up Nathan, I've got two guys over there who's gonna pay cash for this. Mr. Talbet's obviously missed this one. But you can't, it's one of the heat damaged batch, hence heat damaged, so you can't sell it. Listen I've got two guys paying cash for this. Counting on them not knowing what heat damaged means. All right. (CAMERA SCRAPES) Here we are gents, got that camera. Oh yeah.

Oh, that one's from me, Mike. Oh, Andy excellent thank you. Pete, I think you've done your stint now, let's swap. - Yeah, yeah? - You've excelled yourself. - Don't mind if I do. - So thank you. Good good good good. - What is it? - Oh. Ooh, it's a wine bottle opener. It's an electric wine bottle opener. Thank you Andy, that's lovely. CLARISSA: Here girl, you know this one. Oh, thank you Clarissa, did you, - did you want to wait for Mark? - No, it's okay. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) - It's from us? - Yes, I left it - on the table ages ago. - So I didn't need - to go to the car. - I just told you I left it on the table ages ago. MARK: I was out there getting the present and Jenny's opened it without me? - Stop making a fuss. - Well you could have - just waited for me. - She didn't want to. (GUESTS TALKING) (CHANGE CLINKING) (FOOTSTEPS ECHOING) Come on, come on, come on, come on, Jesus what is the matter with this thing? (GASPS) - Hey. - Hey. - Is it gone? - Nah, it's impossible it's as if it's been fused shut and melted. None of the fucking buttons work and I can't get this fucking flap to open. Okay, how did this happen? - Fucking Scottish tosser. - What? The Scottish guy at the camera place, he slipped us this camera for a couple hundred quid, asshole sold us a piece of shit. Oh God, okay, well I am not going to be covering it up next to Mike on the couch watching you and I going at it in the bathroom, so fix it. Okay, okay, but you're happy cuddling up with Mike - watching other things? - What the hell is - that supposed to mean? - You know exactly what it means. At the end of tonight, I go home alone. You and Mike as usual cuddling in on this fucking bed. Okay, Damien, calm down. We need to worry about this camera situation first, okay, just everybody's downstairs at the party, Mike's wondering where I am, where we are. This looks weird, we'll just stash it somewhere in here, - come back, deal with it later. - Yeah, yeah, fine. If anybody asks we saw Mark with it last. - Mark, right, Mark. - Just give it to me. This is ridiculous, totally ridiculous, Jesus I hate surprise parties. Look, I'll go downstairs first, you wait 20, then come down. (FOOTSTEPS CREAKING) Only me, just need a pee. (HUMMING) Oh. (WHISTLING) Oh. What have we here? Holiday snaps, nice. Jenny in a bikini, very nice, ho ho ho. Oh, um let's just close the door and... (BREATHES HEAVILY) - (KNOCKS ON DOOR) - Who's in there? - It's Nick. - Well what are you doing up here this is our own suite? Nothing, I'm not whack, wasn't doing anything really. The toilet was busy down there, so I came up here, I'm sorry boss I'll be right out. - Is the camera in there? - The camera? No. Yes. The camera is in here pointing right at me actually. - Can you pass it out please? - Yeah, sure, I'll pass the camera right out now. - And wash your hands first. - Yes boss. Sorry boss. Oh fuck, shit. Fucking shit. (WATER TRINKLING) What the fuck am I gonna do? Fuck. Jesus. (OBJECTS RATTLING) Nick, why do you think this is the second time I've had to retrieve this camera from a bathroom? - I dunno, boss, beats me. - Well, I don't want to see you up here again, this is private. Now I don't care if your bladder is about to burst. You stay downstairs, right? Oh, if I find out you've done a number two in there, you can kiss your Christmas bonus goodbye and give me that. I didn't do a number two, it was a number one. Jeesh, look, I won't do it again. I mean I will do it again, but I won't do it - in your own suite. - Too much information. - Thank you, oh Rosalind. - Yeah? - It's your turn. - Oh no no. - I won't be very good. - Yes yes yes. Take the camera and point it at people. Now please don't leave it in the bathroom. - Right. - Good luck. Thanks. Okay then, so this is the hallway and oh this is my favourite picture of the two of you, you both look so in love and beautiful. Rosalind I think you'll find that if you turn the camera, right around like that and now you're recording. - Oh. - Okay? - Yes. - All right. - Thanks. - No problem. ROSALIND: Now we're headed to the living room and this is where everybody is and oh here's Mike's mom and dad, say hello. - Hello. - Hello. We've done our bit, but we can go again. Take two. ROSALIND: Oh no no no, that's all right. - Okay, anyways. - Happy to oblige. - Have one of those. - There's my inseparable, go and have a word with her, see if she's got a little birthday message for our Jenny. - The table the whole time. - And? And you sent me to the car and then opened the gift while I wasn't there. - And? - And you don't think - that deserves an apology? - Why would I apologise - to you? - Right, I just want an apology and I want one now. No, I don't want to. You can fucking apologise or... Or what? Or I'll tell Mike the reason he grew tits last year was because you prescribed pathosolimene instead of bethasolibede. I get confused. You're a fucking doctor. They sound the same to me. Look it wasn't a big deal, Mike didn't even complain. He was probably too busy looking for a decent bra to cope with his ever-growing fucking tits. Look Mark, I'm really tired. Can we please go home and go to bed and be friends again? No, I don't want to. ROSALIND: Oh, uh uh, birthday messages for Jenny? Tell you what, I'll come back in a bit. So yeah, back to the living room and let's find oh Jenny, say hello Jenny. What the hell is that camera doing in here? ROSALIND: Oh Mike asked me. Damien, Damien's good on camera. - Excuse me. - Oh no no, it's fine. I'm enjoying myself. I have a little tale to tell if now's the right time. - Oh no, it's not really. - As you, oh please don't. As you know I have known Mike, Jenny for about three years. - Excellent, good story. - Mike, excuse me, Mike was particularly interested in a rather stunning splatter piece by Gambol Porter, very taxing upon him and he brought Jenny along to view the piece, yes and do you know what she said? No, I don't, I'm sure it was really funny. - Easy, easy. - Good one, good one. Yes, yes, what she said was she turned to Mike she turned to Mike and she said serious face, mind you, Mike why don't I fix you a beef in the loo and you can blast out your very own in the morning? (ROSALIND LAUGHS) That's when I knew she was a keeper you see because Gambol Porter's paintings are shit. (LAUGHS) Happy birthday Jenny. - Vol-au-vent? - Oh, don't mind if I do. Yeah, good one, Alan, good one. Well done, Rosalind, I think let the expert take over now. You know you've done your bit. Oh, I was enjoying that. Excuse me, everyone could I have your attention please for just one last time, thank you. I'm ready for my closeup Mr. Deville. - How's that, how's that? - Just do a closeup on me. Okay, right, everybody well obviously, it's a special day for my beloved, happy birthday. We've been together for four years now, is that right? And I have to say they are the happiest four years of my life. - (GUESTS COOING) - Changed him, changed him. And I thought I was okay, but the business I thought was doing really well, wasn't it John? Right, you bloody lucky when you fell in with me, didn't you boy? (GUESTS LAUGHING) I mean I'm the brains of the operation, as well as the good looking one. Thanks John, thanks John, Jenny will you just - come and sit down here? - Yeah. Before I met you, I just felt that something was missing from my life and then I realised it was you, so I'd just like to say thank you for sharing my life. - Happy birthday again and... - Ooh. - Oh look. - Will you marry me? Oh, I don't know what to say. Well most guys are hoping for a yes right about now. - Yes Mike, yes. - Oh wonderful. - (GUESTS CLAPPING) - Love you so much. Me too. (GUESTS TALKING) - Wow. - Oh yes. - Hold this for me. - Oh, okay. - I don't really. - Let's just say a few words to the happy couple. Guys, if you could just raise your glasses, yeah and I'd just like to say cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. And I hope you will be very happy! - Yay! - Woo! - Yay! - No no, Damien, Damien. No no no, you can't leave me with this, - I don't know how to... - Yeah, thanks for coming. - He's leaving. - Bye. - Oh Jenny. - That's so nice. - Bloody marvellous. - Good for you. All right everyone, let's get these glasses filled and raised, hip hip. - Hooray! - Hip hip. - Hooray! - Hip hip. Hooray! (JENNY LAUGHS) ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ Hey Bianca, when did you start filming? - Oh, just before the song. - Okay, get me, get me right. Well done you two, you make such a wonderful couple. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. BIANCA: Yeah, Grace, can you just take this for a second? I think I've got something on my shoe. - Give you that, give you that. - Oh okay. I don't know what to do with these things. - Bianca. - Got you sucker. GRACE: No, you can't leave me here with this. I have no idea what to do with this thing, no idea at all, I think what I'm probably gonna do is just put you down over there, oh. Please don't be angry with me, congratulations guys, bye. - Cheers, congratulations. - Congratulations. Thank you very much, love. - Well? - What? We've got ourselves a daughter. I know. Do you think they're gonna be thinking about having children? We'll find out soon enough. You see it makes me wonder if we did the right thing. Why are you thinking about that right now? Because if they have children, they're not gonna look anything like us. Grandkids never look like their grandparents anyway. Well that's not true. What about your brother and his heirs? Those poor kids. Look, he's not gonna know that. He's our son. He may not be our flesh and blood, but he is our son and that's the truth of it. Deciding to bring him up as our own was the right thing to do. I know, you're right, you're right, it's just Peter I wanted to be there at the wedding. - Shh shh. - To be there with you - and him before. - Shh. You will be there, you will. Yes, but he's gonna know that there's something wrong. - Shh, shh. - He's been pressing to me in fixing a date before it's too soon. Stop it, look at him. He can't wait to marry her. I could get him to set a date for tomorrow. He wouldn't suspect a thing. He's not going to know. Yes, but maybe he should know. I mean I'm not sure that we did the right thing in keeping the truth from him. Is he gonna know the truth of losing you? Then he'll know the truth. Tell the truth, tell it slanted, success in circuit rhymes, too bright for our own firm tonight, the truth superb surprise. As lightning to the children eased with an explanation kind the truth must dazzle gradually or every man it bind. Come on, come on. (GUESTS TALKING) Oh bugger! Oh God! - Hey you guys. - Hey. How is everything? - Fine, how are you? - Fine, well done. I'm good, oh thank you so much for this necklace. It's beautiful, you knew didn't you? Yeah, we did. (LAUGHS) I just happened to notice there's a camera right there. Oh, I will take it off your hands for you, huh? I hope you guys didn't say anything inappropriate. Pardon my reach. Oopsie daisie. Come with you little camera, time to smash you into pieces. What are you doing? Oh you know I'm just enjoying this lovely birthday party food. Oh hang on, is it an engagement party food? Yeah, no no no, it's fuck off Damien party food. That's what it is. - Oh Damien stop. - Yum. - Yeah, give me that. - What are you doing? - I just... - What are you doing? What are you doing? DAMIEN: I'm just filming the birthday girl slash bride. Yeah, well stop it. DAMIEN: I can't remember. It's on record, can I get a closeup of the total bitch? (LAUGHS) Charming. Are you done now? My turn. Just want to get a nice long closeup of a total shit. Ow Jesus, Damien. - Stop it, fuck. - The fuck are you doing? What the heck are you talking about? You just got engaged to Mike. Yeah, so? Look, you know I love you. Oh, this is bullshit, this is has never been anything more than sex and you know it. I do not know it and you do not know it. Look, what I know is that the girl I love and the girl who loves me has just got engaged to another man. Well too bad, because I love Mike and I'm gonna marry Mike. No, no, what you love is the bloody engagement ring - on your finger. - Oh fuck off. No fuck off you, just give me that. - No. - Yeah. - Oh gosh. - Because I want to film a little closeup of birthday girl and the buffoon. - Oh Jesus. - The bitch and the berk, the bride of and... Ha, can't think of anything else starting with B, can you? Oh bollocks. This is bullshit, Damien, we need to do something about this camera and we need to do it now. Are you gonna help me or not? Not. Nick, Nick? Yeah. Listen, you can be the keeper of the camera, yeah? Yeah, go on take it. All you have to do is just film everybody all night and at the end of the night you give it to Mike. I know he'll be really grateful. - Sure I can do that. - Great. - Congratulations Jenny. - Yeah, congratulations Jenny. Bye. - Ooh nice cake. - Thank you monsieur. NICK: All right, I'm going. Well that was weird, okay black to planet Earth. - They do look like shit. - What are you saying? - Oh, the happy couple. - Oh. I'm going to give you two a very special price - on our next piece. - Ooh, yes and congratulations to the two of you, that was so romantic and beautiful and Jenny, you could be my new boss's wife, cheers for that. You work for Mike, do you? Mmm, fingers crossed. NICK: Oops, let's pause for vol-au-vents. - Volva? - No no? Yeah, I had an interview with Mike a couple of weeks ago. Well yeah, don't you think that's a bit rich, isn't it? No no no, it's fine. - It's just... - Well he's kept you waiting on tenterhooks for two weeks? I'm sorry, but that's a bit rude. No no no I understand completely. - He's a busy man. - No no no. That's why I've got this little thing called the wanker tax, if I sell some tit painting, I just bung on the wanker tax, the bigger the tit, the bigger the wanker tax. I totally make it up, some of the stuff I've sold Mike has been double what it should be because of the wanker tax. NICK: Alan, you are aware that at no point have I stopped filming you since I entered the room? Yes, of course. NICK: Well why would you say those things right into the camera? This is their party movie. Well, what no. Nick, I think I'm getting my second wind, I don't mind taking over the camera again for a bit. - I'm good. - Well look, there's a little something on there that I filmed that shouldn't be on there so if I could just. - Oh you and me both. - Excuse me. - Hold on, hold on, look. - I don't know your name. There's no point upsetting the happy couple, - if I could just take...? - It's okay. Sorry, sorry, but can you just here, can you take the photo and just get a shot of us - with the photo? - That's a really good idea. - Come on. - Yeah yeah yeah. Jenny hey, come over here. - Come look. - Let me see. No, no, we have to get in order, okay. - Yeah, thank you. - Okay, see. Are we getting in the right positions? NICK: A little bit there, a little bit there. I look good, who is the most beautiful? Jenny, you're gonna have to get in position. NICK: I think you're all beautiful, got it okay, - all good. - Okay. - Oh my God. - It's so fun. - Thank you. - Okay, who else - has a story? - Hi. On me, three two one, cue Johnny. - Here's Johnny. - Well Mike you little son of a gun you're gone and done it now, - you've taken the plunge. - I have yes. - There's no going back now. - No. - Listen. - Hmm? When I think back to the day when I proposed to my own beautiful Helen, if I could go back to that moment, I'd run a bloody mile. (LAUGHS) Kidding, kidding, of course. Only kidding, but look seriously, congratulations Mike. - Thank you. - Congratulations Mike - and Jenny. - Thank you John and Helen. - Excellent. - She's got a lovely - bloody ass. - Oh John! What, we're married, not dead. Yes, married to me. I don't want to hear you talking about another woman's bum. Hey you too, that's my Jenny's lovely bum that you're talking about. Well I didn't say you didn't have a nice ass, did I? Now when did I say that? - Was it with women? - I don't know. When you say to women, there's a lovely young woman. That's not what they hear, what they hear is there is a woman who is so much lovelier than you are and younger than you are, because you are old and ugly, - that's what they hear. - Oh darling, have I told you how old and ugly you are recently? NICK: Hello Jenny, everything okay? - Touche. - Oh, what's Damien up to, seems very strange. JOHN: Because I've got that experienced older man thing going on, I've seen the world, done it all, got the T-shirt. I'm like a slightly younger George Clooney. NICK: Hello you two, still having fun. - Yeah, fine thanks, lovely. - Me too. - Yes, good to see you. - See you in a bit. - Yep. - Oh, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck. (DOOR RATTLES) Oh come on, come on, open you bastard. Oh shit, they're all gonna see me. Oh, who's that Mike? Oh, that's Nick, my PA. What's he doing? Oh, he's spanking one out over a picture of my girlfriend. Oh shit, fuck. Come on. I'm gonna lose my fucking, it won't open. It won't fucking open. - Who's in there? - Oh, it's me again. - It's Nick again boss. - What are you doing now? Have you got a bladder infection? - I just, I just... - Is the camera in there? - The camera is in here, yes. - What's going on now? You do know that we're gonna be sitting down watching all that footage don't you? - Yes, I'm well aware of that. - Because anything you're up to is gonna be seen. - I know. - Will you just - pass the camera out? - Yeah yeah sure, I'll pass it right out now. - Wash your hands first. - Sure, yes, yes boss. Oh Jesus fucking Christ. One week on the job fired already, brilliant, Jesus Christ, Jesus fucking Christ. Why does the camera keep ending up in the bathroom? - It's weird. - Yeah, that is strange. - Oh Andy. - Yes Mike? MIKE: Hi, Nick keep takes this camera into the bathroom. - No boss. - I don't know why, so I'm wondering if you could do your stint on it you know I know you won't let me down. ANDY: Oh no, I won't I'll get you some wonderful footage Mike. Okay, excellent stories, excellent stories, okay? ANDY: Absolutely Mike. Right, right, stories, stories, stories. Stories, hello everybody. - Let's have your stories. - Hey Andy, Andy. Get over here. Jenny, having your friends here, a little bit feisty.

Oh no no, Mike, Mike, I don't know if you're still watching but if you are mate, what can I say? Good luck and now yeah, I think I'll just get busy with these two, bye now. Bye now. - Andy, that's right? - That's right. I might have said something a tiny bit inappropriate on there, so if I could just have that. ANDY: No no, please don't try to take the camera. (SCREAMS) Are you all right? Are you feeling well? Oh dear, oh dear. Oh here we are. The King's Speech, do you mean yeah? What do you mean, how do you mean? I mean is a good film, Colin Firth, oh he's so lovely, I was so pleased when he won. Do you understand the game Sofia? Yes, of course you're trying to figure out the number two film of all time? No? - Yes. - I like this game really. I really like it. (LAUGHS) - Oh congratulations. - Oh hello Rosalind. - You look so happy together. - Thank you very much. I mean I don't mean a pest and this probably isn't the place, but it has been two weeks. Yes, this is not the place. I'll see you next week, okay bye bye. ANDY: Oh don't worry Rosalind. JOHN: The game is movie titles that describe the quality of your last number two. I see, oh ho and like a (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (LAUGHS) Splash. - Oh Splash? - Splash? - Splash yes. - That's the best one yet. Well done mate. - You know Cannibal Run? - Moving on. Oh there's Alan, well let's see what's going in the kitchen. So I said, no no no you didn't and she said yeah yeah, yeah I did. ANDY: Lovely food preparation going on here. - And I said... - Oh my God. - That's cat's food. - Oh hello. ANDY: You're putting cat's food in the vol-au-vent. - Jesus. - Oh, fuck it. ANDY: Everybody everybody everybody, I think you should all know that the vol-au-vent are not quite what they seem. No? No interest. Ah Mike, Mike, trouble with the caterer. I guess you're busy. - We'll get our something. - Yes honey bunch. ANDY: Nick, Nick, do you have anything for the camera Nick? Yeah, a couple of things actually, one of them's a real showstopper, but I think I'll just stay out of the frame for now if you don't mind. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Yeah, thanks. ANDY: Right, let's see what we can. Oh my God, not you, what are you doing? What are you doing? Well what are you doing? Oh, monsieur I am not used to having the camera in my kitchen and sometimes out of context, the ingredients may seem a little bit surprising. I am not sure what the camera captured. ANDY: I saw the cat food. Oh, shit, give me the camera. - No no no. - This will be the ruin of me. I am the Toast Potato and I don't care whether it's cat food, it takes fucking great, now give me the camera now. I don't care, give that back, give that back now. (OVEN CLANKS) Okay, where is it? Where is what, monsieur? Where is the camera? And you cut the faux French accent. I am French, so I speak with a French accent. Then tell me where the camera is. I might be able to remember where I might have seen this camera if you can guarantee that the offending footage would disappear away. Well, that works for me, now tell me where the camera is now and I will get rid of the offending footage. It's in the oven. What? (OVEN CLANKS) I can't believe you put the camera in the oven. I had to think fast, you saw the cat food. ANDY: That changes everything. - What do you mean? - Well you put the camera in the oven and I will not now get rid of the cat food footage. You little shit now get the fuck out of my kitchen or I'll have you, do you understand me? - Get out. - Jesus, she's gone bananas, totally mad, do not use that mad woman for catering for your wedding Mike. Now I need a quiet spot for let's go in here and see what we can find, lovely, lovely. (GUESTS TALKING) (MUSIC BOOMING) (DOOR SNAPS) Hello. Hello Mike. Hi Jenny. You've just seen some mad caterers and God knows what else and now it's me. It's funny. Hearing your future, me sitting here in your past and it's the present now. The past, present. I only say the present is a present because it's a gift and just forget, forget it I probably should start again. I'm very sorry to bring this up on your birthday, Jenny. The fact is the fact is I love you. Mike that is, not you, Jenny, not that you're not a good girl, but no I mean Mike. I always have, ever since we first met. Not that I expect anything of you, I don't want you to leave Jenny and come and be with me, but God knows, but I can't live like this anymore. I'm too much of a coward to say it to you face to face in the flesh so to speak. Pathetic. I've said it loud. Let the chips falls where they may. Can you just remember that this is just a man sitting in front of another man. All right, come on. Oh Andy, do you mind if we have a quick quiet conference? Business stuff, pain in the ass. No, but off you go and cheers. - Close that. - So, what does it say? Let me see, yeah, the investment committee have approved the proposition and four million dollars in commissions, however, the commercial sensitivities mean the non-disclosure provisions you entered into preclude commissions from being extended beyond yourself and Helen, I'm afraid you'll have to deal with Mike, otherwise the deal is off. Your call, best Fletcher. Oh my God. I know. A third of four millions dollars. I know. So that means you can get the LD and the Bentley and both Henry and Peter can board. We only have to say the word and Mike's out. Gosh, this is so exciting. Are you telling me that you are willing to shaft our oldest and dearest friend and business partner out of his share of one third of four million dollars, is that what you're telling me? Yes. That's my girl. (HELEN LAUGHS) So how do we proceed? (GASPS) John! Oh fuck! - Can you erase it? - Fuck! I'll fucking smash the bugger. (STATIC FIZZLES) You fucking (SCREAMS) (STATIC FIZZLES) Fuck, you fucking camera! What are you doing to the camera? What do you mean what am I doing to the camera? I'm obviously fixing it. Yeah, but you're punching seven bells out of it. It's stuck on record, if you give it a little bum bash it'll reset or something. Give it to me. I've been hunting for this camera all evening. It's more trouble than it's worth. Oh, oh, hello dad. - Hello son. - Going upstairs. Yes, your mom's feeling a little bit peaky. - Oh. - That's right. - I'll take the camera. - You wouldn't mind just taking her upstairs and getting her to lie down for a while, I'll give this to Damien. Damien, all right. Well I'll take you upstairs mom. I'll be all right dear, don't worry. - Thanks son, thanks. - No problem. I'm sure I'll be all right, I just need to lay down - for a little bit. - Okie dokie. And I think I'll be well. So let's go into the bedroom. (STAIRS CREAKING) This is lovely. - It's nice comfortable one. - Yes, this is nice isn't it? Just swing your legs up here. My legs up here, I'll be fine. - Just support your back. - Oh yeah. - Thanks son. - Sure she's okay? PETER: Yeah, she's had a little bit too much. - Oh, I know what you mean. - Yes, lovely, sorry. - Where's the camera? - The camera's downstairs - I gave it to Damien. - I'll leave you too - to it then, okay. - Thanks a lot. - Speak to you soon. - Right. All right then, all we gotta do... - Yes? - Is open the hatch. - Yes? - Get the film out, expose it and ruin it. Oh for goodness sake, Peter, you can't be serious. Yeah, I am serious. But they stopped using film ages ago. You're just being ridiculous. Okay, so what do we do? Well I think you have to get a little cassette thingy out and unravel it or something? Where from? Well I don't know, well have a look in the back. There's no hatch, it's almost like it's been melted, - fused shut. - Oh! All the buttons are too small. I mean look at it, it looks like the sort of thing you can float around the universe in. Who invented it, aliens? Nothing, you can get a finger or anything at all. It's almost like you need a pen to poke it. Well have you got a pen or better still a screwdriver? Hang on, no, but we could get a screwdriver. - Okay. - Better still, we could get a big screwdriver. Leave the bugger open. - Right, come on then. - Come on, let's go. Oh, I think we should leave the camera up here. - Good idea. - Can we hide it somewhere? The table, right. Come on, let's go. Got a toolkit in the study, right. (GUESTS TALKING) (STAIRS CREAKING) (GUESTS TALKING) Mike. It is quite clear to me that you don't have the hairy little balls to just come out and tell me that I haven't got the job. I know your sort. All mouth and no trousers. Well I'm not having it. Not going to have it. No, none of it, I tell you, none of it. You can oh You can (MOANS) You can take your stupid job and your stupid Jenny and your stupid party and your stupid house and shove it right up your stupid asshole and I am not clearing that up. (GROANS) (MUSIC BOOMING) (GUESTS TALKING) Ooh. (CRASHES ON STAIRS) Oh shit, Rosalind, Rosalind. Oh she had too much to drink. - You okay? - Help me up with her. - You okay? - Yeah, ready. - Got her. - Right, okay. Take her down there, put her on there, get her some water or something. All right, no time for you. - You're all right. - Come on. (GROANS) Watch your head, - watch your... - Ooh. - Oh, oh. - There you are.

(GUESTS SCREAMING) Get away, get away from the thing. That's ours, I mean cranky bugger, okay, take a little time to get the top off. - I'll have that thank you. - He said he'd give me 10 grand to smash the camera with his Range Rover. Give it here and we'll all split it. - No thank you. - Damn. Mike, I'm really sorry about what I said earlier. I was just upset and so upset... If you want something done, do it yourself. (STATIC FIZZLES) Ooh, I can't open it, it's like the both of us no. - Give it. - Will you stop everybody? Have that Andy, take the camera. Right now, all of you, what is going on? Mike. Mike. Colleague, friend. We've been partners now for what 15 years, trust me, please, let me have the camera. - Oh no. - Michael, Michael let him have the camera. Michael, listen to your mother. I'd give that camera over now Mike. Michael, I am your doctor, my professional opinion is that the camera must be given to John. No no no Mike, there's something on there you really got to see. Damien fuck off! What's going on? Boss, is there any chance? Nicky, shut up. I'm not gonna get that job now am I? Will someone tell me what the F is going on? Michael, I've been shagging your wife for six months. (GUESTS SHOUTING) - Shut up! - Bitch! - You shut up. - Michael, Michael! Your mother's dying. She's not your mother, I'm sorry. What? Perhaps we should talk about the job thing later. I'm still free on Thursday. No, no Mike, you're not. You're out. You'll be in New York on the 23rd. That's when we sign the papers. I'm sorry mate, it's just business. HELEN: Yes, sorry Mike. - (NICK CLEARS THROAT) - Nick? I'm on there having a wank in your own suite. - Oh Jesus. - Oh no. I'm sorry, boss please, don't fire me. I've been bumping off prices for years, nothing personal I do it to everyone. And that Gambol portrait in your study? - Mm? - Is shit. Real shit. It's my shit. - (GUESTS EXCLAIMING) - God. - Oh God. - That's disgusting. - Number two. - Did it with my hands. - Oh. - Jesus Christ. I have something to say. The breasts you grew were not the result of a thyroid problem. I was supposed to give you betasolipene. Instead I gave you betasolipene. I'm so sorry. But they sound the same. I know. That was the problem. Say bethasolibede. Betasolipene. Right, now say pathosolimene. Betasolipene. Sorry mate. You grew breasts? Yeah, they're going now, but... Oh, oh, you're not a fat old fart. It just we are just jealous women and Jenny is really lucky to have found you. Isn't that right girls? Why did you have to say that? Because everyone is making their confessions. Yes, but that wasn't on camera. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Right, I just don't believe this. Can I mention at this point that the vol-au-vents were made of cat food? - Oh. - God. - Oh God. - Oh my God. (GUESTS WRETCHING) Oh dear God. (GUESTS WRETCHING) - Ooh. - Oh my God. - (BATTERY BEEPING) - I'm sorry Mike, but I think the battery is about to run out. (BEEPS) (BEEPS) (CAMERA WHINES) (SIGHS) (COMPUTER BEEPING) What?
