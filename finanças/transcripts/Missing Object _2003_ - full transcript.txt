THE LOST STUFF Based on the short story of the same name Hello! Hello! Have we arrived yet? Watch your step! Hello! Thank you so much for your help. This is my sister. Tell her to choose a random chessman. Here it is. I don't understand. You will meet a person that you want to meet. Planning a flower plant on purpose but the flower didn't bloom. Just randomly plant a willow tree, then it grew beautifully. Poor me! He has just run away. Thank you! Give me the cigarette pack! Wait for me. Hello! Is it Thao? I thought that was an officer from the ministry. I has just poured my rice wine away. I'm sorry. Today, I took my husband and my kid... ... here to visit Mr. Thang. We've just come back. It's my gift for you. Thank you! Meeting Mr. Thang is a good choice. Come in please! Come in please! Come in please! Mr. Thang, we will be back next week. I know that you're off today... ... so I took my husband and my kid here to thank you. You! Thank you for your kindness! It's nothing! Because of you, we have today. Is he sleeping? Yes. Huyen... She didn't believe that you saved me. We wish you warm. You... take the wine out. Could we drink together? You are... Thank you! - Cheers! - Cheers! Huyen! My sister told me... ... that you felt down from the sky, is it true? Mr.? Lost and Found My name is Duong Thang. I am a math teacher. On 9th November, when I was crossing a crossroad where there was an Indian almond tree, I found a bag of money. Who lost this bag money please contact me at Room 3, D6, Hanoi University. I am Duong Thang. I am a math teacher. On 9th November when I was crossing a crossroad where there was an Indian almond tree, I found a bag of money. Who lost this bag money please contact me at Room 3, D6, Hanoi University. Do I have to be your husband? I can't ask anyone else for help. Only you can save me. Hey! You two, come here! Who is the father of the baby that Thao is carrying? Yes, it's me. That's me. Shut up! How's your homework? Please sit down! Today, according to your request, I will spend this class to review. Because we will have the final test in two days. I will try to sum up all the topics in 15 questions. It's too much! Teacher! Can you be more specific? Only one question please! One question please! Of cource, we will have our focus but test is test. You are looking him like you want to eat him up. It's not your business. I love him. Why are you late? You're so beautiful! The test is coming but she is still that lazy. I'm glad to be your instructor. This is a united and loving class. When I marked your works, I found 8 pairs of works which I can see no differences. Foe example, the works of Mr. Tran Van Thuong and Ms. Ngo Thi Ngoc. Today is the last class of your subject. Today is a very special day. Because all of us like you so much. - That's right! - Tomorrow afternoon, we will hold a party before the final test. And you will be the only teacher that we will invite and you will have to be there. Be good! Nho! Give me the dress! Yes! What do you think about Mr. Thang? He is the idol of women like you. I am Duong Thang. I am a math teacher. On 9th November, when I was crossing a crossroad where there was an Indian almond tree, I found a bag of money. Who lost this bag money please contact me at Room 3, D6, Hanoi University. Which is the crossroad where there is an Indian almond tree? - What's wrong with you? - I'm okay. I will have left by tomorrow, I want to ask you something. You are being silly! I will take care of your Mr. Thang in the most special way of girls now. Is it okay? Huyen! I don't know why but I've just had a flash back about what the old man said on the other day. - Hello Dad! - Is Mom home? She went to the pagoda. I think she wouldn't be home before the afternoon. Let me help you. Hello! - Say hi to your grandpa! - Hello! What are you cooking? They smells so good! I am cooking some special treats for Thao and her husband. Can you tell if I'm better than Mom or not? I know what you are up to. - Dad! - Someone is calling you. Hello! Yes! Where are you? Let me ask Nho to open the gate for you. I have to directly open the gate for you? What if I won't? You can wait there! If you don't go out, I will wait here till tomorrow. What's your mother called you? Is this "God bless"? Yes, it is. Who has just called you, Huyen? It's Duong! He just helped me find a job and now he wants me to directly open the gate for him. You changed 4 jobs in six months. Good job! Duong is one of my favorite students. Go open the gate for him! Here you are! Here's the key! Hand this project to your father. I have to go now. It will be better if you give him by yourself. I am sorry. Who said that I was afraid of my wife? Forget it! Put some garlic there! Teacher! You can use it! Sorry! Teacher! Drink with me! You have to be drunk with me today. I'm so happy because my wife and my kids have already been on a vacation in Nha Trang for a week. Now I am the master. You shouldn't drink that much when you can't. I am not used to drink in the morning like this. Let me make a noodle for you. No, I won't eat now. Hanh! I have to go now. I have to go pick Hung up. Teacher! Teacher! We won't keep you here. But it's our small gift for you. - Please take it! - No! I won't take it! Everyone! Mr. Thang is leaving! Everyone! Mr. Thang is leaving! Teacher! You can't leave now! If you want to go, you have to step over my body. That's right! Stay with us! Ah! I caught you! Miss! Can I ask you something? Excuse me! Can I ask you something? Are you Duong Thang? Yes! I need your help. I get it! Is that about the bad result of your kid? No. I want to talk about something else. I dropped a bag of money on September 9th, November. What? I dropped a bag of money. I dropped a bag of money. My bag of money has ac cube shape. You are so careless. Yes, can you give me my bag of money back? Who told you that I found your bag of money? I saw your message on TV. I watch TV 7 hours per day. I even know every words of the funeral announcements. But I didn't find your bag of money. Come on! It's my saving money. I am a bank accountant. It took me a lot of time to save that amount of money. I have that amount of money is because during nine years before my retirement, I was the employee of the year. To be honest, my last beef noodles was three years ago. I didn't find your bag of money. Why don't you believe me? If we don't trust your generation, who can we trust? So who do we trust? It's not my business. In short, you should trust me. Because the one dropped the money will be the one who is telling the truth. Maybe I found a wallet. - But... - That's right! It's mine. Only people who are honest and careful like us use that kind of wallet. But an old man, older than you came here to take it back. So I gave him. Why did you give him? I sent my message to the broadcast. So I will give it to anyone coming here. You are being fool! There are many people out there; although they are old but they aren't honest. Maybe I had dropped it somewhere else. Yes! I'm sorry. It seems like you have to wait for me. I like it. Have a good morning! And here are the flowers from the bottom of my heart. You can find Da Lat rose anytime of the year in Hanoi now. If you are mentioning its season, its season is over. What's wrong with you? What can I help you? Yes. What's wrong with you? Duong! Can you give up the project that you are partnering with my father? I've read it. The article is right. Your company is a private company. You guys don't have enough capability to work on this project. Why do you have to care about our business? Hello! It's Duong. Have you invited all the project's partner to the meeting? Okay? I will be there in 30 minutes. It's hurt! Take your hands off! Hello Teacher! Yes, hello! Maybe you won't recognize me. I came to your place one time with Thao. Yes. Hello Dung! I'm Huyen! Can I talk to you in that place? Hello Teacher! I will have an orange juice. But I want to invite you some wine. Yes. My sister, Thao, has just left this morning. She and her husband want me to visit you. What's your relationship with Thao? My mother is Thao's mother's younger sister. It makes sense. Because you and Thao doesn't look like real sisters. My father said that I was too different. Mister, do you want to clean your shoes? Please! Go away! Why do your students call you "weird" Thang? You have a house out here. Why do you have to live like a single life inside the university? Who usually ask why will always fail at Philosophy. Is that true? Where did you go? It's really difficult to find you. Some of my employees have just come back from abroad training. Yeah, but I am so hungry now. Do you have anything to eat? Would you like Vietnamese food or Western food? Whatever. Let me call some Vietnamese food. There's a girl I recently met. She's just opened a restaurant. And she's hot. Eating her food and thinking about her makes me excited. We have to find you because of this project. Part 3 and 4 need your expertise. Hello! Is that My Lan Restaurant? Who told you that? We saw it on TV. We saw your announcement, we were feeling so bless. We've come here many times but you weren't at home. Yes, that's right. Please open the door. Let me help you. Open the door! Your house looks so simple. Yes. Honest people can't be rich. You live like this but you still want to turn back the money you accidently found. Your children will be bless. How does your bag of money look like? Ah, it's a fabric bag. The fabric was from a monk's custom in Huong pagoda. God bless us. Because it's money for the pagoda, it can't be lost. But, the other day, an old man came here to take it back. What? Don't give it to him! He's not the owner. He's not the owner. He said the money belonged to him. So I had to give it back. Where does he live? I don't know. What? You thought that we were children? You thought that we knew nothing? A man like you can't be that careless. Yes. What are you saying? You want to keep it, don't you? Hey, it's the charity money of the pagoda. It's not the money from nowhere. I swear that I didn't find anything. Are you denying? You are talking differently. Hey, do your dare to swear? Do you dare? Let's go! Let's go with me! Go now! Hey, kneel down! Say it! I am Duong Thang. I swear that all my life I have never found anything that people left. If I lie, please cut my tounge. Mr. Teacher! Mr. Teacher! Please forgive us! You freaked us out. If you didn't found our bag of money, then we are sorry. Okay. Hey, we don't have anything else. Please take it. We feel really uncomfortable for misunderstanding you. Hey, take them. No. We have to go now. Just take them. Here's the thing. I also have some money. Let me contribute to the missing money of the pagoda. You are so kind. I don't know. Are you calling me? I am ironing your mother's clothes. Nho! - Yes. - Bring me a bottle of wine and a cup. What? The bottle of wine. But your father has so many of them. You can take whatever you want. Yes. I don't know why there are people like that kind of men. I am talking about the seven variable points. However, on my research I mentioned mostly about singularities at infinity. Sorry, I have run out of time of the morning. We will continue this presentation in the afternoon. Relevant topics... Object! We still have time! We still have time. Let him present. As the president I repeat that we should go too far from our topic. The singularity theory of Mathematics is not somewhere to contain mislead ideas of philosophy. Thang! Thang! Congratulations! Here is he. Hello and congratulations! At the end, most talents stay at singularities. Yes. Are you Thang? - Yes. - You are great. - Hello! - You are a talent and brave man. Please sign here. - Congratulations! - Thank you! - Congratulations! - Thank you! You forgot about your pants' zip again. Damn! *French* Thang! I don't think that you dare to come back here. You can fire me from the institute. But you can't fire me from Mathematics. You are getting me wrong. I want you to present at another Mathematics conference. It will be better for you. Hello! Where is D6? Are you going to Mr. Thang's house? Yes. Why do you want to go there? - Would you like a cigarette? - Yes. I want to talk with him privately. What's your name? Listen to me. You're the 17th person coming here. I haven't counted people I couldn't see yet/ I am the real one. If I didn't drop that bag, why do I have to come here? What's your name? Let me ask my wife. A man like you, a teacher a scientist. But you let people gossiping about you. What? That all kind of people come to meet you. You are in huge debts. Why don't you tell me? Is this Mr. "weird" Thang class? Infinity weird. He won't check attendance. Let's go! Hey! Where are they going? Maybe they are going to sell cigarettes. The school office is having a meeting about the problem that recently, many people came to Mr. Thang's house. They came for his debt. What's going on? Mr. Thang is watched by the police. Everyone! Teacher! Hands off! Remember? I'm sorrry for being late. I've lost my bag. There's a lot of money in my bag. Could I ask you something? Okay. Now I have to count them from the start again. Could you check the news on November 9th? The news about someone founded a bag of money. Who sent you that news? The person who founded that bag of money. But what's his name? Why? So... To know. Sit down. I'm busy. Bring this tape to the Program Department. Let's see. Note it down! November 9th. Tran Linh Thu Huyen. Identity... I've came to dad's office to find you. People said that you were here. I know. I want to talk with you privately. Sit down! I've just known that the project is facing problems. I already have an expert to rewrite it. I don't want my father to be involved in those dirty works. Do you understand? You trust your dad completely, don't you? Delete pictures we took together in that disc! You're different lately. Will you give up that project? No, never. It's hot! Are you insane? It's over. Sorry! Sorry! Hello Teacher! Yes. Why are you here? Why are you here? I have a friend here. Goodbye! Take them! They are waiting for you. - Is this Thang? - Yes. Has Phuong still come here to cook for you? Today is the 15th of the month, maybe she is going to the market to buy something. Maybe in the next few days, I will come here with you again. The other day, Phuong cooked some fish porridge and brought for you. But you weren't home. Phuong told me that you were in trouble. Is that true? Give me your hand! Looks like the negative is taking dominance. Did you meet any women? Getting married is one in three events of your life. You are the elder son of the family. You shouldn't ignore that. Do you want me to ask something for you? I don't know what to ask. Just think about what you want to know with all your heart. One head. Same! Two head. All three of them are head. You got some thing bad. Some bad people are haunting you. You should wait to right time. You should temporarily hide your intelligence, your braveness, and your clever if you want to be peaceful. You have talent. You should think about this. Thang! Wait me here. Attention! Alarm! Keep calm and find a shelter! Mom! Mom! Where are you going? Hello! Hello! You will be the last one putting your vote into this box. Here's your vote form. Ah yes, thank you. Thank you! Who should I choose? The above one or the below one? Just choose who is better. The neighborhood people said that you hadn't gone out of your house for over 20 years. Is that true? Yes, ancient people said that... Professor Thang! Rice wine, boiled peanut, stir fried vegetable! Hurry up! Hello! Come back! Mr. Thang's table, two more cups, two more bowls, and two more chopsticks. Hello! Alone again? Would you like to clean your shoes, sir? No. Thach is the vice CEO. Hello! Thang is a well-known theoretical expert in your field. Do you usually drink rice wine? I am not bothering anyone. Cheers! Talent people are the vitality of a nation. The rice wine here is so good. Where's your hometown? My father is an Hanoian. But I was born at the evacuated place. You are not wearing warm enough. Do you have bear bile wine? Please go to the next door pho restaurant and order for me a half of a boiled chicken and a dish of colon eggs. Hurry up! Okay! As I told you before, Thach is a manager so he is very busy. He doesn't have time to write this master's thesis. He will provide you all the data you need. And you, you will have to write 85 pages. I will take care of logistics issues. Do you want some pig brain? Are you implying us? You're ruined some of his ideas. I've heard that in your university you are famous for being a gentleman. Yes. Peolple also said that I received certificates every year in birth control. You thought it was good? You agreed. Hesitating people like you can't never be rich. Who found the new model of the project? I'm sorry. We're all polite people and we know each other. Can I borrow a motorbike in two days? Give me my guitar back! Give me my guitar back! Duc's table. He started singing. Towel, hot water, bucket, coal slag! What are you asking for? The next house broke their toilet. Is this Tran Linh Thu Huyen's house? She and her parents have gone out. What's the relationship between you and her? I worked for her as a maid. Who are you? Where are you coming from? When she comes back, I will tell her. I will come back later Okay. She's used to be home late. Can you come back tomorrow? What are you doing? So careless! What are you doing? So careless! Let's go! Are you checking out girls? You will die some days driving like that. So careless! Why do you have to yell at him that hard? Hanh! Hanh! Hello! Come in! Are you alone? Hung went to his father house. Come in! It's cold out there. It's locked. I have to use mosquito net. There are so many mosquitoes here. Do you want some noodles? I don't want to eat. Do you want some wine? Besides our class, do you teach anywhere else? No. Even if I have to pay tax for doing Maths, I will still do it. But recently, I feel so useless. Goodbye. What's wrong with you? I'm okay. My mother told me she saw you. She said that you had never changed. You are always so bewildered. She's right. I asked her what about me. She cried. She said that how we could know that Hung's father would be in prison for 10 years. Hanh! Hanh! Hanh! Wait for me! Wait for me! Go home! If people saw us together, it would cause me problems. But I don't understand. You don't understand many things. Your teacher fired you from the institute. You also told me that you didn't understand. No one owns Mathematics. One day, you and your mother will understand. Ask yourself! Back then, I could still handle my feelings when your mother evicted me. But when you didn't want me to be there, I knew that I lost. It's not true. Stay here with me! Are you looking down on me? I have to go. Goodbye! It's black out again. Wait for me. I will light up a candle. Who did you hire to build the new model of the project? Is that him? Do you know that your friend is making mistakes and researching on the singularity theory alone? I know. I want his draft. Both you and I know Thang. I am a businessman. But I never thought that I will betray my friend. You are taking it too serious. Thang needs to publish his research. I will attend an Mathematics international conference in Belgium. I want to help him. He is a son of a fallen hero. Why don't you knock the door? I'm sorry. Why did Huyen know that Thang wrote the project? It's impossible. Check it. She directly told me. You shouldn't get her involve in this project. She is young and frivolity. You bribed too careless. Yes. Carefully! Tie him in! If he wake up, it will be a mess. It's horible! They are real doctors. Do you remember Professor Binh? He's Kien Course 23's father. This is him. Kien said that his father was a dean of a faculty. Yes, he is. He can earn more doing this. Knowledge is valuable now. Here you are. Yes. Here's your money. Thank you! Here you are! Put it in the rice wine! Ah! It's your 10cc. Injecting, drinking, or mixing with wine they are all fine. Thank you! Here's your money. Follow this instruction. Okay? Okay. Bye! This thing is good in curing your grandfather's back. Let's find something to eat. Then I will take you to your grandfather's house. You are generous in spending recently. Just this kind of wine is the lowest lever of people have talents like us. Beer, please! Yes! It's fast! Ten years ago, we were doing our graduation thesis. We both had many ambition. Now we are just in the same place. What's the relationship between you and Professor Dao? It's the same. Who's right? You or him? In science, there's no right or wrong? We just have the truth. Hello! It's Duong! Hello! Is Professor in Ho Chi Minh City now? Awesome! Yes... yes... yes... yes! Thank you! We have to avoid giants. Both your father and mine taught us that, Thang! You have everything now. I don't have people like you. When you finish your research, let my people save it in disc for you. Okay. Turn the TV on, please! Recently, in the market there are some kind of toilets having Monaco brand. They're manufactured by Thanh Tri porcelain company. The company belongs to Viglacera. So are you thinking that only older people deserve to watch TV? I am watching this interview. Go overthere! Calm down! Sit down, please! Let me tell the foreign girl to come here and talk with you. Do you like her? I prefer wine rather than human. We just want to drink. Is this okay if I park my car out there? I am Nguyen Hoan. I have a master in model poetry. Your place is romantic, the view is very poetic. Most poet lived in small house. But their heart is endless. Wine! It's okay. But I'm sure that all poet like wine. I've never written any poems. I don't believe it. And I've never found any bag of money. Then I still don't believe it. As well-educated people, we should be honest to each other. Okay. I'm busy. I've just come back from a business trip. Yes. I will make an announcement through TV and the press. It will be the thank you note for you from me and Model Poetry Research Center. It will state clearly that I have received all the money you found. Thank you. In fact, I just need 80% of that amount. What do you think? I know that you are a Math teacher. Who said that there was no poetic in Mathematics? What? Don't you believe me? Yes, Mr. Master of... I'm exhausted now. Could you please leave? I... I don't get it. The other day, there was a man coming for you. What? Have you met him? What are you doing? Did she steal your purse? Why do you give her money? Here you are. Thank you. Your parents told me to pick you up. Are you pretending not to understand what I said? I'm sorry. Our parents will know about everything during this dinner. Thank you. What? Nho, call me a cab. Yes. You always want me to go with you during my English class. Which bar do you want to go now? It's boring. What about a dance club? It's too early for a dance club. What about a hotel? Nothing new about it. Bye! Mr. Hung has just got sick. So I will be in charge of this class today. My name is Duong Thang. Teacher! May I come in? Please speak in French. *French* Yes, please sit down. We will study chapter 24 today. Who throw trash here? I will speak first. After this class, I want to meet you. Yes. *French* Why did you announce that I found a bag of money? Dad! This is... I know this man. Why didn't put on some more clothes? It's cold. I'm not cold. Mr. Thang! I... I want to tell you something. What do you want to say? Just say it. I... Thang! Why don't you stay in your car? I have to go now. Professor Thang! A cup, a bowl, a pair of chopsticks. Your shoes are dirty. Thang's table! More cups, more bowls, more chopsticks! I want to sit here alone. I will be totally silent. Shut up! Stop singing! You are making my head hurt! Stop drinking! You have to go home! I didn't find anything! I don't want to find anything! It's your retirement announcement. I don't need two copies. You are keeping too many documents. It's the profile of Thang. Give me all of them! Wait! Give me back that thing! I have an appointment with him today. Come in, please! Please take a seat! Yes. Hello! Hello! You have six complaints. Especially, one of them is from M.A. Nguyen Hoan. He's from the Model Poetry Research Center. He sent it to all the legal organization and press. The content is about you found his money. Could you please stay here with us? I've heard you the whole last afternoon. Come closer! You have to understand that this is a mistake of the board. It's all a mistake of the Federation and the Women Organization. You have been treated well to live in D6. Object! The young generation needs to be on our shoulder. Thang is doing research about Mathematics. I don't agree with you about taking his house. The honor day of your father and two more friends of me. I will make something specials at night. Yes. Have you got my book? I'm so lucky! We only have two of them left. Tet holiday is near. Why do you need so many books? Excuse me! Excuse me! Do you speak French? Yes. I don't understand this part. Could you please explain it for me? I'm sorry! My mistake! Wrong room! How can you get into my house? I follow your instructions. The key is hid in the old place. I don't want water, I want some wine. For real. Good wine and beautiful woman. It's not difficult to explain when you found a bag of money. You are wasting your money. Who are you? November 9th, after robbing someone, I dropped all that money. The wall is the end. I don't have anything back there. Where's the money? In my house, there's no lock in all closets. Robbery! There's still some wine left in the bottle. It's a waste! Keep silence! Tonight... Do you have any wine left? What's happening, Thang? We are having a meeting! This girl broke the glass bottle. Hey, man! What's your name? Follow him! Thang should get married. That's right. I... I am the silliest girl in Hanoi. Thang... Please forgive me! I heard that you got sick. Goodbye! Hanh! Hanh! Who's she? Hey, man! Why are you standing here? I dropped my lighter into the river. Do you want a cigarette? No, thank you. Do you have a lighter? - Thank you! - Are you writing a poem? No, I've never written any poems. You look like an artist without beard. They usually have long hair and beard. You look tired, you should go home. People said that you shouldn't risk your health. What kind of people is he? Who knows? Come in, please! Bastard! Where's my money? Hurry up! Stop there! Stop there! He owns me! Liar! Fuck off! - Is it hurt? - Yes, it is. Are you looking for me? Let me take you home! No, I have a class today. Thang! I forgot to tell you that Huyen and I are being in a relationship. It's yours. You're wrong about me. He's tough and wise. That's the reasonable price for your information. About his personal relationships, that's not my business. Wait! Give this to him. This is the Mathematics research he wants. The waste processing in Hanoi old quarters project is an idea that I've kept for many years. Now it's been realized by the contributions of many scientists. Part 3 and part 4 of the project have the best economical solutions. Those make the project standout. The unique point is economical in the most efficient way. Last question, professor. You are now working as a manager. But you are still researching. Can you tell us about that research? As I mentions, the waste processing project is only one example of applying science. About my own research, the singularity Mathematics theory in limited singularity points is a basic rearch that I've been following for the whole life. I will publish it in the next Mathematics conference in Belgium. May you succeed! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye, professor! Goodbye! Why do you come here? I went to the pagoda to find Mom. But she's not there so I came here. You look tired today. You said that you knew Thang. How's he? I thought you wanted to ask something else. Thang, he has talent but he also has too much hesitation. He can't do anything. But in the project, he wrote the most important parts. I know it better than you. Where are you going? I'm going to see the fortuneteller, I want to know everything. Are you going to ask about your love life again? Why don't you ask me? Don't you trust me anymore? You are being like your mother. She is the only one I love. So I've never been confused. I have to go now. The project has been approved. Congratulations! You made me wait for so long! All the modern computers can't compare to him. I will come back here after the Tet holiday. Hello! Hello! I am Thao's sister. Hello! Hello, I want to talk to Huyen. She's not home. Tell her that Duong called. Yes, I will tell her. You look sad. Do you want me to take you home? No, I want to drink. Hello! Hello! Duong is finding you. He just wants the project. Why did you broadcast the news that Thang found a bag of money? I don't know why. Where's my mother? She has gone to the flower market. What about my father? He's upstairs. Huyen, do you know who this Mathematics research belongs to? Is it Thang? It shows paranoia, mental illness, and arrogance. And it's really weird. You know that I have many students. Among them, Thang is nothing. He's trash. You are an adult now. Don't let me to mention this problem again. He's pretending to be a silly man. Mr. Thang! Mr. Thang is here. Mr. Thang! Where are you going? We all passed. - We all passed. - Thank you! Let me give you a kiss! We won a victory. Thank you! That's right! - Here's for you! - Thank you! We have a party again. We would like to invite only you. Only you! I'm afraid I can't go today. Tet holiday is near. Teacher! Don't let me lay down here again! Why's so serious? Thang! Give me your room's key! I still left it at the tree in front of my room. Sign here. It's an important document. Don't sign it! If you sign it, you can't be a teacher any more. That's right! Don't sign it! Come here with me! Huyen came to my house to find you. She has just gone. She's gone long before. Thang was here finding her. I know that I can find you here. This crossroad... Is that the crossroad which have an Indian almond tree? I find you because I wanted to give you a purse that someone dropped. So that's real? Yes, I found it. I gave you. So you can pay people you need to pay.
