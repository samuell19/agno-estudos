Dear. - Yes. Come here. What's this? A dress for you on this festival of Eid. Gorgeous! You're looking like a newly-wed bride. - Don't... Wear it for some more time. I couldn't see you wearing these clothes at your wedding, because I wasn't there. Let me see you now. I'll slap you. My nephew is absolutely correct. Why are you scolding him? Greetings Mr. Maruti! Come in. - Greetings! You really look wonderful! Keep it here. Even your wife is beautiful. - That's what I'm saying. Look at my kid. He looks like his mother. What are you saying? - Quiet! God has tattooed my complexion on his sole. If he would've taken after my complexion even by mistake, we had to make the mark twice to prevent bad luck! A black mark is very auspicious. Auspicious? His soles have wheels. He moves so quickly! I'll always cherish this day. No one would forget such an auspicious day. Maruti, are you in Mumbai now? I have a good hold over Mumbai. The train won't move until I reach the station. Give some to brother too. Have some, brother. It's time to leave for duty. I'll go with you too. - Yes! Eat quickly! Wrap him tight. You promised to take me. - I'll take you! We'll leave to catch our train. - So early? I'll drop her to Kolhapur and leave for Mumbai. I'll leave you at the bus stop. Bye, dear. - Bye. Come son. Good bye, sister! - Good bye, sister! Welcome, sir. Congratulations on your release after 10 long years. Just one garland? Where's the second one? - Second? The other garland that I was supposed to offer Salma? Why are you quiet? It's too late. Salma... - What happened? Salma got married after you were jailed. No! She can't get married to someone else. It would be my defeat and I've never learnt to accept defeat. Recognize me? - Zafar? Did you think I would never return from jail that you got your daughter married to someone else? We learnt your true colours. You're a murderer! You've cheated people of millions! I did all that for your daughter. And you got her married to a beggar! Listen! You still have a chance. Get her divorced and married to me. Married to you? Impossible! I'd kill my daughter, rather than getting her married to a devil like you. I'll kill your son-in-law and forcefully take Salma away. No, I won't let that happen. Move! - Zafar! Zafar, it's a sin! At least fear God. I am God, I'm not scared of any other God. Let's go, Goga. Allah Rakha. You have been with us since years Now the safety of our family is in your hands is all on you. Deliver this message to Salma. Fly away! You? Why are you here? To take Salma whom I was to marry 10 years ago. Have some shame. I'm a married woman. I don't follow the rules of society. The world knows I acquire what I want. I'm stubborn by birth. How many doors will you close? I'll break open all the doors of the world. Be afraid of God and His wrath. Neither do I believe in God, nor His wrath. I'm a disaster for the one who doesn't listen to me. Wait, Zafar! I'll make this fire a pyre for you. Don't be a fool. Look at his hut. I'll keep you in a palace and bathe you in gems. For an Indian woman like me, a husband's house is a palace, this scarf she wears is as good as silk and the dust of my husband's feet is more than your gems. Really? What if I kill your husband? There'll be two dead bodies lying here, one, my husband's and mine. Get out or I'll call the entire neighbourhood. They'll drive you out after a good thrashing. Good. I'm leaving this place right now, but I'll leave this city only with my Salma. What's the matter, Allahrakha? He's the one. Dad! Dad! Let me go. Dad! Dad! Oh God. Mom! Goga! Mother! Take us too! Get lost! Apply a black mark on him once you reach Kolhapur. Stop! Why did you stop the cart? Can't you see the water ahead? It's risky to proceed. He's correct, let's not go. Don't get scared by his warnings. We'll miss the bus. Take Rs. 20 and let's go. C'mon! Move! - They only want money. No, please listen to me. My son! Save my son. Parvati! - Save my son. My son! Parvati! - Help! Parvati! My son! My son! Save my son. Parvati! Mom! I'm an orphan now. I have no one now! God, in spite of Your presence, you made me an orphan. Uncle! You lost everything, so did I. We have to support each other. Let's go. The accident has left her traumatised. She has lost her speech. Can she never speak? Did she have a child? - Yes, but... Get him. We can't treat her unless he's here. How can we find her child? - I'm sorry. It's necessary to get her child. Doctor! - Coming! But doctor... Why are you worried? We'll get a kid somehow. Today's breaking news! America created a hydrogen bomb! Aeroplanes are on a 7 day strike. Today's breaking news! Uncle Rahim! It's a one-day journey... When you reach... - Hello, Uncle Rahim. Greetings, son. Are you going to Ajmer Sharif? - No. Today's breaking news. America... - Hey, paper boy. Today's... Are you going to Ajmer Sharif? - No! Sir, be seated. I'll be back with change. - Okay. Bob, I've established a chit fund office for you in Mumbai too. - Okay. But make sure my name doesn't appear in these matters. Understand? Come. Sir. Sir. Madam, are you going to Ajmer? Will you offer a sacred sheet at the shrine? Pray that I get my mom back. Mother! Mom, where were you? This is my mom! I'm her son, Iqbal! - Get out! Get out! - Let go of me! Mother! Nurse, bring the child. - Yes, sir. Madam, this is your son. Get out! What happened? Thank God, Salma lost her memory, or this boy would've taken her away. Do I kill him? - Kill him. Mom! C'mon, silly kid! Stand still. Bob! - Let go! Mother! Mom! Leave me! Mom! Don't go away, mom, I'm your son, Iqbal. Don't leave me! For God's sake, don't leave me! I'm your son! Stop, mother! For God's sake, don't leave me! Stop, mother! Don't leave! I'm your son. Why don't you speak, mom? Don't leave me! Mother! Leave me! Uncle! You scoundrel! Uncle! Don't worry, uncle, I'm your right hand from today. We'll share all our troubles! Allahrakha, both of us will take care of porters from now on. Porter! Come. Hurry up! Quickly! You dropped the dog! I am sorry Sir. Good-for-nothing rascal You dropped my dog. Fool! Sir, why are you beating a porter? What's the matter, uncle? Oh look he is bleeding. Sir, you can't beat them up like this. How dare you touch me! Don't move! I'll suspend you! I'm the member of the railway advisory board. You thrashed our colleague and we... Don't you dare move or else I'll shoot. What can you do? What's the matter, Allahrakha? Really? Let's see. Who are you? Open the window for a while. My introduction is very lengthy. I've the blessings of God right from childhood, and I've got Allahrakha with me. I've got badge no.786, I smoke cigar no.20, I'm a porter and my name is... - Iqbal! The one whom I hit on the head, becomes bald. What do you want? A worker should get his wages before his sweat dries. But he got a thrashing. It's better that you apologize to him. Never. No? Think about it. If a porter, who lifts others' burdens becomes a burden on you, you'll have a tough time. Seems you'll leave only after a good fight. Where will I go? The railway platform is our home. What say, brothers? - Yes! These are the guests. - Yes. So house owners will... - Stay back! And guests... - Will leave! What say, brother? Would you like to try? Allarakha, watch the fun. - Come. Don't you dare! Move away! Police! - Catch him! Arrest him. Sir, please arrest the bearded man. Not at all Leave me! What have I done? He did everything! Me? - Yes! One minute! Leave me. Sir, our presence doesn't create a fuss. But a fuss is created if we're absent. Do you want to see how? Strike! Strike! Hello, sir. Why did you stop the train? To register a complaint. A complaint? The chairman's son hit an old porter, he's in the hospital. We raised a voice, but the police arrested our leader, Iqbal. Please give us justice. PA! - Yes! Call a board meeting and call their leader too. - Yes sir! I'll investigate this. A board member is the culprit, how will you investigate? Spare time for the poor as well. You have no idea how we live in pain, in tears. No one listens to the poor! They apply bandages to dogs, but for us, they have no balm, no bandage, no provident fund or hospitals. We shoulder the burden of the world but no one shoulders our burden. We've reached a conclusion, that the mistake is yours, Mr. Puri. What? - You have to apologize to him. Do I have to say sorry to him? No! Well then, please resign. He has heart trouble. A person without a heart can't have heart disease. It's epilepsy. Smell my shoes! Stop that nonsense! See, it's neither heart disease, nor epilepsy. Quiet! I'd rather resign than apologize to him! There he goes. Mr. Puri has resigned. Can you call off the strike? As you wish, sir. When I say it's over, it's over. "Porter!" "Porter!" "We lift the weight of the entire world." "We lift the weight of the entire world." "We lift it." "We lift the weight of the entire world." "People arrive and depart," "but we remain here." "We lift the weight of the entire world." Idiot! - I'm not idiot, I'm Iqbal. Wow! I think God has created you giving special instructions to angels. Shameless! You ruined my dress! Your dress is ruined but... your face is blooming... like a rose. - Let's go, porter. "You give a one-time charge for work by four." "You give a one-time charge for work by four." "Don't suck our blood." "Or take away something else." "You have paid one rupee less." "I swear on God that we work really hard." "We lift the weight of the entire world." "We lift the weight of the entire world." "We quench our hunger and thirst, having water and praying to God." "We quench our hunger and thirst, having water and praying to God." "We work in each and every situation." "We enjoy one holiday, on the festival of Eid." "We lift the weight of the entire world." "We lift the weight of the entire world." "Our life is difficult," "even we have a heart." "We are humans and we have aspirations too." "Our life is difficult," "even we have a heart." "We are humans and we have aspirations too." "When we are sad, we enjoy." "When we are sad, we enjoy," "smoke a cigar and eat betel leaves." "We lift the weight of the entire world" "People arrive and depart," "but we remain here itself." "We lift the weight of the entire world." "We lift the weight of the entire world." Here you go! Mom, this is my last application for a job. If I don't get a reporter's job, I'll start selling newspapers. Mr.Sunny, Mr.Iyengar is calling you. I think I got a job! Look after my belongings. Come in. Hello, sir. - Where? I'm here! Greetings! What? Hello. - Greetings. I'm Sunny. - Okay. I've studied journalism in London. - Very good! I'm a son of a rich man too. - Really? My dad can buy such presses if he wants. Then do buy them. - No. I want to stand on my own two feet, without my dad's support. What are you standing on right now? Anyways, no problem. Look, If you want to stand on your feet, make our press stand first, because our newspapers get printed, but they don't sell. Bring front page news, that our paper gets sold before it's even printed. Anna, I'll bring front page news! - Very good God! Thank you very much God! You're really great. Savitri! - I'm coming. What's the matter? Savitri, tomorrow the advocate's family is coming to see Deepa. Yes! - I bought a beautiful sari for her. Look, it's lovely! What's the use of a sari if our daughter is absent? Where is our daughter? - She must've gone there. Catch them! - Police! I'll provide you news, but what will I get in return? Here. Wow! I saw... - Speak in Hindi! Last night, one lady gave birth to 7 children. 7 children? The 8th kid is to be born! Call the doctor! God! It's hurting! No. 7! It's a fact! Madam, 7 at a time at one go? Fantastic! Congratulations, madam! Madam, 1 photograph please. Thank you. Smile! Okay! That's it! Very good! This is our daughter Deepa. Hello. - Hello! Deepa, have a seat. Sit. - Walk properly! Get them married as early as possible. I'll print the news of their marriage on the front page. Like this. Oh God! - Oh God! Why are you so shocked? I won't charge you for that. It's my press. Have a glance at the paper. No need to see the paper! Shut up! Whose daughter is this? Is she the neighbour's? She's definitely our daughter! Whose 7 kids are these? This girl is ours, but the 7 kids aren't hers. See that! Listen to me! - Move! Father! Father! Mother! Close the door! Deepa! Deepa! Deepa! Deepa, why are you crying? Why didn't you tell me that you're leaving school? We're going to London for my mom's treatment and will stay there. Even my parents wanted me to go to another school, but I refused, for you. And you're leaving me? I'll return once I complete studying. Write to me and I'll stay in touch too. Sunny! Yes, coming. Keep my photo with you and I'll keep yours with me. Let's go. I'm in this state today because of you. Why did you go away? I haven't been able to forget you. I haven't forgotten. Mr Iyengar! - News reporter! Come here! Come here! - I knew you'd go crazy and you've indeed gone crazy. I was printing, composing and developing all night. I kept on walking back and forth. I didn't have liquor, didn't shave and didn't even eat. You didn't eat. - No! Would you like to? - If you offer with love. I'll feed you with great love. Have a seat. Wow! Hot food! Did all your papers sell? There are a few left. - Oh no! Whose picture did you publish in our newspaper? That girl's. And her dad's photo? - I'll do it! I'm the father of that girl. Print my picture! Congratulations! You're a grandpa of 7 kids! Shut up! That girl is unmarried! How can she have kids? You've created a problem, you broke her engagement. Now eat this paper up! Eat this. How can I eat paper? I'll add salt and spices to it. I'll pour curry on it. Here! I'll wash my hands. - Sit! Eat. Eat it up! I've heard that each grain is destined to be in someone's name. It seems the one who has the paper, consumes it. Have it! - Eat! Eat! - Curry and paper! Never heard of it. Eat! It's very tasty! I can't gulp it. - You surely can! Ate it? He ate it! Now eat this. - Gulped it? It'll go down fast! Eat! Again! Kick him and throw him out! I might as well eat well. Get out! - Don't hit me! Iqbal! - Yes, uncle! Look at the beautiful Eid moon. Happy Eid! I'll first greet mom on Eid. Mom, happy Eid. Our ancestors say One should see an auspicious face after seeing the Eid moon. For me, in this world, in this universe. you come after God. Only you. But you didn't fulfil even a single wish of mine. On every Eid, mothers get... new clothes stitched, prepare sweets and hug their children. But... But you never blessed me, for a longer life. That all my wishes are fulfilled. You never did. Well, may God keep you in good health, wherever you are. Enough! Stop it! Goga. - Yes. When did you last give her a shock? - 15 days back. I told you to give her shock treatment daily! I'm sorry. If she gains her memory back, I'll kill you! She should forget her past! Since you've brought her, she's in the same condition. She's like a moving dead body, whom you've kept alive. Why don't you kill her? - No! She is an emblem of my victory, whom I've brought home like a prey, just to decorate my house. And... This is her punishment. Sir, she's all right! - Out! Salma! You mustn't think a lot. The doctor said that it's bad for your health. Here's a letter from your son from India. Here. He wrote that he'll soon get a job as a reporter. And that he'll quit drinking forever.

If I hide you, the police will arrest me. You lost the job because of me. - Yes! Look at this! Rs. 5000! Take me home and you'll be rewarded Rs.5000. We'll split the money. I'll run away again. You take me home! Half will be yours and half, mine. Sir! Here is your reward. Good bye! See you again! - Thank you! Hey man! Give my share! You caught me, I won't spare you! I'll get you! - Shut her in the room! She's 5 feet 2 inches tall and belongs to an Iyengar family. Stand straight! 5 feet 2 inches. She has a wheatish complexion and her name is Deepa. Don't you know that Tamilians are great? - Hurry up. This time they're going to give a special reward to a Tamilian. It takes 5 minutes to become a Punjabi, Gujarati or Marathi. It takes time to become a Tamilian. I'll go there and say, 'Mr Iyengar, hello!' I risked my life to save your daughter! I can win Rs. 5000! 'I belong to the brave Kattaboman's royal family.' 'I fought exactly like him with the sword.' So you're the missing girl! Come on! - No! Sit! - Save me! Where are you? Save me! - Where are you taking the girl? Hey tall guy! What, shorty? Why are you taking her? - For a reward. I told her dad that I'm bringing his daughter. Tell him that a tall guy is taking her home. Okay. Tall guy! "Hey tall man." - "Speak shorty." "Hey tall man." - "Speak shorty." "Don't block my path." "Don't block my path." "Don't touch this girl." "Hey shorty." - "Speak tall man." "Hey shorty." - "Speak tall man." "Don't block my path."

Let's go. Stand in one place! Hello, sir. You? I'm the owner. What are you doing here? The map lying in front of you shows where our houses stand. Give us the charge of those houses. Have you paid the advance? - Yes! Here is the receipt. Where is the balance? Here. You promised us to give houses at Rs.5000. Houses for Rs. 5000! Nonsense! Vicky? - Yes, dad? Where are the contract papers? - Here. Show them. Houses for Rs. 5000. Advance of Rs. 1000 and Rs.49,000 before buying the houses. 49,000? Rs. 1000 less than Rs. 50,000. Read this! No. This is a lie, it's injustice. We had agreed on Rs. 5000! You added a zero. What do you mean? You can't get doors and windows with Rs.5000. Get the money and then speak! Get out! Get him out! Throw him out! This isn't right! Be ready to face the consequences! We'll surely voice this out. - Out! He spoke of Rs. 50,000! Let's go to Iqbal! See how we've taken a hold of her property. Now the question of Julie's remaining property... I remember... Did you speak to her about marriage? Yes, daddy. - What did she say? She declined. Declined? Greetings, madam. - Greetings. We'll have to make her agree, so that we'll have half of the share in her property. How? Daddy, have water. What happened, uncle? Julie, good you're here. Dad had a heart attack. I'll call a doctor. Uncle! Uncle! My child, I wanted to talk to you. Good that you came. Your father had promised me something. Will you fulfil it? - Yes. Please marry him. That's impossible. I want to avenge my father's death. Avenging your dad's death is your wish. But your marriage... was your dad's wish. Uncle, why don't you understand? I can't get married! Why don't you get engaged? - Uncle! Let me die in peace. I raised you like my daughter since you were 5 years old. With the hope that you would fulfil my last wish. - Uncle! Okay. Bless you! I will die happy, seeing my daughter-in-law. Father, doctor is here. - Send him back. Now that you're getting engaged, I feel perfectly fine. Julie agreed to get engaged. Really, Julie? Print cards! Invite people for the engagement. Your engagement has been fixed for the 2nd of next month. Where is the department of printing wedding and engagement cards? Hey! Hello, sir! - Interrupting my drinking! Hey shorty! - Tall guy! Here for the reward? - No! Is the engagement card of Mr. Vicky's son being printed here? Yes! Do I print them for you too? Yes, but not a card! Listen... What's the date printed on the card? 2nd. - That's it. Take with this hand and return with that hand. What? Excuse me! Yes? Who are you? Didn't you recognize me? - No. Didn't you recognize the famous reporter of Rigby? My card? Move it! - Okay, sir. I want to print your picture on the front page and show the world! Bad shot! Good try! I'll write that you're a generous person. Till now, rich people invite only the rich for the parties, but you'll be the first person to invite the poor, that too porters. Porters? Nonsense! Porters at our party? The porters who insulted you. Don't you believe this? Have a look. What do you think of the fun these porters are having? Shut up! (Vocal gibberish) (Vocal gibberish) What are you up to? Who sent you inside? That's strange! First you invite us and then you forget. We've got an invitation card for the engagement. Look. - What misbehaviour is this? Drive them out! Michael! You want Michael? There's Michael and party. Excuse me. They're your guests. You invite them and then drive them out? This isn't good. Bad publicity. Vicky, call the other people and ask why they aren't here. One pose please. - Of course. Put your arm around him. - Why not? Smile please. Hello. - Hello, Uncle Zafar, I'm Vicky. Vicky, I have an invitation to your engagement. What happened? - What? Today is the 2nd, my engagement. Today? - Today's the 2nd. The date printed is the 20th. - How did it change? Like 5 changes to 50. You taught this to us and we used it on you. So, you did this? - Yes. Thank you. We did this, thanks to you. Till you don't give us houses, we'll stay in your house. We'll consider it our own. What do you say? - Yes! Excuse me, could you throw some light on this? Is this your way to get the houses? Sir, you took our money in your way, we'll get the houses, our way. You want houses, right? - Yes. You'll get them. Excuse me! They have a right to the houses and you've grown pale. Do you want to say something? They'll get the houses that they have a right on. - I see. You want a house, right? Here. Happy? What happened? Are they small? It's bigger than your heart. We'll provide... what's necessary for rich people like you in this house. Move away! What are you doing? I'm trying to decrease the size of this chandelier, or it won't fit in this house. Iqbal. - Yes! Could you throw some light on the chandeliers and the houses? I'm about to throw many things. Wait and watch. Do you know how costly that was? - Excuse me! What do you think about the chandelier in pieces? - Shut up! I will. Iqbal... - What? I use a plate as a mirror. You want a mirror? You'll get it. I would've photographed it, had I known. Binbal? - Yes, Iqbal. Can you see yourself? - Yes. It's great. Excuse me! It's unlucky for a mirror to break during an engagement. What do you think about it? A clock is necessary for us to reach on time. - Yes! Just a moment! Smile! Now break it. - There we go! Uncle! - Yes! Friends, take your share. Your misbehaviour... - This pendulum moves, it keeps moving. This time belongs to us now. - I... What's your opinion about this moving pendulum? Shut up! Vicky, call the police! Wait a minute! Now break it! Hello! I want a fan. I want it. Hold it! Thank you. Your turn. What's all this? Who are these people? So you've reached here too. We're guests. We received the invitation cards. Uncle Ramu, did you get everything or is there anything left? He only wants a wife now. A wife? A wife! - Let go! Uncle. Look at yourself and me. Does this girl suit you? I'm keeping her for me. He's holding my hand and you aren't doing anything. He's come with so many men. I would've dealt with him if he was alone. Consider me alone. I need to settle a few matters with you. Do I settle them now? - Sure. Leave him. Now this iron weapon will kill you. We're made up of iron walls and these are our weapons. They can feed us and can cut you too. Excuse me! Hello! Smile! - No! Your body is sinking because of the eagle's weight. Do you have anything to say? Oh I forgot. You can't speak. Cheers for Iqbal! What are you doing? - C'mon! Just a moment Iqbal, smile! - Leave me. Uncle, call the police. - What are you doing? Uncle... She'll be in our custody till we get our houses. Uncle... - Want a receipt? Uncle... - C'mon, friends! Uncle, call the police. They defeated you and embarrassed you. Any comments? - Shut up. You shut up! Leave me! I said leave me! - Don't move your legs. Shut up and sit here. Sit! Lie down! I'm warning you, let me go! I'll send you to jail. I'll handcuff you now. Next I'll send your partner to jail. Leave me! - Shut up! Or I'll break you like I broke your house at the party. Big talks. Will you have food? - No. Don't eat. I'm telling you to sing. Water is leaking! Look ma'am, you get water through taps, we get it from the roof. I can't cook here now. 'Welcome to Akashvani Radio' 'We present Swami Sevanand on a special programme.' 'We'll now teach you various methods of doing yoga.' Chef Khan was supposed to teach us a new recipe with eggs.

'Don't move.' 'Moving isn't good for the health.' - 1 2... 'Take another egg.' 'Break it and put it in the pan.' Break it... 'Now do a headstand.' 'A headstand. Slowly!' - Headstand. Okay. - Slowly, slowly... 'Look at the omelette cooking.' Madam, can you see it? How is it? Great! It's good, right? After so much hard work it has to be good! 'Keep your legs down.' 'Now slowly stand up. Slowly.' 'Be seated' - Again! 'and place your right leg' 'on your neck.' Right leg. - 'Slowly.' 'Don't do it in a hurry.' 'Place your right leg on your neck.' Oh God! Spices used in the omelette are wonderful. - What's happening? I'm stuck! I'm locked! Let me go! The keys! No! Madam, please unlock me too. Please! Oh, God! Sir, your neck is trapped with your legs. What is your opinion on this? - Very bad. Thank you. - Okay. Please help me! Help! Help! Help! Allahrakha... Don't try to run away! Or Allahrakha will gouge your eyes out! Come here and help me get rid of this situation. Come! My neck! My body is aching! 'Your French omelette is ready.' 'Eat it and...' - I'll show it! I'll hit it! Hey girl! Hold this! I'm going to the railway station. When I return, keep the French omelette ready. Understood?! Allahrakha! My brother. Keep a watch on her, Allahrakha. Don't be afraid, dear. Whenever the train passes, the houses of the poor shake. I'm returning from a pilgrimage to Shirdi. I heard that Iqbal brought you here forcefully. The donkey! No decision can be taken in a hurry. You can go. It... - Shut up. You have troubled me a lot. I won't spare you. You wanted a French omelette, right? Why are you killing a dead person? He wished to have a French omelette made by you. When he was walking towards the station, the train broke him into little pieces. Every piece was yelling out your name. Our beloved brother has left us. But there was no such news in today's paper. No one prints news of a poor person like him. If a person like your uncle had died, they would've printed it. If you don't believe me, check for yourself. Porters have erected a statue in his memory at Rani Baug. He died for you. So you can express your love... - What? Tell his statue what you feel for him. So that at least his statue will rest in peace. I can't stand to know of the death of such a great young man. I shiver with fear when I think of this. Will you come? Iqbal! 'What are you thinking about?' 'If you have feelings for him, go.' 'If you don't, don't go.' How long should I hold you like this? Hold me until the girl comes. Here she is! Jump! Jump! - Hold this. Umbrella! She's also carrying two candles. Candles? For whom? Only she knows. Come. The craftsman has created such a lovely statue. Feels like he will speak any time. He's unable to speak right now, as it's just a statue. I wish you had waited... for a few days. We could've got to know each other better. The moment I saw you on the railway station, my heart started beating. What happened? What happened? No need to be shy. I thought you would reach my home in my search. I didn't know the address. - What? He didn't have the address. How could he reach your place? You troubled me a lot. You carried me away like luggage in front of many people. I liked that attitude, your bravery. You should've said that before. You should've said it before. Why are you interrupting? - I am not! I cried a lot seeing your photo in the newspaper and I didn't know whether it was sympathy or love. They say that love can make... a dead person alive with its power, I wish my love had that power. See, here I turn alive! Are you... alive? Was it an act? - It wasn't an act. The power of your love did this. - Who said I love you? When I was a statue, you loved me. As I turned alive, you started hating me. I don't care about you! I don't have any feelings for you. You're a cheap person! She's gone. Hey, Sunny! Hey, Sunny... Where have you escaped? The train has lost its track! You? Don't keep staring. Clear the water. You? What are you doing? Can't you see? I'm clearing the water. How will I cook the special omelette? What are you doing here at this hour? I'm here of my own will. I've also decided that, I won't move... until the porters get their houses. Such heavy rainfall... Water-logging... Are you here... to give us the houses? No, I'm here... to create my own home. Oh Lord. "Allahrakha!" "Allahrakha!" "Two souls are heartily celebrating." "Two souls are heartily celebrating." "It's neither your mistake, nor mine." "Neither did you see a signal, nor did I." "It led to an accident, oh God!" "It led to an accident, oh God!" "Two souls are heartily celebrating." "It's neither your mistake, nor mine." "Neither did you see a signal, nor did I." "It led to an accident, oh God!" "It led to an accident..." "We made an agreement and it was permanent, oh God!" "Two crazy people, we didn't look back or forward." "We placed the train of our heart on the track." "Two crazy people, we didn't look back or forward." "We placed the train of our heart on the track." "Neither did you see the signal, nor did I see the flag." "It led to an accident, oh God!" "It led to an accident..." "We made an agreement and it was permanent, oh God!" "Allahrakha!" "The paths were misty, youth blossomed." "You were unveiled." "You were unveiled." "The ambience was playful." "The ambience was playful." "Neither did you notice the danger." - "Nor did I." "It led to an accident, oh God!" "It led to an accident." - "We made an agreement." "It was permanent, oh God!" "We'll have to make up for the loss." "We have to fall in love." "We'll have to make up for the loss." "We have to fall in love." "Neither did you whistle, nor did I." "It led to an accident, oh God!" "It led to an accident, oh God!" "Two souls are heartily celebrating." "It's neither your mistake, nor mine." "Neither did you see a signal." - "Nor did I." "It led to an accident, oh God!" "It led to an accident, oh God!" "It led to an accident." - "We made an agreement." "It's permanent, oh God!" "Allahrakha!" "Allahrakha!" "Allahrakha!" Do I offer them houses at Rs. 5000? They should get them at Rs. 5000 or I won't marry. Why do you care? Because the way they live, they should get houses for free. But the houses... - Just a minute. If we agree... to offer them houses at Rs. 5000, will you agree to get married? Yes, but keep in mind, I'll get married only when the porters get their houses. Listen, all my brothers! Keep your money ready! We'll be getting our houses soon! Yes! Let's go to the chit fund to withdraw the money. Welcome, Goga. The police has raided our Madras Fund. - What? Zafar told us to vacate this place before the police reaches here! Hurry up Bob, we should leave as soon as possible and burn all the documents! So the police won't get any evidence when they arrive... You're a spy? Take him inside! Quiet! Sunny? - Be ready to go to jail. You, dad and his followers! Take him upstairs! - Tie him! We'll decide about him when Zafar comes. You won't decide! I'll show you! I was on this case for a while! Now I have proof! All your bad deeds will soon be exposed. Thief! You think it's your money?! C'mon, boys! The goods seem to be heavy. Do you need a porter? Will you stop us? - Yes. Because the money is ours. C'mon! You have no place to run. We've surrounded the place! One hand of Maruti is enough for you. I made a mistake by cutting only one hand. I will cut the second one too. Give me the axe! How dare you shed the blood of porters in my absence? You burnt all the documents and tried to run away with the fund? Iqbal! Did you see that, Iqbal? My dad's acquaintances tried to kill me but my mom saved me. That's why I always carry my mom's photo with me. That's what a mother is. Whenever I'm sad, I pour out my heart sitting in front of my mom's photo. When I am happy, I go to my mom's photo to express my joy. You're fortunate to have a mother and her picture. I am so unfortunate that I only have my mom's picture. I don't have a mother. - Why? We were separated. How? A long time ago, when I was eight years old, there was a flood... that destroyed the entire village. Mom and dad... All... They all drowned. After a span of time, I saw my mom in the train. I was telling her... that I'm her son. But she was looking at me with clueless eyes. It was like... she didn't recognize me! I'll write about her in the paper. We'll find her! What's her name? Salma. Salma? My mother's name is Salma. Where is she? I've heard that she was abroad. Abroad? Mom! Mom! I am Iqbal, your son. I'm here to take you along. Try to remember mom, we were so happy! A flood took all the happiness away. Once... Just once address me as your son and embrace me. Or else I'll die at your feet. Right from childhood, not one day has passed when I didn't miss you... and didn't cry. Today... After years, fate is on my side. Now, with a mother, my life's goal is achieved. Let's go, mom. Come with me. I've come to take you with me. Hey mister, you're under arrest. For what offence? Trying to kidnap this lady. She's my mom. - He's lying. She isn't his mom nor is he, her son. You can ask the lady! Is he your son? She can't speak. She's lost her memory. What's the proof that she's your mother? If you look into my heart, you'll find my mother's image. The law doesn't accept this! Then even I don't believe in your law. She's my mother! I'm taking my mom... and no one can stop me. Leave my hand! Mom! Mom! Lie down. Hit him! Don't talk nonsense. He isn't Salma's son. He wanted to run away with our wealth. You stole his biggest wealth, his mom. Stealing at a thief's place can't be called stealing. Sunny! - Don't shout! I know what you do and what your business is! How you cheated the poor of their money through the chit fund. This film contains all that stuff. If you don't get my brother released and if you don't return all the money to the poor porters, I'll publish all your deeds in tomorrow's newspaper. Get it? What if I agree to what you say? Then I won't publish it. Fine. I'll be back with a cheque. Mom, I'll take you to my brother, Iqbal. Here. This is your cheque. Hello. - Zafar here. Yes, sir. - Sunny knows too much about us, so kill him. Slow! Stop the car! Salma. Salma, we have so many business rivals. They couldn't stand our progress and wanted to kill our son. I'll take you to the shrine today. You can read the holy book and thank God for saving our son's life. I'll get the signatures on a few papers. He'll get released from jail after 14 years. And you are taking her to the shrine? Where is the shrine? In front of the jail. Then, after he leaves jail... She's here to thank God for saving her son's life. May God give your son a long life. May He keep you and your husband in good health. May He protect him from all the perils. Where will you go now? Brother, I'll go to the shrine and ask him, where my lost ones are. Goodbye, Aslam. - Goodbye. Oh God! Do you recognize this sepulchre? It's my master's. And you are responsible for his death. Me? No! But who are you? I'm Julie. The daughter of the same master. Dear Julie! I was waiting for this opportunity for 14 long years. To kill you the day you stepped out of jail. My child, I swear that I didn't murder your father. That'll be decided right away. I'll pray to God before dying. You had 5 chances to prove yourself innocent. I think you're innocent. I said the same thing insistently in the courtroom, that I am innocent. But this wealthy world didn't allow me to speak. Who is the murderer of my dad? When I was drowning, there was one gentleman who saved me. That gentleman was your dad. 'I had parted from my wife and son.' 'If it wasn't for his support...' 'He gave me a job in his mill.' 'Once the workers got a bonus of 6 months,' 'but his partner gave us a bonus of 1 month.' 'He got the documents signed by us.' 'When my master found out, he called his partner' 'and talked to him.' 'He denied the accusations.' 'Then he said, that whatever has to be done, will be done.' 'When my master tried to call the police, he shot him!' 'Before I could do something, he threw the gun at me.' When I rushed to inform the police,' 'I bumped into his partner Mr. Puri.' 'I was pleading that I was innocent.' 'Suddenly you came down on hearing the sound of the pistol.' and you found your father dead. 'That mean partner picked up a gun lying on the ground as evidence' 'and started saying that I had killed your dad.' 'Even you considered me to be a murderer.' What's the name of the partner? His name is Zafar. Zafar. What do you think of this? Zafar, friendship and business are two different matters. We'll have to incur a loss of 5-6 million for your victory. What's the use? I tried doing many businesses and I lost. This was the only business left, so I tried it. If I win, I'll issue all the tenders in your name. What say? But uncle, who will vote for you? He's right, Zafar. You remember what I said? Give houses to porters and they'll be of help during the election. Here are the papers of the new houses. Listen! What's his name... Iqbal. - Iqbal. Tell him that I've kept my promise. Congratulations. Julie, are you happy now? Let's go. I'm doing this for you. I've kept my promise. You have to fulfil my promise. Promise? Which one? That of getting married. Marriage! Sure. How nice! But I won't marry you, I'll marry Iqbal. What? Did Julie say that? Yes, dad! - Vicky. Follow my method and you'll always benefit. Either get the one whom you want, or kill her. No! I'll surely kill, not Julie, but that porter Iqbal. 'Iqbal!' Hey ya.... "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "Our eyes met in the market" "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "Our eyes met at such an early age." "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "Whenever young souls meet, it leads to a beautiful story." "When clouds touch the mountains, rain falls." "The sound of the raindrops..." - "The raindrops..." "The raindrops..." - "The sound of the raindrops..." "Lightning fell in the monsoon..." "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "God, hurry up and make me a groom." "God, hurry up and make me a groom." "We can't trust you guys." "Bring a pen, paper and agreement." "We can't trust you guys." "Bring a pen, paper and agreement." "I'll bequeath my life to you if you want." "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." "We have fallen in love." "Ask how we are doing." Mom! Mother! - Mom! Mother! Doctor. - We operated on her and removed the bullet, but the poison has spread throughout her body. Her condition is very critical. I can't predict anything. How's mom? - It's difficult to predict anything. Sunny! Iqbal, save my mother! Please save my mother. I'm taking an oath. Once my mother is saved, I'll never have liquor again. I'll never drink! Don't be afraid, Sunny. God is great... and listens to everybody. What's the matter, Allahrakha? "O my Lord, here I am at Your service." "O my Lord, here I am at Your service." "O my Lord, here I am at Your service." I got it. I got it, Allahrakha. You're telling me to go for the pilgrimage. Maybe God created you for this. Now obeying your orders, I'll go for the pilgrimage. On behalf of the committee, we welcome those who are proceeding for the pilgrimage. We request you all to keep your passports, tickets and doctor's certificate ready, to get them checked at the entrance. Thank you. You have fever. Proceed for a medical check-up. You have high fever. Don't worry, let me go. We'll have to do a blood test. You might be suffering from malaria, typhoid etc. You can't travel until we're done with the medical test. Even major diseases fade away during the pilgrimage. You're right, sir, but I'm helpless. We need to take care of formalities in two countries. I'm sorry. Where is the priest? - There. Hello. - Greetings. What's the matter? Please tell them to let me go. My mother is critically ill. I'm going on this pilgrimage with great hope. I'm ready to knock the doors of God. I'll pray a lot for my mom. Please tell them to allow me, it's the last boat. My child, it's God's wish. No one can go there... until He calls. Look at that... old man who has been lying there for 15 days. He says that he wants to go, or he'll kill himself. All his documents are ready. But he doesn't have money for a ticket. You've got a ticket, but you can't go. Why don't you make an exchange? Exchange? Send him on your behalf. Your pleas will reach there through him, and your mom will get a new life. Bless you. Uncle... Uncle. - Who's that? Oh God. What's wrong? Do you want to go on the pilgrimage? Yes. He keeps testing all of us. Now even I need to test him. Let's see if He wants to shower his favours on the poor and whether He wants to call us. He has called you, uncle. You'll surely go. Me? Yes, uncle. I want to send you in my place. But you'll have to ask God for a favour on my behalf. Tell him to save my mom's life. Pray to Him to save my mother! Many years back, my son promised to take me on the pilgrimage. Today, I feel... as if he's fulfilling that promise. Yes. Praise... - The Lord! Happy pilgrimage. May God keep you and your mother happy. "My eyes keep searching," "for God every day." "With Your grace, I'm searching for God." "Happy Hajj pilgrimage to you all." "Happy Hajj pilgrimage to you all." "I wasn't fortunate enough to see Madina." "Convey my prayers to him."

"Oh king of heavens and king of Madina..." "Oh king of heavens and king of Madina..." "Oh king of heavens and king of Madina..." Mother! Nurse! Iqbal, mom has regained consciousness. Your mom is fine now. Don't talk too much, let her rest. Just a moment. Drinking has ruined both his kidneys. One kidney is enough to survive. But he needs a kidney of a living person and I suppose as a father, you'll donate one kidney to him. Doctor, never ever talk about this, in front of him or my wife. Even if he had been my own son, I wouldn't have donated my kidney. Isn't he your son? - No. My wife was ill at that time, a doctor like you advised me that, if she had to recover, let her embrace any child as her own, so I brought an orphan from an orphanage. Neither is he my child, nor am I his father. C'mon. Sunny? Where did he go? Take everything, my hat, coat and shoes. This bottle has gone empty. Sunny, what are you doing? I went to the hospital and I found that you escaped. You're sick, let's go. Who are you to take me away? - Your elder brother! Did you listen? He's my elder brother. I don't know who my parents are and he says he's my elder brother. What's bothering you? Tell me, I'll drink your sorrows away. But don't ever say I'm not your brother. Our fortune has been written by some inauspicious pen. Don't say that. - Let go! You have a mom, still you didn't get her. I lost her although I have her. Mother! Sunny! - Let go! Even the bond of brotherhood that we had, has been broken. Go away, my brother. Sunny! I promise that I'll break all my relations, but I'll never break our brotherhood. - Let go! An orphan has no relations. I'm an orphan brought from an orphanage in Kanpur! Sunny! Go away! - No, I won't leave! Leave at once! Sunny! Sunny! Uncle, call a taxi. - Taxi! I was right. He was drinking inside. We need to take him to the hospital. Careful! Why does he drink so much? He found out that Mr. Zafar brought him from an orphanage in Kanpur, he started drinking. My son! Iqbal, he's my son! I recognize the mark on his foot. He's my lost child. Your child? - Yes! We need to rush to the hospital. I'll donate my kidney! What's this in your hand? You can't take that with you to the operation theatre. What's the matter? Sunny. - Iqbal. This is the girl I love. I lost her in childhood. If something happens to me... You keep saying foolish things! You'll be back shortly. Go. Sunny! Where is Sunny? In the operation theatre. Why are you crying? What's wrong? - He's crazy. He said that I should burn this photo if something happens to him. Nothing will go wrong. This... This is my photograph! Your photo? - Yes. Sunny and I used to study in the same school. Look! And... And we parted... Doctor Congratulations! The operation is successful. Sunny! Sunny! There's going to be a programme held for the minister. Shall we also get married on the same day? Nice idea. But I need to get revenge on someone. You have an entire life to do that. But... we just have a short span of time, or else we'll never be able to get married. And we'll lose our chance. What are you thinking? "We shouldn't be losing out on love." "We shouldn't be losing out on love." "The heart shouldn't break in the game of love." "No thief should steal..." "No thief should steal" "our tickets." "We shouldn't be losing out on love." "We shouldn't be losing out on love." "The heart shouldn't break in the game of love." "No thief should steal..."

"The heart shouldn't break in the game of love." Parvati, bless him. I got a strong support for my old age now. Parvati, if you were here... - I'm here, father! You offered me a new life by donating a part of your body. From now on, I'll shoulder all your responsibilities. No, you're a journalist! We need you... to voice the problems of the poor. Iqbal, ready! Why are you taking photos? We'll be able to print posters. Posters? - Yes. You're contesting the elections. - I... Elections? - Yes, Iqbal, you'll contest the elections! Have you gone nuts? Leadership requires education. I'm not educated! Who told you that all politicians are educated? Sit on the chair once, then you'll realize. Sit! - Sit down! The rich will never know how the poor suffer. Only a hungry person can understand hunger. Homeless people know the value of a house. Only a porter will understand porters' problems. Yes, that's right. I don't know how to give a speech. - Right! He keeps chatting and says he can't give one. But it requires money. Where will we get that? We don't need to buy votes. Porters will support you nationwide. What say? Yes! What say, Allahrakha? You'll be the emblem of our party. And we'll have to defeat Zafar who gets votes by bribing people. Thank you. 'Drive away poverty and vote for a bolt of fire.' 'If you want a raise,' 'vote for the greatest.' 'This man will bring light into your lives!' 'We promise to resolve all your problems.' 'We'll install taps and lights in your colonies.' 'The party leader is Zafar Khan,' 'the well-known owner of D'costa Mills.' 'Vote for Zafar Khan!' 'Vote for the greatest! He is great!' Zafar! You... Aslam! You? Come! I am... - Aslam! I've been looking for you since you were released... To apologize for my ill deeds. I've got good news. - What? Your wife and son are alive. Alive? - Yes. Where are they? - Let's meet them. Oh God! Iqbal! Zafar! I won't let you reach the election platform. Stop! Three cheers for Iqbal! Three cheers for Iqbal! Three cheers for Iqbal! Three cheers for Iqbal! Three cheers for you! Because you, in order to show the rich people, took me to an election platform from a railway platform! Yes. You can ask any question that you wish to ask. Can an uneducated poor person fulfil the needs of poor people? Can you solve their grievances? Can you provide them food and shelter? No one can do that, because it's God who does that. He has given us two hands to earn our own livelihoods. You rich people... take away our share of food too! You suck our blood! If you could, you'd sell our souls too. Do you think you're the ones who shoulder all the responsibilities? You need the rich to fulfil the needs of so many people! You'll have to agree, nothing can happen without rich people. How's that possible? Have you ever heard of rich people sacrificing their lives at war? It's the poor man who sacrifices his life and makes his nation proud. The world keeps moving because of us. Right from the Taj Mahal to the smallest hut... Every building has been created by people like us. The rich have created everything by resorting to corruption. These people buy votes for Rs 10... Get approvals for Rs. 100... Pay thousands to pass an exam... Shell out millions to get tenders passed. Only if the corrupt fail will the nation progress. Stop him or I'll get a heart attack! Where is Zafar? - Dad! Do I have to answer that? - No! I'll answer this question. Move! Brothers... This blood and injuries, were caused by this porter! He didn't want me to come here, so he shot me by sending his girlfriend. Lies! Then check who's arrested at the police station! But... I'll shower flowers on the one who tried to do this. Don't look there. Listen to me first and then look over there. Your father, Mr. Aslam is alive and he's in my custody. My father? - Yes. The person who's coming to that platform. Your father's life is in danger right now. So you better quit the elections, or... What's the matter, son? Uncle. Is the person standing there, my dad? Aslam! Yes, he is your dad! Welcome, Mr. Zafar. Zafar has done great work while offering a garland to me, that I can't say anything, nor defeat him. My... The answer to my prayers is with him. I withdraw my name from the election and... apologize to all. He hasn't decided to step down because of good work by Zafar. Zafar must have blackmailed him! This woman will voice out all his bad deeds. My husband, Iqbal's father, greetings to you! Greetings to you, dear! My brothers... - How did she speak? Mom, don't say anything against Zafar. Father's life is in danger. The Almighty who united both of us, will save his life. Mr. Zafar, you must be very surprised to hear my voice. It's God's miracle that he returned my memory and speech. Cut the wire of their microphone. My brothers, this person who's trying to collect your sympathies, is in fact a rascal and cheat! He has destroyed many... You can't stop me by cutting an electric wire. I'll make sure that my voice reaches each and every soul. He killed my father! He kept giving me electric shocks for 20 long years, so that I don't recall my husband and son. This is injustice! My brothers, I used to give her electric shocks, at the advice of a doctor and not at my own will, as she was mentally ill. You can ask him if you want! My dear brothers, what shall I say? Mr. Zafar has spent his life looking for her husband. When he found him alive, he brought him here, so that he could unite them in front of everyone! If you curse him, it'll be as good as cursing humanity . Mr. Aslam, proceed. Your wife is waiting for you. What are you doing? I'm doing the right thing. We could lose a lot if we don't do this. If the public gets violent, we'll be done for. I don't care about the public, money and an election. I've never learnt to accept defeat. If I don't get Salma, she can never be with anyone else! Let's go! I think something will go wrong here! Uncle! - Father! Uncle! - Father! I'll go on. I've received the signal. Iqbal... He... - Father! We have to break the stage! Move back! Sunny! Don't block my way, or I'll kill everybody! Leave me! Let me go! Come on. - Leave me! Zafar! It's a holy shrine and you can't enter it. No one can stop Zafar! - No! Let go of me! Leave my hand! God. - C'mon! Oh Lord. Please do a miracle. How long will you survive? There are three bullets left! Shoot me! If you have the weapons to kill I have God with me! Let's see if this sheet saves me or becomes my shroud. Shoot me! "God is one." (Islamic Chant) (Islamic Chant) "Allah is great." Iqbal! My son! My, son! Enough, mother! Mom, I'm alive just to listen to this word. Please call me your son once more. I'm embracing you after so long. Don't leave me. Don't leave me, my son. It's God... who gives life or death. Oh God. Congratulations! He is safe now. Thank God! God! - Thank you! Iqbal is here! Three cheers for Iqbal! - Praise Iqbal! Three cheers to you! I had died. I'm back only because of your prayers. "Hey porter!" "We lift the weight of the entire world!" "We lift the weight of the entire world!" "We lift it." "We lift the weight of the entire world!"
