Let's start dredging from here. Good morning lnspector. Good morning Marh. - How are you? - So-so, it's not bad. Thank you. 'Morning. 'morning. Good morning. How did it happen? Still not clear, but from the first summary investigations it is an accident. - How are you doing? - Fine. Hello. The decapitated, Umberto Paradisi, had rented the excavator for one day only with the driver, a certain Anzuini Mario who disappeared without a trace. The first hypothesis could be that Anzuini made a mistake in the maneuver and took Paradisi's head off and then panicked and went on the run. So do you think the case is solved? Of course, it's the usual involuntary manslaughter with escape of the person responsible. It will be enough for me to track down Anzuini and everything is solved. No, l'll take care of that. All right, lnspector, as you wish. Me and Bozzi will stick to forensics to get the result. We will give you a detailed report. I have here the documents found on Paradisi, - Shall l attach them to the report? - Yes. "Bruche and Capacci Company. Movers of large Earth material" "Decapitation in a Ouarry. Traces of blood on a digger- serious indications that the operator is sought by the police." - So, do you recognize him? - Yes, that's him. Didn't you ask him about the job he needed the excavator for? No, there's no reason why l should have. He paid in advance for the excavator and the driver and in cases like those we do not ask so many questions. - Will you sign my bill? - Yes. Start the truck now. Look what a fucking mess. - Does Anzuini like to drink? - Certainly not a teetotaler. Working here in the quarry the workers always have a throat full of dust. Let's make one thing clear: for us it was an accident and moreover we are insured. Can't you tell me where he is hiding? No, l have no idea. Are you sure? - Of course, otherwise l would tell you. - Are you sure? - Of course, otherwise l would tell you. All right. Anyway if he shows up tell him to turn himself in - for his own good. - Sure. But he's going to get into a lot of trouble, you know, he has a wife and four children, poor devil. It's too early to tell that. The investigation has just begun. Certainly the behavior of Anzuini is not clear. Why? I do not know, here in 15 years he has never had an accident. With machines he has always been the most skilled. Mrs. Paradisi, l'm sorry, fortify yourself. Please listen, here is Dr. Anna Borgese's answering machine. For professional reasons l'm momentarily unavailable. For any communication you have 45 seconds to leave a message and your name. Please speak at the signal. Anna, it's me, Luca. Please have a seat. I'll call you back later. Maybe l'll be free tonight. Bye. Madam, you must sign the identification report. Wait. Are you sure? - It is surely Umberto. - Was that your husband's name? Yes, but we were not married. - What did he do? - He was a sales representative. - For which company? - l do not know. He should have a sample book at home, a commission record book, maybe he had a collaborator. No, he used to work alone and didn't keep anything at home. He was often out for several days, then came back with the money, but where it came from... So you can't explain to me why he was on that field with that excavator. Correct? No, l don't know anything. Who knows. He had become so strange in recent times. What did you notice different in his behavior? He spoke little, he was out all day long. - Did your husband tell you about... - He was not my husband. Sorry. Did Paradisi ever have the occasion to mention in your presence such an Anzuini Mario? Do you remember? No, never. Negative result. The archive has no previous records, then Anzuini is not a previous offender. Previous offender or not, you have to find him. Yes? Tell me. How? We don't have to look for him, they have found him. - Inspector. Brigadier, good morning. - Hello. - Good morning. - Ah, good morning, lnspector. Good morning. The report arrived while l was in the operations room. Of course l ran here. They warned you, didn't they? - Yes, yes. - Inspector. Anyway here, as usual, we have not touched anything, but the case is quite clear, it is suicide. What is it? Doctor, look, l should talk to you for a moment. Please, do it. It changes from case to case. - Who found him? - The guardian. Have you touched anything? I have not touched anything, l called the police immediately. All right, you can go, l'll have them call you at the office. - Did you get the personal information? - Yes, Sir. Marh, it's murder, with suicide simulation. It is so, believe me. If Anzuini had really climbed on the bin to hang himself he would have stuck his head in the noose lifting on the tips, is that clear? Sure, we were saying that with you. In that case, after hanging himself, his height, due to the breaking of the cervical vertebrae, would be increased of two to three centimeters, don't you think, doctor? Yes, more or less two or three centimeters. And the feet could not have touched the bin, but they would have rested on it. So someone slipped the noose around the neck of Anzuini and then lifted him with the rope passed over the iron hanging him. Finally, to simulate suicide he put the bin and the empty flask under the body. It is a murder! Yes, sir, cruel and ruthless like the other commited with the excavator. I recommend it, evening edition eh! And add, the style of a sadistic killer to which the police of course will give no respite. Is that okay? I will keep you informed. Talk to you soon. Marh. Inspector l am doing here some public relations. - This is a journalist friend of mine. - Yes yes. Marh, we must sound out the swamp. Yes, okay, tomorrow afternoon? No today, and as soon as possible. I need to know what Paradisi was looking for, and why he was killed. All right. - But what are we looking for? - Maybe a corpse. - Another one? - Yes. Another one. But who lives up there? Did you get any information or is it still to be determined? No, no, a vagabond lives there, a certain Mattia Ouartapelle. Where are you going now, lnspector? I'll be right back. You meanwhile continue, search the bottom well. All right, lnspector. - May l come in? - lt is open. Who is it? Good morning. He also said good morning to me. - Are you Mr. Mattia Ouartapelle? - Ah he is a policeman. - They will never leave me alone. - Yes, that's him. - Can l ask you some questions? - But what do you have to ask me? - Excuse me, but are you a policeman? - Don't you see it? - May l? Adele Lodigiani, widow. - l am lnspector Peretti, nice to meet you. Mr. Ouartapelle. I have already told the police everything. Yes, l know. I read the report of your interrogation You did not see anything of what happened at the swamp because you go out every morning to go to work. Exactly. And, excuse me, what kind of work is it? What l find is mine. I do not understand, what does that mean? It means: if you throw away something, why are you throwing it away? Because you don't need it, it is indisputable, isn't it? - And who takes it away then? - The sweepers. Attaboy! But l arrive before them, l choose what l like and l bring it here, you see? - Is that clear? - Very clear. When Paradisi was killed you were not at home. What is said is said, what is written is written. Lord, l know nothing, l swear on the soul of my late lamented father who died. He's always like this, do not care about it. He is a good man, but he's a little grouchy. If you knew what l have to withstand, it needs my strength to live close to him, you know? But what can l do? After so many years l've become attached to him and l don't feel like leaving him alone. - But what would you do without me? - Fuck you. You may not believe this, but it's five years we are engaged. That's not true, don't listen to her. Never. Shame on you. He says no, but he is in love with me and gives me always the best stuff for women. What's that got to do with it? l find it inside the garbage and give it to her But l have furnished my home. l have a nice cottage, you know? My poor husband left it to me, holy soul. - Poor cuckold. - l have a TV set, a garden, a telephone. Why doesn't he come there? No, he wants to stay here, where now there is a swamp that stinks, that makes you stink. But why? Wasn't it there before? Of course there was not. Three months ago the sewer broke down and the municipality has not yet repaired it and you're okay with it anyway, this pig. I am clean. Not at all clean, considering that you fall out of bed every morning because the lices throw you down. - Who is it? - lnspector, we would have finished. All right, l'll be right there. Now l have to go. - Thank you ma'am and goodbye. - Goodbye. One moment, please. Have you come for the Moroni case? What? - Moroni. - No. Don't work so hard. Make love while you are young, because afterwards... l'll cut it, it's better. Hello. Here is Dr. Anna Borgese's answering machine. Due to professional reasons l'm momentarily unavailable. You have 45 seconds to leave a message and your name. Speak, please. So no one will bother us. So every time l call the answering machine? - Is it too strong? - No, that's perfect. - So you think that? - Yes, l will have you checked. I'm going to put a guard in permanent service here below the house. We are so little together that in the end we no longer know even what to tell each other. Do you know how l will end up? Like that girl who used to help me with the house. She was a day waitress and her husband a night watchman. To have a baby she had to resign. Luca, l speak seriously, l don't know, we should try to be a little more together. Do you want to ruin my evening again? It's not my fault if every time l have a free moment, l call you and it's the answering machine that answers me. Here Dr. Borgese's home. The doctor is not here due to professional reasons. One day you will phone me and the answering machine will not answer you anymore, a man will answer you. If it should happen don't say it was my fault. - You know what l was thinking of? - What? That you are right. Look, then will we go and see that house in Giglio? Yes, but not tomorrow. In the swamp we have found nothing and this weekend it will be hard. I have not succeeded yet in finding any clue. I have no elements, l hope to find some traces at Paradisi's home. You have to be patient, my love. These are the last ones. Do you know which lock they open? The jacket is one of those he used less. Maybe they come from the insurance office where Umberto worked until a year ago. No, no, no, this key is not from our offices. And what can you tell me about Paradisi? As far as Paradisi is concerned, yes he worked with us. He was one of our best detectives. He was highly respected. Ah, was he an investigator? - And why was he fired? - No, no, he was the one who left, right after the Moroni case, it seems to me. Now let's see. Grazia, please the Moroni file, yes. The Moroni case? Have you came for the Moroni case? Yes, yes the case of that little girl who was kidnapped. Have you heard about it? Yes, yes l remember now. A sensational case, perhaps you have not dealt with it, but it was in all the newspapers, l do not tell you then from the point of view of the insurance, a very complicated case precisely for this reason we gave it to Paradisi. Thank you. And where was the little girl kidnapped? In the park of the villa. She was playing quietly and when her mother looked outside of the window, the little girl was gone. Stefy, Stefania. She had been kidnapped. Her father did not notify the police, but immediately paid the ransom and in an attempt to get news of the little one, he followed the mediator, but he was discovered and kidnapped in turn. Here is how we found him one month later. We covered with an insurance the life of Moroni and her daughter was the beneficiary. So, we had to ascertain the identity of the two corpses and this was precisely the assignment given to Paradisi, and here his final report. "Witnesses Ouestioned: Rita, Oliviero Giorgio, Paola " Brigadier Bozzi. I would like to speak to lnspector Peretti. The inspector is out of the room. Who is speaking? I am Mrs. Paradisi, they phoned me from the post office. They say the deadline of a box assigned to Umberto has expired. Maybe those little keys found by the inspector? Well, one box can be a great place to hide something confidential. Have a look at it and if you find something bring it to our office. I will certainly do so. Have a nice day. - Have a nice day. Silvestri, also of this two photocopies. - Okay. - There is something new. But the post office can not phone to warn that the deadline has expired, because the mailbox is secret. Well, that's enough. Bozzi, a car quickly. No, look at that, it is useless, here we are stuck. I am going on foot, join me as soon as possible. How did it happen? I was at the counter, l had just picked up this express mail when l heard shouting. I turned around and saw that this poor girl was falling. On the spot l thought that she was sick, but then l realized she was dead. Did you see who did it? Yes, maybe a tall man with a dark coat. And have you seen him? Sure, but he was not tall. He was a stocky young man with dark glasses, a raincoat and a hat. - No, look, you are wrong. - No, no, l'm not wrong. No, what hat, what stocky, he was a young man, but bald. - I saw him very well. - l understand, thank you. Focus it well. It's drawing of a child on a very common squared notebook paper. What's there in the left corner? Magnify it. Looks like the imprint of a badly inked stamp, "uto", "ttine". "Benedictine institute" Here are the notebooks. In my opinion, there is no doubt, the drawing is Stefania's own. Here is the little flower. lt is on each drawing, like a signature. Have you shown these notebooks to someone? No. But Paradisi, the insurance detective, questioned you too. lsn't it true? Yes, a gentleman from the insurance company came here and asked me questions - rather generic, l would say. - Which ones? He asked me for information about the little girl's health condition, if she had any particular signs, abrasions or even small scars. In short, all that that could be useful for a sure identification of little Stefy. You see, they found her in an advanced state of decomposition. - Didn't you show him the notebooks? - No. I had them here on the desk, because someone from the Moroni family had insisted to have them as a memory. Instead, no one ever came to collect them and so they were left up here. I haven't put them in their place anymore. But can it be that, without your knowledge, that man consulted them? While he was there, they called me from the Management. I stayed 15 or maybe 20 minutes. When l returned, he had disappeared. l cannot exclude it. - Did you notice anything strange? - No, nothing. Shall we take a look at the notebooks? Of course. Here, look. Yes, it was made just one week before the kidnapping. I had assigned a drawing theme and the title was: "A house where l would like to live". This was the theme. Now if... Marh? - At your orders. - But if you stopped sleeping. Why did Paradisi tear this sheet and take it away? What's so important in this drawing? Good night, Miss and have a nice Sunday. Thank you. Good night. Come inside. - Inspector, the hot sandwiches. - Yes, put them there. Look at that, in your opinion, what is it? It is the drawing of a little boy. Mine makes many of them. Yes, but what does it represent? A colorful house between two small trees, on top of a hill, on one morning... ln spring. We found a poet here. Yes, all right, you can go, thank you. A colorful house between two small trees on top of a hill. With a funny object on the roof. But, it's Mattia's shack. It is located right in front of the place where Stefania and her father were separated. And the little girl drew it the week before being kidnapped. It means that the little girl already knew the place and perhaps Paradisi had discovered who had brought her there. And that's why she was killed and his wife also was killed. Kidnappers want to destroy any evidence, every link in the chain because by now they know that l walk the same Paradisi's path and... wait a minute, but the killer tore a piece of this drawing. Marh, the teacher! Call her now and warn her. - I'm going to the operations room. - Right away, right away. - But, what's this teacher's number? - Ah, it should be in the file. Is that 500 complete with tires? Listen, how many cars we have in the Rinascimento district? We have 21 and 13. Well, call one of them and tell it to drive to Via del Caravaggio 75. Fine. Squad car 21 call Double Sail 21 calls Squad car 21. Squad car 21, drive to via del Caravaggio 75 and wait for instructions. Inspector, the girl is not at home, no one answers the phone. Then phone the school, ask what time she left and if someone picked her up. - And then try again at home. - Okay. Miss, don't you recognize me? l am the accountant Civitelli, are you maybe afraid of me! If l have to tell the truth, a little bit yes. I understand you, strange guys are always around outside, that honest people now... - No one answers. - Try again. I apologize, l have to go. Do not worry, hurry, the phone rings. Thank you. Good night. Hello? Hello, who is it? But, who is speaking? Hello? Aah! Who is it? Who? What did you say? Ah! But, is it you? Hello, come in. You must excuse me if you find me in a mess, but l wasn't expecting anyone by now. I was about to go to bed. But. Where have you gone? The living room is this way. Please have a seat. Squad car 21 call Double sail 21. We are at number 75 of Via del Caravaggio. The door is closed, nothing to report. - We are waiting. - Tell them to wait. Squad car 21 Double sail 21 calls Squad car 21 wait on the place. Call Brigadier Bozzi. Brigadier Bozzi to operations room. Brigadier Bozzi. - So? - So nothing, nothing. She left the school at seven o'clock, she should be at home, but the phone is always busy. That's all l have to tell you. If you want more information you can ask the police directly. I do not know anything else. Ah Marh. So what? First they tore her into pieces and then they bashed her skull in. - But, did you find any prints? - Not at all. No, huh? - And how did he take it? - Let's not talk about it. Well, go get some rest. Go to sleep go. Thank you, l'll finish the report and leave. Bozzi told me everything. - And what about the forensics? - They found only this. What is it? A fragment of the statuette with which the killer cracked her skull, had remained in the hair. The statuette was not part of the furniture, so the killer brought it with him. What do you think it means? That the teacher knew the killer and that she let him in without having the slightest suspicion. Yes, it is so. - So, no fingerprints, huh? - No. But the murderer is always the same. Eh, quite a mess my lnspector. - Ouite a mess. - Marh, about the last two crimes, we carry them on our conscience. The killer knew the importance of the drawing. We had to imagine he wanted to erase everything. Eh, lnspector, in theory it's easy to prevent, but then instead, to put it into practice, you almost always get a fait accompli. But, that's exactly why! But, don't take it so hard, lnspector, don't be upset. You see, in our business it is not enough to be smart and maybe with a degree, is it? You have to have thick skin, like those in the morgue. By the way, do you know what they say up there? They say that if this case goes ahead at this pace, with corpses we can do a soccer team. Who dealt the Moroni case? Who is it? lt seems to me Pilone, yes. Well, see that we deal with it, l believe that for fair play it would be better to warn them. But, no, no, no, Pilone now can no longer bust our balls. Marh. I mean that he has been transferred. Inspector, continue with discretion, don't worry for the authorizations of the magistrate, the clamor of the press. I'll cover you, throw everything on top of me. Well l'd go for a few hours or so of sleep, because l'm a little tired. - Yes, go Marh. - lf you'll excuse me, eh. - Good night. - Good night. Good morning. Madam, l need to ask you some questions about Stefania. Stefania? Of course. It is necessary that Stefania try her dress. I made it a little larger, but the wool will shrink, then. And Stefy grows up so fast. She'll be back from school soon. Here she was four. Yes, she's really beautiful, congratulations. - They have informed me just now. - Good morning. I am Mrs. Lucchi, Oliviero Moroni's wife. My husband has just come back from the factory, Here he is, would you like to talk to me as well? Yes, to both of you. My husband. - Good morning. - Nice to meet you. Excuse me. I got them for you, Eleonora. You'll see, Stefania too will love them. Oliviero, the inspector would like to talk to you. Of course, please. I came to talk about Stefania with your sister-in-law. Where is Stefy? Stefy? Stephanie. Poor Eleonora, she has been like that ever since, no longer recovered. Inspector, why after so long? I was waiting for you to ask why the police, after a long time, reopened the investigation of a case which was already closed. If there is the slightest chance to discover something more, we are all at your complete disposal. Don't start over again, now. Oliviero lives in the memory of his brother. But why do you reproach me for it? l owe him everything. And what about him? You know that during the war he saved Alessandro's life? But what does this have to do with it? It's a thing belonging to the past now, shut up. No, if we have to tell the truth, let's face it all. Look, he even lost a hand. Not that Alexander was not grateful to him, quite the opposite, but, you see, it bothered him having to thank someone. Oliviero instead is different, he has always had for Alessandro an exaggerated affection. Look, for example, if the other relatives have spent - what you spent. - Carla, stop it. No, l want to tell the whole truth. Inspector, you know that Oliviero gave money to a leech, a charlatan, just because he had said to have evidence. He paid and the charlatan has disappeared. Is this true? Of course it is true, l didn't make it up. Go ahead, tell him. Come on, tell him. I admit it, but, excuse me, what would you have done? The police had already filed the case, then, one day, one who says he has evidence to get to murderers. - Was he called Paradisi? - Yes, l think so, l knew him little, he used to phone. You know, l used to pay him through the bank. - And then? - And then he disappeared. He has not disappeared, he has been killed. My God, this is not possible. - Good morning. - Good morning. Can we have a chat? Yes, please. Good morning. Please, please stay comfortable. How long have you been working here? She for a year and six months, the two of us for three years. - So you were already here when... - Yes. When the little girl was kidnapped. And, that afternoon, did any of you see Stefania in the garden? I brought her a snack ten minutes before. Ah. Was there someone else? Was there someone else? Me, but l was washing the car. Fine, we must try to reconstruct exactly what happened that day. Stefania! Stefania! Stefania! Stefania! Stefania! Stefania! Stefy! Stefania! Stefy! We looked for her everywhere, then the phone call arrived. Hello! The little girl is fine for now. If you want to see her alive again do not notify the police. Prepare 100 million in small bills. You will receive instructions by letter. It arrived the next day. "Tonight at kilometer 21 on highway 24" - Oliviero. - Yes? - You will go. - All right. No! No, l do not want to. It can be dangerous. Georgio and Beniamino have no one but you. There is no danger, Carla. Right, Alessandro? Of course. We thought Mr. Beniamino would offer himself, he was very attached to little Stefania. What does attached mean? Well, a sculptor, a particular guy, maybe in short a little strange. He used to demonstrate an impressive attachment. And who else used to accompany the little girl outside? A little bit everyone. But almost always Mr. Beniamino. They used to stay out for several hours. - And did you ever accompany her? - Well, l... - Yes, him too. - Did you often go out with Stefania? Yes, l was happy when l could do it. And where did you take her? To the zoo? To the countryside? Everywhere, even to the countryside. I had to take her away from the environment, at home she had no other choice than to be present to those terrible quarrels. My brother had a bad marriage. Why? What was happening? They were about to separate. They used to fight because Alessandro wanted the little girl with him, but my sister-in-law, supported by his brother, that snake Canavese, had come to blackmail him. Either the little girl or 100 million. - And how did your brother react? - He threw out Canavese. It was a mistake. A terrible mistake. What would you have done? I would have looked for an agreement, l would have come to a compromise, perhaps giving the custody of Stefania to someone in the family, maybe this would have avoided the irreparable. - Do you have any suspicions? - No. Then why did you pay a detective to discover the kidnappers of your niece? - How did you find out? - ls it true? Yes, l wanted to look into the face who was able to kill innocence. Come on, Donatella go to Mr. Beniamino. No, Donatella not now. She is a model. - Do you know Stefania's teacher? - Yes. She was the last victim. But on her the murderer left a clue, this. Can you tell me where it comes from? No, l've never seen it. Fine. Maybe l'll still need to talk to you. Alessandro's plan to discover the kidnappers failed. He was discovered while following the mediator, beaten to a pulp and kidnapped himself. So far the depositions, then we intervened. Police controls, check-outs in the area, agents in the surroundings of the villa and in the factory, we sifted the informers but the kidnappers unfortunately never showed up again. - Do you know what's the trouble, Marh? - Eh, if the trouble was only this one. Nobody remembers a damn thing anymore. This is the truth. Do you remember the interrogation? Depositions at the post office? To kill Mrs. Paradisi certainly was only one but one witness said he was blond and fat, another he was brown and thin, - go figure it out. - What do you want to understand. Go on, Silvestri, how did it end? We found the two corpses two months later by chance during a chase for a fugitive. Alessandro Moroni and his daughter had been imprisoned in a bunker and let die slowly of starvation. And what about this? Report number 700. Giorgio Canavese, 30 years old, brother-in-law, no precedent ascertained. He created from nothing a big company of international transport, lnterfrigo. With branches in many towns. Whose business is going too well. That guy should be squeezed. Who are you, what do you want, who let you in here? What are they doing on my trucks? Searching. - They won't find anything. - They will find. Tell him to keep quiet. Bad gorillas end up at the zoo. Tonight we got an anonymous report. Apparently your trucks do not only carry food but, well, l hope it's just smuggling. I understand. Considerable company. lt will have cost a fortune. One hundred million just to start. - None of your business. - You never know. In short can l know what do you want? Talking about your trouble. About two months ago you were caught red-handed in a brothel with two minors. Minors? With women, appearance deceives. But still l can make everything disappear. So, Mr. Canavese, will you return the favor? If it is a matter of money there are no difficulties. No, you just have to answer a few questions. It depends on what type of questions. Have you ever paid a certain Umberto Paradisi to discover the killers of Alessandro and Stefania Moroni? No, l paid only a guy who blackmailed me. Because he knew that his sister in agreement with you wanted 100 million with, to grant the divorce to Alessandro and renounce the little girl. Well, in short, when that guy came with the bullshit of being on the kidnappers' trail l thought he knew everything and wanted to extort some money from me and since l do not want the bother, you understand me, don't you? Of course. So, did you pay out of fear? And when did you see him for the last time? Well, three months ago, maybe more, here. Here are all the dates and all the figures. You know l am precise. Fine. Then you can answer with equal precision to this last question. - Where were you at dawn on June 7th? - Of course. When Paradisi was killed. I do not know. But, did Paradisi know what to look for? Maybe yes. What about us? No. It is encouraging. And the murderer? Not even. But, then why does he keep on killing? He wants to delete every trace and, since he doesn't know which one, he clears the streets. See Marh, the killer is sure that Paradisi had found a connection between him and the little girl, an insignificant thing perhaps, but enough to identify him and he believes that this evidence is in the hand of one of those people approached by Paradisi and then he is forced to kill to leave no witnesses. You see the teacher, Mrs. Paradisi, and so on. In essence, nobody knows anything, huh? Except the deceased which, as they say, questioned, did not answer. We could try with a seance. Yes sure, so at your place we put a medium. But rather l say, what did Paradisi, an amateur, want to get from the dredging of the swamp. Let's start over. Paradisi discovers the little girl's drawing and so finds the evidence that, just one week before the kidnapping, the little girl had already been in the meadow which is above the swamp. With whom? We cannot say if the investigator has sensed it. Anyway, when missing the ultimate evidence to nail the kidnappers, the one he was looking for in the swamp, Paradisi is killed, but in vain, because there is nothing in the swamp. That is sure, we have ascertained it at our expense, isn't it? We spent one million and what have we found? Half a quintal of condoms. And also there is another consideration. Why Paradisi did not warn the Moroni's about his researches in the swamp? It is at least strange that an investigator who is due to get money does not warn his backers that the goal is near. On this issue, either the Moroni's and Canavese lied, or Paradisi did not trust them. - But in short, conclusion? - None. We start from scratch, from the swamp. When they were found it was already too late, on Alessandro Moroni they found a skull fracture, therefore violent death, the little girl instead had died of starvation, hands and feet tied with an iron wire. And believe me, lnspector, among so many crimes l have seen, this is one of the most repugnant. Only clue, a rusty nail with a shiny tip, nothing else. - Good morning lnspector! - Good morning! We have come for the anniversary. Madam. I brought a vase for flowers, l'll get some water. Excuse me l would not want to disturb. Everything solved lnspector? We would like to know if you have discovered something! Of course! Of course! You have every right to do so. I have the certainty that Stefania before dying was able to launch an SOS. What do you mean by that? That the little girl tried desperately to save herself and launched a message. That's why we saw you throwing stones from the slit. But in short no one has ever succeeded to find anything and after a year you want to make us believe. If the inspector discovers something, he does so also in our interest. Now it remains to be seen what she threw and where it went. You believe that Stefania has been capable of so much before dying? Four people were killed for this opinion. Let's hope you will not be the fifth! Sorry. l'm sorry, but this evening l'm not there with my head. It doesn't matter, it can happen to everyone! I don't know, do you want us to talk about it? Is there something bothering you? Tell me. I launched the challenge to the killer and l regret it. Why? Because l'm sure he knows what that little girl threw through the slit. - Police headquarters. - Hello? Put me through Marh! - Dr. Peretti? - Yes. - Is there any news? - No. None. The suspect is under close surveillance half an hour ago he drove out by car, Petton and Salvadei are following him with the 125. Can we trust them? Yes, why not? They're smart. The other person drove out, he headed towards the suburbs. - With whom? - Alone, alone, there is Cardozzi who won't let him go! The third suspect instead is at home but if he moves don't worry l'm here. Inspector, by the way, where can l find you - at the usual number? - Yes, yes. All right, thank you and have a good rest. So, do you want a tranquilizer? No leave me alone! Imagine, in peace! peace of the senses! For you, there is only one thing you are interested in, the work. For the rest. Listen Anna, stop it! Please! With all the thoughts l have don't put yourself in it too! But, have you seen what you have become? Eh? Look at you. Look at yourself in the mirror. Only clue, a rusty nail with shiny tip. I should have thought of that right away, the same day l entered in that bunker, you know? Paradisi, on the other hand, was smart, he had understood everything, everything. Yes. Inspector, Petton and Salvadei have lost contact with that person. But how did they lose it? Didn't they follow him in the car? Give me Marh. Chief Marh is not here, he went to the place, he said... - But, go to hell. - What are you doing? Eh, yes, Paradisi was really smart, he had understood everything, just he didn't know that at the time of the kidnapping the swamp did not exist and he had deduced that, if the little girl had launched a message, this had to be at the bottom of the swamp. Therefore that morning he was there, with the excavator. Eh yes, how could he imagine that Mattia had collected it. I have to go to Mattia. Luca, Luca. Who is it? Who the fuck is it? Who are you? What do you want from me? Who knows you? But l, but l am a poor man, what do you want from me? I am a poor guy, what do you want from me? When you get bored, call me 3310457 Adele. One token. But, what do you want, it's closed. One token, please, it is urgent. Look at this pain in the ass. - Hello? - Hello, Adele? Yes, this is Adele Lodigiani, but who are you? I am lnspector Peretti, do you remember? No, l don't know you, who did you say you are? But, l am the policeman, the one that you met at Mattia's. - Ah, now l remember. - Where do you live? In via dei Glicini, 18. Are you alone in the house? Of course. You must not open the door to anyone, until l arrive. And listen to me well, among the stuff that Mattia gave you there should be a mirror. A mirror? l have a hundred of them. It should have a sign. What do you say? A sign? Wait, now l'll have a look. Adele? Adele, answer. Adele, answer, Adele. What's the matter with you? l heard a scream, what was it? Nothing, nothing. l cut myself with glass, but l found the mirror. Fine. Lock the door and do not open to anyone, can you hear me? Yes. Yes, l hear you, but be quick, it seems to me that l heard noises here below, l am scared. - Don't worry, do as l told you. - Yes. Hello? Hello. No, no. Adele. Do not worry about me, it is nothing. Adele, it's all over. You were very clever, you know? But now you don't have to be afraid anymore, give me the mirror. Stay seated Marh. Everyone stay seated. What l have to say concerns all of you, especially you. Throughout this story, what impressed me the most was your coldness, your cynicism. I have been several times about to discover you, but, each time, your lucid madness disoriented me. And even now, here, l feel you are safe, calm. You have foreseen everything, you think you have done everything perfectly, how perfect it may seem in appearance to your family. But in reality the only feeling that has always bound you was Alessandro's money, he realized and decided to get rid of you. The last card to play then was Stefania, the real weak point in the heart of Alessandro. You fought for her. You are also in the race and you have prepared a perfect plan, but me, with the help of Stefania, yes, Stefania herself, l have here the evidence that will condemn you. Once upon a time there was a little girl and every child who dies is as if the last fiower in the world dies. But what feeling can push to a crime like this? Hatred, but an absurd hatred, ruthless, insane, because the story of Stefania is also the story of your madness, my dear killer. You hated Alessandro Moroni and his power with the intensity of who has always cheated with himself and with others and you have coldly conceived the kidnapping and death of Stefania because you knew that, if ever you had returned her, she would have denounced you. And that's why you left her starving in the bunker and that is why once taken the father as hostage, you had to kill him how you killed Paradisi. Yes, Paradisi that investigating for the insurance had believed to find the means to get rich offering his services to all of you and, therefore, also to you. You paid him to know where you went wrong, but you killed him too soon and unnecessarily, how you unnecessarily killed the driver, Mrs. Paradisi, the teacher, Mattia, without knowing that Stefania had already condemned you, first with the drawing and then with this mirror. This is the evidence which Paradisi was searching for, here Stefania has imprisoned you forever. And now, l will show you the face of the killer. Bozzi, the light, now. Close the door, so no one gets out. Now! But who is it? Stop you two. No, Stefania. l said stop. No, do not hurt to my little girl, please. You do not try again, okay? Bozzi, where is he? Bozzi, where is he? - Don't move, Marh. - Yes, lnspector. Please, please, turn off the light. Don't be afraid, l will protect you. Keep quiet. Come with me. Light off. please turn off the light. Please, l do not want. I do not want you to look at me, l am ashamed. Please, leave me in the dark. Stefania still did not know to write, but at school she always used to get 10 in drawing. Yes, l killed her. I killed them all. Alessandro didn't love me anymore, had kicked me out. I, l had saved his life. His little girl also belonged to me. lt's mine, it's all mine. It is mine, it is mine. Marh, take him away.
