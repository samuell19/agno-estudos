Recess! Here goes! Catch! That's it! Block him! Marie... Better take the children inside. But why? Recess isn't over. Please, do as I tell you. Come on, children, let's go in now. I have a feeling, gentlemen, I can be of some help. Are you Martin Goddard? - Yes, I am. - And your real name is ferdinand Waldo demara Jr.‚Äù Yes, it is. Alias Dr. mornay, alias brother Joseph Jerome... That... that's enough. That's quite a list you've got. It's very impressive. Uh, I don't think those will be necessary. Anything you want in there? Yes, but nothing I can take with me. You know what day this is? Saint Valentine's day. Do you think the people on the island would spend one dollar to decorate the school, huh? Ah. Shall we go? Come on demara, let's get below. It's cold out here. You know something? I think you're afraid I can see the headlines now! "Full fathom five, the phony faker lies." I would never do that, you know why? It would make me look ridiculous. I'd never like that. Inside, Fred. Fred? Yeah. Watch your step. Watch it. Inside. Oh, that's very, very nice. Yes, my compliments to the captain. This will do fine. Mind sitting down? Not at all. Oh, please, now. I... That really isn't necessary. I mean, where could I go if I wanted to? Do you have the key? Well, in case it sinks, I won't... forget it. Thank you. My best. This is the nuttiest arrest I've ever made. How do you account for the guy? Ah. Mr. demara! - Late, Mr. demara? - Yes, father, but... The sixth grade is receiving their diphtheria shots this morning. Weren't you told to be a half hour earlier today? Yes, father, but I have an excuse. I know. I know. Ample, as usual, I'm sure. - I really do! - Is this it? Hmm? All this candy? I bought a box for everyone in the class. - It's a celebration! - Fred... Oh, I can tell you. You'll be the first to know, anyhow. Pa's getting his movie houses back! The whole chain! All four of them! You see, the man who took them over... Well, they need pa. They want him back now to manage the whole thing! Isn't that great? Are you sure about this, Fred? Well, they called him on the phone last night! He's in their office, right now, in conference. Uh, may I go now, father? They need me in there. Yes, yes. You may do. Hello, doctor. Good morning, sister. Owl! Here, Elsie. This should help. Oh, I should have come earlier. I bet nobody would have cried then. Hey rog, pass them down. Oh, you can go ahead now, doctor. They won't feel it now. Well, thank you. I decided to read up on these shots, last night, before I got mine. Oh, ow! Here, John. Dr. p.P.E. Roux was the first man to discover anti-toxin for diphtheria. Did you know that? He was a great biologist, Dr. roux. Not as great as pasteur, or Dr. elrich. - Did you know that? - Uh, just a moment. I'll take you next, Mr. demara. Roll up your sleeve. They actually had an anti-toxin 20 years before. Did you know that? But they didn't use it right away, isn't that crazy? They just didn't know what to do with it. Well, don't you worry, Fred. I know exactly what to do with it! Owl! Hil where's pa? Did you buy 22 boxes of candy from Mrs. pakula today? Yes. And charged them? And told Mrs. pakula that we were going to reopen all our old charge accounts at all the stores soon? Yes, ma. Where's pa? Freddie, come back here. Where did you get those shoes? Did you charge those, too? How much? Who's going to pay for them? They're paid for, Mary. I bought them for him last week. Well, he hated those work shoes so. What's wrong? Everything went all right, didn't it? Tell him. You've filled his head with dreams and foolishness. Now tell him the truth for once. Mrs. demara, please. Tell him. They offered... All they offered me, son, was a job. Not the chain. A job as a projectionist. You didn't take it, did you? I had to, son. Can't you see that? Pa? Pa, it doesn't matter. We'll go back. Someday we'll go back to our home. Pa, we will, won't we? Answer him. Please, tell him the truth! No, son. We're never going back. Fred... You know the... The most difficult part of growing up is learning to be realistic. To understand that we just don't always get what we want out of life. Whether we like it or not, sometimes we have to settle for less. And that's just what your father's had to do. Why? Why what, son? Why does my father have to settle for less? Why does anybody have to? Well, because it's a fact, son. It's a hard fact of life. I'm one of those people like your father who had to settle for less. That's right. When I was just about your age, I wanted to be a trappist monk. I don't know why I wanted it. I think I told myself there is the toughest, the strictest order in the church. Try that. I entered a trappist monastery, and I lasted two years, but I just didn't have what it takes. So I ended up doing what I'm doing today, being a parish priest. It's god's work and it's good work, but it's not being a trappist. Certainly isn't what I dreamed of. But if you wanted it bad enough, you could've stayed. You should've stayed. Oh, come on! What I'm trying to tell you is that I couldn't be what I wanted to be and I had to face that fact! Now you can't go on living in dreams! You just can't, Fred! Now or when you grow up! It's not dreams! Ah, look. My pa, he's not gonna be in that job forever. He's just not! You're not only a dreamer, Fred, but you're a bad listener. I think you and I are gonna have to have more talks. A lot more. Sooner or later, Fred, you're gonna have to... Face facts! You've got to face facts, soldier! This board cannot approve your application for officers candidate school! I'm sorry, that's it demara. Dismissed. Uh, but sir, didn't I pass the written exams? You know you passed, demaral your marks happen to be the highest of the 400 men who took the test! Then why didn't I qualify? Because it says right here, in your handwriting on your application that you had only two years of high school. Sir, I quit school because it was too slow and I could learn faster on my own! Sir, I tell you what, why don't you test me? Test me on anything you like! On tactics, strategy... Soldier! Nobody is denying your zeal or your talent, but you've read the regulations! Minimum requirement ocs applicants, high school diploma, one each, that's it! Rules! We have to obey them, so do you. Just face that one simple fact. Dismissed! But sir, uh... Next! Private demara reporting, ma'am. That'll be all for tonight, lorrie. We'll get to it the first thing in the morning. Fred, I'm sorry. It's as simple as that. Whose side are you on, anyway? Yours and you know it, but there are rules and regulations. Now, look. Uh-hmm? You know I'd make a good officer. - Uh-hmm. - I know I'd make a good officer, and they know it. Face facts, soldier! Well here's a fact, major tirdell! Most of the guys I took the test with were college graduates with strings of degrees after their names and I beat them! I beat them alll I tell you, Cindy, it just doesn't make sense to me! - No sense at all! - I know. It isn't fair, and I know better than anyone! Look at these, college catalogues. Do you know they've got me writing away, begging them to accept direct commissions, just because they have two little letters after their name. Look. Edward j. Barrier, b.S., John w. Newcross, a.B., m.A., Lloyd Gilbert... Robert Lloyd Gilbert, a.b., m.A., ph.D., ll.D., research fellowship at Yale. They're gonna make him a general, at least a general! Fred? Fred demara, reporting for duty, sir. A.b., m.A., ph.D., ll.D., research fellowship at Yale. Demara, we've just looked over your qualifications and we've decided to make you a general. A general? I don't deserve it. Yes, you do, because you're a remarkable man, and on top of everything else, we're gonna send you - to the Pentagon. - The Pentagon? I don't deserve the Pentagon! Yes, you dol! Lieutenant, rules and regulations! You're not allowed to molest enlisted personnel, but with you I'll make an exception. You want to know something? Uh-hmm? I'm still gonna become an officer. You wait and see, sir. - Alberts! - Herel - bledsoe! - Herel - Burke! - Here! - Cameron! - Here! - Clark! - Herel - Collins! - Herel demara! I demara, demara, f.W.! Demara f.W., a.b., m.A., ph.D., research fellow at Yale. Only wonder to me demara, is how one of the other services didn't grab you first. They tried to sir, but I wanted to be a marine. Good! We most certainly want you. Thank you, sir. With your qualifications, demara, I see no purpose in officers candidate school. This board will recommend an immediate direct commission. Thank you, sir. The rest is routine. Running your paperwork through channels, the normal security check, usually takes a few weeks. - Oh, you have to check, sir? - Merely routine. When your papers go to Washington, they're processed automatically by the f.B.I. The f.B.I.? Dismissed. You will be notified, demara. Dismissed! Yes, sir! Excuse me. Fred w. Demara, may he rest in peace! My only regret, he's got only two or three lives to give to his country. Halt! Who goes there? Halt! "I hereby confess I entered the marine corps illegally after I went awol from the army. My usefulness to my country is forever over. I can't face the disgrace. This is the only way out. "F.w. Demara." Leaving on track three, west point, cornwall, luneburg, highland, Kingston, catskill, verbena, and Albany. Excuse me, can you tell me the name - of your order? - We're the holy cross. Oh, the holy cross. Wonderful, yes. Well, uh, thank you again. You're more than welcome. Robert Lloyd Gilbert, ph.D. Research fellow at Yale. Does Dr. Gilbert have an appointment? Uh, no, your eminence. A courtesy call. He's just passing through the city. Well, show him in, monsignor. Dr. Gilbert. Thank you. - Your eminence. - Dr. Gilbert. I must say, doctor, considering your scholarly attainments, I hardly expected, uh... A marine private? A youngish marine private at that? Yes. Both most surprising. Uh, will you sit down? Thank you. Uh, I'm here, your eminence, to steal, so to speak, a little of your time, a little of your advice. If I can be of any assistance, doctor, you're most welcome. Thank you. Um, your eminence, I'm not a catholic, but I've long admired your church and scholars like yourself. I've read several pieces that you've done. Papers, monographs, manuscripts... - Have you, doctor? - I've both enjoyed them and have been instructed. Thank you. What particular piece did you read? Uh, for the most part, the manichean heresy. - Oh. - Yes. During my researches at Yale, I became interested in it, and to my delight I found it was a scholarly pursuit of yours. Uh, do you mind very much if I smoke? - Please do. - Thank you very much. Cigarette? No. Thank you. I prefer cigars. Why, thank you. Excellent. Genuine Cuban, doctor. - Atchay oopman. - Hmm. A little indulgence, I permit myself. No, no. Hmm. Madera, sun-grown wrapper. This shade-grown stuff. You were saying, doctor... The manichean heresy. Oh, yes. Um, you see, your eminence, I've come to the conclusion that manichaeism is still with us, 15 centuries later, gone underground, so to speak, in our material world, but still with us, nevertheless. You're right. It may have done just that. I have a few books arguing that very point. I'd love to see them. You've possibly yourself have come across them in the course of your studies. Possibly. Now let me see. I'm sure they're here somewhere. I remember putting them away myself. It's strange the way things are always disappearing around here. Ah, here it is! This is marvelous. Marvelous! It's not often we get a ph.D. Seeking entrance into our order. And these letters of recommendation that preceded you, doctor, most laudatory. Especially this one from cardinal mullany. That's a forgery, Abbot. Only in the sense that the good and generous cardinal forged compliments far beyond my actual accomplishments. Everything else seems to be in order. Honorable discharge from the marines, also a forgery, I presume? Uh, you'd be surprised how easily they can be procured. Yes, black marketeers sell them to prospective a-w... l's in and about all the, uh, military bases. I can believe you. It's a sorry world. That's why I'm here, Abbot, to give up that world and start my life as a contemplative. Uh, I've learned that I'm no soldier and I find that the world and its wars are futile and inhuman. We're almost as inhuman here, but for a different purpose. Do you know what it entails to be one of us? I've read a bit, sir. Ours is an order of strict observance. We never touch meat, eggs, or fish. We arise at 2:00 am in the black of night to a day of contemplation, prayer and hard labor. The meals, though meager, are enough to sustain a man. Most difficult is that all these privations must be endured in silence. You will find, doctor, that the need to talk becomes an obsession far greater than food, sleep, or privacy. I can believe that, father. I admit to being quite a conversationalist. We have also a chapter of faults, wherein we publicly confess our secret failures, sins, transgressions. Until you are baptized in your new faith, you will be confined to visitor's quarters. After that you will enter a novitiate of two years. At the end of those two years, your superiors will tell you whether or not they feel you have a genuine vocation. Brother John will show you to your quarters. God's grace go with you. I accuse myself of stealing. Whenever I'm on kitchen duty, I steal crusts of bread from the plates of my brother monks. Worst of all, during the hours of contemplation I find myself dreaming of... Gravy, potatoes, steaks, salads, pastry, and how much I miss them. That's all father. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. Chesterton said it first, "nothing succeeds like failure." And if you think hard on it, he has something there. Actually, there's very little any of us learn from success. But there is merit in failure, if we use it. I didn't want to fail. I tried hard. I really did. Yes, you did. And you did well. But as we agreed, few are cut out for the silent life. There are so many ways to serve. Goodbye, Abbot. Good luck and god go with you. Thank you. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Could I have a lift? Climb in, feller. Um, oh, what you got back there? Fertilizer. Fertilizer? Yeah. Fertilizer. Always room for more. Always room for more. Boy, I like that stuff. Poor boys. Can't even have a drink. You was one of them? Uh, yes. I was. Oh. Here take a pull on this. Mountain dew. Uh, no. Thank you. Can't hurt you none, boy. It's home-made. And good for what ails you. Here. Watch me. Here. Take the cork, huh. Take it. Oh, thanks. Ah! Ahhh! That sure makes a man feel right with the world. Go on, you want to feel better, don't you? Try a sip. Go on. Go on. It's good for you. All right. Thank you. See? See, I told you. Feel better already, I bet. Don't you? - Yeah. - See? I know you would. Hey, take another swig now and join the world. It's your coming out party. Uh-hmm. - You made this yourself? - Uh-hmm. Medicine, medicine. Been slow-sippin' the stuff my whole life. Quart a day. Never felt a ripple. Never a ripple. Owl! It doesn't smell so bad anymore. Geronimo! Hey, boy! Boy! We got company! State police! I love your truck. Boy, I think you're drunk! - Nah. - I said I'm about to drive! Give me that wheel! - Give me that wheel! - Look out! There's a car. Oh. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Everything all right? - Just fine! Had a marvelous night. Thank you. You eatin' double again, mister! Well, waste not, want not. Hm. Do you suppose you could, uh, tear yourself away from the groceries long enough to come out to the office for a minute? Right now? Ain't nobody gonna steal your food, boy. All right. Uh, we won't be too long? I don't want it to get cold. No. It'll be all right. Uh, did your wife do the cooking? If she did, it's excellent. I got one suggestion I'd like to make. You have visitors. Ferdinand Waldo demara, Jr. These men are from the f.B.I., doc. They came in answer to our teletype. It's too bad you didn't tell us how important you was. The war may be over Mr. demara, but the army has some unfinished business with you. And the marines. Well, you see... I can really ex... Hey, Barney! What? I've told you three times today you're running too heavy on the ink. - Oh, come on. - What do you mean - "come on"? - Too much, too little! - So, what do you want? - I want it just right! I don't want too much or too little, okay? Here. What do you think you're running the New York times? - Demara? - Right? Warden wants to see you. Be right there. Hey, demara, tell your pal the warden I want out, too. Tell him I've been in here longer than you have. Tell him I've had it up to here. Why don't you go tell him yourself? - His door is open even to you. - What, are you kiddin'? He's a cop! I can't stand cops. Army kind or any other! - They're all finks. - You know, Barney, you know what's wrong with you? You're incorrigible. What? Forget it. Tell you what you do. Why don't you sit down and rest your brains for a couple of minutes? Finks! The whole world's full of nothin' but mahoneys and finks! You've come a long way in 18 months, Fred. With your help. Without it I'd probably have to serve my full term six years. I'm very grateful. Well, you just remember this, Fred. We're all our brother's keeper. Inside prison walls or out, each one of us, with responsibility each to each. What you just said, sir, I'd like to print that and more on the editorial page of the stripes and bars. And I thought I'd do an interview on warden Ben w. Stone. - No, no... - Now, now, I know how you feel about publicity but it's not really publicity. Um, we're here to talk about you, Fred. Not me. Sir, I feel I have a responsibility to my fellow inmates and I want you to let me make them aware of your kind of understanding. You know your method of handling people. You mean the simple code I try to follow? Yes, sir. I want that, but I want more. I want everything. When and where you were born. Uh, the schools you went to. How it all started. The day you decided to go into prison work. You mean you want the Horatio alger story, huh? - Yes. - Ben w. Stone, Georgia farm boy to army penologist. Is that where you were born, sir, in Georgia? - May I borrow this pad? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Altoona, Georgia. Population 435. I was a piccolo player in the grade school band. Really? The altoona high school. Good old atoona high. If anybody had said to me then I'd end up in penology I'd have said they was out of their mind! Summin' it all up, Fred, a man's personal dignity must never be taken away from him. Under most circumstances, you treat a man with respect, you'll get respect back. Even the most desperate man will respond to understanding. Sometimes it's only the simple understanding of giving him a way out with honor. Great day in the morning, I've been talking almost an hour. Haven't even started on you. Now have you decided what you wanna do when you get out of here? Yes, sir. Uh-hmm. I've decided. I've, uh, I definitely decided and as usual, you've been most helpful, sir. Can't tell you, Mr. stone, how happy I am to have a man of your background and experience being willing to join our staff. Well, thank you, sir. It's very nice to be here. I didn't realize, warden Chandler, what a tremendous plant you've got here. It's the largest prison in the southwest. Really? Still with some of the largest problems, - I'm sorry to say. - Well, from what I can see, sir, you're handling those problems in a most enlightened operation. Well, for the most part, I'm proud of what I've been able to do here - with one exception. - What's that, sir? I saved that for last. Right over here. Good afternoon, brown. Good afternoon, warden. Lieutenant brown this is Mr. Ben stone. - Howdy, do? - Howdy do. Mr. stone is joining my personal staff. Quiet today. So far, sir. Open up. Open up. Here's my problem, Mr. stone. Maximum security. Possibly the toughest cell block in the entire country. Most of the cells occupied? Every one. It's quiet. Too quiet. That's 'cause it's daytime, Mr. stone. Now at night, these boys turn into moon howlers. You get used to the sound, though. Takes a few years. We handle them though. It's about all we can do is handle them. That's the pity of it. And isolating them is the only thing you've been able to come up with, sir? It is the only practical thing we've been able to come up with, I'm sorry to say, Mr. stone. I can't accept that. It's against everything I believe. Sir, no man is beyond help. Even the most desperate of prisoners can be reached. You respect his dignity as a man, you know, you kind of treat him as a... - As a human being... - Uh-hmm. He must respond. He's got to respond. I agree with that, too. Then I come up against these men and their code of maximum. Code of maximum? - The Mark of distinction... - Oh, yes, yes, of course. That goes with being sent to maximum. It labels a man tough. And stayin' tough is the code. - Yes. - No man will violate it for fear of showin' weakness in the eyes of the others. When a man goes into maximum, he goes in there to stay! There's not one of them down there would ask for or accept any help. That's gettin' soft. Uh, that's, uh, breaking the code. Yes, sir. I can understand that, but... Now, no arguments, daddy. You're coming home right this minute. Eulalie, can't you see I'm busy? You have missed dinner twice this week! You are coming home with me right now if I have to drag youl! Mr. stone, this ill-mannered young lady, I'm sorry to say, is my daughter. How do you do, Ms. Chandler? Eulalie, honey, this is Ben w. Stone. What... you can't be Ben stone. What do you mean he can't be? An ex-army warden should be fat, 50, and ugly as sin! And you're not that at all, are you, Mr. stone? I do hope you like it here! Yeah. I'm sure I will, ma'am. Wait in the car. I'll see you in 10 minutes. Uh, yeah. I'll wait in the car. Now, 10 minutes, you said? If you don't want me back up here screamin'. Please, eulalie. Awfully nice meeting you, Mr. stone. I hope to see you again, real soon. So hice meeting you, ma'am. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, Mr. stone, what are you doing for dinner tonight? Uh, daddy and I insist that you join us for dinner. Don't we, daddy? Good. Then it's settled. I'll bring my car out to the front of the building and I'll pick you both up there. - Fine. - Fine. - Bye. - Goodbye. Of course, I meant for you to bring Mrs. stone, too. Well, there isn't a Mrs. stone. Isn't that nice? Well, uh, bye. - Goodbye. - For now. Yes. Charming. So what is the percentage of, uh, prisoner trusties? - Oh, I'd say about 12%. - Excuse me, sir. But how long have you been a warden? - Uh, 14 years. - Oh, really? Get in. Get comfortable now. - Hi. - Hi, there. Good. You're prompt. You see, you're helping daddy already. Ha. Where will you be working, Mr. stone? I don't rightly know, it's completely up to your father, Ms. Chandler. Well, Ben, I've been thinking it over. You ought to give it a try. Maximum security, it's yours. Maximum? But daddy, you can't do this. Well, you can get killed there. Only last month a couple of guards were stabbed! Now, now, eulalie. Mr. stone is an experienced penologist. Come on. Come on, drive us home now. May I have your stick? Oh, don't get too close to that door, sir! They'll bring you to 'em. These boys like to play at bangin' your head against all that iron. Oh, thank you, r.C. How often do you let them out of the cells? Once a day, sir, they get a few minutes to stretch out here in this corridor, one man at a time. Only one man at a time? You'll learn, sir. Put a pair of them rocknoses together, they'd soon kill us or each other. - Yeah. - Uh, just a moment, sir. Back off there, man. I said back off there! Now, there's a rocknose for you. I uh, look, uh, Mr. stone, you seem like a nice bright young fella. I'd sure hate to see you get all chewed up down here. Now, uh, why don't you ask the warden to let you work in that nice air-conditioned office of his, hmm? Be a lot cooler, and a whole lot safer. Believe Mel you'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, I'm only thinking of you, sir. Yeah. I can see that. What's this prisoner's name? Thompson, sir. - First name. - Uh, Clifford Thompson. He's the meanest, sir, you'd better stay away from him. - Open up the door. - Now, look, Mr. stone... Do as I tell you, r.C.! Open up the door! Lift the bar. Did you hear me? I said lift the bar! Hi, Clifford. Kind of close in here, isn't it? I'll tell you, Clifford, I don't think I'm gonna like this job very much. No, I'm not. Best thing I could do is to... Clear all you boys out of this cell block as quickly as possible. I'll tell you what's stumping me, though. I heard a rumor that a lot of you boys don't want to get out of maximum. Well, that's kinda hard to believe, isn't it? Tell you what I'd like to do. Any man that wants out of maximum, all he's gotta do is ask. That's all, just ask. There are gonna be clean cells and decent shop jobs in the main prison for any man who can prove to me that he'll keep his nose clean and kinda behave himself. Well, that's all, Clifford. Why don't you kinda think over what I said. In fact, why don't you, uh, you talk it over with the other boys here in maximum and kinda talk it amongst yourselves. Like how you buck-tailed, screw?! By telephone?! Easy, Clifford. Everything's gonna be fine. I was gonna come to that. Startin' today and twice a day from now on, all the men here in maximum are gonna be let out in the corridor together. You'll be just about free to do anythin' you want. You know what I mean, like, uh, smoke, or take a walk, or just even talk. Take care, Clifford, you hear? You can save yourself some time. I want 'em all open. Now, look here, Mr. stone, you can't do that. - No? - No, anything at all is liable to spook these boys into a riot. Uh-hmm. Well, fine. I want you to open all the cells. Now, just a minute, Mr. stone. Do as I tell you, r.C.! Open 'em up. All of them. Comin', Mr. stone? Where? Why, outside, man! - Why? - Because armed guards ain't allowed to come in contact with those boys! They could jump us, take our guns! I haven't got a gun, sir! Tell you what you can do, though, you can take off your gun and join me here if you wish. No thank you, sir. It's your party. All right. Lift the bars. All right, boys. You can come out now! There are gonna be some new rules. I've just had a talk here with cliff Thompson. He can... he can tell you all about the rules I was telling you about. Men, come on out. There's gonna be a 30-minute recess. Either he's the bravest man I ever saw... Or the biggest dang fool that ever lived! We'll find out soon enough. Cliff! Pass those around. Hi, r.C. Is Ben stone... Inside with his boys, sir. How're you, Dr. Hammond? Oh, fine, r.C., and you? Oh, a little jumpy these days, sir. I understand some changes have been made around here. You'll see it with your own eyes, sir. I don't know if you could call it. Maximum security anymore. Hold it. Now, Clifford, why aren't you doing the exercises? This here is one monkey don't put on a show for no buck-tailed, short-horned screws. That's solitary talk, Mr. stone! That man's beggin' for a week in the pipe. Now, just a minute, r.C. My, my, my, Clifford. The language you can use sometimes, you know, what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to write your mother a letter. Now, now, now, Clifford, Clifford. Don't you think it's about time we had a break? - I think so. - Um, good. Cigarette? There you go. It's a break. Ben? Ben, Dr. Robert Boyd Hammond. Meet Mr. Ben stone. - Ben. - How do you do, doctor? Dr. Hammond is the Dean of the school of psychology - at our state university. - I see. Now and again he stops and gives us some advice and some help. - I want you two men to meet. - I'm delighted. I like the way you handled that, Ben. Why thank you very much, doctor. - Thank you. - And Ben, would you join us in my office? Why certainly. Certainly. R.c. Uh, will you take over, please? Um... Gently. Doc, we're gettin' more new prisoners than we can handle. Unfortunately too many of the same faces. Hi. Hey, screw, sir. That last guy goin' up the steps. Who is he? That's, uh, Ben w. Stone. Who? Ben w. Stone. He's, uh, the warden's right-hand man. Why, do you know him? Me? Now, how would a guy like me know a fink like him? Huh? Come on, move. I tell you, I'm still up against this stupid, stubborn resistance. Ben, you're impatient. Actually, you've accomplished a tremendous amount in eight weeks. - I'd say so. - It don't think so. You got the men exercising, reading, Ben's even got some of the boys writing home. The illiterate one's he's teaching to write. You've got the men busy and involved and not a real case of trouble in weeks. I'd call that genuine progress. Don't get discouraged, Ben. You're earning the men's trust. That takes time, a lot of time. If I could get just one man, just one man to break the code, I'm... Oh, there you are. I've been waiting in your office for 15 minutes, Mr. Ben w. Stone. Hello, Dr. Hammond. Eulalie, how are you? I'm hungry. I had a date for dinner and a movie. Dr. Hammond's my alibi, honey. It's mostly my fault, eulalie, but, uh, we've been busy... I know, talking shop, talking maximum. Well, uh, do we... That's maximum security. Come on, doc. - All right. What happened? - It's Thompson, sir. He wouldn't go back in his cell after the exercise. Actually, he got a knife, stabbed me. Where did he get the knife? I don't know, sir. Now you hear me, men. Get back in those cells. Open up. I want to talk to Thompson. Open up. Ben, be careful. I got nothing on you but I'll cut you. I tell you, before we talk this over, why don't you hand me that knife? - Hand you? - Uh-hmm. I can't give you the knife, that's asking too much. Suppose that... Suppose I took it from you. Would that be fair? Yes, sir, that's fair. Come get it. Ben. Let me use the gas, warden. Stay out of this, r.C.. Careful, Ben. Careful. Ben, we're coming in. No, stay where you are. Take it, Ben. Take it. I'm trying to. Wake up, man. Wake up. All right, all right, all right, Clifford. All right. You, you all right, Clifford? Um... Yeah, I'm all right. Right. Fine. Come on, men. Go on back to your cells. Let's go. All right. You too, Clifford. Go ahead. Um, I ain't going to solitary? Why should you go to solitary? It was fair fight, wasn't it? Yeah. There's somebody calling. Ben? - Hello, Ben? - Yes, sir. Guess who just left my office? Thompson. He asked out. He wants to go to work in the carpenter shop. That's great, sir. You come up here to my office. I got a new job, a new title, and more money. You're the deputy warden. I'll be right up, sir. Oh, Ben, Ben. Oh, sorry, sir. I didn't mean to... Oh, that's all right. What can I do for you? I got one of the new prisoners here, sir. He wants to talk to you. Says it's urgent. Um... All right. I'll see him. - Oh, no, not now. - Eulalie, I've got to see him. When these men want to see me, - I just must. - Well, see him tomorrow. No, I'm not gonna be able to do that. But we've got to get to daddy's office. I'll meet you up in daddy's office in just a couple of minutes. Now, you just go on up there - and I'll meet you... - Ben... I'll see you up at the office, eulalie. The office. - Bye. - Bye. Hiya, Freddie boy. - Listen, Barney... - You will listen. I will talk. Well, I always wanted a friend on the inside - but this... this is ridiculous. - Sit down. For a friend, I get me the assistant warden. Barney. You haven't heard me out yet, Freddie boy. Now... No thanks. Now, I'm not gonna blow the whistle on you, Freddie boy unless you make me. All it ask is, uh, - a favor here and there. Yeah? - Yeah. What kind of favor did you have in mind, Barney? Well, I haven't figured that out yet but, uh, big, small, I don't know but, uh... Yeah, well, I'll be thinking about it. You be thinking about it too. Uh, maybe we can come up with something. Well... Well, that's all, Freddie. Nice set-up. Yes. Come on up here, Ben. We're all waiting on you. Be right there, sir. Yep. Uh, but I don't know. You know f.W. Demara, he's such a... he's such a nobody. And worst of all, he's a terribly dull man. Well, he needn't be, you said yourself that first night you came back that everywhere you went people like you and you like people. No, they didn't like me. They like who I was and what I was doing. And I'll tell you something. I even like me then. Taking other people's names and lives? You can't meant that, Fred. But it's part of the fun and the excitement. Waiting for them even to got wise to you is part of the fun. I guess that's kind of hard for you to understand, isn't it? Yes, it is. It's very hard. When I know that with your talent and brains, you could've been doing some good, a lot of good. But I was doing good, or trying to anyway. All I did was take a few shortcuts. I don't think I hurt anybody. Now you hurt Fred demara. Now, father devlin, you're getting to sound like a psychiatrist. Hmm, well, as a matter of fact, I was reading a book on psychiatry last night. - Oh, no, not you. - Yes, indeed. - Oedipus complex. - Look, it doesn't - make me an expert. - Come on, I'll buy you a drink. Father, you shouldn't read books like that, it's not good for you. That's still Freud and I'm not gonna let you sell me Freud. I would sell you anything if I thought it would make you understand yourself. Uh-hmm. Have you ever thought of consulting a psychiatrist? Uh, in prison, the army assigned me one of their best. It was fascinating. But he couldn't tell you anything? Well, wait a minute. He told me a lot. He told me I had a wonderful childhood. It lasted almost 30 years. That's where it all began in my childhood. He called it a lesion to my narcissism which simply means I never liked me very much. But I could have told him that the minute we shook hands. You know, all those guys are trying to do is just take the fun out of life? Be yourself. Life is real. Life is earnest. Now where's the fun in that? Well, if you knew that, my church would be overflowing. I've got to get back to the rectory. Oh, no, this is your treat. Thank you. I'm stubborn, Fred. I'm going to keep praying for you. We'll, you do that. You know what I'm really praying for? What's that? That one of these days you'll meet a girl, a fine girl and fall deeply in love with her. You keep praying because I'd like that myself. To be truly in love, you'd have to be honest. Not only with the girl but with yourself. - Goodbye and good luck. - Goodbye. Thank you. Oh, Fred... Wherever you go, god keep you in the hollow of his hand. The royal Canadian Navy welcomes you, Dr. mornay. Thank you, commander. I want you to know, sir, how much we appreciate your giving up such a fine practice. Not at all. As a matter of fact, I could use a sea voyage. That'll come later but first it's shore duty at the naval hospital at halifax. Oh, at the hospital. I see. - After you, doctor. - Thank you. Halifax, I've always wanted to go to halifax. Well, as you can see, we get the same junk here that - any of civilian hospital gets. - Uh-hmm. Concussion, severe laceration, compound commutated patella, perforated appendix, fractured, uh... Mandible. Yes, mandible. Fractured mandible. Third degree burns, you know, - the usual sort of thing. - Uh-hmm. Mornay, would you like some advice? Well, actually I would, you see, I'm rather new to this. To this? Well, I don't mean to this. - This is easy. - Oh. I mean how you can hand in solid with the old man, chief of medicine. Well, how would you do that? Well, if I were you, I'd let the old man know that you had read everything that he'd written - in the lancet. - Uh-hmm. The phenomenon of the middle ear. Wonderful. The kidney, it's function. You loved it, - every one of them. - Yeah. You see, the old man has a... Compulsion to rush into print. He fancies himself quite a writer. Somewhat like a psychoanalyst in that respect. Uh, uh, excuse me, uh, where did you say I read them? Oh, come off it. The lancet. The British medical journal. Oh, the British, yes. That Montgomery. - Oh, yes, yes. - Yes. Dr. Johnson, report to surgery, please. Lieutenant surgeon Burke, call the desk, please. I assume all the medication and treatment for these men was prescribed by Dr. Thornton. Yes, doctor. Is there anything wrong, doctor? Wrong? Absolutely not. You will continue everything as prescribe by Dr. Thornton with my complete approval. Uh, nurse... I know a real doctor when I've seen one, you know, and from what I've seen, we can thank heaven for Dr. Thornton. Yes. Well, carry on, nurse. Tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis. Girls. Posterior, posterior, posterior. Posterior antl... It's the most underrated flower in the whole world. Most flowers taper to the top. That's very common but a dandelion, it kind of spreads out as it grows. That's very unusual. I like them because they're so sturdy... And reliable. I'm from out west, saskatchewan. We could never depend on anything there. A sudden snow would come or a freeze and... All the flowers would die. But then when the snow melted away, there they were, the dandelions. When we were kids, we used to play that if you could blow off all the fluff off a dandelion, it would mean you would get your wish. We used to say it meant you were in love. Oh, no. No. Forgive me but that's wrong. No. You see, you'd hold the dandelion under someone's chin and if it makes the chin all yellow then you're in love. Did you know you were in love? And I've been deeply in love for minutes. We're going to have lunch together. A small place, a French place. I want you to know I've had the most wonderful afternoon of my life. Yes, I have too. - L'addition. - Oui, m'sieu. Allens, m"sieu. Merci, beaucoup, m'sieu. Oh, wait, wait, before we go, there's something I want to tell you. Uh, I'm not really a, uh, well, no... - My name might... - No. No, don't. I want to save that. I want to fall in love and... Not even know my lover's name. Well, that would be fun, normally, but you've got... - Do you know what I'd like? - What? I'd like to run into someone when we walk out of here today, someone like... My chief of staff and say, "sir, I'd... Like you to meet the man I love,". Lieutenant, lieutenant, what is your name, lieutenant? Well, Fred, where are you? Never mind that. Would you do me a favor? Would you stop praying for me? Stop praying? What are you talking about? Are you all right? I'm fine but you know, what happened to me? I meet her. The girl you told me about. I'm in love. Fred, that's wonderful. What's so wonderful about it? It's all wrong. I've tried to tell her what kind of a phony I am but she just won't listen. Fred, you've got to tell her. She's got to listen. Father, I've tried. She won't and she can't. She's in love too. Fred. Father, please, I'm in pain. Fred. Father, do me a favor. Uh, will you say hello to ma and pa for me? Give them my very best. Tell them I'm okay. What are you going to do? I don't... I don't know what I'm going to do but you can do me one favor, though. Please don't pray for me. Fred, don't hang up. How could you do this to me, Joe? Without telling me. Catherine, will you listen to me? Oh, don't, Joe. The head nurse told me you not only begged but... Then you plagued the chief of medicine to send you to Korea at once. Well, that's true. Yes, it's true but... Well, there's something you must know about me. Joe, nothing matters now expect that I love you and I was foolish enough to think that you loved me. But I do love you. Catherine, I've never loved anybody else but you. Will you listen to me now? I'm... Uh, well... During the last war, someone in my family, someone very close to me was a deserter. Now for years now I've... Wanted to wipe out the shame and the guilt. And until that's done, I'm no good to you, to me, or to anybody else. All right, Joe. I'll wait for you... Because I love you. I'll wait for you forever. Catherine, what can I say? Say this after me. Catherine, I'm coming back to you. I love you... And when I come back, I'll marry you. Catherine, I'm coming back to you. I love you... - And if I come back... - Not if, when. And when I come back, I'll marry you. - You're the new doctor. - Yes, sir. Come at once to the captain's cabin. - The captain's? - The old man's in terrible pain. Come on, doc. Excuse me. God help us all. He's never been on a ship before. Come on, doc. Captain, here's your new surgeon lieutenant... Never mind that. I'm glad to see you, doc. I've got a bloody tooth to get out here. Come on, let's get cracking, huh. Would you mind opening your mouth, sir? Ah. Uh, which tooth is it, sir? Well, it's this one right here. The medical assistant said it was abscessed. He was afraid to fool with it so we waited for you. Uh-huh. He did, huh? Um, well, that tooth will have to come out. Well, hurry up, will you, doc? Yes. Yes. I'll, uh, I'll have it out in a jiffy, sir. You just relax and don't worry about a thing. I'm just gonna go check the equipment and see that we've got everything that we'll need for the extraction. Well, hurry up, will you? No. No. It slides. So it does. Excuse me. - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you the medical assistant? Yes, sir, uh, hotchkiss, sir. - Uh, Dr. mornay. - How do you do, sir? Uh, have you seen the captain yet, sir? Yes. I was just there. I'm just going back. Tell me, hotchkiss, uh, have you had any experience with extractions? Well, uh, um, no, sir. No. Well, I've got to check something. Oh, there's nothing for you to check, sir. I have everything right here. Uh, the instruments, syringe, novocain, uh, everything. Uh-hmm. Fine. Why don't you take them up to the captain's quarters? I'll meet you up there presently. - Go on up immediately. - Yes, sir. Make him as comfortable as possible. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Extraction. Extraction. Extraction. Extraction. Doc. I'll be right there. Well, what's the trouble in there? Got it. Right. Be right there. Well, step on it, will you? The old man's ready to blow up. Yeah. I'm coming. I'm coming. Well, let's go. Here he is, captain. I'm sorry I took so long, sir. Please, doc. Hurry. I will, it will. Thank you. Uh, do you have much pain? Yes, I do. Uh, well, I'll be with you in a jiffy. You just relax, sir. You just be calm now and relax. Thank you. - Uh, say, "ah." - Ah. Ah. I'm sorry. Uh-hmm. Syringe. - Ah. - Ah. Feel it? - Ah. - Oh. I'm sorry. Yes. Hold on. Syringe. - More? - Yes. Shh. There. Still sensitive. You relax now. Syringe. Uh. First rule of medicine. Relieve the patient. Be quick and painless as possible. Thank you. That's it. That's better. Now, just a wait a moment for it to take. Uh-hmm. - See? No pain. - Uh-hmm. It's all localized. With no problem at all. Uh-hmm. I'm ready. You're doing a marvelous job, hotchkiss. It's a good weight. Thank you. Hold his shoulders. Uh, would you excuse me, please. Just a little room. Thank you. - Hold his head. - Yeah. Uh-hmm. Hey. - Well done, doc. You got 'er. - Thank you. Thank you. Hotchkiss, dispose of this and clean up the mess. Thank you. Uh, sir, got your tooth out. Everything's fine now. You can relax. Uh. Okay. It's all right. Uh, uh, we better take him to his bunk. He's a just a little stiff. Thank you. Easy, uh, now turn down the bed. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Thank you, hotchkiss. Fine. Now, let's put him up here. All right, fine. I can take care of everything now. Thank you. - Okay, doc. - Thank you. Doc. Shh. Yes? Look here, we're sailing in half an hour. If I know the captain, he'll want to be on the bridge. - Is he gonna be able to make it? - No, no, no. I wouldn't count on it. He needs a rest. - Well, he's sure getting it. - Yeah. Very well. If it's necessary, I'll assume the responsibility - and take it out myself. - Yes. You assume the responsibility and take it out yourself. Well, well, clean those up. Yes. There's the old man laying on the bunk like he'd never had a full night's sleep in his life. Hey, come in. Come in. You've all met the new doc. - Yes, I do. - No, no. We didn't meet. Emmett. Happy to know you. - How do you do? - Sit down. - Thank you. - Sit down, doc. I stopped by to see the captain. Oh? Well, I don't know what you gave him but he's still out. He's out cold. Well, well, if he's sleeping that hard, he must've needed the rest. - Don't we all? - Hear! Hear! Is something the matter? Oh, no, no, no. It's just that I'm not hungry. Hmm. Well, come on, venders. We've got work to do. Excuse us. Doc, gentleman. Let me know when he wakes up. Right. Hmm. Excuse me. - Sir? - Yes? The first lieutenant wants to see you on the bridge. Well, t'll be right there. Sir, he said immediately. All right. You sent for me, sir? Right. Listen, doc. We got trouble. What kind of trouble? - Good morning, doc! - Good morning. Best tooth-pulling job I've ever had. And a good sleep, sir. That's the best part of it. - Congratulations. - Uh, thank you, sir. Listen, we've had a last minute change of orders. I thought I'd better let you know. - Oh? - We're assigned to Korea and we're heading immediately into an operational area. - Does that mean action, sir? - Oh, yes. Plenty of it. From what I hear, you'll be a very busy man. - Oh. - So, I thought I'd better let you know, so you can get ready. Well, thank you, sir. Nice to have you with us, mornay. Thank you. Proud to be aboard, sir. Right. Sir, the mail boat is coming up alongside. Thank you. So you see, my love. They couldn't keep me from you. This morning I arrived on my new assignment, the naval hospital in Tokyo. One day, the cayuga will steam into Tokyo harbor and I'll be waiting for you on the dock. Till then, keep well, my darling, for... your loving Catherine. Uh, they just put a Korean army liaison man aboard, sir. Captain hun Kim. He's not feeling very well. Well, I think he's got the flu. Uh, well, give him some aspirins. Aspirin. Aspirin and band-aids. Three colds and a burned finger from a hot shell casing and they call this a war? Looks like we're in for some weather, Mr. headley. Yes, sir. All bad. Small boat, aft the port beam. Put this light on them. Let's have those. What do you make of it, captain? Looks like one of our fishing boats. Could be a trap. Boarding party to the quarterdeck. Cover them. Let's go, captain. Boarding party to the quarterdeck. Man the guard rail. Let's go. Commandos, sir. Rok commandos. They want to know if medical help is available. Tell him it's all right to come alongside. Get doc mornay up here. Get him up here right away. Come on. All right, come on. Get to it. Step lively. They were caught in ambush, sir. There was nowhere else for them to turn for medical help. I'll see what the doc has to say. Stone, we'll need a couple of stretchers. Will you men get some stretchers? Shannikan, hawes, you can help out down here. Come on, on the double, you men, let's go. Stone, where is doc mornay? I'll look, sir. Right. He says better not treat the wound than cut the uniform. In winter he will freeze. Hmm. Do you think you can handle all this, Joe? I don't know. Three of those men are in pretty bad shape. Uh, I don't know whether we can help them or not. They're going to need immediate surgery. As far as the rest of these men are concerned, I can clean, suture, and clamp up the bleeding. But that's about it. Uh, can I rig your cabin into an operating room? Yes, of course. Fine, hotchkiss, get those three men ready for surgery. Uh, get the rest of these men down in the sick bay and clean them up and make them as comfortable as possible. Yes, sir. Chief, we'll need some hands with these stretchers. Let's go, huh? Joe, the captain here would like to help out in any way he can. Thank you very much. Listen, there's a wind coming up. I'm afraid, it's gonna be pretty rough. Well, what are we gonna do? Do you want to wait till it blows over? I can't do that, captain. A few of those men won't last a couple of hours - without surgery. - All right. We've got enough sea room to head into it. I'll try to keep it as steady as I can and... Good luck. All right, let's go. Help me, dear god. I don't want to kill anybody. This one's the worst. Whatever hit him is still in there. He's hemorrhaging. Get the tourniquet. Above the elbow. Swab. Sodium pentothal. What is he saying? He's just a peasant boy, doctor. What did he say, captain? He said, "may god guide your hand." Tell him, I just made the same prayer. What's her head now? Zero-zero-five, sir. Let's play it safe. Steer zero-three-five. Steer zero-three-five. Steer zero-three-five, sir. She ought to a steady down on that, provided it doesn't blow up anymore. There it is. A piece of shrapnel, quarter of an inch from the heart. Forceps. Hemorrhage. - Hemostat. - In your hand. Hemostat. Hemostat. It's stopped bleeding. He'll make it. It's really a miracle, isn't it? You don't know how much of a miracle. How're they making out down there? He's on his third operation, sir. He's okay, but it's slow going. I'll bet you right now the doc wishes he never set foot on the cayuga. Well, I can't blame him. How's that? Huh? All right. Let's go down to sick bay. That's it, sir. What's it? That's all 19. You're finished, sir. Good going, doc. Thank you. Congratulations, doc. - Great job, doc. - Doc, congratulations. Thank you very much. - Nice going, doc. - Thank you. Doc, nice going. Thank you. Excuse me. Thanks. Doc, you look like you could stand a drink. - I can. - Come on. It's true. The report just came in. He's a hero. And now the press is on to the story. Nineteen operations in one night. They're calling him the miracle doctor. Remarkable as the operations are, what he has done on chinnampo is even more so. He has taken over a hut and he's given those people a hospital. The first hospital that that island has ever known. In addition to battlefield patients, he's also operating on civilians. Last, last week, he tried something he himself admitted that he has never done before. A lung resection on a 60-year old woman. We were in touch, uh, during the entire procedure. Radioing detailed instructions to him. The operation was a success. Only this morning, gentleman. The naval headquarters tried to bring him in here to be decorated. He wouldn't hear of it. To top it all, it seems possible that he's too modest for his own good. But gentleman, this is... Lieutenant mornay's fiancee. This is lieutenant Catherine Lacey. Lieutenant, where did you meet him? How long have you known him? Uh, Lacey, is that with an "e" or without an "e"? Lieutenant, do you have a photograph of him? Oh, I'm sure that headquarters has a photograph of him there. But doctor, isn't it just possible that you're not the only Dr. Joseph c. Mornay in Canada? Of course, it's possible. That's why I told myself when they broke the story on the radio. Then came the newspapers, and this picture. I know this man. He spent a week here. He said he was on a vacation. We talked and played chess together every night. But he's a fraud, an impostor. And he's no doctor. He's a college professor, psychologist. His name is Robert Boyd Hammond. Hey, George. Take a look at this. Holy. Joe, I'd like to speak to you for a minute. Yeah. What'd she say? Oh, she's my lung resection. She wouldn't leave so I had to make a hurse's aide out of her. Yes, but what did she say? She, uh, she likes to call me the man with the, uh, gentle heart. Joe... This came in about an hour ago. I'd like for you to have a look at it. Now, I want you to know that I don't believe a word of that. I'm sure headquarters has made some dreadful blunder. You just tell me that it's all a mistake and I'll send a message and we can forget the whole thing. If I didn't like you so much, I'd let you do just that, but... I'm afraid that would get you into a lot of trouble. I'm glad I got here before you went it. Now they've no right to do this, Fred. Not without your defense attorney present. They didn't call me. I asked to be here. - What for? - I'm guilty. And I want to get this over with as quickly - and as quietly as possible. - These things have to follow a certain pattern. Now you can't interfere. The board's meeting how to determine the charges against you and set the data of court-martial. Uh, then what? We go to trial, and am I ready for it? Oh, boy. I can see you are. I've worked out a magnificent defense for you. - I have no defense. I'm guilty. - Ah, you're innocent. - I'm guilty. - Innocent. Your record is your defense. The perfect defense. Captain glover's prepared to testify along with the entire crew of the cayuga. Plus the real Ben w. Stone and warden, uh... - Chandler. - Chandler. He says you're the best deputy warden he's ever had. And, uh... - Wonderful. - Father devlin's come forward. - He's on your side, of course. - Uh-hmm. Even Dr. mornay says he will not press charges. He now claims that all you did was help people in his name. And here's the topper. I just got this about an hour ago. Here. A cablegram from lieutenant Catherine Lacey, she'll be here tomorrow. - Oh, no. - Yeah, she's flying in all the way from Tokyo and I understand that you are going to be decorated by the Korean government. - Now that... clinches it. - Now, look. Look. I don't want to be decorated by the Korean government and I don't want Catherine Lacey here. Now, you've got to get me out today. Right now. - That's impossible. - Itis, is it? Have you any idea the embarrassment I have caused this committee? Huh? They've been meeting in there for two days. They're trying to figure out how they can explain how a phony with two years of high school can end up a surgeon lieutenant in the royal Canadian Navy. Look, I am well aware that the situation is delicate. But these things, they just have to follow a normal course. - Lieutenant? - Hmm? I'm going to teach you a simple lesson in logic. - What's that? - You ready? Follow me. Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred. Wait a minute. Look, you can't go in there. Fred. Listen to me, Fred. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to interrupt this way but... Mr. demara, this is most irregular. Your request for a hearing is still under consideration. I know, sir. But if I can only have a moment of your time. I think I have a possible solution to this, uh, situation. Very well, but be brief. The door, please. Thank you, sir. Gentleman, there sometimes exists a real conflict between the letter and the spirit of the law. It is the letter of the law that the guilty should be punished. But it is also the spirit of the law that the innocent should be protected. Unfortunately, some innocent people are involved in this case. Good people whose only fault was that they accepted and believed in me. I've hurt them, one in particular enough. Now a prolonged trial would only cause them and the Navy further embarrassment. Sir, I beg you, drop the case against Fred w. Demara, alias Dr. Joseph c. Mornay, drop it here and now. Let me walk out that door and I promise you, within an hour, I'll be on a train and out of Canada for good. Be seated, gentleman. Stand at attention. Mr. demara, this board finds itself in an extremely difficult position. This case being without precedent, our only guide is consideration for how justice can best be served. It has been ably and I trust in good faith, pointed out, gentleman, that justice, in this instance lies in the spirit of the law. This board, therefore, will act to that end. By the authority delegated to me, as of now, demara, you are released from the service. Good day to you. Excuse me, sir. I would like to add that I'm proud that I served in the royal Canadian Navy. Good day. I can't tell you how upset I am. That was presumptuous of our state police. They might have at least contacted the board of education. We're not going to prosecute. It could be embarrassing. Well, I wish I knew that. I would have brought Fred's father and mother here with me. Father within the last hour, I have received more than 50 telegrams from haven isle. They want Martin Goddard back, whatever his name is. Best teacher they ever had. It was always like that, Mr. Warren. Ah, if Fred could only realize people want him for himself, right? I know why I want him. I'm going to marry him. And I'll take any name that Fred's willing to share with me. The f.B.I. Still hasn't located him. Now, they think he's somewhere in south America. - Sir, I've done every... - If demara starts any of his shenanigans down there, it could lead to serious international complications. I've had all our people on alert ever since he was reported in Mexico, sir. But we need someone to take charge. I think I've finally found the right man, sir. Who?
