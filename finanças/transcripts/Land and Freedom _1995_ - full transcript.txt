Would you like to sit down? Madam, could you please move the chickens? Good. The more that come, the sooner we’ll win. Do you want a drop? Tickets, please. He’s with us, boss. He’s come to fight the fascists. —Hey, dickhead. Make up your mind. —Shut up. I’m in charge here. —I’m pissed off with this. —This is important. Pick it up immediately. —You pick it up. I’m off. —Where are you going, love? Don’t call me “love”. Comrade. I am going to Madrid. Understand? They take things seriously there. This is vital for the revolution, for both men and women. We’ve got to have discipline. We’ll never win without it. Where are we going to get to with this? This is just the beginning. —I want a gun. —You’ll get to fight … … please trust me. Get back in the line. What are you lot gawking at? Let’s have some energy. I’ve seen more life in a sick note. Right! Halt! My name’s Raffaele Poccetti, Captain. Fascist bastards. Rot in hell! Sons of bitches! Fascists—you’ve got no balls. The food here’s fucking brilliant. Hey, rich bastard, you’ll die with nothing. I’m going to shove a bullet up your arse! Murderers … —What’s your name, lad? —José. José. Are you hungry? And where are you going? —I’ve got some questions for you. —I don’t have to answer. I’m a professional soldier. Support the government elected by the people. It’s not a real government. How many soldiers in your command? Have you got machine guns? Artillery? Do your soldiers obey you? Of course. We’re a real army. No. Sorry. Coogan, over here. Pigat? Are you all right? Where are you going? —What’s wrong? —Leave me alone. I want to go home. What’s wrong? —I’m going home, OK? —Why? I’ve got things to sort out. You’re crazy. You can’t just leave like this. I came here willingly and I’ll leave when I feel like it, OK? No, it’s not that easy. You can’t just go when you want to. There’s a discipline here. Listen, my woman’s fucking another man. Who’ll sort it out? You? Vidal? OK. —What are you going to do? —String the son of a bitch up by his balls. And what good would that do? Tell me, what good would that do? Make me feel better. Stay here, with your companions. I came here for her. For my daughter. For the future. You’ve got a daughter? She was two last month. —What’s her name? —Lidia. Look, if we don’t win this war, there’ll be no future for anybody. Right? Not for Lidia, not for your wife, not you, not me, not anyone. Do you understand? This is the pig that was shooting from the tower. Quiet. I’m going to ask one simple question. Have you fired this rifle? —No. —Tell me the truth. Have you fired this rifle? —There’s the proof. —What’s this, then? Kill him! He informed on five comrades from the Union, and they’re dead now. What happened? They took my husband and shaved my head. Why? Because my husband was in the militia. Murderer! And we’ll see you in three days …. Two or three days …. We feel a great sorrow today, but it must not halt our efforts. Our companions have not died in vain. Josefina, Sebastián, Teresa, all of you, we all fight for the same thing as they did. And we shall continue. It’s what they would have wanted. They’re here with us, fighting for the same cause. We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades. And from this place we must draw the strength to fight on. The battle is long, and our foes are many. But we are more. We shall always be many more. Tomorrow is ours, comrades. The struggle goes on. They shall not pass. We shall overcome. Come on, sit down …. Friends. Don Julian’s house is now the house of the people. Let’s start the meeting. Who’s going to speak? —Teresa. —We must collectivise. The men at the front have no food and the people in the village have been left with next to nothing by the fascists. The village hasn’t got enough food. We must collectivise, as soon as possible. We must get food to feed our people and the comrades fighting for us at the front. I’m in agreement with the collectivisation of Don Julian’s lands, or re-distribution in all its forms, but each to his own little bit, no? I work my land my own way. It’s not much, all that I have. I started working it, and …. Shit! I’ve thrown everything into it. —Miguel, what would you like to say? —I’d like to say to our friend here that it’s very good that he wants to work his own land, but how much better it would be if we all worked it together. When the harvest is ready, are you going to eat all the wheat, and all the potatoes? We need everything to be able to keep the revolution going. The revolution has to be done this way. —Don’t wait for tomorrow. —José, it’s not only a question of land. The revolution is like a pregnant cow. If we don’t help out, the cow and its calf will be gone and the children will be left hungry. Remember that comrades, boys, died in this battle. We must collectivise. Do you understand me? The people must eat. This struggle we’ve started has to continue. There are those who are the way they are, and there are those who know how to work and people who don’t …. I’ve got what I’ve got because I work. Hold on. Paco’s turn. It’s fundamental that we improve our harvests. We must grow more. Other villages have done it by working all the land as one. With a tractor you can do five times more work in one day than you can with a mule. There’s evidence from other villages that it’s working. I believe we have to take over private property. No one’s got anything …. We could pool all our resources and depending on each person’s situation we could share it out. If you need a cow, you’ll get one. We’ve all got four or five kids and we’ve all bust a gut working, just like you. We’ve got militia comrades here who may know what’s happening elsewhere. They’ve helped us here. Pepe’s right. Our friends from the militia will have seen what’s happened in other villages. This is an open meeting. You can speak, too. Your opinions are as welcome as any of ours. please speak. I’m from Germany. We wanted revolution, and what happened? We’d been the strongest movement in Europe, the best organised workers’ movement. There were six million of us in unions, and what happened? Hitler. The socialists and the communists told us to make our revolution later. But I say make the revolution now. When people see as the village sees that you can be in charge of your life, your land, when collectivisation becomes a reality, it’ll be possible for people in Germany, Italy, to follow our example. We’re poor but we’re alive and we’ve got power now, we don’t have to be seized by fear. We’re alive, we’ll die when our time comes, but …. I say that we have to take risks. What do we do? Misery, hunger, hopelessness. Franco might come back and kill us, but I say it’s worth it to continue collectivising and improving the quality of our lives. Let’s vote. All those in favour of collectivisation. All those against. Friends, the vote is to collectivise the land. Pigat, Garibaldi, Roca. Listen …. Max. Come here …. Excuse me a moment, please. This is probably the last time that we can vote on something as a militia. All right? Now watch. Put the bullet in here. You take off the catch, and it’s ready for firing. You need to hold the rifle harder against your shoulder. Fire. How’s your shoulder? You’re afraid of the rifle. Hold it firmly, like this. You mustn’t jerk the trigger. Squeeze it like a woman’s tits. Understand? —Have you ever squeezed a woman’s tits? —Yeah. —I’ll bet you have. —Hold on a minute. Come quickly. Get a stick. A stick! —Is this boarding house around here? —The pension Adela? Hello. Do you have a room for me? Who are you? My friend Blanca sent me …. I like having English people, they are clean and tidy. —This is my room? —This is yours. The attack of the telephone exchange is a declaration of war against the working class …. —What are the POUM up to? —A general strike has been called in all industries. except those producing weapons …. Plants, warehouses are stopping work. The barricades of liberty have risen again in every part of town. You should be killing fascists, not one another! Shut up and go home. Get out of here, madam. You’ll get hurt. We’ve got nothing to eat. D’you hear? We’ve got to put food on the table. Sorry, friend. I’m sorry. Hey, you, Stalin’s sidekick. What division were you in? The Karl Marx division. And you? The Third Division? No, you bastard. We’re from the Durruti Column, the best. You don’t even know who’s your enemy. You idiots! You have betrayed the revolution. That’s a lie. You’re the ones who have broken the anti-fascist front. We can smell food, fascists. —What are you cooking, bastards? —Sausages and beans. Are you hungry? You bet! Then here you are. No more. Never. We’re not enemies. My friend, Martin, returned from the front dying of hunger. It’s a disaster. —Which front? —Aragon. The militias are a disaster. When it’s decision time, everyone is the boss. They say they don’t even know how to load the guns. They say the militia women aren’t killing fascists, they are fucking them instead. —They fuck them. —They do nothing. They’re crap. They’re a disaster. They take four totally inexperienced men, —give them guns and stars …. —That’s a lie. I’m from the front. You’re in the militia? He can’t even speak properly. —What’s going on? —That’s enough! Are you mad, or what? What do you think is going on? If the leaders of the POUM and CNT get together, we’re fucked. That’s what’s happening! They need to come from abroad to tell us that? So what? At least it’s good that they’re here. They’re bombing us …. Listen …. Where’s the cover you promised? What kind of position is this? Nobody’s come. You don’t understand anything …. We can’t hold on …. We’re fucked here …. You’ve got to hold on. This is madness. Yes, sir. Retreat immediately. Why are you giving me this order when you’ve just told me to hold the position? All right? I also want to know …. Listen! Why we’ve been risking our lives here, waiting for the promised reinforcements. All right? Whatever you say, sir. Madruga, Andrès, come here …. And the rest, quickly. Garibaldi, Roca, we’re going back to our old positions …. Come on, Roca. Bernard, to the left with Jimmy. David, cover this flank …. Come on. Quickly …. Orderly, orderly, go with them. Come on, David. All of you get back …. Come on, back. —Blanca, come here …. —Orderly, orderly, there’s a bad one. Stay with them. Be brave. —Gene. —Gene, what are you doing here? Take it easy. Stay where you are! —Quiet, everybody. —What the hell’s going on? Drop your weapons on the ground, immediately. Obey the order! What’s the meaning of this? —Can we know why? —Officer, get your men to obey. —I refuse. —Obey my orders! From now on this unit is disbanded. You can all go home, except for the following, who are under arrest. Quiet! Juan Vidal. Bernard Goujon. Miguel Angel Campos. Rafael Jimènez. What are we accused of? The POUM is now illegal. Your newspaper has been banned and your leaders arrested. —What charges? —Conspiring with the fascists. Collaborating with Franco! Is this conspiracy? Is this conspiracy, Colonel? It’s a lie. It’s a lie. Don’t look at the ground, look at me face to face. It’s not a reflection on you, it’s your leaders. It’s a Stalinist plot. Siètamo. What about SiÈtamo? Alcubierre? Leciñena? Casetas de Quisena? Tierz? Navales? They’re all places liberated by the POUM. —Were they fascists who did that? —I don’t have to discuss this with you. Estrecho Quinto? La Naja? Les Drassanes? Were these places liberated by fascists, too? Quiet! Obey my order! Prepare to fire! Take it easy! —Madruga, quiet! —You’re under arrest. Do as he says. What happened in Barcelona with our comrades? Murderers! They’re going to shoot you …. Murderers! Control your men, Captain. Fight with us against fascism. You bastard, come here, you coward. Silence, you idiots. God Almighty. Murderers! You bastards …. We’ve fought for nothing, comrades. —Lower your guns. —Death to Stalinism! Long live the revolution. Down with fascism. We shall leave them in the ground. but the earth is ours now. comrades. and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on. The battle is long, and our foes are many. but we are more. We shall always be many more. Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
