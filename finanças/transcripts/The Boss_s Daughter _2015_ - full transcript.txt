A bit more to the right, gentlemen. - Nice one. - Don't move. Push a bit more, the forwards. Thanks. Gently. Come on. Push a bit, number six. - Number nine, lift your head. - Yeah, do it. Now, pivot a bit to your right. That's great. Well done. - I'm going to fall. - I'm pivoting. That's great. Pull each other's shirts now. Keep on moving, I'm not done yet. - That's it. It's a winner. Beautiful. - Wonderful. The sun's out, I'll take another one. Come and eat, Joseph. - Are you coming Saturday? - Yes. Can I play ten? - We'll see. - Bring him back in one piece. - It's Francoise's wedding. - He can manage, he's a big boy. - This shit is super strong. - Double-sided brushed fabric. Thermo... - Tear-proof. - Stop it, you're going to rip it. It's tear-proof. Look, Craquotte can't rip it. Chill out, we're not clients. - The logo is rubbish. - Shut up, my girlfriend drew that. Do you like it? Now we have two kits of shirts, training gear and he pays for the coach. You think the shirts will help us win? - Who knows? - They helped you keep your job. - No way. - Yes. - You're coming Saturday? - I said I would. - You'll be here Saturday? - Yes, but why does he get to be ten? At least we're good for two months. And thanks to who? "Turn this way, now that way." Does he think we're models? Are we men, or what? That's what happens when you get sponsorship. Anyway, I'm not doing this every week. Shame it's not for a nude calendar. Nude! With an arse like yours? My arse belongs to me, all right? Leave it out of it. Don't forget we almost got relocated to Turkey. - Not Turkey, Tunisia, fool! - Same thing. I'm watching the sausages while your kids are frolicking. Why are you bringing my kids into it? - What's your problem? - How's the olive cake? Are they my kids, or yours? You don't even know. - Very nice. - It's nice, but I can't eat bacon. Come and eat, Joseph. Frano, leave some for the kids. - I'll turn you into a merguez. - Go get the others. It usually takes 45 minutes, but her peasant's hands took me an hour. My wife doesn't have peasant's hands, I do. - She has fairy's hands. - It would take a week to do yours. Let's talk about your bikini line. Why don't you go over there and stay there? Two of you is enough. - Are you at least coming Saturday? - I'm not sure. - Knitters! - Brave! Hey, there's food here. - Not in the food! - Well done, guys. - They're playing ball. - Play somewhere else, for God's sake. The kids are hungry, they should eat. I'd like some sausages. Thanks. - I don't like it. - You don't like mustard? Okay, they don't give me much. - Don't drink too much, Frano. - Finish it. THE BOSS'S DAUGHTER Shut up, Kiki. Stupid sparrow. It's me. You reek of beer. Hands off. Let's go, sweetie. - Are you swimming today? - It's Monday, Daddy. - I got a ten. - Out of? - Ten. - In what? - Reading. - You're raising the family's bar! Start her up. - See you tonight. - See you tonight. SEMI-FINAL FRENCH CORPORATE RUGBY LEAGUE BUSINESSMAN BANKS ON RUGBY - My husband is cut in half. - Where are all the photos? Blah, blah. - They don't even mention the match. - I told you. - But we're a good team. - Here, this tiny section. - Even though we made the semi-final. - Quiet, please. Everyone, quiet now. Mr Baretti will explain everything in detail. - Baretti is coming. - Ergonomics... Hello, everyone. I need a few minutes of your time. First, I'd like to congratulate the team, which will represent us at the semi-finals on Saturday. Well done, gentlemen. You're doing us proud. Well done. Next, we have now signed the Quality Pact. As you already know, we'll start today with an ergonomics study. This study will lead to adjustments to make you happier in your workplace. I believe happy employees are more productive. That's what it's all about. We read the article already. So you know it all? It's my pleasure to welcome to our firm a highly qualified ergonomist. I would ask you to play ball and be cooperative. That's enough of me. Let's hear from the expert. Hello, my name is Alix Malherbe and I'll be with you for a little while. So, what are ergonomics? Does it hurt? Ergonomics is about adapting work to people's different characteristics. I'm here to carry out a study on psychosocial risks at work. Your superiors will then be advised on how to improve your work conditions. You might think some of my questions sound stupid. I will use devices you might find barbaric. - I still don't get it. - I will work with two novice-experts. So I will need two of you to contribute a bit more. - I bet it's going to be me. - Great start. - Now you know everything. Back to work. - Thank you. - Steph, your suit is too big! - Stop it. Everyone back to work. - Are you settling in okay? - Very well. - The knitting section is through there. - Okay. Excuse me. Yes? Yeah. Okay. I'm on my way. Vital, come here. Alix, this is Vital, our team leader. - Nice to meet you. - Same here. Can you show her around? We will catch up later. No problem. - What would you like to see? - Everything. It's the untwisting machine. Watch your step. I'll need user manuals and security guidelines. You'll need to ask upstairs. Stocks and finished product. Hello. I'm in charge of this machine. I pass the fabric through and... I control the quality. Actually I can see a flaw. I need to report it. Here, look. I'm done, Lolo, you can switch it on. - Hello. - Hello. Is it working? What does this big machine do? This is Duchess, our parent machine, it powers all the rest. - The whole production line relies on it? - Yeah. All right. Thank you. - I'm Marc. - Alix. Nice to meet you. - Welcome. - Thanks. Room temperature and cold. You press here. - Thank you. - Any time. - Everything okay? - Yes. If you need anything, just ask. Actually I'll need user manuals, memos, regulations and security guidelines. - I'll get them. - Thank you. Come and see me later. I'll debrief you. - You can't be the expert. - Why not? Give it up. She's bound to go for the pretty boy. She's a classy girl, she wouldn't pick a slob like you. She'd prefer the old git? - First, I'm not old. - But you are a git. Come on now. I have a bad feeling about her. - You're late. - Some of us have to work. - How was the debriefing? - Did you show her your olive cake? - HR, who did she choose? - It's not for me to say. - Come on! - No. Ten press-ups if you drop it. Come on, faster. Wake up, President. Thanks, Filou. Come on. - There. Good. - Come on. Come on, guys. - Come on. - Push through. Everyone in place. There's no money coming in, I can't even buy thread. We'll see how it goes. I can't move a muscle with Brussels' directives. I have no choice. What? Okay, let's do that. All right. Thanks for calling. Yeah, me too. Say hello to your wife. "Hyperextension is an over-stretching of the tendons." - Who is it? - The results are anonymous, Dad. - I'll give you my report when I'm done. - Fine, don't get upset. - This matters to me. - I know, I'm sorry. How was your day? Did you pick your two guys? I don't want to talk about work every night. You should rest, or you'll raise your blood pressure. You're right. - Coming to the match on Saturday? - No, I'd rather go home on the weekend. I heard they're doing a study at the factory. It's the boss's latest fad. You're not worried? Not particularly. Still, it's strange. Everyone is talking about it. - You never tell me anything. - Everyone does as they please. There's some chicken in the oven. What are they doing? - Do I really need to take it off? - It's better if you do. Thank you. Please step on the scale. Why? Are you a doctor? Almost. I study bodies at work, and your weight is a significant factor. - 85... - Sorry? 83. Thank you. Lie down on the table, please. - Can I put my trousers on? - Yes. Lie down, please. I'm going to take your pulse. Relax. - Do you smoke? - I gave up. A long time ago? Yeah. Thank you. We'll start with a heart rate activity analysis. Put the watch on. It's connected to the heart rate monitor. We'll record the effect your workload has on your heart. - With that stuff? - It records your peak heart rate. A peak heart rate may indicate physical discomfort or psychological stress. It can lead to burnout. There. Right in the middle. Your heart rate should appear. - It's not working. - We have to wait. That's it. - Is that okay? - It's your pulse. 91 beats per minute. Relax! - 80. - 80. We're done, breathe. You're ready. Put your clothes back on. - What are you doing? - Working, boss. Top form, guys! - What did you get? - 72. - See that? - Yeah, gutted. I wanted to do it. I even had a shower just in case. What can I say? Survival of the fittest. - We can't deliver before September. - Why not? An eight-colour jacquard takes longer. Then why did she give us this? It's how we got the market. Plain is out of fashion, sir. What happens if we lose a month? - It will be tough. - You need to replace him. We need enough thread in order to do it. I can't work on... Virginie, please bring the forecast report. Find a way to make it before September. - Of course. - That would be great. Please. Get rid of those. I don't want any trouble with the labour inspector. Thank you. Excuse me. - You're in my way. - Sorry. What are you recording? What about you? It's confidential. Same here. Do you ever worry about this machine? I bet your report ends up concluding that work is tiring. - Are you sure? - Malherbe is her mother's name. Her real name is Alix Baretti. And Baretti isn't a common name. It's not even French. - So what? She's his daughter. - Quequette, you're doing supply today. - Fuck. I told you, Big Capital is watching us. - God knows what they're doing. - You knew, didn't you? - Why didn't you say? - I couldn't. Sorry. I know what they are doing. They'll take him as a standard measure and we'll be screwed. You don't think it's because of his looks? You wait, in a month they'll say we're off sick too often, and we work too slowly. How much is she getting paid? I'll show her how the machinery works. Problem solved. - Leave me some. - Avenge us. - World champion. - I'm sure you'll be great. - Why didn't you tell me? - Tell you what? That you're Baretti's daughter. Why? It wasn't necessary. Your questions aren't necessary either. It's not about me. What difference does it make? What are you playing at? Are you spying on us so you can fire someone? Not at all. We don't want to fire anyone. Especially not my dad. He started from the bottom 30 years ago, just like you. I'm here to observe your postures so you don't get any work-related diseases. Musculoskeletal disorders. Why me? HR recommended you. You've been here 21 years and you're a team manager. You're the most qualified worker. Exactly my point. For example, you have a lingering pain in your left arm, sensitivity loss in your hand, pains that wake you up. It's a cervicobrachial Neuralgia. You sprained your neck recently. See. You'd trust me if I wasn't Baretti's daughter. I'd be a pro. But my intentions have to be bad, right? If you want to stop, no problem. I'll pick someone else. It's okay. What's okay? Let's carry on. Vital, 83 jersey, 109 jacquard. We'll throw it away afterwards. It's late. Brush your teeth. I'll wash your hair tomorrow. She has lice. Go on. Did you learn your poem? - Baretti used to be a labourer. - Really? So what? Let me do it. Thanks. Are you happy with me? Why are you asking this? Please, tell me. What a stupid question. And you already know the answer. Then what are we doing? What do you mean? We're married, we go to work, we raise our kid. That's what we're doing. We don't even fuck any more. That's because I won't fuck unless you're nice. And you can't be nice, unless you fuck. How many times a day do you do this gesture? 300, maybe 400. 697. So using the correct posture is vital to prevent injury. Here, you're way too... Do you want anything special for dinner? Hi, Marc. - Excuse me. - I was thinking guinea fowl. They think I'm only here thanks to nepotism. You're competent and useful, that's why you're here. - So treat me like a colleague. - No problem, sweetie. - What do you want for dinner? - Not now, I'm working. - I'm really sorry. - No worries. I don't care if your dad's the boss, as long as you do your job well. Thank you. If you could give me a good mark... I'd appreciate it. So your husband is the star of the factory. - Steph won't shut up about it. - I wish it was my man. I'm not sure what's the point of it all. Apparently she puts devices on him and follows him around. - Scientific stuff. - I'm glad I left. You should watch out. He might turn into a mutant. What an idiot! It's made him open up, that's for sure. We even talked yesterday. - It's true. - About what? - I'll tell you later. - See, it's great. Be positive. - Come watch the match with us. - Yeah, come on, Mado. - No way, I've done my share. - Haven't we all? I can't stand it any more. Stop it. It's not for fun, they're in the semi-finals. - See you tomorrow. Bye. - How are you? - Fine, and you? See you Monday, ergonomist lady. Tomorrow. I'm going to the match. That's nice. See you tomorrow then. Really, you're going to a match? You should have said. Now I have to cancel at the last minute. I'm sorry, Marie, but I really have to go. We have an appointment with a guy from the French Institute in Montreal who can find us a great flat and you ditch me for a football match. Rugby. It's important for the study to see how workers behave outside of work. Yeah, I bet. Your growth estimate came through. It should be okay. I hope so. - If you want to sell... - I told you, not now. When we win the finals, the shares will go up. You should sell now. I have a serious contender for you. Arsenal! Knitters! Oh my. Is there an intermission? You didn't have to come, Marie. We're in it to win it - How are you, Dad? - I'm so glad you came. - And Marie, too. What an honour! - How are you, Fred? - Do you know my two escort girls? - "Pom pom", dad. In it to win it In it to win it - Go Arsenal! - Go Knitters! That puta made me take my nails off. How dare she! The least an ergonomist could do is respect people's work. - Which one is she? - They were too long, anyway. Not you too. I do them shorter as well, you know. You pick the size. The blonde or the red head? - La puta. - The blonde. Here they are. Arsenal! Knitters! A Neanderthal. I'm surprised. I thought it was the cute one over there. I guess you're looking for an alpha male genitor. What are you on about? You know, body odour is a good way to choose a partner. It's to do with pheromones. On the left! It's okay, I have it. Got it. Faster! Push! Wake up, for God's sake! There's no defence, no tackling. Wake up, Lolo! - Tackle them right away, all right? - Careful when there's a lot of them. THEM / US Eddy, are you fucking kidding me? I've got it. Where's the fucking support? - Relax. - Nothing to worry about. - Come on, big guys. - We do as planned. Take your positions. Ready. Go. Come on! Shit, they're big. - Shut up and play. - Yeah, so what? - Go, go! - Fuck! Come on, guys. Give your all for Biscotte. The ball is ours. We're getting thrashed. Support should come right away. Wipeout. Got it, Lolo? - I'm knackered. - I don't give a shit. Get moving. We're 40 minutes away from the final. We want the title. - So let's get moving. - No way we're getting a beating. Not in front of our families and not in our new kit. - So we fight. We go for the title. - I can't see you from the front, guys. Steph doesn't have a clean ball so you support him. Or we'll lose. - Okay, we're on it. We're here. - Come on! Eddy, you dropped four balls. It's way too many. So focus. - Lepetit, you're out. - Shit. Marc, you're ten now. Beram, outside centre. - No problem. - Yeah, mate. They'll try to work you up and spoil the game. Stay calm, play the game. We are fast, skilled, talented. Just play and we'll make it. Simple. Okay? - Knitters! - Brave! Come on! - Come on! - Come on! Thank you. Come on, back in place. We still need two. Come on, Marc. You kick it over, OK? Yes, yes... Yeah, come on! Come on! Come here! I told you they'd beat them. They didn't let go. Knitters! Knitters, we are the Knitters Knitters, what is your job? - Knitters! - We're here! Enough now, you're drunk. My mum let me stay out until three To get wasted at the Pitchoulie The Pitchoulie, the meeting place of all the Basques in the country I supported the Quality Pact even before I knew the ergonomist was you. I have no doubt. - I can't drop the kids off tomorrow. - I don't care, it's my weekend. Franio! What are you having? A beer. Two fresh ones. We're in the finals Do you always yell at them? No, I knew we would win so I was nice. You're an optimist. It's my best flaw. We're in the finals We are, we are in the finals To us. Yes. To our collaboration. Stop it! - You're soaking wet. - Hey, play some music. - Where were we? - Here. Let's dance. Stop it! Come join us. - Sofiane told me a really good joke... - Look at Vital. - What's up with him? - He's drunk. Don't be like that. Let me have fun, we're in the finals. Why are you doing this? - Shall we go with them? - Yeah. - We're going to the Vegas. - No, not the Vegas! - Drive safe. - Of course. - Not too drunk? - I'm great! Gladys. - See you tomorrow. - Stop it. - They're peeing on my car. - That means you're the chosen one. Don't get your knickers in a twist. We can't, tomorrow, and that's the end of it. Couldn't you make an effort, as a friend? Do me a favour. Who said we were friends? That is very hurtful. I thought better of you. Calm down, you guys. You're fucking the mum of my kids. - Hey! - All right, enough. - Don't! - Stop it, Frano. The white knight Fucks day and night Let's go. I can take four people. - Coming with me, Eddy? - No thanks, I value my life. - Can you drive? - Don't worry, if we fall, we won't fall fast. It's Saturday, and if we want a baby we have to get busy. Very classy! Can someone take care of him? I'm not coming with you. I want to go home. - I don't feel like partying. - Can you take me? We're going to run you over, you dummy. Pathetic. - Can I ride with you, Vital? - I'm taking her. - Come with me, Frano. - It's better. All right, mate? What are you doing? - I don't have a condom. - I do. I can't connect to the Wi-Fi, I can't download it. Bye. Do you have Wi-Fi? I have a meeting at 7am. I don't understand, it was working fine earlier. - Life is full of mysteries. - That's for sure. Have fun. Did you move Kiki? Why? He's annoying. My radishes have grown a lot. But still no carrots. Radishes grow fast. There. There! I really needed that. Mado. - Get lost! - Open up. Open the door. Open the fucking door, we're going to wake her up. Open up. Don't talk to me. You put your tongue inside her mouth. I had good reasons, Mado. Open the door. Open up. How could you? How could you? Think about the conversation we had. Think about it. Work hard, sweetie. - Hello, Miss. - Hi, Fanny. Hi. You didn't fancy her friend? At least her dad doesn't know us. This is going to get nasty. - Hi. - Guys. - Hi, President. - How are you, Azoug? - All right, mate? - Okay. How are you? - How are you? - Good. Hey, Vital. Was she any good? I'm only joking. - All right, Azoug? - Not bad. How is Mado? Come in. Hello. Hello. Have a seat. Today I'd like us to fill in an evaluation form to determine your level of stress. You mean now? Do you feel you have an excessive workload? Never? Rarely? Sometimes? Often? Nothing happened, okay? Yes, it's for the best. We shouldn't have done it. Exactly. Plus it's a breach of my professional ethics. We can't. It's for the best. Absolutely. You should probably fill it out yourself. Okay. Which machine are we on? The B57, but they're all taken. Let me know. He's a strange guy. Who? Your guinea pig. How was the party? Did they behave? You know what they're like. I know what after-match parties are like. They're not always classy. Actually they were lovely. Lovely... Lovely, how? - Sucking up or lovely...? - Decent and respectful. You understand? There is no coming back. We're over, you said so yourself. You'll regret this. Sorry. - Small or large? - Small. - Sugar? - No. It's easy for some and harder for others. You just need to be patient. Come on, five IVFs in three years. We only fuck through test tubes now. Can you imagine? - Hi. - All right? What does the doctor say? "You have to be patient. Conceiving takes time." Blah blah. Doctors' bullshit. - Try wearing your rugby kit. - Dickhead! Okay. - Hi, guys. - New schedule. - What are you doing here? - I left Mado. Hi, guys. How's it going? Mado kicked him out. You had it coming. Your wife can't keep her trap shut. - She didn't say anything. - She talks too much. She's not the cheater. - What happens between us stays with us. - Right. We won't cope otherwise. You can talk. It's a problem if you can't control your women. Control yours first. - I control my wife, okay? - Calm down. - What do you mean? I control her. - Come on, stop it. - I control my wife plenty. - Lighten up, guys. Take a shit. Have you seen the time? - You're timing seconds? - That's twice, now. - Tomorrow will be the third. - It's the morning, respect that. - I respect the morning. - Keep your stories to yourselves. - Did you have a coffee? - I keep mine to myself. Don't ask me things, then. - How do you know? - I swear. In the changing room. I knew Mado would dump him. Who cares if Mado dumped him, or he dumped her? They aren't together any more. Izir, put the ball away. Hurry up! Need a hand? I'm fine. Stop it! Stop it. Don't play with that stick, you'll blind yourself. I said, stop it. - Don't you have any homework? - No. Go get your workbook. - Look after your brother. - No, go get your workbook. - I want to see it. - Go look after your brother. Now! - I want to see her homework first. - No. - I'd better go. - Don't worry, she'll calm down. No, she won't. Let's go outside. It's bad for your lungs. - That's why you can't run. - No, it's because of the pollution. What did I say? Go to your room! Okay, she's a pretty girl, but I don't get what you're doing. I need some fresh air. We all go through that. Now I can breathe, I don't want to go back. Azoug! Azoug! Wait, I'll be back. Yes? Be quiet! - What? - You bring him here? You're the one who... You bring him here because you're just like him. - I'm not. - Yes, you are. - I saw you. Get lost! - It's not true. - Fine, I'm going. - Get out. Pig! Don't worry, I'm handling it. - I'll leave you to it. - Stay. Get lost. Thanks. See you tomorrow. Vital. What's going on? You left your wife? Yes. Let's talk later. - We need to replace it. - Hello, sir. Hello, Montaut. - And we'll take care of... - Yes, Lepetit. Thank you. Don't worry about Panofi, I'll do what needs to be done. Guys, we're falling behind. If we miss the deadline we'll lose Panofi. - So? - You should have said. It's not our fault you made stupid commitments. - And you're the brains? - It's done now. Either you work your arses off to meet the deadline or we put ourselves at risk. Don't kid yourselves, guys. The company has only 15 days leeway. What do you mean by working our arses off? It means working overtime. Paid? Paid or not? - Time off in lieu. - I don't do unpaid overtime. - We have no choice. - Of course not. Easy for you to say. Yeah, ask your new dad to work his arse off. It's hard for everyone. But it's in our best interests. - You and your stupid orders. - Without them you'd be unemployed. - Calm down, guys. - We're just talking. About working overtime, unpaid. - If you hadn't gone with that bitch... - What did you say? Vital, don't. Stop it, for fuck's sake. That's all you have to say? Enough now, stop it. - You, too. - Enough! - That's enough. - Stop it! - What's wrong with you? - We're a team, for fuck's sake. Some team. Don't count on me for the final. I'm out of here. You never touch the ball anyway. - Don't play, we're not forcing you. - You stupid turnip. That's just how it is, Azoug. - Don't start. - Yeah. - No more trouble, you hear me? - Seriously? - We have enough problems as it is. - Shut up. - He throws punches and he says that? - Leave it. Same with you. No more trouble. Understood? Vital, is that clear? I'm glad you came. I'm glad I found you. - I'm a good cook, aren't I? - I'm overcome. No pun intended. Our skin is so different. I'm so white compared to you. It's your aristocratic side. Yeah, right. I forgot my parasol. You're more the natural type. Yeah. You could say that. Hello. How are you? You were out all night. I'm 26, Dad. Did he drop you off? Yes. What are you playing at? I'm not playing. Is that a problem? How is your report going? I'm working on it. It will be good. You're taking the piss. You think it's funny? No, not at all. We have to go or I'll be late. You go, I'll take my bike. The perfect little labourer. You arsehole. - I didn't think you would go that far. - For crying out loud, Alix. You have a degree and all your life ahead of you. You have a great job offer in Canada. You can't date a guy like him. What do you mean "a guy like him"? A labourer? - Is that what bothers you? - What's in it for him? Do you really think he's interested in you? I know those guys. You think he is in love with you? Perfectly. I do. I think it's possible. You married a solicitor's daughter. Exactly! They have to talk. - It's not Lolo's fault. - No but... What's written here? What is written here? "Baretti." Why? Because I'm Baretti. It's my name on the line. Steph, you fucked up, now you fix this. - It's getting ugly. I'm going. - No more excuses. You find a way to fix this. Now! I'm listening. - I can't hear you. - We can't go any faster. - I can't do eight colours that quickly. - How fast is it going? - 14. - How fast can it go? They set it to 20 at the SNEC, but we've never tried. You set it to 20 then! It's simple, I'm only asking you to change the fucking setting. The machine is fragile, it can't go any faster. - Like I said. - Set it to 20 rounds per minute. The right setting is 14, not 20! They're setting it to 20 at the SNEC and their productivity is 12% higher. That's because they have a newer machine. - He's right, it won't cope. - You're teaching me how to do my job? - No, but I manage this team. - And I manage this production unit. So shut up and do as you're told. If I ask you to set it to 20, you set it to 20. We're dead if we don't speed up. Do you get it? Then you'll sign a disclaimer. - Excuse me? - Want to set it to 20? Write it down. You're all arseholes. Set the machine to 20 rounds per minute. Back to work. And do as you're told. Shame, it's going to break. Montaut, you need to understand something. They picked me to manage all this, not you. So do as you're told, show some respect and stop making a fuss. What the fuck are you doing here? Back to work. - You've made an enemy. - Fuck him. - Set it to 20. - It won't last 24 hours. What can we do? Let's go. You scared me. Each time we sleep together you disappear. What do you want from me? We only met two weeks ago. So... four kids, to get extra child benefit. - An MPV, a beach house... - I'm serious, Vital. I don't know what I want from you. I don't want anything. You told me to relax, so I have. Take me home. - To your dad's? - No, not there. To my place. Come on. There are over 50 temples in Ghorepani. The Newars. Newars. You hear that word everywhere. Have you been to Nepal? You haven't? You should. It's a great place. Over there you just want to scream. You feel so good over there. Of course, you freak out a bit at first. You freak out later too. Look, I didn't show you this one. It's my hotel in Ghorepani. Those roads were a nightmare. There was no hot water or anything. But it's in the Himalayas and... Leave him alone. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you bored? - No. - You're not dancing? - I am. I heard you found a great flat in Montreal. I'll be in New York. We can meet, it's only an hour away. No way. - Yeah, why not. - I'm totally in. - When are you leaving? - In two weeks. That's the plan anyway. You're not sure? You don't turn down a job at McPherson's. - A one-year contract, can you imagine? - Nice! Who's that? Who cares? Vital, what are you doing? Where are you going? I'm leaving. You're leaving without saying goodbye? You're leaving in two weeks. So I'm going before it's too hard. You're right. I'd be really sad too. Aren't you going? Why didn't you tell me? Are you angry? What for? If the Stade francais offered me a trainer's job I'd go for it. Even a kid's post. So go for it. You could come with me. To Canada? Yeah. - Yeah, but... - But what? My attendant isn't here. I don't have the stuff. DIVORCE PETITION - Thanks for the letter. - You're welcome. You're the one who left. Freedom comes at a price. Don't worry, I accept instalments. Please don't start. - Let's go to my room. - I'm coming. You don't look well. Young people are exhausting, right? "Excellent work. Shows a solid grasp of numeracy and counting." Your teacher's handwriting is terrible. "Good participation, shows interest." Very good. "Behaviour: 19/20." That's great. Well done, sweetie. You're a star. - I have to go, I have a meeting. - With your mistress? - She's not my mistress. - But Mum is your wife. - Not any more. - You're not divorced. True, but still... Things will never be the same. I won't live here any more. But I'll always be there for you. You know that? Right? If you need anything, just ask. Our machines are running at full tilt. We need 36,000 metres by tomorrow or we're dead. - Okay, but... - Hello. Hello. Here's my report. Please. We're listening. The EU changed the phonic standards last year. So there are a few changes to be made. On a thermic level too. I assume your conclusions are objective. - Absolutely. - Fine. Thank you, Alix. I will read it thoroughly. Not now? I will read it thoroughly. Thank you. What's that? I don't know. Joseph, red plate. Are you okay? Yes. There's been an accident at the Baretti factory. What happened? You had it set to 20, that's what. They do it at the SNEC. They have a different machine. You do some research before risking people's lives. He's not dead, is he? Take him to the nurse. - Call the ambulance. - I did, sir. Need a hand? - Lolo, let me help you. - Leave me alone. What a mess. What? What? I'm sick of this. The way you look at me. I'm sick of it, enough is enough. You act as if I'm exploiting you when I've been fighting for your jobs for years. But it's never good enough, is it? You're pissing me off. I'm done. I'm selling, okay? You'll deal with Dreyer. Good luck with that. Good luck, gentlemen. - Jacques, wait. - I don't believe it. - You should go too. - Go with your boss. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? - Jacques. - Mr Baretti. - Why are you doing this? - Enough! Give it to me. Why are you doing this? - Mr Baretti. - Jacques, let's talk about this. Eddy, I need a hand. The thread gave in. We need to change the whole system. We have 34 machines working round the clock, which produce 3,000 to 4,000 metres a day. - So that's the knitting section. - Hello. Mr Durieu will take over from me. Thank you. Here is Quality Control. Hello, gentlemen. Then we have the stocks. Please follow me. They'll fire you anyway. If I'm lucky. I don't know how much I'll get. Don't wait for me, okay? I'll come as soon as I can. - You won't come. - I will. No. I will. Eddy, you just talk to him. - I'll do it, I don't give a shit. - You do it. You're all scared. - Azoug, you talk to him. - Marc, you do it. - It's nothing to do with me. - I don't care, I'm telling him. - Hi, Vital. How are you? - Hi. - We have something to tell you. - You're going to receive a letter. - Yeah. - Don't be upset. It's not us. Our wives messed up, they wrote some things. Mado didn't ask for anything. What letter? Testimonies, for the divorce. Desertion. Adultery. - Cool, that's nice. - Tell me about it. You see, Vital. They let their wives do anything. - Mine didn't do it. - My mother neither. Of course, your wife can't write. Eddy, I'm not in the mood. - You're not nice. - Hello. I'm going to the shop. - Bye. - Bye. See you later. - Coffee, guys? - A beer, more like. - My head's about to explode. - I can't drink, I'm on antibiotics. - I'm not a doctor. - Fuck the doc, give me a beer. - We're too many. - He's settled in nicely. Still, he's in deep shit. - All the same... - Yeah. He shouldn't have set it to 20. - Let him be, it's not just that. - Of course not. We're more expensive than the Turks or the Chinese. - How can we compete? - But we do quality. It doesn't change anything. We're fucked. When you want to kill your dog, you say he's got rabies. - Tell us, will they keep us on? - I hope so, or we're dead. Let's not be negative. The company is strong. Baretti is selling, we'll just have a new boss. - That's it. Same as before. - That's true. - I liked Baretti. - Me too. He tricked us with his study. He wanted to sell. She would have told me. That's why he's liquidating. No, he's selling. Can't you tell the difference? There might not be any redundancies. It's not in their interests to restructure the company. So let's go on strike. On strike? We're not even working, you muppet. They told us yesterday to take time off in lieu. We haven't been laid off. We're flexible, that's for sure. - Right suckers. - Elastics. Just so you know, you are entitled to retraining. - Rubbish. - It's a solution you don't agree to. You'll block the factory. And then what? You know what? Screw them all with their final. - What are you doing? - Screw Baretti, but we have to win it. - Yeah. - Fuck him, I'm not defending his shirt. - Have you lost it? - No, I haven't. - I'm not playing with that shirt. - Yeah, let's boycott the final. It's stupid, guys. I want to play. I'm going to play. Are you all stupid or what? This is our final, not his. Sorry, Azoug. It's just a match. - What? It took us months to get here. - Give me that. - We fought hard for it, and this is it. - Exactly. - This fucking final belongs to us. - They're right. Why don't you change the shirts? - The final too. - Yeah, it's for us, and only us. That's what makes us strong. We only have one match left. It's our match, guys. Come on, Vital. Shirt strike. What the fuck are you doing? - Fuck. - There you go. There. Feels good. No, it looks like the Bayonne Rowing Club. - Really? - How about that? - No, it's disgusting. - Guys, we don't have all night. You're right. Look, let's take this one. It's plain and low-key. - True, and the message is clear. - I like it. Come on. It's cool. How many do we need? - We take all of them. - Yeah, all of them. Come on, let's go. Here. Come on, hurry up. - Close the fucking door. - Come on. Strikes are pointless anyway, so it's not a bad idea. It's quite good, even. Hey, imagine the look on Baretti's face when he sees all this. FINAL FRENCH CORPORATE RUGBY LEAGUE Closer! Pass the ball. - Do you want a biscuit? - I don't like biscuits. Me neither. The ball is slippery. Careful, guys. Line up! - Jean-Phi, inside! - Mark! Outside! See you later. - Clear! - Come on. Come on. Thanks. - Block it! - Here! - Knitters! - Brave! - We'll do well. - Good luck. To rugby. To freedom. Take a deep breath, guys. Breathe. We're counting on you. - Here we are. - Believe in yourselves. There's someone behind. Someone's right on your arse, on all your arses. Come on, we're all leaders. We're all leaders. How did we get here? We owe this to no-one. We worked hard to get here. - We're counting on you, guys. - Come on, big guys. Push! Come on! Breathe out. Let go. Jog on the spot. Knees up. It wasn't all for nothing. The bouclier is ours, we need it. They can make it. They played well in the semis. Look, here's your daughter. Hi, Marie. - Hello, Jacques. - Hi, Fred. Hi, Alix. - She's upset with you? - A bit. You could have said hello. Why are we here today? We're here for the family. We're family. The stand, our friends, they're all family. The injured, people who couldn't make it or are no longer with us. A brother, a grandfather, a friend. They're proud of us, they support us. Despite all we've been through, we're still here. It's the last hurdle. One more hurdle! We're not going to fall. We're going to make it. We know what to do. We have a plan. We are strong. Together we are strong. We might never play together again or see each other again. Now's the time to externalise and leave our problems behind. Let's vent our anger here, together. Come on, tighter. Knitters! Knitters! We couldn't miss it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Good luck. I'll fuck your mum. Can the Knitters jump? Yes, they can! Don't worry, you made the right decision. I promise you. Knitters! Knitters! Come on! Come on, Filou! Pass it! - Play large! - Hold on to him, Quequette. We've got the ball! Go Knitters! - Thank you! - We've got it. Take your positions. Ready. - Out. Left. - I've got it. Tacklers! Come on, sweep it out. Referee, it's a foul. I don't believe it. Come on, ref. - Don't back down. - Nearly there. We're still ahead, guys. Positions! - It's shit. - Wipe his shoe. All right? In defence, we're at home here! It's okay, guys. Back off. Come on, guys. Go Knitters! Knitters! We're going to come for you, and give you the thrashing of your life. We'll see about that. All right, calm down. Back off. - Get off! - Let me go. Take them both and finish them off. You're done, gentlemen. That's not how you play. Thanks a lot. Are you stupid or what? Why did you do that? It's over, for fuck's sake. Take a shower. Get lost! Show me. Look at me. - Sit down. - Come here. Spit. Sorry, Vital. We go for their forwards. I'm changing everything to revive our game. Send them back home. Courage, guys! Stay proud! The ball, Manu. To me. Come on, guys. Heads down. Come on, guys. It's not over yet. We still have a shot. Ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for taking part in the final of the French Corporate League. There can only be one winner, and the winning team is Matra Olympic. The losing team is Knitters Rugby Club. Good match, Captain. Well done. Good match. Well done. Good match.
