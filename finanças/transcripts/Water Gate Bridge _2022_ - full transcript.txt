Is everyone alright? The cannons we seized got all blown up before I could play with them. All of your cannons were taken from the enemy, weren't they? Go take more of them. 7th Company. Present!

We're here to celebrate 5 years since 1945. And for that we have only one man to thank. Urgent news from the front, sir. And whose vision has brought these glories to fruition. General Douglas MacArthur! MacArthur here. Sir, Tokyo on the line. Yes. General. Task officer O.P. Smith reporting. As of right now, Hagaru-ri airstrip is the rear line. We don't have enough troops to hold off the enemy. I'm requesting reinforcements to support our withdrawal route. General, our troops need to get out of... Smith! This is war! Retreating is treason! I repeat! Retreating is treason! You think he knows we can hear him? Stop all retreating maneuvers! - General! - That's an order! Your request is denied! Can that plane take off? No, sir. They are stuck right in the middle of the fire line, sir! God! Go! go! This way! Get up there! Fire! - Reload! - Fire! Fire! Fire! Go! Let's go! We got everybody on board, Captain. Got it! Get ready! Fire! Turn the other one around! Have it take off from the main road! C°PY that! Move! Send reinforcements out to the Sumun Bridge as soon as possible. Call the bombers to clear the route right now! I'll go ahead and take command of the 1st Marine Division. Lead them out on the road to Hungnam Harbor, clear? Yes, sir! Gmgo! We made it. We gonna be okay. All units, full retreat! Get your men and get out of here! Everybody in the trucks! Evacuate! Move it! Move it! Watch out! Wu Qianli! Go seize four more cannons for us! 2 site down! Okay- Fire! The U.S. forces at Hagaru-ri have already given up and started to evacuate towards the south. According to our reports, the U.S. doesn't have enough cargo capacity. Smith is taking the rest of the troops and retreating towards the Hungnam Port through the Sumun Bridge. The Sumun Bridge is their only route to retreat. Only if we bomb it can our units get a chance to besiege them. Yes! Send a unit to launch penetration attacks. We can't let them escape! Order assigned forces to block them and cut off their retreat. The 9th Company is already close to the Sumun Bridge. The 7th Company of the 1st Storming Regiment is qualified for the mission. However, the 7th Company is at the airport now. Order the 7th Company to withdraw from battle and head towards the Sumun Bridge immediately. Blast the bridge! When our reinforcements arrive, annihilate the U.S. 1st Marine Division. Yes, sir! Notify the 7th Company now. Yes, sir! 7th Company, keep "P! Check the room in the south. Beware of ambush. Put the ammo box here. There's more here. 2nd Squad, count them. Hurry! The retreat route has been cleared of the enemy. Are there any wounded remaining at the airstrip? Hagaru-ri, do you copy? All units, the retreat route has been cleared of the enemy. Confirmed 500 reds wiped out over. I repeat... Are... Those who can still walk, go over there. Get the wounded into the room. Put the medical supplies in the tent. Put him on the bed. Check his condition later. How many? Almost 207 Never mind. I'll make sure you all go home alive. We will. Your frostbite is too bad. This will hurt a bit. I'll apply some ointment to it. I'm alright, Commander Zhang. Stop pretending. We know it hurts. Take the badly wounded to the front line hospital. Yes, sir! I'll notify the corpsman. Come, it's less windy here. It's not that cold. Bro, is it ready? Almost. Wait a second. I'll be done soon. There's more here. All commanders, time for meeting. Each platoon report your casualties. 1st Platoon downsized by 23 men. 2nd Platoon downsized by 21 men. 3rd Platoon downsized by 18 men. 4th Platoon, 16 casualties. 78 Only 9 Party members remain in our company. This is a critical moment. Get yourself together. Yes, sir! Commander, it's the HQ. This is Zhang Zhuang speaking. HQ here. 7th Company march south to approach the U.S. Army. Stay at 1081 Highland when you reach the Sumun Bridge. Wait for the order of blasting the bridge. Do you copy? COPY- This thing that can go straight up and down is their new equipment. In the future, we will have our own planes way better than theirs. Just a matter of time. Get ready for departure. Yes, sir. Come in please. Mr. President, telegram from Far East Command. General MacArthur is still pushing for use of the A-bomb. He believes this will bring the turning point we need to win the war. He is awaiting your response. MacArthur must be reminded that this war is bigger than one man. Yes, Mr. President. We will take whatever steps are necessary to meet the military situation just as we always have. Mr. President, Does that include use of the atomic bomb? Mr. President, perhaps it would be better if we are allowed to quote your remarks on that directly? Does this mean that we wouldn't use the atomic bomb except on a United Nations authorization? The action against communist China depends on the action of the United Nations. Mr. President... Grab him. Pull him up. Stand up back there. Someone fell into the snow. We can't see the road ahead in such heavy snow. One, two, three, pull! Tell back row to stop! Back row, stop! Does the compass still work? Damn, it's frozen. We've gone so far and still can't see a sign of the Sumun Bridge. Everyone stay alert! 1st Platoon, stop and stay alert! 3rd and 4th Platoons, stop and stay alert! Yu Congrong, the radio transmitter. Wanli, give me the radio transmitter. This should be the Sumun Bridge. Is that the 9th Company blasting the bridge? I can't tell. The 9th Company should have received blasting orders before us. Can you reach the HQ? The batteries are frozen. It's down. Save them first. Co! You protect the radio transmitter. I'll leave it to you. Okay- 3rd Squad, move! Keep "P! Yes, sir! 3rd Squad, follow the commander to the south side. 5th Squad, to the north side. Yes, sir! Save them! Cover them! Cover them! 2nd Squad, charge forward! Hurry! There are landmines. Be careful, everyone! Throw that frag back! Save them! Fill in their positions! Cover us! We're the 9th company. Carry him down. Hang on. Hang in there. Knock out their fire point. Commander! Take the commander away. Don't mind me. Split and save them. Yes, sir! Don't leave anyone behind. Commander; all the wounded were taken away. Check again. Carry him down. Commander, we checked again. All the wounded were taken away. Retreat! All units retreat! Retreat now! Hey' hang in there. 216, Liang Youtian. 308, Fang Qiang. 412, Fu Fengshou. 423, Xiang Chungeng. The 9th Company... 2nd Squad... Have they pulled... BYO, the 2nd Squad has pulled out. They've pulled out already. Don't waste it. Listen. Save the gauze for someone who can survive. Cut and distribute to everyone. The wounded first. Come over here. We seized the U.S. canned food from the airstrip. Instructor, you have it first. Do as you're told and stop that nonsense. Open your mouth. It's an order. Don't chip your teeth on the beans. Changgui, what are you chewing? This is good stuff. It's a bit sticky, like plastic. (Chewing Gum) 269; Wu Haifeng. 281, Sun Yong. Take cover! Take cover now! Hide the bodies! ' Hurry! 1 Enemy Planes! Hurry! Carry them into the cave! Hurry! Wanli! Wanli! Where's Wanli! Commander! Commander, take cover! Qianm! I'm here. Squat down and don't move! I see what you mean, sir. The air is ours. Call the fly boys to back up our troops with some more fire power. Yes, sir. How did you guys manage to blast the bridge last night? What tactics did you use? Which part did you blast? Yang, tell them about it. Yes, sir. We used the old tactics of creating a diversion. Our 2nd Platoon made a feint attack on the north side of the bridge. We dragged out their formation, blocked their bullets, and restrained their heavy weapons. All these distracted the enemy's attention. On the south side, the 1st Platoon disguised as wounded U.S. soldiers while being covered by the 3rd and 4th Platoons. By infiltrating into the enemy, they could blast the bridge. However, they all got caught. But they managed to take the dynamite pack onto the bridge before they were killed. At the crucial moment, the commander fired the Bazooka and it blew up the dynamite pack. But there weren't enough explosives to collapse the bridge. The operation failed. Over this way, boys, over this way. Took those assholes a whole night just to crack this little hole? The bridge is our only option. And must be. Can't we just fly these boys out? It will be faster than try to fix this. We are talking about something we don't have. The runway is gone. Are we all clear on the enemy's deployment of firepower? Are the troops in position? Yes sir, as requested. Stay alert. There's nothing stopping these guys from attacking during the day. Understood. All units are in position, sir. The ground is hot after bombed by incendiaries. Bury the batteries in the ground. Our batteries might have come back to life. Yu, our border is over there. That is home. Exactly. That's our motherland. Our scout is coming back. He's from the 9th Company. Commander, Tian Xiangnan is back. He's from the 9th company. Commander, I have found their headquarters. You want to raid their HQ? It's too cold to stand up. We can't even pull the bolt from our rifles. With ten dynamite packs and two bazookas only, how could we fight them? Even if you catch their commander, can we blast the bridge successfully? What if the plan fails? The 7th Company continues to blast the bridge. They would certainly call for reinforcements. Then it'll be harder to fight them. Tell me. Is there any easy battle? The harder it is, the more determined we should be. Our army has already set a strategic plan. It's to cut off their only route to retreat. So they'll have nowhere to run. Remember, there is no if. Commander. Where is the wound? Our commander was shot last night during a mission. The plane opened its butt end and poured down bullets and bombs. After that, our men in yellow uniforms dropped one after another. What should we call those brothers who were sacrificed? What should we call those who froze to death after marching for 6 days and 6 nights without any food or sleep? There aren't any heroes who will never freeze to death, let alone ones who will never be killed. A soldier only lives for honor and glory. The heavier the enemy's firepower is, the stronger we will be. We must show them we're not to be trifled with. What's the ammo situation at the secondary location? last time we checked, we had double the amount we requested. 76 AP, 30. 105 HP, 60. 30 CAL heavy machine gun, 2. B.A.R, 6. 60mm mortar, 6. MK2 pineapples, 500. 30 CAL carbine bullets, 5000. Test 123... Good afternoon, sir. Good news, sir. Reinforcements are on their way. It won't take them more than 18 hours. Sir, we are waiting the next order. We are maintaining hourly contact. 3rd Battalion, 7th Regiment, on the move. Minimal enemy activity detected. Reinforcements reassured. Arrival on time. Over. On time. Well, Brad. That's a blessing. Have you ever played hide and seek? Played hide and seek, sir? — Yep. - I haven't done so for a long time, certainly not at Christmas. Well, we're gonna have to do it here. We're gonna surprise them. Go invisible, lure them on the bridge, then jump out like jack Rabbit and squash them roaches. Call it a day. Based on the old commander's plan, the 7th and 9th Companies shall cooperate and split up in 4 units. I'll take Yu Congrong and Wanli to raid the U.S. HQ, capture their commander and force them to surrender. Mei Sheng and He Changgui will attack the south and north side of the bridge, knock down their watchtower for attrition. Ping He will lead the 9th Company to go through the pipes and seize the Pump House. Once the bridge is under control, wait for my osprey whistle and blast it. What's the Pump House? The Pump House... The Pump House is their heart. You're the best bazooka shooter in the 7th Company. Remember. Don't move before the first firing point is blown up. Yes, sir. Commander, I have something to tell Wanli. Save them until we've finished the battle. Wanli, Commander Baili died because of me back then. I'm so sorry for that. Baili is my brother and you're my brother too. All of the soldiers in the 7th Company are my brothers. My brother died protecting his comrades. If I were him, I would do the same thing. Thank you. Brother. Wanli. Wanli. Commander. What? I... Well... What I told you before might not... might not all be correct. You... You... I know. You care about me. I didn't let you run around before as you might cause trouble. But now, run as you wish and fly as you like. Do it fast. Throw the grenades as far as possible. That's our motherland. Long live the People's Republic of China. Long live the People's Republic of China. Long live the People's Republic of China. Long live the People's Republic of China. Look, is that a radio CV? Yes. The radio CV should be very close to the HQ. The lights are on in all five blockhouses. Only one of the houses is not lit-up with a sniper staying on guard. I bet that is their HQ. Yang Wenjian, was their defense on south side looks like this last time? All of the fire points at the south end of the bridge have been removed. Looks like a trap. The south fort armed with heavy firepower must be there to protect the bridge. We must capture it first. Xiao Laoxi. Yes? Go to the north side of the bridge. Tell them no matter what happens, do not fire - without my signal. - Yes, sir. (Searchlight) (Down) (Leave now) Bravo 1 to Command, North Tower down. Over. Password. 79 Steel. The Instructor said something's wrong on the bridge. Do not fire without his signal. Take care of his wound. Yes, sir. If we can capture their commander before Ping He's team and force them to surrender, we will be half way there. Do you see that blockhouse? Blow it up and we'll commence our operation. Yes, I saw it. Can you throw a grenade over there? No problem. I myself am a cannon. Go ahead. Where are you going? Not like that. Didn't you tell me to fly as I like? You have to coordinate with your teammates too! Grenade! It's a signal from the commander! Artillery Platoon, get ready. Load it up. Fire! Full alert! Don't panic! Wait for orders!

Let's phy- It was indeed a trap. Aim for the heart! What was that? Everybody stay calm. Quiet. Are you 0k? What was that? There has been an explosion. Ask south tower to contact HQ! Full alert! Tian Xiangnan, bring two of your men to scout inside. Yes, sir. Zhong Dingyi, Shen Hailong. Let's go! Alpha Team to command. Red alert. Pump house hit! Wait one! Request permission to defend! Repeat! Request permission to defend! Over! Well, that didn't take them long to take that bait, did it? Not exactly, sir. The explosion went off inside the Pump House. Where about? Inside the Pump House! Oh, shit! Goddamn it! Entrances on both sides. - Block them. - Yes. Move it, move it! Everybody stay alert. All clear. Take cover! Did I miss something, sir? Was this part of your plan, sir? It was. If we win. Command, Command. Enemy detected in south-east. Over. Command to Bravo, cut out enemy's retreat with two troops. Relay my command, OVQI'. Over. South Fort, South Fort. Provide suppressing fire to cut out GHGITIYZS FGtFGZt. Hold the rest on full alert. We're going to wait to spring the trap. Over. Enemy at 11 o'clock! Open fire! Let's go! Get some men in there.

Zhong Dingyi, blast the north gate. Yes, sir! Zhong Dingyi. Yu, He Changgui didn't attack from the north side. There must be a reason. I'll go down to find their HQ. You guys go take down the key point. Especially you! Don't be reckless. I'll behave. Tell us before you go anywhere. Okay- Alert! South Fort under attack! Enemy at 12 o'clock! Ammo loaded. Ready to fire! Jesus Christ! Target engaged. Fire! Enemy contact! Get into positions! That was our command headquarters, you idiot! They got us! They blew our HQ! Leave now!

He doesn't understand! You don't see? We are unarmed! Bomb! - Where's your commander? - Bomb! I'm asking you. Where's your commander? Let's go! Come on! Seize the second floor. Take down that wall. So we can get to the surface of the bridge. Here's the blind spot. Need to go over there. - Yang Wenjian. - Present! Can you discern their firepower deployment? One M9 Bazooka. One recoilless rifle. Two mortars. That is to say there's a ten-meter space between each fire point. That should be where they keep their ammunition. Use semaphores! Fire on both sides! Yes, sir! (Semaphore: Attention!) (Semaphore: Attack forward!) (Semaphore: Against both sides!) (Semaphore: Over.) 15 degrees from the muzzle. 140 meters. Yang Wenjian. Here! Take this! Watch for me! Watch very carefully! Okay- Fire!

Forget about the signal. Get ready to blast the wall. This is the last shot. Hit the roof with suppressive fire! Cover us! If we go out now, we'll be within the range of their tank. If we don't destroy the tank, we can't blast the bridge. It's loaded. We'll put the dynamite under the tank and blow up the tank too! We can't hang on much longer! Need to find a way out. You two go to the south of the Pump House. I'll find a way to go in. Yes, sir! Co! It stopped. Proceed with the mission! Got it! Commander! Ping He! How are you doing over there? Commander!

Attention, all engineers. H1C: You have 3 hours to repair the bridge. Consolidate C1, B3 sections. South side. All units. Condition 1 in operation. Stay on point. Jesus Christ. If those bastards had gotten a yard closer, this bridge would have been toasted! You think we gonna make it out of here, Scotty? I hope so. God knows how many of them are coming next time. Gee. Gonna be another 3 days till our boys are cleared. That's 10,000 of our guys that we gotta watch out for. You know, Smith said this is not a retreat. We're just advancing in another direction. That's considerate. Better than advancing into hell I guess. Sir, we've patched up the north side over there with wood. But it still needs some reinforcement. And that's a problem because we are all out of steel. And we still need to fix that pipe over there too. Make it happen. Send another request to HQ. And get me more firepower around this bridge. If they blow it one more time, we'll be up shit's creek without a paddle. Yes sir. Hurried up, guys! Latest news from the front. The Sumun Bridge, the army"s main route for rear advance has come under attack for a second time. The 1st marine division is facing a major test. General, the main structure at the Sumun bridge has been damaged. If the bridge gets hit again, it may be unusable. Damn Smith, I told him not to retreat. Doesn't he know he could face a court martial? What's the UN's reaction to the A bomb plan? It engendered controversy, sir. Contact all factories cooperating with our military in Tokyo. Make sure to get that damn bridge fixed. Yes, sir. Yang Wenjian, where did you get that vehicle? This half-track was seized by the commander at Koto-ri. The weapon on the top is not working. But it can still move. No matter how many times they fix the bridge, we will blast it every time they fix it. As long as the bridge is there, our mission still stands.
