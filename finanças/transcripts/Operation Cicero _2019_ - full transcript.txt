Girl, where are you running to? Yeah, there we go. Nice shot, Lazaro. Right. You bitch. Wait, watch me. Ilyas, stop, where are you going? Mom, my brother's there. I have to find him. Please don't go, my little one. - Mom... - Ilyas, don't go. I can't leave him there. You'll die, too, my son. I won't, Mom, I promise. No. Promise. There is no winning side of war. No, no! No. Ilyas. Ilyas! Ali. Ali. Oye. I'm from this town. Ali? Brother? Ali? Yeah. You hear that? Huh? There he is. Ali. Brother. Ali, don't move. I'm coming. Ali, no. No. Brother, I'm here. I'm here, brother. Come, come here. Brother. Ali, don't stand up. Ali, no. Ali, no. Ali! Ali. No! Ilyas, hurry up. He serves a purpose. I'm glad we didn't kill him. He's one of us now. He is my little spy. He informs me about the beautiful girls in Albanian villages. Here here. Here here. Ilyas, bring two more bottles. Okay. Ilyas, where are you? Finally. Mmm, yes. Ilyas, I heard you sing very well. Come on, sing us a song. Ah, let's get you up here. Yeah. Come on, sing. - Ilyas, come on, sing! - Yes, come on, sing! Ilyas! Yes! Long live the Albanians! Long live! Long live Ilyas! Long live Ilyas! Yeah! Welcome, your honorable Menemencioglu. Ah, welcome, Your Excellency. Who is singing? Oh, one of our personnel, Your Excellency. Hmm, an interesting personnel. I will have you in the waiting room. The German Ambassador and his attendants are here. The British delegation is here, sir. Thank you. The British are here. Moyzisch, I am listening. You know that our leader is paying attention to the relations with the Turks, my Ambassador. It's not like the Turks will go and side with the British just because I'm listening to an aria. What a pity. A beautiful voice like this should not be wasted on the ears of the Nazis. How are things? Are you getting used to it? Ayranci is a good place. Yes, dear. Lots of kids' noises. Anyway. Cornelia, we must find someone for you. These balls aren't suitable places for beautiful women to come alone. Perhaps when the war is over. Men... Don't. My dear, don't embarrass my secretary. You're even more attractive when you are embarrassed. Something calls for your attention, Mr. Moyzisch. Excuse me. The document, give me the document. Mr. Moyzisch... Give me the paper, please! Excuse me, with your permission. Mr. Moyzisch. Please. You are disturbing our guests. I'd like to remind you that you are in the Yugoslavian Embassy. You, sir, can give a diplomatic note if you like. My own personnel, I know what to do with them. Let go of me, let me go! What's going on? One of the German guests have been arrested, sir. I want to meet the person singing the aria. Champagne, Your Excellency? No, I don't want more champagne. That happens to be the singer, sir. Oh, an interesting singing, mister... Ilyas Bazna. Bazna. So where are you from, Mr. Bazna? I'm Turkish, sir. Hmm, Turkish. I'd like to see you in our embassy tomorrow, Mr. Bazna. Champagne, please. I'm coming, my lady. I want it now. Ah. The Ghazi Pasha taught them everything except servitude. May God never destine servitude for the Turkish nation, my lady. It was just a simple rendezvous. He gave me his home address so that I could go to his house. I swear I didn't betray my country. But it's a lie. A lie. Look. This is betrayal. This is betrayal. Betrayal, betrayal, betrayal! This, all of them! What did you give him? What did you give him? May all of your lives end! Hitler will fall down and you will fall down with him. Ah, you scoundrels! You will go down! They wanted war. Finally, they've got the war they wanted. There is no reconciliation! There is just war! Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Russia, Bulgaria, Iraq, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt. Today, you are face to face with the great German nation! Long live Germany, victory! You have impressive references, Mr. Bazna. And you passed the security clearance investigation everywhere. You have worked a lot in a lot of embassies as well. You have a good understanding of German and French. So you speak French. What about English? Not so well, sir. All right. You are going to be the gentleman's private valet. The less you happen to know, the better off you'll be. Follow me please. I'm walking Mr. Bazna around the embassy, Your Excellency. Welcome, Mr. Bazna. Thank you, sir. Take him to the tailor's shop at once. Everything must be clear and clean here, Mr. Bazna, for the gentleman's right ear can't hear very well. It's a memory from the war in China. I hope you are aware of the secrecy here, Mr. Bazna. Don't share what you hear here with anyone. Have no doubt about it, sir. Good. Otherwise, I think you know what will happen to you. The tailor's address. Go at once, don't lose time. Yes, sir. Your bedroom, Mr. Bazna. Your name? Ziya. Thank you, Ziya. Come in. More beautiful. You are more beautiful than you look on the photograph. Mrs. Kapp, the photograph could not capture your grace. You are very kind. Your wife said the same thing. Mmm, yeah. Write it down. To the Office of the Racial Policy. We will, as soon as possible, be sending you the information of all our personnel currently employed in the embassy, for the implementation of the following proposal. T4, dated 3-7-1942. File number 218/83. Natural selection, Miss Kapp. It's the law of nature. How can we claim that we have built the Aryan race without taking the crippled and the weak ones out from our society? Miss Kapp. Is there something wrong? No, nothing. Good. I need the personnel files. I'm going to run through everyone's family one by one. Now, sir? Yah. At once. Here they are. Your father was a diplomat, is that correct? Yes. You grew up in Turkey. Yes. It is our duty to serve Germany everywhere and in any way we can, Mr. Moyzisch. How nice. But missing. There are missing documents in your file. It's only been a couple of weeks since I came here, you know. I will provide them as soon as possible. Thank you. Welcome, my lady. What would you like? Water and plain coffee, please. Ah, as you wish. Surely, we'll join the war. We cannot keep silent while the whole world is on fire, right? But I think we should side with the British and be on the winning side this time. What do you think there, sir? I've never seen a winner at war. Thank you. Miss. Miss? Are you all right? Yes. I'm okay, I'm okay. Must have been my blood pressure. Okay, friends, the lady is okay. You? Ilyas Bazna. Cornelia Kapp. At your service. I cause you some trouble? Nonsense. I wouldn't feel at ease otherwise. It was beautiful. I mean, the aria you sang. Thank you. Are you an opera singer? I wish. It's kind of like a hobby of mine. It's good. This is where I live. Oh. Thank you for this pleasant walk. Can I take you out for dinner tomorrow? Well... I stay pretty late at work. Won't take no as an answer. I believe I deserve it I must say. Would it be disrespectful of me to wait here tomorrow evening to take you out to dinner? All right. Thank you again. Agust. Agust, run, your mama's home. Welcome, my lady. Your Excellency, your bathtub is ready. Thank you. Ilyas, have you heard about the T4? It's unbelievable. The Nazis came up with this new thing. From what I've heard, they are killing the crippled and the mentally ill. Hitler must have gone crazy. Oh, oh. Ah. Ilyas, where did you learn the song you sang at the ball? At the mansion, Your Excellency. Uh huh. It was the favorite aria of the Ghazi Pasha. It is my favorite, too. Come on, sing it, then. Right here? Yes, now. Right now? Do it. I'm not sure. Mr. Bazna, sing. Agust. Not now, please. Look at me. Look, I'll only be gone a couple of hours. Okay? I have to go, I promised. I'll answer. I got curious when you didn't show up. Is there a problem? Hey, you go home. Agust! I'm so so... Ah, thank you. Well, come in. Please, come in. Welcome. Good evening. My son, Agust. I'm terribly sorry, he's just not used to having me, oh, I mean, not having me at home in the evenings. Good evening, friend. My lady, let me take it. Take this, Agust. Ah, ah, ah. Don't drop it. If my friend doesn't want us to leave, then we won't leave. Do you have garlic? Do you need help? No, I'm good. * Meatballs, meatballs It's very good. Really? Look, this is how we do it. We roll it first. Then you squeeze it really hard. Come on, do it. Wanna make one more? Come on, do it. You make all of them. To your mom? To you. Throw! This is what I could find for dessert. I wonder which mouse ate the rest of the cake! Well, then, I'm glad the mouse left us some. I'm sorry. The night hasn't turned out quite like you expected. Oh, nonsense. It turned out exactly like I had hoped. I've been longing for a family dinner for a long time. So how 'bout we do this again? Mmm, tomorrow? Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day for me. I'm going to be at the horseracing field with my superior, Mr. Moyzisch. How 'bout the weekend? How about the weekend? There you go. (door creaking Dear ladies and gentlemen! You've shown grace by attending to the Ghazi Cup Horseriding Race, held under the aegis of Marshal Fevzi Cakmak Pasha. In today's race, the German and the Italian teams will also be racing along with the Turkish team. The captain of the Turkish team is Captain Ahmet Celal Yakar. The captain of the Italian team is Captain Gulliana Gemma. The captain of the German team is Major Hans Dietrich Shroeder. The captain of the German team, Major Hans Dietrich Shroeder, will be racing first. You should come with me in the evenings. I don't want to leave you alone in these boring Ankara nights. Thank you. But you know I just moved. I will come once I'm settled. It would be nice. I would be glad if you provided the missing documents, too. Shall we get something to drink? The captain of the Italian team, Captain Gulliana Gemma. Oh! That's for you. And if you are interested, meet me at the opera with 20,000 pounds. I hope you like Tosca. Ladies, gentlemen, the play will begin in three minutes. I have seen you before, haven't I? I have. You were singing an aria at the Yugoslavian Embassy. Bourgeois pleasures you have, mister... Did you bring the money? Do you expect me to believe that Sofia is going to be bombed by the Allied Forces? Is that what I said? I, myself, would never read the documents. I don't care what's written on them. What do you care about? Money really. You do realize that you want to be paid in pounds from a German. Unfortunately, your currency is not as valuable as the currency of the country you are at war with. Money, please. Enjoy the show. Moyzisch, are you sure the source is reliable? What's his name? That butler. The butler we saw at the Yugoslavian Embassy, the one who was singing arias. How did you find him? He found me. And where did he get these documents from? I don't know. Possibly the British. This could be a game the British set up to deceive us. Moyzisch, these documents need to be taken to Berlin at once. I want you to take them. Me? But what if they are fake? You would suffer the rage of our leader for bringing fake intelligence. If they are authentic, then you have yourself a reliable source. But he must have a code name. Mmm. Cicero. Have these transmitted under the code name of Cicero, Wolf's Lair, Hitler headquarters. I'll be briefing our leader. You'll be giving the documents yourself. Your papers, please. Fuhrer has ordered for you. Heil, Hitler. So they are going to bomb Sofia. Nonsense! Cicero, huh? Is Ankara wasting time on ancient tales while we are waging war here? Sir, the intelligence could be authentic. Do you want to seal your fate with this? We will wait and see. Yah? Ah, welcome, sir. Would you happen to have a Model G camera? Oh, yes, wait a moment. You know, for the kiddo. Come here, my love. Which one of the hats do you like? What are we doing now? We are enjoying this beautiful day. Hmm? Come on. () He's fallen asleep, at last. Thanks to me. He's starting to trust you. I wouldn't be at home at this hour if Mr. Moyzisch were not in Germany. I wish he stayed there forever. I can't devote enough time to Agust. Where is his father? His father left us once he found out about our son's condition. Saying that such a defective son could not be his. I guess he only married me for my father's status. He was an ambassador. Turns out he is just the perfect son-in-law for him. Because my father is the same. When he understood Agust's condition, he told me to drop him off somewhere and leave. Think about it. Like he's a puppy. It's so hard to trust someone. I don't want war anymore. There's no war here. Eventually, Turkey will join the war, too. Don't be so sure. You are a strange person, Ilyas. It's like you have the power to resolve all problems. It's like you have the power to overcome anything. The bombing of Sofia by Allied Forces. Attention, attention! All the embassy staff is ordered to go to their place of duty under Von Papen's urgent code. So the intelligence was authentic. Why didn't our leader take any measure? His distrust cost us hundreds of soldiers. Send a message to Moyzisch. We have to find Cicero! You may leave, Mr. Bazna. The Germans will respond to the attack on Sofia. We have to finish this quickly. Our assassin will be waiting on a crowded street. You have to be sure you can do this. Don't worry, Your Excellence. Our ally isn't aware it's a shrapnel bomb. Von Papen and the assassin will certainly die tomorrow. And the assassination will be blamed on the Turks. This will determine the fate of the war. Oh, well, I see you don't frequent home as much as you do the tavern. As if you do. I do from time to time. I water the flowers and look at our wedding pictures. Feels good to feel married. What happened? What happens if the German ambassador is killed here? Germany would declare war on Turkey. And we would side with the British. Someone is about to make us join the war by force. Nice to meet you. Hope to see you again. Goodbye, take care of yourself, eh? Ah, mmm, oh. It was a beautiful day. Sir, excuse me. You've forgotten your glasses. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I want the identification of anyone who entered or didn't enter the embassy today! And I want every room checked! Yes, sir. You weren't at the embassy this morning, Mr. Bazna. I went out for a walk, Mr. Wellington. I lost track of time. Is there a problem? I hope not. You're cruel, Mr. Bazna. You're enslaving a bird. Maybe it wants to go home. Who knows where it's from? What's its name? Ilyas. When friends say my name, it looks. It's just a bird. We found it, sir! Sir, we found these in Suzie's room. What's going on? Take her away. Harry, what's going on? What are you doing? Harry! Leave me alone! I didn't do anything. I swear. I didn't do anything! There are spies among us! Nothing happened between you and Suzie, right? No, Your Majesty. She was just an employee. After this I think you'll be a little bit more careful when choosing your employees, Mr. Wellington. This girl has ruined all of our plans! What now? Would you like anything, Your Excellency? We'd call out to you if we wanted something. Get out! Churchill shouldn't hear of any of this. Well, maybe he should. Of course. Whoever has the Turks their side wins the war, Mr. Hugessen. We must finish the job before the Germans. We are doing our best, Prime Minister. I'm here because you weren't, Mr. Hugessen. Present arms! Present arms! Mr. Churchill, President Inonu. Mr. Hugessen. We are ready to give you more than you need, Ismet Pasha. We also promise to lay the infrastructure by repairing the railways at once to supply your army. We also promise to supply the border points in the Thrace region with antiaircraft again. What we ask in return is only that you give us permission to use the military airfields in Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir. Join the war on our side, Ismet Pasha. Be on the winning side this time. Ismet Pasha has a serious hearing impairment. He is saying, he cannot hear you, unfortunately. We're increasing the number of the aircrafts to 20 and doubling the number of antiaircrafts. We can give him 150 more tanks. The Pasha says that we will consider your offer, Sir Churchill. May I remind you that the last time you joined the war on the side of Germany. Ismet Pasha asks if you know where we are, Mr. Churchill. During Greek invasion, 16 soldiers of ours were put in a wagon and burnt right here. And you come here and tell us you want our country to join the war again, Sir Churchill. Some of them were my close friends. Sergeant Mehmed, Corporal Yakup, Machinist Ali Raziaphanti, Doctor Yilmaz, Private Mehmet Yilmaz, Private Hasan Guzma. Get going. Don't be late. I'll look after him. Come on, go. * When you're by my side * And speaking softly * Words you only mean for me * Somewhere deep inside * I start to feel * All the things that love ought to be * * And when you hold my hand * And look at me with * Something special * In your eyes * Then I understand love's mysteries * * And I know it tells no lies * I'll give everything I wish we could freeze time. * I've got * To you Right at this moment. Here. We have to convince him somehow. We have to make a move before the Germans do. Your Excellency, if Mr. Churchill couldn't convince him personally, what can we do? I am surrounded by unhappy people. Except Ilyas. Look at the man, he can smile even in the middle of this turmoil. A married man shouldn't be smiling this much, Ilyas, or they'd think you are in love. That would be a fortunate dream, Your Excellency. Milk? Hmm. Thank you. Welcome, Mr. Moyzisch. The list of children to be sent to Bulgaria as part of the T4. Check it please. By the way, Miss Kapp, I want your complete file on my desk immediately. Of course, sir. Mom! Mom! I'm sorry, my lady. When my brother got sick, I didn't know where else to take your son. Miss Kapp, we've found the missing document in your file. Okay, Gulsum. Agust. Shall we go out to the garden? When I was a child, I was very afraid of my mother. She had a heavy hand. Cruel. Every morning, oatmeal. Every morning! She'd put you in your place if you didn't eat it. She wouldn't eat herself. I understood why later on why she didn't eat. Because we had no more. No more. Then, she got sick. I went to her. She had died two hours before I arrived. Then it was Germany that raised me! It became my mother. National Socialism reminded us of who we are now. But we are at war. Tomorrow belongs to those who sacrifice today, Cornelia. How naive he is. He isn't even aware of who he is. How difficult this must be for you. A kid that needs constant care. I would do anything for him. I know. I know what you've been through. Agust, no! Come here. You can pass. Be careful. You didn't honk. Are you all right? I am. Well, Mr. Moyzisch is back. He had a dinner at Karpic this evening. I dealt with him all day. Just tired I guess. Let me check the dinner. Are you hungry, little mouse? Are you drinking alone, Mr. Moyzisch? Anyone can have problems. Maybe. Don't you? We've been looking for you everywhere. Where have you been, butler Cicero? Cicero? Is that how you refer to me? Von Papen does. He calls you that. I call you Ilyas. Bravo. Ilyas Bazna. You got my name, bravo. So. How much would you pay for the minutes of the meeting between Inonu and Churchill? Nonsense! It can't have happened. Our intelligence would have known about it. Hmm, but it did. I thought you weren't reading the documents. I don't but I listen. I want 50,000 pounds for the rest of the documents. By the way, and don't drink on your own, Mr. Moyzisch. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. Asshole. Ilyas. Your Excellency? Will you soap my back? Would you like to take a break today, Your Excellency? Break? Excellent. I've always wanted to come here. It seems really authentic. Come on, you sing, too. Join, join. Mr. Menemencioglu what were you thinking talking to Churchill? That the Germans would just sit in a corner and keep silent? It's your call. If you want to make enemies with the German Empire, tell me. It is not our intention, Mr. Ambassador. Couldn't be like that. It shouldn't be like that. I work as the chief of staff of your fourth army. Which, in short, means that I rank a lot higher than Mustafa Kemal. Mean, Mustafa Kemal rejected your request to be the ambassador. And after him, Ismet Inonu rejected it, too. Still, as you can see, you turned up like a sort of a bad penny, Sir Von Papen! But I am here now. If you break off relations with us and side with the British, no one can keep our troops in the Thrace region from destroying Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir. I am telling you, we can level this city to the ground With one single bomb. That beautiful Istanbul would turn to ashes. In short, it would be the end of you. Mr. Menemenci. Sorry, Mr. Menemencioglu. I know your country's structural state better than you. With your permission, hmm. The Nazis know everything. They found out. How did they find out? There was no one else beside us in the meetings. I don't know, Your Excellency. Maybe there has been a leak on the Turkish side. You said there were a lot of soldiers entering and leaving the train. Maybe if I had been there... But you weren't! What do the Turks say? They're at least as confused as we are. This morning the German government sent a memo. After this, the Turks are definitely not joining the war. The boss is going to kill us. Are you planning on being useful, Harry? Of course. Then go find out where this leak is coming from. Of course, sir. Now! Your Excellency? Mr. Moyzisch. Cornelia, from now on we, you and I, will be closer. What are you doing? Let me go! I'm saving your son's life! Don't. Shh. From now on you will do what I want. Or with a single order, I'll send that freak son of yours to where he belongs. Do you understand? Moyzisch. Me and you, shh. Moyzisch, find a way to reach out to your spy at the British Embassy. Tell him we are buying all the documents. At once! As you wish, Your Excellency. I... Great Britain's great intelligence service is snooping. We must find the source of the leak. But sir, it could have been from anywhere. Go look everywhere then! To Egypt, Tunisia, Libya! Go! You, you are responsible for here. You are going to look here. You're going to stick your nose in everywhere. I want records of all telephone calls. Yes, sir. Now! Hello? Who is this? I don't understand. So, we have a spy leaked inside and you're going to give him to us. You said it very clearly, Miss. May I ask what you like in return? New passports for me and my son. To go to Switzerland, to be far away from the war. They think that my son has some problems, that he is not suitable. Mr. Wellington, they are going to take my son to the concentration camp. I've got to get him somewhere the Nazis can't reach. We don't have any more spies among us. We did our cleaning up to this point. Is that so? Then, where did the meeting of your prime minister leak from? From the Turks' side. Oh. Here's what we can do. If I see what documents your embassy has, then I can understand exactly where this leak is from. That's the only way I can believe what you are saying is true. But Miss, I have to see those documents. Hmm? We'll come again. Any time. Will you say goodnight to Sam? I'm going to give you a chance. But Miss, I have to see those documents. The war will end soon. All of this will end. We will start a new, peaceful life. Ilyas. Welcome. Were you expecting someone, Miss Kapp? No. I noticed you left the office early. Do you have things to do? No, I just wanted to take a walk. Where did you walk to, Miss Kapp? He really is unaware of what's going on in the world. Cornelia. No. You hear me. Those kids at the camp are happy, even happier than Agust. Because there are people like them over there. They hold hands and together walk around the garden. They are fed well, dressed appropriately. They sing songs, folk songs. Mr. Moyzisch. I beg you, don't do it. Go. Do you need to be polite? Hmm. We crossed that line already. Don't! Mom! Open door! Hey. I'm scared, Mom. Hey. Mom. Mom. You'll never forget the sacredness of your duty, Ilyas. Your duty is above everything else, everything. Mom, open the door! Agust. The intelligence I received it's talking about an operation coded Overlord. We must find out what it's about at once. Maybe, maybe it's a new front. Or maybe even a big assault. Surely, we will find out. Good. You go, I'm coming. The next one is more beautiful. The one after that is even more beautiful. And the one after that is more beautiful. That is all they know. We have to pay attention of this, gentlemen. I'm just, I'll be right back. Miss Kapp. I left tomorrow's schedule on your desk. And you forgot to take your folder. Hmm. I know. That's why I'm back. This is our confidential information. Who got hold of these, how? You have a spy among you. I told you. Now I want the passports from you. All right? In these papers, there's nothing but a silly code name, Miss Kapp. Cicero. Who is this Cicero? I don't know. I just want the passports that you promised me. The passports are yours when you give us Cicero or his identity. But what do I know about catching him? Learn how, Miss Kapp. That's if you value your son's life. I want Cicero. Ziya. What's going on? They are taking precautions after the last leak. By the way, they asked all of the embassy staff to report any person with suspicious behavior. Please, keep your eyes open, too. We are not allowed to enter or leave. Yeah, yeah. The names I call will go to Mr. Wellington's office for a security investigation. Mr. Miller. Mrs. Tasev. Mr. Bazna. Mr. Bazna, can't you hear? Mr. Wellington is expecting you. So, how long have you been married, Mr. Bazna? Hmm? 10 years. Your wife's job, the place she runs in Maltepe, don't you think it's a little inconvenient? And does it disturb you that your wife works in a tavern, Mr. Bazna? Is this an investigation about security or about morals, Mr. Wellington? I'm sorry. I learned how to serve in one of those places. I met my wife there, too. You're living separately. Like you. Your wife is in England, right? This is the time we live in, Mr. Wellington. We all do our share in our jobs. Can I go to my room if you allow me? Because I don't want to be any more disrespectful. Cicero. Yes, sir, did you want something? Does the name Cicero ring any bells for you, Mr. Bazna? An ancient Roman philosopher, isn't that right? You're right. What's up? What's the matter? Nothing. You must have a problem or you wouldn't be here during the day. Understood. I knew it was bound to happen. We're all human, after all. Sometimes we don't choose who we fall in love with. When one falls in love, one doesn't care about duty. Ilyas? I was cleaning your room before you came, Your Excellency. Excellent. This move will open up the third front. Normandy will be remembered as the beginning of our victory. Overlord will be the end of Hitler. It's crucial that the people who will be gathered together as part of the T4 orders are transported quietly. This could be propaganda material our enemies use to fuel the increasing opposition. It could be... Hello? Cicero. Wait. Wait! Out. Quickly. You, too. Huh? Oh. Why are you calling me here? Where? Not over there. 9 p.m. at the square. Okay. Could you recognize him, Miss Kapp? No. The British now know that there is a spy among them, Mr. Moyzisch. That's entirely your problem. They had the documents I gave to you. Which means that you have a spy among you, too. So our problems are mutual, Mr. Moyzisch. You asked me to come up for this? The Allied Forces are preparing for an all-out attack. All these documents coded Overlord are in the embassy. This carefree attitude will cost you 300,000 pounds. I have the destiny of Germany in my hands, Mr. Moyzisch. You have a growing appetite, Mr. Bazna. Like a gluttonous child. And you have the attention of a child, Mr. Moyzisch, and we're being followed. The British. They noticed us. I told you there was a spy among you. Faster, let's go down Ulus from a side street. * Ah * Eh ah Towards the farm. * Eh ah * Eh Faster. It's all ruined if they see me. I am ruined if Mr. Moyzisch sees me. Don't worry, Mrs. Kapp. When we figure out who he is, you won't have to be afraid of that Nazi. Open it. I don't use guns. It's against my character. A gluttonous but naive child. It's not how these things go. Take it. * Ah Get out. I'll deal with it. * Eh ah eh * Eh ah eh It's all over, Mr. Moyzisch. Hand over the agent! The game is not over until we say so. Mr. Wellington. * Ah * Eh ah eh * Eh ah eh Who was it? He was right beside you, Mrs. Kapp. You must have seen him. I didn't. I thought you were worried about your son, Mrs. Kapp. Are you sure you're not hiding anything from me? Yes. Look, I can save you and your son. There are clinics for special kids in London, England. I only ask you to tell me who that man was. I assure you no one will know about it. I said I didn't see him. You know, from now on, you're on your own. May God help you and your son. Mr. Moyzisch, there's an urgency you have to know. It was found that the British Embassy was called from your phone. In fact, a couple of times. What do you mean? What do you mean? You have someone among you, too. Come with me! You lied to me! Did you tell him anything about me? Did you tell Wellington anything about me? Why did you get involved with something like that? They were going to arrange passports for me and Agust. They were the only chance for me to get out of the country. You could have asked me for help! What? I'm sorry, I didn't know you were a spy. Why did you make love to me, Ilyas? Was that a mission, too? Very good. I thought you really fell in love with me. I would have shot you right there, if I didn't love you. Thank you. You are very kind, thank you very much. How tragic. You have a very active life, Mr. Bazna. Let me introduce you. Ilyas Bazna, the valet, sorry, the personal valet of the British ambassador, Mr. Hugessen. Or should I call you Cicero? And you, Miss Kapp. You risked your son's life for this valet! And what's more is that he's married. This may be a camouflage, of course. It's the end of the road, Cicero. We're going back to the embassy together. Do I need to tell you what happens to spies? I guess not. After you. Stop! Stop. Both of you. Cornelia. Just stop, Miss Kapp. I can get you and your son out of here at once. You know that. Shoot him! It's a matter of Agust's life. It's a matter of little Agust's life. It's a matter of your son's life, Cornelia. Pull yourself together. I can get you and your son out of here at once. You know it! Think of what they'll do to your son in the Nazi camps. Think! Think of what Hitler will do to your son, Cornelia. Shoot Cicero, Cornelia. I can get the passports at once. You know that I can get them at once. There are special schools in London, England! Think of your son. I'm going to arrange passports for you and Agust. You'll be out of the country before anyone knows what happened. You can come and get us after you're done with Wellington. Are you going to risk everything for her? You killed Wellington. Things will get out of control. Ilyas. You can't make everyone happy. You know that, right? There will always be someone left behind, broken. Don't forget. Ilyas. Cornelia, get Agust. I'll grab his bags and we must get to the car... Don't you dare! Agust. He's sleeping like a baby. We have common pleasures, Mr. Bazna. Interesting. It was difficult for you to get what you want. But for me, it was easy! Don't get angry. There's no need. We still have common goals. I want the Overlord documents now! You will get nothing from me unless you let them go. All right. Take them to the embassy. You can't take them anywhere. This is Turkish soil. - Ah. The world is ours. I guess you forgot that, Mr. Bazna. Your time is ticking. Take them. It's strange that Wellington disappeared. We all may have our little secrets, Your Excellency. Your back? No. Not if you are working here. And little secrets, never! Hmm. Your chest. I'm having trouble getting to know people. Everything was clear in the past, hmm. I can't understand people anymore. I don't want to believe that Wellington was a traitor. You're a very good valet, Mr. Bazna. That's very kind of you, Your Excellency. Get out. What do you want from me? I told you everything I know upstairs. I took everything I want from you. I don't even care about the things you're telling me. Don't. You could have brightened me up with your grace, too. What is it? He's here, Mr. Moyzisch. Who? Cicero. Where's Cornelia? The money is here. The documents? The woman and the child first. Otherwise you can't get anything from me. I thought you were doing all of this for the money. Where are they? You know, you won't come out of this alive, right? I guarantee you, Mr. Moyzisch, that will be the last thing on your mind when you take your last breath. The boy is on the road. The boy was sent to Bulgaria. Come, Mr. Bazna. You are too famous for a valet, Mr. Bazna. Mr. Bazna, why are you doing this? Risking everything for a woman. Would you believe me if I said love? Love. This is why we are not on the same side. Miss Cornelia is here. But her son was sent to the camp. Hmm, the woman and the child first. Then the Overlord documents in the place and time of my choosing. An interesting offer. The future of Germany depends on these two people you will give to me. If the British were to win, it would be a shame for this beautiful friendship we developed. Good. Release Miss Cornelia. Where is Agust? How long do we have to go? Where is this camp? It's outside of the city. We'll be there soon. Quick, I beg of you. Ilyas, will we be there on time? Don't worry, I made that mistake once. Attention, attention! Do not look the soldiers in the eye! Act according to the camp rules! Bow your head while walking! Attention, attention! Do not look the soldiers in the eye! Act according to camp rules! Bow your head when walking! Get undressed! I need everyone to hurry up! Aren't they ready yet? No, ma'am, not yet. Then don't have them get undressed. Hurry up! Quick! Come on, now. Get to the doors now! Stop or I'll shoot! No, don't fire! Stop, stop! I have an order written by Ministry of the Interior. Put your hands up in the air. Slowly. Toys. Wait, kid. Agust! Agust! - Cornelia! Please don't shoot me. Wait! Stop! Agust! Agust. Get off! No, wait! He's alive. Come on. I swear he's alive. Oh no! He is alive. My son isn't dead. He's alive, Ilyas. - Shh, shh, shh. Mom! - Agust, Agust! - Mom. Agust, oh. Look at me, look at me, yes. Don't be afraid, I'm here. We could have done something for the other children. Who said we didn't? How? With a heavy bribe. Release all the children. All the children? Yes, all of them. With the fake pounds your guys printed to hit the British economy. Ilyas, what are you doing? They've been fake all along. Fake? Well, then why? I'll tell you one day. Well done, Agust. So you still haven't told me. What did you give them to save us? An empty bay in Norway. Where are those pigs? Who are you, Ilyas Bazna? [Ilyas Only one Turk in the world changed the destiny of World War II. He caused the Germans to lose the war. You may come in. Welcome, Ilyas. Now I'm going to give you the most important duty of your life. But you'll have to be really patient. It's obvious that this Hitler will draw the world into a big war. This is what it looks like. You and your friends, as this country's first personnel of the National Correspondence Organization, will keep our young republic out of this dirty war under all circumstances. Yes, my Pasha. Cicero. During World War II, Ilyas Bazna gave 15 intelligence reports and documents that he stole from the British and gave to the Germans. The contents of the reports and the documents were true but their timings were changed.
