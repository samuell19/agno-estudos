(sweeping instrumental music) (eerie music) (tires squealing) - Come on! - They're right on top of us! (cars thudding) (men grunting) (dramatic music) - Derek, you okay man? (tires crunching) (door clattering) (dramatic music) - [Man] Don't worry, he won't get far. (dramatic music) - [Man] You know, it's such a shame to see an upstanding citizen driving drunk, don't you think? - [Man] Good way to get yourself killed. - [Man] Come on. (dramatic suspenseful music) (man grunts) (man yells) (foreboding music) (baseball thwacks) (crowd cheers) - [Man] You shoulda had that. (players cheering) - [Matt] Hey Coach! Thanks, guys. - I take back what I said about that ratty old cap. It seems to be working. - Yeah? - Your dad be proud to have you wearing it. (slow instrumental music) - See ya, Coach. Hey Dad. We won today. I hit a home run. Coach Everly even smiled. Mom's okay. She works all the time. But it's cool. I think she's trying not to miss you. (sniffles) I miss you Dad. (somber music) See ya. - Hey Matt! Where'd you disappear to? Everyone was looking for you. - I just had some stuff take care of. Where's Bernie? - He said he'll meet us at your place. - All right. (car horn blows) - Hey Bernie! - What's up man? - [Bernie] Hey guys. - Whoa, how'd you get your brother to give us a ride? - You kidding, he'd drive me to me to Guam if it meant getting rid of me for a few days. - Ooh, nice hat there, Bernie. - [Matt] Yeah, looking good. (Matt yells) - Yeah, that was good. (soft instrumental music) - [Woman] Ray, look. (whistling) - [Boy] Way to go, right? - [Boy] Hey, nice hat, Davy Crockett! - Ray Lever. What a jerk! They don't make 'em any meaner than that. - [Bernie] Or dumber. - Bernie, where's the other tent stake? - Hold on. Here. - Uh, Bernie? - Yes? - That's a pencil. - I know! It's stake-like. Couldn't find the other one. - You're kidding, right? - Okay, maybe we can make a stake. First, I'm going to go find some firewood before it gets dark. - I still think the pencil woulda worked. It's a number two! (soft instrumental music) (water babbles) (yells) (thuds) (foreboding music) - Hey guys! Guys! - Matt! - Matt! - Hey! - Hey Matt! (boys yelling) - [Matt] Think I found a hole or something! - Matt! - That was my eye, Lance. - [Lance] Hey Matt, where are you, man? - [Bernie] Yo Matt! - Hey guys, I'm over here. - Oh Matt, you okay, man? - What happened, you belch and the gave way? - That's funny, Bernie. - Sorry. (soothing instrumental music) - Matt] Whoa. Hey, there's something down here. Guys, help me outta here. - [Lance] It's just a U.S. mail mailbag. - Hey, it's locked, it must be something important. Let's open it! (thudding) - Wait a minute! What are you doing? - Hello! It's a federal crime to mess with the mail. - 10 to 20 easy. - Bet there's a big reward for it. - Hey yeah and then you can get that plastic surgery done, Bernie. (Bernie laughs) - Hey, at very least, bet we get our names in the paper. - This whole thing's kind of weird when you think about it. - Let's just take it in and see what they give us. - I just thought we might want to talk it over first. And what was this bag doing buried? - It was dead. - Funny, Bernie. - Funny, Bernie. - Look, what are you getting at? - Mailman don't just go around bearing bags of mail just for the heck of it. There's got to be a reason. - Look, maybe it was just lost or something and it got buried by accident. - Yeah, I guess. It's just weird, that's all. - Hey Lance, that your old man up there? - No, looks more like your mother. - [Matt] Yeah, maybe it's the mustache. - Definitely. - Can I help you children? (Bernie laughs) - We have something for you. Do you give any kind of reward for something like this? - Where'd you get this? - We found it in a mine shaft out by the old forest road. - So, is there a reward? - Not for returning government property to the government, there isn't. (grunts) - So what happens to the mail now? - It gets delivered, of course. Gene. Doesn't matter how old it is. Regulations. - Now let me get this straight. Matt crawled into the mine shift filled with scorpions and Bernie fought them off with a stick? - That's right. - Sounds very courageous. And what were you doing, Lance? - Aw, he squealed and cried like a baby. - Francis, no reward for these boys? - No, just the satisfaction of knowing that they helped get the mail through to its rightful and legal owners. The mail is on its way. Slightly delayed. - All right, so let's get a picture of everyone. - Thank you boys, you hold the bag. Oh, hold on, we've got to have the postmaster. Hey Jack! - Yeah? - Come on, it's the newspaper. They want to picture. - [Jack] Picture of what? - These boys found some old mail, come on, come one, come on. - [Jack] Oh congratulations boys. (ominous music) (camera clicks) (twinkly instrumental music) - Dad would have loved this. You know, he always hoped that one day you two would cover a story together. Too bad he's not here to see this. - You still love him? - Of course I do and I suppose I always will. But to get on with my life, our lives Matt, I need to leave the past where it belongs behind us. Let's not talk about it again, okay. Your father was a really wonderful, man. Nothing will ever change that. (somber instrumental music) (papers shuffling) (dramatic music) - [Matt] Dear Eileen, if this letter gets to you before I do I probably got myself into some serious trouble. I addressed this letter to little Matt to avoid having it intercepted. I don't have much time to explain everything now and besides, I'm not sure I could. Derek James and I have stumbled across some illegal activities. We're not entirely sure who's involved, but get your hands on Derek's report to the postal inspector in DC. It's about the Thoreau stamp misprint. The local post office should have a copy on file. Also, I've left you a special surprise where we used to drop quarters on rainy days. I'll always love you and Matt, Brian. - You thinking what I'm thinking? - We'd have to be lobotomized to think what you're thinking, Bernie. - Maybe your father's death wasn't an accident, like everyone thinks. - You're going to turn a letter over to your mom and let her handle it, right? - Or Sheriff Hendie? - No. - No? What do you mean, no? - I mean what I said, no I can't show this letter to my mom right now. She's finally getting over my dad's death. - So what's the plan? - Where you going? - Going to do all my dad said, go to the post office, get the report, find out about the stamp. You guys going to help me figure this out? - Yep, sure. - So the Thoreau stamp misprint, what do you need to know? - What is it? - Well, I think it was a stamp that was recalled. I can't remember why. - But they recall stamps? - Yeah. Usually because there's some kind of artistic flaw but really there's hundreds of reasons. - Do you have any reports on the stamp? - What it looks like, stuff like that? - Let's see what we've got here. Yeah, this looks like a dead end. Sorry boys. The stamp was issued over 10 years ago and I'm afraid we don't keep records that old. - Oh. - Sorry. I wished I could have been more help. - All right, thanks anyway. - Our government let us down. Turn the letter over to the cops, man. Let them handle it. - No, that's not an option. There's one more person that might be able to help us. - Batman? - Steve Young? - Eddie Vedder? - Pope John Paul! - No. Tarra Janes. - Ugh, good luck! She's not going to help you. She might hurt you, but she won't help you. - Come on guys, the letter said that her dad wrote a report about the stamp. So maybe she has it. It's worth a shot. (balls clattering) (low chattering) - No way! - Yeah, you sure you want to do this? - Guys, he was my dad. I got to see this through. - So we'll just stay out here and watch your back. - Yeah. - Thanks guys. - Good luck buddy. - Yeah, show 'em who's boss! - You da man! - Well, well, well. What have we here? You must be seriously lost, kid. - You know, we could go in there and help him. - Yeah, we could do that. - I need to talk to Tarra. - You're kidding, right. Hey Tarra, junior here says he wants to have a word with you. - Tell him I'm not here. (balls clattering) - She says she's not here, sport. Anything I can do to help you? - Could you tell her it's really important? - That's different, why didn't you say so in the first place? Tarra he says it's real important. Sorry. (thuds) (grunts) You wanna make something of this? I didn't think so. - Matt, you okay, man? - So, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit? - Well, I think I may have stumbled across something. I'm not sure but... - Stumbled across something, could you be more specific? - How about the missing Thoreau misprint? - You found it? - Well no, not exactly but something did happen. Kester's kid came by the post office today with a couple of his friends and they were asking a bunch of questions about it. They said it was for some school project - Probably just a coincidence. - I checked them out. The kids aren't even in school right now. They're off track, there's no project. - Still doesn't prove anything. - Yeah, well I check the records on that bag of mail. It was reported missing one day after our little incident in the woods. - What was in it? - I don't know. It was processed and delivered before I knew about it. (laughs) - You idiot. What do you think Kester had a letter about the stamp in that bag? If that were true, Jack, why isn't the sheriff banging on my door right now? - Look, maybe Kester didn't know about us until that night, but he did know where the stamp was. Now I know it's a long shot but it's possibly wrote a letter to somebody. - Yeah, that is a long shot. - Well, even so you want to keep your eye on these kids, see what develops. - Me? - Yes, you. This isn't my deal. - Really? And why is that Jack? - Well, 'cause things are different now. I got Kathy and the kids and I don't care about this stamp anymore. I just want to forget about the whole thing. - Forget about it. (ominous music) - Think the town would just forget about it if they knew? How 'bout the cops, you think they'd just forget about it. Jack, you are the one who filed a misprint in the inventory. It was your idea to keep it and it was your fault that Derek Janes found out about it and wrote that report! This all falls on your shoulders. - Look, how was I supposed to know he was going to call the newspaper and get Kester involved? - If this thing isn't handled properly Jack, you'll lose that precious little family of yours like that. - Look, I just want out of this, all right. - Two ways out Jack, one involves us getting rich the other involves us behind bars. There are no other choices. - No other choices. (thunder rumbles) - Matt? Hey. I love the rain. - Yeah. - You know, I think it's time for you to get to bed. It's getting late. Goodnight sweetheart? - Mom... Where did you and dad used to go on rainy days? - That's a weird question. - I'm a weird kid, remember. - TJ rocks. That's where everybody went. - Where is it? - You know that old abandoned restaurant across from the drive in? - Yeah, it's all boarded up. - Yeah, but it was great in it's time. They had a really cool Wurlitzer. - What's that? - A Wurlitzer? - Yeah. - Oh gee, I am getting old. Jukebox. I remember this one night, it was rainy. I mean, it was pouring so hard that we couldn't even drive home. So we just stayed there all night long waiting out the storm. We danced to this one song over and over and over again, "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain". (sweet instrumental music) It was just perfect. (bikes clattering) (plucky suspenseful music) (board clattering) - [Lance] Well, it looks like another dead end, man. - My mom said they used to come here on rainy days. We gotta check it out. - What are we looking for, anyway? - I don't know. Anything. (plucky suspenseful music) (Bernie yells) - There nothing here. - Yeah, it's kind of like your head, empty. - Would you guys be serious for just a minute? Come on, I'm trying to find out what happened to my dad. - I'm sorry. - Sorry. (door thuds) (kids scream) - Oh Sheriff Hendie. - Matty, what's going on here? - Uh, we were just checking it out. - Okay, let's go boys. (car engine rumbles) - Why don't you just tell him? I mean, he was your dad's best friend and you're coming up with nothing. Maybe it's time you bring the cops in. I don't know how much more of this we can take. - Hey, I'm not holding a gun to your head. You guys want to bail, that's cool. I guess I'll figure it out myself. - Figure what out yourself? You've got absolutely nothing! (door knocks) - Is Tarra home? - Who's asking? - Matt. - Matt? - Kester. - [Man] How many times have I told you I don't want your friends coming around here? - [Tarra] Who was it? - [Man] See for yourself. - I don't believe this. (door slams) (door knocks) What is your problem? - I'm not leaving here until you listen to me. I'll stand here and bang on this door all night if I have to. (door knocks) - Stop it! Just stop. Okay, what? - You know that last bag of mail I found? - That's what you dragging me out here for? - I one of the letters back in the mail yesterday. - And your point is? - My point is your father wasn't killed by accident. - Matt, it's been 10 years, let it go. - I'm serious. There's a lot more to it. Read for yourself. I went to the post office and I asked about the Thoreau stamp misprint. Nobody seems to know much about it. I also tried to get my hands on your dad's report. It's gone too. I thought maybe you'd know where we could get a copy of it. - You're crazy. - Don't you care about what happened? - I know what happened. My father was drinking, he totaled his Jeep, he died. That's all I need to know. - But there's more. Listen, ever since I was six I've always had this weird feeling about, about everything. I mean, it just didn't make sense. There's always been this hole in me where my dad belonged. (somber music) I just need to understand that. Don't you? - My father's dead because he was driving drunk. How do you think it feels living with that? That means no insurance, no government pension. My mom and I are stuck living here with my uncle and I don't need to be reminded that this is the best that we can do. - Wait a second! - What? - Just help me. - No. - That was your dad and me at the water plant. Got an AP award for that one. Found out one of our local factories was dumping its waste right into the town water source. It was a big story. Went national, got us clean drinking water. So what brings you here? - I'd like to see the file about my dad's death. - I knew this day would come. Why now? - I guess I just want to know more. Just want to know more. - I understand, hang on. It's somewhere. Here it is. I put this together after it happened. I new someday you'd grow up, you'd have questions about your father's death. It doesn't explain everything. Nothing seems to. Your dad was a good friend of mine. If you ever need anything more, you know where to find me. - Thanks. - What are you supposed to be, roadkill? - What's this? - My mother's recipe book, what do you think it is? - You found the report! - Ding, correct! Now, would you like to get what's behind door number one, or door number two. (sweet instrumental music) - Mom! She must be at work still. You want something to drink? - Yeah. - [Eileen] Hi honey, sorry I'm not there. I had to go back to the hospital for an emergency call but I shouldn't be late. I left some money to buy a pizza. I love you, Matthew, bye. - My mom is kind of weird sometimes. Her and my dad used to hide stuff like this for each other, you know, notes, beads, money. You like anchovies? - Yep. - Cool. - What makes it so valuable? I don't see any mistakes. - That's the point. See, everybody calls it a misprint stamp but technically it's not. There's no misprint on it. It was all done on purpose. What's the guy's name who designed it again? - Frank Carrillo. - Well, that Frank guy had a real twisted sense of humor. - I still don't get it. - Here, watch and learn. You know what that is? See this lady? - Yes. - Exactly. See, a small shipment of the stamps were sent out to a few areas around the country before someone picked up on the gag. Almost all of them were accounted for. - Almost? - Yeah, four turned out missing. Three sold on the black market in Oregon for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. No one knows what happened to the fourth. - So it was all about money? - Misprints are worth more than gold, instant originals. Kind of like fine art. See, post offices get them. They're supposed to report them and send them back. But those four just never came back. (door clatters) - Oh hi, I didn't know you were gonna have a party tonight, Matt. - Oh, ah, no. Oh no, yeah... Yeah, mom, you remember Tarra Janes? - Of course. But you know, I haven't seen your mother in years. Would you tell her hi for me? - Sure thing. Matt, it's been great hanging with you but I gotta scram. - Did you need a ride home? - Oh no, I'm cool, thanks. Thanks for the pizza. - Yeah, so later. - Yeah. - Tarra Janes, huh? Since when Matt. - Mom, it wasn't-- - A little wild for your taste though, isn't she? Okay, kiddo, good night, I'm going to bed. - Good night. - Your hunch may have been right, Jack. Maybe the two of them together does mean something. - Yeah, still don't know what the deal was with that abandoned restaurant. - Stay on him. If he's anything like his father, he's smart and if he's smart, he's dangerous. - What if he finds it? - Well now, that would be a nice problem to have. Don't you agree? (foreboding music) (soft thudding) (light tapping) - Guys, this isn't funny! (curtain clatters) (Matt groans) - Now, is that any way to greet a girl? - Is that any way to come to my house? - I didn't want to wake your mother. - Ah. - You can put the weapon down now, bad boy. - I wasn't scared. What are you doing here? - Is it cool to talk? - Well, I guess I didn't really have any other plans, it being three in the morning at all. What's that on your jammies? Are those cowboys? - They prefer cattle technicians these days, actually, thank you very much. Did you come over here just to bag on my nightwear? - No. I thought of something. You know, in the letter your father wrote how we talked about dropping quarters on rainy days? - Yeah. - Well, he was trying to tell your mom that he hid something in the place where they used to drop quarters when it rained, right? - Yeah, I've already been there. I told you about it, TJ rocks. There was nothing but mice. - Do you know if there was a jukebox, pinball machine, anything like that at the place? - Yeah, my mom was just telling me about it. Some whirly-whirl or something. It was a jukebox. They even had like their own song they danced to. Something about crying in the rain. - Yeah, Willie Nelson, I know the song. - Right. Anyway, they listened to it on that jukebox. Wait a minute. That's where they dropped quarters. If we find that jukebox, then maybe we'll find some answers! - Meet me at the county courthouse at 10 tomorrow. - Why? - To find the owner of TJ Rocks and the jukebox. (plucky music) What's up? - Where have you been? - You're right, I am 30 seconds late. I'm really sorry. - Hey Matt! What's going on? - Find any new leads lately? I thought you guys bailed out on me. - Yeah, well, we're still here if you need us. - Cool, thanks. (plucky music) - Oh, wow, we've got to go! We've got the thing. - Oh, at that place! - Yeah, we'll see you guys later. - Now, let me get this straight. You want me to locate the former owner of TJ Rocks? Do you see a sign hanging over my head that says missing persons? No, I don't think so. - Well, do you have any suggestions? - Try the tax department. - After the restaurant closed, we transferred all that information to data disc. Check records down in the basement - It's been up for state auction for failure to pay back taxes. I have a list of exactly what was sold. - Does it list the jukebox? - One Wurlitzer Select-O-Matic, purchased for $500. - Does it say who bought it? - No, no it doesn't, but we could try to data sourcer. - What's that? - Oh, that's the online database with the state. - How would we do that? - Fill out this form to take it upstairs to the county clerk's office. Small surcharge, you should get what you need. (change rattling) - Will take just a minute. (whimsical instrumental music) - Patrick Snelson please. Um, we understand that you may own or have owned one Wurlitzer Select-O-Matic jukebox. - [Patrick] That's right, still got her. - How's she running? - Just great. - Oh, so we'll go to Dalesborough tonight. Meet me at the bus stop at 8:30. - Cool. (sweet instrumental music) - Matt? - Hey. - What do you think, the black or pearl? - Pearls. - Yeah, I think you're right. Black is too bold. Ugh, I hate these hospital fundraisers. They are so stuffy. Can you help me with something? I never can get this right. - Yeah. (doorbell rings) - That must be Tom. - Tom, as in Tom Hendle? What's he doing here? - He's taking me to the fundraiser. - Really? You going out with the sheriff? - Yes, is that a problem? - No. - Okay, your dinner's on the stove. (doorbell rings) - Hey Mom, you look great. - Thanks. (slow instrumental music) - [Tarra] Come on, hop in. - What about the bus? - I just bummed this from my uncle. You want to take the bus, go ahead. I'll be there waiting for you. Look, I'm giving you five seconds to get in or I'm outta here. Four, three, two, one. - Okay, okay. (slow country music) Great parking. - When you have your own car, you can do better. (slow country music) - Can I help you? - Yeah, table for two. - Follow me. - I'll be right back. - What's the deal with that thing, anyway? - This? It's the key to my heart. - Oh. It fits the front door of our old house on Maple, the one my mother and father had before the accident. My uncle hates it wen I wear it, probably why I like it so much. - Yeah, I do that too, sometimes. You know, do stuff just to make my mom mad. - Yeah, sure you do. (somber music) - Why do you do that? - What? - Just throw shots at me? Sorry. - It's, it's just, you know what they say about people who live in glass houses. - They shouldn't throw stones, right? Well, that's original. You know what I say to that? Why not? All the glass is broken in my house anyway. - I didn't mean it like that. - Sure you did. It's okay, I know what kind of reputation my family has. I mean, I walk down the street, people stop and stare. Oh, there goes that wild Janes girl. You know it's too bad about her. If only her father hadn't died, things might be different. Well... No kidding. - Tarra, that's not why they stare at you. - Oh really? Well, then why do they, Mr. I Know Everything? - Well, it's probably, it's not anything bad or anything. It's probably because you're really pretty. (soft instrumental music) - Thanks Matt. - Yeah. Well, it's true. - I'll be back in a second. (coin clacks) ♪ In the twilight glow I see ♪ ♪ Blue eyes cryin' in the rain ♪ ♪ When we kissed goodbye and parted ♪ ♪ I knew we'd never meet again ♪ ♪ Love is like a dyin' ember ♪ ♪ Only memories remain ♪ ♪ Through the ages I'll remember ♪ ♪ Blue eyes cryin' in the rain ♪ (door clatters) (car engine rumbles) (suspenseful music) - Here's the lock. - I think I can pick it. - With what? - Voila. - I'm impressed. - Yeah, I know. Anything? - Not yet. - I'll tell ya, I'd forget my head if it weren't attached. (frantic instrumental music) This new alarm system is going to be the end of me. - You just have to get used to turning it on. - I know, I know. Now stand still while I reset it. (alarm beeping) Now, we got 30 seconds before this place blows. - Well, that was close. - You do realize that when we try to leave we're going to trip it. - Yeah well, we'll be long gone before anybody gets here. It's gotta be here. (alarm blares) (dramatic music) - Let's go! - No, I have to find it! - Forget it Matt, let's go! - Wait! - What are you doing? - I forgot something! - Are you crazy? Come on Matt! We gotta get outta here now! Matt! - I got it. (dramatic music) Go, go, go! (both breathing heavy) - You are insane, you know that! Totally insane. - Yeah well, that's what they tell me. - You had me so worried back there. What made you think to look underneath it? - I don't know it, it just hit me. I mean that weird thing my parents used to do, you know, hiding stuff all the time. (low moody music) You want to hold a half a million bucks? (both laughing) - Wow. Wait, it's been used. - What? - Look, see the lines. - It's probably worthless. - If this little stamp only knew what it did to my life. (soft somber music) (truck engine rumbles) (dark dramatic music) - Hey, Tarra, thanks. - For what? - You know, for, for helping. - Helping? Look, I've got news for you, Jack Flash, we can never sell the stamp and you're no closer to finding out what happened that night than you were when you started. - Don't be crazy, we have evidence now. - What evidence? The stamp, the letter, who's it point to? - I don't know maybe, maybe they'll reopen the case. - But who's going to do that Matt? Who can you really trust? - But I mean, you know-- - Face it, Matt, nobody cares about two guys who've been dead for 10 years. Nobody but us. (car horn blows) - He has another lane, why doesn't he just pass us? - Maybe he doesn't want to. (car horn blows) Maybe he wants something. Half a million dollars. (suspenseful music) (cars thudding) Hold on. - Tarra, come on, we can't outrun him! Just pull over! - Wait a minute, I got an idea. Hang on. (tires squealing) (cars thudding) (dramatic music) - Stop sign! - I see it! - Tarra! - Hold on! (kids screaming) (truck thuds) (dark moody music) (tapping) - You kids okay? - Yeah. - Step out of the truck. Come on. Hands on the hood where I can see 'em. Hands on the hook, come on, come on! You too, hands on the hood. (dark moody music) (police radio chattering) - Are you okay? - Yeah. - What in the world were you thinking? - I guess I wasn't. - What? - Thinking. - That's the understatement of the century. - Eileen. - We'll talk about this later. - Really serious about it. They ran a stop sign. - Where's Mom? - Where's she always is, working. - I'm really sorry. - Don't even say it. Let's go. (phone rings) - Hello. - Matt, it's me. - Tarra, what's wrong? - Matt, I'm sick of it, I'm getting out of here. I'm so sick of everything. - What are you talking about? I just want to let you know I hope your stamp helps you find everything you're looking for. - Tarra, meet me at the old Brookcanyon Inn. - I can't, I got to go, Matt. - Tarra, just meet me there. I got to talk to you, don't leave yet, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Tarra! - So what's so important? - You are. Don't leave. I mean, we're so close. We got to stay with this thing. - It doesn't matter anymore. I thought it did. I thought that if we figured everything out it might fix something inside me. It just doesn't matter. - How can you say that? Of course it does. - No, it doesn't. Even if we find out what happened and arrest the people that did it it's not going to change anything with us. When it's over, it's not going to bring our dads back. I'm getting out of here. I'm getting so far from this place. - Where? - I don't know. (sad instrumental music) - Where were you all these years when I could have used a friend? - Right here, just like now. Don't go. - Give me one good reason why I should stay. - Me. - What? - And you. - That's two reasons. - Yeah, well, they're good ones. - Well, isn't this sweet. Get away from the window. Go on, move! (low ominous music) Now give me that, stamp. - What stamp? - Come on, kid. Don't be as stupid as your father. (foreboding music) Just give it to him, Matt. - I don't have it with me. - Give me the stamp. - I don't have it, I swear. I ditched it last night. - All right. All right, this is what we're going to do. Come here. You got 60 minutes or she's never going to leave here. No cops, no parents, or it all ends right here for all of us, do you understand that? (low ominous music) Now I suggest you go get me that stamp. Get it! - Matt! (dramatic suspenseful music) - Guys move! - Matt! - Where the heck's he going? - I don't know, let's find out. (truck engine rumbles) What up, man? - You guys got to help me. Tarra's in trouble. Follow me. (dramatic music) - What's he doing? - He's headed to Mill's garage. Come on, let's go! (dramatic music) - Please mister, you gotta help me, it's my frat. Thank you for coming, I don't know what we would have done without you, boy you're a lifesaver! Step back, we learned this in Boy Scouts. Hey Lance, you in there? Sometimes it takes a little while. (both boys screaming) (all boys laughing) - You see the look on that guy's face. That was classic. - Guys, thanks. Now I need one of your bikes. - What is with you, Matt? - You ain't getting my bike till you tell us what's going on. - Okay, listen, if I don't get this stamp back to the old hotel in about five minutes something really bad is going to happen to Tarra. - And when you say something bad-- - Bernie! - Take the bike. - All right. Thanks guys! - [Bernie] Yeah. (dramatic music) - Matt! - Well, there it is. Beautiful, don't you think? Sit down. (low foreboding music) Yeah, it's me. - You've got it? - I'm holding it in my hand right now but we've got a couple of problems. - No loose ends, you understand? - Don't worry, there won't be. - When can I see it? - Soon. - I'll be there. (low ominous music) - So what am I going to do with two of you? - Let us go. - That's real cute, but I don't think so. - Matt, what's going on here? - Sheriff, don't move. I'm not foolin' around. Now take off that gun belt. Now! (low foreboding music) Good. Now keep it where I can see it. Back up. Drop it over the railing. Keep going. - Jack. - Drop it! (gun belt clatters) - What are you doing? - [Tom] Jack. Don't be crazy. Think about it. What are you going to do? Kill me? Kill the kids? - That's exactly what I'm going to do. I don't have any other choices. - Stay here. - [Tom] Jack, let's talk this through. - Shut up. - Jack, please. - I said shut up! This is real simple. I win and you lose, the game's over. (Matt yells) (thuds) - Stop it! - Jack, stop it, you're gonna tear the whole thing off! (rail clattering) (Matt yells) - [Matt] Help me, help me. - Hold on, Jack. (Jack yells) (thuds) Matt, hang on! Now work your way over to where you can grab my hands. - I can't! - You got to Matt. This whole thing's going to go any minute. Come on, Matt, hurry! - [Tarra] Matt, please! - Almost there, come on. Little further, little further. Gotcha! (Matt breathing heavy) (steps clattering) (low dramatic music) - Jack you in here? Is that you, Jack? - Afternoon, Mayor. - Tom, hey, what are you doing here? - Advising you of your rights. You have the right to remain silent. - Now come on, come on, what's the meaning of all this? - How about murder for starters? (ominous music) (low chattering) - Matt, Matt, are you all right? - Everything's okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - You're sure? - Matt, I spoke to the Postmaster General's office in D.C.. They said since the stamp has been canceled, it's considered expended. - What's that mean? - Means it's no longer their property. It's your property, Matt. - No way! - I figured Derrick Janes must have known the law and had it canceled himself. - Well, isn't it worth less money since it's been canceled? - Yeah, it's worth a quarter of a million instead of half a million. I mean, life is rough. - All right. - Hi guys. Thanks. - Yeah well, that's what friends are for. - Yeah, anytime Matt. Some new reporters just came. They'll be wanting an interview. Bobby, good to see ya! (soft instrumental music) - Hey Matt? One of my men found this inside, thought it might belong to you. - It does. - Hey. - Hey. - Get this, we get to keep the stamp. Thanks to your dad. He wasn't drunk, Tarra. He was looking out for you all along. - Thanks, that helps. - Helps what? - Fill the holes. - I guess. (sweet instrumental music) Maybe some holes weren't meant to be filled though. - Yeah. You're right. Here. I have something for you. - Wow. - Remember? - Yeah. - Don't lose it. - I won't, I promise. - Let's go. (sweet uplifting instrumental music) - Hey! - So what do you think? Stamp should cover dinner tomorrow night, huh? (laughs) (sweet instrumental music)
