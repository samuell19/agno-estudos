* [birds chirping] * [applause] [engine revving] [cheers] [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] [footsteps] [metal clanging] [bell ringing in distance] [imitates gunshot] [panting] [cocky laugh] [panting] [car approaching] You stupid idiot! [car peels out] [horses neighing] - [chuckles] - [panting] [catching his breath] Not bad. Not bad at all. Who do you run for? The customers. Ever run for a club? Me? No. You should, old chap, you should. You really flew just now. What about the Royal Park, eh? - Well, I run there already. - Eh? They take 11 pints and two dozen strawberry yogurts. What's your name? Harry Hayes. Oh, well I'm Stuart Simmonds, the club captain. Look who's here. The men from Mars have made it. Say, do you think that stye'll ever catch on? Ay, it's nice. Suits you, Harry. Oh, yes. What do you think, Chris? It's alright. Don't see the point in running, myself. They wrote Harry a very nice letter. They asked him to join. I should think they must be pretty short of people to run 'round their little track. I mean, only the rich have got the time for it. If the job's worth doing, it's worth doing well. [laughs] To Harry Hayes, the fastest man on two legs. May God bless him and all who sail in him. [footsteps] [overlapping chatter] Ah, Hayes. Good to see you. This is, uh, Ron Patterson. Ron, you remember, I told you about Harry. Hello. Ah, brought your stopwatch with you, have you? - Yeah. - Good. Lighter than those milk bottles, hm? Well, I'll try and find a coach for you. Oh, it's alright. [laughs] I'd rather run. Well, you'd better start over there then. [airplane flying over head] Who's he? The club milkman. Is that what he is? You want to run, do you? [out of breath] I wanna try. Think that was running? - Hm? - You were stomping holes in the ground. A runner moves over the ground, not through it. - What? - Ever seen a gazelle run? That's the way to move. You stretch and you fly. My name's Bill Oliver. Bill Oliver? Didn't there used to be a marathon star with that name? That's right. What's this? Oh, that's my stopwatch. I can see that. What's it for? Well, I run against it. You run against it? Run against yourself, not a dead thing of wheels and pulleys. It's the only way to be great. Throw the bloody thing away. [stammering] Hold on! That cost me five quid! [chuckles] You don't buy greatness for five pounds. [overlapping cheers] [announcer] Reynolds, number 54, of Yale, leading [indistinct] of Harvard, number 61, third is number 18. O'Brian of Yale. And it's Reynolds the winner! That's the meet! Great show! For a closer, I'll run the relay. Just one leg? I've gotta give Harvard a fighting chance, don't I? Scott Reynolds. In the flesh. Well, that's, that's when I'm at my best, baby. Ooh, you can't imagine how incredibly snowed I am. Yeah, well, you, you come and see me when you begin to melt, alright? * Hey, Richie. Hey, what's happening over there? Contest. Mark Young's challenged all comers to a chug-a-lug. Which one of you guys is gonna come and take on Mark Young, here? Hey, I'll take you on. Let's take a hundred bucks. No money, Marko. Don't wanna lose my amateur status. Well, what then? Well, we, uh, oughta compete for something tangible. How about me? I'm tangible, aren't I? And I'm sure you're an amateur. oh, I mean that as a compliment. Marko? Mhm. Okay fellas. Get ready. Uh, any of Mark's roommates here? Sure there are. [overlapping responses] Well, be prepared to lug out the guts. Reynolds, I'm gonna drink you dizzy. [Scott] Okay man, I'm thirsty. Ready. Set. Go! [overlapping cheers] [man 1] That's it. [woman 1] Oh, come on! [man 2] Come on, Scotty, you'll get him. [man 3] Two! - [all] Three! - [woman 2] Come on! [man 3] So much for college education. Check. [all] Five! Six! [all] Seven! [all] Eight! [all] Nine! [all] Ten! [woman 3] Take it easy. [man 4] He's finished, Scotty, you got him. [overlapping cheers] [woman 4] Cheers, now he's gonna get sick on the floor. [man 5] He doesn't look very well to me. Ohh! [man 6] Reynolds is the winner! Transit Gloria... the football players. Are you ready for the next event? You name it. Let's race. To my room. Are you warmed up? 902 Branford. I might win, you know. Good luck. [Vassar Girl laughs] [Vassar Girl yelps] [running up the stairs] What did you wanna go and do that for? * Where are the bloody roos? Be patient, Mr. Harcourt. Dammit, Sewall, we paid for a kangaroo shoot, not a bloody desert tour. Eight to five says we break down before we even see a roo. What do you say, Charlie, eight to five? - Aw, come on, Big Jim, this is supposed to be a holiday. - Yeah. What is it you chaps do, back in Sydney? - We're bookies. - No, we're promoters. [engine sputters] Hello. Aw, dammit Sewall, what do we do now? Here, call a road service. [laughs] Yeah, very funny, Charlie. - Sunny? - Yeah, boss. Can you fix it, again? Try, boss. Plenty old monster. Not much fixin' left. Don't speak Abo, Sunny, you can talk good White. Okay, boss. Well, that beats the lot, a bloody Abo mechanic. Sunny's a bright lad. He's a Pintubi. Hey, uh, what's a Pintubi? Oh, that's Abo for "little black." The Pintubi tribe, most of them live out in the Gibson desert. One of my men found this lad about ten years ago, just wandering He'd never seen a white man. Yeah, well a Pintubi's would have to be rat bags, to live in that bleedin' desert. [engine starts] Good lad, Sunny. Get back with Billy, and we'll be off. Okay. [truck door slam shut] - Hey, Arunta. Go time. Come on. Yeah, odds on the truck won't last a mile. Hey, look, look! There's some roos! Hey! After 'em, Sewell, after 'em! Shoot the roos. Let's shoot the roos. [engine revs] [gunshots] Hey! [gunshots] Aw, blast it! Some of them roos was the biggest roos I ever seen, - wasn't they, Big Jim? - Yeah. I didn't see you shoot many of 'em, mate. No? Well, they kept hopping up and down. Hey, what's eatin' ya? - Pintubi. - Yeah? Yeah, ruddy bad mechanic. Yeah, ruddy great runner. Yeah? How would you know? Yeah, he was racing us just now and gaining. Ah, what was it, a couple of seconds? Yeah, maybe, but look how far we come. Yes, boss. [flies buzzing] Yeah. Yeah, I reckon some of those Gibson Desert Pintubis, do 30 miles between water holes. Yeah. I'm really interested in that boy. Big Jim, if you're interested, there must be a dollar or two in it somewhere. Yeah, more than a dollar or two, Charlie boy, you know, there's a fortune to be made layin' odds on athletics. On horses, yes. But on athletics? Now Georgie May, eh, you remember Georgie May? He bought a Rolls Royce on what he made at the Melbourne Olympics. Ain't that right, Charlie boy? That's right. Silver Cloud Rolls. Now, what's your plan, Jimmy? Oy, get the boy down south and, uh, run him in private races. You don't just move an Aborigine. These blacks are wards of the State. You have to clear it with the Protection Board. Oh, hell, I'll soon fix that. Eh, Big Jim's got connections. Yeah, that boy's gonna be our Silver Cloud [slurping] You know that lemonade has a terrible effect on running? Oh, much worse than beer. Leave him alone. He's training. What for? Harry runs. [Oliver] Oh, I better be going. Goodnight, darling. No, not against Chelsea. - Well, goodbye. - See you later. Keep fit, lad. Thanks. [chatter] Mr. Oliver? Himself. It's me. Who? Uh, Harry Hayes. With the stopwatch. Five pounds. I've been reading about you in the Club records. You were a great runner. You find the watch? I didn't look for it. You didn't, eh? No. [stammering] Um, 'cause I thought you might be able to help me. Tell me, why do you want to run? Well... It's just that, I've got this feeling, you know, you're doing something, you feel different, you're doing something by yourself, and it's like nothing, or no one can mess you around anymore. Can they? [car door open] [car approaching] At my age, Harry, and even with this gammy leg, I could run those clockwork men into the ground. Vendek did it, and the whole world flogged itself to copy him. Vendek? He ran through pain to beat the world. [chuckles] He wasn't human. Well, what happened to him? Vendek? Oh, he's somewhere. You see, Harry. It's really fear that a man has to beat. Yeah? You go to your last ounce of blood, and then you get up and go again. I can do that. [bird chirps] If you could do that, Harry, we'll go through pain to the top of the world. [bird caws] I bought this place with my army pension. [scoffs] My disability pension. Even when I won the British title, the check came in each month. To the army, I'm still a bloody cripple. Ah, it's a miracle the way you came back. It was no God miracle. I made it happen, just like you're gonna make it happen up there. ...on my mountain. * Right. Back to the top again. [jazzy music *] Charge Harry, Charge! Come on! Come on, to the top. Come on. Right to the top of the world then, come on! That's it for today. We're getting close, Harry. [announcer] Runners in the British Cross-Country Championship nine-mile race should now make their way to the start line. Well, I think we've got an outside chance. Blimey, there's every club in the country here. Harry, you know my wife, Angie, don't you? - Eh. - Er, this is a friend of ours, Jocelyn Richards. - Pleased to meet ya. - Hello. Stewart and Angie have told me so much about you. Really? Didn't know there was that much to tell. [announcer] Nine-mile race will start in five minutes. Come on, Harry. They're playing our song. Wish us luck, girls. - Mousey, isn't he? - Hm. You said he was absolutely super. He's just a skinny mouse. Well, Caruso was just a fat mouse until he started to sing. Who's the girl? A friend of Mrs. Simmonds. No distractions, Harry. There's no time for them. How do we run this, Bill? You stay with the leaders until you see me get on to the course with this towel. Oh, won't they disqualify us? When you see this towel, you run! You think of our mountain and you run. Come on. [starting gun] [dramatic music *] Oh well, nine miles to go. [commentator] At the one mile marker, it's 885... * With eight miles to go, it's number 27... * [spectators shouting encouragement] [commentator] ...coming up to the final corner now, leading is number 885, John of Belgrave Harriers. Second is number 893, Hayes of Royal Park, and third, number 901 Vincent of... Come on, Harry! Go! * [spectators cheering] Look at our mouse now! Good God. [cheering continues] Now, ladies and gentlemen, The British Cross-Country Championship has this year been won by the Royal Park Athletic Club. Many congratulations. [applause] [photographer] Would you step forward? [flash bulb pops] Smile, right. That's the boy. Okay, smile. Good. [flashbulbs popping] Good, just one more. That's the idea. One more, Mr. Hayes. Well Harry, this calls for champagne. - Champagne Angie, eh? - Great. Well, I don't know what Bill will say about that. Have you seen him? Looks as though you've got a winner there at last, Bill. Yeah, he's good. About time, mind you. Bet he's out on the town tonight, though. [croupier] Place your bets now, ladies and gentlemen. I feel it. It's sixteen. Take it easy, Harry. You won't get rich here. None of the customers do. Just the club. [croupier] Twenty-five red. Twenty-five? I had that. She made me change it. Well, you only had five bob on it, anyway. I still don't know what happened to Bill. Bill, Bill. That's all we've been hearing the whole evening. Come on, Harry. Come and have some Coca Cola. [laughter] Coca Cola? What happened to champagne, then? They don't serve it here. [croupier] Place your bets now, ladies and gentlemen. Place your bets now. Bill didn't tell me what to do tomorrow, y'know. Never mind training, you won. Come in, I'll get you a drink. Is this all yours? I share it with a girlfriend. I think she's out. I think she's in. Didn't Bill teach you what to do now? I think that was coming next week. Well I'm going to give you a preview. Stop! Stop! Ahh, he's seen me. Shouldn't he see you? I don't deliver everyone to work. Thanks for the ride. We'll have a re-run, Champion. Call me. Morning. And I said there was no future in running. Harry, boy, I'm going into training. Now listen, don't you tell Christine about this. It was just this once. [John laughs] Sorry we're late, Smythey. Just been keeping the champion in trim here. [Smythe] Touch of the runs, eh? [milkman] So here's Britain's fastest milkman, half an hour late. Does it feel different, Harry? What? Being famous. Wa-awww... I haven't had time to think about it, really. I thought I'd see you last night. Ah... I missed the last train. I must go now, Chris. One thing's changed, though. What? Well, now I've got something I can give you. I won it. You nervous, Harry? Stadium's packed, isn't it? It's empty... ...but for me. Remember that. Who do we have to worry about, Bill? Ach. Just a bunch of nothing men. You'll run all over them. You're ready for it. Oh blimey, I hope so. You're ready for the world record. What? Vendek's world record... ...goes today. Jesus. You can run him into the ground, too. Aah, you shouldn't say that. The Czech's untouchable record... ...falls... ...today. When did you think this one up? Now. I just decided now. [commentator] Harry Hayes is breaking the world record! He's shattering the world record, in fact. The Iron Man's record, the record they said would never go! It must go now. The six mile record, Pavel Vendek's record, which has stood for five years... It's gone! It's gone to Hayes. The record they said would never be broken. Harry Hayes has brought it home for Great Britain. A fantastic win! The crowd rising to Hayes here tonight. [orchestral arrangement *] Hey Vendek. That's bad luck. It had to come. But to an Englishman, and so young? * Papa! They have stolen your record. Not stolen, Juri. He ran faster than I did. That's not possible. Is it, Mother? Sit down and eat, Juri. You can get your father's records back. Runners are supposed to be skinny, right? When I trained hard, I ate four big meals a day. Did you eat salad? He also ate every runner in the world. A slight exaggeration. Those were your words to me when we first me. The Iron Man. I want to be an Iron Man, too. Then eat! [officer shouting orders in the background] Colonel Vendek, the National Sports Committee has sent me to ask if... Not another speaking engagement I hope, Mr... Gregory Kovanda. It is really a privilege to meet the Iron Man. Ex-Iron Man. The new one lives in England. Believe me, we're all as sad as you are. I had my glory. You could still have more, Pavel. I... we... the National Committee wish to urge you to help our Olympic effort. - You want me to coach? - We want you to run. An old man running at the Games? You are not an old man, and they are not games. The Olympics is nothing but war in track shoes. - A political scoreboard. - Bah. But surely, Colonel Vendek, you know that most of mankind understands superiority only in physical terms. If the West can run faster and jump higher than the East, that means its political system is better. Illogical, but a fact of life. Still, 41 is old. Not for the Marathon. The Marathon? Just one race this time. Kovanda... My mind rebels. My body rebels. Shall I tell you a secret I haven't told anyone? I hate running. I hate it now, and I hated it then. It was all I could do, but I hated it. No soldier likes his job, Pavel, but this is your duty. [somber music *] All right, Vera, I'll run back from here. You don't want any kind of... ...I don't know... ...help? You are helping me just by waiting for me. Go home. * [whimsical melody *] Hey Charlie. Hello Mae. Where's himself? Sunny, I mean. I fixed him a training meal. - Big Jim? - Oh, him. He's sprucing himself up. You'd think he was going to church. Well, it's the big day. [chuckles] The first of many big days, Charlie boy. Hey, where's the dark horse? Still eatin' his breakfast. Yeah well, I hope yer not lettin' him stuff it in. Aw Jimmie, give me some credit, will ya? Yeah, that'd be the end, wouldn't it, mate? A fortune in palm grease transportation to Sydney, two months worth of grub, and a Pintubi brings his tucker up in the stretch. He won't, Jimmie. "He won't," she says. How would you bloody know? You been feedin' 'im like a horse. Well, you been workin' him like one. Jimmie trained a horse once. A horse that died. Yeah, not from bloody over-eatin'. Now come on, Mae. Get the boy out of here. You just treat him right. He's doing a lot for you two. Well, we're doing a lot for him. How's it look, Charlie? Well, we could get close to two hundred for the race, dependin' on the odds. Yeah, that's if he wins. If? After all what we done for him? Yeah, but what if he don't? - I'll kick his black ass! - Ah! Jimmie, you're a true saint. [laughs] [indistinct chatter] Now look, come on ladies and gentlemen... [continues, indistinct over crowd noise] Thank you, thank you sir. Nice competitive prices. Thank you, sir. Now look... Now listen, you blokes. You're stealin' me money! There ain't a black man in Australia could even run three miles. They're a lazy lot, all of 'em. Ah, g'wan Harcourt, I bet you've been train' him for months. Who, me? You must be joking. Eh Charlie, you hear that? Jimmie wouldn't know how to train a runner even if he wanted to. [crowd laughs] No, course he wouldn't. Here, Charlie... Come on, gents. Place your bets. - Sunny Pintubi. - Yes, Boss. Now look, you're a nice, bright lad, and I know you appreciate... [heavy exhale] ...all that I've done for you to help you get ahead in life. - Yeah, but... - No. No speeches, son. All what you have to do is get out there and win. And if ya do... ...couple of dollars for you. Thanks, Boss. I'll open an account for ya with me. Now go on. Whoof! Come on, get in there. Come on! [official] On the inside here, please. Thank you. [blonde man] The little black boy, yeah. He's a beauty. Okay Charlie, get 'em away. On your mark! Get set! [gunshot] [crowd cheering] Look, there they go, ladies and gentlemen, runnin' me into the poorhouse! Even money says the black boy stops in the bushes for a nap. We might never see him again. [cheering continues] Go Sunny, you beauty! You lovely boy! Blimey, he's faster than we thought. [man] Ah, don't let him beat ya, come on! Yeah, must faster. Too much faster. You're too fast, Sunny. Too fast. Slow it down, you'll muck up next week's odds. Slow it from here and you'll get your dollar. [Sunny] But... ...you promised two dollars, Boss. For a couple of minutes work? Come on Sunny, don't be a grubber. [cheering] He's done it! [gunshot] [bell tolling in distance] [groans] Twenty miles I've gotta run tomorrow. I never see you now. You're always running. Oh well, we'll be married one day. Then you'll see enough of me. I'll go into training for the honeymoon. Look, I used to be just a milkman, didn't I? Stuck down here. Well, I'm different now. I... I like the crowd yelling at me. I like reading about me in the papers. I like people knowing me. It's not fantastic, but at least it's something that I can do. [pop music playing on handheld radio *] I thought you'd have been proud of me. Oh, I am proud of you, Harry. I'm just... lonely. I miss you. Well... It won't be forever. Really? How will it end? I'll get to the top. How will you know? [clock tower tolling] [telephone ringing] That you, Harry? It's Bill Oliver, Mrs. Hayes. Ooh, Mr. Oliver. Fancy you coming at this hour. Well, I was just driving by, I thought I'd pop in and see the boy. - Oh, well, come in. - Thank you. So... [chuckles] I'm expecting Harry any minute. I thought you was him. He's not back yet? Half past ten. Heh, well, seeing there's no race tomorrow. Well still, an hour in bed is an hour ahead. [chuckles] Well, where is he? Saturday... He likes to go bowling of a Saturday. - Bowling? - Yes. Oh, it ain't bad for him, is it Mr. Oliver? Well, as long as he doesn't carry it to excess, it could tone up the muscles. Oh, oh I'm glad. Um, can I fix you something, Mr. Oliver? Cup of tea, maybe? Well... ...oh, yes. Thank you, I'd like that. And what's this? Harry's dinner. He's always famished after bowling. Oh, eh, it's only what you allow. [laughing] Very good, Mrs. Hayes. Ah. Optimum, as we scientists say. - Heh. - Huh. Date nut bread, ah. Very high in mineral content. Oh, yes. Peeled walnuts, heh heh. I learned all about these from Australians, you know. Ah. Fruit. Ah, you know fruit is the secret. It's natural. - Hmm. Harry told me. [pear crunching] And I swear, Mr. Oliver, there ain't an unnatural thing in this house. [chuckles] You've got a good boy there, Mrs. Hayes. He'll beat the world, you know. Hm. We owe it all to you, Mr. Oliver. Uh uh uh. You call me Bill. Heh, Bill. Heh. We're both so terrifically grateful to you. [sighs] If only his father was alive. From what Harry told me, the old fool smoked himself to death. Huh, if he could've seen our Harry's name on the sports pages, huh. That'd have been something. Oh, speaking of which, Bill, do you read where that Czech fellow started up again? The papers say he was the toughest. - Never beaten. - Huh. Bloody professional. Eh? Ah, these Communist athletes, they're all bloody professional. All part of the military, you know. State trains 'em day and night. Huh. Bloody Czech probably wants to be a general or something. Well, he won't do it over our boy. I can tell you that. Colonel. Colonel Vendek. You were brilliant in Warsaw last weekend. The Vendek of old! Right now, I feel like the old Vendek. The Iron Man has a new sense of humor. It keeps reconditioned machines running. Actually, Pavel, modern science does have some new devices to keep one running. I mean, of course, stimulants. No, thank you. Things have changed, Pavel. Everyone takes them. Then you take them. I'll retire. England is lovely this time of year. All tracks look the same, Kovanda. Next week you are in London. Khadi, Wilamawitz, and Hayes. You have great ambitions for my aging legs. Hayes has beaten your record, but he can't beat you! Is that him, Bill? Is that Vendek? Don't worry, Harry. He's an old man. You'll kill him. Bill, which one is he? He's over there. He's nothing. Nothing... You said he's not human. Don't worry, nor are you. [interviewer] Great to see you here again in the White City, and this looks as though it's going to be a tremendous six miles race. How do you feel about it? Well... [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen... I would like to introduce you to some of the runners in this afternoon's great race. Khadi of Tunisia. [applause] Lynd of the United States. [applause] The former world record holder, undefeated in 71 races, Pavel Vendek of Czechoslovakia. [cheering, applause] And the current world record holder, Harry Hayes of Great Britain. [cheering, applause] And now, in the stadium, the long awaited meeting, and it's Vendek that goes across to Hayes to shake him by the hand. A great sportsman, this, for what must be a very tense moment. The runners are coming under starter's orders now, for what should be a great personal battle between these two champions. [official] Okay, now. Ready. Get set. [gunshot] [cheering] [announcer] From the gun, it's Hayes that shoots into an early lead whilst the rest sort themselves out in the pack. Hayes looks as though he's going to take command of this race, and dictate the pace. A bold tactic, this, against Vendek. So at the end of the first lap, it's Harry Hayes that holds the lead, with Vendek having come through to second spot. And the big question is whether Pavel Vendek, at 41 years of age, can hang on for six miles and make this a real comeback. Vendek's job is certainly made easier by the fact that Hayes has taken the lead, which means that Vendek will probably stay back in second place, and attempt to beat Hayes on a finishing burst. [announcer continues] Ten laps to go, that's two and a half miles, and Hayes lapping it around 68 seconds, and looking very strong, indeed. But Vendek's still menacingly close on his shoulder. Third is Rewand of Kenya, wearing number five. And fourth, number 21, Stevenson of Great Britain. A lap and a half to go, and the crowd tense and quiet, but they're coming alive now, and it's the famous Vendek chant, as Hayes, obviously tiring, struggles to keep ahead. [crowd chanting: "Vendek! Vendek!] And Vendek, apparently rising to this, attacks now. He's going past Hayes on the outside. Hayes sees him and cannot respond. Vendek opens up a gap, and that gap is increasing. [cheering] This is the point where Hayes normally makes his burst, but there's no sign of Hayes being able to respond to Vendek's acceleration. In fact, he's in danger of losing contact with Vendek now. [cheering] The stadium goes wild. A great win, this, for Vendek, similar to the one he had in Warsaw last month. A great win over the world record holder for Pavel Vendek. [very loud cheering] [announcer, continuing] ...and Hayes is through. Hayes has collapsed, exhausted, after a great bid to close the gap on Vendek. What a race, and what a comeback for Pavel Vendek. All right, he'll be all right. He's as fit as hell. All right, come on. Up you go. I tried, Bill. I did try, you know. I couldn't go no faster. Yeah. [door opens, people clamoring] There's a young lady, sir, says she's a friend of Mr. Hayes. Oh, send her away. No, Bill. Let her come in, will you? Harry, it was awful. Is he all right? - Course I'm all right. - I'll go back with you, Harry. You'll what?! Who is this girl? "This girl" is his girlfriend. You know it does happen. You filthy bitch! You've been seeing him behind my back! You did this to him! I did it to him? I didn't make him climb up a bloody mountain - 'til he collapsed. - You! Shut up, Chris. We're going. Harry, we'll get back into shape. You can... You can come and stay with me at the farm. [reporters clamoring, indistinct] [voice on PA system] BOAC announces the departure of their jet flight 590... Melbourne, Sydney, Tokyo. Join a track team and see the world. Those are all track capitals, man. It's going to be a lot of hard work. Yeah, my heart bleeds for you. Yeah, well stop bleeding in time for Tokyo. Tea houses and August moons. Yeah, well I'll bring the tea bags. See you there, baby. Ha ha. [pop music *] Hey, I've seen your picture. On a "wanted" poster? Sports Illustrated. You're Cal Wood. "World's fastest human being" this week. - Scott Reynolds. - Yeah, I know. You know, I hate to watch you run. - Really? - Yeah. - You make it look too easy. - Ha ha ha ha. Will you fasten your seat belt, please? I was wondering when you were going to get here, Miss, uh... Gibb. Miss Gibb, I'd like you to meet Cal Wood. This is the world's fastest human being, and I'm Scott Reynolds. You still have to fasten your seat belt. Of course, Miss Gibb. Anything for you. I'd even be glad to fasten yours. [Miss Gibb scoffs] Thank you, gentlemen. Miss Gibb, come back Miss Gibb. We have so... * Hello, coach. Would you please ask Miss Gibb to come here when she has a chance? - Certainly. - I have to discuss Mr. Wood's condition with her. - Thank you. - Thank you. Miss Gibb probably bailed out. Listen, just stick to sprinting, will you? And for all other action, stick to Scottie and we'll have a ball. "You," not "we." Olympic trials begin in six weeks. By the way, what events are you going in for? Don't worry, Calvin. I'll leave the hundred to you. - Ah, Miss Gibb. - Yes? Look. Australia. We're up over down under. [Miss Gibb chuckles] [whimsical music *] Get the bridge. That's the Opera House they'll never finish. What about that, Calvin? - Hey, Charlie. - Yeah? Look what's there. Yeah. [steam whistle in distance] Well, it hurts my wallet to see him. Who is he? He's the Yank runner. Me and Jimmy lost $100 betting against him. Yeah, I doped him out wrong. Looked too pretty to be tough. He's cute. Why don't you introduce us? Yeah, might give us a few tips. They'll never get it off the ground. Hey, mate. Er... Scott Reynolds, isn't it? Ah come on, have some, Yank. Look... French champagne. No, thanks. We've got some pretty important meets coming up in Tokyo. Aah, Tokyo. What, you been there? No. I just said, "Aah, Tokyo." [chuckling] You people stage your own meets, do you? Yeah, we're... er... promoters, Reynolds. [horn honks] Hey, why don't you come out tomorrow and put down a few dollars? No thanks. I... I think we'll hit a beach. Yeah, but this is a beach, and we got this Aborigine... And I got this great idea. Hey, you like to have a few laughs? Laughs? Ha ha. It's what I live for. Hey, how about you, Miss Gibb? You feel like laughing? [Harcourt] Take six to four. Now, you blokes don't have to be experts to dope this one out. Excuse me, sir. Now look, we've got a mighty tribesman, and a flabby Yank. Now, they're all the same, these Yanks. Sittin' in front of the telly all day, swillin' beer. [laughter] A-and eatin' ice cream sundaes. Yeah, look at that belly, then. Ooh. Smart money bets on him not to even finish. I'll take twos... [indistinct clamor] I'll take twos the Yank don't... - Be back in a minute. - Go ahead on. [Gilmour] Give it all you got, Sunny. [Scott] Good luck. [Sunny] Thanks. On your marks. Get set. [gunshot] [cheering] Get a move on, Yank! Come on, man, come on. Go, go, go! How much there? $600 on Pintubi. We've got it made. Great. Come on, Sunny. Get a move on, will ya? - Come on! - He's crafty, that Yank. Lettin' our boy keep up with him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Come on, Pintubi. - Go on! [heavy breathing] Come on, come on! Come on! [cheering] [Harcourt] Come on, Yank. Come on, Yank, come on, Yank! And the Yank wins! You said he's some darkie from the bush. He is. That was a great act, mate. Act? That's as hard as I've run in my life. No-o-o. What, you mean the Pintubi really is that good? [Scott] Put him in track shoes. He's fantastic. - He could make the Olympics. - Olympics? You must be joking. Do you think I like eating sand? Olympics... Hey, where are you going, mate? It's all over! Olympics, er... What kinda money does that pay? No money, it's for amateurs. Is that guy an amateur? [man]The black boy threw it deliberately, it's obvious. Well, that depends on the exact definition of an amateur. Someone who's never been paid for running. He's an amateur, all right. Of course, I'll tell you what you shoulda done, love. You should have spurted a lap earlier. After all, he's only a Czech. Hard luck, Harry boy. Never mind, Arsenal did okay anyway. Here's to flash in the pan. You've just been a bit inconsistent, that's all. I'd say losing three races in three weeks was pretty consistent. Cheers. Harry. It doesn't matter. I'll just pack it in. It's not important, anyway. Go back to him, Harry. [crowd cheering] [speaking Japanese] Come on, Scotty! Come on, baby! Come on, Scotty! Kick it in, baby! [crowd roars] Beautiful, Scott! You really used your head. Hey, what's next. For you, nothing. Unless you'd like to give my after dinner speech tomorrow evening. Come on, Coach. I need more action. That's tough, boy. Well, what about tomorrow? Just the Marathon. Oh yeah? Can you get me in? - It's not your distance. - Well, so what? Yeah, I can put you in, and I will for a very selfish reason. I'd love, just once, to see your head handed to you. [people speaking Japanese] The Marathon. I hope you know what you're doing. What is it about that word that blows everybody's mind? [traditional music *] Scotty, nobody can go out and run 26 miles just like that. Zatopak did it in the '52 Olympics. Oh, come off it. He just said he'd never run one to psyche out his rivals. Thanks. Do you remember last May when I was going to Boston every Sunday? Yeah. You were seeing some chick from Wellesley. Uh, Paula something, wasn't it? Paula Revere. Oh, Paula Revere. You wanna know who Paula really was? Mm-hmm. The Boston Marathon. I don't believe it. [rock music *] [Scott] Four years at Yale and you still don't know the first thing about bluffing? My first week I just jogged, just to see if I could go the whole way. Then each week, I tried to cut my time. I got down to 2:20. 2:20? Man, that could almost win the Olympics. Damn straight, it could. And it will. [dramatic music *] You know, everybody on campus knew that you were... I mean, thought that you were... Listen, that fabled motto "be unprepared" has won for me dozens of times. Just like it'll win me the Olympics. [chuckling] * Yeah, and I suppose you really didn't walk all over Tokyo last night. You were really up in your room sleeping? Well, I got that figured out, too. The race is at seven, right? I'm gonna sack in all day and roll out for the start. I'll be fresher. Ooh, I'm tired. I'm gonna sleep like a baby. [Coach Rigney] Reynolds! I've been calling your room. I was afraid you'd overslept. What's the matter, Coach? Bed checking? [Rigney] Now look, I broke my neck to get you into this race. The least you can do is to show up on time. Hey, we have all day. More like half an hour. You get your gear and meet me in the car! Half an hour? Seven AM. Shake it, will you? Seven AM? Paula Revere, where are you now? Shut up. Come on, take it easy, Scotty. Come on up to my room. [Scott] I don't take pills, Richie. These are okay. I took 'em during exams. They get right to you. They're wild. Are they safe? Now look, Scottie, it all depends on how much you want to win. I wanna win. [cheering] Lookin' good, baby. Lookin' good. Way to go, Scotty. You got it made! See you up the road, baby! Come on, let's go. Banzai, banzai! [announcer speaking Japanese] Come on, Scotty. Come on, baby! You can still take it! Come on! Open your hand. There's a water station up ahead. You're as good as gold now, baby. You know, I'm- I'm thinking of taking an ad out in Sports Illustrated: "To all Olympic Marathoners," [Richie] "Turn in your track suits." Oh! Oh... Hey Scotty, what's the matter? Call the coach. Get the name of a good doctor. But tell him it's for you, not... You're the one who's sick, not me. [thumping heart beat] [speaking Japanese] There is no permanent damage. Thanks. I was really scared. But you do have certain cardiac arrhythmias. Meaning? Means heart irregularities. You should take no strenuous exercises for three months. Then get a checkup from your own doctor. Well... The Olympic games are three months away. I would not advise you to enter. What if I do, doctor? You risk putting too great a strain on your heart. And if you do that, you can have another attack, any time at all. How'd it go? You hear the one about the Japanese horse doctor? [chuckles] * Bill? Bill? [birds cawing] * Bill? Fed up with losing, are you? Did you think you could do it alone, Harry? Yeah, all right. I wanna try again. My way, then. No distractions, just work. Yeah, your way. [bird cawing] The Olympics are coming up. Well, do you think I have a chance? How would you like run 26 miles, Harry? Eh? 26 miles over roads, up hill and down. After the first five miles, you're head will be swimming, your body will be numb with pain. - The Marathon? - Why not? It's the final event of the games, the climax. It's the greatest test of physical stamina - ever devised by man. - I read about it. There were 87 people started, and 23 finished. We're not going in to finish, Harry. We're going in to win. [indistinct chatter] You got a pass? Got a pass? We're bloody competitors. What, all of ya? - Yeah. - No. Just him. - The boy? - Yeah. Yeah, he's a registered amateur. Got a card to prove it. He's still gotta be on my list. What's your name, boy? Pintubi. Pintubi what? Pintubi, sir. Running in the three mile, are you? Course he is. Don't often see your kind at the track, do we? No, sir. Yeah, it's simple, Sunny. They, ah... They took one look at you and saw you was a- a star. Sure, only the stars get separate facilities. Boss, I don't like these shoes. You hear that? Imported German spikes. From Germany. To make you go faster. I dunno. They feel funny. Ah, you'll get used to 'em, mate. Now... Do you remember what you have to do? Same as usual. - Beat other fellas. - Yeah, but not too big, eh? Yeah, not big. Keep your flamin' brakes on. Yeah, and for Pete's sake, - none of your stupid smiling. - No. Here it looks bad for the customers. Uh, I mean the fans. Yeah. Real amateurs don't smile. No, they frown. They look terrible. You got that? Win, not big. No smile. I guess I just don't understand white people. [cheering, shouting] - Go it, Sunny. - Go on. - Go it! - Get a move on! Hey, he's stopped. The bleedin' black idiot is standin' still! [cheering, applause] He's gonna do it! [crowd erupts] He's done it! He's done it! [announcer] And here they come at the start of the 17th mile of this 26 mile race. and it's Harry Hayes running fourth, a surprise last minute entry in this Olympic Marathon trial. Now whether he can rally... Go, Harry! Now! * Go on, Harry, drive. Drive yourself, come on! Finish it. Right through the heat. Water, Bill. Water. Bill, I want some water. We're gonna be like in Rome, Harry... hot! Unbearably hot. The heat will kill you! If you're not prepared, heat can kill. Flamin' bigots! The whole lot of them, flamin' bigots! It's okay, boss. I'm glad they picked me. I'm glad to go so far. Yeah, that's just it, Sunny. So bleedin' far... You must realize, Mr. Harcourt, this committee is not rich. Not like the Americans and the Russians. And Rome is quite a distance away. - I know geography. - Ergo... Therefore, we could only afford two in each event. And we chose experienced internationals for the track events, and Sunny, Mr. Pintubi, for less tactical. Yeah, rubbish. I beg your pardon? Er, I mean, uh... Why so, sir? Why do you have this violent objection to the Marathon? Er, because there's no interest in that freak event. Interest? Yeah, from the fans, I mean. Look, who cares about a 26 mile sweat show? Mr. Harcourt, the Marathon is the greatest Olympic race, dating back to the Greeks. Yeah, they're all dead. Could I speak? Certainly, Mr. Pintubi. I'm happy to run in the Marathon, if I get the uniform of my country. Yeah, great. I'm being done and he's playin' the bleedin' patriot. [fanfare *] Good on ya, Sunny! Good on ya! We'll see you over there! [man] How ya doin'? [indistinct chatter] [man] Hiya, Sunny. Would you like to fasten your seat belt, please, sir? Thank you. [hostess] Thank you. Mr. Philip Conley, US Olympic Committee Chairman. [applause] [Conley] My fellow Americans, you are gathered here to bring honor to our country. To show the world the power and the glory that is America. Good luck. Hooray. Comrades, Vilmo Kubitsek, our Olympic Chairman. [applause] [Kubitsek] Countrymen... We are gathered here today to bring honor to our land, and to show the world the strength and dignity of our way of life, and to wish our athletes victory! [bagpipes piping *] [reporter speaking in background] Come on. That's enough to drive anybody out of the country. [many voices overlapping] Come on. Mr. Hayes, do you think you're going to beat Vendek? Wait 'til the end of the race, you parasites. - Sir Harold. - Excuse me. You haven't seen our poles for the vaulting, have you? I know we had them when we left home. Poles? Well... [fanfare *] [cheering, applause] * Hey Calvin, how come you think they didn't make me captain? You're too humble, baby. Ha ha ha. [Scott] Ooh, ooh, look at that Polish sprinter girl. Come off it, will you? Hey now, that is true Olympic gold. * [cheering, applause] I'll tell you something, boy. The North Koreans won't march because the South Koreans are here, the Russians are waving Italian flags. the Zambians have walked out for reasons best known to themselves, and here we march, dignified and British, with our plastic macs in the land of sunshine. We're the only sane ones here. [cheering, applause] * [music stops] How long you think we're gonna have to stand here? Ah, here comes the speeches. Here, the importance is not the competition, but the confrontation. As Baron de Coubertin so eloquently put it when he revived the games in 1896: "It is not the winning, but the taking part. It is not the triumph, but the try." Don't you believe it. I now ask the president of Italy officially to open the games. I have pleasure in declaring open the Olympiad. [applause continues] I'm tellin' you man, the Reds won't let their teams mix. Calvin, this is the Olympics, not the U.N. She's got to be here somewhere. Hey, Yankee, right? Hey, Pintubi, right? - Can we join you? - Sure. Cal Wood, boy sprinter, meet Sunny Pintubi, boy Aborigine. Hi. You know, I wrote a term paper on you. Huh? He studied your civilization. In college? Yeah, although Cal doesn't show it, he actually went to college. I know about Albert Namatjira. Who? One of your martyrs... Died in jail. Hey, hey, hey. Is Scotty right, or is Scotty right? How do you say "I love you" in Polish? My mother never told me. Yeah, well, I'll know by tomorrow morning. Arrividerci. - May I help you? - [speaking Polish] You may be an Aborigine, but he's a real wild man. You got anything on tonight? On? You wanna look at Rome? Yeah. Chairman Kubitsek, we feel honored. Ah, the Sports Committee wants to tell you how much we are with you. You don't have to tell me. You've been with me all the time. You misunderstand me, Colonel. Oh, come on Vilmo. I'm may be old, but I'm not defective. Of course not, Pavel. But still, defection is the most newsworthy Olympic event. I can vouch for Colonel Vendek, sir. Who can vouch for you? Mm. Well, how about a toast? To sport? - To sport. - To sport. [clink] [flag waving] Hey Scottie. You know a couple more days I think I ought to cop this too. - Yeah I know, you never lose. - C'est moi. How did things go with that Polish sprinter girl? Calvin a gentleman doesn't talk about such things. You'd better not, she just flunked the sex test. What?! [thuds] [Announcer] At the end of a hundred and seventy-five grueling kilometers there's a breakaway... ...from the field and it's Lars Norling of Sweden that broken away. He's a desperately tired man... ... the rest of them are all in a pack but Norling cannot be overtaken. Looking exhausted he's up in the saddle and he's up the saddle and hes collapsed another cyclist has ridden into him. Norling is in a very bad way. [audience chattering] In come the medics... ... the Italians very efficient here. There's a big pile up of the cyclists as they're following in and the trail cars. Norling ashen white is being carried away by the Italians, looking dreadfully ill. [church bells ringing] Ah it's an awful way to die. Couldn't take the heat. If the idiot didn't prepare, he deserved to die. Come on, no one deserves to do, do they? He didn't live long enough to collect his medal. That's where we're different. We're trained. [crowd rioting] [crowd yelling] Ah, they're all raving mad, aren't they? Yes. It's got nothing to do with us. - Well we're here, aren't we? - We're civilized. [police sirens blaring] This is the Olympic Village scene of a black power incident this morning, which had police and city officials out in force to calm the Zambian and Polish team. Now here at poolside everything... [Mae] They feed you properly, do they? Oh yes. Seconds and thirds and all you want. Good. Yeah, but not Gomorra Sunny eh? [splash] Yeah an easy stomach for race day. How's your guy, Big Jim? Ooh bad Charlie, bad. Must be the heat or that 'Eye-tye' food. 'Eye-tye' food my foot. It's that great bundle of dough we lead on Sunny. Now look Jimmy the way we've worked it out... ... it's a sure thing. The Czech and the Pommy for the first and second, right? Yeah, no doubt. The Yank might show early foot, but Sunny'll take him in the stretch. That weren't the previous outing. Yeah but - er - he's got more experience. He's changed. Sunny'll be sure for third, won't ya Sunny? Who knows? [Laughs] We know, Sunny. We know. [people chattering] - Sunny Pintubi? - Yeah. I am Professor Jamash. Professor? And this is one of my students, Haroun Williams. - Hi. - Lovely quarters you have here. Yeah. Very lovely. - Who are you rooming with? - Who? Who is your roommate, brother Pintubi? Nobody. Isn't it considerate of them to give you a double room all to yourself? I mean the space at such a premium in Olympic Village, you are probably the only man with a room to yourself. Well... Certainly the only member of your team. Why is that brother Pintubi? I guess it's because I'm only black man. Good guess Sunny. Listen Professor the Marathon is tomorrow. Indeed it is. Tomorrow you step on the world stage. Tomorrow you will serve your people. Australia. Australians are not your people, Sunny. Well what do you call this? It's a mockery, brother Pintubi. An obscenity. Would you like the statistics on how your so-called people treat your real people? Give me the facts and figures. Listen Professor, it's getting late. I read what you are doing. I see it. - I know. You know who Albert Namatjire was? - He died in jail. - To help your real people. Tomorrow you will have a chance to help them as well. Do as other colored men have already done. Refuse to run. What? When the gun goes off, you stand still. - Refuse to run. - But that's why I came here. To run for the white man? To run for me. Attenzione! Attenzione! [Announcer speaking Italian] [runners chattering] [exhales] [Doctor] Fantastico. Donato. Veniqua. El vecchio! [speaking Italian] Formidable. - Complimenti, signore. - Multi multi complimenti. [speaking Italian] Okay. Well, coach, at least we passed the physical. ** Dr. Kravitz no one postpones the Marathon. The race itself is meant to test endurance. That is its excitement. Mr. Kaverley it is already ninety three degrees. It could be ten degrees hotter on the pavement. The heat is the same for everyone, Doctor. Mr. Kaverley the television boys have heard you may put the Marathon off till later. And... They don't like it. The Team Managers are up in arms about this heat. Is that so? [people chattering] [photographers investigating] [cameras clicking, flashing] Now then, gentlemen, thought we speak in many tongues, let it be with one voice. We could have five Norlings today. In this heat the Marathon is a fantastic risk. Postpone it till the evening. At night it will be safer. Mr. Kaverley... if I may point out, with no offense to your medical friends... we have a select time for this race on American television. If the race starts at midday we're okay... If it starts at night you can forget it. The Marathon will bring Rome to audience all over the world. To say nothing of our financial stake in the T.V. sale. We must temper all considerations to all human needs, sir. What happens if we start early evening, seven-thirty? Too late for us, Mr. Kaverley. No stations would take it. - Five thirty? - Still no good for us, sir. We shall start as scheduled, gentlemen. We can't change Olympic events for the weather. This is Rafer Johnson back here with Fred Gardener to continue our live coverage of the Olympics. As we all know, the Marathon, the final running event will be run in this severe heat. Twenty minutes before race time the temperature is still way up in the nineties and will certainly remain so during the race. Fred you had a chance to drive over the course yesterday. Is there any comment you'd like to make? Only this Rafer. Rome is the city of seven hills and this race goes up and down every one of them. Also after, driving those twenty six miles, my car collapsed. [paparazzi asking questions] Hey Scottie. Hey I've got bike, I'll be at every check point. - Good man. - You loose? No...scared! This is it Harry. All we've talked about. All we've worked for. I'll win it, Bill. That's not enough. Not enough? The two hour Marathon. - The what? - The two hour Marathon. - The impossible thing. - No Bill. No. No one can do that. Not in this heat. You can do it, Harry. In a hundred years from now they'll tell their children about it. A two hour Marathon... and we'll do it. Listen, that's nearly four and a half minutes a mile. That's right. - For twenty six miles. - Yes. That's impossible, Bill. That's why we've got to do it. Where's Hayes? Where's the Pommy? He's probably waiting in the shade. - Here relax will you, Jimmie? - Look how can I relax here... gimme a swig, will you? God I'm scared to death. Look will you cit out this scared to death talk. You'll frighten Sunny. Well our Sunny's not nervous. He's our beauty. - Here Sunny, have a drink. - No Thanks, Jim. You need it. Hmm. Yeah. Guess I do. Look Sunny, you're gonna take that third place cos of all we've given you. I know what you've given me and I'm gonna give it all back. That's what I wanted to hear! I'm gonna give you everything you ever gave me right now. Thanks Mrs. Mae. Now what the... blood hell's this? Good on yer Sunny! Good on yer! - Kovanda. - Don't say it, Colonel. In just over two hours you retire forever. No Kovanda. I want to thank you. Whatever happens it's worth it to be at the Games again. Good luck, Pavel. [engine riveting] [Announcer speaking Italian] [Multiple announcers speaking] It's just seconds now before the start of this Marathon the greatest of all distance races. I see at the starting mark... Harry Hayes, the superb English runner, who has found his form again after a series of setbacks. Then there's Scott Reynolds, America's great hope, running in his only second marathon. Then the great Pavel Vendek. These athletes will cover twenty six miles three hundred and eight five yards, and the winner will not only have to beat the athletes in the race, but will also have to beat the heat. It's boiling here this afternoon. [gun fires] [Commentator] They're off! They're off on the Marathon! Hayes sprinting into the lead to get clear of the crowd. Scott Reynolds is in Number Two position. Yoshimoto of Japan in Number Three. A very fast start, indeed. It sure is Rafer. Hayes is running more like a six miler than twenty six mile. It looks as if he's out to break the field. ** [crowd cheering] ** Harry Hayes, the great English runner, has opened up a fifteen yard lead over Scott Reynolds in the Number Two position. Yoki Yoshimoto running Number Three and Yashide, the Algerian runner is Number Four leading the pack. [crowd cheering] Two miles from Saint Peter's there in the background. Hayes has maintained the very fast pace he chose to start. Holding on about forty yards behind him is Yoshimoto of Japan. Hayes turning now with the Bridge of Saint Angelo, if anything he is increasing his lead. Still running in this intense heat, which shows no sign of letting up. ** [crowd cheering] Hayes has run the first mile in four minutes and thirty seconds and the second mile just four seconds slower, but he still looks very strong and determined. Breathing down Yoshimoto's neck are Khama of Tunisia and Svensson of Finland, just ahead of Scott Reynolds and Russia's Petrov. [horns playing] WIth nearly five miles gone coming to the Piazza Navonna Hayes is still in lead now by about one hundred yards. Behind him running together second and third are Khama of Tunisia and Svensson of Finland. Yashide of Algeria and Petro of Russia running fourth and fifth. Scott Reynolds is sixth with Yoshimoto of Japan dropped back to seventh place. And just behind him is the great Olympian, Pavel Vendek. [crowd cheering, whistling] We're high above Rome now and Harry Hayes has run every mile of the first eight miles in less than five minutes around four and a half minutes. In fact the first eight miles in less than forty minutes. And that average is particularly incredible, Rafer, when you consider that the last part of the course has been up hill and we are still climbing quite steeply. ** Following Hayes we have Petrov of the U.S.S.R. still there now with Mbani of Kenya. Behind them are Khama of Tunisia, and Svensson of Finland. Here comes Yoshimoto still well up there with Scott Reynolds, running strong now. Next right in there is Vendek. Yes Vendeck is there. He is running with Yashide of Algeria and Brandon of Great Britain. Then comes a group headed by Pintubi from Australia, who is running this race bare foot. And they are all chasing Harry Hayes. [crowd cheering] We're coming up to the half way mark now ahead of Harry Hayes. Here at thirteen miles Hayes has lengthened his lead to a length of one mile or more. Rafer we've just put on the headphones to hear that Petro running Number Two went through our last checkpoint four mins and fifty seconds behind Hayes. Go Harry. Go. If he keeps up this pace, Rafer he'll be the first athlete to complete the Marathon in two hours. And if he does he can have my medal too. [Announcer] Harry Hayes has completed the first twenty one kilometers in fifty nine minutes ten seconds. This is Adrian Metcalfe of the B.B.C. There's Petrov of Russia coming up to the table lying in second place at the moment. Now behind him Yoshimoto of Japan, Svensson of Finland. Coming now down the Appian Way there's Khama of Tunisia leading Scott Reynolds of America No. 29. [Coach] Here. Reynolds lying in sixth place at the moment. Now Reynolds leaving the table very determined, young man this heading back now towards Rome. [crowd chanting, cheering] A great roar from the crowd for Pavel Vendek Number Eight in seventh place. Pavel Vendeck off very quickly with Mboni, Number Forty, of Kenya close on his heels. Now a group of four runners including Tristan Brandon of Great Britain Number Four, Armandariz of Argentina. Elzner of West Germany, and the Aborigine runner Number Forty-three, Sunny Pintubi of Australia. Well at least he should be used to this kind of heat. Ladies and gentlemen, Hayes' time for twenty miles is just four minutes faster than the current world record for that distance. Only six miles to go now. That twenty mile record, Rafer, it's, uh, unofficial of course. That last mile was about five minutes ten seconds, but Hayes is still running well. At this point the runners are coming into the shade of these tall buildings, which will give them relief from the sun. But with only six miles to go we are at the very critical twenty mile mark and Scott Reynolds is appearing now just about half a mile behind Hayes. This boy, Reynolds, is still at college in America a runner with a tremendously strong physique wearing a sweat band. The tough little Russian, Petrov running beside him. And now we've got a group of runners that brings in little Yoshimoto of Japan, Armendirez of Argentina, Khama of Tunisia and the legendary Pavel Vendek. Behind them comes Junkersdorf of Germany and a newcomer Pintubi of Australia, who's done remarkably well to still be on contention. ** We're approaching the Trevi Fountain now and Hayes is still about half a mile ahead. It looks like the heat and humidity has finally taken its effects on this young runner. It's getting through to all the runners, Rafer. Hayes has slowed down to around five and a quarter minutes a mile. With about three and a half miles to go I don't see much chance of Hayes doing a two hour marathon now. Scott Reynolds is running second at this point with Petrov struggling to stay with him. Yashimoto and Khama come next. Then Pavel Vendeck. There's no doubt that Vendeck is the sentimental favorite of the crowd. They're giving him terrific encouragement. We're in sight of the Stadium now but the last two miles have been agony for Harry Hayes. His lead is down to just over a quarter of a mile. We're pulling over to the side of the road as vehicles are not permitted beyond this point. [crowd cheering, whistling] Oh God...no! No! No, you can't do this to me! I can run faster than you. Look! I can run faster than you! Can you run to hell... and you stay there! You're weak! You weak little runt, you're weak! Harry Hayes has gone right past the refreshment table. His coach is yelling at him. Here's Harry Hayes now with a four to five hundred yard lead, moving towards the Olympic Stadium. What's happening with the Marathon? It must be time for the Pommy to come in. And what about Sunny? Well all I can get is this damn commentary in Italian... Yap, yap, yap, yap. Coming up the Refreshment table is Scott Reynolds, running second and Pavel Vendeck third. Come on Scottie, let's go. Hayes is dying. You can still take it. Come on baby. Hayes is cracking Scottie. He's cracking, you can still take it. Come on! Go, Scottie. Scott Reynolds staggering as he reaches the table, gets there with Vendeck right on his heels. With all the liquid they must have lost in this heat these athletes surely need to replace it. Now Scott Reynolds is off, and right behind is Pavel Vendek running third. Scott Reynolds running very poorly past us now. Pavel Vendek with a mile and a quarter to go is by far the strongest of the two athletes. [heartbeat sound] [panting heavily] [panting continues] [groaning] [crowd cheering] [panting heavily] Here's Hayes is coming into the Stadium and he's in a terrible state. Hayes is coming in and he's gone. He's gone with shock. He's coming across to the officials. He's turned the wrong way. He's gone left instead of right. Oh this is terrible! Hayes is completely bemused. He's at least four hundred yards ahead and the officials are swarming around him. They've turned him back up the track. And he's moving along the track determined to stagger on. He's forcing his weary body twisted with pain after twenty-six miles desperately trying to finish this race. It's been his life's ambition. And now in the Olympic Stadium a hundred thousand people are screaming at the top of their voices forcing him and torturing him around this track. He's got two hundred and eighty yards to go now and he's still running. And the crowd roaring and it's Pavel Vendek of Czechoslovakia coming ahead into the Stadium. He must have this race! [commentators overlapping] And it's Pintubi of Australia coming to the Stadium. This is a shock! He's only just behind Vendek. And this must be the end for Hayes he can't make it now. And Vendek's heard Pintubi. He's looking around. The crowd are going mad. - He's gaining Jimmie. - Come on then. He's very had up on the back straight now. Hayes staggering across still trying to find his rhythm. Vendek's through. Hayes is down. Hayes is down. Pintubi passes him. A race between these two men now. Hayes left way behind them as Vendek comes round into the last bend fifteen yards from Pintubi but he's looking tired. And the Australian looks much fresher. Oh we've got him for third! Come on! They're running neck and neck now. Pintubi and Vendek all the way down the straight. Pintubi hits the tape. [crowd roaring] [groans] And we make Pintubi's time two hours and eleven minutes six seconds. It's an Olympic record but well outside the world record. Pavel Vendek marginally behind him. Now coming in to third place, it's the little Japanese Yoki Yoshimoto of Japan. He's collapsed as he crosses the line. Congratulations, Pavel. - I didn't win. - It doesn't matter. - You did your best. - But I didn't win. How does it feel to beat the great, great super man from Czechoslovakia? - Eh... I don't know. - What? And the terrific fight for the fourth place Khama of Tunisia just holding off the Russian, Petrov. And behind in sixth place Mboni of Kenya. And we've just heard that Scott Reynolds of America has been taken to hospital but he's not seriously injured. And this is the scene now as Hayes comes up to the line. Hayes coming up. Khama of Tunisia, Petro of Russia and Mbani of Kenya already in and now Hayes coming through into seventh place and Armendariz of Argentina just beats him on the line. Hayes is down. Hayes has collapsed for the final time. The stretcher being brought out but what a magnificent effort by this young British runner. At least he's finished this grueling heat. A tremendous performance for the British tremendous courage but from the look of him I doubt he'll even run a Marathon race again. [camera shutter clicking] Here... the importance is not the competition... but the confrontation. It is not the winning... but the taking part... It is not the triumph... but the trying...
