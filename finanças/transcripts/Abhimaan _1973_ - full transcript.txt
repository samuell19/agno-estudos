The post, which she has occupied, I wasn't worth it. - Chitra! I.. - I am telling the right thing. To tell the truth, I felt hurt after hearing the news of your marriage.. I felt as if there was nothing left between us. I feel very lonely but after hearing your wife's voice I am not at all sad. She deserve to be your wife. You don't know me, I am Chitra.. I am your husband's friend. Forgive us, we've to attend a meeting, so we'll move now. No. I obeyed your words now you've to obey mine. You cannot leave this place without having some sweets. Okay, bring some sweets. Okay, come. Mr.Rai, did you really like Uma's song? Yes, I liked it very much. She must have learnt it from some good teacher. Yes, from her father. From today I've decided that we both will sing together. - Subir! - Excuse me. It would be good if Subir don't do this big mistake. What mistake? - This, singing together. - But why? You didn't understand. Uma is more melodious than Subir. Moreover, history has taught that man is jealous of woman. And can husband accept a wife more famous than him? Don't worry about that, sir. They are already married. Within an year the time will go in bringing up the children. This will be worse. In school, I would have been 11/12 years old. One Ramesh came and gave me a cigarette to smoke. I said, no, I don't want to smoke. He started laughing and called me a fool. I didn't get agitated when he called me a fool.. His laugh agitated me. I told him to give me the cigarette. I pulled a long smoke then I started coughing very badly. I coughed till my face became red! By then the mathematics teacher arrived. Stood quietly. He started sniffing. We stood up. My face was red! He saw me, called out, Subir come here and open your mouth. He sniffied and caught me. This is the matter. Get the cane from the next room. See the situation. I am asked to get the cane for caning me. After he caned me harshly in my palm. - Stop it! - Why? I don't want to hear anymore. Why? To hell with that master. It hurt you badly? Yes! Hey! He caned me in this palm also. - Lipstick marks in your shirt. - So what? What will people think when they see it? What will they thin? So late in the night? Hello! Radha here! Remember, I met you in Haridas Congregation. Yes, I recollect. Tell me. - You have really got married? - Yes. Where is your wife? Now, she has gone to her parents' house. Why did you get married, Mr. Subir? Was it fine to break so many hearts? What to do, even I repenting about it. Telling the truth. I am just wondering how to get out of the knot? How to get a divorce? Who was that? Mine. My name is Uma. I am Mr. Subir's wife. Hey! What happened? Nothing. Let me sleep. Hey! What is the matter? Nothing. Told you, let me sleep. Soon it is going to be morning. Hey! You were all right till now. What happened suddenly? You get telephone calls from girls in the middle of the night. That is before. Now it won't happen. - Promise. It won't happen now. - Promise on me. - Sure. But one condition. - What? Every day not too many but 100/200.. Hey! Do one thing, 50%. Uma, listen. Hey! Get up. Get up! Let go of me. Please. Let go of me. Please. Sing! It was melodious. How did you like the lyrics? If the starting is nice, then the lyrics are obviously nice. Is that so! Tell me what is the meaning of these? - What the lyrics are? - What are the lyrics? Don't know? In art, the matter is expressed is not so great like what is not. This is the song of our future. How fruit comes from the flower? Still didn't understand? Okay, I'll make you understand. You are my wife and I am your husband. We love each other. The third person because of our love.. Hey!! No. But why!? Nobody will see. Daughter! Mangala, here it is. Take this. Oh God! Mangala, put our hands down. But why!? I told you to put your hands down. Someone plunders my heart in the guise of a dear one. Someone plunders my heart in the guise of a dear one. Who is he.. does something like happens in love? This is a big deceit.

On the condition that Mrs. Uma will be singing the songs. Now everything is in your hands. No, Mr. Rao. Nothing is in our hands. It all depends on her. She will never sing alone. It will be a problem then. You make her understand. Look here, Mr. Rao. Understanding is related to mind. - What do you mean? - It means that.. Its all related to the heart. She has taken a vow that, she will never sing alone. No! No! Don't worry, Mr. Rao. Uma will sing. No, I will not sing. Never. Uma! Please listen to me. Tell me, why you won't sing? - I won't sing alone. - But why? You only said that we'd sing together and live together. But sometime you talk like granny and not like Uma. That means I can never, sing a solo songs. You sing, I won't. Again, the same thing. Is there any difference between you and me? Aren't we one after the marriage? See, if you sing, it means I am singing and.. If I sing, it means you are singing. Now all my happiness is with you only. Now all my happiness is with you only. Dying for you is what life is all about. Now all my happiness is with you only. Understood? It should be like this only. What's going on, Chandru? For Bhabhi's award, the place, understood, right? Understood? Since the time this heart went crazy for you. Since the time this heart went crazy for you. Then whatever may the world say to me. People may say whatever they may wish to. Now all my happiness is with you only. In your love, I've become defamed till far. In your love, I've become defamed till far. With you, my dear, even I've become famous. Just see, where my own absence takes me. Now all my happiness is with you only. Greetings! How are you? Autograph please. Pen. Take this. - Your name? - Asha. Asha! Hey! Uma madam has come. Wake up. See brother Chandru is waiting for you. Get up! Get up! - Has Chandru come? - Yes. Send the tea there itself. Chandru, did you ward off the trouble? Which one, the income taxes? I've filed the returns. But I'm not getting 2-3 certificates. - Why? - Because I have entered last years amount this year. How will that help? This is a white lie! This is a black market. Only white lies will work here. Congratulations, sister. Fortunately, 4 of your songs are in the “Binaca” charts. After hearing such good news, at least give a binaca smile. Chandru brother, from today, never again shall I sing. What does it mean? Means I won't sing from today. And what'll happen to the contracts we've signed? Whatever happens, I've decided. And what about those who've prepared for the recording? No problem will overcome you. I would be the one getting thrashed. Won't it look bad? Sister thinks that getting thrashed feels pleasant. Even I think so. Ok, then I won't sing, once the current commitments are over. What's the matter hubby dear? Have you fought with her? - No! - Swear on me. No, you will swear falsely on my name. Don't swear on me, swear on the 7 notes. I mean the 3.5 notes. Did you eat grass in the morning? Why should I fight with her? This means that sister isn't feeling well. Such a soft spoken and tender girl, we're fools man.. We dumped so many responsibilities on her.. As soon as she came. Recordings are taking place, rehearsals are taking place.. Upon this the Award ceremonies and the functions. No way. I will stop all this. At least for 2 months, all stopped. Yes, Hiranandani? What's the matter? Enjoying yourself? Subir kumar? He's sitting here. He's fine. Says hello to you. Sister? Hello to her also? Ok, sir. Hello, hello. - Have to do a program? - No, no. refuse it, pal. I won't do any programs now. It's not for you, pal. It's for sister. Yes, Hirananadani. I'll try to arrange it. No, no. it won't do. It's straight from Rs.2000 - 5000. I won't reduce a single pie. This is the final deal. What? You're ready to pay Rs.5000? Okay. Alright. This is miraculous, pal. This Hiranandani turned out to be a diamond. I quoted Rs.5000, to refuse him. But he accepted it. Meaning, he's ready to pay Rs.1000 more than your price. What's wrong? The money will be in the same house. Oh God, I think the people in our country.. Do nothing other than writing letters. Either they keep blabbering. Talking, talking, talking. Or they write letters. Keep write. What are you blabbering? If this goes on, I'll be jabbering. Sister has really bored me. Is this a fan mail? A man fails! Who will answer such letters? My father? Moreover, there's the dates problem.. The rehearsal arrangements, the recordings. You do one thing. Appoint another secretary for yourself. Yes, pal. Staying among stars, I've become a star secretary. Someone else will take care of my work. You manage Uma's work. Look here, I'm your friend not your wife. I mean after all even friends are human. No. I... See, Biru, I will decide what I'll do and what I'll not. Not you. I'm going. I've to go with sister for the rehearsal.. Even you've a recording in the afternoon. Come by yourself. Don't forget. I'll join you later. Hello. Chandru isn't here. I'm Subir. Tell me. That's fine, but nowadays, I've increased my rates. Rs.6000. If it's too much, then let it be so. What can Chandru do about this, Mr. Rao. I'm the one who'll sing. Not Chandru. As you wish. Sweetheart, this Bindiya will take away your sleep! This killing Bindiya on your forehead! Master, how is the tune. Mr. Chandru, listen to it. No need to listen. It should be a hit. I've done my best. I know that you'll popularize the songs through letters. - But it should be a hit from my point of view also. - It is a hit. Mr. Chandru, just a minute. He is asking for Rs. 6000. - When did you call? - Sometime back. Really? Listen, how come you're here today? I was just walking, not knowing where to go. Suddenly when I opened my eyes, I found myself here. Oh! So wandering around, you reached here. Come. Maria! - Hello, is sir there? - No, he went out a long time back. Stop it, Chitra. Please stop it. It's the same voice again. I'm tired of listening to it. Life has become a bore now. What happened, Subir? Have you heard Uma, singing? Yes, I heard. She is one in a million.. She sings well, isn't it? Very well. How's she? Quite fine. No, Chandru brother. I don't know. Where could he have gone? Look here, Subir. I'm your friend. I don't expect anything other than friendship from you. Tell me please. Nothing, Chitra. Nothing. I just know one thing. Earlier, I was alone. Now I am all alone. Everyone of us are alone, Subir. Yes, Chitra. We're all alone. All alone. This loneliness, this isolation, we create it ourselves. Small bickering, egoistic attitude. Now I've begun liking this loneliness. Like it? Yes. When you are lonely, this world seems a better place. Chitra, don't you sometimes feel that life is strange? Life. Please don't drink anymore. Whatever it maybe, I know you. But Subir, whatever has happened, try and bear it. Bear it? You're talking like the Chandramukhi of Devdas. Who, damn it, drinks for bearing.. I drink so that I don't remain in my senses. Salutations, sir. - What happened? - Nothing. Chitra madam has said that Subir sir's car shall be sent tomorrow. Okay. Subir. Eh, Subir! Vishnu, go from here. Why didn't you come for the recording yesterday? I wasn't well. You weren't well. That's why you got drunk. That too at Chitra's place. Trying to break the stars from the sky. Which fool shall be willing to pay you Rs.6000, all of a sudden? Whether I charge Rs.6000 or Rs.10000, its my business understand. Do I owe an answer? You don't need to justify yourself. I know what is perturbing you. You've read in the books.. That men are higher placed than woman. That's it. You aren't able to tolerate sister's progress. Chandru! You're crossing the limits. What limits!? Don't I know? Sister is getting Rs.5000 so you want more than her. Stop your nonsense. Don't forget that this is my house. Your house!? Yes. I had forgotten, that this is your house. Thank you for reminding, Subir. - Where are you going, brother? - Nowhere. Listen. What happened? Hello. Who is it? Subir? How are you? I'm fine. I'm giving you good news. Your wife Uma has been chosen to be honored.. In our music festival. Give this news to Uma. - Hello! Subir! - Yes? This program of ours will be broadcast in all India radio. I'm troubling you a little but please send.. A small life sketch of Uma by tomorrow. - Yes, sure. - Thank you. Listen. What happened to Chandru brother? What happened? I don't know. It seems someone.. You didn't tell him anything. Did you? No. Then what happened? Please tell me. I'm sure that you know. I told you I don't know. Am I supposed to know everything.. That happens to everybody in this house? Without the sweetheart.. Without the sweetheart.. The flute doesn't sing. Without the sweetheart.. The flute doesn't sing. The way the sweetheart got annoyed.. As if the music got annoyed from my life. The way the sweetheart got annoyed.. As if the music got annoyed from my life. When I sing.. if feels as if all the songs of my heart aren't true. The way he got angry at me! The way he got angry at me! Without the sweetheart.. Without the sweetheart.. The flute doesn't sing. Without the sweetheart.. The flute doesn't sing. Without you my heart is lonely. Without you my heart is lonely. All the desires and longings have extinguished. The days are lonely so are the nights. Without the sweetheart.. Without the sweetheart.. The flute doesn't sing. Without the sweetheart.. The flute doesn't sing. Vishnu brother, where's sir? Sir, hasn't come back yet, sister. I will come soon. Madam, someone has come to meet you. Who is it? I don't know. Haven't seen her before. Okay. Let's go. Excuse me, you!? Greetings! I've come to take him. How did you come to know that Subir is here? I know. Why did you take the trouble to come here? You could have called me up. I would have sent him. Nowadays, he stays a little sad, that's why I came to take him. Nowadays, even I'm noticing that Subir stays a little sad. Do you know why? Forgive me, but I don't want to discuss about it. I've understood. Sit down. Shall I ask you something? Do you feel that I've misled Subir.. No, no, Chitra. The one who loves, he never.. You!? Why've you come here? Why've you come here? I've come to take you. Why? Am I a kid? Can't I come by myself? Subir! It's too late. Go home. - Shall I serve the food? - No. I'm not feeling hungry. Why? Do I have to reply to all your “whys”? Reply? Have I ever asked you for a reply? Give me an answer for that. What's the reason behind coming to Chitra's house to take me? You won't understand. I won't understand? Ok, then make me understand. Will you understand if I try to? Look here, Uma. Stop answering in riddles. Talk clearly. Nowadays you feel a lot lonely. That's why I have decided to stop singing. What's the relation between my loneliness and your singing? I don't want you to be troubled because of me. Because of you? You think that I'm jealous of your name and wealth? I don't know. You know better. Ok, sacrifice eh? I want to stay with you. No need. I don't want anyone to live with me. Understand? You don't need me? Then I have no right to live here. I don't know. You know it. You! Uma! When did you come? My blessings are with you, dear. - Where's Biru? - He didn't come. Didn't come? You came alone? What happened? Tell me? What happened? Don't cry, dear. What happened? No. Uma did the wrong thing. Husband and wife have this sort of bickering. Whatever it is. She shouldn't have come without informing him. - What sort of behavior is this? - Please don't be angry. Ok, she made a mistake. But Biru is also not a kid. He shouldn't have told anything to Uma under such conditions. Such conditions!? What conditions!? You're going to be a grandpa very soon. Bhiru doesn't know it too. I'll write a letter. He'll come running. Now go and sleep. Mother, I made a mistake. I'll return tomorrow. No. the first child should be born in your mother's house. You do one thing. Write a letter to Biru and tell him everything. And don't worry about anything. You should always remain happy when in such a condition. Chandru brother, greetings. I'm not your sister in law anymore. Just your sister. I wrote him 2 letters. But he didn't reply. I came without telling him. Maybe that's why he's angry with me. How's he? Has he started singing or not? I was the one to remove music from his life. Now I've just one dream, to make him sing. Big mother isn't letting me go under any circumstance. You must've understood the reason. Didn't understand? You're going to become an uncle soon. Tell him too. I'm feeling shy to write it to him. Don't forget. His responsibility is yours. It's your little sister's request. Your little sister, Uma. - Hey Vishnu. - Yes, sir. Please attend call. Hello. - Vishnu! - Chandru, brother. Why did you keep the phone down? It seems everyone has become careless since I left. C'mon. Make a hot cup of tea for me. I'll be back in a moment, Chandru brother. Please move your hand. You are looking at me as if you don't know me. How are you? I'll tell all that later. But first, treat me to some sweets. - I've brought some really good news. - What? I'm going to become an uncle(chacha). No sorry, uncle.(mama). - Uncle!? - Yes. Now whether uncle or aunty, that'll be known.. Only when the child is born. I mean whether nephew or niece. Who's the mother? - C'mon, pal. Uma sister. - Really!? How did you come to know? She wrote a letter to me and made me her brother. How nice it would be when there's a kid.. Roaming around in our home. A little kid plays marbles at our doorstep. A little kid plays marbles at our doorstep. C'mon. now let's go. - Where? - To the village! No, Chandru. I won't go. What do you mean? She left the house. She has to come back on her own. Moreover, she didn't write the letter to me. The one to whom she has written should go. You also, man! Sorry, I was about to abuse you like in earlier times. You donkey, which girl would write to her husband that.. She is no more a girl and that she is going to be a mother? Don't act stupid. Come on get ready. No, Chandru. I won't go. You may go if you want. This night of our union.. Will blossom a new flower. That is why your eyes are twinkling.. Just see. Hey, who are you, child? I'm my mother's son. Mother's son!? What's your father's name? Subir Kumar. - And your mother? - Uma Devi. Don't touch me. Why, dear? You hurt my mother. She died a sad death. No. no. UMA! What are you doing in the sun? Get ready. We have to go to the hospital. Mother, I've prepared a sweet for you. You eat it. In the meantime, I'll go and get ready. Don't run in such a state. How many times have I told you? Brother, where are you going so early in the morning? Welcome, sister. I was going to the market. Then give us the hospital card before leaving. Hospital, so early? Any problem? No, brother. It's the first pregnancy. We should be a little careful. Go and get the card. Uma. Hurry up! Uma. Chandru brother! This is what is called a sister's love. You came to know that I'm hungry. Give it. Wow! Go bring another plate. Give this and then go. You're Durga aunty, isn't it? - Yes. - Greetings! God bless you. Recognize me. You're Biru's Chandru. Great aunty. Another greeting. God bless you. Brother, this is Biru's friend Chandru. - Uncle!? Greetings. - God bless you. - Son, how's Subir? - He's fine. Sister, where's Uma? Shall bring something? Now don't worry. Go and attend to your job. I will handle everything. Okay. I'll come. - Okay. - Sure. He's going to the market. To get some sweets for me. isn't it? He's a saint. Comes to know of everything. Aunty, what about my staying and eating arrangements? I can stay anywhere but the food can't be compromised. I've this bad habit. I need to eat sweets after eating spicy foods. Then again spicy foods after sweets and then again some spice. Ok. Ok. Everything will be done. But tell me, why didn't Subir come? He? He got ready on listening to the news. I asked him, what would happen to the recording? He said to hell with the recording. I told him that they will sue you, there'll be losses worth lakhs. I requested him a lot, begged him and then only he agreed. So I came instead. Uma, you get ready and come to my place. We'll go to the hospital from there. I'll send Parvati, she'll bring Chandru's luggage home. Brother, he refused to come isn't it? - No, meaning.. - I've understood everything. When you talked more than needed to console everyone. It's not like that, Uma. You know how adamant he is. I know everything. He'll never forgive me. Uma, let the child come. Everything will be alright. Everyone says the same thing. Let the child come and all the wealth of the world will come! - What happened, doctor? - Uma? No, Uma is fine. But Sadanand, sir I'm sorry I couldn't save the child. This is my 3rd and last letter to you. I can't bear to see Uma in this condition. She has turned into a stone. I've written to you repeatedly asking you to take her home. Forget coming here. You didn't even reply to any of the letters. You didn't reply to any of Durga aunt's letters!? What reply could I've given? There's just one reply. Go and meet Uma now itself. No, Chandru. With what face shall I go? I won't be able to go there. You won't be able to go!? After listening to all this? Are you a human or what? No, he's no more a human. Can a human behave like this? - Aunty! - Your aunt's dead for you. - Aunty, come in. freshen up first. - No, Chandru. I won't even drink water in this house. I've just come to say that, I used to feel proud about him.. But now I feel ashamed of him. Can a man stoop to such lows? Tell him to go and see her. That sweet little girl, what has happened to her! It would've been better for Uma to have died. Chandru, I've come to pray in the temple. I've come to request him to give.. Solace to Uma or to call her to Himself. The taxi is waiting outside. Will you see me off, dear? Of course aunt. Come. What do you think about so much, dear? I don't like it. C'mon. Come with me. C'mon. Come and sit there. Come. Come. Come and sit there. Do you remember, once I had told you in Jaunpuri raga about.. Dhiranayaka and Adhirnayaka? Please recite it. Hey Subir! You've come, dear. I was thinking about you. Bless you. Everything will be fine. Everything will be alright, now that you've come. Come sit. I'll call her. Uma! Uma! Subir has come. Subir. Go and talk to him. I'll go get some sweets. Go. Hurry up! How are you? Listen my dear. - Are you fine? - Yes. How are you? Uma, take this suitcase inside. Did you see for yourself, what has happened to her? I've shown her to all the doctors here. Now take her to the city and show her to some good doctor. You've married her with fire as a witness. It's your responsibility. I don't want to say anything more. Uma. Angry with me? I've hurt you a lot, isn't it? Forgive me, Uma. Forgive me. This is my story, doctor Mhatre. That's it. After this Uma has turned into a stone. The problem is that these patients don't take care of their health. They may or may not take their medicines. Doctor, will electric shocks.. No, no. She isn't mad. She is just a victim of a shock. We've to somehow make her laugh or cry. I've tried a lot, doctor. Don't lose heart. Keep trying. We don't know when and for what she may laugh or cry. The problem is that she doesn't want to listen to anything. Whenever we try to say anything. She just gets up and leaves. She'll do such things. You said just now, that she sleeps.. Downstairs, doesn't want to come upstairs. Forget talking, she doesn't even tolerate music. The reason is clear. She wants to forget her past. She wants to move away from it. We've to remake her life from the point from where it split. That's the only way to give her a new life. What're you doing, Uma? Uma, tell me. what did I get from your suitcase? What did you get? These small, cute little socks! Who's is it? Munna's. She made it for him. But our fate, that God didn't give him a chance to wear it. Yes. Else he would've been 4 months old now. And he would've started walking in a few more months. Uma's lap would've been filled. And also the house's happiness. Ok, Uma. What should we do with it? Throw them away. Take this, Uma. Take it. What a sweet and spicy thing. Like a movie. Comedy in romance, romance in comedy. Even foreigners come over here to eat this. I can't bear it anymore, Chandru. I just can't bear it. Don't lose heart, pal. Think about this, she hadn't left home all these days. At least she came here today. It's all useless, Chandru. Useless. Uma has turned into a stone. All because of me. If you really feel so, that you've spoilt her life. Then it's your duty to restore it. Rai sir, we've come to you so that you can show us a way. Subir, both you and Uma have the same characteristic. That is nothing but music. Music brought you together. Music is your nuptial cord. That's why the solution to your problem is music. You've to sing, Subir. No, Rai sir. Music is my enemy. Singing is the reason for all this. No, Subir. It's not because of singing. But because of not singing. I know that, your decision to stop singing was.. A great blow to Uma daughter. Yes, Subir. Uma had written the same thing to me in her letter. Your not singing was killing her. She won't forgive herself unless you sing. Subir, if you want Uma to recover.. Then you've to bring music back into your life. You've to sing. When, where and how, leave it to me. Come, dear. Sit. Sit. Sit Uma. Please sit, Chandru. Thank you. Here Uma, see. Dear brothers and sisters, the silver jubilee celebrations of.. 'Surjhankar', begins now. First I thank you all for your cooperation. Firstly, we are starting our program with a artiste who.. For a long time, had disappeared into loneliness. His name is Subir kumar. Respecterd Mr. Brajeshwar Rai and friends. The respect and honor that you've given me.. I don't know whether I deserve it. The song which I am going to sing today.. Isn't just a song but a dream.. Which me and my wife had seen together. Unfortunately, that dream was shattered. This night of our union.. This night of our union.. Will blossom a new flower. Will blossom a new flower. That is why your eyes are twinkling.. Just see. Just see. This night of our union.. Uma. Uma. Sit down.. be quiet. I made a mistake.. That I asked Subir to sing this song on his own. Actually this is a song is not only of Subir Kumar.. But a dream of him and his wife. We are glad that she is present here. I request her to sing along as well. - Come Uma. - Didn't you write that Subir will have to sing again? Don't you want to witness that auspicious day? Yes daughter, you will have to sing. I'm like your father. It is my order. Get up. Get up. This night of our union.. This night of our union.. Will blossom a new flower. Will blossom a new flower. That is why your eyes are twinkling.. Just see. Just see. This night of our union.. A small child will blossom in our house.. And the bare arms will get adorned by his presence. A small child will blossom in our house.. And the bare arms will get adorned by his presence. Just like the moon plays in the clouds he will play in your lap. The moonlight will sing. The moonlight will sing. That's why your eyes are twinkling, just see. - Just see. - Just see. This night of our union.. Holding you in many hands.. I will meet the intoxicating night. Holding you in many hands.. I will meet the intoxicating night. By raising the unheard of heartbeat.. I will fill your heart, my sweetheart. With a new trait.. it will make me crave. That is why your eyes are twinkling.. Just see. - Just see. - Just see. This night of our union.. Will blossom a new flower. Will blossom a new flower. That is why your eyes are twinkling.. Just see. - Just see. - Just see. This night of our union..
