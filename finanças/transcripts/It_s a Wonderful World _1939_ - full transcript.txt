- Big wedding? - Great. Where did you spend the day? In bed. - The boyfriend ferment? - Provisionally. Does this marriage end your contract with Heyward? No, his mistress remains. Listen, are you going to waste your youth pulling a drunk out of bars? It is unworthy even for a private detective. For a hundred dollars a week, nothing is unworthy. Don't tell me he's taking you on his honeymoon! Oh no, it will unravel. I've been following him for a year. Have you seen this? Dame. Damn fat! The dancer drags Heyward to justice. Demand damages for your broken dreams. I know that girl. It is a poison. What are you going to do? I have several ideas. - Do you want some advice? - Do not. These things are really crap. I like it. The Spanish dancer often brings bad luck. I do not laugh, you risk your skin to corner her, And all this for what? for $ 100 a week. Ok, greed will lose you. Look at 'Cap', a year ago, I was trying to have just enough to live as a demonstrator of electric belts in a warehouse. And since then I have progressed. Willie the cub is my benefactor, and I get him out of trouble as long as he keeps paying me. Good morning boss. You have a phone call, Mr. Johnson. I have a fine job for you Streeter tonight, in Harlem. It's going to turn black. Good, commander. Yes? Guy Johnson to the apparatus. Yes, Gus. What happen? Your boss is still hanging around. Yes, he had a good one. No, he stumbled away. Ok, I'll bring the hunting dogs. Have you done it again? He hasn't been married for 24 hours and already spends his afternoons out! Do you know where it went? He said nothing, He zigzagged away. He stayed only fifteen minutes. - Did you drink a lot? - Liters. Goodnight. Has Mr. Heyward been hanging around here? If he hit me and called me around Then I said to him: I am his friend. He replied that the idiots would enjoy this afternoon. He wanted to hit me again! And I put him in a taxi. - Where I've been? - To the Fairhaven hotel. "To the Fairhaven Hotel?" - Yes. Quick, to the Fairhaven Hotel! I want to see Ms. Gonzales. Ask that bitch if she's lonely. I want to see her alone. Okay? Bien, Sr. Heyward. Answer! Answer! Tell me? Ms. Gonzales? Mr. Heyward says if you are alone. Yes, she says that she is alone. I like it that way. To number 36, boy. Fast. Please, I beg you! What are you going to do? Please let me go! Shut! Open the door when I knock. Come on, open up! Hello Hello?. She's in her room. He must have forgotten to hang up. Hello Hello? OMG!. There are shots! Someone has shot. What are you doing here? - Where did you get this weapon? - That weapon? The one in his hand! What's that? Half a coin of ... Come on, help me. You guys bother me! I'm looking for Dolores! Where is that bitch? She's dead! - Did you kill her? - Kill who? Oh come back to earth , wake up at once! Upon entering everything went out. - He killed her? - No, it was a trap. Do not discuss this with anyone. It's all good, I'm a detective, okay? - Someone comes. - Is there no other way out? Yes, in the bedroom, the fire escape. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Willie Heyward wanted for murder on his honeymoon Heyward stands up the detective who wanted to deliver him Police question Heyward's wife I understand your pain, Mrs. Heyward, but I need to ask you some more questions. I will answer all your questions. I do not have anything to hide. I love Willie. I love my life. Perfect. Do you know if Willie wanted to see Miss Gonzales? That's normal! She wanted to destroy her happiness. I told him that I didn't care, that my love had no limits. Tell me, will you get a divorce if you are caught? Oh no, no, never. I will be with him until the end. Do not move! Now excuse me I would like to retire. We support you, Mrs. Heyward. Thanks. - I'm going to retire. - Yes ma'am. Good afternoon my love. Good afternoon, honey. My love. Isn't it too intrusive? No, everything went well. - Do you want a drink? - Do not. Will you love me more when I'm a widow with 10 million? This is not over yet. They won't stop until Willie is sentenced to death. I guess so. - What happen? - Nothing. Any problem? Did you leave your footprints? I left something else. The fact that? Your half coin that I had to take to repair. She had to catch it when it fell on me. We may not get it back. And the other half of the piece? Calm down, she's buried with the one who wore her. - Your husband's name was Ned Brown? - Yes He died in Australia. Yes, on a tour. The doctor wrote to me from Melbourne. - You are a stupid. - So you think? Listen to this! I ran into him at Variety magazine. Ned Brown, English actor, He joined the Chambers company that will be on tour this summer. Mr. Brown arrived from Australia last week. Â¿Australia? That's impossible! I'm scared. What are we going to do? I do not know. If you have the other half of the coin, you can put us in a bind. If we allow it. - Are you going to allow it? - Do not. When you go hunting for millions, you have to go all the way. Oh, it's you! - He is okay? - No, it's impossible to sleep. - The remorse? - No, I'm dizzy I'm starting to get nervous. We all are. We have to get out of here, you know I didn't do anything. Just look at me, right? You are very handsome, but I am not interested. Get dressed. - Where we go? - Go for a walk. - Where to? - To the police. You can't betray me! You have to find the culprit. That's impossible. How? Some guy killed her and put the gun in my hand. I heard. I've been working for you for 15 days , without success. You are going to have to testify! Find who owns the half coin. I already risked too much! I'll pay you $ 50,000 if you inquire about that test! - Are you guilty? - Of course not. Don't yell! I'll give you $ 100,000 if you find the culprit. 100,000? Put it in writing. Done! Rest assured, it is legal. I am a lawyer in my spare time. There is a small possibility. $ 100,000 ... A mirage. What possibility? Let the half coin belong to your wife. They lived? What are you talking about? Or from one of your friends. You are delirious. She Loves Me. Specially roasted in an electric chair and with his millions to his name. You've gone mad! If the coup is successful, you will be executed, And who benefits from it? Your lady. This is my only clue. Stay here, I'll ask again. Don't leave here before ... Good evening, Commodore. Two clandestines. - Did I hit him? - Later. Calm down, Captain Kidd. Handcuff them.

And the prisoner here and now increases to 6. Let me think... You let me? I see those six. - I pass. - I also. I see. I have no game. Very good. I am a fortune teller. Discover your cards! You've lost your mind? Bet 6 with this? We are already 5 points behind, Poor idiot! I could have been wrong. Don't you think you've lost your mind, Mr. Johnson? Do not complain! It's their pasta as much as yours. Lets go play. You think we should send him to the chair! Don't be so angry. Do you want to see your late husband at the Saugerties Theater on Wednesday? Signed, half a coin. - What are you laughing at? - Guess it! We go 5 points below. Leave it at once! It will take 10 years to recover from this blow, Mr. Johnson! My head is spinning. I'm going to stretch my legs. Will you accompany me, sergeant? Why not. Wants the company of a gentleman. Come back soon I want to remake myself. I'm sorry but I was drowning, locked in that compartment. You're going to have to get used to being locked up. Prisoners are required to live in cells. - Behind bars. - It has fire? You are very angry at Miller. He did it on purpose, right? I won it in a raffle. I have an idea. Suppose we go back and when you restart the game you announce something. You just have to say, you guessed it. And we're going 50 percent. That tells me? 50 percent, good for me! Let's go outside! Get out! Go! Come on! Hey, hey, hey, come on, grab the hat, come on!

If you want to talk about your crimes, If it can relieve you, I am willing to listen to you. Listen stupid! I have committed crimes but I am not a criminal. Everyone has their own point of view. I can even tell you the truth. I am a private detective. Sorry. Private detective? Seriously? Yes really! I would never have imagined it! I'm looking for a killer. - I see! - Yes. Is the man you jumped off the train with, the one you were taking to jail? No, he was taking me. - Why are you a detective? - Yes. Do they put detectives in jail? Only the best. Come on, it wouldn't be better if you told me the truth. It's the truth, I'm a detective. And my client is going to die knowing he is innocent. I was convicted of hiding him while I was investigating the case. I jumped off the train because I discovered a clue about this case. I have to corner a woman. I love stories for children. I'll leave her out in the open as soon as I get a car. I swear by my eyes ... Shut up, shut up! I'm going to have a dream. Me too if you don't mind. - She's tired? - Yes, I fall asleep. - What a beautiful bracelet! - Yes it is. - Yes, here's another one. - Oh no, no, let me go! Don't make me throw it on the ground! You cannot do that. Now you can do whatever you want. Don't move too much. How do you dare... What do you think? It is even more annoying for me than for you. You are the most disgusting being I have ever met. I'm wondering the same. I warn you, I am a very light sleeper . Go. I did not wake up. Let's go on the road. When was it released? Oh, a few hours ago. It was simple, the key was in his pocket. I call the Police? You're slow in the morning, Mr. Johnson. I would not stand here waiting if it were the case. Breakfast awaits you on the terrace. No grapefruit? This will not happen anymore. Did we steal it? You are a detective! - Do you want them hot? - Yes. You are in the newspapers, Mr. Johnson! Inmate wanted by police after he jumped off the train Did you play extreme defense at the national level? Yes. I blame myself for not believing you were a detective. He realizes? 200 police bikers! I could have shown what a psychologist I am. He doesn't look like a criminal but it could have been a forger. I'm on page three. Three. It is discreet, but not bad. - Is it you, then? - Yes, it's me. The photo is horrible! And that hat is ridiculous! I always stuff myself with hot dogs before a feast, especially from a poetry banquet. That is why we met. Â¿Edwina, eh? Recover! Don't be a fan. Are you a poet? Sometimes we are born under a bad star. - What does it mean? - Oh, nothing, nothing. - Nothing. - Did you read my poems? No, no, the opportunity never presented itself . - Is he too manly for it? - Yes. I wrote a poem last night while you were sleeping. Oh yeah? Good, so you can keep it! He talks, somehow.

If it happens unfortunately they will know my poems. As happened to Lord Byron. I should have stayed on the train! I'm not of that opinion. They need you at Saugerties. Come on, big man, move on! Â¡Oh, oh, mi...! Â¡Oh! They follow us? Wait! I will take a look. The ferry leaves at noon. The ferry leaves every hour on the hour. Free way. When does the ferry leave? I do not know.

First performance, tonight Is there someone at home? Oh, you are Cyril Hemingway! Â¿Madame Chambers? Oh Cyril, I am delighted that you have made up your mind. I recognized it immediately, Mrs. Johnson. I write for The New York Times Madame Chambers, it is very kind of you. It does not matter. One of the actors has the flu. It is a small role, but you will know it by tonight. He's a soldier from the south. Mr. Hemingway is originally from the South. From Virginia, right? Â¡Ah!, Alabama. It's perfect if you want to read me a couple of sentences. I would be delighted to read them for you. Perfect. Perfect. Poor Mr. Isaac, I could never master the accent of a Mississippi man. - De Alabama. - Â¡Oh, Alabama. They are only a few lines but they are essential. Please excuse me, I am going to take some photos for my article. - You are very kind! - Thanks. Goodbye, Cyril. Sit down. I will comment on it. The scene takes place in a shelter and you are a lieutenant from Louisiana. Oh, from Alabama! Here. It has. - Do you have the paper? - Dressing room No. 3. Here. It is wonderful! Do not worry. No one is going to recognize me. I want to apologize. Because of last night? It was not my fault. When you love someone, you imagine that it is the best. You are not that bad. I don't apologize for last night. You acted foolish. Oh I'm sorry! I thought you were like everyone else. - How? - Moron. I often say: It is impossible that they are all stupid and not us. But I had that impression until I found him. Thanks. You have changed my view of women. I thought they had no head. And that's what you have best. I have a brain, right? Yes, you are some kind of magician. Well, you haven't seen anything yet! I'm going to see all the actors to interview them. On marital situations. We'll have a clue as soon as it's dark. Well, I have to learn my role now. Do you know how to act? I learn fast! Among magicians, we understand each other! Dice. I was mee ... I was a mechanic ... I was a locomotive mechanic in the State ... in the State of Louisiana. Three accidents in my division ... divi ..., division. Greetings, Flash Gordon. Where is Ming? I'm glad to see you. I would like to say the same. Come in and relax. Thanks. - Have you read the newspaper? - I have no time. We are looking for you. But that doesn't matter to you. I am aware. Did they follow you? No idea, I came making circles. It has been hard to find the address. You truly are a lynx! Wow, Sherlock, attend the delivery. Did you jump off a train and disappear to become an actor? No, it's a cover. The prosecutor will ask for the maximum when he finds you. It will sentence you to at least 15 years. Come on, I hear you. Do not interrupt me. I was sitting on the train going to jail, when suddenly something caught my attention. How exiting! Do you remember the half coin that was found on the victim? Yes, I remember. I've always thought that there would be another mean. Like soulmates shared between two lovers. And I read this on the train. I thought half a coin was an actor here. And I said to myself, first of all: Half a coin is blackmailing his ex-wife, Mrs. Heyward. Second: Mrs. Heyward has an accomplice who is going to kill him. And third: it had to be in the same place. Who is that guy nicknamed half a coin? That is what we have to find out. Well partner In 25 years in the business, I have never seen anything so ridiculous. I am going to make a suggestion and it is very serious. I call the police saying you're crazy and you don't know your name or where you are. And you see things climbing the wall! We put ourselves in the hands of a psychiatrist who will admit you. And in a couple of years, you get out. It's probably the police, take it seriously! Â¡House! Between. Madame Chambers wishes to rehearse the scene with the suit on. I'll be in five minutes. I have to get dressed. Is there a classy hotel in this city? The Seneca hotel, why? Okay, call then. And ask if Mrs. Heyward has reserved a room. If not, I will follow your advice. Hand me over to the Seneca Hotel, please. You will have booked with your name, you will not take any risk. The Seneca hotel? Is Mrs. Vivian Heyward staying there? And good? Oh I see! When do you expect it? For dinner, huh? I see. No, I won't call her again. Do you believe me? You said it. We should look for "half a coin." Do you have any idea? They are within the troop. It's one of them, huh? Yes, you have to help us. You have to keep it alive. I have to call the major, wait for my report. See you later. I want to make a call to the PCV. Mr. Streeter to the apparatus. Put me on Major Willoughby in New York. I remain waiting. Hello, Major? I heard. I found Guy Johnson. I must be brief. He has been hired as an actor ... "Â¡Oh, capitÃ¡n", vamos. "Captain Flagg, I'm bleeding!" Come on. AcÃ©rquese. "Oh, chap ...!" Take my arm. Go. Kneel down, kneel down. It's okay. "Oh Captain Flagg, I'm bleeding! "I'm bleeding! And you stay there until the curtain falls. That's it, guys. The sound effects. It's okay. The sound effects. Wonderful! Wonderful! Okay guys. Are there many shots in this play? Just these, I didn't see anything louder since Ben Hur. I'm done. What happen? - What's up, come on? - Can I speak to you? Come on hurry up. What happens? - I did a terrible thing. - What what? I think I have killed someone. - I assure! - To who? To a policeman. Calm down, and explain yourself. I was forced. He was calling for backup ... With what weapon? I do not know, with a kind of mallet, a slightly strange tool. - Did you hit him on the head? - Yes. Are you sure he's dead? Yes, I don't think he's breathing. It's okay. Well, calm down. I hit his head and gagged him but I don't think it was necessary. Was dead. Come on, start over, let's see! Let's get down to business! It's okay. Me... When he said that he found you I lost my mind, I didn't know what I was doing. Keep calm. Where is the body? In your dressing room, under a blanket. Did you leave it in my dressing room? That's where I found it. Was he there ... in my dressing room? Yes, he was making a phone call. Was he a short bald man ? - Bald in a blue suit? - Do you know him? Reply! Because, why? Did you call a major? Yes, Major ... oh , I've forgotten the name. Oh, don't be mad, Guy. I love you so. I was wrong. But I did it for you. - Did you do it for me? - Yes. What's going on? - You hit Streeter, you idiot! - Streeter? He came to help me. Oh I'm going to pass out! You can't pass out! Come on, wake up! - Where is it? - There. - Where? - There. Oh my gosh, he's gone! - Was he tied up? - Yes. What a chump! Where did you leave it? Under that blanket! Someone had to find it. - Its alive! - Shut! What conclusion do you draw from the clues? A corpse is not unleashed! I'm going to pass out. Yes that's what you want. Where is it? How do I know? Possibly not the cops! What did you gag him with? With my scarf. Did it bear your initials? I had no other. Out of here! Out of! Let's go outside. I beg of you, let me help you! I don't see you can do anything else! You already gave me enough trouble! - You are unfair. - Unfair. Unfair. If they find out they found Streeter here with his scarf in his mouth ... I've already had hard blows in my life, but with you, it's second to none! Oh God, you said that ... I withdraw what I said. I was right from the beginning. There is no woman whose brain works. All I want is for you to leave me. After what you did, the cops will show up in a few hours. Now I have a chance in a thousand, I'll manage alone Â¡Oh, no Guy! Do you want to see your late husband at the Saugerties Theater on Wednesday? Cigarettes - Would you let me? - Thanks. Where is the car? Near his country house. Have you spoken with him? What can you tell me Ask for a million. That's impossible. Good luck. Be careful! I beg your pardon. It was an extraordinary experience. Once we were ... Pay a little attention! IM so sorry. And you know ... The curtain rises in 5 minutes. - What are we doing here? - We're waiting. Do we cover the exits? Four men are enough Has Lupton Peabody arrived? I haven't seen it. The curtain rises in 5 minutes. Is the text known? Yes, of course. Have you seen Lupton Peabody? Yeah, he's the one organizing the lights up there. In agreement? - I thought you got caught. - About. Has it arrived at once? - Who? - The killer, Vivian. Incarnate cruelty. She acts like nothing happens. - Has nothing to do. - What? I thought my last hour had come! It was not. I have a job for you. - Who was? - A friend of mine. Look for these three guys. Explain, what friend? A girl I picked up. Wasn't it Vivian? Not waste time. - Who is it? - You know her. And did she hit me? - To help me. - Help you? Yes. He took you for a cop and wanted to help me. Did he make a note of your name? - Who? - Police. Sure. I fainted. I couldn't lie! Were they controlling? They called the major. Oh then, all is lost! Miller and Koretz wiretapped us . Why don't you just go away? There is still a chance. If it's there, it's tonight. She has an accomplice behind the scenes. - Who? - I have no idea! We know neither the victim nor the murderer We have half an hour to find them. We have to solve a crime not yet committed, preventing it. I give up. Wait. I haven't told you everything yet. - Do you have a clue? - Do not. There is 100,000 dollars at stake. I've never seen anyone so greedy. You will have your part. That is the deal. I carried out my research. There are three possible names. That guy up there is one. Se llama Lupton Peabody. Go up to him and tell him Vivian sent you. The curtain rises. I am stunned. It's okay. Come on, dominate! Be attentive while unloading rifles Where is she? You do not see. He's in the last row. Excuse me, are you Mr. Peabody? I am a friend: "half a coin" I come from part ... from Vivian who sent me. I have $ 500,000 for you. Mr. Delmonico, get rid of this madman, he's crazy. What are you doing? It's bothering me. Leave him alone. There's no worse fool than an old fool. - Excuse me. - I'm busy. - I have to talk with you. - Who are you? I am Edwina Corday. I help Guy Johnson. They are in the room. You are crazy, they are going to catch Johnson! I don't have time to explain it to them, they are in the room. Who are you talking about? Who is there? - The police officers! - Miller and Koretz? Yes. Seeing them, I almost fainted. Do you see them? Yes, of course I see them. We are lost. No wait. I removed five names. Two or three remain. - Three what? - Actors from the dressing room 7. Is it happening there? Look who dresses in the dressing room 7. You know they are in dressing room 7, it's wonderful! Look at the scene. Are there any dead? No, they are arguing. Can I help you? Go sit down again and watch the cops. - They're going to stop you. - Already, so what? It is a lost cause. As long as "half a coin" is alive there is hope. Standing, you have to move. Come on, the food is there. - Hey, buddy! - What happens? Is it from dressing room 7? Yes, but I have changed. I have a question for you. I enter the scene immediately. I'll be brief, just a question. I will not speak to strangers before acting. As is, half a coin. Please, I have to get out now! We will discuss it later. I was a locomotive mechanic in Louisiana. There have been three accidents in the past year. The war has arrived. If only there was one locomotive ... - Who are they? - Sailors, sir. Â¡Capitan Flag! Captain Flag, I'm bleeding! Captain Flag, I'm bleeding! A doctor! It's hurt. Make a public announcement. Go and calm them down. Ladies and gentlemen, do not worry. If there is a doctor in the room, let him come backstage. Thanks. Butler. Butler, Â¿me oye? Try to say something, I beg you! Come on tell me. Who shot him? I do not know. This way, doctor. Do not stay here there has been an accident. Stay away! Police! Is this the victim? We are Inspector Miller, and Inspector Koretz. You will be more useful than me. Is dead. I don't understand, we must have put a real bullet by mistake. Bullets. Let no one get out of here! Block the exits! I want to see everyone who was backstage. I was waiting to say the text with him. - Really? - Yes. Who are you? My name is Hemingway, sir. How did he know? I really do not know. I thought I heard the poor boy moan. Oh what a mess! The audience leaves. What are we going to do! Who is the director? It's me. Look, I found someone here. Run! Who is it? I do not know. It was on the ground. It's Streeter! Yes look. Awake! Where was it? This sandbag must have fallen on him. Come on, come to your senses. Wake up Wake up, Streeter! Come to yourself. - Where is it? - Who? I do not know. Someone hit me. Twice in a day? I do not know how he does it. Someone hit me. Bring me a double whiskey. What do you know about the actor's murder? - The actor? - Yes. Don't play innocent. So they did it? That is why they surprised me. - How? - Nothing. Where's Guy Johnson? Play fair and everything will be fine. - Where's Johnson? - I do not know. I don't even know who I am. Where I am? Where I am? I see creatures climbing the walls, help! Help! Guy, era "media moneda". They killed him like you said. What are you doing? My suitcases! - Are you running away? - They have won. - Where to? - I'll send you a letter. You can not do it. You were right, she has murdered him. - And then? - Do not give up now. Leave. - You're still free. - Not for much longer! You have to go to the end. The game is not over yet. - Let me go. - No. - I'm going to really hit you! - Listen to me first. - Damn, he's dead. You can't run away, you deserve better. You are one of the types who fight even though all is lost. You can say what you want, I already know you. I have the opportunity to escape to Canada I'm going there. Let go. You can win, you are right. One day I wrote this poem just for you. "There was no escape "and laughed under the blows, in the desert of defeat "her heart blossomed like a rose." Ok, you wanted it! Mr. Hermingway, thank goodness I found it. Poor Mrs. Johnson, what a calamity! Those horrible cops want to see you. Poor boy, his debut has been tragic. I was so happy to replace Ned Brown. Replacing who? Oh, they will interrogate us all! Who replaced Ned Brown? The young man who was murdered. He was very nice, poor man. Did you replace an actor? Yes, Ned Brown had the flu, and I entrusted the role to George. Where is the? Who? The guy who should be dead. Oh, Ned Brown is in the tourist village. - In which bungalow? - In the 3. Tourist village. Bungalow 3. Yes. Poor Mrs. Johnson, she falls. Wait. I will use my salts. Hurry up. They await you. C'mon C'mon. Whoa, what do we have here! Come on, Johnson. Make a little effort. It looks like a decorative object on a Christmas tree! Welcome. Record it, inspector. Hands up. I'll get this back. - Where were you? - They hit me on the head. It's okay. Come on captain, come with your partner. So they can go on a honeymoon. In this flashy car. And fast! Did you see him? He hit me on the head again while I was on duty. I have to talk to you. Listen to me. - Everything you say will be used against you. - It is the opportunity of their lives. The key to GonzÃ¡lez's murder and that of the young actor. - Who is he talking about? - They lived! Vivian Heyward murdered Dolores and the young actor. You are already starting with your circus! That's why I jumped off the train, I can prove it. That you will tell the judge. There was a homicide. This is not our sector. And another is being prepared. Don't try to buy time ... You kind of fucking detectives! A man is going to be killed and you flee like two mangy dogs after being beaten. He had dreamed of it for a long time. Come on, get up! Quick, get up! - Now you can with the weak! - You have the right to that too. It does not give you the right to do it with everyone. Oh get up there! Let's go in! - He wants to get off. - Are you a policeman? - What do you mean? - Take it. I was afraid that he would escape. Another dirty trick and you will spend 5 years in jail. Are you kidding me? I have worked for the police from the beginning. Wait. Don't just quit. Guy Johnson is a murderer. Shut up, stupid. She has gone mad. He is a murderer! He killed Dolores GonzÃ¡lez. She was a very dear friend of mine. He killed her out of jealousy in her room, and made her lover Heyward accused. What are you talking about? From Johnson. Guy Johnson. I can prove it. He's kind of a double agent, get out of this car! Do you want to tell me where you want to go? Johnson jumped off the train because someone knew everything. The poor actor who died tonight. Did Johnson murder him? Yes, I pretended to fall in love with him, to help him. Shut up! She is crazy to tie! I have proof. His letters to Dolores. They are in the tourist village, in bungalow no. 3. This is where I wanted to go. The actor had them. Wake up at once. Johnson has never killed anyone. Take us to New York. Look, he tried to kill me when he realized that I knew. - Are you telling the truth? - I swear. I swear by my eyes. If you know me, you will know that I am the most sacred. By my eyes that Johnson is a murderer. What do you say, Johnson? You are a viper! Did you think that I loved you? What was an idiot who was undone for you! What is he playing at? And that he is innocent! He is the accessory to the two murders. I swear I'm going crazy! Shut up, they won't believe it. They will see the cards. Threats in writing and in the journal. Whose diary, Madame? The diary that the young actor wrote about Guy Johnson. He taught it to me. In the cupboard behind the bottles, he swore it by my eyes. Where is that tourist village located ? Six miles from here, just past the station. He's already cheated on you, huh, Miller? Leave that to the judge. You knew it would end up catching you! 6 miles in this direction? Yes, yes, quickly, quickly. Keep it there and don't lose it. I'll take care of it, madam. I watch them, go get the newspaper. We can't just go in like this. We would have to have a search warrant. - What happen? - They are there. Who is it? Draw your weapon. Why? Lower, they can hear you. What's going on here? They are in there. Who are inside? The murderers of Dolores and the actor tonight. Madame, answer me, is there a diary or not? - There is much more than that. - What? The murderers of Dolores Gonzalez. Enough already, let's go to the car. Let's go, Mata-Hari! They are there! Surround the house. Come on get out of here. They try to escape. What's going on here? The guy in the dressing gown is "half a coin." Leave me Â¡CÃ¡llese! Come on, explainer! This does not concern them, this man has lost his mind. We are going to commit him. Watch out, he's armed! Watch out, Guy! Hey, come back! You would miss a cow in a hallway. It is too much what is happening here. Catch him, I take care of the girl. Leave him! I have the gun. Come on, guys stand up. Here is your man. Vivian Heyward. What do you have to say, Madame? Refusing to talk, huh? She is a murderer as well as a bigamist. I hope you have nothing. Come on come on wake up! Go! Forgive me for swearing on my eyes, but I had to! I should punish myself severely but there was a life at stake - Give me this! - Oh yeah! Keep an eye out for the prisoners. I'm going to question this guy. What are you doing gagged and barefoot? Let's go inside! Let no one move until the mystery is cleared up. Great job, friend! You hit me, you are going to pay me. I'm going to be a weather vane but I take back what I said. You are a genious. He swore it by my eyes! Seriously? Oh baby I'm sorry! I did not want to! Nevermind honey, I deserved it Listen Johnson, Ned Brown says this woman is his wife and that she wanted to kill him. He had caught Heyward in the trap. Do you confirm it? All I know is that I wrote a poem. "Roses are red, violets are purple. "I just won $ 100,000 "But I love you!".
