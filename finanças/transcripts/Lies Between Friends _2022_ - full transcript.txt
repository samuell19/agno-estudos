We'll figure it out. Mm. Didn't you apply for a scholarship or... Did those come through? - Yeah, yeah. They did. But it doesn't cover housing. Seattle's so expensive. - Well, you can stay here as long as you like. - School's like two hours away. Besides, I can't live in your place forever. It's too bad I don't know anyone who lives in seattle. - Ollie lives in seattle. - Ollie? - Yeah. Maybe I can give him a call. (chuckles) - Um, when was the last time you even talked to him? - Ooh, oh, it's been a while. - That's okay, I'll figure something else out. I'm sure they have like a... Lottery or public housing, or something. - Hey, maybe he knows of an affordable place. Or heck, maybe he even has a room. - I mean, are you sure you don't mind asking? - You're my daughter, I'd do anything for you. Besides, he'd probably like to see an old friend. He owes me. Used to do all his coding for his huge company he sold. - Thanks, dad. It's really nice of you. Dad, it's 9 am. - It was from last night. - You have any job interviews today? - No. I could send my resume out today, okay? Promise. - Thanks, dad. I love you. - I love you too.

Who is this guy exactly? - He's like an old college roommate, I haven't seen the guy in like 20 years. Maybe I should just block his number. - A little drastic, why don't you just see what he wants? - Yeah, you're right. Listen, I'm sorry about this morning, But I cannot miss this meeting. Are you okay to take 'em? - Yes. I'll prep for my meeting in the car. - You're the best. I love you. - Love you. - Okay, hey. Good luck. - Thanks.

It's been crazy busy around here, It's the end of quarter, but come on, Let's grab a seat. We'll catch up. - Sure. - Yeah. So, how've you been? - I'm good. How's the wife and family? (chuckling) - well, you know. Rolling right along. So, you drove here all the way from aberdeen? (sighs) - Well, you weren't returning my calls, So I figured I'd just come to you. Company's on google. Big picture Of you on the website. - Hm. So... What did you need to talk to me about, steve? - Look, I know it's been a long time but my daughter, emily, She got into seattle tech. Top school in the state. Can you believe it? - Wow, that's great. - Yeah. Only thing is her scholarship doesn't cover housing. And things are a little tough for me right now financially. - Okay. - Do you know of any affordable places? Maybe a friend's got a spare room Or a guest house or something? - You know, I haven't really heard of anything like that. Has she checked online or... - Yeah. Yeah, she has. (clears throat) I don't suppose you'd have any room, would you? - You know what, man? It's not really a good time right now. I got two young kids at home, Claire's starting a new business-- - Oh, emily wouldn't be a bother. She'll even help babysit, I promise. She's great with kids. She'll earn her keep. I promise. Here. See? Look at that. Face of an angel. She means the world to me. Ever since my wife died, it's just been the two of us. - She seems great. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife. I didn't know. - Thanks. So, what do you say? (chuckles) you do kinda owe me. - Okay, I'll tell you what. Why don't I run it by claire, See what she says? (laughing) - I knew you'd say yes! Thank you, ollie, you're gonna love her. She's into technology, just like you. - Alright, I still need to run it by claire. - Thank you. - I mean... It's a little weird. You barely mentioned the guy, Now you want his daughter to come live with us? - We were really good friends back in college. I just thought it'd be a nice gesture. - Well, if you were so close, how come you lost touch? - Well, he sort of lost his way after school, Never really found his footing professionally. We just kind of drifted apart. - Hm. - But his daughter sounds great. Really smart and... I don't think she's had a lot of opportunities, And I really don't think she has any other options. And we do have that big guest house That's just sitting out there unused. But, you know, you're right. It's a distraction. I'll call steve and tell him that, you know, we can't do it. - Well, no, wait a minute. I didn't say no. - So, is that a yes? - Well, let's meet her first. - Deal. - Alright. - Hm. (classical music) - You must be emily. - So nice to meet you. - Please, come on in. - Thanks. - Yeah. Excuse me. - Oh, sorry. (chuckles) - So, seattle tech's a hard school to get into. Congrats. What are you studying? - Computer engineering. Sort of obsessed with technology. - Well that's impressive. - And I heard you're starting your own business? That's so admirable! I'd love to do that too some day. - Yeah, well, it's just early stages, so... - Oh. - Hey, guys, guys! Come on here. I want you to meet somebody. This is emily. Emily's dad went to college with your dad. This is sophie and this is charlie. - Oh, hi there. - Hey! (laughs) - He gets a little shy with new people. - Oh, that's okay, I am too.

I can drive. - Well, I have my own car, It doesn't really make sense for you to drive separately. - Okay, well, ride with you and take the bus back. - Dad, that's not necessary, but thank you. - You sure? I can help you unpack, make it more homey. Besides, I want to check out the security system to make sure-- - Dad, I'm gonna be fine. - I know.

Come on, tell me, tell me all about it. - Well, it's for a wedding, for pam's friend. She has access to some really exclusive vendors. - Nice. So, how much are they paying you? - Well, I had to take a reduced fee because, you know, I don't have a lot of experience. But that's pretty typical when you're starting out. - Right. - What? - Well, it's just, I mean, I've started a few businesses over the years And I never had to work at a reduced rate. Aren't you devaluing your work? - Well, this is a different business Than the work that you do. You know, it's about exposure And building a name for yourself. - I just think you're being taken advantage of, sweetheart. I mean, shouldn't you demand to be paid what you're worth? - Do you know how many 25 year old women Would walk all over each other for this job? You think I wanna work for next to nothing? No, it's embarrassing. Ugh. I never should have quit. - Hey, no. Listen to me. You hated being a lawyer, okay? The long hours, the lack of creativity-- - It is really hard, starting over. - I know, you're right, I'm sorry. I have no idea what I'm talking about. We don't even need the money. Besides, I just, I just want you to be happy. - Hello. - Hi. - Hey. Um, I gotta run. I've got a meeting. But we'll talk more about this later. Okay? Oh-- - sorry. - Excuse me. (sophie): Mom! Charlie took my walkie-talkie! - Why don't you take the day off? (chuckles) go to a museum. Have a bath. I know you don't get much time to yourself. I'll take the kids to school, pick 'em up. - Oh, no, you do not have to do that. I'm fine. - No, seriously. Like, winter quarter Doesn't start 'til Monday. I have nothing to do. I'd love to help. - A bath does sound nice. (chuckles) And I do have some errands I could run. But are you sure about this? - Yeah, totally. Like, you'd be helping me feel useful. - Okay. Okay. Thank you, emily. That is really sweet of you. - Great. (children chattering) So? Do you like your school? - It's okay. - It's just okay? - Just okay. - Bye, emily. - See her backpack? So lame. - Have fun. See you in a few hours. (phone ringing) - Hello. Hi. Is everything alright with claire? I noticed you dropped the kids off. - Uh, yeah. She's fine. I'm just babysitting today. I just moved in with the family, I'm emily. - Pam. Pleasure. I'm a teacher here and claire's friend. Claire didn't mention she was getting help. Are you an au pair? - Um, yeah, something like that. I go to school nearby, seattle tech. - No way, my husband works there. He's in marketing. - Oh, no way. Small world. (chuckling) - Well, I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you. We're neighbours.

They bullying you? - I don't know. - You can talk to me, you know? Like, I'll keep our conversations private. - Mom already asked me about them. I begged her not to call their moms. - Oh. You know, I had a bully once. - You did? - Mm-hmm. Allison. When I was eight. Beat me up once. - What'd you do? - Uh, let's just say sometimes, You gotta give bullies a taste of their own medicine, You know what I mean? - I should be mean to them? - No, absolutely not. Um, why don't you just let me handle this, okay? I promise I won't like, call anyone's mom. - Okay. - Hello? - Hi. - Hi. Uh, where are the kids? - They're in bed. - Really? Well, it's only 8 o'clock. - Yeah. I ran them pretty good this afternoon. They were exhausted. - Did you do all of this? - I did. I hope it's okay, I'm still like, learning to cook. - No, it's incredible. But I'm afraid it's just gonna be you and me. Ollie called. He's gonna stay late at work. Again. - Oh. Save him a plate? - Sometimes it just feels like his career Is the only one that matters, you know? Like, I used to be a high-powered lawyer. And now, I'm just a housewife with a hobby. (chuckles) I mean, I know This sounds silly, but ever since I was a little girl, All I ever wanted to do was plan events. Anyway, boring married people stuff. I think I've had too much to drink, I'm sorry. - No, not at all, no. It's like... Sometimes you just need to vent. - Okay, but I wanna talk about you. How's your dad? - Uh, honestly? Not great. He's... He's always had a drinking problem. You know, ever since the incident, With ollie's girlfriend in college. - Right. Yeah. - But it's been really bad lately. And work hasn't exactly been going well either. Not that it ever has. - What does your dad do? - Oh, he's always kind of starting companies. Yeah, failed ones. (chuckles) Not like your husband's. Like, my dad can't even Get past the pitching stage. Like, ollie sold flair technologies for what? Like 200 million? Right? It's like, no wonder you guys have such a gorgeous house. - Yeah, something like that. - No, truly. It's incredible. Like, I've never been around such nice things. It's a little overwhelming. - Well, we're just really glad you're comfortable. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you something. - Really? - Yeah! Just a little something to thank you for today. - Oh! (soft music) Oh, I love it! Thank you! - Aw, you're so welcome. (chuckling) (birds chirping) - You seem well rested. - Yeah, well, thanks to emily. She's been a huge help with the kids. Even cooking dinner. I mean, I finally have A little extra time to myself. She's amazing. - That's great, hon. - You know, it's pretty miraculous What she's accomplished given her upbringing. Did you know steve's an alcoholic? - No, that's awful. I mean, I knew he ran Into some problems after college, but-- - Yeah, you know, she mentioned an incident With an old girlfriend of yours. What's the deal there? - Oh, she... She knows about that. - Knows about what? - This... This girl I was dating, she... She overdosed on some pills that steve bought. He got in some trouble with the police, it was a... It was a bad situation. - Was she okay? - She died, actually. - Ollie. That's horrible. I can't believe you've never told me that. - Well, it's not an easy subject to talk about. - Was... So, steve was some kind of drug dealer? - No, no, no. It was just like a one time thing, A tragic mistake. We were just kids. - You were adults. - Hey. You okay? - Yeah, I'm just trying to process all this. - You're right, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was thinking. I should have told you. - Um. I got a call with a vendor. (clears throat) (dramatic music) (indistinct chatter) - Bye, emily. - Have a good day. Hey, charlie. Come here for a second. I need you to do me a favour, okay? See that lady over there? I need you to ask her about the pythagorean theorem. Okay? (mysterious music) - Excuse me. I wanted to talk to you about the-- - What are you asking me? Speak up. - I wanted to talk to you About the "pytharagum" theorem. (chuckles) - the pythagorean theorem? - Uh, yeah. - Well, that is a very good question, little man. I see. Well. I know it's greek. That's for sure. And it has to do with science and gravity. - Hey, bud. Ready to go in? - Yeah. - Sorry about that, I'm emily. - Ellen. Pleasure. (sinister music) - Yes. Police? Um, one of the mothers at peach tree academy Has been driving erratically all morning. I don't know, I think she's on drugs or something. Okay, come quick, she's about to start her car. It's a... It's a black luxury suv. Yeah, you can't miss it. (engine starting) (police siren) (indistinct chatter) - What? What is he doing? - You're under arrest. - I've never seen that before... (ominous music) - Hello? Hello? - Hey mom. - Oh, hey, babe. Um, where's emily? - I don't know? Maybe upstairs. - Oh yeah? (mysterious music) Emily? - Oh god. - What are you doing? - You scared me. Um, sophie wanted to play dress-up, I was just seeing if you had any costume jewellery. - Sophie has her own costume jewellery. - Oh, great. Um, where is it? - It's in her room. In a jewellery box, on the dresser. - I'll go look. Thanks. - So what, you think that she stole something? - I mean, nothing was missing, but... I felt really violated. - I'm sure it was just an innocent mistake. She probably did think that There was costume jewellery up there. - Maybe. But I'm starting to wonder though if it was a bad idea Having her come stay with us. She seemed to know a lot of details about your ex-company, Flair technologies. I mean, financial details. Stuff that wasn't public. - Well, steve knew some of that stuff. He probably told her. - So is steve sketchy? - What? - Yeah. I mean, after everything you told me About the drugs and the girl... Like, could they be running some kind of con on us? - No. No. I mean, yeah, he's got some problems, But who wouldn't after everything he's been through? He's like the nicest guy in the world. He's totally harmless. - Well, he's still responsible For that girl's death though, right? - No, that was an accident. (sighs) He doesn't have a bad bone in his body. Besides, emily's doing great, she doesn't need to con anybody. - That's true. - Okay. What should we watch here? Sharks or zombies? - Sharks, I guess. - Maybe we'll get some zombie sharks if we're lucky. (chuckles) (tv): Three easy payments of 109.99. (mysterious music) (birds chirping) (door opening) - hey. Emily. I'm just gonna take the kids to school today. - Oh. Okay. You sure? I don't mind. - Yeah. I'm sure. - Great. - Oh.

I saw a job posting at my school for an event planner. I submitted you an interview tomorrow. It pays a lot. - Are you serious? - Yeah. I mean, I had to fib a little About your experience, but whatever. Um, here's the details. I should have asked you first, but the deadline was right away. - Wow. Emily, thank you. - Of course. And hey, I'm really sorry about the whole jewellery thing. Like, I really was just looking For something for sophie. - No, it's okay. I understand. - Oh, and I was thinking. I know you said you wanted To have dinner as a family, but why don't you And ollie go out? I can babysit. - Oh, um, I don't know. - I've heard great things about that new french spot. Cafe bleu. - Oh, that place? That's impossible to get into. We would never get a reservation this late. - Well, a girl in my class works there. Maybe she could help. - You think? - It's worth a shot. - Okay, why not? - Yeah! Okay. - Okay, yeah. Thank you so much, emily. - Of course. - Wow. I have an interview. This is incredible. I can't believe emily got us in here. - You know, I'm surprised you're letting her babysit After the whole jewellery incident. - Yeah, I should not have jumped to conclusions on that. I feel bad for misjudging her. - Well, we all make mistakes, right? Me especially. - It's a little embarrassing how long it's been Since we've been on a date. - That's my fault. I'm sorry that I've been working so much lately. And listen, I know we never really finished Our conversation the other day. I'm sorry I never told you about the girl who died. It was a very painful time for me and I guess It's just hard to talk about, but... It's no excuse. I should have told you. And I promise I'm gonna be better about work. - Really? 'cause it's charlie's Karate performance tomorrow night. He would be so sad if you missed it. - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Good. You don't have any other secrets you're hiding, right? - Uh, of course not. Oh. - Thank you. - Thanks. - This looks so good. - It does, right? - So, tell me about seattle.

It's crazy he made so much money Off the sale of that one company. - You know I helped come up with the idea of that company? - Um, sorry, I thought you just did some coding? - Well, we were batting around ideas back in college And that was one of them. - Why weren't you compensated then? - Well, I was paid for the coding. - If it was your idea, You should have been the co-founder. - Well, I had all those legal problems and we didn't want To give the company a bad look-- - And he never made it right with you? - I mean, he bought me place. (laughs) - Dad, he lives in a 10-million-dollar mansion! - Well, I was lucky he hired me at all, given I was a felon. - Lucky? You let him walk all over you! - Enough! I'm not bitter about how things turned out, You shouldn't be either. (chuckles) - Is that why you're already on your third beer at lunch? - For your information, I am celebrating. - What are you celebrating? - I came up with this brilliant new app idea.

(sighs) - Oh, boy. - Okay. Think cats. - Okay. - Do you have a cat? - No. - Okay, well, I have cats. And believe me, while they're a pain to clean up after, They can enhance our life in ways we cannot even imagine. - Okay. - So, it's like a game, right? Like, animal crossing. But entirely with cats.

You know how much money unicorn village made last year? - That's... That's a good point. (light music) (sighs) - You think he'd let us take it for cheap? (sighs) - Probably, I... (crickets chirping) - To your new job! (chuckles) - And to you who helped me get it. - Mom? - Hmm? - Where's dad? He's gonna miss my performance again. - Alright, well, we still have a minute, he'll be here, sweetheart. Where is he? Sophie, honey, you're in your pajamas? - I don't have anything to wear. - Okay, I will help you. Charlie, you got to get your shoes on. You two, upstairs and I'll meet you there, okay? (chuckles) (steps climbing) (mysterious music) - Hello! Hey, I'm home, sorry I'm late, But I'm all dressed and ready to roll... - Hey. - Where is everybody? - Oh, they're just getting sophie out of her pajamas. - Oh. (laughs) - Do you want one? - Yes, yeah, great. I'm just gonna check this email real quick here. Uh... Ugh, these work emails, they just never stop, They keep coming, day and night. - Well, no rest for the wicked, right? (chuckles) - yeah, I guess. Oh, hey. Your dad came in to pitch, today. - Oh, right. How'd that go? - It went... It went good, we're gonna really think about it. - That's great. I mean, it's the least you could do, right? I mean, technically, he was the cofounder of flair technologies. (chuckles) I mean, we sort of... Batted around a few ideas, but that's different From actually executing it. - Well, this will be a good opportunity to make things right, won't it? - Right, uh... Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go see if claire needs a hand. - Let me know if you need anything. (sombre music) (sighs) - Hey. You ready? We gotta go, we're gonna be late. - Oh, I shouldn't have had champagne on an empty stomach. - Oh, I'm sure you'll feel better by the time we get there. We got to go. - Oh, god. - What's wrong? - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Oh. Uh... (puking) Honey? You okay? Alright, let's get you all cozied up. - Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't know what happened. (mysterious music) - Hey. - Hey. - I made some tea and here's some plain crackers. - Thank you, emily, that's really helpful. - Do you want me to take them to the performance? - Oh, could you? I can't leave him alone here like this. - Of course. - Oh, I feel awful, charlie's been looking forward to this for ages. He's gonna be devastated. - I'll take a video for you. I hope he feels better. - Thank you. Alright. - Oh, god. (door slams) (puking) (soft music) - Can you guess what it is? - A teddy bear. - Thanks, emily. (laughs) - Hey. How are you feeling? - Ah, a little better, thanks. - Hey, bud, how was karate? I can't wait to go to the next one. - Whatever, emily can just take me. - What, hey... - Emily, you were a real life saver last night. - Oh, it's nothing. - No, seriously, if you hadn't been here, Charlie would have missed his performance altogether. I don't know how to thank you. - Oh, please. You would have done the same for me. - Oh! - Really. (mysterious music) - Oh, god. What a nightmare. At least no-one else got sick. - Yeah, emily really saved the day. - She turned out to be really something, huh? - Oh, I honestly do not know what I would Do without her at this point. - You know, I was thinking. - Hmm. - Wouldn't it be great if emily was featured In the recruiting brochure for seattle tech? Hmm? She's incredible. And from what you've told me, She has a really inspirational story. - I think that's a great idea. - I'll pitch paul on her. - Yes, great. I'll give you her contact info. - Wonderful. I got to get to class. I'm so glad ollie's feeling better. (chuckles) - thank you. - I don't want to go! They hate me. - It's gonna be okay. You can't stay home from school again. Just ignore those girls. I love you. (sighs) - This is all your fault! - Loser! (sombre music) - It was just so unlike her. Cruel. I honestly don't even know what to say to her. - Well, I'll talk to her tomorrow. But hey, um... There's something that I wanted to talk to you about. - What's up? - It's emily. I think she may have poisoned me or something last night. (laughs) - what? - No, I'm serious, She made this really weird comment, And then she gave me the champagne and then, I mean, you saw what happened. - Well, what did she say? - She implied that I owed it to steve to buy his pitch Because he should have been a cofounder of flair technologies. - Well, should he have? - We did come up with the idea together, But then the whole thing with the overdose happened And he had all these legal problems. It just wasn't a good look to investors To have him involved, so he agreed to back out. - I see, that is a sticky situation. - Yeah, there's... There's more. - What? - Claire, I haven't been... Completely honest with you about everything. - What is it? - Um... I don't even... (melancholic music) I never told this to anyone in my life. I don't want to have any secrets between us, okay? I love you. - Ollie. Tell me. - I was the one that gave anna the drugs. - What? - I was just a stupid kid, I bought them off some random guy, We all took them and then, steve and I were totally fine, And then, the police showed up, and when they questioned us, Steve just volunteered and I didn't stop him. I just let him take the fall. - Oh. Ollie. - All the legal stuff happened and steve went to jail... My parents, like, freaked And they didn't want me to see him anymore And I had... Investors breathing down my neck... I feel terrible. I mean, maybe I should go to the cops, Admit that it was me, confess it all? - Now, just wait a minute, okay? Let's just think about this, you know, Before you do anything rash... - Isn't that the right thing to do? - Yes, yes, of course, it is the right thing to do And... You should probably own up to it. But... I mean, will it really make that much of a difference now? I mean, it's not gonna erase The last 20 years of steve's life. It's gonna make our lives worse. I mean, think about the kids. - I know, it's... I just feel so guilty... I've been shoving it down all these years And then, I see steve again, I see how his life turned out. He was my best friend, I... How could it do that to him? - Shh, it's okay. It's okay. Does emily know? - I don't think so. - Okay, let's keep it that way. Okay? For now. And you should do right by steve. You got to buy his pitch, give him a good deal. Do everything you can to make that a success, Because he deserves it. And as for emily, I mean... Maybe we ask her to move out? We can buy her an apartment. We will do right by them, ollie. It's just that right now, we need time, you know? We need space and time to figure out what to do. (chuckles) - I'm so lucky to have you, I love you so much. - Oh, I love you too, come here. (dramatic music) (clock ticking) What is this? Is this for me? - Yup. We already ate. And I should get going If I'm gonna get the kids to school on time. - Oh, thank you for taking the kids! - I mean, they are mine too, right? (laughing) - Thanks, babe. - Bye. - Oh, hey, where's emily? - Oh, you know what, I haven't seen her. See you. - Okay, bye. - Bye, hon. (crickets chirping) (sombre music) - Hey. Well, if this isn't the best surprise? Everything okay? - You took the fall for that jerk? - What are you talking about? - Ollie! The drugs were his? - Technically, I-- - He should have been arrested! He should have been the one to go to jail And have his career prospects ruined! - Hey, now, emily-- - I'm gonna kill him. - Emily, calm down. Emily calm down! I took the drugs too, after all. - Why are you still defending him? Why did you even do it? - Because he was my best friend. And he had more to lose than I did. He had money and family and I didn't have anything. Ollie was my family! He paid for my entire college with his trust fund. - His trust fund. Oh, what a sacrifice! God, you're such a pushover, dad! Okay, best friends don't let their best friends Go to jail for them, alright? They don't cut their best friends out of million-dollar deals! He disappeared! He left you to become an alcoholic. He left you to just wither and die! - Emily just, please, put the knife down! - I'll go to the cops with this. No, I'll go to the newspapers. That snob thinks he can take me out, walk all over my dad? I'll ruin him! - Emily, please don't, he bought my pitch! We signed the papers this morning. - He did? - Yeah, look, he gave me a great deal. Please, emily, don't blow this for me. - That's not enough. Dad, he still owes You millions for flair. He ruined your life and he needs to pay! - Emily, just give me the knife! (dramatic music) - Dad? (clock ticking) Dad! Dad! (sobbing) I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to. Oh, god, please! Dad! Oh... (sobbing) No, no! No! (dramatic music) I'm so sorry! (sobbing) (crickets chirping) (sombre music) (birds chirping) Is everything okay? You guys seem serious. - Oh yeah, no, it's fine. Um, we just wanted to talk with you, Because ollie and I have been discussing everything And as you know, we've got a lot going on right now... - A lot, we've been really, very busy. - Yeah, so we were thinking that it might be best if... (knocking at door) Who is that? - Uh, I don't know. (mysterious music) (dramatic music) (sobbing) - I can't believe he's dead! I just can't believe it. - I'm so sorry, emily. (sobbing) - It's okay, it's okay. I'll go with you, we'll do it together, okay? (sobbing, panting) (soft music) - I can't even go into the home I grew up in. - Oh, I'm sure you'll be able to get in soon, okay? Did your dad have pets? - Cats. They must have run off. - Oh... Well, we can try and look for them, alright? I'll put up flyers. - I can't believe I'm an orphan! - Emily... (sobbing) Emily... Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. (indistinct, sobbing) - He didn't have a life insurance, I can't even afford a funeral for him! - It's okay, we will cover the costs, whatever it is. - Thanks, claire. (sobbing) I don't know what I'd do without you guys. - No, of course. You're family to us. Okay? - Your kids are lucky to have such an amazing mom. It's too bad you can't adopt me. (sobbing) - Okay, come here. (sobbing) (soft music) It's okay. - We just bought his pitch, things were looking up for him. - It's tragic. - Yeah. Terrible way to go, and now, emily's got no family. - You know, she said something, She made a really weird comment at steve's place today. She said she wished we'd adopt her. - Really? - Hmm. - Yikes. - What are we gonna do about her? I mean, it's a little heartless to kick her out now, right? - I don't know, is it? - I mean, her dad was just murdered. She has no other support system. - I just... I really don't want her here. There's something off about her. - Well, let's at least give her a couple more weeks, you know? So, she can find her footing a little bit. - Okay, but I'm gonna watch her like a hawk. I don't trust her. - I mean, it's two weeks. How much damage can she do? (indistinct conversation) (engine starts) (dramatic music) - Sorry, actually, I have to go. (dramatic music) (phone buzzing) - Hey, pam. Sorry I missed your calls. My phone was on silent. What's going on? - I saw emily earlier today at a local jeweller. It looked like she was pawning some of your things. - That is strange. - I'm sure I'm overreacting, I debated even calling, But I could've sworn it was your necklace. - Well, I'm going to look now. (suspenseful music) I don't know. Yeah. Well, if it were me, We already had one strange jewelry incident with her. Yeah. (♪) Hmm... Well... Everything seems to be here. You know, maybe it was something else. - Oh, good. Thank god. Ha, I must be going crazy. I am so sorry for butting in. She was probably just getting something of her dad's appraised. (laughs) - No, no, I appreciate you calling. I mean, you never know, right? Thanks, pam. (dramatic music) (panting) (birds chirping) I'm just gonna run a few errands. Yeah, it gets her excited about us taking them for dinner and movie tonight. Okay, don't work too hard. Love you. (door creaking) (crickets chirping) (mysterious music) (beep!) (keys clacking) (beep!) (beep!) (sighs) (beep!) (ding!) (dramatic music) - Holy... (birds chirping) - Hey. Hey, how are you feeling? (chuckles) You should take it easy today, okay? Um... I've got a meeting with a fundraiser, But ollie will take the kids to school. - Right, are you sure? I don't... (sobbing) - Oh... Come here. - Sorry. - No, no, no. You need to focus on you, okay? (sobbing) But will you be okay alone? - Yeah. Of course. (sniffling) - Everything alright? - Yeah. - Have either of you seen my phone? I can't seem to find it anywhere. - Is that it, right there? - Hm? That's weird, I must have forgot to plug it in last night. Okay. (knocking on door) - Hey, ollie. Can we come in? - Of course, yeah. What's this? You brought legal. What's going on, you guys look serious. - We need to talk about the money. - What money? - The two million. You moved it to your personal account. (chuckles) - I have no idea what you're talking about. Hang on, I'll just... (dramatic music) what the hell? Okay, no, I didn't take anything. Alright, let me show you. Here's my personal account... Um... There was... It was transferred into my account, And then it got transferred to another account. I... I have no idea what this is. I... This wasn't me. Okay? I don't even know What this account is, it's... - I think you're gonna need to get a lawyer, ollie. - What... (scoffs) - Come on. - Aaron, I... (dramatic music) Claire, hey. Have you been on my computer? - What? Of course not. - It was her. - What are you talking about? - It was her! - Ollie? Hey! - No, no, no. I must have left it on, or maybe she guessed the password. - What are you talking about? - She stole money from my company. She framed me! - What? Is that even possible? Wait, what is this? - Huh? It's... - "I had the best time with you the other night, It's time to be honest with claire. I'll be dreaming of you, my love." What is this? - I... I don't know what that is. - That's pam! Pam, my good friend pam? - Okay, you know, it's fake! It's emily, okay, it's... - Is this pam's scarf? - Oh, I have no... I don't even know what it is. I have no idea how that got-- - Let me see your phone. - Yes, of course. There's nothing on it. (suspenseful music) What... Wait, okay, I don't remember downloading that. - Oh my god. - That's not... I did not write that! - This is really happening. - No, no, claire, look! She planted that, okay? It's... It's emily! Claire, come on, you gotta believe me, okay? Ask pam. None of this is true. - Just leave, ollie, please. - Claire, listen to me. I had nothing to do with this! - I cannot stand to even look at your face right now, So just leave, please! - Fine! Fine, fine. I'll go. But it wasn't me, okay? You have to know that. - Get out! (sad music) - I know what you did. You think you're winning this, but you're not. - I have no idea what you're talking about. (sighs) (dramatic music) I'm so sorry, claire. Men are pigs. - I didn't think ollie was. I didn't think he would do this! (sobs) - In case it wasn't obvious, I definitely didn't have anything to do with any of that. - No, I know. Um, there is something I need to tell you, though. Something I feel guilty about. - What is it? - I saw them together. Ollie and pam, a few weeks ago. - You did? - Yeah, I demanded ollie tell you the night of the karate Performance, but... He threatened me. He said that if I told you, he'd make up stories about me And get you to throw me out. (sobs) - Of course he did. (indistinct sobbing) - But... She said you'd never believe me And she'd make sure you didn't trust me. But I should have told you, I just... I didn't... ...Know what to do and then... My dad died and... I got distracted. - No, no, emily, it is okay. None of this is your fault. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. (phone buzzing) (scoffs) (beep!) - Claire, honey, listen to me. I know, I know this looks bad. But you have to believe me. Emily is psychotic. She's trying to ruin our lives. It's like some sort of twisted revenge game for her. I think... Claire, I think she even hurt steve. And look, I know I could be a better husband. I work too much, I put my career ahead of yours. I don't help out with the kids as much as I should, But... I love you. And I would never cheat on you, ever. I could never steal money from my company, Just please, before you do anything drastic, Just look into emily, please honey. For the kids' sake. (mysterious music) - Hey, how are you feeling? - Oh, I'm fine, I'm sorry I sobbed your ear off last night. - No, you needed that. Um, I'm here for you. Just want you to know that. - I appreciate that. - Of course. (laughs) - That's a cute bag. - Oh. - Is that a valentine? - Oh, it's fake. (laughs) I got it downtown. - A really good fake. (chuckles) - I know, right? (suspenseful music) (phone rings) - Seattle tech administration office, how can I help you? - Hi. Yes, I'm caring for a student that goes there And she recently lost both her parents. So, I just wanted to see how she's doing in school. - I'm sorry, we can't release grades Without the student's permission. - Oh. Right, I understand. Uh... You know what, can I just go ahead and pay her tuition For the next quarter? I'd love to surprise her. - Sure thing. What's the student's name? - It's emily bowser. - Um, I'm not coming up with an emily bowser. Would it be under a different name? - No, I don't think so. - There's only one bowser in the system. Benjamin? - No. - Sorry, I don't know what to tell you, She doesn't go here. - Yeah, weird. Okay, thanks anyway. (beep!) (car engine starts) (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) What? (gasps) (sombre music) (glass crackling) No life insurance, huh? (scoffs) (sombre music) - If this isn't the best surprise. Everything okay? (accelerating feed) - He should have been the one to go to jail And have his career prospects ruined! - Emily, calm down... (dramatic music) - And he needs to pay! - Just give me the knife! (screaming) (sobbing) - I'm so sorry! (suspenseful music) - Uh... (number dialling, phone ringing) - Claire, hey. You got my message-- - Ollie, ollie, ollie. You were right. I just saw steve's pet cam footage. She killed him. - What? - She murdered her father, ollie. You have to call the-- - surprise. - What? (muffled screaming) - Hello, claire? (screaming) Claire! Hello, claire! (dramatic music) (soft music) (panting) (coughing) - She wakes. Want a snack? - You're a monster. - I didn't mean to kill him. You think I don't feel like crap about that? - What are you gonna do with me? - Uh, not sure yet. - You're gonna kill me? - Oh, yeah. Of course. I have to now, sorry. I just meant I didn't know how I was going to do it yet. (dramatic music) Drink this. (gurgling) - Yeah, pam, I'll explain later, okay? Thank you for watching the kids. Yeah, I'll call when I can, thanks. (phone rings) (car engine starts) (coughs) - Emily. Before you hurt me, you need to think about charlie and sophie. - Oh, poor sophie and charlie, who go to private school And take karate lessons. Do you know what I would've given for a life like that? Instead, I grew up begging for free lunch at school. All because ollie couldn't take accountability for his mistakes. - That was wrong of him and I am sorry. - You know, I actually got into seattle tech. Against the odds, I studied hard and I made it in. No-one vouched for me. (grunting) No-one bribed my way in, it was all me. (coughs) - Why didn't you go? - I couldn't afford it, claire. Obviously. It's like you people have no concept Of how the world works when you don't have money. - I thought you got a scholarship. - Well, I didn't, okay? I just, like... Told my dad that so he wouldn't Feel bad about not being able to afford it. - Emily, we would have paid for you. - Yeah right. You would have paid for some kid you never met? The daughter of the guy ollie's Desperately trying to forget about? It's all good, though. Got my own money now. Thanks to your husband. He really should think of a more secure password, claire. (phone buzzing) Crap. (dramatic music) Oh, it's ollie! - Ollie... No. No, no! No! (grunting) (panting) (phone ringing) (beep! Beep!) - I know exactly how I'm gonna kill you. - How? - Relax, I'm not gonna stab you. Obvious much? (knife clinking) You gotta admit, it was kind of hilarious When I poisoned ollie, right? Open wide. - No... - No, claire! What's happening? (coughs) Too much to drink? Hmm... You know, it's just so sad. Like, none of us Would have ever suspected you were so upset about your separation You'd give yourself alcohol poisoning. Choking on vomit is such an unpleasant way to go. You really shouldn't have told him what you saw on tape, claire. Now, I have to kill him, too. Your kids are gonna be orphans. Like me. (dramatic music) - What the... (panting) Claire! (knocking) let me in! You won't get away with this! - I think I will, actually. I have a knife. I have a baseball bat. Where is that thing? - Why, you bitch! (grunts) Ollie! - Claire! You alright? - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm so sorry. You were right about everything. (sobs) I'm so sorry I didn't believe you. I love you so much. (dramatic music) - Okay. I love you too. (softly sobbing) - See you later, have a good day. - Bye mom, love you. - Ah, I love you too, sweetheart. (soft music) (indistinct conversations) - Hey. - Hey, sophie. Thanks for sitting with me. - Claire. - Pam, ugh! I am so happy to see you. I am so sorry for all those weird texts. Can I take you to coffee and explain? - I'd love that. (sighs) This weekend? - Yes, perfect. You know, I'm running late for a meeting, but talk soon? - Yeah. - Alright. - So, we'll remodel the space to have an area for therapy work And an area for the patients to live. And I just wanted to thank you all for your support And thanks for coming today. (indistinct chatter) - Babe, This is perfect. The steve bowser recovery centre. (chuckles) I think he would have loved it. - Yeah, I think so too. This was a... Great idea you had. - Thanks. - And his cat app is really taking off. - Oh yeah, I believe that, because I can't get sophie off of it. - We're gonna put all the proceeds right back into the foundation. - It's amazing. So, have you heard anything about emily? - I don't think she's gonna be released for a very long time. - Ah. Hopefully, she gets the help she needs. - Yeah, hopefully. - You think you can get away for lunch? - You know what, that sounds great. Maybe I'll take the rest of the afternoon off. - Wow, look at you! (laughing) (soft music) (dramatic music) Subtitling: Difuze
