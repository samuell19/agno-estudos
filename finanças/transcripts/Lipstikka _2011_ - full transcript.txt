I may have ended up living a different life. I may have even liked it. But it doesn't matter anymore, this is my life, I might as well live it, no questions asked. The man sitting next to me is my husband Michael. He's been having an affair for years now, perhaps even a few affairs. We never discuss this. I pretend I don't know, and he pretends he doesn't see I'm pretending. Happy birthday darling. Thank you. I tried to write happy birthday in Arabic... But I ran out of icing so it's a bit of a mess. Happy birthday. Thank you, that's very sweet of you. Want a drink? Yes, please. Happy booze day. I mean, birthday. Thank you, - Happy birthday, darling. Thank you, darling. Cheers. Cheers. We've been sleeping in separate beds for years, its been that way ever since we got married. A few months ago we moved into a bigger home which now allows us to sleep in separate rooms, but we play house quite well, probably a whole lot better then other couples. Clear over night. London traffic news now. Welcome, Andrew Foster, good morning. Hey, you're awake? - Yes I couldn't find the nail clippers in my room. I think I've got one in my drawer. Bob's picking me up today, he's just bought this disgusting new Porsche, Well, it's not new really, second hand, but still... Oh God, I'm so hung over. Your liver would go into shock if you weren't... Don't be like that Michael, I'm a lot friendlier when I'm drunk. Yeah, most alcoholics think that. Found them. Someone's supposed to come fix the dishwasher today. Good. Finally. Check out the mistress. She's a beauty. - Get in there. She's a dirty bitch but that's the way I like it. The milkman left two bottles. What are you doing here? Is this a bad time? It's early. - Really, well what time is it? Why didn't you call? And how did you get here anyway? What's the big deal? No big deal. Took a bus then tube then bus again. It's not that far, y' know. Right. Wow... Lara, so this is your new home. This is great, it's... Wow, you cunt. This is amazing... Not bad, Lara, not bad at all. Thanks. You look angry. Well... I came to say happy birthday. It is today isn't it? Yesterday. Do you want anything? Why not. What do you have? Coffee, tea. Got anything to eat? I'm starved No, not really, haven't been to the shops yet. You're still with Michael? - Yes. Where is he? - He's gone. Gone? You mean he left you? No, to work. He's gone to work. Is he still teaching? He's in advertising, he's doing very well actually. You look great. Liar. Really, your face it's just... Oh this. - Yeah. I stopped by Boots on the way here, they had this free make-over shit, you like? Got to fix my hair though, look at it, I got the worst hair dresser in the city. It looks fine. - Yolanda. Is that her name? "Hair by Yolanda" She's friendly, cheap. I wouldn't give her up for the world. I have to wake James. James? My son. Right, your son. How old is he? Seven. You keep the house very tidy. The cleaning lady is coming tomorrow. The cleaning lady... A husband, a son and a cleaning lady. Stop it. Anyway, I have to take James to school so... Why didn't you tell me you moved? You should've at least phoned or sent a card. I know, I'm sorry. So, where's the boy? Can I see him? Now's not a good time. Oh Lara, please, please, please, please, I'll just say hello and go. Okay. Wait here. Thanks. And no Arabic! Inam. Lara, Lara, Lara...! What took you so long? There was a delay in the flight. Who's that? The shift manager in the coffee shop. You're kissing the shift manager in public? He's got a car. You're kissing him because he's got a car? No, he's lovely. Come. Brian, this is my friend Lara. How are you Lara? Brian. Sure feels like I bleedin' know ye already. Inam has been tellin' me Everythin' about you, she is so excited, thrilled to bits that you're over here in the UK, Y' know, it's brilliant, anyway... You girls catch up, I'll take these to the car park. What did he say? Irish. Is that all you brought? You were drinking the entire flight, weren't you? You're drunk. I can smell it. Shut up. I know you're awake so stop pretending. Who was at the door? A friend. Come on, get up, you'll be late. I hate that job. Speak English! Fuck off! Speak English!... what took you so long and what's with the lipstick? Look at my hands, just look at them. Stop biting them, it's nothing to do with your job, you have a great job. You'd probably stick to making cappuccinos until your brain dries out. Hot cafe... My fuckin' ass! I hate... it's simply not me, I hate being... Subservient. - Subservient. Just found it today, look, "overly submissive, docile, dutiful" "obedient, a person working under authority of another" The English are bigger slave drivers then the Jews, They're just more polite about it. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Good evening, Mr. Johnson. Well, as you... err... this morning the... Today we'll be discussing the issue, the contentious issue... Did you wash behind your ears? Yes. Inside and outside around and about? You better not lie boy or potatoes will sprout! I thought I told you to wait downstairs. I came up to see the boy. What's your name, little boy? His name is James. James, James, James. Come on, lets go. You coming? Yeah, Coming. Are you going to be staying with us? No, honey, she's going home soon. I just arrived. Did you lose anything? Yes, my mobile phone... I'm not sure where I left it. Crap, where the hell is my phone? Excuse me. Your mother wants me to go. Are we done yet? Nice car... Yours? Yes, mine. No, Michael's. My husband's got something a little smaller but it's almost brand new. Your husband?! You've seen my husband, haven't you? I didn't know you got married. Of course, you didn't know. How could you know! When did you get married? Two years ago in November. I'm almost sure I have a picture of him. Oh, I'm so disorganized. This is Aaron. Aaron? - Nice isn't he? Yeah, nice. Bit wrinkled... the photo I mean. He's very nice. He's not that nice, Lara. He's teeth are a bit yellow but he's loaded. You got what you wanted. As did you. I really need to find a man soon, before I'm too old, too ugly and nobody wants me for my body anymore, just for my brains. Can you just imagine? It's never going to happen. Why? You're too sexually attuned. "Sexually attuned"... Nice English, Lara. Yeah, okay. I'm not sexually attuned. Really, I'm not. I'm unhappy, maybe even depressed. For me sex is what alcohol is for you. A sorry little sedative. Is that English good enough for you, madam? You've given up on love, haven't you? Yeah. No, maybe, don't know. You've got one man who likes you a lot. Yeah, I've got a man. Do you love him? Of course I don't. So? So, he's a good guy. Very good guy. - Yeah. British. I mean, Italian British. Uh huh. Un-circumcised. Can be fixed. - Yeah, right. If I get him to do that he's going to feel I owe him, and so NO! If you don't love him why bother? Who said I don't love him? - You did. No, I didn't. - Yes, you did, you just did. Right, I don't know... I just don't want to end up being married to a boring mediocre English teacher on a basic salary. He'd be perfect for you, though. Thanks. - Sorry, I didn't mean it that way. How did you mean it then? I mean I will never be able to give him what he wants. I need a drink. You have your flask... have another sip. Fuck off! You treat me like air. But good air. I got to take in all your inner thoughts, all your contemplations about men, and life and love but I'm never included. Our relationship is nothing to you. You don't give a morning piss about what I feel for you. I hear ye... What do you want me to do? I want you to love me and be with me. I don't want to lose you to a man. I doubt very much a man would ever really want me. Again we're talking about you. - Sorry. We're talking about me for a change. Sorry. You've got everything. I've got nothing. I'll die sick and lonely and get buried in a poor Palestinian graveyard. They have Palestinian graveyards in London? -They have Palestinian everything in London, just like Jews. - Jeez, you're such a whiner. Yeah, I am. I'm just feeling sorry for myself when there are millions of people who would absolutely love to be me. I live in the most expensive city in the world, rent is outrageous, public transport is never cheap, same goes for food, definitely for alcohol and guess what, those idiots from the British council are paying for all of it. Voila. Can't I see how lucky I am or would I rather go back to Ramallah? Got it!... You deserve to have what ever you want. Then how come I can't have you? What? - Nothing. You were looking at something... - No, nothing, nothing! Is it still far to the boy's school? No. What are you doing? - There's more room back here. I've managed to save this from your mother's fridge. Take it. Thanks. You might want something sweet after lunch. Hi. - Hi. Fresh blueberries from the fruit-stand downstairs. Thank you, mister Johnson. Please, Lara, you've known me long enough. Right, sorry... Michael. There y'go. Inam is not here. May I come in? Yeah. - Thank you. Is there something wrong with her? No... wrong? Don't be upset. She likes you. Really. In fact, she likes you a lot. But what can you do... she has this need for... Other men? Maybe. Other men! Would you like a drink? Yes, I wouldn't mind one. Inam keeps some vodka under the pillow... There you go. Thank you. You want to sit? Thank you. Have a seat. Does she go out every night? Some nights she doesn't even come back. Did she tell you she can't have children? No. She can't have children. Which is no big deal, really, because she thinks that children are a waste of time anyway. She didn't tell me that. She did tell you about the other men, no? Yes, she did. She didn't tell me about you though. What about me? I saw you two kissing on the boat. You know, I was wondering, Lara, why did you tell me what you just did about Inam? Are you trying to drive me away from her? No, not at all... no! Then why would you tell me all this, I mean, she's meant to be your friend, why would you want to make her look bad? I wouldn't... No, I... I love Inam very much. She's my friend. It's not what you think. I keep telling her... I keep telling her "I don't want to love you this way" but she wouldn't listen. I want a family... get married, have children. May I have some more? You shouldn't be drinking so much. You're the Muslim, maybe it's you who shouldn't be drinking so much. Cheers. Cheers. I'm sorry, I... I shouldn't have done that, I'm sorry. No, stay. Don't go. I shouldn't have said that, but I did. What followed was, perhaps, just as much an accidental twist of fate as it was a carefully devised plot. Come on, don't forget your bag. Hello, Mrs. Johnson, good morning. - Hello, Good morning. Hi, James. - Hello. Bye bye. Why did you come? It's your birthday. Do you need any money? Now you're insulting me. Then what do you want? I just wanted to see you, that's all. You don't even come to visit anymore. No... yes. Yes what? Yes, I'm sorry, I know, I should. Anyway, I have to run back home. Someone's supposed to come fix the dishwasher. Oh, the dishwasher man. Yeah, I'll drive you back home. Oh no, no, no, please, don't. I've been enough of a burden. Just drop me off near a bus stop, I'll be fine. There's one right there. Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. I missed you. That's all. Oh, by the way... I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? From who? What do you mean from who? My husband, Aaron, who did you think, stupid? I'm a good girl now. Oh, I'm really happy for you. Really. I know you are. Thanks. Bye bye. Bye. What's she thinking now? What does she remember? Do I really want to know? This endless back tracking always takes me back to the same place. Inam, don't forget your homework tomorrow. Yes, Sister Lombardi. And stop smoking! You're not impressing anyone, young lady! Yes, sister Lombardi. "You're not impressing anyone, young lady"... She sure knows what she's talking about. Lara, I'll see you later, OK? But you said... hang on a minute... Change of plans. Don't worry, I'll come by later. Jamil, can you - Yes, I'll put it on the tab. Tell your dad he needs to settle the bill. Lara, the Lemonade. - Thank you. Lara, where have you been? Weren't you supposed to come with Inam? I made a birthday cake for you. You angry with me? You forgot my birthday. No, I didn't. I told you I'll come. We were supposed to come here together after school... You're right. I'm sorry. Are you serious about your plan? Of course I am. What about the curfew? Curfew's at eight. We got four hours. Four hours is not enough. You're scared. Scared? It's the headache of avoiding the check-points and then walking and walking. You didn't mind the headache of walking with those boys... If you think I don't know you followed me, you're wrong. Right, then. Get dressed. Lara, sweetie, come here. Happy Birthday. Thanks, Daddy. Lara, don't forget the curfew! Leave her, she's old enough. Curfew is at eight! Be quiet and get a job! Ok, ok, you don't have to yell. Bye, Lara. Don't forget the curfew! OK. Inam? Why are you so late? Where were you? What did you do with my purse? Why is it open? Did you steal money from here? No. - Did you steal money? I said no! - What's in your hand? Lipstick. -You know how hard it is to get this shit? Hello. Hello... If you touch my purse again I'll break your face! I told her I just took lipstick. Nice? Yes. Very. Want some? You OK? Yeah. This time it only cost me a crushed jaw. She's a complete lunatic. No wonder my dad ran off. OK. Lets go. Just put on anything. We don't have time. What's better... This or this? That one. Which way are we taking? We can cut through the old army base. Hello, could you give us a lift to the check-point? Sure. - Thanks. Listen carefully. We are tourists from Italy, from Rome. We are staying with our stupid Jewish aunt Shoshana Lombardi. We're staying at Moriah street. 47 Moriah street. 47 Moriah street. - Yes, 47 Moriah street. 47 Moriah street. Could you drop us off before the checkpoint? Thank you. Goodbye. We need to hurry so we don't get caught. I'm so hungry. We have enough money for popcorn. Popcorn? Are you kidding? I'm so fat! True. True?!... True!? Stop it, Inam! What are we seeing? We're stuck with Mel Gibson. Nice. I love Mel Gibson. I'm not sure I remember exactly what happened later that night. It's certain that there is not one absolute clear way of looking at what indeed happened. Didn't you say the dishwasher man was supposed to come? How did you get in? I've been here for almost an hour but didn't see any dishwasher man. How the hell did you get in? Through the window. What?! I should've let you take me home. It's pissing down. Anyway... I think I know where your phone is. Did you do that? Yeah, sorry, I must've knocked it in by mistake. By mistake?! Yeah, I called Aaron - Aaron? I told you, my husband. You called your husband, then dropped the phone in the fish tank? I said I was sorry, it was an accident. Anyway, I called Aaron... he's gonna come and pick me up soon, I gave him your address. Sorry about the phone, you must be angry. Angry?... Why should I be angry? You're the one who's supposed to be angry. I just wish you'd tell me what the hell you want from me. Crap, look at me. I just got this dress. Think I can have a quick bath? If its alright... I'm freezing. Now what?! Jeez, you're such a grouch! It's only a bath! You specifically asked me before if I needed anything, didn't you? I thought that as long as I'm waiting here I might as well have a quick bath and dry this out so I don't catch anything. If you're going to go all stroppy on me then forget it. Okay, fine, but if your husband isn't here in half an hour I'll drive you back myself. Thanks. Here you go. - Thanks. Come on, lets go. We need to hurry. It's past curfew and we're late. Look. It's the Israeli soldiers from inside. Stop staring at them. You're attracting attention. How am I going to fall in love if I don't attract attention? Do you have to fall in love here? Maybe you're right. Too bad. They're so cute. Jewish, but cute. Quit smiling at them! Just keep your mouth shut. Good evening, girls. You were in the cinema, weren't you? Sorry, we don't speak Hebrew. Oh, tourists! - Yes. We're from Italy. Italy... Viva Italia. Ti amo, Amore, Lamborghini, Ferrari. Okay. Okay, okay, I'm sorry, Not funny. I'm sorry. It's okay. So... welcome to Israel. Thank you. So... did you like the movie? Yes, we did. Good movie? Yes... err... we really have to go now. We're staying with our aunt and she'll get worried if we're late. Where does she live, your aunt? Moriah street, why? Because we thought maybe you can come with us, we can have a drink, and then we can walk you home. You know what, you can invite your aunt to come with us too, It'll be fun. It's okay, maybe some other time. You sure? - Yes. OK. - Good night. -Good night. You sure you don't want to? Man, she is cute. - Yeah. Let's go. Oh God, Inam... They're following us. Why did you have to talk to them? They started talking so I answered. I was polite. I can't believe you did that. Will you relax? You're such a chicken. I should've known taking you here was a bad idea. Why are you stopping? Relax. I think I know how to handle this. You're following us. Yes. Why? Because you look very nice. Okay, thank you. I'm Boaz. I'm Gadi. Hi. I'm Sofia, and this is my sister Marcella. Pleased to meet you, but we really have to go. But... but, Sofia... Sofia! It's not fair. - Why? It's not fair because Marcella didn't shake my hand. We really have to go. No, no, no... why? - Good night. You don't get it do you? - What do you mean? Hey, it's not polite to speak in a language we don't understand. So sorry. We didn't mean to be rude. It's okay. We better go. Why? - Good night. Wait a second... Let me talk to her. Where did you say you live? I told you. Tell me again. Moriah Street, if you must know, and get that stupid smile off your face. Lets go. You always ruin it for me when I hit it off with a girl. Wait... I thought you said Moriah street. Yes, so? Moriah street is that way. Oh... thank you. Your accent, it's not really Italian, is it? What? You're not Italian? And you know that we can ask you for an ID. What ID? What are you talking about? Be quiet, will you. And you probably don't have an ID, right? No, we don't have an ID. What's the matter? You're afraid I'm carrying a bomb and I will explode in your stupid movie theatre? Ah, mister big strong Israeli soldier. You Jews are so afraid, you're so afraid all the time. "Oooh, I'm so afraid"... Boom! I don't know if he's dumb or just playing dumb. Let's go, we're going to get into trouble. Oh, man, now I get it. I'm such a dummy. -You are such a dummy. So, what we do now? Come with me. Wait, wait... who come with you? He come with you or I come with you? Shut up, man. Gadi, where are you going? Gadi, leave it. Why? She's cute, this one. You'll get in trouble, man. What the hell are you doing? It won't take long. Don't worry. It's past curfew! Gadi, are you crazy? Gadi! Gadi, I'm leaving. I'm not waiting for you. Not so fast. Why not? I don't... I don't know. What's the matter? I don't know. So... what now? Have you ever done this before? I did, and you? It's okay. What? Nothing, I just thought you... You thought I was stealing, didn't you? No, no... not at all. Okay, borrowing then, or did you just want to see me naked? What's wrong, Lara? Tell me. You're not thinking about... No, I'm not thinking about anything. Good. Now, run along and let me finish my bath. Hi. -Hi. You're here for the dishwasher? - Yeah, yeah, How're you doin'... Alright? - Good. -Good, good, good. Come in. The kitchen is that way. If you wanted a dress you could've just asked. Who was at the door? The repairman, I told you. The dishwasher is broken. So there really was one coming. I thought you made him up just to get rid of me. Could you please not stretch the fabric like this. Dunno... the bust is so loose. You have such huge boobies. You still breast feed your son? Why the hell would I do that? You're his mother. He's seven! So? So, you have to be either misinformed or a little soft in the head to get a seven year old to do that. So what are you saying? I'm saying, don't be ridiculous! I suppose you need some clean underwear. I don't use underwear. You have to be either misinformed or a little soft in the head to use any. Very funny. Besides, it saves on laundry and keeps me ready for Freddy. Slut. What? Every time you kiss me I feel you're just... Just what? Playing with me. - Why? Because that's what you do. You keep saying that. Well, it's true. You THINK it's true! Why would I think it's true if it wasn't? -Because that's what you do. Right, right. But I still love you. See, you're playing with me. We've been over this a million times! Yes, we have. You're playing with me... you're playing with me just like you used to play with your men, with your sex and boobs. You need to hit me over the head with this every time I see you, don't you? Hit you over the head with what? Lara, I'm so happy that we're still friends after all these years. You are the only person who's been there for me, the only person who's waited... - Hit you over the head with what? With the fact that I never loved you back. Oh no, you can't pull that one anymore, you little shit. Not anymore. I don't believe those tears for a second. Just look at you. You're lonely, you're sad and you're getting uglier by the day. I don't give a flying fuck whether you love me or not. Not anymore. I'm going down to show the repairman what to do. Could you please pick up your things from the bathroom and come down when you're done? Yeah, sure. Good. Hi. Where were you? You didn't come home last night, you didn't come the night before. I was worried about you. I'm moving out. Moving out? Why? Where? I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? From who? You never have sex. From Michael. Let me pull this out, we need to have a look at the back. Shall I give you a hand? No, it's fine, you can hold it if you want so it doesn't fall on my head. I'm holding it. Rusty, isn't it? Yeah. People do all sorts of things. Some are kind, graceful, others are not. Some are cheery, rational, others are not. I'll replace the pipe underneath I think I've got a spare filter in the van, I'll be right back. - Thank you. I'm not sure I can tell who is what anymore. I don't understand. What? Mrs. Johnson, you're back already? Back?... What are you talking about? Where's my son? Your sister just picked him up a few minutes ago, she said you were going to be late and asked her to pick him up She's not my sister! She was with you this morning, I didn't even think - is anything wrong? Shit. Mrs. Johnson, is anything wrong? Where would you like to go? Do you want to go to the zoo? To the park? Do you want some ice cream? Where's my mum? You need to change gear. Oh, absolutely. You're in the wrong gear, you're going to ruin the engine. -OK. Can you show me how to do this? I don't know how, I just... you got to change gear! OK, OK... right. Hey, where did you say you live? I told you. - Tell me again. Moriah street, if you must know. And I don't appreciate your tone of voice. Goodnight. Let's go. - I thought you said Moriah street... Yeah, so? Moriah street is that way. Yes... we know, we have to go somewhere else before we go home. Somewhere else? - Yes. Where somewhere else? Jenin?... Ramallah? What do you want? My friend asked you nicely to come with us and have a drink. You said no. Why did you say no? You got an ID? Quit bugging her. - Shut up, Boaz, let me handle this. Miss, do you have an ID? No, we don't have an ID. Happy now? That's not good. I don't speak Hebrew. You don't speak Hebrew? No, I don't speak Hebrew Did you hear that, Boaz? Suddenly Miss Italian tourist doesn't speak Hebrew. Do you have to be an asshole? Excuse me, you can go home now, OK? Goodnight. If you want to see a movie go to Ramallah, you piece of don't speak Hebrew! What's the matter, huh? You're afraid I'm carrying a bomb and I will explode in your stupid movie theatre? Huh, Mr. big strong Israeli solider? You Jews are so afraid, you're so fucking afraid! Oooh, I'm so afraid... boom! Hey, Gadi leave her alone! - Shut up, she's got a big mouth. You want to see a movie, I'll show you a real movie! Gadi, you're nuts! Give me your fucking ID, if you don't give me your ID I'll take an ID from her! - No, leave her alone. You don't tell me what to do! Gadi!... Gadi, Stop! Boaz, get out of my way I'm fuckin' warning you! Hey, hey, please, it's okay, everything is okay. No problem, I'm sorry... Okay? You want to go and have a drink, right? All of a sudden you're nice. Come with me. Listen, you don't have to do anything. It's okay. - You don't have to do anything! It's okay, go away, go away. I don't need your help! They only understand force... Gadi!... - Inam, please, let's go. Gadi, I'm reporting you! Report what? - Report that you're a shithead. No one's going to believe you, Boaz. - I don't care, Gadi. Lara, go home. Go home. Go home. Go home already. Hey, hey, not so fast. Why not? I don't know. You want to take this jacket off? Lift your dress. Will you let us go afterwards or not? Maybe. You want to take this off? Turn around. You know you're not allowed to leave here without permission, I could get fired for what you did, I don't want to have to restrain you again. Here, take your vitamins. Stop calling this shit vitamins. Who did you nick the dress from? Your hair needs a trim. Maybe we could sort it out tomorrow. Yolanda, phone, your office. Hello. Yes, okay, tell her I'll be right down. Aaron? Aaron? - Yeah... Here she is. Hello, Mrs. Johnson. Hi, how are you? I'm good, how are you? I'm good, thank you. - It's good to see you. Well, we did have a bit of an upset with Inam today. She came over to my house again. I thought she might. I'm sorry, we did try and call you on your mobile but it was turned off all day. I'd like to see her. She's back now and she seems perfectly fine. We do try and keep a close eye on her but you know what she's like. She's better, a lot better than she was when you first brought her here and she's doing well, she's doing very very well. She took a dress from a patient today... I may have ended up living a different life. I may have even liked it. But it doesn't matter anymore. This is my life. I might as well live it. No questions asked.
