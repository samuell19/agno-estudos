(audience applause) - Can I get you some oxygen? - No thanks doc. - How about a little mouth to mouth between shows? - What are you trying to do? Kill me. - Well can you think of a better way to go? (audience applause) (jazz dance music) - Alright, lights out. (mumbling) (audience applause) - Say Heidi, want to get some Indian food? - No, I'm just gonna hang here between shows and rest. - Are you okay? - Just the usual monthly blessing. - Well, can I bring you something back? - No thanks, I just need a nap. (whistling) - Nick. Do you want to get something to eat? - Actually I have a doctor's appointment. Sorry. - Why now? - Maybe it's a joke? - [Woman] How I'm gonna afford my condo payments? - [Second Woman] Suicide party after the show. - That's crazy. - [Third Woman] It's a closing notice. - Bullshit! (yelling at the same time) - Alright! That's it, I'm over this scene. The show's closing, you both know what's coming, let's get down to business. - Oh come on, we have to tell him-- - Yeah, I'll tell him-- - Hello? Don't play dumb with me. Listen, we're all in this together. Out with the plastic. - Oh come on Sean, you're not serious. - Alright, listen. Take out your credit cards, keep one for ID and pass the rest to the left. Honey, it's too painful to do it yourself. - The Gap is going to go bankrupt. - In the name of Lord & Taylor, Saks and Bloomies, forgive me, for I have sinned. - Where have you been? - Talking with Nick. - We're closing. - Good. I was getting sick of this show anyway. - Did you hear? I can't believe this shit. - Time to head up, huh Nick. - What do you think? (slow jazzy music) - Hi there! - [Nick] Hey, what is it this time? - Rock hard buns. - Are we having fun? - We are now. - Rock hard buns, mwah. Sounds like a porno movie. - We can make it into one. - [Nick] Great, I'll get the camera. - How was the show? - Good, except for one thing. We closed. - Oh baby, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah, it's no big surprise, the audience really fell off after the holidays. - Well you got a good run out of it, almost a year. - Yeah, I guess. - So what's the plan? - Find a new show. - Remember how long it took you to find this one. - That wasn't my fault. - I know, just Broadway seems to be dying this slow death. - They've been saying that ever since I got here and I did okay. - You kidding, you did great. - I would just hate to see you hang on for too long and then break down like I did. - I'll know when my time is up. - Well I'll be there for you, like you were for me. And then, we can start thinking about what's next. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Stop playing house. - To what do I owe this pleasure? - Business, not pleasure. I just came to drop off some pictures and resumes. - Still got plenty. - [Nick] Well that's not a good sign is it? - Things have been really slow. - Well that's why I'm here. - Sorry to hear about your show. - Yeah, it's time for a new one. - I'll see what I can do. - I was hoping you could be a little more helpful than you were the last time. - Look, I don't need to tell you there's no work for dancers. I don't even sign them anymore, there's no money in it. All my theater clients are bust unless I get them a film or a TV gig. - Just get me the auditions, I'll do the rest. - What about acting? I mean you have a good look. I thought you should try acting when you got too old to dance. - I'm not too old to dance. - Of course not. - Morning Rolly. - What's so good about it Skinny? - How's my schedule look? - Not too bad if you make it through your first appointment. The doctor wants to see you. - What for? Is he mad? - I don't know nothing. - Now. - As soon as he's through with his patient. Nice looking guy too. See if I can get you a date. - [Heidi] Hey! - Hi. How are you. - Good. - How come you not dressed? - What's the rush, we've got all day. - No, we're gonna need all day. The unemployment office is a day-long drive. Come on. - Let's go tomorrow. - No, we've got to go to the office and check the call book for auditions. Come on. - When's my time? - I don't know. Maybe tomorrow. - And what if your wife takes it all out of you tonight? (kettle whistling) (sighs) - For the last time, she's not my wife. - Yeah, but you must be common law by now. - What are you so pissed off about? - Well it's a toss up between getting fucked over by you and not being able to afford my rent. - Whoa, whoa! Who told you to get such an expensive apartment. Did you think this show was going to run forever? - [Heidi] I got tired of living in a dump. - Have you thought about moving? - Have you? - What! In here! Come on. - I don't know why I even bother. - Listen, I don't need this shit right now okay. My agent blew me off this morning and now Amy's dropping hints about the future. - What do you want? - I want to dance, forever. - Get real Nick. What are you going to do when you can't dance anymore? Have you thought of that? Well I can't wait around for you to figure this out. Guess I'm going to have to let Steven move in. He needs a place to live. - Yeah, and how long before he comes creeping into your bedroom at night? - None of your fucking business. - Oh I thought we had an understanding. - Yeah, well now it's a misunderstanding. My soap's on. - I'll call you okay. - When you get a divorce. - How do you expect me to get you a man when you dress like an old washerwoman. - I already got a man. - Girl I don't see no ring on your finger. - You will soon. - From who? That dancer boy that just lost his job? - He'll get another one. - No, you're breaking Miss Rolanda's first rule of relationships. - And what's that? - Never go with a man who makes less money than you. - There are plenty of nice men who don't happen to make a lot of money. - Well why you think they're being so nice. - Nick isn't like that. - What does that guy do that makes you so blind girl? (giggling) No he don't. - Yes he do. - Ooh. Leave everything to me. - I don't see any ring on your finger. - Well that's because I keep giving them back. - I'll keep my eye out for you. - Okay, now, you do that Skinny. But, make sure he's a brother. Mama don't let me date no white boy. - Hey Nick, you're here early. Anything interesting? - How does dinner theater in Jersey grab you? I thought so. How about you? - Actually I'm looking for an apartment. - Really, you know Heidi's looking for a room mate. - Ooh, can I live with Miss Thing? - So what happened with you and Kevin? - He kicked me out, he accused me of cheating on him. - Nobody's perfect. - Yeah, don't we know it. Aaah. - [Dr. Astin] How about Fairfield, Connecticut? - Connecticut? - I am expanding my practice and I'm opening an office in Fairfield later this year. I need somebody out there I can rely on to help supervise the staff while I'm in the city. - I don't know what to say. - There's just one thing. It comes with a raise in pay. - This is wonderful. - Think about it and get back to me. - Hey Frankie how are you doing? - How are you? - Nicky. What'll it be? - Two slices please. - Stay here? - Yeah, with a coke. - What are you doing out on a day like this? You should be inside keeping one of them skinny dancers warm. - There ain't enough meat on those broads to put on a slice of pizza. - So what are you doing these days? - Eh, my show just closed. - Sorry to hear. - So it's gonna be a little less steak, a little more pizza from now on huh? - Yeah, I should buy stock in this joint. - Don't worry, something will come up. - Don't it always. - Depends how long you've been married. - Don't look at me. - Lie down sir. I see you tore the medio-collateral ligament of your left knee. How did it happen? - Running. - Oh are you a jogger. - No, I was chasing a cab and I caught a pothole. - Well, it could have been a lot worse. You're lucky to be alive. - Really. - Yeah, you might have caught that cab. I'm gonna take a few measurements of your knee flexibility so we can monitor your progress and then I'll give you a series of exercises that you can do at home. - By the way I'm Peter Shepherd. - Oh, I'm sorry. Amy. Where you from? - I'm from Iowa. - [Amy] Farm boy. - No my father was a professor. What brings you to New York? - Money. - Oh. - Other people's money. I'm an investment analyst. - I'm embarrassed to admit I don't really understand much about that stuff. - [Peter] Most people don't. - [Amy] I'm not hurting you am I? - No. - Okay turn over. Are you alright? - Yeah, it's just, yeah. - Try and touch your heel into your backside. - Whoa. - Let's go back. Okay, turn over and we'll start on your exercises. - You know my knee does kind of hurt a little bit. Do you think I could just relax here for a second? - Sure, can I get you something to drink. - Yeah, that will be great. - I'll get you some cold water. (answering machine beeps) - [Woman] Hi, I have Alex calling for Nick Mendez. Please return the call when you get this message. (dialing tone purrs) Railway talent. - Hi Nick Mendez for Alex please. - [Woman] Sure hold a moment. - Nicholas how are you. - Fine, what's up. - [Alex] I have an audition for you. - For what? - Gangland. - Really! That's great. - It's gonna be huge Broadway revival. Hopefully it's going to have a nice long run. - Beautiful. Is Austin Gibson directing? - [Alex] How did you know? - Yeah, he's the man. - [Alex] Have you worked for him before? - Slaved for him is more like it. - [Alex] Terrific, then you'll probably get the job. - Yeah, he loves me. - Listen, uh Nick. I got you the shot, but I don't really see a future for us, so from now on you're on your own. - Oh. - [Alex] Have a nice life. - Yeah thanks. Asshole. Connecticut! What the hell am I going to do in Connecticut? Work at a Dairy Queen? (chuckles) What's so funny? - You working with those brassy breeze machines with a pointy white hat on. - Don't start with me. - [Amy] You know how I love a man in uniform. - Cup or cone? Sprinkles on that miss. - Relax Nick, I just told him I'd think about it. So what's your good news? - Oh, I'm going to be back on Broadway. - Really? In what? - Gangland. Yeah, looks pretty good. Austin's directing. - That's fantastic. - Yeah, it's perfect timing. - You sure you can still pass for a teenage gang member? - Yes. Theater's all about illusions. - What should I tell Dr. Astin? This puts me in a weird position. - I don't know. - If you don't get the show, I'd like to try it out in Connecticut for a while. - I'll get the show. - Let's go and celebrate. (upbeat music) - Two for Mendez. - Right this way. - Hi can I get you something to drink this evening? - Yes, we'd like a bottle of Perrier joie de'fleur. - [Waiter] Yes sir. - Oh, is Louie in. - He's in the kitchen. - Would you tell him an old friend would like to say hello. - Sure. - Hey, hey, hey! This is a public place. - Hey Louie, how are you? - Good Nick. And Amy. - Hi. - You're looking thinner. - Oh the only thing thinner about me is my wallet. But you look as beautiful as ever. How come you don't stop by more often? - Who can afford these prices? - [Louie] What is the occasion? - We're celebrating Nick's new Broadway show. - More singing and dancing. Hey when you gonna settle down and make a honest woman of this girl. And when are you going to get a real job? - You could open a restaurant. - No, not a restaurant. Remember when he worked here. Headache after headache after headache. - Louie's right. - Nick why don't you stop by one afternoon and I'll kick some sense into you about this girl huh.

You seen anybody from the original cast. - No, I think they're all in wheelchairs by now. - (chuckles) So what are you doing here grandpa? - My nephew's first audition. I came along to help him out. This is Nick Mendez. He played Fernando in the original Broadway cast of Gangland. - How you doing? - I'll be back later. - That's the fourth time in 15 minutes. Before my first audition I was so nervous, I didn't want to leave the bathroom stall. I didn't even know if I want to take a piss, take a shit, or puke my guts out. - What happened? - All hell broke loose, all three at once. (speaking Spanish) (laughing) - Group one, group two, group two, group one, group one, group two, one, go group one, group one group two, group one, group two, group one, group two, group two, group one, group... Go in group two. One, one. Two. Okay, girls stay on the floor, boys off to the side. Lisa. Teach them the opening number. - Okay. (mumbling) (fingers clicking) - Six, seven, eight. Fingers out, out, out. - So I hear your show closed. - Yeah. Boy I was so relieved when I heard you got a show coming up. There's no work around. - Telling me. Fucking MTV's killing the dance business. Nothing left but a bunch of kids having sex to music. - [Nick] Time's change. - [Austin] So, how's your love life, how's Abby? - [Nick] Amy. - Abby, Amy. There's no keeping up with you. - Yeah well, we're still together. - Married? - Not yet. - You're not going to see the inside of a church till your own funeral. - You never know what could happen, could be sooner than you think. She just got a job offer in Connecticut. - Quiet up there. - Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of. - Good, okay. Girls off, boys on. Teach them the stakeout combination. - I'm gonna go over the steps at the back, alright. - Send Ramone over here. - And shaking the leg and around. - Hi. So I hope you're not here to audition. You're old enough to be one of these kids father. - Actually an uncle. I wanted to make sure that my nephew didn't end up in your casting couch. - Didn't want him following your footsteps? So how old is this kid? - He's 16. He's very good, he's excellent. Wonderful. - And brush forward, back left, and drop and turn. Drop and shake and hit and shake, shake, shake. - Hold it a second. Hold it a second. What's your name? - Julio. - Julio what? - Julio Rosario. - Where are you from? - Puerto Rico. - Are you ashamed of that? - No. - What was that? - No. - Not good enough. This combination is where your gang stakes out it's territory. You've had it with people pushing you around, you're pissed off. This is the street, not a fucking ballet studio. I don't care how high you kick your leg, it's a fight, not a dance. Nick, come over here. One time from the top. (intense music) (applauding) Number four and number six stay. Everybody else, thank you very much. One and number three. Okay, that's it for the day. Final call back is next week and thanks for the good work. Nick. I don't want to keep you hanging but I'm leaning with Steven for Fernando. - Why? - It's a young man's game Nick. You won't fit up there anymore. - Oh come on Austin, I really need the job. You know I'm the best man for the part. - On any given day sure. But you have to do eight performances a week. I don't know. - Look. All I'm asking for is a chance. Let me come to the call back. - Okay. - Thanks. - You can't give it up can you? - No way. - Oh you sore? - Yes. (groaning) - I'm glad your audition went so well. You deserve it. - Ow. (groaning) - Back for more torture. - It's payback time. - Everything you ever wanted to know about stocks and bonds but were afraid to ask. - Sounds stupid, but it's pretty helpful. - Thank you. Go ahead and lay down. - Sure is a pain hopping around the city on crutches. - I know, I've been there. - [Peter] You had knee surgery? - Three times. - Ow. What happened? - I kept trying to dance, but my knees said no. - Ow, ow, ow! You were a dancer. - All my life. - You miss it? - Always will. - It's good you found something to fall back on I guess. - I was lucky, by the time I went back to school I knew more about physical therapy than most of my teachers. Sometimes when you dance for too long you start to think it will never end. Then one day it's just over. - Must have been hard to give up. - It's for the best. I'm proud of you. - No big deal, we could use the money. It's just until Gangland comes through. (easy listening music) (people chatting and laughing) So what do you do when you're not working here? - I study acting. - Really? What a coincidence. - You're an actor? - Well no I'm a dancer, but my agent said I should start taking acting classes. - Guess you can't dance forever. - So people have been telling me. You want to go out for a drink. I mean you can recommend some acting teachers to me. - Well, it's late. I have an early rehearsal. - You performing somewhere? - No, it's a student study class. - Have you ever worked professionally, in front of an audience. - No, have you? - There's nothing like it. - So I hear. - Oh. Veronica. I'm rehearsing for a call back. (yelling) Frankie. - Hey. - Two slices, could ya. Oh. Jesus Christ, did you see this? Taylor wants the Yankees to pay him $10 million a year. - Yeah and they gonna pay the asshole. At the end of the season they're still going to be in the shit house. - Yeah, I should have never quit playing ball. If I had been the worst player in the league I could've made more money in one year than my whole fucking dance career combined. - What are you crazy? Listen to me, baseball players are done at what, 35. Basketball, 30. Football players, forget about it, those assholes age every game. You want to put up with price, please. You got a new job yet? - Just for now I'm babysitting over at a yuppy cafe. - Oh yeah. No more Mr. Show business. - Well I got a Broadway show coming up. - Oh, that's good. That's good. - 'Scuse me. Is your manager here? - Hey Nick, someone here for a job. (speaking Spanish) - What can I do for you? - I would like to know if you have any open jobs. - You mean job openings. - Oh yeah, sorry. - It's okay. Hold on, let me get you an application. Ow. Hmm, here you go. - Thank you. - Wait a minute. Why don't you take a seat. - Thank you. - So do you have any restaurant experience? - Yes in a cafe. - Where? - In Paris. - Oh, just your name and number should be fine. Er, you might have to start out as a hostess, is that okay? - That's fine. - Alright. Then, can you come by tonight and start training? - Tonight? At what time? - Seven. - It's perfect. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you very much. - Alright, I'll see you tonight. - Okay, Bye bye. - Bye bye. - Bye the way Michelle, what brings you to New York? - I'm a dancer. - Really, that's great. - See you tonight. - What? Okay, so I have a soft spot for struggling dancers. - It looks like it's hard from here. (laughing) - Good evening, may I help you? - Yes, table for two please. - Would that be smoking or non-smoking? - Non-smoking please, we both have allergies. - We have to get to the theater by eight o'clock and honey not near a draft. I don't want my husband to catch cold. - Excuse me one second. They don't have a reservation. - Hmm, seat them in 16. If they don't like it, it's going to be a long wait. - Nick. What a surprise. - Hi. - Nick, this is David. David, Nick. - Do you have a reservation. Two, at seven. For Filmer. - Show these folks to table nine. Enjoy. - One salmon filet, sauteed. No butter, no oil, a side of steamed vegetables, no salt. And for you, one grilled tuna steak. No honey mustard with a well done baked potato with cottage cheese instead of cream. And then two caesar salads, no croutons, no eggs, no anchovies and the dressing on the side. - So where do you know that guy from? - We danced together on a show. - Cause things seemed a little tense, like there was something else going on. - Gimme a break, we're not in a courtroom. - I was just trying to get to know you better. - He's probably just embarrassed to have me see him working in a restaurant. - Dancers have a tough life. - Look, you've got nothing to worry about, he's married. - I thought you said that all the guys you worked with were gay. - I said most of them were. - Yeah, well, the rest are just guilty by association. - No, the rest are busy fucking their brains out. - The girl from table nine would like to speak with you when you get a chance. Friend of yours? - [Nick] Yeah, we did a show together. - On Broadway. Really? - Hmm mm. - Think I'm going to make it some day? - It depends on how good you are, I'd have to see you dance. - So lets take a class together. - Miss, I'm afraid this fish has to be cooked more. - You can get very sick from eating raw fish. - You ever hear of sushi? - What they say? - Rich and total assholes. - Did they call you about the Broadway softball league? - Yeah. - [Heidi] You gonna play? - Well I'm thinking of holding out for a bigger contract. - Well I'll negotiate it. - Table 16 wants to speak to the manager. - Excuse me. - Look at this fish. I sent it back to be cooked after it had been served practically raw. - We didn't come here to eat sushi. - On behalf of the management I apologize for your inconvenience this evening. And would like to offer you each a complimentary coffee and dessert. - Well, isn't that nice. - I'll send your waitress right over. - Oh please no. That young lady was so rude. She's got some fresh mouth on her. (gentle music) - Owen, I want you to meet a friend of mine. This is Michelle. - Hello. - Welcome. - This is her first time in your class, don't be too rough on her. - Anything this old retread told you about me doesn't contain an ounce of truth. - [Nick] Actually I told her you were a little pussy cat. - You're a bigger liar than I thought. Just relax, enjoy yourself. - Thank you. - And right, left, right, left. Three seconds and up. And second and up. Stretch left, one, two, three, four and left, right, left, right... Up and over, one, two, three. Use all eight counts. Five, six, seven. Straighten the hips out. One, two, and three, four up to, flat back, six. Keep the head in line by eight and upper diagonal. Lose the ballet arms and up to square by eight. And deb-oo-keh, two, three, four, five. Nick why don't you try using your turnout? - If I had it to begin with. - Two, three, that's because you're ass is too tight. - I'd be afraid to bend over round here if it wasn't. - You needn't worry. (upbeat music) (gentle music) Enjoying the scenery? - I'm focused, focused. - I heard you up for Gangland. - How'd you know. - Isn't it about time you thought about retiring your dance togs. - What, you want it for your collection. - I'm not interested in the wrapping, just the package. By the way, your friend Michelle. She's got good technique, she needs to loosen up. Too much ballet. (upbeat sexy music) - Wasn't that girl working with you in the restaurant the other night? - Yeah, she wants to be a Broadway star just like you. - She's too stiff. She moves like she's got a pole stuck up her ass. - Reminds me of David. - How's your wife? - Come on on the floor, come on. Next group, come on the floor, come on. Nick, what are you senile? Go over those steps. - I felt like such a spaz. - No, you did good for your first time. - Really? What do you think? Do I have what it takes? - You did really well, but we'll talk about it later, I got to go to work. - I got to go to work too. Can I change at your place? So what do you think? - [Nick] About what? - About me. I mean about my dancing. - Oh, yeah well, you've had a lot of ballet training right? - Since I was five. - Yeah, it shows. But if you want to become a jazz dancer you really have to forget the classical stuff and funk it up. - I felt so tense today and everybody looked like they were having such a good time. - Just relax. And work on your isolation. - Doesn't come naturally, I'm too white, I guess. - Well it's not something you're born with. It's actually something you have to work on. Come on, try this with me. Right just, do the isolation. (sexy jazzy music) (mumbling) ♪ Mmmm, I can't keep my eyes ♪ I can't my hands ♪ I can't keep myself off you ♪ I can't control my mind ♪ My hearts on fire ♪ I can't keep myself off you ♪ I can't get enough ♪ I'm going crazy ♪ I can't keep myself off you ♪ Hey - Saw your dance clothes in the laundry. - So? - Thought you might have had another audition. - No, just class. What's up? - What happens if you don't get the show? - I'll get the show. - I was thinking about Dr. Miller's offer and, if you don't get the show, I'd really like to try it out in the country for a while. - We'll talk about it after the call back, okay? - [Nick] Hey Scott. - Yo Nick, what's up. - Oh, by the way, have you done the schedule for next week? - No, not yet, why? - I'm having a little problem with Greta. - Really. She's our best waitress. - She is. It's just that I think she's burning out or something. I mean lately she's been bitchy towards some of the customers and I just don't want to see it become a bigger problem. - Well what do you suggest? - I don't know. Lighten her schedule. Drop a shift maybe. - Then who's going to take the shift. - I'd go with Michelle. - You think she's ready for that? - Yeah, yeah, I think she's ready for a move up. - Okay, I'll run it by Louie. - Thanks. - Congratulations, your knee is now even stronger than it was before the injury. - Thanks to you. - We'll call it a team victory. - How would one of the team members feel about going out to celebrate? - It's really sweet of you to ask. But I'm afraid it wouldn't be fair to you. I'm involved with someone. - I see. Figured I wasn't the only one in the world who thinks your special. But you weren't wearing a ring so I didn't know how serious it was. Sorry, just felt I had to ask. - No, I'm sorry. Some girl's going to be really lucky when you find her. (upbeat music) - [Nick] Sean, did I tell you Amy got a job offer in Connecticut. - [Sean] See ya, wouldn't want to be ya. - [Nick] How's it living with Heidi. - Quiet, she's always at David's. - So where's your new wannabe starlet? We could use another cheerleader around here. - She's at an audition, probably where you belong. - She's already got a job. - [Nick] Congratulations. - Yeah, it's no big deal, I'm stuck in the chorus again. - What show? - European tour of 42nd Street. - Understudying any roles? - Yeah, Anytime Andy. - Typecast again. - Oh! You're a real scream Mendez. Listen I'm looking to sublet my half of the apartment if you hear of anyone who needs a place. - Move in with this guy. - Preferably quiet, non-smoking, hunk of burning love. (cheering) - [Nick] Should've never quit playing ball, could've made some real money. - What makes you so sure you would have made it as a baseball player? - I made it as a dancer didn't I? - Yeah, big deal. How many guys go into dancing compared to baseball. The wife. That's your problem Nick. You've had it too easy. - Yeah right! That's my life, Easy Street, the whole way. - When's your call back? - Why? - Good luck Babe. - You wait! Your time will come and then you'll see it's no picnic. - I know, I know there's no solution to getting old. - [Amy] I'm at a patient meeting, I'll see you tonight. I love you. - I love you too. Thanks for calling. (mumbling) - Okay, this is the last time. What I want is intensity, but I also want control. (intense music) Nick! Cut it out! Cut it out right now! It was a tough decision, I'm sorry. - Me too. - [Austin] Hey, how about a job coaching these new kids during rehearsal. - I can still dance, you saw me. I'm not through yet. - Think about it. Maybe it's time to give something back. - I got nothing left to give. (mournful electric rock guitar music) (yelling) (answering machine beeping) - [Amy] Hey Nick, are you there? How did the call back go? I'm dying to find out, been thinking about you all day. Call me when you get in. Talk to you soon, bye. (doorbell buzzing) - [Nick] Who is it? - It's Michelle. I've got it. - Slow down. Got what? - I got the show. They only needed eight girls and I almost fainted when they called my name. - That's great. - Can you believe it. I'm going to Los Angeles for six months. - I hope you have a good time. - I will have a better time if you come with me. - I don't think that's going to happen. - At least come visit. I'll buy you a ticket. For everything you've done for me. - I haven't done anything. - Yes you did. I never felt confident before an audition. Today, I wasn't afraid to be sexy. I was getting into it. Come on Nick, another time. - You never give up do you. I'm wasted and we both have to go to work. - Oh come on. - Look, one of us still needs a job okay. Come on, hurry it up, we're late. - I'm coming. I can't find my makeup. - [Nick] Forget the makeup, let's go. Come on Michelle. - One second, I'm coming. - [Nick] Now. - Am I interrupting? - What is it honey? - I want to know why I was taken off my Friday night shift. - Nick thought that you were stressing out a little bit on the weekend rush and you were taking it out on some of the customers. And he named a few incidents. - A few incidents! No, it was one incident. And they were total nut jobs. If you had been here, you would have shown them the door. - You let me check this out with Nick. - And also, I don't think it's fair that Michelle got that shift. It took me six months to get onto that at night and she just showed up. - Is that true? - Yeah, Nick thought she could handle it. - I'm not here to spread rumors, but there's something going on with those two. I could care less, except for once Nick asked me out and I said no, I didn't think it was a big deal. But maybe it was for him. You know me Louie, I've given blood to this place, and I want that shift back. I don't want to have to take this to court. - I'll take care of this, I promise. - I'm sorry. I'm just so sick of getting screwed over. - Uh huh. Yeah, I understand. Right. Well I appreciate you taking the time. - Hey Nick. Have a seat. - What's up. - We've got a problem. - I'm sorry about this kid, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to let you go. - Why, what did I do? - In my book, nothing. But according to my lawyer, you may have sexually harassed one of our employees. - What? This is a joke right. - No. No joke Nick. - Can I ask you a question? Would you consider it sexual harassment if I bought you a drink? - No thanks. I'm waiting for someone. - No, no I'm not asking if you want a drink, though I'd be glad to buy you one. It's just that things are getting so confusing between men and women. Stuff that used to be okay isn't okay anymore. Do you know what I mean? - No, I don't know what you mean. Excuse me. - Aw, come on, you don't have to go away mad. Jesus Christ, I was just asking you a simple question. - Keep it down. - We got to communicate to get to the bottom of this thing. - Did you hear me, I said keep it down. - Hey come on. You ought to be on my side. We have to set some ground rules here or otherwise, we're going to be all fucked up. Doesn't anybody get it! - [Bouncer] Okay man, time to go. - Get your fuckin' hands off me. I said get your fuckin' hands off me. Who the fuck do you think you are? Dammit! Get your hands off me. - What are you doing here? - I live here. Where are you going? - Nowhere. You're the one who's leaving, right now. - What? - Don't play dumb with me. Since when have you started wearing lipstick. - Come on, don't jump to conclusions. - You didn't even have the decency to change our fucking sheets. I want you out of here, right now. - Stop yelling. Where do you expect me to go? - If your new slut won't take you in. You can sleep on the streets for all I care. Don't touch me. - Calm down. Look, I've had a lot to deal with today. I just got laid off from work. - That's good. That's just one more reason to throw your ass out. You are not sleeping here another out. If I have to, I will call the police and have them come throw you out. - Hi, it's me. I think I found someone to sublet your apartment. Yeah. Well, it's kind of an emergency. How about tonight? Yeah. Won't be long, I'm already packed. (operatic singing) - Wow! Whoo! You should be an opera singer. - Really, you think so? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Nick here? - He's in the bedroom. - How's he doing? - I don't know. I haven't seen him since he got here. - Come on, it's been two weeks. - I'm serious, he's the best room mate I ever had. It's like I'm living alone. - How do you know he's not dead? - Well when I come home, I can smell the distinctive odor of rotting pizza. (operatic singing) - I came by to pick up a few things. How long you going to keep this up. - As long as it takes. - For what? - I don't know. - Have you thought about how you're going to pay me the rent? - Don't worry. - I am worried. I can't cover for you and neither can Sean. - I'll get the money. - Not laying here without a job you won't. Look on the bright side, you saved yourself a divorce. - It's not over yet. - You move out to Connecticut, you're going to die a slow and pitiful death. You won't know what to do with yourself. You're better off jumping from a building. - It's crossed my mind. - It's weird. I used to hope this would happen. Break up with Amy, move in here. - Nah, you just needed somebody to pay the rent. - Don't sell yourself short. - You know the first time I met you, I knew you'd be good. You had a special quality. No! - You don't love David. - And you don't love me. Look, I need the rent money. And either you get it to me or I'll get someone else to move in, who can. And you'll be out of here. (mumbling) - Excuse me. My name is Nick, I was wondering if you were hiring. - Waiter or bartender. - Dancer. - Would you take off your shirt please. Would you turn around please. We don't have any openings for dancers right now. But we're always looking for good-looking waiters. - I'm not a waiter, I'm a dancer. $15. (women chattering loudly) - [Announcer] Ladies, please welcome, the world famous Beefcake Dancers. (woman screaming) (upbeat music) - What is this? A coffee shop? - Not even. Women don't know how to tip. - How do you make a living then. - After hours. - You don't mean... - Didn't you ever want to poke your favorite aunt. - I don't know. - Hey, I may be good for nothing, but I'm never bad for nothing. - How much do you charge. - Whatever it takes to get it up. I start at 100, go up 100 depending on her looks. Tonight however, I feel a little generous. (knocking) - I wasn't sure if you were coming. - Me neither. (woman moaning) - [Woman] You leaving so soon? - You not satisfied. - Well there's never too much of a good thing. - Well I won't be much use for the rest of the night. - Be fun, trying. - Maybe some other night. Maybe tomorrow night. If you're still in town and you think I'm worth the 50 bucks. - What? - I'm giving you a break since I had a pretty good time. - You think I need to pay for sex. - Too late now. - You never said anything about money. - That's life in the big city. - I'm not giving you anything. Now you get the hell out of here or I'm calling the police. (woman screaming) - Shut up! Shut up! (woman screaming) (tense music) (knocking) - [Amy] Who is it? - It's me. - What are you doing here. - [Nick] I lost my keys. - How'd you get up here then. - Oh come on. Amy, I need to talk. - No, not tonight. - Where am I going to go? Sleep on the streets. - Don't you have anywhere else you can go. - Three o'clock in the morning. Amy please. - Hold on a minute, I don't have anything on. What did you do to yourself? No! - Relax, I just need to talk. - Don't! I'm okay, just get dressed. - Yeah? - Yeah. (whispering) It's okay, he won't hurt me. - Are you leaving? - Yes, he's waiting for me downstairs. - Please. Don't go. He'll get over it. I'll never get over you. - It's too late. - I've learned my lesson. Things will be different. - It's not about the lessons that you learn it's about the one's that you forget. Over and over again. I can't take it anymore. - I love you. I love you. - Please don't. I have to go. I'm sorry. - No, no! (sobbing) - Ooh pizza. - [Delivery Man] No charge. - Oh great. Hey Skinny, your lunch is here. - I didn't order a pizza. - It's got your name on it, open it up, I'm starving. Mmm, smells like pepperoni. Sorry, sorry for what? - Because he couldn't be what I wanted him to be. What are you doing? - It's lunchtime ain't it. Mmm mmm mmm. Girl, you don't know what you're missing. - Yes I do. (slow gentle music) - Lean even more, lean more over. That's good. That's good. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Everybody hold it. I'm going to go have a cigarette and decide why I didn't become a flower arranger. Do me a favor, can you clean this number up before I strangle one of these kids. - Okay. - You sure you'll be okay. - Yeah. Okay. Come on, let's try it from the top alright. By the numbers, I really want to see pictures. Let's do it a little faster than usual. Take it from the three walks. Five, six, seven, eight and one, two. Yes, girls nice and low. Up, good. Steven, change to fourth position. Please. Okay. There you go. Alright, beautiful. Good, good. Hold it there for a second. Nice, there you go. Now come up. Good, good, that's much better. No, no, stop, stop! Hold on. That's okay, but you can't grab her like a piece of luggage. You have to treat her like a flower. Especially when you hold her. Hold her like she can't get away, but not too tight. Just tenderly. Watch this. What's your name? - Tatiana. - That's very good. - I know, it was nice. - Why don't you try it with Steven. Good, good. Alright, let's move it on. From the start, ready. Five, six, seven, eight, step. Bourree, bourree, bourree. And cut. Up. Up. Good. Very good. That's great. Let's try it one more time. Ready. Five, six, seven, eight. Bourree. Keep it together. Now, put the hip into it.
