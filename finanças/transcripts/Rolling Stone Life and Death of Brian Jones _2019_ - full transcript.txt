That really focused on this guy Brian Jones. You think of the Rolling Stones in the mid-60's and you think of Brian Jones. You don't think of Mick Jagger, you certainly don't think of Keith Richards. Brian Jones is the perfect British rock star. He's the first English rock star with perhaps the best look there's ever been of any British rock star. He was the one who was introducing them to these Moroccan sounds, to world music, he was the one who was the friend of John Lennon, the friend of Jimi Hendrix. Although there were five individuals you sort of knew that he was the governor. He was a major player in the 1960's in charting new regions which had been thought otherwise impossible for young white men to even think about. Musically, fashion wise, attitude wise. He was a trailblazer. Hedonism, excess, he embodied all of those in his 27 years. - Brian's peripatetic wanderings around London, a hunted man, obviously called for a sense of relocation and his advisors came up with Cotchford Farm down in East Sussex in the little village of Hartfield. So he found a great sense of peace and identity at Cotchford Farm. With the village of Hartfield and the locals here adopted him. They're very protective and so for the short while that he was here during 68 and into 69 he found a sense of community which didn't exist in London. - Brian has found his dream home, previously owned by AA Milne, the author of Winnie the Pooh, and it has a swimming pool which is ideal for him. He kind of seems to be largely, as far as I know, off drugs at that point although he's drinking a lot. - He was indulged in by the doctors who went on prescribing right till when he died. When people say oh, he wasn't taking drugs anymore. He wasn't smoking hash and taking cocaine or taking anything else of that type but he was taking a whole bunch of dreadful type of things. And he was drinking heavily! That's why his health so badly declined in the following year. Brian was very much a broken man and was never functioning at the same level of genius that he had before because he was relying on these prescription pills. The doctors overprescribed constantly which is why little by little this problem developed in the group, I think, where because everybody was preoccupied with their own thing but Brian was the absent one. As time went by, he came to, he knew I was seeing a lot of Mick and Keith and he would ask me, what are the Stones doing? He would use these words, what are the Stones doing, what are they up to and so forth as if he wasn't part of it anymore. - Well Brian by the time rock n' roll had become marginalized as far as the group was concerned simply because they couldn't rely on him, they wouldn't know whether he was gonna turn up to the recording sessions or turn up too late or turn up in a condition in which he couldn't contribute. - Cotchford Farm needed some renovations and from all available reports of the builders they were on a jolly as we say over here and they weren't gonna get much done. This existed for a period of time before even Brian decided that enough was enough. The building work was shoddy and they were generally taking over, in particular the main builder Frank Thorogood even moved into the property. - Frank Thorogood was brought into the movie by Tom Keylock so the pair of 'em were in cohorts at some level or another. - Tom Keylock was a minder. He was one of those people that occupy positions, roadie, chauffer, tour manager, stroke minder. - Tom Keylock was much older than the Rolling Stones. He had connections with all tiers of officialdom police and also the underworld as well. So he was a shady character, world wise. - Frank and Tom Keylock were really living the life in Brian's house. - Brian was not around. He was always in the country and he wasn't going to, I think a lot of times he just didn't go even to the recording sessions and so on. - Yeah, I saw Brian in the studio, he's sitting in the corner. - He had no discipline whatsoever. And I think that was his undoing because they thought if we can't rely on him we'll get on without him. And that's what eventually happened. - He was a difficult guy to love, Brian. I can imagine Brian really getting up in Mick and Keith's nose in the end because of his demands and his moaning and dissatisfaction with his lot. - But the idea that Brian was pushed out I think is ridiculous. Brian created a situation where they had to push him out otherwise he could've brought the band down. He was talking about leaving anyway so I wasn't surprised. I didn't really feel particularly bad about it because he was potentially brilliant and a very, very intelligent person but he just seemed to be set on destroying himself. ♪ Well I'm looking out the window ♪ - Cheltenham, people sort of said at the time or people have said since that it was a sort of stayed place but it never was. There was plenty to do and there was the typical rock scene that there'd been with the Teddy Boys and rock n' roll and the sort of coffee shop era. There were plenty of coffee shops and little cafes and plenty going on. ♪ Did you ever have the feeling baby ♪ - Brian came from a very well to do middle class family and he proved to be something of a character. - I think the significant clue to Brian is in his early childhood which is when he's four and his two year old sister dies. His parents soon have another daughter but the mother who'd been heartbroken at the loss of the first child transfers all her love and affection onto this new daughter, withdrawing it, it seems, from Brian. And Brian at that point starts to develop asthma. - Also, he told me things about his sister Pamela who had died and when he was a naughty boy, as it were, his father or mother would threaten him with the same result. - He wasn't interested in going to college although he went to a very good college called Dean Close in Cheltenham. - He could've gone to university, he was very bright, Brian. Had a very high Mensa intelligence rating but he also had the emotional rating of a child. And that was his problem. - His parents wanted him to be a classical musician so when he discovers jazz at the age of 14, starts playing saxophone. - Cannonball Adderley was Brian's real favorite. Which became an absolute religion with him. He played the piano quite nicely, he'd had quite legitimate lessons from a very good teacher but all the time his fanaticism for jazz music was coming to the fore it was a great disappointment to us and source of considerable anxiety when he became so wrapped up in his love of jazz music that in spite of everything we could do or say he went off and did it. - I used to learn piano and clarinet. I used to play clarinet. Thank you. And I lost interest in the clarinet because I became very involved in musical studies and I lost a lot of interest because I think I was getting in a rut, I was getting too involved. - His parents threw him out one Christmas time and a little before Christmas Left a suitcase on the doorstep. That was the first thing he told me about his parents. He wasn't interested in settling down to do any work. He didn't mind working, he got some jobs. He had a job which I mentioned earlier in Gloucestershire and he had no parents to help him. He didn't want to settle down. He just wanted to party, party, party and make love to as many girls as he possibly could. He was a naughty boy, he really was. When he told me about Valerie he also told me about an earlier one. At the time he was going out with Pat and she was pregnant. - By the time Brian was 19 he had three illegitimate children. How do you cope with that? His reputation wasn't very good. I was surprised by it because I'd never been friends with somebody who suddenly was persona non grata. Being beaten up by an umbrella in the street and such a thing. - We were both interested in jazz and blues but blues came on much stronger after that. To start with it was jazz. He was getting into the blues because he heard the old stuff like Lead Belly and I had a record with Elmore James on it which is something that really grabbed him the first time he heard it. - And I started to play the guitar and it gave me a new feel musically and I became interested in jazz and rhythm and blues eventually. Elmore Jones. - Gradually worked around to playing with the Rolling Stones, shut up. - One of the people we used to go and see in the early days was Alexis Korner. He was often called the father of rhythm and blues in England at that time. After the performance in Cheltenham, Brian came up to me together with a friend of his. I gave him my address and phone number and everything and he used to appear and sleep on our floor and come around the odd clubs if I was playing anywhere. - He was really in the forefront of British blues and he also played with a guy called Cyril Davies who had Cyril Davies All-Stars and these were real pioneers of British blues and it was when Alexis Korner starts a club in Ealing in West London in April 1962. - Brian sat in, he played with Alexis at the Ealing Club on several occasions. - He's billed himself as Elmo Lewis who has learned to play slide guitar. He's found a piece of metal that he can put on his finger and he can therefore emulate the sounds of Elmore James and others. - Alexis talked to Brian and right from the beginning he thought he was a very accomplished guitarist. He was very influential on Brian because he became a father figure, I thought, and he started to make real plans then for going to London. Well from my point of view the group started with Brian, really in that he was the first one I met. - There would not have been a Rolling Stones without Brian Jones. Brian Jones was the man who caused the band to come into effect. He was the one who placed an advert in Jazz News looking for other members who were interested in a blues band. The first person I think to respond to it was Ian Stewart, the keyboard player, who was particularly close friend of mine. - Mick, Keith and myself went down to the Ealing Club and I think it may be the second or third week we went there we saw Brian Jones play on stage with Paul Jones, I think it was. I think he played either with Paul Jones or Long John Bal-dree or both and we were just knocked out with his playing. The thing with Brian is he played amazing slide guitar and we heard people like Elmore James on record and here was a guy actually doing it for real, for live, in Ealing which was amazing and so we went and talked to him and Brian invited Mick to go and sing with his band at which point he asked me if I could play bass which I'd never done. That was it really, the Rolling Stones were born. People always seem to ask about Edith Grove, which was absolutely where Mick, Keith and Brian lived and I remember going there and going oh my God, do people really live like this. - Oh my God, what a place that was. That was a hellhole on Earth. - Before hippie squats it was a hippie squat. - I think squat is too good a word. - It was summer of 1962, I guess, and we were having a good time. We'd go there every week, rehearse, have a lot of laughs. One thing which I think people don't know so much about Brian, he actually had a brilliant sense of humor. I don't know, he used to pull the most ridiculous, gruesome faces. At that point we had become the Rolling Stones. At that point all the gigs were coming through Brian really. Our very first gig was the Marquee club which was pretty terrifying because at that point it was like one of the most prestigious clubs in London. - I'd been to a gig at the Flamingo and there were about, probably more people on the stage than there were in the audience. - He was a rat bastard 'cause he knew I had money from the Army and he used to make me go to the nearest wimpy bar and he'd say to me, you stay here, you can't come in with us. Give us some money so we can have the food but you stay out here in this really unbelievably cold winter 'cause he had a cold streak and Brian desperately wanted a new guitar. We went around the guitar shops and eventually I bought him a Harmony Stratocaster. - I think there was always a bone of contention between Brian and Mick and Keith as to who's band it was, who was the leader, because Brian because of starting his other band sort of thought well, it was his band, whereas really what it was a kind of amalgam of Brian Jones, Brian's band and with Mick, Keith and myself from what we had called Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys. I, after a while of doing this, decided that I didn't want to play bass anymore, I wanted to play guitar and so I left. - Brian is kind of running the gig initially and the management team who came to see them play in Richmond and signed them up is this young hustler called Andrew Loog Oldham and Eric Easton who was much more a traditional English showbiz kind of guy. - He was working with the Beatles on their publicity and he was looking for something more of his own, something he could move on from just being a publicist. - I think the reason Andrew didn't want him in the band was because he didn't feel that his look was quite right to the image. - He initially saw that the route for the Stones to take was a similar kind of route the Beatles took where Brian had Epstein knocked off the rough edges and promoted them as a more acceptable, good, clean living lads and all around entertainers and Andrew started in that direction with them. They had suits that he bought for them which they swiftly lost or mislaid, didn't wear 'em. - And I realized, 'cause I didn't realize when I first met them that it was Brian's group and everything revolved around him. He was a top class musician, Brian, really a great player. The whole group was good but you just knew that he was the leader somehow or another. He even got paid more money than anybody else, unbeknownst to the other Stones and I remember when they found out they weren't pleased. - During the tour in 1963, the end of 1963 when they're supporting the Everly Brothers, it emerges during that time that he's getting this additional five pounds a week to everyone else and Keith Richards later said when we found that out, that was the beginning of the end for Brian. - I think it would've been Mick rang me and said that they were doing some recordings and could I go along and do a number with them and then Andrew obviously was there and in fact Phil Spector was also in the studio at the same time 'cause Andrew was a great fan of Phil Spector's. On that record that I did with them you can hear the influence, that big sort of wall of sound. - I thought he was really important in the studio. He wasn't a producer in the technical sense, I don't believe but he was a producer in an emotional sense. - We used to laugh and talk about can you imagine Mick doing this when he's 40. It was unheard of and we used to talk about what are we gonna do when all this was over 'cause we were all convinced this was gonna last one or two years and we'd have to get a proper job. We just had no idea it was gonna last or had no idea it was gonna rock the world like it did. - I didn't really see too much of Brian until myself and the Pretty Things which by then we were doing pretty well. We got a house in Belgravia which is a very posh part of London which we were renting and the guy who had the flat downstairs was letting Brian who wasn't very fond of paying rent, he was staying in the basement so then we basically saw a lot more of one another again. - We were both gigging so we got home about an hour before and we're all getting stoned and that happened to be the day that Five by Five EP came out so we put it on, we're listening to it, completely stoned, having a laugh like you do and Brian came in and he saw us sitting around the record player and laughing with this record on. So he came rushing back with a ukulele and smashed it over Viv's head, good friends. So Viv is sitting there wearing this ukulele like, I wasn't wearing this before. And Brian was convinced we were taking the piss out of the record and when went away a week later he got all our singles and he melted them with a lighter and stuck them on the wall of the bathroom and wrote in shaving foam, you fucking cunts, you fucking wankers because he really thought, and we hadn't, we were really enjoying the record. That's paranoia for you. - Brian was maybe less of a happy character than when I used to know him, I must say, even though the Stones were by that time very, very successful. - No one in the British public really knows about the tensions that have begun to appear with in this band but Brian is seen as the personification of the Rolling Stones. - I think the most important thing to us is when we go on stage is that we succeed in communicating to an audience and the only way we can do this is to produce an exciting atmosphere therefore if the kids scream we love it, we react to their reaction. - Bill was the only one who was coming to the house and stayed. Very often, you know, sleep there and I knew that Bill was really, he really liked Brian. But the others I knew, I knew I could feel that there was a sort of bad feeling about him. But Brian was really a nice boy. He was crying almost every night. He was telling me about the film he wanted to do with me and he was telling me how vulgar were the songs of Keith and Mick. Oh yeah, he was really pissed off with them already because he thought that it was not the music that he really loved and that the old group was his group and suddenly he was feeling that the group was escaping from him. - He still felt he was leader of the group for the couple years after it started and he used to be a bit bitter under the surface that Mick was the leader of the group, not him, and the fact that they were recording all Mick and Keith's songs. Brian was incapable of writing music and so I'm not really sure what else he wanted them to do. - Keith and Mick realized it early on and Andrew realized early on that the money was to be made both working and composing and doing your own songs. A matter of necessity would change the direction of the band. - No, we're sort of developing in lots of different directions musically, I think. - Brian's big complaint to me was he got a bigger mailbag as Mick and he wanted to sing a song and I said fuck off, Mick's sing a song, you can't, he probably could sing. I said why are you rocking the boat? Get on with it. He said, "Yeah but you know, "I got as many a fans as Mick." So that was his big beef. - By the time of the third American tour Brian is starting to get into what we see as his demise. He's very into uppers, he's also drinking a lot, Brian also drank a lot and later you would see this puffiness on his face. - Satisfaction changed everything not only in terms of the commercial success of the band, the broadness of the audience, the success in America, all of those things but it also changed the dynamic of the band because Mick and Keith were suddenly established as the songwriters. Suddenly the band was going to be doing their original material and that changed the dynamic of the band. - Once that was established, the focus or the tension in the band changed to the lead singer and the lead guitarist who were writing the songs. Brian got sidelined and Brian couldn't take that kind of thing. It was a massive blow to his self esteem. - That's why he started to drink more, take more pills every day and there was always nice people to bring huge quantities of pills for Brian. - He was unequipped for fame, he was fragile and he was quite comfortable while he was emulating the inspiration or aspects of these heroes like Muddy Waters or Bo Diddley or whoever. He was comfortable in his own world. Soon as they try to move him out of that and get him to write his own songs he was uncomfortable. - Pop songwriting was not something that he could easily knock off and Brian was extremely instrumental, fundamentally instrumental in making every one of those hit songs immortal by his contributions. - Yes, I think he was highly thought of. He was clearly extremely adept as a musician. He was able to play almost any instrument. - Things like Under My Thumb where he played marimba and then he played sitar of course on Paint It Black. He could pick up an instrument whether it be an oboe or Mellotron and he could change the aspect of the song so that it became a hit. He made hit records. - Acid is an extraordinary tool to explore magical dimensions that exist within oneself. When Brian felt comfortable and saw the wealth and the benefit of these things, being ultrasensitive as an individual, he would easily fall prey to undue fears. - Brian was definitely the most experimental in terms of drug use at that point in time. He was a tortured soul. He was out of balance. He had psychological issues. Looking back, I think probably he was an undiagnosed bipolar, unmedicated bipolar. We were all too young and too inexperienced to know how to deal with that. I mean, yes, he was a cracked person, - Anita was an extraordinary personality, was so vibrant and so intelligent and so inspiring and so avant guard in her sexuality and everything else that obviously Brian would be hopelessly in love with her and remain hopelessly in love with her despite all the other girls. - She scared me a bit, I found her scary. I think she was very intelligent but she got into some weird areas. - When she came and joined Brian at a break in the tour in Miami they certainly did a lot of acid over a couple days that she stayed and I think everybody knew that. I don't recall anybody else doing acid at that particular moment in time. - Keith Richards was with this girl called Linda Keith who left him and he was very cut up about it so he took refuge with Brian and Anita. - Kind of reignited Brian and Keith, the friendship that they had when the lived together in Fuller but there's a lot of drugs going on. - They always blame Anita for everything that happened but it's totally unfair because Brian was not by any stretch of the imagination a faithful guy. - Brian was a very touching character. You could not help being intrigued by him. There was something very vulnerable about him, very sensitive, he had an incredible insight into people an almost devilish insight. Now that was the mean side of him that if he saw through people and then used what he felt was their weakness somehow to torture them. - He invited me around to his apartment with his girlfriend, we had dinner together and I sold him a German uniform he bought from me 'cause I was so military at the time as well. - And he had this need to challenge people, challenge the public by showing up in a Nazi uniform which you could do that maybe in London but in Munich it was not funny. - Towards the end of that summer, Brian and Anita go to Morocco where Brian and Anita have a huge row and Brian tries to punch her, maybe does punch her but certainly punches the wall and breaks his hand. - He did break his wrist one time in Africa and from then on he just didn't wanna play guitar. He played soprano sax on a Beatles B-side. - One day on the set, Anita came to see me. Brian had left and she said Brian is asking whether he could do the music for the movie. I was speechless. You don't turn down the offer of a Stone to do your music in 1967. Allen Klein just had taken over the management of the Stones and Brian said you got to come with me to see him and he was as scared of him, I think, as I was and convince him that he let me do this. And a couple of months later during which time he was supposed to compose the music he was in very bad shape. He was not always in the state that he could work or focus or concentrate or even show up before one at night or so. He asked for a lot of musicians, a wonderful pianist, Nicky Hopkins, to come in. Keith Richards fortunately showed up who saved the recording session. - Jimmy Page plays on that for example and the soundtrack never came out as an LP but it's sensational, in fact. - I was in the recording studio when it became vividly clear that the band were going in a direction without Andrew. They were recording Satanic, the tension was really increasingly unpleasant, particularly Mick and Keith were coming to the sessions later and later. - In 67 when I stayed with him we started working on stuff together which was very avant guard because he was always ahead of the curve and he wanted to do some proto rap things with my using words that I was coming up with and saying oh can we use this but not on a separate project, on a Rolling Stones project, so he was convinced that this would somehow fit. - Sergeant Norman Pilcher was an opportunist career cop based in the London drug squadron in the 1960's. He made a name for himself during the decade for busting high profile pop stars. - Sergeant Pilcher was known as the groupie cop. He busted John Lennon and Yoko Ono, George Harrison and it's always very dubious. - Pilcher's first strike on the music industry occurred in 1966 where he went for Donovan. This dovetailed with the News of the World article Pop Stars and Drugs, so it was obvious from that point that the press were working hand in hand with the police. Brian Jones, he had the misfortune to meet two reporters undercover from News of the World and who managed to talk him into revealing all sorts of detail about his drug use. When Brian would continually reference his leader of the Rolling Stones status they scurried back to their offices to say we've got Mick Jagger talking about drug use. This in turn went into the second feature of Pop Stars and Drugs saying that Mick Jagger had been in a club in London talking about his drug use. When this was disseminated at the Rolling Stones organization Mick Jagger who was in Italy at the time slapped liable suit on the News of the World. So the News of the World were in a quandary and the only way they could embarrass the liable suit was to find Mick Jagger in possession of drugs. Now, within the next few days a furious amount of activity went on to penetrate the Rolling Stones organization, penetrate Mick and Keith's movements and as luck would have it for them that a party was being held at Redlands in Sussex which was gonna be attended by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. - The Redlands bust, which is February 67, Brian isn't there. In fact, he's not there because he's been working on the soundtrack of A Degree of Murder and he and Anita are supposed to go down there. - The party took place and the News of the World tipped off the local police who mounted a raid on the property. They found a few roaches, they found in a coat of Mick Jagger's four amphetamine pills which would have been legally acquired in Italy. More damning for one of their party, Robert Fraser they found 20 plus heroin tablets in his jacket pocket. But as far as News of the World was concerned it meant they'd embarrassed the liable suit. - They decide to go to Morocco and then they drive down to through France and on the first day Brian is sitting in the back of the car just rolling immense joints and eventually he basically collapses, he kind of has an asthmatic attack and they leave him in hospital and they continue on their way. He's gonna join them when he gets out of hospital. - Anita didn't callously abandon Brian for Keith. This affair started but she was torn between two lovers and she wrote, what people don't know is that she wrote every day to Brian and Brian every day to her. Indeed, Brian made me read Anita's letters. In this case he pushed the wrong buttons and got the wrong effects and he could've, when he got more physical with her to put it mildly there was a problem, what would they do and they decided that to avoid a worse problem the best thing to do was to leave. - They split to Tangiers and they leave Brian with the bill. There was kind of a lot of nastiness towards Brian. - The problem is that Brian felt abandoned and being paranoid he felt, oh, they've left me behind sort of thing. He was devastated by being left behind but after the fact he told me that he was himself to blame. - During the sessions when we recorded in London everything was more or less fine with Anita and Brian even though she was very upset that he didn't make more of this opportunity and the fact that Keith stepped in to help out and to get the thing done should've been a hint but I was unaware of it. Two months later the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Anita showed up with Brian, of course, and we were on the red carpet and all that and it was a great event but Keith was there as well. - Brian was determined to get Anita back. These arrangements were made and much to Brian's relief I went with him to Cannes with the intention of seeing whether we could engineer a reconciliation between Brian and Anita. It was a very joyous night and it was full of affection and good times but it became very clear to all of us that she would not go back to Brian. I told Brian, look, the best thing to do is let's fly in Suki. I thought she'd be a good substitute and indeed she was for a while a very good substitute and she took it but she wasn't Anita. She had the looks but she didn't have the character, she didn't have this amazing Anita vibe. What I firmly believe was the turning point in Brian's life was when he lost the only girl he ever really loved. I think this was a very severe blow to him. He changed suddenly and alarmingly from a bright, enthusiastic young man to a quiet and morose and inward-looking young man. - Very interestingly on the day Mick and Keith were formally charged with possession of drugs following the Redlands raid, Pilcher's squad mounted a raid on Brian's flat in South Kensington on Courtfield Road where Brian was present. - We arrived fairly late in the evening and went to bed at Courtfield Road and in the morning the phone was ringing off the hook and they were all calling us because everybody seems to have been tipped off that we would be busted. And they all said, have you been busted and we said what are you talking about? We talked to Robert Fraser who said let me send Mohammad, my servant, to clean up Courtfield Road. And there was likelihood that drugs were secluded somewhere and with a team of Pilcher's squad raiding the place they would probably find drugs but also which has later come to light it probably didn't matter 'cause Pilcher's squad would probably bring their own just in case. - When I went to the door to open the door for whom I took to be Mohammad there was this rush of people that again, I took to be reporters. I tried to close the door but they were faster than I was and they knocked me backwards and then they rushed forward and steadied me before I hit the wall and said, "So sorry, sir, but here we have a warrant "to search these premises for drugs." - The raid took place under the glare of the press corps who were camped out outside the flat. - They marched straight over to where Brian had his bed on the floor, they flipped his mattress and very conveniently a kind of cheap-o leather wallet came out and this cop with a big smile on his face looked at it and it was full of this grass. Then they found this empty vial and this cop said to us, "Ooh, I would like to know what's been in there." And we said, "What?" I remember Brian, it was like this stupid act, what! And he looked and he said, "Cocaine." And we went, "Oh no!" You know, like this, and he went yeah, but you know, what could be, I'm not gonna charge you for that, am I, he said, what could be in there? One thousandth, those are the exact words, I'll never forget them, one thousandth of a grain? We were taken down to Chelsea police station and it was a media frenzy. There were hundreds of reporters and suddenly someone from the office came and posted bail for both of us and so we were told that we were free to go until the next day when we had to go to court but meanwhile Brian was caving in slowly because his defense said you better not see any of the other Rolling Stones, don't hang out with Stash too much. You gotta stay away because if they bust you again together it could make your case worse so Brian got a bit isolated and then I was absolutely astounded and both Brian and I looked at each other in horror because that's when we heard the police lie and call us naive if you will but we never expected Scotland Yard, we thought we can lie but they're not allowed to lie. But they did because their account of the bust and what we said and so on was so completely wrong and inaccurate that we were absolutely horrified and so again we were remanded to be tried by jury later on and during that time after our second court appearance that's when Brian started to fall apart. Brian was somebody that everybody looked up to. When he was on top of his game nobody could beat him and certainly nobody disrespected him in those days. Everybody deferred to him, in the studio and everything. His word was king. He only lost that edge when after we were busted and he was unfortunately introduced to Mandrax and he took like a doctor order to these prescription pills and started to overindulge in them and then he became absolutely useless. - Brian again being of a rather weak nature would succumb to almost any temptation. He could resist anything but temptation. - I remember seeing him at Olympic being propped up in the booth and basically given the instrument and he did play and he managed to play but he was almost falling over. So yes, it was very difficult and it was tragic. - Earlier Jones admitted that he'd allowed his flat in Courtfield Road in West Kensington to be used for drug taking. The prosecution said a total of 35 and a quarter grains of cannabis, that's enough to make about seven to 10 cigarettes were found in his flat. Jones is said to have told police, "Yes, it is hash. "I do smoke it, but not cocaine, man. "That's not my scene." - None of us spoke like that. They just made it up to make it sound plausible. So the whole thing was completely trumped up. - Jones in evidence said he had taken drugs in the past to a slight extent but he'd now decided to have absolutely nothing to do with them. He was never really dependent on them but was only an occasional smoker. - He didn't listen to me, sadly. I went to the gallery, he did the stupidest move of his life which would prove fatal to him. He pled guilty. - When sentence was passed, Jones winced and a number of teenage girls in the public gallery stood up and burst into tears. Passing sentence, Mr. Reginald Seton, the chairman, told Jones you occupy a position by which you have a large following of youth and therefore it behooves you to set an example. - So I think it's likely that given the evidence was conclusive on Brian that he had no other option than to declare himself guilty. - He totally let down the side and it was a huge tactical miss, a heartbreaking, huge tactical mistake. And a tragic mistake because he was sentenced to jail time and there was this manifestation and yes, he did spend the night, then they released, had this nervous breakdown almost and so on and so forth but it escalated where in October of 67 he had about a year and a half to live, not quite two years. - His drug taking was obvious. He was a victim and easy prey for the police and the establishment so they were picking on him. Mick and Keith were much stronger, they were resilient, they were able to cope with it much better. They were able to even exploit it in a positive way if that's possible but Brian was just going downhill. - It was a plot to get rid of the Rolling Stones once and for all and Brian was seen as the anchor or the person who was the best musician and so on and decapitating the Rolling Stones, you already had Mick and Keith, those guys were going to jail. If you jailed Brian that was the end of the band and it was finished, there would be no Rolling Stones anymore and this terrible influence that the Rolling Stones would have on the youth was this menace, was being averted by this fucking bowler-hatted establishment. - It's interesting because where Mick and Keith in the Redlands raid were under advice to swear not guilty of the charges, Brian was advised to plead guilty. The circumstances of the Redlands raid were the evidence was flimsy. Brian's was perhaps more damning. - Brian just wasn't equipped to cope with that and there was nobody to help. We didn't know how to support him and he was a manipulative person and he was a person who would push you to the very limits. - When I seen Brian just a few months earlier, in January he came in the studio when I was working as a tape op for All Along the Watchtower, Jimi Hendrix, and he came down hanging out with his girlfriend. And he seemed really sharp and on the case and he didn't look overweight or anything, he looked pretty healthy and then to see him three or four months later where he'd kind of put on a lot of weight, he was very puffy, that thing you get when you drink a lot or you're taking drink and pills. It was something had been going on. He wasn't like unconscious, people have said so many things about this guy. He could still function but he obviously wasn't well. No one really bothered to talk to him, he was put in a booth. He's in the same room as everyone but they had screens all around him because he mainly was playing acoustic. He got treated pretty bad by that point but I think one of the highlights or the magic that you were talking about earlier was the No Expectations and the solo that Brian played on that. If you think of the kind of state he was in in a way or perhaps they're not getting as much from him as other members of the band, let's put it that way, I disagree when people have said that his mic wasn't even plugged in, that's just another kind of let's get at Brian. If it was good it would've been used. If it wasn't it could be replaced, we had eight tracks. But that night when he played the solo on that it was just stunning. - We could call it persecution if you like, we could call it some personal misconduct and the consequences thereof. However you approach it and however it's acceptable to other people. - After that bust at Courtfield Road he was on the run. He was paranoid, he couldn't feel safe anywhere. He'd moved within Chelsea and yet then a second raid occurred. To me, this is far more obvious that the drugs were planted because the marijuana that was found was secreted in a ball of wool and what Brian Jones would be doing with a ball of wool, certainly not knitting. - Thankfully for him he met a fairly receptive magistrate and offered him a lifeline but this lifeline was also dependent on heavy psychological reports and if one actually sees them you could see the state of Jones' shattered vizard at this point, he was absolutely broken. - Brian Jones had various trips out to Morocco. He was enchanted with the sights and the sounds and the aromas and when he first heard these Pan Pipe players of Joujouka from the tribes of the inter-lands of Morocco introduced to him by the artist, the left field artist Brion Gysin, and to him it validated a lot of the sounds that were in his head and he became enchanted with them. - A significant point about this is that Brian was like the first person really as a British popular music to examine world music. - I think he was relieved to have left the Stones. He was very determined to, I think they call it, turn over the page, yes, he was. Which is one of the reasons he bought the house, I think, in the country, to be away from the nightlife and everything rock n' roll. I think it's rock n' roll, it wasn't the blues, it's the rock n' roll life. - He got over that and was really planning ahead. He was wanting to form a new band and he was very excited because of all the musicians that he'd heard in Morocco and it was what we now would call world music. Brian actually asked me if I would sing with them. - I think he was happy there. Sometimes he was lonely but it was his decision to live in the country and be alone. He had many friends, people that would come and see him but very often the wrong people in my book. - When Brian left the Stones his finances were reevaluated and even though he was in for a large payment and a large retainer there was no real ready cash. He didn't write songs, he was not going to tour so he was only getting mechanical royalties which, this was in 1969, so if we think of the rest of the Rolling Stones who were fairly broke at that point and soon would have to go into exile, Brian's finances were going to be even more challenged. So it really all came to a head. - The night of Brian's death I was in the studio with the Rolling Stones round the corner here at Olympic and around about 12 o'clock, might've been a bit later, Tom Keylock came into the Olympic Studios and gathered Mick and a couple of the other Stones around and outside the control room where I was sitting with Marianne, finally Marianne went out, was called out there and went into a huddle and I think Tom put his arm around her and she came back in, she was in tears and she told me that Brian had drowned in his swimming pool that night and they thought that he got into difficulties because of his asthma. - July 3rd, 1969, I was in the Stones office, the news had come through of Brian's death. Everybody was genuinely shocked and upset from the musicians to all the people, of course. - And I only knew that he died because the police called me the following morning because they'd gone through his phone and I was the last person he called, so they said. - The response to Brian's death was it was an accident waiting to happen. - We were stunned when he died and stunned that he was drowned because he was a strong swimmer. - The combination of prescription pills, downers and the like and alcohol damaged his liver and his heart and it was very depressing, all that. - I was disappointed that the verdict was what it was and basically gave the newspapers the ability to say it was drugs and alcohol but the only drugs he had that I could see were prescription drugs. - And the amount of alcohol in his body was minor. In my day when I was 27, 28, I'd have to drink a hell of a lot to do anything as stupid as be unconscious in a swimming pool. So none of it added up. - I thought it was all a bit odd and I questioned Mick a little bit about it and I said, well what happens now, what are you gonna do. And he said, "It goes on, it goes on." I said, "What goes on?" He said, "Everything." And everything did go on. Of course they got Mick Taylor involved and did the Hyde Park concert. - Peace, peace, he is not dead, he does not sleep, he has awakened from the dreams of life. When Mick read that appalling Shelley poem, it was stamped on some dead butterflies and that was supposedly that. Invulnerable nothings. We decay like corpses. - I was extremely upset when Brian died and the streets of Cheltenham were absolutely packed. And I mean packed. - We weren't welcome at the funeral because they didn't want that kind of press attention, especially since it was strongly suspected when Brian died, we all thought that it was an OD of some sort. - I just felt very sorry, very sad for him. Of course, it wasn't until years later that people started making conspiracy theories about his death. - Can't dismiss what the coroner actually came up with that night. Although again, we have to also remember that Frank Thorogood, the main builder, the character who was in the pool with Brian was actually taken away that night, he was actually arrested. I could look at it in one sense and say hay, the builders are sacked, he's dead a few hours later which could easily lead you to believe that there was some revenge. - And he rang me the evening sadly that he died and he seemed to me absolutely fine but we'd been several times before, I can't remember, the boys remember more than I do, and they were explicitly told do not touch. And I think it was an inhaler but I could be wrong, his medicine, it was called his medicine. It was always by the side of the pool in case and I was asked if there had been a party going on. As far as I know there was no party going on. Yes, there were people in the background and people at the house, throughout the house but it wasn't a party, I would've heard. - But I think that there was definitely partying happening and definitely cars leaving and the builders getting out of there but it would've been an impromptu party at Brian's expense rather than a Brian Jones party that he had held himself. I suspect it would be another example of those guys exploiting him. - I found out later snippets from various people. The builder who was involved in this, Frank Thorogood, who was in the pool with Brian at some stage. - He's had a lot of building work done but it's not been that very satisfactory. He fires the builders. The builders hang around, however. And there's a party that night. - The Nicholas Fitzgerald book was dismissed by everybody at the time but I think that probably got right. I think what Nicholas did, he turned up to go and see Brian, one of those guys that Brian had befriended again probably thought he was a good friend of Brian's but probably wouldn't have lasted very long. Turn up with the maid, went, came down the lane to see Brian, saw through the trees that there was all this activity going on in the pool, not liking it, someone pops up, almost certainly Tom Keylock, and threatens him. People claim they saw a lot of horseplay going on in the swimming pool 'cause of course the official cause of death is death by drowning. - Brian was provoking him in some way with a little bit of banter if you wanna call it that and the banter got a bit nasty and there was a bit of horseplay in the pool. And Thorogood left him in a state either after a ducking or a push or whatever and walked away and left him not really knowing or caring what condition he was in. - Brian died during some kind of party in an accident that went wrong, I would say that's pretty much kind of what happened but if there were other witnesses to his death I think one of them would've come forward by now. - The relationship with the builder was a horrible, awful relationship. It was a sick relationship, that's quite clear. And the builder was sick fucker and Brian was a sick fucker but I don't think that guy murdered him. I think the guy might've contributed to his death, certainly, they might've been fooling around but I don't think that he murdered Brian. - This nasty incident led to Brian not being murdered but being, the technicality is manslaughter. - The first officer on the scene was a young PC Albert Evans and he spoke to about 20 people in the garden. He put it all in his notebook, they all near enough said the same thing. There had been a fight between Frank Thorogood and Brian Jones that led to the death of Brian Jones. When Bob Marshall, the CID officer who led the investigation turned up about four hours later. The first person he spoke to was Albert Evans and he led him away from Cotchford Farm, walked him out the lane and he said what have you heard, what do you think? And young PC Evans said everyone's saying the same thing, there's been a fight between Frank Thorogood and Brian Jones which has led to the death of Brian Jones. At that point, Marshall put his arm around PC Evans, said that'll be the last we hear of that and led him back to the house. And from that point onwards the real police investigation into the death of Brian Jones ended and what they found as a result of that was a constructed story. We know from the two drug squad officers who arrived at the scene at Cotchford Farm about one o'clock in the morning that Frank Thorogood wasn't at Cotchford Farm at that point, he'd been taken down to the hospital and he'd been taken down to the hospital because of treatment that was required to his hand. I can only assume from what scene has been described at Cotchford Farm that Frank would've injured his hand in that fight with Brian. - The builders had been fired that same day and they were very upset with Brian, they believed that they had money owed to them. - Anna Wohlin was probably the youngest person there in the garden on the night of Brian Jones' death. She was undoubtedly, she says it herself, she was high, she'd been taking drugs and she freaked out when Brian Jones died. She was still like that days later and she was angry about it as well. She was confused, she was starting to speak out about it. Everybody who turned up at Cotchford Farm would hear Anna saying he didn't die through drink and drugs. It was a fight that had led to the death so the decision was taken to remove Anna from Cotchford Farm and bring her up to London to stay with Bill Wyman and his girlfriend Astrid. Up here in London, Anna carried on talking about the truth, she kept on saying that Brian Jones had died in a fight and people needed to know this and she arranged through a friend to speak to the Times newspaper and to tell them the truth and at that point she was sharing all of this with Astrid and within hours she'd been put in a car and she'd been driven across London to Allen Klein's house. She had to stay in the UK because of the inquest that took place four days after Brian's death but she was driven from the inquest by Rolling Stones management, taken to Heathrow, thrown on a plane and told never to come back. - When we found Anna she said one of the reasons she did not come forward was that she was scared of Tom and that she had been warned after the inquest. - I would've been much more frightened to have been threatened by Tom Keylock than by Allen Klein. Keylock was a funny guy. - Janet also was having an affair with Tom at the time and it seemed that the reason she was also frightened of talking about the whole thing and she almost got into hiding was because of Tom Keylock. Tom held the key to this thing and he openly said that he believed that his colleague at the time who is of course deceased when we were looking into this, Frank, had murdered Brian. - So Keylock, that worked for Keith, was down there at the farm, he had gotten down there and the various tidbits that I gleaned and learned over the next couple of days have always disturbed me since those days, one of which was that he was burning stuff there, so none of us could really understand what that was. What was he burning? What he was burning, because none of it ever showed up, was a lot of receipts that were to do, I think, with the building work. The building work that had been going on at the farm was very expensive and there was a whole bunch of people living on Brian's tab. - My conclusion in the end was that he was being royally exploited by Tom Keylock primarily who even in his death was exploiting him. He had taken his Rolls Royce, he had taken his clothes, he had taken his possessions, he somehow managed to inveigle a lot of money out of the Rolling Stones and again nobody quite knows why. - Tom Keylock was having an affair with this girl who announced that she was pregnant so Tom Keylock, instead of being, officially he was somewhere else but actually he was at Cotchford when this thing happened. When Brian died he called Frank, Frank Keylock, his brother, who was very high up in the CID and he got the whole thing supposedly on behalf of the Stones, they kind of manipulated this thing, that's where people get really confused but Keylock was acting on his own without any mandate from anybody else to cover his own ass about his own affair. - Frank Keylock probably would've helped his brother back in return but he wouldn't have been able to offer as much support, as much help, as the chief constable who'd supersede the police officers who were across the details of Brian's death within hours and they were endorsing the police activity on the ground that was covering up the death. I've heard that the fighting was going on in the gardens rather than in the pool itself earlier in the day and it's interesting, there's a trough in the garden and that trough contained water that would've been fresh water. It could easily have been the case that Brian had actually died outside of the swimming pool and that trough of fresh water played a part in it. - I ran a fan club for Brian Jones when I was a teenager, bit of a teenage obsession. I went to the house, went to Cotchford Farm, met the owner and I became friends with Mary Hallett who was Mrs. Hallett, who was Brian's maid and her husband Les Hallett. Then she passed away and I'd still go to the house from time to time and the last time I saw Les Hallett it was just hello, how are you and then as I was leaving the area, leaving the property of Cotchford and going down the drive he was running after my car saying they drowned him in the trough, they drowned him in the trough and I didn't know, what's a trough, right? So I guess it's a barrel of some sort but he said they drowned him the trough and they threw him in the pool. - That was the water that was inside his lungs, it wasn't chlorinated water, there were no chemicals inside the lungs. I've had the medical reports analyzed by senior pathologists and they have said that the stress on the tissues around the heart show that Brian Jones would've been aware he was being murdered. Apparently the body responded a certain way and they can tell it, those experts can tell through the tissue damage what level of stress the body was under. - You can look at a contract that's written about in many books where Brian was due to be paid a block of money, 100,000 pounds as a one off payment for his departure from the Rolling Stones that happened four weeks before he died. He was then due to get 20,000 pounds a year every year that the band stayed together. So you're talking about an awful lot of money. Now when you look at Brian Jones' will you can see that he died basically without much money at all so that money that Allen Klein was due to pay him, about 100,000 pounds one off, the 20,000 pounds a year didn't come. - Allen Klein, you can't involve Allen Klein in this, Allen Klein had much more important things to deal with with the Beatles and so on. - Allen Klein's making millions of dollars anyway, 100,000 pounds to Allen Klein is neither here nor there when you think that he's personally responsible for the revenue of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He was a heavy man, no question about that but he was a Jewish accountant. Jewish accountants count the money, they don't have people killed. The idea that Allen Klein had somebody killed, frankly, I think it's an insult to the man's memory. He was a tough son of a bitch but I don't think he was that hard. - He was always tardy in coughing up the money that was their own money because he was always playing around with it and it might've indirectly caused Brian his life, this thing that the money wasn't arriving, that conveniently it was delayed. - Allen Klein decided to send his own person down there and investigate look into Brian Jones' death. A report was put together, Sam Cutler, one of the Stones' tour managers said that a report was put together that went back to Maddox Street, the Rolling Stones' head office. - He was highly suspicious of the builder. - Months after Brian Jones' death the Stones flew to America on what became their most lucrative tour of all time at that point. If the Rolling Stones had had to stay in the UK because of the death into Brian Jones' police investigations, et cetera, it would've just been an investigation that would get bigger and bigger and bigger so Allen Klein had a real investment in making sure that tour went ahead as planned. And this was something right which makes me annoyed 'cause sometimes people say oh, Mick and Keith had something to do with it. - The band, that's ridiculous, Brian Jones was worth a lot more to people alive than dead. - After Brian's death, Joan Fitzsimmons was really, violently attacked. Her body was found effectively left for dead on the side of the beach, she was blinded, her skull was fractured and she had teeth missing. Shed been really badly beaten up and if you wind things back earlier on to that day Frank Thorogood had been at the family home, he'd been banging on the door, he'd been demanding to know where Joan was. He was saying she knows too much about the Rolling Stones, she knows too much about Brian's death and within hours Joan was attacked. We now know that Joan Fitzsimmons was definitely at Brian's house on the night he died. She drove his girlfriend or his ex-girlfriend Sue Potier away from the house about 30 minutes before Brian died and then days later Joan was in the pubs in and around Chichester saying it's not true what's in the papers about Brian Jones, the drink and drugs headlines, they're not true, he was attacked, there was fighting, he was attacked and he died. Frank Thorogood obviously got wind of that, he heard of that, brought himself back down to Sussex and within hours Joan was attacked and her body was found left for dead. There was a newspaper report locally down in Chichester that led to national newspapers reporting that said there was a woman in a coma in hospital in Southampton which is where she was taken to that they said, everyone said there were connections to Brian Jones' death. This woman in the coma was linked to the death. The police then shut that down and said there were no links at all but the police files that have now come out show that the police knew the attack on Brian Jones, the death of Brian Jones instantly led within days to the attack on Joan Fitzsimmons and that the same people, the same names were involved. If you look at the pictures of the before and after you could see the level of the violence that took place at Cotchford Farm that night, it was the same people involved. It was the same police force that then came in to look at it. They knew they had a dead man in the swimming pool. They knew they had a body left for dead on the side of the beach and they knew the same person was named time and time again by witnesses, yet they did nothing to try and bring that man to justice. They did everything to create headlines that said drink and drugs are bad. If you look back at the social and political times in 68, 69, to work out why did the police or why did the home office or why did the government want to spin the death of Brian Jones, you have to look at the growth of the counterculture, the growth of drugs for the first time as a social problem and you have to look at what the home office were advising the government, they were basically saying get rid of the pop stars and you get rid of the drug problem. If you then look at the busts that were carried out on Brian, on Mick in particular, on Brian especially, all of those drug busts, 90% of them involved the police actually trying to plant drugs inside the Stones properties. The politics at the time was to say we've got to destroy these bands, we've got to destroy this counterculture that's emerging and people like Brian Jones represented it more than anybody else. Again, if you go back to the Stones in 67, 68, 69, Mick and Keith were not quite as rebellious as Brian, they certainly weren't as connected to drink and drugs as Brian. They didn't look as counterculture as Brian. He was the one, he was the DNA of the band's rebellious nature and when he died he became a poster boy. The government could literally hold him up and say this is what happens to you kids if you take drugs and it was a total, total misuse of actually what had happened. The man had been killed but rather than get to the truth they would rather spin out a lie to suit their own political agenda about what was going wrong in their minds with society and the emerging counterculture at the time 'cause the truth is Brian Jones was killed. The truth is Brian Jones didn't die of drink and drugs. - They wanted to make an example of him, didn't they? They wanted to show the kids, oh, if you behave like this this is what's gonna happen. Look what happened to him, don't do drugs, don't enjoy yourself, keep your nose clean, go and work hard. - It piled up and all due to the fact that the establishment wanting to do away with the Rolling Stones. It's very, very tragic. That's how Brian Jones was killed, not by any conspiracy. - And this all came together and I said my God, he didn't just die, he was murdered and the Sussex police completely bungled, completely bungled the investigation. All they did was just put this in a nice little package, then they sealed it up and they put it in the ground because that's the message that they wanted to get across to people. They wanted to take down the Rolling Stones, they wanted to take down Brian Jones. Drink and drugs, died in his pool, nice, neat, that's it. - I think the police in 2010 just continued the cover up that was originally put in place in 1969. That investigation in 1969 could've easily resulted in the truth coming out, they had all the evidence. It was a very deliberate decision at a senior level to make sure that the truth didn't come out. There has never been a reason given for why it was a 75 year rule put onto the Brian Jones files but what is absolutely clear is that when you look at the Brian Jones police investigation that it was was a cover up and the you look at the Joan Fitzsimmons attack that happened two weeks later. If they didn't have that 75 year rule put on that file it would be very clear that there had been that double cover up. It's wrong that a man's death could be ignored and the truth be hidden so the establishment could play politics with drug culture on the back of that man's death, that's wrong. - Keith Richards once said about him that he was a hard man to like. I didn't find that. I actually found him very easy to like. I think he was a hard man to like if you had to live with him, if you had to work with him or if you had to be with him for long periods of time because he had very little in the way of moral sensibility, he was amoral and unreliable. - I find him a very nice, charming, charming guy and somewhat of an original in that band. - I just thought he was wonderful. Softly spoken and quite shy in a way. - He was a very friendly, normal guy really and I was just impressed as I've always been with him, just how many instruments the guy could play. Much maligned I think after that people only want to read about sex and drugs and how many women he had, how many children, if he got five children, I have no idea and does anyone talk about the music? I have no idea. - He was a musical genius. The Rolling Stones would not have existed without him. I think they should give him the kind of respect that he really deserves. And also, the other thing about Brian is that Brian's lifestyle, his very evident aura of hedonism was probably the first example of any British rock star living the rock n' roll lifestyle and maybe it's also that's a salutary warning as well. ♪ Everybody knows I killed Brian Jones ♪ ♪ Ask John, ask Paul, ask George and Ringo ♪ ♪ Go tell Mick he's the Charlton News ♪ ♪ It was me who put the poison in his swimming pool ♪ ♪ Everybody blames Billie Holiday's pimp ♪ ♪ I was holding her hand when she went limp ♪ ♪ Poor Amy Winehouse never stood a chance ♪ ♪ I switched the starlet for adulterated ♪ ♪ Under the counter plan ♪ ♪ Made damn sure Jim Morrison's bath was hot when it ran ♪ ♪ And a Grand Ole Opry on a Saturday night ♪ ♪ I got Hank Williams high ♪ ♪ When he took that last, last drive ♪ ♪ I'll never be satisfied ♪ ♪ I'll never be satisfied ♪ ♪ Now Robert Johnson at the crossroads midnight ♪ ♪ Did the deal with the devil blame another man's wife ♪ ♪ Give Lemmy his one last line ♪ ♪ With a pillow on the boys sing Rise, Lazarus, Rise. ♪ ♪ I put the spike in Sid Vicious' arm ♪ ♪ I tied the rope around and I walked to kingdom come ♪ ♪ I left the soap on the floor ♪ ♪ When Whitney Houston slipped in the shower ♪ ♪ I'm a mystery man, shot Tupac Shakour ♪ ♪ I'll never be satisfied ♪ ♪ I'll never be satisfied ♪ ♪ I'll never be satisfied ♪ ♪ I'll never be satisfied ♪ ♪ Everybody knows I killed Brian Jones ♪ ♪ Ask John, ask Paul, ask George and Ringo ♪ ♪ Don't tell Mick he's the Charlton News ♪ ♪ It was me who put the poison in the swimming pool ♪ ♪ Late one night in a Soho bar ♪ ♪ Some cat turns up with an old guitar ♪ ♪ He wears a candy striped suit ♪ ♪ He's got straight blond hair ♪ ♪ His name's Brian Jones, he's got a five yard stare ♪ ♪ Hey look there goes Brian Jones ♪ ♪ The real true leader of the Rolling Stones ♪ ♪ Hey look there goes Brian Jones ♪ ♪ Out somewhere in the old King Road ♪ ♪ Some sick kind of leader powders her nose ♪ ♪ She's got every single record by the Rolling Stones ♪ ♪ And she's just about the lay it down to Brian Jones ♪ ♪ Hey look there goes Brian Jones ♪ ♪ The real true leader of the Rolling Stones ♪ ♪ Hey look there goes Brian Jones ♪ ♪ Welcome to the bitter world ♪ ♪ You're hungry for the glitter girl ♪ ♪ Precious and bright unfurled ♪ ♪ You're hungry, hungry for the glitter girl ♪ ♪ Pause into the lineage ♪ ♪ Of any Trojan horse ♪ ♪ Gallop from your Mama's womb ♪ ♪ With no sense of remorse ♪ ♪ Skewering social intercourse ♪ ♪ You're on a treasure hunt ♪ ♪ That the only rope your heart ♪ ♪ Is just a missing part ♪ ♪ Welcome to the bitter world ♪ ♪ You're hungry for the glitter girl ♪ ♪ Precious bright unfurled ♪ ♪ You're hungry, hungry for the glitter girl ♪ ♪ Glitter girl, glitter girl, glitter girl, glitter girl ♪ ♪ Glitter girl, glitter girl, glitter girl, glitter girl ♪ ♪ Fill the hungry eyes ♪ ♪ You're set in place, your own demise ♪ ♪ Pick your markers like the one ♪ ♪ And hit the streets of Babylon ♪ ♪ Wearing lace and pearls and gloves ♪ ♪ You pride them all with floating love ♪ ♪ Welcome to the bitter world ♪ ♪ You're hungry for the glitter girl ♪ ♪ Precious ♪
