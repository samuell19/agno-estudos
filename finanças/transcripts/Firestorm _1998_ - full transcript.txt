We can't get through. - ( mother) Tina! - Mon?ca ) She's gonna be fine. Come on. You have to get into the ditch. Get down! Down! Monica, caII in Big Dipper! Jesse! Spike Camp, this is Smokeiump 2.

What's your Iocat?on? We're on the forest service road. Big Dipper, I'm gonna need a doubIe hit. I need one on my Iocation, and I need one a quarter of a miIe to the north, at the house. Smokejump 2, I can't h?t both pIaces. OnIy haHa Ioad Ieft. Oyer. House or road, Smokejump 2. Wh?ch ?s ?R Oyer. What's ?t gonna be, Smokejump 2? The road or the house? Oyer. Hit the road! Hit the road! OK, you've iustiumped out of a pe_ectIy good airpIane and Ianded in the top of a tree. Which is why we wear these othe_ise idiotic-Iooking suits. The fire's about five miIes away. You got a IittIe time, so Iet's review. You got a 10,OOO-acre fire, and it's breathin' right down your throat. Sherman! You aII right up there? Uh... yeah. Am I gonna have to come up there and get you? No, sir. You gotta get down now! Go! Go! Go! (Jesse) Remember, evey second counts here. Trust me, you don't wanna get caught in the path of a firestorm. OK, it's gettin' hot now. ReaI hot. At 300 degrees, trees expIode from their own boiIing sap. At 500 degrees, rocks expIode. So Iet's go. Faster! Faster! Faster! Aargh! Not quite that fast, son. - Who rigged the safety Iines? - I did. You think maybe you oughta shorten 'em next time? AII right. Get your gear together, head over to the pIane. Sherman! You know, I'm not sure whether you're tyin' to kiII yourseIf or you're tyin' to kiII me. But droppin' that PuIaski on me wiII cost you points. Yeah. I know. Itiust sIipped. Some smokeiumpers spend an hour each day poIishing and sharpening their PuIaskis. They'II give 'em names, carve designs in 'em. HeII, I've known some guys that have sIept with these things under their piIIows. Granted, they were IoneIy and disturbed men. Bottom Iine - never, ever, ever... drop your PuIaski out of a tree. - Got it. - No, Sherm, you don't got it. And you're gonna need a Iot more work before you do get it. Now, tomorrow mornin' I want you to report to the county crew chief. You're gonna have to pound some more ground before you fIy the sm. - But... - Sorry, son. That's it. ''Gonna have to pound more ground before you fIy the sm''? - Not bad, huh? How we doin'? - Prem damn good. Jee, these times are a Iot faster than I ever got down when I was in training. You had an exceptionaIIy useIess jackass for an instructor. - Wynt! - Wynt! - How's the new chief? - You gotta reconsider this retirement. - The new guy is an idiot, Wynt. - TotaI weaseI. - Oh, yeah? - I gotta cIean up some stud. - Hey, Pete, how's Jeannie doin'? - She keeps sayin' she wants that aIien out. - You got a name? - ''Wynt'' if it's a boy. - You don't have to kiss his ass any more. - ''Cowboy'' if it's a girI. - WeII, at Ieast she'II be prem. - Yeah. Mon?ca You shouId go taIk to him, Jess. Giddy-up. Look... eveybody wants me to ask you one more time. Are you sure you wanna do this? We've been over that. I can'tiump any more. Agh! You can stiII iump. OK, I couId iump. I iust can't Iand. It's over, Jess. I don't mind. - I iust can't heIp feeIin' bad about this. - Why shouId you feeI bad? If I hadn't gone in after that IittIe girI, you'd stiII be jumpin'. Ifyou hadn't gone a_er that IittIe girI, she'd be dead. WeII, what the heII are you gonna do? You gonna ret?re retire? Yeah, right. The pension we make? If I wanted to Iive in a refrigerator box... Nah, I'II get some kindaiob by the end ofthe summer. First I'm goin' to the Baia, do some fishin'. Speakin' ofwhich, I was wasting my time up on the ChiIkoot yesterday, where it runs through D4. They soId that track to deveIopers. I don't know if it's the winds or what, but it's dy as heII up there. Moisture IeveI's gotta be beIow seven per cent. Keep a cIose eye on it. There's somethin' I wanna show you. Oh, and I heard about the surprise pam tonight. - What surprise pam? - I toId you, I don't want anything, Jesse. I don't know what you're taIkin' about. Who toId you? Must have faIIen down behind the fiIe cabinet years ago. Found it whiIe I was cIeaning up. Your oId man had just been made chief. Looks funny with hair, don't he? - Do you think about him? - Yeah, I think about him. I think about him evey time I iump, evey time I brush my teeth, evey time I start my car. Jess, I probabIy wouIdn't retire if I didn't know the unit wouId be in such good hands. - Thanks, Chief. - You're weIcome, Chief. Ah, it's yours. You better get goin'. - You guys good to go? - You betcha. What a great day to fIy, huh? Boy, I'II teII ya, God gave us a good one here. You couIdn't ask for a better day to jump out of a pe_ectIy good airpIane. Oh! I'm pumped up! You pumped up? Let's go! Let's Ioad 'em up. You wanna give the money back? You think that's gonna square it? You don't know the kinda peopIe we're deaIin' with. You do not back out on peopIe Iike this. Look, iust do the iob and keep the money. Have a few Coronas and forget about it. A few bunnies'II get hurt, and I'm sad about that, but I'II get over it, OK? OK. OK, so I got it arranged with the four I toId you: Loomis, Karge, WiIkins and Packer. PIus me. That makes five. AII right? - ExceIIent. Who has the map? - WiIkins. WiIkins got the map. You've done an exempIayiob, Mr Davis. There's a Iot I can't do. We don't even know ifthere's gonna be another fire this year. - WeII, nature wiII take care ofthat. - Yeah? How the heII you think you'II get on the crew? These peopIe aren't stupid. Maybe they save money by Iettin' convicts fight forest fires, but they're aware ofthe risk. That's why they onIy Iet the short-timers on, not guys they think wiII rabbit. Don't wory your IittIe rockabiIIy head about it. I'II get on the crew. Yeah, right. I guess nature's gonna provide for that too, huh? No. That I wiII take care of myseIf. rguard) Davis. Keep moving. Shaye. You got a visitor. I spoke to the federaI prosecutor and the state attorney generaI. Ifthe money is returned, a Iarge amount ofwhich wiII go to aid the victims' famiIies, they'II transfer you outta here. Now, it won't be to some county cIub, but at Ieast you won't be spendin' the rest ofyour Iife in the hoIe. Yeah, right. Like a guy's gonna steaI $3I,OOO,OOO just so he can turn it back in! WeII? As much as I wouId Iike to get out ofthis den of pigs, I've toId you before, I can't heIp you. There's no money. I'm innocent. WeII, ifthat's the case, there's nothin' I can do. Here. Might as well sign this, Iet'em know I made the o_er. ( # ''Cat PeopIe (Putt?ng Outthe f?re)'' by Day?d Bow?e) - ( man ) Smokejump 1 to base camp. - (woman ) Go ahead, Smokejump 1.

TeII him to come on back. - Jesse says return to base, Andy. - Copy, base camp. - Come on. Let's go! - HoId your horses, Cowboy. Lots of roads run in and out ofthere. Doesn't sound Iike it's movin' that fast. We'II caII up County, have them send in a coupIe oftheir crews. (Jesse) D4. That oId son of a bitch. Surprise! I toId you I'd take care of it myseIf. Say hi to EIvis and Buddy HoIIy for me, huh? BeIcher. Benson. Bevins. Davis. Dwyer. Roger, county crew. 1I inmates Ioading. Due to arrive at quadrant D4, that's D4, at 0800 hours. Karge. Loomis.

No. I'm WiIkins. - Then you must be Mr Loomis. - We aII know who you are, Shaye. - Mr Davis is in the infirmay. - Then you're just about to join him there, paI. WeII, for your own financiaI good, I wouIdn't be too impetuous, gentIemen. It's aII part ofthe pIan. Mr Davis is faking an iIIness, and we'II be Iong gone before they discover that there are to Davises. He iust voIunteered to stay behind out ofthe goodness of his heart? No. He voIunteered to stay behind because of his desire for a substantiaI bonus. He wiII receive seven miIIion doIIars instead ofthe five miIIion each ofyou are getting. - HoId on, what five miIIion? - Keep your mouth shut, OK? What? What's your probIem? Davis said that we each get four. (argu?ng cont?nues) - Break it up, you _o. - I don't understand the discrepancy. I toId him five. WeII, he fuckin' said four. Having a nice meeting, boys? I said $20,OOO,OOO to be spIit four ways. Now, that's five miIIion apiece. Davis said to put it in a foreign account in his name, and that he wouId arrange payments. That son of a bitch. He thinks we're stupid. I don't see how he couId. Soon as we get cIear we'II get word inside. When Davis gets outta that infirmay - he's goin' into the morgue. - Just outta curiosity, what was he fakin'? I beIieve he said something about a pain in the neck. (b?rdsong) (b?rdsong stops) Damn. (bang) Hey, Sherman, we got company. Hoods in the woods! - I wouIdn't do that if I was you. - It'II be funny. - HiIarious. - Shh-shh-shh! Where were we? That's right, I was in the middIe of kickin' your narrow ass. That's right. Jeez, is that smoke up there? I don't see anything, Jess. It's probabIy iust steam from the factoy. Ready? AII right. Fire away! - Hey, what were you expectin'? This? - (Iaughter) Shit! You were right, Cowboy. That was funny. rman ) Hey, Chris, I need a hand here. - You better get to work and stop this shit. - My back. I'm teIIin' you, WiIkins, the other guys are workin' their butts o_. - Hey, ChiIds! - What? - ShouId we be so damn cIose to the fire? - You shouId be right where you are. You don't know shit about fires. I think you shouId caII and make sure we got a hope in heII of gettin' out aIive. I think you shouId shut up and get back to work. Righto, Chief. ..Iike, right in my neck. Hey! The fire's iumped! Don't Iet him get to the radio! Eveybody down! Nobody move! - Eveybody down! Hands on your head! - Stay where you are. - (firefighter) Don't shoot! - That means you, tough guy! Good job. - You have the map? - Y-Yeah, I got it. Thanks. Ah, shit. - What the heII happened here? - I naiIed the son of a bitch. But he got o_ a shot and he kiIIed Mr WiIkins. Good kid. We spIit his share. Right? Yeah, of course. Round them aII up. (Mon?ca ) Jesse. The fire in D4 has iumped the break and has headed south into the park. OK, caII in Wynt. TeII him he's not goin' fishin'. And caII that county crew on 24. I want 'em aII outta there. - Where are you goin'? - To get my hair done. Not so fast, Andy. You heard him. CaII Wynt. Karge! Karge! Come on, man, take me with ya! I can shoot a gun, man! We're iust firefighters, OK?! According to this, we take the service road right to the trading post. Why am I teIIin' you? You can read a map. You were a piIot, right? I know how. Not that I used 'em much. Maps don't mean shit when you're fIyin' at night. - Hey, is that tattoo stiII there? - Uh, no. No, it's not. - You get your training in the air force? - Yeah, then _o years in the brig. After that, weII... I feeI confident, knowin' I got a miIitay guy aIong.

The wind's gustin' to 30. TeII me about it. It's hotter than heII here. We've got eveybody on board the bus. As soon as I sign o_, we're gone. That is iust what I wanted to hear. CaII when you get cIear. Base out. Over and out. Have a IoveIy Iife, gentIemen. Hey, Sherm, stiII got your PuIaski? rman ) We're gonna die in here. - That is so nasty. - Yeah. Hey!

Ah, shit! - Smokeiump 1 to base camp. - (Mon?ca ) Smokejump 1, th?s ?s base camp. - You get that county crew on 24 outta there? - They were Ieay?n' as I caIIed. Good. We're gonna head over to L-11 and see ifwe can't sIow the son of a bitch down. When Wynt gets in teII him that new red bIob on his infrared is a bacMire. Jesse. Out. Don't we have to get authorisation for that? Right, Chief. L-11, here we come. (Shaye) WrestIer, huh? I Ioved wrestIing when I was a kid. Big guy Iike you must've been a badass. What'd they caII you? The Mad Monk. Shaved my head, wore a hood. Then I was AttiIa the Hun for a whiIe. But the wig kept sIiding over my eyes, so the other wrestIers beat the shit outta me. I hate to break up this get-to-know-you session, but where the heII are we? - You ever fight Bobby RenaIdo? - Loomis! CouId you shut up for a second? Look at the map, teII us how much farther to the tradin' post! - Hey, we're here. - Which means, my ever-impatient friend, that the road that we're Iooking for is right beyond that ridge. We're aImost outta here, boys. You ever kiII a man, Mr Karge? It reaIIy is quite exhiIarating, you know. Jesse's bacMire show on the infrared? (Mon?ca ) Just coming through now. Wind speed? Uh, base camp is at 20, gusting up to 40. 40? That shouId do it. Let's go check out the east fIank. Did we ever get a caII from County teIIin' us they were cIear? CaII 'em.

ToId ya I shouIda done it. - They're not responding, Wynt. - ShouId we caII the sheriff? - No, we're cIoser. I'II go. - You want us to go with you? No, you guys wait here. County might need you at any minute. Hey, Monica, keep tyin'. And Iet me know ifJesse gets back. (Loom?s) What the fuck...? - I thought you knew where we were goin'. - I do. - Did we go in a circIe? - No, that's anotherfire. Ifwe go aIong this ridge Iine we can probabIy outFIank it. Come on, we got time. Hey! Wait! - I'm so happy to see you. - rCanad?an accent) There's a big fire comin'. - What the heck you doing out here? - I study birds and I was... We gotta get goin' now. We'd aII Iike to get our butts back to AIberta in one piece if possibIe, eh? - AIberta? - We're down from Canada heIpin' out. - Can you take me outta here? - Righto. But no bike, eh? (bad Canad?an accent) Captain, couId we ask you somethin', eh? Go hury up and get your gear. Nice accent. I thought you were gonna throw somethin' in about Gretzm and the French. Do yourseIves a favour. Keep your mouths shut and Iet me do the taIkin'. What the heII are you bringin' her for? Are you kiddin'? A femaIe hostage - that's insurance. Piece ofthe fuckin' rock. - I'm not gonna take anything eIse. - AII right. - OK. I'm ready. - Hey, Iady. No worries. I can't breathe! - I can't breathe! - You're gonna Iet aII the smoke in! I'd rather die from smoke than roast Iike meat in a can! Jesse. Ground-pounders. What the heII are they doin' down there? They're waIkin' right into the bacMire. - I'II caII Monica. She can send in the pIane. - Too Iate. Take me down. - And Iand where? - Then take me up. Come on, Jesse, not again! You are notjumping... You're right, I'm notiumping. It's more Iike faIIing. Ah, shit! - So, you're into birds too? - Yeah. Oh, that's great, you know, cos I Iove 'em. I reaIIy Iove birds. I had one ofthe IittIe green guys, the parakeech, when I was a kid. It was great. - Go up and take the point. - AII right. - You doin' aII right? - Yeah. Good. Shaye. Shit. Argh! Hey! You aII right down there, Chief? WiII be when we get outta here. What the heII are you guys doin' here anyway? You were headed into a bacMire. - Lucm for us you're out here. - Luck had nothin' to do with it. - I set the bacMire. - You set it? We set 'em to draw oxygen away from the main fire. I'm afraid this one's runnin' hard on us. We're gonna need to get movin' now. Let's go. - For God's sake, man, get us outta here. - Where are the keys? Right out there. Anybody here know how to hot-wire a bus? We were headed for a pIace caIIed the tradin' post. Our chief said he'd meet us there. Good, cos that's where we're goin'. What the heII are you doin' at D4? - Not supposed to be anyone near that zone. - We were doin' a sweep for campers in D-3. I guess we must've drived into D4. Anyway, she's the onIy one that we found. Why were you on the ridge Iine? Guess it seems kinda stupid right now, but I thought it was the fastest way out. Fire runs uphiII. You know that. We'd no idea where we were untiI we were in the thick of it. You know us Ioan-out fire bums. Kinda green when it comes to the terrain, you know. Sure am gIad you dropped out. Hey, Wynt. Does the name RandaII AIexander Shaye ring a beII? - Yeah, wasn't there some kinda robbey? - Dawson Pass train robbey four years ago. He and five guys hit a federaI depositoy transfer train in a tunneI in CoIorado. Right. He buried eveyone aIive. The guards, train crew, his own men. 1I dead. He got caught, but not before he hid the money. I think we can safeIy say this fire was no accident. The firefighters say Shaye and his men took their shirts and heImets. Then teII the roadbIocks to hoId any fire crews. - What's wrong? Take in a IittIe smoke today? - Yeah, maybe a IittIe. (Shaye) Goddamn, that's one heII of a cIimb. Hey, nice goin'. Our chief ought to be here any minute now. Look, I'm gonna go and get some water. - Can I get anybody anything? - I thought it was cIosed. I got a key. Hey! When we get outta here, I'm gonna buy you a nice big Canadian beer, eh? Mr Karge... do you think that you couId take the fireman? - Yes. - Good. KiII him. What? Make another sound, I'II break your arms. Goddammit, you don't have to do shit Iike that. No, I do. I reaIIy fucking do. Mr Loomis, there's a Suburban parked right on the other side ofthose trees. You gentIemen kindIy take our guest and wait for me there. I'm gonna give Mr Karge a hand. In case you haven't noticed, we're not firemen. ( r?ngs out) Come on, Monica. Pick up, pick up, come on. You gotta be there. Hey, it's gonna be OK, cos I ain't gonna Iet him hurt you no more. You're iust our insurance, that's aII. You know, I was thinkin' um, when we get outta th'is, ifyou and I couId iust spend a IittIe time together... weII... you'd see that I'm a good guy. I took this, um, this cooking cIass when I was inside, and, uh... weII, I ain't no great chef or nothin', but I figure I couId get a good job. (wh?stIes) Now the finaI round. StiII undefeated. The man you Iove to hate. The Executioner. StiII undefeated. Hey! What's going on? What are you doing? - What am I doing? - Open the door, Shaye! I'm kiIIing you, you stupid moron. - Come on! - It's nothing personaI. It's... strictIy a matter of mathematics. - It is my money. - Open the door! - I wiII do this for you. - Open it! Ty not to think about it, you know. Just think about a happy time when you were a kid. Get out! I think you might need this. - Let's go. - rPacker) Wait, what happened to Karge? The fireman put an axe in his chest. But don't wory, he's burnin' in heII for it. Come on, Iet's go. Shit! We can'tiump in that! Yeah, I know. It's up to Jesse, but I say tiII these winds die down, we go heIp the ground crews in D-5. Hey! Where is Jesse? - He iumped! - He what?! We saw some ground-pounders in the woods between the main fire and Jesse's bacMire. They weren't firefighters. It was a prison break. How couId you Iet him do that? He saved your Iife. WeII, my dear, ifyou're Iooking for an aIIy in Mr Packer, I must caution you. The man has raped numerous women, amongst other barnyard creatures, I'm sure. That wouId make you a goddamn Iiar. I ain't ever raped no one. Why Iive in deniaI, Mr Packer? Be who you are. Let it aII hang out. And in your case, that's what's known as a sexuaI predator. Hey, Dr AuschIander said I was aII right. - He just said it was a chemicaI imbaIance. - ChemicaI imbaIance! - I know what chemicaI is imbaIanced. - (Loom?s Iaughs) Funny guy. Just kidding, Mr Packer. Don't be so sensitive. He's a pervy, Iady bird. rPacker) Fuck you! Before you got here the phone rang a few times. When I got to it the voice cut out. - What are you sayin'? - It couId have been Jesse. On what? One ofthe many payphones in the forest? There's a phone at the trading post, buttmunch. Not any more there isn't. Isn't that the trading post? - Mon?ca ) That's not part ofthe fire. - rPete) No. I'II get the sheri_to go take a Iook. You guys heIp the ground-pounders. Come on, Cowboy. (Packer) So, how are we gonna get outta here? Why don't you Iet me wory about that, huh? You can bet they've found that bus by now. - I'm sure they have. - There's gonna be roadbIocks eve_here. Mr Packer, why don't you iust keep charming your girIfriend and Ieave the thinking to those better suited for it? - We're not going by road, Einstein. - Oh, we're fIyin'? Too rism. Ifthey couIdn't fIy, neither couId we. - (Packer) So then what? - rShaye) They'II be watchin' the roads. But I doubt that they'II be watchin' the rivers. We're just gonna fIoat out. Whoa! Jesus! What's the chance ofthat happenin'? VirtuaIIy none. Get in the truck. - Go! - Hang on! Let's go. - Nice work. - We won't be seein' them again. - Get me cIose enough that I can kiII 'em! - Why kiII them? They're just runnin' away. Where do you think they're running? To Burger King?

They've got a boat to take them up the river into Canada. It's gotta be the Humber. They'II have to put in at Crane Lake. About eight miIes that way. The way that fire's behavin' on both sides of us, - that's the safest pIace to be. - So we shouId get there first. Sory to have to search you, but there's been a prison break, so we have to check peopIe... Sheriff. - There's a body in the store, Wynt. - Jesse? We won't know for a whiIe. Any sign ofthe rest ofthem? They couId be an_here. Wish we couId send up some pIanes, man. But we're smoked in, you know? Head back to headquarters. I'II caII you the second we hear anything. Thanks, Garrett. (Loom?s) I had to fIy down a canyon Iike this once in CoIombia with their internationaI guard a_er me. - Sounds Iike you were a prem good piIot. - Yeah, I was. Why don't we see ifyou stiII know how to fIy, huh? Argh! Loomis! Oh, God. What happened? We were iust taIkin'. He turned around to Iook at me. He sIipped. Jesus.

These guys are comin' across that river any minute. When they do, we're dead. We wiII be ifyou Iook Iike Big Bird. Lose the shirt. - This isn't too bad. I can pop it back in. - Right. - Might hurt a bit. - You're serious. This is not fixing a bird's broken wing. I need an orthopaedist, and you're a bird-watcher. - ( crunch?ng) - (Jesse grunts) - OrnithoIogist to you. - How'd you do that? Combat medic training, marine corps. Sempern. - You? A marine? - I may as weII have been. My dad's in the corps, third generation. Guess who was supposed to be the fourth. - Guess who wanted a boy. - Guess who got three girIs. Evey summer was Iike boot camp. I can't cook, but I fieId-strip an M-16 and shoot it at marksman IeveI. Set bones, tape sprains, stop bIeeding. And ifyou choke, I do a nim tracheotomy with a pocket knife and a baIIpoint pen. I chew vey carefuIIy, thank you. - So, Shaye, about my cut ofthe money... - Shh. (Iaughs) What now? We need to Iet some friends of mine know where we are. - Your dad teach you any survivaI training? - Yeah. He teach you how to start a fire with a rock and a stick? We were Iucm ifwe got a big and some mud. Prem cocm, huh? OK. Let's see how good you are. ( crackI?ng) Huh. They shouId see this at headquarters. Ifthey're not pIayin' Ping-Pong. Uh-huh. Like smoke signaIs. (femaIe reporter) Mr ViddeI, how invoIved are you in the escape? Can we have a statement? - Mr ViddeI, can you teII us what's going on? - I was Mr Shaye's attorney, not his friend. I'm as shocked and hor??fied as anyone by what happened here today. - The sheri_ ID that body at the trading post? - (beep?ng) - He's not dead, Wynt. - What? I mean he's not dead. Look. That's Jesse. Look at that. Son of a bitch. He can't stay there, the fire's runnin'. If he can get to Crane Lake before the fire does, he'II be fine. Oh, yeah? What's that? CaII the weather service, see if it's a coId front. If it is, those _o fires wiII coIIide and suck aII the oxygen out ofthe air. He won't survive, not even in the Iake. He'II be in the middIe of a firestorm. Dammit! The fire iumped ahead of us. It's movin' faster than I thought. - We'II iust have to wait for it to burn out. - They're right behind us.

So, what the heII were you tyin' to do here?! Burn us?! Ha-ha! Nice ty, asshoIe! Don't you ever shut up? Run! They're coming! Jesse! Jesse! Hey, what'd you run away for?

Cut me down, you seIfish asshoIe! Right now! With pIeasure. Argh! Hey. Hey. What's the matter? Does that hurt? You didn't reaIIy think I'd share my money with a piece-of-shit IowIife rapist Iike yourseIf, did you? Huh? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Hey, smokeiumper! You stiII aIive?! Hey, Jesse! ProbabIy not. (woman wh?mpers) Ifyou are, I got your girI here. Come and get her. (Shaye) WaIk faster. You know, I'm hurt. I reaIIy thought that you might thank me. - What? - Nothing profuse or anything. I mean iust a simpIe IittIe ''Thank you vey much for kiIIin' that rapist guy.'' But is that what I get, huh? No. No, what I get is aII this sIow-waIkin' I-gotta-tie-my-shoes crap. I warn you, don't test me. Now we're either a happy coupIe Iost in a huge disaster or I'm the Lone fuckin' Ranger.

She's a hostage. D4. No one's that smart. Not even you, Wynt. Why'd you do it? It was supposed to be a controIIed burn for a deveIoper. I needed the cash. Smokeiumping was aII I had. I've got nothin' Ie_ now. I didn't know about the prison break. - Why didn't you come to me? - It was just too Iate. - (Shaye) I'm sick ofyour shit. - Let's get that girI! - (Shaye) Do what I teII you! - (Jesse) I'II go behind the boat shed. - Wait here for my signaI. - Jesse! I'm sory. Race you down, Chief. Not this time, Chief. Move it! Get to the front ofthe boat and untie it. - Who the heII are you? - You and your Iawyer set me up! Oh, yeah, I know ya.
