Mr. Pike. - Aye aye, sir? How many more men to come, Mister? - Six, sir. I hope they're a better lot than the ones that joined yesterday. - Good morning, Mr. Pike. - Morning, Miss. - By the way, Mr. Pike, we've another passenger this voyage besides my daughter. - Another passenger, sir? - Yes, a Mr. Jack Pethurst. - Daddy, you never told me. Who is he? - A writer chap from the continent. Quite well known, I believe. He's going to write an account of the voyage for the papers. - That will be exciting, won't it, Mr. Pike? - There he is, I fancy. - Launch coming along side, sir. Here comes the crazy gang. Throw him a towel! - Oh, let the poor mug have a swim. - Look out, fellas, you'll wet your beak! Hey, we're gonna hang you on the yardarms to dry! - Hello there. Hello. What's the matter with you? - Oh, nothing, sir. What's your name? - Charles Davis, sir. What are you limping for? - Oh, I'm not limping, sir. All right, line up there. Cold, eh? We'll soon warm up, my lad. Fella your age, you're no seaman. - Well, if you really wanna know, old sock-- Don't take that tone with me! You say "sir" when you're talking to the officers of this ship, hear? - Oh, sure, sure. - Sir! - Sure. Sir. What's your name? Peabody, sir. We'd take a reef in that. Shorty will do for you. - Yes, sir. Shorty. - Now, listen to me, the bunch of you. Whatever you were before you came aboard, now that you're here, you'll work like men or I'll know the reason why. First man who bats an eye or even looks like batting an eye will get plenty. Now get forward, and be ready in half an hour to turn to. Get up! - I can't, I'm froze stiff. - Froze pike, you mean. Pick yourself up or you'll feel the toe of my boot! I don't think much of this lot, Mr. Mellaire. They look as if they're out of a prison hospital. - Not so easy to find men willing to ship on the Elsinore. - Why, what's wrong with the ship? - Oh, not much wrong with the ship, Mr. Pike. - So this is where we have to bunk, is it? - Say, aren't you Bert Rhyne? - That's me. - I thought I knew your face. - Aren't you with a tony crowd? - That's right. - Listen, my name is Murphy and this is me partner Kid Twist. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet you. Say, what kind of a racket is this? - Oh, it's not so bad when you get used to it. But you have to mix with a pretty rough crowd, though. Hey, where's your louse trap? - Louse trap? - Yeah, your bunk. Ah, you better come in with us. Hey, kid, get that Roberts out. - Hey, Steve Roberts, get out of it. Come on, Roberts, come on. Come on! Get out of it. - Come on, Roberts, get out of it. There you are, buddy. Make yourself at home. Thanks. - What's eating you, pal? - Someone's coming out. - Are they after you? - Right. - Leave it to me. I'll have a look. - Ah, Captain, I've brought your passenger aboard. - Hello, sir. - Let me introduce you. Mr. Pethurst, Captain West. - Glad to meet you. - How do you do, Mr. Pethurst? Mr. Pike. - Sir? - My mate, Mr. Pethurst, our passenger. - How do you do? - I hope you'll be comfortable aboard, Mr. Pethurst. We'll be getting underway shortly. - Thank you. - Well, my boy, you'll be all right here. Now, here's a little money in advance of royalties for your return journey. - Thank you, old man, and goodbye. - Goodbye, old chap. - Thank you. - Goodbye, Captain. - Me show gentleman a cabin. - Thank you, lead the way. - It's only a passenger, you've got nothing to worry about. - All the crowd are aboard now, sir. - All right, Mr. Pike. Soon as you're all ready for it, we'll get underway. - All hands for it! Come on, you fellas, time to windlass. Come along, you mugs, man the windlass. Ah, it's time, all right. - Man the what? - The windlass. - What the heck is that? - You'll soon find out, come on! - You men in the train, they're fine. Put your backs into it! - Gentleman comfortable here. In best cabin, sure. Captain's cabin. - Oh, good, that's very nice of him. - Mr. Pike, him plenty tough officer. Crew all bad men. Bad men. Pike catch him plenty trouble, you see. - Yes, indeed. Come on, Andy, let's see Mr. Pike. Heave! Oh, you dead fool, get out of the way! - I'll teach you to trade your monkeys off! - Oh, if that's the way it's done in this ship, we must have a look at things. - Mind your gear and stow that talk! - Look you, sir, first we must have an understanding. - Do as you're told! - Just a moment. The maritime laws strictly forbid the officers to use brutality in their treatment of the men. - All right, my man. - But, Mr. Mate, not only have you infringed the maritime laws, look, you, but you've also done. Sir, I call upon you for a witness to this awful, brutal treatment. - Surely the man should be given a hearing. - Mr. Passenger, I'll trouble you not to meddle with the working of the ship. Get on with your work, the lot of you! - Impossible. Absolutely impossible. Shove all the stuff back again. Don't you understand? Pack it up again. - Gentleman leaving? - Yeah, gentleman leaving. I'm going ashore in the tug with the captain. Put your backs into it! - Where's the captain, my man? Oh. I'm so sorry. - You're Mr. Pethurst. - Yes. - I'm Captain West's daughter. - How do you do? - Is there anything I can do? - No, no, no. You must excuse me, I didn't expect-- - Any females onboard? No. - I'm sorry, they should've warned you. You mustn't worry about me. I'm just like one of the crew. - Is this your first trip, Miss West? - Oh, no, I've been at sea with my father since my mother died three years ago. Cast off the tug, Mr. Pike! Aye aye, sir! - Oh. Well, if you stood three years of it, I suppose I can stand three months. Don't you ever get bored? - No, there's always something going on. Now, for instance. - What are they doing now? - Setting sail, it's worth watching. - Really? - Hold them! Down your hull! Heave on the main! ♪ As I was a=strolling down Ratcliff Highway ♪ ♪ Heave, heave-ho, blow the man down ♪ ♪ A charming young frigate I chanced to espy ♪ ♪ Heave-ho, blow the man down ♪ ♪ I hailed her in English ♪ ♪ She spoke me in Dutch ♪ ♪ Heave-ho, blow the man down ♪ ♪ So I backed my main yard ♪ ♪ And I hold my self to ♪ ♪ Heave-ho, blow the man down ♪ ♪ So up with the anchor ♪ ♪ We're off with the tide ♪ ♪ Heave-ho, blow the man down ♪ ♪ The sails are all set ♪ ♪ For the ocean is wide ♪ ♪ Heave-ho, blow the man down ♪ - That chap there, why is he glaring at you like that? - That's O'Sullivan, a good sailor, but not very strong in the head. - I shouldn't have thought this ship was a suitable place for a young woman. - Why not? - There are certain things I've seen here. - Oh, you mustn't be shocked by what happens on deck, Mr. Pethurst. The sea is hard, you know? How are they working, Mr. Pike? - They're a poor lot, Miss, but I'll lick them into shape. - You'll get used to the mate's little ways in time. He ain't nothing now to what he was 20 years ago when he was in the blue nose ships. He was tough then. - I've heard he'd hang a man by the wrists to the mizzen shroud. Yeah, but what did he do that for? - Maybe he spoke out of his turn. - He better not try any of that stuff with me. - Oh, he cannot cut those capers nowadays. No, there's laws and justice and compensations. Hey, look, beef stew! Ah, that's the stuff I like. - Get your hand out of that, you lug! - Oh, yeah, them fellas are like pigs in a saloon. - Say, what's that passenger doing aboard? - Maybe he's on a pleasure trip. - Well, a man that would go to sea for pleasure would go to Hades for a pastime. - He's an author, he'll put you all in a book. Land's sakes, I don't wanna be in no book! - I suppose you've spent most of your life at sea, Mr. Pike. - Yes, since I was 12. - Oh. - I was boy then in the Flying Cloud when she made the passage around the Horn in 89 days. 89 days from Sandy Hook to Frisco, sir. - When was that? - In 1860. Ah, them was the days. Half the crew in irons most of the time. Three men shot by the officers in one day. The second mate killed dead, and no one to know who done it. And drive, drive, drive. - Sounds rather uncomfortable. - Aye, it was rough. But that's all stopped. A sailor's a gentleman nowadays and only wants to lie on the hatch and watch the yards swing 'round. Can't lift your hand or your voice to them. Are you fond of music, Mr. Pethurst? - Why, yes. - With your permission, Captain. - Certainly, Mr. Pike. - You remember Captain Summer, sir? I do, indeed, Mr. Pike. - Saving your presence, Captain, the finest master I ever served under. When he was an old man over 70, his devil of a second mate caught him in his bunk and beat him to death for the sake of a few hundred dollars. - Did you know the man who did it? - I've never come up with him. But one day, I will. His name is Sidney Waltham. He pleaded insanity for having his head chopped open some years before by a crazy sea gull. He got seven years. He's free now, but he's got that mark unmistakable. He may change his name, but he can't change that. Sailors always drift back to sea, and, one day, Waltham and I will meet. Nearly eight bells, and time I was on deck. I wish you good night, Mr. Pethurst, and pleasant dreams. - Good night. - See you later, sir. All's well. - Aye aye. Sou'-sou'-east, nothing but windward. - Sou'-sou'-east, nothing but windward. - Sou'-sou'-east, sir. - Sou'-sou'-east. - All right, Mr. Mellaire, I'll take her. - Aye, aye, sir. - Mr. Pike seems to me a very fine type of officer, Captain. Real old sea dog. And I would say, without knowing anything about it, of course, that Mr. Mellaire is also a very able officer. Must be very interesting, your book. The Bible, Mr. Pethurst. - Well, Captain, I think I'll say goodnight. Goodnight, Mr. Pethurst. - Goodnight. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Are you keeping aboard? - Oh, yes. Of course, there doesn't seem to be much to do. - No. Care for a game of cards at any time, I'd be happy to give you one. - That's a very good idea. Why not now? - By all means. - No, after you. Sit down. Have a drink? - Thanks. - Here, help yourself. Well, what shall we play? - You know cribbage? - No. - I'll teach you, if you like. Real sailors game. - Good, I'd like to learn. - Gotta make your own amusement aboard ship, you know. - Yes. A fine lot of stacks you are. You can talk big in here, but no one would sit by me when I tackled the mate this morning. - And he sure made a mug out of you. - He will make bigger mugs out of all of you before long unless you will get together and stand up for your rights. Anyone would think that you were the first to try to get the better of Pike. - A seaman must know the law. Look you in the regulations, which are made for his protection. Now, I know sea law, and I myself will tell this Mr. Pike. - Pipe down, you windbag! What do you think, you control the rest of us? - Stop that row! Like a bellowing menagerie. Fella can't hear himself think. - Well, luck is with you, Mr. Mellaire. - Yes, it is for once and a while. - It's a darn good game. I'm getting the hang of it. Here. Will you give me another? - Sure. Now? Here's to your revenge. - It's my deal, isn't it? - Uh huh. - Come in. - Pardon the intrusion, Mr. Pethurst. Mr. Mellaire, there seems to be a good deal of noise coming from the fo'c'sle. Will you go and put a stop to it, please? - My watch below, sir. - I know that, Mr. Mellaire. - Excuse me, Mr. Pethurst. Duty calls. - Mr. Pethurst, I must ask you not to play cards or otherwise entertain my officers in your cabin. They have their duty to do. - I tell you you're wrong to set yourself against the mate. - What does he expect for a buck a day, Lord Nelson? - Hooray for Ireland! - Ah, hooray for Hades. - Well, every man for his own country. - Go on then, let yourselves be beaten. It's your own business. - I don't like your tone, Mister! - Ah, but he's right. - No, he's not! What's all this noise in here? Don't let me hear any more of it. - Good evening, sir. Yes? - Oh, good morning, Mr. Pike. Good morning. - Mr. Pike, may I ask you a question about the working of the ship? - You may, Mr. Pethurst. - How is the ship steered? - By a man at the wheel. - Oh. Well, who's at the wheel now? - O'Sullivan, I think. - Oh, no, he isn't. - Then who is? - Nobody, Mr. Pike. - What? - At the wheel! Mr. Mellaire! Find O'Sullivan and Mr. Mellaire, jump to it! Keep her as she goes. As she goes, aye aye, sir. - O'Sullivan! Where have you been? I'll teach you to leave the wheel! Get back to the helm, I'll talk to you later. Where have you been stowed away, Mr. Mellaire? - I haven't been stowed away at all, sir. - And where was your helmsman? - He was at the wheel when I left a minute ago. That man oughta be straitjacketed. - He's all right if he's properly looked after. Now look here, Mr. Mellaire, I'm not gonna argue the point with you. It's up to you to look after the ship. If this happens again, I'll have you logged. What do you want, boatswain? - Davis won't turn out of his bunk, sir. Says he's sick. - Oh. - You ain't gonna make it, my boy. - Don't you worry, shipmate, I know what I'm doing. Look out, here he comes. What's the matter with you? - I got pains all over, sir. Since when? - Well, when was it you struck me, sir? It is your blows that brought out the sores all over my body. - You lying dog! You! You were rotten before you ever joined the ship. - Ah, no, sir, no, I was very well. I did full duty as able seaman before the sickness got hold of me. All hands can testify to that. I know the law, you see, sir. I'll have to summons you before the court for your brutal treatment, sir. - You shut your sea lawyer's mouth! - That's right, strike me again and make my sickness worse. The court shall increase my compensation. - Not if we bury you at sea. And, let me tell you this, Davis, you ain't the first sea lawyer that's been dropped over the side with a sack of coal to his feet. Put him in the sick bay, boatswain. Keep him there. See that he doesn't infect the ship. - Come on, Davis, turn out. - So long, dirty old Pike. - Come on, get a move on, get a move on. - You're right, Mr. Mellaire, sir. It's risking the ship to put a madman at the wheel. - What are you doing here? Get forward, where you belong. You must keep the men in their place, Mr. Mellaire. There's plenty of work for them aloft. Keep them at it. - Heave-ho right. - Oh. So this is your hospital, eh? Yes. You've a cabin to yourself. You're lucky, and so are your shipmates. - It smells like a pigsty. Aren't you ashamed to put a sick man in here? - What do you expect, a sanitarium with nurses in uniform? - Ah, but look, you, this sickbay is in a foul condition. Were you agreed to that? - It's not too good for you. - Ah, get out, you old basket. - Avast there, heave to at the main! Now, how was that? - Sounds grand. What's it mean? Now there, you have me. - Can you climb? - Sure I can. - Up there? - Way up there you mean? Oh, of course, yes. Lead the way, sirrah. Well, here we are. How was that? - Not bad for a beginner. - You think your life has been a bit salty, don't you? - Oh, no, why? - Well, compared with all these husky sailor men. - I don't see why a writer shouldn't be a man, as well. - Now, that's awfully nice of you. Thank you very much. - Don't mention it. - You make a very pretty picture with the sea and wind and everything. - You don't have to pay me compliments, you know. - I know. But I want to. - You always do everything you want? - Mm hmm. It's the festival of life. - Be careful. I'm only a simple sailor girl. It might turn my hem. - I wouldn't mind doing that. Next time, I shall climb way up there, top of the mast, just to show you. - Then I'll take a picture of you. You can send it to. - To who? - The pretty girl who saw you off. - Oh. - I'm sure they'd be very impressed.

Dark night, when the moon's the other side. Creep into her cabin. She, lying there, sleeping so sound and soft. I'd pick her up gently, carry her in my arms. I'd put her in the dinghy, and when she wakes at sunrise, I'd show her the Elsinore far away on the horizon. Far away. - Good for you, me boy, but when the Elsinore is done, where will you go to then? - I know where we'll go. I'd take her to an island where it's warm always, with flowers and birds, and they're singing in the sunshine. - Yes, if you're gonna carry her off, you'll have to look lively now. - There's a fine looking guy aboard, and he's after her, too. - Didn't you see them up on the main top this morning? - Ah, they were huddling and cuddling, and she looked as though she liked it. - How's Cleopatra doing, Wada? - Cleopatra's very fat fowl. No lay them egg. - Oh, then we must have her for dinner. Oh, stop it, Andy. - Nice shooting, Mr. Pethurst. That pop gun ain't no use in a mix-up. Give me a good, handy gat when something's doing. - Are you expecting any trouble then? - Well, you never know, Mr. Pethurst. You never know. - Andy, come on, get down. Hi, your dog scared my chickens! - Oh, I'm so sorry. Andy! Come on. - What the blazes? Ah, it's that Irish maniac! After him, the murdering loony! Go on, get him down! Man overboard! Keep her close there! Man the loft from the mizzen top! - Pack the main yards! - Bear the main brace! All hands on deck! Boatswain, down helm! - Free away the lee boat! I've got him. Let me stay in the sea. Let me go, please, let me go, I don't want to. I want to stay in the sea. Will you let me go? All right, give way, give way, boys. - Come on out of there. Get up there! - Oh, why, what for? Oh, no, sir, that is impossible. I am a sick man, I cannot climb up there. - Stop squawking, do as you're told. - Oh, no, sir, no, you have not the right. Gonna be smart, eh? Get up! Take me out of here. Don't lash me up! Please, let me go. I can't do anything, let me down there. - Truss him up properly. - Let me go! I can't do it. Take it easy, don't lash me up, let me go! - Why did you want to kill me? - Because you want to take her from me. But she's not for you. She's mine! She's mine! Mine, I tell ya! - No use talking to him, Mr. Pethurst. The man is demented, Lord have mercy on him. Where are we now? - There, you see? 37 days out and roughly 300 miles east of the river Plait. It can be very nasty around here at times. - It seems to be very calm now. - You see that black line over the horizon? There's wind behind that. Probably a pampero. - What is a pampero anyway? - Thunder and lightning and wind like the wrath of God. - Your father seems to look forward to trouble. - Father loves the sea. He's always going to retire, but he never does, and I don't suppose he ever will. Hey, O'Sulivan, where are you? - Give that to me, here. - Ah, but where's O'Sullivan gone to? - Well, he's gone away. He was fed up, look, you, with being lashed to his bunk. So he went away. - Ah, go on. - Yeah, it's true. - Then I'll take his grub to the galley in case he comes back. - Oh, no, give that here to me, you. I am hungry this morning. - Here, no fooling, where's O'Sullivan? - Oh, he's gone home, back to Ireland to see his family. He was homesick, look, you. - The old man smells bad weather. Better see all clear for taking in the royals and the gallants. - Aye aye, sir. - Well? - Please, sir, O'Sullivan's not in his bunk. And Davis is acting very queer. - Where's O'Sullivan? - I gave him a crack on the head and put him over the side. Why did you do it? - Because, sir, because he bothered my sleep. Because he annoyed me. I hope the next time, better judgment will be shown to what kind of man is put in with me. Besides, that upper bunk ain't no place for me, and me a sick man. You cowardly-- - And what are you gonna do about it, eh? The man's dead, ain't he? And I did it in self-defense, mind you. I know the law. What right had you to put a raving lunatic in with me, and me sick and helpless? - Davis, you'll answer for this. Killing a loony lashed down to his bunk and harmless. You'll follow him over the side, my bucko. - If I do, you'll hang for it, sir. You daren't face a court of law with your record. I know that. I'll have witnesses to testify to your threats and brutalities. - Shut your mouth or I'll knock it out of your face! - You can't get my goat, Mister. I ain't scared of you. I know the law and my rights, and I got witnesses. - There's been murder on the ship, sir. - What? - Davis has done poor O'Sullivan. Put him over the side. He oughta be in irons, though he is a sick man. - I'll see him later. The lass is falling. We'll have to get some of the sail off her. - I think we're in for it, sir. Call the boats up and get the royals off her. - Aye aye, sir. Men, off to watch! 10 men to take in a pocket handkerchief like that. Who told you to come down that way? Get back under that yard! - You know, you lose your watch below and don't even get a shot of rum for it. - They ain't got no right to treat us men like dogs. - You're right. - You said it. - Hear come the big noise. - Look at you all. Worn out, eh? They treat you like dogs, and it darn well serves you right, too. - Go on, you pagan parasite. - You don't ever work yourself. - Ah, you'll go on working for Pike til you drop 'cause you haven't the guts to stand up to him. Well, it's your own funerals. But they'll be some of you who'll never see Frisco, I can tell you. O'Sullivan's gone under already, and you know what he died of. - Well, what of it? Kill a madman, it's an act of public welfare. Good riddance! And you, you're all as mad as he if you do not see that your officers are bullies and slave drivers. You should unite yourselves, the better to make them see reason, even if you have to use force! - Isn't it wonderful? - It reminds me of an English summer. - Don't you wish you were at home in comfort? - All that is over for me. I'm a new man. - What? - I said I am a new man. - Oh. That's the sea. - I've been to sea before, Margaret. Oh! - You must have felt like this before. - Never. - Is that the sea talking? - Margaret, darling. - Mr. Mellaire, what does this mean? - Captain, I didn't mean it. I lost money at cards, wanted to borrow. A moment of madness. - Mr. Mellaire, go to your cabin. You are under arrest. - No, I won't go to my cabin! We'll settle this now! - Don't play the fool, Mellaire! Give me that knife. You let me go and keep silent or I'll do for you! - We've been waiting for you, Mr. Mellaire. - I was detained. - Here. - Thanks. - Goodnight, Margaret. - Goodnight, Jack. - It's your play, Mr. Mellaire. - Captain West! Mr. Pike! Mr. Pike! The captain has been murdered. In my cabin. - Why him? You could understand it if they tried to kill me. That old swine Pike. But him? - Ready to go, Mr. Mellaire. - Huh? - Mellaire. Mr. Mellaire! Mr. Mellaire! - Mr. Mellaire. The mate's calling you. - Mate? - There's something funny about that guy tonight. - I wouldn't think it possible anyone could do such a thing. But I'll find the rat, and I won't need judge and jury to see that he gets what's coming to him. Company of the Elsinore, we're all assembled to pay our last respects to our captain, who met his death at the hands of a coward. Captain West showed us all a good example by his upright life, his fine seamanship, his courage, and his devotion to duty. He stood for all that is best in the service of the sea. His body lies here before us, but we know that his spirit is already at rest in safe harbor. We now commit his body to the deep. God rest him. Now, men, you've got a new master on this craft, and pretty soon some of you will find it out. To begin with, I gave the murderer til the end of the service to confess, but since he hasn't come forward, I'll put every man during his watch below in irons til the guilty man gives himself up. - Me, personally, I take no part in this. No, I'm a sick man. Right now, I should be in my bunk. But my shipmates have asked me for my advice since I'm in the law, which makes it my duty-- - Mr. Mellaire, put that man in irons. - I'll trouble you to be more civil, Mr. Pike. - Mr. Mellaire, put that man in irons! Shh! - Well, Mr. Mellaire, you hear me? - You're going too far, Mr. Pike. We want Mellaire. Mellaire, we want Mellaire. We want Mellaire. - Big trouble coming, Mr. Pethurst. We want Mellaire! We want Mellaire! - I'm waiting, Mr. Mellaire. We want Mellaire. - Don't move! - Sydney Waltham! - Hey, now you done it. - Mutiny, that's what it is. I'm having no part in this. I'm getting out of it. - Tie him up, Murphy. - It's mutiny all right, Mr. Pethurst. - Well, Mr. Pike, what do we do now? - Oh, don't you worry. We hold all the provisions. Before long, the rats will come crawling out and begging for food. But Waltham is in there, and I'm going to get him. First, let's see who we've got. There's you, Henry, Spig, good man. - They've got the boatswain, sir. - Louie, Tom, Andy. Where's the steward? - Pike, I saved Miss's hens. - If you take my advice, you'll give up this business. Mutiny never came to no good. You'll all be hanged ashore if you go on with it. - And you'll be hanged at sea if you don't stop your bleating, you old sheep. Lay down! - They're better armed than we are. What's the matter, lost your nerve? - No, but they got three of us already. - Then there's the grub. Aye, the grub's all stored up. We'll get the grub all right. - Give me that! - Who will, you? - Yeah. I will. Now, listen to me, all of you, I've pulled off tougher jobs than this ashore and got away with it. All you gotta do is take your orders from me and we'll be running this ship inside two days. But if you rat now, you'll spend the rest of your lives in jail. Those who don't hang. That's so, ain't it, Mr. Mellaire? - Yeah. That's so. - My friends, I tell you, your case is clear. If you curl under Pike, you are lost. There's only one course for you to take, to fight like men for your freedom. - Well, what do you say? We're all with you. Yeah, the boy's all right. - Right then, we're all set. Now, listen, we gotta have strategy. It ain't no use starting anything in daylight. We'll lie low until tonight, and then we'll let them have it! - Here. - Oh, good. Mutinies give one quite an appetite, you know? I'd feel a lot better if you'd stay in your cabin. - Oh, you needn't worry about me. I can take care of myself. - Now's the time. Stand by to rush them when you hear a shot. - Go on, you take this, I can't use it. - I got Pike, but it's too hot to stay up there, come on! What's the matter, you scared? Come on, let them have it! - That poop deck's a regular fortress up there. I got the mate, can't you manage the others? - That guy Pethurst is a crack shot, and the girl, too. - Three haven't come back. That's six today! - That's enough for one day. - You're right. - Well, I'll have a crack at Pethurst anyway. Come on! All right, I'll get you yet. Very dirty, no good man. - I believe you're right. Now go down and get something to block up the ventilator. - Yes, sir. - How's Mr. Pike? - Mr Pike, hit in head, knock him out. - Go on, go on. That stop funny business. - Now hold this a minute. How is he? - He doesn't know me, he's delirious. - Taking the guns. - There's nothing we can do. - We must just carry on. - You're in command now. - It seems to be pretty quiet in the fo'c'sle now, Mr. Spig. - Yes, but they won't stay quiet. We have another two months on this passage. And who's going to handle them? Not Pethurst. - Boatswain. - Yes, sir. - Come here. I want you and Louis to go up on to the main yard. - I ain't taking orders from you, Mr. Pethurst. Yes, you are. You have your orders. - Yes, sir. Well, jump to it. - I told you the sea was hard. - Well, Spig's jaw is anyway. - Fireworks, sir? - Oh, good, put it back there. Come, I'll show you something. Like this, see? - Would you mind telling me what you're doing? - Oh, it's just an idea that came to me last night. Little surprise for our friends forward, next time they should decide to call on us. - I'm fed up with this. We ought to come to terms with them. - Yeah. Terms. What kind of terms do you think you'd get? - We'd get something to eat anyway. - Say, mates, look what I found. - Rice. Where'd you get it? - Underneath the ventilator shaft. They must've stuffed it with sacks of rice. - What a break! Come on! Get up there and slit open the sack. I got you. - Quiet. Don't make any noise, they'll hear us. Look up, mate, look up. Get another barrel. It's good enough for a week there, don't lose it. Get another barrel. - Shh, quiet, quiet. - What is it, man? What is it? - Bad guys didn't like! Me poured it, split them up. Kill me, mates, kill me! Put me out of my misery, please! Kill me, I can't stand it. Put me out of my misery, please! Oh, it's awful, please, kill me, mates! - Are you gonna let them get away with that? We'll show the swine! Mellaire, you take one party, I'll take the other. - I've only got one shot. - Well, I'm short, too. You oughta know where the ammunition is stored. - Yeah, if I can get at it. The port door's weak. Might get through there. - Well, get through if you can. Anyway, shoot to kill! Murphy, you look after the girl. - I'll look after her. - And no quarter, mind! - Yeah. - Come on. And keep under cover until I give the word. Come on, boys! I'm all right. - You stay in there. - Waltham. - Well, come on out, boys. - Mr. Pethurst, I'd like to speak to you, sir. - I don't want anything from you, Davies, at least not until we meet in the court of law. - We're starving. - Be allowed to go back to work? - Now that's fine. Well, supposing all hands get sail on her just to show that you mean it. What we need, sir, is something to eat first. - And I want you to set the sails first, and you might as well know that what I say goes aboard this hooker. How was that? And after that, we'll talk about food. - All right, sir, we'll turn to. - Good. - We got a meal for them when they're through. - Aye aye, sir. - Go lend a hand, the rest of you. Aye aye, sir. - Well, that's cleared that up. - I'll go and see how your first mate is, sir. - Keep her full and by. - Full and by, aye aye, sir. - Go on, Davis, lend a hand. - What, me? Oh, no, I'm a sick man. - Aye? - I'm not in a fit state to work. I should never have left the sick bay. It is my back that is wanting treatment. - It's your backside wants treatment. Come on! Heave! - Well, Mr. Pethurst, it was a lucky day for the old Elsinore the day you came aboard her. - He's a real sailor. - You should have a good story for that book of yours. Steady as she goes.
