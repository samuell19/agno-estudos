What are you drawing, Celestine? A bear. And what’s that? That’s a mouse. And this is her friend. What? That’s not right. They can’t be friends! - Well, they are friends! - No, they’re not! - Yes! - No! No! A bear and a mouse cannot be friends. Alright, which story shall it be tonight? The Big Bad Bear? Yes, the Big Bad Bear! All winter long, the Big Bad Bear... sleeps. And when he wakes up, he is what? When he wakes up, he is hungry. And what! What is he hungry for? Just about anything? Absolutely anything! Lamposts, bicycles, benches, buses, bridges... Entire buildings! Oh! I..mean.. Oh! I, uh, mean... Absolutely anything! But of all these, what does the Big Bad Bear love to eat the most? A little mouse? ONE little mouse? Try ten... one hundred... one thousand... one million! Baked, roasted and skewered! Sautéed! Deep fried! Even raw! - Raw? - Especially raw! All alive and kicking, with their tiny little coats and backpacks. That’s what he likes the best! One hundred percent raw and alive! But, uh, how can you be sure he’s so bad? Do you know the story of the little mouse, who did not believe in the Big Bad Bear? Everyone warned her! “Beware of the Big Bad Bear!” But no... she thought she was so clever, so smart! the nasty little smart... Oh no, that’s not what I meant at all... the foolish little... the insolent... uh... Smart aleck! She refused to believe in the Big Bad Bear. She would say, “Oh no, the Big Bad Bear... that’s just a story the Grey One tells us at night, while she’s endlessly sipping her chamomile tea.” But she was wrong! Because one day, when she was... Did you draw this, Celestine? Listen to me, children, for it’s the truth! Mice can only be friends with bears in fairytales - - What’s she saying? - I have no idea. - What’d you say?! - I said I don’t know. Shhh... I can’t hear! It’s not like you can understand her! - Can too! - You cant understand a word! I could if you’d stop talking! You’re nothing but a big fat liar! What’d you say?! I thought you had perfect hearing - Silence! Hungry. Come here, little birdie... Nice little birdy... Come back, you nasty little creature! Come back! I said come back! The King of Candy Celestine! So, is it safe? Hang on. Let’s go! Look, Lucienne! Leon has lost his first tooth. Aww, our poor baby. And not a trace of decay. Oh, like a little pearl. Don’t cry, sweetie! Everything’s going to be okay. We’re going to put your tooth right here on the nightstand so the little mouse can find it. The little mouse? What do you mean the little mouse? Why, the little mouse fairy, of course! She comes when you’re asleep, and replaces your old tooth with a shiny new coin. Hmm, well what kind of coin is it? A huge coin! Your very first paycheck! The seed of your future wealth! Assuming you make all the proper investments, of course Hmm, okay... Well how come I’ve never heard of this tooth fairy mouse before? It’s because you’ve never lost a tooth before! That’s ridiculous! There’s no such thing as a fairy mouse, so it can’t be real. Oh no? Then where do you suppose our old teeth go? Well, uh... Sweetie, I have an idea. Why don’t you go to sleep now, and when you wake up, there will be a shiny new coin right there. How much will I get? Um, a quarter? Two. Well done! That’s my boy! Okay you two, it’s time for bed! - It’s a mouse! - Yes! A mouse? Where? Over there! In the teddy bears! Wait until I get my hands on you! Get out! We don’t want any mice in here! George! Do something! George! - Where is it? - Over there! Come out of there! Come back here, you beast! Hey! My tooth... and my coin! What about my coin? You dirty little... Keep it down, George. Leon is sleeping. George, garbage. My name is Ernest, I sing on the street, such beautiful songs, for something to eat. No bread in my tummy, no soup in my bowl, please bring me a cow and I’ll swallow it whole I’ve nary a bite, for many a night, I’ve lost so much weight, that I can’t get a date. My pants are so loose, I could eat a moose, so please wont you share, with your fellow bear? Ernest, Ernest, my name is Ernest. I’d like a roll, can you give me some dough? I don’t need a whole baguette, just one slice or two, how does that sound to you? And do you have any cheese? Ernest loves mommies and children the best, They’re brimming with goodness, much more than the rest. Would it be so awful to share some of that waffle? So warm and so sweet It would be such a treat Please don’t walk away, you’ll make my day, Just one little bite! Ask your mom, it’s alright! Honey, no! A morsel to spare, for this pitiful bear, Is there nobody there, to answer my prayer? A sausage, a steak, a chocolate souffle, some fancy fondue, and I’ll bid you adieu! You’ve got five days to pay. I’m hungry! No! Don’t eat me! Please don’t eat me! But I’m hungry. - What’s your name? - Ernest. I’m Celestine. We need to talk about this, Ernest! What are you doing? Bears only eat mice in fairy tales. You don’t still believe in fairy tales, do you? - But I’m hungry! - Come on! Use your head! Do you really think a little mouse like me will fill you up? Look at me Ernest, I’m nothing but skin and bones. Hasn’t anyone ever told you that the garbage is full of diseases!? I mean, there’s the flu, typhoid, hepatitis, cholera! Ernest! Do you want to catch a terrible disease? - Well, no, Celestine, but I uh... - Let me see. Nose is wet, glassy eyes, matted fur... Let’s look at the ears. And the teeth? Scary! What? Am I sick? No, but soon. Listen, Ernest. I can show you a place that’s filled with delicious treats for a bear to eat. Like marshmallows? Marshmallows, pinwheels, nougats, caramels, chocolate... gummy bears... okay? Okay! In there! Go on! Help yourself. No, wait. There you go. Bon apétit! Celestine! Thank you! You’re welcome. Out of the way! Dental floss, here! By the foot, or by the yard! And one and two, and one and two... C’mon, put your back into it, rookie! Cheese fondue, nice and hot! Come have a taste! There you go, ma’am, don’t burn your whiskers. Watch where you’re going, young lady! Sorry, ma’am, I’m in a hurry! It hasn’t started yet. They told us to wait here. Ugh... something smells like garbage around here. Did you hear? Hurry up, get in line! We don’t have all day. You’ll be in big trouble, if you don’t! So, how many did you collect? Uh, seven. Is that all? I got twelve. Twelve!? That’s nothing. I usually do even better. What about you, Celestine? How many did you get? Who, me? Stay right there. Relax, it’s a lot easier if you’re not so tense. This could hurt quite a bit... Next! Here you go, twelve teeth. Sure. I can do better, you know. Okay, next. Seven? That’s it? Yes, but these are incisors. And look at the quality! Incisors? I’ll take one. This one here is too short. Alright, let’s see how this one fits. Open! Repeat after me... “Beware the Big Bad Bear... for he will give you quite a scare!” ( unintelligible mumbling) Not quite there. Try again? “Befare of the Fig Fad Fare...” Allow me, please. Now then, one more time. “Beware of the Fig Fad...” Enough! Again, please. “The Big Bad Bear...” “Beware of the Big Bad Bear, for he will give you quite a scare!” There we go. It’s all in the wrist. - In the wrist. - What!? Only one tooth! What were you doing all night? But I was stuck in a garbage can. Yeah? And how did you get out? Actually, a bear... A what? No, no, nothing... Then you won’t mind if I look inside your bag? Ah! So this is how we’ve been spending our internship? Drawing pictures, instead of gathering teeth? You’re never going to become a dentist that way. But, I don’t... I don’t want to be a dentist. Hmm? Oh, I see what’s going on. You’re behind 50 teeth, Celestine, and you don’t think you can possibly catch up. But all you need is a little bit of motivation. Come with me. Look here, Celestine. You and I are rodents, we are not bears. Our strength is not in our body mass, our muscles, our claws, our ridiculously large jaws. No! We are far more delicate creatures. Elegant, refined. Look at our entire civilization, Think of our achievements over the centuries. To what do we owe them all? Well, what? Speak up, my little one. - Our incisors... - Speak up! - Our incisors. - Our incisors, exactly! They are the foundation of our society. Thanks to them, we have built the greatest cities... gnawed our way through the hardest stone... constructed the most complex machines... and we have rerouted the largest rivers in the world! And all thanks to our adorable, our precious, our invaluable, our delicate and yet perfectly precise cutting tools, our incisors. But, what happens, Celestine, if a mouse loses one of their incisors? He dies. In agonizing and unbearable pain. He can no longer eat, or speak. He dies. Tormented by hunger. Let’s review again from the top. What kind of tooth is the best replacement for a mouse’s tooth? - A bear’s tooth? - Indeed! Bears have the hardest, and most durable teeth. And the easiest bear teeth to find, are the ones that bear cubs place under their pillows. So, Celestine... You’re going back up there. and get as many teeth as possible from those morons. Okay? I do not want to see your whiskers back down here, Celestine, until you have collected no less than 50 teeth! Is that clear? Fifty teeth, Celestine! Fifty teeth... Good luck, Celestine. Are you coming? Yeah! I’m coming! I’m coming! Wait up! Welcome! Welcome children! You hungry? Can I have one cream puff, please? Of course, I’ve got one right here! Bag of lemon drops, sir. Okay! Here’s your lemon drops. Five lollipops, and some marshmallows. Yes, very good choice! Here you go. Right, there you are! Who’s next? - Some candy canes, please. - There. Thank you very much. Strawberry ice cream please, Dad. One ice cream coming up! Wait a minute! Over here... I’ve already warned you. You are not to have any sweets! Not ever! - But Dad... - Listen to me, mister! You are forbidden to have the slightest bit of sugar. Do you want your teeth to rot right out of your mouth? Do you want to end up across the street, at your mother’s shop? Huh! Is that what you want?! Go on home right now. This isn’t over. Ah, Mister Schubert, it’s so good to see you! How are you doing today? Fine, just fine. I need a new tooth, so I can eat my toffee. Oh, I see... Now what were you thinking? An incisor... - Or perhaps a canine? - No, I need a pre-molar. Let me see, let me see... Aha! Here we are! I have the exact model you need. It’s a pre-molar of premium quality. Try it out! It’s perfect. I’ll take it! There you go, buddy. And what about you, sweetie? What can I get you? Candy canes? Cotton candy? How about some jelly beans? I just want marshmallows. Marshmallows? Why, of course... I’ve just run out. No, no, no! Don’t cry my little one! I have more downstairs. Don’t move. I’ll be back in just one second. What are you doing in here? A thief! Get out! Watch out! You’re breaking everything! Oh no you don’t! I’m calling the police! POLlIlIIlCE! Ernest? - My marshmallows! - MY marshmallows! POLlCE! POLICE! Over here! He stole all my candy! Here! Look! This is him, you see? Okay, what’s going on here? Wait, Ernest? This morning you were panhandling, and now you’re robbing candy stores? How did you even get in there? There was this little mouse, and she... - Uh... oh... - A little what? I just got a bit hungry, okay! Okay, come on. Hey those are mine! Give me my marshmallows! Stealing from honest working folk. No respect. Psst... Ernest, it’s me. Do you need help? Do you want me to set you free, Ernest? If I set you free... will you do me a favor? It’s a big favor, Ernest. If I set you free, will you do it? It’s a really huge favor, Ernest. Will you still do it for me? The biggest favor in the world? Yes! The biggest favor in the world. Can I get some more peas for you, sweetheart? I’d rather have candy. Come on Leon, don’t start this again. We’ve told you a thousand times, you are not allowed to eat any candy, and that’s final. But how come? Well, that’s simple. It’s supply and demand. Daddy rots peoples teeth on one side of the street... And mommy replaces them on the other side. And one day both businesses will be yours. Which means you are going to be doubly rich. So long as you keep smiling at the customers, of course. And as your grandfather used to say, “To have a beautiful smile you must have healthy teeth.” Listen carefully, Leon... To make money, we need to rot other people’s teeth. But not yours. Do you understand? Yeah. Good. Well I’m up early, so it’s off to bed. Tomorrow I have to replace all the candy that Ernest ate. At least we don’t have to worry about anything like that happening at my store... I mean, who would ever want to steal teeth? Over here, Ernest. Hurry up! This is it. Right here. Okay. Here we go. Stop, wait! You’re making too much noise. Be careful! Stop it! You’re going to wake everybody up. All done. Here we go. Ernest! Wait! Alright, so where are the teeth? They’re probably stored in a safe somewhere. Like that thing over there? Yes, that’s it. I’ll go and pick the lock. No need to. I can handle it. Handle it? But what are you... No! That’s not how you’re supposed to do it! - I got it. - What is wrong with you? What? You wanted it open, right? Hey, wait! Aren’t you gonna help me carry this? Oh, no. I’m too tired! You promised me, remember? One last thing and then we’re even, right? We’re even. Wait here, I’ll check if the coast is clear. Got it. Okay it’s clear... Ernest, wait! Bears are heavy sleepers. Especially in the winter time. Celestine!? I thought I told you to not to come back here until... Celestine, I... look at this! Look at... I can’t, this is... this is fabulous, how did you? Bravo, Celestine! I am so proud of you! Hooray for Celestine! Celestine! Celestine! Celestine! Celestine! It’s... it’s the Big Bad Bear! - Ernest? - Celestine, you know him!? And did YO U bring him here? It’s her! I warned her, but she refused to believe. Everyone told her, “Beware of the Big...” Celestine, I uh... Ernest, this way, hurry! C’mon, Ernest, we have to jump! There! He’s over there! No Ernest, that way! Excuse me, excuse me! Ernest, we can get out through the tunnel over there. Go left, look, there! Ernest! It’s terrible! I’m sure I had everything locked up. A mouse! In the van! Ernest? Stop right there! Get out of there right now! Don’t you dare, Ernest! Come out now! You let them escape! What are we going to do now? What were you thinking, Ernest? Why did you stay down there? Are you crazy? Hey, I dozed off. It’s not my fault. Well it’s not mine, either. You’re the one who brought me down there in the first place. But I couldn’t carry the bag by myself! And besides, you never showed me where the exit was. You said you could find it on your own! I did? Ernest, give yourself up and turn yourself in! Ram him! Now pull over to the curb! Okay! If you insist. We’re not gonna let go, Ernest! Just watch out for the lamp post, then. Ernest, turn yourself in, we’re not giving up! Well, this is my turn. See ya! NATlONAL POLlCE United we fight! End of the line. So long, Celestine. What do you mean, “So long, Celestine?” I mean, I’m home. Well, what about me? You? I have no idea. This is my home, I guess you go back to yours. But Ernest, I don’t have a home! You saw, they chased me out. Celestine, we made a deal. You said it yourself, you set me free, and in exchange I do you the biggest favor in the world. - Please, Ernest... - So there. Now we’re even. What? Even? But it doesn’t count. Things have changed! Sorry, no mice in the house. Ernest, will you just listen to me? I already told you! No mice inside the house, ever! You let one in, you get a thousand. That’s what you all are like. Just ask any bear. Now scram! But, Ernest... I said no mice allowed inside the house. Out! C’mon Ernest, you have to understand things are different now. No mice inside the house! - But... - No buts! - Ernest! - I said no! No... mice... in the house! And stay out! Thank you. Celestine, I told you! You know you can’t get rid of a mouse, Ernest, any bear will tell you that! Unless you kill it. Your chocolate’s burning. You want to kill me, Ernest? You can forget about the broom, I’m too quick for that. I suppose you can try the mouse trap... but we all know that one. It’s the oldest trick in the book. So, I doubt I would fall for that, either. That leaves... rat poison, or glue traps. Those glue traps are terrible! The poor little mouse gets stuck, and she can’t get away, and so she gets so scared, her heart starts to beat so fast too fast... and then finally her heart explodes! Is that what you want, Ernest? For my heart to explode? Of course not, Celestine. but it’s just that a mouse and a bear, It seems so... you know... So what? Improper? Is that it? Bears above and mice below? Well, yeah... It’s always been that way, you know? Fine. Have a cellar? Yeah, but why... Okay, I’ll go down there... and you stay up here! - But... - No buts! Good night. And you better stay upstairs. And you stay downstairs, Celestine! I don’t want to see you, or hear you. My chocolate! There she is! The one who refused to believe in the Big Bad Bear! Everyone told her, “You must beware of the Big Bad Bear!” Wake up, wake up. It’s okay Celestine. Don’t be afraid. Celestine, I’m not your nightmare. It’s me, Ernest. Ernest, what should I do? Calm down, calm down. Wanna tell me what’s bothering you? I have nothing! I’m all alone in the world. Nobody loves me and I don’t have a home. Oh yeah? Well what about me? Does anyone love me? Did you draw this, Celestine? It looks wonderful! It looks exactly like me! If you can do this, you can do anything. Take it from me, you are a great artist. But that’s it! That’s why I’m alone. They don’t like my drawings. They want me to be a dentist. Yeah, I know just what you mean. It was the same with me. I wanted to be in theater, to play music, to perform on the stage. But no, they wanted me to become a judge. Like my father, and my grandfather, and my uncle, and my great uncle... “Go play your silly music somewhere else!” “Ernest, quit pestering us with your stories!” “Stop singing, Ernest. You should be studying your law books.” My turn! “No, Celestine!” “You have to stay downstairs!” “I don’t want to hear you, or see you!” There, much better! I have an idea... Grab all you drawing stuff, and follow me. We’re going to make you a studio. A proper artist’s studio. This will be my first real painting. So, what are you going to paint? The Big Bad Bear, of course! There. Okay, look ferocious! Like this. There you go. Lift up your leg. Perfect. Now don’t move, Ernest. And keep looking ferocious. - Can I see it ? - I said don’t move! Ernest? Are you okay? It’s just a little cold. Into bed, right now! Lots of water, Ernest. When you have a fever, you need lots of water. No! No! Stop, what are you doing!? Ernest, calm down. Ernest, I’m not your nightmare. It’s me, Celestine. Are there any marshmallows left? Of course. Don’t eat them all, okay? Of course I won’t. Do you promise? Cross my heart. - Good night, Ernest. - Good night... Hey Celestine! Guess what? I’m all better! Yep, take a look at this! Ta-da! Bet you can’t do it with four! You wanna bet? Let’s do it again! Come on Ernest, get up! ... the chief of police confirmed that warrants have been issued for the arrest of the two burglars... Are we the burglars? ... the arrest is imminent, and authorities expect to have them in custody in a matter of days. No, I’m sure they’ve forgotten all about us. We will not rest until we have the perpetrators, Ernest and Celestine, in our custody. The department has already formed search parties - To force them out of hiding... - However long it takes, months if necessary, they will be located and captured! We cannot sit by and allow their actions to go unpunished. They will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Ernest will receive no mercy. Celestine will be severely punished. The authorities are moving swiftly, to bring these two criminals to justice. The crimes of Celestine strike at the very heart of our society! Ernest will receive the maximum penalty. Justice will be swift and severe. Ernest and Celestine will not get away with it! Ernest, did you call me? No, Celestine. Everything is just fine. Yeah. Just fine. You’ve made so much progress, Celestine. I’m tired of drawing the Big Bad Bear. Really? Well, can’t you think of something more interesting? I wanna go and paint the outside. You’re gonna have to wait ’til spring. Us bears know all about that, waiting until spring. But all the snow will be gone. Oh, Celestine wants to paint the snow. Celestine wants to paint the snow... Okay artist, go to work! Thank you, Ernest. And now, I present to you... winter! If it was a song, it would sound just like this. Celestine... Ernest, the van! What about the van? It’s like a big red target! They’ll know that we’re here... There’s only one thing to do, Celestine. Ernest, come look at these strange fish! Nah, that’s okay. I see them. But don’t you want to see them close up? No, no, I can see them just fine. Come on, we should probably go back now. ... the search remains active. The authorities have vowed not to rest, until Ernest and his accomplice Celestine are safely in police custody. Yes. It’s true. If there is anyone out there, who thinks they may have... Don’t worry, Celestine. They’re never going to find us. No leads are too small, all leads will be investigated. the police are still looking for the two suspects, Ernest and Celestine... - What was that? - Was it the fairy mouse? George, go see what happened. My van! My store! Is this paint? Ernest! Lucienne! Lucienne! Call the police! I know where Ernest is! Good morning! Look how sunny it is! Oh no, is the Big Bad Bear grumpy? Does the Big Bad Bear not want to wake up? Is the Big Bad Bear gonna eat me? Good idea. Then I could sleep. Then I better give the Big Bad Bear a nice big breakfast... That way I can live to see another day. That’s pretty tasty. How can you possibly sleep in on such a sunny day? Ernest, come look! I have an idea. We can hide you in the cellar. But wait, Celestine. We have to hide you, too. Don’t worry, I have a plan. A plan? Celestine, are you sure about this? Don’t worry, Ernest! Celestine... He’s in here! Go, go, go! Where is Ernest? Uncle Ernest? Uh... He went to town, to buy some honey. He’ll be back tomorrow. For the last time, Celestine... Where is Ernest? Very well. You had your chance. I’ll ask you one last time, Ernest... Where is Celestine? Alright. But don’t say I didn’t warn you. Heave ho! Heave ho! Now release! Read all about the trial of the terrible Ernest, right here, in the Mouse Weekly! The shocking scandal of Ernest, and his accomplice Celestine. Hey look! That’s him! Over there! All rise for our honorable judge. You may bring in the accused. Will the accused please stand, and state your name? Celestine. Alright, then... Will you please tell us where the bear Ernest can be found? For the last time, tell us where to find Celestine! Very well! Then I shall be forced to charge you twice. First, for all of your crimes, And second, for the crimes of Celestine. Celestine! What has she done wrong? - She’s done nothing! - Nothing? Nothing!? She brought a ferocious bear into our midst. Is that what you call nothing? But he’s harmless! He was just hungry, that’s all. Do you want him to starve to death? Shame on you! As fat as you all are! Do you know how heavy a bag full of teeth is? - I had to carry it for her! - Silence! And she doesn’t even want to be a dentist. So there! Silence! That’s enough! Ernest, you and your accomplice Celestine, have been accused of the following list of heinous crimes: breaking and entering a business, grand robbery, theft of a car, evading of arrest, destruction of public property. To which, there are witnesses! A countless number of witnesses! But what is worst of all, Ernest, you have been accused of a most dispicable crime... you, sir, frighten our children! Children, do I frighten you? Me? I frighten mothers? Madame, do I frighten you? No, uh, um... It’s a mouse! And now, we will hear from... And now, the defense will present their case. Ladies and gentlemice, and honorable judge... What is my client being accused of?! Being a bear! - What’s he saying? - I don’t know. - What was that? - I don’t know! Will you please keep it down? You understand what he’s saying? - Perfectly. - Liar! You cannot. Order in the court! Quiet! Celestine, in light of the accusations... That’s enough! All I’m guilty of is being friends with a bear. And that’s not a crime, is it? What? How dare you! All of you are just being prejudiced! Yes, Celestine is my friend! That’s what you accuse me of? For being friends with a mouse? “Bears above and mice below,” is that it? Is that really what you want to teach your kids? To be afraid of a tiny little mouse? You want them to be dumb or something? Silence, Celestine! You’re the accused, not the lawyer. You will come to order or I will clear the room! I will clear the room! Clear the room! Come back here! Celestine, let me be absolutely clear! Nobody questions the foundations of our society. Least of all a mouse! But Your Honor, if you would just listen... Silence! Sit back down! Wait, what are you doing? He needs help. I’m sure he’ll be alright, let’s get out of here! You stay back! I want you back in your box where you belong! That is an order! But Your Honor, you’re on fire! That is enough! Take your seat! Don’t make me say it again. Get down from there. Get down from there this instant! I will not tolerate this behavior! Let go of me! I said unhand me sir! Let go of me! Your Honor! Come on, quick, let’s go! We have to get out of here. Let go of me! Have you lost your mind? Where is everyone? Everybody left, and we should, too. They abandoned me. But not you... We have to go now, come on. Tell me, Celestine, if we get out of here alive... what will make you happy? To find Ernest, and to stay with him forever. Alright. But really Celestine, living with a bear is such a strange idea! But why? You live with a bear, don’t you? Yes, I do. Such a strange idea... Are you okay, Your Honor? What just happened? You caught on fire, Your Honor. Ernest, you saved my life. How can I repay you? - Well, it was nothing. - It was NOT nothing! Now tell me, what would make you happy? - You mean now? - Of course I mean now! Finding Celestine, and staying with her forever. Then you are free. She saved my life. Celestine! Celestine! - Celestine! - Ernest! Ernest! Ernest! No, Ernest. - We can. - No. No Ernest, it’s just not possible. But I think it is. And I say no. We can’t possibly tell our story. It’s too sad. You found me in a garbage can, and then you tried to eat me. - It was a joke. - Well it wasn’t funny! No, I don’t want to tell anyone. We can just change it around a little... Imagine this, you were just a tiny thing, left lying in a trash can... an abandoned baby, your eyes weren’t even open yet... Draw it, Celestine, draw it. I was a street sweeper, sweeping up the leaves from the sidewalk. You know? And that’s when I heard it, the faintest little noise... Was it me? Yes, it was you. And then what did you do? Well, let’s see. I picked you up out of the trash, and I slipped you into my coat pocket. - And then what? - And brought you home. And you seemed so happy that I decided to keep you. I made you a little bed, next to mine. And we started to live together as a family. And that is the story of how we met. And after this, will there be other stories, Ernest? There will be plenty of other stories, Celestine! Dubtitles: David Jesteadt
