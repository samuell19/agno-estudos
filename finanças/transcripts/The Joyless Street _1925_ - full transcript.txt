None of the original prints of "The Joyless Street" have survived. Several acts of censorship systematically destroyed the film in Germany, while foreign versions were also extensively cut or altered. The following reconstruction was pieced together using foreign prints of the film. More than 600 of the film' original 3,738 meters are still missing. This amounts to about one half hour of the film. Out of the film' 200 original intertitles only five remain. The wording of the intertitles is partially based on a 1926 censorship report in which a shortened version of the film was documented. The rest of the intertitles were taken from the original script or retranslated from foreign copies. As long as sections of "The Joyless Street" remain lost, any reconstruction is at best only an approximation of the original version. The Munich Film Museum edited this version of the film over a period of many years, under the supervision of Enno Patalas, Jan-Christopher Horak and Stefan Dr?ssler. The music was composed by Aljoscha Zimmermann. THE JOYLESS STREET Act 1 Act 1 Vienna, 1921 MELCHIOR ALLEY TOMORROW MORNING: FROZEN ARGENTINEAN MEAT The tyrant of Melchior Alley: Josef Geiringer. Living in the cellar of a house in Melchior Alley: The Lechner family. "Marie's not back yet with the margarine." On the first floor of the same house, lives Court Counselor Rumfort with his two daughters, Grete and Mariandl. "Cabbage again!" "Mariandl, if you eat up nicely, there'll be meat tomorrow." Marie, the daughter of the Lechners. "What, you got no margarine, you street walker? You were at your boyfriend' again, weren't you?" "I must get to the butchers, Father. They'll be queuing there all night." "But you have to be in the office early tomorrow morning." MY DEAR EGON, PLEASE TAKE ME INTO YOUR FLAT. YOU DID SAY WE'D MARRY SOON. EVEN IF I HAD TO WALK THE STREETS FOR YOU; I'D DO ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF THIS HELL! YOUR EVER-LOVING MIZZI "Well, what is it? You have to queue at the butchers, you know." "What's all the pushing here? I'm calling the police!" Miss Greifer: Owner of the fashion salon across the street, and the second most powerful person in the quarter. "What? A winter coat? Well, did you pay me for the dress?" "For a whole week you've earned nothing at my place!" "But, Madame, I was so nice to the gentlemen. It'snot my fault." "Madame, could I stay away tonight? I have to queue at the butchers." Meanwhile in another district at the Carlton Hotel... Don Alfonso Canez of Valparaiso checks in with 10,000 dollars in his pocket, and the express intention of making half a million within three weeks. "I'm expecting Mr. Rosenow, Director General of the Central European Bank." "Mr. Canez, a business friend..." "My wife..." "...and my daughter, Regina." "I've got a proposition for you. Vienna is freezing. Vienna needs coal, but the Petrowitz coalmines don't have the funds necessary to produce..." "Mr. Egon Stirner, my private secretary..." "We'll launch a rumor of a strike. When the shares fall, we'll buy them at rock-bottom price." "Upon clarification of the rumor, the share prices will rise. Then we'll sell and make half a million in gold!" "My lawyer, Dr. Leid and his wife." "So let's be brief. You want to make me a declaration of love in this romantic setting..." "...naturally because of my wealth!" "Save your words. You will say no, and I still won't believe you!" "What must I do for you to believe me?" "Well, you have to become as rich as I am, or I as poor as you. Then I could believe you." "Very well then, I will try..." "HOW you earn the money makes no difference to me." "I'm abducting your beau, Regina." "So, and now I want you to show me where you were just then with Regina." "And now you will repeat to me what you said to her here." "No, not here, Egon. I'd rather do this in a dark, dangerous house where there are real cut-throats!" "I only know a small hotel in Melchior Alley. Sometimes there's a good deal going on in there." "Yes, you'll wear a fake beard and I'll veil myself, so no one recognizes us. Just like in the movies!" "You go home without me. I still have a lot of details to discuss with Canez." "You may obtain your money THIS way as well, if you wish..." "It was outrageous, the way you flirted with Canez today." "Surely you can't deny that my daughter is pretty and a good match." "...and now I will show you the famous Viennese night life!" End of act 1 Act 2 Act 2 Behind the facade of her fashion salon, Miss Greifer runs a private club. "To beautiful, gay Vienna!" "And to the world-famous merry girls of Vienna!" "Counselor, you must come with me right away, or we'll lose our places!" Six hours later the majority of those waiting knew there was no meat left for them. "I don't dare go home without meat!" "Those two girls knocked on the cellar window just now, you know..." "This is my husband..." "Divide it and give her half." "For three months now we've been unemployed and homeless..." "The innkeeper at least allowed us to sleep in the stables." "Keep all the meat." "I don't need it anymore. I'm not going home again." End of act 2 Act 3 Act 3 AUSTRIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACT REGARDING THE REDUCTION OF CIVIL SERVICE, MAY 3, 1921. CIVIL SERVANTS TAKING VOLUNTARY REDUNDANCY RECEIVE TWO FULL YEARS SALARY IN ADVANCE, PAID OUT IN CASH. EGON STIRNER, CLERK CENTRAL EUROPEAN BANK "I love you, Egon. Let me stay with you!" "Of course, pet... if there is no other way..." "...you don't have to look after me at all, and I'll do everything for you to make you happy." "These days money is all one needs to be happy." "But don't you earn enough for the two of us to be able to live on it comfortably? What more do you want?" "Oh, silly girl! You don't understand these things." "Then explain it to me!" "Well, for instance, if tomorrow I had 100 dollars I could certainly earn 500 on the stock exchange with that. And the day after I could earn 1,000!" "If that makes you happy, I'll get you the 100 dollars." Trebitsch, the proprietor of the office. "Well, Miss Rumfort looks all worn out again today. Living it up last night again, were we?" "Here's a little advance to help you feel better." "I heard that one can make a lot of money when shares fall sharply..." "I want to invest my money as if the coal stocks are going to continue to fall." "It's not exactly safe, but if that's what you want..." "Today we'll let the Petrowitz shares fall sufficiently. But tomorrow..." "...a hundred percent rise in the market, for a start!" "You're going to Greifer' tonight? It's a delightful place, isn't it?" "The newspaper reported that the Petrowitz shares have fallen sharply again." "That means that we're rich! I speculated for a fall!" "That has to be celebrated. We've suffered long enough!" "But look at you! A counselor' daughter running about like that?" "Go over to Greifer' right now and buy yourself a new coat!" At the Carlton. Colonel James and Lieutenant Davy from a charity project of The American Red Cross. "Well, Lieutenant Davy, how do you like Vienna? It's a lovely city with lovely women, eh?" "Sure, James. But we're not here, after all, to look at this, we came to investigate the misery in Vienna!" "I'm not staying at the hotel. I'll move out tomorrow, and find myself some simple, cheap place to stay." "Where have you left your wife Lia?" "She was determined to see the first act of the opera at the court opera. She'll join us later..." "So when the lady arrives, let her in immediately." End of act 3 Act 4 Act 4 "But it's too expensive for us..." "Have I ever pressured anyone when they can't pay right away?" "A private matter, Miss Greifer..." "I'd like to ask Miss Greifer to loan me 100 dollars for my fianc?..." "Next door... there is a cosy little hotel." Midnight at the Merkl Hotel. "Wait for me in Miss Greifer' little salon." At the Carlton. "But anyway, the opera must be over by now." "I bet, Dr. Leid, your wife will show up in the next ten minutes." "Dear Doctor, something in fact appears to have happened..." "...something dreadful... ...she was strangled and robbed at a hotel in Melchior Alley..." "Done! Two hundred dollars worth of Petrowitz shares, payable tomorrow morning at today' rate." Investigation at the crime scene. "I couldn't see him clearly in the darkness. But I'm sure he had a goatee and a moustache..." "Would you recognize him again?" "Possibly..." "I think he went next door to Greifer' afterwards." "It has nothing to do with you, Miss Greifer. I just need to take a look around amongst your guests." "You were were next door in our hotel this evening... You forgot something..." "Arrest me? You must be joking! I have diplomatic immunity!" "Where can I make a phone call here?" "This way, Dr. Leid." "I'm sorry, Consul. You are at liberty to go." "Pardon me, the lady is my consular secretary." "Don't worry, pet. Come along. You'll be safe with me." "Arrest that man down there!" "We had to let him go just now." End of act 4 Act 5 Act 5 "I've been waiting here for an hour..." "I'm prepared to flee with you right away!" "Flee? Why do you want to flee?" "What you did is my fault, and I will bear the blame with you." "Good Lord, what are you talking about?" "You murdered and robbed Lia Leid to make a fortune on the stock exchange!" "Regina, what makes you think that, for heaven' sake?" "You don't love me, Egon. If you did, you wouldn't lie to me." "Well, you're not going to try to convince me today that you don't have a boyfriend." "I'm not staying one hour more!" "Get out of here this instant, you harlot! I won't have loose women in my office!" "So, tell me what you'd like to have." "Petrowitz shares have risen more than 100 percent! You'll have to cover it. I'm practically myself..." "That's much too expensive..." "Your coldness and indifference is unbearable! Have you really no wish?" "I'd like to go to Greifer' again tonight." "I've lost everything on the stock exchange and have debts on top of that." "But Daddy, we won't starve. You still have your job." "I don't have that anymore either, since yesterday." "Well, after all, I still have my job." "And then, we've been thinking about renting this room for a long time now." "Father lost everything on the stock exchange today." "So, you urgently need money?" "Could you loan me something? We have nothing at home." "I'm afraid I have nothing to spare at the moment either. But a rich uncle of mine is dropping in for coffee tomorrow." "I'll introduce you, if you'd like to come around for coffee." "I heard you're looking for a waiter." ROOM FOR RENT "Why aren't you laughing? I do everything you ask! You should laugh and be happy!" "I want to go to the same hotel room we were in yesterday." "You see, Rosenow, that's the kind of mistress to have. Such a noble, aristocratic creature!" "But what is it you want here?" "Nothing. I wanted to see the room again." "Marie, I don't know... You're like a secret..." "I really have one. I shall tell you..." "Last night, when you'd already left..." "...I saw the woman being murdered next door..." "I heard a scream next door." "And then I saw..." "I even know the man!" "Who is it?" "A certain Egon Stirner." End of act 5 Act 6 Act 6 The following afternoon, the first lodger arrived at the Rumforts. "How lucky I am to find a room with such a delightful landlady!" "The room is just grand! How much does it cost?" "30,000 crowns, if it's not too much for you..." "My dear Miss Rumfort, I get 60 dollars a month for accommodation. I don't want to profit from that, so you'll have to take more... "Then it's settled. May I move in this evening?" "Miss Rumfort, this is most embarrassing... Your father has run up certain debts with us." "This is all we have. Take it, but don't tell my father. He mustn't worry himself." In one of the secret salons of the procuress, Greifer. "He is already here..." "My niece, Leocadia." "Consul, here are the diplomatic passports." "The police demand we suspend your diplomatic rights so they can arrest you. We've given you the choice to leave on your own initiative." "Legation Councilor, my business is already done in Vienna. I will leave tomorrow." "But first I'd like to give your incompetent police a little hint regarding a certain murder case..." "Egon Stirner, the secretary of Rosenow, the banker." "Just let me know if you ever need anything. I have no problem getting food at the mission." "We don't need your charity, Lieutenant. We have everything we need." "I can't only eat cabbage my whole life!" "Can't you at least loan me a little?" "Please allow me to introduce myself. Pjotr Orlow, former cavalry captain to His Majesty the Czar..." "...now head waiter at Madame Greifer'." "As a nobleman let me tell you straight out: I like you." "You are one of the most enchanting women I have ever met. I give you my word of honor." "But only under one condition. I'm giving a little private party tonight. You must come as well." End of act 6 Act 7 Act 7 "You've packed?" "Once again, Regina is smarter than us all. She wants to go away until the scandal has died down." "But what happened?" BANK CLERK ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF MURDER. DURING THE PAST HOUR WE HAVE LEARNED THAT EGON STIRNER, A BANK CLERK, WAS ARRESTED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON ON STRONG SUSPICION OF MURDER IN THE MYSTERIOUS KILLING OF LIA LEID, AS HE MADE HIS PREPARATIONS TO ESCAPE. WE SHALL REPORT FURTHER DETAILS TOMORROW. THE INTERROGATION OF EGON STIRNER, HELD ON OCTOBER 29, 1921. I PLEAD NOT GUILTY. I ADMIT I HAD A RENDEZVOUS WITH MRS. LEID IN THE ROOM WHERE SHE WAS MURDERED. I TOLD HER OF A GREAT STOCK EXCHANGE COUP, WHICH SHOULD MAKE ME RICH WITHIN DAYS AND COMPLAINED THAT I LACKED THE NECESSARY CAPITAL. SHE HERSELF SUGGESTED SHE LEND ME HER JEWELRY FOR PAWNING. I LEFT THE ROOM ONE HOUR LATER AT HER REQUEST, AS SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE SEEN WITH ME. SHE WAS PERFECTLY WELL AND IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS. "And why were you in need of a fake beard that evening?" "It was a romantic whim of the poor murdered woman." The "little private party." "...and that is why I had no choice but to come to this terrible place." "You must see that I can't grant you what you ask of me." "Well, we've all had little love affairs like that in our time." "I ordered a little girlfriend and that's what you delivered me!" "What are you running here, Greifer? I have enough emotional problems to deal with at home!" "This cannot continue! Come when I display tableaux vivants. That will make good use of you..." "Are you angry with me?" "We are like brother and sister, both destined to suffer and be despised." "I'll fetch the glazier right away." "And then I saw Marianne come in and take two tins from the cupboard." "You're lying!" "A Rumfort does not steal!" "I must ask you to vacate your room at once!" "Well lad, you'll have to pack your bags again, I suppose." "Lad, you don't know the world, especially not women, and you don't know what dire need has made of many of these poor Viennese girls." "Tonight I'll show you another side of Vienna. One that's sure to take your mind off things!" "First of all we must apologize to the Lieutenant and ask him to stay!" "They've left already. What shall we do now, Father?" "He must eat properly." End of act 7 Act 8 Act 8 "We're doing better now. The innkeeper allowed us to move into his attic." "Why do you keep staring up there every night?" "You should really return to your parents. You're very ill." "Father, don't beat me!" "Wait, I will make you a nice hot soup. That will do you good." "Mother, bring a newspaper back with you." "Will you lend me an egg and some firewood, neighbor?" INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE LEID MURDER HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. THE EVIDENCE AGAINST EGON STIRNER LEAVES HIS GUILT IN NO DOUBT, DESPITE HIS DENIALS. THE TRIAL WILL BEGIN NEXT... I HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME AND MUST ATONE FOR IT. I WANTED TO SEE YOU ONE LAST TIME. FORGIVE ME THE SORROW I HAVE CAUSED YOU. MARIE. "I love you. Now I believe in your innocence." "You did not become as rich as I am, but now I am as poor as you. I have left my parents. My father has disowned me." "Repeat your confession in the presence of the accused." "I confess again that I murdered Lia Leid out of jealousy." "I always loved only you." End of act 8 Act 9 Act 9 GRETE RUMFORT. RECEIPT FOR $60 IN SETTLEMENT OF THE COST OF COAL STOCKS BOUGHT BY COUNCILOR RUMFORT. "Where is Grete?" "I think Grete is at Miss Greifer' across the way." "So, this is your costume." "Do you hear what's going on over there at Greifer'?" "Be-gin!" "Just you wait until WE begin!" "Take pity on me! I love you so..." "How did you come to be here?" "Probably for the same reason as most of the other girls here: Because we and our families would otherwise starve!" "Starve! How can you tell such lies? I gave you 60 dollars for the rent!" "Listen, she is innocent!" "Get out of my way! I've seen enough!" "I was sent to this city to ease its hunger and misery, but all I see is glitter, luxury and immorality!" "You cannot open any door here without coming face to face with naked misery!" "I alone am responsible." GRETE RUMFORT. RECEIPT FOR $60 IN SETTLEMENT OF... "The baby is hungry." "I can't nurse anymore." "I'm too weak." "I'm going to try again at the butchers..." "Please, please, just a little! My child is starving..." "Yes, I have enough meat..." "...but I won't give you any!" "The girl killed him! With the butcher' cleaver!" "Miss Grete, I was very unfair to you." "Now you know everything, and when you think back on me, you won't think badly of me." "No, Miss Grete, our story should not end this way. "The attic is on fire!" "Save the baby!" "You belong to us, to all of Melchior Alley!" The End
