NO FUEL LEFT Hello, G.O.? It's Riva. I just arrived. Let's go. People always turn up at mealtime. Jesus Christ! Riva! Is that you? Look who came back. - Riva... Don't stay outside. Did you take a cattle truck? Let our guest rest a bit, would you? J.M. So you married her and all... We should go out. - Where? I've no idea. There's tons of girls waiting for us. I've given up all that. After all this time. You owe me this, J.M. I have to run an errand. - And you need those shoes for it? You heard that? It's already started. One drink and I'll come home. Got any cash? - Real cash. How real? Bingo! Come on. Let's go. Riva is in town. His truck arrived to Mariano. G.O. - Riva! How're you doing? What did I tell you? Here I am in Kinshasa! The merchandise is here. This is J.M., my mate. Let's go to the office. That's worth a visit to Mother Edo. All that merchandise... This gas, it is yours? - What do you think? G.O. was my associate in Angola. We pulled it off there. I'm coming. The city is out of gas. And it's gonna get worse. Then we'll give the stuff. 5, 6... 10 dollars a litre. A little advance. For the weekend. Have you got any more cigars? Put them in here. Who's that? - I told you, he's a brother. You're in Kinshasa. Know what I mean? Don't worry. I'll call you. Tissues? 200 francs! Did we ask you for anything? Get lost. Ya Boss. I've got cellphones. They're cheap. $20. They're cheap. $20. - Where did you get all that from? I can't tell you that. It'd be betraying Anto's ideology. To get the cash, you need the stuff. But if I tell you where the stuff is, you'd get it yourself. How will Anto make money? - You're Anto? Here, you look hungry. The electricity! It's becoming unbearable. What's that? Did you like it? You think that a guy like you can look at me? I've had guys beaten up for less than that. You're not from here! - Do you think I'm a whore? You see there? My man is around there. And his guards. I snap my fingers... and you disappear. I just had village women for 10 years. Horrible, with sagging tits. Where are you from? - Get lost. Before I lose it. Sit down. I wanna dance. - You're drunk. Put her in the car. - The first one who touches me... Hey, boss. Don't do that. - Why not? It's Azor. A bandit! Can you find me her address? - Buy a phone, I'll tell you tomorrow. I can't believe it! Is that you? My God! I didn't think you'd have survived. - Me neither. My Riva! You're so handsome. You have the eyes of a man. But you're still my baby! Mother Edo. I need some firmer tits. Is that for me? My Riva! I'm going to find them for you. The firmest tits! Are you happy? I'm going back there. Help yourself if you're thirsty. That woman! Her red hair! Who? - With a woman like that, you keep her at home and it'll be all over! She'll spend her time eating and watching religious TV shows. She'll get fat. She'll refuse to fuck, and piss you off! Madam the Commander. It's been ages! - We better go to my office. I'm looking for a guy who's just arrived. Riva. So? - He turned up in Mariano. I want you to help us find him. I can tell you that Mariano is a truck station. And even give the address. But I already have a job. The guy is easy. He likes going out, the big life. We have business with him. And some for you, too. Maybe I haven't made myself clear. My sister, help me. Do what Cesar asks. I'll explain later. I'm alright. But do what he asks. Your sister who loves you, Rosie. Mother Edo is the coolest in the Congo! Sure she is. It's Anto. - How you doing? Do you remember the red-haired woman? I know where she'll be tonight. Tonight? - Meet me in Pompage. Bring some money. Give that to me. How much is there? - 10,000 francs. ($25) What can I do with that? Hello, 10-25! - Look at this! Always need to skim something off those morons. I see you're onto a big deal. What a country of niggers. There, the last arrived from Angola. They're all from Angola. Driver? - Paul. Take care of the kid. Paul? - I'm only leaving in three hours. I always get paid in advance. - Where's Riva? Where is the gas? - I don't know. They took me to a place I don't know. I'm not from Kinshasa. You're not from Kinshasa but you know Riva. God! What's wrong with you? What do we do now? - Nothing. And fuck all of you! Crazies! But we have to find Riva. - What the hell do I know about Riva? What do I know about Riva? Let go of me! You wanna talk about Rosie? Madame Nora, there's no gas. Move that car. No gas, Madam. What's this, then? Give me the keys of the car. I'm going shopping. - There's no fuel. Don't fuck around with me. There's fuel in the garage. Give me ten litres. Fuel is scarce. Stop running around. Don't go shopping so much. I'm sick of being cooped up. - You're always sick of something. We're gonna see a friend. Can't find a better snooper. But you gotta pay the price. Get out! You can't do that to me. You are one cocky bitch. You owe me money, then you vanish... And I'm sure you came for a favor. You know how it goes. I've got something good for you. Who's this? He's the client. He's looking for Riva. He says the guy likes parties, women... As does everybody. - He's got a lot of money, Malou. What do you mean? Could I go to Europe? She wants money. Commander? Wait for me outside. Malou! - Shut up. But the others are waiting. - Shut up. I've been waiting, too. You think I will let you leave just like that? Shut up. We'll wait outside. Hello. Are these your men? Is that car yours? Identity papers. Thank you. You are Angolan. Angolans? A lot of weapons have been circulating lately. I'm a merchant. I have no weapons. Why do you arrest us? - You haven't been arrested. We're doing routine checks. These Congolese niggers, I'll blow them all away. And that Commander bitch, she ran away. The captain is not here? - He just left. He went that way. Impossible. That idiot is too emotional. - Bitch! She couldn't let her sister down just like that. I've sent a note to immigration for checking. What kind of procedure is that? Has anyone told you how our compatriots are treated in their country? I understand. When can we get an answer? Tomorrow morning. - You're lying. As the military officer in charge, I demand their immediate release. Where do you think you are? On a battlefield? People are in charge here, as well. - Captain? I think that between us Congolese, we can find a way. I left for Angola ten years ago. I wanted to come home and say... "Mum, here's $1,000 for you". It's gonna be hot tonight! Ya boss, I'm here! - Kid, you are late. Great clothes! - So classy. So? You remember the red-haired lady? She'll be at the Sai Sai tonight. Her name is Nora. Do you know the Sai Sai? Let's go. I deserve a commission. - See this money? Use it well. See that telephone booth over there? I want to open one. Get us out of this hole. The captain wants $1,000. - What? They have already taken $1,000, these monkeys. Shut up. You might spend the night. - Okay. But first they give us back all our stuff. Waiter, champagne! How much is it? - $150. You, move. - What's this? You can't come in today. Move! The big boss, the descendant of all the Kings of Congo... the strong man of Kinshasa. Azor the First is among us. It's her. Azor's woman! You recognize me? My name is Riva. This day without you was terrible. Still looking for a fight? Tell me, brother. How many crates of champagne have I drunk in your place? Times are hard, so you can disrespect me. It's not that! - No... Your men come here. They're always fighting. Kinshasa's expensive. How much do I owe you? I have the money nearby. I'll be right back. You'd better not be found here. A nice chick like you should be with a real man. A man with lots of money. Who gives you love. If you carry on like this, they will cut you up in little pieces. After, I would enjoy hearing all your stories. Get lost. Is your name on this seat? No, but this is my woman. Get lost before I get angry. So what? - Careful! Come on, show me! - I'm not your pal. Be careful, moron! With all due respect, I'd like to introduce a brother of mine, Riva. This is Azor, one of the great men of Kinshasa. Come back and you'll see! Peasant! You better behave yourself when I leave you alone. Shit, I haven't done anything. You hurt me. My earring! This is worth double what I owe you. Tomorrow I'll bring you the cash. We'd better go hunting elsewhere. I smell big trouble with that Nora. We'll be in deep shit. Why are you so afraid? She's mine. She doesn't know it yet. I think Riva is that guy over there. Three foreigners beat up a driver in Mariano. He died from his wounds. - How does that concern us? We'll soon find out. There's an eyewitness. I've sent one of my men to pick him up. "Riva is at the Sai Sai" How much does an arrangement bring in? - What are you implying? Nothing. It's a free country. The judge is gonna make a bundle. 10,000 dollars. My earring! Shut your face or you'll get one. That earring is from my family. You can't just steal it. I don't like this act with your friend. Understand? It's not what you think, boss. Riva did good business selling gas. That's the reason why he's a bit excited. He's a good guy. Wait. Leave the descendant of all the kings of Congo. The king of morons! A woman like you deserves to be with me. You're going to take me into a dark corner? Lift up my skirt? Then I'll set you on fire. You really think so? How much do you weigh? You're too small for me. He's got a lot of fuel. You want to talk? I can make it happen. That asshole over there... He just grabbed me. - Get off me, I'm talking business. Are you a man or what? Listen, boss... - Fuck off! Take care of him. Which one? - The one at the bar. The one with a scarf on his head? We gotta move! - What now? Things will be getting heated. Azor is sending one of his men over. He has no balls. if he were a man, he'd have come himself. The round's on me! The round's on me! I'm paying! Are you sure this is hers? - Yes, Azor is... Show me. - He's a boss, so it's good quality. I need money. I will pay you, don't worry. $10,000? Better pay and vanish, while you can. If the judge sees you, the price will go up. I got a message from Malou. She found Riva. The money is in my bag in the car. We're not gonna spend the night. Wait. We're off. What's the use of your big muscles? Jerk. You won't have Nora like that. What do you know? I know things. This is what I'm paid for. Are you interested? Nora lost something important. I can help you find it. How much do you pay me? Is that it? - I want to see what I'm paying for. I want more. Madame Nora, we'll get your earring back. He pawns it. As soon as there's money, we'll get it back. Son of a bitch. How could you sell my earring? Shut your face. We'll get it back. - If I had known... I should have let that guy fuck me. At least I'd have had something between my legs. Get out. I told you to get out. You're pathetic. - Out! You sit on your ass all day long watching porn. Then... You go to the bathroom... You jerk off... And cum on the floor. - Get out of here. I told you to get out of here! Get out of my house. I told you to get out of my house! - Come here! Come here! Help me climb up the wall. Are you crazy? There might be dogs. - Help me climb up. Come here! Are you fucking with me? You think you can hold me? Move over! Move over! - What are you gonna do to me? Son of a bitch! What are you gonna do to me? What the hell are you doing here? Get lost! I will call the guards. Please do. - I'm going. Go. So? You have a cigarette? - I have better. Close your eyes. Look. You're my diamond. You're a child. No more than you are. No more than you are. A real kiss. What the hell is he doing here? Get him! Get him! Come here. Come on, J.M! Look how beautiful she is. She's all yours. I need to go to the Sai Sai Club. A chick is waiting for me. Everything all right? Speaking of that... Can I have some hot water? Really hot water... And something really good to eat. No problem. No problem. - You're sure? All under control. Follow me. Hello, J.M. ? Where are you? - I'm with Riva. The kid is sick, we have to go to the hospital. Now? - Yes, now. Hurry up, we're waiting. Man, I'm turned on. I need to shoot my load. I can help you if you want. Better than nothing. You make it fast. You're gonna kill me! You're gonna give me more money. - Shut up. This country... This earring comes from Nubia. Do you know what Nubia is? - No. You've never opened a history book, have you? You know, as for us, we're looking for money. History... My father... He's a history teacher. One day... I disgraced him. I studied in his school. Every Wednesday afternoon... the director... invited me into his office. And I took off. - Sugar Daddy... He gave you money. He took care of you. So? How did your father find out? One day... when we were done, I left the office. My father was there. Sitting. Waiting. Please don't. Don't show me that money. I can't believe this. A woman like you staying with Azor only for love. It wasn't for the money. In this country you think money is everything. You know, Riva... money is like poison. At the very end... it always kills you. It always kills you. A police captain and four cops were savagely murdered by a group of Angolan thugs. With the complicity of a Congolese army Commander. Let's hear from our correspondent on the scene. The carnage took place here around 11:30 p.m. Shocked witnesses claim they recognized Camp Lwano Commander. She's suspected of being the instigator. Fofo Kajé, Congo TV, from Kinshasa. I'm wanted by the police. - It's your fault. You're not effective enough. - Who do you think you are? I'm not effective? Figure it out by yourselves then. When you start something, you have to finish it. Or face the consequences. She's cute, your sister Rosie. I could carve out her vagina... remove her ovaries and give them to my dogs. She's fine, for now... It's not a hotel here. You can't just turn up at any time. We apologize, Father Gaston. It was a case of force majeure. Please let me introduce Mr. Cesar. They'll stay a few nights. - All right, but the rates have changed. You pay $500 per head, in advance. After that, we'll see. God's house! - It's the rate for outlaws. Jesus Christ was an outlaw. I've watched the news. I swear to God I have no blood on my hands. They have my sister. You can't wear this uniform. Come. - Thank you. A certain Riva. Stole a big shipment of fuel. And he's here? - Are you interested? Priests need gas too. Alas! Do you want to be in on it? So, asshole. Did you sleep well? I'm gonna give you some advice. Give me half of your fuel and I'll forget everything. Do you understand? Who told you about the fuel? I've got none for you anyway. That's good money. But you gotta make an effort. Listen. Give me all your gas. Or I throw you to the crocodiles. Simple. Throw him to the crocodiles. You, go get the police. Hurry. My cousin is in the police. I'm calling him right now. Do you remember last night at the club? Wait! Wait!... I'll give you five drums of gas. Five drums of gas. Five each. OK, ten drums. Ten drums. OK? Since when do you cry? What? - I've never seen you cry. I'm exhausted. I haven't slept. Did he fuck you all night long? - Don't talk like that, please. I conned him. Right. But you took your time. You're hurting yourself. We've got the money. Forget about the rest. You liked it. It wasn't enough! How much for blowing him? - I'm not a whore! Slut... I'm not a whore! Do you understand? Let go of me! You'll be done for, if I catch you! Dumb bitch! Life is good in Kinshasa! Is this enough for two drinks? - It's on me. What happened? Nothing special. Where are we gonna wind up tonight? We could start at Mother Edo. Do you want to join us? - It's in Ozone, near the old sawmill. Ask for Mother Edo, you'll find your way. There'll be real girls there. No, I don't do that kind of stuff. Meet us there. J.M., let's go. I'll still keep your room. What happened to you? - Nothing. Trifles. Where's Nora? I don't know. We gotta go to G.O.'s. I'm out of cash. All the dough's gone? You're sexy. - So? So what? He was there, you missed him. What have you got? We have less and less chance to find our merchandise back. Last night, Riva was after Azor's girl, Nora. She may know something. I know where they live. You know him? - Yes, he's a bandit. He's got a place in the hills. In Kinshasa... Muhammad Ali knocks out George Foreman in the 8th round. Where's Riva? Were you with him last night? All right. I'm gonna hurt you. And I promise you'll feel like talking. Well... Where's our friend Riva? And the fuel? Who's got it? You'll be next up for the crocodiles. You are Nora. Where's Riva? Baby, if you don't talk to me, I'll have to give you to them. They'll make you talk. - Sister, please, let me go. I'm over with Azor. I came to get my passport. Where's Riva? Where's Riva? So? What are you doing? You're scratching your snatch against the table? Have you been traumatized by your mother? Or are you a self-hating fag? - You want me to show you? What about showing it to me? I like men. Real men. Take me. Whores, they are like trash. Whores' lovers are worse. - So your mum was a whore. Is that it? One day, we'll have a talk, Commander. - Looking forward to it... Commander? Let her go. I'm going to tail her. I'm sure we'll find Riva this way. Sister. - I'm not a nun. I'm called Commander. I'm in the services. Angolans are looking for Riva because he stole gas from them. Azor is finished. Don't come back. If you see Riva... Come on, go. Why don't you sell now? The price keeps going up. Tomorrow, it'll explode. Then I'll sell it all. If you don't screw up, you'll have a lot more tomorrow. He told me he went out to Ozone. Near the old sawmill. At Mother Edo's. Okay. - Thank you. Don't move. Death is a game for you. That girl! Her red hair! I think I love her. Are you sure? - I think so. You're smashing yourself to smithereens for women. Ya boss, it's Anto! Someone stole the money you gave me. Do you know the sawmill? If you are in the neighborhood, ask for Mother Edo's place. I'll be there. Can you lend me some cash? Things are getting rough at home. I have none to spare now. G.O. gave you some. How are we gonna drink in here? Don't worry, tomorrow we'll become the kings of the city. Are you kidding me? Watch out! Wait for me over there. Is Riva here? I must talk to him. Riva is busy. You can't see him today. I saw some Angolan men. They're looking for him. He stole some fuel from them. Is that the only reason you want to see him? Shoot him. Enough. He knows nothing. Riva's gone with his girl, Nora. You're waking up! How do you know that? Nora came. She told me. Retention of information! You're gonna kill him. As a punishment. Malou's gonna find Riva soon. Then we can get him. There are things that you say, and things that you don't say. Where is the truth? Please, don't... Hello? It's Malou. Riva is at Mother Edo's. Commander knows where it is. Forgive me. You understand now... Go and tell him... Tell your father that... what you miss the most is the childhood you spent by his side. Come with me. There are some paths we can only walk down alone. You didn't come yesterday. - It's a miracle. What are you doing here? I've come for you. How did you get here? - We'll talk about that later. J.M., Riva's friend. - Where is the gas? Who are you? - Commander. Riva doesn't have much time left. A deal has to be made for the gas. Are you in? Where is Riva? Is there another way in? Don't move. Wait! Don't go! Riva! Run! Finally I find you! Where is my gas? It's not your gas. I went out and got it while you were sitting on your fat ass. Don't forget who you're talking to. Fuck you. - After all that I've done for you. You were nothing when you arrived. I made you. - Stop it! All you wanted was money! You used me like a slave, bastard! - Where's the gas? Fucking parasite! - I fucked you. I hope it hurts. Where's my gas? - I don't have it. Where's my gas? - Wait! Where's the gas? Where's the gas? The gas! What happened? - The Angolans are dead. And Riva? - He was among them. I had to shoot. I had no choice. You're coming with us. Come on. You've seen the shipment, how much is there? A whole truck. How many litres is it? - A big truck, maybe... 25,000 litres. $6 or $7 a litre. - That makes a lot! I know a Lebanese man. He has a network in the country. He'll pay more. - No. We sell to the priest. OK. I want to be in on it. Let's pick up the money and take off. I know where the fuel is. I have the gas. Do you really have the gas? How much? - A whole truck. You have the money? For how much? - Rate of the day. And a little something to help the family. $7 a litre. I'll pass by in the morning. - It's a lot of money. I have to see the bishop. - You can still sell it later. Ya Boss, are you dead? Fuck, we've been shot! Who shot us? No gas. No Riva. We have nothing. We have to be more ruthless. I hope God will have mercy on him. Where are you going? You can't leave! You can't leave. - Let me go. Leaving to be with those whores! Whores! You can't leave. You're ugly. You idiot. You don't know how to fuck. - You're gonna kill me! Your children are morons. You piss me off, OK? You think you're gonna leave the children like this? You're gonna kill me! I'll make money on a big deal that's going down. Then I'll spend it all by myself! Alone! What do you want? Get lost! Get lost! I curse you. Your big deal, with J.M. Well, I hope that money will kill you. Daddy, I have no big deal going on with J.M. Yes, you do. He said he's gonna make a lot of money. That he'd fuck beautiful women. Is that what you brought us? We were a family! Do you know what it means? Are you at the warehouse? - No, I'm at the yard. The Angolans know I'm here. Where are you? At my parents'. - All right. See you there. We thought we had no more children. I didn't have time to buy a gift. What are you doing? - He's my friend. Good morning, madam. Good morning, sir. Do you want some water? After such a long silence, you show up just like that. I had an accident. He helped me. - A blade! Did you ever think of the pain you're causing us? Why would he think about that? Drink and fornicate. A whole life's ambition. He's no-good. - Are you better than me? When I was your age, I was feeding my whole family. Stop it, I know that story. - Look. Do you know how much it costs to raise a child in this country? After the lootings, the war... Thank you. You can leave with that. Ya boss. We better leave. Give him that glass. Who do you think you are? You take off like a thief, come back and now want to rule the roost? I'm ruling the roost? - Yes, you are! Offering water is ruling the roost? - Yes, it is! A freak of nature. Yes, it is. After the good son died, all that's left is the scar. Where were you? Where were you? At 6 p.m. mass? I was praying. - Pray! Pray! Where were you when I got this one? A father cares. That's no way to talk. You'll never pay enough for the pain you caused. Criminal! You killed your brother! Do you have the money? - What are you? Waking me up in the middle of the night. Looking for so much money. Are you a gangster or what? - It's a good deal. Next week, you can resell it for 15. - Well, well... Making plans, I see! Maybe it is the Devil who's come to forgive all your sins. Now we have to end this story. You two, what are you good for? - I know where the fuel is. And I know how to get there. - OK. You? You are useless. I just want to buy the fuel. These are the savings of the whole congregation. You are a priest. In what kind of business do you bring the money before seeing the goods? Don't pretend to cry at the cross now. Kinshasa the beauty, Kinshasa the garbage. This is the warehouse. Your country is the worst cow pie I've ever seen. Maybe you should have remained colonized. What's going on with J.M.? I don't know. It seems like he's onto a big deal. I think you'd better go. I have nothing left. That's OK, ya boss. I'll wait for you. Here, it's all I have. You can buy a Coke and some bread. My buddy Anto! Ya boss, can I wait for you? - Not here. Something's weird here. Move, you bastard! Come on, move. You did this to me? - I thought you were dead! Oh yes, did you check? - How could I have checked? Go away, Judas. You fulfilled your function. Bricks are fired as in the Middle Ages in your country. Would you like to end up here? First the smoke will attack your lungs. The heat will burn your skin, your hair. Go fuck yourself. And you, sister, why are you here? - I'm not a nun. I'm in the military. I have a sister in Angola who sent me these guys. Are you Rosie's sister? - Do you know her? It was her birthday, last year, just before she died. Don't say that! It's not possible, I received a letter from her not long ago. It was a fake. Is Rosie dead? You can say it now, you bastard! - Without lube. You can take it out on women. Can you act like a man? With your hands? - Shut up! Jorge... Shooting people in the back. Taking it out on defenseless women. Will you shut your mouth? - Your mother was a whore, who got laid by everybody. Come on, hit me! Stop talking about my mother, you bitch! You bitch! You're gonna cry like a baby. It's gonna be great. Thank you, Cesar. Thanks for everything. You don't know what you're missing. Life is still good!
