Manu-ri, Tanhyeon-myeon in Paju City. It's me, Shin Hae-mi! I had plastic surgery. I got pretty, right? Are you free? It's my break soon. Did you serve in the military? Of course. And then? And then what? I graduated from college and I have a part time job now. But I'm doing something else on the side. Like what? If I may ask... I'm writing You're writing? What are you writing? A novel. Wow. Then are you a writer? Not officially. I'm trying to become one. How cool. Writer Lee Jong-su. - How's work? - Okay. It's fun. I like this kind of work. Physical work. I only come to work when they call me so it gives me a lot of freedom. So that's cool. Now you seem like the Hae-mi I used to know. Do you want this? From the raffle. I've never worn a watch before. Damn. It's so tacky. Hey, do you want to grab a drink with me tonight? Why not? Guess what? I'm going to Africa. Africa? Why? I've been saving up to travel. But why Africa? This is pantomime. I'm learning pantomime these days. Why? Do you want to become an actress? You think anyone can become an actress? I'm just learning it for fun. Look. I can eat tangerines whenever I want. That's good. You're talented. This has nothing to do with talent. This is how it works. Don't think there is a tangerine here. Just forget that there isn't one. That's the key. The important thing is to think you really want one. Then your mouth will water, and it'll really taste good. Do you know the Bushmen who live in the Kalahari Desert? They have two types of "starving people." Starving people. "Hunger" in English. "Little Hunger" and "Great Hunger." Little Hunger is a person who is literally hungry. Great Hunger is a person who is hungry for the meaning of life. Someone wishing to know why we live, what meaning there is in life, that sort of thing. They are the truly hungry people. So they are called "Great Hunger." So you're going to Africa to meet "Great Hunger"? Cool, right? Great Hunger... Jong-su. Lee Jong-su. Will you do me a favor? I have a pet cat. Can you feed it while I'm in Africa? Do I have to bring the cat to my place? No. You have to come to my place because a cat shouldn't be removed from its house. What's with all the luggage? I'm moving into my house in Paju. - Today? - Yes. Who lives in your Paju house? No one. My mom left when I was little and my sister got married a few years ago. So only my dad lives there raising the cows, but he ran into a problem, so now I have to return home. You're not asking what the problem was? There are always problems. We're here. Hello. Nice place. The toilet was next to the kitchen sink in my old room. This room faces North, so it's always chilly and dark. It gets sunlight only once a day. From over there. The sunlight hits the Seoul Tower window and bounces into my room. It's only for a brief moment. You have to be lucky to see it. Boil. Come on out. Boil. Your cat's name is Boil? Yes, Boil. I found him abandoned in the basement boiler room. He hides and doesn't come out if there's a stranger here. He has severe autism. Boil doesn't exist only in your imagination too, does he? Am I coming here to feed an imaginary cat? You think I asked you to come here to feed an imaginary cat? That's funny. Should I forget that there isn't a cat? Do you remember? You said that I am ugly. Really? I said that? One day, on my way home from school, you crossed the street and told me that. "You are really ugly." It was the only thing you ever said to me in junior high. Now tell me the truth. Why can't you say anything? Wait. Put it on. What, punk? Moo... Hello? Hello? Hello? Recent figures prove the severity of our country's youth unemployment. It is growing at the fastest rate among OECD member countries. Reporter Park Seong-ho will explain. The growth of our unemployment rate is the fastest within the OECD. He claims that he set a new vision for America. A poll by the Washington Post and ABC found that 94% of Trump voters... Hello? He was awarded high marks for fulfilling his campaign promises, such as immigrant deportation, the Mexico border wall, and abolishing Obamacare. Boil, where are you? Boil? Come out, come out, wherever you are. Look what we've got here? What's this, Mr. Boil? If you wanted to hide, you should've hidden your poop too. You're introducing your poop to me first? Before a "Nice to meet you"? You will not be disadvantaged for refusing to testify. However, if you forfeit your right not to testify and do testify, your testimony may be used against you to prove your guilt. Do you understand? Yes. Now. Would the prosecution please state the arraignment? The defendant, a livestock worker, assaulted and injured a civil servant of Paju City, obstructing the legitimate execution of duty, and fracturing the government official's right hand, requiring six weeks of treatment. Fine. Did you receive the indictment including what you've just heard? Yes. Then do you accept the charges? And do you have anything else to say? The defendant accepts all charges, Your Honor. Okay. Mr. Lee. Do you agree with your attorney's statement? Mr. Lee? Did you graduate from college? Yes. But you still don't have a job? What was your major? - I studied creative writing, sir. - Creative writing. So you studied writing. What kind of writing are you going to create? I'm planning to write a novel. Novel? Wow... So, what kind of novel do you want to write? I'm not sure yet... How about writing about your father? In my opinion, he's like a protagonist in a story. Look at his life! It's so turbulent! He was nuts back in the day. Aren't all protagonists nuts? He was number one in Paju High. Not for his grades, but for his pride. After he returned from working in the Middle East, I told him to buy an apartment building in Gangnam with the money he earned. I promised he wouldn't regret it. But he didn't, because of his pride. Instead, he returned to Paju and became a livestock farmer, and now he's broke and in jail. Even now. He should apologize to the victim and write a letter of apology. He should submit a petition to the judge for a reprieve. But he's being stubborn. He doesn't even listen to his lawyer. That's why I wanted to see you. Visit your father and talk to him. Tell him to tame his temper and write that letter of apology. Immediately. Like tomorrow. Got it? Hey, I'm back. You're still not showing yourself? It's been over two weeks. Hello? Hello? Hello? I got through. Hello? It's me, Hae-mi! It was really hard making this call. We might get disconnected. I'm at Nairobi Airport in Kenya. There was a bombing near the airport. I was stuck here for three days. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. I think it happens often here. Anyway, I finally got a flight out of here. I arrive at 4 p.m. tomorrow. Will you come to the airport? I'll be there. For sure. Hello? Jong-su! You're here. Give me that. Ben! This is my one and only friend, Lee Jong-su. Hi. I'm Ben. We're Nairobi comrades. We were stuck at Nairobi Airport together for three anxious days. We were the only two Koreans there. I'm hungry. I slept through the flight and didn't eat anything. I want some Korean food. Like tripe stew. Does it have to be tripe stew? I've been craving it for some reason. I know the best tripe restaurant in Seoul. Really? Jong-su, let's go eat tripe stew. Yeah, I'm on my way. I'm in my friend's car. He came to pick me up. What? Yes, I'm fine. You know health has never been an issue, thanks to my superior DNA. What? Come on... Wow... How can you be so naive? You're old enough to know better. You should keep a record of that. Because that is an epic event in the life of Ms. Kim. Yes... I miss you too. Okay. I'll stop by sometime this week. Yes. Okay, Mom. I joined the Sunset Tour on my way to the Kalahari Desert. It's a program that shows you the sunset of the desert. But it turned out to be a parking lot. There was nothing but trash tourists left behind. Everybody came with someone, but I was the only one by myself. I really felt all alone there. I wondered why I was even there, all alone. Then the sun started to set. The sun was setting beyond the endless sand-covered horizon. At first it was orange. Then it turned blood red. Then purple, then navy. It got darker and darker as the sunset disappeared, and my eyes suddenly welled up with tears. "I must be at the end of the world." That's what I thought. "I want to vanish just like that sunset." Dying is too scary, but... I wished I could disappear as if I had never existed. It's fascinating to see people cry. Fascinating? Why? Because I've never shed a single tear in my life. I suppose I did when I was really little, but I can't remember ever shedding a tear. That is fascinating. But you do feel sadness, don't you? Maybe. I'm not sure. But since I've never shed a single tear, I'm not sure if it was real sadness that I felt. May I ask what you do for a living? Well, I do this and that. You wouldn't understand even if I told you, but to put it simply, I play. You play? Yes. Nowadays, there is no distinction between working and playing. May I ask who your favorite writer is? William Faulkner. Oh, Faulkner. When I read his work, I feel like I'm reading about myself. Since you write fiction, I'd like to have a chat with you sometime. I want to tell you my story. Isn't she cute? She falls asleep anywhere when she's sleepy. It doesn't even take ten seconds. - Hey, you're here! - Yes. - I parked the car out front. - Thank you. Excuse me for a second. Did you step on it? No. I just quietly followed you from the airport. That's harder. Speeding up and slowing down... - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hae-mi... Hae-mi! Wake up. It's time to go home. Want me to take you home? Go ahead. I have a long way to go, anyway. Jong-su, it was nice meeting you. Likewise. Say something. If you called you should say something. Why did you call if you are not going to talk? DEAR HONORABLE JUDGE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK. WE WRITE TO REQUEST YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION FOR THE DEFENDANT LEE YONG-SEOK WHO IS BEING TRIED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, ASSAULT, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. LEE YONG-SEOK WAS AN HONEST FARMER AND OUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR. Hello? Excuse me! Nobody's home. What is it? What is it about? Is your husband home? He isn't here. What is it? I'm here to get signatures for a petition. He isn't here. - I'll come back again. - Okay. Actually, I don't know your father that well. He didn't really interact with us. Whatever he did, he always did alone. Sir, this is just a petition. It won't cause you trouble in any way. No, it's just this part. "Lee Yong-seok was an honest farmer and our friendly neighbor." Frankly, he was never friendly. Sorry about that. You write very well. We still have a calf left at our house. Do you know anyone who'd want to buy it? - A calf? - Yes. Boy or girl? It's female. I'll have to ask around. Hello? Is someone else here? Good to see you again, Jong-su. Hae-mi wanted to see you. No, Ben kept asking me to call you. Did you have trouble finding this place? No. I used my phone. Ben says he lives near here. It's nice. It's quiet. Keep going. Ben was reading my palm. Hae-mi, you have something different from other people. What's that? There's something in your heart. A stone. The stone is making you suffer. That's why you can't fully enjoy things. That's why you can't appreciate tasty food, or tell a guy you like that you like him. Then what should I do? You need to remove the stone. Want me to do it? You can do that? Just trust me. Hold my hand... And close your eyes. Now open your hand. What's this? What do you think? It's a stone. I took it out of your heart. Where did you get this? Back there from the flower bed. - To do this? - Yes. - You brought one back to do this? - Yes. What for? For fun. I'll do anything for fun. Jong-su. Do you like pasta? What? He said he'll cook us pasta at his place. - Hello. - How was your trip back home? Great, thanks to you. Ben, you're really good. I envy people who cook well. Jong-su. Can you cook too? I guess, since I live alone. But I can only make a few dishes. I like to cook because I can make what I want, any way I want. What's better is that I get to eat it. Just as humans make offerings to the gods, I make my own offering and consume it. Offering? An offering. It's a metaphor. What's a metaphor? A metaphor is... Well, ask Jong-su. - Hae-mi. - Yes? Do you know where the bathroom is? Ben, where's the bathroom? Down the hall. How much older is he than me? Six or seven years? How does he live like that at his age? Traveling abroad, driving a Porsche, listening to music while cooking pasta... I guess he's young and rich. He's the Great Gatsby. What do you mean? Mysterious people who are young and rich but you don't know what they really do. There are so many Gatsbys in Korea. Why do you think he's seeing you? Have you ever think about that? He said he likes people like me. He thinks I'm interesting. - Hi. - Hey guys! Hello. This is my new friend, Lee Jong-su. He writes. You're a writer? I'm not published yet. I'm just writing at the moment. If you write, you're a writer. A "writer." Someone who writes. Ben, it was just a question. I'm going inside. Me too. Provence. You're right. I remember that well. The bushmen light a bonfire at night and dance around it. They've been doing this since a long time ago. The oldest and wisest woman plays the drums. Then everybody dances to its rhythm. At first, they stretch their arms toward the ground. Like this. This is the Little Hunger dance. The dance of the people who are hungry. And as the dance continues, their arms slowly rise and reach toward the sky. This is the Great Hunger dance. The dance which seeks the meaning of life. They dance from early evening until deep into the night. As they dance, Little Hunger gradually turns into Great Hunger. I can't explain it in words. You need to see it for yourselves. Then show us. - Really? - Yes. Show us. It sounds interesting. Okay. I'll try. But I need a beat. Please clap your hands. Like this. And slowly, it turns into Great Hunger. A little calf is sitting on a hot pot Crying out loud Mommy! Oh, my butt is burning up A little calf is sitting on ice Crying out loud Mommy! Hello? Jong-su, where are you? Are you home? Yes, I'm home. I knew you'd be home. Listen, I'm heading there now with Ben. Here? What for? We were driving by. When I told him I used to live there, he said he wanted to see it. We're on our way now. We'll be there soon. Hi. What's that sound? That's the North Korean propaganda broadcast. North Korea is right over there. Interesting. It's disappointing that my old house is gone. It used to be right over there. Now it's gone without a trace. And the well is gone too. There used to be a well next to our house. I fell into it when I was little. Do you remember? You fell into a well? How old were you? Maybe when I was seven? I fell in while playing by myself. I was looking up from below and crying for hours. I was terrified that I'd die if nobody found me. But then his face appeared. Jong-su found me, and I was rescued. But he doesn't even remember. I brought some food. Okay. I feel like I'm at my house. My old house. This isn't bad. Except for the smell of cow poop. This is nice. This may be my best day ever. I feel like smoking pot. Want to join me? Pot? Marijuana. I can't stop giggling when I smoke that. I hate my father. My father has an anger disorder. He has rage bottled up inside of him. It goes off like a bomb. Once it goes off, everything gets destroyed. My mom left my sister and me because of it. The day my mom left, I burned all her clothes. My father made a fire in the yard and made me burn them with my own hands. I still have dreams about that night. Sometimes I burn down greenhouses. Excuse me? I said sometimes I burn down greenhouses. I have a hobby of burning greenhouses. I choose an abandoned greenhouse and set it on fire. Once every two months? I think that's the best pace for me. Pace? So you burn down other people's greenhouses? Of course. It's a crime, so to speak. Just like how you and I are smoking this pot. It's a clear crime. It's very simple though. You spray kerosene then throw a lit match. That's it. It takes less than ten minutes for it to burn down. You can make it disappear as if it never existed. What if you get caught? I won't get caught. Ever. The Korean police don't care about those sorts of things. In Korea, there are tons of greenhouses. Useless, filthy, unpleasant-looking greenhouses. It's like they're all waiting for me to burn them down. And as I watch them burn to the ground, I feel great joy. Then I feel... I feel a bass sound right here. A bass that rings to my very bone. And you judge whether or not they're useless? I don't judge anything. I just accept it. I accept that they're waiting to be burnt down. It's like rain. Rain falls. The river overflows, causing a flood that sweeps people away. You think the rain judges anything? There is no right or wrong there, just the morals of nature. The morals of nature are like simultaneous existence. "Simultaneous existence"? I'm here, and I'm there. I'm in Paju, and I'm in Banpo. I'm in Seoul, and I'm in Africa. Something like that. That kind of balance. When was the last time you burned one down? Well... It was right before I left for Africa, so it's been about two months. Which means it's about time for another one. Then you must have decided which one you'll burn down next. I have. A great one to burn down. I think it'll be really fun to burn down. To be honest, I came here to scout. Scout? Does that mean it's nearby? That's right. It's very near. Very, very near... I'm in love with Hae-mi. Fuck. I said I love her. This tree has gotten really big. Why do you undress so easily in front of men? Only whores do that. I'll keep an eye out for the greenhouses. You do that. Ones that are really near. The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave a message after the tone. Hae-mi. Let's talk. Come in! This way! State your number from left to right. - One! - Two! - Three. - Four! - Five. - Six. Seven! The end! Where do you live, number one? I live in downtown Paju. It's five minutes away. - Can you work nights and after hours? - Yes, sir. Where do you live, number two? Bucheon, sir. How are you going to commute from Bucheon? It takes 2 hours. No problem, sir. I can... Where do you live, number three? Where do you live, number three? - Okay, number four. - Yes, sir. - Where do you live? - Munsan, sir. - Can you work nights and after hours? - Yes, sir. ROAD ATLAS OF PAJU CITY HAE-MI Hello? Hello? The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave a message after the tone. What are you doing? Pardon? What are you doing? I'm just looking. The phone has been turned off. Please leave a message after the tone. Hae-mi! Shin Hae-mi! What's wrong? Hello, ma'am. I can't seem to reach Hae-mi. I... need to get in. I have to feed the cat. It might starve to death. There is no cat. We don't allow pets in the building. There is a cat. I used to come and feed it. You have a master key, right? You can't ask me to open the door like that. I can get into big trouble. See? There's no cat. She seems to have gone on a trip. She cleaned up her room. She doesn't usually clean her room like this. I don't think she went on a trip. Welcome to the Crop Festival! They all seem fine, but you never really know their story. Some of them are drowning in credit card debt, and because of that some of them go into hiding. Hae-mi turned her phone off out of the blue, too. Frankly, women need to spend money on a lot of things. It's difficult for women. They complain if you wear makeup, and complain if you don't. They complain if you wear revealing clothes, and complain if you dress casually. Have you heard of the saying, "There's no country for women"? What? Nothing. Come visit and enjoy our food. Is Hae-mi here? It's been a while since she last came. I can't seem to reach her either. Fuck... Ben. What brings you here? I was passing by and saw your car outside. I thought it might be yours. Is that so? Have a seat. May I? Do you want to order something? It's okay. I have to leave soon. Are you still working on your story? I'm trying. You said you liked Faulkner, so I wanted to give him a shot. Come to think of it, I was wondering... What happened to the greenhouse? The greenhouse. You still remember that. I burned it down, of course. Without a trace. I said I would. Near my house? Of course. Very near. When? THE COLLECTED SHORT STORIES OF WILLIAM FAULKNER A day or two after I stopped by your house? That's strange. Ever since you came by, I checked every morning. I checked every single greenhouse near my house. You checked the greenhouses every day? Yes, every single one. If any one of them had burned down, there is no way I could have missed it. Yet, you have. It happens. Maybe you missed it because it was too close. I don't think so. How strange. Sometimes you can't see things that are too close to you. Ben! Sorry I'm late. Something came up at the store. It drove me crazy. It's okay. But we're running late, so we don't have time to drink tea. Hello. Are you in touch with Hae-mi? It's been a month since I last talked to her. Right? I can't reach her either. Hae-mi just disappeared into thin air. Did Hae-mi say anything to you? Like what? Like wanting to go on a trip... Or maybe... I'm not sure, but I doubt she went on a trip. She can't afford it. As far as I know, she's broke. She doesn't contact her family and doesn't have any friends. Hae-mi is lonelier than she seems. Jong-su. You know... Hae-mi thought of you as someone special. She told me so. She said you were the only person in this world she trusts. That you'd always be on her side. It made me jealous for some reason. I had never been jealous before in my life. Jong-su? Aren't you Jong-su? Yes. He is! You haven't changed one bit! How have you been? What brings you here? Did Hae-mi send you? No. Hae-mi... You couldn't have just come in here by chance, am I right? Eat. Yes, ma'am. Su-jin must be married by now. Yes, she has kids as well. She does? Do you keep in touch with your mother? No. I'm guessing that Hae-mi sent you here. So tell her she can't come home until she pays off all her credit cards. By the way, do you remember when Hae-mi fell into a well? A well? Did that happen? When she was seven, she fell into a well. She cried for hours down at the bottom of the well. Crying and looking up, just staring up at the round sky, waiting for someone to find her. I'm sorry. I was just thinking about how Hae-mi must have felt. That never happened. If it did, why wouldn't we know about it? Is that what Hae-mi told you? She makes up stories really well. Her stories are very believable. There wasn't even a well next to our house. - Good morning, sir! - Yes? I have a question. Was there a well here a long time ago? A well? Yes. A well deep enough to fall into. I'm not sure. I don't think so. Through Him, and with Him, and in Him. O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever. - Amen - Amen - Amen - Amen - Amen - Amen Hello? Jong-su. This is Jong-su, right? Yes. It's Mom. They come to my house and call me all the time. They even come to the bathrooms that I clean in a department store. In their black suits. They look like grim reapers. All that for just five million won. If only I had been younger, I'd have sold my organs. Look what I'm saying to my son who I haven't seen in 16 years. I'll take care of it. What? I'll take care of it. Don't worry. You have money? How? Mom. Yes? Remember Hae-mi's house in the middle of the village? Did it have a well? A well? Yes, it did. A dried up well. Really? Hae-mi said she fell into it once. I don't know about that, but there was a well. What's wrong? BEN Hello? Jong-su, where are you? I'm in Gangnam. Where in Gangnam? Let's see... I thought this truck looked familiar. It really was you. What brings you here? Are you here to see me? Actually, I'm here to talk about Hae-mi. You could've just called. Come inside. You're here already, so come in. You can park in our garage. Going up. Good timing, actually. My friends are coming over for dinner and drinks. Join us. You've already met them, so it'll be okay. Fourth floor. Are you having a party? It's more like a gathering, than a party. A casual gathering. You must have a lot to prepare since there are many guests. Not really. It's a potluck dinner, so everyone brings food. I just prepare the drinks and some finger foods. Someone was supposed to come early and help, but she's running late. What's that sound? Oh, I have a cat. You didn't have one last time. Right. I brought a stray cat home not long ago. It was so cute. It really is cute. Isn't it? Do you like cats? What's its name? I haven't named it yet. Naming it was more difficult than I thought. Jong-su, what kind of a story are you writing? If you don't mind my asking. I don't know what to write yet. How come? To me, the world is a mystery. Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom. Sorry, Ben. I meant to come earlier, but... - What's all this? - I bought a bit too much. Shut the door, or the cat will escape. Oh my! No! The cat got out! What do we do? Go catch it, of course. Where are you? Come out kitty. Here kitty, kitty. Come here. Here kitty. Where are you? Hey kitty. Hey kitty. Stay still. Come here. Hey, kitty. Come here, little cat. Hey Boil. Boil. Boil. Here kitty. Wow, he caught it! Amazing. How did you catch it so easily? It's very fast. Can I hold him? - Did you come out to greet us? - Yes. With the cat. Hey guys. - How was traffic? - Awful! Hello! Chinese people throw their money when they pay. - Like this. - Why do they do that? They consider money to be filthy. We treasure money, but they treat it like it's nothing. Maybe it's because they're so proud. Chinese people have a strong sense of pride. They crumple and throw their bills. They go, "Yi, er, san, si," and throw it. Like, "Here! Take it!" The Chinese are similar to the Americans. We think they're like us because of the Confucius culture. How are they similar? They're both gigantic geographically. That's true. They always place themselves at their center, whereas we're always conscious of others. Just like you. They're really bold when they ask for makeup samples. You know how stores hand them out in the streets. But our duty-free store gives them out only if you buy expensive items. I tell them loud and clear, "Meiyou. No samples. Meiyou." But they just stand there and go, "You! You!" "You have them! Give them to me!" Still, I would like to date a Chinese guy. Please do. Chinese men are so nice to their women. They treasure their women. So a Chinese man treasures his woman, not his money. He throws his money. - He should throw it at me. - Better if it's a credit card. But at the same time, he should treasure me. Korean guys won't even step in the kitchen. That's right. - I do. - That's right, you do. - What do you do in the kitchen? - He eats in the kitchen. - Seriously. - I eat too much. He does. You need to go on a diet. Look at his gut. - Is it bad? - It's not that bad. Jong-su, why are you leaving? You should stay and hang out. Didn't you want to talk about Hae-mi? I don't think I need to anymore. Jong-su. You're too serious. It's no fun being serious. Enjoy yourself. You need to feel the bass right here. You need to feel it ring from your bones. It's the only way to be alive. This case is a serious offense. The defendant assaulted a civil servant who was performing his duty. The court finds the defendant guilty of obstruction of justice, assault, and damage of property. The defendant claims this act of violence, which caused the plaintiff injury requiring six weeks of medical treatment, wasn't intentional. But the defendant swung a chair, breaking fixtures and injuring the plaintiff. Thus, the court concludes this was clearly assault. Considering that the defendant is refusing to settle, and that the plaintiff wants the defendant to be punished, and that the defendant has been penalized before for a similar crime, this court concludes that an appropriate punishment is necessary, and sentences the defendant as follows. This court sentences the defendant to 18 months in prison. Case dismissed. Come on. Climb up. Let's go. Climb up. Go. Good girl. So long. She's saying something. Hey, Jong-su! There are a lot of greenhouses here. Where's Hae-mi? You asked me to join you and Hae-mi. Isn't she with you? Subtitle translation by Jason Yu
