He's always burning something. Maud, don't do that - you'll get dirt in your fingernails. Use your gloves. No! You don't need gloves. You just put soap under your nails. Who told you that? Helen. It's an old gardener's trick. Well, it helps if you remember the soap. DOG BARKS It's all right, my love, it's all right, he can't get you. He keeps it locked up. Well, he shouldn't keep it locked up. It's not right! Shush, Maud, I don't want any trouble. Helen would keep me locked up if I let her. Well, at least she comes to see you every day. Peter only comes if he wants something. Then you can't get a decent conversation out of him. Sails in, sails out. That's Helen to a T. Always somewhere better to go. Well, she doesn't shout at you. What? Peter shouts at me. No! Mm-hm. Things go missing. And he lies about it. What things? Just things. As long as he keeps his greedy mitts off my majolica vases. Those hideous things? What do you want them for? They could be worth a fortune! Do I look old, Maudie? Cos I bloody well feel it. Spying again, Doug? - DOG BARKS - Argh! Come on, let's go in. We'll go in. It's too cold for digging. DOG BARKS Be quiet! It's getting late. Ah. You'll have to go straight home. Where else would I go? Well, you never know who's out and about. Elizabeth, did I lose something? Only your head. Oh! Right. I'll see you Thursday. Ten o'clock. Outside the Sally. Don't forget. What are you doing now? I'm going to write it down. Oh! Maudie! Sukey! What are you doing here? Looking for you! Dad's gone for fish and chips. What are you doing here? Just thinking. Come on, then. Ma's set the table. Where's Frank? London. On a job. Race you! You're not daft. You know I can't run in these heels. Was Doug in when you left? He's always in. Skulking about. I wish we had a different lodger. Oh, Maud! It's you. Hello! I've been outside for ages, waiting on Elizabeth. She's late! Are you sure you've got the right time? Well, what time is it? 10:20. Elizabeth. Ten o'clock. Sally Army. She's late. And she's never late. Er, where are you going? I was going to make a cup of tea while I'm waiting. Now, Maud, I thought we decided you weren't to do that. You don't work here any more. Remember? Oh, course I remember. Well, I'll just have to go and look for her myself. Anything could have happened to her. Not that you'd give a monkey's. If you find her, tell her I was asking for her. Bugger that for a game of soldiers! ♪ Powder your face with sunshine ♪ ♪ Put on a great big smile ♪ ♪ Make up your eyes with love... ♪ We'll go for the corner plot. It's the biggest.

Oh, where's my marrow flower, Frank? THEY LAUGH The corner plot! Hello? Elizabeth? It's me, Maud! I waited at the Sally Army. Elizabeth? Oh! "Ugly vases... "... in my way." Damn things! She hasn't got her glasses. She hasn't got her glasses! Elizabeth? Elizabeth! - DOG BARKS - Oh, go away! WHIRRING Hello, Mum, it's just me! WHIRRING STOPS You left the hoover on again. That bit of carpet must be spotless. At least you're ready. For what? We're going to the garden centre! Oh, I can't. I've got to find Elizabeth. She's not answering her door. Something must have happened to her. Her blinds were closed in the middle of the day. That's not like her. She must have gone away. She has not. She would have told me. "Elizabeth's glasses. Still there!" She'd never have gone without her glasses. You see, something's not right. Well, she'll have more than one pair. It's like talking to a bloody brick wall! God's sake, Mum, why do you keep buying peaches? You've enough here to feed an army! You can never have enough. Food goes missing. Somebody's eating it. I don't know who the bugger is. Nobody's eating it - that's the problem. No more peach slices, OK? DOORBELL RINGS Sorry, we're coming. Go and give your gran a shake. Hey, Gran. Oh! Oh, no, did you fall over? They're meant to be like this. Ooh! I've got hundreds of holes in my tights. ♪ I must be with it! ♪ Gran, what did you do that for? We nearly finished it! Oh, I had to. I need the table for my notes. To find Elizabeth. She's the only friend I've got, and now she's gone too. Gone where? Missing. Oh, don't do that! You'll muddle it all up. Right. Come on. Coat on. Oh! Gran, what is it? Hey, what's happened? It was the last time I saw her. Elizabeth? Sukey. Oh, Gran, don't cry. Mum, what's wrong? She just got a bit upset. It's all right. About what? Something about Sukey. Why did you bring her up? I didn't. She did. I don't know where she is, Helen. There. Don't upset yourself. Here, blow your nose. ... Very fine velvet material. Tourist pieces from a period of time from the early to... ... not quite the late 20th century, when tourists travelling to Japan... She'd never go out while this rubbish is on. ... pieces were not tat. They were reasonably good. So the colours will be pretty much as they were 80-odd years ago. A pair is always so much more desirable than, obviously, a single. They're really good. Oriental panel, interesting - Chinese or Japanese. Ah, Japanese! There is Mount Fuji. They look like silk panels, don't they, stitched to the original kind of backing paper. Something's not right. If I just fold the material back, now, if you turn it over, that is just a fabric. It's almost like a vel... Ah, it is. OK, so it's a crushed velvet. Very, very fine velvet material... It's only me! Who the hell's me? It's Carla, Maud. I could hear that down the street! - SHE TURNS OFF TV - What are you doing here? What I always do. Get your tea and put you to bed. I can put myself to bed! Is that thing dead? Last time I looked. Have you read this, about this woman that was attacked round here? And they haven't caught the bastard that did it! He left her with half her face smashed in. No! Right, let's see what's in the fridge. Oh, you've got a nice bit of cheddar here. Better use this up. What if she's just lying there with half her face smashed in? Don't be daft! You don't want to believe everything you read in the paper. Right, we'll just get this omelette made, then we'll get you into bed. At this time? Dear God in heaven! I'm not going to my bed now! I might just as well be dead! THUD Who's there? It's only me, Gran! Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. What are you doing in bed? Hiding from the wolf. I've got fish and chips! She's never this late. Ooh! Watch that knife, Gran! Do you want me to do that for you? No. Go to the other cupboard, pet, get the sherry out. What were you thinking about? When? Just then. Sukey. Oh, she was a real beauty, you know. I know. Just like Lana Turner. Lana Turner! If you want to talk about Sukey, Gran, you can talk about her to me. I don't mind. And don't worry, I won't tell Mum. Oh! She made all her own clothes. She made me a blue velvet bolero. I wouldn't take it off. Yeah, I bet! I can still smell her perfume. Evening In Paris. Frank gave it to her. Frank gave her everything. He was going to buy her a new house, but she never got there. The night Dad bought fish and chips - that was the last time I saw her, at the bandstand. She said she'd run after me. But she didn't. I never saw her again. Oh, Gran! Everybody said she'd run away. I didn't believe it. I looked and looked. I looked everywhere for her. Till I couldn't look any more. That's why I've got to find her. Who, Sukey? No! Oh, no! Elizabeth. My friend, Elizabeth. I've told you. She's missing and I'm worried sick. Oh, now you've got me all confused. Oh, I'm sorry, Gran. I didn't mean to. I can't keep things in my brain. It worries me. Yes, you can. You've got a system, remember? We just need to systemise it. Imagine you're like a detective looking at clues. So you have to start at the beginning. And you have to be logical. Are you sure? I'm not daft. I know you're not daft. But it would help if they had a date on 'em. Oh, right! Gran, that's not a clue. That's your shopping! There's one missing. Ooh, could that one be it? Oh, no! Who's Peter? Her son. Tight-fisted bastard! Gran! Do not say that to anyone! Why not? It's true. She's frightened of him. PHONE RINGS Oh, dear God! Oh. It's Mum. Sh! Not a sound. Hiya! Yeah, I'm still at Lucy's. No, it's fine. I can get the bus. OK, you can pick me up from the bus stop, if you have to. OK, bye. Right, I've got to go. Remember to date them from now on. Dates.Yes. Love you, Gran. Me too.

Is this about your friend? The one who's gone missing? Do you know about her? Yes, I know all about her. She lives in the new houses with the pebble wall. Thank God! Somebody with some common sense! Are you out looking for her now? Yes, we are. We've got every man in the force out. And the Flying Squad. And the sniffer dogs. Dogs? They won't hurt her, will they? Like I told you yesterday, they're nice dogs. Yesterday? Was I here yesterday? Would you like me to give you a lift home, Mrs Horsham? I wouldn't get in a car with you if you were Stirling bloody Moss! BIRD SQUAWKS Police! They're bloody useless. More than a week and they've done nothing. I'm taking matters into my own hands. Come on. Where to, Dad? Sukey's place. To see if Frank's back from London. Come on, love. There's no sign of him. Found them! Where have you been? Where do you think? Looking for Elizabeth. Look who's here. Hello, Mum. Son! Oh, thank you, God! Oh, thank you. Thank you! How's she been, your gran? Some days are good. Other days a bit confused. Mum says we have to stick to a routine so she doesn't get anxious. She used to bring us here, you know. Don't go too near the water, Maudie! Maudie, what did I tell you? SHE SCREAMS I saw her! SHE SCREAMS Mum, are you OK? Oh, er, I just got some water in my shoes. Mum's going to kill you! It's only a bit of water. I knew this woman once. Sukey reminded her of her daughter who was killed in the Blitz. She used to follow us everywhere, shouting rubbish. I didn't like it. I can imagine. Come on, then, let's get you home. No, I don't want to go home! I never get out. Your sister keeps me cooped up. Gran, that's not fair. It's the truth. I want to visit my friend, but she won't let me. She thinks I'm a burden. Oh! I've seen her in the hall mirror. Pretending to strangle me. It's not funny! I haven't seen Elizabeth in ages, and I'm worried. Anybody would be. Do you want to go and see her now? Eh? What? Your mum doesn't need to know. Drop me in town and then I can't be an accomplice. Oh, you are such a good boy! I knew you'd help me! Is this where she lives? I don't know. Oh, let me get my bearings. I'll know it when I see it. It's OK. Take your time. We're best friends, you know. I'm sure you are. We met at the Sally Army shop. She asked me for tea. She lives in the new houses. Do you know what street? I know it's near here. Do you know what, Mum? We're not that far from yours now. You might as well go home. You can always ring her or go and see her tomorrow. If Helen would let me! Oh, she will. I'll have a word with her and tell her it's upsetting you. Come on, let's get back in the car. Oh, good! That's a very good idea. I can look for Elizabeth tomorrow. Well, hurry up! I've got to get back home now. Cheerio, Mum. Cheerio! Oh! Oh! Oh, come on. Come on! SHE SOBS This is silk. How do I wash it? Cold water, I expect. - DOOR OPENS - Hello! Only me. Is, er, Sukey here? Isn't she with you? I've been in London. Why would she be with me? So where is she, then? Gone. Gone? Don't say that! Don't say it! The police found her suitcase, Maudie. Dumped on a railway line. That don't mean anything, Maudie. She's lost her suitcase. That's all that means. Your neighbour saw her running out of the house, screaming. When? A fortnight past Thursday. What's that about, Frank? Well, I don't know. She never told me. I... I wasn't there. What are you getting at? Well, if you want to ask anyone, why don't you ask your lodger? Eh? He was always hanging around. Taking her dancing behind my back. What do you mean, dancing? Was there something going on with 'em? Was there? How would I know? She wouldn't tell me if there was, would she? Sukey! Sukey! Sukey! Sukey! Do you need some help, Mum? Yes, I do. I don't know where Elizabeth is, and I need help to find her. This used to be the chophouse, Mum. Dad used to bring you here, remember? Well, come on, then, choose some food. "Chorizo-stuffed marrows." Do people still grow marrows? I know when I was young, they did. They used to grow them at the new houses. That's where Elizabeth lives. What if she's been attacked? Or kidnapped? I wouldn't know. We'll have two cauliflower soups, one pan-seared monkfish, the fishcakes, and a veggie burger? Thanks. Thank you! Families are told, but not friends. I don't understand it. Just because you're in a family doesn't mean to say you like each other. It won't be funny if something bad has happened to her. You'll be sorry then. You'll be glad I warned you. I'm sorry, Gran. Why do you think something bad's happened to her? She hasn't got her glasses! Katy! Sorry. I know what you're thinking. You think I've lost my marbles and I've just forgotten. Well, I haven't. She hasn't got her glasses, her blinds were shut in the middle of the day, and I haven't lost my marbles! Though everybody seems to think I have. Nobody listens to me! Am I invisible or something? Oh! Oh, no! Still here. I want to scream. NO SOUND Mum! Don't you "Mum" me! I want to scream, but it won't come out. It's all stuck in here. All the feelings are in here. Gran! It was hidden in Dad's vegetable patch. Somebody smashed it. Don't you even care? It doesn't matter. It's your favourite song! And now it's all smashed. It's only a record. Where did they come from? Frank brought them in. They're horrible. I hate them. From a house up the road where the woman died. Her dog was locked in with her. Barking his head off. Nobody heard him. She was just lying there. Dead. Oh, no, don't look at them, Maudie! In case they just fly out at you. Come away from there. Come and hold the other end of this for me. What are you making? A blind. So no-one can see in. What's the code, what's the code? "Elizabeth's birthday." 73! "Go round and cheer her up." What year is it? What year is it? 2019. Take away 73. Three from nine is six. Seven from one can't be done. Borrow one. Seven from 11 is four. One from 2019... 1946. One... ... four... ... six. Oh, thank you, God! Thank you, God! Thank you, God! Elizabeth? Elizabeth? It's only me, Maud! Elizabeth? WHIRRING Who's there? You mad old fool! Fool! Just a stupid mad old fool! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away. I'm not listening to you! Nosy bugger! Are you sure you want these? You bought three cans yesterday. Well, they're in my basket, aren't they? That's £4.38. Go away! Who are you talking to, Mrs Horsham? Her. That one in the corner. She's always watching. That's you, Mrs Horsham. Not her! That one! She scared my sister. "Stay away from her," Ma said. "Don't talk to her, Maudie." There's no-one there. Look. Mrs Horsham? You forgot to pay for that. BIRD SQUAWKS Birds round her head! Go away! Glass smashed! I'm not listening to you. You are mad. Oh! I'm all right, you know. What's all this fuss? You're the one who called the surgery, Mrs Horsham. And you've been doing that quite a lot recently. I have not! 12 times in the last month, to be exact. I'm so sorry, Doctor. Now, I am not suggesting that you're making things up, but I do wonder if there isn't something else going on here? Eh? Do you know what day it is today? What kind of question is that? SHE SMIRKS The 12th of August. How's that? Very good. Thank you. Do you know what country we're in? Great Britain. Only it's not that great any more. Who's the Prime Minister? Oh, I know I don't like him. Elizabeth and I do far more difficult quizzes in the Echo. Do you know where you are now? Oh, never mind all this rubbish! Answer me that. That's all that's bothering me. Well done, Mrs Horsham. Helen, we need to have a chat. Her Alzheimer's is getting worse. She's going to need a lot more care very soon. Come into the surgery and we'll discuss your options. Options? Is that what you call them? Thanks, Doctor. You're not putting me away, are you? You're not, are you, Helen? No, Mum. Of course I'm not. Oh! What are you doing? Listening to my heartbeat. Don't you touch me! You don't believe me, you won't help me find Elizabeth. It'll be all your fault if something bad's happened to her. Mum, listen to me - you've got to stop all this nonsense. Oh! It's upsetting you. Ow! It's upsetting all of us. What's the matter? My God, how have you done this? The woman hit me with her umbrella. It was flapping around like a big bird. She's mad, Helen. I'm getting the doctor back. No, don't. He'll put that fly thing in my face. I can't stand it buzzing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I'm sorry I didn't get the doctor to look at you properly. I don't like it. You don't like what? All the blanks. I held my mother's hand when she was dying. You're not dying. But you don't believe me. You don't. Nobody does. Elizabeth is missing, Helen. I know it. All right, Mum, all right. We'll phone Elizabeth's son and put an end to this once and for all. - PHONE RINGS - You don't have to stand so close. I need to hear. This is Peter Markham. I'm not here, leave a message. BEEP Hello. This is Helen Horsham. Sorry to bother you again, but my mum's very worried about your mother. They are friends, you know. He's hiding her somewhere. Ask him where she is. If you could just phone me back. My number's 07 700 900 918. Just in case. Thanks. There, happy? Phone him again. Just to make sure. I've only just phoned him. Give him a chance. A chance? He's had his chances! He doesn't take care of her. He doesn't even talk to her. Oh, Mum! That's what happens when you get old. All she wants is a bit of bloody company. That's all any of us want. Dates. There's one missing. What did it say? DOOR CLOSES What are you doing? You hungry, Doug? Where you been? The movies. What did you see? Dark Secret. Not worth the money. That's funny. It's not showing any more. Thought you weren't hungry. I might be later. Oh! Oh! They want to put me away. Nobody wants to put you away. We're just worried about you being here on your own. Look at that woman that got attacked. The one in the paper. They took everything that wasn't nailed down and left her for dead. It's shocking what some people will do. Which is why we lock the door and we go on at you all the time to keep the chain on. What's this doing in here? That's the one! I've been looking everywhere for that. Give it to me. Sukey sent it. Maud, you can't have this. It's dirty. Give it me. It's mine! If I don't have this, I can't find her! Never. Never! Oh-ho-ho-ho! Oh! Ugh! Oh! Oh! Bugger it! What's wrong? Broke a nail. Mum, that's disgusting! What have you been doing? There's dirt all up the stairs. It's everywhere! She broke a nail. What are we going to do with you, eh? It's all right, Mum. I'm just locking the door. It's locked, Mum! How will I get out? You don't need to any more. We've just had this conversation. I'll see you later. ENGINE STARTS BIRD SQUAWKS She can't live on her own any more. That's it. She'll take it better from you. That's not fair. Who are you talking to? Ha-ha! You know what they say. Talking to yourself. First sign. I'm talking to Tom, Mum. Come and say hello. Look. See him. Hey, Mum. You OK? Mum, Tom wants to tell you something. Do you fancy listening to some music, Gran? How about some Vera Lynn? Good God, no! What, do you not like her? No, I do not! Where's your mother? Oh, she's with the estate agent. Estate agent? What estate agent? It doesn't matter. Why don't you like Vera Lynn? She couldn't hold a candle to Evelyn Knight. There are no bluebirds in Dover. Load of old rubbish! Did Sukey like Vera Lynn? Are you daft? Her favourite song was Powder Your Face With Sunshine.

Who's this? Is that Elizabeth's son? Why? Who wants to know? Elizabeth asked me to call you. No, she didn't. Who is this? I'm her friend. Where is she? Are you bloody nuts? It's the middle of the night! Is it? Well, I'm not very good with time. HE HANGS UP Hello? Hello? He's hiding her somewhere, Helen. He swore at me. You called him in the middle of the night. He was angry. It doesn't matter what time it was. If a friend of mine rang you and said she was worried because I was missing, what would you say? I'd say she should be worried cos you're away with the fairies. Mum, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Do you want to keep this? I don't know what it is. Are we going on holiday? No.Oh, good. I don't think I could do it, Helen. I don't think I could do it. You're moving house, remember? You're moving in with me. To the new houses? Is Frank moving us? You're moving into MY house. I'm not coming if you're going to be like that. You haven't got a choice. We're selling the house. You're selling my house? How can you sell my house? I live here. I've always lived here. Mum, we agreed. It's not safe for you to live on your own. Who agreed? You, me and Tom. Tom? My Tom? Yes, Tom! The one who flies in from Germany twice a year and you think is wonderful. But he's not here, day after day, making sure you've got a carer, checking you haven't gassed yourself or set fire to your hair! I don't understand a word that you say. Your dinner's out, Maud. Come through and get it. You're all tangled up. What are you like? This is my last day, remember? I won't be cooking your eggs any more. You'll be glad about that. I don't want to go. Go and get your dinner. I'll tidy up in here. Carla, there's no food! He's feeding someone. Elizabeth! I knew it! You've got somebody in there. Is it Sukey? Is it? No, Maud. It's not Sukey. No! Tell me the truth. You're feeding someone. You are! Why is the mad woman's umbrella in here? Cos she's the one that's been living here, Maud. The mad woman? You've been feeding her? Why? Why? I just feel sorry for her. She just shouts nonsense all the time. What nonsense? About marrows and glass and birds. How did she get this? Sukey's comb. Where's Sukey? What's happened to my sister? Where is she? What have you done with her? Where is she? What have you done with her? Mum! Mum! I've been looking everywhere for you. Go away! Mum, calm down, it's all right. Go away! Where is she?

SHE HUMS SOFTLY I don't know if she's lost. She's missing and I'm desperate. Which is why I am appealing for witnesses. Her name is Elizabeth. Well, I don't know if her neighbour's got a shed. He has got a dog. Oh, but he keeps it locked up. Microchip? What in the name of God are you talking about? No! She's not a cat! She's my best friend, Elizabeth. And she's missing. Nobody just disappears, do they? If you know something, you have to tell me. Did she ever say anything about me? Or him? That lodger bloke. You do know something. What is it, Maudie? Tell me, Maudie! I don't know. I don't know anything. DOORBELL RINGS What the hell is this?! I don't know what you're talking about. Ask your mad old mother. I don't know. I don't know anything. Mum, go back in the kitchen, go on. Ask her. What do you think this is? Don't talk to her like that! You'll scare her. She's an old woman. She's an interfering old cow! You know what she's done? She's put a missing person's advert in the bloody paper! This is a nightmare. I don't know how she could have done this. You need to keep her away from me. This is harassment. How bloody dare you?! Right, if you don't go now, I'm going to call the police! Good. Call them. She's nuts. She should be locked up. I'm not warning you again. Last time. Keep her out of my sight! DOOR SLAMS SHUT Right, let's have a nice cup of tea, shall we? Need to tell her again. I have! I've told her a million times! This isn't right. It's in the wrong place. What is? The stairs! They're all in different places. Did he move the stairs? Why did he do that? Mum, shush now, come on, let's just go in the kitchen. Come on. Give that to me. Give that to me! Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Come on, darling. Argh! It's all right. It's not your gran, it's the illness. SHE SCREAMS What's that? What have you got? What is it, Maudie? Maudie, what is it? What is it, Maudie? It's just a letter. Who's it from? It's not from anybody. Is it from Sukey? Is it to him? It's mine! She was my wife! Silly! You'll freeze. Oh! How did that happen, eh? It doesn't matter, Mum. It does to me. You're my daughter. If you're hurt, it matters to me. I love you very much. Oh! Whoops! Hello. Are you waiting for the bus? I don't know when it's going to come. Nothing ever comes. I hope it won't be too long. Oh, is it man trouble? Well, don't you worry, he'll be back. A pretty girl like you? Hoo-hoo! I hope I wasn't being too nosy. Come on, Mum, let's go home. Helen? Helen? Helen, I didn't know you! I didn't know my own daughter! Helen! Helen! It's all right. It doesn't matter, Mum. We used to press flowers in books, Sukey and me. Marrow flowers. Helen? Mm? Where's the best place to grow marrows? Tomorrow. I'll tell you tomorrow. This isn't my house! That wardrobe's in the wrong place! We'll move it tomorrow. Made some hot chocolate. You want to have a word with that one. That girl you've hired. She's not doing what you're paying her for. Hoo-hoo! It's me, Gran, it's Katy. I don't give a snuff what your name is! Get rid of her. She's lazy. Say sorry now! Say sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Though I don't even know what I've done? Don't you ever, ever talk to my daughter like that again! Don't you ever, or I swear I'll... Go to the loo and get into bed and don't say another word! Cos I don't want to hear it. Go on! Now we're twins. What are you doing here? I come every night there's dancing. In the hope that... You come here... ... instead of going to the pictures. You're looking for her. I know what you're thinking, Maud, but there was nothing between us. We talked. That's all. Till we fell out. She wanted to put the mad woman away and I didn't think it was right. She's just an old woman. She doesn't mean any harm. How do you know? She had Sukey's comb. How did she get that, Doug? I went back, you know, after you found the comb to ask her where she got it. But she was raving. I couldn't make sense of it. What if she's not raving? What if she's trying to tell us something? We have to try and make sense of it, Doug. We have to. Under the marrows! What is it? Oh, thank God! Thank God! Mum, stop, please! Just tell me what you want and I'll find it. I want the mirror thing I found the last time I saw Elizabeth. The mad woman knows. But she's mad, so no-one listens to her. No-one listens. It's under the marrows. She's the only one who knows. Go away! Why are you always here? DOOR SHUTS Little wife! Lovely little wife! Frank, you're standing on my new blind. Get off it. Maudie, how do you make a Roman blind? Poke him in the eye. HE LAUGHS You're drunk, Frank. Go to bed. Only if you come with me. Don't be daft. It's too early. We could have a dance. You like to dance, don't you? Go home now, Maudie. There's a good girl. Go home now! Birds round her head. Glass smashed. Maud, what are you doing back here? You went home hours ago! I'm looking for the thing I lost! Please! Maud, come in now! No! I'm looking for it. I have to find it. Sh, Maud! I'm just coming over to help. Elizabeth? Help! Help me! KNOCK ON DOOR Helen? Helen? I want to see her. I want to see Elizabeth. This way. Lazy so and sos! They're sick, Mum! Hoo-hoo! She's had a rough night. You can't stay long. Thanks for letting us come. I appreciate it. Sit down, Mum. You have a rest. I'll make some tea. I might even have some chocolate in my handbag. That tight-fisted son of yours has been starving you, hasn't he? Mum! We'll go into the garden in a minute. We can dig up the birds! It's your bloody digging that's put her in this state. If it wasn't for you, she wouldn't be here. But that's right - gardening's in the bloody family, isn't it? She's got Alzheimer's. Have a heart! Five minutes, that's your lot. SHE MUMBLES Poor Elizabeth. I know. She's missing. She's not. We've just been to see her. She is. And it's all my fault. It bloody well isn't! It's his fault for not taking better care of his own mother! He should have made sure the garden was safe. It is not your fault. Do you hear me? OK? I just gave up. I knew something wasn't right. I should have listened to the mad woman. She knew. All those years, in the garden where the marrows were, waiting for me. That's where I should have looked. That's where she was. Elizabeth's not in the garden now, Mum. She's in the hospital. You've just seen her. She is in the garden. She's been there for years. Whose garden? Your old garden? The new houses. Where the marrows were. You don't mean Elizabeth, do you, Mum? She is in the garden by the wall. With the pebble stones. Right, that's it. Get in. I'll dig the whole fucking thing up, if that's what it takes. I've had it with missing people and sick people and with people! I've had it with missing people's sons an' all. So we'll dig to fucking Australia if we have to! BIRD SQUAWKS Oh, where's my marrow flower, Frank? SHE LAUGHS Helen, where's the best place to grow marrows? For God's sake, Mum! You need sunlight. And a fence for wind protection. Ouch! What? Nearly got a bit of fucking metal in me eye! Your language is shocking today. Shoe buckle. Oh! Oh! I've been looking everywhere for you. There's something else here. Mum, go and stand by the house. Go on. Go over there now! Mrs Horsham? I'm Detective Sergeant Grainger. Come and sit down here. Mrs Horsham, do you understand what was found in the garden? According to your daughter, your sister, Susan Jefford, formerly Susan Palmer, went missing in August, 1949. Sukey. Was that what you called her? So Sukey went missing 70 years ago, and you never heard from her again? The glass dome smashed and all the birds flew round her head. That's what the mad woman said, but I didn't listen. Sukey hated those birds. She was frightened of them. It was Frank's fault. He brought them into the house. Can you tell me anything about Frank? He shouted at her once. He shouted at Sukey? And Dad never liked him. Did Frank have something to do with this house, Mrs Horsham? Frank and Sukey were going to move here. He promised her. Long before Elizabeth lived here. He'll be here in a minute. What do you think happened to Sukey? Sukey will come back from the dancing and take off her blue dress and she'll lay it over the chair. Then Frank will come in. She'll say, "I thought you were in London," and he'll say, "I came back to catch you dancing... "... with the lodger." And she'll say she wasn't. And Frank will shout. And she'll say she's had enough and she's leaving. Because she's like the birds. And Frank will beg her not to. And she'll powder her nose. And Frank will cry and do something. He'll push her into the mantelpiece and she'll fall. And the glass dome smashes on her. And all the birds tumble out. And Frank packs her suitcase and puts her in a tea chest... ... and buries her where the new houses are going up. Under the marrows. I don't want gaps in it like what you've got over there. INAUDIBLE Here. How's the cake? It's the wrong kind of cake for a wedding. It's a funeral. Elizabeth's funeral. Where am I? Elizabeth's house. Did I tell you? Elizabeth is missing.
