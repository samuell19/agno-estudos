Father Carnazza. - I want to confess myself. - Later! - Shh! - No! - They are so many! - Ah! - No! I said no! I don't want to do the entire act. - My husband is still warm in the tomb. - What the shit are you saying? He' still warm? That cuckold died 3 years ago! "A peek at a naked breast, 100 grams of good coffee." "Both breasts, 300 grams of sugar." "A kiss without the tongue, half a kilo of flour." "With tongue, a kilo of fine Naples pasta." "Kiss with the tongue and naked breasts" "3 porcelain coffee cups and their plates." "A light touch of naked breasts, a real silver teaspoon." "A kiss for each nipple " a role of very fine muslin for shirts." And we are still in the higher part. What else do you want? - That lamp is lovely. - You like it? - Very much. - I'll give it to you. I am a bit sorry, though. It is a dear memory of my sister Agatina. The Lord called her. I don't care. I want it. Then let's play a game. You know what, Father? I rented my house in Vigata on the sea. - To who? - The mediator said it's for a foreigner. He's the new chief inspector at the mills. He works here in Montelusa. I don't know him personally. - What are they? - They're called "bananas". They grow in Africa. A friend of mine who travels at sea brought them. I ate one. It's divine. We'll play a game with these two. Oh! No. I'll feed you. As one does with children. More. - I kiss your hands. - Who are you? - Caminiti, your office usher. - How do you know who I am? You aren't chief inspector of the mills, Bovara Giovanni? - Again, how do you know who I am? - You're the only foreigner. - Where is the superintendence. - Two minutes away. - Let's go. Take the bags of his excellency to Hotel Gellia. This data say you were born in Vigata, a few kilometers from here. When you were 3 your went to Genoa where your father found a job. - You studied in Genoa where you got a diploma as accountant. You won the Administration contest, and had a brilliant military service in Modena, Bologna, Reggio Emilia. - Right. - I heard the situation in Emilia isn't peaceful. - It isn't. - It's not peaceful here, either. The tax on grinding went up. In 1972 the tax was doubled and the price of bread went sky high. Here in Sicily, the people were fed up and did a demonstration. There were four deaths and 18 people injured. - It's just to have you understand... - I understand. To do your job as inspector, you'll have at your disposal a carriage with a "gnuri". I didn't understand. Right! You're a Sicilian who speaks the Genoa language. A "gnuri" here, is a coachman. No need. I will use a horse. I ride fairly well. You could have bad encounters on the road. Did you hear what happened to your predecessors Tuttobene and Bendico? One disappeared at sea, the other was killed and given to dogs to eat. - I know. - And so? - I go around armed. I've a license. - I'd like to see my office now. - Sure. - You've any orders to give me? - Oh, no. Advice. Useful for someone like you who has never been to Sicily. That way. - What is this mess? - What? - What is this disorder? - Yeah! - What does that mean? - Nobody from superintendence wants to put his hands on Bendico's papers. - Why? Whoever does, risks getting bit by some animal. By a tarantula, a viper. You had better not rummage in these papers. You'd better not expose yourself. Mind your own business. Listen, pack everything up and take if to be burned. - Did I explain myself? - No, not at all. - Go get me bread, cheese and a glass of wine. - You'll eat here? - I can't - Incredible! I got stuck with an imbecile usher! - I'll shoot him! - No. - I will shoot that priest! - Calm down, Don Meme. Calm down, my ass! I'll shoot Father Carnazza. - So help me God! - Lower your voice. They'll hear. I don't give a darn! He is slowly sucking my inheritance. Don Meme, listen. The sentence for the Pircoco place will be in our favor. - As much as I know about law... - Attorney Losurdo! You know as much about law as a goat does! - You wanted to appeal, huh? - You know what'll happen? - What? - They'll stick it up your ass! Sentence and all! - So much stuff! How much did you spend? - Nothing. - Nothing? At the trattoria I told them it was for the new mills inspector. - Someone there offered to pay. - Did you accept? - What could I do? It was Don Coco Afflitto. - Who is he? - A guy. Take the tray, go back, and thank the gentleman. - Then come back here. - But you won't eat. - No, I won't. Go on! - Excuse me, but you are looking for trouble. - Tell me something. - Did Bendico work in this mess? - No, he was very neat. - Then who came here? - Don Ciccio La Mantia, and attorney Fasulo. - Are they superintendent men? - No! - Then who are they? - I don't know. - You said their names. You must know them. - What are you saying? It's one thing to know their names, and another is knowing who they are. - Why did you let them in? - Superintendent La Pergola's orders. Go on. Everything here is mine! Mine! Nobody must touch anything! Nothing! It's all mine! You can't touch anything! Nothing! It's mine! Mine, all mine! All mine! Mine! The Piroco place is mine! Mine! It's mine! Mine! Mine, and nobody is to touch it. Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Ah! Caminiti! Caminiti! Caminiti! - Where were you? - I had a physical necessity. -You scared me! - Take these away! - Burn them? - Yes. - Right. Those? - Not these. - Why? - I want to look at them tomorrow. Alright. "Your excellency." Thank you. - Mr. Bovara? - Yes. Good evening. - Good evening. - I am hungry. - Could I eat something? - Sure. The police delegate, Spampinato, was looking for you. - He asks that you go to the delegation. - Now? - It's urgent. He'll wait until nine tonight. The delegation is back here. - Ok. Will you have this taken to my room? - I'll take care of it. - Giovanni Bovara. - Delegate Spampinato? I am he, and he is my brother, Ignazio. Sit down. - You wanted to see me? The chief of police gave me a "liscebusso". I don't understand. A "liscebusso"? - Does it have to do with me? - Yes, it does. He reproached me for having left that shithead without bodyguards, speaking, as if he were alive, of your predecessor Bendico, after having received some anonymous letters. - Why does it have to do with me? - It does. You must tell me ahead of time which mills you will inspect. - Forget it. - Look... They asked me to organize a surveillance service on you. So if by chance someone shoots you, I have no responsibility. Listen, mr. inspector, your ex colleagues Bendico and Tuttobene were killed, and given to dogs and fish to eat. Is that clear? Very clear, and I repeat, that it is not possible. - May I know why? - Of course. I decide inspections the night before and don't communicate it. If someone knew, some information could leak out. In that case, there would no longer be the surprise effect. Patience. If you don't go home tomorrow, we'll look for you in some ditch. Have you finished? May I go? Goodbye. Ignazio, go to attorney Fasulo and tell him that the inspector didn't go for it. Tell him I apologize to Con Coco. I did what I could. Damn priest! Meme, you scare me. I'll call a doctor. - The Pirocco place is mine. He can't take it away. - Don't do this. - I will kill that priest! - What are you saying? Meme! - Just look. - May I remain blind. - But not naked. - No. - Because if you don't look and start doing, how will I run away naked? - No! - So, I will remain dressed. But I'll lower my panties to the floor and you can look at it. Alright, as you wish. - A couple of sheets, we said. - I'll look in front and behind you. If you want to look behind, you must give me another pair of sheets. - Alright. - Go get them. What a bore! Here. Now let's go in the bedroom. Why? If you will only look, we can do it here. What you told me, Teresa, is a delicate matter. So delicate that I should tell his excellency the bishop, about it. - Good morning, Pippinedda. - Good morning, Father Carnazza. Sorry to bother you. I wanted to confess myself. - Sit down. I have finished. - No, I'll come back another time. - Have a good day. - Have a good day. Goodbye. - What'll we do? - What'll we do? Can't you see the sea is rough? It's scary just to look at it. It scary just to look at it. It's scary just to look at it. - You say "accussi"? - Yes, "accussi facimmo". "Accussi" you say. "Accussi facimmo". This is how we'll do it. "Accussi"? "Accussi facimmo". To "vossia"! "A vossia", to you. A vossia! Are you talking to me? - I brought the horse. - My name is Michelino. - My pleasure. - He is a beautiful animal! - Beautiful? There isn't another one like him in Sicily. You can talk to him. - He understand better than a person. - I should learn Sicilian. - Yes. - What is his name? - Stidduzzo. - Stellino. - I can already speak it. - My mother was Sicilian and I was born here. May I? - Go ahead. Stellino. Here we are. Come. Really lovely. Here we are. Good morning, madam. - I am Teresa Cicero, the landlady. - Sorry. I didn't think that... I'll go put something on and be right back. - Madam, excuse me about earlier. - What did you do? - I didn't think you would come personally. - Did that bother you? Absolutely not. - This is your house. - You like it? - Very much. I liked it too. When my husband was alive, we used to come here. We took long walks among the olive trees. Then, at sunset, we went along the seashore. The sound of the sea at that hour is lovely. There was peace... Are you missing anything? Sheets? - Yes, excuse me. - Why excuse yourself? - I didn't bring them. Michelino is in the back. I am having him pick fruit for you. - Michelino! - I'm coming, madam! - I brought a basket full. - A welcome gift. - Thank you. - Shall I have more brought? - No. I'll pick them later myself. Do you know when to pick it? - Are you married? - No, no. I don't even have a girlfriend. - Where are you going? - To the country. - You're sick. - No fever. Look here. You apply yourself too much. One doesn't shoot with your heart but with the brain. If you want, I can teach you. "It is a real abuse of power." "A tax on wheat and all that is taken to be ground at the mills "is a way of ruining our people and our land." "The people's malcontent flows underneath like a river." "The murder of the mills inspector, Gerlando Tuttobene, is a testimony of this." - Mr. Bovara! - Mr. Bovara! - Who are you? - What do you want? - Don Coco Afflitto sends us. He lives nearby. He'd like to know you personally. If you would like.. - What? - If you accept to go eat with him this evening. I'm sorry. I already had dinner. Thank him very much. As "vossia" wishes. - The altar's silver candlesticks? - Yes. - They are a gift from Marquise Torrenova. - I don't give a darn. - I want them. - Teresina, dear, be reasonable. They are not mine. They belong to the church! The marquise will notice. She comes every day! Just tell her that thieves stole the candlesticks. - But if she comes... - Father, this is how things stand. You give me the candlesticks and we'll do the complete act... as husband and wife. On the bed. Otherwise, this ends here. Think about it. I'll give you until Wednesday. Teresina! - Yes? - Twice? - Just once. - Wait! - Well? No need to wait for Wednesday. Come tomorrow morning. Come in. - Mr. superintendent, good morning. - Good morning. Today I can't... I won't steal much time. I want to know who Fasulo and La Mantia are. - What? - Fasulo and La Mantia. As far as what Caminiti told me, they are two people you authorized to rummage among Bendico papers. Yes, they had my permission. La Mantia is Spampinato's deputy. He looked for leads on the murder. - Did he find anything? - No. - The other one? - The other is attorney Fasulo. A pious, generous man, ready to help others. - I don't understand. - You see, it is a delicate matter. Poor Bendico was a ladies man. It seems he had a very young lover. - Why did you let Fasulo in your office? - I told you. He is a pious and generous man. He feared that the papers contained damaging notes or letters. He didn't want that the widow, besides the loss of her husband, would have to suffer for this, too. - Thank you. - Listen! I called in all the deputy inspectors for this morning. They will continue verifying that the meters for the mills are not manipulated, that the real quantity be stated of cereal used for the milling. That is, that the taxes on grinding are not evaded. - Kiss your hands. - When you want to greet me, just say "good day". - As you wish. - Are you offended? Yes. It means you don't want to get friendly with me. "Good day" is said to strangers. Alright, do as you wish. What the... What stuff is this? May 13th... What does it mean? Come in. - The deputy inspectors are here. - Have them come in. - Please. - Abbate Nicola. - Cumella Antonio. - Brancato Ettore. - Erore Emanuele. - Baldi Pietro. - Bonluigi Orlando. - Grassi Salvatore. - Strabuzzi Ottavio. - Gesualdo Carcarò. - Filippo Fracapane. - Caminiti, get chairs for the gentlemen. - There's no need. Ok. I took over this office just a few hours ago. I was not able to yet see what problems exist, and I am sure there are some. From the papers of my predecessor, I was able to see that you were called in for a monthly report. Right? - Right. How often did Bendico come to you to verify your work? Your excellency, can we reason this out a minute? Go ahead. We must be united. I will take care of it. He never came to see us. He trusted us. It is not a matter of trusting, but of doing the work one is paid for. - That is right. It is right. When I feel it necessary, I will come to your districts to verify your work. Not because I don't trust you. Will you advise us before coming? You are all obsessed with wanting to be advised before. No, Mr. Carcaro, I won't advise you. Isn't that a lack of trust? One last thing. As of today, you will be called in every 15 days, and not once a month as has been done until now. This meeting ends here. You can go. - Please. - Good day. - Good day. - Good day. I'm coming! Don Meme, dearest! How are you? You look good, very good. - Any news, attorney? - Yes. I received news that... - It's not official. - Come to the point. - The sentence we requested on the ownership of... - Pircoco's place. - Yes. It will be... - Will be? Will be... It isn't in our favor. The place will be assigned to Father Carnazza. From now on, watch out about manifesting opinions, or letting yourself go with acts, words or gestures that could influence... - Everything ok? - Everything was perfect. - What is this dish called? - "Purpeteddi alla strascinasale". I'll repeat, pur... pur... Purpeteddi alla stasinasale. - Very good. My mother often talked about them. It was one of her favorite dishes. She was from Vigata. Tell me how much... In fact... "Me facisse u conto". - You are Bovara, the new chief inspector? - Yes. - All paid for. - By whom? - Don Coco Afflitto ordered that I don't let you pay. - No. - Tell me how much it is. - Listen, Mr. Inspector. I cannot take your money. No, you listen. I am leaving the money anyway. I will pay for my bill. Is that clear Put it there. - Get the bed ready for him. - Yes. - The sheets must be taught. - I'll check later. - Certainly, madam. Fine pasta, sugar, silver spoon. "The red circles are fines for less important offences." "While the blue ones are real offences, "like manipulating accounting books or not reporting the milling." "The precise deadlines are marked, following an established order." "The millers pay a fixed amount to the deputy inspectors who do not carry out controls, and allow for them to evade taxes, how and when they want." "With this system the mills were not inspected, and they were allowed big earnings, that Bendico shared with this deputy inspectors." That is what Fasulo and La Mantia were looking for. Not love letters as the superintendent led me to believe. I need evidence. Evidence that will nail them all down. Montelusa, September 3rd, 1877. I, the undersigned, "I, the undersigned Bovara Giovanni, chief inspector for mills, state that in the meeting with the deputy inspectors that I called in, for September 18th, the following will take place." "The deputy inspector Abbate Nicola will state having found a serious offense in the San Giuseppe mill." "Deputy inspector Brancato Ettore will state two slight offences in the Santa Lucia and Cristo Re mills". "Deputy inspector Cumella Antonio, one slight and one serious offense in the San Gerlando and San Calogero mills." "The remaining deputy inspectors will not find any offence." "For this letter addressed to myself, the postal stamp is its verification. Caminiti! Yes, sir. I'm leaving. I've a lot to arrange. - Nobody is left in the offices. - Don't they close at eight? Everyone leaves here at six. I must go to the postoffice and the barber. Where can I leave my horse? At the carriage shop. There is always a carter. - Give me the envelope. I'll send it at the post office. - No. - It's a private letter. - What? Bontempo writes to his girlfriend. - Crisafulli writes to his brother. Everyone writes here. - I don't care. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. They stole the candlesticks! Holy Mary, the priest is sick! Rocco, call for help. Father, what is going on? He is dead. # You are not a world for me. # I'm not for you anymore. # All already my affections # I gave them to my Jesus. # - Are you a foreigner? - Well, yes! You won't believe it, I'm Sicilian. I am from Vigata too. Just a moment. You're the new chief inspector from Reggio Emilia whose last name is Bovara? - Yes. Your father was Pietro and your mother Di Stefano Carmela? Who are you? My mother's name was De Stefano Pippa. She was your mother's big sister. We are first degree cousins! How exciting. I've found you! Alfredo, close the store! I'll take you home and have you meet my wife and children. You are family! - You must catch that bastard. - Bastard. - When did you close the church? - At 2, after lunch. - I opened it up again at 4. - Did you light the candlesticks? - N I only light them during Sunday mass. - We must check the area. - Where? - What do you mean? In church, in the sacristy, and if need be, even in your lodging. Heavens! A search in my home! A sacrilege! In church it is, but not in your home. What are you saying? The church belongs to everyone, the house is mine. If you search my home, the flames of hell will burn you for eternity. - For eternity. Anathema on you, on your children. Alright. We'll only look in church. - So you're at the home of the widow Cicero. - Yes. - She seems like a good woman. - Sure! She's a... What're we doing? - Go sleep! Serafina, take the children to sleep. - Let's g I was saying that Teresina Cicero is a big slut. She is a slut? Yes! She is beautiful, there is no denying that. But she is vicious. She cheated on her husband with half the town. Then she got engaged to the brother of the delegate, Ignazio Spampinato. Then with attorney Fasulo, after that, with Father Carnazza. - With the priest? - With the priest. - You mean Father Carnazza? - Yes. - I found something out today. He's making his cousin Meme Moro go crazy by stealing his inheritance. All Meme has left is the Pircoco place. But that may go to the priest, too. Who will stop Don Meme? - He'll surely shoot him, - Speaking of shootings, it seems that they killed Bendico because the money he got for not inspecting the mills, was not enough. - The millers killed him? No! If they order them to say that wine has become water, they say it. Speaking of water, Inspector Tuttobene didn't fall into the sea. He was thrown in it for the same reason for which Bendico was found in the ditch eaten by dogs! Cousin... "Following my finding a very important document, in the office of the deceased Bendico, I left for the vast feud called "Terrarossa" which is under this superintendence for cereal production." "It belongs to Mr. Nicola Afflitto, known as Coco." "Neither inside the feud or in the nearby territories, is there a mill." "Moved by the will to ascertain it, the other day I left for Zammut." "I arrived there at sunset." What are they doing? Where are they going? They are armed. Incredible! It's a mill! "A mill made of wood and well hidden, was in front of my eyes." "I got to Montelusa in the morning an asked to talk to Prefect Palasotto, who expressed marvel and condemned the offenders." Because of urgent commitments. I can't take care of it today. - Sir, it is a very serious thing. - Don't worry. I'll give you my card to take to the Carabinieri head, Lostracco. Why did the prefect send you here? All my men are working. - Captain, what should I do? - Go to Chief of Police, Marcuccio. The prefect should have told you to go there. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I acknowledge the seriousness of this crime, but I cannot intervene. It would be intruding in the Reali Carabinieri's domain. "My begging got no results." "So I returned to the Carabinieri and asked to see Lostracco." I'll try to get 2 available men right away. Maresciallo Purpura! - Yes, sir? - Bring me a map of the area. - Right away. Indicate where you saw the clandestine mill. Here, more or less. "I hope to soon have you receive my new report..." - "With the Carabinieri's intervention." - And what is this? - The report of the situations I experienced. Wasn't a chat enough? - It's my duty to make out a report. - I'll tell you what your duty is. From now on, you must advise me ahead of time of every step you take. Especially when you find a need to advise other authorities of facts that concern your direct superior, meaning myself! Hierarchy has no part in this. The fact is a serious one. - Enough. I told you everything. Go. Is this the place? Yes, it is, maresciallo. Excuse me. Sir, excuse me! - Wasn't there a mill here? - A mill? Are you kidding?- Just answer. You think if there was a mill, we'd be here busting our asses? Someone says they saw a wooden mill here. That person was either drunk or out of his mind. Only we work here. This place is ours. Don Coco Afflitto rented it to me three years ago. "Excellency, district attorney Rebaudengo, the undersigned Bovara Giovanni, mills chief inspector at superintendence, attaches to the present letter..." "One, copy of the letter written by me and sent to myself, on last September 3rd." "Two, copy of my report to the superintendence of September 10th." "Three, copy of the report by the Carabinieri maresciallo to Captain Lostracco, dated September 15th." "Four, reports given to me on September 18th by deputy inspectors confirming, point by point, what was written by me in point one." "You can reach the appropriate consequences." "I also bring to your illustrious attention, that the owners of the 82 mills that are active in this province, have a common company seat in Montelusa, in a place that is owned by Mr. Nicola known as Coco Afflitto." "The 82 mills are represented by only one attorney, Mr. Gregorio Fasulo, the same that told the superintendence which deputy inspectors to hire." "I remain at your disposal, accountant Bovara Giovanni." The end of the world has come. Secretary, write. To Captain Francesco Gustavo, Regia Guardia di Finanza corps. Commander, the present letter is to have you send me a detailed report of the assets of Nicola Afflitto and attorney Gregorio Fasulo, residents of Montelusa, where they carry out their business and where they operate from. Considering the delicacy of the assignment, I personally went to the Terrarossa feud belonging to Coco Afflitto. Look, there isn't one strand of grass The ground is levelled, as if an excessive weight had been put there. I feel, that following the report made out by Bovara... how can I say it... a diabolical magician's act was performed. Someone had every trace of the wooden mill disappear. I had said it. The end of the world is here. I won't leave Pircoco's place to the scoundrel Priest! Cuckold! I'll take care of it. That priest is sucking up all I own. He won't even leave my underwear! We must consider that your cousin, Father Carnazza, is a man of God. Fasulo, if Father Carnazza is a man of God, I am the pope! Excuse me. I am here because only Don Coco and you can help me. You will have all my gratitude. Ok. Don Meme, don't worry. I'll will refer this, and let you kno Alright. Who goes there? Father Carnazza! Father Carnazza! - Shoooo... t... - What? Shoooo.. t... - Shooo...t... - Yes? - "Moro". - I don't understand, Father. "Moro"... "cuscinu". Where will I find a cushion here? Fu... k... it... Come in. - What happened? - Don Meme shot the priest near the river. - Then everything went well. - Yes and no. - The mills inspector arrived, the one called... - Christ! - That is not good! What did he do? - He thought they were aiming at him. He got scared and fired a shot in the air and went up to the priest. - Father Carnazza said something. - Are you sure? - It seemed so. My God! He could have said that Don Meme killed him. Don Coco had promised him that nothing would happen. If Bovara says Don Meme's name, Don Coco's reputation is ruined. It would have been better if he'd killed him. - What manners! - There has been a homicide. - Did you understand what I said? - I understood. You know how many murders took place this year in the province? Thirty-eight! This makes thirty-nine. - Tell me everything. - This morning I was coming from a mill inspection. - We'll talk about that later. Did you see the fact? - Not really. But I heard the gun shot, very close. - I thought it was meant for me. - You think someone could shoot you! - Continue. - I heard a shot. Then I saw a man on the ground and heard the murderer running away. - Did you see him? - No. - How can you say it was the murderer? - He was running from the place of the shot. Nobody was there. - No. You were there, but didn't run away. Go on. Then what did you do? I went to the dying man to help him. When I realized it was too late, I ran here. - Wasn't it better to take the injured man to a doctor? - He died. - You don't know who he was. - I know! He was Father Carnazza. I met him in the square. - Caminiti introduced him to me. - Did he tell you anything? - Yes. Father Carnazza said "shot" or "spaiato", something like that. Then he took my arm and said, "Moro", cuscino." - And then? - I thought he wanted a cushion but he told me to fuck off. He was exasperated because I couldn't understand. But then it all became clear. Someone had told me about the tense relationship with the priest and his cousin Meme Moro. So I understood. He wanted to tell me that he had shot him. - It's safe? - Certainly not. - Father Carnazza ... - Ignazio, take care of the accountant. Bring him what he wants, but you do not have to get out of here. No, the accountant makes it all up. He's too imaginative! Like the time he spoke of the ghost well to smear the name of don Coco Afflitto. Don Meme Moro has nothing to do with this. I'm certain of it. This morning he was in bed with a high fever. Doctor Landolina who went to visit him said so. Are we going to doubt the word of an honest man like Landolina? Don Meme couldn't even get out of bed to go for a piss. - Is that clear?- very clear, lawyer Fasulo. But what should I do - You're asking me? You do your job.- Of course. - Are you not hungry? Don't you want to eat?- No. Ignazio! He's my second-in-charge, La Mantia - Have you found father Carnazza? - We'll talk about it later. I need something clearing. You have a revolver. Yes. I do... I do. - I shot the killer, as he ran off.- Where is it? I forgot it next to father Carnazza when I assisted him. Did you find it? The priest said that he was shot by his cousin Moro. Is that so? Mister delegate, what father Carnazza said was not clear. - What, now you're taking it back? - No. I'm only saying father Carnazza sai other things I didn't understand. But he was clear. At a certain poin he said: "Fu Moro, cuscino". Accountant, do you know our dialect Yes. My parents were from Vigata and I was born here. Do you know what the word "moro" means round these parts? - Dark-skinned. - Just this?- No. - Also "I die".- You see how long before it becomes a Surname? And you also mistook the word "cuscino" with the word "cusscino". - It's the same word. - No! - Yes! - No. If I want to say "pillow", I use a double "s", "cusscino". If I want to say "cousin", I only use one, "cuscino". - Do you get it? - Tell me something. - Did the father said "fu moro" in one breath? - I don't understand. You're a learned man, you know how to speak. It's one thing to say "fu moro" all in one breath. It's completely different to say "fu... moro". - They mean the same thing! - Are you joking? - No! - It's not the same. If I pause, it means I was about to say who shot me. Then I feel so much pain that it makes me say I'm dying and not the killer's name. Indeed in this case, "moro" is not the name. - It's a verb. - So I ask again. Was there a pause or wasn't there? You two are going to drive me insan with your quibbles over dialect! Which quibble, sir? We have to see if you're telling the read truth or a convenient one. - Are you insane? - You speak of insanity too often. What interest would I have in framing Meme Moro? We don't know your interests. But let me tell you one thing. You'll get it in your head that don Meme has nothing to do with it. - Not at all. - How can you be so sure? There's a very respectable witness. What do you say now, esteemed accountant? Can I have a glass of water? Everything Ok? Were there complications? - No, everything's Ok. - Sciaverio. You have to do one last thing. - So Bovara will be fucked in secula seculorum.- Amen. - You know Teresina Cicero's house? - Yes, when you fucked her, I... Sciaverio! It's old news, forget about it. Forgotten. Anyway, donna Teresina has three houses. Now she's here, in Montelusa. You need to go and speak to her. - What should I say? - That she must disappear for a bit We'll take her away from the villag until the dust settles. What if she says no? You explain to her that you'll have to break her neck like a chicken. Such a fine mind, don Coco! My respects. Let's go. Are you better? Can we continue? I want to know something. Why do you like making up stories? - What have I made up? - The story of the non-existing mill. - Or that don Meme shot the priest. - Or that the priest was killed. We didn't find father Carnazza where you said, or anywhere near. - No! - You want to know something? You made up the shooting. No. I didn't... What did you do when he fainted? We called the doctor who gave him some medicine to sleep. - What do we do when he wakes up? - You take him to his house. Your faults don't warrant prison. Of course, you carry a heavy burden on your shoulders. Public disorder, spreading false rumours. Defamation. But then, as a Christian, I put my hand on my heart and say "Are these faults or is he a madman who speaks without understanding?" Okay, I get it. - We can't do anything. - No, you can do something. - It's your duty to. - Explain yourself, lawyer. You have to write a four-copy report on the matter, immediately. You have to tell the story as it is not a word more, not a word less. Send the first to the commissioner. The other three to the prefect, the commander of the Carabinieri and the King's solicitor. Maybe somebody was investigating based on this madman's statements. - So they stop in time and avoid looking bad. Clear? - Absolutely. But can you write the report? It would take me all day. Accountant! Wake up, it's dark. We'll take you home. - I can't ride. - Don't worry, we'll take you. You get some rest and we'll pick you up tomorrow. Come back and we'll give you the horse. - Have you found father Carnazza? - No. Did you get scared, father? You did well. Commend your soul to the Lord. This is for all the things you stole from me! Bang! < Are you in? < Anybody home? Come in, lawyer! I'm in bed. - Don Meme. - I'm in bed because I have a fever This morning doctor Landolina told me to get some rest. Don Meme... - Did you know father Carnazza was apparently shot?- Yes, I was told.. - Why "apparently"? - Apparently. - Bovara told Spampinato he'd found him dying.- I know. But when Spampinato went looking for the priest or his corpse He found nothing. - Nothing? - No, he wasn't there. This is what they're saying. Maybe father Carnazza was wounded, the accountant thought him dying. I think the father recovered and run off to hide and get cured. Now whoever shot him is in trouble. They thought him dead and see him come back. This father Carnazza... Damn priest! I'm better. Tomorrow morning around eight we'll come and pick you up. Good night. Father Carnazza? No... No! Father Carnazza! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! I have nothing to do with it. We'll put Bovara on a chair. - You didn't cuff him immediately? - No, he seemed like a ragdoll! Father Carnazza was killed with a firearm. He was hit in the top of the chest, as you said this morning. Is this yours? It's my revolver, but as I told you. I put it down beside father Carnazz when I leant over him. A single shot was fired. Father Carnazza was killed exactly by a single shot. It's useless, there's nothing to do! So I and my second-in-charge La Mantia cuffed Bovara. < And we carried out the search. < La Mantia went around the house. This mule belongs to father Carnazza. < While I inspected the house and after a while... These are father Carnazza's candle holders, the stolen ones. < Then I discovered that the linens in Bovara's house had the letters of father Carnazza' first and last name. So they belonged to his set. < So I began to understand the motive of the murder. It's known the Cicero widow had carnal relations with Carnazza. She met Bovara and must have fallen for him. The priest, discovering the affair, went to Bovara to speak to him. There he saw the candle holders and became furious. So Bovara shot and killed him. - Did you interrogate Cicero? - I tried, she's nowhere to be found Cicero's hiding leads to believe she's involved with the murder. - Flawless. - Just one thing. Why did Bovara organize this act? In delegation he claims to have see the dying priest by the river. - Then he has the body recovered at his home? - Let me explain. Bovara starts his relation with Cicero and makes her carry on her affair with the priest so he can rob him. Father Carnazza discovers the scam and threatens to report them both. So Bovara and Teresina, given the risk, decide to kill him. Bovara immediately begins to act insane. He makes up that crazy story about the non-existing mill. He kills Carnazza in the house and comes to the delegation. There he tells me he saw the priest being killed elsewhere. His real plan was to act crazy so he wouldn't be charged with voluntary pre-meditated murder - It's all clear. - I agree. Let's hope the examining judge has the same lucidity. It wasn't me. I didn't do it. It wasn't me. I have nothing to do with it. I don't... "Non ce trasu nente". I... "Non ce trasu nente." It wasn't me! "Li purpeteddi alla strascinasale." I like... I like "taliare u muru". The chair. The chair. "Bono il purpeteddu." "Non ce trasu nente." The sheets... "Chissu", This is a game. "Hai a fare" you're playing my game They are treating me like a "minchione", an idiot. - Good morning, accountant. - Your Honour, my regards. My regards? You're speaking dialect? Your Honour, I'm a good chess player, you know? - How is that relevant? - It is. You see... I've been thinking all night about a game plan. I see that for me, now, the best move to make is the "cavaddo", the horse. The horse? What do you mean? Why do you keep speaking in dialect - You lived in Genova. Speak Italian - No, Your Honour. - I can't speak Italian. - Why? Because the only way for me to make no more mistakes is to speak and think only in Sicilian. There's an article by don Coco Afflitto! It's a bomb. Listen. "D.A. Rebaudengo has begun an investigation" "into my business claiming I am the hidden puppeteer" "of shady affairs". What did I say? Listen, that's not all. "Do you know where he gets his moves for his damaging plot" "He is basing his investigations on the words of Bovara Giovanni" "who is in jail for the murder of a Man of God" "priest Artemio Carnazza." "What value can the words of a killer hold with a magistrate? "Have we come this far?" Don Coco Afflitto. Solicitor, this is a personal attack. - What do you want to do? - What do I want to do? My job. Let's continue on don Coco Afflitto and on lawyer Fasulo. - At least until it's possible. - There's also this. - They've just delivered it. - What is it? A letter from Pintacuda, the Judge in the priest's murder. - What does he want? - He read the article by Afflitto. And found out about your investigation. - He wants a meeting about it. - A meeting? Certainly. Don Coco! Great news! Sit, lawyer. Tell me. (Buzzing) "We receive news that D.A. sir Ottavio Rebaudengo" "was transferred, effective immediately" "to the Royal Court of Genova." We won! Continue. (Buzzing) "Rebaudengo will be replaced by Antonio Lacalamita" "current D.A. to the King in Catania" "where he received praise for his careful composure." < That's what you do with mosquitoes, squash them all. < If there's even just one left, it's like nothing was done. - Good morning, mister Bovara. - My regards, Your Honour. Again with the "regards". What's with the dialect? Until this story is over, I'll only speak and think "accussi. - It's irrelevant to the questioning - That's what you say. Okay, let's continue. - Is there anything to change in your story to Spampinato? - No. - So you confirm finding the body of father Carnazza by the river. - Yes How do you explain that the body was found in your home? I believe, they took the body to my house. So when I got back, I would find it and they would frame me. You see, that morning I said I'd found the priest in one place. I couldn't then say: "I was wrong, the priest is in my house". I would have to hide the body. This way it would be easier to frame me for the murder. Does that sound reasonable? Well... More than reasonable, I'd say fictional. You have enemies so clever they'd devise such a plan? Did they tell you about the mill that was there and then it wasn't? Doesn't that seem like a good way to make me appear insane? Tuttobene was drowned and Bendico was shot. They're trying to make me die in a jail cell or an asylum. Do you know Mrs. Teresina Cicero? - I rented a house she owned. - Did you have an affair with her? I only saw Mrs. Cicero once. Did you know Carnazza's linen was found in your house? I told Mrs. Cicero that the sheets were missing. She brought them one day I wasn't in. - The candle holders? - Those, too. - Weren't you surprised? That women had given you a valuable gift for no reason. I did wonder. Then I understood the gifts weren't for me, they were for the house. She was trying to make it pretty to rent it better after I left. - Why don't you ask her? - She's nowhere to be found. - Nowhere to be found! - No. - Of course. I think they killer her or scared her off with death threats. - Why? - Your Honour. If you could question Mrs. Cicero, she would tell you the truth. So the lies to frame me would no longer work. - Did you know Mrs. Cicero was Carnazza's lover? - Of course. My cousin the barber told me. He also told me about the list. - Which list? - The list of Mrs. Cicero's lovers. You exchanged a few words with father Carnazza before he died - Correct? - Yes. - You declared that the dying man said: "Fu Moro, cugino", is that right? You see, Your Honour... ...at first I didn't know about the different pronunciations. Father Carnazza said "cuscinu". I thought that meant pillow where you rest your head. Then I understood. "Cuscinu" also means something else. It can mean "cousin". Carnazza was Meme Moro's cousin and the two had a disagreement about something to do with inheritance. So I put two and two together. But La Mantia made me see that two plus two isn't always four Why did La Mantia think it didn't make four? First he explained it's one thing to say "fu moro" in one breath. Another is to say "fu... moro". Then he explained that in Sicilian the word "moro" can mean first a dark-skinned person then the verb "die", and only then it can be a surname. That's why I speak Sicilian, so I don't misunderstand words. - Do you wish to confirm or withdraw accusations to Mr Moro? - Confirm! Father Carnazza clearly said he was shot by his cousin Meme Moro Since this story started, all I think about are his words. Now I can state that father Carnazza spoke clearly. It was me who misunderstood. And what I say is true, to the poin I thought he said "fanculo", fuck off, because I didn't understand. - But he didn't say "fanculo". - He didn't say "fanculo". - No. - What did he say to you? - Slowly, Your Honour. I'll get to it. Let's begin at the beginning. When I got close to father Carnazza the first thing he said was that he'd been "spaiato". I thought he meant "sparato", shot. But what reason was there? It was clear he'd been shot. Why would he tell me? Then I understood. Father Carnazza didn't want to say "spaiato" nor "sparato". Father Carnazza was saying another name. - Which? - Spampinato. - Spampinato. The delegate? - Either him or his brother Ignazio - He has a brother named Ignazio? - Of course. He's on the list, too. - Which list? - The list of Cicero's lovers. Investigate! So father Carnazza said two names, Spampinato and Moro Is that correct? Not only those. The father mentioned Moro, Spampinato... Continue! Why have you stopped? This is the bang, the big one. The real cannonball, Your Honour. - Father Carnazza didn't tell me to fuck off. - Say the name! Fasulo. - Stop joking around! - I'm not, Your Honour. I thought about it after La Mantia Sicilian lesson. If father Carnazza had told me to fuck off, it'd have be "ulu". But he said "ulo", "Fasulo". - Is that clear? - Do you realize? - You're alluding to lawyer Fasulo. - Not alluding, reporting. Even lawyer Fasulo was one of Mrs. Cicero's lovers. Ask around. - I think they "appattarono". - What? Fasulo and Spampinato planned to kill father Carnazza who had "fottuto", fucked their woman and made them cuckolds. - Emanuele Moro? - Meme Moro? Meme Moro had thousands of reasons to shoot the priest. He joined in. They grouped together But you have no witnesses to these words nor to the fact that the body was moved from where you claim to have seen i to your house. What do you say? It's true. I have no physical witnesses. But I can demonstrate that father Carnazza was killed in one place and taken to my house. Yes? How, tell me. Spampinato told you that I stated I'd covered the body with my cape. - Yes. - There. Returning home, when I tripped over father Carnazza's body I noticed my cape was on the bed. If nobody moved it, then... It's still on the bed. But... - Why is the cape important? - It is, Your Honour. If what I say is true, if I covered the body with the cape the lining of that cape must be covered in blood. If it's not as I say and Carnazza was killed in my house then the cape must be clean. Impallomeni, go and call the delegate. Come. - Here I am, Your Honour. - Good morning. - Do you have the key to Mr. Bovara's house? - Yessir. - After arresting Bovara, did you return there? - No. - Nobody went there. - Good. Chancellor, take custody of the prisoner. Delegate, get the key and meet me outside. - The key? - Here it is. - I want Bovara transferring to the San Vito prison. - Why? For security reasons. - Is he not safe here at the delegation? -No. Advise the director that Bovara needs to be placed in isolation. Listen. You'll be responsible for Bovara's safety Until his arrival at the prison. Then I'll hand him to the director. - Do you understand? - Yes. - Impallomeni. Let's go to Bovara's house. The accountant told me the truth. - You took the piss out of me twice. - Watch how you speak. - You led me to believe it wasn't don Meme who had shot. - Calm down. Then you took the body to Bovara's house to frame him for the murder. I thought the accountant had killed him. Who had the idea? - Don Coco. - I'm pleased with this bullshit. Let's not piss out of the pot! - In these cases, calm is... - Calm! I begged La Mantia, who talks bette than me, to persuade the accountant that don Meme hadn't shot the priest. He started talking like a teacher. He gave the accountant a lesson. "In our dialect it's like this, in our dialect it's like that." He learnt his lesson and now he's fucking us. Delegate! Bovara has involved me, too. We're all in the same boat. Please! You're the only one who can't drown - Don Coco is your lifeline. - Your brother can hang on, too. Too? Ignazio is the first that has to be saved. I'm not sending him to jail. He's as innocent as Christ on the cross! Delegate! Nobody's going to jail. The chancellor has told me what the accountant told the judge and what the judge found in the accountant's house which is the blood-soaked cape, just like Bovara said. - This means nothing. - It could mean everything. It depends on the judge. - Can we talk to this judge? - No. I know he met more than once with D.A. Rebaudengo. - Shit! - We need to stop this story or it will be the end for everyone. Okay, don't worry. Don Coco will solve it. - Can I know how? - No, in your own interest. Wonderful! This is paradise! - Don Meme! Regards. - Sciaverio, come. Care for a nice sausage? I also have a wonderful wine... - Delicious. - Don Meme, it's done. - What do you mean? - The judge questioned the accountan and is now convinced he killed the priest. Like don Coco said. Lord, thank you! So I can come to the village? - As soon as you want. - Holy Maria! Exiled here in the country, it felt like being in prison. One thing. The lawyer said you shouldn't bring your rifle. - Give it to me, I'll get rid of it. - So I'll give it to you. - Yes. Wait. Here it is. - Done. Is it loaded? - Of course. - The sausages are burning. - That's a shame, they're fresh. Aliquo slaughtered the pig. Do you believe Meme Moro's suicide? - No. - Me neither. They have made their move and given the game to their opponent. - But the opponent is no longer Bovara. - Who is it? Us. You and I, my friend. You know it well. But I'm out of the game now. You're the only one left playing. It will be a tough game. Let's say you challenge the authenticity of Meme Moro's not and the findings prove you right. To stop you they'll offer you Ignazio, the delegate's brother. Spampinato will rebel. And the delegate is a dead man. If you can carry on and by some miracle you are not transferred elsewhere maybe you can get to lawyer Fasulo. If you are able to frame him for the murder of father Carnazza maybe they'll sacrifice Fasulo. So you, having apparently won the game, will have actually lost. - Lost? What do you mean? - Yes. To make it clear. Let's say my investigation on Coco Afflitto is called "File A" and yours on father Carnazza is "File B". We become strong only if File A and File B become a single investigation. But don Coco Afflitto keeps getting rid of his right hand So he keeps our two investigations separate, and comes out clean. - So it's pointless to move forward - No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that at worst we risk reaching a partial truth. It's always better than no truth! Come with me. I have just received an order for immediate release. Mr. Bovara, are you not happy? I knew it. I moved the horse and won the game. (Knock at the door) Who is it? - Caminiti, what a pleasure! - Good evening. - Come in. - How nice to see you! They told me you had been released. - Yes. I imagined you'd come to the hotel. So I thought I'd get you a shirt, a sweater underwear and a suit from my son who is almost your size. You can wear them immediately, it's all been washed. Thank you! I said you were looking for trouble What's important is that it's all been sorted. - I'll let you rest. - Goodbye - Is the bed comfortable? - It's comfortable. - I can get you a different room. - No. - Then I'll go. Good night. Stellino. How are you? You see I came back? Do you want to go for a walk? < Only at this time, at night does there seem to be peace in this village. < All that tangle of greed, arrogance cruelty, connivance seems to doze off at a certain hour < It's like evil and rot also get tired. < Sleeps Don Coco Afflitto. < Maybe he's dreaming of having more money and power or having to defend what he already has from those who want to steal it < Sleeps Lawyer Fasulo, and maybe he only has nightmares because his next misstep, he knows, the gunshot will be aimed at him. < And sleeps he who sheds blood on their account. < Maybe he dreams about not being a savage beast but to finally be at the top of the pyramid higher than anyone else, and living like a king. < Sleeps donna Teresina, too. < She dreams that her breath becomes light, light and the breath between her lips becomes a sort of sweet music. < The song of an angel. < And so sleeping, she returns to innocence.
