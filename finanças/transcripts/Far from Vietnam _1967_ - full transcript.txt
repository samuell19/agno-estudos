You can hold it upside down. (American national anthem playing) (yelling) (whistling) - [Voiceover] I saw a new western Europe, that has achieved an unprecedented degree of well being, prosperity and security, and an increased sense of identity and pride. That Europe, Mr. President, is testimony to the soundness of our policies, past and present. And to the genius and the industry of the people and of the nations of that continent. And gentlemen I can tell you that this was possibly the most rewarding two weeks of political seminar that I've ever had. (trumpeting) (bagpipes playing) (rapid drumming) - [Voiceover] Let's give them all a great hand. They're so nice today to come here in their native costumes to show us that they too are loyal to America. That they are fighting for the same principles that we, here in the United States, fight for. Wake up Tito! Tito is an enemy of the United States. America, the free world depends upon you. Ladies and gentlemen they do deserve a great hand. (upbeat marching music) - [Sailors] One, two. - [Instructor] Do it again. - [Sailors] Three, four. - [Instructor] Repeat it now. - [Sailors] One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four! - A parade is a parade is a parade. (laughing) - [Voiceover] The Telephone Traffic Union of New York. (jaunty music) - This is a parade. A parade is a parade is a parade. (laughing) - [Voiceover] A Vietnam veteran, give him a hand! (cheering) (clapping) Now ladies and gentlemen, there's a group coming along with plenty of sounds. - Give me a V! I! C! T! O! R! Y! Victory! - [Crowd] Victory! Victory! - Victory! - A parade for Vietnam. Support our boys in Vietnam! - They're gonna bury us, and they are burying. Americans, why do you support such individuals? - Come on in folks, join the crowds! Come on in, support our boys in Vietnam! (marching band music) That you vote for the people who are supporting our brothers and sisters, and everybody who's dying! (chanting) - [Crowd] Hey, hey, what do you say? Let's support the USA! Hey, hey, what do you say? Let's support the USA! - We're gonna do it very orderly. Let's all say together the Lord's Prayer for our men in Vietnam. - [Crowd] Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, amen. - [Officer] Thank you very much, please leave in an orderly fashion. Support your local police. (cheering) - It's time for the four o'clock tour to come on, let's go boys. (crosstalk) (shouting) - [Crowd] Big firms get rich, GIs die! Big firms get rich, GIs die! Big firms get rich, GIs die! Big firms get rich, GIs die! Firms get rich, GIs die! Stop the war in Vietnam! Bring the troops home! Stop the war in Vietnam! Bring the troops home! Stop the war in Vietnam! (shouting) - They sacrificed their lives, you bunch of bums! Parading down here, guys are getting killed! Big firms get rich, GIs die! Big firms get rich, GIs die!

Americans should have, by this time, their own image of the war. The real objective of the war is the people. What we have is not a civil war. It is a massive campaign of external aggression from North Vietnam. The Viet Cong is not a legitimate nationalistic movement. It is a movement organized, controlled and supported, by the communist government of North Vietnam. What support it gets from the people in south Vietnam is largely the result of terror, intimidation and murder. One of the regrettable facts of war, any war, is the casualties that are not confined to the military forces involved. There are civilian casualties in Vietnam. And these are of constant concern to me, my commanders and men. But civilian casualties do not result from indiscriminate use of our firepower. They are caused by mechanical failure, or human error. This is in sharp contrast to the Viet Cong policy of calculated attacks on civilians. Never in history of warfare have so many precautions been taken by men in combat. Never has a nation employed its military power with such restraint. I am constantly impressed by the concern for the lives of others shown by the men of my command. They know that they are helping to stop the spread of communism in southeast Asia. And to give the people of South Vietnam a freedom of choice. But they are dismayed and so am I, by recent unpatriotic acts here at home. But I am mindful that the military war in south Vietnam is from the enemy's point of view only part of a protracted and carefully coordinated attack. He does not understand that American democracy is founded on debate, and he sees every protest as evidence of crumbling morale and diminishing resolve. Thus, discouraged by repeated military defeats, but encouraged by what he believes to be popular opposition to our effort in Vietnam, he is determined to continue his aggression from the north. This inevitably will cost lives. The magnificent men and women I command in Vietnam have earned the unified support of the American people, thank you. (applause) (gunfire) (intense music) (slow instrumental music) - To understand what... Happened to Norman that day. Might begin... (child mumbling) Was an article that he was reading, which was reported in a Paris paper. The article was a story about a Catholic priest in south Vietnam who... Had seen his people massacred by United States and south Vietnamese bombs. This was all because Viet Cong had been known to be in the community and had taken refuge in the church at one point. But they were far removed from the village at the time that the airstrike was called on the village in south Vietnam. You want down? - No. - No, no more. This article was extremely moving to Norman. Most everyone knows he went to the Pentagon and... And poured kerosene on himself and used this form of... Of protest. One that the Buddhist monks in south Vietnam had used, I think a few times before. And around supper time, I began to get phone calls telling about what had happened. I didn't know for sure whether he was alive or dead. The exact details of it until I actually went to Fort Meyers infirmary that night. - Roll it. - Okay, you can roll it. Give her a chance, though, let her do it. I had no trouble understanding it at all, because of the kind of person that Norman was. Quite often, at mealtime, we... Would talk about the incongruity of our health and prosperity and our three healthy, lovely children. Contrasting this with the suffering of the people in Vietnam and how difficult it was to know that we were in some way responsible for this. How difficult it was to live with this. Part of what he must've wanted to say was this is how it feels to be burned, as we are burning people, women and children and men every day. I knew that Norman was a kind of person who was willing to make a sacrifice for others if it seemed necessary. To do otherwise would be unbearable. For some people it was an act of affirmation that one person can care that much for humanity, to give his life. I told both of the children what had happened right after they woke up the next morning. I think somehow they probably understood better than the average children would because they knew how Norman felt. Tina said, "Daddy has died, "but now his love has spread." But I know one thing, for absolutely sure. That individual lives have been changed by this. Changed, in some cases dramatically, towards concern for society. And I think it has been worth it. I mean, I think he would say this. A thousand times over. - Love, love, love, love. - Peace, peace, peace, peace. (crowd murmuring) - [Voiceover] Put yourselves in between somebody and the flag, they won't bother you. They're gonna try and get past you, they wanna get to their flag. - Black power makes us proud! Black power makes us proud! Black power makes us proud! - [Voiceover] We need patrolling. And one Captain assigned. (drumming) - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Voiceover] For Uncle Sam? - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Voiceover] Vietnam? - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Voiceover] Are you going? - [Crowd] Hell no! - Are you going? - [Crowd] Hell no! - A little louder! - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Leader] Black people? - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Leader] White People? - [Crowd] Hell no! Black power! Beep beep, bang bang! Oh god, black power! Beep beep, bang bang! Oh god, black power! Beep beep, bang bang. Black power! - You should be ashamed! All of you! What do you want, communism on your front door? I've got moral and legal obligations and you people aren't letting us do it! (mumbling) Go ahead and fight! You make me laugh! How can you do this? You have enough people here to end the war tomorrow! Half of you are kids, you don't know what you want! (crosstalk) - [Crowd] We want peace! We want peace! We want peace! (heckling) - Let your voices be heard against north Vietnamese aggression. Against rule by terror! The United States is not a nation of aggressors, of murderers! You know it in your hearts, every one of you knows it! If the north Vietnamese come to the conference table tomorrow morning, the war ends tomorrow morning! Don't protest only against America! * Come by here * We are brothers, Lord * Come by here * Oh Lord, come by here * From every mountain top * Let freedom ring (cheering) - America! (yelling) * And crown thy good * With brotherhood * From sea to shining sea (yelling) (chanting) - Peace, please, peace, please! Peace, please! - Peace, peace! Peace! (screaming) Please, peace! Peace, please! Peace, please! - [Crowd] Peace now, peace now! Peace now, peace now, peace now! (shouting) - [Crowd] Bring the troops home! End the war in Vietnam, bring the troops home! - Down with the Viet Cong, down with Hanoi! - Stick it up your ass! (shouting) - [Crowd] Peace, peace, peace! Hey hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today? - [Leader] Vietnam? - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Leader] Are you going? - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Leader] Are you going? - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Leader] A little louder! - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Leader] A little louder! - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Leader] Are you going? - [Crowd] Hell no! - The history does not ask, how many people were there? The history ask, was this the greatest mass demonstration in the American territory, anywhere in the world, against the war? And the answer will be, yes! - The whole issue is between the power structure of the western world. With the police, the whole entire world, with white supremacy, of nationalism! No black man should go because it is a genocide against the history of the black peoples in America. We are tired of fighting history! - I am for killing the Vietnamese people when they come here! - [Man] That's right! - But they're fighting for liberation, independence, democracy, neutrality and peace! And the Viet Cong are never gonna surrender! They're never gonna give their country away! - America number one is responsible for all the trouble in the world! The late President Kennedy said in his state visit to Brazil, he said, it is not the communists in the world that creates trouble, it is the capitalist pimps themselves who create trouble! - That's right, that's right. (crosstalk) - If the rich man would go, he's not going nowhere! He wants you to go! You're the fool, you're the sufferers, man! Do you understand me? (crosstalk) You understanding me? That he tell you, you can't do this, and you can't do that. Why? There hasn't been the fighting then. If I can fight, I can do what I want inside America! (crosstalk) And they said nonviolent, they said peace, peace, peace. But they're going to another country and fight, for what? America is violent, very violent. - You go and you die over there! Why, what is the reason? What kind of war is that over there in Vietnam? Do you agree about that war over there? The world is against that war. - In other words, you're saying, that you would not fight for your country if you had to? You would not fight? You don't realize, but the north Vietnamese are not the ones we are fighting. The ones we are fighting are communists. I don't see why anybody in the United States should sit here and stand by and demonstrate and everything else until they went and fight for their country. - 500,000 peace marchers! And you called them communists! The south Vietnamese, they are fighting with the American troops, the Americans are no more sure... (crosstalk) - You know the Indian's old expression? (mumbling) Somebody has to do the job, Johnny! - No Mister! We don't need dirty job! We need to do the clean job, not dirty job! - Well if them cats were over here, from Vietnam, you wouldn't be here. (crosstalk) How long you been in this country? How long ya been in this country? How long ya been in this country? - Don't shout at me, Mister. As gentleman, you can debate with me. - Debate? - You could learn something. - Learn something? Don't put your hands on this suit I paid for! - But I see that you are already-- - Yeah, I'm a hothead! (crosstalk) How long you been in this country? - This morning. The first day! - You don't like it, go back. Then go back. - But I go back, do you go back from Vietnam? I go back! - I was in Vietnam. (crosstalk) (singing) (chanting) - It's wrong to kill. - [Woman] No it's not! - Is it right to kill? - So my kids don't get killed, yes. - What's so special about your kids than any other kid in the world? - They're mine. (crosstalk) - You wanna see your kid happy, destroy the rest of the kids in the world? - Survival is for the fittest. - [Man] That's a selfish mother! - If you were in Hanoi, all of you would be executed. I was China in 1944! - Mister, mister. (crosstalk) - You read the papers lately? My country, right or wrong, it's my country. - [Man] Finish the other half of it! And if she be wrong, by God, let me make it right! - Can I ask you a question? Who's right and who's wrong now? - [Man] Who's right? - [Woman] The Viet Cong right? The Russians right, or are we? Who's right or wrong, I'm asking you a question. I just want an answer to it. - [Man] If it's, regardless of who kills, it's wrong. And who starts a war, it's wrong. - Yeah, but who's right and wrong right now? - [Man] If you have to kill to defend yourself, then you're right. - You're not answering my question. Who's right and who's wrong? - [Man] The United States is wrong. - Oh, and the others are right? - [Man] Because of one thing. - It's only by an act of congress that you're standing here alive! - [Man] Come on, don't walk away now. Listen to my point. - Are you kidding me? We're wrong? - Every day people are dying in Vietnam, we stand around here like a bunch of idiots! You don't know what a bomb is, do you? None of you know what a bomb is! I'll show you what a bomb is! This is a bomb! - Heaven and Earth shall perish away! But not one word shall pass, he says. According to that constant judgement! The judgement is at hand! Jesus is coming soon! (murmuring) (vocalizing) - Napalm. Napalm! Napalm! (yelling) Napalm! Napalm! (vocalizing) Napalm! (crosstalk) - [Older man] Oh, I get it now. - Napalm. - Vietnam! (vocalizing) What does napalm mean? - [Protester] Napalm. - [Cameraman] Nobody knows what Napalm is? - No, I don't. - Is that the fire? - Napalm, that's what it means? - Napalm, napalm. - No, what is it? - Napalm is jellied gasoline. It's being used in Vietnam to burn up people and villages, it clings to people's-- - What is napalm? - Well napalm is jellied gasoline. Jelly gasoline, the napalm is. (crosstalk) - Do you know what napalm is? - [Soldier] Napalm? - It's kids like this that are getting burned up by napalm. Kids like this, and this woman. All people, like you, grown up people. They're being burned up for no good reason at all. It isn't even helping anything that anyone could want. That's why if they, they don't stop this war, there won't be any... (explosions) (gunfire) - [Voiceover] Hey, I'm Superman! - [Voiceover] We gotta go home! - [Voiceover] Look at that! (crosstalk) - We're in Vietnam, fighting the war! (mouthing gunfire sounds) (yelling) (mumbling) - Scream. Go ahead, scream. (grunting) (yelling) - I was delighted to learn that the MiG airfields had been bombed. At least two of them today. (applause) (crosstalk) - [Paperman] Paper tells you all about it! (dramatic music) (gunfire) - I Was just try... - [Voiceover] Yes, it's a dirty world. So even the smallest scratch can get infected. See why you need a Band-aid sheer strip? It keeps dirt out and lets healing air in. So protect every scratch with a Band-aid sheer strip. - [Voiceover] Ready, aim, press the button. And 60 seconds later, it's like opening a present. - [Voiceover] Carmichael repeated his call for resistance for the war in Vietnam. - You're talking about you don't want to be bothered, and the honky gonna snatch you up, and send you to Vietnam to shoot people. And you come back and say, "Yeah, we don't believe in violence. "It's all right to shoot yellow people. "It's all right to shoot everybody else, "but Lord, don't shoot this honky!" (applause) You have to recognize what they talk about! Lyndon Baines Johnson can't tell you that violence never accomplishes anything! If the honky believes it, tell 'em to use nonviolence in Vietnam! (cheering) - [Voiceover] It's gonna be a question of putting maximum pressure on the enemy. We'll have to grind him down. In effect, we're fighting a war of attrition. And the only alternative is a war of annihilation, which I think we've ruled out as a matter of policy. So the end is not in sight. We must be prepared for bitter fighting in the days to come. - And leave the driving to us. (crosstalk) - [Voiceover] On the rocks. - Now I use Shake n Bake. - It is true that over here, the Americans, many of them say, better dead than red. They don't mean that, believe me. These people wanna live. They don't mind fighting that war as long as it's 10,000 miles away. The worst thing that could happen to the American morale would be some damage to a city on its own shores. The Americans do not know what it's like to live under bombardment. They feel very happy waging a war 10,000 miles from its own shore. The war that the United States is waging now is the war to suppress revolutionary movements everywhere. - [Voiceover] At 100 miles an hour. (mumbling) - [Voiceover] Helena sweetheart, we love you and so happy you enjoyed the country music show! - [Voiceover] Got a big day coming up. (sirens wailing) - [Voiceover] We can win the war in Vietnam. (yelling) - [Voiceover] Racing begins at 2 pm! (solemn music) (explosions) (suspenseful music) (clanging)
