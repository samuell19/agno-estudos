One Thing at a Time When's it our turn? In 15 minutes, all being well. - Whoa, I ain't no dog! - Stop it! Calm down! You're hurting me! Hey, you want my picture? What are you doing here? You know, paperwork. - For your residences? - Our estate. So, what are you working on? Terrorism, financial scandal? Cut the bullshit. Two-bit divorce cases, as usual. When it's not "one-bit". You don't even charge some of them. A concept you're not familiar with. Us little lawyers know what altruism is. Big lawyers know that, too. Like Leonardi. - So I hear. - You'll be able to ask him. - Who? - Leonardi. - Why? He's here? - He's coming over on Saturday. - I wanted to surprise you. - Surprise me? Well... We've become friends. He's coming to the estate for a little party. - Really? - Yes. You have to be there, of course. That's very nice of you! I've been dying to meet him. Come with your wife. I don't think so. She doesn't like you. - She doesn't like anyone. - Sorry, I have to go. I don't know what's wrong. He's very nervous. I'll take care of it, madam. - Will you ride again later? - No, not today. I'll paint in my studio. Tell Emilie to bring me some tea. Yes, madam. You kiss that crook on the cheek? Are you his lawyer? No, I'm his friend. A childhood friend. A real friend. Maybe his only friend, too. - Why do you call him a crook? - Everybody knows he is. I've even seen his name on television, and all... His properties, shady deals... He's a real estate broker. He married his wife because he wanted the Castelmaure estate. Didn't he? I don't understand what she sees in him. In the meantime, she's not getting a divorce, but you are. Come on! Did you go to China for the tea? Mr. Demange was hungry. - I thought... - I don't pay you to think. Yes, madam. And button up your shirt. Right. Hello? Stop messing with other men's wives. Just stop! I won't let you get away with it, you hear me? You might not see your wife again! - Congrats on your case. - News travels fast. I've already had two threatening calls. Me too. In fact, I won't be answering my work phone anymore. I'll give it to you once a day. Keep work-related messages only. I'll delete the others. Make a copy of them first. There are lunatics out there. - I'll do that now. - No. First, get two glasses and a bottle of champagne, and come to my office. Are we celebrating the divorce? No, we're celebrating my first meeting on Saturday with none other than Mr. Leonardi. - Really? - Yes. There's a dinner party at Castelmaure and I'm invited. You know what they say, "He's the best criminal lawyer in France, "the terror of the Bar". Don't call him that. You know he hates it. Even if he offered me a job, I'd still prefer to work for you. You believe in me? Absolutely. Like you believe in yourself. You know my motto. Yes, I do. "One thing at a time". And one after the other. Well, cheers! And to me. Na zdorovie! It's an honor to host you in my home. It's an honor for us. Christine, my wife. - The property owner. - My respects, madam. I'll introduce you to my friends. They're quite polite. - They won't ask you for a selfie. - I hope they don't. Dr. Géraud and Mylène, his wife. - Hello. - Hello, sir. I can fall sick then! Just don't get sick tonight. Hermine and Bruno de Laissac, the owners of the golf course. Hello, madam. Sir. If you wish... No. My favorite sport is napping. Excellent! Have a canapé. For your nap. You're putting on a show! I know, it's a bad joke, but I'm just starting. We'll eat soon. I hope you're hungry. Very. - Who's that? - Oh, silly me! I almost forgot. He's excited about meeting you. Julien Lefort. A childhood friend. We grew up in the same foster family. I didn't do well, but he became a lawyer. A little lawyer. Just a little lawyer. There's no such thing. Justice will always be a great cause, right? So, the big lawyer? Just like on TV. Impressive. Looks like a good eater. He's going to be pleased. The partridge was delicious. And the wine, exquisite. Our best, from the time we had a vineyard. Thank God my husband didn't sell everything to buy expensive cars to show off in. I've a soft spot for cars. She loves jewels. To each their own. What do you like, Pierre? I like paintings. That one's beautiful. Who's the painter? That'd be me. Christine has a studio in the back. It's her secret garden. No husbands allowed. It's also been my bedroom lately. I guess still life is my thing... She's an artist! Things will soon get out of hand. - The old bag's drunk. - Don't say that, or... - Or what? - You're gonna get fired. I know someone should leave, and it's not me... You think it's me? No, Mommy. I think it's Picasso. Picasso... You truly have no respect. That's right. Young people nowadays... They just have no respect. Hey, take it easy. To each their vice. You like whores, I like wine. So, Julien... Why didn't you aim for a high-flyer career like Mr. Leonardi? - "High-flyer"? - Yes. That's for eagles. I'm just a sparrow. I like small cases. Leaves me time for fishing. Plus, all that media exposure must be hard to manage. However, I remember one time on TV... Pierre, tell us who you met on your way to Rio. - It was great. - We met on the plane. I believe Jacques was going to close a deal in Manaus. - And I... - No, no... He wanted to import some Brazilian girls. My husband loves Brazilian girls. He makes houses for Brazilian people... especially Brazilian women. Let the samba begin! Here's to you and to Corcovado. That's enough now! Ladies and gentlemen... I am leaving. Please accept my apologies. I've had too many drinks, and might say stupid things. Goodnight. Go to the living-room. I will join you in a moment. She's been a bit tired lately. It happens to me, too, even when I'm not tired. Na zdorovie. Goodnight. Christine. Christine! Christine. This is the last time you embarrass me. Let go! Oh, really? Look. I was afraid you'd already left. Not before saying goodbye. Sorry about my wife. She's depressed. Alcohol and pills don't go well together. A good game of golf tomorrow and... No, horse riding's her thing. Sometimes, she even goes to the manege at night. It calms her down. She'll be fine. And I'll be in bed. - Do you want to stay? - No. I have to get going. I'm working on a child-murder and torture case. You defend the murderer? Why do you ask that? There's right to counsel. Otherwise, we'd be the savages. You are absolutely right, my dear colleague. It was nice to meet you. - I hope I see you again. - Same here. You must be a very good lawyer. I know you are. You have to believe it yourself. I'm working on it. Goodbye, Jacques. Thank you, Pierre. See you soon. He really is the best. In this job, you end up meeting someone better than you sooner or later. Although that doesn't make you a bad lawyer. Can I take it? Yes. Everything that's mine is yours. Everything? Well, almost. I'll make do with this. Just this. All right, bye. Unknown number Already home? You didn't hang out with one of your divorcees? The estate crook had no plans with his fuck buddy? How dare you. He's not... He's not a crook. He's not? I don't sell shoeboxes to old folks. I wipe their asses till 2 in the morning. You were due to finish at 11. Where were you? What do you care? You do what you want, I come home when I want. What about the other guy? The big lawyer. Did he give you a few tips for success? Did you tell him that, despite the robe, you had a shitty life? A shitty life? In a 300-square meter apartment? 20 km away from here, there are people living in 30 m2 with 6 kids. Six kids? I would've been happy with just one. To give him what? A lousy future? Remember, Clebs, what Coluche used to say? "There are people who have kids because they can't have a dog". Come on, give Daddy a kiss. Are you coming to bed? I am in bed. I think the best thing God has done, is not giving speech to animals. All right... A little nap, and then we're off fishing. In the manege. Thank you. Hey! Who are you? Lawyer Lefort. Sorry, I'm wearing my fishing outfit. I'm a friend. - Please, go ahead. - Just watch me! What happened? She fell. Her head... She probably broke her neck. I'm here. Remember? Yeah... It was there. - I'm going to marry her. - No, I will. - No, I will! - I will! Why her? It was fate. As I always say, "Go where you want, die where you must". Shall we take her to your room or her room? My room. I mean, our room. I'm not wearing a seatbelt, I know. It's the car model. What year is it? Are you interested? 1968. "Under the stone is the beach". "It is forbidden to forbid". "CRS, SS." Forget it, you weren't even born then. No... But I've been told. I'm Captain Clément. I arrived 2 weeks ago. I don't know everyone yet. You and Mr. Demange seem to be pretty close. We are. I might need you later. What for? This accident seems fishy. - What makes you think that? - My gut, probably. Your "gut"? What are you, The Mentalist? He's like you. He's not particularly fond of cops. It's just I didn't make the introductions. Clebs, this is Captain Clément "Patrick Jane", Los Angeles Police Department. Nice to meet you, Clebs. You know the saying - "Talk to my ass, my head's sick". In my case, my wife is sick, so I talk to my dog. Not while driving. I put it on vibrate. Thank you. Excuse me for a second. Why don't you come with me? Come to the house. We'll have a talk. - We don't want to. - You're at home. Not yet, but we will be soon, you bastard! This is no time to insult me. What about our mother? Did you hold your insults back? Did you? You damn bastard! You didn't mind, you asshole! Kids, please stop. Stop. Not now. Just not now. - Hello, sir. - Hello. - Madam. - Hello. Agathe, my secretary. Is there a problem? An argument with the children. I mean, her children. Her first husband died 15 years ago. - And now it's war. - To say the least. It's war even when no money's involved, so... Could you come see me later? As a friend. As a friend? At the police station? No, at my club. It's more discreet. - You do this? - Yes. Precision, concentration, efficiency. You see? Get away from death, and the sun comes out. It was a nice funeral, nonetheless. Is there such thing as "a nice funeral"? Unless the deceased opens the casket and says, "Hi! I was just kidding". I'm sorry. I don't want to bother you, but I stored your messages. Two of them are rather strange. Work messages? No, but... I said, "work messages only". - Yes, but... - Do you trust me? Yes. Do you really trust me? Yes. Now keep your eyes on the road. Then we'll do as I said. This isn't a good time. How much? That's great. Tell him I'll call in 10 minutes. Why did you stop? I need some quiet to ask you a delicate question. Are you in love with me, Agathe? I think so. That's what I thought. I'm no prince charming, though. No. Princes no longer exist. But there are still charming people. No. You're right. One thing at a time. Can we be on more familiar terms? No. Julien, one thing at a time. Eyes on the road. "Eyes on the road". Cops play cowboys, not Indians. I prefer the Indians. They're smarter. I rarely miss my target. A few pieces of my murder puzzle are missing. Your murder puzzle? You want to lock the horse away? I would like to know more about the relationship between Mrs. Demange and her husband. Did he love her? Oh, yes he did! Even though he'd have fun elsewhere, he really loved her. Since forever. She was an amazing woman, you know. Just amazing. What do you think of this? "It wasn't an accident. "Her scombag husband killed her. Keep looking". "Scombag" with an "O". Probably just a sad case. Many people hated him. Don't attach importance to it. Something's not right. Look at these photos. I'm not interested. I'm sorry. Just take a close look. There. I zoomed it in. Look at her boots. Easy, easy... Horses see to the sides. If you want to look him in the eye, move. I've done horseback riding. The spurs are backwards. That's weird for a regular. Almost impossible, I'd say. Also... Look at her arms. There're scratches. Plus the bruises on her face that seem out of proportion. She was hit, if you ask me. Maybe it was the horse. Yes, maybe. In any event, there will be an investigation at the estate. What do you think? - Honestly? - Yes, honestly. He killed her during a fight, accidentally or not, and he made it look like a riding accident. The atmosphere was tense that night. Yes, I was there. However... Will you defend him if he's accused? If he wants me to. - Can I be there tomorrow? - Absolutely. Despite your friendship, you'll be unbiased. I've heard good things about you. And bad things about him. No, it's the other way round. That goddamn cop has no respect. You know I didn't do it. Of course. Did you argue after we left? Well, yes. I went to the studio. Things got heated. We scuffled, I ripped one of her paintings, she slapped me... The usual. But that's it. - That's it? - Yes. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Then, I went back to my bedroom. We had separate rooms. Yeah, that's what I heard. I wanted to say goodbye. That'll be all for today. - Are you coming back? - Perhaps, yes. What happened to your hand? I don't know. But this whole thing is outrageous, you... You, what? Nothing, nothing. You think I killed her for this estate? I already have it! Calm down! Yes, we used to argue a lot. We even argued that night, and things got ugly. I can be tough with my words, but never with my actions. Never. I swear, Captain. See? He swears. - You still work with that Perez guy? - He's good. He'd have screwed us last time if it hadn't been for me. We ended up screwing him, though. I hope he paid his dues, because he's got a lot of debts. How's the investigation going? The cop thinks he's Columbo. I didn't do anything! Two champagnes. And tea for my wife. Better avoid the champagne. She might fall off her horse. What did you say, asshole? I'm ordering. Relax. People here have good manners. Are you insane? Calm down, Jacques. Calm down. That son of a bitch! You said you weren't tough in your actions. He insulted him. Doesn't matter. It's an extra element. For what? Sir, we found traces of blood belonging to your wife on the seats of her cart and in her studio. Someone tried to get rid of them, but luminol doesn't lie. Given all the rest, the situation seems clear. What situation? You had an argument, you killed her. Deliberately or not. You dressed her sloppily, took her body to the manege, and left it there to make it look like she'd fallen. Then you took the horse back, a horse she didn't get to ride. You're out of your mind. Or not. At any rate, that's my firm conviction. The investigating judge will see to the rest. There'll probably be an exhumation and autopsy. - I'm going to... - Let it go. - Come on. - You're free to go. You see murders everywhere. It was an accident. Just an accident. Real estate agent Jacques Demange is under investigation and on remand for the murder of his wife. He allegedly killed her during an argument, and covered up the murder... This is your chance to become famous. You will defend your friend. We'll see. Unless he thinks you're crap, like he always has. Yes, he better choose Leonardi. With you, he risks life. - He's innocent. - Yeah, right. Mind you, he was right. She wasn't really worth much. - Respect her memory. - Her memory or your memory? She gave you a hard time. You wanted that estate. But no. Once again, showy Jacques stole your spot. You probably married me out of spite. Stop. Either way, you're so dumb she'd have cheated on you with him. Stop it right now! Shut up! What? Want to hit me? You? The pacifist? Hey, "peace and love". "Let the sun shine". It's the first time. All in good time. See? When pushed to the limit, anyone can do anything. Even you. I'm not just anyone. And you've got no balls. If you had any, you'd be long gone. Cheers to you, bitch! All right? Could be better. It's not easy, you know. - You won't stay long. - You bet. I didn't do anything. I know you didn't do anything. But there's quite a lot of evidence pointing at you. - Assumptions. - Of course. What's that money business for a project in Brazil? How do you know about that? The house staff. I'll be firing some of them. In the meantime, they talk. You're smoking again? Losing someone can be hard, you know. Yes, I know what it's like. You got pretty loud that night. Christine started shouting that she wouldn't give you a dime to get you out of trouble. What was it? I miscalculated, but I'll figure it out. You'll have to tell me more if you want me to prepare... I've been thinking about it. I'm sorry, you won't be my lawyer. My life's at stake. This isn't a divorce trial. So... I called Leonardi, and he agreed to defend me. I was expecting this. - Are you mad at me? - No. Keep it. Even in the name of this? Well played, Mr. Lefort. Friendship, loyalty, memories... But that won't be enough. Don't give me that look. I'm not being ungrateful, I'm just being cautious. So? It won't be us. Are you disappointed? No, I was expecting it. But let's keep our chins up. Champagne! To celebrate what? To celebrate us. Want to come to Relais du Moulin tonight? To have dinner? To fuck. We'll have dinner later. Is that a problem? Well... yes. Too bad. You can't say I didn't try. I'm sorry. Is dinner mandatory? After sex, the first that speaks says something stupid. You just said it. Well, I'm going to say another one. Did you like it? Not bad. And you? You bet. I've been dreaming about it forever! Can we do it again? Of course! We'll have to be discreet, though. That'll make two secrets. Why two? Because I think I got it. You got what? What everyone will soon understand. That you are a wonderful man, and you deserve way better. Want to go eat? No! Let's do it again, then we'll eat. All right, but first... There's something important I need to tell you. - I lied to you. - About what? Well, I told you we'd fuck, and we ended up making love. I'm sorry. Fucking would've been much better. Today's the first day of a long-awaited trial, a high-profile case given the character of the defendant and his lawyer, Mr. Leonardi. The accused has never ceased to proclaim his innocence. Let's listen to what Mr. Leonardi had to say. He's only being prosecuted because of the jealousy of people. They wanted to make their fantasies come true. The truth will come to light. Let's go back to the portrait of the defendant, a businessman... You see, if you weren't such a loser, you'd be on TV. I've better things to do. A little divorce? No. Not a little divorce. A big one. Our divorce. That's right, my good old Anne-Marie. I've found another woman. She's younger. She's prettier. She's... I've something better than that. Take it. Come on! Go ahead. Be my guest. Who's got no balls now? Come on, Clebs! We're free. The Court. You can be seated. Isn't this nice? He said I looked like you... I don't think so. The eyes, maybe. The eyes. Did Mrs. Demange ride that horse regularly? All the time. It was her favorite. You think it could've thrown her off? No! It's a docile horse. May I remind you that the lady was heavily drunk. - I wasn't there that night. - Well, I was. Mr. Mariani, you're Mr. Demange's associate. The investigation shows you needed a big sum of money for a project in Brazil. Is that correct? Yes, but Jacques was about to find a solution. What solution? I don't know, but he always found one. And since he was his wife's heir, he soon came up with one. What you're saying is horrible, but it doesn't surprise me coming from you. You remain true to your guiding principles. Was there any shouting? It was usual. - Struggling noises? - Maybe. No more questions. Do you happen to listen at the door, madam? Never! Look at the Court, please. You have a sharp ear. I believe there's quite some distance between your room and Mrs. Demange's studio. I was passing by. You were passing by. Is Emilie your daughter? Yes, why? No reason. Did you ever witness any act of violence between the spouses? No. To the Court. It depends on what you mean by that. I'm talking about physical violence, blows. No fights, ever. They're temperamental. They'd yell, but that's it. He's a violent man! He hit my husband at the club. He's a thug! I'm warning you! - Take her out, please. - I'm telling you, he's a thug! You need to know! Order, please. - Order! - Let go of me. It'll be OK. The hearing's adjourned. We will resume tomorrow at 9 AM. - It's going to be fine. - Thank you. Excuse me, may I? You know me. Lefort! Sit down. I'll call you back. - Sit down, please. - I'm just checking in. So, how did it go? Weren't you in the courtroom? No, it's too... painful for me. Because I took your place? No, no. It's because of Christine. I liked her very much, so hearing all the details when I don't have to... I understand. What's Silbert like? Silbert is young, tough and unpredictable. Jacques is innocent anyway, and there's no way you'll lose. We'll see. What was your first name again? Julien. You know, Julien, a criminal court is like a lottery game. The jury can change their mind at any time. Over a word, a gesture, an attitude... Essentially... we're all tightrope walkers. Thanks for the lesson. It's just the way it is. And tomorrow? The experts. It's going to be a tough day, even if they talk nonsense... Why don't you order some fries? I'm not that hungry. I'll just have these. The coroner's demonstration is quite clear. Blow marks on her face. A broken bone, not necessarily caused by a fall. The horse may have stepped on the victim. It's compatible with the bruises you observed. What about the scratches on the husband? Mr. Demange, please answer him. We kind of struggled in her room, that's true. But we've all had heated arguments with our spouses. Sorry, it's never happened to me. If you say so. Anyhow, I didn't hit her. She was perfectly fine when I left. She said she was going to ride. - Fishing everyday? - For as long as the trial lasts. Anything important? Yes. I love you. Me neither. Jealous! What are you doing here? I'm getting a divorce. Is this the place? What do you like about him? Everything you don't like. He doesn't want to be successful. He's living in the wrong era. And that's good. I'm living in his era. Be careful. I'm living in my era. And in my era, we're capable of anything. Is that a threat? What do you think, bitch? That you're the first? I've always managed to keep him. I may not be the first, but I will be the last. I confirm that Mrs. Demange's blood was found in her bathroom and her cart. The blood stains were wiped off. What else do you need? It's crystal clear. The word of experts is final. It's simple: He killed her and drove her to the manege. She never got on that horse. The blood stains are incontrovertible evidence. That's a bit hasty. You're going too fast. The stains don't prove anything. Blood stains aren't necessarily proof of murder, just like a stain of sperm is no proof of rape. That's not exactly a delicate image. You can do better, you're off-topic. We're very much on topic! Madam, the family doctor says Mrs. Castelmaure Demange was hemophiliac, which is usually a male disease. That's why you didn't investigate that possibility, despite being an expert. I wonder... Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is it that odd that the blood of this woman was found in her car? Is it that odd that her blood was found in her bathroom? In every one of her living spaces? In particular, madam, after the emotional shock of the argument? Well? How was it? Leonardi's in great shape. Yeah, as usual. Did she often put her spurs on backwards? Never. Mrs. Demange was an experienced horse rider. Does the prosecution have any questions? No questions, Your Honor. - The defense? - Yes. Thank you, Your Honor. Can a drunk person put her spurs backwards even if she's a good rider? Maybe, but I don't think she would. Tell me, you really liked Mrs. Demange, didn't you? - Oh, yes! - Oh, yes! What about Mr. Demange? Likewise. Oh, no! If you felt the same, you'd have said "oh, yes" with the same enthusiasm. That Leonardi guy is impressive. But evidence is evidence, and it's all against him. Demange is arrogant. - He's a jerk. - That doesn't make him guilty. - No, but it helps. - That's true. Come in. You want some? No? That's too bad. I guess this is what I must say. You don't talk much. 5th day of the Demange trial. Despite Leonardi's efforts, the prosecution is ahead. The judge seems annoyed by the defendant, who appears to be indifferent. However, it's all but over. People are even making bets. Such behavior illustrates total disregard for the family. And cut! How was it? Perfect. It airs tonight at 7 PM. How much do you bet? 100 euros, guilty. I think he's innocent. Deal? Deal. I'm sure he's guilty. The accusation is based on the assumption that he killed her and moved her. I want to prove that she rode that horse. Good. Can you find any evidence of that? I'll try to. It'd be terrible to sentence an innocent. For the jury, yes. And for you? - Even worse. - You have a really nasty job. You won't answer? Answer what? A dumb question usually gets a dumb answer. Eat, or it'll get cold. The mash must be good here. - Want to dip in your finger? - That'd be too much. Hello? Yes, that's me. Yes, tell me where. - OK. - Is there a problem? More like a solution. - I'll see you in court. - OK. Proof of Mr. Demange's guilt is more than sufficient. However, could we please hear the testimony of a witness? Of course. - A material witness? - No, a character witness. Please bring in Mrs. Jeanne Bornard. This doesn't look good. And in a wheelchair, what's more. Unbelievable. Demange's ex, in a wheelchair. She jumped out of a window after he'd dumped her. That's what she said at the time. He doesn't stand a chance. Actually, I didn't jump out of a window. We argued. - He pushed me out. - That's not true! Please, let her finish. No, she's lying! Let her talk. If you don't, it'll be worse. It's a trap. - Go ahead. - Why didn't you say anything? He said he'd take it out on my kid. - Is it his? - No, mine. From a previous relationship. He didn't even come to see me in hospital. Why did you wait so long to speak out? He won't be able to hurt me from prison. Now everybody knows he's a murderer. Bravo! - Anything to add? - Yes. Your witness... Your witness exudes honesty but she's short of breath. After this moment of fake emotion, this bouquet of lies, I have a question. It isn't for your witness but for you, Your Honor. How long until lunch? The court will now recess. Dramatic twist at the Demange trial. A woman's testimony has seriously damaged the image of the defendant. Despite Leonardi's attempts to play down this new element, he will have a hard time convincing the jury... Demange is done for. He's not. He has Leonardi. There's the blood, the bruises, the spurs. Everything you'd need. Are they proof? No. Suppositions. The arguments of the prosecution can be refuted. Seriously refuted. Effectively refuted. The hemophilia, the stomp of the agitated horse, the fall, the drunkenness. So what's the last resort, ladies and gentlemen? Witnesses. Witnesses who came as quick as bunnies. The stable lad, who doesn't like Jacques Demange. The cook, who hates him because of his relationship with her daughter. That's not true! Sit down and be quiet. Madam, these are all proven facts. And the icing on the cake. The disabled witness that came out of nowhere, with her shaky voice, who we should take at her word, my dear colleague. And what does she tell us? Things that have nothing to do with why my client's here. He's not here because a cynical old lady decided to come and lie. He's here because he's charged with murder. Ah... Ah, that suits you fine. You'd like him to be guilty. I can see it in your eyes. What a paradox! We all want to succeed, and we hate those who have. And Jacques succeeded. That's what make us weak. We know jealousy, we know envy. We envy the strong, the handsome, the rich. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen, nothing can justify - and certainly not that - that we send, not even for one day or one hour, an innocent man to prison. Yes, I saw that. They're biting. But I'm not sure they'll get hooked. Finally, Jacques, you're not going to like this. You're rich, you're smart. You're the definition of judicial error. Ladies and gentlemen, look him in the eye. It's the least you can do, since you'll be sealing his fate. Christine fell off the horse because she was drunk. Because she was upset. Your Honor, gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you find Jacques Demange guilty, you will be committing... a judicial murder. The hearing is now over. We should sit down and review the Bernardi case. There's a couple of things to clarify. Excellent, as usual. But he'll be found guilty. You just forgot to tell him not to smile at the end. - A last cigarette? - Little jerk! I'll take that as a compliment. Demange has been sentenced to 15 years. His lawyers have already said they'll appeal. OK, good. It airs in one hour. Here. Your 100 euros. - Well? - Yes, you were right. Will you keep your lawyer? Yes, I guess. You don't change a losing team, right? Julien... I know you're dying to, but... You think you could do better? I would do my best. I know you're innocent. The others are already working on a new case. But I can only think about yours. Besides, I've already proved that you could trust me. Haven't I? - The estate's nice. - Yeah. Shall we go see? Are you mad? There're dogs. You have to take risks in life. No, stop! Come back! You wanted to see, but someone stole gold cutlery. - That's serious. - It wasn't us. You searched us and didn't find anything. You should be quiet. You are foster children. I will write a report. Sir, who told you we stole the cutlery? The maid. I don't see why you'd care. What if she did it? It's easy to accuse two poor kids. We didn't do anything. We just wanted to see. Believe them. They're good kids. You should be a lawyer. And I'll marry the girl of the house. No. I'll be President of France. She'll marry me. No, me. One thing at a time. You really think you can get me out of here? I'm sure of it. Why? Because I'm sure. I'm good and I want to prove it to you. You're wrong, Julien. I've never underestimated you. Never? Never. I swear. Then maybe I underestimated myself. Yes, maybe. Those who don't succeed blame the others. Then I'll succeed. We'll succeed. Well? We're going to do it. Champagne? I've got better plans. If we win this case, I'll marry you. You need to divorce first. That's my specialty. It'll be wrapped in 2 months. The trial will take place a year from now. Then we'll live in sin for a year. Sin tastes so good. Mr. Lefort, an unknown lawyer, will be representing Mr. Demange. Will he succeed, unlike Mr. Leonardi a year ago? Many people doubt it. Cheers to you, bastard. Did Christine Demange really fall off her horse that night? Ladies and gentlemen, the Court! Be seated. Please bring in the defendant. You said the horse was docile. However, Christine complained about it being nervous a few days before. I don't remember. How about you? I'm not nervous. No, no. Where were you that night? - At home, in town. - Who were you with? No one. - So, no witnesses. - No, since I was alone. That was kind of a dumb question. Not as dumb as your answer. Mr. Mariani, without the money you needed for that business in Brazil, I guess your company would have been in trouble. You all have forgotten to mention that Jacques' fortune was twice as much as his wife's. He had no reason to kill her. Yes, yes he had. With his portion, it'd be 3 times higher. Order! No more questions. Any questions, Mr. Lefort? Mr. Lefort? - No, no. No questions. - Hey! One thing at a time. According to you, could Mrs. Demange have been killed in her room and taken to the manege? - That's very likely. But not certain. No... but it's likely. Were the bruises on her face caused by blows and not a fall? - It is very likely so. - Can the bruises be caused by a horse stamping on her face? It's a possibility, but it's not certain. Can you remind me what the exact name of your profession is? Your Honor! I'm a coroner. "Coroner"... Ah, yes, that is likely! Order! But it's not certain. No more questions. You were surprised by the attitude of the defendant at the scene. When we arrived, he was crying, screaming, and trying to lean over his wife's body to kiss her. - It was a bit over the top. - Oh, no! I can't believe you said that. You, who listen to your "gut" more than anything else. It's an insult to the victim. It's an insult to the system, an insult to them all. It's an insult to France! Did you hear what I said? Did you pay attention to the way I said it? Now that is over the top. Because when you've lost the person you care about most, - and you should know this - you can never go over the top. Hello. Oh... What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. - I thought I'd stop by. - Thanks. Are you mad at me? Why would I be? I took your spot. It's your spot now. Besides, I told you, you're a good lawyer. Don't make me lie. I'll try not to. Do you have a secret weapon? Maybe. Tell him not to smile after the closing address. Consider it done. Do you have any other advice for me? Advice? No, just a thought. If he's found guilty again, think of justice as an administration, not a virtue. A piece of chocolate eclair? No. The last day of a trial with nothing new. The defendant appears less arrogant, but that won't be enough. Only a dramatic turn of events would prevent Mr. Demange from returning to jail. Madam, you decided to speak because the defendant could no longer harm you. Yes. What if you lied? What if you did jump out of that window, and were paid to say you'd been pushed out? What? You're not particularly rich. Well, we investigated and we found 10,000 euros in your account, that appeared, as if by magic, right before your testimony. Come on. Who gave you that money? Who? You did. I did? You looked around, and you decided it'd be me. You came to my house. Me? Look closely. Sure it wasn't a double? It was you... I think. "I think". But you were wearing a red hat and white gloves! Red hat, white gloves, and, why not... an Eiffel Tower tie, while you're at it. Yes! You were wearing an Eiffel Tower tie. Your Honor, apart from the fact that this lady admits to having born false witness in exchange of money, you get an idea of her mental state. No need to continue. I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy... You're crazy! You were eating shrimp! Shrimp? Of course, madam. Yes, I was eating shrimp. I see where the idea comes from, I'm wearing a napkin on my neck. Bring in the sauce! It's funny. It makes them laugh. It would be funny if we weren't talking about an innocent person's life. I'll repeat my question, because I think the answer may be really interesting. Tell me, who gave you that money? No one. No one gave me... This is totally crazy. The chick's totally nuts - she schemes, she lies... It's good for Demange, but it won't be enough. Unless Lefort gives an amazing speech. But he's no near as good as Leonardi. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I was eating out yesterday, and as I was leaving the restaurant, a man threatened me over the money he lost in his divorce case. Just for the record, I never answer my work phone because I don't want to have to deal with that sort of individual. But my secretary stores all the messages. You never know. I decided to listen to them in case that man... Excuse me... I'm sorry, but I don't see the connection... Just wait. I'm getting to it. I listened to the messages, and I stumbled... across one message I didn't know I had. That message was recorded the night of the murder. It's from Christine. Your Honor, could we please listen to that message? - Bailiff, please. - Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, what you are going to hear is the incontrovertible evidence that Mr. Demange is innocent. You will agree with me on the fact that if Christine de Castelamure Demange went riding that night, it was an accident. Unless she was killed at the manege. You've said over and over again that she was killed in her room and that he moved her to simulate an accident. Try not to make anything up when I prove that was impossible. That'd be relentless. Can we listen to that message, please? Julien? This is Christine. Sorry about earlier. I had too much to drink. You know Jacques. He can push people to the limit. See? I would've been better off with you. But I'll be fine. I'm going to ride to calm myself down. Christine had my two phone numbers. She didn't know she was leaving a message on the phone I never use. You all heard her. She said she was going horse riding. But the fact that she said she was going to ride her horse doesn't mean she actually rode it. You are right, Your Honor. You know, it's happened to all of us. You, me, certain people... We dial a number and then we hang up. We put the phone in our pocket, and a few minutes later, we make an abrupt gesture, and the phone turns on. Sometimes, it calls the last number that we dialed. And that's what happened. I'd like us to listen to the message I got a few minutes later. 22 minutes. 22 minutes passed between the two calls. Enough time for Christine to argue with Jacques, which he didn't deny, go to the manege, take her horse, ride it for a while and fall off it accidentally, as you all heard. All of you. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I won't be making a long speech. I will be brief. If I were a star lawyer... I'd be dramatic. I'd raise my voice, and look you in the eye. I'd create silences and leave you with your conscience. But I'm not a star lawyer. I'm just a little lawyer who just told you the truth. And brought you the proof. So do what you want. But if you find this man guilty, you will kill him. Because there's no human being that can resist two terrible injustices. The injustice of destiny, that deprives you of the person you love because of an accident that could happen to any of us. And the other injustice, those of the men and women that might sentence him. So do what you want. But if you find him guilty, you'll kill him. You will kill him. And... may I remind you the death penalty was abolished in 1981. Mr. Lefort! You've beaten Leonardi. How do you feel? First of all, I'm very proud I was able to have my client acquitted. As for Mr. Leonardi, he didn't have the conclusive evidence that fate gave me. That's for sure. There'll always be the justice of God. Thank you. One more question, sir... One thing at a time. - Thank you for saving Jacques. - Justice saved him. Justice doesn't decide anything, people do. In fact, I might need your services. A big complaint case. Huh? Yes, sure. With pleasure. Excuse me. Thinking about Christine? Yes, I am. Our wedding here... I know it must be hard, and I'd like to thank you for letting us celebrate here. She's beautiful. Do you really love her or did you just want to get rid of the other one? Get rid of her? I don't know. I don't know yet. I have a present for you. I hope it helps you make up your mind. Thank you. - Surprise! - What is it? Our honeymoon in Brazil, a present from Jacques. You said you'd explain everything the day of our wedding. Whenever you want. Now. They can't wait. That's love! Right? Between you and me, doctor, you think it still works at his age? If it doesn't, he can take pills. You should prescribe some to my husband. I have a better idea. Come to my surgery to collect the prescription. Of course, Eric. Hear that? We're already there. No, no! Later. Where do I start? Well... She was riding the first time we saw her. Both of us. She must have been about 10. You loved her. Yes. As much as he did. Even more, maybe. But he got her. You still love her. - Are you upset? - No. You will always love a true love. And you hate the one who stole it from you. You guessed it. No, I didn't guess. I lived it. A girl stole the man of my life from me. I would've done anything for revenge. Like what? Anything. Well, I didn't do just anything. I thought it out. - At first... - I know. You do? The anonymous letter to the police, that was you. Yes. And you had listened to the messages. I had proof of his innocence and I kept it for myself. I mean, for ourselves. I asked you to store the messages. I knew you'd listen to them. I trusted you. And I'm glad I did. You kept the secret. I didn't know why you were doing it. But I, too, trusted you. You see, making an accident look like murder and then an accident again wasn't an easy thing to do. But it worked. Of course, I added more pain to his sorrow, but a few months in prison for a life of frustration... A low price to pay. "A low price"... Actually, he needed to be sentenced in the first trial so I could defend him later. Then I'd be his savior. And you'd beat Leonardi at the same time. Two birds, one stone. One thing at a time, one after the other. Now it's going to be my turn. Our turn. There. You know almost everything. - Almost? - Yes. Almost. Because... I don't want to hide anything, so I've saved the best trick for the end. Come in, it's open! Want some? No? I guess this is what I must say. Gloves... for the fingerprints. No. For the shrimp. I knew her statement would bury him in the first trial. And if I had the chance to appeal, I had to be sure she'd sound like a lunatic, so I could dig him up. I love you, Mr. Lefort. I love you, Julien. Now you know everything. Absolutely everything. What do you want? The truth? The actual truth? I can tell it to you. It's such a heavy burden. And I'm sure you won't tell anyone. I was driving when she called. It was an unknown number so I didn't answer, but I listened to her message. This is Christine. Sorry about earlier. I had too much to drink. You know Jacques. He can push people to the limit. See? I would've been better off with you. But I'll be fine. I'm going to ride to calm myself down. So I went to join her at the manege. What are you doing here? I got your message. Thank you. Really? For what? For saying you'd have been better off with me. I'm sorry, let it go. I was really upset, I was drunk... But I'm fine now. - Thanks for coming. - Did he hit you? No... it's nothing. We had a little fight, that's all. Since you're here, why don't you help me? Why didn't you choose me? I'd have never hurt you. Stop it. I already told you. I like you, but that's all. Now help me. What does he have that I don't? I mean in general, not just money. That's enough now. I'll manage. Thank you. Go away. Not before you answer me! I'm sorry. I have loved you for years. When you look at me... I see something there. Listen, we're friends. What you see is friendship. But I love you. I'm in love with you. And that unrequited love makes me suffer. No, no! There's nothing I can do for you. Please, leave. - There's one thing you can do. - What is it? What do you want? There's something you can do. You can disgust me. I need to get this out of my head, please. Go ahead, disgust me. - Disgust you? - Yes, that'd really help. With love comes admiration, and I don't admire you. You have no life. You go fishing, you lose yourself in books. You're boring, Julien. You are half-dead. And I love life. Jacques is alive, you see. He's brilliant, he's ambitious. And, above all, I love him to death. - He cheats on you, he hits you. - And? You know nothing about women. We love men that make us feel bad and good. There! Is that disgusting enough? Don't you have anything meaner? Please. OK. Jacques and you were abandoned. His mother probably regrets it. But not yours. Shut up. Shut up! I was stupefied, dazed by what I'd just done. And then suddenly, I realized it was an opportunity to get revenge. To get him accused. So I untied her scarf, dipped it in her blood, and left a few stains in the studio and her cart. You're not interested? Do I disgust you too? You'd like me to shut up, eh? But I'll go on. It's a relief. When I was inverting the spurs, I saw her cellphone. It'd fallen in the struggle. And that's when I had the idea. An idea he wouldn't have had. Who's smarter now? I dialed my phone number, and when the machine answered, I got on the horse. Before jumping off the horse, I let out a little cry, like she would've done. I think that was the closest we had ever been. Yeah, go ahead. Bawl at me, Clebs. You're right. You're right, bawl at me. Bawl at me! I deserve it! I deserve it! I deserve it. One thing at a time. - Hello? - Mr. Leonardi? - Yes. - I'm Mr. Lefort's ex-wife. I'm going to need your services. Subtitles: Eclair Media
