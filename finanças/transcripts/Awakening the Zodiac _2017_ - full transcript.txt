? Hands down ? Ou, wa-ouu ? You're the baddest girl around ? Wa-ouu ? Can I please take you o-o-out? ? Ou, wa-ouu ? Can I take you downtown? ? Stop. What? Someone's coming. Shit. Who is it? Beats me, I can't see anything. This is freaking me out, Adam, you said that no one ever comes up here. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) POLICE OFFICER: Are you okay, ma'am? Yes, sir. Sorry, Officer. I suppose you gave us a bit of a scare. There's no parking here after sundown. Sorry, Officer. You been drinking, son? Mama said never to drink on a first date. (NERVOUS LAUGHTER) First date, very nice. All right. You kids get out of here. Yes, sir. Thank you, Officer. Sorry, Officer. (EXHALES) Oh, boy, what a drag. You are so lucky he didn't bust you for drinking. Yeah, he had no right. Besides, only park rangers can ticket you in these parts. (LAUGHS) You are so full of it. (CAR IGNITION STARTS) Come on. This guy is just dying to give us a ticket. (SIGHS) What the hell is he doing? God damn. No, Adam. You're such an idiot! Officer, I don't know what you think I was doing, but... Hey, you're not the... What the hell is that? Who the hell are you? Hey, mister, I'm talking to you! LULA: No, Adam! (ADAM GROANING IN PAIN) Please, no, we didn't do anything wrong! Run, Lula! Run! (GUNSHOT) Help! Help! (LULA COUGHING) (GROANS) (MAN GROANS IN PAIN) (GUNSHOT) (MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, honey, I'm home. Hey. Hey. What did you do with the, uh, grocery money? And how was your day? Let me tell you a little bit about mine. It was great. You want one? Where'd it all go? To our future. Harvey won us the bid on that storage locker. Oh, God, another one? (EXHALES SHARPLY) You know, it's your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your future, Zoe. What? That's a quote by your Anthony Robbins. (LAUGHS) You didn't even read that book. Maybe a little. Oh, my God. Baby, we got that riding mower, remember? We sold that for a good buck, and then what about that storage locker with all that silverware? We made out like bandits on that. Mick, that's two, what about all the other ones? Oh, Lord Jesus. Okay, what did you end up paying for this one? (CLICKS TONGUE) 1,200 What? $1,200? Yeah. Mick, that's three months' rent. Harv and I split it, so... I'm gonna kill you right now. (GRUNTING) I'm mad at you, we can't... Mick, we're never gonna get out of this shitbox betting on storage lockers. What are you saying? What am I saying? I mean... Oh, God. It's not what I'm saying, it's what you're saying. You sit there, and you sit there, and go, "Oh, Zoe, I wanna give you a better life." "Oh, Zoe, I wanna actually give you a real house one day." But I'm the only grown-up standing here in the room, and I don't wanna be the grown-up. Don't even, don't even. No, no, no, no, no, just... What? This is your special spot, your special spot. (LAUGHS) I hate you so much right now. What do we own now? Well, let's go talk to Harvey, and check it out, right? You're so rotten. Stop it. Get outta here. (SNIFFING) Come on, babe. MICK: So, Tina, she was the one who tipped us off. She said it was owned by some rich old woman. And I ain't talking like, living in a trailer with a Caddy in the driveway kind of rich, I'm talking more like Real Housewives of Atlanta kind of rich. Baby, we got to take this thing in before it completely craps out on us, okay? Yeah, yeah, I know. Just as soon as we can pay for it. Cut me some slack. I didn't say anything! I'm just trying to dig us out of this rut. (LAUGHING) Do you have a bulldozer? Pfft. Man, you know I'm ain't programed to take shit from nobody. It ain't in my genes. Is having a roof over your head in your genes? How much money do you think you've actually made on these lockers over the past two years? I don't know, a little over $1,000. So, you just threw most of that back today on one locker. That's all I'm saying. My sister's got it better than us, and she's in jail. Hot damn, you serious? (MICK LAUGHS) I got a good feeling about this one, okay? Oh, baby, you always do. I got a good feeling about this one. You always do. HARVEY: Come on, get in here. Jesus, Harvey. You look like shit. Diggity. Hot diggity. Aw, now, there's a ray of sunshine. Where have you been? Oh, hey, Harvey. Hey, you know what? You get prettier and prettier every time I see ya. Don't try to sweet talk me, where's all the crap you guys bought? It's that pile right there. Hey, you want a beer? Sure. Man, you look like you haven't slept. Wow! I haven't. So, this is it? Yeah, well, those are the best pieces. That's, uh, like, I don't know, 300 bucks, and we got some stuff back in the locker, $100, $120. So, we're talking $400, $425 for the whole lot. $425 for the whole thing? Whoo! Hold on, hold on. Tina's never steered us wrong before. Well, honey, looks like you guys got screwed like a 10-cent whore on nickel night. HARVEY: No, no, no. I was going through those boxes there, and I found something. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Follow me. It was hidden deep inside this nasty dresser. Come here, check this out. Home movies? They're dated. 09-27-69. Oh, great, so, now you're the proud owners of somebody's 40-year-old wedding movies. No, not a wedding. I watched them. Follow me. Up here. (ZOE GRUNTS) Go in straight, and then to your right. Oh, real classy, Harv. Don't fucking touch that. That's collector's edition. How do you keep inventory of all this crap? Oh, Christ, Harvey. HARVEY: I got a photographic memory. I think you have a concussion right about now. (SIGHS) Hey, let's watch some movies! What do you keep in here, a dead body? (GASPS) Oh, Jesus. You okay? Can we just go? Yeah, let's, uh... Harv? Harvey? Harvey? Here. (SCREAMS) (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) ZOE: Okay, so, home movies. I really hope this gets better, Harv. Just keep watching. Shit. What happened? (SNIFFING) Uh, this film, it's just really old and degraded. It's okay, I saw it. Is it ruined? What was it? Can you just hold your panties? I'll hold my panties. (SIGHS) I'm just gonna put in the second reel. Just have some patience. Here we go. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) This one's hard to watch. Whoa! What the hell is this, Harv? (PROJECTOR CLICKS OFF) It's the Zodiac. Zodiac? Yeah, that's why I stayed up all night researching this shit. This guy claims to have killed 37 people. Only, the cops confirmed five. Holy shit. HARVEY: Here. He taunted the police with letters containing ciphers that to this day have gone unsolved. Not even the FBI have been able to solve them. (TYPING) There he is. That's our guy in the film. Jesus Christ. MICK: I've seen that picture before. The numbers on these cans. 09-27-69. Punch that in, babe. (TYPING) "Napa, California. Cecelia Shepard attacked on..." "September 27th, 1969, on the shore line of Lake Berryessa. "Shepard died of her wounds." See, what'd I tell ya? What are the other dates on those? 06-18-68. ZOE: 06-18-68. Nothing. All right. Try 08-31-68. 08-31-68. Nope. HARVEY: Search "murders." He was never caught. The search for the Zodiac Killer has been like the search for the fucking Holy Grail. HARVEY: Here you go. Okay. First of all, you don't even know if those are real, and second, you should let the police handle this. That's what I would do. How is any of this stuff in an old lady's locker? Maybe it wasn't an old lady's locker. Mick, think about it, you'd never store evidence like this in your own name, right? MICK: Well... "San Francisco Police Department re-opens Zodiac case." Which is exactly why you call the police. No, no, you're not looking close enough. Look where it says, "Reward for evidence leading to the Zodiac Killer." $100,000. Boo-yah! Divine intervention. Come on, baby. This could be my ticket to Costa Rica. You guys are nuts. Zoe, there are a million theories on the Internet that the Zodiac filmed his kills. I've seen my fair share of America's Most Wanted. This is not enough evidence to prove anything. No, you're absolutely right. All we have to do is find out who they belong to, and then we have something worth 100,000 fucking dollars. ZOE: Hey, Mick? I gotta go, I gotta go do, um, Ellie's hair. I'll be in the vehicle. She'll be fine. She's been this way since Freda closed the salon. Are you sure we can make some money off this thing? I don't know, man, but I do know that that's the guy on the film. Here. You take it, you put it in a safe place because these could be our meal tickets. We go 50-50, you want to do this with me. Come on, man. We already know where the first stop is, right? Fifty-fifty. Fiddy-fiddy. $50,000 each. I'll let you know. Okay. Evening, Ray. (SNORING) Good night, Ray. (CONTINUES SNORING) Baby. Come on, come to bed. We can talk about this tomorrow. Um, there's nothing to talk about. It's a lot of money. Do you hear yourself, Mick? Because you are talking, um, about a serial killer, so... I know. Good. So, there's nothing to talk about. Baby, I get a vote in this, too. We are talking about $100,000. Mick, I let you convince me to move to this shitty town. MICK: Oh... I let you convince me to sell my mama's jewelry to pay rent and pay the bills... Hey, hey, what'd you want me to do? You were out of work. That's not fair because I am doing my part in this, okay? I did Ellie today, I have somebody tomorrow... And that helps, but, baby, I am not making shit mowing lawns and throwing out trash. So, your solution is hunting a serial killer for a reward? It's $100,000. Good night. (LAWNMOWER HUMMING) (KIDS GIGGLING) (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Hey, baby. You left without saying goodbye. I know, you were sleeping and I didn't want to wake you. Look, Mick, I don't want to fight with you. Neither do I. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but, um... Oh, Lord Jesus. If you honestly think this thing is legit, then let's do it. Are you sure you're up for this? No, but that's real money, and we're running out of options. This could be the one we're been waiting for, baby. I hope so. All right, let me check back in with Harvey then. Great, love you. Love you, too. All right. TINA: This is Tina. Uh-huh. MAN: Tina, why'd you change the lock on my locker? I gotta get in there... I've heard it all before, honey. Just come by the office tomorrow and make a partial payment, okay? All right. All right. (HUMMING) (BANGING ON DOOR) Oh, jeez. (DOOR BUZZES) All right, Harv, we're in. You mean Zoe said yes? Oh, shut up, and let's just get to work. (LAUGHS) Shut up, Harvey. What is that smell? Yes, this is perchlorethylene. It's like a pedicure for this old film. It, like, pulls off any sludge and restores moisture. Yeah, so, it won't burn up again. Huh. Well, aren't you a trick. You should give me your reel, so I can clean it up. Oh, our reel is doing just fine, Harv. Well, I hope you have it hid good 'cause it's half the key to our fortune. We heard you the first time, Harv. It's taken care of. We're gonna talk to Tina at the U-Store-All. Yep. And find out who actually rented this locker. HARVEY: Oh, good idea. Now, I wanna see the rest of that crap we bought. (WOMAN SOBBING) (MUFFLED SCREAM) (CAMERA BEEPS) (SCREAMING) (GAGGING) ZOE: All right. Which one is it? MICK: This one right here. What the hell? Where's all the crap? I sure as hell hope Tina moved it. Ugh! What the hell? Ugh... She's always here. Tina, it's Mick. Where are you? I need to get some things. Call me back ASAP, huh? Yeah, I don't get this. She's always here. Honey, I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure she just ran out to get a bite to eat or something. God damn it. Jeez. What, are you gonna go in, guns-a-blazing? Break in the joint? I don't know, maybe just have a look around. Oh, no, oh. Oh, my God. This is a very bad idea. Get down. (WHISPERS) Okay, this is perfect. Okay. Okay, what are we doing? This is the locker number. I want you to check the computer, I'll check the filing cabinets. You realize that you seem oddly comfortable with all of this. Honey, we haven't been out of the trailer in months. This is the most excitement I've had in years. I'll tell what, if you play your cards right and don't say anything mean, you might just get lucky tonight. Oh, is that right? That is right. Okay, get to work. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't mind some... Get to work! All right. Okay. Files are labeled under customer names. Yeah, mine, too. What about customers who haven't paid their bills or... Yeah, arrears. Yeah. (COMPUTER BEEPS) Okay, it's a long list. It's a woman. It's under a woman's name. Okay. Okay, that's gotta cut it down. Um, you ready? Yeah. Try "Hilly Martino." Hilly Martino. All right, found it. That is locker number 84. Oh, that's not it. Okay... Um, Elsa Carlingson. Elsa... Yeah, nope. Okay, Betty Ferguson. Betty Ferguson. Betty Ferguson. Locker number 45. We got it. Shh. Don't get too excited. BOTH: Uh... Says she hasn't paid in three weeks. Good Lord. That's how long before they start selling your stuff? That's rough. They're not fucking around at the U-Store-All. You got an address? Yup, let's go. Wait, you mean tonight? Get the hell outta here. I don't wanna nose around some serial killer's house in the middle of the night, right? Copy that. Copy that. Right. This is so crazy. Tina? Tina? Hey, Mick, come on, let's go. Is that you? Mick, come on. Let's go, babe. Hey! Mick, come on, let's go. Please? Stay in the truck. I got this. What are you doing, Mick? Hey! Who's there? I suggest you show your face before I crack it open. Mick, come on. No, no, no. Babe, come on, please? This is your last warning, bro. Mick, come on, now! (HORN HONKS) Hey. Honking the horn, seriously? Let's go. You fucking crazy? I'm not the one sitting there holding the shovel in his hands. Let's get out of here. Who was that guy? God! I don't know, but I wanna call Harv, share our intel, huh? Please, lock your door. Oh, my God. (SQUEALS) That was crazy! I can't believe we did that. Hot damn. That was amazing. That was nuts. That was a whole lotta crazy. You're a whole lotta crazy. (GIGGLES) You're crazy. Thank you. Off. Yes. Off. My hands are stuck, my hands are stuck. It's okay, I'll take them outta there. (GIGGLING) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (FLOORBOARDS CREAK) It's okay. (FRIDGE DOOR OPENS) Oh, Jesus Christ, Ray. Oh, sorry, man, didn't mean to wake you up, just ran out of beer. You scared the shit out of me. Do you know what time it is? Sorry, Mick. Oh, it's all right. (EXHALES) I can't sleep, anyway. Grab me one of those, will ya? You know, you can't keep coming in unannounced like that. Probably get your head bashed in one of these days. Okay. But why so edgy, hasn't ever much bothered you before. We're in the midst of a thing. Can't really say. RAY: Oh! Okay. Listen, I know it's none of my business, but can I give you some advice? Yeah. Don't mess around with shit you don't understand. Shit you don't know nothing about. What are you talking about? I seen all that Zodiac Killer shit on your table in there. You're right, it ain't any of your damn business. There's boundaries, Ray. I don't mind you taking a beer every now and then, but don't be going through my shit, dude. I was there. Where? San Fran-fucking-cisco. I was there in the '60s. That man you're so interested in? He brought that town to its knees. He struck fear in the hearts of every single law-abiding citizen in that town. We was all shitting our pants. Mommy and Daddy didn't wanna send Junior to school. The mailman was worried he was gonna get blown to pieces. For crying out loud, the cops were walking their beats like they were frightened little schoolgirls just waiting to get picked off on their sidewalks. 'Cause nobody was safe. Totally unpredictable. Beautiful. That man's an absolute genius, the way he evaded the law all this time. Do you realize that? There's never ever gonna be another man like him, not never. You sound like a fan. Bunch of theories about where he might've got to now. Some think he might still be alive. So, do yourself a favor. Just take my advice, burn that film. Forget what you seen, get on with your life, 'cause I promise you, nothing good's gonna come from this. How do you know about the film? Ah, there's no secret these cardboard walls can keep. I gotta go. I got some things I gotta take care of. At this hour? I gotta get up early. Yeah. Anyway, thanks for the beer. I'm taking it to go. All right, dude. Yeah, baby? I think it's just... It's right up here. Yup. He's been staked out here all night. Come on, come on, quick. Before someone sees you. Come on. Quick, quick, quick. Okay, okay, keep your pants on. Okay, we are here. What are we doing? Now, what do we do? Knock on her door, tell her her husband's the Zodiac Killer? I've been scoping this place out for 18 hours, nobody's come or gone or even taken a piss. I promise you, nobody's in that fucking house, and if they are, they're dead. Now, by the way, I did some research. Betty Ferguson, 91 years old, her husband, Balthazar, 94, both alive. How the hell do you know that? You owe me 15 bucks for your half. Ninety-four years old, I mean... You guys, he probably already has one foot in the grave. Look, all we gotta do is find a piece of evidence that ties Ferguson to the film, then we call the police. Boom, done, ka-ching. The FBI hasn't been able to catch him all these years, what makes you think we're going to find anything? Is that the shitty attitude we're going to start with? Maybe. How is that a shitty attitude? Because you're, like, "I don't wanna do this..." Okay, ladies, ladies. Ladies, you're both pretty, let's get to work. Can you open the door? I thought Tina told you that this lady was loaded? Oh, shit. You all right? I'm fine, go. Whoa! We're not going in there. (DOOR CLICKS OPEN) Worry not, my sweet. The good Lord is watching over you. We keep making a habit of this. Well, we're here. Opportunity has opened its door. (DOOR CLOSES) ZOE: This looks like a haunted house. HARVEY: That's good. See, I told you, nobody's here. Boo! (SHRIEKS) (LAUGHS) Wow! What exactly are we looking for? Anything. Everything. Just keep your eyes open. ZOE: Hey. You think this is Balthazar, or do you think they had a son? MICK: I can't tell. Look at this. Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco. Where the murders took place. So, this... Yeah. This has to be their son. That has to be Balthazar. HARVEY: Guys, come down here. Guys, down here. Watch your step. Look at this. ZOE: What? What? What? Come here. 8mm camera. Oh... This could be the fucking camera. ZOE: And I found a picture of Balthazar's son in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Okay, look, there's gotta be a film reel here. Just look. Like, look for a canister. Okay. Okay? Okay. All right. (THUMP) Shh. (CREAKING) (WHISPERS) Did you hear that? Yes. Yes. (CREAKING) (FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR CREAKS OPENS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) (DOOR SHUTS) Shh, shh, shh. Okay, he's gone. Let's get the fuck outta here. Listen to me, you keep your shit together. No, you keep your shit together. You're crazy. We have to find a reel, let's get a reel. Two minutes, please? Come on. He left. Let's go. Hurry up, there's gotta be one here. (CLATTERING) Shh. Found it. Harv? No way. Now, can we please go? I'll only be one second. (ZOE COUGHS) (WHISPERS) Can we please go now? Come on. Come on. It's okay, it's okay. Okay, we're clear. Come on. Hey! (GUN COCKS) Christ. Put it down, or I'll blow your head clean off your neck. I can't do that, sir. Okay, take it easy. No one needs to get hurt, for God's sake. Who are you? And what are you doing in my house? Are you Balthazar Ferguson? I'm his son, Benjamin. What are you doing here? Uh... You know, um, we didn't mean to barge in, but your door was open. We just... We bought your mama's storage locker, and we found this, um, film reel. And we thought, "You know what? Maybe they might want it back." I don't understand. They've lived in Florida for the past few years. Take a look at this place. Does it look like they needed a storage locker? Oh, so, you live here by yourself now? You guys sure do ask a lot of questions while you're staring down the barrel of a gun. (STAMMERING) We're gonna go. So, thank you, sir. So sorry. Let's go, guys. All right, we're going. Take it easy. BENJAMIN: Stop. I think you forgot something. What's that? The film, just hand it over. Well, if it isn't your mother's locker, then it's probably not her film. Yeah, so sorry. Really, really sorry. Just, um... Okay, take care. Come on. Ben, everything all right over there? Yeah, fine. These folks were just leaving. Once again, our apologies, sir. Yeah. Here's my card. If you find anything else you think might belong to me... Try calling next time. Will do. ZOE: Take care! Didn't catch your name. Y'all have a nice day. Bye-bye. (HARVEY CLEARS THROAT) Oh! God, creepy. MICK: How could you just hand it to him? That film could have sealed the deal. Are you serious? What was I supposed to do, run? Seriously, you guys, what if that was really the guy and I didn't give him the film? (SCOFFING) What? He would've just killed us right there? Yeah. That was the guy. Yeah, it had to have been. HARVEY: No, it wasn't. Harvey? Are you serious? What are the chances he'd have a camera and a roll of 8mm film? And there was the photo of him in San Francisco by the Golden Gate Bridge. And he worked for a newspaper, which they always thought. ZOE: He's the right age. And it was his storage locker. And he had a fucking gun in our face. Why would he let the locker go? He's old, maybe he just forgot. Well... You guys, we gotta go back. We gotta lift prints, or do something like that. Lift some prints? That's my girl, yeah. You guys been watching too many CSI: Miami re-runs. Trust me, he's not our guy. He didn't have that killer look. That killer look? HARVEY: Yeah, no joke. I saw it in Kuwait. You know, some soldiers, they live for the action, others were scared shitless, and then there were the stone-cold fucking killers. When you watch a man kill another man, and then he turns and looks at you, his eyes soft, relaxed, almost satisfied, you know you're in the presence of a real killer. That other reel should be dry by now. I'll meet you back at my place, yeah? Yeah, okay. (SNIFFLES) (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) Wait, what was that? Looked like a cipher key. A what? What? Remember I told you that he sent letters to the newspapers in code? Yeah. Just watch. Right after he passes the gun, right before he wipes the blood off the knife. That paper with the symbols on it. ZOE: What do you see? I think this is a cipher key. This could be the cipher key. What are you talking about? Code-breaking. The Zodiac, he always claimed that his name was in the cipher. This could be the fucking key. (STAMMERING) I'm sorry, Harv, I don't understand. Can you just speak English? Okay, these kinds of codes, they were used by, like, the CIA and foreign governments to encrypt messages going all the way back to World War II. Next to each symbol is a letter. You replace each symbol with the correlating letter, and you have the translation. I can see that you don't understand. I'll show you. I don't understand. Okay. What does that say? MICK: It's symbols. Right. Now, this is a cipher key. "E" has a corresponding square. "O" has an upside-down triangle. "Z" has a "V." This reads "Zoe." "Zoe." It's easy if you have the key. Almost impossible if you don't. Oh, man. This could be the key to the 340. What's the 340? It's the unsolved cipher. The 408 was broken. MICK: How do you know all this shit? Two tours, special ops, remember? They taught you code-breaking in Kuwait? Oh, yeah, it's like the ABCs of electronic intelligence, but back in the day, code-breaking was like basic training. ZOE: Think you could crack it? If this is a cipher key, fucking A. Okay. HARVEY: I gotta get into this. Why don't you guys check on Ben's history? Like, go to Town Hall and newspapers and see if he has a military record. Because this shit here is military 101. Done. Yeah? My coat, thanks. ZOE: Hey, Harvey, good one. Hey, by the way, bring me your reel in the morning. I wanna put it in my safe. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) ZOE: Babe, Harvey wouldn't screw us over. He's a good guy, right? MICK: I don't know. Let me just drop you off at Town Hall and I'll go hide the film. ZOE: Wait, are you saying you don't trust him either? Let's just say I wanna make sure we get our half. Smart boy. Yup. Hey. Um... Call you when I'm done? Careful. Love ya. Love ya! Thank you. Beautiful. (DOG BARKING) Oh... (GRUNTS SOFTLY) RECEPTIONIST: Tri-County News Ledger. Yes, no problem. Thank you. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Hey, excuse me? Hi. Um... These only go back to 1980. Where would I find articles dating back to the late '60s? Archives is in the basement. ZOE: Oh. For employees only. Um... Polly, it's kind of important. I'm sorry, we're about to close. I bet you are, but it's just that I was... Um... I've been at city records, and couldn't find what I was looking for over there and it would be so helpful... Miss, I can't help you. (PHONE RINGING) Tri-County News Ledger. Hey, Polly. Yes, he is. Uh-huh. Yes, he is. Okay, I'll let him know. Thanks, Polly. Thank you. Thank you, Polly! Okay. Thank you so much, ma'am. Yup. (BEEPING) (ELEVATOR DINGS) (ELEVATOR DINGS) (SIGHS) Hello. (RUMBLING) (BREATHING HEAVY) God damn it. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? (STATIC) Hello? (BANG) (PHONE BEEPS) "The Zodiac has fled the West Coast, leaving behind a trail "of unsolved murders across the country. "I have provided authorities with "new evidence from an unnamed source "that I believe will eventually "lead to the identity of the elusive killer." (ELEVATOR DINGS, RUMBLES) (PAPERS SHUFFLING) Come on. Come on, come on. Oh, Mick. Um, Mick, it's me. Listen, I'm at the paper. I need you to come get me because I think I found something good. Um... Okay, I'm here. Come get me, now. Okay, bye. Shit. (PANTS) (SCREAMS) Oh, my God. I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Oh, God! Shit! (ELEVATOR DINGS) (ZOE BREATHING HEAVILY) Hey, are you all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm good. Um... Okay, Ferguson. Um... He was an only child. He was born and raised here. He was never married. He never had kids. Uh, he served in Vietnam from 1963 to 1964. Zodiac's first kill was 1968. Then after Vietnam, in 1965, he got a job with a paper in San Francisco as a crime reporter. San Francisco? Oh, this is good. Yeah. Okay, but there's just a little hitch in the giddy-up. So, for some reason, Ferguson decided to leave that job with that paper in San Francisco and move back here to start a job with the old Ledger on, um, October the 1st, 1969. The thing is, Paul Lee Stine was killed in San Francisco on October 11th, 1969. Shit. Told you. So, listen, I know he's weird, but he can't be our guy because he was here, 2,500 miles away. But listen to this, I found an article that Ferguson wrote about Zodiac. And Ferguson was tracking this string of murders across the country, and he had come up with this theory that Zodiac was actually making his way across the country to here. So, maybe Ferguson was actually onto the Zodiac, and maybe the Zodiac is still here now. Or he was leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for the police to follow. Oh, my God, what are you talking about? Why aren't you listening to me? Shit, I don't know. Some people say he didn't even live in San Fran. What people? I read it on a fan site. He has fans? Apparently. Lots of them. Do you see a guy? Feels like there's a guy just parked behind us. I'm probably... Let's get out of here. Babe, let's just go. What the hell? No, no, no. I'm gonna kick this guy's ass. No, no. Don't you... No, no, no. Honey, honey! Hey! Get in the car, let's just go. I'm not... Fine! Go ahead! Come on! MICK: Did you get a good look at him? ZOE: No, I did not get a good look. (TRAILER DOOR OPENS) (TRAILER DOOR CLOSES) God, I don't wanna do this anymore. Mick, it's getting too crazy, and I... Zoe, we need this. I don't... I'm out. We don't need this, Mick. (STAMMERING) Do you know what half of $100,000 is? You know what? Don't act like I'm an idiot. Mick, put that gun down! Jesus Christ. It's $50,000, Mick! That's it! MICK: That's a lot of money. I think I'm worth more than $25,000. That's not what I meant. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Look at you. MAN: (ON LAPTOP) This is the Zodiac speaking. This is the Zodiac speaking. (BANG) This is the Zodiac speaking. This is the Zodiac speaking. Son of a bitch. ZOE: What is it? MICK: I think he's out there. This is the Zodiac speaking. God damn it. (WIND CHIMES CHIMING) (GASPS) Jesus! Fuck... Zoe? Fuck! Baby... Fuck you. Jesus. No, fuck you! Don't you fucking come... Fuck you! Everything okay? Do you know who owns this car? This car? It's whoever she's sleeping with. Her in that trailer, what's her name? Uh... Come on, you know it. Spanish name... Valencia, that's it. Now, the thing about Valencia is, there's a different car here, like, every night. Although I hate to be judgmental, she's kind of a whore. I don't know if that helps, does it? Yeah. Want a beer? No. (BANG) MICK: Hey, baby. You know I'm sorry. You pointed a gun in my face, that's not okay. I know, I know. I'm sorry. And, obviously, sorry isn't cutting it, I... I know I messed up. ZOE: That's an understatement. Messed up bad, but, baby, I swear, (EXHALES) I heard something. Zoe, I need you. I do, I can't do this without you. (SCOFFS) Can we please just go see if Harvey's figured out the cipher key? Hmm? Maybe he has. Maybe this is all over already. And if it doesn't pan out, I'll work our way out of this. I promise, no more storage lockers, no more nothing. I promise you. I will give you one more day. (KNOCKING) (GUN COCKS) Ah, shit. (DOOR BUZZES) Come on in, close the door. Shut the door! Fast! Jesus. Just shut it. Holy shit, Harvey. I've almost figured it out. This fucking dude was a genius, man. He used a combination of a Caesar, Vigenere and Pigpen cipher. Look, I'll explain it to you. You see this symbol? All these years, codebreakers have considered this its own character, right? This one symbol is four letters, but this... This symbol here, this is one letter, shifted with a Caesar cipher. Like a fucking brainiac, this guy. Okay, so, I can make some critical assumptions, and I've narrowed it down to suspects that live within a 50-mile radius. That's only hundreds. No, no, no. I think it's Ben Ferguson. No. Yeah, yeah, he served in the military. He was in San Fran between '67 and '69. Mick, Mick, you're like everybody else. You're trying to fit the evidence to the suspect. That's not how you do it. It's not Ben Ferguson. I don't know how many fucking times I have to say that. Don't even try, he won't even listen. Mick, his name doesn't even fit in the cipher. I just need some more time. I kind of just, like, fell asleep for an hour, but if I can get one more symbol, I can eliminate 97% of these names, okay? I can't do it with you guys here, though. You need to... All right. I need to be alone, so... Can ya pick me up a sandwich, or something? I'm fucking starving. All right, great. MICK: Yeah. ZOE: Harvey seems like he's losing it. Yeah. I got it. I got it! I got it! It's "E"! It's fucking "E"! Okay, okay, okay. Eliminate those. Boo-yah! Do you see that? Yup. Don't brake, don't brake. Mick, please drive. Drive. All right. Holy shit. You think Tina reported our little break-in? It's fine, it'll blow over. Just... Let's go get Harvey his food. (ENGINE STOPS) Where's Harvey's van? Doubt he'd leave. By the smell of him, he hasn't left this place in two days. Can you... Yes. Honey, we're home! Harvey? We brought you some barbecue. Where you at? Harvey? Whoa! He split. What? He split. No. No, no, no. Not gonna let him get away with this. He's gonna take the whole reward. Oh, God. (BREATHING HEAVILY) I knew he'd do something like this. God damn it. ZOE: Oh, Mick. What a jerk. Shit. He's such a jerk. No, no, no. It's gonna be fine. Something in these pages. He said if he could find, uh, one more of these symbols... Uh-huh. ...he could cut that list down to... Like a handful, right? Right? Yeah, right, right. Baby, look. He did it. He found it. He figured it out. Holy shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This... Okay, I've got a page here with all the names and addresses crossed off. I got one more. Oh, good. One... That's one, two, three. Okay, hold on. Here's one not crossed off. Uh... Gimme that. I've got one, too. Ah! Here's one crossed off. What do you got? How many is that? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Nine. All right. Okay. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) Okay, baby. Yeah, all right. We're not looking for the Zodiac now. Here. Now... Thank you. We're going after Harvey. You're sure you're up for this? Oh, hell, yeah. Okay. (DRIPPING) Jesus. Shit. What is it? I don't know. Ugh, look for some shotgun shells for that thing, okay, hon? Okay, I got it. Go. Hey, Mick, I found some! MICK: Great. Mick! Mick, Harvey just took off! Get down here! Hang on. Zoe. Honey, he's getting away! Shit. Damn it! Zoe! (ZOE REVS ENGINE) Jesus! Zoe! (PANTING) Mick? Zoe. Okay, listen to me. Harvey... No, no, listen to me. I can see Harvey's van right in front of me, okay? I love you. Just come get me. Bye! No, no, no, Harvey's dead! (CAR HONKING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (HONKING) (LINE RINGING) Fuck! Where are the goddamn keys? (KEYS JINGLE) (GRUNTS) (LINE RINGING) Come on. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Hey, it's Zoe. Leave a... Damn it. (CAR HONKING) (HONKING) Come on, Zoe. Pick up. Hey, it's Zoe. Leave a message. Damn it! Come on. Come on. Where are you? Shit. (TIRES SCREECHING) Come on. Come on. Come on. Damn it. (FLIES BUZZING) (PANTING) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) (LINE RINGING) OPERATOR: 911. State your emergency. My wife's been abducted. What is your name, sir, and what is your location? Yeah, I'm Mick Bradley. I'm at 1228 Cherry Street. A man is dead. Sir, calm down. There's a unit on its way. Okay, okay. Harvey! Don't move! What are you doing, man? Harvey, don't play games with me... I got a big-ass gun, Harvey, and I'm not afraid to use it. Come on! (GROANS) Laurel. Laurel. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Zoe? MAN: This is the Zodiac speaking. I have your wife. She doesn't have to die. You listen to me. Don't you fucking touch her, I'll... You'll what? You do not have control here. The police do. The police are, what? On their way? Oh, then I guess she's going to have to die. No, no. Don't, don't, don't. They don't know anything. And? And I have the film reel. Good. Well, then perhaps there is hope for her yet. Zoe, is it? Please, don't. I assume that as you have made it this far, you know how to find me. (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) (ENGINE STARTS) ? I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ? Yankee Doodle, do or die ? Born in the image of my Uncle Sam ? Born on the Fourth of July ? She's my Yankee Doodle sweetheart ? I'm her Yankee Doodle guy ? (ZOE BREATHING HEAVILY) You must be very proud. (ZOE WHIMPERING) Fuck you. (COUGHING) After all these years, after all the police departments and the FBI profilers and programmers, all looking for me, they all come up empty. But you, you found me. Now, go figure. Why? Well, you have my films. Now, I quit. (COUGHS) Cold turkey. For 40 years. You have no idea the monumental effort that that took. But I got away scot-free. Except for Ben, of course. He got close. Him I had to follow. I followed him all the way from San Francisco. I was gonna kill him, but I grew to like it here. Now, that fat-ass woman, she sold my locker. I missed two payments. My memory ain't what it used to be. Too bad. (ZOE WHIMPERING) I wanna tell you something. This is my story. You're not gonna destroy my legend. (SOBBING) (ELECTRIC SPARK) (ZOE WHIMPERING) I left you a way out if you're brave enough to try. You know, they herded a lot of young animals through here on their last journey. And they designed this place to ease their anxiety as they herded them to the slaughter. I don't think it's gonna have the same effect on you. (SIGHS) It's gonna hurt, but what can I say? Enjoy. Oh, your husband's on his way. I'm gonna kill him first. ZOE: No! No! (SOBBING) God. (TIRES SCREECH) ZOE: Fuck! (ELECTRIC SPARK) Ow! God damn it! (GROANS) Come on, baby, come on. Come on. (GPS TALKING) All right, there it is. There it is. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Forty-five. .38 caliber. Holy shit, it fits. Come on! (TIRES SQUEAL) (GUNSHOT) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Where is she? Oh, she's fine. I need to see the reel. You put down your goddamn gun! I need to see the film! Okay. (GUNSHOT) (GROANS) (GROANING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Fuck. Okay, okay, okay. (ELECTRIC BUZZING) Ow! (GRUNTS) By golly, I nailed him. (SOBBING) No, you... (GROANS) (BUZZING) MICK: Zoe? Zoe? ZOE: Mick? Mick, baby, I'm over here! Shit. Mick, he's in here. MICK: Where is he? Mick, help! (BANGING) (GRUNTS) Mick! Mick! Mick, Mick, Mick! Jesus Christ. We gotta get out of here somewhere. I know. We have to get out of here. (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) Go! Go! Go, baby! Go! (ELECTRIC SPARK) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Ahh! (VAN DOOR CLOSES) (IGNITION STARTS) Fuck. Fuck you! (GLASS BREAKS) (GROANING) (SCREAMING) Get the fuck... Fuck! Don't move! Don't fucking move! Well, this is not gonna end well for you. I will shoot that fucking smile off your fucking face, Grandpa, I swear to God, I will. Go ahead, pull the trigger. A lot of people have tried. Shut up! Put me out of my misery. Go ahead, do it now! (GUN CLICKS) (SCREAMING) (COUGHING) By golly, I wish this could go on forever. (GRUNTS) (COUGHING) (SCREAMING) (GASPING FOR AIR) (SCREAMING) Zoe! Mick. Mick. Behind you! (GUNSHOT) (MICK GROANS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) God... Come here. Oh, my God. FBI AGENT: After four weeks of investigation, the FBI, with the cooperation of the local authorities, using DNA evidence, have positively linked the deceased to the three local homicides. We have been unable to make a positive identification on the deceased. We are currently investigating those scenes and his residence for any other pertinent evidence. The investigation is ongoing, but I can tell you at this time we cannot exclude or confirm the DNA of the now deceased suspect as a match for the Zodiac Killer. After 40 years, the earlier samples are just unreliable. I know there's a lot of families out there that are looking for some closure, but, uh, it's gonna take a long, long time before we know for sure. I'll take your questions now. (ELECTRIC SPARK) Shit. Hey. ZOE: What? Mick? What's wrong? What is it? No, baby. It's just me just being my clumsy self. (GROANS SOFTLY) Have I been sleeping? You've been asleep for a long time. Sorry. It's okay, come here. Come here. Come sit with me. It's going to be all right. There you go. Oh... Yeah, look at us. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Hey, so, Frank came by today. Yeah? Yeah. He offered me my old job at the mill. Even some extra hours doing security. Did you take it? Hell, yeah, I did. That's good. Mm. It's time to make a real go of things, baby. You mean the world to me. What's wrong with that light? It's just... It's a light. It's always like that. You know, it just needs a good kicking. We gotta... We should fix it. I'll tell ya what, I'm gonna go fix it right now, okay? No, no, no, please stay here. Just please stay here. Baby, baby, it's okay. It's okay. I got this, all right? I don't want you to go. I'll be back in a second, okay? Hey, I love you. (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (TRAILER DOOR CLOSES) Just breathe. (POWER SWITCHES OFF) (LIGHT THUD) Mick? Mick? Mick! ZOE: Mick? (PROJECTOR CLICKING) ? I've been walking over graves ? Carving out the headstone that I own, my own ? I'm like a monster in a cage ? Trapped inside a maze ? I am home, I'm home ? I'm here and gone ? I'm dead and done ? I know there's nothing I can change ? And I regret the things I didn't say ? I resent how I walked away ? Now I'm digging my own grave ? Now I'm digging my own, digging my own grave ? I know there's nothing I can change ? And I regret the things I didn't say ? I resent how I walked away ? Now I'm digging my own grave ? Now I'm digging my own, digging my own grave ? Is there peace beyond the rage? ? 'Cause I've been digging my own ? Digging my own grave ?
