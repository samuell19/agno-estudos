So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. F. S. Fitzgerald. If they're blocking sediment, the dams must go. We have no choice. Listen... I'll be right there. I have an emergency. Have a good day. It's delicate for elected officials, but it won't cause a tsunami. ...their 3rd shark attack this year. Some limbs have yet to be found. The search continues. Hello, Mr. Kerbec... BOARDROOM Dynamic contract. Unit-liked investment. Dolphin Contract. Secure contract, privileging monetary products... Turtle Contract. And a mixed one. Remember your 6 o'clock. Very well. See you next week. YANN Sit down And watch... From everyone. What you always dreamed of. Thanks. But what will I dream of now? Hold on, just a sec. Coming back? Come dance. - No thanks. - Don't be a party poop. You ask me to dance but you know I don't like to. Why insist? I don't know. I hope you'll say yes. You see the vodka? How are you, Brigitte? Mr. Kerbec! You've drunk too much. Want a taxi? I think you're doing something you'll regret Monday at the office. Blow out the candles, honey bunny! We had a great idea about that mixed contract. What about... "Bat Contract"? Double animal: half rodent, half bird. A bat is not a bird. It's too dark for life insurance. Get me 2 champagnes. Can I see the chair? Come. Who made it again? Art Vandelay, a steampunk designer I like. Inspired by time travel, Wells. Dunno. But he must be rich because it cost a fortune. Kidding aside. Don't take it to the office. Not company style. Your father never would have. Two champagnes. Excuse me. Cheers. Really nice, wasn't it? Sorry it was only your colleagues. I don't get it. You had friends before. You never mention them. It's crazy. Why don't you see them? Who's the guy in the pictures? A hidden brother? Where were they? Your Mom's house. A shoebox in your room. Who was he? You look close. Why I don't know? I don't want you snooping. You're unbelievable! I organize a surprise birthday party, and you accuse me of snooping? Stop screaming. I have to speak for both of us! You're mute. No one knows what you think or feel. Maybe nothing at all. I thought you'd like it. What do you know of my likes? What do you know? Friendship Roster If ever you feel like it, it's here. - Thomas? - Who is it? It's Yann. It's crazy to... Stop talking. I'm not here. Leave a message. Hello, Thomas. It's Yann. Surprised you have the same number. I think you have the same dumb message too. Here's my number, just in case... Yann? Hey. You okay? Roger, can I have vodka and apple juice? Sure thing. What's this? Another herbal tea or a man drink? No, I'm fine. Roger, make it two. Two vodka-apples, coming up! I drank a lot last night. It was my birthday. Now I get it. You look like crap. I thought, damn Yann got old! It's because you partied till dawn. Yeah, no... till twelve. Thirty. Mega fiesta. How old are you now? Same as you. Come. Do you remember us or not? What do you do? I took over my Dad's brokerage firm. Cool... what did he broker again? Life insurance. And you? Burger Forever. You still work there? Forever. Married? You? Any kids? And you? I've got plenty of time. No rush. My wife Estelle and I would like... we'd like to have... Plenty of time, right? Roger. Another round. It's wild he's not dead. He was old back then. Yes, but I think that guy is immortal. He's a Highlander. We must decapitate him! The only one left. What? Nothing. I'm happy to see you. Me too. Cheers... Bottoms up! Same old moped? Yeah. Still have yours? I sold it ages ago. You're crazy. I'd never let mine go. That from your crash? Skid of the century, dude. Come on. Get on. - I won't get on. - Spare me. - Just one helmet. - Who cares? Here! Come on, broker. Hold on tight! Crazy you're still here! Come in. Amazing. Nothing's changed. To us! - What is it? - Clos du Cigalou. We drank it when we were poor. Cheap but good. Excellent. Hollow leg. Another glass? Maybe later. Did I send you this? We were so tacky. Given the handwriting, I was what... 12? Did you keep mine? At my mom's house. Same shoebox, same dumb jokes. It's Ali Baba's cave here. What's this? Let me see. A guest list. Remember your birthday parties? Everyone wanted to come. Not like last night, over at twelve. Thirty. Your 18th birthday. How do you remember everything? It's hard to forget. Max! DJ Mad Max! The Night Horseman! Eagle of the Decks! Coolest guy at school. The craziest, above all. Total psycho! Emma... Emma Latour, your big love. Who dumped who? I can't remember. Geraldine Fragonard. Nympho Frago. I hear she had edible undies. - Justine, Melanie... - Laetitia. You puked in her hood? - No. - Bullshit. Vincent Montluc, class stud. Lobsta. - We called him that for the tattoo. - Why a lobster? No, it's a scorpion Bad artist. Natasha Cachou, Philippo... Philippo! I have to return his Walkman. - It's not too late. - I don't know where I put it. Hash Man Bartarin! His hash made your words slur. We called him Pimple Pizza. That was Fred Fournier. No, Fournier was "Crunch". - Crunch was you! - Nonsense. It's true! Look... See? Yeah. Virginie Romanée. That's who I was into. Every boy in school was into Virginie. - She was pure. - Never wore a bra! That was the style. - Who are they? - Don't know. Without party crashers, it's not a party. Anyone crash your birthday? No. Samy, the third musketeer. Wasn't Max number three? No, Samy. He even lent me the book. - Read it? - Uh, yeah. Let's Google them. Got internet here? Are you kidding? I have much better. A war machine! - Minitel? - Yep. Need to pee. Who knew they still exist? You kidding? They're indestructible! Resist extreme temperatures. Pour coffee on them, they still work. One thing I know: the Resistance will form via Minitel. - What do you use it for? - Everything. Phone book, reverse phone book. Everything. I'll Google at home if you don't mind. Joint. No thanks. I quit smoking 10 years ago. This is different. No tobacco. I use tea. Darjeeling. Spicy aftertaste. Try it. Really, no. Loosen up, old fart. Old fart? Is your ball hair all white? Show me. You got old-fart balls! Do they need a walker? Do they watch "Jeopardy"? You got Yoda balls. All wrinkled, with spoiled sperm inside. Seen yourself? Your clothes. Your moped. This maid's room. You short-circuited. Struck by a curse. A curse? Eternally reliving your teens. You're cursed too. Propelled into the future beyond your real age. Look at you! You're like 65! I don't look retarded. I'm off. So long. Yeah, jump ship! Why did I call you? I never left the Titanic! Yes, Brigitte? Someone named Thomas for Mr. Kerbec. Ask what he wants. He has to talk to you. He has a killer idea. I'm busy. Back to work. Still coming for dinner? I have to go, Mom. See you tonight. He's not in. You're so stubborn! He's my pal. I'll just be a minute. I'll be a minute! I saw you! - I saw him. - It wasn't him. Not him? Wake up, asshole! Very well. Same time next week. I saw someone I haven't seen since high school. I thought I'd never see him again. I thought it would make me happy but... In fact it terrifies me. We'll continue this next week. Mr. CEO... His secretary says he's abroad. Quick trip. Beer, honey? No, thanks. We said we'd travel the world. After graduation. But I dropped out. Why are you here? Thomas told me your adventures. I didn't know you did theater. For high school credit. It was a babe hive. We all fought to play Cyrano. We stupidly thought that Cyrano, the hero, bagged all the babes. No sex with that schnoz. We're busy. Can you go? We're not in a rush! "It has no fold, has no gnash, "I carry it, despite you..." What the fuck is it? "Your panache." I'll see you out. Thanks for the beer. I thought about what you said. You're right, I'm cursed! I feel... anachronistic. I got a plan. A killer idea. And I need your help. I take it back. No curse. I am, and so are you. Your wife proved it to me. She asked about you. What were you like? Did you laugh, dance? Cases of accelerated growth can be serious! Cut the crap, Thomas. Remember our oath? When in trouble, one helps the other. We exchanged blood. There was AIDS! - I forget. - A promise is a promise. What is it? Shrimp meringue à la liquid oxygen, tarama powder. An El Bulli recipe. I've taken up molecular cuisine. Reminds me of Chemistry class. It reminds me when Boba Fett freeze-dried Han Solo before giving him to Jabba. Only time I cried at the movies. No, you cried at Lion King, when the father dies. No, I didn't cry then. We had to leave because of your sobs. I just hope you cry like that for me. All well, Edith? Yes, but I won't do like his dad : secret cremation, no way. It didn't make us less sad. You want to bring this up? I didn't find the words then. I regret it. Estelle, in our family we have enormous gaps about the ritualization of death. You see the result. Total denial. I'm not in denial. - Yes. - You are. I just won't discuss it. I want a real funeral. With all the folklore: a wake, chants, funeral march. Major wailing, for sure. Mom, please. - I put it all in a letter. - Stop! Do so too. Death strikes unawares. You know my age? Same as Dad when he died. I shouldn't have brought it up. I'm sorry. Yann saw his friend, Thomas. My little Thomas! Inseparable, remember? A real friend. If you killed someone, he'd have helped you ditch the body. Meaning what exactly? It's an image. Like saying he'd have sprung you from jail. If you said jump into the Seine, he'd jump. Thanks, I get it. Remember that time you had a conjunctivitis full of pus? Eyes stuck together, like a baby mole. Thomas came every day to read to him. At night you told me in detail. Faraway planets, parallel universes, as if you were there. You were crazy for that book. I understood nothing. Total nonsense. Why did the Morlocks take my machine? For I was sure it was them. And if the Elois were the masters, couldn't they get my machine back? Why were they so afraid of the dark? Grottos of the Perigord Dark inside. Bon appétit, buddy!!! Hello? Take out, eat in? So? What's your killer idea? A shindig? A shindig... a party. Like before. Exactly the same conditions: your mom's house, all our friends from the Playboy list. How can it help you? This party will be a sort of portal. The airlock to my escape. Yann, don't laugh. We'll enter a warp, spatiotemporally, and break my curse. A space-time warp? Yep. You've lost it. Know what? It may break your curse too. Stop your premature aging. You'll remember what a real fiesta is like! It won't end at twelve. Thirty. It'll rekindle your inner flame. The office. Yes, Brigitte. Yes, I'm very late. Are you well? No, actually it's because I'm sick. Goodbye, Brigitte. Thanks. That excuse was so lame. Really? He was calmly waiting for the wave. The shark must have confused him with... a turtle or a stingray. It ate half his leg. Thank God for Dad... the wave came and he could surf to the shore. On one foot? He's being repatriated tonight. I was hoping to meet him at the airport... No problem. Take the day off. Go get him. Thanks, boss. Go on. Fucking shark! Fucking surf! Dad has a stump! Cheers. Let's throw the party. Seriously? Like before? Down to a T. - All our friends? - Just like before. At worst, we'll laugh. Not a bit serial killer? Now we just call. Who first? We need music first. DJ Max. Mad Max! Wrong class, dumbass. I know, dumbass. Who the hell are you? It's a challenge. To get into every senior class pic. Freeze and smile! You in? Or scared shitless? Smile! Freeze and smile! Smile! What's up, guys? Mad Max! - Doing okay? - Excellent. - Hey, Max. - Give a hug. You okay? Come on in. Wow, man... a wireless phone! Hands off... No, guys. It's nice of you, but it won't be possible. Dinner whenever, but a party like before would depress me. - You can't say no. - We need DJ Mad Max! DJ Mad Max... I forgot about that. I sold all my equipment. - You sold your LPs? - They took up space. The Velvet Underground banana album that we licked for an acid trip. That was bullshit. It's wasn't. Did you try? Dad, I jammed the photocopier. Shit... Anyone see? I doubt it. Hide in the toilet. Wait for me! My son, our freshman intern. High school freshman? How old? He's... The freshman age. Come over tonight. Okay? I have a surprise. Sure. A surprise! Wait, what can it be? It's a surprise. If I tell you, it's no... - Surprise. - Good! Your brain's bubbling. Think about the party. It won't be the same without you. You're our 3rd musketeer. Samy was the 3rd one. There were four 3 Musketeers. No, just 3. Like the title. Still never read it? Sure I did. Athos, Portos, Mortos... Listen guys, honestly, between us... Not to burst your bubble, but throwing another party... Down to a T. Isn't it regressive? It's better to move ahead. To move ahead, I have to go back. I don't get it. It's just going to be a fun night. Friends, girls. The babes will come! Hot Frago! She slathered her bush with Nutella! That was just a legend. Stop with my nameplate. It goes here. Are you okay? No, I'm not. If some ass from headquarters saw that, I'd lose 4 points. - More if it's dented. You dent it? - No dents. No dents? Let's see. Dented! What a kid! Look at yourself. Bad points, dented nameplates? All serious in your gray suit. Where's Mad Max? Enough with that! Are you dumb? No more Mad Max! Mad Max is over. Dead. Guys... We came to talk about a party. I don't want to party. Hear me? We'll discuss it at your house, tonight. Peekaboo! Frago! Why are you here? It's my home. No way! Why not tell us, dumbass? It was the surprise, dumbass. I have another surprise. Emma! How did we lose touch? Maybe because you dumped me. Forget that? Because you two were together? I thought you knew. Sorry. I didn't, but no prob. I was angry. I didn't understand your reaction. It's history now. You're not alone. My husband just wed an 18 year old. You work or just get dumped? Still the same! Come on... What a pain. At the Observatory. I teach astrophysics and gravitational dynamics. Astrophysics, for real? So come to the party I'm organizing with Yann. What party? In fact you can't come. The party has to be exactly the same as in high school. We didn't know you so you can't come. We need to cause a spatiotemporal shock. Hold on, it's no joke. If you come, it'll screw it all up. A danger for you and us. What is this crap? Did you smoke? Sorry. Where's the wine from? Thomas brought it. Great stuff. - What's this shit? - It's harsh. Why bring this? It's our favorite wine. Is this your favorite, Max? Clos du Cigalou? Are you crazy? This is undrinkable. It's gross! A mix of different wines from the European Union. It just needs to breathe a bit. We should have decanted. Yeah, decanted. We can't decant this crap! We can detrash it! What? I brought 6 bottles. I'd like to know if it's it red or rosé. It negates Hawking's chronology protection conjecture or Novikov's self-consistency principle. Do you follow? To simplify: in order to travel back in time, you must abandon causality, which says effect comes... comes after... After the cause. The cause. It would mean the past hasn't passed. It still exists. It counters the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Sorry but I think your spatiotemporal shock... is a no-go. The only way to relive the past is via memories, or dreams. Can I light it, please? Honey, it used to make you sick. She won't get sick with this. - Big girl now. - We're off. What do you do, Estelle? Hydrological engineer. Embankments of the Seine. Is it really full of stuff? They fished out the remains of a 100-pound python. There are tons of animal carcasses. And human cadavers. Sadly. I didn't want to cast a pall. How did you meet Yann? At a party. I was dancing and he... He was sitting in a couch, watching me. He spent the evening motionless, eyes on me. There was something terribly attractive. A mystery. Something dark. I know what you mean. Tall, dark, twisted. That turned me onto him too. That and his skintight gym shorts. So gross! Remember? Disgusting. You have kids? We'd like to, but it's tough. For some reason, each time I get pregnant... They're not interested. Your friends. - Can't we open up? - Sure! Having my daughter took time. Several miscarriages. You don't even get to bury them. Mourning's impossible. A daughter? Wonderful. What's her name? You really won't talk? No desire to expose our problems at dinner between cheese and dessert. It would do me good. Maybe you too. Absolutely not. You've had enough. Absolutely not. You're embarrassing me, Estelle. This show in front of my friends... is terribly immodest. Show some control. Listen, I can't keep pretending everything's fine, like you. I can't stay. Now I'm the embarrassed one. Goodbye. Excuse me. No problem. Estelle! - Stop. - Please, stay. We're both sad, but separately. Does anyone want a little more... Honey, are you okay? I'm not well. I warned you about this! Look up. Breath, breath... All over. Gross. I said no joint! What's in it? It's just tea. Strong tea, but tea. Not funny, guys. You're pains! How did you end up with Geraldine? At a party... for your 18th birthday. I was mixing. She came up. I tried my luck. I thought she'd blow me off. She had a wild side. Maybe you remember. Did she really wear geisha balls to class? Stop! That's my wife! That was bullshit. Cut it out. Don't get any ideas. We pick up my son and go. It's not... We'll turn it down. Whatever. Excuse me. Dad, why are you here? Picking you up. It's not even twelve! No big deal. I'll wait here. Are you serious? Your son is right. Things get underway at twelve. Except for shitty parties that end at twelve. Thirty. My mistake. Remember that jacket? It belonged to a party animal. Nico, come here. It's my jacket! Mom said I could. Really? - Okay? - Have fun. Cool. Hey. So Max, not tempted? LPs between your fingers? You two never give up! It's too nicey-nice. I like it! My son doesn't need to screw up like we did. Especially like his Mom did. Enough with that! No more jokes! Max, relax. What's got into you? Remember Jacquard? Jacquard spread rumors about Geraldine being an open bar, nympho, geisha balls, Nutella, all that crap. I know the truth. Geraldine told me. One night at a party he gave her shots of tequila. When she was dead drunk... he tried to rape her. We were assholes. We were major assholes. You couldn't know. I tried to find the bastard, to... I looked on internet. No trace. I can try on Minitel, if you want. Minitel doesn't exist anymore. Officially, but... Yeah, too nicey-nice here. Fuck it, guys, I'm back! DJ Mad Max! Get lost. This is shit. Listen up, bud! Let's dance. Don't be a party poop. Come dance! Come on. I'm alive! Are you young? Let's rock this place! Hands, hands, hands... in the air, not up your asses! Estelle. I'm not here. Leave a message. It's me. Listen... I'm... sorry for before. I don't know what got into me. I felt... vulnerable. It's hard to talk about that. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I am the Night Horseman. The eagle of the decks! Mad Max! Mad Max! I'm in! Let's throw that fucking party, guys! I'm in! ! ! ! I'm fucking alive! I'm alive! - What happened? - I'll tell you. Morning! Nico drove you back without a license. That's not all. Come here, Nico. Find it funny? Indelible marker! What will you tell them at work? It was a joke? Very funny. I'm not going like this. Just rub harder. Only laser removes it. Wear a hat. No biggie. A turban, like Sikhs. Sikhs never take off their turbans. And I mean never. - Not on ID cards. - Or at the barber. I read they do grafts with butt skin. Stop, Nicolas! I have a headache. Bunch of Nazis! Bravo, bravo... yeah, laugh! What a great father! Get up. Air out this pigsty! It stinks! Throw away your gyros and plunge the vomit-filled sink! Some is mine but the top layer is yours. Forget that nostalgico-regressive party of yours! It's disgusting here! Shit! Guys... We'll lose touch again. It's wiser. Who cares? We'll continue. You're right. We're like bats. No one tell us we're not birds, so we keep flying. Bats. We continue, but I'll go home and shower. Bats aren't birds? Estelle? Open up, please. If I let you in, it'll be the same as before. And we'll break up. I'll never leave you. Your mother told me. I know everything. Open or I'll knock it down! Please, open up. Continue on your own now. Same clothes after a shower? Shut up. I think she should start over with someone else. Someone to have kids with. Why doesn't it work? She gets pregnant but loses it after 4 months. As kids we thought we were... far removed from death. It makes me dizzy. What do you think comes after? Do you believe in... heaven, hell, all that? Don't you? No, I don't think so. Not in Valhalla either? Valkyries riding wolves of fire? American Indian plains, where all the animals talk. Elvish Grey Havens. The road to Valinor. Kurt Cobain's nirvana... you believe? Yeah... I do believe. Okay. The one good thing about dying... is you finally know. - Sheer madness. - Of course it is! If I don't get them out, they'll die. Every day there are people who die. Braddock! I'm warning you. Watch where you set foot. I set foot where I want. Often on people's faces. Hello, Yann. Go inside, sweetie. He's waiting. Hello, Yann. It's normal to meet again. We never said goodbye. It was to protect you. You protected me. I never saw you sick or dead. You were too young. What do I do now? I can't deal with death. I don't know how. Nothing to do. Besides accept it. Remember when we flew the kite in the park? We managed well together. It went high, very high. You were so amazed. You see? Life and death... they're beyond us. Like kites. We pull the strings, but in fact... it's the wind. Just the wind. Wait. Let it ring more. Please, Dad. So, Virginie Romanée... Where you at, girl? It's Yann Kerbec! We're having a party with Thomas Chevalier. We don't know when but will you come? Great. Bartarin is okay. We need his hash. Can you bring hash? - He never had hash. - What? I'm glad to be here. We've been in school together for 10 years. You never invited me before. It's not just for my hash? Are you crazy? This stuff makes me paranoid. Blow it in! You okay? He did good, my cousin from Perpignan! Do you feel anything? I feel nothing. Nothing at all. You're crazy! You dumb? I never had hash. I had some once, from my cousin. Screw his cousin! We'll call you back. Talk later. No hash, no party. Hi, Virginie, it's Thomas. Thomas Chevalier. In fact we're organizing a party with school friends and I'd like to know if you... Call back. Bye. Take care. Talk soon. You're a real romantic. Wimp... Philippo? Hey, it's Yann Kerbec. Lost track of your daughter? Montaigne High. I bet you don't want to say! Thomas, her old boyfriend. We're having a party. Why not? Would you come? - How dare you? - Your Walkman? His Walkman. Deal? Excellent. Great. We'll call you back. Hello, Natasha, how are you? Thomas Chevalier. I have fond memories too. Great, Lobsta. Talk soon! Keep in touch. Laetitia? Hey, it's Thomas Chevalier calling. We went out during senior year. Tall, dark, muscular.. Leather bracelets. I never puked in your hood! This party will leave us with blue balls. Virginie still has to call back. And... That's all. - Vincent Montluc. - What about him? He's a legend. A chick magnet. Think. If Stud Muffin comes... the babes follow. He'll be our bait. Exactly. Keep us posted. Bye, Vincent. He's thinking it over. Bad sign. That means it's decided. Stud Muffin won't come. He'd have stolen the babes anyway. What babes? There are no babes! That's the problem. He must come. We'll persuade him. We'll go talk to him face to face. He lives here. We can't cross France to beg him! Once there, we'll be close to Samy. Good opportunity. Wait. We can see Virginie too. She's on the way. 3 birds, 1 stone? Bats! - What did you tell your boss? - Nothing! I quit! What did you say? That my mom died. Big one! Jackass! How did she die? On a hike. There was a grizzly bear. It ate her. A grizzly in France? No, in Canada. That's why I took 3 days off. But your mom's stupid. Never go hiking during your period. It attracts grizzlies. Let's see what your moped can do! Faster! Faster! Be cool, officer. It's his mom's funeral. Don't lose it. Don't lose it, man. Forget it. Get moving. Thanks a lot. With asparagus and snails, I suggest a Pouilly Fuissé. Excellent year. You don't have a Cigalou? Brigitte... Aren't you a sommelier? Tell the truth. A grizzly ate my mom. I'm bringing back her body remains. My plane is taking off. For Canada. Thanks. Goodbye. Pouilly Fuissé is fine. And a wedge for the table. It's annoying. Of course. You're neurotic. Find it normal? I can wobble with it. I'll bring it right away. What's in your bag? The tent. I can afford a hotel. We don't need a hotel. Remember when we ran away to live outdoors? Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn? You took a Swiss knife and fishing rod for food. I brought chips and cookies just in case. Huck and Tom. Samy lent us a book. Something dirty. There was a sentence I've never forgotten. "She slowly rouged her lips..." "As if they were the ones on the mouth." Hey, Michel. So your mother was mauled by a wild animal? A grizzly, yeah. She and I just spoke. You kidding? I'm your boss. Don't forget it. Careful, Yann. I can't hear you. Unbelievable. He seems like a pain. Why not fire him? It's not so easy. I don't get it. You're not the boss? I have partners, stockholders... And a deputy CEO, a semi-friend who pisses me off. Semi-friend, semi-traitor. I betrayed you too. - Meaning? - I wasn't there for you. Can I borrow your phone? You're sick! We're free. No one can bother us now. That's freedom? Cutting off contact? We're living an adventure. My private line. Great. - Hello, Mom. - So I'm dead? - I can explain. - You want me dead? I don't at all want you dead. - I have my faults but... - Can I talk? Why dead? What did I do? Fuck this! Dammit. Good job. Seeing her scares me. I was really into Virginie. You never even tried? I figured I had all my life. It had to be the right time. Maybe this is it. - Try. What can you lose? - True. I'll blow her away with my love. Bats... bats! Hello. Who are you? What about you? We're friends of Virginie's. I'm her husband. I bet you left the message. Blast-from-the-past party, right? She wanted to call back. But you left no number. Good job! Stop. Come in! I love the one that loves me. No fault of mine if it's not the same one I love each time. I am... ...what I am. Yann, Thomas and I were childhood friends. Same class each year. Why is he named Thomas like me? He left his mark on Mom. Guess what he did at lunch. He put yogurt on hot dogs! I never did that. What a liar! I remember, but he did worse. It's like a century ago. Last time we spoke was in the last century. But we never spoke. I mean, you never spoke to me. I don't know why they ignored me. When we were 14 or 15, I asked for a pencil sharpener. All I said was: "Can I borrow a pencil sharpener?" They stared at me. They'd obviously heard. They never replied. It was so upsetting. Maybe they were shy. Did I intimidate you? So you couldn't talk? We asked you to parties. You had Vincent Montluc ask me. He'd strut on over and say... "Coming to Yann and Thomas' party?" Then he'd wink and say: "I'll be there". It worked. You came. It'd have worked for you. I was young. I loved whoever loved me. Like in the Prévert poem. Easy. Didn't you play piano? Want to play us something? I don't know if I can. I've forgotten everything. I don't think we ever forget. It stays hidden somewhere. Fuck! Are you crazy? Hey! I feel great. Coffee! We'll take down the tent later. Once it lets up. Actually it's not that bad. It's empty, this time of year. We haven't seen many people. Nope. Once it opens, we'll go inside. It's 5:30. They'll open in a few hours. Time to have... several coffees. If you dream of her, you love her. Think she dreams of me? Know the story of Master Zhuang and the butterfly? - Who? - Master Zhuang. A Chinese philosopher. He dreamt he was a butterfly. Then when he woke up he wondered if he dreamt of the butterfly, or vice versa. So I could be Estelle's dream. Maybe. What about you? Why are you in her dream? How many more miles? At least... 200. You okay? At this speed, it's 9 or 10 hours nonstop. At least! What do we tell Stud Muffin? We'll make him an offer he can't refuse. What offer? I'm joking. That's from The Godfather. Okay. But what's the offer? There is no offer. It was in The Godfather. You mean there's no offer? You're really pretty stupid. It's a line, from a movie. You saw it. We saw it together. "I'll make him an offer he can't refuse." We'll say that? Forget it. Shall we go? - "Friends come too late..." - "And leave too early." Freaky! I know why he's here. He screwed the North and came down south! Don't kid. We have to be serious. It's good to see you guys! Stud Muffin? Think so. You having the party? Yep. Can I come? Why invite you? If I come, all the girls will. Think about it. May I? What's up, girls? How gross! Kerbec and Chevalier! It's crazy. And you haven't changed. But you got... an update. The wind here causes wrinkles. Weight gain and hair loss too? Not sure about the party? You don't want to come? Don't get me wrong. It's not me. I liked your parties. It's my babe. Let me introduce you. Sofia! Come, babydoll. Honey, meet Yann and Thomas. Hello. School friends. They're throwing that party. And you won't invite me. I know Vincent's party plan: hit on every girl. Can't you show a little trust? Come on. You won't regret it. Girls will go wild to see you again. They all asked : "Is Vincent coming?" You mean it? Every single one. I'll find a way. I'll go change. There's... There's something I don't get. You bagged every babe in school. Okay, you were the stud. You were a chick magnet. We got your crumbs. But now... You're ugly, fat, bald... Scuzziest house in Provence. Yet still a chick magnet! Industrial strength! - How? - What's your trick? You give off waves? A magnetic field? Come on, I didn't screw every girl in school. Did I? Yeah, maybe I did. Virginie? Virginie who? Romanée? Don't say her too. I need to know. We made out once at a party. You were there. I remember. It pissed you off. Anyway, I'm sorry. I felt bad about it after, I swear. Now that I'm fessing up... Don't take it bad. It was ages ago. An affair with your mom. An affair? I don't get it. He banged your mom. Not at all. An affair. No sleazy sex thing. A night of love. You kidding? Just thinking about it sets my groin on fire. You banged his mom? Banged my mom? Calm down! Piece of shit! It was love. Let's go. Weird to read out here. What is it? Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I read tons of books. Just finished The Three Musketeers. I read all 3 too. - What? - I'll explain. Samy! - Step back. - We know him. Don't make trouble. Samy! It's us! Come on, guys! How's it going, asshole? How great. Sorry, I didn't recognize you. That sucks for a profiler. Musketeers! How did you get here? Didn't you go to school in... psychology? I did! I have a PhD in social psychopathology. After 4 years of unemployment... I'll take a whiz. I called you a lot. I left messages. You never answered. We all felt guilty. We felt responsible. We also left you messages for the party. Why no answer? I don't think it's a good idea. Our party? Your party... How can I put it? It's a psychodrama that maintains at state of denial. Spare me the shrink jargon, please. I'm perfectly well. Give me a break. Whatever you say. I won't push it. I'm here to talk, if you want. I'll get back to work. See you. Want to dance? How often must I say I don't dance? Come dance, cowboy. We'll have a battle. Stop! Know what I'd like? Of course you do. I need you. Take me, I'm yours. Here? But... Forget them! They're not real. None of this is. But you... Are you real? I'm real if you want me to be. Your choice. What the hell? Beat it! Stop it, honey! Get inside. I'll deal with this! If you touch my wife again, you're dead! It's cool. Don't take it badly. Go on, run back in! Fuck! You can't drive like that. Let's go... We'll sleep on the beach. You have to sober up! Let go of me. I won't! Dream on! You're the one who's dreaming. You! Shit! Fucking garbage! Thomas? Are you okay? This is wild. What? See that light there? Ile du Levant. Where my parents met. On the nudist camp beach. They went back every year. I was even conceived there. Funny, that's where it all began. What is it? Nothing. Tell me! It's weird to imagine. Before ever speaking, you mom saw your dad's dick. Idiot. What about us? Remember how we met? Alone in the schoolyard, leaning against a tree. Autistic, people said. One day I sat next to you. And you said... It's my tree. This tree belongs to no one, cowboy. I mean it. Find another one. What'll you do? Beat me up? Lay off, retard. Don't "retard' me, loser. Don't "loser" me, retard. So what's your name? Yann. Thomas. A swim? Relax, I'm here! We'll keep seeing each other. We won't lose touch. Night, Cowboy. Goodnight. Yann, wake up. Estelle? Wake up. Come to bed now. The number you called has been disconnected... In fact he was assassinated. Kurt Cobain? What bullshit! Max! Have you seen Thomas? No, I haven't. Girls! Have you seen Thomas? Know where Thomas is? Philippo! Have you seen Thomas? Samy! It's too late. Gone already. What's wrong? What is it, honey? Tell me. Honey, what is it? There it is. They planted this tree. And scattered his ashes around it. Everyone was there. Everyone but me. They called to ask me to come. To say how important it was. To say goodbye. It was beyond me. Do you want to dance?
