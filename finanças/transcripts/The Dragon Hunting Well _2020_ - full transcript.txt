Are you all right? Quick! Hang in there. Once we reach the capital we're saved. What... What is this? It's so slimy. I don't know. Let's hurry. Quick, quick! [The Dragon Hunting Well] Zheng, what is this? It's slimy. I don't know either. It's been popping up a lot lately. Slow down. Doctor Sun, don't hurt yourself. Don't worry, I won't. With my skills now, I could go fight a battle, no problem. Let's go. Giddy up! Doctor Sun, I'm a bit confused. Aren't you a doctor? Why do you keep thinking about going into battle? Haven't you heard of the saying? My generation should shoulder the responsibility to revitalize our country. Whether you're a doctor or a butcher, if anyone dares to usurp state power for personal gain, I'll be the first to fight. Doctor Sun, when we enter the exclusion zone in a bit, you must be careful. The people inside are all cursed. What do you mean, cursed? They are infected with a disease. This illness can be cured. Don't believe those evil stories. Zheng! Wait. Are those bats? In broad daylight? Let's leave. Giddy up! Giddy up! Giddy up. Giddy up. Protect us, Goddess of the Well. Protect us, Goddess of the Well. Have mercy, Goddess of the Well. What are they doing? The old psychic of this town is praying to the Goddess of the Well with the others. Back to the right way, clarify inside and out! Begin! Protect us! Goddess of the Well. Seven Stars of the South, guard the earth. Goddess of the Well? It's her who's been protecting this Fog Town for generations. Well, in that case, since this Fog Town was still hit by the epidemic, looks like this Goddess of the Well isn't all that extraordinary. Doctor Sun, don't let the Goddess of the Well hear you. Those people in the exclusion zone, that's her lesson. I don't believe that. I'll tell them to step aside. Doctor Sun, don't! Please forgive us, Goddess of the Well! It ate them! Ate them! Ate them all! It ate them all! Catch him! It ate them all! Who? Ate them all! Don't be scared, everyone. Don't be scared, everyone. The man has been brought under control. We will be even more vigilant, we won't allow anyone else to escape the exclusion zone! Rest assured! Ate them all! Have you found Zhao Ming yet? Not yet. Hurry up. Mayor. I'm Sun Yi Cheng. The higher ups sent me to bring you medical supplies. Doctor Sun, you're finally here. Oh right, Doctor Zuo, come here for a moment. Mayor. Let me introduce you. This is Doctor Zuo, she's in charge of the epidemic prevention work. Good day, Doctor Zuo. I'm Sun Yi Cheng. Okay. Next one. How do I drink this? I'm broke. How is this different from water? Thank you. The mayor is here! Look. Mayor, what, what, what is that you have there? Why is You San here? Says he's here to help out, but actually he's here to get free meals. Mayor, just ignore him. What do you mean, ignore him? During these trying times, anyone and anything must be taken seriously. Folks, everybody! This is Doctor Sun from the provincial capital. He brought us medicine and medical supplies. Everyone, you must have faith. Have faith! It's everyone's good fortune to have such a good mayor like you. Saving lives is important. But look, you're already here, right? So why not give us a little something to eat or drink? Look at this porridge, there's nothing but water. We'll starve to death before we're even cured. Don't you think so, guys? Yes. Doctor Sun, come here for a moment. Leave, leave. Thank you, Mayor. Wear this mask, come with me. Ate them all! Hurry! Ate them! The sedative. Ate them. Ate them! Ate them all! Ate them all! What are you doing? Ate them all. Forget it, I'll do it. Hold him down. Hurry! Ate them all! Ate them all! Ate them all! Ate them! Ate them! Ate them all! Are you sure you're a doctor? Of course I am, but my medical skill isn't as good as yours. You can be irresponsible about yourself, but this is about life and death, don't treat patients as a joke. Hold him. What is this bulge? Mayor. We found this in Zhao Liang's arms. Why... Why is there an arm? Mayor, Captain Li, please tell me, what happened to Zhao Liang? He and his brother Zhao Ming handle the corpses in this town. Both brothers got infected. They escaped the exclusion zone three days ago. We found Zhao Liang, but Zhao Ming... So... So this arm was Zhao Ming's? It's very possible. It seems like this arm got torn out by a wild animal. Mayor. Are there any large wild animals around here? We need to ask Hunter Zhang for that. Doctor Zuo. Help me. Okay. Hunter Zhang! Hunter Zhang! Sister! Shan Shan. Sister, Sister! Shan Shan! Don't hug people when you're still sick! It's fine. Shan Shan. Hunter Zhang, I need your help with something. Come with me. Sister. I was very good and took medicine. My cough is getting much better. Really? Let me see. Sister, am I healthy again? You are getting much better. Be sure to take your medicine. You'll definitely get healthy again. I will, Sister. Who are you? Are you a doctor, too? Yes. No. He's a delivery man. Nice to meet you, Uncle Delivery Man. Shan Shan. Go back inside. - Bye, Sister and Uncle. - Bye. How did it go? Do we know what animal it was? We don't know what it is yet, but I can guarantee this place is safe. Thank you. The mayor just reminded me, the patients just arrived in this exclusion zone, their mood is still unstable. So as not to cause panic and affect their treatment, I think we should keep quiet about the beast for now. Doctor Zuo, I'll head back now. I leave this place to you. You can count on me. Doctor Zuo, I delivered all the supplies, I'll head back to the capital now. You can't. What is this? From now on, you'll record your temperature once every hour. Why? You were in close contact with a patient without wearing a mask. You could have been infected. So, you need to stay here for observation, until incubation period has passed. How long is the incubation period? You're a doctor too, you don't know? I know. Of course I know. Doctor Zuo, what are these patients infected with? We aren't sure yet. This type of disease is very rare. Other than showing symptoms of fever, coughing up blood and dyspnea, black spots will grow on their skin. And... has anyone been cured? No. No cure has yet been found. But the good news is the spread of the epidemic has been controlled. Nice rifle. Be careful with it. Thank you. To be honest, this is the first time I'm holding the real thing. Bang! Bang! A hit! I need to talk to you. It's been twelve hours. Where's the chart? Chart? What chart? You mean temperature chart. I have it. I wrote them all down. Twelve hours, I recorded them all. Where is it? I lost it. It's this one, isn't it? Yeah, that's it. You can't handle sedatives, you don't know the incubation period, you even drop your temperature chart without any care. Even if you don't think about yourself you need to think of others, don't you? Doctor Sun Yi Cheng. I wish you didn't have contact with patients. That way, you could leave sooner. Doctor Zuo. How much longer does the medicine need to cook? It's almost done. Okay. Bring it to them when it's done. Okay. Here. Time for medicine. Doctor Zuo. Here. How are you? Feeling better today? Still the same. It's okay, you need to be patient. You will get better. Brother. You should go. What if I get you infected? You'll have to die too. Brother, here. Doctor Zuo is thinking of a way, isn't she? You need to have faith in her. Your illness can definitely be cured. I know what you're thinking. There are food and drink available here, you want to make me leave so you can have them all for yourself, right? Forget it. It's so damn cold. Zhang. Add firewood. Why don't you go? I'm telling you to go. Stop wasting time. I'm gonna beat you up! What beating? Take your medicine. Go! I'm so unlucky. Sharing a room with a gangster. Why is Zhang taking so long? I'll go take a look. Go. Where is Zhang? Little brat, did you see Zhang? I didn't. - Shan Shan, quick! - Dad! What's going on? Go, go check. There's nothing there. Nothing? Dad! Dodge! Dodge! Run! Run! Run! Hurry! Grab them! Ate them. Ate them! Brother! Xiao Xiao! Run! Don't go there! Stop staring! Hurry! The door is locked! Open up! Xiao Xiao! Open the door! Where is the key? The key! Hurry! Get the key! Open the door quickly! Without mayor's orders, no one may leave! There's no time for this! Out of the way! Hurry! Hurry! Run! Run! Quick! Run! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run! Run! Go! Hurry! Run! Don't come over! Sister! I'll kill you! Don't go over there! Don't go over there! Don't comer over! Come back! Come back! Don't come over! Dad! Doctor Sun. Doctor Zuo, are you alright? I'm fine. How is everyone? What are we going to do now? That monster can come out any time! Any time! Yes, what do we do? It's a wolf that found its way here to a sheep pen. We're going to die! Since this clinic is dangerous, we should return to town. Yes, yes, yes. Let's go back to town. Go, go, go! No! You can't go! You can't go back to town! Captain Li. Why is that? The ones who are healthy can go, the patients can't. If they return to town, the people there will be in danger. You are saying the people in town are people but these patients are not? Yes, yes! Do you need to ask? Isn't it obvious? Patients are the locked off sheep. Stop this bullshit! Tell us then. We asked you a question. He can't say a single damn thing. You can't say it? Then I will! When the mayor transferred everyone here from town, curing you was never on his mind. What do you mean? That old thing? He's afraid you will infect others if you stay in town! If you want to go back now, of course Captain Li wouldn't let you. Captain Li, is he telling the truth? Tell us, Captain Li! - Stop asking. - Tell us! He'll become mute from all your questions. I'm gonna shoot you! Shoot me. If you got the guts, shoot right here. If you don't shoot your gun today, I'll look down on you. Do you think I wouldn't dare? Calm down! Let us out! Tell us! Go back, go back. Don't worry, people. Even though this disease is a big threat to us, there's still hope for us. Let's ask Doctor Zuo, see if there's a way to keep it from spreading and allowing us to go. There is. This kind of disease is transmitted mainly by saliva droplets. Masks can effectively cut off the infection. It's usually us who wear masks to take care of patients, we only need to reverse it, let the patients wear masks and it can have the same effect. What if it doesn't work? There is no what if. You San, Brother Zhang and we others who help out in the exclusion zone are not infected. We are the best proof. That's right. She's right. Captain Li. That monster isn't necessarily just running around here. What if it goes to town? I think we should go to town quickly and tell them. So they can prepare themselves. Come on. - Let's go tell them. - Stop talking. Take the mask. Yes. Take it. Wear them. Come. All of you, wear them! Come. Wear it. Wear them. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you. Here you go. What did you say? Speak louder. Here. For you. I said, hurry up. Here. Wear it. Thank you, Sister. Here. Who else didn't get one? This thing is so gross. That... Where did those weird things come from? Who knows? My garden got surrounded by those things. Oh no! Oh no! Look, I just fetched this water from the well. It's already turned black. It's so scary. That... Calm down, people. Calm down, people. Let us listen to what the psychic has to say. Yes, yes! Yes, yes. Looks like we still don't have the Goddess of the Well's forgiveness. The well water turning black... What do we do? Such cold and bleak things are growing. And those cursed people. Why has the Goddess of the Well still not calmed her anger? Right. The Dragon Well is the dwelling place of the Goddess of the Well. We have to be careful and pious and worship her. Did you worship her? There is never enough incense. It's a great gift already that the Goddess of the Well hasn't cursed you yet! It seems that the Goddess of the Well will be angry for a while. I need to make my ritual a few more times. Er... Thank you, Psychic. I will pay you the money. Mayor! Bad news! The people who the Goddess of the Well cursed have returned again! Don't let them in! Don't let them in! Stop! Stop! You can't come in! Stop! Go back! I'll tell the mayor. Mayor. Li Kuang, how useless are you? Mayor, you don't know, that wasn't a wild animal, it's a monster! What? A lot of patients got eaten by it! Impossible. A monster? Monster? What monster? What nonsense. Go away. I'll settle this with you later. What monster? Don't believe them! Liar! Doctor Zuo, Doctor Sun, what are you doing? Mayor, a monster came- Doctor Zuo, I welcome the patients coming back, but you need to cure them first, right? They can only get the best treatment in the exclusion zone. Right? Look at this place, there's no medical equipment whatsoever. How do we cure them? Really, you two doctors, you should take the patients back to the exclusion zone. Don't worry, Mayor. we brought everything with us. Yes, Mayor. The disease isn't spreading anymore. Also, the patients are all wearing masks. They won't infect you! Patients? Who is a patient? These people... These are the people the Goddess of the Well cursed! Whoever gets close to them will be unlucky! And suffer! Don't you know? The water from the well has turned completely black. And this wall, this ground they are covered in wet and slimy, cold and bleak stuff. This is the curse of the Goddess of the Well! Right! Nonsense! He's right! It's the epidemic. If it's a disease it can be cured. The epidemic? It's a disease and can be cured? Well, well, well, let's ask this female doctor, she's been here for half a year, who has she cured? Yes! Yes, right! She didn't cure anyone! It's a lie! Old man. Let's say they are cursed. But now there's a man-eating monster at the exclusion zone. Our good mayor, you can't just watch the patients die, can you? Damn! What monster? I know what that is! That's a divine creature! The Goddess of the Well's divine creature is here to punish those who disrespect her! Right! That's right! You are a bunch of bastards! Stop harming people here! Why do the patients have to die? It's death either way you look. You San, you are just a little thief, don't act like the good guy. Jiang! Just you wait, I'll slit your tongue! Enough! Enough! Listen to me! The patients should go back to the exclusion zone for now. We will take precautions, and stop those wild animals, monsters or whatever. We'll ensure everyone's safety! Mayor, I know you are worried about everyone's safety. But there really is a monster at the exclusion zone. I guarantee you, I guarantee no one will be infected, okay? Listen to my advice, alright? Wait till the divine creatures have punished the people in need of punishment and the world will be at peace again. You! Dad! Look, what is that? What? The monster is back. What is that? What is it? A monster? Run! Protect the mayor! Run! Don't panic! Run! Don't panic! The divine creature has shown itself! Hurry! Go! Sun Yi Cheng! Go! Go! Go! Dad! Shan Shan! Dad! Dad! Shan Shan! Hurry! Dad! Shan Shan! Save me! Over here! Go! Inside! Okay, okay. Shopkeeper! Shopkeeper! Open up! Open the door! Run! Mayor! Don't move! No one move! The monster is here! It senses us through vibration! Don't move! Come back, you two! Don't go over there! Hurry! Don't move, don't! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Shan Shan! Bastard! Come here! Your master is here! Come here! Bastard! Come here! Come on, bastard! Listen to me! When I tell you to stop, you stop! Stop! Sister! Don't act so tough. You should just tell me if you're worried about me. Go easy on me. Shan Shan. Don't be scared. Be a good girl. Here. How are you? Doctor Zuo. You alright? In the blink of an eye, only a few dozen people are left of this entire Fog Town. I regret not listening to you sooner and making precautions. Now you regret it. What the hell were you doing before? Hunter Zhang. Hunter Zhang! Think of a way quickly! How do we deal with that monster? Everyone saw that the monster move underground. It needs to sense the vibration of the ground to determine the prey's location before it attacks. Every attack counts. Yes. This monster has thick skin, bullets are nothing to it. How do we guard against it? Alright, Mayor, since the monster isn't here right now, how about we leave Fog Town as soon as possible and find help in the provincial capital? That's the only thing we can do now. Hurry, hurry. Go. Hurry. Hurry. Why are they running so quickly? Keep up. Hurry, keep up! Hurry! Hurry, keep up! Hurry, hurry! Hurry, to the boat! Stop them! Don't move! Don't come over! Don't come over! Back off! Back off! What are you doing? Put the guns down! Put the guns down! Put the guns down! Put them down! Li Kuang, what the hell are you doing? These are people who were cursed. If we bring them we will all die! How many times have I said it? They aren't cursed, they only got infected. They are all wearing masks. You will all be fine! Doctor Zuo is right! Mayor! Mayor! Don't move! Let us get onto the boat! Talk to them. They listen to you. I'm sorry, Doctor Zuo. The ones cursed by the Goddess of the Well are not allowed on board. You don't believe they are patients, either? I've never believed that! Mayor! Looks like You San was right. That old thing never thought about curing the patients! All you wanted was to lock these so called cursed people inside the exclusion zone! Ask all of us, if even one of us stands up and says that they are patients, then you may all get on board! Don't blame me. Everything I do is for Fog Town. As long as we live, Fog Town still lives! Fog Town is a century-old town. It must not be ruined in my hands! Li Kuang. Whoever dares to come closer, shoot them! Ready the boat! Wait! I wasn't cursed. I want to get on board. Xiao Xiao. They are your patients. What are you doing? Sis, I'm sorry. I just want to live. You are a doctor! Sis. I am a doctor, but I'm also an ordinary person. All of you who aren't cursed, who else wants to get on board? Dad. Dad. Doctor Zuo, Doctor Sun. We aren't leaving. You San! And you? You bastard, you scum! Get lost! You good-for-nothing! Set sail! Yes, sir! Get on board! Don't move! Don't move! Not good! The monster is here! The monster is here! Hurry! Run! Everyone, run! Quick! Run! Hurry! Go! Go! Run! The boat is gone! The boat is gone! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Tell me, where in Fog Town is a place with the hardest foundation? I know. I know. Quick! Hurry! Right here. Hurry! Hurry, hurry, keep up! Quick! Quick! Go, hurry! Hurry! - Hurry! Keep up! - Hurry inside! Be careful! Get inside! Be careful. This church was built by foreigners. Mr. Jiang bought it after it was abandoned and uses it as his restaurant's storeroom. The foundation here is the hardest. Should be no problem. How about this, let's close that door quickly! Okay. Hurry! Move! Captain Li, take a few people, check if there are other entrances. Okay. Let's go. Help me out here. What are you waiting for? Help me out! Doctor Sun. Are you hungry? No. Brother Zhang, don't you find it strange? The monster at the dock just now didn't eat anyone. Animals are different from humans. They hunt for survival. They don't kill and hunt in excess. If I guess right, this monster must be a mutation of some kind of animal. It can burrow into the ground and swim in water, what could it be? It's over. The boat is destroyed, there is a who-knows-what kind of monster. If you ask me, The whole island is a big sheep pen. We don't understand the monster's behavior. We know even less when it will strike again. Looks like we need to find a way out of Fog Town soon. Doctor Zuo. Here. Ever since the monster appeared I haven't stopped moving. The chart isn't very complete. Is it of any use? Congratulations, you passed the incubation period safely. That's great! Now I feel much more at ease. What are you thinking about? Sun Yi Cheng, the way out has been blocked by the monster. Staying here forever is not an option. So we'll find some people to lead away the monster as the last resort. The others take this chance to escape. But who would want to lead away the monster? They may not be able to come back. It is human nature to show one's cowardly side in the face of death. I don't blame her. You are talking about Gao Xiao Xiao. But you, it's like you have overcome human instinct. When it is the most dangerous, you don't think of yourself but your patients. Because I'm a doctor. Do you know what's more scary than monsters? Not being able to see hope. Doctors are the patients' hope. So even if the whole world abandons them, I have to stay with them. Do you know why I wanted you to leave in the beginning? Why? Because I hate quacks. They have absolutely no reverence for life. What about now? What kind of person do you think I am now? Still a quack. But... a good person. I feel like you don't really want to be a doctor. Right. If it weren't for my parents, I wouldn't have gone abroad to study medicine. What do you want to do? Actually, my dream is to fight on the battleground. Wherever my country is in danger, I'll be there. I'll be a real hero. It's really childish and laughable, don't you think? Why? Like what you're doing now, doing your best to protect the people around you, that's being a hero. I told you, there was a smell. See? Mr. Jiang is really sly. He sells bad-quality wine in his Jiang Ji Restaurant. All that damn good wine is here. Brother. Are you really going to talk about that matter? If you really do it'll be all over with our reputation. Brother. Compared to so many people's lives, reputation is worth nothing. You have inadvertently done what you wanted to do. But after working so hard for so long, I still haven't succeeded in what I wanted to do. You're talking about this epidemic? I've been in Fog Town for a few months now. But I couldn't cure them. Even if there is only one person... If only one person... If only one person could recover, the villagers wouldn't be like they are now, believing in ghosts and gods. We wouldn't have ended up here. I believe in you. Doctor Zuo! Look quickly! Sister. Shan Shan. Let me see. Open your mouth. Shan Shan! Shan Shan! Do you know you've recovered, Shan Shan? Really, Sister? Brother Zhang, she's cured! Great! Let's tell everyone quickly. Daddy, I'm cured! This disease can be cured. Come. Let's go. Everyone, come here! Come here! Everyone, come here! I have something important to tell you all! Everyone! Listen to me. Listen to me first. Shan Shan's illness, she's already- Everyone, don't move! Don't panic. The foundation is solid. We... are safe. The mayor is here. Don't worry, we're safe. I'm fine. Don't move! This isn't a solution. Brother. Maybe we should move a bit, and try it? What is it doing? It's scenting. You San! Dodge! You need to hide! Run! Hurry! This way! Hurry! Go, go, go! Run! Run! Sun Yi Cheng! Doctor Zuo! Don't come over! Shan Shan. Don't shoot. It'll attract it. We'll be the one screwed! Shan Shan! Brother! Brother, don't go there! Let go! Hurry! Go! Go quickly! Go, go quickly! Brother Zhang! Dad! Dad! Go! Hurry! Over there! Go! Go, go, go! Hurry! Go! Go! Daddy! Hurry! Daddy! Dad! Daddy! Mayor. Daddy! Come quickly! Come! Come! Come quickly! Hurry! Go! Quick! Go! Brother, go quickly! Go! Hurry! What are you doing over there? Come help us! Hurry! Daddy! Quick, quick, quick! Hurry! Go, go! Go! Brother! Hurry! Pull, pull, pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Brother! Brother! Brother, don't let go! Let go! Brother, you were right. Compared to people's lives, reputation is worth nothing! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! He's here. Anyone there? Anyone there? Anyone there? Where is Xiao Xiao? Where is Xiao Xiao? Did you see Xiao Xiao? Mayor! Shan Shan. Did you see Xiao Xiao? No, I didn't. Xiao Xiao. Don't let it enter the hole! Everyone, help! Go, hurry! What do we do? With the fire so large, we'll be burned to death if we stay! Try to get out quickly! Come here quickly! Go! Hurry! Go! Why did you stop? Where... Where are we going? No matter where we go, the monster will catch us. In all of Fog Town, there is no place for us to stay. We'll go to the provincial capital. To the provincial capital? Our boat is gone! It's not like you didn't see it! There is a secret cave at the bottom of the cliff to the northwest. We'll make it outside if we walk along the cave. If we're outside, things are easier. A secret cave? I hunted all my life in the mountains, I never once saw a secret cave. You San. What nonsense is this? It was me who stole Mr. Jiang's emerald vase. You San. At this point, don't talk about useless things, okay? Half a year ago, I sneaked into his house and stole that emerald vase. Later when his servants came after me, I stumbled and fell down the cliff. I found the secret cave. Not only Mr. Jiang's house. I've stolen from many people's houses in this town. Bronze items from Yang Lao San's house, paintings from Wang Chang Shui, and your gold lock, I stole that too. I transported these things using the secret cave. But You San... That's right. Im a thief. I'm a thief! I'm a thief. But today I and my brother, we will take you outside. If you believe me, come with me. Lead the way. Go. Okay. Hold the torches. The cave is very deep and complicated. Stay close. Go. Where did these bones come from? They weren't here before. You San. You found this place half a year ago? Guys, guys. We, we should go quickly. Wait. Doctor Zuo, when did the epidemic start in the town? Half a year ago, the disease started to spread in Fog Town. Three months ago a large number of patients suddenly died. You are saying... These are the bones of the patients? Mayor. Mayor! Didn't I say the bodies need to be buried deep below the soil? How could you dispose of them so carelessly? It'll increase the spread of the disease, don't you know? You old thing. What the hell did you do? What... What did I do? Everything I did was for Fog Town! These people... These people... They were all cursed by the Goddess of the Well! And that's why you told Zhao Ming and Zhao Liang to throw the bodies in here? Yes! Yes, so what? I told them to throw them in here. Didn't the old psychic say? They mustn't be buried under soil! They will pollute this land! They will cause the Goddess of the Well to become even more incensed! If that happens, Fog Town will be struck by even greater disaster! The epidemic has already taken their lives. They have suffered from the disease. After their death they couldn't find a resting place. I understand now. All of this was because you were bewitched by feudalistic superstition! They were only sick, but superstition delayed their treatment! Ultimately, it was all because of your ignorance that caused this tragedy! Impossible! Impossible! This is a curse! Not an illness! It's not a disease! Mayor! If these people were cursed by the Goddess of the Well, why is Shan Shan cured? Look. Shan Shan is cured! She's cured? How can it be? I don't know. Speak! This... This is an illness. This is an illness. You old fool! Give me my brother back! - Give me my brother back! - You San! Calm down! - I'll kill you! - You San! - I'll kill you no matter what! - You San! This is an illness. You bastard! This is an illness. You old fool! Who do you think you are, you old thing? Calm down, calm down! Who are you? Calm down. I only had this one brother! You old fool! The monster! Oh no! The monster is here! - Go! - Dad! Go! Go! Hurry, go! Hurry, hurry! Go! Monster. Mayor! Mayor! Go, Mayor! Mayor! Hurry, hurry, go! Hurry! Go! Go! - Go, Go! - Dad! Go! Hurry! Hurry! Run! Go! Keep up! Li Kuang! Dad! Go quickly! - You need to survive! - Dad! Let go! Go! Hurry! I think it can't find us. Why? Perhaps it's this strange plant and the slimy secretion. This smell is affecting its sense of smell. If we stay here, it will find us sooner or later. Do you remember what I said we should do as the last resort? I'll lead it away. You head to the exit. If you go, you won't come back. I knew you care about me. Don't worry. If I survive, I will come find you. - Doctor Sun. - Dad. Doctor Zuo. Thank you for curing Shan Shan for me. I, Zhang Miao, can never repay you for it. This was your mother's. Keep it. Dad, don't! No need to thank me. I'm not doing it for you. Bastard! Your master is here! Take care of Shan Shan! - Daddy! - Go! Daddy! Daddy! You San! Take this! - Dad! - Go! - Daddy! - Go! Hurry! Sister. They will be fine. Come. You San! Quick! Go! Go! This way. Monster. It can smell the blood on me. You two, hurry, go quickly. What are you saying? Go. Go! Shut up! You San. We've come this far. If we die, we die together. If we make it, we make it together! Brother. I'm coming. Cover me. Come on! Come here! Doctor Sun! Doctor Sun! I'm here. Shan Shan. Shan Shan! - Daddy! - Shan Shan! Daddy! You're finally back! I told you, I will come back to find you.
