Keep the dust and junk off it, right? Well, I guess it could work. How come you never take Gloria out of her case? Oh, man. Holding that guitar brings back a whole lot of memories... both happy and sad. Maybe I should come up with a name for my guitar. That is, when I get it. Yeah, you got ten minutes before school starts. -You ready to rock? -Yeah. [laughing] Hey, they gonna do some rocking here this morning. Yeah.

Used to make some of the worst times in my life a lot easier to take. -That's for sure. -[bell ringing] Ah, time to go to school. Ah, Ray, couldn't we just forget to show up? It's the day before Christmas break. All we're going to do is watch videos. Oh, come on, I mean, just because you in rock club, doesn't mean you can skip class. Hell, you're trying to get this old guy in trouble? Okay, okay. You can come back at recess. I'll give you one last lesson before break. I'll be here.

No one's going anywhere in this. I know, but I can't just sit here. Seriously? You're going to go outside in that? I think it's very cool that you're worried. How can I help? Uh... Okay. I have an idea. We're going to do what we came here to do in the first place. Stupid. Okay. There's no homes, nothing inside. Just the woodshed and the barn. -It's locked, but... -I know.

I'll go. -[Ray] Any last words? -Yeah, how about shut up? -You know... -Don't say a word! I'm so sorry. Go. [groaning continues] It's just the wind. It's only the wind. It's only the wind. Oh, holy moly crap! [heavy breathing] Okay, that wasn't... There aren't any... [groaning gets louder] [groaning continues] [high-pitched scream] -What was that? -Don't worry about it.

[Heather] I'm coming. -Come on. Okay, you ready? -Yeah. Okay. Giddy up! Giddy up! Giddy up! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Ha-ya! Ha-ya! Honey, are you sure they use goats for sleighs? I don't know, honey. I'm not sure of anything. -Do I look like a goat rancher to you? -No. -What do people even buy goats for? -Milk. [softly] Oh, man. It's okay. [car approaching] -Do you hear that? -I do. Oh my gosh, it's a car. It's a car! [laughing and cheering] ♪ ...or two ago I thought I'd take a ride ♪ -Stop! -Stop! ♪ Pa pa pa... ♪ What? -Stop! -[Pete] Stop! Oh, we are so glad to see you. What are you guys doing out here in this weather? Could you please help us with a ride? Our daughter's all alone. Come on in. Thank you so much. Come on Jett, let's go. [humming] Hey, you guys mind if I stand up for a minute? This old back of mine doesn't handle sitting too well anymore. Yes, I do mind. What are you doing? He is our prisoner. [Ray] Hey, thanks. -Do you know what your problem is? -No. You're soft, Ned. Your will is soft, so is your brain, so is your... body. Well, maybe you're right, Barbi. I wonder what's taking Rico so long. You poked me real hard. I can't stand the thought of Izzy waiting outside in this cold. Honey, we're gonna be there very soon. I know. -Are we terrible parents? -No. No, really, are we? I mean, we forget about Izzy's stuff all the time. It's not just once in a while. It is all the time. Honey, we're working. -So what? That's not an excuse, honey. -Both of us are working. You know, I mean sometimes things are gonna fall through the cracks. Yeah, our kids. Falling through the cracks into an abyss of Mom and Dad not being there. You know what? We used to do stuff together as a family. And now we do everything apart. -We really do. -Yeah. I feel like we are losing touch with Izzy. -And Nick. -You know, why don't, from now on... let's start being a real family. I-- we have to. We really need to take the time. Chris, thank you so much for helping us out. Yeah, thank you. You know, this isn't really any of my business, but I've got a feeling your girl's just fine. Okay, something is wrong, Barbi. -Rico should be back by now. -He will be back soon enough. [sound of chains] What was that? -That sounded like... -Like chains. Yeah. Oh, no, he's come back. Who? Who's come back? The worst of them all. Um, Clarkson. That-- that's what it is. [softly] Cla... Lewis Clarkson. He died in his chains. As-- as cold of a man as there ever was. He stole the last meal of a man headed to the electric chair. Oh... Yeah, let's just hope he-- he doesn't-- he doesn't get to your missing friend, old Lewie. -What? -Don't-- don't listen to him. You... shut it. What will happen? He's dead. -What? -[Ned] You look worried. I am not worried one bit. I should be in Acapulco! I don't believe this. Not for a single second. You're right. Probably nothing. Barbi, can we please just get out of here? No. Okay, fine. I'll go check it out. -And can I just say one thing? -No. He collects jewelry, rings, necklaces, things like that. If you feel something cold on your throat, -just... -Keep him quiet. Can I-- can I make a point? -Is it a ghost observation? -You're not... very much like your sister. No, she's assertive, I guess. I mean, you're not soft. I mean, you're just a... a nice person. -Thank you. -You don't like to hurt people. You don't like stealing from the poor. Are you sure you're cut out for this? Yes, I am a robber, Ray. This is easy to fix. Well, I disagree. Oh, look, I've made mistakes in my life. I followed others, you know? And then one day, what happens? I end up in prison. -In prison? -Yeah. But... believe me, it's something you don't want to experience. Every minute the world gets further and further away from you. In the end, what prison takes of you... costs more than what you stole is worth. [Ned sighs] The money. Come out, come out, whoever you are. [struggling] [Izzy] Jett, come on, help me! [Barbi] All right, open this door! Right now! -[Izzy] Two down. -Open this door! The noise has stopped. Maybe it's satisfied. There were never any ghosts in here, were there? Yeah, you got more to be afraid... in your two partners than any ghost in this place. -Hey, they-- they're not so... -Ned... I've had two miracles in my life. The first was discovering the guitar when I was in prison. Without it, I don't know what I'd be now. Maybe in a cell next to the one that's-- that's gonna be for you. And the other miracle was when I found someone who saw the part of me I thought was long gone. And she was a singer in a band that I auditioned for. We became friends and... and then, more than that and... eventually, she married me. Her name was Gloria. She passed away about five years ago. Why-- why are you telling me all this? Because you need to know that there's a life worth living on the other side. [Heather] I am so sorry for us laying that guilt trip on you. Oh, don't you worry about that. You know, I'm something of a student of human nature. I know who's naughty and I know who's nice. Wow, that sounds like something in a fortune cookie. Maybe that's where I heard it. -We ready? -[David] Yeah. I've programmed the school's GPS coordinates. And it looks like the blizzard stopped. So that should give you clear visibility on the way there. We'll be watching, but... the drones will fly on autopilot until they reach the school. Then they'll land themselves. Perfect. You think this will work? I hope so. -Good luck, Nick. -Thanks. When all this is over, you and I should go fly drones sometime. Yeah, we should uh-- we should do that. Okay. All right. Here we go. -It works! -It works! It works! Okay, okay. I'm next. Whooo! He's doing this. Let's go, Nick! Whooo! [Barbi grunts] [stumbling] [Barbi] Where is my stupid phone? Come on, come on, pick up the phone, you moron. [cell phone ringing] Rico Sanders, personal bodyguard to the stars. -Rico! -Barbi? It's not a ghost, you idiot. It's a kid! Okay, okay, I'm coming. [Barbi] Really? Go check on Ned. I don't trust him. -Where are you going? -I'm going to end this nightmare. Babe? [laughing] Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! [grunts] Ouch! Ow! [groans] So, are the knots too tight? I'll manage. [softly] Cool... But you can solve all that by just letting me go, Ned. Ray, I ca... My sister... Okay, we can just tell them that you escaped, and then if they catch me, then I'll just pretend like you knocked me down or something. -[Rico] What do you think you're doing? -Rico. I'm-- I can't do this, okay? This is wrong. I should have never let you guys talk me into it in the first place. [Barbi on speaker] Attention, students. This is your principal speaking and I am here to give a message to the little creep responsible for all the games we've been playing today. The games are over and I have won... because I have something you want. So if you want your friend back in one piece, then you better give me my money back. Oh, and you have five minutes. And believe me when I tell you that what's his name? Ray? Well, Ray is gonna lose big time. The clock is ticking. Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. I hate kids. I hate kids! What's going on here? I caught your brother here trying to let the janitor go. I should have known I couldn't trust you. You've always been such a disappointment. Always questioning me when I ask you to do something. Always whining... [in childish voice] about not wanting to hurt innocent people. So as of right now, you are no longer my brother. Best news you had in a long time, Ned. What are we going to do about this reject? [sighs] Same thing as we always planned to do. Just a little sooner. And what exactly is that? You'll find out soon enough, both of you. [laughing] Well, it looks like your friend cares more about money than you. My kind of people. [Izzy] You're wrong. Izzy, run! Run! [Barbi] There you are. You want to make a deal? I'll give you your money. Just let Ray go. Listen here, you little brat! I am through playing games with you. So you take me to my money right now or things are gonna get nasty! Just take me, but don't hurt her. Oh, wouldn't you like that? Move. [Chris] We are almost there. Good. You know, you look really familiar, Chris. Do I? Where are you from? I'm from up north, way up north. Can I ask you a question? What? Does it bother you, stealing from poor people, especially this time of year? What does the time of year have anything to do with it? When somebody has something I want, I take it. Geez, where'd you get an attitude like that? Didn't your parents teach you anything? Parents? Never had much use for parents. Speaking of, where are yours? They get busy sometimes. Busy? Busy is just an excuse. Busy is something they tell us when they have more important things to do. Congratulations, kid. You just learned one of life's most disappointing lessons. Well? Hey, Rico, I guess now that Barbi has disowned me as her brother, I can tell you what I really think of you. This ought to be good. Go ahead. Well, quite frankly, I don't like you. And I never have. And I never did. And you're a bad guy. You are-- you're also an awful person. So... Oh wow, that-- that really hurt. How will I ever go on? Is that it? No. I have one more thing to tell you. Hmm, can't wait. What is it? You're really good at tying people up. Not. [screams] Let me show you how to tie a real knot. [grunting] [Barbi] All right, enough of the life lessons, kid. -Where's my cash? -[Izzy] Right up here. But there's one thing I have to say. Do I have to hear this? Sure, my parents are busy, but they're not out having fun and messing around. They're working hard to take care of me and my brother. Ooh, that is a very, very touching story, kid. But stop stalling and tell me where my money is. Oh, I wasn't stalling you, I was distracting you. -From what? -Her. [growling] I would probably let go of me very slowly. This is Jett. She also loves me. But, as you can see, she doesn't like you very much. So if I were you, I'd just stand there till I get back. Good girl. Where are you going? Get back here! Good dog. Good dog. -[snarling continues] -Shh. Would you eat a cookie? Do you want a cookie? Good girl. Good girl. Cookie, cookie. -Izzy, you all right? -Yeah. I'm sorry about lying to you about my parents coming, but... Wait, aren't you a bad guy? Not anymore. It's a long story. Where's Barbi? Jett's guarding her. Come on. -Oh, all right. -Yeah. [Pete] Okay, let's go get her. -[Heather] Okay. -You guys check the front. -I'll go take a look out back. -Okay. -Thank you. -Thank you, Chris. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas to you, too. -[Pete] Merry Christmas. All right, come on, honey. Izzy! Jett, you let Barbi get away -for some cafeteria cookies? -[Ray] Oh, shame on you. This dog will walk over my dead corpse for a Milk-Bone. So, where is my ex-sister? Oh, hey, hey! Excuse me. Have you seen our daughter, Izzy? That's your daughter? [laughing] Good luck, buddy. That was weird. -Who is she? -I don't know. Okay. Ice Cream Truck Bandits. [grunts] Hey, the school is closed, buddy! Ho-ho! I don't think so. You are not getting away with that Christmas money, Curly. [ice cream truck music plays] Piece of junk! [screams] [music dies down] Hi. Yeah, I think I might have found those stolen coins. [buzzing sound approaching] [Barbi screams] Sorry. [Heather] I don't know where else to go. Mom! Dad! -Izzy! -Izzy! -[Heather and Pete] Izzy! -Mom! Dad! Thank you. [mouthing] [radio chatter] I could have been a police officer. -There you are! -He is the one who did it! It was all his fault! -He made me do it! -You left me behind! Shut up! -Don't put him in my car. -You left me. Don't put him in my car! [Rico] I loved her! -Don't put him in here! Shut up! -I loved you! [Rico] Now I hate you 'cause you're an ugly liar! [Barbi] How can you say that? Hey. Hey, Mike, can I have a minute with Ned here? I suppose. I told the police everything, how you saved me and how you helped Izzy. Well, thanks, but I deserve everything I get, so... [Ray] Yes, you do. But don't worry, the district attorney is the bass player in my band. He'll clear things up pretty quick if he thinks he's doing the right thing. -Yeah. -Listen to me. I meant what I said in there. You have a friend on the outside. Me. How'd you like a job as my assistant? Yeah, I can use the help. I would love that, Ray. All right, Ned. [Barbi] No! I should be in Acapulco! So you tricked one of them into thinking you were a ghost and he fainted? -Yep. -And you lured the other one into a janitor's closet and locked her inside? -Yep. -I can't believe you did all that. I keep telling you guys, I'm nine years old. I'm not a little kid anymore. Do you realize that this is the first time we've all been out together as a family in I don't even know how long? You know what, I-- I say we go have dinner right now, unless you just want to eat more pudding. [sighs] Things are gonna change, okay? We promise. Starting this Christmas. In fact, let's call the office in the morning and tell them Christmas vacation has already started. [Heather] That's perfect. A fresh start. Hey, Mom? Dad? While we're on the topic of fresh starts, maybe there's something else we can do. Ah. Hey, Ray. If you don't have plans for Christmas, we'd love to have you celebrate with us. Thank you. -Yeah, yeah, sure. -[Pete] Oh, great. [Ray] Yeah, yeah. [laughing and playing] [Pete] Oh my gosh. Ah, what a great Christmas. Yeah. Hey, and what's Christmas without goofy slippers. Yeah, I'll second that. We're not quite finished yet, Mom. -Here you go, Izz. -Nick, thanks! -[Pete] Wow. -Oh! -[Pete] Nice. -[Nick] Okay. I know we didn't buy a guitar on the one-day half-off sale, but... I figured that'll come in handy when you do get it. And I think that we've got one more present for Izzy. Yes. Just wait one second here. Is this... [Pete] I know, the empty case isn't much now, but that guitar is gonna look great in it. I'm so sorry we didn't make it to the guitar sale, but Dad and I, we are gonna get you a new guitar after Christmas. Don't anyone move, okay? This is for you, Izzy. [Izzy] Gloria! It's time I took her out of that case and gave her a new home. I think she'll really like it here. Wow. Yesterday, I didn't even have a guitar. Now I have enough gear to go on tour. Slow down, okay, rock star? You know, maybe you should finish elementary school first. Well, there's only one thing left to do. What's that? [all] Play something! [rock music] [man] ...Baker. Take four. Mark. [Izzy] Ooh! [director] Cut! Cut! [Rico] What are we gonna do about Ray? -[Barbi] Who? -[Rico] The janitor. What are we gonna do about Ray? Who? The janitor. Who? The actor from Lethal Weapon. [director] Cut! Let's reset. [laughing] [man] Resetting, resetting... That's right, Jason. A massive storm is rolling in later tonight, kind of like these biceps. Isabelle! Tim Allen, this is for you. [grunting like a caveman] [man] That's good. Yeah. [screaming] -Oh, honey! Honey! -[Heather] Help me! [Heather] Isn't this funny, this job we have? It's silly. [director] All right. Action! [man] Throw. [man] Reset. Oh, boy. -[grunting] -Ugh, so close. So close. [director] Action. [man] Oh, sorry! -What is wrong with her? -Oh, my gosh. You know what? This-- this is from you. Yeah. Anything-- Sorry. [man] 121, Baker. Take two. Mark! [Barbi] What's the matter, Rico? This is ridiculous! [Rico laughing] All right. [Barbi] It's okay. [man whispers] What is this? [Barbi] Are you scared? -No. -Oh. No. It's just... [man] Apple, 15 Apple. Take five. Mark. -[man] Rolling. -Whoa! I just do whatever you tell me to do. You wear the pants in this family. Yes, I do. Are you kidding me? We've been going... Are you kidding me? We've been going... I can't believe this. [Ned] You have to believe. [director] That's a cut. [Ned] I'm your own worst enemy. [all laughing] Come on, come on, baby. [director] Cut! [Izzy] You know she's not gonna follow. [indistinct chatter] -[man] Wow! -Ow! We're gonna do what we came here to do in the first place. [man] Can we hold for just a second? No, let's cut with all that noise. [man] 121 Charlie, take two. Mark. [Nick] Whoa! This is for you, Owen Wilson. Wow! [all laughing] You do that and I'm not taking-- [mumbling] I can hear her tummy growling. -Let's go. -That's not her tummy. [director] Cut! [Nick] Whoa! Sorry. You know, I was Charlize Theron's bodyguard. I guess my chances of becoming a police officer are over. You kind of remind me of my father. He was a cop. -[Heather] Look out! -Oh! [laughing] Was that too much? [Nick] Whoa! Sorry. ♪♪
