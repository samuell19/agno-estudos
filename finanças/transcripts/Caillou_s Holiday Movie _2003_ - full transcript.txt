...ON A CRISP, COLD DECEMBER MORNING, FOUR-YEAR-OLD CAILLOU WAS ASLEEP SNUG AS A BUG, WITH GILBERT HIS CAT. CAILLOU'S DADDY WAS ALREADY OUTSIDE SHOVELING SNOW WHILE CAILLOU'S LITTLE SISTER ROSIE AND HIS MOMMY WERE IN THE KITCHEN PREPARING BREAKFAST... ...TIME TO GET UP CAILLOU! - YAWN! HERE YOU GO REXY, YOU CAN STAY NICE AND WARM. GILBERT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WOW! DAAAADY! LOOK AT ALL THE SNOW! COME ON, GILBERT! CAILLOU WAS EXCITED TO SEE SO MUCH SNOW. HE COULDN'T WAIT TO GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY. GILBERT? (GIGGLES) SILLY CAT! GET OUT OF THERE! (GIGGLES) DADDY, I'M ALMOST READY TO GO OUTSIDE AND SHOVEL WITH YOU. - BUT YOU HAVEN'T HAD YOUR BREAKFAST YET, CAILLOU. WE'LL GO OUT TOGETHER LATER, OK? CAILLOU WAS UPSET BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GO OUTSIDE RIGHT AWAY. - OK, DADDY. - CAILLOU! - ROSIE, EAT YOUR CEREAL SWEETHEART. GOOD MORNING, CAILLOU. - HUH! 'MORNING. - HMM? DID SOMEONE WAKE UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED THIS MORNING? - CAILLOU WANTED TO COME OUTSIDE AND HELP ME SHOVEL, BUT I TOLD HIM HE HAD TO EAT BREAKFAST FIRST. (PURRRR!) - WELL, SOMEONE'S HUNGRY, WHY DON'T YOU FEED GILBERT? - OK, GILBERT. I'LL GET YOUR FOOD. - (GIGGLES) GILBERT HUNGRY! - GILBERT NO! GET DOWN. - COME ON ROSIE, AH! LET'S GET YOU DRESSED. - HERE YOU GO PARTNER. YOU'LL NEED YOUR ENERGY TO HELP ME SHOVEL ALL THAT SNOW! - CAILLOU WAS HUNGRY AFTER ALL AND HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HELPING DADDY OUTSIDE. - BRRRMMMM! LOOK ROSIE, I'M A SNOWPLOW! HEY! I'M GONNA GET YOU! - (GIGGLES) - CLEMENTINE! - HI CAILLOU! CAILLOU WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIS FRIEND CLEMENTINE. HE HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS COMING OVER AND CAILLOU LOVED SURPRISES! - HI ROSIE! - HI! - OH HOW LOVELY! COME ON IN. - WHEEEEEE! - TAG! YOU'RE IT! - I'M GONNA GET YOU CLEMENTINE! = HA HA HA HA! - HI CAILLOU, HI CLEMENTINE. HERE, IT'S AN INVITATION TO MY SCHOOL'S CHRISTMAS PLAY. - WOW! A CHRISTMAS PLAY. YES! - I'LL BE THERE TOO. MY BROTHER BILLY IS IN THE PLAY. - THAT MEANS SANTA IS COMING SOON! CAILLOU KNEW THAT CHRISTMAS WAS COMING SOON, BUT HE DIDN'T QUITE KNOW EXACTLY WHEN. - IS SANTA COMING TONIGHT, SARAH? - NOT THAT SOON CAILLOU, IN TWO WEEKS. - TWO WEEKS? WHAT WILL I DO UNTIL THEN? ♪ ♪ ♪♪ I'M JUST A KID WHO'S FOUR EACH DAY I GROW SOME MORE ♪ I LIKE EXPLORING, I'M CAILLOU ♪ THERE'S BIG NEWS TODAY CHRISTMAS IS NOT FAR AWAY ♪ SANTA I'D LIKE TO SAY, I'M CAILLOU ♪ THERE IS A TOY I'D JUST LOVE TO GET ♪ I'VE BEEN A GOOD BOY SO SANTA DON'T FORGET ♪ ANGELS AND CANDY CANE, FROST ON MY WINDOW PANE ♪ SANTA, PLEASE HEAR MY NAME, I'M CAILLOU ♪ CAILLOU , CAILLOU ♪ I'M CAILLOU HA HA! ♪ BRING IN THE CHRISTMAS TREE WITH LIGHTS ALL TWINKLY ♪ FOR DADDY, MOMMY, ROSIE AND CAILLOU ♪ CHRISTMAS IS THE DAY TO SHARE WITH FRIENDS AND PLAY ♪ PLEASE SANTA COME THIS WAY, I'M CAILLOU ♪ REINDEER ARE PRANCING THROUGH THE AIR ♪ SANTA'S ELVES ARE DANCING THERE'S LAUGHTER EVERYWHERE HA HA! ♪ ANGELS AND CANDY CANE, FROST ON MY WINDOW PANE ♪ SANTA, PLEASE HEAR MY NAME , I'M CAILLOU ♪ CAILLOU , CAILLOU I'M CAILLOU HA HA HA HA!

I'M A SNOW PLOW. WHAT ARE YOU DOING MOMMY? - I'M WRITING CHRISTMAS CARDS TO OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO WISH THEM A MERRY CHRISTMAS. - SARAH SAYS THAT CHRISTMAS IS IN TWO WEEKS, IS THAT A LONG TIME AWAY? - WE'LL LET'S SEE... CHRISTMAS IS EXACTLY 12 DAYS AWAY. WHICH DOESN'T LEAVE US MUCH TIME TO GET EVERYTHING DONE! - LIKE WHAT? - WELL, FIRST, SEND OFF THESE CARDS, THEN WE HAVE TO GET A TREE, DECORATE THE HOUSE AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE SANTA CLAUS PARADE. - SANTA'S IN A PARADE!? WHEN? - HMM... IN A FEW DAYS, I GUESS. CAILLOU WAS VERY EXCITED AT THE THOUGHT OF SEEING SANTA. BUT HE WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW MANY DAYS WERE LEFT UNTIL CHRISTMAS! - CAN I DRAW SOMETHING ON YOUR CARDS MOMMY? - HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR OWN CHRISTMAS CARDS? - YES! - OOOH! GILBERT? A-HEE-HEE! SILLY CAT. - I'M GONNA MAKE A CARD FOR MOMMY AND DADDY AND ROSIE AND GILBERT. OH! AND SARAH AND LEO AND CLEMENTINE. - HI CAILLOU. - STOP IT ROSIE. YOU'RE STEPPING ON MY CHRISTMAS CARDS. ROSIE STOP! - WHAT'S WRONG CAILLOU? - ROSIE IS STEPPING ON ALL THE CARDS THAT I'M GIVING MY FRIENDS! - ROSIE GIVE TOO! - COME ON ROSIE, LET CAILLOU WORK AND WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU TO GIVE, OK? - OH! I ALMOST FORGOT! GRANDMA AND GRANDPA. CAILLOU WORKED ALL AFTERNOON ON HIS CHRISTMAS CARDS... - HERE YOU GO ROSIE. DO YOU WANT MOMMY TO HELP YOU MAKE A PRESENT FOR CAILLOU? WE COULD DRAW A PICTURE TOGETHER. BUT ROSIE DIDN'T WANT MOMMY TO HELP HER. SHE WANTED TO BE LIKE HER BIG BROTHER AND DO SOMETHING ALL BY HERSELF. - DADDY! LOOK AT ALL THE CHRISTMAS CARDS I MADE. CAN WE GIVE THEM TOMORROW? - WE USUALLY MAIL CHRISTMAS CARDS, CAILLOU. - BUT THEY NEED THEM BEFORE CHRISTMAS. - DON'T WORRY, EVERYONE WILL GET THEIR CARDS ON TIME. HERE, THIS CHRISTMAS CALENDAR WILL HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY DAYS ARE LEFT UNTIL SANTA COMES. SEE THESE WINDOWS? THERE ARE 12 OF THEM, ONE FOR EACH DAY LEFT UNTIL CHRISTMAS. - I CAN COUNT TO 12! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. - GOOD FOR YOU! NOW, EVERY NIGHT STARTING TONIGHT WE'LL OPEN ONE WINDOW AND DISCOVER A STORY BEHIND IT. - I LIKE STORIES. - YOU'LL LIKE THESE STORIES A LOT. EACH WINDOW SHOWS US HOW CHRISTMAS IS CELEBRATED DIFFERENTLY ALL OVER THE WORLD. - WITH A TREE AND PRESENTS AND SANTA? - WELL THAT DEPENDS, SOME CHILDREN CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. - CAN I OPEN A WINDOW? - SURE. THIS ONE. - IT'S STUCK. CAILLOU DIDN'T WANT TO TEAR THE CALENDAR SO HE OPENED IT VERY CAREFULLY. HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WAS BEHIND THE LITTLE DOOR. - A CHRISTMAS TREE! - THIS IS HOW CHRISTMAS WAS CELEBRATED A LONG TIME AGO IN A COUNTRY CALLED GERMANY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT IT? - YES! - IN A COUNTRY FAR, FAR AWAY, THERE LIVED A YOUNG BOY, ABOUT YOUR AGE, WHO LOVED GOING TO WORK WITH HIS FATHER. HIS NAME WAS FRITZ AND HIS FATHER WAS A LUMBERJACK WHO CUT DOWN TREES FOR A LIVING. FRITZ LIKED TO WATCH THE MEN DO THEIR WORK AND HE KNEW THAT SOME DAY HE WOULD GROW UP TO BE A LUMBERJACK JUST LIKE HIS FATHER. FRITZ AND HIS DAD HEADED INTO THE VILLAGE TO SELL THEIR TREES. (NEIGH!) FRITZ NOTICED THAT THE MEN DIDN'T USE THE TINY LITTLE TREE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLED. BUT FRITZ SUDDENLY HAD AN IDEA HOW THAT LITTLE TREE COULD BE USED. HE THOUGHT THE TREE WOULD LOOK NICE IN HIS HOUSE, AT CHRISTMAS TIME. AND FRITZ LOVED THE SMELL OF TREES BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. FRITZ'S MOTHER THOUGHT THE TREE COULD USE A LITTLE DECORATION AND SINCE THAT TIME, PEOPLE IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE BROUGHT AN EVERGREEN TREE INTO THEIR HOMES AT CHRISTMAS TIME. - I LIKE THE CHRISTMAS CALENDAR DADDY. - TOMORROW NIGHT WE'LL OPEN ANOTHER WINDOW. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO TO SLEEP. GOOD NIGHT, CAILLOU. (KISS). - GOOD NIGHT, DADDY. AND CAILLOU FELL ASLEEP DREAMING ABOUT GERMANY AND FRITZ AND CHRISTMAS TREES. CAILLOU WOKE UP IN A BIG HURRY THE NEXT MORNING. - ERGH! CAN WE GET A CHRISTMAS TREE TODAY? - UH, GOOD MORNING, CAILLOU. - UM, GOOD MORNING. SO, CAN WE GET A TREE? - I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. - ME TOO. I'LL CALL A FRIEND OF MINE AND SEE IF WE CAN COME BY. - WHAT FRIEND, DADDY? GO WHERE? WHEN? - HAHA! YOU'LL SEE. IT'S A SURPRISE. CAILLOU LOVED SURPRISES, BUT HE REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHO DADDY WAS CALLING AND WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO GET THEIR CHRISTMAS TREE. - WHO IS DADDY CALLING? - CAN'T TELL, IT'S A SURPRISE. - ALL SET. LET'S FINISH BREAKFAST, GET DRESSED AND GET GOING! - YAYYY! - ROSIE IS SURE SLEEPING IN LATE THIS MORNING. (MEOW) - GILBERT? GILBERT HIDING? ♪ GILBERT WHERE ARE YOU? HA HA HA! SILLY CAT. CAILLOU AND HIS FAMILY LEFT TO GO AND GET A CHRISTMAS TREE. BUT CAILLOU STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE GOING. BUT CAILLOU STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE GOING. - WHERE ARE WE GOING, DADDY? - YEAH, WHERE, DADDY? - YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON. BUT ALL CAILLOU COULD SEE WERE TREES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD. - I KNOW! WE'RE GOING TO GERMANY RIGHT, DADDY? = HA HA HA! - NO CAILLOU! - ROSIE LOOK! IT'S JONAH'S FARM! - JONAH! HORSIE! BUT CAILLOU WAS SUDDENLY DISAPPOINTED. HE LIKED JONAH, BUT HE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO GET A CHRISTMAS TREE TODAY. - BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TREE DADDY? - THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. JONAH HAS A CHRISTMAS TREE FARM! - OHHHH! - WELCOME BACK, CAILLOUUUUU! - WHEEEEE! - ME TOO! WHEEE! - THE PLACE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL IN THE WINTERTIME, JONAH. - THANKS, IT'S OUR BUSIEST TIME OF YEAR, WHAT WITH THE CHRISTMAS TREE FARM AND ALL. - WHAT'S A TREE FARM, JONAH? - YOU KNOW THAT AT CHRISTMAS TIME A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE A TREE TO PUT IN THEIR HOUSE TO DECORATE. SO I GROW TREES JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE. - KIND OF LIKE A TREE GARDEN? - EXACTLY. (NEIGH!) I THINK SOMEONE OVER THERE WOULD LOVE TO TAKE YOU ALL FOR A SLEIGH RIDE TO THE TREE FARM. - GINGER! BLACKIE! - HERE YOU GO CAILLOU, DO YOU REMEMBER HOW TO FEED THEM? GENTLE... GOOD BOY BLACKIE. I THINK HE REMEMBERS YOU, CAILLOU. - CAN WE GO TO THE TREE FARM NOW JONAH? - ABSOLUTELY, BUT FIRST, WE NEED A BLANKET TO KEEP US WARM ON THE SLEIGH RIDE. COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND GET THE BIG RED BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE BARN, CAILLOU? - YES! (NEIGH!!!) CAILLOU WAS STARTLED BY THE NOISE. - HELLO HORSIE, YOU'RE MY SIZE. I HAVE TO GO NOW, WE'RE GOING ON A SLEIGH RIDE. BYE HORSIE. HERE, JONAH. THERE'S A LITTLE HORSE IN THE BARN. - YES THERE IS, THAT'S OUR NEW COLT. - COLT? - YES. THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A BABY HORSE. MAYBE YOU CAN COME BACK IN THE SPRING TO SEE HOW MUCH SHE'S GROWN. - OH BOY! SURE! - IS EVERYBODY READY? = YES! - YAA! - THEN HERE WE GO! YAHA! AND THEY ALL HEADED OFF TO FIND A CHRISTMAS TREE. - LOOK AT ALL THE CHRISTMAS TREES ROSIE! - WHOA! BLACKY! WHOA! GINGER! DID YOU ENJOY THE RIDE? = YEAH! - CHRISTMAS TREES EVERYWHERE! HEE HEE HEE! - CHOOSE ANY TREE YOU LIKE. - OK. COME ON, ROSIE. THERE WERE SO MANY TREES. CAILLOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE GOING TO PICK ONE. - ROSIE! ARE YOU HIDING? I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE HIDING. BEHIND THAT TREE! I SEE YOU! - YOU HIDE CAILLOU. - OK. CAILLOU AND ROSIE THOUGHT THE CHRISTMAS TREE FOREST WAS A GREAT PLACE TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK. - CAILLOU-UUU! CAILLOU? CAILLOU DIDN'T WANT ROSIE TO FIND HIM. SO HE STAYED VERY QUIET. BUT SUDDENLY CAILLOU FELT ALONE. AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE. CAILLOU DIDN'T LIKE BEING ALL BY HIMSELF. - ROSIE?... MOMMY?... DADDY? - THERE YOU ARE CAILLOU. DID YOU FIND A TREE YOU LIKE? - THESE TREES ARE BIG AND SCARY. - WELL WHY DON'T WE GO OVER TO ANOTHER ROW WHERE THERE ARE SMALLER TREES, MORE YOUR SIZE. ♪ ♪ ♪♪ THE CHRISTMAS TREES ARE IN A FIELD ♪ ONE WILL GROW THE TALLEST ♪ THE TREE THAT DOESN'T GET SUNLIGHT ♪ WILL END UP THE SMALLEST ♪ NOW THERE IS ONE SPECIAL TREE, SMALL AND BENT AND HARD TO SEE, ♪ AS TINY AS A TREE CAN BE THAT'S DIFFERENT YOU'LL AGREE ♪ BENT AND TINY CHRISTMAS TREE ♪ PRETTY AS A TREE CAN BE ♪ BENT AND TINY CHRISTMAS TREE THE PERFECT TREE FOR ME! - NOW, CAILLOU, SEE HOW EACH TREE IS DIFFERENT.

WHAT DO YOU THINK, ROSIE? - CHRISTMAS TREEEE! - WELL, THAT SETTLES IT. CAILLOU WAS PROUD TO HAVE PICKED THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND WANTED TO BE SURE IT WAS IN THE BEST SPOT IN THE LIVING ROOM. - CAN WE PUT THE TREE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM DADDY? - IT WOULD BE A BETTER IDEA IF WE PUT IT IN A CORNER, CAILLOU. - OK. OVER THERE! NO WAIT! THAT CORNER WOULD BE BETTER. NO UMM, MAYBE OVER THERE! - WHUP! - PERFECT! - WHOOOA! - GILBERT! CAILLOU WAS VERY HAPPY WITH HOW HIS TREE LOOKED, AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT NEEDED TO BECOME A REAL CHRISTMAS TREE. THAT EVENING, CAILLOU HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA. HE WANTED TO MAKE A SPECIAL STAR TO PUT ON TOP OF HIS VERY OWN SPECIAL TREE. MEANWHILE... ROSIE HAD A FEW IDEAS OF HER OWN. ROSIE MADE A PRESENT FOR GILBERT. ALL BY HERSELF! - THAT'S WONDERFUL ROSIE! OH, YOU'RE SUCH A BIG GIRL NOW. - (GIGGLES) (GIGGLES) DADDY FUNNY. - YES DADDY'S FUNNY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE WRAPPING PAPER? - ROSIE BIG GIRL NOW! - GILBERT CUT THAT OUT. SHOOO! GO AWAY. - OOOOFFF! GIIIIILBERT! - HA HA HA HA! - ARE YOU ALRIGHT? - HA! HA! DADDY'S VERY FUNNY. NOW COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME UP! - COULD WE HELP YOU DECORATE THE TREE DADDY? - I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA CAILLOU. - WHAT'S THAT ROSIE? - PWESENT. - THERE YOU GO, WHY DON'T YOU TWO HELP ME FINISH DECORATING THE TREE? - MINE! - MOMMY GAVE THIS ONE TO ME! CAILLOU SAW HOW UPSET ROSIE WAS, SO HE DECIDED TO LET HER HAVE THE ORNAMENT. SO HE DECIDED TO LET HER HAVE THE ORNAMENT. - HERE ROSIE, YOU CAN HAVE IT. - THAT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU, CAILLOU. CHRISTMAS IS A TIME OF GIVING AND OF SHARING AND YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF SHARING WITH ROSIE. - CAN I PUT MY STAR UP NOW? - THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, LET'S SEE THAT STAR OF YOURS CAILLOU. = HA HA HA HA! - WHAT'S SO FUNNY? - DADDY FUNNY! - AND NOW THE LIGHTS! - WAIT! I WANT THE ROOM DARK. READY?... = AAAH! - OOOH! - THE TREE DOESN'T LOOK LITTLE ANYMORE. - IT LOOKS GREAT! - IT'S THE BEST TREE WE'VE EVER HAD! CAILLOU AND HIS FAMILY ALL LOVED THEIR CHRISTMAS TREE. NOW IT FELT LIKE CHRISTMAS IN THEIR HOME. WHEN CAILLOU GOT TO BED, HE WAS VERY TIRED. - DID YOU HAVE FUN TODAY? - YES! AND NOW I CAN'T WAIT TILL SANTA PUTS ALL MY PRESENTS UNDER THE TREE. - CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT MORE THAN GETTING PRESENTS FROM SANTA. - REALLY? LIKE WHAT? - CHRISTMAS IS A TIME FOR GIVING, ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO AREN'T AS FORTUNATE AS WE ARE. - WHAT DOES "FORTUNATE" MEAN, MOMMY? - WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOME AND WE ALWAYS HAVE PLENTY TO EAT AND YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE ALL THESE TOYS. - BUT I DON'T PLAY WITH ALL OF THEM. - I HAVE AN IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU GATHER UP THE TOYS THAT YOU DON'T PLAY WITH AND TOMORROW WE'LL MAKE SURE THEY GO TO CHILDREN WHO WILL ENJOY THEM AS MUCH AS YOU ONCE DID. NOW IT'S TIME TO OPEN ANOTHER CHRISTMAS CALENDAR WINDOW. - YAYYY! - LET'S SEE, THERE'S ELEVEN WINDOWS, SO IF YOU OPEN ONE HOW MANY WINDOWS ARE LEFT? - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! - RIGHT! TOMORROW THERE WILL BE TEN MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS. LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE. - WHAT IS IT, MOMMY? - THIS IS HOW CHILDREN, IN A COUNTRY CALLED MEXICO, CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THEY DO? - YES, YES! - SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, MEXICAN CHILDREN HAVE A PARADE. THEY DRESS UP AS SHEPHERDS, AND AS ANGELS AND A YOUNG GIRL DRESSED AS MARY RIDES A DONKEY. A LITTLE BOY DRESSED AS JOSEPH LEADS THE WAY. FOLLOWING THEM ARE THREE CHILDREN DRESSED UP AS THE WISE KINGS. THEY DRESS UP TO TELL THE STORY OF CHRISTMAS. DID YOU KNOW THAT IN MEXICO THEY SPEAK SPANISH? - SPANISH? - IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS IN SPANISH? - YES! - FELIZ NAVIDAD. - FE-LIZ NAVI-DAD! CAILLOU LIKED LEARNING NEW WORDS AND HE LIKED HOW MERRY CHRISTMAS SOUNDED IN SPANISH. FELIZ NAVIDAD! - I WISH I COULD BE IN A PARADE TOO. - GOOD NIGHT, CAILLOU. SLEEP TIGHT. - AND DON'T LET THE BED BUGS BITE. WHEN CAILLOU WOKE UP, HE REMEMBERED THE IDEA OF GIVING AWAY SOME TOYS HE DIDN'T PLAY WITH ANYMORE. - C'MON, REXY. WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. SEE REXY? I DON'T PLAY WITH THESE TOYS ANYMORE THE WAY I PLAY WITH YOU. - WHAT CAILLOU DOING? - I'M GIVING THESE TOYS AWAY. - REXY? - HA HA HA! NO, SILLY! NOT REXY! THESE TOYS THAT I DON'T PLAY WITH ANYMORE. I'M GIVING THEM TO KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE AS MANY TOYS AS ME AND YOU. - NO DUCKIE. - NO ROSIE. THESE ARE FOR KIDS WHO AREN'T AS FORTU-NOUS AS US. - BUT ROSIE LIKE DUCKIE. - OK, YOU CAN KEEP DUCKIE. LOOK MOMMY. THESE ARE THE TOYS I PICKED TO GIVE AWAY. - GOOD FOR YOU, CAILLOU. THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE LOVELY PRESENTS. HOW ABOUT SOME BREAKFAST. YOU MUST BE HUNGRY AFTER ALL THAT HARD WORK. ROSIE DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND ABOUT GIVING AND SHARING. BUT SHE WANTED TO MAKE CAILLOU HAPPY, SO SHE DECIDED TO WRAP UP REXY AND GIVE HIM TO CAILLOU AS A SURPRISE CHRISTMAS PRESENT. - SEE ROSIE? I'M PACKING ALL THE THINGS I'M GIVING AWAY. OH! I FORGOT SOMETHING! - (GIGGLES) ROSIE WANTED TO GIVE AWAY SOME THINGS TOO. - GIVE AWAY! GIVE AWAY! BUT SHE DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT TO GIVE AWAY. MOMMY AND CAILLOU WERE GOING TO THE PLACE WHERE CAILLOU'S TOYS WOULD BE GIVEN AWAY. BUT CAILLOU DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS. - WHERE ARE WE GOING, MOMMY? - HERE'S A CLUE. WHAT'S BIG AND RED AND... - SANTA CLAUS! - YES, BUT WHAT'S BIG AND RED AND HAS A LOUD SIREN. - I KNOW! A FIRE TRUCK! - EXACTLY. AND WHERE DO WE FIND FIRE TRUCKS? - IN A FIRE STATION! - YOU GOT IT! AT CHRISTMAS TIME SOME FIREMEN COLLECT TOYS AND GIVE THEM AWAY TO CHILDREN AS PRESENTS. - LIKE SANTA! CAILLOU REALLY LIKED THE GREAT BIG FIRE TRUCKS. THE FIREMEN HAD USED THEM TO RESCUE GILBERT FROM A TREE. - HERE, LET ME HELP YOU. - THANK YOU. - HI CAILLOU. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. - HI. - ARE THESE TOYS THAT YOU'RE GIVING AWAY? - UH HUH. - WELL, THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU, CAILLOU. - SPARKY! SPARKY WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE CAILLOU AGAIN TOO! - HA! HA! - I TAUGHT SPARKY A NEW TRICK, CAILLOU. WANNA SEE? GIVE THE PAW SPARKY. GOOD BOY! - DO YOU WANNA TRY? - OK. SPARKY GIVE THE PAW. GOOD BOY, SPARKY! - LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S IN THIS BIG BOX OF YOURS. STACIE, WE HAVE SOME MORE ITEMS. - HI CAILLOU! - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I'M FIXING UP SOME TOYS TO MAKE THEM GOOD AS NEW AGAIN. - WOW! - NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT. - HUH? HOW DID THAT GET IN THERE? - HA HA HA! THIS IS A STRANGE TOY. AND THERE'S MORE... - I KNOW! ROSIE PUT THEM THERE. - HA! ROSIE PROBABLY SAW YOU GIVING THINGS AWAY AND WANTED TO ADD A FEW THINGS OF HER OWN. - NOW THIS IS BETTER. - LET ME SEE. HMM, I HAVE JUST THE THING TO FIX IT. DO YOU WANNA HELP ME, CAILLOU? - WOW! LOOK AT ALL THE WHEELS! - LET'S SEE... I THINK THIS ONE WILL BE A PERFECT FIT. CAN YOU HOLD THE TRUCK FOR ME? THERE! IS IT ALRIGHT? - IT'S JUST LIKE NEW. - GREAT! WHY DON'T YOU BRING IT OVER SO I CAN WRAP IT. - IS SOMETHING WRONG? NOW THAT CAILLOU'S TRUCK WAS WORKING AGAIN, HE WASN'T SURE HE STILL WANTED TO GIVE IT AWAY. - CAILLOU, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE BOY VERY HAPPY WHEN HE GETS TO PLAY WITH YOUR TRUCK. CAILLOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND DECIDED THAT IT WOULD MAKE HIM HAPPY TO GIVE HIS TRUCK TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR CHRISTMAS. - HERE. CAN I HELP YOU WRAP IT? - YOU SURE CAN. - THIS TRUCK IS GOING TO MAKE SOMEONE VERY HAPPY THIS CHRISTMAS. AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU, CAILLOU. THAT NIGHT, CAILLOU WAS IN A BIG HURRY TO GET TO BED. - REXY, REXY! DADDY'S GOING TO TELL US ANOTHER CHRISTMAS STORY. REXY? OH IT'S YOU, TEDDY. I WAS LOOKING FOR REXY. - READY FOR ANOTHER CALENDAR STORY? - YES! - LET'S SEE HOW MANY WINDOWS ARE LEFT. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! - RIGHT! SO, WE OPEN ONE TONIGHT AND TOMORROW THERE WILL BE NINE DAYS LEFT 'TIL CHRISTMAS. - IT LOOKS LIKE A CLASSROOM. - YOU'RE RIGHT! THIS TAKES PLACE A LONG TIME AGO IN A COUNTRY CALLED ENGLAND. THE CHILDREN ARE AT SCHOOL AND THEY'RE WRITING LETTERS TO THEIR FAMILIES. THE PARENTS THOUGHT THE LETTERS WERE SO BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED, THEY DECIDED TO SEND HOLIDAY GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES TOO. SOON, PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD WERE SENDING BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED HOLIDAY CARDS TO EACH OTHER. - THAT'S WHEN CHRISTMAS CARDS STARTED. - THAT'S RIGHT. AND NOW, BEDTIME. SWEET DREAMS, CAILLOU. (KISS) - GOOD NIGHT, DADDY. WHEN CAILLOU WOKE UP, HE REMEMBERED HIS CHRISTMAS CARDS AND WANTED TO MAIL THEM RIGHT AWAY. - HI MOMMY. HI ROSIE. CAN WE MAIL MY CHRISTMAS CARDS TODAY? - HI CAILLOU. - SURE, CAN I SEE THEM? - CLEMENTINE AND SARAH AND JASON AND JEFFREY. - HMM... I THINK YOU FORGOT SOMEONE! - WHO? - HOW ABOUT A LETTER FOR SANTA? - SANTA! - YAY! SANTA! CAILLOU DECIDED TO DRAW A PICTURE OF ALL THE TOYS HE WANTED SANTA TO BRING HIM THIS YEAR. - ROSIE TOO. OOOH! - WHAT'S THAT, ROSIE? - HORSIE. - WHAT'S THAT? - A SPACE STATION. - IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT SANTA TO BRING YOU? - YES!

NICHOLAS FELT SORRY FOR A FARMER AND HIS FAMILY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR FOOD. HE WAS A VERY THOUGHTFUL AND GENEROUS MAN, SO HE DECIDED TO GIVE THE YOUNG FAMILY A BASKET OF FOOD. THE FAMILY NEVER KNEW WHO HAD GIVEN THEM THE WONDERFUL PRESENT. AND FROM THAT DAY ON, NICHOLAS DECIDED TO LEAVE A PRESENT FOR THE FAMILY EVERY YEAR. SAINT NICK TAUGHT US THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING KIND AND THOUGHTFUL TO OTHERS. - I KNOW HOW TO BE KIND AND THOUGHTFUL, DADDY. - YOU SURE DO. YOU WERE VERY THOUGHTFUL WHEN YOU GAVE YOUR TOYS AWAY.

BOYS AND GIRLS ALL OVER THE WORLD USED TO LEAVE SOMETHING FOR SANTA IN THEIR SHOES. IN FRANCE, CHILDREN PLACE THEIR SHOES BY THE FIREPLACE. AND IN HOLLAND, WHERE SANTA CLAUS IS CALLED "SINTERKLASS", CHILDREN LEAVE HAY AND A CARROT IN THEIR SHOES FOR SINTERKLASS' HORSE TO EAT. IN HUNGARY, CHILDREN SHINE THEIR SHOES BEFORE PUTTING THEM NEAR A WINDOW SILL. IN ITALY, THERE IS A WOMAN CALLED 'LA BEFANA' WHO ARRIVES AT CHRISTMAS TIME, LIKE SANTA CLAUS. AND CHILDREN LEAVE FOOD FOR HER IN THEIR SHOES OUTSIDE THEIR FRONT DOOR. AND IN PUERTO RICO, CHILDREN PUT VEGETABLES UNDER THEIR BEDS FOR THE CAMELS OF THE THREE KINGS. - I'M GOING TO LEAVE SOMETHING FOR SANTA TOO DADDY, BUT I WON'T PUT IT IN MY SHOES, OK? - OK, CAILLOU. SWEET DREAMS. AND CAILLOU HAD VERY SWEET DREAMS. - SARAH'S CHRISTMAS PLAY IS TODAY. CAN WE GO, MOMMY? PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEEEEASE! - I DON'T SEE WHY NOT. - WHAT TIME DOES IT START? - GRANDMA SAID AT 3 O'CLOCK. - FINE, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO FIRST. - WHAT? - THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS OUTSIDE. SO YOU'D BETTER GET DRESSED AND COME AND HELP ME. GRANDPA'S COMING OVER TO HELP, TOO. CAILLOU COULDN'T WAIT TO HELP DADDY AND GRANDPA WITH THE LIGHTS. HE FELT LIKE A VERY BIG BOY. - HELLO. HERE'S YOUR EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS. - RIGHT ON TIME! - GRANDPA! - ARE YOU READY TO SET UP SOME LIGHTS CAILLOU? - WE NEED LOTS AND LOTS OF LIGHTS. MEANWHILE, ROSIE WAS BUSY, TOO. SHE WAS MAKING SURE HER PRESENTS WERE READY FOR CHRISTMAS. - CAILLOU... DADDY.. MOMMY... GILBERT... NO, GILBERT! PWESENTS SUPWISE! - THERE! - GOOD JOB CAILLOU. IT LOOKS GREAT. THAT ABOUT DOES IT. CAILLOU WAS VERY PROUD OF HAVING DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB. HE COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LIGHTS ALL LIT UP. - GOOD JOB YOU TWO! CAILLOU WE HAVE TO GET GOING. SARAH'S PLAY STARTS SOON AND WE DON'T WANNA BE LATE. BUT WHEN CAILLOU AND HIS FAMILY ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL, THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE. - I THINK WE'RE EARLY. - IT'S EXACTLY 3:00. - NOT ACCORDING TO THE SCHOOL CLOCK, IT SAYS 2:00. - MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK SANTA FOR A NEW WATCH. - ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. LET'S BEGIN THE REHEARSAL. ♪ ♪ - HI SARAH! - HI CAILLOU! I'M SAD BECAUSE CHRISTMAS IS COMING AND... WHERE'S JIMMY? - JIMMY? THAT'S YOUR CUE TO COME ON STAGE. - HE'S SICK, MISS JOHNSON. - OH DEAR.

HE'S ON HIS WAY! - 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE NOT A CREATURE WAS STIRRING, NOT EVEN A MOUSE. THE STOCKINGS WERE HUNG BY THE CHIMNEY WITH CARE, IN HOPES THAT ST. NICHOLAS SOON WOULD BE THERE. THE CHILDREN WERE NESTLED ALL SNUG IN THEIR BEDS, WHILE VISIONS OF SUGAR-PLUMS DANCED IN THEIR HEADS. AND MAMMA IN HER 'KERCHIEF, AND I IN MY CAP, HAD JUST SETTLED DOWN FOR A LONG WINTER'S NAP. WHEN OUT ON THE LAWN THERE AROSE SUCH A CLATTER, I SPRANG FROM THE BED TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER. AWAY TO THE WINDOW I FLEW LIKE A FLASH, TORE OPEN THE SHUTTERS AND THREW UP THE SASH. WHEN, WHAT TO MY WONDERING EYES SHOULD APPEAR, BUT A MINIATURE SLEIGH, AND EIGHT TINY REINDEER, WITH A LITTLE OLD DRIVER, SO LIVELY AND QUICK, I KNEW IN A MOMENT IT MUST BE ST. NICK. - NOW, DASHER! NOW, DANCER! NOW, PRANCER AND VIXEN! ON, COMET! ON CUPID! ON, DONNER AND BLITZEN! - AND THEN, IN A TWINKLING, I HEARD ON THE ROOF THE PRANCING AND PAWING OF EACH LITTLE HOOF. AS I DREW IN MY HAND, AND WAS TURNING AROUND, DOWN THE CHIMNEY ST. NICHOLAS CAME WITH A BOUND. HIS EYES, HOW THEY TWINKLED! HIS DIMPLES HOW MERRY! HIS CHEEKS WERE LIKE ROSES, HIS NOSE LIKE A CHERRY! HE SPOKE NOT A WORD, BUT WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS WORK, AND FILLED ALL THE STOCKINGS, THEN TURNED WITH A JERK, AND LAYING HIS FINGER ASIDE OF HIS NOSE, AND GIVING A NOD, UP THE CHIMNEY HE ROSE. HE SPRANG TO HIS SLEIGH, TO HIS TEAM GAVE A WHISTLE, AND AWAY THEY ALL FLEW LIKE THE DOWN OF A THISTLE. BUT I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM, ER HE DROVE OUT OF SIGHT. - HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT! - SWEET DREAMS, CAILLOU. CAILLOU WAS EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE PRESENTS. AND HE NOTICED THAT SANTA HAD EATEN ALL HIS COOKIES. - PWESENTS! - MOMMY, MOMMY! SANTA ATE ALL MY COOKIES! - I SEE! - CAN I GIVE MY PRESENTS FIRST? PLEASE! PLEASE! - ALRIGHT, YOUR PRESENTS FIRST. - HERE, MOMMY. HERE DADDY. - THANK YOU, SWEETHEART! WHEN DID YOU MAKE THESE? - IT WAS A SURPRISE!
