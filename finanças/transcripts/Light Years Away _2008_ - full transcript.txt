David come here. I want to show you something. What is it Grandpa? What does this look like? It looks like a rock. That is not just a rock. That is a visitor from another world. It's a meteorite. That's exactly what it is -- a meteorite! Came From Another World -- across the vast reaches of outer space. A world we couldn't even begin to imagine. Can I touch it Granpa? Of course. As a matter of fact you can keep it. Wow. a lot of questions in that hand of yours, David. Maybe someday you just might be the one find all the answers. I'd love to do that. You know what they call someone who does that? that person is called an astronomer. my meteorite. The Next Generation a telescope six times the power of the Hubble will take its place in the cosmos. It'll be the first satellites Journey outside Earth's orbit angle outwards into space. It'll be able to detect black holes sense, dark matter and much much more. An impressive array of Technology assembled in one satellite. Every form of remote sensing its award x-ray detection, radio Scopes and the most Flawless Mirror ever designed by men. The launching of the observator one will truly be the most advanced team Space Telescope in history, and that gentleman ladies, is the amazing Observator one satellite. I'm sorry as impressive as it is. We are not interested in funding the launching of your satellite at this time. But don't you see this is the first satellite of its kind that can see through a black hole. But it can also be pulled into a supermassive black hole and suck all our funding with it. I have spent seven years of my life building this satellite. The only thing left required is the funding to launch it into space. It will be a success. I want to thank you all for your time. Thank you very much. I want to thank you all for your time. Thank you very much. Doctor Melvin, I believe the board members made their feelings very clear. I don't know why you're wasting your time with that ground scope. You've shown your enthusiasm for the satellite doctor, but the board of directors have a sizable investment in the ground scope. I will lend them or investment meetings for next week. My satellite will go up in the meantime. Dr. Summers has been reassigned to the ground scope and that's the end of it. Fine. DOG BARKING FIRE ALARM GOING OFF Something else, isn't it? Dr. Hudson it certainly is. And I can't wait to study Upsilon Andromedae from this scope. The magnification is significantly stronger than anything I've had access to before. I'm anxious for you to do your studies here David. Our telescope program has been lagging far too long. Dr. Melvin had access his heart's not in it. He's not one of us. He's too wrapped up in getting his satellite off the ground. I can remember the nights when I could stand here hours on end staring at a speck of light and taking observations. That's why I hired you David to put some of that old fire back into this end of the telescope program. Wake up, David, paging David Sommers, the aliens have landed. So funny. You falling asleep again? I didn't just resting my eyes. Maybe you can rest your eyes in a new line of work. I've never heard of an astronomer who can't stay awake at night. I think this move is just wipe me out. You've been here three months that excuse won't work with dr. Hudson. I just wasn't expecting to have to take charge of the ground scope yet. How'd you know my nickname? I don't? We have atomic particles subatomic particles all circulating together. That's it. They would have stopped circulating the matter containing these electrons whether it be in this book or say Jennifer here. All would crumble, the matter would cease to exist, they would disappear -- and this is not science fiction people. This is pure scientific fact. All right now just recently discovered are Electro spheres and I want you to write this down. Electra-spheres are thought to be the missing link. Our electrospheres as a member of the atom family. You mean like Morticia or Uncle Fester? It wasn't that funny. Yes, electrospheres our relative particles to the atom group, but their nuclei are quite different. Take this beaker of water. The water has to evaporate and disappear. But where does it go? Okay, it moves from point A to B the air to evaporation. Okay. Electrosphere act similar to evaporation but with solid matter thus we have a transmission from one point to another point a Quantum Leap if you will. You know the fundamentals of this and remember it's only a theory....... That the class bell propels things into motion. Jennifer, You need help with your homework? It's Observator, I mean what astronomer doesn't want to work there, but I'd never gotten transferred here if it weren't for you. So things are really looking up. That's what they're paying you for, why? To look up at that night here. You're a funny guy. Tell you this Omni . He's got a mind of his own these days. He's probably going to replace me. Probably. Pick a card. You know Hudson was concerned that the ground telescope was going to rust away from neglect. So it's perfect that you're here. Have you known Hudson long. He likes to audit my classes every now.. He's been to six this quarter alone. Give me the card. That's a different trick. Pay attention. That's my card. . Hey, not bad Stargazer. How'd you do that? I've taken the magician's oath. Yeah, how many years have I known? You still won't tell me how you do this. Well Einstein I will say this, there's physics and then there's magic. That's all I'll say. Man, the singles life. You working on divorce three and four. You seeing anyone? We got modern technology on our side. Old Omni here can produce Miracles -- sic em boy! You can't -- you can't really be serious. They work in the Cloning department I think they're really being studied there. Hey, baby what are your names? I'm bringing you an unbelievable once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally go out with some real macho dudes. We know nothing about you. Don't worry. My master just got me fixed. And trust me. I'm not just another pretty face. May I have your telephone coordinates, please? Our phone numbers? this can't work. Thank you, please check your coordinates. Our what? what are you doing tomorrow night, baby? ........that should do it. Next time give me a printout of your calculations. Will you sweetie. Your penmanship is impossible David. Okay. This should be the exact position. Sending you the coordinates. bingo! Voila. Upsilon Andromeda. That's not Upsilon Andromeda? How strange. I inserted in the coordinates you gave me You've got the wrong sequence. No, it's the right sequence. You know, I used to look at Andromeda all the time back in Toronto. That's definitely not Andromeda. Let's try it again. I didn't I swear, - this things got a mind of its own. It goes to my coordinates then it decides to find its own. Same right Ascension and declination. It's so odd. Why don't we get some astrophotos? Why? Why not? just take some astrophotos, please? Okay, right Alex. All right, I'll have this overgrown microscope checked out in the morning. Thanks. Hey, Dave. Yeah. You'll need that. If you ever want to point the scope to those same coordinates again. We have it on the hard drive. Yes, but it's always good to have a backup. Hey Alex..... Yeah,? Get a day job. So if you're a Virgo, does that make you a Virgo? Yes, and if you can read each other's minds. Can you read our minds? No. That's probably a good thing. Be nice. Find out what I'm thinking later. Hey, where you going? I'll be right back. But you will prosper in bed. You all right,? What were you thinking? David, here's the photos from the other night. It doesn't look like much but I forgot to give them to you last night. Is this exactly where the scope was pointing? Yeah, nothing in these. Maybe you discovered a black hole or an invisible star? I'm going down the cafeteria. You want to join me? Wait a minute. What did you say? Wanna join me? an invisible star.... This is my Star (Song). There is no visible evidence on the astrophotos of any Planet there does appear to be something at those coordinates as we have a magnetic disturbance. So what are we looking at? Do we have a star that doesn't emit light, a planet that doesn't reflect ligh,t some form of dark matter, or some form of invisible Planet. My research will include studying the exact coordinates off the computer program disc at the time of Discovery and the exact telescope position at that same time 23:13. Ladies. This is gonna be good. For you.... I'd like a little well done. I hope you do as well. Oh, God bless the cloning Department -- life is good. Be right back. Gonna get better... Dinner is served Stargazer. Thank you. What the hell is wrong with you? Haven't said a word all day. Joey. I think I made a major discovery. What? Remember when I said that I thought the telescope had developed a mind of its own. Yeah, that you're obsessed with your research as usual. Well when the telescope kept repositioning itself to the exact same coordinates, I had Alex take some astrophotos He just made a major Discovery! Joey, Come on. Give it up. Turns out the telescope kept pointing at what appears to be an invisible planet? I mean there's nothing in the photographs but when I did computer enhancement, there's something there. I mean, it's like the telescope was trying to tell me something You mean you may have discovered a new planet. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'm not sure yet. And if it is a planet it's not like any planet in our solar system. It's also generating a radio transmission or at least a radio transmission is coming from the direction of the coordinates. This is freaking awesome and you found this first? Well, I guess found me. You should tell the world. Oh, yeah got a lot more research to do. I can't I announce anything until I know I'm sure Wow. We know a famous astrologer. Astronomer. I'm not famous This calls for a celebration. you are getting liquored up my friend! I am? Yeah. Whoo. Planet David COSMIC LOVE SONG PLAYING Hey, Where you going? Gonna go for a walk. What the hell is wrong with you? We got two hot chicks here, and you're ignoring them. Ah, Joey.... I've never been in love. We're not talking about love -- we're talking about twins. I'm not interested in Vickie. You have Jennifer then. Thanks, but what's the difference? They're not what I'm looking for. What are you looking for? Oh, my dream girl. There's this beautiful woman...... She's the most beautiful woman in the world. .....flowing hair, mysterious eyes, and a smile That would make you melt. Who is she? I don't know. I haven't met her yet. You know, you're not going to find love through a telescope. Cosmic Love! PLAYFUL SCREAMS Hey, where the hell you been? You're going to need a compass to find a way back to my place. Hello? You're freaking me out here. The beers are getting warm The girls are getting cold. She's beautiful. Who's beautiful. She's here. Who's here David? She's here. She was here. I mean, I saw her You saw her? Right? She was right here. She smiled at me. Sorry. Hey, you know a few beers and you'll see anything. No Joey. She was here. Did you get her number? Come on, I can't handle these two by myself. Go. Cosmos what did you do the TV. I did see you in the forest last night...? No, don't go away. I'll be right down. No, no, no. Don't disappear, please. Please don't disappear again. Who are you? I am Misty. Hi Misty. My name is David. How do you know my name? I know a lot about you. You look so familiar. Wait wait, please. please you're just one big mystery, aren't you? I promise I won't ask any more questions. Oh, yeah gotta see the sky at night Crystal Clear is so beautiful and see everything. I've been staring at the sky for as long as I can. remember. I know, you spent a lot of nights on your parents roof with your 60 millimeter telescope staring at the stars, but you weren't always staring at the stars. I wasn't? Cindy Carlson looked mighty tempting under high magnification. Did Joey tell you that. Joey didn't have to tell me that David? Why not? You work for the FBI? I would have had to work for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police David. That was in Canada. look at I don't know how you know what you know, but I know of this great little diner the Diner yeah, with the quaint little chairs. and Sassy waitress with the foul mouth. That's the one, but it's not that way. It's this way. You finish that Henry. I'll shove it down your throat. Hon, find a seat if you can. Good Luck. I'm waiting for someone. How did you beat me here? You didn't think I'd be here. You do have a way of Disappearing. So I thought maybe you're giving me the boot that is needless. You have lovely boots. What do you do? I dream. All right Cowboy. You know what you're having. What, is there water shortage? Can we have another glass please? We must be thirsty. Well, yes, we are. You know what you're going to have. I'm not having anything. You think I'd eat at this joint Do you? Well, I think I'm going to have the double burger special with extra pickles and a chocolate shake. double special extra pickles chocolate shake. You? that woman's got issues. I'll show you something. I know this little trick. I know some magic. Pick a card. Queen of Hearts. from the deck pick a card. Tell me when to stop. Stop. Don't tell me what it is. I already told you Queen of Hearts. I don't believe it. You don't believe anything. You do magic? The magic of believing. TRUCK HORN BLARING So until I enhance the astrophotos it was nothing to see. Besides Joey, you're the only one I've told. I told you last time you can't park your truck in the fire lane. You'll have to move it. I'll movie it when I'm ready Be right back. Are you sure? You can't announce a major Discovery until you're sure it is one? Yeah. No, but I am sure. I have this feeling -- but you're right. I can't David there's something I have to tell you. Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt but uh, would you be a gentleman and let me and my gal sit here? You can sit over there by the counter. Well, excuse me, but we're sitting here. I'm trying to tell you. What I was going to tell you is that there are two of us and one of you. Now move! David, let's go. No! l, We were here first. I'm not going to let some overgrown ape tell us what to do. No Rex, no more trouble. Get out now before I call the sheriff I'm with my little lady. All we want is a little dinner -- and as for you APPLAUSE I don't wanna ever see you in here again! Whoa! I wanted to make a little bit of sense -- not always what they appear. What are you talking about? I saw what I saw. David, you are the only one who can see me . What? Misty! Car!!! David. I am part of your discovery. Song: COMFORTABLE DENIAL Good morning, cosmos... I wasn't dreaming. Good morning. These people are so two dimensional. Thanks for breakfast. I thought this was only a dream. We are dream Partners. We all those years all those dreams were real. I am from the dream Galaxy. We too dream, and like you we know the people in our dreams exist. David, you are the man I dream of. Wow..... My planet is a parallel environment to yours. Although we are 300,000 years more advanced than your civilization. So even though we're light-years apart -- physically we're together. I cannot remain here for very long. Why not? At home, my body is sleeping. It cannot sleep forever. I still don't understand it.. Like, how did you get here? Where is your spaceship? Your mind is my spaceship. That's why I'm the only one who could see you. It was I who directed the telescope. The ground scope. That's why Alex couldn't control the ground scope -- because you were playing with it. I used the telescope to contact you. It was my path of travel to your mind. Hmm. Why did you come if couldn't stay? It was an experiment. I didn't know if it would really work to be here with you before you were only a dream to me. I wanted to make that dream a reality, short as that may be. it'd be impossible in coming here. Now find a way for you to stay. What is that creature? You mean the Bumblebee? Bumblebee, it goes from flower to flower pollinating. It is beautiful. Actually. It's scientifically impossible for a bumblebee to fly.... ..... because of its .....body mass. Compared to its wings. Then, why does it fly? Because it believes that it can -- doesn't know that it can't. Kids crazy talking to himself. What's the world coming to Harvey? I can't wait to show you my research. so far May I see your... Oh, hey, Dr. Summers. Hi Roger. working days again. I'm coming in to catch up on some work. You up all day up all night -- when you guys sleep. Who is he? He's a security guard. Excuse me. Well, I said you're a security guard. The magnification on the scope is phenomenal. I'm sure you've never seen anything like it, you know, maybe you can help decipher some of the data collected on your planet. You're going to attract attention. Try thought-talking to me. Think out loud what you want to say without moving your lips. Hi Misty... Good! Hi David, what are you doing here? So early in the day? Just here to research some ah, research. Well, I got to run late for an appointment. Keep your fingers crossed. sure. What am I Crossing them for? Dr. Melvin still trying to divert funds from the ground scope to his satellite program. THOUGHT TALK: Stop that! He can't do that. He's got to convince the private investors first, and they don't see a future in the satellite at this time. Wish me luck. See you tomorrow. Bye doctor. Stop that. Cut that out. What's happening to you? My energy, I have to conserve my energy. I need to rest. You'll be all right? Yes, I'm fine. I'll be fine. I promise. You're coming back right, tonight? It's a date. Wait, Song: I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO. Song: I don't want you to leave now. Now I want you to cry I never wanted to let you down (Song) David, How is that new planetary research coming? I've been a little busy. I haven't had time to work on. Well, I hope these help. I need the most current research on electrospheres - is this it? Why are you so interested in electrospheres? all of a sudden? I'm in love with a dream. Huh? What would you say if you met a woman who no one could see or hear? And you couldn't touch. I'd say goodbye!!! Remember the other night I could swear I saw woman. Your dream girl. Yeah, right. Her name is Misty and she's from the Dream Galaxy. Sounds like she's a little geographically undesirable. That planet I discovered, it generates an unusual amount of neutrinos. Now. I've read that there's a connection, some connection between the Neutrinos and Eletrospheres You're an expert on Electrospheres What's the connection, how do they work? Some think it's that neutrinos are a byproduct of Electro spheric transmissions. Well, what powers the electrospheres. Well, it's all very random. But there is a possibility that you know the energy in a thought produces its own materialization. Okay, like in Voice transmission -- cell phone, the voice is broken down on one end converted into electrons and reconverted into sound on the other end. If you can do that with you know, with a voice, then they think someday you can do that with solid matter. Joey, is the human mind capable of powering Electrospheres? Well, you know science hasn't really captured and tapped.. into enough energy in the human brain. Can electrospheres transport someone over vast distances? Have you ever thought about seeing a shrink? David, this is just a theory, you know, this isn't real and if it did work, it work on tangible items, not some imaginary dream girl. Well, it's time for someone to prove it. David! She doesn't exist! How many stars? (song) How fast the sky how many dreams begin how many die? (Song) Down on the were waiting for me through time and space out there a star shine sprinkled with Dawn. That's the scene for lovers to love. Maybe Joey's right -- I'm going crazy. Hi. Did I startle you? Yeah, yeah little. You're still transparent. You sure know how to flatter a girl. You know, for for some reason I thought maybe tonight. I could hold you. I'm on a time limit remember? Song: A MILLION MILES AWAY Yes! Checkmate! Aha...... I see that. That's the third time. You said you never played before. I learn fast. The mind is more powerful than you think. You have to believe more in yourself. Well, I don't know what to believe anymore. Do you believe in me? I want to believe in you. I want to touch you. I want others to see you. I want proof. Of you. Uhmm, Joey teaches about the theory of electorspheres in his physics class. It's maybe theoretically possible with Electrospheres. to bring more than just your soul here. But how is that possible? Well, it has to do with physical matter. It has to do with molecular structures in the transference of them from place to place or dimension to dimension. And after all the Earth is just sort of another dimension from your planet. That is only a theory. No one has ever proven that theory. Well first time for everything. David.... I cannot remain here for very long. My soul is weakening. No one from my planet has ever made contact with their dream partner before. No one's ever had to figure out how to stay here on a one-way ticket? I am not able to stay. You have to go. I cannot return. What, what are you telling me? I have projected my physical image in an astral form. My soul cannot remain here this way. My physical body will die. Wha,t you came here on a, on a suicide visit? I wanted to be with you. Well you're not going to die. I won't let you die. What about the telescope? I mean it worked to get you here? Why don't we just reverse the process and send you home. It would need to be a direct Astro path when the planets are aligned. I have your address. I have your coordinates on my disk. It would have to be an exact path, the path. I came in on. The exact path that you came in on. Well, all we have to do is..... Offset the telescope coordinates by the differential and time to account for the change in Earth's rotation. An earth day is not 24 hours long. It's tor 23 hours 56 minutes and 49 seconds Oh you're so cute. It's one of those things I need to know. So, okay. So all we have to do.... is.... set the telescope. To your planet's coordinates, but do so approximately eight minutes earlier than when we did. And that will clear a direct path to return your astral image to your physical body on your planet -- the exact path that you took getting here. Hmm, I do not have much time left. You've got to Believe. Hmmmm. (on TV) .....displaced residents of a byward market apartment fire. Come on David. Listen to yourself. I think you're working overtime. I believe you're having hallucinations. Next thing You're going to tell me is that you're being visited by purple elephant's wearing tutus. Oh, Joey, I don't know what I think. I think, and it's just my opinion That you have an overactive imagination ever since you made this discovery. But I could swear that she's..... Well, I can almost swear that she's real. See, you said almost. Do you have any proof? Yeah. No. She's in your head. Joey maybe, I'm crazy. I rest my case. Ben, please would you make this a triple? Thank you. ON TV: Dr. Howard Melvin an astronomer at the prestigious Observator facility.. Hey, Ben, can you turn this up? Announced his new findings earlier today. The Observator One satellite...when it's launched into space next week... (on TV) Very exciting funding has been completed for the launch powered Melvin's space-age satellite The Observatron One will allow him to continue his research and complete his research on what may be the first planet ever to sustain life outside. our own. The board of directors have agreed that it's time to launch my satellite into space to get a closer look at my exciting new research. Melvin may qualify for the very prestigious Carl Sagan award for his discovery of a possible new world and along with that a cash award close to Half a million dollars. This is Katie Longstreet reporting live at River science. I don't believe it. He stole my research! My notes, my formulas, my photos! I told you to make photocopies of your written notes. It's alright, you have the disk. You have the disk? Right? without the disk it will take you years before you find the same spot in the sky. He stole everything. Okay, he's got my tape recorder. He's got the astrophotos photos. All my notes. We have it on the hard drive? The techs erased the hard drive the day they came in to test the Scopes malfunction. Alex, you could lose your job for this. Thanks... Alright now get out of here. Go! Hmm?! DOOR OPENS Alex, I told you.... Do you find my files interesting Dr. Sommers? Like I told you doctor... this man is out to steal my research Your research? Dr. Hudson.. Sommers -- I'll see you in my office. Tik. Aha. I'm afraid I have no other choice but to terminate your employment here at Observator. I was just trying to retrieve files that were mine. I'd like to believe you David, but you intruded on Dr. Melvin's property. Damn it. He stole my research. Your research? Yes. Give me a moment. I'll explain. I'm sorry, David. Hey, hey! You're Dr. Sommers? Yeah? We have orders to escort you from the premises. Orders? Whose orders. I got to pack my things. (Song) SOME THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND. what was I thinking. LOUD CRICKETS I'm sorry. I didn't know that you would mistake my coming to you through the scope as a scientific finding. How did you know that Melvin's.....? Of course, you're in my head. You are angry because your research was stolen. Is there anything I can do? Why do you not respond to me? David? You're not real. I thought you believed in me. I believe in you. I'm losing my mind. You're a figment of my imagination. What if I am. What does it matter as long as we believe in each other. Isn't there security in knowing that maybe I am real? You're not real. What is reality? Come on Cosmos. Song: SOMETHING IN THE RAIN What is reality? What is reality? BEE BUZZING BEE BUZZING THOUGHT: It's scientifically impossible for a bumblebee to fly because Then, why does it fly? Because it believes that it can. Hey, hey! Take it easy will ya! You want your research back don't you? Okay, go....go....go Password? No one told me about a password. Joey... I thought I told you to never call me here..... Joey, he's password-protected the files. I can't get in. Would you just take the disk? I can't find the disk. I gotta have those exact coordinates or Misty will die Can you stop babbling this Misty stuff, you're gonna get us caught We gotta have the telescope reposition my exactly 23:05 to clear a direct path to her planet. I'm helping you to get your research back. What time is it? It's 22:38, so hurry! Yeah. Got it! Hey! Haa, ehh.... Hey! This is Edwards..... I need assistance! ALARMS GOING OFF Sorry! You alright? I think......? POLICE SIRENS ALARMS STILL GOING OFF David, what are you doing here? What the Hell is going on? I don't have time to explain we've got 45 seconds to save her Save who? Humour him. Bring up my program. From the disk. Why is the scope not on....... Alex? Power up the scope. Power up Power up the scope.... Power up the scope! Dr. Melvin shut down the program this morning -- the Scope's dead. CLOCK BEEPS I'm sorry David. Police, move away from the console now. DR. Sommers, you're trespassing. LOUD ELECTRICAL SWITCH TURNING SWITCH BACK ON The only way out is the elevator. AHHHHH! Put yourself in my position. I want to believe you. I couldn't save her. Yeah but you saved your Discovery. Won't Melvin be surprised when he goes to boot up the program and he sees nothing but a blank screen. I couldn't get into his computer. Remember I couldn't erase the files. Damnit! That means coordinates are still on the hard drive. LOUD BUMP Get some rest pal tomorrow things will look brighter. I swear. Misty? Misty? I guess I missed my ride. I'm so sorry. You tried David. That's what matters. If the discovery is announced Dreams will be broken. My civilization is not ready to make themselves known to your world. I am so sorry David. I should never have crossed the Stars. CRASH Damn, it. You can't die. I've been waiting for you all of my life. I know your fears David, you have brought them with you into our dreams. All these years I've been unable to love. Afraid of the pain of losing someone close to me. Never stop believing. I finally accepted the fact that I love you. Now you're going to leave me. I have always loved you David. always. Misty.... Misty.... Song, ONCE IN A WHILE..... Who is that? Sommers? what the hell are you doing here? You didn't think I was gonna let you just get away with this. Did you? You don't have a job anymore. You're trespassing. Leave or I'll call the police. You can't expect to steal my research and have me sit back and watch you take credit for it. I don't know what you're talking about. You stole more than my research Doctor. Let me tell you something Sommers. I am well respected in this field, have been for 20 years you squeal to whoever you want. Who will they believe, you or me? Good night. Want to talk about it? There isn't a story I haven't heard. Heh..... You do magic. I wish. RINGING (Recoding) Hi, this is Joey and Omni. We're not here right now, So please leave a message after my Beep -- Beep!. Hey, Joey. I really need to talk to you. I uhm, I have been fooling myself. I guess I've, I've been living a dream, just now realizing it. This has been a dream. TURNS OFF PHONE Song, SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT MOVING ON.... I ADMIT I WAS WRONG...... I've been waiting for this such a long time that the time (Song) is coming like the lucky one.. . ever since the day I was a young boy, living in my dreams... HORN HONKS Ha, Ha - David! Oh man. I've been driving around all night. I thought I'd have to rotate my tires. Hi, Joey. Glad to see you. I got your message. I thought you were going to do something drastic. Well, I'm okay.. You been up all night? Yeah, everything is gonna be Okay. All right, come on get in, Let's go. Song, WAS IT JUST MY OWN IMAGINATION.... So, what's up? She's not gone I can still feel her. But the message you left on my answering machine. I thought you came to terms with all this. I have. She's real. Believe me. She's real, take a look at this. It's a rock. It's a meteorite. I was nine when I found this with my grandfather. That's what got me interested in astronomy in the first place good for you. That's a beautiful story. It vanished 25 years ago when I gave it to Misty in a dream one night. And it appeared out of nowhere here -- today. Misty said those dreams were real. I finally have tangible evidence that she's real. Sure that thing didn't fall from the sky and hit you in the head. This went into her world and this morning came back. You know meteorites aren't unique -- thousands of them hit the Earth all the time. With my initials on them. Huh... Hey, stop the car. What now? I can still save her. You told me it would be too late If we missed with the telescope. She used the path of the ground scope to direct her image here. Yeah, but the ground scope is dead pal. Observatron One. I bet we can use Observatron one to catch her astral image and project it home. Yeah, but then you still have to reprogram the satellite to the proper coordinates. I have the disc. I have the coordinates. All we need is access to the satellite. Yeah, I know I know but I gotta do something. I mean if I don't it's like pulling the plug I'll never know if I could have saved her. Come on... Joey, we've known each other since I was in second grade. You know, I'm not crazy. Will you help? to keep my dream alive? Well, the launch is tomorrow night. I must be a real moron. Harrison Bosloy flight crew. Flight crew? Thompson here please reveal details on flight crew over. OMNI: Flight crew. Correct. Two Astronauts. OMNI: Two astronauts, correct. Okay, no problem, sir. OMNI: Okay. No problem. Go ahead colonel Bosloy. I'm Harrison. He's Bosloy. You guys all look alike to us. OMNI: Okay, no problem. Cute little fellow. OMNI: Thank you! OMNI: See you later alligator.

OMNI: Thank you. DAVID: Shhhhh... JOEY: Me and my yellow screwdriver. CLANK OMNI: Okay, no problem. CLANK. We should have been locksmiths. So now all we gotta do is change the direction of the orbital disk. We can dial up your so-called girlfriend. Disc. All I gotta do.... change each of the coordinates to make up for the difference in right Ascension.... OMNI: Correct! OMNI: Two astronauts, correct. Can you keep your little friend quiet. Shhh. THUMP OMNI: Okay. No problem. Now can break up with your invisible girlfriend so that we can go home. No. Couple more coordinates and we're there. I believe you gentlemen are trespassing. I should thank you very much for helping me get my baby launched. I would split the achievement prize with you but, You won't be around to spend it. OMNI: Okay. No problem. Run Joey, run! David, go, go, I got him David.... Go, go, go.... Whoa..... OMNI: See you later alligator. Maintenance reports she is fueled and ready. Meteorology? SPEAKER: No signs of winds were good to go. This is Colonel Burk. We have T minus 20 and Counting. If you will, excuse me, but I have a press conference to attend. Au revoir.... (thought-talk) What have I done? Gone crazy. My hallucinations for a girl who doesn't exist has put me in this situation. My best friend is going to die in a satellite. What am I doing thought-talk. Yeah right -- Okay imaginary girlfriend.. get me out of this one. PHONE RINGING Hello. David? Dr. Melvin has locked Joe Woodruff in the Observertron satellite. You've got to stop the launch. Okay, David. Thanks for letting me know. Dr. Hudson. I'm telling the truth Joe's going to be dead in ten minutes If you don't stop the launch. Only, Dr. Melvin can stop the launch. I got to run good night, David. Damnit! POLICE SIRENS Sweeeet! We have lift off in....two minutes and twenty seconds. Thank you very much for this award. Oh ho ho.... And with the Observatron One satellite, I will be able to delve deeper into the studies of my Discovery with this new..... And with this new... TAP, TAP, TAP. Ahhh? CLICK SMASH! TIRES SQUEALING Ahhhh..... Ahhhhhh.... Ahhhh, help.....oh my god... CARN HORN We have ignition in 1 minute 16 seconds. Stop the launch now. Make the call and stop the launch or else. Stop the launch or else what? Surprise! Haaaa - PUNCH Good one! Yeah! KICK Owww. Oooh.... Ooooh. TIRES SCREECHING In 10..... 9..8....7..6..5.. Surprise!!! WHOOP! 2.. .1.... and ignition. EXPLOSION Joey.... CROWD CHATTER Where the hell is Melvin? Don't know. We are live at The Observator complex in Mount Riverside. Just moments ago space Hawk Industries launched Observatron One into orbit. Dr. Howard Melvin. the Pioneer behind the satellite will be presented the Galileo award equivalent to the Pulitzer Prize given by the astronomical Committee of Washington. Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to introduce to you the director of Observatron's launch program. Dr. Howard Melvin. APPLAUSE CAMERA SHUTTER Thank you very much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen of the Press. Thank you very much for coming here this evening. I would also like to thank our board of directors and the investors for being responsible for the launch of Observatron One to-night. APPLAUSE Last week while making a routine observation with the traditional ground telescope. I observed a new point of light that had gone unnoticed. While I we were not be able to verify this with our conventional Earth ground telescope with the new Observatron One satellite I believe we will find life on the planet I have discovered. APPLAUSE HORNS HONKING What's the hold up? Observatron One will revolutionize astronomer studies to view the stars and with my new discovery. The satellite will be able to explore beyond what we had ever imagined. APPLAUSE I thank you all for this award. CAR HORNS And with Observatron One Satellite, we will be able to delve deeper into the studies of my discovery. APPLAUSE Thank you. There is no discovery. CROWD - WHAT? AUDIENCE CHATTER Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Melvin hasn't discovered anything. What he has done is lock an innocent man in his satellite and blast him into space. Dr. Melvin has feigned a new discovery in order to fund the launch of his precious satellite into orbit. Dr. Melvin feins nothing. How would you know anything about my Discovery. You know I know. Get him out of here. This man's a lunatic look at him in his orange space suit. You're not going to get away with it. Get this astro-nut out of here. Let go of me! What's the hold up? Come-on, move it.... OMNI: Greetings, take us to your leader. Nooo. He's the one who's nuts. I'm so sorry for the interruption. Observertron One will be able to see objects. Light Years away. This will enable me to get a closer look at my Discovery and the life that inhabits it. APPLAUSE Excuse me. Dr. Melvin... May I speak. You may have the floor. Thank you, but you may keep the floor. Dr. Melvin. I majored in astronomy in college. I have reviewed your research as noted in your press release and I believe Dr. Summers is correct. By the coordinates listed in your press release and related materials. It appears that your research actually indicates a light Reflection on the Astrophotos. AUDIENCE GASPS That's impossible. I'm Henry Krauss from astronomers monthly. Yes, she is correct. CROWD GASPS She's right these coordinates of the photos show a common declination and right Ascension. Now if we convert them to longitude and latitude, it appears that he's actually discovered, New Jersey. CROWD: New Jersey? New Jersey... And Dr. Melvin, I believe we have some video footage which will substantiate your true intentions. Jerry, roll that tape, please (on monitor) I should thank you very much for helping me get my baby launched. I would split the achievement prize with you, but you won't be around around to spend. Run Joey, Run... Get em, get em....David...... I got him......run David... Go...go.... CROWD UPROAR Scuse me, excuse me.... Scuse me... GET HIM! GET HIM! So here's a discovery.... real stars. Yes? Oh, I'm sorry.... I thought you were somebody else... David! Joey Joey, Joey! I think I have your girlfriend to thank. Hey! Welcome back! Ha, ha. It's good to see you. I should have believed you David. I'm not sure I would have believed it. Well doctor. I got a lot of things to figure out here. See you at work on Monday. Monday. Work on Monday? Work on Monday. I got my job back! There's a lot of confusion here at the press conference tonight. We expected the announcement of a new planet with life discovered by Dr. Howard Melvin, but now it seems that Dr. Melvin may have life, in prison. This is Betty Baker Reporting Live, back to you Jim. JOEY LAUGHING I don't know how or what happened back there. But that was awesome!!! Hey David, believe in your dreams. BOOM! Heeyah! Hey Cosmos, you hungry? How about some company? Thank you. For what? For rescuing Joey? I may have helped a little. Look I don't care if you're just a dream to me. I've never needed anything more in my life. You'll ways be in my heart. What brought you back? I never left. Always been here. Your strength is the reason. I thought you couldn't stay? I thought your body would die if your soul didn't return. It's dying as we speak. You know, sometimes you have to believe in something, Before it becomes reality. THEME: MILLION MILES AWAY (Song) I wrote these words when I lay in my bed with all those thoughts (song) running through my head. I can't let go, let life go on... Oh, Baby You were gone for so long. A million miles away from me.......to Earth.... And now that you are back with me, love has begun.
