- [woman 1] Ready, Father? - [man 1] Always ready. - [man 1] Come on, give me another number! - [woman 1 gasps] - [woman 1] Uh-- - [man 1] Fast! - [woman 1] Uh... okay. Two, zero... - [man 1] Hurry up! zero, three, nine, eight, five, seven, six... uh... - divided by 73! - [man 1] Hmm. [woman 1] Go! - [all] Five! Four! - [woman 1] One sec, one sec! I'm trying! - [all] Three! - I'm trying to divide it. - Done! [chuckles] - [woman 2] Awesome, uncle! - [kids scream] - [woman 2] Faster than a calculator! - [all cheering and laughing] - [man 2] Jesus... - but that was cool! - [woman 1] Yeah. - [man 2] Check it, check it! Is it right? - [man 1] Yes! - [man 1 laughs] - [man 2] You! Oh... - [woman 1 sighs] - damn! [man 1] Aw... [woman 1 chuckles] - [soft music playing] - [woman 1 breathes shakily] [woman 1] She spoke to him clearly... through her big... brown... baby eyes. "I know I still can't walk, Papa... but I'd sure like to try." He knew that needed her... to be stronger than she could be. "But stand up and walk," he said. "Don't take your eyes off me." So, she beamed as she stood up... on her tiny little feet. And wobbled towards him falling... but wouldn't accept defeat. She flung her arms around him... and she giggled with delight. He made her believe she could do anything... and ignited her will to fight. But walking was too simple now... and she really wanted to run. So, he stepped aside and cheered her on. His molding of her was done. I know that now I'm older, Dad... and I can walk on my own. But the roads I choose and the paths I take, are the ones that you have shown. So, thank you, Dear Dad... for teaching me like you do. I am but a fragment of who you are... and a striking reflection of you. [feel-good music playing] [cell phone beeps] [inhales deeply] [exhales sharply] [coughs] [coughs again] [inhales deeply] [sighs] [scoffs] Babe, go to sleep! Shh! [whispers] Sleep. [scoffs] [rhythmic music playing] [exhales] [sniffs] [kid on tape] "Ah," said the piggy. "That's not fair!" "Oh," said the engine driver. "I don't care!" [chuckles] - [woman] Hi! - Oh! - Morning! - You're already ready? Weren't you supposed to be sleeping? Huh? - Mandira's shoot, baby! - [sniffs] - Gotta get there before she calls. - Good... - morning, baby! - Baby, you're sweaty! - Go, shower! - [chuckles] [soft chuckle] What? You couldn't decide what you wanna wear again? Hmm? - ♪ Oh, no... ♪ - Nothing fits. - How was your run? - ♪ See you like a-- ♪ - Oh! Babe, where's my towel? - [scoffs] It's right here, Ishaan... - where it always is! - [sighs] - [Ishaan] Thank you! - Okay, bye now! - Oh, you're leaving? - Yeah. - When are you done? - Good question! [exhales sharply] - You know what, love? - Hmm? I have to fit into these clothes and we need to travel, and maybe have a baby! - [grunts] Alright! - [woman speaks indistinctly] [woman hums] Hmm... fructose? Sucrose? Sucrose it is. [soft music playing] Hi, where's Tanya? Where are the bikes? What are these cycles? Didn't we decide orange? Yeah, okay. Right! - Hi. - Hey! - Alisa! - Yeah? - Uncle's here. - [man] Lighting proper? - Oh! Hi! - [whispers] Hi. Sorry! One sec, one sec. - Huh, what? Sorry! Continue, continue! - [camera clicks] - Yeah, just sit with for him two minutes! - Okay. How's work, Uncle? - Oh! Very busy, dear. Very busy. - Uh... - [cell phone ringing] - oh, I'm so sorry. It's Mandira, I have to take this call. Hello? [in Hindi] Get some tea for Uncle. [in English] Just cool off a little bit. Dab. - Waiting for madam, sir? - Thank you. - Yeah. - Madam is too busy! [birds chirping] Okay. I mean, figure this out because I… I don't know. I mean, I'm-- Eric, what do you feel? Hmm... orange would be much better. Hmm... - Honestly, this model is misbehaving - Yeah, yeah. quite a lot. So, I don't know. ["Ek pal" by Mokshada Batra Tandon playing] - [whispers] Where's he gone? - Huh? Uh, okay. - You know, just say September - Yeah. - and give it to me. - [camera clicks] Mandira, I'm gonna have to, like, call you in a bit. Yeah, that's better. Give-give... yeah. [sighs] - Why did you buy me chocolate? - [crickets chirping] The girls like chocolate, not me. And that too in a cone. I told you twice. I said... - tutti-frutti! - [chomps] Tutti-frutti, tutti-frutti! [soft chuckle] That's thrice, Rita. Not twice. What's the big deal? Anyway, cone is so much more fun! And messy, too! [in Hindi] Yeah, alright! [in English] I'll tell Bahadur to get you tutti-frutti. - You leave this. - No, no, no. Now, don't waste it. Okay, listen. I had to tell you... [exhales sharply] - Hmm? - I spoke to John today. And? And... I leave Tomorrow. - What the hell, Ishaan! - Hey! Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Because I knew you'd react exactly like this. So, I figured I might as well tell you in person - when I came home. - Shut up! If I'd known earlier, then you know I would've-- What? Made another sabzi? - Very funny! - [chuckles] Okay, but listen! I had an idea. - Hmm! - Why don't you come with me? Think about it. We can take a couple of days off. Go to Bali. White sands, blue seas... - coconut drinks. - [chuckles] Coconut water you get here also. - Hey! - [inhales deeply] I can't leave the business, love. [in Hindi] Come on, Rajiv! [in English] Let's go on a holiday! No, before I go to the US. Once I go to the US, - [in Hindi] Anaitha won't leave me. - [low grunt] [in English] You know, I don't have the time... nor the energy. Please, dear! [in Hindi] Now, Ishaan is going to Singapore. [in English] I don't want to leave Ali alone. Then, we'll take Ali with us! [scoffs] You know today, I went to visit her at the set. She didn't even have five minutes for me. You think she'll have time to come for a holiday? You know her. That's why you're in this mood, huh? I guess we'll have to Skype like the old days. - [Ishaan moans] Mm-hmm! - [cell phone ringing] - Baby, come on! - Shit! - Don't pick that up, please? - I have to take this. Hi, Tan! - Are you serious? - [whispers] Five minutes! - [normal voice] Yeah. - [scoffs] - Okay! - [Ishaan whispers] God! [in Hindi] Come on, let's go! [in English] We'll go! Rita, I've told you a 100 times. I don't have the time. You know, I'm trying to sell the restaurant. These buyers are going back and forth, back and forth. I'm trying to consolidate. Then, consolidate fast! You know there's no such thing as the perfect buyer. And with you, I don't think it's a question of the buyer. I think, it's a question of you not being able to let go. How's your chocolate? Very chocolaty! [chuckles] You want another ice cream? Yes... tutti-frutti, and in a cup! Now, write that down! Sorry. [kisses] It'd be nice if we had one evening to ourselves, without your phone. I know. Sorry! I had to take this call, love. Between these vendors and Tanya, I just feel-- Babe, Tanya can wait! Okay, you're right! Just give me one second, I've to send her this contact. Babe, your phone can wait! We were talking about taking a holiday. Okay... but it's not so simple, Ishaan. I mean, I have to be on call 24-7. It's the nature of my business. Wait a second! You think you're the only person in the world who works like this and the rest of us just walk in and out of office and switch on and off like robots? I'm not saying that, Ishaan. I'm just saying that you have no idea what my life is like! Yeah, you're right! Ali, I have no idea what your life is like. But you have to understand that it impacts me, too! What impacts you? This! This whole world you've created for yourself! Ali, you realize you have no time for anything other than work? - [scoffs] - You have no time for yourself. You have no time for Dad, and you sure as shit have no time for us! Ishaan, I just spent hours cooking a meal-- Baby, but that's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't need that! I need you! But you have me-- But it doesn't feel like that anymore now, does it? [both sigh] And even that! Babe, if you had made a simple pasta and salad, I would've been happy, but no! You have to make dal and roti and knead your own dough! Why are you always tryin' to make life - difficult for yourself? - [scoffs] Huh! That's ridiculous, Ishaan. You know... - I'm not trying to do that. - You know what? One second! You say this all the time, so I'm gonna say this now! You have put on weight. You've let yourself go! Jeez, you're always cranky and crabby and you're not sleeping! Come on, babe! It's really simple. If you're feeling unfit, go to the gym! If you're not sleeping, go see Dr. Dev. Ishaan... I know exactly what I need to do with my life. I just don't have the time! [shouts] And I'm not your bloody project! Oh, believe you me! I have no intentions of making you my project! Contrary to popular belief, I have enough going on in my own life! Then, back the hell off, alright? I'll fix myself, dude! I'll take care of myself! - Huh! - And honestly if you can't stand to see... whatever I've become, or whatever you think I've become if you can't stand to see me like this, then just leave me alone! - Leave? - [angrily] Yeah! [scoffs] There you go! [inhales deeply] You know what? I am going to leave! Because I get no joy in this house! You're leaving? - Yeah, I'm getting out! - [grunts] Why have you locked this door? I've told you a 100 times, don't lock this door and you never listen! - Where are you going? - I don't know! To hell, maybe! How mature! Fine! Bye! Go! [shouts] Wear your goddamn seat belt, Ishaan! - [Ishaan] I'll think about it! - [exhales sharply] ["Ek pal" by Mokshada Batra Tandon playing] ♪ One moment... ♪ ♪ Has countless joys ♪ ♪ One moment that all long for ♪ ♪ One moment That slips through like sand ♪ - [in English] Hi! - Hi! What's up, Ali? Hmm? What happened? Boy problem? [exhales sharply] Nothing, Papa. You go sleep. You know what, Ali? As much as I enjoy these midnight chats with you over nothing... if you have a problem, tell me, please! What is it? Nothing! This Ishaan... is so... annoying! I mean I don't understand it, Pa. He's so hot and cold. One day he acts like I'm his wife, and the next day, he just disappears! Fine, we had some stupid fight over God only knows what! But he's not picking up my calls and he's not even responding to my text messages. He acts as if I'm stalking him or something and... I don't know he's got into this trip of "I want my space." I mean what does that even mean? - What does that even-- - Slow down! Slow down! Slow down! How many times have you called him? Today? [sighs] - Like only seven or eight times. - [chuckles] But there was a gap of ten minutes in between each call, and between 11 and 12... I was talking to Neha. So, I didn't even call him that time. And you know what, Pa? After I spoke to Neha, I called him and his phone was on call waiting. That means, he saw my call coming in and he still didn't pick up my call! You know what, Ali? To me, it seems like you've been stalking him. - [scoffs] - Why don't you just leave him alone? Boys need their space. Just let him be. The more you chase him, the more he's gonna ignore you. That's all I'm saying! You know what? Why don't you just pick up the phone and message him? Tell him you're sorry and you'll talk later. Why should I message him, Papa? It's his fault! He's the one who should message me and say sorry to me! It's not about whose fault it is, dear. It's going to make you feel better, so do it! Come on, message him! No, no, no, Pa! If I message him first, if I say sorry first, then he's gonna get all egoistic. And... like he's gonna have the upper hand and stuff. You've called him a 100 times. [soft chuckle] He already has the upper hand. [sighs] You know what, Ali? Sometimes, relationships are like punching bags. Sometimes you're the puncher, and sometimes you're the bag. But, when you're the puncher... you need to know when to stop. Because when you keep punching, - then the bag will-- - The bag will break. Not break, tear! - The bag will break, Papa, from the top. - [scoffs] [sighs] It will tear. Okay? You just message him. [Alisa scoffs] - [groans] - Come on! Do it, dear. Here... [in Hindi] Come on! [in English] Take it. [Alisa sighs] Good. That's my girl. [soft piano music playing] And you know what? I'll tell you something. He's definitely gonna call you back. Don't pick up his call. [inhales] Just ignore him. Don't answer his calls for a day. - [Alisa chuckles] - What's he saying? - Huh? - What? Tell me. Nothing. [crickets chirping] [cell phone beeps] Hi, Pa. I told you I'll call you back. Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming to see you tomorrow. [fast-paced music playing] [horn honks] [ebullient music playing] - Papa! - Huh? Ali! What are you doing here? You don't have shoot or what? Papa, I called you last night. I told you I was coming for some time. You did? [scoffs] What are you doing here in the middle of the day? You don't have work or what? Hey, I have a lot of work. I'm just taking a break. Papa! - What? - Your zip is open! [Rajiv exhales sharply] - What are you doing? - [man in Hindi] Ma'am, lunch. Yes, yes. Keep it there, thank you. [in English] Okay, please! Extend your break for me. Come. - Yes, just-- - I need your help. - [Rajiv sighs] - Can't figure out this math thing. Tell me, tell me! So, obviously I charge my clients service tax. - Right? - Hmm. Now, one of these clients... for some reason, their statement is not tallying with mine. - There seems to be some discrepancy. - [exhales sharply] [stammers] I can't figure out what it is. - You have both the statements? - Yeah, yeah. [clunk] Give me! Yeah, I'll solve it for you in a minute! Thanks, Pa! Accountants these days, I tell you they're all duffers! - That's why, I came to you. - [whispers] 76, 24... -34, 6... - [click-clack] [sighs] 108... eight forward.

Stop irritating me, please! - Huh? Now, I have to start all over again. Just distracted me totally! Why are you getting so irritated? - Huh? - I have to concentrate. Why do you have to concentrate? You're doing math. - Just give me my calculator. - No! Just pass me my calculator-- Why do you need a calculator, Pa? Do it yourself! Because-- Just give it to me! Okay! Chill, chill. [Alisa] Grumpy bear! Simply, you know, just... Here, take your calculator. [click-clack] [cell phone ringing] [Alisa] Oh, goodness! I have to take this. Finish fast now! You have a calculator. Hello? [soft guitar music playing] This is ridiculous I tell you! Rubbish! [sighs] Can't understand what these people do! God, this Mandira! [sighs] Hey, already eating? Rice pudding for lunch? - Mm-hmm! - Finished this or no? - [Alisa sighs] - No, dear. It's taking time. Do one thing. - Hmm? - You go home. - What? - We're coming in the night - to see Ishaan off, right? - Yeah. I'll bring it at that time. - Um... - I'll do it, dear. Okay, but, we're going for an early dinner. So, come by ten o'clock, 'cause I've to take him to the airport after that. Hmm? - Agreed? - Where are you going? - Hey, someone has to work. - [grunts] - Come and eat! - Would love to, Pa... - but I have too much to do. - Eat and go, dear. [Alisa kisses] Bye! Enjoy your rice pudding, sorry! - Ali-- - Don't forget to bring that... and stop watering the plants, Pa! - [soft music playing] - [Alisa] Sorry for yesterday. - Hmm! - Bye. [cell phone ringing] - You'll just discuss it, one sec. - Okay. - Hello? - Hi, Ali! I'm on WhatsApp... but I want to make a WhatsApp call. I don't want to chat. I'm at work, Ma. Call Anaitha, please! I'm trying to call Anu, but why should I waste money making international call? Bahadur said WhatsApp calls are free. So, tell me how to do it! Is your internet, your home internet, is that on? Bahadur was cleaning that box [Rita] and I think it stopped working. So, tell me what to do. Mama, I'm at work! I'm in the middle of a meeting! [Alisa] I'll call you in a bit. Actually, one minute! Why did you pack rice pudding for Papa today? Oh, I thought you said you're busy at work now. [Alisa] Mama, how many times have I told you? The man needs to lose weight! Yeah, but a little rice pudding won't kill him. Okay, I don't have time to talk about all that now! Tell me something. Um, did anyone in our family have... Alzheimer's or dementia or any of those diseases? Why are you asking me that now? Just some... some form I'm filling. [Rita] Medical history form? Oh! Are you at the gynec? I'm at work, Mama. But you should be trying, dear. [Rita] You're always at work. This is the time you should be trying-- Ma, tell me fast, no! [Rita] What did you ask me again? Um... [sighs] Yeah, your grandpa had Alzheimer's. Mm-hmm. How old was he when he had it? Maybe, in his late 60's. [Rita] Why are you asking all these questions? What form are you filling? Why do they want so much-- Don't give anybody so much information about our family! [sighs] Ma, I'm... I'm getting back to my meeting, okay? - [Alisa] I'll call you later. - No, no. Ali, one minute! I just wanted to ask you. - I need a color printout for my painting. - [Alisa] Okay... I'm giving the phone to Tanya. - Tanya, just please! - Yeah. - So sorry. Sorry. - [Tanya] Hello? - Location sorted? - Auntie? Hi, Tanya here. - Make sure everything's on email. - [Tanya] Yeah. - [Alisa] Everything's confirmed. - [Tanya] How are you? What's up with you, dude? Why are you so stressed? You haven't been sleeping again? When do I ever sleep? That's the usual! But I wanna talk to you about Papa. You know, every time I've met him in the past few weeks, he's... he's different. Something's off. Dad, though there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. What has happened, son? I really think she needs to see Dr. Dev. She's hardly sleeping... and she's constantly cranky and crabby. Ishaan, all women are cranky and crabby. But not like this, Dad. This is a whole other level! But who is she gonna listen to? [scoffs] Million dollar question! And the other day, I was reading this article on Alzheimer's. And you know Shreya's dad also has Alzheimer's, right? It's damn scary, Anu. I feel like he's heading in that direction. You know he had to use a calculator today for the first time! Like, I've never seen him do this before! And his zip was open! Can you believe that? And you saw, I mean... I messaged him. I called him, and he still forgot to bring the accounts. He never forgets. He's never done this before. Okay... [inhales deeply] Well, I think... that you need a little bit of a distraction. - How about you say hello... - [Alisa sighs] to XYZ, who is asking for a cousin! [Anaitha] How about that? Stop calling her XYZ, man! Come on! It's high time you settle on a name already! [laughs] - Listen, I'm barely making my peace - [chuckles] with the fact that I'm going to be a mother! I don't know what I'm gonna do. And [gasps] name is step two. I, we will get there... soon! [Alisa] Okay, can you just listen to me? - I'm serious! - I know. Grandpa also had Alzheimer's and he's getting really forgetful. [Anaitha] Hmm... What's all this chit-chat? Okay, Mama. Listen, when are you coming? I'm really missing you. [in Hindi] Yes, dear! [in English] Papa's looking into the tickets. - Now, you tell me. - [Anaitha] Uh? Have you been taking your medicines? [upbeat piano music playing] [inaudible] Babe? Ali... I'm getting... [vehicle passing] - What happened to you? - [horn honks] Why are you so bugged? - [cell phone ringing] - [angrily] They're calling again! Take it! [Ishaan] Hello? Yeah, yeah, we're on the way. Um... probably another half an hour or so? Right. Cheers! Just relax okay, baby? You'll get there on time. Chill. [puffs] Can you overtake the guy, at least? - Just stop backseat driving! - I'm in the front seat! Passenger seat, front seat, whatever you wanna call it. Just stop doing that! This is so typical of you! You have to fight with me just before I'm leaving. I'm not fighting with you. That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you. You're the one who's screaming. You're the one who's yelling all the time! - Just stop yelling! - [whispers] I should've taken a cab! - Really? You wanna take a cab? - You know what? Just stop the car! Pull over to the left, put it in second gear and park it on the left. Fine! I know which gear to put it in. Stop teaching me how to drive! - [Ishaan] Stop here! Just-just stop! - [tires screeching] Open the boot! - [Alisa] It's freakin' open! - [growls angrily] [breathes shakily] [grunts] [thud] - [wheels rolling] - This is how you wanna do it, right? - You're the-- - This is how you want me to leave! You're the one who wants to leave. Take a cab if you wanna take a cab! [screams in frustration] [engine starts] [Alisa] Ishaan, just put down the phone and get into the car. - Open the boot! - It's open. [wheels rolling] - [Alisa] Welcome back. - [irritated voice] Just drive. [soft piano music playing] [horn honks] - [Alisa] One sec, one sec! I'm trying! - [all] Five! Four! - I'm trying, I'm trying to divide it. - [Rajiv] Done! [chuckles] - [woman] Awesome, Uncle! - [Rajiv in excitement] Yes! - [woman] Faster than a calculator! - [all cheering and laughing] - [cheering continues] - [Alisa sadly] Yeah... - [man] Check it, check it! Is it right? - [Rajiv chuckles] [feel-good music playing] [clickety-clack of keyboard] [whispers] Symptoms of... [call connecting] Hi, Uncle. Can I come see you tomorrow? [birds chirping] - [Dr. Dev] What's worrying you? - [sighs] Where do I even start? I mean obviously Ishaan doesn't understand it. Anaitha's not here, so she can't see what's going on. Mum, forget Mum, 'cause she's gonna panic if I tell her anything. But Uncle, you know Dad. I mean, Dad... you know his brain you know his mind, you know how it used to work and now, he's just so different! He's in and out of conversations! He's forgetting things, he's all over the place! I mean, he had to use a calculator for the first time. His zip was open the other day. He's sort of here there, everywhere-- Okay. Slow down, slow down. Okay? [sighs] Uncle, he's forgetting things. He forgot to bring my accounts the other day and-- - Hmm. - [breathes heavily] Is there something else that you want to tell me? Uncle, obviously you know that Grandpa had Alzheimer's, right? Hmm! I mean, Grandma's dad had it too. It is genetic. It runs in the family. Now, from everything that I've read and I've googled this extensively, hmm? He's clearly showing the symptoms. [sniffs and sighs] Dear, these things happen to a lot of people at this age. - Hmm. - There's nothing to worry about. It's possible that these things can lead to Alzheimer's or it could just be stress. Uncle, he has nothing to stress about. He's practically semi-retired. Precisely! Maybe, that's why he's stressed out? [whispers] Okay... [breathes heavily] I'm sorry. I... [sighs] Look, I know I'm all over the place. It's just that I'm panicking, Uncle. I... [exhales] I just need you to walk me through... [inhales] the possibilities, you know? Worst case scenario. If it were to happen... - is he going to forget us? - Ugh! Okay. Let's take things one step at a time. - Okay. - We want to help him. Yeah. So, let's focus on what you can do to help him. Okay. Look, dear! I know your dad. He's always liked the theater. - Let's revive that interest. - Hmm! As far as I remember, he used to be a passionate golfer. Yeah. Get him back to golf. Encourage him with more physical activities. Social interactions! Get him to meet more people. [Alisa] Mm-hmm! I understand your concern. I suggest, you bring him to the clinic one of these days. - We'll run a few cognitive tests on him. - Okay. Would that make you feel better? Yeah, I think so. Good. These things will definitely help him. - [sniffs] - Okay. And you, too. [chuckles] Just look at yourself. - What are you-- - [sighs] What are you doing to yourself? I can see that you've not been sleeping. [exhales] I... Lack of sleep? That's not a good sign. [sniffs] I know, I know. Really? [exhales] ♪ What do you know, What's on my mind? ♪ ♪ What do you know?

In fact, I've done my tests just last week... and my cholesterol has come down. Papa, this is not about your cholesterol. I'm genuinely concerned about you. - Pa, look at me. - [sighs] Tell me. What are you doing with your life? Every time I come here, you're-- I don't know what you're doing. You're on YouTube, you're watering the plants. Papa, if you don't have work to do, then just get out of this space, please? - [sighs] - Go for a walk, go to the gym. Exercise! It's been like six years since I've seen you play golf! Do theater, Pa. Do something constructive. Anything constructive. - [sighs] - Where are your friends, Pa? Do you even have any friends anymore?

But at your age, this is not where I wanna be. Ali, this is not where I want you to be either... - but believe me you're getting there. - [sighs] Look at you, dear! Look at your eyes! - Your dark circles! - [sighs] Ishaan was telling me... just the other day, that you haven't been sleeping at all. Really, and look at your life, it's so stressful. It's just work, work, work, work, 24-7! This is my age to work, Pa! [voice breaking] This is exactly what I said 35 years ago, dear. Please, please, don't make the same mistake that I did. Learn from my mistakes. Believe me, nothing changes. Just look at you! Forget it! I told you when I came here that this was not about me, Papa. This was about you! You're the one who has the issues, not me! [shouts] And if you cannot understand how genuinely scared I am and how concerned I am about you, then just forget it! You continue living your life like this! Watch your YouTube! Water your bloody plants! Sit with your six abs, or your six pack! Whatever you wanna call it! Whatever it is, I'm just not gonna bother with you anymore! Papa, that's it! You know what I'm gonna tell Dr. Dev also, not to bother with you anymore! Ali, listen to me! Ali!

Yeah, you don't have time for me. You don't have time for the gym. And where the hell have you been anyway all this time? [inhales] Okay, okay. I don't have time for this either. - Yeah! - Been busy at work, buddy. - Of course! - Come, come! - Where? - Get in the car. - Okay, but where are we going? - Hey, sit! Get in the car. Can you just tell me where we're going, please? [Rajiv] Those were the days, when friendship was about plucking mangoes from a neighbor's tree... and then, bickering about how to eat those bloody mangoes. When friends didn't need to be on the phone with each other constantly... and you didn't need a social... what do you call it? - A social wall? - [horn honks] Doors were always open. No RSVP's. When it was more polite to accept rather than to decline. - [tires screeching] - Easier to visit than to call. [birds chirping] - ♪ Goin' away... ♪ - [sighs] - ♪ We're goin' away... ♪ - Shall we?

Look at me. - Hmm... - Hey, make eye contact. Huh? - [whispers] Okay, I'm looking at you! - [sarcastic chuckle] Have you quit your job? - Is that why I picked you up - [chuckles] from home today? You know it's really good to know you know me so well. - So, what you're jobless now? - Yeah. Please, for my sake, stop flitting from random job... to random job and go back to dancing. You were born to dance. Okay. Fine. Hey, but I wanna know about you. - What? - What's happening with Dad? Seriously, Ali? You wanna go there right now? [scoffs] Hello! We're already there. [Neha] Okay, a can of worms. A big fat can of worms! So, open up the can, 'cause I wanna see what's in it. Tell me I wanna know what's happening, buddy. [Neha grunts] - Ali! - Tell me. Just look at this place! Such a beautiful day! Like, you really wanna spoil it? - [chuckles] Okay, fine. - Yeah! - But for you! - Hmm! - [chuckles] - Anyway, hey how's Papa doing? Actually, to tell you a secret, I've missed him more than I've missed you! - Wow! - Yeah. - Thanks a ton! - [laughs] - Anyway, to tell you a secret. - Hmm? Actually, that's one of the reasons why I messaged you today. Okay. [inhales deeply] [exhales sharply] So, nothing's confirmed, and I'm not sure but... I feel like he's heading towards Alzheimer's. - Seriously? - Hmm. Your dad? No. - [sad music playing] - [Alisa inhales deeply] [inaudible] I just... I really wanna fix him. Hmm. - [inhales deeply] Actually, you know what? - What? - I wanna show you something. - What's that? [Alisa] Patience, patience! Hmm! Can you believe... that this man has been writing a journal? Uh... and you stole it? [scoffs] I didn't steal it. I found it on his desk. Uh... then, I put it in my bag. [puffs] Which is stealing. - You know that, right? - [chuckles] But look at this! I mean… Aw, so cute! "One's success is everyone's success." [both giggle] - Oh, my God! Mary Juwana! - [breathes shakily] Like please, - she would've been like some - [chuckles] hot chutney Mary girl, ha, back in the day. [chuckles] Please, your dad wrote, "Do her." He could've been a little bit more tasteful and said, "Make love to her." Seriously? Do Mary? - Yuck! Yuck, yuck... - [screams in pain] - Okay, stop it! It hurts, man! - That's disgusting! That's my dad! - He wrote it. - Look at what he wrote, please! - Read it properly. - Here, "Do her." Oh, my God! He cannot pronounce it! Well apparently, he can't even spell it. - Yeah! - It's... it's "marijuana." - [laughs] - He wants to smoke a joint! Yeah! [chuckles] Listen, that is even more scandalous for any parent! Come on! - Please! No. - I'm really surprised that he still hasn't done it. I know. He should've learned from us, right? - Mary Juwana! - [chuckles] [Alisa chuckles] [Rajiv] Yes, those were the days... when you dreamt, but you didn't do... 'cause time just wasn't enough. [soft chuckle] But it never is. 'Cause I suffered from the if-this-then-that syndrome. Like, I guess everyone does. If I had the time, then I would... if I had the money, then I would... if I was younger, then I would. Oh, the list goes on and on and on. [vehicle passing] [Alisa] What are we doing with our lives? I don't know what we're doing with our lives, but I think it was really sweet the way your dad, um... wrote out all his unfulfilled desires. But you know what's funny is that actually, they're all such simple desires. - Just so simple! Such small simple things - Yeah. that anyone can do. Do you remember all of our small simple desires? - Oh, God! - Um... I'll tell you the easiest one is... - uh... - Let's not get started on that. - learning how to speak Spanish. - Spanish! - [Neha] Yeah. - Oh, my God! [chuckles] Learn Spanish? [Rajiv] It's like a stupid math equation. You know, one that I could've solved much more easily several years ago. If X is equal to, less than, greater than Y... then, blah blah blah! The truth is X and Y have nothing to do with each other. When X figures out the Y, W-H-Y... then, I guess there's time for everything. So, what are we gonna do about your dad? I think... I have a plan. Hmm? And you're gonna help me. - [Neha] Uh-huh! - Mm-hmm! [upbeat music playing] - [doorbell rings] - I can't believe you... - [woman mutters on TV] - see these TV serials! Bahadur! [muttering on TV continues] - No, I don't know. - Expecting someone? [doorbell rings] - Oh, my God! - Hi, Ma! This must be my lucky day! - The father and the daughter... [chuckles] - Hi! - Auntie! - both home! [chuckles again] - What about me? - Daughters, daughters, daughters! - Hi! - [Alisa] I love the look, Father. - How are you? - [Rajiv] So good to see you! [Alisa] Look... who's here! - Hi! - Neha... after so long! [kisses] - I know! - Where have you been? Here! Blame this madam. - Blame me for everything. - Of course. - Yeah. - And what's with all these suitcases? Ishaan's not in town, so I thought I'll surprise him, get the house painted. - Hmm. - He's always been wanting to do it. - I just wanted to come along. - Great! - Yeah! So, we're here for a while. - Yeah! - Nice! - [Rita] And you brought the whole store. It's not the whole store, Mama. Come on! Exaggeration. - You got an ice cream? - [Alisa puffs] Tough luck, Papa! Obviously not. Come on. - [Rajiv sighs] - [in Hindi] Come on! - Neha? - Hmm? [in English] What is all this rubbish? What are you doing? We're all gonna be eating healthy now, Uncle. So, brace yourself for some steamed vegetables. - And what do I owe this to? - Not what, "who." What? "Who," Uncle... and the "who" is you. You owe this to yourself! And what have I done, man? You're the one making tall claims about how fit as a fiddle you were at Ali's age, right? So, now obviously she's got to outdo you! - Ali said that? - [chopping veggies] Also, you know Ali, right? If she's on a diet, we're all on a diet. Why should I suffer? Huh! I'm not gonna eat all this. Forget it. By the way, Uncle! We've got a trainer coming in at 07:00 a.m. tomorrow. To get fit! To get fit! What rubbish, man! You all do what you want. What have I got to do with this? [birds chirping] [Alisa exhales sharply] [loud music playing] [both breath heavily] - [Alisa] Ah... [exhales sharply] - Hello! - [Alisa and Neha] Good morning! - What is all this? - What are you guys up to? - [Neha] Hi! - Such loud music! - [Neha] I told you! I told you yesterday that there was a trainer coming in at 7:00 a.m. Pa! [breathes heavily] Muneer. Muneer, my dad! - Hi! Hi, sir! - Hi, Rajiv. - [Muneer chuckles] Hi! - [Alisa exhales] - [Muneer] Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, sorry. Okay, you all carry on. - Yeah, yeah, walk away! - Hmm! This is only for the young and the fit people, anyway! - [music continues playing] - What's that? You heard what I said. Say it again! Young and fit, huh? - [Neha and Alisa] Uh-huh! - Oh! Prove us wrong. Join us. Let's get fit. You just wait! I'll be back. - Yeah, yeah. - I'll go change and come. - Yeah! Come back, come back. - [chuckles] Prove it, Pa. Prove it. Prove it! [Muneer] Alright, three more rounds! Come on, we can do it! - Up and one, two! - [both breathe heavily] One! Two! Three! - [Rajiv] Ah! - Alright, welcome! - Young and fit! - Yeah, mean machine! - Come on! - [Alisa] Come! Yes! I'm ready, I'm ready! ["Ek Pal" by Kenny, Jeet, Kanika and Kenishaa playing] Alright, Mandira. Okay. - Gosh! This woman drives me mad! - [soft chuckle] [Alisa] What are we packing? - [Neha] Fruit. Cabbage soup. Salad. - [song continues playing] [Alisa] Okay, great! - [in Hindi] What is this? - Sweets. No more sweets for Papa from today. - Bahadur! - Take this! - Give this to sir. - [in English] Thanks, Bahadur. - Cool! - [song continues playing] Hmm, I'm eating right now as we talk.

Happy Diwali! - Happy Diwali! - Happy Diwali! - [Neha] Happy Diwali, Auntie! [Rita] Wow, Usha! You look gorgeous! You've lost so much weight! Seven kgs. - [Alisa] Wow, Auntie! - [Rita] Seven kgs? How? - Let me explain. - Mm-hmm! You know my old body was never fat. - Hmm. - It was toxic. And that is what I had to understand. You see, Ali, you are not fat. You've just become toxic. There is poison in your body. - [Neha chuckles] - [Rita] Ignore them, ignore them, Usha. Tell us more. Chokkalingam's Detox Camp. You must go there, dear. It has changed my life. - Mm-hmm! - Just look at me now! Non-toxic! - Amazing! - [Rajiv] Usha... - [Neha chuckles] - have some sweets. No, no, thank you! That's toxic! [Alisa] It's toxic. - [Usha] So, Rita, set to leave? - Hmm? [Rita] Yes, yes! Very excited to see Anu! - [whispers] Chokkalingam? - Uh-huh! - Hmm? - [Rajiv] How's Deepak? Is he playing golf? [Usha] Yeah, yeah! He's started off regularly. What about you, Rajiv? [Rajiv] I've just restarted. [Usha] Good, good! Stick to it. Listen! I've looked it all up. People have lost five kgs and stuff in seven days! - [scoffs] - And if Usha aunty can do it, anybody can do it! Is there food? We are supposed to lose weight. Can you stop thinking about food? But you know what, Ali? I don't believe in all this detox and stuff, it's all a big scam! Scam or not, Pa! You're coming with us! - No. - Mama's anyway not in town, what are you gonna do here? So, you and Neha go. - I'm not coming. - No, no... if you're not coming with us, then we're not going! We all suffer together. Why should I have to suffer with you? Because... the family that suffers together, stays together. No, I'm not coming. - Ali! - Come! It's "The family that prays together that stays together!" So, Uncle, let's all suffer together! - Then, we'll all pray together! - Pray together! - Then, we'll stay together. - Stay together! - It'll be fun! Come. - Yeah, you're coming. - No, I'm not! - You're coming! - Come! - No I said! - Pa, please! You're coming. - I'm not coming. No. - Come! - You're coming. - I'm not coming. - Pa, you're coming! [fast-paced piano music playing] [Neha hums] Now, look at where we're going. What is the direction of the road now? I don't know, now the road is blue. Exactly! So, we're supposed to go in the direction of the blue road. - What is the opposite direction color? - Grey. Exactly! So, that is the opposite direction, okay? So, the right road is the blue road. But how do you know all that? Who teaches you all this? [chuckles] It's common sense, Pa. What common sense? How can you bloody understand these things without even a user manual? [Alisa chuckles] Nothing has a user's manual nowadays, Pa. Okay, you know what, Pa? Give it to me. I'll help you. Stop stressing so much, okay? I'm gonna put her on speaker phone, so she's gonna talk to us now. All you need to do is just relax and listen to where she's telling us to go. [recorded voice] In 500 meters, turn right! What? Half a kilometer? Half a kilometer? - So, turn right in half a kilometer! - Yeah, yeah! Relax! - Look at your odometer! - Chill, Pa! Chill! Chill! She'll tell us when to turn. You know what? You're stressed. You're too stressed. Give it to Neha, tell her to do it. [Rajiv] This lady and I don't get along at all! Neha, take this! [Alisa and Rajiv shout] Neha! Sorry! What? - [Alisa] Navigate! - [Neha] Okay, it's saying "Go straight." [Alisa] That even I know. [click-clack] - [cell phone beeps] - Hmm. So, who are you messaging? Nobody. [Alisa] Liar! - [Alisa] Tell me! Who? - Nobody! [Alisa] Okay! Say hello to your nobody from me! - [Neha] Wow! Orange County's so beautiful! - [Alisa] Yeah! - [Alisa] It is. - [Rajiv] God! This is so heavenly! - [Neha] Should we take the bags out now? - [Rajiv relaxes] - [Alisa] Yeah, yeah, take it out! - [Neha] Okay, hurry up fast! It's like raining. - [Alisa] Okay! - Uncle here, take it! Thanks, dear. [cheerful music playing] - Can you charge it here? - Pa, let me pay! But why? [in South Indian accent] Good morning! Myself Chokkalingam. I am the Master of this camp. [Alisa chuckles] Remember! This camp only for detox. - Yeah, really. - Where is the waiter? - [indistinct chatter] - Are you chewing gum? Yeah. You're not supposed to. Please, spit it out, like right now! - Like, that's not allowed! - I'm not eating it. Yeah, but you're chewing it. It sort of messes with your digestive system. That's the whole point of this program. [Chokkalingam] Rules... [clears throat] No smoking! - Drinking, no! - [Neha whispers] Oh, God! - They call this soup? - Eating, no! [coughs] What is this? Um... so good! [Chokkalingam] Morning, morning, yoga! Hmm? [Chokkalingam in Hindi] Nothing else will happen. [in English] Roll the hips left to right. Come on! Now, raise your hands to the air. [laughs] Evening meditation. In between... exercise, energy, relaxation. [feel-good music playing] Oh... aha! Very nice! [Rajiv snores] [grunts angrily] [snoring continues] - [gasps in shock] - Hmm? Neha! I'm hungry! Listen, I'm starving! [birds chirping] - This Chokkalingam is a joke! [scoffs] - I want food. I don't know where this Ali's brought us, ya! - I don't even think it's gonna work. - Psst! Psst! Who's that? Uncle, you want something? Show me what you have! I have lots! Here, take this! - [boy gasps] - It's chocolate! Wow! - Wow! Hey, come back! - Where's our change? Psst! Psst! - [boy gasps] - [Chokkalingam] Remember! No cheating the Chokkalingam! Hmm? Chokks not making jokes! [boy giggles] [birds chirping] Ne, you're in there? [Neha] Yeah! How long are you gonna take? [Neha] Give me ten minutes. You need to get that vibe... - that intoxication... - [Alisa chuckles] inside your body! [in Hindi] Intoxication! Um? [in English] How do you get this intoxication? - [whispers] What are we doing here? - [Chokkalingam] Very simple! - [Alisa whispers] I have no idea! - By dancing! - Why can't we just get out of here? - Um! You need to dance! - [Alisa] Hmm. - Understand? - Where do you wanna go? - Right? - Do you wanna do some real drugs? - So, we will now do detox... - Shut up! You have? - with dancing! - Of course! - Okay? Chokkalingam will show you how to dance! You must get your mind free of all the energy! - Five minutes! - [Chokkalingam] Please, rise up! Rise up, everybody! Rise up! Stand up! Chokks will show you the pokes! - Now! Slowly moving outside! - [whispers] Come on, come on! Let's go! - Moving! Moving! - [Neha and Alisa giggle] - [both breathe heavily] - [crickets chirping] - [shivers] So cold! - Yeah! [gasps] I can't believe we're doing this here! I know neither can I. Hurry, hurry! Someone's gonna come. - Do fast! - Ali, you do it then! I'm not a joint factory. You know I don't know how to do this, right? Yeah, yeah, I know. Because you just purposely never learnt! Hurry, dude! [Alisa] So... how come your dad hasn't responded to your calls? Or your 100 messages? Listen, who the hell knows? And Ali, stop going through my phone! I can't promise you that. And it wasn't a 100 messages, it was like barely ten! [Alisa] Hmm. Yeah, I know where you're coming from. But... [clears throat] he's been trying to call you for a year, dude. Like, why didn't you respond to him? - I know. - You just ignore him. I know. - But I was like really angry... - Hmm. - and frustrated. - Mm-hmm. It's not like I've forgiven him. - I've not forgiven him... - Hmm. for being the raging alcoholic that he was. [inhales deeply] And I've not forgiven him... for not being the dad... or the husband that he was supposed to be. [Alisa] Hmm. But... you know I was also thinking that some relationship - is better than no relationship? - Hmm. Yeah. - [sighs] - Of course. Okay, true. He sent me a message sometime back. Right. - And he said, "I'm fine, I'm sober." - Hmm. But you know... of late, he's not responded to any of my messages. So, for all I know, he's probably passed out drunk somewhere. Hmm. You're worried about him. Yeah, of course, I'm worried about him! Yeah! Nay, don't make me cry. [cries] No, it's just that you know... when I see you with like, your dad... like I also want that, right? [sobs] Who wouldn't want that with their dad? I miss it, you know. Yeah, I know everything he's done and all. At the end of the day, our life is so short! You know? - You don't wanna regret anything. - [sniffles] I think, some way you've got to like forgive him. - [sniffs] - Just let it go! It's okay. He is what he is, he was what he was. He's done what he's done. Now... move on. - [Rajiv] Ali? - It's like... [Rajiv] Neha? Pa? Pa! [Rajiv] Ali! I've been looking all over for you! That Chokku's... - [sniffs] He's driving me nuts, dude! - [Alisa chuckles] - So, you also snuck out? - Okay? What are you doing? - Nothing. - Nothing. [Alisa whispers] Hide it! What's that? - [Alisa] Please! - What? - I'll tell him? - [Alisa chuckles softly] Okay, fine. I got a Mary. - You wanna do her? - Juwana? - Marijuana, Pa! [chuckles] - [Neha chuckles] Where did you get this? - That boy-- - Shut up! - Tell you later. - Have you had it before? - Um... - Yeah! No! - Ali, have you had it before? - [Alisa mutters] - No! - Yeah! [Alisa chuckles] Ali, decide! Okay, whatever! Come on, give me also! - What? - Really? - No, Pa! - Let him have it! A family that suffers together must party together! - No! - Correct! It's okay, I wanna try it once. Once in my life, that's all! - Seriously? - You also shouldn't, huh! - Just once. - Yeah. - [Alisa chuckles] - Seriously? - Yeah! - [in Hindi] Sure? - [in English] Come on! You can have it. - Sure? Of course! Okay, fine. [upbeat guitar music playing] Come on, pull! [Rajiv inhales deeply] [coughs] [inaudible] [loud music playing] [Chokkalingam chuckles] What is this mad house? - It's crazy! Let's go? - [Rajiv chuckles] - What's going on? - Come! [in Tamil] Come, come, come! [in English] Go Papa! Go Papa! [in Punjabi] Hooray! Hooray! [Rajiv sings "Ye raatein, ye mausam" by Kishor Kumar] - [Alisa] Hi, Pa! Finally! - [Rajiv hums] [chuckles] What are you singing? - Oh, Ali! Come, come... come fast! - Where? - Where? - I have to take you somewhere! Okay, but where are we going, Pa? Hey! Come, Ali, this gorgeous spot I found! - Just come and look it's so... - [Alisa] Okay! Careful! [grunts] beautiful! [Alisa] Come. - So, Ali! - Hmm? - Say it! - Tell me, how's Ishaan doing? - Hmm? - [inhales deeply] I don't know. Must be fine. Now, what happened? I don't know, man. Papa, it's like so annoying. Like at the drop of a hat, we just fight. We've just been always fighting for no rhyme or reason. For some reason, he... seems to think that he's not a priority in my life. Mm-hmm! You know what? - [whispers] What are you-- - It's okay, it's just rain water. Maybe he's right, darling! You both have stressful jobs. And I mean, you hardly have time for each other. You... you haven't spoken to him since he left? Um... on and off. I sent him a selfie we took last night and he hasn't even responded, so I haven't bothered to call him today. Very nice! So, here the man thinks he's not a priority in your life... and you haven't even-- And you've barely spoken to him since he left. Huh! Pa, you're the one who said, "Boys need their space." Boys need their space... and men need their wives. You're married now, Ali! He's your husband. Come on! Let him feel important. Hmm, so, what are you saying? Ali, what I'm saying is... just make him believe... that he's a priority in your life. I mean, give him that importance. Alright? Come on, let's go! I want to show you something. - Come, come! - [chuckles] Where are you taking me, Pa? This beautiful place I found. - Uncle! - Hmm? I'm starving. And I don't know how Ali's doing this, ha, without cheating. Don't even tell her that we're cheating. My God! She'll throw a fit, man! [Alisa] Sorry. [sighs] - Is everything okay, dear? Who's that? - Don't ask. Who do you think? Just got out of an abusive relationship. - [Alisa] Huh! - Oh, Mandira! - [Neha chuckles] - [chuckles] Yeah! How did you guess? Such a reputation this woman has, ha! [birds chirping] - [Alisa sighs] - [Rajiv] You can't fix it? Please... I don't think I want to. Not after that conversation! She always throws a hissy fit... when I'm not at her beck and call. [Neha] Hmm... [Rajiv sighs] [Alisa sighs] Anyway, Pa... Hmm? Listen! I just wanted say thank you. Hmm? For what? [inhales deeply] Just... thank you. What's all this sudden gratitude for? Is all this yesterday's intoxication or what? [Alisa puffs] - Uncle! - From the Mary? For once, she's tryin' to say thank you. I think, you should just listen. Yeah, Pa. You know, I mean... I don't know. Sometimes, I think about it, you've spent your whole life... so focused and so stressed about giving the best to Anu and me that... uh, I-- Sometimes, I just wish that you could turn back time. Rewind it. Live your own life. - Of course! Of course, I've... - [soft music playing] I have lived my life. - I've done everything that I wanted to. - [Alisa sighs] Which parent doesn't say that, huh? [cries] Your grandmother always used to tell me. [inhales] There are three things in life that don't come together... money, health and time. - You know, when at your age... - [Alisa] Hmm? you have time, you have health, - but you just don't have the money. - [Alisa] Hmm. And then, when you get into your 40's, you have... you have some money... and you have the health, - but you just don't have the time. - Time! [inhales] And then, look at me, dear! I have everything. [Alisa chuckles softly] I just don't have my health anymore. - So... - [Alisa exhales] make the best of what you have now. So, now you realize that your health is important? - Rubbish! - [Neha chuckles] I always knew my health was important. It's just that I... I didn't have the time. - Uncle... - [Alisa sniffs] I also just wanted to say thank you. - [Rajiv] Aw... - [Alisa chuckles] You know, for always being there for me. [Rajiv kisses] - Look at that! - [Alisa] Hmm. It's lovely! There is something on the banks, right? Look, look! Its head is moving up and down. I don't know. It's beautiful! It's just spectacular! I'm so happy to be here, dear. - [Rajiv] Hmm? - Not you! - What's all this, dear? - Nothing. Come on! Tell me. Saw? Good. - Hmm. - Good. [Alisa sniffs] You know what? I also wanted to thank both of you. - [Neha] For what? - [Alisa] Why? For snooping around in my office and finding my journal. - What journal? - What journal? - [Alisa chuckles] - I don't know what you're talking about. [Rajiv chuckles] Okay. This is it! This is... - Okay, bye. - Let me know how it goes. Yeah. [Alisa] Tell him everything, okay? Okay. - Bye, Uncle. - Bye, dear. God bless you. - Look after your dad, okay? - [whispers] Yeah! Look after Ali. - [Rajiv] Message when you reach! - Yes! [Rajiv and Alisa] Miss you. - Bye, will miss you too. - [Alisa] Bye! [birds chirping] [call connecting] [exhales] [rings doorbell] [horn honks] [knocks on door] [Neha] Dad? Neha? Hi, Uncle! - Hi, Neha. - How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I'm actually looking for Dad... and everything seems to be locked. Do you know where he is? Dear, we couldn't find Dad's phone. - Okay. - I only had your number... and I kept trying to call you, but your phone was coming unreachable. Yeah, that's because I changed my number two months back... 'cause I didn't want him to have it. But where is he now? Hi, sorry! Did you see my dad? Uh, is he at yoga? [suspenseful music playing] Did you see him at breakfast by any chance? Hi, Vibhinna! Have you seen my dad? Was he in Yoga? [sighs] Dear, he was in a pretty bad condition. - Okay. - His liver was... - was failing. - Okay? And dear... he passed away few days back. No, no, he wasn't at yoga and... Johnny's saying he's not at breakfast. I don't know where he is. Hi, Teju. Hi, Akhi. No, I just wanted to check. Have you seen my dad? [silently sobs] [inaudible] Papa! [cries] - Where have you been? - Ali... thank God, you found me! Where have you been, Pa? The whole search party-- Sit down! The whole search party is going is going crazy looking for you. I was gonna call Mama and Anu and tell them that I can't find you! Where were you? [inhales] I'm running helter skelter from the other time looking all over for you! - Where did you go? - Ali! What happened? Thank God, thank God, you-- Did you... did you get lost? - [breathes shakily] - [shaky voice] Yeah... I mean, everything is the same! It's all like... like... forest and and everything... - [sobs] and that gate was locked! - [sniffs] I don't know... I looked everywhere! So, Papa, call me! - I-- - Take your phone the next time! I'm panicking. I'm so scared! [sobs] This is the same thing that happened to Grandpa and I... I don't know what to do 'cause [stammers] I was so small. - I don't know how to control it. - [cries] It's alright. I'm okay. [sniffs] Were you scared? - [Rajiv sniffs] - [breathes heavily] [in Hindi] Dear... [in English] Papa, please! Just go... go back and see Dr. Dev. Please! I-I know, I don't know what is happening to you, but I really feel... [sniffs] I'm scared! [stammers] I don't know, Pa. If you're getting Alzheimer's, then maybe there's something we should do, right? Maybe, he'll be able to help. [breathes shakily] Ali, just... - relax. - [sniffs] Relax, dear! I don't know what I'm getting. I don't know what is happening myself, dear. But I'll see Dada. I mean, I'll see Dr. Dev. You have to-- You have to take care of yourself. You have to fix yourself. - Ali, stop obsessing. - There's something that's happening to you Papa. You're forgetting things. [stammers] You're a little delusional, you're a little spaced out here and there. You're still very smart, but you're not as sharp as you used to be. Ali, listen to me. Listen! Whatever's gonna happen, we'll deal with it. But what's important is that we... we spend this time together. - We enjoy ourselves. - Yeah. - I know that. That's why, we're here. - And we love each other! [sniffs] Yeah, Pa, but... [Alisa sniffs] - [sighs] - [stammers] I, you know I just, I wanted to spend this time with you because I'm scared and I don't know when it's gonna happen and you know if it happens, then I don't know what we're gonna do if something happens to you, Pa! If you forget us, if you forget me... - Ali! - [sniffs] then... what, what are we gonna do? [stammers] But I just wanted to say that I love you, and I'm sorry for everything that I've done to hurt you, and if something happens I'll be there. If your zip is open, I'll zip it up for you. If you forget somebody's name, I'll-- I'll remind you of their name. I'll hold your hand, Pa. I won't let you get lost again. [sniffs] I won't let you get lost again. I'm sorry. [cries] Ali, stop it, Ali. [Alisa sobs] [low voice] I love you, dear. I think you should, you know do all the things that you've always wanted to be doing. - Yes! - The things that make you happy! Just live your life for yourself! Just have fun! Just enjoy life! Just... you know... don't worry about us. We're fine. We're okay. I'm fine. I'm sleeping. I'll sleep. You just have fun, [breathes shakily] you know! - Thank you! - Just be happy, Pa. [Alisa breathes shakily] See, dear! - See, dear, while we're here... - Hmm. - as long as things are fine... - [sniffs] Hmm! - just let's enjoy these moments. - Hmm. We're sharing this wonderful time with each other, dear. [both cry silently] - Let's just make the most of it. - Hmm. - [whispers] That's a good idea! - And we'll figure, dear. I know, because you're there. I'm not scared. - I'm not scared. - [breathes shakily] You know what? - You must be hungry. - [chuckles] [chuckles] Let's share this as well. Where did you get that from? - My friend. - [chuckles] - A little cheating is okay. - [mimics] I'm not cheating Chokkalingam. [chuckles] Come on! I'll deal with Chokkalingam. Now, come on, eat! - [sniffs] - Have it! [both chuckle] ["Ek pal" by Joel Jacob playing] ♪ Don't give up ♪ ♪ In the game of life ♪ Hi, Ma! Hi, Rita! - What's up? - [Rita] Hi, dear!

Yeah, so, Ali... Alisa came to see you or what? Did you give her some medication to help her get sleep? Actually, she's more concerned about you, Rajiv. [chuckles] There's nothing wrong with me. [scoffs] What did she say about herself? [chuckles] Like father, like daughter! Look, she's really stressed out. I think, she needs to relax. Um! Yeah, Dev, but you know Ali! She doesn't even have time to breathe. Because she's spending so much time worrying about you. I think, let her believe that... she's trying to help you. Maybe, that will be good for her too. [Rajiv] They say you should wear your own oxygen mask before helping someone else. But sometimes... the only way you can help yourself... is by helping someone else. [chuckles] [soft piano music playing] [Alisa] So, please! Dear Dad! Take care of yourself for me! I'm more fragile than I show... and more dependent than you see. I promise, in return, that I will walk by your side. And as you age, your fears and worries, in me you can confide. And should you want to do what needs you to be stronger than you are... I'll be your strength, I'll hold your hand, and I'll never be too far. Time is swiftly fleeting and I'm not sure how long... I will have you close to me, to show me right from wrong. So, I'll seize the moment and I'll proudly tell you today... that I love you and need you, Papa every step of the way. [soft music playing]
