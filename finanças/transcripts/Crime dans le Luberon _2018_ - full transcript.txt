MURDER IN THE LUBERON Come on, search for it. I got it. - 4 hours flew by. - What was the subject? Is child the father of man? - The father of man. - The father? - Jeez! Some subject. - Sure. And how did you fare? Good. Did you reread it? Not fully. I didn't really have time. Go on then! Idiot! That guy's crazy! You're the idiot! - You there? - Insane! - Mum! - It's OK. It's... a stupid biker overtook me like a madman. - OK. - How rude! - Mum, I have to go. - OK, darling. - Talk to you this evening. - OK. - Love you. - Love you too. Kisses. That's the deputy prosecutor. Elisabeth Richard, deputy prosecutor. Hello, madam. Chief warrant officer, Caroline Martinez. Madam. At ease, I'm not from the army. It's rare to meet VIP prosecutors. I'm far from a VIP. I'm just an ordinary judge. What about the victim? - Where did it happen? - This way. Pascal Achard, aged 45. A helicopter pilot in Avignon. He used to take tourists around. Fontaine de Vaucluse, Gordes, Sénanque Abbey. - Thank you, sir. - Madam. - The abbey's beautiful. - And its lavender fields. You love your region, you could be a tourist guide. No time for that. We're snowed under at the gendarmerie. There we are. Are you sure it's not a stupid hunting accident? Achard didn't look like a wild boar. And he was shot almost at point blank. - Any idea of the motive? - No idea. A few squabbles between hunters and anti-hunters. They were at loggerheads, but bumping someone off... Tell me something: you always talk like that? I'm direct. Even blunt, you might say. It'll be a pleasure investigating with you. I'm here for the regular statements. You'll be investigating with Captain Jouanic. By the way, there he is. That's the captain? - OK, chief warrant officer? - Captain. Deputy prosecutor, Elisabeth Richard. That's right. Captain Jouanic. Delighted. Not me. You almost knocked me off the road. - You were in that little car? - I was. OK, alright. Look, I'm sorry. Speed sometimes gets the better of me. Then how come I arrived first? I inspected the surroundings, just in case. A murderer's wandering in the wild. Any suspects in mind, Captain? It's too early to say. You know the area better than me. Heard anything special? No, nothing. But, 20 years ago, the Issautiers bought a vineyard from Pascal Achard's father, which resulted in some... animosity between the two families. - Issautier? - Prominent citizens here. In the region, actually. Paul and his son, Louis, took part in the hunt. Perfect. It's nice to share interesting information. Chief warrant officer, summon all the hunters who took part in the hunt starting with the... - Issautiers. - The Issautiers. Right, deputy prosecutor. - Madam will do. - Right, madam. Ah! Shit! Let us see whether the rose which this morning had opened Its purple dress in the sun Has retained this evening Kiss me, Ronsard. Show me. Been to the gendarmerie? No, not yet. And do you know who could have killed Achard? - There weren't many of you. - There were lots of people. Maybe it was you... after what happened. That's enough. - You're annoying. - You're right. Let bygones be bygones. - A kiss for the way? - No. You don't deserve it. See you. He's in the back. The colleagues are here. Pascal Achard doesn't have a password. That's good, very practical. What good is raising awareness on data protection? It suits us fine. Look at all these emails. Hot, huh! "My love, you are a purple flower, "brimming with honey and scent... "You are a soft sea hydra that opens at night." We got it. OK, OK, we got it. I don't know how I'd react if I received that. Apparently, the addressee likes it. I think I would. That man had a way of talking to women. "I like your words, your scent. Let's meet soon." my penis I know how to read, warrant officer. - You know him? - By name. A real seducer, a rolling stone, sometimes a pianist, sometimes a ski instructor. He wrote books, guides on the region. The kind of guy you could fall for. Nothing here? - Nothing, Captain. - Yes. Isabelle, Laure, Françoise, etc. If they were married, that's a lot of cuckolds, potential suspects. Identify all these ladies, Captain, and if they're married to hunters. Never know. OK, fine. Just a small detail. You're in charge of the investigation. But I'm not your assistant. We collaborate for a proper outcome? Of course. That's fine, thanks. Mr Louis Issautier. You killed the wild boar? Yes, absolutely. So... you were there. Yes, Caro. I was. Chief warrant officer, please. This is an interrogation, not a friendly meeting. Right, madam. - So, you were there. - Yes, I was, madam. Did you notice, see or hear anything unusual? I heard shots. When the animal appeared, everyone was shooting. I can imagine. The four-legged animal appeared and everyone shot. - But it must be a flat trajectory. - "Flat"? A shot towards the ground to avoid ricochets. You knew Pascal Achard was a womaniser? That's something everyone knew, in fact. And did you know any of his local conquests? No, I didn't. We weren't that close. I had no idea of his dance card. That's all for now. Thank you. Right. Hi, guys. You OK? Yes, fine. And you? This is a pain! What's their problem? Remember someone was killed. I don't care about Achard, we weren't pals. What are we waiting for? For the prosecutor to be done with Issautier. Really? - Got the rifles back? - The gendarmes have kept them. Well! We'll never get them back, believe me. All 4 of you were there. That's where you were. Absolutely, yes. About a dozen metres from Pascal Achard. - More or less. - Tell me, Mr Paul Issautier, did the Achards have any problems with you? What do you mean? They did, Mr Issautier. Problems about vineyard plots. Everyone knows about it here. Sure! That was twenty-odd years ago. My father was in charge back then. Pascal's father was having trouble. My father bought a plot, but he was a hard negotiator. Achard senior felt humiliated. And you go hunting with Achard junior? It's all water under the bridge now. We never brought up the topic. When we invite someone... A walk in the forest bearing rifles, with people whom we have issues with could be quite dangerous. But I'm telling you it's an old story. We never had anything against the Achards. Doesn't mean they don't hold a grudge. You know how it works. Land conflicts between southern families could be lively. But there weren't any conflicts. OK. Anyway, we'll check that out. Please remain available for the justice and the gendarmes. Thank you. I don't think Mr Issautier will leave. He'll receive the medal of commander of the Order of Agricultural Merit. On the 22nd actually. Awarded by the Minister of Agriculture himself. - Congratulations. - I didn't do anything. I'll receive the medal but it's a reward for the whole family. You are too modest. Thank you, sir. - Bye, madam. - Bye. - Bye, Caroline. - Sir. "Sir"... Think I have nothing else to do? I'm working. I'm not flogging a dead horse. That's enough! I'm not flogging one either, so stop shouting. - Mister? - Agnel. - Frédéric Agnel. - Mr Agnel. Go into that office. I'll be with you in a minute. Come on, take a seat. And calm down. It's OK, I am calm. Quite a rough guy. A fighter. One stare can knock you out. I won't turn my back on him. What do you think about the hearings? It's still a bit early. By the way, as regards the interrogations, Captain Jouanic's exempted? - The Captain had to leave. - Really? Please tell him that the next time he has to leave, he must at least inform me. OK. We've received the ballistic report. Pascal Achard was shot with a 300 Win. Heavy stuff! Designed for big game. It'll kill anything in a jiffy. - Coffee? - No, thanks. What's that 300 thingy? The calibre? For a rifle, usually a CZ 557. Not one of the weapons we seized. Right. First, we have to find that weapon. So, we'll have to get a search team ready and mobilise an army. And Achard's emails? I'm working on them. I find these things so exciting. How long do I have to wait? That's enough! I'm coming, Mr Agnel. - About time. - Good luck. Don't forget. When the captain decides to show up, I want to see him. - Right, madam. - So, Mr Agnel... You first. Thank you, sir. - Hello. - Hello. Welcome. Elisabeth Richard, I've booked. Mrs Richard... Yes, the cherry room. Very pretty! - Here. - Thanks. - Shall I call a porter? - Yes, please. Thanks. - Mrs Richard. - Yes. Someone's here for you. - Across from the terrace. - Ah, OK. Thanks. Well, well! The phantom. Glad to see you're still alive. - Have a drink? - The same as you. - A 2nd whisky, please. - Oh no! The same colour but no alcohol. Caroline said you wanted to see me. You missed the interrogations. No, but chief warrant officer Martinez was with you. I had no need to be there for the preliminary interrogations. Don't you like prosecutors or is it working with a lady that upsets you? I've had some mixed experiences, so I'm wary. Well, that is very honest. But being too wary mustn't prevent us working together. Don't worry, I'm professional, reliable, all's well. I know. Made enquiries? I like to know who I'm dealing with. I know you're not on good terms with Michel Garnier. He took me off an investigation. Too close to the victims? Each to his version. Closeness is not his thing. I also made enquiries. You know your nickname? The Pit Bull. Enough? Yes. - Here, sir, it's on me. - Thanks. You're welcome. What about the first interrogations? Nobody's heard or seen anything. It's not a hunter's weapon. - Nobody uses a 300... - A 300 Win. I know that. It's not an ordinary hunter's rifle. Besides the old quarrel between the Achards and Issautiers, nothing, unless you've got something else. Perhaps. I need to see a witness. Coming? Can you turn down that racket? - What? - Can you turn down that racket? It's not a racket. It's good music. We don't have the same tastes. - What's yours? - Classical. Could be compatible. Silence is nice too. - Your bike's for special occasions? - Depends on my mood. Usually, you work with Captain Gensac. Commander Gensac. He's on another case. Is Jouanic a Breton name? - It's Corsican. - Is it? No, my grandfather was from Lorient. One summer, he came to Cavaillon when he was 18 to pick melons. He met my grandmother, first kiss, love at first sight, and he never left. - And you? - What about me? Well, first kiss, married, love at first sight? Does that matter? No. I was trying to get to know you. But anyway... You're right, we don't have to. Where are we going? In Achard's emails Caroline identified 2 hunters' wives: Françoise Issautier, Paul's wife. That's interesting. And Lucie Agnel, Frédéric Agnel's wife. The one who flogs dead horses. He's got a chip on his shoulder. He's a bit edgy. - Hi, Ludo. - Charles. You OK? - OK? - Yes. Deputy prosecutor Elisabeth Richard. - Delighted. - So am I. - How about a coffee? - With pleasure. It's chilly. - Same for me. - You too? 200 euros! - Damn, I won 200 euros, Ludo. - Wow! Bravo, Jeannot. - Your round? - Coffee for this lady and gent. - Thanks, sir. - Pleasure. That's nice. Did you see anything? Right in front of me, Your Honour. Deputy prosecutor. - Same thing. - Not really. I confirm. You were saying? It was 3 weeks ago. Achard was having coffee while reading the papers when Frédéric Agnel turned up. What a catastrophe. Hi, Ludo. Agnel. A coffee, please. Hey, Achard. No outing, today? The cuckoo's resting? Sorry? Don't know what I mean? The bird that squats other's nests. - Agnel... - Bastard! Hey! Stop it! Shit! Agnel, let go of him! Come on... Stop it! Grab him! Grab him! - Stop it! - Agnel! You bastard! A real tiger. He was enraged. - An animal, that guy. - Yes. We know the creature. Shall we go talk to him? Bye, Ludo. Come on, sheep... Hey, come here! Come on! Deputy prosecutor. Captain. - It's about Achard? - That's right. Didn't we speak this morning? You just forgot to mention you had a little quarrel. A little quarrel, yes. Quite a fight, yeah! Between "quite a fight" and a shot, it's a fine line. I didn't go over that line. I smashed in his face, that was enough. Why did you? You should know. There's something you must know, Agnel. When a man discovers his wife's cheated on him, he's stunned, disappointed, enraged, or all three. Sometimes, beating up a rival isn't enough. A bullet may be the only solution for a jealous and irascible man. I'm not irascible. Stop it. Leave me alone. I've nothing to do with this affair. Let's say it's give and take. Tell the truth and we'll leave you alone. If not, we can take you into custody to clear your mind. Custody? Are you insane or what? What about my farm? Who'll see to it? The Holy Spirit? Listen, the animals can't wait. They need us, morning, noon and night. Forget about custody. But you must know you're the main suspect. You're completely mistaken. You really are. Ouch! Come on! Come on! I don't get it. He's a perfect suspect, you barely questioned him. Why isn't he in custody? I didn't think it necessary. He's a farmer, his life's here, he won't fly away. He's under pressure, so, if he's guilty, he'll move, believe me. It's smarter to leave him free and watch him discreetly. That requires people we don't have. I don't mean a 24/7 surveillance just something discreet. We've got a choice of suspects given Achard's lovelife. You seem in a mighty hurry to find the culprit. We don't want to do a botched job, right? Unless you have other fish to fry? So, let's go back to the Issautiers, please. I'm very sensitive to "pleases", but I'm not your chauffeur. Want me to walk there? I'm taking you back to your car. OK. Yes, hello. I've come unannounced but I've more questions for you. Have you got 5 minutes? Of course. Come in. It's lovely! A family house, I suppose. Yes, for 3 generations. A drink? Nothing, thank you. You're here? This is Faustine, my daughter. - Hello. - Hi. Please stand up to say hello. - Hello, miss. - Hello. May we have a word in private? I'm in the way. OK, I'm off. Nice! - What a temperament! - Yes. Sometimes too pronounced I'd say. It's her age. Your place is really beautiful. Thanks to my wife. She has a lot of taste. Please tell me about your relationship with the Achards. Actually, you knew Pascal Achard very well. Quite well, yes. You wife knew him too. You're asking if Françoise was his mistress? I'd have been more subtle, but yes. She was, indeed. But it doesn't seem to affect you. It's a kind... of gentlemen's agreement, of modus vivendi with my wife. Is your wife here? She is. Can I meet her? She's in her studio. Follow me. Come in. Françoise. Sorry to bother you. Come in. This is the deputy prosecutor, Mrs Richard. To talk to you. - Hello. - Hello. Right, I'll leave you. It's beautiful! You made it? It's my job. I'm a designer. It's awesome. It must be sexy on. Thank you. You're not here for my spring-summer collection. I'd like you to tell me about your affair with Pascal Achard. So you know. Pascal was charming, enticing. I shared things with him that I no longer share with my husband. And your husband knew. Did you know that? Yes, absolutely. We don't have secrets. We've been married 25 years, he's my children's father, and we love each other. Did you notice any change in Achard's behaviour? No. Actually, I did. He spent a lot of money but usually, he didn't have any. A lot of money? He even planned a long journey to the Andes cordillera. Really! But he was banned from the banks. He had no cheque book or credit card. Yes, he always paid cash. Cash. We didn't find any cash at his place. You know, Pascal was a wary and discreet man. OK. OK, Captain? Have you calmed down? - I'm very calm. - I saw that. How was your visit to the Issautiers? Surprising. A free couple. I'm not sure it's the right word. Rather philosophical. It's philosophical to accept your wife has a lover? Take Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Each to their life. - We don't have the same references. - What are yours? When you're a couple, you see that the other doesn't fool around. - They belong to you? - No. For the sake of love, precious things can't be shared. Romantic or old-fashioned? Choose. I don't care. - A touchy subject? - Not at all. So, you don't think Issautier killed Achard. Not because his wife was unfaithful. Why are we at Pascal Achard's again? - I'm looking for something. - Let's go. If you wanted to hide money at home, where would you put it? A question I never needed to ask myself. Just like you, I guess. Somewhere unlikely. Somewhere unlikely. Somewhere unlikely. Can you help me, Captain? Push the piano. That's a stash, right? Bingo! Oh, Jeez! 50, 100 and 200 notes. Not so broke after all! Nice lump sum! About 50,000 euros. Well done! I'm impressed, deputy prosecutor. What does cash make us think of? The Andes cordillera. The Andes cordillera? Françoise Issautier told me he always paid by cash and he was planning a journey to the Andes cordillera. We can't track the notes. They're old and the numbers aren't consecutive. Has he any family? A nephew, Daniel. He's got a vineyard nearby. Off we go. Daniel. - Hi. - You OK? - Deputy prosecutor Richard. - Hello. You've come about my uncle. From what I heard, he was a womaniser. Do you confirm that? He had a weak spot for women. To the extent of getting shot at point blank? No idea. He had a lot of affairs. But who could have taken revenge? Did you know he had more than 50,000 euros at his place? 50,000 euros cash? He never told you? You know nothing? We weren't that close, actually. We met from time to time, that's all. He wasn't very rich. Although he earned well. Well. 50,000 euros? Cash? That's a mystery. - An inheritance? - No, I'd have known. His father, Francis, died 3 months ago, but he was penniless. Issautier bought a plot of vines from Francis, right? "Bought "... At that rate, it was almost robbery. Things are still tense. You're mad at them? They're no friends of mine, those rascals. I'd have double the land and I'd earn a better living. Do you live alone here? A penniless farmer who works 15 hours a day is not very attractive. Goodbye to you. Nice car, for a small winegrower scraping a living. Make some enquiries. It's not an order. It's for the sake of the investigation. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION CHILD CARE SERVICES - Am I disturbing you? - No, I'm working. - On what? - Nothing. I'm hungry. Shall we get something to eat? As regards where the money came from, any news? Nothing. I'm really annoyed. How can someone have 50,000 euros in cash at home? Maybe a holdup. Stupid idea. Can you imagine Pascal Achard robbing a bank? I never imagined him writing erotic poems to all those women. Maybe he won it gambling. Or blackmailing. Maybe he was blackmailing someone? If so, when we click on, we'll be close to the exit. What's that? The Tambourin boy of Arcole. It's the pride of the village. Never heard of the battle of the bridge of Arcole? No. There'll be majorettes... - Majorettes? They still exist? - Majorettes, a brass band... If you want local entertainment, it's worth it. - Coming? - Is that what we hear? Exactly. Want to make organic wine? Yes, but my father doesn't agree. As he'll soon get the Agricultural Merit medal, he has no time to spare. He runs the estate brilliantly, but he's a bit conservative. Stand up to him, Louis. Innovate, right? Do as I did when I was young. Remember that, tomorrow, you'll be the boss here. Ludovic. - See that? - Yes. Ludovic. Lucien. Nice to see you. How are you? It's been a while. - Still in the brass band? - Sure, I am. Hello, Lucien. Charles. You alright? Come back to live at your mum's? Yes, temporarily. Granddad, please meet deputy prosecutor, Mrs Richard. - Delighted, madam. - Hello, sir. I believe you interrogated my son and grandson about Pascal Achard's murder. - Yes. They're in the clear, obviously. For the moment. Good. I wish you all the best. Goodbye, madam. Goodbye, sir. So that's Lucien Issautier, the patriarch. Yes. He makes really good wine. I guess he lives nearby? In the heart of Cadenet. The one in the vineyard is his son's. They're loaded. Wine makes money. So, you live at your mum's. I do. No point making a mountain out of it. Charles here, Charles there. - Everyone knows you. - The curse of small towns. We can't stay invisible. You know everything and everyone, so where shall we eat? I'd like a change from yesterday's TV dinner. Want to eat something exceptional? - I do. - There's only one place to go. I've eaten too much. - Some more? - No, thanks. Really. I had a second serving. It's a lot. - You're done! - I am. - I'll bring you some gravy. - Thanks, Marinette. Well? The best pieds paquets I've ever had. I've not eaten them often, but it was really tasty. Traditions are dying out. I understand why you've come back to Mum's. It's just for a while, until I find a house. You can stay as long as you want. He's fine here. We turned the old shed into a bedsit. With a private entrance and all! He says I annoy him, but he's happy to have a hot meal. That's enough, Mum. It's a big place. I'm all alone. His father died 20 years ago. He was much older. I liked mature men. You came back to live here, because...? Because... the usual: a break-up. Right. Thank you so much. I'd better go. Thanks. That was excellent. Thanks for inviting me, Charles. - Bye, madam. - See you soon. See you tomorrow, I think. On time and in a good mood, deputy prosecutor. - In a good mood, mostly. - Correct. - Bye. - Bye. She's lovely. Yes, but I don't care. I do care. She's lovely, but it's not my problem. - Don't you like her? - I met her 3 days ago. - Oh, you! - She's lovely, Mum. I can't say a thing. It's nice to see nature at rest, isn't it? There'll soon be buds, leaves, clusters... Grape harvesting, then wine, Louis. Yes, wine. You're strange. What's wrong? Nothing. Tell me, did you see anything at the hunt? Besides the wild boar I shot, no. Nothing. They checked the rifles. It wasn't a hunter. Achard had a lot of enemies. Dad, you should've never allowed her to see that guy. It's none of your business. It's more complicated. Don't tell me it didn't affect you? I didn't say that. Now, Achard's no more. He can burn in hell, no one will cry. - Hello, Caroline. - Hello, Francis. - Hello, warrant officer. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, madam. - Slept well? - No, I ate too much last night. - You dined with Charles. - News travels fast. My intentions were honourable. It was at Mum's. I wasn't worried. You're attracted to that bachelor captain of yours. Don't worry, I won't say a word, Caroline. I think he's really nice. He's pretty cute, eh? What about the investigation? Know where I can find Elodie Pasquier? - Yes. - I need her address. I'm off. Right away. Hello. How can I help you? Hello, gentlemen. Hello. Is Elodie Pasquier here? - She's in the yard. - Thank you. Hello. Elisabeth Richard, deputy prosecutor. - Louis told me about you. - Good things, I hope. Yes. It's amazing all that can be made with wicker. We can make almost anything. - Even sculptures. - I didn't know. Do you remember this? It's a copy of your statement for sexual harassment against Pascal Achard. Apparently, this man, who's just been murdered, didn't behave properly with women. Sadly, he behaved in a manner that is punishable by law. It was a long time ago. He offered to take me for a helicopter ride. When we landed, we went for a stroll and... and... he suggested... we have a drink at his place. The guy danced like that. You don't know to dance. 50 guys dancing in front of you like that. Come on, another one. - No, I'd better go. - Come on! You're pissed. You can sleep here. Wait, stop it. No, stop it. Let me. No one will know a thing. No! Stop it, you're hurting me! Stop it! What happened afterwards? I was running on the road. I was crying and... I came across the gendarmes who convinced me to file a complaint. Louis knows all this? Of course, he does. But... It was long ago. It doesn't matter. It does. Sexual harassment is something serious, miss. He just wanted to kiss me. That's the exact meaning of sexual harassment: attempting without the other's consent. Think so? I'm sure. After your statement, were there any reprisals, anything? We did our best to avoid each other, that's all. And Louis accepted to take part in a hunt with Pascal Achard? Wait on, what do you mean by that? Nothing. I'm thinking aloud. Thank you, Miss Pasquier. - Following me? - Caroline said you'd be here. - We work together, right? - Of course. I've nothing to hide. - Meet you at the station? - Wait on. Oh, great! You're insane! You drive like a madman! You were scared? No. I'm not suicidal, that's all. Where are you going? To question one of Achard's mistresses. She's the last on the list. Let go of me! Why am I handcuffed? Take off the handcuffs. I didn't do anything. - Move on. - Where to? Mr Agnel, why are you here? A fight, in a café, with another client. He was asking for it. You were ready to answer! I only hit. I didn't kill anybody. Beware. A blow can kill. - Did the victim file a complaint? - Which victim? There's no victim! He was annoying me. You serious? Of course, he did, one tooth missing and a black eye. You could be wrong. A crown, with a good lawyer, could cost him a lot. And Elodie? I just set the bait to see how the fish would react. The fish? Louis and Elodie. So that's two more suspects. Exactly. Can you call in Louis, by the way? - Summon, you mean. - Yes, that's right. Right, madam. Madam, Louis Issautier. Take a seat. You didn't tell me your friend, Elodie Pasquier, had been sexually harassed by Pascal Achard. I didn't think there was a link. You thought wrong, my dear man. When the law looks into a murder, everything could be related. - What do you want? First, that you change your tone. You took part in a hunt with your partner's aggressor. - I've a lot of questions. - You're asking so many! You know the shot wasn't from my rifle. So what now? You've got a motive. I didn't kill him. Maybe even a double motive. Excuse me? You knew your mother had an affair with Pascal Achard. Yes, I found out recently. - What do you mean by "recently"? - Recently. I didn't kill him. What do you want? You're pissing me off! I suggest you calm down, Mr Issautier, knowing there are suspicions against you. If you don't speak I'll take you into custody. I've nothing more to say. Very well. One night in the station will make you more talkative. You're in custody. Chief warrant officer, please. How did your meeting with Achard's last mistress go? She was mad at him. But she's got a solid alibi: she's a teacher and was at school during the hunt. I heard you took Louis Issautier into custody. Got a better suspect? If I knew the culprit, yes. But it's not Louis. You know everybody. It can help you or obstruct your open-mindedness in this case. Tell me what's wrong. Want to take me off the case? Why be so radical? I just want us to work together. Then stop making decisions alone! REQUEST FOR AN ADOPTION CONSENT CHILD CARE SERVICES It's because of that stupid Elodie that Louis is in custody. I agree. I think she's pushy. Toxic, actually. What do you say, Paul? What do you want me to say? He's in jail because of that loony and you've nothing to say? He's not in jail, just in custody. The deputy prosecutor will soon realise he didn't kill him. Really! And how? She'll have to find the real culprit first. Your prosecutor seems to be damn screwing up. That's enough! And you, Faustine, stop criticizing Elodie. Poor little darling. You've always defended them. First her family, now her. And we never knew why. She's lost her family, she's an orphan, and I help all those in Cadenet who're in trouble. It's the least a successful family like ours can do for her. - That's too easy... Be quiet! In any case, it's always the same... Yes, it's Daniel. I want more. I don't care, it's your problem. 30,000. 30,000, this evening. 30,000 this evening, thief. Hi, you OK? Hey! He opened up to you! Elodie Pasquier, Louis Issautier, both guilty. With all due respect, you're completely lost, deputy prosecutor. You disagree with the way I lead the investigation, Captain? - I didn't say so. - You did. - What's that? - Elodie's hospital report. 3 admissions in 4 years. I'll check on her. If you want to solve the investigation, since I'm totally lost, go ahead, I'd be the first to congratulate you. Yes. It's true I was ill. 3 admissions in psychiatry in 4 years, that's the least you could say. Was your depression because of Achard? No. - It started long before that. - Before what? I left home when I was 15. I didn't get on with my parents. They were teachers, they wanted me to be one too. I wanted to choose my life. I like working with wicker, not facing thirty-odd idiots. Luckily, not all students are idiots. What went so wrong with your parents? There'd always been something wrong with them. A family secret that ruins your life. Now... every family has secrets. I don't know. It was taboo. We never spoke about it together. Now that they're dead... I know that. A car accident, right? Yes. That's why you were depressed. Losing your parents at 16 is... is too painful, I guess. I think of them every day. I read in the hospital reports that you were prone to... aggressive urges. - They talk nonsense. - They sure do. Like all students are idiots. Correct. You didn't feel like acting on those urges recently, Elodie? You think I killed Achard? Then why take Louis into custody? I should be in his place. I don't believe anything, Just wondering. And it doesn't erase my suspicions about Louis. It's just the opposite. Everything's almost set. You'll be ready for your medal ceremony. Shall we welcome the minister in the tasting hall? It's perfect. What's that? Our new blend. Syrah, Grenache and a touch of Mourvèdre. Black fruits, truffles... leather, undergrowth. Exactly! Full in the mouth. Not bad. Very good, you mean. We'll get a gold medal with that. How are you feeling? OK. Not too bad. With all that's happened... I think you're facing up to Pascal's death rather well. Don't say you were jealous. That's not the word I'd use. I'd rather say... surprised you didn't get tired of him sooner. So surprised you could have killed him? Knowing he was shot instead of a wild boar is quite pleasing, I must say. - We need to talk. - I'm all ears. You're a jinx, Elodie, to all the people around you. What do you mean? My brother's in custody because of you. Because of me? You quite liked Achard. If you'd left him alone, we'd be fine. You're a tease. Say that again? Just leave my family alone, especially Louis! You have no orders to give me. Get out! You're right, I'm off. I'm sick of your freeloader's face. You loony! I'll go to the prosecutor and tell her you're nuts. You'll be forced to tell her your secrets. You loony... Stay away, it's dangerous! Deputy prosecutor, Captain. We found a body inside. Wait, can I see? How horrible! Thank you. Think it's an accident? It started in the lounge. It's not a short-circuit. An accident... 90 % sure it wasn't. It's arson. - OK. Thanks, Captain. - Welcome. I'll call the coroner, he'll tell us more. You're free. New events mean we no longer need to keep you into custody. But stay nearby. I guess you have no intention of leaving? I don't. Fine. You can go. OK. Thanks. Bye. I just spoke to the coroner. Daniel Achard was knocked out. That means we've got a second murder. Look what was found. - 30,000 euros. - No. - Where was it? - In the garage, under boxes. An Achard speciality. All old notes with inconsecutive numbers. I made inquiries about his car. - His nice 4X4. - Yes. He paid in cash: 35,00 euros. The car dealer confirmed. Isn't it forbidden? It's 1,000 euros max in cash. I'll send the tax office to him. - No time for that now. - Right. Let's forget about cheated husbands. They wouldn't pay thousands of euros. So it might be blackmail? Yes. But they were related. They could have shared the dough. 50,000 euros for one, 30,000 and a 4x4 for the other. That makes 65,000 euros. And Daniel Achard raised the bidding. And made his debtor go mad. Hold on. Excuse me. Hello. Yes. No, tell me. Why? That's not what you told me. I didn't get that. I told you that in any case, I couldn't... Look, I can't talk to you now. I'll call you back. You OK? Yes. Great. Can I help you? In what way? Well, I don't know. With the adoption? Who told you about that? Caroline? She didn't. She cares far too much for you to tell me anything. The other day, you dropped a file, and I understood. Don't worry. There's always a solution. You were never a vine fan, were you, Mum? Louis. Actually, I've always been a fashion fan. You know that. I'd have rather lived in Paris. We don't always do what we want to. I wonder how you managed to cope for so long. I love your father. And I love you, and I love your sister. I'm glad she's studying in Paris. It's an opportunity to go there more often. You're bored, here. I am, in a way. A little boredom in life isn't that bad. It helps focus on oneself. Was Achard due to boredom? I saw you at Saint-Rémy, at the votive festivities. You're mad at me? Not at you. I'm mad at him. I'm a bit mad at myself too. - Why? - Because there is an age when we can do without certain things and it helps you focus on what's really important. And what's important, Mum? To have you, to have my family. I've brought the drinks. - It's the new vintage? - It is. Not bad. 11.5 degrees, right? Exactly. I heard that Daniel Achard had died in the fire. Think it was an accident? How could I know? First his uncle, now him. Isn't this all a bit weird? As for Pascal and his affairs, there could be an explanation. As for Daniel, I must say... If both deaths are related, women have nothing to do with the murder of Pascal Achard. What do you say? Honestly, nothing. Achard had an affair with Françoise. - Could you have wanted... - Revenge? Yes. No. Dad! The hazards of life. I wasn't really affected. I know Françoise loves me. That's all that counts. Two things mean a lot to me: our family and the success of Louis and Faustine. Are you going to let Louis make organic wine? I'm getting used to the idea. Good. Is the Captain in? He's in a meeting. For the investigation or the adoption? "The adoption"? You know about it? I shouldn't talk about it. But since Charles has confided in you... Not exactly, in fact. But I do know about it. It's driving him bonkers. For sure. Knowing it's not that easy for a bachelor. It's been driving him crazy for over 6 months. I'm the only one in the know. Well, I was. Naturally. We share the same office. This boy is full of surprises. I agree with you. But sometimes, I feel sad for him. He's not himself, these days. He's sad. Now I understand why he stood me up. He got a text from a social worker. He can't miss such appointments. Did you stop because of me? - Not at all. - No, we were chatting. I've got something on Issautier. Which one? Lucien, the patriarch. I met the former deputy mayor, who knew them, and he talked about himself, and the village. Apparently, Lucien was in the Résistance and was head of a network. A hero! That's nice. But in what way does it help us? Apparently, his past wasn't all that glorious. Explain. Hold on. Mount Ventoux was in the hands of the Resistance. Tragic events often took place here, like in February 1944. Please, I beg of you. - Come on, get ready! - Don't shoot... I didn't do anything. Fire! Know what her name was? - No idea. - Clémentine Lemercier. The great-grandmother of one of your suspects, Elodie Pasquier. - No way! - She was. So that could be her family secret. - And this Clémentine... - Lemercier. Clémentine Lemercier was shot for collaborating? She was accused of denouncing Captain Chaumont's network. And who was Captain Chaumont? Who is Captain Chaumont. Captain Chaumont was the war name of Lucien Issautier. There you are! Well done. - Good job, Captain. - I know, thanks. Excuse me. ...pretty as a majorette. - Elodie. Sorry. - Yes. Can I talk to you? - To me? - Yes. Yes, sure. Somewhere a little quieter. There, in the café. Well done! Paul Issautier, leave a message. I discovered your family secret. You did? Clémentine Lemercier, does it ring a bell? It does. She was my great-grandmother. She died during the war. She was in the Resistance network of Lucien Issautier, aka Captain Chaumont. And apparently... she denounced them. Now I understand why we couldn't speak about her. You know, for years, I tried to understand. I tried to question Lucien about that famous family secret. And each time, he brushed aside my questions, saying: "Forget about the past. It cannot be changed." But how come he always supported your family? Apparently, your forebear betrayed him. What do you think? I don't know. You don't? Captain. Don't move. - What's that? - It's for my collection. You know the prosecutor knows everything? I do. I didn't tell her. I'm not a snitch. It's our secret. I know, Caroline. It was our secret and we were unmasked. Can I tell you something? We make a great team, chief warrant officer Martinez. That's... That's a compliment. I really mean it. How did it go with the social worker? It's complicated because I'm single. I should be married or in a civil union, in a relation. It won't be complicated for such a handsome man. Thanks for that, but... you can't find the right person just like that. If you find the right person, you may not need to adopt a child. Your new girlfriend could have children. True, I didn't think of that. Do you want children? Is that a proposition? Well... No. It's a question, just a question. Faustine. Yes. - Seen your dad? - No. Why? He went to get a pullover and he's not answering his phone. I've got it. He lent it to me. Really? Sorry. Something up, Mrs Issautier? My husband went home to pick up a pullover, but he's not come back and he's not answering his phone. Something's wrong. He sponsors this event, he never misses it. I've got a bad feeling. Let's go. - Anna. - Yes. - Have you seen Mr Issautier? - He's in the tasting room. He's over there. No! Elodie. What did she want? To talk about my great-grandmother. Your great-grandmother? Why? I haven't got a clue. I think she suspects me. Shit! You're sure? Yes. - We've got a prob. - Sorry? "A prob"? Yes, and a big one. Where? Sorry, excuse me. Did you notice anything unusual lately? Was he depressed? No. He even had projects. He thought his new vintage would get the gold medal. No, really, I... I don't get it. Me neither. Depression is not... like him. He's a fighter. You just don't understand. You're all a bunch of idiots. Your eyes are clogged with shit. He did everything for the estate. Dad... he took care of everyone. It all... just got to him, that's all. And you, Mr Issautier? Well... I haven't got a clue, madam. I'm an old man... I can't fathom all this. He looked really strange, old Lucien Issautier. Bizarre. As though his son's attempted suicide didn't surprise him. Maybe he suspected something. Perhaps. The Issautiers have the 100,000 euros to hush a blackmailer. Well, two, in fact. To keep a secret from WWII? It was 70 years ago, but it'd have repercussions nowadays. Or could thwart projects like the medal of merit. I think we're burning, Captain. Especially if you eat off my plate. They'll think we're in a relation. Enough for you to tell me why such a stunner is determined to adopt on his own? It's always been my dream... to have a family, children. At a reasonable age, not like my father. He died when I was 17. I understand. When I met my ex, I thought she was the love of my life. We'd even bought a house. But sadly, we couldn't have children. We tried every available treatment, but nothing worked. So we turned to... to adoption. As time went by, I realized she didn't want a child. I think that the adoption paperwork, after trying everything else, was the last straw and led to us splitting up. It's sad. Yes, it's sad. I didn't want to give up. I was too involved. I couldn't step down, so I persevered on my own with the adoption. You're very brave to want to adopt a child. It's difficult. The other day, when I got upset, they were telling me that since I didn't have my own house and I was single, it wouldn't work out. Well... start by finding your soul mate. I know of someone. Who? Caroline. She always looks at you so lovingly. Haven't you ever noticed? I don't pay attention to such things. - The ball is in your court. - Anyway, you've an appointment at the clerk's office in Apt. Why? That's where the archives of the militia are conserved. I thought you should go there. What time? 8 a.m. At 8 a.m.! How are you, Paul? You're worrying about me? You've always been a rock. I never thought that you could be fragile, vulnerable, suicidal. Why did you do that? Because of me? Because I used to be so severe, before I retired? Of course not. I'd gotten used to it. Then why did you do that? It's not like you! There must be a reason. Perhaps. Tell me, have you messed up, Paul? Dad... I've never done anything that could harm our family or my children's future. Never. Captain. You were right about the archives. Come on, we've work to do. If ever I still had illusions about human nature, they've all vanished. It's so disgusting! All anonymous letters denouncing Jewish children. Here's another one. Better still. It's signed "a friend of France" who denounced a café owner listening to radio London. Undoubtedly someone envious of her business. Look at this. What is it? A document kept top secret by the French police, concerning the hearing of a man who denounced a network of maquisards. If it was a man, it wasn't Clémentine Lemercier. So, what do we have? The Achards blackmailed the Issautiers, that seems more than likely. Paul and Louis Issautier were at the hunt... Paul tried to commit suicide yesterday. He was feeling remorse. Come in. Captain. A fisherman found this gun in a pond, near to where P. Achard was killed. It's a CZ 557 rifle, a 300 Win calibre. The same calibre as the murder weapon. And we've got a print. - I guess you know everything. - Yes. We found the rifle you threw in the pond, with fingerprints. Can you tell us how it happened? Pascal. Paul, why are you here? Remembered what I asked you? You've become very greedy. What are you doing? Threatening me? I'm not. - The tax office is after me. - OK. You spend too much on women. That's my problem. Your family is indebted to mine. It's all about honour. Hurry up with the money. I've got the proof here. Otherwise... What? The Issautiers' nice reputation will be blown away. People will discover what you really are: bastards. Think about your son. He's your successor, right? It's hard to bear a sullied name. I got it. - Pretty, huh? - Well done, Louis! And what was that letter? It was for Elodie Pasquier. Who wrote it? Francis Achard, Pascal's father. He and my father were in the Maquis. He had a heart attack when writing it. Pascal kept it. But why kill Daniel Achard? He'd taken over. I don't care. 30,000 this evening. He kept asking for more. I thought it'd never end. Bring it this evening. I've got proof. I'll reveal everything. I wanted my family to live peacefully, for my children to be serene. Bad timing, with the medal you were to get. True. That distinction was meant for the whole family. It awarded the work of several generations. My father, mainly. I couldn't bear to think his reputation would be sullied, that his former life could spoil Louis'. Your suicide attempt was a way of denouncing yourself? How could I live with that on my conscience? I'm not a murderer. What was in the letter that led you to kill? It destroyed all that I had believed in, my family above all. I wanted to protect them. And where's that letter now? I sent it to its legitimate addressee, Elodie. I think she will be comforted after reading it. "Elodie, we don't really know each other. "But before I die, I must ease my conscience. "This is about your great-grandmother, "poor Clémentine Lemercier. "Lucien was madly in love with her. "He was even ready to marry her, "although she already had a child. "But Clémentine left him for another, "a pal of the Maquis, Raymond. "We were barely 20 years old, "and I had enrolled in that Maquis, lead by Captain Chaumont, "Lucien, that you know so well. "Now, what I'm going to tell you is terrible, Elodie. "One evening, "I'd gone down to the village to have a coffee at the café. "In the street, "two men were talking. "I recognized one of them. He was a militiaman. "The other had his back to me. "They each went their way and I followed him." - Lucien? - Francis. Why were you with that militiaman? He's one of ours, a double agent. Francis, don't go back to the Maquis. - Raymond has ratted on us. - What? Go away! "He was nervous, anxious. "I'd known him since primary school. "I didn't believe him, but I pretended to. "After Lucien's betrayal, "the very next day, the militia attacked the camp. "All our comrades were killed. "I lost all of them. "Of course, I have no proof, "just a firm conviction. "How could Raymond have betrayed the network "as he was also killed by the FFI?" Why did you give us away? I didn't do anything. "Sadly, that's not the end of the story." You're going to die. Who did you tell about us? Answer, bitch! - I didn't do anything. - Open your eyes. No pity for the traitors. I didn't do anything! Let go of me! No! Please, I beg of you! Take aim! Fire! I read Achard's letter. I know all the wrong you did. You pretend you're a hero, but you were the traitor. I don't get it, Lucien. Why? To take revenge. So that Raymond, who took Clémentine from me, would be shot. Jealousy... Love drove me crazy, Elodie. You let Clémentine be shot. No, that's not true, I didn't! The FFIs arrested Clémentine because she was living with Raymond. You denounced her, Lucien! I didn't. I cared for her, I loved her. It was a terrible string of events, a fatality. You let her die. You did nothing, even though you loved her. To save her... I would have had to turn myself in. I didn't have the courage. Why didn't you tell the truth after the war? That's the terrible rule... of lies. Once you start lying... you can never turn back. But I tried to rehabilitate Clémentine, you know that. By making Raymond a traitor. You don't get it. In the 50s, I started a family. If I turned myself in, I was scared I'd lose them. You're such a coward. You always find good excuses: your wild love, your family... You let Clémentine be shot because you didn't have the courage to turn yourself in. I admired you. You were my hero. Louis. What are you doing? You're so disgusting! You're grotesque! I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of you, of my family. Louis, I had no choice. It was Elodie's family or mine. - Ours! Understand? Our family. - Louis! - Louis, stop it! - Stop! Don't move! What do you want to do? Stop! You want to kill your grandfather? - It'll make no difference. - Don't move! Stop it, Louis! Don't screw up. Think of Elodie, of you two. You've got your life to live. I'm begging you, Louis. Listen to us. Stop it! Don't spoil your life, Louis. Put the gun down. Good. Put it down. It'll be OK. - Good, Louis. - Louis. Louis. It'll be OK. What do we do with Lucien? Nothing. There is a statute of limitations. Now, it's between him and his conscience. My conscience! It's been weighing on me since the war. I think a thousand years wouldn't do. Don't worry, madam, I don't intend suffering that long. I must apologise to you, Elodie. I didn't know Grandpa had done so much wrong. Nobody knew about it. Except for Dad. He did it to protect us. How long will he get? 20 years... at least. The real hero in the family is your father, not your grandfather, who crushed him. It's strange to see leaving. I'll miss you. We'll meet again, Caroline. - Can I hug you, madam. - Sure! Call me Elisabeth. I really enjoyed working with you, Caroline. - Same here. - See you. - See you. - See you. Elisabeth, it's my turn to say I really enjoyed working with you. Same here. I've even got a gift for you. Really? Thanks! - What is it? - A heavy metal album. Super! Well, we did make a good pair. A good trio, with Caroline. - I hope we'll work together again. - That'd be nice. In the meantime, I wish you all the best, Captain: to meet the love of your life, have children, and if you're determined to adopt a child, I'm willing to give you a character reference. You'd make a great dad. Thanks, that's kind. From what I saw, your son's lucky to have you. I'll record that and make him listen to it non-stop. Ah, there. Talk about the devil! Yes, sweetie. I'll just put you on hold. Well, bye, Charles. It was a pleasure. Keep in touch. I sure will. - You there? - Yes. - Yes, sweetie. - So? - I'm on my way. - Alright. Who's Charles? The Captain of the gendarmerie with whom I just worked. - Is he nice? - Yes. I'm leaving right now. So, if there's no traffic...
