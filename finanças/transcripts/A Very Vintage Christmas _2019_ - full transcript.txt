Or more depressed. [Water dripping] Olivia. Look at this. It's... It's flooded. Everything we worked for. How much of our stock is damaged. Any of it is too much. We can't afford to lose a thing. [Sighs] This is a disaster. And if it rains again, it's going to flood again. Oh, Dodie, I could cry. We were so close to opening. What do we do? Do you know a good contractor? Our beautiful wood floors, so much of our merchandise and we open tomorrow night? Well, we'll get some fans in here right away. I mean, most of this will dry up nicely. That wall's going to need some work, a little patch, a little plaster, a fresh coat of paint, and we gotta fix the roof, 'cause it's obviously still leaking. How much is this going to cost?

If it's the price, we'd be happy to discuss it. - Did I mention it's very rare? - Thank you, dear. Getting the same reaction. Everyone's looking. Yeah, and not buying. [Whispers] Dodie, I thought you were supposed to put that away? Um, excuse me sir. I am so sorry, that's not for sale. Are you sure? I'm only interested in this one item. This key. I'm a collector. Well, we shouldn't have left it out. We don't even know what it opens. That's no mystery. See the number etched on the top there? It's a post office box key. Huh. Post office box. That's a great party, decent crowd, considering. Plus hey, we got the lead on that key so we can check that out tomorrow. Well, unless winter storm Megan circles back from the Midwest. Oh and what, break this town's record for snowless holidays? Not a chance. And if it did, well, that'd be a miracle. I'm very big on miracles this time of year. Now that, I believe. [Chuckles] Goodnight, Dodie. Goodnight Ed. Hmm. Looks like I gave up the gym just in time. These are fantastic. You want one? Well, at least a few people know we're here. What did we sell? Hmm, five candlesticks, four dresses, three coats, two clocks... And a partridge in a pear tree. What does that add up to? Hmm, not enough. What else can we do? Free gift wrapping or discounts? Ed as Santa. That'll be the day. He's not very big on costumes. Hmm. A new website then. I could build it on Wix in no time and link it up to other sites, bring in some tourists, maybe even sell some of our items online, too. I think we've been going at this all wrong. The problem is, we have been trying to sell things. Right, isn't that the whole point of a store? What we should be selling are the stories behind them. A customer might not want to buy this car, but if it might once have been on Ernest Hemingway's library shelf, or might have been filled with roses from a silent film star's garden. A personal approach. Aha. [Together] Everything has a story. Post office, how may I help you? Excuse me. I was wondering if you could give us some information about the original owner. It's one of ours all right. 11. It's a bit of a legend around here. What was so special about that one? Never any mail. None. But we still receive regular cheques to pay for it. We all wonder what the story is. Someone's been paying for this box all these years? Every month like clockwork. Do you want to check it out? Your key after all. Um, I guess, yeah, sure. Thanks. Anything in there? A ring. And a note. "Ginger. Will you marry me? Carl." Yes. This is so romantic. Yeah except that... Except what? Well... Carl proposed, just like we thought. This proves it. Except the ring and the note are still here, so all it really proves is that Ginger didn't pick it up. Oh. Oh. Well, why wouldn't she pick it up? I don't know, could be a million reasons for that. All I need is one that makes sense. Ed, the ring. It's been sitting here for years waiting for her to see it and read the proposal. I wonder what Carl was thinking. Was he waiting for her to show up, waiting for her to call? What could've happened, and what should we do with this? It's not ours. It's not anyone's. [Sighs] It's really sad. Carl Baylor, that's right. A cheque every month. Can you give us the address? You want the address? You have the key, but you don't know where he lives. That seems a bit odd. Uh, we lost touch. He's my uncle. Haven't seen him in years. So maybe you could help us out. Uncle or not, that wouldn't be possible. Can I talk to you for a second, just privately? Yes? [Whispering] I was just, you know, wondering how much your box rentals are. [Whispering] Why are we whispering? Our prices aren't secret. This should answer all your questions. Oh yeah. Oh, I see. Okay, yeah, thank you, um. I'll be in touch. [Whispering] Hey, are you... [clears throat] You... you ready? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. (Dodie) I think he's somewhere in Wheatland. It's not that far. It's about 30 miles up the road. Listen, I mean, I know this is what we've been after all this time, but you still sure this is a good idea, given what we know? I can't stop now. There have been too many times in my life when I hadn't followed through, so I have to finish this. We know this story isn't going to have a happy ending. Maybe they eloped before she found her ring. And never came back for it? Okay, maybe it's something else. But whatever it is, I need to hear it for myself. Dodie. Come on, we, we just need to be realistic here. Why not be hopeful? Be supportive, be on my side? I am on your side, okay? I'm just trying to protect you. Protect me. Yes. Look, I am capable, perfectly capable, of protecting myself. Wait. Is this about us? Dodie, how... how could this be about us? I have no idea what you want. All I know is it's definitely not now, and it's not me. I thought we were on the same page. Finding these two people will prove I am not wrong to believe in them. Okay, but what if this relationship isn't what you think it is? What if it's all just in your mind and... and it ends up hurting you? [Sighs] Right. I gotta go. Dodie, don't be mad, okay? I'm not mad. I'm... I'm confused. I'm upset. Okay, maybe I'm mad. Dodie. Bye. [Doorbell rings] Don't worry about her, she'll be back. Do you mind if I sit? It's your cafe. You know, I have seen a lot of relationships in my time. Good, bad, everything in between. People forget when a waitress is around. Frustrating sometimes, but oh my, the things we learn. For instance? For instance, you two. You're a match. In case you didn't hear what she said. Don't go by what she says. She's wild about you, that's what scares her. It's an old story. Two people who fit but afraid to admit it, so they find reasons to stay apart. You'd think it was the end of the world, and like I said, you two are a match. Like my husband and me. How long have you been married? Oh. Since before you were born. Okay, so... What you're saying is the moral of the story is don't give up? Sure. Go with that. And always tip your waitress. ♪ This shawl will be a conversation piece. And to think it might've been on Cole Porter's piano in the 1920s, I mean... Merry Christmas. That approach and this website is exactly what we need. The customers love the stories, and our online sales are through the roof. And you're not listening to a word I'm saying. I'm sorry. Carl Baylor's address. He's so close. So now what? You have to think this through. You know, Ed thinks this is a mistake. What if he's right? What if this is all some silly wild goose chase? What if it is? Either way, I need to know. I am going to find out what happened. [Doorbell rings] Well, hello there. And Merry Christmas. I'm looking for a Carl Baylor? You found him. Sorry, I, uh,... I just got home and I... I didn't have time to... to change. So how can I help you? Now I'm not so sure. All this, the neighbourhood kids expect it. Adults too. Would you care to step in? It's a little nippy out there. Yes, thank you so much. [Chuckles] You're Mr. Baylor. You're Carl Baylor? [Chuckles] Well, don't let the fur trim fool ya. As I say, I just got off work and, uh, sometimes it takes me a few minutes to get out of character. You see, uh, being one of Santa's helpers, it is a very complicated business. I wasn't expecting quite so much. Well, playing Santa for a living, it's all or nothing. Have a... have a seat. [Sighs] [groans] Do I know you? My name is Dodie Brite. I have a new shop in Mountain View. Oh. And as it happens, I bought this wardrobe, and one day I was dusting it, and I ended up opening up a drawer. So that's why I'm here. That's quite a story. I couldn't stop until I found you and Ginger. That wasn't her real name, by the way. It wasn't? No, we, uh, we met at a dance back in the '70s. She moved like a dream, like a... a movie star, so... I just called her Ginger. Ginger Rogers. [Laughs] That's one of her favourites. I never got into the old movies, myself. So she kept all those things? All those memories? That... that takes my breath away, just the thought of it. This was one of them. [Laughs] I never expected to see this again. Not in a million years. She was something, you know. She really cared about things, you know? I've never met her equal. I know this isn't right, but... I opened the post office box. Is the ring still there? And the note. All these years. That's a miracle in itself. I gave this to her the last time we were together. When you're ready to make it work, use this. [Sighs] I always hoped that eventually she'd change her mind, use the key, find the ring. Crazy I know, but I never had the heart to stop paying for the box. Do you have any idea where she is now? Not a clue. She broke it off. Asked me to honour that. As hard as it was, I... I kept that promise. Do you mind if I try to find her? I'd like to know where her life took her. Suit yourself. This uh, here's her real name. At least what it was when I last knew her. Oh, you might check that out too. Charity dance? I'm playing Santa. You should come. I'm really glad I found you. Me too. Merry Christmas. Dodie, look at this. Customers everywhere. Business is better every day. That's good. Look, I'm sorry you didn't find your happy ending, but at least you know the story now. Not the whole story, but soon. [Sighs] Now that I have her real name, I thought it would be a snap. But there are so many people with this name, and none of them... [gasps] Wow. Did you find something? Her. I found her. Olivia. This, this is amazing, and she's still in town, and... And? You're not going to believe the rest. I'm not even sure I do. [Doorbell] Hello?... Hi. Uh, I thought we weren't speaking. We aren't. We weren't. But we have to now. Okay. I may have overreacted. Okay, I definitely overreacted. But can we talk about that later? Ed, I need you to come with me. I have news. About Carl and Ginger? Did you find out the whole story? Half of it. I'm headed out to hear the rest, but I need you to come with me. You're serious? Yes, I'm serious. Right now. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Before you head out, uh, you need to clean up a little. Sawdust... Oh. ...paint. Yeah. Like right now. Okay, okay, fine! So what are we doing here? Do you want to meet Ginger or not? At the cafe? Wait. Is it? You'll have to wait and see. So all this time she was serving us dessert? That's cra... here she comes. Act natural. Welcome, folks. Nice to see you again, together and all. What can I get for you today? Oh, thank you. Uh, maybe it's what we can do for you. Dodie? Um, a hot chocolate would be fine. Thanks. Ed? Uh yeah, uh, yeah, hot chocolate, please. Be just a minute. What is happening? When are you going to give her the box? How did you find her? So, first I met with Carl. I told him the whole story, I showed him the key... Ed. Dodie. Mom! I hope I haven't kept you waiting. I had a client desperate to find a place before Christmas, so his daughter would have a place to hang her stockings. Isn't that adorable? Yeah. I asked your mother to join us for lunch. Well, isn't that a nice surprise. Is this a special occasion? [Stammers] I... I... I don't know. Is it? Oh, three now, is it? Something to drink? Um, whatever they're having is fine. Hi, okay, uh, so what's happening? We wanted to return this to you. To my mother? [Sighs] Where... where did you find this? It belonged to Maggie Preston. Your maiden name of course. But why Maggie? Margaret, it was just, it was too stuffy back then. So we've been looking for you this entire time? [Sighs] I haven't seen this in so long. I found it hidden in an old wardrobe, and Ed helped me find its rightful owner, and I believe that's you. The gingerbread competition second place. Of course, there were only two entries that year. [Laughs] Ours was truly terrible. But we had so much fun. Oh, this is the first rose a boy ever gave me. I slept with this under my pillow for weeks, as you can tell. [Laughs] What about this? It says, "for Ginger." That's what Carl called me when we first met. Well, when we first danced. An old movie reference. You wouldn't know it. There we go. Let me know if there's anything else. This was long before I met your father. Long before, for a time, this was... it was just perfect. Only for a time? I had these dreams of an art career, and... and... and I was just obsessed, I was determined that nothing would stand in my way, not even Carl. I foolishly thought that it had to be a career or the love of my life. One or the other. And by the time I figured out my mistake, he was gone. And so I just packed all my beautiful memories in this box and just moved on. So, is that when you met my father? You know... [sighs] ...it just looked really good on paper. I just, I didn't want to make the same mistake twice. We never had that spark. And you know how that worked out. But it wasn't a total loss. We did have the most wonderful boy in the world. Oh! My Christmas pin! Oh, my, oh my gosh! You... You have no idea what this means to me. Thank you. [Jazzy piano version of "Silent Night"] ♪ All those years Margaret lost, I wish there was some way to make things happen. It's too late to get them back together, I suppose. If only you had seen the way she looked at everything in that box. Hmm. She still loves him. I know it. Maybe it's impossible, but I need to make this happen. Are you doing this for Margaret or are you doing it for Ed? You say no, but I think you have a soft spot for the guy. I'm doing this for Carl and Ginger. This is just like the old days at Christmas. We used to sit out on the porch and drink hot chocolate. Only better. You've done such a great job here. Yeah, you know what, I'll finish the inside next week, but feels good to have this much done. Have you thought about keeping it? Just moving back? You must be so tired of travelling. [Laughs] Uh yeah, it's crossed my mind. I mean, I travelled clear across the country and then just forgot why I even left. Well, everybody needs some time to think things over. You know, to be honest, I've missed the town. You know, missed my life here. Missed you. Well then, move back Eddie. We could work together. You could flip 'em, I could sell 'em, we'd make a great team. We would, we would. Is there something else? Yeah. Just this, you know, this Carl and Ginger thing, I... I'm only hearing about this now. You had enough to deal with, growing up with a single mother, making do. Yeah, but I can't help but think what your life would've been like if... you didn't have to raise me. If it wasn't because of me, you... Eddie, you were the best part of my life. I wouldn't change a single thing. Yeah, but you had to do it alone, Mom. I mean, if I had known, maybe I could've helped you, or... You did help. Just by being my son. [Phone rings] Dodie. Excuse me. Hey you. I have an idea. Your mom still likes to dance, I bet. Uh, yeah, sure. Why? That sounds good. That sounds very good. All right, bye. Something important? Uh, something fun. What are your thoughts on going to a Christmas dance? [Laughs] Ed says that the theme is Winter Wonderland. I don't have anything that's right for that. So I was thinking vintage. Um, well, what about this one? It's straight out of the '40s. That is so gorgeous. Don't you think that's too glamorous for me? Oh, no. Not at all. You would look so beautiful in this, Margaret. You think? Absolutely. I'll take it. Oh, I do wish you were going along tonight. You could get a ride with me and Ed. Ah, well, we're open late tonight, and it's my turn to lock up. Maybe I'll meet you there later? The truth is, you're the one that should be going with Ed. He needs somebody like you in his life. Ed is a wonderful man. She says the timing isn't right. Really? What is it, Dodie? Is it the store? Love is love. Hmm. And all it cares about is love. You're a very smart lady, Margaret. Smart lady's made a lot of foolish choices in her life. That could be a cautionary tale for you. How much do I owe you? Oh no, no, no. This is from me. No, I couldn't... Consider it a Christmas gift. Yeah, no. Sorry. It's done. Thank you so much. No. Merry Christmas. Out of curiosity, if you are going tonight, what are you going to wear? I have the entire store to choose from. Ah. Well, you know, if you're wondering, Ed likes red. Oh, stop it. Both of you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Have a wonderful time, bye. Dodie! It's red. They'll be here any time now. You know the dance doesn't start for an hour. Well, that's the idea. To give Santa and Ginger some alone time. Ooh, clever girl. Yes. There you go. I'm a little nervous. If you weren't, I'd be a little worried. I mean it, I've spent so many years wondering about this moment, if it should ever happen again. And yet, you know, if this goes well, Santa could be the one getting the best gift this year. Anybody home? Dodie! I thought you couldn't make it. Until later. Olivia, she offered to cover the store for me tonight. That was so nice of her. Love the dress. Oh. Isn't it beautiful, don't you like that colour? [Laughs] Oh, wait a minute. Are we early? There's no one here. Did I show up early? Uh, I don't know, maybe we both did. Uh, but hey, there's music, decorations, we've got Santa over here. What more do you need? Hey, Santa. Come join us. [Chuckles] Oh, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. And who do we have here? Ed Willoughby. Hope I'm on the good list. [Laughs] And this is my mother. Margaret. So nice to meet you, Santa. Margaret, you say. You don't look like a Margaret to me. No? Well then who? It'll come to me. A beautiful pin you're wearing. Oh, thank you. It was a gift, many years ago. Oh. From someone special? He was. We lost touch. A shame when that happens. Yeah, well. We can't turn the clock back. Nonsense. Haven't you heard? At Christmas, my dear Margaret, anything is possible. [Laughs] Well, I'm afraid there are times when that's true, and...
