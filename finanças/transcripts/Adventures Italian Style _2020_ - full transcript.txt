None of us came this far to have hoisted ourselves. We're here because someone bent down and helped us. OCTOBER 1989 When you're 23, you don't know how you end up in certain situations. You just end up in them. Maybe Bibi needed to prove something... to a girl, rather than to himself. Are you sure it was here? Rice hasn't figured out what he needs yet. Not even now when he is 50. Don't know... Everything looks the same. As for me... I couldn't have imagined what would have happened during this trip. Maybe... it was all I was looking for. It wasn't here, guys... You were driving then... Guys! Oh, shit! BASED ON A TRUE STORY Now the theme song! See you tomorrow! Thank you very much! Let's have a look... We're going towards Europe in which we will enter with enthusiasm, I recon. After the request of the American president Reagan to tear down the wall that divides Germany, and after a meeting with Gorbachev, it seemed that the Cold War had come to an end. Free kick for Domini, Calcaterra was free, but didn't touch the ball that touches the ground and enters the net. After 9 minutes we have a doubling. Another free kick by Domini. Bologna's defence is on holidays and Agostini ends the match. Bologna attacks and Cesena tries to fight back. Piraccini highlights Cusin's acrobatics... Maifredi tries to mix things up replacing Stringara with Monza. This changes nothing about Bologna's conclusion. Pecci at the fourth. Luppi tries it on Lorenzo's assist. Cesena seems to act like a cat in front of a confused mouse. Lara, I'm sorry... I can see that. We're here together and you stare at the TV. I know this is important for you... but sometimes I'd like to do something normal. It's only for ten days... I swear next year we'll go to Puglia. Yeah... -Sardinia? -Stop it. -To Hawaii, wherever you want. -I might believe you. I had a certain idea to go to Chernobyl, but if you don't want to... I hope you find what you're looking for. And remember to call me. Every day. Of course, every single day... And tell Rice that if you don't call me I'll blame him too. Pago, hurry up! How long will this take? Don't bust my balls! I wanna go home! Just a couple more things and we're done. Hey! -How much for this? -1000 Lire. Ok, I'll take five. Let's make ten. Rice, hurry, I'm hungry... Listen, I'll take 30 of them, and add also ten bras. We'll manage well for a week in Hungary. Travel journal, 8th of October 1989, first day: from Cesena, destination Budapest! Behind the wheel, driver of a thousand trips: Maurizio Paganelli! Hey Pago, how do you feel as yourself? Hello everybody! Well... Some impressive speech! In the back we have the revelation of this trip, nobody was expecting him: Here with us Enrico Boschi, aka Bibi! Hello to Hungarian pussy! But our audience is wondering: How's Silvia? -How many miles to get there? -Almost there, just a thousand! What's in that bag? Some more women panties? Hey, don't mention Rice's bag or he'll get mad. There's stuff all of us need! -There's food, all right?! -Don't ask me when you're hungry! -Can't we buy food there? -Listen, Bibi... Did you happen to have watched the news in the last 40 years? Sports news count? -Bibi, what about the Berlin Wall? -Communism? Soviet Union? How much are you selling the panties for? It depends... Yeah, but for more than what you paid, right? -No, those are poor countries... -So you sell them for a lower price?! Are you sure you are an accountant? -I'm not an accountant yet! -It is not for the money! It's because he loves to have yard sales! I don't love yard sales! So we're going to Hungary for stupid yard sales?! I thought we went for the pussy! We're not going for the pussy! ADVENTURES ITALIAN STYLE Sofisticated! Young lady! Beautiful! I'll be right back. More austere... This is for you! Very sexy! I'm Bibi, Enrico Boschi, we're staying at Hotel Konyves... this one more sexy... Hello... To bring the passion back! To warm your nights, to make love! Love! Very good... I asked: the Austrian borders are opened. I fucking knew it... -What's up? -We're late. It's all over. -What's over? -The Soviet Union. -So? -No yard sales. Thank God! I read the Regime is still strong in Romania and Czechoslovakia. Let's go! In Czechoslovakia, 'cause Romania is a dictatorship. Would take a day. Why must we leave so soon?! He's right, now it's not the time! I wonder if Cesena scored today. Let's call home. Fuck, Lara! I know I promised, I'm sorry, but it's not that easy to make a phone call here. Yeah. How are you? Hello? Hello? Move, it's for me! Hello, Alessio? -Alessio? -Don't know yet, we'll decide tomorrow. No, we'll go either to Czechoslovakia or Romania. Let's talk about Cesena. Did they win the game? Come on, you know I'm joking, right? Bibi! How's Silvia? I didn't call Silvia, stop it! I love you too. I can't wait to be home. Sure. So... did Cesena score? Yes. All right. I have to hang up now, the others are waiting. Yes, I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Stay away with that thing! Tell me everything Bibi! Terrible news. What happened? Cesena tied the match with Lazio. 1-1 home visit. At this point the whole season is... Are you Italian? -Yes. -My name is Emil. You are from Italy. Italians are good people. Can I talk to you? A little bit. Yeah, sure. Not here. Where... Where? I come from Romania. Why are you guys here? Holidays. If you need a place to sleep... No, thanks... We're staying at Hotel Konyves. Hotel Konyves! I know that one... I heard you may be going to Romania... No, we're not going there. I've escaped... from Romania. It's been three months since I've spoken to my wife Andra and my daughter Adina. She is six. See? It was the only solution... because in Romania there's a dictator. A dictator, yes. Ceaușescu. Yes! Do you know? -I know who he is. -Listen! I have to ask you guys a favour. To bring a suitcase to Bucharest, for my family. Don't worry, guys. There is no worry. It's a suitcase with things that my family can't find there. The problem is gas. It is very expensive. There are trucks that work for the government... that will sell gas to you, in exchange for some goods. When you see a truck, at first you honk... then you use your car lights and you pass it... and then you pull over. How's the cash situation? Depends on the currency exchange, and on what we decide to do. Yup. What do we decide? Don't even think about it. All right. Everything is ending and we're missing it. We could have gone to Rimini, right?! Don't fuck with me. You don't give a fuck about the suitcase. You just seek for adventure, right? Do you realize who Ceaușescu is? -I don't. -I knew it. Here comes the accountant... Not yet an accountant! -Do you know what we'd risk? -It's not like Cesena there. Maybe there's nothing too dangerous in the suitcase... We won't bring a suitcase to some unknown people in Romania! Is there anything in life you're not afraid of? Guys, relax... It's not only a dictatorship, there's secret police, people don't have rights! Rice, look around: Is this the kind of journey you had on your mind? -A restaurant for fucking tourists? -And jail is better, right?! -We won't go to jail for a suitcase... -See? He's brave. Learn from him! He doesn't even know which country this is! Come on, Rice, it will be fun, let's do it! No! Shut up! -Come on... -Shut your mouth. You could have yard sales. Your yard sales. Your yard sales. Rice's yard sales. Yard sales. Yard sales! Did you load the trunk? -Sure. -And the map? -Yes. -Let's remember to buy toilet paper. -I stole it from the room. -You go, Rice! -How long for Romania? -Who knows! "...and with the imposition of His hands..." Papers, please! -Sorry sir, we don't speak... -Passports! I understand. We're always last. Interesting debate. -The reason for the trip? -Pardon...? -What are you doing in Romania? -The reason we are here! Holidays. This means 20 dollars for each visa. Twenty or twelve? Give him 20, he'll give you the change... You twelve! You twelve! You twelve! Twelve each... Here. Open the trunk. -The luggage... -The trunk! Rice, you're such a pain in the ass next time I'll go with Bibi alone! You graduated in tourism, you should know languages, don't be mad! -What the fuck is this? -What? -This suitcase is not ours! -Pago, what the fuck... I don't know what the fuck is this... It was that asshole before, and now we'll go to jail in Romania thanks to your fucking desire of adventure! Fuck you, Pago! I don't wanna be killed! Please! Not in this country! The suitcase is not ours and neither are the drugs! I'm excited to be visiting your Country, We've been saving for a long time for this trip... And... voilà, the trunk. Yes. Yeah, an old habit... Want a cig? Two? The pack? Go, Cesena go! Go, Cesena go! Romania, we are not afraid! You can stop here. Guys, somebody's following us. No, don't turn around, keep a low profile. -Are you sure? -Yes! I can see it! How many? I can't see. Securitate... Securitate?! -You guys, we must drop the suitcase. -Wait a sec, I'll turn here. So? Shit, they turned as well. -Fuck, fuck, fuck! -We're fucked. Lose them, Pago. -What the fuck?! -Lose them. Pago, don't listen to him. But we're faster! Don't listen to this shithead. No, but I can do it! Are you insane?! C'mon you can do it! But it could be the Police, forget it! -Grab the suitcase! -Yes, Bibi, and look inside! I don't give a fuck what's inside! Throw it! Throw that fucking suitcase! No, wait... Throw it now! Fuck you, Bibi. What are you doing Rice? -I've had enough of your bullshit! -No, Rice! -Give back the suitcase! -I'm fucking sick of it! Rice, don't! It's not following us anymore, guys. Exciting, uh? Fuck you, Pago. I almost died. So this guy puts a suitcase in our car and does not warn us... -What if he could? -Motherfucker... But what if he could? What? What if he could have said us something? But he didn't. If he told us how desperate he was, would you have helped him? -Bibi, what the fuck do you want?! -Exactly. What if I decided to help him? You joking, right? -We're the only ones... -Shut up! -The only ones that can help him! -Stop it! -It's just a suitcase! -Shut up! What was inside? I don't know. -He doesn't know! -Didn't you open it? Seemed impolite... We are travelling with an idiot! Let's go back. This is the right way. No, it's not. You were right. We should have opened it. Fuck this wind... Are you sure it was here? Don't know... Everything looks the same. It wasn't here, guys... You were driving then... Guys! Oh, shit! Come on! Where the fuck did he go... What the fuck... It's time to see if Emil was right about gas. What did he tell us? He said first honk, then pass the truck. No, first car lights then you pass the truck. I don't remember. We are Italian. We'll use gestures! -Keep driving. -Why? I said keep driving. Bibi, we need gas. -What did you do? -Holy shit. Get off. Come on. Why? Move! This gentleman here will give us thirty litres of his gas. Good. Why are you staring at me? ...then you pass it and you pull over. The right code was honk, lights and then pull over. Nope! It was honk and then suck it! Go fuck yourselves! Good evening. Good evening. -Your documents, please. -The passports. Good Evening, Hotel Turgumures speaking. I wanted to inform you about the arrival of three Italian men. Yes. Yes, sure. Yes. Excuse me... -Can we make phone calls to Italy? -Yes. Good. You have to forward a request to Bucharest. Wait while they verify your identity... and the one of the receiver... and if they confirm, you can make the call. How long will this take? It depends... a few hours, maybe tomorrow. Ok, we'll put it aside for now. Thank you. Thank you, goodbye. Goodbye. Arrivederci. -I'll aleep alone! -We'll draw the dice! Hell fucking no! I drove for 900 kilometres and I'm tired! Hey, do you know how many?! Nine hundred! Let's document this moment! This young fellow already drove for 900 kilometres! Unbelievable! How do you feel after winning the single bed? I wanna thank my mother, my father... The sublime! A thing that charms and scares! This characterized German Romanticism: vast landscapes and terrible open spaces you can't refuse to watch. Earthquakes, tsunamis... and the fixtures of Romanian hotels! Something extraordinary! Let's have another look, my friends! In the meantime, we have an Italian shithead here... Let's see what's the gastronomic offer for tonight... Just for tonight... exclusively for us, coming from far away... What's on the menu? On this menu we have big sausages! You can never go wrong with these. Eat it! Fifty-fifty, my friend! Do you think the room is bugged? No way. It's a miracle they have beds, let alone mics. Did you picture it like this? With a slight detour we can visit Dracula's Castle! Dope! What are you doing here? How did you get here? You can't visit the castle. -It is closed. -Closed? Yes. What day is it? Tuesday. She just won't let us in. -Madam... -Renovation, go away. Wait a minute... You can touch it. Good luck with memories. Guys! Come on, run! -Where did he go? -Over there! No, he went right! From the tower, we saw him in front of us, so go left! -Shall I turn here? -Yes, should be this way. Let's ask those guys. Sorry! "Poiana Brasov". -The fuck did he say? -Don't know. A red car! Poiana Brasov? It's a town, and it's on the way to Bucharest. Why not?! -Are you comfortable? -Yes, thank you. Is there any Romanian who doesn't eat garlic? There. The garlic breath reached us, too... No it's fine. -It was on the way. -Why? It's all right. -Thank you. -Goodbye. -My god... -Let's catch some fresh air. Great idea. Restaurant. Who's hungry? This must be WWF approved... Shall we sit here? -It's in Romanian... -You don't say... Do you fancy a soup? Waiter! You're showing off now? Hello! Good morning. -This one? -No. Another soup? -And this? -No. -What about this? -No. What can we order? You can order... this one. It's all they have... Dracula's son here was clever... it's the most expensive. Guys, want to bet? What's it gonna be? Imola or Faenza? -Cesena. -Almost, uh? I'm Girolamo Zorli. Who would have ever thought... I'd find three guys from Cesena in Poiana Brasov. I'm so glad, can I buy you a drink? We just ordered lunch, so... It's fine. -We don't have polenta. -Ok, won't eat anything today. Four Palinkas. So what's the buzz in Cesena? -Nothing, we came on holiday... -On holiday? In Romania?! Let's say we're here on a mission... A bit too much, but... We met a guy who asked us to bring a suitcase to Bucharest. Be careful in Bucharest. There's secret Police everywhere. -I never work in Bucharest. -We won't do anything illegal. I couldn't care less about your business, I already knew the holiday thing was a lie. Who is so stupid to go on holiday where there's a dictatorship? You don't have to worry. I'm in the field myself. What field? What field? You play your part very good, shithead. I'll call you if I'll ever need a shithead! Let's make a toast, to poverty! To the poor. So where did you hide the suitcase? -We didn't hide it, we threw it away. -We lost it. We lost it cause he threw it. So a man gives you his suitcase to bring to Bucharest... and you throw away the goods. There are no goods. We're no criminals. Criminals? Do I look like one? No. You guys look disoriented. It's better if you sleep somewhere safe tonight. You can sleep at Simona's. In Brasov. Yeah, okay, thanks. Your welcome, guys. Once you're in Bucharest... don't talk to anybody. Go to hotel Cismigiu and if you need help, call me. Here. Why must we sleep at some stranger's house in Brasov? -Seemed impolite to say no... -Impolite? With him?! That man is a criminal. -Or am I the only one who noticed? -Help, it's a criminal... Come on, let's stay the night, then tomorrow we leave for Bucharest. -Guys, we're doing a complete bullshit. -Don't be a pussy. Mom? Hello... -Mom? -Yes. -How are you? -Who are they? -They're friends. -Hello! Still friends of Girolamo? No, they're my friends. They need a place to sleep tonight. -This is not a brothel! -Don't say these things. Brothel? -Maybe we'll stay in a hotel tonight... -Yeah, no problem. No, wait. They're good people and they've come a long way. Andrea Riceputi, pleasure. We won't bother you... Ask her for some food, tell her we're hungry. -What's he saying? -They are hungry. How are they going to find anything to eat at this hour? All right, I'll cook something, but they can't sleep here. Understood? We risk a lot! We'll have serious problems if we don't declare them. All right... My mother will prepare some food for you, but then you have to leave. -All right. Thank you! -Thanks. Help me. Here. -Let's hope for tortellini! -Shut up. -It's delicious, madame. -Excellent, for real. Extraordinary. -Legumes soup. -Legumes soup! Thanks, I didn't get that! In Italian we say "minestrone"! -Minestrone. -Good! Oh, I'm so happy. "Felicità!" -She knows Al Bano and Romina! -Get out of here! How is that possible? San Remo Festival. On TV. We always watch it. -This is my mother's favourite song! -Really? This is super interesting! You changed their lives with this! "Felicità." Ok, let's be Italian... "Happiness is turning off the light to make peace." "Happiness, happiness." "Feel it, in the air there's already our love song that flies" "just like a thought that knows about happiness." Goodnight, mom. -Do we stop here? -We must. What are those people doing in line? I don't know. -How are you, Bibi? -Fine, a bit tired. -Cigarette? -A cigarette? Of course... I'm the official supplier of this country. God, you're stingy. Paganelli, you made a new friend! Go fuck yourself. -What are those people doing there? -Food. Eat. Oh, that's what the line is for. Food? You want to eat? Rice, come here. Do you have money? Biscuits? Ok! The money, please? Thank you, sir! Bye bye! Cigarettes? Yes we have them. Chocolate! There you are. Thank you, sir. -Unexpected, but very nice vibes here! -So bubbly! -That's how it's done. Uh, look at her! -She's mine. Hi, I'm Enrico Boschi! Need something? Come here, guys, do you know Cesena, Italy? Guys, help, they're too many! What are you doing here? What is this? We don't speak Romanian, sir. Papers. Documents. Passports. Yours too. Why did you come in Romania? -Why did you come here. -No, first time. To do smuggling? -I told you I don't speak... -It's forbitten! It's illegal! -Illegal! -Forgive us, we didn't know... In which hotel do you sleep? -Cismigiu. -Shut up! -Cismigiu. -Hotel Cismigiu... You come to do smuggling in Romania, you fucking gipsy! I'll go and check these. They will check our passports... -Wait! Our passports! Hey! -Stop! Guys, look. Good evening, welcome. What can I bring to you? -Food... -What kind? Whatever there is... Meat soup, please. -Sure. -Thank you. -Do you have a cigarette? -Yeah. Did you like the song? Yes. Nice melody. I wanted to sing at the Stadt Oper in Vienna... Can we have our suitcase back? That is not a suitcase. Yes... Can we offer you something in exchange? What are you willing to offer for it? We know what's inside. We can give you its worth in money... You know what's inside? Really? So why did you throw it in that field? I saw what's inside the money you have is not enough. It's just stuff... If you believe... that suitcase contains only "stuff"... maybe you didn't open it. Or... you don't give the right value to what's inside. Do you know how long it has been since I woke up with the smell of coffee? What's inside that suitcase... is just a distant memory for all of us. How much would you pay for a memory? For a dream? A hope? What do you want? You should have asked me this a long time ago. It's too late now. But you... what do you want? For how long... will your holidays last? This is not a market... Thanks. Guys, what is this place? Be quiet, guys. It's here. Hello... Andra? What do you want? Is this Emil's place? What do you want with him? This is from Emil. Who are you? Come in! Sit. Sit down. -Hello. -She's my mother, Costelia. Who are they? They're friends of Emil. Hello! They can't stay. Raluca should come to take her son's jumper. They're friends with dad. Where's dad? Dad couldn't come. Dad couldn't come. ...but he asked us to bring you this. He sent us this. How beautiful it is! A teddy bear! Little gloves... A donkey! Chocolate! Dad... Do you want to see dad? Do you have a... um a... A VHS player? No. Emil. To see Emil. We have a neighbor who has it. Upstairs. How's the situation... outside? Things are changing... fast. I told Emil to wait. Who is top of the Hit Parade? What? Music...who's number one? Toto Cutugno? No, I don't think so... Battiato. -Battiato? -Franco Battiato. Nevermind... -Do you like music? -Yes. I have a surprise for you. Here you go... -Battiato... -For me? Thanks! Genesis, do you know? Thank you! Thank you very much! You're welcome. I'll throw a party tonight. Here. A party? Yes, will you come? You mean a real party? Party! Are you coming? Absolutely! To bring the suitcase to my family... ...you don't have to worry! it's a suitcase with things they can't find there. there's no danger in Romania... once you get there, take a cab to my apartment and don't speak to anyone. all my neighbors work for secret services. if they hear you speaking Italian, it's not good. I'm sorry, I couldn't call you sooner, it's too difficult here. It's too difficult to find a phone? You're making fun of me now? No, it takes forever to be authorized and reach the line. We're not in Budapest, we arrived in Bucharest. We had a little problem with the Police... Hello Silvia, it's me, how are you? Fine, you? I'll be home in a few days... I can feel you're happy. I am. We did a beautiful thing. I'm not kidding, it's not like you imagine... Yeah, whatever. Don't you start... Who the fuck is Alessio? You can't ask me this. I miss you. I miss you... Are you mocking me? Yeah. How dare you? -Bye. -Goodbye. Did you have this on your mind? What are they thinking? Don't know. She walks like my mother, look. Back and forth, in silence. My mother does that all day long, from the kitchen to the living room, in silence. At least your mom smiles. Only when there's a discount on fabric softener. Then my dad arrives at six, we have dinner at eight, sharp. And she goes back and forth all the time, in complete silence. They sit down... they eat... they don't speak to each other. They don't love each other anymore... Maybe they never did. They know it, but they don't do anything, at all... Nobody does anything to change things. They sit and they eat. In silence. It feels like I'm home. Hey, lady! Smile! There's a discount on the fabric softener! I understood a lot here... Three guys in Romania, seems like a perfect cultural trip... How would you know, uh?! You know we met a guy who escaped from Bucharest and couldn't reach his family for months? His wife, his daughter... and he asked for our help to bring a suitcase to them, but it was not easy. People don't have rights. There's the secret Police, phones are bugged, we can't even... Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Silvia! Hello, who's there? It was a joke, it was all a joke! Excuse me. Do you have a cig? -Sorry? -Cigarette. Yes. Thanks, Maurizio. -Bibi... -Yes? Can you lend me some soap? I can't find mine. Did someone take my tapes? -Pago, Pago! -Yes? -Did you take my tapes? -No! They were here. -They must be in your bag. -I never put them there. Is this a joke?! -Hello. -Hi, listen... We had a problem... Yesterday the Police took our passports... and now we don't have any documents. This isn't good... You have to wait while they check them. A man, in front of our hotel, knew his name! You shouldn't worry about it now... Come in! Come! Come here, guys! Thanks for the tapes! Good music! Palinka! What's up? I'm Enrico! Wanna dance? He's really bringing it! You go, Bibi! Here. What's your name? Tortellino! Tortellino and Cappelletto are very different! I feel great! I bet you do. Good evening. Is the party over? Isn't it late to be still out? I was going home. Please... Come, we'll give you a lift. No, thanks, we have a car. I insist. What did you like the most about Romania? I couldn't say... it's all very nice. Do you like the people? Yes. Us Romanians are very... ...welcoming. How long are you planning to stay? -We don't know, but not for long. -Why? Don't you like our country? The girls are very pretty... -We have to go home soon. -Of course... You have to be home at a certain time. Otherwise mom and dad will get mad. You always obey to mom and dad's rules. Every home has its rules. Don't be late. I don't want to see you. -Hi, guys. -Can we come in? Of course. Two men were waiting for us downstairs. -Two men? -Yes. Come with me. We did nothing wrong... maybe some yard sales! Sit down. We saw Emil's apartment, it was completely... Speak slowly, please. The apartment was completely... Upside down! It was a mess! They searched everything. All of this because of a small yard sale? Maybe... it began when you arrived here. But it makes no sense... Emil's family is being constantly surveilled. By national security. We were careful. Maybe you said something on the phone... -No, never. -Phones are surveilled. None of us said suspicious things on the phone. Bibi, you didn't say anything, right? What the fuck did you say? Nothing. Only that we met a guy in Budapest, who escaped from the dictatorship and we helped him to bring a suitcase to his family. You basically said it all! No, I didn't say the address. Are you completely crazy? I screwed up. What will happen to Emil's family? You have to help them. Sraight ahead! What happened to you? You always make the fucking right questions, right? I slipped in the shower, it can happen. -You need a non-slip... -Stop it! What the fuck do you want? We need help. I knew it from the start, you didn't have what it takes, especially him... We put a family in trouble. Two women... and a little girl. Now we don't know what to do. Take them away. How? I can get you some documents. Isn't it dangerous? Another stupid question. Of course it's dangerous! You don't have to worry. You're talking to the best. It'll cost you 1.200 dollars. What the fuck... Just a sec... If you need me I'm here. Shitheads... How much money did we make with the yard sale? It's not about the money, here. -This is no joke. -I know. It's not a joke. They're real people. I screwed up, I'll pay with my money. Fuck it... Let's close it at 800. Bring me three pictures, and the money. They need to look real. What do you think, Sabrina? Will they make it? Sabrina Salerno? These are your new documents. Documents, ok? They don't look Italian. Maybe 'cause they're not? How do you say "name"? Who's Sabrina Salerno? They want to know who Sabrina Salerno is... -A great pussy! -Great pussy... -Moron... -Fuck.. They need to learn some phrases in Italian... "Ciao" means hello. "Buongiorno" means good morning. "Buonanotte" means goodnight. Don't do that. Andrea Riceputi, a pleasure. Little girl is "bambina". And you, altogether... Family. And she is your "mamma". -Good morning. -Good morning. Daniel, thank her for the jumper. Thank you. Can you make me another one? Of course. Goodbye. Goodbye. Where are they? I can't wait to see dad, but we have to come back on Friday for Natalia's party. Mother? Mother? What's up? There. Why not all three? Come on, it's late! -What's happening? -They're not coming. Why? Thank you. This morning I had breakfast with my mother. Adina was happy to eat her dad's chocolate... She was happy. What should I tell her? Should I tell her... everything is better away from here? Away from her friends... from her habits? It was a morning I'll never forget. Tell my husband I can't wait to see him... but not like this. Give it to dad. Wait, wait here. This is all for you, all of it. Take this too, take it! Take this too, take it! Wait, please wait! ...I want also... to address thanks to the initiators and organizers of this great event from Bucharest, considering it as a... Someone is shooting! Come inside! Romania celebrates Christmas with its freedom. Ceaușescu's most loyal allies surrender ...violent but sporadic firefights with the last snipers National security proclaims the victory of the revolution and the democrats. Italy recognizes the government of new Romania. Christmas and the exceptional events of 1989 in this interview with the Pope. Everything seems to be under the control of national security, despite some random shootings. Every strategic area of the country is controlled by the revolution army. Every citizen must deliver their weapons by five o'clock tomorrow. While some members of the secret Police spontaneously surrendered to the army ...the mystery about Ceaușescu remains. Apparently he has been arrested last Friday... Meanwhile the new Government is being officially recognized... ...as the only representation of Romanian citizens. Ceaușescu's fortune has been confined in Switzerland. The estimated worth is about 500 billions. Even if Ceaușescu's regime is not officially over... Romanians are celebrating, in spite of the fightings on the streets aren't over yet. Here comes the first Christmas of freedom. People can feel it in the air, even though Bucharest isn't completely free yet. The last members of the regime struggle to surrender. The urban guerrillas persists, but the snipers won't surrender easily. The mystery about Ceaușescu continues. Announcements about his arrest are posted within the hour. The same about his wife and his son. ...but there is still no visual proof of the facts. His daughter, Zoe, has been arrested. All the pictures are now public. Everyone is waiting for a proof. Seeing Ceaușescu arrested would make the snipers surrender. Islands of resistance are few, but the snipers are very difficult to capture. They hide in the subway's tunnels, then they open fire on crowd. Again, innocent people have died. Let's hope this is the last blood before freedom. Did you picture it like this? This is the third pee stop of our trip. Ladies and gentlemen... My balls are down to my knees! It's him, the world's greatest pee man! They wanted to take our driver's license And you wanted to run away! They caught us right away. It's snowing here. We didn't stop for one second today, Lara. A comment on our first day... First day? Feels like years to me. As you can see we're in a beautiful place. Now we go to the market, a bit of coffee, a bit of gas... He's scared of what he just ate. Look what Pago brought for his next movie... Rat pants, these cost a fortune Lara, just so you know. After having slept in an armchair and not a real mattress... It's cold! We're getting money. Chocolate! An indescribable and unique experience, guys...
