* [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] * * [music] [indistinct greetings] [indistinct greetings] [Man in car] I'll send the car for you later. Maybe you will win some money tonight? Why, do we need it? No, just kidding. Have a good time. Hey, counselor. How goes the legal battle? Oh, justice prevails, Wil. See you later. Teddy, How do I look? Wonderful. Beautiful, sweetheart. You busy later, handsome? I'll be around. -Be around. Be around... -[door bell] Oh, put the food on the side board for me would you love? Don't I always. [mahjong tiles clanking] Of course, if he sells the building we can all expect our rents to go up sky high! -Whoo! -Why don't you buy it yourself? -Ayi, yi, yi! -What, do you know what he is asking? Eleven Hannah? I only have the shop just breaking even. Let me catch my breath, will you? Six. [Hannah] Well, I didn't mean necessarily alone -maybe a limited partnership. -Elsa... [indistinct] Does this mean you're gonna let me play? -[laugh] -I'm not too young. -Yuh! -Ah, ha! Three. -Ah, I'm out. -[indistinct] All right then, who's turn this is? Hannah, Marysia, Sophie, you are playing. Couple of games and this old box will be full. I wonder how much money we have given away after all these years-- Eight hundred dollars for every year we have been playing. -Eight? -Just play ladies! Play, for God's sake, please! -Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! -Play. [television playing] Hi, Ted. Hi Elsa. [ladies talking in other room] [TV announcer] the food's both fresh and clean. Meet owner, Walter Grossman. [Walter] Hello, George. Yes. [TV announcer] Walter, tell us... what would you recommend for the ideal romantic tete a tete? We might begin perhaps, with a lobster salad... [Elsa] Ted, I'm sorry, uh, what are you watching? -What program is this? -[television indistinct] [Ted] I don't know Elsa. Do you want to look it up in the t.v. listings? Here. It's channel, uh, 3. baby vegetables and finally for the grand finale chocolate fondue for two. Ha! Ha! [Television George] Well, there you have it. The air is fresh. The ambiance casual. And it is romantic in a way that is peculiarly Southern California. I highly recommend you'll come here soon. * [music] -[indistinct] -It is a one crack. -[indistinct] -It is a one dot. [Hannah] Five. uh, uh dragon. Four crack... Oh Elsa, could we have the ice bucket over here, like a sweetheart? Oh, me too. Elsa, is something wrong? I just saw Wilheim Gehbert... on the television. A movie, about Birkenau, huh? [Sophie] Ah! Not again. Why can't they just leave us alone? No, it wasn't a movie. What then? It was a show called um... [Elsa] L.A. Report on L.A. And uh, they were reviewing some restaurant and... there he was. [Elsa] He had something to do with the restaurant. Wilheim Gehbert. In Los Angeles? What restaurant? I don't know. I-I did not hear the name. And he was just standing there saying, "Hello, I'm Wilheim Gehbert?" No. The interviewer called him Walter. The Beast of Birkenau is in Los Angeles called Walter? No it was just somebody who looked like him Elsa. -Yeah. -No. It was him. [Elsa] I saw him. And eh, I know it was him. Elsa. How long did you see him on T.V.? [Hannah] Few seconds, yes? Five seconds. I don't know. Five seconds. Ladies, please. Shall we play? [Marysia] No. Wait a minute. Elsa saw something. What if it was him? She's right. What if it really is Gehbert? Right here in L.A.? Haa! So, what if it is? [Gertrude] So, what if it is?! This is the man who raped us! Who did terrible things to us. None of us have ever been able to have children because of the things this man did to us. Maybe we should find out. Just to be sure. What for? He should be reported to the authorities. They should know. Shouldn't they? -But eh, know what? -That a man is living here under an assumed identity. Elsa. Elsa. You saw Wilheim Gehbert for the last time. Thirty years ago. If he is alive, he's not going to look the same. This man has burned himself into our memories because of what he did to us. But it is a memory that is thirty years old. By now it's distorted and twisted and has nothing to do with the present. Yah. [phone rings] Hello. [Elsa on phone] Marysia. I couldn't get it out of mind. Uh, seeing him I mean. [Elsa] Maybe Hannah is right. I don't know. But I called the T.V. station and they told me [Elsa] the name of restaurant is um, Deer Trails. It's in Malibu. Will you uh, go out there with me tomorrow? Yes. I will go with you. [Elsa] Ah, good. Good. Good bye. * [music] Hello. Two for lunch? Yes. Would you like to sit inside or outside? Outside? -Outside. -Follow me. Excuse me. Is Mr. Grossman here today? Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Grossman often doesn't come in until the dinner hour. We saw him last night on the television-- [Waitress] Yes. I guess a lot of people saw that show. Well, enjoy your lunch. Marysia, what should we do now? Eat lunch I guess. It's a long drive. Something from the bar today? Just some mineral water with a twist, please. I would like uh, a glass of white wine, thank you. White wine. What is this? Read it. Do you have Vashem? Are you going to send it? I don't know. I want to find out what happened to Gehbert, but I showed this letter to Gil. And uh, he doesn't want me to send it. He's afraid that it will upset and depress me. But I what think he's afraid that it will upset him. I'll also send a letter to the Simon Wiesanthal Center. They'll know what happened to Gehbert, don't you think? Send it Elsa. Then you will know and you'll feel better. I, I owe Gil so much. You'll understand? [Marysia] Elsa... [Elsa] He's always wanted children so badly. And his family never thought that I was good enough for him. Just some orphan, plucked off the streets of Frankfurt, and uh, damaged goods at that. Oh, Elsa. It's been twenty-five years. What ever debt you have to kill, I think it's paid now. Don't you think so? Yes. Yes. Maybe, but... Lately, things have not been the same between us. You mean in bed? -Yes. -Mineral water and uh, white wine. Enjoy. Maybe these things change. Maybe but it was never good from the start. No. Never. But that was different. It wasn't him. [Marysia] It was me. Such feelings of desire in me are long since dead, Elsa. Maybe because of what happened back then, in the camps, terrible things happened. You never found anyone else? No. No. I don't expect [Marysia] I have no such feelings. [Gehbert] I understand you ladies were asking for me? * [music] We saw you on the television last night. Your place sounded so charming. I hope we don't disappoint you. I'm Walter Grossman. Well, uh, this is Marysia. I'm Elsa Spahn. Marysia. Elsa. Well, I'm glad my brief moment on t.v. attracted such a delightful clientele. Are you looking for a, er, light lunch today? Or something a little more uh, substantial? Oh, uh, avocado and shrimp? Good. Our shrimp are excellent today. Madame? Um, the goat cheese and wild mushroom omelet sounds good to me. That's one of my favorites. Ha! And to drink? Iced tea. I will have the same. If you will allow me, I'd like to provide you with another mineral water and chablis. And I would count this meeting as a great success. Ha ha. Well, thank you. The pleasure is mine. Thank you. * [dramatic music] [Gertrude] I say it's him. [Hannah] How can you say that, Gertrude? If you hadn't been prepared to see Wilheim Gehbert, would you honestly have seen him in that picture? Yes! My God, yes, I know that face. Look at the eyes. I don't know. Those are not the eyes that I remember. [Sophie] Too soft. But you were there. You saw him. What do you say? I say, yes. Elsa says no. Ah. Now you say no? [Elsa] I just don't know now. Seeing him up so close like that, he just doesn't look as much like Gehbert as he did when I saw him on the television. Of course, he doesn't. Because that is not Wilheim Gehbert. Why is it so important to you that it not be him? Because I think it's time for us to stop torturing ourselves about old memories and get on with life. Well, it seems to me, that we just got to find out for sure, that's all. Why can't we let sleeping dogs lie? [Sophie] What is the use? How can you say that? But how can we find out for sure that it is him? There is a way. If we can see him with his shirt off, we can tell. Ah, that scar. On his left shoulder... No, no, it was his right shoulder. No, Marysia. That was his left. Wait, wait, wait. I'm thinking. I'm thinking, uh, uh, Marysia is right. It was his right. Hannah, what do you recall? Do you recall was it his right or his left shoulder? Huh, the man was right-handed. He covered my mouth with his right hand when uh... it was his right shoulder. How can we find out? I'll get him to take his shirt off. Ahh. How could you even think such a thing? You have a better idea? Maybe I can invite him for a barbecue and push him in the pool by mistake. [laughter] No. No. If this is to be done, it must be private. No barbecues. No one must know. This is crazy. -Crazy! -Hmmm, You're telling me, huh. Five Jews sitting around playing a Chinese game that not even the Chinese understand. [laughter] Mmm-mmm. These are a lot better than the dinner I made. I'll tell you that. -[laughter] -Four Jews and a Gentile. Well, by birth maybe, but a Jew by osmosis! [laughter] -[Max Langbein] Bye dear. -Goodbye. Goodbye. Have a good time. [Max Langbein] You too. [door closes] So? I will do it. There is no one in my life that can be hurt by this. Marysia, you are serious about this? It shouldn't be too difficult. We all know how he loves the ladies. * [music] * [music] [car door closing] [laughter] * [piano playing] Is Dr. Harrington here yet? -Harrington for two? -Yes. No. Dr. Harrington hasn't arrived yet. Would you like to be seated? Or would you like to wait at the bar? I will wait at the bar. Would you tell Dr. Harrington when he comes, please. Certainly. -[laughter] -* [piano music] Scotch and water, please. Excuse me a moment. Good evening. Oh... Marysia, isn't it? You have a very good memory. I remember what is important to me. I'm so pleased you have come back here again so soon. You approve? My friend and I, uh, we wanted something a little private and I remembered your place. Ah, you're waiting for someone? I see. I'm a bit concerned. He's usually very prompt. And I was fifteen minutes late. I'm certain he will be here, unless he is very foolish. I think I will telephone him, excuse me. Oh wait, be my guest. Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Charlie, let me have two martinis with a twist. [phone rings] [answering machine] This is La Boutique. We are open 10-6. Monday through Saturday. You may leave a brief message after the beep. [beep] uh, Is Dr. Harrington there, please? Oh. Do you know if he is going to Malibu? Oh. Oh. I see. Well uh, thank you very much. -Got bad news? I hope not. -Oh, he was called to the hospital. Oh. A medical man. A doctor's life belongs to his patients, they say. Well, it's up to us to make certain that this trip of yours is not wasted. Will you be my guest for dinner, please? Oh. You are very kind. I'll take full responsibility for the menu. Seat. Well, you enjoy. Perhaps, you can join me. I don't see how you keep me away. Because, this is my place. [nervous laughter] Bottle of wine? [Behgert] France, blanc de blanc. Two glasses, please. * [music] Beautiful evening. [clink of glasses] You are not very far from the beach. No. Not far. Let's go for a swim. Ha ha ha. We are not that close. But the beach would be very deserted. [snorts] The water is very cold this time of year. [Gehbert] Perhaps in the morning, when the sun is shining. You're doing that again. Huh, what am I doing? Ha! You're staring at me. Oh, no. I was just trying to place the accent. Ah, Cologne. You're not German, are you? I'm Polish. [Polish dialect] So... Were you in the war? Oh, yes. Very much so. If you consider being bombed by your own country being in the war. My family, fortunately, was very well off. And when the trouble began, we fled. First to Belgium, then to England. I was educated there. You are Jewish? My father was Jewish. You? Me? [laughs] Excuse me. You were just a child. How could you remember the war? Yes, I was young. I was very young. It's all right. I don't want to know about it. [laughs] That's a lie. I want to know everything about you. [Gehbert] I don't want to frighten you away. I just wish, you could be here, like this for a long, long, time. This man you were waiting is very important to you? Oh, You've been so kind. I feel I... I feel you're entitled to know, I'm married. Yes. I know. My husband is very much older than I. And um... our relationship is one of respect and companionship. And he's uh, rather feeble. So you see the man meant-- I understand. I just want to know if there's room for me in your life. Ha! You've only just met me. It doesn't feel that way does it. Marysia... I want to know you for a long, long time. I can't tell you how long it's been since I felt this way. Don't you feel it too? Surely what I sense I feel from you, can't be entirely wrong. Oh... I feel it too. * [music] Ahh! Ahh! [crying] What is it? Are you alright? -Please, we don't have to talk, do we? -* [music] Marysia? What's the matter? I've never been so happy. [squawking bird] What is that? It's just Hines! I keep him in the kitchen so he won't create mischief. You want to see him? Hmmm? [squawking] Hines, Was ist los? Was ist los, Hines? [squawking] [laughter] * [music] [squawking] I say, "Hines, What's happening?" He says, "My cold-blooded doctor." [laughs] Ahhh! Doctor? My father was a doctor. This was his bird. They live to over a hundred you know. [squawking] Danke. Herr Doctor. * [piano music] [crying] Wie heibt du? Marysia. Herr Doctor. [squawking] * [music] [crying] [screeching tires] [gagging] [answering machine] Marysia, this is Walter. I was expecting you to call today. When you get this message, call me at the restaurant. I will be there all evening. I miss you Marysia. [Beep] This is Walter, Marysia. Call me when you get this message. It's important that I talk to you. -[Beep] -Marysia. The letter from Yad Vashem came Saturday morning. And the one from Wiesenthal, just before I called you. Yad Vashem can only record. Uh huh. And Wiesenthal doesn't take cases already adjudicated. [sigh] It would take entirely new evidence. New witnesses. After all these years, where would you find them? Yeah. Yeah. [Hannah] So, you see. It's over. There is nothing more we can do. Nothing is over. For participation in 5,450 murders! Four years imprisonment. [Marysia] 18 months served with Treas... [indistinct] What does that mean? Term is not explained. The term is not explained! It's nothing! Nothing! Marysia. Right or wrong, in the eyes of the law. He has paid his debt to society. What about his debt to me? To us? Is he allowed to go on? Is there no finish to it? I know. I know! I know my dear friend, please. We must forget about this. Forget about it? * [music] [knock at door] [Banging on door] [Male voice] Marysia! [knocking] Who is it? It's Walter, Marysia. Will you let me in? Walter. How did you find me? [Banging on door] You're going let me... stand out here yelling through a door? Marysia Please... let me in. Open the door. No. No. This is not good. [Marysia] We can not go on. This is too, too difficult. [Gehbert] Marysia, just give me the courtesy of talking to me about it. -[banging on door] -Marysia, open the door! [banging on the door] [knocking] I found you. How did you find me? Hmm. First time you came to the Deer Trail with your friend, you used your business credit card. I checked on the address. Here I am. You have a vase? Walter, uh, this is not possible. This can not go on. It has to end right now. You said that, yes... [Marysia] To go on it would just create a problem. Something important happened the other night. It happened to you too. Don't deny it. I felt it. We can't just throw that away. Yes. But you see, I'm a married woman-- Yes, and I don't want to hear this. We can conduct ourselves in such a way that no one need know. I know you hesitate because of your sense of duty and I know you want this as much as I do. You're entitled to this small measure of happiness and so am I. We don't want to hurt anyone. We won't. I'm going to kiss your eyes. * [music] Beautiful eyes. What is it? I just uh, I just, the keys to the bathroom. I need a moment to get ready. Excuse me. * [music] [phone dialing] [phone rings] I will get it. La Boutique. Oh. Yes. I see. I will be right there. I'm very sorry but I must go. It was my husband. He's having an emphysema attack and, uh, sometimes they can be very bad. Is there medication or a nebulizer Oh, yes. Yes. Of course. But he needs me. Please, I must go. When will I see you again? Uh, I will call you. [singing in Hebrew] Thank you Cantor Harben. [Lady speaker] Welcome, members, and friends... of the 38 Club. Welcome. [Sophie] Where were you? He came to the shop! Gehbert! He wants to see me! He's very insistent! On the ninth of November, 1938, the streets of Germany and Austria, resounded with the sound of breaking glass. As windows of thousands and thousands of Jewish shops and synagogues were smashed. Leaving behind them what has been described as rivers of broken glass. Kristallnacht. The Night of Broken Glass. The beginning of the horror. But more than Jews were victims. Millions of Catholics, Protestants, and Gypsies followed us to the camps. We witnessed... countless murders and obscenities. We are the survivors. And our memories of the Kristallnact, remains as sharp as the shards of breaking glass that blanketed the streets on that infamous night! Now, is another time. A better time. But we remember. And each year, one of you is chosen to memorialize that event. Sophie Langbein. [whispers] -Yes, dear. Go on. -No! No! No, I don't want to do it. Go! Go! Go! * [music] [Boom] [Boom] [Boom] [Crowd] Never again. Never again. Never again. Never again. Never again. Never again. Never again. Nine... Seven. Six... Noooo!!!! I say no! -[Hannah] Gertrude! -I figured it out. That degenerate served one day for every three murders! One day! I wonder how did he get in this country? Who was it that allowed him in? We did. We allowed him in. What difference does it make? There is nothing we can do. [Hannah] So let's stop beating our heads against the wall. There is something we can do. Ladies, I don't think this merits any further discussion. We can kill the bastard. Of course, we would all like to punish him somehow. I didn't say punish him somehow. I said kill him. [Gertrude] All right. If nobody else is up for it, I will do it. Gertrude, there's no sense-- Let's drop the subject. We don't have to discuss it anymore. I know what I have to do. That's all. Hitman! I think we should call it a night. We are all playing miserably anyway. So next time when we have cooled off, we can put this behind us. I don't think we should uh, leave just now. Marysia... I don't think this kind of talk will do any good for any of us. Oh but I think Gertrude is serious and I don't think we should be leaving right now. Gertrude is serious, now. But eventually, she will realize what something like this could do to her life, to Ted and your marriage! It won't do anything. I'll do it right. You really mean it? You bet your sweet life, I really mean it. [Sophie] Well, I don't think we can let you do that. You can't stop me. No, what I mean is we can't allow you to, um, take on all that by yourself. [Sophie] If you are going to do it, then we should all... do it. Sophie! What in God's name are you talking about?! Hannah, be honest, we all want Gehbert dead. Gertrude is just willing to do our job for us. Our job? Since when is it our job to kill?! [Hannah] To murder?! That's Gehbert's job not ours! Then let's see that he gets paid for his job. -Gert-- -I say we do it the way they did it in the camp. I say we draw lots. [Sophie] That way it will be our secret, no one will know who drew the swastika and no single one of us will be responsible. We will all be responsible. This is madness. I'm leaving. I, I cannot believe this. Do you people realize what it is you are saying here? There's no need for this! I'm the best one for it. I'll do it. I don't know why you are making it so complicated. No. Sophie is right. If this thing is to be done, we must all do it. Equal responsibility. Elsa? I don't... Elsa, come with me. They will come to their senses... on their own. Come with me. Yeah. Maybe you should go. You have much to lose. No. I will stay. This is, Sophie! I don't believe what I'm seeing. -What has gotten into you? -I don't think the law is always right. [Sophie] In fact, I think this is a chance, to put things right, for a change. I, I don't mind doing something like that. Am I the only one then, that hasn't gone crazy? Am I the only one that understands... the monstrous thing you are talking about! [Hannah] Well, if I thought you would really do it, I would call the police and tell them. I really would. [door slams] * [music] [Gertrude] [indistinct] I know how to do it too. * [music] One thing. We must not speak of this again. When it happens, if it happens. -Then, we read it in the papers. -[Sophie] Yeah. And if the one who drew the swastika changes her mind and doesn't do it for some reason, then, that will also be the end of it. Yeah? We never mention it again. [Sophie] And that way, no one is to blame... and uh, no one has to feel, guilty. Yeah, that sounds fine to me. Yeah. It's good. I'm not worried. [whispers] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. * [music] [restaurant noise] Who is it? [phone] It's Marysia. Ah. I knew you would call. [night sounds] [thud] [thud] Walter? [car engine] Darling, Ha! Ha! Ha! Forgive me. I tried to call you. We had a fire at the restaurant. -[Marysia] Oh. -The kitchen. Nothing serious. But I had to close up and send everyone home. -Are you all right? -[Gehbert] I'm just a little soiled. I hope you have not been waiting long. I tried to call you. Anyway, you see, I couldn't very well bring back anything from the restaurant for our dinner. I'm so glad you are here. Let's go to Malibu. Couple of nice places there for dinner. Oh. Couldn't we just stay here and eat something? You must have something in the 'fridge. [Gehbert] Nothing. Not a thing. Some eggs? I want to take you out. I want to show you off. Oh. Yes. I know that but, um... I don't like hiding you from the world. [Marysia] I understand. But I don't think-- It's your husband... I'm growing weary about the story of the invalid husband! What do you mean story? I called your phone this evening, twice. The phone rang, rang, rang and no one answered. If your husband's so sick he can't go out, why doesn't he answer? He very often doesn't answer. I told you. He is very feeble. If he's so feeble, why doesn't someone stay with him? It's very difficult to explain to someone who has never cared for an older person that... There are degrees, you see... Degrees of feebleness? [Marysia] You could say that. Yeah. I see. -Why are you lying to me. -[Marysia] Ugh! I'm not lying to you. All right. When you first came out to the Deer Trails with your woman friend, you were not wearing a wedding ring. When I meet a beautiful woman, I check things like that. And yet, you were wearing the ring, the night you were to meet your gentleman friend, Dr. Harrington. I just find this odd. It's the opposite that you would expect from an intelligent woman anxious to avoid compromising herself in public. I'm not so expert in these things. Heh, it's not my everyday behavior. [laughs] That's right. I'm sorry. Hey? What's in here? Huh? -It's for the shop. -What, this? Huh? I have been robbed once. I have license for it. [Marysia] I was robbed once. Yeah. I'm sure. [sliding door slams] What do you expect to do with this little thing? This is what you need. Here. This is yours. 7.65 mm, that is, if you are interested in protecting yourself. It's reasonable that this one will stop someone with the first shot and light enough for the purse Now it's ready. You know how to use this weapon? They are all the same, no? Is a spinach the same as a grand piano? Safety off. [Gehbert] I say... why don't you fire? -Go ahead. -* [music] Now is your chance. It's what you came here for isn't it. -It's why I came here. -[Gehbert] To kill me. To kill you. Murderer! -[Gehbert] Well go ahead, then. -Butcher! Go ahead! [Gehbert] Go on. Do it! [Marysia] I can't You're not going to make me as bad as you! -That's it! 'cause you're a coward! -Murderer! -No! No! Butcher! -Which one of my girls are you? Which one? Tell me. I remember all of you. -Ahh! -[gunfire] -[squawking bird] -[Marysia] Ahhh! [crying] Look at you. You wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for me. [Gehbert] If I had to do it again, I would do exactly the same but this time, I would be more thorough! Less a pawn of my own foolish compassion. God! Ugh!! Uh, uh, -Ugh!!! -[squawking bird] [crying] -[Marysia] Ahhh! -[Gehbert] Argh!!! -[crying] -* [music] [car engine] -[squawking] -* [music] -[crying] -[whispering] [television playing] -Can you be a little late to class? -Oh, please I'm already a little late. You got me all interested this morning and then off to the shower. Because it was 8:30, I thought it was 7:30. -It is all your fault. -Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not that good anyway. I'll be the judge of that. -Who are you comparing me to? Hmmm? -No one. I've had a few others but uh, you're the best. You got me didn't you? I sure did. And I'm sorry I must tear myself away because I have a meeting at 4:00 and I'll be back at 6:30. Okay. Okay, professor, you go to school and leave me here all by myself. [Television Reporter] residents are requested to take alternate routes where possible and to allow ample time for delays... and now for an update on the killing of restauranteur, Walter Grossman who was found shot in his Malibu home a few days ago. With no apparent motive, police are now speculating that a love quarrel may have been the blame. The investigation, of course, will continue. -We'll be right back after these messages. -Oh my God! It's done. We did it. It's over with. And that's that. [doorbell rings] Elsa? You are expecting someone? Gil is away isn't he? Good evening, Stella. They are in there? -Good evening. -[Elsa] Hannah. We weren't really expecting to see you again. [Hannah] Why not? It's Wednesday night. You want to play? Yes. When I saw Saturday's papers, I thought, my God, they have gone and done it. [Hannah] They have really gone and done it. Please, forgive me. I should have known my friends better. What are you saying? Well, now that I know you had nothing to do with Gehbert's death, I feel like a complete idiot. What are you talking about? [sighs] Well, it's probably on the news by now. I heard about at the court house this afternoon. They have picked up the man that killed Gehbert. * [music] The police theory is that he broke into Gehbert's house, and apparently the killing occurred when Gehbert confronted him. After which, he had an accident in his car, a pretty bad one. And when the sheriff arrived, this man claimed that he lost his memory, even though they found a map in his car with Gehbert's neighbor circled and marked, WG. So do they know who this person is? Martin Renner. Name ring a bell? No. I've never heard that name before. Name's probably fake. His driver's license was. [Elsa] Why did it uh, take them so long to come forward with this man. They found Gehbert's body a day later. I guess they just didn't put it all together, until now. Ladies, it's that time again. What do you mean, Gertrude? We have to find out if this, Renner could have done our job for us. -[Elsa] How do we do that? -[Hannah] What are you talking about? That night at Marysia's house, we agreed to do it. As far as I know, we did do it. If you didn't do it, write a zero.If you did do it, write an X. -Anybody need a pencil? -[Sophie] Yah, Yes! I do. I, I can't believe it. Of course, this man did it. My friends are not murderers. My God! How long have we known each other? Elsa. Shh! Shh! Shh! Silly... -Silly? -Here. You look at them. Gertrude, they have the killer. Look at them. Zero. Zero. Zero. X? * [music] What are, are we going to do about this? Yes. We have to do something. What is there to do? Who is this man? What difference does it make? He's innocent. We can't just stand by and watch an innocent man go to prison, or worse. Wait a minute, Wait! [indistinct] We don't know what kind of case the D.A. office has against him. So? It may never to to trial. We must wait and see what happens at the preliminary hearing. Wait? Hannah. I thought you were going to call the police. How can I? I don't know which one of you did it. [Prosecutor] If the defendant's amnesia prevents him from remembering that he killed Walter Grossman. Then it also prevents him from remembering that he didn't kill Walter Grossman. And the evidence presented here today clearly indicates that he is guilty. That's all I have. Mr. Renner, I am ordering you be bound over to the Superior Court, eight weeks from today without bail. [Judge] Next case. * [music] I have an idea of what we can do. If anybody is interested. Sure. Uh, huh. Who ever killed him, will write a confession -Oh, no! -[indistinct talk at once] Wait. Please. Please hear me out. The killing. How it was done. Everything. Will be outlined in detail. Then copy's of the confession will be mailed to all of us including the writer herself. We will then all memorize it. We will all five of us know, down to the tiniest detail how Wilheim Gehbert was killed. Five? What? You said five. Yeah. -You said all five of us will know. -Mm hmm. Does that mean that, eh, you, you... When I read the paper, and realized he had been murdered, the lawyer in me had been appalled. But a little girl, shivering in a white room in Birkenau prison camp wept tears of joy. Knowing Wilheim Gehbert had been killed. [crying] Uh-hum. [sniffing] Shall I go on? Which we must. After we have all memorized every detail, of the killing. We will then, meet again. Make sure the confessions are exactly the same. [typing] * [music] [Sophie] She went to bed with him. [Hannah] No, Sophie. You went to bed with him. I went to bed with him. We have to start thinking about it that way. Everything in this letter. We all did it. All of it! I knew that Grossman was Gehbert. Contact with him touched off feelings of desire that I had assumed were long since dead. Which I came to realize gave me a sexual power over him. A power which I employed by refusing his req-requests... for another assignation, until the night I went to his house in Malibu to kill him. feelings of desire that I had assumed were long since dead. -[Hannah] So. Everyone has memorized it, yeah? -[Gertrude] Yeah! Now we destroy all the copies. Now is the time we go public. [Hannah] This is when your husbands will have to know. It will be difficult. We should tell them together. [Sophie] We did it together and we should tell them together. Gertrude? Oh. Yeah. I was just thinking about Teddy. How he will take it... Hell, he'll be fine! Will they understand? Uh, Do you think? I wonder? It will be easier together. Yeah. But, um, who will begin? I mean, who will tell about s-s-sleeping with him? I will Elsa. -I'll start. -No. Hannah, you can't. You must stay out of this. You are a lawyer, and you will have to help us. Even with the husbands? Yes. I think so. [Gertrude] Marysia, is right. Sophie? Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. I will help you explain it to them. Yeah. We'll do it. [Hannah] We have to tell you the real story of what happened to Wilheim Gehbert. You have seen in the news that he was murdered by a man named Renner who was trying to break into his house. We know this is not true. The reason we know is because we, that is Elsa, Sophie, Marysia, and Gertrude murdered Wilheim Gehbert. What? I conspired with my friends here but I did not actually participate. I will assist in defending them in court. [Max Langbein] What! Court? What are you talking about? Max. Max. So, uh, what happens now? Well, I'm not sure. You go to the police? Yes, I will give them my confession, and, eh, and they will let Renner go. Your confession. Never in a million could I guess this could happen. And the others, they'll go too? I'm not going to ask you if you did it. If you were the one who killed him, he was human garbage, remember that. When people tell you differently, don't listen. Garbage! You got guts, Sophie. You've got guts. Teddy. [knocks on door] Teddy! Don't shut me out! Please, Teddy open the door! Please talk to me! Just tell me, that you didn't do it! You all confessed. You didn't all sleep with him. I had to sleep with him Teddy. It was the only way I could do it. You couldn't find another way! The man is dead. I executed Dr. Wilheim Gehbert. The Beast of Birkenau. -That's what's important! -[Teddy] No! It's how you did it! That's what important! You're a whore! Everything you ever wanted in your life, you used your body to get it. -Including me! -[Gertrude] Oh, yeah! I don't remember a complaint until now. You were a bookworm when I met you, Teddy, pottering around with your dissertation. And now look at you, you're an associate professor. Why? Because I made you, Teddy. -This whore made you. -That's enough! Where are you going? Your mother's? Yes, for now! You know what it is, Teddy? You have no courage! I'm too much woman for you! I always have been! -Go! -[door slams] Go on! Get out! Get out! I don't need you! And don't bother to come back! [door slams] Teddy. Oh. Teddy. You expect me to believe this? That Walter Grossman was really Wilheim Gehbert. And you lured him to bed and killed him?! It's true. No. El, it is not true! Maybe one of you killed him. Maybe. But it wasn't you! I killed him. He deserved to die. The police have the man who killed him. He's the wrong man. I cannot let him suffer for what we did. But it's all right if I suffer? Is that it? Yes. You will suffer and I will suffer. We will all have to pay for this. But Wilheim Gehbert is dead. He deserved to die and we killed him. That's all. [Prosecutor] Thank you, Lisa. You want to check this over? If it is all right. Oh, uh, it was 8:35 when I arrived Gehbert's house not 8:45. Now that's not really substantive. We can change that. -Is that all? -Umm... -Yes. That seems to be all. -[Prosecutor] Thank you. You know, I keep asking myself why are you doing this? -You don't believe me? -Oh, no. Sure. I believe you. You have one of the best motives I have ever come across. And you mentioned his washing. Police report mentioned there was still a strong scent of soap on Gehbert's hands and face. Yes, um... Sandalwood. Hmmm. So you said. [Prosecutor] Well we can check that out too. Mrs. Langbein, I want you to know that I have a job to do and I take that job very seriously. And one of the rules I work under is that murder is the ultimate crime, no matter who the victim is. Yes. I know. So maybe on a.... on a personal level I should have sympathy with you. But on a professional level, I still have my job to do. You understand what I am saying? I don't expect any special treatment, Mr., uh, Ferraro. Good. 'Cuz you're not gonna get it. I can't afford it. Now, have you ever been in jail before? Um, sorry. That was a stupid question. Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to go to jail again. [buzzing intercom] I'll let you know if I find out anything new. [Prosecutor] Sanders, will you find a cell for Mrs. Langbein, please. I'm going now. If you do this, if you walk into the police station and tell the world you murdered Wilheim Gehbert, it'll destroy our lives, Ellie. -Now you said that Sophie went. -Yes. And I can not let her be in the jail alone. I cannot. When the media gets a hold of this, it will destroy my business. Don't you care about that? Oh, yes. But this is something that I have to do. I have to. Everything. Everything that I have worked for. For us. It will all be gone. Oh I can't believe this is happening. Why didn't you say something to me? I could have helped. You've always come to me before with everything. But this, no. You choose to ignore me. Ellie, can't you understand that this could destroy my life, my business... I'm doing this for me. I do this for me. My friends are counting on me. I love you... but I have to do this. Who are you? I don't even know you anymore. You're not my Ellie. Maybe. Maybe, I think... I'm not the same girl you brought home from Germany 25 years ago. But, I still love you. Then don't do this. I, I, what can I do? What can I do to make you understand? What? I'm begging you, Ellie. Don't do it! I have to go. I have to go. I won't be here. If you come back, I won't be here. I killed Wilheim Gehbert. What about your friend Sophie Langbein? I killed him. Heh. Well, somebody killed him, that's for sure. But I'd like to know why I have two confessions. Is there something that I could sign? Mrs. Spahn, why don't we save the taxpayers' time and money. Okay? What are you doing here? I killed him and I'm here to give you my confession. [typewriter] Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm Gertrude Simon and I would like to see Mr. Ferraro, please. He's busy right now. What's this about? I have information he'll want about the Wilheim Gehbert murder. You believe me don't you? Believe you? I believe you had something to do with it. Along with your friends, Mrs. Spahn and Mrs. Langbein. I got confessions coming in here every 15 minutes. I believe you. Then you'll let Renner go? Oh sure. We got plenty of killers. Lady... I'm holding you and both your friends on a conspiracy charge until I find out what the hell is going on around here! -[cell door clanks open] -[Officer] Okay, Renner let's go. [Officer] Your lucky day. Come on. * [music] Free Sophie and free Gertrude! [Crowd] Free Elsa! Free Sophie! Free Gertrude... * [music] The accused will rise. Sophie Langbein. Elsa Spahn. Gertrude Simon. I'm ordering to be bound over to the Superior Court, on the 18th of this month, on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder, Section 182 of the state penal code. -[gavel pound] -[Officer] Court is adjourned. Please rise. [court murmurings] -Let's go ladies. -[Max] It's okay. It's okay. Ma'am, please. -Let's go ladies. -[Max] You will be all right. Mr. Ferraro... Yes. I'm the one you are really looking for. My friends are innocent. I'm the one who really killed Wilheim Gehbert. -[knock] -[Alton] Come in. [Alton] Sid. Polygraph report. [Alton] And? What it boils down to is that they are all telling the truth or they are all lying. Take your pick. This is turning into a circus. Have you read this? I don't read the papers. [Alton] Yeah? Well I do. And so does the police commissioner, the ACLU and everybody else. [Alton] And we look like a bunch of incompetent bozos persecuting four harmless ladies who struck a blow for humanity. Hey! What are you saying? Sid, face it. No jury on Earth's going to convict them. What the jury does is their business. My business is building a case. -[buzzing] -Yep. -[telephone] Mr. Ferraro? -He's here. You. Yeah. [telephone] Mr. Ferraro? Yes. This is Hannah Epstein. I'm an attorney. I think we may have met. -Uh huh. -I'm here at the 38 Club on Wilshire Blvd. Do you know where that is? Yes, I do. Well I think it would be worth your while to stop by here in the next hour or so. The four women you have in custody for the Gehbert killing are members here. Is that so? Yes. That's right. And um, I have some information that may be useful to you. -[knock] -Excuse me. -[secretary] Oh. Mr. Ferraro. -Ms. Epstein? No, she is at the auditorium. Please, come with me. Mr. Ferraro. -Ms. Epstein. -Yes. I'm glad you could come. Ladies, this is Mr. Ferraro. He is the assistant District Attorney who is prosecuting the case against Sophie, Elsa, Marysia and Gertrude. And I'm sure he can use our help in determining who actually killed Wilheim Gehbert. Ladies, who did kill Wilheim Gehbert? * [music] I don't care if there are 600 of 'em. I will investigate them all. One of them is a killer. [Alton] Ah, but which one, huh? Huh? You'll never find out. You know why? Because they all killed Gehbert. [Alton] All of them together as one. How many people are you prepared to prosecute? -As many as I have to. -Oh come on, Sid! What's bothering you? That the ladies got the better of you? We can't let them go. A murder has been committed here. Of course we can't let them go. We can release them for lack of evidence while we continue the investigation. Lack of evidence! I got four signed confessions here. Correction my friend, a hundred and fifty-four. Is that what you want? -That's what I want. -That's an order. Yeah. And if you don't do it, I'll do it myself. [applause] Coming through. Coming through! Let me through! Let me through! -[laughing] -Ohh, how are you! -[laughing] -Ohh, how are you! * [music] Missed me? Love me? You really had me worried. Elsa, he's not coming. He called said he's going to be away for awhile, and eh, and he wants the best for you. He says you should, eh, stay in the house until it's sold... I'm sorry. What do you plan to do now, Mrs. Walenka? Huh, what do I plan to do now? Forget. Forget. [Hannah] Sophie, it's your turn. [Sophie] I, I, don't know. I have nothing. Uh! I'm out! This is our fourth game without a Mahjong. Let's take a break. Are you okay? Yes. I think so. I just signed up for uh, two classes at UCLA. Poetry? No. Philosophy of Law and Introduction to Legal Ethics. Whoo! Whoo! -Elsa, you may wind up in law school. -Maybe. Girls... I'm tired. I'm going to go home. Gert. It's over isn't it? Just isn't the same anymore. That's it then. [Hannah] After all these years? [doorbell rings] -Who's that? -I have no idea. Mr. Ferraro has come to pay us a visit. This is not exactly a social call. Well then perhaps I should be asking you for a search warrant. No. No. No. There are some things I want to show you. Things that were sent to me. May I come in. Yes. Please do. What is it? I think this belongs to one of you ladies here. I also have a tape I want you to listen to. It came in the same package. It's from Martin Renner. He sent it to me, but I think it's really for you. [tape recorder] My real name is not Martin Renner. I am far away now and you will never find me. I'm sending this tape because I want to ease the minds of the women who saved my life. It's the least I can do. Our lives have been inextricably linked. Through you, I have fulfilled my life and I am eternally grateful. My story starts when I was eight-years-old. My parents were in the German Underground. I am not Jewish, but I saw my father murdered and my mother raped before my eyes by Wilheim Gehbert. It was my life's work to find him. One day I am inquiring about Gehbert, at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Vienna, when you letter about him arrived. So finally I find him, in Los Angeles. I had already parked my car and had broken into Gehberts' house on the night you arrived Mrs. Walenka. Then, Gehbert came, I concealed myself. Hid out on the terrace. I was witness to the whole scene. I saw you lose the courage to shot him. I saw him discover your gun and throw it away. I saw him give you his gun and pretend to instruct you. And then reveal himself. I saw you struggle for the gun. I saw Gehbert fall. I saw you smother him and then leave. Stopping long enough to get your gun from the bushes. When I came close to him, he started to move. I realized he wasn't dead, so I finished the job. I picked up the same pillow you had used and smothered him 'til he was gone. The rest you know. One thing before I go, as far as I'm concerned. You planned it. And you are all guilty. Attempted murder. Murder. It's all the same to me. Good night, ladies. [crying] You don't have to live with it anymore. I just wish I hadn't heard about it like that. Up until now it's been like a kind of dream. A dream of our own making. But just now hearing Renner describe it like that, all at once, I realized that we killed a man. Not a man. A thing. A beast. Damn him. He's not dead. -* [music] -Look at us. He has scarred us forever. For what he did to us and what we've done to him. [crying] [Hanna] Sophie. Where are you going? Oh. I- I just thought that I would go to the temple. Oh. Can I come with you? Marysia, you are Catholic. I don't think God will mind. What about the game? I think the game is over. * [music] * [somber music] * [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] *
