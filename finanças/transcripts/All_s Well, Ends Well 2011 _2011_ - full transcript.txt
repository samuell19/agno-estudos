Hurry up... Hurry up... The Empress Dowager is critical... Hurry up... Hurry up... Hurry up... You're too slow It's worth to practice over 20 years! Now, I can make good use of it. Your Majesty, what're you doing? Let's not waste time! The stance of "Quick Steps"! Finished! Are you kidding? Luckily I am still faster than you guys. Did you call a taxi? How could you come so fast? What stance did you use? Your Majesty, I always walk after meals. Okay, from now on, I won't let you eat, so you can't practice anymore. Queen Mother! Please don't die! Queen Mother... Queen Mother! Didn't you say my Queen Mother was critical? She is just asleep. She cried for a terribly headache, she said she'd like to die. I helped to massage her acupuncture points of Bai Hui Xue, Tai Yang Xue and Shang Xing Xue. She felt so comfortable and then fell asleep. Oh! Who is here shouting? Empress Dowager. Queen Mother, your son Ocean is here to meet you. Who is he? His Majesty is the emperor. Queen Mother, I am your son, Ocean. Ocean... Oh, I want Pearl! I want Pearl! Where is Pearl? Come here Your Majesty, what's the matter? How many times has my Queen Mother asked this question to me in this month? According to my calculation, the total sum is 365. Not many, huh? Not many at all... Queen Mother, Pearl has been sent to Central China for studies since she was young. Pearl... Doctor, what's up with her? My Queen Mother seems to have Narcolepsy. And her sickness is getting more and more serious, is that curable? Your Majesty, since your King Father died, she got different kinds of sickness because of depression. Sometimes, she has mental disorder. It's really hard to cure all the diseases at one time. What are you talking about? I asked again, is that curable? Sure, sure, I felt her pulse this morning, I found that her pulse went smooth. From my experience, I am sure that it is... It senses pregnancy. What? She is a granny! Did you, did you... Your Majesty, it's none of my business. Your mother wishes baby coming, it reveals in her pulse movement. See! Queen Mother is great! She still wants to have a baby! Not exactly, she may want to have grandson or grand-daughter. Actually, it's easy to cure her sickness. Let's have something to celebrate Sure! My sister Pearl will come home some days later. When she sees Pearl, she will be so happy. Yes, she will be very happy to see the princess. Happy The lovers are going to be apart. The heartless wave... Wet the lovers! The boat is leaving. The lovers will be apart. The bird flies to the South. The bird flies back home. When will the birds fly together again? I am lonely, I am so sad. I am so lonely! General Bing... You sing really great! Princess Pearl, I promise, I will never sing to other girls. Really? People who drunk will never tell lies. I just love you because of your honesty. General, We have reached the Kingdom of Hua-tien earlier than expected. It's sad to be apart, but we must make it earlier than expected! Poor us! Bing, I'll tell my King Brother our affair. He loves me so much, he sure will marry me to you. It sounds nice to name me General, But actually... I am just a bodyguard. I am no match for you. I don't want you to despise yourself. General... Yes I found a body floating in the water. Let it be. But that is a female. Bing, you sing well, and you can dance well too! It's not dancing, it's Kung-fu. Got it. Don't let her freeze to death. What are you doing? Are you taking her advantage? Not yet. Step back. Let me do it. I got a First-aid license some years ago. Okay... Wake up... Wake up! Pearl, you are great! Mister Wu... I think she must have a broken heart. When can lovers have happy ending? Damn it! How come an ugly guy like you dares to flirt around like this? When they enter the village, let's go rob them! Got it. General, we have arrived some hours earlier. I think we still have to wait for a long time. Now we are searching a place for rest. The woman we saved is still sleeping, should we take care of it? I told you, other than protecting the princess, I will not take care of any other females. What's the matter? Something is wrong! Be careful! Be careful! General, actually, what should we take care of? I got shot! It's just a pen. They are the notorious So Mary and her pirates! Protect the princess! Protect the princess! You're correct I am the Mary, the notorious bandit Go robbing! Your Highness, run! Don't be afraid, I'll protect you! I am good at fighting! It's all right, Your Highness. Your Highness Your Highness, please wait, I am going to report to the General General... Princess Pearl fell into the sea. Where did she fall? She jumped from this place. Just now here Got it... You silly girl, I told you to marry a rich guy only. I didn't ask you to jump to death. Why did you jump to death? Pal, thank you Give me But she is not my daughter! My daughter is of 6 feet tall. She is only five feet and something. Go get the body again! Do you think it's fishing? My girl, I have got nothing now, Let me jump to death and meet you in heaven too. Are you okay? It hurts! Did you jump or were you pushed into the water? I don't know. Let me send you home. I don't know. What's your name? I don't know... So, how can I help you? I am hungry! Me too. But I paid all my money to the guys who saved you from the sea. My poor daughter... I am hungry! My daughter... Yes, pre-birth arranged marriage, they haven't met my daughter before. Why not give you an advantage... Come on! Since you know nothing about yourself, let me tell you... I am your dad. Dad. Good girl! You're my daughter Nightingale. Nightingale! Correct. Now, I am taking you to your new family, okay? Okay! Being affectionate is a pain. Lovesickness is endless to explain. I will wait and see how you reply! You and a cat do want to understand the taste of fish, The fragrance of first love was found back by us. What does that mean? But it's too profound to understand! Good! Love comes easy, goes easy... Actually, what is it about lately? Miss... What's the matter? A gentleman and his daughter are here to meet the master. My brother is not home, let them go. But they refuse to go. He wants you to meet him instead. Who are they? Mr. Million Weng! Million Weng? Ask the chef to make some delicious sweet soup and cake for them. Wait I want one pot of precious tea too. Yes. I am going to get changed now Hi, Brother Million. Long time no see, how are you lately? Miss Sweetie, you look pretty and thin! Oh, thank you! Come on, take a seat. I ordered some good deserts and cakes for you. You know, I came here to visit His Excellency, your brother. Come on, he is your good friend; don't greet him as His Excellency! My brother is out of town, he will be back tomorrow. Why do you come for him? You know, my wife and your sister-in-law agreed to marry my girl to her son. So I bring my girl here to discuss the marriage. Your daughter? Yes. She is beautiful! May I know your name? Nightingale. Oh, she sounds like a nightingale too. Let me take a good look at you! You are beautiful and have a good figure. I think you're just like a princess! Really? My nephew Jin is wonderful too. He looks handsome and smart. They are just a perfect match! About their wedding, just count on me. Your family is so righteous and nice. I have to count on you now, Miss Sweetie! Come on Have some desert first. Thank you. Let's talk about something serious. Please go ahead. Last time you told me to buy the stock of "Hua-tien Mobile", I made a big fortune! So, this time, what would you suggest to me? Be frank, I was deeply affected by the recent financial tsunami, I almost lost everything. You're so rich; you won't lose much, huh? It's just too humble of you. I have been in really bad luck! The Lehman Bank went bankrupted, I just lost all my money! Wait. Wen, Ji, take all the food inside. I haven't finished yet! Piggy, Doggie, send the guests to the door. Wait I have been a good friend of your family. I benefited your family before. Let bygones by bygones. Though you're poor, be tough, okay? What made you come up the idea of selling your daughter? You think I am here to sell my daughter? It's a marriage agreed before she was born! Who agreed with it? Your wife and my sister-in-law died. You want a marriage? Go to hell then. You have got poisoned lips! No wonder no one wants to marry you! Kidding! I just don't want to marry inferior guys! Look at your daughter, she is so thin! She doesn't even have a good figure! She looks cheap too! I look... cheap, but you are... a bit... Bitch! You have stammering tongue! Why do you have stammering tongue? I don't know... why! Stop pretending! Get lost! Your brother and I are buddies. Why do you treat me like this? Don't be silly! Just forget your buddy! Get them away! Run! Run! Run! Run now! It's your fault! Why did you stammer? I... I don't... Know... why! Who am I? My dad. Who is that woman? A bitch! This is great! Why do you have sudden stammer? I don't stammer... when I give... short answer. Oh my God! Pearl is backing home! I have been long waiting for your return! Put it down now. Let me take a look at you! Come on; let me take a look at you! Wow, my dear sister! Did you always play basketball in Central China? You are so tall! Girl, let me take a look at you! Come on, let Queen Mother look at you! Let me see whether I still recognize you or not. I have finally seen you home! You grew tall and have got big eyes now. Girls are changing from time to time, you won't recognize her easily. You better check her gold medal. The gold medal will not change. The medal, right. Yes... The gold medal is real. Of course it is real. I remember... there is a scar on her back. That's true My daughter... Pearl I'm not the princess. She is Pearl! I am not the princess. I am not the princess. What? I am not the princess! What do you mean? Listen to me. Listen to what? You are not the little princess as before. Now, I am the emperor. From now on, you're Princess Ocean... No, You are Princess Pearl. But I am not... Come on! I am the emperor, of course I recognize my own sister. Someone told me that, when you were on the way home, you were left alone in the boat by the General. But luckily you were alive. This is really luck! I think she was scared to say that. Chun Yes Ask some doctors to visit her. Take Princess to her room for some body check please. Yes, Your Majesty. I don't want to be here, let me go. Please say a word for me... Princess, if you don't want to stay here, let me report to His Majesty, okay? I have figured it out, I am the Princess! I love all the famous brands... I just love them all! Brother, you are lucky to come home late. If you came home earlier, you would have got troubles! What is it about? Million Weng brought his daughter here to seek for advantage! So I kicked him out of here. You know you're Mister Nice Guy. You'd have promised everything. Sis, how could you do that to my benefactor? Fa-da Wu, you are heartless! Hey, I already kicked you out of my door! Why do you return? Piggy and Doggie, come here... Sis, there is something wrong with you! Go and see whether my benefactor is hurt or not. Doggie, Piggy! Please take him into the house. Bro, this guy has gone bankrupted. He came here to take your advantage! If he has trouble, I sure must help him. He came here to force your son to marry his girl. It doesn't sound good to say the word "force". My wife and his wife agreed the marriage. I came here to keep the words. It's a good deed to keep promise. How long have you known his girl? Do you understand her? This is all about the future life of your son! That's right. By the way, she stammers! What? That's a problem! Say hello to His Excellency. Your Excellency, nice to meet you. Sounds good! What's your name? My name... is Nightingale. What are you good at? Music, chess, reading, painting. She doesn't stammer! Just a coincident! Speak again if you dare! You bitch! Shut up! You... You stammer, don't you? I want to curse you! Enough! How can you put hard times on my benefactor? Men, take Mr. Weng to the room. Brother Weng, I think... Let's talk about the marriage after my son's return. Sure! What do you think? Yun, Ji, why are you still standing here? Guest room. Do... you want to sleep in guest room? You can only sleep in the kitchen! It's better than sleeping in the street. So what? You... you are driving me crazy! Long life to Empress Dowager. Oh, my dear girl! I have brought you some cakes. You loved these cakes when you were a kid. Come on. Thank you, Your Highness. Your Highness, come and take a seat. You'd greet her Queen Mother, not Your Highness. Thank you, Queen Mother. My dear. When you were small, your King Father sent you to study abroad. That's why you lived alone for a decade. It's just a tough time for you! Your Highness, take a seat please. Your Queen Mother has been missing you badly, she got sick! Come on, the towel please... I don't need it. I don't have to cry now, I am not sick now. Oh, forget it. I am not sick now. I am so happy to meet my girl again, I feel so good now! One more, two more, three more, four more Isn't it fate? So, just let it be! What did you say? Queen Mother, I want to show you how I walk. Isn't it what you have learnt from abroad? But it is something different. Nice. Hey, where is my mother? What's up? Who hanged my mother up there? Maybe she likes being hung like that. It's so funny! Are you obsessed? Your mother... Guys! Hang him over there too. Watch my Finger Stance! Oh, still missing something! Your Majesty! What's the matter with you? Please don't bother me from practicing. What are you practicing Your Majesty? Oh my God. What am I practicing? Look at you! You walked in a weird way, and thus confused me. So, let's forget all those practicing, and tonight we will... I don't care what you are thinking and talking. Anyway, stop saying anything nonsense to me. Your Majesty! Queen, I think you have forgotten my wish. Let me tell you one more time. I want to practice hard... In order to acquire enough power... to protect the citizens of our kingdom. I want to stop crimes, I want to keep the peace of the universe. However, in order to acquire super power, I must be a virgin. My ultimate mission is... to save the world! Auntie... My dear nephew, you are home! I was appointed as the scholar at last! Your dad is the senior official, now you won the glory for the family! Auntie, you're right! Where is dad now? Your father just made me angry! He wants to give you hard time with some outsiders. Auntie, what is it about? Without your consent, he agreed to marry you with someone before your birth. Now, he wants you to marry a thin and stammered beggar. What? My dear son! My dear son! Dad! I am so proud of you to be the scholar! We'll have double happiness if you get married soon. Dad, marriage is a serious issue. I have already in love with someone. You have got a lover? Wow, that's wonderful! I will back you up! Well, you go in there, give her a glance. Then tell her that you won't marry her. For the rest, I'll fix it for you. Thank you, my dear auntie. What is your lover? How did you meet her? I wanted to buy a bag for carrying my reference books. It's fate that made me meet her. She is so pretty, I am fascinated. My heart beat fast, I just couldn't control myself. This bag costs 20 taels. All right. Please. Wow, this bag is of limited production, only 10 are sold. I offer is 30 taels What are you looking? Don't you think it doesn't look good on me? My offer is 50 taels. My offer is 60 taels. One hundred taels. Are you kidding? It doesn't worth that much! Shopping here, you shouldn't care the price. As long as you buy something you like. I want this bag no matter what price it is. Miss... Miss, please stay! A pretty bag should go to a pretty woman. Please take it. At that time, I know we fell in love at the first sight. But she didn't take that bag. And this bag became the pledge of our love. We agreed that, on the day I was appointed the scholar, our love story would be continued. Is she stupid or innocent? If I were her, I would have taken the bag away for re-sale. No matter what, I want to marry her. What a pity that, she didn't appear as promised. Perhaps she fell for another gentleman. We fell in love at the first sight. I would suicide for love if our love story fails to continue. My dear son, don't be silly! Tell me her name. I'll search her for you. Her name sounds as good as her voice. Her name is Nightingale. Nightingale? That's right. What a coincidence! The stammering beggar is in the kitchen. Hey, come on. You must be Shang-jin! Come here please, this is your fiancee. My daughter Nightingale. But she is not my Nightingale. What? That's good news! Hey, do you want to dump my girl? In that case, it will be shameless of her to marry another guy! Cry! It's not my fault at all. Wu Fa-da! Bro Million! What do you suggest? Bro Million! I don't want to force my son to do something he dislikes. Okay, you can blame me of breaking the promise. I'll pay your loss with money, okay? Stop! This sounds reasonable. Since you ruin the reputation of my daughter, it is a must to pay us money. Since we are friends, let's not bargain. No bargain... One million taels Bro. I am good at bargaining. Step aside, it's dangerous! Dear, better be smart. Dad, charge up! I am going to praise my daughter in front of you. She is sweet and pretty, many guys want to woo her. But she knows she must marry him but no one else. When she arrived, you refused to marry her. No matter what I said, you have enough excuses to reject her. In order to compensate her broken heart, you are requested to pay us one million taels. Dad... You are... great! I see, you want to rap, don't you? I can rap too. It's insane of you to ask for so much money. I can hear nothing about your request. I would like to offer what I want to offer. If you want to mess up, you'll get no penny at all. She is worth nothing! She stammers which makes me laugh and tease. I don't see any good of her. So I would only offer you a tael as compensation. I offer a million and you counter offer one tael? You're not sincere enough. This is so called bargain! Take it or leave it. You counter offer with your poisoned lips. And this isn't a reasonable bargain at all. You must be reasonable. Okay, I will have a discount of ten thousand taels. I won't pay cause she is not worth. I think I am wasting my time to bargain with you. I don't want to waste my time anymore. I'll give you one more tael, then, disappear right now! Preserved bean cube? You brought us good meal yesterday, didn't you? Miss said that you might become our in-law the day before. But today, you have become a jinx. So, we won't serve you good meal anymore. So, let's wait and see your reply! Auntie, why are you addicted in such game? Have you found your Miss Right? I just lost her. All right. Please help me to up-date my photo. I want big eyes and high nose. And good figure of course. Don't you show others your real look? Playing virtual love for long time is no fun! Who knows what is true or false? No one cares about it at all. Come on. But how can you seek for true love on paper? Who said so? Come... Well, this is the one. We almost reached a stage of dating. Wow, he looks smart! Why didn't you date him? I sent out a pigeon for dating. But that bird didn't return. It smells good. What are you doing? You killed my Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen! I see, you like that, don't you? Well, this is for you too. You killed my "Chow Yun-fat", I wanna kill you! Don't mess up! Don't lose your mind! What do you want? Keep out from me. I want to kill you! I want to kill you to revenge my friends! Wait! What's up with you? Auntie, stay calm first. He killed all my "Honey". I don't believe that you dare to move! To hell with you! Bravo! Blood! Just sweating. I'll avenge again when I'm back. Let's go! Wow, blood! Let's go to stop blood! General Bing. Don't call me General. So, what should I greet you? Call me Mister Bing. Mister Bing? We just want to search for the princess. So, why should we illegally immigrate here? If she hasn't returned yet. We would be caught because... we failed to protect the princess and caused her disappearance! If this further causes the war between the 2 countries, it would be shit! But it's still shit for we have no clue at all to search for the princess. Let's sneak in first, just wait and see. This is no good, let's run. This is good, let's go in and get some information. This is a messy place. Shouldn't we go to the government office to get info from the cops? You're ignorant! People won't tell lies after drinking. So, the information we get here will be absolutely trustable. Handsome guy, try our new wine please. You'll get one free if you buy two. Okay, I want two bottles then. Thank you, handsome guy! Wow, how can she tell such lies! I think people here are honest. Let's play... Four shrimps. Five crabs. Six fishes Open! Not enough fishes, drink it. What made you open it? How can you open it, six fishes only. They drank much I am sure we can get info from them, follow them Shall we play together? You got wine? So, sit down and play, come on. What's up with you? Your dices fell. So what? Drink it. If you can't drink, don't bother to drink in the bar. He is quite busy to drink, I want to challenge you. Sure! Two fishes. Three shrimps Four crabs. Five bottle gourds. Six fishes. Open! Open! I got five fishes. But I got nothing! Stupid! This Hua-tien dice can transform to all kinds. Are you an illegal immigrant here? You know nothing at all! It's not true. Okay, I'll drink it. Have you finished? Yes, but I feel dizzy now. All right, more wine will keep you a sane mind. Good! Auntie, look! What a good world it is! Many people here I tell you, if you meet your Mr. Right, your heart will beat fast, you will sweat too and your hands will be trembling, cause it's love at first sight. My friend is so drunk. I'd better take him away. Enjoy, let's play later. Let's go Wow, he is so strong! Hey, you drank all my wine, do you want to leave like this? You asked me to drank, but you drank mine too. My wine is different. My wine is some precious old wine; it's made 870 years ago. You can't leave without leaving some money. How much do you want? Make it a hundred taels. I suggest you go robbing! I won't pay a penny! Do you want to beat me? Go beat him! Beat him! Oh, my God! What did you say, Auntie? Those guys are trash! Oh my God! Auntie, that guy is just a scum. But I think he is great! Look at his small eyes, they look sneaky. Big eyes don't mean any good. But he is thin. Too many fats mean not healthy. But those lovers in your virtual world are handsome. More pretty the pictures are, more... He looks really special to me. I used fake pictures too. Anyway, the outlook is just skin. For men, his cultivation and talent are most important. Bravo! You have my support. I told you not to beat me. I am sorry... Handsome guy, I know you're good at fighting, But you still have to pay for my loss after this mess. How much is it? Two hundred taels. I don't have that much money with me. Take my credit card. Thank you, handsome guy! My name is Shang-jin Wu, may I know your name please? Bing Rong Mai. Nice to meet you. About the money... Come on, it's peanut. So, thank you. Isn't it the first time you enjoy here? Yes. I always have fun in the south. Today, it's just a chance to come to the north. So, I came here to look for my friend. This is Miss Wu, she comes here to look for someone too. May I know who you are looking for? I am looking for a girl with big eyes. Big eyes can view better. She has heart-shaped face. It means fortune. She has medium figure, but she is really rich. She is from the royal family! Oh, I see! Sir. May I be excused? Do... you always have fun here? That's right, ladies shouldn't drink frequently. Let me order some water for you. Forget the water. Why don't we go to my home and enjoy more alcohol? But I have to take care of this fatty. Let's make another appointment. This is simple, I have many guest rooms. Come to my place, I can take care of this fatty for you. I feel dizzy; better find a place to sleep. Let's go. Okay, thank you for your hospitality. Please. Please This way please You are finally home! How about our negotiation? What is it about? Do you pretend to lose your memory? You broke my head! Now, we have to negotiate from the very beginning. I am sorry I think you've mistaken me as someone else. Why is she so gently speaking? I think you mistake me as... my twin sister. Twin sister? How can you lie like that? She wants to court the guy! Hey, how lucky I am! Why are you so happy? The bitch wants to be in love! We'll have a chance to win because I know her secret! What does that bitch want? That's none of your business. Let me have a nice hair cut, and then treat you to some good food. This way please. Please. Please. Mister Bing, this way please. Thank you. This way... Thank you. Miss Wu, thank you so much. That guy we just saw seems to be so angry. Why not ask your twin sister to meet him? Otherwise, you'll be in trouble. Good night. He shows his care to me! Mister Bing... Mister Bing... I've made you some soup. Where is he? So handsome! There are so many empty rooms, but she just doesn't give me one. I don't care, I just want to have a good sleep tonight. Room 1818 I like it. What a big world! It's fate to meet you at last. I love you, it's really my luck. You can take my advantage... Anyway, I love you. I know you also are fond of me. Since we are adults, let's not be shy and waste time. Let's have a kiss! Wow, he is really hot! Sorry, I am in a wrong room. Enjoy yourself. Oh no! I am so annoyed! I want to kill you! Give me back my first kiss! How dare you take my first kiss? I want to kill you! I am sorry, I have a clear picture now. This is my room. I have a clear picture too. I entered a wrong room. I know everything. I just entered the room. Mister Bing. I made you some nutritious soup. Are you that... You mistake it again! That is my twin sister. Sister again? So where is she now? She just went away through that window. May I be excused? I want to look for my sister. Empress Dowager. What's up? I want to quit! Come on! Why do you want to quit? Your son refuses to sleep with me. How can I give birth to your grandson then? What's up? You bitch! How dare you disclose my secret? So what? Stop dreaming! Of course I wish to. Queen, don't get mad. Tomorrow will be a better day. What do you mean? How do you know tomorrow will be a better day? That's not your hubby, you know nothing at all. You are not yet married, how do you know that? She gave me a wry face! Damn Your Majesty. You spoke obscenities. I have a suggestion. Why don't you pick a husband for the princess? Let's celebrate Pick a husband for the princess? Good idea It's really a good idea! Let's find the best man in our kingdom for the princess. No, I already have a lover. What lover? Did you meet him in Central China? Is he the second generation of the royal families? Oh my son, you fix it, okay? Girl is shy, you know that? It's really a good thing to have a wedding party! I am searching my exit in the mist. I hope to meet your foot steps with luck. If I see you again, I will tell you my heart. Oh, I am in love with you. To recite such a good poem. I think only a cultured scholar like you can make it. Thank you. If you can't drink, just don't drink that much! Thank you! Bottoms up! Hey, come here! God Kwan will help you. There is nothing to do with God Kwan, right? Look! God Kwan is living in the moon. He is so righteous! If you make a wish to him, he will help you to find princess. Who told you this? My mom. Who told your mom about this? I told her. Let's go back for some sleep, you're drunk. Why don't you trust me? Why don't you trust me that I have two swords? Why don't you say something?

Get him out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Your crying face looks so disgusting! General, please stop drinking. Pearl... Tell me, why don't you love me? General, she loves you! It's true! She used to laugh when I sang to her. But she didn't have any reaction when I just sang. Will you mistake her as someone else? I held her hands for thousand times, how can I mistake her? Or, you are missing princess too badly, so you're mentally retarded. You are underestimating me. You're underestimating me. You're underestimating me. Who dares to cheat my sister? I think I am really drunk. I think you're really drunk! Why? Oh, she is the princess! So, princess is still alive! So is this Pearl, wait for me! One hundred taels. What made you be so generous? Is there any trick? When I see you, I think of your daughter. When I think of her, I think of the heartless man. When thinking of the heartless guy, I want to kill someone!

Maybe, we can get some money from the emperor. What if no one comes to kidnap her? That would be shit... Shit! Hey, what isn't there anyone coming? This princess is weird! She has sat there for 6 hours! Freezes Why isn't anyone here to kidnap her? I am starving! Why isn't he coming forward?

But I just can't imagine you'd come to kidnap her at night. Now, you're caught red-handed. Men, get them out for execution! Yes, Your Majesty! Wait! Stop the execution! Sweetie. Are you tired? How can you recognize me? Well, it's not difficult to recognize you at all. Sweetie! Do you want to kidnap the princess late at the night? But we are here and the princess is inside, How could we do anything to the princess? You want to deny, don't you? So, why do you dress in black at night? I can tell there is conspiracy. But according to the laws of Hua-tien, is it not allowed to dress in black at night? Well... But you all dress in black late at the night, and you look so tough, walking around in my garden. Isn't there conspiracy? But according to the laws of Hua-tien, can one walk in the royal garden in black and look tough? Have a walk? You guys all at the late night. Dress in black and bustle fight in my royal garden... Stop denying, I witnessed that! Your Majesty. According to the laws of Hua-tien, can't we practice kung-fu in the royal garden at night? Sweetie, you talk back again and again, you're giving me a hard time, huh? Just give me face, forget this incident, okay? Please let us go! Okay, since you voice out... Now, I am going to issue two more laws. No one is allowed to dress in black late at night. You're wise, Your Majesty! And, no one is allowed to dress in black at night... to fight in my royal garden! You're really wise! Okay, tow them out for execution, except you! Your Majesty! Brother Jin... Oh, Nightingale! Sis, what are you doing? Sister? She is not your sister. What? Isn't she my sister? So, is she my mom? Oh, my girl, you're alive! Dad! Dad? Yes, this is your daughter! Do you have two daughters? Dad, dad! Dad! Don't you think I have got Alzheimer's disease? But your dad has got beard and scar. When does he have a son? Pearl. Why do you disguise as the prince? Who is the princess? Yes, she is your sister! Bastard! What are you bluffing? She is his daughter, why is she my sister? She isn't my blood daughter! Damn it! Are you fooling me? You send your daughter here to pretend as the princess, and then send a non-blood daughter to disguise as the prince. And you trash! You hold some hair late at the night! And you claim that you're not disguising as yourself! Do you want to topple my kingdom? I am innocent, Your Majesty! Innocent? Your conspiracy is disclosed at last! Damn it! Okay, let me go home to get changed, after a bath and massage... I'll then give you rebellions a trial. How dare you want to topple my kingdom! It's not harsh enough to beat you fifty times. Speak up! Tell me all about your plan! Your Majesty... I want her to get married, but she jumped to the sea. I want her to substitute her and live a happy life, but we met her and messed up my plan. And she gave me her first kiss. What? First kiss? At last, you took her to the competition. Hey, it seems that it is my fault. Oh no! I hit you fifty times! Men, come here, give him five hundred thousand tales. Thank you, Your Majesty! Sweetie... How do you explain your first love? Well, this is just a misunderstanding. Shang-jin loves this girl, so I stopped him to sell his girl. Shang-jin would sacrifice his life for the girl. So, I just want to save her. Love! Oh, I failed because of love. Love, who can say it's right or wrong? Your Majesty! It's not the right time to sing now. Let's finish the trial first. I am sorry. You're right, I agree with you. Love is great! You're right. Hey, Mister Violence! You've got a lover. Why do you want to marry the princess? I did everything for Nightingale. Nightingale is the princess, so I want to kidnap her. If she is the queen, then I'll kidnap the queen. You promise! But you don't have to do it now, better be quick. Do you know it's a crime to pretend as the princess? Shang-jin and I are in love. I lost my mind and wanted to commit suicide. But he saved my life. Then you grabbed me here and forced me to be the princess. Why didn't you deny? I did, but you just didn't trust me. Since the Empress Dowager is missing badly the princess, So I am forced to pretend. You are filial to a granny, whom you don't know at all. You can tell it is a conspiracy! From this angle, you're guilty! Bang, what would you like to say? Your Majesty, my name is Bing. I am the General in Central China. Pearl and I have fallen in love for ages. On the way home, I met my Waterloo by accident... Sorry... Sorry... But you are alive here! How did you meet your Waterloo? I am sure you're lying! Your Majesty, as what you have heard... I am most suspicious... I do think there is something wrong with me. However, in order to meet Pearl again, I must join the competition. But out of my expectation that... My first rival is Pearl! Well, isn't it coincidence? What a coincidence! What? Do you think... is she my sister? It's true, Your Majesty! Are you my sister? I don't know. Your Majesty, she lost her memory. No wonder she failed to recognize me! Oh, she lost her memory! Don't tell me this old trick! We are just wasting time to get nothing here. I just want someone to be the scapegoat now. But I love my citizens most. Okay, let's kill an immigrant! Men... Tow this General out for execution. But I have just figured out something. I am not the most suspicious guy. Why do you want to kill me? You failed to protect the princess. And you illegal immigrated into my kingdom. And you intended to rape the girl who lost memory! Also, you disturbed me from sleeping. You just deserve death. Do you agree? To hell with you! Pearl. Don't forget me! Pearl, I am Bing... I am Bing... Pearl... Pearl. Bing? Finally you recognize me! Pearl! Hey, it's late now, let's cut the crap. Execution now. How dare you! Explain to your brother now! Don't you take me as your sister? How dare you kill my boyfriend? Are you insane or have you just lost memory? Do you think you are my sister? In Central China, who mailed you the secret scroll for the stance of Quick Steps? How dare you claim me of a fake? Everyone knows I am crazy for kung-fu. It can't prove that you're my sister. You guys look sneaky! I won't be cheated by you guys! Tow him out for execution! I order you to stop! Let him go! Let him go! Of course I know my daughter! Queen Mother! My girl, you're finally home! My Dear. Queen Mother, don't take anyone as your daughter please! Son! Look! This flower was tattooed, when Pearl left home. It's a mark for me to recognize her. Look. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Okay... I have found my sister. Now, a family re-union makes everyone happy! Get this General out for execution now. Then, let's call it a day! Stop it! Why not? He failed to finish his mission. And he caused this mess! Your Majesty! Empress Dowager has just got well. It's not suitable to let her view such violent scene. For the sake of her health. How about celebration? Celebration again? Yes, celebration! Bravo! Let's celebrate... Let's celebrate all together. I'll forgive all of you. And I would like to make the royal match for you. Sister, I allow you... to marry the General from Central China. And my fake sister, I allow you... to marry this violent scholar, okay? Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Your Majesty. And about Sweetie... Why don't you in love with handsome guy? So. I have to marry this guy with you. Objection, Your Majesty! Why do you do him this favour? Actually, I have been in love with someone else. If you want to match for me, why not match him for me? Oh I see! Who is that guy? He is a cultured guy. Listen to his poem. Red tea, green tea, chrysanthemum tea. Long time no see. Lychee, apple, and pear. I always want to see you dear. Papaya, water melon and melon. I love you man. Are you kidding? I miss you miss you miss you. A pigeon will kiss you. I love you love you love you. I just want to say I love you. Oh no! You're Copperfield! And you are Madonna! I just have my sixth sense! Truth is far from imagination! You're a big surprise to me too! Why didn't you return my mail? I went bankrupt. That's why I had to kill the pigeon for food. Since you are pen-pals. Now, it's a happy ending. Okay, kiss now. All right! Since you have a throw up already... Let's call it a day! Wait, Your Majesty! What? I've got... You got what? Acne? Come on, I am pregnant! I am having your baby! Are you kidding me? Bravo! I will have a grandson soon! Wow, everyone is so happy now! Since Queen Mother is so happy too, I have nothing to say. Let's sing! Okay! Let's sing happily! Happiness in Hua-tien Kingdom. With happy endings! We wish you a good fortune!
