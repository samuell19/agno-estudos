(bells tinkling gently) (birds chirping) (soft wind whistling) (soft gentle music) (items cluttering) (door hinge cringing) (gentle wind blowing) (John coughing) (brisk soft music) (door locks rattling) (helicopter engine roaring) - Hey, what's up man, I hate to be that guy. I was the fool who did not pick up smokes on my way home from work, would you mind if I... (helicopter engine roaring in a distance) My contribution. - What is that the hope diamond. - I think it is an ashtray. - You just moved in? - Yeah, like three or four hours ago. I'm leaving the city soon, so I just basically packed up all shit my at my old place. Sold it off there, found this place. No lease, snatched it up online, sight unseen. How long have you been here? - I have an ex-husband hence just started smoking. About a decade, which I guess makes me the de facto ambassador to the new tenants. - Does your ceiling have any leaks? - Ruin any of your stuff? - Nothing to ruin. - Well my ex actually left a bunch of stuff in the garage that I was just gonna donate. If you want to have it for some temporary like furnishings and stuff. - That is really kind of you. And I will actually take you up on that. I would say let's just do it now, but you directly ahead off the surgery doctor. - Yeah, I'm a wedding photographer and I just fell asleep and might get up right after the reception. There's this kind of Autumnal equinox goth wedding. The thing is awesome about LA is there still is huge goth scene. So they we're just slinging around cocktails all night but started with blood and I got hit. - I'm about to blow your mind. The bar I work at last night is like the dark wave electro goth. I think, I dunno it looks like so like the Renaissance Fair to me, but I was wondering why I was getting more bloodtinis spilled all over me than usual. And now I know, it is the, what'd you say? It was the autumn-in-al... - Autumnal. Autumnal equinox. (helicopter engine roaring) - Its when the weeds turn brown and the hills burn and everything smells like barbecue all the time, it's beautiful. - Oh shit. Check this out. Last night up on that hillside. I saw this guy. - Well here is like Halloween, which is all the time. Is that your new place? - Yeah, that's it. That's my temporary digs. - It's actually been vacant since I moved in. So it's kinda nice to have somebody watching out over us over the neighborhood. It's getting worse. Vagrants. - It's been vacant for over a decade? Someone like murdered there or something? Well that's supposed to have something disclosed to me, what's up? - Actually, yeah. A 90-year old grandma just threw grandpa out of a window and he fell face first, right where you're standing. (airplane engine roaring) - At least we are cheap ride to the airport. - There is this dude sits at my bar and he always says this thing. He says, "Hey, it can only fall so fast." (John chuckling) I hope what that dude said to me is going fast enough to not feel the impact. - Oh no, I made that up. No one died. I was just kidding. Anyways. I got to get these bad boys. Motor checked and charged before church. So why don't you just swing on by when you want to move in your stuff. - Oh, here I go, bad neighbor, I am John. - Oh, Levi. All right. Hey, thank you for this. - Check it out. That's hungry Dave. He is really aggressive. Don't let him get to eye level. Okay? (wind whistling) (bells tingling gently) (static noise) (ominous music) - What we think went wrong, either one of two things happened. Either they were trying to put together this really intricate, beautiful cosmic puzzle. And some of those pieces were extraordinary or the way they jammed them together. It just created this abstract mess that then they could imbue with whatever meaning they wanted. It doesn't really matter because it affected them in very different ways. And I don't think anything is worth what happened. I still believe part of it was real. You can catch it in scientific terms, it doesn't really matter because the result is the same. And it's really sad. (ominous music) I don't just mean the dead one. - And there is this yellow tail, but between me and it's like this little like cavernous that has some eel grass on it. - And it's like 19th century lobster trap that just busted out of it, right? And then... boom. I looked down, there's a fucking claw around my arm. I look up, there's a lobster the size of Danny fucking DeVito. I kid you not. And he's dragging me and I'm so fascinated but then I look in it's eyes that I almost forget I'm loaded and I can shoot left-handed. Just take aim and shtoonk, spear the shit out of it. Barely face it. Just kind of saunters off back into its cave. I've never seen that lobster again. I never saw that spear again. I didn't get that big ass tuna, but that was the day I learned that it's like, yeah, there's a lot of good sushi places in Los Angeles, but I don't fuck with lobster rolls. Lobsters are intelligent creatures. - You can hop on my wifi network if you want to. - My signal is shockingly good here, but I might take you up on that. What is your network? - It's "Behold the promised LAN" like L-A-N, it used to be Mr. Rogers neighborhertz, but that was Lonnie's. It is not even clever. Oh, the password is easy to remember. It's "JUDGEMENT DAY" all caps. - There's like a billion fucking networks. So I'm gonna have to mess with this later. But now I actually have to get to this charity thing I do at the youth shelter. Can I grab you something for the way out? Like a beer or something? I really appreciate all this. - No, thank you. Actually, I don't drink. - Good for you, bro. How long have you been sober? - Now 10 years, honestly, Lonnie was an AA. So that kinda made me an AA, but never even had a problem. I just kinda got way into it. Stuck with it. I don't know. - Okay, cool. Don't forget your plant, on the way out. - Oh no, no that's yours. That's actually a house warming gift. My grandma runs this little nursery up in the central valley. I give her a hand with sometimes. (phone ringing) Speak of the angel. - [John] Hey actually, do you mind if I take this up here. - Disappears in the courtyard. - And do what you gotta do. - Hey grandma. I could probably just head on up there next Sunday, like usual, you know. Yeah. I of course will groom myself and wear a suit. Not just for God, but for you. All right, I am into that. All right, may you go. I love you. Bye. She's out of her mind, man. See you. - Can I interest you in? One for the road. - Yeah. Thank you. (soft wind whistling) (ominous music) (wind whistling) - Did you forget something? - You should just come and see this. (ominous music) - It was moving on its own or something invisible was moving it. There was a this light. - Yeah, no, absolutely. No doubt. I feel bad about this, I actually do have to get to my charity thing at the youth shelter, but I don't want to rush you. - Totally. Yeah. What are we gonna do? Or we're gonna like stand around all day and talk about how I thought I saw a ghost in a new apartment. I'm sorry. I'm the weirdest neighbor you knew ever. And don't be a stranger. (ominous music) (crystal clattering) (ominous music) (door banging) (diminishing invigorating music) - That's so dumb. - No, it's just weird. It's like you go your whole life thinking certain things are always gonna be a mystery. Like the identity of Jack the Ripper or Bermuda triangle or the great pyramids. - Pyramids aren't a mystery anymore. I saw this YouTube video and they're just ramps in wet sand. - All right. Well, a lot of things are still mysteries. You just don't expect to witness one on a shitty afternoon in your cheap apartment, - We are more surveilled than ever in our own history. Everyone has a camera phone in their pocket and we still don't have even a single actual bit of evidence for a ghost or supernatural, whatever. (ominous music) Man, there it is. It's right there. - It's weird though. I don't necessarily feel. (ominous music) Do you feel scared? - When it was happening, when we're looking at it, I really did, but it's getting replaced by something. - All right, this is gonna sound weird because you and me just met but when I first moved out to LA, you get a job bar backing. And one of my first days I'm polishing a glass and this dude behind the bar is like, "Hey, how long are you gonna give it?" Like, how long am I gonna give it to strike gold out west? And I tell him, actually what do you think I told him? - 39 Years. - I said 10 but it ended up being 20. And I'm still driving the same shitty Mustang, same bottle, except my kidneys hurt, I am self medicating and pretty sure my liver is shot. All right, so like photography, right? Like that was supposed to be your golden egg. The thing you're passionate about, the thing that allows you to make a living, but it hasn't worked out for you yet. Life tons of things like that, dude, tons. Life's weird. Like sometimes things just don't happen, but that happened, right? And that's more scarce than gold. It's like proof of the supernatural. That's like, book deals and like movies and like TV shows and like religious views and shit getting. - So what do we do? (knocking on the door) - Hello? Hello. - Hello. (airplane engine roaring) - Oh Jesus. - So, the house I grew up in, had this big ass windows, the pigeons could not see, they just slam into it. And you can't tell at first, whether they are just like stunned or their brains are mush, we build these things and it protects them. So they don't get eaten by like a cat and shit while we wait to see if they wake up or not. - Oh, we will never get the full effect of it on a podcast. - What? - We're gonna try to prove the supernatural. We're gonna need some kind of visuals. People won't believe it. - What are you thinking like a YouTube channel or something? - YouTube is like a whole like subscriber, metadata algorithm, hot girl thumbnail, like channel subscribe. I don't understand YouTube. I was thinking a documentary. - All right. Well, I actually do have to run to work now, but I don't think I work tomorrow night. If you wanted to reconvene then get it started. - Yeah, let's do it. - All right. (Levi groaning) Is it possible this is extremely dangerous and we just completely overlooked that part? - No one's ever died of like a demon or a ghost or whatever. It's always just slamming cabinets and doors and like cold spots and stuff. - Totally. So if it gets dangerous, we just stop. Easy, right? I'll see you then. Can you take care of that to put somewhere safe on the side of the house. Hey, hi. So sorry. I did not make it to the thing. - Yeah. First I did find it a little bit strange that the youth shelter that Levi volunteers that would send somebody to check on him when he doesn't show up, but... - [Isabel] I'm sorry. I think your bio was in one of the destroyed hard drives. Maybe let's get that first. Okay? - Yeah. Okay. - [Levi] Just because this feels a little bit weird is okay. If I just look at you, I know John likes it like this, but you could just. - [John] I started out with photography and I thought a better way to finance photography was to become a math teacher. I thought it'd be more chill. I thought I'll be the cool teacher, but those kids they just hated me. Even though I adjusted the curve so much, I should've been fired. Some people, they like kids, but they are not good. Anyways, I fell in love with Lonnie and chased him out here to LA. Now I spend my days and nights charging scooters, and I hope that the rent check clears so that I'm not moving in with my grandma when I'm in my thirties. Move on to the convict thing? - [Levi] I mean, I think the reason why I got into this with John was that I just loved watching X Files with my sister I was little. Now it's like everything like the X Files I guess. - [John] Even though Levi played it off really well, I knew something about that guy was... (soft soothing music) You know I'll say this. I can totally see why he wouldn't want to share like that. (ominous music) Hey, careful with the threading on that thing it's kinda old. Is your phone okay? - Yeah, I'm all good. - God, all that heat just coming from the closet? - Yeah, it is hot as shit. I have this theory that the downstairs unit is vacant and maybe like someone left on a heater or how kind of sweet would ghost fire be? - Yeah, how much do you think like Netflix pays for one of these documentaries. Let's say about movies selling at film festivals for millions of dollars. So I would say at least like 10 million, something like that. - Honestly, that sounds kind of low. Oh, hey. I know it's a little early for this, but I was thinking a little bit about the title. All right, check this out. "Something in the light." Isn't that cool? I get it. - Yeah, because of the fucking light. That's dope. I thought of one too. "The door that wouldn't shut." (door cringing) - For the title? That's cool. - Thank you. - It's probably got too syllables though, you know. Right? (camera shuttering) - I'm pretty sure that's almost the exact same amount of, what was the other one? - It's got one more syllable. It's hard to remember. So titles are important. (footsteps diminishing) (TV hissing) (air whooshing) - [John] Praise Jesus. (air whooshing) (crystal clanking) I guess that waits for you for that part. (crystal beeping) You rolling? You rolling? - Oh shit. (rapid beeping) - Wait. (camera beeping) Fuck. Camera overheated and the SD card was full. So we couldn't have gotten anything anyways. - I might've gotten something on the filming camera, but I doubt it and I didn't charge the batteries. So welcome to amateur hour. - Dude. I feel like if you get anything on day one, that's a win. - We didn't get anything. Your camera was completely out of focus. - I don't think it was. And also I just feel like this is an indicator that we need a better plan, better equipment, real cameras, real lighting, real microphones. - This is real. - No, but I mean like professional stuff, like when you see politicians and they got all microphones on their collars. We should like divvy up tasks. Like you be the main camera guy and I'll be the supplementary camera guy. I could do all the audio stuff. And you could do like the video organizing. - Data manager. - Data entry. Exactly. And obviously we don't know when exactly this thing's happening. We're probably going to take shifts. So, here you go. Remember to lock up, remember to leave all the windows open. So you don't fucking cook us. - You know this is how stupid people get murdered on "Dateline," right? - You're gonna murder me? - No one's getting murdered. And ghosts can't kill you either. - You keep saying that, but you're not Dana Fox or Mulder Scully. - How do you think a ghost kills someone. It has a ghost knife? They just like pull out their ghost shank and they stab you and ghost pre... What is that? - It's just like an energy supplement. I get out this nutropics website. - And is safe? - Yeah, it's just like a all natural amino acids. (ominous music) (upbeat religious music) (diminishing soft music) - Kind of hard to explain, but yeah. I mean, I'm kind of an idiot. I was supposed to do something with him tonight, but I forgot to get his contact info and he's not home so. Grandma you're genius. Yeah. He's gotta be on some kind of social media somewhere. (ominous music) Sorry. Yeah. I'll call you back later on. I love you. Bye. (banging on door) - What's up man. Oh, they make me dress like this for like the speakeasy and shit, it fucking sucks. Did I get the right hard drives? Dope, I actually, I picked up a high decibel camera right next to my work. So, I have that too. Did you get the gear? - Yeah. - Awesome. Okay. Are we're gonna do this or... - Yeah. - And the gear? - Yeah. (ominous music) (bell jingling) (ominous music) (camera stand falling) - Hey John. I know I said I could do this, but I was incorrect. Do you mind helping me out. Thanks bud. This camera's basically what I was talking about in terms of a bigger thing and actually never told you this. I was gonna buy a bunch of camera equipment several years back, but someone told me my tips would up to like 20 to 40% if I fixed my teeth. So I got braces, spent all the money on that. Didn't get the camera equipment, check this out. - You are on the audio. - Was I supposed to? - I already got it. - So, are you being weird because we forgot to run audio? - The other day in front of our place. Who was that? - That was my probation counselor. I told you I've got the charity thing I do at the youth shelter and they just get really weird when I don't show up or I'm late or anything. - You know that everyone would say there's a huge difference between volunteer work and mandatory community service. - I don't want to get caught up in the weeds of what exactly that's called. - You want to tell me what you did to get yourself a PO. - It is a not an interesting story, not even worth telling. So you read online that I'm a registered sex offender. - What? - I was having to go cocktails, during one of the big city-wide shutdowns and I had to piss really bad. There were literally no restrooms open anywhere. I see this alley, I go back there I am relieving myself and the next thing I know, I'm pissing all over my shoes because the cop handcuffed... (bottle breaking) That was the wall of a daycare center. A closed daycare center. - Is that true? - Yeah. It's true. I mean you can look up the court record that those things are really dry. And I just gave the cliff notes version and it's really hard to defend yourself against pedophilia allegations wearing a fucking bow tie. (soft humming) (TV humming softly) - We are rolling? - Yeah, we are rolling. (camera clicking) When I was younger I did this thing called geocaching. It's kind of like scavenger hunting, but for adults with the GPS and 10 or 20 years ago I found this book and it was really cool kind of pseudoscience coffee table book. It's called the "Geometry of Magnetism." And it's written in like Esperanto and the author's name was redacted. I swear to you, that symbol is on the cover of my book. - What? That's not very ghost like. - No. Do I seem okay? - I don't know. I don't know you. - No, I mean, do I seem like I'm having some kind of a psychotic break? - No, psychotic breaks are totally different. (soft wind whistling) - If you're a ghost, do something. (soft wind whistling) Do something different. I mean, we don't actually have any reason to think that this is a ghost or a Poltergeist. It's the first of movies or books that you've read. We might have this all wrong. - So what is it? - That's the question? (resonant rejuvenating music) The symbol that's on my book and that was on that refraction. I swear to God, I've also been seeing it all over the city. (resonant rejuvenating music) Look, all of this is the EM spectrum, ElectroMagnetic spectrum, it's radio waves on up to the visible light and this is using derivatives to find acceleration of velocity, but look the value for gravity is wrong. They just changed it. And I don't really know why. And then this is a ratio that's kind of like pi, which people call them golden ratio. - Are we quoting Dan Brown books right now? - What? - I'm not making it a Divinci Code documentary. - No, Jesus, no, it's just a ratio. It's not exactly the Fibonacci sequence or phi or the golden ratio or whatever. It's just an irrational number with infinite decimals out to infinity. There are millions of irrational numbers. This is common in the world and in math. And it has something to do with a rectangle, that when it's expressed as a ratio, it is that irrational number. I don't know what it means either. - This has nothing to do with nautilus shells the Grail or Stonehenge? (airplane engine roaring) (electric static noise) - Everything we've seen so far. It's either been on the EM spectrum visible light, radio waves or... (resonant rejuvenating music) Gravity. (resonant rejuvenating music) - Okay. So it's like, There is one for gravity and there's one for electrical shock. - Electromagnetism. - Right, yeah. - Maybe there's two of them. - Two what? Man, are the neighbors all right? - I heard there was a murder. - Hey, I keep having this thought. Mind giving me a light really quick? - I got you. - Jesus. Okay. Here you go. Don't forget you get to inhale. - When we first met, you said this phrase, it was, "You can only fall so fast." Why did you say that? - I wanted to be a skydive instructor. - No shit. - Yeah. - How many times did you jump? - One. - And then I was like, Hey, maybe I'll like start a band, but how do you find all those different people to play those individual instruments? And then I was like, well, maybe I'll get into like the skateboard apparel industry, but for some reason my parol counselor was really against me getting into fashion. And I wanted to work on a fishing boat in Jamaica, maybe like surfing tours or something. But there's some legal issues with the passport. The point is that nothing ever quite clicked. - Yes. I floated around a lot too. I feel like I was built for this. - I would also think I was built for this if my thing was electricity and treasure hunting and not gravity. - There's nothing to that? - I mean my entire life, I felt like there's like this invisible force just holding me back from accomplishing anything I dream about, anything I want to do. - That's super depressing and you should talk to a therapist about that. - I am not like a continuously depressed person. This cop just totally parked in my space. I just feel like someone chucked me out of an airplane when I was a baby. And I've been at terminal velocity my entire life. I didn't ask that person to chuck me out of that airplane. (cop cursing) - How does your parole work. (deep breathing) (knock on the door) You know it's insanely weird that you give apples to kids for Halloween. Actually you know it's weird, is that their parents don't just check the sex offender registry before they send them marching up to your door. You know, they're gonna check those apples for razors though. - The OD across the way was originally put it is a murder and parents still bring their children there. I don't think they're worried about the who guy peed on a wall. (camera shuttering) (ominous music) (door cringing) (ominous music) (items clattering) - [Robert] Well, basically when people buy or build on a property, they hire me to come in and assess for any geologic hazards, landslides, seismic activity, sink holes, volcanoes. - [John] Volcanoes? Are you serious? - Yeah. Volcanoes. (ominous music) - [John] That's awesome. Can you just tell me what you found in the soil samples beneath the apartment? - Yeah. Well, I know you were concerned that there were some anomalies. The chromium was a little high. There was some Lead in there. I have some from pre 1978 paint job, but everything was okay. No more arsenic or anything like that. - [John] The other. The other thing I know. - What's that? - [John] The crystal thing. - The crystal? - Are you all right? (footsteps approaching) - Do you mind shooting this real quick? - Why? - Well, it's supposed to be 175 and it's obviously much lower. And if gravity is fluctuating that much it could be really messing with the foundation of the building and that earthquake had just been a warning shot. - I don't want to invalidate what you're saying at all. It's just, you know what I mean we live in Los Angeles, there's earthquakes all the time and people's weight fluctuates. It's normal. I mean, it just think we've got to be kind of scientific about this, we can't just assign meaning to every little thing. - I get all that, but if in a month we got from some floating things and some lights to earthquakes by New Year's we would be under rubble. And we did agree when we started this, that if we felt like we were in danger, we'd stop. And I'm not saying we should stop. I think we should at least acknowledge this. - I've been giving some thought to that title you suggested. And honestly I think I just judged it a little too early and I think it's thematically resonant with what we're trying to do here. And I think we should use it. - "The door that wouldn't shut." (ghostly whistling) (Electric static noise) (ominous music) - Hey, can you mute that really quick? (ominous music) (door cringing) (ominous music) - I listen to this podcast, actually can you record that really quick on your camera? - So, we're rolling. - I have this podcast that I listened to by, I don't even know. He has this kind of wild unifying theory of the universe that the aliens actually planted the building blocks of life on earth as some kind of a science experiment. And they don't want to contaminate their experiment, which is why we don't hear from them, but we will make contact or they will make contact at some point once we are socially and politically evolved enough. So maybe that's now maybe that's us, and maybe the heat and all these critters and all of that is just the flora and fauna and weather on another planet. - And that's actually a really interesting, do you mind if I jump in there and just kind of, okay, I'm just gonna have to get that frame up. So here's the thing, I saw online the other day that basically scientists think that there are some planets sort of like earth, right? But the nearest one, like the nearest one that would have water, the nearest one to have like little critter like the one we've been hearing, it would be like 6,000 years away using the best technology we could possibly come up with. That being what it is, how do we explain it being in my attic? Also, where did you hear this podcast? - Just on a message board somewhere. - Are there message pods for more things than like anime and finding contract killers and stuff? - Just because something sounds a little bit crazy doesn't mean it's not partially true. I mean, that's how you find truth. MK ultra, that was actually mind control. COINTELPRO that was real, soft disclosure of UFO's just happened to Congress. - Here we are at the launch status center. Let's go inside and see if we can find anybody to talk to. NASA has known about a time traveler method of Albert Einstein. He said, if you travel at the speed of light, you can time travel. - Time travel. - Start over. (ominous music) - There is no light source. (ominous music) - Crystal? You mean the quartz deposits? - [John] Yeah, and how it can create electricity and focus. - It definitely doesn't create electricity because is the most abundant mineral in the world. If you have them underneath your house you're fine. (soft humming) (ominous music) - [John] In your own words. Just say what happened here? - I think that if one was to express what you thought happened to you, it might be seen as trying to garner some fame and attention. - [John] Wind a minute, you know, these things found us, we're not doing it for fame or recognition or anything like that. We just saw something profound and we wanted to share it with the world. I don't know what the problem with that would be. - I don't want to be rude. - [John] It's okay. It's okay. - Why didn't you play yourselves in the recreations? (door banging) - Is that exactly where the snake skin was? - Yeah. It was a little bit more in a closet, but I just pulled it a little out for the shot, just so it would show up more on camera on this side. - Okay. Cool. Well, I mean your sleep looked great. You wanna cut? - Yeah. Okay. Awesome. - All right. It's so weird doing all this stuff over again. It's like you're taking too many edibles and watch Unsolved Mysteries and you think you on the recreation sketch. - [John] Nope. - Pod of Orcas, apex predator of the sea and obviously an Orca has never attacked a human in the wild, but still just out of fucking respect. I hold out on the spear and one of them swims over. I call him Shamoo. He swam over and just gently ate the stingray right off my spear and then swims away with the parts singing these beautiful whale songs like just for me. - Hey I keep on having this idea. Actually do you mind rolling this really quick? I'm sorry. I just. - Yeah. Yeah. Let's do this. - So I think you're right about the distance thing with the aliens, I think it's impossible to had any contact, it's too far away, but if the universe is actually in 10 dimensions like this Ted talk I listened to, maybe these gateways to other dimensions are actually just all around us. And the gateways are right top of us. We just can't see them. So maybe your closet down there, that's just another gateway to another dimension that has different temperatures and different flora and fauna and our creators, trying to get us to do something. You like it? - See, that and this, just a couple of things I'm gonna miss about LA. - I think you're crazy if you are leaving. - I mean, this is gonna change everything. - The other night I was leaving my shift at work. I heard a little buzz and I'm walking home, walking up Sunset. There is always people who are getting ready for some big, dirty crazy night out. And you kind of feel the energy of it. And the Santa Ana winds are blowing and I look over and it's another coyote. He's looking right through me like I'm a ghost. And then he just trots off, down Sunset Boulevard, that big old coyote smile. And no one talks about like those moments in Los Angeles. People talk about the traffic. People talk about everything else, everything they can complain about, but they never talk about like those magical LA moments. - Yeah. You got to dig deep in the city for it but Magic is there. - Today I had this fantasy, I am living in some small town, like a small town, like in Stephen King stories, where you can afford rent and like some big ass Victorian house and get a dog and go to summer festivals and eat fresh produce. And this documentary would be like my retirement fund for that life. - You know, they chose this location for Hollywood because of the beautiful light? I am no Hemingway but I feel like we found light literally and metaphorically just righT down in your apartment. Maybe you should take that as a sign. Stick around a little while longer, finish this documentary. You'll see another magic coyote. Maybe I can set you up with someone. - Here we go. - What? - My guy, I've never been attracted to anyone. And that is a very hard thing to explain to people that you'd be interested in dating. (airplane engine roaring) - It's going a little unsettling. - You don't think that has anything to do with what we're doing downstairs, like it's Bermuda triangle shit. - No. I get the no attraction thing, but you know, Lonnie for all of his faults, for all the reasons it didn't really work out between us, to me at least he was accepting, he wanted to bring kids into this apocalypse, which is bonkers. - How do you mean? - I was out with this guy one time on one of the apps and we're talking about all the ways that the world could end. I mean, we're all gonna die, right? We're so fixated on not dying, but it's all gonna happen to us. So what's the big deal? I mean what's even the big deal with like genocides and then the conversation naturally led to my church and people get all binary when they hear the word evangelicals.
