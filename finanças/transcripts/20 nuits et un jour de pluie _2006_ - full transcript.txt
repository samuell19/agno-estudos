Then something terrible happened... I started to feel some strange things. Something completely meaningless... Our concept of time is gone forever. I don't know what happened... Something mysterious... but I am. The wind increases. The fog collapsed. Beat the band it started to rain. I can't see anything. Collapsed overnight. I thought you went down, in fact, I continued to climb. I was lost, I thought I would die. The thing is, this is not the case. I continue to climb. Then I saw a light. I think it is the devil. All data is recorded. My strength. I don't know what happened. I don't know a person inside me. Thank you. -You are welcome. Can you speak French? -A little bit. Very strange, this is... We...
