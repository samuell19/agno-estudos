Open. Today you're being released from the jail. David! I'm an orphan. No one comes to meet me. Atleast you come to see me. I've got a death penalty. My wife is young. Ask her to get married and live happily. Clothes Warehouse. Sign here. This is the wage for the work you did in all these years. Your purse. Your chain. Listen... Criminals are not kept in jail only for punishment. They are kept here, to realize their crime and repent for it. Rather than we improving you, it's better you improve yourself. David, your youth was spent in jail. Atleast now... Peter, in this holy place of God do you accept Mary as your wife? Yes. Mary, do you accept Peter as your husband? No! What are you saying? Are you mad? At such a time... Do you want to marry someone else? Yes Father. I want to marry David. Why are you destroying your life? What happiness can this illiterate man give you? He doesn't have the ability to earn a dime! lf you marry him, I won't give you a penny of my wealth! Take this. I don't want your wealth. I want a good husband. For him, I'm ready to make any sacrifice. - Your fate is bad! Let's go! - Yes let's go. Get up! - Who is it? - Where were you? Today you got married, in that happiness I had 2 bottles more. I didn't realize when I went under the bed. I just woke up. Good you woke up. Had you woken up after 1/2 hour... ...Mary would throw both of us out! - Come on. - Is something going to happen? Marriage was in the morning. What happens in the night is not your concern. Great! I felt you kept these flowers for me. Not for you. You sleep outside. It will rain outside. You both sleep here... Wait! Get out! Mary... come. Everything... is ready... over here. No... I'm fine here. Come here. What are these books for? This... is that. That. Okay that! Books for the wedding night? Let me see. Any photos? This is a different book. - This isn't that book. - Then? It's an ABCD book. No. Not ABCD. Newly married couples must study something else. Not now. - What? - You forgot how father insulted you in the church. He said many things in the church. Forget it now. You don't care for your respect but I do! I decided in the church to teach you to read and write. We'll start the lesson. Say A for apple. Say. What? Do I have to learn this lesson now? Yes. You'll learn this lesson now. What I'm saying is, in the morning at 6 a.m.... ...if we start with a fresh mind. Won't it be good? We can start even now with a fresh mind. Okay not 6 a.m. we'll start at 3 a.m. Okay give me just one hour. Then see how I... How fast I... If you really love me, start learning now. Come on say! Say in words. - Child means? - It means a baby. After apple and bed, how can a baby come? I won't say. You laughed! It means even you like babies. It's okay. - Get up. - No, it's nice here. I'll learn from here. Get up! Now say. What's wrong? How did your voice change? I've got a sore throat because of you. Have some shame else... Means? It means, I will beat you. Where did you learn this English? I see it in movies, I learnt it from there. You've learnt what is not needed. You don't teach what I want! Leave this and say D for darkness. - Darkness means? - Darkness means unlit. - Unlit? - Yes. Yes unlit. This is right. Apple and bed are here. Child will come later. I'll unlit the room now. What are you doing? Get up. - I won't speak to you. - I won't listen to you! First is studies. First studies, then love will happen. Not once but a hundred times. Yes it will happen. I will not be able to wait. We'll learn today's lesson now. That's okay but when will you have time for me? In the world, the best thing is... a couch. The moon rises at a certain time, the sun sets at a certain time. We too must work at fixed times. That's fine but when will you have time for me? This is the first flower... ...which blooms at night. The sad thing is... ...men are not timely. Important things must be done first. As a servant of God, it's my duty... ...to hear your confession and request God to forgive you. Tell me. Tell me what sin have you committed? I haven't done any sin till now. But now I'm going to do 3 murders. People come here to confess and get forgiveness for their sins. But you're talking about the sin, you're going to commit. I didn't understand this. I don't wish that after committing a sin... ...my feet should stain this holy place. I'm innocent now. But after today, I'll never come here. Listen to me. If you kill a human being, God will never forgive you. I'm not going to kill a human. I'm going to remove the traces of three beasts from this world. At such a time... ...the call of my soul is more intense than my religious duty. I'm sure God will forgive me. As per the religious order, I must not see the face of the confessor. So I haven't seen your face till now. You're going to do a sin. I wish to talk to you in my room. Come with me. Mahesh Sandal? He lived here 24 years back? The house at the end of this lane, with a national flag, a man... ... lives there since 20 years. He has never progressed. Ask him. - Is this Mahesh Sandilya's house? - Yes. The person I'm talking about... ... used to do liquor business 24 years back. That's how he has such a big house. I'm a retired Collector. I couldn't even make a hut for myself. I wander on the streets. I'm Sandilya speaking. What? This isn't a fire station. You maybe trying since long, but that's not my concern. What? I've to hoist the flag on 15th August in a school? There's a problem. I'm going to Singapore on the 15th for shopping. I told you this is not a fire station! What? The fire is still burning? The fire will extinguish when it'll rain in the evening. Go and rest. Who is that? When did you come from jail? It's been so long since I saw you. I was in jail for 24 years. You didn't have time to see me for even a day. Today, when I've come here looking for you... ... you're exhibiting love. David, the work load was too much. Not work... the money has increased. In our country there is, what you call democracy... ... due to which a loafer like me got lucky to cheat and come up. You didn't bother to know my condition in jail. But... ... I'm happy to see your advancement. If I sit here, will your sofa become dirty? What are you saying David? Sit down. This sofa has no value before you! So what if I'm rich? This liquor vendor... I mean this building contractor, Sandilya... ... can give his life, for his best friend. Thank you. Where is he? What a fool I am! I didn't ask what you'll drink. Or you'll directly have breakfast. It's not vital for me to satisfy hunger. lt's more essential to satisfy my heart. Where is he? I was saying... he's gone out. And it can take him 3-4 hours to return. In that time, you can have a wash, put some talc and become fresh. This is the problem with you. You're very stubborn. Take a wash and get ready. Come... very good! This is my imported bath room. It's made keeping in mind some art. Actually... - Long live... - The worker's union! - Give the worker's... - Bonus! - Long live... - The worker's union! - Give the worker's... - Bonus! - Long live... - The worker's union! Our only leader... brother Chaturvediji! The voice of the poor... brother Chaturvediji! The symbol of revolution... brother Chaturvediji! In our great leader's path, if anyone creates hurdles... ... we will... we will crush him! And we want to warn our enemies... ... if anyone even touches our great leader... ... we'll cut his head off! We know only one leader, we take only one as our leader. His name is Chaturvedi! So friends, now before you, brother... - What's your name? - Sadanand. Yes, brother Sadanandji will express his thoughts. Come Sadanandji. He wasn't letting me speak. Brothers and sisters. Friends and colleagues... - What is it? - Mary sister is having labor pains. Come on. Are you crazy? How can I leave this hunger strike and come? Take Mary to the hospital, I'll finish this meeting and come. What are you saying? Even when your mother died, you were behind this leader. Now your wife is in labor and you say, you'll come later! This strike is more dear or your wife! Try to understand. My leader will be insulted if I leave this strike and go. You are yelling and doing a hunger strike here... ... but where is your leader? - Greetings leader. - Greetings. Is any important person waiting for me outside? - The regular visitor's have come. - Okay. David is here to name his child. Who is this David? - Once when police had arrested you in Former's Revolt.- Yes. To free you he was ready to burn and die! - Okay. - Sir, he's the same David. So what? There are so many men... ... who are ready to die for a great leader like me. How many should I remember? David is an important man, he's ready to do anything for you. Okay fine. When we go out, let me know who David is. If I embrace the wrong man, it'll be a awkward. I don't like you to be a stooge. The child is your's, why should the leader keep his name? You could ask me. I'd give him a nice name like... ... Pandu, Pundu or Chandu. - Shut up! - You shut up! You're here since morning but no one asked you for even a tea. Did anyone ask you to sit inside? - You're right brother. - You too can add your comments. I'll do your steel perm it work but my nephew will meet you. - Fine. - Okay then. Okay listen... - Who is she? - She's David's wife... Mary. Fool! We could meet these men later We should have met David first. Leader... great leader! - How are you? - I'm fine. Come. I know everything about you. You don't need to tell me. Why have you come here? Leader, this is my son. We want you to keep his name. If you can... As per your religion, you should take him to the church... ... or ask some big man to keep his name. No leader! For us you are like our God! No... I'm not such a great man. - You must have thought some name for him. - No we... - I like the name James. - Keep quiet! James is a good name. Yes. It's a nice name. Please give him to me. Come James. Come. May God give him a long life. Please wait. Why are you giving this? Sir, you are very generous. You're great! This is nothing. You do so much for me. - No Sir... - Take him home, he must be hungry. Ask the mother to give him milk. No need for this. Okay Sir. Come on. What do you want? Nothing? Okay go. Leader, David's wife is very beautiful. Isn't she? Do you know, why I slapped you? - I know. - Why? So you slapped me when I said his wife is beautiful. - No. - Then? Because you told me this very late. - What? - Yes. Ask David to start the tomorrow Rail Obstruction Movement'. Give any reason. But how will we benefit from it? Not we... only I will benefit. - Listen. - The police has arrested your husband. And you want me to get him released. Isn't it? Yes. Don't get scared. I called the police station a little while ago. With in 10 minutes you'll be able to speak to him. - Bansi? - Yes Sir? The child must be hungry. Give him some milk or horlicks. Take him. - Please give me the baby. - First my husband... Don't worry. For us it's common to face the police atrocities. Don't worry. The phone is ringing. It must be your husband. Go and speak to your husband. Take the baby. Please give me the baby. Please go. Yes Sir? See that the baby doesn't call the mother for 1 hour. Understood? I'm Mary speaking! Rogue! Don't you have a mother or sister! You will ask this. Isn't it? You cruel man! My husband is ready to die for you... And you have an evil eye for his wife! You'll ask this. Isn't it? I agree... it's a very bad thing. But what can I do? Except my wife, I find everyone's wife beautiful. What can I do? No... no! Are you thinking of screaming? Do you think, Lord Krishna will come to save you? He existed in the golden ages but he doesn't exist now. Come... No! No! Come... Why are you crying? I wasn't jailed for theft or crime. I was jailed for my party. For my great leader I'm ready to die a hundred times. I'll do anything for... So many people at my place? - Come inspector. - Congratulations! Where are you going? You can't go in! Leave me! Inside! You rogue! I'll kill you! You killed my wife! I won't let you live! - I'll kill you! - You're trying to kill him before a police inspector! How dare you! Sir, this rogue killed my wife! Yes Sir, he raped her so she committed suicide! He killed my wife, I'll kill him! Leave him! Sit down and listen to me! Speak to me! How do you know that he killed your wife? Do you have any witness or proof? Yes Sir, I have proof! See this, in this letter my wife wrote what he did! Okay I'll see it. All of you, please go down. See this Sir. My wife wrote it. This rogue killed my wife! He raped her! He killed her, Sir! I used to save money to buy garlands for him! I used to be awake whole night to stick his posters on the wall! Like a dog I obeyed his every command and he raped my wife! Sir I won't leave him! Arrest me but I won't leave him! Arrest this man! I have Rs. 10 lakh in my safe against a contract. Take it! I love the law more than your 10 lakh rupees! You're right Sir, don't spare him. Okay fine, I'll take care of it. You be quiet now! - Do you trust me? - Yes Sir but... Come with me if you trust me and keep quiet! Be quiet and come with me! - Everything will be fine, come with me. - He's dangerous! Sit down! This one proof is enough to get him death penalty! Sign here. I'll write the report later. Do you know to sign? I was illiterate before. Mary taught me to sign! I'll expose that rogue! - Sir, Mary died! - Don't worry, sign here. Sir, Mary was my life. Very good. Remove his handcuffs. What are you doing? Remove soon! Hurry up! Thank you very much! Be thankful, the dead woman's statement came in my hands. If someone else would get it... ... no one could save you from death penalty. Yes. Tear it immediately! You rogues! Scoundrels! Rascals! Forget him. You tear it! - Can't I do that much for you? - You will. A helpless man is trapped in your web... ... you want to take advantage of him and tear this letter! I won't let this happen! - You're right Sir. Don't let these rogues tear the letter! - Yes. - Don't let them tear it. - Yes I won't let them! Give that letter to me! Did you forget the amount of money I gave for you nursing home? - Shut up! - What? You can't do anything you like! Give this letter to a honest inspector and get him arrested. They are very dangerous. Don't spare them! This letter is the only proof you have. Isn't it? Yes Sir. Only with this letter, these two can get convicted. Yes Sir! So it should not be torn. Something else should be done. Very good Doctor! Mr. Mahesh Sandilya, who sells liquor has given a statement... ... that when Mary died, David was in police custody... ... and he did David's bail. But in police records there is no mention of David's arrest. And there's no witness too. - No! He's lying... he's lying! - Sit down. Apart from this, when I arrested him... ... he accepted his crime before 2 rich and responsible men. He wrote that statement himself and gave it to me. I've submitted it in the court. As a doctor, who has done the post mortem of Mary's corpse... ... it's my duty to give an honest statement. The cause of Mary's death was not an accidentor suicide. In fact she was murdered with cruelty. The wounds on her body, are a proof of this. Mary was an educated girl, from a rich family. David was not worthy of her. So she began having extra marital affairs. David confided one day, he can't bear her adultery. I advised him to speak to Mary and ask her to be faithful. But... I never thought he would kill her. No husband can bear his wife's adultery. So I... request the court... to have mercy on him. The way people crucified Jesus Christ. I had only heard about it. But today I even saw it. What will happen to him? Don't worry about him. Now he's my son. I'll close the liquor business. I'll not do any bad business now. It's my duty, to make him an honest and nice man like you. It'll be better if you kill him. Instead of the words of Bible... ... the fire of revenge must burn in his heart. Because after 20 years when I'm released... ... I may not have the strength to match the fire in my heart. At that time he'll be my support. He'll be my strength. See Mahesh... If you are my friend... If you like me... ... then make this boy a dangerous criminal. What are you saying? Will any father say this for his son? The one who raped his mother. The people who punished his father with life sentence in jail. If he doesn't take revenge from such rogues, he's not a man. You are right David. You were so happy with your wife and child. Those 3 rogues notonly burnt your happiness... ... but also defamed you! It's my duty to take revenge from those 3 rogues! You want him to be a criminal. I'll make him... ... such a dangerous man, hearing his name people will shiver! I take an oath David! I was playing hide and seek. Breakfast? It's ready... come. Where's the pistol? Please listen to me with a cool mind. Years back few men did a mistake. It's no use of taking revenge now. I mean... it's not good to roam with a pistol. It's my duty to take revenge from those 3 rogues! You want him to be criminal. I'll make him... ... such a dangerous man, hearing his name people will shiver! I take an oath David! A man watching a drama, can only preach. He can't feel the person's pain. Anyway... Where is my son? David... I... This is Ishwarlal and the one who is being beat en inside is Somlal. They are the members of an international gang. Apart from printing false money, they dressed as police officers... ... and loot ed the nearby villages. That's okay but stop Vijay else he might kill that man in anger. Inspector Vijay, please stop! It's the DIG's order. Stop! Please stop! Leave me! I gave your son the love of a mother and father. Only I couldn't give him mother's milk. As that wasn't possible. I gave him everything and made him a police inspector! I thought when you come back, you'll give me a reward! Great! You gave me such a big reward! How could you make him a police officer? Don't you know, that rogue was also a policeman... ... who saved the rascal who raped my wife and my son's mother! Didn't you know... ... that because of a policeman, I spent 24 years in jail! And you made my son a police officer! You had taken an oath! On what basis did you fulfill it? You were angry then. Else can any father wish for his son to be a criminal? I'm a fool to promise you for the sake of friendship! But when I reached home, I realized... ... it's not a sin to do liquor business! But to instill the poison of hatred in a child's life is a sin! I decided to bear your anger but I won't spoil the boy's life! If you want, you can hit me. Else take my shoe and beat me! Didn't my son ever ask in these years about his mother? Tell me! - He asked many times. - What did you say? - I said she died. - Didn't you say how she died? I said she died due to small pox! Why did you lie? I didn't know you'll react like this. Did you tell him, his father is rotting in jail for 24 years? - Did you? - No! - Why? I told him, I'm his father! You... You said that you... ... you're his father. Don't feel bad. I'll tell you the truth... He called me Baba, and those were his first words. I'm not his father but I was very happy to hear Baba. I became his father from that day. For his sake I left all bad habits. God also helped me. I educated him but never told him your story! Because I knew he'll get enraged. So I never came to see you in jail. I beg of you! Please don't ever tell him that I'm not his father! Don't take him away from me! To brighten my life, I asked you to light a lamp. But you burnt me and brightened your life. Okay... You can keep your son. These old bones are still strong. To achieve my goal, I don't need you or your son! Where is the pistol? You've come after so many years. Atleast see your son once. You'll forget the revenge. I forgive you today... But don't expect such decency from me again. If you ever try to arouse the emotion of a father in me... ... my first victim will be my son... Sorry, will be your son. I have given you birth. You are my image. I have given you birth, you are my image. My blood flows in your veins. You're my image. You're the saga of mother's love. You're the symbol of father's love. Take care of us. Bring glory to our family. Do the duty of a son... ... repay what you owe to your mother. I have given you birth. You are my image. He doesn't have my blood. He is not the symbol of your love. He's neither your image... nor mine. What sin have you done? I haven't done any sin yet. But now... I'll do 3 murders. Hey girl! Can't you see the no-entry sign? I see it everyday. Then why did you enter the no-entry zone? I was in a hurry. First pay Rs. 100 fine then you can go in hurry. Your name? Age? - What do you do? - Love. - Father's name? - Mr. S.K Bhatnagar. - What does he do? - He's a DIG. Means? Put your hand down. Your name? Tell me your name. Father's name? It means all are Khote, no one is Khara. Okay. If I give this to my father, you know what will happen? I'll never do this mistake again. If I come this way again, what will you do? I'll reverse the no-entry sign. What are you doing? My name is Vijay. I'm a CID officer. Give my complaint to your father. I don't care. I've just deflated the tyre. If you enter a no-entry zone again, I'll give the tyre in your hands. Come on... move. See the mistake, not at the person who does it. Understood? Sir, you're in the photographs. Are you lovers? Your pair is nice. - Listen to me. - I don't want to hear anything. In the excitement to show you the photos... And you couldn't keep from showing off your post! You insulted me before everyone! You did a mistake so as a police officer I had to shout at you. But here I'm your lover. You can shout at me or give me any punishment. If you say I'll beg at your feet or if you say I'll kiss you. Don't come behind me. Go to your constable and kiss what you want! The lovers are made for each other.' The love story has begun. There goes my heroine with my heart. I don't want it. Don't stop me, don't interrupt me. Don't look at me. Don't touch me. Don't force me. No villain must come in our love story. No hurdle must come in our love. Love is enhanced by gazing at each other. The love story has begun. There goes my heroine, with my heart. Recall the scenes they show in the movies. They lie down and talk. They run and sing. I ran behind you, you ran before me. The love story has begun. There goes my hero, stealing my heart. The lovers belong to each other. The love story has begun. There go the hero and heroine, stealing each other's heart. - Speak up! - Don't hit us Sir. - Where have you hidden it? - Don't hit us Sir. Take out the goods! This is a sacred place. You can't dig a grave without permission! What's the meaning of this? It means you all are irresponsible! That's enough! How many times will you kiss your baby? After he's born, I'll give him lot of love. How can you say it'll be a boy? Because you love me much more than I love you. He will be just like me. Only in one way he'll be like me. - In what way? - In speaking English. You've just learnt English. He'll cry and talk in English from childhood. You can't compete with him. Okay fine, ask him to speak to me. - How can he talk now? - Why? Let the day come when both of you will speak in English. Then we'll see who wins. You were right Mary. Your son speaks English so fluently. But... I'm not less than him. I'll go and talk to him in English. I'll surpass him. They are waiting since long to bury the corpse. You are screaming so loudly, they are not able to pray. I'm doing my work, let them do theirs! Constable! Take him in the jeep! Dare you do that! Beware if you touch him! Why must we keep quiet? My brother is a lawyer. I too know the law. Please calm down. He's a child and spoke in the spirit of his youth. I'll explain to him. Please go. The dream you had seen for your son... ... it's come true. I wish... I wish you could see all this. You would be so happy. Take him away. Come on! The time of your child hood... ... don't forget, remember it. You're the support of my old age. You're the treasure of my hopes. Do all my work... ... glorify my name. You have got my name. You are my image. I've given you birth. You are my image. My blood is in your veins. You are my image. Think once more and then answer. When that man confessed to you... ... that he'll murder 3 men. Didn't you feel like seeing his face? Sir, I'm a catholic priest. We're not permitted to see the face of the confessor. We can't even disclose the confession. Then why are you disclosing it? I felt it's more eminent to save the lives of 3 men. So I resigned from priesthood and came here. Now it's your duty to save their lives. You don't know that man's description. You don't even know the men he's going to kill. Without knowing this, what can the police do? Police is not God to know everything. You are absolutely right. This is like catching a black cat in the dark. It's better to drop this case. Isn't it? Father, you can go. Don't make haste. Think... think something. From his confession we know, he is a staunch Catholic. So he must have had the faith that... ... Father won't tell anyone about his confession. That's fine. But knowing this doesn't help us. You're right. That's the reason I didn't discuss this point. I mean I didn't raise this point. Yes son, tell me how will it help. It will help in a way that through newspapers and T.V... ... we can say, Father notonly disclosed his confession... ... but also gave his description to the police. There will be chaos in the city. Every man has some enemy. The whole city will demand for police protection! It'll create a panic! You're right but we will benefit in two ways. When he'll know that... ... Father has disclosed his confession to the police... ... he may attack Father, in a religious fervor. If he does that we can arrest him easily. And if doesn't do that then... ... after knowing that police is aware of his intentions... ... he may delay his plan to kill and we'll get some more time. Your idea is great! I've told you so many times not to intrude in the department matters. Go inside! I feel your suggestion is right. Even I had thought about this. Yes. Mr. Vijay, I feel you can start the investigation. - Yes. - Shall we go? - Yes. If you find any suspicious man near the church... ... don't start the inquiry, first let me know. The plain clothed Constables near the Father's house... ... who are looking at girls passing by, ask them to be alert. Ask Father to come and sit outside. If he sits inside, how will anyone attack him? Assure him, we have taken measures for his safety. He doesn't need to fear. The inspector of Chembur police station has called you at once. - Why? - He says, a Father is there... ... who claims to know everything about the 3 murders that may happen. Did the Father say anything about it to the inspector? No. He says he'll tell the details to the Superintendent of Police. And he insists that he should be taken to the S.P. Ask him to wait, I'm coming. I'm handling this case, so tell me what you know about the criminal. I told the inspector before you... I'll tell the details only to the Superintendent of Police. That's fine, but I should know how much the S.P. should know. No... no. Just a minute Father. Why are you insisting on meeting the S.P. Because in this case some of the police officers are also involved. Maybe they will try to help the criminal. The police convicts the criminals, they don't help them. In your age I too had faith in this belief. But I was betrayed. Anyway, will I get the permission to meet the S.P.? Please wait here. Inspector Vijay is handling this case. We have faith in him. You can tell him everything. Even I wanted Vijay to know everything but... ... but later I thought, I'll tell you everything myself. If you permit, I'd like to search him. Let him do his duty. You said he's a very sincere officer. Why this bandage? This is an old wound. It's not healed yet. Why don't you go to a specialist? There are 3 specialists in my mind. With great difficulty I've got an appointment with the first one. In the morning a file had come from the DIG's office. This one, did you see it? Yes... I saw it. Now tell me, who is this criminal and who is he going to kill? When is he going to kill them and why? It'll take me time to tell the details so... ... I've written everything about that criminal on this paper. Please read this. Yes the same David. He had a beautiful wife, a lovely child. He had a happy family. You destroyed everything! David, I'm not that old Sahay. I've changed. I've improved. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. It's humane to forgive an enemy... ... but to forgive traitor is foolishness! Remove your clothes. - Clothes? - Yes. I won't let you die in this uniform. This uniform has a respect. It will be maligned if it gets stained with your blood. I'm com ing there in some time, till then I want everyone to be alert. You have a call. Tell I'm busy. Ask them to call after 1/2 hour. Some Vinita has met with an accident. She's very serious. Vijay speaking. Vinita has met with an accident. She's serious. You're calling from which hospital? which hospital? Say she's lying on the road. She's lying on the road. She wants to die in your arms. She wants to die in your arms. I'm upset to see tears in your eyes. But for 24 years I've shed tears of blood in the darkness. You have to pay for that. Don't you? I won't kill you with my hands. You're a corrupt police officer. An honest police officer will come and open this door. And he'll be the cause of your death. Behave sensibly! Yes start that. This will be a lesson for corrupt police officers like you! No... no! Wasn't it a great jump? I was so proud of you. I used to give your example to senior officers and... ... asked them to emulate your sense of duty. I didn't you to be so careless and foolish. I've been in the service for 24 years... ... and next year I'll retire. It's another thing that in these years I didn't solve any case. But in I never did such foolishness. Am I right? You said, you went in the control room and... ... opened the channel to Sahay's room. That man spoke to him for 10 minutes before the murder. Why didn't you open that channel before? What were you doing? In what work were you busy? Tell me! This is your first mistake and I hope it's your last mistake. Please forgive me. Because of my foolishness, people are blaming you. I'm upset to see tears in your eyes. But for 24 years I've shed tears of blood in darkness. You have to pay for that. Don't you? But for 24 years I've shed tears of blood in darkness. You have to pay for that. But for 24 years I've shed tears of blood in the darkness. As you asked - between 20th and 24th July, 3 men were released. Are you sure, this is the criminal. Yes Sir, his name is David. He was imprisoned for murdering his wife. Three men gave witness against him in the court. He confessed to murder these 3 in the church. Superintendent of Police, Mr. Sahay was his first victim. The details of the case are in the file. Mr. Vijay, when you become old you'll look like David. Senior officers like you can only debate. Junior officer Vijay, has brought so many details with hard work... ... and you're making fun of him! This criminals next target is Dr. Verma and minister Chaturvedi. Chaturvediji has gone abroad and will be back after 10-15 days. Find out where Dr. Verma is. Make arrangements for his protection. Dr. Verma will be coming. I'll set your meeting with him when he comes. Please sit. - Is Doctor in? - He's coming. Please sit. The list is very long, I can't see so many patients. Send the important patients inside. Listen! You can go in. Madam, you may be the DIG's daughter, but you can't park here. Park the bike behind. Do you know how valuable his daughter is? It's now known who is S.P Sahay's murderer. - His name is David. - Today's latest news! S.P Sahay's murderer is revealed! David was released a few days back. Police suspects that David's next victim can be Dr. Verma. So he has been kept at unknown place in police protection. What's wrong with him? Sir, as soon as I told him... ... that he can be David's next victim, he fainted. So I thought that... Someone wants to speak to DIG and says he is David. Sir... David wants to speak to you. That criminal. Should I talk? Trace this call. I'm the DIG speaking. When I came in broad daylight to murder S.P. Sahay... ... you took me very carefully to his office. Did they make you a DIG for that intelligence? What nonsense! This is what I was telling you. Give the phone to DIG. What's the matter? He recognized my voice. He wants to talk to you. What do you want? Yes... yes. - Yes? - I've asked Pandey to trace the call. - Yes. But when I was talking... ... I could hear the sound of local train and church bells. Scan the area which has a Church near the railway line. Police is not scared of your blackmail. We don't care who you have kidnapped. Don't make a decision so soon. First know who is in my custody. Decide after that. You? Are you fine Vinita? Please save me father! I don't know where I am! I'm scared of this man! He'll kill me! Old man, give me the phone else I'll start screaming. Help... help! Don't be scared DIG. I showed her the knife so she has kept quiet. So... let's talk business. When and where will you hand over the Doctor to me? You'll tell me the time and place or should I say it? David, you can't escape us. Surrender yourself to the law else... See, I only want an answer to my question. The Doctor's life is dear to you or your daughter's? Policemen don't bother for relations or love. If anything happens to my daughter I'll consider it my ill fate. But I won't hand the Doctor to you. You can do what you want! You made a little haste. We could take a chance. We should have found out which place he wants to meet the Doctor. I'm sure there could be a break through. We did a publicity in papers and on T.V. that... ... we' re keeping the Doctor at a place which no one knows! The funny thing is I'm hardly here for 10 minutes and he calls me! Doesn't it prove he's more intelligent, more smarter than us! I can't trust you and risk a person's life! Even if I've to sacrifice my daughter's life for that. Please let me take the call. I don't want you to compromise because of Vinita! I'm not compromising! I'm only doing my duty as a police officer! We're ready to give you the Doctor. But we want time till tomorrow. Why? Isn't today's day auspicious? I know you're an intelligent police officer. While talking to me, you heard the sound of the local train. You may have sent your men near the railway lines to look for me. You are a fool. I was the driver of that train. I'll start the train again. Listen. You heard? Listen, one more thing. Before midnight today... ... wherever you have hidden the Doctor... ... in your presence I'll kill him! Save him if you can! As per your instructions, I've sent my men... ... near all the railway lines in the city. He'll be caught in an hour or so. Definitely he'll be caught! Listen... you have reached the old age. You've seen everything in life, but I'm still a child. I've not seen anything yet. I've to get married... ... I've to be a mother of 10 children. Please leave me. Please stop! I'm talking and you're not saying anything! Leaving me alone here, where are you going? I'm feeling hot here. I haven't eaten anything since afternoon! - What will you have? - What? What will you have? I want ice-cream. He's gone. I won't get ice-cream. Okay. I'll eat what I get. Send more men on the Hotel's terrace. - You called me? - Yes. How will our men recognize the room service waiters? We've given them identity cards. - Go in the parking lot. - Okay. Remove all the men except the drivers. Put some more Constables there. - How many men are on the staircase? - 10 men. Okay, you be near the lift. We may take all the precautions, but David won't spare him. Doctor will die. DIG and inspector Vijay will lose their jobs. - Catch this. - No! If we kill him, what will happen to Vijay? Catch the rope. No! If I'm my father's son, I'll never catch it! Try to climb up! He... Who is he? Who is he? When a young girl keeps the photo of a young man... ... it means she wants to marry him. Don't you know that much? It's bleeding. My father is a policeman, but he never hit me till today. I would do any mistake but my mother never screamed at me. And... and he is so hot tempered. He talks with his hands! But even he never... And... and this blood. This old man... No... you are notold. Daughter... Daughter? Take... wipe the blood. No... you cared that's enough. Enough. Is it paining? I also hit you. Is it paining badly? No? But I hit very hard. You said you were hungry. Didn't you? - This... - Is this for me? - Yes. - I thought you were joking. It means even you have a heart. How many days will you keep me here? Till the time you don't eat this. Can I go home and eat? Eat it here, child. No... I'll go home and eat. Okay... go. Will you take me outside and kill me? No child... come. Come. It's very late and the way is lonely. Keep this with you. How did you change suddenly? I didn't understand it. Don't try to understand anything. Consider our meeting as a bad dream and forget it. You're setting me free. After I reach home, father and Vijay will ask me... ... about the place where you kept me. But I won't tell anything. Why do you trust me so much? Please tell me, why do you trust me so much? Suppose, God forbid if someone rapes you. What will you do? Answer me, what will you do? If possible, I'll kill him. And if not, I'll commit suicide. My wife has committed suicide. I'm doing the duty of killing them. If you feel, what I'm doing is justified... ... then don't tell them anything. Else do what you feel is right. He's a murderer! It's my duty to arrest him! Till I'm working in this department... ... there can be no relation between me and the killer! When he threw the rope to save me, I was as surprised as you are! He tried to save your life as you're his best friends son. You had given me David's case file. We only looked at those witnesses who gave a testimony against David. But today in the morning when I read this file again... ... I noticed a witness who gave the testimony in favor of David. And that man was country liquor vendor, Mahesh Sandilya. That's your father. After being released, David inquired about your father... ... found him out and met him. A retired Collector is an eye-witness to this. I know what you're trying to say. Don't forget, you're keeping a watch on Mahesh Sandilya... ... not on your father. You've come. Are you fine? Did David give you any problem? He's not an insensitive man like my father and your son. They had left me to die. But David gave a pistol for my protection and sent me back. He's a very nice man, a saint. He's a very nice man, I know it since a long time. Today even you know it. No one understands him. Okay tell me what will you have? Something hot or... Why are you staring like that? How do you know David is a nice man? I said it because he sent you back safely. He sent me back today but you said you know him since long. - Did I say that? - Yes. You've put me in a dilemma. Don't try to avoid it. How do you know David? Let it be... don't ask anything else. If I'm trapped once, I won't be able to escape. I'm going. Oh my God. He too had to come now. This is a talk between us, we'll do it later. If Vijay asks you about David, don't tell him anything. Keep quiet... like this. My dear son, how are you? And tell me how... Poor thing escaped from that killer and has just arrived. She's very scared, she can't even talk. She's only saying daddy... daddy. Come child, I'll leave you home. How did you reach here? I'm asking you, how did you reach here? I don't need to answer your questions. A killer held me captive for the whole night. You and father made no effort to save me. In fact you left me to die. Now I've come here, you're asking how I reached here, not how I am! I'm sorry I didn't try to save you last night. Now answer my query. I told you, she duped David and ran away. He has fooled the entire police force and she'll dupe him! Okay then think that he himself left her here. She has reached home safely, we don't want anything else. Will you keep quiet? Come here. Sit. Listen Vinita. You know, my duty is more important to me than relations. I've was humilliated because of you once. Help me to catch that crook. Where did David hide you? It's very hot, should I put on the fan? Listen Vinita... Your answer can save a man's life. Tell me, where did he keep you? You're questioning a hungry girl... Not father, daddy or Baba. You're calling me by name! You're my son! Right now I'm a police officer, please go now! Tell me! Where did he take you? I don't know. Wherever he took me, he blindfolded me. And when he left me, I was blindfolded even then. You are lying! He may or may not have blindfolded you but you've decided to fool me! Good the trouble has gone. I'm saved! Thank God! If eared you may come under his pressure and tell the truth. But you acted very well. great! I was acting but now you don't act before me. Tell the truth. Who is David? I'm trapped! Tell me uncle. - David is not my son! - What nonsense! Nonsense? I've had one peg only. If I have a second peg, I'll talk better. Now I'll say the truth. Your lover Vijay... ... he's not my son! He's David's son! He tried to save your life as you're his best friend's son. After being released from jail, he inquired about your father... ... found him and met him at your home! Mr. Vijay when you become old... ... you'll look like this killer David. This is not the fire station! Everyone's after me! David you? Have you gone mad? Is this the time to come here? Vijay must be coming. Before you he'll shoot me! Why have you come here? Tell me! Listen. You may not bother about your life. But Vijay values his respect! Think about it, Vijay is a famous police officer. It'll be disastrous for him to know... ... Mahesh Sandilya who brought him up, is not his father! You're his father! If he knows about his father... ... he's ask about his mother! We'll have to tell him the second secret. Will you be able to tell your son... ... that his mother died because she was raped! And when he'll know that he was protecting the rogues... ... who raped his mother and sent his father to jail... ... he'll be devastated! Listen David... ... Vijay is not my son. But I've given him more love than one can give his own son! Even he loves me very much. If knows this bitter truth, he'll leave me and go away! I'll open the door, you leave before Vijay comes here. Don't go from here! I'll open the other door. Go from here! David where are you... Why are you crying? Understood. You've changed after what I said. You've improved. Isn't it? You want to surrender for the sake of Vijay's future. Isn't it? Don't worry. In the past it was different. Your friend didn't have the money. But today I have money! I'll fight your case well. Wait here, I'll talk to the police. Inspector, you're not arresting David. He's surrendering himself. So you must treat him with respect. Tell this to Vijay also! No need to shake my hands. It's my duty as a police officer's father. What's this? You knew everything about the criminal but... ... till 2 murders you gave no information to the police. To know more about this, you're arrested. Why arrest the witness? Arrest the culprit. He's... Come on Sir. One minute. I want to speak to my son, no to Inspector Vijay in private. I loved you so much... ... so much that my heart became empty. And you played this game with me. The elders were right. A man's real son is his own. Someone else's son can not be our own. Why have you come here? What have you come, here for? That day, when you realized, who I am, you let me go. Today, when I realized, who you are, I came here. Your old friend Mahesh told me everything about you. You stood as my father-in-law during the marriage ceremony. For you to bless me or for me to invite you to my house... ... Perhaps it's not in our destiny. That's why I have come here with food, today. Please come and have food! Perhaps, your sorrows have overcome you appetite. Still, eat a little to make me happy. For me! What is this? Resignation? You think, a resignation could stop an officer from arresting your dad? Had it been about arresting my father, I wouldn't have resigned. I am still ready to arrest him. But, I am not ready to protect a savage who raped my mother. Being her husband, he could at least take revenge on two brutes! Being her son, I'll take revenge on the third. How could a responsible officer like you, talk like that? A true police officer, loves his duty more than his relations. You know this very well! Yes, sir! I know it! But, being a police officer doesn't mean that... ... I forget the atrocities done to a mother, who bore me in her womb. Do I forget the excesses done to my innocent father in the name of law? He was nothing to me, yet he loved me, more than one loves a son. I got both a father and mother's love! What did I give him in return? Betrayal in the name of duty! Children consign their deceased parents to the holy fire. By arresting him, I set his love afire in his own life time. I can't agonize myself, by being so daft as to protect law. To defame the whole department due to one man's fault, is not right. When, one mentions India, one talks of Gandhi, not Godse. I am not saying, a police officer should be heartless or emotion less. But they should use their heart and emotion for benefit of the public. And not be revengeful to the public. Ashoka's pillar is our national symbol. And the pride to wear this symbol on one's head... ... belongs only to a soldier or a police man who protects law. Even the president and the prime minister don't have this privilege. Don't disown this pride with this resignation. Think it over once more and then make a decision. I feel ashamed to call myself your son. I couldn't wipe of the blemish against your name. Perhaps, you are ill-fated to have a son like me. It's you good fortune that you got a husband who loved you so much. I am proud of my father. I feel a lot of pride for him. But, I have to abide by my duty. Forgive, me mother! I have to abide by my duty. A man can share his happiness with anyone. But his sorrow, he has to contain in his own heart. That's the reason, I have never told you the truth. Since, I didn't want to share my agony with you. It's good that you came here, today! Today, it's your mother's anniversary. Let's pray, so that her soul may rest in peace. Come on, let's pray first! We can discuss things later. Take this and light it! The prayer, is important, not the way you do it! I have reached the end of my life's road. Neither, do I need anyone's help, nor good wishes. But your son has his whole life ahead of him. Therefore, you save all your good wishes for him. He'll need them. Look at this! It must look like 6 from there. But, from here, it appears 9 to me. Difference is, because, you look at it from your place, I, from mine. We are right in our different situations. Just that we have different viewpoints. This difference between us, would last all our lives. You do, what you think is your duty. And, I'll do, what ever I think is right! If I win, you'll be proud of your father. In case you win, I'll too, be proud of my son. But... But my soul won't rest in peace! But, son, I know this won't happen! Not, because you are my father... ... but as a police officer, too, I believe, you are right in a way. Therefore, I am ready to get the last criminal, convicted. The law that allowed those criminals to roam free, till now... ... that law talks about convicting them, today? I am sorry, but these things have no meaning for me. Henceforth, my son, you need not bother the trouble. I'll decide his conviction, myself! Being a police officer I can't let a criminal, walk away. Surrender yourself to me! A man with courage dares to catch his fish in a storm in the ocean. The one who, sits at the shore and dangles the hook... ... one who waits for the fish to take the bait, is not a brave man. If you are really brave, then come and arrest me at my den. And if you are not, then I am not going to surrender myself. I am leaving. You can shoot me in the back and win rewards and fame. A police officer can shoot anywhere to nab a criminal. It's not important, which part of a criminal's body he shoots at. Never expect me to be lenient to you. A criminal can even murder to save his skin from the police. You shouldn't expect any pity from him. I can kill you, if I want. But, the mother, who bore you in womb for nine months is lying here. I don't want to kill you here. But, remember, your mother can't be everywhere to save you. Hail, brave leader Mr. Chaturvedi! Hail the warrior, Chaturvedi! Forget the old things and remember that you are a police officer. Welcome! Welcome! Your life is in danger! Look at this! - What is this? - Why are you showing it to him? Fool! If my life is in danger, than who organized this welcome, program? Sir, this is the time you can prove your courage. All arrangements for security are in place! Don't worry! David came to your headquarter and killed an S.P and you did nothing. How could you ever save me? I am off to America. If you go, party's prestige will be soiled. Tongues will wag, leader! I don't even belong to this country. I am off. There's nothing to be afraid of. We have a bullet-proof jacket for you. That jacket would save me till here what if he shoots me here? - I am leaving! - People are hailing you, and you are leaving? - I am off! - Stop, leader! - I say I'll leave! Stop the Jeep! Get away! Get away! Get away! We have secured all the man-holes. He won't get away. - You can go home in police jeep. - No! No! Till he's not arrested, I won't budge from here! Tell your people to cover me up! Come, hurry up! I am telling you as an experienced police officer I suggest... ... don't go before him and endanger your life. Just shut up. I want him to use up his bullets. That's why I go! You think just like me! You can't get away. I say, just stop! Don't force me! May god help your soul to rest in peace. Well done! I have no words to praise you. My secretary told me just now that this killer is your father. You didn't get carried away with emotions and did your duty well. What do you say, DIG, am I right? I'll recommend a gold medal for you. Brothers and sisters, this David who lies dead, here... ... was a killer and a dangerous criminal. He was a blot against the name of the country. The way we celebrate Ravan's slaying by lord Rama as Dussehra... ... we will celebrate this demons death. And... If I win, you would be proud of your father.
