U.S. tank detachment Unit 5. Repeat message. U.S. tank detachment Unit 5. Repeat. - Over to you, over. - No code. Retreat has been ordered in all sectors. Surviving units note that points east, west and north... ...are under enemy control. Over to you. I don't understand. To the south? All points east, west and north under enemy control. Okay, but what do we do? What's the order? Good luck to you, Yank. Over to you. What? Good luck to you, Yank. In your own language, scram! Okay. Why didn't you say so in the first place? Hey, sarge! Hey, sarge! Sergeant Gunn! Hurry up, sarge! Orders came through. Hurry up! Okay, keep your shirt on! All right, Waco? Let's go! Hey, sarge! We got to get out of here, and quick! It just came over. East, west and north under enemy control. General retreat ordered. East, west and north. They got us boxed in. That's south, but there's nothing there but sand and rock. Any place is healthier than this. Let's move! Come down here and give us a hand! What'll we do if we can't get this cement mixer rolling? Lay off that cement mixer stuff. Give me that gadget. Get in there. Hold that down while I bolt it. Think she'll pull us out? It depends on the way we handle her. It's like a dame. But no dame ever said anything as sweet... ...as this motor will sound when she gets rolling. Keep that up and they're liable to hit us. There. That ought to hold her. All right, get around. Start it up. He's got a touch like an elephant. He don't feed her enough. It's like a dame. Don't feed them, they won't do nothing. That's no way to treat her. Let me in there. Okay, Joe. She's dead. Five he starts it? You got a bet. Come on now, baby. Get going and get us out of here. I'll buy you the sweetest coat of paint you ever had in your life. Come on now, Lulubelle, let's go. Hatch is up. Sarge, two guys ahead. - What do you make of them? - They look British. It might be a Nazi trick. Remember that phony white flag at Bir Hacheim? I wouldn't bet they were British if they waved a roast beef. Keep them covered till I find out who they are. Master Sergeant Gunn, U.S. Army Tank Detachment. Captain Halliday, Royal Army Medical Corps. Nice to see you. I had 42 wounded there. When the Stukas finished with us, I had 42 dead. These men were kind enough to help search the wreckage. It was no use. What are you looking at? Oh, help yourself. Merci bien. American cigarette, I don't see for a long time. Pass them around. - Talks like a Yank. - How else would I talk? We've been expecting you a long time. Ours was one of the first tanks here. How many men do you have, sergeant? Two. Radioman and machine gunner. I lost the rest of my crew. I suppose you're trying to rejoin your detachment? It's too late. - Too late? - What are you talking about? Haven't you heard? A general retreat's been ordered. That's not true! Listen to that firing. Our chaps are still at it not far away. They're mopping up what's left of them. If we cut south far enough we can hook up with another outfit. You don't know that part of the desert. It's the worst in Libya. You won't get anywhere in that scow. Soon as it's daylight, they'll blast the gizzards out of her. I'm sorry you feel that way about her. A good tank with a full crew has a better chance than men on foot. - That's a matter of opinion. - They'll get you. - We'll get them first. - For what they did to the hospital. I'd sooner stick it out than run away in a tin hearse. There's three things wrong with that statement. First, we're not running, we're obeying orders. Second, she's not made of tin and third, she's no hearse. She's an M3 that can cross 200 miles of desert... ...as easy you'd walk around that Piccadilly Circus of yours. I'm not going to argue with you. Stick around, let the Nazis mop you up. Spend the rest of the war in a Berlin prison camp, but not me. When I go into Berlin, I'll be riding that tank. Same one that's standing there with the name Lulubelle on her. Sergeant! I'll go with you. What makes you want to go? I like your cigarettes. All right. Get inside. I'm sorry I blew up just now, sir. But that crack that guy made about my tank kind of burned me. She's a good tank. I'll tell you again. We got it over the radio. We're surrounded. The only way out is south. That's the way we're going. Good luck, sir. Wait a minute, sergeant! We're coming with you! Hurry up! Here you are, sir. Come on, fellas! It's a peculiar thing. A sergeant is the same in every army in the world. What?! A sergeant's the same in every army in the world! You don't know Joe. He's a smart guy. I don't think the sergeant is a very tender man. I don't think the sergeant is a very tender man. But he named his tank after someone he loves. - Yeah, a horse! - A what? A horse! He loves a horse. Sarge was in the cavalry way back. - The what? - The cavalry! The cavalry. Something wrong? I think I cut the mixture a little too thin, trying to save gas. He's making a mistake, going this direction. The sarge knows what he's doing. Yes, the sergeant's a genius! He's a miracle man. When we run out of water, he strikes a rock like Moses and water falls out. He hits it twice and the water's turned into wine. Suppose we get stuck in this graveyard without any water. Waco, open that hatch, will you? All right, come down for a while. What's the matter, Waco? The motor. Starving you to death, huh? We got to save gas, same as we save water. Sarge, got to grease the wheels. Make it quick, we got to keep moving. Try that radio again, Jimmy. We'll go in a minute. Eat something, and drink 1/3 cup of water. Be sure to measure with the cup. Get anything? Nothing but static and Heil Hitler! No contact, so we don't know where the army will be. At the worst, the line will be anchored at Tobruk. - We should circle like this. - Will our petrol hold out? I figure we got about enough for 160 miles. Water, I'm worried about. I've got to find one of those wells. They call them wells on the map. But most of them are only dried up mudholes full of sand. Wish I could put my feet in a nice big bucket of water. Must be 1000 centigrade in these boots. My throat needs it worse than my feet. - I suffer from corns. - I'm fed up with your feet. So am I. Been fed up with them for years. - Did you finish, Waco? - Not yet. Why you call him Waco? It's a city in Texas. We call it "The City With a Soul." Why? Come to think of it, I never figured why. We got a sign on the biggest building: "City With a Soul." How about another city with a soul? Paris. You from Paris, Frenchie? No, but for every Frenchman, Paris is the soul. La France. All my life I've wanted to go to Paris. Sometime, maybe we'll go there. I'd like to go home. You fellas like to see a photo of a beautiful girl? - She's pretty. What's her name? - Kathy. Very nice. She's a corker. I told you to measure that water in a cup. - I wasn't thinking. - I'll do the thinking for you. Frenchie, bring the canteens to me. We've got our own officer. I'll take my orders from him. I'm glad you brought that up, Williams. I've something to say to the men, sergeant. We've only one purpose. To save ourselves so that we can fight again. We've got to work together and have discipline. Sergeant Gunn was in command when we joined him. He's an experienced soldier... ...and it seems proper to ask him to continue in that capacity. I shall confer with him on the safety and conduct of the expedition... ...but immediate authority will rest with him. My canteen, sergeant. Thank you, sir. Here you are, Frenchie. What do you make of them? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Hey, Waco. Fire shots in front of them. That ought to turn them back into us. That's a British Sudanese with an Italian prisoner. I think he's going to fight us. Give me something white to wave. Make it snappy. It is true, Bimbashi. I thought I'd captured an enemy tank. Where'd you get this prisoner? At Bir Hacheim. A column of many tanks and many machines attacked us there. All my company died in battle. I alone escaped. It was then I captured... ...this man to carry my pack. What is your name? Sergeant Major Tambul. Force Sudanese Battalion. You know this desert? Yes, sergeant. Is it all like this? Yes, all that way... ...worse for tank. Deep sand? And salt marshes. Only one caravan trail. Very old. - Hard to follow. - Where does it lead? To the well at Hassan Barrani. You think you could find it again? I think I can. I will try. Get your pack off and get on top. Jimmy, throw down a ration. The rest get back in place. Waco, start her up. We're moving on right now. Look! Those birds know just when to show up. They can smell death ahead of time. Anybody know what he's babbling? I speak English. Speak very good. Don't leave me here. Take me with you. Sorry, we got no room. I learn English in school in Torino. And I learn Americano from reading the letters. It's the cousin of the uncle of mia moglie. That's my wife, signore. She got an uncle whose cousin live in America... ...and he write all the time. He tell about the big mountain, the big building, the big art. Everything big in America! Waco, wind her up. We're moving on. I show you letter. I got a letter from my wife. She told me she get a letter... ...from the cousin of the uncle. He work now in Pittsburgh, USA. In the steel factory. Maybe he make the steel for this tank in Pittsburgh, USA. And, signore... ...I show you picture. I got no time to look at pictures. He's right. It's stupid to have pity in war. You kill in a fight. Not like this. I know better than you. - I've been fighting them since 1936. - '36? Spain. There's no pity. My wife and bambina. That's my baby. It's a nice picture. You must be very proud of them. I'll see what I can do. I wish you'd change your mind. This man is a prisoner of war. As such, he's entitled to certain rights. We've got to take him. We can't leave him to die. If we asked the men, they'd agree. They'd agree now. What about when they're starving and dying of thirst? You put me in command to look ahead. - This is a matter of a man's life! - You're wrong. It's a matter of the lives of 10 men. We got a long ways to go. We need every crumb of food and drop of water. I'm taking the Sudanese because he's a British soldier. But I won't take on a load of spaghetti! He walked this far, and he can walk back. That's the end of it. What are you waiting for? Wind her up. Okay, Joe. You better get in, Doc. I'm sorry. Don't leave me here to die. I swear, I work for you. I don't drink your water... ...I don't eat your food. Don't leave me here. Stop! Come on. Come on! Hold your fire. Let the blighter have it. I could squash him like a fly. No, let him think we're out of ammunition. Blasted him out of the sky! You men all right down there? Yes, Bimbashi. Tambul, follow me! Doc, come along in case that guy don't speak English. - I'll come with you, Tambul. - Here's your gun! Drop that gun! You heard me, drop it! What'd he say? My German's a little rusty, but I think I got the sense of it. He said we haven't got a chance. He wants us to be his prisoners. Is he crazy? Ask him if he speaks English. He says no. He didn't know Americans were here. A surprise for you, Fritzie. - We saved it for you, special. - Search him. - What's eating him? - He wants someone else to do it. He does, does he? Why? He doesn't want to be touched by an inferior race. Tell him not to worry about his being black. It won't come off on his uniform. Search him. A knife. And this. That's what I thought. What do you make of that, Doc? It says an offer has been made to the British Army. "Raise the white flag and give up your arms. We have proved the British are led by incompetents and idiots." - What's that? - The fall of... ...Tobruk! What's that about Tobruk? He's lying like his blasted F?hrer! I'll teach him to lie! Signore Sergeante! Somebody is hurt. The German, he shoot. Bring him along and pick up that chute. Bring some water. - Where's Halliday? - What happened? Take it easy, fella. We didn't know he was lying there. He's hurt so bad he couldn't speak. Get the first-aid kit, please. Move him into the shade. Very gently. Take it easy. That's it. Did you get him? Don't try to talk now. We'll fix you up, all right. How is he, Doc? He's badly shot but he may pull through. We can't hang around here any longer. - Is it safe to move him? - Yes, if we take it easy. We got to move quickly, after what the German said. Maybe he's right. Doyle, get on that radio. Yes, sarge. What will we do with this prisoner? There is no doubt we have too many in this tank. Here is another mouth that asks for water. I don't mean we can leave him here in this desert to die. My heart is very soft for this Nazi. Let me have a little talk with him. I'll march him behind the hill... ...there. When you're ready to go, I'll come back alone. Corporal, you got a lot to learn. This is a Nazi. Maybe you find out. It's like a mad dog. Maybe. But he's won a lot of prizes. I'd like to turn him over to headquarters. If we can get there ourselves! We'll keep him as long as we can, then see. In the meantime... ...he's in your charge. Thank you. Did you get anything? - The Germans got Tobruk. - I know. Anything else? They're attacking Sidi Barrani. We're still falling back, trying to reform our lines. What are you smiling at? You look like you understood every word he said. Doc, ask him what he was smiling at. He thinks it's funny... ...we want to fight with this curious detachment. Wipe that smile off your puss... ...or I'll knock your teeth through your head. Verstehen? All right, boys, we move on. Every minute we're here, our chance of getting through is less. He may be lying about Germans in the neighborhood, but we can't tell. We've got to go ahead as if it was the truth. - Tambul! - Yes, sergeant. How far are those wells? About 60 to 70 miles. It is there. - How far? - What, sergeant? How far? There, ahead! You will see as we go down this hill. - How is he? - He's pretty bad, sir. What's he saying? Sounds like his girl's name, sir. - Give him some water. - Can't, sir. Not a drop left. Bone dry. It is so in the desert. One season there is cool, clear water, like lakes in the mountains. Another time... ...nothing. Just a lot of sand. What's funny? Just thinking. When we were kids, the biggest treat... ...was to play on the beach in the sand. How far is it to the next well? About 50 miles, sergeant. At the ruins of Bir Acroma. It is south. Hello, Kathy. I miss-- Captain Halliday, sir. Captain Halliday! He keeps talking to his girl, Kathy. He's gone. It's tough. He did it! Let him alone, Stegman. Battle order of the Army. Do not retreat anotherinch. Cairo and Alexandria must be defended. The Army will stand and fight... ...north ofEl Khattara on the El Alamein line. Scattered units are ordered... ...to report to their commands immediately. We need every man and every machine. Report to your commands. Re-form yourlines. Report to your commands. Hurry. That's it ahead, sergeant. Right! Left. You hear that, Joe? She's missing, ain't she? I wonder how much longer she'll keep going. So do I. Clarkson, back there. Maybe he was lucky! There, straight ahead! Bir Acroma! Come on down, guys. Everybody take cover inside. Come on, Jimmy. On your feet! How is it, Jim? Okay, Joe. Where's that well? Somewhere near the building. Inside the wall, sergeant. All right, men. Spread out and look for that well! Stick along with me. Sure took a beating, didn't you, old girl? Bimbashi! The well! The well! Around here. You better go down and look. Send down a bucket. There's still water dripping! - Something to catch it! - It's going to waste. Bring up a couple of cans and rope from the tank. Heads up! Here it comes. Pull it up slowly. Careful! What a beautiful sight. Real water. Easy now. Don't spill a drop. Three swallows for everybody. Three swallows. No more. Here you are, Jimmy. Stegman, take Frenchie's place. Three swallows. Giuseppe! - Three swallows. - Three swallows. For the German. Everybody gets three swallows. Yes, sergeant. We're considering going to this other well. But we must be sure that we'll find enough water there. At Bir Acroma, there has been water in sufficient quantities. But it means going 130 kilometers out of our way. These men need water badly, HerrKapit?n. Your machines may get through without more water... ...but you take a serious risk with the men. Go with Sergeant Krause's advance party. Show them the way to Bir Acroma. The battalion will follow in an hour. We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, sergeant, very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker? It takes its own time. You cannot milk it like a cow. We'll stay until we get all the water we can carry. We got to, but it's tough to waste all that time. Bates, stand by here. Waco, let's clean Lulubelle out. The rest of you, go over your equipment. Stegman, on lookout. That water helped, didn't it? Couldn't have lasted much longer. Keep a sharp lookout, especially toward those hills. If trouble comes, it'll come from there. Watch for planes. Signore. I would like to help you. You know about motors? I was maestro mechanic in Torino. You got a job. Frenchie... ...let the Italian come around here. Let me take your place. No, it isn't necessary. How is it coming? I'm afraid it drops more slowly. You never can tell about these wells. Have a cigarette. Thanks. How long you been in the army? Twenty years. My father and his father before him were soldiers. All my family have been soldiers. My folks were always farmers. You know where Texas is? It must be very far. Yes, sir. I'm going back there when this is finished. - I got married just before I left. - Good. Good? It's better than that. But you fellas feel differently about marrying. The boys were telling me... ...you Mohammedans have as many as 300 wives. The Prophet tells us four wives are sufficient for a true believer. Why four? The Prophet says one wife makes a miserable life... ...because she gets bored. And two wives make a mess of your life also. For they always quarrel and you never know which one is right. And three wives are bad too. Two always take sides against a third. Now, four wives makes real happiness. How? Two and two are company for each other. And the man, he has his rest. It sounds all right. You got four? No, I have only one. What's holding you back? If you had this law in your Texas, would you have four wives? No, my wife wouldn't like that. It is the same with me. My wife, she would not like it. You sure learn things in the army! Yes, we both have much to learn from each other. I understand. That guy Mussolini you got over there, he doesn't? ll Duce, he's a big man. He speaks like a thunderstorm. And you guys believe him? He tells me he knows best. Everywhere, he writes his mottos. On the walls, on the street... So we got him in the brain. We must believe these mottos. What does that mean? Obey. Believe. Work. Obey? Work for what? Not so much now, Signore. But Mussolini say, by and by, everything is going to be all right. He says it's going to be all right. He thinks he's God, don't he? Yeah, he think. But I think maybe... ...Hitler is God... ...and Mussolini is just his prophet. Don't you worry. Someday that guy will blow up and bust. For some people, it's all right to laugh at il Duce. But when you got a wife and baby, it's no good to laugh. My little Giuseppina. Such a small bambina. Eyes, big like this. She's beautiful. Everybody say she look just like me. Well, don't tell her. No, I don't. Sure, I'm going to tell her! How do you spell oasis? O-A-S-I-S. Scientifically, this isn't an oasis. My wife ain't scientific. I'm saying I'm on green grass with palm trees waving overhead. You know you can't post a letter here. I promised her I'd write home every week, if I wasn't dead. Well, I ain't dead. I should write to my mother. What part of South Africa do you come from? A dorp near Kimberley. Dorp? What's that? A village. It's a fine country. There's always a soft breeze blowing across the veldt. Sounds good. But personally, I think I'll stick to Brooklyn. I was born in Sussex, but we moved to a little farm... ...in Yorkshire. I'm from London. I'm from Dublin. What part of the States are you from? No place. Just the Army. In my village, we had the finest cheese. - What kind of cheese? - From my village. Moulin-Merillac. What it's like? A sort of Brie or Camembert? There's no village like mine. There is no cheese like we make. You should have such a meal! You take a knife. Here, you have a little cheese, a little bread. Then you wash your throat with wine. Then a little cheese. And a little onion. Good! A little onion. A little bread, a little wine. A little cheese, a little bread. A little wine, a little onion. A little cheese, a little bread. Lay off! You had enough. I feel better. All this is no more. Six months ago I'm in my village, but I don't know it. There is no cheese! How do you make cheese without milk? How do you make milk without cows? We had fine cows with the brown face and the white neck. The Nazis take these cows. They cut the throat with a knife. There is no more cheese and milk for the children. You were in occupied France six months ago? - Why were you there? - He worked with the underground. I learned from the channel. I have seen 12 people executed. Hostages. The mayor, who has a white beard... ...Madame Michelet was as big like a jelly... ...Monsieur Le Pecq, who teaches the school... ...Rosalie, who has hair like sunshine. I can do nothing. So I'm no good for the underground. Too much hate in my eyes! So I come here. I wish only to kill... ...to pay back for my village! There's something headed this way! See the cloud of dust? Moving fast. German scout car. Keep your eye on them. Keep down so they can't see you. Leroux, get the Italian inside! Bates, bring those canteens back to the tank. The rest of you men take cover. Come on, get in. You speak English? - Coming our way? - Straight for us. All right, watch them. - Where are they? - Behind that hill, coming right at us. Waco and Jim, get behind that ridge. Hold your fire! I want prisoners. The rest of you, keep down. You understand what they say, don't you? You speak English. Then you can speak with me. Shut up! When the time comes, I will tell you what to do. Sheik Ali, Hans, mirnach. What happened? There was shooting, then there was nothing. Be quiet! Ask him what regiment. Ask him where their outfit is. This ain't getting us nowhere. Bates, bring me up some water. Tell them to take their hands down. - What do you make of that? - Nothing. All right, take him away. Ask him again what his outfit is. Ask him if he's thirsty. Tell him he can have water only if he talks. They're lost, separated from their company. Tell him he's lying. Only if you talk. Keep asking him. We got to break him. Come on, talk! They're an advance party... ...of a battalion cutting southeast across the Egyptian border. Light, motorized units, no tanks, but about 500 men. They've had no water in days. They're told they'll get all the water they want here. Here's your water. Go on, take it. Sergeant Gunn! Just as I expected, the well has gone dry. How much have we got? Nine and a quarter cans. It don't matter, because we're leaving. It'll be a good joke on the Jerries when they get here. Wouldn't have minded seeing their faces. What'd you say? I wouldn't mind seeing their faces when they get here. That's right. Maybe we ought to see their faces. Any water within 100 miles? Not from here, but the first well? - Anything in sight? - Nothing, sarge, not a thing. Hey, Doc, Williams, Stegman! I got a lot to say, and not much time to say it. We found out those Germans are part of a battalion... ...stuck back at the first well, badly in need of water. Think of a battalion so in need of water... ...they got to come 70 miles off their line of march. Suppose they got held up long enough for us to send a message? How? Suppose we send the two Germans to tell them... ...there's water here. Suppose we hold them up for two or three days... ...while they try to get it. There's just one thing wrong with that plan. Here we are. Here are the Germans and here's what happens. You hit it right on the nose. It's 100-to-1 shot. We could clear out of here quick. With some luck, get through German lines and back to ours. If we did get back there, they might even give us a medal. If we stay here... ...maybe nobody will ever know what happened here. Or if it is worthwhile... ...or if it is all wasted. I realize it's not common sense, 9 men fighting off 500. Still, it's the duty of every man in the Army to do everything he can. Excuse me, sir. Nine of us with peashooters doesn't make any sense. If it's our duty to delay this column, why all the talk? Just give us our orders. That brings us down to cases. I look at it this way. Because it's 100-to-1 shot... ...because it's much more than line of duty... ...because there's so little chance of us coming out of it... ...I felt I ought to put up to you. You've all got families at home. Wives, mothers and sweethearts. I ain't got none, so it doesn't matter about me. I know how you feel about them. Whatever you decide, you better decide quick. I'll speak for Waco and Jimmy myself. Nobody minds giving his life, but this is throwing it away. Why? Why did your people go about their business in London... ...when the Germans threw everything at them? Why did your boats take the men off the beach at Dunkirk? Why did the Russians make a stand at Moscow? Why did the Chinese move whole cities thousands of miles inland... ...when the Japs attacked them? Why Bataan? Why Corregidor? Maybe they were all nuts. But there's one thing they did do: They kept delaying the enemy... ...until we got strong enough to hit them hard. I ain't no general... ...but it seems to me that's one way to win. If all I said... ...don't answer your question... ...then somebody tell me why. I'm for staying. - I'll stay. - Me too, sarge. It may surprise you, professor, to know that you're the one man... ...I was absolutely counting on. Mind you, it's against my better judgement. Then I know I'm right. What about you, Frenchie? I still like your cigarettes. All right, on your feet. Stand up. Hey, Doc! Tell him we're sending him back. The other fellow told us the truth. Tell him we're lost too. We need food, they need water. It's a fair exchange. No use fighting about it. Water for food. Shut that man up! He knows English. He tried to warn them. You're playing a game? You can call it that. If he moves again, shoot him. I shall be happy to, sergeant. You know he talked English? I just found out. Why didn't you tell me? I was afraid. I'm like a man who fights his shadow. You give me water, I eat your food. I swear I will do nothing wrong. I give you my parola. That's my word. We got to work fast. I want that tank dug in, and slip trenches. That's William, Stegman and Bates. Take the Italian along to help out. All right, Doc, go ahead. Waco, start them on their way and then bring up the half-track. Go on, beat it! - How is it coming? - She's almost full. - How many you got left? - A little over five canteens. And this is for you on the road. Take it, Waco. Okay, Tambul. Got it filled? Pretty sure of yourself. I like to travel. It broadens the mind. I wish you wasn't so cocky about it. You think I can't make it? I ain't saying. I'll take a bet on it. - Even money? - Why not? I got an even chance of getting there. I'm eating British mess tomorrow. Here's five says you won't. Here's ten says I will. That's a sucker bet. If I lose, I won't need the ten. All right, Waco. Joe will hold the money. Okay, Waco, get going! You got to make it. Tell them we need help if they can send it. Don't worry, I can make it. I can make this thing stand up and howl. So long, fellas. I got to mail a letter. Now right. Turn it more to the right. Now straight ahead. It's a good thing the Jerries had mines in this scout car. They're coming over the hills. That's right. Here are your belts. Cover yourself, Frenchie, and watch that German. Around that corner, back of the wall. - Everything all set here? - All set, Joe. Hold your fire till they get to the top of that ridge! - Hey, Doc! - Right! Jimmy! - Bates! - I'm here! All right, Frenchie? - Tambul! - Fine, sergeant. Stegman! I think I saw something white out there. Sarge, they're showing a white flag! We said we'd make a deal with them. It looks like our trick is working. I'll see what they want. They can do the translating themselves. Watch yourself. You can't tell with these blighters. Don't trust them, Joe. It's a trick. I'll be all right. You just stay there and keep me covered. Major Hans Von Falken. Gunn, United States Army. You have come a long way to pull British chestnuts out of the fire. We don't mind. We like chestnuts. Don't want them to burn. Very good. You didn't come to crack jokes. What do you want? Can you negotiate? Where's your captain? It's around 5:00. You know how those Britishers are about their tea. I understand you propose to give us water in exchange for food. We thought you only had about 30 men. You knew there was a battalion. The soldier who gave the information confessed. He's been executed. Isn't it still possible to come to an agreement? What's the deal? Surrender, and you'll be free to go... ...with as much water and food as you can carry. We like it here. We're pretty well fixed. Plenty of water and a lot more food than we thought we had. I'll make you an offer. Water for guns. For every rifle, I'll give you a pint. For the mortar, a quart. For all your rifles, I'll give you water enough for all your men. I've heard you Americans have a great sense of... ...humor. I'll give you a last chance. You can save your life, and the lives of your men. You heard my offer. Water for guns. How'd you make out? - He spoke English pretty good. - What'd he say? They think we got so much water we're swimming in it. They're worse off than we thought they were. They'll let us go if we give them water. Do you think Waco's reached a British outpost yet? - It's possible. - Maybe they're on the way. I can see them crowding around, clapping him on the back... ...giving him glasses of ice cold water. They're getting anxious. Just got two of them. Good, but take it easy, will you? If we keep on, we'll be on our last belt by tomorrow. Isn't it enough to get two? Got to get 10 with every shot before I'm satisfied. Here's your water. Time to strike the rock. What's that about a rock? The other day, I was making fun of you. I said you'll perform a miracle. Strike a rock and water will run out or maybe champagne. The only miracle I know is the one you get by working for it. I wish a miracle would cure my corn. Why? Gives you something to think about. I've got plenty to think about. I've just been working on a problem. What kind of a problem? You might call it a project. A project? I'm planning on how to irrigate this desert. What, all of it? Why not? Turn it into a blooming garden. Ain't a bad idea. There's plenty of water, only it's not in the right places. It just stands about, waiting for people to drown in it. You feeling all right? As I remember, you can irrigate one acre... ...with about 15,000 cubic feet of water. You're nuts. - Where'd you learn all that? - I'm a typesetter by profession. You learn by reading while you're setting type? Nothing like it for an education. I've set type for about 5000 books. Prose and poetry. You wouldn't believe it, but I'm very partial to poetry. A book of verses underneath a bough, a jug of wine and... It was 100-to-1 shot, Williams. Now is the time! We must reach the German camp to tell them there is no water here. No, I cannot do this. We have only to overpower one man. Maybe we can take the machine gun and kill them all! I do not want to. I got no hate for these men. It is not for you to decide. I'm not going. This place will soon be taken. If you refuse to help me now, I will denounce you as a traitor. Denounce me then. Italians are not like Germans. Only the body wears the uniform, not the soul. Mussolini is not so clever, like Hitler. He dresses Italians up only to look like thieves, cheats, murderers. He cannot, like Hitler, make them feel like that. He cannot, like Hitler, scrape from their conscience... ...the knowledge of right and wrong... ...or plant in their heads his own Ten Commandments. "Steal from thy neighbor. Cheat and kill thy neighbor." You dare to insult the F?hrer? That would take an artist. I am but a mechanic. But are my eyes blind... ...that I must fall to my knees to worship a maniac... ...who has made of my country a concentration camp? Who has made of my people, slaves? Must I kiss the hand that beats me, lick the boot that kicks me? No! I'd rather spend my whole life living in this dirty hole... ...than escape to fight again for things I do not believe... ...against people I do not hate. And for your Hitler... ...it's because of a man like him that God... ...my God, created hell. German escaped. Tell them, no water. I lost him. I'll get him, sergeant. There he comes. He hasn't got a chance. Dirty! He got the Heinie. Bates, this is for you. How are you, Leroux? How are you feeling? Fit as a fiddle. The sergeant say this is to last through next week. Sergeant likes his little joke. In all the world, there's nothing-- Free French Corporal Leroux, parlementaire. Major Von Falken. I was the only one he could send. The others are bathing. Be careful, it's all we've got. I'd give plenty to see the expression on that Heinie's puss. Very impressive. And the rest? All dead? We'll make no further attempt to take the well, if we get water. This is my last offer. Report it to your commander. You are very generous. But my sergeant did not say we'd like to hear your terms. He said maybe you would like to hear his terms once again. For every rifle you send, he will send a pint of water. One rifle, one pint. Two rifles, two pints. Three rifles-- Enough of this nonsense! If you don't like these terms and you still want the water... ...then you must come and get it. Fire! Frenchie was right. We don't know the Nazis. They did shoot him in the back. Come on in, Doc. Sorry I can't give you a tall one. - How's Jimmy doing? - Running low on ammunition. - If we run out, what'll we fight with? - Bayonets, gun butts, fists. How long can four of us keep on that way? I don't know, Doc. I have to admit, it sounds impossible... ...but we got to do it. Somebody will have to work a miracle. A miracle? What kind of a miracle? You got me there, Doc. Four of us holding off several hundred of them... ...is nothing short of a miracle. You know why we're able to do it? Because we're stronger than they are. What do you mean? I don't mean in numbers. I mean something else. Those men out there have never known... ...the dignity of freedom. Dignity? That's a funny way to put it. Maybe you got something there. We've all got something. Joe, I'm hit! - Can you make it inside, Jim? - I'll try. You've got to. Come on. Up! Get down! You'll be all right. It's going to take a lot more than this to kill me. That's the spirit. Never say die. Water! Got to make it. Somebody's lying there. Is he dead? He's an American. That was a close one. They got the well. Bull's-eye in the well. What's the difference? No difference. As the saying goes, "It was fun while it lasted." I wonder what it feels like. - What? - Cold steel. They tell me it's over pretty quick. I never did tell you what my first name was. No, what is it? Osmond. Right, it's a funny name. That's okay. Hope somebody finds this. Finds what? - My tag. - Why? If they don't find it, I'm missing. If they do find it, I'm dead. If I'm missing, nobody will know I'm dead. If I'm dead, nobody will know I'm missing. I might as well be dead. Here they come. It looks like they're all coming this time. Okay, Osmond, this is it. Why don't they finish it? Come on and take us! We're waiting for you. Come on and get it over with! Come on, we ain't surrendering! Water. You're giving guns for water. Go ahead, there it is! Drink all you can find. Go on, take it! There it is! Roll in it, swim in it! Drink till it rolls out of your ears. Go ahead! Drink till it splits your guts. It's full of water. The shells opened up the well. It's a blooming miracle. That's just what it is. Get down there and take their guns away. Let them drink, then line them up. I'll cover you from here. It's an American tank. With some German prisoners. Send some men to pick them up. It's them! They're coming to meet us. She made it! Hi, sarge. It's good to see you. How's Lulubelle? Hello, boys! Tell us about it. We had a crummy old time of it. - Hi, Waco. - Hi, Joe. You got a butt? Crummy-looking bunch you got here. How'd you get them? They just walked in. I see you whittled them down a bit. They whittled us down too. Jimmy? How was it? Pretty rough? Pretty rough. I've been out of this war for a few days. What's going on? The limeys held the Jerries at El Alamein. Too bad they didn't know about it. They'd want to know. Halliday. Doyle. Tambul. Williams. Stegman. Frenchie. Clarkson. We stopped them at El Alamein.
