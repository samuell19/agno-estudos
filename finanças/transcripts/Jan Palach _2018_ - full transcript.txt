VŠETATY DECEMBER 1952 Ouch. Asta, wait! Come on! Jan...! -Jan, where are you? -Where are you? -Jan! -Jan! -Jan! -Asta, where is Jan? -Jan! -Jan! Jan! KAZAKHSTAN JULY 1967 Volodya, come here, you Komsomol member! -Shall we smoke one? -Yeah, we will. What a moron! Communism depends on people like this. -What kind of an invention is it? -Grandpa fought in the Second World War. It is a memory of him. Jan, don't overdo it. Nobody's watching. Somebody always watches you in socialism. Look, look over there! Hi, girls. We work like horses here. We can’t go swimming. We must eat this shit. Would you like to go swimming? Andrea, Zaya, Anna, how about it? -Are those leftovers from yesterday? -No, it’s for dinner tonight. We’re going to eat this shit forever. -Let’s not eat it! -We’re not eating this! The Czechs refuse to eat. What is it? A strike? No. So, what’s going on here? You know what’s going on. Well, so you are striking. As you wish. What about you? You are not from Czechoslovakia! You are Komsomol members! Eat! Are you a Komsomol member? Are you a Komsomol member? Yes. I am a Komsomol member. Get up! Get to your tent. I know about everything. One thing is clear-- you behave like children and demand the same rights as adults. I decided you can go swimming in the lake. I know about everything. You can only swim so far from shore where the shortest of you can still stand. And nobody will look down on the food you get here for free. Nobody! You! I know about everything. Go to the dining tent, we'll talk. Do you want to wash off that dark spot on your reputation? Think about yourselves! He'll be punished. They'll probably expel him from school and from Komsomol. Fall out! Excuse me, Comrade Director. It does not make any sense. Wow, look at this big Czechoslovakian proletarian. Please allow me. Either there are rules or there are no rules. If you expel a Russian and allow a Czech to stay, there are no rules. It does not make sense. Yes. It is logical. I will not expel anybody. You have the word of a Communist. And now you can show us you can work as well as talk. Thank you. Is that how you dance our national socialist dances? What a guy! Are you not happy with us? It is better here with girls. A gift for you. Grandpa made more of them. I’ll never forget you stood up for me. Thanks. Did he give it to you? You don’t smoke anyhow. Russian men launched a satellite With Laika the dog in it, they forgot to feed it PRAGUE, SEPTEMBER 1967 And then they screwed it That’s my bed. We played it in Czech and they did not understand a word. They dance to it like it was real rock 'n' roll. Russian men... We traveled through half of Russia with this song. With Laika the dog in it, they forgot to feed it And then they screwed it Jan, you have a female visitor. Hands below your belly! Turn, lock your knees and wiggle! This is not fun, this is therapy! Breathe in the water! Enough! And now swim alone! Concentrate on your muscles. Get all muscles involved. What we can do in the water, we’ll soon be able to accomplish on the ground. Without any help. Slow swimming. -Thanks. -Could we please get another coffee? -How about a lollipop? This is a beer pub. -Leave it here. Thanks a lot. Are you talking for everyone? That’s how wars begin. Red Right newspaper says: "Former Nazi colonel Peter von Butler will be named on April 1st, 1968, a Deputy Chief of Staff in NATO Central Command in Belgium." Those Belgians, they can take a lot. Germans twice took their land, twice they burned down Leuven, and now they have a Nazi general in charge. -Belgians! -It is horrible. My father said that in Vietnam you do not have a choice. Either you burn to death or Americans will do it with napalm. -Here you go, young man. -Thank you. -What else can I get you? -World peace. You won’t find it here. Look, amusement! No amusement. They won't fight. You can sense it. Did she stand you up? Did she have a date? She did not. Eva keeps her word. -Sorry I'm late. I got stuck in a parade. -What parade? The power went out at the Strahov dorms. Students protested. They’re all mad. What do they want to do? They're looking for someone to complain to. -To who? -What do I know? To the president? They’re in good spirits, all fired up. Shall we go look? Yes, I can manage. Stop! Did you hear me? Stop! Stop running! -He’s on the right! -Stop, you son of a bitch! Stop! Stop! Do you want power? Here, you got it! -Halt! -We are halting. -Do you want to hit a girl on crutches? -Who are you? -We’re students. -What do you want here? -You may guess. -Do not provoke us! We can get them at the dorm. They have no place to escape from there. They had no mercy. They beat defenseless people. They kicked us. -Used tear gas. -Shame on you! Followed us from Neruda Street to the Strahov dorms. They claimed it was a plot against them. But we could not turn on the lights! -It was they who turned off the power. -That’s him. The professor. Do you want to say something, Professor? Well, I came here just to listen to you. But I must say, four years ago, your living conditions were discussed among the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. What solutions did the comrades suggest? It’s going to be solved. I just want to make sure nobody will be punished for raising your voice. -That’s him! -It’s me. -Helena! -I always feel better when I see you. -This is Jan Palach. -Oh, Colleague Palach. -I hate to bother you. -No bother at all. -What is your major? -I would like to be a historian. All that happened here today would be impossible at the School of Economics. That’s not fair. But hotheads like you usually think that way. So, history. Well, let's see what I will be able to do for you. Goodbye! Thank you. Goodbye. That's a lot of people, a lot of people here. Friends, please make way for Comrade Minister. -We're going to the Head Office. -I'm here incognito today. I have an appointment with the comrades in the School Head Office. The chancellor is on your side. So please stay calm, will you? Do not let anybody misuse you for political reasons. Things are moving your way even if it does not seem like it. I realize young people must raise their voices if something does not work. Young people must raise their voices if something doesn’t work. That is clear. My generation wasn't better off. And we paid for it in a big way. Believe me, I know what an insane cop can do. I was in a lockup. So I understand why you want to be heard. I am just begging you-- let's not make our streets a battleground. Believe me. We're trying to solve it. It will come out OK. You have my word on it! My word. Let’s go on. My word. Now please let me through. I'll get things moving! -Kids! Please make way! -Thank you. Thank you. What am I supposed to do? -Hi! -Hi! -Hi! -Oh, you brought Jan here? I better get dressed. So, what happened? Smrkovsky. He is a tough guy. I am glad I could introduce you. He’s a old, lecherous tomcat. "I always feel better when I see you." But he’s smart. Smart, old, lecherous tomcat. The sequence is important. Jan, I really felt hurt when you told the cops I am disabled. It really hurt me. You were hiding behind me. I am not disabled. I’m going to make some tea. They’re tight. -Ouch. -Can I join you? -Yes. Look what I got today. What is it? It’s blood. -Yuck! -What do you mean, yuck? It’s my blood. I got it for my third blood donation. Really? So it is not fashion jewelry from Jablonec? Helena, I did not hide behind you. Ouch! What about Helena's surgery? Is she walking yet? She had polio, not the flu. It's improving. -She’ll be walking within a year. -I’m glad it’s better. Would you believe we will remember Masaryk and Bata again? That's nothing. Did you read the article about the trials in the '50s? Everybody betrayed everybody with a mouthful of great truth. You just can’t understand it. How does it feel to touch your kindergarten mate? Don’t get pissed off. -To life! -And to the canceling of censorship! -Volodya! -Jan! -Sorry, I took the wrong streetcar line. -No problem. This is Lada. No, he is a predator! -Hi, predator! -Hello, Volodya! I’m leaving. Have a good one. Sit down. -Volodya, they let you come over here. -Yes, they did. -Beer? -Yes. -Beer and vodka. Two of each. -No, no, I won't drink. What do you mean, no? Two beers and two vodkas. Volodya... What a beauty! I drink to the meeting of two people from different parts of the world -who like each other. -Yes, it’s wonderful. You’re a hero. You saved me. The commander was a swell guy back then. You made him out to be a swell guy. He came to the dining tent and told me: "Volodya, you have something in you which makes other good people take a risk for you. -That’s why you can’t be a rogue." -Yes, you cannot. That’s exactly what he told me. Yes. The chairman! He’s a big shot there. Big shot! You exaggerate, Volodya. I love you. I liked you from the very beginning, and we didn't even know each other before we joined your group. We knew each other! We just did not know it. I love you. -No! I love you! -No, I love you! -I love you! -I love you! You can’t ever love me as much as I love you. This is what you get if you volunteer to donate one and a half liters of blood. And now I’m going to give it to you. My blood. Blood. We're best friends now! I often visit young people. You know it and you ask questions. Brave questions which were not possible to ask half a year ago. We have a new president, a hero of the Russian Patriotic War. Sasha Dubcek is leading the Party. What happens down here reflects our leadership. If you think that the Soviet Union is running this republic, you are, my friends, dead wrong! When cherries were ripening Sweet cherries were ripening And a warm wind was blowing Towards remote hills... -Boys, which one of you is Masopust? -Me! Me! -OK, I am Jezek! ...under the burning sun I drove my herd When cherries were ripening Sweet cherries were ripening Sweet cherries were ripening And how did it go on? -Here you go. -Thank you! Food or letter first? Letter. Here it is. I have been admitted! I have been admitted! I have been admitted! -I hope you won’t give up like me. -I won’t! -I hope you'll make a good living from it. -I'll take one, please. Philosophy won’t make me rich, but I will understand everything. You can bet on that. -Mom, this letter was opened. -Yeah. -So, you open my letters? -Yes. Official ones only. Did you know it? And you, brother? -Mom, would you open my letters again? -Yes, official ones. But they‘re mine! Congratulations and enjoy your meal. Enjoy! Jan, where are you? Censorship lift confirmed by a law! Farewell to Zdenek Stepanek! Two thousand words belonging to blue collars, white collars, just everybody! Americans bombing Vietnam! Police commando stormed Academy of Arts in Paris! Censorship lift confirmed by a law! Does our socialism need two Marxist parties? Spirit of time, Holy Spirit. It comes for you, comrades. I'm examining second term slackers today. Otherwise I would be at the beach already. -I just wanted to thank you. -What did I do that was so brilliant? I lost my hopes for transfer. Why are you standing here like this? You look like Jirasek’s character. Sit down. Can’t choose one? You cannot sit on two chairs. Wow, you’ve chosen the left. If I understand it correctly, you were not admitted to the School of Philosophy because your father was an entrepreneur. -He was a baker and candymaker. -That is a disturbing class origin. I also should not hide my mother is a Party member. Do you take it as an honor or an offense? Mom is rather... practical. Maybe if she were not, we would not be sitting here together. Will you take my class? I’m not sure if I can take sophomore classes. One of the conditions is German -and my German is... -Not perfect? -I do not speak German. -Oh, yes, the war is long over. You know what? Read Comenius first. -I’ve read Comenius. -In Latin? I’ll add Latin to German. Very good. Helena said it is not proper. Mom said it is. It's handmade from the war. I got it from an architecture student. It is yours. I don’t smoke. It’s nice of you. Thank you. Travel a lot, my colleague. You'll find out the world is full of colors. And there are oceans as well as ponds. Those returning home through a grove in the evening Should keep their eyes down And not look at the tangled willow Otherwise they will find out even though it seems impossible That a small star grows on a branch amid its leaves Once in the meadows we saw a small boy crying on that willow Who believed he could pick the star Dear listeners! Stay tuned. Wake up everyone! -We will broadcast very important news. -Jan, it’s war. -Jan, it’s war. -What? The Soviets are here. Prague is full of tanks. It's on the radio over and over. -Are we defending ourselves? -They didn’t say. ...and not to resist the occupying forces. So our army, police and People’s Militias were not ordered to defend our country. The Central Committee of the Communist Party considers this act not only a breach of relations among socialist countries, but also a breach of international laws. -Yesterday on August 21st... -I must go to Prague. -No. -Yes, I will go to Prague. This is not fun. Your life is in danger. -I have life and thus I will go to Prague! -I’m telling you, you won’t! -It is my decision, I’m grown up. -No! One of us must be reasonable! I will go to Prague! Mom! Damn! OK, I won’t go, I promise. But don’t lock me up like a dog here! Comrade Smrkovsky, who’s the only one talking to the press, stated this is happening behind our back and against our will. The building he is at is surrounded by Soviet troops and tanks. They are aiming their weapons directly at the windows. -We are waiting for breaking news. -Lassie, stay! In a moment when you hear our national anthem, it will probably be the end of our broadcast. Message for Michael Protivniak, Vydran, Medzilaborce County. We are all right, Jarka. Message for Volak family. Soldiers obey all orders, parents say hi. Message for Ms. Vanickova in Luhacovice. Children in Prague and Usti are well. Please call! Who are you? You must be a spy. Do you realize where you are? This is Charles University! University, do you understand? You are aiming at the president! He is a hero of the Soviet Union! A hero of the Soviet Union and the Great Patriotic War! Get out of here! Our mic is outside the radio building window so you can know what's happening. If they tell me to shoot, I will. We don’t want to hurt anyone. We have our orders! You would do the same if you were me! Break away! -Halt! -Stop! Where do you think you're going?! I am going to visit my president. Get lost! Well? We are convinced you will act the same way... -Go home, you activist! -Go! Run, I’m telling you! ...and try to do what’s necessary at your workplace. We believe Czechoslovakia will remain socialist and democratic. Sovereign and independent. We will best support our leaders by staying calm and prudent. Let us believe in socialism and democracy. You hear a firefight. Dear friends, please stay calm despite the shooting and everyone's high emotions. Go! What are you waiting for?! Do you hear me? Go! Show us who you really are! We will fire! Get lost! Go home! Restricted area! "They're trying to suggest that your enemy is the soldiers of the allied forces. They're convincing you that Russian occupiers came to destroy democracy and all results of January 1968. They're suggesting that Moscow is against your own way of development and that's why tanks are in Prague. Citizens of Prague, your enemies say it! They waited all these years to misguide you from the path to socialism. Today your enemy attacks your greatest achievement: socialism." Who’s against socialism? MARCH 1939 = AUGUST 1968 Russians can’t win this. They managed to anger even those who were not angry yet. Please ban all athletes from occupying countries from the Olympic Games. -What’s wrong? -Give me a kiss! I can’t go on, my arms hurt. The trams aren't running. Wait, get on my back. Don’t worry, get on my back! We’ll get home sooner! Did you rescue only our people or Russians, too? Our people, mostly young, about your age. They were shot in their heads, bellies... -How many victims did you rescue? -Anywhere between 30 and 40. Each ambulance had three or four wounded in it. -Was it like the German occupation? -No, it was worse. The Germans were enemies. The Russians were supposed to be our brothers. I cried like an old hooker, really. Jan! Jan! We’re here! Hi, Mom. How come you closed up already? Well, I did. Helena, come here and sit down. -I just do not want to feed them. -Why are there so many Russians here? They have some secret device on the truck over there. It's a radio jammer with a radius of many kilometers. Come in! Jan... What about your broken promise? -Hi, Mom! -Please help Marta, will you? Help yourself! Can I have some water, please? -We don’t have any! -How do you water plants? -Rainwater. -For sure, you old bitch. Supposedly, they have typhoid fever from using water from the pond. -Mr. Rada, why are kids so close to them? -Boys are interested in weapons. Hey, guys, don't do it. They are mean! They are occupiers. Come help me here, it leaks. Do you want to try it? Do you want to shoot? Wanna be a soldier? Thank you. Get the onions! Jan... What's up? Come here. Lassie, we’re home. She’s going to have puppies any moment. She’s a little runaway bitch. There is nothing I could have done to prevent it. I am at work all day, nobody else is at home. -Will you have coffee? -I will. -Thank you. Maybe she does not run away. Maybe somebody visits her. If you fixed our fence, we would not have this problem. I will give away five puppies to friends at the station and we will drown the rest. Lassie, you are a stray cat. Who knows where in Tabor my brother found you. Lassie is from Tabor? My brother and some chick brought her on a motorcycle. She left, Lassie stayed. -Yes! -Good day, everybody! Look who’s here! How’s Prague? -I brought you the oven. -Take your shoes off! -It works now. Cable was broken. -Cable, yeah? I want to show you something. When using it, do not put it too close to the wall. A postal worker from the Nigerian town Kabi decided to baptize his son as Dubcek. Girls who used to admire pop stars are now waiting in front of the Central Committee building every day. There are more of them and they are more passionate. And they’re not alone. I don't understand this worship of morons. They didn't shoot them in Moscow, so we won? Bullshit. They didn't shoot them. They knew it wouldn't change anything. I haven't trusted them since 1950. I do not believe a word they say. -Will you have coffee? -I'll have coffee. -Do you want yours strong? -Yeah. How many sugars? Three spoons? Are you going to sleep where your mother tells you? No, I won’t! I say no! You got your food. You’ll sleep outside. Come join me. -Hi! -Hi! For you. I got it from my brother. He wanted to give it to his son, but he had a daughter. It’s yours now. Lassie, you little floozy. FRANCE OCTOBER 1968 -Is it the last one? -Yes, one of the last ones. -I am here. -Jan, how do you say river in Czech? -Reka. -What? -Reka. -Do you understand Polish? -Yes, I do. It sounds like Slovak. -What is your major? -Economy, but I study in Paris. -What about you? Will you go back? -Go back? Will you defect? There are a lot of Czechs in Paris who are thinking about defecting. Yeah, if we all defect, then Russians would have a place to live. They’ll be surprised! Jan, we're full. Wait for the next truck! Sorry, I only speak English. Too bad. English is for the English. In France, we speak French. -No! -Stop! Thank you! Good job today. We're done! We'll drink to that! Thank you. -No alcohol, please. -It’s not alcohol, it’s wine! -Cheers! -Cheers! Honza or Jan, it’s the same. -Have a drink! -OK. -So, you’re Honza Jean Palach. -Yes. Honza Jean Palach. Mélanie! Give me that wine! Thanks. This is what Jan calls reka. To the Rhine! -To the Danube! -Get rid of Russians soon! -And de Gaulle! -Are you out of wine, too? -There’s some more on the truck. Get up! Let’s go to our truck hideaway. I keep thinking about what you said. Do you have a better life here? I don’t know. Are you aware that a guy burned himself in Poland to protest what’s happening there? -What? -Police beat up students in Warsaw. The government sided with Russians and sent tanks to your country. Hold on, don’t you know about it? Do your people know about it? There was nothing in the news. And we have free press. No report in Poland as well. But everyone knows. 10,000 people witnessed it. -Who was the guy? A soldier? -No, just a common guy. He burned himself in a stadium during the summer festivities. We went back through Paris, Marseille, Monte Carlo, Venice and Vienna. -Did you enjoy Paris? -Yes, I did. Did you see it all? Even Pigalle? Yes, I did. How's work? Don't you miss school? Kablo factory in Kladno. I’m getting familiar with it. They play premium ice hockey. Angry people like anywhere else, single women like in Prague. Did you hear what happened in Poland? -In Poland? What happened there? -Tea’s for you, isn’t it? Thank you. Protests against the Russian occupation. I don't know anything about it. Romanians are real dudes. Everybody talks about them in France and here as well. France again next year? If Party and God permit, yes. I will go no matter what Party and God think about it. Go get lilac and poppy blossoms! The Olympic Games in Mexico are going on. We set our hopes on the gymnasts. They were beaten by the Japanese, but their results are not bad at all. Hi, Jan! -That's good! Where did you get it? -It's folk art. -Ciao, dudes. -Hi! They shot hundreds of students and still started the Olympic Games. Nobody says anything. They’re happy they can participate. It’s sport, not politics. They expect you to forget what’s important. ...gymnasts led by Vera Caslavska, who’s our big medal hope, and the whole world is awaiting her results. And now we will play our Olympic team's favorite song, which belongs to our politicians as well. Our nation’s future depends on their vigilance and strength. This is what Lennon said: don’t believe anyone over 30. He mocked someone. I'm bringing you good news. No one should be alone anymore. Joseph Smrkovsky! He’s probably one of our hopes that things will get back to normal. Mr. Smrkovsky, hold on tight. Support us. We hold the flag up! The road's a bitch, she's cruel like a lady scorned and heartless In a girth of foil, tiny shields she holds A luster sparks her eyes when she heaves into the darkness Two fragile sprigs of crimson gladiolas A luster sparks her eyes when she heaves into the darkness Two fragile sprigs of crimson gladiolas Sergeant, the white sand is gleaming like the arms of Daniela This sense of dreaming a point of aphelion That long forgotten silence we wished to listen to Sergeant begotten and now we’ll all be christened Morituri te salutant, Morituri te salutant You medical students learn Latin. What does Morituri te salutant mean? Those who are about to die salute you. Above this earth in a span of pigeon wings The cannon played a march which buries peace imploring And stirs a down that slaughters as it sings The cannon played a march which buries peace imploring And stirs a down that slaughters as it sings The road is dust and tar and soil dry and soldered And silver bullets a werewolf once bestowed The aging dirt, my gun rusting on my shoulders WE’LL STAY DEVOTED -Mom! -Maybe I am a little bit curious. From Russia? What a device! Your friend has a sense of humor. What are we going to listen to on it? Their station from Dresden? -Or Voice of America. -Yeah, Voice of America. The comrades scramble it. The same as during the German occupation. They give us receivers and we will listen to their nonsense. That’s why your Russian sent it to you. Wait! It’s fine. Don’t be paranoid. He mailed it because he knows how difficult it is to get information. He sent Brezhnev’s radio. Jan, you are very naive. Mom, people are not responsible for their leaders. They are not Russians, they’re Russian people. Russian people. On October 5th, the Defense Secretary Martin Dzur announced that within two weeks most of the allied forces will leave Czechoslovakia. -On October 21st... -Pass the pan. ...Hungarian, Polish and Bulgarian troops started to leave our territory. Soviet troops will remain in Czechoslovakia, and it seems like it will be like that for a long time. Nations must defend themselves using their intellect. This is their role. Socialism in Czechoslovakia will live on. I am convinced it will come out of these hard moments strong. From now on, we have to get used to a legal temporary stay of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia. I have been a Communist my entire life, not since just yesterday. A disciplined Communist. To get things back to normal, we must get relations with the Soviet Union back to normal. It is no secret. The whole world knows who is the leading force of the Socialist Alliance. Soviet Union, isn’t it so? On October 16th, a treaty was signed between the governments of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union about the conditions of the Soviet troops' temporary stay in our country. In fact, from now on, we cannot call Soviet troops an occupying force. Could you please inform our listeners in what part of the country will the troops be stationed? It feels good to be able to use both of my legs. -Really good. -Be careful. -Are we going to march in a parade? -I’ll be happy to make it to the dorm. -This is more important. -There’s not too many people here. Look, don’t do it. Don’t do it, otherwise you will have problems. I want to have problems. OK, you will have them. Eva! you said you would stay at the dorm, not that you would be here. Jan, I don't think I will go any further. The police is ahead of us. The police? I'm gonna look at what's ahead. Excuse me, I’m sorry. Excuse me. I apologize. Hi, guys. It looks like not only students are marching with us. You asked for problems, here they are! Get off him, he’s not moving! I’m checking your ribs for fractures. -Do you have a stomachache? -No. Are you dizzy? Does your head spin? Do you have nausea? No. Close your eyes, spread out your arms. Touch your nose with your finger. It looks good. If you need me, you know where to find me. -Colleague Palach! Still in good spirits? -Always. -Keep the flag flying. -Yes, we will. OCCUPATION STRIKE Keep up the good work. We're happy we can help, but it must stay among us. Action program. Cabinet politics prohibition, legal security, censorship for six more months only, free travel for everyone, who is it for? Where will you write about the strike if you do not have a publisher? Let us be realistic and ask for the impossible. -Do you know where Holecek is? -He’s right behind you. Lubos, this is a journalist from Reporter magazine. -It has not been published, or has it? -Well, he's here after all. -Here you go. -Thanks. -You look tired. -It takes too long. Let me read you something. "Every nation is accepted by the world in the way it behaves." -Who wrote this? -Masaryk. -Are you reading? -No, I’ll go to sleep. -Good night. -Good night. -What are you reading? Masaryk? -Yes. I do not want to go to sleep yet. Can I read with you? What will be our press release? The course of the occupational strike was satisfactory. Except for the public ignoring us. The trade unions did not even reply. -Smrkovsky was making fun of us. -In our opinion, it was satisfactory. Classes stopped at all schools. Even at the School of Theology. The secretary of education was with us while Dubcek and others kept silent. -Reporter magazine will be printed again. -Culture Life in Bratislava won’t. We will tell the press that the strike is over. I do not like the expression "is over." Put down "suspended" or something similar. -Let them be scared for a while yet. -It is over. You just called it. Why did we strike? We wanted the population to join us. Who joined us? -They all dumped us. -Remember what we wrote here. For the first time in 20 years, we students are acting as a power you must deal with. This action should prove our determination and ability to participate in social life. And how are we wrapping it up? Retreating from our positions. Merry Christmas! We did not fight anyone. We just wanted to unite people, but they don’t care about it. We are alone in this. We could be glad we did not get beaten up again. It looks like getting beat up stopped being a problem. Let’s clean up the building. We will finish this for now. STRIKE Lubos, is this not the right time to do something just because no one is doing anything? -To do what? -Take action. U.S. intelligence agencies call it "tension escalation." Do something nobody could predict. Occupy radio. Put pressure on one of the Moscow collaborators. Jan, slow down. Do not talk like this in front of anyone. Did you not get enough bruises a month ago? I can assure you that even among us in the strike committee, we have people -that talk to the police. Be careful. -Student informers? Yes, students. I do not know who they are, but they are among us. I have no illusions about it, but I am not suicidal. It will get tougher. They might start to build camps. They have plenty of experience with it. Russians will like it. Proceed with care. Students are naive everywhere in the world. Professor! -Professor! -Here I am. Good day, sir! They told me I could find you here. Colleague Palach. It’s all absolute chaos, Professor. I need your advice. Advice? About what? Do you still read the newspaper? -Of course. -The old comrades guard has been heard. Listen. "We are determined to bring the situation back to normal. Soon there will be a time when the Party will ask each one of us: Comrade, what did you do in the year '68?" There is always a group of people beside you who sees their benefits differently. Just because we did not hear from them lately does not mean they disappeared. So it's all a fiction. A total decline of everything that made sense. Smrkovsky. His support was so strong. He gave up. There’s going to be more of us like this. -What are you going to do? -Same as everybody else. Wait. Thank you, Professor. Did I disappoint you that much, Jan? Excuse me. We had a bit of fun. All goes back to normal as of tomorrow. -Decent children of polite parents. -They could call the police on you. Or they could just use gas. You've said enough. Do some cleanup now. You can’t go through here. Use the hall exit. I will lock this door. -You can lock up. We’ll use the back door. -OK, you won’t be able to come back. Yes, you won’t. It will be locked. No more shuffle here. The strike is over. This is a nightmare. Why did we even write this? Wait, Jan, wait... I can't eat any more. -Here we go. -Thank you. -Here we go. -Thanks. Jan, do you read the Zpravy newspaper? You’re probably the only one in this republic. "Greetings from the Central Committee of the Soviet Union Communist Party. Unity is the goal of all Communist parties." "The destiny of our country is in your hands." "Published by the Red Army." Right! They pretend to be a Czech newspaper, -but you won’t see one Czech name there. -Nobody takes them seriously. They should. They write what we can expect, and it’s one lie after another. The government does not protest. They just let them publish it. Merry Christmas, Jan. Congratulations on being completely healed, Helena. You're neither her first nor her last one. I belong to nobody. I’m not anybody’s first or last. I belong to nobody. Can you understand that? -Hello, philosopher! -Hi, guys! -Give us some business. Buy our carp. -I’ll take two. Go ahead, take your pick. Give me a medium size. I’ll go get some oranges. -What’s new at your school? -Same as at yours. -So, you keep the flag flying, don’t you? -Yeah. Miss, please don’t touch the oranges. Wait for your turn. Excuse me. -Say hi to your mom. -You, too. -Say hi to your brother. -You, too. -Happy holidays. -Same to you. -Do you want an orange? -Do you want a carp? Will I hear from you? -Hi, Mom. -Hi. -We’re here. -Who’s we? -Me and my carps. Let me see. Nice ones. Take this and I will close up. You were striking like hungry workers before the Second World War. Students on strike because big shots fight for their posts? Let working people go on strike. You students should study. Mom, those who work won’t go on strike. People are fed up with politics. We’ll be alone at Christmas, Mom. Jirka called. He’s not coming. Yeah, I spoke to him. You know, his baby is five months old and coughing. Jan, you’re the only one who’s still home with me. -Mom, did you read my mail? -What did you say? You opened my mail. If I understand this right, this package came back. Maybe your Russian friend is not interested in books. I sent him Capek. Why doesn't he like it? I do like him. He was here with us. Jan, maybe it has not even been delivered to him. They did the same to your father. Mom, be logical. If they did not deliver it, they would just destroy it. -He’s scared. He wants to be an architect. -Logic, Jan? There is no logic. One can only wonder what's possible here. Yeah, wonder. You nod to anything. You joined a party that confiscated my father’s business. And it killed him. You're proof that they own you. They're right. Jan, I do not belong to anybody. I am yours. They let me have my train station kiosk and did not move us as they usually did. You and your brother can study and you can do what you want. I am glad about that. What are you trying to tell me? Logic. Prague City Hall is horrified. You have no idea who applied there. They always have plenty of applications, but this one was from St. Wenceslaus. With great sorrow, I must tell you I cannot take it anymore at Wenceslaus Square. It is a very displeasing job to be on duty at Wenceslaus Square. Even my horse is getting silly. How could Mr. Hasler predict all that? We are the people of Prague... You jealous girl, you! We won't give up Prague We would rather tear it down We'd rather tear it down, we'll tear it down right now We are the people of Prague with blood from the Moldau Hi, Hubert, this is Jan Palach. Will you be in Prague over the holidays? I must speak to you or I am going to go insane. You're the only one I can say it to, but not over the phone. OK, New Year’s Eve at the dorm. No worries, I’m all right. Don’t forget, in January we’ll go to see a theater play. Vinohrady Theater. OK, thank you. Have a good one, bye. God became a man, born out of a woman, like every one of us without exception. He lived like us and passed away in a horrifying death. However, his death was not the end. To the contrary, a new life has transpired. And we may enter it. It is a peculiar situation. We may love our life, and at the same time, we do not have to worry about death. Thanks to Christ, we have hope that our extinction will not cause our relationship with God to end. We all need to hear these words. We sampled the beauty of free life, but for a short period of time only. The beauty of freedom fades away. We anticipate what will follow. It will be odd and gray. How well we know how to live less than a full life. With a pungent feeling of uselessness, we realize what could blossom into beauty if enough light and hope could remain. The birth of Christ annunciates that hope remains and will continue. Our internal freedom does remain. No one can take it away from us. The words of the Holy Writ stand no matter if we live or die. We belong to Christ. Amen. Comrades, don't believe anybody over 60. -How old is Brezhnev? -He’s over 60. OK, Comrades, don’t believe anybody over 70. You can't fit Svoboda in there. He's 73. So don't believe anyone over 80. You know what? Believe nobody or everybody. -Excuse me, guys. Did you see Jan Palach? -No. -Do you know anything about him? -I saw him before Christmas. -Isn’t he coming? We should meet here. -No, he did not mention that. Comrades, American students want you to know that if you won’t fuck the system, it will fuck you. Let peace be with our land wherever we go Anger, hate and fight, fears and crime may we never show Never, never show To New Year’s Eve! Go home, Ivan! Girls don’t love you here! Go home, Ivan! PRAGUE JANUARY 1969 Hi, is Simona here? Are you Jan? I am supposed to tell you she’s waiting for you in Holesovice where you met once. Thank you. Aren’t you going to be in trouble for that? Could someone find out? Be careful with it. -Are you going back to the dorm? -I am going to Všetaty. My uncle died. I am very sorry. ETHER How is Prague? It’s all right so far. How about here? We’re waiting for news from Prague. Or from Moscow, it looks like, maybe. We can't stay any longer. She could catch a cold. You don’t have to be here. The little one is more important. Jan, we forgot to buy you a hat. You cannot attend a funeral without a hat. Don’t even try this! I’ll come to Prague and buy you a hat. If you want to be an adult, you must behave like one. So my mom is a grandma now. She really looked forward to it. She’s going to be around children again. She loves it. Jan! Do not make any noises. Your aunt is still sleeping. Close the window, it’s getting cold here. Leave it alone, I’ll clean up later. I will come tomorrow to buy the hat for you. Mom, do you want to know why I love you so much? The world is breaking down and you worry about my hat. Your bare head at the funeral looked like we do not have money for even a hat. And please be quiet! PLEASE FORGIVE ME. JAN -Hi, Jan! -Good day, Ms. Krobova. -Is your aunt feeling better yet? -She’s devastated and staying with us. They brought several bundles of it. It’s free and nobody wants it. They can babble about whatever they want. I'll throw it away later. I’ll keep one if I may, please. -Bye. -Bye, Jan! -Good morning! -Hi! -Why did you take down the cartoon joke? -The dorm inspector took it down Tuesday. -Post this one instead! -Do you still read the Zpravy newspaper? "Lenin’s portrait flies to Venus." "Successful fight for socialism guaranteed." Thank you, it’s not for me. However, these boys are getting better and better. -Helena was looking for you. Contact her. -OK, thanks. Jan, class will start shortly. Do you know that? -If I don’t show up, please excuse me. -You can count on it. "These words might look funny, but they are true. Since our nations are in a state of desperation and resignation, we decided to express our protest and wake up the nation as follows. Our group consists of volunteers who are ready to burn themselves to death. I was honored to pick number one. I have the right to write the first letter and to be the first torch. Our demands are: immediate cancellation of censorship, prohibition of publishing the Zpravy newspaper. As you can see, our demands are not exaggerated, they’re the other way around. If our demands are not met within five days and if our nation will not support them by a nationwide strike, other torches will burn. Please realize that among those torches could be your loved ones. My colleagues, our actions put trumps in your hands. I myself hope you will use them wisely and effectively. P.S. Please excuse my handwriting. I hope you understand the state of mind I am in. It is worth mentioning that... It is worth mentioning that a son of a CKD worker is one of the torches. Torch number one. I believe there will not be a need for more light." Again. Please don’t clean it up. Let him learn how to do it. If not, he will consider a woman to be his maid for the rest of his life. Crow, crow... "Mr. Hubert Bystrican, Kablo Kladno, national enterprise. Hi, Hubert. Greetings from the city at Moldau. Your Jan Hus." -Maruska, how long a hose do you need? -Fifty meters. -Good day. -Good day. Ms. Hoffman, I told him we don’t have it, but we do. It does not matter. He’ll buy it elsewhere. How many do you have? Maybe 20 pieces. That's good. We'll sell it. -Is that all? -Yes, thank you. Eighteen times two, 36. Look at this. Put it under the counter so we won’t forget it. -Is it closed? -He’ll be right back. It happens here all the time. It’s a shitty gas pump. Are you waiting for me? I am here alone. I had to go to the bank. OK, here we go. -Is it for your motorcycle? -Yes. -How much does it take? -Excuse me? Nothing. We'll give it a try. Two liters. Be careful. Next time, get your bike here. It's eight crowns, 80 hellers. Hey! Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Don’t touch your face! Don’t touch it! Don’t touch it! Put your hands down! Lie down! Lie down.
