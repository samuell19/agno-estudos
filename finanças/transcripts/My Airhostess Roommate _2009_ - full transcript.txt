Wait, let me give you a hand How come you like keeping fish so much? You've got so many of them here! I'm here alone so often, they keep me company Wow, unbelievable! You can't just come in here whenever anymore Before you come in, knock on the door first Come in! I came up here to talk to you about some rules for living together Oh. Wait one second Here Could you help me take it downstairs? Thanks Let me first tell you my rules Rule One: Each person will store his or her own belongings No party shall use the other's belongings without having first received permission from that party Rule 2: All public spaces must be kept clean No smoking allowed while I'm at home Rule 3: While at home, the parties must wear clothing that covers 60% or more of their skin Rule 4: Unless you've asked me for permission, please don't bring any strangers into the apartment Rule 5: Without having previously obtained the other party's permission Please do not enter that party's room Rule 6: When going to the bathroom, remember to lock the door because I always forget to knock Wait! How many more of these rules are there? At the moment, I can only think of 23 Oh, you can say your rules I'm fair 23 rules? Even the military only has 21 rules! You need two more? You're invading hallowed ground! Don't worry! I'm not here to invade you I'm here to save you Right now I'm just feeling one thing What are you feeling? Like someone's taken over my nest Wrong. It's... cohabitation So have you had any sort of emotional trauma that turned you into such a love skeptic? Ugh, don't talk about that with me Who does really understand love, anyway? But you should understand love! You're making a cartoon about love, aren't you? Okay, I'm going to give you a lesson Love is like the wine in this cup Rich, fragrant, alluring Then let me give you a lesson Do you have a rubber band? Grab it, and don't let go What are you doing? Grab it... don't let go... Don't... What was that for? That's what love is Love's just like stretching a rubber band In the end, the one who gets hurt is always the one who's not willing to let go But you know, Lu Fei you really are completely harmless Don't move How terrifying In one stroke you've managed to break three different rules First, you went to the bathroom and didn't close the door Second, your clothing isn't covering over 60% of your skin And third, that's my cup Sorry, I forgot you were here It's all right But you need to make up for such horrible behavior today These are the three rules you violated All right, all finished Does this have anything to do with me? Of course it has to do with you From now on, each time you break a rule, I'll take that rule off the glass door Once they're all taken down, I'll leave here Then I need to study those rules If I break every one I can get you to move out of here quicker As you like Yes Municipal criminal investigation squad.

What I mean is... flatmates It'll be best for you to keep your distance from her Don't go looking for trouble for yourself Ran Jing can't have broken the law What are you getting at? I can't disclose anything “The story of woman criminal Ran Jing after being released from prison” “Origin Chinese Network's Ran Jing” “Kebao & Boloni Chief Designer Ran Jing” “Policewoman Ran Jing” Hello, please show me your identity card I'm a teacher at Yubao Middle School in Yuxiang Village My name is Ran Jing The thing I hate most is when people call me Superwoman My goodness, what are you wearing that for? Are you trying to surprise people, sitting in the dark like that? I like to stay in the dark and think Okay then, carry on I won't disturb you Did you tear these rules? Do you really hope that I'll move out soon? When a man and a woman live together, it always causes problems Okay, I understand Lu Fei, you've turned into a terracotta warrior! Get back to the Qin Dynasty! Say goodbye to the rules I didn't ask you to move out tonight It's dangerous for a girl to be going out so late Put it back! Put it back! Don't touch my things Get away! Let go! Let go! I said let go! If you don't let go I'll call the police! You'll call the police? When they come here looking for you, you really dare to call them? The police came to look for me? The policeman you're talking about, was it this guy? Yeah! Is he a friend of yours? A classmate Then why'd he come looking for you? I've never met anyone as dumb as you Oh! He likes you! No wonder people say you're a moron when it comes to love Who? Don't change the subject! Sorry Your apology is insufficiently sincere Then what are you going to do about it? You still want to add a Rule 24? Times two Help me move my things back upstairs Don't step on the rules Pig! Candidness is the foundation of sincere interaction The basic data about each party. Shall not be concealed from the other party The airplane is currently passing through an area of turbulence Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts Please do not leave your seats until the seatbelt light has been You broke the rules Your clothes aren't covering over 60% of your skin I thought you were probably a flight attendant I've found you out You're going too far, Lu Feil Don't you ever pull this type of stunt again, not ever! Ran Jing I know you're in there Ran Jing, I'm certain you're right there You're standing there watching me, aren't you Hello? Get up! Hurry! What are you doing? There's some guy outside covered in muscles! Covered in muscles? Just like the policeman who came by that day I never get involved in other people's emotional lives When the elephants fight, it's the grass that suffers You know that! I'll be an elephant, then. You can be the grass You and I are like two locusts tied to a rope If I don't get any peace, then you can't either Ran Jing, open the door I know you're there I even brought water I'm still not leaving, open the door or not If you don't open the door I'll just turn into a statue and stand right here forever.

I didn't realize you were such an irresponsible person I believe my fiery passion will melt your heart of ice! Bye-bye Don't... Don't you dare laugh Are the guys who like you all this crazy? Go on and talk I asked you to meet the attack You just stuck your head inside your shell like a turtle! What are you going to do now?

We're on the same flight Really? Great! He really is very handsome Don't talk to me about the air Don't tell me that you don't get along well with such a harmless shut-in? Why not? I said not to talk to me about that bit of atmosphere How come I can't get through here? What, are you playing a game? I accidentally deleted a friend's account, so I'd like to train a character to the same level for him Hey, come over here I'll show you what a real expert at these games looks like Jing, what's this? “Daily videos of living with a flight attendant” Is this me?

Ran Jing You know her? How wouldn't I know her? She didn't just appear out of thin air So this was always the plan? As soon as I finish the work, she was going to leave? She's leaving? For where? Why didn't I know about this? So you arranged for her to move in? Don't get so emotional Let me tell you the truth She's the sister of an old classmate of mine She told me that you once rescued her She's always thought very highly of you You two ganged up to mess around with me! No, not at all Absolutely not that Is she really going to leave? And so everything's reached that fatal crossroads You still want to run away and desert, so useless Go away, okay? Don't spout that crap at me If you avoid me you're just avoiding a third of yourself Doubt is the bane of love Maybe she's testing you right now Then should I take her test? You're such a moron You don't have a clue about anything You're trying to court her In love, you have to follow the rules Then what should I do? You wait, I'll talk to her for you I know you'd hate to lose Ran Jing Little Jing, do you really want to leave to go study? Would you hate to lose me? I know I can't stop you But I'd really hate to lose you I'd hate to lose you too But my mother's last wish... Can you promise you'll come back to me? A promise would mean it's not certain Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly Pig, let's have an argument Have an argument? We've never had a good argument Before you leave you really want to have an argument? Good times are easy to forget It's easier to remember bad things I want you to remember me I won't ever let you understand what it feels like to be hurt So while I'm gone Can you keep the room open for me? Don't worry I'll even keep make sure your scent will still stay in the room But scents... will fade Cut it out You look like some wanna-be macho man You're planning to just let her go like that?! Love should be selfish! So I should make her give up a chance to study abroad, just for me? Being apart for so long would turn the strongest passion weak and puny! It wouldn't be any different from just splitting up with her! “If our love is strong how could we ever truly be apart?” I don't believe that crap! Love is about being together every day! Day after day, tied to each other, just like these! Always together! Together! Together! It's a rule! Understand? I tell ya! Lu Fei! Lu Fei, what are you doing?! Stop shaking me! If you keep shaking I'm going to fall off! Yeah! I'm going to make you fall off and get paralyzed so I can take care of you for your whole life! What's possessed you? I don't need you to care for me! Stop shaking me! I want you so stick by me every day! We'll never leave each other! You really don't want me to leave the country this much? Yes! Because I love you! I'm hopelessly in love with you! Don't try to escape me in this lifetime! Lu Fei, you can't be so selfish! I won't let you leave! How could I have ever liked you? Are you sure you really can't leave her? Forcing her to stay might influence the whole course of her future Could you deal with that? Are you sure that your love will be able to stay fresh after two years? Then I think you already know the answer Don't you?
