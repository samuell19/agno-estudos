Who swapped my leather goods for the opium? Who set me up, tell me I... I don't know But it's you who gave me the leather goods for delivery I am now wanted by the authorities Tell me who set me up I don't dare to Aren't you afraid of death? Don't kill me... Then tell me It's Lan Fei, the Black Leopard I am innocent... You shouldn't kill me... Don't move... Teng Piao... They say Teng Piao, the Iron Chain, is a tough nut How true it is! The only person I want to see is Lan Fei who caused me to be imprisoned for 15 years not you But he sent me here to kill you he'll also give you the chance of survival Go to Master Zhou Bai at the Flying Eagle Town get $5,000 Then go away and never come back again This iron chain has locked me in prison for 15 years I'm bringing it specially with me to strangle Lan Fei You are looking for death Master Zhou of the Flying Eagle Town Master Zhou, the gold is on the way Our men will keep an eye on it There are also 4 cargoes of goods worth $3,000 It's been paid Master Zhou, the goods from Nan Ning County have arrived at Lung Men Town They will be here in about four to five days Besides, we've hired four security guards who are also expected to arrive today Master Zhou, in response to your instructions Master Chen has a reply Okay The report is finished What happened to the hundred packets of cigarettes that were lost in the Jia Hsin County? Master Zhou, the goods were lost in an inn at the Nan Ning County I believe that they were stolen by the Qing gang at the Nan Ning County Shut up We Qings from the Nan Ning County have always been under the protection of Master Zhou We won't do anything ungrateful But many people will do anything for $4,000 Xiao Tong - Yes Give Old Tien a knife Yes Master Zhou, don't accuse me wrongly I asked Xiao Tong to give you a knife but I didn't ask him to kill you Take this knife and kill the four brothers of Mao Master Zhou, what happened? Peng Fu Yes How much are 100 packets of inferior grade cigarettes? $400 How about medium grade? $1,500 Superior grade? $4,000 When we delivered this shipment did we tell them what kind of goods they were? No If it weren't them who had stolen it how would they know that they're worth $4,000? Let's go Master... Big problem What happened? Someone outside with a corpse wants to see you What's his name? Teng Piao What? Teng Piao is here? This is my gift to Lan Fei, the Black Leopard Ask him to come out I've heard that Teng Piao has been creating troubles at the outskirts & is on the lookout for Black Leopard At last you are here in Flying Eagle Town Because I know that this is the only place where I can find Black Leopard But you might die here Did he tell you that there's $5,000 waiting for you to pick up? Too bad I am not in need of money Listen well I am here for Lan Fei, the Black Leopard You don't have to fight for him Your kung fu is really good No wonder you can come all the way from outside the border with only this iron chain You are wrong It isn't because of this iron chain that I am here It's because of my persistence for revenge in the last 15 years Stop Master Zhou, please help me with two things First, tell the Black Leopard that I'll be waiting here for him till he comes Second, please tell me which is the best inn in town The best one is Jin Ling Inn "Jin Ling Inn" Customer Sir, please Have you just arrived? My name is Teng I've heard that this is the biggest inn in town A lot of important people passing by stay here Sir, you are too kind, you need a room? Is there any? Of course, please This way please Sir, please Hurry and bring some tea Sir, is this room okay? Not bad Who's the lady staying at the penthouse? A weird kind of lady, we'd say! She's been here for almost a month Makes it a point to take a peek at every new customer but never talks to anyone She hasn't got any friends Anything else, Sir? Nothing for the time being Then I'll go back to my work Please Iron Chain... it's been 15 years Master How come it's you? I'm bringing you tea Get out It's not so easy to ambush you How did you get in? Climbed in from the window when you were talking to the waiter Why the need to do that? Didn't want to be seen You are Teng Piao? How do you know? Because you have the iron chain Who are you? My name is Shang Lin, I've been waiting for you here You know me? No Then why were you waiting for me? I'll tell you, I definitely will but not now, and it wouldn't be here Back to you Hurry and report to Captain Ji Hurry... Go and tell the Black Leopard that he's the one I want and don't send anymore men here to die Go... Here... Captain Ji, it's him You are Teng Piao? Did you kill all these men? Purely in selfdefense I understand No matter what please come along to the station now Smoke? No I've heard that you've just arrived and already killed a guy in the valley outside the town It's because he too was after my life I realize that and also your reason for being here Oh yeah? This is a small town, you see News spreads pretty quickly especially when it concerns Master Zhou Bai Oh, why so? Because Master Zhou Bai's power extends within 90 miles of the Flying Eagle Town So everyone would know if anything happens to him I am not here for him though I know that too But if I were you I wouldn't be looking for Lan Fei in THIS place Think about it carefully A lot of things happened since you arrived If it goes on like this, things will get even worse Then our security team won't be able to help Master Teng, where are you going? I am not going anywhere I'd rather stay here to wait for them Besides, I've been awaiting them for 15 years Master Teng... I appreciate your kind intention Master Teng Is Teng Piao's kung fu really that great? As an old saying goes: Everything has a purpose to it Master, there's a letter from the province What about it? What's that? The boss from the province heard news that the central government has sent an official to deal with us What's his name? It doesn't say No? Could it be Teng Piao? Send them out Get out... Close the windows Master Zhou, would you want Hei Ji's men or the Five Tigers from Huang Shan summoned? No I want all my six brothers back Your six killers? You are here! How did you know I'd be here? Because you would thank me for saving you yesterday I didn't tell you yesterday because I was afraid of being heard What you say is a secret, huh? Like you, I am also after Black Leopard For some kind of revenge? No, I just want to ask him one thing I want to ask him where my husband is Fifteen years ago my husband said he's going to look for Black Leopard and then afterwards, he never came back Fifteen years! All that time I've been looking for Black Leopard but nowhere could he be found And hence you waited for me here knowing that he will come to kill me That's the only way I can find him If you come across him please do inform me Have you seen Black Leopard before? No In the martial world there's just 7 guys who know him Apart from him the other six are his blood brothers And altogether they are known as the Seven Killers Not only is each of them deft at martial arts but also as elusive as the devil Then how do you know that they are here? I spent a lot of money and killed a lot of people before I could get this information Flying Eagle Town is known to be their homeland And so you let a word out that Teng Piao is coming to this town for Black Leopard for the sake of making them show up But how can you tell who the Black Leopard is? It's easy. The reason why he's so named is because he's got a birthmark like the head of a black leopard on his chest Whoever has this birthmark is the Black Leopard But how can you tell when he is clothed You don't even know whether it is a man or a woman Could be Boss Jin of this inn It could also be Master Zhou Bai It could also be you It could be anybody in town "Jin Ling Inn" My luggage comprises valuables, be careful Yes Friend, are you her luggage too? No I just happened to be traveling along with her She's sure got a lot of luggage Boss... is Boss here? Coming, what can I do for you? I am Gui Lan Fang Miss Gui I heard of a chap causing trouble at the outskirts & carrying an iron chain is putting up here His name is Teng, do you know him? I'm just asking Are your rooms clean? Of course Find me the best one, money is not a problem Alright... please Please Please Miss Gui, how about this room? Alright Where's Teng staying? In the opposite room Put my luggage well Yes Okay Put the luggage well Sure... Hello, can anyone talk here? Yes, I can Are you Teng Piao? What's so funny? People talk about you as someone extraordinary but I think you are no different from an ordinary man Why did you come all the way to see me? Because I am a woman who especially likes men Besides, I'm quite well-to-do Unfortunately, you'd find me of a different nature I have no money, and I don't like women especially women like you Really? I don't believe that I'm just staying opposite to your room If you want me, you can come over any time especially during the night Waiter, come here Who's the boss? Come here Who's the boss? Coming... what may I bring you? A few dishes for a start then a bottle of wine And a person too A person? That's correct, I'm here to look for a person Has someone by the name of Du come here lately? What do you want me for? Nothing, it's been said that you are worthy that's why we brothers would like to get something from you You've a quick report of news I've just arrived and then you show up Hurry and go... Du, you just wait and see, go... Master... are you alright? Fine Do you need me to call security? No... it's just a petty quarrel And as for the damages... please put them on my bill Alright... Everyone, it's okay now... Please go back... everything's fine It's so weird How come there's been so many people in town recently? There's a reason for everyone who comes here Trading, making money, escaping or killing people. But... it doesn't seem you're here for any of these purposes Really? Let me warn you in advance however If you are not involved in any of these dealings you'd better not poke your nose in the matter What you said earlier is indeed true Black Leopard can be anyone in town these days There are two today but there could be more coming in the following days From now onwards, you have to be careful Miss, would you need hot water for your bath? No... I'm fine Miss, don't stand too close to the window It's high up here, you'd get killed if you fall down The govt. will just brush off your death as an accident But it ain't worth dying like this, I'd say! I haven't met you before, who are you? I'm a new employee; first day on the job here My name is Madam Mei So weird How come there are so many strangers here today? Miss, the water's ready Pour it into the bathtub please I can't undo this buckle Could you help me clip it off Which one? The first one What's taking you so long? Coming Is it the first one? I'm cutting it Wait, how come the window is open? Master Teng, you are back? What's going on? I was just going to take a bath Do you want to scrub my back? I'm sorry, I haven't worked in a bathhouse I don't know how to scrub a woman's back Silly fool The buckle is undone, no need to cut it Now get me the Russian soap from the box please Yes Waiter Is the soap here yet? Coming Miss Gui, and you... You are a man after all You may go Any man would love to see a naked woman Come, scrub my back then help me dry it After that, you can do whatever you like The woman just now... Miss Gui, what's this all about? Who am I supposed to ask? Me Who are you? Have you heard of the fifth of the Seven Killers The Coldfaced plum blossom? That's me No wonder it's been rumored that a lot of people who dealt with you would die mysteriously Oh, so that's the reason! Who sent this woman? I don't know, she's just a servant here Servant here? Wait until all people outside are gone Who are you? Why are you saving me? Never mind that; Just go tell Black Leopard I am Du, and I need something from him Also that, Teng Piao isn't someone he can mess with Master Teng, what happened? Just now a woman wanted to kill me Where's she from? What? It's Mei who started working today Oh, her? Who's she? Recommended by the boss of Lucky Gambling House "Lucky Gambling House" Opening up...

Nobody's I just don't want to see you imprisoned now Don't move Master Teng, I've told you before not to create trouble here Otherwise you'll die here some day What about it? Du's kung fu is a match for Teng Piao? That's right And his flying dagger is much better than Xiao Tang Say, if you were Du Guo Cheng I couldn't intercept even one Is he really that good? Peng Fu Yes Where's Du from? Du Guo Cheng is a bachelor He traveled north from the city and traveled west to here, changing rides enroute He didn't say a word during the journey Nothing else is known about him Is he from somewhere around the province? Ask one of our chaps to check Du Guo Cheng's background Hello Deputy Ma; is Chief there please? Yes, he is Boss Lan, what can I do for you? Are you having a cargo of silk, leather goods or silver delivered from outside the border that you want me to send troops as an escort? Don't make fun of me I am not Everyone knows that you are the one with the most shops in town Please Please sit... Boss Lan, what can I do for you? You're too kind I would like to ask you to check on someone Who? I've a friend in Flying Eagle town who wants to get in touch and do business with Du Guo Cheng Du Guo Cheng? Never heard of him Sort of a handsome guy with modern haircut He wears a suit, and dresses fashionably Chief, could he be that person? That person? Who do you mean? I'm referring to that murderer who killed 2 government officials and robbed the money Flying dagger, dynamite Why is there so much money? It's mine I won that money Miss Shang, you've seen clearly I've gone through the luggage alright but I haven't seen you clearly You have good skill and possess a lot of funds Yet, why come to such a place? Isn't that strange? Yes, it's very strange Strange things do happen Take you as an example Being a defenseless woman and not knowing kung fu you can stay here safely and pry into other people's belongings Because I thought you were the one I was looking for Then who were you looking for? It isn't you Alright, you've looked over everything I've also asked what I wanted to ask Now please go, so I may carry on with my affairs Sorry to disturb you Bye Friend, you can come out now Have you been hiding here for long? Yes, indeed We haven't met, have we? Not yet What are you doing here? Someone wants to meet with you, so I... Please Song Yue said your flying dagger far excels mine It's better to put your dagger closer to hands What a deadly flying dagger! You live up to your fame What is it that you seek? Nothing I've heard that you can deal with Teng Piao so I'd like to ask you for a favor What is it? Kill Teng Piao First of all, I am not a professional killer Secondly, even if I kill Teng Piao for you I doubt very much you can pay the price My offer is an amnesty warrant from the government Your charge in killing the two government officials will be dropped You've checked on me? Your real name is Zhang Yue Lin, a wanted criminal It's said that Master Zhou of the Flying Eagle Town is very resourceful; I can understand why To tell you the truth, the purpose of my coming here is to ask you to help me find a way Kill Teng Piao for me Are you sure you'll get the amnesty for me? Of course Sir, your dishes Thank you Master Teng, who are you waiting for? No one Du didn't show up in the last few days That's right I heard you and that Du fellow stirred up things quite a bit at the gambling house No big deal Master Teng, forgive me for saying this You've made it very clear that that you are here for Lan Fei, the Black Leopard You're in the wrong place Every corner of the Flying Eagle Town is under the influence of Master Zhou and Master Zhou and the Black Leopard... I know. That's precisely why I'm here Have you seen Black Leopard before? No Then how could you tell who the Black Leopard is? For the sake of killing me, he will show up No wonder there are so many people around these days First, there's this Miss Gui then the sneaky Miss Shang There's also that fellow named Du He's the strangest of all He's good at kung fu and an expert in flying dagger What's his purpose of coming here? It's been said that Black Leopard is mysterious He always dons a disguise; could it be... I'm not sure either But no matter who he is I will find out very soon Help... Did you see two men taking a girl away by force? No You cheated! Stop beating... Looks like you are not carrying a coffin but waiting here for me Hurry and go Master Teng, you are here It's you again, where's Miss Gui? We only pretended to capture her to lure you here We've already taken her back to the inn Knowing her temper she should be giving our men a hard time by now Why have you asked me here? Open it There are two boxes of silver inside It's the same old story hoping that Master Teng can forget about the past It's also the same old story for me If you don't handover Lan Fei I won't leave this place You'd rather die here? Who's going to kill me? They? How come you are here? Haven't I told you before Wherever you are, I'll be there You asked me before who I was but I didn't tell you anything Now I can tell you I am a runaway I'm a runaway who has killed government officials You will definitely want to know why I am here Because I'd like Master Zhou to think of a way for me Master Zhou is willing to get me an amnesty warrant But... But you have to kill me first That's correct I have found the right person after all Bring Teng Piao over Don't come close, where's my amnesty? You want it now? That's correct. Right now I have seen a lot of rascals in the martial arts world but not anyone as slimy as you though Both your hands are wounded Stop playing a hero and try to keep your life Where's the amnesty? Alright, you hand me Teng Piao first and I'll give you the amnesty tomorrow Cook the hound when the hares have been rundown These are the rules of the game, I only know too well No amnesty, no Teng Piao Master Zhou, I'll give you one day's time If there's no amnesty Day after tomorrow I'll free Teng Piao It's okay... don't go... Is that Du fellow still inside? He's still here I've heard that, that Teng fellow still has a fever Let's go How did you know Teng Piao's wounds are infected and that he has a fever? That's because he wants me to get him a doctor everyday That's why... Waiter... You go Waiter... Sir, what can I do for you? Get me some hot water Yes, sir How is it going inside? I don't know It seems Teng Piao's wounds are really infected Right, that means if we make a move we have only one person to deal with But we have over twenty people here Attack Dynamite There's dynamite at the window Had I thrown my flying dagger lower you would have been blown to smithereens There's dynamite at every window here Just 'cuz you've more men don't think you can barge in I think you'd better tell Master Zhou to bring my amnesty or I'll take Teng Piao away from here tomorrow No, please don't Master Zhou has already gone to the official court I think it'll be soon when your amnesty is brought here I think we'd better go back first wait till Master Zhou comes Sorry to disturb you... Let's go That Du fellow would hand Teng Piao over to Black Leopard Does that mean Teng Piao is going to die? Unless we can get him out before Master Zhou comes Du will not let us in I've got an idea Captain Ji Du has taken Teng Piao hostage at the Jin Ling Inn Please go and get him out I heard that he's got dynamite and flying dagger How can I get in? Listen to her, she's got an idea Mr. Du, open the door, I am Shang Lin Miss Shang, why are you here? Didn't you say you need a doctor? The doctor is here now Doctor? He's the best doctor in here, he's a friend Open the door Get inside Hurry Everyone, please don't create any trouble tonight Why? Because Master Zhou may be here tonight Would Master Zhou really come? Then we'll wait for him outside Go Please... Doctor Don't move Captain Ji Miss Shang, what's going on? They said they are here to rescue Teng Piao What? Don't move, back off Stop arguing. Hurry and get Teng Piao out I can't Let me do it, watch him Don't move, you too Captain Ji, you're trapped Don't move, back off; come in No.7, you're smart No. 7? That's right, I'm No.7 of the Seven Killers He's my third brother No. 3? They are... The Seven Killers You should have known Had I not been one of them how could I operate such a big inn in this place Captain Ji, Teng Piao must be too heavy for you but please help us carry him outside Move Please Where's Master Zhou? He's coming Du Guo Cheng, you didn't appreciate my kindness You deserve all this But even if we have to die here it's worth it Because it's said that no one in the martial arts world could see all the Seven Killers together That's correct The seven of us are all here today If it weren't because of you fools we wouldn't be here together Big Brother, we are able to catch Teng Piao today we should have thanked Miss Shang for it In fact, it ought to be me thanking her and not you How come? Are all the Seven Killers really here today? Yeah. What of it? If you are to be arrested, today is the day Who dares arrest us? Me And who might YOU be? My real identity is as the official who's been sent here to arrest you Don't move... No one moves He's my deputy and my men disguised as rascals in order to lure you out When is our troop coming? Probably tomorrow morning Captain Ji, get the security troops here to bring them back Yes Take away her gun first Don't move or I'll kill him, drop the weapon Get some rope and tie them all up Right You must be curious to know who exactly I am I can tell you now We are the real Seven Killers No.1, No.2, she's No.7, No.3 No.5 & 6 and I am the real No.4 Indeed, very few in the martial world have seen the Seven Killers gathered together Mainly because, all those who saw are all dead Don't move What? You pretended to be wounded! Since we are on the same side why do we have to kill each other? That day outside the mausoleum the officer knew that you were watching us Listen well, I am the central government official Like you, I too am here to get the Black Leopard but he never showed up The only way to make him show up is to have you pretend to be wounded Why should I believe you? You must I've been waiting to show up when you are totally unprepared Then why did you help us stop Teng Piao at the gambling house? Just for the sake of covering up my real identity to gain your trust Black Leopard, I've found you at last You are a real match for me No wonder you could survive in prison the last 15 years Of course My only desire has been to kill you You think you can do that? I've got a gun in my hand, why not? Let's go Look Deputy Ma, escort Miss Shang to the security team and ask the government troops to come immediately Yes, go... Official... We couldn't find a single gun that was thrown out Official, there's one here Hurry Be careful, they've still got a gun Your troops won't be here until dawn By that time you would have been dead for a few hours Teng Piao the Iron Chain, your name precedes you It's really not that easy to kill you Master Zhou, I am here for the Black Leopard If you are not the Black Leopard why do you fight against me? Don't move, go Tell the troops outside the town to come immediately Yes Let's go Dead Drop the gun Little did I expect the government official to die by the gun of the Seven Killers! Officer, the troops are at the city's gate We came on ahead Officer... Search the place... I'll go to the Jin Ling Inn first Drop your stick You'd have never dreamt to die under a piece of broken glass! Wait, the troops are coming You want to kill, huh? Not that easy Drop the glass Lan Fei is dead Not yet Where's he? Here Let go Let's go You... Zhou Bai, you... Don't move It's the Black Leopard Black Leopard, why aren't you dead at MY hands! Zhou Bai, what happened? I have long wanted to stay away from them they have abused their powers over the past decade If I don't avail such an opportunity to repent I'm afraid that I'll never be able to get away from them Officer... are you alright? I am fine That's good Miss Shang, we have accomplished what we had to do Unfortunately, we weren't able to avenge your husband Never mind Maybe it's the Black Leopard who had killed my husband Master Zhou The papers from the central government have arrived Not only have you repaid your past crime but also returned all the properties to the government The central government decided not to pursue your case and hopes you'd turn over a new leaf Definitely. Thank you, officer Teng Piao, thanks for your help What are your plans hereon? Don't know for sure either until I get at the outskirts Since you three are going north together I bid you farewell here Hope to see you soon Goodbye That's strange Officer you've been talking to yourself the whole night What's going on? I feel it's been too easy to kill the Black Leopard He sure didn't look like someone who would die so fast Oh, men, come Fire, hurry... The dead body is covered with petroleum Officer, come and have a look What? He's not the Black Leopard Then who's the Black Leopard? Zhou Bai Master Zhou, thanks Don't mention it, do you want to boil it? No The rabbit is almost done Thank you Have some water first Miss Shang you haven't eaten for the whole day Are you still thinking about the hatred of 15 years? I was supposed to be here to take revenge I'm sorry, I killed the Black Leopard You husband might have been killed by the Black Leopard and now he is dead Consider you've had your revenge Probably Come, have some water Drink Wait Officer Du? Wait, don't drink that water Officer, Master Zhou, Officer Black Leopard? That's right, he's the real Black Leopard The one who died was a replacement How do you know? Because that day when the gas lamp broke the petroleum washed the mark off the Black Leopard That's weird. If you were the real Black Leopard you could have killed me; Why didn't you do that? I can now tell you I aspired to have the money all for myself I wanted to get rid of the Seven Killers and it just so happened that you were here I used you to kill them Then how come so many people were trying to kill me? They were arranged by my men I didn't know it at all But I never thought that my secret plan would have been revealed by you You know, God's justice is inescapable I'm willing to give each one of you $10,000 to let me get out of here today I've been looking for you in the last 15 years not that $10,000 Officer Du... it's fortunate you discovered that or else we would be doomed What? He killed my husband? Teng Piao Yes? 15 years ago did you kill someone by the name of Zhou Zhi Pei who was a leather trader? That's correct. It was because he betrayed me Perhaps I haven't told you this before He was my husband You...
