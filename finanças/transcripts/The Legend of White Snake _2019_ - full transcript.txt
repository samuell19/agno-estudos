-Give us back our money! -Give way. Excuse me. -Hey, give way. -My money. Give me back my money. -Qing? -Hey, Bai. You lied to us! -Yes! -Give us back our money! Bai, did you two reconcile? Are they the two of them? -Is she really her sister? -Are they... Are they a married couple? Qing loves to joke around. I apologize for her offensive behavior. Qing, apologize to them. I'm sorry. In order to express our apology, I'll return all the money to you. Not only that, you'll be paid twice the amount. Just treat it as my compensation. Qing, go. That's more like it. Bai. I'm sorry. I didn't get the money. I caused trouble for you instead. Qing. How could I blame you? You did it for me. I am ashamed. It's my fault for causing you trouble. Don't worry, I'll drop by to more herbal stores tomorrow... -I... -It's useless! You don't know... Dear. I know you aspire to help people by being a physician. If this is the case, why don't you set up your own business? You can save more people this way. Dear, it's not as easy as you think. It's costly to set up a clinic in the capital. As of the moment, I'm unable to make ends meet. We can make it if we work together. You've always been clever. Why can't you figure it out? You care about treating others rather than achieving success. You're a capable person. It doesn't matter where you go. Your words are inspiring. Thank you for your advice. You're making fun of me again. He refused to accept my money. It looks like I need other ways to help him raise money to set up a clinic. Dear, you've worked hard. What do you think? The embroidered bird looks almost real. You're so skillful. I'm not asking about this. What I mean was... Do I look pretty? What are you doing? Don't do anything inappropriate. Dear. After meeting you, I've finally realized that you look absolutely fascinating. You're being cheeky. I'm saying nothing but the truth. It's because I'm using a new cream. This Tianxiang Cream can turn a lady into a beauty. You're the smartest woman I've ever met. I'm extremely lucky to have you as my wife. This was made of more than ten types of essences that includes flowers, fruits, and herbs. It smells very nice. Stop it. Buy some patchouli, sun-dried tangerine peel, ginger, and beefsteak plant. Boil it and drink it. Don't catch a cold again. Thank you, Physician Xu. Physician Xu. Do you have Tianxiang Cream? My wife used it once and she looked ten years younger. She has been longing for it. She told me to buy more this time. It has been selling fast lately. It's sold out today. Why don't you come back tomorrow? -All right then. -Don't worry. I'll leave the money here. -Keep some for me, okay? -Thanks. Thank you. -You've worked hard. -Dear. -Do you have many patients today? -There were more people today. The cream you made was sold out this morning. Someone even asked who made the sachet because she's hoping to order dresses from you. -Really? -Yes. That's great. The money we've been saving is almost enough. I'm certain the clinic can be set up by the end of this month. You've only learned how to sew for less than a month from Jiaorong. But your workmanship is already perfect. No matter how incompetent I am, I must not let my wife work so hard to earn money. So I've declined the lady who wants to make the order. Dear. There are calluses on your fingers. You must have suffered. You're the one who's suffering. You worked day and night here while being looked down by others. Look at the both of you. Can your love fill your stomach? My stomach is now rumbling with hunger. My dear Hanwen and Bai, can we eat now? Dear, haven't you eaten anything? Didn't I tell you to eat before sending me food? She would never do that as she cares more about you than herself. Qing. I hope you don't mind the simple dishes I've cooked. Of course, not. I know you've done your best to make it. To me, this isn't just a simple meal. It's special. These two dishes look like the white flowers and the willow that scatter around the city. If that's the case, the other two dishes look like two birds that are chirping in the paddy field. That's clever. You're so talented. -Let's eat. -Come on. What are you? How dare you behave so arrogantly? We are one. You don't fear evil nor lust for beauty. Why won't you look at yourself? Nonsense! Show yourself! I've told you that we're one. Don't tell me you want to kill yourself. I'm not among the living. I'm within your heart. ZEN Master Fahai, Master asked me to pass you this. Fahai, this is Jinshan Temple's secret treasure, Guiyi. It can see through illusion and help you understand the cycle of reincarnation. Take it with you to the mortal world. I hope you can get rid of your obsession and attain enlightenment. NAN MOUNTAIN CEMETERY Father and Mother. I'm already married. Suzhen is pretty and wise. We get along very well. From now on, you don't have to worry about me anymore. Father-in-law and mother-in-law. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Hanwen. TOMB OF LIANG JUN Sir, I'm sorry. The wind is strong. Let's go back early. One day, I'm going to kill Xu Xian for you. Stop. Xu Xian! Why didn't you greet me when you saw me? Greetings, Prime Minister Liang. Were you paying your respect at your parents' grave? Yes, indeed. There's no need for you to do that. Because I'm going to send you down there for a family reunion soon. And... About your new bride. My eldest son really likes her. So she'll be sent down to serve him as well. You better watch out. Sir. Are you all right? I'm fine. I tripped. Son, it's my fault. I was useless. I couldn't stop the corrupted officials from taking our land. I couldn't afford to get you treated. I ended up burying my own child. It's because of the corrupted man like Prime Minister Liang at the royal court that led to these tragedies. If you can't be an official to save people, be a physician and heal them instead. Dear. Let's name our clinic Baohe Clinic. We'll give treatment to both the rich and the poor. Everything will work out in peace. You're absolutely right. BAOHE CLINIC HEAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE Come on, put this over there. Dear. You'll be giving treatment over there in the future. You've arranged everything in good order. Dear, let's check the herb storage section. Qing, continue with your work. It doesn't look bad at all. Sir. How was it? I found out that Xu Xian has set up a clinic in Lin'an. He's preparing to start his business in a few days. I had never been defeated until I came across Xu Huairen's family. My son died without any reason, yet his son is enjoying his life. I have an idea. FREE MEDICAL TREATMENT It's leprosy. She's suffering from leprosy. I heard there's a new clinic here. Can they heal my wife? It's leprosy. It's impossible to cure leprosy. In our village, they'll be burnt to death if they got infected. -Leave! -Leave! Don't bring trouble to us. What happened? It's you. Come in. My husband will treat you. -Come on. -Okay. Seriously? This clinic treats patients with leprosy. We can't seek treatment there anymore. There's no way to cure it. We'll be infected with other illnesses. Let's go. -Let's go. -Let's get out from here. -How's everything? -Don't worry, sir. I found an old couple who have no children and got them infected with leprosy. When the time comes, no physician in Lin'an will treat them. They can only go to Baohe Clinic. Will Xu Xian treat them? He'll definitely treat them. I found out that Xu Xian is bold in using drugs. He suggested using arsenic to treat leprosy when he was working at Jishi Clinic but the shopkeeper stopped him. Excellent. -We'll just sit back and watch. -Okay. Madam. I can cure your illness. But it requires arsenic. Arsenic is aggressive and extremely toxic. Would you want me to treat you? As long as there's hope, I would dare to use any drug. Arsenic, you say? I would even drink it. You don't have to drink it. Madam, here's the medicine. Apply this on the affected area every day. Do it for a month. -Then, the symptoms will be cleared. -Okay. Remember, don't consume it. Be careful. -Thank you, Physician Xu. -Please get up. Thank you, Lady Bai. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Be careful. -Okay. Why do you look worried? Is there anything wrong? Do you remember? They were just fine before this. How did they get infected with leprosy in just a few days? Here. You must be hungry, madam. This steamed bun is freshly cooked. Eat up. Thank you very much. -Why aren't you eating it? -This steamed bun smells good. -I want to keep it for my husband. -Madam. This is for you. Just eat it. Eat it! -Remember, avoid eating spicy food. -Thank you. Let's leave. -What happened? -Baohe Clinic killed a person. -Arrest him! -Yes, sir. Stop! -You can't simply arrest him. -We didn't. Let me ask you. A few days ago, did you give treatment to an old homeless woman? -Yes. -A few days later, the old lady died. That's impossible. Though she had leprosy, it's not fatal. Coroner. Explain to Physician Xu clearly the cause of this old homeless woman's death. Physician Xu. After I examined the body, her eyes, nose, ears, and mouth were bleeding. Her stomach was damaged. There were signs of her being asphyxiated. So I concluded that she died from poisoning. It's the arsenic! Xu Xian said that arsenic can cure leprosy. He must have misused the poison and killed the old woman. Although I've prescribed her arsenic, it's a small amount. I didn't ask her to consume it. -It won't cause death at all. -You admitted to using arsenic. Xu Xian took lives lightly and misused poison to harm someone. -Guys, arrest him now! -Yes, sir! Shut Baohe Clinic down! -Dear. -Dear. -Hey. -Dear. Bai, what happened? Hanwen and I knew this day would come. We didn't expect them to kill someone just to frame Hanwen. They are truly evil. What should we do now? We'll go to the magistrate. -Trial in session. -Trial in session. Xu Xian, do you admit to your crime? I'm innocent. Why should I admit? You tested drugs on a patient to gain popularity and caused the death of a person. This is a death sentence. I've always used drugs appropriately and would never harm anyone. Even if you disagree, you can't deny that she died because of the arsenic you prescribed her. Coroner. How did you conclude the old lady died from poison? From the deceased's complexion and tongue, it's clearly poison consumption. Poison consumption? Now that's odd. The arsenic I prescribed was for external use. It's not meant to be consumed. You said that she died from poison? That's odd. Your Honor, please investigate this matter thoroughly. It's not up to you to decide whether it's consumed or applied externally, Now, you don't even have any proof. Xu Xian. Let me give you a piece of advice. Just admit to your crime, lest you suffer from punishment. The Prime Minister is right. Guys, punish him! Your Honor. During Shaoxing reign, injustice often happen. So to prevent it, Emperor Gaozong ordered that no suspect shall be tortured during the first interrogation. The suspect can't be forced to admit. The Emperor has said that unjust cases occurred when the suspects are tortured. And this is only my first trial. By law, you can't punish me. You have a sharp tongue. Magistrate Lin'an. It seems like you are now a person who will torture the suspect in order to make him confess. How dare you mess around in the court? Officials of state affairs perform their respective duties. As for judicial affairs, Ministry of Punishment and the Court of Judicial Review shall handle all submitted cases. If I'm not mistaken, Prime Minister Liang isn't in charge of these two. Nor is he from these departments. It's against the law if he insists on taking this case. Xu Xian. You'd better tell the truth. Your Honor, my husband is innocent. Your Honor, we have a witness. Dear. You died tragically. Who is this? Your Honor. I'm her husband. I'm here to testify for Physician Xu. He's innocent. How do you know he's not the culprit? It's because she never used the medicine Physician Xu prescribed. So it's impossible that she's poisoned. I suffer from leprosy too. She was blind and I didn't want her to worry. So I hid it from her. I didn't dare to let my wife use it when Physician Xu said the medicine contains arsenic. I applied it to myself secretly. So I was the only one who used the medicine. The medicine has been applied to this area. Take a look. It has healed. Your Honor. Physician Xu prescribed the right dosage for my wife. I was afraid it may not be enough. So I applied a small amount. So I have some left. Whether it's toxic or not, you can give it a try and see it for yourselves. Your Honor. The culprit thought my wife had used Physician Xu's medicine. So he poisoned her to frame Physician Xu. -Someone poisoned her? -That's right. That night, I tested the medicine without informing my wife. So I went out but when I came back, I saw a man assaulting my wife. Stop! Who was that? It was him. Nonsense. Why would I poison her? We don't even know each other. You were the one I saw that night. My wife's mouth was injured. She had blood stains under her nails. You must have forcefully fed her the steamed bun. So she scratched your hand while she was struggling. You cannot deny this! Your Honor, you must seek justice for me. Can this man's hand be examined? Well... Look, there's indeed a wound on his hand. Your Honor. Qin San. You are a member of the Liang household. How dare you poison someone? Outrageous. Your Honor, I was wrong. Qin San took the blame himself. Though we know it's the Prime Minister who's behind all this. But there's nothing we can do about it. But he had suffered too. He lost one of his most loyal followers. It's a pity that these innocent people were dragged into this. The old couple was so affectionate. It must be very hard for him as he's the only one left. From the looks of it, the more affection you put, the more you'll get hurt. In this world, no one can be with each other forever. No matter who leaves first, at least leave love and memories for each other. Life is short and our days are numbered. We should cherish the moment we're together every day. Dear, I'm thankful that we didn't waste too much time. BAOHE CLINIC -Here! -Cheers! Everybody has worked hard during this time. Baohe Clinic's revenue this month has doubled compared to last month. No one must refuse these taels of silvers. Consider it as a present for everyone. -Okay, these are all mine. -What gives you the right? Sit down. I'm your boss. So leave these to me for safekeeping. -Get it from me if you can. -Don't run! -Gosh. -Go. Let's eat. You're here. Sir, take care. Do come again. Sir, give me my usual order, a jar of Qiulubai Wine. Lady Qing, you're here just in time. This is the last jar of Qiulubai Wine. Hey! I saw it first. Lady, this might smell good, but it is very strong. If you want to try something new, why don't you try that peach blossom wine? It's sweet. You won't get drunk easily. Nonsense, it only has a fruity taste. It doesn't taste like wine. It's only for children. I don't care. This is mine. Lady, don't fight with me. This wonderful wine will be wasted if it's landed in the wrong hands. I'm the best when it comes to wine tasting in Lin'an. Who else but I can taste this wonderful wine? That was bold of you. Let me ask you then. In Lin'an City, which store has the best Yuhang wine? It's Lady Zhu's 100 Mile Fragrant at Black Pearl Lane. It's fragrant at the tip of the tongue and have a long aftertaste. You think so, too? Of course, it's so fragrant that you can smell it from far away. Which toso wine do you like the most? Zuikexian at Lion Alley in Qinghefang is the best. Do you know why their toso wine is good? Their ancestors opened a herbal shop and have a secret recipe. That's right. Though herbs are used, it doesn't taste bitter. In fact, it tastes mellow and fragrant. They seal the wine for ten years before it can be consumed. Just a sip alone is overwhelming. Did you drink it before? Of course. I'm Lin'an's wine expert, Zhang Yutang. I deliver stock for Master Qian. He sends me a jar of ten-year-old toso wine every year. -What are you doing? -Buddy, let's make a deal. Why don't you let me get a taste of the ten-year-old toso wine? I'll buy this Qiulubai Wine for you. That's a deal. Let's drink until we're drunk. Drink until we're drunk! Physician Xu. These fine herbs are good. Why are you not satisfied? This is indeed the gentiana scabra, but's it's not the East gentian. This yellowish white core can only be formed in places where there's plenty of rain and mist. If I'm not mistaken, this is gentiana rigescens from Qianzhou. Everybody in Lin'an is using gentiana rigescens . There's no need for you to buy East gentian. Physician Xu, so you want none of the herbs? We'll be leaving. Let's go. Dear, are their herbs not good enough? I suspect that their herbs are not that pure. However, the tiger bone and bile bear are of high quality. The effect of those can be substituted with herbs. I'm trying to use fewer animal products. I wish not to kill animals for medicine. The Buddhist scriptures say that all beings have intellects. It took me a thousand years to realize this. I never knew he's compassionate even though he's a mortal. As expected, I didn't judge him wrongly. They aren't honest, I don't wish to deal with them anymore. But they're the biggest herb dealer in Lin'an. That's easy. Just write a notice that contains all the herbs you want and post it outside the clinic. There are lots of traders in Lin'an. Eventually, they'll come to us. There's no need to rely on those dubious dealers. That's a good idea. I'll write a notice now. -Cheers. -Cheers. Although this store isn't big, but the Qiulubai Wine here is indeed great. You're right. It feels awesome to drink with someone that understands you. This wine didn't go to waste in our hands. Well said, lady. You're educated. Unlike me, I'm uncultured. I... I can't use words to express myself. You're being courteous. You know what? I like people like you. I dislike nerds. -My good friend, cheers to that. -Cheers. By the way, how did you know the owner of Zuikexian? You don't look like a brewer. I often... -What is it? -pick different herbs in the mountain. Sometimes I come across... very rare herbs. And I gave them to Master Qian as supply. What a coincidence. My family owns a clinic. -Have you heard of Baohe Clinic in Lin'an? -Yes. My family owns that. Next time, if you have good wine or herbs, don't forget about me, okay? No problem. You're my partner from now on. No... I mean drinking partner. What do you mean by that? That means we are friends. Yes, we're friends. I want you as my friend. Here, cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers. BAOHE CLINIC NOTICE TO THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO SUPPLY HERBS TO BAOHE CLINIC PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO DROP BY Excuse me, let me through. Baohe Clinic is paying a lot to buy the herbs. They've written down the qualities and price of the herbs, too. I have this one. This will be a good trade. -Baohe Clinic? -Good trade? Isn't this Lady Qing's house? FREE MEDICAL TREATMENT You'll have to wait for treatment. We're still closed. Qing. Zhang Yutang, you are here. Yes, I heard you're looking for herbs. And you kept your promise. I have good stuff and you're the first person I thought of. What is it? Show me. Wait. What's this? It's the bile of a flat-headed snake. This is the only bunch. Take them away. The herbs we need are in the notice. Read it yourself. I'm not educated. Besides, this is rare. So I showed it to you first. I have other herbs here. Just wait for a while. I have snakeskin. This is snake bone. I also have biles of black-striped snake, Mandarin rat snake, and Chinese rat snake. Although they aren't rare, but I have many of them. I can sell as many as you want. Lady Qing, you don't look too well. Your eyes... Your eyes are pretty red. You must have drunk a lot. The heat is trapped in your body. Hold on. Lady Qing, I caught this snake earlier. This is a fresh snake gallbladder which can detoxify and remove body heat. Subtitle translation by Neoh Li May
