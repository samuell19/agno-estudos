-Did you call Paglieri? -What? Paglieri. I'm trying to wake up. Come on. My shaver? I don't know. Maybe I packed it already. -You want me to get it? -No. -You wanted to shave? -Yes, but no. -Yes, I'll get it. - Forget it. What happened? What did you do? I dropped everything. Here… Put these in, then I´ll give you more. I didn't know we had this. What´s that good mood all about? What? -Don't start. -I'm not starting. Are we cool? Sure. -No, no… -What? -No tickling. -I wasn't going to tickle you. Really, it's very early. -No. You see? You play dirty. -No. -Yes. -Easy. -You're mad, crazy. -What… Crazy girl. Easy, easy. -It hurts. -Calm down. You're crazy. Stop it, I mean it. -OK, enough. -That's it. That's it. That's it. No, you play dirty! No… Wait… We have to go. - What? - We can’t be late. -Just a little... -No, really. Later. -Later when? -Later. In the other house. Are you sure? I promise. OK. I can't do this. Calm down. Like any normal day, OK? -Calm down. -Yes. - This? -In that sack. Sign here please. -Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. -Thank you - What? - That way. - No, that way. - The car is that way. -Don´t rub yourself. I'll have a whisky later. Later when? Later today. To celebrate. -You have everything, right? -Yes. I have everything in the blue folder. -You want me to check? -No, it's OK. Yes. I have everything. The money turned you on? What? The money turned you on. OK, how´d we do it? You pull over, drop me off by the door with everything? Or we both go parking… Hello. Yes, Paglieri. Yes, I saw it but we were at the bank. What? What happened? No, sorry, I don't know what to say… Can we still do it today? We're almost there, tell him to wait for us. -No… But we can wait for you. -What's the problem? -Why tomorrow? -No, not tomorrow. Give me… You know, we have everything here. We have everything on us. Motherfucker! We're not singing the deed? Yes… But at what time tomorrow? Don't cancel again. Motherfucker! Let me talk. -Yes, 11. Great, same time. -He said 11, must be 11. Call me back to double-check. No. Double-check now. OK. See you tomorrow, bye. You hear me? Double-check now. Yes, I heard you. But I can't tell him that. It's not Paglieri's fault. The other guy can't make it. -What happened? -I don't know. He got stuck on a picket. He says he can't make it. -What time can he come? -But Paglieri can't. Paglieri is free until two but the other guy won't make it. Fuck! I took the day off, I'll have to take tomorrow too. Same goes for me. You could take a whole week, don't let them push you around. Who's pushing me? Cut the nonsense. What should I do? I don't know. Should we go home? -Sure, where else? -I don't know, to the bank. The bank? And go through all this again tomorrow? I don't know! I’m thinking of you. You get all paranoid carrying the money around. Exactly. I don't want to go through all this again. Paglieri is an asshole. Yes, he is. And we are assholes too for not double-checking. What are you doing? Double-checking what? What are you doing? Keep driving. -Double-checking what? -You can't stop here! Keep going! -Tell me. -This! Yes! I told you this morning to call him and you didn't. You told me that at 9 AM, and the guy got stuck now. Tell me how the fuck that's related? Shit happens. Period. -OK, get going. -We're talking. No, you're yelling at me. I'm not yelling at you. This is yelling! -What are you doing? -I want to get out. -Stop it, Lucía. -I want to get out. What are you doing? Lucía, stop it! Where are you going? Come on! -I want to walk. You go. -Come on, Lucía, we're talking. -I want to be alone for a second. -We're talking. Come on. We're not talking, we're fighting, and I don't want to! Don't be ridiculous. It's impossible to talk to you. No. It's impossible for you. -Come on, let's go. -No! I want to walk. -Carrying thousands of dollars? -Shut up! -What? I said dollars. Dollars! -Will you shut up? Come with me, please. Fuck… -Did I hurt you? - Get out. Stop it. It's OK. The car is unlocked and the money's inside. Don't put it there. Don't. I could think it's thrash. Give me a drag. You shouldn't smoke. I don't. Just sometimes. With you I do. I thought you wouldn't come today. The deed signing was put off until tomorrow. Good. One more day to think it over. Let's make a toast. Let's have a drink, come on. Sorry. That one's a real slut… Sorry, I forget there's a lady. Yes, we have a lady here. OK. What should we toast to? -To Luciano. -Luciano? He's going to be a father. Such a snitch. Is that true? -Let's toast then. -Congratulations. -Thanks. Cheers. -Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Come on, drink. I don't want it. You're so in control. When was I out of control? Never. But I'd love to see you go wild. You're more beautiful and mean every day. I'm not beautiful and I'm not mean. You know you're beautiful. -Yeah, you know. -Fucking pricks you two! -Here, have some. It's fine. -I don't want to! -Come on, have a sip. -I don't feel like it. -Have a drink. -They'll come to look for us. -Are you with the law? -Who? You… -Come on, just a sip. -I don't want to. -We are celebrating. -Leave her alone. -She doesn't want to. -I'm talking to her. Have a drink. We are celebrating, it’s a blessing. -Lucía, fish lime sauce for table 22. - Coming. Hurry up, you keep saying "coming". He's being a jerk today. Don't let him make you feel bad. Don't worry. He's the last thing on my mind. Lucía, they're raw, people complain. OK, I'll cook them. But make it quick, we're 50 minutes behind. Why don't you stay here for a while? Our hands are full! What's that? She sends them out raw 'cause you're pushing on us. OK. Come here and tell the costumer that. No, that's your job. You do it. If the kitchen's late, my job is to check why. Understand? You took a reservation for 20 and didn't tell us. -I don't take reservations. -OK, stop. No! We're working calmly in the middle of this chaos! Right, you look very calm. -Shut up, asshole! -Don't talk to me like that! Eat it, idiot! Calm down! What's wrong with you? I'll break the shit out of your face! -Asshole. -Who's the asshole? -Go on with your work. -You go on with yours. Shut up and keep working. Are you OK? -No. What's wrong? -I'm OK. Are you pregnant, Lucía? No. Is there any chance you could be pregnant? No. I had my period just a few days ago. Did this happen before? Yes. Last year. No, at the beginning of this year… I can't remember. Are you under a lot of stress? No. What happened to your arm? A bruise. How did you get it? I hit myself against the edge of the bed. You want me to check it? No, it's just a bruise. Maybe I'm a little nervous, I keep hitting against things. I asked you if you were under some stress and you said no. Well, I'm moving. But that doesn't make me nervous. It's difficult, we are two to decide. My boyfriend and I are buying a new house. In the same neighborhood we are now. His neighborhood, actually. He has everything there… …his friends, his family, they all live near by. It's awful to have your family nearby. Not only his, mine or any family. That's why I wanted to move to another neighborhood. We're doing everything wrong. And that's stressing you out? No… No. Everything… …as if everything was wrong. I don't know, I'm a little weak. Sometimes I don't feel like myself, I'm jumpy. Maybe I need something for that. I mean, to take something for anxiety. No. We have to wait for the test results. You know what? We're always arguing. About anything. Shitty things, like money. I never think about money… …he makes me think about it. He has an issue with money. He's obsessed. It took him a year to accept money to buy the house… …only because it came from my father. What's wrong with that? It's my money, it's a present. I don't understand why I should refuse it. A whole year to convince him, and it's still a problem today. He feels the house won't be his house. That's not true, he put a lot of money for it too. We've been saving for a while. It's awful to live like this. I don't want him to feel like it's not his house. Marcelo never sees my family. They don't get along. My father came to visit us only once… or twice, at most. I don't see them often, either. I'm drifting apart. I think I'm drifting apart from everything. I don't know, this should be a happy moment. We should be happy, but… He hates me. When he looks at me, he hates me. Sometimes, when he talks to me, I feel he hates me. I don't want… …to live like this. You have to eat well, you have to take fluids, water. Sleep well. Don't take anything that causes anxiety, no alcohol. Come back in three days to see the test results. I want time to stand still… … or everything to pass quickly. I can’t think straight. - You are against me now… - No, but I’ve been there - I am against all that. - We are going for… You saw me in the 90s, very actively fighting the police… The Puerto Madero corporation has to be dismantled… …same with Buenos Aires Sur, and no more assigning them directors… Alright, alright, what for? To create a land fund and renovate the shantytown areas. - How much land is there in Buenos Aires? - Lots… You don’t know that, We can’t lie to ourselves… …and there is no way to keep building! You’re so wrong, You’re buying Macri’s bullshit… - No! I’ve lived here for 46 years -Too bad… Like I need you teaching me all about living in a shantytown! Hello. I want to make an appointment. Yes. Lucía Villanova. November 25, 1983. With doctor Julia Martiré. I'm already a patient. I don't remember my health plan number. I think it's 536. No, 537. Yes. 6 PM is perfect. Where’s the money? Hi. Where's the money? I put it elsewhere. Yes, I can see that. Where did you put it? In a safer place. Safer? Safer from me? Why did you move the money? Because the closet in our room doesn't have a lock, and mine does. -You put it all in your closet. -Yes. You're being paranoid. No, I'm not. I come home, you're not in, the money isn't there. I don't know. You don't know what? Do you think I'd take the money? Are you stupid or what? I didn't say that. Just now you thought I took the money. -I didn't think you stole it. -Yes, you did. I went for a run. Do you think I would trick you? Do you? No. Hello. No, his girlfriend. Just a moment. It's for you. Hello. Yes. What's up? Yes. At what time? I'll see what I can do. No, don't worry. Bye. -Who was it? -Nobody. From the school, I forgot to sign some papers. -You have to go? -Yes. Look… If you don't trust me, think it through. If so, we have a problem. What are you doing? Do you forgive me? I'm going now. Yes, I know. I don't want you to go like this. I didn't mean to mistrust you, it's just that… It's OK, everything's fine. Let's not talk about it. Let's talk about it some other time. It's important. I don't want you to think it's important. Look at me. Tell me it's OK. It's hard for you, isn't it? To tell me it's OK? Can you hold me? Not now. Hold me. You'll forget everything, you'll see. Hold me. Is your opinion of me worse than yesterday? No. Should I turn it off? No, leave it. Don't run, Padula. Excuse me. They've been waiting for two hours, we told them you'd come tomorrow, they went mad, so we called you. It's OK. Don't worry. We're doing everything we can, for you two and Leonel not to worry. You're not doing anything. Nothing! If this guy's still here, it means nobody is taking care of it. -We are. -Doesn't look like it. -What's this guy doing here? -Calm down, we're here for this. -To talk things over. -I won't talk to him. He shouldn't work at the school anymore. Aren't you ashamed? No. -You are not ashamed, asshole? -Please, madam. Don't insult me, madam. I'm respectful, but I'll answer you. Answer me, let's see how you deal with an adult. Stop the violence, OK? Let's talk calmly. Sit down and talk nicely. Adriana, sit down, please. Adriana, sit down, please. It's not the first time we've talked to the teacher about what happened. We're all upset… …especially Marcelo. But I take responsibility… …and apologize for what happened to your son. -It's not just because he's my son. -I know. But you can't bully kids like that. I don't bully. - You beat my son. -I didn't beat anybody. You grabbed my son by his the neck. Leonel should be here to explain what happened. Leonel's not going back to school. For the time being… How did it happen? I'm Leonel. Let's see. How did it happen? Not because I say it, but things happened like that. Well, show me. Forget it, Adriana. I want to understand things better, that's all. I want to hear it from him. Leonel and Julián stand there, facing away. I heard Stefanía yelling and thought something was happening. At that moment it wasn't very clear. He's Stefanía, I'm Leonel, so I should be here, right? Show me what you did. Show her. I was three meters behind them… …when I got closer… …I saw they had cut Stefanía's bra with some scissors. I told them to stop it, to leave her alone. But show me how you grabbed my son. Well, your son and Julián ignored me… …and Stefanía started to cry. So I grabbed Leonel's arm to get him out of here. How did you grab him? Why are you laughing? I'm not laughing. I grabbed him like this. Leonel pulled his arm away, and I ran after Julián. Leonel insisted, I couldn't get him out of here and that's when I grabbed him. Like this, by his neck. And I took him out of the classroom. We know it's not the first time they've had this kind of behavior. Leonel is a difficult kid. He is not difficult. Stop saying that, Bocha, my son is not difficult. The only difficult one here is this man. Or is it okay to beat up a kid for misbehavior? Yes or no? Can he beat a 16-year-old because he is difficult? No, you're right. Fuck! You like to turn things around. We're not turning things around. We’re trying to explain. No, you're only justifying! And you can't justify what happened here. Don't give me that shit. -Stop it, Adriana. -Stop what? I just want him to be OK. Sure. I understand, this is a difficult situation. But I give you my word, the professor didn't mean to… I'll try to change. To be better. I'll change. What's wrong, Leonel? Fuck! What are you doing? -What the fuck! -What's wrong with you, asshole? Don`t run away! We'll kill you! Motherfucker! Asshole! We'll kill you! Come here, son of a bitch! Come on, fucker! -Hey, what's up? -Oh, you're here. Yes. Is dad home? No, they went out. -Are you looking for him? -No. Is everything OK? Yes, alright. What's that music? My friend's band. Oscar's. You met him. At Lucre's birthday. Right. You know who else got a band? -Who? -Maya. Maya has a band? And? What does he play? He doesn't play. He's the singer. -Maya sings? -Yes. You know the name of the band? -"The Beautiful Losers". -You're kidding me! No, it's true. "The Beautiful Losers". He's a traitor. Well, ours was called "The Losers of Beauty". It's the same. I gave him permission. It's OK. He sucks, anyway. Yes. And it's a shitty name. He's a fat wanker. Yes. Are you moving today? I was, but we'll do it tomorrow. It's terrible, isn't it? Moving, packing up… If you want me to help you… …just let me know. We are OK. Everything's fine. You're moving nearby? -What? -You are moving nearby. Yes, five blocks away. Five blocks, right here. And how is Lucía doing? There she is. She stayed home, tidying… preparing everything for tomorrow. I like that chick. Yes, I like her too. You know what? She is not snobbish. I like that. And she doesn't smile. She's not one of those girls… who're smiling all the time. That's true. She's not smiling all the time. But when she does, it feels so good. Cool. Oh, you're here. -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -What's up? -Malu… -I'm Marcelo. Hi. Well... Just a minute. -Everything OK? -Yeah, sure. Stay. -OK, I'll stay a little while. -I should go with her. OK. -Let me know, whatever. -Yes, I will. What's wrong? Why did you take out the money? I'm crying. I know. But what is it? I'm crying, I haven't cried in months. No, you're always crying. No, not like this. I put up with it. Maybe you do, but you make me feel like shit. That's awful. Your life is hell. You tell me everything that goes in your mind. No. Not everything, trust me. Well, let's talk. Tell me, why are you crying? What's wrong? I want to split up. How long have you been thinking about this? -I'm talking to you. -Yes, but I don't know what to say. Well, say something. Talk to me. You have to say something. Do you realize what you just said? You can't talk like that without thinking. -I'm not talking without thinking. -You're acting without thinking. We're signing the deed tomorrow, paying for the house. I don't care. I don't care about the deed. I don't care about the house. I don't care about the money. Sure, why should you care about money, you have enough. What did you say? My family doesn't support me. With my shitty job you say I have, I earn more than you. -Yes. Enough to pay the house? -No… Don't meddle in my family's affairs. Your parents can't help you, and that's OK. Mine can. I don't understand. Do I have to feel guilty? I don't feel guilty. -I don't care about the money. -Because you have it. -I have to be poor… -That's not what I am saying. I don't want to argue about your family or mine. I don't know what I'm saying. I can't believe we're talking about this. We were supposed to celebrate. You were going to have a whisky. Why do you do all this if you didn't want to? But I wanted to. When were you going to tell me? How long have you been thinking about it? It's not something I've been thinking and hiding. But I realize we're still in this house. We can't get out of here. We can't move on. We're not moving on, we can't do it together. What are you talking about? Move on to what? I can't believe we're talking of splitting up. I’m not talking about it. That's it. I won't talk about it. -You're thinking about it too. -Oh, yeah? Did I ever mentioned anything about splitting up? Did I? -No. -Then talk for yourself. You'll never say it because you can't. But somebody must say it. You want to have everything, and that's not possible. You don't care about me anymore. Why do you say that? I do care. You're the only thing that matters to me. No, not nice words. I feel bad. It hurts me too. I don't like it. You feel bad when you are with me. And I don't know when you feel all those nice things you tell me. Not when you're with me. -You don't like me. -You love to feel bad! I don't know why you hate me so much. Do as you please. Cry. Victimize yourself, that's all you do. All I do? Are you telling me that all I do is victimizing myself? It's worse than that. You know what? You like to be a victim. Always. You like to suffer and put yourself in that position. You do it always. You like to suffer, feel bad. That's what you like. -Stop it! Everything you're saying is horrible! Leave me. You are leaving me! What if I'd say yes? Doesn't that scare you? That I could say: "OK, let's split up"? Yes. Of course it scares me. It terrifies me. But I can't stay with you out of fear. You could stay with me because you love me. I don't know. I don't know what I'm feeling anymore. Should we go back in? What are you doing? Where are you going? To Flor's. You don't care about the deed or the house, but you think of going to Flor's. I baked her cake, I have to go. Besides, the party is also for me. -But your birthday was ten days ago. -Whatever. I can't go like this. Don't come. We don't have to do everything together. OK. I'm not going. The car keys? One of the window´s scratched. It's in the shop. For a scratched window? The windshield's broken. Take a taxi. Yes, I'll take a taxi. What should I say if they ask about you? Nothing. You don't have to talk about me. Tell them you wanted to go alone, that you can't stand me anymore. Is it true or not? -Wait! It's taken! -I knew it was you. -I have to pee. -But don't enter like this. -Are you done? -Yes. -You go. -Hold the door. I hate it when they enter while I'm peeing. Marcelo's here. He's talking to the guys. Why did you say he wasn't coming? Because he told me he wasn't feeling well. But he's fine. He must be feeling better. -Are you done? -Yes. Daniel, that asshole, called Christian "Nacho". -No! -Can he be that stupid? -What did Christian say? -Nothing. He swallowed it. But he didn't like it at all. What can you do? It's almost impossible not to name him. Yes. That lasted forever, right? Every time we get together, they ask me about him. What can I say… Do you miss him? No. It's strange, but no. I think of him. But I don't miss him, I don't want to see him. We tried very hard, I've had enough. Want some? No. -No, my stomach's not well. -Hold it. -There. -No, wait. A little bit. Hold it. Let me see. Do I look OK? This stays here. Hey, Lu. How come you won't throw a goodbye party for the house? We're not in the mood for parties. We're going through a chaotic moment. -When are you moving? -We'll signing tomorrow. Then we can move. Do you need anything? We'll give you something. A bed? -The fridge is yours? -You want to give them a fridge? I need one. But we have all we need to start. Very well, you have the furniture, a house of your own… …You only need a child, and then you can separate. Don't say that, we have Nino. You won't talk? Tell me how you are, what you're up to. I have to find out through others that you're buying a house. I'm telling you now. What do you want me to tell? That. How are you, how is your life, your job? Fine. Fine? I'm fine too. Just in case you want to ask me tonight. -How are you? -Fine, great. -You came to my mind this week. -Yes? Why? I'm working on a program with the university… …and I'd like to monitor some kids you're working with. I don't work there anymore. Why not? I thought you were in that NGO. Not anymore. It was just a couple of summer classes. It was just a couple of summer classes. It's a pity you don't work anymore with those children. Yes, you had some amazing stories about them. You liked it. It seems he didn't like it that much because he's doing something else. What are you saying? I'm backing you up. You were not that much into it so you quit. You don't need to back me up. This is not a trial. I didn't say anything bad. I said you're doing something else now. What? He doesn't do it anymore. He only works at the school. Well, he still has the same supportive spirit. Yes. He's more focused on violence, doesn't work with children anymore. He carries a gun now. How come you carry a gun? I'm not. -You have a gun at home. -Do you have a gun? -What kind of gun? -A .38, short. You told me you'd throw it away. It belonged to my grandfather. I won't throw it away. You can give it away. It's already a gift. I got it from my grandpa. I won't give it away. He inherited it from his grandpa, he didn't choose to have it. But he chooses to have it at home. What can he do? Throw it on the street? -He can throw it in the river. -What can you do with a gun? If you see a gun you pick it up just like that? You'd pick up just any gun? Yes. Are you crazy? If I'm alone, maybe not. But if I'm with him, sure. -Just imagine the situation. It's not that easy. It's not the gun but its meaning. ... I mean, the gun as a symbol. Right, Lu? Maybe, yes. -No, Lu. Forget it. -It's only a minute. -Where do you keep it? -At home, in a closet. In a shoe box. It's funny. You told me you took it to your parents' house. That you'd already taken it. And that your brother put it in the closet. -You lied to me. -Maybe I thought about it. What does it matter now, Lucía? I don't like guns. Neither do I, nobody likes guns. You're being childish. You hold it all inside and now you throw it on me? I'm talking to you. Look at me! Look at me, I'm talking to you! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Why did you come? -I came to pick you up. -No, you came to provoke me. Why do you come here? What's wrong? You were going to stay alone in the apartment. You know what? You can't stand to be alone for a single moment. What do you want from me? I don't know. You're mad at me. No. Are you afraid of me? Are you afraid of me? Are you sure? I'm not afraid of you. Are we separated? Because if we are what are we doing here? - That's what I'm asking you. - Oh, we are! You said "I want to split up". When? It's not “I want to split up”, It's “I'm breaking up with you”. What can I do with what you're saying? I can't do anything. If you want it, then it will be so. So when do you want to get separated? Come here, stay with me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me, and keep it low. Stay here. You'll have to stay here and talk things over. What's wrong, Lucía? Tell me! What is it? Lift your arms… Listen to me, Lucía! Lift your arms, come on! -It's over. -What's over? Tell me, what is it? Nothing, I'm OK. What? Are you OK? Tell me, what is it? I'm fine, it's OK. It happened earlier too. - When? At home? - No, at the restaurant. I spit up blood. -What? Did you spit up blood now? -No, not now. Can't you see I didn't? You're drinking alcohol. What's the matter with you? It's nothing. Finished. It's blood, Lucía. You have to go and see a doctor. I did. You went to see a doctor? You didn't tell me. And what did he say? I had some tests done. I'll have the results next week. But he said it's nothing serious. You can go, I'm fine. I know I can go. It's true, I didn't tell you. Terrible, isn't it? But… We're apart, I can't talk to you. You're not supportive. Why do you say that? I am supportive. We can be supportive. Be there for each other. I'm here, I came to get you. Then why don't you hold me? You can't, you don't feel it. You see I'm not good and you can't hold me. -Like you enjoyed it. -I feel bad too. I also need to be held. It's not so easy to hold somebody without thinking, like you want to. ´Cause you are not really holding me... ...you don't feel it. You don't really feel it. You don't want to hold me. -You are mocking me. -No. …you hate me No, I love you. See? You're mad at me. What are you doing? Are you leaving? You left. You left me alone. You took off. What are you doing with the money? It's my money, I'll take it. -It's not... -It's mine. Let go! -Yes? All of it? -Let go, I'm taking it with me. The money you hate so much. I'll take it with me.
