Safety's off, little brother. Watch him. Watch him, little more. Bingo. Not the worst. I definitely wouldn't have minded a few more hands out here. Each year we're a little older and the deer just seem to keep gettin' heavier, huh? Yeah, it seems about like that. You know who I would've liked to have out here with us on the hunt? Roy. - Here we go. - Seriously? Roy was welcome to be here. You act like I'm frustrated and I don't have a reason to be. He had more potential than either one of us. You gotta get off that shit, man. It's-- He's our brother. And why are you givin' me a hard time about it? He's out there, 40 years old, broke, drivin' coast to coast in some big rig that's not even his. It's a cheap-ass company loaner. Ain't got a pot to piss in! Look, if he's havin' a good time, then whatever. Let it be. You think he's happy? That's his vision of happy? He could've had a career in the military, which I encouraged him to do. He pursues MMA, he gets hurt one time, and he just quits! He's still dwellin' on the past instead of livin' in the present. Wow. Beautiful speech. Really. It was great, but next time, how 'bout you tell that one to Roy? Be a good big brother yourself. -I am a good big brother. -Ugh. I've gotta tell you these things so that you'll pass it on to him. He doesn't even return my damn phone calls half the time. Act like you know everything! Come on, man, let's go! Come on! Bro! Bro, you're late! Let's go! Ugh, man! What the fuck? This here's a long drive into town. - Okay. - Let's smash some motherfucker's face. All right, good. I like to hear that. I'm gonna have a good time with this pretty little lady. - Huh? - Hey, Roy boy. I'll let 'em know you're here. -Hey, beautiful. -Hi, baby. Yes, yes, Roy! Yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes! Yes, Roy, fuck me! Yes, yes! - Oh! - All right, guys. All right, champ, you're up! Holy shit! Oh, for fuck's sake, Roy! You're tellin' me your dick can't wait till after the fuckin' fight? Come on, man, Pallazo's got a lot of money ridin' on this! Dude! Come on, man! You gotta win this one! Come on, get your ass out there! Jeez! He's coming! Literally! Is that the best you got, JD? Yes! Yeah! We're gonna go party tonight, baby. Roy, watch out! Shit! Ow! Yo, get up, Roy! Get up! Fuck! Roy, Roy, Roy. Oh, Roy. What am I gonna do with you? You know, you cost me a lot of money tonight. Losing focus. Your punk ass used to be my best. The fuck happened to you? Look, come on, man. I've won you more money in the last four years than you lost tonight. I'll make it up to you. Gimme a chance, man. I ain't gonna lose again. Lose again? I'll tell you what. No, no, no! No, please! Please! Please, no! - Who's this bitch? - Please, no! No, no! You know this bitch, this bitch you was fuckin'! Yo, shut that bitch up! Yo, shut her ass up! - No! Motherfucker! - Sit your ass down. See how this shit work? Less than an hour ago, you were fucking her brains out and now I just blew her fuckin' brains out. I don't give a fuck! I have the power. I have the fuckin' power! So try me, boy! Come, come at me, bro. Come get some. Now, listen up carefully. You're gonna make this up to me. I require your truck for transport. Don't worry, you will be well financially compensated. You got that? - What are we doin'? - Lemme show you somethin'. I bet you thought it was drugs, huh? Yeah. Frankly speaking, I did. So what, you want me to transport stones? Diamonds, Roy. These are some of the rarest diamonds on the planet. Where the hell'd you get this? Who the fuck do you think you are that I'm gonna tell you where I get my merchandise? The fuck's wrong with you? This shit, man... Pure and uncut. What do you want me to do? Your only job is to transport these diamonds securely and secretly from point A to point B, unharmed. And when you do that, you'll be one million dollars richer, boy. Come again? A million in cash. I don't understand why you want me to do this. Get one of these fuckin' goons to do it. Yeah, fair enough. I'ma give you three reasons why you the man for the job. Number one, you're a professional seasoned truck driver, with a great driving record. I've checked it out. So this should be like any other trip for you. And number two, you got a brother, right? Which one? That's right, that's right. You got two. What's your oldest brother's name, the, um, one with the-the beautiful wife and the-- and the two daughters? The-the average Joe, right? What does Joe have to do with this? Look, motherfucker, do I have to spoon-feed this common sense to you? Do you have a motherfucking wife and kids? Does your other brother Danny have a wife and kids? No. I need collateral! And Joe's wife and kids are gonna be my motherfuckin' collateral - in case you fuck this shit up! - Fuck you! Hey, whoa, whoa! You don't wanna try that bullshit on me, man. Believe me. You don't want none of this. It won't end well for you. And third, you owe me, motherfucker. You're lucky I'm even tryin' to pay you for this shit. Why you wanna make it more complicated than what it is? It's just a simple delivery from Vegas to Baja. Yeah. The problem is, Joe and I don't really see eye to eye. It's gonna be pretty hard to convince him to take this ride. Well, that's your problem. But I just gave you one million reasons why you can to convince him for your freedom. And if I say no? You don't got a choice, motherfucker. Great. Three hundred channels and nothing to watch. I can watch TV, talk to you, or go to bed, huh? Pick up Joe. Think you're gonna find out I know how voicemail works too, little brother. Leave a message if it's important. ...is not available. At the tone, please record-- James, this big guy is goin' nowhere fast. Whoo-ee! That oil line there is fubar. Uh, now we need to clean this up. You wanna come over and watch the game tonight? - Megan's making her killer lasagna. - Oh. I'd love to, but Joe asked me to help out with the family at the ranch today. All right, well, you have fun with that. I'm gonna be goin' down hardcore on my wife's lasagna. All right, well, you enjoy that, buddy. I will. You're not sayin' no next week. Your ass is mine on my couch. That sounds so wrong... in so many ways. You don't need to make it awkward. I'm outta here, bud. Ugh. Oh, shoot. Roy Mason... ...is not available. At the tone-- Damn, Roy, how come you never answer? - G.I. Danny! How are you, brother? Huh? Not bad, just got off work. I figured you guys might need some help. I-- As a matter of fact, you're reading my mind. The girls have picked out the biggest Christmas tree and I can't carry that sumbitch by myself. That's what I'm here for. Hey, um, by the way, you haven't heard from Roy lately, have you? The sumbitch called me last night about two a.m., right as I was going to bed. I didn't talk to him. Sent him to voicemail. You didn't talk to him? Why-- - Why not? What if it was an emergency? - Oof. What's with the drama? An emergency with our brother on a weekday at two a.m.? He'd been drinkin'. There's your emergency. What if he's in trouble? Why-- why not? If he's in trouble, he would've called you. He would've called me back. I know, but just-- We don't go this long without hearing from him, you know? I get a little worried sometimes. Ah, forget about it. I'm gonna go get inside, clean up, change, and see if the girls need some help. - All right? - Yeah, I'm not worried. Go make yourself useful. Hey! Good to see you, little brother. Yeah, you too, big bro. There you go. Oh, these look good. - There you go. - No. I still can't believe you girls got me in the kitchen helping you today. You know you're in it for the cookies. Guilty. Well, speak of the devil. What's up, brother? - Uncle Roy! - Uncle Roy! - Girls. - Mmm! Oh, you're just in time for the cookies! They're so good! You have to try one. Welcome, Roy. Long time no see. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Just you and me and a little peace and quiet, huh? Oh, I spoke too soon. What is it, Dan-bo? Whatever Roy was calling about last night, was important enough... - Oh, this again-- - ...for him to show up today. He's here? Yeah, he's back at the house having cookies with Laura and the kids. Doesn't sound all that important to me, little brother. He knows I'm out here working, he stops at the house for a snack for himself. - What a surprise. - Yeah. - You should come on in, see him. Say hi. - I could-- - I will happily see him. - Say hi. You want me to stop working and head on in? I assumed he would come out here. This is what we used to do as brothers. We used to take care of this place together! What the hell, Joe? Come on. Why can't you be the bigger man? I mean, just come in. How do you know he even wants something? He disappears every time it's convenient, then he comes crawling back every time he needs something. You think today is different? Look, Danny, I've been bailing him out for years, but things are different now. I got a family, the girls, you, the livestock. People count on me. He had potential. I take a look at you, you listened to me in all fairness. I gave you good advice as your mentor. Now you're in the military, you're doing a great job. He's a vagabond fightin' people for scraps outside of truck stops. You think he's here for any other reason than to ask me for money or a place to stay? What's up, boys? What's all the ruckus? Talkin' about you, little brother. Nice to see ya. You called at two a.m. and now you popped out here and I got a feelin' it's 'cause you need something. Am I close? - Man, fuck you. - Man, fuck you! - Should've never came here. - Yeah, I agree with that! You never were invited! - Joe. - Look at your face! You had a hard enough time with some guy for 20 bucks... - Fuck you! Fuck you! - ...you wanna say "fuck you" to me? - Stop. - How your fuckin' face is gonna look? Roy! Roy, wait! Stop. Hey, come on, man. Get off me, I gotta go. Why even bother coming here if you're just gonna leave like this, huh? It's why he doesn't want you around in the first place. You wanna come with me for a couple days? Sorry, what? Gotta make a transport over the border in Baja. I was gonna ask Joe if he wanted to come and squash some old feuds, but... shit, I couldn't be more wrong about that. How many days you say? Uh, down and back, it'd be three or four days. Well, yeah, I might be able to find somebody to cover me at the base. - So you wanna go? - Yeah, let's do it. Jeez, yeah, why not? I mean-- I mean, jeez, if you can't bond with one brother, what's wrong with me? I mean, I'm your brother too, and I haven't had a chance to just talk with you like we used to back in the day. Ah, fuck, it'll be fun. - Let's go. - I miss you, bro. - The Mason brothers, on the road. Hey. Sorry about Joe. He uh... He cares, he does, he just has a different way of showing it. Joe needs to let that shit go, man. He knows I couldn't be there. Glad to be out here with you, bro. Gotta make a quick stop, get a quick buck. Hittin' the craps table? - This is it? - Yeah. You're not here to buy drugs, are you? I'm not buyin' drugs. Trust me, you're gonna like it. Better not. Who the fuck's this? My little brother Danny. I'm just fuckin' around, mate. They're clear to go down. Gentlemen. You're gonna have a good time. All right. We'll see. But if any weird shit goes down here... I'm not doing it, I'm out, leavin'. Long way home. Well, well, well, look who's on time. Come on out, boys. Good for you. Look who's here. - Roy Mason, how you been? - Hey, brother. - Been a while. - My-- my little brother Danny. Hi. Lucious. Lucious Valentine. Let's take him on a tour. What we do here is we provide a service for individuals such as politicians, high-ranking officials, you know. You know politicians? - Yeah. - Max. Merry Christmas, kid. Here's something to suck on. Candy cane. Thanks. - Hey, this is my brother Danny. - Hi. Take good care of him for me, would ya? - Y'all ready for some more action? - Yeah! - Are you ready? All right! - Yeah! Let's move on to our next fight. We got Barney Boy! And our next fighter is Big Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! You ready? You ready? Fight! - Yeah! Come on! Duke! Duke! Let's play! Let's play! Let's play! Come on! Okay, folks. Who's ready to fight this champ right here, right now, for the double bonus? And remember, since this is the "double bonus, winner takes all" round, the knockout must come within the first round in order for the fighter to win. Who's in? All right! We got Roy Mason here, everyone. Don't fight this guy, he's huge. Glad to have you back, Roy. Roy. I heard of your bitch ass. This is gonna be a very exciting one, folks. Both Roy and Big Duke here are undefeated in our underground fight league. Let's see who takes home the glory tonight. Are you ready? Let the fights begin! You ready? You ready? Fight! He won! That's my brother! The new undisputed champion! Oh, my God. My head. Man. Maybe we should've played craps last night. Looks like you got lucky. Where are we going to pick up this load? Up here around the corner. Picking up a load for Pallazo. That was easy. Stay here and I'll see what's up. This shit you're transporting legal? Legal enough. - Roy? - That's me. You're late. I'm here, aren't I? That's your brother in the truck? Yeah, that's him. How long is this shit gonna take to load up? Roy. We're about to load 50 million dollars worth of rare uncut diamonds into your guys's shithole truck. It's gonna take as long as it's gonna take. You guys got a problem with that or something, Roy? Nah, no problem. Good. Well... You comin'? Yeah. Andiamo , Roy. Don't mind them. They're just-- just working. So here's the load. All packaged up and ready to go. I'll get the boys over here and get it loaded up and you'll be on your way. This some kind of a joke? I'm here for diamonds, not to haul your fuckin' groceries around. Here. Look at this. These are all diamonds in here. The tea is just the front. So you know you are responsible for all that now? And, uh, you know what'll happen if this doesn't get to Baja in the next 24 hours, do you? I'm well aware. Good, 'cause Pallazo doesn't fuck around. I'm well aware of that as well. - Good. - All right. Roy. The, uh, coordinates to the drop-off location are inside this. Got it. Let your boss know I'll be there in the morning. Everything okay? Yeah. Just gotta get this load across the border before morning. All right. You good to drive all night? Are you seriously asking me that? It's what I do for a living, little bro. Touché. Touché. Hey. Wake up, sleepyhead. I'm gonna get some gas here. You want anything? Yeah. I gotta pee so bad, my back teeth are floatin'. It's around the corner. Lemme know if there's anything else you need. All right, thanks. You need anything? - No, no, I'm good. I'm good. - No gumballs? Yes! Aw, shit. Not today, not today! Come on! I got this. Not today, assholes! Come on! Shit! Oh, shit! Oh, God! No! No! Roy! Roy! What the hell just happened? It's fucked. I'm fucked. Roy, who were those guys? We're fucked. Roy, dude, come on. We gotta get outta here. I think that's the clerk's car. Come on, we need to find the keys. Let's go. Come on, come on, let's go. Check the car. What the fuck?! All right, Roy. What the fuck is in that truck? And who the fuck were those guys? Roy? Why the fuck were we getting shot at? What the fuck is going on, Roy? Get in the car. Take this. We gotta go. Asshole! Tell me what the fuck is going on! You're gonna shoot these motherfuckers. There they are! Who? - Who is that? - The gun loaded? We gotta get 'em. Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers! You're gonna get us fucking killed. Hold it together. Danny, grab the wheel. Grab the wheel! What the fuck? What the fuck?! You're not getting away, motherfuckers! Shoot them! Get out, get out, get out! Roy, what the fuck is in that truck? Fifty million in diamonds. We gotta get off the main road before those guys or the cops come back. I'll fill you in on the walk. Fifty million? Fuck! Don't fucking kill me, man! Just don't kill me! This guy got some balls, I tell you that. So you think you can fuck me and not get fucked with? You should have fuckin' known better! You seen what the fuck I do to people that fuck me over! But yet you still tried to fuck me! You fucked with the wrong motherfucker! Fuck you! Right in the nuts! Y'all see that shit? Right in the balls, man! Did y'all see that? - Right in the balls! - A call for you. Talk to me. No luck. We're unable to reach the owner of the station and, uh, the security cams here seem to not be working. What about the abandoned truck and car up the road? We have a response team already examining the site. This is an MP5 casing. There's about a hundred more over there. This was not a drive by. These guys were pros. I have a feeling we'll have more evidence over there. All right? You stay here, run the show, I'm gonna head up there and check it out. Okay. Copy that. Hey, it's me. Yeah, I'm at the usual spot. Okay. Right. - Evening. - Detective. - Anything interesting? - No, nothin' at all. There's gotta be something in this bag. I guess we'll hold up here for the night. Then, uh, be out at first light. Start walkin'. No. No Baja margaritas. This will do. Gimme that bag. Knock yourself out. I will see you in the morning. Whew! That's cold! A little cold. Cold out here in the wintertime. Cut the shit, JD, and tell me what you got. Okay, Agent Brody, listen. Here-here's the thing, man. I mean, listen. I don't know-- Pallazo, he's out of his mind. I don't know if I can do this anymore. That guy, he's crazy. I watched him blow a-a young girl's brains out right in front of me, man! I mean, this-this-- This is, uh, not the kind of work I can do, you understand? I-I'm not cut out for it. You gotta get-- Oh, shit! Oh! What'd you do that for, man?! Fuck, I'm bleeding! Now listen to me, you son of a bitch. Fuck-- Jesus! You ever hear of Witness Protection? - Yeah. - Good. Now you're gonna tell me everything you got on Pallazo and his crew. Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Welcome back home to papa bear. Joe was right about you. You're so fucking selfish. You know, I was the dumbass to think that you actually cared about your family. Man, but instead you had to put us all at risk over some really stupid shit. Julian Pallazo is a very powerful man. He'd have killed us if he wanted to. Those guys must've been tracking the diamonds for a while now. With a load like that, it would've been smart for them to put a tracker in one of those crates. Hello? No! Beth! Ashley! Girls! Girls! Laura! Not a signal, baby. "Come ride with me for a couple days. It'll be fun. Go to Baja, get some margaritas and Baja bitches." This doesn't look like fuckin' margaritas to me! I'm never riding with you again. You gettin' any service up here? No, none. I bet over in that little town there we'll get something. Let's check it out. Man, I hate all-nighters. And the sound of my baby. What's on your mind? We need to search within a 25-mile radius around that semi-crash. If anyone were to escape on foot, they couldn't have gotten farther than that since this morning, right? If they had, they would probably have to be sprinting nonstop. Oh. Thank you. I'll call it in. Have some breakfast and coffee. - Yeah. Later. - We have a long day ahead. This is Detective Johnson. I need to set up a perimeter within a 25-mile radius around that semi-crash. Detective Garcia and myself are on the way too. Thank you. - Let's go. - But what-- What about having-- having the burrito? We'll do it later. It's gonna be a long day. Mm. If only this thing would work and we could fly right out. Hey, look at this place. I don't know. If those guys wanna come back and finish the job, this is the place to do it. Crazy, huh? You getting any service yet? Let's see if we can get some service. Yeah. Let's find out. Anything? I've got five missed calls from Joe. Call him back. It's ringing. Danny. Hey, buddy, the girls are gone. Beth, Ash, Laura, everybody. The house is a mess, I think somebody was here. - Joe? - Joe. Roy? Why am I talking to you? Where's Danny? I think I know who has 'em. Roy, if anything happens to my family, I will kill you myself! Brother or not, you little fuck, this is your last mistake! They're callin' now, I'm gonna put 'em on speakerphone, okay? Where's my diamonds, motherfucker? There-- There was kind of an incident last night when we were getting fuel, and... three SUVs and some guys robbed us. I'll find 'em. Just don't hurt my family. Don't worry, don't worry. I didn't kill 'em. Not yet. Not only did you lose my diamonds, but you lied to me! And I don't tolerate liars! You don't think I know that you took the wrong fuckin' brother? A deal is a fuckin' deal! You fucked up! You know know what? You know know what? I tell you what. You know I like to gamble. You got 48 hours from this very minute to find my fuckin' diamonds. You won't get the money, but I might let the girls live. Only if everything goes smoothly and you don't play no more of those little silly-ass tricks again. You got exactly 48 hours to bring my diamonds back. You got that, motherfucker? Now go! Hey, Julian! Julian! The game's gonna go like this. I'm not gonna do a goddamn thing except kill you! Danny, pin drop me your location. The three of us are getting my family back! What the fuck did you get us into, Roy? Huh? What the fuck is going on? First you get me shot at, and then you get the family kidnapped?! What the fuck is wrong with you, Roy? You trying to get us all killed? Fuck you! Goddamn it! Danny. Danny! Fuck you, Roy! Fuck you! Danny! Fuck! Fuck! - Yo. - Yes? - Keep an eye on those girls. - Yes. I got a feeling this shit ain't gonna work out the way I planned. Understood. The old valley abandoned town? Yup. This is a good vantage point. If I were a criminal, this would be a great place to hide out. See? Check it out. Do you think those guys had anything to do with what happened last night? I don't know. But we can't just make an arrest without any evidence. We're just gonna have to wait and see what they're up to. Let's stake it out. You really fucked up this time. You've been doing it a lot... but this time you really fucked up. I've stuck my neck out for you more times than I can count. I've stood up for you against Joe. I always had your back. This time... But... you gotta fix it. We gotta do whatever we need to do to get this guy, get the family back. After that... After that, we'll see. Joe should be here soon. Hey. Look here. Get up. Ride's here. Oh, hey, check this out. Here comes the target. - Hey, thank God, Joe. - Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop! Stop, stop! Stop! - It's all your fuckin' fault! - Enough! We can't be fighting against each other right now! - I wouldn't even be in this fucking spot! - Stop! - We got bigger fish to fry. - I deserve that. - Okay? - Where are they? Who the fuck are these people? - Hold on. - Well? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God, guys! Oh, my God! All right, they're alive. They're alive! Focus! Focus, guys, they're alive! Where are they? Where does this piece of shit hang out? - Did you hear anything from him? - A bar? A restaurant? His friends? Think! - You had to have heard-- heard something. - Oh! I don't know-- Or some mansion in the northwest area around here. - Pallazo mansion. - Pallazo mansion, that's where we're lookin' first, boys! Gear up! Fuck! That's our cue. Let's see what they're doing. Huh. All right. Danny, set up sniper and cover us. Dickhead, you're with me. - Dude, what the fuck? - What? Dude, you don't have a fuckin' maid service to come clean up after you. That's what the custodians are for. I'm in position. Oh-- Grazie mille. Roman Empire shit. Oh! How are you? Buongiorno. Oh! Paulie, what the fuck? Paulie, didn't I tell your sorry ass not to bother me while I'm having company? Your punk ass is supposed to be watching the Mason girls back at the mines. You better have a fuckin' good goddamn reason why you fuckin' up my day! What's up, wiseass? Why you ain't fuckin' talkin'? What the fuck is so goddamn important that you gotta cockblock on me? What the fuck is so funny, boy? You got some motherfuckin' problem or somethin'? You shut the hell up, old man. You've served your purpose long enough. This is my blood family. Now it is my turn to start taking over shit! You're not even a real Pallazo. My uncle, my great-uncle, loved you like a son. I am godfather Anthony's son. Sure him and Sofia adopted me, but I loved him. I loved him more than your so-called blood family ever have, and he knew that enough to trust me with the family's legacy. And not you spoiled, pathetic, millennial fucks! Drop it and turn around, motherfuckers! Now! - Easy, stupid. - Hey-- - Slow down, big guy. - Hey, hey-- Hey, hey, I got your bitches. I got your bitches! You don't think I'm gonna kill you? You'll never see 'em again. You as tough as you are ugly? What, you think you can take me? - You wanna gimme a shot? - Put it down. The other one too, motherfucker. I'm not stupid. You questioning my honor? I just want my girls back. Get the fuck outta here! I'm the motherfucking man around this bitch! This is my diamond! This is my shit! You feeling that, Roy? Huh? Fuckin' kill me then! You'll never see those little bitches again! Huh? You think you have the guts to do it? You're a fucking coward and you know it. Get the fuck outta here! I run this shit! This is my fuckin' shit! I'm the fuckin' king! Hi, king. You fucking bastard! Paulie! They took out Julian! I had to shoot these motherfuckers! Take him back to the mine. Let's have some fun with him. Ugh, fuck. - They got away before I could get to 'em. - I see that. - You okay? - I'm alive, little brother. I know where they're goin'. Come on. Hey, Jimmy. Rally on me. We got a little situation. What's up? Grab all the firepower and gear you can. Meet at the coordinates I'm sending. Shit. Right on time. Jimmy. Attaboy! This is Special Agent Brody. I'm working with local law enforcement. I'm sending you coordinates. I need task force on my position ASAP. Buongiorno. Good morning. Welcome to my world, Roy. Look at all these toys! Isn't it fun? Huh. Let's let the games continue, no? You know, this land has been in my family for years. A couple years out, some buddies and I went out here, playing with explosives, having a blast. You see that shit? That's sexy shit! - Paulie. - Yeah? Look at this shit. We're gonna be rich, man! Bellissima. After realizing that we were standing on my family's diamond mine... I, uh... You know, I iced my buddy. Dispiace , bro. Fratello , I'm sorry. God forgive me, bro. I loved him too, you know? His grave is on the land. Sometimes I go over there and smoke a fat joint in loving memory of him. Why the hell you telling me this? I don't give a shit about your diamonds. I'm just here to get my family back. Exactly. You don't care about the fuckin' diamonds. Your dumb ass would not be in this stupid fucking situation if you actually cared about the diamonds! Who the fuck on earth leaves 50 million dollars worth of diamonds unattended in a truck in some dump-ass gas station like that?! It's stupid and fucking irresponsible! Vaffanculo! It was you. You fuckin' set me up! Yeah, you're right! I did set you up. Yeah, you're correct. I'm a very methodical guy. Too bad that your brothers couldn't join us, but you do have the honors, I'm telling you, of having the lives of your sister-in-law and your nieces in your very own hands. If you fight this guy in front of you, I'll let you go. I'm a man of my word. You see, the thing is, Roy... Nobody fucks with me! So I don't have any fuckin' time to waste, so let the fight fuckin' begin! I can't promise the condition you'll be in afterwards, but... it is what it is. Uncle Roy, no! Stop! Stop! Oh, no! Roy, no! Shut up! This is sexy! Let's go! Fuck you! Fuck, man. Congratulations, Roy. You killed him. What the fuck? Who the fuck is this?! Who the fuck?! This way! Come on, sir, we need to get out of here!
