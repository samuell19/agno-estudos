Hey! I'm Amber. Amber, Amber. Hi, I'm Amber. Hi, I'm Amber. Ted Hooper. Won't you come in? He mostly likes to keep to himself. I'm busy. Coming in, okay? Kevin? Hey buddy. This is Amber. She's gonna be watching you tonight, okay? Hey. So you're leaving me with a stranger? Don't be silly, Kevin. It's just for tonight. What if I fall asleep and... Kevin, I'll be home as soon as my date's over. Now come on down, okay? Ronnie will be here soon. So Charlotte's gonna be my new mom now? Lighten up, kid. We're gonna be best buds, okay? I promise. I'll pinky promise. That's stupid. Yeah. I guess it is We'll let you get back to it. So, let's get the sob story out of the way. My wife died about a year ago. My God. I'm so sorry. Don't be. You didn't kill her. Unless you did? I'm joking. The point is Kevin's been a little moody since then. I can imagine. He's a very sensitive boy. Bad thoughts, nightmares, monsters hiding in his closet. Just make sure nothing gets him too worked up. Mmm-hmmm. Well this is embarrassing. Who knows what evil lurks in your small town, in your neighborhood or even your own home. I forgot I left this on. What happens when a house of God becomes an unholy nightmare? A simple case of arson or irrefutable proof of demonic possession? Join me on my travels as I seek out rare artifacts of the occult. Take this suit of armor worn by the world's first ghost hunter, Sir Barnabus Lord of Kent. Is that her? The Weeping Widow? Find out tonight on Ted Hooper: Paranormal Investigator. It's called a sizzle reel. I'm waiting to hear back from some investors. It's really something. Well, it's my life's work. The occult, the macabre, the bizarre. I live for this stuff. So what's the scariest thing you've ever seen? I've never seen an event firsthand. Not once in 20 years. You believe that? One day, right? Would you like a drink? Whiskey? I'm having whiskey. Oh, I'm not 21 so... I was not 21 once too. I would actually love a drink. So, you got any references? Oh um, well all of my numbers were on my old phone which I lost. Don't you hate that? Oh, what a drag. Nobody in the neighborhood, though? Nobody local who might know you? Um, well I'm still sort of new in town, and I haven't really had a chance to build up my client base yet. Pretty spooky, huh? It's my office. It's locked. Off limits. So that's where the goodies are? Full of treasure, naturally. Like valuables? Like valuables. Sure. Well, the ambiance is um... It is, yeah. That's Finley. You'll love him. Sometimes Finley gets a little rowdy outside, but the neighbors never complain. You'll barely notice he's here. Pool, pool-house. A lot more fun in the summer, but there you are. So, there's not much cell service out here, huh? Well, it's a little bit old school, but there's the landline. And there's a trick with cell phones. Okay. Come on, I'll show you. Gotta get suited up for the date anyway. You can usually get reception in there. Feel free to check it out. Okay. Yeah, it works great. So, Amber. About tonight. If Charlotte asks, you sat for Mr. Gilford up the street. Danny and Sarah are his kids. Very well-behaved. Okay. Oh. That's them. Finish your drink in here, okay? Oh. Hey. Hey! Great to see you. Ronnie, my man! Hi, Ted. Cool house. It's pretty big. Not bigger than my dad's house though. Ronnie. Don't be a brat. And who's this cutie? Amber. Pleased to meet you. Charlotte LaFontaine. I'm just gonna go grab Kevin, okay? So you like sitting? You good with kids? Yes. I usually sit for Mr. Gilford's kids down the street. Danny and Sarah. Very well-behaved. Well, don't you worry about this one, 'cause he's gonna be on his best behavior. Now what have we been learning, Ronnie? My actions have consequences. He likes to mix it up a bit, but he's harmless. Just make sure you keep an eye on him. Okay. I know you're upset that I'm leaving, so I'll understand if you wanna go to bed early. I'll be home by midnight. If anything goes wrong, Amber will help. You're gonna be just fine. Look who I found! Hey, Kevin! Shall we? Yes, we shall! X marks the spot, Ronnie. X marks the spot. He doesn't like to say I love you. Hmm, who does? Ronnie. X marks the spot. Okay? I left money for pizza in there. And remember what I said about my office. Strictly off-limits. No problem. You guys have fun, okay? I thought they'd never leave. Okay, I need to make a phone call so you two just go hang out and watch some TV or something, okay? Hey. You alone? Yeah, parents are gone. Just waiting on the kids. Well you better hurry. I don't have all night. Hey, bring your kit. I've got a job for you when you get here. It's locked. You need the key. Think the babysitter's got it? I could seduce her. Ladies love me. Those are my dad's artifacts. He'd never trust them with her. He loves them too much. We're gonna get inside. I mean, what's the worst that could... Pretty creepy, right? Little jumpy, Ronald? Whatever. You just surprised me. Aren't you gonna get us pizza? You have to buy us pizza. Ahhh! What a baby. Come on. Cheese. You can't just get cheese. You have to get pepperoni. He can pick it off. It'll have pepperoni grease. Yeah, it will have pepperoni grease, Ronald. Stop calling me Ronald. Okay, we'll get half and half. But that's such a waste of m... And half cheese. Yep. Thanks. It smells funny. Like my uncle. Ronnie! I like the way you smell. Like home. What's this for? Ronnie! Ronnie, give that back. Give it back. It's complicated, okay? Can't be that complicated. You are a credit to your gender, kid. Okay, pizza's not gonna be here for a while, so let's watch some TV. Yeah? Dad turned off the cable cause no one bought his ghost show even though it was professional quality. Okay, okay. Umm. How about hide & seek? Yeah! I don't wanna play. Come on. Don't be a loser. Mmm, don't. Kevin, you are more than welcome to sit down here and talk with Ronnie all night. Yeah, okay I'll play. Okay, awesome. It's a big house so I will count to 100. Do your worst fellas. One, two, three, four, five. I already told you it's locked. Where's your dad's room? Ummm. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 39, 100. Ready or not. We're supposed to be hiding. And seeking. Shut up. Oh shit. She's coming. Get out. It's locked, you dumbass. Hey. I've been calling you. Yeah, I was gonna call you. Uh-huh. I'm out in the sticks. There's no service. Where? I thought maybe we could hang out tonight. Okay, listen. The thing is I gotta leave town soon, like tomorrow. When were you gonna tell me? We've only been hooking up for two months, okay? Grow up. Yeah the best two months of my life. Let's talk about this, okay? I gotta go, okay? I love you. I love you. I like you. I love you. Bye. Guys, pizza's here. Game over. Hiders win. Oh. Hello. It's you. I was watching you earlier. Right. You waved. We waved at each other, yes. I'm Vincent. Amber, I'm just babysitting. Well, I just wanted to stop by. Couldn't help but notice earlier that you have a kind aura. Thanks. That's really nice. Have a Merry Christmas, okay? Christmas. Right. Did you know that the pagans actually pioneered the idea of a wintertime celebration of rebirth long before the so called savior was even allegedly born? I'm sorry, is this like a weird religious thing? Yes. But most things are, you know, if you go back far enough. Okay, well thanks. Oh, I also have lots of board games if you need help with the little ones. I think I'll be okay, but thank you. I actually should get back, so... Well if you need anything, anything, I'm right next door in the garage. I'm free all night. Okay. I think I can handle it. Take care. Okay. Bye. It would be really nice if we could exchange information... Can you take a hint? Can't believe I couldn't find you guys. Guess you just suck at hide & seek. Ronnie, did your mom ever teach you that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all? Fuck. I like your drawings. Why? They're horrible. I hate them. So don't make them. My doctor says I should draw whenever I'm emotionally vulnerable. Does that help? Drawing? Seeing a doctor. Not really. I mostly show them my drawings, and then they tell my dad I have antisocial tendencies. X marks the spot, Ronnie X marks the spot, okay? Oh, you little shit. You shit fucker. Fuck. Fuck. All right. Time for bed. Let's go. You got it. Come on, Kev-o What if I clean? Can I stay up longer? Kevin, you're not in trouble. You just need to go to bed. Come on. Go fetch, Finley. Kids in bed yet? Yeah, the kids are asleep. Is this your phone? No, it's the house line. Oh. Can you bring a truck? A truck? Why? It's a big house. Just in case. Yeah, I've got a connect. What's the address? It's 187 Idledale. Amber? Hey, you okay, kiddo? Can I ask you something? Uh-huh. Why did you take my dad's money and his watches? I, I didn't. In the bedroom. I was under the bed. Hiding. Hide & go seek. Okay. When I was your age, it drove me nuts when people talked down to me. So I'm just gonna level with you. I stole from your dad because I need money. But he's rich and I'm poor. It's like Robin Hood. You know Robin Hood? Well he's a good guy, right? He breaks the rules, but he does it for the right reason. You get it, right? Of course you get it. But your dad, he might not get it, and he might go all Sheriff of Nottingham on us. So, it's got to be our secret, okay? Can I tell you a secret? That's the only way we'll be even. There's something trying to get me. Three of them, actually. They find me in my dreams when I'm laying in bed at night. And I hear them humming like they're right inside my closet. Waiting for me. To hurt me. What do they look like? I never see them up close, but I hear them, laughing, whispering. And I keep moving towards them, but I don't want to. Okay, well we can compromise, like two grownups. I will go upstairs with you, and I'll stay until you fall asleep to make sure that you're safe. Okay? Hold on. Okay. Once upon a time there was a sorry. Excuse me. Once upon a time there was a boy in a lighthouse. Every day he stared out at the sea, watching ships go by. Each one off to a new adventure and a new exotic part of the world. At night the boy dreamt of the furthest the reaches of the globe, but in the morning the boy awoke in the lighthouse. One stormy day a ship rolled by. He couldn't take it anymore. He had to know what the world outside the lighthouse was like. He jumped into the water and he swam as hard as he could, but the tide was high and the waves were strong. He soon grew tired. He could see the ship passing by, but he couldn't swim fast enough to reach it. And soon it was gone. Vanishing over the horizon. He turned back to his home, but he was too tired to swim anymore. His arms and his legs burned and he felt himself sinking below the waves. He sank farther and farther still until his feet touched the floor of the ocean. It was there that he remembered how cozy it was in the lighthouse. He suddenly felt foolish, and he opened his mouth to laugh. But just as it opened... Hello? Wait. It worked. No nightmares. You have to stay. You're fine, okay? Go back to sleep. I won't tell my dad about Robin Hood. Okay. I'm gonna leave you here alone because that's what you need. There is nothing to be afraid of. You lost your mother, but you survived. You gotta be strong, kid. You gotta be brave. Okay? Okay. Okay, go to bed. Sorry, I'm sorry. Ow, what the hell? Sorry, Ronnie. Oh my God you kicked me in the arm! It was an honest mistake, Ronnie. It hurts! I need a doctor! I need a doctor, Kevin! Kevin, you saw! She kicked me right in the arm! Okay. Kevin, close your eyes, okay? You're gonna be in so much trouble. She's gonna... How's that arm? Arm. Good. It's good. Good. Sleep well, boys. What happened? She got totally naked. Nuh-uh. Wanna have some fun? What do you mean? Lookie what I found. Jesus, Martin? What the fuck are you doing here? That's nice. Very civil. Who's house is this? How did you even know I was here? I called Rod. And lower your voice, please. Rod did not tell you where I was. Well, the girl he's doing told me, and she also told me something else. Lindsey. God, that bitch. She told me what you're doing here. Yeah. Goddammit, come on. Go. I'm an accomplice just by being here, you know that? Oh my God. That's what I'm risking to tell you that you're my girlfriend, and... No, no, I'm not. And I'm committed to helping you get out of this dark place. Okay, the guy is rich. He's insured. And it's not like we're cleaning him out. We'll just get all the electronics in the truck. Wait. I'll do it. Whoa. This is so cool. Look at that. These still have blood on them. The Three Mothers. Ow! Aw, did baby hurt himself? Shut up, Ronnie. Ronnie? Stop honking, you fucking idiot! Woo! What up, girl? Let's burgle. Why not just set off some fireworks or fuck it let's just call the police, Rod. Look, hold up. I've been calling you. I've been texting you. What the fuck are you worried about? It's a goddamn ghost town out here anyway. Oh shit. Look out. You got your angry face on again. Look how tough you are. Come on. We about to get this money. There's my girl. You know I've got you. I've got the truck, right? Oh God. Oh my God! This is so exciting! Volume. What did I just say? Lindsey. You're here. Yeah, I mean I couldn't resist. It sounded so fun, robbing someone! Let's do this shit. What the hell are you wearing? I'm a cat burglar. It's called a sense of occasion. Cat burglars wear all black, Lindsey. Ugh, boring. Yeah and it took her ass two hours to get ready too. Look at her. Okay, can we please get serious? Yes. Your passion is seriously inspiring. Her passion? For stealing things? Oh my God. Why in the hell did you bring the ball and chain? I don't know. Ask Lindsey. Well, he said that it was an emergency and that he was your boyfriend. - He's not. - I am, I am! You're not. Awkward. Rod, can you please just take the truck around the side of the house discreetly, please. Hey look, discretion is my motherfucking jam, baby. Let's go, cute booty. Let's go. Oops! I'm gonna get you back for that. I don't even know why you hang out with them. Martin. You're a nice guy, right? Please just fuck off before I have to start getting mean, okay? You know pretty soon you're gonna realize that you messed up. Don't. And when you do, I'm gonna be there. Because that's what good boyfriends do. Get inside, get inside. Ronnie? Ronnie? Ronnie, this isn't a joke. I can do this. Ronnie. Seriously. I don't want to get in trouble. Ronnie? Hide & seek, Kevin. Let's play. Ronnie? Oh, holy shit! Look at the size of this place, baby. Come on over here. Would you shut the fuck up? I just got the kids to sleep. Ronnie? All right. So what are we doing? Why don't we take the TV down? Start with that. That little piece of shit? That TV? Are you serious? Yes, can you just do it? Please. All right, playboy. Let's do this. Come on. I'm here for her. Not this. You better control your man. I know that you're upset, baby. I know. And I'm sorry and I know that it's my fault, but if you just help out a little bit then we can all leave. And that's what you want, right? Right? That's what you want? Go. Please. Let's just get this over with. You're a fucking siren, babe. I mean he must go down on you a lot, huh? Huh. Unbelievable, Rod. Really? What? Look, it ain't about how heavy it is. Shit's mounted to the wall or something. No, you are blown halfway out of your shit. Both of you! No, no, no. We're just trying to stay focused, right babe? Most definitely. Look, my shit is laser-guided... Put it down, man. Great. What? Okay. You brought your kit, right? It's old. It's real old. Might take some digging, but you know me. I'm gonna get up in there. It doesn't matter how long it takes. He keeps it locked for a reason. No doubt. What was that? Oh God. I'll be right back you guys. All right. Well, it's time to watch daddy work. Looks like we're ahead of schedule. What? Shit, you know what. Come on. Woo! Finley? Here boy. Come on, Finley. Don't, don't. Please just don't. Let's play. Come on. Yeah, Rod! "Yeah, Rod!" Hey. Do you think she likes me? She don't like people. I know, I just, I get these weird vibes from her. Like I feel like I'm out here being friendly and she has to be all alpha. Sure. Ow, Jesus! I don't know, I just, I wish she would realize that I'm not a threat. Hey, you wanna do a line? We already finished it. Damn, for real? Yeah. I gave you a whole vial. It was a long ride over. Mm-hmm. I know yo ass. All right, one second. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Come on girl, hurry up! Hey, now you know I can hear that in there. Whoa, baby, you all right? I like you. Well I like you, too. But I also like to share. Oh! Mmmm. Ow, ow, ow, damn! What? Shit! Don't you want to play? You bit me! We could have so much fun. I'm gonna hurt you. Huh? Goddamn it. "Like valuables"? You know I hate it when you ignore me. Good relationships are built on communication. Oh, you're just not gonna talk to me now? All right. Two can play at that game. Ronnie? I am not stealing for you. Well then go the fuck home, Martin. Nobody asked you to be here, Kevin! Turn on your light, turn on your light! Go, go! Kevin! What's wrong? They killed Ronnie. Ronnie's not upstairs? Ronnie's dead. Can you look around and see if you can find him? I don't know what he looks like. There are two kids. One of them is right here. It's not exactly a needle in a fucking haystack! Just do it. Please. Kevin, tell me what happened. I tried to be brave like you said, but they're here. They're real. Not in my closet, but in my dad's office. Who is? They're witches. Three of them. I got nothing. Ronnie's dead. He's not. He's just hiding somewhere. I heard screaming. Someone else screaming. It's nothing, it's nothing. It'll be fine, okay? Can you go up and find Ronnie please? Ronnie's dead. Who are these people? Who is this kid? They are um, they're just, they're just... Can we please just fucking leave? Am I losing my mind here? This was fucked before a little kid went missing. We can't even see anything in here. There's lanterns in the pool house. Seriously, who are these people? They're just, they're helping me rob your house. What the fuck? Bush league! You don't never tell nobody that your robbing they're ass! He already knew! Hello, child. Aww. You're afraid, aren't you? Amber? Amber? It's Vincent from earlier. We bail, right? Yeah, and then they'll come after me for kidnapping. No, we need to find that little shit, Ronnie. I don't think your doorbell's working. You guys need help? Okay, okay. Lanterns. Just go. Check out the office. There's gotta be something we can flip. Yeah, you got it. I'll watch Kevin. Looks like your power's out. Amber, Amber? Don't worry child. I know you're in there. Hey. Hello again. Everything okay in here? Uhh. Yeah, no. It's nothing, we just turned the lights off. I also heard screaming. Yeah, it's just the kids. They're really rambunctious, love to scream, nothing like the Gilfords. It really looks like your power's out. I've got scented candles if you want... No, no, that's okay. Ummm, we turned the lights off, power's fine. I can call an electrician. Hey, you know what? Why don't we check out your place. I can come by for a minute. Yes! Yeah? I mean, yeah, if you want to. That's fine. Cool, okay? Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's do that. After you, after you, my lady. What's your name, child? Kevin Edward Hooper. Do you miss your friend, Kevin Edward Hooper? He wasn't my friend. Are you afraid that you're gonna get hurt like him? Maybe we could find Amber? Please. Hey, I think I know where she went, come on. I'll show you. I've been thinking about having a door put in. Yeah. I know what's going on over there by the way. What? You know that, right? Uh. You're having a little party. You and your friends in the white truck. Oh. I won't tell. Don't worry. Beer? No, no, thanks. So you, you really believe in this stuff? What? The dark arts? The occult? Sure, this satanic stuff. Before Christianity co-opted all of the most important dates on the calendar, every culture celebrated satanic or pagan ideas. You ever met Ted, next door? Just in passing. You guys would get along. I take it you don't believe in that kind of stuff? I've never seen any evidence so... I doubt you were looking. You smoke? Don't take this the wrong way, but it seems like you smoke. Ummm. What do you know about witches? But that's... You should be with your friend, Kevin Edward Hooper. He misses you. No, no! It's your turn, child. No, no! Amber! Hey! What the hell was that? You fucking idiot. You worthless piece of shit-crusted filth! You better watch your tone. How's this? So, what do you wanna know? I don't know. I mean, nothing. It's just this kid next door. He's... Well, I've written more Wikipedia than most people have read when it comes to witches. That's a really good sativa by the way, and it's almost the witching hour. The? Midnight. The witching hour. Amber, Amber, Amber help! What, what, what? Your friend! She's evil. She's not my friend. And yeah, she's the worst. No, no! She tried to kill me and she tried to lead me down to the basement and that's where they killed Ronnie. Kevin, okay, you're okay, right? I won't leave you again. You don't believe me. Have you met Vincent? He knows all about this stuff. You know you should tell him what you saw, exactly what you saw, and then he'll tell you whether it's real or definitely not real. There's witches in my house. Witches? And they all wear masks. Masks? What kind of masks? Did you copy these out of a book? No. Freehand. I saw them in my basement. These are, wait a second. No, wait. Where are you going? Check this out. That's them. The Three Mothers. You say you saw them? Not in the book. In real life? Yeah, in my basement Okay, who are The Three Mothers? Notorious child killers. Bled children dry. The lucky ones died fast. The others, they'd bleed for weeks. Legend has it that the townspeople of Salem caught them and sentenced them to death. One was burned at the stake. One hanged and one drowned. They died watching each other suffer. Kevin, how did they kill Ronnie? Describe it to me. No, no! They tied him upside down. They were whispering something to him and then they were about to cut him. Where? Cut him where? Dude, Vincent! His throat. Please. I believe him. Okay, you know what, a lot of crazy stuff has happened, right? And I can't find Ronnie. Ronnie's dead. Okay, I can't explain what's happening, but I'm sure that there's some... No! You're not sure. Please. "Get the lanterns, Martin." "Save the day, Martin." Martin. Hi. Shhh. Help! Did you not just hear that? What? Help me! Please get this crazy bitch off me! The child. Give us the child, and you won't be hurt. We've already tasted his blood. Soon we will bleed him dry. When it is our hour, we will make him suffer. Leave now or die with him. Stay right there. You're right. It'll be more fun this way. We've only just gotten started. No, no, no! No, stay right there! Amber? Get up. You're okay. My fingers! She bit my fucking fingers off! Kevin! Indomidae Brachtus Mona. You okay, little one? Was that them? Was that... Yes. What the fuck was that? An incantation. What the fuck? That bitch! Fuck! Give me back my finger, bitch! Kevin, Kevin, come on! It's jammed or something. I can't... That fucking psycho bitch! Stand back, Rod! Oh shit! Now that's clever. It looks like a rune, a spell. The house is bound to it. The doors will open on the outside but not the inside. So what we're trapped in here now? Oh not just us. Them too. Until someone opens the door from the outside, no one is going anywhere. And who the fuck are you? I'm Vincent. I live next door. He knows about this stuff. What stuff? Does anyone's phone work? We can call the cops. And what are we gonna tell them? That we're in the middle of robbing a house? Who gives a shit? They'll open the door. Kitchen. Hello? Martin. Who is this? Martin. No, who the fuck is this? Martin. Fuck you! Have you seen them before? I think so. But you've seen them, right? Landline is fucked. Does anyone have service? Master bathroom. It's the only room with service. They won't let you call for help. Shut up! What is with you, man? I mean, who are you anyway? I'm an expert on witches. An expert, okay? Who the fuck are you? Okay, okay, okay. Enough. Just got make the call, okay? You've seen them? I think so. And in your dreams they never get you, right? No. So why not? How do you stay away? Maybe, maybe we can use it. My mom always shows up. Right when they're about to get me. She tells me to run and don't look back. I run and I run, and I never never look back. And then I wake up. You smell nice. Guys, I'd love to see that book now. 9-1-1. What is your emergency? Hello? Yes! Yes, thank you, thank you. My girlfriend's friend, he's been hurt. He's bleeding. Send paramedics, fire trucks, police, just send everyone! Okay, I'm sending the request to dispatch now. Try to apply first aid and in the meantime keep the wounded area elevated. Great. Thank you. Thank you so much. What about the child? How long do think you think before you... Bring the child down to the basement. Bring the child down to the basement. What? Bring the child down to the basement. Bring the child down to the basement. Now this is incredible. Absolutely incredible. So this incantation, it hurts them, right? Not in the slightest. But it does block their spells, which seems to really piss them off. And you're sure that it's gonna work? Yeah, you just saw me use it. Plus, look, it's here in the book, too. It's witchcraft. They're witches. They gotta play by the rules. That's what they did to Ronnie. That's not gonna happen to you, okay? We're not gonna let that happen. What if we just just hide, wait for Ted to get home, and for him to open the door? Maybe. But that girl said something about an hour nearing, "our hour". The witching hour. Midnight. If they have a ritual that involves Kevin, that's when it will begin. So we've got... I take it calling the cops didn't work? No! Asshole. Oh fuck! Fuck! Fuck you! I'd like to see you try that shit again! Hey! You're the expert, right? Then why in the hell is she still fucking with me? That's witches for you. They tend to play with their food. Or, in this case, use their food to play with their food. Okay, okay. So what about the book? It's very interesting. It's a testament to the Mothers, written by their followers after their death. Their ashes were collected and turned into ink, the ink used in the book, They're not just in the book. They are the book. Or so the legend goes. Okay, so how do we stop them? No, nothing yet. Wait, hold up. Why in the hell would they tell us how to stop them? I mean you just said that the book was written by their followers, right? Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay, so, so we learn the incantation, we hide out and just hope for the best. What incantation? Indomidae Brachtus Mona. Repeat it. Indominame Brachtus... No, no. Listen, listen. Indomidae Brachtus Mona. All right, together. This is a joke. Indomidae Brachtose... No, no, no, both wrong. How do you spell it? Indomidae Brachtus Mona... Why are we even listening to this guy? Don't you live in a garage? - Jesus. - Holy shit, the garage You use a button to get into the garage, and the door slides up, right? That's how you get in and out. Yeah, I live in a garage. Get over it. No, no, think about it. We get to the garage. We raise the door. I mean the spell, it turns doors into walls so if we can get the door to slide up, no walls! Hell yeah. I mean, right? It could work. Let's do it. Okay, okay. This will be easy. You just gotta be fast, really fast. To outrun witches, because witches are real. Oh God. Figures. You said you wouldn't leave me again. Someone's gotta go. I'll go. You'll go? Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to? No, no, I don't. I'm good. Do you guys have dibs? Mm-mm, mm-mm. No, nope. Okay. Well sweet. Then yeah, I'll go. I'm really the only one qualified. I can protect myself. Right. 'Cause you know all the fancy words and stuff. Shut up. Thank you, Vincent. Uh, ummm, sorry, uh, so you're gonna run all the way down and unlock the door and then continue to run all the way back up here without having a heart attack? We need someone fast, someone athletic, someone healthy. Indomidae Brachtus Mona. Indomidae Brachtus Mona. Okay, you can't just keep saying it. Fuck off. It's like punching someone. You get a nice punch in at the start, then you'll get tired. I forgot. You're the expert and the hero. There's an innocent girl and a little kid up there. It's our responsibility to... We keep moving. Don't look back. That's it, right? It doesn't work. Let's just go. This is organized just like my garage. There's a breaker in there. You do it. I'll hit the button as soon as we're good. Go. Martin. Did you hear that? Behind you! No, no, wait, wait, wait. Indomidae, Indomidae, no! Please, no, no! Where's Vincent? What happened? He fucked up, okay! There's no power down there! He almost got me killed! Oh God! There's another garage in the pool house. Finley? Come on, Kevin! Come on, come on, go! You okay, you okay? There's something wrong with Finley. Martin? Amber! Behind you! Bitch! Amber! Amber, please! Kevin, no! Kevin, no! Amber! Fucking bitch! How you like that shit, huh? Baby? Baby, why are you hurting me? Lindsey? Fight it, Lindsey! No! Don't do it! No, no, no! No, please, no! Hello? Amber, we're home. Oh, what the fuck? Ronnie? Ronnie? Ronnie? We have to call the police. It's in the kitchen. Knock yourself out. 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Oh, thank God! My son is missing and the house has been robbed! We just went to dinner. We left the kids with Amber, with the Gilfords, and there's blood! Just slow down, ma'am, all right? So there's a boy missing? Yes! My son is missing! Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to calm down. Are you sure your boy didn't deserve it? Actions have consequences. What? I... Do you want to see your son again? Yes, I wanna see my son again! Oh my... Ronnie? Baby? Ronnie? Ronnie, Ronnie, are you here? Help me, Mommy! Are you in here? Mommy, they're hurting me. Ronnie, where are you? I hear you, baby. Don't worry, Mommy, you'll find me. Ronnie? You'll find me. It worked. Hey man, call the cops! Fuck. Rod? Rod? No, no, no! No, no, no! What the fuck, Ted? He, he came out of nowhere, and I, I and who the fuck is this guy anyway? It was self defense! He needed help. We need, I need help, Ted! Ronnie went in the office, right? It's happening. It's a paranormal event. Don't you see? You wanted this to happen? The Three Mothers target children. I needed a kid. That's all. To see what would happen. And Ronnie well, he's predictable. Kevin! Kevin found the book. No, that's, the odds of that happening are so low. You are a sick fuck, you know that? He was supposed to stay in his room. He's always in his room. I can barely get him to come down for dinner. How was I supposed to know? I'd never hurt him. I'm his father. No, you're not. What time is it? Are you done? We only have 15 minutes until midnight. Their ritual, of course. Where's the book? It's not in my office. Martin took it downstairs. Martin? Nevermind, that's fine. It'll be even better. Better? The footage. We'll go right into the lion's den. It'll be way more interesting this way. Look. Legend has it that the book was printed in the ashes of The Mothers. They're not just... In the book, they are the book. So what? Destroy the book, destroy the Mothers. That was my plan all along. I never expected anyone to you know, die, except for Ronnie. Yeah, so how do we destroy the book? The same way you destroy a witch, you burn it. Are you sure? We can't use more bullets? There's nothing else? No, we don't even know if a bullet will hurt them. But burning a book will hurt them? This isn't cops and robbers, okay sweetie? This is a paranormal event, and I am a paranormal investigator. I'm the expert here. So either you trust me, or you wing it and hope for the best. Badass. This is once-in-a-lifetime footage. Ted Hooper, Paranormal Investigator. This is it. What evil lurks in the basement of my own home? We find out... Tonight. Oh fuck, fuck! Shhh. Now watch this. Nothing's happening. Why is nothing happening? Oh God! Kevin! Okay, okay, okay! Okay, come on! Stop, stop, look at me. Okay, we're gonna run and we're not gonna look back, okay? Okay, come on. Indomidae Brachtus Mona! Indomidae Brachtus Mona! Amber! Amber! Please! Don't look back, Kevin! You. Yeah. You have any family nearby? Anyone you can stay with? Right. Damn kids. Partying at all hours of the night. God damn, can't get a night's sleep around here. What the hell's going on in there?
