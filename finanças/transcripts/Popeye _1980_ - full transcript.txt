Huh. Don't make 'em like they used to. Oh, come on. [MUTTERING] Oh! [WOMAN] I'm sorry, Mother, but it's ugly. I ask you, have you ever seen anything so ugly? I won't be engaged in this hat. I heard that. Don't think I didn't hear that. She owes me an apology. Oh... ugly. There's nothing left to say. What do you think? I think it's up to you, dear. What do you think? Ugly. I think it's a conspiracy. [SIGHS] Oh... Why would they manufacture deliberate ugliness unless they wanted me to look ugly? We find that out, we find out everything. There's a stranger in... Um... Ooh. I can't get engaged. You'll have to tell Bluto. I can't. We'll have to cancel the party tomorrow night. Not my fault that it's so ugly. [GASPS] What are you doing listening in on a private conversation between me and my mother? I have a good mind to have my father call a policeman. Olive, will you show Mr... Mr... Oh. Popeye, ma'am. - Mr. Eye the spare room? - Just Popeye. Go upstairs, Mr. Eye. Olive will show you the room. Thanks. Heh-heh. Oh, stumbled on some sort of asylum here. Show me a room. Show me some courtesy. Might be nice. [OLIVE] I don't see why I have to do anything on the day before my engagement party when nothing's ready, especially me. And what kind of name is that, anyway, Popeye? Pretty strange. What kind of name is Olive Oyl? Sounds like some kind of lubricants. - Thank you very much, ma'am. - [GASPS] Don't look in that room. That's my room. Meant no disrespect. Ugly, huh? You owe me an apology. What? Wonder who shoved a feather in his ear. What'd you say? Sure is nice weather you have here. [CHUCKLES] - Your name really Olives? - So what? Olives Oyl? [CHUCKLES] You don't look Greek. So? You're short. Or are you just passing yourself off as short? Can I see me room now? Oh, as if I cared. Let me give you a hand there. Maybe it needs a little oil. No... Oh! [YELPING] [GLASS SHATTERS] Nice-lookin' room. [SIGHS] Never seen a room done in early demoliskin before, but this'll do for me. - [CHUCKLES] - Careful how you treat that bed. Nothing goes on this bed. - Sorry, ma'am. I was just... - Watch that lamp. Let me give you some assistance here. Give me your hand. There, that's it. Yeah, here we are. Oh, you're on fire. You know that? Boy, is it hot in here. - I still respecks you. - Oh! [POPEYE MUTTERING] Me bad eye. I didn't see nothin'. Hmph. [GLASS SHATTERS] [DOOR SLAMS] Thanks for your help. Miss Oyl. Maybe... - [BELL CLANGING] - [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [WOMAN] Don't forget to put the cat out, dear. [MAN] We don't have a cat. "Eau de toilette." Yeah, eau de toilette. [CHUCKLES] [SNIFFS] Yeah. [MR. OYL] How do you like that? Gold's up 20 cents. $2.00 an ounce. [MAN] I knew it. I knew it. I could've made a fortune on fillings if Bluto would've let me go directly to the Commodore. He's so jealous of me, that Bluto. Well, who wouldn't be? [MR. OYL] Me. I'm not jealous of Castor. He's my son. Man jealous of his own son? You owe me an apology. I didn't mean you. Never lets me go to the Commodore. Commodore is a paragon of sagacity. - If ever I could put in a good word... - "Shut up" is the word. "Pass" is another word. That Wimpy, he don't pass. He should be killed to death. [MR. OYL] Says here the Commodore's taxing salt again. Mm. I don't look as good as I smell. Too late now. Huh, gotta go. - Oh, Mr. Eye... - Popeye, ma'am. Have you met... Uh, Pop... Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor, Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole. - We're all one big happy family here. - [OLIVE] Hmph. Although not really. I mean, um, well, Mr. Geezil and Mr. Wimpy are... - Me, I'm family. - Well, you're my husband. You owe me an apology. [CHUCKLES] - [OLIVE] I can't find anything. - What are you looking for? - A glass. - Oh. Here's a glass. That's a short, fat, ugly glass. I want a tall, pretty, slender glass. They're all broken. [CASTOR] I could've made a fortune in fish futures. Fish? Fish futures smell. [MEN LAUGHING] What kind of glass do you want, Olive? A wine glass or a brandy glass or a water glass? Oh, not a thing. I don't want a thing. - [POPEYE] Real appetizing. - I want a fork. Right beside your plate. If it was a knife, it would cut you. Will you sit down, Mr. Eye, please? [MR. OYL] You owe me an apology. [GEEZIL MUTTERING] - [GEEZIL] Passing fish, please. - Fish. Excellent idea, Miss Oyl. I would suggest before matrimony, fish. Fish before matrimony. That does look good there. Wish I had a plate, though. Four times engaged is three times much. [OLIVE] He can't talk me out of anything. I'm not a child. - [CASTOR] I'll say you're not a child. - Who says I'm not a child? You said you're not a child, and I agreed with you. [OLIVE] Who asked you to agree with me? No one can stop me from agreeing with you if I want to. - I can. - [MR. OYL] Quarreling at my table. You both owe me an apology. - Sorry, Pop. - What? Please pass the shrimp, chicken and meatballs. Well, I don't know. Captain Bluto has the patience of Jobe. Or is it Job? He's certainly got a very good job... Jobe... And he needs a lot of patience. Why, he runs this town for the Commodore while he's away, and the Commodore's always away. As a matter of fact, I've never seen him. Have you, Cole? - Huh? - I'd never let a girl break my engagement. I'd break her nose before she broke my engagement. And you better not try on me what you pulled on Bluto, because I'm no pushover. [COLE] You owe your sister an apology. - Will you stop fidgeting? - [POPEYE MUTTERS] [OLIVE] This knife won't cut. Here, take mine. Not since I was a child have we had a sharp knife in this house. [COLE] You owe me an apology. You don't like our knives? Bluto's rich. He can buy you plenty of knives. Oh. I hate this table. It's ugly. I'm the only one with nerve enough to tell the truth about it. [IMITATES OLIVE] Why don't you let Bluto the pushover buy you a new table? - [NORMAL VOICE] Am I right, Pop? - [COLE] Right. - I'm right, right? - You're right. [WIMPY] Nothing left? Oh, Bluto, Bluto, Bluto. Everyone takes advantage of my poor Bluto. Get a new glass, a new knife. Now they want a table. Well, hmph. That's why I always have to break off our engagement... to stop you all from taking advantage of the sweetest, most humble man on earth. - Hmph. - Hmm. [OLIVE] You make me sick. Never good to be too full, I guess. - [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] - [FAINT CHATTER, LAUGHTER] [SNARLING] [SNARLING CONTINUES] [SHOUTING] It's 9:00! Curfew! [PIANO MUSIC, CHATTERING STOP] Lights out!

[TAXMAN] Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Oyl. Didn't recognize you from the back. It won't happen again. How come Miss Oyl don't have to pay no taxes? [TAXMAN] That's ten cents question tax. - I'll give you somethin' to tax. - But I'll let you off this time. Since you're with Miss Oyl. Good night, Miss Oyl. How come bein' with Miss Oyl means you don't have to pay no taxes? Well, I don't know what you're talkin' about. [GROWLING] Here's a nice cup of tea for you, Captain Bluto, while you're waiting. [BLUTO] Where's Olive? Olive? You think everyone pays taxes but me and my family, don't you? Hmm. - Well, you couldn't be more wrong. - If I'm wrong, why am I on your right? You think because I'm engaged to Bluto and Bluto runs the town for the Commodore, we get special favors. Well, it's a lie. - Olive! - [BLUTO CONTINUES GROWLING] Bluto is kind and generous and likes to do things for his loved ones. - And you want me to hurt his feelings. - [PELICAN SQUAWKS] - Well, phooey on you. - [MUTTERS] Hmm. You don't even care enough about me or my family to be at my engagement party. And what are you doing here in Sweethaven, anyway? Hmm? Well, um, I'm lookin' for me pap. Yeah. Well, if that's true, then where is he? Well, uh, got me there. I don't really know. I, uh... I got this sensk that he's here, though, you know? Well, all right, I'll wait. Hmph! Anyway, there are too many guests as it is. Half of them I hate. [GROWLING CONTINUES] [GLASS CRUNCHING] - [GRUNTS, GROWLS] - [CRUNCHING CONTINUES] One thing I remember about me pap, he always used to throw me up in the air. But he'd never be there when I'd come down, you know. [CHUCKLES] Boy, he had a sensk of humor, didn't he? Yeah, that was me pap. I remember that time he gave me a 'lectric eel as a toy. [CHUCKLES] Eep. Yeah, that was fun. Or he'd rock me in my cradle real, real, real hard, and I'd lose me formula. Then he'd say, "One day, you'll be a sailor." I guess that's... that's what I am today. [CHUCKLES, SIGHS] Sometimes he'd bounce me on his knee. [CHUCKLES] Most of the time, he'd miss, though. Couldn't see too well with one eye. [CHUCKLES] Oh, me pap. Yeah. Well, I'm not waiting any longer. Hmm. Oh. Sorry, Miss Oyl. Here we... - [CHUCKLES] I was philostiphising. - Mm-hmm. Me train of thought kinda derailed and... [CHUCKLES] Oh, yeah. All that time waitin'. - [CHUCKLES] I could wait a while. - What are you doing with that basket? Well, I'm... I'm carryin' it. It's your basket, ain't it? It is not my basket. Somebody has deliberately painted that basket to look like my basket. My basket was clean and beautiful, and this basket's ugly. - [RATTLES] - Yikes! Rattlesnake! We should at least have dinner first or somethin'. - Rattlesnake! - I know how that feels. Rattlesnake? Where is it, Miss Oyl? Where is it? Where is that thing? Is it in there? Don't worry, Miss Oyl. I've handled vermins before. I'll rattle that snake so it's a pair of shoes. That's it. I'll rattle... [MUTTERING] I'll rattle him upside down. I'll shake him like "mariachis." - No. I'll get to him. Hey, hey. - Rattlesnake! Oh! - [POPEYE STAMMERING] Hey-hey-hey! - Yes! Oh! [COOING] [BOTH SIGH] Oh. [POPEYE] Blow me down. Oh. Here you go, little pup. - Here's your snake. [CHUCKLES] - [RATTLING] There you go. What do you got here? "To the one-eyed sailor." That must be me. Wait a minute. Hold on there. Watch out. I don't wanna hurt you. Hi. [CHUCKLES] I'll read this. I'll bring it right back to you. - Here we go. - [BABY CRYING] Oh, I ain't that ugly. It's all right. Oh. It's okay. ♪ I am, I am, I am ♪ I'm all right. Hey... It's okay.

[GASPS] Now, they ain't there, and I'm gonna prove it. - Now, where ain't they? - They ain't on the Commodore's boat. - That's where they ain't? - Mm-hmm.

His poppa outta work, and he wouldn't eat his spinach. The whole country in a depressigan... [GROANS] ...and he wouldn't eat his spinach. That was Coolidge...

Talkin' to your poor old father like that. You disobedient brat. You're spoiled, that's what you are. Spoiled. Children. Children. Kids. Ah, phooey. Phooey. Give 'em everything they want and what do you get in return? Nuts. Nuts. Nuts. Nothin' but heartache. Heartache, sadness, and miserky. Once in a while, you try to give them a bath and they don't want it. And another bad time when you want to do something that you really want to do, but all they want to do is not what you want to do. Bless their little hearts. If they were made out of gold, I'd like to sell 'em on the open marketplace. - I could make me a fortune. - I could have made a fortune... Kids! Ahh! They don't know what they're doin'. Kids. Dad-blast 'em. They're gonna lead you to ruin. That's what they gonna do... lead you to ruin. They cry at you when they're young, they yell at you when they're older, they borrows from you when they're middle-aged, and they leave you alone to die without even payin' you back. Children. Phooey. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] [HORN BLOWS] You give 'em everything they want, and what do you get back in return? - You get nothin'. - Caught you like a big red lobster! They're just smaller versions of us, you know. But I'm not so crazy about me in the first place. So why do I want one of them? I ask you. Children. Ah, children. Little children. You pour your heart out to 'em, give 'em everything they want, give 'em candy and a lot of toys. And what do you get back? You get a lot of noise. ♪ Nah-na-na na-na-na ♪ ♪ My papa's a mean old man ♪ [HORN BLOWS] I'm through with children. I'm through with kids. There ain't nothin' I'm never gonna do about it.

All I'm gonna do is fire a warning shot right across the bow. Don't you thinks I knows what I'm doin'? Ah! Short! Gorsh, I was a little short! - Reload it. Reload it. Reload. - [POPEYE] No, you don't. Dad-blast it, I missed! - [ALL SHOUTING] - Full speed ahead! Slow down, Pap, so we can board her. We're not gonna board her. I'm gonna ram him! I'm gonna ram him!
