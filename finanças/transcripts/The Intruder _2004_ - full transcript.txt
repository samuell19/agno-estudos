You may now smash the bottle against the side of the ship. We are happy to be here. After checking the details, we have finally decided to accept your order. Congratulations. But the investigation procedure was not easy. It seems you've led a life full of surprises and variations. We've traced you in France, Switzerland and even in Russia. But as your bank guarantees seem to be reliable, we congratulate you on this agreement. I think you are lucky to be starting a new life at your age. We envy you. It's for my son. He's sails. He loves the sea. It's my gift. I have a son, too. Your decision must have been a difficult one. So I understand you. As we've concluded this agreement, I propose a toast to the love between a father and son. - It's a bit strong. - A bit. Now, I'll pour you one. Cheers. - You have to learn Japanese. - I'll work at it. In six months, you'll be fluent. Look, a foreigner. - He's all alone. - He's far from home. He doesn't understand us. - A toast? - We're drinking too much. He looks lonely. That's good. - We'll wait at the next bar. - You know which bar. Stop hounding me. I've got a weak heart. - Go away! - It's not a weak heart. Your heart's not weak, it's just empty. "Beloved son. "Beloved son. "How I've missed you. "I was absent from your life... "...for so long. "You'll see, I'll make it up to you. "Every lost day... "...that has kept us apart... "...weighs on my heart like an entire year. "Don't push me away. "I'm on my way." Since I've had proxy, nothing has arisen. I thought I'd hear from your son, but I didn't, so this money is yours now. I'm returning... ...the bank statement... ...and the proxy, which I don't need, since the money is yours to do with as you please. What will you do now? My father told me. You owe him. I have nothing against you. But you don't belong here. Trebor, your son is our son now. He knows nothing of you. He never had a father. He's not going to start caring now. You've grown. Your father... ...a big, strong man. Where's your mum? What do you want, Louis? I've brought money for Tikki. Why doesn't he use his account? Sit down. I've thought it over. He's my son. Everything I have is his. So tell me where he is. He comes by when he feels like it. He works on the schooners. He doesn't want to see you. A glass of water? - Alice, did you see a white man? - No. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Louis... So you're back? You can't carry it all on your head. Louis, what are you doing here? I'm fixing the place up. I'd rather my son came to my house. What's that? The outlook for the Leeward Islands: Hazy sunshine and unsettled skies, with light to moderate SE winds. The sea will be fairly rough to rough, with south and southwest swells to six feet... Take a breath. When was your operation? Are you taking your medication? Sir? - Thank you. - Thank you, honey. Thank you all for coming today. Following our discussion, we are going to select one of you to be the son we're looking for. This is how we will proceed - we will call you to step up. Step up. Over there. Sit down. The aim of this meeting is to make a selection. So we're going to ask each of you to step forward and give us your name. You can step up now. - What is your name? - Antoine. Now we will all observe him and give our opinion on Antoine. He's not very tall, so he's the right size and build. But he doesn't look anything like Louis' son. - He won't do. - Thank you. What do you think of this man? He's not right. You may go. - What is your name? - Tama. - What do you think? - I don't think he'll do. Short. Yes, a bit short. - Name? - Tehari. - Your opinion? - Maybe this one. I think so, too. But we have to decide together. He looks a bit like a white man. But we all have to decide together. - What do you think? - No, he won't do. True, he does look a bit like a white man. Still, he doesn't quite correspond. - He won't do either. - You may go. - What's your name? - Steve. - Oh, no. In my opinion, not at all! - He won't do. Don't dawdle. - Your name? - The son of his father and mother. Of his father and mother! Too short. A midget's taller than him. Flo. But this one is too tall. It's not him either. No good. You may go. - What's your name? - Manu. Ah, he seems right. But a bit dark-skinned. Yes, he's too dark. He won't do. What do you think? This one's a bit too slanty-eyed. He looks Asian. We can't decide. A bit Chinese. You may go. - What's your name? - Smith. He doesn't seem right either. Too short and too fat. He won't do. Too short and too heavy. No good. There must be a suitable young man around here. We've decided to help Henri. We've decided to find a son for Louis. That's why we're not worried. Let's keep trying. What do you think? In my opinion, it's good to observe all these young men. But I also think the final decision belongs to the person behind these auditions. That's what I'm trying to do, but she's the one who can tell us if he's on the list. Is the name of Louis's son on the list? OK, let's look over the list. You never know, maybe there's someone we didn't examine properly. In my opinion, Louis' son isn't on this list. - Not a single person? - Not one! Then what the hell are you writing for, if there's no one? Hey, Henri... Come in. Hello, Henri. I came to see you. I hear you're looking for a son. I think we can do business. Come in. I'm here. If you need me, you know where to find me. - Come and see me? - OK. We'll do it that way. OK, Henri. Hello. Hello. How was your meal? I'll be back. - What's your real name? - Toni. - What? - Toni. Toni. You don't belong here with a man like me. Here. Take this. Take it. Make an effort. Don't let yourself go. You have a visitor. We'll clean you up. Let's sit up. You'll be fine. You can't be seen like this. Come on! Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go. OK, let's go now. Come on, let's pull now, pull, pull, pull. Faster! Go, go, go, go, go!
