Welcome Captain Flash Rider! Now, just need the bars, Then on to level 45. Flash power activated! Huh? Game interrupted by unknown player. Game over. Come on, mom. Play time can wait, Willy. Your father's making breakfast. Well, can I first finish this level? Make up your mind. I thought you wanted to help with the mission, so.. Uh of course I want to help Then if you want to help, go and eat your breakfast with dad and then go to the warehouse with him. Okay. Wait, you're not coming? Well, not yet. I have something urgent in the lab. Really? What is it? Can I watch? End of discussion. Hm .. Ah ... Willy. Mom, please .. Just five minutes. Okay, you win. But don't touch anything on your father's desk. Huh? Heh .. Yeah, especially that. Uh.. mom? Don't worry Willy. Here, watch. Thanks mom. By the way, there's a little side effect. But you're in luck, I just made a dose of the antidote. What for? I'm feeling just fine. Here, drink this. 'Morning dad. How's it going? Hi Willy, I'm great. But things are.. a bit hairy! Yeah, that sounds like another dad joke. Here, mom made this for you. Oh, thanks buddy. Ah, that's more like it. You know Willy, this is the last day of our expedition. So tonight we begin our voyage back to earth. Of course I know, I can't wait. I'm gonna see my friends again. One dino pancake, for Captain Flash Rider. Um, thanks dad. I'm off, join me when you're done? Mm .. Can I count on you to help him with the mission? Mm.. Wow, that's cool. Is that what I'm doing? Taking pictures of creatures? Yes, one day perhaps. But for now, you'll have to learn the basics. To be a good explorer, you have to document each one of your discoveries. Yes, I know that dad, but what's the mission? You have to take pictures of the samples we brought back from the planet yesterday Here, now you try. Mm.. Huh? Like that? That's perfect. Soon, you will be a real explorer. Well, it's not that complicated. I'll leave you to it. I'll help mom prepare for the voyage home. Once you're done with the last box, the mission will be over. Ok, got it. One box, won't take very long. Uh.. I'll be here forever. So, did you finish plotting our course? Almost done. Uh, did you leave Willy alone in the warehouse? Relax, he's 10, I think we can trust him by now An asteroid field! I'm goin' to get Willy, wait here. Willy! Willy? Oh, where'd he go? Willy! What's happening? Wait, Willy's not with you? No, he wasn't in the warehouse. I'll find him. Willy? Willy are you there? Willy! Huh? Oh, Willy. I'm scared dad, what's going on? It'll be ok, son. Come join us on the bridge. I'm coming. The shield just gave out! Security protocol has been activated! NO! Open the door! There's nothing we can do Willy, it's locked, I'm sorry. Get in the pod, you'll be safe in there. Ejection sequence initiated. Oh no! Come back! No! Huh? Willy! Mom? Willy are you ok? Yeah, I'm ok. Are you coming for me? Listen to me, son, we might be seperated for a little while, but you don't need to worry. Your mom and I will take care of everything, we'll find you. Follow the instructions until then. What? - Follow .. .. - But Dad! Understand? But .. Where .. Where I am? Uh .. Hello? Subject: male. Age: 10. First name: William. Hello Mr. William. I am your personal survival module for cases of emergency landing on an unknown planet. Unit B.U.C.K. 0813. But you can call me Buck. Do you have any questions Mr William? Uh.. Sure. Where are we? On an unknown planet. Atmospheric analysis - ok. Oxygen detected. - Unlocking hatch. - Huh? Wait, what are you doing? Please remain in the pod, while I inspect the terrain. Why don't we take off now? I have to find my parents. Impossible maneuver. This emergency pod was designed for landing, not taking off. But.. How'm I gonna find them? They will find you. When a space traveller disappears, Dozens of search probes are launched to initiate a rescue. This transmitter broadcasts a continuous distress signal. When a probe is in proximity to this planet it'll pick up the signal, transmit it to a near by ship and a rescue will be launched. So we just wait for a probe to fly by and I'll find my parents, right? Absolutely Mr. William. And when do we get this probe? No idea. Huh ... But do not worry, the pod contains everything necessary for survival. Broccoli pure. Broccoli pure. Human behavior database - Mouth corners turned down, and occular humidity indicates a degraded emotional state. Recommendation - entertain the subject. Discovery kit. Unknown planet edition. Huh? Wow, check it out! Uh, what? Huh? Hah Uh-huh Alright! Uh Ah Oww Whoah! Entertainment successful. Emotional state improved, mission accomplished. New battery for unit B.U.C.K. 0813. Fully charged. Perfect. Ahah! What are you doing, Mr. William? Just.. playing a joke. I am sorry, Mr. William, I do not understand. However, if it improves your emotional state, please go on. I shall continue to follow this little dot for as long as you want me to. Huh? Whatever. Cool, Choco Crunches. Umm. Human behaviour database - mouth corners turned up express contentment. Like that? That's perfect. Soon, you will be a real explorer. Great. I'm the first human to explore this planet and there're only rocks to photograph. Oh well, you gotta start somewhere. Local weather conditions require consistent hydration. Here, Mr. William. Not now Buck. I still need this whole side. It is very strange. I did not pick up any seismic activity in this area. Uh, that doesn't look like an earthquake. Remain calm Mr. William. Sometimes the biggest creatures are not always the dangerous ones. Sometimes they are. Run! Priority number one, retrieve transmitter. Without it, we will never be found. Wow, cool! Priority number two, retrieve battery pack. Estimated time of collision with hostile, 18 seconds. Recommendation, high speed motion. Can you hold on to this while I transport us out of harms way? - Ok! Climb aboard, Mr. William Uh, but I never learned to ride a bike. Do not worry, I will do the driving. Uh, ok. Oh no. Ahh! Buck, I dropped the battery back there. Adverse conditions for retrieval attempt. Hey Buck, we'll never fit! Indeed Mr. William, we will not. Unless you lower your head 13 centimetres. Huh? Perfect. We are out of range of those creatures. You may now get off, Mr. William. Huh? We made it? We're alive? Thankyou Buck. Give me five. Entry, the phrase, to give five identified in Earth customs register. Five. Uhh .. Oww, oww, uhh, uhh. Eeh .. Oww, oww. Ooh ooh. But Buck, the pod was destroyed. How are we supposed to send the signal? Do not worry Mr. William. I can power the transmitter myself. You're actually not too bad for a robot. The grapnel, and the bike, that was so.. Wait for me here, I will check that it is perfectly safe. You can come out, Mr. William. Wow. In the forest we should find enough sustenance to replace the rations we lost in the desert. Tomorrow we shall go there to set up camp. Until a probe finds us. A probe.. Hey Buck, isn't that a probe? No, Mr. William. And that's a probe, isn't it? No. And that? No. - Are you sure? - Yes. - And that? - Still no. - That one, it's a probe, right? - No. - And there? - No. - There? - No. - There.. - No. And.. there? Mr. William's safety Ok. Signal strength, ok. Battery level, 72%. Ok. Wow, cool! My first photo of a creature. Buck what's the deal? Why'd you do that? I could not run the risk of this creature attacking you. Huh? What are you talking about? What could that thing do to me? That is exactly the problem. I could not be certain. My mission is to see that you remain safe and sound. Let us go. We must reach the forest before nightfall. Hey, remember. I have a mission as well. I'm an explorer, and I have to take pictures of everything I find. Ah.. Hey Buck, wait for me. No danger in proximity. Abundance of clean water. This place seems ideal to set up our base camp. Heh? I am off to survey the perimeter and make sure there is no danger. Please remain here. Do not move and do not touch anything. Huh? You're not going to leave me by myself? Here. You will feel much better. Thanks, but.. Buck, wait! Do not worry Mr. William. I will be back. Huh? Hey! Hello. Don't be afraid. You're not afraid of them, are you? Go away, shoo! I'll protect you, okay? Uh .. Uhh .. Easy now you big ugly creature. Easy.. Oh, you're hungry, is that it? Look, some good chocolate crunch. Hmm. They're so delicious.. Huh? Hah? What? Mr. William, you were to wait for me in the clearing without moving or touching anything. Ah, not a good time to talk about that. Indeed. Uh, what are you ... New entry - Shocks and falls incite amusement in subject. Ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha You should be more careful, Mr. William. It wasn't my fault. You should never wander. Even for hunting. But I must admit, this is a nice catch. It is absolutely edible. 'Scuse me? Are you nuts? We're not gonna eat him. It's err.. My faithful companion, Flash Rider. But you can call him Flash if you prefer. If you're not going to eat it, this creature is useless to us. Correct, Mr. Flash? Stop. What are you doing? But he looked so friendly Buck. Indeed, Mr. William. That creature did not appear to be dangerous. Let us hurry, we have to find a safe place for the night. Hmm. What a boring day. I didn't even get a single creature. A probe will come eventually, right? Huh? Um. Ahh, missed another one. I'm sick of this. Uh. Huh? Wow. Amazing! There's a whole family here. Thanks Buck. You are welcome, Mr. William. Mr. William's safety, okay. Signal strength, okay. Battery level, 50%. Recommendation, temporary sleep mode. Hurry up. We must find a place to set up our base camp. I know Buck, but I'm super hungry. Woah. Ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha Ha ha Huh? What is that? Huh? Poor thing. We can't just leave him like that. Remain completely still. Wow. That alarm system is cool. I'm sure even my parents never saw something like that. Oh, I didn't even take a photo. Ugh, I'm still hungry. Analysis, okay. No toxic substance detected. Hm? Bahg It burns.. Analysis okay. Analysis okay. Analysis okay. Ah, are you really sure this time Buck? Absolutely, Mr. William. No risk of side effects. This planet's vegetation is full of surprises. In addition, it's contents seem extremely sticky. Huh? Okay, I'll help you. Mr. William? Everything alright? Mr. William? Are you there? Interesting. The plant's content dries very quickly, then becomes quite brittle. This place will be perfect for our base camp. Flash? I'm so happy to see you again. Yum, that looks so good. Thank you. Um. Umm. Don't worry, I'll talk to him. Buck! Stop. Stop. What do you have against him anyway? I already informed you of the uselessness of this creature. What? You really don't get it, do you? I finally meet a friend, and you chase him away. Thanks. You are welcome, Mr. William. Human psychology database - Displays of affection miay improve the subjects emotional state. Is everything all right, Mr. William? No, not really. We've been on this planet for several days now, and there's still no news from my parents. Are you sure that probe will come by? Yes, soon Mr. William. Soon. Flash. Shh. It's okay, he's not around. Fetch! Quick Flash, go hide. Careful, Mr. William. Dead branches are falling from the trees. Oh, yeah? Kinda weird, huh? Come on, let us go back. We have to get to the camp to build a hut. Well, I don't see the point since you said we're leaving soon. Mr. William, soon could mean several weeks, you realise. Don't you think you're exagerrating? Uh, gotta go. I really need to ... you know. I will come with you, Mr. William. Uh, no thanks, I think I can manage on my own. And it might actually take a while. I feel it's gonna be a big one. But don't worry, I'll call you if there's a problem. Have a good poop, Mr. William. I won't miss it this time. Oh no, what did I do? I'm really sorry. Wait, I'll try and fix it. I'm just trying to help you Don't worry. Hmm. Come on. Stop. Let me do it. You'll see. Now hold still. There you go. It worked, Flash. Okay, not too long though, or Buck will be suspicious. Mr. William, Mr. William, are you there? Mr. William? Mr. William, are you there? Mr. William? Mr. William? Wow. Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yi haa! Wow Flash, that was awesome. Huh? You lied to me, Mr. William. I have been looking all over for you. I'm sorry. We just wanted to have some fun. Besides, nothing bad happened. In order to protect you efficiently, I must know where you are at all times. Yeah, I know. Come along. Ouch, it stings. Flash? Huh? Buck! Buck, what's happening to me? Subject contaminated by unknown substance. Vitals declining. What happened to you? Plant Category 4 caliber 9. Maximum danger. Recommendation: search for antidote. Antidote not identified. Antidote not identified. Antidote not identified. Heart rate: dropping. Subjects chance of survival: compromised. Willy? Willy? - Willy. - Willy. Dad? Mom? We're here my love. I made progress in my mission, look. Great job, you're a real explorer. When are you guys coming to get me? We don't know yet. You're big enough to make it without us now. Huh? No, don't leave me, please. No! Please! Protection mission failure. Protection mission failure. Flash? Mr William's safety, okay. You will feel better in no time. Let us go. Perhaps Mr. Flash can come join us. What? Really? Flash, you can come with us. I slept so well. Come on Flash, we ... Huh? Flash? Buck, Buck, come quick. There's something wrong with Flash. Do not worry. Your friend Flash is just going through a metamorphosis. And he is in a state of hatching. Awesome. Not so awesome. Flash, you okay? Woah! Woah. Ah Ha ha ha Say "cheese ". Oh no Flash. I can't wait to show mom and dad what we've made. I wish they were here with us. They would be very proud of you, Mr. William. Give me 5. Huh? Hehehe. Come on, let's eat. Oh. You could've left me a little bit. Okay, I'll go get some more. Flash? Did you just make a joke, Buck? I believe so, Mr. William. Hehehe. Yeah, you made a joke. Did you see that Flash? Buck made a joke. Yuck, that's gross. Let us find shelter. Come on Flash. Don't worry, it's only thunder, you're safe. What a chicken. Hail is coming down. Maybe we better go find Flash. Excellent idea, Mr. William. Woah. Huh? Wow, great shield protector. Thanks Buck. What would I ever do without you? Alert! Battery level low. Huh? Wow, that was quite a hail storm. Hey Flash. Alright. You okay? What about you Buck? Are you okay? Yes Mr. William, everything is okay. But I am going to have to leave you for a while. What? Oh, you're making another joke, right? Not at all. Activating the shield nearly depleted my battery reserve. I have to switch to power saving mode. And what does that mean? I shall enter total sleep mode and prioritize the transmitter. Oh but, you can't just turn yourself off like that. I am sorry, it is the best option. No! You can't do that, I need you. You will manage very well without me. In any case, I will power back on when a probe is detected. In the meantime, rely on Mr. Flash. He knows this planet quite well. He will help you achieve your mission. You may have to be patient, but whatever happens, be careful. Goodbye for now, Mr. William. I need you Buck, don't go away. Don't worry, I won't let you down, okay. You're gonna be safe in here. Alright, I found one. You'll see Buck, we'll wake you up. This is what we need to get. Ready? What's the matter? Rock monsters? That's what's scaring you? Don't worry, if we're quiet, they won't see us. C'mon. Let's go. Stop, let me go, I have to. We can't leave Buck like this. Just wait me here. I'll go alone. Flash? Hey Flash, be careful. Not so fast. Run, Flash. Flash? Flash. I'm so sorry I put you in so much danger. I don't want to lose you too. Don't you worry, I'll take care of you. Whatever you do, don't move. Huh? I'm okay Flash, I'll be right with you. Anyone! Help me! Please! Help me! Help me! Anyone? I'll nevermake it out of here. I'll never see my parents again. Huh? Okay now, don't move. This time it has to work. You okay, Flash? Thank you, you saved my life. Hang in there Flash, we'll be home soon. You're right Buck. I can't just do whatever I want. The most important thing is that you keep sending the signal. So we get rescued. Together with Flash, I'll keep exploring the planet. You'll see, I'll protect you and you'll protect me. Together, nothing can bring us down. Mom, dad, I'll wait for you, as long as I have to. TEN MONTHS LATER I'm gonna catch you Flash. You're sucked! Alright, we're here. But Flash, We've been working on this plan for weeks. You can't just eat all the bait. It comes through here every day. With all this bait, it should show up soon. Stop making noise, or it's gonna zero in on us again. We've missed it at least 50 times. What? Already? Oh no. Come on, it's okay. You chase him over to the urchins. I'll go this way, it's a shortcut. Huh? Oh! You're welcome. Uhh. Yeah, well done Flash. Hmmm Huh? We got it? We got it? We got it! We got it Flash! We got it! We got it! We got it! Come on High 5! You're the best. You know what? We're an awesome team together. This is a really super collection. Here you go, the popcorn is ready. Let's go over to the living room. Wait. I can't believe it. Is that a ... a probe? So then ... this means someone is really coming. I'm going to see my parents. And Buck. He said he would turn back on when the probe came by. Buck is going to wake up. Come on, let's go get him. Ahh. Okay, I'll get him myself. Buck, what are you doing, come on. Wake up, a probe is flying by. Huh? It's completely empty. You can't even send a signal anymore. Go and hide until I get back. This time I can't wake them up. No gas, super. Yeah, we made it! Woah. Ugh. Flash. Flash, we have to turn around. You go find the battery, and we'll clear the way, okay? Hmm. Oh no, I'll never project that far. Time for fruit jam, my man. Huh? There's more? They'll never get off our backs. Brake! Flash, catch! Say "cheese ". Thank's for the picture. Yeah, collection complete! Hurry, let's go back to Buck. Buck. Mr. William, is that you? Well, who else? I really missed you, rust bucket. You disobeyed my orders again. Huh? You must have taken enormous risks to retrieve this new battery. Yeah, but. uh ... That is incredible! How couragous, I am so proud of you. And that big creature.. Is it ... Oh It is. It is you, Mr. Flash. The probe picked up our signal. That is it, Mr. William. You are finally going home. I'm going home. The probe is sending us a message. Greetings. This is search probe RO-0612. Your rescue request has been processed. An automatic retrieval pod will arrive in less than 24 hours. This one's really cool, I'll take it. Yeah, it should fit, and they have to taste this. We don't have these on earth. Oh and this, mom and dad will love it. Oh and ... Come on, hurry up, Mr. William. The rescue pod will be landing shortly. I'm trying to Buck. Hmm. Thank you for everything I would never be able to go home without you. Goodbye my friend. Well, what're you waiting for? Come on, don't worry. It's okay, there's enough space for the three of us. What're you doing? I don't understand. I believe it is time to say goodbye, Mr. William. Huh? What? So you're not coming? We have to go, Mr. William. Goodbye, Mr. Flash. Goodbye Flash. Oh there you are. I'll come back to see you Flash. I promise. Dad? Mom? Dad! Mom! Willy! Are you alright? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. But I have to tell you, it was unbelievable! I made a friend, his name is Flash. He helped me complete my mission, and Buck - he's an awesome robot. And the rock monsters. Flash and I beat them because we had to get a battery for Buck. And there was a beetle, I broke his horn, but I didn't mean to though... We reached earth a few days later. It was just incredible. Everybody was amazed by my collection. Of course, I think about Flash all the time, and I miss him a lot. Sometimes, I wonder why he didn't want to come with me to earth. But then I think, if I were him, I would want to stay on that planet too. It's his home, after all. His planet. I guess.. now it's kinda mine too.
