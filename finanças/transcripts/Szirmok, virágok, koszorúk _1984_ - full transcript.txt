Presented by FLOWERS OF REVERIE lstvan... lstvan! Too bad about the horse, son. Thanks the heavens colonel, that this pistol is out of bullets. Thank the heavens lieutenant, that the army doesn't exist anymore. Otherwise you would be court-martialed. Lieutenant, I can hear the cannons! Kossuth's approaching with the support groups! Kossuth... he's nowhere to be found. He's far and away. Saving his hide. Featuring: Lieutenant, life or money? Written by Cinematographer Directed by Lajos Kossuth sent word to us that he ran out of manpower; If he sends another word to us, we all need to enter the war; Long live Hungarian liberty, long live the homeland... Rain is pouring down on Lajos Kossuth's hat; As many drops pour on him, as many blessings on him; Long live Hungarian liberty, long live the homeland! As many drops pour on him, as many blessings on him; Long live Hungarian liberty, long live the homeland! Hey, musician! So how do you decide, lieutenant? There is no time. They'll hand us over to the Austrians tomorrow. There's no escaping from there. My God, grant me to forget this dishonour! My God, grant me never to forget it. Let us swear that we'll go to the frontline again once our country calls us back. Lajos Kossuth sent word to us that he ran out of manpower; If he sends another word to us, we all need to enter the war; Long live Hungarian liberty, long live the homeland... - Tauglich! - Weiter! - Tauglich! - Weiter! - Tauglich! - Weiter! - Tauglich! - Weiter! - Tauglich! - Weiter! - Tauglich! - Weiter! - Tauglich! - Weiter!

I don't understand you. I simply fail to see why did you choose him of all people as the godfather. What else could I do? Anything but this. Why? Do you have a better idea? And who'll be the godmother? You. We discussed that, didn't we? No. I won't be a godmother on uncle Heinrich's side. What were you thinking?! The wife of a parliamentary representative, a rebel, an usurper should pose besides the chief secretary of the Interior Ministry? Interesting, uncle Heinrich said the same. That wherever you act as a godmother, the godfather can be none other than your husband. And what did you reply to him? What could I have replied? He won't ever leave his little lair, especially not for my baby child! Quit yelling... If my poor dead sister would hear us now, she'd fail to understand the cause of our altercation! The child needs to be baptised. He cannot remain a pagan. So what? As if my intentions were any different. Do you think that's not what I want too? Ferenc. What do you want? We need to talk. Is that why you came? Yes. Now? What do you have a problem with, the past? We have nothing to be ashamed of. Is that what you think? Or do you have a problem with me? I can thank a police chief for my freedom. How long will you accuse me because of that? Either I come to peace with that or hang myself. Well, that makes the wait for your return worthwhile! So you hang yourself, huh? That would probably help you in the end. If only my memory would linger at home. And where would you be meanwhile?! Not here. The politician of a failed revolution should be either in prison, in exile, executed or in emigration. What do you want from me? I'm at home. If you intend to hold the baptism in your uncle's house, you shouldn't count on me. Your own children were baptised in there, if my memory serves well. Important events have occurred since then. For instance, a revolution was crushed and that was in part uncle Heinrich's doing. It would be a pity for you to skip meeting him, you'd have a chance to thank him for arranging your setting free. I didn't ask him to do it. It was our common intention. Our thinking was that it would be crucial that you came home. And now that you're here, you come up with conditions and even blackmail us... I'm not blackmailing anyone. We can't afford to be ungrateful. You know exactly that everything has a price. When they let you go, your freedom came with a price tag too. And as an adult man you understood what can you be granted in exchange of your signature. Your brother is informed very well indeed. They made me sign a declaration bidding me never to interfere with politics in the future. And that I should forget everything that is worthy of remembrance at all. You shouldn't harbor illusions! I was assigned as an Austrian soldier even against the Italian revolutionaries. That is not true. Yes, it is true. I wasn't happy to sign the German language declaration of loyalty either and I assumed the office to support my family. In the police force... Yes, since the press office is part of the Interior Ministry. We cannot allow ourselves to walk around with our heads hung in shame. But if you'd dare to ponder how you grew from a liberal journalist of the revolution to become an imperial censor, you'd have a reason to hang your head in shame. We have already lost the past, let us struggle not to lose our future. I'm fleeing anyone who mentions the past. Yet I do live in the past. And they can make me sign a hundred declarations of loyalty, I won't forget anything. My memories shield me from having to be grateful to colonel Heinrich, or as you refer to him endearingly, uncle Heinrich. A mountain of corpses divide us two. What if... What if you folks would finally concern yourself with the living? You take revenge on an innocent child. I can't see why a family couldn't gather in a chapel, putting aside differences for a while. Why are you blowing this up so much? I really can't understand it. I really cannot. Sandor, ego te baptiso in nomine Patris et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Deus omnipotens, Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, quite regenereratit ex aqua et Spiritus Sancto, quique dedit tibi remissianes omnium peccatorum, ipse te liniat Chrismate salutis in aodem Christo Jesu Domino nostro in at habeas vitam aternam. - Amen. - Amen. Pax tibim. Vadeete in pace, et Dominus sit vobiscum. Thank you very much. Come on, laugh for me a bit. Run off to play. Let's empty our glasses and wish that our little Sandor, the freshest bud on our family tree, will be granted blessing and happiness. Long live the youngest Tarnoczy! Grow mature and grow smart... Bring us joy and offer some solace in our sadness that was caused by the tragic loss of your dear mother. You have no idea how overjoyed I am to see all of you gather in my house, my dearests. Well, will you walk to your father? Go ahead. Come outside! Stop that, you shouldn't fo it! Come back here! Come, come quick, back, back! Come on, you'll catch a cold. All right. Are you satisfied with me? You'll overcome. Congratulations, an excellent choice for a godfather. I heard you're writing some book. Well yes, but I didn't accept their offer yet. But you did take the advance sum. Why don't you come to me when in dire straits? Do you really need a book like that which offers excuses for statarial procedures? It will be but a simple explanation of laws for the masses... Still, you should be more careful about throwing your name around like that. The weather turned out to be great, you see? Why don't we take a walk before lunch? - Would you hold him? - Sure, give him to me. Meanwhile, I'll have a few words with Ferenc. Hmm? Don't you wish to tell me something? Me? After all you're right, the important thing is that you came home. And thank God, your hands and legs are intact... Your family got you back in good health. Indeed, I've become an emotional old man. But I'm happy that you're back here, Ferenc. Let's not play this. We both had to endure discomfort about one another: for you the rebel relative, for me the Austrian uniform. Well, I'm not about to deny that. They make me accountable for my family, and as distressing this responsibility is, I've never tried to avoid it. You're one lucky man... uncle Heinrich. You're only accountable to your higher-ups. You think so? Hm. And you're only accountable to your conscience, am I right? Well, yes. Let me give you something to read. What's that? The log of your speeches in the Parliament. This is what they label forbidden literature. Radical reform thoughts against which I used to fight adamantly. Just read them, it's worth the time. You can get to know the real Ferenc Majlath. Sane economical arguments lacking hollow moralisation: that is exactly what we need now. Who does? Write down everything just the way you believe, without self-censorship. And I give you my word that it will reach the authorities in charge. May we eat now? - Give me some too. - I'll have some of it. I wish I had the same possibilities... The best university in all Europe. They won't even acknowledge you without a correct cover letter. Well, I honestly pity you, Miklos. What for? For being sent to Vienna to study. Why are you trying to bemuse him? Back then it was you who was nudging him, saying that he needs to study, he needs to attend a university. My Maria, I was mistaken, you understand? I was mistaken. We're talking nonsense, confusing him in the end. Well, let the ones who crushed our liberty war educate him then. The fate of our future is not in the hands of politicians, but professionals. Let him find out about industry, agriculture, then he'll make up his mind about what to do about them, what shall he become. And make him promptly forget that he's Hungarian. He's not supposed to forget that, but he needs to realise that he's a citizen of an empire and can be Hungarian within that frame. If we're unable to think as parts of an imperial economy and foreign policy, we won't do our homeland any good that way. If there will be a homeland... Ferenc, these sentiments need to be soothed: the land should be nurtured with dung, not blood. If your kind wasn't so stubborn, if you people wouldn't hold on to the obsolete notion of a homeland so tightly, a constitutional order of law would be a reality. Yes, the time of sovereign monarchs is soon over, in ten years not a single emperor will grace Europe. Make sure to remember my words then. We need a Parliament, political parties, elections, an opposition! Opposition? Did I hear you right? We need one. And did you already submit these bold suggestions to the authorities in charge? Do you mean... the emperor? I do. Whose time is soon over. What's over is the time of rebellions, the time of making peace has come. And our family is one that was granted an imperial pardon... I'll have none of that. But I'll never pardon the emperor. Ferenc! Don't throw it around, it's mine. Oh, this is ruined. - Good night, mom. - Good night. Go to bed now. Gergo, Dani. Good night. Go to sleep. Good night. No more playing for the night. Good night... Good night, dad... No, I don't want to! Leave me. Kernel, leave him! Leave that kid alone. You're drunk. Lie down. Go in, help the gentleman. Come on, advisor, sir... please lie down. Close the door. Colonel, sir... Iran out of hope of ever seeing you again. We were beginners. We thought that our enthusiasm could substitute for a lack of military expertise. That with speeches, little poems, longhaired poets we could make up for a lack of ammunition, cannons, horses, all the things one needs to win battles. We were fools. And I did tell Kossuth in Turkey when I had a chance to talk to him: I masqueraded as a portrait painter in order to get close to him, since he was surrounded by bodyguards. Governor, I hereby present myself for duty once again! My willpower is just as strong as yours, it's only my talent that is lacking. Why, once a donkey, always a donkey! But whatever you can expect from a Hungarian donkey, you can expect from me too... Lieutenant. My lady... We've set a simple task for the nation to achieve: make sure they're ready on the rebellion's day. - Will that day come? - There is one. There is, lieutenant. The invisible government has already set a day for the rebellion and the nation is ready to conjure the spirit of '48. A single date will do and the people shall leave their lairs. The movement is still invisible at this time. The crucial thing is that they believe in it and whoever fails to believe should be forced with violence or else betrayal will reign free and we'll not move an inch! The recruiting officers of the army scout the country like I do, building the organisation from cell to cell: we divide the people to months, weeks, days, hours and minutes. Our arms come from West, 250 thousand rifles. Our holiest goal: a national rebellion. Lieutenant! I do hope that the invisible army can count on you, lieutenant. If it needs to be, we'll march to the frontlines again when our nation calls. Ahh! : p. - Speak your name. - Miklos Tarnoczy. ...pledge my most vigilant loyalty... ...pledge my most vigilant loyalty... ...and total obedience... ...and total obedience... ...to the Hungarian nation... ...to the Hungarian nation... ...its independence and liberty... ...its independence and liberty... ...and the orders of... ...and the orders of... ...its rightful governor, Lajos Kossuth... ...its rightful governor, Lajos Kossuth... -...my motto is... -...my motto is... ...independence and liberty... ...independence and liberty... - ...or death. - ...or death. There are too few of us, lieutenant. This... invisible army is still weak. Many are cowards. But we still need soldiers even if mere fear holds them back from betraying us. Where are the March Youths, lieutenant? They grew old, nice and quiet. Yes, I don't hold a high opinion of these men! They can't wait to become parts of the establishment. I swear a stint in prison would do them good. They deserve to be reported anonymously. To let them get some training in their cells, or else they'll never fight their way up to become enemies of the establishment! I assume responsibility for this boy. Using what? - Your soldier's honour, lieutenant? - Yes. Those times are over. The invisible army doesn't care about soldier's honour. Here, you answer with your life for everything. On the terror list of the invisible army deserters and traitors are listed along with Franz Joseph and Tzar Nicholas! I'm telling you, be proud of this man here... ...and love him very much. A woman who loves both her husband and country has a hard time. Listen to me, my lady, and remember: petals, flowers, wreaths, bouquets... The petals constitute the flowers, flowers create bouquets and wreaths: that is the organisation. The women's secret group works as a sleeping cell, injecting itself into the invisible army and awaits the signal vigilantly. Thousands of fires will indicate over the country that the time has come, the moment of action has arrived. And in the firelight the members of the invisible army shall become visible, new and new fires will be lit, new and new armies will be born. And the flames shall consume everything, the entire world. Colonel! Colonel! Hungarians! Whoever denies to give due support from our cause in the present circumstances, or fails to give shelter to a true Hungarian or betrays or already betrayed a true Hungarian, I shall hurl his wretched body in front of dogs. Did he dictate this? Yes. - Isn't there more? - There isn't. This is punished by execution... meaning all of us. Perhaps we risk execution, but we must do it! Taking the risk? For an invisible government?! The invisible government exists, but only we can make it visible! Both the government and the army... I've already surrendered once as a member of a visible army! What are these folks thinking?" To command a rebellion from the outside, with orders written on paper? This country... is frightened. The people are complacent. The paper orders are merely to spread the spirit of the revolution, to alert and organise... The colonel is correct! The colonel... He's disappeared into thin air. Your brother is right, he did the right thing! He skipped all this business. - Ferenc Majlath? - Yes. Take him to his room! - Is this your room? - Yes. Take him in! And you? - What's your name? - Miklos Tarnoczy... The young man also comes with us. Fetch him. - Who are you? - Yes?.. I asked you for your name! Kornel Tarnéczy. Get dressed, you're coming with us! What's going on? Mrs Majlath? Yes. - Let him go, please! - What's going on here? Take him outside. - Mommy, I'm scared. - Don't be scared. Take her! Take her already! - Leave me be! - Take her, take her. Leave me alone! Get dressed, madam, you're coming with us! To the attic as well! Who are you? - I'm the nanny... - The nanny. Well, nothing? Let me go. - I don't understand what's going on... - Leave me alone! - Why are you ransacking the house? - Madam, I'm acting on orders. - You can't do this to us! - Take her downstairs! - What do you want? - Take her down! Let me go, let me go! Not there? Take him down! - What happened here?! - Shut your mouth! Me, I'm working in the Interior Ministry... ...I'm a public servant of... That's all the better reason to shut up, sir! Let me go! Madam, I'm giving you one minute to get dressed! Hey! Take him! Take him too! - No! - Hey, take her! Hey now, stop crying, my dearest... - Leave me alone! - Get a move on! Gosh... Onto the carriage! Off you go. I made the arrangements. They'll be here shortly. Thank you. I set you free due to a higher command. From now on, the colonel vouches for you. And Ferenc? I regret to say that he needs to stay here for a couple of days. Higher-ups will decide his verdict. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere without Ferenc! Do you object if we leave the premises right now? No, it's alright... you may leave, colonel. Let's go. Come on now. I'm not going! We have no need for a scandal. Stop jesting around! I'm already as flexible as I will get... I'm not going anywhere without Ferenc! Keep quiet! Knock some sense into him already! No! Don't hurt him! Don't touch him! Let him go! You bastards... - When will daddy come home? - Kindly go to sleep. Poor little kids, they're getting some too. You were asking for this trouble. Come on, my girl. Show me your little face. This house search may go on for weeks, for the time you will make your home at mine. And we may pray that they won't find anything at home, because if they intend to, they will, right? What on earth was the lieutenant thinking? That these mysterious visitors would not be tailed by the police? What could have he done? Should he have locked out his former comrade at arms? Precisely. That would've taken real courage. Now he's just where he desired to be! Cut that out! You're so lowly... What happened? They sent word from the prison. I hope they don't intend to prosecute him. No, it's worse than that. They want you to pay him a visit. I don't get it, they were the ones who didn't allow me to do that. It seems there's a shift in their communication. The note says that Ferenc... ...fell into a depression. Supposedly loneliness has disturbed him so. It appears that he's overestimated his strength. Please, be careful. They'll watch every one of your moves. Don't take any secret notes he might give you, you'd only cause him further trouble. Tell him to confess everything in honesty. The smartest thing is for him to cooperate with the authorities. No... I won't suggest any of that to him. Are you still having trouble seeing that I'm not your enemy? Maria, don't you realise that I'm trying to help? Go in there and make him understand that the fate of the entire family is in his hands. Calm him down and encourage him! Reassure him that the children are all right. And you're all right yourself. No... I'm not all right at all, and neither are the kids. How could they be, when he's not with us? What if you sympathise with other people for a change? Once those folks send notes, trouble is brewing. Do you know, my dear, that I'm haunted by horrible images? All I'm seeing is you dead, day and night. With crushed extremities. I can see clearly as you're being hurled down from the third story corridor, and there you're lying on the prison yard soaked in blood. What... what are you talking about? I'm very afraid. My senses are failing me. They hold magnetic mirrors in front of me to drive me mad. I can see you falling down from the third floor. From the prison window... from the third story. Calm down now. Mariska... you are pale, your hands so cold... Are you ill? Are you even alive yet? Talk to me. I'll believe you. Here I am with you, can't you see? Then why are you dying every day in front of me? Talk louder there! We don't intend to watch you, but to understand your conversation. What do these folks want? Ferenc Majlath, rise! Madam, please come over here. Mrs Ferenc Majlath! Do you declare that you have met with your husband, the felon Ferenc Majlath, this day? Yes. Did you talk to him, did he recognise you, do you declare this? Yes. Ferenc Majlath, do you declare that you've met with your wife on this day, talked to her... You declare that you've accused your captors with bearing false witness with you claiming that your wife is no longer alive. In fact, they caused her death. Do you declare thus? - Do you declare?! - Stop it already! Can't you see that he's a sick man? Madam, please let us carry on with our work! We're not here because we feel like it! We have plenty of other things to do. Your husband has trampled our honour, we gave him pen and paper to confess his crime, and all he did was filling the sheets with the same line: ,,You killed my wife!” He wrote down that line at least 200 times. Madam, please sign the logbook here. - Good day. - Good day. - Maria? - I'll notify her. Maria! Maria, are you asleep? Come on, he's here. I wouldn't wish this day for any of you. I was foolish to listen to you. I was lectured like a snotty urchin. Why did I fail to look after my family - that's what they asked. The Minister of Interior Affairs... ...has told me that he's disappointed in me: Heinrich, he told me, what do you think, if their revolution wins and we end up in their hands, will they show mercy with us? Just because we have families and children? And Ferenc? What'll happen to him? Regarding his state... ...the procedure against him won't carry on further, and he'll be transported from the prison to a mental health asylum. How come? He is not a madman! They intend to lock him up with the deranged?! Do you still fail to realise that he needs this just to survive? There, I've even caught a cold! Would you prefer if they subjected him to a political prosecution? Who the heck guarantees then that he won't be executed?! The minister promised me that... ...Ferenc will stay alive. But at what price?! We've already paid a very high price, and it's bound to increase further! We all need to take that into account. Including you! And including me... But it's a good thing that we're still in a position to be paying. Maria! And you just learn to stay quiet! That awkward fit you had last time is only explicable because that was your first time in prison! I do hope that the 24 hours you spent there will suffice. Was there no other solution? Hmm. No. For God's sake, what else did you think? You were the one to undersign that your husband is a mental case! All I undersigned was that I'm alive. Contrary to Ferenc, who wrote on the sheet pushed under his nose that Maria was killed! He made an attack with the only weapon still left to him! Of course you never understood this! You are deranged. Was I supposed to undersign that I'm dead? You should have denied it. Yes, naturally... lam the one to blame for everything now. But Ferenc also abandoned me! He kept talking like a madman! I was waiting for him to give me a sign, but he wouldn't! He would not? Did you expect him to just explain you in front of the guards how he became an accuser from being an accused, how he managed to arrange seeing you once again? Don't you realise that you've become an accomplice to the uncle and the minister? Leave me alone... Do you know the difference between a political prisoner and a state-owned mental patient?" That is the true death sentence! Congratulations! Believe me, madam, that our institute acts as a hospital for curable cases, and as a true shelter for uncurable cases... Scram! Good day to you, director. Regretfully we don't merely cure our patients here, but we're compelled to confine them as well. - Good day. - Good day. Good day. These days he is very calm and balanced. lam very much satisfied with him. lam sure he'll be joyful to see you. Ferenc... Do you have the patience to read? Well, yes... In the newspapers... there are intriguing news. In Dorottya street... in a mirror depot... ...likely out of carelessness, a fire broke out, which caused... ...up to 300 mirror plates to be shattered... ...to tiny pieces, little shards... Mariska... ...did you know that mirror can burn? Ferenc... We're amongst ourselves here. No one hears us. Is there anything you want to tell me? Are you just acting? You're just playing the way you are, right? Do you aim to fool everyone? Tell me something... Give me a sign that everything is the way it used to be. I'm begging you, give me some sign. For God's sake, open your mouth already! Don't you hear me, Ferenc? Why are you doing this? Mariska, take great care, all of you. The newspapers are full of horrible news, fires. The entire country is on fire... The nights are aflame, they won't let me rest. All of you be very careful. Enter! What is it? An article, advisor, sir. It was published by the Neuer Zilrcher Zeitung. And what does it say? I put a frame around it. I didn't want to send it further until you haven't read it, due to the name under it. Why, what's his name? Majlath. F. Majlath. Indeed? Yes, and if I'm correct, your brother-in-law is called the same, sir. You are correct. So what? This article was written from a mental asylum. An open letter to His Majes... Do you think I'm not able to read? How long have you been here with us? One month. And before that? The letter censorship department... That's nothing to be ashamed of, it's quite a school! Am I not right? Well, thank you for your consideration. Please. Please. I do hope that you know that you're holding Ferenc's death sentence in your hand. An open letter from the mental asylum, addressed straight to the emperor. You see, he did heed my advice after all. He forwarded his message to the authority in charge. No, no, my dearest ones. This is not a jest, I happen to sit on the tree that is being sawed right now. Our head is on the line at this point, the head of this entire honorable family. You were the one who kept visiting him! Did he make you believe that he's a madman? He must be a great actor... And so far his tactic worked out fine, but this time he's targeted too big a player. I made it clear that you should be wary with him! I swear on my childrens' lives, I know nothing! Then who wrote this and who sent it out of the country? I don't know! I don't know! I just swore on it! I had my best experts examine the text. In their opinion all of it point to Ferenc, even if written in German. I share the opinion that he wrote it. Whether he wrote it or not... ahh! I'll visit him and try to convince him to renounce the article. Ferenc could not have written it... He could not have, understand me! He is a sick man, very sick! I wish you were right, Maria, I wish Ferenc had nothing to do with this. But do you realise what would that mean? In that case there exists an organisation in Hungary that reaches all places... including mental asylums. - And our system of checkpoints doesn't wash! - Yes. But it's even worse if the article wasn't written by Ferenc, but those who share his principles. Then they already gave up on him, think he's dead. Then they're exploiting Ferenc's name, abusing it for their own ends. To these revolutionaries... life doesn't mean a thing, only a single thing is sacred and important: the myth and illusion of revolution! At least these folks do believe in something... And perhaps they are right. Only madmen believe in nonexistent things, it is called obsession. Oh you, what do you know about... madmen? Go ahead then, pay him a visit. But I'm oblivious of all this, remember that. I'm resting my case on him. Or perhaps he's the one who wrote it?.. When did you arrive? Did you talk to Ferenc? They told me that he doesn't want to see me. But I hope you didn't believe them. Do you think he wrote it? He wrote it or not, it doesn't make a difference. There's nothing else left, we'll send word to Ferenc that he may commence his hunger strike. Are you bent on driving him into mortal danger?.. I mean to help Ferenc, and heed my words: no one will stop me in that! You have no right for this. Ferenc is sick. Don't you get it? He's sick! At first, I thought that he's acting, that he's playing a role. But no: they really drove him insane. I shall resurrect his spirit then, I'll word the letter of prosecution for him, addressed straight to his majesty. And I shall write everything in it that only a madman would dare to write in this country! You can write whatever you want on my account. But in your own name! It's not you who's in danger of being executed! Don't you understand that it's the article itself that could save Ferenc? They'll need to account for it in front of the international public, and whatever might happen, Ferenc won't be abandoned by the invisible army! Dreams! Unreal dreams! Petals, flowers, bouquets, wreaths, hours, minuntes, strings: you are out of your mind! You don't aim to rescue Ferenc, you aim to get imprisoned along with him! Prison bars seem to attract you! But I don't want to lose any of you! Should I lose everyone whom I love?.. Miklos, please... let us go home. Where to? Uncle Heinrich? You'd take me right home like poor Ferenc... You'd better renounce me then! How dare you talk to me like that?! Don't you understand what I'm telling you? Thank you. We'll arrange it quickly, ten minutes in all. You're not holding me up, advisor. Kindly take a seat. I don't mean to burden you. Come now, advisor, it is our mutual interest to be able to solve this unpleasant case. Then do what it takes, please. - Would you like a cigar? - No! I told you, I'm in a hurry!! Apologies, apologies. It's alright. Watch out... this is the valley of lost souls. Still, it's not that bad here, fear not. Ferenc... How do you do, Kornel? Fine... I miss you, Ferenc. Tell me, why did you leave me? I'm not as strong as you are, you know? I'm restless, Ferenc. I don't sleep at night... my head is throbbing. I'm in love with the very principles... ...that I'm supposed to stamp out in my day job! At night I get up and jot down everything, then I burn them in the morning! Do not pity me!.. I'm not as talented as you are. You know... My task is to pursue evil and trash... and to protect the good! For nothing but alms, my friend... For alms, and you need to know that! But... ...I'm one of those who are sculpting the image of the empire today! And that feels good. You've put me in a state of torment, Ferenc... At least you could've given me chance to try to dissuade you. I value your bravery, but this game ends with the last man standing! You're saying you cannot sleep either? Get real now! Stop jesting! Sign this! You must sign this! You need to announce that they abused your name! Do you understand, Ferenc? I'm not signing anything, Kornel... You need to do this, need to sign this, that they've abused your name! - That is, that is all! - I want to go back... lam not hurting you, Ferenc, I'm not! This is not for my sake, not for me, this is for you, sign it, sign it, sign it! - No! - Ferenc! - Leave me alone! - Ferenc! Kornel!
