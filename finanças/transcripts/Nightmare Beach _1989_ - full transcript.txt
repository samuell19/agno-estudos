If that's true, then what can we do? - The only thing we can do is pray, brother. Pray. - First they waste Diablo. Now they snatch Dawg. They're trying to wipe us out. - [Man] Yeah! - Are we gonna sit around and take it like a bunch of pussies? - [Man] No, no way. - Goddamn right. I'm gonna go free my brother.
