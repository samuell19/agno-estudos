"REBEL CITY 1953" In the year 1864, although Kansas was loyal to the Union... there were many supporters of the Confederacy. As the two governments tolerated trade... of non-military products, the city has become... the center of trade between north and south. It was also chosen to host a secret organization, of the "Copperheads", committed to the defeat of the Union. They believed the south would win the war... and they decided to bet on the winner... "Connection to Wichita and the whole south". Come in, sir. You're next. Frank Graham. It's been a long time. - It's been a long time, Sam. - I'm sorry for your father. Thanks. Mr. Frank. Hello, William. I'm glad you received my letter. Your father was a good man. - How did it happen? - He said he was going to sell the wagons. Sell ​​the wagons? Why? - That business was his life. - He said it was... too old to handle transport alone. You didn't want any of that. In addition, he would not reject the money they offered him. So I went to Belfry with him. We load the wagons. I waited at the hotel while he closed deals with the buyer. So I only saw him once. When he crawled back with the money in his hand... and a knife in the back. He said just one word before he died. -Falsified! -Falsified? That's what he said. $ 2,000 dollars. $ 2,000 dollars? It is double the value of the wagons. Yes sir. So, he was going to sell them. And none of the notes are worth a penny. - Has anyone seen what happened? - Not. I spoke to the sheriff and the army. They didn't even hear me. They were all very busy. What does the army have to do with it? Now they are in Belfry. And they also occupied our stables here. - The army? - I'm just telling you what I know. I was lucky to get a job with Sam. Thank you, William. DO NOT PASS ELI GRAHAM TRANSPORT COMPANY US ARMY DEPOSIT Hey, can't you read? - Who is responsible? - He's watching. I thought the army had taken that place. They did, but the soldiers have other jobs. I want to talk to whoever took possession of this place. I don't understand, sir, but if you want to claim, Talk to Captain Ramsey. I just work here. Who is he? He is responsible for this area. You'll find him at the army post in Belfry. Thanks. This is not a good thing, Ramsey. It is not a good thing. Last week, they blew up the bridge at Devil's Crossing. Today they attacked our soldiers while training in the field. The Copperheads are being very bold. We have to find your leaders soon... or we will have real problems. In between. Yes? A gentleman wants to see Captain Ramsey, sir. What does he want? Do not know. He looks angry. Let him come another time. We're busy. You will not make me come back. I want to see Captain Ramsey. My name is Ramsey. Who are you? - Frank Graham. - What happened? - It's about my dad, Eli Graham. - What's up with him? He was murdered. It is a pity. But why do you come here? Is this how the army negotiates? With fake money? What are you talking about? My father died with this in his hand and a knife in the back. I still don't know what that has to do with us. My father owned the Junction City transportation company. They informed me of his death, and when I returned home, I found out... that the military is using their properties as a deposit. The army has the right to do so. With murder and fake money? I guarantee that the army had nothing to do with it. We take possession of the Junction City stable... because nobody claimed. I remember Graham was killed here in Belfry... for a discussion about the sale of wagons. Like the discussion about wagons? Doesn't the army have them? No, we don't have them. We just found the room empty. Didn't Spencer, responsible for there, make that clear to you? This did not happened. Clearly, we will pay now that you are here. That is not the point. I know my father was killed. I want to know who did this and why. Claim in writing and we will take action in due course. Can't you do something now? You forget that we are in the middle of a war. In addition to the problems with the Copper Heads. Should we drop everything because someone died in a fight? It's not that important, sir. - For me yes. - But not for me. Good night sir. That is all. It barks more than it bites. But everyone expects miracles. I just want help, not a miracle. Be reasonable, Graham. You have to wait your turn. When? In a year? It won't be that long. I will process the documents and put a man in it. Documents? - For what? - You know how it is, everything passes through the channels of the army's bureaucracy. There is no bureaucracy to hold me back. This is your business. But you informed me. If you find something that can help us in the investigation... I would like to know. - How can I help you, sir? - Just a minute of your time. - Have you seen any of these before? - A $ 100 bill is a lot of money. I'm new here. I've never seen a note like that. Thanks. That's all I wanted to know. By the way, who do I talk to to rent a room? I can handle this. How long will you stay? Two days, a week. Who knows? It's ok. Room n ° 4. Going up the stairs on the right. Thanks. BELFRY TRANSPORT COMPANY Wm. Dudley, owner. You can put that in 3. - Good morning Good Morning. - I'm looking for the boss. - Then look for me. - Where's Bill Dudley? - My brother is in Virginia... with the 57th infantry. What can I do for you? My name is Frank Graham. My father owned a... Northern shipping company in Junction City. Yes, I met him. He was a perfect gentleman. Thanks. Did you hear about his death? Yes. He told me about his son, who left home and became a player. My father lived his life and I live mine. Now that you're here, how can I help you? I'm trying to locate the cars my father sold. If I had known he was going to sell his cars, I would have bought them myself. - The team is worth its weight in gold. - I'll find out. He received $ 2,000 dollars for his wagons. This is a lot of money. - It would be, if they were good. - Why aren't they good? They are fake. It's terrible. The army occupied its stable. This is common in times of war. The army can occupy any available space. Is that you? Did you have a problem? - Not at all. - I would say it's luck. I know who to trust and who not to trust. - And who would it be? - You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Graham. Good Morning. Hello, Lloyd. Captain Ramsey, this is Mr. Graham. Yes, we already met. Mr. Graham asked me a lot of questions. I'm trying to find out who killed my father. - I wish you luck. - I came to look for information and I couldn't. - Now, I would like something else. - What? A job. If I go to the transport sector, I will find some clue. She runs a business, Mr. Graham. Whoever she hires must be able to handle horses... and that is reliable. - Is it you or him who hires? - I agree with Captain Ramsey. You don't want a job, you want to find a clue. I doubt it's reliable. Why don't you let me try and check it out? You've tried and failed. If you were here when your father needed you... he would still be alive. - You were very tough. - I don't know what happened to me. I offended that man. - Don't worry, Jane. - But I need a man. I don't know why it made me so upset. If you don't want it, I'll bring you a driver. Trustworthy. Sir, Graham! Mr. Graham, I need a driver, if you're still interested. - I'm interested. - Great. We will start work tomorrow morning at 8:00. - I'll be here. - And leave your letters at home. - You don't approve? - Not. She needs help, but someone reliable. She is a young worker. Mr. Graham, excuse me for everything I said. Do not worry. You spoke the truth. Now, if you'll excuse me. Do you chew tobacco? Pencil, scarf? - Give me a bag of tobacco, Perry. - Yes sir. A bag of the best tobacco in town. Here it is. ELI GRAHAM'S SON IS IN THE CITY. - Good morning Good Morning. Do you chew tobacco? Pencil, scarf? No thank you. Have you seen any of these before? - I've seen some. - Take a good look at this. It is false. Where did you find this? Do you mind if I take a look at you, Mr. Hardy? Yes, I need to be vigilant for that. Well, I have to continue. Hey, if you need anything, call old Perry. For anything. Are you sure you’ve never seen one of these before? No sir. I'm having enough problems with that too. Herb. This counterfeit bill is circulating in the city. Take a good look at them so they don't cheat you. Pete. Do not accept any of these notes. I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Fine thanks. I just wanted to ask. Why are you coming here? I've been to all places in the city before finishing. Bye. - He's talking to Hardy. - Do not worry about it. - We can take care of him. - Hey, I'm just telling you. No sir. Counterfeiting is not my business. And wagons, Mr. Temple? Have you bought any lately? I also do not transport. Ask Mrs. Dudley at the freight office. She does my transports. And did she buy some wagons? She can answer you better than I can. I just asked. Good afternoon sir. How can I help? - A nice watch, maybe? - Have you seen one of these before? No. I don't know anything about that. I'm busy with an order. What do you know about counterfeiting? I already told you that nothing fake happened. And I never accepted any. Do you know someone who has? - No. - Maybe you're telling the truth. I will see you again. - Eddie. - I'm going in. - You haven't bet yet. - You're right, calm down. - It's my money. - If you want to drink, go to the bar. Look, you have nothing to complain about me. You better play more and drink less. I'm not telling you how to play cards. I open with $ 10. I see and raise $ 20. I see your $ 20... And I raise $ 20. And another $ 20. I see. Cards? I will keep these. Two. I bet $ 50. He's bluffing. There is only one way to know. I cover. And I raise $ 50. Just a moment. Where's your money? - I have money. - Let's see it. - I have money. - Show or shut up. I say the same. I can buy and sell to many of you. - Where did you find this? - Do not know. You better start talking. Where does this note come from? Well, it must be coming from somewhere. - He returned. - Where's Greeley? - Who? - Greeley. - The man who just came in. - I'm sorry. You must be mistaken. - Do you mind if I look? - Do not enter. We're busy. I think I'm wrong. Thank you anyway. Your welcome. Hurry up. We have to get back to work. Pete, get some paper from the store. No, this is not the size. I want the one in the box. - Where did you find this? - They almost stabbed me in the back. I wouldn't be so happy about it. For your own sake, why don't you leave it to the authorities? They are used to dealing with that kind of thing. They are very slow for me. I think you are too old to know how to take care of yourself. Help the boys with this shipment. According. And it all. - Ready to go? - Yes All right. And during unloading, Mr. Watson will sign the delivery. And the guards at the inspection station... - they will check. - Guards? For what? The Copperheads pass through here. All shipments are inspected. But you shouldn't have any problems. Hope not. Hey, what are you doing? Excuse. I thought it was someone else. - You saw that he attacked me. - It was a mistake. Yes, but in this city we don't make those mistakes, sir. Yes, I already said... Luckily, Fred saw the cart and brought it back here. Mr. Graham, I hired you because I needed a driver. Again, before I trust a player, I'm going to drive myself. - Sir, Graham, you are fired! - Dudley, let me explain. Explain what? Why didn't you trust me? - You had a chance to try... - Forget it. Wait. He's hurt. What happened? They attacked and robbed me. They stole the only evidence about counterfeit money. - I'm sorry. - Not as much as I. Let's heal this. This time, stay out of trouble, please. What happened? - Greeley. - Is dead. I will take you to the headquarters. Drive, sir. - Why did you do that, Graham? - I didn't. You don't die every day with a knife in your back. - They put it in the car. - I've heard that before. I never saw that fail. Keep your head warm and you will encounter problems. You couldn't wait. You couldn't let the authorities handle your father's murder. No, you had to find the killer and deal with him. How do you know? - Know what? - Who's the killer. - Do not know? - Do not know yet. I found him yesterday with fake bills. I only know that he was murdered like my father. And that someone tried to kill me in the same way. Graham... it leaves me no choice but to arrest him for murder. I didn't kill him. Why don't you talk to Jane Dudley? The car is yours. She signed the shipment. She knows better than I what I was carrying. I don't know how it can help you in your situation. - Tell Miss. Dudley to come. - Yes sir. What Miss Dudley told us... about leaving the car alone... and that you were attacked... I would say that it changes things. Graham, I released you, but in Miss Dudley's custody. I would like you to reconsider, Jane. You are taking chances for a stranger. I know what I'm doing, Lloyd. - I think he's innocent. - It will cost you. I'm willing. You're not going to run from me, are you? - It's difficult. - Speaking clearly, Graham. This does not mean that it is free. Miss Dudley will be responsible for your actions. And you will do whatever she says. Tell her what you will do and where you will be. Yes sir. Dudley, sign this document, please. And you can go, Graham. Take your weapons when you leave. Thank you, Colonel. - Thank you, captain. - Don't thank me. - Thank the lady. - I'll do it. You know, they say that a gift horse doesn't look at its teeth. But I can't help it. I am curious. Why did it? I mean, why are you taking risks for me? Well, I need a driver. And I think you are innocent. But after saying that I am irresponsible. Do you prefer to go back to jail? Do not understand. I came after the man who killed my father... I found Greeley and thought I would have found it. Now he is dead. I was beaten, robbed, stabbed and arrested for murder. Frank, please. Leave that to the authorities. No thank you. It's my business and I'll go to the end. Dick. - How much do I owe? - $ 0.60. - Keep the change. - Thanks. Graham. Save this. I want to talk to you. All right. I'm listening. Do you know who you are facing? The copper heads. They are powerful and organized. - How do you know? - I was one of them. Was? I joined them because they were against the war... but then your goal changed. What do you know about my father's death? Nothing. - Falsification? - I'm an engraver and a jeweler. I made the plates for forgery. The fake money would be used... to buy equipment for the Confederation. We hoped to flood the north with counterfeit bills. - Where are the signs? - Do not know. - Who did you give them to? - A man named Greeley. - What did he do with them? - Do not know. They operate in secret and I never knew who the leaders are. I went to the authorities this afternoon and talked to Colonel Barnes. - Yes, I know him. - You want me to make a list... of the copper heads I know, I will deliver it tomorrow. - Have you done it? - I'm going to the store to do it. I'll go with you. I want to see that list. They cannot see us together. How can I help you? Do you have a cargo to take to Junction City? Yes. - I'll come and get you. - And Fred, the regular driver? - Now I'm the driver. - I prefer Fred. He went on another trip and I will go on this one. Well, no hard feelings, but... I have many valuable things coming and going from the north. - Fred takes care of that for me. - Go see the boss. Dudley knows that I trust Fred. You will have to discuss this with her. Do I carry the load or not? No, tell Miss. Dudley I want a known driver. - I wonder why. - He kept asking me about Fred. - I don't see what difference there is. - What are you going to do now? We will talk to Mr. Temple. Mr. Temple, I heard that you don't like my driver. I prefer to meet the man who transports my goods. - Graham works for me. - It doesn't concern me.... but Mr. Temple called me and Mr. Graham is suspected of... murder, that is the question. - I wouldn't feel comfortable. - I am responsible for the cargo. And I am also responsible for Graham. - He'll be away from town. - I'm going with him. - I don't think it's a good idea. - I still make my decisions, Captain. Now, do we carry the load or not? According. Help him load. - Are you going to download it here? - Yes. Now I work for Miss Dudley. - We bring a shipment from Acme. - It's ok. I need to take a load of glass, curtains and supplies. Everything is waiting. We will download it as soon as possible. Boys, the Acme shipment has arrived. It will take about an hour. I have to take care of some things. Me too. See you later. - Spencer. - Yes? Have you ever heard of a man named Greeley? Greeley? I can't say yes. I found out that he spent a lot of time here. Maybe yes. I don't know everyone. Greeley, isn't it? Right. Wasn't he the one who used to stay in his father's stable? Do not know. I believe so? Well... I haven't seen him around since Mr. Graham died. Ask Joe Spencer from the warehouse, they were friends. I will. Thanks. FRAGILE - GLASS TRANSPORT - CARE You never heard of Greeley, did you, Spencer? You don't know everyone in town. Not even your good friends. What do you want to know about Greeley? Why don't you ask him? Is dead. We will all die one day. Be careful with this box. ELI GRAHAM TRANSPORT COMPANY Spencer, where did you get those cars? - It doesn't matter to you. - They belonged to my father. - Well, now they belong to us. - To whom? I already told you that I don't like questions, Graham. Like it or not, you will answer me. Stop this! Stop! Stop! - Who shot? - That was bothering me. - Who are you? - Frank Graham. I knew it was this way. Spencer didn't tell me how he got my dad's wagons. It's none of your business. - I say he stole them. - I never said they were mine. - Who's the owner? - The company Acme... - the belfry. - Acme? - What are you doing here? - Look, Graham. I already told you that I only work here. Ask the right people, not me. - That makes sense, Graham. - I wish I could say the same. Okay. Spencer. You won this round. But there is another one to play. Is the shipment ready? - It is. - Let's go. Go slow. Remember that you have glass. Relax, Frank. Greeley bought my dad's wagons with fake money. He sold them to Temple, owner of Acme. Acme does business with the military. Temple leaves them to Spencer, who works for the army. If they were the copperheads, they are close to the army. Look! - What does he think about that? - I don't like it. 4 miles to go. Do you think we can make it if we run? With that load? They would pick us up within a mile. We will try. Go faster, Frank. We will make it. Protect them. Continues! Continues! - Oh, we did it. - No, thanks to us. They would have reached us if they wanted. Do not understand. Why didn't they fire before we got to the checkpoint? They were not looking for problems. They were sent to protect the contents of this wagon. Those guys were supposed to guarantee... that we would pass without being inspected. - Because? - That's what I want to know. Jane. - What do we do? - That's a good question. Spencer, Temple and the rest must be the copperheads. They needed the wagons for smuggling. They used theirs and my dad's. We have to work fast. Give me that canvas. Do as I say. Bring Colonel Barnes. Neither Ramsey nor anyone else. Only Colonel Barnes. Yes, Frank. Why are they taking so long? They should have arrived 10 minutes ago. - If something goes wrong... - Nothing will go wrong. - Should I take a look? - Yes - It's coming. - Ari, Jack, come with me. The rest are out of sight. - I'm here, gentlemen. - It was time. Help unload. Here, sign this. Thanks. Good Morning. - Where's the colonel? - Are you busy. He sent Captain Ramsey in his place. I found out that you found army rifles. Rifles? What rifles? This is not a game, Graham. Smuggling rifles is serious business. As serious as murder. I should have known that. I'm in both. And it is an accusation that I will not endure. - He seems very sure of himself. - I know all the answers. And they all come from outside. The copper heads are helping the south... with the smuggling of weapons and materials. You are in the perfect position for this. Also, you like the color of that money. - Do you think you have evidence? - I'll start from the beginning. Greeley had a request to distribute counterfeit money at different points. He made the mistake of passing it on to my father. My father noticed and he killed him. When I followed him, he was removed from the middle. The same happened with Spain when it was going to expose the copper heads. - I still want proof. - That's easy. You will prove it to yourself... in one minute. - Where are the rifles? - The test, at the indicated time. Nothing could be better, could it, Ramsey? It could and will be. Once you're out of our way. - You've been trying for a long time. - This time, I can do it. Before you tell us what you did with the rifles. I've been playing for a long time to waste an ace up my sleeve. Give me your weapons. Come and get them. As long as I have the rifles... nobody will shoot. What is all this? - What happened, Graham? - Just in time, Colonel. It also worries you. Captain Ramsey has plans for all of us. Plans? He has protected the leader of the copperheads, colonel. - Than? - Colonel, consider yourself my prisoner. Order the surrender of the garrison and all facilities. Arrest that man. - I'm going to take a detour. - According. All right. Drop your weapons. Get them out of here. The Union owes you a debt of gratitude, Graham. I got what I was looking for, Colonel. I hope your hand improves. It is a small price to clean the house. I will return all of his father's properties. Graham is a player, a colonel, not a transporter. - Thank God. - Thanks to you. - Bye. - Bye. Goodbye, colonel. - You're leaving, right? - Yes I am. I think I will have to hire a new driver. Is what it seems. I don't see how to work for you and... run my own company at the same time. I bet you will merge your company with mine. - I would never bet against that. - Why not? I never bet against the favorite. Translation Editing and Synchronization by WesternKasa /GM NOV2020
