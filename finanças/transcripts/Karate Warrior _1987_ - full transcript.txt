- The captain wishes to inform you that we are now clearing the approach to Manila International Airport and shall be arriving in 10 minutes. Taxi? Taxi, mister? - Okay. - Come on! This way. My taxi very nice. Don't need air conditioning, get in, come on, come on. Oh, I'm gonna tell you, if you want girls, I got girls. If you want boys, I got boys! Manila is my backyard, man! Let's go! Where to? - What? - Where do you want to go? Oh yeah, Los Panes. My father lives there. First time you come to Manila, huh? Yeah, that's right, first time. But your father live here, huh? Yeah. Sounds complicated, man. Manila one great city, man. Manila has everything. Ever had fried rat? We got fried rat in Manila. Real delicacy, you're gonna like it. You're gonna like everything here, you're gonna like. You like girls? Now, you want some girls, I'll get girls. There's girls, see those girls? You like those girls? You should not like those girls, because they got the clap. 10 American dollars. This is Los Panos? No, this the tick tick station. Those tick tick go to Los Panos. I'm not going to Los Panos, understand? - Okay. - 10 American dollars. Thank you. Hey, Americano. It's not good to have with you so much money! - Excuse me, does this car go to, uh, Los Panos? Over there. That side? Okay, what time is it? - One, yeah. - One o'clock? - Can I help you? - Hi, I'd like a hamburger. No hamburgers. A hotdog? No hotdog. Well, on the other hand. This stuff looks kinda interesting. What is this? Chicken. It's very good. Okay, I'll have one. - Okay. - How much is it? Two dollars, sir. Thank you, sir. Hey, what you want, huh? Money! Pussy! Fuck you, asshole! - Hey, Walkman. - Look, look! Uh, hey! Hey- - Hey- Here we are. Where? We arrive at Los Panos. Oh, okay, thanks. Hey, wait, look where you're going! What did you say, American? You almost hit me. Oh, really? Maybe that's because I don't think much of mosquitoes. Do you know this mosquito? - Hey, I'm not laughing. - What do you think, man? - Shouldn't have done that. Antony, it's good to see you! Dad. God, I've missed you. I've missed you, too. - Sorry I'm late, I didn't expect you to get here so soon. Evening, Quino. - Evening, Mr. Shakespeare. Your boy was rude to us. - Say you're sorry you did it, then let's get outta here. The guy almost ran me over. - Look, it doesn't matter, just say you're sorry, all right? Go on. Sorry, man, take it easy. All right, let's go. You know, Antony, I'm really sorry I couldn't have been at the airport to meet you, but, they just needed somebody here in case it blew up with the rebels and the government. I'm the elected guy. It's getting real sticky down here lately. It's not exactly a popular assignment. But then again, your father is not a very popular journalist anymore. So, here I am. Here you are. Lucky guy. It's good to see you. That's probably going to taste a little strange in the beginning, but urn, it's good, it's nourishing. That's the important thing. Although, to look at you... Look at you, I would say you don't need much help in the growing-up department. You've certainly come a long way in two years. Three, Dad. It's been three years. Hm. Well, look, I didn't know what you wanted. So, here it is, let's eat. So, how's school? Good. - Have you figured out which college you wanna go to yet? - I don't know yet, I still have another year of school. Mom wants me to go to Harvard. Oh, yeah'? How's your mom? She's fine. I'd say she's fine. Has she, um, has she changed much? You mean, does she have another man? No. I just, urn, I just wanna know how she was, that's all. She has a New Yorker. A rich New York lawyer and she sees him, every weekend. - Antony, why don't you try some more fish? You want to buy now? - How much? - This is 10 dollar. Five dollars. No, no, 10 dollar. Five, not a dollar more. Mm-mm. What's the matter? Uh, nothing. You're really beautiful. You're the most beautiful thing I've seen since I got here. Thank you. I'm Antony. Maria. I'm American. It shows. It does? Are you on vacation? No. I'm visiting my father. Are you on vacation? No, I live here. My parents own a store on Johnson Street. I see. - I must go now, bye. - No, hey! Wait, can I see you again? - Bye. - Okay, may I have this please, this one here? That's 12 dollar. You said 10 before! Before, but now 12 dollar. Damn. I don't have any money. All right, no money, no collar. Okay, I'll be right back, okay? Don't sell it, okay, please? All right. Dad, can I have 12 bucks? It's for something important. - What do you need 12 dollars for, to gamble it away? - I just met a nice girl, I wanna get her a necklace. Her father has a store on, uh... Johnson Street. Oh, yeah, that's really very nice. Why don't you get something? Does that red bike the garage work? - That bike hasn't worked in over two years. Okay- - Wait. - Yeah? - Aside from a couple of pigs on that street, there's nothing worth more than a couple of bucks. Okay- Okay, I'll have this. - Now it cost you 15 dollar. - Apart from pigs here, there's nothing worth more than a couple of bucks, huh, all right, okay? Okay? Okay- Pass me the wrench, please, over there. - When did you become this mechanical genius anyway? How'd you learn this stuff'? A buddy, years ago. I wanted to become a race driver, but Mom didn't want me to get involved. That's what happened to me, so what happened to you? Okay- I'll tell you what happened. I discovered some important guys were cheating on safety measures at a nuclear power plant. And on top of that, they spread some hush money around to the very people who are responsible for checking out these safety measures. So I wrote a series of articles responsible for bringing the company to court and that's when the fun started. So, what happened then? I fought them as long as I could. But they were too big for me. One day they set me up and I took a fall. So you ran away over here? That's what happened? You just disappeared. Antony, the truth is, you better know exactly what you're getting into. It's not as easy as it looks. Antony, I had no choice. Hey, come on, let's get up. Let's get this carburetor going. I hope this thing runs. Okay, try her out. I'll try it out tomorrow morning. - It's a very small shop, how can we pay so much? It's impossible! - The other stores don't make so many problems like you. You have a store here, you pay. You pay me like everybody else! We have only enough to live. You're starting to really bore me. - Hi, Maria. - Hello, Antony. What're those guys doing here? - Nothing, really, wanna take me for a ride? Quino, I do the best I can. - Sure, but first I'd like to know what they're doing here. Wanna take me for a ride, please? Let's go now. Really, now. - Okay. If you're really sure now. - Yes. ' Here. For me? It's really very pretty. Thanks. I bet she made you pay at least 12 dollars. That old lady is a thief. Paid two, I paid two. I don't believe you, but thanks anyway. You shouldn't have done it. I don't like it. - But I saw- - Antony, please. Because I like bartering at the market, but I never buy anything. - I was starting to think you were a little crazy. Yeah,yeah,l do. - You might be right, how about coming with me to San Pe? " Me? Yeah, it's not that far. We could be there in less than an hour. - Okay, but on one condition, you've gotta tell me what that goon Quino was doing in your store. - You're really hard-headed, aren't you? It's my only defect. - Quino's a crook, he's part of a protection racket and bleed my parents and everyone else in business between here and Manila. Why don't you tell the police? Because everyone's scared of him. I don't believe it. You don't believe it 'cause you aren't one of the villagers. Quino's heartless, you don't know what he's capable of. But it's ridiculous. - To an American it's ridiculous, but not to us. We're poor and Quino has threatened to burn everything we have if we tell on him. - That's cowardice. That's cowardice! - Giving into Quino is not cowardice, it's wise. Look, you're not able to convince me. It is unbelievable that somebody like Quino can scare you. It even gets me that the day I arrived, my father asked me to apologize to him. And he was right. But Why? - Quino is one of the greatest karate fighters ever. He was a student of a Grand Master, Kimura. - So now Quino thinks he can push everybody around, huh? - Kimura has been the greatest master of karate for the last 40 years, people consider him almost a god. Being his student is enough to scare people. It means you're invincible. - Nobody's invincible, not even Quino! I wanna show you something. This elimination qualification's held every year, in honor of Grand Maestro Kimura. Where is he now? He just disappeared four years ago. He used to be famous all over the orient, but, but then he found that karate shouldn't be used for violence to cause people harm. Quino was his best pupil and he just dishonored him. Huh, they're not fooling around. - It's a great honor for a boy to win the Kimura Tournament. Quino's won it for five straight years. Really? Girls admire him, he's the best. Then there's no hope for me? These guys are really serious! Like I said. It's a great honor for anyone to win a Kimura Tournament. What a blow, my god. What happens now? Then they announce the winner. The eliminations are finished. Isn't that Quino? Hey, that's enough! Oh, shit, now what? I don't know. You're the brave one. Smile! Let's get outta here. Come on, hurry! Jump on the back, come on! Hurry up, they're coming! Stop them, over there! They've caught up with us. I'm gonna show them a trick or two. Quino might be a karate champ, but now we're gonna have some fun! I'm a cross champ. Watch out! Now we can go home. - You're crazy and you're going to get yourself in trouble. Hey, how's that thing runnin'? Real nice. Dad, you know, last year I won a race, a motocross race. In Riverside, California. - No kidding. - Yeah. I didn't know you were that good. - Do you remember the little bike I learned on? Yeah. It was a, it was an American Flier. It was red and silver. With, with big and flat wheels. Yep- And little training wheels, too. - You used to run alongside me, in case I fell down. You never did. No. Where is it now? I wonder what happened to that. It just kind of, you know, disappeared. Like all things do that you don't think about too much. I never thought about it before. Well, I saw you outside. You don't need training wheels anymore. Hey, by the way. You're gonna be in charge here tomorrow. I have to go to Manila on business. Yeah? ' Okay? Now, back to work. What do you want? What do you want? - You wanna know? - Yes. Are you scared? Yesterday, on the bike, very good. Now it's time for me! Come on, we teach this prick a lesson. Let's go, move it! Come on, boy. I show you the sights of the city. This way. Bring him down here. Let's go, white boy! Time for a ride! Smile. . HEY- Hey, listen. Last night, I was just kidding around. I didn't wanna upset you. Okay? I'm willing to apologize. Huh? - I don't shake hands with someone who's chicken. I'm not chicken. Are you? So let's fight. Don't worry. I'm a man of honor. We fight, just you and me. Do I have any choice? No. Okay- According to Olympic rules. Okay- Come on. Knock him on his ass! Yes, fork his eyes! Quino, enough! Now you can apologize. You really want me to? Yes. Well? You can go to hell. No, you go first! Piece of shit. You killed him. So what? Hey, Antony, I'm home, where are ya? Hey! Oh, my god. What a mess. Maria? What happened here? Where's Antony, huh? - He's not here. He's not here. I found it like this, he just disappeared. Disappeared? What do you mean disappeared? What is this mess? Where's my son? - Well, well, we were supposed to see each other this morning, but, but he didn't show up. Those guys, I came here and saw the state of your house. - You know what's going on here, don't you? Maria, who did this? - Last night, Antony got in trouble with Quino. What has Quino done to my son? - I don't know, Quino's capable of anything. What do you want? Quino, I'm looking for my son. And you came looking for him here? - Well yeah I know you guys had a little trouble last night. - Oh it was nothing serious, just kidding around. On my honor, I don't know where he's at. Liar! - I don't like being called a liar, not even by a girl. - Liar, you're a liar, what have you done to Antony? What have you clone to him? - Please, please, please. This is not helping matters. Just stay calm. Quino, I don't have any reason to doubt your word, but if you know anything about the disappearance of my son, you better tell me about it. - Or what? I'm not the kind of man to make threats, but if you've done anything with Antony, you're gonna find yourself in a whole lot of trouble. - Really? - Count on it, Quino. And that goes for the house, too. You had your say, now it's my turn. - Come on, let's get outta here before he hurts himself. Julia, look, I'm telling you, all that I know is that he had a run-in with some local gang. Yes, of course I phoned the police. They're out looking for him everywhere. The whole village is out looking for him. Look, I don't think there's any reason for you to come here right now. I'm well aware that you're his mother. Okay, you do what you wanna do. Now listen, tell me the flight number and I'll pick you up at the airport. Bye bye. Ah, good morning. Who are you? It is not polite to ask a question without saying your name. Antony. My name is Antony. Don't move, Antony. Don't move. Your neck is badly twisted. You have had a nasty blow. You can say that again. Maybe I should talk to my father. He'll be worried, where's a phone? There are no phones in the forest. You may contact your father tomorrow. Now you must remain quiet. Try to relax. You must not talk. Relax, relax the muscles in your neck. Think only of this now. You must relax now! What are you going to do? Don't worry, just relax! Relax, that's easy to say. Start by breathing. Your kind do not know how to breathe properly. Watch me. Look at me. Relax. Relax! Relax. Relax! Relax, relax! My neck, my neck doesn't hurt anymore. It's back in place. How'd you do that? - How is not important. It is important that we succeed. Did you find me in the forest? Yes. I'm beginning to regret it. But I didn't imagine you would be so talkative. You want me to leave? It is enough that you be quiet. My lips are sealed. Well, thank you. Are you very religious? I am a monk. I live in contemplation. I left the city because there is too much talk. When you wish to talk, you use your thought. The tongue has other uses. Now, you be quiet! What's wrong? Bitter. Why do you eat them? - How can I tell leaf are bad if I don't chew leaf? You don't look like someone who looks for trouble. I'm beginning to understand those that beat you. If you have to treat me so bad, why did you bother saving me? Have you ever wondered how many herbs there are in the forest? No, no. Can I ask you a question? No. You eat it. You eat it, you are still weak. No way, I'm not gonna eat that gunk. It's not gunk. Good. You eat it. Feel better. Much better. Go on! Mm, good. How was it? This tastes like shit. Well, you're right. Very disgusting. But in a little while, you will no longer have pain. But I'll have a stomach ache instead. That is impossible. It is most important to know the herbs. They can sometimes save life or make it more pleasant. That one can make you into a very great lover, but you're still too very young to appreciate that. I'm almost 18. Yes. Right age. To make many mistakes. If you survive, you have good hopes of growing old. And if you don't survive, you have no hope whatsoever. - Are you telling me that I make a lot of mistakes? A wise man does not get hit. Listen, listen, you don't know this guy. I'd like to have seen you. There were three of them, besides Quino. What's wrong, man, did I say something I shouldn't have? What's wrong? Holy shit! How'd you see it? I saw it with the eyes of my mind. What? - The mind sees things sometimes before the eye. Let's go home. - Julia, over here, come on. - Have you found Antony? No, but he's okay, I've got some news. Here, get in. I'll tell you about it on the way, I'll put this in here. Julia, you look terrific. Here, I got this message last night after you left Boston. He's somewhere in the forest with a monk. - In the forest with a monk, what do you mean? He's fine, there are no problems. He said he'll be back in about 10 days or so. ' 10 days'? Now listen to me, Paul Scott, I want my son. Not one of your headline stories. - Ah, Julia, you haven't changed much, have ya? I didn't come to this bloody place to discuss my personality. - And when did you start using language like that? - Since you started pretending not to understand it. Who is Kimura? Kimura. Maestro Kimura. He's like a god around here, he's a hermit. He's been living the forest for years and years. - In the forest, and to think I've enrolled him in the best college in Boston. Oh, we haven't eaten since yesterday. Aren't you hungry? The mind needs no food. But the body does. It's the mind that commands the body. Ah, but I'm hungry. Listen to me, Antony Scott. I've been thinking, that destiny sent you to me. I don't get it. You will help me... Atone for my guilt. For years I taught the terrible secrets of the martial arts. My name was renowned and feared through all the orient. I created a school of warriors, with whom I also... Tried to teach honor. But then... I understood that one student used my teachings to do terrible harm. That is Quino. My best pupil. Kimura? You're Maestro Kimura? I was once Maestro Kimura. But now, I'm a simple monk, who seeks forgiveness through God's prayers always. But God sent you to me. And made sure. Do you know why? He wants me to teach you karate, to beat Quino. What? You're crazy. Nah. Forget it. I know nothing about karate. I know Quino in action, he's good. Damn good. You should that, you know, I've seen Quino in action. He's good. Damn, he's good. You should tell your gods to send you someone else. You know, I can do whatever you want me to, but not this. You can't ask me this. You are just frightened. Yeah, you're right. Yes, you can bet on it. It is normal. I too was frightened when I was a boy. My father cured me of that by teaching me the martial arts. My father taught me just English lit. I'll take care of that, if you want. It is easy. Remember. The secret is wanting things, not knowing how to do them. Ah, to me, Quino is unbeatable. - Quino has no soul and no feelings in the things he does. He is very good. The finest. But he has no soul. And so, he can be beaten. - Well, what makes you feel, think that I have a soul? You have soul. We start tomorrow. Wait! Wait. I didn't say yes, okay? Wait. Your voice didn't, but you heart did. I heard the voice of your heart. Now, you sleep. Hi. Any news? So, the shopkeepers here have decided they do not need protection. The troublemaker told the others not to pay. Maria's father. Ah! Give him a lesson. Make him understand, without this protection, his store is finished. His and the others', too. Do it quickly and make it a good example. Understand? - All right. It must be very clear. How, I leave up to you. My boys are around, if you need them. I hear you are competing in the tournament again this year. Doesn't it bore you to win all the time? The prize this year is $2,000. Mm, $2,000, not bad. Maybe I will start training. Perhaps I will be the one to beat you. I wouldn't, if I were you. Listen to me, Antony Scott. I will teach you something I have taught no one. You can hit an opponent with your muscles. This is normal. But also, you can strike with your own vital energy. This is only possible if you have a pure soul. The secret is in concentration. If you concentrate correctly, your mind will absorb all your vital energy and push it along your arm when you strike. Not the fist that strikes, but energy that comes from the fist. Now I'll show you, if you concentrate, hold this. You Americans. - How did you do that? - It is not difficult. One day, perhaps, you too will also master the Dragon Blow. The Dragon Blow? Well, that's the most incredible thing I've ever seen. It's not a trick, is it? You Americans, such non-believers. Come on. - Uh, where are we going now? - Don't ask questions. Just concentrate. No questions! Yeah, but on what, huh? Now, Antony, that is enough! You come with me. I've seen people fish this way. I've always wondered how they did it. I could never do that. It's not difficult. You must concentrate on the inner-force. Your arm will do the rest. Like this. Now, you catch fish. How? You must be as good as you can. Great. Whoa-ho, I caught it! Pretty good, huh? You caught one fish. There are two of us. Within the forest, you are allowed no error. With the enemy, you are allowed no error. The hand must be as quick and as cool as the mind. The strength of a crazed tiger matters not. A warrior must read the heart of his enemy. A fool shows courage as a peacock shows feathers. Death wants no challenge, but only respect. Quino will kill you, if he can. He will be more rapid than an arrow. He will be more insidious than your pride. Kimura has taught you to understand the voice of the animal, the plant and the river, the voice of he who is born, and he who has never been born. Kimura has taught you to see the blow of the enemy with the eyes of the mind and to see the enemy with the eyes of he who does not see. Kimura has instructed you in all the secrets of his art. You must find the courage of the tiger within yourself. But most of all, Kimura has taught you to be a man. This kimono has been five generations in my family. They have fought with honor. I couldn't give you a medal, sol, I give this to you. Wear it with pride. - Really? - And honor. It's for me? You met Maestro Kimura? Yes. He's fantastic. He has his own way of making things easier. He taught me a whole bunch of things, a whole lot. - A lot of people here haven't even seen him. What's happening? What? It's a fire. That's where I live! My little brother's in the house! My brother, he's in the house! - Okay, okay. I'll go get him, okay? Wait. Hey, are you crazy? Get back! Come on, let's go! Get that ladder, get those hoses down, move it, move it! Come on, kid, let's go. Are you okay, Antony? Yeah, I'm fine. Terrific. - Paul, did you know I had a hero for a son? Where are you going? - Back to the typewriter. The mob did this and I'm gonna write about it. - I thought certain things didn't interest you anymore. - Maybe it's time to come back to the States and show you how wrong you really are. Quino's gonna be up next. Now Quino's up. Ladies and gentlemen! We have the conclusion of the tournament. Quino, who has been champion for the last five years, wishes to confront the four semi-finalists, together! It will be the most, spectacular event of all time! Are you ready? Bow. Fight! That's Quino. He's the one with the black kimono. If there's no one to confront Quino, I shall declare him the winner! Hold it! What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? Antony, he'll kill you! I'll be okay. - You are not going up there without my permission. I have to, Ma. Let him go, Julia. Everything's okay. It's fine. - Okay. He knows what he's doing. Thank you, Dad. Let's gm! Ladies and gentlemen! Fight! I'll kill you! For you, it is finished. - Stop it, stop it! - Stop, no, no, no! Sit down, sit down! Kimura? You were too confident. You saw the victory, not his blow. You have lost, Antony Scott. Not yet, not yet. - But you cannot see, your eyes are a mess. I can see through my mind now. Come on. You can do more. Now, you can use the Dragon Blow. It was nothing. It was bound to happen. Ladies and gentlemen! Antony Scott is the winner! The winner! The winner! ' Yes! I've gotta go. I know. I'm gonna really miss you. - What is it? - It's my... The $2,000 prize money. What am I supposed to do with it? - If you don't know, let's buy a ticket to the States. Okay, let's go. Let's go. - Well, Maria, here are the keys to my house. We're a team now, you're part of us, we're a family. And this way, you'll never be hassled again. And this includes your family, too. Thanks, thanks. I'll be back. I'll be back! - Kimura has taught you to understand the voice of animal, plant and river. The voice of he who is born, and he who has never been born. But most of all, he has taught you to be a man.
