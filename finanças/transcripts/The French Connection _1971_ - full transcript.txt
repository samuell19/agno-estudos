Get that hair done before Saturday. We're going now. Good-bye. [Cloudy] Move ass. Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour. All that is great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not out there in Ridgewood. Why don't you detach us then, for Christ's sakes? Give us a shot at it. At least till we find out if there's anything here or not. Everybody wants Weinstock, right? Well, maybe here's the lead we're looking for. We deserve this. You couldn't burn a three-time loser... with this garbage you're bringing in here. The man has done absolutely nothing. The first thing you know, you'll wind up in an entrapment rap-the both of you. Brooklyn is loaded with guys... that own candy stores, two cars, and like to go to nightclubs. Yeah, but you put this little candy store hustler together... with Joel Weinstock, and maybe we got a big score. Big score, my ass. At best he's selling nickel and dime bags. I wouldn't be infringing on your coffee break, Simonson... if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer. Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle. Or have you forgotten about that already? Jesus Christ, Jimmy. What's happened to you guys lately? Every year you lead the Narcotics Bureau in arrests. What was it, over a hundred again last year? Terrific. But who? What did you bring in? A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch. Oh, Christ. You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock. Walt, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right? It's like a goddamn desert full of junkies out there. - Everybody waiting to get well. - Goddamn it. This could be it. This little candy store guy... He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known narcotics connections. They were all over him. And then, on our own, after working a whole day and night... we tail him to Brooklyn, and we sat on him for practically a week. Now, who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake. Now, you gotta let us have it. Do you believe all this crap? I go with my partner. - What'll it take? - A wire. - No. Two wires. - Two wires. One on the store, one on the house. You know I have to get a court order for a wiretap, don't you? But you'll try. We know you can do it, Walt. [Chuckles] Popeye. You still pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie? [Chuckles] [Man Speaking French] [Ship's Horn Blows In Distance] [Chattering] [Woman] Mr. Devereaux, is this your first trip to New York? Uh, yes. It's my first trip. Why did you choose to come by ship? The next several weeks will be very difficult for me... and, uh, the middle of the ocean is the only place... where the telephone isn't ringing all the time. Mr. Devereaux, do you agree with the recent survey finding... that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world? [Man Speaking French] - [Chuckles] - To les femmes. [Man On P.A., Indistinct] Here's the rest of the warrants. The court order's in there for the wiretaps. Judge gave you 60 days on it. Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein will sit in for the feds. They'll make all the buys. Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down. You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill? Yeah, I know Popeye. His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop. Hey, look. If this is the way you're comin' in on this... why don't you stay home and save us all a lot of grief? - 'Cause that's my opinion. - Shove it up your ass. Whatever. Bill, look. Please... Do me a favor. Give them a chance. He came in here with a little basic information. I know you worked with him before. You had a little trouble. - But don't get off on the wrong foot, huh? - I'm not getting off... If you have any problems, come to me with 'em. Just keep him off my back. - Just try and cool it with him. - I will. If you have any problems, come to me. I'll handle him. Do me a favor. I'll be happy to work with him, believe me.

Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop. Hey! Hold-Hold on! Hold on! Break it up, both of you! Will you two break it up? Stop it now. Hold on to yourself! What's the matter with you? - Son of a- - Jimmy, you wasted two months on this. No collars are comin' in while you two guys are runnin' around town, jerkin' off. Now, go back to work! You're off special assignment! [Man On Radio] 10-4. [Bell Dinging] [Child] Oh, there he is! [Gunshots] - Oh! Oh! - [Screaming] - [Screaming] - Get down! Get down. Get out of the area! Leave her alone! Get away! Leave her alone! There's a sniper up there! [Children Crying] [Crying Continues] [Woman Screaming] [People Chattering] [Man] Somebody should call the doctor. [Speaking Spanish] [Man] Hey, there's a doctor right across the street. - [Man ♪2] There must be a doctor. - [Man ♪3] There is one. [Chattering Continues] [Panting] [Train Approaching] [Train Whistle Blows] Hey! - [Brakes Screeching] - Hey! Stop that man! He's wanted by the police! [Horn Beeps] - What's the next stop into the city? - 25th Avenue. Hold it! [Tires Screech] Police emergency! I need your car. I need your car. - [Horn Honking] - When am I gonna get it back? [Horn Honking] For Christ's sake! [Horn Honks] [Horn Honking] [Horns Honking] Hold it! Stop! Halt! - [Grunts] - [Screaming] [Screaming Continues] [Horn Honking] - [Tires Squealing] - [Horn Honking] [Honking Continues] - Don't stop. Don't stop, or I'll kill you! - Hey, what? What- I gotta stop in the next station. Touch the brake, and I'll blow you in half. [Horn Honking Continues] [Tires Screeching] [Train Whistle Blows] - What's going on? - I don't know. Sit down, buddy. Relax. Coke! Coke, you all right? [Horn Honking] Hey, Coke. You all right? - [Pounding] - Don't answer. [Honking Continues] [Mouths Words] Hey, Coke. You all right? - [Woman Screams] - Get back! - Relax. Now, put your gun down. - Keep going! [Woman] Oh, my God! [Screams] You're not gonna get away with this. Put the gun down. - Get back! - Come on now- - I said get back! - You can't get away... [Women Screaming] Stop! [Screaming] [Horn Honking] Hold it! [Man] Let's get out of here! [Man Shouting] Come on! Come on! Shake your ass. It's getting cold. I can't seem to find the damn ticket. - Where's the guy? - He's getting my car from the back. [Horn Honks] - Thank you. - Sure. - Can I help you? - Uh, yeah. Uh-It's a convertible. Do you have the ticket? The top one. The top floor? - What kind of ticket do you have? - Never mind. He's in the brown Lincoln, foreign plates. All right. He's walking towards Front Street. [Klein On Radio] Got him. Angie's parked over here in the LTD. [Russo On Radio] Cute. You stay with her. We're gonna sit on the Lincoln. That car's dirty, Cloudy. We're gonna sit here all night if we have to. [Shouting] [Vehicle Approaching] [Horn Honks] What time is it? Ten after 4:00. - Huh? - Ten after 4:00. That's the third time those guys have been around. - All right. Let's hit 'em! Hit 'em! - [Siren Wailing] Freeze! All right. Nobody move! Put your hands in the air! [Sirens Continue] Get over... Get over there! Hey! Get up there! Spread those fucking legs! Now stay right there! You move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off! - What the hell's that? - What are you doing? Turn around! - Man, I have my rights. - What do you mean, your rights? Who's the boss here, huh? Hey, who's running this outfit? - I am. - You are? What are you doing here? Who sent you down? Just runnin' around. Don't talk back to me, man. What are you doing here? - We saw the car, man. - You heist this car? No. We was breaking down the tires. That's all it was. Lock 'em up. Lock 'em up. Lock 'em up. - All of you, come on. - Come on! Come on! Come on. Stop draggin' your ass. Keep your hands on your head. You dumb spics, get outta here! Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key! [Police Radio Chatter] Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves. Nothin' in there except a New York City map. Are you bullshittin' me? [Grunts] That car's dirty. Take it in and tear it apart. [Jimmy] Tear it right out. Tear it out! Nothing here, Jimmy. Look in here. [Coughing] This is all solid. [Loud Hissing] [Tire Bouncing] [Whirring] There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory. That thing is clean. I don't buy that, Irv. The stuff is in that car. Well, you find it. I can't. [Indistinct] [Speaking French] Look, the car was lost some time last night. First, they send us to Pier 1, then they send us here. Then what? I don't understand why you parked the car down by the waterfront. You tell me you're staying at the Doral in midtown Manhattan... and you lose the car out by the Brooklyn Bridge? Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television. He probably left the car to look at some point of interest. We were told by the police commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage. I demand its immediate return. You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux. We get 400, 500 cars here a day. Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of this country. He's working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government. Here are his credentials from the French consulate. Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film... I suggest you locate the car immediately. You're in a no-smoking area, sir. Will you please extinguish your cigarettes? What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv? 4,795 pounds. You sure? That's what it was... 4,795 pounds... when it came into the shop. The owner's manual says 4,675. It's 120 pounds overweight. And when it was booked into Marseille, it was 4,795. That's still 120 pounds overweight. Jimmy's gotta be right. Listen, I ripped everything out of there except the rocker panels. Come on, Irv! What the hell is that? Uh-huh. Well, shit! Son of a bitch. All right. [Chuckles] [Arguing In French] It isn't the only car we have here. Got it for you, Randy. It just came in from downtown. - Who's Devereaux? - I am Mr. Devereaux. Why? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux... but we get a lot of cars here at night, and sometimes it's hard to keep track... - You mean the car is here now? - Oh, yeah, yeah. It's right outside. They, uh, stole it right off the street from you, huh? Goddamn. You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know. I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it. Well, that's New York. Is this your first trip over here? - Yeah. Where's my car, please? - It's right over here. Oh. But you're lucky this time. It's in perfect shape. Not a scratch. You must lead a charming life. [Chattering] [Indistinct Dialogue] Henri. Je vous attendais. [Speaking French] [Metal Clanging] [Chattering] [Engine Starts] - [Man] Let's go! - Bon voyage. Merci. - I would give you a ride, but- - [Engine Revving] - [Inaudible Dialogue] - Tom, take care. [Sal] Take care, baby. [Sal] Lou! - [Laughs] Yea! - [Shouting] [Laughing] Listen. I'll see you at Pop's tonight, huh? Okay, babe. Take care, huh? - [Radio Chatter] - [Tires Screech] [Radio Chatter Continues] - [Tires Screeching] - [Sirens Wailing] - [Chattering] - We made a good strike, huh? [Tires Screeching] What happened with Sal? What's the matter with him? They got the bridge blocked off! [Shouting] [Sirens Approaching] Let me in! Open the door. [Sirens Wailing Loudly] This is the police! You're surrounded! Come out with your hands up! This is the police! You're surrounded! [Door Bangs] [Door Hinges Creaking] [Gunshots] Bring out the gas! Hold your fire! [Gunshots Continue] Stop! - [Rifle Cocks] - Stop! We're coming out! Hold your fire! - Drop the guns! - [Coughing] Over here! Move it. Let's go! [Cloudy] Popeye? It's me! It's me! Frog One is in that room. Drop it! Mulderig. - You shot Mulderig. - [Panting] The son of a bitch is here. I saw him. I'm gonna get him. [Gunshot]
