St. Germain des Prés is the section that surrounds the oldest church in Paris, originally an 11th century abbey. The Institute of France and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts testify to its artistic vocation. More than a place, St. Germain is an intellectual climate "SCHOOL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE" and a modern way of life in an ancient and provincial setting. Its charm attracts... American students in love with old Europe. With its art galleries, its antique shops, it's wrought iron balconies, its narrow picturesque streets like the rue du Dragon. "ACADEMIE JULIAN" On the Blvd. St. Germain, the only wound left by Haussman, the café de Flore, where last night, at this terrace, a young American student, at this table, noticed her neighbor, and after much hesitation... asked him for a light. An hour later, Catherine and Jean got up got into a grey Bentley and slowly drove away through the noisy crowd of night owls on the Rue St. Benoit. They drove along the Rue de l'Abbaye... The night is soft and warm. Catherine has closed her eyes, she's put her head on Jean's shoulder. She abandons herself to a fate which she hopes is dangerous, and doesn't scare her as much as her parents would have liked. They had however, warned her that Paris is not a place for young Americans. But they are too far away, and it is too late. Desire overcomes reason. Tonight Catherine will not return to her hotel room across from the School of Political Science. However, she hesitates one last time, then suddenly, gets out of the car. She enters the building next to the Institute. She will go to bed with this handsome boy, even though they've just met. They wake up. It's 10 A.M. Ten o'clock! When does the plane from Mexico arrive? Twelve fifteen...Thank you. I'll barely make it. What am I going to do with her? I'll have to get rid of her. Too bad, she's nice. Ten fifteen. I have to be at Orly at noon. An hour to get there. The time to clean up... Take her home. That leaves me half an hour. I'd better hurry. It's faster this way. I fixed your breakfast. Come on Catherine, it's late. Hurry up, your coffee will get cold. Some other time. Then give me a robe. Why? We're alone. Please. Alright. Americans are such prudes. Here's your robe. She's relaxing too much. Thank you. You'd make a wonderful American husband. Eat! In America, I had a friend who lost her appetite every time she fell in love. I've never been in love. You don't like this? What a lovely view. You have a beautiful apartment! It'll be tough. She doesn't understand. Damn! She looks like she wants to stay. Aren't you ready yet? Look, Catherine, we have to go! My school. Leave me the keys? You're coming right back? Yes, in three weeks. I have to go to Mexico. I'm leaving in an hour. Thank you for telling me. I couldn't have said, "Come with me I'm leaving tomorrow." It would have been nicer. Would you have come? There you are. Answer me! Are you angry? I'm going to stay with my father. I told you last night, he's at the embassy in Mexico. Three weeks isn't long! Mexico isn't Peru. Why didn't you tell me? You wouldn't have come. You think I'm a tramp. Don't be silly. Yesterday I didn't know you and I liked you. Be reasonable. I like you a lot, you know. Wait, I'll make the bed. Yes, and you'll unfold it for the next one. Tonight, I'll sleep on the plane. I'm coming to the airport. No. I hate good-byes. Don't worry. I won't make a scene. Anyway, you can't. Do you want me to take you home? You travel without luggage. - It's all there. Of course, it's so natural. But Catherine we had a good time last night. Give me your address. The next day, at five o'clock, Catherine goes to the Académie Julian. Can I help you? Is this your first time here? It's not a place for nice American girls. You shouldn't stay indoors in such beautiful weather. It's much nicer in the country. Let's go. I have my car. Do you have sketching today? Every day. It has started already. Go right up. How do I pay? You pay the teacher. I'm going too. I can't let you go by yourself. You really want to go? Alright, let's go. Follow me, I'll get you a seat in the front. Glasses, sexy. You'll wear them in the country. Your sketch pad! I told you it would be awful. You're very pale. Come to the country. You'll feel better. Come on. I have my car. Is this your car? Where are we going? To your place. That was easy. Here we are. It's very nice here. Perfect to bring girls to. It's too hot in the summer. Is this your apartment? Yes, so is the car. What do your parents do? Not much, they're ambassadors. In Mexico, I presume. How do you know? You're the type. I look pale. What was I saying. Let's get away. Have you ever been to Mexico? I just got back yesterday. And when are you going back? In three weeks, why? And school? It can wait. Are you studying Political Science? Of course. My father, you know. How do you know all this? Have you been in France long? Two weeks. Where did you learn French? In the United States. I've lived in France for 22 years, and I still can't speak English. Have you always lived here? No, but whenever I'm with my father... I take out this subway ticket... and take the next plane to Paris. I understand. With an apartment like this, one wouldn't want to be elsewhere. Where? That dome. It's by Le Vau, isn't it? Do you think so? I'm sure. I'm impressed. Do you like old things? This will interest you. Genuine Early American. Want to look around? Thank you. I already have. That's right. I forget you know everything. Now that you've seen it, let's go to the country. I don't understand. It's much nicer there. I don't understand why you paint. You really don't understand. Because of the girls. I think it's disgusting! You're exagerating a bit. How shameless to be naked like that, in front of people. You've never seen me naked, that I know. I beg your pardon. Would it bother you? Do you know many models? It's possible. I must know some. One meets so many people here. And the guy who was posing? He's a poor devil. Is that all he does? He claims to be an actor. Is he your friend? Let's not exagerate. He's a poor guy, charming however. I help him out. When I leave, I lend him my apartment and car. It makes him happy. He pretends to be me. It's amusing. It must be horrible for him. Yes, life is hard. Say, you seem to like him. Are you crazy? Well, here we go again. Don't you get hot moving like that? That's very practical. That's the way it is. Bring a girl up, pull the bed down. How about the country? It's hot here. Take your scarf off. - Never in front of girls. Where are you going? - To Mexico. Oh, she's a bore. It's really too hot. That racket! - What racket? The construction site. They've started. The work! When do you think they'll be done? Does it matter? Do you realize that when the building is finished, we won't have a view. How do you know it'll be as high as our window? Look at that crane! Do you think they'd have such a big one. It'll be at least twelve stories high. Are my eggs ready? We'll have to keep the shades down. Overcooked! You know I don't like them hard-boiled. What's wrong with you this morning? Didn't you sleep well? Very well, and you? The trucks woke me up at 4. I couldn't go back to sleep. I didn't hear anything. You never do. You're so insensitive You wouldn't mind living in a rabbit hutch! We won't be able to breathe here when it's finished. A great deal, your apartment! Superb view of the Sacré Coeur and the Eiffel Tower. They're taking that view away. Think of all we could have done with the money! We could have bought a car, taken a trip... Stop dunking your bread, you're not a child. I don't understand. You were so happy when we moved in. We finally had something of our own. We could move out of your parents' house. And it's practical. You're near your office and I have easy transportation. Obviously, I couldn't know about the building. There are two kinds of men, winners and losers. I rather be cheated than cheat others. That's all very well if you're single. Do you ever think of me? Do people point at you in the street? Are you badly dressed? Don't be silly! Anyway, the status of the Gare du Nord... Don't clear your throat like that. It irritates me. I'd love to travel. Not to Tahiti, or even Greece... I don't know...Club Med... No worries... just travelling. Take a jet... You know, the voice at the airport. "All passengers for Teheran, "Air France Flight 342 "Immediate departure gate 3." But you don't want to travel anymore. Four years ago, you were the handsomest boy on the beach. Water skiing champion, scuba diving instructor... What happened to my hero? I don't look that bad. You've gained 22 pounds. You look like Churchill. Don't make those noises, it's vulgar! You only think about eating now. I never refuse a good meal. Are there any cornflakes? You've eaten enough. Go shave, you'll be late. I'm always put down. Move over! The worst thing about marriage is that one is never alone. You've lost your mystery. When I first met you I could imagine anything. Now, I know all your qualities and faults... I always know what you'll do. Can there be love when the mystery is gone? I don't understand you. It's the opposite for me. The more I know you, the more I love you. Even your little faults. If you thought a little instead of believing what you read, instead of dreaming of Greece and Tahiti... Really, if you thought about it, you'd see you're a lucky girl. Of course, we'll never be billionaires, but... we can be happy without that. If you don't like it here, we can move. The main thing is to be together. Stop it. I don't like that. At times, I think you only want my body. You could be more subtle. Let go. I hate being late for work. Even if you don't mind. Not that I love my job. But I don't want to be scolded by my boss. Every morning it's the same thing. I'm sick of it. Gulping down my breakfast, running to work. The thing I hate the most is... to be afraid of that pen pusher. When I think that's all you aspire to! Being head clerk. It's not that bad. Then we'll be able to afford a better place. We'll have a car and we'll travel. What good will it do us then? We'll be forty. Once again, you don't realize that you've been had. Jean-Pierre, you're a nobody! I've had enough of this. Shit! It's unbelievable. Poor little idiot, just because you're pretty... Thousands like you are walking the streets. Go join them! - Don't touch me. I should have known what you were, vulgar, conceited... Don't expect me tonight. You brute! Listen, I didn't touch you. You almost did. I'll never forget what you said. Listen, Odile. Don't be ridiculous! Listen, this is silly. Silly? Look at the view. In six months it'll be like a tunnel here. That's not my fault. This neighborhood! To think that some people live in Auteuil. Listen! When will I see you? Stop! Come back, Odile. Sorry, did I hurt you? No, you scared me. I didn't see you. My mind was elsewhere. I can't let you go like this. Let me drive you. No thank you. I'm not going far. I need to be alone. I'd like to be alone too, but I can't. It's up to you. I don't feel like it any more. What a strange neighborhood! It's my first time here. Where do you live? - Auteuil. In an apartment? No, an old house with a garden. It's too peaceful. You don't like peace. I saw the way you drive. Is that an Italian car? You left it in the street! It doesn't matter. Aren't you going to work? I never liked working. It has happened to me, of course, but it's so easy to make money. But how? You know the law of the jungle? I decided to eat rather than be eaten. But that's unfair! Life is unfair! There are poor people, ugly people. It's unfair. For example, you're beautiful. That's unfair to others. I never thought of it. There's even more to it. There's a balance which makes the lucky ones not know it or be able to profit from it. The strong get bored eating the weak. I wouldn't get bored and I'd take advantage of it. Do you profit from your beauty? Beauty must be shared with others. If we hadn't met... Nothing's changed. You almost ran me over, that's all. It's more important than you think. - Why? There are moments when a chance meeting could be a sign of fate. What sign? What fate? It's a beautiful day. Let's take the car and get away from it all. Or let's go to the airport. You know the carressing voices at the airport? We'll take the first plane. Haven't you ever felt like leaving for an unknown place? With someone you've just met? It's sad but we always run away from those we know best. Love dies from the lack of mystery. But, this mystery, can one preserve it? If I were to go with you... in a week, or a month, you would no longer be the mysterious man, or I the unknown woman. Have you ever seen a bullfight? It always seems to be the same bull and man but one dies. It's the same unending game... with players who are different, yet always so similar. I don't understand. It's difficult to explain. When a man meets a woman... It's always the same game. But one doesn't have to die. Are you afraid of death? - Like everybody. Do you love life, mystery? So come with me. We'll be stronger than death. I am anybody, I do anything, and I go anywhere. It's very tempting, you're very tempting. But it's impossible. I can't. I'll tell you the truth. I've been thinking of Death for a long time. This morning I decided to die. Then I met you. You are my last chance. I thought nothing could interest me anymore. Then I saw your smile. I'm not blackmailing you... but if you'd come with me... on an unknown adventure, anything is possible. Do you accept? Say yes. No, I can't. I can't. Everything's possible. I'll count to ten. Say yes. No. What a pity! No, you're crazy! You're crazy! You're crazy! It's impossible. I can't believe it. Do you think I'm going to strip in this cold? It's winter in here. Well, come here. This isn't your first time, is it? - No. What a job! Should I turn on the radio? Sure, we can do it to music. 30 francs...not expensive. Make a little effort. Sit down. We're in no hurry. I never go home with a customer. It's too dangerous. You're different. I'm not afraid of you. My legs aren't tanned... I couldn't go to Cannes, this year. My girlfriend got sick, so she rented her apartment. Did you go on holiday? I went to my aunt's in Limoges. The city were they make porcelain! Wow! It's not bad. What is there besides porcelain? I wouldn't know, I was in the suburbs. Only you would go to Limoges on a holiday. It's no joke when it rains in the country. It doesn't rain often in Limoges. You're not in a hurry, are you? All in good time. One day, we left for the Riviera... with some friends. Who? - Friends. We never got there. We had an accident. The others went to the hospital. I went back to Limoges. When I got there, my aunt had left with some guy. I came back to Paris. And then? Is that all? Yes, that's all. Your stories aren't funny. Meanwhile, I'm wasting time. Let's go. What if we ate first? I'm hungry. I'm sick of cheap restaurants. I'm sick of Paris too. It's a rotten city. I'd like to go work on the Riviera. What do you think? I don't know the Riviera. I already told you I had an accident and went back to Limoges. Anything to leave the Rue St. Denis. It makes me sick to think of it. What do you do? I'm a dishwasher, at Smitts, near here. Dishwasher? You don't look like one, Léon. What do I look like? I don't know, but not a dishwasher. May I try? You should exercise more. You don't have much muscle. How can you do your work? Dishwashing is different. I heard a riddle on the radio yesterday. Want to hear it? Why not. What's the difference between Bécon and Florence? I don't know. Well...in Bécon...uh... In Bécon... Well... Bécon is different from Florence. How funny. I'll tell you why. In Bécon there are girls named Florence. In Florence there are no girls named Bécon. Hey, sweetie. We're forgetting why I'm here. I'm in no hurry. True, tomorrow's Sunday. My day off is Tuesday, not Sunday. Cottage cheese? It reminds me of my youth. My father had hay fever. He came to Paris to see a doctor. The guy robbed him. I remember the station St. Lazare... 3 hours to get to the doctor's. My father was furious. I was happy. He went home sick and broke. The charm of the countryside... what a bore. I like it, the countryside. Do you have a girl? No... Ever thought of marrying? Never. A little wife, slippers, a warm bed... What do you say? Nothing. I like you, baby. You're broke, I'll pay for my dinner. Do you mind? You never say no. Do you like me or not? If not, I can always leave. Don't go. Alright, I'll undress and... Don't you want coffee? You'll get your money, don't worry. Here's five francs for dinner. No problem. I pay for my food. I don't want your money. Let's not fight about it. Have a paper? "France-Soir" Sorry, but just a glance at the news, for fun. "Hold-up goes wrong". So it doesn't always work. "Mystical madness at St. Nazaire." There're nuts everywhere. "Racing horses stolen in Paris" Funny. Yes, very funny. Well, how about it? Darn, a short circuit. Do you want to wait? Oh, darkness never bothered me. In the center, the Arch of Triumph. Built from 1806 to 1836, in memory of Napoleon's victories. It is visited every day, by tourists from all over the world. On the other hand, Parisians never go near it... Except for veterans, whose task is to keep the flame burning... and the President of the Republic. When these functions are over, it is only the intersection of twelve wide avenues, a no man's land ignored by the working population. These hurried people, disdainful of the prestige of the place, only know its outskirts. Every 1/12 of the circle, that is, approximately every 50 yards, there is another avenue to cross. The stop lights are timed for the traffic, and not for the pedestrians. This creates constant trouble more or less bothersome, depending on the age and the personality. Parisian individualism, is well tested. One last point, in 1964, work started on the west side on a subway, which doesn't help traffic either automobile or pedestrian. And here is our hero, Jean-Marc. Every morning at 9:25, he comes out of the subway station almost directly across from his work. To get there, he has two choices. Going right is slightly shorter. Would you like to see another style? In your size... we have this one... or this if your prefer. No thank you, I'll think about it. As you wish. Once a professional runner, Jean-Marc reads a sports paper every morning. Did you watch the women skiers? I don't have a T.V. Too bad! It's exciting to see them go 60 miles an hour. How I admire them! You know how hard it is when you try. Have you skiied? Ten years ago, I tried a little with two boards on my feet... You need such balance... and extraordinary strength to stand up on those boards. I beg your pardon. It's nothing. Did I hurt you? Are you sure? Excuse me, sir. - Watch where you're going. I'm sorry. You're crazy! May I help you? Pyjamas. What size? I don't know. Alright, we'll see. There was nothing in the papers that day or the next. DRIVER HIT WITH WHIP THE CRIME OF THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES MANIAC IN THE SUBWAY ROLLS CHAUFFEUR DIES IN FIGHT STUDENT IN LYONS HURT POLICEMAN WITH UMBRELLA A LETHAL WEAPON: THE UMBRELLA But, he was still careful not to go near the Pl. de l'Etoile. Yes sir, white poplin, 42 Avenue de Wagram. I'll have it delivered right away. Ten minutes. It's right across the square. One or two months had passed, when, finally... Watch your step! Excuse me madam, I'm sorry. It's nothing. Did I hurt you? Lucky! I could have poked your eye out. What are you doing? - I'm working. Is it a woman? Yes, it's the last one, you see, it's almost finished. It's a woman... Yes, if you like. Is this a hand? Why are there only 4 fingers? I had nothing to make the fifth with. I like the one outside. She's pretty! What do you call her? Action-sculpture. What's that? It means that chance enters into the creation of the sculpture. I take pieces of metal and I throw them... and I weld them together the way they fall. It's all very experimental. Don't you want to know why I am here? Yes, why are you here? You'd said 8 o'clock. Because I love you. Do you want some coffee? I have something to tell you. Do you love me? Yes, of course. Really, truly. Of course! Do you think I'm pretty? Yes. Really? I already told you. Do you really love me? Would you forgive me if I did something bad? Of course I'd forgive you. Why do you ask? Nothing important. How long does a telegram take to arrive? I don't know, about an hour, an hour and a half. What time is it? Listen. In 45 minutes, you'll receive one from me. But it's not for you. Who's it for? Someone else. A man? How do you know? I don't know, I suspect. Anyway, you don't know him. It doesn't matter. It does. I mixed up the envelopes. I put your letter in his... and his in yours. That can be fixed. He gives me mine, and I give him his and that's it. It's very serious because... in his letter I tell him I love him and make plans to see him tonight. But I just pretend to love him. And wanted to see him... to tell him that, and that I won't see him anymore. It's you I love. I swear. I wanted to tell him that tonight. I knew you'd forgive me. I don't understand. Who's the guy? If you want, we can go to bed now. I'm cold. You bitch! Disgusting! Tramp! Whore! Liar! But I swear I love you. I loved you because you were pure and beautiful. You make me sick. I swear I love you. Shut the door! It's shut. No it isn't. Are you working? Can't you see? Who does it belong to? The pope. The pope who? Pope Pauly VI. Do you know what makes a car? An automobile is made of many parts. First the chassis, then the wheels... and third the body. The body, that's my department. I obviously don't have the talent of Farina or Micheletti... but I do alright. In my own small way, I am an artist. Bodywork is sacred for me. Turn it off! It'll wear out. Everything in life does. Except the body. The body is eternal. Tell me, Roger, do you think I have a nice body? Perfect. What I really like is youth. Young breasts... young legs, everything that's beautiful. But, what are you doing here? I wanted to see you. We had a date at midnight. I thought I'd come see you this afternoon. You know I love you, Roger. Speak louder. I said I love you. I know that. I got your telegram. Are you mad at me? No, since you love me. Then you forgive me? That's wonderful! I slept with another man. You aren't mad. But you know, I mixed up the envelopes. I wrote this other boy that I love him... but I swear it's not true. It's just... He's nice. I knew him before you, and he still loves me... I don't know...He wanted to see me, so I made a date for tonight. But it was only to tell him I wouldn't see him again. I couldn't say all that in the letter. I didn't want to hurt him. I wanted to tell him that I love only you. I swear. You know it. If you like, we can go up now. We can go to bed now. It's almost dark. Come here, you tramp! Come here, you dirty low class whore, tease, bitch! What is it, Roger? I thought you'd forgiven me. "Dear Roger, I kiss you tenderly" Darn! I didn't make a mistake after all. Go to hell! My sweater. Get out, American! I'm Canadian. It's the same thing. I love you. I swear. Here's your son. Did it go well? I'm glad. How many times a week do you go? Three times? What does he do to you? I went to the doctor the other day. He had me tested. I don't have the results. I'm not feeling well. It's called Vitacalcium. Have you taken it? I'm constipated I use suppositories. What are they called? They give me the runs. You could knock! Come here. She was bringing me my tea. Did you work hard? Were you first in class? - Third. What were you last month? Sixth. So, it's better. Yes, a little bit. Good. One must make progress. Understood? Yes. What's hard for you? Algebra, still algebra! Why? I don't understand. Why? The parentheses, the a's, the b's, the minuses. All of it, I get mixed up. Do you want me to explain it? Sure, if you want to. Poor child! Come on. Listen, algebra is easy. A plus times a plus is a plus. A minus times a minus is a plus. A plus times a minus is... Is a minus. There. Alright. Not a word to the queen mother. - No, of course not. I am for capital punishment. I'm against it. Really now... What, really now? There's no reason to condemn... How can one judge others? Salt! They kill, they're killed. Killers must be killed. I think they should... They should be sent to reform schools. We should try... If they're 50, you can't send them to reform school. I said pass me the salt. Well then, maybe in certain cases, as an example... There I agree with you. Death to the traitors! Kidnapping children, now that's revolting. For that, the death penalty. They're given 20 years. What's the matter with you? Shut up! You do nothing anyways. What would be nice, would be that you help me get in... with our friend Boticelli. He's interesting, if you see what I mean... This veal is excellent. He should be careful with me, or I'll... I'll shoot him full of holes. This veal is really excellent. I always eat the way Italians do. Someone should explain to Boticelli... that there are some people in the world with guts... aspirations, ideals... He's got to understand that. Or I'll crush him like a worm. We almost ran over him. Not quite. That's true. The car behind us did. Others too. He had diplomat's plates. They just don't care. This cheese is very good. Black polynesians... Six letters, in the plural. I take care of the house! It's dusty in here. It's not my fault, it's the maid's. Always the maid! I'm not doing the dusting, with what I pay her. You always say it's the maid! I don't do the dusting! Idiot! That's easy to say. Leave me alone. One of these days, I really will. You'll see. Are you giving me the money? You'll have to manage. Unbelievable! You should exercise. I keep telling you you're getting a paunch. I have to have my medecine. Take your medicine. You know how much your medicine cost last week? Have your father's pharmacy send them. But, he's too stingy. My father's senile. I've really had enough, you know. I'm alone in the house. That's all we needed. You forgot to shut the window. I have something in my throat. "Form fitting ear plugs, "block vibrations... "and are perfectly sound-proof. "Noise, the price we pay for modern civilization... "is one of the main causes of nervous disease. "The sick and the nervous will now be able to sleep. "Intellectuals, to work in silence... "thanks to these ear plugs." ...But I put them in the same closet. "Factory workers... "and all those with jobs who are exposed to noise "machine operators, metal workers... exposed to repetitive noise... "which is damaging to the auditory nerve... "will protect their ear drums with ear plugs". No need to shout. You just wait and see... I'm getting fed up. I asked her for the sugar 10 times. The coffee is good. Really? I could make it as well. If it weren't the Holiday Season I'd have fired your little blonde. You hired her. You're late. Who's going to take care of the car? Brushing your teeth before work? That's new. It happens to be the maid's day off. That's enough. That doesn't mean anything. What do I do with the car? - That's enough! You make me so angry. Am I taking the car in or are you? I have other things to do. I'm tired of taking care of your business. It's not my problem, it's yours. I'll do it, but... Just shut up will you! Who's going to take care of the car? It's not complicated. You look stupid when you make those faces!
