POOR MILLIONAIRES Don Alvaro! Here you are! My passengers are waiting for me. A kiss for the brides. Not you. Salvatore, did you buy the tickets? - No, I didn't. - He didn't! Why are you crying? It's not a funeral. I'm crying because they're going. Yes, but for their honeymoon! You make me cry too, now! Four, 1° class to Florence. And a dog. It's our honeymoon, we got married this morning! The train is leaving. She's my wife! That's life! It was a mistake! I made the same mistake 20 years ago... Hi, Romolo. Leaving? Yes, going to Florence for business. With your secretary? No, this is Endimione. When you are back, you must introduce me to your girlfriend. Ok. - Who's that? - A friend. Why didn't you introduce me as Mrs Toccaceli? Mrs Toccaceli! You mean my wife? You must say "Mrs Toccaceli". I got the tickets. Wait, do you know who she is? "Mrs Toccaceli“ - Get a move! Have fun. Bye mom! Keep the tickets, or I'll lose them. - What are you looking at? - Why? Forgot anything? My hat! The train is leaving! Excuse me, is my hat there? The train is leaving! Quick. Let's sit here, it's all empty. Let's go in front, the girls must be worried. You are the usual jerk... we are on a parked carriage! Damn, all because of this hat! Did you take the vows? What do we do? We have to get off at the next stop. - What do we do? - Let's ask. We missed our train. What time is the next to Florence? Next is an Express. Which platform? This one, but it's gone! Run! Don't rip my jacket!! Fatso! - Lout. - Eat less! Tickets. They got them. - Where? - On the other train. We missed our train, our wives have the tickets. - I am sorry... - We are more. Is this an Express? Yes, there's an extra charge. As well! But, in this case we'll arrive first. For sure. They got off, the jerks! Did you hear what they said? Nothing. Endimione, shut up! Run! A taxi! What's the stop before this one? Oriolo Romano. To Oriolo Romano! My leg! Bad luck! Is anybody there? Are you sure they understood? They nodded. There they are! - Where're you going? - Florence! Those dimwits. What do we do now? We get a train to Florence. And my coat? Idiot. Madams, we are in Florence. Excuse me... What time is the next from Rome? A couple of hours. Why don't you wait here? This carriage ends here. The train from Rome will stop just opposite. I'm hungry. Don't you have a few cents for a sandwich? I told you we should keep the money... The comfits! Four each. They must be worried sick by now... Anything I expected... but to spend my honeymoon with you. Poor girls, all alone! Pass the wine. Still eating? He asked if I wanted seconds... They must be in Florence. If I think about Annamaria... I could cry... Ask for cheese. A plate of cheese for me too. What are you doing? Nothing. Good food in this restaurant car! Finally, Florence! And now? Endimione! A kiss! Another one! The suitcases! Where is this train going? Express to Rome. - No stops? - No. Back to Rome! Goodbye honeymoon! Finally, home. Wonderful honeymoon! I wish it never ended! What have you got in your suitcases? Look at it! Posh! Plants too! Marisa, how do like our home? My home, you mean. Remember, you and my sister... are just guests in mine and my wife's home. Mrs Toccaceli's... until you find a place of yours. Go pay the taxi. And the money? Scram! My own home, it's like a dream. But an upper floor was better. All the people and the street noise... The upper floor costs double, no? This is a quiet area, anyway. Shut the window, quick! But there are no windows! And the doors neither! Are you still working? Weren't you due next week? You could put in doors and windows at least. Talk to him. This is not good. About the doors and the windows... the firm went bust. The tenants did the job by themselves. Doors and windows are 300.000 lire, I told you. Who did you tell? Your friend. Now I understand! Another fine mess by your husband. They were quick. Nice and ready. Mommy's touch. Wrong number! Who was at the phone? Carlo! I asked who was at the phone. Are you nuts? It was her again! God, the suitcases! - Are you leaving? - Why? There are suitcases at the entrance. If you want me to leave, just tell me! I am leaving right now! What? No doors or windows? It's worse than the colosseum! There he is! He told me. I'll sort you out later! Here's 300.000 lire. That's our honeymoon money! Forget the honeymoon. We need the money for the house. After these, no more money. Ok? Not to me, give them to the manager tomorrow. Get the furniture, at least. - Where from? - The basement. Come, good news. Really? Come with me to the basement! Can't you go on your own? Take off your jacket. Who are you calling. Mom. I promised I'd call from Florence. So they all come over and see the mess we are into! Let's pretend we are calling from Florence. Interurban. Madam, call from Florence, connecting you now. Hallo, mom? We are all fine. It's a nice hotel overlooking Piazza Della Signoria. The line is noisy. What? If Romolo did his duty? Oh, mom! No, don't go to the new apartment. They are still working. Romolo and Salvatore are very happy! Watch it. No way we can get this out! Idiot! I was trying to carry it in! When are we are back? I said we are still in Florence. Saturday. Why did you say “OK”? Saturday they'll pick us up at station. You never get one right! The furniture is waiting. What did I say? Come see the room! - Do you like it? - Wonderful. Excuse us, can I have a word with my wife? Mrs Toccaceli... Are you nuts? Where's the double bed? Why? In America they all sleep in separate beds! - Are we Americans? - No. If I want to talk to you, do I use the phone? But it's the modern fashion. Listen... let's sleep the old fashion way. And we are supposed to sleep in this hole? Romolo said this is the guest room. And this is the guest room? Don't you like it? I thought this was the cupboard. We can just fit the bed. Why? Are you inviting anybody else? And how long are you planning to stay? Bombece is providing an accommodation to all his employees and I am the first in line. - What's Bombece? - My employer. Marisa, our bed! Salvatore, An express delivery for you. Ah, from Bombece! It's from Mr. Bombece in person. Good man, I'm like a son! “Dear Mr Meniconi. .. the following is to express our appreciation for your work during your probation period. So, it is with regret... that we have to let go of one of our best employees. Are they firing poor Baldaccini? Idiot, they just fired you! Me? ”One of our best employees ” It's you all right(!) There's more: ”Please collect your personal properties” ”Playing cards... exploding cigarettes... and a water pistol ”Best regards, Bombece”. I made a big mistake yesterday. What happened yesterday? Perhaps she refers to marrying an idiot with a water pistol! But if they fired you, we'll never get rid of you! I don't want to see him ever again! I can get you a job. But you have to sweat. What is it? My department store needs a porter. No, thanks. I can't work under you. - Why not? - I have my dignity! This pudding is revolting! Apologies. What brush is that? Can't you see it says “shoes”, you idiot? - Sir! - Coffee! Quick! How long are you going to humiliate him? Until he applies for the job. Wash the dishes, and careful! Enough of being the cleaning lady! I'd rather work as a porter! Oh, at last! Marisa, your beds! Marisa, you'll see! What's this? The beds you ordered. But these are for kids! You chose them from the catalog. What did I know they are for kids? Didn't you read the measures? 80 by 120 cm. And you said they were for twins. No, I said “twin beds”! Marisa, it's just a misunderstanding! I'll sort it out, ok? Don't touch me! I made up my mind, tomorrow I'm going to a lawyer. Right, to sue the shop if they don't change the beds. No, I want a divorce. Because of the beds? Salvatore, you made one too many! You didn't even give me a cheap ring for our engagement. Then the honeymoon. I would have slept on the floor, but with a different man. Another man? Who? We don't even understand each other. We need our freedom. It's for the best. I can't stand you anymore! - Is it your last decision? - Yes. Goodbye. - Ciao. - I'm leaving. About time! Be happy you and Annamaria. We will, now. Run after him! I don't run after anybody. But, he's got my jacket! With my 300.000 lira. Forget the money! He might even kill himself! With 300.000 lira in his pocket? He dashed in the first bar! Time to give him a good lesson! Oh, my suit! That jerk forgot to fit the back of the wardrobe! And they nicked my suit! Excuse me, does No. 60 stop here? No, they nicked that too! They run somebody over! I wish they run over someone I know... Are you hurt? God, I'm so confused! Did you have to tie your shoe in the middle of the road? Does it hurt? No, but I am dizzy. I can't even recognise you... Because we never met before. Miss, better take him home. Vittorio, help him! Still sore? No, but still dazed. Watch ! Where do you live? I can't remember! Do you remember your name, at least? Sure I do. What's my name? Look at yourself in the mirror. Are you scared to look? You are not bad, you know. Blonde... Brown eyes... Nice smile. Recognise yourself? I knew we would meet tonight. I almost run over somebody else. It was on the newspaper. Already? My horoscope. “Tedious day but... in the evening an incident will make you meet the man of your dreams ”. Are you sure you didn't hit your head too? Ah, I'm so lonely... We can spend tonight in a nightclub. But do you have any document? A comfit. You must come from a wedding, then. And what are these? Money! And I thought I was poor! I'm rich! If he spends a cent of my money... Romolo, Salvatore will be back. Who cares? I just want every cent back! Do you want to spend it all tonight? I don't want to keep a single cent! Did you separate the beds again? Romolo, do you mind sleeping in the lounge? Yes, I do! I can't leave Marisa alone... After this evening... And... us? Ok, you'll tell me when we can sleep together. We are young, we have all our life ahead! Are you hurt? I always dreamed of a honeymoon like this! You are hurt! No, ducky, I am not! May I... Watch the TV? It's not annoying you? And if you dream of Salvatore, say hi from me! Gotcha! A jacket like mine. And she says it's not an evening jacket! But that's Salvatore! - Where? - On TV. He's spending my money, the bastard! 10.000 for a packet of cigarettes? Go nuts, it's not your money! I knew there was another woman! Ouch! You know what I want! Bravo, go dance! My money! Put them away! You are looking for troubles! Is that the "Snick & Snack"? I'm going! Coming back? Nothing. Don't you even recall how to court a girl? You didn't tell me anything nice, yet. It's just that I don't even know who you are. If I tell you, we wouldn't be two people who meet and... forget the rest of the world. Like them. Do you like her? Look how close they dance. I would gladly court her. She is the prettiest. But she is engaged. Do you reckon she is in love? I'm afraid she is smitten. Why don't we go home? Miss... You forgot this... And your fur? It is last year's! They are the gentleman's. Here - Thanks, young man! But it was Salvatore! Chase that car! I still can't remember a thing. Do I live here? Actually it's my home. But from now on you can live here. I always dreamed of meeting a man... without any ties with the past... no memories. It's like you were a new born. You're nuts! You are like Adam to me. Adam? You are really nuts! I am. Come. Tell me you like me. How can I, so soon? Is this cool house all yours? Yes, darling! But tell me you like me. I adore you! What beautiful mouth! Is it on your name? I meant the house! Giovanni. This is my butler. Is the dog still up!? God, what a house! How many rooms are there? I don't even know! I never counted them. Giovanni, play Chopin. And who's that? Don't know. He comes for a bath all Thursdays. - Do you like Chopin? - Who? I wouldn't mind having a bite, I'm starving. What about an intimate dinner? Giovanni, dinner for two. Careful, it's a 1890 Bourgogne. Darling, the smoking suits you. I bit tight, whose suit was it? Please, darling... - What's this? - Soup, sir. I don't want it. Never mind, sir. Lobster. I don't like it. (Who bloody cares!) Chicken and peas. Is this all? Can't I have spaghetti? Darling, I am peckish. What did you say? Love, I'm starving! I'm starving! Miss Alice said to wake him up gently! Who are you? The butler, sir. The butler, I remember now. Is your memory back, sir? You were playing last night. What were you playing? Listen Chopin, yesterday you sent me hungry! But now fetch me some food, or I'll die! Breakfast. Who are you? The nanny. Listen... what's the name of that pretty girl? Miss Alice. Is she sleeping? Miss Alice is in a meeting. At the department store. Wasn't Romolo in honeymoon? He must have argued with the wife. Do you have a larger fridge? No, this is the largest. Could you deliver it yourself? For these jobs we have a handyman. The customer is always right. Up to a point. Weren't you in your honeymoon? I had troubles. Actually, about my holiday pay... I'll talk to the general director. The director died two days ago. They are electing the new one now. Miss, can we name the new general director? We are waiting. Do you agree on Doctor Basso? I found the ideal man. It's a role of responsibility... it requires financial skills. It requires a clear mind. A clear mind? He is like you say. Gentlemen, I found the new... general director. Look, the new general director! I got him, that moron! Are, you crazy? I'll make him eat his fur! Don't you know he's the director? He is a pal of mine. Brother-in-law, actually. Do you mind if I smash this on his head? You are fired! Calm down or you are fired. Compose yourself and smile. Here we have toys, appliances... Miss Mazzetti, one of our best employees. This one looks better... How old are you? - 18. You don't say. What's wrong with you? What a scene with the general director! That jerk, the general director! - I'm going crazy! Who's that elephant? A new one. What's his name? Romolo Toccaceli. I don't like his face. Remind me when it's time to sack someone. I go with my nose in these things. Shame on you! He's a customer. You cretin! I need a word with the director. He's busy now. Is the director still with Miss Alice? The doctor is with them. Do you think he's able to work? The mental faculties are fine. At the beginning, I was afraid he was retarded. But it's only amnesia. Wonderful! Doctor, will he remember one day? Who knows? He might never recover. And how do you feel? Since yesterday, wonderfully! Is it true the director lost his memory? I am the brother-in-law. Well, I'll be frank, then. It's not an easy case. If he met his wife or sister, would he recognise them? Absolutely to avoid! Remember, never upset the mental state of the patient. An emotional trauma could be fatal. Any attempt would be useless, anyway. Professor, you must help me! I am not a professor! A guy in Amsterdam recovered the memory after 30 years! I can't wait 30 years for my money! This is the villa of the department store's boss. They are lovers, then! I don't care about love. The meter here says 1000 lire. I want to know what's going on. I am going in. Are you crazy? The doctor said he could have an emotional “tram". There they are! I don't mind the drive-in... But I've already seen this movie. All the luck, this one! 3000 lire on the meter and I'm paying for his movie too! Watch the movie, not them! Romolo, turn up the volume. Would you kiss me? Turn on the headlights! Turn them off! I wonder what they are saying. Nothing, can't you see they're snogging? I have an idea! I'll connect our loudspeaker with their car's. That's my diploma in electronics to a good use! ”I wish to talk to Father Malachia” ”Malachia, Dorothy is here” ”I'll leave you alone” ”Dorothy, what brings you here?” I turn this on and we'll hear what they are saying. ”Darling, my love” ”now that we are alone, I can confess...” ”I never loved anybody like I love you”. That goody-goody! She told Nick “I love you”... and instead she's doing the priest! Cool movie! ”Instead of talking so much, kiss me ”. Smart these protestant priests! Be quiet! What's this, a church? ”Don't you think we are in a strange position?” And how! ”Don't worry, we'll get engaged. Aren't you happy?” ”I am very happy!” I can't listen any more. Lets listen to the movie, then. "Kid, in your interest I can only recommend prayer." What's up now? I don't get this film at all! Let's go, please! Don't you want to know how it ends? It‘ll end up very bad. Let's go! I'll sort him out, that idiot! Did you write that, miss? Yes, sir. “I received this morning your toy samples. Full stop." "And I must say that I am full... Another full stop? No, "full of disappointment". "Your arrows don't fly straight". Sir, you have visitors waiting. Let them wait! I am busy. Those tablets are useless, I have that headache again! I need a word with the director. We'll see if he won't receive me. "Best regards"... What do you want? Just one minute... It's about a personal issue. Should I go, sir? You are so kind and understanding... It's like I knew you for a long time. If you allow me... Cut short, young man! What is it? 300.000 lire. I don't understand. I need 300.000 lira. Mine is a sad story. A son of a bitch of a friend of mine... made a run with your money. You choose the wrong friends! Very wrong. This bastard even abandoned his wife on the honeymoon. Look, I can't help you. Look for your friend. You can go! Look at the family I have to support! You are abusing my patience. Look, please! You are all young, you will rebuild a life. Who is this black face? That's the bastard of my friend! REDUNDANCY LIST Marisa, don't cry! There's still hope. We are putting away his stuff, Like he is dead. These are his school marks... All 9! You are reading upside down, They are all 6! His water pistol... his slingshot... His cards. Wasn't his childhood stuff at his mother's? This is from his office. What's up Marisa? This is the suit he was wearing... the first time we went out. The flared trousers! If Salvatore sees you the way you were the first time, he might recognise you. I still remember. Salvatore told me everything. He said you made an impression. He said. “That potato got pretty!” Is this the dress? It'll be a bit tight now. It's not easy to find the perfect girl. Mine is a fantastic idea. A live shop window! A real girl instead of a mannequin. It's not easy to find the ideal girl. Do you know I long did I look for one? I am surprised you found a wife, with that face! We need a young girl, plain... But nice and attractive too. She must be a good cook... The ideal wife... Good evening. I've seen you before. Do you know where? In that shop window. When I had my idea... I imagined somebody like you. Funny, you are the one I was looking for. Pretty, down to earth. The next door girl. It's a good job, you know. Is that why you wanted to talk to me? She's the elephant's wife! He's sitting pretty, the jerk! Don't pretend to work! You are married, right? I want to help you. I have a job for your wife. What job? Good salary. Thanks, but what is it about? It's a job of responsibility. I'd rather discuss it with your wife. There is a misunderstanding. You are not the one I want. But my husband... Your husband... Keep an eye on him, madam! Now I understand why he's asking for money! Another woman! You are a liar! I saw him picking up the same woman every night. That's why I thought it was his wife. You are cuckolded! Who did you pick up last night after work? If you don't tell me, I'll smash everything! Nobody, I swear! Who was that woman? The night Salvatore told me about the shop window. The job. And you didn't tell me anything? Who cares about the job! That's not what I want! She came at 4... Went to bed and is sleeping for real. She forgot she is in a shop window. Vittorio, the “Maja desnuda“”. Are you crazy? What do you care, is she your wife? What a perfect wife! I need to talk to the girl in the window. Go in, it's a live window, no? Right! Have you lost your mind? Who's that? The ideal wife's friend! Pretend to be the ideal guest. Why have I lost my mind? You're showing your legs, messes up the chores, flirts! I chose you as the ideal wife. Me? - Yes! - I'm your wife? You are the ideal wife of our clients, everybody's wife! Everybody's wife? But I'm catholic, sir! Don't be funny! Don't be angry! Smile! Pretend you are the ideal husband. Coffee? Don't laugh, miss, please! What you laughing at? Blockhead! Rude! Where is the director? In the shop window. In the window? Darling, we are late! What were you doing? Nothing. Alice, I found the ideal wife. Thank you! Quick, the jeweler is waiting. This is our rarest piece. Alice why didn't you come on your own? Darling, it's just the thought! I want you to buy it. This is the renowned Anastasia‘s diadem. The best we have. 18 millions. But for you, 15. - Can you buy it for me? - Sure. Last price? In that case, pay! Thank you. Look this ring is a reproduction. How much is it worth? 5.000 lire. I didn't haggle on Anastasia... But this one, 3.000. Ok? Vittorio! Vittorio! Lend me 3000 lira. And not a word with Miss Alice. When my girlfriends will know you bought me Anastasia's diadem will be green with envy! No bull! You don't have to do that! I feel at home, now! I like good housewife like you. It's easy in a small house. It's harder with a lot of money... like you. You might not believe me... But I am not cut for this life. What life is that? High society... Business, luxury. .. It must be because I am born into money! - Yeah? - Well, yes! Perhaps that's why I crave a simpler life.. I'm even curious about being poor! I was looking at you in the window. I would enjoy having a small house... and a wife like you... uncomplicated, pretty... down to earth. I wish I met you earlier. I wasn't lucky! Well, I'm off. Good bye, sir. You promised you would let me take you home sometime. I would be happy if you liked me. And stopped calling me sir. It's because you intimidate me a bit! But even if you didn't like me, I'd be happy the same. Because it's wonderful to be in love... even when we are not loved back. I don't understand! I am courting you. I live here. Nice! Not as big as your house. These modern houses are all alike, eh? All the fault of my friend who lost him memory. Not my business. No windows until you pay! No windows? How is it possible? Didn't my brother tell you about his friend? The one who made a run with the money? What a scumbag! How can you sleep with no windows? You are better off... sleeping in the window. I'll let you have an advance. Thanks. Perhaps I had a bad opinion of you. But now that I know you better.. I am grateful. I have something for you. Just a cheap ring. Just a thought. Thanks. Marisa, soon or later... Salvatore will remember you. And you'll be happy again. But I am already happy. I have never been happier. I wish he never remembers anything. Not even me! Have you gone nuts? Salvatore doesn't remember me, but he still loves me. It means, whenever we had met... It would have been love. Isn't it wonderful? Wonderful(!) Can you do me a favour? Considering your deep connection with the general director... Can you ask him to raise my salary? If not, kindly tell him... I'll bash his head in! - I love you so much. - I do to. Tell me the truth! Was there anybody else before me? Why? I'm jealous. Of the past? To tell the truth, there was one. - Did you love him? - Yes. - More than me? - The same. Why are you angry now? How was him? A bit like you. But in a certain ways I didn't like him. Well done dumping him. He dumped me. He just left one day. What a scumbag! Do you know where he is now? I'd rather not talk about him! Why are asking about the past? Let's talk about the present. What's there between you and miss Alice? Are you engaged? Yes. If you want, I'll break the engagement tomorrow! - Do you promise? - I swear. I'd like to come to your place. Why? To meet your folks! Come tonight, I'll cook gnocchi. Gnocchi? Don't you like gnocchi anymore? I never liked gnocchi. Mom, you'll sit here. Salvatore between you and Marisa. That's the way it was all Sundays. Donna Cecilia, remember: When Salvatore arrives, don't hug him! He might have a fit! I'll have a fit. My poor son! I can't believe he doesn't recognise me. The mom is always the mom! Can't he feel the call of his blood? I can feel something is burning! The roast! God, Salvatore favorite plate! If he doesn't remember this one, he won't remember anybody! When he was a kid, mom used to tell him: "Eat it all, and you'll see Rome's football colors!“ Put it away, quick! What do I do? You just shut up! The bell! And you don't cry! You go dad, who can forget your face? - Romolo. - Don't get upset! Sorry, wrong door. Who was it? Salvatore. He said he got the wrong door. And you let him go? What a father... Director! Apologies, please come in. My Jacket! Nothing, please come in. - Here's mom. - Ah, the mom. My pleasure, madam. He called me "madam"! Why, what should I call her? Are the flowers for me? Did you see your jacket? The he wore before he hit his head I've seen it, I've seen it! Nice flat, you know? The windows are missing. And you have a nice jacket. No, but I'm attached to it. Where did you get it? Are you crazy? Keep off your hands. No, I mean, where did you get it? Romolo, what are you doing? Are you nuts? Can't I touch my own jacket? I wanted to check is he had any change left of my money. It's ready! Enjoy your meal. Madam, do you only have one daughter? No, I have a son too. But I'd rather not talk about him. Why, he made you so proud! He had a great career. Now he is a direct... Hey, why did you kick me? Nice soup. Excellent. Another spoonful and he can see the crest of Rome's team. The crest of Rome's team! But I am a Lazio's fan! Excellent, but I can't eat. Why? Otherwise I can't eat the second course. The spinaches are for pa. You don't like spinaches, right? I don't like it? I love it! And he drove me crazy for 20 years! - He never ate them! - Who? Annamaria, the door. I'm here to meet the newly wed. Listen, Alvaro! Hi, how is it going? Oh, you look great. Nice house! And the TV too! May I? Just one chip. Who's this one with his hands in my plate? "This one“? You finally found somebody to sponge off, he? Who are you? How dare you? Listen Alvaro. I'm fed you of this charade, I'm going to hit him with a shoe. I can't see him in that way. You know what? This roast needs some rosemary. I'm sorry, I mistook you for a friend. You are his spitting image! Can you forgive me? May I? Just one chip. You are soiling the jacket! What do you care, it's his jacket! - No, it's mine. - Yours? To the director's good health. My apologies, but I have to go now. So soon? - May I have a word? - With me? Can you take me to the door? Pa, ask about my 300.000 lira. What are they talking about? What drives me mad is that he couldn't stand them! - Who? - The spinaches. He hits his head once... He doesn't like spinaches anymore... No more wife... He is general director... I crashed the bus many times... Nothing! It's a matter of skull! What did he want? Did he give you the money? He said he wants to marry Marisa. I told him I have to think about it. Well done! Ouch, God! When did you put these glasses up? But... what happened? Are you hurt? Hot? Take your jacket back, buffoon! His memory is back! I'll sort you out later! I am glad you are all here. So you can judge if it fair a poor man gets kicked out... Because of a mistake buying beds. Bye! But, he really got his memory back! I'm not coming back home! What do you want? How do you feel? Don't hurt him! I don't care about the rest... what happened to the 300.000 lira in my jacket? They are still here. No, you spent it. I saw you. Where? Does a place called Snick e Snack tell you anything? I didn't even leave the building! Are you sure? I swear it on mom! We need to have a few words. Sit down, it's a long story. You even ate the spinaches! - The spinaches? - You loved them! Yes, you ate the spinaches. You finally made your mom happy. You were so cool as the a director. I don't believe it... Tomorrow, you'll come with me and I'll show you. You are the boss in here. Sir. Miss, how much are the shirts? 5,000. But no touching, please. My apologies, sir! Take what you like.
