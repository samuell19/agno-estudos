Here we are. Thank you. No, thank you, my dear! - Only let me take you home as well... - Thank you, I'll walk. At least take this, doctor! - No, my friend, thank you. - No, doctor, thank you! - Take it, I'm begging you! - No, I'm begging you. - Well, I was the first to ask! - All right then. - Tell grandpa to slow down a little. - I will! - And I'll visit you soon. - And we'll come and fetch ya! - Don't bother. - I'm begging! - No, I'm begging, thank you! - No, thank you, dear! Doctor Benjamin Varlamovich Glonti It happened at the end of the previous century, in a sunny tiled town. Or maybe it didn't... No, perhaps it did happen. - Is that wine? - No, it's vinegar! The gentleman said that it's good for your skin! Is he at home? - He has a patient. - Really? Stand up. Breathe. To put it simply, like cures like. Deeper.. For the medicine is subtraction and addition. Your poor little heart is tired. It's called myocardiodystrophy. - And liver? - Lie down. Now... A subtraction of all the excesses and an addition... Breathe! ...of what's lacking. And the best one at doing this... - ...is the best doctor. - Well? Fine. And his throat? Koka, open your mouth, say "aaa". - Well? - It's good. Allow me. Now, put down your pants. There's no need for this, ma'am. Excuse me, but I want the examination to be as thorough as possible! Put them down! Good. And your underwear too! - Doctor! - Yes? Look at him. - How is it? - Perfect. - Right. - Get dressed. - It's only a dystrophy then? - Yes. All right, give us a prescription. Exercises, fresh air and rest, that's all I can suggest. No, excuse me! I was told about your eccentricities! But bear in mind that we, Kalandadze, shall spare nothing to save our child. Write a prescription! I'm sorry, but there's no medicine for this kind of illness. Write a prescription! Fresh air and temperance are his best medicine. Is that so? In this case, I'm not paying you anything! As you wish. - What a charlatan! - Who, me? Him! - A quack! - Who're you talking about, Ma'am? About that clown! Examines my poor child for hour and a half and then says "Go breathe some fresh air". What a crook! - Let's go. - Mommy, can I punch him? No, Varlam, you mustn't bully little kids. - Goo-goo, little baby. - What?! Don't just stand there! Can't you see they're insulting your mother? Go teach that intriguer a lesson! Leave me alone! Just leave me alone, okay?! Koka, wait! Okay, madam. Do your exercises. And we're the people with principles. We're going to live off our sister, since she's stupid enough. She believes she can feed a hundred people with that crow. What did you say? I said, if things keep going this way, I'll go live in a convent. And all of you can go to hell! Benjamin! Come here. Benjamin! - Greetings. - Where're you going? On a tea party. - What's that? - A gonfalon. - What tea party? - At St. Helena's. They're having a charity tea party. And what do you need this sacred thing for? As a souvenir. Wait here. Benjamin... Levan's daughter will surely be there. Mary's the best match for you in this town. - Take notice of her. - Here we go. - Yes, here we go. - We certainly will... Shut you trap! Stop laughing. Listen. As soon as the tea party ends, hand around these. - What's that? - "Flirt"! A love game. And this one - it's marked with a cross - you'll give to Mary. And she'll read this: "Three Charites were in ancient world..." - Benjamin... - Wait there. What do you want? "...but you were born and now there are four". Dress up, you'll go with him. - Mommy. - What? What?! - Can I have it? - What? That thing. How much do you have? Seven copecks. But these are for the ink. Wait here. Careful, sister. You're gonna catch cold. What a boor! Uncivilized boor! Seven copecks, you say? Let's go to the "Come again", it's enough for two bottles. Two bottles are not enough. You give two and receive four, you give four and receive eight. Father Hermogenes, can I go home now? I'll curse you! Come on, I've been sitting here like a bird the whole day! People are waiting. Traitor! Herod! You'll be anathematized! I wish I could bite my own head off. This is for you, father. Give 'em four. Attention, gentlemen! Gentlemen, a great doctor is standing beside me. A humanist, an enlightener - Benjamin! Excuse me, my friend. Gentlemen, the history will write down his name in the book of Ages with golden letters! Along with the names of Hippocrates, Copernicus and Giorgi Saakadze. Amen. Cheers, Benjamin. Doctor, could you look at my husband? - What's wrong with him? - A paralysis. - How did that happen? - It started yesterday. He wanted to crack a nut. Look at him now. Doctor Levan examined him and ordered to clysterize him. - And?.. - Well, we're doing it. Better? Thank you doctor, thank you so much! Should we continue the clysterizing? Yes, absolutely. Go on. He is... the most... he is you, father Hermogenes! Wait, wait! Let's play a game. - I'll teach you all. - Okay. - This is for you... - Young man! Are you going to play a card game in front of me, the servant of God? No, father, God forbid! This is called "Flirt"! A love game. - For example, you're a mimosa. - And you're an asshole! - No, that's not how you play it! - Wait. I'll do it myself. Let's see what's written here. - A happy young man, you've charmed me. - What?! I anathematize you, you jerk! Herod! Get lost! No, Father, I didn't mean to offend you. I play this game with my wife. For example, I'm sending her an Indian cress. And what does it say? "Oh why some other man caresses your eyes and holds your hand?" Luka, it means that your wife is a whore. What?! A whore? Sofiko is a whore?! Sofiko! - Who's there? - It's me, Tamara! Sofiko, calm down. This is life. - What happened? - Your husband has killed Benjamin. What? Where, when, how? They were playing cards in some tavern. Vanya! Vanya! - Where are you? - I'm here. Tell her! Killed him alright. What's that for? For Luka, he'll have to hide in the mountains. And that? Bandages for Benjamin. If he's still alive, that is. Look after the children. Here. Drink this. No, I don't want to! I'm fed up, I'm leaving! Sofiko, I'm here, look! - I'm alive! - Turn the child, you idiot! Have you no heart at all? It was the last time. Marry or don't marry, do whatever you want, I don't care. I'm leaving. Man, just take that Mary to the altar, will you? Nice country house, huge eyes like this! Hey, marry her yourself, if you like her so much! If I were her, I'd leave too! A house full of slackers, and she feeds them and washes their clothes! Children are ill-mannered and ungrateful! Brother is a drunkard, in debts up to his ears! Husband is so-so, mediocre at his best! What a poor choice! And she could've easily married a general! What?! How dare you speak like that about your father! Leave the child alone, monster! Take that! God, what did I do to deserve this? I'm dying! Alright, alright! I'll get married. - Swear. - I swear. I swear on Varlam. Hey, why me of all the people? - Luka. - Mm? See that house? My patient lives there. We could go there and have a glass of nice cold wine. Luka, wanna have my watch? - I do! - Let's go the "Come again" then. Not to drink, we'll just sit there for a while. No, I can't. Benjamin, if I don't take you to the bride, your sister will tear my head off. Morning, good Christians! Is Kutaisi around here somewhere? - It's there, behind your back! - There? Dammit. I must've missed it. And Tiflis, there? It's there! And that way you'll get to Istanbul. I don't need Istanbul, been there. Lots of Turks. Erzurum, let's go. Wait, Erzurum's this way! - Erzurum is... -Your dog? Yep! Well, his real name is Sharik, but a nickname is Erzurum. Because he captured some pasha under Erzurum. Just grabbed him by his pants and held there! - What about now, Luka? - Okay. Please. Erzurum, you say? You're a happy man, Egor. - Me? - Yes, you. 25 years of service. So what. You can go wherever you want now. Where to? Everybody I know is dead. Me, I'll be a copyist for another hundred years, but you're free to do anything. You're on your own! And the dog? At least it doesn't blame you for not being a general. - Do they beat you at home? - They do! Well, don't let it happen! Make a fist and... Atte-e-ention! Keep quiet. This doesn't concern you. We're both retired. - Yes? - No! - Yes. - No! But I must listen to you, my queen! - I'm in good health. - What? In good health! - Everybody says that, my dear. - I'm a married woman! Let's check your pulse then. - I'm not that kind of woman! - What? Quiet! You're interrupting. Breathe. Your wife has a bronchitis. Why so pale? Don't worry, it's perfectly curable these days. One, two, three... Sis, meet our new friend, Egor. - A general. - Nice to meet you. - Come into the house. - Thank you kindly. You come in too. You may come in as well, your Majesty. It'll be an honour. Woman! Atte-ention! Backward march! On the bank of the river... Marusya was washing her white legs. That's right. Marusya was washing her white legs... (singing in Armenian) That's right. You, citizen! - Citizen. - What? I'm looking for a doctor named Glonti. - Who? - Glonti! Gentlemen! You're looking for Glonti? Ein moment! I'm here. - Toto, my boy, where're you going? - I'll be quick, Mom! A splendid choice, gentlemen! I'm glad that... Ein moment. A boor! An uncivilized boor. He's not here, gentlemen, but we can taste a glass of sparkling wine! We're driving. Avesalom Shalvovich, why drag anyone else in this? You can come to me any time and say: "Dear Benjamin, I want to distrain your goods." And I'll tell you: "My dear friend, take everything! It's all yours! Go ahead!" No, not that. It's a tool of my trade, it cannot be seized. - Is that amber? - Yes, it is. But you don't really want to have it, and I may need it. Look, sell the house, it's your only option. It's not mine, it's my brother-in-law's. Right, I almost forgot that you're a sponger. Okay, I'll give you something that will pay off all my debts. It's a kidney stone. It came out of the governor's urinary bladder! What would I do with it? Cover it with gold, enchase it with diamonds and it will make a great present to your spouse on her name-day. - You ready yet? - We have a guest. - Hello, Avesalom Shalvovich. - Hello. - Madam. - Yes? Did you know that your brother took a loan from me to finish his education? - I know that. - Good. So bear in mind that I have a receiving order and I can demand his arrest at any moment. All the best! Idiot. Dress up. I met Levan, he said he's inviting us for dinner. Benjamin! Benjamin! Some officers need your attention! At your service, gentlemen. - Mr. Glonti? - Yes. Dear Sir, I've come to know from reliable sources that you're intending to marry the daughter of doctor Cincadze. You're strictly forbidden to do that. I that clear? What? What did he say? Now you are really getting married! Where're you going? - I want to fly! - Careful. Soon you'll have your own house. And we'll come to see you. A butterfly! Levan! Levan! He says some guy is asking for Mary's hand, is that true? Benjamin! Indeed, this is true! This is true, aunt Domna! Here he is! This one? Good God, I know him! He's even worse than you! Okay, now go mind your own business! So once a russian general was travelling through the Caucasus and singing a georgian song in a Mingrelian language. Benjamin, you look so much like your father! And here is the bride! Everyone sit down, Benjamin - come here! What a couple, huh? You sit here, and you - here. I swear on my father's ashes, after the wedding I'll take them both to Tiflis to make a photo! My darlings. And... Greetings, Levan Nikolayevich. I would like to invite you and your daughter on a car ride to see the beautiful scenery. I'm truly sorry gentlemen, but today I have guests. I hope you'll honour us with your presence at the table. Please. Go on, work. Welcome! I'm coming! To be your guest is a privilege, Levan Nikolayevich. With your permission, we'll change into something more appropriate. These are automobiles, they're like small locomotives. Mobiles-schnobiles, I don't really care. These idiots have squandered their parents' fortune and now they're circling around my house on that oil-stove all day long. It's not an oil-stove, Dad, it's called internal-combustion engine. Excuse me. Look at her, knowing it all! Benjamin, come here. Now we'll talk about the wedding. Are you sure your daughter really wants this marriage to happen? You know what, you should come here more often. We'll talk, sing, drink, enjoy ourselves, and within a month Mary will madly fall in love with you! - Yes. - Doctor! - Doctor, the miller is here. - What's wrong with him? His wife fell down the stairs, four steps high. Excuse me. - Did you bring the urine? - Yes. I told him you went to the city and come back soon. Good job. Now go, I'm coming. Ein moment! Come here. - Take it. - What's that? "Flirt"! Now go to her! - But... - A mimosa! Excuse me. - Where is your Dad? - At the drugstore. Don't touch, you'll bring microbes. Hello. What a horrible road, huh? I've traveled one hundred miles today! Could you take a look, doctor? - Can't you see that I'm tired? - He's tired as well, doctor. It's your wife's urine. Yep, she fell. That's right, "eh". She stumbled and fell down four steps of the stairs. - It was five. - No, four! - Five. - It can't be. It can't be! One can clearly see here that it's four steps. Wait, did you bring all your wife gave you? No, I spilled some on the ground. Well that explains it. You've spilled the fifth footstep, you dope. Now listen here, Savle. Turns out, we'll treat her for five footsteps. Give him... five vials. Calcius... Falcius... Natsius... Tatsius and... Prassius. - Got it. - Okay. And tell her to put a plantain on the bruise. Bring it in. You again? Go over here. - How's your mother? - She's better, doctor. Only she's hot, but still complains that it's cold. Is that so... Does she drink the extract? - She does, doctor. - I see... - Is she sweating? - She is, doctor. - I see... - We can pay you, doctor! What?! Who do you think I am? Sandro! Come here! Give her a bag of corn, and something else. - Cheese, butter, eggs. - Okay, follow me. - And let her take that ram as well! - Okay! - A malaria? - Obviously. Or maybe not. I haven't diagnosed her yet. By the way, why don't you go take a look? It's not far, near the castle. But don't take too long! Listen here, Kato. It's malaria. But it's gonna be fine, don't worry. Go to the city, find the Mizantari drugstore, and give him this. He'll give you the medicine and explain how to take it. Got it? And if he doesn't sell it on doctor Glonti's credit then... ...give him this. It's amber. And if he does sell it, you'll give it back to me. Okay. Is it faster if I go through the forest? It is, but the lord doesn't like when people walk in his forest. Who are you? And you? Me? I'm Vameh Vahvari! - And who are you? - I'm Benjamin Glonti. Benjamin? Glonti? What kind of name is that? So, Benjamin Glonti, why aren't you on your knees? - And you? - Me?! You, go. Wait a minute. So... have you changed your mind, boy? - Well? - No! What is that? His Excellency's orders. Glonti... Take your sabre and face me like a man! You naughty fellow! The jury has decided, after brief consideration, to sentence the offender to kissing Major-general of Life Guards of Austrian regiment in retirement the recipient of Order of St. Vladimir, fourth class, with swords and ribbon, the Order of St. Anna, third class, with swords and ribbon, the Order of Saint Stanislaus, with swords and ribbon... the Order of Saint Stanislaus, with swords only, no ribbon, his Lordship Vameh Vamehovich Vahvari, to kissing him in the spot which the aforementioned lord will indicate! Now you can proudly say that you've kissed a general! Faster! Faster! Faster, faster! Sandro, how much gunpowder do we have? Petre! How much gunpowder do we have? - What? - Gunpowder, I said gunpowder! - Three pounds! - Three pounds, doctor! - Doctor, if I may... - What is it? Potassium cyanide! One tenth of it is enough to poison the whole of Georgia! Let's pour it into their river! There he is! Benjamin... I was told that you'd been killed. - They've terribly insulted me, Levan. - What?! Take the sabre! Lead us! We'll raze them to the ground! Not a single stone will be left! We'll turn them into dust! Don't do that, Levan. He'll go complaining to the tsar, and they'll send us all to Syberia. Let's go, Levan. Yes, but we must avenge you. Don't worry about that. I swear that I won't become your son-in-law until I have my revenge. Now, that's too much, my dear friend. You may have your sweet revenge just as well after the wedding. Doctor, your patients want to go home, what shall I do? - Let them go. - You can go home now! Go. Leave that. Hey, Absalom! Go! What a boor! An uncivilized boor! I warned you not to come here! Benjamin, don't make a tragedy out of it! Big deal! You're not the first one, you know! Goodbye! Wait! Don't shoot! I have food, wine, your sister sent it. Don't come closer! No wine! I'll eat stones until I take revenge! Leave! Okay, I'm going. Hey! How are things at home? Like always. They're expecting a baby. Give it here. - Margo, guess what? - What? The lord is sick. Choked with the bone. All the doctors are too afraid of him to come. What do I care? Am I a doctor or something? - Well, tell him, you know... - Who? Tell who? The one who's sitting in the chapel. His Lordship has choked over the fish bone during dinner. I hope you won't refuse to help. We're obliged to help everyone. Come in, please. Open your mouth, please. Oh dear... What's the matter? He's choked with a poisonous bone. We didn't know, that trout has poisonous bones. A usual trout - no, but here we're dealing with a rare type of it - it's called ionicus morre. This gentleman's got 15 minutes, after that I can't guarantee his safety. Well then, start immediately! I'm sorry, but one small formality must be taken care of first. - Do it, what're you waiting for? - I'm not sure, though, that I'm brave enough to suggest what I should be suggesting to you - the general, the recipient of Orders with and without ribbons, a descendant of a noble clan. Are you scoffing at me, you quack?! Two months ago, you've dragged a man here and insulted him. So it is you. Yes, this is me, Your Excellency. Name a price, then! No, I want you to restore my honour, Vameh Vamehovich. Alright, I'll admit that I was wrong, in black and white. Really? I'm amazed! What a nobility! No, my dear, you're going to kiss me in the same place that I kissed you. Hey! Skin him alive and throw him in the cellar! I want to hear him screaming! - Guards! - Fine, but bear in mind, that in 10 minutes it will be too late. Stop! Let him go, I said! Are you that cruel? Isn't forgiveness more sweet than revenge? Believe me, Lady, if that insult were delivered by you, I would gladly give up the revenge. No! No! No! Very well, I agree. - Get out, everyone! - No. They were witnesses of my humiliation, they might as well watch the revenge. Only Lady has a right to leave. And you, sing! That's enough! Now that we're even, I'll attend to your throat. Open your mouth, please. Don't be afraid. Atta boy. And that's it! Here! See for yourselves. Mary! Mary! - What, father? - Do you know who that man is? - I know, father. - No you don't! Benjamin, show us where the lord has kissed you! Father! Benjamin, is that true that you've fed on stones last two months? What a town. Whatever you do - everyone knows it the next day. That's what comes of being young! I swallowed a stone once when I was a kid - and nothing happened! Benjamin, you studied in Petersburg, did anyone eat stones there? No, of course not. See? Only we, Georgians, can do anything! There he is! Benjamin, this gentleman was looking for you! Here, read! - Read! - Let me. To Mr. Glonti. His Excellency Lord Vahvari, is asking Mr. Glonti to forget the incident that took place before, and to accept a sum of 100 rubles as a reward for masterful skills. Here is a hundred. Make a receipt. - A hundred?! - Yes, a hundred! Give it to me. Listen here, my friend, take it back to the lord and tell him that he'd already paid off his debt. And if he wants to buy my silence then it's too late for that. You can go now. You're lucky the Lady defended you, or the lord would've shown you! Wait a minute, he must joking. - Benjamin, tell him it was a joke. - Go. Say hello to the Lady! See that? Turns out, it's better when the high and mighty are afraid of you. Is that what you want? Very well, Benjamin Glonti I'll make sure that you rot in jail, starting tomorrow! You pitiful clown! It's a shame, I could pay you those two rubles I owe you from last year. Don't want to hear about it! It's all settled! Although... That money was rightfully yours. You could've just taken it and give it to whoever you want. Come on fellas, come out. Let's walk. It's raining, man! You call this a rain? Look at me! Well? Did anything happen to me? No. Come out, let's take a walk. Tell me, foreigner, why are people afraid of jail so much? - Well? - Why shouldn't they be? Isn't a sick person imprisoned in his bed? Or a merchant in his store? A citizen in his city, a king in his kingdom, even God in his own realm. - Aren't they all prisoners? - Of course. Tell me then, foreigner, have you ever wanted to travel with the clouds? Of course. To become a particle of the air and fly away into the unknown? Of course. But you're imprisoned on earth, right? You're right. I thought, I'd buy some toffee and bring it home and everyone will be happy. Say "thank you" at least, but no! Two years, they said! You're a smuggler! - You want a toffee? - Sure! And I don't have one. Glonti, you can go! You're out on bail. Hey! Varlam! Good afternoon. Hello. This is for you. Thank you. Father's not at home, he's in Batumi. I came to see you. I bet, that these flowers are from the grave of your previous patient, Mr. Glonti. Glonti... Schmonti... My, you're also a dandy! Mary, look at that! Your fiancee is dressed in crimson boots, it seems to be the latest thing. What a fascinating handkerchief! I'm pretty sure that this lace came from, say... the drawers of his charming sister. Alex! Yes, from the drawers of his charming sister! Excuse me. What's the matter? Pardon me. After you. - What's the matter? - Pardon me. What is the ma... A scoundrel! You'll be hearing from my representatives! At your service! - There's a stain... - Get away! Get away! I'm sorry it turned out this way. Are you going to fight him on a duel? - Do you love him? - Yes! - Does your father know? - No. He doesn't understand Alex. Nobody understands him. I'm begging you, please don't kill him. Then he will kill me. But I'm bearing his child! It's cold. Let's apologize and go home. - Why do you have my watch? - You gave it to me. If I get killed you can inherit it. Gentlemen, I think the lieutenant is about to arrive at any minute. Could you... - Who, me? - Yes, you. - Captain Gabriadze. - Luka. Check the pistols. I don't know how. - Hold it. - Okay. - This one is tighter. - What? Benjamin, she ran away! - She ran away with that rascal! - Where? I don't know anything. I come home and she's not there! You're my hope, Benjamin! Go after them, bring me back my daughter! Stop. What is that? That's it. Alex, I'm afraid, let's turn back. We've burned the bridges, I haven't appeared at the duel. - I feel sick - I'll bring you some water. - Don't go, I'm afraid! - And I'll get the tickets. Alex, don't go! Two tickets to Tiflis. Seltzer water, please. I said Seltzer! Who's that? Who are you? Lieutenant Ishkhneli, at your service! I see... - Lieutenant Ishkhneli. - One more bottle. Why aren't you on your knees, lieutenant? - You, sir, are a boor! - What?! I demand satisfaction! - After you. - A duel, here, now! Murderers! Murderers! Alex! Go ahead. The child will live. As for the mother... Premature birth... Partus praematurus, after psychogenic shock. Prepare Levan. But the child will live. Levan, You're the most disobedient patient in my practice. You don't listen to your doctor at all. Why did God waste his time and send diseases to us if there are people who can cure them? Yes... Tell me, when shall I die? You have no more than five days. Great diagnosis. Do I have the Sunday? Yes. Then do me one more favour. Invite my friends to dinner here, Sunday. And one more thing. I want to be buried here, at this spot. And to make sure that you come and see your old friend from time to time I'm leaving you the house and the land. Don't. No. Dear friends, this is my last feast. And I want to see only glasses full of wine and cheerful faces. Amen. So be it that each of us leaves in his time. So... when God takes my sinful soul don't mourn over me. And instead of mourning put roses in your buttonholes By the way... who's going to say the funeral oration? I want to hear, while I'm still alive, the things people will say about me after my death. Let the lawyer do it. No. I would prefer that you did it, Benjamin. - Me? - Yes, speak, my colleague. Say it like you're seeing me in a coffin. Well... the man, whom we are burying today, will certainly leave a unanimous grief. No... No. No, it's a lie. Well, then let's put it this way. He leaves sincere, inconsolable friends who'll mourn eternally. No, Benjamin. God gave the ability to forget to those who walk the path of life. Slowly it follows the death's trail and wipes off its tracks. What if I say - friends who'll remember him for a long time? Farewell. Stranger, put a flower on his grave. I think I'll add a few words. Gentlemen. Here, in front of this grave I'll tell the truth and only the truth. Look at the deceased. Look at his inspired waxen face. Well, well. Enough looking. Sandro, play that... No, I won't say anything about the virtues, merits and talents of the deceased. I won't. We had been witnesses to that more than once. Silence! I'm asking for silence! Levan, they've brought the coffins, black and red. Which one do you want? Black. And what shall we do about the red one? Give it to Savle. Are you mad? Why would he need such an expensive coffin? You could bury the whole orchestra with this kind of money! Go and do whatever you're doing. Found a reason to get drunk, huh? If you're dying, do it like normal people do! Who will inherit the house - this lunatic? Thank you, doctor. Only can I have the black one? I swear I like it much better! You can have this. Tell me Father, what do you think, will I see my girl there? What're you sighing about? Do you think that I'll go to hell? - No. - What? There's nothing. How come, Father? What about heaven? Begone! Get out, Satan! Damn your bread, your water and your cards! This is a great wake, isn't it? So, I continue... Everyone, shut up! Let him go, Luka! Sit down! Stop the music! - That's right. - You too, shut up! A babbler! The man is leaving for good, and you're making a farce out of it! What're you screaming about? Are you wet? Wait. Well? Take it. My dear Benjamin, long time no see! - Where're you going? - Home. - Isn't it this way. - No, Costa, not for me. Of course it's not for you, my dear. Let's go, I'll give you a ride! - Thank you, I'll walk. - No, thank you, my dear! - Please, I'm begging you! - Okay, but this nobleman will ride. - Who's he? - Him? - Yes! - Benjamin the second. - The second? - Yes. I took him from them. What can they teach him... I'll bring him up myself. Of course, my dear, who can do it better than you? I'll bring him to my sister. I think she'll be glad. Of course she will, why not? The film is loosely based on the novel "Mon Oncle Benjamin" by Claude Tillier.
