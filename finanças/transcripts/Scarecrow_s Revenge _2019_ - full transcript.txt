A curse. What nonsense. Ida? Ida? Ida? Ida? Ida? Ida? Ida? Ida? What? What are you doing? I'm resting. It's too hot in the sun. And I nicked my hand cutting corn. The clouds are out now. Gather what you can. We will head to Lord Melberg's castle, and deliver his corn. So I have to work and you rest. Sullen child. Father? 'Tis nothing. Father, I'm tired. My whole body is tired. Can we take this corn back to the castle and go home now. You've clearly been in the sun for far too long today. Father? Who is that? Who is that? Stop! Urgh! Urgh! Argh, argh. Oh no, please. Argh! Please. Olof, summon the village for dinner. Do we have boar? Er, they're preparing one. One of the remains. Is that all? You must go hunting tomorrow. Yes, my king. I'm not king yet. Just jarl for now. You are king to us. You'll give me a big head and then no crown will fit me. Get about your job. What are you doing? I want to go fishing today. Got to Fensula. Oh it's boring. No daughter of mine should be bored by anything in nature. But what about this lake here? It's bigger and must surely have more fish. I've told you before. Never go to that lake. Nothing lives there. It's cursed by black magic. I do not believe in that nonsense. I believe only what my eyes show me. Greta, I've told you. Let that be an end to it. No one who goes there comes back home. Not everything can be seen with your eyes. Black magic exists. Witchcraft exists. Well, is it any match for a viking warrioress with her sword? No. Nothing's a match for that. But please, today, go to Fensula. And one day I'll take you to the great rivers of Bolder. The journey alone will test you. And when we're there, we shall catch fish the like that you only get to see in Valhalla. As you wish. Too much aggression Greta. Your strikes must be measured. And calculated. Tactical. Most of your opponents will be blinded by fury. They will have nothing but hope of victory, because they did not know in their hearts what we know. What is that father? That whether we're victorious or defeated in combat, if we are honorable, we will see Valhalla in the next life. Control your emotions. You'll have nothing but victory in your life before the next world. My jarl. Father. You must excuse me, but you're needed at once. There is trouble, in Balak. Trouble? Henerik and the other men, they stole ale from the village and they took two women away. One escaped to raise alarm but the other one is still with them. Olof is keeping an eye on them. Who haa Henerik taken? Lisbeth. Does Malcolm know his daughter's gone. Yes, he took his wife with Estella. Take Noomi back to the village. Tell the other men to keep watch. I can help you father. No, go back to the village. Shall we go? Just in time my jarl. How many are there? I see two. No sign of Henerik or Lisbeth though. And Olof? I sent him back to watch the village. The sooner we find my daughter and we hang Henerik the better, before my blood boils. Calm yourself. We're vikings, not savages. And we've got a fight on our hands. Fine. Let's deal with these fools first then. They're coming out. I'm ready. Where is Henerik? And where is the girl that he took. To hell with the girl. They probably already had their way with her. Argh! Please let me go! Please! Please let me go! Let me go! Let me go, please. When is it my turn? Yes. Let me go, please! Let me go! No one hears your screaming miss. No one can hear you! Oh, to fend viking bossom. You have to inspect. Oh I say. You bastard! Now no one can hear you, you pig! Henerik! Lisbeth! What did this animal do to you daughter? He tried to force himself upon me, father. We shall find him, and hang him. Take Lisbeth back to the village. We'll deal with Henerik. Where is he? I do not know. I ran away from him, as fast as I could. I want him dead. That's not the way, Malcolm, you know that. He'll be banished. He'll be banished. Please, father, take me home. I need to rest. He was last seen near the cornfields. And old one, that was poisoned by foul crows. That cursed plane. Isn't that Lisbeth's bracelet? He's been through here. We can track him. - The Gaul. - What? He's heading back to the village as if he's done nothing wrong. He's taken Freyers past the plain. Let's cut him off. Man, a good grace of fear. Home soon. Perhaps not so gracious. I got this. Do not run, Henerirk! You'll only make it harder on yourself. You've over stepped the line again, Henerik. You are mistaken. - The wench... - her name is Lisbeth. The wench, wench promised it to me. Then went back on her word. That is not good frankly. - Argh, argh! - Please stop Malcolm! Should've stayed at the village with Lisbeth. - Let's hang him! - No! We're vikings, not savages. Besides he did not succeed. My jarl, what do you suggest? He is to be banished, from hence forth. And all his possessions in the village are to be given to Lisbeth, to do with as she sees fit, as compensation for his actions. Is this pleasing to you, Malcolm, for you and your kin? I accept your decision. Well, I do not accept... He is to be banished. And if he returns to the village, he will be hung for disgracing the viking code. Damn you and your code. Stellon, you remember that old cornfield, the one with the cursed scarecrow? Yes, that retched thing scared not a single crow and attracted plague to those crops. Probably witches work. Take Henerik to that spot. Tie him to that scarecrow. And if he's not yet persuaded to accept his banishment, then you have my permission to persuade him further. At your leisure. Do not kill him, though, Malcolm, do you understand? A curse on you. To hell with you viking. A curse on your own village. I will see you, burn in hell. You will never make it to Valhalla. I have a throne waiting for me there, Henerik. All you have to look forward to is purgatory. - Move it. - Can't hear you. - Speak, this way on. - This isn't the end. - Almost there brother. - Good, this pig arse of a man is heavy. I warned you punk, do not risk your precious soul as... - Silence! - Leads to destruction, - leads you to destruction too. - Silence! Tie him to the scarecrow. - Maolcolm! - Anymore from you I'll make a eunuch of you! - Standby jarl. - There will be no sign of Henerik. You didn't kill him. He's still alive. Hopefully his lesson is learned. This is the honorable way, my brothers. Here you go. Thank-you, Noomi. You may go now. As you wish. Sleep well, Lisbeth. You have been through a big trauma. Do you think they will kill him. No, my father wouldn't allow it. Shame. My father doesn't allow a lot of things. Don't speak ill of him Greta, he's a good man. I know, but he is a pain in my backside. Suh! Oh, sorry. It's okay. Malcolm. You're my most trusted carl. I hope you don't resent my decision. If it had been Greta, I... With all due respect, sir, if it were Greta, Henerik would've died trying. She's strong, like you. I hope you're right. I see much of her mother in her. How is she? Ah, she's all right. Her wounds were minor. She was not deflowered. She asks after you Malcolm. I'll take my leave. Goodnight to you both. And thank-you, I, we all owe you so much. What were you talking about with him? I heard you say something about my mother. Nothing Greta. You worry I'm like her. Why? Not now, child. I must rest, and so must you. We have much to do in the village tomorrow. Hah, I'm to come on the hunt with you today. You've got the chest of a peach and then arms like sapling branches. What good are you? Our, jarl granted. Orin you are playful today. As you know very well, it's Loki that's the playful god. Do you have a problem, Olof? No, no. Agh! Try, come on. Well come on then, get on with it. I'm looking forward to getting out there with Troy, Jarl. He's a fine warrior. Even the most puny sapling may become the might oak. Exactly what my wife said last night. You were a sapling last night and always will be. Be gone woman. Damn woman. She's a good woman, Malcolm. You've done well there. What ails you this morning? I think we should check on Henerik, make sure he hasn't returned. We should make sure. Check the perimeter of the village, a mile out. Take the four points. You take north and east, take Stellon. And he can take south and west. - Very well. - I'm sure he's well gone. What brings you to my lair, Henerik of the Larsons. I know. Then you will know you cannot leave, and you will know there is a great price for anything that you ask of me. Tell me what you want, Henerik of the Larsons. Those words are lost to you now Henerik. Tell me why you came. Or I will feast on your organs here where you stand. I, I want revenge. On who? I want all the vikings of Agrenia dead. And the village destroyed. And what do you offer? I offer whatever the witch desires. You came here so I will take your body. That is the price you pay for my company. For your vikings, I will take your eternal soul. You do understand the consequence? They are not for the next world, if I leave this one without vengeance. Then I tell you now, I will give you great power, in a new vessel. I will give you two days to fulfill your task. For your soul and every soul you slay. It will belong to me. Do you accept, Henerik of the Larsons? I accept. Take my body now. Waste no more time witch. Now! When your soul hardly nightfall. Yes, yes. We've been walking for ages. I have seen no boars yet. Not even a rabbit. Stop complaining. The day's early still. We continue on until Odin blesses us. - What're you doing? - Shh shh shh shh. Okay, now, you flag the animal, and keep your distance and by the grace of Odin, please be silent. Go. Olof, olof! Our dinner escaped at the sound of your howling. Sorry, brother. This, it was here. What was here? Scarecrow. - Scarecrow, - Yeah. - Out here. - Just there. Brother, have you been nibbling mushrooms in here. Hmm, hmm hmm. Let's not waste more time. It was here, over there. - Just, the... - Hunt, let's continue the hunt, right. The day's escaping us. And we can't dine on scarecrow. Come on. Hmm hmm, see that? I see that. It must have moved. Troy, scarecrows do not move. What do we do, what do we do? Stay here. Stay here. Ugly beast. Troy! Ugh! Hmm, more. Olof. Olof. Devil! Devil. Ah, agh, argh! Argh, urgh! No sign. Olof and Troy are yet to return. Darkness has fallen. What shall we do? We cannot track at night. We'll have to wait 'til morning and go then. You don't think Henerik got to them? Have you seen him since this morning? No. It appears from his movements he headed west toward the Jelder pathway. The Jelder path? What is it? You know what is near that path? Yes, and surely even Henerik will not tread there. He probably passed and headed out to Harvech. It's a place of bandits that would suit him well. Probably. We'll find Troy and Olof tomorrow. It's late. If they've gone far they'll have set up camp. We should go to dinner. No meat tonight. We'll turn into deer at this rate. This sure makes a good firewood. If I knew my husband had been so well dressed. Whoa, argh ha ha! Urgh Malcolm? Malcolm what is it? Viking what happened? Malcolm! Don't my jarl, please. In the name of Odin, tell me what happened? There's a sickle in her back. Her neck snapped in a noose. Her organs strewn across the path. Ana is dead. No sign of Lisbeth, though. Just a neckerchief stained in blood. I've never seen such brutal savagery. Who? The murderer left his signature. An H carved in her face. Why didn't you hang him? Why didn't you let me kill him off? - What will we do father? - Permission to enter. You may enter. How is he? I keep my words my Jarl, I was in the deepest of grief. There's no need to apologize. We will right this wrong together. We will punish Henerik with a slow death and we will find Lisbeth. Double the guards at the gate. Everyone else ready your weapons. We have hunting to do. Let me go with you father. I am a good tracker, I can help you find Henerik and we can send him to purgatory together. No. I set no argument, you're staying here. Listen to me, old man. You have no son, you only have me. When you are gone, I will have to lead this village. I will have to lead us in battles, I will have to lead us in hunts, I will have to carry us all to Valhalla, sooner, or later, you must later, you must let me fulfill my bloodline! It's your bloodline that worries me. You speak in riddles, father! I have had enough. I want to come with you. No. Say nothing. Let's just find the heathen. Lisbeth. Take the three points men. I'll take the front this time vikings. No, no! What brings you back here, Henerik of the Larsons? Is this a gift? From Lisbeth? Her heart. Haa, haa. Greta, aren't you well? I have to go. I have to hunt my father and the men. That's men's work, Greta. No. It's viking work. Ah, fuck! Stellon what madness is this! Do not creep up on me! Olof's dead too. I found Troy. I lost all trail of anything. Same. What man could've done this? Surely not a coward like Henerik. Something's out there, but it's no man. Grieve later viking, hunt first. No man disappears into thin air. You are not Henerik. Can I help you pretty? Are you from Halvec? Yes. Have you had a stranger visit your town recently? No. The gods have been very generous today. You two are messing with the wrong viking. You're not viking. Only men are vikings. No, no no! Viking? Viking pick up your sword! We can't win. We can't win and the village will fall. Pull yourself together viking. The village will not fall. I must go. Please, have you lost your senses? I must go to the Black Lake. By the majesty of Valhalla, you have lost your senses. A true viking leader never gives in. What is this? It's our only chance. I must see the witch. No, you know you'll toll. Fight until your last breath. Hold off the monster until I've completed my quest. The village must not fall, viking. Do you understand me? Find the monster. Do your best. Valhalla awaits. Elena? Do not toy with me. Show yourself. You know why I'm here Elena. I do not go by that name anymore. Have you been completely consumed by evil? I have an insatiable taste for souls. Tell me your wish. To be rid of this heathen. Save the village. Save Greta. Greta? That is her name. Why did you choose that name? It is the name of our first child. I know not of what you speak. Our first child died at birth. That's why you gave yourself to this witchcraft. So that you could bring her back. I failed. I did not know enough, I did not have enough power. But you did not fail the second time. We have beautiful daughter. Does she about me? Does she know what flows through her blood? No. And she never will. I can offer you a choice, viking. What? You can save the village or you can save Greta. Is there no good left in you? No, that is your choice and you know what I will ask of you. The viking choice. Or the selfish one. Is there nothing of my Elena left? No, make your choice. You know my choice. I foresaw it days ago. The lake told me. Just grant me one last thing. I beg you. If there's any remnant of my Elena left, take pity on me. Grant me the time to say goodbye to my Greta. You will have the time it takes this sand to go through the timer to find her, and to deliver your parting message. You may not have long. So I suggest you make haste. Go now! What madman puts a scarecrow in the woods? Scarecrow, have I seen you before. Looks like the same straw man we tied Henerik to. What are you? Bless me this Odin. Help me, help me. No! Greta! - Ah. - I found you. Do not heed those screams. It's too late for Stellon. Why, why are you not at the village? I came to help. Do not berate me father. What is wrong? What is wrong? What's wrong, what's wrong? The village, she's cursed. I cannot be undone. Cursed? The witch. What witch? What curse? Father, father this is madness. Tell me, tell me what I must do to save the village. - Oh the village is gone. - Tell me, tell me! The witch. What witch? What curse? Father father this is madness. Father! Tell me, tell me. Tell me, tell me. Our village is lost. I made a bad, I made a bad choice. I did not make a leader's choice. I made a selfish, a selfish choice. Because I love thee. Let me, let me go see the witch. No, no. - Father. - You must not go. I beg you. Father, father, father! Father! Father! Father. Father, father! Father father father! Father father father. I have to go see the witch with my own eyes. I have to save the village. Do not tease my fish, Greta. I see more of me than your father. You have a beautiful complexion. What madness are you spouting witch? Did your father not tell you? Tell me what? About your mother. He told me my mother's dead. No. I am your mother. No. You feel it. You know it to be true. Do you not always have a earning to come here. I have waited for years to draw you here. But your father was a persuasive and commanding man. You killed him. He gave himself up willingly. No one who enters my realm leaves alive. I can give them something in return, for a price. What price witch? I took his soul. He gave up his village, all of his kin, even his place in Valhalla, for you. Why am I so special? You are very special Greta. But you are torn between two destinies, the vikings destiny and witchcraft. I will always be a viking. What good is it being a viking without a village? Go now Henerik of the Larsons. You have a village to destroy, and little time to do it. No, no, please, stop him. I beg you mother. My mother. You must have some good in her. Stop Henerik. Daughter, Henerik paid a price. I will not stop him. And no mortal can. He will go when his time is done. There must be something I can do. Fulfill your destiny. Give yourself up to the dark arts. To witchcraft. I can put a spell upon your sword. And you can slay Henerik before the village falls. At what price witch? When it is done, you will be bound by this lake. You will become immortal. Greta. I cannot. I dishonor my father by even being here. And what of your village, do you know want them to live? Women, children. Decide quickly. Do it. And make heed. I have a village to save. But no one has returned yet. This is worrying. We're weakened without our jarl and his warriors. They'll return, no one can defeat them. I do not recall a scarecrow being there. Maybe someone put him there when our attention was turned. If anybody sneaks past us into the village, we'll be in trouble. Relax, there's no way. This is merely the work of a jester. Is this the one from over near the field by three point path? It looks like it. Why would someone put such a cursed scarecrow near our village? They say there was field with the most lustrous corn that died under the watch of this wretched thing. Twice, the farmer enraged had to burn it. And both time the fire just faded away. The third time he tried he burned alive. The fire jumped onto him. Nonsense. What can we do with this cursed thing? Relax, we simply have to Go back to your quarter. Seal the wound with fire, and see the healer. Henerik! Is that all you've got? Urgh! Ugh. So this is my destiny. What of Henerik? He's gone. What did you feel when you killed him? Nothing. I felt nothing. Not even the energy. I don't feel Henerik's soul is within me. I thought maybe your instinct might've caused you to consume him yourself. Nothing happened. This is not possible. Henerik is not dead. Urgh, there is, please, argh. Now, he's dead. You save me. I felt this power surge through me. I did something that goes against Odin. It defies natural law. Did it feel good. It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I was so close to death and then, this power came from nowhere. You were bound to the lake, and you cannot leave. But you can learn everything within this. And your power within this realm is almost limitless. You can steal the destiny of souls from their place in the next life. Like you sole my father's. He gave it willingly. What if I wanted to give a soul back? Could I do that? Only in death. I'm sorry, mother, for what I must do. My father deserves no less than his place in Valhalla. Greta. Valhalla. Valhalla! I saw the others up ahead. We should go and join them then. Argh, I can't even do that right. Right. Oh! Who are you? You do not know? Do you not know of this place? Who are you? What ails you Gregor of Karraf. what's the matter. I feel bad for Gregor. Why do you feel for that lowly blacksmith. You're way to pretty for that old workhorse. Besides, soon I will make you as pretty as me. We'll be going to my castle tomorrow. And there I will buy you the finest dresses, and adorn you in the most exotic jewels. For you are beautiful. - What the... - what is it? It's, it sounds like scavengers. Why don't you go and find out. - Me? - Yes you. You're a village girl. They'll see you have no money and leave. But, what if they want something more? You must go. Look, if I go, they'll kill us both and leave us for the crows. Now, now go, now. You call yourself a man. Maybe someone's by the look of it. Seven take. What was that? Let's hand him I will give you two days to fulfill. - Henerik. - And you didn't kill him. Apparently my husband likes these well dressed.
