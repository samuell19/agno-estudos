Come on, tumbleweed. Come on. Come on. Up on your gait. Come on. Good. Hyah! Come on, tumbleweed! That's it. Whoo! Come on. Come on. Come on, girl. Good girl. Let's get that hot saddle off of you. Give you a good sponge-down. Stop with that umbrella. You'll break it! Come back here! I got it. I got it. Butch! Aren't you coming in? Ow, ow, ow, ow! A crab got me! Joni, watch out for crabs! Joni! Joni! Butch! Butch, help! Butch! Butch! Butch, help! Butch! Hey, somebody needs help. Butch! I got her. I got her back. Butch, I can't move. Hold her head. I got her. It's ok. Oh, my god. Who is it? Oh. Kathy. Yes, joni. I'm right here. My nose tickles. It feels like sand or something. Check her in over there. I'll be right back. Once I catch my breath, I should be ok. This...crazy numbness is bound to wear off. Diving? It was super dumb. That's 70% of our business. Don't feel privileged. Ouch when you feel something. Ok. Uh... Excuse me, um... Do you-- my daughter is here. Can I go home tonight? Joanie, I know this-- it's not joanie. It's joni. My father assumed I'd be a boy. If that crab hadn't bit me, I never would've turned around, and then it would've been too late. John's here. Dad, you have to sign something. So they can operate, John. All right. Let's find a doctor. Your numbness is caused by a fracture somewhere in the spinal column. Now we're going to relieve the pressure... There... In surgery. Hey. What are you doing? No jokes. Not my hair. Be still. Stop it! Listen. My dad's going to do something terrible! Keep her quiet. Joni, please. Stop it! It's all right. Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're just scaring me. Stop it, please. Be still. The lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want. How you feeling? Oh, ok. [Telephone rings] Country club pool. Dick filbert? Hold on. Hey, dick! You got a call. Dick filbert. Yeah. Hi, Jay. I know you and joni were planning something later. Hey, Jay. What happened? [Siren] You're the earecksons, right? I'm doctor sherrill. Joni's spinal column is fractured. Actually, the cord is severed. In other words, she's broken her neck. There's no way she can die? In front of US, four critical days. Flip. Stops bedsores. Two hours on her back, two on her stomach. No... [Mumbling] Must be some nightmare. It's the restraints that get me. Hey, somebody. I'll get it. Joni, I'm here. What is it? That awful groaning. Somebody's rattling chains somewhere. It'll all go away soon, honey. You just need some rest. What kind of a place is this? Joni! Joni! Joni! I wish somebody here knew something. [Dog whimpers] Hello. [Dog barks] [Dog whines] How's it going with him? [Telephone rings] I'll work it out. Intensive care unit. Pauline Jensen speaking. Oh. Yes, Dr. Thomson. Mm-hmm. [Dog whines] Demerol 100 mg. Uh...uh, yes. I.m.i.q. Three to fours hours for pain. All right, doctor. I'll take care of it. Hey, pauline. I need some help with Mrs. Wallace. Hi, gorgeous. People die here, Dickie. Come on. Ah, come kiss Jon. Oh, he's wonderful. Oh, he's so soft and furry. Even though he wet on me. I suppose you're used to dumb questions. Try me. Ok. I broke my neck, so I'm supposed to be dead. Why is it taking so long? You've made it through four weeks. I'd say the crisis was over. You're going to continue as a dues-paying member of the human race. I'm going to operate soon, fuse the bones in your neck back together. Then we can get rid of those tongs. Mom, did you know? No. How about a private room? With a window? Well, at least there's some color. I don't think I'll ever like white again. Where can I put tumbleweed? On the ceiling. Ta-da! Oh, that's disgusting. Well, is it clean? Mom, I'm not that stupid. I'll be back in a minute. John, the doctor promised to come right down as soon as joni's... In recovery. Has Dr. Sherrill come out of surgery yet? I really wouldn't know, sir. Dr. Sherrill! She's fine, Mr. Eareckson. I was just coming down. It went very well. When I was younger, wrestling was my game. I made it to the Olympics in '32. There's a split second when you press your opponent, you get a hammerlock or something, and you push it. You can feel his strength bend to yours. You get so high you're invincible. I guess you've had that in your game, too, where your fingers and your brain tell you you're winning. Something like that. What I need to know, doctor, is-- have you been winning since you met US? Like you said... That fusion business went ok? The doctor says the operation went fine. They'll be bringing joni from recovery in a few minutes. Would you be interested in redecorating all our private rooms? We wouldn't be any good. You have to know who it's for. John. Joni's going to need lots of help. The toughest part of the battle is the psychological aspect. But you said the operation was successful. The doc says that, uh... Joni will... Always be paralyzed. The fusion surgery doesn't change that, but we are confident that she'll get the use of her hands back in time. Oh, she's here. ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ for she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ for she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ which nobody can deny ♪♪ Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Is it my birthday? I'll get it, mom. We'll have supper in the dining room. We'll have to move stuff around. The kitchen's ok. Set up the dining room. No more throw-together meals. What should we have tonight, broccoli or spinach? Eew. [Dish breaks] We're not going to handle this like...Nincompoops. You idiot! Stupid jerk! You must have hands like meat hooks. Her nerves are all standing at attention right now. They're beginning to heal. It's a good sign. Shut the door. Please. Daddy, I hate it when you get on the floor to see me. The floor's my second home. Has been for a long time. You've always been a champ. You always will be. I got you a little present. Just till you can move your head more. I can almost see the whole room. Am I going to be in this thing a long time? Dad...please be straight with me. It'll really help to know. Joni, the doctor says your injury is more or less permanent. Honey... Your dancing days are over. Daddy, i'm going to walk. I--i don't know what you're so worried about. [Joni mumbling] How can any of this be your will? I did all the things you're supposed to do to be a Christian. I was sorry for my sins. All of them. Really. How could you let this happen to me? [Mumbling] It's stupid trying to talk to you. You're as... Impersonal as the machines in this place. What a dumb thing to believe you really care about people... About what happens to US. You got to help me, Diana. You're my best friend. Sure. Name it. We've both been kidding. Sooner or later it'll happen. I want it to be sooner. Give me something. Give me some pills. Hey, now who's acting crazy? I'm already dying, and I'm nearly dead now. You're not. If I could move, I'd do it myself. If you love me, you got to do something. Cut my wrists. There's no feeling. It's a good idea. There won't be anybody to tell. I can't. Don't ask me. Then I'll do it myself. Stop it, joni. It's a sin. Sin? What's sin got to do with it? I don't have anything to remember but yesterday. We're going to toughen you up for transfer to rehabilitation. Trying to dump me, huh, doc? They can do a lot more for you. Motor-damage cases are their specialty. You have feelings in your shoulders, upper arm, and chest. It's possible to train other back and shoulder muscles to compensate for certain arm muscles you've lost. You mean getting my hands back? Your chart says you should have 50% use of your biceps. The biceps moves the upper arm through most of its range of motion. Now, we won't know what you can do until you work at it. What a hassle. What time is it? 7:50. How was your day? What kind of a visit is that? They were all short hops. I started hitching after class. Took five rides to get here. Hey, what are you doing? Just changing the scenery a little. The nurse will go crazy. Now, do you really care? No. Had this lousy nightmare that stayed all day. I dreamed you left me for Ginny north. Ginny north? Tell me you love me. Dick, tell me you'll never leave me, never. I love you. Love you. Love you. And I will never leave you. Just like a pinball machine-- you bump me, you score. I never thought I'd do that. You're moving your head more. Great. Therapy every day-- it's hell. I can only make it if you're with me. If you leave me, I'll die. I just know it. Listen, lady Macbeth... If you'll stow that dark soliloquy... I'll say it again. I love you, and I'll always be here. Always. They're talking about taking me out of here. Uh, rehabilitation hospital. Oh, when? Who knows? They decide everything. That means progress, right? Oh... Wait. Please. Careful, honey. It's polluted. So much color. Mmm. Almost hurts my eyes. People are entitled to leadership. There's nothing good on until 8:00. They just throw in all these reruns. I heard there's rioting in Newark. Johnson's calling in paratroopers. Could that happen in Baltimore? I only know you better eat, or they'll put you back on that bottle. Sorry. We always talked at dinner. Hey, don't worry. We bat over 400 around here. Oh. Hey, that's great. 10 degrees is good for the first time. Earl, could you look at my car later? That clutch again? Foreign jobs are bummers. Yeah, but it's cute. Wait. Don't go any higher. I can't. Feels like you're blacking out? The blood will head for your brain again. You'll be sitting up by Thanksgiving. I'll bet you 5. No bet with this one. Raoul, this is not a turnpike. Does anybody ever walk out of this place? Oh, sure. We get rid of everybody eventually. That's it. You got him! Now, come on. Guard it. Give it to him! You want to talk? Sure. Where's woodlawn? Oh, the suburbs, Baltimore. Oh. Out in all that expensive green, huh? You must have really been some socie in high school. I counted 16 mentions in your yearbook. Yeah, I looked through it. Well, it was fun. Where did you go to school? Oh, western high. All cement. The only grass around got smoked. Two years did me, and I quit. Hmm. You and I are roomies. How did you get here? Oh. They say I'm packing a tumor on my spine. They don't really know. In this freak factory, it pays to have something mysterious going. I mean... Oh. Welfare picks up the tab for all this delightful attention. How did it go for you in p.T.? Oh, I fainted... I think. Well, you're lucky to have Barbara. At least that girl sets goals you can make. Shoot. Shoot! Pretend it's Disneyland. Let's try for the big money, joni. You did it, lady. Thanks. I'll bake some cookies tonight. We'll celebrate. It's snowing. Joni. Gosh, such big flakes. Since tumbleweed's not working for a while, why don't we breed her? A brood mare. I don't want to ruin her form. One foal won't hurt her back. I'll share the money. These pants are too short. Maybe you've stretched. When I leave here, I want to put tumbleweed back on the show circuit. How did you get the folks to stay outside? Threats mostly, and I told them if they came inside, it would spoil the surprise. Oh! Merry Christmas. Fantastic. Oh, a white Christmas. I ordered it. We're off. Now, watch it, Jay. We might skid. Nobody's thinking about driving this close to Christmas. That's your mother's idea of subtlety. Mom, I can't break. I'm already broken. ♪ Oh, come all ye faithful ♪ ♪ joyful and triumphant ♪ ♪ oh, come ye, oh, come ye ♪ ♪ to Bethlehem ♪ ♪ come and behold him ♪ ♪ born the king of angels ♪ ♪ oh, come let US adore him ♪ ♪ oh, come let US adore him ♪ ♪ oh, come let US adore him ♪ ♪ Christ the lord ♪♪ I wrapped the most presents this Christmas. Merry Christmas. The couple with the most points-- the hassle's less here. Everybody's fighting the same battle. Give or take a limb. I like not explaining and re-explaining everything all the time. Yeah. Relatives can be a sharp pain. They treat you like a dummy. Stupid uncle of mine asked if I could still read. Good question. What's the answer? I told him, "no. "Since my legs got paralyzed, my brain did, too." Here they come-- Barbara Walters and Cassius Clay. We're dumping Christmas. We need clean sheets. Can you pull rank and get our bedding changed? That idiot skipped US. Short shifts because of the holiday. It stinks in here! Time for your workout. Hey, Earl, what's going on? Too much sitting up. The bones are starting to rub the skin away. But, Earl... I got to go. Earl, check this out. Is this the ward where some guy sticks his head in and says, "who wants to play baseball?" And we say, "you know we can't do anything below our necks," and he says, "we just want to use you for second base." [Humming] It's really not necessary for US to anesthetize you... Unless of course, you're feeling a bit squeamish. There'll be a certain amount of chiseling on your hip bone. We'll scrape those joints so they won't trouble you. Carve away. Chisel. [Humming] Mallet. [Humming] Cry, honey. Release your feelings. I can't cry. There's nobody around to blow my nose and mop up. I'm here. What about tomorrow? If I cry, I might like it. Then I'd want to do it a lot. Ok, Jon. Maybe you hit it. I do want to push away... The kind of reality you're living right now, these last few months, I've looked at just about every area of my life. Maybe it's because my own faith never really got bumped before. I was sort of retarded back there in junior high somewhere. Now... I'm trying to match it up to a real world... And your pain. God, if I can't die... Show me how to live. Please... If anybody's listening. Hey, lady, you want anything? Diana! I got lonesome. That's somebody's uniform, you nut. It's my little uni. You like it? They are not big for jokes around here. It's just stupid that visitors can't come in before 2:00. They shouldn't interrupt your soap operas. I'm a staff volunteer. I'll be with you part of every day. What about school? I took off a semester. That is absolutely mad. I was undeclared at college. They keep asking those pointed questions. I don't know what I want to do. I've even started asking god if he has anything in mind. I'm open. Until I get a better offer, your wish has been granted. You have your very own personal candy striper. Now let's see-- ratty hair, grungy teeth, and, ooh, dragon breath. Where's your toothpaste? How's that? Ohh. Hi. How's your neck? Mm-hmm. You know, those things will kill you. Can't wait. Mmm. Child, my hair's going to be so tight, it's going to choke my brain, but I love it. Ha ha ha! Dr. Martin Luther King, long a champion of nonviolent causes, was shot today in Memphis, Tennessee. Dr. King had returned to Memphis Wednesday morning by plane to organize support for the 1,300 sanitation workers-- it's like the world's falling apart. Dr. King, as a civil rights leader, advocated nonviolence. Maybe what we got is catching. [Dr. King] It's been a spiritual disaster deepening their despair and hopelessness. Not so tight. You'll get writer's cramp in your jaw. Back to first grade. Why should I have to learn to write with my mouth? It's disgusting. I know I'll get my hands back anyway. What if you don't? He has to do that for me. It went off yesterday. Another drippy night in this sweatbox. Well, you're the last one to gripe. Aren't jungles always hot? Oh, all this stuff cluttering up. Just dust-catchers. We are not personal maids. I'll bet you ain't nobody's personal anything. You got to flip b.J. Nobody's been around since supper. I ought to leave you like this for the morning shift. Not flip you at all. Niggers and hippies, that's all we got here. There's supposed to be two people to flip US. Don't worry about it, honey. You'll never feel a thing. I'm going to report you to the head nurse. You'll be canned. I doubt it. If I could get over there fast enough, I'd break your face. Relax, piccaninny. Hold on, honey. Aah! We saw that! She'll sue. We're witnesses! Good night, ladies. Um, um, um. Hi, Earl. Ohh! Thanks. That feels great. You know, I dream a lot about walking. It helps me to work harder during the day. You going to throw that at me? I want you to draw something on it. You've got to be kidding. Draw something you like. Use these. It won't work. I used to sketch in charcoal. My father's sort of an artist. That was with my hands. The skill, the talent, comes from up here. With a little practice, you'll do as well with your mouth as your hands. Hmm... Oh, my young skin is going. I hope Jay gets here before dick. I asked her to bring some foundation and blush. I guess from now on it comes out of a jar. Oh, you can use some of my stuff, joni. You'll look like you've been cruising the Caribbean. Great. Ok? All right. Mmm... Oh, that feels good. How do I look? You look like one of them high-cheeked ladies in vogue. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! [Bell rings] Happy birthday. [Ring] It's been stuck on three for almost 10 minutes. They can't expect people to walk. Dick, we'd better get out of here. It's moving. It's moving. Oh, let's go. Quick! Whoo! You're going to a party, gal. It's your birthday! Whoo! Try that big piece right there. It's not easy. Joni. Joni. We love you. We love you. Did you do that with your mouth? Daddy, I'm not your little girl anymore. But you're still my girl. They're going to release you soon. We have to make plans. Who said? How do you know? [John eareckson] You know you can always stay in town with mom and me, but Jay's just insisting that you be out on the farm with her. You think about it. Whatever works best. He wants it all. He's got to pass silverman. Tied! Over here. Ok, take off the cover. Is that me? Maybe you can use it to cover up a crack somewhere. You ain't never seem me looking that classy. Thank you. I wonder if I can get welfare to get me one of these power jobs. With your driving record? You know, I hear one out of seven don't make it when they leave here. They let them come back? No, they find out a way to drop out permanently. Hey, look what's up ahead. Mmm, mmm, mmm. How did that dame make days? I thought she only came out at night. Hold on to my picture. I'm going to get me a vampire in white. Wait a minute. I am so sorry. Oh... Oh, I bet you're sorry. You've been plotting this for months. I hit overdrive when I should have braked. What you should be doing, little black girl, is swinging through the trees, not driving one of those things. Well, if it had to happen I'm glad it happened in a hospital. Hi, Barb. I felt my hand tingling again last night. I kept waking up. I never like goodbyes, so one of these mornings I'll just be gone. Have you got a little time, joni? We can talk. Incredible. Nobody's asked me if I had the time for nearly two years. I thank you for that, Barb, and for a lot of other things, too. I couldn't have made it without you. I'm a physical therapist, joni. My specialty is quads, that's why you and I met. God or blind fate didn't put you into that chair, you did it yourself. In school they called it the gunshot, diving, motorcycle syndrome. Am I supposed to ask what that means? I guess I'm going to tell you anyway. Very physical kinds of people, before their accidents, uh... Athletic, courting danger, chancy kinds of things. I have three patients right now who were crippled on motorcycles. They spend every waking minute dreaming of how they're going to ride again. Why do I have to listen to this? You haven't listened until now. I have a right to privacy, even in this zoo. Would you get this? Joni... I know you're not paranoid, and you don't see life in a distorted way, but... If you leave here consciously saying "I know," and it's only lip service... Then... I will have failed you in the worst possible way. You will never use these fingers... To comb your hair... Or to put on your own lipstick... Or to drive a car. Never. Then I don't want to go home. Not without my hands. I've already conceded the fact that I'm going to sit down for the rest of my life. But without my hands I'm a helpless freak. You were the one who said work hard so I could be rehabilitated. You just wanted me out of here so somebody else could have my bed. Not true. No miracles, huh? Nope. We can still call it off. Just say the word. No ghosts, dad. Ok? Sure. [Horse neighs] Tumbleweed's too good to be put out to pasture. It's the ghosts that get to you. Right. [Chopping noises] Hey, Jay? Yeah? Who's that kid out there? Diana sent him over. He needed a summer job. Steve something. I thought he could help take some of the chores off dad. He's going to kill himself with that ax. Hey! Di, what's the idea? You've graduated, ok? You can't live inside a stupid yearbook. Who are you to decide what's best for me? Unfortunately, I care a lot. Best friends get stuck with that emotional garbage. I didn't ask you to care. Don't you take my book. Don't you dare! I'll keep it for you. Di, please don't. Come back. I'm sorry. Di! Aah! Ok. Now's a great time. There's nobody around but you and me. [Glass breaking] Morning, miss eareckson. Good morning. I'm just waiting for your dad. We're going to work on the roof today. It's joni, ok? I may look it, but I don't feel that old. Sure, joni. What's so good that you have to read it on the roof? I like Isaiah. "They that wait upon the lord "shall renew their strength. "They shall mount up with wings as eagles. "They shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." Well, that's very poetic. Hey, he's talking about spiritual running and walking, not just feet. Obviously. You do a good job, son. You're careful, and you get things done right. Where did Diana find him anyway? I think he spoke at their church. He's a Bible-thumper. Yeah. Well, his dad's a preacher. You're kidding. What church? I don't know. A street preacher, maybe. Diana said something about a Van. A Van? Terrific. I can see the two of them on some corner with a tambourine-- passing out little leaflets with pictures of the devil and scotch bottles. "Where will you spend eternity?" We're being snobs. If I were back in school, he wouldn't exist. Diana says that you were a champion wrestler, Mr. Eareckson. At one time, I could beat a man twice my weight. I tried out for the junior team last year. But I bombed out. You want to talk about it? I'm a good listener. I just wish I... I looked more on the outside like I feel on the inside. Maybe I could show you a few things. Hey! How are you doing? I'm stuck. How did you do that? You look good. Hi. Hi is the best you can do? What's wrong with hi? A nickel for your thoughts. A nickel for your thoughts. Old times are really old. You can grow up together and still grow apart. Jon... I really believe god gives only good gifts. If he wants US to marry, then we can handle whatever's up ahead. Maybe I'd feel this way even if I wasn't in a wheelchair. Life changes people. You see it in the movies, old lovers, forever friends. I'll never change the way I feel. [Horn honks] Who's that? It's di. Yell that we're down here. I'm not that crazy to see her. Hey, di! Hi, Jay. What happened with you guys? Hey! What are you doing? Hey, you guys. I think I met a man in my life this morning. Who? Frank mood. There's only one problem. He was riding a horse. The league of Maryland horsemen is having a trail ride. He asked me to go with him. The thing is, I've never been on anything higher than a pony, and it was nearly dead. I have to be really horsy by this weekend. What are the odds? 1, 2, 3. There we go. Don't they come in a smaller size? You'll do all right. Hyah! Aah! It's revenge! Let her walk him first. Wait! Horse! Aah! What do I do? Sit up straight. Pull back on his reins. Those trail rides, they last three to four hours. Ohh. They've got some great sweaters on sale at the mall. We'll go there first and then get something to eat. There's dad's new project. In motion. Did you meet a girl or something? Huh? You are going for instant Steve McQueen. Senior year. Going out in a Blaze of glory. I had a good time in high school. Did you really have a street meeting outside the school with all the kids watching? Yeah. They threw pennies. You're going to have a heart attack! Woo! Woo-hoo! Well... Oh, great! Hey, lead it into the wind. My life is like that. Full of ups and downs. What--what was god supposed to do, suspend the law of gravity just for you? Well, he's supposed to have a lot of angels hanging around. Couldn't he have spared just one to soften the impact? If you could just peel this back, almost everybody's looking for him... One way or another. It's just that we want him on our terms. The great vending machine in the sky. Well, how's he with questions? You got to go the distance yourself, Jon. This is your Bible. Aren't you going to be lost without it? Hey, it's all in there, Jon. Just be open. Did you come here this summer for a crack at me? Ha ha ha. I don't need the aggravation. What have you got here? Oh. It's Steve's. He left it. You've already got three. Well, this one's all marked up. The important parts. "We can see and understand "only a little about god now, "as if we were peering at his reflection "in a pool or mirror. "But someday, we're going to see him "in his completeness, face to face. "I know how foolish it sounds "to those who are lost, "when they hear that Jesus died to save them, "for god in his wisdom "saw to it that the world would never find him "through human brilliance. "And god in his weakness, "Christ dying on the cross, "is far stronger than any man. "But someone may ask, how will the dead be brought back to life again? "What kind of bodies will they have? "When you put a seed into the ground, "it doesn't grow into a plant "until it dies first. "And when a green shoot "comes up out of the seed, "it is different from the seed you've planted. "And just as there are different kinds "of seeds and plants, "so there are also "different kinds of flesh. "The angels in heaven "have bodies far different from ours. "And the beauty and glory of their bodies "is different "from the beauty and glory of ours. "But all who become Christ's "will have the same kind of body as his. "I tell you this, my brothers. An--" "An earthly body made of flesh and blood "cannot get into god's kingdom. "These perishable bodies of ours are not the right kind to live forever." Ok, lord. I'll stop trying to work it out to make sense just for me. Whatever surprises you have in store... Or no surprises at all. I guess it's up to you. And help me not to get in the way too much. What are you doing? Just talking. Shut up and go to sleep. [Joni] Thank you, father, that you let Steve touch my life. To lead me into your word. There's purpose in that. [Wedding march plays] Can I have your attention at the end there? Look over here, please. Ready? Say cheese. Here we go. Ready? There we go. Can we go over there? Sure. Wake up. You've got a visitor. A what? A who. Claims it's by invitation. This is crazy. Good morning. He's in the living room. You! I hope I'm not too early. Uh...for what? Well, you said come by anytime. Your exact words. I wrote them down. Mmm. Help. Um... I remember I met you at the wedding, and you made me laugh, but I've forgotten your name. Don. Bertolli. With, uh, two ls. Two ls. By the way, you look radiant. Coffee? Great. Yes. Please. Hey, great morning for a ride. Where? Around. Just a ride. Anywhere. How about Florida? There's quite a routine getting me in and out of the car. You can teach me. Jon? You'll find out my weight. You're light as a feather. Joni? You ever been to pimlico? Uh, sure. The preakness. I'm into a different kind of race. Can't you feel anything? Well, not in my legs or in my hands, but in my arms, it sort of feels like... You know when your foot's asleep? Why can't you be fixed? Uh... I can't. Hi. Hi. My guys. Mmm. Hi, Jay. How was it? Oh...terrific. Great. Can I do it? Ohh! You're heavier coming back. Must be all that pizza laying there. You all right? Just fix my feet. Ok. Thanks. I had a really great time. Me, too. Hey! Wait up a minute! You don't have a license for this road. Come on! Go, go, go! No roadblocks. Hey, come here. Next time you need bread, come to me first. Ok. Joni, this is Bernie. Hi, joni. I guess it was pretty bad in there. It was murder. Let's go, then. "We who believe "are carefully joined together with Christ "as parts of a beautiful, constantly growing temple for god." [Honks horn] [Honk honk] [Honk] I've been waiting here all afternoon. You said 2:00. Now, uh... Hold on a minute there. Nobody's signed anything yet. Right. My days are awful full, Jon. That's how it is. You act like you're allergic or something. He's pushy. He's pushing you, and I can't figure why. That's the world he comes from. When he wants something, he just goes for it. Can I have some coffee? I thought you settled all that with dick. Settled? You mean, like a nun? Come on, Jon! You know, there's more to romance... Than what happens below the neck. All i'm trying to say is how often are you willing to get hurt? This paper's been soaking all night. Can you set it up? He's strong. And if it can happen... Don could handle it. Joni... The feelings and the rush and the words are easy. Dick had all the words. Well, I got to free you up sometime. [Horn honks] [Honk honk honk] It's di. Hey! I bet she's pregnant. Hey. Look what came special delivery. I feel like tinker bell just before her wand lights up. First prize. I entered it last month. Did you tell them I did it with my mouth? Hey, they don't know you from Norman Rockwell. But you won. In there. Now this note here, and--oh! Magic fingers, if you could do your stuff. It's supposed to be an augmented chord. Jon, why don't we forget all the pat answers and arguments and just ask him? For what? Well, Jesus said, "ask whatever you will in my name, and I'll give it to you." But... Hey. I've got enough faith for the both of US. Don, you got a minute? Sure. What's up, man? You know, I'm not some big bad wolf. I'm not going to hurt her. You won't mean to. I know the lord put joni and me together for some good reason. For marriage? I wish the lord would let me in on it. You can't protect her forever, Jay. Do you ever dream? When I sleep sometimes. I mean when you're awake. Do you ever dream about me? You are a very egotistical person. You ever dream about US? US really together? All the time. Some kinds of dreaming I gave up... For my health. It could work. Someplace small. Everything compact, easy to handle. I wouldn't want to lay too much stress on doing dishes and stuff. And what do we do once we have that place all spick-and-span? We'd have to go to bed. Sometime. And... Well... What about kids? What about them? I'd like to spend a lifetime learning to love you. I've already started. Don't say that unless you're very sure that you mean it. Oh, and please mean it. I've got to do something different. How about caramel apples? Yeah. That's-- that's a good idea. We could have caramel apples and fudge. [Joni] I know that miracles can happen when we belong to you. Let this be my time. When I was in the hospital, this guy stormed into my room and grabbed my arm. And he prayed over me loud and long. I'll never forget his face. "God heal this woman." Oh, I got a spasm and started shaking. I thought then I was healed. That was when you were young. You say how god sent Steve to help you grow. This could be your next step of faith. What about the verse saying it's god's will for you to be whole. Well, physically it's impossible. My spinal cord is severed. He would have to do it. "Is anyone among you suffering... "And is anyone sick... "They shall pray... "Calling upon the lord to heal him. "And his prayer, if offered in faith... Will heal him." Jon, I believe it's god's will that you'll be healed. Dear lord... We acknowledge that yours is the power to do all things. And joni and I have faith, father. Faith in your word when it says that all things are possible for them that believe. Father... In the name of our lord Jesus Christ I ask you to heal joni so that we may serve you together in your kingdom. Amen. Maybe it doesn't happen right away. I'll call you. Sure. He hasn't called. Hmm. He hasn't come by in a week. You don't ever want to talk about it, right? Maybe in 20 years. [Joni] I keep telling my hands and fingers to move. They're not getting the message. I thought you would glorify yourself, lord, by putting me on my feet. I know I believed enough. I really did. You must have something else in mind. And I will trust you... For whatever's around the corner. I am in too far to back out now. Jay? Oh, Jay. What? Come here. Oh, come here quick. What's up? All my stuff is gone. Dad's got it in his head you're going to have an exhibit. An exhibit? Has everybody gone nuts in this family? What idiot's going to give me an exhibit? Dad's found one somewhere. ♪ In the wintertime ♪ ♪ for underwear ♪ ♪ for underwear... ♪♪ Oh, I hope nobody comes. The idea of a lot of strangers poking and staring. It's only lunch. Hey, listen. So you don't start screaming when we get inside, I priced everything. You what? You mean they're not just looking? They're supposed to buy? Push me in front of a truck. Please. [Piano plays] This is Adam wertz, eyewitness news. We're here with the father of joni eareckson, a local artist who also happens to be a quadrapeligic. Mr. Eareckson, when did joni first begin to paint? My daughter's accident happened when she was 17, and afterwards, as part of therapy, she got into the artwork. What beautiful roses! Aren't they? They're from the mayor! Can you imagine? I don't know about this. Joni, look. There's your dad. Oh, no! I can't go in there. Well, we'll go in here. When I get back my hands I'm going to strangle you two. Joni, what do you have to say to all the folks watching wjz eyewitness news? Um... Not much. Are these roses a gift from your father? Yes-- I mean no! They're from the mayor? From the mayor. Sorry. We're enjoying this whole thing. Yeah, so am I. This is Adam wertz, wjz eyewitness news. Oh. What is it, hon? I thought Don would be here. I haven't seen him. Daddy, this is great. We're so proud of you. What's the tab so far? Almost $1,000. If the exhibit stays a week, they'll all go. It's your party, hon. Been a long time coming. Why do they do it? Don't be so slow. You're good. A couple that had gotten back from Europe were arguing over what room they'd hang you in. The bathroom. I like this best. Is that you? It was. Would you please pull off that price tag? It's not for sale. 125 bucks? Well, my friends try a little hard sometimes. I want to know how you managed. Uh, what? Um... I could give you the reader's digest version right here, lieutenant, or we could find a table if you want to listen. You'll have to push. Excuse me. When did you get out of high school? Uh...'67. Yeah? Me, too. They never told US about this in senior problems. No, they sure didn't. At our school they called it contemporary issues of the social sciences. Exactly. There are a million questions and only a couple of decent answers in life. Half the guys in my class went to college. The other half went to nam. Some lived, some died... Some of US... Got caught in the cracks. No one ever told US the world is an outhouse, did they? I am sure of only one thing-- I know who put me back together. How can you know? I sleep nights, and I laugh a lot. Look... If there really is such a place as heaven and if Jesus really died on that cross because he wanted to bridge the gap between god and US... Then getting to know him and all that that means, well, it should be worth looking into, even for you. You see, I'd rather be in this chair... Knowing him... Than on my feet without him. And I never really knew that for sure until this moment. Self-delusion or... Whatever... You'd win my vote. Would you take me back, please? Oh, no! It's ok. Joni... Please, Jay. Hi. Hi. Hi, Jay. I saw you on the 6:00 news. I was really proud of you. Yeah, well, it was ok, but i'd never want to do it again. I need you to know how it is with me. I'm pretty sure I know. Please don't put words around it. Joni... Joni, I heard about this job up north. They needed a youth director. It's a big camp, and I went for it. Terrific. When do you go? Tonight. They wanted me right away. I do better with kids. Can I ask you something crazy before you go off to bigger and better things? Sure. When you touched me, what was going on? Some sort of character test or experiment? No. Joni, kissing you and touching you and sharing your life was everything it should have been. It was beautiful. You're the most attractive woman I know. It just wasn't enough when the hard stuff started? Jon... I thought I had god all figured out. You know, in a nice, neat little package. Boy, for a guy loaded with answers, I'm just full up to here with questions. He didn't do it our way. I'm off balance right now. I'm really off balance. Jon, I want to leave as your friend. Lots of pins knocked out, but as your friend. The kids at that youth camp are really lucky to get you. I'm ok. I can still feel. And I guess I'm alive. I just want to be alone for a while. You know, someone once asked me how I managed it-- getting my life together. At the time, I couldn't say much more than... "Jesus had done it." I didn't know much about the Bible then, but... I did feel that god had taken all the... The broken pieces of my life... And he made something... Beautiful. And today, I know... That the lord is... Creating something in me that I could never create for myself. Oh, but that is not to say that I understand all the whys. But, um... I know who holds the answers, and...i can wait. But I want to be right up front with you: You don’t have to break your neck to find god. I think that suffering can push the search along and our priorities get rearranged. But I imagine most of you would catch on a lot faster than I did. I had to get past myself before I could see that handicaps come at US in all shapes and sizes. Broken homes... Broken hearts... Anxiety feelings that threaten to take over, burdens of doubt, a... A deep aloneness... And the confines of your soul may seem as limiting as... Well...a wheelchair. I know that feeling. But... I also know that Jesus stayed on the cross to heal US. And when I think of Jesus paralyzed on that cross simply because he loved me, even when I couldn't have cared less about him, I know that I have discovered something... Priceless. But trusting Christ is not necessarily having trustful feelings. It’s an act of the will. We need to believe it. To believe Jesus really can forgive US and then lay our sin and brokenness at his feet. And receive that spiritual healing that will start US on a great eternal journey. I started that journey as a high school sophomore. I believed my grades would go up, homework would be less boring, i’d be more popular. It didn’t exactly work out that way. To follow Christ may cost you something. You may be asked to fellowship in his suffering. But when I look back on my own experience I can promise you over and over again that you will see and feel and touch his sustaining power. Heaven will be... Heavenly because god will give US new minds and... And new bodies. And the Bible promises US that we will enjoy him forever. And I can't wait. I intend to stand before the lord with legs that walk and arms and hands that work and lift them high and shout out before the whole universe that Jesus Christ is who he claims to be, and that he is the very son of god. And that is only the beginning. If I... Hadn't decided to go swimming in the chesapeake bay on that hot July day back in 1967... I know I wouldn't be sitting here speaking to you about the glory of god... But I am.
