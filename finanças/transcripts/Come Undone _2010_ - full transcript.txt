- Hello? - I need to get to the hospital. Isa? What time is it? God. Don't panic. We're on our way. No, don't move! Wait till we get there. Ale! Ale, wake up! The water broke. No, I mended the radiator. No, it's Isa! We need to get her to the hospital. Vincenzo's away. What time is it? Get up! Why is Vincenzo away? - Put your watch on. Your shoes... - Hold on. - How long will it take? - Not long. - How long? - Five minutes. Hell's bells! My car's at the garage. Let's take yours. Are you nuts? She's as big as a hot air balloon. She can't stretch out in mine. Let's ask Bruno. At this hour? Come on. He's used to it. It's 4:00 AM! It's an emergency. The poor things... It's coming again! Deep breaths. We'll time them. Want to use the meter? Faster, Bruno! Cut it out, Isa. She's pulling me! - Get this thing off of me. - 20 seconds. When do I stop? Time between contractions! - How should I know? - Faster! I've driven women to the maternity before! You have? I could call this cab Stork 51! - It's easing off. - Do I time it? Do it! I knew this would happen. I even told Vincenzo it would. - What a shithead! - He has to work. You're defending him? - Watch the road! - I am! Come on, push hard. Here he comes. Push hard! Here he comes. That's it! Good! That's great! Here he is! Hi, kiddo. Let's go see Mom, okay? Wrap him up nice and warm. You're with your mom now. COME UNDONE Antonio. He's so tiny, it's scary. You were there all night? - You saw him born? - I cut the umbilical cord. Wow! I couldn't. I didn't think I could, but you overcome all that. Unless you faint first. It'd be too big a shock for me. But what do I know? My maternal instinct is below zero. You should have seen Isa when she touched him. - She seemed so different. - Yeah? I nearly forgot. Sign the card for Eliana. We all have. - Who wrote it? - Carla. "No more balancing loss and profit. What awaits is a trip to Egypt." What can I say? I wasn't expecting this. Thank you. Collect the ticket and you're off. - Gone with the wind! - Good choice? Lovely, but I've never traveled alone before. I'll come with you. Two tickets, sir. - A man would be better. - Here's to Eliana. What am I, transparent? I'm sorry. - Just a second. - Thank you. What will I do with my three radio alarms? Throw them out. Come on, you're retiring, not going to jail. Caught for you last night. Am I forgiven? You're a fisherman, too? This is a personal gift from me. - This is embarrassing. - Open it. Oh, Lord! You won't forget me now. - How are you feeling? - I'm beat. You? Believe it or not, the store gate broke today. You went in? I waited for you. - I got these. - Beautiful. Will they do? Hi, Aunt Ines. They don't allow flowers in the room now. Your mother and the mother-in-law... You could have let me know. - I did, 10 minutes after his birth. - Exactly. What a sweet baby! He's changed already. He's just like Vincenzo as a baby. Mom, didn't I have a pear-shaped head? I see Pino in him. I was blond, believe it or not. They're all ugly for the first year. So you say. Auntie's turn. Perfect. You did the prenatal class too? The way things went, maybe she should have. I had to work. I'll pay for this for the next 10 years. Anna. We're home. Was I asleep? Like a marmot. Let's go. Let's give the chicken another minute. Give me that. I never imagined it was like that. What? Being born. Like what? So violent. Yeah, when you came back out you looked... Devastated. Let's hope Isa stays calm for a while. I told her to keep away from the laundry for three months. Mom and Aunt Ines can manage. But she's stubborn. Poor Antonio. What about us? How do you mean? If you want, I'm ready. I know that... you're not sure yet... Let's pretend I didn't say that. Where is it? Wasn't it here? I think it was over there. Can you open it? This evening... how about a pizza with Mauro and Serena? They keep complaining we never see them. If you want, I'll get off the pill. You're getting good. - I am? - You bet! I enjoy it. I have fun. I look forward to Tuesdays. This is Sadice. You started it there. When was it? November. We should go more often. I wish. We never go. Tea? Herb tea. I'm wired enough as it is. Why? What's up? I'll be at home all August without a day's paid vacation. No! That really sucks! They more or less fire me on July 30th and rehire me on September 1st. Nice, huh? Shall I go? It's Bruno. Here I am. Hi, baby. Free until tomorrow at 2:00. - The Maldives? - I'd prefer a pizza. Hi, Anna. - Alessio? - Working in the bathroom. I'll go on in. - Bruno! - Alessio! Man at work! Come in. Nearly done. Beautiful! And the shower? This one cost 139 Euros. Those crooks wanted 99 Euros for delivery and installation. They don't know you. And the screws are missing. Could you take a look at this? A portable record player. Let's see. Can you do it by Sunday? I don't know. I'll need to open it up. A couple is about to do it for the first time. The guy has a tiny dick, so he turns the light off and puts it in her hand. And she says, "No thanks, I don't smoke." Who told you that one? A client? A female client! - A female one? Wow! - People are crazy. It's fantastic! Look. Look. - That one. - This one? You're right, it's not bad. Try out time? Come on, strip. - I already put the pasta on! - So? - It'll get mushy. - Let it. We've had it mushy before. It's cold! This is great! No curtain sticking to you. - Seen my stapler? - No. If a vase falls off your balcony or if your husband has a skiing accident, you're covered. I should have known. If you need me, call me on my cell after 3:30. The statement's ready. I'm free tomorrow. We'll look at it then. Return flight, four-star hotel, three days, full board, all for 279 Euros? Fantastic! I'll send my mom... permanently. - Why don't you go? - Are you crazy? I want to be alone at home. Without the mortgage to pay, I'd go. I have a mortgage too, but you can't stop living for the next 20 years. Working girls. The catering guy is here for a knife. - I'll go, I've finished. - It's right here. Did I interrupt your merry picnic? - What did Mommy make you? - Osso bucco? No, stew today. I surrender. You again. The shrimp fisherman. We're short of staff with the recession. - Here you go. - Thanks. Compliment the chef on the Bavarian cream. He'll be pleased. He did good for an Egyptian. There you are. The terminals were all down. - That bank's useless. - Hi. - Did you eat already? - They're in there. I'll join them. I'm starving. - You were eating? - I'm done. Fancy a coffee? Two even, but I'm double parked. Let me give you... Give me that. Let me give you our card. You never know... you might need us again. Thanks. - Goodbye. - See you. Right. Carnival. Carnival whistles. The Rio Carnival! Ale! The band. Dancing. A party! A gate. An open gate. - Time's up! - Gate crashing a party. You're useless at this, Bruno! - All set? - Yeah. Wow, I'm sweating. Peak. Mountain. Top. Winning. Trophy. Prize. Top prize! - What? - Top prize. See how to do it now? Slice. Orange. Moon! Time! Face. Round. Full moon! Wiped the floor with you! What a joke. In any case, I won't ever be your partner again. Never! We lose. The drinks are on us. You're welcome. How's your sister? Good. She's calmed down. - She's nursing him? - Yes. That's good. She's lucky. One of my colleagues goes to Switzerland for formula. It's half price there. Is that what's stopping you? You mean... from having a baby? - What'll we have? - A margarita. - What do they want? - God knows. You're the smart one. Patchouli? No, Mysore sandalwood. - I'll remember that. - Please do. Come in. Stefania is wiping me out. I'm too old for tennis. It's better than kendo. - You said it. - Ready. There was a message on my voice-mail from a certain Sainati. Ring a bell? Wasn't he a partner in Stal & Stal? We insured him until how long ago? Six or seven years, I'd say. Want me to check? Thanks. Was there ever a problem? No. If I remember correctly, a Swiss multinational took them over. You're something else. A real phenomenon. Thanks, boss. Fair trade candy boxes. Stefania's driving me nuts. When are you calling Sainati? - I should have already. - Okay, no problem. How about that coffee? The woman with the knife. If I'm not careful, I'll be darning his socks soon. You have a text message. Thanks. Listen to this. "Sometimes, a moment is all it takes to forget a lifetime. But sometimes a lifetime isn't enough to forget a moment." Beautiful, huh? It's pretty weird though. He was over 6' tall and apparently his grave is shorter. If we ever go to Paris, I want to go to P?re Lachaise. Where? P?re Lachaise. Jim Morrison is buried in the P?re Lachaise cemetery. I know, it's in Paris. Good evening. Hello. May I? Go ahead. What would you like? - I'm waiting for someone. - Okay. Actually, I'll have a glass of wine. - Right away. - White. Excuse me. Forget it, okay? Oh my God. - I'm sorry. - Hi. Here I am. - You were leaving? - No. I just forgot to send off an e-mail message. Well, if you're busy... I have to fly back to the office. I can't fly, but I can come with you. This way. - Did I hurt you? - It's nothing. The northern city woman's usual pace. - Are you from here? - More or less. And you? Guess. The south. That's kinda vague. - Apulia? - Water. Calabria? Filadelfia. Filadelfia? Filadelfia, in the province of "Valencia." Vibo Valentia, not like Valencia in Spain. Saudi Calabria. - I don't hear the Arab accent. - I lost it. I've been here since I was 16. They sent me here to work with my brother. I'm supposed to handle stock and transport but I do everything. If we're a waiter short, I fill in. At least you don't get bored. Why? Do you? No, I like my job. I like numbers. They help me relax. Lucky you. I've never gotten on with numbers. No? We've never been friends. I'll only be a minute. No sweat. Madame, champagne. Are you crazy? That's my boss's. A client gave it to him. I'm afraid it eez open now. Too late. Zee olives is finished an' ze leetle nuts too. Sorry. After Calabria, you moved to France? Ze Mediterran?e. Olives, voil?. Very well 'idden. Planning to fool around much longer? Who's there? Is someone here? Carla, it's me! Anna. Carla. God, Anna. - You scared me. - I'm sorry. I forgot to send an e-mail. What's up? - Are you okay? - Sure. I just got here and I was doing a stretching exercise for my back. Why are you here? Forget it, okay? Mom's bugging me more than usual, so sometimes I come here at night... - to chat online. - Good idea. I need a glass of water. Wait. Sit yourself down. Don't move. I have a surprise. Stay there. I'll be right back! What do I do? - You have to leave. - How? I'll distract her and you sneak out. Happy hour! But that's... Morini's. Who cares? I'll buy him another. Are you drunk? It costs a bomb. I thought... we deserved a drink, right? A great accounting team like us? Know what? You're right. We make a great team! Cheers! Have a drop more. We don't do this every day. It's good. It's champagne. Domenico. Where are you? Listen, I have a wife and two kids. Let's forget everything. I understand. It's better for me too. Can you manage it all? Trying to behead me, Teo? Dad bought it. Like it? - Beautiful. - It's like real. I'm so sorry. Don't worry. Let's go, Teo. - Have a good evening. - You too. Press the soil down well. Who's that? Bianca said they might stop by. How did it go? Lots of people, not many sales. It's the recession. - Can I get a glass of water? - Sure. There was a new stall. I got this for our herb tea. - Thanks. - Do you like it? Cute, huh? - It's beautiful! Look. - Great. Bruno, there's nothing I can do. Okay, at least we tried. You're the best, man! He's the biggest! I'm light as a feather. - Here you go. - That's too much. - The ventilator too. - You sold it? - You bet. - Fantastic! - We should start a company. - Called? Bonoldi & De Francesco, Inc. - Great. - Perfect. - This part is a bit messy. - I think so too. Work on the sky and we'll see later. Counselor, - it's too much. - I need to lighten up. Gently or you'll ruin the knife. Lele, what are you up to? The details... - Always come last. - Good boy. Interesting, Isa. Good motion. There you go. The changing mat fits perfectly. Just keep an eye on this leg here. You're a genius. Sure, the new Leonardo Da Vinci. I'm going to burst. I should eat for two but I eat for four here. It suits you, right? No way! Fuck! Are you crazy? I'm trying to get him to sleep! Sorry, honey, I'll do it. There are these too. The machine's full. I'll do them by hand. Want one? No, Auntie, you know I quit. Everything okay? Sure. - Take this. - No, Auntie. Take it or it'll all go to smokes. Thanks. I'll go do my duty or your mom will get mad. Sorry. Traffic's pretty heavy. I just got here. - Hungry? - How are you? Good. And you? Happy to see you. How long do you have? 45 minutes, more or less. Shall we go? Where? Outside. Don't you have a place? No. I live with someone. It would be good to be together, somewhere quiet. But where? Don't you know anyone? No one I could ask. When could you? I don't know. I go to the pool on Wednesdays. Two hours in the evening. Wednesday? I'll call you. The Spaniards were bad enough, but now the Portuguese say Columbus was born in Portugal. Listen, on Wednesday I'll be stuck in the office. Meaning? We're behind on a load of files we need to finish. I won't be home till late. How late? Late. It has to be Wednesday? We see Bianca and Bruno on Wednesdays. I know. I'm sorry, but I couldn't refuse. What a drag! - Maybe Thursday can work. - Sure. With Bruno's shifts? - Been here long? - No, five minutes. We have to drive in. Sorry. No problem. Good evening. Your ID, please. It's 50 Euros for the first four hours. Let me. Why? Room 112. - And our ID? - On the way out. 106. 109. What a drag! No vampires here anyhow... with all these mirrors. Right. Wait. Wait. Where the hell is it? I should be going now. Yes, me too. Hi, everyone! Hi, missy. Look, Daddy! This is where it breathes. - Who gave you this? - Gino. - Who's Gino? - The supermarket fishmonger. Do you like it? Very much. How goes? It's been non-stop. Someone turned up at 6:00 for a full facial. Enough blackheads to make an elephant. Want me to put the water on? No, Mom made us stuffed zucchini. Agnese, it goes off in five minutes. No, please, Daddy. It's late. You can finish watching tomorrow. I'll be in the bathroom. Agnese! Here you go. Daddy, what kind of fish would you like to be? - I don't know. - Come on. A dolphin. That's a mammal. Finish brushing your teeth. It's late. Let me wash him, he has pasta everywhere. That's gross! Look at the mess he's in. I must be dreaming! You emptied your pool bag? See? There's hope after all. I made it. Thank God, the shot wiped him out. He had a shot? Don't you remember? Against meningitis. 67 Euros. - Aren't shots free? - Not the optional ones. I paid the kindergarten cafeteria, too. Listen. Don't get mad, okay, but can't you get an advance? An advance? Don't you get it? It's a bad time. It's always a bad time. I work for a bitch. You know that. Yeah, you get them all. Forget it, okay. Franco said he keeps me on part-time as a favor. Shit. You work six hours a day. All the customers want you. What a joke. We'll be in the red soon. My folks help enough. I know. Daddy, can I do ballet too? Like who? Who does ballet? Dani. Mommy told me to ask you. Come here. Please? Luca, your knife's slipping, damn it! What's wrong? Ahmed, how long? 10 minutes, Mimmo. It's veal, not mutton. I know! Jose? We need red seat covers today. Okay. ...then we can work out options according to what you want. All right, I'll be expecting your call. Goodbye. Excuse me, could I have a word with you? Walk with me, I'm late. I have an appointment at noon. The thing is, ma'am, things are hard this month, so could you... Honey, things are hard every month for you. It's not easy asking, you know. You know what my father used to say? "Asking is easy. The worst you can get is a no." I never put you on nights, I turn a blind eye when you're late but I can't do more than that. I'm sorry. Do a good job. Check the tablecloths. They weren't pleased the other week. Screw you. - You work here now, too? - Uncle Mimmo! - You've grown so much! - Tell him that. - She's a real lady now. - Sure. - You see her once a year. - Don't exaggerate. How are you? I'm okay. - How are my little cousins? - Great. They're growing. Coming! I'm going, Dad. Bye, Uncle. Home by 9:30, okay? But we're seeing a movie. You said 10:30. - 10:30? - Yes. Come on, Dad, please? - Have her home by 10:15! - Okay. - Her boyfriend? - She says no. How's Rita? Good? The usual. Let me help. What is it, Mimmo? You didn't come just to say hi. Why so aggressive? Because I know you and I know you're in trouble. No trouble. I'm just a bit... - hard up. - So what's new? Thanks for cheering me up. I don't do cheering up. Three months here wore you out. No, you wore me out. And you work for some shit instead of your brother. I prefer that. - Are you closed? - Not yet. Do you have "Kundalini Yoga"? Yes. Five Euros, please. How much do you need? 300. Here. Fuck you, Santino. Fuck you! I promised I'd help him to mend the gutters. My sister says it's all he talks about. Ale, I forgot the wipes. I'll be right back. - Don't take long. - Okay. We're closing shortly. Would customers please proceed to checkout. Thank you and... Hello? Have you vanished? Are you dead? No, I wanted to see if you cared about me. Do you care? Of course I care. You could have called, too. I've been waiting all damn day. Sorry, I didn't mean to get you mad. I want to see you. Me too. Where are you? At the supermarket. I have to go now. What took so long? Sorry, I couldn't find them. Okay, no big deal. 74 Euros, 50 cents. Want me to see if I have change? - How much do you need? - 50 cents. This never happened to me before. Me neither. Where were you? At Bruno's. I saw you from the window. - Did you see that? - Yes. Try it on. Someone's bought the place next door. Who? I don't know. I heard them visiting. Perfect. Try walking in it. How is it? It's great. See? They'd have charged you 10 Euros to mend it in a store, and they wouldn't have done as good a job. - Have you eaten? - I waited for you. There's spinach and cutlets in the fridge. I already got everything out. And the oven's hot, too. I'll take a shower. I'm beat. Are they paying you overtime at least? I don't know. - What's up? - Ciro fell out of bed. - Is he hurt? - He doesn't want ice. Close the door, Agnese. What happened? Maybe if you got here earlier... Sorry, the coach ran over by a half-hour. You always have an excuse! - Cut it out, will you? - Calm down! Look what she did in the bathroom! What have you done now? I wanted to make a storm. You used all the paper. I tried to dry it up. You tried. Always causing trouble. You can't use that. It's already dirty. Go help Mom now. Go on. Good night. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm beat. You're worried about money? A bit. But we got a credit line. We have to pay it back though. Eliana! Anna, dear, how are you? You cut your hair. It's beautiful. You look fabulous. You'll never guess what happened. I have to thank you. Without that cruise... - What happened? - I'm in love. Really? It's crazy, we're moving in together. After I swore off men forever! - Where did you meet? - On a mule ride in Luxor. His name's Dino. A widower, with married children. Perfect! So how are you? I'm good too, I guess. I have to go. My train's at 6:00. I'll stop by to see you all when I get back. Take care. If the client takes the policy or not? Yes, the policy doesn't matter. Before, a business card was enough, but now we have to fill out a form? It's a drag for us. It's complicated. Even psychologically, it seems like a bad idea. It's the new government ruling. When do we fit in the 30 hours of training? Excuse me, I need to step outside. I'll be right back. What a surprise! What's wrong? I have to go to the pool tomorrow. Why? Miriam's bringing Agnese to watch. How come? Agnese always wanted to come. And the other day, Miriam found my dry robe. She guessed? Maybe. I don't know. Not until next Wednesday then? Two weeks without meeting? Don't do this. What can I do? Nothing. Think I'm happy about this? If you cared, you'd make something up. Like what? Anything. We launch the new program next month and a technician will be here at first to help you out. Can I book him now? I just got used to the old program. Won't it be simpler? Yes, he and Maurizio developed it to suit our needs. Anna. Are you with us? I'm sorry. What about file transfer? Hi, Mom. You made it here. I'm glad. Here. I'd have left it with Mom but even a baby can't keep you home. Give me a break, will you? He's two months old. Hi, Auntie. Heavens above! What's wrong? Those two again? No, just a shitty day. Work problems? Agnese! Get down. Daddy! See the pediatrician. He's really pale. Tomorrow. Bye, beauty. - Bye, Grandpa. - Come here, precious. - What do you say? - Go, Inter! - Take care. - Let's go. See you tomorrow. Daddy, is it true sharks are blind? How can they tell a whale from a tiny fish? I don't know. Poor sharks. Well, poor. Shit, I left my phone in the car. I'll be right back. Shall I pause it? No, it's Chicca. This will take a while. - Hello. - Why the fuck were you there? Domenico, don't say that. What should I say? You wanted to meet my wife? Cause trouble? No, I just wanted to see you. I'm sorry. Speak up! Are you ashamed? You had the nerve to come to the pool. Stop, please. I can't talk now. Good. There's nothing more to say. Mom, Ciro wants to get out! I'm coming. Okay. He figured it all out, went down one floor and killed the friendly guy. Then he climbed down the elevator shaft and took out the other henchman. - Want to carry on? - Sure. What's up? I'm beat. Valerio threw a dinner at my place without asking me... for a Spanish friend. My head's killing me. Anna, what's wrong? Excuse me, could we change places? You're scaring me. What is it? I don't understand. I don't know what to do. I feel like an idiot. Calm down. I feel in love. Fuck! My God! - Do I know him? - No. Well, yes. Maybe you don't remember him. At Eliana's party, the waiter. Seriously? The one with the shrimp? I keep telling lies. I do crazy things. I realized there was something going on. All those messages. And Alessio? Alessio doesn't know. That's settled then. We leave Saturday morning, back Sunday evening at 9:00. Okay? Is that okay? This time, let's go to that retreat. - Where? - That retreat. It's a three-hour hike. That way we'll deserve the polenta and stew. I'm going for a smoke. Coming? Bruno? You know, I never realized but your wife is pretty hot. Ale, mind your own business, okay! Congratulations! Listen. Will you promise me something? What? If you see Bianca with another guy, you'll tell me. Has something happened? No, just asking. You'll tell me? Sure. Wouldn't you want to know? I don't know. I understand. I never considered it. I'll get it down for you. - Happy to be going to the Alps? - I guess. You guess? Why are you going then? Oh, you know. We haven't been there this year, and Alessio's happy. He's always happy. Isa! Ah, your sister... where is the thing? Excuse me, Auntie. Hello. Free tomorrow afternoon? No, I'm going away tomorrow. Can't you stay? You know what a shit you are? You treat me like dirt... I want you, Anna. I miss you. Come on, try. Tomorrow's Saturday. Are you free? If you can be. I want to be with you... All four hours. You'll look fantastic in Venice with this. Have a good trip. Bye, Francesca. - Say hi to your boss for me. - Sure. What a surprise. I told you we hadn't lost it. You were right. I'll close up and we can go for a pizza. I won't be a second. Ale, I have to tell you something. I can't come to the Alps. What do you mean? Morini needs me to go to Modena with him. And? A client put in a big claim. His warehouse burned down. We have to go tomorrow. - It's Saturday. - I know. Monday to Friday, fine. But not Saturday! You already do overtime on Wednesdays! He felt bad about it, but it's a big client. Who gives a damn! What are you, his slave? Just once... shit! For once we decide to go somewhere! Do what you want. I'm going. We look good together. What time is it? 10 to 8:00. I'm starving. Here. I want to have dinner with you. That would be nice. I'm not letting you go tonight. Don't joke. It'll only make things harder. I'm not joking. Come back. It's like a waltz. One, two, three. Like this? Where did you learn? I used to work in summer resorts. You danced with the ladies? Yes, but none moved as well as you. - Coming onto me? - More or less. A cocktail to start with? Caipirinha. Two caipirinhas. What did he say? - I don't like corn. - Me neither. So what do you really like? Canned tuna. Chocolate mousse. Broccoli in tomato sauce. Olives. And you? Pizza after a swim in the sea. Your hands touching me. Being underwater. Your face when you're coming. Anything else? I wish I'd met you sooner. Me too. Is it too late now? No, it isn't. Anna, I have to go. I was due home two hours ago. Who is she? What do you mean? I'm home late. Sorry. Don't bullshit me. I kept calling. Your phone was off! The battery died. Why are you such a bastard? Why do you treat me like this? Like what? Like an idiot. I didn't call your boss to avoid further shame, so I wouldn't look like shit. You could have called her. To say you're fucking someone else? The kids... You screw around, then think of the kids? I want to know who she is! There isn't anyone, damn it! What is it? Stop. What are you doing? You make me sick. I can smell her on you! Cut it out. - Tell me the truth! - I already did! I gave you everything, you ungrateful bastard. Get out. Get the fuck out. What are you doing here? I came back. I didn't feel like going. - Why? - No reason. I took a bus back. You look nice. Yes, the idea of working on Saturday got me down so... When did you get back? At 6:00. I bumped into Teo. He asked me to mend this. Why didn't you call me? You were working. - You were working, no? - Yes, but... then I went out with Chicca. If you'd called me... So? I knew you'd be back sooner or later. Listen. You don't need to explain. We've all been through it. I've always treated you like a son, right? Yes, I know. So listen to me. Things work out. Miriam is quite a character. If you try to explain, it won't work. You're not stupid. You know that up there... up there... there's everything you've achieved, right? Right. These are pastries for breakfast. Go on. Before the kids wake up. How are you? Kisses. Good morning. What's that? A surprise. Lend me a hand? That baby's a saint. Just what this family needed. After your brother, that's true. How should I take that? Great! He's just like me. I was an angel. - Once. - The wings still show. I'll get the meat. - I'll go, Mom. - Thanks. You really look great. Had beauty treatment? Yeah, a massage and steam bath every day. Are you working a lot? - Even Saturdays. - All to your credit then. I guess us husbands still have some use. Great cutlets! Your mom always yelled when you were little. "You'll ruin them with fried food," she'd say. You look like I ruined you! No, you saved me, Auntie. - Oh, Lord! - Thank God you're around. Stop it. You want to make me cry? So, basically, Antonio might have a little boy cousin to play with soon. Or a girl. What have you said? What have you said? Nothing. Just that we were thinking about it. It's great news. It's not news. - Enjoy your lunch. - Anna! Bye, Auntie. What's up? What happened? - I'll go see. - Yes, go. Excuse me. Anna! Stop! What's wrong? Why share our damn business? I didn't share anything! And what's the harm in it? We decided, didn't we? Did we? What did we decide? How often have we made love recently? What are you saying? What planet do you live on? Where are you? Who are you with? I never got off the pill. Where are you going? - How many for Dad? - Two. How can you miss a goal like that? - Slower than a spit-roast! - The attack's too weak. Get rid of him! Lousy, all of 'em. Who is it? Agnese, who is it? Give it to Daddy. It's not a toy! - Hello. - I was playing! Who is it? Hello. I can't hear. - Did I miss anything? - No. Mimmo, can you take care of Ciro? Sure. Let me have it. You have other toys. - I'd nearly finished. - Give me a break. Here I am. - Was Agnese any trouble? - The usual. You and I are stronger, right? Did you have a good time in the Alps? Yes, great. I'll be going. I still have to unpack. - The cheese doesn't go in the fridge? - No, not at all. Thank Bruno for me. Good night. Bianca? What's wrong? Nothing. I thought we were friends. Aren't we? Friends talk. Ale, forgive me. I'm sorry. So am I. So am I. Let's get some sleep. We're tired enough already. No, let me do it! Here already? Seven, eight, nine. One, two... three... and four. As extra. Thank you, ma'am. Guys, put your gloves on to do the napkins. - I washed my hands. - Use the gloves anyway. Ahmed, the boss wants you. I'll be right there. Everything okay? You got the gift? Just perfect. - You saw me, Daddy? - You were great. How about an ice cream? She found a job running the cloakroom at the Mirafloris disco. Ricky, we'll need to carry the stoves over this gravel. I can't stand her. She fought with her boyfriend again. I guess. Let's go to that shop... What do you want? - I need to talk to you. - Fuck off! Let me explain. - No need, it's perfectly clear. - What is? You're a shit. Just listen to me, okay. - What do you want? - I can't live without you. - You've been through hell? - Yes. - You don't believe me? - I do. Chicca, you believe him too? What do you want me to do? Get down on my knees? Just leave me alone! Cut it out! You're crazy! - Think I'm here waiting for you? - Let me speak! Listen, we had some really great sex and that was all. - You piece of shit. - Look who's talking. I love you! During the climb, Fausto Coppi pulls away from the pack and gains on the young leader. From that point on, I had a clear lead over... Going to bed or coming back? I still can't believe it. And now? What do you want? Help! They're too big. He says they match your eyes. Beautiful. - How much? - Good price. But how much? Good price. 70 Dinars. No, let me handle it. - 35. - No. It's good. Better than there? Different, let's say. I have to thank you. For what? For being here. I was worried you wouldn't see me. One dinar. - Wait. - No, let me. No, thank you, no. - How much? - 10 Dinars. No, five. Five Dinars. - 10. - Five. Seven. Eight. How much is eight? Five Euros. Here, take 10. Because I like you. For your daughter? Yes. I thought of her. She has a thing about fish right now. - How old is she? - Five. Almost six. Can I ask you something? Try me. What did you tell your wife? I left a note to say I'd be away for the weekend. And you? I told him. I couldn't stand the lies anymore. You told him about us? I said I was coming with you. What did he say? He'll give me time to work it out. A saint. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. One Dinar. The northern city woman. Go ahead, make fun. What will happen? When? Tomorrow, when we go back. Can't you live for the moment? - I'm trying to but... - I want to be with you. Two hours a week? Domenico, I'm just scared. So am I. I want you, but I don't want to deprive my kids. I feel guilty now. What for? This trip, all the money you spent. What's that got to do with it? My boss got married for the third time today. - He has money. - Right. It always comes down to that. It has to. We need to talk about it now? Okay, enough. Come here, Anna. Where are you going? Come back. Tomorrow, we go back. Me back to my place, you back to your wife. And then? We can't work it all out now. You're ready to dump your guy and leave? Your mind's made up? I thought we'd decide together. You have to understand, things aren't that easy for me. Yes, I understand. I love you, Anna. I need to use the restroom. - Know which bag is mine? - Of course.
