Roll up the window! What's wrong with you? I wouldn't have let my sister take your car. I haven't, bro. You're in love with her and she doesn't give a damn. That's not true. You don't let anyone use your car, except Rubi. You should tell her you love her. It's in the best interest of all of us. Yeah, sure. - Your license is expired, dude. - Is that my wallet? I had it in my butt. I get kleptomaniac when we talk about your sister. But be fair. You can't rob me. - Come on, man! I get nervous. - I'm your friend. I can't control it. Your boss lady is here. - Hey, Rubi. - Slacking off again? Good day, Rubi. Hello, Rubi. How are you? Would you let us resume our game? Thank you, Rubi. It's not playtime, Benji. Attention. We're about to become rich. I know. But we've got an hour waiting for you. And you show up all upset and freaked out. Attention, now! Attention. Sit down now. Sorry. People are terrible drivers and get on my nerves. - And my car? - The fender is bruised. - Oh, come... - What? Nothing. Focus on things that really matter. Let's remind ourselves why we're doing this. Keep the goal in mind. We'll finally get everything we've dreamed of. Not that! Be ambitious. It's time to take a step forward. A major stroke. Nothing can stop us now! You scared me. I was daydreaming. Stop daydreaming, make it happen, Benji. Maikol shall enjoy his cars, you, your videogames, and I'll focus on... I love you, Johnny. Building my hostel at the beach. A hostel at the beach? You hate the beach. I love the beach. I love it, too. You should stop spending all your money on auto parts. - I don't spend all my money on them. - Yes, you do. You use my car! - What did you say? - What? Glad your ex-boyfriend Johnny is in jail, or he would steal our money before the robbery. - Exactly. - Right? It's okay. After this, we'll never see each other again. Wait. Don't be so dramatic. We can see you at the beach. I like the beach. I need to know that you're ready for this, it's way more ambitious. I'm super ready. I was born ready. Maikol and I are ready. Both of you have been nagging for a bigger opportunity. This is your time to shine, and meet this challenge. Maikol's challenge is called Rubi. Am I right? Remember it's important to get a clean and traceless escape. Count me in, Rubelia. - What? - Rubi. Our access to a gold mine. Ernesto Guiterrez? I hate Ernesto Gutierrez! You'll be Ernesto Gutierrez for the last time. Saul Hernandez. I always thought he was a Gemini. Aries. Right? I love him. And Britney Aguilera. She's so hot... It's a great name. I think it makes sense... I took your wallet again. Really? Our biggest hurdle now has a face. Eulogio Granados. He looks cool, right? A nice guy. A kind guy, I'll say. Unfortunately for him, his plans are about to change. Once we get here, it'll be critical to find our X-factor. - The popular X-factor. - Yes. These are the surveillance cameras we'll block with decorations. They'll become blind spots. With Eulogio out of the picture, we'll take over. No more pickpocketing in subway cars. We are done stealing jewellery from people on the subway. No more wallet stealing We'll play the big leagues this year. Yes. Welcome to the "Big Job"! "Operation Merry Christmas" sounds better, doesn't it? It sounds better. Welcome to the "Big Job"! OPERATION MERRY CHRISTMAS - Benji. - I'm sorry. Eulogio, two minutes to enter! Two minutes! NORTH POLE Your first day on the job, and you're late. Santa won't get you any presents this year. Sorry. We're Ernesto and Saul. I know. Genaro filled me in. Where's Britney? - Well, she's... - Who? Speaking of the missing elf. Well, you have one minute to get ready, my dear elves. See you backstage. Sandwiches! - We have our X-factor. - Who? Second in line, male, a Rolex on left wrist. The time has come. IRON PALACE Santa Claus! Santa Claus! Good afternoon, everyone. I know, I know everyone here has been waiting for this moment for 365 days. But I need everyone to keep order and calm, please. On this day, all the children here are going to... Hello, kids from Mexico City. We're so pleased to make this stop on the Candy Tour for you. The reindeer are too tired out there. But they already had corn with epazote, a food that's rare at the North Pole. Are you ready to tell Santa all your Christmas wishes? Yes! I can't hear you! Are you ready? Yes! Let's welcome Santa Claus with a round of applause! Merry Christmas! Welcome to the best time of the year, where all your wishes can come true. Christmas is here! Diego and Daniela. Diego and Daniela, smile. Say, "Merry Christmas." One, two, three, Christmas. Come here to download your photo. Merry Christmas. One, two, Christmas. Please come here to get your picture. - I was robbed. - What? I was robbed. Help, someone. Security! My watch was stolen. Sir, lower your voice. Please stay calm. I can't keep my voice down. I've just been robbed here... it's not possible... It was one of them. - What? - I'm sure. I'll do something. Shall I call the police or what? I need you all to put your hands on the back of your heads. All of you. I suggest we take it easy. Sir, it's insulting to accuse us flippantly. I had my watch ten minutes ago. Do something. Search them. Do something! - Search us, Genaro. - Do something. - You can search me, sir. - I will. Well, go ahead. Search her, please. It's okay, son. Nothing. - There. I heard something. - I've nothing on me. Nothing. It's just my lunch. Your lunch? I call this stealing. I didn't know what to pick and took a bit of everything. It's just lunch. Hands up, please. Hands up! - Mr. Eulogio, I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. I can't believe it. A reindeer in the North Pole. I repeat, a reindeer in the North Pole. I've no idea where the hell you came from. I've been working in this business for ten years, it's my life. You won't do this to me, Mr. Eulogio. Especially not at Christmas. This is a mistake. Sure, Mr. Eulogio, this man dropped his watch right on your belly. I don't know how it got here. Really, I swear. How dare you do this to the kids on Christmas. I trusted you. - Take him. - I wouldn't do something like this. Please, I can walk on my own. Children, please. Be patient. We'll be back in five minutes. Smile. Christmas is coming soon. - Be patient. - We'll be back with the real Santa, - who doesn't steal things. - Nothing! Nothing. Happy night Happy night Ã“ lord, God of love We need to sort this out now. There're lots of children after lunch. No! Well, take it easy. We need to keep calm. - Well work it out, right? - Sure, we will. - Yes. - Sure. Relax. We need a new Santa. My time has come. No, no, no. What are you doing? I'm the best for this life mission. But... You are the store manager, Genaro. It's okay. We'll get a new Santa. You play a very important role out there. - Maybe the most important. - The most important. Everyone's expecting an explanation from you. - Are you sure? - Yes. Do you want to save Christmas? I do. You're a hero. A crack. Save Christmas, Genaro! Hello, kids from Mexico City! Welcome to our Candy Tour! Was not it... We want Santa Claus! The reindeer are too tired. But it's okay. They already had corn and corn. Santa and his elves are here for you! Welcome everyone. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! The suit doesn't fit him! Let's do this! - It's really simple. With a QR code. - We're ready for the picture. - See? It's really easy. - One, two, three. Christmas! Well done! Cool. A candy for you. That's great. You'll get it by... Step aside, you snoopy kid. That's great. It's going to be a beautiful picture. Merry Christmas! Have a candy. Lady, scan the... That's right! Perfect. That was great. You're so up to date. Use the QR code. See you! Well, let's call it a night. We did a great job, team. So... Christmas! He told me to memorize it. Wait! We're missing our picture. We're closed, buddy. No. We aren't closed. - Come, grandpa. - The Christmas spirit lives on. You can have your picture taken. - Thank you. - You're the last one. Santa's waiting. - What's your name? - Angel. Come meet Santa, Angel. I heard you were a good boy. Hi, how are you? Ready? One, two, three. - Christmas! - There you go! - Well done. - Thanks. Go here to download your picture. Cool. Have a candy. - But first download your picture. - Your cell, grandad. Great. That's right. Your camera. Well done. - Thank you. - No, thanks. Thank you. Happy Holidays. - To a great night, right? - To a terrific night. This is phase two. Did you get all the info? Benji? I extracted addresses, account statements and calendars from the cell phones. I selected seven houses that are in line with our plan. These two are eliminated. The family will be celebrating Christmas there. - Where are they? - Las Lomas. I mapped out a route to get in and out in the same night. Security guards? These five houses confirm through WhatsApp messages they're giving vacations to their employees. We'll only need to disable the security systems. It's okay. I'm already taking care of it. Okay. Well... To Operation Merry Christmas. I love that. It's the "Big Job", damn! RECORDING CALL Johnny. Honey! Are you ready for tomorrow? Yes, it's all set. Don't let me down. Without the money, the deal falls through. Everything is in motion. I've been so worried. You just trust me. They know what they're doing. You need to get rid of those pricks. Here's your dog, babe. Stop it. I must go. I'll bite you next time I see you. Your time's up, man. Give me back the cell phone. - Come on! You said one minute. - Give me back the cell phone. Who was it? The neighbor. - Her dog is lost. - Damn dogs. We have no neighbor. Eulogio Granados, or how people call him, "the watch-stealer Santa", was released on bail this morning after being imprisoned last night, accused of stealing from people who took their children to have their picture taken at the mall. The investigation continues while the parents are disappointed as a simple a picture with Santa, ended up being a nightmare. Thank you for your report. Yes, it really is upsetting for those who take their children... - Are you ready for the call, Benji? - Ready to record it. Ok. Here we go. Hello. Is this Mr. Javier GudiÃ±o? Mr. GudiÃ±o, this is Victoria Rufalo from Rubrik Security. Sorry to bother you on holiday season. Apparently, your house alarm was triggered and the police are already there. That's right, Mr. GudiÃ±o. We apologize. It was a technical failure. However, for security purposes, you need to change your alarm password. No problem, Mr. GudiÃ±o. I can put you through to the Security area where you will be requested your old password. I'll put you through then. We're pleased to assist you at Rubrick's Security Area. Please, enter your password. Thank you. Your information has been verified and everything's correct. Before hanging up, please enter your new password. You can do it now. Your new password was received. We provide you with 24 hours a day service. My name is Victoria Rufalo from Rubrick Security. Keeping burglars away from your home. Jesus, Rubi! You deserve an Oscar. And I'd give you a few punches. Would you hurry up? We have 30 seconds. Are you done? Maikol! One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... Hello, Mr. GudiÃ±o. Hello. Oh, my God! We have a 35-45. Car theft. It seems the suspect... "The suspect." Cryptocurrencies. They have everything. Cool. How's it going, Benji? Almost done. Don't just sit there. There's a lot to put in the bag. This is worth more than whatever you got. This is what I call tax evasion. Guys. - Are you allowed to be here? - Damn Maikol. If I wanted to steal mirrors, I'd bring someone else and send you to Polanco. They are for my car. You left it in bad shape. - It was in bad shape when I used it. - Of course not. - Okay, yes. - Let's get out of here! - Count all the bills, Benji. - What do you mean? They had crypto. Think big, Rubi. Oh, my God. This is a work of art. Maikol? - What's that? - The tree. - Benji. - I mean, the timer. Do you want some? This is the fucking life we deserve. No, wait! Are you sure your employers are out of town? They are. They'll be back after New Year's Eve. Let me get some snacks. Such a huge house. And a big pine tree, Lore. - It's a big pine tree. - A big pine tree. Come here. Here. I like it on the stick. I like it. What are you doing, Benji? Are you kidding me? - Shall we go to the pool? - Is it hot? Just like you. Let's go to the pool. - It feels nice. - Look. A bottle of wine. Come here. Just like in the movies. What do you mean? With the crypto I collected, I'll be a millionaire in three years. Then I'll afford a castle with a lake. Also a catamaran and a jacuzzi too... - Just focus. - Yes, I'll focus. The alarm was off. They are asking for it. They won't even notice that we entered this place. What does an old man do with that kind of money? - I can tell you, Benji, that... - Shut up. It's almost dawn and we still have three houses to go. Oh, my God! Cookies. To Santa. I thought no one did this anymore. No way! - Is it the timer again? - No. Merry Christmas! Holy Mother of God. Did you think you had made it? - Right? - Eulogio? What are you doing here? This is my house, Britney. Jennifer, Winona, or whatever you call yourself, Rubi. I heard that you weren't good kids this year. And the cookies and milk, Benji? They're good, right? It's just that you'll need a bathroom in about 17 minutes. Let's get out of here. Or not. Tell him to put the gun down, Eulogio. You won't tell me what to do, Rubi. - Actually, it's the opposite. - What do you want? Make you pay for what you did. We did nothing to you. Well, you can tell that to the police. They'll be here in 21 minutes. Right after Benji finishes shitting his pants. Please. Follow me to my office. Come on. This is all they brought with them? Listen. We can make a deal. You can have half of everything. Keep the jewelry, the painting. I don't care about stolen goods. We can have so much more. We can do this together, Eulogio. Stop it, Rubi. You'll make me cry. Is this your big job, kids? - What do you want? We'll do it. - All right, Rubi. It seems that you're the wisest thief in the group. Do you think only you had a plan for this Christmas? I had a perfect plan. But you ruined it. Now, you'll be working for me. Welcome to Operation Merry Christmas. Yes. That sounds better. I'm missing three items from my list. And you're going to get them for me. Your list? Like a Santa's list? Or what list are you talking about? And what are those items on your list, Santa? An ostrich egg. The cape of a famous wrestler, Queen Ivory. And an old doll abandoned at San Martin School. I need them by tomorrow night. So, you only have 24 hours to get them. What if we refuse? Santa won't bring us presents? Santa never brings us presents, Rubi. You're the last one. Santa's waiting. - What's your name? - Angel. - Come meet Santa, Angel. - What? A cane can be more useful than you think. I heard you were a good boy. What? Did you took his watch too? You know I'm a klepto sometimes. We said we'd stick to the fucking plan, damn Maikol. - I got nervous, damn Rubi. - I knew I couldn't trust you. I know you better than you think. I know you don't have bank accounts. And now you don't have any money either. And your faces will be displayed at toll booths, airports, bus stations or any means of escape that you can think of. So don't try it. I've learned my lesson, Santa. Thank you. But if Rubi got us into this, she needs to get us out by herself. What? - We are in this together. - I didn't even want to. What kind of brother are you? We1d agreed on that. How do you dare say that! You can't take it back. He was whom abandoned you. How could you think that? What about your... Enough! Stop it! You guys are amazing. Your positive energy is palpable. I hope you've kept your elves' costumes. - Because you'll need them. - Why? This wouldn't be any fun without a Christmas feel to it. - Gross! - I need a bathroom again. - Again? - Yes. We've made three stops already. - I know. - It's so gross! Careful with the bumper. I promise you this was it. It was called Rancho Alegre. - We came every year. - Are there ostrich eggs here? What are we doing in a paintball field? There were plenty of ostriches here. They even offered sandwiches here. Kind of sticky, and smelled like poop, but you could still eat them. You're right. I remember those sandwiches. It's this way. Come with me. PAINTBALL FIELD Freeze! Who are you? Identify yourselves. Monserrat MaraÃ±on. On your knees. Three, two, one... The shepherds to Bethlehem They run, very hasty They've run so much Their shoes are worn out So merry they go Will they come back? With the tam, tam, tam, With the bou, bou, bou, With the tam, with the bou With the tambourine And the castanets Cut your strategy, soldiers. It's not a strategy, it's a Christmas carol. We don't beg here, we work. We're here on an emergency. What kind of emergency? Wasn't this an exotic breeding farm? Well, it depends. Depends on what? They even offered sandwiches. Depends on who's asking? What are you? Police officers, DEA agents? No. We only need an ostrich egg. - An ostrich egg? - Yes. We desperately need it. Really? And in case there's an ostrich egg here, you know that costs big money, right? - Are you willing to pay for it? - I told you we'd find it here. And in the event there is one, - how much would it cost? - Let me see. - Fifty. - Fifty what? Fifty thousand a kilo. We won't be leaving here without the egg. Soldier? A question. That right there is a Game Play 7? It is. With all games decoded? - Yes. - From all regions? Right. Did you download Gangsters vs. Zombies? - I did! - I want it. That's not going to happen. It's out of stock in seven countries and a six-month wait to get it shipped. I want it. Device, cord and batteries. And the decoded game. - No way. - In return for the egg. Give it to me, fatso. I want it, fatso. She wants it, fatso. She wants it, fatso. Let it go. Let it go now! Soldiers, it is my honor doing business with you. It's at the back of the orchard. - You'll find it there. - Ok. Thank you. Soldier! A sandwich? You owe me a Game Play 7. Stop whining. It's collateral damage, battle scars. I'm not whining. But it's like taking his car from Maikol. You can't compare. A car is more expensive. - Of course not. - Shut up now! - Dart. - For animals. The egg! - It's bigger than I thought. - And it was very easy to find. - Let's get out of here. - Come on. Hands up! - Don't shoot! - Don't shoot! You're surrounded. - We can make a deal. - We can make a deal. - What do they want? - What do you want? You don't know who you've messed with. We'll show no mercy. - What do we do? Benji? - I don't know. - I'll cover you. - Are you sure, Benji? - Are you sure? - Run! Save yourselves! I love you! "Say hello to my little friend." Your attention, please. Time's up. Get out of the war field as soon as possible. Well, let's move on. I've a contact in Queen Ivory's staff. - I want to wash all this dirt off. - I'll keep my battle wounds. I didn't even get myself filthy. EGG - DONE THE CAPE AND DOLL - MISSING Maybe Santa wants the ostrich egg to feed his reindeer. Because I don't think they like corn with epazote. This guy's a sorcerer. He's neither a sorcerer nor Santa, he's a tradesman. Whatever. But we have his egg with us. I think I'll go in alone, take the cape and be on our way. - We can go with you. - I insist. The wrestling world is highly secretive. And I wouldn't like them to freak out when they see the three of us. It's okay. I'll get something to eat. - Okay. - No. Here are some chips. That's good. When did you change your wig? My what? Your... You're so weird, Benji. Come on. Hi, Queen. - The Pole is here! - Yes. - What are you doing here? - I was passing by. I need a favor, Queen. You vanish out of thin air and now you need a favor? - Well... - You didn't even say goodbye. You would've been a fantastic wrestler. One, two, three... Bell over Bell And over bell another Lean out the window Youll see the Child in his craddle Enough. Stop it! Who are they? Candela Cienfuegos. Benji Cienfuegos. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I need... one of your capes, Queen. - You're asking too much, aren't you? - I'm not. It's just one cape. - What do you want it for? - It's for a good cause. A good cause. Charro, provide him with equipment. If you want one of my capes, you'll train with me today. So you can show your friends what you can do. Let's go. Did you notice how she stared at me? I won't tolerate that. Who are you, dude? You can do this, Maikol! Crush him! That's it! Good job! He deserves that! Well done. I hope to see you soon. Well...? Charro, given them my cape. And get my things. Thanks. I'm exhausted. - What did you do? - You've killed her. - It wasn't me. - You killed her, Benji! You killed her! My God! - I'm so sorry... - Shut up. No, no. This can't be happening, you idiots. - I did nothing. - Check if she's breathing. - I didn't mean to kill anyone. - She's breathing. She's fine. - We must leave now. - Help me carry her. - Are we taking her with us? - We can't leave her here. This is so weird. - Just carry her. - Careful. My Queen. Here we go. One, two, three... I got her. Are we going to carry a wrestler just like that? That's weird. EGG AND THE CAPE - DONE DOLL - MISSING I'll write my letter to Santa next year. - Enough with Santa already. - He's a sorcerer. He's neither a sorcerer nor Santa, he's a hustler. I should be in my hostel at the beach, instead of listening to your nonsense. It's Christmas time, relax. This place is scary. It reminds me of the nuns from our childhood. - Are we here now? - Yes. How's my Queen doing? She's still sleeping. Your Queen? Did you two have a thing? Are you jealous? Let's get the last item of this nightmare. Here. Your watch landed in my hand. I knew that old man was a sorcerer. I'm sure he performs rituals. - This isn't working. - Benji? Benjamin, wait! This is a spooky place. Look! Candies. I'll pick the blue ones. Those candies are for kids who get A's on their exams. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm Rosaura, this school's senior master. May I help you? Benjamin, never enjoy a reward before deserving it. She knows my name. We need one of the abandoned dolls. - Who sent you? - It doesn't matter. What are all these dolls doing here? I take care of them. And they take care of me. They've been abandoned by kids for years in the playroom. Now they are all mine. And you need one of them, don't you? But to do that, you need to bring me an offering. An offering. An offering, in return. I've nothing to offer you. Are you sure? I'm not feeling well. One, two, three... FALTA MÃšSICA What's going on with you? You should throw up soon. The reward will be a punishment for you. A punishment for you. A... - What's wrong with me? - We'll get some water for you. This doll is for you. - It's for somebody else. - I'm not asking you. This doll is for you. I think you're mistaken. I don't believe in these things. What are you talking about? These things. Do you know why people want these dolls? I don't. They bring love to your life. The love you've been needing. Parental love. Baby girl. Sibling love. Romantic love. No. I'm a lucky girl. Yes. You are. But you don't know it. I need your offering. I've nothing to offer you. - Your wig. - It isn't a wig. Your wig. You need to stop seeking what you really want in the wrong place. Or maybe it's under your nose and you haven't noticed it. This is the real Lucy. No one had called me Lucy since I left this school. You must leave. You have things to do before dawn. Thank you. EGG, THE CAPE AND DOLL - DONE Are you okay? Are you okay? I feel bad. - Just run, Benji! - Come on! Run! Get him! Open the door! - Queen has disappeared. - He took all our stuff. - Come on! Let's go! - Stop right there, jerk! The police! Freeze! Stop right there! - The police! - Watch it, Benji! The police! Let me go! Let me go, damn it! Maikol, no! Don't! - Let her go! - I love you, Maikol! I love that you've helped me out. - Let me go! - You're under arrest! Recover all our stuff, Rubi! - Let me go! - Help me! I want my mommy! I need my mommy! Please! Stop right there! Freeze! You need to come with me. Welcome to hell, fuck... Eggnog is ready, Rosenda! - The party is about to start. - Let's go. I think this is it, right? I wanted something good for us. A better life. Maybe it didn't go as planned, but... at least we experienced it together. It was Johnny's plan, isn't it? What? Rubi planned all this to help Johnny out of jail. You did? - Why didn't you say anything? - I don't know. You don't know. Had it not been for me, you would've never stopped playing your video games, Benji. You should stop hiding under your wigs. And you, Maikol, stop chasing her. Do you know why he can't say no to you? Because he loves you. He's right. Did you know that your boyfriend cheated him? I'm so stupid. I just wanted us to be a family. I don't waste my money in auto parts or... Do you understand that if Johnny asked you to get rid of us, he'll do the same to you, Lucia? Thank you for not leaving me alone. You've never been alone. Among so many pilgrims Many pilgrims... Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Get up. You can leave now. What? Are we free to go? Hurry up, before I change my mind. Why...? Don't ask. Let's just get out of here. Someone bailed you out. And Queen Ivory was found. - So, get out of here. - You mean Queen is fine? Yes. She was found disoriented in an alley. - But she is fine? - Yes. Come on. Window 14. Martha, take care of them. Miguel Quintana IÃ±iguez? It's me. Benjamin Mendez Hidalgo? It's me. Lucia Mendez Hidalgo. Yes. Here are your things. - Your bail bond. - Thank you. "Now you know what it's like to work hard for something." Be satisfied and proud only to have someone take it all away from you without remorse. Make your lives useful and leave others alone. The items I asked weren't for me, but for three foster kids who're waiting to be adopted. And now, those children will get nothing thanks to you. "Merry Christmas. Santa." Let's go. Next. What are you doing? Nothing. I'm organizing my tools. My tools are here just as an excuse to be around you. I like you, and you make me nervous. That kiss really freaked me out. Johnny and I broke up. Can we talk? No. I'm sorry. Okay. I understand. What are you doing? I'll go to see the foster kids. But there are no presents for them. I need to explain to them. We can't overlook the situation. What are you talking about? We've nothing for them. But they're expecting something that'll make their day, give them some excitement. Have you forgotten, Benji? How it feels when you expect to be loved and never happens? I'll drive you. We'll bring them tamales, and I never want to see you two again. I promised never to wear that costume again. You don't hate us. - Can I exclude the ears? - No. Just in time. - Hello. - Hi. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Did Santa send you? I guess so. Come in. Elves! - Our presents? - Where is Santa? Santa was glad to come here, and had it all planned out perfectly, he knew what you wanted. But we were very bad elves and ruined everything. But Santa doesn't want you to think he has forgotten you. That's so sad. But he sent us to tell you a story. The story of three unruly elves who refused to work at the North Pole. They started doing prank after prank, and engaged in lots of adventures. That was Santa's secret plan. One of his reindeer helped him. Santa spied on them through a secret camera. He was always two steps ahead of them. The elves' first mission was to get out of their comfort zone and play outdoors. Then, the elf realizes that he must live his life. He takes the guns and tells his friends, "Save yourselves.", and was shot paintballs at him. But that was just the beginning. Santa had a day full of lessons for them. Then, they went to see a wrestler. The elf remembered what it was like doing what he loved the most. And believed in himself. But Santa saved the lesson requiring the most courage till the end. And they went to a really scary place. And they met the Doll Lady. She tought the lady elf to love and accept herself just the way she was. When the elves thought their mission was over, they lost everything. They had to get back all they had worked so hard for. The elves ran, jumped... and ended up in the elves' prison. There they learned that they only had each other. That was the most important thing. They were family. They weren't proud of themselves, but Santa knew they were sorry about it. Then, the elves got out of jail once they had learned their lesson planned by Santa, Operation Merry Christmas. Guys! This was left at the door. - That's... - Isn't it yours?
