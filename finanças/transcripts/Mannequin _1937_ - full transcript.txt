[orchestral music] [whistle blows] [workers chattering] [bell dinging] - See you on Monday, Jessie. - Goodnight, Flo. Get out of the doorway, you kids! Keep out of the street! Oh, good evening, Jessie. [baby crying] [crying continues] [baby crying] - 'Hello, Jessica.' - Hello, Pa. - Anything happen? - Well, no, Jessie. You see, I've been waiting for a fellow. He was coming around today... But he didn't show up, I know. [door closes] You know, it takes time to do things, Jessie. I know, Pa. - Hello, Jessica. - Hello, Ma. I'm not late, am I? The quails haven't been cooking too long, have they? It's terrible hot here today. Must have been worse for you at that factory. I've a system. While I'm running up hems and sowing up buttons I just think of green fields with birds and flowers. That makes it a pleasure to be working in that dump. I know, Jess, but tonight Eddie can take you some place 'where it's cool and fresh.' Eddie and Saturday night. Oh, here. I forgot. It's saturday again. Mmm. Thanks. Reminds me, I must pay that gas bill. - Potatoes done? - They're hot. Gas bill? Did I say gas bill? That gas bill should've been paid last week. I know. You gave the money to him. No, I didn't. That is not all of it. Then you gave part of it to Clifford. You mustn't be too hard on your brother. - He hasn't found a job. - Because he doesn't want to. And why should he? He gets enough quarters and dimes from my salary to throw around that pool room. - Now, Jessie... - I'm getting sick of it. I could've bought two pairs of stockings with that two dollars and I need them. [sighs] Leaky faucets, dirt, smells. What a place to live? What a place to grow up in? - Jessie, be reasonable. - Maybe I don't like it. I want to spend the rest of my days in beautiful Hester Street. I hate it. I'm gonna get out. I've got to get out, Ma, before it's too late. Maybe when I'm gone, they'll get hungry enough to get a job. It's been awful lately, Jessie. Maybe you're working too hard. Me work too hard? Don't make me laugh, Ma. You go and get ready to meet Eddie. - I'll peel the potatoes. - No, you won't. And I won't either. Your father doesn't like his potatoes with the jackets on. Doesn't he? If you want these peeled, peel 'em yourself. Remember Swing, she ain't a dame that bounces around corners. - Lay off. - So, she's a swell dame? So, I put on a strut. And can I do it, Barrel? The name is Beryl, not "Barrel". Beryl. Is Jessie coming down tonight, or when? When she does come nobody'll remember how long we waited. - Hi, Clifford. - Hey, slug. And they call him a fighter? Go on, you little mutt. Tell your sister we're waiting for her. - Yeah? What will it get me? - Nice kid, that Clifford. [humming] Dogs and the hay again, huh? What a surprise. There's nothing wrong with Frankfurters and Sauerkraut. Lots of people'll be glad to have a dinner like this. Yeah, tell me who and I'll give 'em mine. - Hey. - Okay, pa. Give me a couple, will ya? And easy on that grass. Oh, where's Jess? Hiya, dynamite. Stepping out with the big fight manager, huh? Am I laughing? [chuckles] Well, shut up your laughing. I'm sorry, Ma, if I said too much before. - Goodnight. - You needn't hurry. That guy won't be around for an hour yet. - Scale us a hunk of bread, ma. - 'Who won't be around?' That ham-and-egger you go out with. What a fake that guy is. I hope you grow up to be the same kinda fake. - You'll amount to something. - I'm ain't saying nothing. Except he's a lemon, that's all. - That'll be all, young man. - What'd I say? Everybody knows Eddie Miller's a false alarm. That ain't no secret. [door closes] Why don't you make Clifford behave himself? Clifford, you keep that trap of yours closed. Eddie Miller is a fine boy. Sauerkraut. [baby crying] Eddie. I thought I'd have to wait for you. You'll never have to wait for me, sugar. You look terrific. Swing and Beryl are outside. Slip me a quick one. How did I wait this long for that? It seems like years in between, doesn't it? Sounds like something good to talk about. [baby crying] Let's get out of here. [carnival music] What is it about tonight that makes it seem especially nice? Saturday. You don't have to work tomorrow. It's the moon. Why do you suppose the moon's always bigger on Saturday night? 'Cause it don't work on Sunday either. Look at it, hanging up there. Throwing back light of the sun on the whole world and us. Turn the dark into light. [laughing] Gee, listen to me. I'll be making poems, next. I must be in love or something. Poems don't keep you warm in the winter. That's when you need coal. And I'm getting it, baby. In a few months Swing'll be champ. Then on guys in knee pants will announce us - at to the front door. - I want to think about now. Look, Eddie. Here's a world. You and I have this little space all to ourselves. What we feel for each other shuts out all the rest. So, what more do we need? That's all people have to fight for.. A little place to themselves. Do you see what I mean? Sounds nice, the way you put it, kid. Put your arm around me, Eddie. Can you think of anybody in the world that's got more than we have right now? - Can you? - Fine for any man's money. It's enough for mine, Eddie. - I'll see you tonight, Eddie. - I don't think I can make it. Gotta take swing up the A. C. Gotta start working him. - I'll pick you up Monday. - But that's two days away. Two years away is more like it. I'll wait here till you go upstairs, kid. [baby crying] (female) 'Get out of here, you.' (male) 'Go on, you dirty little rat.' [door slamming] (Eddie) 'You okay, baby?' 'How about it, baby?' Eddie! - Eddie, I can't. - What's the matter? I can't go back up there. I'd rather die. Take me with you. - You know how it is. - I don't care. I don't care if we have nothing. We can work that out. I'll keep my job. I won't ask you for a thing. I won't be in your way. Honest. I'll work hard and I'll do whatever you say. Can't we be married now, Eddie? Can't we be married now? Sure, kid. Sure. Oh! I got you here tonight, boys, to ask your advice on a matter. The time has come for John L. Hennessey Corporation to expand and I wanted to ask you boys what you think. (men) We're all with you John. This expanding business means buying something, right, John? Yeah. Yeah. Something like that, Tim. Then I'm again' it! Well, maybe you won't be Tim when you hear the proposition. Tomorrow morning, boys, I can close a deal to acquire the McGuiness Dredging Company. Lock, stock and barrel. Twenty four of the finest barges ever constructed. [cheers and applause] I'm still again' it! [laughter] Boys, as long as you're all with me on the proposition.. That is, everybody except Tim.. [laughter] why, I guess there's nothing more to say. I wanted you to know what we're doing and why we're doing it. You've strung along with me this far. We've built a rowboat into the world's finest harbor fleet. And for the benefit of all of us we want to keep it growing. Those yearly bonuses come in handy, huh? [crowd shouting] - Any complaints? - No! No! No! No! Come on. Come on, now. How about you, Timmy? I'm still again' it! [laughter] Hey, Tim. You didn't by any chance go to Harvard, did you? [laughter] You see, Briggs, how can I go broke with that gang backing me? How would I know? I'm a Harvard man. - Where do we go from here? - Briggs, you're a lucky man. I'm about to buy you a mess of the world's finest Gefilte fish. - But I don't like Gefilte fish. - With horseradish, red cabbage? You're crazy. Of course you like it? I'd say we were thousands of miles away from Gefilte fish. Oh, no, clever people, these Chinese. There you are, Briggs, you see, regular Saturday night party. Only it isn't a Saturday night. Must be celebrating something. - Hello, Horowitz. - Well, Mr. Hennessey. What'll it be tonight? Some real "A" number one Chinese food? Now, quit stalling, Horowitz, and bring it on. - Plenty of that red cabbage. - Two Gefilte fish, mandarin. Is there something special going on there, at the long table? That one with the eleven 85-cent dinners? - They just got married. - Married? Well, well, well. Oh, they're still doing it in Hester Street, huh? - Got any champagne? - For you, Mr. Hennessey? Not for me, for them. Thank you, Mr. Hennessey. Well, we put away a lot of chopsuey. - Let's lift a cup to the kids. - That's right. Everybody get set. Here's to the bride. Bride. It's swell of all you people. I just don't know what to say. Sit down, dope. You ain't the bride. Somebody got married. I guess I heard what the man said. [laughter] And we heard what the man said. Didn't we, baby? I can't remember the words. Just the music. Thanks, everybody. I hope you'll all be as happy as I am right now... always. - When do we go home? - We can't go now, Eddie. What is this? We've been married two hours. - Will we ever get to be alone? - Shhh. Eddie. (Horowitz) 'Champagne. Hot stuff, eh?' [cork pops] Somebody launching a boat? - Hey, who ordered that? - Mr. Hennessey. - Mr. Hennessey? - Which Hennessey? Oh! John L. Hennessey. The guy who owns all the boats. Take a look at him, honey. A big shot. A real big shot. - You should thank him, Eddie. - Yeah. I was just going to. And talk fast. Maybe you can cut yourself in for a job. Can't you even shut up at a wedding? [chuckles] - Maybe you better come along. - Me, why? A chance to meet Hennessey. It'll do us some good. We can't pass up a bet like this. Tell him I want to get married too. I'll marry anybody but a flyweight. Uh-oh. He's bringing his wife over. Hmm, and not bad. Mr. Hennessey. I'm Eddie Miller. This is Mrs. Miller, since an hour ago. Hello. My name is Briggs, and I hate Gefilte fish since all my life. [light laughter] Eddie, you haven't thanked Mr. Hennessey yet. Oh, sure. Thanks for the champagne, Mr. Hennessey. - You're from Hester Street too. - That's right. Just got the breaks and went right up there, huh? - Eddie, I don't think... - That's alright. I'll be up there myself one of these days. - 'Plenty of room at the top?' - That's what they tell me. Maybe, they would like to come to our table. You don't want that tribe climbing all over him. But say, maybe, you'd like to dance with the bride? - Well I-I... - I don't think Mr. Hennessey... Sure, he would. He ain't blind. - Well, Mrs. Miller. - Uh... sure. You see? Come on, honey. Show him how it's done. I think your wife is very charming, Mr. Miller. You just think it. I know it. What does a fella say to a new bride that just got married? They usually wish them luck, but I don't need any. Right there already, huh? In the promised land. That's right. Today and tomorrow, from now on. It'll always be like that? Yes, that's right. That's the stuff. You got everything, huh? Well, everything we'll ever need. Each other. That's a pretty thought. - Violets, huh? - Yes. I love them. They're so beautiful and helpless-looking. You're beautiful. But I'm afraid the resemblance ends there. [chuckles] Shouldn't we go back to our table or something? Huh? What, no encores? Hey, Briggs, dump a flock of nickels in that gadget, please. ["Always and Always" by Joan Crawford] Oh. Do you mind, Mr. Hennessey? - What's wrong? Not so good? - No, it isn't that. I like to dance with you, only it's this particular song. - Why? - It's ours. - Eddie's and mine, I mean. - You mean, you wrote it? No, we fell in love to it.. And so we always dance to it together. That must sound awfully silly to you. No. No, it doesn't. I just didn't think things like that happened outside of books. [chuckles] Uh, Miller? It's your song Miller, that leaves it to you. Anything the matter? No, I just explained to Mr. Hennessey about our song. Oh. But we can skip this one. Go ahead. - But Eddie, I... - No, don't give anything away. - I wouldn't. - You're right, Mr. Hennessey. You don't find them around every place, huh? - Goodbye, Mr. Hennessey. - Goodbye, Mrs. Miller. And so they were married. It looks like it might be love. Might be? They've even got a song that goes with it. * Da da dee da da dum * Da dee da da dee * Da dum * Always and always * I'll go on adoring * * The glory * And wonder of you * Always and always * My love will go soaring * To heaven far under the blue * Life is strange and ever changing * * Doesn't make reason or rhyme * * But through all the centuries time endures * * Darling we'll be together * * For ever and ever * For always * And always * I'm yours * - Eddie. - Huh? - Guess what? - What? We're on our way home. We're better than that, kid. We're here. - How's the outside look to you? - Oh, Eddie. Eddie, we're near the river, aren't we? You can throw egg shells in it. That's what you wanted, right? Oh.. How about it, kid? Eddie.. Huh? Now, what's the matter? [chuckles] Eddie, why am I crying? There's nothing in the world that I haven't got right now. Oh, Eddie. It's too early morning to take a clout on the chin. - Clout on whose chin? - Yours. This would be the morning after, wouldn't it? After what? 'The wedding.' Oh, the Miller's. What brought that up? Well, I was just thinking... Well, what I meant to say was... Don't you think that... Oh, so that's how it is, huh? Well, what I- what I meant to say was that I thought she was a sweet kid. I mean, naive, you know, both of 'em. Yes, they were. Wasn't she? - Darling. Eddie. - Hmm? You'll find the toast and bacon in the oven. Coffee's on the stove. Don't forget to turn off the gas. - Goodbye. - Goodbye? You saying I'm eating breakfast alone on the first morning? - Darling, I haven't much time. - So, you'll be late. So what? [chuckles] - Where am I? - It's over there. Oh, pour yourself another cup of coffee. I'll be right with you. Alright, darling. You're a success, baby. It's a great racket. Why we didn't think of it before? I did. 'Aren't you gonna eat your toast and bacon" No percentage in it. How about that job of yours? No wife of mine is gonna work in a dump like that for money. How'd you like to work in a Gebhart show? 50 slugs a week? But you gotta be able to sing and dance and-and act. 'With your looks they'd hire you if you couldn't walk.' I'm yanking you out, as soon as the dough rolls in off swing. Don't get the idea I'm letting any wife of mine earn the cakes. Maybe, I've got talent I don't know about. Maybe, the rich young man who produces it, might notice first. Meanwhile, I've gotta run up some buttonholes for Mr. Jones. If he says anything, tell him I said "fish-cakes" to him. Yeah, sure. I'll be home as soon as I can. - And, honey. - 'Yeah?' I'm a little short, you know that blow out last night. - Have a couple of extra bucks? - Yeah, I think so, Eddie. Two? Well, I-I've only got five. I'll get it changed. Thanks, babe. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Did I kiss you goodbye? - I kissed you. Never mind the argument. Who're gonna think about all day? You. - And don't you ever forget it. - No, I won't. Bye. [broadway music] I'll never learn that finale. Don't worry. If you lose this Eddie'll get you another. He doesn't want me to work. You've been telling me that for months. Why don't you come along and have some fun? For a guy that never used to throw parties Hennessey throws the best kind and everybody's welcome. The battle you put up isn't worth the chicken salad. - Eddie wouldn't want me to go. - Yeah, I remember Mr. Miller. - Guess he's waiting for you. - Hasn't missed a performance. Great little waiter, Eddie, ain't he? As long as you like it, baby. - Hi, Beryl. - Hello, Superman. - She'll be right out. - Going to Hennessey's party? My report card says "never absent and never late." - Goodnight. - Why ain't Jessie going? On one for those wild affairs that Hennessey gives? You wouldn't want her carried some night full of sandwiches. Stop it. I didn't even know she was asked. Not that Mr. Hennessey would be the right man for her. Sure he would. That's the kind of people I want her to get to. Such a smart dame. Only you just talked Jessie out of some fun. I would've let her go. Now, she stays home. You'll change your mind and hers too, if she doesn't want to. 'Cause you're the thoughtful type, ain't you, sweet? [engine turns over] [piano music] Is there any reason, why you should be alone? - It's soon to tell, isn't it? - That's not a bad answer. - I'm Dave Mclntyre. - And you worked J. L. Yes, he's a great guy. Yes, I'm having a good time. Yes, I'd like a drink and yes we'll walk outside afterwards. Fine, that carries us over about two hours and brings us up to the point where I start talking about your eyes. - When'll Mr. Hennessey arrive? - Oh, he's always late. He likes to let things get warmed up before he checks in. - Now, about you and me... - Sorry, I never ride tug boats. Even if you are the captain. Sorry, that's how I got it. - How late am I? - Three rounds of cocktails. - Mrs. Miller's here. - She is? Good. Good. It's about time, I was getting pretty sick of these brawls. - You're Mr. Hennessey! - Hello. - My name is Adair. - My fans call me Bubbles. I like chicken legs best because they.. Because they have handles on 'em. Here I am, Mr. Hennessey. Right here. Hmm? Oh, oh yes. Briggs. I'll be back in a minute. Darling, this is, Mr. Briggs. He-he has no friends. - John, she's here. - Yeah, yeah, I know. He's a Harvard expert on Economics. He'll entertain you. - Mike. - I hate economical evenings. Get a few plates of food out on the terrace. And when you're done, get some violets. Nice, big bunch. One for you. One for you. And one for me. Thanks for coming to my party, Mrs. Miller. Well, you came to mine, Mr. Hennessey. - Are we going some place? - Yeah. Sit here and talk over. - But talk what over? - Well, it's your song. Maybe, you're still dancing it with Eddie. You mean are we still together? But of course. But I thought... you're in the Gebhart show. Yes, but.. Oh, I see, but that's only for a while. Eddie, I mean, Mr. Miller, has the contract on Swing Magoo. Swing Magoo? He's a fighter and when he gets bigger fights I suppose we'll have lots of money, but it isn't important. - It isn't? - Thank you. Thanks, Mike. Now, run out and get those, will you? - Let's go over there. - But it's nice here. - I wanna show you something. - What if I don't wanna go? Then we'll stay here. - What time is it? - About 12:30. Oh, don't run away. We'll be friends after a while. - You like it from here? - Mm-hmm. It's beautiful. Looks like the city was piled up against the dark. See way down there in that corner? The little red and green lights? Those are my boats. They're beautiful too. I-I must be going now, it's been very nice. Yes, hasn't it? We've been off on the wrong foot all evening, haven't we? I thought we'd get it straightened out. I didn't think you'd run away for a few unpleasant minutes. Goodnight. So, the money isn't important? - You can't believe that? - No. You've spent your whole life piling it up, what've you got? - Pile of money. What about you? - Three rooms. And you're married, and work in a chorus. You'll go on, trying to keep those rooms. Fighting to get by. - That's right. - Why? Because I've got them now. I'm working in a chorus. I'll work in a laundry. I'll work till I drop to keep him. I never knew anything could mean so much to anybody up to now. [piano music] Entertain the kids, Briggs. [intercom buzzing] Hello. Yes, sir. - Yes. Absolutely. Yes, sir. - Why are we going up? That's the only way we can reach the upper floors. - Let me out. - I can't while we're running. - Then stop it. - But it's against the law. I can't let you.. I'll let you out in just a minute. Perfect entrance, Mike. - You forgot these. - Why are you following me? I'm not following you, I'm with you. Let's start all over. You proved you're a nice girl. Let me prove I'm not a bad guy. Hey, cab! Let go of me. You can't force people to do what you want. You were my guest and I wanna do things according to the book. May I see you home? How's that? Not very good, but you'll think up another one. That's right. It's just something that's got to happen. [brakes squealing] I did the wrong thing, didn't I? - So did you. - By going to your silly party. You shouldn't have slugged me. You must learn to handle such situations more elegantly. Always leave the man holding the bag. I like my way best. You really don't blame me for kissing you, do you? What do you think that slap was? A distinguished service cross? What I mean is, you were beginning to add up into something that a man wants. 'And all that talk about the things you've got' 'and what you'd do to keep them.' You put that with what you offer to the naked eye.. And, uh, well, can you blame a man? Yes, and I'm still glad I slugged you. - And you still don't like me. - Oh, you're a very smart man. You catch on quickly. Look, why bother taking me home? I want to see those three rooms of yours. I've been wondering what makes them mean so much more to you than anything I've got means to me. Wait. [car door closes] I don't expect you to like it. It looks better to me than it would to others because.. - Well, because... - Because it's yours. Yes, because it's mine. Don't tell me, it was there when we moved into the joint. Look here, Eddie. We let you have it so you'll have a place after marriage. (female) 'The least you can do is pay for damage.' - 'What damage?' - Keep your chin up, kid. Maybe I ought to hang one in your chin? - Maybe you better try it. - 'Eddie.' Hello, honey. You're just in time to get a load of this. - Who are these people? - The people who live here. They say we burnt their cheap table with a cigarette. - I am saying it! - Honey, tell him. 'Was that table burned when we moved in or not?' I-I think we did it, Eddie. Oh, we did, huh? Okay, then you win. Give 'em a couple of bucks, and let's get outta here. Nice people. Loan a guy an apartment and sneak back in the night and move him out. That's what I call doing a guy a favor. - Will $2 be enough? - Mmm. plenty. Sorry to have to move you out, I told him we wanted it today. - I guess he didn't tell you. - Yes, he did, but I forgot. Thanks for letting us use it. It was a lovely apartment. I'll-I'll go pack now. Wait till I give it some light. What a dump! Why do you say that? It's not so bad. It's clean and I'll bet that's a swell bed. Yeah. That's a swell act. But it don't fool, Eddie. 'I know what you're thinking. I'm a heel. You're right.' Yeah, sure, you're terrible. So we lost a funny little apartment. So what of it? Plenty. I know how you felt about that joint. If I was any kind of a guy, you'd have one for keeps. Instead, I give you this. Well, it's better than a lot of people have. Anyway, we're not gonna be in it forever. Soon Swing'll get a big fight. We'll get a better place. So, you see, everything's jake. Only it ain't. I should've told you this before. You've had enough for one night. Might as well unpack these. - What is it, Eddie? - Nothing. Where do these go? Look, if anything's happened, I want you to tell me about it. Well, if you've got to know... I don't own Swing anymore. I lost his contract in a crap game. Oh. Well, start screaming! Tell me you think I'm a crumb. Why? Because a couple of things have gone wrong? Things go wrong with everybody, Eddie. I've still got my job. At least we know we're gonna eat. Hey. Come here. You're a lot of swell woman, baby. And what have I handed you? Grief. Eddie, I don't think there's enough grief in the world to make up for the happiness I've had aldready. Much less of what- what we're gonna have. Right now, I'm tired and I wanna go to sleep. I guess the bathroom's somewhere down the hall. What kind of a time did you have tonight? - Good. - Meet Hennessey? - Yeah. - Some guy, huh? - He's alright. - I told you you'd have fun. Don't I always steer you right? - Who knows what's best for you? - You do, Eddie. [up-tempo dance music] - Got a Jessie Miller here? - Give it over. - What's in it? - Are you Jessie Miller? If it's bad news I can't give it until the final verse. You wouldn't want an officer in the finale of your show. Give it to her now. - Jessie Miller. - Yeah? - For you. A cop brought it. - Cop? You got three minutes to make the change. - Anything the matter? - No, no. Alright, tell me while you getting dressed. Beryl, I gotta have some money. A $100. I can let you have 60 cents. What's happened to Eddie? What makes you think it's for Eddie? What if it is? I've still need it. When are you gonna get wise? It's just a matter of time until he pulls you down to his class. 'Beryl, will you listen once and for all?' 'Eddie took me away from Hester Street. Can't you understand?' A street car could've done that, and cost you less. But you don't know, how nice and sweet he can be. He remembers the things that count. Little things. I'm sick of hearing about men that do the little things. Give me a guy that does a big thing, like paying rent. But not Eddie. You lend him two bucks and he buys you 50 cents of violets. - Where's the profit? - Who cares about profits? There're no bargains between Eddie and me. No cash sales. Whatever we have, we share. That's for profits and losses. It's got something to do with love, hasn't it? - 'Yeah.' - It's a tough argument to beat. [knocking on door] (male) 'Everybody onstage.' After all my screaming, all I've got is advice. - Try Gebhart. - Okay. Uh-huh. I suppose you want some money again? Joe make out a draw slip for five dollars. But I wanted much more than that, Mr. Gebhart. I-I need a $100. You can take it from my salary. In a few days, there ain't gonna be anymore salary. This show is closing. Can't run forever, you know. $100? You're shaking the wrong tree, kid. If you want $100 bills, you better find a millionaire. - How about a little snifter? - No, no snifter. Mike, we're getting out of this place. Remind me to tell Briggs to call a rental agency. - Something wrong with it? - Yeah, it's haunted. Haunted? By a ghost? Yeah. It walks the parapet every night. Mike, forget what I said. We'll stay here. After all, at my age, why should I worry about ghosts? I-I had to see you. Well, for a minute, I wasn't sure. - How are you? - I couldn't go to anyone else. What's the matter? Some kinda trouble? - Yes. - Sit down. Mr. Hennessey, something has happened and.. I've got to have a $100. Aren't you gonna ask me, what's it for? 'No.' Well, there's, there's no reason why you shouldn't know. The show is closing, you're gonna be left high and dry and you came to me for a loan. That's fair enough, isn't it? But you know I want it for something else. Well, if you've got to have it, I suppose Miller's in some jam? Haven't you ever been in any trouble? Plenty. In and out of it all my life. In by myself and out by myself. Alright, Eddie made a mistake. He did wrong. He took bets on horse races, but he did for me. Well, that's a grand old song. - Where is he? - He's in jail. Well, let's get him out of jail. He'll be hungry. He hasn't had any dinner. - Eddie! - Hi, baby. Where've you been? - Well, I-I.. - Oh, I get it. I couldn't get the money any place, so I went Mr. Hennessey. - Got it just like that, huh? - He didn't even ask me why. Well, that's mighty sweet of Mr. Hennessey. It looks like you got the worst of it, Miller. What'll you do? Take a cruise till the scandal blows over. Why? If you didn't have anything in mind, I might find you a spot. Anything, all he wants is a start. Isn't it, Eddie? - Why? - Why what? Why this sudden generosity? Or is this a habit? Going around the courts, picking up guys and giving 'em jobs. - Are you outta your mind? - What makes you throw me this? And way up there on top. Maybe you like my eyes or my neckties. I like nothing. - You've got everything wrong. - Sure, I'm always wrong. - Come on, let's go. - Wait a minute. - Miller, you're a cheap guy. - Now, you're asking for it! - You're still in court. - Step outside and crack 'em. I'll make 'em in Macy's window. You're a small timer. You'll never get big. You were born and raised in Hester Street - and that's where you'll stay. - You shut up! I'll handle this. Look, nobody can deny that a genius like you is only born once in a century. All the kids in school read about how you walk 40 miles to the public library. Or was that Abraham Lincoln? But don't you wish you had what I've got? Come on, kid. Mrs. Miller. I guess I've spoken out of turn. I'm sorry. We all acted a little crazy. I'm sorry too. - Thanks for what you did. - Okay. It was very nice of you. Sergeant, did anybody ever worry whether you had dinner or not? Can't say as they did, Mr. Hennessey? - Me neither. Goodnight. - 'Goodnight.' [telephone grinding] (Jessie) 'Eddie, stop that.' What am I doin' wrong now? I put a penny in it. 'Cause it's me, that's why it don't work. Eddie Miller can't even work a slot machine. You gotta be Hennessey to get a gum. That's nonsense. Hennessey can make sense. Hennessey can make money. You gotta be Hennessey to live. You're having a wonderful time, aren't you? You're so sorry for yourself, you can bust out crying. Taking it out on him, on anything, except yourself. 'Cause he did something nice for you and you couldn't stand it. - Somethin' nice for me. Yeah. - Somethin' nice for you. Yeah. He got you outta jail and offered you a job. I can imagine. Swabbing decks or shoveling coal. Well, he probably started that way. I know all about it. How he saved his pennies. He didn't swear. He was good to his mother. Alright. That was his way. - I'll do it my way. - Okay, Eddie, okay. The spirit of the helping hand. That's Hennessey. Nice lad, Miller. I'd like to help him. Or maybe, I can do alright with his wife. That's enough. If you ask him real fast he wouldn't know whether he was blonde or redhead. I guess you got mutual interests. Like collecting butterflies. Eddie, please let's not talk about it anymore. Don't these trains ever come along? You're tired and so am I. We've, we've still got each other. I suppose that's still enough for you. Yes. Yes, it is. [train approaching] Maybe, it was a mistake getting the money from Mr. Hennessey. I couldn't let you stay in there. I'd have done anything to get you out. (male conductor) '42nd Street.' This is 42nd. The next is us. I'm married to you and there couldn't be anybody else. You should know that. (Jessie) 'Oh, look, Eddie.' They don't care whether anybody sees them or not. Kids don't make any bones about how they feel, do they? We were the same when we were young, remember? [chuckles] (Jessie) 'We're not so old now.' That is, not so very. Sometimes, I feel kind of old. (male conductor) '34th next.' It's because I feel sort of.. Well, responsible for everything, I guess. I dumped myself on you just when you were starting to get ahead. It wasn't fair. 'It wasn't fair to you.' But I hated Hester Street so, and I wanted you. And I couldn't wait any longer. I've waited so long. Oh, gee, they're sweet. Eddie. - Just for your own protection. - What was that? - We're merely suggesting. - That I incorporate.. - 50,000 shares of stock. - To create a reserve fund. What's to be afraid of? 20 years I've stood my own. - Who's to knock me off? - Labor is restless. We should have a reserve fund to take care of emergencies. The boys are right, John. There's trouble in the air. Trouble from whom? You're crazy. My men are twice as well off and twice as happy than any union. It's too nice a day to talk this nonsense. Get out of here. Hey, boys. Wait a minute. I got a little excited. I'm sorry. What are you laughing at? - Little jumpy lately. - Well, what about it? Nothing, I was just wondering.. Wouldn't be a woman, would it? Now, I forgot the number I was gonna call. I tell you, me boy, it's the system that's all wrong. All the money's in certain pockets. And anybody can see that it ain't right. Agree with me there? Well, it ain't my pockets, I know that much. Where have I got after all these years? And where would I've got if I'd had some money to work with in the beginning? [chuckles] Tell us where, pa? Now, nobody asked for any side remarks from you, young man. What you doing with them there cards? A little trick. Always trying to figure out some skin game. You can't get something for nothing in this world. Some people can. When a guy can parley a rowboat into half a dozen steamship lines, he's copping some sneak. Pa could have done it only he never had a rowboat. Once more, young man, and then it's a clout in the head. About you and Jessie, now, Edward.. Have you been figuring on anything? Well, Jessie's been trying to connect with another show but you know how I feel about that. A man don't like to have his wife working. No, no, that's right. A woman's place is in the home. I'm glad to say that Jessie's mother never had to get out and do a day's work. Get out? [chuckles] Ma ain't been outta the house in five years. [sighs] This is a big country, Edward. With enough for everybody to have three square meals a day. Yeah, all you gotta do is get them. All you have to do is to go after them. Now, I'm not going to see you and Jessie going around hungry. And I know some influential people and I can fix it for you. - What's the answer? - Relief. - 'I can fix it'. - 'Oh, relief, huh?' Sure. If the country can't provide you with a job.. Well, they'll certainly owe you a living. Yeah, I know. But that relief business, sorta like charity. Man don't like to take that kinda dough. What is it tonight, as if I didn't know? Frankfurters and sauerkraut. [chuckles] And they call it relief. Jessie, tell your mother it's after seven. What of it? Maybe your mother knows, what time I like to have my dinner. A man oughta run his family like it was an army. And he was a... general. Ma, aren't you ever gonna get this leaky faucet fixed? Repairs cost money, Jessica. Yeah, everything costs money. Everything you want. Even if you don't want very much. There's nothing so hard to get ahold of as a little bit money. Yet, we have to have it. Haven't we? Somehow. If not, it looks as if the future is gonna be the past. - Jessica? - Yeah, Ma. There's some things I've been wanting to tell you. I don't talk much. Maybe I'm kind of not in the habit anymore. - What's it about? - You. You and Eddie. What you got and what you want. You are a woman, Jess. You want to have some say about the life you live. A woman's supposed to lead a man's life. Her man's life. We're made that way, usually. A women's weakness is supposed to fit into a man's strength. Her respect pays for the security a man gives her. That's with most women. Your father doesn't like potatoes with the jackets on. But not you, Jessica. You've got strength of your own. You can do things. Not just dream about them like... like most women. What are you trying to tell me, Ma? Live your life for yourself, Jess. Remember what it was you hated. Always remember what it is you want, did it... anyway you can. If you have to, get it alone. I came from a farm, Pennsylvania. The grass was the greenest you ever saw. We used to make our own butter. I cried myself to sleep in this flat every night for years. Your father was the spitting image of Eddie.. Only handsomer. I... I was pretty too. (Pa) 'How long has the man do wait for his supper?' Coming, Pa. It's stuffy in here. - Warm nights. - One, two, three.. Ain't gonna be warm much longer. - Rent's due Saturday. - Nine, ten.. Imagine paying rent for a dump like this. Gotta get a medal for living in it. We've got enough for coffee and doughnuts in the morning. - Ain't that a thrill. - 21, 22, 23.. Suppose we do pay the rent Saturday, so what? We got to have more than that. We got to get us a good chunk of mazuma right away somewhere. I think you've got an idea there. - 32, 33, 34.. - Maybe I have. - Maybe I got a great idea. - 39, 40, 41. What is it this time? Digging for oil in central park? You're in no mood to hear it. You ain't receptive. Keep brushing your hair. You left off at 42. Suppose we had a chance to take down some big dough. Enough to take us over the hill and set us on the street. What would you do for a chance like that? I'd want to keep out of jail, Eddie. They couldn't put you in jail for this. They couldn't even.. Ah! Forget it. Make believe I never brought it up. Let's get some shut-eye. If there's any chance of getting that money, I wanna know. If it's on the level, I'll do it. I'll do anything. We'd be fixed for life. No more grief, no more worrying. We'd be sitting on a front porch with the white folks. - What's it worth to you? - Anything. - You sure? - You oughta know that by now. Marry Hennessey. - Marry Hennessey? - He is crazy about you. He'd sail in a minute, if you went at it the right way. But you don't mean that, Eddie. You must be kidding. It's being done every day. Pick any newspaper, what do you see? "Jane divorces millionaire after six months, collects plenty." - It's smart stuff. - But, Eddie, I.. I'm married to you, Eddie. That's easy. Look, I do a quick fade out. You get a divorce, and in six months, we're in the money. Don't look at me like that. Anybody'd think I'd run a knife into you. What does it mean? In six months, you're back with me. - And we'll have all the money. - Stop it. - We could get a 100 grand. - Stop it! - We'll be set forever. - Stop it! Well, you asked for it, and I gave it to you. It's the only way I know. The only way you know. And who knows best? Eddie, I know that look in your eyes. You're saying, what did I do wrong now? You didn't do anything wrong, Eddie. You never have I guess, for you. And you never will, because.. You don't do things for the same reasons as other people. You don't even live in the same world. 'You got one all for yourself'. A world by, for, and with Eddie Miller. Nobody's gonna ever share your life, are they, Eddie? They're just gonna help you live it. - Isn't it, Eddie? - I guess so, yeah. You're agreeing because it's the easiest way out of a spot. No, I'm not. This is been coming up for a long time. When we were kids, you'd wanna save up pennies for movies. I'd wanna sneak in the back way. You'd say, "I was wrong", and I'd say "Well I got in, right?" I grew up like that. Everybody telling me I was wrong. And me knowing, I was right. So now, that's the way I am. But, if you was to give me a chapter a day maybe I'd know the whole thing before long. It's an awful long book, Eddie. You'd get bored. So, you're gonna walk out on me? No, Eddie. You walked out on me. Women are weak and men are strong. My mother wasted a lifetime of strength trying to prove that. Goodbye, Eddie. [door shuts] - They've gone out. - Who's gone, where? The Long Sherman of San Francisco, they walked out. I knew it. Don't those guys ever learn to settle a strike? You can't get along in the shipping business without longshoremen. - Get Sullivan San Francisco. - 'There's a Ms. Cassidy, sir.' Cassidy? Never heard her. I hate to bring up the matter of surplus we haven't got. - Don't be silly. - Seattle will be out by night. [intercom buzzes] (female on phone) 'San Francisco is ready.' Ms. Cassidy, asked me to give you this in a message. She said you'd know, There's a $100 in it. A hu.. - Where is she? - She's left, Mr. Hennessey. Yes, but San Francisco, John. You take it, I forgot what I was gonna say. Hey. What's the idea of Ms. Cassidy? You're using an alias now? - You know, that's my name now. - Oh. Oh. Tell me about it. Well, how long has this been going on or rather off? - About three months. - Three months? Well, why wasn't I told about it? - Three... smoke? - No, thanks. Three months is a long time. Lot of things could've happened. I wanted to wait until I could bring the money back. - Sure you won't need it again? - No, thanks. Never again. So you finally got wise? Or don't you want to talk about it? Look, can't we just say things didn't work out? We can do better than that. We won't even remember things. Suppose we start at dinner tonight at Louise. Mock turtle soup and Gefilte fish? I've had this planned a long time. I am sorry, Mr. Hennessey. I can't. - Tomorrow night? - No. - Maybe the next night? - No, no night at all. Any particular reason? Well, it's.. It's just that I'm alone now, and I want to stay that way. If you change your mind, where could I call you? If I change my mind, I'll call you. What for are you working? Maybe I could help. That's just it, no. Well, you can't say that I don't take punishment. You've got a great straight left there. You're the kind of girl that doesn't change her mind. I guess I'm not doing so good. I just want to bring back the money I borrowed. You've been swell and I appreciate everything you've done and tried to do. So, let's-let's let it stay like that, please. So, it's hello and goodbye, Jessie Cassidy. It's hello and goodbye, J L. Hennessey.. With thanks. Oh, and don't bother phoning the elevator man. I'm going to walk down this time. Sullivan says things are a mess. He wants you to go to the coast. Briggs, I wanna send a field of violets to Ms. Jessie Cassidy. Not a bunch, a field, about an acre and a half. This wouldn't have happened if gefilte fish wasn't invented. - Hmm? - I said, what's the address? I don't know the address, Briggs, yet. But every time I find her, she goes and moves. What do you expect? She'll put out a flag or shoot sky-rockets? - She's smart. - Yes, sir. - You know an Eddie Miller? - Yeah, why? - He's here. You wanna see him? - Yeah, send him in. Now, you find that girl. If you cant, get a detective. - But I am a detective. - The crack still goes. - What's on your mind, Miller? - A lotta things. Some of 'em ain't so easy to say. Don't tell me there's anything that isn't easy for you. Still don't rate so good with you, huh? - Nope. - You and Jessie, both. Me and the kid ain't together anymore. - You probably know that. - Yeah, she told me. - Been seein' her a lot? - Once, weeks ago. You said you had something to tell me. Did, uh, did Jessie tell you why we split up? (Hennessey) 'No.' I'll tell you why. It's because I couldn't take it anymore. - 'You couldn't take what?' - Hennessey, that's what. Why ain't I more like Hennessey? I had to work like you, look like you, think like you. After a while, I began to figure things out. (Eddie Miller) 'I figured, maybe, Jessie wasn't in love with me anymore" Oh. Well, I still don't know why you came here tonight. 'Cause Jessie was right. And so were you. That's what I came here to tell you, first. Second, I hear you've been trying to find her. (Eddie Miller) 'She's working as a mannequin at Trinette's and Park Avenue.' 'And since you were both so right' 'maybe a couple of right people ought to get together.' - Alright, what's your angle? - What do you mean, angle? Don't give me that. I know you got some cheap chisler working. I wanna know what it is. How do you like that? A guy tries to do the right thing and he gets called a chisler. Alright, wise-guy, forget it. Say hello to the kid for me. - How'd it go? - Okay. You know, Smooch, he's a smart guy. You can't pay rent in there with sawdust. That joint must be full of smart people. Yeah, and you know who's as smart as any of them? Eddie Miller. All my life they been telling me I'm wrong. I still know I'm right. Hello? Hello, Briggs? Did I wake you up, Briggs? Oh, well, that's too bad. Say, Briggs, what does a fella wear to a fashion show? Huh? Striped pants? What, are you kidding? Thanks. [serene orchestral music] For a luncheon. [music continues] Lunch sounds great. Will you wear what you've got on? No. A hostess motif for afternoon tea. [music continues] I've never had afternoon tea. Will you wear that gown? No. For dinner. [music continues] Now, uh, dinner is something I know about. You've got on just the right clothes for gefilte fish. No. For my ladies' good work. No. [John chuckling] This is very pleasant, Mr. Hennessey. Let's take care of that Hennessey thing right away. The first name is John or Jack. I like "John". What does the "L" stand for? I don't know. What does the "L" stand for in John L. Sullivan? That's who I was named after. I imagine the old man was full of beer at the time. - Say it again, will you? - What? Oh, John L. Sullivan Hennessey. John, for short. Sounds like something I've wanted to hear for a long time. Let's go to work on that basis. First, about your clothes. Will you go and get whatever you want at Trinette's? And, uh, what kind of a car do you like? I was afraid of something like that. It's been a lovely evening, Mr. Hennessey. Can I go home? Wait a minute. I-I forgot the most important thing, didn't I? What I meant to say was, uh.. Would you marry me? - Well, I... - Please, don't thank me. A woman always thanks a man who proposes to her if she doesn't wanna marry him. I wasn't gonna thank you. - Don't laugh. - I wasn't gonna laugh. You weren't, by any chance, going to say "yes?" - No. - What were you gonna do? I-I don't know. Take a drink of water, light a cigarette or something. I don't know. It's a tough spot when a man you don't love asks you to marry him, isn't it? Yeah. Well, uh, shall we dance? That will give you something to do while I talk about. [ballroom music] - Pretty music, isn't it? - Yeah. A man can't look at you and say what he thinks. You mind puttin' your head back where it was. It all started when you slugged me. Like somebody hit me with a hypodermic needle full of love. And it's pretty bad now, Jessie. It's getting worse. I'm afraid it's one of those incurable things. How often have you been in love that way? I've never been in love. I'm not even sure that I'm in love with you now. I know that I feel things and I-I call them love because I think, maybe, that's what they are. What sort of things? I want to give you everything with nothing in return. And I know that no matter how long we live I won't have time to do all the things. And I'm not afraid because you don't.. I mean, I-I think that I have enough of whatever it is for both of us. And I know if I don't have you, I won't have nothing. Would you call that love? I wouldn't know, John. I've never been in love. Oh. It seems they're playing that song again. Really? I hadn't noticed. [grandeur music] [knock on door] Ready. Hi, Jess. Hello, Eddie, how are you? Won't you come in? Thanks, Jess, I will. Take off your hat and sit down. What do you want? I got a date with President Roosevelt and Congress. And I don't wanna keep 'em waiting. What do you want? It's all about, honesty is the best policy and don't chisel people if you don't want people to chisel you. Violets are in season again. - For the blushing bride. - Thanks. Will you tell me what you came here for? Maybe I came to tell you how much I love you. Maybe to ask you, "Can you lend me 5 bucks?" or "Can I be the one to give the bride away?" But I'm not. 'I came here to tell you, you can't get away with it.' With what? Don't give me those big blue eyes. You know what. Marrying Hennessey. Oh. Oh, I get it. You mean, I stole your idea. I thought your idea of marrying Hennessey for six months in for a lot of money was good that I wanted it for myself. What else? Trouble with you is, Eddie, that every where you look you look into a mirror. Everything you think about and everybody who know you.. You think of in terms of your own cheapness. I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I don't wanna look at you anymore. You're not gonna go into that routine again. - 'Get out of here.' - Why're you marrying Hennessey? If I'm not being too cheap for asking. I suppose you're in love with him. You spent the nights drawing circles in the sand and telling him about the moon and the stars. And he chased you down the stairs beggin' you to marry him. He'd do anything for you if you'd take him outta his misery. 'Get apt to yourself, Jess. Get honest.' Maybe I'm lookin' at mirrors, maybe everybody is the way I'm. 'And maybe I'm just the guy that knows it.' Alright, Eddie, maybe that's it. You're agreeing with me to get out of a spot. Only, I'm not finished. Go ahead and marry Hennessey. Go to Europe, have fun. 'Get used to being Mrs. Big-shot.' 'When you come back, I'll be here.' And you'll pay off. Get it? I wanna be paid off. I'm not marrying John that way. Believe me, Eddie. The point is, will he believe me when I tell him, it did. He's gonna put a lot of things together and get a wrong answer. Look, Eddie, I'm not in love with him and he knows it. 'He doesn't care because he's in love with me.' He'd never get over if I'd let you hurt him. I'd rather walk out and I will. Remember that, Eddie. I wonder. [knock on door] Ready, Jess? Just leaving, Mr. Hennessey. Just dropped in to say good luck andbon voyage, to the kid here. 'Same to you.' So long, Jessie. Ready, darling? Ready. [grandeur music] Divorce, married and everything. Now, where? This is gonna hurt me more than it is you but there is a very famous saying... Some cheap objection to three on a honeymoon. What are you? Old fashioned? Mrs. Hennessey thanks you and I thank you. Goodbye, darling. Save enough to get home. Good luck, kid. Only, you won't need it this time. You hit the jackpot. You got something here, friend. I'd say you deserved her. Only, I don't think any man's worth any woman. Imagine, I can afford a honeymoon without a husband. - Au revoir. - Bye. - Hey! - Huh? Do you know that we're married, you and me? That's what the interpreter said the man said. Wanna go to Egypt and buy snakes? - That sounds fun. - And then where? - Venice? - Venice? Mm-hmm. - Moscow? - Yes. Budapest? Vienna? Minsk? Spince? Jakarta? Milwaukee? St. Bart's? And now, Ireland. The greenest grass that ever grew. I wanna go where the policemen come from. We're gonna go where the Hennessey's grown. Hmm, nice people, the Hennesseys. Always lived in a little white house at the end of the street. Lovely woman, Mrs. Hennessey. I've always heard it's Mr. Hennessey that's nicest. Isn't that funny, I don't know how things like that get around. As a matter of fact, he's kinda low-down. Came from no-place, climbed a mountain, found her at the top. - Just a lucky guy. - A swell guy. You are, you know? An awful swell guy, John. Well, what brought all this on? Nothing. Can't I cry if I want to? [chuckles] Sure. [both chuckling] [pleasant music] Mornin' to you, honey. Haven't you learned to stop that bicycle yet? How do you like this skimmer? Do I look like a spalpeen or not? What is it? Something to lay eggs in? That's it, I'm not gonna tell you what I brought you. What is it? [John mumbling gibberish] Which one's that? That's "I love you" in, uh, Russian. I keep getting it mixed up with the one we learned in Vienna. - What are you making? - A cake. - Any good? - I hope so. Not bored yet? Bored? With what? With these three rooms. Just chock-full of atmosphere. Are you? Me? With you? You're crazy? I could live in a phone booth. Then that's settled. You sure, darling? It seems so little for you. It's such a big world, so many things in it I want you to have. No. I want my world to end down there. Where the road turns into the woods. What'd you bring me? I'll tell you later. I got this, though from the post office, for you. A cablegram? From whom? I don't know, darling, it's for you. I'll save it and we'll read it together after dinner. - What if it's bad news? - Then we'll cry about it. - If it's good news? - Then well laugh about it. John L. Hennessey, I'll have my present now and no foolin'. - Well, uh, it's, uh... - Go on! I said I'd have it now! Well it's kinda silly, it's uh.. Aww, violets. Yeah, they were so beautiful. I thought maybe you'd think they were pretty, too, from me. I've never seen any in my whole life that were prettier. You know, I finally found out the secret of the Irish? It's these crazy clay pipes. Can't get 'em lit. Even if you do get 'em lit, they won't stay lit. If they do stay lit, they burn your tongue. If they burn your tongue, you bite the stem. If you bite the stem, you swallow the pipe. If you swallow the pipe, you're in trouble. If you're in trouble, you're an Irishman. A vicious circle. They're wonderful for blowing soap bubbles. Soap bubbles? Oh, I get it. I thought, all that time, I was smoking dirt. Did you ever watch a soap bubble grow? When it's little, it's strong... and steady. The bigger it gets, the shinier and shakier it gets. But it keeps reaching and stretching to get bigger and then... back to soap suds. The moral must be "Stop on the way up." That's right. You can move ahead if you like, you don't have to go back. Well, that's alright for lady soap bubbles, but you know there's something in a man that makes him want to go ahead. Makes him wanna see how big he can get without busting. There's something in a man that makes him wanna build a home. To put a family in it. To keep it warm and safe. Yeah, there's that in a man, too. You haven't read your cablegram, don't you think you'd better? Yeah. - Mr. Briggs. - Briggs? What does he want? He says everything's fine and he hopes we're very happy. Briggs knows how it is with me. He was the only one till you came along. You see, Jessie, I've worked a lifetime to build something. And now I have, and it's become bigger than I am. And I couldn't just stand still and watch it fall to pieces at my feet, because along the way I picked up responsibilities there are those who look to me for the things they wanna build. 'I can't let them down.' 'You understand?' Everything I want in life is around me this minute here. And everything I hate is back there. But it isn't my life any longer, is it? It's yours. 'Cause I love you. We've got to go back, John. [fog horn blowing] - Hello, Martin. - Hello. - Hi. - Hiya, Briggs. - Mrs. Hennessey. - Hello, how are you? - Hello, Mike. - Hello. Well, Briggs, let's have the bad news. They've walked out, John, every man, Jack with them. Ten days ago, they're meeting now at Seaman's hall. Alright, we'll take it in. Do you mind going home with Mike? No, of course, not. - No riots, now. - No riots, unless I start 'em. - Come, Briggs. - Glad to see you back. Thanks, Mike. I'm glad to be back, I.. (Mike) 'The baggage is all taken care of.' Home from here? No, you go ahead, I'll take a cab, I have a meeting. Yes, ma'am. You saw me pick up 60 bucks today, didn't you? 60 bucks. If a man really hustled he could make himself four-five hundred a week. And what can they do? Nothing. The labels are phony but the stuff is perfume. Ten cents a quart it costs us. [knock on door] Cover up, quick. Yeah. Forgot I locked it. (Eddie) 'Oh, hello.' 'Come in, kid.' Honey, this is Smooch Hanrahan. Smooch, this is, uh, Mrs. Smith. Mind taking a walk for a couple of minutes? - You know how it is. - Yeah, sure. Say, maybe you could fix up a little party tonight. You know, with a friend. Just the four of us? You must've come right from the boat. 'How'd you know I was still in this dump?' - You'll always be here, Eddie. - Not always. Let me take a look at you, close up. A million bucks, no less. I've come to tell you to lay off John and me. - Just like that, you're... - I wouldn't ask for anything. Not anymore, you wouldn't. Right now, I couldn't buy you a pair of shoes. But I remember when I gave you plenty. Now I want some of what you've got. - It isn't mine to give. - 'It's yours to take.' - You've no right to it. - I can get it. If you went to him, he'd know you were lying. - He'd throw you in the street. - That's home to me. He'd laugh at you and he'd know you are a cheap blackmailer. What are you getting excited about? You're gonna have a big laugh, you and him. - So what are you worried about? - I'll tell you what. It's something you wouldn't know. I'm in love with the swellest guy I've ever known. He always has been. It has a funny effect on you, love has. It makes you want to give and not take. Sounds wonderful. Almost like a fairy story. Swinging through life together, hand in hand. What's it worth to you? I knew that was coming even before you said it. Even before I came here. You needn't bother going to John because when you do, I won't be there, he won't know where I am. It's gonna hurt him... and me as long as I can remember. But I'm gonna be the one to do it, not you. I'm gonna walk out on him. That's what it's worth to me. 'Jess.' You wouldn't be kiddin' me, would ya'? I've never kidded you for one minute. - I'm pretty much of a heel. - Yes, Eddie, you are. We've talked about that once before. I cant help it. It's the way I am. I don't believe you'll walk out on him, Jess. So, I'm coming up to collect. It's too bad. Yeah... it's too bad for you and me, and everybody. (John) Well, boys, what's the trouble? Come on, come on, tell me about it. Well, if you haven't got any troubles you can talk about I don't think you've got any troubles. So, I'll suppose we all go back to work. If you're getting enough money for too many hours send your delegate up and we'll fix it. We've done it all before. So that settles that, huh? Well, does it or doesn't it? 'Tim, you've always spoken up. What about this?' 'Are you for it or against it?' 'Scotty, Abe, Rocko, how about this?' But men, you can't do this. Every nickel we've got in the world is tied up in those boats. We've built them up through years of hard work. You can't throw them away for something you won't talk about! Well, why don't you say something? If there's a man here who has something against me let him come up here and tell me what it is. It ain't you, John. It's the others. We're out on account of them. We gotta stick together to win their fight. But it's their fight. Why take it out on yourselves? Why take it out on me? I've always split everything I've got with you. Don't you see, there won't be anything to split if you're out? I haven't got a nickel of reserve capital. I tell ya', every dime I've got is tied up in those boats. If I'm bankrupt, you're bankrupt. Men, can't you see what you're doing? Can't you see what you've done? Okay. So that's the way its gotta be, huh? Okay, fellas. John. We would not do this to you for anything, but we can't help it. Look, I would like to work too. You say you'll be bankrupt. I'm sorry, John. My little boy didn't have any supper last night. And... so.. Who was it once said "There's always something doing in the lives of famous men?" The sale of the ships will take care of the forfeits on the contracts. Adding the final touch is easy. All you do is sign your name. Sounds quite simple. And there you have it. But, its been fun. Sort of like playing with building blocks. I guess, a kid must feel pretty awful when someone knocks over his little house. [melancholic music] I've always liked this window, looking out over the city. Sort of a nice feeling goes with that. Makes a man feel he's on top. It's been a nice, big window. Gets dark early these nights, doesn't it? And when night comes, a man goes home. - You smiling, Briggs? - No. You never thought I'd get going home, huh? That shows that there are great many things going on that you know nothing about, Briggs. Right now, I'm what you might call a "stable citizen." Yes, sir, that's me now. And it's nice to know that when the worst comes a man doesn't have to go it alone. I've got something there, haven't I, Briggs? I guess, a man could do without a lotta things for a bit of that, John. And never miss 'em. Goodnight, Briggs. Goodnight, John. I'll see you, boy. [music continues] Hello, Macushla. I'm sorry I'm late, but I was very busy. Darling, there's something you've got to know about. It'll take quite a lot of telling. But it's a little for Christmas, isn't it? Why, Jessie? I wasn't going to be here when you got it. That's what it says, but it doesn't say why. I'm taking nothing but the things I have on. - Is it something I've done? - No, John. - Is it something you've done? - No. Must there be a reason for everything? Well, things like this just don't happen. A man's life just doesn't walk out the front door like that. A woman's life does, though. Please, Jessie, tell me what it is. Things just haven't worked out with us, John, leave it at that. Oh, no. Not this time. Because they have worked out. You've made me happier than I ever thought I could be. - And I've made you happy. - Have you? The door. [doorbell ringing] Let it ring. Jessie, I've loved you with my whole heart, you know that. Every time I've looked at you, I've touched you, you knew it. [doorbell ringing] And I think, in the end, you loved me too. You did love me, didn't you, Jessie? Let's say that I tried very hard. That was our agreement, wasn't it, that I was to try? And I did try, so hard that sometimes I kidded myself into believing I really did love you, but.. But I don't, John. I know that I couldn't love you any more than I do right now. I'm glad I've made you happy. Might wanna remember that in case you ever wanna remember anything about us. It isn't as though we didn't know what we were getting into. It was sort of a business agreement, that's all from the very beginning. Well, let's end it like one. Partnerships dissolve when they don't work out. It happens all the time. We both got what we started with and maybe a little bit more. Isn't that so? Goodbye, John. [dramatic music] I rang the bell, but nobody answered. So I tried the door, and it wasn't locked. - What do you want? - Just dropped in. If you're busy, I'll come back another time. No. This is the time. What is it? What a reputation I've got. Always after something. Well, I came to pay my respects to the bride and groom. I'd have brought a present, but Tiffany's is closed at night. And besides, you probably don't need a gravy bowl. You two don't need anything. You've got each other. That's enough. Remember that circle you drew in the sand, Jess? Draw another one now, around you and him. And don't let this one wash out on you. That's what I came to say. Good luck. Wait a minute, Eddie. You haven't turned noble on us, have you? Who me? Haven't you read the papers? The guy's broke. He's flat, washed up. Me and Hennessey are in the same gutter now. Only, I know all the warm places. Miller. What does my going broke got to do with you being noble? Nothin' much. Just somethin' Jess and I had figured out once. Somethin' we were countin' on. What is this? The way you look at me, I was some kind of a trap. Go on, get out. What was it you both figured out once? - Nothing. - What were you counting on? - Nothing. - You won't tell me anything. - You want me to guess? - No. No, I should have told you. I started to, a dozen times, but.. I thought it was something you never had to know. I left Eddie because he wanted me to marry you and walk out with a lot of money and I wouldn't. - 'Wouldn't you?' - No, I wouldn't. Then why did you marry me? - 'You were in love with me.' - We're not talking about that. You made a point of looking me up. - To return the hundred dollars. - So you told me. I tried to find you. He told me where you were. I didn't know anything about that. Of course, not. I found him with you Just before we left for Paris. I didn't have anything to do with that. In Ireland, you were happy, the perfect life. You didn't wanna come back. You didn't want to come back because you didn't wanna payoff. And when we did come back, it was to save your investment. - Have you finished? - I haven't even started. But this makes going broke a pleasure. I had no idea it was going to be funny, but it's a panic. After all you've been through after months of being my wife you wind up behind the eight ball. What a laugh. Now, get out. Get out while I'm still laughing. I won't go. I'm clean, washed up, in the gutter. And he knows all the warm places. If you hurry, you can catch him. Not me. I've got a job to do. - Talk fast. - I'll talk as I please. You've got a wonderful case worked up against me. Women have been hanged for less. I won't even start to explain. We've got plenty of time for that. - Just forget all of it. - Not all about it. I'll be reminding you of it for the rest of your life. - Are they clear? - Yeah. They're yours. The point is, are they yours if you want them? - Mmm-hmm. - Good. We'll hock 'em the first thing. They're waste of money anyways. It'll give us enough to start on. Give us enough for three rooms. Then you go to work. Do you hear me? You go to work! All that being washed up in the gutter. You oughta be ashamed of yourself. You start tomorrow morning. What you did once you can do again. Are you listening to me? Me, I-I'm gonna be around all the time. I'm gonna take care of you. I'm gonna see you don't get so big, you burst. Am I? Am I, John? There you go, slugging me again. Well, it worked the last time. [grandeur music]
