"We are delighted to confirm your admission to - - The College Of Advanced Technology." Our Father who art in heaven - - may You always be with my son, Peter Andreas - - who is now leaving his childhood home. May he never forget the plight of life - - or his obligation to You, Almighty Lord. Let him not be tempted by the decay of city life - - and lay not up for himself treasures, where moth and rust doth corrupt. As is Thy will, all that are bred and born in darkness - - will one day appear, and sentence shall be passed upon them. Amen. I have saved up some money - - which I meant to give to you when you left home. But since you have chosen a different path... ...you get nothing. You will, however, get a gift. This watch, which my father gave to me on the day that I left home - - I give to you, in the hope that it will soothe your hardened heart. And open your obstinate mind. When, one day, you turn away from the path to perdition - - you will open your misguided heart to us. - And to Our Lord in Heaven. - It's pitiful to watch an old vicar... ...whom I've only known for his inhuman rigour, seem so sentimental. - You cannot refuse... - What? Father's self-righteous piety? This gift of grace? Apologise. Apologise for what you said! Never! Hit me again. Hit me again like you normally do. Beware! Beware His intrepid curse! Since Father is predicting my future, he should know that in this house - - I've always felt like a stranger and a homeless person. - Exiled be he who defies The Lord! - Amen! Peter? Peter Andreas? Here is a little something for the journey. And remember, if you need help, your older brother is in Copenhagen. Thank you, Mother. ROOM TO LET This is it. The rent is due every first in the month. In Darcy's Law, we see a crucial coherence in proportionality - - between the water flow in the ground and the elevation difference - - between two points. But what constitutes this coherence? Yes? There is an exponential coherence between the acreage and the water flow. A proportional coherence. The larger the acreage, the larger the water flow. What are you doing, Mr. Sidenius? It's a system of canals - - which will cut through Jutland and connect the two oceans. It will shorten shipping travel and connect the new towns. In the middle of class? Have I not asked you to refrain from conducting - - these foolish, conceited experiments? The canals will branch off to the marshy areas - - which can be drained and made cultivable by using Darcy's Law. Listen, Mr. Sidenius... A young man like you - - needs no other ambition than that of acquiring knowledge. Understood? Yes, sir! Do you have any work available? - Only for one night. - Thank you. I'm studying for an engineering degree. I needed some money. Unfortunately, they only needed me for one night. - Do you often pick up random objects? - No, it's for a project of mine. - What did you do before? - You're a curious soul. - I used to be a model. - Really? - For fashion magazines? - Stop it, you nitwit. I posed at The Academy of Fine Arts. - Like... Do you mean naked? - Of course. - For men too? - Of course! You really are a nitwit. There were only men present. It was fun. I would tease them by applying lipstick and painting my eyelashes. Really? Venice went from being an insignificant city - - to one of the world's largest commercial centres - - because they built a sophisticated canal system. I’m calculating how to turn Esbjerg into a lagoon city - - with elevated trading posts. Imagine electrical gondolas sweeping through the streets of Esbjerg - - carrying travellers and their goods. Duty-free, of course. Right, nitwit! No more engineering stories. He's smiling at you! It's peculiar how older men are attracted to you. Please be quiet. But he'd not be a bad partner. And consider your age, Jakobe. You can't live like a nun forever. Besides, he's wealthy. So he wouldn't take you for your money. Please be quiet, Nanny! I enjoyed spending the summers in Denmark with my family. But when the cold set in, I wanted to go back to Switzerland to the fresh air. How long did you attend the girls' school, Miss Salomon? Five years. I made friends from all over the world. Jakobe speaks six languages and has a degree in literature and history. I see. Mr. Ivan, I understand that you've decided to seek out new talent. - That's very commendable. - Yes. The future lies with the young. We're always looking for new investment opportunities. But why do we have to contend with - - the ill-mannered and failed geniuses you keep bringing home? Mr. Salomon... Most humbly, I wondered if I might talk with you in private? Of course, Mr. Eybert. Let's withdraw to another room. I owe you an explanation as to why I’m really here. It involves... I don't know how to phrase it. It involves... ...the state of my heart. Would it be presumptuous of me to ask for some water or coffee? Agnes? Please pour Mr. Eybert some more coffee. Thank you. Where were we? Oh, yes! The state of my heart. It's my intention to honour Miss Jakobe with my affection. Mr. Eybert, of course my wife and I have noticed where things are headed. You come from good Jewish stock and are also a friend of the family, so... Let me not mince matters. I assume you've considered the disparity in years between you and my daughter. Hasn't that coffee been sufficiently stirred now? Oh, yes. I also assume you've considered my daughter's position in life. And my testamentary dispositions regarding her. The state of her finances has not been decisive in this. As I said, it concerns the state of my heart... You know that I hold you in high esteem - - so of course, in principle, you have my blessing. However, ultimately Jakobe decides her own future. I have something which might interest you. A book, or rather, the Holy Bible. It was a gift from the vicar who conducted my confirmation. - A prominent man, rector Sidenius. - How do I know it's not stolen? He dedicated it to me on the front page. "Always observe the strict laws of the Church." 15 øre. 15 øre? I imagined... I would have thought... - Excuse me? - Yes? - Who is that gentleman over there? - Ivan Salomon. - Salomon? - Have you not heard of the Salomons? No. - The bill, please. - Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir? May I steal a moment of your time? My name is Peter Andreas Sidenius. I study engineering. I hear that you're looking for people with ideas. Geniuses. I would like to present a couple of my inventions to you. - May I sit down? - Please. I've thought of a new way of winning energy. Instead of using expensive coal, we could utilise nature's own power - - the wind and the waves. With a sophisticated system of canals and locks, it will revolutionise... Your receipt. This will turn Denmark into a modern, self-sufficient industrial nation. And I was told that... you're the person to involve in such a project. - Do you come here often? - No, I... Then we can continue our talk at some other point. You must excuse me. I have a meeting. He was right there! I've never seen anything like it. His elegant clothes, his whole... His is one of the richest families in the country. Stinking rich. This could be the chance of a lifetime. Mr. Engineer... Come here. By the way, I was thinking... Could you lend me some money? How do I know if I'll ever get it back? You know you can trust me. The thing is... I need to go back to the café, in case he shows up again. It's important. Have you considered, that if you and I joined forces... ...and found a place to live, everything would be so much easier. Yes. That's a great idea. - So will you lend me the money? - Sure. - You can have my tips from tonight. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. This is what I could take home. The customers ate most of the red cabbage. But there's plenty of roast pork. And as many caramelised potatoes as you can eat. To think, this is our first Christmas together. Thank you. I understand if you're thinking about your family. No, quite the opposite. I was thinking about Ivan Salomon. Sometimes, I wish I were rich. Yes, but you aren't, Lisbeth. And you never will be. But what if I was? I would donate all the money to your project. I completely forgot... - Cheers. - Cheers. To you and me. Mr. Sidenius! There you are! Come and sit down. I’ve asked my friends from The College of Advanced Technology about you. - Are you hungry? - No, l... - Caviar and champagne, please! - Yes, sir. Well, Mr. Sidenius... Sit down. Sit down and tell me about your project. Well... Society needs someone like you. Someone who proves that the unique and ground-breaking is possible. I'm currently calculating the required water flow proportionate to acreage. How to connect streams and lakes via canals. You create an irrigation system and utilise uncultivated meadows. - At the same time... - Please stop, Mr. Sidenius. Come to my house for dinner. I want my father to hear your brilliant ideas. - But... - Let's be on first name terms. - Ivan. - Peter Andreas. The project must be submitted to - - Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav from the Danish Society of Engineers. He can recommend it to the ministry, which in turn can endorse it. You're a bit of a world conqueror. You're truly... ...a fortunate man. I’m sorry I’m late. I was busy securing our family's future. You're drunk! Let me introduce you to my sister Nanny. This is Mr. Sidenius. Mr. Sidenius studies engineering, but is already a genius. Well, I never! What does being a genius feel like? Eh... Are you just going to stand there? Be careful, you don't freeze to the spot and turn into a lamppost. I live in that direction. I’ve invited Mr. Sidenius to dinner on Sunday. Well, I'll see you then, Mr. Genius. Remember to turn your feet around, if you're going in the other direction. Don't forget to submit the project to the Engineer Colonel! It's crucial! Hello. I wish to hand this project to the Engineer Colonel himself. The Engineer Colonel is in a meeting. But if you give me the drawings - - we'll contact you when the Engineer Colonel has seen them. Are you sure...? I was thinking perhaps... - Right. - Thank you. - Will he look at all those drawings? - Yes. Thank you. There we go... And, if you don't mind, I'll just pull out your cuff. There we go. And the other one. You've probably wondered about the condition of my clothes. You see, I've just returned from a long stay in Panama - - where I oversaw construction of a large canal system. - Quite dangerous, I'm sure. - Indeed. - This is for you. - Thank you. Well... That's impossible... I think I left my wallet at the hotel. I’m sorry. Why don't I send my chauffeur over with the money? He'll be here within the hour. Good day to you. You cannot leave the shop without paying. Are you accusing me of being a fraudster? Do you know who I am? Hello. My name is Peter Andreas Sidenius. I have an appointment. Welcome inside. - Let me take your hat. - Thank you. Follow me. Please have a seat here. Managing director Delft. I’m the uncle of the family. - Sidenius. - Ah, the young engineer! My nephew told me about you. A fortunate man, he calls you. Not a very flattering name in my opinion. What is it they say...? Fortune favours fools. - May I sit down? - Please. My niece is very agreeable, don't you think, Mr. Sidenius? Miss Salomon is beautiful. Very beautiful. She is certainly not a common girl. And I can assure you, she attracts a large number of young men. What beauty is capable of! Besides, my brother-in-law Philip Salomon is not without means. Because money, Mr. Sidenius, is a magnetic force. Those little pieces of metal evoke the deepest human emotions - - and the noblest excitement of the heart. Am I not right? Well... Let's say hello to the family. Thank you. There you are! You are anxiously awaited. Father? This is Mr. Sidenius, who I told you about. - Welcome. - Thank you. - This is my mother. - Welcome. You have a very beautiful house, Mr. Salomon. And the wine is exquisite. And the ladies... You're surrounded by beautiful ladies. Cheers, Mr. Salomon, and thank you for letting me visit. This is my oldest sister, Jakobe. - Hello. - Hello. Maybe you could tell us about your project, Per? My father is curious to hear. My starting point is... As modern society evolves - - the access to energy sources will be crucial. And he who holds the key to supply, also holds the key to the future. We must break away from coal-based energy, which won't last forever - - and instead harness the massive force and energy which is found in nature. Yes. Please continue. Let's look at the infinite rows of waves - - that discharge their roaring power on the coast every day. Why not harness that power? I want to accumulate that power and connect it to huge turbines - - so that electricity can be sent out to the whole country via cables. The same goes for windmills. All that untapped, restless wind which... ...whistles through the country, can be harnessed and be of benefit to everyone. Imagine, Mr. Salomon, whole cities with houses and long streets - - railway stations and factories, all illuminated by electric light - - which we've harvested from the wind and the sea. You also mentioned something about a new, international seaport. - If you imagine a Danish Venice... - Thank you. That's splendid. And quite expensive, I imagine. How do you imagine implementing this project? The drawings have been handed to Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav. Father knows him. So fingers crossed. Goodnight. Your friend's ideas are fascinating. But he seems like a dreamer. He may be immature, but he's an intelligent man. I was particularly impressed by his predictions - - that he who controls the energy, holds the power and money. But is he someone we want to be acquainted with? Doesn't he seem a bit disingenuous? What's that word...? A scatterbrain. I found him to be boorish. Did you see how much he had to drink? Yes, he seemed slightly ill-mannered. In his defence, remember that he grew up poor. The son of a clergyman. It's sad to see how being poor leaves ugly scars on a person. And he wasn't as handsome as you said, Nanny. I find him unusually handsome. I find him totally magnificent. Magnificent? The Engineer Colonel will see you now, Mr. Sidenius. Excuse me, are you the engineer Sidenius? - Yes. - Good God! You're so young! Well, let's talk about it. I find your idea of hydroelectric turbines to be utter madness. But some of your solutions in wind power seem quite sensible. How did you ever come up with this preposterous project? I have spent the past year on it. But it's something I’ve been thinking about ever since I was a boy. Are these your drawings? Let's have a look. I'd like you to elaborate on the control system for fiords and canals. - Please speak in a clear voice. - Yes, sir. I want to construct a control system for harbours and fiords in Jutland. This would enable faster waterborne travel - - which could turn Denmark into a modern industrial nation. I want to move shipping traffic out of Copenhagen. A free port here would never become a centre for world trade - - as the location of the city makes it hard-to-reach for international vessels. I want to establish a large port on the west coast - - which would enable us to compete with Hamburg and Bremen. It would be a kind of a Venice of the North. You are of a fortunate age. And speaking of which, young man, posture. Straighten your back. Let's meet again in a week. - Am I dismissed? - Excuse me? What a blithering fool! Authoritarian jerk! "Posture, young man! Straighten your back!" I know the tune. Clean nails, say grace, don't whistle, have nice table manners. I feel sick. But he asked me to come back in a week. It's half a victory. We must celebrate. Champagne? And caviar, of course. - Yes... - Let's join the family. What's wrong? This is one of the best restaurants in town. Of course... My sister Jakobe's fiancée, Eybert. ...especially since the girls' mother died, I couldn't... I don't understand what she sees in him. All clocks stop when he enters a room. He's a widower, and his children must appeal to her protectiveness. But I do understand what he sees in her. She's the oldest sister and therefore the one who will inherit the most. I made a point of being careful. Mr. Eybert. Hello. Peter Andreas. It's lovely to see you again. Yes, so that was really something. That's when I founded the company - - which is now one of the largest in the country - - in the field of sewerage products. Gentlemen. Ladies. We were thinking caviar and champagne, what do you think? - Yes. - Yes. What's on the menu? Trout roe and quails' eggs served on a bed of ice - - followed by wildfowl and asparagus, omelette and cheese with celery - - and for dessert, fruit. We'll take it all. - Please serve the champagne now. - Yes, sir. Per visited Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav today. He more or less authorised the project. He is a terribly officious person. "Speak clearly! Straighten your back." No, you do it much better than me. - What did he say? - No, no. Please excuse me. Still a bag of nerves? It's the last door on the right. - Hello. - Distinguished company. I almost didn't recognise you. And such classy ladies. The young man must be Ivan? Exactly. And therefore, can we please pretend we don't know each other? - Am I not classy enough? - Yes, of course. But this is important to me. It's important to my career, so if his family discovered... ...this thing about us... Please, just pretend you've never seen me before. In essence, I want to harness the forces of nature. Of course, without exploiting them ruthlessly. This applies to the hydroelectric system - - and the canal system which will connect all the corners of the country. Let me ask you a question, Mr. Sidenius. By all means. I’m curious... You're studying for an engineering degree, right? Yes. How come that a young man such as yourself, who, I’m told - - hails from several generations of clergymen - - chooses a technological path? - You don't care for my profession? - Yes. It just seems so antagonistic. - Science versus faith. - Exactly. But is that contradictory? Consider how important engineering has proved to be to humanity. I mean, how it has shortened distances between people via the railway. And the telegraph. Not to mention that we might one day have machines that fly. Consider how it can eliminate differences between people - - and thus become the final step - - towards our vision of global brotherly understanding. Isn't that an exaggeration? I’m convinced that free movement can break down prejudice - - and create a regenerated, just society - - where the individual will be able to live as a free and independent person. I wonder... I must admit to never thinking about my profession in such a magnanimous way. Would you care for some water, Miss Salomon? Thank you. - Ivan, you should hear this. - Please, Doctor, tell me. May I, Miss Salomon? I wish we'd had the chance to talk a bit sooner. Please don't misunderstand, but your wise words were so enriching. In fact, visiting this house is an altogether enriching experience. Although I cannot deny feeling a bit... ...inferior. I’m not used to the open and free habits of your family. Or rather, the way you're preoccupied with the events of the world - - as something you can learn from. That's different from my family. We began and ended the day by turning away from the world - - singing hymns and praying. Can you imagine that just being beautiful and well-dressed like you - - would be considered dishonest to God? When I think of my childhood home... ...there's always a feeling of shame. And eeriness. I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Sidenius. You haven't paid rent. - You will have your money shortly. - A gentleman is waiting in your room. - Did he give a name? - He didn't look very pleasant. And remember to pay the rent! Eberhardt? I apologise, but the caretaker said you'd be back shortly. - I've been home for a few days. - I see. Father has suddenly been taken ill. The doctor thinks it's most likely cancer. I thought you should know. We, that is all your siblings... He thought that when you learned of Father's illness - - you might feel encouraged to - - or rather feel the need to seek rapprochement. What do you mean? - Can you continue to justify... - Don't interfere in my affairs. Right! I see that I’m wasting my time trying to talk sense to you. - As you please. - There's something you should know. Although your stubbornness prevents you from accepting it - - Father is more concerned with you than with anyone else. He speaks of you every day. They've given up trying to talk you round. Instead, they're hoping that someday, life will change your mind - - so you will realise how much you owe them, and repent and reconcile. Owe? Repent? Sin? I’ve heard that before. How vulgar to use Father's illness to lure me back. You want me to subject to you because you cannot tolerate - - that I might be doing well outside of your world. I am! Tell the man who calls himself my father, that I owe him nothing! He took my childhood. That's enough! What are you staring at? You think you'll be proven right? At closer examination, I've found your project to be of no value. It's too immature. Besides, you're too young to accomplish it. You haven't yet graduated. Your name is Sidenius? Are you related to the renowned clergyman? I don't see how that's relevant? Can you tell me... ...why you changed your mind about my project? I apologise if I raised your hopes. I’m certain that by turning you down, I'm doing you a favour. A favour? Your theory of hydroelectric turbines, windmills and canals is simply... ... too naive. Too juvenile! The only possibility the project has of coming into consideration - - would be if I myself got involved. That is out of the question. Indeed. Well, that means that the case, as far as I'm concerned, is closed. Thank you for coming. That'll be all. As a former soldier, perhaps you could tell me - - precisely how humble you expect me to be, before you will endorse my project? Have you lost your mind? Please understand that this is my final refusal. And please leave! - You will regret this. - Are you threatening me? lf I had known what a pig-headed, narrow-minded old fool you are - - I would have never submitted myself to this insult. Goodbye! Where have you been? What are you eating? Sewage water? Waiter! I told you to ask uncle Delft for a loan. It's nice of you, Ivan, but it doesn't matter anymore. - What do you mean? - Bjerregrav turned down my project. He mocked my life's work. You're too young, Per. Your ideas are too extreme. You must go abroad. My father is in touch with a large engineering company in Austria - - which is involved in dam and canal projects. Professor Pfefferkorn. They would like you to come work for them. Listen to me! You need to get away from Denmark. Away from roast pork, mediocrity and Bjerregrav. Go forth into the world. Find inspiration, get a chance to show yourself and your project. Cheer up! Show them who you are. Show them that you're a fortunate man. You promised to visit us at the country house. - I know, but I can't... - Stop it. It's exactly what you need! The whole family will be there. Both my sisters will be there. Both of them! Upon my word! Mr. Sidenius. - Miss Nanny. - Oh, stop it! - Miss Jakobe. - Mr. Sidenius. Let me welcome the young genius to our holiday home. I hope the train was on time. There's just one thing, before the others join us. Please, sit down. Thank you, Ivan. The money will be transferred on the first of every month. And please keep track of all expenses. Of course. It's important that you stress to Mr. Salomon that I consider this a loan. - Against the profit from my invention. - Duly noted. Can I ask you a slightly tactless question? I have noticed that Mr. Sidenius is changing lanes - - as far as Salomon's daughters are concerned. And that Mr. Sidenius is now courting my oldest niece, Jakobe. It would be an impossible dream to court a woman with so many assets. You mean the pecuniary assets? - Excuse me? No, of course not. - Of course. Please sign for the money on the line. - Mother? - Yes? Can we please precipitate my engagement to Eybert? lf you wish. He feel great respect for Eybert. And he's from a good, Jewish family. And Father knows his financial situation. Are you sure you love him? Mr. Eybert makes me feel secure. And we have wonderful conversations. Besides, his daughters need a woman around. Do you think that your friend would agree to - - apologise to Mr. Bjerregrav? Yes. And while you're at it, ask the Tsar of Russia to step down. The responsibility of deciding the fate of such a visionary project - - shouldn't fall on such a narrow-minded technocrat as Bjerregrav. - I agree. - But surely... From an investment and societal point of view - - I’m very impressed with young Mr. Sidenius' ideas. If we could harness the forces of nature that we thought to be an enemy... But Bjerregrav needs to approve the project. He's Denmark's official technical expert. He's the only one who can recommend the project for governmental approval. Father... What if you contacted Bjerregrav? - Would that change his mind? - Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let Per travel a bit. Go to Austria to meet Professor Pfefferkorn. Then we can learn what he thinks of Per, and find out if the project is tenable. That was impolite in the middle of that passionate song. You haven't looked at me since you arrived! I’m sorry. Have you lost interest in me? Is it because you find me childish and simple-minded? Why would I do that? I have plenty of other suitors, as you well know. - I'm sure. - From better families than yours. And with much more realistic plans. Just be honest. Have you lost interest in me? Excellent. What do you want from me? Can't you just leave me alone? Since we last spoke, I’ve thought of nothing but you. Does your sense of tact not tell you to stay away from me? No. You have touched me in a way no one ever has. I need to know what you feel. You're beautiful. You're intelligent and rich, and I’m... I’m nothing. I think you're overestimating how you feel about me. I don't need to explain. My engagement to Eybert has been arranged. Now, where have the children gone to? They can stay here and play cards. Where's Nanny? She knows we're going for a ride. lf she's upset, just leave her be. Please move further along. Fine, then I’ll do it. Here you are. This makes me think of the story of the young, Swedish student from Lund. He made a bet that he could catch a stag on foot. After an hour of running, he dropped down dead. His heart exploded. Do you really believe that? I heard it as a boy, and even then I didn't believe it. - It sounds credible. - So you believe it, Mr. Sidenius? I believe that a self-respecting man will accomplish what he sets out to do. Whatever the cost. The fact of the matter is that the deer is equipped with four gallopade legs. It's not only about speed. It's about determination and stamina. So you think determination exceeds the laws of nature? I’m sorry to hear that you've lost faith in the power of determination. What's your point? Would you regain your faith in determination if you saw proof of it? In that case, I'll do it right now. Mr. Sidenius! Get back in the carriage! Stretching one's legs is good for you. Besides, think what it could do for Denmark - - if a member of Parliament regained his faith in determination. I can't let you run alongside the carriage. Then I'd better get ahead. You see, I kept my word. Was that a bet? I just felt a little dizzy. I didn't even need to run so fast. Miss Jakobe, your flowers. Your flowers. You love me, do you not? You want to be mine. You want to be mine. You love me. Isn’t it so? You love me and want to be mine. You want to be mine. Am I not right? Yes. Yes! HOCHGEBIRGSSTAUSEEN KAPRUN When the dam is completed - - we'll be able to prevent flooding further down the valley. It happens almost every year when the snow melts. And when the power station is ready, we can supply electricity to the area. It provides opportunities for everyone who lives in this part of the country. Mr. Sidenius... Guten Tag, mein lieber Freund. I hope you're doing well in Austria - - and that Professor Pfefferkorn is looking after you. We had so little time before you left. But even though the days flew by, love demanded its rights. Every moment spent with you, I treasure as one of the happiest of my life. My dear Per, it's been too long since I heard from you. Just a few words from you would make me happy. But I'm sure you're keeping busy. All day yesterday, I expected a letter from you. I was upset and went to bed at ten o'clock - - and hated you with all my heart. Until eleven o'clock. My darling, can't you forget about engineering for a while - - jump on a train and get home quickly? And kiss me. Just one kiss. That would feel wonderful. Do you know that you've never said you love me? Just once, I should like to hear what it sounds like. You can practice before we meet again. Then it will be a mutual confession. What's up with Jakobe? Did you see her at the table? Poor girl. She's jealous because she wasn't the first to get married. She's positively fuming because she's not the one - - dancing her wedding dance with Per. Tell me, my dear sister... Is that the reason for the rush? - Whatever do you mean? - You wanted to be the first. You never forgave him for rejecting you. You're bearing a grudge. You're drunk! Concentrate on dancing. You're treading on my shoes. - Are you enjoying yourself? - Yes, Mother. - Do you miss him? - Of course I do. Especially tonight. - There's something about him... - What? I don't know... There's something about the rootless part of his personality - - that we don't understand. And we haven't even met his family. Do you know if they even know about your relationship? Yes. Before he left, Per met his brother in the street - - and told him that we're engaged. It's not our place to interfere, but are you sure? - Sure of what? - That you and Per are well matched? Are you sure your relationship is not unnatural? That your social standings are not too different? That his Christian background will not clash with our Jewish faith? His uncompromising hatred for his whole family... I’ve made my choice, Mother. I love him. Yes. Fine. We just wanted to make sure that you were confident in the relationship. Hello. Where might I find senior clerk Sidenius? - First floor, fourth door on the right. - Thank you. - It shows. - Yes, a Jewish tart. Come in! Hello. My name is Jakobe Salomon. I know that your brother has told you about me. I’ve come here to try to come to a mutual understanding. Your brother, Per, my fiancée to be, has felt estranged from his family. Is this conversation your idea? Yes. Does my brother know that you're here? - No. - I see. It's only too true that ever since his childhood - - my brother has separated from his family. He systematically hardened. He's found some kind of pitiful joy in defying us. Even the ones he first and foremost owes gratitude and reverence. Even now, when our father is on his deathbed - - he won't open his darkened heart. His attempts to break free go as far as his Christian name. - You call him Per. - Yes. I won't hide my opinion. And I assume you're looking for an honest observation. Namely that this, his engagement to you - - is part of a rebellion against his home. I’m sure you know that Peter Andreas comes from a Christian family. He knows that to his parents, Christianity is the all-important power. And that they don't recognise happiness, which isn't rooted in Christian piety. And if it means anything to you, I can tell you in no uncertain terms - - that you can't expect an approval of his liaison with you. I came here with the hope of reconciliation. I see now that I was naive. And yet, I don't regret my visit. Excuse me? Is there any mail for me? Sorry, Mr. Sidenius. No mail today either. Thank you. Mr. Sidenius! There's a telegram for you. Thank you. Has something happened? It's from my brother. My father died in the night. Please accept my condolences, Mr. Sidenius. You are welcome to go home right away. No thanks. As you wish. If I can be of any help... - A lady wishes to speak to you. - That must be a misunderstanding. A foreigner. I think she arrived on the train. On the train? Good evening. How...? - Did I surprise you? - Please, come in. So you did miss me. And now I'm here. My dearest friend, Per. A thousand times my friend. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I could have sent a carriage. I didn't know whether to come. But I felt I had to visit you. I couldn't tell my parents about it. So I told them that I was visiting my old friend Rebekka in Breslau. - And you're staying? - For two days. - You must be hungry. - Yes. Uncle Delft read your father's obituary in the newspaper. I'm so sorry, Per. Has it been hard? No. I was relieved not to feel anything. Almost like an acquittal. You two could have reconciled. If you had confronted him, perhaps things had been different. You and I must be honest with each other. We must confide in one another. I have a confession to make. Please don't be upset. I went to your room in Copenhagen before I left. I missed you so much. I needed something of yours near me. And I wrote you a letter. But I never sent it. I brought it with me. My dearest Per. My dear friend. I could weep with joy at how mortified I feel - - because I have worried about you and doubted you. Not until now did I understand the kind of person you are. What you are made of, and what made you who you are. Your grandeur is also a contradiction in terms... ...which has grown from the pressure of small-mindedness and superstition. It explains your feebleness but also your immense strength. Your disdain and wilful power. Now I finally understand the importance of social justice. Due to my slowly coming to understand you and your background - - I have realised why I feel a dark and reluctant connection to the hungry - - the poor, and the people who fight for light, air, and dignity. Those people who belong to the future. Thank you. This is the life, Jakobe. A life of freedom. I still can't believe that you travelled so far just to see me. I would travel round the world three times just to have one minute with you. Maybe now's the moment to declare it. Yes. Declare what? l... - I... - l... -...love you. -...love you. Oh no! I hadn't noticed it. - What's it doing here? Let's move. - No. We have our backs to it. Just enjoy the beautiful view. - Do you hear that? - What? Can't you hear them? The church bells. They won't leave us alone anywhere! It's as if they're following me! Per... - See how he flaunts his impudence. - Per! Look at his abject humility and how he exposes his misery. - I hate it! - Stop it, Per. When has anyone ever spat their disgust in your face? Stop it! Stop it now. Per! What's got into you! Stop it now! Stop it! Stop it, Per. Stop it! Look at me. Stop it! Stop it now. Look at me. Sometimes I feel like the hill troll - - who crawled out of his hole to be with humans. He discovered that the light was too bright. The sun's rays were too bright - - so he went back into the hole and cowered in fear. Back to the darkness. Go to sleep. It's been a long day for both of us. Well, Mr. Sidenius. Are you happy to be here? Very happy. In the past few months, I've learned more than at college in Denmark. Good to hear. I’ve been studying your project. Some details are disputable. Especially the fascine revetment and the retaining walls. And also in the draft for the fiord regulations regarding the lateral works. Of course, Professor. But as a whole, Mr. Sidenius... ...I’m very impressed. You possess an unusually fresh and graphic understanding of - - the forces of nature and how to harness them. Thank you, Professor. lf you knew what that means to me. I sincerely hope that the Danish nation appreciates your enormous talent. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. My dear friends and honoured guests. Today is a very special and moving day for me and my wife. He are pleased to announce the engagement - - of our oldest daughter Jakobe to Per Sidenius. On a day like today, I feel like making a short speech to the couple - - who have now said their first official "I do". Let me start with you, Per, my future son-in-law. You're probably the most stubborn person I’ve ever met. For better or for worse. Mostly for better. When I think about how persistently you fought to make Jakobe yours - - and how unyielding you have been in fighting for your national project. You went to Austria to study under Professor Pfefferkorn. He unequivocally gave his seal of approval to Per's ideas. Isn’t that something? And I’m happy to inform you that we have formed a consortium - - of affluent people who want to support your project, Per. Seen from a financial point of view, it looks as if - - the project is capable of being realised. You're fortunate man. I think the future lies at your feet. Good afternoon, or rather, good evening. That unpleasant man was here again. He left you a letter. - I can only offer you water. - No thank you. How long has Mother been in Copenhagen? When your father died, I had to leave the rectory. I had nowhere else to go, so I wanted to be near Eberhardt. You look very elegant. And you've acquired fine manners. Your brother tells me that you've found a wealthy family - - who pays for your lifestyle. Eberhardt and I agreed to spare your father the distress he would have felt - - at learning of your relationship with the Jewish daughter of a rich man. A fortunate man, they call you. What manner is that? What did Mother wish to speak to me about? You didn't attend your father's funeral. But until his last breath, he hoped you would return to the grace of humility. He wanted me to give this to you after his death. That's why I asked Eberhardt to look you up. The watch was special to your father. And let me tell you, Peter Andreas - - why he insisted to his last breath that I give it to you. As a young boy, your father was going away to grammar school. His father demanded to have the key to his suitcase - - so he could check what he was bringing. Your father felt very offended, so he left without saying goodbye. When he arrived at the school in the evening, he opened the suitcase... ...and found the watch you're holding. He realised that it was a gift. It was meant to be a surprise. Your father cried violently. And in repentance, he walked throughout the night - - all the way home, flung his arms around his father's neck - - and asked for forgiveness. It was on that night, when he humiliated himself... ...that he found the path back to the light. And to peace of mind. And to Our Lord in Heaven. Never forget what your father said. Exiled be he who defies The Lord! I think I'd like that glass of water now. There's a kitchenette out there. - And you're quite sure? - Yes. You're pregnant. - When will you be finished with that? - Two minutes. With love from Jakobe. She hopes the meeting goes well. I’ve been waiting for this since I was a boy. How many of your father's friends will attend? Seven or eight. - What on earth is that? - It was delivered yesterday. I had it made in Vienna. Does it look like me? To a T. People are completely unaware that in a few hours, we will make history. We are laying the foundation for the new national works. - It's big. - It's a quarter to ten! Hurry up! In order to connect all corners of Denmark - - and make the regions part of modern society - - we must break away from the notion of the blessings of pork and butter - - and instead make the peasant society part of the whole nation. And as I said by way of introduction, my canal project - - combined with hydropower and windmills is crucial. I promise that your investments will not be wasted. When Denmark becomes self-sufficient, money will flow in. Thank you for taking the time to listen to the plans for Denmark's new works. This consortium, which is made up of private, independent investors - - has done some calculations, and we have reached the conclusion that - - the project is financially feasible. This, of course, is subject to ministerial permission. We know that Mr. Sidenius has been in touch with a high-ranking official - - and that the meeting for personal reasons - - concluded in an unfortunate way. We have been in touch with this person. And when, in a moment, he enters through that door - - we ask that you give him the unreserved apology he's expecting. Please, Isak. Gentlemen... Do you seriously think that I owe him an apology? But what for? What for? You must understand that I cannot accept any kind of tutelage. I drew up my project without any form of supervision or intervention. I cannot allow it to happen now. Presumably you know, that without Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav's approval - - the project is not feasible. I want to make it clear that the Engineer Colonel insulted me. He mocked my project! So he should apologise to me. Are you refusing to apologise? Yes. I resent having to apologise to an old, power-crazed tyrant. A legalist who lacks vision! I'm sorry. Is that your final decision? Absolutely. Well, that concludes matters for today, gentlemen. The consortium is hereby disbanded. I assume that none of you have any regrets - - about the outcome of this meeting. Imagine having to apologise to that power-crazed, uncompromising person. - Who was being uncompromising, Per? - You too? Would a small apology matter that much if it could save your project? Yes, in my world. I’m astonished by your attitude. You always say that the end justifies the means. This confirmed the rotten connection between money and those in power. And that's apparently something you support. What do you mean? lf I’m to follow your rule of conduct... ...then this is the last time we talk. - What are you saying? You're prerequisite by birth to value these traits which I seem to lack. I didn't hear that. The outcome of today's meeting - - was very disappointing to my colleagues and me. I refuse to be bullied by that tyrant. Especially on such an important project. In future, please remember the position you hold - - within my family, and conduct yourself with the necessary elegance. And with dignity. Am I being clear? Yes, sir. Jakobe? - Did you hear? - Hear what? Come and sit next to me. Is your mother's name Kristine Margrethe? Yes. Why do you ask? She died. - What do you mean? - I read the obituary in the newspaper. I noticed that she was a clergyman's widow. "Our dear mother, Kristine Margrethe Sidenius - - has found eternal peace." It's signed "her children." - Did you know she was on her deathbed? - I knew she was sickly. But I didn't know it was that serious. To think what a life she led. With so many children and such a difficult husband. And in poverty. And yet, she never complained. I remember you telling me she once said: "Don't pity me. Pity my husband and my children." That which is gone, is gone. Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about you. Let's go travelling. Soon. To England. Just you and me. Let's call it an engagement trip. There, we can live only for our love. And comfortably plan our wedding. I have big news myself, which I look forward to telling you. Go with me to the country house. Don't be alone tonight. The guest room is ready for you. We should both tell Mother and Father of your mother's death. - We owe them that. - Now that we're almost related. I owe them nothing, apart from the money, of course. That's not what I meant. They've never mentioned the money. It's something I’ve thought about. I want to be rid of my debt and become independent. Not from you, but from your family's money. lf the money's not a problem to them, it shouldn't be to you. No, but I don't want to be indebted to your family. Hello. I’m here to see senior clerk Sidenius. First floor, fourth door on the right. Thank you. Come in! I saw in the paper that Mother died. Yes. I thought you were abroad. How did she die? Signe went to her room in the morning to comb her hair. Mother was quite impatient and asked Signe to hurry up. Then Mother closed her eyes and passed away peacefully. She wrote a farewell letter to each of us siblings. There's one for you as well. Along with a parcel. She will, of course, be buried next to Father in Jutland. Her body will be transported there by ship tomorrow afternoon. Prior to the funeral, we're convening for a family ceremony by the coffin. Now that we know you're in town, we'd be sorry if you missed it. For several reasons, it's probably best that I stay away. I'm sure my fiancée would like to attend - - but she would probably be out of place. - Nor would she be welcome. - You're right. Peter Andreas? Due to official duties - - I'm prevented from accompanying Mother on her final journey. I was hoping you'd be able to ignore your own obstinacy this once - - and pay Mother your last respects by accompanying the coffin across the sea. I think you know my answer. For my son, Peter Andreas, in the blessed name of Our Lord Jesus Christ. I write to you, my son, in order to try one last time before I close my eyes - - to speak to your heart. I know you don't follow the ways of God. But it's my sincere hope - - that you will show your fellow men humility and selfless love. May I have a pen and some paper, please? From earth to earth... ...ashes to ashes... ...dust to dust. - What a nice surprise. - I needed a bit of fresh air. After my mother's funeral, I needed some breathing space. I couldn't think of anywhere more beautiful than this area. - How long will you be staying? - A couple of days, before I go back. Duty calls. I just came here to thank the reverend for his words at the funeral. Not at all. Your mother was an unusually modest and conscientious person - - to God and her next of kin. That's how one remembers her. I cannot claim to have known your parents. I met them a few times. We were almost neighbours. Reverend Sidenius' and my understanding - - of the function of the Church were very different. But I respect him. He was an officious man. How does it feel to be back? I’ve come with mixed emotions. I almost fled the area. But seeing these surroundings again has made an impression. It's overwhelming. One can gather much wisdom from nature. We read in the newspaper about your engagement in Copenhagen. - Sidenius is not a common name. - I see. I believe your future father-in-law is a very wealthy and influential man? You're marrying into money. Nice way to escape your duty to support your wife. Father! At no point has money come into it. Besides, as an engineer I will make enough money to support a family. This wedding, and I ask from a purely professional point of view... A Jewish woman and the son of a clergyman, how do you...? You're overstepping your mark. Stop questioning our visitor. Would you like to try our home-made cake? Inger made it. Don't be shy. There's no need to be modest. Help yourself. Well... Thank you. Jakobe, do you know when Per will return from Jutland? He sent a short telegram, and then he was gone. So you have no idea when we'll be seeing him again? After the funeral, I assume. We need to discuss certain principles and financial issues before the wedding. Of course, Father. You have no idea how much I enjoy having left the city. I assure you that life there can be complicated. Whereas here... Have you ever been to Copenhagen? No, never, but I should like to experience a big city. And see all those classy people that you know. Let me take your gloves. I have no doubt that your fiancée is not only rich, but also beautiful. I’m sorry, I seem to have startled you. - Have you come back? - I had some errands. And... I found your gloves in my pocket. - Here you are. - Thank you. I’ve looked for them everywhere. Would you like to go for a stroll? Yes. ...and the lock will ensure the correct depth of water... ...so that sea-going ships can pass... - You're bored. - Not at all. - You seem so serious all of a sudden. - I do? Hopefully, you're not missing your fiancée too much? No, not at all. It's because I'm back here. Away from it all. I almost feel homesick. A feeling of happiness. - Are you not happy in Copenhagen? - Yes. Everything that I've worked hard for... And I've worked very hard. It has become my misfortune. Well... I'd better get back. Can't sleep? Good morning, Reverend. Unfortunately not. - Is it body or soul? - My soul. - Shut out or shut in? - Both, I fear. Come, Mr. Sidenius. Let's walk. Tell me. More than anything, I feel trapped. I can't sleep because I have so many thoughts. I’m confused. I'm tense. Is this a test? Is this a punishment? The punishment for my life. Is it God's judgement of my life? Is that why I feel so restless? Or is it homesickness? Or is it my father's curse that makes me so unsettled? Mr. Sidenius... Don't ruin yourself with destructive thoughts. You're your own enemy and gaoler. Step outside your prison. Don't be afraid. God is with you. Please, bless me! Forgive me for forsaking Mother and Father! And for forsaking Ivan. And Jakobe. I don't want to do harm anymore. - Not like this. Stand up. - I deserve the punishment. Humility is Heaven's price for providing peace of the soul. You have taken the first step on the path to awareness and humility. Stay here for a while when I leave. Cry if you feel like it. I shall leave you now. Mr. Sidenius, is that you? Father and Mother are on a visit, but they'll be back shortly. Would you like a cup of coffee? You're engaged to be married. Don't you understand? You want to be mine. It's lovely that you're back from Jutland. I missed you so much. I tried to persuade Mother and Father to return early from the country house. I wanted to be here when you came back. But you know how Father enjoys spending time away from the city. - Will you go there with me tonight? - Yes. This is where my bridal dress is being made. And that's all I'm telling. It will be simple and elegant. I picked up the tickets to England. First, we'll take the train to Esbjerg and then get on the boat to Harwich. And then it'll be just me and you. Our engagement trip. I can't wait. Aren't you excited about my big news? You look so serious. Are you still thinking about your mother's funeral? Yes, of course, but Jakobe... We need to talk. If it's about the wedding, Father wants you to get in touch as soon as possible. He wants to meet with you and the solicitor. Thank you. No, it's more serious than that. Jakobe... You're the most perfect person I’ve ever met. You've meant so much to me. No one has meant more to me. But we're facing a huge decision. Lately, I've been thinking... I’ve been thinking whether... Whether we belong together. And whether we've ever belonged together. Perhaps the whole thing was just a notion on my part. - On your part? - Yes. Yes. Maybe it was all a mistake, because I insisted too hard. And lately, I've been thinking that perhaps we're too different. And that perhaps we'd never be truly happy together. In the long run. You don't think we could? I have my doubts. So it's probably for the best - - that we end it now, before any harm has come to anyone. So you break off the engagement? I’m very sorry, Jakobe. How can you speak of... How can you speak of our relationship as something which only existed - - because you wanted it to? As if I never loved you? Don't you understand that I almost perished with love - - and longing for you? Perhaps you don't understand what it means to love another person. Maybe you only know the unfavourable side of passion. Self-absorption and conceitedness. You see, we're too different. Right? Why don't you just come out with it? I beseech you, at least be honest. Is there someone else? You're just pointing out that we're too different. Tell me the truth! I would respect you if you'd just be honest this one time. Just admit that you're in love with someone else! I guess that's the Sidenius family's trait. That your inner, stunted emotions need to be so solemn. Good Lord! They only cover up your vanity. Your immaturity. I understand that you're angry, Jakobe. I really do understand. And I'm sorry it had to end this way. I really am. At least I won't have to take your barbaric name. Please tell your father that I intend to repay every penny - - of the money he lent me. With compound interest. Anna? Please have these delivered to Mr. Sidenius. Yes, Miss Salomon. Please insert this advertisement in the Berlingske Gazette. "Philip Salomon and his wife regret to announce - - that the engagement of their daughter Jakobe - - to Mr. Sidenius has been called off." - Is this a joke? - No, unfortunately not. Why wasn't I told? He were never particularly taken by this... What about his project? Our investment! He signed a contract which clearly outlined the conditions of repayment. As security for the loan, I'd give you the patent for my invention. I'd appreciate it if the money was paid out as soon as possible. I don't know the value of your machines. My decision is influenced by the fact that I’ve recently learned - - that your engagement to Miss Salomon has been called off. That's why I suggested... On principle, we as a business never get involved in anything - - if we can't get a bank security. So unfortunately, Mr. Sidenius, we're unable to grant you a loan. Mother? Yes, child. Remember, I talked about visiting my friend Rebekka in Breslau? - Yes. - I think I’d like to do that now. But I don't have enough money for the journey. Will you ask Father for help? - When will you be leaving? - As soon as possible. Perhaps tomorrow. So that's why it's been so hard to reach you. Has it? I apologise. Does anyone know? Not even your sister or Ivan? Only Rebekka knows. She knows a good doctor. Don't trouble Father with this. I’ll get you the money for everything. And make sure to rest afterwards. lf anyone asks, we'll say you needed to get away, after Per broke it off. How do you expect to carry out the project now? Without Salomon? Without the banking sector and the manufacturing sector's man? And what about Bjerregrav? You're mad. - How about a small loan? - And what would you need that for? I owe Salomon money, and I'm getting married in Jutland. I won't lend you any money. When I heard you were no longer Philip Salomon's son-in-law - - it made no sense to me. How can an ambitious young man like you renounce such an opportunity? It still doesn't make sense to me. Jakobe? Jakobe? First, I'd like to make the apology I owe you. I apologise, sir. You see, I currently find myself in straitened circumstances. I ask for your kind understanding. I was hoping you might once again consider my project - - under your skilful supervision - - in order to introduce it to affluent investors - - who might advance me the money. I’m afraid it's too late, Mr. Sidenius. Thank you for coming. You may remember me from the time when I was poor. How times do change. You see, I'm getting married to a wealthy baroness from Jutland. Since I'm leaving the city, I might as well get rid of these things. You will notice that the suits are made from the finest Italian wool. I’ll give you three kroner. The bust is part of the bargain. It's made by one of Germany's finest... I can't sell it. And the books are in German. Nobody buys German books. - But... You can have the drawings too. - I can't sell used paper. No... And the way to God is the way of trial. I have no idea what you're babbling about. Three kroner. Do you know who I am? No you don't, but let me enlighten you. A son of God. Agenius! All that are bred and born in darkness will one day appear - - and sentence shall be passed upon them. Keep your money! But beware! Beware His intrepid curse! Young Mr. Sidenius? It's been a long time. Is there anything I can do for you? Would you ask Jakobe to come down here? She's gone out of town, and will be away for some time. Look at the state of you! Do you remember our first conversation? Fortune favours fools, and success is the father of regret. Well... Pride goes before a fall. There you go. That looks fine. Hagbart? Stand still. Straighten your back. That looks fine. Nails! The other hand. - And keep your back straight! - Lift your arms. Receive the Apostolic blessing. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ - - and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen. - Hello, Jakobe. - Eybert. It's been a long time. Indeed. - You've been out of town. - We've opened an office in Germany. So the girls are now fluent in German. They send their love. Give them my love. I apologise if I’m imposing on you... But I want you to know that I've put all the disappointments behind me. Time heals all wounds, as they say. All is forgiven. I want to ask you, now that everything's changed - - if you'd like to, when it's convenient for you, of course - - let me take you to the tearoom? Or to dinner. You and me. Dear Eybert. You've always been so good and considerate to me. Can we try again, Jakobe? I'm sure you would have been the most loving husband to me. But we would never be happy. You see, I don't love you. Damn, another disruption! First of all, Per, how is your project for the future going? I’m just finishing up a project for the new port of Esbjerg. It will be the centre, or rather the junction, for European shipping traffic. - There'll be docks, shipyards and... - And how will you accomplish that? Well, the authorities are neither to be led nor driven... I understand. And when you're not working on your vision for the future? As you know, I’m helping out around the house. Other than that, I spend time contemplating. The fact of the matter is, Per - - that a small home like yours and Inger's with three children - - involves expenses, right? Your bills are not being paid. I'm mentioning it because I can't keep supporting you on my modest wages. I’m here to work out a solution. It's obvious that you're having money problems. I insist on not having any tutelage. I strongly ask you not to speak to me in that manner. I’m here to work out a solution to your family responsibilities. Listen, Per. Yesterday, I met the young, rich landowner, Mr. Brück. He's heard of your engineering skills. He needs some water regulation for the streams on his estate this spring. I suggested he contact you. - W... w... welcome, Mr. Sidenius. - Thank you. My wife Inger. I believe you two already know each other. Yes, s... s... since childhood. - Welcome, Inger. - Thank you. It's nice to be back here. - Shall we walk? - Yes. If you'll help carry this. A simple drainage system must be - - a m... m... mere trifle for an engineer such as yourself. On the contrary. I’m happy to help out. D... d... do you see possibilities, Mr. Sidenius? Yes, absolutely. With a few changes to the bed of the stream - - we can lower the ground-water level, so the soil can be used as arable land. It requires some powerful pumps by the barrage. They could be driven by mills. One per pumping station. I’d forgotten that the meadow extends all the way to the lake. Would you mind if I brought the children here, Mr. Brück? No, of... of course. They can s... s... swim and f... fish as much as they like. The rowing boats are there for that purpose. Have you been here all day? Are you cold? I like your braids. Did you do them yourself? - Can I help? - Yes, you can give the children bread. - Excuse me, who are you? - I was just passing by. - My name is Jakobe Salomon. - Do you know where you are? This is the YWCA. I'm sure you understand why we can't have people of your faith here. - My faith? - The YWCA is a Christian movement. I understand. I’m sorry. This is what makes it turn with the wind. When the wind hits it, the sails rotate like this. That creates electricity, which creates a current. Do you understand? Right there. No! You broke it! Get down! Don't be so clumsy! And apologise to Father. Apologise to Father! Apologise to Father, Hagbart. Hagbart! You come back and apologise to Father! - Are the children asleep? - Ingeborg and Lise are fast asleep. Hagbart complains of a stomach ache. I’m sure he'll go to sleep soon. Please, will you not speak so harshly to him? He's a sensitive boy. Sure. He's a clever little boy who misses his father. - Are you coming to bed? - When I've read the paper. - Goodnight, dear. - Goodnight. I know I've disappointed you by not getting married and having children. Instead, in accordance with our family tradition, I want to help the needy. So I've decided to found a charity school here in Copenhagen. I know it will cost me my whole inheritance. But since I have no one to leave it to - - I can't think of a more meaningful way of spending it. - Miss Salomon, we're ready. - Gather round, children! Come here. You need to face this way. And move that way a little. I think we're ready. - Look at that handsome gentleman. - Look into the box. And stand completely still. One, two, three... Thank you! Our children hardly ever see their parents. They work all day. Normal schools are so wretched, they seem more like penal institutions. Children in need are brutalised by police who send them to the poorhouse. And the one person who could teach them wisdom - - the vicar, speaks only of doomsday and hell. So how will these children ever learn to love their neighbours - - and become decent human beings? Little by little, I want to turn the school into an alternative school. A place of refuge, a sanctuary. I have personally observed how a bad childhood can scar a person. I wanted to create a place, which can help break the social inheritance. Come in, Hagbart. Mother told me to say goodnight to you. Yes. Come in. I made this because I broke the other mill. Thank you. You're not afraid of Father, are you? You and I will work it out. Do you want me to leave? Why do you ask? You seem as if you'd rather be on your own. I know you're having a hard time. Can't you speak to my father? Maybe he can help you find solace in God. Wherever I’ve searched for Him, I've only found myself. God is superfluous to he who has found himself. What's wrong, Per? There are people who are drawn to disaster. People who can only find emancipation in hopelessness and solitude. What are you saying? I sometimes think it would be better for you and the children if I weren't here. You must promise me not to be dragged down with me. - There's the birthday boy! - You look very dapper. - Happy birthday, Hagbart. - Bow and say thank you, Hagbart. - Hello, Mr. Brück. - Hello. - H... h... happy birthday, Hagbart. - Bow and say thank you. - Thank you for in... in... inviting me. - We're glad you could make it. Come in. - Here comes the birthday cake! - Happy birthday, Hagbart. Can you help yourself? Maybe Brück can help you. I’ve launched the boat. Perhaps you'd like to come and try it out, Hagbart? It'll make for a nice afternoon. - A large piece for you. - Pass along the plates. Here's to a happy birthday. And thank you all for coming. Happy birthday, Hagbart. He must have been a good boy all year to get such a sunny day. His behaviour has been exemplary. I need to leave. I forgot to tell the people at the lock something. Do you have to do that right now? It's Hagbart's birthday. I’ll be back soon. Are you satisfied now? JAKOBE SALOMON HAS OPENED CHARITY SCHOOL IN COPENHAGEN. Miss Salomon? - I have a letter for you. - Thank you. You came after all. It's been such a long time. So this is how you live. Here, in the wilderness. I’ve felt alienated - - and rootless all my life. But out here, I've finally become conscious of who I am. In my ungodly solitude. Without it, I would merely have been half a human being. A Sidenius always. So now I feel liberated. I’ve followed you from a distance. I knew you were ill, but not that it was this serious. It's cancer. The doctor says I don't have long to live. Would you like a cup of coffee? Tell me about Copenhagen. We speak of you often. Despite the racket back then, Father and Ivan agree that you did the right thing. One day, I’m sure the world will realise the grandeur - - and necessity in your national works. That's something I wanted to ask you... Will you display my project and my model at your school? As a kind of inspiration to the children. Yes, of course. Of course that's where it should be. The real reason I wrote and asked you to come... I wanted to give you this. It's my last will. Your school is the sole beneficiary. It's 12,600 kroner. It's not a lot, but it's what I've been able to save up through the years. And I wanted to ask... ...if you find yourself able to receive this gift. Why shouldn't I? Even though you and I are very different... ...I'm not sure I ever really understood you. But that makes me even more grateful for this gift. Did I hurt you deeply? I wouldn't change a thing about my life. On the contrary, I feel very happy to have known you. Only with the joy and sorrow which you caused, did my life gain meaning. The school which I’ve created, is as much your work as it is mine. In a way, they all turned out to be our children. Thank you.
