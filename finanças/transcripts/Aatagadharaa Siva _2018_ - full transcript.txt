[moped running] [cow mooing] Place ten rupees there. Put the rest in your pocket. You've taken ten rupees at the time she was born. Are you still charging ten rupees only? She has grown up but not your fee Jangayya. How will you earn a better living this way? Lord Siva knows what I want. I just hope her wound is healed soon. [moped arriving] That's okay. Why don't you consult a doctor in town about your leg? -It's him. -Oh him? You got a letter from the government. Grandpa, I brought him here. [laughs] Wait then. Take this. Off you go. Don't you have anything for me Jangayya? Palm jaggery. Jaggery? You guys aren't satisfied with the government salary eh? What do I do with jaggery? [moped leaving] This is written by the Superintendent of Prisons. To serve as the hangman, The date on which you have to come to execute the hanging... -You got a call again? -Yes You save the lives of animals but take human lives. What joy is this? When the cattle are threatened by wolves one should always do what justice says. This is a joy of it's kind. -Go now. -Weird man. [clock chimes] [chewing metal sound] Hey, why are you still awake? Go to sleep. [groaning] Hey, what's wrong? Wait I am coming. [unlocking the keys] [coughs] Babji, what happened? Get up?? Hey, what are you doing? Let go! [strangling] Srinu?? [strangling] [slits] [groans] [metal door creaking] [metal door creaking] [taps] Hey, Mallesh. Venkat must've gone to take a leak. The milk van is here. Open the gate. [gate opens] [vehicle arriving] [siren] Hey, stop the vehicle. Go back. Stop. -Gopal Rao?? -Sir. -Check that guy. -Okay sir. [siren]Victor calling. Victor calling Sir, this guy looks dead drunk. Don't you know how to use your stick? Hey! Wake up! [kicks] Sir, this guy is dead. Looks like a beggar. Sir do you think someone killed him? Why would someone kill him simply? Hunger should be blamed for this murder, sir. There should come a day when we arrest hunger. Enough of your worthless poetry. Drag him into the jeep! Okay, sir. Hey, lift him up. Okay, hold him there. [door closes] Hmm?? get going. Hey, drive towards the cotton mill. -That's not our division, sir. -Don't teach me. Drive. [siren] Hey. Stop here. [vehicle halts] -Hey. -Sir. -Dump the body carefully over there. -Okay, sir. -Do you get sir's calculation now? -No. This case earns us nothing. Are all the cases, court drama?? ...adjournments, dead body stench and sleepless nights needed? -Get down, guys. -Ok, sir. [thud] [vehicle leaving] Red alert! Red alert! A prisoner sentenced to death had escaped from the Central Jail. Over! [siren] Sir, this dead body is being juggled between you and two town's SI. Both of you seem to be evading it. There are a lot of people ready to get into empty blankets. Victor calling.... Victor calling... Garuda responding... Over! Move it. Go. [music] [panting] A prisoner who was to to be hanged in 4 days is on the run. Babji had severely injured a guard on his way out. Anita, Basha is LIVE. Reports suggest a prisoner and a barber have been interviewed. Here are the visuals exclusively for our audience. He is a weird man. He wouldn't talk to anyone in the initial days. His silence scared me even when it was me who had the knife. He would escape. Why wouldn't he? The jail's Vaastu itself is faulty. His room is facing North-West which is air. The jail's wall is facing South-East which is fire. Can fire contain the wind? Babji?? The crime world is terrified of this name. He is an epitome of grievous atrocity. Frightening mankind with his series of murders Babji was declared a demon in the society Thus, being sentenced to death by the court. Babji was a mystery to the police despite all his crimes. But in the rage that he didn't marry his daughter to him he killed his uncle and was nabbed by the cops. Only after this were all his serial killings exposed. "Is this really a space of freedom?" "O' crazy mad one" "World is a prison in itself" "It answers you, it teases you" "It restricts you with love" "It touches you, it chases you" "It kills you with a smile" "Watch the news" "It's spreading the pictures" "Watch the news" "It's selling it for money" Special announcement?? Prisoner on a death sentence, Gajulamarri Babji is on the run. He is 6 feet tall, has a dusky complexion. Aged 25 years. The reward for catching him is a million. Do our guys assume people would go crazily behind him for a million? That's true actually. People turn desperate when the fuel prices drop. Why wouldn't they leave a million? Wouldn't they hunt him down? "You'd shiver at the sight of your own shadows following you" "You'd run with the fear of life" "You chase yourself like a thief" "You try and hide from yourself" "This game and chase is never ending... Oh dangerous man!" If such people escape, how can a woman like me feel safe? I fear to step out of the house as some rogue might outrage my modesty. No matter what, Babji must be taken into custody and hanged. Or else, I want Mr. Narendra Modi to resign. Did I say it the way you want? "You are a stranger to yourself" "Who can identify you by your height and weight?" "They can never make out it's you" "Your beard and moustache can't hide your true identity" "Truth can't be altered with a disguise" "Your true self is yet to be discovered... Oh dangerous man!" [music] "Watch the news" "It's spreading the pictures" "Watch the news" "It's selling it for money" [birds chirping] [music] [crow caws] [vehicle starts] [spanner creaking] Nah... My queen doesn't like you. That is why it screwed us up. I'm fighting since an hour?? You remind me of my childhood love. She also had blushing cheeks, frizzy hair and oily face. [chuckles] [vehicle honks] Looks like someone's coming. Boss, a small favor?? The irony here is I am in trouble myself. I myself am looking for help. Tell me what it is. Have you seen a short guy and a fair girl come this way? Who are you looking for first? The guy first?? What's wrong with you, guys? Why are you behind guys instead of following girls? Tell me if you're straight or not? Hey! Just tell us if you saw them. A few crows, dogs and you two are the only things I saw on this road. I can see that. You're a mad dog. He's a hairy one. Get lost, you rabid dog! -Mind your business. -Hey! Careful?? Stop! Stop sir! I am begging you, sir. Please stop! Sir please stop. I am begging you, sir Thank god! He stopped. Sir! What is it? My sweetheart?? My darling is upset, sir. She disagrees to cooperate. What can an oldie like me do to get your darling to cooperate? By darling, I mean my vehicle, sir. -Can you be of any help? -Oh, is it? You've appeared like god at the right time. It's not God who is right on time. It's the lord Yama. Why are you hesitant? It's not a hangman's noose. [vehicle moves] I've got to travel 10 kilometers to get the vehicle parts. It's gonna take some time. What can I do if it's fate that my darling should spend the night with you? Okay, you carry on. -I will shift the material into the jeep. -All right. You wait, I am coming. -Sir -Yes? Thanks for your rope and time, sir. I need you to do me another favor, sir. What is that? That guy has nowhere to go. Drop him on your way, sir. I don't know who he is or where he has to go. How can we drop him where he wants to go? Drop him the minute you are irritated. I feel irritated seeing him already. [engine purring] What's your name? Where are you from? You have no name or native. Can't you speak too huh? [vehicle approaching] [gasps] Hey, Jangayya... -Seems like you are back to work? -Yeah. Why don't you find killing contracts on your own? One right contract will help you settle down. I am helpless. I am bound to get such worthless rogues to court. Are investigation and FIR necessary? Why not shoot them to death? God gave us the duty of safeguarding Law and Order. Never speak degrading it. You are making good use of the Law and Order. I neither get into a business without profit nor pay for prostitution. I know that. Anyways, I always find you alone. Who is he? [phone ringing] Sir... tell me, sir. I am going to court. I'll be back once I am done there. Okay, sir. Move it. [vehicle starts] [vehicle starts] [music] [gunshot] [groans] [dragging] [gasping] Water... give me water... [gasping] Water. [bonnet closes] [vehicle starts] [vehicle halts] Could you do me a small favor? Yes. I dropped my ring along with that piece of paper. Could you get it for me? [cloth tears] Wait wait... NOTICE: WANTED [gasps] [hawk squealing] [metal squealing] -Found it? -I would find it indeed. But they can't catch me. Hey! Wait man! Hey! Stop there! [gasps] [vehicle starts] [vehicle approaching] 'A sober man is a great soul.' 'But, an alcoholic is our God.' Hello. Lift please! -This is no Government ride. -Sir, it's nearby. Quite close... Eh? Oh! It's elexir dude! [chuckles] Hey! Let go man! What is this? O' God! Paying heed to our shrill cry in the desert... You are our savior who've come to quench our thirst. Oh, God! Tell me what I can help you with. I've been waiting for a bus since an hour. Not a single bus passed by. My house is nearby. If you drop me, I'll give you a gift. -Who's there? -Order, your Majesty! Go get the ride. -What about the bottle? -I shall get it. Hey! -Let's go. -Thank you. Let's go together my dear king! [music] Oh no! Oh Adi! Are you hurt? Oh no! There's blood too. Do you expect buttermilk to ooze out in the place of blood in case of an injury? Anyway I don't fear this wound or your dad. Come on?? I can't do it anymore. I am tired. Shall I get you sapota juice? We aren't jogging to drop a few pounds. It's a chase. We'll be caught if we are tired. We will be dead if we are caught. -I somehow feel scared. -You think I feel like making out? I am scared too. Shame on you! I didn't know you were such a coward. It's not cowardice Paru. I have to be romancing you, not get violent. I see a temple over there. Let's go. -Let's go -Why go to the temple? Do you have to tie the holy thread amidst the tension? To hell with your doubts! Even a questionnaire won't have so many doubts in it. No one would stop even if we dance staying here. If we go closer to the temple, someone might give us a lift. Let's go. [vehicle halts] [chanting prayers] You are making me play your game. You are making me take your burden. Make sure I face no troubles lord! There's no devotion. But, you want the offering. It's a holy offering to you and a feast to me. Whatever, it is the almighty's offering. [music] [bumps] -Damn! Why don't you drive carefully? -Eh? Please drive carefully, sir. Hey, who the hell are you? [tyres screeching] -Hey, who the hell are you? Get down! -Sir please don't do it. -Get down you! -Please give us a lift to next village sir. We don't want to travel for free. Consider it as two tickets. We will pay you. Get down, you rascal! -Me? A rascal? -Yes! Do you think I am shameless to stay after what you said? Do you think I am senseless and numb? I am all of those for real, sir. Please drop us. By the way, I am not a rascal. I am a gentleman. Who says that? You face looks cunning. What's in the face, sir? I'd wear a mask it if you hate it. But, please don't ask us to get down here. We've been roaming around in the sun since 2 days. My Paru who was like a delicate jasmine is looking a jungle cat now. We'd begin to look like you if we stay any longer. Hey! Who is the girl by the way? -She's my lover, sir. We eloped from home. -Hey! You eloped with a girl. What kind of a gentleman are you? Hey girl! What's your name? I am Adi and she is Paru, sir. Where are you from girl? What's your father's name? [sobs] Oh no! He made my sweetheart cry. Would you hurt your daughter the same way? I'd break her legs if it were my daughter. -What if it was your son? -I'd hack him to death. Aah! Are you a father or a factionist? It's okay, grandpa. Consider me your grandson and pardon me. You might look violent but you are kind at heart. I know. J-A-N-G-A-Y-Y-A. Grandpa's name must be Jangayya. Grandpa, we'd name our second child after you. -Hey, shut up. -Hush! He looks like the guard of Jurrasic Park. By the way, people grow beard on their face, why did her grow his face over a beard? Hey! You talk too much. What's your zodiac sign man? My grandpa always said the same thing. [chuckles] Hey, shut up! [vehicle starts] Hush! Do you have a phone boy? Yeah I've got a TV too! Come on, sir. Why would thieves give away visiting cards? Brother, would you carry a phone while eloping? Oh, I asked the monkey king! You don't even know our signals are tracked. Jangayya grandpa! Will you make me a promise? I am all yours, Paru. A promise is nothing. Ask me what it is. I've left my family behind for you. I've left all my neighbors for you. So what? Would you love me so much that I don't miss them? Paru, I will make sure you don't miss your family in the day. Will you make sure I don't miss mine at night? Then, we could together have fun day and night. You should apologize first whenever we fight. Isn't that what happens always? You get married to us with love. That turns out to be a hangman's noose for us. Ain't it brother? -Sir, are you from the military? -Yes, bro. -Is it? -I'm coming from Rajasthan border. My wife is going to deliver in a week. That is why I am going home. We have ordered liquor in Goa. Foreign whiskey. But it would be delivered in 3 days. Sir you look handsome like a full bottle liquor. You shall have a son like a quarter bottle, sir. Thank you, brother. Are you going to the town? No, sir. A girl from our caste eloped with a guy who belongs to the caste of the guy in the backseat. We have to catch them before they start a family of their own. That is our aim. -So, are you boths friends? -Hell, no! We differ in caste, stature and revenge. -We are both enemies. -Yes. But, you are roaming together? Liquor has turned our enmity into friendship, sir. So, alcohol brought you two together. And what will you do once you find them? I'll chop the guy who eloped with our girl into pieces. I'll sacrifice the girl who trapped our guy to our village deity. Shut up! You close your eyes and have chips. You go ahead sir... "Alanati song from the film Murari" Hey... Were you dreaming? You were laughing real hard. I dreamt that we got married and you drowned in confetti. So, you have already gotten to drowning me. What? Shh! Don't disturb me. I'm gonne dream now. "Sannajaji Pakka Meeda song from the movie Vajrayudham" [screaming] Why did I shout in her place? Why did you scream? You dreamt of our wedding night. I dreamt of our first night. You were getting real wild. You made me scream aloud. Oh my God! Oh! I won't talk to you. Take it easy, I was just kidding. Anyways, I asked you to place the letter at home. Did you do it? Yeah, I did. Here... I also got a photocopy of it. You should've distributed pamphlets instead. -Forget it. Read what it says. -You calm down. 'Dear father, mother, brother and sister-in-law...' 'Dear neighbors, citizens and late grandpa...' What the hell is this? You keep quiet. Dad! I came home fearlessly when I failed 10th grade. Wasn't it then that I first flirted with you? I came home bravely though I lost my earrings in 11th grade. Hey, I dodn't know about the earrings. You were my strength every time, dad. But, Adi gives me greater strength now. I'm writing this letter as I couldn't gather courage to tell you. I am leaving with Adi who loves me more than life. I couldn't find the jewelry bought for my wedding. Damn! I am taking the one lakh from the locker for the sake of dowry. Don't look for that money and don't search for us too. I will be back home once things settle down. So, shall we leave right away? I hope you'd bless us when we return home with a child in a year. Now that you mention our child, we have to get to work. Forget about that work. Have you written the letter? Are you asking me that? I don't lag the issue like you. I only have one word to say. I shoot right at it. And what did you exactly say? 'I am eloping with her. I dare you to catch us.' 'Mess with Adi if you want to screw up your lives.' -That's all. -Hey! This guy reacts really weird. And why do you have to announce about the money to them? It was you who asked me to read it out. I asked you to read it. Not make an announcement. Anyways, you brought money for us. I've got something for you too. -What's that? -Close your eyes. Come on show it. Ta-da! [gasp] -Do you like it? -Yeah. I've kind of seen this face... [gasps] Let's get down. Hush! Thank you. -Brother... -Yeah. I'll walk from here. What you see there is my village. Roads aren't good. Thank you very much. Brothers... rather than enjoying this liquor for separating them... I'd be happy if you have it in the joy of uniting them. -Let's unite them then! -Mixing mixing. Not a big deal, sir! [chuckles] [claps] -Bye brother. -Okay, bye. See you, I love you. Thank you. I love you! Hey, start the vehicle. Aah! What's wrong grandpa? I'm not trying to kiss him. I was wondering if I've seen him earlier. Why do you hit me? Stop the car. I will get down here. -Here? -Yeah, right here. Sit tight. We will reach a village soon. -It's upto you once I drop you there. -No way. I will get down right here. [vehicle halts] -Let go of me. -No. -Let go. -Why'd you get down the jeep? -Let me go. -Get in the jeep. I will go. Leave me. I will drop you at the next village man! [groans] I will kill you. Hey! [gasping] [stone rolling] What? Are you planning to get me caught too? I'll kill you. Hey! [metal blow] [screaming] [groans] [metal clanking] Sir, it was by mistake. I was just trying to scare you. Paru, tell him. Adi!. [groans conitune] Careful! Adi... That guy was right about Earth being round. How do you feel now Adi? You aren't hurt, are you? I am fine, but, where's the jeep? Where'd the road go? -Where the hell are we? -Everyting is here. Just turn around. Oh! We are right here! Adi, I am really scared. Let's go. Why are you scared, sweetheart? I am right here. Grandpa is wrapping the million prize money. -No. -Come on. Both the guys are one and the same. Same beard... Ah, yes! We need to lift him up. Lend me a hand. Oh you want me to? Oh! I'll help you only if you give me half the share. If not take it easy. -Hey. Get lost man! -Huh? -Go. -Let's leave. -Wait a min! -Get up! -Let's go Adi. -Please don't cry. He will get the million. -Grandpa... Please Grandpa -Adi I am yet to get married. I eloped with the girl I love. I really need money. You've retired anyways. You can run your life on pension. I don't even hold a job, grandpa. I am not sure about my job, but am sure she'll have kids soon. I will need money. 50-50 or 40-60? 30-70 is final... Woah! -Grandpa. -Hmmm. Grandpa, I've fought like a soldier at war to catch him. There's no way you old man could find him. Please, grandpa. [struggles] Grandpa... I got you grandpa! Now you lift him. Isn't grandpa a veteran weight lifter? He will lift him. Lift him up grandpa. Come on... Use all your strength. You'll have the power to lift his finger now. With some effort, you will soon lift his leg up. He will wake up meanwhile. And then it's your death. Jangayya grandpa... You'll be no more. Why do we need this? Let's go, Adi. Are you crazy? When an old man is going mad for money, what about us? Grandpa, you carry on. I don't think he'll wake up. Do I sing a song to inspire you? [Le le le song from film Prema Nagar] What are you looking at? No one is going to appear even if you scream out loud. I'm all you have. All right, I'll give the share. -Come on, lift him up. -Oh really? I don't want 30 percent now. -I want 50 percent. -Eh? 50... Okay. I'll give it. -Really? -Yeah, I will. Swear on your grandsons? I promise. -Swear on your children? -I promise. Not just like that! Promise on their lives? I promise on the lives on all my heirs. Thank god! Grandpa is on track baby. Let's get the body into the vehicle. Do we need this right now? It's a million bucks! Your dad would've to go topsy-turvy to earn this. -Come. -Come on man. Just like the gifts showered by relatives to a newly wed couple... ...this is a gift from God to us. He is the blue print to our future plan. Hey, can you drive a car? I've driven a girl till here. Wouldn't I know to drive a car? I somehow feel really scared, Adi. -We know nothing about them. Let's leave. -That is why I made him promise. His grandsons are so gone if he alters by his promise. Hey, madman... I don't even have kids. What about grandsons then? How on earth will I have grandsons when I have no kids? Don't you worry. The old man is kidding. Comedy, you see... Hey, drive the car. You go and sit. Grandpa, you have no kids or family. Why don't you hike my share? Let's hand him over to the police first. You can keep all the money we get as a reward later. -I can have it all? -Yes. Well said, grandpa! You are not just a grandpa. You are my savior. -You've gone crazy for money. -Ain't it for our future? Keep your money. Let me go. Paru... What the hell! Paru... Where are you going? Don't get upset for petty issues, Paru. You are more fond of money than me. Everything comes after you. Whatever I do is for us. [vehicle approaching] You don't have to go. The goons are here for us. Come on... "Rama Rama Rey... Oh Rama!

How dare you break my bottle? I will kill you. I will chop you into pieces. That's my bottle. Do you know how many grapes are squeezed to fill one? Hey, idiot... [punch] Why are you battling it out for a bloody bottle? [slap] How dare you call it bloody? What do you know about the taste of wine untouched for years? It's nectar, man. Nectar! [sobbing] And you have wasted such nectar. [slap] How could you break my bottle? I will break your head now. You idiot! Guys, I am done with you two. I promise to get you bigger and tastier bottles. Okay? If you don't, we'll smack you like we smacked him. Promise! -Promise. -Promise. -Leave him. -You fool. Babji is giving me a headache. Don't get worked up, sir. Someone would find him for the million rupee reward. He has to die before that happens. He will anyways be dead once we find him. Before someone finds him and before he dies once he's caught... Anything can happen. He is a headache as long as he lives. Okay, tell me the deal sir. What's new to mention? Just the regular... They are paying a million if he is caught. Take that million right now. We'll think about the rest 15 once the deal is closed. Here's his photo. -You must've seen it. -Damn! Reports suggest he is in your area. The information is right, sir. Both the victim and the killer are together. I've seen him in hangman Jangayya's vehicle. I didn't bother due to the morning rush. 24 hours, sir... Keep the cash ready. You can relax now. [music] [music] [groaning] [air flowing] Do you think he is on internet to search and find him? He's hiding in the hills. I will call you after finding him. Hang up. Adi! Someone is coming. Don't worry, darling. I will take care of it. They just got lucky. Hey! You do not know about me. You know how many bombs blasted right in my hand? Let's go. Where to? Are we going near that jeep? Yeah! Ain't our treasure in there? Forget about that. Our money is in that jeep too. Is that 1 lakh in that jeep? You! How peacefully are you conveying this dangerous news! I can earn a jackpot in Rummy circle game if I have that money. Let's go and search for the jeep. We don't need money. We are together. That's enough. Let's go. Yeah. Let's go to Birla temple. You sit on the first stair and I'll take second. -What for? -To ask for alms. Crazy girl! No one will treat you well when you don't have money. Money has great value these days Money gives us status and reputation. Money gives satisfaction and everything. And that world belongs to you baby. Come! Let us search for the jeep. [motorcycle approaching] Hey, Ravi! How are you? Bro! Sister-in-law was suffering with labor pain. So, aunt took her to the hospital. -When? -Just now. -Give me your bike. -Here. Take it. -Put this bag in my house. -Okay. I will go to the hospital. Is it Nirmala hospital? -Take care, bro. -Okay. [motorcycle approaching] Hey, Jangayya! [groans] Where is that guy who was with you in the morning? He is a most wanted guy. There's a reward of 10 lakhs. Do you know it? We should hand him over to the cops. DOn't you know it? Am I not a cop? Where is he? I got some work with him. Can't you see? He hit me and ran away. We can't find him anymore. Law, Justice, Equity, and Punishment will not help us always. A philosophy is never strong. A strong person doesn't need philosophy. [motorcycle leaving] [groans] [sobs] Try to resist the pain. -The driver went out to ask for help. -I can't bear it. I can't hold it anymore. Try to hold it my dear. I will check if anyone is available. [groaning] [music] [screaming] Get up and untie me. -I'll kill you if you don't untie me. -Hey... Where would you run? You cannot escape. It's not me who tied you up. Adi did it. He is the one who hit me. He went out to get henchmen. They'll kill you if they find you. Go and hide in the jeep. Go. Someone is coming this way. Go. Get in! [metal door shuts] [panting] Sir... My daughter-in-law suffers labor pain. The auto has a trouble. You have to help us. Please, Sir. Oh no, no! You are badly hurt. How could you sustain such bleeding? Oh no, no! [fabric rips] Oh, no! [fabric rips] [groaning] Sir. Please save my daughter-in-law. [vehicle starts] -Does he belong to your place? -No. -Is he your relative? -No! -Is he your friend? -No. Then, he is definitely lucky for us. Come. Let's go. Sir! -Help us with a ride. Please, sir. -Sorry. -I have to go immediately. -Sir! We are badly in need and we're even ready to fight for it. But, I don't have that strength to fight now. You don't look that weak to get hit. -Why don't you listen to me? -Sir! We don't have time to talk. Ask! -Oh God! -Please, sir. Get on. He agreed to it. Get on. Come. Adjust yourself, sir. We shouldn't trouble women. Sit on the tank please. -How long have you been driving, Sir? -Why? You got my feet instead of the gear. Watch it. That's the auto. Go that way. Oh no! Get up. We are almost there. O God! What have I done? No one is nearby. Who will save my daughter-in-law? Oh no! [coughing] You are our savior. God has sent you. [panting] [panting] [indistinct woman crying] Help us son. Try to understand my pain. [indistinct woman crying] Gowri might lose her life if it gets late. [indistinct woman crying] No one is nearby. [indistinct woman crying] -I plead you son. Son! -Move! Sir! Open your eyes. Come and save my daughter-in-law. I plead you. He is inhuman. He behaves like a monster. Oh God! Who will save this child? Please get up! Please. Oh God! [groaning] Please hold on dear. Oh! Hold on dear. Hold on a little. Oh, no! -Oh no! Sir?? -Move... Hold on, dear?? Hold on a little. Hold her hand. Brother! [sobbing] Hold it, dear. Try to take a step. [woman groaning in labour pain] Please hold on girl. [sobs] Oh, no! [sobbing continues] Hold yourself, dear. Son! Hold on, dear. My dear! Hold yourself. Hold on, dear. [Sobbing continues] -Help us. -Get up, dear. Get up. Careful, Sir. [vehicle ignition] Hold it dear -Hold yourself. -Here. Push the vehicle. Hold yourself, dear. [vehicle ignition] [vehicle ignition] Oh, no??She might give birth here Sir! She might give birth here. We don't have time to go to the hospital. Oh, no! Oh God! [loud groaning] [woman screaming] [baby crying] [baby crying continues] [music] [indistinct train honking] Paru! Look there. -Sir. We should get down here. Stop. -Should I stop here? What for? This is our place. We should get down here. Please stop. This is my place sir. How can it be? This is my place. I know everyone in this place. I mean, our place is the same. We can call it a neighboring village. I plead you. Go away, Sir. -You're creating a mess man. -Hey, Sridhar. Mom? Why are you here? Come, I'll tell you. Where are you going? Look at that guy with beard. He looks like a terrorist. -We don't want that money. Let us go. -How can we escape now? The vehicle is ready with the key. Let's go. Will you steal the vehicle? Aren't you ashamed? I wasn't ashamed of eloping with you. Why should I be about the vehicle? There are many people here. He cannot harm us. Come. [indistinct baby cry] Where are you headed? Namasthe! Sir. For the help you have done?? Thanks a lot sir. Help us a little if you don't mind. Please drop my mom and Gowri at my house. It's not far away. Vehicles don't come in this way. So, please! Okay. Thank you so much, Sir. And please have dinner at my place, rest and start in the morning. Please don't say no. Thank you. Mom! You and Gowri can come home in the vehicle. [metal door closes] -Congratulations -Thank you. -What happened, Sir? -I'm the father of a baby boy. -Was he born in this vehicle? -Yes. Congrats, Sir. -You saved the hospital charges. -Thank you very much. Let's go. Where to? -I have a lot of work. I will come later. -Where? To escape, isn't it? Come with me. You can go tomorrow. Listen sir. Listen! You are being chased. They are very angry. Listen to me. They will be cursed for their mistakes. Let's go. Girl! Come in the vehicle. Get in?? [motorcycle starts] [music] ??How do we cope up with your strange games oh Lord Shiva!" ??The pain of birth and death is the fate you penned" ??Sky and the land serve us the same?? "Why create the unnecessary bias?" "Every human is a captive of the pain in relations" "Happiness and suffering are the same to all the people in this world" ??How do we cope up with your strange games oh Lord Shiva!" ??We just keep struggling in between birth and death" ??Shower us your mercy, oh Lord Shiva, the Bhola Shankar???? "Hail, Shambho Siva! Hail, Samba Siva!" "Bless us with your grace" [music] Why are you gloomy? Forgive me, Gowri. [infant voice] I wasn't there with you when you needed me. That wasn't your mistake. Your son wants to see you. That is why he came out soon. We could talk like this as everything went well. Otherwise.. You are a soldier who saves millions of lives. Wouldn't there be just one person to save your family? [infant voice] He is a military guy! Babji would be screwed if I inform this military guy about him. 'Are you out of your mind?' [indistinct slap] 'You should be thrashed.' Looks like something is broken already. -Brother. -Shut up. Why did I ask you to stay here? -Listen Brother! -What did you do? Oh this guy? Damn! What if something happened to them? My life would've been screwed. -I should kill you. Wait, mom. -Leave him?? -Wait mom -Leave him. How can he be held responsible for the early delivery? He went out to buy the cradle. Was it his mistake? You should understand that anger brings out the monster in a human. I couldn't understand my brother's love. I did a mistake by hitting him. Be it with love or hatred, a mistake remains a mistake. Yes, Jangayya! Sometimes even a tiny mistake can screw lives up. So, you parents did not agree because of caste. Hmm... This happens everywhere. Human has even set foot over the moon, but is unable to set a foot out of casteism. Aunty! What is it son? -Is it your son in the armed forces? -Yes, dear. Why? Do you know about Babji? [laughs] I know that he is our savior. He looks like a person who practices witchcraft. He is not a savior but a demon. -Actually he is... -Listen! God can take any form to help us. He came in the form of folly to you. He has become the light of our home today. I'll be right back. Light of your home! He'll torch your home. Go?? But he'd pay for all my bills! What do you say, Paru? -Can't you remain silent at all? -I will be silent. What will you do if he kills me? You seem more worried about death than the one who is sentenced to death. I'll obviously be worried. Am I not here? Nothing will happen to you. Can a mouse stop a cat? Don't be scared always. He should kill me before he kills you. No evil eyes shall fall upon you. [infant voice] I get goosebumps remembering what you went through to give him birth. to get him to this world. What is this? I should be happily married but am dressing up your injury. Grandpa, was it the prisoner who hit you? -Babji bro. -Yeah? Adi is not a bad guy. His talk is a bit irritable, but he has a kind heart. Don't hold a grudge on him just because he hit you. If something happens to him... [gasps] We will go away in the morning. [kitchen ware crackling] Mom! Serve me some ridge gourd. But you don't like it son! Younger brother likes it, doesn't he? I know where he'd be. You can cover up some mistakes. But, not every mistake. Anyway, it's common to make mistakes. It's wrong if we do not repent for our mistakes. Running away from it is a mistake. So, do you say running away a mistake? -No one can run away from their heart. -Not everyone has a heart. Every human has a heart and good or bad in it. Lord Shiva holding Ganga on his head has poison in his throat. Ill never has the freedom good has. And good doesn't have the attraction ill has. That's enough. No it isn't. For the help you did to us today... ...my life served on a plate is less too. What's so great about his help? There's nothing called a great help son. It's just a great heart! He saved 2 lives in our family without expecting anything in return. Two? Are they twins? [laughs] It doesn't mean they're twins. The lives of mother and baby. Because the mother takes up a new life after giving birth. [infant crying] [lullaby] Oh, dear! My baby! Brother! Did you wake up because of baby's cry? No. [baby crying] [music] "A rope that's a hangman's noose" "can become a cradle" "A rope that takes lives" "can become a cradle" "Both the day and night" "stay together always" ??They play along?? "There's no place for sorrow at the time of lullaby" "Why do you need a death percussion in a place filled with life" "Sleep dear" [infant voice] [lullaby] [rainfall] [thunders] [music] [thunders] [thunders] [rooster crows] [birds chirping] -Take this towel. -These are my new clothes, sir. You have to wear it as a gift from the child. Here brother. I don't have siblings. You saved me like a brother. Take good care of her. -See you. -Take care. Sir! I planned to buy clothes if it was a boy. You arrived like a father. Please accept these clothes without denying it sir. Please. [music] I don't know who you are. Neither do I know your source and destination. We accidentally met. But, there should be a reason for everything. I sense a tinge of enemity between you both. I don't want to talk too much. Whoever asks for an apology among you is the brave guy. The one who can forgive is the strongest. Our anger is our punishment. Lord Shiva will save and punish us. Someone like this young man should live long. Lead him on the right path like your son. See you, madam! See you. [vehicle starts] [music] -Grandpa! -Yeah. Stop here. We will get down. -See you, grandpa. -Yeah. Bless you. Paru! They've come again. Let's go. Adi. [tyres screeching] Stop the vehicle. We got them. We found them! Hey, wait! Let them finish a round. Hey, stupid! [slap] Leave Paru alone. You set an eye on our girl? -Let go! -Come... [bashing] We got them. The show just started. Full of action. [bashing] I will record it and share on Facebook and Whatsapp after this call. Show it to everyone. -Hey wait -Please... What does he have? -Where are you going? Stop! -Adi... Hey! Good boy. Leave him?? [kick] Hey, stop it. -Hey! -Adi! If you hit me again. [snapping] I'll die. I plead you. Will you kill me? Why did you get such hefty men to hit me? Hey! Stop man! Let's discuss and settle it. -Follow me. -Let's go. Don't worry, dear. Nothing will happen to Aadhi. [gasps] Come and stand in a queue. Are you in a que before a loo? Turn here. Tell me what you get if you hit me. We will be respected in our caste and the other caste gets scared. Caste, Respect, Fear! What will you achieve with them? Does it fetch a single meal? Let me tell you something that can change your life. You don't even have a vehicle to take the girl. Don't talk about changing lives. With this. Look at this. Observe well. -It is very nice. -What's nice in this? What are you looking at? Look at this. Come and see. We can see that anytime. Turn it. [chuckles] -Is your wife out of the station? -Yes. That's evident. Idiot! This is the important thing. See it. Did you see? -Yeah?? -Look at that guy near the vehicle. Did you see someone like a love failure? -Yes. We can see him. -Shh! Why are you shouting like buffalloes? Keep it low! -He is the one in the pic. -Oh! He is a prisoner who escaped from the prison. There's reward money of 10 lakhs if you hand him over to the cops. I will give that money to you. -Do we get everything? -No, dude! I'll share it with the chief ministers of the states. -That's ours. -Will they give us cash or cheque? That depends on you. It is your wish if it is in cheque or cash, legal or not. -But, there shouldn't be any discrimination. -No?? Discuss it and come to a decision. I'll go and get him in the vehicle. -Yeah, okay... -Move please! -Sir is so good! -Yes man. Sir?? Let's go. Paru! Get in the vehicle. Come. Hurry up. Her parents are happy at home. But, we are suffering in this hot sun. So, we should share the amount equally. [vehicle starts] Yeah, right. He's right though he is young. [vehicle leaving] Right! Let us all share it equally. -Yes -I agree. Guys! They are escaping. No! He went to get the reward money. Is it? He is escaping and you expect money to play cards? Wake up man! Go and get him! -Let's go. -Start the vehicle. Adi! What did you tell them? I told them that we get 10 lakhs if we hand you over to the cops. I said I will give the money to them. They left me for money sir. They're not coming for us but for you. How can people like them understand our love? That is why I tricked them. I am brave enough to love but not strong enough to fight them. No other way than this struck my mind sir. Sorry, sir Sorry. [vehicle halts] [tyres screeching] -Catch him! -I will finish you. Come?? We have to finish him. -Hey! -Hey! We are here to get him but not to die. And he is a murderer too. Remember? Hey, Adi! Take out the holy thread. Take it out. Tie the knot. Tie it now! Hello, uncle! He tied the knot to Paru. Ask him not to be sad. Okay. Our priest just saw his horoscope. He has a good future after marriage. Bring them back safely. -What about the caste then? -Caste is nothing before cash. That's right, uncle. -We got the green signal. -Hey, let's go. [whistles] Grandpa. God bless you for life. Livelong. Take care. Thank you. Thank you sir. Thank you so much, brother. [chuckles] You got married at last! Congratulations! Cheers! Very good. -Happy Father's day! Happy Mother's day! -Happy Children's day. Naughty! Do something. Both of you mixx well like a cocktail. Okay? Done. Enjoy. Get on the bike. [chuckles] -Bye. -Bye. -Goodbye. -Bye. Come, let's go. [vehicles start] Babji bro. Where do your people stay? My people? I do not have anyone. What about you? I have but of no use. So you don't have anyone to care about your life. [laughs] There's no one to take care of your funeral rites either. People who don't care for us when we exist don't matter when we pass away. [sighs] This is written by the Superintendent of Prisons. To serve as the hangman, [music] [tyres screeching] Did you see him somewhere? No, Sir. I haven't seen him anywhere. -I asked him. -I said whatever he had to say. Hey! -What happened, son-in-law? -Nothing?? Come. I will tell you. How can it be nothing? The cop looks suspicious. -You look scared. -It's nothing. Let's go. Hey! Did you see him somewhere? Do you mean this boy? He is a very good boy. Tall boy! Great boy! He is a life saver! -Absolutely. -Hey, tell me. He is a very bad boy. Sir, leave it. We don't know that guy. Don't you know him? -He is the one who got you married. -Shh! -What is that? -Hey! Are you acting smart? Sir! How can you believe a drunkard? I'll shoot your head off like a bottle you rascal. Tell me where he is. You are right. Death gives redemption. Life gives satisfaction. If you are destined to live, ills turn into good... Hatred will turn to love. Anger will turn to pity. Even death will turn into life. Life will turn into a burden. [chuckles] You've changed son. Yeah. I studied about animals. Can't I understand humans? [noisy engine] [engine stops] [ignition sound] Can you get down and push. [ignition] [vehicle starts] [music] [vehicle halts] [tyres screeching] Where is Babji? I don't know. [slap] Hey! I know that he was in your vehicle. I will kill you if you don't tell the truth. Sir. I really don't know. [truck halts] People find girls on highways. But, why do I always find you? Did the old man get irritated by your face already? Come, get in. [strangling] Hey! I thought to kill just one. But, I should kill both. -It's okay. It's for 25 lakhs! -Sir I don't... Tell me! Sir! I don't know anything. Leave me. He is not in the vehicle. Hey! I am telling the truth. [bang] [groaning] Hey! He is the CI of our area. He might die if we don't admit him to a hospital. My vehicle has turned into an ambulance ever since I helped you. Go! Sir, get up. Sir? [groaning] Why did you come again? You would die if it wasn't for me. You will die anyway. Why do they want to encounter you? Who wants your life other than law and why? They're scared that I might tell the truth behind my death sentence. So didn't you kill anyone? I did. [train honking] I fell in love with Sujatha. She got another match and she hanged herself. I hit Sujatha's father in anger. He died. I surrendered myself in the police station. There was a death of a serial killer that night behind the bars. SP made out a plan to save himself. They presented me at the court instead of that prisoner. The court punished me with death penalty. I was called a maniac by the society. Didn't you approach the high court? I thought that my death will unite me with my love. Then why are you escaping now? [laughs] Are you afraid of death now? Fear neither saves you from death [train honking] nor lets you live. A crime has been committed. You might not be responsible for it. But it's completely your responsibility if you'll remain to be a criminal. There are 3 ways faced by a criminal. The first one is to get punished for the crime. The second is to escape from the punishment. The third is to fight with law and order about the punishment. Whether it is right or wrong, We are not sure if the court's decision is true. The only witness for a truth and a lie, wrong and right is the heart itself. Do whatever your heart says. [music] [metal screeching] [tyres screeching] [music] Jangayya! I felt to do what my heart says. While cops have announced reward money and went in search of him. It is surprising that he surrendered himself. [music] There are too many requests for amnesty of Babji to the President from various organistions. The President rejected Babji's proposal of amnesty. [moped approaching] [vehicle halts] Lord Shiva! I didn't understand you. I cannot understand your plans. [sobbing] [vehicle arriving] [doors creaking] [jail door creaks] [music] Do you have a last wish? Do you want to eat something? Do you want to talk to someone for a last time? Whom do we hand over your body? Jangayya. [music] [snipping] [music] [music] [music] [heart pounding] [music] [patting] [thud] [music] Jangayya! [screaming] JANGAYYA: There's no one to take care of your funeral rites either. "Ain't it a game oh Lord Shiva?" "Aint it a game lord?" "Ain't it your game oh Lord Shiva!" "It's a game for you by oath!" "Ain't it a game oh Lord Shiva?" "Aint it a game lord?" "Aren't birth and death your game?"
