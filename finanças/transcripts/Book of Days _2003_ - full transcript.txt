(soft music) (organ music) - Come on, Frankie, where are you? - Whatever are you doing out here? Hold still. - Now don't you listen to Sister Mary stick in the mud Agnes. Here's what you do. - Sister Grady. - I don't think you should speak of it. We're in the house of God. - Well, somebody's got to tell her. It might as well be someone who knows. - You know? - Caroline, some like yourself came to this order pure as the driven snow. Others have reason to repent. - Oh, for goodness sake. (women giggling) - You look lovely, lovely. - I can't get married without my best man. - My dear, Frankie was an inappropriate choice from the start. Now this is enough of a spectacle you marrying a nun. Come on. - She's not a nun. She's a novice and not anymore. (organ music) Glad you could make it. - Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the presence of God to unite our dear Caroline and her chosen Daniel in the bounds of holy matrimony. Who gives this woman to be married? - I do. (bells tolling) (camera clicking) (crowd applauding) - [Guest] Do you know where they're going? - Okay. - Okay. - Alright get out of here. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. (camera clicking) - Bye. - Bye. - Have you ever felt more alive? (horn honking) (loud crash) (people gasping) (somber music) (siren blaring) - How's he doing? - He's okay. Not a scratch. Maybe you can get him to talk. I couldn't. - Okay. (footsteps approaching) - I suppose you're going to tell me that this was God's will. - No. - But he knew. He knew and he didn't do anything. - No. - It must be a really great gig to be God. You're invincible, so nobody can kill you. You're invisible, so if you hack somebody off they can't come looking for you. You're omniscient. It must be really nice to hold all the freaking cards. - He loved her too, you know. - I know. She belonged to him. They were practically engaged till I came along, so he took her back. - He received her when it happened. (somber music) But I don't think he took her. - Have you thought about what a chain of events this was? If things had just been one second off just one, if that truck had left one second earlier, or come one second later, if I'd dropped my keys, Caroline stops to kiss one other person goodbye, it would've been different. She was an angel. - I've thought that a time or two myself. - Was one second too much to ask from him? - Knock, knock. Hello. Um, have you completely lost all sense of paranoia. I mean I could be anybody, you know, a thief or mugger. - Well, if you were you'd be wasting your time. I don't have anything. Between the wedding and the funeral. - Well, what about the other guy's insurance? - It's this wonderful liability loophole. See if the insured motorist is DUI, his insurance company doesn't have to pay. Guess who was DUI? - Okay. I got something I need to tell you. I'm not exactly sure how I'm gonna. It's really your decision though. On account that even though it resulted from something I did technically it's not about me. It's about you. - Frankie. - With you understandably needing money from sources other than your mother I-- - Frankie, if you could maybe just say it. - My editor has offered me a lot of money for the pictures. - From my wedding? - The accident. (soft knocking) - [Delivery Man] Citywide. - Hang on. Hey, look I appreciate you climbing all those stairs, but he's not accepting anymore wedding gifts and it's just. - As far as I know this ain't a wedding gift. No return address on it, so I'll just be leaving it here. - Oh, okay. Here you go. - No, miss. Thank you though. I'll just be going. - What kind of guy in this city blows off a tip. You order something? - No. Wait. No. No, I didn't. - You thing it's a bomb. - Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact I'm certain that this is a bomb. Do you wanna know why? 'Cause there's this guy, and he's sitting in a room by himself somewhere and he goes, Oh, Danny Hartland of course. I better send him a bomb. Ethel, Ethel put down the cat where's my bomb? I have to send a bomb to Danny Hartland. - [Frankie] Danny. Well, what is that? (dramatic music) - It's a book. What am I supposed to do with this? - [Frankie] Read it. - Yeah, well, it turns out I don't read Latin. - I wonder if it's a birthday list. - What? - Yeah, let's see. Hartland. - Oh, come on I'm gonna be in there? That thing is like 200 years old. - Aha, Hartland. Daniel, Daniel, Daniel A. Hartland, March 19th '69. That's your birthday. - My birthday is '70. - No, it's not it's '69. - Frankie, my birthday is '70. - I don't know maybe it's worth some money. (dramatic music) - Book of Days. - What do all the names and dates mean? - Well, if this book is what I think it is, it's quite rare. Can you leave this with me for a few days? I'd like to show some of my colleagues. - Sure. - [Worthington] You could've taken the rest of the week. - I know. I have my rent due so. - You did get the flowers I sent? - Yes, I did. Thank you very much. - Now the problem I'm having is this policy you sold yourself on Caroline. You opted to save some money on a 60-day waiting period. - Which she was within eight hours of satisfying. - But sadly did not. - I've worked for you for seven years. I've seen you make exceptions. (soft chuckling) - Risking the considerable wrath of our underwriters. - Oh, come on this is such a technicality. - If it had been eight hours in your favor, do you think I would've asked not to pay? - I need this money, Mr. Worthington. - No, you need to live by your choices the same way your customers do when they roll the dice and delay coverage. - My wife is dead. (somber music) And it is all I can do to keep it together enough to be here and I need this. I need something to help me out, to tide me over. - Very sorry about what happened. But I have to tell you the truth. Yes, you are a long time employee, but lately your performance has left a lot to be desired. - This is the ax. - No, no, no. We don't play to extremes here. I don't believe it's in your best interest if I bail you out. You've been coasting, Danny. I mean living on your client inventory, zero growth. Now when's the last time you were hot, when you topped your quotas. - I don't know. I guess it was about a year ago. - When you were hanging by your fingernails trying to keep the bank from repossessing your car. - That inventory is still paying off. - As sales go that was your shining moment. The commissions were rolling in and you had the personal satisfaction of triumphing over the big bad wolf. Now let me remind you that I've had wolves of my own. That Y2K fiasco back then (chuckling) ate my lunch. I'll be paying that off until the next millennium. But did I shirk on OT? Did I go to any one of you and ask you to kick in a nickel? No, I took responsibility for my choices, and I expect the same thing from you. - Listen I appreciate this. But I kicked my mom out of town. - So. - So I can cook for myself. - Well, you haven't not since... I mean maybe it's not in your nature, but you can let somebody help you. - You can say her name. - I know. I know. It's just. - Well, then say it. Caroline. - Caroline. - Remind me again why I do this for a living? - Why do any of us do what we do? It's not like in college, you know when I was studying all that great photography. I mean it's not like I aspire to be some bottom feeding paparazzi for a rag sheet. - Went to see Worthington today. He is the master of positioning. I'm looking to catch a little bit of a break considering. He acts all sympathetic, and then he totally turns it around on me starts talking about Y2K. - What. What. (dramatic music) - I have to go and check something and make sure that I am ridiculously wrong and just leave it at that. - Danny. Danny. Danny, who are you looking up? Danny. Caroline W. Hartland, June 26th. Well, that was when she. - What's your mother's name? - Mary Frances, I mean Mary F. Newhall. - [Danny] When did she die? - Day after Christmas 1989. - 12/29/89. - What are these death dates? - Reavis. - Who's that? - One of my clients died today. Reavis, Walter P. Reavis. It's today's date. (dramatic music) Do you want me to look it up for you? - Like I wouldn't see the look on your face. What I don't get is who would send you this kind of a book. You know, who has this kind of data? - I don't know. It sure is creepy though. Walter P. Reavis that was today. That was after we got the book. - After you got the book it's not mine remember. It's yours. I don't wanna get any of these weird heebie jeeby vibes off the thing. It's yours not mine keep it straight. Don't you think it's better not to know? - It was for Caroline. I will never be able to get that image out of my head. She was sitting there so happy and so serene and that grill just came in behind her. But if I knew. - What would you have done? I mean it's not like you knew how it was gonna happen or what time. All you had was the date. There is some things, death for example they're way beyond your control. - Thanks for printing these pictures out for me, Frankie. Hey, are these for your two bit rag sheet? Because they're really good. - No, there're for someday, you know if Time Magazine or Newsweek calls or some gallery. I don't know why I torture myself. Okay, sure you wanna see these? - Okay, I need to have a new picture in my head. - It should take a couple of seconds. - Okay. Do you believe in Heaven? - Honestly. - No, I want you to lie to me. - Okay, I just didn't wanna leave you feeling like that's not where I thought she was. - So you don't. - Well, believing in Heaven has presupposing believing in God and I don't really think about it. (printer whirling) You okay? - Yeah, thank you. Whoa. - What? - No, it's just. - Frankie. - No, no. Give me a second. What is he doing there? What could he possibly. Do you know him? - Who? - This guy. That's the messenger, the guy with the book. - Oh, come on. - No. I know faces that's the guy. - [Bob] Worthington live this is Bob speaking. How can I help you? - [Male] Hello, Worthington Life may I help you? - Morning everyone. You clocked in at what? - 9:00 a.m., sir. - And what have we accomplished thus far? - Well, actually I made some phone calls. - Two service calls to long standing clients. - Are you monitoring my line? - Theoretically at least. I pay you to work. - You know there is paid bereavement that I haven't taken. I am here and I am getting things done. - These are your new quotas. You'll notice they're in weekly increments. - What. But this is double what I've ever. Where am I supposed to find these clients? - I don't care how you find them as long as you make your quotas. You miss one and you're on probation. You miss two and I dock your base. You miss three and, hey, hey that is the ball game. (soft mumbling) And push the immediate coverage plan. Coming from you it should be a compelling option. Keep working people sell, sell, sell. - Howdy. - Something I can do for you? - I'm just curious. Who are you? - Names Parks, Jonah Parks. - Jonah like the guy and the fish. - Yes, ma'am. My mama she said I looked just like some kind of beached whale before I was born. Took her three days of laboring before getting me out, so she thought it fitting. - Do you remember me? - Can't says I do. - Good. You didn't say you don't 'cause that would be lying wouldn't it? - You know, missy. - See, that's exactly what you called me last time Missy, when you came by Danny's apartment with the book. - Oh, that's what it was? - It's a good thing you brought it by though because Danny's been really low on cash. We pawned it it for 20 bucks. - 20, 20 bucks. Now who in creation would give you that much? - So you do know what it is. - (soft knocking) Hello. (telephone ringing) Danny. - [Danny] I'm changing would you get that? - Yeah, sure. Hello. - Oh, hello, Frankie. Do you think I could speak with my son? - Oh, hey, Amelia. He's busy right now. - Frankie, you seem like an intelligent girl so I'm gonna cut right to it. Notwithstanding any feelings you're harboring for my son I suggest you remember he's still grieving. - You don't think I know that? - [Amelia] Don't be coy. - What. - Your spending as much time as you apparently do with him is egregiously inappropriate. - Okay. Well, I'll just tell him that you called, bye. Did you know pizza is a perfect food? - Yeah, for having a heart attack. - Which you're not having till 2069, so what are you worried about? - I'm worried about what I'm gonna do until then. - Wanna know what I did today? - Ugh, more than anything. - I tracked down that guy, you know the messenger that brought the box with the book in it. - And? - You really don't appreciate me. - Oh, Frankie. - What does egregiously mean? - I'm sorry you're asking this now because? - I may wanna use it in a sentence. - Uh, egregiously is like something really, really out there like way over the top in a negative sense. - So this guy Jonah, that's his name he tries to pretend that he doesn't remember me (chuckling), but I see through it. I find out that he knows exactly what's in the box being the book. - Did he send it? - I don't know he seemed garden variety human to me. - You know that book it's sitting there in my living room with all this information in it that all these people would just kill for. Can you imagine if my boss got his hands on that book. - Oh, my gosh what about my editor. Please the guy would have himself a championship conniption. - Worthington would pretend that he was being altruistic and act like he was gonna help people, but he'd turn around and only sell to people who weren't gonna die for forever. At work today he gave me my new and improved quotas. - Sweet. - See according to him being madly in love and planning a wedding sort of negatively impacted my ability to sell. So, now that everything's changed he expects me to get out there and really hit the streets. He sits there and he gives me this big line of crap about how he's looking out for my best interest, but all he cares about is his bottom line. The thing that really, really torques me is I know if I go out there and I really bust my hump to meet these ridiculous quotas - These egregiously unrealistic quotas. - Yes. If I do that, all I am doing is lining his pocket. (dramatic music) - Unless. - What. - Well, no, no, no. I mean we couldn't do that. Well, maybe considering. - Today. - Well. What if you pulled your new and improved clientele from the book? - What? Do you mean. You mean the. The book, the book. - Yeah. You could look up people, you know people you know who are gonna be checking out soon. Can you imagine? - Yeah, I guess, but I couldn't actually. - Why not the guy's a worm. - Why do you think I got that book? - I don't know. - I was thinking about it. I think that maybe I got it because I'm supposed to do something. - You're not the only person that's been in this position, you know. - What of knowing every one's death date. - Of being completely under it because some greed ball insurance company wouldn't pay out based on a technicality. It's perfectly legal. Right, you might your quotas. You save tons of grieving people mega financial hardship. You sell them something you they're gonna need, and then you stick it to Worthington when they cash out. It's a thing of beauty if you ask me. - My name is Danny Hartland. I'm calling from Worthington Life Insurance Company. Hi, are you Sheri? - Yeah. - My name is Danny Hartland from Worthington Life Insurance. We spoke on the phone. (dramatic music) May I come in? - Okay. - Ladies and gentlemen, this is the day of the month that we all wait for. - Mr. Kindercheck, I'm very glad you called back. Yes, I'd love to see you tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow at 9:30. Great, yeah, not a problem. - My pleasure as president and owner of the Worthington Life Insurance Company. - Hello is that Mr. Hassen. Hello, Mr. Hassen my name is Daniel Hartland. I'm calling from Worthington Life Insurance Company. - Of the month to our own Daniel A. Hartland. - Thank you very much. Well, this Sonia Havarty's still on the street, and Edward Herdferd is still in the hospital, so no go on the preexisting condition. But the rest check out. Danny. - Frankie, look. - [Frankie] Hopkins Grady. Well, that's next week. - That's Sister Grady, the nun who gave Caroline away. - Oh, I'm sorry. - She found Caroline when she was abandoned in the orphanage. She was like a mother to her. (soft music) - [Joan] Worthington Life this is Joan may I help you? - [Bob] Worthington Life this is Bob speaking. How can I help you? (somber music) - [Female] Worthington Life may I help you? - [Male] Hello, Worthington Life may I help you? - So you're telling me that he talks to you. - Uh-huh. - Out loud. - Of course, out loud. I ain't no mind reader. - And he told you to give me the book. - Yes, sir, he did that. I'd never heard of no Book Of Days before I'd seen this one. Heard of the Book Of Life something different. But, you know, I found it right there Book Of Psalms. - The Book Of Psalms. - It says, In thy book they were all written. The days that were ordained for me. When as yet there was not one of them. - Oh, so of course you took this literally. - Every day they ever found in that book happened. I saw it with my own eyes. - Is that why you were there when Caroline died? - [Jonah] She had been mighty sweet to me. - [Danny] You knew her. - [Frankie] Just from my route. (dramatic music) - Well, couldn't you have-- - Stepped in, changed it. Not without a price to pay. - Which is? - You know when I was first seeing that book I flipped right past the cover page same as you probably did. - The one with the numbers. - Not just numbers more like to an address. That's when I found out. - Address to what? - Some things I suppose. Well, you just gonna have to go and be finding out for your own self. - Could we please lose the games. - Ain't no game. No, sir. - So you had this book and you ran through the maze. The whole time you never once felt like you were just some kind of freaking pawn? - Doesn't matter what I felt? The books yours now. You gotta be feeling it in your own self. That's the only way to know. - No what? - What you do. - You wanna know what Caroline's favorite day of the week was? She used to tell me this all the time when she was a little girl. Every day. Tuesdays is when we had apple dumplings. Wednesday was when we tended the garden round the abbey. Thursdays I don't remember what Thursday was. But Friday, Friday was always fresh sheets. Put your face in there breathe in. You can see why she loved that, huh? (soft music) - This really helps. What the. What is that? - You know, it's funny you should visit today because I was just talking about you. - You were. - Uh-huh. The nicest man called. His name was Edgar, Edgar Worthington. He wanted to talk to me about life insurance. - What. - As though I have money for that sort of thing. But I told him if I were to ever buy a policy, it would be from you. - Well. I thank you. Have you thought at all about those numbers I gave you the 4.15.13. - No, some kind of computer thing? - You know, I actually think that it might be some kind of God thing. - Or the fourth book, the fourth book is John. - Could it be John chapter 15 verse 13? - Greater love hath no man than this. That he lay his life down for a friend. - You know, I can finish all of this for you. You don't have to. - No, I asked you to help me not to do it for me (sighing). - Do you need to see a doctor? - No. I'm just incredibly out of shape. - Okay, alright, I got you. I got you lean on me. Lean on me. Alright we're gonna go right now. - Excuse us for a moment. Where is she? - She's having an angioplasty. - Well, she's not slated for another five days, so she's gonna make it. - How do I know that? - The book. - How do I know I didn't change something. If I hadn't known and wouldn't have gone there, then maybe she wouldn't have over done it for another week. - She's out. She did fine. - Is she gonna make a full recovery? - In all probability, yes. Good thing you brought her in when you did though. As bad as that blockage was, she wouldn't have lasted a week. - I think I might have changed something. - I told you, you were on your own. - I understand that, but if you could just give me a little bit of help. I'm really flying blind. - What do you mean might? Did you or didn't you? - Okay, not sure. At first I thought that maybe I moved it up, but now it looks like I might have extended it. - Well, did you look in the book? - No. - No sense guessing when it's right there in black and white. - How can it be a life for a life. You're still here aren't you? Maybe she'll die next week. - I'm supposed to hope for that. Okay, alright Hopkins. Hopkins, Hopkins, Hopkins, Hopkins. Promise my you're not gonna freak out. - I think we're way past the freaking out part. - Hopkins, Hopkins. It changed. - How could it change? - I don't know it changed. - [Frankie] What is this some kind of cosmic white out? - It's 10 years Frankie. I bought her 10 years. - Danny, oh, god please. - I thought you didn't believe in God. - I didn't believe in books with multiple choice death dates either now did I. Please be '69. Please be '69 still. Yours is '59. (soft music) - What? - You lost the 10 years you gave her. Oh, god. Oh, god. No, God. God, you change it back. You hear me change it back. - Frankie. - He didn't even know how fair is that? - Frankie, calm down. - No, this isn't happening. - It's okay. It's okay it's just 10 years. I'm still gonna be an old man, it's okay. - You're gonna go before me now. - You looked. - Yeah, I looked. I was gonna go first just before actually. No, this is completely unacceptable. - Frankie, it doesn't matter. - Of course it matters. - Why it's 60 years from now. - Because your mother was right. - My mother? - She saw it like why can't you? - Saw what? - Anything. Everything. - Frankie, we have a lot of time. - 10 years, Danny. 10 years how am I supposed to stand at your grave? I would've never made it past my mother's funeral if it wasn't for you. How am I supposed to stand at yours? - Frankie. - I know, I know. I've made this all about me. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I'm hating myself right now. I gotta go. I can't. I gotta go. - Looking for this. You know, Xerox is a wonderful thing. - Danny, can I see you in my office? Funny game this business. It's a misnomer really. Life insurance only pays off when you die. I suppose it would be off pudding if it was called death insurance even though that is what it is. - Point. - My point is that you're going to have to forgive Edgar, Danny. Come on now what is life without a little healthy competition, huh? I had to write another big check today. Lavinia Cooperton passed away last week. The family was shocked what with her being so young. We never know, do we? - I guess we don't. - Walter Reavis, Eugene Bates, and now Ms. Cooperton three substantial unrecouped pay outs. All of your clients ever since I lit that fire underneath you. - Well. - I notice on your list here that you put a date beside each name. - Walter Reavis isn't. - Yeah, well, the others. The others there they are checked off with the dates they died. - Yeah. Yeah, I like to follow up, so it's sort of a tickler file. - It's amazing though that they each died on the very day that you followed up and that there's are the only deaths in your list which have not past. I also noticed right here Lawrence Peersgail. You were planning on following up on him tomorrow. - Yeah. I just thought it seemed like good business. Don't you think? - You tell me. - So is it 10 years a pop? - No telling. All I saved possibly 14. Save a child, especially one that would've lived his self a good long time, and well you liable to flat out disappear. - What do you mean just poof you're gone? - Don't rightly know on account I ain't done it yet. But that seems to be the arithmetic of it. - That's why you didn't step in for Caroline. ♪ I still think of you ♪ Think of you ♪ I think of you - You know, it came that day and I was thinking I could. You always wanna believe that kind of thing about yourself. I put on my good suit, went over to the home, said goodbye to my mama, and walked myself straight to that church thinking I was gonna have myself a moment of truth. Then there she was, so pretty you, so full of hope, and me knowing inside my heart trying to make these bones move in her direction. Ain't proud of it about myself. But came time and I couldn't do it. I couldn't. That's the truth of it. Next day was when I got the word I was to give the book over to you. - Hi. - What is the life span of the average American male? - I don't know 70 maybe 80 years. Are we just gonna pretend that I didn't completely humiliate myself in front of you last night? - I thought that we might. - Oh. Well, okay then. - He knows. - He who what? - Worthington. His nephew found my list and he knows. How old is Lawrence Peersgail? - Isn't he the guy that's on deck? - Yeah, tomorrow and Worthington knows. - You didn't tell him did you? - No, of course not. But he kind of saw a pattern. - Lawrence Peersgail is 68 years old. - Okay, so that's like 20 years. - Oh, no, Danny. Danny, come on your life isn't some poker chip that you just cash in on some guy you don't even know. - If Lawrence Peersgail dies tomorrow, Worthington's gonna think I had something to do with it. I don't have a choice. - Danny, you always have a choice. - I've been thinking about that a lot. Knowing what I know now I would like to think that I would still save Sister Grady. She's a good person, Frankie. She raised Caroline like she was her own daughter. I can give her 10 years. - Oh, right. Oh, well, 10 years here. 20 some there where does it end? - Well, maybe when it counts for something. What is this about, Frankie? Are we supposed to just rack up as many years as we can? We get in the morning. We feed our faces. Run off to work, come home veg out in front of the TV and then crawl into bed so we can do it all over again. - Maybe the something you were supposed to do was saving Sister Grady. - So my something happens by default. - Where are you gonna be 10 years from now when her number's up again and you've cashed all your chips in on Lawrence Peersgails of the world? - I can't think about 10 years from now. All I can think about is tomorrow and what's gonna happen if this guy buys it. - [Operator] Dr. Perry's please call the ER. Dr. Perry, please. Dr. Binder, we need you in room three. - [Grady] Thank you. - Your welcome. - I'm going home today. - What? So soon. - Ugh, HMO insurance hooligans. Present company accepted of course. - Thank you. - You okay? - I think I should be asking you that. - You're missing Caroline. - Yeah. I'm having a very hard time understanding why her life was cut so short. - It wasn't cut short. Life isn't something best measured in days. Life is what you do with what you have. Caroline was loving and giving. She had about the purest heart of any soul I've ever known. She did it right, Danny, and she did it a lot sooner than most of us. - And now she's gone. - Not gone. Do you think for a minute you can kill a spirit like Caroline's? Death isn't the end. Death is just that unknowing sort of something we all have to go through on our way to eternity and that's where she is, my love. She got to go there on the happiest day of her life. - You're not afraid of it? Death, I mean. - I like my life. But if things had turned out the other way, it wouldn't have been so bad. - What are you doing here? - Following you, following them and then I decided I was famished. You want this? - You can have it. - [Frankie] So, have you figured out how it's gonna happen yet? - Based on the meal he just sucked down, my bet would be on a massive coronary. You know what's weird I've been sitting here for 35 minutes watching them on what is most likely the last day of his life. They haven't said two words to each other. - Think they had a fight? - I think they just ran out. - Maybe she secretly despises him, and he dies on account of her murdering him. - Frankie. - No, no, no, no listen. Then the policy won't pay out. You don't have to save him and you get your 20 years. - Look I'm doing this. - It's just a theory. - Pay it for me. - You're not ditching me. - Fine catch up. (dramatic music) (horn honking) (dramatic music) - You lost 21, so did Catherine Peersgail. - I don't even care anymore. - Don't say that. - I don't I'm done with this. I'm just gonna cash out. I've got a long list of young clients and I'll just cash it all in and I will go and be with Caroline again. - Danny. - I'm sorry. I know you don't wanna hear it. - Look I'm sorry but you saved a guy's life. Who's to say that his life is worth any less than hers? Now would you just put away this damsel in distress be a hero thing and consider for one moment that maybe he has some great something he needs to do. - That was his great something. That was his great something and I took it away from him. - Well, at least you're off the hook with Worthington. - I sold him a policy on her too. (soft knocking) Who is it? - Detective Krieber 13th precinct. I'd like a word with you. - Okay. Take the book go down the fire escape. I'll find you later, go, go. Just a second, detective. You caught me sort of in and on you know what I mean. Let me just do up my fly here I'll be right with you. - Just make sure you keep talking while you do it, Ace. - Alright, let me just button up here two more to go. Alright no need to kick in my door here we go. Guess I should've gone for the zipper, huh? (dramatic music) - You know he can't see you. - What's the point? He already knows I'm here. - Do you want some coffee? - No, thank you. - You know we don't do too many nice things around here. You ought to take advantage. - Am I under arrest? - Leaving the scene of an accident for starters. - Sam, you didn't have. - Oh, but I insisted. - Sam, our investigator saw the whole thing. He's already on top of it. Oh, Detective Krieber, this is Samuel Tucker underwriter with Worthington Life. - Peersgail's people called him directly when you hedged. - Anything yet? - Well, he just asked for a lawyer. We couldn't hold him much longer without booking him. - Gentlemen, do you realize the ramifications of all this if we go public? - Four of his recent policyholders are dead. Mr. Peersgail's profoundly litigious attorney is demanding payment on yet another massive check which we cannot without creating a more than actionable offense ourselves refuse to write. That is unless changes are promptly brought. Now call me a cynic, but I'd say we're light years beyond this thing hitting the fan. (dramatic music) - The ring too. - Come on, man. - On the tray. - Hello. Danny, darling what a pleasant surprise in an otherwise tedious day. - Merci, what can I do for you? - Well, we heard Sister Grady was home from the hospital. - I'll see she gets these. - Actually we were hoping to deliver these ourselves. You know, there's nothing like seeing a person's face especially when they're opening up something that you picked out for them yourself. - Well, I suppose just for a few minutes. Let's see if I can sneak you in. - So what's this I hear? - I'll only be gone a few days, a week tops. McKenzie brief is in Xerox, and the rest I'll handle from the road. - You know the board's meeting next week. Not the optimum time for a potential partner to be out of town. - Trust me you won't even know I'm gone. - Okay, Mayhew, what have we got? - Look five other witnesses plus our own Mr. Peersgail puts him at the scene. But there's no evidence of collusion yet. But I know that's what we're looking at. (soft knocking) - Excuse me, Mr. Finch. Senator's online two are you in. - 20 seconds, okay thanks. What about the other three deaths? - An embolism, choking victim accident on the job. - What kind of accident? - Seven story fall from a construction site. Nobody anywhere around him no witnesses. - No witnesses. - Do you believe this? - I believe in God. I haven't looked in the book, but I trust whatever's there is in better hands than these. - I don't understand why God, if he does exist why he would have given this to my son of all people. - He rather asked for it, you know. - He asked for it. - After Caroline died, I don't think he knew there was a book. But he was angry, angry that God knew what was going to happen and he didn't step in. - What is this some kind of bizarre turnabout? See how it feels. - Not to see how it feels but to understand maybe. - Your honor, we're dealing with a possible serial killer here. - My client has an excellent record, no priors. He poses no flight risk. - Alright enough both of you. I understand the theatrical value of what you're saying, Mr. Finch. There's hardly a preponderance of evidence. See if you can pull things together before I hear this case next week. - Your honor. - The defendant is bond over without bail. - Trust me this is good. - What could possibly be good about this? - Not that I'm buying into this. But as far as you can see do people die on the date in the book? - Every time unless I save them. - You had someone dying on Thursday. - Grady Hopkins. - Believe me when I say that I am terribly sorry, but she'll be dying while you're in here. No direct connection. No evidence for conspiracy. We'll move for dismissal. - She's not gonna die. - What do you mean? It's not as if you can save her from here. - I already did. - I would think given the situation your client will be open to a plea. - I would think you were offering one since you have no case. - Check your calendar, counselor. You see it's only Friday. Sister Grady Hopkins is still very much alive. Interesting. She's also the only one on your client's list who hasn't bought a policy. - You're reaching, Finch. Didn't anybody ever tell you how pathetic that is in a politician? - Leak it. - Although Mr. Hartland's so called blacklist has not been released it is presumed to include names of additional Worthington Life policyholders who are numbered among Mr. Hartland's personal clients. Well, that should soothe the masses. - Nobody's seen these yet. (telephone ringing) - Yes. I'm glad you called. This is taking a lot longer than anticipated. Well, no, no, the retraining order it is in place on Watkins. I just have to review the books for precedent tonight. I do not want Delvichi going in there. Just get a continuance. I'll be back as soon as possible. Right. Bye. - This isn't the only thing you're doing. - Please, Frankie. I know my priorities. - Well, you sacrificed your marriage for your career. Why not your firstborn. (soft music) Danny, you know I didn't give those pictures. - I know. - You didn't think for a minute that I was gonna? - Come on, Frankie, I think I know you better than that. - Are they treating you alright? - More or less, yeah. - Danny, they took your ring. - Yeah. - Danny. What can I do? I feel like most of this is my fault anyway. - This is not your fault don't say that. I could not have done this on my own, and then I had to. Maybe it's just better this way. - No, ma'am, I ain't told nobody else about that book. - What about the person who gave it to you? - It didn't come from no person not like you saying. I'd have thought you'd figured that out. - All I know is come Monday morning I go into that court. I do not want that book or anything about it to enter into this case. - You thinking I was gone bring it up. - As far as I can tell no one knows you exist. No offense Mr. Parks but let's keep it that way. - They waved the jury. - Can they do that? - Can and did. Mr. Peersgail, could you please tell the court who you believe is responsible for your beloved wife's death? - Objection, calls for speculation. - Mr. Peersgail was a witness to the death. - Overruled the witness may answer. - You killed her. You killed her as soon as you pushed her into the street yourself. - No further questions. - The defense calls the court's attention to the defense's exhibits A through F, photographs taken of the incident by another eyewitness Mr. Frances Newhall. (camera clicking) Mr. Peersgail, the defense sympathizes deeply for your loss as well as how difficult this is to observe. But could you please direct your attention to the exhibits? - I can't look at that. - Because it's the truth. Because my client did not push your wife into the street. But indeed saved you from a similar fate yourself. - Asked and answered. - Sustained. - He had no right. If I wanna throw myself in front of a freight train to save my wife it's up to me. - Mr. Peersgail. - You know, I might have been better off if he killed me too. She was all I had in this world. - Mr. Peersgail, who is the beneficiary of the life insurance policy you hold on your late wife? - I am. - Is there any arrangement whatsoever for any of that benefit to be due to my client? - No. - Just one more question, Mr. Peersgail. Has Worthington Life paid on that policy? - Objection. Objection, the defense knows the benefit is on hold pending the outcome of this proceeding. - Withdrawn, your honor. (soft music) - Prosecution calls Ms. Frances Newhall to the stand. - Objection. Ms. Newhall is listed as an eyewitness for the defense because she took the photographs. - And therefore is eligible to be called. - Your pension for tidiness aside, I'm afraid he's right, counselor. Ms. Newhall. - [Bailiff] Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth so help you God. - I don't know. - I do. - This exhibit are these your pictures? - Yes, I took those. - What occasioned you to be present at this most fortuitous photo op. - Well, I always have a camera with me seeing as it's my job and we were having breakfast. - [Finch] You and the defendant? - People eat. - Having breakfast at the same time and restaurant as the defendant's newly signed clients Mr. and Ms. Peersgail moments before Mrs. Peersgail's demise. - Objection, counselor's testifying. - Sustained, is there by any chance a question Mr. Finch? - Had you ever had breakfast at that particular restaurant before that day? Don't look at the defense, Ms. Newhall. Just answer the question. - No, I hadn't planned on eating that day. It's just I was walking by and I saw Danny there, and so I went in and bummed a muffin. - Excuse me, your honor. May I have a word with counsel. - Quickly. (whispering softly) - The prosecution requests a short conference related to this witness. - Your honor. - Denied I have granted you leeway to question her now as it is. - Ms. Newhall, do you live at 315 85th Street? - Objection, relevance. - Just a little latitude, your honor, please. - Alright but get there. - Ms. Newhall. - No, that's where Danny lives. - I'd like you to direct your attention to the officer seated right over here. Now he tell us during the arrest you were seen leaving the apartment carrying a large antique book. - Objection. Their surprise where was this in discovery? - Your honor, I just found out about this now myself. - Defense request an immediate consultation with the witness. - You better get your story straight. - Your honor. - Defense is lucky, Ms. Hartland, I am hungry. Recess granted for 15 minutes. - So what else are you keeping from me? - I didn't think. - No, you didn't. - Don't blame her. I forgot about it too. - In case you didn't realize it, Danny you're on trial for your life. Do you get that, Danny? - Look maybe they won't. - Of course they will. This is the first piece of anything that Finch has unearthed. - I wish I never had that freaking book. - Well, you did have it, Danny. That's a reality so deal with it. - Alright we have to make sure that they don't get it. - You think I want to. - Will you lay off of him. - You stay out of it. - While you're at it lay off of me too. - I'm not on you. - You are constantly on me. You've been on me the moment you met me. The instant that you realize that I have the kind of relationship with your son that you don't. - Frankie. - No, Danny. She wants to hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Well, this is your reality and you deal with it. Right now I don't know I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna do the best thing I can think to do. It may not be the perfect thing. It may not be what you, the mother of all control freaks, would want me to do. But the best thing that I can scramble in my mind and think to do on what three second notice they give you in there. I am gonna do it for him not for you. Because if you've ever been right about anything concerning me it's that I love your son, and I have tried, I really have to deal with it or shove it away or whatever you do with love when you can't imagine. - Frankie, you don't have to. - Why do you think I was late to your wedding? I mean what did you think I was stuck in traffic? I mean I'm not an idiot. I mean I know I could never compete with Caroline. I mean she was so over the top perfect. I'm so completely not. Then I figured now. Now I can get some closure on this and then you get married. I thought I had it. I did. But then you lost her. There it was again, blam. All back again. I don't give a rip what you think about me or how egregiously inappropriate it is for me to raise this at this particular moment in time. Because in all this dancing around we're doing there is one thing I know that is undeniably true I am bone deep, gut ripping cry myself to sleep at night stupid in love with your son, and I am gonna do whatever it takes. Alright whatever it takes to see him through this. (dramatic music) Ms. Newhall, I trust you're familiar with the penalty for perjury? - Yes. - You left the defendant's apartment before he was arrested, before he was even searched. Then when the officers saw you carrying a large antique book. - Objection, testifying again. - Really Mr. Finch. - Tell us about the book, Ms. Newhall. - It's just a book. - Just a book, no notes, additional publications carved out compartments. Anything in this book? - No, just the original unadulterated pages and a cover. That's all. - Where is this book now? - I can't say. - You can't or won't? - The witness is not on trial here? - The witness was seen carrying an item from the apartment which should be entered into evidence. - You're directed to answer Ms. Newhall. - No. - Where is the book? - He didn't hurt any of those people. - [Finch] Ms. Newhall, where's the book? - Those lousy insurance people just don't wanna pay. - Where is the book? - I'm not saying. - [Judge] Answer Ms. Newhall. - I'm gonna take the fifth. - I will hold you in contempt. - Fine. - The witness is in contempt, and is hereby taken into custody, bailiff. (dramatic music) (buzzer ringing) - You haven't been in court. - I suppose I was of more use here. - It always come back to this, doesn't it? - This. - While you're at it you can tell him I could use his help. - You can do that yourself. - That's not what the priest said when I got my divorce. - Sit down please. Ms. Hartland, you're a mother. You'd find a way to forgive your child no matter what. You know that you talked again. - You saying you don't subscribe to the company line. - I know that makes me a heretic in some circles. But I don't pay that much mind. - Is the book secure? - Do you want it to be? - Danny does. But I. It's God's book anyway why doesn't he defend it? Because he doesn't do his own dirty work? - He's never asked a single thing of a soul he hasn't done himself. - I'm sorry, but it's not his son on trial here. - Your son gave 10 years of his own life for me. 21 for Mr. Peersgail. He's God's son alright he is indeed. (buzzer ringing) - Well, it's become a national story. You saw the reports. Oh, no, I'm perfectly capable of keeping the firm clear of this. You don't have to. Oh. So soon. I'm sure Delvichi will rise to the occasion. Yes, I'm sure he'll be an extraordinary asset as partner. Why, yes, I understand. - [Finch] It was a list you say? - Cover to cover, names and dates. - And the title. - Book of Days. - Now Father Leiderman, is it possible that the defendant created this book himself? - Objection, calls for expert testimony. - Sustained. - Let me restate that. In your opinion, did he create the book? - No, sir, I don't believe that he did. - Now you've just told the court that you don't know anything about Daniel Hartland, so how can you be so sure? - It's older than he is. - So, someone hands you a book, throws a little dust on it, and that's how you conclude that's why he didn't make it? - The book is an ancient text that's been handed down for thousands of years. - Is that right? - It was discovered by a slave in Gomorrah when Solomon was king. Names of those living and dates when they die. People thought it was an evil book. They tried to destroy it but never succeeded. Scripture tells us like fire on the mountain they tore parchment from the Garden of Shadows. - Garden of shadows. - The book goes by many names. In Egyptian hieroglyphics it's known as God's list. - So what you're telling the court is that the defendant is in possession of a book written by God? - Now you need to make up your own mind about that. I'm just saying. - Well, we're saying what ET, the tooth fairy, the Loch Ness monster they're all real. - Objection. - Sustained. - I withdraw the question. What we're here for is to find out about a series of deaths. Now isn't it true the defendant came and confessed to you? - He did not. - Then why else would Danny come to you? I mean are you a bibliophile. - No, sir. - Now if the court were to believe that this Book of Days exists and you are an expert in ancient text, then I can understand why he would come seek you out. But as it stands the only reason I can see him seeking you out is for confession. - Your honor, Mr. Finch is badgering the witness. - Mr. Finch, let's wrap this up. - Isn't it true that Daniel Hartland came to your church seeking solace for his crimes? He confessed to you and blamed it on a book that he concocted out of his own imagination. - No. - The truth is, Father Leiderman you can't tell me the truth. - Approach. Counselor, you need to reign it in and wrap it up. - Prosecution is discrediting the one witness who's willing to come forward about what is obviously key evidence. - His credibility is an issue. I mean what about the public safety? I mean we don't even know how extensive the defendant's death list is. - There's no correlation between my client's follow up sheet and the alleged book. - It is evidence and they have a right to hear about it. - Counselors cease and desist. - Your honor, some of these people are on the short list. I mean how many more people have to die before-- - Your honor. - Danny, sit down. - I wanna talk to him. - The state welcomes a chance to question the witness. - He's not a witness. - Chambers. - This is a public hearing. - Now. - If this book exists and if I'm able to deliver it into evidence, I want three assurances. - Danny. - I'm doing this. - Go on. - Ms. Newhall is to be released immediately. - And. - No one other than yourself would be allowed to examine the book, your honor. - The state is entitled. - Must you be so pouncey, Mr. Finch. Sorry Mr. Hartland, but the state would have the right to access anything entered into evidence. - Well, could you restrict that access? Would you supervise it and ensure that nothing is copied and no attention is paid to any names or dates other than those directly pertaining to my clients? - Your honor, I cannot agree to these terms. - It is not your courtroom is it, Mr. Finch. You've been begging me for this Book of Days, and I'm trying to get it for you. The third condition. - I need your word, sir, as an officer of the court that if I am exonerated that book as my personal property would be returned immediately to me. - You're asking me to put a lot of faith in you, Mr. Hartland. I'm sure you can understand why the third condition is not one I can grant not having so much as examined the evidence. I will agree to your first two conditions. As to the third, well, you are gonna have to put a little faith in me. (dramatic music) (soft knocking) Come in. - Wasn't nobody gonna pick up (mumbling) - Thank you both. May I have some privacy please? - Your honor. - Shew, shew, shew, shew. (dramatic music) - So this book if you didn't write it who did? - I'm supposing it was God, sir. - [Finch] God, an elusive scapegoat. - Who else would know? - Let's accept God as a concept just for the moment. So you're saying it's God's fault not yours that your clients are dying on the dates that you listed? - I used to think that, yes. But I'm wondering if it's really anyone's fault. I mean people die. - And people died as you with knowledge and forethought watched it happen? - Yes. - Did you create this book? - No. - Didn't you appoint yourself judge and jury over Walter Reavis, Eugene Bates, Lavinia Cooperton, and Catherine Peersgail? - I didn't know about Mrs. Peersgail. The name in the book was Lawrence. I went there that day to try to save him. - Because your employer uncovered your plot? - There was no plot. - Four people are dead already, Mr. Hartland. There's another one listed for tomorrow. Can you actually look at your client-- - Objection. - Anything else, huh? Can you? - Chambers, Mr. Finch. (dramatic music) I made it abundantly clear the names on that list were to be held in strict confidence. - I said no name. - Oh, save it Finch. There're a dozen clients and their families in there that now know one of them is gonna die tomorrow. - Nobody's gonna die. - That counselor is beside the point. - This is insane. Do any of us actually believe that bizarre alibi has any sort of credence. - You're the one who wanted it in evidence. - Now that it is, Mr. Finch, now that you brought the gallery to critical mass we test it. - You're gonna put the book on trial. - Hartland is in custody and poses no threat. You do whatever you and Mr. Worthington have to to ensure the safety of Ms. Dewitt. If she does not expire tomorrow, we throw the book out. - Well, where do you think we stand now? - I don't rightly know. - This whole thing is so screwed up now. I mean is Sheri Dewitt gonna die tomorrow like the book says? Or because of this mess have I put her in a position where somehow they're gonna be able to save her and I'm gonna die instead? - Don't say that. - Frankie, she's 28 years old. That's major life expectancy. If she lives I'll die. - No, Danny, you are not gonna die on me here. Jonah, tell him. - It's the balancing of it. One has gotta die so that the other one can live. - [Amelia] Am I correct that shortly after your wife died, your boss Richard Worthington doubled your quotas? - Actually he more than doubled them beyond anything I had ever been able to sell in the past. He implied that if I failed to meet those quotas, I would be terminated. - Did Mr. Worthington suggest where you might find this new clientele? - Objection. - Overruled. - He said that he didn't care where I found them. Just sell them the policies and push the immediate coverage plan. - Stay with her please. - This is torture you know that? - Waiting. - Knowing. They all keep looking at me. They know I know. If I do anything they start reading a zillion things into it. I mean they're right. 'Cause even if their names aren't up today, they're right around the corner. They don't really wanna know. They think they do but not really. - It's me isn't it? - Whatever makes you think that child? - I woke up this morning, and I... You think there'd be somebody that I should write or call. I've got no family. - Oh Sheri, yes you do. You do now. You've got a sister. - Mr. Worthington, these policies that my client sold did you have the right to approve or reject them? - Yes, but. - Yourself personally approved these? - Yes, I did although-- - You had every opportunity after receiving medical history to have rejected these policies. Yet you found it perfectly acceptable to put your signature on them and to take each person's check. Is that not so? - That woman needs help. - [Amelia] Did you approve Sheri Dewitt? - Yes, I did. - Walter Reavis. - Yes, I did. - Danny. Danny help. - Just get her to a hospital. - Catherine Peersgail where are you going? - Order. Restrain that man. You don't anywhere near her. - No, I've gotta go with her. - Order. - [Medic] Okay, what do we got? - Sheri Dewitt, eight months sudden onsite contractions two minutes apart 10 centimeters, O positive. - I have to push. - You don't understand. - Perhaps you can explain it to me. - It is her or me. - Worthington is paying on a policy either way. - This isn't about paying on some who cares policy. This is your life. - And Sheri Dewitt's. - You are not going. - This is not your decision. - It is mine and I say you're gonna stay. Your propensity for playing God aside Mr. Hartland, these chips are gonna fall where they may. - I can't do this. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can push. Come on now push. - Promise me you'll take care of my baby. - [Medic] I need you Sheri now. - Promise me. - I promise, I promise. Now push. - Here we go. That's the head. Again. - I can't. - Yes, you can push. - You're doing fine one more big one. - Push darling push. (baby crying) - You have a lovely baby girl. - Look what you did. - She's coding. - I'll get the paddles hold the baby. - Jesus. Oh, God. - Danny. - She's gone. I know it. - I don't have to tell any of you what an unusual, emotionally charged case this has been. It falls to me though as a judge to look beyond the passions of the matter and rule on what facts have come into evidence. Concerning Sheri Dewitt's death I'm satisfied her physician did everything in his power to save her. It's evident that not unlike the defendant's other deceased clients Ms. Dewitt's demise was beyond the capacity of either the defendant to cause or his accusers to prevent. Why it simply seems that it was just her time. The defendant will please rise. It was abundantly clear to me that you are not guilty of the charges leveled against you. (crowd cheering) I cannot say that I believe in your Book of Days, but I can see that you do and that your actions were predicated on providing for the best interest of your clients. Mr. Hartland, you will be dismissed at the conclusion of these proceedings. (crowd applauding) (crowd cheering) Worthington Life is ordered to make payment today on all contracted death benefits due to their respective beneficiaries. - Your honor what about the book? I mean you can't give it back to him. - Yes, I can Mr. Finch that's what's being a judge is about. I get to decide. That said however it strikes me that to give the book back to you Mr. Hartland would not be entirely in your own best interest. - But, your honor. - You seem like a nice young man to me. I'd like to see you have a nice life. I don't think that's something that's gonna happen as long as that book is in your possession. Therefore, I am ordering the book be transported tomorrow to the national archives to be sealed there for a period of 200 years. - How do I know it's gonna get there alright? - Obviously both you and your former employer have reasons for this concern. That's why you as well as representatives from Worthington Life will be permitted to accompany the book on its journey and to oversee its security. Court is adjourned. (gavel banging) (soft music) - Thank you. - She did such a good job that Sheri. - She did. - I thought if you don't mind I was thinking about naming her Caroline. - Yeah. - I'd like that. - Oh, Danny, when you gave me 10 years of your own sweet life. - Grady, I didn't know. - Will you hush now. Everything works out for the best. I've got 10 more years to give this little girl and that's because of you. - 10 years isn't nearly enough. - 10 years is exactly enough. I made a promise to her mother that I would take care of her, and I intend to keep that promise. I'd just like to do it with you and Frankie. Everything is precisely as it should be. You're gonna make a wonderful home for her, huh? (plane engine roaring) - Jonah. You've come to see me off. - No, son. I came to do it for you. - I really appreciate that but I have to. - Don't argue with me about it. It's the way it's gonna be. - But Jonah I have to. - Last time I didn't see to it. But I can see to it today. - But the judge. - I already talked to the judge and we both agreed on it. As long as you got that book, all you'll be thinking on is death. Gotta think on life, boy more than you know. - Give it to him, Danny. Let it go. - But, Frankie. - Just open your hands. (soft music) - Promise me you won't let it out of your sight. - No, sir. No indeed. - Morning, Ms. Newhall. - Hello. - And just who is this? - This is Jonah. He's taking the book in my place. - I'll take the book. Shall we, we have a plane to catch. - Yes. Mr. Worthington, I think it would be better if you wait to get on the plane. - Oh, I could wait. I could wait. - [Jonah] I'd straighten up that tie of yours, Mr. Worthington. We're about to have ourselves a little meeting. (soft music) - What? - Nothing. - I think I know you better than that. - Yeah. I guess you do. I never saw the Book of Days after that. But then I never needed to. It was hard to think of Jonah going down with that doomed plane and stepping into eternity with Worthington. But Grady convinced me. Jonah had seen Worthington's date in the book. He knew what he was doing. It was his great and glorious something. That moment of truth he wanted so much to believe he could carry out. Jonah wasn't slated to go for 30 some years, and in taking my place he gave those years back to me. To me and to Frankie and to Caroline.
