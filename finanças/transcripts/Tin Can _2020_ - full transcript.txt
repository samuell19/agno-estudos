♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪♪ Hey, I'm hoping I'll see you later today. I know I won't but, I thought maybe I could convince you. It's all starting to really sink in now that I'm doing this. It's scary you know? It's all good, I just wanted to say see ya later. Ok. Ok. (Voice on speaker) -Announced it would be taking new initiatives to contain the coral outbreak in Eastern Canada. Some fear, it would mean more travel bans spot checks and curfews in the coming weeks. Since its May discovery the fungal infection had quickly swept across the Maritime provinces, and Quebec. Although no related deaths have been confirmed researches are racing to assess the full risks associated with the pathogen. Now, one in twenty-five Canadians is living with the untreatable disease. For many the more alarming statistic is that only a fraction of those infected are receiving medical care. Health Canada blames it on a shortage of medical professionals in the workforce and the rising cost of private clinics. - Fret. - What's happening? It worked, the coating. The samples won't bond. Really? I checked three times, ran it through the sim. The numbers are tight, the other samples too. You did it. We can contain this thing. We're gonna do more than that. Ah... Listen uhm... they're talking about moving the kids. - To where? - The Vault. Quarantine? That's a prison, they can't do that. This has to buy us some time. Yeah. We just don't have the leverage we used to since he left. It's a good thing you're still here. Doctor Greyl! Hi Michael. And hi to you too. Who's that? She's a robot, she doesn't talk. Right, of course. So how are you feeling today? Only my fingers hurt don't touch them. I won't, don't worry. Where's Jenny and Dan? Jenny's asleep and Dan had to go away. Can I come out now? Soon, I promise. Tomorrow. (Laughs) (Voice on speaker) - Vase time heals all. Hi, John was scheduled for today. Can you tell me if he's gone in yet? He was hoping you'd come. Sick or old? Sick. Well then you're better off without him. It only takes the bad ones. Final judgement. Fret? He went under a few hours ago. Really? Listen, did you hear that? The last bell does toll. (Sound of bell) Going up. Uhm. No thanks. Alright then. (Noise coming from upstairs) (Knocking sound) (Sound of door locking) (Sound of metal on glass) (Hyperventilating) (Coughing) (Coughing) (Voice on speaker) - Welcome back. Welcome back. Welcome back. (Sound of alarm) (Incomprehensible word from speaker) (Hyperventilating) (Loud noise) (Shaking noise) (Coughing) (Coughing) (Big inhale) (Coughing) No. No. No. Oh no. I don't know what the f... No. (Coughing) Help. (Knocking sound) Let me out. Help. (Knocking sound) Where was I? (Sound from outside) Let me out! (Knocking sound) Hello? (Knocking sound) (Screaming) - Let me out! (Hyperventilating) (Unbuckling sound) (Breathing fast) Hey. Help me! I need to get out of here before it's too late. Do you hear me? (Screaming) Let me out!!! (Crying) (Hyperventilating) Alright. Ok, ok, ok, ok. (John) - Fret? Oh shit. (John) - Fret. John? Yeah I'm here. Are you ok? What is going on? Get me out of here. John? I can't, I'm in the same boat. Oh no no no no no. This is not happening. We need to tell someone before they start the process. Too late for that. What? I'm just saying it might be too late. No there's no way that I'm doing this. I think we may already have. (Voice on speaker) - Welcome back. What? No, no. I was just... I've been pumped full of the antifreeze. I can tell that much. Is your body numb? Better than crystalized I suppose. Oh no no no no... Let me just let me out of here! I don't know what to say... Why would someone do this? It wasn't voluntary? I'd never, you know that. I was ah... I think I was jumped? I can't remember. They say that the dormancy can affect your prefrontal cortex. Maybe you just don't remember self-committing? How long have we been here? I'm wondering that myself. Have you spoken to anyone? No, I-I woke up when I heard your voice. How do we open these things? As far as I'm aware they're supposed to self-open upon our revival. (Knocking sound) Hey! Help! At least we're together. Hey! Something was just in here and now there's a yellow bar. What does that mean? I'm not sure. You're not sure? You don't remember building it? I was blood engineer so I don't know anything about the about the mechanics in here. (Coughing) How is it? Depends on which one of us you ask. I'm sure "The Coral" would tell you things are going great. I thought it couldn't further develop under the temperature? That's what the simulation said. Well, this is what I've been saying. Preservation is a fantasy. It wasn't close to ready. Well we're here, aren't we Fret? We're in a tomb, John. That's where we are. I managed to detach the catheter. You just have to twist the tube until the seal breaks. John? I'm good. I'll wait for the pros take them off. They're on for a reason. Sorry this happened to you. I wanted to help. I missed you, too. (Whistling) (Whistling) (John) - Did you hear that? (Whistling) Hey. Is someone there? (Whistling) Let me out! There's been a mistake! (Whistling) Hello? (Sound of bubbling water) Okay. (Spitting sound) (John) - Fret? What is it? There's an air feed coming from a panel by the ceiling I think it's a vent. Good. Can you get it open? (Older guy) - Use the shit hose! What? (Whistling) (Whistling) (Whistling) (Whistling) (Whistling) (Whistling) (Whistling) (Whistling) (Whistling louder) I got it off. (John) -You did? Is it an opening? What do you see? Fret? Hey, neighbour! Hey. How long have you been awake? It's been a while now but please, pretend I'm not here. I'm enjoying the show. Are we still at Vase? (Laughs) Have you spoken to anyone? Any doctors? (Laughs) I need to know what's going on. We are running out of time. Time? After all this, that's what you're worried about? Cheer up! Today is the first day of a brand new life. Not everyone gets to be born twice. (John) -Fret, can you see anything out there? There are other tanks. Three, from what I can tell. But I don't recognize the space, it looks industrial. (John) - The Vault? Yeah, thumper over here doesn't say much. But the guy across from me, he's been snoring the whole time. Still kicking at least. (Kicking sound) (Uncomprehensible words) There he is. Leave it to the mute to wake him up. (Uncomprehensible words) Cooooool it, pal. (Voice on speaker) - Welcome back. (Fret) -Breathe! There's a bite plate in your mouth you just have to take it out. (Wayne) - I'm freezing. (Fret) - Hey, slow down. (Laughs) Hey, slow down! Easy. We're all in the same situation. (Wayne) - Okay. Did this work? Wayne? It's John. I'm here as well. (Wayne) - Where is here? None of us know, we've all just revived, like you. (Older guy) -Hey neighbour, why don't you open your window and say hi? (Wayne) - What? (Older guy) -Just reach down and yank out that tube coming out of your rear end. (Wayne) - What the hell? (Fest) -If you can detach it you can use the metal fitting to pry open your vent. (Older guy) -Or just wrap it around your neck. (Wayne) -Okay. I got the gag off. Christ almighty this is gross. (John) -Wayne is there any light in there? (Wayne) -Yeah, yeah there's a long blue one. It's hard on the eyes. Chin up, people, rejoice! You're all in for the most sublime awakening. Well, most of you. Don't worry, I'll put in a good word. (Wayne) -Who says you're getting out first? (Older guy) - First up, first out. (Wayne) -No, it's a triage system whoever of us is in the most need of attention... Okay, let's just back up. We don't know where we are or if there's even anyone here at all so we have to manage our expectations about being rescued and figure a way out ourselves. (Laughs) (Older guy) -The woman next to me woke up before I did. Nice lady. The math wiz who worked out this whole thing. So she tells me. - Sophie? - Yeah, Sophie. They just wheeled her outta here while you people were still snoozin'. I figure that makes me next. Who wheeled her out? Shining angels. Now, I don't know how far she got. She was in rough shape covered in that hellish depravity. I'm quite sure she's been destroyed. (Wayne) - What was that? No one's getting destroyed. (Wayne) -There's gotta be a vaccine or something by now, right? How long have we been in here? (John) -I'm guessing a few years. It can't be more than a couple of weeks we'd all have muscle atrophy. Let's be realistic. This thing was never going to work long-term. (Laughs) (Older guy) -You kids really are in the dark. Forget about the cure for Coral. We're all in for something better. You'll see. (Sound of alarm) (Laughs) (Older guy) - And here we go. See you all on the other side. (John) - Is somebody there? Hey. Hey! Let me out of here there's been a mistake! Hey. Let me out of here! (Sound of big door opening) (Sound of gas coming out) Oh! That's some heavy jet lag. What about the rest of us? Let us out! (John) - Excuse me! Listen, the antifreeze in our blood is going to destabilize. We need transfusions. (Older guy) -Don't worry Johnny, I'll come back for you. (Whistling) Where are you going? Can you at least tell us something? (Older guy) -Does that come in black? (Whistling) (Wayne) -Who was out there? Were they doctors? I don't know. I couldn't see much, there was just smoke and yellow light. (John) - How was he? He didn't look infected. (Wayne) -How long are they gonna make us wait in here? (John) - Be patient. We just have to trust that they know what's best. (Clock ticking) (Sound of alarm) (John) - Fret. Fret? Anyone home? (Fret) -It's like I'm still sleeping. Memories feel so real. This does not. (John) -I'm 90% sure this is real. The freezer dreams, God nightmares you can't wake up from, they just go on, and on, and on. Wayne, Fret's my associate at Vase. (Laughs) (Wayne) -Great, another person I can thank. Nice work you did here. (John) -Trust me, I had nothing to do with this. Fret was in research. She was our parasitologist working on a Coral fungicide. Fungistatic. Alloy-based repellent. (Wayne) - Let's hope it paid off. It would have. Not just for the people who could afford it. (Wayne) -The strong survive, right? You can't feel guilty about that. (Fret) - Actually, you can. (Wayne) -Hey, the world was on its way out. It's not our fault people didn't plan ahead. (Fret) -Yeah well, those people had to stay behind and clean up the mess. Let's hope there are no hard feelings. (Crying) (Voice on speaker) - Welcome back. Someone will be with you shortly. (John) -I think there's someone else here. (Crying) It's okay, we're all here with you. (Darcy) -God, what is this thing? (John) - Darcy? (Darcy) - John! (Cough) Thank God! Where's Michael? Is Michael here? (John) -I don't, I don't know. I'm sure he is, he's probably just not awake yet. Just breathe, there's an intubation device in your mouth, just pull it out slowly. (Gagging sound) Can you get it? (Wayne) -Try not to hang yourself with it like I did. (Darcy) - I got it. Fret? Is that you? Michael went under? What about his treatment? (Darcy) -They shut it down. We were out of options. There was no other choice. Well, we need to find him. (Darcy) - John? Has it worked? (Wayne) -Yeah, this isn't exactly what we signed up for! (John) -Just, just be patient. We'll all be fine. (Screams in the distant) Listen. (Screams in the distant) (John) - Jesus! Is that? (Screams in the distant) (Wayne) -Doesn't sound like we're gonna be fine. (Screams) (Screams) (Kicking sound) (Coughing) (John) - Fret, what happened? Fret, what happened? Are you ok? Are you ok? Ahhhhhhh! (John) - Fret? Hello? (Wayne) -Gettin' outta here. I ain't dyin' in this fuckin', I'm gettin' outta here. I wanna go back to L.A. (Darcy) -Who is it? Is it Michael? (Crying) (Fret) - Hey... Hey! (Crying) Hey! I can help you! You just have to let me out! There's a latch at the base. (Crying) (Crying) (Crying) (Crying) (Crying) (Sound of door closing) (Darcy) - We're gonna be ok? (John) - Oh shit. (Darcy) - John? Can you hear me? (John) - Ah, God. (Spraying sound) (Darcy) - Fret? Who was it? Fret? (John) -For heaven's sake tell us something! (Fret) -Darcy, it wasn't Michael. (Darcy) - Thank you. (Wayne) - Who was it? A woman. She was afflicted. I think they put her down. (Wayne) - What? What do you mean? How bad was she? The point of this thing was to get fixed! (John) - Hey, hey. It's possible they were giving her blood. They put her into a shaft in the wall and then... It wasn't a transfusion. (Wayne) - That sounds nice! (John) -Okay, let's all just stay calm. (Wayne) -Calm? I paid a fucking arm to get this God forsaken seaweed shit off me. Not to be crushed in some God damned trash compactor! It's not marine coral. (Wayne) -I don't care what it is! Alright? I'm not letting it suck the life outta me. That's not the way I'm dying. (Darcy) -It doesn't kill you. That's not how it works. It changes you. (Wayne) -I think I got that much. (Darcy) -We don't even know what it is but it acts like a slime mold. It can live freely as a single cell or combine to form multicellular colonial structure. The individual spores they're high in mass. It's why they mostly spread through direct contact. And once they do they germinate and bond to the epidermis. Then it spreads. It spreads until it covers most of your body. Stage three things slow down a bit, as it digs deeper siphons off the blood for its own use and forms a casing over the body. Then, stage four, it starts to change you on the inside and the suffering, it becomes your core. (Wayne) - Changes you into what? You've seen this? (Darcy) -Everything fell apart. There was no hope. So Michael and I slept. (Wayne) - Cool. (Laughs) So we're fucked inside and out. Michael was making progress, it was working. (Darcy) - You weren't there. (John) -Hey. We got him this far. (Darcy) -Then where is he, John? Where is he? He's right. Michael is here and we'll find him. (Struggling sound) (Kicking sound) (Struggling sound) (Kicking sound) (Struggling sound) (John) - Don't hurt yourself, these things were made to endure. (Fret) -Well not all of us are happy to just sit here and wait it out. (John) - I wanna be with you. (Fest) - John. We had a good start I I've just never been good at finishing things. It's not one of my strengths. (Fret) -Pretty good at feeling sorry for yourself. (John) -No I'm just in love with a workaholic. Someone who'd rather spend time with a disease than her husband. (Fret) - What's the difference? And you're not my husband. (John) - We belong together. Fret give me another chance. I made a mistake. (Fret) - Nobody's perfect. (Kicking sound) Ow! Fuck. Ahhhhhh! (John) - I am sorry. (Fret) - Yeah, me too. (John) -Anyhow you won't have to deal with me much longer. You don't get off that easy. John? John? Fuck. Fuck! (Loud noise) (Kicking sound) (Kicking sound) (Screaming) (Wayne) - You did it, didn't you? Please tell me that was a good explosion. (Fret) - Hold on, I'm coming. (John) -Did you get out? (Fret) -They're here. I wanna speak to whoever's in charge! (Sound of gas being released) Ahhhhhh! (John) - Fret? What about me? (Drilling sounds) (Screaming) (Drilling sounds) (Voice on speaker) - Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. (Wayne) - Who's next huh? (Darcy) -Wayne, can you see what's happening? No. (John) -Is it too much to ask to get a little air in here? Listen, the woman you took, we're together, you understand? (Darcy) -Please! I just want to know if my boy is ok! I'll do whatever you want. Please! (Darcy) - Who is it? (Darcy) - Michael! (Boy has difficulty breathing) (Darcy) -Please! Somebody help him! Please! Please, he's just a boy! Michael! Please! (Spraying sound) Michael, it's ok. It's ok. Just do whatever they say, ok? Michael? (Sound of door closing) Michael! (Screams) No! What have you done to him? Tell me! (John) -God in heaven. Hey he's ok. (Darcy) - If you hurt him... (John) -Hey, listen... He's ok. They've taken him into the next room. He's going to be fine. My vent is open I saw him. He's fine. It's just the antifreeze. He's a little disoriented but he looks good. Darcy? He's fine. (Voice on speaker) - Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. Greeting. (Darcy) -Was he still... How bad was it? (John) -Ah, I didn't see it clearly but he was ok. (Darcy) - Yeah? (Wayne) - Which light? (John) - Ah, light? (Wayne) - Blue or yellow? The lights in his vase. They were yellow when the Whistler got out that's what Fret said. We all heard what happened to him. (John) -It doesn't necessarily mean... (Wayne) - All that screaming? Mine in here are blue. That must mean something (Coughs) Maybe they'll help me like Darcy's son. Yellows a warning colour, right? If the Coral damage is beyond repair, you know, not enough person left to save you gotta put them down at some point, I get that. (John) -Fret was yellow and I know she's clear. (Darcy) -She said the Whistler wasn't sick either. (Wayne) -Well I'm not that bad, Darcy. What do you have? (Darcy) -Blue? I can't tell anymore. (Wayne) -You're not sick are you? Ok, what about the kid then? They helped him. What was he? (Darcy) -John? (Wayne) - John! (John) - I, ah... I didn't get... (John gagging sound) (Wayne) -Well, we all know you're not so hot in there, buddy, no of fence. What's your colour? (Darcy) - Leave him alone. (Wayne) -Let's just settle this. Come on John, what is it? Give us your fucking colour! (John) - I don't know! I don't have one? (Coughs) I can't see a fucking thing! I mean... (Wayne) -I thought you opened your vent. (Darcy) - John, tell him. Tell him you saw Michael. (Wayne laughing) (Darcy) - What? (Wayne) - He didn't see shit. (Wayne) -He's just a corpse in there like your little boy. (Darcy) -No! John! John, tell him! (John) - I'm sorry. I just, ah... I wanted to- (Darcy) - No. Reassure you that- (Darcy) - No! Why do I believe anything you say? Darcy! (Darcy) - Everything I did. We're gonna figure this out. (Darcy) -No! Fret would have figured this out, John. She would've saved him. Instead I locked her up in this fucking dungeon. And Michael... Michael too. (Crying) Oh what've I done? What's wrong with me? (Wayne) -Wait. You put Fret in one of these things against her will? (Darcy) -Michael was sick. There were no spots left. John said he could get us in if... I just got Fret down here. (Wayne) -Jesus. Who are you people? If death is coming, it can't be any darker than this hole. (John) - Hello? Fret! Fret! Fret! Please! I was one of the engineers, I know things. Come on, man, say something. Say something! (Robotic sounds) You're speaking right now? (Robotic sounds) What are you? Are you here to help? Fret... Is Fret alive? Have any of the sick been cured? No one? Euthanized? (Robotic sound) I suppose that's your job? And who the fuck are you? This was my program. I brought these people here. That must count for something. If you can't heal me, put me back in. That was the deal. (Struggling sound) Please. I paid everything for this. (Screams) Ahhhhhhh! (John) - You ok? What a loser. Wait. Please. I'm valuable. (John) - Aaaaahhh! Fuck! (Sound of door closing) Who's there? Fret. Is that you? Thank God. Help me. I knew it would be you. You would have saved the whole fucking planet. I just wanted it to be us. You're my girl. (Sound of door closing) (Fret) -It's just so beautiful it's unlike anything on this planet. Each piece is like a perfect society it works together in full co-operation and then even if it gets separated, the cells always find a way to reunite. So I think that we can learn a lot from that. I was gonna ask if you were a cat or dog person, but hey. I'm a slime person. It's funny you say all that actually. The company I'm working with right now is doing research on something like that. - Really? Where? - Vase. Are you serious? Yeah, get it all out your system. As in that life-extension start up? I thought that was like a scam to steal money from rich old people. - Ouch. - So that's real? - Yeah. - Huh. And to be accurate we're actually trying to save rich old people before we steal their money. Starting human trials this year. Oh, well that sounds terrifying. You think so? Freezing yourself in the hopes that whoever inherits the earth is just gonna be kind enough to wake you up and magically fix all your problems? If it works, which... (Laughs) Ok, gotta have a little faith. Ok, so let's say it does work. Then what? You've lost everyone you ever cared about you're a stranger out of time completely alone. I could introduce you to a few clients that would say there are worse things. I mean look at history, right? Mankind's been able to overcome every single obstacle we've faced. Forces of nature, famine, plague. It's a hard road and there've been some dark ages, sure, but humans triumph over everything the world throws at us. This time is no different, just a matter of how long. Why not just skip to the good part? We know the risks and there's still some stuff to iron out, but ultimately we're just trying to help people, right? Yeah, I get that. You come see for yourself, I'll give you a tour. Umm... I don't know. I'll be honest, we could use a slime loving parasitologist. Yeah? You're not gonna lock me up in one of those things are you? Only if you wanna live forever. Ah, no. I'm good, thank you. Come on. (Whistling) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Cough) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Crying) (Hyperventalating) (Big inhale) (Wayne) -Oh, that's so much better. (Breathing deeply) (Laughs) Aaahh... I can't feel my body anymore. (Darcy) - (Crying) I thought there'd be a way out of this. (Darcy) - (Crying) This may be it. Nothing in this world is made to last. I don't know whether I should go, back to sleep or wake up. Who's that? (Voice of child) - Doctor Greyl... Can I come out now?
