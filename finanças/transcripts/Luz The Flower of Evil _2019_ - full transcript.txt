It's impossible that you found this in the woods. The Devil doesn't live in these woods. This may be one of his tricks. What we just heard, it is the Devil's chant. His music. Music... He acts... In the most beautiful ways. He disguises as God or an Angel, and sometimes even of poetry. Nobody knows the Devil better than I do... And I cannot tolerate this. This stays here with me, or else these lands may burn. Hold your hands. I know you all miss her. You aren't the only ones. She was a good woman. She loved you two as if you were her daughters. Mother is the one who loves us, not the one who gave us birth. There is something that should be clear. She isn't gone if she still lives in your memories. Nobody dies from one day to the other. We know whom we love when that somebody changes our life forever, and she did that for all of you. I know that in days like these, she would like you to know she loves you... Remember how much she helped when you couldn't stand one another, when you didn't tolerate each other, and you couldn't see eye to eye. She is part of you all, of these lands and of this house. She never said goodbye... Or farewell. That's why she will always, always be here with us. You my lord, bless this food. Make these lands flourish... Have mercy on us. We only seek to be your servants and helpers. Lead us away from evil, and from the tricks of the Devil. Give peace to these lands and to this family. Show us where Jesus is. Guide us to his kingdom. We are your envoys. Your light, your voice on Earth. Girls... Girls! Today I found something in the woods. - What? - A trace of the Devil. El Señor always says that the Devil doesn't leave a trace, that's why he always chooses fire to get rid of them. Of course not. He was the one who told me. The Devil? No. El Señor. My father. El Señor. And that? This is the trace. Why do you have it in our room? Get it out of here! It scares me. Quiet, Zion! Quiet. Do you want him to hear us? I really don't think this is the Devil at all. If it isn't, what is it then? I don't know. I think there's an angel trapped inside it. An angel? Do you remember the day mother gave us this box? Luz told us that an angel was trapped inside of it. That's why a beautiful sound came out when we turn the crank, because that angel sang for us. And that angel brought us together. What comes out of this, of this angel... Do you know what it is called? Music. Music? Today, father said that word. He said that from this, came the Devil's chant. What does the Devil sound like? I don't know. Just like the box. - Play it once more. No! - Please play it. - No, we need to rest. Just for a while. Play it! You girls are annoying. For a little bit. Do you think we will ever find the real one? It's a matter of faith. How do you think he is? I don't know. Sometimes I feel he will be just like you, and others I think he may be like me. I... Really don't know. I believe he would be like you... Calm. I don't know why I haven't really imagined him. I... I just believe that... When we find him, things will finally be all right, and the tree will finally bloom. Do you know the meaning of light? Light is the communion of all things. The communion of angels and saints, of all shapes and colours. When there is peace, and perfect harmony, light is created. Know why light can't be seen or felt here? Because your hands are empty, just like your hearts. The sky... The sky is opening up and with it, the wrath of the Lord will fall on all of the infidels. I am the only one that has seen God, he has whispered in my ear Yesterday I had a dream. I dreamt that he was nearby, he was walking in this direction. He will arrive soon. I don't expect you to believe in my words, as I know you don't, but believe in the word of the Messiah who will soon arrive. And this way, the tree where I buried my wife will finally flourish, as well as these lands. And all the miracles will take place. That will be our signal. But be careful. Be very careful with whom you speak. Stop asking for things from the tree. We don't have to ask anything from nature. It simply gives. And this tree isn't Luz, if it was, it would have bloomed already. Don't you remember? Remember how happy she was... But this tree isn't her, so stop asking, and don't believe everything El Señor says... je pense qu'il se trompe depuis toujours. Because he is always wrong. I think that after Luz died, truth in this land is gone. How do you know it won't bloom? Zion, The only thing that must grow here is you! No! The only thing that needs to grow here is your faith... I'm going to grow up anyway. It's best not to stare. Remember what El Señor said... "Angels must be left in peace." Don't believe everything he says, angels don't exist, Don Elias. Even that waterfall would be dry, if we didn't believe in something. Those waters have been there longer than they have. How many sins will be there? It's better to believe than to not. They are just women, not angels. Women just like yours. But better. And what makes a women better, Adam? The body. Poor Adam. Bodies are only good for the worms. You must start believing in something. Just look at them. They are angels. They are perfect. They are saints. It's better to let them be. Don't get into trouble. It's better if we go now. Sometimes we have to stop thinking like men. For a long while, the only thing I heard was this: The music of silence... The music of God... Of the Devil... Of Luz, that's no longer here. Luz is in each of us, Each one of us is chased by a different idea of light... An absent memory... Mine was my mother, hers was solitude. That haunts most of us. I'll wait for you... I'll wait for you, Luz. Let it go. Girls! Zion! - Let them go! Zion! You understand? No... listen! Stay for a while. Laila! Laila! Laila! Listen! Laila! Listen! Listen! I say once more, let it go! He's arrived. - Do you think it's really him? - I hope so. Zion! Zion! Zion! No! Zion! Zion! Come back! Zion! Zion! Come back! Let go. Now! - Leave me. He is my son! - No! Yes, he is! I gave birth to him! I gave birth to him! From now on his name is Jesus! Leave him alone now! Leave me alone. He is no longer your son! He is no longer your son! I was the moon and I knew it. A light in the sky. The one that never found herself through daylight, but lived at night. But hope was dying inside of me through the endless nights, I finally understood as I finally understood... that I was not like the others. Sometimes I was light... And other times I was darkness. Sometimes I felt like myself... and others... others' pain spoke through me. I'm still young and naive, but my body cannot handle more sorrow. And my soul... And my soul cannot take one more lie! Go away! I don't want you near my land! Silence is just a breeze. It happens and it leaves a mark, creating a new breath. We have all been wolves, some lonelier than others, some more docile, and others more frivolous. But we are brothers and we must stay together. I am human, of flesh and bone. I accept my mistakes, the same way that I help others surpass theirs. I've been wrong. I've brought disgrace and death to these lands. But you can calm down now. Our Messiah is here to save us. A new life will begin for all of us, filled with more hope, wealth, absolution and light! Señor... Are you sure he is the one? Yes And you all know what to do. We must take care of him. Papa, The previous Jesus asked me to let him go. He wanted to see his mother. The only mother of God is the Virgin. The last one was an impostor, a demon. If you had released him, this house would have been turned to ash. But I saw him trembling in the cold, and I think that's why he died. How did you think of something like that? Jesus is not weak He would never die of cold. I was wrong, and brought an angel from Hell. Hell burns, so it's natural that he froze in these cold lands. I've always liked your name. Although I hear it day and night... Zion! You don't have to question Jesus. Let him speak through his actions. You are too young to understand God. God is understood with time, through the passing of years. Just as you understand Luz now that she's gone... Everything is a process and takes time. Everything that has to do with God is complicated. Today we are gathered in front of this lake... because water is acquittal. Water washes away our guilt, our mistakes, our body and soul. Water is birth, but also the rebirth. Today sets the start of a new beginning for these lands, a new beginning guided by the hands of Jesus, our Redeemer. It's time to baptise this docile child. It's time that these turbid waters become pure and clean with the help of his mercy. But today is not only a special day for us. Today, 23 years ago, one of our three angels was reborn. Every day you seem to get older, Laila. You get more responsibilities with me and with these lands. But not every day is for obligations. Days like today are special. What would you like for today, that is your day? This thing you want is simply a shell. Evil is this that is inside. The most beautiful and pure things sometimes have the Devil inside. Do you like it? I'll give you this in exchange for something. If you press here... - May I? - Wait! If you press here, it also serves to record your voice, and you can hear it anytime. Happy birthday! Happy birthday. And what do you want from me? Your silence! I want you to use this tool as a badge of good. Learn how to hear, to listen carefully before speaking. Silence... Will connect you even more with nature. When you cannot stand so much beauty, or so much chaos, speak to yourself. Silence will split your life in two, but for good. Happy Birthday, Laila. Thank you. May I? Happy Birthday./i> - Uma... - What? Do you really think that the Devil lives inside? Inside of who? Shut up! No, not inside somebody. Inside the device. No. No! If the Devil exists, He wouldn't live inside something that small. If God is that small, the Devil also could be. Stop asking questions. Laila? She wasn't with you, Señor? I have not seen her today. She left very early. Was she carrying her gift? She never releases it. Did she leave for the woods? Haven't I told you not to go to the woods at night? It's probably the Devil's shelter. Uma, come with me! Zion, you'll take care of Jesus! I'm not too young? For everything comes a time. Don't let anybody get close to him. Uma! Let's go! Yes, sir! Water... is the blood of the earth. There can't be blood without veins... Let's go. Elias, move. Goodness cannot exist... Angels do not bleed. Blood is only of men. Without evil... Go on! Search! She is close... very close... The Devil is very close. I can smell his odour. I have dreamt of this odour all of my life. Let's go, but be careful. Here it is... It's the Devil! I told you, Señor. Elias, drop the gun Drop the gun, I say! - Drop it! - It's our chance to kill him. - She's an angel. - She's no angel. She's my daughter, you prick! Drop the gun! - Even you have told us... - Drop it! The Devil has a million disguises. He disguises as God or an angel, and sometimes even of poetry. How can you be so blind? If you shoot, you will live forever cursed in these woods. - I don't care, but the Devil will die tonight. - Drop the gun! No... - Wake up, you prick! Are you all right? If you are God, why are you cold? God cannot feel cold. - Wake up! - I cannot lose this chance. - It's my girl. - The Devil will die... he will... Laila, you promised me. Remember? It's better to think before you speak. Silence will split your life in two. Silence is better than death itself. Jesus, calm down. Jesus, Jesus, how can I know if someday I'll see the Devil? Tell me, please! Tell me how? How? You tricked me! I told you that music was of the Devil! Where did you get this tape? From where? Laila! Laila! Laila, are you all right? Calm down. Take a breath. Ask Jesus for forgiveness. Pay him with devotion and silence. Pay him with your tears. Learn how to read nature. Learn from your mistakes. And that? It's nothing. It was just a branch. Liar! Nature does not cause pain. Only humans do. It's never too late to understand that not everything in life is a matter of faith. Neither to bring light There's no need for the sun, nor warmth. All of nature lives within you... In your silence... In your amazement... In your memories. We all are just as a tree, willing to give without expecting something in return. But we all have lost some branches and we are still standing, giving shelter regardless of our wounds. The bigger the tree, the stronger the roots. The trunk grows towards the sky, while its roots grow down, heading to Hell, towards the obscure and the unknown. We all are good and evil, but we carry on. Uma! Uma! Uma what happened? Uma! Uma... Help me! Help me, please! Uma! Breathe, breathe. Help! She will be all right, I can see it in her eyes. Go take a rest. Go to your room. Let her rest, too. I will be in charge and I will let you know if something comes up. Do you think that what happened to Uma was magic or a miracle? I don't know. Maybe a miracle. Maybe God already began to act. Maybe he was the one who made her feel those things in the forest. You are right. Do you think that she and Adam can reach something? - I don't think Uma is ready. - For what? To suffer. Suffer? Remember how much your mum suffered because of El Señor in the beginning? Zion, you were very young. I bet you don't remember and that was only in the beginning. Later on, they were happy and that was what you witnessed. But Uma told me everything. - El Señor beat her. - And? In life, everything that's good comes with a price. And as I said, that was only in the beginning. Look at me. We all have a demon inside that we have to tame. So do you think it would be good if they see each other again? I don't know. I only want Uma to be happy. But she is sick. They won't be able to see each other in the woods as they planned. I don't think that will make her happy. Soon we will see Luz.. Her light... God... You live inside every one of us. Regardless of the evil things we cause... You live in our blood... In our own darkness. Please accept our mistakes... Our guilt... Forgive us. We are naive and innocent. Wash away our sins... Guide us with your light... Give us strength... To comprehend you... To understand you... To learn to accept you... God, please forgive us... It's freezing. It looks as if it will rain. The rain is God's tears, and God not only punishes with the weather but also with painful deaths... to sinners. I don't want more. Señor, thank you for the invitation but I have to go now. - Goodnight ladies. - Goodnight. Adam... Aren't you forgetting something? Coming... Coming... What's the scandal? Uma! Come, stand up. Go ahead... Kill him! Killing God is the first step towards faith. We kill him every day. Since you arrived, everything here is in disgrace and misfortune. Because you are not God, you are the Devil! No, no, he isn't the Devil. Look closer. How much time has passed and he hasn't eaten a single bite? How much time has passed and he hasn't cried? One of the easiest things in life is to confuse good with evil. One disguises as the other, mais I'un n'existe pas sans I'autre. God and the Devil co-exist! They cohabitate... Uma... Uma... Calm down... Calm down. Just as you three do in that room. In the beginning everything is chaos. But afterwards, peace reigns, as well as tranquility. Laila, calm her down. Take her with you. Uma needs forgiveness. She needs to wash away her sins. Zion, you come with me. Calm down, calm down. Come on. Everything will be fine, Uma. Stop! Here. All of my life... Many years waiting for this... It's here, I am sure. It's where the miracles will take place. My dreams... The compass... The stars... All led me to this direction Yes, I am sure. It's here. Give him to me. Come! Wait! Come here... Aim... Kill him Show me that you can also kill. God not only creates. He kills, too. He also destroys. Aim at him. Kill him! Can't you do it? God is no coward! Do you want to see what the real God would do? Nights like this is when I miss Luz the most. Do you remember everything she knew about the stars? Yes! She always told us that if we saw a shooting star, "We could wish upon a star." And you know what I would wish for? No. That your father stop lying to us all, and finally tell us the truth of whom those kids are. Uma... Uma! Let's go, Paloma. À I'aide, mon ventre! Help me... It's my stomach... Help me... Help me! my stomach! Uma, look at me! That's it. Good job. Here we are Give me a towel, please. Calm down... Breathe... Uma, it will all pass. She'll be fine. Help me! Help me! My stomach... Uma, calm down! My stomach! - My stomach hurts... - What's happening? It's a newborn... Traitors! All of you are sinners! Now leave! Now! Leave! Now! - Go away! - Help me! You, too! Get out of my sight! Out! No... This is impossible... Uma! This child cannot fit there. This child... This is the child of the Devil, the Devil's son! It's all my fault! It's all my fault! I am the only sinner in here. The Devil was looking for me. I wanted to have God inside of me, So I ate some pages of The Book. What have you done! What have you done? This was not the death that I asked you for. The death of an animal is different from the death of a human being. Have mercy... Have pity... She was an angel. She was a child of God. A woman of good that was wrong. Why? Why? Señor, The town and I don't know if we still believe in miracles. We haven't seen one yet. So if you haven't seen one, how do you know they don't exist? Not all miracles have to be good, Elias. You are right, Señor. But two years ago, Miss Luz died, and we buried her there on the top of that mountain, near a tree that never bloomed. Since then, you have brought five children, claiming each of them was Jesus, and that he will wash away our sins. And I still feel the weight of them. You told us that the tree would bloom, and as you have seen, not a single leaf has fallen from it.. All my efforts have been in vain. Maybe God doesn't want to come to these lands? Well, I don't know if God wanted to come to these lands or not. But the Devil did come, and is there in your home, chained down. The wrath of God is greater than the Devil's rage! It is uncontrollable. But only I have seen God! He has whispered in my ear: I ain't what I say I am.. Stop asking for things from the tree! We don't have to ask anything from nature, It simply gives. All I am is a false prophet! And don't believe everything that El Señor says, because he is always wrong. We all have a certain demon inside that we have to tame. I need to be reborn from the ashes! I think that after Luz died, truth in this land is gone. It's the only way out! Water no longer cleanses my sins... Everything that has to do with God is complicated. Perhaps fire will! El Señor says that the Devil doesn't leave a trace. That's why he always chooses fire to get rid of them. Papa? Papa? Papa! Papa! Calm down! He won't come back! Papa! Please help! Zion! The keys! Zion! Let's go. It's here, I am sure. It's here where the miracles will take place My dreams... the compass and stars have marked this spot! A miracle! Please forgive us! Forgive my father. You are free Jesus. You are free! Go away! Look at all the damage you have caused. Go away! Go away! Get out! You are stronger than what we can endure. I said, go! Through the passing of time. I understood that what happened here was not a coincidence. I learned to live with nature, and nature with me. Sometimes I stop and wonder, that what my father did, had sense and a purpose after all. I wish that someday, I could see the tree bloom. It would answer many of my questions. By letting go of Jesus, I understand the true meaning of God. He will always live within me... In my memories... In my soul... In our woods... In my blood... Just like my mother. Miracles do exist. But I'm not chasing them anymore. We were too blind to see. And even though my family is seperated and torn apart, it's at a distance that we appreciate nature and its wonders. And it's better to be together by a soulful bond than separated being together. When there is harmony, there's light, and everything blooms.
