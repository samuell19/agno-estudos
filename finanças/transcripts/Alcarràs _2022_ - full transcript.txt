Three, two, one... Lift-off! We're too close to the sun! Give me my glasses! We're too close to the sun! I can see an alien! Here! The battery! Careful, Iris. Here. Thanks. Give me the can! Quickly, quickly! We need petrol! Petrol! Petrol! Quickly! Petrol! We've run out of petrol. There's a tunnel! Keep quiet. Not a sound or they'll see us and, bang! Meteor! Get out, kids! Mariona! Mariona! Mariona! There's a crane at the reservoir. A crane? - Yes, a massive crane. But, why? Dad? Dad? Where are they, Mariona? I don't know. Dad? Dad! Mum! Dad! Mum! Mum, they took the car. - Auntie Dolors! Mum, can you take me to town, please? Mum, they took the car from the reservoir. I'm sorry. Sit down. We can't find it if it's not here... There's nothing here. You've turned it all upside down. Hey, look at this. They're... bills. I bet we'll find 40 contracts now. This might do it. - No. It's not a contract, Dad. They want a contract that says that the land belongs to you and we don't have one. We just need a signed contract for the land. We've been through this. There is no signed contract. Old Pinyol gave me his word, just like his father to my father. But you're not friends with young Pinyol. He gave me his word. - But not any paper, Dad! You have nothing with young Pinyol! Can't you see what he's doing? They wouldn't kick us out if you'd signed! People didn't sign contracts back then, or Dad would've done it. Do you know what good friends we were? We wouldn't be in this mess, Dad. We signed for the house. We can't live off the house, Dad. Well, Dad... The letter states clearly that we have to leave the land at the end of the summer. End of story. That's it. Like it or not, at the end of the summer, we're out. That's the way it is, Dad. Dad, they took our car away from the reservoir. Fuck! Fucking hell, Dad. - Keep going. Stop. There's one. Stop, stop. Look! Don't you see it? Goddamn it. - Leave Him out of it. Shit. Shit, don't blame me. - Let's get the job done! Look. Fuck me, mate. - Look. They'll eat it all. Come on, Roger. For fuck's sake! Give it here. You need spoon-feeding! Here. - Give me the light. They'll eat all the peaches. They'll be in the house next. Nice one, dear brother-in-law. - Fucking plague. Stop, stop. I'm getting out. Stop. Quimet! He's restless. Hey, brother-in-law, let's get a drink. Hi, boss. - Good morning. Look... Baltazar, will you translate? - What is it? What's up, boss? - I need to get rid of people. This doesn't look good. - I'll take you, you and you. Nobody else will come back. Baltazar, there's no work! That's the end of it, I can't pay all of you. I'm really sorry, guys. Baltazar, we have to go. I'm really sorry. Let's go. What do we do now? Work harder, damn it. We're working as fast as we can. Work faster. Goddamn it, this is hell. Cisco! Go to another tree. You shouldn't both be on the same one. You left some behind, Uncle. - Bullshit. Uncle. Your dad cracks the whip. Just today. Cisco, who picked this bucket? - Your son. Roger! - Quimet. Quimet? Look who I've brought. What a face. What are you doing here? - Picking. Don't we do the picking? - But so can we, we're good recruits. What's the Pumpkin doing here? Helping. - Did I ask for help? The boy's picking, isn't he? I'll just ask the Blacks to work faster. Roger, bring your sister a bucket. Here, Mariona. Get picking. It stinks of dead rabbit. Maybe you just shit yourself. Hurry up, Mariona. You have two hands, you know? Here. They're beauties, right? They are. Come, let's go. Are you coming? Roger. Have you no shame? They're too small. Are you a novice, or what? All she wanted was some lamb marrow broth. And Auntie... But they killed so many cows, there were none left. Not in Alcarràs, Aitona or Castellserà. Auntie. - Yes, love? Just Daisy the cow? - Yes. She became so poor that she had nothing to eat and do you know what she had to do? She had to go out and beg from the people she had treated so badly before. But people forgave her. They gave her food, otherwise she would have starved. And do you know what they gave her? Not bone marrow. They gave her bread and nuts. And she thought... "Had I known how delicious bread and nuts were, I'd still be Mrs Tornabous." What do you think? Why did they only give her bread and nuts? Because those who helped her were poor too. Roger, faster! Faster, Roger! I'm the boss I'm the boss I'm the boss Now this step. Now turn around. And down. Now the guns. And down again. Arms up. I'm the boss I go like this. I do it like this. Great, Roger, it's looking good. Put them close together, drip irrigation is the key. Is it on right? You see that? After just one month. We need to weed around it because it's in the shade. They're growing fucking great. Know my friend Solde? He uses fertiliser... - No way. Let them grow naturally. It's your dad! You think he was born yesterday, Uncle? - Shut up, he'll kill us. It turned itself on. How did he get up there? Goodness me. Pau? Dad, there are so many buttons but I didn't touch them, promise. What did you do? Damn it! Promise? - Yes. They pressed themselves. It was magic. Disasters follow you around. Damn. Hold on tight, Pau. Are you hurt? - Was it scary? Who left the keys here? Are you okay? Get over here. But, Dad, we had the car here before... You can't play here anymore! Which one of you was up there? What? You could have died, Pau. Come on! - What about the car? The car's gone, don't you see? Iris! Look at these tomatoes, Pinyol. - Lovely. My grandson grew these tomatoes. Completely organic. They're so red. My grandson's really into organic food. You've got quite a few. These tomato plants are loaded. They're really sweet, you'll see. Kids. Kids, bring the onions. There's no need. - Yes. There isn't. - There is. Really. You must try the onions but the figs are the best. The fig tree your grandad planted. - Yes. Your dad loved the figs. Let's go and see it. Another time. But they're perfect today. - They're expecting me for a meeting. Have you spoken to your son about the panels? We've discussed it a bit. - And? Well, we've talked it over, but... Pinyol! What brings you here? Good afternoon, Dolors, Nati. - Hi, Pinyol. I was just speaking to Rogelio about the solar panels. Let me tell you about it. I've thought of a way to help you out, so you don't have to leave the land, your husbands could maintain the solar panels. They're people I trust, so I would like them to work for me. Peaches won't make you money. You'd work less and earn more with this. You'll get your fingers burned. I don't know... - We'll talk to Quimet and Cisco. Let me know, okay? - Okay. Thanks. Bye. - Bye. That girl, yes, no I'm not... I'm not that girl That girl, yes, no I'm not that girl I'm not that girl I'm not that girl I'm not that girl I'm not that girl That you think I am The white dove That dances for you on the water Can you bring me the cream, Mariona? Mariona? - Iris, you give it to her. She's in the bath. You make things difficult, love. Goodness me. I spoke to Gal•la's mum. She's bought the school books, says there are loads. Our students don't need so many. Plus, they went to Abacus instead of the Parents' Association. Of course, they can do that, they both work with solar panels. They can afford it. Mum, Gal•la's parents have booked a villa in Sicily. Roger, did you study today? More books and less planting nonsense. That's what they say... With solar panels... you work less and earn more. Not like you, breaking your back. Don't get me started, Dolors. What's wrong now? - Damn it. Quimet. That doesn't help. - Where are you going? What are you doing? - Sulphating because you can't. Go and study. I'm doing you a favour! - I don't need your favours! You're a wreck. Go home and study. Sulphating is pointless anyway. - Give me that. Stop. - This just fucks everything up! Get out, Cisco. Fucking hell. Shit! I'm so sorry, Salvador. - Don't worry. A couple of days and it will be fine again. The land will have dried, don't worry about it. I'm furious. He's not the first one to leave the water running. The hiding my dad would've given me... Those were other times! Rearing pigs would be easier than raising children. I told him. What can you do? If you have any damage, we'll pay for it. You've got it hard enough already, don't worry about it. The kid did what he could. - Quimet, Salvador! Let's see what they say. We'll do whatever it takes. - What should we do? We have to go to the protest, make a scene. Roger! Coming to the protest? - Of course! We're going to make a scene. We need to stir things up. Go to the supermarket... Ramon, Toni... everyone's uprooting. We can't take much more. I bet Pinyol's already been to see them, he'll end up building a solar empire. Go and unload. - Don't I have to get pallets? Do as I say. Untie them. Panels and panels. - And us? We just give in. Of course. We'll be dazzled by the sun. Bye, guys. I'm going to check my pallets. "Pick, pick." And all we get is a sandwich. It's about making an impact, getting it in all the media. Roger, Cisco! Hurry up. We need to pick them all right away. Only pick the green ones if they're soft. Here, Grandpa. - Right. See? These ones. Here. The good ones are up there. Look at this one. - Yes, that one. They look really good. - Yes. See? You picked it perfectly. Know who planted this tree? Yes, the Pinyols. - That's right. You already told me. - They planted it years ago. They were lucky to have this tree during the war. There was nothing to eat. My parents hid the Pinyols in the basement so they didn't get killed. Because they were landowners. This one too? - Yes. My father was a close friend of the Pinyols. And in return for this favour, they let us farm their land. Grandpa, you've told me that loads of times too. Yes, I might have told you that before. Good afternoon. - Hello. Is Mr Pinyol in? No, he's at work. - When will he be back? Quite late, I think. He has a meeting. We brought figs from the tree his grandad planted. Thank you. - We'll leave them here. Yes. He'll see, they're really good. - I'm sure he'll love them. They're from Rogelio. Give me the stick. I'm going to chop peaches. Our new den will look great. It will be peach-coloured. Password? Can you let me in? It's the car one: "catxiputxi." Look at his teeth! Look! - We can take it to the new den! Let's give it some pills, it's not dead, just hurt! I know where! - We can save it. I know where they are! Grandpa's round ones! Quickly, quickly! The round ones! Is it dead? Yes. Nalawal adjum. "Lagala a...djum." Motherfucker! You're an ace, Uncle! - They usually put it there and pump it from below. But it's better to pump it from above to improve airflow. Oh, right, sure. A mechanic taught me and it's been better ever since. - Dad! Dad! Look at those amazing trucks coming! No! Not our den! That's enough. - Not our den! Enough, damn it! The pallets are for the harvest! Move, Mariona! Damn. Take that! Take that! I'll get you! Attack of the lettuce! - My turn! Rock and roll! Rock and roll! Are you okay, Iris? The juice is really hot. Of course. No, wait... No, it's my turn. Kids! What are you doing? Damn the lot of you! - Let's go, let's go! Wait until I get my hands on you! Get out of there! Run! - Run! Come on! You damn kids! What are you doing here? - Quickly! To hell with you! I'm sick of this shit! Finished, Grandpa. Finished? No way. Clean properly. - I told you, Iris, we're not done. That's for ruining the neighbour's vegetables. What's wrong with her, Grandpa? I don't know. What's wrong, Daisy? Look, Grandpa. You want me to be your handyman? No. To look after the panels. What do you want? A handyman? Peaches or panels, there's no difference. There is. I'm a farmer, not a solar panel operator. You could learn. I don't want to learn about panels at my age. You're still young. What I should have done when we were young is drown you in the reservoir. Goddamn it. - You'd regret that. Listen, I don't want to see you around here again. Get out of here. - This land is mine. It's still mine until the harvest is over. What now? You're done with the car, Dad. The doctor said so! Or what? Want to end up like uncle Pepe? In the canal? If you'd signed a piece of paper, we wouldn't be in this mess. And no more gifts! If you give him more figs, I'll cut the tree down. Dad, take your medicine. Here. Some water. - Down the hatch. Please. I'll force it down him if he won't drink it. If not, you'll have vertigo all week. Come on, Grandpa. Mariona, could you fetch me some hangers? Can't Roger go? He's picking, love. Go on. I'm fanning Grandpa. Dolors? What? Where are my white shirts? - Here in the bathroom. What are you doing? Don't shout, Grandpa's not well. You're filthy! Just them, I'm not. Just like those three brothers from Canyissaire, the dirt ate them up. The dirt ate them up? - That's right. They had a sister who went away to work in Barcelona and they were left alone. That's why the house was so dirty. She always was a bit of a tramp. - A tramp? She was right to leave. They say she was Pinyol's lover. I don't know, that's what they say... If our dad could see this, after what he did for the Pinyols, right Rogelio? During the war? I hope he ends up alone with nobody to work for him. I'd be delighted! He'll manage it, Auntie, because he has money and he'll pay well. Listen, what a mess. Put that down, it was my mum's. I should take Pinyol some dead rabbits. Yes. Not having you as a teacher... Kids, you know... I'll take some of those olives. All teachers are great. - Yes. Are you harvesting? - Yes. Yes. Peaches. That's great. Great. Open. Four kippers for Grandpa too. Yes. I'm not picking this afternoon. - Move the bag, please. You're crushing the produce. Take this. Kids don't want to do anything these days. You'll see when yours grow up. Do you have a container? No. I'll put it in a bag. - Okay. I'll put all four here. - Perfect. How much is it? - Mum, look who's over there. Open the bag. Look who's here. It's Pinyol. I can't believe it. Mum... What are Uncle and Auntie doing with Pinyol? Not a word of this to your father. - Why? Just because, Mariona. - 12.75. Here, Núria. "I wasn't prepared for the event of that day, but... it was relaxing sunny afterwards". It's right. This one's right? Yes. I don't sing for my voice Or the dawn or the new day I sing for my friend Who lost his life for me Who lost his life for me More, go for it! Don't be embarrassed! Can you put some feeling into it? I'm the boss Who's the boss? Who's the boss? Mariona, that's who! Let's cheer Mariona on. - Check out this step, Auntie. Show me! Very good. Oh, my sandal! I need a stick! What's this here? Sugar? Sugar! - Or tomato? Sugar with tomato! - Sugar with tomato? I see a bogey! - I want to get down. It's like a tomato jam. For Quimet. Go on, try it. - Poke it in a bit. That's it. - No! I'll poke it in myself. Go on, then. Here, little lady. Down, down, down. That's uncle Quimet. Look, here's the lid. - No, a little more! Can Teia do it? Let's see. Can you hold on tight? - Hold on tight. Glòria. What? Look. Look what your wife's missing. She won't find this in Barcelona. Time for a photo! Come on, everyone! Hooray. - Quickly! Smile, Dad! Look here. Pere, Pau. Solé! Give me a smile, Dad. Great. Gorgeous. - As always! To good health. - You won't be in the photo! I will in the next one, Auntie. Want a snail? - Yes. What were you saying about Tresona, Auntie? Hang on a minute. Iris, come on. Eat a few snails. I'm doing a snail Ramadan, Mum. Sweetie! They're starving in Africa. Albert from Tresona, who married a girl from Cal Tano. Don't you remember? No. - You've seen him 50 times! Great snails today, Dad. Yes, listen to me. Tresona's daughter married a guy from Bellvís. She was single her whole life. - No! They had loads of children! - All girls. And the boy took it all. How it should be. And she came back here. Because they lost everything in the big freeze. So, he's the one retiring? Yes, his whole family is in Barcelona. Give that here. - I'm not useless! We'll die of thirst! Come on! Mariona, Pumpkin. More snails? They're delicious. He's at the pensioners' hall now. - I don't want more. He's there all day long. You could go and play cards too, right? That's for old people. And what are you? A spring chicken? What nonsense! Grandpa's just a kid! Of course. He's a dandy. - You could still go out to clubs! Clubs? I'll take him clubbing with me. To dance boleros! Take him, he might like it. He could get a Romanian girl, like Pinyol. He must have fun... You're talking nonsense. Absolutely. Shut up and eat. He has no clubbing clothes. He needs to get ready. So we're distant relatives of that Tresona guy? We're second cousins. Right, Rogelio? - Yes. Can't we buy Tresona's land then? Mum, can we jump in the pool? - No, honey, let your food go down. Dad, can we go to the pool? Didn't you hear mum? Darn it. Quimet, can't you buy the land? It's too expensive. As far as I know, we haven't won the lottery yet. We need to harvest. Not buy. How old is Teia, then? - She's three. Pinyol will buy that land. He thinks he's the Sun King. All he needs is that Romanian girl. Well said, Auntie. We should think about this solar panel business... What else can we do? Who wants llonganissa? It looks delicious. I want llonganissa. Pass the llonganissa. - It's well done. It's from Grandpa's garden. She thinks this is the Ramblas. You brute. Thank you, Grandpa. - Not you, Roger. Let's go. The highest ones are best. - Up you go. What are you doing? Come on, Pumpkin! She's escaping! You'll tear my arm off, Quimet! Get him, get him! Cannonball! Quimet, no! Let's get your uncle wet! Yes, yes! Quimet! Stop it, Quimet! Come on now! Someone help me! Help us, Mariona! Mariona! Fancy a dip? Just you wait, Quimet! No way! No! No, no! You're joking! Yes! You stinkers! Look at me, brother-in-law! How about you? You could do with a bath. - I don't want to. Careful, Dad! Leave me out of it! Throw him in! I said no! How about that? You bastard. You bastard! Are you going to town all wet? Coward! Attention, the show is about to start. Please turn off your mobile phones and any other electric "pliances." - Hooray! Bravo! Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen! The most awaited show of the year is here for you today. The magnificent Solés! Walt Disney Pictures presents: Jasmine and Pocahontas! Hooray! Beautiful ladies! Gorgeous girls! Sexy ladies! Roger! Look, it's Mum's blouse! Look! And now, a number dedicated to the grandpa of the family. Bravo, Grandpa! If the Sun were a daily worker It wouldn't rise so early If the marquis had to harvest We would have died of hunger I don't sing for my voice Or the dawn or the new day I sing for my friend Who lost his life for me Who lost his life for me The grandfather has the scythe And uses it to cut the wheat And with the wheat He forms a sheaf And chooses the grain I don't sing for my voice A clear sky or a sea breeze I sing for my land Solid ground Beloved land Solid ground Beloved land Come on, it's getting late. I've seen the unemployed work quicker. What are you doing here? Me? You should be picking. Damn it. Why aren't you harvesting? Why, you... - Wait, Quimet. Hey, hey, hey! - What's going on, Quimet? Get off me! Get the hell out of here. Fuck you, mate! - Quimet, please. I don't want to fight! What are you doing? You've lost it! What are you doing? What are you doing, Dad? Dad! - What are you doing? Please! Dad! - What are you doing? Stop, stop! - Dad, what are you doing? Don't touch me. Let go of me! What are you doing? You idiot! We only came for information. That's all. That's all. Get it then, I don't want to see you here again. You've lost it! - Get lost. Idiot. - Let's go. Are you okay? - Roger! Come on, let's go! Your back's sure going to hurt. This one's much better and it's bigger. But, it won't... Just look. This won't stand up. But if you stick it in hard, like this, and then put another stick in here... The car was cooler. Pau, Pere! You can't complain. - We're leaving. I have to go, Nati's here. Pau, Pere. We're leaving. No! - Yes. We're going home. - What's wrong? Our brother's an idiot, that's what. Pau and Pere, I won't chase you. I can bring them afterwards. We're leaving, Glòria. We'll discuss it later. Is that necessary? - Yes, it is. We'll talk later. - Iris. Auntie... - Bye, love. You'll find a cool den next time. Come on, Iris. Iris. They'll come another day. Where are they going? Far, far, far away! What are you doing? Tighten the straps. Or marijuana. We should be planting marijuana like the kids, it's a good business. We have to do something. Quimet. Quimet! We're going to the protest meeting. You go, we're not coming. - Fucking hell. Just us, then. What now... What's he doing? Fucking hell. Him and his nonsense... - I know, but leave him to it. He's lost it. He wears me out. He really does. - Of course. She's not answering. She never does. She won't answer. They probably had to go to the hospital. I've been saying it for days, this isn't working. Everyone doing their own thing. Right, Mariona? Yes. Mum, if you did a water Ramadan, would you die? Of course, love. - That's it. I don't know, Dolors. You all need to think about what you're going to do. What will you do? Live surrounded by solar panels? Quimet, why did you take it down? It's just shit. That shit's expensive. I don't give a damn. First, put that cigarette out, Quimet. Do we have to go into the barn with candles? Those fucking panels. Roger? Roger? Turn that music down. Dolors. Why don't I have any clean shirts? They're here. Come on. Mum, we could ask Cisco for a new panel. He gets them for free. - Grandpa's here. Dolors. - I pulled my back. Look who's on TV. Let me see. Stretch your leg. Tell me if it hurts. I'll go slowly. Is that Antonio? When did Antonio get so fat? Almost done. And the other one... That guy's from Cal Torrat. And Joan from Cal Colomero. Look, Rogelio, look. I didn't recognise him but now you say it... You need to rest. Turn over, please. And the one at the back is from Cal Pascualín. Well, I never! He got so old. Give me the remote. He got really old. - I've had enough of the TV. Don't turn it off. You need to take it easy. - Dolors, get the doctor a snack. Coffee? - No, thanks. What will we do with you, love? You need to do your exercises. Yes. Cervical, dorsal and lumbar. Yes, that would be good. And patches? - No, no patches. No? - No. Or cream? Quimet, listen to your wife. I don't deserve my wife, but I have to harvest. Dad, when Boubou's finished picking, he's coming to play with me. Yes. Rest and an injection. - Will it work? We'll see tomorrow. Give me two, then! I'll get it ready. He just wants to harvest, he's well enough. What about Cisco? The men are all out of action. What can we do with them? All out of action. Ready for the injection? Shit. Here we go. Hi! - Hi! How's it going? - We've missed you! How's it going? - Good. Really? Less dancing, more picking, okay? Us women can do two things at once. Your dad will tell you off if he sees. - Yes. You're in charge. - I'm sorting them, Auntie. Is this full, Grandpa? Yes, it is. - Great, I'll take it now. We'll do lots of kilos today. Rogelio! What? - See these youngsters? Wearing a sweater in this heat! I don't know how to tell him. Want to come up? - Yes. Up you go. You're a natural. Great! Enough. Try not to pick the small ones. - What? We're the best team. This is your bucket though. Look at this one. - There's no way that's ours. These are too small. Careful not to pick the small ones. - Okay. How's that crate, Grandpa? - Good. Can I help? Yes, pick these small ones out. Put the good ones on top. - Okay. I'll carry it. Now empty it. Let's see if they do it right. What do you mean? - Gently. Ours are perfect. Hold on tight, okay? - I am! Hey, Grandpa! Grandpa! We did all of today's kilos! Your dad will be happy. - I hope so. Quimet! Hey, Mum! We did all of today's kilos and the cooperative congratulated me. That's great. Where's your dad? - Isn't he in bed? No. Quimet! Quimet! Quimet! Quimet! What are you doing here, Dad? Take a look at this. This piece of junk has broken down again. You should be in bed. You didn't fix this properly. We need it to work. We did all the kilos today, Dad! We did all the kilos today, Dad! The people at the cooperative congratulated Roger today. Roger? What he needs to do is study. The school should congratulate him, not the cooperative. Can't you see it? It's a plane, dummy! - No, it's not moving. How could it be a UFO? It's a star, silly. It did a little circle. You're unbelievable, Quimet. Do you seriously believe that? Can't you see? - Yes, you're right. Of course it's a UFO! Coming to abduct Daisy the cow. You're daft as a daisy! I'll take you watering one day and you'll see. See what? They come out and they watch us. - I don't believe you. I swear! Since when do you believe that? I see them every day when I'm watering! You're losing your mind. What a fright! A UFO! - What are you doing up? It's the most beautiful girl in the house. Are you drunk? No, I'm looking after your auntie. Now she's a city girl, she's scared of the countryside noises. If anything, I'm looking after you, if you just loosened up a little, we'd all be more relaxed. What are you laughing at? Oh, no. Another one? - Why are you all awake? Did you hear us? Hey, where are you going? Don't sit down. - Please, Dad! To bed with you! Back to bed. Please! - Come on, sweetheart. To bed, both of you! How come you can stay up? Now, go on. - Good night. They're nuts. I had a nightmare. The house started flying and fell into the reservoir. Go back to sleep. I'm finished here, Dad. What next? Dad? I'm done. Go on up, then. Start with the top field! Come on. Your dad has no nose Your mum's snub-nosed And your little brother And your little brother Has a rat's nose Your dad makes the lunch Your dad makes the lunch Your mum washes up And your little brother And your little brother Chops the vegetables Your dad has no nose Your dad has no nose Your mum's snub-nosed Hang on a minute. Ladies, take a break. I need the men. What's up with you, men? What's going on? Not just one, he broke two ribs. Can you put a plaster cast on it? - No, you can't. Can't you? Men like to complain. Imagine what Cisco's like. From the bed to the sofa, and vice versa. Auntie Nati, why can't you bring Pau and Pere? They're with their dad, sweetie. I told you they weren't coming. But... why? They have to be with their dad now. But I want them to come. You're wearing two different sandals. I wanted to wear this one, but I couldn't find the other... Come on! Back to the rehearsal. "Alamaya alajana." Iris, what are you doing here? Come on, get in. Didn't you hear me? Come on, in you get. Iris, the workers are waiting for me, come on. Now where are you going? Iris. Are you coming or what? Have it your own way then! Stop, stop! - Mariona, I want it. Don't change it. I want her to change it. I want this one. I've had enough. What your siblings need to do is sit down and talk. Sure. As if that's possible... They're both stubborn as mules. Nati and Quimet are two peas in a pod. I'm sick of them walking all over me. You can say no every now and again. I don't say no because of the boys. "I'm running late, pick them up from the bus stop?" I can't take it anymore. I'm tired. I have three kids, not five. It's the same every day. Give them a snack, give them dinner, pick them up... Doesn't Quimet ever stop? How? His back is broken, and my poor son... Yes, poor Roger. And where the hell's Cisco now? He's the worst of them all. He wants to be alternative... - Yes, and my sister's just the same. What do you want? - Ice cream! But I understand they have to work. Has the film finished, Mariona? No. Yes, they need to work. Especially with this mess. What mess? - They have to pay for school now. Mariona, I've already fixed your dress for the Escala en HiFi. I'll have to adjust it again. Let her eat it. Yes, but... Well, well... Unbelievable. That's my girl. I worry about your dad. He worries the most. - Of course. Dad's not stupid. He knows something's going on. Yes, but he thinks it's something else. Because... You don't see it because you're not here. I know I'm not. Dad would be devastated. - Who's going to deal with this mess? Who knows, but Dad's the one who suffers... Good afternoon. - Afternoon. A coffee, please. A coffee. He has his cards. - I didn't take any cards! What's this? - Give him four of these. You went too far, Tresona! Goddamn it, Tresona. You're not so bright today, huh? What do you need? Put it here. Yours... Let's see what you've got. - It's looking good! Know what we could do today? Bet our drinks. The cards are looking good today! Things are going our way. Or you could bet your land, Tresona. He's really going for it! Let me finish this. I need to think it over. Go on. - Go on. This one. I can't... That's yours. This is mine. I can't bet them, I've already sold them. I sold them to Nufri. They take everything that comes up. Them and two other companies. They take it all. Not here, but in La Segarra and Les Garrigues. In Torres, too. There are three or four farmers who will also sell. For sale? If they sell, they'll be dirt cheap. They'll abandon their land. At this rate, they'll have to abandon them. Really? We went to get roast chicken. - So what did you do with your Fricandó? I didn't make it! But I do make a good one. Really? - You take two steaks. Yes. - Season them. Then make a sauté with onions and a few tomatoes and it's good if you have a broth. I don't put tomatoes in. - I do. It makes it taste funny. - No, no... Listen to me. It will never be as good as Mum's. I do it the same. - No. You use an electric blender, Mum didn't. They didn't have those before! That's why it was so good. - They used a pestle and mortar. Take them to Grandpa. Let me finish explaining the recipe! - Explain, explain. Here, Grandpa. - Wow. There are so many. Can I try some? Yes, of course. Serve yourself. Our home speciality is sole with shrimp. Oh, please explain. It must be Glòria. I'd say so. It's Glòria's car. Yes, it's white. She can pick some grapes. These grapes are so ripe. Hi! What shall we play? Who got you those guns? - Mum bought them for us. They are so ripe. - Yes. The boys are over there. - Pau, Pere? Where's your mum? She says she has a lot of work. What do you mean? Too busy for her own dad? She's been working non-stop for days, Dad. Boys, come and kiss your auntie, I haven't seen you for days. Run, run! We're at war! Quickly! Quickly! No, through the door, it's way cooler! Come through the door. Quickly, my friends! - Can we come in? Yes, yes! Quickly, my friends. We're exhausted, we've come from the war. Yes. War's so hard. I have a basement where I'll feed you and you can come out when the war is over. You'll be fine. Bang, bang, bang! - Here. Bang, bang, bang, bang! They can shoot us here! Quickly! Bang, bang, bang! Boom! - Bang, bang, bang... Iris! Iris! Iris! - I'm here! We found a new den, want to see it? Look! What are you doing? - Playing. Why are Pau and Pere here? Auntie Glòria brought us. Look, Dad, look! I lost a tooth, look. Let's see. Great, don't lose it. - It's here. I can't find it now. Let's climb up to the top. What are you doing with your foot? - Stop it. Knock, knock. Who's there? Iris! Lovely, sweetie. - I'm the boss! Watch how she dances I'm melting That's my dress! You can't wear it. Mariona, it's too small for you. - Mum let me wear it, I lost a tooth and the tooth fairy didn't bring me anything. I'm wearing this. No, Mum! The black one looks great. But it's so serious. I wore this for Roger's confirmation, I have to make the most of it. No, the black one looks great. But this one's cute! The short one was better. - No, I looked like a sausage. I'll wear this one with a little jacket. This jacket. What do you think? The one you're wearing is better. Is that lipstick? I don't know which one to wear. Let's see. What do you think? - The one you're wearing. No, because all three of us will be wearing pink. I haven't finished with that. Where are you taking the lipsticks? Roger! - Listen to your mum! Roger! Roger! Watch how she dances I'm melting I'm the boss! Watch how she dances I'm melting You never listen. I don't want them to come back. I don't listen? You don't listen! Can't you see the whole family is worried? You always do whatever you want. - Who's worried? Get lost! Haven't you seen your family? They're absolutely fine. - No, they're not! Your daughter hasn't seen the twins for days! Well, she has a sister! So this is normal for you? For the two days you're here, keep your nose out! You're so manipulative. - Really? Of course! - Seriously? Fucking hell! Now I remember why I never come here. Get lost, then. Quimet, don't leave me here like this. Mariona, Pumpkin, you look pretty today. Do I need my shotgun? Glòria went and left and I forgot to give her that Swiss roll for her friend who likes it so much. It's not her friend, it's her girlfriend. Goddamn it, those rabbits! What are you doing, Quimet? - Damn it. Quimet? - Back in a second. You'll get your shirt dirty! Come back! Let him wash his own shirt, then. Where are you going? Come back! The plastic isn't on right, the rabbits can eat everything. Auntie left because Dad kicked her out. He's all thumbs. Dad says it's a fucking plague and they'll eat everything. Don't swear like that. That's what Dad said. Mind your shoes. You're filthy! Little piggy. Look at your feet. You're covered in dirt. We have a winner! Quimet! Quimet! We have our champion! Bravo! Amazing! Incredible! What a presence! These guys are true artists! Fabulous! Coming up next... Why aren't you going, Mariona? Go on. - Leave me alone. Now Ivet, Ona, Gal•la, Mariona and Núria from the boss gang will perform The Boss. A round of applause! Go on! You've been practising for days! Oh, they're a foursome. Go on, love. Come on, Mariona. Don't be like that. I'm sick of saying it, get up there! Listen to your mother. I'll video you and send it to your auntie. Go and dance. Get on up there! If not, I'll go! - So will I! Shall we get on stage? You're all so annoying! Miss, Miss! How are you? Fine. - Ready to see the girls dance? Hey, what's up? Cheer up, mate, we're all friends here. Come on! For fuck's sake, come on! Hey. Want to be my brother-in-law? - We're just talking. She's my sister. We're just talking. - She's my sister. We're just dancing. - So? Stop it! I can look after myself. - Stop. Don't hit me! You're an idiot! Where have you been? Dancing at the Festa Major. But our brother's an idiot so I came back early. Look what the tooth fairy brought me. It's really cool. We'll play with it tomorrow, okay? Time to sleep. Good night. - Night. Cisco. Cisco. Have you seen my son? Have you seen Roger? It won't go in. We should go pick mangoes in the Caribbean, they're pricey. Get in the car. Hey, Auntie! It's been a while! How are you? Where are you going? - You legend! Hey! - Hey, Roger! Get in, let's go! Get out of the mud. You'll get covered in it. I mean... Goddamn it, watch when I catch Roger... Get out of the mud, go on. Look at this... Goddamn it! For God's sake. Boubou, when the season's over... Fucking hell! - ...will you stay here? No, I have to go and work somewhere else. How can we harvest... like this? Shit. Fucking hell. Move. Can you believe this? Fuck... I told him. Damn it! - It's easy to make a mistake. A mistake? Fuck it... These trees looked so good. They won't die. By nap time, there'll be no water left. That's enough, Iris. Dolors. Tell her to stop with the recorder. I can't hear myself think! She won't listen. Give me the recorder. Dolors. Look who's here. This clown. Can you manage? What a show. So? What did we agree? Can you stand up? Weren't you supposed to change the irrigation board? You fool! The trees will all die. If it gets any hotter today... Thanks. I'll leave the water here, Dad. Careful, Dad! Dad! Stop, Dad! Dad! Goddamn it! Damn it. Just wonderful. Mind your head. Lower the bars. Let me do it. Lower the bars, careful! Damn it to hell... Help your brother, I said. There! Look, there! Quickly! Give me the gun. Give it to me. - Quickly. Come on! There! Go fetch it. Here it is! Good, come on. In it goes. Here. Ready? - Yes. Car, car! It's gone. Shall I ring the bell? - Yes! Let's go! Quickly! WE'VE HAD ENOUGH ENOUGH LIES, WE WANT FAIR PRICES WE WANT FAIR PRICES! Comrades, we're here at the large distributors to report what they're doing. They want to pay us 15 cents when production costs us over 30. Do you think we can live off 15 cents for this fruit here today? No! It's the way to exterminate farming! The government wants everything for the big companies. Fifteen cents and we'll disappear! Fifteen cents and the young people will be driven from the land. Fifteen cents and our land will fall into the hands of speculators. Fifteen cents and we'll have to sell our houses. We can't allow that! We want to live off the land! Here's to the land! Down with large distributors! Hooray! Thieves! Thieves! We want fair prices! We want fair prices! We want fair prices! The fruit has a price. FRUIT IS PRICELESS! We want fair prices! I'll show her. - About time. I'll teach her. I just draw them on with a marker pen. Who does she think she is? I refuse to do more. I take it to her and say: "Auntie, the name tags." If only that's all it was... I take everything to her. - Everything. Ladies, are you doing this on purpose? Hand me that, come on. - Here, bossy. "Cut down these trousers. There's a hole in the knee." Okay, Mum? - Here. More pots? - Yes. How are they doing? - What do you think? Let me see. Take them out. - Really? Yes. Okay, careful. Come on. Help us, Teia. Lift it up! No, no, no... Yes, look. Come on. Come on, let's go. Now over here. We could take it to the den. - No? No. Look, Grandpa! Look! Grandpa! We've got the poor rabbit that drowned in the pool!
