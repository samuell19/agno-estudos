Thanks to his rich father-in-law. Then again, 90% of his assets belong to his wife. He's just fronting. Really! Where's MY father-in-law? How's your wife? She SHOULD be doing fine. We got a divorce.

That'll be the right thing to do for the Kim family with not many children. Just one more, okay? How about two more for a volleyball team? There's an idea. Nonsense! Nonsense! Stop it. Not there. I miss Besame Mucho. The cafe in the country side? Where we first met! I doubt it's still there. That was a long time ago. It was!

Head Office recommended someone to take over. This'll be your last week. I don't understand. If you can't do it, you should quit. This is so unreasonable. Head Office wanted this done and you didn't join us. I am so sorry. Dad! Daddy! Come here, my precious ones! Not until after dinner. What's the occasion? It's not mom's birthday yet. What do we have here? It's from your friend... Jinsuk? He sent this? We have no room for this. Send it back. No! The piano is mine! Play some! If you're good, we'll keep it. Dad. -Come on, darling! -No. Come on. And turn... Haeoh. Click! -When does the picture come out? -I am not sure. My little sweetie! -Dig in, Jioh! -Yes. How come you don't eat octopus? She doesn't. Because she's fussy. Settle down, kids. -Want some more rice? -Fill it to the brim with rice! Perhaps I should quit my job and open a restaurant. I mean with your cooking skills! Don't even think it! -What are you doing? -Keeping household accounts. We're loaded! One more payment left on your dead brother's debts. After that, we'll keep saving and move into a 3 bedroom apartment in 2 years. Thank god all the payments are made. At least, I've been bringing home a fat paycheck. -It didn't take too long. -True. What's this? No name on it? Give it back to me! Some secret account of your own? Give it back. Give it back to me! Hey, I want to see it. Stop it! Aah! Stop it! You really like free stuff! God is with me. He answers my prayers. God must be bored these days. Could you be more attentive? I AM! -Did you call for Chinese noodles? -Yeah. Too much dust. Wear this. I think I have a problem. I keep coughing. You have your God! Stop the nonsense and polish this. Hey you! You clean yours! Don't call him "Hey." Show some respect. He's your older brother. Dear God Let me get out of this hell. I need rest and peace of mind most. Let my parents love only me. and let me grow up soon And marry Ricky Martin! Amen. Chinese food is here! Is this the residence of Mr. Chulsoo Lee? Yes? We're from the Court Office. Were you a guarantor for Mr. Kang?. Yes. Mr. Kang defaulted on a note for 700 million won and disappeared. According to the Civil Law 527, Article 611, your property And possessions are seized What's all this about? Seizure? Didn't you receive the repayment notice? From now on, you're not to remove those seizure stickers off of the subject items. That's illegal and you will be prosecuted accordingly. In case you don't pay it all back by the 12th of next month, ...this apartment will be auctioned off. Can you repay the debt now? -We'll proceed according to the law. -You go away. No. You've got the wrong house. This must be a mistake. This is the right house madam. No! What are we going to do? Don't worry. I'll handle it. You even got fired! It'll take 30 years to come up with that kind of money. How will you get the money in one month? You're insane. You must be, doing all this! You be nice to your dad from now on. Don't ask him for money or toys I won't allow it. Come and talk to me instead. We already do. I'll start working tomorrow. You have to get ready for school for yourself. No more newspaper, milk, and yogurt! No more private lessons! Really? I don't have to take my lessons? But [ still want to go to my ballet lessons. -Listen to me! -No, I'll keep going there. You're so immature. I got the leading role in our ballet presentation. It must have been hard for you to bring this up. I'd like to and should lend you the money. But I don't have any. I'm not any better off. Sorry. No, I am sorry. You sound just the same. How have you been? That much money made on real state? Turn it down! And? That's just great... Turn it down! By the way Can you lend me some money? Bitch. Didn't I lend her money For her sick child? Hello! Did you move? What? You want the police to come after you? My god, get in there! Mom, she started it! No more. Go to your room. As you know, I was never a good student. And now, a lot of MBA holders from the U.S. are working under me. What good is it to become the top of the class in school? That's why I don't pressure my kids to study. They can just play computer games. And if they're good, I'll support them fully. Who knows? They might make a hell of a lot money with it! You silly! Taeoh. Yeah, what? Do you by any chance have any...? Have you heard about Dongho? He's in deep shit now! What happened? Thanks to Jinsuk Kang. He lost 100 million won lent to Jinsuk. Jinsuk defaulted on 700 million won. Not everyone is cut out for business. Anyone here lend money to Jinsuk? No way. Sit down! Good to know. Long time no see! Hey, Seungmin. Come on here. Sure. Come here. I hear you're raking in money. How have you been? Good to see you here at the alumni meeting. How's it going? -Okay. -Yeah... I heard you moved to another company. Is it nice? I'll see how it goes. How about you? About to quit. Been setting up my own business. Your own business? Online securities company and I'm a bit short of money. Seungmin, do you have any spare money? About 50 million won. -What's happened to you? -What? At least, you didn't lie before. -What do you mean? - I know you got fired yesterday. This is crazy. My former coworker will be your replacement. Crazy. On top of everything else, coming home like this! Jioh, Jioh! I've got pizza for you. Youndoo, Jadoo wake up! You stink! Your beard, so rough! You must be enjoying this. Go brush your teeth and get to bed! Yeah. Ouch! Ouch! Couldn't you just come home safe? My hands are full with four kids as they are! Stupid to get hurt! Delicious? Yummy? Yeah. Good! Stop it. I already know how you feel. I closed the savings account today. 27 million won. 100 million won to go. Don't be so weak. I know you are strong. Kids. No one can force us to leave. No one is going to force us to leave. Because I am Chulsoo Lee! They can't fucking break me! Honey. Jioh, Haeoh I can still run. I can still run I can run. I'm going to fucking run. Fuck. Honey! Daddy! I'm not with the company, but I'd like to continue to manage your shares. I won't disappoint you. Trust me. Thanks but no thanks. No investment without reliable information. I'm confident. Trust me! Information is the key factor. I need juicy tips to trust you. For example, tips on BN System. You've changed a lot. Time has passed. 20 day before repayment deadline I was hesitant about coming here. First time since high school. What if you don't recognize me? You look just the same. Haven't changed one bit. I read the article on your donations to schools. A pleasant surprise. And I remembered the old days. Remember I was pursuing you for three years? Long letters to you were never answered. Not even a glance at me. I'm sorry about those days. That's in the past. -Are you married? -Yeah, -Kids? -Four. What does your husband do? Used to work for a securities company. He lost his job. I have a favor to ask you. I know this is too much to ask. But I know you from school, and maybe there's hope. My husband cosigned for someone who defaulted. Our apartment is slipping away. 100 million won will save it. Pardon me, sir. Your appointment is at 3 at the Hotel Shilla. Better get going I know. I'm sorry, we didn't even have coffee together. That's all right. Leave your number and I'll call you. You hit me! How dare you? Shut up! You four kids are ganging up on my son. He did it first, he did... The son of a bitch said we are beggars. Come on! What, son of a bitch? What's wrong with you? We're not beggars! My mom said so. That you beggars will be thrown out of your house. Didn't you, mom? Who called us beggars? Mom. Stop crying. I know this is too much to ask... But can I see the plans? That's not possible. Please! I'll pretend I never heard this. I still respect you. After paying my brother's debts, I thought we'd be better off. I really am sorry. Sorry... What have we done to deserve this? No choice. This is our reality. We could rent a small room. I'll check it up with the real estate agent. I won't move out of this house. I earned it. Our first child Eunoh died of asthma in a small basement-level studio. I was using the sewing machine, dusting the place, while he was dying of pneumonia. Just to make a few more bucks. My heart was torn when we scattered his ashes into the river. To me, this house means him. I'll never lose any of our children again. I cancel led everything but the insurance policy for their future. Can you make the payment tomorrow? You're so immature. Do you think mom will be happy with a birthday gift now? What do we do then? Lottery tickets naturally. Win two 50 million won prizes, and we won't have to move. That's not easy. God never disappointed me. Always answers my prayers. That's true. I don't like that. How about a vote? It's split one to one between us. You decide Youndoo. What do you think? Move into a tiny basement apartment with no room for your piano? No! Your choice! Hands up! Who told you to break your piggybank? And didn't even won 1,000 won. Hello? Is this Ms. Kim's house? Yes. A package for you. Please sign here. Pretty shoes. Mom, did daddy send all this? It must be for mom's birthday. Keep your hands up! Come on! How did you like the opera? Well, it's been a while. You used to like it. Did I? Madam Butterfly was a true story included in an American magazine. A play writer called David something adapted it for stage and Puccini made it into an opera. I used to listen to it a lot back in high school. I've been forgetting about it. If you hadn't come we would have never met again. I'm glad you still look pretty much the same. It's nice to be rich. You said you need money? Thank you. It might take a while but I'll pay it back. What's your account number? I don't need money. No, that's not right. It's a big sum. It's all right. No, I can pay it back. Don't. I want something else instead. You're still pretty. Madam Butterfly was a geisha selling her body. In comparison, this'll be the best transaction! I am sorry. I asked for too much. 17 day before repayment deadline You are insane. 17 day before repayment deadline This'll be the last time. Get me the data. -Please! Listen, this is so not like you. What's to be like me? After ten years, they fired me for being honest. My best friend took away my house and ran away. I have nothing to lose or fear. My children are... my last hope to keep. I need the file. This is the data you wanted. 2 billion won is to be used, with 1 billion to be the expected profit. I'd like 10% of it. Those are not great terms for me. I could lose the capital and you risk nothing. I won't take a penny if you don't get the expected profit.. Are you confident? If I weren't, I wouldn't have started this. 15 day before repayment deadline 12 day before repayment deadline 9 day before repayment deadline This is our monthly wine club get-together. I told them about you, and they are anxious to see you. You can just have a casual talk with them. No pressure. Yes, sir. The shares on Whajin Tech seem stagnant. We've got the shares, and necessary data. No need to worry. Are you wearing some perfume? Nice! My usual. What fragrance do you like, Mr. Lee? You look better. Have some more. Hello! Mr. Jang, this is Mr. Lee I told you about. Mr. Lee, this is our corporate lawyer. Hello, how are you? I'm Chulsoo Lee. Hi, nice to meet you. Hello! Hello! Hi! Is Chairman Kim here? He's waiting for you. Come this way. 0,1,6 Hey, you're still up? A lullaby? You said you don't like it any more. I see. Rock a bye baby, in the tree top, when the wind blows, the cradle will rock... You weren't around. Where were you? I was resting in the den. Should have rested at home. It was a party for couples. Plus I got to talk with Mr. Lee. Mrs. Lee somebody left this for you He asked me to hand it to you. Thank you. What's the meaning of this? They are the keys to my house. Whenever you are ready. I'm not that kind! Don't do this again. -Honey... -Yeah? Nothing. One week left! Don't worry. I'll keep this house no matter what. I already know! But you're the only one to turn to. Please, this'll be the last time. Are you listening? Are you still there? Can you hear me? 7 day before repayment deadline It's me. Couldn't reach you at work or your home. Where are you now? Call me once you get this message. Please! My husband told me you're having a hard time at home. Will get better thanks to you. Thanks for the other day. I didn't see anything. Nobody else knows about it, right? No one's around here. -Don't do this to me. -It's all right. Things are going well. Do you want to stop? Why didn't you tell me? You are as honest as one an ever be. That's why you were fired. Why would you not tell me? If I did, would you be able to resolve it? We are husband and wife. I quit it. I'm not in it any more. Stop it! Why should I give you the share? Who else would compensate me? My husband hired you. You caused all this. All right. I'll take care of it. Quiet down. How will you handle it? You were getting 10% from him. I can give you 20%. Are you joking? Does it matter whose money you use for the investment? I'll advance you 100 million won. Take me to your house. I want to do it in your bed. -You're insane. -Correct. I've got to be insane to make such an offer to someone like you! 5 day before repayment deadline Eight and... one, and two, and three, and four... What happened? She's been watching us from outside the windows for days. I asked her in. Severely asthmatic. I had no idea. She seems stressed out. She should stay here for a few days till her breathing becomes stable. Doctor, will she be all right? What happened? Where's Youndo? She's hospitalized. Where are you going? To get the money. We can't just let her slip away like our first son. Did you have lunch? I don't care about lunch now. How could you eat at a time like this? If only you hadn't lost the house, we wouldn't be in this mess. Right, it's all my fault. Yes, it's all your fault. That's why I'm running around like a dog for the money. How soon can you make 100 million won that way! We have not just one, but four kids. Even without the medication, it's hard to make a living. Do you realize how much it takes to raise the kids? Jioh's mom never contributed a dollar. That's enough. The kids can hear us! Where are your buddies? Where are your school friends when we're struggling like this? You've done so much for them! Okay, I'll be back with the money. I'll do anything to get it! Do whatever it takes! This policy will mature this month. Why not wait for it? I know. I'd just like to close the account. Did you bring the fees for the organ test? The surgery will take 3 to 4 hours, ...and you'll be hospitalized for 3 weeks I want to be upfront about this. A healthy person can survive with only one kidney. However, some complications may occur after the surgery. I'll call you about the results tomorrow. Hello! Hello! The results are due today. I've been waiting for two hours. I still haven't heard from you. Call me at the coffee house when you get this message. I'll be waiting. 3 day before repayment deadline Can we talk? Is this because he's not your real son? Chulsoo! He's no blood relation to you. But, to me, he's like my own son. Don't you remember What my brother said when dying? I've done my share. Money, money, money. He must have been driven to the edge. Right! That's what I thought, too. His friends made fun of him being poor. He must have felt terrible! Is this you, Jioh? I know... ...yes... I know On the 12th, 12th. Yes, I fully understand. I'll pay it back even if I have to rob your bank. Okay? -Is it good? -Yeah. Who's that, mom? Do you know him? No, I don't know him. Let's get in. I'll come and see your new sofa. -Sure, see you. -See you. Hello! Have you been to the hospital? Yes. If you need money, please tell me. Good bye. Be careful. Hello! Do you know Youndoo's hospitalized? How come? What's wrong with her? Is this what you like? It was a gift for my wife. Now I smell of your wife. How do you kiss your wife? Remember Hyoungsuk? He used to ask for money for his rocket building project. He's a professor at KAIST now. Youngmin used to live in your neighborhood. He delivered all my letters to you, did you know? I'm going to go take a shower. Jioh, Let's play some baseball. What's wrong? I heard something from outside. Ignore it. Jioh, Jioh! Let's play some baseball. Nobody's out there. I can't do this. Let's just stop. We've a long way to go. Sorry. You'd better get going. Don't do this. Please leave. We've just begun. Stop it! After you had your way with me! You caused the whole nonsense. You almost stole the documents you have. What's the difference between that and selling your body? I am sorry. Younghee! Don't do this to me. Let me go! Please forgive me. Mom, I've got to pee. Mom, Mom! It must be nice for you to have a mother. Yeah. I used to have my mother around. When I was young, we were So poor. No father, practically no food. One day I was coming home from school. I saw my mother at the marketplace. I was happy to see her and almost said, "Hi, mom!" But I had to hide instead. She was shoplifting some octopus at a grocery store. On the dinner table lay the octopus - nicely prepared. I loved octopus but didn't even touch it. And not even a glance at my mother. I was embarrassed... And now I think I know... How she felt as she was stealing that octopus. I am sorry. I just had to leave. My mom stole the octopus to feed me but I just couldn't do it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't keep the promise to save the house. I tried everything I could... Indeed, everything I could do Sorry. The day before repayment deadline Jadoo, can you give me a hand? Dear God! Please ignore my prayers from now on. But just once this time, please answer my prayer. I promise I'll share prizes ...and clean the fish tank. So please don't let us have to move out! I don't want to move. It's me, Younghee. I've got something to tell you. Sorry about the last time. I apologize. Are you at home? What time do you get out? I'd like to see you. It doesn't matter if it's late. No, I have to see you. I'll come over to your house. I don't mind it very late. Finish your work first. Yes. I can wait. Yes. If you're not up to this, you can go home. It's your choice. 7 AM, April 12, repayment deadline What time is it? We don't have to move out. Get up. Let's go to the bank. You get commission based on the number of clients visiting your site. With the recession, you don't make much money. At least you can afford to be honest here. Thank you. Jihoon Han at Neo M&A, didn't he lend you the money? Yes, my wife knows him from high school. You'll have to work your ass off to pay it back. I'll work hard and pay it all back. Is this Neo M&A? Could I speak to your president? Yeah, I'd like to come visit him. I'm Chulsoo Lee. He knows Younghee Kim. She's my wife. Yes. Daddy. Quiet down! You bought a new dress? New shoes, too? Didn't daddy get them for your birthday? She wore these shoes to the opera. One, Two, Three, Four Did you order? Would you like your noodles cut up? Yes, cut hers up fine, but not mine, please. What's the occasion? Visiting me at work. Just because. It's been a while since we had cold noodles together. Right? -Darling? -Yeah? I... It's very hard for me. Do you want coffee instead? It's very hard for me. You're the only one I can talk to. I can't go on with a straight face. Don't speak. I... One more word, I won't tolerate. I slept with another man for money. I needed the money. I knew it wasn't right but I did it. I'm sorry, darling. Jihoon Han, I met him. If you cared about the kids and me, you should have kept the secret to the grave. No matter how much it hurts You should have kept it to yourself. Why did you have to tell me? Shouldn't have... until the last moment. I meant to keep it in my heart till I die. But I can't. Every time I see the kids or you, I get so scared. Day by day I try to pull myself together. But I just can't go back to the way I was. I can't. I could have let it pass. I was going to let it slide and go on. What now? It'll be hell to face each other from now on. What do we do now? 1 month later How's the presentation coming along? All right. Could you ask someone else to go on this business trip? You're in charge of the project. They are expecting you. Something urgent? No, I can't just leave the kids alone for three days. Isn't your wife at home? I'm sick of this. We've had it for a month. I miss Mom's food. Are you crazy? -You didn't like it, so I tossed it. -You! -If you're done, go away. -Pick it up. You pick it up. -Pick it up. -None of your business. What's all this about? You're not even our family. Our dead uncle was your real father. Don't you think I know? Isn't this a picture of your family? Without you, mom and dad would have liked me better. Go away. Mom left us because of you! Daddy. Am I too heavy? No. Light as a feather. I think this is our first piggyback. Tonight I'll make it up to you. I wanted to be strong. And I never showed my weak side to others. Even when my brother died, ...and when your grandparents died, I didn't cry. But... Just can't help crying now. I really meant well. And worked hard. But I only hurt you and couldn't protect mom. How did this happen? I'm too ashamed to face you. I wonder what you think of me. I'm scared. Can you understand me? Can you understand me? The lamb got scared and ran away. The lion became sad. -No, sadder. -Sadder. Mom! Dad! Dad! Mom! Did you see me dancing in the center? He did. He even took some pictures. Dad, I didn't cough at all. Right, mom? Boy, she talks. Didn't I look like a real fairy? Of course, only prettier. Really? I am prettier? No you were the ugliest! Can you take a picture of us? Sure. Smile. Thanks. Would you like me to take one of you? If you would! Okay, gather around. Jioh! Why are you standing over there, silly? Wow, big family! Come on, smile. Whiskey, cheese, kimchi... Here we go! Smile, smile! One, two, two and a half Three.
