Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Frenchy LeVonne, the jitterbug queen from Quebec. Presenting Nona Carver, the blonde Venus. I know that you are going to enjoy - Leon, Leon. - Yeah? Before you go further, I just saw - the most wonderful thing. - And what was that? - I saw a lion tamer. - A lion... He was remarkable, he took his arm and he put it right down the throat, - right up to there. - No kidding. His right arm right down the throat up to there. - Well, what's that fella's name? - They call him Lefty now. Well, listen, what are you doing out here anyway? Well, I figured I'd come out and interrupt you, - have a little fun. - Well, you shouldn't do a thing like that... well, this is my bread and butter. Go out to the place that you work and break your. - You wouldn't like it. - You've got something there. Well, indeed I have. See my name out there up top in front of the theater? -I saw the men's room... -After all, you know what - they're gonna do? - Yeah, this a burlap show. - Now, a. - Why? Her in the dressing room, no clothes on. Oh, that's what we want, undressed women. Is an artist studio. - Hey, I know that. - Oh no, a pantomime scene, - they don't talk in it. - I remember that scene. - You remember the scene? - But, differently. - Differently? - We have to go through the motions and I'll explain to these people just... - A narrator? - No, I got a mother and father. Look, you're going to explain it. I'll leave the whole thing in your hands. Oh, thank you, that's nice now, as a kid, I used to be able to switch hands, I like the way he said that. Well, we might as well. Ah yeah, first up's approaching, I think it's a woman. Yeah, I'd lay 6 to 5 it's a woman. She is followed in by a tall, dark, handsome man, which is her husband. We always use a handsome Cuban. How did skunk puss get in there? "How do you do?" he says. She says, "How do you do? Give me some money." He said, "A Kiss.” "Money.” "A Kiss." He goes for the money... make sure you get the right roll, kid, the little one... he got it. Gives her the money, when in walks our handsome hero Mr. Leon DeVoe. Ah, he smells her but he can't locate her. She drops her kerchief very gently but daintily. Ah, she used to pitch for the Yanks. He says, "Pardon me, Miss, your kerchief. How about joining me in a banana split?" She says, "Sure, I'll split a banana with you." What's one more banana in her life? So, off they go to the artist studio. And now, ladies and gentlemen, our next scene, we take you right to the little spider's web. The artist studio, which you can always tell, because there's a hall tree, a screen, a couch, and a bottle of whiskey. When in walks Ophelia Openstretch. That's her name, not her condition. She is followed in by Jake the plumber. Jake locks the key and puts the door in his pocket. - I screwed that up, didn't I? - Yeah. "Oh, what a beautiful studio," she says. "You have liquor, would you like a drink?" She says, "I certainly would," says, "Okay, kid, slap it on the wood," so she sits down. Very good view from down there, not bad, eh? She says, "Well, pour 'em out. How about a little toast?" He said, "Toast? Well, here's looking up your whole" family"... 1 gotta keep those words together, yes, I forgot. She says, "You told me you had some pictures." He says, "Pictures? Wait till you see my masterpiece. Here's the first picture I ever painted, and I'll be glad to show it to you." And here is the picture. Isn't that a beautiful study? Just gaze at that, the name of that picture is called. "Rebecca at the Pub." Look at the pumps on Rebecca. Notice she's got a rose in her mouth. She'd look much better with a big salami in her hand. That's picture number one. Now, she says, "I could pose like that." He says, "No, you have too many clothes on." This guy knows what he wants. "Take off your hat." She says, "Oh no." "Take off your hat, take off your... ." Give her a drink of schnapps, Leon. So, she drinks some of that 35-cent whiskey. You know, it makes you do a lot of things. Off comes the hat, and the artist takes it, puts it on the hall tree. The hall tree, the big thing standing straight up... Yeah, no, over here. Yeah, that's it, right there, that's right. She says, "Have you any more pictures?" He says, "I certainly have." Wait till you see the next picture."" So, now we get ready for picture number two, and here it is. A very beautiful study. Isn't that pretty? Now, the name of this picture is called, "I Cover the Waterfront." No, that's wrong, it's really called, "September Morn." You know, we had a hard time to get a girl to pose for this picture, but luckily this kid's got nice big hands. Well, that's picture number two. "Why not pose me like that?" He says, "No, you still have too many clothes on. Take off your skirt and coat." She says, "Ah, no." He says, "Come on, take off your skirt and coat." She says, "Ah"... look at that old bag acting coy, will ya? Well, "Take off the skirt." Give her a drink of schnapps. So, she takes another drink of Panther Hiss. Panther Hiss, it's very good stuff, it's a new whiskey. She drinks it, off comes the coat. Look at the artist, warming up his ukulele already. Yep, there it comes. Have you noticed the headlights on the new Buicks? They're not bad. She says, "Oh, well, now", this boy knows what he really wants. We're getting down to bare facts. Show me another picture.” So, now we get ready for the big masterpiece. And here is the big picture. Isn't that pretty? It's a very wonderful picture and the name of it is called, "The Cherry Sisters." One's got a grapefruit, the other's got a lemon. Too bad, kid, it had to happen sometime. Well, anyway, go on to the next picture. She says, "I suppose I got myself." He says, "No, you have too many clothes on." Take off the brassiere and panties.” She says, "Oh, no." He says, "Come on, take off the brassiere and panties." She says, "Oh, no." "Take off the"... Give her the whole bottle. Get 'em off, no use in waiting. She drinks it, she never drank so much water in all her life. She starts to take off her brassiere. He says, "Hold it." He goes for the brush. The brush! Don't make no U-turns. Oh, look at the size of the brush that guy's got. He don't wanna paint her, he's gonna Simonize her or swab her out, he's got different ideas. He throws it down, he takes her in his arms, he hugs her, he kisses her, he squeezes her. She screams. Oh, scream. Can't scream no louder? That's all, it's all yours now, kid, scream. Who did I get to scream? Her husband's coming in. Oh, you're almost up, fix your hair, and your tie, now pull up your pants. Open the door and let him in. He opens the door and in walks the kid himself. Ah, look what I see. That's me, look out, Leon. "How do you do?" He says, "How do you do?" Says, "I would like my picture painted." The artist said, "Do you want full length or bust?" The kid says, "I'll bust you in the nose. Is my wife here?" He says, "Why, no." "Don't tell me," he says, "I smell something and it stinks." "Don't look at me, kid, it must be the scene.” "Why," he says, "you dirty viper, there's her clothes." "Ah," the artist said, "He's wise." "That's hers all right, I recognize it. I'm going to kill you." The kid goes for his gun. The artist goes for his rod. Your rod, your rod, that's right. They fire! The artist fires. What kind of a gun do you got? - Shot him with a silencer. - But, you're dead. You die on the couch, you got the good suit on. You're stuck, Jim, you die with your face in the sun on the chair. Out comes that beautiful wife from behind the screen. She looks at her lover, he's dead. She looks at her husband and faints. The other end. There she stands, alone in the world, ladies and gentlemen, gaze at her. Gaze at her, a picture of blonde hair and loveliness, beauty, youth, and health, and says, "What'll I do, what'll I do?" I'll tell you what to do, honey, now that they're both dead. You come with me to my apartment. - And then? - We'll turn down the lights. And then? I'll love you, and you'll love me. - And then? - Well, and then... - Send for me! - Ya-huh? Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. That's it. Ladies and gentlemen, the South American cyclone, Chili Pepper. Ladies and gentlemen, your kind attention for a few moments. I claim the distinction of being the champion pistol shot of that great state of Texas. Now, for my first experiment, I'm gonna have to have the assistance of some young man with the heart of a lion and the strength of a Goliath. I don't care who he is, if he, uh... Just a minute, son, come over here. I think I can use you, boy. No, I've been used before. Ah, but, son, look here, you never been used until you been used by a Texan, son. - That's what I'm afraid of. - What? - Those longhorns. - Oh, now wait a minute, boy. Just a minute, don't get excited. I'm the champion pistol shot of that great state of Texas. Yessiree, do you smoke cigarettes? - Sure. - Well, just pull one out here. I'm gonna show you something, son. Now, just take that cigarette and put it on your mouth here. Now, stand right over there, that's fine. I'll walk over here, and I'll turn, and I'll shoot that cigarette right out of your mouth. You'll shoot a cigarette out of whose mouth? - Out of your mouth, boy. - Oh, no, no, no. My mother didn't raise any foolish children. Oh, now, wait a minute, boy, you don't have to be afraid of me, son, I'm the champion pistol shot of that great state of Texas. I'll send my brother around, he don't care - what happens to him. - Nah, you don't have to worry, - son, I'm a good shot. - You are? - Yes, sir. - How good are ya? Well, I can walk out of this here building, turn and walk across the street, weave and fire, and hit the front of this here building. - Yes, sir. - Well... Wait a minute, this is a pretty big building. Yeah, but look at the size of that bullet. What's the size of the bullet got to do with it? Ah, it's got everything in the world to do, son. Trajectory, wind resistance, and elevation. Everything in the world. That's right, I never thought of that. Why, certainly, son, now just put that cigarette in your mouth and stand right over there. Everything will be over shortly. Now, just stand still there, son. Hey, boy, hey, boy, don't move around like that. Come on, stand still, will ya, son? -Don't do that to me, I can't... -Who's moving around? Son, what are you doing? You know you're jumping around like a cottontail with turpentine on his cotton. Son, you can't do that to me, you've got to stand still. Now, put that cigarette in your mouth there. Now, hold it there, now just stand still. Now, don't move like that, boy, I'll shoot you a shot, yeah. Hey, son, where'd ya go? Where did I go? Well, uh, just keep talking, I'll shoot into the voice. You'll shoot into the voice? Oh, there ya are, I see ya now, son, yes. Yeah, but shoot into the voice? You don't have to worry about me, son, - I got perfect vision. - You have? Double, 20/20. - No kidding. - Yessiree. - I'm gonna try you out. - Well, go ahead, boy, go ahead. How many fingers have I got up? Well, go ahead and hold some up, son, go ahead, hold 'em up. - Hold 'em up? - Sure. Sharp shooter, look, how many fingers have I got up? Well, now, don't tell me, don't tell me, let me guess. You got four. You're right, I thought you couldn't see. Well, certainly, son, you don't have to worry about me, son, now just put that cigarette in your mouth over there, that's it, now then I'll just stand over here and shoot that right... Now, look, I don't want these here people hooting and hollering at me. Hey, that's a king-size cigarette, boy. If I shoot that out of there, well, they'd think that wasn't a shot at all. We shortened that up a little bit too long. Yes, sir, they wouldn't think I was a good shot at all. No, they'd think you come from Oklahoma. What's that, son? Don't be sacrilegious and mention that name in my presence, boy. After all, I don't like that, now, don't do it, just stay... just keep away from that Oklahoma stuff. Yessiree, now, just hold that cigarette up there, boy, and I'll show ya... No, that's still too long, boy. We wanna show 'em a regular shot. I'll fix that thing up so these people know that they're really seeing something shooting out of your mouth there, now I'll shoot that out of there and nothing's left. No, uh I know, too long. That's right, now just hold it up there and I'll... hey, wait a minute, boy, don't do that, don't take the awning away, because that takes the shadow away and I can't see the cigarette. Yeah, but what happens to this? Don't worry about that, boy. The bullet will blow your nose. Now, just stand there, and I'll tell you what you do. Turn around and face me. -That's better, one... -Wait a minute! - What's the trouble now? - Turn around and face you? - This way, the bullets? - Look, boy, you're getting afraid now, don't be afraid. Remember the Alamo, son. Now, look here, all you got to do is, see, remember that cigarette there, the bullet hits the end of the cigarette, it goes down through there, and it gets to your lip, and it stops, then you spit it out. - Oh. - With your teeth. Go ahead, now, put it in your mouth, boy. Just stand over there, don't worry about anything. Everything... I tell you what you do. - Better put it in your ear. - In the ear? That's right, stick it right in your ear. -One... -Wait a minute! - What's the trouble now? - In my ear? - Sure. - Where's that bullet gonna go? Don't you worry, boy, there's a hole over here - on this side, isn't there? - I forgot about that. Sure, son. Wait a minute, wait a minute, what goes on in here? Uh, there's nothing to stop the bullet, there's nothing there, son, don't worry about that. You're right, there's nothing there. If there was, I wouldn't be taking this job. Don't worry about it, boy, everything is gonna be all right. Take that cigarette out and put it in your mouth. Put it right in your mouth, that's it, boy, get it right in your mouth there. That's the idea, now I'm gonna show you a good shot. I'm gonna show you one of the best shots that ever come out of that great state of Texas. And now, ladies and gentlemen, before I make this shot, I'd like to pause just long enough to say a few words about Texas. Well, I won't do that now, but I'll shoot that cigarette out of your mouth. I'm gonna show you one of the fastest shots ever staged before public. This is gonna be known as the Old Wild Bill Hickok Shot, son. This is the fast wheel, crow, and fire. Now, watch here, boy, I'm gonna show ya. I'm gonna see how ya... Son, you're the bravest man I ever saw. You stood there letting me shoot that cigarette out of your mouth, you never even blinked an eye. You didn't quiver a lip.
