July 1955. I was young, happy... ...in love with a dancer... ...who also loved me. Every night, my body caught fire on hers Before her, I'd only had two or three adventures. Thanks to her, I became a man. I liked kissing her on the tips of her breasts... ...even at the cinema. Long skirts and short hair will remain fashionable. Events in North Africa... The people of the Aures Mountains have won back the safe zones created to protect them against the Fellaga. Suspects arrested in the area are taken to assembly centres. Fellaga troops approached French lines. Among these men is a notorious leader of the Algerian rebellion, Aidouche, who will have to answer for his crimes. Such are the grim images that Algeria presents us today. Faced with these events... ...the government reaffirmed its desire... ...to put an end to terrorism and the opposing violent forces. She was beautiful, her name was Tania, and I was ready to marry her. But I hadn't done my military service. I didn't have a steady job. "Why waste your life getting married so young", my father used to say. Instead of a wife, have fun! Why get married at your age? I love her. So? You love your grandmother. Please, Dad. There are plenty of women... ...but you'd have to search to find a mother like yours. Do your military service, become rich and then we'll see. I came home every morning at dawn, on my scooter... ...proud to have been such a good lover. I realised later, that my eagerness to take her several times... ...had nothing whatever to do with the pleasure she deserved. But she was so happy to make me want her so much... ...with the pleasure that I had... ...that it mattered little to her as to what she got out of it. She really loved me. On morning as I arrived home from my darling... Here it is! This is it! I was eligible for service. It can't be possible… Mountain Infantry in Bourg-Saint-Maurice, Haute-Savoie. Your mother told me that you should be going into the air force. I thought you had connections! So did I. [A man who got a good job through connections only] I'm not asking you where you've been. Is it all over with the dancer? One lost, ten found. For once, you've spoken like a man. Why is it over? Arlette! Drink your coffee. You'll be late. You don't know anything about love. I'll show you what I know about love! Hello, Gerard? It's Claude. So much for your connections...! ...I've been called up to Alpine Infantry. Only yesterday, he confirmed that he'd done what was necessary. Must be a joke. Come and read my call-up notice, you'll see! I promise I'll fix it... Must be a mistake. -A fine example for your sister. I've other things on my mind. What? Think about your service first. Believe me, I'm thinking about it. How was it possible that I, Claude Langmann... ...son of Hirsch Langmann and Ava Beila Berkou... How was it possible, than a good boy like me... ...in 6 days time will find himself far from his family... ...away from the one he loved, away from it all... ...doing his military service... ...and on top of that, on skis? Don't worry, it'll be fine. Please, Arlette, leave me alone. You love her, eh? If you intend to eating at noon, you can come and give me a hand. I'm coming. And I'm waiting to replace Jean Marais. At the time... ...I was an actor and cap-maker. A rare combination. My ambition was to become a film-star. But in the meantime, I could, at no shame to myself... ...help out in the cap business. It was thanks to the caps, that we ate. Have you seen, the cap, the cap Father Bugeaud's cap - It was him. - It's her. It was my pal. We had a meeting with the string-puller... It was all set. I won't be long. She'll drive him crazy. What if he does love her? That's no reason to get married! Hello, Major? My regards. I have here, in front of me.... ...my young protege. Claude… Langsman. No, Langmann. Langmann. L-A-N-G-M-A-N-N. No, Landmann. L-A-N-D-M-A-N-N. - No, Langmann. L-A-N-G-A-M... M-A-N-N. - No, I was wrong again. It's Lang, L-A-N-G, like… George, M-A-N-N. The Major will see you. Thank you sir. It'll be fine. He got me a phone in a fortnight. His connections worked for him. Calm down, trust me. You're not married? No child? You are not the eldest of nine children? Did you lose anyone in the war? So what are you complaining about? Go skiing in Morocco or Algeria! Hello Bertrand? Bonnefoy Major here... At ease! Do you have in your social case files a Langmann? L-A-N-G-M-A-N-N. Thanks. I see so many social cases... ...that I don't remember if we studied yours. Are you an artist? Yes, Major. -Do you know Brigitte Bardot? B.B.? Yes, Major. Yes? Longman? L-O-N-G-M-A-N-N. Claude. 40b, rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, That you? Claude, that's me, 40b, rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière, it's me. but not Longmann. I'm Langmann. L-A-N.…. -Bring me the sheet. So just like that, you know Brigitte Bardot? B.B.? Yes, Major. Come in. At ease. Regards, Major. We looked into your case thoroughly, but with a typing error. There is an annotation of “Unknown”. Response from Civil Status. But it's no big deal... If you know Brigitte Bardot, it will be fine. I see that you wanted Air Force, stationed at Balard. Surely because of the direct subway. - Faubourg-Poissonniere station? - Good news, Major Charenton-Balard is the line. For the Air Force, it's too late. But if the anti-aircraft artillery, at Porte des Lilas, suits you... ...we can fix that. The metro is not direct, you need to change at... You must change… You have to change at… Invalides! Er… Republique! Anti-aircraft artillery is the opposite of aviation... ...but it's that or the Alpine Infantry. - So, good luck. - Thank you, Major. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, young man. And say hello to B.B.! Next time… - Do you know Bardot? - No, a friend of mine. Jean Louis. Claude! Claude! Another one! Another one! Porte des Lilas! It worked with your fixer. Tell me, Claude... Could you do something for my grandson? He's in Sidi Bel Abbes. I'll take a room at Porte des Lilas. 18 months will go quickly. Look how long we've known each other. A month. So, did you notice the time? No. 18 months, that's 18 times 1 month. It's nothing. Peanuts. Then we'll get married. Or even during it. Like that, you'll be sure to avoid Algeria. They don't send married men. The best would be that they send me to the Maghreb. You don't know Marrakesh? It's beautiful. Yeah? Aren't you hungry? Not eating your couscous? Before going, I spent the last days sleeping with Tania. I was feeling down. My parents, fearing my departure, even for Porte des Lilas... ...completely accepted that I didn't feel like working. I spent the last night at home. I didn't feel like making love. "War is war." The time has come. Stay brave, little Claude! Porte des Lilas isn't far. Give me a kiss. Have you thought of my grandson? It's done. Thank you, my little Claude. Thank you! Taxi! No, Dad! I'd rather go by subway... I'm in no hurry to get there. Excuse us... my son prefers to walk. He should know! I was doomed. I had to go. There shouldn't be too many. He left for Nantes... Had lost weight... 7 or 8 kilos. Completely desperate. You can't now... If you move, you make a hole. If it was possible, I'd have done his service in his place. Go and offer. Hello, my boy! How's it going? It's okay, I'm still in civvies. Nothing's happening, I just walk around the yard. Be careful. Don't be foolish. Present… arms! Order… arms! Where are you going? Should I take you? Don't you know whereat you're doing? Hop it! Go check over there! That's when I was sure that I was no longer free. I was made to feel like a rat. No more of my mum's good mash. In the afternoon, I was given my army wedding outfit. A 42 greatcoat that works! And the waiting resumed, interminably, in the yard. Gathering! All over there, behind! Assemble! Everyone back over there! Hurry up! Faster than that! You too! Get moving! Squeeze in the back! The married men, in line behind me! The others, into the trucks! Jump to it! Come on, get on with it! Come on, into the trucks, faster than that! Hurry up! - I have two children. - So what? I stay here? - You're married? - No. Get in the truck! - But I have two children! - I couldn't care less! Hurry up! Me too? If you're not married, yes! Where are we going? You'll see. Now we were in the countryside. Farewell to Porte des Lilas. I reread my guide... 409th AARA... Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, Porte des Lilas. So it could only be a mistake. I was taken by mistake. Where were you summoned to? Porte des Lilas? Me too. And you? Me too. - And you? - Yes Yes me too. Me too. It was a collective error. Especially if those in the other trucks... ...had received the same. A collective, collective error. Once to the left... ...wheel! Half step... Mark time! Section… halt! Order…arms! To the right… turn! Present…arms! For the two guards, at my command. Order…arms! Stand easy. Atten... shun! Present…arms! The two guards, at my command. Order…arms! Stand easy. Young men, welcome to the 409th AAR. Alas, it was not a mistake. I was indeed at the 409th AAR. This regiment had its headquarters at Porte des Lilas... ...but also a branch in Provins. I was there, 90 km from my mother, at the end of the world. I found myself in a room of 12, with 11 others. Want a slug? I hope you'll get packages. Is this your chick? This is mine. I have a pin in my knee. I hope to be discharged. It'd be bad for me, I wanted to join the paras. To each his own. Capital, by Marx. Is it good? This is the Bible of the 20th century. I don't really like priests. I don't want to be bothered. I'm not disturbing you? All right! When an NCO enters... ...the first to see him must shout "attention". For an officer, "Eyes front". If it's a senior officer, "Rank, eyes front". Understood? What a difference between the two officers? An officer trembles in front of a senior officer. That's the difference. My name is Ferracci. Chief Sergeant-Major Ferracci. Call me "Chief". I'm your section leader. I'm responsible for conducting your training. You'll get to know me. The big ones, I break in half. The little ones, I make taller. Don't play the fool with me, you're not sure of winning. Any questions? I have one. Who of you speak English? Do you speak it well? Not bad. Not bad, Chief. Chief. I'm Chief Sergeant Major. Not bad, Chief - Not badly or well? - Well, Chief. How do you say "WC" in English? - WC? - Water closet. The same thing, water closet. - Water closet, who? - Chief. Good. Go down the hallway and go to the WC. Inside you'll find a bucket and a mop. You'll clean the toilets on the right. It's 7pm. At 8pm, we must be able to picnic there. Understood? Get to it. I don't like boasters. You speak English? No, German. - What is it? - You're snoring! I snore? That's why you wake me up? Do it again and I'll kick your arse, understand? You're not gonna snore like that for 18 months! What's your problem? She wants children but no husband. - She's nuts. - No, she's not. I was sure she'd acknowledge the second one... ...but she did the same thing again. She acknowledged him before the birth. Legally, she has all the rights. Me, none. Shut it up a bit. We're here to sleep, after all. Here, have a drink. - What's that? - And that? That's it! Your oblong bed should look like a square. Why, Chief? That's how it is. I've made my bed square for 22 years... I never asked why. That's how it is, got it? Yes, Chief. Get to it. Have you made it square? I can't. How did you do it at home? My mother makes the beds. You should have brought her. I wish I could… - It's not complicated. - Not for you, Chief. Pull the blanket. So. You put your hand there, like that. So. How did you put on your gaiters? I don't know how. Look at mine! I'll never figure it. Sit down. So, what are you good at, apart from speaking English? Rank, eyes front! Keep your barber jokes. Come on, come in. Squeeze in. Come on! You, the lamb, go first. And a razor cut, one! Each of you will receive a rifle. You will keep this rifle, for the duration of your service. You will need to take great care of it. Like a pretty girl. More. A pretty girl, lose one, find ten. While if you lose your rifle... ...you don't want to know, believe me. Each rifle has its number. Each number has its rifle. Everyone will receive their gun with his number. Understood? Good. At the call of your name, take your rifle. Lambert. - 18023. Lambert, 18023. Brillac. - Here. 18029. Brillac, 18029. Mavout. - Here. 19035. Mavout, 19035. Sevestrier. - Here. - 17019. - Sevestrier, 17019. Marking. - 17014. - 17014, Marking. Who is Marking? It's me, Chief. Do you know what that costs? Slop…arms! AND HOP, AND HOP, AND HOP. Order…arms! I hear the butts banging... We're not moving until you get it right. Get the hell out of here! Atten... ...shun! Slop... ...arms! Present…arms! You'll get tired before I do. Order…arms! Atten... ...shun! [40mm anti-aircraft gun] Here is the firing action, the beginning of the recoil... the end of the recoil... the cartridge on the loading tray... cartridge enters the chamber... and the end of the cycle. The principle of this gun is simple. Its purpose is to send anti-aircraft shells in the air. Attention! Who shouted "attention"? Me, Chief. Why did you scream "attention"? You told us to shout… Not for a sergeant-major ...when a chief sergeant major is here. Your name? Fayot, Chief. For a month, you'll make my bed, polish my shoes... ...sweep my room. Understood? That'll teach not you to scream for a sergeant major... ...when a chief sergeant major is in the room. Sit down. Langmann, Lieutenant Casanova is asking for you. What could Lieutenant Casanova want? The commander of the 7th battery, to Private Langmann... ...commander of nothing at all? Come in. At ease. Leave us alone, Clochon. So close the door. Sit down, Langmann. Everything OK? Missing anything? A little freedom, of course, but it will come. In time, you'll have free time every evening to take a walk. And then later, you'll have your weekends... as the saying goes. To go to Paris, once or twice a month. And then some... but we can't favour everyone, Some will have a small diet favour. He wouldn't get to the point. I couldn't figure out where he was coming from. Was he gay? Had he taken a fancy to me? And why me? There were two hundred of us. That wasn't it. I read your… curriculum vitae. Your profession struck me. I love artists. I adore the theatre. Seven times, my wife and I saw Roger Nicolas... ...in "Baratin". That says something. And two years ago, we had a comedian here. A charming boy. You may know him, Francois Dupont. Yes I… He arranged regimental celebrations for us. His time went well. He was at home more often than at the barracks. But… ...he was a very resourceful boy. For Christmas, he succeeded in bringing to Provins… ...Jean-Marc Tennberg... ...who recited poems. Between us... "The Wolf and the Lamb…" splendid. Yes, it's very beautiful. He also put together an orchestra with other comrades. It was very entertaining. Of course, 2 years ago there weren't these events in North Africa... ...but there was Indochina. And then, events or no events, you have to have some fun. Raises the morale of the troops. I'm telling you all this now... ...in case you would like to take over from Francois Dupond. The regimental party falls on November 11. Until then, you have time. If… among your relationships... ...you knew some artists... ...who'd agree to participate... Preferably women. Jean-Marc Tennberg was very good... ..but for soldiers, women are much better. So... ...if you could handle this... ...you wouldn't be worse off here than elsewhere. Lieutenant, I know Brigitte Bardot. B.B.?! Wow…! And… ...you think she'd agree to come? I'm sure of it. Of course, Brigitte was very popular with the military. Your name is Claude. Between us, when we are alone... ...call me Paul. Have a refill? Slope... ...arms! Order…arms! Present…arms! If Brigitte Bardot saw you like this... She's coming to see me, Lieutenant. All that remained was to bring her. Did you do it to yourself? - No. - How do you know her? One can know her without that. We were taken to the rifle range to learn to shoot. I didn't like it because of the noise. And what's the use of learning to shoot if we don't intend to kill? - one - two - three - four - five - six In kneeling position. In position. For a five round shot, cock. On targets matching your numbers, start to fire. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Cease fire. Results. Not bad, yes. Did we distinguish ourselves, Fayot? - I have one, Chief. - I have two. You shoot better at the blank. Did you shoot? Yes, Chief, but I don't see them. Me neither. Four five.…. nine? Nine with five bullets? I don't deserve it, Chief. My mother has a shooting gallery the Trone Fairground. One, two, one, two, one, two. One, two, one, two, one, two. Ein, zwei, ein, zwel, ein, zwel. Now that you know how to use an anti-aircraft gun... ...I'll introduce you to the 12.7mm machine gun. Fayot... Why didn't you shout "Attention" for the NCO? Fifteen latrine duties. That'll teach you. Langmann, Lieutenant Casanova wants you. Come in. At ease. Leave us, Clochon. - Hello, Claude. - Good-morning Paul. - A little mint? - Thank you. So... Brigitte... when's she coming? It was getting serious. I wrote to my pal, who knew her... ...begging him to beg her to come to Provins. Who are you writing to? Bardot. When the first Saturday came, we were confined to barracks. For the first time, I washed my dirty laundry, away from my family. I had only one desire... to go out. See Tania again. Chief! Chief, can I talk to you man to man? Come on. Well, don't be shy... come and sit down. - Your place is impeccable, chief. - It's Fayot. Well? There you go, Chief. I wanted you… "Tu" me, my name is Angel. That's what I thought. Heaven sends it to me. Well, Angel, understand... I love a girl… Got it. You want to go AWOL and have me mark you present. - That's it, Chief. - Call me Angel. Come on, get going. Thank you, Angel. You're a Chief. Skates! How stupid. Come in. My respects, Major. We have a new recruit who knows Brigitte Bardot. Aha! And who could bring her for the regimental shindig. B.B.?! Where is this devil? The next day, there was no more Angel. Just a guardian angel. Hey, do you know Brigitte Bardot? - Yes why? - Otherwise you wouldn't be here. And I wouldn't have scored 8 days off. Get in there. Come on. Hurry up! You'll learn that in the army... ...it's better to pass for a fool than a know-all. I've got my eye on you! Don't worry, I'll get you out of here. Hi. - What did you do? - Went AWOL. It's nothing, you'll get a week. For me, it's more expensive. Abuse of a weapon, costs. You can lose your dignity but not your gun. Got a gasper? We're no worse off here than anywhere else. Who'd want the 40-hour week? I don't care. I knock over two villas a month... ...and then I'm free. What I liked above all, was the obstacle course. Come on! Langmann, do you need an elevator? Come on! Flat on the ground!... You'll know when the Fellagas are shooting at your bum. Go on. Come on! Come on! Follow on! Go on to the next one! Come on, artist! Me? No, my grandmother! At... ...ease - Private Arthur Mabot. - Here. - Private Jacques Marin. - Here. - Private Anatole Cukierman. - Here. - Private Michel Vombert. - Here. - Privates Bret. - Here. - Which of you two is Bret? - Me. Mr Claude Langmann. Here. There are no "Misters" here. Maybe it's B.B. writing to you. Yes sir. If it's her, I'll be a prize idiot. You must know her intimately, for her to write... "To Claude, my little private. His Bribri for life." Brigitte Bardot… I don't really know her intimately. It's a friend who knows her intimately. Don’t be modest, there's no shame in that. I can't believe it. May I show it to the Major? Of course, Paul. Have a Philip Morris... it'll put you off Troops. After a month, we were given free time until 9pm. - That's it for his Bardot. - She's changed a lot. We took a room at the hotel. But I was so tired... ...she spent the 3 hours we had together, watching me sleep. Dear Tanya. Every second Saturday, we had leave until midnight. My pals were having a blast. They get drunk and sing. Hey, you guys! Shut up! Mum! Look at your boy! Hey, that's not okay! Come back, Jerome! - Jerome! - Mum! Jerome... Hey, you guys...! Hey, Mum! Look how your son ended up! Slope... arms! Present... arms! Order... arms Slope... arms. Present... arms! What would Brigitte Bardot say, if she saw you present arms? - Shit. - What? I mean, "Shit, Chief." 15. You'll be killing your mother if you continue like this. I'm not doing it on purpose. I'm going crazy here. You need to calm down. Spades and master trumps. Had to play diamonds! Ladies and gentlemen, it's time. Give us another 10 minutes. Thanks. It's impossible. He shouldn't be there and the warrant officer's coming back. Excuse me, ma'am, I have to check. - It's food. - I have to see. It's OK. Come on... get up! - What's going on? - Out! Hurry up, get out! Hurry up! Come on, get outside! - We can't get a proper sleep. - You'll be able to sleep at home. - Wow, that's suspicious. - Come on, move it! - What's happening? - Leave... 48 hours before departure. Departure for what? Destination unknown. Mummy! The authorities comb the mountains... The number of skirmishes multiplies, increasing in violence. Faced with this resurgence of terrorism in Morocco... ...the government has decided to send reinforcements... ...including National Service troops. “Here, the first reinforcements arrive in Casablanca. The fight is on between France and the rebels. It's wonderful! You will see the country, the pretty fatmas! The brothels over there are different from the bars here. You have these 13-year old girls, it's wonderful. Young boys. If I was your age... I can't stop you from leaving, the orders are irrevocable. But write me from there, let me know where you are... I could keep you out of the desert. How's B.B.? Fine, thanks. -Come on, Langmann. Keep it. Thanks. Atten... ...shun! At ease! Attention! Present…arms! Provins to Casablanca in a DC3... Casablanca to Marrakech by truck. We were spoiled. The trip was well-organised. And despite the splendid landscape, those majestic palm trees... ...I couldn't stop dreaming again of the mirage of Porte des Lilacs. I didn't understand why France was so attached to its colonies... ...or why it relied on nice guys like us... ...to keep them for it. My battery failed in this fort, 90 km from Marrakesh... ...under the command of Lt Badepont... ...a Basque. We're not here to play Basque pelota! We're here for a grand mission of pacification. And your sister. We'll do everything so you have the same comfort, as in France. You'll have electricity. The proof... We already have the bulbs. Come on, hands up! Come on! Come on, get moving! Turn around! Hands in the air! Your hands, you! Turn around. Come on! Who is it? It's you, Chief. - Who's there? - Saponite, clean laundry. I'll leave you with the rebels. Where? What the fuck are we doing in this country? Come on. Come on. - Mum… - It's not your mum, it's your dad. Come on, stand up. Who's there? A guy who doesn't give a fuck about pacification. Nothing to report? - Apart from you, nothing, Chief. - Stay sharp. Come on in there, get up! It's time! Up! Come on! The day was breaking... the countryside was beautiful, ...when suddenly, I let out an animal howl. My rifle! My rifle... Oh no… No, not my rifle... My rifle... I'll never get out of this! My rifle! Leon! Leon! - They stole my rifle! - No? - I swear! - Where? He was there. I'm fucked... I'll never get out of this! Calm down, we'll find it. Leon, please, knock me out. You nuts? Make it look like they attacked me! - I can't do it! - Do it! - You're a stupid shit! - Do it! - No! - Do it! Do it! Do it! Come on! Is anyone missing? Yes, Chief. Langmann is missing. Where is he? Has anyone seen him? The first four... Come with me. Chief! Chief, he's here! A miracle! - Gosh! - A good start. Raise him carefully. Take it easy. I wonder who knocked him out. There's still a chance that your rifle wasn't stolen. If we stay here for months, I'll sleep while on watch. With the rifle between my legs. Then, if someone wants to steal it, he'll have to hit me first. We get attached. Amizmiz, October 15, 1955. My darling parents, above all, don't worry, everything's good. I have a morale of steel. The food is good, we eat couscous. I take good care of myself. I think of you. This is all going to pass quickly. Here, I better understand the trials that I made for you when I was little, and even big. But it's over. You will see, when I return, I'll be good. Now I understand. Life is a struggle. What if everyone had parents like you! Finally, things make sense. Next Sunday, I'm thinking of going to visit Marrakech. Not on the mouth! When you come to Paris, I'll introduce you to my mother. Good, you give money? - That's not what you want. - The money. It's poor Marquand's money. - There too. - Yes. - It's pretty. - You also. Thanks. Ah good? I'm going to eat, I'll be right back. All right? -Yes yes. - I will be back. - Yes goodbye. It was my only enjoyment of the night. Tired from my nights on duty, I must have fallen asleep... ...because the next morning... Langmann? Langmann? Are you alone? Are you alone? Yes! And you? Me too. -Leon? Leon, are you alone? Yeah. The sluts... they stole our dough and comics. We can't blame them. We could've stayed home. We're fair game. That's all we have left. That is, if you know how to catch them. At ease! As another distraction, we had cadet officer Toupet. He's a conscript, but his rank has turned his head. And instead of relieving us in exile, he relieved himself with his sadism... ...by making us do weapon handling in the sun. Inevitably, I was tired of this, as was Cukierman. You! Arms the right shoulder…! Present... arms! Cukierman! Would it tire you to raise your elbow? Get on your knees. Push that pebble with your nose. That'll teach you to lift your elbow! Do you refuse? Yes. You'll remember me. And how. We're not ready to forget you. Luckily, we were much happier in the company of Moroccans. Our mission of pacification is finished! In two days, we'll have left this fort. Leave the place clean. You'll fill in the latrines and be proud to go to the front. We went from pacification to repression, the normal way. The rebels were hidden in the Rif. As far as I was concerned, they could sleep in peace. We were being trucked on roads and then, suddenly, stop. We got off and ran up to see what was behind a hill. The enemy could be there. Personally, I've never met the enemy. Subsequently, some of us were left... ...all day, for observation. It was cheerful. Do you hear me? I hear nothing. Hello? Hello? Hello, this is B.B. Calling Albert. Hello? Do you hear me? I bought old plates and a nice sofa. You will see how happy I will make you. Six months have already passed. And in a year, we'll be together forever. I love you. I'll wait for you. Be brave. Come and eat while it's cold. In this hut where I lived for 2 months, I broke up with Tania. My darling, I know this letter is going to hurt you, but I have to write it to you. I do not have the right to ask you to wait for me anymore, alas. I love you, but I'm not sure I want to get married so soon. You must forget me. Thinking of you. One morning when we were sleeping very quietly... ...Chief woke us up to go in search of rebels... ...hidden in the area. You're going to war! Get up in there! Hurry up! The first one to lie down, was me, of course. It was an officer, who shot at a dog. He'd missed it, by the way. This is my whole war. In any case, this stay in the Rif... ...became a campaign, in my military record. So many nights under the stars, with or without stars. So many moonlit nights, with or without the moon. So much marching to nowhere, so many wasted days. Our only hope was the return of the King of Morocco. One day he came back. But not us. Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the king! What does it mean to yell that? Do you think we're going back to Paris? Algeria is waiting for us now. Believe me. Algeria, Morocco... they've had it. Our fine herd of colonies are mincemeat. We'll just keep Corsica. Maybe. Come on! Like to dance, Miss? I know how to talk to women! In Taza, distractions were numerous... billiards... ...ping-pong... ...ping-pong... ...billiards. Say, let's play ping-pong for change. At the municipal swimming pool, we could dress in civilian clothes. We weren't having a bad time, though. It's in Taza that the army gave me a job. You divide the bum into four squares. And you choose the top square depending on which buttock you prick. A little rap with the back of the hand... He thinks he's stung and contracts, then relaxes. And presto, you really sting him. - Understood? - Yes, doctor. I was hardly a qualified doctor, but I got it. You divide the bum into four squares… ...a little rap on the buttock with the back of the hand... The guy thinks he's stung and contracts, then relaxes... ...and bang! That's where it hurts. Watching over a dam... ...gave Toupet and myself the opportunity... ...to inaugurate our new relative positions. Him as head of section and me, as a medic. -Fayot, where are the others? - They're all sick. - Again? - What's wrong with you? - I'm sick. - And you? - Me too. - What's wrong with you? - You're not a doctor. - What do you have? - A pain. Exempt from guard duty. - A week. - Thank you. Next. What do you have? Sore feet. Remove your vest. Exempt from guard duty, 4 days. I was king in my infirmary. I injected, I bandaged, I dispensed. Who bothered me most of all, was my friend Toupet. - What did he give you? - One-week exemption. - And you? - Four days. He was tearing his hair out. I wanted to exempt him for baldness. He got angry! Everyone is exempt! No one stands guard! Those who are healed can have it canceled. What if it starts again? If there's a relapse… I wouldn't give a shit! You will stand guard tonight. Certainly not. Why? I'm officially exempted. Next! - What do you have? - Nothing. 3 weeks. Thank you Doctor. Here, sign this for me. Nurse Langmann... ...take advantage of his duties to exempt his comrades... ...as imaginary patients. Since the time he pissed me off, I had no more suspicions... ...I was sure of it. But I had a sense of nuance. Accused, I'd be asked for proofs. And apart from Cukierman's nose... ...I only had intuitions to offer him. I suspect Cadet Officer Toupet of anti-semitism. My little sentence found its way back to the Colonel... ...and my patients were recognized as ill. I was transferred to the Taza infirmary. Langmann. Do you really believe that I profess anti-Semitism? I believe him. They left me alone completely. As if the officers and NCOs had spread the word... "A dangerous soldier who reports on his superiors." I hadn't given up on my string-puller, nor had he forgotten me. He wrote to me asserting that he contacted the minister directly... ...through a friend of a friend of a 2nd cousin. After 14 months, I was entitled to a fortnight's leave. My ship! Luckily it wasn't mine. We took advantage of my leave to invite the major to my home. I was counting on stuffed carp from my mother... ...so the string-pulling would really work. It's a specialty of my wife. Stuffed carp. Oh? I hope you like it... it's sweet. Sweet carp? Yes, Polish style. It takes everything to make a world. You wouldn't have a steak, by any chance? Yes of course. Do you like it rare or medium? Well done. Like leather. My long habit of meals makes me like well-cooked meat. Because I haven't always been a minister. - Finally, to the ministry. - It's the same. Yes, well, it depends on the times. So, back to the case which interests us. To have our young friend transferred to Paris, requires a ministerial decision. And who signs this decision? It's not me. In ministry, what is there? There is a minister. You understand? And right now, the minister, ...is not me. And I don't always have the signature. You understand? If you'd come to see me 3 months ago... I saw you when you were a major. Before time, it's not time, after the hour, it's not the hour. What should be done? We're of two minds here. It's not the minister talking to you, this is a friendly advisory. There, you are in Paris. Yes, I'm on leave. Enjoy it. Break your arm. Or a leg. Or both, it's nothing. At the hospital, they save time... ...the ministry falls... and then, there... trust me. Get in line, my friend! -When I return from leave, I was entrusted... ...with the health surveillance of the CMB, Country Military Brothel... ...or prophylactic cabin. Three or four women, for everyone... But before reaching them... ...they passed by me. Marquand. Oh, the beautiful beast. He's good. It's good. Come on... your turn. Go to the next one. Hello, Ma'am. Come here, my little wolf. Come here. Yes. Where, ma'am? After a certain time... ...I got tired of inspecting all those bits of anatomy. I dressed in civvies to get some fresh air. My leave had given me back my taste for freedom. I wanted to see the sea. If you had fun, this is what it cost. This time, I was given 45 days. A wonderful stay. I became garbage man like my pals. Every morning, with a good-guy corporal... ...we picked up the trash throughout the barracks. The stop was longer in the kitchens. They were preparing steaks for us... ...that we wouldn't have swapped for anything. The jailbirds are here! Leon, steak! Come on, get moving! It doesn't take a lifetime. Take a look at that! Chow time... come on! Chow time! So, that's it... those steaks? There'll be something for everyone. Hey, guys...! Charity, ladies and gentlemen! - Hurry up! - Do you want it rare? Medium rare. Stop! It's good, eh? OK? He's always sulking, that one. Towards the end, from the coolness of my cell... ...I was entitled to something else. In August 1957, after 2 years in the army... ...they took me to the Algerian border, a few kilometers from Colomb-Bechar. After a month there, well tanned… Atten... shun! ...we were brought back to wait to be demobbed. By ministerial decision... ...class 551C... are sent back to their homes. Silence! Atten... shun! Private Langmann... step forward. 3 steps forward... March! By decision of the Chief of Staff, commanding the 409th AAR... ...because of your 68 days in prison... ...you are held in service for 21 days... ...as a disciplinary measure. Long live the Bretons! I don't understand anything! I did more prison time than you and I don't get held back. Ah yes, but you weren't a guy who had connections! My name is Ferracci. Chief Sergeant-Major Ferracci. Call me Chief. I'm your section leader. I'm responsible for conducting your training. You will get to know me. The big ones, I break in half. The little ones, I make taller. Don't play the fool with me, you're not sure of winning. Any questions? I have one. Who of you speak English? Me. - Do you speak it well? - Not bad. Why don't you re-enlist? You already have 2 years. In 23 years, it's retirement. For me, in 3 years, it's de-mob. And bingo, a cushy job with the cops. My little Claude! - It's all over? - Yes. - You're happy? - Yes! Has your grandson come home? Yes. He's here, you'll see him. Jules! Jules! Claude is back! Jules! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG We are very grateful to the Moroccan civil and military authorities for their support.
