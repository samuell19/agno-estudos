Where are you taking me? Where are we going? If you wanna stay here, I don't mind. What are you gonna do? Okay, okay... This is an exclusive room for the Japanese. Hi, I'm back. I brought the guy. Three guys are staying here now, including me. Hold it. From today, two hundred pesos for the first two months. After that, three hundred pesos as maintenance fee. - What, you charge for the room? - Of course. Reserved bed, free coffee and tea, plus Japanese papers and magazines. I don't think it's such a rip off. Hi everybody, we have a new comer today. Mr. Kohei Hayasake, give him a warm welcome please! He's been arrested for drug possession and is waiting for his trial... Let's all clap again! What's the stuff? Heroin. Heroin, huh. That's yours. What's wrong? Here, here, here, here... You are? Thank you. You, you, are you business man? I work for Sanyu Trading. Then, you won't be here too long. Really, you think so? Yeah, ambassador's gonna move their ass real hard for a guy like you. So, Kohei, how much heroin you got? I guess it's about a kilo. One kilogram? One kilo, one k.g, one kilogram! Your crime is really heavy, very heavy you know. Especially in the Philippines. Death sentence, happy, nice, long long, great! It's gonna be a long friendship. We should introduce one another. Death sentence? Death sentence! My name is Sakamoto, licensed doctor from Nagoya. My name is Umino. I own a restaurant in Manila. And the guy over there is Philippine Taro. He's got no real name, nothing, you know. One kilo. One k.g. Can you eat crow? Yep, it's not so bad. You'll get used to it soon. There are guns, drugs, even heroin... Really? Really. Do you know Brando? Yes. He is a con man. He bragged about office building projects, and ripped off Japanese business companies. No wonder. He's enjoying such a lovely life here. So, was your company ripped off, too? We sued him. What? That's awful! I got rice. Cook it over there. You can't even cook. Then, learn how to. You ain't a guest anymore. Here's a cooker. You'll get used to the water in a few days. Nerd studied too much, nerd studied too much! Shut it, punk! You're not even paying the fee, so behave! You're shitting the same stuff! That's mine! What are you doing? Kohei. This is your new lawyer, Sunny. Don't worry, I will get out of here. I'm not guilty. Then, why you? How come you always hire useless lawyers like this guy? You wanna stay here, like me? It's living hell, you know! Look at this. What is it? I know you're suffering. It's just company procedure to try anything. - Fuck company procedure! I just wanna shit! - Kohei! Just do something! Sir, have a seat. I have a message from Vice President Inagaki. He is believes in your innocence. I see. So, for the moment I'am taking over your position. What? That's why... That money... Haven't we agreed to spend the money Mascard wins on the next presidential election? The election is three months away. You think I won't be out of here by then? He's sick. There is no cure. He was arrested when he was raping a child at the hotel. What are you doing? He was even recording it on video. He's an excellent actor. But he surely gives a bad name to Japanese men. Come on. Come on! Come on. Good afternoon! I brought Hayasake. Hold on. Have a seat. Apple? Isn't it great? Shit! Belila is really not for you. I trust her taste. She's really good. She's got special technique, too. - He's Kohei Hayasake, arrested for... - I know. I'm Yoshida. Hayasake, sir. So, you won todays race? As I heard from an insider, the number one horse broke its leg. It happened right after the race, it's so obvious. So, what about this room? The rest is a hundred thousand peso and another hundred thousand for maintenance. I'am running a business out of this office. Hayasake, why don't you help my business. I will pay you. Business? I've been waiting for a guy like you. Trust is very important, in any business. Umino and myself don't look like business men at all. But you've got intelligence and manners. What do you think? I'm sorry but my trial isn't over yet and I won't be here too long, anyway. You think you'll get out so soon? Hayasake, don't think too seriously. When you are gonna get out we'll celebrate, no matter how soon. I'll propose another condition. What's that? I'll let you use my toilet. Your toilet? You can even flush it. What is he anyway? According to the rumours, he's kind of Mafia and... ...he ran off from the organization after killing a few gangs. So, then he asked to be sent to here. How come? To hide from his enemies. He's practicing a telephone conversation with his wife. But she won't answer easily... It's showers. You can clean up your body and clothes. It's finished. Finished. Kohei! Belila cleaned it for you fast, right? You make one put on such suits, who's the guest today? We are going out. Let's go! We are? You serious!? No client is gonna come to the prison. That's not what I mean. You didn't know? If you pay, anything's possible in there. That's why I work hard. Today's job is easy. Go to Malkind hotel, room 808. Give a white guy this brief case. He'll give you back same case. That's it? If you see a cop in the lobby, just ignore him. Behave normally, it'll be okay. What's in it? I'll tell you some other time... Here's ten thousand peso. Don't tell Umino I'm paying you four times as much as him. And next time you try to fuck me I'll kill you. Let's eat. Take me somewhere nice. Good! I don't know such a great restaurant in Manila. He went to Japan to make money ... ...and got his first job in Japanese restaurant, washing dishes. He learned how to cook Japanese fish there. With this kind of dish he could have a bigger place. He's not greedy enough. He always supports young girls like that. Hey, one take out bento box. I'll trust your choice of dish. Okay, leave it to me... Record high embezzlement of XX bank, behind the mask of suspect Namie Mishima. Isn't she a woman from the womens building? Kohei. You want your steak now? Steak? Oh, no. You're keeping your meat in here? I envy the life of a business man. No, it's not that. I'll save my meat for another time. My future. My dream is to become a comic artist... Because I like drawing. My father used to scold me, so I always hide... But someday, I wish that, someone... somewhere... will read my comic. Belila. I brought you back a souvenir. Saved me? I was paid to do so. By whom? The guy who made me steal the bank money. He told me to escape to the Philippines. And now I'm stuck here. It would've been better if I got caught in Japan. But, aren't you at least free here? Free? Aren't you already influenced by Yoshida? It's not the place for a human. Say, did you touch me before? No, I didn't. I thought you were better than the others but you seem a little dorky. No wonder Yoshida takes advantage of you... What do you mean? Yoshida and the warden are selling drugs together. What? Mr. Yoshida. Was that drugs in the brief case? You are really fond of young guys. If it was, so what? You know why I was sent here? It's no joke, I will never help your business again! Wanna eat bento box. It's not bad. Some extra underwear and shirts. It's not what I need. I need money! Got any money to get me out of here? It's impossible to make such a big amount of money so soon. What about our condo? We may have to sell it. Kohei, you are innocent aren't you? 'Course I am. Why'd you need to make so much money, then? Why do we have to sell our condo? You don't understand. In this country... It's you. You don't understand anything. My father has been transferred to a subsidiary because of you. He has? Doesn't anybody in this company trust me? Damn it, man, grow up! Where is the stuff? If you don't tell, you may get fired. If you leave it to me, I guarantee your freedom. I'am a very close friend of Manila's mayor's son. I played golf with him yesterday. There was a monkey island a long time ago. So, have your parents make a remittance. Fifty# thousand... no, thirty is okay. Wanna play ping-pong? For you, I will publicize all media to announce your innocence. Among my friends there is Tanaka Nakayama and Iwayama. He is an especially nice guy... ...and he established his own foundation, much to my surprise... You got any cigarettes? Got any small change? I give up. I really understand your feelings. I was just like you before. Intellectual people are not too strong. But, you have to be strong now. Let's put everything behind us tonight. Have some fun for a change. Are you really happy with your life? Life, huh. You guys are like human trash. Human trash? Well, human trash can sometimes feel really great. I'm no... trash. Don't think of me as one of you. I will win the case and pay back my company. I'm no trash. Human trash, sometimes I really feel like that. Bottle me up! I'm gonna be a president one day and put every human trash on death row! I'm feeling really good, Sakamoto. Kohei, I will make it easy for you. It won't take long. Mr. Yoshida! Hayasake. If you help my business, I will save you life. All right, I accept. Sakamoto, return your money. You tried to kill me for twenty thousand pesos. You were gonna buy some girls with that money, weren't you? You should try the taste once. How beautiful and unforgettable those girls bodies are. I'm sure you won't forget such a taste. You sick pervert! You're such a bastard! I'm a sick bastard anyway! I haven't a cure for it! Stop it, guys. Some guys get killed for five thousand pesos. If your price is twenty, it's price for an elite. I have a question for you. Tell me, honestly. What's that? The guys who buy women are real respectful ones? Those guys that look down on poor people are real respectful ones? Those guys that leave you behind are real respectful ones? I didn't leave you behind. Don't rely on people outside. They won't understand your feelings. We are the only ones that can share your feelings. Let's go home. Can you excuse us? Sure. Miyuki, do me a favor. What is it? I'am keeping bribe money to give to presidential rock date. I want you to go and get it for me. I can't trust my company anymore. How much is it? One million dollars. Go by yourself. If my company finds it first, I'm finished. Excuse me. I'm Mrs. Hayasake. I'm here to pick up something he asked you to keep. We are on behalf of Haysake. We want it back now. It's Kohei. He wants to speak to you, mister. Hello, sir. It's Sugimori. No, don't get the wrong idea. Your wife asked me to come with her. Sugimori, sorry but there is no money in there. I'm taking it as compensation money. If you wanna sue me, go ahead. If so, I might as well tell the public what is behind this money. And tell Miyuki that I don't want anything from her. Kohei! Don't mind, man. Double crossing each other and that's what husband and wife are like... You know, you understand? I'am even worse. My ex wife was horrible. So, I took the money away and ran off with a young Philippine wife. My family business went bankrupt because of me. Nice guy! Philippine is so cute. I love her, I need her, I want her... I'am serious, so you're gonna be okay, too. Let's go karaoke! Yeah. Murakami! Fuck! Bastard! Yoshida. It's not looking good! He must've run away with the money. Did he really run away? I don't buy that. Besides, you wouldn't let him go so easily. Yoshida. It's really shitty! What happened there? Nothing happened. I don't know. I really don't know. It doesn't matter. Hayasake has his way, and we have ours. Hayasake, hey, wanna tell us something? Where have you been? I couldn't find a ride back here any sooner. We thought you'd took off. I don't have the guts. What's that? Don't, it's okay now. Good job, Hayasake. Hold it! Belila... Belila... Today, Manila is like a hell. The blackout hasn't been fixed yet. It's gonna rot, sooner or later. What a fool. She didn't die for a guy like me. She was a good girl. She was willing to die for you. Kohei. I didn't mean to leave you. It's okay. I'm used to it. Don't blame me, somebody is after me. That's because you messed up with those Mafia guys. Why do you know that? I bet your ex-criminal story is made up. You are just a cheap con-man, Murakami Those guys after you are from Osaka, aren't they? Right. But the job I agreed to was offered by them. I was set up. They want you dead. It was my biggest con ever. I would've been on some tropical coast after I finished that job. It's so miserable to get betrayed. Are you gonna tell everybody about me? No, I won't. If I hadn't met you I was a dead man. I'd have hung myself. I bet you wouldn't. You're not that soft. That Japanese guy at the hotel sent the guard to shoot you? Yeah. I found two hundred thousand in his pocket. That's about eight thousand pesos. You are quite an elite... Now they know I'm here. In just a matter of time they will come here and get me. What're you gonna do? We better run away... Is that possible? Yes. With money, anything is possible. It will go rotten. Kohei's meat, too. Shall we cook it and bring it over? Let's do that! Taro, Taro, are you okay? Taro, hold on! Warden! It's a riot! They're killing the Japanese! We better run as far as possible. Then what? Then we'll get out of the country. Out of the county? How? I don't think your money is coming back. I've got money. How much? One million dollars. Really? You mean that? Don't worry. We won't leave you behind. Hayasake, can I ask you something? I wanna take my wife with me. Sure. Thank you. I'm picking up my wife right away. If there were no blackout... Don't blame it on blackout. We wouldn't be here without that. Our lives are worth one million dollars. How about that? Exchange rate is about one hundred and thirty yen per dollar. That's about it. What're we gonna do? Let's eat first. How are we gonna run away without money? Some people get one million in life through pure luck. It could happen to us! Are you serious? Kohei. What're you gonna do? If we can't stop, we only have one choice. That's what I think. Hey. What? What is it? It's just between you and me. I hid jewelry here. It's worth twenty million yen. Please escape with me. So, you gonna screw other guys? You will get screwed someday. Nobody's sane, anyway. Are you okay to always be screwed? It's better to be screwed than to screw others. You're so stupid. Yeah, I am. Stupid. When I got caught for that case, I swore not to fall for a guy again. I swore to myself. But, I... I won't betray you. Sky is blue when I cut seaweed and it's beautiful, beautiful... It's salty, but tastes good! Go go go, good good good! I wanna go back to Japan... What the hell!? What's wrong? Sakamoto, don't abandon her. Save her life. You can't let her sister be alone. I know, I know, but I need more light. Can you get me some light? Umino is trying, but I don't think it's gonna work. I found this, hope it helps. Then, I can't use any pain killer. - There must be a medical chart around. Get it for me! Found it! Blood type O. Anybody have the same type? I think Kohei's is better. If mine ain't no good, Kohei's ain't no good, either. - It came back! - Ouch! Shall we begin. Sakamoto is really a doctor. He's been taking patients since this morning. Taro is realised as a living god by the people of the village. I must now fix the electricity, too. Business man and con-man are both really useless. Yamashita? Yamashita? I am Yabumoto. Murakami, come out! You rotten bastard! Or we'll shoot them all! Come on out! Murakami! Come on you bastard! No, you'll get killed! No! Japanese, aren't you? How come you understood what I said? You bastard! Sakamoto! Where is Murakami? I don't know such a person. Then I don't need you. I will give you one more chance. Where is he? I don't know! Yabumoto! Murakami. It's Murakami. It's him indeed. This is enough. You only want me, don't you. Shut the fuck up, bastard. I can't just back off halfway. Just shoot me! Then, we'll kill you all and send your bodies back to prison. Wait! Hold it! One... after another! Wait, don't kill me. I've got twenty million worth of diamonds. This is yours. I will do anything for you. I don't want to get involved with you anymore. Please, don't kill me. Do you know what is most beautiful about her? It's the eyes, her eyes; beautiful shining eyes. Those eyes, they never betray you... They never betray me, never... Understand? Understand? ...Understand? What the hell? Never betray me, never! Never! They will never forget about Sakamoto. What're you gonna do, guys? Are you staying here with Taro? I'am going back to prison. Prison? You don't have money anymore. I'm gonna start from scratch. No kidding! I'm going... But I don't regret that we have met. Keep it. Bye, Taro. Take care. See you... Kohei! Banzai!! Taro. Hey! You guys... I'm so worried about the two of you. You can't do anything without me anymore. Don't make me worry too much. I agree... It is Philippines presidential rock... Hayasake, senpai? Hey, look! He's the new Philippines president, Mabini, isn't he...!? Why don't you go to Pachinko, or something? Let's move on together!. The future is near... Legendary Philippine Taro is dedicating the gold mine he found... And he is now truly recognised as a living god in the village...
