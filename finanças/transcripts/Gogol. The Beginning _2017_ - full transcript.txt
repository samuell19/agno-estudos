So, this Miss Atashinskaya was going to marry the merchant Kerenina. This man had connections. He got to the governor this morning, for help to resolve this case. The murder and theft are clearly the work of the Klimovskys, They got in, strangled her, forced the safe and stole the money, Let's organize some descents to get hold of the assassin, Maybe they’ll hand over the killer.

I loved her more than my own life. And she loved me too. So why marry another? If everything was so good with you? She no longer had a penny, There was no money anymore.

And what kind of fainting did he have? You know, it turns him off periodically. Over time and more often. Is this afraid of blood? Somehow... I can't understand. Sometimes there is no blood, but he still falls. If it is murder, then he surely always does. And if it is a simple case? Well, if something is just stealing or a domestic brawl, he doesn’t fall at all. And he writes always something, during these absences? Yes? In general, yes. His hand moves with the pen over the paper. Usually nothing is clear. Not clear, huh? Or just you can't read it. Yes? Kovleysky? Greetings at home. Hans Küchelgarten Masterpiece by M. Alov.

Some like you, they cut off their tongues. I will sell you and I will redeem you without a tongue, understand? It will not work for you to redeem me. Because you don't have any money left. You will have spent everything in your books, Nikolai Vasilievich. Yakim, Crimean Tatars! I am silent. I am silent. Poltava Mirgorod The lived is only small wood for the writer. It disappears in writing, like these books, The more suffering, and frustration, the better the writer. So don't be upset Nikolai Vasilievich. The best is yet to come,. I'm sorry to arise like this without warning. Today I’m leaving, perhaps for a long time. I was passing by, and I took advantage of it, I come to say you. I was very pleased to meet and to work with you. Although briefly. Thank you. I AM... I have heard a lot about you. That you are... an investigator, able to reveal the most difficult cases. So people say. Well yes. I have the honor. Wait! What? Where are you going? In the Poltava province. I have an urgent business there, something tells me - one of the most interesting all my service. You are surely there need a writer. Take me with you. Are you sure ? Can you handle it? You know, the case is complicated, and the journey is long, And then, there are your... fainting ... Yes, I'm sure I can handle it. Especially me. I was born in these places. I can be useful to you. Well, look Gogol. You have five minutes to get ready. Near the village of Dikanka the bodies of young women were found. Three bodies, to date. Do you think you will find more? And the killings are likely to have a ritual character. The local population, as you know, is poorly educated, and therefore superstitious. There are rumors of Gypsies, evil spirits, masonic conspiracy... But of course, we Muscovites will also accused this cannot be avoided. We need to catch the killer as soon as possible. Or the killers. Mirgorod Poltava How did you sleep? We are almost there, Village of Dikanka Well, that's what I was afraid of. Yakov Petrovich, bread and salt! Bread and salt! We would prefer bacon and borscht, Of course. Come to my home. Everything is on the table, the meal is hot. Come on, come on. You will stay with me, And who are you, my dear? Alexander Khristoforovich Bing, Head of the local police department... And this ... However, come to me, there you'll meet everyone. Do not consider it disrespectful, but we prefer to stay at the hostel, We are so used to it. Of course. Well, where's the girl? Frankly, we hadn't thought about it, but... it can be arranged. Alexander Khristoforovich, where is the murdered girl? There was a message to not bury the body, to keep it on ice until the arrival of the inquiry officer. Is not a Christian. What would the family have said? Yes, and who would agree to keep a corpse in his cooler? Yakov Petrovich, we do the same work. We need the locals of the region, to worry less. Our job Alexander Khristoforovich, is to catch the murderer as soon as possible, Today we are going to exhume the body. Do you want to dig? How to dig it out? Usually, father, with a shovel. How else? Your soil is good - loam. So it will not take much time. All-Merciful Mother of God ... This is understood, He refused to let me house him, Is he seeking under us? Why does he need us? We are small people. Who knows what he will discover? "A pig has a nose for mire," Follow me. Don't worry. We do not have bed bugs. Well, almost. No more than elsewhere, that's for sure.. Get comfortable, Yours is at the end of the corridor. How about lunch, Nikolai Vasilievich? I am so hungry. I walked past the kitchen. There is quite a choice! There are Pies, dumplings, donuts and many more! Nikolai Vasilievich, it already rustled inside me. According to reports, there was a rider nearby of all crime scenes. On a black horse. Moreover, everyone describes it in approximately the same way and everyone calls it evil spirit. That's it, dear Nikolai Vasilievich. Always the farther from the capital we get the more superstitious the people are, What's the point? to kill these girls? Some kind of degenerate who probably just enjoys it... How often have you encountered such type of person ? Not especially though. Some time ago I had an funny case. From a Registrar College someone stole his overcoat, suddenly began to kill and gut people. Not just people, but officials. Not lower than at least advisers. Can you imagine? He killed them and gutted them. He was taking their organs, grilled them and ate them, Nikolai Vasilievich, a large slice or a small slice? A small. What is this house over there? The Danishevskys live there. He is not local and rarely seen in public. He only comes out on rare occasions, Well, we don’t have a morgue here. We have prepared a barn for you. So so so... What are you going to tell us about, beautiful? Over the girl’s chest is a small incision made with a sharp object. The cut was shallow and cannot be the cause of death. So, now the fun part. YES! The aorta is cut. And it seems by a professional. A doctor... or a butcher. How are you, Nikolai Vasilievich? Great, Yakov Petrovich. Wonderful! Most impressive, it's the complete absence of blood, I congratulate you. Today without fainting. I am doing my best. Even if you don't look good. Never mind. Listen, how about a drink? Thank you for now, but... If you don’t need me anymore, I'd like to take a walk. Take a walk. You? It's me, I am not sleeping? As far as I know, no. I can pinch you if you want. Where am I? How did I get here? Our horses knocked you over, The coachman tried to alerted you, but you didn’t seem to hear him. Alexey and I brought you here. You have delirize all the way. Sometimes even in verses. About a certain Louisa. Is she your girl? No no. This is the heroine of a terrible one Poem that you will not read or will never read, thank God. How is he? He talks about poetry, Excellent! So he's better, Danishevsky. Alexey. I see you already met my wife? You introduced yourself to our dear guest? Lisa. Nikolay. Yes, these killings ... Everyone is talking about these murders. And what do they say? Well... No one really knows anything. But everyone has his own version, of course. Opportunities to be entertained are rare in the region, The local landowners have two passions, drink and boast. And fasten the population. Try the quail. And what has... brought you here? My uncle... The most honest man. I have not read the rules. Alyosha wants to say that he inherited the mansion from his uncle. Yes. We thought we would settle the formalities and return to St. Petersburg. But stuck, so to speak, by the picturesque region. Lisa! What's wrong with you? Do you feel bad? No no. I'm just tired. Lisa, did you forget? Forgive me, Nikolai. Don't worry. She just has to take regular treatment. The female body is weak. Have some wine. Thank you. I have to go. I'll give you a horse. Do you know how to ride a horse? Get over there! Come! Horse, let's go! Who are you? Oksana, the miller's daughter. How did you end up here? The horseman who kills people, he chased after me! Black, eyes glow ... In the woods ... No one is chasing you, How is it not chasing? I saw him, he is real, he ... Come on. - Where? You warm up, I'll make you some tea, Thank you. Aren't you afraid here? Afraid of what ? About the murders? Didn't you hear about them? Three young girls were this days... Killed! More. What are you saying? More were killed. A lot more... Were killed. How much?! You seem to know something about this. Right? Tell me. Get some sleep, Soon you will know everything. Everything in its time. So her name was Oksana? Ghana, the light of my eyes. I will ask you something. is there a lake and a windmill over here? Not for a long time. Yakov Petrovich, I don't know maybe I imagined it. Sometimes the difference between dream and reality is very small. And for an impressionable nature like you, I'm afraid that makes no difference at all. From the point of view, let's say, of the writer it would not be bad. But from the point of view of the investigation, we will see. Well, Nikolai Vasilievich, let's go. Where? To the mill. That was thirty years ago. There is nothing left of the mill. Only stones. What do you hope to find there? So, Mr, Assistant. Are you satisfied with it? Did you like the walk? The girl was here. Said she is the miller’s daughter. And the mill was intact. It's my coat! I lost it here, So you... You say, this is where you saw the miller's daughter? And her name was Oksana? Yes. Lord have mercy... How do you know her? Everyone knows it. It happened 30 years ago. Well, they say there was a beautiful girl. Until she drowns, Then her father went crazy and hanged himself. Only the stepmother left at all. It was a very sad summer. Tesak, what are you talking about? How could it have been the miller's daughter who drowned 30 years ago? Yakov Petrovich what? Your assistant can resurrect the dead? The abilities of Nikolai Vasilievich may be beyond your understanding. Well yes, yes. So, then disappeared a few more girls. About a dozen. You mean... You say that the county already had similar crimes here? And you remain silent? Do you even think what you are doing? Do you even understand why I'm here? Or are you intentionally hiding these crimes? Yakov Petrovich, I would appreciate... I would appreciate you answer my question! My duty is to prevent ridiculous rumors to spread, It is impossible these murders to be linked. Our murderer should not... not have even be born at that time. The devil kills them. And the devil has no age. Now, without you and your Oksana, Alexander Khristoforovich would have hid these killings thirty years ago. Say, do you remember all the details of your night walk? I remember everything but maybe it was a vision anyway? Yakov Petrovich, do you know a good doctor in Saint Petersburg? I need a good psychiatrist. Why? - I'm going crazy, Nikolai Vasilievich, we are looking for the truth. And there are only two ways to do this. The one who leads us there and the other who takes us away from it. No need to consult a doctor now. Nikolai Vasilievich! Lisa? Thank God you are all right. Yes, all is well. How do you know... The horse that Lesha gave you came back covered in thorns and scratches, I worried so much... Yes? Yakov Petrovich, meet... "Houses, gardens. Everything is visible, everything is light. All in gold the bell tower shines. And the ray shines on an old fence. Everything was captivatingly turned upside down in silver water. Fences, a house and a little garden in it. everything is moving in the silver water. The vault turns blue. and the waves of the clouds go. Your poems? Do not dare to lie. Alov! Is that you? Yes. But... But how did you get it... Lesha and I read a lot of books. When you raved, it seemed familiar to me. I have read your Hans Küchelgarten , So you're a poet, Nikolai Vasilievich? And I thought I burned all the copies. Never do that again. You are only an instrument in the hands of God who speaks to us through you. Your books do not belong to you. And you do not dare to burn them. Promise you will never do it again. It's just... Just promise! Very good, I promise. That's better. Maybe stay in our area will give you food for a new creation. Yakim! - Yes? I've been lately rude to you.... Lately ? When I cradled you in my arms, you were good to me, Since then, no longer a nice word, What a grumble you are, Yakim. Grumbling and grumbling Have you met a girl? That's good. At least we have not come in vain. What are you talking about ? We have a Platonic relationship. We are... friends. But of course, master! I made children all over Russia, with platonic relationships. Enough to populate three villages, Yakim! Go to sleep. And your vulgar stories. Keep it with you. Of course, as always ... My stories are vulgar and should listen to yours. What are you doing? - I dig a hole ... What are you digging a hole for? - To find the money. What do you want money for? - To buy needle. Why a needle?? Help me! How? You can see what others do not see. Who are you. And where am I? I know you're looking for a black rider who murders young women. I will help you if you help me. But how can I help? Help me to take revenge on my stepmother. Every night she appears in my lake, pretending to be a mermaid. She sucks the power from me and my sisters. She did a lot of evil to me. Look into my face. His spells have taken away the color of my cheeks, Look at my neck, She marked him with her iron claws. Forever. Look at my eyes. They are blinded by tears. What can I do? You can see. Look! She is among them, She hides, but she is among them, Raven, raven, what are you doing? I'm digging a hole, What are you digging a hole for? - To find the money. What do you want money for? - To buy a needle. What do you need needles for? - To sew the bag.. Why a bag? To buy salt. Why do you need the salt? To salt the cabbage soup.. Why do you need the cabbage soup? To pour it in the eyes of your children, Ghana? Yes, Nikolai Vasilievich. I think I’ve done something stupid. when I agreed to come with you here. I didn’t even have time for breakfast. A good Breakfast is the Foundation of a healthy diet. A healthy diet is the foundation of longevity. So here, you say, she was torn apart? Ghana, wait a minute! It's all because of you. Dana, I don't understand... What are you speaking about? For the love of God, what's wrong with you? What are you doing? You ruined everything. What are you getting into? What a passage, gentlemen. Incomprehensible powders. Witchcraft, it seems. - Are you okay? As you can see. - Very good, The dagger is small, Damascus steel. Probably, the murder weapon. I found the same sign wherever the girls were killed. Look at this. I never would have thought that the killer is a woman. I thought he should have tremendous power. She possessed, I assure you. Well, in any case, it seems to me everything worked out perfectly? Yakov Petrovich caught the killer with our help. The killer resisted and ...died. The report will turn out beautiful. For the occasion, offer you to dinner at my house. To tell the truth, I have little appetite, Tomorrow we go to St. Petersburg. I only want to sleep, No offense, Alexander Khristoforovich. I understand. Lisa? I was told that you are leaving tomorrow. I had to say goodbye to you, I will miss you, And me too. Lisa. And... And you, and ... and these places and the air... But you didn’t catch the killer. The black horseman continues to kill. Wake up, or you're going to burn alive. Yakov Petrovich! Do not go, you will die! Yakov Petrovich! It is impossible! It is impossible! Take the body Yakov Petrovich back. There is not much left, but better bury people in their homes. I won’t go anywhere. What? The real killer has not yet been found. His remains were not found in the house. Ghana was only the accomplice of the killer. Until a new investigator arrives from St. Petersburg, I will replace Yakov Petrovich. And this is my decision. I respect your wish to be useful, but you are an educated man, so you will understand, Yakov Petrovich was a great man, a legend, and you... What can you do? You're just a paper scraper, Enough, Mr. College Secretary. View the things like the Germans Be realistic. You have nothing more to do here. If you have any objections, write to the third section. But please, Alexander Khristoforovich give a detailed account... of all what happened. We must find the killer together with you. The real killer... Or killers. Yakim, unload our things! Nikolay Vasilievich, Unload! Well, as you order. No no. This is all he, this writer. I don’t know from where he could discovered everything. Something is not right with him, I haven’t met such people yet. He has some strange power. Dark powers from a dark source. How could I know! No, please! Don't! GOGOL Chapter 2 The red kerchief A few days later Come here ! Over here, quickly! However, Khavronya Nikiforovna, my heart desires something softer than your pies and cakes. I have no idea what you're talking about, About what? Your love, of course. God knows what you are up to. A little more, and you will kiss... We were caught! Who's there? Get dressed, come on! Get out thru the stove. Who was it? - So who was it? - Nobody, - And what's that? - Like a jacket. A red jacket! It's nothing, Khavronya Nikiforovna. There are naughty children. Oh, this is bad. So they know! If they tell your husband... So you already sniffed about Popovich? Not sniffed. But found out. And now I would like to hear the details. Please. Last night the local woman Khavronya was stabbed to death. Right in her house. And on the stove was a sign drawn. exactly the same as your murderer horseman left. There he is. We brought you a criminal on a Saxon saucer. Please, interrogate. A jacket! Red. On the porch ... What jacket? Any child will tell you this. This is a damn mark. Unfaithful women fear it more than death, Damn bastards toss a jacket in front of the door. Consider everything, the right sign, that he will come soon. The Candle... start fading green. Then the pork snout. The hellish devilish snout It was taking up the whole room! Alexander Khristoforovich, you really believe that Popovich is the rider who killed three girls, a woman and Yakov Petrovich?! Listen to me carefully, You are the investigator, Investigate! Find me the real killer. I will make sure let him get what he deserves, First of all, i need to inspect the house of the late Khavronya and I still need a draftsman. Who? An artist? Which will sketch everything what I will indicate. Of course. And a sculptor who will sculpt everything, Paraska... Witch! Here is the blacksmith, Hello, Vakula. Long live and healthy. Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol. Our new interrogator. Came from St. Petersburg. In order to investigate the murder of the girls. Did you draw this? Well, I. I should have covered them long ago. I never had time. The police. Your assistance is required. More precisely, your talent as a artist. - I don't do this anymore. Look for someone else. Understand me, this is very important, We are looking for a rider who kills innocent girls. And eh... And you have the opportunity to help us out. Your horseman - it is an evil force. The devil is his servant, I will not get involved, so do the same, Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Dad, Tyat, Marushka wants to tell you something. But she is shy, Maruska, tell me what do you want from dad? Maruska wants earrings like the stars in the sky. You can do that ? Go inside, daughter. We'll talk later. Good dad. Goodbye. If we don't stop the rider, he will come soon for your daughter too. Rest, O Lord, to the soul of your servant Khavronya, in your kingdom free from pain and suffering, In your kindness and your love for all men, forgive her all sins that she may have committed, have mercy and take her in your Kingdom of heaven and help us to sacrifice our souls to do good works. Hello, good people. This is the investigator from St. Petersburg. So, father, the burial must therefore be wait. Until... The investigator has finish his investigation. Well, tell me where was the body found? Here where you stand. Gritsko and I drank in the pub. He asked my daughter to marry. Then I came home and... Thank God, my daughter Paraska was out with friends. She has not seen this obscenity. Excuse me, excuse me. Where is the sign, that the murderer painted on the oven? I was where you stand. We covered up this devilry. Why did you do this? What is covered can be discovered. Is there vinegar in the house? With God's help it will work. Lord, save us! Nikolay Vasilievich... - Quiet, Quiet! What kind of tree is it? You draw is even worse that you are investigating, It looks like an oak tree. But I could be wrong. It is for sure a linden tree. The same that grew on our property. The little ones loved to sit on the grass under it. A tree... A forest... Why is it necessary to get the trunk in the yard? And why did you decide to search Cherevik’s house? Because Khavronya was not killed by the rider. Not the rider? And the sign? - The sign proves nothing. Besides, it was not drawn properly. The symbol inside the horseshoe was upside down. The horseman always killed young girls. and then suddenly he decided to kill Khavronya? The horseman always killed in the forest, and then suddenly a murder in a haus? Come to the point. The conclusion is simple. Everything is staged, Some one had done this to lay the blame on the horseman. And this someone is Cherevik? Yes, it is he. Cherevik decided to take revenge on his unfaithful wife, While her daughter was out with friends, he came home, left a red jacket and killed Khavronya, And then we were sent on a false trail. For Cherevik, this is all too tricky. Alexander Khristoforovich! This I have found under the tub. We are holding you, my good fellow, You painted the sign on the stove! - Well seen... - I didn't kill her! I already told you that we were in the pub. Gritsko will confirm this, If Gritsko does it, then it's because he covers you. He will end up at a labor camp with you. Nobody will see you again. You won't have a son-in-law or grandchildren. Have mercy! No mercy! For Gritsko there is hope. But only if you confess everything to me. Then you will go alone to a labor camp. Well? Think, on Solopy. Do not spoil the life of your daughter. Why deprive her of the groom? Why deny it? I killed her. This traitor has worn me that she was cheating on me and I killed her. Do not touch Gritsko. He didn't know. Well, that's nice. So let's write it down. What about the candle? My daughter Paraska bought them on the market in Poltava from Gypsies. She said to decorate the house. Nikolay Vasilievich! You're constantly in the way. You should leave. I have only one request, before you send me to the labor camp... let me celebrate Paraska's wedding today. It's my only chance to see her get married. This special day the autumn equinox. I would sit at the wedding under your supervision. It's finish, he signed and admitted everything, It was not him, It is necessary to perform an autopsy of the deceased. How is it not him? Your self has raised suspicion of Cherevik. And that the rider had nothing to do with the murder, with the murder of Khavronya. So... Get back to your investigation. This is my business. Come on, wait! Work together, damn it! Put it there. Mr. Investigator, Where you want the doctor? What does "where" mean? You asked for a doctor, There he is, Womgard Leopold Leopoldovich. - Is he drunk or something? - Yes. He does not stand well, But he can still cut in this state... Here you pour him, if he starts falling asleep. Don't overdo it. Will you drink? Dear Gogol, you look bad. Drink, it will become easier for you. I know by myself. Thank you. Superficial injury. Light pierced. With such a wound she would still have lived two days. So from what is she died? Here it is: Her little heart. Come and see this. Here's a curiosity. A Point outpouring of blood. The poor... Her eyes ... Before she dies. Went wide. ligaments in the throat ripped off as she screamed heart and long. Heartbreak! You want to say that she died because of fear? And you, it turns out, are versed in medicine. Okay I was... I was the best at the university. I even wrote a thesis, That's why they sent me here in exile, I'm wasting away here, all alone, Keep me informed if you find other bodies, Anything is better than sitting without work. Nikolay Vasilievich, Listen to me. You are a true master of your craft! I'm at your service. You have to close the door, or goats and chickens will come in. Nikolai... Vasilievich... Lisa... Nikolai Vasilievich. What are you doing here? Elizaveta Andreevna ... You... Sorry... I wanted with you to talk. It's a little late to visit me. Let's call it a night meeting. What do you want to talk about? Excuse me, but I have a stupid question. Would you happen to me… visited? The night before yesterday? I don't have a habit of applying visits at night. Especially not young men. I am... re-reading your Küchelgarten. Why are you reading this nonsense? Why are you so ashamed of your work? I'm ashamed - is too weak as term. Can you imagine - When I was in St. Petersburg, I went to see Mr. Pushkin, himself. I wanted to show this kind of trash to this great poet. And what did Alexander Sergeyevich say about your work? Glory to you, Lord, nothing. Alexander Sergeevich played cards all night and he was not able to receive visitors. When I think about it ... What if he accepted me? And you know what? It's my - worst nightmare. See, you write about Germany. You Write very beautifully. but maybe you should write - about what you know well? This place, for example, You like no other feel these areas. You were born in Little Russia. This is your home. So write about it. Forgive me for such a late visit. I have to go, Wait a minute! Maybe you shouldn't so late walk through the forest? I'm calling a coach. No. You... Do not worry, I will get there. Take care of yourself. You are a good person. Paraska! Paraska! Paraska! Yakov Petrovich! Yakov Petrovich! Paraska? The devil is there. Silence! Hush! Let’s go, - Did you see in these woods... - Seen what? Paraska! Paraska, where are you? And I'm looking for you all over the village. Paraska, what are you doing here with the Muscovite in the forest? Gritsko, it's not what you think, I will explain everything. I want you to know... Well, when you can explain, then okay. - You see... - Yes, I see, I see. Stop! You have nothing to bet! - Mr. Pushkin, my dear... - Calm down, gentlemen, I will now loan five hundred rubles from Pyotr Arkadevich, and I’ll get it back right away. Alexander Sergeevich, better borrow from me right away. You don't care if I lose then. And who is it there? Oksana? But you... died. What's going on here?! How is all this possible? Don't you know? You have a bad dream. You want to wake up, but instead you end up in another, even more terrible dream. The world in which you live is not the only one. There's another world - Dark. Hidden. Where evil does what it wants. You can cross the threshold in that world. Because you are strangely linked to the dark force. This is your gift. If you don’t learn to control your gift, you will never find the rider. You... Will you help me? I can only guide you. The rest is up to you. However, there is a person who bothers you. Who? Lisa. - What does she have to do with it? - She takes your heart, and draws you to the wrong place. Tell me... recently at night I, you and Lisa... What was it? Which of you actually came to me? Who cares? You were pleased. Tell me, which was better? I or she? Was it you? How dare you pretend to be her? And don't get any closer to her, understood? Clear? Wake up, You have slept all day, You live life to the fullest, Nikolai Vasilievich. Like a master. Who painted you like that? Do you not remember? I don't remember. Yakim, bring me some kvass, I am thirsty. - And my head hurts ... - From the blow, or what? - No, it's the alcohol, kvass won't help, I have prepared something else for you. Oh yeah. The blacksmith came yesterday. He brought some drawings. He says you ask him to draw dead girls. Thank you. Take some brine with it, it will help, Yakim, are you trying to kill me? Why do you give this nasty thing to me? I can't even thinking about alcohol... But the headache is gone, right? Do not get mad. But don't drink anymore, or the result will be the same. - I sprayed the drawings, - Oh, that's okay. We let them dry. What is this? Oh, I forgot to tell you, master. This is the chest of Yakov Petrovich. As if we packed his things to send them to St. Petersburg, We found a note on it attached. Here. In case of unforeseen circumstances, please give this trunk to Mr. Gogol. Only there is no key. No way to open it. Paraska! You will not be happy ... - Go home, I tell you! - Let go of me! Leopold Leopoldovich! Oh, Mr. Investigator! Welcome. I'm sitting here alone, And there’s no one to talk to. Leopold Leopoldovich, tell me. You are a doctor. You now about chemistry. Of course. After all, medicine and chemistry - these are sister disciplines. Look at this candle. There is something strange about it, Tell me, what else is contained in it, except wax? Laudanum... Belladonna. Absinthe and something else, Where did you get such a candle? At the crime scene. Paraska, Cherevik's daughter, bought it from the Gypsies, The Gypsies? They, you know, they are great masters in chemistry. Popovich assured her burned with a green flame. Green? So, it contains copper oxides. What else did your Popovich see? In the house there came a pig's head in, and his eyes were sparkling and... Alexander Sergeyevich? You are absolutely right. And you are Mr. Gogol, correct? Yes. How do you feel, young man? Good. I'm fine. OK. Allow me then to ask you one thing- What are you currently working on? I... work... as a secretary for the secret police. I write a report about... a pig's head... and a red... jacket. Are you serious? You seriously hope that it will sell well? Lord! Nikolai Vasilievich. What happened to you? You scared me so much! Forgive me fool for lighting this horrible candle under your nose. I was expecting some hallucination, but you fall like death here. Lord... Tell me, what did you see? A nightmare. Everything was so... Real. Lord! Who knows what nasty thigs they have mixed in this candle! Wait, you are saying... That when the wax is burned out and has reached the substance, the candle released smoke, and when people inhale the smoke, they hallucinate? Well yes, Nikolay Vasilyevich, there is a saying “Fear has big eyes." So someone gave this candle to Khavronya. When Popovich came to her she lit the candle and they started to hallucinate. Then the killer came to them into the haus with a mask of a pig... She died of fear, before the killer stabbed her. Nikolai Vasilievich, what do you think - who could it be? Maybe the one who brought this candle to the house of Khavronya. Or... She... Why did you protect her? I'm talking about your daughter Paraska. I know she killed Khavronya. What are you talking about? No, Gritsko! That night when Gritsko fell asleep drunk in the pub. You went to your home Because you knew that your wife was there with Popovich. You wanted to catch them yourself. but when you approached the house, you did not expect to see this. I understand that you really love your daughter Therefore, you protect her. But she committed the murder, and she must pay the price, not you. Why did you take all the blame? Paraska... Is it true? Everything is my fault, My child suffered, because of this wicked reptile. It was necessary to bring her to a grave for a long time. I understood it too late, Forgive me, my daughter. Sorry to have left this reptile live under our roof. I should have killed this viper a long time ago. Flee, little ones! Run away! Stop it! Nikolai Vasilievich, come on ... Are you alive? Where is Paraska? If we reach the river... Damn root! They couldn't go far away. Tesak! Yes. It seems to me that they have left the river. And if so, then we can catch them. At the bend. Can you take us there? Yes, I know the way. Let's go. It's time to warm up, Don't look at me like that. The blood in my veins freezes. You must understand that if I hadn't killed this witch, we couldn't have gotten married, Ali, don't forget how she forbade my father to bless us? You are my beloved, we will run away loin from here, I believe happiness awaits us there. We will pray for our sins, in a new place. You won’t pray for anything, Murderer Where is your bride? You thought to kill me would make you happy, dirty sow? You will not be happy! You will go after follow me in the fires of hell!! And here is your new husband! Take her, she is yours! She's yours! No! Wait! It's very close. The living will go no further, I have all the symptoms, delirium, tremens, hallucinations... Where am I? Why is it so dark? No, don't come near me! to be darkness! Well done, master.... But what are you that scared this witch? I don’t understand myself. There are no witches. You just have to warm up. Gentlemen... God is my witness, that you are the only people in Dikanka, to which I can trust. And I ask you to help me to find the rider. I believe that together we can stop him. Listen. Charitable deed. I'm with you. But, unlike those here, i believe neither in God nor in the Devil. But I must tell you. Your appearance completely relieved me of boredom. Gentlemen, you can have me. What is it, master? We will never get out of this hole. Yakim! Stop grumbling. This is the chest of Yakov Petrovich Guro. I'm sure we will find inside a lot of useful things for our investigation. Vakula, can you open it? The one who makes locks can open them, You are welcome. Lisa! Lisa? Meister! Nikolai Vasilievich Dear, why are you scaring us? Lisa... is in danger. the End
