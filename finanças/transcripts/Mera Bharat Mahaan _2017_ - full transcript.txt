Yuck... yuck... what's this mosquito menace? Today is Independence day, right? Would we get freed from jail? Mad man! This is small jail! If you go out from here, you'll get imprisoned in bigger jail of country. That's the difference! Is country bigger jail? Yes. Those who question govt. Action or criticize it, cartoonists lampooning them, unemployed when demand jobs, all are prisoners! That's why they're in a bigger jail known as country. We're in this small jail! That's all! Why are you growing mosquitoes instead of trees and plants? Why so many mosquitoes? Yuck! Mosquito entered my mouth. It may enter other places also, first finish hoisting the flag. Let's go out. Commissioner, hoist the flag. You must hoist the flag not lift anything. I know the difference, man. We love our tricolor flag that won over the world... Let our flag always fly high! Fantastic quotation, sir! I'll take it down. I didn't tell it, it was some Shyamlal or Gupta. I know you're not that smart. Mosquito... mosquito... Mosquito? Okay. Sir, flag hoisting. What happened, sir? What, man? Mosquito! How dare it sucks your blood in my presence! Victory to India! Prisoner must be like prisoner, why did you hoist the flag? As a Minister you left the flag mid-way fearing a mosquito. Where's protection for the flag, sir? We prisoners only, right? After India got freedom, only mosquitoes and politicians grew in numbers. A mosquito that lives just a week sucks blood to leave us in disease. We're using so many chemicals to eradicate them. What chemicals are we using to eradicate politicians sucking our blood for 70 years? We're spending lakhs of crores to feed them, sir! That's why my India is great! Salute! Looks like he's mad, let's go. Let's live shamelessly like dogs and foxes... Let's live unabashedly like pigs in drains... Let's live shamelessly like dogs and foxes... Let's live unabashedly like pigs in drains... Dying like an ant... Live as brain dead... Losing sensitivity in blood... Let's live shamelessly like dogs and foxes... Let's live unabashedly like pigs in drains... My India is great! My India is great! Watched injustice like a mute spectator... Helping corrupt to grow... Even when fellow humans are murdered ruthlessly... Ignoring it... without feeling pain like an ant bite also... Like flies on dirt and paralytic patients... Let's live shamelessly... let's live unabashedly... My India is great! My India is great! Selling votes for paltry Rs.500... Keeping silent for a quarter bottle of liquor... Without questioning or saying a word on dark deeds of government... Like worms in slush and earthworms in soil... Let's live shamelessly... let's live unabashedly... Daytime roaming... nights love making... We're all machines to give birth and raise children... Utterly useless and ineffective hymns... We'll deliver boring speeches... We get confused without understanding a word of it... My India is great! My India is great! Leave me, sir! Police have got used to taking bribes... It wasn't my mistake, sir. Hey, who are you? If I'm in cell, will you join me here also? I didn't come, they brought me here. It wasn't my mistake but... This is too much! We share a room, you want to share cell also? Stop it! Why are you guys here? Clean India... that's a story! Hail Lord Govinda! 25 dead in a boat accident! 70 dead in a bus and rail accident! Have they reached you directly, Lord? No need of messengers of death in Hell. 100's of crores scams by politicians! Cabinet Minister involved in telecom scam of lakhs of crores. Chief Minister swindles thousands of crores in fodder scam. Except food, they're eating everything, Lord! Politicians! Laws have loopholes! Govt. Lands are occupied! Didn't I tell you, lord? They're usurping lands also. They'll occupy sky also. What's this nuisance everyday? Reading newspaper everyday to God. Why not read it elsewhere? Shouldn't God know what's happening in our country? If you chant hymns in his praise and side track him from issues. Lord, real matter comes now. Drug supply to school and college students! Govt. Says can't stop it. Minor boys and girls are supplied liquor in pubs. Leave me, please. Shouldn't I tell truth to God also? Clean India. Police! Idea! Got money for today's cigarette expenses. What are you doing? Are you mad? If we upload this in YouTube, we'll get lot of money. Let's share it 50-50. Stop... stop... Walk on our dead bodies to confiscate our lands. To forcibly open their eyes, there's only one way to do it. If you want to live, learn to die! If you want to live, learn to die! No, please... come down! Sir, you got bail, please come out, sir. - Is it? - Please come, sir. Hey stop! Sir, you got bail. SI is calling you. No AC, no fridge, no separate chef, are you making fun of us? We'll complain to Human Rights Organization. Are you Sasikala who swindled crores to get these comforts? Hey, if you talk too much. I'll go on a state wide walk for 3 months and become CM. Don't you dare taken on me? - You too got bail. - Bail for us? We're not worth 50 paise when a rupee is in pocket. Who would give us bail? Honey Preet Singh, follower of my Twitter. She would've give us bail. Really great! Buddy, come out, we too got bail. We must thank Honey Preet Singh. Did Honey Preet Singh really gave us bail?- True. Sign here. Buddy, you're really great! Honey Preet Singh bailed you out instead of Dera Baba. You're really great. Won't Dera Baba feel bad, right? Why would he feel bad? I'm his future son-in-law, right? You're super! Honey Preet Singh for you damn faces. Lawyer gave you bail. Greetings, sir. Thanks for getting us out on bail. I didn't get you bail, you were bailed out by him. Who is he, sir? We'll at least thank him personally. If you want to meet him, go to Yummy House, meet a man known as Indra. Buddy, I suspect the man who bailed us out. Okay, let's see. Come. Who is Indra? Wait outside for 5 minutes, we'll come out. A real revolutionary is lead by true love, I know you're here to kill me. Fire at me, bloody coward! You can kill only a man! When one has courage to fight till end, he can achieve victory against all odds. When injustice rules the law, fighting it is your responsibility. Whenever I may face death, I'll welcome it. But another man must hear my war cry. He must take the weapon from my hand. The day we stop fearing, our real life begins! Staying silent means, to continue our journey in another way. Better to die standing up than live under someone's boots. You're not a frog in well, you're cauldron of fire. You're not living dead. You're burning fire. You're not a blind man. You're a man with fiery eyes. You're not a cry of useless man. You're end card to political corruption. My India is great! Today is a day to celebrate. Reason for that is... we've added another victory today. Down with Management Playing with Students' life. Govt. Must give our certificates! They must give us! Govt. Must give our certificates! They must give us! Govt. Must release re-imbursement fee! Release immediately! Govt. Must release re-imbursement fee! Release immediately! Please listen to me! You've been agitating here since morning without food and water. Not a single elected leader cares about you. Because they become deaf on getting elected. They can't hear people's woes. Then, they go blind. They can't see people's difficulties. To forcibly open their eyes in this democracy. There's only one way to do it. Hello, all of you look at me! To make govt. Respond to our problems in our country. First we must die. That's why I've decided to jump from here. Govt. Must release re-imbursement fee and give certificates in 30 minutes. If not I'll jump from here at 31 minutes. My times starts now. This is connected to Education dept. What can we do? CM says no funds. What can I do? Please do something and stop her from jumping down. 13... Our people are on the job. We're helpless. It has become nuisance. Everyone climbs on rooftop to threaten govt. TV channels run it live and earn bucks. Go personally to stop her. 4... No, please... stop. Stop, please... No, please... Look, I'm Education Minister here, if you give me 2 days time, I'll talk to CM, I'll get all your fee reimbursed. No more dramas, do it right now. 2... Education Minister has given personal assurance, right? If you join the gang that comes to loot every 5 years, you too would become Indian Political Service. - 1... - Listen to me, please. If you want to live, learn to die! No... no... come down, please. If you want to live, learn to die! No, please come down, let's discuss it. If you want to live, learn to die! Students agitating for fee re-imbursement. College management, Govt. Or rulers nobody cares about them! Agitation took another turn. A girl Sanjitha in support of their demand, suddenly climbed on the rooftop of the college building, and tried to sacrifice life by jumping down. But police save her life on time with a net. Right now discussion going on in Assembly about fee re-imbursement. The problem has reached people. Opposition walked out of the Assembly demanding immediate fee re-imbursement. This has made public to think. Would govt. Come out of the slumber? Would it solve problems faced by students? Or else this too is futile attempt? Do you know who is responsible for this victory? Miss Sanjitha. Buddy, your girl. In police station! Right from olden times to present time, man has used woman as dirty picture, that tradition has become motto of Corporates. One of MBM's aim is to change that. There's only one solution to all problems faced by our country. Youth involvement. What's the aim of MBM, sir? Socialism! Even today 26 crore people are living with just 96 rupees. 48% farmers are committing suicide burdened with loans. Till now we've seen thieves. Now we're seeing different thieves stealing us in the name of Corporates. Robbing us in the name of education, fooling us in the name of ranks, only rich get medical treatment, poor have to die miserably, they forgot Gandhi, opened Brandy shops all over, they took away fertile lands to build capital, Freedom fighter Bhagat Singh is MBM's inspiration. When British killed Lala Lajpat Rai. He bombed Central Assembly to light freedom fire in country, Bhagat Singh is a warrior! But his intention wasn't to kill anyone. His only aim was to inspire people. That is our MBM's aim. MBM's aim is to stop Corporate looting in Bhagat Singh's way. Don't worry about losing life in this fight for justice. Let's give new lease of life to future generations. Stand by them! Give them power to stand on their own legs. You mean this is another type of Naxalism? If you consider what Bhagat Singh did was Naxalism, yes, this is also Naxalism. But this is not Naxalism with guns. Not death squads with bombs. Let's save Goddess Saraswathi trapped in the iron hands of Corporates. Education is not personal wealth. It's birth right of every citizen! This change must not come later, it must come right now this moment. Like silent revolution, like flowing lava of volcano, agitation must rock, if Govt. Opposes it, let's bring down this govt. Let's burn it down with the fire of our unity! What are the issues youth must take interest? Farmer suicides! Corporate College fees! Unemployment killing families! Everything must change, not sometime later. Now... right this moment. Do you've any sense? Hey you! Come, let's settle it personally. Stop there! If you come without my permission, I'll kill you. Shut up! You gave us such a big house. You gave sofa, fridge, stove to cook also, but we bought tea from outside, at least you should've supplied cigarette packets. Cigarette packet? Don't you've common sense to supply minimum necessities? You gave us everything, how could you forget cigarettes? Okay, you forgot. Can't you send foreign brand liquor from America? Don't think we're insensitive. Indian blood, bye. Should power have to go now? He can't do anything but has big dreams! That's your attitude. No crops and neck deep in debts. Forgetting that he wants to send daughter to city for studies. There must be a limit for wishes. Why are you lamenting? Our lives are like this with such thoughts. My sister is ready to support her education. Why are you creating trouble? Getting late, uncle. Come quickly. Rajanna is here. Taxi is here. Come... come.. Come, my dear. Let's go to city. Mother... mother... We've just one daughter. If you separate her from me in the name of education. What else can I do other than live in tears? Your mother will say like that only, I'm taking you to city for your good. Study well. Take sir's blessing. Okay, father. Greetings, Master. Come in, please sit down, Narayana. Greetings, Master. Seems going to city for education. Yes, sir. If you also go away to city, I've to teach walls and benches. Study well and find good job! Okay, master. This is for you. My father is sending me to city to study. - Buddy! - What? Super sexy girl! Joining our college. The girl so beautiful that I'm like Mahesh Babu, right? If I look at her, she'll definitely fall for me. If you cross the girl's path, there won't be floor under your feet. Who do you think she is? - Who is she? - My Sanjitha. Our Sanjitha? Shut up! Not our, my Sanjitha. It's love, his name is written in her heart. Don't go overboard, she went to city as little girl for studies. Why do you think she joined our college? - Why? - For me! Look at the girl with pink cheeks... She has hidden two freezers in it... Her style is fantastic... excellent... Just her touch is enough, I'm ready to die... How do you carry so much beauty? Careful... careful... Don't worry, we'll carry it... Careful... careful... Looking at you my heart is racing... Hey girl! When you catwalk in miniskirt... Boys in college would get flu... When you walk sexily with perfect figure... Youth would die in despair... Front is hot and cold... Back is hot... You're my only choice, you come into dream at night... Eyes are like flowers... You made my heart to skip a beat... Your beauty is Mallepalli Mirchi mall... Your cheek is spicy snack... Your hip is spinning top... If you arrange a meeting, your words are crackers... Keep your shyness aside... Talk to us, that's enough... If you smile at us, won't young men break rules to reach you? Though your measurements changed, look, how I recognized you. But yours hasn't changed a bit. What? Your brain. Yes, you know Karthik, right? Is he studying or working as coolie? Why would he do it? He's a teacher's son. He's college topper. I'm topper in sports and gymnastics. He's number two. That's okay, didn't he come to college today? He came, he left. I'll ask him to call you, give me your number. Bloody rascal! I broke my back. I told you not to go overboard. But still you asked her phone number. I didn't ask for phone number, I asked her Aadhar card number. Narayana, come out! Greetings, sir. What's it? Where's my money? You've seen it, right sir? I lost cotton crop. I went to bank but they insist on repaying old loan. I don't want to hear all this nonsense. You took loan from me for farm but sent your daughter to city for education. Am I paying for her? My sister is paying her fees. When will you repay my loan? I'm trying to settle your loan. If govt. Buys stock with better rates, I'll repay at least part of your loan. I'm giving you 10 days time. Register your farm in my name. If not send your daughter to work as maid in my home. Come on, boys. He's eyeing our daughter. Don't know what trouble he would bring upon us. Who is it? Who else could it be? My daughter! You and your father are perfect! Father! Are you fine, dear? Why are you both appear worried? What would worry our lives, dear? We spend all our lives repaying loans and interest. That call money Kanaka Rao... Stop it, hubby. She comes home rarely, why are you troubling her? If not with my daughter, who else would I share my worry? May be she has to repay all our loans. I'll repay your loans. You don't worry, mother. What? Are you leaving for city? What's left for me here? Call money Kanaka Rao took away my house and farm. Govt. Is giving double bedroom house in city, how can I not go? Okay, be careful in city. Okay. Greetings doctor. Greetings, how are you doing? What do I lack, sir? I'm fully fit like a bull! Stay like that only. Hey Venkanna! Are you hiding from me to avoid repaying loan? Hey Subba Rao, wait, I'm also coming. Catch him, boys. Forget about him, what about your loan repayment? If I stay alive, I'll repay the loan, Kanaka Rao. Very nice! What? 30 years ago, we left this village. I'm thrilled to see village. Excellent. This village is ours... This land is ours... Soil here is ours... Tree here is ours... Village... land... soil... tree... everything is ours... Which place is yours? Which place? Not just this place, villages nearby this place too belongs to us. If you ask, we own both the states. Both that states are yours? Yes. By any chance, you're not thieves, right? Brother, I think our disguise is perfect. They failed to recognize us. Yes. Yes, we're thieves. We're are here to rob. So what? You're here to rob us, moreover openly accept you're thieves. Are we fools to keep quiet? What are you watching fun? Thrash them! - Our police! - Yes, our police. - No more problem. - No problem. Who are you guys? - Didn't recognize us? - Who? Our Home Minister. Our Home Minister and I'm his PA. Greetings. Note down SI's name. Let's give him award on Republic Day. Awarded! He's Home Minister... this fool is his PA. Are you giving me award? I'll dismiss you. You'll dismiss only if I free you, right? I'll put you in jail and thrash you black and blue. Come! Who is the girl? Looks like a city girl. Is she from our village? Girls have different shapes here, uncle. How beautiful you are Lakshmi... You may be a tailor! Upload photos of every woman in this village. You would be in jail now. Bloody! How are you doing, uncle? Hi niece! Looks like city suits you better, grown very well there. Forget about me, it seems you married third time. That's the power of my manhood. Even now women stand in queue for me. Yes, if they marry you, no work at all. They'll not have children! That's why he pesters doctor to prescribe Viagra for him. - Hello Uncle! - What niece? How about you? It seems you married again. Women go for Narasimhulu because he'll not do anything. But I'm not like that. Even at this age, I'll rip them apart, so scared of me. If so, why did your first wife elope with someone else? Eloped? What a punch, niece! He used to fool us saying his wife went to work in Dubai. Hereafter he'll not think of marriage again. Your son is involved in rape and murder case. If you pay Rs.50 lakhs... Rs.50 lakhs? I can't get him out of Nirbhaya case. Rs.50 lakhs is too much, sir. It is too much, I too know it, sir. Home Minister called now to tell don't change section without Rs.50 lakhs. I don't know anything. Did I ever take bribe without your knowledge? You know about Home Minister, right? He's a rascal! Third rate cheat! PA is worse than him. He took Rs.12 lakhs from my uncle. Did you? Are you talking about that PA? If Minister stoops down to any low level for money. That PA would shamelessly pick money fallen on cow dung. If I give them whatever you pay me, what would I get? Nothing. This shows he's robbing everything without giving our share. Yes. Inspector! We know the truth now, your bio-data is out! The moment we come out, you'll pay dearly for this. Remember! Who are they talking about my bio-data? Petty thieves, sir. You'll lose job and be in our place now. If petty thieves like them know about our deals, we'll be in trouble. For safer side, thrash and free them. I'll take care of them. Hey, don't hit us! Tell me now, is he Home Minister and you're his PA, right? We may be that in city not here, we're nothing here. Then, who the heck are you? My brain is not working for getting thrashed by you. I'm totally confused. Give us Rs.100, we'll each have a bottle of arrack. You want arrack? If I see you again here, I'll shoot you, go away. Look, they thrashed us black and blue! CM planned and getting us thrashed brutally. My right shoulder is broken. If we don't drink now, I think we can't live. Why are you talking so innocently? We don't have money for drinks. Whatever we had, they took away from us. No need to drinks, I'm dying with thirst. No need of drinks, at least few drops of water will do now. Where can we get water here? Move aside! Leave it... leave it... Why are you drinking water I brought for nature's call? Why not drink water from well? Bloody rascal! Greetings, sir. Greetings, who is it? It's me, sir... Sanjitha. Are you fine, sir? What fine? Can't see or hear properly. Sir, I'm here not there. Not here. I can see you very well. Why not consult doctor instead of struggling so much? What's the use of eyes and ears in this village? Farms are under mortgage. Going deaf is better, so that I won't hear the abuses of Call money Kanaka Rao. Is Karthik in home, sir? Why would he be in home? He'll be somewhere in hills or ponds that you played as little children. Okay, I'll go. My body is aching, brother. What's this, brother? Spoke in the wheel of fun, ruined my chance. I beg you, please. Already got thrashed because of you. We came here for drinks, looks like you'll ruin that chance also. - Come, let's go. - Where to? Look there, a man from stone age! Who is he? He's the supervisor here. I'll talk to him, not just few drops, I'll bring two pot full of arrack. You stay here. Will you get me thrashed again? Are you doing fine? I'm fine, tell me, brother. You've good physique with arrack. Why did you grow so much hair? Not just body, even hair will grow if you drink arrack. - Is it? - Yes it will. Then, give me two bottles. I'll drink and see. Take out money first. Not just two, I'll give you 4 bottles. Why worry about money? I'll give you big tip, you can get a haircut also. That's okay, did you see that girl? Which girl? That girl Shakeela. She's still as sexy as she was 10 years ago. She used to maintain me day and night in those days. Was she that close to you? Not close, I maintained her like my wife. Give me bottles, I'll show you my prowess. Drink... show me your power. I'll drink and show you. Show me. How come you're back after years? Where were you till now? What happened to you? I'll tell you everything, that's why I'm here. Let me have a drink, I'll tell you everything. Why do you need a glass in my shop? Empty the full bottle. I'll show you now. It's great, Shakeela. Shakeela, let's have fun. Whatever you say! It's been years since I saw... dance... Sing and dance... Brother, my Shakeela! My brother is also interested, give him also a chance. I gave him long back, he's my husband. Husband?! Greetings, brother. You'll have great fun with her all night, right? No brother... please leave me. I'll leave you. To stop you coming here again, I'll cut your legs. No brother! Escape! When I went to city as little girl to study there, he remembers well about kissing him then and painted it. This is while playing badminton in class seven. Did he see me or imagined to paint this? This is exactly like how I'm now! Where are you? If moons descends on earth and lends me hand... I'll give my life to hold it... Love from childhood days has blossomed today... If shared it is sweeter in moonlight... Is it time to appear alive my paintings right before me... It's sweet nothings in those lovely eyes... Pleasant all the way... Do you know the place where I wrote our names together for the first time? Do you remember the mischievous moments and sharing food? I searched for you at dusk waiting for your arrival... After seeing your paintings I realized your love now... In rhythmic tunes... Why my heart has turned colourful like a rainbow... I'm turning blushing pink when you talk about love... Can't keep quiet... can't stop it... Imaginations are dancing wildly... My heart secretly asks, when are we uniting? With marriage band... Triveni, a student of Karma College commits suicide unable to cope pressure. I joined this college with lot of dreams. My parents were waiting eagerly for completion of my engineering, and finding a job in America, I know that very well. I thought I could spend time in hostel like I spent in my home. But what's happening here? For ranks, they're torturing us like prisoners and orphans. Tormenting us 24 hours! Losing interest in life with every passing day. They don't let us spend time alone, don't let us talk to parents or friends. They're making life hell with loneliness. Situation is so worse that we can't cry or share it with anyone. I can't tolerate it anymore. That's why I'm putting an end to this hell. Mother! Father! Sister! Giving smart phones and internet connections to children. You're ruining their lives. We don't allow students to carry phones in college. They're falling into depression for break up with boy friends. Never did anything till now without informing you. These are the cell phones hostel students are using. Open and see any phone, girls' phones have naked photos of boys. Boys' phones have nude photos of girls. This phenomena is not restricted to my college only. It is found in every college all over the country. But I'm forced to go away from you under unavoidable circumstances. Many are turning into lesbians and homo-sexual. If we try to stop them, they're committing suicide. I've a small wish before I die. Don't send my younger sister to a college like this. Let her study in local college with complete freedom. There won't be a worse man in the world than him. What will be in our room? Torn briefs and worn out soaps. He won't care losing anything but he wants cigarettes. Cigarette smoking will ruin your liver. Here's your cigarette. Triveni, a student of Karma College commits suicide unable to cope pressure, within minutes after Principal announced this,. Principal has been murdered. Principal was attacked and he succumbed to it. Isn't he Jinnah of Coffee shop? Yes. What's the connection between him and MBM? I think they would've killed the principal. I too suspect them. No doubt, they killed him. You killed principal, right? Did we kill him? How are we connected to it? Where's Jinnah? He'll come... come. Come. He says we killed principal. All are saying that. Does Mahan know this? Nothing happens here without the knowledge of Mahan. I must meet Mahan immediately. Come, I'm going there. Come. Go. Death is inevitable, it's not the philosophy. Check what you've done before death. Don't put off candles burning. Learn to light lamps in dark lives. MBM has achieved another great success. Today entire nation is talking about Triveni's suicide... Triveni, a student of Karma College commits suicide unable to cope pressure. They're talking about principal's murder. In this incident principal was attacked and he succumbed to injuries. Inquiry is on to find whether Triveni's relatives or some gang is behind it. That's our grand victory! Does MBM believe killing can solve every problem? Are we living in democracy or kingdom of demons? You said Bhagat Singh is MBM's inspiration. Bhagat Singh bombed Central Assembly only to inspire people. Not to harm anyone, so you said that day. I'm telling the same again. Fire of revolution has been lit... Leaping into sky with thousands of fiery tongues... Marching ahead reducing everything on the way to ashes... So many like you, me and others would become a part of the fire... Revolution will not march ahead without blood stains... Revolution will not achieve it's aim... You're talking about killing a principal, not talking about parents of students who died in the dance of death by colleges. Why go that far? Do you know how your father died? You think it is heart attack but he died because of aspiration. Aspiration? Yes, not only you, many here are ignorant about it. Even scholars are unaware of it. Aspiration means, when we're in unconscious stage, we mustn't swallow spit, food or any liquid, if we do so, it'll be instant death. It happened with your father. Corporate doctor who suggested taking your father to Govt. Hospital, had he told you in detail about aspiration, your father wouldn't have died. You mean? When you took him to Govt. Hospital in a car, if his head was down and other part of the body little higher, he wouldn't have died. You didn't know about this. He swallowed spit. It entered windpipe, and he died. Ours is Corporate education system that doesn't teach us these basic things. Let's live shamelessly like dogs and foxes... Let's live unabashedly like pigs in drains... Dying like an ant... Live as brain dead... Losing sensitivity in blood... Let's live shamelessly like dogs and foxes... Let's live unabashedly like pigs in drains... My India is great! My India is great! In cinema theatres... shops... bazars... cafes... trains... temples... On roads... in buses... everywhere... we're crowding every place... In courts... in clashes... in bars... in parks... in agitations... in flare ups... In feasts... in streets... in hospitals... in burial grounds... It's we everywhere... We don't have any aim... we don't have knowledge... We don't have a goal... Arrogance is our property... ignorance is our world... My India is great! My India is great! We've become corn in the fire of castes... We warm ourselves in the fire of communal clashes... Honour killings are part of our daily routine... Life here is not worth more that a blade of grass... My India is great! My India is great! Politics and devotion... Romance in Ashrams... World fame for philosophy and clash... We're frogs of a well pulling each other down... Cat on the wall to jump any side as situation demands... My India is great! My India is great! In few more minutes, ruling party meet will start in Gymkhana grounds. Execute Mahan's minutely detailed plan! I can no more live as dead or in same rut... I can't act like a living dead... I'll break these shackles... I'll raise my voice... I'll hoist flag of fire to show new path to future... If you've a heart, forgive me... If you're humans, join me... Our country's health is not well, let's treat it... Let's change the fate of this country... My India is great! We're the soldiers of India... My India is great! People are the soldiers of India... Friends, this is the right time to execute Operation Swastik. As Mahan said, before crowd gathers, we must cross the ground and reach backside of the stage, people will not gather there, no one will get hurt. So, we must plant our Swastik there. Karthik, Swastik is bomb, right? My dear brothers and sisters! Unable to stay in the party that has turned against people, Super Duper Star Sampurna Grahan Babu is joining our party. We welcome him! Come on India, march ahead. Bhagat Singh is amidst you as a volunteer. Cover him from all sides. Police are everywhere, so be careful. Brother and sisters! Welcome film star Sampurna Grahan Babu. Sampurna Grahan Babu who joined and left 8 parties is joining our party. Look, our cheap star is here... It's not cheap but broom... Look, our broom star is here... Entering industry with a film 'Broom'... Licking boots of industry captains... With a first film hit... Broom... our broom star... look at our broom star's story... Except first film hit, never again produced another hit... But he's lucky, so never went out of work... Star who sells his dates with one lone hit film... He's entering politics now... Broom... Wherever there's dust ad trash... He's clean it with broom... He'll make our roads smoother than cheeks of heroines... He'll chase of corruption like villains in films... Look, here's broom... he's super... Hail Broom... Welcome Broom... He'll betray at the right time... Hail Broom... Hail Broom... MBM, be careful! Fans are rushing to see film star. Take Bhagat Singh little away from public. Who do you think he is? Chief Minister! All of you welcome him with both hands! To all my fans here, my media friends, to all people here, I thank you all wholeheartedly, I'm very happy to join this party and serve you. You've great expectation from me, but all I can give for the present is... Most holy! Take it. Do you think you're a great man? I'm old city Parameshwar! Every Sunday I play cards with Home Minister on same table. Any settlement issue? I've grown gray hair doing it. Karthik, be careful. Try to abort Operation Swastik. Abort operation Swastik! If not there will be heavy loss of life. I'm telling you, Karthik! What are you thinking? Breaking news on bomb blast! Public meeting arranged for film star Sampurna Grahan Babu joining ruling party. A powerful bomb blew up leaving many dead and injured. Police suspect MBM behind the blasts. People are aware of the agitation lead by MBM against the govt. People are condemning this incident by MBM's Mahan. Who is it? MBM founder, MBM leader Mahan! I blew the bomb. But it isn't my intention to kill people. It was an unavoidable mistake. It happened because of you. Who the hell are you? Why are you creating chaos by planting bombs? What do you want? Many a times we've told you about our demands through media. How can your deaf, mute and blind Govt. Know it? You're neck deep in corrupt and malpractices. Only way out, burying you alive! Execute our demands immediately or else your govt. Must resign. We know how to solve our problems. My India is great! Victory to India! What's this problem? I don't understand. Who is he? What are his demands? Home Secretary, failing to do your duty, I'm suspending you. Please accept my condolences. I'm not yet dead, right? Suspension is like death. All I did was your home work, will you suspend me for that? Even if I did commit a mistake, what the hell Commissioner was doing? Come out, I'll show what hell us! He's Home Minister, if I don't talk like that he'll rip out my skin. What the hell were you doing, Commissioner? I'm not boot licker or corrupt, sir. If there's anyone like that, it's DCP. It's not my mistake, it was ACP's mistake. It was not my mistake, sir. CI was responsible for the meeting. It was not my mistake, sir. SI was in charge of it. It was not my fault but constable Musalaiah's fault, sir. This is gross injustice, sir. I spend entire day running errands in your home, sir. How can I work on duty, sir? To suspend me. Keep quiet. Come home after dusk. We'll revoke suspension. Who is behind MBM? He's a University Professor. His name is Mahan. Already we're in trouble with a professor. Which university professor, sir? No, I'll not tell. Fear! If I tell any name, he becomes viral on social media. Leave it. Where the hell can you find him? No house, sir. Moreover he's a bachelor. Bachelors are big trouble. They'll either become great saints or Prime Minister or Chief Minister. But if you find him, don't arrest or put him in jail. No nuisance, please. Why? According to law... Don't talk about your silly laws. It's useless in our country. You don't know how crazy people of this country are! If we put someone in jail for corruption and murder. That's all! He becomes a hero in public eye! We'll be zero in next election. Wow! What a great quotation! I'll take it down. What are you writing? Collecting quotations by great leaders, sir. For my autobiography. Give me... give me that... - I say give me. - Leave it. I asked doubting you. You'll earn money on this book, I must sit in jail and read your book. Burn it, no ashes too. Like Nayeem case, sir. Hey you... O my God! What do you want me to do with professor, sir? Shoot him! Brand him as terrorist on one channel, naxalite in another channel. All of you know I'm behind this MBM. But nobody knows how I look! But now everyone knows it. Police are making an effort to eliminate me. Mahan shoot at sight order file, sir. Are you finishing Mahan, sir? First shoot him. Does knife know with whose blood it got stained? Does fire know whose body it has reduced to ashes? Can agitation know who were it's victims? Don't expect someone else to bring about the change. You're the change. You're the knife. You're the fire. You're the agitation. Our agitation against corporate and anti-people govt. Mustn't end till it ends. Under unavoidable circumstances, I'm forced to go underground. I want a soldier who can take this forward sacrificing his life. How many soldiers are here? This is the India I had dreamt about! Every member is a warrior. Not a dead body sleeping for 70 years. This generation is not insensitive to be on pyre for 70 years. This generation will march forward for social justice. This generation will raise war cry for equality. I don't mind dying in police firing now. But every agitation needs a leader. So, I'm appointing Karthik as leader of this organization. Why me? Why I selected Karthik? You must know it. Stop! One more step forward, you'll lose your honour. Your Corporates have usurped farmers' lands. We'll not accept making it corporate agriculture. We were born as farmers, we'll die as farmers. You sold your lands to Call Money Kanaka Rao. He sold the lands to Corporates. It's a crime to stop them from taking possession of the lands. Please clear out. If not police will baton charge you. Take possession of our lands walking on our dead bodies. Let them die, we can't spend time and money on them. Come on! Go, thrash and clear them! Karthik is like Bhagat Singh, so I selected him as your leader. You've very important mission now. This govt. Is spreading misinformation branding as terrorists and anti-socials. We must stop spreading of this misinformation. We must make people see whatever we do is for their benefit only. We must make sure they understand our aim. Gone out? Where is he? Where is he? He's sitting here. What are you thinking sitting here at this hour? Mahan has given me this great responsibility. I'm unable to sleep thinking how far can I fulfill it! Street play will start, let's go. We too? This is a story... Story of old times... A story of tears... A story that's not a story... A heart's sorrow... Once upon a time, a happy couple... That happy couple had a lovely daughter... Man and wife had great dreams about educating and raising their daughter... Wife says corporate school... Husband says govt. School... Corporate schools plunder you... plunder you... Students are put under great pressure... great pressure... They put students in race for ranks... race for ranks... What do our govt. Schools lack? Good future in corporate schools... good future... Intensive coaching gets good grades and better ranks... better ranks... Better ranks will get them good jobs... Good jobs with better pay packages... Unable to say not to wife, they got their daughter admitted in corporate school. Girl no more was playing games or singing happily... 24 hours studies and home work only... After school, she joined college... Again the same scene... Marks... ranks... pressure... tension... stress... Unable to bear this stress, that innocent little heart. One fine day... I can't study any further, father... I can't carry this burden anymore, mother... I can't fulfill your aspirations... I can't live anymore, please allow me to go... Forgive me, father... Allow me to die, mother... She took sleeping pills leaving a suicide note... Carrying dying daughter to a hospital... Wife says corporate hospital again... Corporate studies is killing my daughter... I don't trust it anymore... He took her to a govt. Hospital... After going there... what facilities it has... Careless people are working there... Negligence rules roost there... Baby died meanwhile... Corporate college that promised great future, Govt. Hospital promising all facilities to save people' lives, when both joined together to kill their daughter. Unable to bear this, mother too fell down in shock... Her heart stopped... What shall we do now? What shall we do with these corporates? What shall we do with these govts.? Arise... awake... Corporates are behind our crazy wishes... Arise... awake... Corporates have taken over our education and health management... Arise... awake... Taking lives of infants... killing us slowly... Arise... awake... Let's put them on pyre... bury them in a grave... Arise... awake... Taking our blood and sweat as taxes... Arise... awake... Let's question this govt. Courageously... Arise... awake... Hit hard with stick the corporate poisonous snakes... Stamp hard on the serpents of currency notes... Arise... awake... How was the play, buddy? It was hair raising! It's not street play but real incident happened in Mahan's life. Is it? We missed it. Because of this short man. We cut classes in college to watch films. How can I skip a beer party to watch a street play? Short man? I'll break your head. Here's your favourite. - Buddy! - What? Your girl! Why is he reading the book so seriously? What's that book? You're not a common man. Right. - Brother. - Tell me. No time. I'll pack and send it to home. Buddy... a car has come for her. What? What are you thinking? Nothing. You're thinking about something. What is it? Sanjitha, you went to study in city, right? Didn't you ever remember about our village again? Our village? When I got bored of mess food, I remembered about food made by mom. - Then? - Then...? If I had any fight with someone, I remembered mom again. Because my mother used to shout always. Then? If couldn't sleep at night, I used to remember my father. No Sanjitha, remembered about anyone else? When I went out, I remembered about school friends. - What about me? - You? Why should I remember you? By the way, why are you asking this? I remembered about you also. When? Every time I took a breathe. I got worried thinking you forgot about me. Would I forget you so easily? Come... come... Stop... stop... Stop... stop... where is everyone going, Priest? What son? It seems prostitutes have arrived. Come quickly, fool, tomorrow may be late. Stop... stop... you went just now, right? Priest... Why are you always stopping me? You went just now, why are you coming back immediately? It seems for money only, what else can we do? My foot! Priest thought it was free and took his grandson too. Karthik... Karthik... come... Mother! - Come quickly! - Mother! Your father was fine till now. Suddenly he collapsed. Take him to bed. What happened? Uncle... uncle... What's it, Karthik? Father collapsed suddenly, I'm scared. Nothing has happened to me, you don't worry. You sleep silently, I'll take care of you. Karthik, father is serious, I can't help now. You've to take him to city. Don't talk about taking me to city. Already I'm neck deep in debts for his education. Father, you keep quiet. We've health insurance card, why do we need money? Oh God, he won't listen to me. No use of health insurance card, son. They'll ask us to pay, where can we get money from? Father, I beg you, please be silent. If we call ambulance now, don't know when will it reach here? Don't trust ambulance, I've a suggestion, follow it. Kanaka Rao, my father is seriously ill, give me car, I've to take him to city. How do I appear to you? Is my car Govt. Ambulance? I'll not give. I'm not here for your permission. For car keys. Take care of father. Look, his condition is very serious. Fluctuating BP. If you delay he may have a paralytic stroke. Take him immediately to city corporate hospital. There's a chance of survival. Madam, my father is serious, please call doctor immediately. Check him immediately. You've come to our hospital, right? We'll take care of him. Looks like paralysis stroke. I think he needs a ventilator. Do you've insurance? No, we've govt. Health insurance card. This case is not covered by it. Deposit Rs.1 lakh, we'll admit him immediately. Rs.1 lakh? We don't have that much money. How can you say no money? This is corporate hospital. Not a govt. Hospital. You know that? You mean only rich will get medical treatment. Do poor have to die miserably? Wait... doctor, please treat him. We'll pay tomorrow, sir. Patient is unconscious, they say no money, sir. Look, actually no room is vacant here. Patient condition is not good, moreover unconscious. Any further delay is dangerous to him. Take him to govt. Hospital immediately. Please sir, he may not survive the journey. Please treat him, we'll pay tomorrow morning. Problem is not about money, no bed is available here. You must understand our predicament too. Boys, arrange an ambulance. Father... father... nothing will happen to you... Please check my father, doctor, he's serious. Okay, I'm checking. Your brought a dead man and asking me to save his life. Father! Father! Father! He was a gentleman, so I lent him Rs.50000 without any document. Lost that fully. You gave him Rs.50000, why lament so much for it? Would his son default the payment? His son would find a job in city and repay our loan. Already I'm dying to climb 5 floors. He's sitting on water tank. You've long legs. What about my situation then? We were searching for you all over the building, what are you doing here? What? Do you want to drink? What happened? I've been watching you, you didn't sleep last night also. Is it for meeting your childhood love? Love? My foot! Keep quiet. What happened, Karthik? The girl who grew with me from childhood days. I was grieving my father's death. She didn't care to ask, where am I? What am I doing? After years suddenly she appeared before me in police station. Recently she went away in someone's car as we looked on. She went away in car without talking to me. I suspect she's a call girl. Shut up, you idiot. She doesn't look like that. Why is he talking like this? Karthik, come... get up. Get up, buddy. Come. I welcome parents of students on behalf of Kailasam Group. If you wish to make your wards number one engineers and doctors. Without wasting a second, get them admitted in Kailasam. First thing we do in Kailasam is... We let your wards sleep for 4 hours only. We'll take lesson to them for 20 hours. Turn towards me! It's foolishness of Kailasam to think, students will become genius if they sleep for 4 hours. Regarding this, we imported bedbugs from China and did extensive research. We try our best to make our students as stubborn as bedbugs. For your sake, we travelled extensively countries with aborigines. We selected few traditions they follow, and introduced them in our college. What that tradition is... to keep awake students all night, we'll hang them upside down from ceiling. In recent exams, what fantastic results we achieved, 23 students got universal ranks, 60 students committed suicide, this is our college's wonderful record. Recently we did an experiment and achieved great success. That is... education with medicine. A new technology. Till students be heart the lesson, we prick them with needles for 18 hours. That is acupuncture education. In order to avoid painful pricks, they learn lessons fast and recite it. After introduction of this new system, 79% students committed suicide. When compared to last year, we've improved by 14%. This is Guinness record! To admit their wards in our college, parents are selling farms and property. We decided to help such parents immediately. We've arranged a registrar's office in campus for your facility. We've offices of private hospitals in our campus. Parents can sell their kidneys if they don't have money. With money collected from it, they can pay college fees. And educate your children happily. Before you decide in which college your children would join. Please listen to me. They claim students joining corporate colleges will become doctors and engineers. How could Saritha, who studied in local village school become Police Office! How could students show studied in govt. And village schools, have gone to America and become CEO's of American companies. In which corporate college did Abdul Kalam study to become country's president? If corporate colleges are so good, in just 2 months, why did 25 students of a famous college committed suicide? These corporate colleges are sending out 1.5 lakh engineers every year. Where are the jobs for them? Half of them are become thieves and cyber criminals, why state govt. Are looking other way? Neither you nor corporate colleges have answer to this. Forgetting what natural education is, do you want to see you wards as robots and living dead? Save your children! Save your families! Demand govt. To start a good school in every village. Demand to start a hospital in every village. Bring down the govt. That fails to start a big hospital every 50 kilometers. My India is great! Is this education? If you search, can you find dedication? Parents are ignorant, so they don't have any option... O Lord, what's this fate! Students are confused! Students undergo suppression in residential schools for ranks... Unable to achieve the target, students end up in depression... If they can't study well, they decide to kill themselves... This generation prefers death to life... It's competition... Not among students but among educational institutions... Violent studies... destructive studies... Study that robs lives... study that seeks sacrifice of life... Study that can't get us livelihood... study that can't impart knowledge... Study that killed family profession... Study that should've enlightened us... Has it become funeral pyre to cremate? Do our children need such education? A world of that is between hell and heaven... A hell on earth that teaches to cheat... Is it heaven or hell? Education is our right... Education is new dawn for us... Ask it from govt... if they refuse, bring them down... This is our first step... This is our forward step... For sitting here without your permission. What do you want to talk? I never had to given an explanation. Never needed for it. But you must know the truth. When your father died and were mourning his death. I had to face my problems. Mother! Long live, my child. Don't know why I was thinking about you only. You finished studies, right? Got any job? I'll find, who can I not? Why are you so dull? Where's father? Father... father... Father... What were you doing, father? Why were you doing this, father? Do you want to die and leave us in this hell? Okay, if it is death, then let's die together. I'll take it first and then you. Stop... stop... Father, don't cry. Tell me, what has happened? Father! What can I do, my dear? Crop dried without water. We fell into debts last year itself. I had to take again a loan of Rs.1 lakh. How can I repay him? What's there for us to eat? For that, will you leave us orphans? How can we live without you? It's benefit if a farmer dies. If I die, our loans would get waived. Govt. Will pay Rs.6 lakhs if I die. Your mother too would get pension. If govt. Shows mercy, you may get job also. Everyone in village would help you. What's the use of my life? Nothing. Don't say like that, father. Why do we need all this without you, father? Do you know why I went to city now? I got a good job in campus selections. Rs.50000 salary, father. What a great news you told me, dear! Yes, father. I'll repay all our loans. I lied to him about getting a job. I had no idea how to send them money every month. I started to look for a job very seriously. College management refused to give my degree till Govt. Reimburses the fee. In such a situation, when a girl approaches for job... Now I've understood how her position will be! Little up! Why should I bend? For the qualification you have, Rs.50000 is nothing. Use your other qualifications. I'll arrange to get you Rs.50 lakhs. Other qualifications? It means your sexy figure. I think you know about it. MLA's... MP's... Police... IPS... all have tie-up with my company. You must give them sexual favours. I know how to use them. If you do like that, not just Rs.50 lakhs salary, car... bungalow... Can I arrange another girl for this job? Another girl? Yes. Is she more beautiful than you? Is she sexier than you? She's very beautiful. Very sexy! Who is that girl? Tell me! Your younger sister! I met with similar experiences in most of interviews. In times of duress like this, I met my classmate Ankita. Are you searching for job or to earn? I didn't get you. How can I earn without job? Like me. Why God created us so beautiful? To make use of it, right? That's why... If you also want to be happy. Join me. I'll come... to see my parents happy. I'm ready to sacrifice my happiness, my dreams and my love. I compromised with life. I'm telling you this to get closer to you or make you accept me. I've killed my love long back. As a friend, I shared my feelings. It's enough if you understand me. For this life. If you tell you're not in coverage area, do you think I'll stay away from you? You and your mobile company under estimated my coverage area. Come... come... Get into the car. I'll not come with you. I told you, right? To stay away from me. But my phone still has your balance. Shouldn't it get adjusted? Who is he? Your new SIM card? Leave her... leave her... Do one thing, we've online booking too. In that... We've plenty of offers. Take my card. If you've guts, do it. Come. Karthik, this is my problem. Please don't get involved into it. Involve? Where are they? He ran away with the girl, brother. Peter, find and get them to me. Find them. Would any sin defile holy Ganges... Would acts of sin on earth affect sky... They're omnipresent and omnipotent... Uniting in love... My life, love and ambition has been drowned in Ganges.. My sky has come down to earth turning my dreams into tears... Though we're in different paths... travelling to different destinations... Our love wishes to be shared... Our paths changed in the flow... Would your love stand by me like shadow... My heart is for you... My penance is for you... May I seek you... Though we're near... sharing my grief... Love is testing me... Time is playing truant and increasing distance between us... Won't you come back to me, my love... My heart is yours... It's spring time of youth... I withered everyday... If his condition deteriorates, let's shift him to general hospital. I gave you trouble at this late hour. Compared to what you're doing for society, this is nothing. If you hadn't come on time, I wouldn't have survived. Wrong, your way of thinking is wrong. Death will not dare face you till you accomplish our mission. These attacks and wounds can't alter our aim. Time has come to put our plans in action. Do whatever you want to chase away my shame... Hug me tight or smash my waist... Shove it down to hit bottom... Cake is here... knife is here... Cut it as you wish, boss... I'm spelling of glamour... Share it with me... It's thrilling for you... Fire of desire in eyes... my body is shining... I'm epitome of beauty... Hollywood... Bollywood... Tollywood are nothing compared to me... I've beauty... you've money... Climb and explore my mounts and valleys... Full moonlit night... white jasmine is here... Go on full swing all night... Real game is on with Queen of Hearts... One to one meeting with you... Hugs light fire... kisses give kick... Enchant me with your prowess... Have a go... let's rock it... Smash me with your manliness... What? - How much? - I want Sanjitha. Sanjitha? Who is she? The girl who changed to new SIM card and roaming with him. Don't know why... One is better than the other! Select according to your taste. I want only Sanjitha. How many days? Permanently. Rs.2 lakhs for freeing her. He's mad! Okay, do one thing. 10 days... Leave it, between us! 15 days! Why are you? Why are you hitting us? Have you gone mad? We're enjoying here, why are you ruining it? I'm here to tell who am I! I don't have patience to hear your flashback. Get out. If you want I'll pay you more. Leave her. What's this nuisance? Killed me! Hey boys! He's killing me! Who is killing you? It's me... Mahan! What's this? What's this nuisance? Don't you've any proper time for it? Who suggested cabinet meeting at mid-night? Hey man, Ministers' children have been kidnapped. If we don't arrange cabinet meeting now, they threaten to kill them. Did he threaten to kill Minsters' children? Who is he? Is it you, Mahan? Yes sir, shoot at sight order has been issued for him. Shall I shoot him? Will you please keep quiet? Look Mahan, let's talk straight. Is democracy or what to fulfill all your demands at mid-night? Democracy, as night falls, Ministers share crores of booty. You ban Gutkha, then sell it in black market, democracy where a Minister swindles hundreds of crores. It's my habit to do anything on time. I'm giving you 24 hours time. Execute all our demands. Only then, we'll free your children. Don't kill our children, we'll do as you say. Don't worry about CM. CM, if you talk like this and if anything happens to our children, entire cabinet will resign in protest. We'll resign! That's it. What? Threatening me? I'm in this position fighting for the welfare of people. I was elected by people. If at all I fear, I'll fear for people only. Not for people like you. I'm Corporate Chairman Peddiraju here. Tell me. The man standing before you has shoot at sight orders. Kill him in encounter immediately. Tell us if you can't, we'll finish him. It means should I do whatever you tell me! There must be a limit for your interference too. Look Mahan, we're doing whatever we can for the poor. But we get thousands of demands from my MLA's. How many demands can we fulfill? You've come to the right point. If you can't run the govt. Properly, resign and handover the power to another man. Pass recall law to empower people to bring down inefficient govt. No need to talk about laws now. Tell me your demands to free our children. First, revoke Govt. Health Insurance. It was a scheme to help poor people. Its a scheme for votes. We know how corporate hospitals are looting public money. 63% of people are falling into debts for medical treatment. A fourth among them are selling their property for it. There are 25000 different varieties of diseases. Govt. Health Insurance covers only 900 among them. When people get affected by other diseases, unable to foot medical bills, they're committing suicide. Had you spent the money on govt. Hospitals, it would've developed into corporate hospital standards. Anything else? Revoke fees re-imbursement scheme. Ban private universities. Establish international standard schools and colleges with that money. You wouldn't know how many poor children have benefitted by that scheme. There are 20 lakh students in our state. 16 lakhs students unable to find school nearby, unable to bear expensive corporate schools, they're quitting school. Worse than this is usurping lands from farmers, and donating it to corporates. Giving them free houses in city, encouraging farmers to migrate, you're turning people into beggars. Stop this robbing! How can we execute this at mid-night like thieves? All important ordinances in our country were promulgated at mid-night only. Take a look at our history. I'm giving you 24 hours time. If you fail to execute our demands. Ministers' children will not come back alive. Our agitation will turn into revolution. Don't think about making false promise to overcome this problem. People are watching this meeting live on TV. Hereafter people will keep an eye on you 24 hours. If these changes are not effected, you'll lose in next election. Parties will come which will work really for the people. Now, you've only 24 hours of time. I accept all your demands. Ours govts. Are working with the remote of corporates. I've been wishing this for long time to tell my people. People of my state know the truth because of Mahan. I don't mind losing my seat of power. But I'll surely fulfill all your demands. Did they blew a bomb to kill us? No, CM was their target. - CM? - Yes, CM! Any govt. Survives till they're favourable to corporates. You mean handiwork of corporates? CM made a mistake of accepting our demands. I know corporates would face heavy losses because of that. But I didn't expect they would react so violently, so quickly. You mean we lost what we achieved. No, this is world war 3! Ordinary people waging war against corporates. The battle has just begun. End is in the hands of people. This is not the end but starting of another war!
