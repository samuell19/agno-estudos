I just sent the check out today. My father said I have to see it, Mr. Stunder. Well, if I give you another check, that means I will have paid him twice. And that's not right, is it? So why don't you just go home and tell that to your father. I stay until you pay me. You're not getting anything from me, so why don't you just go home. No. You're a thief. You call me a thief? Your father's a thief. He is not! He is so. He is not! You call me a thief? He is so! Come on. Say it, you're scared! Get off my jacket! Get off my jacket! Albert, let him go!

Hail Mary, full of grace... Who built this box? I wanna know who built it? I know I no build it. It's gonna leak on me. Bring me the shoemaker who built this box. By the work, one knows the workman. Rome wasn't built in a day. You remember... there's only two ways to do something. My way and the right way. And they are both the same. Brown! Brown! Hey, Brown! Last-minute motherfucker. What did I do? You don't cut the clock close and work for me. My car broke down, man. Go suck your mother's tit! You're fired! Now, you shot your wad! Fuck you! I resign, motherfucker! Thank you. Suck my dick! Grow one! Suck my fucking dick! Get out of here, you fucking son of a bitch! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucking son of a bitch! The Polack fired Brown. Should have fucking fired Tony Gloves.

Move your end up. What the fuck is this? This? It's a bathtub. Don't be smart with me. Go, take a walk. I want to speak to your brother. Take a walk? Where? Get 202-by-4s, pile them over there. I want these walls in before noon. Okay, boss. That's right. I am the boss. Your stud is too close. I told you this before. They're 16 on center. I want them 24. How many fucking times I'm supposed to tell you the same thing? You do them 24, the wall shakes. I build 24 on center. That's what I build. You want to work here, you build them at 24. All right, those next walls, I'll do them at 24. No, no, no. This wall. Take it apart and do it again. Hey, it's all done. Take it a apart! I'll tell you guys something. I keep your crew working because you guys work on my job. When I tell you to cheat, you better cheat. I find this kind of work again, you're all fired. Well, maybe we should get fired now.

Mac, you think you could do me a little favor? I'm a little short right now. Oh. Forget it. Forget I asked. You sure you can't do any favor? What? What was today? I know, I shouldn't. I mean, what's the use? You save, you save, you work. You save, and then you die. You're dead, so? Hey. Hey. Be-le. Be-la. Ali-baba. What happened to your pants? Listen, Bruno, I talked to the Polack. Polowski? You're on. I'm on? What? Did you have an accident? Paint. I'm on? I got you on. What color's that? No color. Clear. So okay? I mean, you want to, right? You asked me to ask him, so I asked him. Doesn't smell like paint. It's just I have to... Gotta work it out with school. It's like glue. Sticky, yeah. So, what should I tell Polowski? Yes or no? Uh, mostly yes. What? He's thinking about it. Let him think. Well, he specifically told me to ask him. Well, and I'm glad you did. And I want to. And I will, probably. Very probably. Now you got me all confused. He's not like you, man. What? No. Nothing. What do you mean by that? Nothing. What is that? You're driving me crazy now. What the fuck is going on here? Nothing, Mac. All I'm saying is that's what makes him him and you you. Come on, Bruno, spill it. What is that? Tell me? Come on, you can tell me. I'm your brother. I'm not telling you nothing. Look, tell Polowski I'll come in, all right. But not tomorrow. Like, you know, in a day or two. I'll do whatever you wanna do, all right? I know what that is. Shit. Nah. I knew it. I should've went to college. So you got your brother working too? Just part-time. He's in school. Business school? Hey, Nat. No. Where's the 2-by-4? You want to make money, you got to learn to do business. Business. Money business. You don't do with your hands. You do with your mouth. When people pay you money, they don't know what for, and smile when they pay, you done business. Otherwise, all you did was work. What are you looking at? You don't know her. Keep dreaming, Vitelli. You're Alice Stunder? Yeah. Who are you? You don't remember me? Your father's a thief. Open the door. Why should I? Maybe if you look at me you'll remember me. Look at this. Will you look at this. Yes. I look at it every day. This is... This is work. I know. I live here. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... You know, sometimes you get all... You know? That's quite all right. Anyway, I didn't come... The reason why I came... Ahem. Reason why I'm here is, uh... You know... I wanted to ask you if you, uh... wanted to go out with me. If you don't, it's okay. I understand. I'm Mac. I'm Alice. Yeah, it's nice to meet you, Alice. You can keep your coffee. Hey, I'll see you. Okay. I'll see you. And she said, "Don't you feel it?" So I said, "Feel what?" She said, "The feelings." What feelings? Exactly. Yeah, what do you mean feelings? Inside. What kind of feelings? The inside feelings. I don't get it. What? Hi. Hi. How you doing? Hi. How are you? Okay. Hello. Hi. Hello. This is Mac, everybody. How you doing? Hello. Oh, that's nice. Thank you. Oh, how private. Are you a dancer? No. Were you ever a dancer? No. Have you ever danced? Yes. Would you like to go dancing with me? No. I'd like to take you dancing. I'm married and I have a son. Ah. So it's working out for you? Yes, it's working out. Congratulations. Thank you. Well, that's great. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Uh... That's it? That's all you do? That's the whole thing? Come on. You can't feel it? Feel what? The magnetism? I feel. If you were a woman... No, no, you feel what they feel. No, I got feelings. But you can't feel the magnetism. You mean the weight? They feel your weight. They don't feel your magnetism, man. I mean, what are you...? I think you imagine your magnetism. It's like, you know... There's something behind this weight. It's magnetism. Sure, they feel the weight, that's part of it. No. It's the weight. That's part of the magnetism. You're all paraphernalia, that's all. I keep my gloves on. Accessories. You're like a surgeon with those gloves. Gotta be free. You got layers and layers of clothes. What does it do you? You got on a T-shirt. That's all it is. That's all it is. Right under there. Keep laughing, fellas. I gotta find another way then. You're telling me. What I need is a convertible. That's what I need. You want a convertible? Yes. If I have a convertible, I'm made. Anyone who's anyone has one. Marlon, Dean, Elvis, Sinatra, Sal Mineo. And the guy's standing over me. And I'm folding away, folding the laundry with my burnt fingertips. And he's staring at me, breathing his cigar breath on me, almost rubbing up against me. And he's fat too. So I say, uh... "What am I, in your way?" And he gives me this look. And I'm looking right at him. I'm looking right up his nose. And he says, "What's the matter? You don't like working here?" "No, I don't like working here." Yeah, so quit. So I quit. What are you doing now? I'm working, what else? Feel this. Don't mess with me. You know what I think happiness is? To love your job. Not many people know this, but that's why they take vacations. But it's the truth. If you hate your work, you hate your life. I like my work. I do a job for me. Every job is like a... first love. When my father died, when my father was just about to die, he looked away. I don't know where. And he said, "Put the three pieces with the seven pieces over here, "not over there. Put the three pieces with the seven pieces." Back on the job. That's where he went. Sorry. I'm on a path. Polowski, those other guys, they're taking the highway. All they're doing is changing lanes. You feel it now? Huh? Do you feel it, baby? You feel it? Now you feel that magnetism? Yeah! I'm Italian, baby! I'm about to create the Vitelli! Convertible! Convertible! Convertible! You feel it? Well, you fat fuck, you did it! Yeah! Vico! Lunch over there! Lunch!

Punch him out. How many times I tell her. Tuna fish. You know who eats tuna fish? Sharks. Check the mule. Earth special. Nat, this is from my mother. And she sends her regards. My mother's a widow, you know. But she can cook. What happened to that scaffold? What happened to that scaffold? What happened to that scaffold? You know, guys, I don't know. I get the feeling, probably not true, that you guys don't like working for me. Who ratted on me? Fuck you all. You bastards. Hey! What's...? Why can't you do the job the way Polowski says? He's the boss. You work for the guy. Do what he says. Gotta knock down a wall. The wall shakes. It's no good. What do you care? You don't live there. You live here. What do you mean what do I care? Well, you know, now we're out of a job, okay. We got no job. Hey, who busts his balls all day long, huh? Yeah, but I work. I just work. Bullshit. Hey, I argue. Inside. Internal. I don't make a big show. I don't knock down a whole wall! Hey, I'm not breaking my hump to come all over some cocksucker and he don't taste it. But what are we gonna do now? I mean, we gotta get in a better predicament. How did Levitt build Levittown? Lazar? The Milstein brothers? Yeah, but those guys got money. They had money. Money. We ain't got no money. They didn't have money. They made money. Rome wasn't built in a day. Two brothers and a sheep. A she-wolf. Whatever. The two brothers, they saw the seven hills, said, "Let's go. We build here." And from there they took over the world. Yeah, Romulus and Remus. That's the guys. Except Romulus killed Remus. He killed him? How? Don't know. They couldn't decide where to build or some shit. He killed his own brother? It's a myth. Yeah, a myth. So it's true? Yeah, whatever. Look at the map, huh? I mean, they got like this. Mm, mm, mm. Rome. Rome. Rome. Rome! Shit. Without Italy, there is no civilization. Oh, yeah? What about the Greeks? I include the Greeks too. Greek bastards. How come in the movies, the Romans always talk with English accents? In the movies, the Romans, they always have English accents. You know, "My Lord." Why? Will you listen to me? Because I'm talking at you. I'm listening. These guys had nothing. They had each other. And that's what you need. In this life, you work with people that you can look at. What are you saying? That you wanna start our own business? You mean you, me and Bruno? Yeah. Ma will like that. All of us together. She'll like that. We're gonna start a business? Where would we get the money? From me. It's coming from me. From you? I can't picture it. I got it. I'll get it. And we would be full partners? The Vitelli Brothers. The Vitelli Brothers. The Vitelli Brothers. Yeah, who is better than us anyway? Polowski? Polowski can suck my dick. Yeah. He can kiss my ass. Hey! What a take. Cheese. I tell you, if I had money, I'd have a different woman every night. Every night a different woman. Clarence. How are you? Hey, Mac. How are you? How's the accountant? I can't complain. I'm Clarence. Sorry. This is Al. Are you anyone? I'm Vico. Go. Yeah. Whoo! You take a look at that land I told you? Let me know if I can be of any help. What do you build, Vico? What do you build? I build... buildings. Maybe if you're looking for a partner or something? I know... You need anything, you let me know. What I do is I document life. You see, what interests me, what interests me is the primitive. You see. Are you a dancer? No. No. Not here. Would you like to go dancing with me? No. I'd like to take you dancing. Are you nuts?

See what was going on over there with me and her? What, are you out of your mind? Couldn't you see what I was doing with her? Why get involved with me? I was following your advice. Why involved with me when I'm involved with these broads? What, did you see her? I've never seen a beauty like her in my life. Why...? You told me to do that. Why did you come over? I'm gonna fucking strangle you. If you see me talking to her again, you stand clear. Sorry. I was just trying. I had something going. I was manipulating over there, and you come over. She's gone now. I can't believe you. I'm sorry. Sorry. Don't go near her. Go near her. No. I want you... No. Go near her. I want you to go near her. No, I want you to go near her now. No, go. Go ahead, find her.

Exactly, I don't know. But this guy you just met, Clarence, he figures somewhere between 7000 and 10,000. So how much do you have? Half. About half. So you need another five? Uh... about. Why didn't you ask me? I have money? Ask you? Ask you? What's the matter with that? I could help you. You're gonna help me? Yes, it's possible. I'm gonna take your money? Get out of here. I've got $4436.26 in my savings. To the penny? Twenty-six cents, to the penny. It's always good to be exact. I want you to have it. I'm not taking it. Why not? You're crazy. You've been saving up for years, and I'm gonna take your money? Yeah. I'm looking for something to invest in. I'm an investor. Forget it. I'll give you something to invest. I know a good investment when I see one. Oh, yeah? Yeah. So you wanna give it to me, huh? Yes. I wanna give it to you. I don't know what to... No. I didn't mean that. Wait! Wait! No! No! Oh, dear. That still leaves me about 600 short. Sell the truck. But the roof? Hmm. Leave it to me. So, Oona, what's your book about? It's about people who believe in themselves. I mean, if you really believe in yourself... I mean, people who believe in themselves, they're all in lunatic asylums. It's about who you are. What you do is nothing. I am being. And someday, the herd will know what you know: that Oona Goldfarb exists. And then when that day comes, I'm going to buy you out. I mean, everything. Everything. Drawings, paintings, sculptures, paintbrushes, pencils, easels. I mean, you touch it, I buy it. Oh, do it. Do it! Go on! Go on! Yeah? Um, is this the Vitelli house? Yeah. I saw your ad in the paper about the truck. Alice. Just one minute. Alice! This is a good truck. Holds the road. Like a tank. Like a tank. Right, Mac? Mm. Why do you wanna sell it? Yeah, why do you wanna sell it? That's a good question. That is. That's a good question. We're moving to Florida. Yeah, you know. Yeah, we're opening a dry-cleaning... You know, dry cleaning, so you... I mean, you understand, you're a fireman. We just... We don't need it. We thought of driving it down there. We could have sold it there. But we thought this is a New York truck. This has... The New York truck. The courage, the strength to be in New York. And some trucks when you change weather, the engine has to adjust to the climate. Have you ever had that happen? And, well, it does. And this climate, this engine, they're made for each other. So I don't think we should even argue. I think we should just call it 500. Four-fifty. That's fair. Let's... Five hundred. Four seventy-five. I'm calling it 500. Four eighty-five? Let's just call it 500. Thank you. You're very nice. Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice day. Take care.

But I don't sweat. It's always like I stepped from a stream. Anything soft, that's for me. I'm a flower doctor, not a carpenter. I take a flower, I caress it. I've had flowers throb and bend till they jump out of their roots. Oh, how beautiful. I've heard them scream. What? Oh! Get off! Get off! Get off! You're right. I'm sorry. Sorry. Too quick, huh? Too quick? Three. Twelve times three is... Mac, got a minute? Yeah, sure. Go ahead, shoot. Well, I was just... Two times three equals six. One times three equals three. I could use a little... Equals 36. Mac? Go ahead, I'm listening. Oh. Oh, good. Good. I thought you were, uh... No. No. Go ahead. Nine times seven is... Sixty-three. Sixty-three. That's what I said, 63. Hey, math is important. Don't forget that. Fifth grade, I got a hundred on every test. And at the end of the year, I won a penknife. What's up? That's what I'd like to know. Oh, God. One-thirty and he's still not home. He's only got one thing on his mind, that guy. One thing. I'm exhausted. I'm nauseous. I know, too quick, right? I know. Get out. Go. Go. I'm sorry. I mean, it's just... You're so... You're so there. You're so different. You're... You're, uh... So what? What am I? Jewish. You're so Jewish. It's just I've never been with a Jewish woman before. And, I mean, you know, you hear things. I've heard things, that they... That they like... They like to... They like to what? What do they like? Manliness. They like manliness. This hernia is killing me. Vico! Bruno! Time to get up! Argh. Thunder? You guys have a good night's sleep? Yeah. Yeah. I got a few. I got a couple of winks. Good. Good. Let's go, guys. Time to go.

What does that mean? A job? Yeah, what does that mean? Yeah. Well, a job is pretty bad. It's a pretty bad thing. A life? A life is a match on fire. Yeah, a life is a match on fire. It's snuffed out quick, a life. Yeah, it can be snuffed quick. So my life I keep for me, that's what that means. Yeah, my life I keep for me. You don't snuff my life with no job. No way you snuff out my life. Listen, Nat, don't worry about a thing. You're all covered, you're on the payroll, you draw a salary till we finish. After that, uh, you need anything, uh... whatever I can do, I'll do. You're a good man, brother Nick. I thank you. You hang in there, all right? And don't fucking die on me. Done? Get it done. Why you doing it that way? Hey, I'm doing it, so I'm doing what I would do. You do it, then you do what you would do. So that's it. Hey! What are you, fucking nuts? Shit. You're sick. There's only two ways to do something. Only two. The right way and my way. And they're both the same. There's 15 guys in one spot! Spread out! Where's the cement men? Hey, Mac, where's my pipes? Where's that lying user Fat Joey? I need my pipe. Joe, how's your daughter? Fine. Thank you. Bruno? Hey, Bruno! Hey, Mac, I need my pipes. Tony Gloves is asleep in the cellar. I'll kick that zip right in the stomach! I'll kick him. Why do you have to shout? I got... I gotta shout. Shouting is part of life. I got six men over there waiting for pipes. Did you call Fat Joey? Oh, shit, I forgot. How many times I tell you to make that call? Don't know, maybe 400. Fat Joey enjoys to hold up a job. Understand? He enjoys it, man. What do you think he's doing? He's probably off eating seven, eight, nine, 10 hamburgers right now. He's big. He's gotta eat. Man, he's got a neck on him. Have a cigarette. Well, what are you gonna do, huh? Heavy guys, they die young. He's very obese. Like Lard Krugar. Remember him? Sure. Good actor. He was a good actor. Yeah. Died young. Bring it down. Yeah. Bring it down. Good, good. I got a hard-on for Fat Joey. And I'll get him back. I will get him! How you doing? How's it going? Well, so what, do you want me to go make the call now, anyway? That's it. Yeah, make the call. Go get the wood. Go make the call. All right. You know... You know something, I know guys, they do yoga. They could help you. Because you're sick. You really are. I wasn't sleeping! I wasn't sleeping! Get to fucking work! I lost my keys! I was looking for my keys! Don't tell me about bricks, Joey! I'm moving out. Sure, go ahead. Kill your mother. Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me? You're crazy! You'll miss your mama! You're my son! You're my favorite son! Vico. Vico, knock on the door once in a while, and see if your mother she's alive. Okay, Ma. God bless you. Get out of my life! I hate you! Get out of here! Come back! I'm dead! I'm dead! You no-good rat! I'm dead! All right, so, uh, see you tomorrow, huh? Okay. You hit me. I'm about to do it again. Why, you dirty wop. If you wanna fight, take it outside. I'm gonna cut this wop's heart out. Anybody steps in here, I'll give it to them first. One step further, Fatso, and I'm gonna de-brain you. Nobody's gonna do nothing. Anybody does any killing here, I'll do it. This is a private affair. No, it ain't. Put down that stool. Put it down! Drop that knife. Okay, Fatso, if it's killing you want, come on. Get him, Burt! Get him! Get that fatso! Come on. Get him. That's Burt, man. That's Burt Lancaster. You don't fuck with him, man! On the floor. I'd trade a pair of you for a good campfire girl. Hey, Mackey the Knife. You build one beautiful house, Mac. Beautiful. And you know how I hate beauty. It costs. Even in a woman, beauty costs. Let's just go. If he says anything, say you're sick or something. Okay. All right? Yeah. Sick. I feel sick. That's it. You got a fever. Hey, where are we going? Home. We're going home. The day's over, Mac. The horses go and the bosses stay. Loneliness of an existence. Want some drink? I'm building a 10-track house right behind you. You need a hand, someone to show your houses, you're not around, let me know. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I'm right behind you. I'm trying to keep things together. You think that's easy? With what I've got to work with, you think that's easy? All I said was it'd be nice to have one day off. Don't start, all right? Please. Do not start, it's Sunday. Sunday's the day of rest. That's right. And that's what I said. Hey. And it'd be nice to have one off. Shit. Come on. You think they smell it? I'm never ever gonna sell these houses. Don't say that. Don't ever say that. You don't know how to sell. What do you know about selling? Who sold your truck? Right? Am I right? I'm right. All right. So this is where I come in. This is my job. You just... You leave it to me. The smell blows in, you blow it out. Right over here. This is the one I like. Come in. That smell. The motherfucker. Throw your blood, man! Throw it! What's the big deal? No. It's no big deal, Vico. I got four houses here I can't sell because that cow shit smell from the farm is in the walls. I got people coming to look at them. I got fans here to blow the smell the hell out. I got men to hook up the fans. I come in, the fans aren't going, the people smelled that shit, the people take back their deposit. It's no big deal, all right? Look, It wasn't our idea to buy this land in the first place. How's about we don't talk about who's idea it was and we just hook up the fans when I tell you! Hey! Why don't you tell yourself to hook up the fans? This way you can repeat it to yourself a hundred times! And you won't forget because you told yourself! Tell myself? Yes. Because you told yourself. I should tell myself? Tell yourself to hook up the fans, yeah! Everywhere I turn, man, it's like I got nut houses! I got shit houses! Huh? I got that farm, man. I'll go to that farm, and I'll kill every cow on it making my houses smell like dung! I'll choke every one! And that farmer too, man! I'll get them all! And that fat, Gypsy Red... I'll take a hammer and I'll smash it to rubbish, you hear me? I don't give up, you hear me! You'll have to kill me! And it takes a lot to kill me! I don't give! Not until I'm dead and buried! And even then, I'll come back! It's the Polack, but you didn't hear it from me, all right? Psst. What? The informer informed. Francis? It's Polowski. Polowski? Yeah. I happened to have given him the keys to my model house in case I'm not there, I'm out looking for another job, to show my houses. You gave him the keys to your houses? Yeah, I know. I know. You gave him the keys to your houses? Yeah. Now Francis suspects that he's been telling buyers that his houses are my houses. He's using your houses as a model? Right. I can't believe this. You gave him the keys to your houses? Yeah. He's been selling his houses that are barely out of the ground. Mine are up in the air, and I can't sell them. That dirty... Francis knows this? He's got antennas. The fuck. That dirty 4-F. Hey, Mac. How you doing? I heard you were sick. I was. But I'm getting better. Good for you. You look pale, Polowski. I do? I heard you're almost all sold. Luck of the Irish. You're not Irish, Polowski. You know, just, uh... It's an expression. You know, Polowski, the thing about the rat race, right, is... The thing is if you win, right... you're still a rat. Mac! Motherfucker. Mac. Polack motherfucker! Mac! What are you doing? Mac! Leave him alone! Mac, leave him alone! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Mac! Stop the... Don't just stand there. Mac! Mac, you promised! You promised! Mac! Motherfucking Polack! Motherfucker! You cannot tear my pants. You mother... Help them, you cowards! You... Let me go! Just let me go! Get him! Get him! Get him! Motherfucking Polack, you hear me? Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Eat it, you fucker! You fucker. I'll rip your fucking throat out. Motherfucker. That's enough! Try to fuck me? That's enough! I'll rip you're fucking throat. Trying to fuck me? I'll kill you, you motherfucker! I'll fucking kill you! Hello there. Excuse me, sir, but what is that? Huh? That's a thing we do. It's to say a little thanks, you know, to God. For his gift from the forest. Oh? I'll take it down when, you know... Here's a deposit for the man who works on Sunday. We hope that we're the first. You want my house? We want it to be our house. This is a good house. We think so too. You look like good people. Good stock. You'll take care of it? We will. Yeah, okay. Okay. Did I mention, Mr. Tabin, that the cow farm's been sold? Why, no. Yeah, they're gonna build a racetrack. I see. I thought I had to tell you. Of course. Of course. Well? So? Did you tell my wife? No. Quite right. A racetrack for horses, is it? Horses? Yeah, well, sure. I see. Yes. Let me say one word. I'm from horse country. So you still want the house? I do. I most definitely do. Good. They're all sold out. All four are sold. All four houses. I know, Mac, go to sleep. I can't believe it. Some people are born seconds. I don't say they're valets. They're people who dream about how sweet life could be. But when you're born broke like all of us, well, money becomes important. Oh, I know. What you need is loyalty. What you need is people to stand by you and not second-guess you. That's what I'm saying. If I'm wrong for saying so, just say so. Ten houses, prime location. Think about it. Talk to your brothers. We'll talk. * I'm just a gigolo... * Every once in a while things are good. That's how Levittown happened. Experience teaches you when the iron's hot, don't unplug it. You think I should buy this land? These are boom times. The building boom is here. You're the best builder in Queens. I don't know about that. I'm telling you. You buy this land and build on it, a lot more people will say what I just said. * Just a gigolo * As life goes on without me * I'm just a gigolo * * Everywhere I go * People know the part... What's that in your coat? What? The thing in your coat? I get carried away in hardware stores. Vico... Vico, you realize I got a credit line with Mr. Deutscher? Mr. Deutscher trusts me, and you're stealing hammers. What the fuck's the matter with you, huh? What's the big deal? So I stole a hammer from some Jew. Big fucking deal. He's got a million of them. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? Hey. Hey! Cut it out! It's no big thing. Don't you make a big thing about this. He didn't kill nobody. Well, he could have. I was fucking around. You can't tell him what to do. I can never express myself. I can't do one thing. I'm telling him. Don't you tell me what to do, Mac! Ever! Yeah, I'm telling you! You know how you make me look? Huh? Hey! Go get it now! You know, you always do this. You're Hitler. You always do this. That's what you are. Worse than fucking Hitler. Every holiday. You mean to tell me, you side with a Matzo Christ over your own brother? Every holiday. A Matzo Christ. It's the holidays! It's Thanksgiving! Yeah. Yeah, this is our fucking Thanksgiving. Yeah, happy Thanksgiving! One of these days he's gonna get me mad. If I get mad, I'm gonna stick his head in the ground! I'm gonna pull a Samson! Vico! Vico? He's not home, Ma. Where are you? They don't listen to me, Al. I try but... I wanna talk to you. Please, come on up. Vico! Vico! When he gets home, Ma, I'll tell you he's home. Until then, he's not home. I need him. Go ahead, you were saying? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, okay? What? What is it? Something? Something? Something. Something's happening. Vico, please come up. Something's happening? Where's Vico? You okay? He's not home! You okay? Tell him her mother wanna see him. Are you all right? Huh? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. You sure? Yeah. Good. You know how many years I know Mr. Deutscher? What kind of man he is? Huh? This is not right. It's not right. This is wrong that I do business with him, that I should give him my trust. That he wants me so I don't spend the rest of my life with someone looking over my shoulders. Don't tell me, Mac. Please don't tell me. You should tell them. They're the ones who need to know. That's the future. I'm a fugitive on a chain gang. This is no life. All work. Nothing but work. Yeah, for Mac, fine. Yeah. That's all he knows. But I got news for him. Nobody, nothing, nobody, nothing works every day. Every day. I mean, the sun don't even come out every day. I know him all my life. He's my brother. Every morning, "Vico. Vico. Vico." Just once. Call me once. Please. No. "Vico." Ten times. Every one's a blow. I can't take it anymore. All right, so what are we talking about here? Money? Right? Yeah. Money. Our money. Yeah, our money, right. Because you know what he wants to do? Yeah. He wants us to stay with him and build the 10 houses. Look, I... He's my brother. I love him. But, uh, I can't stand working with the guy. I can't stand being with him. I can't stand him. * It was fascination * I know seeing * Seeing you alone With the moonlight * * Above * When I touched your hand * And next moment * I kissed you * Fascination turned * To * Love So you guys have all talked? Yeah, yeah, we talked. It's a big job. Ten houses is a big job. We've come this far, huh? Isn't that something? So it's safe to say that everybody sees the opportunity? Well, uh, yeah. Well, that's what we got to talk about. What? It's just, uh... what I said to you before, you know. No. What? I have some... I have some problems. Well, sure, that's why we're having this meeting, right? No. Look, I want my money. It's your money. You'll get your money. Yeah, we can work something out. I don't think you understand. I need it. I need all of it. All of it? I mean, I've done everything I can. I... I can't do any more. Okay. No, come on, it's okay. Look, if you need money, what we can do is we can... No, Mac. No. No. What? What's the matter? I want my money. All my money. And then that's it, I'm out. What is going on here? Vico? Yeah, I think, uh... I think it is better. Better? We split up. You guys are leaving? What happened? That's our decision, that's all? This is the way you think with a family? Payoff? I don't know you anymore. Yeah, we want our money. Your money. Your money? Yeah. Yeah. You guys think I go through all this... What do you want us to do, Mac? What can I say? It's not supposed to be... It's supposed to be us. Together. I don't know these people. Maybe for once you should open your eyes, huh? Open your eyes. What's going on here? Why don't you just take five? Take what? Maybe you'd better. Take a walk and leave us alone. Vico? You two are the ones should take a walk. Vico? Oh, you think so, huh? Vico? Let me see your face. Are you going with him? Yeah. I am. I'm not working with you, Mac. Stab your own brother. How many times I'd walk home... just to get away from you. Sick to my stomach. What do you want us to do, huh? What do you want us to do? You want us to hold your hand? Want us to live our lives for you? It's over. We're splitting up. That's it. Everything gets split. That's life. And you know what I say? You know what I say? Great. That's what the fuck I say. Great. Great. You get out of here and you leave this man alone. Get out! Let's go, Harr. Okay, Harr. Come on, we're not wanted here. Oh. Shh. I'll get them. I'm gonna get them. So this is how you want it, huh? This is how it's gonna end? Hey, from now on, you call "Mac," I don't turn around. I don't hear no more from you. You know something, Mac, you're a cripple. You know that? I'm a cripple? You motherless motherfucker. What have you ever given to anyone in your whole life? Get out! These are my houses! Get the fuck out! Hey, Mac. Hey! No, I'm clean. You're clean as shit. No, I am clean. These are my houses. Take your dirty, filthy money and get the fuck out of my life! I'm clean! I'm fucking clean! I'm fucking clean. Fucking clean. Do you hear me? I'll kill you! Do you hear me? I'll kill you! Get in the car. Bruno, leave it. Leave it. Bruno, Leave it. Leave it. No, leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Come on. Come on. Leave it. Leave it. Get in. Just get in. What's the matter, Mackey? You need some money? Here, Mac. Take this. I don't need it. It's over, Gus. Take the money. It's all right. It's not the money, Gus. It's not the money. Here. Here, take it. Take this back. Take your quarters back. No, it's all right. I don't need it. Now, listen to me, Gus, you take your pay. No. You take it, please. Now, you listen to me. Listen to me, Gus. Listen to me. You take your pay. You take your pay, understand? No, you keep it. I'm all right. Please, take the money. Please. Take it. No, Mac. I gotta watch over everything. Jesus. I gotta do everything. Everything. Every stinking thing, I gotta do. Everything. Everything. I gotta do everything. See the detail? Yeah. That's care. That's someone taking the time. They actually took time. I built that. We built that, me and my brothers, out of the ground. In your grandfather's day, the man who had a craft, that was the thing to be, not like today. Today it's the man who can talk who's respected. Where before, it was the man who could do, not talk about it, but actually do something. They were the ones looked up to. The beauty of it is in the doing. And doing it. Once you reach the goals, it's nice. It's pleasant, but... It's the doing. That's the thing. John, are you home? This is Daddy. John, are you home? Hello, John? John, are you home? John. Are you home, John? If you're not at home, when you get home give me a ring on a job, please. Put out my number on a job, John. Soon as you get back, call me at home or call me on the job. All right, John? Yeah, man, with these fucking machines, they're driving me crazy. Sometimes he's home, and I talk into the beep and he gets on the phone. My son John, you know?
