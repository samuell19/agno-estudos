[young Jack] "My always dearest girl, I want to write and let you know how much in a very short period of time that I've known you, I love you." [young Ina] "My always dearest love, I have much hope that we will find each other wherever we may land. Kisses, Ina." [young Jack] "I'm writing with a pencil stub. Darling, try to steal a pencil for me somewhere. Much, much love, Jaap." [Jack] I'm a very special Holocaust survivor. I was in the camps with my wife and my girlfriend, and believe me, it was not easy. [Ina] I did this for 3 bar mitzvahs, 4 weddings, 75 birthday, 80th birthday, 85th birthday, 90th birthday, and... 40th anniversary, 50th anniversary, 60th anniversary -- that's today. [indistinct conversation] [Jack] These books should be on the dining table. Okay. [Jack] These are all pictures of us of all the years, you know, in this. Okay? 60 years of marriage. Congratulations. Congratulations. [Jack] Beautiful pictures in here. This is a nice picture, too.

[speaking Dutch] Here we used to live on the second floor. There we had about four or five rooms. My father and mother, with three children, all in cramped quarters, really. We were poor, and we were not poor. My father an unbelievable, interesting, wonderful man. They were able to show us really that one can live without money in wonderful ways. The Friday evenings were very special. The prayers were nice. The singing was nice. But before we started, he always gave us a Bentch, a special prayer, a wonderful blessing, and the fact that even my first wife, who I had my problems with, still remembered after the war many times that, "The most beautiful time of my life was when your father gave me Friday night blessing." [Ina] This is the house I lived in from 1937 till 1943 till we had to leave it. My father was a diamond manufacturer. He had a polishing plant... I would say the second largest in Amsterdam. So he went to the factory every day. He never went on Saturday. We were Orthodox. When he had a car, he had a chauffeur. We always had two maids and then, of course, once a week, a cleaning lady to clean what wasn't dirty. My mother was always busy in the house, and I always asked her, "What do you do all day?" and she says, "Tidying up." A lot of happy memories, and I'm happy when I see the house. But then you think of all the things that happened in the end and then it puts quite a damper on it all. [Ina] May 10, 1940. We heard planes, planes, planes flying over, and we heard shooting, and we just knew we had been invaded. I was young. I was 17. I guess a person of 17 doesn't worry as much and doesn't project as much what is gonna happen. The Dutch army held out for five days. [gunfire] And on the fifth day, they bombed Rotterdam. They just annihilated the whole center of the city. And they said, "If you don't surrender now, we'll do the same tomorrow in Amsterdam." [crowd chanting indistinctly] [Jack] The most important moment at that moment was the leaving of the queen. I remember crying when the queen on the radio gave a special speech that said, "We will take care of you from London, but at this moment, it is most prudent to leave." [woman] I have had criticism of the queen... Queen Wilhelmina, the mother of your country, and people adored the queen. She was something phenomenal. I have no good word to say about that. [Jack] Her leaving was really the beginning of the end. But we didn't know that, how bad it was going to be. [Ina] Things started to happen. You couldn't drive a car anymore. You had to hand in your bicycles. You had to hand in your radios. And then you had to hand in all your valuables. [Jack] We really didn't have the feeling that our lives were in danger. With every measure, you thought you could live with it. We were only allowed to do shopping between 4:00 and 6:00. So, you would go only shopping between 4:00 and 6:00. Teachers, they weren't allowed to teach anymore at the universities and schools, so they were teaching at the Jewish schools. I remember the first year we went still to the seashore. Second year we couldn't go to the seashore anymore. And still we came together and celebrated birthdays. [Ina] June 6, 1943. I was going to a birthday party of a friend of mine. And I walk in there, and I get introduced to this wonderful couple. And I said "Hello," and the only thing that went through my mind was, "They don't belong together at all." [Jack] Manja happened to be a wonderful woman if she was good, and she was an impossible woman. Many times she stopped talking to me for a week. And after a week suddenly, she was the most charming woman you could think of. [Ina] She had beautiful, curly, orangey-blond hair. If you took her parts apart, she wasn't that beautiful. She didn't have a good nose. She didn't have good eyes. But the whole package was just something unusual. [Jack] Manja was really not marriage material. In 1941, I told Manja, I said, "This can't go on. Let's stay together for the war." She says, "No, I agree with you. Let's just divorce after the war." She was sitting on the lap, that's really when I said, "They don't belong together" of the father of the birthday boy, who obviously was flirting back and who liked her. All men liked Manja. [Jack] I will never forget coming in that room and seeing a beautiful girl sitting there, and I said, "My God, I wish I was married to that girl." I will never forget it. And then I started talking to her while Manja was flirting with everybody. I remember I spoke all the time to that wonderful girl, Ina Soep. She was very well-to-do, and I was basically poor. And the difference between rich and poor people was great. But I said, "It's a passing thing. I will never see that girl anymore." [Hitler speaking German] In the beginning, when Hitler started his terrible radio talks, braying out at the Jews and the rest of the world, and he would kill them all, I believed it. I said, "This man is going to do it." And all the other people said, "No, don't take it so seriously." I was the only one in the family who went into hiding because I said, "I can only fight the Germans or survive if I will take on a new identity and not let them know that I'm Jewish or have anything to do with the Jews." In the beginning, it was not that easy to get into the resistance for Jews. They needed Phillip, my husband, because he was an officer and knew much about arms, how to fight the Germans. [Ina] I wanted to go into hiding, and I had a lot of friends, gentile and Jewish, who were in the resistance. They were perfectly willing to help me and place me someplace. We falsified identity cards, which is actually an art. You have to be an artist because it's so complicated. [Ina] We went together to a photographer to have -- Yeah, the beautiful picture. [Ina] Pictures made for false papers. But my father got wind of it, and he said, "You're not going. You can't go. If they come to arrest us, four people, and only three, then we will have carry the consequences, and you can't do that to us. That's not fair. And I'm... I feel that I can protect you." He didn't quite understand, I think, that with the Germans, it was a whole other deal. My father was a member of the Jewish council, which gave, up to a certain point, certain privileges. [Jack] The poor people were sent away first, and then the middle class, and then the rich people. So, the difference between rich and poor had never come out more horrible than in these years. [Jack] Every night, the Germans were raiding homes... [shouting in German] [Jack] ...knocking on doors. They say, "Are there Jews living here?" I remember going to the bathroom 10, 15 times every night, so nervous I was. [Betty] I only went out after 8:00, and one of those evenings, I decided to go to the house where Jack and Manja were living to try to get them to go into hiding. I had my contacts. I could take care of that. But when I called at their door, it was after 8:00. There they were staying, petrified faces in great fear because it could only be the Germans who were calling after 8:00. But I couldn't convince them that the Germans would kill. [Jack] I was still an accountant and I had clients, and I had appointments the next day, Jewish clients who I helped to hide assets from the Germans. So I felt also a tremendous amount of responsibility. A hundred passes to use the streetcars were given, and I was one of the hundred. I really thought I was an important man. I was an important man for a period. I knew you were not. [Betty] My brother said, "We are strong, and we are young. We will have a very hard time, but we will survive," so I was leaving the house like someone who was already losing the best part of the family. [bell tolling] [Jack] My father was an accountant, and we had an office together. The Germans stormed in. They said, "Everybody out." Every Jewish one was turned out And they were taking us all walking to Amsterdam. For a German a Jew was like an animal. When we came to a square, they took out of the 400, 10 people. And I was one of the 10. They put us against the wall. And then 10 Germans game with their guns drawn. And the Jew says a special prayer, the Shema prayer, when his death comes. And I really thought at that moment that my time had come. [gunshot] And they did not kill me. They were shooting in the air. All the Germans, they were laughing their heads off. And they were kicking my back, and I was allowed to leave. That gave me a tremendous amount of willpower to say, "If I can survive this, maybe I have a chance." [Ina] Both our neighbors tried to commit suicide. This was an elderly couple. Put on the gas. And I remember looking out the window. They had brought them outside. They were lying on the grass, and they survived. On this side, number 18, lived a young couple. He and his wife and their 2-year-old daughter committed suicide and succeeded. [Ina] My brother Benno was taken in a reprisal raid. Eventually, they sent him to the notorious camp Mauthausen. The Germans kept on promising m father that they would get him out. And every time they said, "well probably tomorrow he'll be back," and I remember my sister-in-law walking over to the bridge there to see him come. Of course, it never happened. [Jack] After all the measures were taken, the Germans said, "Now we are going to make a major measure." The major measure was the so-called deportation, which more or less said, "We are going to take you to a labor camp. You are taking along all necessities you have. The small things you can take along." And suddenly, everybody was packing. You had to leave your entire home with all the furniture, with your records, with your books, with everything. [Ina] The next day, a Puls moving truck would pull up in front of the house, and they would empty the house, and all the furniture would go to Germany. [bell tolling] [Jack] Westerbork was originally created by the Dutch government. When German Jews came to Holland, they tried to put them with families, but after a period, so many came we did something we should not have done. We created that camp Westerbork before the war. Those German Jews were in charge when we came into Westerbork. They used their might in every way. Basically, they get back to us for the unfair treatment we gave them. I even can't blame them all for that. [typewriter keys clacking] [Ina] We got there in the evening, and we were put in a registration hall. And then in the middle of the night, they told everybody, "You go to this barrack. You go to that barrack." [Jack] I found out where the Soep family is coming in. I said, "I would like to meet that girl." [Ina] So, Jack went to this housing authority and said, "can you see to it that I get into barrack 64?" The three of us were in the same barrack, Jack, his wife, Manja, and me. I could see Manja's bed, and Manja could see my bed. We were both on the third tier. I don't remember exactly our first meeting there, but he must have said something like, "Remember we met at that birthday," and that's how it started. Usually, in the evening, we would go out for a walk on the so-called Boulevard Des Misères. It was pitch dark, so it was very private. We wouldn't be the only ones. There were other couples that were walking there till curfew. There would be a siren, and, you know, you had, like, five minutes to get back. [siren blares] [Jack] Westerbork was unique. There was no camp like Westerbork in Europe. We had a sporting ground. We had some soccer matches there. We had a hospital. Every father and mother had to work, so we had to do something with the children, so we gave them a normal school. And I was lucky. I was a good organizer. That way I got the job of being the principal of a school. This was all part of the make-believe that Westerbork was not bad, and the next camp would be another Westerbork. And I would say 90% of the people in Westerbork believed that. [speaking Dutch] I remember we went through woods to the camp. [Ina] The trees don't look too old at all. [Jack] They don't look as old as I am. [speaking Dutch] Where was the Boulevard des Miseres? That was the sports arena. [Jack] That's where I won my 1,500 meters. [Ina] You won, huh? [Jack] No. -[laughs] -[Ina] Strange. [Jack] Strange. [Ina] Yeah. Oh, yeah, there we were. How is it possible that we really were there? [Ina] He won my heart by sheer persistence, I would say. [Jack] We started to fall in love. I felt that right away. We couldn't see each other too much in the barracks itself. I think we really met always walking. [Ina] We were holding hands or arms around each other, and there was a certain amount of necking and, you know, whenever that was possible. But that's about the extent of the lovey-dovey parts. -[Jack speaks indistinctly] -[Ina] Yeah. -I can do that more. -Yeah, yeah. [Ina] We tried to keep it secret. I didn't want my parents to know. My father never approved of my boyfriends, and I knew he would certainly not approve of this. And I certainly didn't want to do any offensive things toward Manja. [speaking Hebrew] I really liked Manja. She was a very nice woman. I visited Manja once and asked her. 'Why did you marry Jaap anyway? She said, "I will tell you the truth. I really loved your father. And I didn't want to disappoint him. I couldn't leave Jaap in this difficult time. [Jack] The moment it became really serious and people told Manja about it, Manja said, "it mustn't go on. I don't want you to have a relationship." She would forbid Jaap to see me, and that's how the letter writing started. [typewriter keys clacking] [Jack] "Dear sweetheart, just a few words in great haste.. . You are in bed. I'm in my office, and the worst is that Manja is in her bed watching your bed with 'argus' eyes. If there's anything wrong in our relationship, it is that you are afraid that due to my unfortunate marriage with Manja, I was driven into the arms of the very first girl I saw was available. Don't be afraid of this, please, because I want to call you my wife since I feel more of a similarity in character with you in a few weeks than in the seven years that I've known Manja. The first whistle is now blowing. So if I stop now, I will be asleep by the second whistle. Sleep sweetly and well. Much, much love, Jaap." [Ina] I always told him that I had this boyfriend since I was 12 years old that I was crazy about who had been also caught in a raid before the deportation started, in a door to door raid in '42. I had no idea, of course, if he would or not come back, although my hopes and my thoughts were, "Well, if anybody makes it, a young guy will make it." And I always told Jaap, "If he comes back and you come back, and put the two in front of me, I don't know what I'm going to do. I have to choose." And in my mind, I always thought the first thing to do is to choose Rudi. [Jack] She told me many things about him. And she also told me that, "As long as I don't know where he is, if he comes back, he's my first choice," not knowing that he had died already a long time ago, because he died shortly after he was taken to Auschwitz. [Ina] The one thing that I really regret is that when in 1941, best friends of Rudi's parents were leaving Holland to go to America, and they were very fond of Rudi, and they asked his parents could they please take him along. But we were so against it, of course. He didn't want to leave me. I didn't want to leave him. He just fought it and said, "No, can't do it." And, of course, if I'd done it, he would have gone to the states and probably would have survived. I really think about him often. He was actually such a large part of my teenage years. So... It stirs emotions always. Actually the same as my brother. [sniffles] I just... use these two people for everybody else. [Jack] To tell you about the Holocaust is very difficult because I don't understand it. If I don't understand it, how can your wonderful teachers who are teaching the Holocaust make you understand it? We were very lucky. You know why I was lucky? We went to a concentration camp. We did not go to an extermination camp. And when I look at children, I always can cry, 'cause then I remember my children in Westerbork, children like you who we gave a wonderful education, and every week a train left Westerbork, Auschwitz. Auschwitz, Westerbork. And the children did not know. They were sure they were going to another camp, and they all were killed. [dog barks] [Ina] They needed every week 2,000 people to be sent to the east. And they didn't really care who they were as long as they had 2,000 bodies to go. So every Tuesday morning, a train left at 6:00. The main purpose of everybody's life in Westerbork was to stay out of next Tuesday's transport. [Jack] You lived only two days Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, you started to tremble. On Friday, you were told you have to leave on Tuesday. On Saturday, you tried to get out of it. On Sunday, you were told you can't get out of it, and on Monday, you start to pack. Oh, you packed a lot of underwear, a lot of good clothes, a lot of ties. Yes, you would go to a labor camp. [Ina] And on Monday night at midnight, they would come in and read the list in every barrack, people who had to go. [woman] It was usually in the middle of the night. And the minute people's names were called, there was screaming and crying. It was all in alphabetical order, so if your name was skipped, the relief , the relief that people felt because they could stay one week longer. [Jack] I will never forget one Monday night, suddenly my name... Polak, Jacob. [Jack] ..."Polak, Jacob." I said, "oh, my God." And then they gave another date, birthdate. I know the man who had my same name but only had another birthday. [Ina] The German Jews, they ran all this. The camp commander would only come as the train was leaving practically to take a walk, but these people ran it. And some of them, it's an awful thing to say, but some of them behaved as bad as if they were the Nazis, really. [Jack] Many times, they needed me to help people to put them in the cattle cars. The young people, you said, "goodbye," and, "we will see you again," and, "I hope you don't have to work too hard." And you see old people, and I brought people of 70, 80, and 90 to the cattle car. "My God, what are the Germans going to do with people of 90 years and over?" When my parents were on the list, we didn't know what was going to happen to them. The only thing I was afraid of for them was they had to work too hard. They had their best clothes on. I said to my father, "The shoes aren't strong enough. You're going to a labor camp. Why don't you take my shoes?" I brought them to the train, and I put them in the cattle car like I put everybody in the cattle car. And still, I did not have that feeling "this is it. Goodbye." I had no knowledge at all that they were going to be killed. My father and mother were gassed in Sobibor. [hissing] [train whistle blows] [Ina] Remarkably, the cabaret would be always Tuesday nights. ["die Westerbork serenade" plays] It wasn't so easy to get in. You had to have connections. There were some people that said, "I would never go there." Here, we're in this camp, and we want entertainment, and it's all done for the indulgence of the Germans. The commandant just loved it, and I think it kept these people, for a long time, in the camps. Of course, in the end, no more cabaret and no more people. [violins play] [young Jack] "Friday, December 3, 1943. This afternoon, I enjoyed listening to Beethoven's ' Kreutzer Sonata,' played by Dr. Weiss and Pollack. So very beautiful. My thoughts were, as always but especially when I hear music, with you. I want to write and let you know how much, in the very short period of time that I've known you, I love you. I feel when I'm with you, and crazily enough, when I'm not with you, a sense of peace that I've never really known with any other girl. I have the feeling that we completely understand each other even when we don't speak word. Know above all that in my mind, I hold a vision of an ideal marriage in which man and wife share a mutual goal, in which each complements and supports the other. We must often go and hear good music. We must go and see good theater. And in exactly this way, grow closer to each other. Good night, sweet girl of mine. Many, many kisses, Jaap." [Ina] I used my sister, Josette, as the messenger of love. She would hand my letters to Jaap and vice versa. [train rumbles] [Jack speaking Dutch] Here was a school. [Ina speaking Dutch] If you were Jewish kids in 1942, You would have been here, at this school. And he would have been your principle. I was the head of school here, in Westerbork. 63 years ago. What did you teach there? We had a fantastic school. And fantastic teachers, professors. Every week kids and more kids came... and only because they were Jewish. They has the Jewish star. Only Jewish kids were picked up. I can talk about numbers and numbers of the war. But if I think about the one and a half million kids that were killed. It was terrible. -You have to realize how lucky you are. -Yeah. Because you live in a normal world, not completely normal, actually but you can have a lot of fun. You an eat... ...you can do the normal things in life. All the kids that went to school here... ...could never do what you can do. Have you all read 'The Diary of Anne Frank'? 'Anne Frank' is the second most read book in the world. I can tell you all, 'Anne Frank' can be a guideline in your life. How old are you? I'm now 93. [Jack] I feel young again to be able to talk to young children. [speaking Dutch] -Are you Jewish? -Yes. See kids, this gentleman is a real Jew. Can you see a difference between him and me? No? There's no difference between us. This is one thing I always tell kids. Never, never discriminate. There is no difference between a Jew and a non-Jew. There is no difference between a black and a white man. We're all born the same way, and we all die the same way. To get to a better world, all together we have to find peace and make peace. It's very difficult in a world where there's so much war. I've said enough, okay? [young Jack] "My dear, dear Inaka, considering the circumstances, Manja will give us a hard time. And we won't be able to take walks, perhaps having little or no chance for close contact. You must not let this discourage you. We must find strength in the knowledge that there is someone here who makes life worth living. Maybe you can adapt a piece of my philosophy in life... that, in everything, even in the gloomiest things, you must look for the sunny side. And even if you can't find any sunshine, you must look into the future in which, ultimately for both of us, happiness lies." [Ina] What probably kept me going from his letters is his wisdom because of being 10 years older and being much more experienced in life than I was, and his nature, his optimistic, upbeat nature which always tried to lift me up if I was down. Jaap's presence and his feelings for me was a big help to me. [Jack] "The day before the transport is always somewhat nerve-racking. I must admit that this is slowly beginning to get to me, Ina. Mostly because you never know what to expect from one day to the next." "Dear Inaka, it's now 11:00 a.m. And after this unnerving transport with my mother-in-law. She was very strong, and so were Manja and her sister. I must tell you very frankly that it was as bad for me as when other loved ones of mine went. [train whistle blows] Every departure gets us down. But now this transport is over, and as things are, we must go on. You must look at it in the same way I look at our imminent departure... that if 100,000 Jews from the Netherlands have already had to bear this, then why not us? Especially since we're young... if I can include myself with the bald head. I really hope that now you can show me what a strong woman you can be. I think we should slowly ready our belongings as, in any event, we will have to move. Much love, Jaap." [Betty] My husband, caught by the Germans. I remember when they came to take us. I kicked his revolver under a chair. And they found his revolver, of course. And that is already enough to kill someone. I could hear in another room the way he was interrogated. There's a lot of torture and a lot of shouting. The last words Phillip and I have spoken together were just when we were arrested. The wardens took care that we could write, on a very small piece of paper with a terrible pencil, some words as a parting. He wrote, "You always have been my best comrade at my side." And that's what I cherish. [young Jack] "February, 12, 1944. Sweet darling, this morning, we received our notice that we will be transported to another camp, so we immediately started to pack. It's now the evening before my departure, which despite everything, still came fairly unexpectedly. All I want to say is that my departure from here makes me very sad, and it's only for one reason. I hope that you will soon follow me. I cannot tell you how terribly I feel to leave you in this way, but nothing can be done. Dearest Inaka, this is not just a departure letter, only a wish for a very, very speedy coming-together for us. Embraces and love, Jaap." [singing in Hebrew] [Jack] One moment. This, translated in english, "Remember what Amalek did to you when you went out of Egypt." But you can translate that in today's life. Remember what Hitler did to us when we left Holland. What can you tell your children? Many times, Ina's told me, "Don't say too much to them because you'll frighten them." But on the other hand, if Holocaust survivors don't talk to their children, then the children ask themselves, "what is behind their silence?" [speaking Hebrew] You shall be not as the important men in Jewish life, as the important women in Jewish life. [Ina] See, there we go. It's the Star of David. Margrit, did you talk to Sofie about what her grandparents went through? Or not yet? I haven't really discussed the war so much with Sofie, but we're easing her into it. [Ina] Sofie's a very, very sensitive child. I think it maybe give her nightmares or something... Like it did you. Which, only, I didn't know it. She told me that a few years ago. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to figure out escape routes from our house. There were a million hiding places. And I still dream about the Nazis. [Ina] I think Margrit imagined a lot and dreamt about almost, like, me being there. [sighs] Yep. She had kind of put herself in my place to the extent that when she was in college, like all the kids, she had eaten a lot of starches and stuff, and she had gained at least 10 pounds. I said, "You know, Margrit? Eat a little less. Next vacation, when you come home, you know, lose some." And she did... And she did, and she did, and she did till she became anorexic. I was an early case. [Ina] Then it lasted just about the exact same time... year and a half or almost three years that I was in camp. And in the end, I realized she's the exact same age also. [train rumbles] [Jack] The odds of going to Bergen-Belsen instead of to Auschwitz were 9 to 1. 90,000 people left from Westerbork to Auschwitz. Only 10,000 left to other camps. So the odds were unbelievable Ina and I came together in Bergen-Belsen again. [Ina] When we arrived at the station, there was a man whom I knew. And I asked him, you know, very excitedly, "how is it and what is this camp like and how are the people and how's the food?" And all he did was, you know, calm me down, "it's okay. It's okay. It's not so bad." [young Jack] "May 20, 1944. Inaka, my darling, now that you are here, it is as if I found peace of mind again. Everything here is much more difficult than in Westerbork. You will find that a love life is completely nonexistent. For the moment, I am glad enough just to be a very close friend of yours. It is not my intention to go through life alone. And with Manja, it will never work. I'm doing nasty work, digging under the supervision of the SS from 6:00 in the morning till 6:00 in the evening. I'm dead tired but in good health... Though that won't last long. Try to be strong, Ina. It won't be easy." [young Ina] "Dearest Jaap, a first bit of news from here. A complete nightmare. Last night with Josette in one bed, on a board without a mattress. The sanitation is indescribable I suspect you will be going to a disinfection bath one of these days. You will pass close to our fence, and that will be a real opportunity for us to talk for a moment." [Betty Knoop] I think of the people sitting at night, taking off their clothes and... Trying to kill the lice. [Ina] I just could not stand it. There was no way that you could keep anything clean. No women that I know of got their periods during the time that they were incarcerated. When we went to Westerbork, it never came. Was in Bergen-Belsen, it never came. What the reason is, nobody seems to know. Nature, somebody up there taking care of us, because it would have been a terrible, terrible situation. Impossible. [Jack] The condition in Bergen-Belsen became from bad to worse. First of all, the eating conditions became terrible. [Ina] We would get big, big kegs of soup. It was always turnip soup. [Jack] The Orthodox Jews, they refused to eat the soup because sometimes, in the soup, was a piece of horse meat. Now, to get a horse meat, you have to be unbelievably lucky. Sometimes people would, "I got it, I got it." [Ina] There were a lot of fights, and it was very often about food. [Jack] The moment people died, people would grab whatever they had, the blanket or the pillow. Unless , of course, he had family. But people were sometimes alone, and then people would grab as fast as possible what you could get. [young Jack] "My dear little lady, they asked me at my table if I' keeping a diary, and everybody asked me to write in it that they are hungry. I just tried to eat, but after two bites, I was so nauseous, I had to throw away a whole camp bowl full of food, complete, big food." [young Ina] "Jaap, dear, I share your hunger problems. We're old and decrepit and so hungry that my sense of humor is dying." [Ina] they separated the people from the diamond industry from the others, and they gave us our own barrack. It was the only group of people that didn't work, so called, to save their hands. And once, in the middle of the night, this guy opened the door. Everybody was sleeping. "Achtung!" You know, "pay attention! I want Mr. so-and-so and so-and-so," and those were all the diamond manufacturers, "to come to the office, and we'll have to discuss setting up a diamond industry." And then he yelled, "Can anybody take German shorthand?" And I and another woman both went, and we had to take minutes. I knew German shorthand, but I had never taken minutes. But one of my father's friends calmed me down and said, "I'll sit next to you, and I'll tell you what you should write down." I would say that diamonds actually saved our lives. Did you take anything with you in the camps? 'cause you gave me a broach. You told me you had it in the camps with you when you gave it to me. And I remember, like, I would keep it, you know, and then I'd say, "Oh, I can't have that near me." So I'd put it, lock it away, and then I'd take it out again. [Ina] I guess I took a pin through the camps. Didn't know what was gonna happen in the camps, you know. I took my rollers through the camps, too, and used them. We didn't know what was happening in the camps. Really? You curled your hair? Well, I wore a pageboy always. So, every night, I put four of those things in my hair. The whole time? [Ina] The whole time, I had a pageboy. Right. [Ina] And you could never wash your hair, so it might as well fall nice. Plus, you had a boyfriend. [Ina] Plus, I had a boyfriend. Yeah, well, I don't know. I was so used to it. And I kept them, and I used them. You know, I thought your obsession with your hair came later. No, no, no, no, no. That's from way back, way back. Huh. [siren blares] [young Jack] "Sweet darling, just a few words by flashlight. There are now 220 people in our barrack. So for us, it means being more careful. You and I might have to see somewhat less of each other in the near future. Last night, Manja saw us taking a walk, but she made only one sarcastic remark. 'nice weather for a walk,' she said. But my dear Inaka, know well that for Jaap, there is only on 'number one.' do you believe me, Inaka? I really hope so." [Ina] I think I was number one in his heart, but in his daily life, he had to consider her first. Manja was sometimes very nice and didn't care, especially when she had her boyfriend, the doctor. That helped a lot. So, then, you know, she had her own concerns, and she left us alone. [young Jack] "My dearest little lady, I had a long talk with Manja. This morning, two parties informed her where and when we are meeting each other. I could really kill these stupid and tactless women. In fact, her, too. People talked, "Jaap Polak and Ina Soep, they're an item. They're together." When it looked in the eyes of others like she was a jilted wife, then... she didn't behave so nicely. And so all the time, it was, you know, "She's in a good mood, she's not in a good mood. I can see you, I cannot see you." I had to apologize to Ina that I still, to the outside world, looked like the loving husband of Manja. [young Jack] "My sweetest darling, you asked me if I'm angry at you for wanting to be so daring. You don't know how terrible I felt this afternoon when I pushed you away. And I understand completely if you tell me you cried after what happened. You asked me a few days ago how I would take it if your love for someone else turned out to be stronger than it is for me. We have to know that these risks do exist because of Rudi. I will take it as a man, and you should never make an eventual decision just to avoid bringing me pain. I'm writing with a pencil stub. One good thing is that since you've become secretary, we will have no lack of paper and pencils. Darling, try to steal a pencil for me somewhere." I laughed a little about it. What is this, love letters between each other? He was so in love with Ina it was... I don't know, extraordinary. That also kept them alive because they had each other. They lived on it. [young Jack] "My dearest Inaka, you cannot imagine how great it is for me after such a long day to have the knowledge that you are here, you think of me, you love me, and at the end of the day, I can see you, even, if only for a short time. It gives me the courage I need to carry on. We will come through this, dearest Inaka. And then we can say that our will to survive was not in vain. Many, many good night kisses." [young Ina] "Dearest Jaap, just a sign of life from this camp where they leave us alone to rot like animals. The pessimists say that spotted typhus is breaking out in all the camps. [young Jack] "Remember, darling, be smart and don't get sick. I would have to violate all strict rules and set foot in barrack 17." [young Ina] "It's getting more difficult to keep in contact. But maybe today, I will somehow find a way." [young Jack] "My Inaka, I'm not at all satisfied with our mail service since I've had a letter waiting for you already since 2:00 p.m. Try to be here when the commander comes on duty but make sure to avoid Manja when she leaves the roll call square. She's positively capable of telling your papa, and I think you, too, want to avoid that. So, my darling, I hope as you finish reading these few words, you will be in Morpheus' arms, though I would prefer to be in his place." [Ina] And I had one of my camp sicknesses, typhoid attacks. It must have been at least three, four times while I was there. You can't eat. You have a very high fever. You're nauseous, and you can absolutely not eat anything. And it may last for three, four days. And then one morning, you'd wake up, it was gone. And, of course, then you were ravenous. And my sister had saved all my bread. We had tiny, little lockers. And she had saved the bread for that day she knew was coming. And when she went to get it, it was gone. Somebody had stolen it. It was not just from one day. It was like at least three days. So there was nothing for me. And she went around and asked if they could just spare a little bit of their portion, and the first one she went to was Manja, who right away, said, "Yes," and gave a good piece of her bread for me. So that was one of the nicer things that happened. [Jack] Beautiful cards. Who wrote them? Try the chair. Ohh. Feels good. [singing in Hebrew] [indistinct conversations] [Ina] Pay attention. It's the Mark of David. It's the Star of David. It's a lovely Star of David. [singing in Hebrew] What happened while you were in the camps at Passover? [Ina] Well, we tried to do it as good as we could. You didn't have books. [Ina] Did anybody have a Haggadah in camp, in our camp? [Jack] In the camp, I think there must be -- don't forget, to the concentration camp, we took all our possessions along. [Ina] Yeah, but nobody traveled with the Haggadah. [Jack] Oh, sure, we had a Dutch Haggadah. [Ina] Yeah? [Jack] Sure, they had a Dutch Haggadah. [Ina] We tried to put the symbols like a seder dish. Whatever there was. And I had a darning egg. Remember, in the olden days, we used to darn our socks? Not anymore. And I had it with me. So that was the egg, a wooden egg. So, that's how we tried to keep our sanity, I guess. [young Jack] "My dearest sweetheart, this old man of yours is getting older. I had a very disturbing night. I didn't close my eyes at all because of the lice. Also mainly because I itched all over, which is a side effect of my jaundice. I'm now seeing everything pessimistically. Let us hope that all these difficulties, which we will no doubt have to face in many forms, will be overcome by our love." [young Ina] "My always-dearest love, sweetheart, in God's name, take care of yourself so I don't have to worry about you. I want to see you again in good health. My thoughts are always with you. Kisses, Ina." [Jack] One day, I exchanged a piece of clothes for a piece of bread. I said I want to keep this bread for the last emergency if I really need it. And believe me, you needed a tremendous amount of willpower to keep a piece of bread and not eat it. And then my sister got very sick and knew I had a piece of bread and asked me for the piece of bread. And I said no to her. [clears throat] Maybe it would've helped. I don't think so. Another good friend of mine, his son got very sick and asked me for the piece of bread. And I said no. And that good friend of mine, he made it, and the son made it, and after the war, he didn't want to talk to me... For one year. After one year, he called me. [clears throat] And we were talking it out. And he more or less said, "Now after one year, although I blamed you at that time so terribly for not doing it, I still forgive you for that." [voice breaking] It was emotional. [Ina] I had a terrible, terrible toothache. And I was allowed to go into the adjacent camp, which was the women's camp, huge women's camp, only women. Most of them had come from Auschwitz. It was also the camp where anne frank was. The women all looked terrible. They were all in striped uniforms from Auschwitz, which, of course, we didn't have. And I saw the woman dentist. She was a Polish woman. And she had, like, a makeshift dental office there. So people, I don't think the Germans kind of set that up, but people tried themselves to help as much as possible. They had these huge carts, but instead of horses, they had people pulling the carts. And they were all filled up with dead bodies. They were barely bodies anymore. And I guess they were pulling them to the crematoria. And I saw heaps of them lying, you know, by the roadway, and I came back, and I was just... To our part, and I was just devastated. [Betty Knoop] How was it possible that our lives were taken away like this? How was it possible that the whole world really stood by and really didn't care? I know 11 million people were killed, not counting the soldiers. But nobody cared. I am not talking about individual people. I'm talking now about countries and governments. [Jack] 60 million people died in the second world war because we were not able to stop a crazy man. They knew in England, Churchill knew, and the Pope knew. They all knew what was happening in Germany. I thought all these people would die. I never thought anyone would come back. [young Jack] "My dear little lady, I think that in my future life, if I make it, I will be able to value even the smallest things. What do you think about our being together in a quiet little house in the winter by a hearth after a delicious meal? I almost can't imagine that there will ever be such a happiness in store for us. So, sweet child, I'm going back to my barbed wire. These are only dreams of the future." [young Ina] "My sweet darling, yesterday we had a crazy and emotion-filled day. First uncle han's funeral, how terribly shameful it was without a casket, with rough kapos throwing the body on the cart. I'm worried about my father. He has such a hard time. Why is it all taking so very long? And there are so many more victims. Soon there will be nothing left. Now, my darling, I am too depressed for anything nicer. Never say die. Ina." You didn't talk about it much when we were little. [Ina] Nobody talked about anything. I'm not accusing. It's not a ... but I had to imagine from the little tiny bits and pieces I could put together what it must have been 'cause until I got the courage to ask dad about it. [Ina] But, see, we didn't talk about it not because we couldn't. Because nobody did and nobody asked. What about with your mother? My mother did not like to talk about it because she lost her son. No, it was too emotional for her. Although I did... did I tell you I once saw her talking to Benno on the photograph? Really? I'm sorry. See, that's it. My mother was, I mean, I don't usually like to show emotions, but she was even much worse or better at it. She never, never showed much emotion at all, ever. So, that's... so she never talked about it. We never talked about it. [Ina] What I remember of my father, his biggest, biggest sorrow was the loss of my brother. When they got notice that he died, he felt all of a sudden how powerless he was that he could not even protect his own child. It was the tragedy of his life. My father wrote a poem after my brother died. "Our man, Benno." [speaking Dutch] So that's it. Defeated we are sitting down, After this, God's strongest blow. We all loved you so tenderly And weep at your grave, unknown to us. A blessing you were in our life; Your goodness shown above all. As human in such high repute, As Jew, a faithful subject. For the Netherlands you fought, And now you had to perish in this way. That must be God's decree How else to understand? In the arms of the Supreme Being, You can only rejoice. That your lovely soul, so pure, may rest Til we come close to you again. That's it. It's very difficult not to feel guilty that you survived, and you also have a feeling you never did enough to save other people. Phillip is here in this very simple grave. Resistant workers, people who have lost their lives against the Germans fighting them. I get emotional when I see the grave. So many people, my parents, my sister, they were, they perished in flames. We don't even know where their ashes went. All the other family, there are no graves to visit. [shofar blows] I had, all of a sudden, this thought that it would be a good idea to exchange our letters back to each other so that what I had written would be in my hands and what Jack had written would be in his. And my reasoning was that we had no idea what was going to happen to us. Would we stay there together? Would we be liberated together? Would he be sent away? Would I be sent away? Would one of us die? She didn't want to have strangers see her love letters, which had a lot of sense, and after the war, we hoped when we would make it, we can give them to each other. [young Ina] "My dearest love... [speaks Dutch] When you depart, quietly say 'goodbye.' Yes, my Jaap. Now it is actually coming. Exactly when, we don't know yet. This morning I found my last two house lice dead in my sweater. I can't tell you how lucky I feel to be rid of them. With this letter, my dear, I'm also thinking so much about our coming home. Where, when will we find each other again, if at all? We may be in reality returning to the Netherlands. However, we may find it easier to go to America. If I go there with my family, how will our feelings withstand this distance? Above all, what will we do if you're not liberated at the same time as we are? Oh, my young man, everything is so vague." [young Jack] "My always dearest Inaka, it is indeed not out of the question that you will go to America. And, Inaka, if you do end up there, I'm beginning to despair. I will be walking around Amsterdam with the sense that my one and only love lives in New York. And even though you wouldn't forget about me, I have an idea that you will meet men who are more interesting, who are better company, more charming than I am." [young Ina] "April 7, 1945. My dearest Jaap... Last night at 8:00 p.m. We were called for transport and had to be ready in two hours. But we are still here. I fervently hope that I will see your darling mug once more before we leave. I don't want to say 'goodbye' again to you. Just 'see you soon.' a thousand kisses, Ina." [Ina ] I write at least three or four letters. This is the last letter. It was always uncertainty till the last minute. [young Jack] "What we went through after our transport out of Bergen-Belsen cannot be described. Our whole transport suffered a very bad spot of typhus epidemic after we left. I, myself, was on the verge of death for two days, but pulled through. Same with Manja." [Jack] I mostly recall digging graves, schlepping the dead bodies from the cattle car into the grave outside the cars. I remember on April 23, 1945, seeing Russian uniforms, and I said, "This is it." I went with a group of people to get food. Then I felt suddenly very weak. Then I got into a coma. I came out of the coma on April 25. All I know is in two days my weight was down to 70 pounds. [chanting in Hebrew] [Jack] Whenever, really, I say that way, I think about the people I buried. Prayers are quite difficult for me basically because how many times can you say how great God is and then have to think about all the horrible things that happened to my parents and to my whole family? And think on the other hand, I owe God that he let me survive the holocaust. [train whistle blows] [Ina] We fInally broke into the front line, and we couldn't go any further. And all of a sudden, I see these big, burly tank guys coming over the hill in their uniforms, their helmets. They had no idea who we were. They were totally flabbergasted. They had no idea what a concentration camp was. They had never heard of it. And when they smiled, they all had these fabulous white, straight teeth and some crazy thought came in my mind, and I thought, "Well, they must have all seen the same orthodontist." And they right away took over. And as I was being lifted by these burly Americans on the truck, the bottom of my rucksack fell out. And then I vividly remember me looking at the letters and thinking, "How can I take them?" And I left them. The usual pictures. Yeah. Filled with emotion. Look at that. [Ina speaking Dutch] Does my hair look alright? Yeah. I'm Jack Polak. I'm a survivor of Westerbork and concentration camp Bergen-Belsen and been liberated by the Russian armies. I'm accompanied with my wife Ina who was with me in the camps and with whom I'm going to celebrate this weekend our 60th anniversary. [applause] I will just read to you from theuniversal declaration of human rights, articles 18 and 19. "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance." Thank you, Mr. Polak, and, Mr. and Mrs. Polak, all the very best for this very special anniversary next week. [Jack] Thank you. Wonderful. Unbelievable event... To stand in the united nations and thinking about all the people who didn't make it. [voice breaking] Also the fact that I am alive and am able to give testimony to it. [up-tempo calliope music plays] [narrator] The day is one of thanksgiving the world over. In Holland, there is real cause to cheer. The capitulation of Germany has literally saved thousands from death by starvation. Their Canadian liberators are feted, and ceremonies of thanks are held for deliverance. [Betty] The war had ended, and everybody tried to find out who has survived. I went to the red cross. I put advertisements in papers. [church bell tolling] [Ina] I had no idea that Jaap was alive, and when I was back in Holland, I had no idea if I would see him again. And he didn't know what had happened to my train. [Jack] The meeting point was Amsterdam. I had given her the name of my sister Betty, who I knew was underground. I didn't know if she was still alive. But basically for two months, Ina had no knowledge that I had made it. [cheering] [Betty] One day I heard transportshad arrived in the south of the Netherlands. But it was still very difficult to travel. So I lent a uniform of a nurse. I had a niece who was a nurse. I said, "If I go as a nurse, nothing can happen." And I hitchhiked with a big American truck, and we were on a road to enter hoeven when we were stopped because a terrible accident had passed, and they saw there was a nurse there. "Please come along immediately." And I don't know anything about nursing, never. So I came there, and I said, "this is too serious. Immediately let doctors come. I shouldn't touch those. I shouldn't touch those." And off I went with the truck. They let me in, and I saw a long line of skeletons. And I looked and I looked, and I couldn't recognize anyone. But someone was calling my name. "Betty, it's you. Betty." And I looked, and I saw my brother. And I saw a nephew. And I hardly dared to embrace them. I was afraid they would crack down. But that's where we met. [young Jack] "My dearest Inaka... What do you say about my luck? My sister Betty just came to visit me. She will hand you this little letter tomorrow. She will tell you everything. How happy I was to hear that all of you were alive, you can well imagine. Before anything else, Ina, everything is still as it was before. I hope it is with you, too. I hope that we will soon talk about everything in peace. How I long for that at last. In my thoughts, I embrace you and kiss you. Jaap." [young Ina] "My dearest Jaap, what a surprise this morning the beautiful roses and fine letter. I can find no words to express how happy I am that you are at reachable distance from me. I was beginning to panic that I still hadn't heard anything as information about several other began to trickle in. I'm very excited and nervous and almost can't wait to see you in real life and be able to embrace you. We all feel so terribly sad about the dreadful numbers of those who died. But then I am thankful that you pulled through." [Jack] And I would see myself walking from the streetcar to that house where Ina was. [Ina] We stood in front of the window waiting for him to come, and here comes this man in the most God-awful coat, which he had gotten from the red cross. I had to breathe [gasps] Like this, and I thought, "Oh, such a shabby old man. Nothing for Ina." But he looked so dreadful. He was so thin, and he looked so pale. [Jack speaking Dutch] [Ina speaking Dutch] [laughing] [Jack speaks Dutch] [Ina laughs] May I introduce myself? You make me cry, you make me cry. [Ina] She's still crying from 60 years ago. And we stood there and saw you coming, and we thought you looked about as old then when you were 32 or, yeah as -you look today. -That was the beginning of my life. Yeah, well, it was. [Jack] It was. Yeah. [Ina] And now it's 60 years later a little more 60 1/2 years later. -And now it's the end of my life. -No, come on. We can all say that. [Jack] Yeah, I know, I know. And then he had to get a divorce. [Jack] The same Rabbi who did our wedding was a friend of mine,did get Jewish divorce. [Ina] The wife is supposed to spit on the husband? [Jack] What? [Ina] Who is supposed to spit? [Jack] Uh, I think... people told us... Manja always told us... "That is okay, but I'm not going to spit." I said, "Manja, but you have to be there while the get is written by the Rabbi." She says, "How long does it take?" "I'll ask him to do it fast." [Ina] I had always claimed that I would never marry an accountant because they're the dullest people in the world. So here I ended up with a man who was 10 years older, bald, and an accountant. [tea kettle whistling] I like sugar better than sweetener. No. I'll take the sugar and the sweetener. No, you'll get the sweetener. Can I ask you when is the first time you had sex? [Ina] Oh, well, like every good Dutch Jewish girl, and any good girl at that age, the night we got married, I mean, the real sex. I mean, there was a lot going on before, but, you know, real, not till that. It just wasn't done. [Jack] I had to wait a long time for it. [both laugh] [Ina] But there are always a lot of substitute, as you well know, for young kids if they really want to. But he would, once in a while, when we had the lights out already, and he would come back late from camp, he would kind of feel his way to the barrack and would say good night. Then he probably would kiss me because it's pitch dark. And now? [Ina] Ask his cardiologist, who gets such a kick out of Jack. Every time he's been sick, he asks when he can have sex again. [Jack] Yeah. [Ina] He was so stunned, but he was so intrigued, that now every time he goes... [Jack] "Do you still have sex?" So I say, "Yes." He said he was very pleased. [Ina] There's hope. [both laugh] [bell tolling] [solemn mid-tempo music plays] [young Jack] "Thursday, October 12, 1944. My dearest darling... If we both deal with the knowledge that these few days, too, will pass, then the best that could happen would be that these few days will improve our archives, and in 26 years"... [Jack] ..."when we are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, we will write and perform the great view about our lives. Am I not an optimist?" And I tell her that she's still beautiful. [glass clinking] [Jack] Okay. [Ina] "Being married to Jack hasn't brought one single dull moment yet. [laughter] He gave me 60 years of happiness, harmony, and unconditional love. It all started on 1/29/46, and we lived happily ever after." [applause] [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] [Ina] Condition. [dog barking] [Jack speaking indistinctly] [Ina] In the studio, and they have it prerecorded. [Jack] Oh, yeah. [Ina] You're so pretty. You're so pretty. I'll hang up... [Jack] Let's get organized now, okay? I don't know how... [speaking Dutch] [Ina laughs] [laughing] [singing in German] [big band music plays]
