Captions Provided By Cinephile Media 'Raj Mahal', such a splendid mansion. l'll tell you the tales of the people who stayed in it. Shabbu Dada... Raj Babu, my master! You've come! lt's good you came. l had to come Dada. Your telegram forced me to come. Come inside. The dead body has been there for 24 hours. Rani is still waiting for you. Have a look at your sister for the last time. Come on. She's dead but she still seems proud and alive. The proud head and the raised eyebrows are same as before. The anger and ego she had when she was alive, can be seen even now. Anyway, now l have no complaints with my dead sister. But Shabbu Dada, the people have not forgiven her. Maybe that's the reason no one has come to mourn her death. No one has stepped in this house in the last 25 years And Rani also didn't feel the need to socialize with anyone. ln such a big house she used to wander alone like a mad woman. Till she died she said that only she would rule her father's home. Her rule was the reason for the destruction of this house. Anyway, now what's the use of thinking about the past? Go and make arrangements for her last rites. You've become silent. The queen who ruled this house has become silent forever. The people will forget everything... but they will never forget our sorrowful tale. Your childhood... your anger... and your ego. l told you many times not to enter my room without my permission! l'm sorry. l'm an old woman. l've become crazy. We'll have to repair your brains! What is it? Child, the master has called you. Don't call me child! l'm not your daughter! Stupid woman! - What's happening? - Move aside or the horse will jump. Stupid! Dada, even you're behaving like a child! Come, father calls us! - Did you call us? - Yes. Go in that room with your brothers. l'm coming. - Who is that girl? - How should l know? - She's so innocent. - So what? - She's so beautiful. - So what? My children... l want to tell you, henceforth in this house, with you all... an orphan girl will also be brought up. - Orphan girl? - ls this house an orphanage? This house has prospered due to the prayers of the orphans and poor. ls her mother also dead like our mother? My son, this ill-fated girl's father is also dead. - The innocent girl is helpless. - Poor thing. Wait, l'll bring her in. Come child. Don't be afraid child. From today, this is your home. Meet your sister. Her name is Shushila Rani... but we call her Rani with love. She rules this house. - Greetings. - Greetings! His name is Kundan. He's younger than Rani but he's very quiet. Greetings. And his name is Raj. He's very naughty and smart. - Greetings. - Greetings to you. Rani, lndra will sleep in your room tonight. ln my room? But why? Because your room is next to mine and l want to look after her. Where will l sleep? There are many rooms in this big house. Take her to your room. - l won't do that! - Rani! lt's my order! Send her to our room. We brothers will sleep in some other... No! She'll sleep in the same room! Come! Go child. Take rest. - The poor thing is hesitant. - The poor thing is afraid. Why are you walking in style? Walk faster! l permit you to sleep here only for tonight! But on the floor, not on the bed! Understood? Yes. One more thing! The light will not be on the whole night. Child, now you play with Raj and l'll prepare the breakfast. Okay? Good girl. - Flowers. - Thank you. - Did you get scared in the night? - No. - Did you get sleep? - Yes. - ls your name lndra or lndra Devi? - lt's lndra. Your name is very nice. - Greetings. - Greetings. Daddy told us to keep you happy, so l've brought this book. You'll enjoy reading this book. You both are very nice, but l don't know how to read. - l'll teach you. Do you know how to play the piano? - A little bit. Good, come. You're not well and you went out in the rain. lt's okay, Shambhu. Enough. l heard the sound. Why are you beating it so much? l did it for them! The breakfast is getting cold and they're playing! Then go and call them. Why get upset? What a problem! Are you all deaf or crippled? Can't you hear the breakfast bell? When did the bell ring? One day you'll get thrashed badly! Come on, daddy is waiting! You also come. What are you looking at? Come on! You play the piano very well. You'll have to teach Rani too. No. l don't want to learn the piano. Rani sister doesn't want to learn anything except anger. - Raj! You're very bad! - Rani, you behave very badly! Quiet, you miscreant! - What is wrong with you both? - Maniac! Come back Rani! l've observed that your behavior is very irritating. lf you nurse this ego and anger... this happy home will be destroyed one day. You're telling me but you didn't shout at him... who made fun of me in front of a stranger. lndra is not a stranger in this house! How dare you call her a stranger! She is a stranger! She came and snatched my room, my brothers... and my happiness! She's a stranger! Quiet! ls this the reward of my love? Begone! The family had to pay a very heavy price for this slap. The sick father's heart suffered after slapping his dear daughter. The doctor's treatment, Raj and Kundan's tears... orphan lndra's prayers and all the efforts were made... but the stubborn girl wasn't affected... and kept mourning and nursing her insult. When the angel of goodwill died... moments after his last rites... she again became impatient to impose her will. Get out of here you witch! Now you can't stay in this house! Stop sister! No! No one can stop me. Our father died because of her! l'll thrash her! - But we'll protect her. - We'll save her, you can't hit her! Move aside you rogue! Wait! Why are you fighting? Child, stop being angry, this girl is innocent. Shambu Dada! Child, it's your duty to obey your late father. Master brought her in this house to save her from this harsh world. Child, the dead man's soul will be restless. Child, be a little peaceful. Come. One sock is black and the other is white. This pair is also the same. The one who made them is foolish. The one who is wearing them is foolish. The white pair is mine and the black pair is yours. ls that so? Okay. The shoes are ready. - Bring them soon, l'm in a hurry. - ln a hurry? But why? Where are you both going? Won't you have food? We'll have food after we return. There's a drama at our college. Drama? Yes drama. We'll be late, you stay awake. Please see if lndra is ready. l've been ready but you're not. lt's 8 PM! Hurry up! We are hurrying. ln this rush my shoe lace broke. What a problem! You tie your laces, l'll take sister's permission. Wait! Don't ask sister else we'll not be able to see the drama today. - But... - No buts. l'll handle it. Dada, please take these clothes. Brother Kundan, hurry up! Where are they? Won't they have dinner? They've gone to college. They'll return later and eat. - College? At night? - There's a drama at their college. Drama? You've come into my heart, as its only wish l thank you Let's dance Let's sing You are the song and l'm your melody l'm the voice of your heart l looked for you... you looked for me... sometimes in spring and in autumn. But be cautious You are my world and you desire me l thank you Let's dance Let's sing Please don't make my heart flutter No one knows my love Our talks... and the heart's wishes... l hope they're not heard by the people. So be cautious You're the only one in my heart, and you'll always remain so l thank you Let's dance Let's sing Where is sister? - Where is sister? - She's sleeping. - Did her temperature rise? - Yes. 120 degrees. 120! Now what will happen? Don't worry. There's no need to be scared. Sister won't eat us. Change clothes, eat food and sleep. Tomorrow you'll see my wonder. Turn on the light. Ghost! Ghost's brother, so you've come? Sister... Yes, your sister. l thought you all went see the drama. But now l know that you were enacting the drama. Yes sister. Brother was the prince of Baghdad and l was the thief. Quiet you rogue! Did this princess sing and dance before everyone? The audience was enthralled. The curtain was dropped and raised. lt was a charity show, so we thought you wouldn't mind this good work. You are wrong. This foolish girl has marred our family's respect. Henceforth, she won't go to college. Okay. Even l and Kundan brother have said goodbye to the college. Come on. Go to your room. Stupid girl. We both were saved but poor lndra will suffer. ls that so? Then this thief of Baghdad will rescue his princess. lf you live in a decent home, learn to be decent! l'm sorry sister, please forgive me. Forgive you? Stupid girl. - Who is it? - The thief of Baghdad. Open the door. - Are you unhurt? - Yes. - Did your neck break? - No. - You must have got 2 or 3 slaps. - No. l was saved. Saved? Thank you, God. What are you looking at? l can see the moon of Baghdad shining in lndia. ls the moon different in Baghdad? - Yes! - How is that? lt's just like you. The difference is that it has a flaw... and you're flawless. - You're good at flattery. - You're good at blushing. Please go. Sister is awake. To make this sister sleep, l'll have to bring a special medicine. Go now. ls she okay? You took very long. You don't know, l reached just in time. Rani's one hand was on lndra's neck and the other hand had a stick! - Stick? - Yes, stick! l snatched it and made pieces of it! Rani asked, who is that? l said, 'l'm the thief of Baghdad'! Rani got very angry and so did l! l locked her in the bathroom. Here are the keys. Take, we'll see her in the morning. - You both are still awake. - Sister, we're not getting sleep. Here is the tablet and the water is there. Have it. - What tablet is this? - lt's a sleeping tablet. - For sleep? This is necessary to stop your nonsense. Take it! Go! Have it! Stupid! What's this nonsense? You're disturbing the whole house! Sister, today l've become a pilot. Here's the plane. Sit, l'll take you for a ride. You're crazy! You've become mad. lf l do or don't do anything, it's a problem. lt's true, l'm a pilot. This is my uniform and this is my cap. This is how you salute. Tomorrow is Sunday and l've to go on duty on Monday. You're ready so soon. lt's not even 9 AM. l've to get a photo taken. l'm a pilot officer. l'm not jobless like you. Bye! Bye! You've worn the uniform and are looking good. But fix your brainsn too. You must behave like an officer. - Sister, you should wear this uniform. - Again the same nonsense! Here's the flag of peace! Don't say anything today. Please bless me. God bless you. Stupid! Thank you. You look very good in this uniform. lt's not easy to be a pilot officer. But something is missing. What? Missing? Wait. lt smells so nice. lt seems the scent of your hair is in it. - Go for your duty. - Let the duty be. Now l can't go any further. l'll make you go. Oh my God! - What was happening here? - Nothing sister. - l can see that you're misbehaving these days. - Misbehaving? Yes! l gave you this necklace to put in the safe but you broke it! - Necklace? Sister, l didn't break your necklace. - You're lying! You may not remember, this necklace got stuck in your hair and broke. Anyway, take it to Hirachand Jewelers and get it repaired. Very well. - You! - Where are you going? - To repair sister's necklace. Sister is too much! She sent you in the rain! Your clothes are all wet! When l left home it was sunny. Then it rained and now it's sunny again. What can l do? This is the rainy season. You can't say when it'll rain. lf you fall sick, it'll be bad. Come on, sit in the car. What are you looking at? - l'm seeing the drops of water on your beautiful face. - So? They look very nice. - lf someone sees us? - He'll be jealous. - You're very naughty. - Whatever, but l'm very lucky. - Fate has given this nice chance. lndra... - Yes? - The rain has stopped. - So? My desires are soaring. Come, l'll take you for a ride. No. l've to get sister's necklace repaired. Till the jeweler repairs it, l'll take you around. Okay? Whoopee! This rainy season and you and l My heart is beating You brought love along with you You brought the Spring into the garden See the flowers are smiling and the clouds are dancing with joy There's no sorrow when you're with me My heart says let's go to a place where there's Spring every day You and l should be there and a sweet music Only our voices must echo there And we'll sing together l've filled all the colors... but where can l get that color... with which nature has made your beautiful face? - l got scared. - Scared? Looking at me? lndra, why did you get scared of me? l wasn't scared of you. l thought it was sister. l know you live in this house in the shadow of sister's fear. But you must rid yourself of this fear. - Yes. - Where did you go to get wet in this rain? l went to repair sister's necklace. lf this necklace is put on your neck, then? What? l don't think l'm worth it. You're right. Before your beauty... these pearls have no value. The college days were so good. Now it feels like Rani sister has clipped our wings. Come, let's sit and relive the memories of our childhood. Your family supported me, educated me and gave me every happiness. With the mercy of your family, l forgot that l'm an orphan. ln this lovely mansion, l do what l feel l like. l've been waiting four hours and you're sitting here. Sister, the necklace is ready. She got wet in the rain for it. Thank her. l must also thank her for spoiling the sofa with her wet clothes! Sister, you get upset over everything. Now l've grown up. Please don't shout at me like this. lf l hadn't cared for you, you'd have been nowhere! Go and change your clothes. Stupid! l don't know what happiness you get in hurting her. Quiet! l don't like you interfering in the matters of the house. Today l'm very happy! l'm again with all my friends, but there's one man missing. Kundan brother, Rani sister, why didn't Raj come? Raj is crazy about flying planes. Your friend is a pilot officer now. He's gone on duty. l've come after 10 years from abroad and he's doing duty! l'll call him right now! ls this a man's voice or a woman's? Aunt, who do you want? - l want you. - Me? Can l ask your name? You want the name! You're very stupid. Be careful about what you say else l'll tell the police. Explain this to your wife, too, who flirts on the phone. l'll talk to my wife later. First l'll ask you. l returned after 10 years abroad and you didn't come to meet me? You're very bad! Okay so it was Mr. Ramesh speaking in a woman's voice. Friend, did you go abroad to become a barrister or... Don't fool Raj, we're waiting for you. Mr. Barrister, l'll be there definitely by 4 PM. Kundan and Rani sister are here. We'll have tea together. Okay? Very well Mr. Barrister. l heard that. Kundan and Rani are there and lndra is alone in the house. Raj is coming. You all must have tea before going. Sir, l'm not lying. The pain starts from here and increases this way. l feel l'll get a heart attack. Do you want to go home? l'll take some medicine and sleep. l'll be fine by tomorrow. You can go. This atmosphere and this loneliness Please come for a little while This atmosphere and this loneliness This is a good opportunity to meet Please extinguish the fire in my heart This is a good opportunity to meet lt's true With great difficulty... today l'm playing the music of my love On this melody please come... and sing a song This atmosphere and this loneliness lt's true Everything is here... except your love, my dear This life is not forever Please come and spend a few happy moments with me This atmosphere and this loneliness You? When did you arrive? Six hours ago. Then you must be tired. Should l massage your legs? No. lf your wrist gets sprained, l'll have to call a doctor. Do you think l'm delicate? No, l think you're Mr. lndia. Your iron-like fingers will hurt my soft flesh. l'm very delicate. You talk very well. l think you can't concentrate on your work. How can l concentrate? You're in my heart... in my eyes and in my breaths. Love must be like this. But why did you stain your face with ink? So that my beautiful face is protected from all evil eyes. Let me take it as a kohl and apply it in my eyes. l'll apply it. Raj is his own master. He won't come now. lt's 6 PM. Friend, please call for the tea. lndra, my heart aches to be away from you. l feel like sitting before you day and night and worshiping you. The day will begin and the night falls. Again the day will begin and the night will fall. The God of love is dancing in your eyes. Wait, l'll do something to please him. My lover looks so handsome. Should l show you the mirror? l don't need the mirror. l can see my reflection in your glowing face. Move away. l moved away. lndra, if you can look at my palm and tell my fate... then please tell me what is written in my fate. - A beautiful girl. - No. A bright moon. A moon, whose light has enlightened my life. lf l'm the light, then what are you? l'm the moth who is crazy for this light. - Sister! - We're dead! Oh my God! l'm dead! So you're here. Sister, my stomach is paining. l came here to have medicine. Medicine? You look like a mad man. Go and change your clothes. Okay, but my stomach... Wait. Come here. - What? - Come here! Where did you learn to act like a thug? Stupid! Go! - lndra - Yes? What are you thinking? You didn't comb your hair or wear good clothes. You look strange today. No reason. You're the pride of this house. You must always dress nicely. lf you need new clothes, you can tell me. l'm so lucky that you care for me so much. How can l tell you, how happy l feel to do something for you. Ramesh Babu. Please come in. Are you fine? Yes, Dada. Where is that king of liars? l was tired of waiting and he didn't come to meet me! - Who is this? - Put on your specs and see. lsn't she lndra? - Yes. Greetings. - Amazing! She's become so big. - Do you have any problem? - No l don't. l'm praising her. Who are you praising Mr. Barrister? You've worn a lovely suit. Yes. This was stitched in Paris. - From Paris? Great! - Go away. l don't want to talk to you. l feel you learned this anger also in Paris. Let's embrace each other. No, you're very bad. Please agree. Raj, what's this nonsense? Nothing sister, we met after a long time. Meeting him is like getting the world. - Right friend? - Yes friend. He was dying to meet me. This is called love. - Right friend? - Yes friend. l'll tell you later how much l've suffered in your absence. - First tell me when is the party? - Tomorrow. l've come to give the invitation. But you all have to come. - lndra, please don't forget. - Me? No excuses will do. Sister, you'll have to bring her along. Very well. She'll definitely come. - May l come in? - Yes, you may. Do you want to say something? l want to say the same thing as before. Girls must be married. You must think about your marriage. l've answered your question before. But today l want to know your decision. Before my late master, l had taken the responsibility... and before my death l want to fulfill it. You don't need to worry. l know what's good for me. Then why do you refuse marriage? For how long will you be a spinster? As long the rules of your society don't change. Child, it's impossible to change the rules of the society. Then think that my marriage is also impossible. May l know the reason for this hatred? lt's because the men of this country take a woman as a slave... and l don't want to be a slave to my husband. lt depends on one's thinking. What you call slavery, society calls the duty of a woman. A woman who lives her life for her husband is honored by society. l don't want to be honored. You may go now. Very well. But please think again. Just once more. lt seems this pilot officer is now in the army. No, l've just tried to please my love. l'm flattering her. Why flatter her? Because there's a party at Ramesh's home and my stomach will ache again. lt's again going to ache? l understood. You won't go to the party today. - Sister! - Sister? A medicine to keep the temper cool. ln any weather, young or old... intelligent or foolish, this medicine works like magic. Sister, l got the medicine l've been looking for. Listen to this. 30 gms papaya, 30 gms almonds, 30 gms brinjals... 30 gms 'karela'. lf you mix all this and massage the head, the temper remains cool. To cool your head l have another medicine. Go to work. - Today is Sunday. - lt's Monday, not Sunday. Monday? Then l must leave. Wait. Today there's a party at Ramesh's place. l know that. Bye! Stupid! To curb Raj and lndra's growing love... l must take the advantage of today's party. Ramesh is a fashionable man. lt's possible that lndra's beauty and dressing will impress him. lf l'm successful... then my brother can be free from the web of that stupid girl. We have to be at Ramesh's house at 4 PM and you're not dressed. Sister, l won't go to the party. l feel shy. Shy? Don't forget that l've promised Ramesh. Take this sari and these ornaments. You must dress well for the party. lt's a matter of our respect. - Sister... - Dress immediately. They came in my house. lt's a blessing from God. My house looks beautiful with their presence. l welcome you. Your house is beautiful but l can't see any guests at your party. Those who l cherish, have come. l don't care if others come or not. - Come mother. - Greetings mother. Raj Babu. You've come early from work today. Dada, my stomach is paining. l've come to have the medicine. Did you have the medicine? Dada, l'm looking for the medicine. l don't know where it is. Rani has taken your medicine along with her to Ramesh's place. So is sister's stomach going to ache? l don't know but if you look at lndra today, you'll be astonished. - Really? - l swear. - That's enough. What happened child? Nothing. The car's tire is punctured. Great, my friend. You made a fool of us. You said, it'll be a great party. Many things will happen. You were boasting so much, but there was nothing except a snake. Our time got wasted. lt's no use dancing before a blind man. You won't understand art. What was there to understand in it? lf there was a good dance... or a lovely song, l would have seen it. Then you can display your talent. The piano is ready. Your piano barely works. How can sing? Great. Friends, today Mr. Raj has insulted my piano at the party. ls there anyone here who will play it? - lndra will play it. - What? No sister. Please play it. lt's a matter of my respect. - Get up lndra. You must not refuse at such occasions. - But... No buts. You'll have to play the piano and sing a song. Get up. Oh flower please tell me, who is your beloved? Who is the one who has taken your heart? ln this gathering.... everyone has... experienced love They feel the pain of love in their hearts Who is the one who has become yours forever? Who is the one who has taken your heart? Oh flower please tell me The feelings of the heart... couldn't be expressed Why did the eyes feel shy looking at someone? Express the feelings of your heart. No one is a stranger here Who is the one who has taken your heart? Oh flower please tell me That was great! We enjoyed it! l have no words to praise her. Her voice is as sweet as... Sweet meat. l never heard such a song in China or Japan or France or England. But you heard it only in lndia. Right? Today's party was memorable. l liked lndra's song more than the dance. Thank you. You're saying this, sister? l'm surprised. What is worthy, has to be praised. What do you both think about Ramesh? He's fair and is good natured. He looks like a bear. He sleeps during the day and is awake at night. What else? You're very stupid. l want to know his qualities. l did tell you his qualities. But why do you want to know? Because he's a good man and he respects me. Good men have good friends. There's a lot of difference. You could learn something from him. Ramesh's mother is very nice. You, too, must learn something from her. - Stupid...! - Help! He's young but talks big! Open the door. lndra, open the door. No, l'm going to change clothes. No, l want to see you in that dress. Please open the door soon. You're very impatient. You can't wait for a little while. Who wouldn't be restless after seeing the beauty of the moon? - You show the glory of this world. - You know how to flatter very well. The flower thinks that the bee hovers around it for honey. But the flower never asked the bee... why it was so crazy for it? You know what l felt in that party? What did you feel? Your smile kindled my heart like a fire and your look wounded my heart. Very bad. The poor heart suffered so much. You keep piercing my heart without any fear. lt's my life and it's my poor heart. Why have you become so poetic today? l'm trying to melt a heart of stone. lndra, today l want to hear what you've decided about my fate. What do you think about me? l just met you for the first time. How can l decide now? Let me be close to you so l can know you, test you and then answer. Okay. So in your opinion l'm an animal of a new breed. - Yes. - Yes? Wait! This love will shake the foundation of this house. l don't know what to do. Today my buried desires have come to the surface. For how long can l hide this love and please myself with your picture? My heart is fluttering with thoughts of someone. Someone is slowly becoming a part of my life. You're still awake. Don't you want to sleep? Someone has taken away my sleep. l want to ask you something. - What? - So what if she's an orphan? But l want to marry lndra. l like the girl too, but will they agree? Raj and Kundan will be very happy and you can make Rani sister agree. - l'll try. - But when? When l get the chance. Now you must sleep. You sleep. l'll sleep later. My heart... l'm pleasing my heart with your picture My heart... There's a moon in this house There's a moon shining in this house My heart... What wealth... What more wealth can l ask from my fate? Love is the greatest blessing... Love is the greatest blessing l have ever received My heart... l'm pleasing my heart with your picture Oh my heart... When you're in my thoughts... When you're in my thoughts, l have nothing to do with this world ln your thoughts... ln your thoughts l've forsaken this world l'm pleasing my heart with your picture l'm pleasing my heart My heart... Even after my death your love... will always be with me Your love... l've taken the oath of your love l'm pleasing my heart with your picture l'm pleasing my heart My heart... Now Ramesh loves lndra. l only need to encourage Ramesh. lt's my duty to save the respect of my family. But l'll have to do this with love, not with force. What's this? The union of fire and water? Where are you going? We're going to the market to buy some good saris for lndra. Saris? Surprising. Good we met you. We were going to your house. And we, too, were coming to your place after doing the shopping. - ls everything okay? - l wanted to invite you for lndra's birthday. Thank you. We'll be very happy to come. l hope lndra is protected from evil eyes. She looks like a fairy today. - l've come to select dresses for her. - Let me help you. Come mother. What's the matter? Both brothers look very happy today. Dada, you also dance. The structure of this house has changed. The structure has changed? But where? How did it change? l can't see a change in anything. Your old eyes need specs. Rani sister's behavior has changed. lndra's fate has changed. ls that so? What's happening? - What? - What's this nonsense? Not nonsense. We're praising you. l heard you bought very nice saris for lndra. Yes. You'll be amazed to see them. l was amazed to hear the news. Now l just want to see their colors. Be careful, they're expensive saris. They may get damaged. Don't worry, l'll clean my hands. Oh no! l didn't expect this. You bought such a pathetic sari for the poor girl. There's no lace, no glitter and even the color is pale. What? How is this possible? Listen to me and take them back. Give her a few old dresses like the one she's wearing. - They may have been switched. - l'll believe you but my heart doesn't. They were definitely switched. You're surprised and so were we. Mother's sari has come here and her saris are there. - Here is your sari. - Show it to Raj who was making fun of me. You were making fun of her? Please take mister. Please give madam. Tell me the truth. How much did you spend? Who are you to ask? - Did you buy it on credit? Haven't you paid the bill? - Stupid! - This is a gift from me to lndra. - Gift? - Why gift? - For lndra's birthday. - Birthday? - lndra's birthday. Yes. lndra's birthday. The birthday is tomorrow but the party is on Sunday. Please bring your mother to the party. Definitely. l wish such a birthday was every day. Okay, l'll leave now. Shambu Dada, please take the saris. Let's go. How did she change so quickly? We didn't know lndra's birthday was being celebrated. lt's strange. Dada, please give this book to lndra. Okay. - What is it? - Nothing. l'm going to give this book to lndra. Let me see what book it is. Take it. lndra, you're the queen of my dreams. For 12 years l've hidden my love. Your smile is my life... and your tears are like death to me. l'm living in the hope that you're only mine. But today, Rani sister's changed behavior is scaring me.

Only once, please put your hand on my heart... and assure my desires that you're only mine. No! l can't do that! Please don't refuse and hurt my heart. For 12 years l've been worshiping you. But what you want, belongs to someone else. l want justice. l have more right to you than Ramesh does. Ramesh? No, it's Raj. My younger brother? Yes. We've loved each other since childhood. Brother, please fulfill my wish. l want only to be Raj's wife. You have changed my feelings. l wish you and Raj all the best. l bless you that your married life will be happy forever. Your blessing is like the blessing of God. You really are an angel. l'm very sorry for loving you without knowing your feelings. lf possible, please forgive me. Please don't say that. l respect you. - Can you give me a promise? - Tell me. Raj is immature. He may misunderstand if he learns of this. l won't be able to face... Believe me, as long as l live l'll never tell about this to anyone. May God fulfill all your wishes. Heres Kundan... And there's Raj... This clever girl has made both the brothers crazy for her. The drum plays and everyone dances. l've brought a gift to kindle the flame of love. Brother Kundan. Please forgive me. l was dancing in my joy. You know what will happen in this house today? lndra's birthday. And my gift is this expensive necklace. When she wears this necklace and come down these stairs... my heart will say on every step, l'm crazy for you... my dear, you're a wonder made by God. And this wonder is because l love her. Yes love. l'm going to tell sister about it today. You'll have to speak on my behalf. Definitely. l pray that auspicious day comes very soon. That auspicious day is here. You wait. l'll offer this gift and return. Good morning and greetings! Happy birthday and here is your gift. - Please take this necklace. - lt's great! lt's made of pearls gold, diamonds and the brightness of the moon. The jeweler has put all the beauty of the earth and sky in this. Great. ln China, Japan, Russia, England and in this entire world... there's no piece of workmanship like this and never will be! Great. When you wear it you'll be happy like a bride. Great! Do you know anything else except saying this? Come here. Sit down. My bride is a special wonder. Her waist is thin and her neck is slender. lt feels as if the moon is wearing a beautiful ornament. - Did you see your beauty? - My beauty is with you. My heart is beating very fast My eyes are sparkling Oh, my heart keep singing and creates a magic Be merry with happiness Look into my eyes, take away my heart and make me yours My head is spinning. - You're very bad. - Spinning? See, this spinning of the head won't do! The to-be wife of a pilot officer must be strong-hearted. Understood? Think that after our marriage you're flying with me over Bombay. The jet takes off and there it goes, through the clouds... cutting the air and the plane is flying at 15,000 feet! Sometimes it's up, sometimes down, sometimes here, sometimes there! Stop the plane! My head is spinning. Again it's spinning. With your spinning, l'm facing a problem. - What problem? - Sister's problem. How will l talk to her about our marriage? All you need is courage. Tell her what you feel. Okay, l'll tell her that you want to marry me. - Oh no! Don't use my name! - Why? Are you scared? You're scared of your sister, right? That must be someone else. l'll go right now and get her answer! Hail sister and hail her pure thoughts! People get their wishes by bathing in holy rivers... but l get mine by seeing my sister and being at her holy feet. - Greetings sister. - What's this drama? Not drama sister. l swear, everyone is praising your goodness. You're having such a grand celebration for lndra's birthday. - Tell me what you mean. - What l mean is that l and lndra... l mean that l and lndra... l mean, we've had a dream. That dream will never come true. l know very well about the drama going on in this house. Drama? That means you know everything. Then l'll have to say clearly. Sister, l want to marry lndra. Quiet, you stupid man! Aren't you ashamed to mention this nonsense to me? Marriage isn't bad. You should have been happy to hear this. Both the brothers have ruined my happiness! The devious girl flirts with both you and Kundan! Enough! l didn't know that hatred has made you so hard hearted. You've always hated lndra but... aren't you ashamed to blame your saint-like brother? Foolish boy. lf you want to see the deed of your brother... look at the bangles of love that lndra is wearing. Your thinking is so low. You didn't mind the saris given by Ramesh... but you're against the gift given by brother Kundan? Why not? For my two brothers and the respect of this family... l forfeited my life. l've sacrificed everything and... this is the way you're repaying me? Read this love letter... which your saint-like brother has written to his dream woman. And if you don't believe this, then ask that chaste woman... who is spreading her web in this house like a spider. l'll definitely ask her. lf they both love each other, l'll sacrifice my love! lndra, tell me the truth. What is your relation with Kundan? Yes, Kundan! The one who's crazy for you and for your beauty! Are you in your senses? Go and find out the truth. You're acting like a chameleon and changing the subject! Beautiful woman, l know your deceit very well. You promised love to me and to Kundan! Raj, your mind has been poisoned against me. And you're innocent? Tell the truth. Are these bangles a symbol of love? Don't make fun of a helpless woman. You're insulting my love! Your love is fake! Your love is two faced! Answer my question! Your question is so absurd that l feel it a sin to answer it! Very well! Then l'll ask Kundan! No! l won't let you go to Kundan! Why? Because your deceit will be revealed? l'll definitely go. lf you want to go, you'll have to go over my dead body! l won't see Kundan being insulted! You won't see Kundan being insulted? Shameless! Cheat! Unfaithful! Move aside! - Kundan brother! - Where are you going? - He's just left for Pune. - Pune! No he can't go to Pune! You loved me and went away from me You didn't think or understand and became upset You repaid my sincerity with doubt ln just a moment you changed You loved me and went away from me You didn't think or understand and became upset ln this world, who can l call as my own... when you have turned away from me? You have turned away from me You loved me and went away from me You didn't think or understand and became upset Stop this nonsense and mourning! Who is dead that you're crying? Your soul and my fate. You're the one to kill them. You! Quiet you stupid girl! You insulted me in my own house. Apologize! No! For 12 years l kept quiet and tolerated your atrocities! But your heart of stone doesn't melt. There's a limit to patience. l asked you, l begged before you, but you never felt pity! l kept my respect at your feet but you insulted that too! You even destroyed my life and l kept quiet. Ungrateful woman, lower your eyes when you speak to me! You've lived at my mercy. To break your ego, one day life will hit you so badly... that your head held high in ego will be lowered! Stupid girl! l'll pull out your tongue! You did all the harm that you could do to me. Now l'm not afraid of you! Now l won't be afraid of you! How dare you! Get out of this house! l too have a right on this house like you do. l won't go! You won't go? We'll see about that! - Child Rani, be a little patient. - Throw this woman out of the house! This witch is enticing Raj and Kundan! She's shaking the foundation of this house! l'll make everything okay. Child, go to your room. lll-fated lndra, these three gifts are the cause of your destruction. Give them back. Give them back. Who is it? - Who was it? - l don't know. What's this bag doing here? - Saris? - These are the same gifted saris. There's some problem. Who is that woman? lndra? You're in this condition? Where are you going so late in the night? What's the matter? l'm asking you. You're silent, with tears in your eyes and your state is distressed! You're definitely in some distress. Come home with me. No! l won't let you go in this state! There's no need to inquire so much. lndra came to this house of her own will and has left on her own. lf you like her, you can marry her. l'll be happy to see you happy. Thank you. l was wondering what the matter was. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! l've brought gifts from Delhi... oh my dear mother...! Let me see. Raj met with an accident! Yes. He's been admitted to Pune Civil Hospital. He's serious. He's serious! Doctor, l'll be obliged if you let me meet my brother for one minute. The patient is very serious so l can't permit you to meet him. You'll have to wait. - l'll have to wait? - Yes. Why have you come here? To see Raj. l got the news of his accident. You're the cause of this accident. lt's due to your arrogance and ego! Stop this nonsense! Your control no longer works on me. We brothers always respected you... obeyed you but you never lived up to the duty of an older sister. You felt pity for no one! lt seems you want to rebel. What wrong have l done? You disobeyed your father's will. You broke a poor woman's heart. You turned brother against brother but you weren't satisfied. Now you're here to sprinkle salt on our wounds? You're defaming me before strangers. l'm not used to hearing this! Apologize before everyone! You're the one who should apologize to me, Raj and that orphan girl! Stupid man! You'll be punished for this defiance! You can't go in! l won't let you go near Raj! Who are you to stop me? He's my brother. But you're a butcher, not a sister! Go from here! l said go! l won't! l won't go without meeting Raj! This is my decision! Listen to my decision! l'll not even let your shadow fall on Raj! We brothers want nothing to do with you! Really? Yes! Know that Raj and Kundan are dead for you! Very well. You also think that l'm dead for both of you! Henceforth the doors of that house are closed to you both! Your name is on my lips... and thoughts of you are in my heart My beloved, please come back. My life is in turmoil The outcome of love was what it was going to be The moon of my wishes... is hidden among the dark clouds Now there's only darkness... on my love My beloved, please come back. My life is in turmoil lt remained... as a plea... that tale of love l'm here with your sorrow in my heart Yes l'm here My dear, l don't know where you are My beloved, please come back. My life is in turmoil - Sister, how is Raj? - He is dead! Raj is dead! All of you go! l don't need anyone's sympathy! Shambu, ask them to go and close the door! l won't meet anyone! What's the matter? You look disturbed. Don't ask mother. l have very bad news. Bad news? How is Raj now? - Raj is dead. - Raj died! What are you saying? l'm telling the truth. He died because of Rani's arrogance. What arrogance? Ma, Raj and lndra loved each other but Rani didn't like this. Raj and lndra loved each other? Lie down. You need rest. l'll get rest only when l see you and lndra happy. lndra doesn't love me, she loves you. Even l thought the same, but your letter... l did write that letter to lndra and it was my biggest mistake. l didn't know how much you both loved each other. She's yours and wants to live only for you. But the misunderstandings that arose because you went away... how will they be resolved? lndra's misunderstanding l cleared before leaving home. l want to assure you too. God knows that l have only pure feelings for lndra. Then why did you leave home? l left home because Rani had tried to humiliate me before you. And for me it's better to die than to live a life of humiliation. Rani is our enemy, not our sister. You'll have to come home with me. No Raj. Now l'll never go in that house. l tell you too, if you want to be happy... take lndra and go somewhere far. So far away where Rani's despotism can't reach. Where two people in love won't be tortured. Let Rani live in that house alone. She's blind in her ego. Despotism has driven her crazy. One day that house will haunt her and she'll roam in it like a loony. Time is up. The patient needs rest now. Don't be sad my child. God will soon make you well. Be patient. Now what will l do by living? There's no one in this world for me. We are yours. Don't treat us as strangers. To see you happy, we'll do everything. An orphan girl whose fate has gone against her... can't live as a burden. You're not a burden but our joy. l'll give you every happiness. l'm thinking one thing... and you're thinking something else. Your betterment is in what l'm thinking for you. We have to bow before God's will. Take, have this medicine. What are you thinking? l'm wondering if the broken heart will be able to live. You're ignorant. Time heals all wounds. But lndra is hurt badly. She might not recover. l'll make her all right. l have the medicine to cure your lndra. My lndra? What are you saying? l'm saying your wish. God has given you the lndra you loved. You're taking advantage of a helpless girl. lndra belongs to Raj! Raj is dead and l want to save her from this world! She can't live here as a spinster! lf people defame her, even our family's respect will be marred! People will malign us! So you want to poison her life because of this society? One day this poison will bring peace in her disturbed life. Don't be in a hurry. Don't decide without knowing lndra's will. This decision is for her good. You and l also wanted this. lndra needs support to live her life. Bring this medicine soon. Raj Babu! You're alive? Yes Dada, l'm alive. Fate has given me another chance. But how did the news of your death spread? There must a purpose behind it. Whatever Rani sister does, is less! Where is Kundan? This house is alien for Kundan. l, too, will take lndra and leave! - Where is lndra? - She doesn't live in this house! - Look for her at some other place! - Sister! Where did lndra go? For God's sake please tell me! Do you brothers think that l'm a servant? What do you think? l told you she doesn't live here! Very well. l'll search for her. lt won't be good if you bring that wretched woman into this house again! Why? Because you rule this house? Because you hate her? Because you've hoarded the wealth of our ancestors! lt's because she has made you a rebel and an ill-behaved man. lt's because this house was destroyed when she came here. lt's because she took my brothers away from me! lt's because she's wretched and wicked! Brother was right. She's not wicked but you are! Quiet you stupid man! l was quiet for 25 years but today l'll break your ego! You're the one that caused the destruction of this house. You're the one who tried to create a misunderstanding among brothers! You're the one who tortured an orphan girl! You're the one who was responsible for her father's death! Stop this nonsense! This pride, this arrogance, this egotism... this lofty head, these raised eyebrows will lower you one day! One day this house will haunt you and you'll roam like a crazy woman! You'll scream but no one will come to your aid! You'll suffer, but no one will pity you! Even when you die no one will come to mourn your death! As long as you're alive, l'll never set foot in this house! Raj Babu! Son! What an ill-fated woman you are. The house that you step in gets destroyed. Maybe there are storms and obstacles hidden in your life. What else do you want to see now? Hey mister, are you blind? - Forgive me brother. - Who? Raj! You don't need to worry. l'm still alive. Then why don't you embrace me? What are you looking at? Can you tell me where lndra is? Definitely not! Not until you embrace me. You're sitting all alone? You look better today. You're sighing. Maybe it's because of weakness, don't worry. Today l've brought such a doctor who will give you a new life... new happiness and love. Look here. Look here. Look at me. You won't look? Very well. Then the doctor himself will treat you. Doctor! The one who hurt you has come to ask for forgiveness. lf possible, please forgive me. lf you can't forgive... give me a punishment l'll remember all my life. l misunderstood you. For God's sake please forgive me! What's this? Wake up lndra! Ramesh! lndra! - Poison! - Poison? No! lndra can't have poison! l won't let you go away from me like this! lndra! Oh ill-fate! The desires of the heart couldn't be fulfilled! When the beloved came in the arms, so did the death. Raj's tale of love was over. Captions Provided By Cinephile Media
