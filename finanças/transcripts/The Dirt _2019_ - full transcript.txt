The 1980s. The worst fucking decade in human history. Preppies and keyboards, stupid haircuts, Jazzercise, and "Just Say No." It all fucking sucked! So, what do you do when you're born in the wrong time? You make it yours. And that's what we did to the Sunset Strip. We lived just up the street from the world famous Whisky a Go Go. Every weekend, kids from the Valley to the beach flooded the strip. And after the shows, they brought the party to our place. The cops kicked in our door so many times, we had to nail it shut. So everybody used the window. That's Tommy, our drummer. He makes a lot of bad choices. Check this out. You're gonna fucking freak! Speaking of bad choices, that's me, trying to prove how punk I am. Wow. Kayla? Hey, open the door. I know you're in there, Kayla. Come on, open the door. Is that really you? What the fuck do you think? That's our singer, Vince. He's not thinking about her, he's thinking, "Damn, I look good on that flyer." Hey. Hey, are you in the band? What band? And Mick Mars. He's an alien. - What were you doing in there? - Don't worry about it! We weren't a band. We were a gang. Holy shit, guys. Here it comes. A gang of fucking idiots. I guess if I'm gonna tell this story right, we should start with my happy childhood. So let's go back to before I was Nikki Sixx. Back to Frank Carlton Feranna Jr. That's me. My dad named me that after himself, right before he split. Which just left me with these three things. Up and down. I told you to brush up and down. Piece of shit! A revolving door of asshole stepfathers. Mom? Her. And music. ♪ Life is the same And it always will be... ♪ Turn it fucking down, Frankie. ♪ But I can't get no satisfaction ♪ ♪ All I want is easy... ♪ What's that? What's it look like? Where'd you get it? He probably stole it. Who the fuck is this guy? You think I don't know where you got all this shit?! So you noticed something I did, for once! Don't you talk to your mother like that, you little prick. Seriously? Who the fuck are you? Y'know what? I don't even care. Gonna be another you tomorrow, anyways. You wanna know who this is? He's another man in my life that you're gonna drive away... just like you did your fucking father! I was two years old, you bitch! He left you! Then how come he never tried to call you then, Frankie? Fuck you! Get the fuck outta here! Open the fucking door, Frankie! Fuck! Open that fucking door! God damn it! You little shit! Open the fucking door! Open the fucking... No! No, baby! No! No! What are you doing, baby?! And that's when I had my mom arrested. Of course I didn't hurt him. Frankie, will you please tell her what happened? - I gave birth to him. - Calm down... He is my son. I am calm. Frankie. Frank, you need to be honest about what happened. So, you're sticking to your story? She attacked you with a knife? No. Yep. Here's what's gonna happen, Frank. If we take her away, the state is gonna put you in a juvenile home until you're 18. Is that what you want? It's not my fault. I'm gonna give you a moment with your son, so... behave yourself. Come on, Frankie. Why are you doing this? I'm your mother! Are you fucking kidding me? I wanted a mom, but you only care about yourself and all of your stupid boyfriends. - Listen to me, Frankie. - No, you listen to me, okay? I'm not gonna see you. I'm not gonna answer to you. You're just gonna leave me alone... Deana. Frankie... Fine. Do what you want. Maybe I wanted her to care, but fuck it! I knew what I needed. It just took me a while to get there. I ended up on the streets of Hollywood. I was broke and starving, and I had no one to trust, so I made the mistake that many unwanted children make. I went chasing ghosts. Hello? Is this Frank Feranna? Who's this? Oh, hi, Mr. Feranna. This is your son... - Frank Jr. - Son? What are you talking about? - No, my... - I don't know who you are. No, my mother, she's Deana... Don't call here again. That was the last time I spoke to my father.

I mean, I love him, but sometimes, it's dysfunction junction over there, you know what I mean? See, I'm not like that. I'm just a hopeless fuckin' romantic, dude. All love, all the time. Yeah. Hey. - Hey. - So, who's on tonight? Those dudes. They've been selling out weekends at the Starwood, which is, like, huge. Pretty rad, man. - Good try, Pop. - Your mom made dinner. You coming down? - I'm already late to pick up my girl. - You got a new girlfriend? Yeah, but I think I'm in love this time for real. Aah! - Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome. Thank you, sweetie. God! Get a room, guys. Eat. You're too skinny. Yeah, chicken legs! You got 'em too. Oh, my God! Those are my pants. Mom! But... they look so much better on me! Later, creators! Mom! You should have told him to take them off! That rocked! It was way better than the last time! Did they fight each other on stage last time? That was the rad part! Two, please. Dude! Dude! Don't look. Wait. Okay, look now, but don't look like you're looking. Oh, fuck! You totally look like you're looking. That's Nikki fucking Sixx. - Who? - From the band we just saw. Should I go talk to him? I should talk to him, right? Yeah, I guess. Be right back. Hey, that was badass, dude. The show, not the nose, but... - Nose was pretty badass too. - The singer's an asshole. I know. I saw. Hey, fuck him, though. He deserved it. I got your poster on my bedroom wall. I can't believe I just said that. Take the fucking poster down, man. London's over. Anything else I can get you, boys? Could you get me a Jack and Coke? - And for you, hon? - Blueberry pancakes, please. My new band is gonna be something nobody's ever fuckin' seen before. That dude looks pretty cool. Do you carry those with you everywhere? Yeah. Where'd you learn to do that? High school marching band. Hey, but I rock too. - Thank you, Dottie. - Only for you. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What the fuck, dude? That's not what I showed you, man. Yeah, I know, but it's not like anything I've ever played before, man. That's the fucking point, man. Let's take a break. Well, I... Tommy, outside. - Tommy. - It's all good, man. Shit. I'm just not feeling it, man. I can't put my... He's a rhythm guy, man. We'll sound better when we find a lead. Holy shit. Check this dude out. Fuck. Whoa, dude. You got it? - Here for the audition? - Yep. - Well, I'm Tommy. - Mick Mars. - I'm the drummer. - Scrawny for a drummer. I used to be in Suite 19, so... Shitty band. - Hey, man, did you ever even see us play? - Suite 19? - Yeah. - Don't need to. Band with a shitty name, ten times out of ten, shitty band. Hey. - Hey, man. - What the fuck do you know? Been in a lot of bands with shitty names. - So you think you got it? - Let's just fucking play it. Whoa! Whoa! Hold up! Hey, you mind turning down a little bit, old timer? I can't hear myself. Jesus! Fucking hippie ain't gonna make it. So tell him. Listen to me. There's only room for one guitar player in this band, and that's me. So why don't you... pack up your toys and go home? Okay, I was here first, all right? Tommy, tell him. Nikki? Come on! Really?! You're gonna listen to this old dude over me? Then fuck you guys, man. And your shitty fucking band. - So how old are you, Mick? - Fuck you, you fucking teenager. What did I say? Yeah, to these kids, I was ancient. But they didn't know I was slowly becoming a fucking cripple too. Ankylosing spondylitis. It's a degenerative bone disease. It affects the joints and the ligaments that allow your spine to move. It's not a disease. It's a curse. It's like hot, quick-drying cement growing on the inside of your spine, making it so heavy, over the years, it starts to pull you to the ground. Yeah, you're goddamn right I'm old. Old enough to know better than to waste my time fucking around with a bunch of rug-monkeys. I'm paying child support and sleeping on park benches, so I need to know you're not pulling dick here 'cause I'm looking to go the distance. And if that's not you guys, let's not waste the fucking time. - I fucking love this weird little guy. - He's real, dude. Sorry. So... someone mind telling me who does the singing in this band? What we need is a dude that looks like David Lee Roth with a vibe like fucking Bowie, and I'm not about to settle for some regular looking, normal sounding asshole. So... we're looking for a skinny, blond fucker with moves. Wait.

Would you get a load of this blond-haired bitch? Tommy, damn! Come here, fucker! Good to see you, man. I'm in a band now, dude. With those guys right there. Dude, we watched you kill it today, man. You've gotta come jam with us. Come on, I got something going on. I can't. Oh, fuck that, man. Listen to this. My number's on the front. Call us. - All right, later. - See you soon. I think he's in. Okay. There was no way I was calling Tommy and his sketchy friends. I was in a band to get laid, not scare chicks away. What did you wanna be when you grew up? Not a fucking electrician... getting pissed on all day, I'll tell you that much. I think it's important for us to... like, say what we want in life, you know? It's like... if you say it enough, it just kinda happens. Like the universe is listening. - Come on, try it. - Oh... Say what you really want more than anything. - What I really want more than anything? - More than anything. A fucking blowjob. You think the universe can make that happen? You know, Tommy did let me sleep in his van when I ran away from home. Maybe I should call him tomorrow. Tommy, your boy's here. Who's the chick? Which one? Hey. - Hey, man. Nikki. - What's up, man? Vince. Come in. - Hey! What's up, Vince? - All right! - How are you? - Yeah, man. - This is Mick Mars. - What's up, man? - Listened to the tape? - Yeah. And we got you some lyrics.

Flames and shit. - Exactly. - Explosions. - Exactly. Look, it's a fucking war out there, and the only way we win is by showing these kids something they've never seen before. - So what do we call this thing? - Where is it? Here. You know, it's all about being, like, fucking larger than life. Xmass? Yeah. On a scale of one to ten, that gets a 1.9. It's a play on Christmas. You can use all the Christ imagery and shit. It'll piss people off and make people think, you know. It's got shock value. Yeah. I'm shocked by how much it blows. All right then, assholes. You give it a shot, but fucking make it big! Here.

I work for Elektra Records. - Nice to meet you, bro. - Hey, man. I'd love the opportunity to talk with you if you have a second. - Wanna sit down? - That's really cool. - Sit. Do it. - Thank you. - Scoot over. - Yes, absolutely. Listen, I've been seeing what you guys have been doing in LA, and I think, with my help, I think I could really do something for you... What is... Oh, my God! No? Not for you? - No, thanks. - You sure? No, thank you. Okay. Anyway, let's get back to, you know, what I was talking about. So, what do you guys say? Do you want a record deal? Uh... Is that a yes? I don't know if we can trust a dude who turns down a free blowjob. - Yeah. - Yeah. Elektra Records signed us to a five-album deal. Tommy, vacuum this mess up. Yes, sir. We got a fat cash advance, which meant better drugs and bigger parties. We were the kings. I mean, look at this place! Everybody wanted to party with us. Can I get a fucking line, man? Yeah, right, man. Get the fuck out of here. I mean, Diamond Dave from Van Halen, right there on our fucking couch! Can I get a line of that? Whoa! What the fuck, dude?! Chill out, asshole. It's cool. Cool? That is David Lee Roth. How about you show a little respect or get the fuck out? Make me, motherfucker. You fellas are gonna need a manager. Hey, Dave. What's everybody looking at? This didn't actually happen. Doc never came to this filthy shithole. We met him at the Santa Monica Civic Center after a show. He also brought his partner, Doug Thaler. Doug's a good guy, and it's kinda shitty he got cut from this movie, but I think this is as good a version as any. So... on with the goddamn show. Oh, good. You met Doc. He works with James Brown, Kiss, you name it. Fucking hate Kiss. Well, I make them a shitload of money, and I take care of everything they need, - which is what I'm gonna do for you. - Oh, yeah? And how are you gonna do that? Look, I know what I see up there. Anyone can start a band and crap out a song or two, but not many have the vision to go the distance. And you guys need someone to guide you through the fucking wilderness. And you're gonna be that someone? You're goddamn right I am. All right. This was our fucking moment. We'd conquered the Sunset Strip, and it was time for America to meet Mötley Crüe. We're gonna fucking die! Boys, on behalf of Elektra Records, I just wanna wish you good luck tonight. Where's Vince? Just saw him in the dressing room getting ready. This is your first big show, and there's 18,000 people out there tonight, so... please don't fuck this up. Thanks, Tom. Hey, let's go find Vince. Come on. Fuck all that. You guys just do what you do. Fuck! Jesus Christ. Have you seen my date? She's a brunette. She's wearing a leopard-skin bikini top. You've gotta find her 'cause if she misses the show, she'll kill me. Sure. Vince! Hey, Vince. Got a shitload of babes waiting out here for you, bud. Vince! Coming! Oh! All right. Cool, man. Just hurry up. Vinnie, come on, man. Let's go! Jesus fucking Christ. You do realize we just signed a record deal with his company and that fucking his girlfriend could seriously fuck that up? Only if he finds out, man. I found out many years later, and it hurt really bad. Bottom line is, don't ever leave your girlfriend alone with Mötley Crüe, ever! Because they'll fuck her! Seriously, we're gonna die. - I'm okay. - Right, listen up. Come on, gather round, guys. Look where we are. We've got an old man, a kid drummer, a cover band singer and a fucking runaway. No one would have thought we'd make it here, so fuck them. Win it all or lose it all, we're Mötley fuckin' Crüe. So let's destroy these motherfuckers! - Yeah. - Come on!

Quit it. Give me the pen, all right? I don't even know why you told them. It's not like she has anything to do with us getting married. Baby, it's sweet, all right? It's tradition. Which tradition?

You've got a gun to your head. Fuck one or die. Which one is it gonna be? No, you know what? I'm having trouble accepting this premise. Under what circumstances would I find myself in such a situation? - It's a mystery, you cockney fuck. - It's a mystery. You know, some random fucker's trapped the three of you in a room, and he's demanding you fuck one of them. What does this mysterious person benefit from my sexual humiliation? I don't know, man, but you're definitely gonna die if you don't fucking pick. In that case, I think I'd have to go with the Lauper. At least she's got the proper plumbing. Hey, no, but Georgie boy, he's probably more experienced in the handling of penis. So... What the fuck? Jesus. Hey. That was a fucking close one, man. But... where are we? It's Christmas. Look at all the lights. What the fuck are you talking about, man? Oh, yeah. Look at the lights, man. What do you want for Christmas, Raz? Wake up, man. Raz, wake up. Hey. Wake up, man. My buddy fell asleep. Hey. Wake up, man. Help! Razzle! Come on, man, wake up! Fuck. Razzle was dead. The people in the other car were both critically injured. Vince was arrested for drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail. But only served 19 on the condition that he stay sober. The Mötley Crüe front man paid 2.5 million in restitution, and some wonder if the consequences are harsh enough for the singer whose actions resulted in tragedy. Vince was my band mate, my best friend, my brother. And I didn't call. I didn't visit. I didn't support him in any way whatsoever. Why wasn't I there for him? It was simple. I'd fallen head over heels in love. And she was the sweetest thing I'd ever known. She made me feel all the warmth and happiness I never knew as a child. Her name was heroin. Hey, what's taking so long? Vince got out of jail, like, three months ago. They should be on tour by now. Are you out of your fucking mind? Look at 'em. They're a fucking mess. No shit. Look, man, my boss is killing me. We need to get them to finish that record and get back on the road. Yeah. I'll get 'em on tour, but you guys, you think you own them because you own their music, right? Well, then, it's on you and your fucking label if one of those idiots comes back in a body bag. Just... Just... get them back on the road. All right? Yo. - What's up, dude? - Hey, man. Hey. I got, um, the lyrics. I made a couple of adjustments, but... I think you may like 'em. "Home Sweet Home"? It's been too long, buddy. Here. Have a bump with me. I just got out of fucking jail. You're an asshole. Wanna show him the melody? - What the fuck was that? - That was smack. You guys slip me smack, and I'm the fucking problem? Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I'm a monster. I killed Razzle, yeah. Could have happened to any one of you! Nice job, Nikki. The craziest thing about all this... is that I thought it was Vince who was fucking up the band. Frankie... this is your mom. Look, I know that you're busy, yeah, being a big star and all. I'd just really like to talk to you sometime. Call me back. Okay? You must have gotten the selfish gene from your father, 'cause this is very selfish, what you're doing. It's just... I just miss you... Frankie. Talk to me. Please? Damn it, Frankie. Okay, do I have to let you go? Baby! Come here. - You have a little... - No, leave it. It'll remind me of you. Okay. Just take it off before dinner with Daddy tonight, okay? Yeah. Come here. - Bye, baby. - Bye. Yeah! Is that one gonna be a problem? What? She's great. - You're lucky she's hot. - I know. She's super hot, right? I think I'm in love, Mick. Hey, man. Oh, Skylar, is it time to go already? Say bye to Daddy. We're going to be late. Come on. Mommy! - Come on, we're leaving. - Mommy! - Mommy! - She wants me. Stop. I know, baby. Bye, Vince. - I know, baby. - Bye, Sharise. It's okay, baby. Is this bring your fucking girlfriend to work day? Wish I had a girlfriend. I know, Mick. I know. Well, at least the album's great. - The album blows, Doc. - What are you talking about? "Smokin' in the Boys Room" is gonna be huge. Come on! "Home Sweet Home." Everyone knows that's a hit. Two decent songs. The rest is pure shit. Believe me, I know. I'm gonna be the only one sober up there every night trying to sell it. Well, I believe in you guys. Look. You know Nikki changed the title to Theatre of Pain last night, right? Of course he did. Go get some rest, buddy. Fuck me. Theatre of Pain. - Are we over Cambodia yet? - No, dude. Colombia? I've gotta ask you something, man. And I need a serious answer. Go for it. Heather and me. We're making it official, and I officially wanna make you my best man. You're my brother, dude. Okay, she's gonna be my wife, and I can't imagine being up there without you, bro. Will you do it? Do what? Be my best man. Come on! - Of course I'll do it. - Thank you. Are we gonna rock Denver tonight or what, T-bone? It's Kansas City, man, but, yeah, we're gonna rock. Of course, he doesn't know where we're going! I mean, dude... how the fuck can you keep track? You wanna know what life on the road's really like? For me, every day went something like this... Five p.m. Phone rings. Wake up. Aw, fuck! Remember nothing. Seven-thirty p.m. - Hang out backstage. - There he is. Drink. Come back to life. - Hey, Tom! - Hey. What up, man? Argh!

God, I'm so weak. One a.m. The stewardess serves up some drugs and drinks. Thank you. For Vince, sleeping pills. For Mick, vodka. For Nikki and me, zombie dust, which keeps the body awake and shuts the brain off, man. Four a.m. Arrive in new city, go straight to the nearest strip club. Drink, snort and fuck everything in sight. Oh! I'm so sorry. Hey, Vinnie! - Hey, I need to borrow... - Hey. No. Hey, I'm good for it, man. - I'll give it back. - Come on, man! And, hey, be sure to tip big. Don't be fucking stingy. Goddamn, I love strippers. So sorry. I am so sorry. Six a.m. Back at the hotel. Completely shit-faced. Hey, your food is ready! Fuck. Ah, this is a nice place. Time to redecorate. Yeah, move the TV over here. - What is wrong with you? - Don't fucking come in here. - Stop it! - Fuck you, Doc. Next thing you know, get handcuffed to the bed by Doc. Stupid fuck... Goodnight. Five p.m. Phone rings. Wake up. Remember nothing. Oh, God! - Fuck. - Answer the door, Sixx. All right. Fuck you, Sixx. Answer the door. Clean yourself up. You've got a visitor. Your mother called and asked to come to a show. So, I thought with it being the holidays and all... Merry Christmas, Frank. That's not my name. My baby. Oh, that song. The one about looks that kill. It's about me, isn't it, Frankie? - Frankie? - That's not my fucking name! Nikki. Nikki! Wait up a minute, will ya? Who the fuck do you think you are? I thought it would help. I fucking trusted you, but you are not my fucking father and you are not my fucking friend. You are just another leech with your hands in my pockets who wouldn't be standing there now unless you were getting something out of it, so just fuck off, Doc.

Come on! You fucking kidding me? Hey, Nikki. Wake up, asshole. What the fuck, dude? Jesus! I'm good. It's all good. You're most definitely not all good, man. But, whatever, just clean... Hey! Get your shit together. I don't want Heather to be embarrassed, okay? I'm embarrassing? Cool. Let's go marry your fancy ass TV chick in this fancy ass hotel. Hey, are you gonna do this on the happiest day of my life, asshole? The happiest day of your life? Nah, the happiest day of your life was when I let you join my band. Shall I get someone else to stand up there with me or what? Don't look at me, man. I'll do it, Drummer. I've already got the fucking rings. Let's just go. Shit! Come on, guys. Picture. Big smiles. Nikki, come on, man. Nikki was so fucked up that day. I couldn't believe he was shooting up at my wedding. At the time, I thought it was just that he couldn't stand to see someone else be happy. So I took it personally, but I didn't know that the partying had turned into something else for him. If you've got a big hole in your heart, then I guess you need to fill it with something, and he was filling it with $1,000 a day in heroin. He was just in a dark fucking place. And the sad thing is, I think he liked it there. Did I miss the party? You look like a man in need of some sweet... sweet Persian. How is that Persian? Is there even still a Persia? There has to be. It's where all the cats come from. Oh, yeah. What cats? Persian. The cross-eyed ones, like in Lady and the Tramp. - Remember those evil fuckers? - They're Siamese cats. You don't fuckin' know shit about Walt Disney. I know he's a perv, man. He used to like to lay beneath glass tables and have hookers take a shit right on the glass. What are you talking about? That never happened. How do you know? Because I'm a fucking perv, and I've never even thought about anything as fucked up as that. You want some or not? Yeah, but you... You do it. Goddamn. Squeezing. Bibbety, bobbety, boo... Nikki? Hey. Nikki. Hey. You okay? - What the fuck did you give him? - Fuck, dude. - Nikki? - Oh, shit! Guys! Somebody call an ambulance! Wake up! Fuck! Wake the fuck up! Party's over. It's a sad night for rock and roll. We've just received unconfirmed reports that Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx has died in Hollywood this evening of an apparent drug overdose. What the fuck? We'll continue to bring you details on this developing story. - What the fuck? - Daddy, are you okay? Yeah, baby, I'm fine. Yeah. I love you. I love you too. Let's get you back to bed. Come on. I can't bring him back, man. Fuck. Fuck! All right. Time of death... Nah. This is Nikki fucking Sixx, man. He's not about to die in my ambulance. Come on. - Come on. Fuck! - I've got nothing. Nah-ah. Ow! Yo! All right! I'd finally hit rock bottom. I'm done with drugs, I'm done with being unhappy, and I'm done with letting everyone down. Hey, it's Nikki. I'm not home... ♪ It doesn't mean I didn't try ♪ ...'cause I'm dead. ♪ I just never know why ♪ ♪ Feel so cold and all alone ♪ ♪ Baby, you're not at home ♪ I couldn't face that I was one of the luckiest guys on the planet.

So I did the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I reached out and asked for help. I called the band, and they all agreed to get clean with me. Mötley Crüe was going to rehab. You wanna know what rehab was really like? Feelings and crying and apologies. This is my second time. Trust me, it's a drag. You don't wanna see any of that shit. But at least it got us in the studio. ♪ What have we got here? ♪ ♪ Come on, girls! ♪ Yeah! So rad, dude. So fucking rad.

I'm just tired of singing the same thing ten times in a row when it was fucking fine the first time. Vince, this album is gonna be great, so let's just hang in there, buddy.

Here's to your sober band. Get me that itinerary, bass player. Whoo! Blah de blah, fucking blah. I'm telling you, guys, everything is fucking upside down and flip-flopping. And while we're waiting for our lead singer to get his head out of his ass, we're getting left in the dust, man. I'm just saying, bands replace their front men and it still works. Van Halen... I know Van Halen fucking did it 'cause you say that every single time Vince misses a fucking rehearsal. Well? Mick? Shut it. Where is this asshole? Every second that goes by, I feel another bone rotting from this fucking disease. Call the prick again. The ultimate party band, Van Halen, right? To all of a sudden being not only accepted, but, you know, also kind of acknowledged. Maybe if we save that fill until the second chorus when we come in with the... Someone wanna tell me what the fuck's going on here? Let's save us all some time, especially yours, Vince, as it's clearly more fucking valuable than ours! You'd better tell me what the fuck's going on. We're down here, and we're working, and we wanna be here, but we are tired of forcing you to be here with us. Maybe I'd come in more if I liked the material. Maybe you'd like the material if you were in the studio making it with us instead of staring at your fucking watch! Yeah, I'm staring at my watch because this album is fucking stupid! You know what, fuck all y'all. You know, I am done. Fuck this. I quit. Good, 'cause you're fucking fired! I quit already, dick. It might look like a new Mötley Crüe, but they promise it's the same ol' situation. In their first interview with new singer John Corabi, the Crüe gives us a glimpse inside all the sex, drugs and rock and roll. So what can we expect in this new era without Vince Neil? Well, we had four ingredients, and we took one fourth out and we put a stronger fourth in. It's just better. Better, faster, louder. Yeah, it's about now. It's not about then, you know. You can't live in the past. Man, they suck without you. Yep. Vince... come here. What the hell is going on? - At first... - What? ...I thought it was a stomach ache and... You know how she had the flu? I thought she had the flu again and... They thought it was appendicitis, and then they told me that... she has a tumor in her stomach. And she... She... - She has cancer. - Oh, my God. I don't like it here, Daddy. Make it go away. I know, sweetheart. You're just gonna be here just a little while longer, okay? But why? Well, you see, sweetheart, you have something growing in your tummy. Like when Mommy had me growing in her tummy? No, honey. It's more like... It's more like a flower. You have a flower growing in your tummy, but it's a type of flower that's not supposed to be in there. And so the doctors, they're gonna make you sleep just a little bit while they do an operation. After the doctor takes the flower out, then I can go home? Yeah. Yeah. Then you can go home. You got something to say? Well, I just didn't think it would end this way, with some other dude singing your songs. You mean Elektra's fucking songs? You're never gonna live up to this deal. You know that, right? Then how about you give us back the rights to our music and we'll call it even? What are you even asking? You want me to give you back your music instead of the money we owe you? The Beatles don't even own the rights to their own fucking music. Well, The Beatles should own the rights to their own fucking music. And so should Mötley Crüe. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. Daddy's right here, baby. Daddy, don't let them cut me again. I'm not gonna let them cut you, okay? We're gonna go home soon. Real soon. - Baby, what the fuck? - I want you out! Have a great life with your porno slut, you asshole! Baby, I... - Don't. - Baby! Tommy, you fucking idiot! Fuck! Fuck! Hey. I can't believe you wanted to meet here. Seemed appropriate. I mean, you guys got your dicks sucked at this table, for Christ's sake. Not anymore, Tom. - Yeah, well... - Not anymore. The label's fed up with you. They're dropping you. You convinced them to give you back the rights to your music, so you own it all now. - It's what you wanted, right? - Yep. Are you happy? Still... we had a pretty good ride, though, right? Yeah, we had a good ride. I liked it better with Vince, though. Yeah. You're really Frank Feranna? This is way too trippy. You're Nikki Sixx. I grew up on Mötley Crüe. I mean, I got laid for the first time to "Home Sweet Home." You guys still play? Yeah, man. Glad you dig the band. So this is him. Yep, that's my dad. Well, our dad. Crazy! Nikki Sixx and I have the same dad. He had a heart attack on Christmas Day. He was an asshole, man. You're lucky you never knew him. I spent my whole life chasing ghosts, looking for something I could never find. And here it was right in front of me the whole time... and up on stage with me every night. Hey, man. What I did at your wedding... I didn't... know... how to do that. How to be there. What's up, Nikki? I was really fucking selfish and I shit on something that was important to you, and I am really sorry. I know you pretty well, Sixx, so... I kinda get it. And it's okay. But can you say that last part one more time for me? Don't fucking push it, T-bone. Come in, man. I heard you and Heather broke up. Yeah. I think she's gonna end up being the one that got away. I'm sorry, man. Knew I'd get you to say it again! Fuck you. All right. We're going on a mission. Filthy bastards. How's that new hip, dude? Feel like The Terminator now or some shit? Touch the chair and I'll terminate you, Drummer. Ready for this, Mick? Thank you. Stop looking at me like that. Let's go get our fucking singer back already. Aye-aye, captain. Goddammit. Hey, Vince. Hey, man. Just wanna talk, Vinnie. That's it. Come on, Vinnie. Let's talk. I was scared. After what happened with Razzle, I was scared that I was losing the only thing that ever mattered to me. - Yeah, your band. - No. No. This. This. Look, we went to war together. Shit changes, people change, but I don't fucking care if Mötley Crüe never plays another note. All I want is my fucking brother back. Because this is the only family that I've ever known. Fuck. We love you, Vin. Okay, fuck, I love you. And I am sorry about Skylar, man. Fuck. It's against the laws, man. It's against the fucking rules of the universe. Hey. Hey. We got you, brother.
