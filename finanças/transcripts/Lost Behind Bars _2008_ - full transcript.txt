[music] [music] Lauren: Hillsdale here we come. Mark: Okay, so who's next up? Lauren: Name's Kevin Reese. This one sounds like a real monster - murdered a husband, wife and two children in broad daylight. [music] It says here he's scheduled to be executed in less than a month. [music] [music] Hey, when you get set up, I want to re-cut the front end of this Huntsville footage. I think we need to pick up the pace a little bit. Whatever you say. I'm just glad to be out of Texas. Do you think Oregon's going to be any different? I doubt it. Well, we'll find out. [door clicks open] [music] Help you? Yes, I'm Lauren Wilde. I have two rooms for the next two weeks. You're that documentary film lady. That's me. Doing a movie about Kevin Reese. No, it's not about Kevin Reese. It's about Death Row inmates and their last month of life. Kevin's story is just one of many we're telling across the country. Do us all a favor, film lady. What's that? Check out early. Hey, would you like to do an interview? Maureen: You're wrong, lady. You've got your movie backwards. It's not what the execution does to the Community. It's what the murder does to it. It hurts. Burt: Yeah, it hurts. Noel Watson was a a friend of most everybody here. His kids were babies. Do you hear me? Babies. That Kevin Reese is a damn animal... a drug addict and a bum. He's been a loser all his life. He killed Amanda, Noel and those children in cold blood. And he's going to pay for it. You digging around can't change that. This town was tore up good when Reese killed that poor family. We've all been waiting for a long time for his execution. His time is up. Is there anyone here who feels that Mr. Reese's death may not provide the closure that this town is looking for? That since his execution won't bring back the Watson family, all that will have happened is there will have been another life lost? No one in the Police Department has an opinion about what the effect of Kevin Reese's execution is going to be on your community? [exasperated sigh] Okay. There are 30 convicts on Death Row in the state of Oregon, yet only two have been executed since 1976. Kevin Reese is going to be number three. It was a Hillsdale family that he murdered. It was a Hillsdale police officer who arrested him, a Hillsdale jury that found him guilty, and it will be in a Hillsdale prison where he will be injected and killed. Is it really possible that not one person in this room has any thoughts on the subject? Yeah, I got a thought. Great. Your name? Detective Tom Redler. And you're familiar with the case? I was here. So what are you thinking? I'm thinking that nobody here gives a damn about your movie. So why don't you turn your camera off and go back from where you came from. We got work to do. Another officer: Here, here. All right. [music] The camera's been rolling for 15 minutes and you've said exactly nothing. Is that really what you want us to think? That you have no thoughts on your own execution? You have no defense to offer? No want to ask? You have no anger, no confusion, no sadness, no regrets, no nothing? Whew... Mr. Reese, you are about to die for the murders of the entire Watson family, Noel Watson, his wife Amanda, and their two young children. The transcripts say that you've admitted having an affair with Amanda Watson. From what I've read, you were at home, you were drinking, you were using drugs at the time. What was you intention when you got into your truck that day? If you could help me to understand what was going through your mind as you drove out to the Watson house. [sound of approaching truck] Perhaps if we knew the series of events that led up to this desperate act... Is there something that would help us to understand? Mr. Reese? Mr. Reese... [music] There are hundreds and hundreds of convicts on Death Row right now and the clock is ticking down for them too. Only, no one's listening. Their voices will never be heard. Yours will. Mr. Reese, I am looking right at you, and I know [music] Let's go. Did you love her? [music] Yeah. Did she love you? Yeah, she did. I know she did. She was married. It was nothing. Just a piece of paper and a ring, that's all. He was 60. She was 25. He was rich and wanted kids. He never loved her. Just gave her cars, clothes, money, nothing else. She stayed for the kids. She loved them. Did you know the girls? No. They looked like her. They were very young, eight and six. I drew them... one time at the house. Watson was out of town. Amanda got them dressed up. They liked to laugh. It was hard to keep them still. Did you know you were going to shoot them that night? I was wired... drinking and pills and... and I know I was there. I just can't remember doing it. But I can't deny it. [prison buzzer] [music] Lauren: Well, he loved her. She loved him. Mark: They broke up, he lost his mind, crime of passion. Happens every day. So he's drunk and stoned. He's on pills and who knows what else. He drives over to her house, pulls out a gun, and shoots everyone in sight? He says he can't deny it. Yeah, that's what's bugging me. What? Well, there a big difference between "I can't deny it" and "I did it." A big difference. Not that [footsteps] Redler: Keys. Quinn: You ever going to let me drive? How long's it been? What? Since we've been partners? Six months, does it matter? No. No, it doesn't matter? No, you're not listening. No, I'm never going to get to drive? No, all of the above. Lauren: Detective Redler! Redler: Oh, god! [slam] I haven't got time for you right now, Wilde. Well, you're going to have to make time. You better get out of my face, lady, or I'm going to make things very unpleasant for you. Lauren: I'm sure you would if it were up to you... Hey! But it's not up to you. I have a letter here from the Governor granting me full cooperation from all law enforcement officials in the state. That includes a police liaison while I'm shooting in Hillsdale. You, Detective Redler, are my police liaison. You can thank your Captain. Lauren Wilde. Charlie Quinn. What do you want from me? The Kevin Reese case files. I'd like to take a look at them. Why? Well, we're here shooting the Kevin Reese case, so the files help me fill in the holes, and makes the film more factual and substantial. Anything else? Were you the officer of record? No. But you know the story? Redler: Everyone knows the story. Not everyone. Not yet. I'm rolling. Good. Now? Lauren: Please, if you can. It's just going to take a couple of minutes, Detective. Could you tell me about Kevin Reese, about the murders. If the story ends with his execution, then it begins with him, as well. It doesn't just start with Reese, it starts with Reese and Mrs. Watson. Lauren: Amanda Watson. Yeah, she overheated a car on Route 23, and pulled into a garage he was working at... [car engine] [music] Kevin! Yeah? Amanda: Hi, thanks [music] Hi. Hi. Is that your car? Yeah. It's nice. Thanks. Are you going to fix it for me? Yeah, I could fix that. Amanda. Kevin. Together: Nice to meet... [laughs] Why don't you go on inside. Okay. Make yourself at home. [music] Amanda: So... Y North Chase, it's a trailer park down the road. You? I live in Pine Valley. Big houses, lots of land, no neighbors. It sounds quiet. Uh, no... I have two kids. You don't look like you have two kids. Amanda: Did you do these? Yeah. [music] They're good. Thanks. I like art. That's just a couple of sketches. Oh, you have more? Yeah, I got lots more. That's my real passion. I'd love to see them. You'd have to come down to the trailer. Okay. [music] [honk, honk, honk...] That's me. Goodbye. Girls: Mommy! Hi! Girls: Hi, Mommy! [music] Amanda: Back in the car. Back in the car. [music] [rattle of tools] Gabler: Oh, you went to the prison? Yeah. Death Row? That's right. One month to live. Must be rough. I would think so. He say you're making it worse? He didn't say much of anything. He never did. Kept to himself. Never hurt nobody. That's not what they're saying in town. They got it wrong. What they said about him after the murders, that wasn't Kevin. So he's not a drug addicted, alcoholic, lowlife, murdering loser? He had issues with booze and pills, but he was a tortured artist. Don't all you tortured artists have issues? Would you say that it was a character assassination? I think they needed to believe he was the kind of guy who would shoot little girls in the back so they wouldn't feel bad about giving him the needle. Was he that kind of guy? Not in a million years. I don't care how loaded he was, he loved her and them kids. Hey! What do you wanna go and stir all this up for again? It won't do no good. Th They're gonna kill him no matter what you do. But you don't You're not listening, lady. He ain't no murderer, okay? [bell dings for service] Do you think his execution will change the point... Look. Do you mind getting the hell out of here? I got customers. Voice outside: Anybody work here? Gabler: Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. [music] Lauren: It's just bothering me, that's all I'm saying. But that's how it always starts with you. How what always starts? Need I mention the clinic? Oh, come on. That was completely different. Not different. We were doing a movie about abortion rights, a typical Lauren Wilde controversial film about a nationally charged hot-button topic. You love that. Yes I do. Not the point. The clinic burns down a week before we arrive and instead of trying to get things together... No, no. Not 'instead of'. Okay, while we continue to make the film, you decide you just had to investigate the fire. Yeah, because it wasn't an accident. It was arson. As if the local police invited you to help them figure that out, which of course, they didn't. No, they didn't. I did. You know, if I wanted my little brother around to bust my chops, I would've brought him. You don't have a brother. Oh, yeah, that's right, I don't. I have you instead. [music] Hi, can I get another round? I'm just going to... [footsteps] Could I ask you a question? Sure. Are you Lauren Wilde? Are you going to run me out of town if I say yes? I'm going to buy you a beer. I am Lauren Wilde. I'm Gayle Lerner. I thought it was you. I'm a big fan of your films. Oh wow, my one and only Hillsdale fan. It's nice to meet you, Gayle. Oh, and I heard you were making a movie about Kevin Reese. Well, it's about executions, about capital punishment, the emotional consequences, the political correctness, incorrectness, the short and long term effects on the community. Kevin Reese is just one of the Death Row inmates in the film. Have people here given you a hard time? Both sides. Yeah, see, that's the trouble with this town. Nobody trusts anybody else, especially if you're not local. I can't stand it sometimes. A lot of times. I take it you're not local? No, New York, Albany. Oh, me too, Binghamton. Oh, hello. What are you doing here? I'm Hillsdale County's Chief Forensic Scientist. Five years ago I was in Albany minding my own business, they made me an offer, and in a moment of madness I accepted. I'm kidding, I think. It's just a hard place to live if you're not from here. It's not the East coast. Bagels and p So, five years... You must know all about the Kevin Reese case. Yeah, I guess I know my little part. But what you're looking for - the emotional consequences of his execution? No, I'm no help. I don't have a clue what anybody around here is thinking. If you're looking for deeper meaning, you're going to have to dig. Well, that's what I do best. Yeah, that's why I'm a fan. Um... here's my card. Give me a call if you get stuck. Every now and then there's a couple strings I can pull. That's great. Thank you very much, Gayle. Cheers,: Cheers. [footsteps] Lauren: Detective. Redler: Give me a break, Wilde. Lauren: Look, you are going to cooperate. Yeah, so you keep reminding me. Well, you could start by giving me the Kevin Reese case files. It's going to be difficult. Oh, yeah? And why is that? Because they're gone. Can't find them. [music] Lauren: Redler! Hey! Case files don't just disappear! For heaven's sake! Especially not on a first degree murder when the execution's less than a month away, and an award winning filmmaker with the permission of your Governor and the approval of your Captain is asking to see them. Looks like they do. You have no right to do this. The death penalty is an important issue. This is an important film. Self-important. Look, I am on a deadline and the clock is running. Me too. Find the files, Detective, or I'll ask your Governor if he knows where they are. Cut it. [music] [music] Lauren: Patty, you were Kevin Reese's roommate. So you're clean now? 14 months. It isn't easy. No. I did a film on drug addiction. I know it's hard. You knew Kevin Reese better than anybody, didn't you? Better than anyone, but Amanda. I mean we were roommates for two years. He helped me get clean. We got clean together. And did you both live here? I had the back room. He took the couch. Were you involved? No. Just friends. He was like a brother to me. I mean is, is like a brother, not was... It's okay. Patty, we understand. You work downtown, so I imagine you have a pretty good idea of what Kevin's execution means to Hillsdale. Patty? He never hurt anybody. People talk about him like he's some kind of monster. It's a joke. It's a bad joke. It's like they can't wait to kill him off. Like somehow if they do it, it isn't murder. It's crap. Murder's murder. Look at these... [music] [music] Kevin did these. Amanda's children. Lauren: They're beautiful. You can see his heart, right? His heart and his soul. He couldn't talk about his feelings, but he c but he could draw them. Lauren: Amanda? Yeah. She was seeing someone else besides Kevin. Did you know that? At the same time? Around the same time, yeah. Who? He didn't know who. I mean, he knew there was someone else. But he didn't talk to her about it. He said he didn't want to screw up what he had. He knew Amanda loved him, and he didn't want to lose that, no matter what. Did you testify about this at Kevin's trial? No. Why not? His lawyer said it wasn't important. Why not? You have to ask his lawyer. [music] Lauren: Thanks. Take care. [footsteps] Nice lady. I feel bad for her. Mark: She's had a rough road. Yeah. Jerry McAffrey. What? Jerry McAffrey, Reese's lawyer. Let's go say hello. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Uh... Lauren, just do me a favor and try to remember something while we're there, okay? What? The case is closed. The case is closed. Okay? [footsteps] Lauren: Here's our guy. Mr. McAffrey! Hello... Lauren Wilde. This is Mark Evans. Oh... The infamous filmmaker. I was hoping you'd come see me. Let me guess, you're looking for a leading man. I've got to be in court in ten minutes. Let's go for a walk. Sure. Actually, I wanted to ask a few questions. Do I need a lawyer? Fire away. I was wondering if you knew that Amanda Watson was seeing someone else while she was having the affair with Kevin Reese? Who told you that? Patty Sutton. Oh, yes. Miss Sutton. Yet you never called her to testify on Kevin's behalf. Of course not. I was trying to save Mr. Reese's life. Miss Sutton is a junkie with a criminal record. If I made a list of the least credible witnesses in courtroom history, she would be comfortably at the top. If I'd called her, that is. Since I didn't, she remains simply a junkie with a criminal record. Besides it's extremely unlikely that Mrs. Watson was having simultaneous affairs. Why is that? She and Mr. Reese were burning the candle at both ends. [music] Hi. Hi. [music] Kevin: Look, we can't. He's going to be here in ten minutes... Amanda: Oh we have to... We have to? Yeah. [music] It's a matter of life and death. Kevin: It sounds serious. Amanda: Oh, it is serious. [music] See you tonight, right? Yeah, I just couldn't wait. [music] Will you draw me? What, right now? No, not now. Later Tonight. After we make love. Yes. You're going to be a famous artist. You think so? Oh, I know so. You're going to draw me and someone's going to discover you and you'll be a famous artist. [music] Sheesh. If this was the first time, I'd be pretty pissed off. Sad to say, I'm used to it. Look, do you mind if I eat lunch at my desk? I got paperwork. Kevin: No, go right ahead. [music] Gabler: If you're done, check the brakes on that Ford. And next time close the blinds. People can see you from the street. [music] Gayle: Of course I knew the Watsons. I mean everyone knew Noel, the husband. He was the City Manager. I thought he was an accountant. Yeah he was. He was very successful. As he got older, his friends pushed him into politics. They didn't have to push him hard, he liked it. Was he a nice guy? Yeah, absolutely. [footsteps] Um... are you moving somewhere? Across town. They passed a bond and they're building a new facility. It's almost done. They let me design what I wanted. Wow, where can I get people like that? The price is, you have to live here. Oh, pretty steep. You You're telling me. You still live in Binghamton? No, the City now. Upper West Side. But I'm hardly ever there. I'm going to say that about Hillsdale very soon. I'm not there. Where are you going to be? Costa Rica. I'm not retiring yet, but soon. It's time to get out of the rat race. Yeah, I'd like to sign up for that plan. So, what's up? Um... you said you might be able to pull some strings. Yeah. Detective Redler told me that the Kevin Reese case files are missing. What do you mean missing? Gone. Unavailable. Lost. Well, that's not possible. And yet...? Oh, I'll see what I can do. [footsteps] Quinn: Ms. Wilde! Detective Quinn. What can I do for you? Just making sure you're okay. Your boyfriend said you were at meetings. He's my cameraman, Detective, not my boyfriend. I'll make a note. He said you were speaking to McAffrey and Lerner. That's true. Either of them have the case files? No. It doesn't sit right with me. It doesn't sit right with me either. I heard rumors. At the time, I mean. But, I can't prove them. Rumors about...? Redler. What about him? Look, somebody told somebody told somebody t they used to see them together at a motel out on Route 9. But like I said, they were rumors. Used to see who? Redler and Amanda Watson. They were having an affair at the same time she was with Kevin Reese. [music] [background restaurant sounds] Lauren: Go ahead. [footsteps] I left you three messages. Didn't get them. Do you have the case files? No. Look, I'm busy. Do you mind? I don't believe you. Believe what you want. I believe you were ha You still busy? I went out to Route 9. The motel where you and Amanda used to go. They recognized her picture. So what? It was all over the news. It doesn't mean anything. Maybe they'd recognize your picture. I'd think long and hard before taking me on, Wilde. Understand? Are you threatening me, Detective? Just sharing my thoughts. As long as we're sharing... Redler: No. Look, I don't give a damn about your movie, or your letters from the Governor, or anything else you've got to say. Kevin Reese murdered the Watson family and he's going to pay for it big time. Until then, you stay out of my face. And you! Mark: Ooof! Are you all right? Yeah. Lauren: It doesn't add up. That's what's wrong. Mark: Changing the subject, I shot this indie feature last spring about an Opera Diva? Patty and Quinn say that Amanda was seeing someone besides Kevin... Took the actress three hours to get ready for camera... Redler and McAffrey say she wasn't... This guy's worse. You're not listening to me. We have conflicting stories. Conflicting stories are good drama, Lauren. You're not supposed to be adding anything up. You're the one who's not listening. Yes I am. Indie feature. Opera Diva. This guy's worse. It's not my first time on camera, as you might imagine. Lauren: No. That's generally the impression I get when someone has their own make-up artist on staff. Good one. Are we rolling? Yeah. Okay. [Lauren rustles her paper] I'm Dan Spencer, Hillsdale County District Attorney. I successfully prosecuted Kevin Reese for the murders of Noel and Amanda Watson and their two children. Mr. Reese is currently on Death Row and is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in, what is it? 26 days, I believe. If I can shed any light as to the emotional consequences of Mr. Reese's execution on our community, as DA, I'm happy to offer my opinion. You were one of Noel Watson's closest friends, is that right? Noel was my accountant for 40 years. We worked together on City Council and again when he became City Manager. Noel's murder was a tremendous loss to this community and to me personally. We were very close friends. And he was quite a bit older than Mrs. Watson. Yes, he was. But his children were bright and happy. And anyone who knew them as a couple would tell you that they were friends in spite of everything that had happened. It was my understanding that they had left it all behind them. Mrs. Watson's affair? Yes. Were you aware of the possibility that Amanda Watson may have been having simultaneous affairs around the time of the murders? Spencer: Uh... uh... Okay, you can cut. Not 'possibility', Ms. Wilde. Unsubstantiated rumor. You were friends for 40 years. Did you ever discuss it? How is this relevant to the subject of your documentary? So your answer would be no comment. My answer is that Noel didn't know anything about a second affair. He knew about Mr. Reese. He knew all about Mr. Reese... [music] [music] Noel: Amanda! Amanda! [music] You followed me [music] I am leaving you. No you're not. Because you have no right... You talk to me about rights? I love him, Noel. You're an embarrassment, Amanda. Then let me go. Let me have a life. Let me take the girls and... No! Not like that, no! You don't own me. I'll throw you out of the house so fast it'll make your head spin. No money. No cars. No clothes. And no kids. You can't take the girls. Yes I can, Amanda. And I will. I'll get full and final custody and you'll get nothing. Which is what you were when I met you, and what you still are. You had affairs, too. I know you did. Get in the car and go home, Amanda. Go on! Kevin: Hey! [footsteps] Don't touch her. Noel: I said go! [car engine starts] Listen carefully. I'm going to make this as simple as I can. If you come near her one more time - just once more you understand me? I will use all the considerable means at my disposal to ruin the rest of your miserable life and the lives of all your pathetic circle of friends. Have I made myself clear? Good. [music] [Lauren on computer]: "Well, you're going to have t have to make time." Gayle: You do not want to mess with Tom Redler. [Tom on computer]: "...get out of my face, lady, or I'm going to make things very unpleasant for you." Mark: I keep trying to tell her. Gayle: He's a bad cop, Lauren. He's from Portland. Right? He did like ten years in Vice and Homicide down there. And when he came up here he came with a lot of baggage. Like what? Defense witnesses suddenly disappearing into thin air. Like drug dealers breaking their necks falling down crack house stairs. Like when a case wasn't going his way, taking the law into his own hands. Lauren: I'm guessing you didn't get the files? No. The Duty Sergeant's a friend of mine. He's from south Jersey, Mannasquan. Married a local girl. Got stuck here worse than me. Anyway, he says, yes, Redler was in messing with the files just after you got here, but no, they didn't leave the room. Oh, he's got 'em. Gayle: You don't know that. Mark: And so what if he does? We can make the film without them. We've got great stuff here. Look at this. I'm re-cutting the stuff from the diner - it's fierce. Check it out. It's amazing how you do that. "It's not what the execution does to the community, it's what the murder does to it." It's just point and click. Oh, Mr. Modest. Okay, maybe a little more than point and click. Yeah. Maybe a lot more. "Been a loser all his life. He killed Noel, Amanda and those children." Reese didn't kill them. Mark: Oh, come on, El. We talked about this a thousand times. It's in the files. He was set up. That's crazy. We got Miss Hillsdale Forensics right here, ask her. Okay, is it possible - even with the forensics - is it possible that someone set him up? Not really. I mean, you know, that's extremely unlikely. Lauren: But possible? Oh, yes, anything is possible. Good. Then I'll go talk to the Captain tomorrow and see if I can shake something loose. Redler's not going to be happy. You know what? You've got to ask yourself why. [music] Mark: We're going to need some shots of the murder scene so I'll go to the house first thing in the morning. [music] [music] [ambulance sirens] Redler: There's been a motor vehicle accident. Right. Redler: We're on our way. Let her know. Okay. [music] [knock, knock, knock...] George: Film lady, get up! Open up! [chain guard rattles...] I got a call from the police. There's been an accident. Where's my truck? Your cameraman took it. That's why the police called. They're coming to pick you up. Lauren: I don't understand. He said he was going to get some footage of the murder scene. How did he end up out here? Redler: Get these roads cordoned off. Make sure you get someone out there on those tracks. There's two sets. One goes up, one goes this way. What happened? Your friend went off the road. Quinn: We contacted you and sent a car as soon as w What? He just came down the hill and went over the edge? I don't understand. Did the brakes fail? Quinn: I don't think it was the brakes. There are parallel tire treads coming down the hill there. Redler: Geez... So there was another car? It looks like somebody came up beside him pretty fast. And then he went over the hill and down the ravine, hit the rocks, and basically blew up. So, are you saying that you think this wasn't an accident? Maybe. Well if it wasn't an accident... [music] Lauren: How can you not know anything? How can anybody not know anything? [footsteps] They... they took him right into surgery. I don't know how long it's been. I don't know what they're doing. I don't know anything. I'll get some answers. I'm Detective Charlie Quinn. You have a patient in surgery, Mark Evans. I need to know his status right now. Ms. Wilde. We did everything we could. I am very sorry. No... [music] [music] [knock, knock, knock...] Hey. Gayle: Hello, there's a friendly face. How was Ohio? Sad. Mark wasn't married, but his mom and dad were there. And I just can't imagine that... burying your child. It was heartbreaking. You two were pretty close, weren't you? Yeah, we met at school, NYU. He shot my senior project. It was a documentary on gun control in Manhattan. But yeah, we did four movies together. And he always knew what I wanted. You know, I never even had to discuss it with him. I'd just tell him what the movie was and we'd go shoot it. He knew what I was thinking before I did. He sounds like a good friend. Yeah. My mom died when I was 14. And it was winter. There was 10 feet of snow, on the ground, and everything was cold and gray. And at the cemetery, I was frozen. And I remember feeling like a part of me had broken off and left with her, and would be gone forever. I feel that way now about Mark. So, yeah, you're right. He was a good friend. I'm sorry. Really. Thanks. How long were you gone? Two weeks. Oh, freedom. I wouldn't have come back. Well, if I can get just a couple more shots then I think I can make the Kevin Reese story work in the film, and I have to do that, you know, for Mark. Well, good for you. Did you get a chance to look at the tire treads? Yes, I was waiting for you to ask. We didn't get a clean read. I mean it's clear there are two sets of treads, but it's not clear what car they came from. I mean, obviously this thicker one is the SUV, but this one... This one could really be any full size sedan that uses V-rated tires. We just can't ID it with any kind of certainty beyond that. I'll tell you something else, though. Come here. [footsteps] The unmarked Detective sedans use V-rated tires. What are you saying? I'm saying I saw them together. You saw who? Redler and Amanda Watson. I think they were having an affair. I was there when she broke it off with him. I asked him about it, but he shot me down. I mean, he threatened me, or half threatened me, or at least I took it as a threat. It was two weeks before the murders. And you didn't tell anyone? Well, I told them. I mean, the evidence was unimpeachable, and it was never brought up in trial. I know. I figured the attorneys decided it was inconclusive, or irrelevant, or inadmissable, and who am I? I mean they must have known, right? They must have questioned him about it and decided it was nothing. Where was this? At Noel's place. We had a design meeting for the new lab. Redler was there repping for Homicide, specifics that they wanted. He had experience because he helped build the new lab down in Portland. And you just let it go? Well, I thought maybe I was wrong. I thought it was something else. Yes, I let it go. But now, the way he's been acting, the stuff that's been happening, missing files, Mark, I don't know what I think. But you definitely saw them together? Well, I wouldn't say they were together. They were in the same room... [background conversations] Gayle: Hang on. [footsteps] Amanda: It's over, Tom. Just accept it and move on. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to say I'm sorry? I don't know what the hell I did, but I'm sorry, all right? Now can we get over this, please? You didn't 'do' anything. This was never serious. It was always serious. It's still serious. You know it and I know it. All I know is that I'm not seeing you anymore. You don't get to decide that, Amanda. Yes I do. I'm seeing someone else. What did you just say? I'm said I'm seeing someone else. Who is it? It's none of your business. Who? I said it's none of your business. Do I know him? Yes. He works at Gabler's. Kevin Reese? Let go. You're hurting me. Understand something. You will not leave me for that drug addict grease monkey. He's an artist. He's a punk. I'm in love with him. You're in love with me. You tell him it's over, not me. We're over when I say we're over. Mmmmph... Hi! I'm sorry. I'm interrupting something. I was just looking for some coffee. You're out of decaf. [music] [prison buzzer] [clang] Thank you. [footsteps] Well, you heard rumors. Gayle saw her breaking it off with him. And it never came That's not right. It doesn't sound right. Well, can you ask him? He doesn't let me drive the car. I don't think he's going to open up about a secret affair with Amanda Watson. Do you want me to come in with you? Oh no, I've been on Death Row before. Just checking. Unless you want to be in the movie. No, not even close. Ah, well, you're a cop. You'd probably make Reese uncomfortable anyway. As long as I don't make you uncomfortable. Are you from Hillsdale, Quinn? Eugene. Well, what are you doing here? I followed a girl. She was a local. You know, it didn't work out. She left, I stayed. You must like it. Yeah, it grew on me. I mean it's small. It's mostly quiet. You know, the people are nice if you don't stir them up. You can manage this. It's not like Portland. You can't manage something that big. It's just too many damn people. Small-town boy, huh? Yup, looks like it. What about you? Big-city girl. I guess opposites attract. Thanks. [door buzzer] [music] Security person: Please step through. Thank you. Kevin: They moved me yesterday. They figure that's the line you cross where you try to kill yourself. Eight days to go, you're okay, but 7 days, give me the rope. Do you know who Tom Redler is? Yeah, he's a cop. Races stock cars. Amateurs, you know. I used to do work for him down at Gabler's. I think he was the other man seeing Amanda when you were seeing her. Patty Sutton told me you knew there was someone else, but you never said anything because you didn't want to risk losing what you had. I didn't want to push her away. I loved her too much. There were rumors at the police department that he was seeing her. And two weeks before the murders someone saw her breaking it off with him because she was in love with you. [music] What is it? [music] [sounds of children's laughter] I'm serious. You guys better cheer up. [children's laughter] All right, come on back. I'm done. Come on over. What do you think? Good. Who's that? Me. And who's that? Me. Who's that? You! [laughter] It's a gift. Take it. [laughter] [children's footsteps] Great girls. Thanks. It means they got a great mom. I want to kiss you for saying that, but I can't. I know. I think Noel suspects something. What do you think he'll do? Hire a detective. Follow me himself. I don't know. Maybe nothing. We just have to be really careful from now on. Oh, if he found out... What? He just can't find out. When does he get back? Tonight. I should probably go. No, no don't. Just stay for a bit. [music] You're as pretty as I remember, Miss Wilde. Does that work for you, that act? Do women respond to you? Even a blind squirrel finds a few nuts now and then. Okay. Detective Redler very recently confronted me in my office. Although 'confrontation' doesn't do descriptive justice to our tete-a-tete. Well, what did he want? He wanted to know what I know about Kevin Reese. He wanted to know what secret I've been hiding, and if it was my intention to keep it. And have you been hiding a secret, Mr. McAffrey? Let's just say that Kevin Reese's defense wasn't all it should have been. Detective Redler said that you were getting close. I'm don't really know what that means, but I've decided to err on the side of caution. That is my office address. Why don't you come by later this evening, after dark, I'll show you mine if you show me yours, so to speak. [music] Quinn: Look, I don't know where this is going, but they execute him in a week. You don't have time to take this anywhere. The pieces don't fit. I know. But Redler's not someone that you want to call out, that's all. Be careful, is what I'm saying. Okay. Lauren: Thanks for helping us out, Sgt. Devlin. Devlin: No problem. So, Dr. Lerner says you're from Mannasquan. Hey, best beach in Jersey. Miss it every day. Lauren: It's the other end of the country. Other end of the universe. Hey, she's good people, Dr. Lerner, huh? Yeah. We're both from New York, but my family spent a couple of summers on Long Beach Island, so I've got a soft spot. Ah, you've gotta love the Garden State. Okay, this is it, or... I guess, this isn't it. It's case number 30285. It's Kevin Reese - multiple homicide, conviction, sentence, execution. I told Dr. Lerner the same thing I'm going to tell you. The last one looking at the file was Tom Redler, but he didn't walk out with it. Not while I was here. Lauren: Are there always two guards on duty? Unless someone's sick, or has to hit the john. Yeah, there's always someone at the desk. And if not, they gotta sign the log book anyways. Everybody's gotta sign the log. I mean there's rules, there's regs posted everywhere. It's not like you can miss them. It's not like you can forget. I mean there's a warning on the damn door. You can't leave without seeing it. But if you were somewhere else and there was no one on the desk, and someone didn't sign the log... Well, that a big 'if', Miss Wilde. They could carry it out the door. Devlin: Well, they'd have to have a damn good reason to want to do that. What does that mean, Sergeant Devlin? [music] [music] So why is this place till empty? Gayle: It got stuck in the middle of attorney hell. Plus, would you want to live here, knowing what happened? No, probably not. No, neither would I. Lauren: Did you know Redler was out here a week before the murders. How do you know that? Your friend Sgt. Devlin. He responded to a domestic disturbance call before he transferred over to Records. So? So Redler was here. Noel was acting like Redler was the first one to respond to the call, but Devlin said, "No way". He said he was already here and that he looked like hell. Well, that doesn't mean that Redler did it, and it certainly doesn't mean that Kevin Reese didn't do it. Okay, you're the professional, what does it mean? I don't know. But something? Yeah. Something. Okay, I'm done. Good. Let's go get a beer. I got another 'something'. [music] Lauren: These transcripts are unbelievable. I mean McAffrey's even sleazy in court. When I first met him, he used to call me baby. As in, "Hey, Gayle baby, why don't you put me under your microscope?" Oh, that is somewhat gross. I told him I had an irresistible urge to slap him into next week. He called me Dr. Lerner after that. You know what I hate the most? His eyes piss me off. The way he do look you up and down thing. I hate that. I'm going to see him later tonight. I'm meeting him in his office. He said he had a secret that he wants to share with me. He said that? And I quote. That's completely gross. Hey, you want to come with me? Oh, I'd love to, but I have a root canal. I don't want to miss it. No, my book club is meeting tonight. And I wouldn't come with you anyway. Hey, it's so great that you got these. Thanks again. Oh, you're welcome again. I figured as I couldn't find the files, transcripts might help. They do. Look at this, here. Look on page 27. Oh, why don't we read it. I'll be McAffrey. You be Reese. Great. "Mr. Reese, the prosecution has spent the better part of this trial putting words in your mouth. Would you please tell the jury, in your own words, what happened the night Amanda Watson and her family were murdered?" "It was after her husband found us in the trailer." "How long after?" "I can't remember." Three hours maybe. She called, told me it was over. I could hear him in the back. He said he'd divorce her if it ever happened again, take the kids, leave her on the street with nothing." "What did you do?" "I was broken up, drinking, using. I lost track of time. I was wired and angry and yeah, I was high." [music] [slam] [music] [click] [music] [truck engine starts] [music] [engine turned off] [music] It's not right... [THUD] UMPH! [prison buzzer] [footsteps] Lauren: That's all you remember Mr. Reese? The next thing I know they're dragging me into the Emergency room. I got blood all over me. Blood on my hands. On my clothes, on my face. There's cops all over me and they're saying that I'm the one that killed Amanda. That I killed her, her husband and the kids. But you don't recall it? I can't remember. What about your lawyer? McAffrey? Ha, it was a joke. I only saw him twice before the trial. He wanted me to plead guilty. But you refused an appeal. I didn't see the point. Lauren: I'm seeing McAffrey tonight. [music] [music] [knock, knock, knock...] [music] [click] [music] Mr. McAffrey? [music] Hello? It's Lauren Wilde. [music] If you stood me up... [music] Mr. McAffrey. [music] Mr. McAffrey? HUH! Oh! [music] Okay... okay, okay.. [music] [music] Call Frawley. [music] [dialing beeps] [music] Yes, I have to report a murder. [traffic] Redler: His computer, his watch, his wallet... it plays as a robbery. So then why am I still here? Because I don't trust you. You think I You think I shot him three times, stole his stuff, took it back to my hideout, then drove all the way back to his office and called the police? I think you're in it up to your neck. I think you are. Give us a minute. I think I should stay. I think Wilde wants a drink of water. I'll be back in a little while. [footsteps] Tell me what you know. I already told you. McAffrey gave me his address. He said he had a secret that he wanted to share. I went over there, knocked on the door. There was no answer. I let myself in. He was dead in the office. I called it in and they sent you. My lucky day. I know all that already. Reese. What do you know about Reese? Oh, that's funny. 'Cause I think you should tell me what you know. You don't get it, do you? You are my prime suspect in the murder of a prominent defense attorney with deep roots in the community. McAffrey told me you threatened him. McAffrey is dead and anything he said is hearsay and inadmissible. This is fact. I am going to charge you and I'm going to hold you long enough to screw up your movie, and maybe even put the brakes on your career. Why would you go to all that trouble? Because I don't like you. It's because you're scared of what I know. You don't know anything. I know you were seeing her. I know she broke up with you to be with him. I know you went out to that house one week before they were shot. And that you know Reese from Gabler's. You race cars and he works on them for you. That the files are missing. That my friend was driven off the side of the road and killed. And now McAffrey's been murdered. I know it's all connected and that you're involved. And I'm going to put it together. You're going to run out of time. Reese is going to run out of time. Oh, that would be good for you, wouldn't it? That's what you're hoping for. It's what we're all hoping for. Don't you pay any attention to your own movie? Listen to the people you interview. This whole town is crossing its fingers that Reese pays with his life for what he did. An eye for an eye. Blood for blood. He doesn't even know what he did. He's the only one who doesn't. He left a trail, Wilde... And all we had to do was follow it, straight to two dead kids. [music] [music] [slam] [music] [bam, bam, bam...!] Oh my God. You can't be here, Kevin. You can't be here. Who the hell is that? No! [screams] Noel: Call the police! Call the police! Go on! [music] [BANG!] Uha...! [THUD] Amanda: No...! [gunfire!] [music] [music] [continuous blaring horn] [sirens] Gayle: Dr. Frawley. Sorry I'm late. You I know, you I don't. Morris Frawley. Lauren Wilde. I've seen some of your films. I particularly liked the one about interracial marriage. Nicely done. Thank you. I'm heading to x-ray. Broken wrist. Skateboarding. Obviously a sport invented by an orthopedist. I don't know what I can add to Gayle's assessment. She's much smarter than I am. Gayle: Morris, stop. Dr. Lerner would have been a wonderful clinician. Research was always my first love. Golf is my first love. So what can I do for you, Lauren? I was hoping you could put yourself back in the room with Kevin Reese, on the night of the murders. Fine. Police brought him in right from the Watson house. He was drugged, very high blood-alcohol level, a nasty gash over the right eye, and not particularly conscious. We gave him oxygen, pumped his stomach, stitched his wound. I guess you could say the mood was extremely serious. Probably the quietest I've ever seen it here. Tell me, Doctor, do you remember if there was anything unusual about Mr. Reese's exam results? Yes, there was. Gunfire at close range leaves two evidence trails. Powder residue and tissue splatter, correct? Correct. There was gunpowder residue on Mr. Reese, but there was something curious about the splatter pattern. What? There wasn't any. Oh, he was covered in Watson family blood, but it wasn't splattered. It was wiped on, painted on. But how could that be? Did this come up at his trial? If there's appropriate tissue splatter pattern to substantiate a crime, that's great for everyone. But if there isn't, there could be a half dozen reasons why not. Lauren: Like what? Well, like the police get careless. They mishandle the accused. I had one case where they actually washed the guy before they brought him in. I mean they literally washed his hands and face. Or the hospital gets careless. Frawley: Hey. Present company excluded. Thank you. Ballistics carry the burden of proof regardless of whether we can identify appropriate blood splatter. And they were a direct match. Exact match. That it? Lauren: No, there was one more thing, Doctor. I was wondering, was there any reason why you would have needed to speak with Jerry McAffrey? The lawyer? Yes. The one that was just murdered in his office? Yes. Not that I can think of. Why? Your name was on his call list. I'm on everybody's call list. What do you mean by that? Tom Redler just called about the same case. Go figure. Go figure. Kevin Reese has five days to live. Redler's hiding the evidence. I've got to get those files. [music] [music] Ohmigod. [music] [music] Huh! [music] [prison buzzer] [music] [music] Kevin: They asked me if there was anything special I wanted to eat in the next couple of days. Like anybody cares what the hell food they get when they only got three days to live. I'm not much in the mood to be in the movie today, Ms. Wilde. I'm not here for the movie. Then what? I found your case files. Where? At Redler's house. He handed them over? No, not exactly. I spoke to Dr. Frawley. He did your examination on the night of the murders. I was out of it. I know. He said there was no blood splatter pattern. He said it looked as though the blood had been wiped on you, painted on. So? So that report is in the file, but there's no mention of it in the transcript because McAffrey never brought it up in court. You were found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, Mr. Reese, and that report provides doubt, but your lawyer ignored it. He never called Dr. Frawley as a witness. He never called anyone as a witness on your behalf. Why? He came to me and he said there was a secret he wanted to tell me and that Redler had threatened him, wanted to know everything McAffrey knew. I went to meet him at his office and by the time I got there he was already dead. Jesus. Redler threatened me and my cameraman is dead. He threatened McAffrey and McAffrey's dead. He threatened Amanda. I don't think you killed Amanda Watson and her family. I think it was Redler. [music] Lauren: Here's what I think may have happened. [music] [music] [WHAM!] Uh! [music] [music] [knock, knock, knock...] [music] Tom, what're you... Ohmigod... We're over... when I say we're over. Noel: Who the hell is that? [music] Call the police! [bash!] Call the police! [BANG!] [scream] [gunfire!] [kids' screams] [gunfire!] [kids' scream] [music] [music] Quinn: Redler's gone. He signed into the Evidence Room two days ago. Took Reese's gun and the bullets they removed from the Watson family. Nobody's seen him since, and nobody knows where the hell he is. Or the evidence? Or the evidence. He's covering something. Gayle: Yeah, his trail. And he had those files the whole time. Quinn: Looks like he didn't want you snooping around. Lauren: Now I know why. He killed Mark. He was probably just hoping it was me in the car. McAffrey said that Redler threatened him, right? Redler didn't know what McAffrey knew. But he couldn't risk that the secret McAffrey was going to tell me was about him... So he killed McAffrey too. He had pictures of Amanda Watson all over his wall. And Kevin Reese has three days to live. Well, we can't prove anything without questioning Redler. Lauren: So what do we do? We find him. Before he finds us. [clicking computer keys] [phone rings] Lauren Wilde. [static] Hello? [static] I can barely hear you. [static] Who is this? [static] Detective Redler, I didn't expect to hear from you. Redler: I need to talk to you. I'd like to talk to you too. Tonight is great. Where? I do know where that is. What time? Hello... hello? [music] Quinn: Why would he choose Gabler's? Gabler gave him his own key so he could get in at night, after work. That's how he knew Reese. He doesn't want to talk. You know that, right? He'll talk to me. I don't like it. If he sees anybody with me, he won't show. He said that. He doesn't know that I got the other office key from Gabler. He's not going to be looking for me. He's going to be watching you like you said. He won't even see me. Check. Okay. Well, let's go see what that secret really is. [music] [music] [music] Redler. [music] I'm here! [music] This isn't going to go away you know. Not even once they execute Reese. It's not going to go away. [music] You dug a pretty deep hole for yourself, Detective. Stealing that evidence like that. Redler... I'm the only one who can help you now... [clatter of dropped tool] [car engine] Quinn: Lauren...! [scream] [CRASH!] ARGHH! Uh... [scream] [squeal of tires] [varoom] Uh... Ugh... [music] I had high hopes for you, Lauren. I really did. I thought we might be friends. I thought you might visit me in Costa Rica. I even tried to warn you, but you weren't smart enough to keep away. But I can't say I'm not disappointed. You killed Amanda Watson? No, I killed Noel. He found out about my retirement plan. I guess I reached a little too deep into the lab construction fund. I mean can you blame me? Millions and millions and nobody minding the shop but him. Amanda and the children were just collateral damage. I was going to put it on Redler. No one would have shed a tear to see him go down. This is his gun. It's the same gun that killed the Watsons. I took it from him a week before that sad little family was so tragically murdered. He reported it missing. But you would have come across that little tidbit of information at some point. You lied about the ballistics. Well, it wasn't hard. You can get away with anything if no one's looking in your direction. Reese didn't shoot anybody. That poor fool was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [music] I mean who would have expected him out there in the middle of the day. I guess it shouldn't have surprised me. He and Amanda hadn't exactly been what you'd call discreet about their little affair. And lately Kevin Reese's behaviour had been getting more and more erratic. [footsteps] So, there I am just putting the finishing touches on everything, and I'm coming down the stairs and I spot him out the front of the house. At first I thought, "Oh, terrific, I'm going to have to kill him too." And then I realized that with just a little extra effort this might work out perfectly. And let's face it, the guy's a drunk. I could have knocked him over with a feather. It wasn't hard. His gun, right there on the seat. And that truck just reeked of booze. It doesn't get any better than that. I knew exactly what to do. Six spent casings in his gun, a little gun powder residue on his hands, and a good chance that he was too messed up to know if he even did it or not. And who knows, maybe he would have done it if I hadn't got there first, huh? Maybe he would have shot them all for me if he'd been given half a chance. Anyway, I go back to the house, I soak up some blood from the crime scene, I smear it around. I needed it to look good enough to make it appear that Kevin Reese might have actually done it, but not so good that the evidence wouldn't point straight at Redler and a cover-up if anyone bothered to look any closer. And then, make sure the police arrive before Kevin regains consciousness. A quick call to 911. Hello, I'm a neighbor of the Watson family out here in Pine Valley. I think I just heard gunshots coming from their house. You killed Mark. Uh-huh, yes. And McAffrey, too. That moron panicked like a school boy. I convinced him that he was doing a public service by not offering up a vigorous defense. His little secret was that I paid him for his trouble. And he wasn't cheap, I'll tell you that. You think you can shoot me and get away with it? People know I'm here. People will come. Oh, I'm counting on it. I'm not going to kill you. It's Redler's gun, remember? I mean you pushed him too far this time, Lauren. And won't everyone be so terribly upset when they unwind this complicated little case and discover that Redler tampered with the evidence so ballistics would point straight to Kevin Reese? "Oh no," they'll say. "We've executed the wrong man." This time Redler takes the fall for real. [BANG] UHH! [music] [rattle of gurney wheels] He's still conscious. Yeah, he's busted up some, but he'll live. Did you know I took the files? It was either you or her. I needed to know if there was anything in those files that connected me to Amanda. The ER report said there was. Blood doesn't wipe itself off on you when you shoot someone that close. My gun was missing. I played a hunch, I took the evidence up to Portland. I got a friend in the lab there. You've got a friend? He re-ran the ballistics. They didn't match. The bullets in those bodies did not come from Reese's gun. Well, it wasn't bad science, it was just no science. It was fiction. Lerner's name was on the report. She lied on the stand. I knew she was in on it. I didn't follow you here. I followed her here. You got lucky. Yeah. About that... Redler... Look, Wilde. Forget it. We're not going to be friends. Quinn wired you, right? Uh, yeah. Make sure the Governor gets the tape. [music] [siren] [footsteps] Kevin: Just paperwork now. A couple of days, they say. Lauren: What then? I don't know. Death Row's not the kind of place you make a whole lot of plans, you know. Probably Arizona... or New Mexico. Someplace hot that gets a lot of sun, you know. What about you? I will finish this movie. Make another movie. Keep going. You paid a heavy price. You lost a friend. I'm sorry. Thank you. And I wanted to say thank you. I read that you make these movies to figure out how you feel about the issues. Yeah, I figure if I'm on the fence about something, or I have questions about it, then other people must feel that way, too. You still on the fence about capital punishment? No. There are arguments on both sides, but the bottom line is it's just too easy to make a mistake you can never take back. A mistake you can't take back. Like me. Like you. You going to put that in the movie? I just did. [music]
