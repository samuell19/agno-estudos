You should be promoted and continue to fight for Qin. What's your name? King Ying Zheng. - Your Majesty! - Don't move. You die a brave warrior of Qin. Directed By Chen Kaige Chapter One: The King Of Qin The Queen Mother's Quarters Prime Minister Lu Buwei at the Queen Mother's service. If I am not mistaken... it has been almost seven years since we last met. The Queen Mother has a fine memory. That was when he first entered into your service. And look at his achievement. Today he bears the title of Marquis. It's not the fault of the Marquis. After all, he used to be your retainer. Where would he be today if you had not given him the opportunity to serve me? Marquis or not... he is still your servant. How true. However... I do enjoy his company a great deal. It is time my son should get married. The Marquis has found a lady for him. She is a princess from the Kingdom of Han. The princess calls me her uncle. Are you aware... that your son is going to eliminate Han? Really? If Han is eliminated, won't my homeland of Zhao be next? What will happen to my position if Zhao is eliminated? I have no interest except the well-being of the Queen Mother. But if Qin eliminates the other six kingdoms... who will pay tribute to Her Majesty? Clever, aren't you? Take good care of the Queen Mother for me. Trust me... I have no interest in politics. But I must ask... once the six kingdoms are eliminated... what use will the king have for you... the prime minister? Then allow me to congratulate you on your son's marriage. The King's War Council All of Han is in our hands, except for the capital. The city has been under siege by our troops for almost 30 days. The Han people have lost their will to defend. But our provisions can only last for seven days. Therefore, I beg you to make a final decision as to war or peace. If we destroy Han, the whole world will be shocked. What if all six kingdoms join forces against us? It's in our best interest to preserve Han. I disagree. We have amassed enough troops to take the Han capital with ease. There's no reason to accept a stalemate... when you can have victory. Li Si, you are not the prime minister yet. - Han Ambassador. - Present. You are free to return to Han. Yes, Your Highness. The king and the nobles of Han will be eternally grateful to you... for preserving Han. That's fine. Prime Minister, I want a drink. Bring me some wine. This is not a toast... this is a punishment. Why am I punishing myself... when I should be celebrating? Because... we have 250,000 troops ready... to attack the Han capital! But instead... I have been advised not to destroy Han. That it is in our best interest to preserve Han. I should be punished for keeping my silence. Li Si, repeat what you have said! Your Majesty... are you also punishing me with this drink? No, I'm punishing myself... for allowing you to remain prime minister until today. It doesn't matter who is king. I will always be... the prime minister. In the name of Qin, kill Lu Buwei! I dare you. Prime Minister. Please! I have no choice but to dismiss Prime Minister Lu. Li Si... issue the following decree: Remove Mr. Lu's title... but give him 5,000 tons of grain... 100 pounds of gold, 10 good horses. Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, I ask to be dismissed as the commanding officer. I'll stay at home and await my punishment. You're going to take the Han capital in seven days. But if you fail, how should I punish you? Cut off my head! But Your Majesty, I hear that you will marry a Han princess. I don't want your head... I want your horse. You have a wonderful steed. How do you judge a good horse? By his teeth. Wrong. By his eyes. You can tell everything about an animal... from his eyes. Marquis? Yes, Your Majesty? I understand that you'll be my uncle? This is the Queen Mother and the prime minister's idea. You're always so busy. Please come riding with me today. I'm afraid of heights. I can't ride. Afraid of heights, are you? Even on a horse's back? Your Majesty, it tickles. General Fan. His Majesty asks the Marquis, is it high or not? As high as high can be. Cross! Cross! Remove your robe. How much is two times three? Two times three is six. How much is three times three? Whatever His Majesty wishes it to be! Marquis, what's wrong? The Queen Mother is worried. I've just been entertaining His Majesty. That way he'll trust me. Lady Zhao has arrived. - Good morning, Lady Zhao. - Good morning. Good morning, My Lady. When you think of it... my son's marriage is quite unfair to Lady Zhao. When we were hostages in Zhao... Ying Zheng's father could not do housework. Nor could I. So we hired her to help out. She was only this high. When she had free time, she would help Ying Zheng herd horses. She was such a nice girl and beautiful. No wonder my son loved her so much. She possesses a strong will and a somewhat wild personality. It might be hard to reign her in. Do you think she has changed her ways? No. When we were allowed to return to Qin... she had no intention of coming with us. Ying Zheng started to cry. She laughed and said... ''What are you crying about? I'll go with you.'' So she joined us. Your Majesty... I've come to say farewell. Where are you going? I'm going home to Zhao. Why are you leaving me? Why? Your daily visits seem more like an obligation. Is this what our love has become? Do you still know what I want? How I want to live? You don't. I must smile all the time... speak softly and walk gently with my head down. I feel like an object on display in your palace! I want to speak in a loud voice. Cry when I feel like crying. I don't want to be nice to everybody. I can't live like this... but I have for so long. I'm leaving. Do you remember when we were young? When it snowed in the winter... we frolicked in the hay. We were cold and hungry, but we were happy. We would fall into the hay. It was so warm... we would fall asleep... in each other's arms. You used to be an innocent boy from Zhao. Now you are a king. You are no longer the person I once knew. You are right. Now I understand why you want to leave. I was only waiting for the day when... I would be king of all under heaven... then I would marry you and make you my queen. I thought that this was what you wanted. Let's go back to Zhao. Then we can be together again. The way it was before. I know this is only a dream. Day is breaking. Please accompany me to the Imperial Map Hall. Then you may go. Unfurl the map. Your Majesty, this is the map of the unified empire. You painted this map? Yes, Your Majesty, it is their work. You've done a fine job. Are you from Qin? Your Majesty, they are from Han. I see. Yes, Han will soon be eliminated. You are crying for your kingdom. You are loyal subjects of Han. All the people of Han are crying now... because your king orders gifts to be presented to Qin-- 1,000 horses, 10,000 pounds of gold... 1 million sheaves of silk. I don't want these gifts. They belong to the people of Han. Han will cease to exist. But... a greater empire will emerge. Qin and the other six kingdoms... as far as the eye can see will be unified. All people under heaven will be its subjects. The empire will have only one ruler... one benevolent ruler. Once unification is achieved... he will protect... all his subjects. The empire will be divided into provinces... under the administration of good officials. Grain will grow everywhere. There will be peace and prosperity for all. Roads will extend to the remote border areas... and the Great Wall will stretch across the northern border... to keep the barbarians out. And to commemorate the unification... stone tablets will be erected by the sea. Lady Zhao, please stay with us! Your Majesty! Our army has commenced the final attack on the Han capital. Your Majesty! Let me go! Ying Zheng! How dare you! Let him come to me. Kneel before His Majesty! I am the Prince of Yan. I won't kneel before the king. Carry on. Lady Zhao, don't leave. I request that Your Majesty stop the Qin invasion of Han... and leave the six kingdoms in peace. Otherwise-- Then what? Within five steps... blood will be shed, yours and mine. Even if you kill me... someone will complete the unification. If not me... then maybe you. After 550 years... what has become of the hundreds of kingdoms? Today there are only seven left. Small kingdoms want to become bigger... the bigger ones want to annex the smaller. This war has lasted for 550 years. The people have been living... in hell. As long as the six kingdoms remain... the world will never know peace. The six kingdoms must be eliminated. Nobody can stop the unification. Nobody. Nobody. The truth is as long as Qin remains... the world will not know peace. Don't come near me! Don't move! I know you are unhappy as my hostage here in Qin. I could let you go back to Yan... but the King of Yan will simply send you back here again. He will do this until Yan is eliminated. Why break your father's heart? I have raised my sword before Your Majesty. Why don't you kill me? You are my brother. Your Majesty, bowl! Your Majesty, bowl again! Qin Eliminates Han A great feast for our soldiers! Now it's time to consider... how to take Yan. Once Yan is eliminated... the northern territories will be united. Once we control the north, unification will be close at hand. But I must have a reason to attack Yan. Otherwise, the southern kingdoms... unite against us. Why don't you let the Prince of Yan go back? Go back. Where to? Back to Yan. If you let him return to Yan, he'll send an assassin to kill you. As soon as the assassin makes an attempt, everyone will know... and you'll have your reason. Yan may even surrender without bloodshed. How can we make him send an assassin? Find someone he trusts. Who? Who? Do I have a beautiful face? Most beautiful. What if it is branded? My Lady must be joking. Prison warden at your service, My Lady. Please rise. Warden. Present. Who are those prisoners? Common criminals, war prisoners. - Is branding difficult? - No. Is there someone you want released? I can take care of it. I want you to brand my face. What did My Lady say? I said, I want you to brand my face. My Lady has scared me to death. I never d-a-r-e do such a thing! You dare to disobey me? My clothes, do they look nice? Yes, they do. Don't get them dirty. No, I won't. Do you have a heavy hand? No, I don't. Does it hurt? No. Even if it hurts... don't scream. I won't scream. I won't. What have you done? Let me look. I'm going to kill that warden! Don't punish them. It was my idea. What? If I didn't do it, Prince Yan wouldn't trust me. So you are the one who will go to Yan with him? That way I can make him send an assassin. Once I succeed, there will be no need for bloodshed. Do you think this is child's play? War is everywhere. Dead bodies are piled as high as mountains... blood flows like the rivers. Didn't you say that you would protect the people of all kingdoms? Didn't you promise to let them live in peace? You said that and I believed you. As long as you see this mark on my face, you will never forget your promise. My face... is it ugly? It's beautiful. For the past few years... we've been drifting apart. You are the King of Qin. I didn't know what I could do for you. That was why I wanted to return home to Zhao. Now I know that you are... different from other kings. You have a great cause. Finally, I've found a way to help you. Sorry to keep you waiting, my lord. Where's the king? The king is otherwise occupied. His Majesty has asked me to drink with you. - Ridiculous. - Just a moment. His Majesty has something to show you. If you don't have a look, you will regret it. This way, please. Turn around. This is the unification map. Han is part of the unified country. So is Yan. So are all six kingdoms! His Majesty has asked me to tell Your Highness... Yan is sure to be eliminated. Your Highness is welcome to stay here in Qin. You can no longer be the Prince of Yan... but my king will grant you... a position as a Qin official. Also, His Majesty has a message for you. Your friend, Lady Zhao's face has been branded... because she repeatedly asked to return home. The brand cannot be removed. Please think it over. Please tell the king... Yan will never surrender. I want to receive the Yan assassin... right here in the Unification Hall. I want you to find me a real assassin. I'll order the guards to stay away. Nobody will be armed... except the assassin. Who would have thought... I'm going to Yan... to find someone to kill you. I'm invincible. No one can kill me. The assassin will know it is wrong to even try. Keep this to protect yourself. Good-bye. My amulet... please take it too. Wait. Now you may go. Please, don't look at me. What does this bridge... remind you of? Remember when we were children... and you would make me cross that narrow bridge? I have made a replica of that bridge here... so that we can always remember our times together. I am the Prince of Yan! I am the Prince of Yan! If you want to kill me, then do it right here. Goddamn Ying Zheng! Shepherd! Is this the Kingdom of Yan? This is Yan. Goddamn Ying Zheng! I'm going to kill you. Goddamn you! I must kill you! Chapter II: The Assassin Jing Ke... I have someone I want you to kill. Who is it? A sword maker... who owes me. Just him? Kill his whole family. How much? Five thousand. I want ten thousand. Mommy. Daddy. You've killed my whole family, haven't you? Then kill me too. You can't see. I won't kill you. Kill me. If you don't... I'll be begging for the rest of my life. There's no dignity in that. That's true... but I won't kill you. The Homecoming Of Prince Yan Gentlemen... Yan may soon be eliminated by Qin. I must find an assassin to kill the King of Qin. If you are afraid to accept this task... you may take your leave. Leave? We would rather die! All right then, cheers. Jing Ke! You madman. The buns are ready. Got you! You little bastard! How many times did you steal? Many. Many? Then there is nothing to say. Water. Water. I need water. Give him some water. Give him some water. What? You pay up for him... and he'll get his water. Get out, you scum! Give him some water. Are you looking for trouble? We've got water. Get down and beg and he'll get his water. If you let him go, I will. Fine. On your knees and I'll let him go. Crawl through my legs and I'll let him go. Let him go. That's not enough. I can let him down... but that's my decision... not yours. You have to kill me. Kill me and the boy goes free. I won't kill you. Come on! Kill me! Come on! I won't. You have no choice. Kill me! Come on! Kill me! - Did you kill that man? - No. If you didn't kill him, then why are you here? This is your last day alive. Do you have anything you want to say? Fine. You're a tough man, aren't you? Get him ready. Get him ready. Scared? Then scream. Come on! Scream! Scream, scream! All right. Let's play for a while. Lady Zhao has arrived. Hold it. Your Ladyship. Release him. Hurry, release the prisoner. Faster! This man has no fear of death. Everyone cries for mercy on the torture log, but he didn't. I should have gone over to the jail to welcome you myself. Sorry you had to suffer. Please sit. So, the two of you have met before. So you're the great assassin,Jing Ke. The prince has been searching for you. Who would imagine? The great assassin has become a sandal peddler. Lady Zhao and I need your help. I'll let the lady tell you. We want you to kill someone for us. Do you know who we want you to kill? The King of Qin. Otherwise, Yan is finished. All six kingdoms will be eliminated. I don't kill people. You're an assassin! You've killed many people! Not anymore. You will be rewarded. Tell me what you want and it's yours. If you kill the King of Qin... you're assured a place in Yan's ancestral temple. I won't kill. Then go back to the prison and die. This beautiful woman has been branded by the King of Qin. She saved your life. You owe her. I won't kill. Guards! Take him back to prison. That's the man I want. No matter what, you must make him go to Qin within three months. He must kill the King of Qin. I can't force him. He doesn't even fear death. You'd better find someone else. He has three months to live. So do you. Don't forget, you're my hostage. Jing Ke... I know what you are thinking. You think I saved you to make you kill someone? You are wrong. I was told that you were a cruel assassin. I don't believe it. I saw you save that child. I don't know about our past... but now you can go. Please go home. Scream if you can't take it. Scream. Hey! Trying to kill someone? That's not a sword! I'm sorry. You don't know me. But I do. You don't know me. Nobody does. And I don't know you either. I come from the Kingdom of Zhao. I was born and brought up in Zhao. Then I followed some people to Qin... and finally I came to Yan. Why is your face branded? What crime have you committed? I wanted to return to Zhao. Was it really that important? Zhao is my home. You are not a criminal. Wanting to return to Zhao is not a crime at all. But killing is. I've killed many people. I am the criminal. I once killed a girl. She was from a family of sword makers. The girl was young, still in her early teens. She was pretty and pure. But she was blind. You've killed my whole family, haven't you? Then kill me too. You can't see. I won't kill you. She kept asking me to kill her. But I didn't want to. At dawn, I hear my mother... making breakfast. When the sun comes up... I hear my father making swords. After sunset, my brother sings as he brings in the cows. He always brings me a flower. If I can't hear these sounds tomorrow... I would rather die. I couldn't kill her. Who are you? Even a killer... has a name. I've lost my strength. Help me remove the dagger. Actually, she wanted revenge. She had a sword hidden behind her back. She couldn't live without love. She was right. She was right. Oh, no! You're left-handed. My name is Jing Ke. You should tear down this house... build a new one. Plant some trees. If I can come to see you, I will. If I can't... don't blame me. Try to start a new life. I want you to have this. The King of Qin has started troop movements. There are 400,000 soldiers at the Han Zhao border. The people of Zhao are terrified. The Marquis says that when Zhao is eliminated... the next target will be Yan. Your medicine, my lord. Qin Palace This battle-ax... should only be used by the king. Of course, the Prince of Yan knows... that this gift might cost me my head. But I can't refuse such a fine gift. Please thank him. My lord, the king is waiting to see the Queen Mother. No. Tell him that Queen Mother is sleeping. Wrong. Let's try again. Daddy. Our poor children. Must they hide away here in the palace all their lives? Chapter III: The Children Ying Zheng has a good appetite. You've always loved meat. But we didn't always have meat. My queen, are you criticizing the king for eating too much? His Majesty is the master of all under heaven. He can have whatever he wants. Daddy. Pardon me, Your Majesty. This is my nephew. The queen adores him and has allowed him a short stay in the palace. Like all small boys, he likes to run about. Come here. Come. The king is calling you. What a fine boy. I see why the Queen Mother adores him. Open your mouth. Go on. It was a nice dinner. I have something to take care of. Good-bye, Mother. Good-bye, Your Majesty. Your Majesty! The Marquis' rebels were armed. They could have killed you. Your Majesty's wisdom prevented this. The Marquis is staging a coup. I must deploy the royal guards! Don't worry, Your Majesty. I will-- General Fan, let go of my hand. You think that I am scared. Marquis. I want the Queen Mother's seal. The order must come from the Queen Mother. The Residence Of Former Prime Minister Lu Buwei The seal is real. The Queen Mother has declared... as soon as we succeed, you will be reinstated as prime minister. So I will be the prime minister? Then who will be the king? The King of Qin? You... or your son? Marquis... you used to be my servant. I am advising you to give yourself up. With the support of the Queen Mother, your life may be spared. Otherwise... I don't mean to boast... but who can overthrow the king except me? I understand. We will see who will be king... my son or yours? What do you mean? A disgraced prime minister... has the nerve to kill me? I don't think so. Get me my chariot. I am going to the palace. Marquis! The Queen Mother has declared... Ying Zheng is no longer the King of Qin! Whoever captures him... will be rewarded. Charge! Retreat! Retreat to the west! Marquis, do you surrender? Do you surrender? - No! - No! - Charge! - Charge! I surrender... only if you promise... not to kill my men! I have failed all of you. Obey their orders. Do not resist. The king will spare you. Lay down your weapons. Stand up! Ying Zheng, you murderer! You murderer! Mother, hand those children over. They are my sons. I'll never give them up. So be it. I'm not mistaken... am I? Mommy! Mommy! Ying Zheng. Who did you have in mind to replace me... the older one or the younger? Ying Zheng, listen to me! Mommy, Mommy! I'm begging you! I'm begging you! They are your brothers. Goddamn you! I hate you! You've murdered my sons! You animal! I'm so sorry. But our children... are dead. So they're gone. Then there's nothing more to worry about. I've failed you. No, it is I who failed you. And failed our sons. All our efforts have come to nothing. People will say it's my lust for power... that brings me to my death. But what I wanted most... was to share my life with you. That could have been... were you not... the Queen Mother. As it is... we will have to wait until our next life. Don't cry. We've done nothing wrong. Farewell. Are you guilty? I'm innocent! You committed adultery and fathered illegitimate children! You plotted against Qin with foreign kingdoms. You deserve no mercy! It's true. I had children with your mother. You claim to be a filial son... but how could you know the loneliness of the Queen Mother? I plotted with foreign kingdoms? Were you not raised on the milk of the Kingdom of Zhao? Treason? Am I the traitor? No, it's you who are the traitor. When the Qin Prince was a hostage in Zhao... Lu Buwei gave him a woman. But the woman was already pregnant by Lu Buwei. She gave birth to a boy. Later... the Qin Prince became king. When the king died, the little boy inherited the Qin throne. Do you have to ask me who your real father is? What a pity. You have been the King of Qin for such a long time... but you don't even know who your real parents are! What a joke! The King of Qin is not even a descendant of Qin? You are the son of Lu Buwei from Zhao. Who's the traitor here? Nonsense! Nonsense! You're crazy! Ying Zheng... you're a bastard from Zhao! Go and ask your father! You may take your leave. Master of Rites. Present. Who is my father? Your Majesty's father was the King of Qin. Your Majesty has no other father. I see. Thank you. Qin Ancestral Temple Lu Buwei, are you guilty? Of course I am guilty. If the King of Qin, Ying Zheng, is my son... then he could not be the King of Qin. That's why I am guilty? Right? The King of Qin is not your son. His father was the King of Qin. If that is true... and the king is not my son... then why do you want to kill me? Right here in the Qin Ancestral Temple? - Prime Minister! - Stop! Say no more. Just go ahead and kill me. Your Majesty... the prime minister had made great contributions to Qin. I beg you to show mercy on him. Prime Minister... just tell the world... that I am not your son. Kill me, and the world will know... that you are not my son. And only by killing me can you make people believe... that you are not my son. Because... a son would never kill his own father. No! No. I will not kill you. I just want to tell the world... that I'm not your son. - And when unification is achieved-- - No matter what happens... don't you have a father? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Because I wanted you to be king. King of all under heaven. I cannot kill you. I want to see you grow old. I want you to help me unite all under heaven. I want you to finish your book '' Lu's Spring and Autumn.'' '' Lu's Spring and Autumn.'' I want everything under heaven... to know and remember your name. Remember your name. King Ying Zheng... have you forgotten the commandment of your Qin ancestors to unite... all under heaven? I have not forgotten! Have I forgotten? From the moment I was born, I was a hostage, who supported me? The people of Zhao spat in the king's face and whipped me! Where were the Qin people at that time? Where were my Qin ancestors? I had no food, no clothes. What did the Qin people give me? This man... he raised me and took care of the king. He brought our family back to Qin. I was sitting on his knees... when he taught me my first word. That first word was ''king.'' He who taught me how to be a king! I cannot kill him. No one can kill him! Your Majesty, then kill me. But even if I die, people will ask the same question. I cannot kill him. I can't. Please don't make me. King Ying Zheng... have you really forgotten your commandment? Your Majesty! Father. Issue the following decree. Lu Buwei is a traitor. He is to be stripped of all his titles. Kill his entire family. What's going on with Jing Ke? I can't wait anymore. He must go to Qin now. He is not the man he used to be. He'll never go. He listens to you. If you ask him to go, he will. But I won't do that. If Jing Ke won't go to Qin... I'll have to imprison you... and wait for Ying Zheng to save you. All right, then. Imprison me. As you wish. Release her. You stay and she goes free. You should see our new house. Get him! Come on! Go home, boy. Pick up your sword. If he won't kill you, kill him! Go home. Kill him! Kill! Your Majesty, General Fan fled last night. His whereabouts are unknown. Issue the following decree to the other kingdoms. Any state that harbors General Fan is the enemy of Qin. Whoever turns him in is our ally. Kill his entire family. General Fan, I'd like you to meet Jing Ke. Yes. You are from Qin. You know the King of Qin. What kind of man is he? He truly is a king... but he has killed so many people. Is that the reason you left him? Yes. Long live the king! Long live the king! General Wang. Present. I want revenge. Yes. Destroy Zhao! Zhao Ambassador! Your Highness, My Lady, I beg you to save Zhao! What's the situation in the Zhao capital? The King of Qin is leading the attack. The Qin army has already reached the city wall. They've taken all the provisions. Without food... the people are desperate! They eat... meat off the dead bodies. The King of Zhao has ordered that we die before surrendering. I am afraid we can't hold very long, and-- What? The King of Zhao is holding all the city's children... boys and girls... captive in the ancestral temple. On the day Qin troops take the city... all of them will be led to the city wall... and sacrificed. The Zhao king will destroy the future generations of Zhao. My Lady... in a few dozen years... there will be no more Zhao people. We're finished! The world is finished! Goddamn Ying Zheng! I said he was evil! General Fan! Present. The prince has promised to try and save Zhao. I am leaving now to see the King of Zhao. I will beg him to spare the children of Zhao. I also want to see the King of Qin. He's changed completely... since you left. Our king will listen to me. Chapter IV: Lady Zhao Jing Ke. I'm going to Zhao. You're going to Zhao? Is there nothing you wish to say to me? You don't want to bid me farewell? I won't send you off... because I don't want to lie to you. You can't save the Kingdom of Zhao. But I know you must go... because you are from Zhao. Zhao... is your homeland. Do your best. Zhao Outpost - Twenty Miles From The Capital My Lady! The Qin troops have surrounded the Zhao capital. The roads have been cut off. It's impossible for us to enter the city. Where is the Prince of Yan? Where is he? Zhao is finished. We must retreat. Prince, it's getting dark. We could launch a surprise attack. Outside The Zhao Capital I've conquered almost all of Zhao! We are preparing to attack the capital. Tomorrow that capital will be ours! What about the assassin from Yan? I am so naive. I thought because of you... there would be no more bloodshed. But what did I find when I arrived in Zhao? Dead bodies everywhere! Your army had done nothing but kill. The villages have been destroyed, the towns ruined. You did all of this! How are you different from other kings? But this is Zhao. Zhao is a different case. You promised me... that you would protect all people under heaven. Look at my face. Do you remember now? Zhao is different! The Zhao people bullied my father and insulted my mother. They made me herd horses. But your mother is from Zhao. So many Zhao people have helped you through hard times. Your own name used to be Zhao Zheng. Your Majesty... you cannot be the ruler of all under heaven... as long as you have hate in your heart. The ruler of all under heaven should love all people under heaven. No matter which kingdom they are from... they are your subjects. The King of Zhao has given orders to kill all the children of Zhao. Go save the children of Zhao. If you save them... you will win the love of the Zhao people... and the love of all people under the heaven. Can you promise me? I promise you. I promise you. Lady Zhao, I won't let you go. I'll never let you go again. I am from Zhao. I can't bear to watch Qin troops destroy my homeland. My Lady, this is a military campsite... but the prince didn't take this route when he came. The prince must have retreated. We must go directly to the capital. Children... the time has come. Children!Jump! Jump! My child, go quickly! Go quickly! Zhao will never surrender! - General Wang. - Present. Are these the last of the Zhao children? Yes. Let them go. Yes. Take this. - General Wang. - Present. When my father and I returned to Qin... the King of Zhao sent soldiers after us. He was afraid I would take revenge. Right now, I'm also afraid. I understand. Wake up, wake up! My Lady, over here! - More dead bodies! - No! It was Qin soldiers. They buried all these children alive. My Lady, are you all right? Goddamn Ying Zheng. Goddamn you, Ying Zheng! You are sick. You've been sleeping for five days. So long? You died, but then you came back to life. But I do not want to live. I want to go back to Zhao. I want to be with those children. I know. Your Majesty, General Fan has been found in Yan. Order Yan to deliver the traitor's head. - Your Majesty-- - Shut up! The Queen Mother is dying. Mother. Mother. You've finally come. I've just returned from Zhao. I've killed all our enemies. We have been avenged. Goddamn you! I must tell you. The King of Qin and I created this whole plot... to send an assassin to Qin. At that time... I was his lover-- we grew up together. When we were young... my father was always drunk. Often Ying Zheng would carry him home. It was a big burden for a small boy. He took good care of his mother too. Everybody liked him. He used to be such a good person. Now... he's a ruthless killer. Ying Zheng knows everything. He will be prepared. If you go-- I won't let him kill any more children. Never again. Do you think I can stand up to the King of Qin? Yes, but you still need one more thing for your journey. Without it, you won't get to see him. I've come here to borrow it from you. You don't need to borrow it. I'm giving it to you. It's a gift for a worthy friend. Because... you will never come back. You don't think I know that? You know that. Of course I know. Do you know why the King of Qin wants my head? Because I alone know the secret that can destroy him. But I can't tell you what it is. If you see him... I want you to tell him that... I've not told a soul about his secret... and that his secret will die with me. I am going to get more wine. Jing Ke... do you know which direction... my door faces? It faces Qin. Correct. Your Majesty... the Prince of Yan has sent this map. This the richest area... of Yan. The land is so fertile-- We succeeded. No. The King of Qin will react as you have. He will focus all his attention on me. Therefore, my assistant should make the first move. Not me. But I will not have a weapon. Try again. Your Majesty. The Prince of Yan has sent this map. This is the richest area of Yan. The land is so fertile. The wind is whistling Over the cold Yi River The brave hero leaves He'll never return Chapter V: The Emperor and the Assassin His Majesty! Come closer. Sit with me for a while. How old are you? I'm talking to you. Your Majesty, I'm 15. Already an adult. Old enough to do great things. I was younger than you... when I was in Zhao. Those were the good old days. I never had enough to eat or enough to wear. But I was determined to become a king. My girlfriend told me that... one day I would surely be a king. Indeed, those were the best times. Your Majesty, the envoy from Yan has arrived. Will you receive him tomorrow? Yes. Who is the envoy? His name is Jing Ke. Our spies in Yan would say that he is a great swordsman. Let him come with his sword. But be prepared. Yes. Yan envoys, please halt. The swords of the envoys need to be inspected. Your assistant cannot carry his sword. Please. Your sword will be returned. Long live the king! Long live the king! It was a fly. Is this the map you will present to the king? Yes. The box... contains the head of the traitor. The king summons the Yan envoy. The king grants you permission to carry your sword. Here is your sword... please. The king summons the envoys! Long live the king! Long live the king! What's wrong with your assistant? We are from a small country, isolated and unsophisticated. I said he would be scared. You see he really is. Don't be afraid. We'll go home after we pay homage to the king. The king will only receive one envoy. Now you've done it. Jing Ke. Your Majesty! What's your name? Jing Ke. Jing Ke. - Raise your head. - I dare not. Raise your head! Why are you crying? My secret is scared, and I am scared too. I'd like to go home. Have you brought me General Fan's head? Yes. Come up here. Please forgive me, Your Majesty! I don't want to carry a sword, but they forced me to. They sent me here to kill you! Did you hear what he said? The King of Yan... intends to kill me. Destroy Yan! Destroy Yan! The map... is it fake as well? Fake? The map is real. Your Majesty, the Prince of Yan has sent this map. This is the richest area of Yan. This can be yours. The land is so fertile-- Stand back! Draw your sword! My king! Not even a single one of you... tried to stop him! Get out of here! Goddamn you! Get out of here! Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why did you want to kill me? Do you know what I want to do? I want to establish a great empire. Qin and the other six kingdoms will become one great empire. General Fan asked me to deliver a message to you. Your secret-- Your secret-- He has not told a soul. He's not like you. He kept his promise. Don't die. I haven't won yet. You've come back to me. I've come back... only to take Jing Ke's body back to Yan. If you don't allow me... then you can kill me too. Take him back to Yan. Give him a proper burial. My love! King of Qin... have you forgotten the commandment of your ancestors to unify... all under heaven? In 221 B.C., the King of Qin conquered all six kingdoms by military force... to become the First Emperor of unified China. His success was short-lived... as the Qin Dynasty lasted only for 15 years and was overthrown by the Han. His tomb remains in Xian, guarded by thousands of terra-cotta warriors.
