I've heard that you can't choose where you come from... but you can choose where you go from there. My life wasn't always like this. Choices I made led me closer to the edge. Those choices, they didn't just lead me here, they led me to something I never thought could be real. Paging Dr. Redda, paging Dr. Redda. Please come to OR 9. Help! Help! - He's hurting my mom! - What happened? She's down on the ground, she's not moving! Stay here. Oh! Stupidspook. John, run! Dilauded... Benzos... and Xanax. - Good haul, John. - Little man with the plan. Welcome to the family. Now we brand you so you can hang with us. No. No, Rory! No, I don't want this. Stop, let me go! No! I wanna go back, I wanna go home. This is gonna be your new home for the time being, all right? Can you send a message to my mom? Of course. Tell her I think she's shit. Hey, no, listen to me. Let me do my job, I'm gonna fix this, okay? They adopt kids out of here all the time. I'm gonna find you a good home, you hear me? Okay? It'll be alright. Come on, let's go. No, don't tell her that. Tell her... Tell her to take me back! Please, take me back! I... I'll promise I'll be a good boy! I promise! This is your bunk here, and this is Jose. Breakfast is at seven, school's at eight. You'll figure the rest out. There's toilet paper right there for when you cry. I got a few rules. You best learn them if you don'twant to get your ass... Got a hickey from your cellmate already? No, from your sister. Ah! We got ourselves an Aryan brother up in here. See you around the cellblock, bitch. So John... Your mom passed away. I am so sorry to be the one to have to tell you this. But she had a heart attack. I think it was caused by a drug overdose. If there's anything I can do for you, let me know. Yeah. Leave. - Hey, there he is. Check him out. - Oosh. - Come on! Come on! Knock it off! McCord, get over here! What? McCord! Damn. Now, what the hell do you want? I found you a potential family. A couple. They're here right now. Listen, I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get you this, and it's been not easy with your record. I told them your story. - Fine. So how does this work? Anything to get me the hell out. The fostering period is a year. You gotta think about it as probation. Now you violate it in any way, if you have any scuffs with the authorities, they are gonna bounce you back in here. Oh yeah. So it's another jail, huh? Listen, I've heard about these fights you've been in. You're gonna die in here. All you gotta do is last a year and you'll be eligible for adoption. Come on, John, you're smart. I've seen your test scores. - Hell, yeah. - Yeah. The guard showed me your art. Please... 'cause this is your only shot. Come in. Hi, you must be John. I'm MaryAnna Buultjens. And this is... This is my husband, Eldridge. It's a pleasure to meet you, John. You mind if we take a seat? Is that a swastika on your head?- So? You should do the other side, even it out. I'm sorry, he likes to tease. We've been a little nervous about this day, and... and here it is. And we are... we're so excited to get to know you. Where are you from? - Me? The west end of town. No. Where are your roots? Kentucky. Good fried chicken. That's cute. I bet you don't have any of that in here. I studied at Berkeley, got my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. Which is where we met. I was majoring in Linguistics. Hmm. And what about you, John? Why don't you tell us something about yourself? There's not much to tell. What's this that you... You brought? Something you want us to see? I... I'd love to see it, whatever it is. May I? Thank you. This is a... This is good. This is really good, John. Odysseus and the Cyclops. You like Homer? He's okay. A bit dense, but entertaining enough. I'm just curious to know, out of all the trials, what made you choose this one? You're the college guy. Well, Cyclops is a brute. He's mean as hell. Blinding it, Odysseus uses human intellect to overcome savagery and escape the cave. All on his own. All on his own. It doesn't have to be. Here we are. They pay a guy like you enough to live like this? I thought only athletes and rappers made this kind of dough. John, I'm an engineer. I'm a specialist in my field, fixing problems others can't figure out. As a matter of fact, I'm currently working on a water dam problem in Central Valley. Eldridge has a dam problem. Why are you guys doing this? You see, she felt we weren't complete. Me, I suggested a dog. She wanted a child. Now you're here. John, would you like something to drink? No, thanks. Your room is to the left. Feel free to roam the house. You two put this room together for me? Yeah. MaryAnna did some clothes shopping. She went to the local hangouts. Searched the Internet. Tried to get a sense of what your age was wearing. So I'm a fun little project for you two. I could think of projects that are a bit more fun. Dinner's in 45 minutes. Well, I really think you're going to like. Eldorado High school. Yeah, the school year has just begun, so you haven't missed much. You know, we can help you with any... - No, thanks. I don't need your help. I do what I can for this ungrateful family! - There's no jobs. Country has gone to shit. - Stop making excuses! Just feed your kids. You look handsome. I... I saw those shoes on a commercial, and they just seem... I like them. Well, I figured that you might want to... Okay. It's better than a band-aid, right? I'll get out here. Yo, watch it. Whoah! Whoo! Hey, that's a cute outfit. Nice shoes, bro. I think my little sister has those same ones. - You got a problem? - Ooh! You're the new kid, right? Sit down, gentlemen. Not in the mood. Lucky, lucky. Now. Tough guy, hmm? You too, Mr. McCord. Phones away, or I confiscate. Don't let him get to you. Anything that's not a mirror reflection of himself makes him feel uncomfortable. Interestingly enough, as I was grading your quizzes, I was perplexed as to how many of you didn't even bother to skim the chapter I assigned. D minus? Some of your best work. Who was one of Greece's most famous inventors? Artemis? Archimedes. A scientist in the making should know this. Okay, you've been spending too much time on the board and not enough time in the books. Crash and burn, weird science. Zip it. Okay, and no one got this one right. Who led the Greeks in the battle of Thermoplylae? Anyone? Anyone? Seriously, guys, you've all seen the movie. Sherri, please validate my existence. King Leonidas. Yes. Thank you. There's hope for you yet. All right. Open your books to chapter 12. Maybe I can teach you a little something else you might remember. Yeah? Can I hit the bathroom? We're still on for tonight? Yeah. - Okay. - I'll catch you later. Okay. So what is this, some sort of joke? What the hell? Nice wheels, bro. Well, if you don't have any evidence that it was him, then I don't understand why're you at my doorstep, Officers? Why didn't you answer the doorwhen I knocked? I didn't hear. Quite the first day, huh? They found all your classmate's wheels in a dumpster behind the cafeteria. I don't know a thing about that. That was embarrassing, John. I swear, I thought you were smarter than this. Picking a fight with a kid, and then vandalizing his bike in the same day? That's not the civilized way to handle conflict. I guess I'm not civilized. Stop mumbling. Speak up if you have something to say. Pardon me, good sir, I guess I'm not civilized. That was the most intelligent thing you've said since you've arrived. I told you I shouldn't be here. Well, one thing's for certain. If those officers come back, you won't be. What do you think? Felony assault. Do you buy any of it? It's his word against theirs. That neighborhood, those white supremacist crews, they take care of their own. What's the matter, John? You're waiting to say grace or something? I was expecting collard greens. You get up in your seat and you do it now. You're embarrassed to be seen with my husband? MaryAnna... No, don't placate him, Eldridge. You are a fool if you judge people by the way they look. Now, get up. I'll sit here alldarnday if I have to. John, I want to let you know I packed your lunch myself today, okay? Vanilla pudding, bologna and cheese on white bread. I cut the crust off. Some sauerkraut. I even threw some crackers in there, okay? That's my son. Anybody know where I can sign up for the parent-teacher conference? - Stop. - Oh, sorry. Pretty good. Oh. History buff, huh? I read a lot. Hmm. So what they did to you for messing with their bikes? I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. God, I used to hate this spot. You used to sit here? Yeah, back when I was the new kid. It's... it's like the rite of passage for the kids who are out of place. I think you just called me a misfit. I don't know what you're talking about. So you're into science? Mainly I like to know how stuff works, you know, so I can improve on it. Like? Like polyurethane wheels, for example. Back in the day, skaters were cracking their skulls from clay and steel wheels. And then finally, we have a balance between abrasion and traction, and it's all from some synthetic resin. So you're officially a science geek? Would you like, keep it down please? I don't want to... you know, end up back at this spot. You're sitting here with me now. I'll catch you later, all right? Thanks for the apple. I drove around for an hour looking for you. Didn't answer your phone. The ringer was off. Well, if I were you, I'd get out of here before Eldridge gets home. All right, lights out. It's ten o'clock, you need to sleep. Listen, when I moved here from the south, I didn't know anybody. I was working three jobs just to get through school. I didn't have time to make friends. Really, it wasn't until I met MaryAnna that things just started falling into place. I still don't know what she was thinking. Why me? Why not a good kid? Everybody deserves a second chance. This one right here, is this a 20.5 inch top-tube? Yeah. Chromoly, right? Yeah. Why do we have to leave so freakin' early? Because I have a big meeting, that's why. And if you don't like it, you can get to school on your own. How? How? That's how. Now MaryAnna won't have to drive around all day looking for you after school. Well, what do you think? You're trying to buy me? It's pretty ironic. I'm not trying to buy you. I just thought you could use a little independence, that's all. How badly did you want a son of your own? I bet you're the one shooting blanks. You should have seen your face, all excited to give me a bike. You know what? I'm tired of this little tough boystuff. You want to act grown, let's be grown. I'm from the worst parts of Kentucky. I will wear your ass down right here, right now. You want to hit me, go ahead. I've been hit before. You know what? Do what you want. I don't even care. You gotta be kidding me. Why are we here? I saw you last night. I can teach you how to ride a bike, and I'll promise not to quit, if you don't. I don't want your help. Why? Because my skin has more melanin than yours? Melanin, pigmentation. I know what melanin is. It's not as hard as you think it is, okay? Once you get the hang of it, it becomes like second nature. Someone like you should take five minutes. Someone like me, what does that mean? It means you should have learned how to do this ten years ago. Now come on. Just do what I tell you, all right? Keep kicking, come on. A little faster. I feel dumb. You're a smart kid, you just act dumb. Now come on. I know you can do this. Okay, that's good. Okay, keep going. Now start to peddle. You can do it, trust me. Come on. Yeah, there you go. There you go... oh! I got you. There you go. Yeah. Thatg's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Like this. Fork, knife, spoon.

Whooh! All right, John! Hey. MaryAnna just told me about the skate park you want to hit up tomorrow. - Yeah. It looks pretty cool. Well, I'm down. Awesome. Hey, you want me to wear a mask or anything? Because I don't want to embarrass you. Yeah, a pillow case, and cut two holes out for your eyes? See, that was clever, tasteless, and offensive. Good night, John. Good night, eh... Eldridge. Yeah, so it's called the Magnus Effect. Okay. If the air pressure spins fast enough, they could power a 100,000 DWT cargo ship, and knock it entirely off its course. Nothing is set in stone, you hear me? Nothing. I hope that solves your dam problem. I know way more about this bike stuff than you think I do. Oh, yeah? Yes. Lookie, lookie here. John? Holy shit. Little man with the plan. We should go. - What do you mean? We just got here. Yeah, you just got here. You know, I knew you were lost, little brother, but this? I can't believe this. Come on, Rory, you don't want to do this. Shut up. Look, we don't want any trouble. We are trouble. And he used to be trouble. So why you're hanging out with one of our crew? Come on, Jack, let's roll. These fools aren't worth our time. What's wrong, Johnny boy? You ashamed of your family? Your dad bled for us, he bled for you, and now you're hanging out with a nigger? Excuse me? You heard him, coon. Jack, don't. - John, let's go. We're out of here. You're not going anywhere. No. What the hell do you think you're doing? Rory, stop! - Ah! - Help! Someone call 911! No, dammit. - No, man. - Whose side are you on, huh? No, man. 5-0, let's go. Eldridge! I don't know what to say. I told him we should go, to leave the park. You didn't hit him, John. It's just... it churns up things I'd rather forget. Eldridge was pulled over in Lexington, Kentucky one night after a match. He was accused of assaulting a white woman on a college campus nearby. So he didn't do it? No. He was innocent, but it was all over the papers. He was the first. Olympic qualifying wrestler from Kentucky. Some people didn't like that. He was wrongfully imprisoned until one of the witnesses finally came forward and identified the man who did it, months later. Eldridge was exonerated, but by then he... He'd lost his full scholarship. A black man assaulting a white woman in the south is about as bad as it gets in prison. Let's just say he experienced more physical pain than the human body can withstand. And then he got... He got sick in there. A seemingly benign tumor, but it affected his... His chances of ever producing children. You know, we looked at hundreds... hundreds of files of kids. And he chose yours... Because of the reason behind what you did. I was trying to help my mom. He saw kindness behind that hard exterior. He also saw a survivor. Eldridge fought his way back, John. So can you. Dillan, Dillan, Dillan, where do I start with you? You got a long way to go, kid. You'll get there. We're an endangered species, boys. It's the problem with blacks. They take what's not theirs, they got no morals. They're animals, really. Yeah, like that black yesterday. Like the one that put that on your face? - Put what on my face? - Ah, he beat your ass. Yeah, he did. - He blindsided me, man. - You know what, Dillan? This is what not to do, right here. Oh yeah, what not to do, Oakland. Jack... Jack, you stupid son of a bitch. Shut up! Some kid's stealing your shit. - Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Shit! Get in the car! Go, go, go! Get him! There he is! There he is! There he is! We're going to kick your ass! Where you gonna go now, John? - Hey, Sebastian. - Huh? Twenty bucks you can't 180 the stairs. Twenty bucks to kill myself? No. All right, 50 bucks so you can kill yourself. I'll do it for a 100. All right, deal. I'll do it for 200. Well he's already doing it for half that, so... No, he's not. He's scared. No, I'll do it, but I'd much rather see you crack your skull for 200. I'm in. Okay. You want to do it for 200? You got to do it with a 360. Yo, what's going on? New kid's going to break his neck for 200 bucks. Just seeing him wipe out's worth way more than 200 bucks, man. You guys are sick. Come on, John. Take their money. All right, come on, poseurs, buck up. Yo, respect, man. Yeah, where the hell did you learn that? First time. That's bullshit. No, man. I've seen it done. Knew I could do it too. Whatever. Yo, man, you got to start riding with us. Yeah. Move. - So what'd you think? - I see you. The Aryan brothers felt badly about what happened, so they gave the bike back out of the goodness of their hearts. So John stole it back. Yep. Good. Sort of reminds me of someone. It's from John. For what? - He didn't say. I didn't ask. Well, where is he? In his room. I think he was afraid to watch you open it. Hmm. Stand up, John. What for? Just stand up. Scooch. You really owe me. For what? You don't know? Check it. Whoa. Yeah, you see that? That's huge. That is Scott Carroll. He's the MVP of BMX. You're welcome. All right, good. Do it again, drop your height. You got to pump harder, you need more air. Yo, yo! Hey, hey! - What's up, Sherri? - Scott. - How are you? - Good. And you must be "Raising Hell"? What? I saw your video, man. Nice 360. Oh. Yo, yo, what's he doing here? Relax. I invited him. - Oh, okay. That makes sense. For one trick, huh? It was all right. He's gotta have more than a 360, man. J's right. You think you got in you to do a big boy variation? - Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, totally. Okay. John, take a lap. - Sure thing. - Whoa, whoa, wait. Put this on. Oh, yeah, don't go in that corner over there, there's the OG's, all right? They don't mess around. I got it. In about five minutes, you're going to be thanking me. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure I am. Hoo-hoo. That was nice. - It's pretty good, kid. - Yeah? You got some talent. Thanks. Train with us, we'll see what happens. Okay. Yeah. Good job. You were hot. - That was awesome. - You killed it. ♪ Okay ♪ You roll your eyes ♪ A hundred times ♪ At every phony lie ♪ Are your eyes okay? ♪ They rolled away ♪ Right down the interstate ♪ But at least You can't cry today ♪ ♪ Okay ♪ So if I break my face ♪ And I don't look so great ♪ My face is just my face ♪ 'Cause everything Is going great ♪ ♪ So if I break my face ♪ It ain't my darkest day ♪ My face is just my face ♪ I'm okay Whoo hoo-hoo!

All right, guys, listen up. This year, Etnies Shoes is sponsoring the Lucas Oil BMX nationals. It's going to be a really, really big deal, but I can only take five of you. So today is your day to show if you deserve to be one of those five. Who wants to show their stuff to thousands of people on national television? All right, make me proud. Don't screw up. Just feed your kids. Ah, they're screw ups anyway. They had a good example for that. What did you say? Let's go, guys. Everybody gets one run. Show me your best. Whoa! Oh! You okay? Yeah. Good. Who's next? Alright, come on. Hey, tough break. Leave me alone. Did you think it was going to be easy? Yeah. Because that's the way it works for me. I get all the breaks. So what, you didn't make the traveling team. I'm never going to be anything. Just like my father, and nothing's going to change that. - Wait a second. - These are shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. They're just fantasy, that's all they are. Listen, listen, wait a second. This is my favorite. I love this man. You know what? Come with me. I know exactly where to hang this. Look, you've been with us almost ten months. I've never asked anything from you. Chores. Well, that I wasn't asking. Come on. Another inspiring life lesson today? What the hell is he doing here? I asked him to come. I'm not here to cause trouble, little man. You kept this? Yeah, the bank took the house after mom passed away. That was all I could grab. Felony assault. Prints came back on the knife, his. Where's dad? Prison. He's not getting out. Why did you lie to the police? Rory. Rory! Just ask my brother or my mom, okay? They'll clear it all up. We did. They told us you're a danger to yourself and the family. But... Mom asked me to, to protect you from dad. No! So Mom made you lie to get me out of there? Yes. The court ordered us to have no contact with you. It was... was part of the arrangement. Come on, what do you say? Can we hit the reset button? And what about your boys, huh? Hey, don't worry about them. I've been watching you down at the park. You... you got some good moves. Not good enough. They cut me, I'm a non-starter.

Slow your pedal, "Raising Hell".Come here. Why didn't you do that last time? So the team's staying overnight by the skate park so we could practice just before the tournament. We're each allowed to bring one person. If it's cool with you, I was hoping I could bring Sherri? I already asked her parents and they're cool with it. - Yeah. Sure, whatever you think. Yeah, they said no uncool parents allowed, so. I'm just kidding. I want it to be you... You to be with me. Better have been me. You should've seen your face. I was going to have Sherri murdered. Goddammit. Where's Rory? Where's he at? I don't know, man. I've called him, I've texted him all day. He's not answering me. Well, we can't do it without him. The kid can drive. We need two lookouts, Paul. We need two of them. What do want me to do? You're having a good time? - Hmm-mm. - Yeah, good. Can I get you anything? A cigarette? Or... or a beer? It'll be my pleasure. Yeah. Pull up. Get the stuff now. Hold up. Georgie says your golden boy's with his little brother. And the monkey. So the brake line runs this little hook. If you squeeze it, you just... - All right. - Yeah. Put the wheel on, you take this and then you gottaline up the brake pads. So... Almost there. You level it with the wheel, right? And tighten. Nice. That's it? Yup. That does it. I gotta get going, little brother. All right. Rory? See you at the tournament, right? Yeah, I wouldn't miss it. I don't like this any more than you do, but we all saw this coming. He's a race traitor. This is what he deserves. - Uh, no. You don't need this. Okay. I'm going to getthe snacks before I forget them. Look, now this, this is good. This is, this is like a Monet. No way. That's so bad. That's messed up, man. I have feelings too, you know? Come on, race traitor. You're dead, Rory. MaryAnna, call 911. Stay here. - Come on! Come on, race traitor! Get the hell back! Get back! Back up! - Get! - Hey! - Get back! - Get in the car! You're dead, Johnny boy. Stay up. Stay up. Stay up. Rory? You're gonna be all right. I don't think I'll be flying with you anytime soon, little bro. You know, you saved us. I wish it was me. This whole thing you got going, I wish it was me. I wish all of it was me. I wish I got sent away instead of you. You've no idea how hard it was inside that house without you, man. You were my only sanity. Family. I can't leave you. There'll be another competition next year. - It's no big deal. - No. No way, man. Listen to me. You go and you show those punks the McCord family can't be stopped. Okay? You got two families to make proud. I'm gonna tell the cops everything. All the stuff we did.

Gather up. - Scott... - Thank you for coming. - How are you? - Hello, Scott. Team, this is Forest and Charlotte Lucas. They sponsor one team every year in this tournament and this year, they chose us. I'm glad to have all you boys with us this year. We won't let you down, will we? No! No, sir. Go give 'em hell, guys. Scott? Yeah? Can your guys do this? You know, you really got your work cut out for you. These guys are, these guys are good. I'll take care of it. All right, guys! Listen up! Come in! Come in!

He doesn't know what he's got without it. Where are we going? Try somewhere new. Mr. Buultjens? Yes. Right this way. Here you go. Surprise. Let me know if you need anything else. Congratulations. On what? Well... these are your official adoption papers. I know we're supposed to wait a year, but I pulled a few strings and I think you guys are ready. Eldridge and MaryAnna have already signed. What? So no matter what happens, John, from here on out, good and bad, we want you as our son. That is, if you'll have us. My stomach's touching my back. Can we order some food please? Hello, everybody! Welcome to Lucas Oil BMX Nationals presented by Etnies. I'm your host, Mike Escamilla, and we have the best bike riders in the world battling it out for a ton of cash, and most of all, a ton of respect. Daniel Sandoval, Dennis Enarson, Kris Fox, Mike Parenti, and many others will go toe-to-toe with last year's champion, Larry Edgar. Yeah. I did it last year, so I'm just gonna do it again this year. I'm gonna introduce you to our legendary cast of judges. Down the end, I have "X Man" Xavier. I got Mike "The Flame" Dominguez, king of all skate park king. I've got Bryan Blyther, inventor of style. Ron Wilkerson, the inventor of the mythical. And down the end, the man, the myth, the legend, Mat "The Condor" Hoffman. Judges will be looking for not just what these guys are doing, but how they ride as a whole. We judge how you ride the course, style, tricks, everything comes into play. By Jason Watts. Don't see that very often. Let's see how the judges score that. Judges give him 87. Larry Edgar kicking it off a can-can. Mike Parenti with a huge flip transfer over the head. Let's see what the judges are gonna score him. Parenti coming in with an 88 for his first run. My boy! Come on, bro. Next is newcomer, John McCord, of Scott Carroll's team. Getting technical right from the start with a tail nose pick. Look at that one-hander. Can he twist it all the way to 70? Ending it with a 450 truck-driver. This kid has got some moves. Let's see what the judges give him. John McCord with an 89! That's an incredible score for a newcomer. Let's see if he can keep that momentum in the bowl. Larry, what do you think John McCord's real chances are? - John who? I think it's beginner's luck. Just because the riders are doing tricks doesn't mean they're gonna win. Not too tight. I really need you to stop moving, okay? The way they use the bowl is what matters most. Stay still. Last year's champ, Larry Edgar, dropping in. But the bowl is really where he calls home. - Boom! Nobody does tables like that. Look at that style! So sick! Everything he does has so much power. Right into a big no-hander into the bank. Wow! That score is going to be hard to beat. Edgar just scored a 94! All right. Let's see what the newcomer's got. ♪ Just watch! ♪ Yeah! Just watch! ♪ Just watch ♪ I got this ♪ Just watch ♪ Hey stop this ♪ Just watch John, the new kid, might have this. I think, he could take this to the end. ♪ Yeah just watch ♪ I got this Just watch ♪ Oh the massive 540... Hey! John's got time for one more trick. What's he got? Going for the 720. ♪ Yeah just watch John goes down. Medics are over with John now. Let's hope he's okay. Do you have any neck pain? - No. - Any back pain? No. - Shoulder? - Don't touch it! Yes. Okay. Ready to set him up? Ready? One, two, three! You okay, kid? All right, come on. Well, John going down opens up a huge opportunity for some of the other riders. This is gonna be a close call now with this crash. I think Edgar has a shot. Can you roll your shoulder? I can't. Dislocated. We're gonna have to take him to the ER. The results are in. We have a tie! Larry Edgar and the newcomer, John McCord, have tied. That's never happened before. I can't believe that. This means we're gonna have to go to sudden death, if John can ride. If he can't, Larry will be our winner. We're going to have to DQ. - Come on. - No, no. Wait. I can set it. They'll take care of that in the ER. - No. - No. He could do it. Let him do it. I wrestled for 15 years. Just buy me five minutes. That's all I need. I'll get you your five minutes. Hey, I need your help. Come with me. This is gonna be painful. Pain never stopped us. - All right. On three, all right? Okay. One... We're down to the top two riders. Even with John McCord's wipeout, he still tied with Larry Edgar for first place. They're going to go head to head on the big rim. All right, Edgar's dropping in. Let's see what he's got. Big corked out backflip. No one does it with such style as Edgar. That is something you cannot learn. You have that kind of style or you don't. John at the top of the roll-in. Coming off that shoulder, let's see how it affects his trick. All right. Here we go. My life wasn't always like this. The choices I made led me closer to the edge. But those choices, they led me to something I never thought could be real. And now I know better. John, when things get tough, remember that they told me I'd never have a son, but now I have you. Come on, John! Come on! Come on, John! A huge double barrel suicide backflip. Oh, my gosh! I don't know if that's ever been done before. - That's right, John! That's right! That's my baby brother. And the judges are unanimous. John McCord is the winner of the Lucas Oil BMX Nationals! - Ha-ha. You did it, John! My mom lived with fear her whole life. Now, she rests in peace. I let her know I overcame the fear for both of us. Thank you, Mom, for loving me enough to let me go.
