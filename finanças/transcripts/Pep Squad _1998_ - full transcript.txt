[BIRDS CHIRPING] [TIRES SCREECH] [ENGINE WHIRRING] [SCREECH] [MUSIC PLAYING] The yearbooks are here! [SCREAMING] Get out of my way! 5, 20, 50. I have 50. So do I. 50 pictures. That's my elbow. I have 51. No you don't. Yes, I do. [DRUMS PLAYING] Cherry! Will you sign by book? Drop dead. [DRUMS PLAYING] Beth. Wake up. Oh, mom, no. Don't you mom me. Get up, now. Lay there any longer and your butt'll get bigger. Mom, I have three more minutes. I set my alarm for a reason. You do this to me every morning. Dear. Maybe you should go to bed earlier. Mom, god. For Christ's sakes, just leave. Look at this mess. I thought I told you to clean this room. Yes. I distinctly remember. Chop chop. Get up. No time to lay about. You miss the bus, your father and I are gonna have to drop you off. And we have no time! Where's my broom? I just had it. Carl. Carl! It's right there in front of your face. Ha. That's funny. Bethany, sweetheart. I can't keep taking your laundry to the cleaners before lunch. You need to get a job. I can't go to school and do everything, mom. I can't support you forever, Beth. I have my own life to worry about. [SCREECHING] Your mother and I have decided-- BARBARA: We haven't decided anything. CARL: We're getting a divorce. More like a separation. CARL: I just bought a new house. We're getting a divorce. BARBARA: Nothing's been signed yet. Oh, it will be. [TIRES SCREECH] [BELL RINGING] MR. WILSON: Beth. You're late again. Of course I am. MR. WILSON: I'll have to notify Principal Anderson. LATAQWA: Scott. Will you sign my book? LaTaqwa, I told you to put that book away. What's the point in having a yearbook anyway? TEACHER: This is a class, people, not a social club. Don't ever question authority. What do you suggest we do when the authority's being a jerk? Ms. Thurman. Would you like to go to Principal Anderson's office? Not really. LATAQWA: Hey, suicide chick. That's the one. Out of all these pictures, I can tell, just by looking at the eyes. That's the one that's gonna die. [THUNDER BOOMING] [MUSIC PLAYING] God, I hate pep rallies, don't you? Least we get out of class. [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you deaf or completely stupid? You are a freshman, an idiot, a god damned paperback, and this is the senior bench. Get it? And that is my seat. I didn't know. Bullshit, zit face. I told you twice last week, and I am sick of it. Every week, this shit happens. My books over here and my books over there. Um, hi, Kelly. My name's Tommy. Julie. Do you think Scott's gonna tell us the prom queen candidates today? Julie. Do you think Scott's gonna tell us the-- Tara. Leave me alone. God, I wonder. Do you know who they picked? Not you, scare-a Terra. (SQUEAKING) Not you, scare-a Terra. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] So what's your name? I'm doing a story for the paper. Would you like to be in it? Oh, I don't really-- It's about role models. OK. I admit. The only reason I come to school is to write shit about people. But I find you intriguing. I mean it. MR. ANDERSON: The time has come, my students, to decide which eight lucky girls best represent Oak Hill High. To announce the final prom queen candidates, it's my pleasure and honor to introduce your student council president, Mr. Scott Mendota. Who cares? Scott. OK. After I call out the list of girls, if you could please come up here and stand in line so everybody can see you. Wanda Clark. [SCREAM] SCOTT: Thelma Melvins. Yes! SCOTT: Terra Simpson. Yes! SCOTT: Julie Thurmond. Penelope Marshal. Oh my god! SCOTT: Laurie Kline. Oh god! SCOTT: Polly Wilson. Ha! I knew it! BETH (VOICEOVER): I can't believe this is actually happening. And. [GASP] Debbie Johnson. [APPLAUSE] For these eight girls, a dream has become a reality. [ROARING] [MUSIC PLAYING] You all think you are so great. Well, you are wrong. All of you. [DRUMS PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] One down, seven to go. BARBARA: I don't think I want you going to that school. Mom, nothing's going to happen to me. Kids getting hit by cars. That could've been you. I don't wanna turn on the news and find out my daughter's dead. Carl. I thought I told you to balance my checkbook. Beth. I think we ought to send you to a private school. Mom. Dad, tell her she's-- CARL: I don't have to organize your life, Barbara. We're not married anymore. I think Bethany would love a private school. We have reservations. Violet, party for three. I'm sorry. You're dressed entirely too casual. We don't allow sneakers. We phoned ahead. The man said jackets were optional. Carl. I'm sorry. Carl, you said it was optional. She obviously doesn't need our business. [SCREECHING] Beth. Beth. Aren't you that girl from Mr. Wilson's class? Did you eat at Tradewinds? Uh-uh. Were those your parents? Ah-huh. Look. Why don't you eat with us? [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, darling. What can I get for you? Um, water. Thanks. The usual? SCOTT: Yeah. Yes. I don't know what to get. You'll have the same. Bring her the same. SCOTT: Is it Friday yet? No, honey. It's Thursday. SCOTT: Great. I'm so goddamn tired of school. Shit has got to change, or I swear. By graduation, I will go fucking insane. Oh, did you hear? Thelma Melvins got hit by a car. Perfect. Now I have to find somebody to replace her. Scott. Why don't you quit student council? It takes up much too much of your time. And why don't you quit the paper, Julie? Because, it's the only way I can get them to listen, so I can tell them exactly what I think. OK. See? Same goes for me. That fucking school is so goddamn hard to please. My first day on the paper, they said if I wasn't part of the solution, I was part of the problem. But their solutions suck, so I tried to change things, and now I am the problem. Well, we've got to do something. What? Drop out of school? I don't know. Complain? Who's listening? Ethel the lunchlady? Fat chance. Hey thanks for the ride, guys. I'm really glad that I met you. See you tomorrow? Sure. All right, bye bye. Bye. Oh my god. Look at her. She is such a sweetie, you know? I can't believe that her parents would do that to. SCOTT: Her parents probably beat her. JULIE: Oh, Scott. Don't. I think she actually enjoyed hanging out with us. SCOTT: You can't prove that. CHERRY: You won't get away with this. I swear to God. You will never get crowned. I am prom queen. OFFICER: Investigating a hit and run. Her name was Thelma Melvins. Someone said she was a prom queen candidate. And your friend. That's awful, officer. She was such a good friend. And besides, she won best dressed in the yearbook this year. [SOBBING] Thanks again for the ride. Not a problem. God. This place is so inflated. Don't freak. Lunch is just around the corner. [BELL RINGING] But because someone got 100%, there won't be a curve. Who was it? Who got the 100? Beth Violet. Principal Anderson wants a talk with you. Cherry. The principal wants to see you too. Of course he does. Look at me. Right now, young lady! (DEMONIC) Get out of my face! Make it shine, Boy. You don't ever step on the Oak Hill Indian. Now, I want to see your ugly reflection. I didn't step on it, Mr. Anderson. Honest. They pushed me. Tommy. Yes, sir. You come to my office. Make sure he gets that red face polished. Hi. [PHONE RINGING] What are you in here for? Kill somebody, huh? Oh, really? Well, that's interesting. Must have been horrible. Not very talkative this morning? Well, I understand. Neither am I. No you don't. You have no idea what it's like being here every day. There's no reason to say anything anymore. No one listens, no one cares. I open my mouth and nothing comes out. And what's the point? Nothing's gonna change. Everything is gonna be the same, every day, for the rest of our lives. You know, you can change things if you really want to. [DOOR OPENS] [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, Beth, unexcused tardies are immature. They're responsible. You called me in here because I have a few tardies? Not just a few. Mr. Wilson reported you late 11 times. Now, you'll have out of school suspension if this continues. What? Out of school suspension? Don't you think that's a bit extreme? Don't question the rules of my institution, Ms. Violet. These regulations aren't new. Any moron could get to class on time. Do you realize that not going to class was the original idea? Are you smoking crack in the teacher's lounge or what, Mr. Anderson? Watch your mouth, or I'll hold you back another year. Don't threaten me. I've had it up to my elbows with this shit. Take it out. What? You think you're god, don't you? You are a sick fucking freak. You're just a principal. It's like you never graduated high school. You're still here. The problem here is authority. What we need is a role model. We need some help, because I'm not gonna take this anymore. Let go of me, you ugly bitch! Sit down! Jesus. When are you gonna get some guts and do it, suicide chicken? Oh, that look was really pretty. Why don't you write another goddamn suicide letter? Like anyone'll give a shit. [ALARM RINGING] Mr. Anderson! Mr. Anderson! He left a minute ago and he hasn't come back yet. Come on. Quick. We gotta go before the fire gets here. BETH: Julie. Julie. I need your help. I didn't know who else to tell, and, well, you're the only friends I have. You won't believe-- believe it. I-- I've done something. Come on. I can't believe it. What are we gonna do with him? We? We had nothing to do with this. Shut up, Scott. Do something important for once in your life. Important? Going to college is important. What are the chances of graduating after this? Forget it. Be quiet. Go to the janitor's room, get the trash bin, and load him in. Go! [MUSIC PLAYING] Um, honey. I think Beth has some serious issues. You liked her first. JULIE: Slow down. SCOTT: When do you think they'll notice he's gone? JULIE: This is no time for thinking. BETH: Don't panic, all right? SCOTT: You don't panic. It's all your fault. BETH: All right, all right. It's my fault. JULIE: Stop it. We are in this together, OK? Let's go to lunch. SCOTT: At a time like this? JULIE: Food relaxes me. BETH: Let's wash the car. SCOTT: Forget it. That's the first place they'll look. Criminals always go to the car wash first. JULIE: We've just kidnapped the principal. I wonder how much detention we'll get for that. [ENGINE WHIRRING] What is she doing? Is she retarded? [MUMBLING SHOUTING] ANDERSON: Oh, Jesus. JULIE: Shut up. Nobody can hear you. See what you made us do? SCOTT: We can't keep him here forever. JULIE: My parents will not be back 'til Monday. ANDERSON: Monday? BETH: Well, aren't you having a party tonight? JULIE: Ah, fuck. I forgot. God damn track team. BETH: Well, cancel it. SCOTT: We can't. JULIE: Told too many people. [MUFFLED SHOUTING] What is happening? I can't believe this mess. Shut up, Scott. I'm thinking. This is what we were talking about, right? Shit has to change, remember? Well, we're changing things. I really don't think this is what you meant. Why don't we take advantage of the situation instead of freaking out? Why don't we just let him go? Are you insane? They'd arrest us before we even got back to school. Oh, shit. His car. I can't find them. Dig deeper. Bet it's been awhile since a real woman had her hand in your pants. Just as I thought. There's nothing downstairs. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Do you think it's safe there? He'll be fine until my parents get home. Besides, no one will see it. Well, what do we do with him? I don't know. I just-- I don't know. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, sexy. Don't. I need something stronger. Hey, Beth. Can I get your email number. No, Kim. Excuse me. -Fine. No love lost here, bitch. Everything OK? Who were you talking to? Doesn't matter. It's just sad when you think you have something and you really don't have anything at all. Excuse me. Is that your butt in my face. I don't know. Is that your face? Who invited you? Holly and Karen. Why don't you go bother them? Because. I must talk to you. I saw you at school the other day, and I know-- Neat. You'll probably see us there again. What's her story? She's the most absurd girl on Earth. [TOILET FLUSHING] [MOANING AND SCREAMING] What? There's someone upstairs. SCOTT: Can I help you? Um, I was looking for the bathroom. In the dark? It's downstairs. Oh. Heavens to Betsy. If it isn't prom queen opponent number two and Mr. Stud Body President? This just isn't fair at all. Gee, Wanda. You're cheating, Terra. Oh, Scotty. What would Julie say if she knew you were screwing all the candidates? Wanda. Have a beer and drive yourself home. Problems with Scare-a? Not yet. Hello, Helen? Would you be a peach and connect me with the police? What? Party is over. They need to go home. SCOTT: OK, dumb ass. What if the operator tells the cops to come look around. They'll find him. No, they won't. Relax. Who the hell would wanna drive all the way out here? Go outside and finish the party. Where are you going? I'll be right back. [LAUGHTER] The fallout shelter. Woo. SCOTT: And the tardy policy has to go. It's retarded. Its like when you tell a little kid not to take the cookie. The first thing he's gonna do is take the cookie. BETH: What? Forget it. I'm the principal. Don't you think they'll notice I'm gone? JULIE: Probably. SCOTT: But that's our problem. You're right, Mr. Mendota. It is your problem. You kids think you're popular you're gonna get away with this? I'm gonna send you to jail for the rest of your pathetic little lives. BETH: Shut up. You try and call the cops, and I'll sue your punk ass for sexual harassment. Try it, bitch. You think a jury will believe a 17-year-old kidnapper? BETH: I'm 18, you son of a bitch. SCOTT: Of course they will. Look at you. You look like a child molester. JULIE: There is no point in arguing. We are calling the shots. Now eat your breakfast. We might be back with some milk. Crazy freaks. I'm gonna kill your dogs. I'm gonna chew your throats out. You're finished! Julie. Can I have a smoke? Sure. Hey, what are we gonna do with him when your parents get home? Ugh. Why does everybody always think that I have all the answers? Because you usually do. Um, Julie. Oh. I thought it might come in handy. What the fuck? I mean, come on. Let's not stop here. I agree it's a little more time consuming than homework, but I think we can make a difference. I'm gonna go upstairs and shower. Come on, Beth [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, where'd you guys put my clothes? [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENING] I got the bottles. Hello? Yes. It's true. I've got the bottles. Oh my god. You're alive. Is this some sort of sick joke? Is the whole senior class in on it? Are you high? I didn't have anything to do with this. Ms. Simpson. You'll have to let me go. Otherwise, I'll throw your ass into jail with the rest of them. You will not. Young lady. I've been tied up for days. My circulation is cut off. My arms, if they don't work, then we're gonna have to amputate. Could you just loosen the rope so I could at least move around? I don't think I should do that. Please. They tortured me. OK. Oh my god. Julie! I told you I'd get loose, and I meant it. You're finished. Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker. I know you won't do it, you stupid bitch. You don't have the guts. You never did. Shut your face and get your ugly ass back downstairs. I'm calling the police. [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC - "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL"] [ROOSTER CROWING] That wasn't very smart. SCOTT: How the fuck did you get in here? I broke in. Um, we just killed the principal. No, I didn't. I didn't kill him. Yeah, you did. Oh my god. Get him inside. Oh my god. SCOTT: We need to find a bag or something to put him in. Oh my god. Come on, Julie. Let's go get you a drink. Need some help, Scott? Terra, you've helped us plenty. What do you want? I won't tell anyone, unless you-- Unless what? Unless you piss me off. I wanna be prom queen. You're in charge of that, right? Terra. It's not that easy. Oh, you'll do it, or I'll call the police. I'll be in touch. Have a nice day. I might as well die. I killed the principal. Now I'll never graduate. We have to get rid of the body. How? Throw him in the river? What happens when they find him? We're gonna get the electric chair. I know it. Make it look like an accident. She shot him in the back. It looks like murder to me. Murder? I don't know. But we can do anything. Right, Julie? I'm a murderer? We-- we need some help. I need help. SCOTT: Who? Terra? Well, why not? She knows everything anyway. Besides, if we don't ask her, she might feel left out and call the police. She wouldn't do that. Winning prom queen is more important to her than whether we go to jail. We should call a professional. -Oh. OK, Scott. Wake up. This doesn't happen every day. Who on Earth can we call? I guarantee you, no one's ever done this before. Well, if we hadn't somebody else would've. Oh, who? [SIRENS BLARING] [MUSIC PLAYING] I know, stupid. I was there. Cherry, please. We're in trouble. You were the only person we knew to call. How unfortunate for you. What do you want? Money? I have plenty already. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ugh! [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll do it because I hate him and he's ugly. I'm the only person who doesn't give a damn. Besides, the son of a bitch gave me detention for kicking him in the face. What are you going to do? Don't worry about. I'll be over at midnight to pick him up. I'll need someone to follow me in his car. I'll-- I'll do it. Great. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here. Well, aren't you gonna help me carry him outside? Why do you need any help? I was just kidding. Christ. I can get him to do anything for me. Um, Julie. What we're going to do Monday morning? What do you mean what are we going to do? Well, should we go to school separately? Why? We didn't do anything. Nothing happened this weekend. We're just three friends going to school. Don't freak. They won't think anything unless we give them reason to, OK? OK. It's just, you know, I feel like I started this whole mess, and now I have nothing to do with it. Beth, you're totally a part of it. We're helping you because we are your friends. You don't even know me. I am not as stupid as Scott looks. Get the body in the car and hurry up. I've got a geometry test tomorrow. It's in the garage. Congratulations. [DOOR SLAM] What now? Wipe your fingerprints off everything you've touched. [MUSIC - "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL"] Souvenir? You know. He tripped on a log. I know what you're thinking. I'm not insane. I'm an artist. [EXPLOSION] [CRANKING] JULIE: You don't think she really did it, do you? SCOTT: Who? JULIE: Suicide chick. She's gone. That's horrible. MR. WILSON: Mr. Mendota. Silence yourself. Did suicide chick really kill herself? Get to work. [KNOCKING] Come in. Today, class, Officer Butler's going to explain the various types of illegal drugs. Please give her your complete attention. Take a bite out of crack. LaTaqwa, settle down. Officer Butler. Do you wanna sign my yearbook? Sure. [KNOCKING] Excuse me, Mr. Wilson. I was wondering if I could speak with Ms. Violet. Beth. Cross your fingers, honey. Better yet, cross your legs. JULIE: Cross your mama's legs. Oh god. My goodness. Bethany, dear. Sweetheart. You didn't call. I thought you'd run away from home. I didn't know what to think. Where were you? What are you doing? I thought you were dead, run over like that other girl. Mom. I stayed at my friend Julie's. Relax. I was home late last night, and if you'd have bothered to check on me, you would have found me in my room this morning. Your mother's on medication. She doesn't know what she's saying. Ugh. Don't give me that crap. [PHONE RINGING] Bethany! Not here. Excuse me, Ms. Violet. TOGETHER: Yes? Beth. The newspaper man is here for the senior class photo. The students are being sent to the senior bench. Thanks, Ms. Watson. She never talks to me. I wanna know what's going on in her life. Why won't she talk to me? You know. Teenagers. Don't seem to know this one. OK. OK, guys. Excuse me. Hello! Thank you. All right. Uh, tss, tss, tss. I need you through you on the first row. Everyone else, make rows behind them. Is everybody ready? [SCREAM] [CROWD GASPS] Who did this to me, huh? Who? Ma'am. Ma'am. GIRL: Somebody get the principal. Quiet, you fat bitch. He's dead! This was stuffed up my tailpipe. I was just in the hospital for inhaling gas. The kind of gas that kills. You. Me? You did this to me, didn't you? You stupid, goddamn, lice-infected bitch! You're just jealous because I was nominated for prom queen and you weren't. You're nothing but a spoiled, rotten, two-faced bitch who thinks she's superior to everyone. I am superior to everyone, especially you and your fucked up, yeast-infected, moldy face. At least my father doesn't teach piano lessons at the Catholic church. Cherry. Your father is a fucking gynecologist. You think that looking up cunts all day is any better? Scare-a Terra! Strawberry shortcake. I challenge you to a fight. I dare you. Prom night. If you're not there, I will ruin you. You are no match for me, you fucking bitch! Get the car. It's true! He's dead! Principal Anderson, at, last, is dead! [CHEERING] Yoo hoo! Julie. Wait. Ugh! What? What is it, Terra? I have to go. Why were you at the laundromat with Cherry on Saturday? Terra. Take a pill. Don't play dumb. I was there! That's when I put the banana up her tail pipe. I knew she was following me. I had to stop her. Did she find out? Did you tell her? How did she know that Lester was dead? She guessed. We didn't tell her anything. There's something going on. What do you do over there? Does Scott sodomize you? That's why you won't hang out with me. If I find out that she's helping you, I swear to God I will call the police and report more than a gunshot. Ugh. [TIRES SCREECHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (EUROPEAN ACCENT) There are bombs in six classrooms. They will go off in two minutes. We will not say which rooms. Some students will live, some will die. This is not a joke. This is a warning. (AMERICAN ACCENT) One. Two. Three. [SCREAMING] Bitch! You wanna play? I can play. Fine. But I'm gonna win. BETH: It's like she wants to live through me. She wants to make me what she never was. and my dad, he just wants me to be the best so people will think he's the best. Like I'm supposed to make up for their fucked up lives. Beth. It's not your fault. Your parents are just going through some shit right now. Well, yeah, so am I. And when I'm having a totally cool dream and she fucking wakes me up right before my alarm clock goes off. The first thing I see is her face, and it just makes me hate her even more. You know, there's a lot of dumb shits in the world. The older you get, the more you find. No kidding. Grandpa told me that right before he died. I should've paid more attention to him. He's really smart. Yeah. I guess I just needed to say it out loud. And now I don't feel so bad about it. I mean, fuck it. If they wanna get divorced, it's their own goddamn problem. Exactly. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. Yeah, fuck 'em all. Fuck 'em. What can I do you for, babe? I've brought in my best CDs and I want a gun. Hey! You've looked long enough. Better get what you want and get going. Fucking niggers. What did you say? I'll give you 50 bucks. Bullshit. I want a gun, and you're going to give me one in exchange for these. How old are you? Get me a gun. Think you're such a good idea, lady. Give me the god damned gun. Get me a bigger one. That's all I got. I know you have a private room in the back. Let me see it. I'm willing to pay a little extra. How much extra? That' the one. Now, why would a pretty girl like you need a gun? [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] [HONKING] Hey, did you hear? Cherry ran over Wanda Clark yesterday. What? No way. Oh, she is out of control. Your mama's out of control. Can we stop for some pop? I need some sugar. You're in a good mood today. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] You've got to be kidding. We better go get some coffee before class. What do you think? I just woke up 25 minutes ago. I'm a little disturbed. Today, students arrived at Oak Hill High were put in a dreadful predicament. Here with me now is Terra Simpson, fellow prom queen candidate. Terra. Tell us. What are you feeling through these troubled times? TERRA (ON TV): I feel like I'm in danger. No one's protecting us. Penelope Marshall just got shot. That only leaves give candidates. Now prom won't ever be the same. KAREN (ON TV): Were you present when the shooter drove by? I was! Yes. It was awful. I thought I was gonna be next. I couldn't believe it was happening. I'm so lucky. It could have been me. What actions should be taken to increase gun control with minors? I think it's pretty easy these days to get a gun, and I think the state should enforce laws to enforce the sale of guns-- Fucking bitch! But not to the point that it invades a student's privacy. Thank you, girls, for talking to us this morning. Four months ago, the school board speculated that Principal Anderson was having sexual relations with a 16-year-old girls in several major cities across the country. Today, his replacement will be announced at the pep rally. Did you hear that? We have a new principal? His replacement? I'm going to the car for a smoke. Who's coming? We'll be bringing you updates throughout the day. This is Karen Jackson with KSOH TV. They're gonna find out. They will. -No, they won't. Terra. Shut up. We took care of everything. We're gonna be fine. Are you sure? You're not starting to doubt us, are you, Beth? They'll discover something. They always do. His death was accidental. They're making a big deal about it because he was fucking 16-year-olds. They are not looking for murderers. Well, what about Cherry? If they get her, she might tell them everything. What do you mean tell them everything? She might be a problem. She wouldn't say anything. Oh, really, Scott? She's a killer. Do I have something else to worry about now? No. Do I have something to worry about? It makes perfect sense. Huh? You're conspiring against us, aren't you? You and Cherry are gonna go tell them everything so you can get off the fucking hook. Lies! Lies and deception! -Oh, Terra, shut up! I knew she was helping you! You shut up. -Shut up! -Shut up. Shut up. SCOTT: I didn't do anything to begin with. It's all her fault. Fuck you. I didn't force you into this, Scott. Fuck you. You were a pussy from the beginning. Julie. Don't do this. Fuck him. Just, fuck him. He's not fucking around with Cherry, OK? That's not the point. Well, what is your point? He just aggravates me. I mean, I'm worried that he might turn us in. I mean, honestly, Beth. You were the one who kidnapped him. I shot him. What did he do? Nothing. Just complained. I mean, what if, you know? What if? Ready? TOGETHER: OK! El Camino. El-- El Camino. The front is like a car, and the back is like a truck. El Camino. El-- El Camino. The front is where we kissed and the back is where we-- El Camino. El-- El Camino. Nice job girls But let's see it one more time. TOGETHER: OK! El Camino. El-- El Camino. The front is like a car and the back is like a truck. El Camino. El-- El Camino. Well, excuse me for living. Debbie, Put yourself out of my misery. Someone's ragging big time. You call that a cheer? How do you expect us to win anything? Any games? You have no spirit. A dead body has more spirit than you. [WHISTLE BLOWING] Line up. This is a private practice for the pep rally, so anyone not on the team, please leave. Hey, Cherry. You want a drink? Are you retarded? Get your drunk, anorexic ass over to the bleachers and sit down. Your mind games won't hurt me. Girls. It's time we join together to show the school what it means to really belong. I've got $200 for every girl who wants to learn a new cheer. Can we stop this? Should I leave? No, Beth. Don't. Scott I'm sorry. We can talk after school, OK? I just need some fucking space. Fine. [WHISTLE BLOWING] Die, Terra, die. TOGETHER: Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. EVERYONE: Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. [WHISTLE BLOWING] CROWD: Die, Terra, die. Die, Terra, die. May I have your attention? CROWD: Die, Terra, die. Die, T-- May I present your new principal, Ms. Nelson. I just have one thing to say. All of you on the track team better win, else you gonna have to answer to me. AUDIENCE: All right! [CHEERING] Let's hear it for the track team! Yeah! Go Oak Hill! TOGETHER: Go Oak Hill! Go Oak Hill! Go Oak Hill! Go Oak Hill! Go Oak Hill! Go Oak Hill! Go Oak Hill! [WHOOPING] [APPLAUSE] Don't. No, stop. Stop. Ugh. Don't stop. Mm. Don't stop. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. You are so adorable. Do you know that? Yeah, thanks. Can we go? I need to call my mom before I see my face on the cover of a milk carton. Hey, look. There she is. [MUSIC PLAYING] She's so fucking downtown. We should ask her to lunch. What do you think? I think she'd laugh at us. Hey! Guys! Oh, Jesus Christ. Get in the car. [GUNSHOTS] This is a gun-free school zone! When I find you, I'm gonna rip your arms off! [GUNSHOTS] Shooting guns on school property. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] I told you before, and I am not gonna tell you again. Uh-oh. I saw your face, you little hussy! I know who you are! You won't get away with this! Threatening my students. Did you see that? Shooting at my car. Anybody around here normal? What is wrong with this school? Endangering my life for a couple of no good prostitutes. Honey, you OK? (WOOZY) Yes, I think so. You best be getting home. It's not safe around here. Everybody around here is nuts! Hell nah. Fucking-- they don't-- oh no. They don't know where I came from. Uh-uh. Jefferson. Honey. You home? [DOG BARKING] Wear this one. I don't wanna go to the prom. SCOTT: You have to. I thought we were all going together. Forget it. I don't wanna be the third. I've been the third wheel my whole life. Why don't you ask Terra? I'm sure she'd go with you. Do you think she and Cherry are gonna kill each other? Let's hope. Darling. Are these your little friends? Hi. I'm Barbara. Beth's mother. Of course you are. Pardon me? Hi, I'm Scott. Nice to meet you, Ms. Violet. Beth, darling. Your letter came from NYU today. It did? Where is it? Oh, I threw it away. You didn't get in. I didn't think you'd want to read all those terrible words. You opened my letter? Oh, well. It was a long shot anyway, right? I still love you. Dinner will be in 15 minutes. Are your friends staying? I'm eating with them tonight, mom. Bethany, sweetheart, I told you last week your father's vice president was coming to Mexican Fiesta night. What? We'd love to stay, Ms. Violet. Delightful. Wonderful. I'll set the table! You will find my wife. We don't let anybody walk over us. Especially not those god damn motherfuckers at Oak Hill High. [MEXICAN MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Something's happened. Your new principal is missing. Ms. Nelson is missing? Cherry. Mom, dad. We gotta go. I am not a puppet, nor a fucking number. I am Cherry, and if you can't handle it, get the fuck out of my way! Fucking bitch! Maybe we should just call the police. The police always fuck things up. If we want shit done right, we need to do it ourselves. Absolutely. We're the only people on Earth who can handle Cherry. And if she did kidnap Ms. Nelson, we're gonna need a plan. We're gonna need a lot more than a plan. I have my mom's gun. Well, my dad has some guns. We can stop by there on the way. [TIRES SCREECHING] Do you think Cherry trusts us? I mean, maybe we can get her to calm down and let Ms. Nelson free. Yeah, right. I've got company. I'll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL CHIMING] We're gonna die. We're all gonna die. -Ms. Nelson. Ms. Nelson relax. You best be getting me out of this chair right now! Relax. Relax. Right now! Relax. We'll get you out of here, but you need to shut up. We can not sneak you out of here yelling. She's downstairs. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Honey, I'm here. OFFICER: Get an APB out on the tall girl. Don't forget. She's armed and severely dangerous. Ma'am. We'll be right outside all night. If there's anything we can do for you, just holler. Thank you. Thank you. You kids saved my life. It was our pleasure, Mrs. Nelson. You're very brave kids. Why don't you come in and have a soda? Jefferson, they gotta go home. It's a school night. Gotta rest up for prom. Tomorrow's the big night? Yes, sir. Take care. See you at school. I have had it with your shit, Scare-a! Stay the fuck away from us! Don't threaten me, or I'll march right over there and tell him everything. Do it. He'll never believe you. Cherry's the one they want. After all this, it's her they're gonna get. Not us. We aren't gonna negotiate our arrangement with you. Tomorrow night, you'll get your crown. Unless Cherry gets it first. But after that, don't attempt to talk to us. As far as we're concerned, you are dead. [TIRES SCREECHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Beth! Suicide chick? We thought you were dead. No, no, no. I was in rehab. It was great. I feel so much better. And I owe it all to you. -To me? Why? That day in the principal's office, you talked to me like a friend. And no one's ever done that for me before. I told you I was so angry at the world. Until that day, I never really knew. But you made me realize it was OK. I don't know what to say. No, no, no. Don't say anything. Just thank you. I'm so popular. Stop it. Hey, Julie. You are gonna get it. Butt face. You think you're gonna win? Ha! Uh, of course I am. You won't. So shut up. Her dad must've hit her with the ugly stick. Do you mind? Of course she doesn't mind. Look at her dress. There really are more important things in life than winning prom queen. No there's not. Debbie, will you sign my book? Yeah. LaTaqwa. You are the best. Hey. Wanna drink? Mhmm. Damn, girl. They gonna throw your ass out to the curb. I thought Cherry would've kicked your ass by now. She's afraid I might hurt her. You're so full of shit, Terra. [LAUGHTER] We're ready to start the ceremony. Are there any candidates still alive? [MUSIC PLAYING] [VOMITING] My dress! Looks better now, any way. Fuck you, you repulsive bitch. Fuck you. Fuck you. This year, the remaining nominees for prom queen are-- Debbie Johnson. That's my name! It's beautiful! And if you don't like it, you can kiss my ass. I'm drunk. So what if I'm drunk? If you don't like it, you can kiss his ass. You're gonna win. You're gonna win. Terra Simpson. [CIGARETTE CRACKLING] [MUSIC - "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL"] Here in my hand is the name of that special girl. Are you ready? This year's prom queen is-- [GASP] Terra Simpson. Oh! Oh. [APPLAUSE] Where's Cherry? [APPLAUSE] [SCREAM] [MUSIC - "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL"] [GUNSHOT] [FLAME CRACKLING] These days of terror have finally ended. The good Lord has given us strength, and we caught her. We finally caught her. Excuse me! Young lady! Young lady. Were you in there when it happened? Could you tell the folks at home what really happened? Well, some people might think that Cherry was out of line, but I don't. Sure, her path was a little different from the other kids, but she stood up for what she believed in. She said something. Are you saying murder is OK? No. People paid attention, though, didn't they? You're here, aren't you? Tonight, the children are obviously very emotional and extremely confused. NELSON: Hey! You aren't going anywhere! Now, don't act weird just because I'm your principal. You kids have been through a lot of no good crap this year. I wanna pay you back for saving my life. Now, I'm taking you to breakfast, whether you like it or not. We'd love to go to breakfast with you, Ms. Nelson. [LAUGHTER] NELSON: Hey, what's so funny? My dress ain't that ugly. Ha ha ha! Well, maybe it is. I don't know. Ah. [LAUGHTER] [BUZZING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
