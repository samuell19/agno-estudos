Let grandpa cuddle you Hush, grannie loves you, grannie loves you Hush, hush! Grannie loves you Are you dead? What happened to you? Does that hurt? If you know it hurts, then you are alright You know very well Now you look half-human, half-ghost Just how long are you going to stay there? You sat here all night, now you’re sitting here all day Do you expect her to open her mouth and speak to you? A man should be a bit tougher Your marriage has come to its fated end Please, I beg you Stop acting like this You useless object It was a waste my giving birth to you and raising you What kind of man are you? It’s so still and close Not a breath of wind Looks like a thunderstorm Hi, boss! Chin-hsien! His name is Kuncheng Get him settled in Okay This is our foreman You must do as he tells you Boss, you came back Ah Yun! I’m going to get my hair done Fine! Ah Yun, take him to the bathroom Take a bath and relax, okay? Where are you going, Ah Yun? I’m going to have my hair done, I just told you! Oh really? Could you buy a couple of pairs of underpants on the way? Who for? That man you’ve just taken inside, Kuncheng He comes from the same area as you, So you can look after him a bit, can’t you? Where’s that Longfoot of yours gone gadding off to? That’s what I meant to ask you! Where’s he got to now? How should I know? Please buy those for him. Okay. Those two make an interesting couple. Look, now she’s going to have her hair done. She’ll come back with her hair all beautiful And ride tonight with Longfoot, chatting merrily away Longfoot can drive all night. He never needs to hand over the wheel Boss! We can’t wait any longer We must set off now Be careful Okay! Off you go! All aboard! Old fellow, you drive the truck in front You sort everyone out Ah Yun, you ride in my truck If Longfoot comes back later the boss will ask him to take the train Don’t worry! Let’s go! What are you waiting for? Watch out! Ah Yun! Your Longfoot’s guitar Don’t want it? Shall I chuck it away? No, I want it. Longfoot’s stood you up, don’t listen to him next time Don’t give him the guitar Be careful Drive slowly! Okay! This is mine! Shush! Daddy’s home! Can’t you two behave yourselves? You’ll play with anything, even your dead mother’s bone Pick up everything after you finish playing Don’t throw everything around everywhere! Did you hear what I said? Yes! Tidy everything away! You even clamber around on the bed before you’ve had your bath Ah Fen! Ah Sheng! Come over here! I said come here, didn’t you hear me? Quickly! What have you done to make your grannie angry? Nothing! Nothing at all! So why was grannie scolding you? Ah Sheng! It was you, wasn’t it? It wasn’t me! You say it wasn’t you, but it was! You must obey your grannie, and never make such a row again Have you had your bath? Not yet, I’m waiting for grannie to finish doing the washing up You still want grannie to bathe you at your age! No, the hot water’s too heavy for me to carry Don’t try to carry so much water each time A couple of extra trips will do it Now you’re growing up, you must be smarter You’ll soon be going to school, you know Ah Sheng, come and sit by grandpa Ah Fen, follow me Ah Fen, carry it out Careful not to scald yourself When did you start wearing sunglasses like a masseur? You labourers dress like hucksters And now you’re running after that woman Kuncheng Some day when you have time, why not bring that woman back here So I can see what she looks like Come here Ah Fen, I’ll let you scoop the water Scoop it gently Don’t scoop so much Look, she soon learns Don’t let the children play all day long You’ll wear yourself out looking after everyone If you know I’m wearing myself out Hurry up and get married again if you have a mind to That’ll be a load off my mind Getting married depends on the other family being in debt to us Who’d be stupid enough to marry into our family for nothing? If you don’t want to marry, just say so, but spare me your sarcasm It’s what you said yourself! People marry to pay off a debt in their former life Go on, turn my own words against me You’re content just to run around all over the place with that woman You just never want to bring her back here Don’t think I don’t know what’s in your mind I bore you and raised you -- now I’m to be trampled on too All these years since Ah Hsiu died -- haven’t I been trampled on enough? It’s up to you if you marry or not It doesn’t matter if you don’t remarry I’m not going to nag at you Nagging just stirs up your resentment Ah Fen, that’s enough hot water Mix in some cold water, then you can have your bath Don’t be silly. Try to ignore the fact that he’s your son How long must all this heartache go on Ah Sheng! Go and have your bath, don’t fall asleep It’s bath-time Off you go! Father, Mother, I’m leaving Wait a moment -- let me come with you for a stroll Why not eat before you go? the food will get cold soon I couldn’t eat anything It’s better to have company I’ll be back soon Yes -- the torch, the torch I’ll buy a snack on the way back Where are you going to be working this time? Hsinying You’re going to Hsinying? How strange! Why not take the main road instead of this field path I’m used to it Now you’re a fully-fledged member of society Don’t be such a loner Or you’ll never make anything of your life Who says I’m after you! I joined the work gang first My father says so, not me You don’t say so, but that’s what you think Isn’t it? Now you laugh! If I tell you, don’t tell anyone else Ever since your husband died, I’ve desired you True or false? Really Quiet waters flow deep So that’s it! I wondered why you took the same train as me Every time we returned to the work gang I planned it that way, you know No wonder! No wonder what? Didn’t you have to wait all day? Yes! And I never knew which train you would catch So I just had to go in the morning and wait Looks like our Kuncheng’s lucky to meet someone who will stand by him I told you before. This time you’ve got to believe me! Believe what! Your son has a jinx! Just think. The first day he turns up at the work gang He meets that Ah Yun, and her husband gets killed by a car If that isn’t a jinx, what is? Don’t listen to all that empty nonsense! If the fortune-teller is right Our Kuncheng and Ah Yun have been together a long time If there was going to be any trouble, it would have surfaced by now You don’t need to worry about that Fortune-tellers also say… …don’t marry if you want no trouble. And he says, if Kuncheng wants to marry go and see him He has said … … he can solve the problem. Don’t listen to that Lamefoot’s nonsense Lamefoot’s a spirit-medium That’s how he earns his living He needn’t take responsibility for what he says When believers go to his house he trims his sails to the wind And some people believe every word he utters Don’t trust that rubbish Lamefoot spouts That’s how you’ve been all your life Hard-nosed and argumentative! Just tell me your reason If I could tell you why I’d ride upon the clouds Shedding an aura of golden light all around Impenetrable are the affairs of man … . Kuncheng’s on that train You're back! You must be starving! Stop howling with toothache over there! If you want to eat, help serve it up We aren’t hungry! Not hungry! He says he’s not hungry, he’s joining the angels Why do you take such an interest in him? Mind your own business and serve up the food! Be careful! Why don’t you take some food? Ah Yun! Ah Yun! I just got to go home for a visit Don’t be like this! It doesn’t matter Since you’re going back, stay a couple more days Never mind, I won’t go! I never said I wouldn’t let you go! You must go I feel I’m being treated so bad -- it’s not worth being human After my husband died, his family took a dislike to me And my own family look down on me too Kuncheng! I’d like to rent somewhere and move out It wouldn’t matter what people said Let them say what they like Renting a room’s a good idea in itself It’s occurred to me too It’s just that We go off working all over the place And renting a room will cost money I’ll pay for it! Anyway, I have no children You can take all the money you earn back home As long as you’re not worried what people might say Okay! Ah Luan, come and look! All the vegetables I planted have gone rotten It was all a waste of energy Don’t step in here! Be careful! Take your boots off outside and rinse them This is mine! Behave yourselves! It’s pouring with rain, go inside quickly You knew it was raining so you shouldn’t have got soaking wet You should have come home sooner I couldn’t help getting soaked I had to finish digging the ditch Get up! I can’t catch my breath You’re all hot and sweaty even on a rainy day Come and let grandpa give you a hug Stop playing and let grandpa give you a hug Ah Luan! You’ve been drinking spell water again If you don’t feel well, go in the bedroom and lie down There’s so much to do, how will I ever get it finished? Let grandpa see if your little willie’s still there How come it’s disappeared? Let’s see if we can find it Have you looked for it? Have you found it? Have you seen it? If you can’t see it, feel for it yourself Can you feel it? Is it there? I’ll tell daddy -- you still want grandpa to cuddle you at your age Hurry up, Ah Sheng! Someone’s coming There’s the sound of footsteps! Who would come here in the rain? It’s been raining so long, you have to come back Daddy! Carry it inside Father! Mother! It’s raining solidly in Hsinying All our work has ground to a halt -- it’s impossible in the rain It’s the same here Look! Our vegetables are all spoiled Have a cigarette! Mother! What’s the matter? Mother! Father! Hurry! What’s the matter? She collapsed all of a sudden Has she been alright lately? How come this happened? Let’s help her into the bedroom Get lost, you two! Get out of the way! Clear off, will you! Quick, fetch the doctor for me! Hurry up! Fetch doctor Chung! Okay! From today, you need have no anxious cares Your daughter-in-law’s bond with your family is ended She was once a celestial spirit at the Holy Queen Mother’s side She came into the mortal world to experience human life Now that her bond with your family is ended She has been taken back to the Holy Queen Mother’s side She is a member of a celestial host This is to your family’s advantage You can rely on her assistance in the future Ah Fen! You must get up and cook the rice! Ah Fen! Get up out of bed! I’ve called her, and still she won’t get up! She’s growing into a lazybones The first train of the morning has arrived, and you’re still not up Ah Fen! Ah Fen! Get out of bed! You must get up and light the fire! It’s light! It’s a clear day It cleared up days ago! It’s been fine every day! Ah Chao! What’s the matter? My eyes are growing dim! Who was that who walked past just now? That was Ah Sheng! Surely you recognize him? Ah Sheng! He’s grown so big! I didn’t even recognize him! He’s always been as big as that! I remember that fever he had yesterday evening, he cried all night I took him to see the spirit medium He told me he was the incarnation of an evil spirit and would be difficult to rear It’s true what the medium said If he isn’t the incarnation of an evil spirit how come he was born upside-down And put a fatal jinx on his mother? Don’t spout all that nonsense over again It sounds like a fairytale You’ve never had the patience to listen to me I’m soaked in sweat Get up a moment What for? That’s it! Clever old you! Clever old you! Over this way a bit! Is that cooler? That’s great! It’s too bland without salt It tastes ghastly There’s salt in it You even begrudge me a bit of salt I don’t want it, I won’t eat it! Grannie, the doctor says you mustn’t eat salty things You’re lying! You’re playing tricks on me! Ah Fen! Do what your grannie wants When you dish up rice congee put a little more salt in it Put it on the table There’s some salt in it for you Taste it and see if it’s salty enough A little more salt gives it some flavour You really are a lucky person! Sleeping all the way on the train Now you’ve had a good sleep Be a bit more considerate If you can’t sleep, don’t disturb me Hurry up, Ah Sheng! Hurry up! Come along! We’re going picking sugar-cane! Hurry up, Ah Sheng! Or we won’t wait for you! Hurry up! Wait a minute! I’m nearly ready! Hurry up! Whenever we go picking sugar-cane you’re the slowest You’re last every time Ah Fen, leave those bowls and chopsticks I’ll put them away. Quick, off you go to school Here comes the teacher! Teacher’s coming! Get lost! Class monitor! Hand out the exercise books After that, come to the staffroom along with your brother We’re here, sir Come in! Lin Chunsheng! What’s your father’s name? Lin Kuncheng Then why did you write Ko Jung? You copied Ko Yishan’s essay right down to his father’s name Don’t do this ever again! Your regular teacher’s just had a baby and is taking a month off I’m new here, and there’s something about you I don’t understand Why are the two of you both in the same class? It’s because we don’t have a mother Your sister wrote about it in her essay My grannie’s had a stroke I was late starting school because of looking after grannie Lin Jufen, your essay was very well written This paragraph was the best part of all My daddy works very hard far away from home My brother and I miss him a lot When we think about daddy, we hope it will soon start to rain Because when it rains Daddy cannot work and comes back home If it rains and rains, daddy can’t go outside to work See what a good essay your sister has written You must try harder too! Can’t you sleep? Aren’t you going to sleep? Ah Hsiu! Yes, it’s Ah Hsiu! Right? What are you hiding in your bedroom now? Ah Hsiu! I didn’t say anything, that’s all Don’t think I’m easy to fool and don’t know anything A daughter-in-law has to be considerate Mother! It’s me, Kuncheng! Kuncheng! What are you eating in the bedroom, locked away in there with your wife? Ah Hsiu! He’s my own flesh and blood Why are you hiding food away in there to feed him! Mother! What’s the matter with you? It’s me! How can it be Ah Hsiu! You’ve locked the door again! There’s no need to lock it! No one’s going to touch your belongings That radio of yours is in your bedroom Both of you love listening to those meaningless pop songs But I don’t And I didn’t say a word I just thought, as long as you like them that’s fine Ah Hsiu! You know very well Surely you know I love you? I don’t enjoy grumbling at you! You don’t need to act like this Do you really have so many things to say? Do you need to shut yourselves away in the bedroom all day like this Whispering away like that As if you were joined at the waist Ah Hsiu! A man must be allowed out to earn his keep You can’t tie him to the bed all day long He’ll just give up if you do Even the closest couples have to eat Mother! Did Ah Hsiu really annoy you so much? Did she get on with you so badly? We were just talking privately in our bedroom She had some complaints to tell me and I gave her a few words of comfort There you go sticking up for her again What complaints does she have? At most I just grumbled at her a little You don’t marry a wife to spoil her When I was young your father used to scold me To speak of nothing else, just over my cooking I would be criticized by your grandmother at every meal of the day My cooking was either too salty or else too plain Didn’t I feel hard done by? But who could I talk to? If I spoke to your father, he would scold me He’d say any woman should be able to cook rice or vegetables So what was I complaining of? Believe me, Ah Hsiu doesn’t have half as much reason as me to complain Kuncheng! Don’t go soft on her Don’t heed a woman’s words You must be more assertive yourself I have! I’ve looked, but I can’t find your shoes Mother-in-law! Surely you know your son’s character I’ve explained to him, but he won’t listen He just resents me all the more! Mother-in-law! I’ll try telling him again If I find them, I’ll bring them to you I have! I have! Ah Fen and Ah Sheng are so well-behaved and mature Are you handing in the homework books? Put them on the desk for me Anything else? Bye-bye, sir Goodbye Where’s the dictionary? In the metal box Useless old me Always bothering you Ah Chao! Now I’ve fallen ill I’m having the time of my life With you lifting me up and down Who else should I help if not you? I’m your husband! Ah Fen, why are you sitting daydreaming? Be quick and wipe grannie down Here’s a photo of your mother when she was young Your mother was seventeen when I married her You were born when she was eighteen That’s to pin on your chest No, that’s upside down Go and look in the mirror Doesn’t she look pretty now? This is a photo of mummy when she was young Isn’t she pretty? Come here, Ah Fen! You’re keeping a diary? What have you written? Nothing! And it’s locked, too! No one must see! Have you written about me? Put the small pieces in first Then the larger ones on top Don’t put them in just anyhow! You know how to do it, not me! Ah Sheng! Behave yourself! Just let your sister put them away Have you finished your homework? Ah Sheng! Keep your hands off Ah Fen! Ah Sheng! You can use the wardrobe in future Ah Fen, you’re older, so you look after the key Keep it carefully! What are you sulking about now? Bring me my suitcase Daddy, can I put my box in the wardrobe? Sure! That was part of your mother’s dowry Take good care of it! You can still use it a good long time When I’m away you must do as grandpa says And now that Grannie’s ill you must look after her more too Do you understand? Father! Mother! I’m leaving! Who’s that? Who says he’s leaving? It’s Kuncheng! He’s the only son you’ve ever had. Who else would call you mother? It’s so late and you haven’t asked him where he’s going What’s the use of asking -- it’s all the same where he goes Ah Fen! The moon’s come out! Close, isn’t it? Why doesn’t it rain? Since you went home, why didn’t you stay a couple of days longer? How are things at home? What’s the matter? I’m sorry, Ah Yun At last, you’ve said something! I thought you’d gone dumb all of a sudden Ah Yun! Don’t take offence If I get carried away by my thoughts in the next few days Don’t take any notice, think of me as crazy How many days? How many days will you need? Tell me so I can pack my bags and go off somewhere Don’t laugh so bitterly, you look so pitiful Every time something happens at home you ask me to think of you as crazy I think it’s me who’s crazy I don’t even know what you’re thinking about If I’m not crazy, then what am I! I’ve already told you Let me worry about my family, don’t you get involved Don’t say you’re doing it for me It really is for your good But I’m not happy! I’m not made of wood! What I see you so gloomy, how do you expect me to feel?
