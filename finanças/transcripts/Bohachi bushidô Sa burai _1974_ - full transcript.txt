TOEl COMPANY, LTD Shinagawa Station Hey, they've come. Here they are. In December of 1662... Salvador Vilera, a Dutch trader, came to Tokyo from Nagasaki... to acquire permission for his trading business. He is now passing by Shinagawa Station. What a hot woman with beautiful white skin! Just look at her tits and ass! Just once In my life, I'd like to fuck a woman like her. As you asked, I brought you a foreign woman. This is Salvador Vilera's wife. Good enough? Good lord, do you know what you just did? Is there any other way to get your hands on a foreign woman? You're a womanizer. You knew there would be consequences. No way! I'm not involved in this. I'm not going to take responsibility. What are you going to do? What? What are you doing? What a shame. She is one beautiful foreign woman. Her scent is so pleasurable. Not bad. 1 will enjoy her until her very last breath. SABURAI: THE WAY OF THE BOHACHI Bohachi Bushido: Villainy Arrest him! Go, arrest him! You're under arrest! You're under arrest! We can use that man. I'm tired of this. Take me to the Magistrate's office or where ever you want. Daruma, gather as much money as you can. Leader, what are you going to do? You, what's your name? The samurai that dies and becomes an outlaw. Family name, Saburai . Given name, Kyushi-Issho. How impudent! Do you know who you're talking to!? Why did you do what you did? Who's behind this? Say it! Leader, in total, I've collected 12,000 ryo. Not enough! We need at least 15,000. Cast: IBUKI Goro AMAZU Toshl KITAMURA Elzo SUGA Kantaro JO Emi How's that? NUMADA Yolchi SHIOJI Sho EBATA Takashi KUSUMOTO Kenji HAYASHI Shotaro AIKAWA Keiko NAKAI Miki KURI Harumi TAKAGI Aki AKIYAMA Katsutoshi SHODA Yasumori KAWATANI Takuzo Still not obeying? Head, we've received word from Daruma. The money? Well, no, not yet. I don't need it. If 1 don't have my sight, I can't cross to the other world. All right. If you have any last words, say them now. To live is hell. Yet death is also hell. I have no regrets in my life. IKE Reiko Directed by HARADA Ryuji Good job. You didn't see or hear anything, understood? Trouble is everywhere... But in this particular area live many troublesome gangs... and they are always causing problems. So this area Is called Fukagawa, the Trouble Town. Are you awake, Kyushi-lssho? Where is this? This is Fukagawa, the Trouble Town. Also known as "Hell of Women". I see. I knew I wasn't going to heaven. I am Tanahashi Saibei, leader of this area. This Is my underling, Daruma, and this one is Oyakusha. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, again, I'm back in the hell of the living. We've paid 15.000 ryo to officials... so that you were hit by the back of the sword. What a waste of money. Why did you save me? 1 like your skill and that twisted attitude. You spent such a huge amount of money. You must have something in mind. Sometimes we might ask for your help. Please use this from now on. Gonitsura, the mad blacksmith, created this sword... out of his own and his wife's living blood. It's called the "Blood-Sucking Sword". "Blood-Sucking Sword"... 1 don't know If it's possible to keep me around. 1 might just disappear on a whim. Very unlikely. I have many men who would die for me at any time. And also many women with the same attitude. 1 could end your life if I wished. It's not a matter of numbers. Regardless how many people you have, you're just a gang. We're not just any gang. People call us the Bohachi. Bohachi? Human yet not human. The most brutal of the brutal, the most ferocious of the ferocious. If we weren't, we couldn't carry out our business... Collecting women from all over the country... and selling them to... Yoshlwara, Shinagawa, Itabashi, and of course, Shishikuguruwa in Shinjuku. Of course, this happens after we "refine" the women here ourselves. I see, the "dolling process”. Exactly. This Isn't something people with human blood, tears or feelings can do. As long as you're here, I need you to wear this. Are you refusing? Am joining the Bohachi? Guess I could give it a try. That's the right answer. But before we go now, I want you to see one more thing. We Bohachi have very strict rules... and I want you to see what happens if you disobey these rules. That woman tried to leave our group. I'm starting to like it here. Seems like a a good place to stay for a while. Welcome back. Thanks for a job well done. Good work. Good work. How's the quality this time? The quality's always the finest. But it's all up to your expertise. Hey, hurry up. We have no time to waste. Alright, get to it Come on! Come on! Hey... Idiot. Focus on your job. Madam, the leader is here. I was going to greet you after taking a rest. Don't worry, I know you must be tired. By the way, how was the catch this time? 13 girls with great potential. Oh, really? That's you Monkmatsu. Oh, I have somebody that 1 want to introduce to you. You favor truly strange places. This is where we dump unusable women. People say this cedar has grown this big by sucking up those women's blood. Let me Introduce somebody to you: Monkmatsu. Her function is a trader. She brings in women from everywhere. This gentleman is Kyushi-lssho. Kyushi-Issho? I don't know what your story is but that's one hell of a name. What are you doing? I want you to have a drink with me. There's nothing living here, only dolls. That'll never happen. Damn it! Get off of me! Go on. I'm a much better drinking partner than those dolls. Sir! As I told you yesterday, we are making dolls. How about putting off the drinks... and continuing our little tour of the "doll-making process"? Take a look... They avoid drinking the water by turning their faces and closing their mouths... But then they can't breathe. So they slowly take one gulp, two gulps... And when they drink up some of the water... This is to cleanse the women, and also to teach them some pain. Why? It is to indoctrinate them against disobeying or revolting against us... This is what's going to happen to them. The next one is called "clay-torture". We put clay into every single hole on their body, clogging them up... Except for the one hole that Is important in our business. The woman can't breathe. Thus, the only unclogged hole begins to strive for breath. This is an important process to refine their body for our customer's pleasure. In order for them to service our customers better... We teach them pleasure with other women as their teachers... Since nobody knows a woman's body better than a woman. Take a look at these women's faces. Including this part, the entire process of refining women was created by Dr. Gegan. Gegan? Only the ones that have been thoroughly refined... will be offered for sale. By then, they will be finished dolls with no sense of shame. 35 ryo! 37 ryo! 38 ryo! 40 ryo! That's Omonshirobe, ruler of Yoshiwara. He's extremely well-off. Leader, this one is fine, let's buy her! Just wait a bit. But... I said wait. 40 ryo! 40 ryo! Any more bids? The deal's set. This one goes to Yoshinoe of Tanzenburo. Okay, everyone, check this one out. Born in Kamogawasai, Boshu, age 17. Look at this ample ass! Despite her age... she's mastered the technique of aged, experienced woman! 35 ryo! A bid, 35 ryo! 37 ryo! The boss of Senju bid 37 ryo! 38 ryo! The boss of Shinagawa called 38 ryo! 38 ryo! Any more bids? No more? Okay, the deal's set! It's 38 ryo! Why, Boss? Why didn't you buy any women? You know the women produced there are the most desirable. These days, Tanzenburo and Chaya are getting rich with those women. And Yoshiwara's falling behind. Are you listening, Boss? Enzo, gather the entire Korosuke regiment. Well done! Today's auction went smoothly. Everybody, relax and eat as much as you want. Enjoy! Please sir, help yourself. Monkmatsu, right? Serve me Sake. You still dreaming? 1 don't want to sleep with anybody here but you. What? Sir... Not only a member of the group... Monkmatsu is, whether she looks the part or not, the leader of a small faction. 1 don't give a shit about any "group”... 1 will fuck whoever I want. Enough of this. I'm not the slightest bit afraid of you. Hey, I was being nice since you're a guest of our leader... but now you want to sleep with me? Get out of your fantasy world! What's so funny? I'll make this very unfunny for you. I heard our leader paid 15.000 ryo for you. We'll see if you're really worth that much. And if by chance you are... Then you will sleep with me. First, I'll shoot you in the shoulder. Stop it. You've now confirmed his value. My third shot would have blown off your cock. Well, we got to see some entertainment. Now, everyone, enjoy the rest of the evening. Damn it. He made a fool out of me. Hey, what are you doing!? You idiot! Idiot! Bath. I'll take a bath. Who are you...? Who let you in? I said I fuck whoever I want. Get out of here! You beast! Don't touch met! Stop it! Stop! Don't! Don't shoot... How's Omiya doing? Recovering well? Yes, thank you for your concern. As a matter fact, Dr. Gegan told us that he'll make a full recovery in 10 days. That's good. That's a relief. Everyone, as for the proclamation we've asked the magistrate of Kitamachi for... we were Informed today that it's being considered. That's good news. Silence please. Except for Yoshiwara, Senju, Shinagawa, Itabashi, Naito and Shinjuku... all other whorehouses are now officially illegal. However, they're not very obedient, they won't obey the proclamation. More than likely, they will continue as secret underground businesses. So this time we've decided to make an even stronger move in this matter. According to Omiya's suggestion... the Korosuke Unit will be on the move. They will crush any and all of the illegal brothels. And of course their women will be adopted by us, the Yoshiwara. First... Having a brothel in the back of an actual business, from today onward, is banned... under threat of severe punishment. Head of Yoshiwara Omonshirobe... snatched up so many women with the use of the Korosuke Unit. There is nothing cheaper than free. 1 think the time has come. It's our turn to... After all, Yoshiwara is our enemy too. With less places for us to sell our women to... Yoshiwara would be able to buy them on their call. Even if we still hold the auctions... It'll Just be Yoshiwara, Shinagawa, Senju, Itabashi, and Shinjuku bidding. Damn it. They're going to pay for this! Begone! Even though I'm not as I used to be, I am still Sazawara Yogo. 1 will never give my daughter away, especially not to a gangster like you. Shut your goddamn mouth! We have this formal contract. Mizuno has written that he would hand her over as payment of debts. Damn it. What a terrible groom we've chosen. This is the mistake of my life. The contract is annulled! Leave! Forget about this girl and just leave. This girl is now under my care. What did you say? We have accommodated 20 ryo for Sasahara. No, did you, father...? I'm...I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Father... After he's blamed everyone else... Apparently, he's saved you, Shino, from his own debt. Shino is my daughter! This is none of your business! A father who sells his own daughter for Sake. Please stop it. Please, both of you, stop it. Let me die. Let me. Let's go. We won't let you. Damn it! You'll pay for this! I'll hand over my daughter... so tear up the contract of my debt... Wait a minute! Then what do I do with Yoshiwara? Quiet! I am a samurai You're maggots! Father... Tatewaki... Prepare to diet Oh, Mr. Crow, oh Mr.Crow, why are you black? Over in the black underworld... You are cawing, cawing... Oh, Mr. Crow, Oh, Mr. Crow... Sir. Sir, let's go. If she's insane, she's no use to us. Crazy isn't all bad. I'll take her. What? The Bohachi of Trouble Town killed them? Yes, sir! In a flash, three were slain. He's that strong! That man? It figures after Yoshiwara's recent move. They're trying to stand in our way. Trouble Town has become a little too cocky. Crush them, so things like this won't happen again. Hello there, would you like to play with us? We'll show you a good time. Hey, don't lower your guard. The Korosuke unit could attack anytime. What are these? Oil-soaked cloth. A trap! Help! Father! You, prepare to die! Prepare to diet A living hell... for both of us... We have a problem. Daruma has ... What are you still doing here? Daruma's been killed. Go out for revenge or something! Why are you being so morbid? You're a man. All men are so bad. We never know what you're thinking. Not a good idea to complain around people. None of your business. Oh, is it? 1 was thinking it wouldn't hurt to sleep with you one more time. Why would I want to do that? Wait. You don't need to run away in a rush. Run away? No need to run away. There's nothing to run away from. You think I do? Don't be harsh. It won't trouble you to have a cup of tea before you go. Danmari, bring tea. I told you to bring teal 1 told you not to complain. This is all your fault. Why don't you... I see that some of the Bohachi still have feelings. 1 don't know... There you are, Sir. The time has finally come. We need your help. Time to cash in your 15.000 ryo investment? We want you to kill Omonshirobe, boss of the Yoshiwara. The night is over! The night is over! I'm here to check on Omiya. I'm afraid I have to ask what's in that box. Well, it's Korean ginseng. Check it out if you want. Thank you for your cooperation. Please go through. What a surprise! Dr. Gegan! Here Is the Korean ginseng I promised earlier. Thank you. Doctor, the officials of Kitamachi Town are already here waiting for you. What are you waiting for? Show the Doctor in. Where is Omonshirobe? Do you want to die? I'm sorry for the delay. Have you been waiting for long? Yeah, ages. It took a while, eh? Omiya? I am really sorry. For one thing, that tonight's the night. Will you execute it tonight? Yes. Let Omonshirobe suck up as much profit as he could... and then take over his position. That's a perfect plan, Omiya. Is that a compliment or... Anyway, the glory is on you. Once I become the ruler of Yoshiwara, the business tax will be doubled. In this difficult economy, your position in this society will be even better. For the head of the Yoshiwara, one or two million ryo is like pocket money. That's true, but it's still a lot of work. Who are you? I'm the one who was brought into the Bohachi with money. 1 will pay you. I will pay as much as you want. Come. What are you waiting for? Are you the leader? I'm the leader of the Korosuke Unit of Yoshiwara. Mumyo Enzo. Kyushi-lssho. Here we go. Hold on tight! Congratulations, both of you. Everything went as you planned. Carry out the rest as we planned also. Tomorrow, go to the magistrate with the other important Yoshiwara heads. Please take care of the seal of the Head of Yoshiwara, on the table tomorrow. Very well. Sir, everyone's at the meeting. It's time for you to show your face, to let them know you've recovered. Does it hurt? What are you doing, you idiot? Monkmatsu, don't. Shino. You madman! You're crazy too! You crazy bastard! I know. The boss is calling me, right? The next Head of Yoshiwara will be Omiya, according to Gegan. Frankly, everything was a plot to take over Yoshiwara. And, since we've helped them out, we do know their secrets and weaknesses. From now on, we're going to work hand in hand with Yoshiwara... Build a monopoly and raise prices. We're going to manage pretty much everything as we wish. We'll be a huge merchant on a completely different level. That means Trouble Town will be rejoicing and living happily ever after! Actually, we have one concern... Monkmatsu, why did you save Kyushi-lssho? We're now the main suspect of Omonshirobe's murder. It's so obvious, even a child would know. 1 want you to take care of this matter. Take care? Yeah, take care, kill him. You... You like him, don't you? Who'd like that crazy imbecile. Then, you carry It out. Finish it by tomorrow evening. Understood? Boss, do you think she can do it? No need to worry. I gave a paralyzing drug to Katsura. Paralyzing drug? Oh, I see. When it takes effect, all at once... Sir Kyoshi-Issho, would you like some Sake? That's very thoughtful. To ease your pain, It contains some western medicine. I see. Beautiful. One morel Okay, let's have some more. As for the next Head of Yoshiwara... Now we are going to declare our formal decision. According to his leadership and many other features... Omiya would be best suited for the position. Though I'm still a novice, if it's our lord's intention... Very well. In addition to this decision... We'd like to announce one more proclamation. The disturbing immoral events of Yoshiwara were absolutely unacceptable. Thus, to partially punish and teach you a lesson... the government will impose twice as much business tax on you as before. Official, we have certainly understood the tax... and now we'd like to ask you something. What is that? Say it. We think that Fukagawa, the Trouble Town, should... also take some of the blame of the turmoil we had in the Yoshiwara. In fact, we've heard that Omonshirobe's murderer escaped there. So now we'd like to ask the government to crush Fukagawa at once. I see. You who once saved me... are now my executor? Shoot me! To live is hell, yet death is also hell. Dying by a woman's hand might not be bad. Kill him! Why are you hesitating? Do it! You idiot! Shoot him! This time right into him! Did you forget your Bohachi spirit? You betrayed us! Prepare to die! You... Hell is where we eventually go. 1 don't care whether It's hell or anywhere, if we're together. Monkmatsu. You... Human beings are not to die so easily. Boss! The officials! There are hundreds of them! 1 don't know what's going on, but apparently, they're here to take us down. Stop! This place is under the protection of the Shogun. Even if you are officials, without the permission of the Shogun, you may not enter! No need to show mercy. Kill anyone who stands against us. Don't you see this? Do you not see this? Omiya! Damn it! You betrayed us, Omiya! You all right? We have to escape to the harbor. We have to get offshore! There! Go! Hurry! Kill him! Kill him! Go! Kill him! Charge! Kill him! Kill him! Once again... I'm back in the Hell of the Living... Transfer: Kentai Films Subtitles: Kurotokagi Gumi/Kemushi
