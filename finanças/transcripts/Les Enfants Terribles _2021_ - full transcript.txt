- Hello. - Zeynep. - My dear Ahmet... - How are you? I'm alright. What's up? I read your text. It's very good. I lived through your day, experienced your conflicts, I imagined what you saw and what you did... It's very good, Zeynep, carry on like that. Before, it was like I was asleep. I wasn't aware of anything. I had nothing in my heart. I felt empty. Then I told myself that I didn't want to spend my whole life in this village. I'm still a child, I don't feel ready to have one of my own. I couldn't live like that. That's not what I want. That's why I decided to call you. It's been 20 years since I left this village. Whenever I try to write, it's always about here. Whatever I try to do, it's always about here. I'm the first child in this family. Despite that, I feel I belong yet I feel detached from this family. When my siblings Zeynep and Mahmut contacted me, I knew they were about to go through a similar battle as I had 20 years ago. I decided to go back to my village I left years ago. I have to register now, then I need to choose my courses. After that I can go take my books, right? First, pay the fees. Show me how you choose the courses. It says you can't because you haven't paid yet. After you register, you can select courses. One by one, like that. I ask Dad to buy me a phone, but he'll never do it. - What for? - For my courses. You have a computer. Can I do it with a computer? Yes! You can have more details too. You can choose Life of the Prophet. I've already done it. - So, choose Literature 1. - Stop laughing! "Can I do it with a computer?" LOL! I heard what you said before. So? Come on! Hold on, I'm trying to remember. See? She forgot it again. Dad has arrived. Come in, Dad! See how he stares at us? You won't leave this palace alive if you make any mistakes. Now get out! Do you remember the story of our father Abraham? Yes, the sacrificing of Ismael. If Abraham hadn't tried to sacrifice his son, he'd have never reached God. He sacrificed Ismael and only then he attained God. - Do we have any Nescafée? - No, we don't. I'll buy a Nescafée jar for 11 lira. Does a jar cost 11 lira? What? Nescafée is no good. There's sugar in it. Let's buy normal coffee. - There's one named after Mahmut. - Mahmood Coffee? The worst. I like it. Only peasants like her drink it! Aren't you a peasant yourself? You better leave this house! Now you're big, you don't have to stay. We are peasants. We have our way of living, our faith, our traditions. If you don't respect us, there's the door. Sorry? There's the door. We listened to you. Now that you're leaving, you lose! None of you are any different than him! I've never had a day of happiness because of you! What did you do? Zeynep, I'll bury you right here! My sister-in-law broke the window by mistake, father. I can't take it anymore. Are you alright, Zeynep? How did Cemal become like this? And Zeynep? What has happened to them? How did we get to this point? Are you awake? Zeynep? Why did you check his phone? You're the one who will be sad. It was to see who he really is. Now you want to see that? I didn't know he was like that. You saw his message: "I miss you, honey." It's getting worse, Zeynep. I'll check his phone again if he writes to her. You know what else I saw? What did you see? Not now. What a surprise! They're meeting on Thursday. Is your brother coming? No, he's busy upstairs. I'm going back to my mother's. There's the door! Nobody's stopping you. - Take your mahr with you! - No, I won't! Why do you dress up every time you go to Antakya? None of your business. - Where will you stay? - Wherever I want to! Go, then. I just want to leave this place. I don't care about my father. I'm not going to convince him. He can renounce me if he wants to. Without his consent, you'll go nowhere. How long were you away? - 5 years. - You see? Do you know what we went through while you were away? What did you go through? Was it my fault? Partly. You're my brother. Why don't you support me? - How could I? - I need your support now. OK, let's both get a beating. Come on! What? - Let's leave together. - Didn't we both get beatings? If we go to Antakya, my salary would be maximum 700 or 800 lira. If I work like a horse, maybe 1,000. 12 to 14 hours a day for 1,000 lira. You make 900 lira. I spend 300 a month just on cigarettes. If we pay 600 for rent, 1,000 is all we have per month. There are two of us. Why 600 for rent? With water and electricity, 100 for each. How much can we save from 1,000 per month? How long can we manage? - Why are you so pessimistic? - That's what I'm trying to explain. I'm not. That's how it is in Antakya. We can find a way, brother. We can talk to our brothers, Mahmut and Ahmet. We can do it. Do you know what the real problem is? - Our father. - Yes. Moving to Antakya and finding an apartment are easy. But if we can't find jobs and we try to come back here later... - We're in the shit. - Game over. I'm going to explode. Of boredom! I'm bored to death. Why are you bored? I don't know. For God's sake! What's happening to you? If you saw what real work is, you wouldn't complain about staying home. I just want a job like yours. Come to the factory, be my assistant for one week. Then you'll run back home. They say if you chew gum at this hour... You chew a dead man's skin! They have no esteem for me, son! You see? Don't be surprised if I do something really serious! What do they think I am? Their servant? They live under my roof and they're against me. What do they think I am? They're plotting behind my back. Would I ever let Zeynep and Cemal move to Antakya? Will I let her leave with Cemal? I don't know. It's their brother Ahmet's idea. Nobody interferes with our lives. Ahmet is here. I'm not talking behind his back. Leave us in peace. If they think they're capable, let them take their sister. Mahmut has worked in Kuwait for 5 years, Ahmet in France for 4. You were to buy an apartment for Mahmut in Antakya. What happened? Maybe when he gets back. He'll buy his own house. - Do you want to move to Antakya? - Pardon? - Do you want to live in Antakya? - Not on my own, Dad. Over my dead body! - Why? - You're all plotting behind my back. We've never done that! Be grateful that I let you speak to me! Shut up! When you need something, you pretend to be respectful. - When you don't, I'm nothing to you. - Who? Me? - Look, Dad, where I work... - I told you to shut up. You scheme first... then you sit in front of me. - We didn't do anything! - Let us sleep in peace, Zeynep! Am I saying anything that disturbs your sleep? I asked you to shut up. The rent is 800 lira. How will you pay it and all the bills? Do you want me to pay it for you? I'll continue to work at the factory. You only make 900 lira. If I live in Antakya, I can study to get in a university. What will you do after university? You keep saying that Allawite girls are all doctors and teachers. I don't want to hear any more. Next time talk to your mother first before coming to me. Ask for an appointment. If I have time, maybe I'll see you. You think you discovered the world. We haven't yet, but we want to discover it. You think we're just ignorant. - I'm going. - Where to? I'll do my ablutions, pray, and sleep. Tell Dad he can kill me if he likes, but I'm leaving! Even if everyone tries to stop me. - Where to? - I'm leaving! - Where to? - Wherever! - Let me go or I'll run away. - Go to hell! - Why should we let you go? - We'll go to Antakya. Don't start again! Has any other girl in the village done that? I don't care! Other girls go to school. Why don't you let me? - They wear jeans and have cellphones. - God forbid! - Their fathers... - OK, we'll go to Antakya tomorrow. We'll buy you jeans, shirts, a cellphone, the lot. I don't want any of those. I just want to leave! You won't go through that door. We'll see about that! Look! Listen to me! - You want to leave? - Yes. If you leave, you and him have no family here. At his age, you'll force him to eat bread? I don't care if he goes hungry! - She means Dad will go to jail. - I got it. If you want him to eat only bread, go! Let him kill me, then. You have such a dark heart! It's not for you to judge. We're not going now. When Mahmut buys a place... You all drive me crazy with your ideas. OK, calm down. - Why are you crying? - Because I'm very angry. You're depressed. Want some chocolate? No, I don't want anything. Your sister-in-law doesn't complain about Dad. She's new to the family. She wants to work like you, but Dad won't let her. We'll all run away, Nezahat. Wait and see! Cemal, I have a question: If Mahmut divorces me, would you take me with you? What do you mean? All of us leave together. Sure! I won't stay here alone. I won't go back to my mother, either. Why not? If I ever go back, she'll make my life a living hell. I see. For my mother, a divorced daughter has no place in her house. - Really? - Yes. Our mother's no different. She stopped our sister twice from returning. I don't know what we can do together. I have nothing to talk to you about. Because you don't want to. What can I talk about? I have nothing to say. What do you want me to say? I don't feel like talking. In a 2-year engagement, how often did we talk? Just once. What did we say to each other? Nothing! We looked at the wall. After we got married, I had another way of living. I didn't think it would be like this. I began to realize certain things. Once married, I thought I could have a stable life... A child... That's what I expected from marriage. But I didn't think about the important part. Having a stable life with a woman I love. My parents wanted this marriage. I thought I'd be happy with their consent. I never imagined that I'd fall in love with you. If we get a divorce, I won't go back to my mother. That's why we still carry on this game. Where would you go, anyway? Happiness, peace, and love... I have none of them! That's what I expected from marriage. Because that's all I really needed. But unfortunately... - 2 kilos. - 2 and a half kilos. - 1 kilo. - 1 and a half. That makes 4 kilos. - May God open your path, son. - Take care, Mom. Alright, then! Oh, dear Nezahat... Don't cry. Don't worry. OK? Hello, Mahmut. Can you hear me? How can this marriage end? Nezahat is very young. Her family... well, you know the story... Now she is 17. She'll be a divorcee at 17. And because she was married and divorced, maybe her family will give her to an old man. I'm afraid too. I'm afraid of what may happen to her because of me. I told him I'd follow him to Kuwait, Antakya or anywhere else just to be with him. He told me that it was over for him. When my brother returned for the Aid, I told him what happened. - I didn't go back since. - Her brother told her: "If Mahmut doesn't talk to you, then you're coming back home." When I hear he wants to divorce her for no reason, it drives me crazy! The Imam and everyone else say that this is immoral. If anyone asks me, I say it's between husband and wife. Will he abandon her just because... he doesn't love her? I know he didn't cast her out, but he doesn't even talk to her! If her husband doesn't want her, what would she do at his parents'? We could've found a solution. Why did you let him leave? It's not a matter of money. It's a matter of dignity, too. Bring him back! The Mukhtar and Imam could try to persuade him. But how could they while he's away? His father is absent, his mother always works in the fields. He is in Kuwait. Who can the Imam and the Mukhtar talk to? What is it to them? They can find a way to persuade him. If he was here, his cousins, uncles or aunts could persuade him. I wish she'd die! - Why say that? - Let her die! You curse her all day. - It'd be easier for us. - She did nothing wrong. See you soon. They brought Nezahat here. It was the evening. I prayed. They served us dinner. We ate. Around 10 o'clock, we lay down. I realized she was afraid. It was the first time she left her house. She was terrified. She was defenseless... In my arms, on the bed, trembling... She couldn't move or speak. I could have done what I wanted to. She couldn't have done anything. She couldn't have said a word. At that moment, that night... I realized I'd made a big mistake. Did they say anything about her belongings? Everyone's waiting for you, like you're the Prophet. Whatever you say will be done. They're waiting. As if they're going to listen... - Let's stop here. - OK. Come on, stop here, a car is trying to overtake. I'm going too fast. You're not, he overtook you. They are still hopeful. What do they still hope for? She went home to her mom 8 months ago. My decision is final. Why ask her to come back now? I know, brother. Nezahat wrote to me 2 days ago, she asked me what I'd do. What is left to do? I'll load up her belongings and send them to her. Mother said it's not that easy. We'll have to give a lot of money. You know how it is, Cemal? When you don't see love from your parents... Then, a woman shows up and loves you... You've never seen such love from anyone around you. You get confused. Exactly. You get puzzled. Then, you get big-headed. You do stupid things. And when this love is over, after some time, you realize its absence. Then, you see what's missing. And you ask yourself: "What have I done?" Look how beautiful it is here. I've realized I don't even want to live here anymore. By the fig and olive. The Mount Sinai. By this City of Security. Verily, We created man of the best mold. Then We render him the lowest of the low. Save those who believe and do righteous deeds, and theirs is a reward unfailing. Then what causes you to deny the Day of Resurrection? Is not Allah the Best of Judges? Welcome back. At last, Mom! - What? - You're here. - I've finished. - You're done? - I checked the animals and prayed. - Did you pray for me? I prayed to God to show you the right path. It's your problem, Cemal. Join us. Won't you have dinner, Ahmet? Give her a spoon. May God bless our lives, our livelihood, the rain and children. Enough, thank you. Go easy on me, I'm your aunt. Enough. Thank you. - And the other foot? - No. Come and massage her feet every day! Mahmut, come next to me. I missed you. - What do you do in Kuwait? - I work as a manager in a restaurant. - A manager? - I wear a suit. How fancy! And I walk around the restaurant. - What should I say... - You told me to come over. - I miss you. I asked you to come closer. - I missed you too. - You don't love me anymore. - How can I not? You told me so. When did I say that? Don't you remember saying I'm not your aunt anymore? What? I said that? When I yelled at you because of your wife. I don't remember. Just have a child with her. God may bless you with a child. Women are different than men. She would raise her child and settle down. You can travel to Kuwait, wherever you like. But when you return, you would find a house, a wife and a child. And don't worry if you have other plans. You're not even officially married. If you leave her, my dear nephew... I already left her. She's gone. ...she would take her mahr, all the gold and her belongings. - Let her take everything. - She did nothing wrong. If she had, that'd be OK. Bring her home, give her some pocket money, tell her to take care of herself, to maintain your house in your absence, then you leave. You can marry another. Did I tell her to leave? - It wasn't her decision. - It's not my problem now. For women, God comes first, then her husband. You don't know women yet. With one kind word from you, she'd soar with joy. With one harsh word, she'd bend her head down. Don't you believe me? Bring her back, sleep by her side... What if I don't want to? You do want to! Ask for God's help and you'll see. But I don't want her. I don't know what to say anymore. People here talk. They even question if you're a man or not. - What? - People talk, you know that. I'm the one who would spend his whole life with her. Not your whole life! If you want to marry another woman, do so. You're not even officially married. - So? - Keep her. If I marry another woman, why keep her? You were always the wise, sensible, compassionate one. How could you of all people behave like that? I don't know anything anymore. I have a question, but please don't lie. Sure. Are you still talking to her? She sent me a message today, saying she wants to talk, so I called her. - Who? - Nezahat. - Who do you think I called? - Birsen! What? She just sent you a message. Is my phone in the living room? - When did she send me a message? - Just now. So what? I still talk to her. Did my father unlock my phone? It's unlocked. - What do you mean? - It just is. No way! What's going on? Nothing, son. Everything's fine. - Everything's perfect. - What is it? I won't let my children enter my house anymore. Look who sent you a message! - What's wrong with that? - Do whatever you want, then. We are nothing to you. - What is wrong with that? - Will you marry her? - Maybe. By God's will. - By God's will? You'd be banished and have no family here! Why? By God, you will be damned until Judgment Day. - I'm the one marrying her. - Never! Get out of my house! Get out! Damn you, you're not my son anymore! I want to see your head on a plate! We can't go on living life your way! I swear to God, I could shoot you right now! No more. Why are you going? Enough is enough, Zeynep. I stayed too long. But you haven't finished what you started yet. What do you mean? You mean sending her belongings? The divorce? Let them eat each other! I can't take it anymore. - Where are you, Zeynep? - Yes, father? - Yes, father? - Come out here! We need to eat! Put this in your pocket, daughter. I voted for the other candidate. Where does she sign? - No need to sign it. - Why him? - Put it away. - What about the political parties? They'll give you other documents. To respect other opinions, put it away. Once you're there, put it in the envelope and choose our party. Breaking news: 56% of votes counted. For 16 years, you've voted for the same guy. Don't make me angry! Is he my choice? Who did you vote for today? Wasn't it for the AK Parti? They've governed us for 16 years. Has anything changed? - Nothing's changed. - Like our house. I've never spent a single happy day here. Build your own house, then! You tell me I take life lightly, but it isn't me who does that. It's you. You care only about your animals and your garden. Your son comes home once a year. I spend a day per week here. You never sit with us. You just talk about problems all the time. Enough! We're human beings. We can't talk about problems day and night. Always problems? Let's laugh a bit! Is laughing a sin? Does it cost money? I wish I had changed my ballot. I used the one Dad gave me. I picked up another ballot paper. And? I tried to decide, but like an idiot, I used the one Dad gave me. The other guy might've done some good. What could he do? You shouldn't vote for the sake of our family! You should vote for someone who can help this village. He doesn't even have an olive tree to make his own oil. - He has 7 children. - So? And he works as a truck driver to feed them. - What's the connection? - He's the Mukhtar now! - Must a Mukhtar be rich? - No, he should be a beggar! He should have a good mind. A good mind? He's not even 60... Whereas older people are stupid, ignorant donkeys! - Really? - Yes! They've never read a book or traveled anywhere. Have you ever read a single book? Being old doesn't mean being wise. - Is that why you read books? - Yes. As if you'll be a professor... I'll be whatever I want to be. You'll become nothing. We'll see. Don't you want me to become someone? - Don't you want to be proud of me? - Sure, why not... I'll brag about you too. Why not brag about your daughters? - Yeah, sure. - Didn't God create girls, too? God created us all. See? - I don't want your empty words. - Empty words? - You hate it when I'm right. - Really? Yes, my words are empty for you. Boys and girls are equal! There's no difference. - You think so? - Yes! - Look at him. He reached God! - And I'll reach the Prophet! - Can you even reach Antakya? - You'll see. - Why can't I reach Antakya, Mom? - Sure you can. It is because of you and how your mind works! We're stupid and ignorant, right? - Not stupid but ignorant. - Sure! We know nothing about life. Why can he leave, but I can't? Just give me one reason. - Shut up! - Why should I? I want to leave this village just like him. - Leave, then. - But you won't let me. Would I stay a second if you let me go? Find a man and go. I don't want any men. I don't need a man. - Where will you go? - I'm going to study. - No, you will not. - We'll see about that, Mom. Studies or death. I'll die if you don't let me. Death, then! Seriously? - Didn't my birth make you suffer? - No, I forgot about it. Is that how you treat your children? I am your child! My child should obey me. - That has nothing to do with it. - My children have to obey me. - Is obeying you enough? - Yes. Then, all the street children are yours. - Your words mean nothing to me. - Because I'm telling the truth. - Nonsense! - It's the truth! God created us here. God tells us to read and think. He asks us to advance, not to go backwards! He commands us to read. God asks us to read only the Koran. The first verse of the Koran tells us to read. Let me have some peace of mind. I won't stop just for your peace of mind. I won't give up my rights. What rights are you talking about? What do you want? You can't say boys can leave, but girls can't. - Girls can't go anywhere! - We can! - They can! - No! - Girls can do anything. - No. Girls are better than boys. - They can't go anywhere. - They're way better. They can't! - Were you not a young girl once? - I didn't go anywhere. Wasn't it hard to be stuck at home while your brothers were out and about? No, God created me to be at home. God put us in your womb. Were we supposed to stay there? God created us to be at home! First, we were in your womb and we grew in there. Should we have stayed there? We left your womb. We began to crawl, walk, and then run. We began to learn and think. Everyone's stupid except you? I didn't say people are stupid, Mom. Did I say that? People can do whatever they like. Enough. I need to pray. Shut up. Don't tell me to shut up! I hate it. I'll never shut up. You know that I won't shut up. One thing is enough to shut you up. - What is that? - A bullet! Period. Do you want to kill me just because I want to study? Yes. Then your son shouldn't study, either. - He's a boy. - What's a boy? Is a boy God? - They're all idiots. - He goes anywhere he likes. Girls too can go where they like. But you lock us in here. Girls are seen as human beings out there. We see how they are treated on TV. What do you see on TV? They rape, kill, and throw them away. It's because of how you educate your boys! You educate your boys as if they could do whatever they like. Because of mothers like you, boys grow up, believing they can do anything. They believe girls are their servants. Enough of all of that! Enough! I've worked since I left middle school. - You work for yourself. - I've given you my pay for 2 years. I haven't had your pay. You work for yourself. That doesn't concern me. - What did I spend in those 2 years? - I don't know what you spent. - You've run my account for 2 years. - Have I withdrawn your money? Then, you have no idea what Dad's doing with my pay. She's asking me to love her. I'd rather love a stray dog. Do whatever you like! The lot of you! Forgive me, God. Forgive me, God... There is no God but Allah. Hello, mother. Hello, father. We should've watered the grave. We did, yesterday. According to sharia law, your excuse is not acceptable. What you have to do is: You will bring her back home. You'll say she is my woman, she is my wife. Second, you will stop upsetting your parents and everyone else. I'm telling you all this because your woman is without fault. I mean, God forbid but... What if she dies? How will you answer that? The fault is, you married her without love. OK, but if I have, should I go on with it? Or end it to prevent other faults? No. - I should continue the fault? - It's not a fault. Is the girl at fault? No, she isn't. You said I'd committed a fault. My mistake was to marry her without love. Should I continue with this mistake, Imam? - I'll ask you again. - Go on. Does she have a problem? She has no problem at all. I'm the problem. She used to be a girl. She could've married, had children, and lived with someone else. Who would marry her now? What should be done? Mahmut, listen to us as we tell you. With our experience, we know what's best. You didn't love her in the beginning. Now you have to look after her and go on with her. You should pray to God: "O God, I married her without love, so help me love her." OK, Imam, if I may answer, I have prayed to God. But instead of imploring Him to help me love her, I said: "God, you know best, do whatever you deem best for us." Then, they came and took her away. - They took her away? - Yes. This has been going on for 2 years. I was praying all the time. In the end, I prayed to God: "I come to You with this issue and leave it to Your judgment." Then, her brother came and took her. - Bring her back. - I implored God. Doesn't this mean it's His judgment, it's the best for us? She's an oppressed woman. She's without fault. Her only wrong is that you don't love her. But Imam, if I bring her back, wouldn't she be more oppressed? I don't love her. I won't sleep with her. - If you use her as a slave... - You can't do that. I'd never use her as a slave. We don't need a slave, Ahmet. During my marriage, I didn't curse or shout at her once. Maybe it's not right for you and for tradition. Some people are wondering how such a thing can happen, but... She's done no wrong against Mahmut. I asked him to bring back this poor girl. I didn't cast her out, I asked nicely. Shut up, all of you. Does God accept this? Is God guilty? Because He deemed for you to be together. What I do is between me and God! What God does not accept is idolatry. Listen, all of you! Mahmut won't find peace in life after the divorce. I will find peace because what I do is between me and God. Why, Mom? There's no peace in this house. Know what that means? - It means we're unhappy. - We're so unhappy! We eat and buy what we want to. We have a car parked outside. All your children work... I don't understand why there's no peace. Neither do I. It's over for us, son! I've been fighting for 2 years. Should we go on fighting forever? Should we kill one another? Enough of all this. It's not your business anymore. We'll send them her belongings. We'll handle whatever's left of her mahr. - Don't worry, son. - You were fated to experience this. How will you end this? Things are different because she left by herself. I intend to give her just the bracelets. They're worth 20,000 lira. It's never too late to make amends. We lose out. What's left to do? There's no marriage contract. - But... - She's divorced. It's over. They'll ask us to pay them some sort of compensation. That's her right. We call it mahr in Arabic. Compensation as a girl became a woman. Allah orders a mahr for that. A certain sum. I never wanted it to be like this. I never wanted anyone to suffer or go through this because of me. But it's happened. I wanted to talk to you, but I don't know where to start. Start wherever you want, Nezahat. I'll listen to you and then, we'll see. I can't hear you very well. Say what you want to say and then, we'll see. You know that I'll ask you the reason. - I told you for 2 years. - Don't you love me or is there someone else? Nezahat, we've already talked about all that. I think you shouldn't be sad about anything. Just let it be and go your own way. I would've liked to get to know you better and spend time with you. I'm sorry, Nezahat, but I cannot... The divorce took such a long time only because I needed your consent. If you'd accepted earlier, I would've talked to everyone. As I told you earlier, I was ready to support you in every way. Even when you wanted to go to Cyprus, I agreed to help. I'm sorry, Nezahat, I never wanted it to be like this. But these things happen. You have nothing to apologize for. We spent our entire childhood here. All our memories are in this house. They killed them all. Did they kill them? Yes. Nobody wants to come back anymore. Neither Cemal nor Ahmet. Did we even live our childhood? Didn't we play here? Didn't we run in the garden? Didn't we sleep and eat in that corner? Aren't they all memories? You're right. - Didn't we play here? - Memories... Basketball. In killing our memories, they killed our childhood. But they never even let us live our childhood, brother. I didn't live mine. We don't need their permission to live our childhood, Zeynep. At least that is the case for me. My childhood was killed like Mahmut's. I don't know, it affected me a lot. What did? They didn't let me live my childhood. But you're still a child, Zeynep. This is where we spent our childhood. Look what's left of it. A stable! - Why remove them? - I'll tear them up. Stop it! - Leave them. - Why? I wanted to keep them. Take them. - Won't you give them back? - No. I sold the gold. There's 27,000, right? No, it made a bit more than 20,000. Here it is. They agreed on 20,000. I sold the gold. Here you go. What your brother wanted, happened. He can be happy now. Let him go and live his life. - Ahmet? - Yes, Uncle? - They don't want you to film anymore. - Alright, I'll turn it off. - You turned it off? - Yes. I think every human is like a tree. First the seed, then the shrub. Then we change, we grow, we develop ideas and emotions. Branches grow in every direction. If we make it through, we can bear fruit to create other trees like us. Where does it show the total score? My heart's pounding! - Give it to me. - I'm so scared! Look, it's here. The literature and admission scores are here. You have 302/500 in literature. 238/500 in socioeconomics. Look. Literature, socioeconomics... That's the core competence score. Don't worry, it's not bad. It's good. What's good about this, brother? Zeynep, you... Many people can't pass. A million students can't pass this exam. How many students took it this year? 2.5 million, right? Of those 2.5 million, you're in the top 200,000. Is 300 the minimum to major in social work? Some universities accept 260. You're saying I have to send my children to school, but I can't afford it. - OK, Dad, but... - I'm not complaining. Zeynep's expenses are on me. I take that responsibility. So, Dad, as we said, I'll just come and go between here and Antakya. So, everything is OK, Dad? Do you agree, Dad? - I agree, God willing. - Thank God. Prep School Go ahead. How many hours a week is it? I studied by correspondence, I've never had math classes. I'll be in socioeconomics. How many math classes a week will I have? And on what days? For someone who studied by correspondence, the circumstances aren't ideal. We've had students like you in the past. They had to work a lot harder than the others. In this difficult journey, I hope you'll reach your goal. We can help by making all our resources available to you. But I must stress that only you can make this work. So, how will it work? For high-school graduates, we offer a minimum of 18-20 hours of courses per week. Here, the courses start with the basics and cover every high-school subject, so we're starting all over again...
