Here's a story. ﻿For years the wind and water ate away at the cliff that housed Jaffa's cemetery. ﻿In a big storm in February ﻿the graves fell down into the sea. ﻿The dead rolled down , skeletons were wept away and skulls opened their eyes. ﻿"Imagine," someone said, ﻿"imagine you're swimming in the sea ﻿"and your father comes swimming towards you." ﻿Think about the sea. ﻿I'm thinking about it. ﻿What if there's no sea there? ﻿Are there animals there? ﻿Yes. ﻿We'll never get there. ﻿I don't want to die. ﻿Don't fall asleep. ﻿I don't want to die. ﻿Papers? ﻿Get out of the vehicle. ﻿Show me that. ﻿Nice. ﻿Open the trunk. ﻿Come on, open the trunk. ﻿Turn that off. ﻿Get out of the vehicle. ﻿Fuck. ﻿Fuck. ﻿Get out of here. ﻿Go on, get out of here. ﻿Get out of here. ﻿Go, go, go! ﻿Fuck. ﻿Is this the home of George Habib? ﻿He's at work, I'm his wife. ﻿Where ? What ? We can't keep them anymore. ﻿Stop! Wait! ﻿These are George's relatives from Btait village (West Bank). ﻿They're your family! ﻿Do you have any animals? ﻿Do you have a sloth? ﻿Wait, I have to call George. ﻿The children roam around like dogs. ﻿Their father called me from prison, ﻿he said: George Habib in Jaffa. ﻿What was I supposed to do? ﻿Leave them at the prison gate? ﻿Hello, the customer cannot... ﻿George is at the store. 'll call him. ﻿I'm Talal. ﻿This is Ibrahim ﻿and this is Mai. ﻿She's thirsty. ﻿Nehila, enough. ﻿The store has to be clean. ﻿Can't get any cleaner -What do you know anyway? ﻿Lebel, ﻿take some chocolate for dessert. ﻿And a drink, so you don't get thirsty. ﻿No respect, huh? ﻿A donation for the Police Association. ﻿You're Mai. ﻿Talal and Ibrahim, right? ﻿You have beautiful names. ﻿Don't you have any kids? ﻿I've told you a thousand times, we won't film inside your house, We will film just outside ﻿We'll finish up fast, clean up and leave. ﻿No, Mr. Ramzi. ﻿We'll put you all up in a hotel, what's the problem? ﻿The problem is that I have four children. ﻿Praise God. ﻿Yesterday there were only two You had two more overnight? ﻿Attorney Ramzi? -Yes, dear. ﻿Why don't you cast me in one of your movies? ﻿What part do you want to play? ﻿I don't care, as long as I die in the end. ﻿Stop! ﻿I said stop! ﻿Brother... Please leave. ﻿What did the poor guy do? Kill someone? ﻿Bastards! What do they want? ﻿He didn't do anything. ﻿Even if he doesn't have a permit and isn't from here, ﻿so what? ﻿Only the hand with the stamp has power? ﻿What do you think, Attorney Ramzi? ﻿Sure ! It's someone's livelihood, Dear Nahila. We can't now. ﻿My mother-in-law is staying with us, my sisters are coming , we can't. ﻿Listen, my sister, ﻿we will call it off, that's it, we're not filming. ﻿Why? -Enough... -Why? ﻿We won't film your house. That's it. ﻿A cab driver brought the kids of your relative, Lutfi Habib. ﻿Two boys and a pretty girl. They're here. ﻿I don't remember any Lutfi Habib. ﻿From the village Btait. Lutfi Habib? ﻿Where is he now? ﻿In prison. ﻿Life sentence. ﻿I don't remember... ﻿I made up their room gave them mattresses, sheets. ﻿Kids.. ﻿Kids, come with me. ﻿Get your things and come with me. ﻿George... ﻿Give me your hand. ﻿Bring your things and follow me. ﻿Come on! ﻿Where are you taking them? ﻿They're not from my family. ﻿No, no, you had family in Btait. ﻿I only have family in Lebanon, they lived in Kuwait... ﻿No, you had family there. ﻿Their mother is dead. ﻿Their mother, George. ﻿George. ﻿Where are you taking them? ﻿George, where are you taking them? ﻿No. ﻿Someone called a few years ago. ﻿Remember? ﻿Even if they're not your family... ﻿Do it for me. ﻿For me. ﻿Get out. ﻿If we get caught, it'll be the end of us, Rita. ﻿They can put me in jail, close the store, ﻿and no one will pay me his debts. ﻿They're exactly what the police look for. ﻿Why did their father got life imprisonment? ﻿If he's a security prisoner, he might have carried out an attack. ﻿I don't know... ﻿Suddenly I can't hear... ﻿I'll ask Ramzi where should I take them. ﻿You can't. ﻿Do you realize that you can't take care of these kids? ﻿It's too heavy a burden for you. ﻿Look at me, look at me... Rita. ﻿Where will they go? ﻿Action. More. ﻿That's plenty there now, further down. ﻿More. -I wouldn't. ﻿I don't believe you have a choice. ﻿It will grow. ﻿How long have you known? ﻿It's the third month. ﻿I could wait until Tuesday. ﻿At my office. ﻿I can wait until then. ﻿4 o'clock. ﻿And if you don't come.. ﻿Don't cut! ﻿At the end! ﻿End board! ﻿I want another take, Dad. -You were marvelous, darling. ﻿Too restrained, too stylized... Thank you. ﻿On the contrary, you were great. ﻿I know how Granny was. She was a men-eater, ﻿And here she... - No, you were brilliant. ﻿No, you can't open that. ﻿Who lives there? ﻿No one. It's been closed for years. ﻿We never saw the sea. ﻿Why won't you let us see it? ﻿Afraid of your husband? ﻿Need his permission? ﻿I'll give you permission. Here, you have permission. ﻿Rita! ﻿What's wrong? -Wait a minute. ﻿Let me see them. ﻿What a gift from heaven, ﻿You had no kids and suddenly you have two... ﻿Three, ﻿not two. ﻿This is my sister Doris. ﻿Hello. ﻿Want some cake? ﻿Enjoy. ﻿Don't want any ﻿George and his fears... ﻿Why can't they go outside? ﻿Who notices the kids in Jaffa anyway? ﻿The streets are full of them. ﻿What's the little one's name? ﻿She's so sweet. ﻿Mai. -She's so pretty. ﻿The older brother looks... -Gorgeous. ﻿A little man. ﻿His eyes are on fire. ﻿I know how to deal with him. ﻿I'll be with you. Why not? ﻿I have to do it myself. ﻿Why not? ﻿You think that I can't? That I shouldn't? ﻿I want to do it alone. ﻿Of course. ﻿So you're telling me ﻿that the whole neighborhood wants to be put up in a hotel now ﻿because of a few days filming? Seriously? ﻿They claim it's an impossible intrusion into their lives. ﻿Yeah, but we are bringing in money? ﻿We're bringing in a little color, a little action to their lives. ﻿They are happy with their lives the way they are. ﻿And there's nothing left of Jaffa, huh? Nothing, just the sea. ﻿You know, I wanted to film Nuzha Street, ﻿the British ball in the hotel overlooking the sea, what's that hotel called? ﻿don't know. ﻿Yeah, well, they wrecked it. ﻿My parents, they stayed there once. ﻿Fucked there! ﻿They might have made me there, you know. ﻿Where did you get that? -You wouldn't believe how cheap it is. Do you want some ﻿So you're telling me I have to shoot most of Jaffa '48 in Marrakesh ﻿and for the few shots I can get here the folks are absolutely extorting me, yeah? ﻿Everyone wants a slice of the pie. -Human greed, my friend, human greed. ﻿What about the house in Malibu? Or your flat in Notting Hill? ﻿Give me a break, Vera. ﻿I'm paying for most of this movie out of my own pocket, thank you very much. ﻿It's the most personal movie I'll ever make. ﻿so shut the fuck up, Vera, please. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Hi, George, come in. ﻿Come in, George. ﻿Let me do the introduction. This is Mr. Jerry Phillips, the director. ﻿Hi, Jerry. ﻿Nice to meet you. -And his daughter Vera. ﻿Nice to meet you. -A splendid actress. ﻿No thank you. -No? ﻿And this is my good friend George Habib. We have a drop of cognac every day at this hour. ﻿Cheers. ﻿Good to meet you, George. Salut! ﻿That bad, huh? Burns like crazy. ﻿Workers' drink. ﻿Goodbye beautiful! ﻿This morning I woke ﻿and found the invader ﻿Partisan, take me away ﻿Goodbye beautiful! ﻿Partisan, take me away ﻿For here I feel like dying ﻿Once upon a time that was real to you, wasn't it? ﻿It's amazing really how things turn to kitsch. ﻿So you're an old lefty, are you, too, George? ﻿My father taught me that politics is bad for business. ﻿You have the most extraordinary face, George. ﻿Vera, come here. ﻿Ramzi, you think, perhaps ﻿George would be good to play Dr. Tuami in our film? ﻿How do you feel about being in a movie? ﻿It's just a small part. ﻿You want me to act but I am not an actor. ﻿Maybe you are an actor, you just don't know yet. ﻿Look, please, just try this for me, these few lines, okay? Here. ﻿Perhaps a Jewish doctor in Tel Aviv, ﻿but not in Jaffa, not now. ﻿What did I tell you? ﻿I don't even know what I said. ﻿It doesn't matter. In movies you just have to be. ﻿Let me look at you. ﻿Wow. ﻿You have the most extraordinary face. ﻿Better face than mine? ﻿He has warmth, he has compassion, he has care. ﻿Sorry, but I can't... ﻿You mustn't worry, ﻿we will have lots of rehearsals. ﻿Very important to me that everyone is comfortable. ﻿The taxi is here. ﻿Please, George, ﻿I will be honored if you would play this part for us. ﻿It's only a small part, but it is at the very heart of the film. Please. ﻿Take it, read it, think about it ﻿Thank you. ﻿I, too, would be thrilled. Thank you. -Ciao, bella. Oh boy... ﻿He exhausts me every time we meet. ﻿I have a question, Ramzi. ﻿Not for me, a hypothetical question. ﻿I have a friend, from Haifa. ﻿Let's say he's hiding people from the West Bank, ﻿from Jenin or Nablus... whatever. ﻿Where does he stand legally? ﻿It depends, George. Did they do anything ﻿I mean criminal or security-related activity. ﻿Someone in their family got into trouble. ﻿What could happen to the guy who's hiding them? ﻿Tell him to get rid of them before it destroys him. ﻿Remember Jaber? ﻿He was in jail 4 months, they closed his garage ﻿and he died. ﻿May Allah have mercy on him. ﻿He offered you an important part. ﻿Dr. Tuami, a Gynecologist. ﻿It's a big love story between his mom and dad. ﻿They met when they served here during the British occupation. ﻿And they broke up because of you. - Cause of me? ﻿Cause of Dr. Tuami, the Gynecologist. ﻿His daughter Vera, you saw her... She's playing his mother. ﻿So she'll fall in love with me? ﻿Nice. ﻿She's beautiful. -Yes, she is. ﻿Is there any kissing? ﻿Did you hear about Gendeb? ﻿That illegal alien who escaped the police? ﻿They nearly caught him in the store. ﻿He must have done something, otherwise, why would they chase him? ﻿He likes halva. ﻿If they knew he bought from me, ﻿they'd put me in jail. That's the law, Rita. ﻿Do you know what's a 'sloth'? ﻿No. ﻿They want me to act in a movie. ﻿Act? Like an actor? ﻿I told them I'm not an actor, but... ﻿Yes, you're right. ﻿You're not. ﻿You're very private. ﻿But what do you care? ﻿George De Niro from Jaffa. ﻿Not so fast. ﻿There's dessert. ﻿Did Doris make those? ﻿Yes. She was here today. ﻿Shouldn't I let Doris in? ﻿Where is the big one? ﻿This place has been locked for years. ﻿Closed. ﻿Take the mattress and go back. ﻿Did you hear me? I said, take the mattress. ﻿The neighbors will see you... Get up! ﻿Dead people live here. ﻿Take the mattress and go back! ﻿Come on... ﻿Let go! Let go! ﻿Let go... ﻿I said, let go. ﻿Let go... ﻿Let go... Let go... ﻿You want to live here with the dead? ﻿don't care. ﻿But it's their house ! They're mad You know why? ﻿Because they were kicked out of here. ﻿Because they were buried on a hill by the sea ﻿and no one looks after them. ﻿Their graves are falling down, ﻿that's why they're mad. ﻿They're falling in the sand and swimming in the sea. ﻿If you stay here, they'll attack you. Watch out. ﻿”his is their house. ﻿That house has been locked for years. Everyone wants it. ﻿I remember when I was a kid, cops went into that house, ﻿made a hole in the roof so that the rain would ruin the place. ﻿Then the state was legally allowed to expropriate it ﻿as a ruined home. ﻿My father would go in and close the hole ﻿so the house would be ready for the Kadwa family, if they come back. ﻿I was afraid that my father would be put in jail ﻿and now, if the neighbors in the new buildings ﻿see or hear something, they'll call the police. ﻿You're afraid of me, too. ﻿You're afraid... ﻿that these kids are too heavy a burden for me. ﻿My dear, the police are outside the house ! ﻿People walk around, they can see him! ﻿But you're afraid of me, too. ﻿You're waiting for things to go downhill. ﻿You don't trust me. ﻿You don't even touch me. ﻿The poor things, George. ﻿They have no one. ﻿Only us. ﻿What's your name? ﻿What's your name? -What? ﻿In the movie. ﻿Dr. Tuami. Nice. ﻿Let's rehearse your line. ﻿No, not like this. I have to stand by a window. ﻿Not like this. -Okay, then get up, stand by the window and talk. ﻿I am sorry, this is a mistake. ﻿I can't. ﻿Perhaps a Jewish doctor in Tel Aviv, ﻿And then what? ﻿They shoot me and I fall down. ﻿What? ﻿This way. ﻿What's this sea called? ﻿The Mediterranean Sea. ﻿And after that? ﻿Then comes Europe. ﻿And after that? ﻿The Atlantic Ocean, America. ﻿And then? ﻿The Pacific Ocean, China, Asia... ﻿And then? ﻿Then until you see your own butt. ﻿See that boat? My dad had one just like it. ﻿I'll take you once. ﻿Someone saw you on your way here. ﻿You don't have to worry. ﻿I have to run here from the store, Rita? ﻿Why? ﻿was worried sick the whole way here. ﻿Did they get arrested? Did something happen? ﻿I had nightmares ! We can't keep them at home all day. ﻿I spoke with Doris, she can help you. ﻿Why not? ﻿Lately you've been making irrational decisions. ﻿When will you realize? It's dangerous for them outside. ﻿Why are you afraid? ﻿They've never seen the sea. ﻿Look how happy they are. We have permission to go out. ﻿Don't you interfere. ﻿We're allowed. ﻿I said, don't interfere. ﻿We have permission to leave the house, too. From who? ﻿The dead people. ﻿The dead people?! ﻿I saw them. ﻿There are no dead people. ﻿You told me that there are. ﻿I lied to you. ﻿Dead people exist, right? ﻿Come back here! ﻿Sit down. ﻿We're standing, talking, act normal, talk. ﻿Why should we pretend? ﻿There are things one should be afraid of, Rita. ﻿It's hot today, we came here, we'll be swimming... ﻿reading a newspaper. ﻿It's the Mediterranean. ﻿Don't look at the police. ﻿What do kids talk about? Talk! ﻿I'm not talking to you. ﻿Hello there. ﻿Hi, Doris. ﻿Dr. Tuami, hi, everyone's waiting for you. ﻿No, my dear, I'm with you. ﻿Rita, my dear, you know he trusts you. ﻿Rita, Rita, no. ﻿Rita, my love. ﻿Don't force her, George. ﻿Rita, my love, what choice do we have? ﻿Rita, stop it... Rita. ﻿Rita, my angel, it's my fault. I called him. ﻿You're scaring me, Rita. ﻿Doris.. ﻿Rita, my love, take a pill. You'll feel better. ﻿Rita. ﻿Look at me. ﻿Rita, listen to me... ﻿Don't force her, George, please. ﻿Stop ﻿George, stop pushing! ﻿George, stop it! ﻿I'm crazy. ﻿Insane. ﻿It's a good thing never had kids. ﻿I'd drive them crazy, too. ﻿Drive me crazy, too, my sister. ﻿What shampoo do you use? ﻿I won't give up this time. ﻿I'll bite him. ﻿He's stayed with you, Rita. ﻿George is a good man. ﻿So I should be kissing his feet? ﻿Thanking him that he loves me? ﻿As long as he doesn't feel something's wrong. ﻿Two pills and a glass of water. ﻿So no, nothing is all right. ﻿I had a good time at the beach today, alone. ﻿Did you see? -I saw. ﻿You like to dance, too. I've seen you at weddings. ﻿Maybe I infected you, you don't have kids either. ﻿Or a job. ﻿You didn't hold out. ﻿Are you going out? ﻿Where to? ﻿Where to, Rita? And what about the kids? ﻿They're not mine. They're George's family. ﻿Rita. ﻿I'm crazy, right? I can't do it alone, right? ﻿Let's dance. ﻿George isn't a bad guy. ﻿Don't explain. ﻿Go out, have fun. ﻿Take a deep breath, that's it. ﻿I'm hiding 3 kids at home from village near Hebron (West Bank). ﻿Is Rita taking care of them? ﻿She left the house. ﻿Just left. ﻿She's had it. ﻿And the kids? ﻿Where is she now? ﻿Ramzi, I'm afraid she's going crazy on me. ﻿Thank you. ﻿George, she's had episodes in the past, but only instability. ﻿I've told you many times. ﻿She should've been treated professionally. ﻿After the fertility treatments she went through. ﻿She's been unstable for a while now. ﻿Don't tell me she gets natural treatment. ﻿People go to experts. ﻿They examine, they diagnose, they give a proper treatment. ﻿And sometimes they don't know and nothing changes ﻿because this is the situation and some people are very sensitive. ﻿Then divorce her. ﻿I can't live one day without her. ﻿Then go look for her! ﻿Hello. -Hello. ﻿How much? ﻿Thank you. -You're welcome. ﻿Do you remember Rita's father? ﻿Captain Jamal. King of the port. ﻿He was a striking man. ﻿Before our wedding he told me: ﻿My daughter isn't like other people. ﻿She's different. ﻿If you can't handle her, don't marry her, go home. ﻿But if you're willing, ﻿promise me you won't leave her until you die. ﻿And I promised him. ﻿What should I do with the kids? ﻿You didn't help me, Ramzi. ﻿What do you see there? ﻿A hippopotamus. ﻿Want to see dead people? ﻿But you can't tell anyone. ﻿Not a word. ﻿Rita would've told us what to do. ﻿If you see Gendeb, the illegal alien... ﻿He was working at Shahade's tire shop. -Hello, Lebel. ﻿Doesn't he love your halva? ﻿We know everything. ﻿Do you sell to him on credit? ﻿He has good taste. ﻿Soskowitz is pressuring us to get that bastard. ﻿It's delicious, what do you put in there? ﻿She may be from that movie they're filming. ﻿I like too many things... ﻿You don't look too good. ﻿You know that? ﻿Say, why do people from Europe and America ﻿They're always tall with straight blond hair, ﻿they never sweat. ﻿Why do only we look like this? ﻿Because you have no style, ﻿that's why. ﻿You know what I think? ﻿God is from the north. ﻿He's not from here. ﻿What did that Gendeb do? ﻿An illegal alien, from the West Bank. ﻿Too skinny, what do I know? ﻿It's driving Soskowitz nuts. ﻿What happens to illegal aliens after they get caught? ﻿Depends. If it﻿'s someone like Gendeb.. ﻿you don't want to know. ﻿And if they're kids? ﻿Bring them, we'll interrogate, then we'll know. ﻿It's out of control. Who knows how many there are here. ﻿A sight for sore eyes, huh? ﻿So where are they? ﻿Who? ﻿The kids. ﻿What kids? ﻿There are no kids here. ﻿Speaking of the devil! ﻿Come here! ﻿Close the door! ﻿On your knees, motherfucker! ﻿Get over here! ﻿Fuck you, motherfucker! ﻿Let me! ﻿Fuck you, scumbag! ﻿Piece of shit! ﻿Ow! ﻿You beat me! You scum! ﻿C'mere, shithead! ﻿Tore off two of my buttons. ﻿That lousy illegal alien. ﻿I wish they were all dead. ﻿Doris? ﻿She's not back yet. ﻿She's not answering either. ﻿Sure I'm worried. Where could she be? ﻿You say not to worry, but I'm worried ! ﻿don't know what this means. ﻿Why doesn't she come home? ﻿She didn't talk to you ﻿Why tell the kids? ﻿I have nothing to say to them, nothing to say to anyone ! ﻿Rita, talk to me, please. ﻿Where are you? Just say one word. ﻿Where are you ﻿Hi ﻿Did you eat anything? ﻿When will Mommy be back? ﻿Vera! ﻿Vera! ﻿These streets are not safe. You must not walk around here. ﻿I waited for you. You didn't come. I've decided, I have no choice. ﻿Get in the car. ﻿There's rioting in the city, it's bloody dangerous here. ﻿It could be simple, we need to decide. ﻿I need more time and not now, for Christ's sake. ﻿I haven't got any more time. ﻿I said, get in the car! ﻿And... cut! ﻿That was lovely. Great. ﻿Mr. Director, please picture, please. -Oh... Vera. ﻿Nice one. ﻿Get it? -Thank you ﻿Lovely. -Thank you. ﻿Hey. -Hey, Dad. ﻿So we're doing it? ﻿Did you get a chance to look at the Tuami scene again? ﻿Couldn't find you in the hotel last night. ﻿Your sweets. ﻿A bit more lipstick, I think. ﻿You're not overdoing it with the old night time rebels, Vera? ﻿When do you sleep? ﻿I understand what you're trying to do with Dr. Tuami, Dad. ﻿Such a romantic. ﻿But I completely... respectfully, but completely disagree. ﻿Do you? -Yes. ﻿Okay, everyone. ﻿Okay, George... You're by the window. ﻿You can hear the demonstration. ﻿You're worried! ﻿And... action. ﻿I didn't want anyone to know. ﻿You come most highly recommended, ﻿These are difficult times, but I have no choice. ﻿If I should wait any longer, it will be too late. ﻿I'm already in my 10th week. ﻿Is it because I'm English, Dr. Tuami? ﻿I am sorry, this was a mistake. ﻿I can't. ﻿Perhaps a Jewish doctor from Tel Aviv ﻿but not from Jaffa, not now. ﻿I have no one else, Doctor. ﻿George, carry on. ﻿Please help me. ﻿Out, now! ﻿If you do not leave now, they will kill you. ﻿Who's there? Don't move. ﻿He's only a doctor! ﻿What have you done? ﻿And cut. Yeah, great. ﻿Nice, George. Very good. You okay? You didn't hurt yourself? ﻿I'm okay. ﻿You just didn't release the blood capsules, there, okay? ﻿Otherwise, great. You are an actor. A real actor. ﻿Vera, you were screaming. ﻿He killed him right in front of my eyes. ﻿He killed my doctor. ﻿You are in shock. You're not angry yet. ﻿Of course, there are riots outside, he's scared. McMillan, McMillan. ﻿I'm here, I'm scared. ﻿He's scared, he's tense, he's surprised... . ﻿Wait, I'm surprised and tense and I'm also scared? ﻿He shoots, you're shocked. ﻿We can argue later. ﻿Some mints for the director, please. -Thank you. ﻿Come on, first positions! ﻿And... action! ﻿No! He's only a doctor! ﻿He's only a doctor... ﻿What have you done? ﻿And cut. ﻿Okay, next time ﻿more on the face and his eyes, his beautiful eyes. ﻿This blood looks like shit stains. ﻿Make sure that this works properly next time. ﻿Okay, everyone. Can we hurry up? ﻿Come on, everyone. ﻿Okay, I'm listening. ﻿You're in the middle of shooting, Dad. -I've got time. ﻿Vera... Don't go all Hollywood on me. ﻿All right, so... ﻿McMillan shoots a man behind a screen ﻿because he's scared? ﻿Yeah, which anyone could do. ﻿That's bullshit, Dad. ﻿McMillan! ﻿Come here. In here. Come on. Action ﻿It's okay, just let Vera work through whatever she needs to work through. ﻿Ok, let's hear it ﻿Out, now! If you do not leave now, they will kill us. ﻿McMillan knew she was at the doctor's clinic. ﻿He knew she was going to the doctor and here he is. ﻿He sees the doctor in his coat and he shoots him. ﻿Boom. -All right, Vera. ﻿Not just once, again. Boom. -That's enough, okay. ﻿And again. Boom! ﻿You know, Dad, Granny told me what happened. ﻿What are you trying to say? ﻿Had it been an English doctor, Dad, he would never have shot him. ﻿But it's just another fucking wog. ﻿It's not Dr. Tuami, it's just one of those natives. ﻿Can you get him changed because we're running out of time. ﻿McMillan's scared? Scared? He's a soldier, an officer. ﻿conqueror of the mighty British Empire. ﻿He shoots because he can, ﻿he shoots because he's allowed to. Because that's the way it is. ﻿Because he's lord and master ﻿and other people's lives are of no consequence. ﻿That's just speculation. ﻿Dad, it's not fear, it's murder. ﻿And that's why granny called him a murder ﻿and never wanted to see him again. ﻿and you're just trying to sugarcoat the truth ﻿because you don't want your father being portrayed as a murderer. ﻿Vera, I think you're getting completely carried away. ﻿To you, Dad, what happens in the world is just background to emotions. ﻿You'd have us kill the emotion. ﻿You'd have us kill the context! ﻿Another take. ﻿Same setup. With the screen. ﻿So I could talk til I'm blue in the face, is that it? ﻿You are an actress with a script. ﻿First positions, please. ﻿Oh my god! ﻿He's only a doctor... ﻿What have you done? ﻿Don't move, don't move, don't move... And cut. ﻿Thank you, everyone. ﻿You let them. ﻿You let them! ﻿What? ﻿You let them kill you! ﻿Just go away. ﻿You let them shoot you like a dog. ﻿Like a dog! ﻿Okay... ﻿Now it's my turn... ﻿Let's start again.. ﻿No, I go first. ﻿It's from the movie. They filmed me today. ﻿Let's clean you up. ﻿I forgot the filming was today. ﻿Did I miss anything? ﻿They shot me over and over again, many times. ﻿Did it hurt? ﻿Where were you, Rita? ﻿On the moon. ﻿Did you decide what to do with the kids? ﻿don't know. ﻿We can't go on like this. ﻿Not knowing where you were. ﻿It's unacceptable. I﻿t's mullet. ﻿And this is red snapper. ﻿Did you fish them? ﻿Where's the big boy, Talal? ﻿Do you know what a 'sloth' is? ﻿Mai, where is he? ﻿In the dead people's house. ﻿But don't tell him I told you. ﻿Hello, hello. ﻿Hello, hello. ﻿My name is Jerry, I am the director. ﻿I want to thank you for coming to participate in the film today. ﻿Jerry the director. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Today we're gonna make a demonstration. ﻿A big demonstration. ﻿his is a demonstration against imperialism ﻿against occupation, ﻿against these British soldiers. ﻿Against the British. ﻿What reason do they have to be here? ﻿Why don't they go back to their own country?

Sometimes I can't hear. ﻿My wife has that sometimes, ﻿It's blood pressure. ﻿Wait here, I'll be right back. ﻿I didn't know it was them. ﻿You gotta be professional. ﻿Is it their kid? ﻿You were doing your job, keep doing that. ﻿It's best if I go home now. ﻿Lebel, Internal Affairs will investigate, ﻿but don't give up. ﻿I need your professionalism. ﻿Take a deep breathe. ﻿Hello. ﻿No, no, ﻿I want to see the footage of the film. ﻿Of the demonstration. ﻿Don't give me that crap. ﻿How old is the boy? ﻿Talal. -13. ﻿Describe him for me. ﻿He's restless.. ﻿I mean, what does he look like? ﻿He's a 13-year-old boy, ﻿almost 14. ﻿But he looks older, even 16. ﻿He's a little thin, he has sores... ﻿Acne? -Yes. ﻿A scar by his ear? ﻿I'm sorry, I had a rebellion in Jaffa today. ﻿He ran, fell down and hit his head on the curb. ﻿The doctors say it's a fractured skull, there wasn't much they could do. ﻿The doctor will explain. ﻿He's not really so thin. ﻿We have to do a post... -What? ﻿What did you say? ﻿Identify him please, and agree to the operation. ﻿She can sit here. ﻿What can you do? She's the mother. ﻿She's not the mother, he's not the father, ﻿they have no kids. ﻿And if she's the mother, he's not her husband, ﻿wanna know who that kid was. ﻿I can't stand anonymity. ﻿I had a rebellion in Jaffa today because of you. ﻿We have ten arrested, one killed... ﻿What a day. ﻿Let me introduce you. ﻿This is the director of the film, ﻿Jerry Phillips. -Hi. ﻿You must have seen his movies without knowing they were his. ﻿Please, I need to see the mother, ﻿I want to tell her how sorry we are. ﻿Very important to me. ﻿Tell him I want him at the station tomorrow for interrogation, ﻿he should be grateful I'm not arresting him. ﻿Oh, please. -For charges of sedition. ﻿That's ridiculous. -Ridiculous? ﻿Rock throwing, vandalism, a boy died, Ramzi! ﻿I want a list of his entire crew. ﻿A demonstration on a film set isn't a real demonstration. ﻿True, they got a little carried away, Soskowitz, okay? ﻿The production will pay for the damage. ﻿The director is very sorry. ﻿He wants to meet the boy's mother. ﻿She's not his real mother. ﻿What do you care? Let him meet her. ﻿Please. -I told you, she's not the mother. ﻿She is to him, Soskowitz, what do you care? ﻿She's not the... ﻿Thank you. ﻿It's okay? -Yeah, it's okay. ﻿Jesus Christ. I﻿t's Tuami.. ﻿That was his kid. ﻿Don't say anything to Soskowitz. ﻿Let me do the talking. ﻿This is not the time. ﻿You have to go to him. Now. ﻿I got carried away. ﻿I didn't stop. ﻿I was angry with what you said yesterday. ﻿Dad... ﻿You've been nominated at the festival. ﻿Patient 132 to room... ﻿Come. ﻿You come with me. ﻿You come with me. ﻿Not you. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿They're just kids, ﻿they're scared to death. ﻿Doris. ﻿They took us in a patrol car. ﻿Didn't give us time to get dressed. ﻿They put me in a patrol car, like a drug addict! ﻿The cop said the boy died, his brother and sister heard! ﻿I yelled at him, You idiot, what are you doing? ﻿Doris, we can't interfere. We must be patient. ﻿I never liked lawyers. ﻿They're always outside. ﻿You only see them when someone gets hurt or into trouble. ﻿Drink. ﻿I drank upstairs. ﻿I knew that boy would get them into trouble. ﻿Now he's dead... ﻿He ruined everything. ﻿I've had it. ﻿That’s ﻿They deserved to have kids. ﻿It's not fair. ﻿George, Soskowitz won't give in. ﻿A dead boy is food for newspapers, ﻿he has to know who it is, just tell him. ﻿What does he care? ﻿For the law, for the state... ﻿They won't bury him without knowing who he is. ﻿It's an open wound. ﻿Talal Habib. ﻿Habib. ﻿This is Ibrahim and Mai, ﻿the children of Lutfi Habib. ﻿From the village Btait in occupied Palestine. ﻿Liberated. ﻿Btait is near Hebron (West Bank). ﻿Illegal aliens. ﻿Where's the father? -In prison. ﻿For what? ﻿It's irrelevant here. ﻿Irrelevant. ﻿Where's the mother? ﻿Dead. ﻿The children's father, Lutfi Habib, is George's relative. ﻿Are there any other relatives? ﻿A clan? ﻿George is their family. ﻿'ll check our data. ﻿Do you know what a "sloth" is? ﻿What? -A sloth. ﻿What does that mean? ﻿It looks like a monkey, but it's not a monkey. ﻿It walks real slow, suddenly falls asleep. ﻿It climbs trees like this. ﻿It's the slowest walker in the world. ﻿It thinks all the time, ﻿if it doesn't like something, it stops. ﻿And smiles. ﻿See here? ﻿That's a smile. ﻿It's the only animal that smiles. ﻿Okay. ﻿No one knows why it smiles. ﻿Okay. ﻿I suggest to consider special treatment for the children after their brother died. ﻿They're going back to the village tomorrow. ﻿Not tomorrow, in 5 hours! ﻿Soskowitz! -Regional orders. ﻿If we find illegal aliens, we send them back right away. ﻿There have nowhere to be, ﻿nowhere to go. ﻿I'm talking to you. ﻿They have no home. ﻿Nothing. ﻿Only me. ﻿Only me! ﻿They can't stay here ! ﻿I'm sorry, that's it. ﻿I don't accept that! ﻿It's the law. ﻿I don't accept it. ﻿Your objection holds no weight when it comes to the law. ﻿That's exactly why I don't accept it. ﻿Who let them enter the house? ﻿The order was clear, ﻿pick up their things and leave. ﻿Get in the house! use force! ﻿If they don't open up, break the door. ﻿That's an order, Lebel! ﻿An order!
