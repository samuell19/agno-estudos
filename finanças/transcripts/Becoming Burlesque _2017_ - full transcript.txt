Ripped, slightly corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Olivia! Catcha Foxx. Sinnamon. Lady of the Lake. Fisticuffs. Texas Red Tempest. Bast. Pressure Head. How's Dad? He's fine, a false alarm. Is that the hijab you're wearing? Yeah, I love this one, it's pretty. It's not supposed to be pretty, Fatima. It's supposed to modestly remind your uncle that his half-breed niece is devout. Your father doesn't need any more stress. Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'll, I'll just change it before we swing by the hospital. Good girl. You go on, I'll meet you there, okay? Okay. Hey, girl, nice flower. Give me your number. Seriously, dude, that's your A game? Oh come on, you wouldn't be dressed like that if you didn't want it. Right, I put this whole outfit together hoping to meet a loser at the bus stop. That's what motivates my life. Hey, my car's at the shop, all right? Come here. Back the fuck off! What, I just think you look sexy, that's all. Right. I'm Fatima. Texas Red Tempest. Nice name. Yours too. What's it mean? Um, captivating, I think. I Googled it once. And he's drunk. Hey, hey, I got vertigo, all right? Just-just give me your number, all right? My friend's here now, I'm busy. Fucking Muslims. Bye! That was alarming. Oh well, I can handle it, usually. Well, wouldn't it be easier to dress a little more, you know. Easy isn't a reason to do something. I'm not gonna change who I am for jerks like that. And P.S... You know what, you should come see our show. You're a stripper. And you're a terrorist. Excuse me? Look, I'm just saying that you shouldn't pass judgement on something that you know nothing about. My chariot awaits. Later, beautiful. You know, you didn't have to cancel your Khutbah over a small trouble, you always overreact. Nonsense, you are my brother, it is my duty. But I think Allah would forgive you if you came one hour later, no? Where's your Nasrani wife anyway? Maybe your weak heart is proof God doesn't always forgive. Please, brother. Your son should understand what happens when you go against the family. Yousef, please. All right, another time. Eh, are you going to come to mosque before supper for Salat Al Maghrib? Uh, sure, Uncle, sounds hype. Praise be Allah, there is hope for you yet. Yeah. Ah. - Baba. How are you feeling? A 100% since you walked in the door. Good news, I spoke to the doctors, and you get to come home. Well, seriously I feel fine. Mahmood, go and see if your father can be discharged. But he can, Fatima was just told. Go and check to be sure. But I- I'm gonna text Mom to get dinner things 'cause she's freaking out. Yeah, and tell her that, uh, your uncle is of course dining with us. Excellent! Your wife might be the shame of the family, but she makes excellent lamb. I am merely suggesting that women in Toronto can be tempting for a young man, huh? Your wife should be your spiritual equal and not just a great cook. These Toronto love stories, uh, they cloud judgement. This is why marriage should be a family decision. It makes sense. And Masihin, doesn't the Quran speak of believers, so it could be anyone with faith? This is your father speaking. You know, the Quran has one interpretation. It is not for us, brother, to make arguments to fit our impulses within its pages. Nor is it for us to justify all traditions with its words. This is a new time and place and calls for new habits. Chapter 5, verse 5- Okay, enough religion talk. I just want to enjoy being back home. Aw, Dad, but it's so interesting. Your father has spoken. Fatima, a question, come, sit next to your uncle. I'm just in the middle of- - Well, actually I - will help Olivia. You should be resting. I rest my eyes on your mother. Didn't the Prophet Muhammad himself do the housework? Yeah, let's talk. What's wrong? Sit. How do you know something is wrong? It is my job to notice, I am an Imam, and to guide. Here, let's talk. Well, um- I've taken on the hijab as you know. I could not be more proud. I thought it would make my path more clear, but it kind of makes things tough at school. Why should your faith bother anyone at a place of higher learning? Maybe it's me, it-it's just everyone seems extra careful around me now like, I'm made of sugar or something. What about the other Muslim girls, birds of a feather? It's fine, I mean, it's just school. You'd be happier with a man to take care of you. Then you could focus on taking care of him. No, I don't really think that's it. I could introduce you to a nice young man from the mosque. What's she gonna offer a guy? A conversation in thermal dynamics? Shut up, M, I have stuff to offer, I'm funnier than you. Okay easy, cupid. A woman is always discontent alone. It's a man's job to make her happy by giving her purpose. This is one of the great pleasures of being a man, Mahmood. All washed up. Sorry, Uncle, but you're wrong. Yousef, what are you telling my daughter now? Only the truth, she knows. Oh sorry, Dad. The young peoples like to think they're different, but humans are human. Sorry, but how could you even think that this is- Fatima. I forgot to pick up Baba's prescription, do you mind? Okay yeah, no problem. Thanks. And cover up. Yes, Umi. I don't need a man to take care of me. That everyone didn't like in high school? What's her name? I don't remember her name. Oh wait shit, come on. You're going to both your parents' hell for this. Here you go, baby. Hey, what can I get you? Hey, beautiful, I said can I get you a cocktail? I know that my hand-knitted scoop neck is a powerful distraction, but I mean- Oh, I don't drink. I mean, you're cute and all. I'm not-I'm not hitting on you, I'm-I'm the bartender. Right, sorry. I'm also an entrepreneur in the fashion industry. I can custom knit anything from shirts to bikinis, hats, uh, socks, shoes, onesies, plains. I didn't think it would be so... Wow. Yeah, they don't mess around. You're popping your burlesque cherry, huh? Uh, um, I'm gonna get a little closer. Sure. To the show. Oh yeah, sure sure, yeah the show. Watch-watch out, there's a chair. Sorry, sorry. What the hell happened? She really went in and it was fucking amazing. Then a heel got in her eye. My heel, I feel like shit. Don't worry, honey, it missed your eye by half an inch. Hold still. -I'm blind, I'm blind. - I can't see in my eye. - You're not blind. It's just blood. Here, here. Bast, that scar's gonna look hot. If she needs to get stitches, she can't dance tomorrow. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. -I'm all right. Sinnamon, you know the choreo? I've been here for three years. Well, you're on for Bast tomorrow. Hold on, who exactly is gonna kitten then? Tomorrow's my new solo. Right, and she can't pick up the clothes she just took off. Exactly. We'll find somebody. Hey, bus girl, you came, you came. Yeah. -And? It was so powerful. Oh, and someone dropped this. It's mine, mine. Catcha, why doesn't she kitten? I mean, she's got a knack for it. God says yes. What's your name, sweetie? Fatima. Sorry, what did you want me to do? The stage kitten picks up all the costume pieces after each tease. Normally it's my gig, but tomorrow I'll be dancing. Oh, yeah, I can't do that, my folks are pretty, uh, conservative. We didn't ask them to do it. Although, that would be amazing. It's easy, hon. You'll be great. No, I- I should go, good show. You want to kitten forever? Fair enough, I get it. Yeah, it just kind of makes things tough, you know? Yet here you are. Well, I've just never seen anything like this, I mean- I know, it was all over your face. I mean, you guys feel more comfortable naked than I feel clothed. The magic of burlesque. Come on, I could really use your help. Kittening is so easy. I can't, I can't, my family- Doesn't have to know. Why do you wear it anyway? The hijab? It's a cultural symbol of my heritage and my faith. Is that all? I like it. What was that? I like the way it looks, okay? I mean, it makes me feel good. I knew it. So, what would I do exactly? Pick up the clothes, glorify gender with glitter instead of glory. Okay, that sounds okay. Cool, see you tomorrow, the show is at 8:00. You rock, love you, bye. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Did you get the prescription? What no, I'll get it tomorrow. Then why are you so late? What's it to you? Uh, I'm your brother, it's my duty. Oh yeah, did Uncle Yousef tell you that? Okay look, Mom was worried that Dad would worry, so I promised I'd wait up. Okay, sorry. It's important to be there for people, Fatima. So, if someone needs help, I should be there for them, right? Yeah, zakat. Is that a sparkle on your face? Huh, no, I'm going to bed. Good night. - Do you want a smoke? - Yes. Seriously, that Prof is so wack, why even tell us that? Yeah, so he went travelling to figure out where he belongs. Irrelevant to fluid mechanics, but I get it. Maybe I should quit school too. Oh yeah, to go where exactly? God, every effing engineering Prof, they think that their class is the only one. Do you remember sleep? Remember having better reasons for not sleeping? Remember unicorns? 'Cause unicorns are only seen by virgins? You're so wack. Oh my god. Ugh. -Jerks. I got to go, guys. You okay? -Yeah. Snap me. Boom, drop, out, take your time. Ass. Sinnamon, sink more. Drop it down. I need to see you eat the floor with your poom poom. Not just the tip, sit on the whole dick. Mm, yeah. - Got it. You think this chick's gonna show? She'll be here, it's fine. We'll find out in an hour. Fatima, stop moving about. Sorry. Hey, why doesn't Mahmood ever help out with anything anyway? Fatima, my angel, your future husband will appreciate your efforts. Baba. - Hmm? What would you do if someone asked for a favour from someone that would disappoint someone else? That is a vague question, my dear. What is the favour? Well, cleaning up. How would cleaning up disappoint anyone? It wouldn't disappoint me. Kitchen. You are too soft on your children, Waleed. Ah, the world is hard enough, brother. I got glue on a part of my eye I didn't want it to go in. Wait, how much glitter is too much glitter? There's no such thing. Oh my gosh. So, church, huh? That's new, you know, aside from the annual guilty Christmas pilgrimage. Praying every once in a while helps. Yeah well, us Muslims pray five times a day. You know that, right, Mom? Just saying. - Oh hush, you. Wait, I thought Becca and Wei Chen were coming over? Yeah well, I-I just- I thought, you know, with Uncle- Yousef can be, well, bombastic. But he means well, he cares about you a lot. He is in fact your father's most liberal brother. The others won't even talk to him. Oh, I have other uncles? Exactly. I didn't know that, where are they? They got to be here somewhere, right? Uncle, I don't, I can't find them, where? I know he likes to ruffle your feathers, but be good, okay? Show your uncle that I didn't ruin the children too. Yeah, sure. Thank you. You like a little ass love? - Ooze the glitter, Texas, - I swear like a lumberjack. Ooh yes, sexy lumberjack. It's head, bum bum. Ba ba. Head, elbow, face, and chest. Ooh, I'm not warm. Okay, got it. We'll flock each other for that so we're together. I'm gonna be flocking this whole damn show. Yes, you are. Five bucks the kitten doesn't show. I'm in, 10 for the no balls bail. I know, why don't we get the sexy bartender to kitten? Yeah, I mean, he already plays with yarn. I got five bucks on Pussy Galore, Catcha? She'll be here. Cha cha cha cha cha. Cha cha cha cha cha. It is our duty to Allah to preserve our traditions in this environment, that is our test, our challenge. Why preserve them at all, adapt, evolve. Happiness is born out of knowing your purpose. Look at this city, it is full of lost and confused people. Place and purpose. You know, debating with you has no tail. Don't you have a mosque full of people who listen to you already? Or your own offspring, huh? My boys are busy becoming doctors. Speaking of which, what are your plans, Mahmood? Um, I'm just keeping my options open, right. See, that's the Toronto way. No one makes decisions about the future. Hey, I'm in engineering. Really, Mahmood, you're going to let your sister outshine you? Thanks a lot, sis. Sorry, M. Well, what do you have to say for yourself? Answer me. I don't know, uh, med school. Really, son, since when? Since now. I'll be done my PhD by the time that happens. Wonderful, but don't forget about all my great nephews while you're studying. Oh, that young man I was talking to you about- No, thank you. He has a good job. I'm fine. Brother, keep a close eye on her. Look, maybe I don't even want to get married. Habibti, my heart. Sorry, I just said maybe. Like maybe I don't want to be as predictable as Uncle seems to think all women are. Yes, predictability is the essential beauty of tradition, so each of us knows what role we have to play. You are sweet and smart, habibti. But surprising, hardly, hmm? Fatima, help serve. You know what, actually I just remembered I promised a friend I'd pick up her clothes. You can't leave before we eat. Surprise! Mom, this stew smells amazing. Go after your sister please. But I want- -Now. Come on. No, Sinnamon, I need you to kitten the solo. Trio tease is out. What if I kitten that one? No, you're helping my quick change, you can't do both. Catcha. - What if I help - Texas quick change? Or me. No, I need you guys in the audience. Forget it, ladies. Idea, Catcha, why don't you do a second solo tease? How's your back? It's completely seized. That's why I swapped my solo for the trio. FML. You're fine. Hey, I know it's late, but I'm here if you still need me to kitty or whatever. Trio tease is back in. Circle jerk. -Yes! Glad you made it. Stay grounded, breathe, feel each other. Poom poom power! Oh, coming through. Okay, I'll let you go first. I like your scarf. Welcome back. What colour bra are you wearing? Black. Oooh, sexy. Here's your outfit. Where's the rest of it? I can't make you wear anything. I just think that this looks good. Okay. Okay, well technically I should at least cover my awrah. Your what? Uh, my, uh, my-my middle. Okay, what if I just cover my face? Lady lesson number one. Toe in, toe out. Squeeze your butt in, make it graceful. Walking is hard. Fatima, get out there and clear the stage. Okay. Knees together, pull up, chin up, stick your butt up, smile. Whiskey and ginger. You got it, bro. Is that worsted wool? Yeah, I do custom knits. Sweet, bro. You waiting for someone? Uh, I'm looking for my sister. Strip joint's a bit of a stretch, but I like to be thorough. $7.50. She a troublemaker, huh? I don't see her though. Well, my job here is done. I'll stay to finish my drink, keep the change. Meow! Bad boy, pay attention. What the fuck? That's what you get. Fati? I-I'm just helping. What are you wearing? Please don't tell Baba. Are you kidding me, I don't want to tell myself. Please, M. You're coming with me right now and we're leaving. No, no, no, no, what are you, Uncle Yousef? I'm your brother, you're not gonna be a stripper. I forbid it! They're not strippers. Okay yeah, they take their clothes off, but it's different, it's art. Whatever, you're coming with me. No, I'm not gonna let them down. Fine, then I'm not your brother. M, please. I can't, I can't see you like this. Don't talk to me, don't look at me. I no longer have a sister. Ow, ow, oh shit. Oh shit. Oh, I'm sorry, I can come back out. It's okay, it's intermission. Oh. I guess I had a bit of a meltdown. I saw that, but we never leave the stage. What if there's a fire? We burn. How's your back? I'm heavily medicated, so it probably hurts. Let's move, girl. You still got to put three chairs in a V. Okay, it's the heels. Yeah, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop. I like. She's still wearing way too much clothing. It's not the clothing, it's the confidence. She's got something, you'll see. You nailed it. Not bad. Uh, hello, I just did my first show. Can I get a little bit of love? You were lovely dear. No one doubted you would be. Oooh, hot date tonight, Lake Lady? Don't rush, make him wait. I can't help it. He's all arms, legs, freckles. It's divine. We will never fight over a man. - Rehearsal tomorrow with - Sinnamon and Fatima in. Tonight was a mess. I'll see you ladies up there for a drink. See you. -Oh, order me one. So, think there'll be a second date? Hell no, she'll be lucky if she makes it to last call. What, why not? She has a thing for fuck boys. That's a thing you can have? So, who's boning you these days? Me? No one. Oh, what a waste. I saw Justin eye-banging you all night. You a night rider? What? What? He's obsessed with Catcha Foxx. Oh, he's so sweet, but when he talks about wool, I get so sleepy. I get awkward with guys, so. You just have to look them in the eyes. It disarms them. Hey, are you guys decent? Oh, somebody's ears are burning, and by ears I mean. Get your flirt on, girl. Now? No, next Tuesday. Just look him in the eye, don't look away until he does. Come on in. Hey, what's up ladies? Beautiful show, Catcha Foxx, honestly, they loved it. Uh, you guys sticking around for drinks? The guy upstairs is buying. Oh yeah. -Hell yeah, shots from God. He's just a super fan, he really loved the show and actually he ordered a stitched rib silk yarn jumpsuit. You okay? I have something on my face or... We'll be up in five. Okay cool, see you upstairs. What is wrong with me? It just takes practice, it's okay. Coming Catcha? What'd I miss? She wasn't kidding. Do you have to go home? Um, well there's either a shit storm waiting for me at home or there isn't, I wouldn't know until I get there. It's Schrodinger's cat, so I might as well just hang out for a bit. Okay. Salut. -Salut. Cheers, ladies, well earned. Thank you. You know a shot would help. I can't, I don't drink. Hey, Justin, get her a virgin virgin Woolly Navel on the fan tab. You know, the, the better looking he is, the harder he is to look at. Let's try it with the super fan. Now shoot him a look. I don't want to distract him. Yes, you want to. Don't force it, don't. Stop it. Ugh. Okay, what's the difference between stripping and burlesque? Um, pasties? Oh man. In stripping, the observer imposes their fantasy on the performer. In burlesque, we impose our fantasies on the crowd. It's a preference. Some people like men, women, threesomes, farm animals. We fuck the audience. Justin, another round for the ladies please. Oh my god. I don't always have so much sugar. I am an asshole. Okay, promise me you're gonna drink some water before bed, okay? Hey, look, look, I'm standing by myself. Okay. And I'm walking by myself, see? Wow, you really don't drink, do you? I'm gonna look at you until you look away. You guys are so beautiful, I love you guys. You're beautiful too, Fatima. Okay, are you okay to get home from here? I am home. Okay, rehearsal tomorrow. Be safe. I chickened out. Just don't go back. Ah, we're having songbird for breakfast? Good morning, Baba. Good morning. Oh, angel pie, these eggs look magnificent. And the pinyo smells sublime. I'll get my own. Okay, I have a study date. I will see you guys later, bye. Okay, bye. You know, it's a treat for a dad to see his daughter like that. One day you'll know, Mahmood. You're early. I didn't know what time rehearsal was, so. Girl, never before noon. Oh, sorry. Don't apologize, come. Okay. So, does your family know? My mom comes to everything. My dad doesn't, but he knows burlesque is my thing. Why? The glamour, the freedom, feeling alive in my own skin. Come, give me your weight. Oh, sorry, sorry. It's okay. Back to back. Oh sorry, I'm, I mean, I'm hurting you. It's okay. Okay. Again. Where are you from? My dad's from Syria but studied in England where he met my mom. She was born in Thunder Bay and her family is Polish and Irish with a hint of Ukrainian. I'm just Toronto. You're more than that. Now look at me in the face and try to mirror me. You're a magical creature. Now they go inside. Yeah. And back. And now let's try keeping the water droplet alive. Whoa. Yeah? Come, close your eyes. Just let it go. It's hard to let it go. Breathe. No judgement. Better? Yeah. This feeling, that's the beginning. I feel like I just covered up everything. I want to feel like this all the time. You need a burlesque name. How about Wobbly? Something. Flirt. Lousy Flirt? Flirt Fail? No, Flirt. Let me think about it. Okay. Too many Lenny's. My body's not having me today. Okay. That's why I drink gin. Yeah, the drink of psychopaths. Get it together, rehearsal in 10. Left, back, right, front. Left, back, right. What are you doing? Can you knock? Look, I have to tell Dad. Yeah, you think that's a good idea? You're right, but... Why, Fati? I don't know, M, being a girl here is such a treat. Oh please, at least you're not supposed to have it all together. Just forget it. I can't even stop my sister from working at a strip club. Honestly, I-I don't want you to go back. Please. Shit, shit. Oh, trouble in paradise over there? I just got fired over email. From the reception gig? I thought they loved you. Well, apparently my boss saw a photo on Insta and freaked. Oh wait no, his wife did. Well, at least you still have this gig. Ha, that's very funny. Ten minutes ladies. Maybe Justin will put me back on bar. No, I need you on stage. Catcha, why doesn't Fatima learn the- No, she can't dance like you yet. Plus, we can't afford another dancer. I don't even have a name yet. Babylon. Strong, powerful, decadent, immoral. Go kiss someone. Kiss, not kill. Who was that? ("Of All the People Here" by Freeman Dre and the Kitchen Party) Forget it, M, I'm not leaving. If you won't leave, I'm staying. What? I'm your bother, I'll protect you. What are you- Ah, Babylon comes with her own manservant, I like. This is not a good idea. Now you've been dancing a record three days we need someone to kitten, hmm? But- You stay, I stay. Take off your shirt. This is a bad idea. Wait here to clear the stage. I love. This is a bad- That's all of it, okay? Do you mind? You know, you're too beautiful to be taking your clothes off. Isn't that reason to? Wow, you have a strong back. Dudes are dogs. You're tight. You're too hard on yourself. Uh, you- You work hard, I'm, I'm really lazy. So stop. ("Let's Get this Show on the Road" by Freeman Dre and the Kitchen Party) Your brother looks hot. This can't end well. Catcha likes it when we go and mingle. You are not paid to watch. I'm not paid at all. So, what do we do? Just go and stir it up. Oh sorry. Include us in your next round and we might not destroy your table. I love you, Texas! I love you too, Whiskey Neat. They don't know a fuck up unless we're apologetic. They get what we give them and that's it, okay? Babylon, Catcha Foxx lost a pastie, you're on. Now you're part of the show. Go get it. Be cute. It won't stick. Press harder. I am, her boob is squishy. Okay, it's on. Okay, come on. Nice work, Babylon. Nicely done, manservant. I need a shot. Hold on, you can drink but your sister can't? I'm a guy. Oh, that's such donkey shit. Hey, the Quran itself said alcohol is good and bad, so I guess I'm just taking in the good. Yeah, well the Quran can kiss my- You know what, let's just have another shot. Or five. You know what your problem is? You're always trying to control yourself. Controlling myself is necessary. Why, what's gonna happen? You want to kiss me? Not anymore. See, you're free to do whatever you want, but so are we. -Mmhmm. Consent isn't enough anymore, aim for enthusiasm. Hey, great show ladies. Thank you. God, I miss getting naked with you guys. Hey yeah you do, I just had a mini. Yes! I saw her eyes glaze over and I knew. Jealous. A mini? Oh yeah, she's real happy right now. I'd be mortified if that happened anywhere let alone on stage. What do you think it's there for, honey? I could use a good one. Mr. Skinny Freckles from Dublin was a bust, literally. Anybody surprised? You should try an island boy next time. Ireland's an island. I meant Montreal. I just like the Irish guys. Their skin feels like two-sided tape. And on that note. Hate to break up the party, but ticket sales are crap, so I had to cut your pay. That's fine. Thanks, girl. - Don't sweat it. I need you to promote, promote, promote. Don't be lazy. Wait, this is what you guys get paid? We don't do it for the money. But you work so hard. Nobody's keeping you here. You just did it for the cash? Uh, no, I'm not, it's just-just engineering brain. My ex-boyfriend's brother is an engineer. I fucked an engineer once and it was so boring. Uh, so, tequila time. Bye. -Bye. Bye. -Bye. It doesn't bother you to see me ordered around? I didn't ask you to follow me. I'm your brother. Don't pull that crap, that's not why you're doing this. You think I'm here for the women? I can get my own women. Whatever. Besides, Catcha Foxx isn't my type of girl. Catcha Foxx, really? -Don't, don't. Don't. Yeah, bring her home to Mom and Dad, that'll be awesome. And to Uncle, praise Allah. I'm here for you, Fati. Yeah, what does it do for me? Well, it was either lose respect for you completely or try and figure out why. How are you so dumb and so smart at the same time? It boggles the mind. You been going to mosque? I mean, I think about the principles still every day, but- Why, aren't you? Only when Uncle's around, don't tell Mom. I kind of miss it, but I don't know now. Allah will forgive you if your heart's in the right place. Is it? Why, Fati, why, why all this? Look, I fit in for once. Everywhere else I'm pretending. At least on stage I'm not lying to anyone. I mean, yeah I'm acting, but I'm not lying. It feels right. Just tell Allah that. Yeah maybe. What are you gonna tell him? That he can like me best now because my sister's a stripper. Jerk! Get out of here. Oh, I was worried there for a hot minute, bringing in a total stranger? Is this about her learning the show faster than you did? No. You're lying. Look, she was even accusing you of exploiting us. What do you suggest? Get rid of her. Just 'cause she got promoted to dancer does not mean that you got promoted to producer. Go home, Sinnamon. Wait, is it foom, hit, foom? No, it's foom, hit, wait, foom. Right. Everybody listen up. Box office money is missing from my desk. That was from before, I swear. All right. Well if you took the money then step forward. Nobody gets paid until the money is back on my desk. Show is in an hour. Where are you sneaking off to? Just out. Shouldn't you be prepping the MCAT? Yousef called, you missed prayer. Can you make a bit more effort please? Fine, can I go now? Where? I got a job, okay? But that's wonderful, your father will be thrilled. No, it's, no, Mom, it's just not a good job. Waleed, Mahmood has some news. I got a job. Oh, where? It's nothing, it's at a restaurant just bussing or whatever. You know I worry about you, son. I mean look at your sister, she's going to university with excellent marks and you don't even try. Bussing? -Love, he has a job. Yeah, but I just don't understand why he always let's himself be outperformed by his sister. My son is bussing. Well, guess what, she's on stage at the same shitty club. So, she's not so perfect after all. Come back. Come on. Whatever you're feeling, just leave it in the change room. You're magic. And I don't care about the money. We'll have a fundraiser and we'll move on, yeah? Now let's go fuck them in the heart. Fatima is performing there? Oh, just, uh, she's dancing. Dancing? You-you mean at the club or on stage? Look, they-they have entertainment at the club, shows. So, she's just helping. What do you mean dancing? It's a-it's a cabaret lounge, so they do dance shows. You know, kind of like vaudeville. I see. So she's...dancing. Why didn't she tell us? Look, it was a surprise, and I screwed up, okay. So maybe we just don't mention it. We should go and see this dancing. No, no, no, no, no, you wouldn't like it. It's, uh, the-the music is terrible, it's rock and roll, right? It's not even, it's not even, uh, it's dimly lit. No, no, we support. Dear, no one just dances at a club. Maybe you should talk to her. Or don't talk to her, because I can talk to her. What club, son, hmm? I-I-I don't know. What club? You're set. Damn, I want to be in this. Mahmood, my man, what's up? Rocking the range? Sweet stitches, Pop. What kind of place is this? Do you have my glasses? It's a cabaret lounge, music, shows, dancing, drinks, you know, that stuff. What are you doing? It was an accident, I didn't think they were gonna come. What? Let's go, Waleed, you should be resting. Yeah. No, no, no, this is their world, not ours, uh, we should give it a chance. Glasses. Oh. -Waleed. Baba. Breathe. What are you doing here? That is a question to ask yourself. Hi, I need an ambulance to, uh, where? 1585 Dundas Street West. 1585 Dundas Street West. My husband is having a heart attack. I'm going to get a coffee. I have nothing to say to you. You always told me to keep an open mind about school, politics, about people. This is different. How? It just is. But how? People pay to look at your body, think disgusting thoughts. Dad, it's not like that. If you can't see it for what it is, then this conversation is over. She's as stubborn as you were. I knew she'd test me, but I never- Call him. You sure? You told Uncle, seriously? Well, better he hear it from us. Okay. Oh man, what do you think he's gonna do? He'll offer her guidance, this is his calling. Yeah, guidance. Okay, you all right? -Yeah. I got to go tell her. Hey, Mom. Where's the coriander? I know it's around here somewhere. Mom, I just want you to know that- Oh, here it is of course. It's not what you- -Hockey? What? Or figure skating, everyone in Thunder Bay was quite happy on the ice, maybe that- Uh- -You never know until you try. Okay, okay sure, but-but- Or I could bring you to my church. No thanks, I'm not changing religions, Mom. Is this a bad time? Not at all, just cooking. Okay look, I just- Oh wow, I forgot to preheat the oven. I'm a mess. Okay, I'll-I'll catch you later I guess. Just- use protection, okay? Mom, it's theatre. Of course, dear. They don't get it. Hello, lovers, we are fundraising tonight. Rhinestones are very expensive. So one lucky audience member is going to have a personal tease. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, fuckers, so who's gonna give me $100? Let them come, I'll be gone anyway. Very generous. Looks like our woolly handsome Justin wants a break from bartending with a bid of... $225. But think about how long you're gonna be telling this story for, people. $325! $325! Will our star bartender get back in the game? $330. Five bucks? Seriously? Going once. Hope they take credit cards. Going twice. $1,000. Are you single? Maybe tonight. Sold to the smooth ass stylish person in the back. Come on up here, sweetheart. Everyone in the room is completely jealous of you right now. You okay? Nope, I need you to do the finale for me. What about this dance? -Just go. Just say goodbye already. Oh fuck, her back. You're killing it! Whatever. Look at this place. Okay, just look for her. Okay let's go, she's not here. What? Who are those guys? My cousins. Come on. Sit down, the show's started. Excuse me, this is family business. We- Hi there, handsome. No thanks, thank you. Uh uh, you don't want to piss me off. She said sit the fuck down. Yo, Amir, these bitches are crazy. Let go of me, you slut. Out of my way. Okay, move! Get the fuck off my brother. Show is happening, you can leave now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what you are nuts? I'm defending myself, they attacked us. Hey, what are you guys doing? Mahmood, what are you doing here? These girls are not hookers, man. It's an artsy thing, all right? Just go. No can do, cousin, your family's too weak to handle this. Look, let us just take her home, it's cool. She's confused, she'll come around. Haram. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, relax, relax. She's my sister, I see you guys twice a year. That bitch fired! Come on, he's not gonna buy that. I didn't do anything. It doesn't really matter. Sinnamon. What? Oh now I can't even help protect the new girl? Oh, I'm not good enough for that? Fine, let them just take what they came for, fuck her! I've been here longer, I would follow you anywhere. I'm a better dancer, I'm a better performer. Why should I listen to you any fucking more? Stop it! I'm causing all this trouble. It's not your problem, Catcha. Or yours, Amir. I'm sorry you got involved. Look I'm leaving, okay, problem solved. Sinnamon, Catcha loves you, you're just too dumb to see it. And don't ever threaten my family again. Mahmood! Hey, you want me to take a look at that? I'm a pre-med. No. You know, you really screwed up this time. There's no turning back from this. You don't exist. What, come on, man. What the fuck? I was just protecting us, you from all this bullshit. I was- -I don't want to hear it. Too bad they had to go so soon. Yeah, but with showgirl herpes though. Yeah, they're gonna sparkle for days. It's over. she can't keep dancing, not with a family that's involved. You're her family. Oh my god, I'm trying to be, but she doesn't listen. And I'm sitting right alongside her, so what type of man does that make me? A great one. Look, I'm gonna marry a Muslim. Oh, when? You're not wife material. Me? A wife is domestic, she raises children. Among other things. -She fasts. I used to fast, then I got better. Are you okay? Look, a-a wife isn't a half-naked dancer covered in sparkles, it's not an option. Marry whoever. Dammit, why are you so perfect? Practice. The term is mad. But my cousins, Uncle, really? Why do you even care so much? You are my family. Well, then support me. You have turned your back on Islam. Okay, that's a little dramatic. There's more than one way to be a Muslim. There is one way, the way written in the Quran. That's not the same thing. It's not. Allah, I am an Imam. So, are you telling me I must submit to your will as well as Allah's? Show me, Fatima, show me where in the Quran it says, what you do is not haram and I will follow. I don't need you to follow me. Chapter 31 verse 24, in the name of Allah the most merciful and the most gracious, and tell the believing women to guard their private parts and not expose their adornment. Which pasties do. You know that is not the meaning. Look, Uncle, my private self cannot be hidden or revealed with clothing because I'm more than just skin. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. Except what the hand possesses. I could argue I possess the audience. That is, you are twisting the language to fit your purpose. So are you! You are a spiritual guide, but you've abandoned my spirit. If my own niece won't listen to my words, how can I lead prayer and expect people to listen? So, the problem is your reputation? No, it is you putting your body on display. Wake up, Uncle. Look, men will gaze whether a girl's wearing pasties or a full on niqab, men will look. It's a primal force of nature. Look, burlesque releases me from the fear of that gaze. It-it's my art, it let's be myself, and men don't own it. And you don't own me. Look, I don't want this to affect you. I can cover my awrah with scarves, would that help? I have a stage name, no one needs to know. They will find out. What about your connection to Allah? Will you cover that too? No, I believe Allah wants me to stay truthful to myself. And truthfully, God's gaze is the only one I care about. Fatima, you are like my daughter. Please. Please reconsider. I'm so sorry, Uncle, but I couldn't stop if I wanted to. A hijab pin? Those things get in everything. Just like rhinestones. Help me out here. I dance, I lose my family. I don't dance, I lose myself. What do I do? That's up to you. And this shouldn't be such a big deal, right? It's my body, why can't I just do what I want with it like everyone else in this city? Because it's not, it belongs to your father until you get married. Traditionally anyways. Tradition and faith are not synonyms, they can't be. Then there's your answer. I have to do it. A burlesque tease. It's the only way I'll know for sure. - Yes. - Yes! Heck yes! Or don't. So what's the secret? No secret, just make it your own. Yes! How can I be angry with them when the apple falls so close to the tree? Your undoing was love, not lust. Our father would argue that. This was my fault, your Baba was right. My father was a bully, may Allah rest his soul. You inspired me to hold onto my faith. You're my light and my rock. Still, think of Fatima in that place. Today I understand my father better. But I'm not going to lose my children over it. Yousef, I will not force her. Will no one listen? What am I supposed to do? May God guide us all to the right path. -- English --
