( keys jingle ) - WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? - ( cocks gun, gunshot ) ( gunshots ) THEY'RE ALL DEAD. YEAH, THE MONEY'S ALL HERE. I'LL MAKE THE DROP MYSELF. ( gunshots ) HE WAS BREATHING. OH, IT'S NOTHING. IT WAS OLGA TYING UP A LOOSE END. WHAT DO YOU WANT DONE WITH THE DRUGS? THAT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE. THE PSYCH AT WORK SAYS I'M TIGHT, THAT I'M EMOTIONALLY BRITTLE, SAYS THAT I SHOULD TALK TO YOU, MAYBE COME DOWN HERE, SPEND A HALF-HOUR AND GET IT OFF MY CHEST, SO... EXCUSE ME? WERE YOU TALKING TO ME? NO, I-- I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU. ( pager beeping ) - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY. - FIND 'EM? - NO. LET'S JUST GO. ( police radio chatter ) JUST SHOOT AND DUST THE OUTSIDE. WE'LL GRAB THE INTERIORS BACK AT THE SHOP. ( camera shutter clicks ) ( birds chirping ) - BERT. - HEY, WHAT'S SHAKING? THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT YOU COULD USE A HAND. NAH, IT'S PRETTY WELL UNDER CONTROL. WE'RE JUST BAGGING AND TAGGING. - HOW MANY? - FIVE. - ANYONE WE KNOW? - NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. - .458 MAGNUM? - YEAH. HOLES BIG ENOUGH TO PUT YOUR FIST IN. AND I'LL GUARANTEE THEY DRILLED AND TAPPED THE HEADS TO GIVE THEM EXTRA PUNCH. DUM-DUMS. THAT'S COLD. MOST OF THE BIG HITS LINE UP FROM OVER THERE. OFF THE CUFF, MY GUESS IS TWO SHOOTERS: ONE ON THE OUTSIDE WORKING THE CANNON, THE OTHER IN HERE WITH A 9. AND GET A LOAD OF THIS. THEY LEFT THE MERCHANDISE BEHIND. SOMEBODY'S GOT A SENSE OF HUMOR. WITH A PUNCH LINE. WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S THE SQUAD ROOM HOTLINE NUMBER. FOR POLICE USE ONLY. KIND OF STICKS A TONGUE IN YOUR EAR, DON'T IT? GENTLEMEN-- AND I USE THE TERM LIGHTLY. RON, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING HERE? OFFICIALLY, I'M EMPOWERED BY A FEDERAL MANDATE TO INVESTIGATE ANY DRUG-RELATED MURDER SCENE I WANT. UNOFFICIALLY, I THOUGHT YOU LOCAL GRUNTS MIGHT USE A LITTLE CLARITY AND EXPERTISE, THE KIND OF KNOW-HOW ONLY A TRULY ORGANIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CAN BRING TO A SITUATION. WHO'S THIS ASSHOLE? DETECTIVE LEPER, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE FEDERAL AGENT RONALD DACKHOUSE. DON'T SELL ME SHORT, JACK. I'M ASSISTANT HEAD OF MIDWEST OPERATIONS NOW. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE ROTTEN RONNIE. YOU'RE THE GUY WHO GOT BUSTED OUT OF WASHINGTON FOR DICKING SOME GENERAL'S DAUGHTER. SHE WASN'T ANYBODY'S DAUGHTER. SHE WAS A CONGRESSIONAL SECRETARY. RIGHT, WHO YOU HAPPENED TO GIVE THE DOSE TO. I WAS SET UP, VICTIMIZED BY THE ENVY AND INEPTITUDE OF THOSE DIRECTLY ABOVE ME. REALLY? I WAS MAKING MOVES, GETTING NOTICED. THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT. IT FRIGHTENED THEM. SO THEY WENT AFTER ME. THE SORT OF THING THAT ONLY HAPPENS IN A TRULY ORGANIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. - ARE YOU SURE YOU'LL BE OKAY? - YEAH. - ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD AND GET THE PAPERWORK STARTED. - OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT? MEETING YOU HAS REALLY MADE MY DAY. ( car door opens, closes ) - I'LL SEE YOU LATER, BERT. - OKAY, LEP. COME ON, WRAP IT UP. LET'S NOT MAKE A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF IT. WILLY, WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM WAS NEVER PART OF THE DEAL. YOU KNOW THAT. I SIMPLY SEE IT AS AN ISSUE OF RESPECT. I BROKER THE FUNDS TO YOU. YOU LAUNDER THE MONEY AND SET IT UP IN FOREIGN ACCOUNTS. IT'S A STRAIGHT 60/40 SPLIT OVER AND ABOVE YOUR EXPENSES. NOW, IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS, I'M SURE MY PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THEIR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. MARION, YOU'RE OVERREACTING. THAT'S ENOUGH, SUGAR. I'M SIMPLY EXPRESSING MY CONCERN OVER THE LATEST DELIVERY. WHICH IS? FIVE VERY DEAD BODIES LYING IN A LOCAL GRAVEL PIT. MARION, UNDERSTAND THIS: WHEN IT COMES TO THE MONEY, PLAY ALL THE GAMES YOU WANT, TELL ME YOU PULLED IT FROM THE ASS OF THE TOOTH FAIRY. I DON'T CARE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO KILLING-- THIS IS MY TOWN. I OWN IT. AND NOBODY DIES AROUND HERE UNLESS I SAY SO. NOW GO TELL THAT TO YOUR PEOPLE. I'LL MAKE THE CALL. THANK YOU. ( dialing ) HOW IS IT WITH YOU AND HER? WE HAVE DRINKS, HANG OUT-- THAT SORT OF THING, YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU GO TO WALTER'S STRIP JOINT, SEE IF YOU CAN'T GET HER TO TAG ALONG, MAYBE EVEN GET INVOLVED. - SUGAR. - YEAH, BOSS? DID YOU PICK UP THE DRY CLEANING? IT'S ALL LAID OUT JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT. EGGS AND HOT SAUCE. I'VE WORKED UP AN APPETITE. YOU GOT IT. ( sirens wailing ) - ( phones ringing ) - ( typewriter keys clacking ) FORENSICS SAYS THE CASH CAME IN THIS. EXACTLY HOW MUCH THEY DON'T KNOW, BUT THEIR GUESS IS A LOT. NOW, WHAT DO THEY CALL "A LOT"? 25, MAYBE 30 POUNDS. WELL, WE COULD HAVE THEM BREAK IT DOWN BY DENOMINATIONS-- YOU KNOW, A POUND'S WORTH OF 1s, 20s, 100s-- THAT SORT OF THING. DO IT. WHAT ABOUT THE HEROIN? IT'S BURMESE, PURE, OVER 40 KILOS, ITS STREET VALUE IN EXCESS OF $4 MILLION. YEAH, WE'VE GOT A POSITIVE I.D. ON ALL FIVE BODIES. THEY'RE ALL FROM OUT OF STATE-- THESE THREE FROM NEVADA, THESE TWO FROM NEW JERSEY. EVERY ONE HAS A SIZABLE RAP SHEET. YEAH, NOW, THIS GUY HERE, EDDIE FLEECE-- HE'S THE ONLY ONE WITH ANYTHING CURRENT-- A FEDERAL BENCH WARRANT OUT OF MIAMI, FLORIDA. EVIDENTLY HE JUMPED BAIL ON A POSSESSIONS CHARGE. SO THEY TAKE THE CASH AND WALK AWAY AND LEAVE $4 MILLION WORTH OF DRUGS LYING ON THE GROUND. I DON'T GET IT. WHO WALKS AWAY FROM A DOUBLE PAYDAY? SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR ABILITY TO CATCH THEM. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WELL, THEY DIDN'T CARE IF WE COULD I.D. THE BODIES OR NOT, AND OTHER THAN SOME OVER-THE-COUNTER SHELL CASINGS AND GENERIC TIRE PRINTS, DIDN'T LEAVE ONE PIECE OF HARD TRACEABLE EVIDENCE ON THE SITE-- VERY PROFESSIONAL. AND QUITE FRANKLY, THEY'RE LAUGHING AT US. WELL, I AM GLAD SOMEBODY'S AMUSED. BECAUSE EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THIS COUNTY IS CALLING THE D.A.'S OFFICE SCREAMING FOR ANSWERS. NOW, WE NEED SOME HELP-- HUNCHES, THEORIES, ANYTHING THAT'LL BUY US SOME BREATHING ROOM. WHAT ABOUT MORTON? WILLY MORTON? NO WAY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WILLY MORTON'S OPERATION IS THE ONLY ONE BIG ENOUGH IN TOWN TO PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS OFF. YEAH, INVESTMENT FRAUD, EXTORTION, PROSTITUTION-- YOU CAN'T TURN A CORNER WITHOUT STEPPING ON ONE OF HIS SCAMS. RIGHT. THIS IS NOT HIS STYLE. NOW, JACK, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW MORTON WOULD NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING WORTH $4 MILLION LYING IN THE DIRT. YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE'S RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. SEE YOU TOMORROW. TAKE CARE. THAT'S THE LAST ONE, MR. ENWRIGHT. THANK YOU, ABRAHAM. YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M GONNA BE STUCK HERE A LITTLE LONGER THAN I THOUGHT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT: WHY DON'T YOU GO ON AHEAD AND I'LL-- I'LL LOCK UP WHEN I'M DONE. ARE YOU SURE NOW? I DON'T MIND WAITING. NO, NO, I'LL BE FINE. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. THERE'S $2.8 MILLION IN THERE WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW MUCH AND WHICH ACCOUNTS MR. MORTON WANTS USED. OH. OH, THIS-- THIS IS EXCELLENT. UH-HUH. IS THAT BLOOD? IS THAT A PROBLEM? MY 15%. IT'S IN THERE. YOU-- YOU TELL MR. MORTON IT WAS A PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH HIM. YEAH. ( dialing ) IT'S ME. YEAH, HE'S RUNNING THE MONEY THROUGH A TRUST COMPANY DOWNTOWN. AND I'VE GOT HIS CONTACT. - ROGERS. - JENSEN. Jensen: SO... HOW'D THE BRIEFING GO? WHAT, AM I TALKING TO MYSELF HERE? DALE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND WE DIDN'T GIVE HER MUCH TO FIGHT BACK WITH. SO SHE GETS HER ASS KICKED. THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT BUILDS CHARACTER. BERT, STAY ON IT. DO THE BEST YOU CAN. YOU TWO, GET ONTO SOMETHING ELSE. I DON'T WANT EVERYBODY BOTTLED UP ON THE SAME CASE. OH, BY THE WAY, I HAD THE HOTLINE CHANGED, SO MAKE SURE YOU GRAB THE NEW NUMBER BEFORE HEADING OUT. THAT'S RATHER BLASE OF HIM, DON'T YOU THINK? I MEAN, CONSIDERING THE HEAT THIS CASE IS GETTING. HEY, BERT, IT'S ALL YOU, BUDDY. ( phone rings ) PRECINCT. JACK, LINE TWO. DETECTIVE CONNOR. YES, FATHER. WHAT DID HE DO THIS TIME? ARNOLD. YOU GOT IT. - OKAY, COME NOW. - ( church bell ringing ) - COME CLOSER. - ( back-up signal beeping ) NO, IT'S SAFE. COME TOWARDS ME. COME CLOSER NOW. A LITTLE MORE. OKAY, GOOD. POOR OLD THING. SHE'S ALWAYS BREAKING DOWN IN THE MOST INCONVENIENT OF PLACES. THANK YOU. SORRY TO INCONVENIENCE YOU. GENTLEMEN, THE SIMPLE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THE MATERIAL WORLD. THIS WAY, PLEASE. WE DIDN'T WANT HIM HURTING HIMSELF. THE LAUNDRY BAG SEEMED LIKE A PERFECT SOLUTION. THANK YOU, MARGARET. ( snoring, belches ) UGH. COME ON, ARNOLD, WAKEY-WAKEY. WHAT? COME ON. BLACK COFFEE SHOULD DO THE TRICK. ( sighs ) ( distant dance music playing ) I'VE GOT A LITTLE CASH PUT ASIDE-- NOTHING BIG, SOMETHING TO BUILD ON, SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE. - I WORK HARD FOR MY MONEY. - YES, YOU DO. I DON'T TRICK. I'VE NEVER DONE A VIDEO. I DRAW THE LINE AT SHAKING MY BUTT IN SOMEBODY'S LAP. THOSE NEW? YEAH, THEY'RE CUTTING ME TO THE BONE. THOSE ARE HOT. ARE YOU GONNA DANCE TONIGHT? FOURTH OUT. YOU? LATER. WALTER'S GOT ME SHAKING CHAIRS MOST OF THE EVENING. WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT SMOKING IN THE CLUB? A FIRE MARSHAL WALKS IN, I'M OUT OF A LICENSE. YOU WANT TO SMOKE... All: DO IT ON THE STAIRS. I'M GOING TO THE STAIRS. ( dance music continues ) WAIT. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY LISTEN UP. SHUT THAT OFF. IF YOU'RE LAP DANCING IN THE MAIN ROOM, REMEMBER, PANTIES AND BRAS AT ALL TIMES. DO NOT TAKE THEM OFF. IT IS THE LAW. CARRY ON. ( horns honking ) - HEY. - COBB, THE DOORS OPEN IN A HALF-HOUR. IT'S OKAY. WALTER AROUND? YEAH, HE'S IN THE BACK. GO ON THROUGH. THANKS. CAUGHT YOUR DANCE LAST NIGHT. WHAT DID YOU THINK? YOU GOT MOVES. YOU'RE JUST VERY, UM, LADYLIKE. LADYLIKE? YEAH, YOU-- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE-- YOU'RE NOT CHEAP. YOU'RE LIKE A LADY. OKAY, LIKE ME-- SEE, I GOTTA SHAKE IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND THEN RIDE IT ON HOME. - ( both laugh ) - YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? - ( door opens ) - YEAH, I AIN'T NO LADY. Walter: SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH? HOW'S THIS? IS THIS PRIVATE ENOUGH FOR YOU? SURE. WILLY WANTS YOU TO RECONSIDER HIS OFFER. HOW MANY TIMES YOU GOTTA HEAR IT, HUH? MY CLUB'S NOT FOR SALE. SURE ABOUT THAT? COBB, DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK. WATCH THE DOOR. STAND HIM UP. YOU LOOK NICE, WALTER. Cobb: LET'S GO. AFTER YOU. SEE YOU AROUND, WALTER. Leper: COME ON. COME ON, ARNOLD. JUST GET IN THE CAR, BUDDY. WHO DOES YOUR TAXES? YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT'S GOT CYBER LOOPHOLES IN THERE BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO DROP A BUICK THROUGH. I'M YOUR GUY. I CAN FIX YOU UP. WAIT A MINUTE, I GOT A CARD HERE FOR YOU. HERE'S YOUR SHOES. ( retching ) ( retching ) Father Kirby: ARNOLD HAS A GOD-GIVEN GIFT WITH COMPUTERS. HE SIMPLIFIED OUR ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES. HE DESIGNED THIS MIRACULOUS COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH ACTUALLY ALLOWS US TO PUT ASIDE A FEW DOLLARS EACH MONTH. AND IN TIME, GOD WILLING, WE MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO BUY A NEW BUS. FATHER, HE'S A DRUNK. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE HURTS HIMSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE. LOOK, ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT YOU KEEP HIM OVERNIGHT. IN THE MORNING, I'LL CALL AROUND AND GET HIM INTO ONE OF THE LOCAL RECOVERY CENTERS. WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. YES, WE HAVE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ABOUT DINNER? I'LL SIGN US OUT. HEY, GUYS, TAKE A LOOK. ( lighter clicks ) - WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE? - I DON'T KNOW. SO... ARE YOU TWO UP TO SERVING A COUPLE OF WARRANTS? - WHAT, NOW? TONIGHT? - ON WHO? OH, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS ONE. YEAH. ( Cobb chuckles ) DAMN IT. DAMN. Willy: NO APPETITE? I LOST IT EARLIER. AH, YES, THE HANGING. I MUST APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. BUT I DO FIND YOU EASIER TO TRUST WITH AN ACCESSORY TO MURDER CHARGE HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD. IT WAS STUPID, CLUMSY. AND I'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TELL YOU THAT IF YOU TRY ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN, IT'S OVER. OUR ARRANGEMENT WILL CEASE TO EXIST. YOU'RE UP. YOU'RE GONNA NEED CASH. HE AIN'T TAKING NOTHING IN TRADE. I GOT THAT. HEY. DON'T SWEAT IT. MY, MY, MY, LOOK AT THIS-- MR. BIG AND ONE OF HIS LITTLE TURDS OUT ON THE TOWN TOGETHER. OH! HUH? AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA USE THIS FOR? OH, IT'S-- NOW, LADIES, UNLESS YOUR PAPERS ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPECCABLE, I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A WALK RIGHT NOW. IS THIS ONE OF YOUR PLACES, MORTON? I HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT, YES. YOU HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN A LOT OF THINGS AROUND TOWN, DON'T YOU? IT'S CALLED "FREE ENTERPRISE," DETECTIVE. PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF IT. YEAH, WELL, WHAT I'VE HEARD IS YOU'RE A SCUMBAG SLOB, A KIND OF SOCIAL DISEASE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS GONE. YOU'D BETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH, COP. SHUT UP, SUGAR. IS THIS JUVENILE HARASSMENT LEADING SOMEWHERE, DETECTIVE? YOU CROSSED THE LINE TONIGHT. DID I? YEAH. YOU'RE GOING DOWN, WILLY. WELL, PERHAPS YOU'D CARE TO TALK TO MY ATTORNEYS. NAH, THAT'S NOT MY JOB. - GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR. - WHAT? I SAID GET ON THE FLOOR NOW. THIS PRICK'S WAY OUT OF LINE. NOW, I HAVE NOT HAD WHAT I'D CALL A RED-LETTER DAY. AND PUTTING A HOLE IN YOU JUST MIGHT TURN IT AROUND. - OKAY. - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, I WILL TAKE THIS ONE... HER... AND YOU. WHAT'S THE CHARGE? - MURDER. - BULLSHIT. YEAH? WELL, WE'VE GOT AN EYEWITNESS. IS THAT RIGHT? GET UP, COME ON. COME ON. GET HIM OUT OF HERE. FEELS GOOD, HUH? LIKE HITTING A HOME RUN. LET'S JUST GO BOOK THEM. INDICTING MORTON'S A SLAM DUNK. WE NAIL COBB AND THE OTHERS, AND WILLY IS JUST A SIGNATURE AWAY. ALL WE NEED NOW IS THE EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY. SHE IS HERE, ISN'T SHE, JACK? WELL, ACTUALLY, SHE'S-- ACTUALLY, THAT'S HER RIGHT THERE. I APOLOGIZE. TOOK FOREVER TO FIND PARKING. DALE, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET OFFICER RACHEL HENDERSON, CURRENTLY ON LOAN TO VICE. - YOU'RE UNDERCOVER? - NOTHING FANCY. A ROUTINE FOLLOW-UP ON A PROSTITUTION BUST. EVER BEEN BEFORE A GRAND JURY? UH, ONCE A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. EXCUSE ME. SHE'S A GOOD OFFICER. ( laughs ) OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? UH, I HEARD YOU WERE GOING TO TESTIFY, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD COME AND, YOU KNOW, JUST KEEP YOU COMPANY. ARE YOU HERE TO TESTIFY? NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE THIS WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA. - WAIT A MINUTE. - I-- LOOK AT THE WAY I'M DRESSED AND LOOK AT THE WAY YOU'RE DRESSED. I'M A COP. WHAT, YOU MEAN, LIKE FULL-TIME? LIKE EVEN WHEN YOU WERE...

ANDY, I NEED YOU TO GET DOWN TO FORENSICS, GET ME THAT BALLISTICS REPORT. PUT A FLAME UNDER THEIR ASS. TELL THEM I DON'T CARE HOW LATE IT GOES. DID YOU TALK TO THAT DOORMAN? CANDY, RACHEL-- NEVER HEARD OF EITHER ONE OF THEM. - WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? - THEY'RE LIKE HIM. THEY'RE SCARED SHITLESS. NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING. YEAH. YOU CAN'T HOLD THEM ON THAT. THAT'S A MISDEMEANOR. I UNDERSTAND, YEAH. THE D.A.'S OFFICE. THEY'RE LETTING MORTON'S PEOPLE GO. WHAT? WHEN? WHEN COURT OPENS IN THE MORNING.

THIS IS AGENT HELLER FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE BEEN ORDERED TO GIVE HER FULL ACCESS AND COOPERATION IN THE HENDERSON MURDER CASE. CAPTAIN, RACHEL WAS ONE OF US. WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT. WHAT THE HELL DOES THE STATE DEPARTMENT WANT WITH RACHEL'S MURDER? WE DON'T HAVE A SAY IN THIS ONE, JACK. THIS DIRECTIVE'S RIGHT OUT OF WASHINGTON. I DIDN'T ASK WHO SENT HER. I WANT TO KNOW WHY SHE'S HERE. - DETECTIVE CONNOR, RIGHT? - THAT'S RIGHT. OFFICER HENDERSON WAS A KEY WITNESS IN A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION-- A WITNESS YOU LOST. SHE WAS MY FRIEND. HEY, HEY, HEY, GO WALK IT OFF RIGHT NOW. WE'LL GIVE YOU OUR FULL COOPERATION, AND I MEAN OUR FULL COOPERATION. BERT, CLEAR A DESK OFF FOR HER. THIS WAY. HEY. LOUISA MAY WALLENBERG. - WHO? - CANDY WELCH. I KNOW HER. AND I KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER. ALL RIGHT. ( pager beeping ) IS IT ASKING TOO MUCH THAT ONCE, JUST ONCE SOMEBODY IN THIS DEPARTMENT ANSWERS A PAGE? - DETECTIVE HERSHAK. - HMM? THIS SUSPECT, CANDY WELCH-- WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON HER? NOTHING MUCH. MOSTLY HEARSAY. UH, CANDY WELCH IS AN ALIAS. THE FILE IS ON MY DESK. GO AND GET IT FOR HER. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU, HUH? I UNDERSTAND. DETECTIVES CONNOR AND LEPER-- WHERE ARE THEY?

YOU SAID YOU WANTED SOMETHING LOW-PROFILE. I SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION. SHE AIN'T THE SHOOTER. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? I TOLD YOU I KNOW HER. YOU SAW HER RAP SHEET. IT'S ALL VICE CONVICTIONS. YOU'RE SURE SHE'S OUT HERE, HUH? YEAH. JUST FEELS RIGHT. HER FATHER'S A REAL TOE-THE-LINE, TYPE-A PERSONALITY. HE'LL BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. - ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS? - YEAH. LET'S DO THIS RIGHT, THEN. ( rock music playing ) ( distant cows mooing ) ( music playing louder ) LOU. ( music stops ) HI. THAT FOR ME? OH, I APOLOGIZE FOR JUST WALKING IN. I HALF EXPECTED YOUR FATHER TO JUMP DOWN MY THROAT. WELL, HE'S BEEN DEAD FOR OVER FOUR YEARS. OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. THIS USED TO BE HIS ROOM. NOW IT'S MY ROOM. THIS WHOLE PLACE IS MINE. LOU, I GOTTA ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS. THAT LADY TREATED ME REAL DECENT, BETTER THAN MOST. BUT I WAS OUTSIDE ON THE ROOF HAVING A CIGARETTE WHEN IT HAPPENED. I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING. SO YOU CAN GO BACK OUT THE WAY YOU CAME IN. I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE. THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING HER ARE THE SAME BUNCH WHO HUNG YOUR BOSS AT THE CLUB. YOU WERE THERE. YOU SAW THEM DO IT. IT WAS IN THE REPORT. LOU, WE'LL PUT YOU IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY. WE'LL GIVE YOU AROUND-THE-CLOCK POLICE PROTECTION. SHE WAS A COP. THEY KILLED HER.

GET OUT NOW. LOU, I KNOW YOU CARED ABOUT RACHEL. THAT'S WHY YOU CAME TO THE COURTHOUSE, ISN'T IT? RACHEL? CHRIST, I DIDN'T KNOW HER REAL NAME. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT? YOU TWO MUST JUST THINK I'M A HORSE'S ASS OR SOMETHING. CAN'T PROTECT ONE OF YOUR OWN. - WHAT THE HELL KIND OF CHANCE I GOT? - ( phone ringing ) SHIT. HELLO. YES. NO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHO THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO? WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT'S SOME LOCAL PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS THE PHONE COMPANY. OH, THEY'RE WORKING ON YOUR LINE DOWN ON THE ROAD. I DON'T HAVE A LINE. THAT WAS MY FATHER'S LINE, AND HE'S DEAD. NOBODY KNOWS I'M HERE-- THAT IS, UNTIL YOU TWO SHOWED UP. ( tapping phone ) THE TRUCK'S GONE AND THE LINE IS DEAD. YOU'RE TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME, AREN'T YOU? - AREN'T YOU? - ( gunshot ) ( gunshots ) STAY DOWN. STAY DOWN. IN THE CORNER. - ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU OKAY? - YEAH, YEAH. UH-HUH. - ANYTHING? - NOTHING.

IT LEADS OUT BACK. - ( glass shatters ) - ( beeping ) ( glass shatters ) IT'S GOT FIVE BEDROOMS, A JACUZZI, A BEAUTIFUL VIEW, A COUPLE OF ACRES OF PROPERTY. IT'S NOT LIKE THEM TO MISS. DO YOU REALLY THINK HE NEEDS TO KNOW? WELL, PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S TIME TO MOVE SHOP. WILLY. THE WIRE TRANSFER-- WHEN DOES IT GO THROUGH? AT THE MOMENT I'M FLIPPING SOME REAL ESTATE BETWEEN HOLDING COMPANIES. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, WITH THE KIND OF NUMBERS WE'RE DEALING WITH-- WHEN DOES IT GO THROUGH? AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS TOMORROW. DID YOU GET THAT? UNDERSTOOD. I'LL KEEP MY EYE ON HIM. ( phone rings ) Man: BERT, IT'S FOR YOU. YEAH? YOU? I-- I MEAN, IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S YOU. YEAH, SURE I'M COOL. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? AND LEPER? YOU KNOW, THEY'RE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WITH DENTAL RECORDS SIFTING THROUGH THE RUBBLE. YEAH-- YEAH, SURE. I-- I CAN GET THAT. WHERE? YEAH, OKAY, YOU GOT IT. ( distant dog barking ) ( cat mews ) RIGHT HERE. MAKE IT QUICK. I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF GATHERING A FEW TOILETRIES AND SOME FRESH LINENS FOR THE YOUNG LADY. IT'S BASICALLY OFF-LIMITS TO ALL BUT THE PRIESTS AND THE SISTERS. AH. YOU QUITE LITERALLY HAVE THE RUN OF THIS PLACE. THIS WAY. NOW, IT'S QUITE A WHILE SINCE I WAS DOWN HERE. AH. IT'LL BE THROUGH HERE. THERE'S NO LOCK ON THE DOOR. BUT NOT TO WORRY, YOU'LL BE TOTALLY SAFE DOWN HERE. WHEN THE NEED ARISES, WE FIND THIS A WONDERFUL RESPITE FOR SOLITUDE AND MEDITATION. FEELS LIKE A JAIL. IT'S-- IT'S GREAT, FATHER. SO, DOES A BATHROOM COME WITH ALL THIS? OF COURSE. THERE'S A BOX SHOWER AND A COMMODE JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOILER ROOM. EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU, FATHER. THAT WAS RUDE. SO SHOOT ME. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THIS? YEAH. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO IF YOU TWO DON'T COME BACK? IF WE DON'T COME BACK, GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE AS YOU CAN. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WON'T JUST TAKE OFF? LOU, LISTEN. YOU'RE A MATERIAL WITNESS IN A MULTIPLE MURDER CASE. THE FEDS KNOW ABOUT YOU. MORTON AND HIS BUNCH KNOW ABOUT YOU. THIS AIN'T GONNA GO AWAY. PUTTING THEM BEHIND BARS IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS FOR EVERYONE. LISTEN TO ME. I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SEE YOU THROUGH THIS. YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME I CUT YOUR HAIR? ( chuckles ) MADE YOU LOOK KIND OF HANDSOME. LOU, WITHOUT YOU, WE DON'T HAVE A CASE. NO KIDDING. ( distant siren wailing ) ( honks horn ) JACK? JACK. WE WERE SET UP, BERT. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? THE CAPTAIN CORNERED ME. WHEN I TOLD HIM YOU WENT FOR THE GIRL, HE BLEW HIS TOP. EVERYBODY HEARD EVERYTHING. ANYONE AT THE STATION HOUSE COULD HAVE SET YOU UP. SO WHERE IS LEPER? DID YOU BRING THAT SCANNER I ASKED FOR? - IT'S IN THE TRUNK. - THE KEYS. SO WHERE'S LEPER? WITH THE GIRL? OKAY, LOOK, JACK, I GOTTA SAY SOMETHING HERE. MAYBE I SCREWED UP BY NOT LYING, BUT 10 YEARS OF PUNCHING THE SAME CLOCK TOGETHER HAS GOT TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING. NOW, EITHER YOU TRUST ME OR YOU DON'T. WHAT'S IT GONNA BE? COME ON OUT. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND. HEY, BERT. I HIT YOUR LOCKERS ON THE WAY IN, GRABBED YOU SOME FRESH SHIRTS. THEY'RE IN ON THE BACK SEAT. HOW'S YOUR LITTLE DANCER? DID SHE MAKE IT OKAY? HER NAME'S LOU. SHE'S GONNA BE FINE. BERT, I NEED YOU TO RUN A CHECK ON EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN AND AROUND MORTON'S ORGANIZATION WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FEMALE, EUROPEAN ACCENT, POSSIBLY SLAVIC. WHO IS SHE? SHE'S THE SHOOTER THAT KILLED RACHEL. ALL RIGHT. ( humming ) WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? OH, YOUR BASIC BLACK AND WHITE. YEAH, RIGHT. YOU GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS? NO, I DIDN'T THINK SO. ( sighs ) DON'T TURN AROUND, CAPTAIN. IS THIS YOUR IDEA OF A JOKE? PEOPLE SHOOTING AT YOU, TRYING TO BLOW YOU UP AIN'T FUNNY. WHERE'S LEPER? HE'S ALIVE. AND THE GIRL? HOW DO I KNOW TELLING YOU WON'T PUT A BULLET IN HER HEAD? THAT AIN'T RIGHT. If you want to be trusted, Captain, you find out who set us up. Then maybe we'll consider it, not before. ( dialing ) DID IT WORK? HE'S MAKING A CALL. OKAY, HERE WE GO. IT'S ME. Woman: Where are you? IN THE CAR. Woman: It's late. Something's wrong. ARE WE GETTING THIS? Jensen: I can't remember what it was you wanted me to pick up. Woman: Butter and eggs. Jensen: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Woman: That's your worried voice. Are you all right? Jensen: A couple of my guys are in trouble-- good men. I feel like I let them down. I don't know. Woman: Why don't you just come home? Jensen: No, no, no, I'll stop, pick up the butter and eggs. WELL, I FEEL LIKE A TOTAL ASSHOLE. YEAH, HERE HE COMES. WOW. WHAT IF IT AIN'T ONE OF US, RIGHT? WHAT IF IT'S A UNIFORM OR SOME CLOWN IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE? WE CAN'T TAP EVERYBODY. NO, WE CAN'T. IT'S TIME WE FOUND OUT IF SHE'S EVEN WILLING TO SHOW UP OR NOT. YOU GOTTA TALK TO HER. - ALL RIGHT? - ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. ( speaking Russian ) IS SHE INSIDE? YOUR FRIEND? NO. IS SHE NOT IN THE ROOM? I LOOKED EVERYWHERE. I CAN'T FIND HER. - I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D TAKE OFF. - WHAT? IS THAT-- IS THAT MAN WITH YOU? ( light switches click ) AIN'T THIS SORT OF THING ILLEGAL IN A CHURCH? ( exhales ) LOUISA, GOODNESS. YOU'RE HARDLY RECOGNIZABLE IN THOSE CLOTHES. ANYBODY UP FOR PIZZA? IF I REMEMBER RIGHT, IT'S DOUBLE CHEESE, DOUBLE SAUCE, AND-- AND ONIONS. I EAT ONIONS NOW. OOH, TOO BAD. YOU DIDN'T GET ANY. HOW ABOUT YOU, FATHER? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME PIZZA? A SNACK WOULD BE NICE. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? NOTHING. I WAS JUST WORRIED, THAT'S ALL. BUT IN A PROFESSIONAL KIND OF WAY, RIGHT? LIKE THE WAY A COP WORRIES? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ANSWER THAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU? THAT IT'S JUST A JOB? WELL, I CAN'T SAY THAT. WELL, JUST DON'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY. FOR WHAT? FOR CHEATING ON ME. I WASN'T CHEATING ON YOU. I WAS CHEATING ON THE OTHER GIRL. MONICA. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT-- MONICA. - MONICA. - THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE WERE JUST KIDS. I WAS JUST A KID. I DIDN'T KNOW MY ASS FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND. AND BESIDES, WHAT'S WRONG WITH APOLOGIZING? WHAT'S WRONG WITH TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS? SORRY? YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I'M SORRY. AREN'T YOU? SORRY FOR WHAT? FOR WHAT WE COULD HAVE HAD. YOU AND I COULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING GREAT TOGETHER. JESUS, DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES ALL IN A BUNCH. LOOK, KEEP YOUR STUPID MONEY. I AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE. WE'RE HAVING PIZZA, RIGHT, FATHER? LOU. LOU, I PROMISE YOU I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU. OKAY. COULD I JUST-- COULD I JUST HAVE A HUG? I'M GONNA GO TO BED. ( phone dials ) WE KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE HER. IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM. ( glass clinks ) I'M SORRY, SISTER. THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL. ( groans ) ( church bells ringing ) COFFEE. - ( door opens ) - THANK YOU. DO YOU PRAY? NO. BUT YOU USED TO, RIGHT? MY WIFE WAS THE RELIGIOUS ONE. AFTER SHE DIED, I HAD NO USE FOR IT. Leper: I MEAN, PRAYER'S JUST ASKING FOR HELP. HOW BAD CAN THAT BE? ADMITTING YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN HAS GOT AN UPSIDE TO IT, RIGHT? WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? NOBODY. OH, JESUS. FRANCIS, IT LIFTS MY HEART TO SEE YOU SITTING THERE. YEAH, WELL, THE PEWS ARE JUST AS HARD AS I REMEMBER THEM. HE STREET LEGAL? I OWE YOU AN AMENDS. FOR WHAT? PUKING IN YOUR CAR. WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK. IT'S STILL THERE. I'LL BRING IT BY SOMETIME. YOU CAN CLEAN IT UP. OKAY. I'D BETTER GO SEE IF I CAN'T GET OUR COMPUTER TO FIRE UP. THANK YOU. AND I'D BETTER GO CHECK ON THE PIZZA QUEEN, SEE IF SHE'S UP AND AROUND YET. WHAT? IT'S AN UNMANAGEABLE WORLD, FRANCIS. SOMETIMES A LITTLE FORGIVENESS GOES A LONG WAY. AND I BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY WHEN THEY SCREW UP. OH, THAT'S ODD. OUR SISTERS WEAR A BLACK VEIL. VEIL? OH, THE HEADPIECE. SHE MUST BE A NEW ARRIVAL. SHE CAME IN WITH A PRIEST. REALLY? YEAH, HE'S BACK THERE SOMEWHERE. THAT'S VERY STRANGE. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE ON MY OWN THIS MORNING. LOU? I'M SORRY, FATHER. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU SOMEBODY'S USING THIS ROOM. SHE'S-- SHE'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. LOU? LOU. ( Louisa whispers ) OVER HERE. LOU? OVER HERE. WHAT'S GOING ON? ( muffled gunshots ) ( gun clicks ) ( cocks gun ) ( grunts ) ( gunshots ) LEPER? Louisa: JACK! YOU, THERE. COVER THE STAIRS. GET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL THERE. - LEPER? - TOOK ONE OFF THE SIDE OF THE HEAD, ONE IN THE STOMACH. - ( Louisa crying ) - ( heart monitor beeping ) ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY FOR HIM. LET'S GET MOVING. - Man: A LITTLE ROOM, PLEASE. - Man #2: LET'S GO. - WHERE IS HE--? - THEY'RE TAKING HIM TO HELP HIM. Man: COMING THROUGH. DOC. WE'LL KNOW MORE ONCE WE GET HIM INTO SURGERY. ( Louisa crying ) WHERE DID HE GO? HE WON'T WAKE UP. - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. - IT'S MY FAULT, 'CAUSE-- LOOK, DON'T EVEN GO THERE. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GET YOURSELF CLEANED UP. I'M NOT LEAVING. WHEN HE WAKES UP, AND HE WILL, HE'S GONNA NEED TO SEE YOU SAFE AND SOUND. ALL RIGHT? NOW, BERT, FIND HER SOMEWHERE TO CLEAN UP. GO WITH HIM NOW. COME ON, MISS WALLENBERG. Jensen: DON'T YOU DARE PULL JURISDICTION ON ME. THAT WITNESS SHOULD BE IN A FEDERALLY GUARDED SAFE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. HOW I RUN THIS DEPARTMENT IS NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS. I HAVE ABSOLUTE FAITH IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE MEN WHO WORK UNDERNEATH ME, ESPECIALLY CONNOR AND LEPER. GOOD, BECAUSE THEY'RE WALKING ONE HELL OF A TIGHTROPE, AND YOU'RE RIGHT OUT THERE WITH THEM. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I AM. ( phone rings ) NO, I'M ALONE. BOTH OF THEM? DID THEY GET IT DONE? NO, I AGREE. I'LL SEE IF I CAN HURRY THINGS ALONG. Woman over P.A.: Paging Dr. Stamos. Dr. Stamos, please. WELL, THERE WAS A LOT OF HEMORRHAGING, A LACERATED KIDNEY THAT COULDN'T BE SAVED, BUT HE'S STABLE. AND BARRING ANY FURTHER COMPLICATIONS, HE SHOULD BE OKAY. - WHAT ABOUT THE HEAD WOUND? - A MINOR FRACTURE, A LACERATION ABOVE THE HAIRLINE. HE'S PROBABLY GOT ONE HELL OF A HEADACHE. - IS HE AWAKE? - YEAH. HEY. ARE YOU OKAY? STOP THAT. WHERE IS HE GOING? I.C.U., THIRD FLOOR. YOU GO WITH HIM. Woman over P.A.: Dr. Bender, please. Dr. Bender. HEY, JACK. LOOK. SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR PARTNER. YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE HE'S ALREADY DEAD. BY ALL RIGHTS HE SHOULD BE; YOU AND THE WOMAN, TOO. OLGA ROSLOW AND HER BROTHER SERGEI-- TWO OF THE K.G.B.'S FINEST. MID-'80s THEY WERE TAGGED AS SECURITY STAFF AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN HELSINKI. IN REALITY, THEY WERE A WET WORK TEAM WITH OVER 16 CONFIRMED KILLS, EVERY HIT A HIGH-RISK TARGET. - DID YOU SAY HELSINKI? - THAT'S RIGHT. - WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING HERE? - SOMEBODY HIRED THEM. - WHO? - DON'T KNOW. WE WERE RATHER HOPING YOU COULD BIRD-DOG THAT FOR US. COME ON, BE STRAIGHT WITH US. WHAT THE HELL DOES THE STATE DEPARTMENT WANT WITH ALL THIS? SOMEONE SOMEWHERE SCREWED UP. THOSE DRUGS YOU FOUND AT THE GRAVEL PIT WENT MISSING FROM A STATE EVIDENCE LOCKUP IN SAN FRANCISCO TWO MONTHS AGO. AND BALLISTICS TIES THE HEAD WOUND FROM THE GRAVEL PIT TO THE GUN THAT KILLED OFFICER HENDERSON AT THE COURTHOUSE. - THE RUSSIAN BROAD. - EXACTLY. - SO MORTON IS TIED TO THE DRUGS? - MAYBE. - THIS HAPPENED BEFORE, HASN'T IT? - WHAT? EVIDENCE GOES MISSING IN ONE PLACE, SHOWS UP SOMEPLACE ELSE FOR SALE. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE, ISN'T IT? YOU THINK IT'S ONE OF US. YOU THINK IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT? I'M HERE TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT THING GETS DONE, THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED. - JUSTICE? - EXACTLY. LOOK, I RAN THAT CHECK ON ALL OF MORTON'S PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR AN ACCENT. YEAH, THAT OLGA WOMAN KILLED RACHEL. MM-HMM, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE. MARION MARKEL, EX-ARMY, DID A FULL TOUR OF EMBASSY DUTY IN HELSINKI. - WHEN? - MID-'80s, RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OUR TWO RUSSIANS WERE THERE. AND HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT FIT. REMEMBER HELLER SAID THE DRUGS ARE OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO? WELL, MEET DETECTIVE JOSEPH LUSKY, ONE OF SAN FRAN'S FINEST. - WHERE IS THIS? - ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO, A MOTEL OUT NEAR THE AIRPORT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS BLOWING SMOKE UP OUR ASS. UH-HUH. BOY, I WOULD LOVE TO WANDER AROUND IN THEIR MAINFRAME SECURITY FILES. ( keyboard keys clicking ) ( whistles ) THEY'VE GOT SECURITY UP THE WAZOO. MORE ENCRYPTION CODE. NO, IT'S AN EXTREMELY NARROW GATE. THE ONLY WAY IN IS A 10-STROKE CIPHER. - A WHAT? - A PASSWORD, LIKE A SECURITY KEY. THE CHARACTER COMBINATIONS OFF A STANDARD KEYBOARD ARE ASTRONOMICAL, THAT EVEN WITH A SAMPLING PROGRAM, IT WOULD TAKE ME WEEKS, MAYBE EVEN MONTHS TO CRACK THIS. TRY "WASHINGTON." IT'LL WORK. "WASHINGTON"-- TRY IT. - IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. - DO IT. GO AHEAD, DO IT. OH, MY GOD, WE'RE IN. ♪ OUR COUNTRY, 'TIS OF THEE. ♪ THAT'S SCARY. I DIDN'T THINK NOTHING OF IT TILL I SAW HIM AGAIN IN THE NEWSPAPER-- THAT MAN THERE. THAT'S WHEN I WENT BACK AND TOOK A SECOND LOOK AT THE TAPE. THIS COULD COST ME MY JOB, BUT IF IT'S ABOUT THAT GIRL GETTING KILLED AT THE COURTHOUSE, I GOTTA DO IT. TRY CROSS-REFERENCING HER TOUR OF DUTY WITH TRAVEL VISAS, EMBASSY PERSONNEL, THAT SORT OF THING. JACK. STAY WITH IT, GUYS. WHAT'S THIS WOMAN'S NAME AGAIN? MARION MARKEL. Jensen: OKAY, HERE IT IS. YEAH, THAT'S COBB, ALL RIGHT. Connor: WHO'S THE OTHER GUY? THAT'S PETER ENWRIGHT. HE'S THE ASSISTANT MANAGER. WHERE DID THE BAG GO? HERE, STOP IT. RUN IT BACK. FREEZE IT. WHERE'S THE BAG? IT'S A DROP. HUH? HOW MANY POUNDS OF CASH DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET IN A BAG THIS SIZE? 25-30 POUNDS? - THE DRUG MONEY? - YEAH. LOOK AT THE DATE AND TIME-- THE SAME 24-HOUR PERIOD. - THAT'S A STRETCH. - IT'S A STRETCH? IT'S A TRUST COMPANY. YOU THINK HE'S DROPPING OFF DIRTY LAUNDRY? DIRTY LAUND-- OH, SON OF A BITCH. IT'S THE MONEY. MORTON'S LAUNDERING MONEY. NO, NO, WAIT. GO BACK TO THAT LAST SCREEN. YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S IT. JUST HOLD IT THERE. ARNOLD, CAN YOU ACCESS BANK RECORDS? THAT'S ILLEGAL. THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED YOU. YEAH, I CAN DO IT. I'D NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS STUFF AND DO A LITTLE RECONFIGURING. GO FOR IT. I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE I NEED TO CHECK OUT. OPERATOR, I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COLLECT CALL TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS ANYTHING WITH WILLY MORTON'S NAME ON IT. ALL THE ACCOUNTS ARE NUMBERED. WITHOUT AN INDEX, I CAN'T TELL WHO OWNS WHAT. WAIT A MINUTE. THEY'RE CLOSED, RIGHT? YES, SO WHAT? SO WE'VE GOT ACTIVITY. YEAH, SOMEBODY'S SETTING UP A WIRE TRANSFER. SEND IT. DO IT NOW. WHEW-- THERE IT GOES. CAN YOU TRACK THAT? SURE. UH, MAIN BRANCH, 1st ROYAL BANK, GRAND CAYMAN ISLANDS. SETTING UP ANOTHER ONE. IT'S MORTON. ( chuckles ) THIS IS WONDERFUL. AFTER WE'VE TRANSFERRED ALL MY ACCOUNTS, LET'S TAKE A LITTLE STROLL THROUGH SOME OF YOUR COMPANY'S CORPORATE HOLDINGS. YOU-- YOU CAN'T DO THAT. CAREFUL. WE NEED HIM CONSCIOUS AND ALERT. HE'S GOT ALL THOSE DELICIOUS ACCOUNT NUMBERS STORED UP IN YOUR HEAD. PUT HIM BACK IN HIS CHAIR. GET UP. NEXT ACCOUNT. THERE'S OVER $2 MILLION IN THIS ONE. IT'S THE SAME TRANSIT NUMBER, THE SAME ACCOUNT IN THE CAYMANS. CAN YOU DIVERT IT? UH, SURE. WHERE TO? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, THE MONEY'S GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE. I NEED A LOCATION, AN ACCOUNT IN A BANK, A BROKERAGE, A TRUST COMPANY-- ANYTHING. THEY'RE GONNA SEND IT. PARISH CHECKING ACCOUNTS. OUR PARISH? THE CHURCH? YES. DO IT. GO ON, DO IT. I'D APPRECIATE ANYTHING YOU CAN GET FOR ME ON THAT. RIGHT. HANG ON. HERE, RUN THIS FOR ME, TOO. AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP THIS ONE ON THE Q.T. - DID IT WORK? - IT'S IN THERE. - JACK. - THEY'RE SETTING UP ANOTHER ONE. ANYTHING THEY TRY AND WIRE-- YOU JUST STICK IT IN THE CHURCH ACCOUNTS. LOOK AT THIS. HEAD OF EMBASSY SECURITY, MARCH '84 TILL OCTOBER '86. AT THE SAME TIME THAT MARKEL WOMAN WAS THERE. ROTATED HOME AND TRANSFERRED OUT IN '87. I CALLED IN A MARKER, HAD A FRIEND FAX HIS SERVICE RECORD. HE SPENT TIME ON A NATIONAL TASK FORCE WITH FIELD WORK IN FRISCO AND FLORIDA. HE WAS EDDIE FLEECE'S ARRESTING OFFICER IN MIAMI. AND LOOK WHO POSTED FLEECE'S BAIL. MARION MARKEL. AND SHE AIN'T WORKING FOR MORTON. NO, SHE'S WORKING FOR HIM. HE'S IN THE TRUST COMPANY. HE'S GOT COBB WITH HIM. SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THIS? ( beeps ) YOU STILL THERE? Man: NO, I'M RIGHT HERE. ( gasps ) ( groans ) WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT NEVER GOT THERE? I MEAN THE LAST TWO TRANSACTIONS ARE GONE. - WHERE? - I DON'T KNOW. YOU'VE GOT TWO MINUTES TO FIND MY MONEY. IF YOU DON'T, KILL HIM. HEY, YOU WANT TO DIE? HUH? NO, NO. LOOK, LOOK, THIS IS NOT MY FAULT. LESS THAN TWO MINUTES. I-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN WITH THIS. JUST DO IT. ( phone buzzing ) I REALLY SHOULD GET THAT. YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. ( phone buzzing ) GET IT. GET IT. PICK IT UP. THIS IS PETER ENWRIGHT TALKING. IT'S FOR YOU. BULLSHIT. NOBODY KNOWS I'M HERE. WELL, THEY'RE ASKING FOR COBB. TAKE IT. GIVE ME THE PHONE. COBB. REALLY? AND WHO ARE YOU? HELLO? SOME JOKER, SAYS SUGAR'S LAYING FOR US ON THE CORNER. HE'S WHAT? YEAH, HE'S GONNA WHACK US WHEN WE WALK OUT THE DOOR. WHO WAS IT? I DON'T KNOW. CHECK IT OUT. GO, DO IT. AND YOU-- YOU GET BACK TO WORK. Cobb: WILLY. SOMEBODY'S SCREWING US OVER, MAN. THERE AIN'T NOBODY OUT HERE. ( gunshots ) - ( gunshot ) - ( grunts ) ( phone buzzing ) PETER ENWRIGHT SPEAKING. IT'S FOR YOU THIS TIME. WHO IS THIS? IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME COMPANY. ( door opens ) ( gun clicks ) Morton: LOOK AT YOU-- OUR GOVERNMENT IN ACTION. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I WAS DEALING WITH ONE OF YOUR KIND. MY KIND? A BUREAUCRAT. THE ONLY TIME YOU MEET THEM IS WHEN THEY COME FOR YOUR MONEY. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. START SETTING UP A WIRE TRANSFER. MAYBE-- MAYBE I-- SHUT UP AND DO IT-- ZURICH, SWISS NATIONAL BANK. I'LL PUNCH IN THE ACCOUNT NUMBER MYSELF. I'M TAKING THE MONEY, WILLY, ALL OF IT. OF COURSE YOU ARE. TAKE IT. THAT IS, IF YOU CAN FIND IT. YOU PLAY GAMES WITH ME, WILLY, AND I'LL KILL YOU. TELL HIM. IT'S NOT MY FAULT. TELL HIM WHERE THE MONEY IS. IT'S BASICALLY A VERY, VERY SIMPLE PROCEDURE. I MEAN, WE DO IT DAY IN AND, WELL, DAY OUT. AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY PROBLEM. - WHERE'S THE MONEY? - I DON'T KNOW. DACKHOUSE, PUT THE WEAPON DOWN. DETECTIVE, WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE. SHUT UP, MORTON. GET ON YOUR FEET AND STEP OUT WHERE WE CAN SEE YOU. I SAID PUT THE WEAPON DOWN. DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT AGAIN. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, JACK? ARREST ME? PUT ME IN PRISON? LOCK ME UP WITH HIM AND THE REST OF HUMANITY'S GARBAGE? CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRAY FOR, BUREAUCRAT. YOU JUST MAY GET IT. PUT THE WEAPON ON THE FLOOR AND BACK AWAY. ( gunfire stops ) ( distant sirens wailing ) WHAT THE HELL TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG? SECURE THE WHOLE AREA. THERE'S A COUPLE MORE INSIDE. CUFF HIM. I DIDN'T HURT ANYONE. FEDS. GO FIGURE. ( exhales ) TAKE A BREAK. - THE SURGEON WAS JUST HERE. - AND? HE'S GONNA DO JUST FINE. OH, THEY TELL ME THERE'S QUITE THE FORTUNE IN OUR PARISH BANK ACCOUNT AT THE MOMENT. BUY YOURSELF A NEW BUS. OH, THE MONEY WILL BE RETURNED TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES. THERE'S NO QUESTION OF THAT. OF COURSE, WE'LL HOLD ON TO THE INTEREST. SHE'S A GOOD GIRL, ISN'T SHE? YEAH, SHE IS. THE ONLY THING SHE'S GUILTY OF IS BEING A SURVIVOR. I MISS YOU, SARAH. I MISS YOU A LOT. ( instrumental music playing )
