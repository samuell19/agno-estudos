Sunny, Sunny, Sunny... Brother, I'll be kicked out of the team if I don't play. And lose the job. You're going to be fine. Just fine. Just stay with me. Call Preet. Please call Preet. 'I am Harpreet Kaur.' 'Used to play centre forward for India.' 'But this story isn't about me.' 'It's about Sandeep Singh.' Bikram brother... I've heard that the coach doesn't have a television... so he punishes us for his entertainment. Shut up, Sandeep. We'll get whacked if he hears this. There'll be no stopping me if anyone of you looks at the girls' team again! I'll break your bones. Three minutes. Get 6 Samosas from Changat Ram. Go run. Samosas... Samosas... Changat Ram's? Mangat Ram's? Which one's? Where did you get them from? Man... Mangat Ram... What did he do? Why the punishment? I'd asked him to get Samosas from Changat Ram. Idiot got them from Mangat Ram instead. C'm0n, what difference does it make? It's the same shop with two separate counters. Everything is cooked in the same kitchen. And what a great kitchen it is, I must say. Poor boy is unnecessarily getting his back broken. So? Doesn't look like... He ran away I don't think he's going to come back If he wants to play hockey in Shahbad, this is where he'll have to come. And there's always his elder brother to complete his punishments. Bikram! Why do you want to quit Hockey? Your brother took your share of punishment already Anything but Hockey. There's no way I'm going back to that Kartar. Calm down. Try to get some sleep. Come on. "Oh merciful Lord, let me stay at Your feet." "Oh merciful Lord..." Gurcharan, he's just a kid. He'll take up some other sport. You over think and worry unnecessarily. Can't help it, brother. I am a bit nervous since I lost my house in the flood. If you hadn't given us a place to stay... Enough. Talk about your house again and.. I'll keep the kids and Daljit here... and throw you out. Who are you talking about? Who are you going to throw out? This one. Who else! I have raised and made him a man. And now he's trying to act like my pop. And now he's trying to be my father. Sit. Okay, bro. Don't get angry. Tea's getting cold. "Oh merciful Lord, let me stay at Your feet." "Oh merciful Lord..." My brave child! This entire farmland belongs to us. You can do whatever you like here. Just don't let the birds come near the crop. We'll have lunch together. Do you know how to drive a tractor? - Not yet. - I'll teach you. I'm gonna learn to drive a tractor! Oh no... Yes! Sandeep! Let's go, dude. We're getting late. Your brother must be starving to death. Hurry UP- Slow down, man. I can't hold on to anything. Both my hands are busy feeding you. Gujji, my friend, I'll either die in an accident if I let you ride... or I'll die of hunger if you don't feed me now. Don't you think it would be better if you stop cribbing... and focus on giving me a bit of the pickle instead. Oh really? Stuff it all in then! Hey. Not all of it, dude! How you doing, boys? Coach, 'I must say' Bikram's turned out to be a good player. I have trained him to be a good one. How long do you want these kids to be hanging from up here? No one will get down before four hours or I'll break your backs with your hockey sticks. Heard that? Four hours. Take me along. Let me finish the Samosas first. I'm leaving. No, wait. Hey! That's enough. Coach sir good evening. Good evening sir. Preet pass the ball. Hold this. Presenting... Where's all the pickle, bro? Why didn't you finish off the bread as well? What am I supposed to eat the bread with, my dear? With my love. Hockey players shouldn't be eating too much of pickles. Have fun while you can, sonny. Your time shall come too. For now, it's time for me to leave. Have some. - No, thanks. I'm a very busy person. Where are you off to, Mr. Busy Person? Bye! You got the samosa, right. Now keep hanging up side down. You won't get chance to play hockey anyways. I told you to hold on to the bike, not to lay it down. Thanks to you, racing the bike... the accelerator cable has snapped. Your bike is from the ancient age. What else do you expect? Move aside. I'll fix it. Here comes the doctor of automobiles! What the... Did you get a shot in the rear, doctor? Pass the ball Stop staring with your mouth open Your mouth might just start watering the grass on the ground. How about looking up in the front before flicking the ball? Be glad, it didn't hit you in the front. You're Bikram's brother, right? Right. Not your brother for sure. This area is for players only. Mechanics are not allowed here. I am also a player. Your brother would be ashamed to hear that. I might not be as good as him but I too can play a bit of hockey. Oh really? Let's see how good a player you are then. No, you must be tired. I don't want you to lose and feel embarrassed That's alright. You can think of it as some entertainment for yourself. Let's do it. Come on. One-on-one. Whoever scores, gets the ball. You can try first. If I start the game, you won't get anywhere close to the ball. The game/sport is what really is worth falling for. Don't go wasting time after girls. I've been out of practice for a long time... so I couldn't score. When you have a real goal in life, it'll be easy to score one on the field. Or you'll just keep biting the dust. Madam... Harpreet. Nice to meet you. Sandeep. Ma'am, can we talk in private? Why? Just a little away from Gujji. I don't want him to hear us. I was just trying to act smart in front of my friend. In a game of hockey, I knew you'd beat... Anyhow, forget that now. I was just trying my luck, but I failed. You are not that bad. If you just practice next time, you might just score a goal. Will you play with me next time? Yeah? You can't stop following me. Can you? 'Our lives were about to change in the next six months.' 'Those six months where the best moments of my life...' 'And perhaps of his life as well.' Ouch. Careful there. This isn't a hockey stick. Keep it straight then. There you go. In the age of mobiles and internet... Yellow Printers can't stand to compete in the business. And Sandeep on top of it is of no help. Have your meal and leave the rest in God's hands. Son... Once you get selected for India... I am going to retire from this job... and we'll buy a new place for ourselves. What new place? Brother, I was just saying that... What was I saying? Tell him what I was talking about. He was talking about Bikram getting a place in the Indian team Right. That's what I was talking about. Yes, he will. Of course, he will. Do you doubt that? No. I have no doubts. "Sometimes I address her as my guiding light..." "Sometimes I address her as the love of my life." "Lost in love, I barely survive." "Don't leave me..." "Don't leave..." "I want to dwell in your eyes." "I want to dwell in your eyes." "I want to dwell in your eyes." You ran away nine years ago to escape your punishment. Didn't you? There's no place for a runaway like you on this field. Get lost! Clean that properly! Coach sir, I want to play Hockey. Complete your nine years of punishment first. Till then, don't even think of touching a hockey stick. Is that clear? I said clean that properly! - "This game called love, they say..." "Can't be won or lost, come what may." Keep going straight. Not that way! Go straight, I said! Keep going straight! "Love makes it tough to survive." "You can see how love hurts..." - Show me your hands! Show me your hands! - "The blisters it causes are a curse." "I shall endure all the pain..." "I will never complain." "This game called love, they say..." - Pass it. "Can't be won or lost, come what may." Idiots, can't play. "Costs you your life..." "Love makes it tough to survive." Can I go home, Coach sir? You'll never be able to finish the punishment if you go home. Get going- "Lost in love, I barely survive." "Don't leave me..." "Don't leave..." "Sometimes I address her as my guiding light..." "Sometimes I address her as the love of my life." "Lost in love, I barely survive." - Can I go home, Coach sir? Go. "Don't leave me..." I guess I should stay back and practice a bit more. Get going then. - Okay. Hello! How long will you go on like this? Do you want to play hockey or not? He doesn't let me go anywhere close to hockey. Come play with me, then. Now? When else? It'll get dark in five minutes. Then let's play for five minutes. Sure "When you're away, I've keep visiting saints to set my soul free." "if you ever leave, leave a ring under a berry tree." "When you're away, I've keep visiting saints to set my soul free." That's fantastic! "If you ever leave, leave a ring under a berry tree." "I chant your name, when I miss you." "In the evenings, I kiss the moon too." "I shall endure all the pain..." "I will never complain." - Hurry up. "This game called love, they say..." - "Can't be won or lost, come what may." - There comes my boy! Hop on. "Costs you your life..." "Love makes it tough to survive." Don't worry, I'll talk to your coach. It's your birthday tomorrow. I'm sure he can give you a day off on your birthday. Mum, nobody has forced me to play hockey. I wanted to play hockey for India. There's nothing more I could've asked for. What difference does it make anyway? I don't mind playing hockey on this birthday too like all my other birthdays. Just remain quiet. Let me do the talking. Mum... Is it done? Yes, getting it. - Delicious. - Here you go. - Brother... - Hmm? I was wondering... It's Preeto's birthday tomorrow. If she could get a day off from the practice then I... After Preeto's father passed away, didn't I help Ajit find a job in London? Yes, you did. Yes. I will make sure Preeto plays for India one day. If she wants day offs, you can go look for another coach. No... Hello? I'm outside your house. Meet me for five minutes? Brother, I have a trial for the Indian team next week. Who is it? Ajit'? That's strange. I already told him that you are trying out next week. Why is he asking that again? No! Don't give him the phone. His flight leaves in two minutes. In two minutes, then? No, security check would take ten minutes. But you just said two minutes... Hello, Ajit? What is it? Just wanted to see you for 5 minutes. Why? Don't you see me on the field every day? I don't get to see you with your hair open. Are you done now? You know Gujji, my friend? He says I sing well. So? So... I wanted to sing for you. - Oh really? - Yup. Go ahead. Huh? Go on. I'm listening. - Yeah - Hmm. - Yes. But I haven't rehearsed. Your five minutes are up. Better rehearse and come next time. And don't you dare sing for anyone else. "Sometimes I address her as my guiding light..." "Sometimes I address her as the love of my life." "Lost in love, I barely survive." "Don't leave me..." "Don't leave..." "Sometimes I address her as my guiding light..." "Sometimes I address her as the love of my life." "Lost in love, I barely survive." "Don't leave me..." "Don't leave..." "I want to dwell in your eyes." "I want to dwell in your eyes." Happy Birthday! So that was your brother, is it? Go tell this brother to come here and show me his face... or I'll break your... - Coach sir... It's my fault. So it's you? Bloody coward! So that's the reason why you got back to hockey... for a girl! You've got to slog your guts out to play for India! You won't get an invitation like last night's call... where they'd be obliged to have you go play hockey. Coach sir... You will not reach anywhere in hockey. Get out of here everyone! Enjoying the show, are you? Don't you dare call her again. Get back to hockey you all! You don't need to go with her. If I don't, coach won't let her in. I came to apologize. If you are done... you can leave. Hear me out, please. Shoot. Look here. You are making me lose my cool. You are being quite civil. If I were you, I would have not stopped at words... but what would you do if you were in my place? If I were you, I'd take a lesson from your brother. Bikramjeet is going to play for India. You don't even have a place secured in the University Team. What can I expect from you? I am putting in all my efforts in hockey. I have taken a beating from Kartar sir for 12 long years. I didn't even realize how time ran out. And I never made it to the team. You really think, you'll make it in hockey, starting at this age? What if I do? Come back when you make it and get yourself a job. Harpreet is getting late for her practice. Let's go, Presto. This isn't the last trial. I'll see how you don't get selected. But what happened during the selection? That doesn't matter, mum. I didn't get selected and that's the end of it. Now will anyone tell me about Sandeep? Sunny was going for hockey as an excuse to meet some girl apparently... Hockey wasn't just an excuse. Shall I tell your stories? Why are you dragging me into this? Sandeep... is he alright? Huh? This is his problem. If Sandeep gets in trouble... he'll forget about his own problems and run after him. Stop the car. Sandeep is at the farm. Go meet him. Brother! Look at me. Look up. I heard about your trial. Are you okay? Do you love her? You'll get selected next time. For sure. Should I talk to her family? I already did. When I make it big in hockey, get a job, only then will I show them my face! Job... Dad was so hopeful I'd get selected for India. Then we could get a new house... and he could retire. My time's up, Sunny. Now none of this is going to happen. It was all going fine till yesterday. Now it feels like nothing will get better. You have more of these balls? Yes, Why? Where are they? Over there. What happened? Stay there. Hit the ball. But the birds have already flown away. Forget the birds. Just hit the ball. Go on. No, no, no! Hit it just like you did before. Come back. Go. Come back. Here... Now hit both of them. What's going on, bro? Hit them. What the... What did you promise them? When you earn a name for yourself in hockey and get a job... only then will you show them your face, right? Yeah, so? You better wash your face, then. You're gonna have to show your face very soon. How? With your drag-flick! Drag-flick? Give me that. Get a ball. Place it here. When you run in like this... dragging the ball with the stick... and then, hit the ball, which is called a flick... it becomes a drag-flick! This is a drag-flick? Since the time uncle asked me to keep the birds away from the crops... this is how I have been scaring them away. This is the most difficult shot in Hockey. Even a good player takes years to get it right. And if you can hit it right on this surface, then... Then? Then probably, one of our father's sons could still play for India. But how will India come to know about me? From Patiala. Shall we? Take your stick, mister. Are you sure, that's a drag-flick? Yes, it is. That's the building. Go left, go left. Go left! Sukhi, lose the cover... go for it. Sir, someone's here to meet you. Can't you see the practice is on? Sorry for disturbing you, sir. Sir! Welcome, sir. What would I do without the Hockey Federation! I would've been a mere physical trainer at some high school in Patna. You underestimate yourself, coach. All thanks to you guys. Excuse me? Nothing. Tell me, how can I help you? Harry sir. You need to give a lecture on sports and its impact on young minds... at Chandigarh University, tomorrow evening. Who ditched you at the last moment that you had to come begging to me? I told the Chairman that you'd know. Cover him! So you are going? Sir, you know it's family time for me in the evenings. Family time! You know it's a very important time. Chairman's order, sir. Let him know... I'll be there. Sure, coach. All good, coach sir? What brings you here? This is my younger brother, Sandeep. Does he also need a lecture? No. You should have a look at his drag-flick. He's very good at it. Which state? University, sir. Why are you wasting my time? Very bad time, sir. I deserve a chance, sir. You expect me try out university players of this country? And give lectures at various colleges? Who will prepare the team for Olympics? You? If I am really worth it, you'll get a good player in your team. And if I am not... you can vent out all the frustration caused by the Federation at me. Bad luck. Manpreet! Come to the goalpost! Yes sir. Let's get done with this. Follow me. What is it? Why have you stopped? Do you want me to get you the Indian team's goalkeeper for you? Why not, sir? If I am trying for the Indian team, I'd rather be tested by the team's goalkeeper. Sunny! You know how they say it in my village. Make them run and make them bleed. Don't you worry! Only curses for you, no blood. You, however... will not be forgiven for wasting my time, in spite of being a senior player. I shall make you run and make you bleed. Kamaldeep! Come here, my boy. Good. You can go and rest. You seem to be too small for him. Whoever utters shall be happy, shall be fulfilled Focus. Keep on focusing. All good now or do you also need Dhanraj Pillai to wish you luck. Very good idea. I'll give him a call. Give it to me. Eternal is the holy... time less god. Go sunny. Partner, if he can hit such a fast drag-flick on the grass... He'll tear up the net on the Turf. Hitting it hard isn't enough. If you hit a goal using the right technique... then no one can throw you out of the team. Sir, I'll do the hard work if you teach me the technique. So what, even if you learn that technique? Even if you hit 2O drag-flicks in a 7O minutes long match... you'd still have played only for 5 minutes. What do I do with you for the rest of the time? Mollycoddle you? You'll have to become a defender. Make me one. Thank you. Family time for sir now. Dismiss. Be on the ground at five. Be a minute late and I'll make you run and bleed. Sunny! _ Bro! Yes! Go, live my dream! "Face your fate without a fright." "Live less," Good morning, sir. - "but live with pride." All the best. "Fight... for tomorrow belongs to you." You need strength in your legs to play hockey. "Be strong... you gotta survive too." - Go, go, go. GO, go! The basic rule of being a defender... ball in your 'D' is like a bomb. What is it? - Bomb! - Yes! You have to get it out of there as soon as possible. And once outside the 'D', it's like your girlfriend. Don't let the opposing team near it. Right, partner? - Yep India's jersey. Mother... How does it look? "The heart soared but didn't score." "Score a goal and let the heart soar." Open up, open UP- Never commit on the ball till the very last second. It's as good as committing suicide. - Right. Come on, come on. Come on, come OH, COMB OH. "Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!" "Our hockey king!" "Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!" "Our hockey king!" If you keep tackling like this... the opponent's knickers will be in a twist. Say what? Knickers will be in a twist. - Yes. Go, one more. "Our hockey king!" Action on reaction. Use your brain. Don't think like a buffalo, think like a criminal. "What's happening around you shouldn't bother you." Go, go, come on. Five seconds. Very good. Go back. Don't think about that, concentrate on defense. Come back. Come back, Sandeep. Forget that. Concentrate on defense. Come back. Striker ready? "You have to flow like a ragging river too." "You need to reach your goal." "You cannot afford to lag behind in the race anymore." Hold it tight. "Flicker Singh!" "Forget everything else." "Your thought was great I must say." "I met you midway..." Three, two, one... "Don't stop at the shore." "Keep swimming, stay afloat..." "The currents will lead you I am sure." Booked your train tickets already? B99 your pardon'? Don't worry if you haven't. Federation can always send you in the luggage compartment. I know the Federation's rule. We are not allowed to play at night. So, then? How will I get selected in the Indian team without hitting any goals? I am only defending goals during day. So I thought I'd practice hitting some at night. I'd rather take a risk and get selected in the team... than not take any risks and go back home in the luggage compartment. Running around like this won't help you. What do you mean? Federation won't hold you accountable for any of these balls. And you are? I am the Federation. It's an honour, Mr. Chairman. Carry on. Thank you, sir. The match starts. The Meerut versus Patiala match has begun. Partner... - Hmm. I see guns in the hands of the audience. After dodging Harmeet he has passed the ball to the centre forward. And... That's Meerut's first goal! Nailed it! Harmeet from the Patiala team is injured. Coach sir, allow me. Go. Injured Harmeet has been replaced by number four jersey, Sandeep Singh. Prakash welcomes Sandeep by hitting with the ball. Sandeep Singh appeals. Sandeep. Meerut trying to pressurize Patiala. But don't you underestimate Patiala, Mr. Nadeem. Sandeep leave it. Sandeep is at the risk of getting a yellow card. The referee seems like a landline phone in the times of mobiles. You better put that gun back into your knickers. I come from Bihar. I can spit and make a hole in your forehead. His spit, not mine. Thank you, thank you. Patiala zero, Meerut one. A good pass by Sandeep to the center forward. Number 19 is dragging the ball towards the 'D'. And... And a foul for hitting inside the 'D'. Short Corner for Patiala, Mr. Nadeem. First chance for Patiala to score a goal. Sir? I'm looking out for probable players for the Junior Indian team. And Sandeep Singh will take the short-corner. Isn't he the one who practices at night? Yes, sir. Sandeep Singh ready to play the Short Corner. Vijay makes a pass. Golden opportunity for Patiala. Sandeep Singh flicks and... Scores a goal! And the score's one all, Mr. Nadeem. That fast a drag-flick on the grass! He'd... He'd tear through the net on the turf, sir. Sorry, sir. Another goal for Patiala from the Penalty Corner. Patiala three, Meerut one. Sandeep Singh has been scoring goals non-stop. Plays great defense as well. Mr. Nadeem, another goal for Patiala. So... should I recommend him? He's a temperamental player. He could get disqualified in the next 15 minutes. Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! However, he can be a huge asset even if he plays for only 15 minutes. Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Then prepare him to last for 7O minutes. - Only five minutes left for the game to end. - Yes, sir. Patiala leading with six goals. Mr. Nadeem... Spectators are getting more enthusiatic for Patiala. Another chance to score for Sandeep Singh. Will he score his eighth goal here? Audience is excited. And what do we have here? Indian women's team's Harpreet Kaur seems to have arrived here. She played a great game against Germany yesterday. Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Young lad got distracted and missed the goal. A great save by Meerut. You should sit back and relax now. The match is over. Meerut has lost the game... in spite of saving this goal. Well played, Sandeep Singh. You distracted me. You could've seen me score if you would've come earlier. Well, then you would've probably missed all the goals. That's right. You better not watch me play ever. What are you looking at? The Indian jersey looks good on you. Looking at your progress in just 6 months... you better be prepared to fetch one for yourself anytime soon. Once I get selected for lndia... we'll have the biggest wedding in town. Followed by a honeymoon in Switzerland? Exactly. Three kids? Yeah... Looking just like you. Or one could be like me. And which car shall we buy? A sports car! The one with a sunroof. A new house? Yes. And we should have that... what's it called... the round bubbling water tub... JacuzzL Yeah, Jacuzzi. You'll find plenty in our town who are dying to go to Switzerland... and hordes of more such people across the country. There are only 11 such fools... who would not get distracted by some girl while striking a goal... because they aren't scoring in order to get a pool or a car. They are scoring goals for India. You seem to be quite a serious kind of girl. I'll score goals for India as well. If I play for India, you'll be mine, right? Did you rehearse the song for me? Yes. Not really. Couldn't spare time from Hockey. "Sometimes I address her as my guiding light..." "Sometimes I address her as the love of my life." "Sometimes I address her as my guiding light..." "Sometimes I address her as the love of my life." "Lost in love, I barely survive." "Don't leave me..." 'Sandeep scored 6O goals in three months.' 'And won eight man of the tournament trophies.' 'For how long could India Hockey ignore such a special player?' Hello? Mum, is Bikram there? Sunny? How are you? It's been so long. - I don't have much time, mum. ls Bikram there? Bikram's gone to Mr. Sharma's with your dad. Are you there? Hello? Hello? Silly boy! Hung up on me. You're allowed only one call at a time. You are talking to your senior. Have some respect. Hello? It's me, Sandeep. Is Bikram there? No, he's not here. Okay, uncle. Is someone knocking at your door? Let me check. - Hello. - Hello. It's for you. - It's Sandeep. - Sandeep? Yes. Hello? Sandeep, you rascal! Where have you been? I have been distributing my own wedding invites here. Bro, I got selected for India. I wanted you to be the first one to know. I'm going on a tour to Poland. If I make it to the finals, I won't be able attend the wedding. That's not a problem. Don't just reach the finals. You must win the finals! You got that? Many players get selected to play for India but only a few last long enough. Don't worry about anything else. We shall celebrate once you are back. Okay? Take care of yourself. Bye. Sandeep has been selected in the Indian Team. Congratulations! Calls for a double celebration. Well done! What's with your attitude, man? I'm a much senior player than you. I'm a kabbadi player, bro. Sorry. I got selected for India. It's looking good on you... the Indian jersey. If you play well, you'll never lose it. Go, nail them. All the best. Thank you sir. Yes! And an amazing goal in the first 15 minutes of the match! Germany messes it up once again! Temperament plays an important role in a player's career. Sandeep Singh will have to keep that in mind. Yes! Body tackle by Euan and Zgnacio.. Is an easy way to get a player out through yellow card. Come on. An amazing goal by Sandeep Singh. Foul! As long as he's on the field, he'll keep scoring goals. And before you know it, he'll pick on a fight. Are you going to play like this. - Yes! - And with this goal... Sandeep Singh becomes the second highest goal scorer of the tournament. Welcome to the 6 Nations Series Finals. India versus Pakistan. The match is not only between these 2 countries... but it's also a contest between Pakistan's TanveerAlam, the highest goal scorer so far... and India's Sandeep Singh, the 2nd highest goal scorer. Bikram, I feel that may be if Coach Harry would've... managed to keep Sandeep Singh on the field for all of the 70 minutes... in the last few matches, he could've been leading already. May be... and he could've also been out of the tournament by now for all you know... if he would've got another yellow card. Go.. Go..Go Move... Move... And a sloppy pass by Harmeet. Oh no, Sandeep Singh just manages to dodge that. It seems like Pakistan too is following the same strategy as other teams. Attacking Sandeep Singh. - Come on. - Sandeep... You have to stick around throughout... all of 70 minutes! Keep your cool. Go for it, it's moving away. Go, go, go... Sandeep moving forward with the ball, dodges Tanveer. Moving forward he also manages to dodge Ahmad Mushtaq. Oh my God! Sneaking in from behind and a blow on the nose. Has he fainted? That must have hit him hard. Sandeep, you alright? Tanveer will have to pay the price for this. Sandeep... good job. It's a pity that both the highest and the second highest goal scorer... are out of the game. Losing a defender at this stage could mean a huge loss to the team. Pakistan will surely cash in on this opportunity. He has lost a lot of blood. I doubt if Sandeep will be able to make a comeback after this. Pass, pass, pass... Pass it to Tariq. Good, good, good. Go for it. Yusuf with the ball on centre forward. Dodges the defender, moves forward. And a powerful strike. Goes straight to the goal! Yes! - Fantastic goal! Yeah! Go. And with that, we are at half time. He's playing well. Just as I predicted, Pakistan is taking advantage of India's weak defense. Well done, boys. India needs Sandeep Singh at this point. You are not going back. Coach sir... I've been seeing hockey for around 20 years now. They'll break you if you go back there. Your first tournament will be the end of your career. My career doesn't matter. I'm not a legend. This is my first tournament. I am replaceable. And with that whistle, the second half begins. Go, go, go. Good job. Ready? Lobou. - Yes, take it. Hey Bikram... Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Rajinder! - Sandeep Singh is back. Very good. Come on, Sandeep. We are already 2O minutes into the second half. Pass ahead. Hit it, hit it back. Come on Come on. The centre forward moves with the ball. He manages to get to the 'D', Nitin cuts in and... lndia gets a short-corner. India gets its first short-corner. It seems like Sandeep Singh's entry has changed the game. Yousof, cross the angle, cross the angle. That's an amazing backward pass to Harmeet. And Harmeet slap shots it straight into the goal. Wow, what a goal! We're in trouble. Sandeep Singh is back! Like a true warrior! Ninety seconds to go. Pass the ball... Pass the ball... GO, go! What was that? A 360 degree dodge by Sandeep! It's a foul. Fantastic partnership between Sandeep and Nitin. And there... India gets its second short-corner! He will again beat them. Partner, if Sandeep scores another goal, he'll become the highest goal scorer. He will, for sure. And he could also become the player of the tournament. Sandeep we have to win the match. Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! Sandeep! And that's a fantastic goal! A historic win for India in the 6 Nations Series Finals. Look at the speedometer. Sandeep Singh has broken his own record. His last drag-flick was recorded to be 108 kms/hr. And this goal was drag-flicked at the speed of 120 kms/hr. After this supersonic drag-flick... this new boy should be renamed as... Flicker Singh instead of Sandeep Singh. Yes, Flicker Singh! "Our hockey king!" "Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh! Our hockey king!" Sandeep Singh! This is my son, Zorawar. He wants to be a hockey player like you. - Great. - Can we get an autograph, please? Of course. Here you go, son. Thank you. God bless you. Are you doing good? What happened to your nose? Nothing much. Listen... They haven't printed much about you in Punjabi newspapers. Whatever little they have, it's about some Flicker Singh. You told us that you scored most of the goals. Yes, that's me. I am Flicker Singh. - What? - Look at this. The Media has given me a new name. Flicker Singh scores maximum... - Sir... Sir, you became the highest goal scorer in your first international series. How does that feel? I feel good. He feels good... very good. I am also feeling very good. I am his father. And he is my son. Look at this. His photo got printed in the newspaper. He looks so handsome, doesn't he? We live in a town called Shahbad. And... the camera... sorry, just a little to the... that's good. So we live in Shahbad and he has been playing hockey since his childhood. And look at him... He's made us so proud today. When will this appear on TV? On which channel will it be aired? Thank you. Thank you, Media. Are you happy now? Very haPPV- I am happier than Mogambo has ever been. Okay, hold this. I have some news for you too. Take this. Indian Airways? Go on. Read it. Dear Sandeep Singh... This is to inform you that you are now a part of Indian Airways. The letter arrived at home soon after your selection. You've got the job! Thank you, Director, Indian Airways. And here's my resignation. Shahbad is here! Shahbad! Shahbad! Shahbad! I've said my final goodbyes to Yellow Printers. Shahbad! Shahbad! Shahbad! Shahbad! Shahbad! Shahbad! We've reached. Shahbad's here! Get down. Stop the bus for us. Hop on. Come on. You go ahead. I'll be back in a bit. Come home first. I'll be right back. Go. Flicker Singh! Do you remember the address to your new house? Yes! Bani never scores a goal. She's a goalkeeper, mom. - Hello, aunty. Hello, son. No matter where they make you stand, you always score a goal. C'm0n, mom. Preet. Hello. Ajit had asked me to see you only when I earn a name for myself in hockey. What is this? What should I do with this? It's not for you. Idiot, you got the job because you are a part of the team now. In no time you'll be out of the team and this is where you'll have to come back... to be bashed up with my hockey stick. He scored 16 goals, coach sir. The Indian team doesn't have a better drag-flicker than him. Chances of him being dropped are slim, sir. Zip it up. Just zip it up. You got a chance to play for India because of my training. Don't you forget that! I played for India... without your training. So I'm sure others can manage too. You too shouldn't forget that. Do you want her to play for India or get married and stay at home? No! Preet will play for India even after we get married. If we get your support. Give me my hockey stick! Don't bother. Last time I didn't say a word to save Preet from your beating and I was your student then. This time you won't be the only one using the hockey stick. And after we are done, forget getting Samosas (Indian snack) for you.. No one will bother to even get you any water. Bloody... Get back... I want everyone back on the ground. Welcome, my brave lad. The new star player of the Indian hockey team will be greeted... to our new house by the new member of our family, our daughter-in-law! Let's give him a round of applause! - "Mr. Sandeep Singh!" "The new shinning star of Indian Hockey..." "The talk of the town... is back." "Welcome home." "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Young lad is back from the hunt..." "He's a fearless huntsman." "He scares away the doe." "He rides a lion." "He's a fearless huntsman." "Let's have a bet, there's no backing out." "Royal style, royal life." "He flirts with beauties." "Everything about him is unique." "Let's have a bet, there's no backing out." "He flirts with beauties." "Everything about him is unique." "It's a pleasure to know him." "He is my life, my buddy." "Can give up the world for him, my brother." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Samaritan, a good man." "Samaritan, a good man." "Make some noise..." "Get yourself heard." "It's time you inform the world." "And beloved, replied the world to it..." "Here comes a force to reckon with." "Let's have a bet, there's no backing out." "Royal style, royal life." "He flirts with beauties." "Everything about him is unique." "It's a pleasure to know him." "He is my life, my love." "Can give up the world for him." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Samaritan, a good man." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Samaritan, a good man." "Samaritan, a good man." "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" I have a trial in the morning. I must leave. What? Well... Nothing. Say it. I won't be able to stop if I start. Say it. No one will stop you. I can hear you. Really? You've got a lifetime to tell me whatever you want to. Go, play for the World Cup first. I'll do my best. Promise me, you won't see my matches. I won't. I didn't see the Poland tournament... and you went on to become the highest goal scorer. You must win this one. Once I am back from the World Cup... we'll all go for a vacation to Shimla. Do you remember the last time we went for a vacation? Did we ever go for one? You were 3 years old when dad took us all to Delhi. We had a shoestring budget so we were all put up in the same room... Sunny! You are late. All five of us in the same room? Right. You were fine, sleeping on the bed with mum and dad. I had to sleep on the floor with grandma. We'll book three hotel rooms when we go to Shimla. Take this. Watch it! Be careful, man! - Sorry, sorry. It's okay. No worries. Hail Almighty. - Hail Almighty. GO, go! What shall I get you? Gold. Just win the gold! Sandeep you must have a lot of girlfriends. Whose number is it. Give it to me. Sunny! Let's go, Sunny. Cheeku has got a seat for you there. Let it be. I'm quite comfortable over here. Don't irritate me now. Let's go and sit there. - Come on. - Okay, bye. Let's go. Come on. Here. - Keep this. I wore it as a child. - Fine. This one, it's from our uncle. Don't even bother opening. - How much do you think it is? He's a miser. Let me check. Your family is full of misers. And your family is so generous, right? Your family is so stingy. Forget it. I know. Sunny? - Yes. I always take this seat whenever I'm on a tour. Okay- It's lucky for me. You even had a girlfriend named Lucky. She left you, didn't she? And guess what, he bought the train tickets for her. Sunny, come and sit here. Let me settle the score with him today. Sure. - Just remain seated where you are. Don't drag this. Remain seated. I don't care. Come and sit here. Come on. There you go. - Your relatives didn't give us anything. All of this was gifted by my family. - Don't get me started. And what lovely gifts they gave... some old empty bottles of supplements! What the hell? You call this a gift? What can I say? - I thought she was loaded. Did her father come along, let me check... - Excuse me... Hello. Yes? Did you board the train from Shahbad? Yes. Why? So you got married in Shahbad. Good. What's your problem, man? Brother, my name is Sandeep Singh. Team India's hockey player. How does that concern us? I too am from Shahbad. Oh, is that you? What do they call you these days in the newspapers? Flicker Singh. Yes, Flicker Singh. I saw your picture in the newspaper. You looked cute. Thank you. Neetu, come on this side. Come on, get up. Drop it. - Fine. Bro...? Actually, I am planning to get married soon. That's why I asked. - Okay. Don't worry. Why don't you give me an autograph. - Okay. What are you doing, Neetu? Just a minute. Where's the pen? Here it is. Here you go. What did you say your name is? Neetu. Neetu? - Yes. Dear Neetu... Yes. Bro, don't forget to mention Balveer as well. Of course, considering you two are married now... Balveer will always be there along with Neetu. Okay. 'Dear... Dear Neetu... and Balveer.' - When are you getting married? If I could, I would get married today. In the train? Soon. Okay- 'Happy married life' 'Sandeep Singh' Bro... Sunny! - Sunny! What's wrong? _ S Sunny! Unny! What happened? Sunny! Sunny! Sunny! Sunny! - Sunny! What's happened to you? Sunny? - Brother? Brother, I didn't shoot you on purpose. You didn't do it on purpose? - I didn't know! You didn't do it on purpose? Cheeku! Cheeku! Sunny! - Brother? Sunny! Get up! Sunny! Sunny! Cheeku! Go and stop the train. I'll page them. You be with him. I didn't realize, there's a bullet in the chamber. Sunny... - Brother? Sunny, it's going to be okay. Hold on, Sunny. Sunny, I won't let anything happen to you. Hold on, Sunny. Cheeku, stop the train! You will be fine. Don't worry. Keep your eyes open, Sunny. Keep your eyes open. Sunny? Open your eyes, Sunny. Keep them open. Brother, if I don't go play, I'll be out of the team. And the job... Sunny Call Preet. Please call Preet. You'll be fine. I promise. The doctors seem good. Why isn't anyone telling us anything? Who knows if Sunny will ever come out of coma? Why won't he? Of course he will. Mother... My child... He'll be fine. According to the current market rates.. You won't get more than this for your house. We just bought it a month ago? How can the rates change so drastically in just a month? It's okay, son. Let it go. Take this. Climb up. Mr. Gurcharan, are you sure you want to get back to your field job? Mr. Joshi, when I had to walk endlessly... carrying this 3O kgs heavy bag, I never felt as tired... as I feel now just sitting in the hospital. I don't want to lose this habit of walking. Don't worry. I'll manage. How is Sandeep? I'm fine. I asked, how is Sandeep? Sandeep... still the same. There is no change in his condition. I wonder why God did this to him. Are you leaving the tour midway? Not only will the Federation raise a question... but I too will make sure, this is the end of your career if you leave now. I will face the Federation. And as far as my career is concerned... if I'm capable enough to play for India, no one can stop me from playing. Not even you. 'Dear Sandeep, I... An arrow piercing the heart... You.' What does that mean? It means I love you. Thank you, son. 'Get well soon.' 'Preeti' Since when did you become so popular amongst the girls? Sandeep has a lot of fans now. 'I have started playing hockey because of you.' 'I wish to become a drag-flicker like you one day.' Even kids are writing to you. Look at this. He's drawn a picture for you. A hockey stick and a ball. Dad, the day will come to an end by the time you finish reading all these letters. Take a break and let him have his food first. Come on. Going over to our sports correspondent, Suyash... who's right outside PGI Chandigarh.. Suyash, is it true that Sandeep Singh is out of coma? Yes Shalini, that is true. After 15 days, Sandeep is finally out of coma. His condition is improving. This is good news, Suyash. Why isn't it getting switched off? Hockey fans can breathe a sigh of relief after hearing this news. This means we'll soon see Sandeep Singh back on the hockey field. Right? Shalini, though Sandeep has come out of a coma... but the news is not good for the hockey fans. After talking to the doctors we have learnt that.. Sandeep has been left paralysed below the waist. Oh, seriously? The hockey fans here are terribly disheartened to know... that Sandeep Singh, the star drag-flicker of the Indian team... will never be able to step on a hockey field ever again. Shalini, this brings us to an important question coming to everyone's mind. If Sandeep would have been given the required medical treatment on time... could we have saved him from getting paralysed. This raises a question on the Indian medical system. If an Indian hockey player doesn't get an ambulance... for 6 hours after being shot, what can a common man expect? We will keep getting live updates for you. But until then with great regret we have to say that.. Sandeep Singh, the star player of Indian Hockey Team.. Won't be able to stand up on his feet ever again. That was our correspondent... - These media... - Suyash from PGI Chandigarh. - Guys speak any rubbish they want. We will see you after a short break. Keep watching your favorite channel, Y News. I was going to... Leave. I was about to tell you. All of you, please leave. Brother! Brother! Bikram! Bikram! Sunny! What happened, Sunny? What's wrong? I've been calling out to you! I'd gone to get the medicines. Why didn't you call the nurse? You know that I feel shy. I don't even let dad in. And you still left me alone. It's my fault. I'll never leave you alone. Okay? Come on now, lie on your side. A little more. Move this hand. Be careful. Good job. A little more. You are my brave brother. What is it? Nothing much has happened. That's it. Careful there. We can't make it to Switzerland now. Never mind. We can go to Shimla (small town in northern India) instead. With you by my side, Shimla will be as good as Switzerland. Doctors think there is a possibility that you could get back on your feet. A very slim chance. And hockey is out of the question. It's okay. I played hockey only for you. Now if I'm destined to be bound to a wheelchair then so be it. As long as you are with me. What are you saying? You're a sportsman. How can you be happy in a wheelchair? 'I thought I was going to meet an Indian hockey player..' '...who must be perhaps shattered to know...' '...that he's never going to be able to play hockey again...' '...but I met just another boy who forgot everything about that.' 'He was just happy to see me, his Preet by his side' Let's go. You're sure you want to go? Yes, mom. I am sure. I don't mind pushing a wheelchair for the rest of my life. I will do it happily if Sandeep is on that wheelchair. But I'd be happier to see him standing on his own two feet. Even if he does so without me. Are you sure, he'll get back on his feet if you are not here with him? No, I'm not... but I'm sure, he'll never get back on his feet if I am with him. You know, all that he did so far was all for me. Be it hockey, getting a job or getting beaten up by the coach. Now if he gets me... he won't even bother to try and get back on his feet. 'Last and final call for Harpreet Kaur... Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Bro, I've been asking you since so many days now. Where is Preet? She just came to meet me once and then disappeared. You didn't find out? How do I find out? I spend the nights here with you and go to work during the day. I hope she is fine. We're going back home anyway. I'll find out once you settle at home. Okay, mister? Okay? Come on, my boy. Let's go. Come on. Good. My brave lad is back. Thank you. Welcome home. Let's go. Thank you, God. Let's go, mum. You can do the crying part inside. Come, son. - I'm kidding. Come, son. Come inside. Let's go, son. Let's go inside. Here we go, bro. Come on, everyone. Come. - Wait. Let me set the mood right. "Mr. Sandeep Singh!" "The new shinning star of Indian Hockey..." "The talk of the town... is back." "Welcome home." "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" "Welcome!" Gurcharan, come on, dance along. Come on. You can do better. - "Young lad is back from the hunt..." - There you go, brother. Join us, son. "He rides a lion." "He's a fearless huntsman." Go ahead, uncle. - Oh, c'mon. "Let's have a bet, there's no backing out." "He flirts with beauties." "It's a pleasure to know him." "He is my life, my buddy." "Can give up the world for him, my brother." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Good man..." "Good man, the Samaritan." "Samaritan, a good man." Answer the phone, Preet. You didn't want to come to the hospital. I can understand. Are you going to leave me alone in this state, huh? Is this my fault? What have I done wrong? I want to hear your voice. Please. I'll keep calling, Preet. I will, till you don't answer the phone. Till you don't talk to me. Till you don't laugh when I sing. I'll keep calling till you don't come back. Preet... Do you want me to beg of you? Is that what you want? Get this straight. When God stops answering the prayers... people stop believing in him I feel so embarrassed now. When I was at my worst, I told you things.. Which I was scared to tell to my own self. I feel disgusted. Don't... don't you dare come in front of me ever again. Sunny! Come on... Hold onto me, come on. What were you doing? What do you want? How many times did I ask you to go find out where Preet is! You are just busy doing your own stuff. What? My own stuff? Cleaning your shit is "my own stuff"? Shush. If you just had to rub it in, why did you do it in the first place? If that's what I intended to do, I could've listed many more things. And everyone here could have done so. Do you want me to bow down and thank all of you for it? No one needs your acknowledgement. I am working at 2 places to run the house. Dad has resumed his field job! - No... Bikram. Wait... he barely escaped being run over by a train! Did you even realize that we have come back to our old house? Yes, mom sold the new house... to pay off the expenses for your treatment. Look around you, mister! Son... He wants to thank us for all of that. Don't do it if it is such a trouble! Leave me! Come on. - No... Let me take you there. - No... Bikram I'll take you to her house. - No. She came to the hospital, saw you in that state and went away! Her house is locked! Stop it! Son... Mom... I'll see to it that he doesn't go unpunished. He shot at my son. My brave lad... Don't you worry. I'll make sure he rots in the prison all his life. I'll do anything I have to but I won't spare him. If you really want to do something for me, help me get back on my feet. Take your resignation letter. Haven't put a date yet. I want to take up one of the jobs Bikram is doing. I want to put a date on your resignation letter. I want to get back on my feet. I have already spoken to the Chairman and Harry sir. My child has grown up into a man. Well done, my boy. Well done. There, our famous captain, Mr. Dhyan Chand. Today is your last day. Sharma will be replacing you tomorrow. Rehabilitation in Holland will cost us around 3.5 million. Mr. Chairman, we are talking about Hockey here and not Cricket. A player is a player, sir. Be it a cricket player or a hockey player. We'll have to take a chance. Hmm. You will take your chance and retire. It is me who will be questioned. Sir, we are giving him a pension. And there are millions working, sitting on a wheelchair. These millions don't play for India, Sharma. Sir... Kids play cricket in every street of this country.. With a dream that if they play for India then their life will be made. I agree that we aren't the Cricket Board. But if we want our Hockey to reach the same point where it was.. Then we will have to look after our players. We will have to respect them. Okay- Both of you wait outside for some time. Okay, sir. - Okay, sir. Presto. Why are you taking it so personally, Mr. Chairman? You should just retire and leave all of this to me. Why spend so much on a handicapped player? That too out of my budget? Once I am done with you, no budget will be able to fix you. Sir... Thank you, sir. It isn't a favor. It is my duty. All the best. The hospital... It's okay, brother. I am feeling scared, Coach sir. Everyone is trying their best and... And if I don't get back on my feet... Are you fishing for a compliment? I have seen many players. You are a good one. This is my India Jersey. I want it back soon. We'll miss you. 'He got the sanction for rehab in just one day.' 'But the year that followed, was quite difficult for both of us.' 'Both of us were in a foreign land' 'We were amongst people...' '...and yet lonely' "To live without you, is deceitful." "To live without you, is difficult." "Memories haunt me." "Heartache taunts me." "How do I convince my life?" "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "What I tried to snatch away from life could never be with me." "From a distance, there is no regret, I believe." "Leave me alone, with my solitude." "Don't let my anger cause any harm come to you." "To live without you, is deceitful." "Without you..." "To live without you, is deceitful." "Without you..." "Without you, how do I convince my life?" "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Lord, give me the strength." "I am no devotee, give me devotion." "Waheguru, Allah, You have many names." "Waheguru, Allah, You have many names." "The wealth your love, let me claim." "To live without you, is deceitful." "To live without you, is difficult." "Memories haunt me." "Heartache taunts me." "How do I convince my life?" "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." "Oh stranger..." Brother, the flight from Holland will land at eight. This idiot has brought us here at six! Let it be Gurcharan. He is eager to meet Sunny. Am I right, Bikram? If he is that eager then he should have come at four instead. Where are those musicians? I told you not to pay them in advance. No one listens to me. You have called them, right? Of course, I did. I had called them. Then why didn't they show up? "Make sure the flag hoists high." "My body is my country, I cry." "This is what keeps me alive." "Don't stop at the shore." "Keep swimming, stay afloat..." "The currents will lead you I am sure." My child... Oh God! My child... Thank you, God. Oh God! Cleaning your shit is "my own stuff"? 'If you just had to rub it in, why did you do it in the first place?' 'If that's what I intended to do, I could've listed many more things.' 'Do you want me to bow down and thank all of you for it?' Sandeep! Sit down. Sit! I am your elder brother. I know why you are here. You need my help, right? Hold my feet and apologize. Go on and apologize. I want to play for India, brother. Please help me. Do you really want to play for India or is it for that girl? I am not that selfish. I accept, the first time ever I tried to stand on my own two feet was for her... but I went to rehab for our family. And now I want to play for India, for our country. Move. There is an Indian Airways tournament. But there is a problem. What? It is against my team. Are you scared to play against me? Idiot! It took you 6 months to come to me and apologize. I'll see you while I train you. And I'll take my revenge on the field. Okay? Okay- Smile. Let's go then? For a run? Hmm? Lucky scoundrel managed to get back on his feet. "Behind me lurks darkness..." "Ahead lies a storm." "In this storm I want a lamp to survive." Let's go. Good morning. "Either the heart will turn into stone." "Or the heart of stone will beat." "I have taken up a challenge to feel alive." "Forget..." Sunny... Sunny, body play. Use distraction to get the ball. Go get it. "Forget, the night long gone..." "Start afresh this morning." Yeah. Up. Left... Left, left, left. Back, back. "Look up, soar high, from ground to sky, oh my brother." "Oh my brother..." "They stick to their guns, these brave warriors." "Handsome and charming, our brave warriors." "They stick to their guns, these brave warriors." "Handsome and charming, our brave warriors." "Faced death..." "Battled storms..." "Survived, I have." "To the beckon of life." "To make a better life." "Survived, I have." "Defamed I was, to build a new name." "I had started something, to take it to end." "Embrace me, life..." "Look up, soar high, from ground to sky, oh my brother." GO, go! "Look up, soar high, from ground to sky, oh my brother." "Oh my brother..." "They stick to their guns, these brave warriors." Yes, yes, yes! "Handsome and charming, our brave warriors." "They stick to their guns, these brave warriors." "Handsome and charming, our brave warriors." Good job. Pass the ball! Pass the ball! Push it. Call the goalie. Yoginder! Come here! Good job. Straight, straight, straight! Partner... Sandeep. Sir... I have your jersey safe with me. Just waiting to put it on. Short-corner! Ready for a drag-flick? Partner... as powerful as before! One year of your chairmanship and I get called back! What's going on? Sir, you asked me to make a file of the mistakes made by our team, so... The biggest mistake was that goals weren't scored. Sir, Sandeep is back. We could consider him for the Commonwealth Championship. He will surely be considered... but you won't be. Harry... Yes, sir. You will form the team. Thank you, sir. Victory to India! "Forget, the night long gone..." "Start afresh this morning." "Look up, soar high, from ground to sky, oh my brother." "Look up, soar high, from ground to sky, oh my brother." "Oh my brother..." "They stick to their guns, these brave warriors." "Handsome and charming, our brave warriors." "They stick to their guns, these brave warriors." "Handsome and charming, our brave warriors." Federation has sent tickets for the England match. Did you hear uncle's plan? He's putting up a big screen on the hockey field. He has invited the entire neighbourhood. There will be drums, a DJ and the works. Can I get three tickets? No. All of them are yours. You can keep them. Whom do you wish to give them to? I didn't want to invite them without informing you. We've been through a lot to get here. Just be careful. You have a match next week. 'I was so happy to hear that Sandeep was not only fine...' 'but was also back on his feet, running and playing hockey as well.' 'International hockey doesn't give a second chance to any player' 'Sandeep had grabbed this chance' 'And everyone was going to witness the outcome in the next match' 'The match that was going to take place in my new city, London' You look just the same. How? The way you did when we last met. I'm glad you don't look the same. There's something I wanted to ask you. How's hockey going for you? I thought you'd ask something else. I started playing hockey for you. I had no other goal in life then... other than you. Then you went away. To be honest, I cursed you then... but I would not have got back on my feet if you had not left. I called you here to thank you. You're coming for tomorrow's match? I might... I guess, this is what I was hoping to hear. I'll wait for you. Tanveer won't witness his defeat, sitting on the bench this time. He will see it on the field. Tanveer, you have to break Sandeep. Even if we let them score 12 goals... the 13th will be ours, coach sir. 13 is an evil number. And I'm in the mood to kill. Go, get them! Sandeep Singh is returning to play international hockey. As a captain after a serious injury. I hope this doesn't prove to be another mistake of the selection committee. There comes the king of Shahbad, Sandeep Singh! A round of applause, please! There's my brave lad. And with that, the first half begins. Pakistan gets possession... Yusuf passes the ball to Tanveer. Stop it, stop it. GO, go! Good, good, good. And he targets his waist. Tanveer does an east-west dribble, moves forward... And a powerful strike. Pakistan scores its first goal.. Within the first 10 minutes of the game. Keep the tempo high, guys. It's just one goal. Sandeep and his team will have to come up with a new strategy. Sandeep... GO, go! Good job, good job. Jaffar, on the right... Get it, get it. Mind your foot. Short Corner. And a clever move to turn a simple pass into a Short Corner. You can see the determination on Sandeep's face. And that's a fantastic goal! Flicker Singh is back with a vengeance. A true warrior indeed. India one, Pakistan one. Go for the shot! Pakistan gets another opportunity to covert a Short Corner into a goal. Go, go, go. - Come on, Sunny! The atmosphere is tense. TanveerAlam challenging that he'll hit at the right corner. GO, go! And that's a powerful strike! TanveerAlam stuck to his promise.. Adding up to India's worries. Don't mess with us. It's bitter... but it's true, Mr. Chairman. Preeto aren't you going for the match. Pakistan's attack is at its peak at the finals. Come on, Sunny. What are you waiting for? Come on, come OH, COMB OH. Sandeep Singh plays aggressive hockey. Sandeep passes, and Raghuveer scores a goal! India is back in the game! My son is back in his form. No one can stop him from scoring goals now. You saw that? Amazing! He is doing drama. That's cheating. I'll come there and beat you up. He's threatening! Referee! Shut up. Let's see whether Sandeep Singh can convert this Short Corner into a goal.
