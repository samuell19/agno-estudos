(dramatic ambient music) (ominous electronic music) - The disease begins at the navel, and it trickles its little way into the immune system. It starts with dark circles around the eyes, stiff straw-like hair. By stage two of the disease, confusion. Paranoia set in. By stage three, deliria.

I've had him for 60 years, what did you do with him! - He's not here. - [Grandma] Open this door. Arrogant little brat! - He's not in here. - Every day it gets crazier in here. Where is he? - He's mine, grandma. - He's mine! - He's mine! (gasps) You put holes in him. What've you done? You put holes in him. Oh you outrageous brat! - No! - Whoa, yes, yes, yes. And this? - Grandma no, I promise. Remember, I did the dishes? - Yes, you did 'em terribly, had to do them over again. There's more to dishes than soap and water. - I'll do them better from now on, I promise. McGillicutty Bob is mine, he's mine! - He's mine, he's mine. Oh, see this, see this? - Grandma, no! - See it? - No! - You always got the door locked. What're you doing in here? Scheming? Dancing? Sick child, open your mouth. (Grandma yells) Colorful tongue, rotten teeth. (Grandma yells) Your whole life is abhorrent. You can keep this one. It reminds me of your personality. 60 years. - I think you'll be able to easily fix him, grandma. I mean I didn't think-- - He'll never be fixed. Never, never, never, never, never, never, never. Never, never! (sobs) Never. (ominous music) - Aimy, I think you've taken it too far this time. Why don't you go apologize to her, huh? - She'll cool off sooner or later, she always does. - Aimy, I need you to stop being so crazy for one minute. - I'm not crazy. - Okay. For some reason, this is how you've chosen to interact with people, but really do you think you could be that way when you're 35, 45? Really? You think you can get a job like that in the real world? I think if you go and sincerely... But I think if you go and sincerely apologize to her right now. Are you even listening to me? Here, let me give you some life advice. Respect your elders. (alligator roars) Oh, God. What did I do? You know what? I've got more important things to do than meeting at a tiff between you and your grandmother. I've got a doctorate thesis. An undergraduate advisory. Right now you can't even trust your own brain. No, no. Aimy, Aimy this is not funny. Aimy this is not a joke. - It's very funny. - Stay away, animal. - [Aimy] Come back you ass! (Aimy yells) - What business do you have touching your grandmother's possessions? What entitles you, child? - I had to let him out. For some air! - What entitles you to decide when it's let out for air? And stop poking your food and eat. - How much longer do you think we'll put up with this? It gets worse everyday. - There isn't a meaning behind it, mother. - That's right. - Nor a purpose. - I think that sometimes that she just acts without thinking. Ow, ow. - Why can't you all just accept me for who I am? - Get your hands outta the candy jar! - [Father] Sit down! - Just continue on, continue on. Just ignore her. (knocking) (Aimy giggles) - Now Aimy. I don't exactly know what's happened here with this doll, but I can see by the way it's been torn in half, and by the way-- - Mr. Bohringer, she tore my paintings into a million pieces. - Do not talk, Aimy. And I want you to sit down in that chair. We're gonna get something figured out, so everybody's happy and you can grow up to be the nice, sweet, lovely girl that you are. - 60 years. I had him for 60 years. - Actually, you've committed a felony. If this were my court, I could imprison you. - I would've stealed after the first day. I'll steal all the loot. (Aimy laughs) - Her voice, I can't take it anymore! Get down this instance! I know what you're doing all day, locked up in there. - [Father] Order in the court! - I'll fly away. - Stop spinning! Stop spinning this instant. - No! - It's outrageous. - Off with yourself! - Off with his head! - Oh no. Aimy, you need to stop spinning. - I must spin.

I heard about you all morning long over tea and biscuits. - Am I under arrest? - Your grandmother makes the most delicious biscuits. - She is a biscuit. - She's trying to get on your good side, commander. Don't listen to a word. And it's all because of these paintings. I should just burn them all. - Shoot her, shoot her! (thunder rumbling) - Where are the secret paintings? - If you knew about it, it wouldn't be a secret. - I believe she's hidden some paintings underneath her mattress. - Oh! Get up Aimy. Get up right now! Or we send you to jail, isn't that right commander? - Only a phone call away. In my early years, I used to overlook a ward of a the criminally insane. These pictures? They would fit right in. - [Grandma] Why do you think that is? - Look at the lines... - Yes. - The abstractions. In my view, these pictures relate to someone who is completely unstable. An unsound mind of startling proportions. The doctors are busy at this time, but yes. - Oh wait! (clock rings) - Why are you sitting there like that? Speak child, say words. - [Grandma] She doesn't want surgery. - I'm sure she'd rather rein goats! But we can't always get what we want. - Hey grandma, grandma I'm really sorry about yesterday. Daddy, it'll kill me. - Of course it's going to kill you. It's gonna kill the old Aimy. The one who destroys my mother's things, and only apologizes when she wants something. - I've been thinking a lot about how much I need to work on myself, and grandma if you delay the operation I'll make it up to you for the rest of my life! - She's been vying for sympathy all day. This is not how the world works, Aimy. - But I'm the world too. - Maybe. We're being a little bit too hard on her right now. Maybe she needs to rest, and think, and contemplate some-- - I want to paint! - [Grandma] Who would ever pay you to paint? - [Bohringer] Painting fences. That's the way to get paid for painting. - Hey Grandma. - This must be a real nightmare for you, Aimy. - It is a nightmare. No one's on my side. - I'm on your side Aimy. - Grandma wants me to get surgery. - I'll make sure, with all of my power, that I will not let you get any kind of surgery. You don't need it, it's not necessary. - Tell them that. Tell them that, Mr. Bohringer. Tell 'em I don't need surgery. - I promise. I'll do everything I can to make sure you don't get that surgery. Don't worry about it. You'll be okay. - I've been staying up past my bedtime, and talking back. I've been watching too much TV and stuff, and seeing things and shows that I know I'm not allowed to because it would make grandma mad. - [Nurse] She loved grandma. - [Aimy] Yes, I love her so much. - [Nurse] You say you hate her all the time. We've found your notebook. - No, no, no. I'm so grateful for everything she does for me. I know that not a lot of grandmas would put up with me. I know that if I was with any other family they would've put me out on the street a long time ago! - [Nurse] It's really good that you recognize this. It's going to be very helpful after the surgery. - Wait everyone, please! Cancel the surgery! Pack up your things and go home before morning traffic. It's not even breakfast yet, so it's not too late. I'm sure the insurance companies will still pay you for all the trouble you've gone through. - [Nurse] Grandma says you have no friends. - I know that I don't have any friends, but that's because I can't control myself. But that doesn't mean I have to be that way to my own family. Dr. Issie, I realize that. - [Dr. Issie] Give yourself more credit than that. - I'm being honest. That's why I'll take pills! I'll take 50 pills if you tell me. But since I'm being so honest with you, I don't even need surgery! If I was crazy, then I wouldn't know that I was crazy. - [Dr. Issie] Nobody said you're crazy, don't torture yourself. - What's that noise? Dr. Issie, I'm scared. Why can't we do it tomorrow? Can't we just do it tomorrow? Where's Steve? - [Dr. Issie] Prepare 50 milligrams-- - Mr. Bohringer said that I didn't have to. - Liar! - Grandma, I'm gonna get you for this!

They might have the Apollo Plague. What do you do? You want the Apollo strain in your school? - Baby Lewis' first words were neither mommy, nor daddy. In fact, he never uttered a word at all. - Amy, look up! - You want it in the meat that you eat? That you pack in the lunches for your child? This is the kind of plague that creeps in silently, while you sleep, while you dream. - I have ordered the most delightful chardonnay. I was hoping it would get here before my face creams, alas-- - Oh boy! - Oh, Steve. You are so wonderful. It's great to have a mathematician around. Would you like me to show you how to knit? - Everybody lift your bed up! - You would probably be wonderful. Tomorrow let's have a knitting lesson. (plate shatters) (frantic instrumental music) Steve? Can you hear me with those things on? - On the ceiling! - What a sweet boy you are. - Their noses!

(Aimy screaming) - Are you all right, sweetie? - [Aimy] Grandma! Where are you? (soft bell music) - My students, they've been coming up to me and saying, "Mr. Debinshire, are we all in danger?" So heartbreaking. That they're instilling all this fear into these children. - I agree, exactly. - I mean just look at the statistics that these researchers who dedicate their entire lives-- - Stupid scientists. - You can just tell it's going nowhere, this Apollo virus. - That's right. - Exactly. - The amount of TV exposure it has. You think it was already here. - Oh, look who's coming. - It's Aimy. - Hello. - Aimy, Aimy! You know what century we're in, darling? - Come here next to me. - [Grandma] You were so funny at the surgery. You had us all laughing. Wasn't she hysterical? - She was a hoot. - Oh, it was priceless. - Hands off the head. - Being so melodramatic. - Really means a lot how supportive you are. - Well that was positive. - A supportive family! - [Aimy] I'm absolutely normal now. - [Father] I'd say the surgery was a complete success. - I feel it's time for a bath, huh? Aimy, now open. - Aimy, I see you're a very wise investment. - Open your mouth. - You're so intelligent. - I don't even have a desire to put holes in grandma's dolls. Hands off the head! - [Grandma] You put a hole in my dolls and now I put a hole in yours! - Yes, she has a juvenile streak we're trying to milk out. - It's time for you to grow up, that's why I'm here. - Look at that appetite. That's the appetite of a sane person. - This Apollo virsus? Where do they come up with these names anyway? - Oh, it's like hurricanes, you know. - Because it has extra cheese. - [Mother] Aimy! - Yeah, dairy has a lot of calcium. - [Grandma] There she goes, goo. - Aimy, how about... - I think she said good. She was expressing her delight. (dinner guests chatting) - Elena, I put peas in there. Have some nutrients. (Aimy yells) - [Grandma] Good evening! - [Father] Well my dear, were those hunger pangs? (Aimy yells) - Hands off the head! - [Grandma] What I worry about is when she's 30-years-old and she's still playing with her crayons and seeing her friends. - [Mother] I will make sure that she's well married and pregnant.

Scoot southward. - You're a doll in a dress. - You're a doll in a dress. - You're a doll in a dress. - You're a doll in a dress. - You're a doll in a dress! - I'm taking away your doll.

We don't know what we're eating. - Then, you don't believe, she has been coming onto Claude, dancing with him. Thinks I don't notice. She thinks I don't notice? I know what the little tart has in her mind. - We have to learn to be aware, first and foremost. We have to be aware of our surroundings. (soft orchestral music) - Do you have any friends? - They stab me in the back. - What do you care about your back? You sleep on the floor. - Did you go through Wolwëurth? - No. Do you believe in any of this Apollo stuff? - I don't believe it for a second. - Me neither. - [Newscaster] Baby Lewis, the first infant stricken with the Apollo virus, is now showing new brain wave activity-- - Baby Lewis! No more baby Lewis! - [Newscaster] Shown on baby Lewis' brain. Full report after the program, we now return.

I'm baking, you know. - I just think it'd maybe be presumptuous of me to not at least bring a cod. - Look at her. Get that spoon off your face! - I worry, you know, that Claude doesn't have what it takes to make you happy. He's years your junior. - He has the biggest heart of any man I've ever met. You're gonna be a diabetic. - Diabetic! - We love you, honey. - The main course for tomorrow, I know just the one to make the most delicious-- - I'm a sugar monster! - Get off the table this moment! We have company! - No, you get up here! You want everyone to think I'm crazy, but you're just exaggerating everything I ever did. - You're trying to prove to everybody that you're normal? You could be a diplomat, you could be a judge on the Supreme Court. - I want to be a snake charmer. (light sitar music) - Go to your room. (Aimy yells) Oh Jackie, I'm so embarrassed. Will you accept my dearest apologies? - [Jackie] Please don't be embarrassed, absolutely I accept. - Oh, you're just the best friend a girl could ever have, and I appreciate that. Get up, bitch! (light orchestral music) - Aimy. I told you. I told that you're gonna battle for your mouth. You just listen. I told you that you had to be careful and you did not listen to me. Your grandmother is reaching into your head, and she's taking out every bit of your brain cell and she's putting it her own head to get in and it hurts you. And I don't want that to happen to you. I don't want it. If you tell me your secrets, you tell me what you need. You tell me what you want. - [Grandma] Claude, may I speak with Aimy? - I think you've got to do something. Aimy, she's been saying things that aren't true. If she's gonna keep doing that, I'm gonna go be in the bathtub and we're gonna sign that paper that we were talking about.

She's the worst thing that ever happened to me. The worst thing that ever could happen to a grandmother. She's a cancer in my life, a cancer. Get out!

I'll untie you and we can have a nice little conversation about atoms and quantum physics, dinosaurs, and all those things that you must be really interested in. - You'll untie me? - [Claude] Yeah, I just need to know where that piece of paper might be. - You're not afraid that I'm gonna run wild and stab everyone? - [Claude] I don't care what the hell you do, I just want to know about those pieces of paper, and then I'll untie you, but you gotta tell me now. - What else are we gonna talk about? - [Claude] Dogs, cats, animals, eyelashes, ducks, geese, whatever the hell you wanna talk about. Just tell me about those pieces of paper. - You promise? - Yes. - Promise you'll untie me? - Yes. - I don't know for sure, but sometimes I would see Grandma hiding things where she used to keep McGillicutty Bob. Mr. Bohringer, are we gonna talk? (somber violin music) - Are you ready to eat? - I'm not gonna eat anything from you. - Why not? - I don't want to eat anything from any of you. - We're worried about you, Aimy. You have to eat. - Then I'll starve myself. - That doesn't sound like a very good idea. If you don't eat, I'm gonna pry your mouth open and force it down your throat like a foie gras. - [Newscaster] Curfew's set for 6 pm. All violators will be arrested with one year minimum sentencing. (static hissing) - I have to go home now. No, no! - Calm down! - No, no! - Let me go! Let me go! - Kelly, calm-- Everything's fine. Everything's gonna be fine. (discordant drum music) - You okay? I can feed her, no problem. - She has to learn from me. - Yes, but you need sleep, look at yourself. What're you gonna need this for? You don't need this kind of stuff. I can help feed her. She's asleep. - She's faking it. - I don't know about that. Listen, I don't care about her. I only care about you getting your sleep. - I'll never let you guys sleep. - Aimy, just give me a second! - You're gonna have to gag me if you ever want to sleep. I'll never let you sleep, none of you! - Ignore her, ignore her. She's just in no state for this. (Aimy screams) - Stop it! Please stop it! Why won't you? - I'm never gonna eat anything from you, you robot! I'm never gonna eat anything. (both screaming) - Hey, hey, hey. Knock it off already. - Four days! She hasn't eaten in four days. - I'll never eat anything. I'll never eat. I swear to God I'll starve myself if you don't untie me. - Well go right ahead, it's not like we're getting fed either. - I'll kill myself if you don't untie me. - Go right ahead! What's up with that? Everyone wants to live, she wants to die. She just has to be different. Ken, you're gonna need the tube. - I'll eat. I'll eat, I'll eat, I swear I'll eat. I'll eat! Get it off me, get it off me! (Aimy screams) (sirens wailing) - [Newscaster] It blows under all conscious thought that infects its host. It starts with black rings around the eyes and breakdown of the muscle tissue. By stage two of the disease, skin peeling, paranoia, and restlessness. - Thank you for your silence today, Aimy. It shows me that you're making an effort. That I'm getting through. - Don't you even wanna hear my offer? - No I don't wanna hear your offer. No I do not. - I'm eating, I'm behaving. - From now on, it's me and you. That's it, no one else. - Don't say that please. - I can't even negotiate with-- - No, you're not gonna negotiate. (both screaming) - What's this little mutant saying now? - She's saying nothing. - [Father] A rehabilitated serial killer is easier than her. - Stay quiet, listen to my directions, and I'll be good to you. - I understand. Screw you! - Screw you! - Act belligerent and rebellious, refuse to eat, and they'll be problems between us. - I'll try my best. - People are dying, so what? Maybe they should. - Let her throw out her voice. - Enough with this back and forth retaliation. Just go get the tube, fix it, and feed her. - Maybe they didn't have what it takes. You see, as we're being seized by this epidemic, we're also being confronted with social Darwinism at its finest. - Oh, we feel so sorry for you, Aimy. Oh woe is for you. The world revolves around Aimy. - And we have to take this as an opportunity, as a gift, to look in. - Go on, try another one. Keep 'em coming. Keep on screaming! - [Newscaster] But where is the vaccine? How much longer do we have to wait? - [Announcer] They are behind on deliveries, but there is enough food to go around. - [Newscaster] The arrest of Dr. Issie Vandorf, head of a ring of underground surgeons performing the illegal and dangerous-- (screaming) (speaking foreign language) - Let her scream until her throat bleeds. (speaking foreign language) (cymbal ringing) - Here, have some. Here, you love your sweets. Here, have some sweets. - Right now, say this mantra and you will make it through this. I have the courage, say it. Say it with me now. I have the courage. (somber piano music) (Aimy wailing) (laughing) - Open your mouth. - No. - Open your mouth! No food? No food then, okay. Die of starvation. - I won't! - You won't what? - No! - No what, crazy girl? No what? - No, no, no! - Oh, no, no, no? - No! - Throw it out, throw it out! (both screaming) - I'm crazy! - Are you crazy? - I'm the craziest person who ever lived! - She admits it! - I'm the most worthless person who ever existed! - She understands! - I have nothing to offer anyone! (light electronic music) - What could we have here? - [Aimy] I'll eat! - I don't care. - I'll eat! - I don't care! - Molly. - Get out of here Kenneth. - I have a nosebleed. - One solid beating! - No! - One solid beating is what she needs. - She ate! - No, no, no! - One solid beating is what she needs! - You never did a thing of value in your entire life! - Get out of here Kenneth! One beating is what you need! (screaming) - Hey, hey, hey, stop! Stop it, stop it! Drop it! - Traitor! ♪ Ooh she is such a fool ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ And with the years ♪ ♪ She'd withered and faded ♪ ♪ But his shadow'd never crest the hill ♪ ♪ I'll be good to you ♪ (tense ambient music) - [Announcer] The virus string Apollo, classified HRGVX, is uncontrollable. The condition of marshal law is to be upgraded to the highest possible level. Emergency vaccination protocol will be implemented for a forced airway delivery. (Aimy screams) (upbeat orchestral music) - I can't do this anymore. She's killed my spirit. - Look-- - I don't wanna live anymore. - Oh stop, she's just an animal. Don't let her get to you. - Let's take her outside, like Kenneth. No one has to know. I just want to forget she was ever born. (Aimy screams) - Oh let it go, Kelly. (cymbal ringing) (garbled static) - Shame is a healthy response. It means I'm getting through. This is good news. Lift up your chin. Vibrate your throat. (Aimy hums) I think we're making a breakthrough. Shame is good news. I think your brain's starting to make the correct associations. - I've never had a teacher as effective as you. - And I have never met a girl so in need. The system completely let you down. It's astounding how you managed to slip through the cracks. It's astounding how lenient everyone's been. Your family denied the true extent of your condition. They deny just how sick a girl you really are. (sirens wailing) - Hand it to me. Stand. Did you look at Steve? - I didn't. - Did you intentionally look at Steve? - I didn't! - You've crossed me for the last time. (tense ambient music) Aimy! - You have to go. You have to go, you have to go, you have to go, you have to go, you have to go, you have to go, you have to go, you have to go, you have to go. You have to go! (cackling) It was inevitable. There's not enough food for us anymore. The authorities keep coming in and grabbing every grain of rice we get. And on top of all that, Kelly's pregnant. Isn't that fantastic? Bon voyage! - Where are you taking me? - None of your business. But I'm sure you'll love it. - Oh yes, you'll love it there. We're taking you to a place where you'll be-- - Among the rats. - Yes, they'll eat you alive! No, no, no, we were gonna eat you, but we can't eat you, you're too sour... - Oh, she wants a hug? - Yes, of course. There you go. - Have a great trip to hell! - Why was I even born? - Because even God needs a laugh. - You can't get rid of me, the neighbors will hear your baby crying. I can make lots of noise so you don't have to disguise the noise. - Shut up! - Kelly, you're gonna miscarry. You're gonna bleed to death-- - Know your place! Know your place, crazy girl! Crawl on your knees and beg for mercy. I will throw you out to the streets and let the plague swallow you alive! ♪ Ooh ♪ (light electronic music) ♪ And all she wanted to do ♪ ♪ Was to chitter chatter and chitter chatters too ♪ ♪ Chitter chatter and chitter chatters too ♪ ♪ Chitter chatter and God said yeah ♪ (growling) ♪ And all she wanted to do ♪ ♪ Was to chitter chatter and chitter chatters too ♪ ♪ Chitter chatter and God said yeah ♪ - Doctors, physicians, teachers, lawyers, politicians, mathematicians, we all have to die, and yet you get to live. That's why I've decided to give you an out. Go ahead, kill yourself. (laughing) This is hilarious. Hey, hey everyone. Aimy's trying to kill herself. Oh look at you, you're so precious. - I just wanna walk! - You wanna walk? - I just want some fresh air. - How many people have died because they wanted to take a walk? Kelly died because she wanted to take a walk. God help anyone whoever takes a walk. - Infect me. - Stay back you animal. - Infect me! (knocking) - No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. (muffled yelling) Oh no! What are you doing? Oh no, stop! Not the upholstery! The upholstery, not the upholstery! Don't hit the table please! Not the table, not the table, please! Oh no! Who's gonna pay for that? - Where's the women? - What women? They want women! (taser buzzing) - Well it's beautiful day on the town today, isn't it? I asked you... You need to raise your hands when you talk to me. You do it, but don't say a word, okay? That's your job now, do you understand? So you keep a good close eye on her, she might run. So we're here, we're family, we're all friends. We broke bread, we had dinner, and look what it got us. It got us nowhere. We still don't like each other. The room is empty, just like my soul. I told you to take care of him now! I am so tired of people just giving me the wrong answer! - He's okay! - What the hell happened to her? - She's infected. - No, I'm not infected. - Listen to me, she's infected. She's gone. - He's lying, I'm not infected. I'm not healthy! - Stand back! - I want this little one badly, man. - Just take her! - I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm so sick! I'm sick! - Yeah, I'm a mathematician, she's sick. - Guess it's all coming out of your rations. - Hey, I don't mean to offend anybody, but she's gonna infect you all and then you're gonna be taking it out on me. - Delirium, he needs to be taken. - No I surely disagree, I surely disagree! - Do not test me! - I just want to go. - You're not leaving here. So you can get that idea out of your head right now. You may not think that I can push you back in this suit. It my not seem flexible, but I assure you it is. I can box in this suit. We are taught different dance moves, like ballet, the tap dance, and even the Charleston. Pirouette, look everyone, I'm pirouetting. One, two, three, four. One, two, three. Do you see how I'm doing it everyone? Can you see it? It purrs! (playful instrumental music) (soft piano music) (light percussion music)
