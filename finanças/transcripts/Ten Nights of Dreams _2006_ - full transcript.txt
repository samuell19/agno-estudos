A Seventh Night of Dreams: Loneliness Directed by Yoshitaka Amano & Simmei Kawahara It is a tremendously large ship. Everyday, every night, It moves forward cutting through the waves, ceaselessly fuming back smoke. Ugh, ughm... Excuse me... Excuse me. Where is this ship heading? It looks as though it's going after the setting sun. Wait, wait a second. Please do listen to me. Hey, hey!! End of the sun that heads toward the West, it that East. Is that ture? Of false? Excuse me... Home of the sun rising from East, is that West? Or is that the middle? Bodies on the waves. Rudder on the pillow. Let it flow, let it flow. Not a single person takes a look at me... Just where is it that this ship is heading? The color of the ocean is blue. Even looks purple. Around where the ship moves is always pure white bubbles What is this unbearable solitude... that linger on a ship like this... Should I die Wonder if it hurts to die... Can I sit here? Oh, sure, sure. Someone like you is on the board as well. I... Even single person I talk to shows completely no interest, you are the first one who talked to me. Where is this? What? Uncle, Who are you? Don't call me uncle... It feels kind of awkward here... Yes, year I know. I was feeling the same way... What am I doing... She's alone, too. Fells insecure and anxious. Everyone is indifferent in this world. There is no one who would really care about me... But, only if I could talk to them properly... Where did she go? What's that... What is this place? Ouch! Is that her? Ha. She has immersed herself pretty well. Good for her, she can find a place to belong to like that. But I... This uneasiness, I can't be a jack-of-all-trades like her... This city where everyone is snuggled up to each other to relieve their loneliness, what is it to live... What is it to live... Is this called living? Keep lying to oneself like this and devouring time that passes by in mediocrity? Opps. Look, you can't always have it your way. Everyone is just being moved by something larger than onself. One wants to believe that he or she is special, but the time will come when one realizes that is not the case in the end. I know that, but still there's this part of me that is awkward. To die is to become nil? But, what is this pounding of my heart? Am I alive? It is so strange. I'm just even sure whether it was my own will that I had jumped. But I do want to live, as it is now. Didn't realize, the world is so vast. As he steps forward to find out what happens, deep black ocean awaits. Releases his Heart that is still in captivity, slowly falls toward what lies beyond infinity. The End An Eighth Night of Dreams: Imagine Directed by Nobuhiro Yamashita That's huge!

He's alive! Are you alright? Ken, isn't that my panama hat? Yes, you're right. Sorry about that. How on earth did you make it back What happened? - I'd rather not say. Hey... On second thoughts, I haven't much time. I'd best tell the story. Look There's Shotaro again with his panama hat and cane. He only works afternoons. What a loafer. He's the best looking kid in town, and he's got a good heart. Women come from miles around to see him. But all he does all day is stare out at the street. What's he's thinking? Look, here's another one I bet she comes just to look at him, too. His business does well. The luck of the handsome. No matter who it is, he keeps his cool. That's what you get for being upright. The ugly have no right to live! Go to hell, you ugly pig! Excuse me. Excuse me? When the mysterious Yoshino appeared, Shotaro left town as if bewitched.
