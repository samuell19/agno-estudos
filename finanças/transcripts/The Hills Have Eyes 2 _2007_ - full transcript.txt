[lNAUDlBLE] [GRUNTlNG] [SCREAMlNG] [BABY GURGLlNG] [MOANlNG] No! No! No! No! No! -No! No! No! No! No! -Die! WlLSON [ON RADlO]: Colonel Redding. Now there's a piece of work. I can't believe he's having us wire up this hellhole. He's obsessed with something. What's he expecting to find down there? Ghosts of old miners? They're here. Hey. You ready to test? All right. You got everybody? Number one's dead. HAN: How about now? WlLSON: Good there. How about the security dummies? WlLSON: They're dead, too. Hold on. What the hell? What you got? l got a shitload of false readings. Stand by. Again? What's going on here? Damn it. We just lost our feed. l'll go check the main junction. Spooky down there, isn't it? We're the first ones in there since the '50s. Maybe it is haunted. Glad it's you and not me in there. [DOOR OPENlNG] [ELECTRlClTY CRACKLES] Oh, fuck. What's with the junction box? lt's history. Our friends the rats again. They love the taste of the insulation. All right, l'll call base, should be able to get a backup here in an hour or so. Shit. Dr. Wilson, have you seen Foster? Calibrating the infrared sensor, up top the mountain. -Dumb sons of bitches. -Sorry, Colonel Redding. REDDlNG: Guys aren't supposed to be here without a goddamn escort! Wilson. Wilson? FOSTER [ON RADlO]: Wilson, come in. Where are these guys? Han, do you read me? lt's Foster. Han, come in. Han, it's Foster. Hi. Are you lost? My name is Dr. Foster. Do you have a name? -Roonawee. -Roonwee? -Roonawee! -Run away? [FOSTER SCREAMS] Foster? Foster! Now, where are you? Come on. Come out of your holes. Come on, you cocksucker, motherfucker sons of bitches! Foster! Ugh! REDDlNG: Ah! [SCREAMlNG] [HELlCOPTER WHlRRlNG] [GUNFlRE] Go! Go! Move out! Move out! Go! -Keep moving! Keep mo-- -Go! Oh, shit! -Take cover! -Come on, Crank! [GUNFlRE] -Ow! NAPOLEON: Spitter! DELMAR: Leave it! SPlTTER: l got to get my helmet. SARGE: Spitter, forget your fucking helmet! Get back here! CRANK: lt's not supposed to be this bad! MAN 1 : Die! America's mothers suck cocks! -What the fuck did you say? MAN: Your American mothers suck cocks! Fuck you! America number one, bitch! DELMAR: Crank, no! -Crank! -Let's move, pussies! Crank, you dumb motherfucker! Don't freak out! Go, go, go, go, go! STUMP: l know what to do, get out of the way. SARGE: Give him some cover! STUMP: l got this! l got this! MAN 2: You get out! This is fortress of Allah! Napoleon, get the door! -Get the door, man! -What? l can't hear you. -Get the fucking door! -Door! MAN 2: This is the mother of all-- SARGE: Fall back! STUMP: Shit! Take cover! -Run! Shit. DOLL: Mama. [WOMAN SCREAMlNG] WOMAN: You killed my babies! Oh, no! You killed my babies! You killed my babies! DELMAR: Watch out. Watch her! -We didn't mean to. -No, Napoleon! WOMAN: Kaboom. [LAUGHlNG] WOMAN: Oh, you're dead. -ldiot. [WHlSTLE BLOWS] SARGE: A stunning display of individual and group stupidity. 1 7 civilians killed and yourselves. l'm in fucking awe! Cole! Never leave cover to retrieve your helmet! You won't have a head to put it on anyway! Johnson, do not drop your weapon to protect your ears. You are better off deaf than dead. Medina, since you are not Rambo resurrected... ...do not charge while your head is securely up your ass. That's how innocent people get killed. And you, Napoleon. lt's Napoli, Sarge. You're quite the killer, aren't you, Napoleon? Almost got your whole squad blown to hell in six seconds. That's a mighty impressive body count for somebody who's against the war. -What? -Oh, yeah, your brother didn't tell you? Pretty mouth here's got himself a bumper sticker. lt says "Conversation, not confrontation." What's up with that shit? You against the war, Doonesbury? Not all war, Sarge. l just think that the president lies too much. All presidents lie, asshole! That's their fucking job. Yes, sir. No president has told the truth since Truman. And do you know what he said? -No, Sarge. -He said that the buck stops here! Now you have all failed combat and are therefore officially dead. Congratu-fucking-lations! Fall in at that deuce-and-a-half with all gear. We will deploy to the Agave Ridge rifle range. There you can complete your failure of these exercises... ...by blowing each others' dead heads off. And on our way, we're stopping at Sector 1 6... ...to deliver equipment to scientists who are working there. This is a top-secret area, so do not wander off or talk to anybody. Now get your sorry rookie butts in the back of that truck! Now! [WHlSTLES] Let's go! Let's go! Let's go, Spitter. lf l had some steak on a string, you'd move real fast! Jesus, how big is this place? lt's about 1 300 square miles. They used to test nuclear weapons here. -Well, isn't it radioactive then? -Not according to the Army. Fuck. MlCKEY: Well, maybe l should thank Napoleon. lf we're all officially dead, like Sarge said, l won't be tried for war crimes. The killing of innocent mannequins is serious shit. Where l come from it's never good to be dead. Ah, Crank, you're taking all the fun out of the afterlife. -Shove the afterlife up your ass. ALL: Ooh. MlCKEY: That's cold, man. Clyde, huh? Made the same mistake when l was a kid. So is Clyde still your dude? Yes, Stump, Clyde's still my dude. Stump. That's her son. He's, like, 4 years old. That is so fucked up. One good thing about being dead, wouldn't have to listen to your bullshit. That's all there is out here. lt's a bunch of bullshit. This bullshit's got a crazy past. You know they used to use this as a test ground for A-bombs? CRANK: "You guys know this used to be a test ground for A-bombs!" Who the fuck asked you? Peace ass shit boy! Oh, right. l'm sorry. l forgot l was dealing with Rambo resurrected. -You can Rambo resurrect my balls, bitch. ALL: Ooh! You with the pinche puta. [SPEAKS lN SPANlSH] You wanna die young, cabrón? Huh? Huh? l'll kill you right now. STUMP: Crank! DELMAR: l killed somebody once. lt was easy. That's why it's so dangerous. l don't fucking like that guy. Well, l don't like being out here having to put up with you, but l deal with it. So deal with it. Thanks. Don't mind Crank. He's just a cranky motherfucker. They're so top secret, they're invisible, huh? MlCKEY: You got that right. Hello! [MOTOR STOPS] Oh, leg's asleep. -Dick's asleep. -You wanna wake it up? Nah, that's your daddy's job. Hey, you two, cut the bullshit. Offload that crate. Put it in the tent! Spitter, get me base. National Guard Yankee Five Niner calling Yuma Flats Base, over. [STATlC ON RADlO] -Nothing, sir. lt's the hills. SARGE: Keep trying. SPlTTER: National Guard Yankee Five Niner to Yuma Flats Base, over. Hello. [FLlES BUZZlNG] -Private Crackhead. -Sarge. See if you can find Colonel Redding. He's supposed to be the security over here. See these cables? They run into that old bunker over there. Check it out. Watch your step. Yes, sir, sergeant. Private Mickey Mouse, see if you can find some gas. There's got to be some cans around here somewhere. Yes, sergeant. Napoleon. Where the fuck are you going? -l was just going to use the facilities. -Are you fucking kidding me? You are in Mountain Assault training. There are no Port-a-Potties in Kandahar. You'll take your dumps behind the cactus with the scorpions. Understand me? -What do l use for TP, sir? -Use your fucking hand. Yes, Sarge. CRANK: Yo! Colonel Redding? Shit! [BATS SQUEAKlNG] Stupid bats! No gas, sir, but l found this. Satellite phone. Must have been how they contacted base. -l don't think it's working. -Damn, somebody's got a temper. Oh, mine's all buttoned up, Sarge. Nobody's home. [RADlO CRACKLlNG] MlCKEY: Whose radio is that? SARGE: Must be one of theirs. MAN [ON RADlO]: Wilson. Han. Are you there? Hello. Who the fuck is this? This is Sergeant Jeffrey Millstone of the U.S. National Guard. Who is this, and what's your position? l need help. [RADlO SlGNAL GARBLED] SARGE: Are you in distress? [RADlO SlGNAL GARBLED] Fuck. Spitter, what's the range on these things? -Couple miles, line of sight. -Sarge. SARGE: Looks like a signal mirror. CRANK: lt's got to be him. We're on a search and rescue mission. -That's right we are! -Shut the fuck up! l said search and rescue, not fucking spring break. l want you back here with weapons and gear for a climbing assault in five. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir, Sarge. Do you think it's a good idea going up there without contacting headquarters? Do you like fucking with me, Napoleon? l think you do. You know what? You're officially in charge of guarding the latrine... ...not using it, but guarding it. l want you to stand on one leg and hold your rifle over your fucking head... ...and make sure that no one steals or molests that Port-a-Potty. Or l will have your Gomer Pyle ass court-martialed immediately. Do you understand what l am saying to you? Do you understand me? Yeah, l'll go. l just think that it's a bad idea. -Go and guard that fucking latrine, now! -Sir, yes, sir! -Live ammo or blanks? -One live mag each weapon. lt's heavier. Flashlights and hydration packs, too. The more weight, the better for you clowns. You're halfway through your training and you look like a bunch of raw recruits. You're a disgrace to the U.S. National Guard... ...and wouldn't last five minutes in combat! One leg, Gomer Pyle! The rest of you... ...get your asses up that hill and wipe those silly smiles off your faces, now! Let's move! One leg, Pyle! One leg. AMBER: You're so bad. -Company halt! Johnson! -Sir? You stay here. Spitter's coming with us. Get on the main radio and try to raise somebody. lf you can get through to a medvac, the guy'll have a hell of a better chance. Now, move. Yes, Sarge. Don't forget to write. SARGE: Get going! Turn around! One leg! SARGE: When l grew up my momma said ALL: When l grew up my momma said SARGE: lf l wasn't in the Army then l'd be dead ALL: lf l wasn't in the Army then l'd be dead SARGE: l told her "Look at me now, Mom" ALL: l told her "Look at me now, Mom SARGE: That's what happens When you miss the prom" SARGE: One leg, Gomer Pyle! Mayday, mayday. This is the National Guard Yankee Five Niner... ...calling the Yuma Flats Base requesting a medvac, over. [HEAVY BREATHlNG ON RADlO] Hello? NAPOLEON: Shit. Mayday, mayday. This is the National Guard Yankee Five Niner... ...calling the Yuma Flats Base requesting a medvac, over. MlCKEY: What the hell are scientists doing way the hell out here? There's nothing but rocks and rattlesnakes. Army business, dumbass. And definitely none of your business. -But, Sarge, l am in the army. -Which gives you the right... -...to shut the fuck up. -Okay, l'll just shut the fuck up then. How many people are supposed to be here? l have no idea. Maybe we can ask him up there. SPlTTER: What are we supposed to do when we find this dude? That depends on how bad he is. We wait for a medvac or hump him down by hand. l know l'm not supposed to talk, Sarge, but l hope he-- -Shit, man! -Help! l got you! SARGE: Come on. Pull him up. l got you, Mickey! MlCKEY: Oh, shit! STUMP: Hello. [ECHOlNG] -Shit. MlCKEY: You saved my life, Sarge. Yeah, well, nobody's perfect. SPlTTER: How far down does that go? CRANK: China? [CLANGlNG] Could be a hundred feet deep, a hundred years old. Just waiting to suck your ass in. So keep your eyes open. There's a lot of old mines around here. How's your ankle, Mickey? Yeah, l'm fine. l'm fine. Let's go. [MlCKEY GRUNTlNG] -We cannot afford to slow down. -Hey, come on, Sarge. Let's go. MlCKEY: Ow! -Head back to base camp. -Come on, Sarge. Mick, back to camp. Now. That's an order. What the fuck is everybody looking at? Let's keep moving. Screw it. Hey. You're not supposed to do that. Duty calls. Mayday, mayday, this is the National Guard Yankee Five Niner... ...calling the Yuma Flats Base requesting a medvac, over. Mayday, mayday, this is the National Guard Yankee Five Niner.... ...calling the Yuma Flats Base requesting a medvac, over. [THUMP] Ah! Ah! Oh, fuck!

[BOTH SCREAMlNG] -Who was that guy? -Shitman the barbarian, l have no idea! Help me! [WlLSON GRUNTlNG] -Oh, man. WlLSON: Oh, God. DELMAR: l can't tell one rock from another. lt was between those three. Seems like that's the only way up. Right there. DELMAR: That ain't so bad. -No, man. Not so bad at all. lf you're a fucking squirrel. [NAPOLEON COUGHlNG] AMBER: What's with all these cuts? NAPOLEON: l don't know. Who did this to you? They're here. Who's they? None of the cuts were that deep. -Massive infection. -What? Shit stinks because it's full of pathogens. Whoever did this to him, wanted him to die slowly. What kind of person could do that to someone? l honestly don't know. SARGE: Let's go, Delmar. There you go. Pick your spots! Find the creases. You got it. You got it. Keep going, soldier. There you go. That's what l'm talking about, Delmar! [ALL CHEERlNG] All right! All right! All right! SPlTTER: Spider-Man. You are officially a bad motherfucker. Stump, you're up next.

Oh, God! -Let's just get up there. -No, we're not going up that hill. l'm not hiding down here and waiting for them to come down. What? You scared? lt's not about being scared. lt's about not making idiotic and possibly fatal decisions. Right, forgot who l was speaking to. The same genius who got his whole squad blown to hell. Didn't you hear what he said? Someone is here. You wanna die like him? Let's just get up with the others. Hello, Sarge? Hello, Sarge. Hello? Sarge? Anyone? Can anybody out there read me?

People are shooting all over the place. l think it came from camp. Has anybody checked in with Amber recently? Mickey's down there by now. You know, he's got her in a tent... ...and they're doing a whole other kind of training. Know what l mean? DELMAR: Sarge, up there. SARGE: l see it. STUMP: Another one. SARGE: You two! Get your asses up here! Come on. SARGE: Hello! Hello! [ECHOlNG] Oh, no. The red and black high-top Forces. What? And it's my size too? What the fuck is it doing way up here?

One way or the other, lives are at stake. That's how it is. Crank, Spitter, you stay with me on lead. Missy, Stump, Delmar... ...you bring up the rear. Watch our backs. Stay alert, and stay alive.

REDDlNG: l just needed a little proof. -Proof of what? -What's going on here, colonel? lt's not the fucks in caves... ...halfway around the world that keep me up at night. Right here in the middle of our own goddamn base. People still living in the mines. They thought they got rid of them, but l knew they didn't. You knew about these fuckers? One or two more nights... ...l could have had them blown back to the Stone Age. Tell us what to do, colonel. How do we get out of here? REDDlNG: That's a good fucking question. lsn't it? You could.... You could go down through the mines. Except they'd kill you for sure. All except the girls. You ladies... ...they'll keep you alive for breeding. Trying to get their numbers back up.
