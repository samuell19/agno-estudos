["Season of the Witch" by Donovan] * When I look out my window * Many sights to see * And when I look inside my window * So many different people to be * That it's strange * It sure is strange * You've gotta pick up every stitch * Oh, oh, oh, oh * Must be the season of the witch * Must be the season of the witch * Must be the season of the witch ["You Really Got Me" by The Kinks] *** * Girl, you really got me going - Hi. - Hi. * You got me so I don't know what I'm doin' now Hello, I'm Jim. - Hi, Angie. - Jim Roberts. - So nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Are you a doctor yourself? - Well, kind of. - Yeah. I have an academic interest-- Oh wow. - In the field, yes. - I can tell. Yes. I can, I can introduce you to him if you'd like. Me? - Yeah. - Oh wow. [laughs] [applause] * You really got me. * You really got me. Let me tell you about Julie. Ah, by the time I'd met her, she'd been in a, a mental hospital or a bin for nine years. She was mostly mute. She was labeled a chronic schizophrenic. When she did speak, she spoke in what's called schizophrenise which is a language which is apparently nonsensical, but if anyone does actually look, care to look, it does actually make sense. Anyway, she had a very difficult relationship with her mother, who only responded positively when Julie behaved perfectly, so Julie never had any difficulties with eating or sleeping or teething, potty training, walking or talking. She was like an automaton. But she felt that her true self was being murdered. "I wasn't mothered, I was smothered. "She wasn't a mother, she was killing me, "she was cutting out my tongue." Because her mother didn't let her develop, to become independent, Julie saw her as a destructive black sun blocking out all life. [siren wailing] - Freak! [indistinct shouting] [banging] - Give me the knife. Put it down. Raymond, put it down. Raymond put it, drop it! [shouting] [knife clanking] [Raymond sobbing] Come on. Alright? You alright? Yeah? Shall we go for dinner? Shall we? Come on, good man, let's go. That's it. Well we're all here to support each other, so that, you know, but that also means you can, you can decide to engage or not engage as you see fit. Everyone has their own space which they can retreat to. You have your own private space that you can get away? Everyone does, everyone here has their own space. Mm, that's nice. I think that's important, to give that sense of security. We're very much one community, one, one group of people living together as best we can. But sometimes you need to, you need to be able to be by yourself. I think that's important. Why did you say mothers make their children schizophrenic? I get angry when people misquote me. I never said all mothers make their children schizophrenic, I never said all families are bad, despite what those fuckers say. Which fuckers? Those fuckers out to get me. Raymond is enjoying some role play. He's Jesus, I'm Pontius Pilate. He thinks I am going to wash my hands of him, which I won't do. What's wrong with him? Ask him. There are many people like Raymond claiming to be the messiah and they are incarcerated, electrocuted, drugged, restrained, imprisoned against their will. Why was he in prison? Nah, it's not prison it's a hospital. Oh. It's meant to be a cure not a punishment. I had no idea. Is it true you don't prescribe any drugs? [Ronnie] No tranquilizers, no, no sedatives of any kind designed to deaden the mind. And her? She does have a name you know. Maria? Maria, do you want to come talk to our friend here? Maria gave birth to a wee boy, and what should have been a happy time became something very unhappy and she descended into darkness and she was diagnosed with what we call postpartum depression. [Maria] Bless you my child. Maria is a high priestess. What do you do with someone like Raymond? What would you like me to do? Well, he frightens me. So he should be locked up because you're afraid? [Raymond chanting to crucifix] He's banishing your demons. You need to come visit us again. [Jane] Oh, I'd like that. It was very interesting. Is that good interesting or bad interesting? Interesting's a very interesting word. I found it quite humbling. Truth be told. Well that's alright. Come on then. [patient whimpering] [soft guitar music] [phone ringing] Hello? - Hi, Dr. Laing? - Yeah. [Angie] Is this Dr. Laing? Speaking. [Angie] Hi, erm, my name is Angie Wood. Mm hmm. [Angie] Jim Roberts gave me your number. Does Jim think you need to come see me? [Angie] No, I was at your lecture actually. Will you be coming to any more of my lectures? [Angie] Erm, I, I don't know. I, I was so impressed by, by what you said. I'm a postgraduate student of psychology at Columbia. - Mm hmm. - In New York. I know where it is, yeah. [Angie] Of course you do, [mumbles] it's in New York. [laughs] I'm so stupid. No not at all, you sound charming, you sound like someone I should probably be having lunch with. [Angie] [laughs] Yeah, Jim said you'd say that too. You know Lexington Street? [Angie] Yeah, sure. * So tired, tired of waiting * Tired of waiting for you You must be Angie. Hi. Oh. [laughs] What, are you made of electricity? You want me to answer that as a scientist or a psychiatrist? Sorry, I'm just a little nervous. [Waiter] Something to drink? - Just some Chianti. - Very good. So why are we here? Well I was so impressed and just amazed at your lecture, and Jim said you'd meet me if I asked, so. I guess you already know that part. [Waiter] Would you like to try? I'm sure that's fine. First of the day. How well do you know Jim? Oh, he's the first and only time I've met him was at your lecture. My PHD is on gestalt therapy and that kind of thing. And I've just, I've read so much about your work and your books. But not actually read any of 'em? [laughs] Well, I've been meaning to, I just... Well at least you were impressed, amazed at my lecture. You're not taking me very seriously are you? We won't be eating. [man moaning] [both breathing heavily] - Where do you actually live? - Here. Here, here? Aye, this is home. I thought you just worked here. Well, that too. A little girl of 17 in a mental hospital told me she was terrified because the atom bomb was inside her. That is a delusion. The statesmen of the world who boast and threaten that they have doomsday weapons are far more dangerous and far more estranged from reality than many of the people on whom they label psychotic is affixed. Not wrong though am I? Normal fucking man has killed 100 million of his fellow normal man in the last 50 years. Whatever happened to her? [Ronnie] Long time ago. I don't know, she might still be there. Couldn't she come here? I mean, maybe she could get some help here? Hang around, you'll find out. Oh I bet you say that to all the girls. [Ronnie] Aye, I do. [laughing] Sorry, I'm already late. [Angie] Patient? No, my kids are down from Glasgow. Children? I didn't, I didn't realize you were married. You didn't ask. So your wife... If it makes you feel any better we're gettin' divorced. No, doesn't. What, you'd rather sleep with a happily married man? Please don't twist my words. So, why are you getting divorced? Because we don't love each other or even like each other anymore. And the children? Do you, do you not love or even like them anymore? I love my children. If you loved them you'd stay. What the fuck do you know? I've read about the effects of divorce on children. Well then you'll know that growing up in a so-called fucking happy family can destroy some people. I've seen what families do to each other and I'm not puttin' my children through that. A coward walks away. No, a brave man walks away. I'm sorry. [somber piano music] [whimpering] [crying] [moaning] [moving to soft guitar and drums music] No! [electricity crackling] [man moaning] [man moaning] Mrs. Holding, I, I know it looks dreadful, but let me assure you. You can't even tell me how it works. No. No, you're right, I can't. That's because we don't know exactly why it works. But believe me, it does work. And it will work for John, if he's allowed to stay. Well, think of it a little like mending a broken radio by giving it a firm slap on the hand. But Johns not a radio. He's my son. It hurts him, and he isn't better. What are you thinking? [Woman] A visit to a mental institution, book signing, you know, that kinda thing. What a week, two weeks, what? [Woman] Yeah something like that. Is that okay? - Yeah. [Woman] You know, radio, TV. I'm going to have to call you back about all this. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. [Woman] Yeah, if you could call me back, that'd be great. [Ronnie] Yeah, we'll speak soon, we'll speak soon. [Woman] Okay, cool. Okay, bye. - Bye bye. So I was thinking I could maybe make this place more kinda homey. You still here? What did you have in mind? Well, would you like it to be more homey? I have to forgive you first. That's true. Oh, I see. I don't want you moving anything. Don't fucking move anything. I won't touch a thing. Everything is in a very particular place. [laughing] Is it? You'll note my filing system here. It's very... It's very unique. Worked out to a micron. [laughing] [chiming] [Raymond whimpering] Raymond. Raymond, Raymond. Follow your breathing, follow your breath, yeah? [Raymond exhaling deeply] That's it. That's it. [Raymond whimpering] [girl moaning] [knocking] Mr. And Mrs. Holding. John? Do you want to come through? Hello, Raymond. This way. John. Mr. and Mrs. Holding. I'm Dr. Laing. I believe you've already met Dr. Zemmell. He hears voices. Or at least we think he does. I think Dr. Meredith means well but I-- So why are we here? I'll be honest. I have great concerns about leaving John here. We saw somebody eating what looked like cat food. Some people say you are experimenting on your patients. But I want John to be safe, not in a mental hospital. I know I can't help him at home. According to Dr. Meredith, you're a catatonic schizophrenic. John, could you at least tell me what you want? I want my own room. And what will you do in there? John, we will be able to give you a room, although here we call them cells. Erm, from the Latin cellar, sort of a small room where a, like where a nun or a monk sleeps. We'll take it from there, does that sound okay? Yeah. So how will you treat him? We'll give him what he wants, we'll give him a cell. And if he wants to talk, we'll listen. And that's it? Yeah. [gentle guitar music] Come on. Mama was struggling. She held onto him, kept saying please don't, please don't please, please don't. [crying] I was just a little boy of seven. I saw it all. I, I can't get rid of the smell of... Sydney, I'll try and help you let go of this. I can't promise it will be easy. Thank you. [upbeat rock music] *** You remember Jim? Jim, of course, good to see you again. Something I said? Jim's a wee bit down, so he's gonna come back and spend some time with us again. And Aristotle, you know, for whom I have great time by the way, he maintains that the brain is mostly composed of water, and if the moon can affect the tides, what, what can it do to the human brain? Won't be long now. Won't be long for what? The moon. The moon. The moon, stupid bitch. Hey, didn't your mother teach you any manners? Don't you talk about my mum. There's a sculpture in Ireland that's 5,000 years old that's a depiction of the moon. Yeah, me mother was Irish. A lot of people say there are more suicides, murders, and admissions to mental hospitals during a full moon. [RD and Jim howling] [upbeat rock music] [Angie laughing] [howling] [Bartender] Hey, hey! [glass shattering] [indistinct shouting] Get out! Get out! I'll fucking kill you. That's enough, let's go home. It's alright, it's all good. John? [knocking] John, it's Paul. I'm extremely concerned. As are we. Then use chlorpromazine, or a feeding tube. Give him ECT. At Kingsley Hall we take the Hippocratic Oath very seriously, and the promise not to do harm. If I was to tie John down and administer electricity to his brain or fill him so full of drugs he couldn't speak, would I be doing him good or would I be doing him harm? [knocking] John? John? What do you suggest I tell his parents? They're not my concern. John? [upbeat music] [indistinct singing] So hard to get away from the noise, Frank. You'd imagine at this time of day they'd be quiet. That's all you want really, is a bit of peace and quiet. Hey? How have you been today, Frank? A little bit down are you? Yeah. Do you know what I think, Frank? Will we have a, will we have a little bedtime poem? Yeah, why don't we do that. Let's take up from where we left last night. Ah yeah. But if my heart must break for your sake it will break in music I know. Poets' hearts break so, but strange I was not told that the brain could hold in a tiny ivory cell, God's heaven and hell. So true that, isn't it, Frank? You're so soft. Oh, that makes me calm. [soft piano music] [John muttering indistinctly] [knocking] John? John, I think it's time you and I had a little chat. [John muttering] What the fuck is all this about? [objects rattling in jar] John? You know you can talk to us. John, when you're ready, just come and find us. [clock ticking] [Angie exhaling deeply] - Raymond! - You must see Maria. You must see Maria. - Shit! - You must, you must! Raymond this had better be fucking important. [Angie] I'll be waiting. Alright, alright, give me that, give me that. Take that. Alright, here. [Maria whimpering] [whacking] [Raymond blowing] Would you like me to get in touch with Isaac's father? No. He didn't want Isaac. He was only interested when I started going mad. Then he took him away. But he was right, I can't look after a child. None of this is your fault. I can't. Some tribes believe that there is a, a spirit in the placenta, the amniotic fluid, and that if that spirit gets unhappy for whatever reason, then that causes the mother to experience frequent crying, and loss of appetite, difficulty sleepin', and that is exactly what we would call postnatal depression. How did they cure her? Well they would summon a Shaman to perform a seance to make the spirit leave. Do it. Do it. Do it, please, do it. Do it. - Do it. - No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a shaman, Maria. - Yes, yes you are. Do it, do it please, do it. Please do it. [crying] We must hold hands. You do it, you do it. Yes, yes. Please, please, please! Can I say something, Angie? [Angie] Uh huh. If you, please don't be offended. [Angie laughs] I really like you. Yeah, you've got a beautiful quality about you. [Angie] Oh wow. [laughing] And you're very, very compassionate. Lovely compassionate quality, like Ronnie has. He has that same quality. I can see why you two, you know, gravitated towards each other. Maybe. You've got a lovely smile. Pffft. Yeah, it comes from somewhere deep, you can tell. Now you're fibbing. [laughing] Yeah, it's the truth, it's the truth. I like you too Jim. Well, thank you. So I'll get back to me... Thanks for talking to me Angie. [Angie] Thank you. Angela, Angelis. [both laughing] Boing, boing. Do you remember that when you were kid, the angelus? Don't you find that time is completely different in here? Like outside it's like, whurrrrrrr. In here it's calm, calm. Except sometimes when I hear these voices and they start telling me to do things, you know, like, they start in a whisper and then they get louder and louder and then, like my head is going to explode and I say fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, alright! I'll do it! [Angie] What do they tell you to do, Jim? Oh, you don't want to know what they tell me to do. [blows through lips] Sometimes they have a bit of a laugh with you, sometimes they say like obscene things. Other times they're telling you to do things that you just know, you're just like fuck no, don't want to do that. And they're always laughing afterwards. Yeah, you see we made you fucking do it. Hmmm. Anyway, today is a good day, it's a good day. [Angie] No voices today? No voices today, no writing on the walls. Well, no. [Angie laughing] Anyway, thanks for listening to me Angie. Erm, if, if Ronnie went away, I don't know what I'd do. I know. [Jim] Because, like, sometimes you know this thing in my head tells me that if you take him away, I don't mean you to take this personally but that if you take him away, then they're kinda telling me that I'd have to take you away. Loonies, loonies! [laughing] Loonies, loonies! [banging] Loonies. [bottle shattering] [laughing] [girl whimpering] I'm 73, I've never ever taken drugs, and, well, I've heard LSD sends you mad. You're among friends. What have you to lose? But, I don't want to go mad. LSD is controversial, but it can have a profoundly valuable and therapeutic effect if you take it in a controlled environment. It might help you deal with your memories. It might just unblock them. People who've revisited memories like you, sometimes it just, they can find an inner peace, they can face up to it. What do you think, do you trust me? I do trust you, yes. Want to try it? No, but, I will. Alright. Here. That's it, a couple drops. There you go. Just try and relax. How long does it take? Could be 10 minutes, could be a couple hours. See what happens. - Nothing yet. - No. [whimsical music] I think I'm seven. *** I can smell something. [woman crying] I can't, I can't. [crying] [woman screaming] [item clanking] [orchestral music] *** Please, please, please, please. * Ahhh! [knife blade slicing] Please, please, please! - No! - I'm sittin' with you. It's me, Sydney. You're alright, you're safe. It's me and Ronnie. [mystical music] [vocalizing] Some terrible things happen in the name of love. Well I love you Ronnie. Do you love me? Love's a terrible burden to inflict on someone. What's the matter? You know Syd's mother died 'cause she loved him so much? I don't think my mother would've died to save me. She didn't even want anyone to know she was pregnant. Maybe she didn't want me. Certainly don't remember her ever kissing me, or holding me or puttin' her arms around me. Our house was not a place of love. Where was your dad? Doctors said it was overwork, nowadays they'd call it a nervous breakdown. So you were alone with your mother? I've been holding one hand or another ever since. [father breathing rapidly I've spent my life listening to people that no one else gives a fuck about. You sound angry. I'm not angry, I'm just tired, I just need sleep. I need to go away to Glasgow to see Suzie. She's still under the weather. I'll come with you. Nah, I don't think that's a good idea, she's really not herself. Please. Oh, for fuck's sake, it's not a family outin'. My daughter's ill. She just needs to spend a bit of time with me. I didn't tell you to leave them. [somber piano music] How are you? I'm okay, Dad. I don't want to talk about it. Okay. You seen your granny lately? Last week. Didn't we, Suzie? Tell Dad what happened. Tell me what? Granny showed us a little doll she made. It's got real hair and is dressed like you. She's called it Ronald and sticks pins in it. She says she wants to give you a heart attack. She won't though, will she Dad? No. However hard she tries. [laughing] [Ronnie coughing and groaning] [clock ticking] I'm pleased you haven't brought that slut with you. [Ronnie throat clearing] Susan, elbows please, you're not at your mothers now. Right, which slut would that be, Mother? Don't talk with your mouth full. Don't behave like a savage, use your knife. Suzie tells me that you, um, you made a wee doll. Says you call it Ronald and stick pins in it, trying to give me a heart attack. Susan you're spilling your tea. Tell me about the wee doll. I think it's time to go, come on. [Sydney] I don't quite know how to do it. It's at midnight. [Jim] But that's alright, you know. - It's this way. - Yeah. You see, you know what, you know I think? - Yeah. - Anxiety. That's not good. Nah, anxiety is no good for you. I know, well thank you. No, no, I know what that feels like. Yeah, yeah I'm feeling anxious now, but I just don't know how, how to tell him that this doesn't work. - Well, look. - What would you say? What would you? - Well, you did your best. - I tried. You spent a lot of hours on this. I've spent three hours today doing this. Three hours. No, none of these things fit that. I don't understand them. I used to, but my memory's gone a bit. I thought you could help, I thought you would help, but never mind. The only thing I know how to do is read the front of it, you know. When you think about it, really, you know, when we've got watches and clocks, do you know what the first clock was? - No. - Ever? The Moon, was the first clock. Is that a clock? Yeah, well that's how With the dial on it? Yeah, that's right. Well, no. People used to look up at the moon and they'd say, oh it's night, it's day. That was the first kind of clock. And then we developed these things. So it never had an instrument going round on the moon? - No, no. - It was all in the... No. [Raymond whimpering] What's wrong with you, old sport? You don't have to be afraid. Hey, what's wrong with you? Get away from me. Get away. Silence is golden. Hey what's the matter with you? What's wrong with me? Yeah, let's give him some space. He's got space. Well let's give him some You leave him alone. Let's give him some more, come on. I am the alpha, I am the omega, I'm the beginning and the end. Do you understand what I'm saying? - I understand. - Alright. But come on, let's, let' Unhand me, sir. [upbeat music] *** *** *** *** *** *** *** Jim, let's go have a smoke. Jim. Come on, let's go have a smoke. [Angie] Jim, let go. Let go. - Jim! - Let go! Let her go, let's go have a drink. [dramatic piano music] *** [busy street sounds] [siren wailing] - Thank you very much. - Cheers. [Woman] Thank you so much. - It's all worth it. - Three hours? That's not as far as me. [laughs] Hi. Boo. [crowd laughing] You come again. You're a cult figure here in the USA, Dr. Laing. Are you surprised at your success? Should I be surprised? I'm told that at your Kingsley Hall Mental Institution you advocate treatment for schizophrenics without any kind of medication? Kingsley Hall is not a mental institution. It's a small household of people in different states of mind who are trying to live together in the absence of power relations. So no distinction between doctors and patients? Well there are doctors and there are patients but we're all living together as people. Sometimes doctors need to be helped, and sometimes those that we call patients can offer comfort. And how successful are you? Well there's been no murders. [audience chuckling] You sell thousands of books on student campuses. They call you the Acid Marxist. Well I don't. It's said your books are on every student's bookshelf, somewhere between Castinada and Marx. You're appearing at the same concert as The Grateful Dead. You've even been called the white Martin Luther King. In the 10 seconds we've got left, have you a message for America? Psychiatry is the only branch of medicine that treats people in the absence of symptoms and signs of illness. It's the only branch of medicine that treats people against their will and imprisons them, and the madness of our patients is a result of the destruction wreaked upon them by us, by them and themselves. But madness need not be a breakdown. It could be a breakthrough. Can be potentially liberating. [Man] But people need tranquilizers. Tranquilizers prevent communication. How can you have a dialogue with the mad man if he's dead in the brain? Sarah really hasn't spoken for 18 months. We tried to engage with her. She doesn't eat so we force feed her and of course she's violent. That's why she's here. I'd like to see her. Of course. It would be interesting to hear your assessment. [door banging] Hello. Mind if I sit with you? Do you mind if I, can I? A little cooler. I'm Dr. Laing. You can call me Ronnie. Do you want one? I'll just leave one there, if you, if you... Sorry, do you mind? [Ronnie deeply exhaling] It's quite comforting, isn't it? Yeah. Kind of like that rhythm. Shall we have a wee chat? It's difficult in here, isn't it? Does it give you a headache? [Sarah mumbling] I, a chap I know in London is a, he's a Indian Acupuncturist, you know. And all these points, we have all these points everywhere. There's just, there's two in there, if you can get them, it just, it just.. This would give me a headache in here. Might just help. Do you want, do you mind if I? Do you mind? Just here. Just there. This can be quite nice, you can just, just clears your head a wee bit maybe. Just like that. Just like that. Do you mind if I just? If I can just get right, no? I find it just does, all these points, there's a lot in your feet. Do you mind if I, if I just, just take your, and just... He tells me there's a point in the foot that is related to every other bit of you. Everywhere, if you just find the right... I mean, I'm not an expert. But it used to be quite relaxing. I mean, you're stuck in here all day. How long have you been in here? A long time? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Are you hungry? I'm quite hungry. Should we send out for some pizza? [banging] Hello, could you get us some pizza? Not too much cheese on mine, I don't want to risk a migraine. Sarah will, erm, what do you want? Mushroom? Pepperoni? Pepperoni. Sarah will have pepperoni, thank you. [door banging] [mellow rock music] Thank you. Okay. Thank you. What you did was most unconventional and highly unprofessional. Professor, it's your job to understand what she's trying to say. It's not her job to try and understand why you're filling her full of tranquilizing shit and locking her away. Without this tranquilizing shit, as you call it, most of our patients would get no peace whatsoever from their illness. Is that right? See, I just wonder who's gettin' more peace. Is it them or you? - Sarah's condition-- - I'm not fucking finished. I think you are. [plane humming] [Ronnie] Here you are mate, keep the change. [Driver] Oh cheers, gov, very kind. Did you miss me? What is it? [Paul crying] Paul? It's just too much. You do look awfully tired. Why don't you just, just lie down and have a wee nap. Go on. Yes. That's good, huh? [laughs] And the demon waited at the mouth of the cave for the baby to be born so that he could eat it. You need some fucking help. Mhmm. It'll eat your baby in all. I don't have a baby. [soft piano music] What you lookin' at? Hm. [glass shattering] [thudding] Paul. Paul. Paul. I, erm, I don't think I can stay here much longer. Before I help you with that, if I can help you with that, erm, you have to help me. As far as I can see, in the night you broke that vase. But, I've been asleep. You must have got up for a piss then. Angie loves that vase, she's going to be really upset. I don't... I know how you like Angie. What're we gonna do? [Paul] Well it looks completely fucked. [Ronnie] Aye, it is Paul. We can, erm, try and fix it? Try and fix it, aye. Yeah. [easygoing rock music] [Ronnie inhaling sharply] Yeah. If I put enough glue on it, [laughs]. Yeah, it'll be fine. Everyone wants a piece of you. Don't you get tired of it all? - In there. - In there? Right here? Oh god, it's everywhere. [Ronnie] Ohhh. And what do we think of that? [Ronnie] That is beautiful. [Paul] That is just the ticket. [Ronnie] Very, very lovely. And Humpty's back together again. [laughing] Do you think people might notice? I'll dim the lights. I feel a little better. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you. [crowd chattering] Everyone! [clapping] Would anybody like to sing a song? No? You. You look like you can sing, come on. One song. Okay, I'll do it. [Ronnie] Aww, Angie. [applause] Do you know, After You've Gone? - In C? - Yes please, thank you. Do you know this one? [laughs] [lighthearted piano music] *** * After you've gone, and left me crying * After you've gone, there's no denying * You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad * You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had * There'll come a time * Now don't forget it * There'll come a time * When you'll regret it * Someday when you feel lonely * Your heart will break like mine * And you'll want me only * After you've gone, after you've gone away * [applause] Very lovely. [Angie laughing] I didn't know you could sing. - No, I can't! - You kept that a secret. [laughing] It's a big secret. [soft piano music] [crowd chattering] I hate sharing you. I want you all to myself. You want to own me? No. But I do want more of you. You can have as much as you like, as much as I can give you. Can we talk? Is that not what we're doin'? If I were to have a baby - You're pregnant? - No. But, if I were? Oh Christ, Angie. I already got five children, and don't see much of them. Well that's your choice. It was the mother that I left, not them. But if I were to have a baby, our baby. I can't stop you having a baby. But would you, would you like me to have a baby? Would you like me to like you having a baby? See it's okay for you. You have a family and your, and your work and the famous Dr. Laing. What do I have? A half finished PHD and a tiny bit of you If you want a baby, have a baby. What's wrong with you? You wouldn't have spoken to me like this six months ago. Well you didn't want a baby six months ago. Well I haven't said I want one now. Okay. Okay, let's have a baby. Yeah? [gentle piano music] Hello, Baby. We have to find a way of engaging in a truthful dialogue in a language without knots and entanglements and the wee, the wee barbs of hatred and spite and revenge and jealousy and malice and envy that, that creep into our mouths and hide in our words. Ronnie's working on threesomes right now. [laughing] Yes well, we know how hard it is to keep a marriage alive, don't we? How true that is. Are you speaking from personal experience? Unfortunately yes. Life Is a sexually transmitted disease, [group laughing] and the mortality rate is 100 fucking percent. Listen I'm serious. Bedrooms are the most dangerous places on the earth. What will you call him? I don't know. I was thinking, I was thinking maybe Shadow. Shad-Shadow? Why? Because that's where he'll spend his life, in Ronnie's shadow. If he doesn't burn to cinders first. Don't. Don't. You are not, you are not crazy, like the rest of us. But sometimes I wish I was. [Maria] No. But I'm not. I'm nothing special. I'm just ordinary. Ronnie, he's like this, this hot bright sun, isn't he? He could have any woman he wants. He picked me, and when he focuses his attention on you, you can just, you can just burn up. He makes me feel extraordinary. Well, he used to. The only thing he loves as much as his patients are his children. I thought we could be a family. Maria, what if I've made a terrible mistake? No. Don't be sad. - Okay? - Okay. [somber piano music] I'm hungry. What's for breakfast? This is a nice surprise. John, this might sound like a dumb question but are you actually going to eat that? - Yeah. - Okay, well it's been quite a while since you've had any food and that might be a little bit aggressive. Let me get you something else. Nice to have you with us. [Paul] Porridge. In Scotland, we use salt not sugar. How are you? Okay. [Ronnie] Are you able to tell us what's been going on? I don't think you'd understand. [Ronnie] Maybe I will. Anyway, it doesn't matter now, it's over. [Ronnie] What's over? The mission. [Jim laughs] I had to count to a million, one by one, then back to zero without stopping. [Ronnie] Why? It's the only way to silence the voice. Whose voices? One of my voices. The one that frightened me. John, have you been counting this entire time? Five years. Oh for fuck's sake. Electric shock stopped me. It really hurt my head and I forgot where I was. Sometimes the voices made me deliberately lose track of where I got to. Why didn't you talk to us? The voice wouldn't let me. [Ronnie] It's okay, it's okay. Can I see my parents? Of course you can, yeah, we'll call them. [Jim chanting] [knocking] [Jim chanting softly] What was it you wanted, Jim? And she was delivered of a manchild, and when he came forth from her womb, the dragon was waiting at the mouth of the cave to eat him. You're misquoting Revelations again now Jim. I'm so worried about the birth of this, of this child, Ronnie. I'm tormented by it. Jim, the child is not yet born. Yeah, but when it is born, it won't be me. - Go away! - Alright, just - Get out! - Alright, right, just, alright, just, good. [Angie moaning] Here we go, here we go, here we go. [Angie wailing] Angie, how are you feeling right now? Are you doing okay? - For fuck's sake! - Alright, alright, alright. Give her some space. It's coming. The head's coming. - Visualize, Angie! - Here we go, here we go. [Angie screaming] - Visualize, Angie. - This is my first time, yes. It's coming. [baby crying] It's a boy. - It's a boy? - It's a boy. Shhh. Dr. Laing, Dr. Laing, could you say something for us? Could you say something for us? Not now. [baby crying] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shhh. [low vocalizing] Okay, how do you guys feel right now, can you just, talk to the camera? Anything you want to say? - Not now. - Not now. Okay, let's just, just keep on them. Hello, Gabriel. Hello. Hello! I think we got this. Should we keep rolling, you wanna keep rolling? Are we good? Keep rolling, keep rolling. He's perfect. - You alright? - He is perfect. Guys, sorry, have you got a name for the boy? Fuck off. Alright, keep rolling. [Ronnie] Hello little baby. Raymond, could you, could you just look at the camera? Could we have a quiet word with you? [hissing] [laughing] Can we get any close ups? Can we get close ups? [Jim humming] [Raymond whimpering] Come on Barabus, open up. Open up. There. There you go. Now. Can't believe it, forgot the hammer. [Raymond whimpering] Did you know he stole and ate the placenta? Yeah, anything goes, but we have a duty to protect Well who protects Jim? He came here for sanctuary. Ronnie, he might kill someone. Do you really wanna take that risk? Why didn't you tell me about Jim? Well I didn't care when he threatened to hurt me, but he's talking about stealing Gabe. I had to tell someone. Why didn't you tell me? I'm telling you now. So what are you gonna do about it? I'm dealing with it. I failed him. You failed him? Ronnie, he's threatened to kill me. You know I'd never let that happen. There's someone with him, all the time, round the clock. He's still here? I can't just throw him out. If I did that every time someone had a problem there'd be nobody here. I will live anywhere you want, you know that, but you have to tell me that we are going to be safe. The call men, Angie. Save one soul save the world. Well let that one soul be our baby. He didn't choose to live in this fucking mad house. But do we actually know how Electro convulsive Therapy works? No. Of course we don't know precisely how ECT works, we never claimed we do. We simply know it does work. What he fails to mention is that after receiving ECT some people lose their memory, not to mention their personality. Dr. Laing must agree that this procedure is the most effective treatment for severe depression. No, I don't agree with anything you say. After less than five minutes from first laying eyes on a stranger, and without this stranger even having moved or uttered a word, he can have them taken away, drugged, electrocuted, or have bits of their brain removed. That's not entirely true. You know, the Nazis executed 50,000 psychiatric patients to prevent them from breeding. That's hardly relevant. Well it was fucking relevant to them. Dr. Laing, language please. Dr. Meredith, I can only apologize. I've heard far worse. [mellow rock music] [banging] - Hello. - Dr. Laing. How is she? The test results have confirmed her initial diagnosis. I'm sorry. What we can offer now is palliative care. How long? It's impossible to say. Every case is different. Oh come on, spare me. What are we talking? Days, weeks, months, years? Weeks. She knows she's very ill so there's no point in telling her anymore than is absolutely necessary. Well don't you think she's got the right to know that she's not gonna wake up one day soon? Her mother doesn't want her told. Right. Alright, thanks. Hello! Hi, Dad. [Ronnie] How you feeling? Tired. Dad, I want the truth. We've always known that there was no cure. So I'm going to die? Yeah. When? Soon. Dad, I'm scared. Shhhh, it's okay. Shhh. Can I ask you something? Anything. Do you believe in life after death? Whoa. [blowing through lips] That's a big question, that is. That's a belief in God. I was going to ask that too. Ahh. Wow. Well we could sit here all day debating questions like that. I've got time. Well, the Buddha was asked about the creation of the world and he said that he only ever tried to answer questions that could potentially be answered. Go about. [both laugh] For what it's worth, yeah, I think there's more to life than being trapped in a body. It's alright. [Suzie crying] Shhh. I helped you into this world, I'll help you leave it. [melancholy piano music] It's okay. I'm here. [train rumbling] * Wherever we may turn * This lesson we must learn * A boy's best friend is his mother Ronnie stop it, we're trying to get to sleep, please. I'm singing him a wee song so he knows about his mother's sweet and gentle love. You've just come back, you haven't even said hello to us. * So cherish her with care * And smooth her silvery hair * When gone you will never get an I said stop it, I mean it. But I like that song. Talk to me, please. About what? Anything, just, just talk to me. You have time for everybody but us. We live here in this mad house, just to be with you. Give the fucking martyrdom a rest. [piano pounding] I deal in human fucking misery every day. Up to my neck in people's emotional shit. Who takes care of me? [Ronnie laughs] I'm supposed to heal. I can't do that if I can't even help myself. You have to stop drinking, okay? Okay? Timothy Leary said that he would, ah, he would distribute 300,000 trips of acid for free. He was telling me, he says, "Ronnie, Britain's your patch." He wanted me to do it! [crowd laughing] I said, fuck you. Imagine getting fucked by somebody else's fantasy. [crowd laughing] [crowd chattering] [crowd cheering] Alright. Let's see who's the stronger! [crowd shouting] Come on, Ronnie. That's it. Take him out. [crowd chattering] [crowd cheering] [Man] Come on, come on, get off! I suppose I just feel taken for granted. Everyone else's problems seem so, so fucking important. There never seems to be any time for mine. I will always find time to listen to you. Am I interrupting? No we were, we I was talking to her. Please, Ronnie. What's your game? What game would that be? You're drunk. And you're a fucking slut, but in the morning I'll be sober. I doubt that. [Crowd] Ooh! [crowd shouting] [women shrieking] [gentle piano music] You disgust me. You fucking disgust me! And your fucking disgusts me. Paul is our friend. He was trying to be nice to me. I can't do this anymore. What has happened to you, Ronnie? I don't even recognize you anymore. Do you have any respect for me? You think I'm sleeping with everyone? No, no, no. Just the odd one or two. I'm not! You're becoming as deluded and paranoid as the rest of them. What the fuck do you know about delusion and paranoia? You live a charmed life. All I've got is misery. You know fuck all about misery either. You should hear the things I hear. You've no idea what some of those poor bastards go through everyday. Oh yes, and only the great Dr. Laing can help them. Every other single psychiatrist in the entire world is wrong. Only Dr. Laing can cure them in his famous fucking mad house. You love all this! Angie, you're all I've got. If I lose you, I got, I've got nothing. I can't feel your love. I can't feel yours. [crowd shouting] [baby crying] [glass shattering] [rock thudding] [patients whimpering] You alright? Fuckers! Don't worry everyone, keep calm. I'm going to sort this out. You small minded fucking hypocritical bastards. Come on then, come on then! Take all this! [crowd shouting] - You know everybody, of course? - Yes. Hello John. - Gentlemen. - Gentlemen. Right. Now, Dr. Laing has taken over the care of a former patient of mine, an extremely vulnerable young man. He was responding well to chlorpromazine and ECT. Laing has since withdrawn all treatment. So what is he doing? Well Dr. Laing is a great advocate of allowing nature to take its course. Meaning? He, he lets people go mad, believing eventually they will heal themselves, or God will. And your patient? I wasn't allowed to see him. Laing said he wanted to be alone and that they respected his wishes. And this boy is being allowed to starve himself to death, locked in a room without vital medication. And remind us what the police found. A small amount of LSD, on license. I suggest we make a formal inspection, then move for a recommendation for closure. [Ronnie wailing] [somber piano music] [Paul] I'm so sorry Ronnie. What's happened? Ronnie? Ronnie, what's wrong? - What's wrong? - Suzie died. [Ronnie sobbing.] It's okay, it's okay. [patients shrieking] And she shall burn, and the kings of the earth who have fornicated deliciously with her shall weep and lament at the smoke of her burning. Where's that bastard you've spawned? Go on. Jim. Jim. Jim! Satan who was cast out of heaven, and all his angels - Get out! Go on! - And all his angels delivereth from the world - Enough! - No. [Jim groaning] [Paul] Ronnie, Ronnie! They shall know who you are, they will cast you out, cast him out. What you think about me? I know what's happening. What's that whore of Babylon been saying to you? - Right. - No! [men grunting] Mind his head. - You're in a lot of pain. - I'm not in pain. You're either gonna hurt yourself or someone else. I can help you. - I'll be good! - I'm not gonna hurt you. - You have to trust me. - I'll be good! No, no! You said no drugs! Ahhh! Ahh! [Jim groaning] You're a traitor. You're a fucking hypocrite. [baby cooing] Jim's been sectioned. Well done. What the fuck do you want? You don't want him here, you don't want him hospitalized. You don't want him to hurt people, you don't want him tranquilized. I did not want him sectioned. What did you think would happen when we turned our back? Well guess what, they've come for John too. [ominous music] [all speaking simultaneously] We're obliged for his own safety to section John Holding. Are you kidding me? For his own safety? What's wrong with him? [John shouting] [Man] John! [patient crying] [upbeat music] There's Daddy. Alright, I won't be a minute. You alright, Jim? Still snowing. Don't have to go to school today. No. Remember when we made the snowman last year and the rain just washed it away? Do you remember that, Dad? Aye. Yeah. Do you want to go on a wee adventure? Come on. [door creaking] For fuck's sake. Excuse me sir, can you drive on? We'll go up to the main road and phone. Give me him, it'll be quicker. [Ronnie grunting] ["Moondance" by Van Morrison] *** * Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance * With the stars up above in your eyes * A fantabulous night to make romance * 'Neath the cover of October skies [Ronnie] We're just at the top of hill on the bend of the road by the hospital. * To the sound of the breezes that blow * Yeah and I'm trying to please to the calling * Of your heartstrings that play soft and low *** John's very fortunate to have your support.
