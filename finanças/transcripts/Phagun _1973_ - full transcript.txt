Mother! Father! Father! What happened? - What happened, Shanta? He didn't come. It's one 0' clock. I knew it. One day he'll go and never return. The people of Japan, Africa, Nepal, Bhutan keep guests at home. That too for months. For years! But they never keep their son-in-law! Shanta! Yes! Just because he was an ordinary writer. He didn't used to do the illegal and smuggling business. He could not have earned a lot of money. That's why neither you allowed me to go with him. Nor you let him stay in the house. He used to enter his own house like a thief. What happened? Oh God! You? What's the matter? Huh! Oh shucks! This is too much! What a nuisance! Come on, dear. Why do you come late; dear Gopal? You know that impatient girl. Shanta, go. The food is ready. Go and feed him. Where were you? Where were you? Where were you? I was at the distant of one hand from you, Shanta. You didn't spread your arms. Yes! My name is Shanta. I am so impatient from within. Actually I had gone to one publisher. Whatever it is! You return home as soon as it is evening! When it is night; then I don't know what happens to me! All right! All right, darling! I will not be late from tomorrow. Come. Psst! Psst! It's true! When men go out then sometimes they get late. Now will you stop blabbering or not? This girl has ruined her life. Along with her she has ruined our lives too! Now did you see? He'll write for the entire night. And he'll keep the lights on for the entire night. This Shekhar Gopal! You read me and write me. Am I less than any book? You are a lot more beautiful than it, my darling! I ask you; till when will you keep awake at nights? Even you keep me awake. Don't you? Shucks! Don't you have any shame? I will keep awake till that time, Shanta. Till I don't earn enough money. Till I don't purchase a house. And until I don't take you from here. Your father.. - Let your father say anything. Neither I will stay here nor let you stay here. Listen, you don't earn a lot of money. Why? Why shouldn't I earn? No female wants that her husband should be very rich. Why, darling? You don't understand. Then he doesn't belong to her anymore. But your father and your mother. Oh yes, yes! You have seen mother, haven't you? She is living. Yes? You don't worry, my Shanta. A writer never has the danger to earn more money. Did you understand? Aren't we less in number today? Oh yes, pal! This is the problem with the oldies. Today someone is present; tomorrow he is no more! Oh, yes! Go! Your controlling power if very weak! Pal Rajjab Ali! - Yes? I have heard you have married some unmarried girl. At your native place. - Yes! Hey, neither you have intestines nor teeth, scoundrel! Hey but, doctor Effendi. After all what one has to do with teeth in a marriage. You find some medicine, Rajjab Ali. If not lying down; then at least you'll be able to sit. Wow. Come on; brothers. Now even the roads are tired! Come on! Come on! - Let's go! You wretched fellow! So you are spying? My eyesight is weak. That's why I am spying. Here, even you spy a little! - Give me! Hey, just look! Just look! Our Indian brothers are too much! Where-where they grasp an opportunity! They all are our guests. The husband is Indian and the wife is Japanese. - Yes. I think he is romancing with her! Damle, I heard there is some guests have arrived at your place! Mr. Nasir, all these are businessmen. Oh! Those ones! Those ones! The dumb ones with crooked faces! Yesterday night my daughter did a drama in front of them. Come there. Day by day you are making your daughter a neurotic. Towards her husband; because of your attitude. That poor one is always fearful and insecure regarding him. Mr. Nasir, first that girl married against my wishes. - I see! At least she should have found a man.. ...Equal to me and my position. That pauper; worthless writer! What does one gets by writing down on paper? I tried to involve him in my business. You know; what he said? The man who does the adulteration of grains. He is not ready to work with him. In fact this is a proof of his honesty and high status! High status mam? My foot! He has written an article about the entire business community. Whoever reads it; he'll recognise that I am its villain. By just looking at him my anger is aroused! That scoundrel! He back bites the person who feeds him! I know him very well, Damle. He is a very self respected and a sincere boy. Forget the food of your house. He is not even ready to drink the water. He comes to your house only for this reason. Because he is madly in love with Shanta. Listen to one thing carefully. These writers and artists are very sensitive! The day their self respect is hurt. Hey, what story have you two started telling? Come on! Listen brother! - Yes? Some people are arriving for dinner at my place tonight. Oh! Those with the crooked faces? Shamrao, today is Tuesday, isn't it? Yes brother, today is Tuesday. Oh! But why does it seem old? All right! Wednesday is pure! Yes! That is true! Are you a psychiatrist? What is she speaking? She says are you mental doctor? No madam, for you kind information. I am not a mad doctor. In fact I am a doctor of the mad ones. Hey listen, pal Effendi. - Yes? When some man comes to you. - Yes, yes. How do you come to know he is mad? Firstly when he talks like you. After that by looking at him. Come pal Effendi, I'll introduce you to some people. Oh yes, I am coming. Greetings, brother doctor. Oh yes! Greetings, sister-in-law. Sister-in-law, today you are looking very beautiful! He is Mr. Marker, the king of the race course. He is doctor Effendi. Oh, oh! I understood! I understood! The people start the food course and he starts the race course. I regularly do the race course, doctor Effendi. But this wretched Shamrao! He makes money directly. He is Seth Chunibhai. Overseas film distributor. He is doctor Effendi. How are you, Mr. Chunibhai? I am fine! I am fine! Chunibhai, you might never have purchased any films. Then how do the films reach to America in the vegetable basket? Effendi! - Yes? Pal, this man's eyes are not in focus. He'll look that way. You'll think he is looking towards you. Which man? He? - Yes. He is Prince Rustogia, the banker. Doctor Effendi. Greetings! How are you? Whom are you asking? I am addressing you. What are you with me? - Addressing! Addressing! Oh, oh! So you are addressing me and I am addressing you. That's it! The food is laid out, sir. Oh! Thank God! Thank God! Please come. Come. Oh wow! Fantastic! Dear, you were telling that the skirt top won't suit you. Yes? Hey uncle, I forgot to thank you. It's very beautiful! It's very beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. - Come now. Please come, dear. Sit here. Come! Come! Oh yes! Sit down, sister-in-law! Ahaa! Start eating, brothers. But some people have still not arrived. I know! But what will he do coming to this party? Let's start! Greetings, sir! Hey shoo! Shoo off! I am sorry. - I thought the party must be over. I was waiting for you only, Gopu. By the way, Mr. Damle, who is this gentleman? You eat food. There is no vacant chair. You please sit here. Sit down, Viju. You sit, I.. I will change clothes and come. I am not enjoying today, Shamrao. Why, what happened? I don't like it. Uncle...? - You eat food, dear. I can't bear to see this. Brother. . - No, sister-in-law. Hey, you all eat, brothers. Gopu! Shanta, I am here! Forgive me! Please forgive me. Daily he criticizes you. And he humiliates you. Hey, that man is humiliated, darling. The one who has any respect! Shucks! If you'll say this thing again then I.. What will you do? I..I.. As if you will not need me again! Shanta, you love me very much, don't you? Move aside! You have made me unhappy. Is my love such; that you have a need to ask? There is no need, Shanta. But I don't know why I feel like asking you again and again! I walk with you love like this, Gopu! As one walks in a storm with a lamp in hand. Why? Do you fear anything? Yes, I fear that what if you leave me and go away? All my family members.. - I am not bothered about your family members. Yes but if you say anything wrong some day.. No darling! Do you see this? I know! You writers and artists are very sensitive! Yes darling! Will there be any shortage of saris with sister-in-law? Mr. Hitashi, Shanta has thousands of saris. But she'll become so happy by getting one sari of my earnings. You can never guess this! The matter is such, that I strictly don't prefer giving an advance. At the end of the year I pay the entire accounts. I am not talking about the accounts but feelings! So we'll do one thing. By which we both will be satisfied. You consider this as the advance. And I'll consider this as a debt. How will I buy a good sari in 100 rupees? Then give it back. I mean you take it afterwards. Yes? What do you want? Do you have Mr. Gopal's novel, 'Agla Kadam'? Yes, of course. - Please give me. Laxmi, bring Mr. Gopal's novel, 'Agla Kadam.' Just see the copy will be in front on the third shelf. After all what price sari do you want? Err.. around 100 or 125 rupees. There is no question of Banarasi sari at this low price range. Yes! This costs 86 rupees fifty paisa! This is very inferior. This.. how much is this for? This costs 166 rupees. - No. Listen. You.. are Shamrao Damle's son-in-law? - Yes. Then why are you talking about money? The money will be taken later. No! Listen! Please listen! Please listen.. It's Holi today! Hey, colour him! Happy Holi! - Same to you! Come on Shanta, let's play Holi. No, no. He is going to come. I'll go and change my sari. Then we'll play. Okay? Come, Shanta. Hey listen; it's such an expensive sari. She'll change it first and then play. Okay? We will not put colours on her. Please come. Hey but.. "O' play Holi with your beloved." "Play Holi with your beloved." "Play Holi with your beloved." "Phagun has arrived." "O' Phagun has arrived!" "Drench your drape, O fair lass." "Phagun has arrived." "O' Phagun has arrived." "Dhin-Na-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Ta-ta-ta ! " "Dhin-Na-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Wherever you see!" "There is a commotion!" "The glosses fly in the lane." "And the colours in the sky." "Somewhere someone, Oh my, my!" "Stares lovingly at the body!" "The story of love moves ahead." "And the cheeks are blush!" "Someone teases the beloved." "Someone teases the beloved." "Phagun has arrived." "O' Phagun has arrived!" "Dhin-Na-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Dhin-din-tinak-dhin." "Ta-ta-ta ! " "Someone says, O lover girl, listen to the call." "Your beloved has arrived after many years." "Today you definitely embrace me." "With the excuse of Holi; meet once." "There are colours on my body." "There are colours on my heart." "Some beloved had put colours!" "Across the garden." "O' fair lass your beloved awaits you." "With love in eyes and glow on the face." My sari was so expensive! What right you have to spoil that thing? Which you can't buy and give me yourself? You are telling the right thing, Shanta. The thing which I can't buy for you. I had no right to spoil it also. I didn't have any right. I didn't have any right. Goodness me! Was this a less punishment? You had reduced me to a living dead body! Now you have converted my daughter to the same! Oh God! Harsuiya! Harsuiya is no more! Hey, how many children do we have? After all everything belongs to her. Will we take all this with us when we die? I say.. - Silent! You didn't allowed sister-in-law to live peacefully all her life. Now you are stopping her from weeping also? You shut up! This is my family matter. Shamrao! I am sorry, Effendi. Come inside the room. Greetings! - Greetings! Have a seat. Come, Jagyani Seth! - Greetings, brother. Sit down! Sit down! - How did you come? Your son-in-law had come to purchase sari for your daughter. He had less money so he returned back. I went on telling him to take it. The money will be taken later. Gopu! Hey? What's this? - Hey, pick her up, make her sit on the chair. But what has happened to her? - Control her! Come, dear. Oh yes, yes! Lie down on this chair. Hey, bring a glass of water. Bring a glass of water. Dear! My daughter is my lifetime savings. What happened, brother doctor? Sister-in-law! - Yes? Oh! Mother? Greetings, sir. Greetings, sir. Hey? You shouldn't run like this at such time, dear. Mother, did you come to know anything? Father! Uncle! Did you come to know anything? Uncle! We are telling you, dear. We are telling you. Father! Mother! Please tell me. Uncle! Speak! At least speak something. What should I tell you, dear? We searched a lot. But we didn't come to know anything. I say, that rogue didn't loved Shanta at all! Only because of my wealth.. Father! - I am telling the right thing. This is a simple of desertion! Doctor, let the time pass. I will take divorce from the court. And get Shanta remarried again. Mother! This baby girl is born in the seventh month. We have kept her in the incubator. The chances of her survival are fifty-fifty. Doctor! Sister-in-law! "O my beloved, he has become heartless." "Someone go and make him up." "O my beloved!" "He didn't know my value." "O' he didn't know my value." "He forgot me." "My beloved! He became heartless!" "Someone go and make him up." "O my beloved!" "I fell in love with an uncompassionate man." "Without him I have gone crazy." "He didn't know my value." "He forgot me." "O my beloved." "Beloved, you don't know, how.." "..alone I am without you.." Dear, from today I am your father. You don't worry. You are not alone. I promise you. That I'll find out your husband. Santosh, don't harass me. Mangla, take her away from here. No, no, no! I'll stay here only. - Dear, come here. Okay, okay. Let her be here. Again the same thing. It's tickling me. What are you doing? Mummy, shall I light a cracker? Yes, yes, but on the terrace. Santosh! My butter toast! Baby has become four years old. - Yes. And now she'll become young within some time. - Yes. Then you'll have to get her married. And she'll go away with her husband. Leaving this house? What are you blabbering standing here? Don't you have any work at home? Go away from here. Don't grow big so soon! Mangla, prepare the tea. Santosh is going to arrive from college. Hi Santosh! Listen! Hi! Why are you going to college so late? My class was late today. And listen, Yasmin was calling you. She is at the hospital. I will meet her. Okay! Bye-bye! - Bye. Hi Santosh! Yeah! Sheena was telling you had called me. Yes, I remembered you. Sit. What's the matter? I want that today you accompany me. - Where? At the club! Hey pal, what hunks come there! There is a lot of music and dance there. And then slowly the lights go off! No, no, I can't go there. You killjoy! You always blabber such things! Hey, I am not a free girl like you. Mother waits for me every moment. I can't even sit here for more time. Hey, you have grown up now. Till when you will bother about your mother. Just breathe in the fresh air of outside. I didn't mean to say this, silly. I mean to say. Shucks! Shameless girl! It's great fun! No pal, I am afraid. Hey, these men are brave till the time we are cowards! You start teasing them first. Then just see how they perspire with fright! But won't you go to hospital today? Hospital? Forget it! Huh! Today I have a new duty today! Miss Shameful, I'll leave now. BYE-bye! " BYE-bye! So my darling daughter has arrived! - Oh yes! Mama! - Yes? Father was very handsome, wasn't he? - Yes. And you were impressed by him! What a personality, mother! So big eyes. Mother, when father used to smile. Hey, what should I tell you? The entire world used to brighten up! Mother! Father? Come on run from here! Come on, run. Go now. You sat here again? I have refused you several times. Don't sit on this chair and table. If you want to study then go down and study. Mummy ! - Yes I don't know what the matter is. But the people see me. What do they see? - I don't know. When I go there then they see from here. And if I go here then they see from there. Someone whistles at me and someone.. - Huh? Listen, you go directly to the college from home. And come to home directly from college. If anyone whistles at you or makes passes on the way. Then you tell him clearly. Don't you have mother or sister at home? Okay? - Yes. What are you staring at? Don't you have mother or sister at home? No! No? Then what? 'Mummy didn't tell me anything else.' Oh God! How are you, sweetheart? Yasmin! I am going to watch a movie. - Will you come? No! I'll miss my college. Let it be missed! - Oh shut up! Sit down! Let's go! Come on; let's go immediately. Shut the door properly. You stay behind, minor girl! This is an adult film. No one will give you a ticket. Two balcony tickets! Thank you! You? You can't go inside. This is an adult film. What do you think? - I am the mother of a child. Pal, how do you come to know that the girl is adult? What should I tell you, pal? I myself is an outsider. "O' about the water of the rains." "I will tell you; I'll talk something to you." "A light one! A light one! A light one!" "The foggy-foggy night; as if it is the meeting bed." "The foggy-foggy night; as if it is the meeting bed." "As if some moon rising and hiding behind the clouds." Oh wow! Today I enjoyed a lot! It was real fun! Yes! And I missed my college. If mother comes to know. Then I'll get so severe scolding! Don't ask! What is this? Yes? Hey, that only! Whatever that happens in this world! What happens in the world? Hey pal, you are totally dumb! Read this book; you'll get some senses! They are the practical things! But listen, this book shouldn't go in your mother's hands. All right. This boy? Hey, the same one whom we met in the morning. Till today no girl had the guts to refuse him. But this scoundrel! He doesn't give a pass to any girl. He does such a thing. As if he is not a boy but a father. If he were your father then.. Oh God! I totally forgot. Today there is an operation at the hospital. Come on; drop me there while going. Please come now. No!!! What's wrong with you? What happened? What happened? Yes? He.. whose father was he? Father? - Yes. You are a very manner less and misbehaved girl. Why did you allowed her to come inside? I.. what did I know? Don't you know some people can't see blood? Yes? Now how are you, Miss.. - Santosh! Yes, Miss Santosh! Yes? I hate you. I hate you. Hey? This is too much! She lives in my area. She studies in I.V. College. But why was she uttering the father's name? She doesn't have a father, doctor. I mean she had; but she doesn't have now. Mama! - So you have arrived, dear! Mangla! Yes! Coming! Mummy, there is one boy whom I hate a lot. Why? What did he do? He didn't do anything. - Then? Just like that! Listen girl, neither you have to hate anyone or love! Don't dare to think anything except your studies. Or think of anything else! - Understood? Now go inside. Freshen up and change your clothes. Go now. I am leaving. Now it's her age, madam. Yes! If you won't search a boy for her. Then she'll find one herself. No! Don't talk such things, Mangla! 'Please come now.' 'I can't manage alone anymore.' Huh? Aaah! Suman! Move aside! Suman! I love you, Suman! Don't blabber! What is love; what does a girl like you know? You are not a girl. You are a dead body. A dead body! The one whom anyone can take and anywhere. Oh darling! In spite of being a modern man of today. You are talking such things. What's the matter of today and future in this? A man always likes that girl who has saved herself for him. Understood? - Oh, come on, Suman! You be a boy only. Don't try to become my father. Yes! Father is not a worthless thing. The girl who had not got the love of a father. She keeps on wandering aimlessly. Just like you! - Suman! Mean, rascally fellow! Who? A rogue! Hey, this wretched doctor! No decent girl can marry him. Yes? No decent girl can marry him. Yasmin! - Huh? I'll be right back. Hello! Oh! Hello! Is that man saved? - Who? That one.. the man that day. You.. you know.. Yes! He'll recover in some days and go away. Did his daughter and wife come to meet him? Daughter? - Yes. - He doesn't have a daughter. Yes, he has one son. And his wife left him years before. Oh God! What's happening in this world? If I'll love someone; then I'll never desert him. You mean after marriage? By the way, you are a good man, doctor. But remember this. No decent girl will marry you. Hey? Listen! Santosh! Santosh! Hey, at least listen to me. Where have you brought me? I myself don't know. I went on steering and the car went on! Actually I had come to warn you regarding Yasmin. Yes. She is a student doctor for name sake. But she is not interested in becoming a doctor. At least she is interested in a doctor! What are you blabbering? She is an outline and a flirt girl. She wanders in the entire city. Don't you dare to meet her! What do you mean? Who are you to order me? I? If I were something of yours. Then had I just talked with you. Then what you would have done? I would have caught your plait and given you a tight slap! Ouch!!! On the way you are going. Just look! Do you want to die? Yes? Whether I live or die; why are you concerned? Yes? Every boy wants that the girl should fell down. And he should save her. Mamma. I have heard your father has gone somewhere. Yes! There is no news about him from 17 to 18 years. But mummy still waits for his return. She thinks he'll definitely return some day. My mother is not only a Goddess, Suman! She is my mother! You are very foolish! You? Who told you? What? What he told me? This only. A foolish girl! Foolish girl? Yes! When father used to adore mummy a lot. Then he used to call mummy as a foolish girl! Oh! Err.. not a sweeper but a washer woman. N'), a sweeper! A washer woman! Sweeper! Washer woman! Oh, oh! He used to call her a sweeper. He must be calling her a washer woman. I hate you! Really? Hate me a little more. Hate me a little more. A little more! A little more! Hey? Even my father had so broad shoulders. Really? - Yes. And so large eyes! I swear! - Really? By the way, I will never marry. And if I'll marry then only that man. The one who keeps mummy with him. Then it's fine! If not a father, then I'll get a mother. What do you mean? Your parents? I don't have them. - I am an orphan. It's such a good thing! It's a very sad thing. Doesn't matter! I am a half orphan and you are a full orphan. How much are we both together? One and a half orphan! Come on! Listen! Listen! Whenever you meet mummy. Then you tell her that I study a lot. Yes, that is true! Come on. Scholar! Go! Go now! Mother! Mother! Go! Go! Toshi! He is that boy, isn't he? About whom you were telling me. Yes! Call him inside. - But, mother. I am telling you. Go and call him. Mummy! Come, mummy is calling you. Mummy!? Hey, I was giving you so many hints from when. And you were stuck in your first gear! What should I do? In love. Only the first gear works! Come on; mummy seems to agree. Hey, mummy seems to agree? I'll hit you! Shameless fellow! Santosh, will your mummy hit me? So what happened! Get thrashed up! - Huh? - Can't you do this much for me? No! I can never be thrashed up. - That too for others! Please do this much for my sake! All right! I understood! Please come. Give me your hand.- Here. Greetings, mother. Live long, dear. Have a seat. Are you still studying? Didn't Santosh tell you? I have passed my MBBS two years back. I am a house surgeon at the hospital. And my salary is.. - You don't worry about that. Your parents? They are no more. I have studied by giving tuitions. If I get you both married. Then will you live here? I have such a big house. And I am alone here. Mother.. From the time he left; he didn't return back. There will be a male in the house. You stay with us. Err.. I don't know where I will get the job. It's one and the same thing. Whether I stay with you or you stay at my place. Please wait! What is this, mother? This is your auspicious gift. I'll start preparing for your marriage from now. You don't worry about the clothes. I'll do all that. You just give your measurement. Mother! - Live long! Yes, yes! Go dear! Go and leave him. Go! Thank you, mother. Listen! Listen! Whatever mother has given you. Give back to me. - Why? Now listen, I am your future wife. Really? So whatever you'll earn; you'll give it to me. And I'll return it to you one by one. This will not happen. Why it won't happen? My Wish! - Hey? "When do they agree?" "The crazy lovers!" "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." "Even though God comes to make them up!" "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." "O' I have given you my heart and my consent." "O' in spite of losing my heart; I have given you love." "O' I have given you my heart and my consent." "O' in spite of losing my heart; I have given you love." "So we are crazy about each other." "Then why should anyone come to teach us?" "We live lost in each other." "Wherever we go!" "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." "Even though God comes to make them up!" "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." "O' your open hair makes me desperate." "Your lashes arouse the feelings of my heart." "O' your open hair makes me desperate." "Your lashes arouse the feelings of my heart." "Your loving gestures impress me." "Your love has brought such a colourful effect." "Just look I am feeling so elated." "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." "Even though God comes to make them up!" "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." "O' when do they agree; the crazy lovers." Gardener! One week has passed since we arrived here. But it seems we have arrived here yesterday. Hey! I feel like eating with these hands so much. You spare time sometime. Let my posting be done. Then I have a lot of free time. I think; far from Mumbai. I should work at some such hospital. Where everything is.. Why far off? Are you telling because of mummy? Mummy? What are you saying? You bring mummy in every thing. Just like that! Hey just listen.. 'Where has she gone?' Santosh! Hey butter toast! What happened? Do you think I said anything regarding your mummy? Yes? You are feeling all right, aren't you? What's this? Oh! I have understood. You have recollected you childhood boyfriend. Yes? Tell me the truth. - What's the matter? Yes? When I can feed morsels to you. Do you get that in your hands by putting in my mouth? We are married yesterday. And today the situation is this! You got angry over such a small thing? It must be a small thing for you. And then from the time we came here. You didn't call me a sweeper even once. Yes sweeper! I have definitely committed this mistake. Please forgive me. Hey! Shall I ask you one thing? - Ask. You will not leave me and go away. Toshi! You are a real darling! I will.. - Hey! Ouch! What happened? Mother! "When the evening arrives." "My heart becomes sad." "Where should I go?" "What should I do?" "When the evening arrives." "My heart becomes sad." "Where should I go?" "What should I do?" "When the evening arrives." "Who is my dear one?" "Whom should I call?" "I am sitting alone." "I look at the birds." "I look at the birds." "Even the birds go away." "Everyone returned back." "Only you didn't return back." "What should I do?" "When the evening arrives." "My every night; it is the night of isolation." "It is a lonely night." "What is the heart; they don't know this." "These two eyes of mine." "These two eyes of mine." "One night passes and other night arrives." "You only tell me." "What should I do?" "When the evening arrives." "My heart becomes sad." "Where should I go?" "What should I do?" "When the evening arrives." Ahaa! No one is happier than us in this world. - Oh! Greetings, mother. Live long! How are you, Jiyaram? Suman! Mummy! Oh mummy! Why didn't you tell before? Greetings, mother. Forgive me, dear. I.. it's such a big house. I was not able to live there alone. You don't worry. I will serve you. I.. I will not come your way. Mummy won't come in our way. What are you talking, mother? Such a big bungalow.. Yes, such a big bungalow and no place for you? You were alone there. - Its better you came here. She did the right thing, didn't she? Yes! She has done the right thing. Come on! Jiyaram, bring the luggage. Hurry UP! 'Move aside from here.' - 'What are you doing?' 'Oh, oh! - All right. That's it!' 'Is it done this way? - Fine? Happy?' 'Happy? I'll give you a tight slap.' - 'Don't you feel ashamed?' 'Behave yourself.' 'Let me do it.' Santosh! 'Hey, no. It's okay. Okay! Your turn.' 'Do whatever you want.' 'Okay? - Yes.' 'Come here.' "O my beloved, he has become heartless." "Someone go and make him up." "O my beloved" Jiyaram, your sir is going to wake up now. Go and warm up water for his bath. All right. Take this. - You give this to me. Keep this over there. Get up, I am feeling very hungry. Get up! Hey, get up, I am feeling very hungry. I am feeling sleepy. Toshi! Oh! My hands are paining. No! Hey go It's mummy! Greetings, dear. - Greetings, mother. You were telling you were feeling hungry. Take this. You.. why did you take the trouble? Yes, mummy. Why do you work so much? What are you telling, dear? Do I have anyone else in this world? For whom I can do something. Yes? Eat it. Hey? The fork and knife? Jiyaram! Jiyaram! How did mother come to know that I am feeling hungry? This means she roams nearby only. Yes? We don't even have our bedroom privacy? Don't blame mother. Mother is a very loving lady. She may be a sea of love. But I think I won't be able to bear this love. Santosh, I don't why but I fear a big danger. You are just like this! Toshi, why don't you understand? I don't mother's love but your love! You cook and feed me. You wash and iron my clothes. You go for an outing with me. You.. - Okay darling, fine! Now eat this. Hey sweeper! - What is it? There is no button on my shirt. I'll stitch it just now. Give me. I will sew the button, dear. You get ready. Mummy! Take it, dear. - Hey? You are in such a hurry? Toshi! Mummy, you don't know what you are doing? But what am I doing? You are making your daughter's life miserable. He had told me to sew the button. So what happened if I sewed it? Oh, oh! Now how should I tell you? Your parents had ruined your life with their motherhood. You are ruining your daughter's life with your motherhood! Oh God! I thought that how much sorrow my father gave him. I will give your husband that much happiness! And I should show the world! Mother! Please forgive me. - Santosh! Go! He is calling you. Let him call me. Until you won't forgive me. - I will not go! Toshi! Go now. Go he is calling you. - I beg in front of you. I plead in front of you. Go now. What happened? You don't know anything about emotions. You may be a doctor of body. But not of the heart. What is someone's feeling? How do anyone feels? You will never understand this. Santosh, don't you dare! Does anyone talks like this with her husband? Did I teach you this and sent you? Now if you speak one more word. Then I'll pull off your tongue! Toshi is at no fault in this, mother. Then entire fault is mine! No dear, she is the root cause. Oh, oh! Now even you are getting angry. Oh yes, I just remembered! Today there is a very good programme at the theater. Even you will have to accompany us. No dear, I will not come. You will not come? If you will not come then even I will not go. I am sitting here. Neither I'll go anywhere nor eat anything. Mother, he is requesting you so lovingly. No dear, don't kill me like this. You just let me live. You be in front of my eyes. I don't want anything else. Mother! I don't want anything. Mother! Huh? What are you doing? What? Hush! Yes. Your.. What nonsense? Why did you give it to her when I have the token? Didn't she come with you? I thought that. . Why did you understand this? Without the token how can you give the thing? Sir, that is fine. - It is wrong. It's wrong! Wrong! Wrong on principles. Suman! - Let it be, dear. I am sorry, sir. What the hell do you mean by sorry? I'll see that you are fired this very moment! Where is the secretary of this place? Where is the secretary? I say come. It's hell! Hell, hell, hell out of it! At least you should have thought about us. You were not ready to understand anything. This is the limit! I am talking about some principle! Let it be, dear. Even I am talking about one principle.. - Toshi! I can't bear someone's interference in everything. And I will not bear considering every good thing as wrong. Between us; forget human beings. I will not even allow God to come between us. Oh, oh! Is there any God greater than a human? There is! Your mother! She is not your mother but a rival lady! - Shut up! Don't dare to say anything to my mother. I will say. I will say several times. I had told you before marriage. That mother will live with us. I understood as soon as I got married. That what wrong thing I have done! We can't manage even for two days. You don't need a husband but a mother! I say sir, it the mad ones laugh very nicely. The society people cry. They weep! What happened? - Nothing. If you ask the truth. Then the ones who look mad. They are not mad ones in reality. And those who don't look mad they.. Chalu! - Yes? Who named you as Chalu? My parents name was Bat-aalu! Bataata-Aloo! And they named their love as Chalu! Chalu! - Yes, sir. So you are the in charge here? - Yes. The big officer of the mad ones? - Yes! No! Junior one! You are the senior one! I have heard you steal their money. Yes! No! Look at this. If someone gives with happiness. Then I don't refuse. Hey? What? What does this contains? Sweets! - Sweets? Sweets! Go eat it; enjoy yourself! Keep it inside, sir. Doctor, there is a cat in my stomach. What are you doing? I am feeding milk to the cat, doctor. Just look, she is shaking. Hey, have you seen Hyderabad? Yes, 1 have seen. - Have you seen the Kutub Miner there? Kutub Minar? Kutub Minar is at Delhi! The Char Minar is present at Hyderabad. Oh, oh! At least it's a Minar! Go to sleep! Have you passed B.A.? Not B.A. but I have passed metric. Oh, oh! At least you have passed it. Go to sleep. Sir! Have you passed the doctor's degree? Shall I go to sleep? Cobra! Cobra! Doctor, a cobra! Where is the cobra? Doctor, a cobra! Here it is! Let him enter the hole, doctor. Let him enter the hole. He will bite me. He'll kill me, doctor. He'll kill me. Madhavi! Madhavi! Madhavi! - Hey? Chalu, it's the Superintendent sir's order. The patients should be taken for an outing. Outing? - Give me this board. You go and gather everyone. Come on! Let's go for an outing! Driver, stop the bus. Chalu, come out. Come out. Yes Chalu! - Yes, sir? I have some work here. - Yes, sir. You count all these patients and take them carefully. - Yes, sir. And listen, don't count yourself. Otherwise one mad patient will be reduced. One minute! Two! Two! Even you are going, aren't you? But there will be only one while counting. This is fine! It's matching blouse piece? I'll match it with it and send it to the hospital with the boy. All right. Okay. Most welcome! "My tresses are tangled." "Untangle them, O beloved." "Henna is adorned in my hands." "My tresses are tangled." "Untangle them, O beloved." It's mother! She saw both of us together. It seems I have come to another asylum from on asylum. Doctor, I had kept my keys here. Where are my keys? They are not here. Oh! Then they must have fallen down. Did you kept them here only? - Yes, yes, doctor. They are not here. Doctor, then they must be up there. Hey doctor, he is mad! You go out. What should I do by going out, doctor? My keys are not found. You go out. Doctor! Brother doctor, my keys are not found! Get out from here. No. Doctor! Doctor, my keys are not found. Doctor, my keys are not found. Get out from here. - Doctor! Doctor! Sir, the senior officer has sent you greetings. All right. Give my regards to him also. Hey no! What are you talking? How can I give him your greetings? Why? Oh! You are new here now. - So? By greetings it means he has called you. So say this. Sir! _ Yes? Please tell something about me to the senior officer. I am a poor man. - I have wife and kids. I have nine kids. Nine! You have nine kids!? Yes! Eight girls and four boys. That is twelve! No! Nine! Two are no more. One is here. And one is going to arrive. How many years of your marriage have passed? 13! 13 years! 13 years and 12 kids! - Yes. Chalu! - Yes? You change your name. Sir! _ Yes? Sir, it's not my fault in this but the government's fault! The government has started the family planning now. May I come in, sir? Yes, come in. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Have a seat, doctor. Have a seat. Sit! Sit! Thank you, doctor. So you have settled nicely? - Yes, doctor. Something seems to be missing! Not at all! Then you are a young man. From the time you have arrived. I didn't see a smile on your face. To always keep on smiling is sir, that.. Oh yes! I understood! I understood! That's why I keep on laughing. Young man, until one doesn't expresses craziness of living. Then it is difficult to survive in this beautiful world of Allah! Right? But you are one your place! Keep on disturbing the other mad ones. I am sorry, sir. By the way, I tolerate everything. But sometimes the matter crosses the limit. But why? I ask you who is such a man in this world. The one who doesn't have any problem with someone. Even you be having some problem! - Yes, doctor. The matter is such there is one lady at my house. Because of her I am upset all the time.. - Who? Who is she? My mother-in-law! Oh! The matter of mother-in-laws is such! Just think! What not a female undergoes!.. ...While becoming a mother-in-law from a daughter-in-law! If mother-in-law is present then only you get a wife. Right? Actually the matter is such. That lady has made my life miserable! She has brought up her daughter in such a way. As if she doesn't has any intention! As if she is a living dead body. Whatever the male says; she does only that! It is possible. That your mother-in-law has some fear regarding males. Yes, sir. She was the daughter of some very rich man. But she married one poor writer. You are not only the son-in-law of that house; but mine also! After your father-in-law went away. I searched a lot for him. You see those magazines, don't you? Gopal left Mumbai and went to Ilahbad. And there he published one edition. First he used to write on the name of Santosh and then Vivek. He became very famous as a writer very soon. His writing style disturbed Shanta. And Shanta recognised him. Then I, Shanta and Damle; we three reached Ilahbad. But before we reached there; Gopal came to know. And he left Ilahbad and went away. From that day till now; I am searching for him. You come to our house, doctor. My mother-in-law will be very happy to meet you. Hey, no, no, dear! How can I confront Shanta? I had promised here. That dear, one day I'll bring your husband. If she'll see me. Then she'll recollect her past sorrows once more. He has arrived. Oh flowers! I like flowers very much! Come on; give them to me. I will.. Hey no! They are not for you. I have brought them for mother's veneration. She will worship the statue and I'll worship her. You!? Oh! So surprising! Oh! Ask for anything! What will I get if I ask? Yes? If you ask then you get nothing! Okay darling, don't ask. Let it be! 'Shanta, you love me very much!' 'Oh God! What was I imagining?' 'I am a great sinner!' 'I'll be a sinner if I offer his flowers.' 'Oh God!' Just look how lovingly your house is decorated! My house? Oh, oh! Are our houses different ones? "I don't have anyone besides you, Girdhar Gopal!" "I don't have anyone besides you, Girdhar Gopal!" "I don't have anyone, Girdhar Gopal." "Your divine and majestic face." "I am totally impressed by you." "In all the three worlds." "There is no one like you." "I don't have anyone, Girdhar Gopal." "With great difficulty I tried and tried." "And started the saga of love." "With great difficulty I tried and tried." "And started the saga of love." "Now the love has spread and reached its height." "I don't have anyone, Girdhar Gopal." "Your devotee is crazy after you." "She is weeping amidst the world." "Your devotee is crazy after you." "She is weeping amidst the world." "Your maid.." "Your maid is sitting at your feet and weeping." "I don't have anyone besides you, Girdhar Gopal!" "I don't have anyone, Girdhar Gopal." "I don't have anyone." Mother! I don't want your flowers. After all even I am a human being. Even I have a life. This is not possible that for a lady I should.. Not a lady, your mother! Doctor! - Sit down. Listen, I was searching for Gopal from the beginning. But during these days. I have come to know something else about him. Do you see that painting? That is mother-in-law's photograph! This Chitrang? This Chitrang is actually Gopal! Your father-in-law! He left Ilahbad and went to Pune. And he presented himself as a painter. He earned a lot of money. He purchased one house also. One evening he returned back home. That time the folks were burning Holi. On one side the ladies were offering veneration. On the other hand. The people were filtering the intoxicating drink. And singing and dancing. Hey, so brother Ramraj, you are celebrating Holi in a grand way! No sir, today the Holi will be burned! - I see! Holi will be played tomorrow. I see! I see! Come Mr. Gopal, the intoxicating drink is drunk by all! Even you drink one glass. Hey no brother, I don't drink the intoxicating drink. Sometimes I drink liquor. Good bye! - Good bye! Good bye! - Good bye! Talking lovingly with the people. Gopal entered the courtyard of his house. And he saw one flower in his garden was facing him. He came inside. Then he saw Shanta's photo in front. The one which himself had painted. He stopped in front of her for a moment. And he started murmuring to himself. 'I am coming, my darling!' 'I am coming!' And sometimes even one small thing disturbs someone. Gopal had only one desire. That he'll make his wife wear the costliest sari. And he will drench her with colours. And no brave man will be able to stop him. Whatever income he used to get. He used to purchase saris with that. And within some time. His house became a wardrobe of saris. Some saris were Banarasi and some were Kanjiwaram. Some Chanderi, and some Venkatwaram. And then Bandhani, Lehriya, chiffon and many more. His entire world was that house and those saris! That day Gopal purchased the most expensive sari of his life! And even a doll with that. 'My dolly! My daughter!' 'Oh, oh! Papa, your beard hurts me.' 'So your beard hurts you?' 'So you have arrived, master.' 'Shall I serve the food?' 'No Chhotu, I am not feeling hungry today.' 'Why will you feel hungry?' 'Tomorrow you have to go to Mumbai, don't you?' 'You have to make up your unhappy relatives.' 'Yes Chhotu, I have to make up the angry ones.' 'Look at this! I have brought so superb sari today.' 'Wow! It's so beautiful, master.' 'And this doll?' 'This is for my daughter.' 'Now she must have become 4 years old.' 'Shall I keep these saris, master?' 'No Chhotu, I will get up and pack them myself tomorrow morning.' 'You go and go to sleep.' 'All right, master. Good night.' Sometimes Gopal used to think. That Shanta is very lovely! Then he used to say, no, no. His daughter is more darling to him. The one whom he has not even seen. But then he used to think. No, no! Shanta is lovelier than all the females. Shanta and his daughter! His daughter and Shanta! He didn't knew that when he'll go to them tomorrow. Then whom will he embrace first? He kept the sari under his head and went to sleep. For quite some time he caressed the sari. And somewhere far off! Someone with incomplete dreams, colours in hands. And with tears of repent in eyes was calling him! And there was a commotion of the folks outside. And it was going on increasing. Slowly-slowly their dance became a commotion. And then a havoc! Some spark fired back. And it reached the saris in some time. Gopal was sleeping. While his destiny was getting ruined! Whether the sari is Banarasi or Chanderi! It is Lehriya or Bandhani! Though it has the seven colours of the rainbow. But after burning; only one colour is left out. The colour of ashes! When he woke up; then his destiny was ruined! No one should ever be unfortunate like Gopal, my Allah! He saw his own funeral pyre burning in front of him! Just as a devotee plucks the flowers for veneration. Like that Gopal picked up the sari and doll from his pillow. 'Help! Come here! Extinguish the fire!' 'Bring water! Extinguish the fire!' 'Cool down the fire!' First he came out of the house. And then beyond understanding life. After that where he went; there is no news about that. What's this, doctor? This is the greatest day of my life, doctor Suman. To live life with some aim is so beautiful! I don't have any complains with anyone. As much love I gave to the people, dear. I have received much more than that. Do you see art? Towards this I bow out of thankfulness! The emotions are expressed in my eyes. I will not allow them to go waste. I will not let them go waste. Some immature person might hurt them. We'll celebrate that day, doctor. Oh yes, yes! We'll definitely celebrate it. We'll celebrate it together. We'll celebrate it together, dear. 'Play the colours, its Holi today.' 'Play the colours, its Holi today.' Open the door. Don't dare to put colour on me! I will! I will definitely put colour on you today. If any one drop falls on me then just see, I will.. A drop!? I will drench you from": head to toe! Today on the day of Holi; I will overcome your daily grief. Suman, you'll see me dead! You wretched fellow! You unlucky one! Mother! Yes! Do you know this? Till today I am drenched with coloured only by him! And not by anyone else! From the time he has left.. Oh, oh! He left! He left! He left! I don't know why you don't understand such a small thing. That so many years have passed; he is no more! Suman! You wretched fellow! You rascal! Who gave you this right? You scoundrel! What do you think of yourself? You do such a thing. As if I will never die! As if my funeral pyre won't be lighted! You have harassed this sad lady! May God bless you! Neither I have any daughter or son! When my husband is not my own! Then who else will be there in this world? What should I do, Santosh? Where should I go? What is my fault? That I loved you! No! - Santosh? If you had loved me then.. Santosh! Mother! Santosh, mother is not present here. Mother has gone away somewhere. Huh? Let her go! We have got rid of the trouble forever! Be thankful about that! Yes, but where will she go? Let her go anywhere. Let her wander in the lanes. Let her roam on streets, get ill-treated, beg on roads! Why are we concerned? At least she won't harass us. Did I wanted such happiness? What else happiness did you wanted? Couldn't she have lived in her bungalow? Couldn't she have lived separately living here? No! Suman, she.. she was me! I was she! Santosh! "I fell in love with a heartless fellow." "I became crazy without him." Shanta! Didn't I promise you? That I'll find out your husband and bring to you. My husband? Here is your Gopal! Dear, your Shanta! And why have you all stopped? Play together! Play together! - Happy Holi! "Beyond the gardens." "O' fair lass your beloved awaits you." "With love in eyes and glow on the face." "The sari and the blouse are drenched!" "The sari and the blouse are drenched!" "Phagun has arrived!" "O' Phagun has arrived!" "O' play Holi with your beloved." "Play Holi with your beloved." "Play Holi with your beloved." "Phagun has arrived." "O' Phagun has arrived!" Where had you gone? Where had you gone away? Such a small mistake and such a big punishment! Gopu! I have given this punishment to myself! Come on! Let's go home. Come on. Home? To my parent's house? No I will not go there. Which parent's house? I have purchased our house, Shanta. Our house! Your house! - Yes! Our house? - Yes Shanta! My house!? - Yes. My house! Shanta, where is.. where is my doll daughter? There she is! And that doll boy with her! My dolly! Come! Come to me! Come, my dear! My dear, I was desperate day and night to see you! Father! Your beard hurts me! "Beyond the gardens." "O' fair lass your beloved awaits you." "Love in eyes and glow on the face." "The sari and the blouse are drenched!" "The sari and the blouse are drenched!" "Phagun has arrived!" "O' Phagun has arrived!"
