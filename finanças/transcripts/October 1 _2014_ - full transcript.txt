Ok, sir. [BASS JOINS IN WITH 60'S MUSIC] [BRASS INSTRUMENTS JOIN IN] Danny boy! Mr. Winterbottom, sir. What are you doing here, old chap? You're supposed to be in Benin. I had to see you, sir. I'm in the middle of the independence state banquet! My apologies, sir, but it was important that I see you. This better be good. I've got a copy of this file. Not this draft, sir. [FAINT CHATTER OF PARTY GUESTS] Guard! Go to the banquet hall; summon Lord Sebastian Tomkins and Fred Ackerman. Tell them to meet me in the committee room on the first floor now. [MUSIC FROM PARTY IS NOW FAINT] Detective Inspector Danny Waziri, this is Lord Sebastian Tomkins. Good day, sir. [GRUNTS IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT] Sebastian is my senior at Eton, currently the DCO in Mombasa, Kenya. He's here in Nigeria for the independence celebration. Independence commiserations, more like. I think we'll hold on to Kenya for a few more years. And this Fred Ackerman. Fred's a retired Detective inspector at Scotland yard, currently an attaché to the outgoing Governor-general in Lagos. [CHAIR SCRAPES ACROSS FLOOR] Waziri. You're that native police officer... ...that solved the beheading of the Scotsman in Enugu, eh? Yes, sir. Hmm... Good job. Very good job. Thank you, sir. Well. Bottoms up. - To queen and country! - To queen and country! Grab yourself a chair, Dan. My colleagues are here to provide a balanced review... ...of the events that transpired in Akote. You have the report, sir. Yes, I know! I've read it, but... ...quite frankly I'd rather hear it from the horse's mouth! If you don't mind... Certainly, sir. Good man. For my benefit, I wonder if you'd mind starting from the beginning, inspector. [60'S MUSIC FADES OUT, DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS] In your own time, Danny boy. [DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES TO SILENCE] On the fifth of... ...September of this year, 1960. [TRAIN ENGINE RUMBLES, HORN ROARS, BELLS CHIME] [TYPEWRITER TAPPING] I was summoned by the district colonial officer, Rupert Winterbottom here, to Ibadan, the district headquarters for my station in Benin. There's been a murder. In fact, two. Akote, heard of the place? [WAZIRI] The trading post town? Where is the blasted file? Victoria! Ever since we constructed that link-road from Lokoja, Akote has become a strategic destination in the western region, a gateway to the north. Victoria! Yes, sir? Where is the bloody Akote murder file? Ah. [VICTORIA] By the way, sir. Mrs. Funmilayo Ransom Kuti is waiting to see you. Oh, for the love of God, what does that meddlesome old bat want? She gave me enough trouble in Abeokuta! Oh, send her through in a few minutes. And... get me a cup of tea! Coming up, sir. Here we are. Two native women. The first was found on the 1st of September. The second on the 3rd, which is two days ago. Now, in... In a few weeks' time, we hand over the government to an independent Nigeria. I don't mind a few cases of petty crime going unsolved, but I won't let a double murder slip through the cracks. You did a terrific job in Enugu. I require the same sort of diligence here. Yes, sir. Good man. You leave for Akote first thing in the morning... ...and you will report directly to me. That's all. Yes, sir. Danny boy? I require this case wrapped up before the 1st of October, Independence Day. Clear? Yes, sir. Mrs. Ransom Kuti, good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr. Winterbottom. How delightful to see you! I only wish I shared the same feeling. Please, do take a chair. Like you have a choice. [JOLLY 60'S MUSIC PLAYS] [TYPEWRITER TAPPING] [BUSTLE OF BUSY MARKET, CATTLE, FAINT CHATTER] [AFONJA] Inspector Waziri! [AFONJA] Inspector Waziri! - Inspector Waziri, sir? - Yes. Ah! Yes, sir. Thank you. Sergeant Sunday Afonja, in charge of Akote police station, sir. - How are you? - Fine, sir. My box is there. - At the back? - Yes, yes. - This one, sir? - Yes. - This one? - Yes. [RUMBLE OF ENGINE] [VOCALS ACCOMPANY MUSIC] [RADIO SHOW PLAYS FAINTLY, AWOLOWO DELIVERS SPEECH] ...of millions of people for generations to come... ...will be affected by the wisdom which we are displaying. If Nigerian leaders and our British partners... ...are to prove themselves worthy of their trust... ...now is the time... ...for us suddenly and truly to dedicate ourselves... to seek... [BOOK SLAMS SHUT] [OFFICER 1] Who is our representative now? Please... ...let's pay attention to Awolowo's speech, eh? We can solve these problems. But, is it Awolowo we should be listening to now... ...or Akintola? Even I'm confused by the whole thing. What is so confusing about it, eh? Akintola is the premier in Ibadan, while Awolowo leads the opposition in Lagos. [OFFICER GRUNTS] But, Tafawa Balewa and NPC won the most seats at federal level. So, what's with Awolowo and his party... Shh, please. Officer on deck! In 1960 it's imperative... These are my people. At ease. - Very good, Afonja. - Yes, sir. You men, carry on. Freedom! [CROWD LISTENING TO RADIO SHOW CHEER AND CLAP] [RADIO FADES OUT, SINGING CAN BE HEARD] Independence is three weeks away. Ah! No. It is the prince. Prince Aderopo has returned. The only son of the king of Akote. He just finished University in Ibadan. The first graduate here in Akote. Future king? Eh... future leader! Future premier! [SINGING FADES OUT, BIRDS TWEET FAINTLY] - Afonja, get inside there! - Yes. [SORROWFUL, SOFT MUSIC PLAYS] [WAZIRI] Signs of discoloration... ...around the neck, suggesting strangulation. Ah, same as body number two, which means they suffered the same fate at the hands of the assailant. [WAZIRI] Hmm... The thinness and neatness... ...suggest that the weapon used must be a razor. A-ha. There is blood around the vagina. The amount of blood suggests... ...vaginal rape was committed. [WAZIRI MUMBLES] - Afonja? - Sir! [WAZIRI] The sheets, the sheets. Afonja, the sheets! The women, they scare me. I knew them when they were kids. [GRUNTS IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT] All the young women in Akote are virgins. It's dishonorable to lose ones virginity before marriage. [AFONJA CHOKES, GASPS FOR AIR AND WRETCHES] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [CRICKETS CHIRP] You see? It's just there, sir. - Where? - Here, sir. This is where we found... ...the second body three days ago. - Where I'm standing? - Here, sir. Ah. Why didn't you follow correct police procedure? You should have sealed off the crime scene so... ...possible evidence is not contaminated. The killer could have left vital clues behind... ...to help us in our investigation. - Yes, sir. - Sergeant? Sir? There is more to solving a crime than finding a dead body. Who discovered the body? [AFONJA HESITATES] The farmer who owns the land, Agbekoya. And the second body? The second body? Her mother. [DISTANT SOUND OF CUTTING] Who is that? Koya. [AFONJA DOES A TRIBAL CALL] [KOYA REPLIES WITH A TRIBAL CALL] He's there. Koya. Hello! Do you speak English? What's he saying? Ask him if he saw anybody on his farm the day the body was found. He said I should ask if you saw anybody on your farm... ...the day the dead body was found? How am I supposed to know? I am a very busy man. And that's how we go about our business. If we notice anything odd, we notify the police. If we don't see anything, we go about our own business. I can't report what I haven't seen. He said no. All that he said in Yoruba, meant no? Yes, sir. Ask him if he had seen the victim before on his farm. He said I should ask... if you had ever had seen... ...an incident like this on your farm. I hope I haven't gotten myself into trouble. Is it a crime that I came to explain what I saw on my farm? Next time, we won't come to you. Please, you should leave now! - He said "No!". - He said "no". - And he has work to do. -Yes, sir. [SOFT, SOMBER MUSIC FADES IN] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [RECORD PLAYER CRACKS] [SOULFUL JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] [MUSIC FADES OUT, CRICKETS CHIRP] [FAINT CHATTER IN YORUBA] [ADEROPO] My king. [KING] Aderopo, my son. Are you going out? [ADEROPO] Yes. I'm meeting up with a few old friends. That's good. But listen. There's a lot of tension in town. Whenever you go out, take a palace guard with you. There is tension in town. I am sure... ...you have heard about the recent killings. One needs to be careful. Any outing you do must be done quickly, so you can return on time. It will be well with you. I shouldn't be frightened in my hometown. I walked the streets of Ibadan without fear. I agree, but take a palace guard along when going out. Go and come back early. - It will be well with you. - I will be careful. - Go and come back safely. - Thank you, father. The dog's forearm, the dog's arm, The horse's thigh, the ram's hoof. Big brother Sunday. - Big brother Sunday Afonja. - Prince! - You still recognize me? - Of course, I do. - You're a sergeant now? - Yes. Kudos! - It means well-done. - Yes, sir. This is my inspector, Danladi Waziri. Waziri. - A northerner? - Originally from Kano, but I was based in Benin. Seems you are a long way from home. He was sent here to solve our murder case. [SIGHS] Such a tragedy! Well... All the best with your investigation, inspector. Thank you, your highness. Yes, sir, yes, sir. [SHEEP BLEAT IN DISTANCE] [BABA IFA] Kabiesi. What this Ifa divination says is that... ...we must perform rites to appease the gods, in order to avert perilous times through the land. So that we may not fall into perilous times. [OTHERS MUMBLE IN AGREEMENT] What does the sacrifice entail? What is required? For the sacrifice, the oracle prescribes a strict curfew with the bull-roar... ...to enable us to cleanse the land of all evil spirits and calamities. Now listen, I don't want any delay. Look for all that is needed and do the sacrifice immediately. I believe our ancestors will definitely accept our offering and answer our prayers. That will be all. - All hail the king! - Thank you. It will be well with you. [KING] We shall see no evil. [CHEIVES] Amen. I said why are you reporting to me. [TAWA GIGGLES, MUSIC PLAYS IN BAR] [FAINT CHATTER OF PEOPLE IN BAR] Ah! Ropo! - Quite an age. - Indeed. [GREETING AND LAUGHING] I do believe I see a pot-belly. Ah, this, a sign of independence. Independence of Nigeria or of your waist line? And of course, the lovely Miss Tawa. Ropo. You should have written more. Indeed, I should have. Tawa! White man! Bring the prince a drink. Be fast! [BANJI] Your face looks different now. [ADEROPO] It's good to see you. - May I propose a toast? - Of course. To old friends. - Old friends! - Old friends! This is the important guest I've brought to see you. He is my senior officer; he was sent by the government to solve these murder cases we've had here in our town. He's the one I brought here. His name is Inspector Danladi Waziri. [KING GRUNTS IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT] Please, tell him he's welcome in Akote. The king welcomes you. Tell the king, thank you. He said, "Thank you". In addition, tell him that if we don't solve these murder cases... ...and apprehend the perpetrators, there won't be peace in Akote. Please, tell him that. [AFONJA HESITATES] Kabiesi said as long as the killer hasn't been found, a black cloud will continue to hang over Akote. Bartender, some palm wine! Let's get merry. [LOUD LAUGHTER, CHATTER IN BAR] Igbos? Ah! Yes. You see, since Akote became a trading post, we have had an influx of people from various tribes. As well as Igbos, there's just as many Hausas, Fulani, Igbira et al. We are used to it now. Yes, it's a great thing. Diluted! Just like Ibadan. Ah! So tell us, what's Ibadan like? I bet it's nice. [ADEROPO] To tell you the truth, there's a lot of fuss over nothing. Ibadan? [BANJI HESITATES] What is the meaning of that? Etiquette rule number 5, Banji. Don't interrupt a gentleman while he's sipping his drink. [ALL LAUGH] So, what does all that mean? Green-white-green everywhere; patterned Ankara aplenty; optimism as high as the hills of Idanre. And you did not share in that optimism? [BANJI MAKES HESITANT NOISES] Our school headmaster, Mr. Olaitan. Prince Aderopo. My pleasure. The pleasure is also mine. - Do join us. - Oh! Thank you. Thank you. [BANJI] He said take a seat. Thank you so much. [CHUCKLES] [GLASSES CLINK] [ADEROPO] Anyway... My educated opinion tells me... ...independence has arrived ten years too early. [SHOCKED SILENCE, DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] He's in turmoil, in pain. He wants to be free, but he's indecisive regarding his course of action. - What did he say? - Who, Baba? [AFONJA] He's talking about the killer. [BABA IFA] He's in turmoil, a deep seated inner crisis. We're yet to witness the last of his killings. He said the killer is in bondage. And he will kill one more time. Baba! Who is the killer? [DRAMATIC MUSIC CREATES FEELING OF MYSTERY] He said he will kill again. Lord Lugard woke up one morning in 1914, had a cup of tea, and threw us all together and said, "Behold Nigeria"! Meanwhile, the tribes can't stand each other. I think our Prince here is an advocate for Adunni Oluwole. Who is Adunni? She was a female politician. She believes Nigeria isn't mature enough to be independent. She died a few years ago and hopefully the idea died with her as well. Hmm... Mark my words. Within seven years, this country will be at war. At war? With who? At war with itself. [GROUP FALL SILENT IN SHOCK, CRICKETS CHIRP] I'm going to leave now. Tawa, do you mind if I walk with you? You see, our streets are no longer safe at night, what with all these happenings. [BANJI MAKES HESITANT NOISES] That's kind of you, Mr. Olaitan. Ropo, how long will you be sticking around for? Hmm... A few weeks. I recently applied for a regional scholarship for my Master's degree in England. Wow! I'm awaiting approval. That's good. I hope to see you again sometime. [ALL AGREE] - Goodnight! - Goodnight. [OLAITAN] I don't like him at all! I don't like him. [TAWA] Ropo? He's just a big tease. I find him rather belligerent! Belligerent? Mr. Olaitan, that's a lovely word. He's quite keen on Tawa. Eh? Uh-huh. They've been courting for a while now.

Bisi, my love, I was only messing with you. I didn't find it funny! Not with the recent killings of our townswomen. Okay, please don't be mad. [BISI CATCHES HER BREATH] And what took you so long? I have been waiting. I was assigned to a job. I was escorting the Prince. In fact, I'm still on duty as we speak. You and this work of yours. Does that mean you can't stay long? Let's hurry up and get married, so we no longer have to sneak around like this. Sumonu, you know I love you. I love you too, Bisi. That's good. Soon, you'll see, very soon, we'll get married. Don't worry; your wishes will be met. Bisi, you're giving me chills. Sumonu! I love you so much. - It's getting rather late. - Yes. - Let me help with the water. - Alright, thanks. Do you want me to see you home? Don't worry, I live nearby. Go, before your absence is noticed. Alright, be careful. And keep me in mind, will you? Like I ever think of anything else!

[CROWD QUIETENS DOWN WHEN INSPECTOR ARRIVES] Move away! [OFFICERS SHOUT, CROWD PROTEST] [WOMAN SCREAMS] The woman screaming, who is she? The victim's mother, sir. Calm her down, and question her. Her name is Bisi Olateru. She's from Akote. Strangulation. Mutilation. Rape. Same as the other two victims. We have... ...a serial killer here. [MUSIC BUILDS, BECOMES SERIOUS] The Mother said... ...she went out for a stroll last night, sir, and she did not return. And then this morning the women found her body by the stream. Arrange to take the body to the morgue. Yes, sir. [CAMERA CLICKS] [WAZIRI] The killer... ...dragged her over there, to the spot... ...where the body was found. [CROWD SOB] - You, Afonja, follow me. - Yes, sir. [SERIOUS MUSIC CREATES TENSION] - Sergeant? - Yes, sir. You see... ...this patch of earth? It's slightly darker. And the sun has not risen yet... ...to evenly dry it out. What does it mean? The killer sprung upon his victim at this spot. [LOUD CRASH, POTTERY SMASHES] Ah... And... This earth... You see these shrubs and this broken one? He must have jumped out of here. [GIRL SHRIEKS] He took her by surprise. [GIRL WHIMPERS IN FEAR] [OMINOUS MUSIC BUILDS, CREATES SUSPENSE] [GIRL STRUGGLES, THEN NOISES FADE TO SILENCE] [KILLER GRUNTS] [SERIOUS, MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [LOUD SOBBING] Was the victim's name Bisi? Yes, Bisi Olateru. Was she illiterate? They said Bisi finished standard three, but she then dropped out of school. [GRUNTS IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT] [WAZIRI] Bisi loves "S". [SOBS] She came here... ...for a late night rendezvous with her lover. His name begins with "S". We must find him. I'm imposing an 8pm to 6am curfew on Akote... - ...with immediate effect! - Yes, sir. Mount police check-points at every entry into Akote. Yes, sir. Send a dispatch to laboring villages... ...to source twelve extra policemen. At twelve noon, I want a roll-call of all rank and file in the station. [DRAMATIC MUSIC, SCRAPING OF TOOLS] [WAZIRI] We are dealing with premeditated murder in the first degree! Agara does not wrestle one before it trips. [WAZIRI] Stranger or kinsmen, the killer knows the lay of the land well. Like a river of blood, he moves in and out at will, at his pleasure. We have to smoke him out from wherever he receives sanctuary. He is struggling with an inner crisis. We haven't seen the last of his killings. He will keep on killing until his thirst for blood has been quenched. He's a disturbed individual, deranged, devoid of any human compassion. Talk to everybody. Question everyone. Find out anything unusual, out of the ordinary. The oracle prescribes a strict curfew with the bull-roar. [MUSIC FADES OUT, LOUD RACKET, VILLAGERS SCREAM] Residents! Visitors! Men! Women! [CROWD QUIETEN DOWN TO LISTEN] My Lord, the King of Akote, has asked me to inform you all, both the living and the unborn, that given the happenings in Akote, the elders have decided to do a cleansing... ...with the bull-roar tonight. If your goat goes missing, search for it. If your sheep goes missing, search for it. But strike the thought of searching for your child from your mind, should he or she go missing! It's the head of the stubborn that litter the evil grove. [LOUD BANGING, PANICKED CROWD] [DRAMATIC MUSIC RECOMMENCES, SHRILL VOICES OF PANICKED CROWD] [WAZIRI] Why does he kill? What drives a man to such insanity? Why are the murders taking place in Akote? And if by chance, you come into contact with the killer... ...you must blow your whistle. Do not attempt to tackle him by yourself. Be careful. Be vigilant. Be watchful. Beware! Dismissed! [WINTERBOTTOM] So... At that point, you had no indication whatsoever as to who the killer may be? That is correct, sir. Three murders, no suspect, no motive. Talk about shooting in the bloody dark! [SILENCE] May I have a glass of water, sir? [CHAIR CREAKS] Inspector Waziri, I noticed whilst reading through your case file... ...that you and your number two, er... Sergeant... Sergeant Sunday Afonja. Thank you. Sergeant Sunday Afonja, you and him had a sort of disagreement... ...resulting in disciplinary action. What caused that? A strain in the chain of command. A strain? Seems to me you had a full scale mutiny on your hands! For a whole week, my men were conducting door-to-door questionings of almost everyone in Akote. [SILENCE] [REFLECTIVE MUSIC BUILDS] [WAZIRI] Yet we came up with nothing. And then we discovered yet a fourth body. [MUSIC BECOMES SOMBRE] She was just seventeen years old... ...and had gone to buy kerosene one evening, ...just a stone's throw away from her parent's home. [MUSIC BECOMES DARKER, CHANGES MOOD, FADES OUT] Frustration was setting in. I felt the need to shake the tree and see what fruit would fall. [WAZIRI] Two weeks, four dead bodies, yet we still haven't solved the case or arrested the killer! These murders cannot be random. Something connects these women! They were all virgins, sir. Exactly. Purity, essential for sacrifice. No, sir. Like I said before, there are no human rituals here in Akote. Put your sentiment aside, Sergeant. We are dealing with four dead bodies here. This "X" carved into the chest, what does it mean? "X"... [HESITATES] It could mean the roman numerical ten, sir. Ten! Ten what? Ten motives, ten victims? What? [PENSIVE SILENCE] And the third victim, she had a boyfriend, a lover, somebody dear to her, who she had planned to meet that night. His name begins with "S". [AFONJA HESITATES] But we made enquires. People said she wasn't courting. She must have been courting secretly. The killer is still at large. We must smoke him out, dig him out! We are digging, sir! Well, you have to dig deeper! [SERIOUS MUSIC BUILDS] He's going to kill again. The next victim could be your sister, your girlfriend, or your fiancée. We must dig him out. You heard the inspector. Send all the men to investigate through the hamlets, from one farm to another. We have done all we can, but as you can see, he's not satisfied. So go out there, and intensify the investigations. Yes, sir. Listen. We need to bring Baba Ifa in for questioning. He predicted more killings. He knows more than he's telling us. - Arrest him! - That's an abomination! What? Taboo! The Ifa priest? Orunmila! The high priest! He's custodian of the Ifa Oracle. Arrest him? It's a bad idea! I want him brought in for questioning, and that is an order! I can't obey such an order. There is no policeman in Akote who can arrest Baba Ifa. No policeman. Sergeant Sunday Afonja, you will face severe disciplinary action for disobeying a direct order. It's better to lose one’s job than to commit a taboo. Sergeant Sunday Afonja, ...you are hereby suspended for insubordination. - Corporal? - Yes, sir. [MUSIC TAKES MENACING TONE] Sergeant, hand over your warrant I.D card and firearm. Omolodun, you are hereby appointed acting interim sergeant. Take a roll-call of all the policemen on duty. And follow me to the palace. [MUSIC FADES OUT] Left, right. Left, right, left, right, left, right.

A four year degree program can be quite tasking. [SCHOOLCHILDREN TALK, TAWA SIGHS] Ok, I thought you'd have come in, so that I could introduce you to my class. You know your story is quite inspirational. - How do you mean? - Ropo? You and I were in the same class for years at school, before you were chosen to be Reverend Dowling's beneficiary, and he became your guardian. [TAWA SIGHS WISTFULLY] I went to Modern school and teacher's Training College. But you Ropo, you attended King's college in Lagos. And now, you are a graduate. Isn't that remarkable enough to warrant an introduction? [ADEROPO FALLS SILENT, CHILDREN SHOUT IN BACKGROUND] Hurry up, or I'll welt you so hard, you'll see your Mom and confuse her for your Dad!

[TAWA LAUGHS] The teachers just have tea and biscuits in the staff room. Then live a little, unless your boyfriend will take exception. My boyfriend? [CONFUSED SILENCE] Headmaster. He and I are only friends and colleagues. I hear you. What does that mean? Let's just go to the palace. [SOMBRE MUSIC] [OMOLODUN] This situation with Mr. Afonja, I think it's best we settle it, sir. [WAZIRI] The sergeant disobeyed an order from a superior officer. [OMOLODUN] Some say he had good cause to disobey that order, sir. [WAZIRI] You speak very good English. Did you attend standard six? [OMOLODUN] Modern school, sir. [WAZIRI] Modern school. Why haven't you applied for officer training? [OMOLODUN] I did my officer selection exam last month. But it's not for the police force. For the Nigerian army. I'm awaiting my results, sir. [WAZIRI] Are you... Are you married? [OMOLODUN] No, engaged to Yejide. She's trainee nurse at Ilesha, sir. [WAZIRI] You see... It is good for one to be married, for one's progress in life. And... We are police officers. [OMOLODUN] Yes, sir. [WAZIRI] We must obey orders. If there is a break in the chain of command, there will be anarchy. But, sir, Sergeant Afonja... - Hello. - Ah, good day. Sergeant Afonja, is very popular with the rank and file. Tembeleku has come to terms with danger. It knows the nature of danger, it isn't unfamiliar with hazard ...which divines for the tortoise who is friends with the tiger and the bush rat. It kills on the farm. Tembeleku has come to terms with danger. It knows the nature of danger. It isn't unfamiliar with hazard. Ifa does not reveal the identity of the person. But Ifa says the person will kill again. He's saying he does not know the assailant, but Ifa said he will kill some more. Ask him, how do I know he's speaking the truth. How do I know the killings are not some form of human ritual sacrifice... ...of which he's the chief executioner? [CRICKETS CHIRP] The inspector says I should thank you, and that he's also grateful for your cooperation. He said I should ask how we can possibly apprehend this killer, before he kills again. Ifa says that... ...the killer will continue... ...until he's had his fill, and then he'll be caught. He said the killer wants to be caught, sir. Do you want me to bring him in for further questioning, sir? No. Baba Ifa, thank you. Thank you, Baba. [SOFT, PEACEFUL FLUTE MUSIC] [CHICKENS CLUCK] [INTENSE BONGO DRUMS CREATE TENSION] [OMOLODUN] Sumonu! Who is that? Sumonu, the palace guard, sir. Sumonu! And you are standing here! Apprehend him! Sumonu! Stop there! [INTENSE MUSIC BUILDS] [VILLAGERS SHOUT, OMOLODUN SHOUTS] [MUSIC BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO] Please, officer, I didn't kill her. I'm not the one. When I left Bisi by the stream, she was alive and well. Then I ran back to the coconut bar... ...before Prince Aderopo left for the palace. [OMOLODUN] When I left Bisi by the stream, she was alive and well. Then I ran back to the coconut bar... ...before prince Aderopo left for the palace. [WAZIRI] Why did you hide your relationship with her? [OMOLODUN] Why did you hide your relationship with her? [SUMONU GROANS] You see, Bisi was literate. She could read and write in English. I, on the other hand, I'm illiterate. And her mother would rather have her marry an educated man. [OMOLODUN] Bisi, she went to school. She could read and write in English. But me, I'm illiterate. Her mother wanted her to marry an educated man. [WAZIRI] Why didn't you come forward when we were looking for the killer, and you were her lover? [OMOLODUN] Why didn't you come forward? You see, I know that I should have come forward... ...but I was afraid. I was greatly terrified. [OMOLODUN] He said I know, but I was scared. [WAZIRI] You! A palace guard, afraid? I don't believe you. You wanted to have your way with her, she was a virgin, she refused, you got angry, you raped her, then killed her to cover your tracks like you did with the other women. [OMOLODUN] You, a palace guard, afraid? A big lie. Admit it, you wanted to have your way with her, but she refused, and then you killed her like the others. No! no! no! I'm not the one who killed her. Officer, I'm not the one who killed her. I loved her! We loved each other, I'd never have harmed her. [OMOLODUN] He's saying, "No, I love her, I love her, I can't have killed her." [WAZIRI] We shall see. Keep him in detention until further investigation. Find out whether there is any connection between him and the other three women. [OMOLODUN] Yes, sir. Inspector, please, don't leave me here. [LAMENTING] I didn't kill her! [LAMENTING] I didn't kill her! I'm not the killer! [SUMONU SOBS] [BIRDS TWEET] Omolodun. It's the men, sir. They demand you reinstate the Sergeant. Demand! What insolence! They will all face disciplinary action. Their loyalty is to Queen and country, not the sergeant. Very soon Queen and country will not mean much here. Things are changing, people are changing with the times. We need the rank and file. And the rank and file need Sergeant Afonja, sir. Omolodun. Please, go. [SOMBRE MUSIC] [BIRDS TWEET] So, Sumonu was definitely here with you on the night of the 6th of September? [MUSIC FADES OUT] Yes, it was the day I arrived from Ibadan. I was here socializing with old friends. He was here the whole time? Yes, I assumed he was. For how long were you here? From 8pm till around 11pm. So, it is possible he might have sneaked away, and come back to the bar without your knowledge? Well, it is possible, but... ...I was drinking and merry, and I wouldn't have noticed. Thank you very much for your cooperation, sir. Don't mention it. Listen here, old chap. Sumonu is a palace guard. Do you really think he had something to do with murdering all those women? That is what I'm here to determine. Good night, your Highness. [CHURCH BELLS CHIME, MOURNFUL MUSIC] [TYPEWRITER TAPPING] [CANON AKUFORIJI] Before we sing the next hymn, let us spare... ...a thought for the families and loved ones... ...of the four townswomen who prematurely departed us. May God render them support... ...in their hour of need. Turn your hymn books to 105: Join with me. [MUSIC TAKES SERIOUS TONE] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [CHURCH BELLS CHIME] [CHIMES FADES, FAINT MURMUR OF CROWD] [DISTANT AFRICAN DRUMS] - Inspector, sir. - Omolodun! [BOTH CHUCKLE] - How are you? - Fine, sir. I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Yejide. She's here for the weekend from Ilesha. Miss Yejide, nice to meet you. David speaks so highly of you, sir. - And we have more good news. - What is this? [OMOLODUN CHUCKLES, WAZIRI GASPS] - Your letter of army selection. - Yes, sir. I'm going to England, for the royal Academy in Sandhurst, sir. In one year you'll be a lieutenant. And married too! - You must be very proud of him. - So very much, sir. I need to discuss some issues with him. Sir. The men are still refusing to come back to work. And we need the rank and file. It's your day off. Go and have a nice time with your fiancée. [DISTANT AFRICAN DRUMS] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [WAZIRI] At first, I thought it was an "X" carved into the chest. But now, I believe it's a crucifix. A cross? Who would want to commit such a depravity? Canon, resentment, anger, or vengeance. May God have mercy on him, for he knows not what he does. Canon, did the diocese... ...experience any animosity from the people of Akote? Not at all. The St. David's chapel has been in Akote now... ...for thirty years. I took over from the late Reverend Dowling when he was transferred to Lagos. Dowling? Was he British? And a tough act to follow. He contributed so much to the community, especially in areas as such as education. Yes, establishing the very first primary school, and the library. He even sponsored the king's son... ...throughout his time at King's college. Oh, yes. Christian or Muslim, inspector? The latter. [CANON CHUCKLES] But you don't go to the mosque anymore, right? Canon Kuforiji, I'm not here to dwell on my faith, or the lack of it. So, where is your moral compass then? Canon Kuforiji, I believe there is good, there is bad, which religion has no bearing whatsoever. [CANON CHUCKLES] Inspector, you lost someone very dear to you, and that loss rocked your faith. [SILENCE] My loss does not allow me to seek vengeance. But are you still angry now? [MOURNFUL MUSIC] Canon Kuforiji, I'm here to look for the killer, not to find my faith. Canon, thank you very much for your time. And please have a wonderful day. I will pray for you to find both. [MUSIC FADES OUT, CRICKETS CHIRP] [TYPEWRITER TAPPING, OWLS HOOTS] [RADIO PLAYS FAINTLY] [STATIC OF POOR RADIO SIGNAL] Hello, young man. I'm looking for the Sergeant. [RADIO SHOW BARELY AUDIBLE OVER STATIC] Inspector. Sergeant, I'm sorry to bother you at such a late hour. Come in, come in. It's ok, it's ok. Come in. - It's ok. - Welcome. Sit down. Sit down. We're eating, break bread with us. [AFONJA MAKES HESITANT NOISES] Two Sergeants in this house. He reminds me of my son. Eh? You have a son of his age? [SAD SILENCE] I used to have one. [AFONJA SIGHS SADLY] My husband. I hope he doesn't have an ulterior motive for being here. Because if this Mallam has come to sack you, may Soponna make him choke on the food he's eating. [AFONJA AND HIS WIFE CHUCKLE] My wife said she hopes the food is nice. Oh, delicious, delicious. - What does he know? - Don't mind him. You think Sumonu is the killer? Unlikely, but, could it be a mere coincidence... ...that the murders ceased when he was arrested? - Sergeant? - Sir. Your action of insubordination borders on misconduct. But you acted out of principle. Consider your ten day suspension... ...enough punishment. Ah! Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You are hereby reinstated as sergeant. My men will resume work now. - Omolodun. - Good evening, sir. Another girl is missing. [INTENSE MUSIC] [OMOLODUN] Chidinma! Chidinma! [WAZIRI] Who is this Chidinma? [AFONJA] She's the daughter of a local hunter, Okafor. [MUSIC CREATES TENSION] [AFONJA] An only child, the apple of his eye. [WAZIRI] Ok, now, listen everybody! Spread out now! Understood?

[AFONJA] This means that Sumonu... [OKAFOR SOBS] ...cannot be the killer. What? Sumonu, the palace guard, cannot be the killer. He's still in custody. [HASTY FOOTSTEPS] [OMOLODUN] Stop! [THRILLING MUSIC, EVOKES SENSE OF CHASE] [AFONJA] Corporal Omolodun! Omolodun? Where did he go? We heard a sound, inside the bushes, and he went there to look. And he went by himself alone?

[WAZIRI] Who is he? He's Hausa. Nobody knows him. See, we saw him with this. It belongs to Chidinma. [WAZIRI] What is your name? Brother, may Allah be praised! I am Usman Dangari. [WAZIRI] From where? From Kafachan. I swear in the name of Allah, it was not me! - Sergeant. - Yes, sir. [LOUD COUGHING] Arrest and detain this suspect. Get up! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! [DOG BARKS LOUDLY, FIRE CRACKLES] [MOURNFUL MUSIC, CREATES SOMBRE ATMOSPHERE] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [USMAN] In the name of Allah, I did not kill the woman. [WAZIRI] Stop! Don't swear upon any religion! What were you doing in the forest? [USMAN] I was travelling from Sagamu. I was on my way to Kafachan via Lokoja. I planned to spend the night here in Akote, so that I could take the first bus... ...to Lokoja in the morning. [WAZIRI] What time did you arrive here? [USMAN] Late, around 10pm. [WAZIRI] Liar! Since the curfew was imposed, buses do not arrive in Akote after 8pm. What time did you arrive in Akote? Please, Officer, I did not arrive by bus, I travelled by foot. You trekked 500 kilometers from Sagamu to Akote? I didn't have enough shillings on me... ...to pay my fare. So I walked, and hitched rides in cattle lorries... ...for three days and nights. How did you pass... ...the police checkpoint walking into Akote? I didn't see a checkpoint. - Afonja! - Yes, sir. What happened to the policemen at the checkpoint into Akote? [AFONJA HESITATES] The officers joined in with the search for Chidinma. I was looking for somewhere to stay, when I saw people carrying lanterns into the forest. So, I followed them. [WAZIRI CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY] Are you mad? So, you just followed people... ...without knowing where they were going, or what they were doing? But I couldn't catch up, so I turned back, and then I got lost. [SILENCE] You found your way from Sagamu to Akote, but you got lost in a small forest? In the name of Allah... [WAZIRI] Stop! Where did you get that? That is what I was about to tell you. Eh? When I was looking for a way out of the forest, I saw a man. You saw a man? I called out to him, to ask for directions, but he ran off, and dropped that necklace. Describe this man you saw. It was very dark. Before I could get any closer, he disappeared into the forest. It is pretty. I was going to sell it, and use the money to buy food on my journey tomorrow. [USMAN HESITATES] I was still looking for a way out of the forest... ...when the townspeople pounced on me. Have you been to Akote before? Never! I normally travel through Ilorin... ...to get to the north, but the new Akote-Lokoja road is faster. [WAZIRI MUTTERS UNDER HIS BREATH] Do you know these women? I don't know these women. What about this one? - I don't know them. - You say you don't know them? [USMAN MUMBLES] Sir, there is a problem outside. - Problem? - Yes, sir. Take this suspect and detain him and release Sumonu. [USMAN SOFLTY HUMS "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN" ] Can you repeat that? The man in the forest, he was whistling. Mister man. Repeat it. [USMAN SOFLTY HUMS "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN" ] [WAZIRI] "God save the queen". "God save the queen". [LOUD CHANTS FROM OUTSIDE] - Come. - Yes, sir. [CROWD] Anger is consuming us! [AFONJA] Stop! I said stop! [CROWD STOP CHANTING] What is this? It's the Igbo community. Sergeant, your inspector here and the Hausa killer, they are brothers. We don't trust him. He is your brother, isn't he? But he being my kinsman has no bearing on this case. We heard about your story in Enugu. [CROWD SHOUT IN AGREEMENT] You sent our brother to be hanged for killing a white man. You, you don't like us Igbos. You don't like us at all! [CROWD SHOUT PASSIONATELY] Stop! Release him now or we'll take him by force. Release him now! This police station, with all its occupants, are under the protection of her majesty queen Elizabeth, the Queen of England and the Commonwealth. Any attempt... ...to storm this facility, ...and all of you will be shot. [CROWD FALLS SILENT, FIRE CRACKS] [CANON KUFORIJI] The soul will journey towards the Lord, its creator.

[WOMAN SCREAMS] [MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE DECEASED] [WAZIRI SNEEZES] Bless you, inspector. Thank you, sir. [ADEROPO SIGHS] Such a horrid affair. The king asked me to pass his condolences to the rank and file of your police unit. They will hear, sir. Well, the silver lining in this cloud is that you've... ...apprehended your killer. [WAZIRI HESITATES] You don't seem certain, inspector. Well, we have a prime suspect. I see. I leave the shores on October 1st. Ah! Independence day? Yes, the... ...Western Regional Government has approved my scholarship. I'll be leaving for further studies. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. [BIRDS TWEET] [EERIE SILENCE BROKEN BY BELLS CHIMING] That is how far I've gotten with the investigation, sir. The detainee in your custody, what's the chap's name? Usman Dangari. But I'm not certain yet, that's why I need a little more time. Unnecessary. Transfer him to Agodi prison in Ibadan tomorrow. They'll take it from there. Yes, sir. Governor-General Robertson is on a farewell visit to Lokoja. I'm on the advance team. If we leave now, we can make it there by nightfall, sir. The road from Akote to Lokoja is very good, sir. Yes, I commissioned that stretch of road, but Ahmadu Bello and Awolowo are taking all the bloody credit. Tough luck, eh? Jolly good work, boys. [WAZIRI] This way, sir. How delightful! Parade! Shun! - As you were, sergeant. - Yes, sir. Well, rest assure you'll receive a commendation for this. Thank you, sir. Report back to your post in Benin, in the morning. Yes, sir. Cheerio. [TRUCK ENGINE RUMBLES] [BIRDS TWEET, TAWA GIGGLES] Do you remember Rosemary Anieze? Yes. I remember. Yesterday, she was crowned Miss independence in Lagos. She's not half as gorgeous as you. Ropo, you have a sweet tongue. This flattery of yours will get you nowhere. You know, it is ungentlemanly for a man to stare. Miss Tawa... ...wait a minute, in all these years... ...has there ever been anybody in your life? There was someone, at teachers' Training college. In the end, it wasn't meant to be. He must be crazy to let you slip through his fingers. He won't be the first man to commit such a blunder. I'm sure the first man will soon make amends. Do you remember standard six? Our secret hut in the forest, where we studied? The secret hut. I'll never forget. Those were the good old days. I haven't been there since you left Akote. Really? It was in a terrible state. But I'm having it refurbished. - Really? - Yes. That's wonderful! But, I have a question for you. Yes? I'm not sure how it will be of any use, since you'll be leaving for England soon. You could always join me there. [STUNNED SILENCE] Aderopo, my prince, you know it is inappropriate for a lady to join a gentleman, if he isn't her husband or fiancé, in another location. I understand. I assure you that an amendment is soon to be proposed. [LIGHT, ROMANTIC MUSIC] [ADEROPO SIGHS] Do you want some? [MUSIC FADES] [USMAN] It wasn't me! Please! It wasn't me! Please! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [WEAPON WHIPS THROUGH AIR, USMAN SCREAMS AS IT HITS HIM] [SUSPENSFUL MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY AS USMAN FALLS TO FLOOR] [OFFICERS] Come here! Stop! Surrender! [WAZIRI] Arrest that man!

I did what any man should do! - Why? - It's for Chidinma. - Why? - It's for Chidinma. - Will it bring her back? - What? - Kill me! - Take this man away. - I did what any man should do! - Move! [OKAFOR SHOUTS AND STRUGGLES] [RADIO SHOW PLAYS QUIETLY] Inspector. Afonja. You're still here, sir? I'm just finishing my notes and listening to Tafawa Balewa. Inspector, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa will be here for the next five years, but you are leaving tomorrow. Please, come to a farewell celebration with my colleagues and I. I don't think so, Sergeant, I don't have a strong head for alcohol. Palm wine isn't alcohol, it is our traditional drink. My men won't be happy if you don't come. [CLOCK TICKS] [WAZIRI GRUNTS] [AFONJA] What can I say? My good inspector, here, my inspector. He's the best police detective in Nigeria. By the grace of God, they will make him the Commissioner of police. - Amen! - Amen! This is also for my brother, Corporal David Omolodun. May his soul rest in perfect peace. [OFFICERS MUMBLE IN AGREEMENT] Inspector, sir. Can you tell us about the man... ...who they beheaded in Enugu? It was not my finest hour. Inspector, what do you mean? You solved a big problem. Your name appeared in all the newspapers. - No? - Yes! - Sergeant Afonja. - Yes. Yes, I received a commendation, medals and a promotion. But nobody wanted to know the motive behind the killing of the white man by the Igbo man. But, they said the Igbo man was mad. Yes. No. He was not mad. He was only seeking justice, as would any one of you here, if your father was flogged to death... ...for merely stealing a chicken. Gentlemen, I must relieve myself. What a strange man! [OFFICERS LAUGH AND MOCK WAZIRI] [CRICKETS CHIRP, DISTANT WHISTLING] [MAN WHISTLES "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN" ] [USMAN SOFTLY HUMS "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN"] The man in the forest, he was whistling. Hey! You!

[SUSPENSFUL SILENCE] [COMPLETE SILENCE] [BIRDS TWEET] [STATIC FROM RADIO, SHOW IS BARELY AUDIBLE] [WAZIRI PANTS] [TYPEWRITER TAPPING] [WAZIRI GASPS FOR AIR AND SNEEZES] Inspector? - Where am I? - You're awake? Sorry, sorry. Truly, alcohol doesn't agree with you. I found you asleep on the street yesterday. My head... Oh, my head. My head aches. Maybe you hit your head on the ground. [WAZIRI SNEEZES] [AFONJA GRUNTS IN DISAPPROVAL] Stop using this ointment, my wife will cure your cold. I'll be back. [WAZIRI CONTINUES TO GASP FOR AIR] [WAZIRI SNEEZES] [AFONJA] This will cure your cold. I have to catch a bus to Benin. Put your head back down. There is plenty of time. [LOW DRONE] These murders cannot be random. Something must connect these women. When I left Bisi by the stream, she was alive and well. Then I ran back to the coconut bar... ...before Prince Aderopo left for the palace. Repeat it. [SOFTLY HUMS "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN"] God save the queen. I leave the shores on October 1st. Ah, Independence day? [DRONE BECOMES HIGHER PITCHED] [SOFT MUSIC EVOKES FEELING OF SUDDEN CONCIOUSNESS] I think I know the killer. How much would two yards of this material cost? Aderopo? - Isn't it nice? - Your royal Highness. It's very nice. I'll pay two shillings for the material. The lowest I can accept is two and half shillings. Two and half shillings is the lowest I can go. - Two and a half? - It's good material. Feel the material. You can tell it's original. And that one over there? That is different to this one. [MUSIC BECOMES INTENSE] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [AFONJA MAKES DISAPPROVING SOUNDS] [AFONJA] No, no, no! It's not possible! Prince Aderopo, the killer? No, no, no. He knows that I know that he is the killer. Yet, he mocks me, because I don't have enough evidence to arrest him. No evidence can prove that prince Aderopo is the killer. Usman Dangari is the killer. Usman? Yes. I looked into that man's eyes and I knew he was innocent. Yet, like a lamb, he was led to the slaughterhouse. Prince Aderopo is a university graduate. So, university graduates do not commit crimes? [AFONJA GRUNTS] He's a very good man. All the village girls would like to marry him. How could he possibly rape or kill women? Answer that? I don't know. You see? Ok, another thing. The first two victims were killed before Prince Aderopo's arrival. How does that correspond with your logic? What? What? You see? Prince Aderopo arrived on the same day as you. You saw him on the horse, didn't you? I just know that he is the killer. Nonsense. Usman Dangari is the killer. Prince Aderopo is not the killer. It's because he's a Hausa man like you, that's why you won't accept it. Case closed. This is the time for you leave Akote, sir. [SUMONU AND OFFICER SPEAK IN YORUBA] What is it you want from him, sir? According to your statement, when you returned from the street, was the Prince still at the bar? [OFFICER SPEAKS IN YORUBA] [SUMONU RESPONDS] - He said just like that, sir. - Exactly like what? When you returned to the bar, was the Prince there? [OFFICER SPEAKS IN YORUBA] [SUMONU RESPONDS] He says he didn't meet the Prince there but he followed him to the palace. So, you saw him walking to the palace? [SUMONU AND OFFICER SPEAK IN YORUBA] He says the Prince was asleep when he got to the palace. So you didn't physically see him in the palace? [SUMONU SPEAKS IN YORUBA] He says he didn't see him with his eyes, but he was there. So, if you did not see him, how do you know he was asleep? [OFFICER SPEAKS IN YORUBA] [SUMONU SPEAKS IN YORUBA] He says, what does it matter? The Prince must have been in his room. [FAINT CHATTER OF SCHOOLCHILDREN] Children, they've brought more. Come. Count them, everything must be complete. If you find one that isn't in the straw, put it there. I will come back and check on you. Mr. Teni, let's put this thing here, there and spread it out. Ah, miss Tawa. - How are you? - Fine, inspector. How I wish I could dance. But unfortunately, I have two left legs. I'm sorry, sir. We are so glad the murders are finally over. - Do you mind sir? - No, no, no, please, go ahead. I'm just stretching my legs. [WAZIRI CHUCKLES] - Inspector... - No, no. By the way, Miss Tawa, who is going to take you to the dance this evening? Ropo. Prince Aderopo. Ah... The Prince! [WAZIRI CHUCKLES] Inspector, are you looking forward to Nigeria being independent? Ah! Yes, indeed. Ropo thinks we are not ready, that it is happening too soon. No. We must be prepared to move Nigeria forward as a nation. By the way, Miss Tawa, your friend seems taken by you. Are you as taken by him? We are childhood friends. We were in the same class for six years at primary school. Before Rev. Dowling took them to Lagos. Who? Dowling? Yes. He took the two brightest boys to Lagos. And at that time, I was very angry because... ...I was supposed to have been taken, but I'm a girl. And who was the other boy? Koya, Agbekoya. He stayed in Lagos for five months. Suddenly, he came back to Akote. Since then, he... He doesn't even allow his son to go school. Very strange. Agbekoya. Agbekoya, the farmer? The farmer. You have met him? Miss Tawa, please, enjoy your happy independence celebration. Thank you, thank you. Let's move it, Mr. Teni. Agbekoya, the farmer. [BIRDS TWEET] [WAZIRI CLEARS HIS THROAT] Good evening, Koya. What does this man want today? Don't pretend you don't speak English. I know you finished top of your class in standard six, before you departed for Lagos. Son, eat up. I'm popping to the farm briefly. Primary education is free in the western region. Why don't you allow your son to go to school? Western education is bad. Hence, you became a farmer. Is it a bad profession? Maybe you should ask Awolowo where he gets money for free education. It's from the cocoa Industry. Reverend Father Dowling took the two most intelligent boys to Lagos. One ends up attending Kings College... ...and graduates from university. [SOFT, REFLECTIVE MUSIC] The other... ...returns to farm the land. How very strange. What happened to you in Lagos? - Koya? - Don't touch me! [MUSIC TAKES MENACING TONE] Don't you ever touch me! Is that what he did to you? Did he flog you? [MENACING, INTENSE MUSIC] Was he cruel to you? What kind of a man leaves Kings College... ...to come back to the farm? Koya, you had every opportunity to become somebody, but you are nobody. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Your illiterate son... ...will end up being nobody. [THRILLING MUSIC, EVOKES SENSE OF DANGER] [MUSIC BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO] [MUSIC FADES TO SILENCE] [KOYA SOBS] [SOLEMN, REFLECTIVE MUSIC] I was fourteen, and Ropo was twelve, when we left for Lagos. During the day time, we attended school. But on Thursday nights, Father would beckon us. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN, MUSIC FADES OUT] [CLOCK TICKS] Koya, it's time for evening prayers. [SOMBRE ORGAN MUSIC] That man would do unspeakable things to me in that room. Things I could not understand. Things that destroyed my soul. Afterwards... [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [SLOW FOOTSTEPS] And then, it would be Ropo's turn. Aderopo? It's time for evening prayers. Aderopo? You don't want to annoy Father now. [SOMBRE MUSIC BUILDS UP] That man violated me every Thursday for five months. I couldn't take it anymore. One day I stole some of his money, I caught a bus, and I came back to Akote. And you said nothing? How could I speak the unspeakable? I only told my father that education was not meant for me. And he accepted. What about Prince Aderopo? I pleaded with Ropo to come with me, but he desired education more than I did. I had five months of Father Dowling; Ropo had six years. How did you feel when you came back? Angry. I was angry at my father, my teachers, and the entire village. But they meant well. They never knew Father Dowling was a monster. I was a child, and they gave me to a stranger to take me away. I understand. Dowling passed away a while ago. He did not just pass away. [LOUD AFRICAN DRUMMING] [KOYA SOBS] About four years ago, they were about to make him a Bishop. He visited Akote, and was welcomed back as a hero. I just wanted to confront him and ask him why? Why me? Why us? [KOYA SOBS, DRUMS FADE OUT] [LOUD KNOCK] [SUSPENSFUL MUSIC] But as I saw him lying there, I felt the anger rise inside of me. Is someone there? Who's that? Koya? Koya, is that you? [THE REVEREND SCREAMS AND STRUGGLES] [THE REVEREND GRUNT IN PAIN AND STRUGGLES FOR AIR] [TENSE MUSIC ABRUPTLY STOPS, ALONG WITH REVEREND'S STRUGGLE] [KOYA BREATHES HEAVILY] [SILENCE] [REFLECTIVE MUSIC] His death was not investigated. He was old. Natural causes. I guess you want to arrest me now? What's done is done. I'm not here to resurrect life. I'm here to find a killer. All the victims were strangled after being raped. And a crucifix was carved into their chest. I had nothing to do with that. It was Ropo, right? Ropo was the one killing the women. [MUSIC BUILDS, EVOKES SENSE OF CONCIOUSNESS] Inspector. So, Prince Aderopo has been killing out of anger, for what Reverend Dowling did? Sergeant, six years of torture... ...is enough to breed resentment in any man. I still don't believe it. It makes no sense. Inspector, sir, telegram from the post office. Ah, thank you, thank you. You see? You see? I sent a telegram to the university college Ibadan, demanding to know the departure date of the halls of residence. August 29th, it says here. [AFONJA GASPS] A whole week before he arrived in Akote. Exactly, two weeks before the first murder, which means he must have been in hiding. [AFONJA GROANS] That is why Baba Ifa couldn't see anything. He cannot consult against the King and the King's children. From the bottom of my heart, I congratulate... ...the population of Nigeria and the people of Britain, for this happy culmination... ...of a political adventure which began in Nigeria... ...less than one hundred years ago. In the years that lie ahead, those of us who have the good fortune to lead our people... ...will need statesmanship of a high order, and God's guidance... ...in managing the affairs of our country... ...for the benefit of every Nigerian Citizen. [INTRODUCTION TO NIGERIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM] ♪ Nigeria we hail thee ♪ ♪ Our own dear native land ♪ ♪ Though tribe and tongue may differ ♪ ♪ In brotherhood we stand ♪ ♪ Nigerians all are proud to serve ♪ ♪ Our sovereign motherland ♪ Hip, hip! Hurray! Hip, hip, hip! Hurray! Happy independence! [LOUD DRUMS, SINGING CHEERING AND SHOUTING] - Inspector. - Yes? Happy Independence. Afonja, happy independence. Your cold. Your cold is gone? The herbal mixture worked perfectly. That's good. Tawa. Tonight of all nights there's something I must propose to you. Ropo, are you sure? A gentleman should do such things in private. Will you meet me at our secret hut in a bit? Ok. - I'll see you there. - Ok. Inspector. I'm confused. Why can't we just arrest him now? No, our case is purely based on speculation. But if he doesn't make another attempt to kill, how are we going to catch him? - Banji, Banji. - Yes. I'll be right back. Can you hold my flag for me? Yes. Don't be long, okay? - Mr. Olaitan. - Yes, Prince. Congratulations. It seems you're quite keen on Tawa. She turned me down, she actually did. If you ask her again you might get a different answer. She confided in me that she actually loves you. Loves me? - It seems the best man won. - Are you serious? Thank you, thank you very much. Don't mention it. She just left. She asked me to bring you to her. - Sergeant Afonja? - Sir. He'll leave Akote this morning for London. - Come with me, come with me. - Yes, sir. [DRUMS AND SINGING FADE OUT] [CRICKETS CHIRP] Is Miss Tawa along this route? Yes, she's just ahead. Eagerly waiting for you. We are getting closer. [SOUNDS OF THE CELEBRATION, DRUMS AND SINGING] - I'm inspector Waziri. - Okay. I saw you earlier with Prince Aderopo, where is he? Aderopo, I don't know. He was with Tawa. - Miss Tawa? - Is there a problem, Inspector? She might be in danger. - Danger? - Well... I might know where they are. [SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE IN FOREST] You see? That hut over there. You are such a decent man, Ropo. I shall never forget this kind gesture of yours. Don't mention it Mr. Olaitan. You shouldn't keep a lady waiting now. You are right. [OLAITAN GROANS IN PAIN, STRUGGLES FOR AIR] It's this way. - Where? - This way. This is where Corporal Omolodun was killed. What? Where Corporal Omolodun was killed. Yes. Now I see... ...how Aderopo escaped that night. This hut is barely visible. Well, only three of us know this place: myself, Tawa and Ropo. We should go now. [WAZIRI] How far is it? [KOYA] Well, when we were young... - ...it didn't seem that far. - So, hurry, let's go. Let's go. To our independent Nigeria. [TAWA GIGGLES] To us. To us. [TAWA] Mmm... Lovely. Where did you buy this wine? Ibadan? No, Lagos. When I was leaving Reverend Dowling's place. Reverend Dowling. You must miss him. [ADEROPO GRUNTS] Miss Tawa. You were the brightest student in our class. Why didn't Dowling take you to Lagos? [TAWA SIGHS] Because I am a girl. True. Dowling preferred boys. Unlucky for me. Lucky for you. Lucky for me? [SINISTER MUSIC] Lucky for me? He violated me. Ropo! You have no idea what I went through. This whole town has no idea what I went through with that monster for six years! But you will all suffer. Why? Ropo, why? Because I'm in pain, and you must all feel my pain. Six Akote virgins, for all the years of suffering I endured. [TAWA PANTS] Ropo! Wait! Wait! I'm your childhood friend. [TAWA SCREAMS, HER SCREAM ECHOES] [AFONJA] Headmaster! I think he's alive, but I can smell chloroform. What is that? It's a substance used to render people unconscious. But, why did he do this? He's being framed as the murderer. You come here and stay with him. And you go to town and get me some reinforcement. That is the hut. Ok, Afonja, come with me. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - We are childhood friends. - I didn't have a childhood! You're going to take something from me that I'd give you with all my heart? I don't want you to give it me, I want to snatch it. Just like my innocence was snatched. [TAWA SOBS AND SCREAMS] [ADEROPO] Shh... [TAWA GASPS FOR AIR AND WHIMPERS] Please. Keep your mouth shut! You are the last one, you know. The sixth virgin. I'm not a virgin. I had a lover at the teachers' Training College in Owo. [TAWA BREATHES HEAVILY, WHISPERS FRANTICALLY] [WAZIRI] Aderopo! I know you are in there. This is inspector Waziri. [SHRILL WHISTLE] [MUSIC BECOMES FRANTIC] [WAZIRI] Are you alright? [MUSIC FADES TO SILENCE] [WAZIRI] You stay with her here. Koya, do you know this forest? - Yes. - Let's go, let's go. [KOYA] This way, this way. [TAWA SOBS] [CRICKETS CHIRP] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [KOYA] Ade? [SILENCE] Prince Aderopo? I know you can hear me. I know what happened to you in Lagos. [KOYA] Ade, please, come out. I've explained everything that happened to us in Lagos. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC] [WAZIRI] You have carried this... ...mental and emotional burden for too long, allowing it to consume you. You blame this town for your predicament. You have taken so many innocent lives. Has that eased your pain? Set you free? [KOYA] Ropo. Please, let's put a stop to all this. Ade. [HIGH PITCHED DRAMATIC DRONE] [KOYA] Ropo. [WAZIRI] What are you doing? Stand back, I'll cut him. Prince, let Koya go. Listen, I didn't mean for this to happen. [MUSIC BECOMES SOLEMN] I just a wanted to get an education, to fulfil my potential, that's all. Nobody is blaming you. - Ropo. - But the pain won't go away. I know about pain that won't go away. Many years ago in Kano, I sent... ...my wife and eight year old son to buy me bitter kola. [KOYA] Ropo. [WAZIRI] A lorry carrying timber... ...had a brake failure... ...and ploughed into the market, killing several people. That was the last time I saw my wife and child. I carry... ...my pain everywhere, as you carry your anguish. [KOYA GASPS FOR AIR] I've killed too many people. - They are going to hang me. - But this has to stop. I'm a Prince, you can't arrest me. Inspector, drop your gun or I'll kill him like I killed your corporal. I can't do that. Killing one more person won't make a difference to me. It will make a difference to me. [GUN SHOT] [COMPLETE SILENCE] [HAUNTING DRONE, MIRRORS END OF ADEROPO'S LIFE] [DULL THUD AS ADEROPO FALLS TO THE GROUND] [SOFT, MOURNFUL MUSIC] I didn't want to shoot you. [ADEROPO COUGHS AS HE TAKES HIS LAST BREATH] [WAZIRI] I left Akote at dawn and arrived at Lagos this morning to submit my report. [WINTERBOTTOM] Who else is aware of this? Just a few people in Akote. [COMPLETE SILENCE] Good, it can be contained. I won't submit this file to the Ministry of Justice. It's ashes. I shall submit the original report, which clearly states Mr. Usman Dangari as the murderer. [WAZIRI] Usman is innocent. Prince Aderopo is the killer. Usman is a nobody. No ties, no family, no connections. Disposable. The Prince, however, is the university educated son of a Yoruba King with close ties to the new Premier Akintola. Not disposable. But that is not right. It's not about right or wrong, it's about reality. This newly independent country cannot stomach this can of worms. [SAD, REFLECTIVE MUSIC] That is why I want a little more time. Unnecessary. Transfer him to Agodi prison in Ibadan tomorrow. They will take it from there. I cannot sweep it under the rug. Now you listen to me! You'll do as you're bloody well told! The impudence of the man. He'd be flogged in Kenya. I'm warning you, Danny boy. Don't rise above your station. Nigeria maybe independent, but you clearly have no idea about the politics of this fragile land. An Igbo woman is killed in Yorubaland. A Hausa man is arrested and subsequently killed by the Igbo father. It turns out the Hausa man is innocent, and it was indeed a Yoruba Prince who murdered the Igbo woman and the others. No. The Nigerian government won't allow this file to see the light of the day. Case closed! Is this about protecting Nigeria, or the fact that one of your own, a man of clergy, was busy molesting young boys? - How dare you? - How dare you, sir? Is the case in Enugu not bad enough? Or do you intend to cover up all of the crimes of the white man in Nigeria? [MEN FALL SILENT IN SHOCK] You are walking a very thin line, Danny boy. Don't cross it. Because if you do, I will crush you. By God Almighty, I will crush you to bits. Your notebook, Inspector! Lay one finger on me, and you'll be up for a court-martial. Inspector Waziri. Do yourself a very big favor. Back off. [COMPLETE SILENCE] Can we please get back to the party? I'm in dire need of scotch. Play your cards right, and in a couple of years, you'll be commissioner. Happy independence, Danny boy. My name is not Danny boy. Inspector Danladi Waziri. You hereby stand corrected. [SHOCKED SILENCE] I stand corrected, Danladi Waziri. Apologies accepted. [TOMKINS LAUGHS] [ACKERMAN CHUCKLES] Don't let those buggers get you down. It's the British class system, isn't it? Bloody toffs, they just want to maintain the status quo. Copper to copper. You did a bloody marvellous job, inspector. Thank you, sir. Good or bad, it's your country now.
