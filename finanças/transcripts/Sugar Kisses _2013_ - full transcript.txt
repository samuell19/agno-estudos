SUGAR KISSES You want some? Come on, Cacayo. Can't you see I'm busy? Oh... So just say no. Drop that stuff and come help me, OK? Not even a ?please', huh? Please, man. It stinks like a nun's ass. Now you're going to start whining? I think I'm going to puke... Give me a second... Uh-uh. Move it, man. Let me at least catch my breath... There you go... You're a pain in the ass, man. Help me flip it over. And now for the magic... Gael Garcia, for men. It's going to stink worse. And this filth? Hi, Do?a Delfina. Ma sends... I'm talking to you, brat. I think it's ready to take in. Ready? Don't even think about bringing in that nastiness. You hear me, brat? Excuse me, Ma'am. Ignacio! Don't you dare, Nacho! Take that piece of shit out of my house! Dammit! Do as I say! Listen to me. Stop it, Nacho. Get that thing out of here. Get that thing out of here immediately. You hear me? You'll see what happens when your mom gets back! And you, Cacayo don't come back! And get to the stall, Joao's waiting for you! What's up with you? Move! So? What did Chuky want? What do you care, moron? What's that, thief? I bought it. I bought it my ass. You stole it. Give it here. Give it, Joao. Give it, Joao. Why the hell do you want a cell phone cover... if you don't even have a cell phone? It's mine. You're right. When you have a cell phone I'll give it back. Scam... Come on, go get Yoselin at the gym. That's how I wanted to find you... Explain to me what the hell this is. What? This sack of crap. It's my mattress. Wrong, Ignacio. This trash you brought into my house is a piece of shit. I already gave it a good going over. Even my Gael Garcia, for men. It's just like new. Don't be a pig. Take out this crap right this second. Why? Because I said so! Or you want Joao to tell you? Whoever doesn't beat him is a pussy. Come here, Nachita, you bitch. Nacha Fag, Nacha Fag, Nacha Fag! - What is it? - Police operation. - What? - Police operation. Move out. Who'd they get? The Chirimoyos. Let go of them! - Chilakill? - You bet. Let go of them! They didn't do anything! Bastards! Let go of them! You're hurting me! Get out of the way. What's up with you? No... Nothing. Grab him, he's running away! What's taking so long in there, pig? Hold on, Mom. I'm almost done. Hurry it up! I'm going to shit myself! I'm wiping! Don't bother! Get out! Dad, Nachos hiding who the hell Knows what! What did you do now, brat? Nothing. Don't play dumb. In the closet. There's nothing there, idiot. Don't call him that. Take out whatever it is you're hiding. I'm not hiding anything, Mom. Yeah? Well we'll see. Fine. Scam! Let's see... what the hell did you steal now? He hid it in the closet! Where? Where is it, piece of shit. Take it out. I don't have anything! Okay. Don't take it out. Show it to me. What? Either you show it to me or I'll show it to myself. Common! Nothing, huh, rat? And the cassette? It doesn't use a cassette, idiot. Don't try to be a macho, Nacho. Where did you rob it from? Just now, in the raid. A stupid pig dropped it. Don't call us that, idiot! I'll return it to its one and only rightful owner. I'm its one and only rightful owner! Please... Why did you let that moron steal it from me? Shut up, Ignacio. You have to thank Joao for everything you have, you hear me? My dad would never do this to me. Not this or anything else. He was a real fool. Not so much. He went to the States. That good for nothing left us like dogs... but I highly doubt he made it to the States. That's not true. You just say that. The photo says it. Turn off the light, Pupu. Go to sleep - don't let the bedbugs bite. Who is it? Get your step-dad, pussy... or I'll break you good. He's not here, Chiquibuki. Don't call me Chiquibuki, moron. He's not home, Ma'am. Of course he is, little prick. His shit lotion stinks all the way to here. Where? Cut it out. Or do you need a pair of scissors? Good morning. How could you say I'm not here, idiot. - At your orders, Ms. Lety. - The fee, pussy. Yes, in a minute. Ms. Lety. With all due respect... ...you remember that you had promised us protection?? What was with that raid Chilakill pulled off the other night? Don't be an ass. It was necessary. I can't allow just any prick to cross the line... selling or keeping unauthorized counterfeit shit in my territory. Can I? No, well no... You're only selling good merchandise, right? Of course. Only the best original pirated stuff. Porn? Only ours. The fee, man. Yes, of course. I'll bring it in a minute... if you'll just let me... if you'll just let me... They saw you ?wing Wm Chum, dean. Come on, Ms. Lety. Come on, Ms. Lety! That bitch is going to make a deal with the government... and you're going to end up in one of those malls where no one sells snit. Of course I know that. Don't worry. I do worry. I care about my people. I'm not like you guys. Sales are slow, and then we have to give part to the cops... It the problem's the cops then tell your wife that they should go easy. So you don't say again your step-dads not in, moron. You're awesome, dude. Another, huh? I'm all out. Use yours now, wuss. I used them all. So few? Yoselin took half of mine. Your kid sister? No shit, man. She's a yellow belt, dude. SQ? What? I'm waiting for you. Let's go. I was waiting for you, dumb-ass. The truth, the truth, the truth, Diabla and Chuky are expendable. What neither of them see is that they're basically just like my shoes. I have a foot stuck in each of them and they are taking me wherever I want to go. And if sales keep up like they were today, we're going to go... Where to, Blondie? You're taking me to Cancun, Honey? - Come on, Blondie. - Sorry, Honey. To our shop. To the best sex shop in Mexico. Think, love... that ours is like a clear spring... where crystal drops flow... born from my sad inspiration... What a hit! How great were those guys, Mom The best. Poets, son. Eat your pizza, Nacho. I'm not hungry. - Can I have it? - No. It seems to me, Blondie, that little Nacho here has a... Really, son? There's an ass you like? My brother has a boyfriend! Shut up. Is it a girl from your school? I bet she has a huge ass! You seriously have a chick? - What's her name? - You got him a hooker, Dad? Come on, buddy. It looks like little Nacho here has his ways. Tell us, Nacho. You doing her? Child! Write her a song. It never fails. What's her name? What's her name? Enough! Ahh, so bitter, huh? He can't stomach anything, man. He's in those tweenage years... Nacho... What? Scoot. Mom and Dad kicked me out of their bed. Really! What's up! The movie any good? Nah. It's incredibly tedious. Only cool thing is this chick with big-boobs in minute... ...87. Wanna see her? No, thanks. Playing hooky again? Of course not. I'm doing an investigation. Oh yeah yeah yeah... I have to go to the gate of a school in Polanco. Fancy bullshit, your investigation. Actually... I want to see Mayra. Who's that? Now I understand why they call her 'The Doll'. Ahhh... that Mayra. That's how they used to call her dad, 'The Doll'. They whacked him when she was going to be born. Well now she's super hot. She could use some tits. Cacayo, she does have some and she'll get more. She's my age. Just saying... I've got it... If you want to get her, let me record you dancing at the arcade... we'll put it up on YouTube... and when Mayra sees you... she'll fall head over heels. The idiot... You're a genius, Cacayo. Just don't call her that! I'll see you at the arcade in an hour. But I'm working! Let's see how you get out of it. Where are you off to so elegant, Do?a Delfina? Just going for some chicken feet. Mmm, delicious! - See you later. - OK. Did you see the pink dreads on Citlali? So raunchy. And super tacky Mayra is drooling all over her. Can you believe it? Yeah! What? You want some? Stupid pervert. Sick! How could you let that grease ball film you? Did you see that loser's face? Enough. Don't pay attention to him. What's up, Citlali? Are they coming for you or do you want a ride? Which pop do you like best, sexy? Is yours ripe cherry or do you like it creamy? Leave her alone, Brayan. Shut up your face! Fine, Citlali... Wash your ass. I've been here almost two hours, asshole! - Sorry, Cacayo- - You made me leave work! - Let me explain. - And I'm dying of hunger! Why didn't you leave then? I was just waiting to tell you to go to hell! Go to hell, Nacho! Come on, forgive me. Do you know where I'm coming from? No. But I know where you're going. Where? I just told you, man. To hell! Sorry, dude. Let me explain. I went for the camera, I checked the time and I thought I'd have time... so I went to film Mayra at her school. What? She really is a super mega babe. So you ditched me to go see stupid Mayras stupid ass? Easy, we're not talking about your mom's flabby ass. Don't mess with my mom, asshole! No, no, no. Sorry. Your mom's butt is sacred. - Of course. - Of course. Common... film me. Don't be a jerk. I have the camera here. At least let me download what I filmed onto your computer. You look sexy when you're mad, Cacayo. You don't get to eat now, brat. This isn't an inn where you arrive whenever you want and get whatever you want. What the hell are you doing in here, squirt? Nothing. Yes. I know... I hate that school, ifs horrible... I miss you, Yayis... OK. I'll see you. Bye. Take care. Why are you following me? Yes, you. What do you want? Um. I... I don't know... Who were you talking to? Your boyfriend? What do you care? You're a market vendor, right? If my mom sees me with you all hell will break loose. What do you want? You dropped them the other day. At the arcade. Thanks. I'm Nacho. Hi, Nacho. Bye, Nacho. You look cool. The pink streak. It's awesome. Thanks. I saw you on the dance floor. You danced really cool to Sugar Kisses. Oh yeah? I'd love to say the same about you, but you have two left feet. - That's what you think? - Yes. I'll challenge you to a dance round. I have to go. Yes or no? Yes, but leave now! - Just say when. - Whenever you want! - I'll see you at the arcade in an hour. - Okay. Who were you talking to? No one. Play dumb, Mayra. That shithead ?No one' has a rocket up his ass... that just sent him running. What's this'? Do you like it? Of course not, fool. I put you in that school so you'd learn to be a princess... not a whore! Goddamn sneaky slut! My Yayis told me... Why are you talking to that witch from hell... that never managed to do anything good but have her eon? She said I must look really cool. Brayan, run to the pharmacy for some hair dye for this idiot. Hurry up, idiot. I don't have all day. What color? Black? Not black. Chic Brunette, dammit. You look so hot in that dress, babe... You like it? Love it... So what if we do our Emperor Suite... dancing and the taco stand? Again, honey? Do those morons give you a commission each time we show up there or what? You can do more than that. More? You waiting for me? I'm gonna make you feel good. No... - Feels good baby, huh? - Stop it! I hate you! Do you feel some tickles? Get off me! What the hell, assholes! I saw you, man! You're so dead! I saw you, shithead! I'll rip off your balls... and then I'll make you drink them with milk... I saw you, prick! Open up, bitch! I don't have keys! Open up, dammit! Hurry up, goddammit! If you don't open the damn door I'm gonna shoot it down, bitch! Let's see what Mom says about that. Come on, Sis. I can't stay out here all night, I'll gel sick. Where the hell are you going? Mayra! Mayra! Stop it Mayra. All right, fine... but you're going to regret this, bitch. Come on, man! Screw you goddammit! Enough, open now! Stop screwing around! Open up, damn Mayra. Open the door! Goddammit, man! What's up Nacho? Can you ask Joao if he's decided? If he's decided what? You just ask him, man. Hi. Hi. Sorry. For what? For ditching you. Oh... that... You were scared of losing or what? No way. When are we going to have that dance? - Whenever you want. - In an hour? Game. And your pink dreads? See you soon. Damn Nacho. Don't tell me, idiot, that you tell for Diabla's girl? I'm talking to you! Don't you know the shit you can get me into? Whatever, fine. Can I go now? Go wherever you want... but get rid of the damn Doll before Diabla finds out. Do you understand?! Yes... Chuky came by to ask if you've decided. What's it to you. Grandma! Grandma! What is it, darling? Nothing! - Ready? - Ready? How are you going to find the camera in this mess, Joao? I put it here. Look up there... Behind the Christmas stuff. Ignacio. So. Brat... Whats going on between you and Ms. Lety's daughter? Whose daughter? Diabla's, don't play dumb. So Nacho, are you an idiot or what? Mom, honestly I have the right... Not the right or the left! It Diabla finds out that you're after Mayra like a dog in heat... you're not the only one who'll get screwed. And I won't let you mess up Joao's life with your bullshit. Stop thinking with your dick, boy. They say a lot of things about Diabla... like that she herself did in her husband. So you're going to forget about the Doll. Did you hear me? Uh-huh. Did you hear me? Yeah, sure. Yes, mom! Where's the camera, prick? You're the one who took it from me. Don't be an idiot. I don't have anything. Yoselin saw you. Ah Yoselin, stupid liar. Don't speak like that to your sister! You paid her with videogame tokens so she wouldn't say anything. That camera is mine and you stole it from me. If you lost it later, that's your problem. You don't speak to me in that tone, douchebag! Now what the hell's going on? This ass-wipe has the camera. Enough bullshitting. Give the camera to Joao. It's mine! You stole that camera from me! Give back the camera, boy. You heard your mom. I'm not giving you shit, asshole! You're not leaving here until that damn camera appears. You understand? You understand, prick? You really messed up this time. If you go out: lock it with the chain from outside. And call me if he tries anything, okay? Your blessing, Mom. Thanks. Take care. Move, fool. Can't you see I'm mopping? You don't let me hear my music. And you don't have permission to watch TV. Hello? Cacayo, it's Nacho. What do you want, jerk? They punished me. I'm locked in the house. I need you to run here. No way. Don't be nasty, Cacayo. If you come I'll give you a 'Cacayette'. Hmmm... Let me think... Go to hell. I won't be long. I'm just going for chicken feet. Ain't you gonna eat me? Sorry, footballs give me gas. It was about time, Cacayo. What do you want? I need you to do me a favor. First things first... One second. Cool... Why did they lock you in? Joao stole my video camera and I stole it back from him. And what the hell do you want? I need you to go to Mayra and... No way. You ditched me to go see that stupid chick. Forgive me, okay? It was an accident. Haven't you ever fallen for someone? Sure, man. But I never ditch anyone. I'm whipped. What can I do? Shit. I can tell you're serious about the Doll. Well, if that's how it has to be, ifs about time you sleep with her, dude. Really? Isn't it too soon? Nope. If you need a place I'll lend you my room. But how do I do it? Well first you give her some kisses and... you grab her boobies and ass and all that. And then? Then? Then you do the rest. The rest? Yeah, the rest, man, come on. And what should I tell her? Tell her I'm punished. That I won't be able to meet her. That? Yeah. Will you tell her? Hello, Ms. Delfina... The witch is on her way. Wash your crack. Cacayo... Tell her please. Well, Nachito,... has the camera appeared? Let's see if it does when you start getting hungry. Hi. Cool you came. What's up? Your friend Cacayo told me you were punished. Yeah. - You can't come out? - Nope. Wait a second. Mayra! Nacho... Thanks a lot. Not necessary, Miss. Please send my greetings to your mom, Ms. Lety. Excuse me. I'm coming... What's up, Cacayo? Are you alone? And your mom? Will she be a while? Come on, speak, man. Yeah, man. She went to her prayer group. She won't be back till tonight. You remember what you told me... this morning? - Me? - Yes. - What? - Yeah, that you offered to lend me your... Ah, sure, yeah. Come in. I'll be back later. Close the door. He paints the bras on so they don't live in sin. So he says. Why did we come here? Come. Come. What's wrong with you? Sorry, Mayra, I didn't want... Now I understand why my mom won't let me see morons like you. No, no, sorry. Cacayo told me that's how you do it. So go feel up Cacayo. - Sorry, I'm an idiot. - And you just realized that now? - Yeah, I screwed up. - Totally... I promise I won't do it again. If you want, tie up my hands. Don't be mean. I can't not see you. - You promise? - I promise. - And if not? - Just tell your mom and your brother... and I'm dead. - You are an idiot. - And you just realized that now? If I show you something. You promise not to tell anyone? Yeah, sure. Not even your friend Citlali. Of course not. Well, we are here. Last one is a wuss! Come. - Wait for me. - Come! Sons of bitches! What's this place? Come. Wow. - Cool, huh? - Yes. It kind of makes you want to }ump off, huh? Right? I bet you don't dare. Neither do you. You think they'd hold us? I really doubt it. Then what? We'd just get smashed? It depends. If we fall on the panties stall right under the green awning... I think we'd make it. You have a black head. You have a black head on your nose. Can I take it off? Do I have black heads? No. I hate blackheads. If you close your eyes you can see white heads. I don't see anything. WOW! You're right. I see them. Cool. What time is it? Who knows. My mom's going to kill me. - Are we gonna hang tomorrow? - Yeah. - At my shelter? - Yeah. Same time? Where the hell have you been, piece of shit? Your poor brother has spent the whole damn night looking for you. You? What did you do to her? - Nothing. - What did he do to you? What were you doing? - Goddam pigs. - Nothing. Just wait and see how your step-dad ends up in the mall. And just wait till Brayan arrives to finish you up, you hear me? You prick! And you get inside, fool. You've got a lot of balls, huh? A lot of balls... Do you know what time it is, fool? If you're so ballsy you can sleep in the street. Stop screwing around. And don't come back... until you bring that damn camera. Do you understand? Open the door, asshole, I know you're in there! You're dead, prick. It's Chiquibuki with three other guys. Come out or I'll come in and take you out by the balls! Open up prick! What's all this racket, Brayan? What's your problem with Enrique? With the idiot Cacayo, nothing, Ma'am. Where's that idiot Nacho? God only knows... but I swear to you he's not here. Move it, old lady! What's going on, Quique? Nothing, Ma. What the hell with you, shithead. What the hell with what? Don't do anything to him! Where are you, douchebag? You're one dead zombie! Where are you, pussy! You are dead, man! Hi. Citlali? I'm Nacho. Mayra's boyfriend. You're Ignacio? I pictured you... different. Yeah, I bet. And Mayra? She's not coming to school. Why not? She's not feeling well. What are you doing here? Are you okay? What do you want? Did they punish you? No. I'm sick. Now go. I don't want to talk to you. What did they do to you, Mayra? Please, don't close. Leave! Get out of here! Don't you get it? You're even stupider than I thought. I don't want to be with you. You're a stupid lowly street vendor son of a bitch... who only knows how to say bullshit and dance like a pussy. What's wrong with you? What happened? Nothing, idiot. Leave me alone and go to hell. Don't talk to me again. - I'm not leaving until... - Get out of here, asshole! Get out! I'm going to call my brother! What's wrong with you, Mayra? Brayan... He's here... Shh... Shut up... Silence... Kidney Soda, Nachita. You like it...? Nacha fag... Nacha fag... What are you doing here, goddamn brat! You're forbidden from entering this house! Shameless snot! They took our stand away because of you! How dare you go too far with the daughter of Diabla! I'm calling Joao right this second! We're sick of you! Asshole! But hurry. Son. I'll hold him here... You stay here until you give back my son's camera. That camera is mine and I'm selling it to Cacayo. Move. You're going nowhere! Really? What are you doing? Don't you dare! Leave that alone! My radio... My radio... My music... We're all set then, sir. Be more careful. Have a good afternoon. How many times have I told you not to interrupt me at work? I just came to say goodbye. Oh, yeah? And where are you going? I'm going with my dad. With your dad? You don't even know where he is. We don't even know if he's dead or alive. I don't care. Either way I'm leaving. Don't talk bullshit. What money are you planning to use? I'm going to sell my camera. - That camera isn't yours. - Yes it is. Give it to me. That's an order. Give me that camera and stop screwing around! You're not going anywhere! I'll throw you in jail. Idiot! That's what I'll do to see if than you'll learn! Bye, Mom. See you later. Nacho...! Chocho...! Licha, the Commander wants to talk to you. I'm coming... Son...! Hurry it up! Hey, Chuky. What's up. Nothing... Brand new model? One a day means happiness. So, what about my dough? Here it is. What? Come on. Only this?

I can prove something that will make things cool with Diabla... - What did you record? - No, nothing. - Give me the camera, prick. - This other prick has it. The camera, prick. Wait a second, Chilakill. Please, just let me check one thing... One thing, my ass. I'll check it. Please... Okay now, sexy doll, put on your cap... Oh shit! Oh shit!

Don't you get it? Come with me. Mayra. Let's go. Goddam bureaucrat... Chilakill... my ass... Oh, honey... Why do these things happen to me, huh?... For being a push oven... that's why... for being too nice, dammit. That's why this shit happens... Don't worry, Mommy. Everything will be fine. Yeah, you're right... I'm not alone. I have my Brayan. You also have me, Mom Yeah, hon, but... Brayan... Brayan... is Brayan. And you came out too much like your Dad. Mom... Brayan tried to abuse me. Bullshit! - I swear it. Brayan wanted... - Shut up, Mayra! Before he just spied on me. But the other day when I finished bathing... - ...Brayan came into the room and... - Shut up, bitch! I'm sure you've been going around... offering to spread your legs to your brother, slut! How the hell can you tell me such lies when you see me all screwed up? Selfish little shit! - Let's go, Mayra. - Where? To the States, with my dad. Look. Hey, your dad is on the Mexican side. It doesn't matter. We're going. Far. Let's go with my Yayis instead. - Who's Yayis? - My grandma. Your grandma? And your mom? It's my dad's mom. She hates her. We'll stay a while with my Yayis and then go look for your dad. Sound good? Yes or not? Have you been to the sea? Me neither. My Yayis lives by the beach... near Tapachula. But that's the other way, right? It doesn't matter. What did you say to my mom, bitch? You have to understand something, idiot. What happens between you and me... stays between you and me. You say anything again to my mom... I swear Mayra... I'll break you... into pieces... Be still...

Well I wish I was better, Chucho, but your damn Sector Chief really screwed up... What do you mean that your cop is acting in the correct manner?... What goddamn changes are you talking about? What changes do you think you can make without consulting me, huh? Don't try kissing my ass. - How else would you like me to react? - Wait here... Isn't it enough what I give you. Or shall I speak directly with the Mayor? I don't give a crap that he's a busy man, I'm also a busy woman. Don't give me that shit... So what you and the Mayor want is that tomorrow all the damn streets of the whole damn city... especially the ones in your damn District are a damn chaos... Well if that's your pussy stance, I'll just have to have a chat with the Party President. I dent think he'll like the tall in votes in the next elections... Stop, little prick! You're really dead. Chuky guarantees shit, all balls, zero votes, don't be stupid! I'll have to call you later. Say goodbye, little prick. Where do you think you're going? Brayan!
