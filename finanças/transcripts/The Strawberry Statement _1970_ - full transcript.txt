'Stroke!' 'Stroke!' 'The Soviet news agency..' 'Not gonna take this lying down.' You keep smoking in bed, you're gonna burn the place down. - 'You couldn't knock?' - No. I couldn't knock. I'm not gonna get into a hassle over some strange chic-- Woman! I'm not a strange chic. I'm a strange woman. Strange woman, getting balled in my room. On my bed. Specially, if I'm not balling her. Could you knock first? No. Who is she? I'm gonna tell you something, Simon. I'll tell you something. What? What are you gonna tell me? You gotta knock, schmuck. We gotta deal that we'll knock when we come through that door. Not in the afternoon. In the afternoon, we've a deal that we've to study. 'We learn things, get big money, big jobs, am I right?' - Mmm. - Hi, I'm Irma. Hi, Irma. Charlie's been teaching me Gaelic. Charlie is Jewish. He comes to us from the Bronx. - You've been had. - You, bastard. - Oh, don't listen to him. - I hate men. That figures. Look, he's on the rowing team. I'm not kiddin', you're all alike. - I like to row. What can I say? - He's a creep. I gotta go. - Want me to do this? - Yeah. Well, when, uh, when we gonna see you again? I'll call you tonight, Irma. I'm busy tonight. - She's busy tonight. - I'll call you tomorrow. - I'm busy tomorrow. - She's busy tomorrow. I heard her. - I'm on strike. - She's on strike. I heard her. - We're occupying Alvina Krause. - She's occupying our dormitory. - What? She's what? - What? You're so low on current events. Name an event, Charlie. Don't you know that everybody knows, we're on strike. So what? - Where have you been? - Rowing. My radio's broken. You, should be sitting in. I just might. I find you politically uninformed. Look, we know that the university is very involved in racism and war. 'So, we're starting a revolution.' The only way to make a revolution is to take the university and recapture it for students and people. Ah, what are we doing? You know, those kids sitting in up at the President's office? Yeah, but sitting in doesn't mean a revolution. Yeah, but it's growing fast. I mean, the university took away the school and the playground from the little black kids, right? Right. 'And they're gonna use that for an ROTC headquarters.' We're not out to destroy it. We're only out to make what is ours, ours for all time. The worst thing is that the President is calling the city.. I don't believe this. I feel like the story lady. Now, listen, children. 'City cops are gonna bust the children that are sitting in.' The corporate interest who control the university who's probably calling the Governor because they got very scared of what's happening down here they're calling for militia. We're trying to get everybody to sit in so they'll have to bust the whole school. I'd be up there myself, If I weren't occupying Alvina Krause. You guys should go up there, it's gonna be nifty. 'Oh, hey, Irma.' Thanks. Later. Wonder what this strike will do to rowing practice? What? Wonder what the strike will do to rowing practice? I think it's dumb myself. How many kids will show, do you think? - It's worth taking a look. - Hmm. A lot of kids will show because of that strawberry statement. What? The dean...he said, our telling him, we got an opinion is like telling him we like strawberries. Oh, I love-I love strawberries. Oh, that schmuck. Strawberries? What's he got against strawberries. Must be the color. Hey, let's go over. Oh. I gotta go back to the room. Why? - These pants are too new. - What? - Too new. - Oh, dangerous right? - Over there? - No man, chicks. That place is gonna be crawling with chicks. - These pants are too new. - Okay. I'll see you over there. - I gotta go. - See you at the start. 'Get those legs up! Get 'em up!' Higher! Higher! 'One, two. Common.' - Hey, Simon. - Yeah, George. Did you hear what the pukes did? Took over the President's office, man. Tarzan baby. I think those spades, nasty-ass creeps.. 'Oh, I know. I know.' ...Mafia asses.. ...gonna get this school closed down. My old man's furious with me as if I'm running with pukes. They're gonna get the school closed down. Then what? - 'Huh? Then what?' - What? There'll be nothing, man. Nothing but pukes in this school. I'd beat the shit outta every one of 'em. Now, wait a minute. Oh, they're not all freaks, George. - I mean, I met a girl-- - They're all commie liberals. I'm a liberal. You're a commie too. Move it, girls. Come on, light asses. Go! 'Stroke!' 'Stroke!' 'Stroke!' 'Number one, this isn't fun.' 'Number two, fuck you!' 'Efficient! Row!' Number three, energy. 'Number four, give it more.' 'Number five look alive.' Number six, you suck! 'Number seven..' 'Number twelve, efficient, win, concentrate.' Preach that in your gut pocket you mothers... 'Stroke!' Stroke! Strike for power. 'Stroke!' Strike to prove you're alive. Strike. - Strike because you hate cops. - Strike! Strike because you hate war. Strike to become more human. Strike to return that playground and that park to the kids. Strike, strike, strike. Strike because there is no poetry in your lectures. Strike. Strike because classes are a drag. - Strike. - Strike to make yourself free. - Free. - Strike. Strike to abolish ROTC. ROTC! Strike because there is poverty. Poverty! Strike. Strike to prove yourself alive. Alive. Strike! Strike! Strike! Please deposit what? I don't have 45 cents. No, I don't, uh.. Hey, you know what? I think somebody peed in your telephone booth. Food, food. We want food. Food, food. We want food. Hey, kid, hey. - Let go, let go. - Hey. You really want to get in there? Let's see your ID. - Both of them. - What is this, France? Hey, don't give me any crap, kid. My number's on my badge. You wanna report me? Report me. I give a goddamn, huh. Simon James, that's my name. Bag number's right. You really wanna go in there? You're asking for trouble, kid. - You know what I mean? - No, I don't know. Well, look at these kids. Look at 'em. What do they want from us, huh? They got long dirty hair. They say, they want the niggers to have their playground. And their swimming pool. Terrific. As far as I'm concerned you throw every nigger from the city in the swimming pool. I'm with the kids. - You know what I mean. - Yeah. Niggers shootin heroin, anything they get their hands on. - Not with a K-9 shot. - Yeah. They all shoot stuff. Let's do this thing. I mean, you really are a piece of shit. Food. We want food. Hey, hey, hey. Mm-mm. - Once you're in, you're in. - Once you're in, you're in. 'The blacks threw the white kids out, want their own seating.' 'They want their black continent.' - 'Where did you get the apple?' - 'I gotta save it, sorry.' 'Not gonna stand and howl for food if you got an apple.' 'Yeah, I gotta have something to eat too.' - Your name? - Simon. Can I go in? - Your name's not on-- - I'm not on, I'm not on there. - No, it's not on here. - No. Ah, are you on the food patrol? - What? - Are you on the food patrol? No. You are now on the food patrol. Will someone get the phone? Not you, will somebody else get the phone? - What is that? - Simon what? No, we're sorry. The President will not be in today. The university is under new management. - Food patrol. - 'Goodbye.' - Right here.. - 'Yes, inside, food patrol.' 'I hate to suggest anything repressive' 'to any of you people, but we have very few grams now.' 'I hope you don't all eat them in one large bite.' 'We have no grace.' 'Would someone tell those gourmets out there to shut up?' Let's get the meeting in order. We have a lot to cover. There's a question whether I should be the chairman here 'and whether I shouldn't be chairman of this meeting.' So I guess the only fair way to run this is we should move the question first of all whether or not to have a vote. 'So right now, we're voting' 'about whether or not we're gonna vote.' 'If I win that, I should chair the meeting.' 'Okay? I'll move the question.' 'How many are in favor of taking a vote?' 'Okay, clearly we are gonna vote.' 'Okay. Now, this question is whether or not' 'I should chair the meeting. You can count the vote..' 'Actually, there are ashes in this food.' 'You're eating ashes in your food, stop it.' 'I'm glad we did everything... on the up and up democratically' 'we don't have to worry about that anymore.' 'Okay, the question at hand, the most important one' 'we have a lot of details and everything to take care of.' 'But the most important question is the leaflet' '"Why we strike?" to-to explain to the people' 'on the outside of the building' 'why the people in the building are in the building?' 'I think, that the problem with that is our communication' 'to the public. I think it's a problem of the newspapers.' 'Because they're talking about..' 'They think this whole thing is a lack of communication.' 'That's what they call this-this whole production' whether if we could let them know we know what's going on. You know and what we see stinks and we don't like it. But they think, they just chalk it up to, uh, generation gap a lack of communication. I mean this is our problem. 'That's no accident, the-the people who run the press' and the TV stations, radio and the movies are the same people who run this university. The board of trustees, it's no accident that we get slanted coverage like that. 'They have an interest in it and they can control..' Alright, does anybody know how to fix a Xerox 720? I know. - Who are you? - I do. - What's your name? - Simon. What's your name? - Come on. - Glad to know you. Be careful of the Ming dynasty. Ah, ah, you wanna smash it? - You know where the door is? - Oh, a little humor. Hmm. There used to be a Hieronymus Bosch here. The cleaning ladies took it out this morning. There's nothing wrong with Hieronymus Bosch. Come on, come on. Now, look, I found this.. Hello. Hmm. I found this beyond one of the present books on government. - Sadomasochism. - Oh, no. There aren't any pictures. Presidency did some pretty heavy stuff. The Xerox was working an hour ago. Here it is. Now, there is one file. We need six or seven copies of anything you find about.. ...in the President's Xerox room. Anything you find... about the university and the children center. I'll do what I can. Alright, it was working an hour ago, I don't know. 'You know they may already know that, but..' ...the fact that 50% of the research that's done here depends on defense money. 'The troops are being trained right here on campus.' 'Our university..' '...well, it's producing methods of human oppressions.' 'No. I wanna to get to the news meeting' 'maybe that way we can do something more' 'than just getting it on the leaflet...' 'that'd get it out maybe, maybe they'll get it' 'so that the whole public knows about it.' 'Okay, will you take notes on this so..' 'Okay, this has been brought up that we should bring it' 'to the attention of the public that the university' 'is killing Vietnamese people in a very real direct way.' 'That's all well and good, I mean, there's definitely' 'a point of what we're doing' 'the basic point has to do with racism not war' 'the war itself is a racist thing.' 'I'd like to make an announcement.' - 'Is it really--' - 'It's immediate.' 'It's immediate, more immediate than a pamphlet.' 'Everybody's dropping ashes' ''cause there's only four of us cleaning up..' 'No. I'm serious.' - 'Keep that crap for later.' - 'It's not crap!' 'We are all part of a body of people that is being' 'represented by a college, which is directly servicing' 'big corporations and the war machine' 'and you are sitting there and talking about nonsense.' 'Ashtray.' 'Let's get back to the discussion.' 'What I was trying...was that' 'the university's involvement in a war has been like' 'the main point, I think, of all of the publicities..' '...we've given out.' 'But I think the basic, the most important issue is racism.' 'The people that are most affected by the ROTC building' 'are the black people in this community.' 'Can I say something, can I break in here?' You're very compulsive. Oh, it's you, I saw you, uh, before. What happened to your tooth? Hmm. A girl pushed me down a flight of steps in third grade. - What were you doing? - To her? - Now? - Now. Oh, it was getting into his aftershave. Good thing, president likes fluoride. - I'm Linda. - I'm Simon, what's your name? - I just told you. - Linda, right? I wasn't paying attention, I was looking at your face. I didn't, I wasn't listening. Well, you smell like the president. I'll wash. Uh, then, how long are we gotta stay here? - In the bathroom? - No, in the sitting. Till we get busted, you know, a couple of days, a week.. You're sleeping here? Oh, I got to fix the Xerox. Do you know anything about Xerox? - No. - No? Ah! The plug. - Are you gonna stay in here? - What, in here? Ah-ha. Oh, yeah I guess so, uh.. I got assigned to food when I first got in. - Should've been on Xeroxes. - Well, I'm on food too. We're supposed to sneak out before it gets dark. Hm? Well, I don't wanna sound un-guerilla or anything but I mean, who's gonna give us food? Oh, well, any store, you see, they don't wanna help the cops. We buy their food. They're on our side. Even the liquor store. No grass though. When we get busted, we got to be clean. - Well, I don't smoke anyway. - What are you, speed? Well, actually, I don't, I don't use anything. I used to snort...everything. I got tired of it, you know. I had a couple of bad experiences with acid. 'And I don't need it anymore.' Well, I haven't tried it yet either. No, I mean really, I, carbon monoxide I used to sniff it all the time. Sit outside the tunnels I was a carbon mo-head for three years. - Excuse me. - Oh, shit. I'm Dr. Benton. I-I want to talk to you kids. Hey, does anyone know a Dr. Benton? He just came through the ceiling. Quiet! Mr. Benton from Humanities. Just throw the bastard out the window. He's a killer. Let's watch, he's harmless. Speed freak. Where do you get a dumb name like that? A part of the fabric of our society. Cool it, Watt. Good. - What's your name? - Benton. How did you get in here? This is students only. I climbed there through the hole in the ceiling. - Oh, clever you. - I jog. I hate your face. Shut up, punk, or you'll go out the window. What do you want, Dr. Benton? 'Listen, you don't know what's going on.' 'It's getting bizarre.' The goddamn radio's just announced that there are mawmaws in here. I don't see any mawmaws. The cops are coming in here, I just came from a meeting. You know the cops. Now, you've gotta do something. Food patrol, go! 'What you're doing, the food patrol is not doing?' Now, that would be too liberal. We're doing, Dr. Benton, we are not moving until they give that 'playground and that recreation center back to the kids.' Right. Well, now that the mawmaws are in here we are gonna need more orange juice. 'Little like mission impossible.' - 'Are you serious about this?' - 'No.' 'Simon, I'm talking about the strike.' 'Oh, I thought you meant the ladder.' 'This university is directly involved in the war, Simon.' I know, this chanting gives me a headache. Food. Food. Food. I see some fraternity boys. 'There are some pigs with balloons and more frat boys.' And...tread softly. Frank, get their asses. Get their asses. Get out of the way. - Hi. - Hello. - We want some groceries. - Okay. We are part of the strike over at Western. Please, I don't want no trouble, uh, I mean.. I mean, I-I just don't want no trouble. Will you please put down your hands? And my mother is very sick, she's very sick. You see those eggs? They just came in, fresh. Take anything you want. Go over to the freezer. You'll find a lot of nice things, shrimp, blueberry. Take whatever it is you want. Just take anything you want. Mister, you're sick. I don't have a gun. You like oatmeal? I got all kinds of oatmeal. You just help yourself. Take another peanut butter, those are stale, take the other. Mister, for Christ's sake, they told us that you'd give us food. I'm in the president's office, they said you'd give us food. If you don't wanna give us food, fine, I'm not gonna force you. Put your hands down. You're making me nervous. Take another bag, what'll you do with one bag? Also there's a cart over there, help yourself. It's okay, take anything you want. - It's okay? - Sure, it's okay. I just don't want no trouble. - Neither do I. - 'Good.' 'You take anything you want, leave me out, I'm an old man.' Look, put your hands down and talk to me. - I can't. - Why not? Don't be stupid. What did I do wrong? - Look, you want the groceries? - I'm losing my mind. - I got to get robbed. - Robbed? Yeah, robbed, I gotta get robbed. - I'm not going to rob you. - You gotta, you gotta rob me. Why? My insurance. See? See, right? You got it, right? - Yeah. - That's terrific. Good, very good. Take whatever you want, it's okay. 'Take the expensive stuff. Patties, right over there.' And sesame seed crackers I mean what's pattie without sesame seed crackers, right? Here, lot of donuts, lot of muffins over here. See? Don't forget the sausage. I got sausage up here. 'And all the cheese. These are nice cheeses.' 'Let's see what you got there, you got some squash' you got lettuce, radishes, you can make a nice salad. Cucumbers, don't forget the cucumbers. Thank you very much. We really appreciate this. - Ah, it's my pleasure. - Really, thank you. No mention. She's very pretty, your girl. Police, robbery! Police! Police! Shh! - You alright? - Yes. Keep up with me, baby. I'm gonna to be killed to death. Oh, hey. Hey, mister, you want to curb your dog. I mean, jeez. Funny, right? Yeah. 'You going with someone?' 'Yes.' - Serious? - W-well, yes. - At Western? - No. Could you at least help me steer this? I am. Well, anybody for an extra revolutionary relationship? Hey, I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah! Shh. Squat jumps. 'Okay. Now, get 'em down there, I wanna see bruised asses!' 'Lower!' 'Lower!' Hey. Can you shut up about something? You've got crabs? - You got a girl pregnant? - Mmm. - That'd be nice. - A local chick? Yeah. That's not everything. Oh, yeah? I slept with her in the president's office last night. - No shit! - Yeah. Well, I didn't like, you know.. There were other people there. Doing what? What the hell are you talking about? The strike. Oh, whoa. Are you in on that? Yeah. - What's it like? - Come on. Well, I got into a mild hassle with a cop. I hit him with my Instamatic Super 8. - No shit. - Yeah. Anyway, I met this chick and slept with her in the office. She's going with this creep or something. Nothing's gonna come out of it. Just a big drag. We're on the same patrol. You're tripping. What are you on? Huh? What are you on? Food. - Food? - Yeah, food. I'm on the food patrol. - Food patrol? - Yeah, I'm on the food patrol. You mean like the beaver patrol? You're hostile. Simon. You can get kicked off of crew in about ten seconds flat. If anybody finds out about this. Yeah, well, I'm not making an announcement. I mean, I'm only telling you quietly. James. Are you two gonna run or knit? Listen, how many chicks are sleeping in that office? Uh, 40, 50 150 tonight probably. That's an awful lotta chicks, man. Maybe 200. What's, uh, the deal? Well, uh, if I tell Linda, I split the crew you know, she'll never talk to me again. I mean, she's really into this thing. - You know what I mean? - Yeah, I can dig that. Well, she's gonna sneak out of the president's office and meet with me at the playground. We're havin' a demonstration there. Hey, it's really gonna be heavy. Look, I'm gonna get into this thing. Okay. Oh, I got it. I'll say that I came to recruit and I'll come back with you. We'll come to practice tomorrow and say we're coming to recruit. Well, I'll try it. There better be some action. What are you doing? I wanna feel, what it feels like to.. ...litter from the back of a paddy wagon. - 'So, how does it feel?' - 'Nice.' Not terrific, not fantastic, but nice. 'I hate this.' I swear to God, I really hate this! Oh, uh, nice. 'Alright, come on. Move along.' They'll fingerprint us. Hey, Charlie, you deranged anarchist! How they hangin'? 'No talkin'.' 'No talking up there.' 'Take a look at this' Man, she bit me. Up against the wall. He's gotta be kidding. Isn't this terrific? It's the third time today, I've been up against this wall. Oh! This is Linda. This is Charlie, my roommate. - I'm a political criminal. - Hi. - If he touches me.. - I'll handle it. I wanna female inspector for my girlfriend. - I know my rights. - What? Ah, I don't want you to touch the lady. Who's touching the lady? You're not gonna touch the lady? Please, we got a busy day. Up against the wall. He said it again. Okay, each can make three telephone calls. Local, we pay for. Out of town, reverse the charges. Don't make a big deal. We just want names. There'll be no bail or charges for first offenders. After you make your calls, wait.. ...quietly. I've placed mine already. I called Joyce. She impresses easy. Alright, I'm calling my mother. Why? Maybe, I'm being sentimental, Simon. But this is my first bust. Who called Joyce at 6661940? - That's me! - No, that's me! Hey, wait a minute. That's me. Dad, what do you mean, Simon who? Yeah, good. How's mom? Good. Got arrested. Yeah. Jail. Well, yes. Yeah, uh.. Well, if my hair has been growing for two months I mean, it's got to be longer, right? Well, some people have bad associations when they see long hair. And some happen when they see long Cadillacs. 'Oh, I solved my identity crisis.' 'Yeah. Hey, let me.. I'll call you later, okay?' 'Bye-bye.' 'You're not really serious about this.' 'I am too.' 'Your university is burning babies, killing men.' 'And you're on the rowing team.' 'Rowing crew.' 'Linda..' It's a waste. This strike is part of something real. That's better than being a rowing jock. Now, look, most of the guys on the crew aren't jocks. I mean, our crew doesn't even have as many wasps as it should have according to the population percentage of wasps in the nation. Maybe it should be shut down. Now, look, I mean they have moustaches and everything. Simon, if you want to row a boat, row a boat. Look, you don't understand what it's like, I mean, it's.. - It's erotic. - Oh. I mean, you should try it. I mean, it's a commitment. - It's real. - It's not real. It's a game. The movement is real. - Linda. - What? I am so incredibly confused. So am I. I don't want to blow up any buildings. I know. I mean, I slaved my ass off to get in this school. I.. I didn't get in until late August. I wrote a letter, uh, somebody dug it I got an interview and I got in, and I went insane. I was so happy, I was jumping up and down. I was so glad to get in this school. Simon, nobody's blowing up buildings. Yeah, well, that will come. That's next, see. What the hell? That's what I'm saying. 'Uh, I'd like to blow some of this school' 'right off the face of the Earth.' I wanna mean something. I mean, I'm really gonna hate myself if I just sit back and watch all this. I mean this university stinks. This whole country is getting dumb! Dumb and.. I mean, this country used to have a dream about, uh things being different, you know. And now, everybody's just content to sit back on their asses and leave things just the way they are. I don't know, maybe, they should dream again. I don't know. I'm only 20, so I'll give the country one more chance. Just one. 'Hey, uh, I only have 43 cents' 'not counting my Indian Head nickels.' I'm not gonna buy it. Alright, come on. Oh, no! Okay, you get ready. Earphones. - Don't! - You creep. - Hey, is it loud enough? - What? - Is it loud enough? - 'Yes, it's loud enough.' Do you like it? I'm leaving now. Come on. Listen, I thought we were friends. I really thought you're involved in the movement. 'I didn't know, I think that's what did it.' Well, tell me what to do, I'll throw a bomb. You really don't understand, do you, Simon? It's like cheating for me to be with you. I.. I really think I could marry my man and be his wife forever. Really a bourgeois thing isn't it? Yes, it is. You don't want an uptight chick like me. Yes I do. I really do. If I were going with you, you wouldn't want me to go out with someone like you. That's a very complicated idea. I have to find out for myself, I'm vulnerable, you know that. You could probably talk me into seeing you. Maybe even sleeping with you. But I'd hate you for it. You're very unhappy. Yes, I'm very unhappy. I have to get the bus at 11:30. The bus? I hate this whole night. Goodbye, Simon. Goodbye. Thanks. RFK might have made a good President, but we'll never know. 'ROTC condones violence. It promotes violence.' It even rewards violence and you don't have to be a revolutionary to know that, that's wrong. You're goddamned right and we're fighting this institution today to sever.. They can bring all the guns they have at their fascist disposal.. Act must be taken seriously and cannot be passed off as platonic.. ...is to get the liberation schools going. Need the faculty to really care to talk about the.. 'The very famous quote' "Destroy villages in order to save 'em".. Fuck the CIA.. Five hundred dollars.. FBI. RFK. TNT.. 'We're not moving until they give' 'that playground back to the kids and forget about the ROTC.' 'Ready, ready all.' 'Row!' You didn't feel good yesterday? You had the flu? I felt good yesterday. You seemed down. No, I was up yesterday. I was down Tuesday. No, yesterday you seemed kinda slow. Slow? Hmm, groggy. - Which was it? - Hmm? Groggy or slow? Well, you seemed a little down at the finish. When I get groggy, I'll send you a letter. - Okay? - Okay. It's cool, George. 'I've seen calms and doldrums' 'but not one like this in 40 years.' They're worn out trying to pull us in the wind. Not the way they're pulling. Call 'em in and put.. I've never seen such a piece of crap in my life. You're sitting on my big toe. Television. Goddamn society. It's sick. Sick. Talk about sick, I'll never forget a-a button vendor, outside a funeral at St. Patrick's in New York. Screaming, "Remember, Bobby, 50 cents." 'This movie is a giant bummer.' We're on page three. Yesterday we were on page five. TV coverage is lousy. The television reception is lousy. 'Asshole.' What's sick! Well, just take a little nap. What if the Paris Commune was this dull? Here it is. Here's the proof, babies. 'Oh, boy.' Vitamin E found something. The whole thing was a tax dodge. What whole thing, what is this? The ROTC thing. Taking over the old playground in the children center. Listen, our wonderful university has made a deal with the water and power companies. See, we hold the land tax free until the water and power company's ready to build a new high-rise. And then the ROTC building comes down and Western Pacific is holding the land so, goddamn water and power saves breath. University is servicing the corporation? Yeah, yeah, all of it. More than that, the chairman of the board of directors of the water and power company is also a trustee of Western Pacific. Are you positive? That's capitalism. What's a little money between friends, huh? "Remember Bobby 50 cents". Look, enough, George. I'm not in a mood. You're a freak. You're a jock. Well, let's have a war. Freak against a jock. Don't be stupid, George. Just leave me alone, alright. 'Nothing personal.' I just don't dig your politics, man. Hmm. Oh. Oh, God. Shit. Oh, that's bad. God, that's bad. Oh, that's good. Hey. Oh, God. Now, that's good. White man speak with...fucked lip. 'Simon, oh, my God!' You look fabulous, did-did you see your mouth? Oh, well, did-did it hurt? I know who did it. Pigs beat you. Pigs got a run? - Don't make any noise. - No. Come on, come on, come on. I'm wanna show you to somebody. - No, not a doctor. - Come on, shut up. Come on. My God! If pigs beat on Simon, they'd beat on anybody. 'I'm sick of your whining and stalling.' 'Why can't you do anything we ask, when we want it done, huh?' - I got kids. - 'Great.' A hostage. Cops got him. Look at his lip. - Pigs got him. - What's with the hostage? - What hostage? - Me? Are we gonna.. Are we gonna torture him? - Who is that kid? - What did I say? We're not gonna hurt anybody. You crazy or something? No, well, I heard him say he had kids. He's a college professor on tenure. 'If they found out he's helping, he's gonna be on the street.' Sir, we really appreciate this. You were beaten by the police? Pigs, a raft of them. Did you get any in? - Yeah, I got a few. - It's not enough. - The war is hell, man. - We'll get a camera. A picture. Nice meeting you guys. See you later. I don't know what impression this is gonna make on TV. Wait a second. Thank you very much. Who's this babe? - A gun. - A gun? A what? Lucas. Right here, this is fine. Very heavy in Makalu commune. - Right there. - Gun. Don't move. A big deal in the whole, whole Afro thing. Oh, a gun. Wanna make sure we see some blood. Alright. Don't talk. Okay, I gotta go, I'll see you later. Hey, baby, did I get into it? I joined the movement. Movement? What are you on prunes now, George? I stopped by there, this morning. You weren't there. Should be a terrific burst, huh? What are you living out you're father's dirty sexual fantasies? Now, you're gonna be a commie, so your old man's nightmares can come true? Sure. Bullshit, George. Listen. Why don't you join the army. Go kill some babies. What's your beef with me? Everybody's joined. Yeah, well, everybody didn't punch me in the mouth. Look at that. Sorry. You're putting me on. - I joined. - You're a revolutionary now? Feel different? I'm with you, okay? I'm gonna cry, Simon. What happened? I'm back. Thank God. You really don't care, do you? No, not really. Anybody else would hassle me forever. I ever tell you about my uncle? He killed himself. Anyway, he had a parrot. And he taught the parrot how to say, kiss off. And the parrot picked it right up. 'Used to say, kiss off all the time.' 'And my aunt really hated it.' 'She used to keep a brown paper bag over the cage all the time.' 'And every time she'd lift it up, the bird would be saying' 'kiss off.' Shh. So, she kept the bag over him and finally the parrot didn't have much luck expressing himself so he just dropped dead. And about seven years later my uncle started to look like this bird, you know and he was standing on top of this fantastic bridge and this guard came up to him, and says, "What are you doing you can't stand here." And my uncle said, uh, "kiss off." - What happened? - He jumped. Okay, smile, good. Uh, tiger, you know. Tigress, okay? 'That's it. Back, back over, in the side.' Okay, now, go up against the tree. - 'Okay, that's good.' - I'm going to watch you. - It's fine, right. - We came to war. Yes? - Okay, down, down. - 'Down.' That's it, that's it. Now, the-the Madonna look.. - Mado.. - Yeah. - Oka-ay, line! - No! - Come on, line! - A-ah! Now, that I wear Keds sneakers, I get laid every three minutes. Uh-ah! Alright, that's beautiful. You know, you have a very dirty mouth? - I do? - Mm-hm. - What's the matter? - Classic paranoid. Don't look now, but five paranoids have just joined us. Hi! We are in big trouble. - What are we going to do? - Well, you run like hell. - I'm not leaving you. - They're not gonna rape me. My mother told me if I ever got in a situation like this not-not to fight 'em. Where's your mother now that we need her? Hi! Anything you want? - I think I know what they want. - 'Hate this whole day.' - 'What?' - 'I hate this whole day.' 'Now, look, let's just pretend nothing happened, alright?' Oh, good thinking. That'll really scare the shit outta 'em. Why aren't they talking? Buzz. Instamatic. Man, be cool. 'Look, don't talk to me about violence.' I know you're in this thing but just don't fucking talk to me about violence. 'Come on, you-you're freaking on us.' 'Look, I'm as clear as I've ever been. I'm absolutely lucid.' You make a commitment, strike, you march through the garbage with your magic-marker band of damned bomb sign your lily white hands and nobody gives a shit. I mean nobody cares. From the President down to the local studs. - Hey, here, listen to me. - Oh, listen? Tell, tell 'em. We sort of got into this thing at the park. Something. I mean, they laid my camera out on the ground. - Oh, man. - Well, that's not the point. The point is you try to do something and nobody cares. I mean, what kind of bullshit city is this, in a bullshit country with the bullshit cops beating up on the demonstrators and the protestors, the real peace makers when they should be beating up on the war makers and the haters and the killers? Oh, it's bullshit, man! - It's bullshit. - What? Wait. Bullshit! Bullshit! - I'm sorry. - It's alright. George is really compulsive. I've never seen such notes. Come on, let's go back to the city. Simon, anybody who doesn't take the exam gets suspended. Geology. Simon, how do you identify wolframite? A-ah, it has a thin scar running down its cheek. - Simon. - Ouch! I'm tired. - Orpiment. - Orpiment! Orpiment is on the page next to realgar and it's ye-yellow. - Shh! - What's the matter? It's my mother. Don't answer. Shh! She'll come and see us...here. Just.. Yello? Swatch. Hi. What? 'Where is he? Yeah, I'll go right over.' - 'Terrific traction.' - Oh, my Geology notes. Terrific. There's another little traction and...this really hurts, man. Right under the blanket. Goddamn! What happened? Oh, jocks, man. About 600 of 'em. I really got kneed. If the pigs didn't come along I'd really be pregnant. What did the pigs do? Did you know that jocks were perverts, man? Hey, what did the pigs do? They watched. They put a little rum, you know. 'Took a shot, nice guys.' - How do you feel now? - Shitty. Jesus jumping Christ. It's gone too far. I mean, this is over our heads. Sons of bitches. They called my old man. He's flying in here tonight. This is absurd. Ah! Dammit! Wanna sign my cast? 'Strike! Strike! Strike!' 'Strike because your roommate was clubbed..' - The Dean. Is he around? - Do you have an app-- Is he in? Is that his office? - He's not in. - Mm-hm? 'Alright, where did you put him?' 'Your name?' 1-9-2-3-3-0. Student. - You know what you have here? - Where? George's leg is broken and I know you don't give a shit. But it's your fault and he's my friend. 'Now, I gotta tell you something, lady.' 'There are plenty of other legs and arms around here to break.' 'Plenty.' 'Unless this school gives the building and the playground' 'back to the neighborhood.' Unless this school gives some room to some jet black faces around here, unless this school gives up it's war research program, unless this school gives up the fucking 19th century and calls off the pigs, it's gonna be all over. Now, you've been hearing about revolution, right? 'You've been watching it on the television.' 'Reading it in the newspapers. It's not there, it's here.' - Here. - Here. In every room. In every toilet of this idiot school there's a, there's a.. I'm sorry. There is a.. There is a kid waiting for tonight. And unless you call off the pigs, it's gonna be a mess. 'And war' and not because there has to be but because you started it. 'Hey, did you see the news rails of Prague?' 'This looks just like it.' I know who they are. Who are these guys? - They're the jocks. - Jocks anti-strike.. Oh, I see. - You gotta get Auri on it. - Al? So fantastic that the black Simmons has joined this year. I'm really moved. He can't suspend the whole school, he's not that dumb. No, he's pretty dumb. 'This is ten times better than anybody expected.' - 'Fantastic crowd.' - 'The press is finally here.' Yeah, you remember Lucas? This is the cat that got bloodied. Yeah. Yeah, I remember. - The press is scared shit. - Not you? Now, you don't think CBS, NBC are out here for the practice. 'We are opinion makers, baby.' No, we've gotta have the kick. You understand? You gotta fix it now. Find out what's wrong with it. - Hey, lady, get off the cable. - I don't know. - 'Get off the cable!' - 'You're the expert.' Look at the size of his stick. There's something happening here. We've a lady on the cable. 'I don't know. Lady, get off the cable.' - Get off the cable, lady. - 'Just not learning it enough.' - I think they're learning. - Isn't that too much? - We did as much as them. - No, we didn't. 'Teachers and classes? Sure. Lots of things in common.' - Worse. - Yeah, like what? - Well, like over population. - Oh, right. Ecology. - That's what it is. - That's the answer. Students, quite, please. What's gonna happen? They're gonna close the Laundromat. Students, this is your president. 'If you do not remove yourself full swing.' 'The University will make a complaint' 'to the police department in connection with your activity.' 'You will face fraughtful arrest' and suspension from the University. 'You will be..' - Robbed. - Raped. ...laws of this state. - 'You willbe..' - Drafted. Drafted, murdered, buried, reborn as politicians. 'At this University.' The president has just given them an ultimatum. This is news. Al, do you understand? This is headline time. Something's gonna happen. Somebody's either coming out of the building or somebody's gonna go in that building. But nothing's working. We can't...we're impotent. We're sitting here impotent. It's been dry an hour ago. Boy, this coffee tastes like shit. - You want this? - Yuck. I want a beer so bad, that I could taste it. Hi, good to see you guys here, huh. You want to see some blood tonight? If there's blood, I hope it's a day of massive casualties. Because I don't want to be part of light to moderate casualties. I can dig it. - Are you scared? - 'Strike t-shirts.' Well, not while I'm behind this fence. 'Get your strike t-shirts.' He left, he left. He left me standing here. - Who? - Al! If they didn't bust tonight, there'll be a food problem. No, the momentum is right. The National Guard just got here. Let's go. Alright, positions. Get those tables back. C'mon, everybody. To our positions, let's get it. C'mon, c'mon. C'mon, quickly, quickly. Fall in positions. 'We've been informed that the police department' 'and National Guard..' 'Will take all necessary action' 'in connection with our complaint against you.' 'If you do not remove yourself from this area' 'within the next five minutes.' I implore you. Leave now. How come we weren't doing all this stuff? We didn't know. Everybody down. Everybody down Keep down. Keep down. Go, go, go, go. Come on, go. Get down. What are you? Pigs! Ah! You motherfuckers! No! Please. Don't hurt him!
