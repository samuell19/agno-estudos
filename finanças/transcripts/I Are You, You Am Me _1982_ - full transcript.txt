Ah, the scenery of Onomichi. Quite beautiful, now that I think about it. But you gotta go to school, Kazuo. Okay. Kazuo! Hurry up! Wait up! I'm coming! What took you so long? She's looking. Watch out! She used to be very sick. That's why she's older than us. So she's had her period already? Dumbass. All chicks get it. She's coming! Run! Impotent? Really? Yeah, after a fall like that, it'll last your whole life. You mean, like a homo? Yeah. You can make money that way. Shut up! I'm still a virgin! How can I be a homo? I'm a man! All rise! Bow! Good morning. Sit down! We have a new student today. Kazumi Saito. Her father was transferred here from Kobe. But she was born here in Onomichi. Hey Kazuo, sounds like your name! Kazuo Saito! Are you related? Or married? Kazuo? It's you! I can still remember! You're that Kazuo! Remember? You wet the bed when you stayed over! We went to the same class together! That wasn't me! Of course it was. Be quiet! Are you sure it's him? Anyway, we'll all be nice to our new classmate. Won't we? Yes, we'll be very sweet to her. Won't we, bed-wetter Kazuo? Kazuo? Kazuo... What the...? It's you! Sorry. Are you mad? I was so surprised to see you. I don't know you. You have amnesia? Well I remember it all perfectly. That time when you woke up and ate cat food. Or when you wet the bed and I lent you my panties, but they didn't have a fly, so you couldn't find your weiner! You idiot! Shut up! Oh no! Kazuo! Wait! Let go of me! Hey, don't you have three moles on your butt? Cut it out! Don't be like that. Why don't you just admit it? Didn't the teacher say, “be nice to your new classmate?“ New classmates are supposed to be shy. So why aren't you? Because we're old friends. I've kept your secret to this very day. What secret? That you killed Grandma. We're home from kindergarten! There? a fly on Grandma? mouth! Hey, you wanna come over? It's still the same house as back then. Are you kidding? Hanging out with a chick? Get lost. Maybe I'll go to your place then. Shut up! Come on... Well, I'll come anyway. I knew you were Kazuo! “I knew you were Kazuo!“ Based on a novel by Hisashi YAMANAKA TENKOSEI (TRANSFER STUDENT) Executive Producer: Shiro SASAKI Produced by Michio MORIOKA, Kyoko OBAYASHI, Yoshiyuki TAGA Screenplay by Wataru KENMOTSU Cinematography: Yoshitaka SAKAMOTO Art Director: Kazuo SATSUYA CAST: Toshinori OMI as Kazuo Saito Satomi KOBAYASHI as Kazumi Saito Makoto SATO Wakaba IRIE Kirin KIKI Jo SHISHIDO Etsuko SHIHOMI as Miss Ono Directed by Nobuhiko OBAYASHI Watch out! Is that you? So hot... It's gone! Where are you going? Idiot! Stop whining! It's... it's me? It's me! Cut it out! Kazumi, stop it! Oh, how have you been, Ma'am? You've hardly changed at all! Not like my mom... That's no way to act! Kazumi, your mom is pretty rough. - You're still acting... - Stop it already! - Bye! - Come back here! I said come back here! Come back right now, Kazumi! Where are you going? Is she coming? Well, shit. Hey Kazuo, what are we supposed to do? How should I know? Anyway, we've been switched somehow. Hey, stop crying. Nobody knows about it yet. On the outside, it looks like I'm still me, and you're still you. My mom said to me: “Hurry up and go home!“ Of course. For the time being, I'll be you, and you'll be me. But I can't! Get on. Not like that. Grab on to me. That hurts! My nipples are sore. Hold on lower. Pervert! Did you touch 'em? Of course I did. They're mine now. If you want 'em back, give me back my dick. Pervert! Idiot! Whatever, hold on! Hey! You two... Well, there it is. You'll have to sleep at my house tonight. I don't want to! I can't do it. We don't have a choice. Kazuo, where have you been? Mom, look... I'm Kazuo. And this is the new student Kazumi Saito. Same one from back then. Oh, you're that Kazumi. No, she's Kazumi and I'm Kazuo. Quit joking around. Your dad is waiting for you. What's wrong? Kazuo? No! That's Kazumi! You go home now. What's with you? Hurry and get inside. Uh, hello? I'm home. I'm home. Where have you been hiding? You're no help at all! Go to the dining room, right now. Hurry! Look at your clothes! Dirty like a boy! What was that just now? Huh? A bow. A bow to your own brothers? Bad conscience, huh? Mom told us. You were acting like a boy earlier. Moving to a new place is a big change, but don't make Mom worry. Dad is working late. Let's start without him. Sit down. Hey, can't you eat like a girl? I'm glad you're eating mushrooms and not talking, but you have to watch your manners. Don't slurp so loud. Could you get that? Hello? Hi Kazuo. It's me, Kazumi. Yeah, I recognize my voice. How is it going? Doesn't suck that much. Don't talk like that! Well you talk like a fag. I'm a... I mean, you're a man. Don't forget. I know. How's it going over there? Alright, I guess. Can't you stop talking like a girl? It's creepy. Oh, Kazuo... What? I can't do it. Do what? Sometimes, it gets bigger. What? Where pee comes out... Idiot! Don't play around with it. But I had to wipe it clean after using the toilet. There's no need to. You just have to shake it a couple times. That's all. You got that? Got it. But you have to wipe it clean. I know that. Kazuo, dinnertime. I have to go. Your mother's calling. Let's eat. Feeling alright, Kazuo? He's acting weird today. A stomach-ache? You have been going to the toilet a lot today. Does it hurt somewhere? Have you fallen for that Kazumi Saito? Kazumi Saito? She's back. Here you go... Go on, Dear... Well, Kazuo... My work got accepted... We'll be moving to Yokohama. I got promoted. I'll be working at the main office there. Let's have a toast. To a lot of success in the future. Congratulations. You too, Kazuo. Congratulations. - Hey Bro... - What? Do you believe... Believe what? Do you believe that a man and a woman could switch bodies? What nonsense are you thinking about? Cut it out, Kazumi. That's not for girls. Chicks don't have any fantasy. Look at the way you're sitting! Time for bed. Say goodnight to Grandma. Over here. Promise her you'll be good. Pray for her. I have to sleep here? What are you talking about? Your room is next to the entrance. Have you forgotten already? Go on, pray. Kazuo, go to bed. We can start packing tomorrow. There's no time to play. A girl's bag? Who's this from? Give it back tomorrow. Go to bed! Cleaned up well. Look at you, all messy again! Put on your nightie. I sewed this on. Now go to sleep. Night. It's me... What are you doing there? My bag. Here's yours. Thanks. Come in. Not wearing a bra? Don't look! Close your eyes. Quit your blabbering. What? Take off the blouse. Put your arms through. Do it more gently! What is it now? I have bad news. You guys are moving. Another school, again. What? I... I mean, you'll be moving? Did you change your panties? You gotta change them every day! Here. Don't stare like that! I wanna die. Don't be stupid! You can't die! You have my body, so you have to take care of it. And you take care of mine. Even so... We gotta do something. Oh, no! Mom will be back soon. Yeah? Then you better leave quickly. Don't take long. - And brush your hair! - Sure. Bye. Kazuo! Why are you late? Kitchen duty. Did it go well? Does it hurt? No, but... I feel terrible. I'm even worse! Hey, don't start crying. Kazuo Saito may not be a big hero, but he's no sissy either. So pull yourself together! - Yes, but... - Don't touch me. Let's split up for now. So we won't be seen like this. Kazuo! Walk more like a girl. Kazuo! What's going to happen with us? Don't touch me. Where's my dad transferring? Yokohama. So Dad's dream came true. Oh well. Maybe everything will go back to normal today. So don't worry. Why did I end up with you again? You've always been nothing but trouble. Shut your mouth already! So have you felt her up yet? Pervert! What? You horny pig! I'll kill you! Yesterday, you didn't say anything. Kazuo, are you on her side? Even though she talked shit behind your back? What? Stop it! Kazumi! Girls don't do things like that! Kazuo! Liar! You pulled up my skirt! Stop talking like that! Anyway, that's no reason to fight. So he pulled up your skirt. That's no reason for you to get involved, Kazuo. Kazumi, you surprise me. A girl so wild. “Without love, people are hopeless.“ “When people cease loving themselves, they also stop loving others,“ “and hope is lost from the world.“ Well done. Kazuo, you read really well today. Kazuo! Let's go! This crab is not the kind you eat. More like a helmet. Don't kill them. Females are like this, and males like that. The opposite of humans, right? They're under animal protection. But sometimes, people take from others. Some people commit crimes, and some break the law. - Hey, Kazuo... - What? Pay attention, you two! What now? Liar! When will we be normal again? I can't talk about it here... Please, I have to talk to you privately. Impossible! Move aside, idiots! Kazuo... Your family will move during summer vacation. Think of the consequences. What will we do? - Saito! - Yes? No, I meant Kazumi Saito. Kazuo, your problem was already done well. The next problem is for Kazumi. People say you're very good at math. Well then... Good luck. What? Can't solve it? What's wrong? Why can't you solve something so easy? Idiot! Shut up! I hate math! Hey, Wait! Kazumi! I can't take it anymore! Sorry. Don't get mad. No! I hate this body! I hate Kazuo Saito too! It's the same for me! The only thing I want is to be able to piss standing up again! I'll kill myself! - What was that for? - It's your fault! Hey, you two! Stop right now! What is it? Asshole! Stop right there! Why is this open? Ouch! Ouch! I'm the principal! Miss Ono! What is the meaning of this? That was close. What would I do if it was more than just bruises? Stop, it still hurts. After all, it is my face. You should take better care of it. I know. Kazumi should be more feminine and charming. How am I supposed to get married like that? Have you been changing panties every day? The day before yesterday. Oh, my body. What are you two up to? You're pretty small, but you got a nice figure... Why don't you come with me? Help! Somebody help! Get outta here, you sissy! Come on, let's go. Let go of me, you ass! Don't play hard to get! Stop it! Let's get out of here! Can't breathe... Spread your legs. Hurry. It's fine. Better now? Jump up and down. - Better? - A little. Let's go then. Stop crying already. You have to be patient. Don't worry. It's gonna be alright. Besides, today was fun. You're back already? What is it? What happened to your face? A fight with some greaser. What did he do to you? He came on to me. Then what? Kazuo saved me. That Kazuo? Yeah, he's really strong. He beat that greaser up. First he kicked him in the balls. Then gave him a right hook. Unbelievable, that Kazuo... He really saved me. What a good boy. You have so many bruises... It's fine. But you can't go like this. Go where? To Grandma's memorial service, of course! Ah, right. A WOMAN'S BODY How did Grandma die? Heart attack. Didn't she die another way? What do you mean? Like from insecticide. What are you talking about? She was sleeping in this chair right here, right? She was already dead then. I called the doctor. What? That lying little... What did you say? Oh, nothing at all. You're acting strange. You'll stay home tomorrow, okay? If the relatives were to see you like this... Okay! Hello? Kazuo? Ah, there you are. Thanks for calling. Anyone here? They're at the memorial service. For Grandma who died of a heart attack. Come in. It's your house after all. Sit down. Want one? Mom made these? What's wrong? When I was a kid and we went on trips, Mom used to make these for me. What are you doing with that? I tried it on. But it was way too small. - It really hurt! - Dummy! You have to tell Mom. Oh, you'll need new swim trunks too. New swim trunks? For the school trip. Yes, please. You've grown, huh? Everything becomes too small too fast. Kazuo, why not just get a towel and wrap it around? Then size won't matter. - You shouldn't have. - No big deal. You're too young for that one. Pick something cuter. How about this? Here. You shouldn't have... Uh, thanks. What's with you treating me like a stranger? Maybe it's your age... That's fine. You'll be prettier than me. A wonderful young lady, no doubt. You'll find a nice man, and get married. I have to go to the bathroom. Kazumi, your skirt is on backwards. One more. Huh? Whaddaya want? Don't eat too much or you'll get fat. Dummy. You're pissing me off. I know that. - Saito! - Yeah? I mean Kazuo... This will be your last trip with us, won't it? Take a good look at the scenery. Remember it when you're at school in Yokohama. Look how beautiful it is. Sing along! Kazuo, what's wrong? Enjoy yourself. This is gonna be fun. Watch out! You idiot! Oh, I forgot the top! Kazuo! Come with us! No, stop it! Help! Help! You Okay? You Okay? Can't he swim? No, he can't swim! You ass! Don't fight! Don't fight! Stop it! Stop it! I've only had two plates. I'll swim it off tomorrow. Don't forget the sunblock. Kazuo, hurry up. Kazuo, come in. Ah, sorry. Sleep well? No. Me too. Chicks really stink. Hey... Any changes in your body? Just a little sunburn. No, I mean... Down there... below your stomach... Any pain at all? Speak more clearly. Well... Listen closely... Um... My period will come soon. Period? Once a month, women have... Oh, that. You know about it? A little. Pervert! They taught us about it in school. No need to worry, but it's your first one. I'm already used to it. But you aren't, so I'm worried. Me? I'll have a period? Don't let them notice it! What should I do? Use these. The instructions are inside. Okay? I'll try. This sucks... Saito! - Kazuo Saito! - Here! Kazumi Saito! She's absent? You're missing school just because of your period? Easy for you to say. It's just a sign that you're healthy. Let it be, but don't let it show. But it's the first time. First time? I mean, the first time taking a day off. Hey Kazuo! What's wrong with you lately? You're acting like a fag. You and Kazumi. What's wrong with you two? Spit it out! I wanna know. Kazuo, you have a dick right? So you can fight. Or are you not a man? Guess we'll have to check. Stop it! Stop it! - Kawahara? - What? Is Kazuo absent again? For three days. Wonder if he's sick... Kazumi? I gotta tell you something funny. It's better if you leave Kazuo alone. What for? He's good for nothing. What's that supposed to mean? He can't piss standing up. He has to sit down. Oh yeah? So then... We had to investigate whether he really had a dick. Very thoroughly. We undressed him, and saw his tiny sausage. Then he cried like a girl! What a pussy! What was that for? Do you know what you've done? All of you ganging up on him. You cowardly pig! Haven't you thought of the consequences? Stop it! Tomboy bitch! Why don't you get yourself Kazuo's dick? If only I could! Want me to cut your dick off instead, asshole? He really deserved it. He's always being mean to us. But Kazumi taught him a lesson! We've always wanted to get back at him. Although, you went a bit too far. You know that, right? Kazumi, you want to visit me sometime? At your place? How about this Sunday? Please? I have to talk to you. Oh, Kazumi? Is Kazuo there? Ya know, ever since you've been here, he's been acting weird. Is he sick? I don't really know. He says stupid stuff all the time. I think it's your fault. He has to go to a new school pretty soon. So leave him alone. That okay? Bye. My fault... Been a long time. Our hometown is the best. Is Kazumi still in her room? Something's wrong with her. Probably puberty. She was once a little girl, but before you know it... She rarely showers. She's grown up, then. On Sunday, she's going to visit her friend Miss Kawahara. I wonder if she'll be better by then. Look! It's great! To Miss Akemi Yoshino Whose birthday? Yours, of course! Have you forgotten already? Ah, right... Do you know what I have in mind? I invited Hiroshi over for your birthday. What? Hiroshi! Aren't you happy? Sure. . . Very happy! You don't look like it at all. You've been acting strange lately. Ever since you've been spending time with Kazuo. I guess... Because Kazuo isn't right for you. So you should stop hanging out with him. Okay? Stand up. Hiroshi is the right one for you. So where is that guy Hiroshi now? What's gotten into you? How can you forget about your dear Hiroshi? I'm just kidding! Um... I don't mean to interfere, but tell me... What's going on between you and Kazuo? Between us? I've known him since elementary school. He might not be very bright, but he's always cheerful and fun. But not anymore. Except for you, he's been avoiding everyone in class. Is there some secret between you two? Secret? I happened to pass by your house a couple of days ago. I saw him standing there crying. He was crying? You know, I'd like to help somehow. I feel so sorry for him. Well... You know... Auntie, fix this! Again, Hiroshi? Hiroshi? Yeah, my nephew. Let me see it. Thank you! Hiroshi? - It's fixed, Mom! - Great! - My sister. - Have a good day. Keiko, don't stay in the sun too long. It's strange. When you fixed that car just now, you seemed a lot like Kazuo. He's good at things like that. You were about to say something... Don't worry about us, just give it time. We have to get over it ourselves. Well, okay. Thank you for today. I feel relieved that Kazuo has such good friends. I see... I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. It'll be fine. Oh, I have a favor to ask. - So? - He's coming. Good, thank you. His mother seemed angry. Sorry for making you do that. Well, I'll go back home. - Thanks again. - It was nothing. Hey, who's this Hiroshi guy? What about him? What is he to you? What do you mean? Stop stalling, I don't have all day. Tell me your relationship with him. None of your business. Come on, spit it out. He's just a classmate. He's good at sports, and really smart. He's in love with Akemi, though. But Akemi doesn't love him. Cut to the point. Do you have a crush on Hiroshi? I can't... I don't want others to know. Idiot, I'm you right now! Oh, I see... Kazumi has a crush on Hiroshi. What about Hiroshi? He's coming, along with Akemi. - Coming? - Yeah. To my... I mean, your birthday. Your mom wants me to get together with him. That's the last thing I needed. - So Hiroshi's coming? - Yeah. What should I do? Don't do anything weird! That's why I asked you. Should I kiss him? No! Of course not! I'll introduce him to my new friend. And that'll be you. Then you can tell me what to do. - I'll be there with Hiroshi? - Yeah. It'll be easier for me too. We'll get this done. Don't worry. You should come back to school. I'm starting to worry. Yes, I'll try. I know how you feel though. It's hard on you. I also feel bad for you. Why? Because of me, they all laugh about you. I just can't handle it. It's alright. Guys don't have to worry about getting married like girls. It's not like I'm a big hero. I'm sorry. Cheer up. Your boyfriend is coming. - Hurry up! - It'll be fine. Not those shoes! Hurry. Alright. Careful. See you later. Bye. It's fine. Take care! You're late! They'll be waiting at the castle at 11! - Oh yeah? - So come on! Hurry! Your boyfriend should be able to wait. He won't wait! Come on! Be girlier! Fine. What should I do when I see Hiroshi? Add “-san“ to his name! We're not that close yet. I understand. I can hardly wait. You're really looking forward to it, huh? He's so cool! But don't jump at him. Or he'll think you're a homo. Kidding! Just kidding! So, how should I do it? Act like you're blushing. Don't smile so weird! Blush! You know how to blush? That's way too repulsive! Hey! Akemi! Where's Hiroshi? He's so pushy. That's why I ran away. He'll join us later. No way! So are you really Kazuo Saito? Yep. I knew it! What the hell are you doing? Cut it out! It's Kazumi's body, no doubt. You some kind of pervert? But on the inside, it's Kazuo. When I got Kazumi's letter, I thought it was a joke on me for liking Sci-Fi. Letter? “I can't take it anymore.“ “I want to die.“ Too well made for a prank. So that's what she wrote you in the letter. But that's our secret. Amazing. It's like a Sci-Fi novel! I'll write a book about it! Is that Hiroshi? Yeah, that's him. Alright. Now I have to play Kazumi. How have you been? You've really grown. Hiroshi has changed as well. Into a horny maniac. What's wrong with you? Why did you hit her? Kazumi... A brat like this is no boyfriend for you. Kazumi... Happy birthday. Now I've had it! Cut it out, you ass! Oh, please forgive my choice of words. Guess I overreacted a little bit. You too, Kazuo. Yes, I'm sorry. You Okay? Does it hurt? Gotta go! Wait! Your present! He's been absent for a week. I wonder what happened. I'm worried about him. “I'll be late tonight. -Mom“ Hi. Kazuo! Eat this. Your mom made it. Sorry about the whole Hiroshi thing. Don't be. It was unavoidable. Is my mother... nice to you? She's really happy about my good grades. It's the opposite with me. She said she would buy anything for me. And what did you say? I said I don't need anything. You idiot. You should have asked for a new camera. Didn't think of it. Look. Eat up. So... What should I do? How can I cheer you up? Tell me if there's anything I can do. I'll do anything you want. It's fine. Don't worry about it. I can't help it. Should I call Hiroshi and make up? No, Hiroshi doesn't mean anything to me anymore. I used to think I was in love with him. But now I know that it was just a childish fantasy. You're not angry anymore? All forgiven. What are your future plans? Why do you ask? Because we'll be moving in a week. And if we stay the way we are, we should think about that. Maybe you'll be an engineer? Or make movies? And what about you? If only I could be me again. But time is running out. I'll probably get used to my life as Kazuo Saito. And that's that. No choice. Kazumi... But... I have a last request. What? To see myself. What do you mean? I want to see my body... naked. Wait a second... Sure, this was your body, but now it's mine. So you don't need to worry about it anymore. No. I want to look at it. One last time. I want to bid farewell... to my body. Let me say goodbye to my body. Show me. Good bye. Kazumi! What are you doing? I'll... I'll run away from home. I'll run away from home! Run away... The last ship will leave shortly. All passengers, please get on board. Hurry! Or you'll miss it! Come on! Drink with us! Here! Wait a second, they can't have that. Here, this is for you. And for you. Have some. Are those kids with you? Kids? Yeah, they're mine. Is it forbidden to have kids or something? Here, have a drink. Have a drink already! Fantastic! Now that's a Japanese woman! What is going on? Aren't you running a business? I'm sorry. Everything's fine. Everything's fine? Why didn't you say so before? You asleep? Tired? Can I come in? I won't do anything. It's the first time I've seen my face like this. Me too. Do I really look like that? I'm hungry. I'll go look for something. Yes, yes. There are two kids. No, a boy and a girl. Around... 14 or 15. They came with a tour group. Yes, a couple. I think it might be a double suicide. I'll keep an eye on them. Please come. Yes... You're welcome. I want to die. I really want to die. Don't say stupid things. You are me, and I'm you. If you really have to die... we'll die together. I want to go home. To my real home, and my real mom. That's not possible. You were gone for a whole night. It would be over then. It's over anyway. Hey, watch out! Watch out! Wait! You know, Kazumi... I know it's hard for you. But when you think about it, it's not so bad after all. As long as we stay together... Right? So don't do anything rash. I'll do my best for you. Oh, wait a second. Gotta take a piss. Don't walk away. I'll... never go home again. There's nowhere for me to go. Kazumi! Hey! Don't die! Pull yourself together! Not without me! Huh? Wait a sec. Our clothes have switched again! Hit me! Hit me! Hit me! Pull yourself together! It hurts... It hurts! So we've switched back again! We switched back! They're... gone! It's back! How about you? It's gone! Kazuo... I love you! I love you more than anything else! I love you too! Alright... I'm gonna piss standing up! Go for it! I'll watch! I want to go home. Me too. See ya. Bye! Kazuo! Hurry up! We're leaving! Once again, thank you very much! He's so slow. I'll be an old lady soon. Kazumi... Kazuo! Let's go! See ya. Kazuo! You look pretty in that dress. You take care. You too! Good bye! Good bye! Good bye! Good bye! Goodbye! Goodbye, me! Goodbye, me! Goodbye, me! Goodbye, me.
