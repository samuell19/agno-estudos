Dien Bien Phu Saturday, March 13, 1954, 17 HOURS On approaches to the camp surrounding Dièn Bien Phu Listen. Two Breton. One - Sgt Algerian infantry. Another - from the Legion. Said that he's a Belgian. But I know that he is a Breton. "Mau-len! Mau-len! "Mau-len" all the time! I'm very tired! I said: "Mau-len", you old bastard! MARCH 13, 1954, 17 hours, HANOI Stay here, you old bastard! His croaking hurts my ears. Excuse me while I check the front page. Who's that? Beatrice Vergne. Premier violinist of the Paris Conservatoire. a great artist! She is touring the South-East Asia. Just arrived from Singapore. Will give a concert with the Municipal Orchestra of the Grand Theater. A cultural event. You are interested in Western music? But you are the enemy of colonialism? You know, Mr. Simpson, our struggle for national independence - This is not resistance to French culture. Just as our thousand-year struggle against China had nothing against Buddhism or Taoism. I love Victor Hugo, French philosophers. And I like to drink red wine. And I spent 5 years in the French courts. But readers do not care, Mr. Vinh. Dien Bien Phu! Where is this fucking place? There it is. They want to know whether this battle will start, and when. Everybody wants to know. You can win a lot of money with a serious bet! Millions of Piastres Maybe I should write an article about it. And where to play? Everywhere. On the street. In the bistro. The bar of your hotel. Ask your trishaw to take you to "Ong cop." Mr Tiger, Chinese. He knows. "Ong cop" - a serious place, like the Bank of Indochina! You too! You play! 17:15 You're in the battalion from the beginning? The mobile unit, temporarily seconded. I was responsible for scouts in the mountains along the Black River. Sitting up there. It was hot. In the background of something - On the border with China. You have no idea! And then, when we retreated, I was stuck in this hole. I am a master of all sorts of things, best left alone. By the way, I think they've forgotten about me. In the evening, I'm waiting for their friends here, to cross the front line. Third call, foreman. What? What foreman? Foreman. that's what they call it in the theatre, When the curtain rises. To warn people, that the play begins. My mom worked in the theater. Yes, but for a long time every night throwing plums and the performance hasn't even begun yet. Dollars I also take! Mr Simpson! I'm taking dollars too, Mr. Simpson! Hong Kong Stock Exchange day rate. How do you know my name? An Englishman, naturalised U.S. citizen in 1946. Correspondent of "The San Francisco Chronicle." Pulitzer Prizewinner Hotel Metropol, number 317. You are a famous man, Mr. Simpson. I can also arrange an excellent poker party for you. Perhaps you are also familiar with how many times I fucked last night? I'm only concerned with business. You're one of my potential customers, Mr. Simpson, I was hoping you'd come. They say you are lucky at cards. And in love. So, this battle? Tonight - 5 to one. Tomorrow, Sunday - only two to one. The French are very respectful of Sundays! They rest. The most appropriate date for the attack. Therefore, the rates lower. - 20 piastres - on tonight. - 100 piastres - for tomorrow. A lot of money at stake today, eh? How much? .. Just curious. To know what the interest is in this battle. Money - is a good criterion. "Keep your lips sealed as jade." "And thought - as a fortress." This is a good Chinese proverb to live a happy and long life! You see, Mr. Simpson, perhaps Giap can win Maybe the French... But what's for sure - I'll win a lot. When it's all over, I'll tell you how many millions were won. And you can tell me how many lives were lost. It will be interesting to compare! MARCH 13, 1954, 17:30. Calling Racoon, calling racoon - come in Chief, chief - radio! - Raccoon listen! - Go back to the base, Mau-len! "Kohler" from "Raccoon," understood. I must return to his position. - Damn! Come with me. I didn't think they'd go that night. although there is a guy? I don't know. Probably leads people who live in the mountains around here. I've orders - I have to wait for them. In any case, here is better than there! Pam-pa-pam-pa pam as before It is not good, too expensive! Fuck off, you clown. I don't have to ask you! You'd better be here when I come out ! Lie down next to me! I'll give you a taste of nectar! 10-year old. Chateau Marqueau! Little Jesus in velvet pants. - Not today! The paper requires an article about Dien Bien Phu. and I don't know what to write You know that Dien Bien Phu was one of the largest opium markets in Indochina? I dealt there myself once upon a time It was a charming place, a little primitive. You don't care, eh? And you're right. It's not because of the opium all those boys are out there. I put 100 piastres on it with Mr. Tigre of "Ong Cop" that the battle will begin tomorrow. Tomorrow, tonight, 8 days... Do not be so impatient! A handsome legionnaire,one of my lovers said: "Profit from the war, ma petite!" Me, like a mother to him! He told me: "Ma petite!" "Profit from the war!" "Because what comes afterwards, will be terrible!" - Do you think that... - I do not think - I know! My opium is not a crystal ball. I can't tell you the hour nor the day but I know what'll happen at Dien Bien Phu! And I know what will come later. Thank God I'm already done for. Whew! Look... A little more smoke. More, more... And then - nothing. Go on, try this miracle! Come on, it can still be fun! 19:50. Strongpoint "Beatrice." Partly captured, still holding out. You can go home I don't need you anymore. And oil the wheels! - Yes, Chief! I'm not a chief, I'm your customer! And the customer is always right! The customer is always right! Brandy and soda, please! No - a brandy and soda! You must drink it, sir! Drink the health of the Legion or suffer - Lay off me! - We are here - among friends! I want a brandy and soda, that's all Brandy and soda, mau-len! Come on, come on, come on! Wow! Howard Simpson! What are you doing here, you old crocodile! Can't be! Vic! Vic! you bastard Look at what these bad boys are making me drink. Oh! Mr. Victor Jegu de Kerveguen! Again the Prussians hole your frame! Beatrice! Beatrice, come here! Meet a Howard Simpson, my old friend! Howard, Beatrice is my cousin! Beatrice Vergne, the pride of the family! Well, now, old chap, you're a big boy drink the white cocktail! That's an order! - But... - Come on, drink, and then something like a club! Drink up, like a good boy and I will let you in the club! The Legion! Well done! Welcome to the club! Gentlemen, the old crocodile - my friend! I know that he's a journalist and an American, but no-one's perfect Betty, please, a brandy, to bring him back to life! Thank you! The great writer! But you uncouth louts, you don't read! I met with Howard in 1945 in the Black Forest, on the Danube and Neckar with the 1st French army. De Lattre had saved them then, so we will not be more royalist than the king himself! What do you celebrate? Your upcoming battle at Dien Bien Phu? Come on, we are here to have fun not be serious! Thus, I organized this booze-up! because I'm alive! Thanks to him! Come here! Meet this Sgt Tadeusz Korzenevsky! The First Chasseurs Polish soldier in the service of France! And wants to get married! About time, I think. This Polack carried me back! He probably decided that my body would do as a shield And, as for you - Puppet, as he is called by his friends on the other side. Ki - lieutenant in the 5th Vietnamese battalion of paratroopers the famous "5th Bavouan! There was a time when you were a bit of a Vietminh shooting at us, motherfucker! Now he tolerates us as allies. No more than that! Comrades! The priests released him from the sins of his youth! Father Vamburger, a very Catholic man He knows the blackness of our souls! He, too, we need. Man cannot live by bread and combat rations alone, is it not so, Father? M.Jegu de Kerveguen! You drink too much! - Oh! Duroc! A former pilot of the Free French and "Normandy-Nieman" Squadron shot down twice by the Boche, first over Kurland, the other - over Konigsberg, Hero of the Soviet Union, Honorary corporal in the Legion! A little crazy! Dien Bien Phu - he's there every day flying in the expedition supplies and then quietly returns here, drink this fresh white cocktail, you scoundrel! And now - the worst! You see these two reprobates in civilian clothes? God save us, a senior corporal and a Sergeant, I think. I've never seen them in uniform. Cameramen who follow neither God nor master! How I envy them sometimes, these nitwits! Why? Because they are alive, mon vieux! And all that goes with it! Two innocents without responsibility... And whatever happens, when it happens they can always say to St. Peter, standing at the gate: "But we had great fun!" And you can't say so? If only, but will be unhappy! Sunday, 14 March, 00:15 "Beatrice" no longer replies We start our pass over 'la cuvette' from the north passing just over "Beatrice" grouping at the exit, 350 meters, 170 km / h, drop our cargo, a difficult manouveur. We flew along just above "Dominique" "Eliane" - a course to the south. Here... Sharp turn to the right, height - 140 meters. It remains only to peacefully slip away with one hand, clenching your fists in happiness turned - and voila! - What happened? 50 calibre machine guns - here and here. A little further away - Russian 37mm cannon Very good, very accurate. And if the Vietminh could take "Beatrice"? We need to defend her! To keep them at a distance Dien Bien Phu - is an air battle! All our brave soldiers at the bottom - do the fighting while we fly safely over their heads. Do not laugh, I'm absolutely serious! - Good evening, Captain! - O, Morvan! What's the matter, old man? You look gloomy ! You lost your boss? Howard I present Captain Morvan, Third Bureau, General Staff Cream of society, close to the top! Look, I'm practically alone in the department. It's all bad. I can't get to the general. Dien Bien? Do not be mad, man. Tomorrow at dawn everything will fall into place. One of heights? "Beatrice." - The III/13 DBLE - What? Legion? Such concentrated artillery never happened before! Colonel Gaucher. And all his staff. All were killed? "Bavouan" will rise to the occasion I'm going back to base. Then what are you doing here? You will receive orders in time, Lieutenant! - Who will replace Gaucher? - Langlais - Lieutenant Colonel, a para. They say he's good. - What is he doing? - I do not know. Perhaps waiting for the dawn. - It looks like they're all stunned. - But what does this mean? The commander must be there to whip up them into shape Sunday, 14 March, 6:30 am. Come on, come on, get up, you old sod! Mau-len! - Come, come! You old bugger! I think you've won! I won? I didn't sleep! I haven't eaten! All the time, "Mau-len! I know nothing... I won what? By the way, truly - your trishaw no longer squeaks! It's great! Praise God! You will be rewarded! Your 20 piastres with Mr. Tigre in "Ong Cop"! I've lost and you won... Open the door! Open up! Mau-len! Master sleeping! So bad to scream! Go wake your master! Mau-len! Quiet! What is it? Have you seen the time? Are you drunk? Sorry. I have come to offer you a little business. You crazy? My wife sleeps! Listen! I have a scoop I would like to share it with you! Under certain conditions. Why me? You represent AFP . An international agency. I need to get my scoop out there. What can you offer? Need to have your telegram sent immediately bypassing censorship. Well? - Dien Bien Phu! I knew it. Much more! You are sure of yourself! Okay. I'll do what I can. Okay! Come on! "Beatrice" is lost! One battalion of the Legion destroyed. The French batteries are helpless. And a big fish killed Colonel... Gaucher. And all his staff. And it seems that the command of Dien Bien Phu were absolutely... taken aback! - Merde! - Is it true? - I bet your head. Listen. You Americans, You spit on us and on our, as you say, colonial war. But be warned! If you're lying, If this is nonsense I'll get you deported! -Keep your telegram! but lend me your car. I've got to get to the airport. Why? The first flight to Hong Kong departs in an hour . He will take my article to Hong Kong and from there it will pass by telex to San Fransisco Just in time for morning edition. I do not want to go through censorship. What are you doing here? Are you leaving? No, no. I'm looking for a pilot going to Hong Kong. He's on the runway. You want to send your article? It's not fair. I know the pilot. He's my friend. I introduce you, Mr... Simson. - Simpson. - Simpson. Mr Simpson, tell the truth. Only the truth. About our war, about us there are too many lies. Come! - Oh, hi! - Do me favor, please. Give this to Hong Kong. - Sure. You jump this morning? No - We wait. Adieu, monsieur! - Take care of yourself! You too. There are the two Bretons. Faster, we still have five more! You tired of waiting? You were right, there was better than here. Oh, shit! - It's okay. Does it hurt? This is... Lord God! Be merciful, do not let our enemies divide us! The Lord of Israel! Save us from our troubles! The disciples fell on their faces, in horror. But Jesus came near, touched them and said: "Stand up, do not be afraid! of what are you afraid?" They looked up and saw nothing but Jesus. So.. Corpus Christi! Corpus Christi! Ah! You know? Mr Vinh - a famous man! He's a bit of a humanist, a free thinker, nationalist, Socialist and on the side of the Vietminh guerrillas. And I think he does not like us. I love France! But this does not mean much to the French! Do not presume too much! The commander has decided to throw in the 5 th BPVN - A counter-attack? - There's worse, man. They agreed to the truce, proposed the Vietnamese, to supposedly pick up the wounded from "Beatrice". None of this is any good! Eveyone out! Mau-len! Get away. get away! We're going! Get away! Sunday, 14 March. Afternoon. 5th Bavouan dropped into Dien Bien Phu Fire! Faster - regroup To me! Mau-len! Monday, 15 March, 5 in the morning. Strongpoint "Gabriel" Partly captured, still fighting! Sir! Sir! The radio! OK Yes, sir! This is HQ! Counterattack! Take command yourself! Head for the north! - Counterattack where? Gabriel, go! Mau-len! It's a mess! No lights ! - Orders, Sir? - Everyone up! Move north! - Mau-len, move fast! Up! Up! Mau-len! Mau-len! Move! Come on, up! Forward! First squad - single file! Forward! Mau-len! 7:30 am. At the end of the runway "Bavouan" held up - enemy fire. Go! Spread out! Forward! Stand up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Now, march! Come on, get out! Forward! Let's go! Spread out! - Gun! - Yes, Sir! Left, left! Vietminh! They are there! On the left! On the left there! 8:00 am. Last defenders of "Gabrielle" forced off the position! What a mess! Gabrielle's finished! All down the drain! Another battalion and Gabrielle would've held! I was within 50 meters, when the infantry began to fall back. Who gave this stupid order? And you? Why you were not here? 30 guys! I've lost 30 good Legionaires for nothing! I tell you, man! We've lost Battle of Dien Bien Phu today! This morning! We will fight on but the end will be swift! Hey, hang on! In my company, three people, One officer-cadet, 2 non-commissioned officers, I demand they be immediately court-martialled for cowardice in the face of the enemy! They need to be shot today! I've never shot a paratrooper! We do not do it! Because this is not your war? In the war of 1914 - 1918, when France was under threat, you did not hesitate! - Enough! With all due respect, sir you are wrong. - Enough! - And de Castries is not right. Not shooting his subordinates, we look weaker. Giap - he shoots without hesitation ... - Enough! I give you these three as coolies Right gentlemen... Arrange a clean-up in the battalion, rest the men Tonight will be long. We believe that the next Vietminh target is "Anne-Marie." There's wounded! To your posts! Rumor has it that the fall of Dien Bien Phu is imminent The French need an excuse get out of this dirty war which they themselves started more than 9 years ago. The French know very well they can't win. They're not fools! They're hoping for a draw. Hoping! But the result will be total defeat! they'll wash their hands and run! With the secret relief. And you, Mr. Vinh? The fall of Dien Bien Phu you have arranged? Don't you want to answer? "You're singing?" This is the case." So go to the same source! Lafontaine. Mr. Lafontaine's fable "The Grasshopper and the Ant." I learned it by heart, to obtain a diploma of education. You see, he who has a second language has a second soul, Mr. Simpson. My old Tonkinese soul will be proud of defeating the enemy. My young French soul will definitely grieve a little. I - a grasshopper. maybe, should learn your language Mr. Simpson. To dance with you if the French win. You are too complicated for me Mr. Vinh. Your friend from "Ong cop" is easier to know with his fake Buddha mug. "Ong cop," he's not my friend! He's Chinese! When he can no longer to conduct his criminal business, He will leave for Hong Kong. Without looking back. You will also leave. And the French. And I -I will remain. What else is left? What can the trapped rat do? Gnaw at the imaginary paw. Fire! Fire! Dien Bien Phu will fall very soon now! Do you understand? It will not last as long as I expected. Will have to find something else for all these people to bet on. Maybe an American invasion? What do you think, dear friend? Very interesting, Mr. Tigre! Tell me later how you enticed those fans to bet. Good information, excellent! Let's see! What did you bet on, you old bugger? 20 piastres - on "Anne Marie" being finished tonight! 20 piastres - on "Dominique" finished tonight! 20 piastres - on Dien Bien Phu finished in 2 days! 20 - on "Anne-Marie! Bet 20 piastres for me! 20 piastres! All - stand to! Defend "Anne-Marie! Keep the Viet Minh off! Fire! Fire! But, my dear Howard! This is an old French tradition! Napoleon III had already given the Legion to Maximilian Emperor of Mexico! And the beautiful Jenny! Today the generous Fourth Republic lent us... gratis and irrevocably to His Majesty Bao Dai, Emperor of Annam, and His Majesty Sisavang Vong king of Laos, and His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, King of Cambodia. By the way... to be in the service, simultaneously, of one emperor, two kings and as a side benefit - the French Republic. That's eclectic, eh? Done! It's a boy! Boy! He has such eggs, my captain! Half this size, I swear! I can't believe it! Senior Quartermaster Korzenevsky, I ask you to behave yourself! I'll treat you! Tuesday, 16 March, 9 am Navarre is in Hanoi. He is talking to Cogny: "The drop should be expected the next night." It is, Cogny said, at 9 o'clock. I quote De Castries: "The next attack could knock us out!" Colonel Piroth, responsible for the artillery, yesterday morning, took his own life - suicide. Suicide? Why? But it's obvious! Piroth swore he would destroy the Vietminh artillery! He pulled the pin from a grenade and lay down on it. He was buried secretly, so as not to demoralize the troops. But it is - between us! Do not tell anyone! Sorry! Whew! Hello! - Hello, sir! Let me introduce you my personal chauffeur Mr. Lee Wan Ya. Sit down, you old bastard. Three beer, quick! I'll pay! What is it? 6th Colonial Parachute already flying to Dien Bien Phu! My friends up there, and I'm stuck here like a moron because of this stupid show! Cover the concert. General's Orders. The General likes music? No! Just that Dien Bien Phu is bad news, He wants to change the picture. In Hanoi, order prevails under my rule! What has"Ong cop" predicted for tonight? "Dominique?" "Eliane"? "Anne-Marie"? For "Anne-Marie" - it's over! Anne-Marie? I was supposed to be with them. They could fly me. I'm a moron! Now I'm going to surprise you! There are people who still bet on the French! Due to Bigeard Soothsayers say that he who favors the Moon. will have a mandate from Heaven. Do you understand? This Bigeard - he sends his people, his soldiers to their death! And they love him for it, and he loves it. And he does this and for what? For whom? For the sake of those whom he loves? he hates? he despises? For the sake of speculators? Inept politicians? for the sake of all! For me? And for you, Mr. Simpson! Funny situation, is not it? Very funny! What do they say? A paradox? Exactly! A paradox! Why Francois? This - the French from all the names, my captain. Well, with such a mug, it is very useful, poor thing! Francois Korzenevsky and his mother, Mrs. Korzenevska! Lovely baby! Elegant! I dream, I will marry and give birth to children. I let them cut off legs until it was too late. I will do my best to feed them the rest of their lives. So long as they're not sailors. So long as they're not sailors! De Castries yesterday ordered Bigeard to take out their air defenses. There! In the west! Beautifully done! Spot on! Excellent result. On the field were more than 400 dead, couple of dozens of prisoners, heavy guns. Vietminh from the 308th division retreated in disarray. Hmm, this whole Bigeard thing! I came, I saw, I conquered! He was always lucky! But we also had losses. This success had an immediate affect on morale. The chiefs are beginning to ask themselves, not so fast, Have we been too hasty? All in all, something was needed - Bigeard a simple battalion commander! Why have we waited so long? - Listen. Here is your landing zone. They will select a place depending on the defense. Jump - between 120 and 80 meters. So you're not too long in the air. How did you managed to swing this? What with your wounds? Carrying a bag for the Minister of War in Paris when I was younger, it helps! How did you get it? Well, he loves me! I did him a little blowjob over the phone He, with great warmth called me a fool, and asked me to find a good reason so that he could personally intervene. He knows this is a ... one-way ticket? Last stop, everyone out! He knows about this? He gave me this honor, old man! His telegram created a stir in the General Staff. "Cabinet Minister to Commander Ground Troops in North Vietnam" "Urgent confidential personal stop" "Captain Victor Jegu de Kerveguen" "Immediately seconded to the garrison of Dien Bien Phu ", etc. etc. Head of haste when he is satisfied with a short circuit. You'll pay for it. He is more optimistic than you! He believes all I say! Give this to Langlais. He wants to give you strongpoint "Hugette-7". That's it. Give my respects to De Castries when you see him. I like him. Okay, get out before my boss says no. I... And God speed! What are you doing here? You're going to jump? But why? It's lost? Fog, mist! And so every morning! Strongpoint Dominique remains visible. Where you fall, I don't know but I guarantee not on the Vietminh It's in your interest! Perhaps flak will be less Bigeard assures us. It's possible, but it's almost as good as the Boche, the bastards! It felt like we were over Konigsberg in 1945! Take a course to the southwest, flying 1.5 hours. - Dear Friend - Hello! My articles for Hong Kong, as usual. Thank you, thank you! - Howard! - OK Come here, I have something to show you! Right, hold this!" Look! All of them - our last line of defence. And all straight from the parachute course - all ready to go. They're bread for the ducks! And it's true! Bread for the ducks! And it's all reserves, you have left? Oh, no. We still have 3 battalions of parachutists in stock. They still decided to send them to us, but for the drop. Too late! Scary! - But... - Stop it, stop it! I didn't bring you here to criticize HQ. Look! It's all about what I ask of you. That's what I tell you. Soldiers prepared to die to fulfill their mission. It is a contract. We ourselves have chosen this - our honor. Only a soldier can not tolerate it when he is sent to die for nothing! Because of stupidity or because of incompetence... or theft. We are outraged! Purely professional response - we do not like being wasted. You understand what I mean? Look! All these guys spent, wasted! Bread for the ducks! And they all know it! Everything! And all of them - volunteers allowing themselves to be wasted one last time. And even pushed to fly. That's what I wanted you to see! Write about it. It needs to be said! Even if you're too thick to understand it. Tell them about it! Howard! Just don't break your head! There's nothing to understand! Who are you? Buddhist, Catholic? I - an animist. My children! Who wants to, come closer! We will offer a prayer! Our prayer! Give me, O Lord, the strength to face what comes! Give me what I need! Help me with the uncertainty With the experience of battle, so I will know you'll always be there! For it is not always, I will have courage Forgive me, Father, We're loading up! For you alone, O Lord! And we wait on none but you! Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit! Amen! 25! 24! 23! At least, the audience never won a single match! 22! 21! So far, man! Huh? I spoke in jest! 19! Lord! - 17! - Here are your sons! They have already fought so long, Father! Have pity on these boys, that pass before the gate You are already calling their names! 5! 4! 3! 2! - Lord! - One! - I beg you, help them! Help them! I implore you! - Hey! flak! - Don't worry! 2 minutes to go! get a move on! As soon as the buzzer stops, you stop! I don't want them hitting the Vietminh Go on, son! Helmets! On your head! Bandages! The pockets! Door! Up! Hook up! First! Ready! One, two, three, four, five, six, Seven... Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Stop! Stop! Stop! Washington have already asked me to conduct research into the possibility of one or more massive raids by Superfortress B29s around Dien Bien Phu. Lafayette, we're here! Whew! I can cite my sources? With my blessing, old man! A calculated leak, an open secret! A sort of a way to tell the Chinese: "Achtung!" Eisenhower became President by promising to achieve peace in Korea. And not rush into an adventure in Indochina! In this case - you're on your own. Alone! Completely alone! I know. We know. Be realistic! If we were only realistic, we would have long since left this country! MARCH 30, 17 HOURS AFTER NOON - a minute's rest Calm before the storm Two Breton. I do not know them. One - from the Legion, the other - an infantryman. Sir! I have grenades, ammunition and other supplies which must be delivered to Rothe's position - Hold on, son! Mamadou, call Simon - this stuff is for him. Sit down! Simon, your ammo! - Tan, go with him! - Yes, captain. Well, son, let them get on with it. Come on, here! The beginning of the second act! Great, eh? Ah? Look, hold on. There - just behind the sunset. All this - the same thing. But still funny! The same thing! And it's great we know it! You don't see the connection? You don't see any connection between these mines and the sun? Ah! You take me for a mad man! No, no, sir, I never said that! The same thing! When the apple bounced off his head he knew at once! A genius! Old Isaac! The sun, apple, eureka! You still do not understand? But you went to school? Isaac Newton! The Law of Gravity! The same law governs the trajectory of the bullets and the trajectory of the Earth around the Sun! It's so nice to know! It calms! You see, my son! To us it does not fall by accident! It's the law! Take cover! take cover! Down here. Sit down here, get the men. Stand to! Stand to! Break out supplies for four! Yes, sir! Gunners load up! Charge! Aim 1 and then 5-0! And fire! Charge 5, fire!

Do not see this is a unique night? All these night owls on the brink! All of these lice are so decent! Do not play the fool! You still remember that late night! They say that this violinist is not so bad! 19:15 After continuous shelling Demoralized and wthout officers Algerian and Moroccan infantry abandon strongpoints "Dominique-2" and "Eliane" An hour later, the Vietminh reach Nam Youm river It's over, Mamadou!

Fire! Fire! Okay, guys, good! They're in range! Slightly to the left, left! Good! Fire! Yes! We will stop them! 21:00. Strongpoint Hugette-7" Dug in on the southern slopes the defenders await the Vietminh attack. "Floral," - "Louis." Vietminh here. On my signal drop everything you have, to the north of my position. "Floral", you got it! Everything ready. Impact time - 30 seconds. In your own interest - keep your heads down! "Floral," - "Louis!" Fire! "Floral"! Kick off! 3 and 4 volleys on their way. You will have ... 25 seconds... 20 seconds... 15 seconds... 10 seconds... 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Go! My heart is overwhelmed with sadness. How to explain... I've always had a strange feeling that this is - a farewell party! I don't feel the general is going to give you a polite "Good-bye!" The General? Who said anything about the general? France, Mr. Simpson! France! Nations feel things more than we think! I still have to get my gear: camera, film, all... Take a bottle of cognac! That'll make them happy! I almost forgot! Betty Please a bottle! I'll sign the bill, and pay upon return. Betty, in your shoes I would not agree. Where he's going, you know... Occupational hazard! Credit - is the foundation of our economy, my dear Lieutenant! Beautifully said! You, Betty, - a poet! And the real owner of the bar! 75 piastres per litre of brandy! And your hand didn't shake! Here they are Chinese! Yeah, a lot in common. Bravo! Well, you look us up in the club after such a triumph! But I love you all! I allowed myself to invite our conductor, Mr. Bong. I do not think that it is usual with French soldiers. That's all - , but they're my friends. And, Howard! - Excellent! - Thank you! Mr Simpson. - Bravo! - No embrace? What are you doing with this bottle? At your age, too? He jumps tomorrow! He'll need it down there! I found a place. It wasn't easy. You were wonderful! You too! I'll tell Captain de Kerveguen. Again! Anyone here who jumps tomorrow? Excuse me, sir. Captain! I'm doing all the bars getting people from the Airborne. - What is it? - Red Alert. I have to check-in. If airborne are jumping, so am I. It is not yet official but this is for Dien Bien Phu. I would like to stay longer, but. I need to run. Goodbye! I was happy that... Do not run so fast! My little man Good luck! You forgot your bottle. "A brief overview of the situation March 30, 22:15." Dominique-1, -2 and -6, Elian-1 all fallen. "Elian-2 is still partly ours. Stop." Fighting still on a completely surrounded Hugette-7. All other positions under attack. "Unable to restore the situation without reinforcement. Signrd: De Castries." March 31, at 6 o'clock. This is my slut, always in my hands. She even has her own "condom",the stinker. And if you need to open it on the go, joker? At the height they would drop us, I won't have time to open it, a joker! Okay! The countdown is over. All out! We're not going! The drop at Dien Bien Phu is cancelled! - And the others? - No, cancelled until further orders. Hey, out the way! Come on, Mau-len! You see, my son! Death - a triumph of gravity! No - Koulibali The same law of gravity, Isaac Newton's ancient law! What are you doing here? Up! Up, I say, pull yourself together! Go on, go with the PIMs! Get a grip! Understand!! I'll take you in the truck. What do you want? The dead... what do we..? Take the dead. They fought well. Get a grip! Go! Go! Stop! Wait here. Look out, right! Go! Medic! Get to the top Watch out Forward! I'm held up on the approaches to 'Eliane 1' Need reinforcements.. to gain a foothold here... over! No reinforcements here! All of our reserves are thrown at "Eliane-2"! None available, over Understood, out. Come on, get back! Mau-len! Mau-len! Move! Move! We are pulling back. Give us covering fire! I repeat, covering fire! 15 hours. Without reinforcements the two strongpoints - "Eliane" AND "Dominique-2" are abandoned. Colonel Langlais yelling about treason. He wasn't dropped any paratroopers. He had to abandon two heights, Bigeard had retaken. This massive drop in the middle of the day - they'll be massacred! It's too late. It should have been done last week. And so, abandon the idea of reinforcing entrenched troops? No, parachute at the night! Aircraft in line with an interval of 2 minutes, stick after stick! Directly on to the main position. The entire battalion land in half an hour. Half of the men hang on the wire, hit mines or fall on the Vietminh Stop it! You seem unable to make a clear choice! Or do you think that Dien Bien Phu is lost, and you leave them to die. Alone. Or you choose to stay. Then send them support.. But... you're just a "sad sack". You will lose them all! And lose the battle! APRIL 2. So, this - put it on immediately. Doctor! .. Doctor! - What? - Come on, take a look! No, it's in the stomach! I can't! The operation takes at least 2 hours! With only 1in 10 chance that he will pull through. I can't! Damn, I told you! But it's Pierrot, a guy from the Bigeard's 6th BPC! I know him! It happened on Eliane! Impossible! I'm sick of it! What can I do? Look! Alright, stick a label on him and carry him to the operating room. It's all shit! All shit! Father, forgive me! There's a Lieutenant of the Legion. He will not survive long. He asks for you Right. - Who's she? - Genevieve. What are you doing here? Get to work. You get out. Now pour, pour! He must be asleep! He has to sleep. Everything will be fine. Gently, gently, gently! Well, alright, kid? Quietly! Lend me your binoculars! This is it! Get on the ball! Mau-len! All those white dots - They're parachutes. Brings to mind the conquistadors burning their boats on unfamiliar rivers, so there was no temptation to return and try their luck. For me... all these white dots - they're burning boats. 4 APRIL After weeks of close combat Strongpoint "Eliane-2" ia still holding APRIL 5. Strongpoint Hugette-7 "has fallen. Strongpoint Hugette-6 surrounded, "Eliane-2" holding on Where did you get coffee? 6 people deserted last night. It turns out there's 12 of us left in the platoon. Another two were about to go, and, perhaps, already gone. Okay, we won't run after them. You got any bread? - No, - What? - I do not know. I like you, Tien. you're Vietnamese, I like you. Coffee, captain? - Oh, yeah. Thank you. Coffee. APRIL 8 Come on, come on! Let's keep going, dammit! lieutenant, we are getting close! Let's hurry! Hurry! - He's dead! - Huh? - He's dead! - Dead? No, he's not dead! - Yes, he's dead! - No, he's not dead, he is not dead! This is my lieutenant, my father! He's not dead, he's not dead! Pull him up! Get out! This is already full of wounded! Many people - lost, abandoned... hide in the caves in the banks of the Nam-Youm - Want some food? - here, eat. April 10. We recapture strongpoint Eliáne. The Vietminh are already nibbling at Hugette-1. Last night we dropped a platoon of 2nd BEP He let himself be persuaded? I dropped them in groups of 10. Any more and they would've fallen on the Vietminh. Into a meat grinder. Bigeard sent us his report. Terrific! He has about 2,000 soldiers on the front line paratroopers and legionnaires. With artillery, engineers, and the three tanks that are still on the go He believes Dien Bien Phu is fighting with less than 4 thousand men. The rest - wounded - Or hiding. Deserters. Sitting in the holes in the banks of the river. He calls them "the rats of Nam-Youm." Giap has De Castries by the throat! It's logical! I watch the picture! De Castries can still breathe thanks to a drop! I look forward to when he is nearly suffocated. I'm waiting. This is Asian patience! I am waiting, sir! And the blow straight to the heart! One stroke. Never divide the skin until the bear is dead! Bigeard recaptured 'Eliane 1'! The bear is not dead! Many have lost money on today's bet! Why do we kill a bear? if the not to share his skin? This Chinese proverb I do not know. This adage is from one of my Jewish friends from Brooklyn. April 12. "Hugette-6" surrounded, but still holds. 13 APRIL MILITARY CAMP In the Red River Delta We need two tank commanders - two gunners and two drivers. We need volunteers immediately to go to Hanoi Training will be minimal. You will jump almost immediately. Please I must add, although it's not in my instructions but I must say it. The situation at Dien Bien Phu is desparate! Do not harbor any illusions. Volunteers step forward! Brigade-chef Henri de la Monier, driver. Sgt Tadeusz Korzenevsky, tank commander. And what, you're going too? a parachute jump? At your age it's stupid! In any case, it's too late! Late? Why? For a priest it is never too late. To sacrifice their lives - is a huge sacrifice. There is one, which is even more terrible. To sacrifice honor! Hey! Is anybody there? Hey, Is anybody there? Is anybody there? Hey, here! Come on, get out of there! How it stinks, death! Tadeusz! But what are you doing here? I fell straight on the dead! Where is the Legion's first battalion? We can't stay here. Hey, you come too! We can't stay here! Come on, let's go! There's no longer much to look at. Cognac - pastis. No, pastis - cognac. A third of pastis, two thirds - of cognac. Cognac. Pastis Legionnaire Komorowski, 2nd foreign battalion, the 3rd company. Comrade! Life - that we must drink to the last drop. And we in Poland have a saying: life - like an onion. The more you remove the skin, the more it stinks. And at the finish, your eyes fill with tears! Cognac! Rats crawl out at night in search of food in the discarded containers. French - Rain - Rat. Rain is good for the Viet Minh. Very good. The French don't mix with rats! Come on. Take him to the hospital. He might live. APRIL 18 Easter Sunday Vic, we have nothing for you. You're on your own. you have the right to stop fighting. Can you hold on a little more? if there's any point. You could try to breakout but we have no means to support you. Come in, Vic! Vic. I will try to breakout. Out. Come on. Good-bye, boys. Destroy the radio! Don't shoot until you're sure of your target! If fired on during the attack, We slow down and shoot accurately! And lessen the risk of shooting our own! When we reach the goal, we change clips. This could be a very long time - change clips then! Attack! The captain has improvised flak jackets. Good luck! Hugette-1 opens up with covering fire to help Hugette-6. Don't shoot!Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You're here too? You're OK! Here we are in the woods. Safe. Where were you wounded? Me - on Hugette. I was scared! Viet Minh troops have suffered such losses, that Giap asks to be sent to Dien Bien Phu more than 25,000 new recruits. He also summoned the aid of their 176 th Regiment and the last reserves of the 304th Division. On our side - We have strengthened the garrison with a parachute battalion thrown in in small packets. For us, it's like Verdun as De Castries rightly said. The conditions there... are simply unimaginable! The senior medical officer there is reporting deaths from shock, from exhaustion, not from wounds, for no reason! Monsieur, monsieur. - Yes, my son! - I don't believe in God! I don't believe your stories! I don't believe! Then let me do my job. Monsieur, monsieur! Yes, my son! I need to say something to you, monsieur! - Come, tell me! - I shall die here, sir! No - really! It is hard, sir! - Hey, listen, stop calling me Monsieur! - Yes, sir! Yes, father. I am sick. No - not really. I'm not like them. I need to tell someone. I'm a rat - and I'll die like a rat. A rat. A rat of Nam-Youm. And I'm dying - a rat. I'm not like you, guys! Not like you! I'm a rat! Calm down, my son! I had to say it. I had to say it. I don't want to die without confessing it. My poor boy! De Lattre and his son Bernard. The last picture of them together. As if they both know it. Reminiscent of stained glass in the church. "Bernard did not die for France. He died for Vietnam." So said his father, Marshal of France. And it's true. "The unselfish actions of this present war," "France has not seen since the Crusades." Also De Lattre. Aha! Fuck this damn country! APRIL 29 "Eliane" is about to fall The last reserves of paratroops are throw into the battle! APRIL 30 Camerone Day, the Legion's holiday. They heard someone shouting: "We're hit, we're hit!" Certainly, the co-pilot. And the next thing - the voice of Duroc. Very calm... very... without emotion. "The right engine out." Propeller -feathered. Langor wounded." "I've set course for Luang Prabang." That's all! That was the last radio contact. He never made it to Luang Prabang. Nobody knows where he came down. Volunteers! MAY 1 "Eliane" finally falls! I need volunteers. Anyone who can carry a weapon! Come on, guys! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! I've no unit, I've nothing. Okay. Come with me. Only don't screw up! Otherwise I'll give you to the Vietminh! I swear! Report to Captain de Kerveguen MAY 4, 17 HOURS Strongpoint 'Eliane-2, Our last high point. A mixed company of Legion, "Bavouan', and infantry The last reserves! What are you waiting for? The radio! Get the radio! Medic! Medic! Medic... Come on! Are you okay? We knew that for 2 weeks the Vietminh dug a tunnel into the hill to mine it. Hi, Ki! Still alive? Kerveguen! The Vietminh are still digging, getting very close. Hearing digging, that's fine. It's when they stop... But for now -they dig. Radio! MAY 5 THe last battalion of paratroops in Tonkin. all untrained volunteers from every unit. Sorry but I need to get ready. - I need to pee. - use the wheel. Vic! Hey, you coming or what? Come on, Hurry up! Sorry. Two, one! Enough! Full up! Come back tomorrow! - And us? - No room! Oh! fuck, fuck! Go, go away! Bastards! They say there's no room! Come on, we'll take your gear! Eliane-2, 6 May, 17 HOURS You moron, what's with this bravado? Helmet! The Vietminh must know that the Legion is here Captain! Okay. Do the rounds in 10 minutes. - Yes, it will be done. Shit! Shit! Oh, Shit... "Eliane-2, handover complete. - Okay, you can go now . The Vietminh haven't dug for an hour. That means it could blow at any moment. Dead. What do we know of the dead? Only that we can soon be like them. 18 hours "Eliane-2" finally surrounded! May 6, 23 hours Eliane-2 here. Vietminh blew the mine. I have 35 able-bodied men left. Send reinforcements. Over! We've no reinforcements. Out! Eliane-2, Understood! Will destroy this post. For me it's over. "Eliane-4. The Vietminh are here. It's over. I'm destroying my post. For the paras, for the Legion! Hip, hip, hip! Eliane-3. They are already in the trenches. I see them. They're coming for me. "Claudine-5" captured. The infantry, the Legion! All my friends, goodbye! MAY 7, 6 am Aircraft return to Hanoi, bringing back their loads. Mr Vinh! Did you have before or after midnight? MAY 7, 13 HOURS Our last hope - Holding out until nightfall Then breaking out to the West It's over, padre. For us who are here, all over. Fun place, eh? A soldier must, in his actions take an example from pubic lice. This elegant animal dies, but never surrenders. Thus spake old Joffre. Radio, captain, radio! - Yes! - Order of the General.! No breakout. Cease-fire at 17:30. Destroy weapons! If I have to stop fighting, I need a written order. Don't argue! Obey, like everyone else! That's an order! Out. I need a written order! Alright, alright, come and get it! Out! I'll get it, captain. To the Legion! My regiment - Colonial artillery... A glass of wine... He's dead. Friday, May 7, 1954, 17:30 Destroy your weapons. Destroy your weapons. Farewell to the Silk Road! What do you think about the opening of my piece in the paper? Listen. Is this punishment of a stern Lord? Then, among the cries, the rumors, the guns He heard a voice reply: "No!" It's not mine! This is Victor Hugo. So long, Mr Vinh! We were immediately separated from our Vietnamese comrades in arms. Is this punishment, stern Lord? He - will die. And him. And him. And him...and him... and him... Almost three-quarters of them die. Nearly 7700 people never returned! This movie was filmed almost 40 years after the battle of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam. In Tonkin, as we once called it. Together with the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese army. It was an moving experience both for them and for us. and will close a painful page in our history. It makes sense only if we have re-established contact with the Vietnam, we love... I love...
