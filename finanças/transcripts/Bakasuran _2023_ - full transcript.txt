Thanks for coming. You asked me to come urgently. What’s the matter, mam? A murder case, sir. A couple came from Chennai and stayed here. The wife was shot dead. The husband is the suspect. Because he ordered a gun online and we seized the gun too. But we couldn’t find any bullets in the spot. According to the CCTV footage, the husband left at 8:00 in the morning. At that time, wife was standing here. The husband didn’t come back. Then how did he go inside, how did the murder happen? How did he escape? I can't understand anything, sir. Sir! Mam, you seized the gun, right? Yes, sir. Then you could've investigated in your routine and got the statement. That’s the problem, sir. The husband is a big lawyer. I can't take up second degree treatment. I just need to close the case. The bullet penetrated in and went outside. If we trace the bullet, we can easily remand him, sir. Can I get any forensic report of this case? Yeah, I have. Give those photos. Have a look. Guna, open the windows just like in this photos. Mam, what’s the height of the victim? What’s the height? 152 cm, mam. -152 cm, sir. 152 cm, quite short. Guna... -Yes, brother. Please, come here. Give me the laser pointer. Mam, when you arrived here was the door open? No sir, it was latched inside. Can we see outside, please? It’s possible that it was triggered from here. How are you saying, sir? The gun you showed in the photograph is "Baby eagle 9mm gun". It's bullet speed will cross at 400m speed in a second. Basically, it’s used for hunting. When the bullet penetrated and went out, then it must be at killing range. It is more likely to happen from this spot. Guna, sit down. Please come. Mam, when you took the photograph, was the door open or close? It was closed, sir. Guna, give me the screw driver. Sir, how? But on that day, the door was closed. I told you, isn't it, mam? The pressure of that gun. The pierced bullet touched the keyhole... ...it bounced on the wall and the door was closed by itself. Excellent, sir!. Thank you so much. It’s all your's. Thank you. -Welcome! Here it is, mam. Who is he, mam? Does he belong to our department? Major Arulvarman. He served in "Short Service Commission" for 14 years and retired. Now he is posting the crime investigations... ...as videos on YouTube and living peacefully. Often, he will help our department also. Then, call the victim’s husband to the station for investigation. Okay mam, I will tell him to come. -I will not spare him. (A Devotional song on Lord Shiva) -Om nama shivaya! Bless me, swamy. Swamy, tomorrow is "no moon day". You must come to my home and have food. I will come and take you along. You must come to eradicate our sins. Sure. I'm leaving, swamy. -Okay. Dear, my goddess! Swamy! Will you call this vagabond also to eat at your home? It's a longing to eat food served by virtuous woman like you. Don’t mistake me. No, swamy It’s a good deed to serve food when you are hungry. Definitely I'll call you for next "no moon day" and serve a feast. Praise the God. -I'm leaving, swamy. Stay blessed. Come, dear. Ready, brother. Rolling...Action... Greetings to all viewers. This is Major Varma. So far, on our YouTube channel... ...we have talked about many criminal case investigations. …and even created awareness too. An unexpected incident happened in Karnataka state in 2009. In the district of Dakshina Karnataka, Cyanide Mohan acted as a jeweller... ...and killed twenty women for jewellery. All the women he targeted were unmarried, who couldn't give dowry. How that man seduced and killed those twenty women... ...is what I'm going to share with you. Listen carefully. Before that, Won’t you put the phone on silent mode? I was going in a flow and you are spoiling it. See who it is. Hello! What are you saying? What? Your niece Ramya has committed suicide. Ramya! Did she commit suicide! What are you saying? Pack everything. Come soon. Sir, why are you here? She is my own brother’s daughter. Oh! Sorry sir. Can I go and see inside? Yes, you go. Guna, you stay here. Arul, she was more affectionate to you more than me. She cheated us and left like this. She would've told atleast to you to see another bridegroom. Ramya, your uncle has come, see dear. Sir! What is the problem they say about? Sir, they have fixed a groom who is a relative. The girl was not interested it seems. They forced her and made all the arrangements. So, she committed suicide. Sir, he is the girl’s uncle. -Greetings, sir. Is it only because she didn’t like the groom... ...or is there any other problem in the family, sir? As I know, there is no other reason, sir. I have even heard the groom is good, sir. Do you suspect anyone? We don’t suspect anyone, sir. She said very emphatically that she did not want to get married. We ignored not listening to her. Okay Major, let's start the formalities. -Okay sir! Mam. -Sir. Get the corpse to the ambulance. You come to the station and finish rest of the formalities. Definitely, sir. Did you recover that girl’s things and cell phone? Yes, mam. Then take the corpse to the ambulance. Sister! Ramya, you are leaving us, dear! -Move...move... Ramya! -Get on. Ramya! -Fast, take the vehicle soon. Ramya! A man of action, a supporter of women, the philanthropist... ...He is our brother Dr. MR. Nagarajan. I invite him to give special address. This meeting is to protest the violence against women. Today the stance of women in the country is very alarming. They are enslaved. -I'm here with the boss. The meeting will go on till 10.30... Greetings, brother. I will call back. Come, Rasu. -Are you good, brother? I'm good. Did you get any job? For my education, will I get a job of district collector? I’m working for daily wages only. Brother, I’m asking you for six months... ...Recommend to the boss and get me a small job, brother. Food and accommodation is enough for me. I will be grateful forever. You are coming continuously. I will convey the boss and try if I can do anything. Do one thing, come home on Sunday. Let me see your work and decide later. Thank you very much, brother. I will come. Brother, please come. Why this hassle? You could've given me a call. Come in...come in... Please sit. Brother, tell me. Anything important? They called us from the police station. And interrogated us. Then they returned Ramya's phone saying that they'd close the case. I wanted to let you know... And give you this phone. If you could make this work, I'll give this to the younger daughter. I'll get it done by tomorrow itself, brother. How is sister-in-law doing? She is still drowning in tears. She pampered her daughter for 21 years. Can she forget so easily? I couldn't believe Ramya is no more. Brother, please don't worry. We are all there for you. Did Ramya take this decision only because she didn't like the groom... ...or is there something else in your mind? For the past 6 months, she looked gloomy. She didn't talk much to anyone. She didn't tell anyone what she does and how much she earns. Since it doesn't seem good for our family... I decided to get her married and fixed this groom. She doesn't want to be a burden anymore and left us all. I'll take leave, Arul. Okay, brother. Get the phone ready, please. -I'll do, brother. Guna... Hey, Guna... -Here I'm coming, brother. Tell me. I told you to flash this phone but it's all still there. No need for that. Back up restore will retrieve all media and WhatsApp files, brother. Come on mam, come on. -Fresh prawns, come on. Only Rs. 200 per square mam. Give me both for 250 rupees. No, you can give. Give it. How much for the tiny prawns? This one? it's 100 rupees. Okay, then give a square of that. 350 rupees. Make it a total of 350. Add 50 rupees, mam. -It's okay... Pick the good ones. Don't add the rotten ones. Hey, come here. I've been watching you for a while, you are coming behind me. What do you want? You seem to be familiar, that's why... Will you start wooing a woman once you see her? What do you want now? Do you want to touch me? Here or there? -Mam, please wait. Touch me...touch me... -I'll handle, wait mam. Hey, who are you? If I hit you, you're done. I'm working in Sivan temple, Valikandapuram. Mam, he is a vagabond who fulfills his hunger by the temple offerings. I should never see you here, go away. I said, go away. Go away from here. -Yes, sir. I should never see you here again. Go away. Major sir, you had called for something important. What's the matter? Two days back, my niece committed suicide. Even you have come to that spot, sir. Yes, that case is closed. What's the problem with that now? Sir, I got the phone of my niece Ramya. When I was checking the WhatsApp... There is a message like this. Listen to this, please. -Ramya, even if you get married, you should not leave this profession. -If you deny, I have a video taken at the lodge, I'll leak out that. -Attend the client properly, go... Sir, this is a murder threat. Did you call that number? I did, sir. That number is out of service. Not only that, a day before she committed suicide... She was called to a specific address.... ...and was offered 3000 rupees for an hour in that message. So sorry to say this, sir. But their family looked so naive, sir. Tell the parents to file a complaint immediately. I'll myself proceed into this. Sir, it's very difficult. If I go to my brother's family and say your daughter has done brothel... …and I'm suspecting her suicide, they will not believe me, sir. Sir, I will myself investigate this case. I need your help for that, sir. Okay, I will inform the Inspector. But this is a very sensitive case, sir. Handle it carefully. That's all I need, sir. Thank you so much, I'll leave, sir. That house, brother. Who is this? We want to meet Nelson sir. Dad has gone upstairs for a walk. Oh, thank you. Let's go upstairs, brother. Mr. Nelson... Yes, sir. Who are you? My name... -He is Major Varma. YouTuber, Crime YouTuber. Sir, I've seen a lot of your videos. I'm your fan, sir. Nice meeting you. -Thank you, sir. Sir, I need a small help. Yes sir, I'll do. Have you seen this girl anywhere? I think so but don't know exactly. Who is this girl? Sir, four days ago, did you book to ******? I don't understand. Oh, no! Let me ask you frankly. Did you book for an escort? Sir, I'm talking out of respect for you. But he is talking bad. Leave from here immediately, sir. Sir, ignore him. It'd be great if you co-operate a little. No sir, what you speak doesn't sound good. I will call the cops. You... If your wife is away, will you call the young girls for your lust? Do you know that this girl committed suicide two days ago? Better you call the cops. I'll tell this whole truth to your wife. Sir, please... Sir...please don't. Hey, you call the cops. -Everyone is watching, sir. Sir, I'll tell you what happened. -That's good. Tell me. Since my children were on their holidays... ...my wife took them to her parents house for a week. Meanwhile, in an app called *****, I was looking around for girls to date. All of a sudden, I received photos of a few girls in WhatsApp... ...and asked to pay 3000 rupees for an hour, sir. I paid 3000 rupees and choose a girl named Ramya. But, the middleman told Ramya was busy... ...and instead brought some other girl. He cheated me, sir. I was okay and had been with her for an hour and sent her, sir. This is what happened, sir. But I don't know anything about the girl named Ramya that you mentioned. Oh, had the prostitution developed so much on online? Can you do me a favour? Call that middleman and say that your friend needs a girl... ...and he comes there itself and book an escort. I'll do, sir. Guna, book the girl with your number. Brother. Come, Rasu. You came on time as you said. If you could perfectly do the jobs I say... ...I'll recommend you to join the boss. Clean that tractor well. There's the hen's coop, clean it thoroughly. There are over 100 coconuts in the back, peel them off. Dear, bring the bag that we use to buy meat. Here I'm coming... I will go to Mettur and buy meat. Okay. Take his help to clean whatever you need to do. Okay. Don't come with complaints later, understood? Okay. Do whatever sister-in-law asks for. -Okay. Okay, brother. -Take care. Come. Take this bucket here and wash the tractor. Okay, mam. Why is he doing it repeatedly? I will bang him if I catch him. -I'll hit you, why did you add him on the conference call now? -I feel irritated to hear his voice. -Will someone pull this sort of trachery? -I'll talk anything to anyone I want. What's his problem? Rasu... Rasu... Brother. Hey, you've done a great job. You've cleaned everything well. Have it. Drink this and finish the rest, alright? Okay, brother. Brother... I need to tell you something. Please don't mistake me. What's it Rasu, tell me. Brother, while I was cleaning the house... ...your daughter was indulged in fuss with someone on the phone. It's like someone is threatening her. What? It's better to enquire at the beginning. That's why... What are you saying? Selvi...Selvi... What, dear? -Hey, Selvi.. Why are you yelling on her on a holiday? Where is she? She is Inside. -Call her. Selvi, come here. Who is threatening you on the phone? What's the problem for you? Brother... What's the problem? -Brother, calm down. Brother, ask her softly without being loud. Oh, are you the one who eavesdropped and opened up. Don't you have sense? Hey, you... -Brother... Dear, if you rely on someone else for your problem, It'll be a never ending one. These are your parents. They will only think good of you. Confide in them. What happened, tell me. That is... There's a team leader in the office I work. We shouldn't use cell phone in office hours. So, we use emails and WhatsApp in the office system to chat. He took screen recordings of my personal conversation with a close friend... ...and uses it asking me to do whatever he says. He threatens to leak it to all if I don't comply. What is it so personal that he uses it against you? Brother! It's common for their age to have such conversations. Does that mean he can threaten her? We shouldn't spare him, brother. Do as I say. Come...come, brother. Disgusting... -Come, I'll tell you, brother. Look here... Keep your phone on the shirt pocket. Switch on the background camera. Also, take it... This pendant has a mic attached in it. Once you step in, give this 3000 rupees to the girl. At least record till she removes her top attire. That's our evidence. Once everything is done, say the word "Attention". We'll come inside and arrest. Got it? Go, do it without any mess up. -I’m scared, brother. Go fast. You're asking me to go alone. -Damn it, go. Guna, don't worry. Welcome sir, welcome. What are you looking for? We have cotton, polyester... Mini skirt has come from Bombay, sir. What do you want? Actually, Nelson sir sent me. Oh, Nelson sir! He told me about you. Come in. All kinds are here, come in. Don't be shy. Come in, sir. We have options of all kinds. Choose anything of your choice. What, Rosy? -Sir, I'll go with her. Okay, sir. Come, sir. You have a great taste. Mam, have you seen? They have a separate room for this. Yes, sir. This is very shocking to me. Such a busy complex has this network concealed in it. She is an young girl. Be **** with her. All the best. Sit, I'll send her in. Give the money. Put on your top. "Attention" -Hey! Mam, let's go. Hi, Selvi. I'm suprised that you've called me to a reserved place like this. But, I'm sorry for threatening or scaring you. Please don't mistake me. I like you very much, Selvi. I had no other choice. You're looking so beautiful today. Anyway, just hug me, please. I am Selvi's father. She had told me everything what you did to her. Have you recorded her personal information? And it seems you are threatening her that you will leak it. Better give it back to her. Let it be an end today, else I'll lynch you. No sir, I'll delete everything. Selvi, come to office tomorrow. We'll discuss it there. Sir..Sir...Sir.... Sir..Sir... Leave me, sir. Sir...Sir...sorry sir. On your knees. -Sir... Now on your knees I said. -Sir... Let's blaze him, brother. No, sir. My daughter's life will be ruined if revealed out. Let's leave him, Rasu. Atleast let's cut off his limbs and legs, brother. Sir, please no... sorry, sir. I'll run away somewhere, Forgive and leave me, sir. I'll delete everything.. Please, sir. -Will you delete it? Are you dare to threaten? Will you delete it? What shall we do with him? This is enough for him, dad. Get up and flee from here. Hey, wait...You scoundrel... Rasu... Thank you very much, Rasu. I'll never forget this help of your's. Come home after 10 or 15 days. I'll definitely join you to my boss. Okay, brother. I'll leave then, Rasu. -Okay, brother. Greetings, mam. -Come sir, waiting only for you. Take this guy and complete the formalities. He'll give you a video. Collect it. Go. - Okay, mam. Come sir. Take your seat, sir. Hey, why do you have the vermilion bindi on forehead? Rub it off first. Doing illicit activities and showing off as if sacred. Sir, only if I show these gizmo, customers will rely on my honesty. Why do you talk with him, sir? Ignore him. Women are doing lot of works and are successful nowadays. Why did you resort to such ways? Even old women sell veggies and munchies for their livelihood. Have you not seen them? Why do you do this sort of work? Cool Raja is threatening you to do this business, right? He isn't threatening, mam. I'm doing this to overcome my difficulties. I have two younger sisters, mam. I can't even pay my fees. My father is a drunkard who drinks all day and touch my thigs in the night. Why would I choose this if my father was good? You look family oriented, what's your problem? Mam, I am an illiterate. I'm a widow. I was pushed to do this by the middleman who helped me to get pension for widows. They tricked me saying if I work for three hours… …they will give me 3000 rupees and they brought me here, mam. So, you're into this profession on your own will, right? Sir, I will take them before the Judge mam and send them to Government home. Can I talk with him, mam? Yes, sir. Come...come...all of you come. Hey, Cool, sit down. You know this girl, right? I know sir, she died recently. -Ramya, even if you get married, you should not leave this profession. -If you deny, I have a video taken at the lodge, I’ll leak that out. -Attend the client properly, go. I know this is not your voice. Who's voice is this? Sir, I've never heard this voice before.
