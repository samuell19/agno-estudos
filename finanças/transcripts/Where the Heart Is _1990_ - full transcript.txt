All right! Way to go! [ Warning Horn ] Armed. Clear. ? We shall overcome ? What do you want me to do? Get those pickets out! I've got a job to do. - What? - To hell with it! I just got off the phone with Jack. He said there's a possibility of picketers... picketing. Did he? ? Oh, deep in our heart ? - Did we get it? - Hang on a minute. - Yes! - Yes, we got it! We got it! It's absurd. A monstrosity like that by a third-rate architect. How was I to know the New York Times... would declare him a genius? They're turning this town into a tomb, Harry... making every rat-infested ruin into a monument. [ Stewart ] Yeah, keep the city safe for the cockroaches. - That's great! Terrific! - Please, go away. Okay. One more time for the camera. Okay, kids? Great, great. Is there any way to build around it? Sure! The tallest building in Brooklyn... with a little pimple on its bottom. Great idea. Good thinking. We saved the Dutch house! We saved the Dutch house! That's my daughter. Daphne? Daphne! Honey! You know I was understanding... when you stood up for the whales and the rain forests. How could you betray your own dad... for this broken-down Dutch toilet? I'm not with them. Mom sent me to tell you not to be late. Oh, yeah. It's just like something you would do. Right! We saved the Dutch house! May I? We saved the Dutch house. We saved the Dutch house. We saved the Dutch house. We saved the Dutch house. We saved the Dutch house. We saved the Dutch house. [ Yell ] What financial effect will this preservation order... have on your development? -Not now. -We don't have any comment at this time. ?[ Rock Music ] Dad, let me take the limo. I'll send it right back. That's out of the question, honey. [ Chloe ] It's raining. You want to ruin... the most important night of my life? It's my fault it's raining? I made you late? Thanks, Dad. I saw you on TV. Sorry. Come on,Jose. [ Chloe ] Jimmy, we're waiting, all right? [Jimmy ] Coming! Jimmy? The bike. Sorry, Dad. Acid rain is murder on the chrome. - Ah. - Saw you on TV. A victory for the committee... to save the city. [ Sigh ] Hey, who stopped the music? I did. Your dad, the laughingstock... of New York City. I stopped the music... forever! You're late, darling. - Are you ready? - No, not quite. Oooh. Well then... how -- How can I be late? [ Laughing ] Whoa! Come on. Come on. Well done, Lionel. Oh, you're here! Don't worry about the limo, Chloe. - We managed to find a cab. - Good. Your seats are down there. Good show, Lionel. Good color, texture. - Thanks. - That's my son. - Hi,John. - Did you catch Lionel's show? It was wonderful. How you doing? We're in time for our baby. For my degree work, I've made a film. I've developed a technique based on 18th century trompe l'oeil... which involves painting on the human body... mostly my own, and my sister Daphne's... whom I would like to thank. Okay. Go! Start it! ''The body is an infinite landscape... painted by the soul.'' Baudelaire. Wow. Your sister's even more -- You know... than I imagined. It's art, darling. You look. You don't have to understand it. [ Gasp ] ''People, paint, illusions.'' Chloe McBain. Education, I'm all for. God knows I've paid enough for it. All she's got to show for it is a pornographic film. At least she's normal. - You call that normal? - She's not a... you know... like my boy Lionel. Three white wines, please. - You paid for his education, right? - Right. Put him on the streets. That'll shape him up. He won't leave. He's got it too good at home. Half these parents... are the victims of the ''won't leave home'' syndrome. - How the hell can you get them out? - How? - Uh-huh. - With cunning and surprise. You harden your heart. Oh, God. He hated it. - They all hated it. - Not all. Some of them were just bored. Come on, I'm just kidding. They loved it. Congratulations. Oh... you were great. The most amazing man has offered me a contract... to produce my own collection. Can you believe it? That's great. How much is he paying you? Well, it doesn't work like that, Jimmy. They're giving me a huge cut of the profits. Lionel, great show. Chloe, amazing. What can I say? - Roll over Picasso. - Picasso? You never looked at a painting before you met Chloe. - Chloe's work has opened my eyes. - Flies! Aesthetically provocative... and stunningly sexy. Well now, how would you like... to create a calendar for a client of mine? An insurance company. - For money? - Quite a substantial amount. It's flattering... but I want to be a serious artist. Thanks. The most serious artists in New York... work in advertising. I'd say it's the only... true art of our time. Think about it, Chloe. Girls, you have the world at your feet. Try not to trip over it. Dad, we're crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. Crossing the river? Leaving Manhattan? - Hey,Jose, wrong way. - No, it's the right way. I'm putting you kids... on the straight and narrow. Do you love it? Ugly is ''in'' this year. Everybody just loves it. - Yeah, it's poetic. - Uh-huh. Like a flower stopping a tank. I'm glad you like it... 'cause I'm giving it to you kids. What? I guess we could fix it up with the right decorator. Dad, I don't think we're ready to live on our own. Think of it as a survival test. It'll be fun. You mean, it's only a game? It's a game, exactly... but with very strict rules, son. No designers. You'll do that yourselves. I'll give you money. I'll give you, say, $7 50 each. And the game will start... right now. - Right now? - Uh-huh. What do we do once we've used up the $7 50? I guess you'll have to use your wits. Think of ways to make money. I suppose... getting a job would be cheating? [Jimmy ] It doesn't sound like a game. It sounds like real life. It's an adventure. You'll have your own place... - do whatever you want. - Wait. Play that music as loud as you like! It'll be great, just great. You can't spoil us, then stop when it suits you. Mom? You're being unreasonable, Stewart! They can't move in right away. That house is a ruin! [ Whistle ] Come on, children. Let's go home. Get in the car, Jean. I will not abandon my children. Just get in the car. Home, Jose. I have no interest in playing this game! - Someday you kids will thank me. - I will not! Come on, Jose, come on! I covered for you. Mom, who's gonna curl your hair? [ Harry ] Listen to what I'm saying, Hamilton. Stewart has made demolition an art. Trust this guy. Give him a little time. He's more stable than people give him credit for. My company has destroyed more buildings than World War II. I have the capacity to flatten Manhattan. Your expertise is not at issue. If you can't develop this site... you're stuck with an enormous loan. The meter is running on the interest. What you're really saying... is your bank is stuck with me, right? Oh, boy. Well, the way I feel... I'd like to tear this place apart... with my bare hands! Why don't we bulldoze it? Pay the fine? Take the heat? Let's do it! Then what? They'd withdraw our building permits for the tower. You've got squatters. [ Stewart ] They're all mine. Chloe, there are three dirty old men staring in at us... and one of them is our father. Act like we're having a great time. It'll drive him crazy! [Jimmy ] Fun, fun, fun. - ?? [ Humming ] - [ Ape Noises ] Can you believe that boy dropped out of Harvard... not out of a tree? I'll report him to the bureau of child welfare... then maybe Mother would leave him. He'd be left a lonely old man. [ Chloe ] Serve him right. He's gone. Did you see the look on his face? We should do something he'll never forgive himself for. He'll make us sweat, then we'll be back at the house... - same as ever. - But just a little more humble. - I'll never eat humble pie. - It's Mother! - What did I say, huh? -She's come for us. They kick us out, and they're still swarming all over us. He really means it this time. I think we've been outmaneuvered. I almost wept when I saw your empty rooms. We wept when we saw the empty rooms here. I thought you said you couldn't wait to move out. You didn't believe us, did you? It was just to scare you. Chloe! This is my pile. You organize your own pile. Daphne, it's only a pile. Maybe, but it's the only pile I have. That pile... is my past. At least you still have your toys, Jimmy. This is not a toy. This is my future. This is the future of the world. Remember, Chloe... you copied this during your semester in Paris. How can you... remind me of Paris when we're stuck in Brooklyn? [Jean ] You managed there, you'll manage here. [ Whining ] Daphne, don't be such a baby! I'm not crying for myself, but for all the people... who've done this for us all of our lives: Mary and Mrs.Jose... even Mom once or twice. Hey, we've got a live one! Aaah! Sh--! Yee-ha! I was so happy studying... psychology and human resources. All I wanted was to become trained... so I could help the homeless. How can I study this crap... when I desperately need help myself? Dad told you, if you want to help homeless... go into the construction business. [ Radiator Sputters ] It's warm. - No, no, all mine. - Get off. - Boarders! - Boarders? Oh, wow! No. [ Chloe ] I guess I'll have to prostitute myself. - Keep that as a last resort. - My art, not my body. - [ Doorbell ] - I'll have to do that stupid calendar. You make me feel so ashamed, Chloe. [ Hooker ] You want to rent rooms, or what? I guess I could go out there and do something. Don't say it. I'm going. It's me. It's on the bicycle. Find job. Out door. Sorry. Excuse me. Take mine. I don't want it. Thank you. Sorry! Great. That's a lot of paint, lady. Yeah. Thanks a lot. It sure is. You blew the last of our money! I can't paint without paints. I don't get paid until I deliver the calendar... which is 12 large paintings away. We're out of money, and no one in their right mind... is gonna rent a room in this rat hole! Here's what we have to do. We each talk a friend into boarding with us. - Right. - Right now. American Demolition? I'll look into that. No, the timing's right. The stock is down after that Dutch house disaster. One of our clients is trying to raid your father's company. -We want you to rent a room in the house. -That slum? You said your stepmother wanted you out. I was thinking about a penthouse, not a flophouse. But you see, your room will be next to Chloe's. I'll take it. Not you, not at that price. Let me in! I want to come home! I don't like it there! Mommy? You've got to be strong, Jean. That's the only way they'll learn. Daddy? Daddy? I just want to come in for a little while, Daddy. Coffee? Daphne? Honey, no. This is not right. - Daphne, Daphne? - This is not -- Daphne, my baby! This hurts me worse than it does you. If that were true... you'd be screaming in agony! You should be ashamed of yourself. You should report these people. They're bad parents! The neighborhood should run them out of town. Look what they've done. Yes, I belong to this house. Yes, 7-8-7. These are my parents! I live here. Yes, report them. [ Yell ] How did I let you charm me into this? Don't forget it's a landmark. Maybe you could put it on your label... like a French chateau wine. Nothing but mud... ruins. Who's gonna take me seriously in a dump like that? I would. I would if I didn't know you so well. That hat's a Manhattan hat. I can't wear it over there. [ Gasp ] Huh? Do it. If you're gonna do it, do it. The suspense is killing me. - I'm waiting for the tide. - Yeah? I don't want to wade through that smelly mud. You could always jump off the bridge. No, I can't. I'm scared of heights. If it's for love, don't do it. The pain's bad, but only lasts 12, 14 days. Believe me. - I'm punishing my father. - Uh-huh. You make sure there's someone... reliable around to fish you out. Oooh, look at that. [ Chuckle ] There she goes. - You're a magician? - Eh, hmm... a lifetime of deceit. Look... I have to find a friend... to live in our house. I wonder, sir... - would you teach me magic if-- - If what? - [ Video Game Noise ] - I need some better running sounds. -[ Crash ] - Okay, I'll hold you there for a sec. Down, down. Now running and backgrounds. Running, running. Bye, little buddy, I got to pee. Do it! [ Groan ] Whoa! Ow! -Jimmy, are you okay? - No! You never said we'd have Bang-fucking-kok in the hallway. That's an unprovoked racist slur. Excuse me, we are from Bom-fucking-bay! This has nothing to do with Porna and Mya. Okay, let's zero in on the rent here. [ Daphne ] Anyway, fashion is bad ecology. It makes us hate what we are wearing... and buy things we don't want. At my age, I need an hour in the bathroom in the morning! There's always one of them skinny... titless mannequins in there... fluffing up her hair. Pay your rent, and you can shit all day. He'll pay, once he's worked up his magic act. I'm working on getting him some engagements right now. You're so ungrateful. I've given you 7-and-a-half percent of my couture business. A percentage of zip is zilch. You all agreed that I could defer my rent for 2 months... until my collections are ready. The only tenant that's come across here is my friend, Tom. He doesn't have to be so smug. Yes, I do. We're broke, desperate, and hopeless. The fag and the Shit don't pay. - Don't call him ''the fag.'' - Or ''the Shit.'' At least I'm the Shit. You're just a shit. You're a slum landlord harassing his tenants. When I sell my video game -- [ Doorbell ] I'm Sheryl Corman. I'm here about the room for rent. You better know right off... this establishment only accepts cash... three months in advance. We have official landmark status. Three months in advance? What are you talking about? I don't care. I'll give you six months if you like. The karma here is major. 15 people achieved glossolalia in this house in 1935. Glasso-what? Glossolalia, speaking in tongues. I'm researching it for my master's... ''The Paranormal in Religion.'' Oh, yeah. Yeah. ?[ Tango Music ] Quick. I'm getting in touch on so many levels... it's awesome. Can you feel those amazing frequencies? Every time I touch you, I can feel it. Yeah. I thought you were Chloe. Sisters. We're the same, but different. Different? In what way different? Oh, I don't know. I guess you'll have to find out for yourself... won't you? This is the real nervous system of the planet. My brain is connected to half the world through this... just by plugging in and punching a few keys. See, we're doing the same thing. It's just our equipment that's different. Let's just keep it cerebral... shall we? [ Howl ] ?[ Quiet Pop Music ] Sell... before the market closes. [ Whistle ] We made the most of Sheryl's rent. Bills all paid... and enough left over for this decadent celebration. A brief pause on the road to damnation. - Broke again, and can't get laid. - Aww. If we can just somehow... stay afloat for a month... until Chloe and I finish our projects. There is a way out of this nightmare... - and you know it, Jimmy. - No. Sell your soul to save your sisters. - Work for Dad? Never. - Mm-hmm. No. I'm serious. - No. - Yes. - How's the great dictator? - Dictating. It's a letter to the New York Times. Can you sneak me in? We're expecting the real estate developers... who are supposed to buy the Dutch site from us. He's gonna try to convince them to build around it. Thanks. - Turning this city into a museum is -- - [ Knock ] Jimmy. What brings you here, son? Dad, I've been doing some serious thinking. I'd like to come back and work for you. Oh? You've suddenly developed a passion for demolition? Well, I like bulldozers, Dad... but I'm still not in love with them. What do you have to offer? I'll computerize the business... - modernize the place. - No. I've got computers coming out the ass. But you don't love them, you just put up with them. Did your sisters put you up to this? Mmm. Huh? Kind of. I'm sorry, son. Nice try. So, was there something else? Challenge you to slap. Slap. I win, I get a job. Oh, Jimmy, please. You've never won yet. There will come a time. Yeah, right. You're getting old. [ Chuckle ] ''Getting old''? Come on. I'd say you just made your first deal. Let's go. Whoop, fall. Toro. Yeah, toro! Yeah! Ol?, ol?! You're dying. You are a dead man. - Unbelievable! - You cheated! [ Tom ] I want to switch. Come on. No way. Unbelievable. - Hello. - Hello, Daph. - Hello, Daph. Don't call me ''Daph.'' You can call me ''Daph,'' Tom. Jimmy's got this great new game coming along. What about Dad? [Jimmy ] I fell on my face. [ Daphne ] That's terrible! We don't need Dad. I've sold Tom a piece of my video game for cash. If I can get hooked on it... there must be a million like-minded idiots... dying for the same fix. Well, let's see how the market's doing. [ Tom ] It's a much easier game to play... and everybody wins. Well, almost everybody. All you boys can think about is playing video games. The whole world... is falling apart... around us. Station three, clear. - Arming. - Arm detonators. Stewart, news. - The Dutch house? - No, better. Bona fide takeover bid. A raider... is offering our stockholders 20% above market price. That's great. All I need is a proxy fight. We've got to consider it... with so many of your assets tied up in the Dutch house site. Bastards. Wall Street! Smart-ass bastards... buy up companies... kick out the professionals who built them up... sell off the assets, and leave them in ruins. Capitalism's going in the toilet. - All clear. - All clear. We have to notify the stockholders. I'll buy the stocks back myself. - You don't have the money! - I can raise it. - Firing. - Firing. Nobody destroys what I built up. Poetry. Sheer poetry. [ Daphne ] I always have these great urges to destroy things. - Do you think it's hereditary? - Hmm. Is it genetic... these destructive impulses? Hmm. Why am I January? Why am I notJune? Is it because I'm cold and bleak? That's it, isn't it? That's why I freeze out all the boys. Hmm. I'm glad I'm not you, Chloe. I'd bore myself to death. You're definitelyJanuary, Daphne. Perfect. Great. Oh. I'm sorry. - Hi. - Hi. [ Laugh ] A bit risque for an insurance company calendar, isn't it? It's a risk I'll have to take. You can't take out insurance against failure in art. I never consider the possibility... of failure. You're stuck, aren't you? Me, stuck? I guess I'm stuck. Lovely. Mmm. [ Daphne ] Wonderful. - Beautiful. - I did those today. They're just roughs, scratches. I suppose they are. Suppose they're what? Roughs, scratches... but lovely scratches. Really? They're just a bit Joan Collins-y. Hmm? What do you mean, ''Joan Collins-y''? Well -- What do you know about fashion? They'd look lovely on our mother, Lionel. That's very hurtful... and not at all helpful. Why is she so touchy? I never told you this... but I thought your show was so amazing. You're an original. You should make things that you like... not what you think other people like. Don't you think? Hmm? I can't think... when you're smothering me like this. Oh, Lionel. ? Ba-da-da dum-bum ? ? Ba-da-da dum-bum ? Whoo-hoo, Shitty! Wakey-wakey. Shitty, wake up. It's 2:00... and I have a lovely cup of coffee for you. [ Gasp ] Go back to your own planet! This one's all used up. What's to get up for? You don't see nothing but empty-brained idiots... spraying aerosol cans at their armpits... punching holes in the ozone layer. Looks like I might live to see the end of the world. They won't miss us when we blow ourselves up. Well, we know all that... but while we're waiting for the end... you have to find a way to pay your rent. - Nobody wants my old tricks anymore. - You have a gift. [ The Shit ] Your brother is the real magician of today... with that Pandora's box ofhis. Floppy disks, megabytes... I.B.M. compatible. Mine eyes have seen the true magic of the age. Don't move. Remember,you're adrift in a wild storm. Great. Thanks. [ Sigh ] I guess it just takes a little time... to get used to... this silence. I'll never get used to it. Ah, peace at last. I don't miss them. You never really knew them, Stewart. You were always working. Oh, really? What's that you're working on, huh? Who's this? Who's that? I was there. - Sweetheart? - What? Don't you think we should have a little peek in on them... just to see if they're all right? Jean, you've got to stay away. They've got to do it on their own. [ Sigh ] I'm under enough pressure as it is. I cannot stand these silent accusations of yours. [ Crying ] I can't breathe here. I can't breathe! [ Crying ] ?[ Soft Rock Music ] [ Chloe ] It doesn't matter, Daphne. At least we have each other... which is more than most people have. Most people wouldn't want us. We almost have each other. Jimmy almost has Sheryl. [ Tom ] I almost have Chloe. [ Chloe ] Dream on, sweetheart. - Hi? - Hi. Excuse me. Who are you? Distant relative. - Hi. - Hi. I think that your father was just here. Jimmy, it's 1 0:30. I've been up for hours. Patch into the Reuter feed. Yeah, okay. Your father's stock was going through the roof. I bought a bunch myself before the raiders moved in. It just went up another point. Yeah, whoo! If it's up another point, then buy, Harry. What do you think? Lionel designed it. Is it right for the White House? It's white. I guess it's right. I feel so twitchy about meeting the president. Just be yourself. That's the last person I want to be. I just don't understand... why you have to borrow money from the bank... to buy back your own business. And now you want me to sell my beautiful house in Connecticut. Jean, I am not selling the house. I'm using it for collateral. If worse comes to worse... I will sell the stocks, pay off the bank loan... and redeem the deed to the damn house. Okay? Bizarre of them to give you this honor... just when things are going so wrong for you. I'm not gonna argue with you. This is my money. I earned it. - I bought this house for you. - Now you want it back. You got it. Well, then, say you love me. How do you know you're in love with me? What is it about me that you like? Come to think of it... I don't like anything about you. I'm just hopelessly in love with you. - That's not right. - Oh. Can we try again tomorrow? Fine with me. I love when your brush caresses my body. Eyes. Great. You've disappeared. Help. Okay. [ Sigh ] Ladies and gentlemen, the president will be here shortly. When you shake his hand for the press photos... grasp it lightly. The president has a touch of tennis elbow. I'm gonna remind him that we've gotta stay dynamic... or we're dead. Tear down the old and build up the new... just like we always have. I might be the guy to tell him that. You think he saw that letter of mine in The Times? Just say, ''Mr. President, this is a great honor.'' He'll probably ask you how you got started in demolition. ''I started by blowing up bridges in Korea, Mr. President... and I just couldn't shake the habit.'' That always gets a laugh... and you wouldn't be lying. What would you say? - If I were receiving an award? - Yeah. ''I richly deserve this, Mr. President. ''For 25 years, I've tried to keep things together... ''while he destroyed everything around him. ''And finding out that after the children were gone... we had absolutely nothing to say to each other.'' Jean, sweetheart. Ladies and gentlemen... the President of the United States of America. ?[ Drum Roll ] [ TV] New York's finest were honored yesterday... at a White House ceremony for captains of industry. Among them was Stewart McBain. How could Dad wear that tie? - That dress is so -- - Don't. - Dad, tell him! - Every dog has his day. I'm an anarchist. I refuse to look at politicians. Your mother looks so proud... and your father must be completely out ofhis... [ Sigh ] skull. Stewart's brownstone, value $3 million. Connecticut house, a million and a half. Plus his 29%... of American Demolition. [ Harry ] Plus, plus, plus. Plus, plus. I'm just counseling you not to buy back your stock... not while you're so upset. The stock is undervalued, Hamilton. The property... is the reason the prick is trying to steal it from me. Who knows what's going to happen to property values? You've got collateral coming out your ass. The computer doesn't like the deal. Who's running this bank... you or those little green numbers? [ Hamilton ] Computers. They're getting out of hand, Stewart. Impulses, flashing around the globe. We'rejust neurons in a big neurotic brain. You're losing your mind, Hamilton. Ah-ha. How you doing, asshole? I'm losing my mind? Why don't you just come here and sign the approval? Oh, Jesus... I can't believe my luck. ''Buy American Demolition. American Demolition. ' Something, something. ''American Demolition.'' Tom, here. Buy me 1 ,000 American Demolition. I think it's going north again. Yeah, I'll find the money. American Demolition. I'm buying! American Demolition! Yeah. Tom, I got my man on the line. Stewart's still slugging it out with the raider. Damn, is he mega-stubborn. Tom, the raider's getting ready to unload. You better be quick. Sell American Demolition. What's the story here? Let's share the wealth. Start selling American Demolition. Three weeks until Lionel finishes his collection. - How long to go on the calendar? - About the same. We're not gonna make it on what we've got. People can tell if you don't have money. They look at you as if you smell bad. Hmm. It's not only what it can buy. Just having it is sexy. I mean, even Tom. Is he getting to you? I can raise his rent. Don't you dare. If he even suspected it, he'd be totally unbearable. Don't you look just darling? -So do you. - Thank you. Come on. Hmm. Hold on a minute. Don't do anything nasty while you're wearing that halo. [ Marcus Moans ] [ Cheryl ] Yes. -Ahh. - Yes. Ahh. I'm growing weary over these chains, Daphne. Don't lose heart, Shitty. Get this number down and we can take it to Vegas. - Sheryl back? - Mm-hmm. Oh, don't! - Yes. -Ah, ahh. - Oh,yes. -Ahh. - Ahh. - Coffee, Sheryl? Yes, oh, yes. Yes,yes. Coffee? Yes, oh, yes. Sugar? Is there anybody there? Who? People spoke in tongues in this house. Can you see if you can reach one of them? It's no good. I just can't get it on. Oh. Oh. Are you taking me for a ride? I wouldn't mind. [ Groan ] I thought they were -- They weren't. They were just talking in tongues. [ Laughter ] Looks good. Very good. Tom, would you padlock my wrists? I've got to make a call. - American Demolition still collapsing? - It's in ruins. I bailed out at the right time. [ Raspy Laughter ] [ Chloe ]Just point the arrow at her heart. Olivia... could you chain me real tight? Well, I'm much better with a whip. Oh, you little vixen, you. [ Doorbell ] Will you be okay? I won't be a moment. [ Doorbell ] Mother! [ Giggle ] Mom? Chloe. How dare you hit my mother! That's what you do for hysteria! [ Gasp ] [Jean ] This is all I have left in the world. I gave everything else I had... - to poor Mrs.Jose. - What? We've lost everything... and I can't reach your father. - He's ruined. - That's it? Do you understand this? Yeah, I do, perfectly. Then explain it to us. Well... it's like this. A raider bought stock in your father's company. He was trying to buy it out, but your father outbid him... pushing the stock way up. When this raider realized he couldn't take over... he sold all his stock, taking a big profit... as did others... myself included. That left your father... holding a lot of stock at an inflated price. Then came an article in the Wall StreetJournal... about how this house was holding up development. That started a stampede of selling. And then... I guess that's when the bank stepped in. They took over your father's stock... and all his assets. And they collected all the collateral. My beautiful house in Connecticut. 1 2 floppy disks... a life's work. It's all yours, Hamilton. The bank would appreciate it if you would run the business... until we liquidate, or whatever we have to do. No, no. I just don't see myself working for a bank. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Where are you going? - I'm down... and I'm going out. Down and out. All the chains have fallen away: desk chains, job chains. Free... I go naked into the world. Please, don't go! I'm going now. I'm leaving you all everything: the debts, the doubts, the despair. [ Crying ] Oh, my dear. If I didn't screw you... believe me, I meant to. Don't leave me. Your loyalty was an accusation. Blame someone else. As for the rest of you... take care of yourselves. I won't be able to do that anymore. Farewell. Good luck to you. God bless you. What are you all staring at? Get back to work! He walked out. Okay, I'm head of the family. I'll think of something. - I can't think of anything. - I'll help out. We'll manage without you. You betrayed the family! [ Chloe ] I hope I never see you again. You wait. You'll come crawling. I don't think so. I might, Tom. What are you talking about? We're broke. Only the rich can afford principles. This is so unfair. I was just moving money around. Well, I guess... you'll all have to look for jobs now. - [ Gasp ] - [ Scream ] - Where's the key? - I swallowed it. Swallowed the key? Let's hope it opens your bowels. [ Cough ] [ Sigh ] I'm sorry, but without Stewart... all we can do is fire the employees... and sell off the assets, which includes this house. We refuse to leave. There's an eviction order ready to be served. I am so worried about your father... walking out like that. It's his pride. Humiliation doesn't bother me. Did he say where he was going? ''Down and out,'' and ''free of his chains.'' That's a quote. We've gotta find him and take care of him. No money. No home. He's joined the ranks of the lost and forgotten. They'll soon know the whereabouts of a new... recruit. [ Knock ] Anybody here... who can give a little advice? I'm a vagrant now. - What the -- - Oops. Starting out, new to it. I'll talk to anybody. Hey! Hey... what's the matter with you? You want a box? It'll cost you $5. I'll give you $3. - $5! - Hold it. That's better. How can he sleep in a box like this? Your father always insisted on a king-size bed. Mom, look. He's got hooked up with Marvin X. I know his haunts. He scavenges the dumps, begs at The Roseland... and favors a soup kitchen down on the Lower East Side. You want to split up? Yeah, okay. We'll split up. Oh, Shitty! You'll be fine, baby. You'll be fine. Hey! [ Marvin X ] Loosen up, man. You got culture shock, that's all. My life's over. I can see that now. I'm on the scrap heap. I am on the scrap heap. You done big things. [ Marvin X ] A lot of great men die young. They do their thing quick and get out of here. No. That's him. There he is! Get the door. Stewart, darling! Stewart -- Wait a minute. Excuse me. Hey, it's me. It's you. [Jean ] Shitty! Shall we have a quickie? Pardon me. - Thanks, man. - It's good to see you. [ Singing And Chanting ] [ Babble ] She's saying, ''God needs your dollars. [ Babble ] And he needs them now.'' [ Babble ] [ Laughter And Babbling ] [ Chanting ] [ Preacher ] You in the back! Yes, you! You with the chicken leg in your hands! Come forward. Do what I say! Come. Come forward, brother. Speak your heart out, brother. Speak from my heart? Home is where the heart is. Yes. I lost my home. Lost his home. I lost my family, too. I'm probably losing my mind. I'll tell you something, brother. These chicken feathers, that's not the answer. You can't beat... those chicken-shit corporate raiders with chicken feathers. He's speaking in tongues! ?? [ Swing Music ] It's been years. I've forgotten the steps. Your head has... but your heart hasn't. Oh, Stewart! There, now, Mr. McBain. It's the solstice. Full moon. You must be a Taurus. I'll take you home now. ?[ Sitar Music ] [ Gasp ] No, no, no. [ Chanting ] [ Chanting ] [ Video Game Sounds ] Are you feeling yourself again, Mr. McBain? [ Chloe ] You look better than you did yesterday... half dead and babbling. Speaking in tongues, probably. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? My offspring? Daddy, look. Mine? [ Daphne ] I've decided to forgive you. Look at this. Come on. Come on, Dad. Over here. All right. Now, now... you press here... and try to stop me from demolishing your building. Try to get your man out of the crumbling building... while I try to destroy your exits. That's the Taj Mahal. Dad, it's just a game. I got the idea from you: demolition. Here we go. I thought you'd like it. [Jimmy ] Got ya! Oh, Jesus! - Jesus! - [ Gasp ] - I'm crushed! - Stewart! Try to rest, Stewart. It's nothing serious. Just a nervous breakdown. Everything's broken down: the values, the family... America, honest labor. - Everything I've stood for is broken down, gone! - Oh, sweetie. Don't worry about any of that stuff. - What? - Sorry. There's not a single thing that any one of you would fight for... not a single cause. - [ Mumble ] - Well, um... - there's the bald eagle, - Yes. But I wouldn't fight for it. - I'm a pacifist. - There must be something. I just can't think of it right now. [ Doorbell ] I can read you like a book... and you're still a stranger. [ Doorbell ] - Yeah? - McBain? Shh, my father is sleeping. Hey! Writ for eviction duly served. Good morning. Thank you. I won't budge, and that's that! I show my collection in a week. We'll all be rich. Even if we hang in here, we're still broke. Maybe the insurance company... - will give me an advance for the calendar. - I better find Tom. - We don't need charity from that traitor! - Yes, we do! Shh. Try to imagine huge blowups of your calendar... right here in the lobby. You're cutting down all the forests... - and planting the trees indoors. - What? It's something my sister says. By the way... how's my son, Lionel? He's making some lovely dresses. Not wearing them, I hope. [ Chloe ] January is earthquakes. February... bolt out of the blue or maybe broken hearts. April's a flooded room: Water damage. And December is, um... broken windows. And, um, July could be -- Absolutely brilliant... is what it is. They all relate to insurance. It's the environment. It's nature. It's us. I love the clever suggestion of lurking disaster: earthquake, fire, flood... snake bite. And remember... you fellas have got a first on this. ''Acts of God. Only we insure against them.'' I need an advance to finish the sequence. If you could -- I don't see that as being an insuperable problem. Do you... - [ Whisper] - Homoshimo-san? The market has crashed. - How bad is it? - Let's get out of here. I'll run down to the floor. Let's hope it's not another black Monday. No, you don't! I've groveled. We're broke. Your own son is starving! We've all got our problems. You have a contract. They've got to pay you. Let me go! [ Shouting ] You been sniffing something? Come home. All is forgiven. We need your money, and you need us. The bottom has dropped out of the market. I'm wiped out! I'd slit my wrists if I could afford a razor... and you're looking to borrow money from me? - What'd you do that for? - Hysteria. You did it to my mom. [ Tom Laughs ] As the stock market continues in turmoil... fights are breaking out between the dealers. Is this the end of capitalism as we know it? Sheryl,you find it easier... to talk to paranormals than to normals... because real people aren't real for you. You can't relate because you've got no relations. My God, you've seen right through me. You see, I taught her how to fake it... but it turns out she has a genuine gift. Well, anyway... as a finale... I plan to do... a little levitation. I knew it! Everything is possible in this house. It's -- Wait a minute. [ Chuckle ] Heh-heh-heh. I don't know who you are... but I'm gonna shave your face. My parents divorced when I was nine. Families confuse me. I just can't handle relationships. Think of a wheat field... swaying in the breeze. I've never seen you looking... quite so calm, Stewart. Beaten, I think is a better word. Don't say that. Well... I couldn't even make it as a bum. Why are you smiling? No feelings of guilt? No sense of regret? Shame? Remorse? You can't provoke me, Jean. All the anger is gone, too. What are you going to do? Whatever I'm told. You? Do what you're told? I kicked them out, they took me in. I'll do what I'm told! Porna, Mya, please? No way, no way! Gimme a week for the sake of Allah, or whomever. Porna, Mya, please? Please? The stock market's crashed again. - He's out of it. - He's out of it? What about me? They wouldn't pay. [ Crying ] What? How humiliating. [ Stewart ] You get out... of my house, you Judas bastard! Your house? It's more mine... with all the useless shares I have in American Demolition! You little swine! You ruined me! - I tried to save you and it ruined me! - Save me? I thought your stock had hit bottom. I spent every dollar to buy it up... to keep the business in the family. Now with the crash, it's worthless. I don't understand... but I'm very touched. Daphne? Well? Come on, snap out of it. You know I can't hypnotize to save my life. Oooh! I feel great! Isn't life wonderful? Yes. I don't have to do anything. Oh, but, let's do something. Lionel? If we all pitched in, could you get your show ready? I can sew. So what? So can I. - What? - Sew. You'd... do that for me? We'll sew our hearts out. Well, um... how about Chloe's calendar? We'll all finish that, too. Why don't we do the whole show here in the barn? Can I be a part of this? I'll pitch in. Yes! Gosh, somebody tell me what to do... I'll do it. Tell me what to do and I'll do it. I'll do it, by God, I'll do it! I'm kinda all tied up here. Sheryl? - Right over there. - All right. I got it. Get outta here! ...and I clung to your neck... and you swam miles out to sea. I wasn't afraid because you were... the strongest daddy in the world. When that wave came and hit us... and swept me away from you... even as I was drowning... I still trusted you. When you finally plucked me out of the sea... I saw fear on your face. Then I was afraid. That's the last of the film. [ Sighs ] That's it, 1 1 months out of 1 2. Just one more and all that money waiting for us. At least we finished it. We know it's beautiful. Yes, but I want the world to know... that it's beautiful. If we could just afford a venue, a runway... and models to show it. So near and yet so far. You know... if we all took jobs for a couple weeks... we could put that money together. Next. Bulldozers. Not at your age! I have a high-explosives license... and a vengeful nature. - Your experience? - I'm a buyer. - What stores have you bought for? - Most of them: from them, not for them. Daphne McBain, magician's assistant... fortune telling, E.S.P. - You read minds? - Yeah. Then I don't have to tell you what vacancies I've got. No, you don't. - What is this? - Eviction. - This is America. Don't we have rights? - Not without money. There's obviously been a computer error. Don't blame the computer. Who the hell do you think you are? Gee! A man can't even ask a question. - You were very brave. - Thank you. I just slipped. Compulsory 8-count. This is more than I can stand. It's the third house I've lost in a week. You have been evicted. Accept it. I can accept it. Wait! You bastard! [ Yell ] Ow! Oh, no, my tarot cards. It's all right. My collection is safe. Anyone got a wrench? Chloe, what are we gonna do? We'll pick up our things and go. Stay with a friend. I wouldn't dream of deserting you in your hour of need. [ Stewart ] She has no friends, only relations. Let's load the trailer. Lionel, couldn't your father help us? My father was wiped out by the crash, too. I can't believe they haven't repossessed the Porsche. I'm gonna lean on that son-of-a-bitch Hamilton! He dumped us in the streets! - He is obligated to take us in. - Go, brother! Hamilton... where do you think you're going? Margot's thrown me out of the house. Why? The bank fired me for backing lunatic schemes like yours. The computer identified me as... ineffective. Wait a minute. You better come with us. [ Daphne ] They better give us rooms. We pay taxes for these shelters. [ Stewart ] I pay taxes, sweetheart. They owe me! [ The Shit ] No way am I gonna set foot there. Why do you think every self-respecting... down-and-out sleeps in the streets? He doesn't relish the idea ofbeing... knifed and raped in a welfare shelter. Now, Stewart's got a box... but not the rest of you. This is a well-established, down-and-out community. We will not be overrun... by some penniless fly-by-nights. Rain's not enough? A tempest now! Dad, the Dutch house... is structurally unstable, right? Yeah. So? Do you think a storm like this could -- Knock it down? - I got it! - With a little help. Do you still have the keys to the explosive store? Oh, Stewey! Yes, by God! Yes! Yes! I loved that house. You hated it. Chloe, think of your beautiful paintings. They're just backgrounds. What matters is on film. - We're gonna pull it off. I feel it. - That's a damn cop. [ Tom ] No one will notice the explosions with this thunder. - Come on. - Now it comes down to it... I don't know whether I have the stomach. - One last shot, Dad. - I don't know. Dad, look at us. Stewart, it solves everything. With the house gone, the site can be sold... the bank paid off. I'll be exonerated. Tom's stock will be worth something. - The country house? - Yes, Jean will get her house back. Anything coming to me... I want split between Harry and the workers. Mine goes to the family. - Your family? - Your family. Man! Here goes nothing! [ Loud Thunder ] How do you like this storm? It just blew a house down. Dad? That was your masterpiece. [ Chloe ] It has to do with the sadness... that all things pass away... and how Manet captured on canvas... one of those fleeting... perfect... moments... in life. Yeah, I guess it was. I guess this is, too, huh, Jimmy? It was. As soon as you say it... it isn't. [ Chuckle ] Well, that completes my calendar, folks. Oh. [ Sigh ] Can I take these clothes off? - Can I put mine on? - Yes. You have the most perfect pair -- - I mean, they're a perfect match! -Jimmy! I was kidding. Just stop. Is it over? Nobody ever tells me anything. Ahh!Jimmy! Jimmy, pick on someone -- Pick on me, pal, okay? Come on, let's go. Yeah? Right now. Oh-oh-oh! Tom is a genius getting back the deed for the house. Chloe, that is lovely! Debts paid off and enough cash to get by. I thought The Shit was the greatest con artist. It's the art of business. I'm an artist, too. Oh. Here you go. What's the matter, pal? You slipped? Daphne! Come back here! You come here this instant! Come back here! Son, I'm sorry. I owe you an apology. Daphne! -It's gonna be an ecology zone, isn't it? -Solar heating. - No aerosols? - Organic vegetables. - All spare cash to the homeless? - Yeah, okay. - Promise? - I promise. One thing we've learned... we need a lot less than we used to. Can you concentrate? Concentrate. This is a mess! Girls, in 2 hours... the biggest buyers from New York will be here. Can you concentrate? Daphne... I just saw the light. You mean, the answer, the truth? Just the light falling in a certain way. Yes, but what does it all mean? Why does the light fall in a certain way? What's the point of life? The point is moments like this. This is it? We're not getting ready for something? We're just getting ready for nothing? I think it's a rehearsal. For another life? For a fashion show. Dad. Hmm, Daphne, hmm. Oh, please let them like it. This is a remarkable collection. I'm so impressed. I'm buying for all my stores. Walking on air, Olivia. Hmm, life's just a game to that kid. But he takes his games very seriously. Perhaps that's the answer, sweetheart. Sheryl, I'm crazy about you. All I can think about is you. I -- I can't even... look at another girl. Jimmy, I'm very fond of you, too. I think you're funny, you're cute... but you're so immature. If you could just grow up. Olivia, I'm crazy about you. All I think about is you. I can't look at another girl. I love you, too, Jimmy. You do? Now this boy's a bit of an asshole. - Reminds me of myself at his age. - I don't think... he'll be like you when he's your age. I think he'll be really nice. I'm making an effort in that direction. Thank you. You think I'm doing this for my own ego? I appreciate your doing it for me. Chloe, stop, I'm doing everything... - for Daphne. - Ah, Daphne. - Chloe. - Hi. Is that all there is? All this work? That's it? It's always more fun to get ready than to arrive. Too bad Lionel's gay. Hmm. Chloe, um... I'm not gay. I know you're miserable. No. I'm not... that way. Well, what way are you? I'm a... closet heterosexual. I was afraid nobody would take me seriously... in the fashion world if I were straight. The fact is, I'm crazy about you. Oh! Oh, God, Lionel. I'll have to adjust to that... but I think I'm gonna like it. - Will you have me? - Of course, I will. - Are you sure. - Sure, I'm sure. I am so happy! We'll have to work at it 4, 5 hours a day. When we're not dancing, you'll be sewing sequins. We'll win every over-45's in the land! Your mother is... a beautiful woman. - I love you. - Are you sure you're not making a mistake? I've made plenty of those... but this is not one of them. I'd better grab a chair before the music stops. If you need help, Mr. McBain... I know a very good... homeopathic psychotherapist. Do you mind? Just keeping her warm for you, baby. [ Sigh ] How can I win your heart? Easy. Promise not to walk away... when I'm in the middle of a sentence. [ Chuckle ] One, two, three, one, two, three... one, two, three, one, two, three. Darling, don't do it by the numbers. Do it from the heart. I'll do the best I can. Nobody can do better than that. Oh, Stewart.
