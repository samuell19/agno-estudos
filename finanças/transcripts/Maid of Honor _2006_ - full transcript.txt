- Now that was an experience. - Argentinean food. Who knew? - Who knew all the steak you can eat? - And a waiter who can Tango? Hmmph! - So how's it feel? Nineteen years. - Uh, 20 if you count the first date. - Oh yeah, the opera. You still owe me for that. - What are you talking about? - What the...? What is this guy doing? Huh? Richard! - I have a few words to say. Laci, since your sister passed away you've been a Godsend to this family. You sold your house, you moved in here with us and you've helped us through some really, really rough times, and I don't know what I would have done without you. In a nutshell we all love you. Right guys? - Yeah, a lot. - We three. - Come on Aunt Laci, make a wish and blow out the candle. - My wish already came true. - Happy birthday, Laci. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, Aunt Laci. - Oh Molly, thank you sweetheart. - Oh, you're welcome. - Thanks babe. - And this is from me. - Oh Richard it's beautiful; a jewellery box. - Well, I know how much you like butterflies. - Thank you. Thank you. This is the best birthday I've ever had, and we can watch the pirate movie together, tonight if you want. - Cool. - Well, as for me I'm out of here. - Got a date with Jason? - Ha! Ha! - Butt out Halfling. - Honey, I want you home by midnight, okay? - God, you'd think I was still in junior high. Ooh. Excuse me. - Bet it's Nicole. - Hey honey, how're you doing? - Sweetheart, will you help me clear the table? - No, no, everything's great. Well I'm glad she liked the cake. Now, you didn't spoil the surprise did you coming home early? - No, no I think she was surprised. - You think so? - Yeah, yeah. - Well, wish her a happy birthday for me, okay? - Absolutely. So, we still on for tomorrow night? - Seven o'clock on the dot? - I'll be there. - I'm looking forward to it. - Me too. I love you. - I love you too. - Okay, bye-bye. Richard. She can't have you. - Aw, come on. They said they wanted retro. - They did but they changed their minds. - We can't afford to lose these clients. - I know, and you're not to worry because I pitched them a whole new concept, sort of a hip-hop thing and they loved it. The team's already working on it. - See, now that's what I'm talking about. You know, I had a feeling that today was going to be a good day. - Hmmph. You do have an unusual spring in your step this morning. Que pasa? Oh man, oh that is fantastic. When you gonna ask her? - Tonight. - Oh, congratulations. Uh, this is gonna be good for you and good for the kids too. - Yeah, I might have a bit of a sales job there, especially with Molly. - Hmm. Well, I have faith in you. Does Laci know? - No, no not yet. - She's given up so much for you guys. - Yeah. Laci's one in a million. m4- Hey. - Well hey, how are you? These are for you, madam. - You're so sweet. They're really beautiful. Thank you. So what's the occasion? - Well, I guess now is as good a time as any so... uh... well here it goes. - Oh my God. - Will you marry me? - Richard. - Is that a yes? - Yes! Yes! Definitely a yes. I thought you needed more time. - It's been... it's been 2 years since the accident and it's been almost a year since we met. But I realize that being with you has brought the joy back into my life and I know that Carrie would want that. - And what about the kids? - Well, that might be kind of the tricky part. I love you so much Richard. Yeah. - No, Laci. I'm not hungry, take it away. You have to eat, mother. You're skin and bones. I don't like it. - Now come on, you can have one little bite. You like mashed potatoes, they don't upset your stomach. - Carrie knows how to make potatoes, you don't. - I am going to stay here until you eat your dinner. - I told you before, I don't like it. Oh, Laci, stop it! - Eat it! - Stop it! - Eat it! I'm gonna call Carrie. I need some help. No, what are you...? Oh! Laci. Laci, what happened? - Oh, I... sorry I broke one of Carrie's dishes. Stupid, stupid. - Oh, that's all right. Let me give you a hand. - I hope I can glue this back together. - Oh, I think this one's a lost cause. - Oh. - Hmmph. Uh, I... I have something that I want to tell you. Nicole and I have decided to get married. - That's wonderful. - You know how much I loved your sister and I never thought that I would find anyone like that again. - I know. - What? - Oh, it... I just wonder how the children will react. - Well, we're gonna have a long talk tomorrow. - You deserve the best, Richard. I'm happy for you. I know Carrie would be too. - Thank you, Laci. That means a lot to me. Well, good night. - Good night. I gave up everything for you. Laci, help! I can't move my legs. Help! - It's your own damn fault, mother. You shouldn't have got out of bed. - Call an ambulance. For God's sake, call an ambulance. - Why? So you can tell on me? - Baby, please. I can't breathe. My heart. My pills. - Not this time mother. Not this time. - Help me. Somebody. Carrie. - Carrie, Carrie, Carrie. Carrie isn't here. Carrie's with her husband and her children, in her beautiful house. There's nobody here but poor, pathetic Laci who gave up everything to be your nursemaid and you didn't even say thank you. - Oh God. - I'm sorry mother, I'm taking my life back. - What's going on? - Hey, it's all good. Come on in, sit down. Listen, I guess you both know that I've been seeing a lot of Nicole lately, not just at work but outside of work as well and over this past year I've come to realize what... what an amazing woman she really is. - You're not gonna marry her are you? - Well, Molly I was going to get to that but yeah. Yeah, I asked her to marry me and I'd really like your support on this, both of you, you and Danny. - So when's this gonna happen? - Well, I'm gonna be travelling a lot at the end of the summer so we thought soon. Next month. - Next month? - Well, we didn't see any reason to wait. - How about this? How about you wait till I move out?! - Oh, Molly, come on. - This woman is not going to tell me what to do, she's not my mother. - Honey, no one's trying to replace mom. I loved her more than anything else in the world. - Yeah, sure. That's why you're getting married again, right? - Molly... try to understand this, I don't think mom would want me... I don't think she's want us to be alone. - But we're not alone dad. We still have Aunt Laci. What's going to happen to her? - Well, Aunt Laci is always going to be welcome here Danny, I mean she's part of our family. - Fine, marry her but don't expect me to stick around. - Oh Molly, come on honey. Can't we talk about this like adults? - Yeah, like you really care what I think. - Molly, wait a second. - Daddy. - What? - I don't want a new mom either. - Danny? Go check on Danny, I'll see if I can catch Molly. Molly, wait up. Molly. Your dad told me about Nicole last night. - Great. I'm always the last to know. - Well, I know how you feel. We all miss your mom. I just wish I... - What? - Well, I wish I could keep the promise I made to her before she died. That I would always look after you and Danny, but I... well I was being selfish and you know, I'm sure Nicole is a lovely lady, I'm sure she can look after you two as well as I would and... she'll be a good mom. - That woman will never be my mom. - Molly. - Aunt Laci, what's the matter? - Oh, honey. Just... I'm worried about Molly. I don't know what your mother would make of all this: Your sister running away, your dad taking up wi some other woman, and you, nobody's even thinking about you, it's like nobody even cares. Any luck? - No. I went by Jason's house; his mom says she hasn't seen him all day. - Oh. - I went by the mall, I went by the Cineplex, I even went by the school. - Where is she, dad? - I don't know buddy. I don't know where else to look. - She's never do anything like this before. - Hello? - Is Richard Wynn there? - Yes, this is Richard Wynn. - This is Philly P.D. we got your daughter. - What? - We've got your daughter, sir. - Is she okay? - Yeah, we brought here in with a kid named Jason. D.U.I. She's all right. - Thank you officer. I'll be right down. She's at the police station. She got picked up in a car with Jason, D.U.I. I don't believe this. - Richard, go easy on her. She's scared and vulnerable right now. I wish... oh, it's not my place to say. - No, no, what? - I wish you would rethink the wedding, it might be too much too soon. She might not be ready. - Well, you might be right. Well... I'm gonna go get my daughter out of jail. Sergeant Lewis, line three. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Come on. Look, about Jason. - Don't worry about it, I'm done with that psycho. - Molly. - Yeah, dad? - Listen, I was thinking honey. Maybe it's better if I wait with Nicole. You're the most important thing in my life, you and Danny, and I don't want to do anything that'll hurt you. What's the matter honey? - I'd never do that to you dad. I'm the one who screwed up. - It's just... I just want you to be happy. - Count me in dad. Seriously. - Thanks, honey. - Dinner? This Friday? - Yeah, Molly and I had a long talk in the car and we thought it'd be nice to have Nicole over and spend some time with the family. - Get to know her a little better. - And we're hoping you'd cook your world famous lasagna, if you don't mind. - Not at all. - Great, thanks Lace. Uh, I'm gonna give her a call. - Okay. Hi honey. - Hello. What's this? - Strawberry cheesecake. - I thought we were gonna have peanut butter brownies. - Oh, Nicole doesn't approve. She's allergic to nuts. - Thanks. - So... what do you think about all this wedding stuff? - I don't know. - I sure am gonna miss you guys. - What do you mean? - Well... your new mommy isn't gonna want me around. - She's not my new mommy, and besides, daddy said you could stay. - Oh... honey, he was just being polite. Nicole's never had children. You can't just waltz in and become a new mommy just like that. Well, I'm sure you'll be okay. I hope so. - What's wrong Danny? You've hardly touched your lasagna. - It sure is good, your Aunt Laci's one heck of a good cook. So Molly, your dad tells me you like to write short stories. - Sort of. - What do you like to write about? - Screwed up teenagers mostly. Yeah, I know, I know, autobiographical. - When I was your age I did the same thing. I wrote every day. - You know, who knows? If you keep it up maybe you can become a successful writer like Nicole and then you can support your poor old father in his declining years. - So I hear you work from home a lot. - Yeah, one of the advantages of being freelance. - I guess that means you'll have a lot time with the children. - Absolutely. - I already told her she can set up shop in the spare bedroom. - Uh, I understand you're from Ohio? - Uh-hmm. Davenport. A small town girl. - First time to the altar? - I never met the right man until now. - Well, I'll drink to that. - Well, I'm ready for dessert, how about the rest of you? - Well, you know me. I can always pack on a few more thousand calories. How about you Danny? - I want Aunt Laci's peanut butter brownies. - Well, maybe next time, sweetheart. - Let me help you Laci. Thank you. She's cool dad. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. - I have an enormous favour to ask. My best friend Marley lives in Germany now and she's not going to be able to make it back for the wedding. - Oh. - Yeah. And as you know I don't have any family. You have done so much for Richard and the kids and it would mean the world to me, to us, if you could be a part of the ceremony. Laci, will you be my maid of honour? - Uh... that's a... very thoughtful gesture, I'd love to be. - Oh! Thank you. ought we'd have a simple wedding, you know, just a few close friends. - I understand. - Oh look, this is a nice one. - The price isn't bad either. - No, but that doesn't include the fittings. That's where they get you, believe me. - Sounds like you've done this before. - Oh, Laci look. God it's gorgeous. - Oh. - Would you like to try that on? - Oh, go ahead. Oh, it's stunning. - I love it. Now I'm not so sure about the veil. - Well, maybe not. You have good taste. - Thank you. It's beautiful the beadwork is lovely. Laci? Laci, you okay? - Oh, it's just... you look so pretty; the perfect bride. - Thank you. Oh, I need to get to Richard's office and pick up some work. - Oh, why don't I go with you and say hi. - Okay. Are you sure? - See you tomorrow man, take care. - Okay man. - Hey. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. - Oh, it's... you know me, I'm always daydreaming. - Hey, I think it is very cool that you are the maid of honour and that I am the best man. I'm thinking maybe we should be scandalous and have an affair. - As if anyone would believe it. Ha! Ha! - But we're still on for our weekly adventure in cooking, right? Veal picatta, my place at 6, I'll bring the vodka you bring the mix. Hey, that rhymes. - Looking forward to it. I'll see you. - Give it up girl. I understand you were born in Ohio. Yeah, small town girl. I never met the right man until now. - Nobody's that perfect. - Oh that sounds like you and Laci had a great time. - She's so nice. - Yeah, yeah, she is, isn't she? Hey listen, don't forget about our meeting tomorrow morning at 10. Well, we need to discuss the Beckle account. Yeah, yeah we are. We're still in the running. It's between us and Jacobs. I've got to go to New York in a couple of weeks. Has anyone seen my keys? - Dad, you're always losing stuff. - No, I could have sworn last night that I put them right on my dresser. - I'll give the house a once over, once I get back from taking Danny to school. Why don't you just take the spare set in the office? - I'm losing my mind. Right on time. "Dear Nicole, I've written you many times. Of course I never received a reply. It's been almost 12 years now and I can tell you honestly..." ...that my life here in this place has been a living hell. They let me call Mrs. Kelsey and she told me you moved away from Lakewood a long time ago, but she wouldn't tell me where to. I don't blame her after all that I did. I miss you and still love you. I wish you would come to see me so we could talk. "Love always, Joel." "Dear Nicole, he asked me to forward this on, best regards, Savannah." Operator, the name is Kelsey, first name Savannah. Just a moment please. I have an S. Kelsey on Langley. - Yeah, yeah, that's it. Could you give me the exact address? - 175... Did you say 175 with a...? Darn battery. Uh, excuse me. - Yes. Can I help you? - Well, I hope so. I'm... I'm looking for an old friend of mine from Ohio, Nicole Garvey. I heard she moved here a few years ago. - There was a Nicole, lived right across the street only she wasn't a Garvey, she was a Maiser, married to Joel Maiser. - Married? - Well, then they got divorced. You didn't know? - Uh, no. Uh, we hadn't seen each other since we were really young. - So you didn't know about the trouble. - Trouble? - Such a sad story. It was in all the papers. Listen, if... if you're a friend of hers it would be better if she told you herself. If you leave your name I can drop her a line. - Oh no, I'm just passing through, thought I'd take a chance. It's no big deal. Uh, thanks again. "Joel Maiser, sentenced to 20 years for manslaughter, distribution of controlled substances. Maiser's wife Nicole was also arrested held for possession of narcotics but was later cleared of all the charges." Hmmph... I got ya. ...and the topic was...? - Kevin, listen it has been a crazy day, I haven't got anything done. Uh, do you mind if we get together next week instead? - No, no can do. I've got to take a quick trip to L.A. - Oh, I guess it'll have to wait until after the wedding. - Hmm. A clandestine rendez-vous while the two lovebirds are on their honeymoon? - Uh-huh, sounds good. - Okay, it's a done deal. - See ya. - Area 732? Where the hell's that? - Hi sweetheart. - Hi. - Here you go. - Thank you. What took you so long Aunt Laci? - Oh I'm sorry sweetheart. The traffic was a nightmare. - I don't like it when you're late. - Oh, I'm sure Nicole will be on time to pick you up every day. - I don't want Nicole to pick me up. I want you. - Well I don't have anything to say about it sweetheart, and if you must know I was out looking for a place to live today. I'm... I'm gonna have to leave soon. Poor you. First your mom and now... I just wish there was something I could do for you. - My stomach hurts. - I'll tell you what. We'll go home, get some nice hot milk, okay? - Okay. - Uh-uh. What's 7x6? - 42. - Uh-hmm. - Hmm. - What's wrong, Danny? - I don't want Aunt Laci to leave. - Oh, listen to me. I haven't even spoken to Aunt Laci about this so I don't really know what she wants to do. - She's going away, just like mommy. - Listen, come on. She's not going away. Even if she doesn't live with us, she'll still come visit all the time. She loves you, and I love you, and you know what, Nicole loves you too. - "Forgive me, I prefer to remain anonymous but I have some news that might be of great interest to you. Nicole is getting married to a man in Philadelphia named Richard Wynn. She has asked me to convey her desire to speak with you to try to patch things up before the wedding. Therefore I am enclosing her number in the hopes that you will contact her and settle your differences as soon as possible. I wish you the best of luck." - Perfect, the top client's in from New York and I'm running late. Good first impression, huh? - Where's Nicole? - Uh, she's meeting me at the restaurant. I got it. Hello? - Will you accept a collect call from Eagle Ridge Penitentiary? - Where? - Eagle Ridge Penitentiary in New Jersey. - Uh, yeah, okay. - Just a moment please. - Dad, we're getting a call from a penitentiary in New Jersey? - What? - Hello, Nicole? - Excuse me, who is this? - Joel Maiser. - And where are you calling from? - Is Nicole around? - No, no she's not. Now what's this all about? - I got a letter saying that I could reach her at this number. - Well, I'm afraid there's been some kind of mistake. - Are you Richard Wynn? - Yeah, yeah, you dialled my phone number. - Then there hasn't been a mistake. You're the one who's marrying my wife. Well, my ex-wife I guess. - What? I'm sorry, your ex-wife? Come on, what is this, some kind of joke? Nicole has never been married. - Think again. She was married to me for six years. I bought her a nice place out in Lakewood, New Jersey. Didn't she tell you? - No, no she didn't. - Then I guess you two need to get better acquainted. Tell her Joel called. She knows where to reach me. - Richard, who was calling? - Nicole has an ex-husband? - Calling from jail? - I thought she'd never been married before. - Yeah, Molly, so did I. - My God, what's going on here? - Hi. I was getting a little worried. I hear Clemens and Simon are clamouring for your advertising genius. - Yeah. - What's the matter? - I... I need to talk to you. I uh... I received a disturbing phone call tonight. - About what? - Do you know Joel Maiser? Were you married to this guy? Nicole, how could you not tell me about this? - I'm so sorry Richard. I was going to tell you but... - What? - It's complicated. - Well it's complicated, so what? You just thought you'd lie to me about it and maybe I'd never find out? - I can't do this now. - So what should we do? Should we go in there the happy couple, shake everybody's hand, accept their good wishes for our happy life together? Well you know what Nic, I'm not sure I can do that right now either. - No Richard, you're right. Nicole. - Hey. - Hey. - You need anything? - Uh-uh. Some night, huh? - Did she admit that man was her husband? Richard... whatever you decide promise me you'll think about the children. They're so confused. They've had enough trauma in their lives. You know, bringing Nicole into this house under such a cloud. I just don't know. - I understand and I agree. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing? - Uh, admiring these and uh... straightening up your dad's room. You're gonna be late for school Molly. - Yeah. You tried calling her? - I've been calling all morning, she's not picking up. - So you're thinking what, cancel the wedding? - You know, right now, Kevin, I'm thinking I don't have much choice. - No, no, now you listen to me old buddy. You do have a choice. You get your ass over there and you talk to her face to face. Richard, Nicole is one of the most terrific women that I have ever met and I am sure that she has a very good explanation for all this. You have to give her the chance to explain herself. Now you owe her that. - Yeah, you're right. Thanks. - They don't call me the best man for nothing. - Listen, have a safe flight to L.A., call me when you get there, all right? - Okay. Will do. Oh, where did that guy say he lived with Nicole when they were together? - Uh, Lakewood. Lakewood, New Jersey, why? - Uh, no reason. Bye. - See ya. - I was very young when I married Joel. He was older, he owned the restaurant where I worked as a waitress. What I didn't know then is that he had another business, a drug business. - Oh God. - After we were married, the drugs starting taking over. He became violent. I tried to leave him, but... I was so young and I was so scared of him. Things started getting worse and... he was sentenced to 20 years for manslaughter for killing some guy, and when the police searched our house, they found the drugs, and so I was held for suspicion of trafficking. I was booked, interrogated, the works. It was awful. I never had anything to do with the drugs, Richard. I was cleared and in the process I lost everything. I left Lakewood and I started over. Here I am. - Well why couldn't you tell me this, Nicole? I thought we could talk about anything, I thought we trusted each other. - I spent nine years trying to forget that man. Nine years trying to forget myself. I was so afraid to tell you. I was so afraid you wouldn't understand. - Aw, baby... Shh-shh-shh. Shh-shh-shh. Look at me, look at me. I'm not that guy. You don't ever have to be afraid with me. - I am so sorry. - No, no, you've got nothing to apologize for. I love you so much, Nicole. - I love you. - Hello? - Yeah, hi. Uh, what number is this? - This is the phone outside the library. - What library? - Lakewood. - Lakewood, New Jersey? - That's right. - Okay. Thank you. - That looks nice. - Hey everybody. Hey Danny, can you come in here for a sec? Come on in bud, this is a family conversation, you should be a part of it. - What happened, dad? What did she say? - Well, Nicole and I had a long talk and uh... listen, she's faced obstacles in her life that I can't even begin to imagine and she's come through them with unbelievable courage. And I respect her, and I love her more than ever. She's a good person, she really is and she cares about this family and I know that this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I hate her. She doesn't deserve him. - She... doesn't... - Aunt Laci? - Hang on, sweetheart. Hang on, darling, I'll be right there. - Is everything okay? - Come in honey. Oh!... Oh, Danny, my sweet, sweet Danny. - Why'd you leave dinner? What's the matter? - Nothing, honey. Nothing. Oh, my Danny. I keep thinking about Nicole. - Hum, hum... She didn't tell any of us about that bad man in jail. What's gonna happen when they let him out? What if he comes here? What if he tries to hurt you? I'll be gone, I won't be able to help you. Oh Danny, I just don't know what's gonna happen to you. - I don't want her to come here. I don't like Nicole. - Shh. Shh. There's nothing we can do. There's nothing we can do. Your daddy cares more about Nicole than he does about us. I shouldn't have said that. Look at me. Swear to me that you won't tell anyone your Aunt Laci said such a thing. It'll be our little secret. You swear to me? - I swear, Aunt Laci. Good boy. Good boy. What's the matter? - I don't feel good. Stomach hurts again. - Oh. You're hot. You have a temperature. - Well, it looks like Danny's just fine. It's definitely not his appendix and the tests don't show anything abnormal. - Oh, good. Hmm. So, what is it? - It's probably just a nervous stomach. He does seem a little anxious. We can give him something to help him relax. - Okay, good. - Okay. I'll have that ready for you in a few minutes. - Well thank you, doctor. - You're welcome. - See, you're gonna be okay. - Sweetie, why don't you slip into your shirt? - I'll be right back. - Richard, that child came to me in tears and shaking all over. When I asked him what was wrong, he made me swear not to tell you. - Not to tell me what? - Well, it's Nicole. - What? - He has worked himself into a fit over her. I've never seen a child so distraught in all my life. I am worried about his health. Look, I just... I beg you to think long and hard about what's at stake here. - Laci, hi. - Ha... What a nice surprise. I wasn't expecting you. - I heard about Danny, I wanted to come over. - Oh, yeah, he's not feeling very well. I don't think he's up for visitors. - It's okay. Hi, baby. - Hey. - Come on in. I, uh... I talked to Nicole this morning and I told her what you said last night. - Ah... - I realize it's a real delicate situation. I just... I wanted a chance to make it right, let him get to know me a little better. - Yeah. - Uh, I don't think so. I mean, I just don't think so. - Lace, uh... I really agree with Nicole on this. - Hey pal. - Hey. - There's someone here to see you. Nicole heard that you were feeling a little bit under the weather. - I just wanted to say hello. - Listen, I've got a phone call I've gotta make. I'll be right back. - Stomach still upset? I'm sorry. I brought you something. Blackbeard's Gold. I read it when I was a kid and I loved it, and I was thinking since you like pirates, you might like it too. - Thanks. - Danny, I think I might know what you're going through right now, a lot of changes. I went through a lot of scary changes when I was your age. My mom died when I was just a little bit older than you are now. - What happened? - She had cancer. I still miss her every day. - How's my little patient doing? Ha! Ha! This ought to make you feel better; peanut butter brownies, your favourite, and some milk. - Mmm. - How's everything going? - We were just having a nice little chat. - Oh, that's wonderful. Hmm! Hmm! Oof, pirates. You know I think they give me nightmares, all those stories about bad men running around killing people. - Laci, do you think you give Danny and me just another minute or so? - Sure. Sorry to interrupt. - Danny, what's wrong? - That man is going to come here. - What man? - That man from the jail, that man you married. - Oh honey, no. No, he's gonna be in jail for a very long time, until you're all grown up. Is that what you were worried about? I'm sorry. I don't want to try to replace your mom or your Aunt Laci. I just want to try to be your friend. Will that be okay? And before you answer, full disclosure. I like pirates, baseball, dirt bikes and when I was growing up I had a pet snake. - A real snake with fangs? - No, it was a garden snake, but it liked to wrap itself around my arms and legs. I called him Snarkey. Danny, I would like for us to be together, like a family. Do you think you could maybe give me a trial run? - Okay. - He's a really good kid. - Yeah, he is a good boy. Thanks for coming. I love you. - Thank you, Laci, for letting me talk to him. - Not a problem. Oh, listen, did you remember to order your cake for the bridal shower? - Called the bakery yesterday. I couldn't resist, I had him change it to chocolate. - Ah, sounds scrumptious, and no nuts? - Absolutely not. This house is officially a nut-free zone. - You know, I'm gonna be on that side of town on Friday. Why don't I just pick it up? - Oh, that'd be great Lace, thank you. You're a doll. - You ready? - Uh-huh. - Bye. Drive safely, okay? - Yeah. - "Allergic to nuts, anaphylactic shock, fatal in some cases." It sounds terrible. As soon as I finish the prayer, I'll begin the vows, first with you, Richard, and then with you, Nicole. Everybody know their lines? - I do. - Then of course you'll give her the ring. - Okay, then I put it on and then I give you a little kiss. - You might want to wait until after I pronounce you man and wife. - Sorry, just practicing. - Stop kissing him! Aaaah! - You know what? I don't know about everybody else, but I'm ready for this rehearsal dinner. - Sure you don't want me to take the kids? I don't mind. - No, no, they're already in the car with Nicole, it's no problem. - I'll get home as soon as I can. I have to stop by the store and get some stuff. We don't have anything in the house for breakfast tomorrow. - Well, don't stay out too late. See you, huh. - Laci. - Hi. - Hi. Well, you were certainly very quiet tonight. You didn't feel like giving a toast to the bride and groom. - I'm not very good at that sort of thing. - I think we should take a walk. We need to talk. How long have we known each other now Laci? What is it, five, six years? - It's about that. Why? - I think I know who sent that letter to Nicole's ex-husband. It was you. - Oh, come on, Kevin, stop joking. - You made the mistake of calling me from a public phone at the Lakewood city library. I kept a copy of the number on my cell. u went there to see if you could dig up some dirt on Nicole, and you sure hit the mother lode, didn't you? - Ah... This is crazy. - I know why you did it, Laci. You're in love with Richard, and you thought that if you could embarrass Nicole, maybe he wouldn't go through with marriage. - Kevin... - No, Laci, I've had my eye on you for a long time now and you can't fool your old buddy Kev. I know what it's like to love someone and not have that love returned, but that is no excuse to do what you did. Now I think it would be best for everyone if you went away. I won't say anything about this so long as you are out of that house by the end of the week. - I can't do that. - Laci, don't force me to be the bad guy. - Are you threatening me? - I cannot allow you to go on hurting my best friend and an innocent woman. - I thought you cared about me. - I do, I do care about you very much and that is why I'm doing this for your own good. Oof! We'll be there in a minute. Molly. Thanks honey. - Kevin was so excited about the wedding. - Yeah, he said that nobody had ever asked him to be best man before. Well I know this. He wouldn't want us to change our plans. - He said he was just going for a walk to get some air. I keep thinking if I'd gone with him, none of this would have happened. - I just hope they catch the son of a bitch who did this. - Thanks. You know, Laci, I just... I don't think it's right to have a bridal shower under these circumstances. - Really? Well... Well the girls have planned on it, the cake is ordered. - I'm just not in the mood to celebrate. - Well, I know how you feel. But... you know, Richard's gonna be out of town for a few days and we'll both be alone. It might do us good to be out and be with friends. Besides, I'm pretty sure Kevin would want us to toast the bride and groom with an overpriced bottle of Château d'Yquem. What do you say? - You're right. For Kevin. - For Kevin. Not a bad match. Mmm! It doesn't taste as good without the nuts anyway. - Come in. Hey brat, I thought you were spending the night at Jeff's. - His mom will be here in a minute. - What's with the weirdo look? - If you had a secret, but you knew it was a bad secret, would you tell anybody? - Uh, I might. It depends, who is it about? - Uh, Aunt Laci. - What about Aunt Laci? - She said a lot of really bad things about Nicole. She said that daddy cares more about her than he does about us. She made me swear not to tell. - None of that's true, Dan-o. - I know. - And you did the right thing by telling me. - So, tell me about your dress. - Oh, it's so beautiful. It's got this beadwork, it... No, I'm not gonna say a word 'cause you're gonna tell your dad. It's bad luck for the groom to know what the bride's gonna look like on that day. - So how many people are coming to the wedding? - 30 maybe 35, we didn't send out that many initiations. We want to keep it just friends and family. - Excuse me. - You picked a really nice church Nicole. - Isn't it a gorgeous church? I fell in love with it the second I saw it. You know Richard actually... - Oh, how lovely. Thanks for picking up the cake, Laci. That looks decadent. - Oh it does, but don't be fooled. I bet you there's chocolate inside. - Plenty of it. No excuses, ladies. - Can I help? - Oh no, no, absolutely not. You are the blushing bride, you are the star for the day. You get the biggest piece and the first bite. - That piece is way too big. - Ha! Ha! Here you go. - Oh, just go for it. Okay. Mmm. That is so good. - Well, I think we're all gonna be working this off for the next six months. - At least. - Oh, you know what? I want to make a toast. To a good friend. To Kevin who I'm sure is with us today in spirit. - To Kevin. - To Kevin. - And to Laci... who's the nicest maid of honour a girl could ever hope for. - Ha! Ha! - Here, here. - To Laci. - Here, here. - Molly, here's a piece for you. - Nicole? What's the matter Nicole? - My throat. - Are you okay? - I need my medicine. My medicine, where is it? - Here, let me see. I don't see it. - I'm gonna call 911. What can I do? - I'll go with her to the hospital. Call your dad, tell him to get here as soon as he can. - Okay, I'll meet you there. Let me have your keys. - Oh, keys. Hurry. - All right, Nicole. I need you to hang in there, okay? I'm gonna give you some medication to help you breathe. Here we go. - What's happening? - She's going into cardiac arrest. Now Nicole... Hang in there, I'm not gonna lose you. Charging. All clear. Breathe. I think we're out of the woods. ing.- Don't worry, Gwen. I'll call you as soon as I hear anything. - You want me to come? - No, that won't be necessary. - Oh, hang in there. - Thanks. Bye-bye. - Bye. - She's doing much better. It looks like everything's gonna be okay. I've given her a strong sedative to make her sleep and we're going to be moving her to a private room shortly. - And you think all of this happened because there might have been nuts in the food? - Even a trace amount could lead to anaphylactic shock, but she's over the worst of it. We'll keep an eye on her for tonight and probably send her home in a couple of days. - Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome. - I hope dad got that early flight. - Yeah. You know, I'm probably gonna want to stay the night here. Would you mind going by the house, getting a change of clothes, toothbrush, that kind of thing? - Sure. Dr. Parker, telephone line 5. Dr. Parker. She said a lot of really bad things about Nicole. She said that daddy cares more about her than he does about us. She made me swear not to tell. What are you doing? Danny, I would like for us to be together, like a family. Do you think you could maybe give me a trial run? - Okay. - Good. Thanks for picking up the cake, Laci. - What's the matter Nicole? My throat... I need my medicine. She said a lot of really bad things about Nicole. - She made me swear not to tell. - My dear, twice I told you... - They're just about to move her. - Thank you. - Hi, this is Richard Wynn, please leave a message. - Dad, we need to talk. I think there's something really freaky going on with Aunt Laci. - Is there any way you can go faster? - Thank you. Sorry it had to come to this. But I deserve some happiness too. - Excuse me. Have they moved Nicole Garvey yet? - I'll check. - Come on. Away. Laci? What are you doing? - Nothing, just making her a little more comfortable. Here we go. - Why is she breathing like that? - Oh, she's probably just... having a bad dream. - Shouldn't we get the nurse or something? - No, no, she just left. It's no problem. - I don't believe you. - What? - You were trying to hurt her. - How could you say such a thing? - I've been watching you the past few days, you hate her, don't you? - I am not going to stand here and be lectured by a foolish child. - What's going on here? - Dad, I came in and she was standing over Nicole and it looked like she was... - Molly, you have been acting out all day and I am sick and tired of it. - You were trying to smother Nicole. I saw it with my own eyes. - You have gone way out of line, young lady. - All right, both of you just calm down. - Dad, Nicole got sick at the restaurant. She couldn't find her medication. She was sure that she had it in her purse. - Ah. - You were sitting right next to her, you took it. - All right, Molly. - That is ridiculous. - Molly, Molly, Molly, not another word. - Thank you Richard. It's been a very, very stressful day. You see, the kind of thing that I have been dealing with. - What did the doctor say? - She's gonna be okay. She's lucky to be alive. - The doctor said she had an allergic reaction to nuts. She got sick right after she ate the cake. Aunty Laci is the one who brought the cake. - This is crazy. I am not gonna stand here and listen to this. - You want to talk about crazy? Why did you tell Danny all those lies about Nicole? Why did you tell him that dad cares more about her than he does about us? - I... - Laci? - I... I have no idea what she is talking about. - Danny told me the whole story. She was trying to make him hate Nicole, just like she does. - You are an ungrateful, spoiled little bitch! - Hey, hey, hey. - Dad, she's got some kind of sicko thing for you. - Richard... - I caught her the other day in your room. She was trying on the ring. She was rubbing it against her cheek. I mean, it all makes sense now. She wants to be your girlfriend or something. - Laci? Just stay here. Laci! Laci, stop! All right, I just want to talk. - It's our family, not hers! I won't let her take it away! - What? - For two years, I have taken care of you and the children, I have cleaned your house, I have cooked your meals. For two years, I have given you my life and every day, you looked at me and you never saw me! - Laci, I... I appreciate you more than anybody else in the world, I do. - I don't want to be appreciated, Richard! I want to be loved! Please, don't let her come between us! - Laci. There is no us. I love Nicole. Laci. - Hey, what are you doing? - I won't live without you, Richard. - Laci, wait, Laci! She was so distraught. I'm very worried about her. - Dad, Nicole's awake. - Excuse me. - Hey, Richard. - How are you, are you okay? - Uh-huh. - You had us worried there for a second. - Sorry. - It's all right, don't do that again though. Hey, Danny, where's my best man, huh? Hey bud, time to go. - Will they ever find her? - I don't know, Danny. The ocean's a big place. - Is she up in heaven with mommy? - Yeah. Yeah, I think she is. Come on. Do you promise to love him, comfort him, honour and keep him in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live? - I do. - Do you have the rings? - Yes. - You may now place the ring on her finger... Now his on him. By the power invested in me I now pronounce you man and wife. Now you may kiss the bride. - I still don't know why you don't do something more exotic than going to Mr. Jackson's summerhouse. - Well, it shows what you know because it's gorgeous up there and there's beautiful mountains, and you know what? It's just stage one anyway. - Oh yeah, in August we're gonna go to Paris and we're gonna go to Spain. - Oh. - Hey, you got the number at the house, right? You got my cell number. If you need me, you call me. - Dad, it's okay, I got it under control. - Oh, I look after a lot of these big houses out on the lake. I've been looking after Mr. Jackson's place since he built it. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. He comes up here about once a month. He likes the solitude. Anyway, you two need anything I'm close by, just up the road. - Thank you, Terry. - Call this number and I'll come a running. - All righty. - Ooh. I love it. - Well that's good because I love you. - Oh, so romantic. - Uh-hmm. Can I interest you in a little champagne? - Now how did you manage to get that up here without me seeing it? - Well, it's a mystery, but it involves a suitcase. Mmm, timing. - Probably Molly just checking to make sure we made it up safe and sound. - Yeah. Hello? Hi, Richard. Do you know where your children are? Laci? - You know how much I love Molly, Danny. I'm standing outside, looking at them right now. They're mine, Richard. I'm not gonna let that woman take th. - Laci. Laci, listen to me. Laci! Laci! She's alive and she just threatened the kids. Oh my God, Richard. - Hello? - Molly, it's dad. Are you okay? - Hi dad. Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay good. Where's Danny. - Uh, he's in his room playing. Dad, why are you calling me on... - Molly, listen to me. I want you to get Danny and lock all the doors in the house. - Dad, you're scaring me. What is it? - It's Laci, she's alive, honey, and Molly, she may be near the house. - Oh, my God. - She just called here. Now get your brother and lock the doors. - Daddy... - Do it. - Daddy! - Molly? Molly? - Gotcha! - Don't you ever do that again, you little creep! - Molly, are you okay? Molly! - Yeah, dad, it was just Danny. - All right honey. I'm gonna call the police. You two sit tight, I'll be there as soon as I can. - Okay. - All right. I'm gonna go get changed. 911, what is your emergency? - Yeah, my name is Richard Wynn, the emergency's in Philadelphia. Someone is threatening to kill my kids. - What's the matter, Molly? - What the...? Come on. Come on. - I'm scared. - Richard? Richard, I'm ready to go. Richard. Richard? Honey. Richard. Oh! Who's there? - Of course it's me, Nicole, back from the grave, back to finish what I started. Richard was mine, you took him from me, turned him against me. - Where is he, Laci? - Never mind. You'll never see him again. - Oh! - Oh... Oh... I took care of him. I took care of him. - Richard! Oh, my God! - Nic... - Richard! It's okay. It's okay. - Richard. - Are you all right? - Oh, Richard. - Oh, my God. - So, are you excited? - Very excited. - Ha! Ha! - That a boy, you should be. - Yeah, I'm excited. - You guys are absolutely sure about this? - You betcha, Molly. - Oh, what fun is a honeymoon if you don't bring your kids with you, right Danny? - Right. - Good boy, let's go. You in? - Yeah. - Can you grab that? - Yeah sure. - Thank you. Go.
