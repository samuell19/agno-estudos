Long live Workers' Unity! Long live Comrade Sridharan! The proprietor is threatening a lock-out! Victory to the workers' strike We demand justice Workers' strike: 65th day Comrade Sridharan undertakes fast Fight unto victory Fight unto death Long live workers' unity Long live ... long live Long live Comrade Sridharan! ﻿Homage to Comrade Sridharan's memory ﻿Who is this Sidharan? There is no one like him that I can think of He used to smoke bundles of "beedis" every day As for food, he survived on tea alone And he liked my tea in particular Why talk of all that? We are all responsible for what happened to him Are you asleep? - Who is it? A stranger Stranger? I am new here and it is late at night now Please come in. I am sorry to trouble you. I need a place to sleep for tonight Here ... I will manage Will you have some tea? I never say no to tea No need to pay. Business hours are over Had this shop for long? 15 years now Yet ... You must be wondering why I haven't done better? Only thugs and cheats prosper these days He meant everything to us He made me what I am ﻿What's your name? - Sudhakaran. ﻿Do you know who that is? That is Lenin ... the great liberator of the proletariat No school today? I stopped school 2 years ago You have already started earning for your family! I have many doubts ... Good It is from doubts that the mind's search begins This system must change. It is the only solution Comrades! Please assemble for the meeting The meeting is now open To begin with ... Comrade Sridharan will be feted by respective trade unions Comrades and friends! We have assembled here today to make our just demands for permanent jobs and due wages ﻿We, the exploited, are raising our voice against a Capitalist management Comrades! Now is the time for us to stand united ﻿and fight for our rights! Police Sir, did they beat you at the police station? Many attempts have been made to form a Trade Union All have failed The Proprietor bribes them or else the police gets them Ater all, the rich control the people in power and the police Stop police brutality ﻿Shun management stooges Protest meeting Sridharan was a very shy person He wouldn't look at women ﻿Unusual in a trade unionist Is Damodaran in? No My brother has gone to the market He won't be long ﻿Won't you come in? ﻿No, I must go ﻿Because my brother is not in? ??? Ask him to see me please Men alone don't form unions ﻿Aren't you there to organise our women? ﻿Personal relationships, pleasures, gain, ﻿must be sacrificed by a Communist Individual achievement is not our goal It would only obstruct social progress on the whole Individuals are like leaves on the Tree of Society Class struggle is the basic decisive force in history ﻿The crux of modern social revolution lies in the ﻿struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat Throughout the history of the Communist Movement one sees the conflict between Marxism-Leninism and opportunistic and divisive forces. Marx, Engels and Lenin have studied in depth the essential problems of the working class and have taught us how to counter all these divisive forces. Opportunists and revisionists are essentially agents of the bourgeoisie. Instead of organising the working class to fight the bourgeoisie they keep urging the working class to cooperate with them. ﻿May I ask you something? ﻿Yes? Let me put it to you straight: Why do you hate women? I don't understand you. You will never understand! I am here to invite you formally to my wedding It won't be a big ceremony, but you must definitely come ﻿Don't assume that my marriage will stop me from Trade Union work ﻿I am not a political person. In fact, I had not met the man Who are you? What's wrong? Water! Hurry! Bring some water Aren't you connected with the trade union? Why did they try to kill you? I don't know. ﻿How can we leave him here in this condition? Hold him. High time we stopped it They think they can wipe out the movement with terror! We are lucky we got you back alive No more indecision. We must stop the factory from functioning To do so we workers must be united But we have turncoats among us We must use strategy Even our enemies must be brought into our fold They will have to join us. It is merely a matter of time. The Union must raise enough funds. Or who will feed their families? When will you be back? ﻿This evening, if possible Not for a few days He must recover No need to hurry We will consult you here What was that noise, daughter? Nothing You are not eating? I have no appetite Who is it? I want to apologise I should not have behaved so with you In a weak moment ... I lost control of myself It's all right Is your father in? Yes. - Call him. Is one Sridharan staying here? - Yes For how long? About two months How is he connected with you? He is my daughter's husband I see ﻿Is it that long since the truck-driver died? Where is your new son-in-law from? ﻿His home town? Near Kottayam Your son-in-law has a police record ﻿A number of offences are noted against him ﻿Ask him to report at the police station by this evening ﻿Not offering any tea? The calf drank the remaining milk I must go now I warn you, it is better he reports by this evening You really mean what you said about Sridharan? Yes, my dear. I leave the rest to your fate Do you know where he is from? If you don't, how could I? I can't bear it What is it? Are you unwell? Stomachache. It's terrible. Why didn't you call me? I didn't want to wake you It is terrible Should I call father? No You'll find a bottle in the corner of my box Get it please What medicine is this? Is it brandy? - Yes How do you feel now? - Better No one should know of this Not even your father Our child Go to sleep Have you had this stomachache before? Is this the first time? He is a lowdown cheat Or else a complete idiot Look at the opportunities he had. He made use of none! ??? Where to, all alone? ﻿Who said I was alone? At this rate you will be Offering me company? Pity you don't know a well-wisher Rumour has it that some strikers will report for work ﻿Who said so? -Everyone is talking of it They say you are to blame for workers being so stubborn and their families dying of starvation! Is that what they say? Where is the need for all this? What? Creating all this hatred and violence! Believe me, the Proprietor is a good man True, he is a little stubborn But we all are In this case, he is justified. He has invested his own money! You must understand He likes smart energetic people He has a special liking for you Why? That is what I want to tell you For some time he has been waiting to meet you alone But I seldom find you alone Why should he and I be alone? You expect him to hold secret talks in the open? So I must meet him in secret in the dark of the night and enjoy the Scotch whisky that the Proprietor will pour for me? And leave this town accepting his white-collar job? Or accept his cash and beat a treachrous retreat? This is why he wants to meet me? Do as you please The wise man knows an opportunity If not, he is a fool. A plain fool October Revolution Why the hell are you here? You want to revolt? I will finish you lot! Industrialist killed Gory end for a social worker industrialist Unknown assailants kill industrialist ﻿Attempt to give political colour to murder Murder connected with smuggling Family squabble behind murder Labour strike culminates in murder Sridharan and comrades go underground Mummy, you always lie to me It is no lie If he is alive, your father will surely come back ﻿I don't believe you. You always say the same thing Daddy must be dead ﻿Why is the Party Building named after him? That is because the Party loves and respects him I want to see him just once Hail, Lord Krishna Talking of Sridharan? Don't give the boy false hopes ﻿It's years since his comrades returned from jail and hiding His own Party came into power Had he returned then, what a reception he would have had! And you think he will return now? It's late. Serve his dinner Will you dine as well? As soon as I finish reciting from the Holy Book The poet asks: O Divine parrot, tell me the rest of the story The answer: it is difficult to narrate what follows Yet I shall try to tell you the gist It could be for the better Savitri! Who is it? It is I You! Our son! Shall I wake him? No Father would not believe it ﻿Even today he said you would not return Shall I wake him? No My dearest, where were you all these years? All we needed to know was that you were alive I want to sleep At least a letter Daddy not up yet? I will go and see Don't disturb him. Let him sleep He is still sleeping My daddy sleeps too much! Still loitering? Get ready for school Morning Mother! Today I won't go to school That can't be There is so much I want to ask Daddy But he is still sleeping Nobody will take him away Ask all you want when you return from school You are too strict Is it true? Yes Where is he? Sleeping What a time to sleep! Go and wake him up He is worn out. Let him wake on his own Where is he sleeping? Inside? Let him sleep. I will return later Grandpa, promise me this: Daddy will not leave this house till I return Daughter, now wake him People have come to see him Please get up Will you wake up? People are here to see you Drink some tea Where were you all these years? I will take this. It won't be returned Nor will I ask for it I am Sudhakaran No one thought he would return He looks sleepy His fatigue is obvious Let him sleep. We will go Sorry I could not come to see you till now You won't blame me when you know how busy I've been ﻿Collecting Church funds, renewing bus licences, Income Tax problems There is a tax on everything these days It is all too much I am not all that active in Trade Union work these days Where have I the time? I do what I can to help the Party with funds When the Party split the problen was which side to join Then I decided on the Right Wing Fill it Comrade, this is not like the local stuff. It's potent ﻿The Factory has changed hands. The son has taken over He is a decent guy. Have you met him? No You must. We will meet him together. He is unlike his father After all, education shows Finished it? You can't fill yourself with drink! My wife has cooked dinner. Leave space for food Fill it ??? Fetch the bottle which is on the lowest shelf When did you start drinking? A lot has happened in your absence Now you will hear stories You must know the truth My money is hard-earned Dinner is ready Let us move to the table I will go Without eating? It can't be! Rice has been served I don't want it You can go in my car. - No Aren't you going to school? ﻿Have you been waiting long? Why don't you sit down? It's all rotten - stinking! ﻿There is no link between what they say and do I can't accept it It is against my convictions Who can I talk to of all this? Sir, only you will understand Because you taught me Why are you silent? I heard that you had returned I have been wanting to see you You have grown old too soon I have two children now ﻿Sridharan, my son, wait for me No one thought you would come back Did you meet my brother? You know it, comrade The split in the Party was due to Marxism-Leninism being let down by opportunist and revisionist forces Unity is no doubt a great ideal and a worthy slogan But how can Marxists join hands with reactionaries? I don't want to hide anything At the '64 Calcutta Conference, when the Party split was complete you should have come out and made known your stand Remember Lenin's words? Those who take a stand against the basic interest and revolutionary spirit of the working class will no doubt be treated as reactionaries. By weakening the proletariat they help the bourgeoisie interest I hope you understand Should I clarify further? No Don't misunderstand me Comrade Sridharan Memorial Building The Communist Party of India will hold a meeting this evening to explain the political situation You are leaving, comrade? Sudhakaran, I have something to tell you Sorry, comrade, I'm in a hurry You want the medicine? Don't drink it all Everyone knows you are in need I had a talk with our Union comrades Everyone is eager to help you But we need your cooperation There is a vacancy in the factory for a cashier The old cashier was suspended He has no chance now. The evidence is against him The snag could be the claim by two clerks that it is a promotional job When you are the candidate, the Union will manage the rest Why do you laugh? The Proprietor too is interested Why make a permanent enemy of factory owners? The man is an amenable type But you must make the first move Don't rush to a decision. Take your time Sudharakan is here. I'll go now There are hundreds of problems to attend to ??? Do you know that they have expelled me? The charges are many Indiscipline. Anti-Party activity. Bad conduct too They are acting in collusion Let them not think they can defeat us! We will resist, to the last Today I am not alone There are armies of determined young people ... getting ready to face anything that comes their way The working class will single out opportunists and traitors We will tear the mask off the enemies of the people Don't beat me, Mummy. I did not take the money Who else could steal it? Tell the truth! Why beat him, daughter? I can pardon anything but stealing Ask him why he stole it Did you take the money, dear? No, Grandpa, I haven't even seen it Mummy would not listen to me. She beat me again and again Why is he crying? No news after you left It was difficult to trace your address I have been waiting to meet you Then I saw you walking in I must talk to you What are you up to? The air stinks with accusations and counter accusations, of rivals who call themselves communists And now you have become and object of disgust What is your game? Comrade, why did you let us down? What have I done? - You want to know? You want us to tell that too? Sir, you have disappointed everyone You gave us hopes and dreams. And you yourself shattered them. Where to, Comrade? Sit down. Have your tea first. And take your time to answer. I don't want tea. You only drink liquor? Whose letter is it? - It's nothing. Let me see? There is no need. The proletarian movement passes through various stages of growth At every stage, a set of people stagger and stop and drop out of the movement's march forward Wasn't it Lenin who said that? I understand your feelings well Comrade, understand this: Expelling Sudhakaran was not a hasty decision In present circumstances, the stand you take is decisive for the Party If you decide to keep silent it will be interpreted as virtual support to the revisionists This document reaffirms the faith the party has in you. Only such a statement can remove the confusion among Party ranks No need to rush. Keep it signed and ready by tomorrow morning. We have dealt with dead elephants so far What of live ones? We cannot deny the importance of the mighty elephants, useful for pulling logs and leading processions. Is he in? - No. Where is he? Mummy! It is you? Where has he gone? Don't you know he is never home in the evenings? Anything urgent? I can't say it is not urgent Did he sign that statement? What statement? I did not see any What is it? It's nothing ﻿He came for Sridharan? ﻿Why didn't you ask him to search the liquor dens? Is the comrade in? He is not back yet So he'll be late Just tell him I came to see him Daughter! Sridharan has been killed! He was in the liquor den till late last night Can't understand it! What use is it to anyone to kill him? Long live the revolution! Long live comrade Sridharan! Long live Workers' Union! Long live ... long live ... long live Unity ﻿Long live, long live, long live Comrade Sridharan!
