Monitors on. Program Bertolucci. Assignment on. Satellite link on. Shh. Spyder, that way. Let's do it. Live feed... On. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Mr. Bertolucci is not to be underestimated. He's known as "The Cat." Why's that? He survived eight assassination attempts. This is why our client has come to us. Display camera A. Jimmy. What's your status? All clear. Go that way. Ben? Everything's okay. Good afternoon, boss. You okay, sir? You tell me. Alexander. Yes, sir? I'd like Damian to lead this, please. What? Damian. I'd like to use this again later as a training sequence. Use a hands-on technique. Understood. Alexander. You and Spyder remain back until I tell you otherwise. Yes, sir. - Sir, your usual. - Thanks. Our guests will be arriving soon. Go see what's going on down there. Two o'clock. Bodyguard on main balcony. Baby. I've been waiting for you, tiger. You're not the only one, sweetheart. Mm. That's one smooth dude. Commence. Jamming... now. Hey, Jimmy. Are you picking up any interference? Excellent work, Damien. Help! Shoot! Spyder, where are you? I'm in position. Sir, Damian's under fire. Permission to engage. Nothing personal. Hey, you! No, you don't. Mission complete. Not quite. There are three bodyguards left on the perimeter. Take them out immediately. Make sure it's all on video. There's a guard on approach from behind the granite pyramid. And he's armed. Stop! Come on, baby. Shh. Spyder, Alexander. Rendezvous back in Position One in two minutes. Let's get outta here. Termination's complete, sir. Excellent work, gentlemen. Return to base immediately. Yes, sir. Computer, stop recording. Monitors off. I guess we'll need a replacement agent at the academy. It is Jordan. Jeez. Don't look good. What a waste. I heard good things about this Justin Vanier. He's Federal Security Bureau. Oh, I hope he works out. Can't afford to lose another agent. No kidding. Hold on, let me show you. Stand over here. The gun comes up. Bang, step to the side. Take him down, take the gun out. Bang, bang, he's dead. Now let's see you try it with bullets in the gun. Incoming! Get down! What kind of gun is that? Standard issue. It's called shoulder strength. Good concentration, too. That's a definite gift. Try it again, you'll get the hang of it. Yes, sir. Thank you. Yes, sir. Justin. How you doin', sir? Woods. Let's go talk over there. I didn't bring my sunblock. You guys make sure you practice. - Okay. - Uh huh. So, did you get through the file I sent you? I read it. This guy Warbeck sounds like a prince of darkness. Well, we think he is. We just need some proof. What happened to your undercover? Hmm. Now, we want you to contact this man. His name's Eric. Eric. He seems familiar. He's your contact on the inside. He's posing as an instructor. And why hasn't he called you? Well, Jordan was his only contact. He's playing it smart. He's gonna sit tight and wait 'til we get in touch with him. Warbeck's Virtual Arts Academy accepted your application. And they made a very thorough background search of you. You can't take any chances with these people. Good luck. You'll need it. VR Control, give me a level two opponent. Sonny, come on, give it your best shot. Give me a ready stance. Good. All right. Direct contact to your opponent's strike zones will give you the highest score. Concentrate, Sonny. His moves are based on what you give him to choose from. One two, one two. Complete punches, front kick. Hey! Are you trying to kill him? Get me in there! Link me up now! That still was level two! Sorry. It's a glitch. Glitch my... Hey, will you wait a minute? We're understaffed and accidents are happening. We're still trying to find a replacement for Jordan. Well, if she hadn't quit, we wouldn't have this problem. I know this isn't a good time to ask you, but could you please take the afternoon class? Sure. Thanks. Come on, I'll buy you lunch. Hey, what's with this? My card doesn't work. Could you open the door, please? This area is off limits. Let's go the other way. This place is getting outta hand. I mean, everything is so hush hush. I feel like they don't trust me. They don't. Integrated and comprehensive programs hold considerable promise for the psychologically advanced students. You are encouraged to use our resources. We are a family, here to support you. Failure to comply with the recognition of the system results in a discredit on registrants' end of term evaluation. What do you suppose Warbeck's doing that's so secret? And why don't you ask him? I was hoping you'll introduce me to him. No such luck. That's like trying to gain an audience with the Pope. Do you think there's a connection? To the agent? I doubt it. Hmm. Mr. Bromfield has arrived. Right on time. Good. Show Mr. Bromfield in. Please, come in, gentlemen. Mr. Bromfield. Mr. Warbeck. I appreciate your punctuality. I understand that we have a deal. Oh, we do, if you can deliver what you say. Well... You're not here because you think we can't, are you, Mr. Bromfield? What Mr. Bromfield is saying is he wants some sort of proof you guys aren't just full of air. Perhaps a demonstration of my staff's abilities. Would you like that? If it's possible. Ah, I got just the thing. Jesus. As you can see, I value our reputation. So, we have a deal then? The price for killing Goldberg will be three million. Three million? You said one and a half. You're not gonna charge me for him. Oh, no, we never charge for demonstrations. However, my staff has done some research, and you've neglected to give us all of the facts. It seems that killing Goldberg will net you about a half a billion dollars. And such a high profile case and the enormous amount of media attention, I feel that three million is being more than reasonable. All right. You'll have the money in 48 hours. 24. Hello, my name is Justin Vanier. I called earlier about joining the academy. You're cleared, Mr. Vanier. Proceed to the registration office. Thank you. Miss Lawson. Justin Vanier is on his way. All right, thanks. Hi. I'm Justin Vanier. I'm glad you could make it. I'm Vicki. Hi. You mind if I ask you a question? Why the guards on the way in? Security is very important around here. I'm not quite sure why. Sometimes, I think it's to give the place a more impressive image. I'm sure impressed. But then again, when you do have hundreds of people training to become lethal, average discipline won't do. And through the use of computer technology, we're able to compress as much as 20 years of experience into a two year program. Well, that's amazing. Mm-hmm. But when am I gonna learn something? Right now. This is the heart of our operations. This? Don't look like that much here. It doesn't look like that much until you put on the helmet. Then I promise you, you'll be impressed. That's what she's seeing, just like it's happening to her in real life. See, these programs are designed for training. And each student is escorted to a better sense of self being on a physical, mental, and spiritual level. She can also choose from an unlimited number of scenarios. Out of body experiences, near death, flying, scuba diving, space walking, passion, sex. Sex? You mean she can do all that inside a computer? Mm-hmm. What's so funny, Frank? Oh, jeez. I love these chop sake movies, man. You know? Hey, you ever seen the one where the old man and the son are fighting in the dark, and the old man reaches into his son's chest and rips his heart out? Jeez, I love that stuff. Four days in this place. I'm going nuts! You call this a safe house? I'm gonna get shot. He's watching television. Mr. Goldberg, with all due respect, lighten up. Nobody's gonna get shot here. Now, let's just go over your testimony for court. I can't think straight. The defense is gonna ask you why you took the job with Mr. Bromfield's company if you have so little respect for him. Now, what are you gonna say? He wasn't wearing a name tag saying Harold Bromfield, crook. It's just a job. Goodnight, Mr. Ward. I'm sorry, you've got the wrong office. Where are you holding Goldberg? What is this? From here on, it gets bloody. And painful. Where's Goldberg? I swear to you, I don't know! I was hoping you'd say that. What a lovely singing voice you must have. It's here. Counselor, you're off the case. You've done well. The results of your efforts have not gone unnoticed. We are... The force that everyone wants! We are... The future! If they only knew what I was really up to, huh? Did you get the information on Goldberg? It's all right here. Pictures? Everything. Excellent. Give it to the technician. Have him put it into the VR system immediately. I want them preparing in two hours, Damian. Illuminating the functions between emotional and psychological relationships creates an environment where students can consequently alter those situations. Well, into the belly of the beast. Hey, beginner. That's my room. I'm here. You put it on your head. Really? Everything you learn here you can practice on the outside. I don't like it. Won't work unless you wear it. Now, was that hard? I don't see anything. Wait until we start the program. The levels of conditioning are as follows. Level one is zero pain. Eric. That is, you will feel no contact from your virtual opponent or opponents, as the case may be. Level two is half what real contact would feel like. Three is full contact. Four is contact and half. Five is double contact. Our goal is to get you to that level as quickly as possible. Your opponent has been designed to attack with precise hits the moment it discovers an opening in your defense. Students are encouraged to be on the offense. Always think it's better to create an injury than to suffer one. You will temporarily feel the pain, but without the actual injury. Remember, the more you advance, the tougher your opponent becomes. Whoa. That's great, Justin. All right, let's try a more advanced level. Is that it? How about a level five opponent? Impressive. Hey! Hold it. Do you know the name Wilkinson? So, what have you learned? Jordan's gone, I haven't seen her in a week. Jordan's dead. They found her body two days ago in the lake. I'm sorry. What about Warbeck? He keeps this place air tight. Information is on a need to know basis only. What do you recommend? Whatever's going on, it's beyond these walls. Everything is run by computers. We have to access Warbeck's master control room so I could hack into his files. We'll need an access card if we're to get in there unnoticed. Leave it to me. I'll see you at the great hall at 10:00 p.m. Eric, are you okay? Yes. Are you sure? I just had some bad news. I'll be all right. This is a self expanding Kayuga steel baton. It can be used closed and concealed, or you can whip it out and use it for more effectiveness. Make no mistake. Either way, it is versatile and deadly. A weapon you can't afford not to learn and master. You two. Get started. Next position. Okay. Hojo, make your move now. Hojo, be stealthy. Billy, go! Pick it up. Alexander. That's it. Position three. Better, gentlemen. Better. Doesn't this look good? You finished yours already? Think you're pretty tough, don't you? Is that hostility I detect? You're gonna detect this, pal. Let me introduce myself. You might be able to beat that silly machine, but that doesn't mean you can really scrap. I couldn't agree more. Well, then, let's do it. Do what? Fight. What for? It's what I do. I'm gonna rip off your head! Don't you think we need to do a little warm-up before we start? What? You know, a little jogging, something to loosen up the legs. And one. And two. - Hey, hey. - And three. Break it up, that's enough. Okay, man. Okay, man. I'm cool, I'm cool. I don't know what came over him. Okay, it's clear. Slowly. I hate this techno-crap. Why don't they make keys like they make for normal locks? Where do you think you're going? This area is off limits. I'm calling security. No, you're not. Get off me! Shut up! You shut your mouth for two minutes. Two minutes only. We have to get into Warbeck's files, okay? There's more to Warbeck than you think. Sit down and shut up. Don't move. Doesn't anybody use papers anymore? You've been out of touch. Way out. What do you think all this is worth? Hundred million, maybe more. He can afford it. Not teaching martial arts. Exactly. Now let's find out what he's up to. Without a password... I'll need to find a back door. It's no good. I've got to create a new password. While you do that, I'm gonna go around and see what I can find without using the computer. That should do it. Keep training. Let the enforcers handle it. He is running an assassination business. There is enough evidence here to put him away for 10 lifetimes. What? This whole school is a front. Now that we've got the evidence, all we have to do is stroll out of here. Oh, shoot. What's wrong? You didn't... Damn it, Vicki, I told you to trust me. I thought you were industrial spies! Where's Justin? Oh, there he is. Wait, look, look. Justin. Security's onto us. Get out of there now! Now! Let's lock all the doors. Get out of the way! Yes! We'll use the other door. I've got it. - Right. - Let's go. That's my passcard. Leave the rest to me now. Gimme the disk. Why? Trust me. Jordan was my friend, too. It's been real nice knowing you. Hey, that's him! Come on. You too? That virtual reality stuff is crap. Let me show you the real thing. Come on, come on. Hey, Justin! Did you find any evidence? It's all on disk. Jump for it. Justin. Good shooting, Damian. I'll dispose of them. Hmm, not yet. They have something to give us first. Let the computer have them for a while. When the computer has all their moves, then you can dispose of them. Well, big boy. You're in for a real ride. Show us your best move, hotshot. Justin! Eric, where are you? I can hear you, but I can't see you. This damn thing is locked on me. How are we feeling? Go to hell! There's no need to be rude. Please stand. I hate this computer stuff. Who do you want for their first opponent? I don't know, Damian. Who do you have in mind? Well, I've always favored Fango. Oh, Fango. Excellent choice. If Eric broke into this, he's a better hacker than I am. Warbeck. Is that all you got? Of course not, Justin. Try one of these. Do you like that? Oh, man. Maybe. You're late. I'm sorry about that. What do you wanna do with these two? Well, I hate to leave all this fun, but Goldberg is more important. Work 'em 'til they drop. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hoo hoo, woo! Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Main monitor on. Goldberg program on. Has everything gone as planned, Damian? We're ready for anything. Woo hoo! Woo! Think you are pretty good, eh? Give me the great man, please. Oh, my God. That's just two hours away. God, I've gotta tell Eric. Right. Okay, let's make this a little more interesting. Justin. If I don't get outta here and you do, you make sure you express to Warbeck how I feel. Count on it. You do the same for me, okay? You got it. Hi. I'm having trouble opening this. Could you help me, please? You'll see! Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Wa hoo hoo! Woo! Hey, you are not allowed in this area. Abort this program. You are making a serious mistake, young lady. Are you all right? God, I thought you were dead. So did I. Look, we don't have much time. Warbeck is gonna assassinate Goldberg. Let's get Justin. Come on. Hey, how you feelin'? I'm okay. Warbeck's going to assassinate Goldberg. That man is our star witness. Where's Warbeck now? I don't know. But I just saw Damian and Alexander leave a little while ago. You guys, help me take this crap off. All right, come on. Let's go. Is this your truck? Yeah, so? All right, everybody move into position one. There are four people inside. Goldberg and three cops. Yes, I heard. All right, let's not have any slip ups. This should only take a minute. We've done this a dozen times. So let's not make any mistakes. Spyder and I will approach from this side. Let me know when you're in position. You do have the rest of the money with you, correct? Right here. Have we got the target on screen? Negative. No one's gonna in or out since we arrived. Goldberg's in there, alright. Level the entire building and get back here. No, I want proof that Goldberg's in there. I'm not paying three million to see you blow up a shed. I want to see him die. Mr. Bromfield, I don't recommend that you tell me how to conduct my operation. It's not healthy. I see him die or the deal's off. Very well. Sit down. Hold on, Damian. You and the others remain in your current positions. We have a request that the execution be seen. Hey, Frank. Twenty bucks says your replacements are gonna be late. You're on. Um, they're already late. What? They still got 10 minutes. He changed your watch. You shits. Great! Wonderful, wonderful. I hate babysitting. Ah, put yourself in his shoes. You'd be scared shitless, too. Brace yourself, Mr. Bromfield. I still want to see Goldberg dead. It's painfully obvious you're not cut out for this, Mr. Bromfield. You don't have to watch. I'll be fine. What's taking him so long? I'll check it out. Don't play games, Frank. Alexander. He's directly behind you, gun in right hand. All right, Frank, I'll give you your 20 bucks back. Hope you guys got a toilet. Yeah, in there. Three more cops have just arrived. If you guys were any later, I'd have to send a search party out for you. Commence the execution. Man in the window. I have a clear shot. Take him. Not bad, Spyder. You sure this is the place? Yes. Well, this was unaccounted for. Stay down! Man, did you bring a gun? Didn't you? I can't believe you guys were parked in the middle of a shootout and you didn't bring a gun. I'll go get one. If they're still shooting, Goldberg's still alive. Oh, man! Oh. Cover me! I got your back! I'm a cop! I'm a cop! Are you Goldberg? Yeah, get me outta here! Get down! What was that? Come on, let's see some strategy out there. Damian. That was an unacceptable performance level for Alexander. Kill him. That's a lot of expensive training down the drain, sir. He knew the risks. He's history. I haven't had iguana since El Salvador. Sorry, Alexander. Vicki, you stay put. I'm going to help Eric. Where are they? Oh, man. Oh, man! Ah! Eric? Are you all right? Where's Goldberg? He went that way. I'll get him. Wait here. There he is. That's him! Kill him. Kill him! Move! Damian. Abort mission now. Return to base immediately. He's getting away, you can't stop now. It's over. We'll get him later. And you'll get your money later. There won't be a later for you. Calm down, calm down. Calm down, calm down. Don't kill me, don't kill me! - I'm not gonna kill you! - Don't kill me! I'm not gonna kill you. Looks like the day won't be a total loss. Bring her to me. - No! - Calm down. That's Goldberg. I'm Goldberg. I'm Goldberg. Where's Vicki? - There she is. - Come on! I'll take that. Let's go. Hey! Hey! Don't leave me here! Come on! Where are the keys? Sir, we're en route now. Bring the prisoner in. We have a change of plans. Shouldn't we radio for backup? It's our mess, let's go clean it up. If only you had kept an eye on her. Don't even say it. I was looking after Goldberg. You should not have left her alone. Oh, now it's my fault? You're supposed to be protecting me, not chasing after them! Shut up! Stop the car. I don't think so. Let go of him! They're getting away. This crate won't go any faster. If you'd learned how to drive, we would've gotten there by now. Arguing won't help! - Shut up! - Shut up! We got company. They're gaining on us. Oh, wonderful. A Sunday driver. I'll take care of 'em. Drop dead! Get me out of here! We're gonna die! Take the wheel. Justin. No, no, Justin! Take 'em out, now! Die, you scum. Come on, get out! We're sitting ducks, come on! Goldberg. Eat this. He got out the other side. Run for it! Goldberg, Goldberg, where you goin'? I would've been safer in their car! That oughtta slow them down for a while. Let's get Warbeck. Come on! This time, I'm driving. It's yours. - Hey, hey! - Hold it, stop the car. - Excuse me. - Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am, we need your car. - Hey, hey! - Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. It's a police business, ma'am. - What are you doing? - Bye! Thank you, thank you. - What are you doing? Stop! That's my husband's car! You betrayed me. You ran to my enemies without even a thought. What did I do to you that was so terrible? You kill people. Yes. That's true. But so what? The government of this country kills people every day. If the government can kill, why can't I? Because you're not the government. If I have as much power as the government, then why am I so different, hmm? Your worldview is very conventional, Vicki. I don't think you think about issues such as power, authority, and the right to kill. Who gives the government the right to kill? God? I think not. The people. And if the government represents the wishes of the people, then isn't it the people that kill? People like you? Oh, Vicki... Why can't people understand such a simple concept? You are mad. Mad? Mad? What an obvious and ordinary thing to say. Our time here is done, Damian. Have Spyder set the charges. I know a wonderful little castle in Spain that will be perfect for our new operation. Those two heroes will be arriving soon. How shall we greet them? Ah, yes. The heroes. Well, if we have heroes on their way, we must give them a damsel in distress to rescue. We can arrange that, can't we? A little gift for the cowboys? Use that wonderful imagination of yours, Damian. Eric! Justin! Just hang in there, Vicki. We're coming for you. No, you can't. What do you mean no? They've set bombs everywhere, this whole place is gonna blow. And you gotta get the students out! Well, we can't leave you here. There's no time! You go for her, I'll go for Warbeck and the bombs. Where are these bombs? The boiler room! Nice place you got here. Nice place to die, too. Take him out. Good kick. Oh, Justin, come on. You can do better than that. Spyder, come on, hit him! Kick him! Damn it! Fight him! It's all over for you, chump. It's time for some steam cleaning. If you need the job done right, you gotta do it yourself. Justin. Justin, I know you can hear. One final game. Just you and me. Come out, come out, wherever you are. You're getting warmer. Well, Mr. Virtual Reality himself. You're under arrest. I got your bombs and I got you now. You'll have to find me first. What are you talking about? I'm taking you down right here. You're not paying attention. You'll have to put those on. I'm not playing your damn games. Fine. Then arrest me. My world is the electronic universe, Justin. Do you have the courage to join me there? I'll meet you anywhere. I'm waiting. Warbeck! I'm here. By the way, Justin. Those bombs? You missed a few. Eric! Vicki! Vicki, come on. Well, look what I've caught in my trap. It's all over, Warbeck. Oh, no. It's over for you, Justin Vanier. You haven't accepted the future. I... I represent the new human being. One that will thrive in the new world, where information is valued above all. My knowledge is stored. Not only in my brain, but in a global network of computers. I am more than my body. I am in my body and outside my body. The world belongs to me. Your world is dead, look at it! Nothing's real. You can't know my world, Justin. But it is as real as yours. The only difference is... I am in complete control. Expect no mercy. I'm glad it's you, Damian. You won't be. Come on, hotshot! That's a very bad habit you have, killing people, you know. Sometimes, I really enjoy it. Like when I did Jordan. Now that was a lot of fun. Vicki! I was really expecting much more from you, Justin. I guess heroes aren't what they used to be. This is one opponent you can't shut off. You surprised me. I didn't think you were this good. You surprised me. I didn't know you could think. Eric! Eric! Vicki, Vicki! Grab the rope! Hang on. God. Let's get outta here. Everybody evacuate, the building's gonna blow! Welcome back to reality. - Hey! - Hey, Justin! Did you get the bombs? There wasn't enough time, we better get out of here! And Warbeck? He's gonna have a different view for a long time. Computer warlord. Were you ever worried? Me? Are you serious? I think Warbeck was only the first in a whole new breed of criminal. The cyber criminal. And now it's over. Or is it?
