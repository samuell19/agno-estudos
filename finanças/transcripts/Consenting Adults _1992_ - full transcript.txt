Richard, hold it. Richard, what's the matter? I'm not selling these skis to my mother. Please, a more neon sound. Remember: to be free, to soar like an eagle... to slip the surly bonds of Earth. Right? That's the feel. Here we go. The guys are tired, you know? If the guys are tired, it sounds that way in the ad. - All right. - Cut! They've never let you down before, Jimmy. They've never let you down. Richard, listen, we talked about this yesterday... and I'm not getting the sound that we're looking for. Look, we're all tired, but we might as well not be recording this... unless we're going to get some punch. Now, maybe my ears are clogged or something, but it's- - Jimmy, we agreed on this yesterday. - Say it'. Tell me. We've been playing a long time. We need a lunch break. Why don't we just get through one track, one take... - and then give us your notes, okay? - Okay but I want... We can fix it in the mix. We can do it in the mix, but I want to hear it in the performance too. - Just surge. - I want a. Whee! - Jimmy! - Richard, look... It's not the fucking "Leonora Overture, " okay? It's a jingle. Just let us get through it once, okay? And then we'll have lunch, and then we'll have notes... and then we'll fix it in the mix, okay? Hey! Mom wants you to come home right now! She's waiting for you. If she can stand it, I can. Play it. Yes, boss. I think we should apologize To Jimmy Schwartz tomorrow. And ready, pull! Wish for something expensive. - Mom. - Mom! - Good-bye. - Okay. Take care. Say hi to your mom. Nice party, Mrs. Parker. - Thanks for coming. - You're welcome. You're welcome. I guess we have new neighbors, eh? Hey, you mind if I run along with you? No, be my guest. - Richard Parker. - Oh, hey. Eddy Otis. Where's your beautiful daughter today? She's away at school. She comes home every other weekend. Uh, whereabouts? It's a couple of hours from here. It's a school for musically-gifted children. Oh, you must be very proud. You could say. Let me guess. You're in something to do with the arts. Maybe graphics, maybe advertising. No, definitely advertising. I'm a composer. I write jingles for ads. How did you guess? I used to sell insurance. You get a feel for stuff like that. What do you do? I'm not even gonna guess. - I give financial advice. - Oh, like what? - Okay, health clubs. - Good, huh? - Lousy. Trust me. - Oh. Home security? - Better? - Oh, much better. He said they didn't know anyone, that they were lonely. - What could I say? - Do you need these? Mmm. And this. I know how you feel about neighbors, but it's only drinks. I don't drink. Since when? I thought I was getting fat. You didn't notice. What? The getting fat or the not drinking? Jamaica for the weekend scuba diving. Anyway, on our way to the airport to come back we get caught in a riot. I swear to God, a riot. It was fascinating. While I'm so busy protecting my wife... I don't notice them stealing all the luggage. Hence, the outfit when we arrived. Everything else was packed. Have you never been in a riot, Priscilla? Sorry I'm late. I'm Katherine... but everybody calls me Kay. Kay, this is Richard Parker... and his lovely wife, Priscilla. The way I look at life, the way I look at it is this: money is like blood. It's no big deal, but if you want to live... you've gotta have a lot of it pumpin' through the system. Most people will never know what it's like to drive a boat at 100 miles an hour... or go to Jamaica for the weekend or see the Grand Canyon from a hot air balloon. You see what I'm saying? Without money... you shrivel up. So how do you explain all those shriveled up rich people? I'll tell you how. Because those people know how to make money... but they don't know how to spend it. Getting money's easy. We have to talk. - What would you invest in? - Myself? - Yeah. - Drug and alcohol rehab centers. I'm serious. It's the number-one investment op of the '90s. Priscilla, people are sheep. You tell them they can't quit on their own and suddenly everybody needs help. I mean, the human mind. What can you say? - If I had some serious money Come on. Help me out here. ♪Don't put no headstone on my grave ♪ ♪ All my life I've been a slave ♪ ♪ And I don't want the world to know ♪ ♪ Here lies the fool who loves you so ♪ ♪ Free from all this ♪ ♪ Misery ♪ Richard. Come to bed. You know, me and Kay were saying, you two have really got it made. A nice home, a nice business... a beautiful, talented daughter... a great marriage. I'm very lucky. What's the trick? - To which? - Marriage. How do you hold it all together? Trust, I guess. Trust. That's very interesting. I'm planning this trip down to South Carolina this weekend. I'm flying down in my plane. I got some property to check out. Why don't you and Priscilla come along? - You have a plane? - Just a little twin engine Piper. Well, I'm sure we'd love to, but- - If money's a problem- - It's not money- - We'll have fun. - Let's just, uh- - Do you think we ought to- - Now, watch this. Eddy, careful! Eddy! Well, let's say 5,000. With 5,000, I'd put one in the bank, one in bonds... and play the stock market with the rest. The stock market? - Mm-hmm.Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. How come you never pursued a singing career? There's a lot worse voices out there. I guess Eddy got all the self-confidence. Maybe I can help you. That way I'd get to play some blues, and- You know, you- I would take this wall out. You know, take it out, make this whole area screened in. It would open it up a lot. Then put blue shutters on it to give it a bit of life. It could use it. - What? - Nothing. Go ahead. I'm being my usual self, right? - No, I like it. - I'm gonna take over. Oh, never mind. Come on. I'm surprised Priscilla hasn't tried... to sell off some of her investments. She was up to 15,000 last time I went over it. Fifteen from five? She has a good head on her shoulders. Squeeze when you come up. That five was a gift left by an uncle to go towards a sailboat. Can't touch that. How much do you owe? It's not that much. Let's not talk about it. No, Richard, I'm serious. Maybe I can be of some help here. You can't be, believe me. Is there anything we can't talk about? Now, come on. - You really want to know? - Yes. Current debts, credit cards, bank loans, about 25,000. Is that all? I can get you that in an afternoon. How? Leave it to me, Bubbi. Three to six weeks, okay? - What Kind of interest are we talking about? - No Kind of interest. I don't loan money to my friends. It's a gift. Our greatest glory, Dicky boy, is not in never falling... but in rising every time we fall. You left yourself open for that one. You deserved it. Now, come on, come on, that's it. Come on. That's right. Come on, that's it, that's it. Hit my hand. That's it. Come on. Keep it in. Keep it in. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Eddy. - Call an ambulance. - Oh, Richard. - Thank you, Dr. Pettering. - Talk to you tomorrow. You know how to reach us. Call if you need anything. I will. Thanks a lot. - Take care. - Oh, my God. - Poor guy. I feel terrible. - He didn't look as bad as I thought. Didn't he say he was coming to take us out to dinner? - Everybody, five minutes. - Okay. Priscilla, could you come here and help me? Sure, sure. What is it? I'd like to get up. - I've been lying in the same position too long. - Okay, okay, here. - You grab on to me. - Okay, be careful, please. - I will. I will. Now, on three, okay? - Okay.Wait. Ready? One, two- - Up... we go. - Wait, slow. - Oh, slow. - You all right? Here you go. - Yeah. Oh! Oh! - Okay, Richard. Richard! Don't touch me. Don't- Just give me a little air. I can't move. I can't move. Or can I? Oh! Oh, that's much better. Well-Well, what's this? Your insurance company. Neck and back scares the shit out of them. I'm in the business, pal. It was easy. I got this pet doctor. It was nothing. Oh, I'm gonna keep five... if that's okay with you guys. Yes... Priscilla, it's true. It was a scam. And I'm- I'm terribly, terribly sorry. You broke the law, Eddy. For us? What are friends for? Oh, I don't think we can accept this. - We appreciate it. We really do- - I love this woman. "I don't think we can accept it"? It's not that we don't need the money. Priscilla, please, don't insult me. I did this for you. For you. Now, come on. I've been wearing that neck brace for weeks. What do you say? I don't know what to say. But thanks. - Can't sleep? - No. You think too much. What about you? Is Priscilla asleep? What about Eddy? No. He's at the Watkins's... you know, the people that own the cabins. Probably trying to buy the place. Always looking for a deal. How long you been married? Thirteen? Fourteen years. Have you been faithful all those years? Yeah. What about you? I guess I'm kind of old-fashioned that way. I guess we both are, huh? Lori? Hi, honey. It's Mom. Yeah, we're in a bar.

You think you can be alive without taking risks. - There's a lot of different ways- - No, you do. That's why you end up living this 50*** existence... when there's a 100*** waiting out there to be had. You're full of fear. Your life is choked. You write jingles when you'd rather be doing albums. You do it for money, but you're always in debt. You wanna make love to my wife... but you're afraid you'll get caught.

You've lost your juice. It's no big deal. It's your life. Make a fist. Too tight? You really amaze me, Richard. Just when things start getting interesting, you go cautious on me... climb back into your little shell. What about Priscilla? Hasn't she told you how much more alive she feels? Eddy, goddamn it. That's enough, okay? The subject is closed. It's not gonna happen. I hope we can stay friends. I don't know. You make me feel bad. You're so judgmental. I'm not judgmental.

Samples taken from the victim's body prove you had sex with her... within a half hour of her death. Otis claims you had an obsessive fixation on his wife... and the murder weapon has your prints on it. - We played softball that afternoon. - Yes. Meanwhile, Otis says that your story... about crossing back and forth during the night, et cetera, is nonsense... and says that immediately after dinner, around 9:00 p.m... he departed for Appalachia Lake, leaving his wife behind. That's a five-hour trip. Luke Watkins of Watkins Fishing Lodge... says Otis woke him at 2:00 a.m. for the keys. It's a lie. The time of death has been set between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m. If Otis's story is true, the closest he could have been to his wife... at the time she was killed was somewhere in the middle... - of the Chattahoochee National Forest. - I'm telling you, it's a lie. If I were you, I'd consider some kind of plea. Otherwise, unless we can break Eddy's alibi... you could be in deep, deep shit. Knee! down. Hands behind your head, please. Okay. Are they treating you okay? Don't worry about me. How's Lori? What do I tell her? Tell her the truth. Tell her the truth. This is a nightmare. You have to help me understand this, Richard. Please, help me. Please. I thought it was what everyone wanted. It seems like everyone was pushing me to do it, even you. Who was pushing you to kill her? Are you insane? Priscilla, I didn't kill her. Richard, you just said you- Mrs. Parker, to the best of your knowledge... did any other person, other than your husband... enter your room the night of the murder? No. No, of course not. That was your story, Richard? I thought that was something the papers made up. You please, you please, think of some other defense, please! How could this have happened? How could you have done this to Lori, Richard? How could you have done this to our, our family? Richard? Oh, God! Everyone told me not to come here today... but I couldn't let anyone else do this for me. I suppose I never was as strong as I pretended. And I don't have the strength... to be both the good wife... and the good mother. So I'm going to be the good mother. I want to take Lori away from all of this. I want my name back. I want a divorce. Lori is in hell, Richard. And I can't save you both. This defines the financial terms of the divorce... to the satisfaction of the bondsman. Along with your car and musical instruments... this pays my initial fee and secures the bond. She's being very generous, acting so fast. You have 24 hours to remove whatever personal effects... you want from the house. The rest will be sold at auction to pay for your defense. And don't get into any trouble. Oh, Jesus! Who the hell are you? My name is David Duttonville. I'm a private investigator. I, um- I'm gonna sit down now. You scared me. Door was open. I used to live next door. - I was just- - Yes, I know who you are. I thought you were still in the, uh- I made bail. Great. My company, Duttonville Research... it's been hired by three insurance companies... to investigate a total $1.5 million double indemnity claim... by Eddy Otis. On his wife, Kay Otis. In fact, we were hopin' that you might be able to help us. $1.5 million? Yes. That's the point. It is rather a lot to take out on a would-be lounge singer... who never earned a cent in her entire life. However, there's no law against it. She had a policy on him in the same amount. Eddy's explanation is that they loved each other so much... he figured if either of them got killed... they'd need a lot of compensation. It's a funny attitude. But the world is a funny place. So he went back in there... and he beat her to death... for money. Just as simple as that. Isn't that amazing? I even think he liked her. You're saying he killed Kay Otis? Of course he killed her. But what a setup! The whole thing just so he could- $1.5 million. I checked his alibi. It's gonna hold. What about the people at the lodge? I wonder how much he paid them? Me too. But who is Eddy? Where'd he come from? I was hoping you knew. He told me he was a financial advisor. Great. Now I know. I'm on this for a week. There's a limit to what one can do in a week. I need something solid. You got anything? Just what I already told them. The police know about the insurance, I suppose. They're not interested. I think they feel comfortable with you. Comfortable? You know what I mean. They got a good case. Look, you got my card. You think of anything, you give me a call. Oh, and by the way, in case you're interested... when I interviewed Otis, he was with your spouse. The grieving widower comforting the lonely wife. I'm gonna get going. Good-bye. I'm Richard Parker. Why are you doing this to me? - Who is it? - Call the police. Get my gun, then call the police. I've lost my wife... my child... my home. I'm facing a death sentence or life imprisonment. Call the police. How do you sleep at night? Damn it, woman, call the police. Didn't he pay you enough to kill me? Richard, uh, this is George Gordon. I'm afraid we failed in getting a further postponement of the trial. The trial will be in three weeks. I do have to say I would advise you to reconsider your plea.

Next- Kay? Sorry. What happened to the contest? Contest? There was a blues contest on the radio. I was just listening to it. Oh, that was last week. You must have been listening to a repeat. There was a singer, Olivia Kamen? Oh, she won. When we went looking for her to give her the prize, she lit out. Didn't leave an address or nothing. What did she look like? What does she look like? Ooh, she looked good. Thank you. Thank you very much. And thanks to our friend that we haven't seen in a long time. Tip your bartenders and waitresses... and remember, we love you. We thank you for loving the music. Drive safe on your way home. Good night. - That's her voice. I'd know it if she was singing underwater. So, who got killed that night? I don't know. We gotta exhume the body and get a closer look. Can't exhume the body. It's cremated. I checked on the way over. Besides, Otis is not the only one who identified the body. Someone else? A doctor. - A doctor? - Yeah. I bet you $1,000 if you call my insurance company... you will see that same doctor's name on an insurance claim... that Eddy made when he faked an accident involving my car. You're suggesting that Otis... went out and hired someone... Probably. Who resembled Kay, so you could make love to her... and he could then beat her to death. Yes. I'll think about it. ♪ From all the trouble you caused me ♪ Okay, okay, she's got a nice voice. Turn her off before I break down and cry. Do you have any other recordings? - Like what? - Recordings like she made before she died. I told you, she didn't record anything. That's my point. No, that's my point. We have no comparison. A broad in some club in Five Points... sounds like some broad who got snuffed in Huntcliffe... according to you, the accused snuffer. I go into court with a thing like that, they'll laugh in my face. And the initials K.O., O.K., Olivia Kamen- Oh, please, please, Mr. Parker... I'm an old man. Does it fall to me at this time of life to have to explain... the fundamental principles of the judicial system to a man of your intelligence? Evidence, dear boy. Evidence. So find it, you old bastard. Find it. Help me up. - Don't slam the door. - Bye, Dad. No fighting. I mean it. You called me. Yeah. I thought you'd call me back. I normally don't do business here at my home. What'd you find out? - Have a seat. - Ready or not, here I come. There's not a trace so far. But there was a woman disappeared that night, similar appearance. Hi, honey. The boys are waiting for you to play basketball. This is Richard Parker, that insurance case- Hello, Richard. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - We'll be finished in a minute. - I'm gonna start dinner. Sorry to intrude. But I did find the doctor who signed that death certificate. Name's, uh, Dr. Pettering. He also signed Eddy's injury claim. Seems he was a promising young doctor in Chicago... till he got greedy and blew himself up. He's got a scar down one side of his face. Yeah, otherwise he's real good-lookin'. A month after the murder... he and Eddy went into partnership. They call it a residential treatment center for addictive disorders. There is a third partner. A third partner. Partner in both senses of the word. Do you catch my drift? Your wife... Priscilla. If Eddy catches you prowling around his property... he will have your bail revoked. He's got my wife and child. Do any of you feel qualified to deal with him... or do we bring somebody else in? Is that a possibility, or is that pretty much a moot point? - Hello. - I got your message. Didn't I tell you not to go to Charleston? Why didn't he kill the real Kay? It would have been a lot easier. Maybe they were partners in it. Maybe he liked her too much. - I don't- - Maybe they're still in touch. It's a possibility, I guess. It's my last possibility. You don't seem depressed like you used to. These are so special. Mom, I really want this. - Hello. Hi, Eddy. - Priscilla, hi. - Did you get the samples? - Yeah, I got them. I'm on my way. - Want to go out to dinner tonight? - I think we should stay in. Lori goes back in a few days and she seems a bit upset lately. So, it'd be great if we could spend the night in the house. - I'll see you in a little while. - Love you. Okay. Bye-bye Richard, go away! - Leave me alone, Richard! - Priscilla! - Don't! - Listen to me! Don't hurt me, please. I'm not gonna hurt you. - I want you to play this for Eddy. It's Kay. She's alive. It was another one of Eddy's scams. This one was for a million and a half. Oh, Richard. Ohh. Just play the tape... for Eddy... tonight. May I go now? - You'll play it? - I'll play the tape.

That night after we played baseball... he told me to go up to the lake to Watkins' Lodge and stay out of sight. You drove the Mercedes with the cigarette boat. The next morning, he shows up on his motorbike. We go out on the lake... and he tells me... everything. And then he said if I told anyone... he'd say I'd known all along. Then I went to Canada... and I tried to forget... what I did to you. Yes? There's a David Duttonville downstairs. He wants to see you. Alone. - Hi. - Hi. How was Atlanta? I missed you.
