Whisky And here we have an excellent cognac I brought from Hungary. Oh! It's good! I have French salami and cheese. Here used to be Nathan's love nest! So what's a love nest? It is just a doghouse, I came here between processes. I know this hotel for over 30 years. Previously, he was a judge, and will now be the owner of the hotel. And all of Europe will fill the refrigerator. Do not drink it so fast. I would eat something with this. Have you seen Madeleine? She sends you a big hello. Unfortunately, she had to leave the apartment. Have you been in the restaurant Baumbetera? Of course, I ordered the famous "Marche du Pla" and then a beer. Annabelle, you are living in Acre? I live somewhere far. Come, rest a bit. Aryeh... - You embarrassed? - No, I do not mind. Everything will be all right. You will like it, you will like it. She is so stunningly beautiful! So beautiful! Oh! she's so stunningly beautiful! Stunningly beautiful! Stunningly beautiful! Where's the bathroom? Toilet? Do you want coffee, Ya'ara? Ya'ara? I thought her name was Annabelle. Ya'ara is her real name. Beautiful name. Listen, isn't Korman's daughter also called Ya'ara? No! I thought you were long gone. Aren't you cold? Why are you still here, if I am are so awful? Leave me alone! You're like a child. You say something without thinking, do something without knowing why, and then blame me, because she is not ready to answer for herself. The route is from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? Yes we go to Jerusalem. What does this mean? You won't be forced to see me! Climb! What are you waiting for? You need money? Here you go! Go on! You can not be separated from me? I don't want to take the bus! Give me back my panties! They're in your pants pocket! I don't have them anymore. That were my most beautiful panties! You do not need them. Oh! And for your friend, they are not needed, even more so. You're right. No one needs them. Stop it Ya'ara! Do you want to kill us? Was that your first time, like that? Yes. And you? I've tried everything, everything, that's why it's so hard for me now. It's hard for you? Yes, to me all is boring. I know you think this is because of you, but it is not.. It's a general boredom, that's hard to dispel. I need stronger and stronger stimulation all the time until that too stops working. If a woman interests you, then fucking her will interest you, no? It's like a conversation, right? Why do you think I would be interested in conversation? I am destroying my life, and you're being destroyed by boredom. You are hungry, and I am full. And suddenly she opened the door! Oh my God! You are already awake, Moley? You have been playing tennis all this time? I was at the hospital. What? How is she? They said, that she could go home. They suspected something with her head, they did a CT scan. What? She's all right, thank God. Tomorrow morning, they'll let her go. And you were with her? I tried to call you at the university, but I was told that you're not there. I stayed home today, I didn't feel well. I called here also. I went to the pharmacy to buy some aspirin. A good thing. My head was splitting all night. It's in your bag, right? I do not like to go through it. You have looked on the table? or... next to the dishwasher! I... I... Yoni! Fuck... - Goodbye! - Goodbye! You have everything ready today, Ya'ara? I... I urgently need to go to the hospital, it's my mother. Something has happened? Yes, an accident, an auto accident. Lord, I am so sorry. Thank you very much, we all hope that she will be healthy once again. Ya'ara, your session is on Thursday. I need your master's thesis topic by then. Shira is now also involved in the competition. She has a very high level. Probably. Roses, sunflowers, gladioli... Daisies, I need daisies! Unfortunately, we have none. Hannah Korman, please. In room 80, climb the stairs. Mama! How nice that you even came. Sorry, but I could not come sooner. Of course. Your father is no better. Well? How are you? How is your hand? First, you better worry about your husband. A person was not present with him. Thank you very much. I'll come, see you later. If You don't mind, do you have a patient named Even? - E V A N Room 305. Excuse me... I'm Ya'ara. I am the daughter of Leon Korman, pharmacist, a friend of your husband. I am - Josephine. Maybe I'd better go away? Help me with a plaster? Yes, of course! Can you help me get up? Lift the back. What is this? Morphine. From your father. Want some candy? Yes, thank you very much! I remember the day you were born. On that day I met Aryeh, my husband. Where? At the Opera House, in Paris. You look like your mother? Yes, maybe a little. You are familiar with Aryeh, right? ...I saw him once... in my parents house. What is it? Quiet! Shh! Do not talk! No! No! Where is the bell? Quiet! What are you doing here, who you are you? No! What? Aryeh, it was an accident! Are you done? I came to see my mother! Who allowed you to see my wife? What the hell you want from me? Get out of here! Leave me alone! Lord of mercy, dwelling in the celestial heights grant true rest upon the wings of thy majesty, on the steps of the holy and pure, the light of heaven shining on the soul of Josephine, daughter of Abraham and we pray for her abide in heaven comfort her, because it covers so merciful in the shadow of Thy wings for all eternity and send up her soul to the site for all eternity God is the Lord, and yes my commandment be on a bed in the world. Yoni! Where's the cat? I gave it to Shira. She is happy? Yes, very happy. And you? Where are you going? And you do not know? I can only guess. I think we waited too long. And you just decided that, without me? You would have dissuaded me. And now it's too late? Yes, yes, now it's too late. Congratulations on your wedding day. Our flight is tomorrow at 9 am. What is the flight? Where to? In.. Istanbul. On our honeymoon. What? Yes, I accept, your parents helped me with money. You only need to pack. What do you think? - But we've been married so long ago... - Yes, and it's so long overdue... For three days it will be just us. I think we need it urgently. Well, what do you think? I already know all about Istanbul... "geshyuryu byuryum!" In Istanbul, it's hot or cold? About the same as here. I'm going to quickly take a shower, do you want to come in with me? You can sit on the toilet lid as before. I'll tell you about Charshi Kapali, the largest market in the world, it has 18 of the gates of entry, and if you want a coffee you must pay 3.5 million pounds I'll get it. It's probably your parents, they want to say goodbye. Hello! Yes, Aryeh. Ya'ara! Towel! "A byuryum-byuryum"! Ya'ara! Hey, what are you doing? Where is my towel? You're not going to Istanbul, right? No. I hope that someday I can explain it to you. You want a smoke? Don't forget to breathe. Aryeh! Hello! This is a voice mail! Yoni and Ya'ara... Aryeh! Aryeh! Aryeh, Aryeh, let me out! Aryeh, are you here? Aryeh! It is necessary to pick up the phone! I will take it on the other phone. Aryeh, open the door! I've got two minutes to rest. What? Has somebody seen Aryeh? Aryeh! I'm hungry! Mama! Here it is. Come on, the air is clean, there is food in the kitchen. Here, enjoy your meal. What will you drink? What did you barricade yourself from? You want to provoke me? And my mother, too, was locked in a room? And Josephine? What have you done to her? Hold your tongue, go, the door is open! I want to know what happened with my mother? If you really want to know, ask her yourself. Ask your parents. What am I, your family physician? Aryeh, are you here? Aryeh, hey! Aryeh! He is there? I came too early? No, absolutely not. I'm so sorry. Aryeh, please accept my condolences, what can I tell you... What a wonderful house, you know how to live! Alex! Sorry. - Come, I will show you the house. - I do not know why I said it. What can I do for you, tell me? Istanbul. Istanbul! It is a dream! I still have never been. There on the Golden Horn is a coffee shop... Yeah, I know this story, about a French writer and a Turkish woman. She was married, and she was sentenced to death. And the sentence was carried into execution? - She was stoned. - Oh, my God! I told Yoni, you have to go there it is one of the most beautiful places in Istanbul! Who is Yoni? Ya'ara's husband, you met him. This is their late honeymoon. - And when are they going to Istanbul? - They already left this morning. I said to Yoni, "it's great you love her, but you have to give her something else." Yes, of course! They have never traveled anywhere together. So I said, "Come on, hurry up! If only for the weekend!" With pleasure I supported the idea. After all, a happy marriage is not brought on a silver platter, true? You know best, Leon. What do you mean? Never mind, dear, absolutely nothing. You know, even if you do not believe me, I consider myself a happy man. Yes, Leon, we know, everyone knows how happy you are! Whenever I think of happiness, I see you before my eyes. Sorry, I'm going to go eat something. This is a toilet for men? Yes, right here. Sorry, Aryeh, by chance do you have a second bathroom? There's one in the bedroom, only it's not clean. That's nothing. I do not scare so easily. Aryeh, someone rang the doorbell. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. - You're not drinking? - Thank you very much. Ya'ara! Istanbul, well, you see! How did you let him go? - How could you send him to the bedroom? He wanted to write. You intentionally sent him to the bedroom. You got pleasure from it. Your father cares less if you are in Istanbul, or in my bed. Well, you're a pig. Don't you see that he closes his eyes to all that? This and all truth? What truth, what truth? Tell me! What is the truth? I'm going to clean up the table. Let me help you. I'm so tired. I know you think I am incapable of loving anyone. Maybe you're right. Your mother was the only one. I ran after her, begging her to stay with me. She said she wanted to have children. And she knew that I could not have children. They got married behind my back. My best friend. I dropped everything and went to Paris. I cursed them that their marriage would be childless. But on the day you were born, she had me beat. I understand. And with me you finally managed to get payback. Your interest was not in me, she was the only presence. Nonsense! I'm going to take a shower and then take you home. Ya'ara! Ya'ara! You have.. both of you have already returned? I did not leave, Daddy, and you know it. - What? I knew nothing. Where is Yoni? Where is Mother? - She went to the store, I think. Do you want coffee? - So tell me, how was it? - I brought you something. From Istanbul? - Yoni? My God, my God, what are you doing, Mom? - What do you think? Putting your life in order. Your husband called from Istanbul. He arrives on the first flight tomorrow morning. Where do you put the coffee? You should have asked Yoni, I do not know. - What is this? I am sick with fear, I thought you died. Anger, you got sick with anger, because you know perfectly well where I was. I knew nothing. And I do not even want to know. But what I want is that you have order in your life. Until tomorrow there is little time. But it will not work, mother. This is simply impossible. Really? We will see! Here! Here! That's all we need to bake Yoni's favorite pie. I love it. I love him. Mother, I want to tell you something! I just wanted to make sure that you arrived safely home. Come on in. Who's there? - Hello, Hannah! - Get out! Mama! - How is your hand? - Get out of here! - Mama... Why does she hate you so? You were still in a stroller, when she reached Paris. She held you in her arms and invited me to live with you both. That we bring you up together, as if you had been my daughter. - And you sent us back? Yes. I could not do otherwise. - And my father knew about this? Of course! The two of you were with me for three days in Paris. He took you back. And today, he pretends that nothing happened. After a year or two he became ill and abandoned his studies. - What happened to him? That I do not know. - He was hospitalized more than six months, I think. - He was depressed, stayed in a mental hospital. Mama! If she chose you, I would not have been born. I would have remained an unfulfilled dream. My father, perhaps, would be someone who loved to be in the present. And Josephine... and... Yoni Every night when I cried, and she had to get up. Every time I disappointed her. When I was rude and did not do my homework. Then she thought of the price she had paid for me. Why are you laughing? Because I can finally understand it. Because I finally know why she can not... love me. I must go, I must go... to Yoni. Now I know what I shall write. You're a miracle! I know, I know everything now. What, for example? I know that this is my real honeymoon. Even if it will last just a couple of minutes, the rest does not matter. And it doesn't matter if you love me or you love someone else. I know that this is my life.
