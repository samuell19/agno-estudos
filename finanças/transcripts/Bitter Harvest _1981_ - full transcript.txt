THE ONLY THING IN THEIR STOMACHS WAS AF10. NOTHING ELSE - WELL, THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. - I DON'T THINK IT'S SO INTERESTING. - NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS-- - I JUST BURIED A PREGNANT HEIFER. MY CALVES WON'T EAT. MY MILKERS ARE DOWN 50%. I DON'T THINK THAT'S SO INTERESTING. - LOOK, WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT IT'S-- - NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT I RAN A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT HERE, BUT I GOT SOMETHING. THE RATS ATE AF10, AND THEY DIED. NOW, ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS A LITTLE RESEARCH. TEST 'EM. - WE CAN'T. - WHY? - WE DON'T DO RESEARCH. - WE'RE A REGULATORY LABORATORY, MR. DE VRIES. WE HAVE ONLY A STANDARD SET OF TESTS. - WE RAN THOSE. - YEAH, WE PUT THAT AF10 THROUGH, DIDN'T WE? - YES. - SURE. HERE IT IS. FEED OKAY. - THE RATS ARE DEAD. - HAVE YOU TRIED A RESEARCH LABORATORY? - A.A.D.L., W.A.R.F., S.U.A., BARTON. - NOTHING? - NOT A THING. - I'M SORRY. - YOU'RE THE LAST PLACE. - WE'RE A REGULATORY-- - MY COWS ARE DYING, FOR GOD'S SAKE! - WE DON'T DO RESEARCH. - YOU CAN KEEP THE RATS. - COME IN. - I JUST DON'T KNOW ANYWHERE ELSE I CAN GO. all: * PRAISE TO THE LORD THE ALMIGHTY * * THE KING OF CREATION * OH MY SOUL PRAISE HIM * FOR HE IS THE THY HEALTH * AND SALVATION * ALL YE WHO HEAR * NOW TO HIS TEMPLE DRAW NEAR * PRAISE HIM IN GLAD ADORATION * PRAISE TO THE LORD * WHO O'ER ALL THINGS * * SO WONDROUSLY REIGNETH * SHELTERS THEE UNDER HIS WINGS * * YEA SO GENTLY SUSTAINETH - HERE, THIS IS THE READOUT ON THE BLOOD TEST TO YOUR CALF, THE LAST 50 FEET OF IT. THE REST IS BACK IN THE LAB. SOMEBODY FORGOT TO SHUT THE MACHINE DOWN, AND IT JUST RAN ALL NIGHT, FILLED THE ROOM UP. - OH, BOY. - AND AT THE VERY END OF THE ROLL, THEY FOUND THAT. - WHAT IS IT? - WELL, IT'S SOMETHING THAT TAKES SO LONG TO SHOW UP THAT IT'S GOT TO BE VERY STABLE, VERY HEAVY, DEFINITELY MANMADE. - WHAT? - AGAJANIAN'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW? WE'RE NOT A RESEARCH LAB. WE DON'T HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA WHAT IT IS. - ALL RIGHT, MAYBE WE COULD RUN IT AGAIN. - OH, I CAN'T DO THAT. - IF WE RAN IT AGAIN, WE MIGHT-- - WELL, SEE, UNAUTHORIZED TESTS ARE NOT REAL HEALTHY FOR MY FUTURE. - OH. - BUT I'VE COME UP WITH A NAME. IT MIGHT HELP. BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN DO. - MORTON FREEMAN? - YOU KNOW WHO HE IS? - NO. - HE'S A DOCTOR AT ST. LOUIS GENERAL. HE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK IN CHEMICAL DISEASE. IF THOSE PEAKS MEAN ANYTHING, HE SHOULD KNOW. - MORTON FREEMAN. - CALL HIM. - I'M GONNA GO SEE HIM. UH, TELL KATE. HEY, THANKS. DR. FREEMAN? - HMM? - MY NAME'S DE VRIES. I RUN A DAIRY FARM. MY COWS ARE DYING, AND NOBODY KNOWS WHY, BUT DR. DEJONG SAID HE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME. - WHAT'S THAT? - JUST TELL ME--COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT THIS IS? COULD YOU LOOK AT-- - OH, GEEZ. SORRY. - IT'S ALL RIGHT. - WHAT'D YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS? - NED DE VRIES. - MM-HMM. MM-HMM. YOU EAT YET? - NO. - NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NO. HEAVIES, I'VE SEEN THAT SOMEWHERE. TWO MAJOR PEAKS, FIVE MINOR PEAKS, TWO MAJOR PEAKS, FIVE MINOR PEAKS. LET'S ABOUT SEE HERE. YEP. NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT THAT FAST. NOW, NEVER MIND. LET'S LEAVE. I'VE SEEN IT SOMEWHERE. RINGS A BELL. OH, NO, MAYBE WE COULD GET THE RIGHT SEQUENCE. THERE YOU GO. NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE. ALL RIGHT, UP. THAT. THERE. YEAH, ALL RIGHT, MAYBE WE GOT SOMETHING HERE. NOW, LET'S SEE. NOPE, NOPE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME. - DE VRIES. NED DE VRIES. - THAT'S NOT IT EITHER. ONE MORE. WE GOT THE RIGHT SEQUENCE, BUT LET'S SEE. UH, OOPS, THERE'S ONE. FIVE. THERE, THERE, WE GOT IT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. - WHAT? THAT'S IT? - THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. SEE, LOOK. TWO MAJOR, FIVE MINOR, TWO MAJOR, FIVE MINOR. YOU GOT IT, BOY. YOU GOT IT. - KATE, KATE, I GOT IT. I GOT IT. HE'S FANTASTIC. I GAVE HIM THE GRAPH. HE LOOKED AT IT. WE WALKED AROUND. HE KEPT SAYING, "THIS RINGS A BELL," YOU KNOW. SO WE LOOKED IN THESE FILES. WE LOOKED IN THESE DRAWERS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE SITS DOWN AT THIS COMPUTER, PUNCHES IN A COUPLE OF THINGS. BANG. HE FOUND IT. - WHAT DID HE FIND? - HE FOUND IT. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. - WHAT? - COME ON. IT'S POISON. - POISON? - YEAH, THEY PUT POISON IN THE AF10. - WHAT KIND OF POISON? - P.B.B. THERE IT IS. POLYBROMINATED BIPHENYL. - WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT? - IT'S A FIRE RETARDANT. THEY PUT IT IN PLASTICS OR SOMETHING. - THAT'S IN OUR FEED? - IN OUR FEED, AND YOU KNOW WHO MAKES IT? YOU KNOW WHO MAKES P.B.B.? - WHO? - UNIFIED CHEMICAL AND SALT. - WHO ARE THEY? - THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE MAG OXIDE. IT GOES IN THE AF10. SOMEBODY HAD TO SWITCH THE BAGS OR SOMETHING. - WELL, HOW DID THEY DO THAT? - I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE, BUT I'M SURE AS HELL GONNA FIND OUT. OH, ALL RIGHT, I WANT YOU TO WAIT. YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE. - OKAY. - OKAY? - OKAY. - DON'T YOU LOOK. - I'M NOT LOOKING. - I THINK WE'D BETTER CELEBRATE. - WALTER? - WALTER. WALTER. - WHAT'S WRONG? - WE FOUND IT. - WE KNOW WHAT IT IS. - WHAT? - WELL, COME ON OVER TO THE HOUSE. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT. - WAIT A MINUTE. - OH, NO, WE'RE CELEBRATING. COME ON. - COME ON, WALTER. COME ON, IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S OKAY. - YEAH? - YEAH. - OKAY. - ALL RIGHT. - WELL, I FOUND IT LAST NIGHT. IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT HERE. THAT'S ALL THE RESEARCH THERE IS ON P.B.B. NOW, THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THERE THAT WE HAVE TO-- NO. OH, DON'T DRINK THAT MILK. THAT'S WHY I CAUGHT THE FIRST PLANE. SEE, THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW. SIT DOWN, MRS. DE VRIES. - NOW, YOU KNOW THAT P.B.B. IS TOXIC. YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, BUT SEE, THERE'S A LITTLE TWIST HERE. IT'S FAT SOLUBLE. IT DISSOLVES IN FAT. IT LOCKS ITSELF INSIDE FAT CELLS. IF A COW EATS THIS AF STUFF, THEN THE P.B.B. IS INSIDE HIM, STUCK INSIDE FOREVER. WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET IT OUT, BUT YOU SEE, COWS HAVE ONE KIND OF FAT THAT DOESN'T STAY INSIDE OF 'EM. BUTTERFAT. IT GETS PUMPED OUT IN THE MILK EVERYDAY. NOW, THERE'S P.B.B. IN THAT. I'LL TEST IT, BUT IT'S THERE, AND IT'S IN ANYBODY WHO DRANK THE MILK, LOCKED INSIDE 'EM. SEE, FROM THE FEED TO THE COW TO THE MILK TO YOU, OR THEY SAY, AT THE LAB, THAT YOU EAT THESE COWS TOO SOMETIMES? - YEAH, WELL, IF THEY DON'T PRODUCE, WE HAVE 'EM SLAUGHTERED. - WELL, IT'S IN THE BODY FAT TOO, OF COURSE. THE MEAT WILL BE-- - POISONED. - WHAT IS IT GONNA DO TO US? IS IT THE SAME AS THE COWS? - I DON'T KNOW. LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU WHY I CAME HERE. NOW, THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT-- SEE, I DEAL WITH POPULATIONS, AND I HAVE TO BE CONCERNED THAT-- SEE, YOU SOLD THAT MILK. NOW, EVERYBODY WHO DRANK IT-- - OH, MY GOD. - YEAH, YEAH, WELL-- NOW, THEY'RE SOME THINGS I HAVE TO KNOW. I HAVE TO KNOW HOW MANY FARMS GOT THAT FEED. - I-I--LOOK, I-- - HOW MANY DAIRY FARMS ARE THERE IN THE STATE? - THEY'RE ABOUT 3,000. EXCUSE ME. - 3,000. - YEAH. - THEY JUST GOT TO BE QUARANTINED. THAT'S ALL. EVERY FARMER WHO EVER LOOKED AT THAT FEED HAS GOT TO BE QUARANTINED. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. OF COURSE, THE STATE-- THEY WON'T DO IT. NOW, THAT'S THE CATCH. THEY'LL HAVE A STUDY, AND THEY'LL SET UP A PANEL. THEY'LL HOLD A HEARING, BUT THEY WON'T QUARANTINE. - WHY NOT? - 'CAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID, I GUESS. GOD FORBID THEY MIGHT HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE INDUSTRY, AND THAT MEANS JOBS, MONEY, PRESSURES, AND IT'S NOT-- - IT'S NOT IN THE BOOK. - YEAH. YEAH, IT'S NOT IN THE BOOK. I NEED YOUR HELP ON THIS. - YEAH. - EVERYBODY WHO USED IT. - I'LL GET YOU NAMES. - NO! - OH, I'M SORRY. - OH, NO, I MEAN, YOU CAN'T NURSE HER. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THE BUTTER FAT IN YOUR MILK. - OH, MY GOD. - WELL, IT'S THE SAME THING, ISN'T IT? FROM THE COW TO YOU TO-- - THE RASH. KATE? I'M JOINING YOUR PARTY. - THIS IS AN OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION. - LOOK, I'M THE SUCKER WHO GOT THE FEED, MAN. I JUST WANT TO SEE HOW IT HAPPENED. - YOU DE VRIES? - YEAH. - OKAY. WELL, LET'S START, GENTLEMEN. MY NAME'S WILLIAMS. I'M WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS IS SCHLATTER AND VINEMAN. YOU KNOW DR. AGAJANIAN, DR. DEJONG. - HEY, HEY, WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY! HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - NOW, WHO SAID YOU COULD COME IN HERE? - F.D.S. SPOT INSPECTION, SIR. WARRANT ISSUED AT 8:00 A.M. WITH THE 64TH CIRCUIT COURT, JUDGE WELLER PRESIDING. - I WANT TO SEE THAT. - THAT'S YOUR COPY, SIR. - WHAT? - P.B.B.? - MAG OXIDE? - THIS IS IT. FLAMESTAR. THAT'S YOUR P.B.B., AND SEE, THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME. YEAH, THAT'S IT. THAT'S MAG OXIDE. - CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - THERE'LL BE A PUBLIC HEARING. THERE'S ALWAYS A PUBLIC HEARING. - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED, HOW IT HAPPENED, AND WHY IT HAPPENED, AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. IS THAT ENOUGH? - ARE YOU GONNA QUARANTINE? - WELL-- - IT COULD COME TO THAT, BUT YOU'D HAVE TO-- - YOU QUARANTINE FIRST, AND THEN-- - WELL, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T. - WHY NOT? - WELL, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO-- - YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW A LOT MORE. THAT'S WHY. - WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW? IT'S POISON. IT'S IN THE MILK. FARMERS ARE SELLING IT. YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING. - IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE. - IT'S REAL SIMPLE. YOU TELL 'EM. - THAT'S ASKING FOR HYSTERIA. - SOMEBODY'S GOT TO TELL 'EM. - LOOK, MR. DE VRIES-- - I'LL TELL 'EM. - NOW, JUST WAIT A MINUTE. - YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S USING IT. - I'LL FIND OUT. - BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT. - MR. DE VRIES, PLEASE, REALLY, THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. WE CAN'T LET YOU-- IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO HAVE YOU RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE. - IT'S POISON. - HELLO? - HI, IT'S ME. - YOU'RE NOT COMING HOME? - REAL SOON. - YOU GONNA SLEEP IN THE TRUCK AGAIN? - YEAH, IT'S OKAY. - HOW'S ANDY? - HE HATES THE BOTTLE. - RASH ANY BETTER? - THE SAME. - NO WORSE, THOUGH? - NO. HOW ARE YOU DOING? - WELL, NOT REAL GOOD. - DID YOU TRY THE AF? - YEAH, AF, MILK BUREAU, PUBLIC HEALTH, AGRICULTURE. - AND NOTHING? - WELL, I STILL GOT A FEW PLACES LEFT TO TRY. - WELL, WHAT IF FREEMAN CALLS? - WELL, TELL HIM-- JUST TELL HIM I'LL GET THE NAMES. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST LIKE PULLING TEETH. THESE PEOPLE DON'T TALK, BUT TELL HIM I'LL GET HIM THE NAMES. HOW ARE YOU? - BETTER. I WISH YOU WERE HERE. - I KNOW. - IT'S JUST THAT I HATE TO SEE HIM NURSE FROM THE BOTTLE, YOU KNOW? - YEAH, WELL, I'M COMING HOME, ALL RIGHT? TOMORROW. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. - I'M OKAY. - SEE, I JUST-- I LOVE YOU. - I KNOW. - ALL RIGHT, I BETTER GET GOING HERE, HUH? I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. - OKAY. - BYE. - BYE. - WALTER? WALTER? WALTER? WALTER? - HUH? - OH, I--I THOUGHT-- WELL, YOU WEREN'T MOVING, AND... - WHAT TIME IS IT? - UH, AROUND 3:00, I GUESS. - I GOT IT, NED. - WHAT? - THE SICKNESS. I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE ALL MORNING. RIGHT HERE. I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW TO PLOW. - NED, THIS AIN'T A GREAT PLACE TO MEET. - YOU GOT TO DO ME A FAVOR. - WHAT? - TELL ME WHO'S USING AF10. - OH, GEE. - ON YOUR ROUTE. GIVE ME SOME NAMES FROM YOUR ROUTE. - WELL, HOW'D I KNOW ANYWAYS? - BUT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, HAROLD. THAT'S YOUR JOB. - HEY, I GOT TO GET OFF THIS BRIDGE HERE. - I FOUND WALTER BOWMAN SITTING ON A TRACTOR IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FIELD, JUST SITTING THERE, 'CAUSE HE FORGOT HOW TO PLOW. HE'D BEEN PLOWING ALL HIS LIFE, AND HE JUST FORGOT. YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE IT GOT HIM JUST LIKE IT GOT HIS HERD AND MY HERD AND MY BABY. - I'M SORRY, NED. - THAT'S WHY YOU GOT TO TELL ME, HAROLD. - OH-- - I'M ASKING YOU. - IT'S A STATE MATTER, NED. IT'S ORDERS. THE BOYS AT THE PLANT, THEY'D-- THEY'D HAVE MY BUTT ON A PLATE. - PLEASE? - I CAN'T. - TELL ME! YOU GET DOWN HERE AND TELL ME. YOU GET DOWN HERE AND TELL ME! TELL ME! - HEY. HEY! TRY JIM LAZLO. UP TO PEATRY. - CAN I HELP YOU? - MR. LAZLO? DO YOU USE AF10? YOU EVER HEARD OF P.B.B.? FLAMESTAR, UNIFIED CHEMICAL? MR. LAZLO, YOU KNOW WHY YOUR COWS ARE SICK? CALL THE AF? CALL THE STATE OVER AND OVER AGAIN? DID YOU TALK TO DR. AGAJANIAN? DID HE TELL YOU THERE WASN'T A DAMN THING WRONG? - NOW, LOOK, SEE HERE. I CALLED THEM BASTARDS WAY BACK IN JULY. RIGHT HERE. SEE? I CALLED 'EM, AND I ASK 'EM RIGHT THEN WAS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE FEED? THEY COME OUT. THERE WAS TWO OF 'EM, A YOUNG GUY AND THIS AGAJANIAN, AND THEY MADE ALL KINDS OF TESTS, AND THEY DIDN'T FIND NOTHING AT ALL. NOTHING--NO POISON, NOTHING. WHAT WAS IT? - P.B.B. - WELL, WELL, THEY DIDN'T FIND IT. THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. NOW, ALLS I HAVE EVER DONE IN THIS WORLD IS TAKE CARE OF CATTLE, AND I HADN'T LOST MY MIND SO MUCH THAT I DON'T KNOW WHEN A COW'S SICK. NOW, HAVE I, MOTHER? - YOU FORGET SOME NOW. - HAVE I, MOTHER? - NO, YOU HAVEN'T. - BUT I'M TELLING YOU. THEY MADE ME FEEL LIKE I HAD DONE. I SAYS TO MY SON, WHENEVER THE CATTLE STARTED DYING, I SAID, "SON, BY GEORGE, YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CATTLE." AND I DONE FORGOT ALL THAT I EVER DID KNOW. I MEAN, THAT'S HOW THEY MADE YOU FEEL. THAT AGAJANIAN-- HE SAT RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE IN THAT CHAIR AND LOOKED ME IN THE FACE AND TOLD ME THAT I WAS A BAD MANAGER. MOTHER WAS RIGHT HERE. HE WAS SITTING THERE, AND HE WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD AND SAID, "WELL, WELL, IF IT'S A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM." WELL, HELL, LOOK. JUST LOOK BEHIND YOU THERE ON THAT SHELF. THERE'S BUTTERFAT CHAMPEENS AND ALL-AROUND CHAMPEENS AND HIGH PRODUCTION TROPHIES, AND I MEAN, YOU NAME IT, AND I GOT IT. I GOT IT RIGHT THERE. I GOT IT RIGHT THERE ON THAT SHELF. - IS THE MILK STILL GOING OUT? - EVERY DAY. WHAT THERE IS OF IT. NOBODY TOLD ME... AND, UH... THERE'S THE AUCTION. I'VE BEEN SENDING THE BETTER ONES UP TO AUCTION. - YOU'VE BEEN SELLING THESE COWS? - WHO'S BEEN BUYING 'EM? - FAMILY CARE MAN. - WHO IS THAT? - IT'S BABY FOOD. - OH. - NOBODY TOLD ME. DO YOU THINK-- YOU THINK I'D BE SELLING 'EM IF I'DA KNEW? I'M A CHRISTIAN. - MR. LAZLO, IS THERE ANY SICKNESS IN YOUR FAMILY OR ANY SIGN AT ALL OF-- - JIMMY? - JIM. - JIMMY, COME HERE. COME HERE, SON. COME ON. COME HERE. TURN RIGHT HERE. - IT'S IN THE MILK AND THE BUTTER, THE CHEESE. IT'S IN THE BEEF AND EVERYTHING MADE WITH THE BEEF. PROCESSED FOODS, CANNED SOUPS, CANNED MEATS, BABY FOODS, AND THE LIST IS FAR FROM COMPLETE. MR. DE VRIES, WHO SPENT ALL HIS WAKING HOURS TRYING TO UNCOVER THIS INFORMATION, FEELS THAT HE'S BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE, AND I AGREE. IF AND WHEN THE FULL FORCE OF GOVERNMENT IS BROUGHT TO BEAR, I BELIEVE WE'LL FIND THAT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS STATE HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED BY P.B.B. - THAT IS SPECULATION. - AT THIS POINT-- - THAT IS INFLAMMATORY SPECULATION DESIGNED TO SCARE. - WELL, I HOPE IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF SOMEBODY HERE SO WE CAN GET AN IMMEDIATE QUARANTINE PUT ON THESE FARMS. - YOU'D HAVE US SHUT DOWN MAYBE A QUARTER OF THE FARMS IN THE STATE ON A WHIM? - OH, IT IS NO WHIM. - THE ECONOMIC BLOW WOULD BE DEVASTATING. - AND THEN THERE'S YET TO BE ANY DATA LINKING P.B.B. WITH HUMAN DISEASE. - ANYTHING THAT IS NOT HARD DATA IS WHIM, DR. FREEMAN. - HARD DATA? YOU MEAN TEST RESULT? - ABSOLUTELY. MR. CHAIRMAN-- - MR. CHAIRMAN, JUST A MINUTE. I'VE GOT SOME HARD DATA HERE. HERE. HERE'S A TEST RESULT BASED ON A P.B.B. FEEDING PROGRAM I RAN ON TWO GENERATIONS OF WHITE MICE. - AND WHAT AMOUNTS WERE YOU FEEDING THEM? - MR. CHAIRMAN, WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED-- - IF THEY WEREN'T FED AMOUNTS COMPARABLE TO HUMAN INTAKE, THEN THERE'S NO-- - I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED. - THANK YOU. RESULTS BASED ON THE TESTING OF 67 WHITE MICE. - MR. CHAIRMAN, WE CAN'T DEFEND AGAINST A TEST WE DON'T HAVE. - YOU KNOW, YOU CAN KILL MICE IF YOU FEED 'EM ENOUGH TABLE SALT. - THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS RECORDED. - MR. CHAIRMAN-- - GENTLEMEN, I HAVE THE FLOOR. I'M GONNA GET THIS INTO THE RECORD IF I HAVE TO STAY HERE A WEEK. - MR. CHAIRMAN-- - GENTLEMEN. DR. FREEMAN. - THANK YOU. FOLLOWING SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS RECORDED. LIVER AND KIDNEY MALFUNCTION, MEMORY LOSS, WEIGHT LOSS, SKIN RASHES, AND HAIR LOSS, INTESTINAL LESIONS, PREMATURE ARTHRITIS, INFERTILITY, SPONTANEOUS ABORTIONS, GENETIC DEFECTS, MALIGNANT TUMORS, AND DEATH. MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS IS A TOXIC CHEMICAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT. YOU CAN'T JUST INOCULATE THE POPULATION, AND IT'LL ALL GO AWAY. IT WON'T GO AWAY. IF IT GETS INSIDE YOUR BODY, IT'S THERE FOREVER, AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW IT. IT IS NOT LIKE THE MEASLES, AND THERE ARE NO SET SYMPTOMS. YOU COULD GET ANYTHING ON THIS LIST IN ANY COMBINATION OR NONE OF THEM. IT COULD LIE DORMANT WITHIN YOU FOR 20 YEARS, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'VE GOT CRIPPLING ARTHRITIS, KIDNEY FAILURE, OR CANCER. AND NOBODY KNOWS WHY, OR IT COULD SKIP YOU COMPLETELY AND HIT YOUR CHILDREN OR THEIR CHILDREN, AND GOD KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN A GENERATION FROM NOW. MR. DE VRIES' COWS ARE DYING, AND HIS BABY'S SICK, AND NOBODY GIVES A DAMN. AND THIS PANEL, THIS STATE, INSTEAD OF WORKING 24 HOURS A DAY TO CONTAIN THE PROBLEM, IS TRYING ITS HARDEST TO MAKE IT SEEM UNIMPORTANT. MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU A WARNING. THERE IS, AT THIS MOMENT, AN ODORLESS, COLORLESS, TASTELESS POISON IN YOUR FOOD CHAIN, AND IT'S SPREADING UNCHECKED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND UNLESS YOU CUT OUT THE CAUSE IMMEDIATELY, UNLESS YOU QUARANTINE NOW, YOU FACE AND YOU WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A DISASTER WITHOUT PRECEDENT. - HERE IT IS. "IN A DECISION RELEASED TODAY "BY THE PANEL FOR CHEMICAL DISEASE STUDY, "A SPOKESMAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE SPREAD OF P.B.B. "HAS BEEN CHECKED, "AND THE SMALL AMOUNTS ALREADY INTRODUCED INTO THE MILK SUPPLY "ARE NOT A THREAT TO HEALTH. "THE SPOKESMAN WENT ON TO SAY "THAT ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE PREFERABLE "NOT TO HAVE P.B.B. IN FOOD AT ANY LEVEL, "A PROPER BALANCE OF SAFETY AND ECONOMIC CRITERIA "MUST BE MAINTAINED. "THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE MUST NOT BE THREATENED "BY AN OVERREACTION TO AN ISOLATED PROBLEM. "THEREFORE, IT IS THE PANEL'S OPINION THAT A QUARANTINE "WOULD DO SUBSTANTIALLY MORE HARM THAN GOOD "AND IS NOT BEING CONSIDERED AT THIS TIME. - THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING? THEY'RE JUST GONNA LET IT SPREAD? - WHO'S GONNA STOP 'EM? - WELL, WE ARE. AREN'T WE? - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - NED, AREN'T WE? WHAT'S THAT FOR? - YOU KNOW. PEOPLE GOT TO SEE IT. IT'S THE ONLY WAY. ISN'T IT? - YES. - COME ON. - COME ON. COME ON. - COME ON. - GO. GET GOING. - ATTAGIRL, COME ON. YOU MILKED HIM. - TO GET MORE COMFORTABLE. - I WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU. - WASN'T MUCH MILK. - I THINK I'M GONNA GO IN THE HOUSE NOW. - I CAME BY. I FIGURED MAYBE I COULD GIVE YOU A HAND. I KNOW THESE COWS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY. THEY'RE WAITIN' FOR YOU. - BRING 'EM UP. - COME ON. - COME ON, GIRL. - COME ON. - COME ON, COME ON. - GO. - OKAY, SWEETIE. OKAY. SWEETIE. YEAH. OKAY. - HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. - COME ON. GET IN THERE. GO. - LET'S GO. LET'S GO. COME ON. GET ALONG. HERE WE GO. GET IN THERE. COME ON.
