Danielle is going to love my designs. She is going to love my designs. [exhales] I sought simplicity in both efficiency and aesthetic with neutral centerpieces, clean white table settings and an agreeable surf and turf menu. It's by the book... But the Essential Events way. The client will love these. I am so happy to hear you say that, because I had some extra time and... I wanted to present the client with something a little more personal. They mentioned a love of nature, so I adjusted the entryway to reflect that. And, I also looked into napkin origami to spice up the table settings a little. It is a paper company, after all. Emma, these are incredible, but I'm afraid the client won't love this. It's just the reality of corporate events. Pragmatism over personal touch. I understand. I figured it was worth a shot. And hey, now I know how to turn a napkin into a duck in under five minutes. [laughs] Leave it to you to find the silver lining. Which reminds me, we're opening a new firm in Seattle and my partners have asked me to find a candidate to lead it. I immediately thought of you. Oh, wow, thank you, Danielle, that sounds like a huge opportunity. Well it would be but it would mean you relocating to Seattle. You would oversee our entire client schedule and you'd be the queen of corporate events there. That's quite a title. [phone chimes] Oh. Oh, it's your sister's engagement party tonight, right? Technically it starts in 20 minutes. But, if I leave here in three minutes I can still get there with two minutes to spare. You know, why don't we do something crazy and let you off early so you can have two minutes to spare and three minutes to relax? - Relax? - Mm-hm. That's not something I do often. I know. I know, so go. Get out of here. ♪ Step away from the flowers or I erase the sign. Miranda Hall, you wouldn't dare. Oh, Emma Hall, I would. This is my engagement party! Not one of your corporate events. I spent three hours on that sign. I even took a calligraphy course for you. They have those? The internet has everything. Which, if I remember correctly, you said you wouldn't plan my wedding. Not wouldn't, couldn't. Ah, and yet, here you are, arranging flowers and writing beautiful hashtags. I know, but planning a whole wedding is so different. It's one of the most important days of your life. Trust me, if you're gonna hire someone to do it, you want someone with experience. Well, unfortunately not a whole lot of people want to plan a wedding in six weeks. Which is why, I decided to do it myself. Not a whole lot of people want to plan anything in just six weeks. Are you sure you can't wait just a little longer? Our five year anniversary is the perfect date and you could throw a million wedding details at me... But the date is the only one that matters. I know. Although, I have to say, this venue is looking pretty good too. I, I can't believe we got this place for our wedding. It's perfect. Also, what are you wearing? Oh, compliments of cousin Becky. Don't worry. She has a sash for you too. Hide me. Only if you promise to talk to at least one single guy here. Ok, now you sound like Mom. And we both agree, it's time for you to, you know, put yourself out there. Speaking of that, have you met... Jamal? Brett's college friend from Singapore? Yeah, met him. Great guy. Really into Ferris Wheels. That sounds interesting. So, he's passionate. He also lives 9,400 miles away. Well, I, you're my sister, and I love you, I do. But I'm really worried that you're focusing so much on everyone else's dreams that you're forgetting about your own. Now she really sounds like me. Mom. You did not have to bake anything for today. But these are your milestone macaroons. I made them for every graduation. Your first dance, and when you passed your driver's test. Uh, you also made them when I failed my driver's test. Yes. And when you went to try again, you passed. And you're welcome. [laughs] Miranda, oh, this is such a beautiful space for your engagement party. Oh, and don't forget, the wedding too. See? And this venue is totally cool with a six-week heads up. And Emma, did you see the caterer? Ooh. Around your age. Ok, why is it always about my dating life? Mom, you know I've been telling you to start putting yourself out there again. And I will. I will, um, in my own time. But for now, I wanna take good care of my daughters. Oh, I think it's time for speeches. On that note, Mom, Emma, will you please gather everyone for the speeches? Both: On it. [children playing] - I did it! I did it! - I'm doing it, too! Hey kids, it's time to come inside. [bell dings] Incoming! Hey! This is an engagement party, not a circus. Emma? Liam. Hi. It's been a while. A year. Not that I've been counting. I see you're still biking. Kind of have to when you own a bike shop. Right. How are things at your shop? Good. Great, actually. We just got a new shipment in of tandem bikes, if you ever want to give it another try. [chuckles] I'm good, thanks. I have to say, I haven't crashed since then. Until now, when you almost ran into me? I was only going so fast because... You were late? Hm. Reminds me of our first date. And only date. Emma! Emma! Don't move. If you missed me this much, a hug would have sufficed. Oh, dream on. Just hide me. I got an idea. Hey, kids! Guess what time it is? It's ice cream time! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! [kids screaming] Children: Ok, ok, ok. Let's get some ice cream. Well, thank you. No problem. I'm gonna go. Yeah. Yeah. ♪ [crowd chatting] - Oh! - Hi. The best looking man at the party. - How're you doing? - Thanks for coming. - Nice to see you, Liam. - Same here. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetheart. - How's it going? - Good, good. Mel, it's so good to see you. Hi! Liam. - You look lovely. - Thank you. Wait, how do you know my mom? Liam came over for dinner with Brett and Miranda a while ago. They wanted me to get to know their best man. You're the best man? Best friend, best man. Usually that's how it works. That's not a problem, is it? No, not at all. And Maid of Honor... Speaking of, Emma, honey. Maid of honor's up next. Thanks. And you're Maid of Honor? Sister, Maid of Honor, tends to work out that way too. [glasses clinking] Guess that's my cue. [microphone feedback] I am calm and confident. I am brave and balanced. They're gonna love my speech. They are gonna love my speech. [laughs nervously] Speech. Speeches are good, speeches are fun. Uh, we, I mean you, Brett and Miranda, like speeches. May I? I think what Emma's trying to say is that today is a sentimental day for everyone. Even the cake is in tears. [laughing] And that happiness right there, that's all I've ever wanted for my sister. Thank you. [applause] Your love for puns certainly hasn't changed. And you still do those affirmations, I see. I don't know what you're talking about. I think I remember you doing them right as I dropped you off. Something like, you can be single and still be happy. Well, both of those things are true. That was quite the joint speech. Yeah. Clearly you guys can work well together. In tandem. Too soon for failed blind date jokes? It's been a year. You guys have moved past it, right? Don't worry about me, I forgave Emma's bike riding skills a long time ago. Very funny. As long as I'm not the girl waiting for Liam to arrive on time, I'm good. Found ya! And Liam, don't think I forgot about you. - Yay! - Thank you. Be right back! - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. What shade of pink? Definitely the second. It's understated and elegant, just like you. You have the best instincts. [sighs] Speaking of which, I need your help with something tomorrow. Pick out the wedding dress? Don't worry, I already have some thoughts. Mom sent her ideas too. Let me guess, poofy sleeves? If it reminded her of her wedding, she sent it. On that note, I should probably get back to work. It is crazy right now. Everything ok? Yeah, Brett and I are in charge of overseeing the restructuring for one of our biggest clients out West. Miranda, that's huge. Out on your own for less than a year and look how far you guys have come. Running your own consulting company is great but this new job has been a lesson in patience. Is there anything I can do to help? Find my wedding dress tomorrow. I can't wait. - Love you. - Love you too. Queen of corporate events. ♪ ♪ You find anything yet? She hasn't, but I sure have. This reminds me, I do want to go look at the lace options. Just keep it to a minimum, Mom. Kind of feel like the dress will find me. I wish I could wear tennis shoes. Of course you do. Ok, ok. I should probably start searching a little more seriously. So, I got offered a promotion at work. What? Way to bury the lead. Why are we not celebrating? Because I haven't taken it yet and I don't want to tell Mom until I do. I'd have to move to Seattle. Seattle? Wow, you better believe that I will be visiting. You know, I watch that show with the fish throwing guys on TV, it's crazy. You know what's crazy? The fact that we are wedding dress shopping and you haven't tried on a single one. Meet me in the dressing room. Mom, her wedding is gonna be beautiful. [gasps] It's beautiful. Wait, the finishing touch. The one I wore when I married your dad. I wish he was here to see this. He's here in spirit. We understand. We'll be there as soon as possible. What's going on, Brett? Is everything ok? Not exactly. Our west coast guys just called, the onsite consultant quit. What? He just up and left? Yeah. Apparently the reconstructing was too much for him to handle. We have to get over there now, we cannot afford to lose this deal. I know, but the job is slated to take weeks. Weeks, how many weeks? Well, technically we had until... Three days before the wedding. Three days?! That's why we sent him in our place to begin with. We knew we'd have to handle wedding details here so we planned to do everything virtually. Well, can't you send someone else? No. Not now. Our reputations are on the line. You know, it's, it's fine. I'll just hire a wedding planner. Emma, you said you could refer someone? There's no time for that. Unless... No. No way! No, it'll be perfect. You won't even have to be a wedding planner, more like a wedding... stand-in. I already have all the meetings set up with the florist and the band, you just have to stand in for me. A wedding stand-in? Miranda, corporate events are very different... Listen. I know you think you're not cut out for this, but I believe in you. Please, Emma. I promise it'll be fun and if you say yes, I'll never make you wear a cousin Becky sash again. Ok, I'll do it. Yes, you are the best sister. But, I am not a wedding planner, so fair warning... No, wedding stand -in. Very different. But, who's standing in for me? Hm. Good question. Cousin Al? Please, no. Too much time with that cologne might just be the death of me. No. I got someone really different in mind. You want me to be a what? A wedding stand-in. - Is that a thing? - It is now. But what does it entail? That's what I'm still trying to figure out. It's simple. I already have all the meetings set up with the vendors. Meetings we were going to attend, but now can't. So you guys will go. - As you? - For us. You aren't pretending to be us, you're representing us. And making all the decisions. But how do we know what decisions to make? You both know us so well, we trust you to choose for us. - Miranda, are you sure? - Absolutely. That way we can focus all our attention on the restructuring. With two of us there, things will go much faster. Plus, Brett and I talked about it and we thought it would be fun to have everything about the wedding be a surprise. You don't even want me to run our decisions by you? Nope. Because at the end of the day, you could throw a million wedding details at us but... Both: It's the date that matters. See, you guys get it. And I promise we will be back in time for the wedding. [nervous laugh] Well, that's a relief. We can't be standing in for you on the altar. You guys think you're up for this? I'm in. I promise it will be the wedding of your dreams. A stand-in? Yeah. Apparently I have flowers to arrange and cakes to taste. How're we doing today? Three more requests for electronic shifts. What's next? Bikes that ride themselves? Let's hope not. If I fix a few more vintage ones maybe people will want to go back to the good ol' days. You know, when we shifted our own gears. [door chimes] Got time for one more? Ed? For you? Always. And, is that, is that a Riley Ranger? You bet it is. They don't make these anymore. If I refurbish this you could sell it for a pretty penny. You think so? In the vintage bike world, this is as good as gold. I had a feeling it was a lucky bike. What do I owe ya? Come on, Ed, you know I can't charge ya. I figured you might say that so I brought the one payment I knew you would accept. Fresh out of the oven. You're too good to me. I'll have her ready in the next few weeks. Take your time. If you need me, you know where you can find me. Thanks, Ed. Don't even think about it. No, I said flip-flops. Like the shoe. It's a wedding favor, because heels can't be worn forever, sir... Hi, sorry I'm late. Planning the whole wedding now. Kind of. Actually, standing in. Long story, never mind. Well, if you can monogram a wine glass you can monogram a shoe. Hm. Breathe. [exhales] That felt good. I know. So you're planning your sister's wedding now? Yes, and no. It's complicated. But I promise it will not affect work. No, this is perfect. In fact, I think this is exactly what you need. It is? Mmhm. Seattle's a big decision. So, take some time. Focus on the wedding and when it's over, we will talk promotion. Then you'll know how you feel. Thank you, Danielle. I can't tell you how refreshing it is to hear you say that. Oh, my gosh, I just remembered. Drinks. What do people drink at weddings? Uh, I think the same things they drink at other parties. - Right. - Yeah. Right. You're gonna be great. You got this. - I got this. - Yeah. ♪ Liam Barlow, reporting for duty. Congratulations. - You are one minute early. - Yes! So, are you ok that I'm here? I'm fine. Are you ok that I'm here? For sure. Both: Great. So, do you know anything about flowers? Nothing at all. But I'm a fast learner. Well, at least that counts for something. - Hi, guys. - Hey. I'm Natalie, welcome, and congratulations on your engagement. What? Oh, no, we're not engaged. Oh, I thought this was a wedding appointment. It is. - But not our wedding. - We're sort of standing in. For the bride and groom. They're getting married, not us. Right. What he said. Well, the bride and groom must really trust you. Shall we get started? [small laugh] These roses are lovely. - It's the flower of love, right? - Mm-hm. Too predictable. Peonies weren't? Classic and predictable are two very different things. All right, well what about sunflowers? Sunflowers could work. Hm. Now, these I like. You've got quite the eye. I love hydrangeas for weddings. It's a pass for me. Hydrangeas and air conditioning are not friends. At this rate we're gonna be here all night. Both: These. They're different. Bold, yet down to earth. Like Miranda. And a symbol of new beginnings. So? Do we have a flower? We have a flower. We have a flower. I think Miranda's really gonna love these. Wait, Liam! If you ever need anything for the wedding or something else, don't hesitate to call. I do still have some burning questions about ranunculus's, so I'll definitely call you. Do you even know what a ranunculus is? Round and red. [laughs] [phone ringing] - Oh, it's Miranda. - Oh. - Hey! - Hey. How's my favorite duo? You pick us out a flower? Yep, somehow we both agreed the second we saw it. See, I told you working together wouldn't be so bad. And don't tell me anything, I want everything to be a surprise. [car honking] Oh, shoot. Cab is here. I gotta go. I'll call you when we land. Good luck! We couldn't do this without you. Literally. - Happy to help! - Love you! So, uh, do you need a ride? Uh, my car is just around the corner. I think I'll be fine. - Get home safe. - You too. And hey, since we can agree on flowers, we can now agree on anything. Emma: Oh, come on, please work. Maybe a little less bows? But I want something the wedding guests will remember. But honey, the guests also have to be able to sit. I am not cut out for this. Pragmatism over personal touch. That's why I do corporate events. Not ribbons. [chuckles] - Try something like this. - Your wedding album? I brought it over to show you. Maybe you'll find some inspiration. Here. Oh Mom... It's perfect. Your hair was so curly back then. And a little less grey, I may add. And Dad was so handsome. [sighs] He took my breath away, the moment I laid eyes on him. He used to say the same about you. That photo album, you used to love going through it when you were little. I did? Couldn't put it down. And you definitely did not hold back your thoughts. According to you, my bouquet was boring. You said I should have carried a Christmas tree. I still stand by that. Ever since then, I thought you would make a good wedding planner. Why didn't you ever say so? I think it's important to figure those things out for yourself. You never want someone else to define your dreams for you. What if you're still trying to figure out your dream? You can only know if you give something a try. Take a risk. Kind of like these cookies. You go for a batch, and if it's the right recipe, it will work. Hand me the cinnamon. Now, I have never used cinnamon in this recipe before, might be risky, but you'll only know if it works if we try. - Mm. - Mm! See? Definitely worth the risk. - It's really good. - Mhmm. [bell chimes] Liam: I need a few more days with the gears while I wait for parts to arrive. Then she's all yours. Hey! Sorry, I thought I'd take a look around. I hope you don't mind. No, no, not at all. Emma, this is Ed, my favorite customer. He owns the bakery down the street. Also, my favorite. I pay him to say all that. Oh, do you happen to make wedding cakes, because we have a wedding that could use one. You bet. I can make whatever you would like. Then we will have to keep you in mind for cake testing. Well then I would be honored. But, for now, I need to leave you kids at it. I have some cupcakes that need a tune up. Emma, it's a pleasure meeting you. You too, Ed. See ya. Thanks, Ed. I bet you never thought you'd see that tandem bike again? You know, I think my mistake was letting you ride in front. I definitely should have taken the lead. I don't disagree. Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure what to expect, but your shop is pretty cool. I'd like to think of it as much more than just a bike shop. What are all of those, and why are they hiding in the corner? Vintage bikes I'm working on restoring. It's a bit of a passion project for me. I bet they sell like crazy. You'd be surprised. It's hard for someone to walk in here and want a souped-up Riley Ranger when they can roll out with an electric bike. I'm not certain what a Riley Ranger is, but it sounds neat. It's actually really neat. It was crowned the first safety bike. Picture it, the first cruiser of its kind. Well, it looks like you have your work cut out for you. They may look rusty, but giving 'em a second chance and they can surprise you. Anyways, enough bike nerd talk. We have a music date with the Wishing Bells. We do. Let me just get this dirty apron off and let's go. Risky, hard to pull off, but worth it. Risky? Try overwhelmingly cheesy, and if even one person is off beat... But everyone loves a flash mob. [robot noises] Earth to Liam, no flash mobs allowed. Even if I let you finish these fries? Tempting, but no. Ok. Then there better be a lot of dancing. There will be, as long as we find a great band. I'm still deciding if I like this one or not. Well, personally, I think if we want to find the perfect band we gotta dance to them first. Yeah, you have fun with that. No, seriously, I'm really not a good dancer. I find that hard to believe. I promise, no flash mobs. ♪ Oh, I'm sorry. I told you I'm really not good at this. You really don't give yourself enough credit. Let me let you in on a little secret. It's not all about the hips, it's actually your knees. Who taught you how to dance? My grandma. She also gave me my first bike. [laughs] She sounds like a special lady. She was. And she also taught me this. [laughing] Well, you two sure impressed us. Helps when you have a great partner. Sounds like you got yourself a good one... like me. Oh, no we're not... And, if you want to keep her, never stop dancing and never give up. Thank you. Really makes you want to find someone to grow old together. So, what do we think? Still too big in my shoulders? Are you bringing a date to the wedding? A date? I thought you were my date. I'm serious. I think it could be really good for you. We could even set you up on a dating website. A dating app? How am I supposed to do that when I can barely figure out the camera on my phone? Ah, count me out. I'm not saying you have to get married or anything, but don't you think it would be nice to have someone in your life? Don't Miranda and I tell you the same thing? I don't want you worried about me. I'll find someone when the timing is right. In the meantime, I want to spend some time with my best friend. Who's that? Do I know her? Does she have someone she could introduce you to? I'm looking at her. Just promise me, if you meet the right person, you'll give him a chance? Dad would have wanted you to. I promise. Now, do you think she'll like it? I think she'll love it. ♪ Isn't this absolutely beautiful? I love the lace. Look this is gorgeous. Maybe for you. Oh, you're so bad. [laughs] Did you know a wedding table setting has at least 21 components? Plates, silverware, glasses and napkins. Four on my count. And place cards, favors, stationary... Sweetheart, the whole point to you holding the basket is so I can place things in the basket. Sorry. My mind is kind of all over the place. I thought the venue takes care of all that. Why don't you leave it to them? I'm trying to do something meaningful, Mom. Something Miranda will remember forever. Let's see. - Oh. - Oh, excuse me. Um. Oh, by all means. I'm sure there's more. Oh no, uh, it seems to be the last one, so if you... Ed? Emma. What a surprise. You two know each other? Do you two know each other? [laughs] Ed, this is my mom, Mel. And Mom, this is Ed. One of Liam's customers. We just met the other day. Ah. Doing some shopping? Doing the shopping for the week. It turns out your mother and I have the same taste in honey. Ed, please, take, take the last one. Too late, turns out I remember I have some back in the, in the house, yeah. So I have to run. Emma, it's nice to see you and Mel, I hope to see you sometime soon. - Bye, Ed. - Bye. Well, that was very nice. Oh, he was just being neighborly. Mom, he runs his own bakery. I don't think he just casually gives away his ingredients. Now, don't make me feel bad. We should go drop it off to him. No. I'm not trying to make you feel bad, Mom. I'm saying, you've still got it. - She's still got it, folks! - What! Shh. Keep your voice down! [whispers] She's still got it. Shh. You're so bad. [door bells chimes] He wanted a portable charger? For his bike? Apparently, he likes to read his texts and listen to his podcasts. - While he rides? - Yeah. You shouldn't be looking down at your phone when you can be enjoying the road. But, if he does, we have a charger for that. Just got a shipment in yesterday. Happy texting and biking! Make sure you don't forget to look up. Can you believe that? Pretty soon people won't leave their house to bike. I think that's already a thing. Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong century. Right? Send me back to 1920s Paris. I'd make a great tormented writer. I'm serious. What's the point of restoring a vintage bike if it's just gonna sit there and collect dust? You just need to find the right person to see their worth. [door chimes] Oh, hey. I'm early, I know. But, I think I solved the table setting. Ooh, fancy. I just found these at the farmer's market and they're over 50 years old. How perfect are they? And, I got them for pennies. Apparently old linens aren't exactly flying off the shelves. But Brett and Miranda will love them. Yep. Just took the right person to see their worth. So, are you hungry? I haven't eaten all day. Great, because I brought score cards. Perfect. Hold down the fort? Like always. Three, two, one. Six? I use this place all the time for my corporate events. That's how we were able to get a private tasting. Well, I think they could have used more bacon. Thank you. So, what's a corporate event? Is that like a CEO's wedding? I wish. No, it's usually business retreats, big meetings, fundraisers. That type of thing. That actually sounds kind of exciting. If I'm being totally honest, the job isn't exactly what I imagined it would be. It's way more about logistics than it is about turning visions into reality. Well, if it's not what you hoped it would be, why don't you branch out on your own and actually do the events that you dreamed of? You clearly have a talent for weddings. Plus, I actually just got offered a promotion at work. That's awesome. What's not so awesome, I'd have to move to Seattle. Sometimes change can be good. And, for what it's worth, I think that if you ventured out on your own, you'd be really good at it. You need some help over there? I'm sorry, it's just, you're always going on about how things should be meaningful. And this place, just doesn't seem like you. I guess it doesn't seem like Brett and Miranda either. What other options do you have? I don't. And I don't have any time to find another caterer. That's why you have me. You're not doing this on your own, remember? I'm thinking we should get out of this place. I'm right behind you. ♪ - Mm. - Mm. Now that's what I'm talking about. I wonder if Brett and Miranda would want burgers and fries for their wedding meal? I'd take this over those lobster tails any day. We can't actually serve fast food at their wedding. I don't know what we're gonna do. We'll figure it out, I promise. Let's start with a brainstorm. What is this? These are just some wedding planning notes. No, this. - That? - Mm-hm. Just something I was sketching while I was daydreaming the other day. And is that a... a frog? No. It's a bicycle. That's supposed to be a bicycle? Hey, I fix bikes, not draw them, cut me some slack, ok. I would, it's just, are there even handle bars? Fair enough. All right, I'm no Van Gogh. But thankfully I don't need a logo just yet, because my vintage bikes aren't exactly flying off the shelf. One day, hopefully. Well, for what it's worth, Bowentown Bicycles has a nice to ring to it. I think so, too. And your passion for this is really inspiring. It's the only thing I've ever been really passionate about. And it was instant. Ever since that first bike with training wheels. The one your grandmother gave you? Yep. She taught me how to ride without training wheels too. I'll never forget the day she took them off. She reminded me to just keep peddling, gave me a big hug and sent me down that neighborhood hill. Sure enough, I just kept peddling and haven't stopped since. Somehow my first bike ride ended up with me falling in a puddle and seeing my dad laugh like I had never seen before. Oh no. Well, good or bad, it's one of those days that everyone remembers. Or, the first time they rode a tandem bike. Almost ended up with us in a puddle too. Find a good caterer. Find a good caterer. I will find.. ugh! Mom, can you pass me the other stacks of menus, please? Don't you think you should take a break? I can't. I have to find at least one option for tomorrow if I want a tasting. Caterers need plenty of time to prepare and we're already pushing it. I think you're pushing your sanity too. Wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm not... You'll get them back when you relax a bit. What is with everyone and relaxing. Now, do you remember our favorite thing to do when you'd get overwhelmed when you were little? No. Not gonna happen. [laughing] Hold the bowl steady, Mom! The batter's going everywhere. [laughing] Ok, lift a little higher and to the left and pour! I forgot how hard this is. Perfect. [laughing] See? It doesn't hurt to take a break. [phone chimes] Oh. It's Liam. He said he found the perfect caterer. See? I told you it would work out. And now you have time to help me finish what we started. Ooh, sorry. He wants me to meet him there, like, right away. Ah, very convenient. Bye. ♪ ♪ Pretty incredible, right? It's stunning. Bowentown's best-kept secret. I've lived here my whole life and I never even knew this place existed. Only question is... There's a restaurant. Don't worry. Apparently, it's amazing. Natalie recommended it and since she knows the owners we have a great table. Natalie the florist? Yeah. I figured since she helps with so many weddings, she could help recommend a few options. I didn't know you were still in contact with her. Either way, I'm impressed. What? Here. Let me? Flower petal. Great. Thanks. Ok. Nope, restaurant is... This way. - Yep. - Yep. ♪ I can't believe I'm saying this, Liam, but you could be right about this place. Wow. Let me take a moment here to enjoy this. Emma Hall thinks I'm right. Could be. ♪ So, are you bringing anyone to the wedding? No, I don't think so. Why not? Weddings come with a lot of pressure. I think a wedding date should be someone special. Until I meet that someone, I'm flying solo. You? I'm flying solo too. I haven't really been in the dating market as of late. No time. Plus, I want all my focus to be on Miranda that day. So, what's the verdict? Three, two, one. [laughing] I think it's safe to say we're finally in sync. Or in tandem. Hey, do you maybe want to take a walk around? - Yes. - And check out the property. I mean, sure. A walk sounds nice. Actually, I have a better idea. They keep these on the property for anyone to go explore. Although these babies have definitely seen better days. Which is too bad, because this place would be perfect for bike riding. Seems like they could use some of your refurbished bikes. Maybe you should sell them some? You know, I've never thought of that before. Something to consider. Clearly, they love the vintage bike look but could use some that have been fixed up. - Shall we? - Mm-hm. [bike dings off key] [bike dings correctly] You do that on purpose? I have no idea what you're talking about? [laughs] Man, this place looks like it's out of a fairy story. You mean fairy tale? Story, tale, they both work. Except that a fairy tale is an actual word. You see, that's the corporate events world in you talking. You have to leave room for spontaneity. Only if you leave room for a dictionary. [laughs] I have to bring Miranda back here. She would love this. If Miranda loves it, Brett will too. They do see eye to eye on everything. Pretty perfect for each other. Did you know that after their first date, Brett called me and said "I have met my wife." No. I had no idea. Yep. Said he had met the woman of his dreams. Hasn't looked back since. I think Miranda knew pretty early on too. They have that connection, you know, that spark. That's what I want. That's nice that you know what you want. You don't? You seem like the person that has the next ten years of their lives mapped out. - You'd be surprised. - Surprise me. When it comes to relationships, for so long I knew my dream man down to the tie he wore. And I found him, or I thought I did. You can feel like you have all the pieces and still find yourself picking them up when things end. Doesn't mean you shouldn't stop looking. No. It doesn't. - Race you back? - Bring it on. [phone rings] Hi, how's it going over there? It is going great. Had a huge meeting today, Miranda crushed it. Only because somebody gave me the best notes. Oh, wow, you guys! That's awesome. Wow, what's gotten into you? Someone's happy today. I just had a fun day is all. With Liam? Yes, with Liam. But it's nothing. We're just getting along better than I expected. You sure it couldn't be something more? If it was something more, I'd know, right? I mean, you and Brett knew you were going to get married the moment you first met. Uh, Brett knew we were going to get married. I, on the other hand, wasn't sure that I wanted to see him again. What? He planned a picnic under the stars. It was near perfect. That was our first date. But our first meeting was a disaster. I spilled coffee on him and he told me I reminded him of his mother. Wow. I forgot about that. Yep. Can't imagine what life would be like if I hadn't given him a second chance. [doorbell rings] Oh, hang on, sis. That's Liam. Oh, you guys are hanging out? He's just dropping off recs for beverage vendors. Calm down. I'll call you back in five. Bye. There's literally every type of drink vendor here known to man. I threw my five favorite at the top and threw some extra just in case. Wow, Liam, I am impressed. I aim to please. That's it for today, right? Yeah. Ok, I'm gonna go. Wait, actually, since you're here, I could use your help. I was just working on the mood board. Mood board? Mm-hm. Ok. I do this for all my events. I want the board to reflect the mood of the wedding. So, right now I see excitement, hope. New beginnings? Exactly. But, it's missing something. Something like this? - Tennis shoes. - It's the vibe we need. I guess I can get so wrapped up in these things being picture perfect that I forget they can be fun too. Like today was? Super fun. [laughs] What? Nothing. I just, I guess I never thought I'd see you again after that first date. Let alone have you in my house, helping me with a mood board. Come on, that first date wasn't that bad, was it? No. I guess it wasn't. Turns out going out with your friend's sister can be kind of nerve-racking. You were nervous? I don't think I stopped talking. [laughs] You know, now that I think about it, I don't think I got a word in edgewise. But, in your defense, I wasn't really ready to open up. Isn't it funny how time works? [phone chimes] Oh. That's Miranda. I told her I'd call her back and I didn't. No worries. Um, I should get going anyways. Good night. Ciao. You know, in my day, I actually made my own wedding cake? You also had a year to prepare. I want you to enjoy the day as much as Miranda. Not worry about anything except showing up. I'm just saying that if the cakes don't impress us today, you have options. Oh, no. We are finding the perfect cake today. There is no other option. That's why you're here. I need your tasting expertise. Ok, I'm all yours. Now, let's go see who this baker is with his fancy cakes. I might just have to teach him a thing or two. Right. About that. - Hey. - Hey. Mom, you remember Ed, from the farmer's market? How could I forget? I owe you a jar of honey. I heard you're quite the baker yourself. Maybe share a few tips and we'll call it even. Mel, thanks for joining us. We need your expertise. Thank Emma. She's the one who invited me. So, who's ready for some tasting? ♪ Mm. Getting a head start? [laughs] You know what they say. The early bird gets the cake. Do they say that? Mm. That is really good. Yeah. Oh, man. [laughs] I don't know which one to choose. I loved every single one. I did too, Ed. Except, I'm wondering if the cake needs to be a little more... simple? We're going colorful with the flowers, and big with the band, so maybe the cake could be something classic. Old school, even. Oh, how about a butter cake? We used to sell one at the bakery and it was a hit with the customers. Wait. Mom, didn't you used to make butter cakes when we were little? I did. And you and Miranda couldn't get enough of them. Then Ed, I think that's perfect. Miranda would love a cake that reminds her of growing up and of you, Mom. Well, you can't go wrong with one of those. The thing is, it's been a long time since I've made one. I might need you to show me the ropes on this one, Mel. Oh, I don't know. It takes a while to make. - I'm in no rush. - Me either. I've got all day. ♪ ♪ The moment of truth. Ok. Mm. Mm. So? I think, um... it's the best butter cake I've ever had. [laughing] So, do we have a wedding cake? Is it really a cake tasting if I get to bring the whole thing home? Correction, we brought it home. Which means I get this bite. - You didn't. - Oh, but I did. And now that the cake is finished... Unfairly! We should have shared that last bite. We get to take a chomp out of this. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [phone rings] Seating chart, check. Bridesmaid dresses, check. Invitations, check. And you thought you couldn't do it yourself. You're still considering that promotion? 'Cause I think that Emma Hall, wedding planning sounds pretty good to me. I'm sure it does, but enough about me. How are things going over there? Well, you will be happy to know that everyone is trained, the client feels great about the transition and they said they put out word about our company in town. Awesome. So does that mean you can come back early? Oh, we still have a few loose ends to tie up, but I spoke to Mom and she said you and Liam have everything figured out. And it sounds like I could show up on the day of and be ready to go. Are you joking? Was that a joke, 'cause I'm not laughing. I'm kidding. You can relax. I'm still slated to show up three days before the big day. I'm so excited and so grateful. Miranda, you're my sister. I told you I'd give you the wedding of your dreams and it's going to happen. [phone chimes] Oh! I gotta run. Me too, talk later. The client is going to love my designs. Oh, Emma, what are you doing here? Coming into the office isn't what I meant by taking time off. I know, but I just couldn't help myself. I felt inspired with some new designs. You don't relax much, do you? Oh, two plans. That's right. One is the neutral version. It was quite a feat to tone it down, but I think I managed. And the second one is my last attempt to get them to take a little risk. I know they don't like big, bold colors, so I got creative with the space. I suggested a long dessert table and I thought a dance floor would be fun. I mean, business people like to groove too. You went above and beyond as always, Emma. I'll take these to the client and see what they say. Ok. Oh, and Emma, please take some time to relax and think about the job. No more work. - You got it. - Ok. [chuckles] - Hey. - Hey! How'd it go? The plans aren't approved yet, but my boss is hopeful, so we'll see. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Here. What's this? Just something small I sketched between confirming RSVPs. Small, this is so cool! Well, you mentioned you wanted to get some customers to buy your vintage bikes and a little branding never hurts. Is that a Riley Ranger on the logo? Just a personal touch. And for the record, I'd take a Riley Ranger over an electric bike any day. Emma, I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. All you have to do is help me decide if this is a good place for the altar. We did it, didn't we? We planned an amazing wedding for the people we love. We did. And dare I say, it was fun? It was, wasn't it? You have such a knack for these things. The cake, the linens, you put meaning behind everything. Thank you. You like the altar here? I do. You? I do... too. [phone ringing] Sorry. Oh, it's Natalie. I have to take this, it's important. No problem. Hey, Natalie. Great to hear from you. [sprinkler] That can't be good. Emma: The whole plumbing system? No, no, it's no one's fault. I'm sure we'll figure something out. Thank you. Good news? Sadly, no. So, what does that mean for the wedding? We have to find a new venue. They have to fix the plumbing on the entire house. Resod everything. Could take weeks. And we can't push it back. The date means everything to Brett and Miranda. A new venue a week before the wedding? This can't be happening! I'm dreaming. Am I dreaming? Pinch me. Here pinch me. Hey. It's gonna be ok. [phone buzzes] Miranda. Miranda: Hey, everything going well? Yep. Everything's great on the wedding front. Miranda: Well, it isn't here. Don't get mad, but we had to push our flights. A last-minute fire to put out. Uh-huh. So, when are you coming then? Miranda: The day before the wedding. You aren't coming until... Miranda: I know. But there just isn't anything we can do and you just said everything is fine on your end, so just keep it that way until we get there. Yeah, shouldn't be a problem. Miranda: Thank you. We're the wedding stand-ins. We got this. Hey, is this the MacMillan Centre? Yeah, I'm just calling to see if you have any availability for a wedding next week? That's the thing, it's actually next week. All right. I appreciate your help. Bondel Horticultural Museum. Hi there, I'm calling to see if your museum can host a wedding? Yeah, sure. That's great. It would be for next week on... I'm so sorry, we're booked. Shoot. Ok. Thanks anyway. The arboretum is booked that day. Are you sure the zoo can't fit that many people? What if we removed the elephants? Thank you for trying. Have a nice day. Liam: Feeling lucky I tell you, just around the corner. Twelve times a charm, right? Just up ahead. Lucky 13, then? I don't think that's how it works. You tried the courthouse? Booked through next year. I'm not sure if this phone book helps. I think half these places are out of business. I'd offer my bakery but I don't know if you want people making wedding toasts next to an oven. Bit on the nose? There has to be another option. What about a sushi restaurant? Koi fish can be romantic, right? I guess we're gonna have to get creative. You know, think outside the box? But it can't be just anywhere. It needs to be someplace special. Something... Out of a fairy story. You call the vendors, I'll go to the venue. Got it. Ed, do you mind if I borrow her for something? It's important. By all means, you're the one who got her going, you might as well be the one to take her on her first spin. Thanks, Ed. First, I gotta make a call. Hey, Natalie, do you have a second? Check it out. Yeah, love it. [phone ringing] Hey, Natalie, thanks for everything. [phone ringing] Danielle. Hi. Hi, how are you doing? The wedding's right around the corner. Literally. Uh, it's been a whirlwind to say the least. Danielle: And hopefully insightful. It's giving me a lot to think about. Well good, because that's why I called. I pitched your updated designs. And? And the client loved it. They did? The dance floor and all? The dance floor and all. Danielle, you don't know how happy I am to hear that. Well good. They are going to make some adjustments and they'll get their ideas back to us soon. I also just got off the phone with my partners. They're very excited about you. We all want you to know that you're going to be able to take risks and push yourself and focus on your vision. Really? Danielle: Yeah. You won't just be arranging small business lunches. We're talking conferences and trade shows and executive programs. Product launches. So, color, theme, decorations wise, it's all pretty standard, but what these events lack in personality, they absolutely make up for in diversity. You really will get to experience it all. All except weddings. Definitely not weddings. Well, thanks for the call. We'll talk soon. - Liam! - Ed! How'd it go? You were right. This is one lucky bike. [chuckles] And one lucky cupcake. - Is that for me? - That's for you. She's all yours. Thank you. Honey, I'm sure their flight just got a little delayed. It's nothing to worry about. No one texted me before takeoff and, I mean, why would they? They're just the bride and groom. It's not like they should check in with me or anything. No, that would be crazy. I'm sure they're flying right above us as we speak. They better be. I'm just not sure if I'm going to hug them or hyperventilate when they finally get here. I would hug. But that's just me. I'm sure tomorrow's going to be wonderful, Emma. You and Liam have worked so hard. I just want you to be able to enjoy the wedding too. It's kind of hard when you're worried about the bride and groom getting stuck in a different time zone. Do you want to do some baking? That might help you relax. Italian wedding cookies, in honor of the occasion? Thanks, Mom. But, I actually have to drop off Miranda's dress at her house. Maybe I'll wait for them to get home too since I can't rely on her to call me. Ah, ah, remember. Hug her when she comes through the door. No hyperventilating. I'll do my best. Woah, you're kicking things into high gear, literally. Well, Brett and Miranda land tonight and I promised Emma I'd be in full wedding mode in case she needs me. I think you both have been in wedding mode for the past six weeks now. Fair point. How're you feeling? About the wedding? Good. Honestly? Proud. I think Brett and Miranda are gonna be really moved. Emma, what she's done, she's incredible. [scoffs] - What? - I didn't say anything. She's just... I'm glad it all worked out and we ended up working really well together. Stop doing that. What, I'm not doing anything. Clearly. Pass me the wrench. One last thing here. Finished. Now, we wait for the bride and groom to arrive so the fun can begin. But the real fun is how you get them to leave. That's always my favorite part. Leave. Yeah, are you doing the old car and cans or did you need me to go paint "just married" on the windshield? Oh, yeah. We completely forgot about that part. Oh, that's kind of a big thing to forget. Call Emma, I'm sure she'll have a binder full of ideas. Nope, she has enough on her plate. I got this. ♪ Miranda, where are you? [door opens] Miranda: Hey, we're back. Last wedding detail. Feels so good to be home. Tell me about it. You almost gave me a heart attack.

I am quite sure that whatever you and Liam put together will be everything and more. Truly Emma, I am so grateful. You are the best Maid of Honor and the greatest sister. How did I get so lucky? Ok. Enough pre-wedding emotions. I am not supposed to cry until tomorrow. I am prepared for that as well. You thought of everything. Details are where I thrive. Except, you forgot one detail for yourself. A date to the wedding. I told you I didn't want to bring anyone. I want to be focused on you, not some random date. I can think of one person you could bring who isn't random. What's holding you back? I guess, I just don't know how he feels about me. But do you know how you feel about him? Then tell him.
