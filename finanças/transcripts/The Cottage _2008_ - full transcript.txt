[WIND WHISTLING] * [] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [BIRD CHATTERING] [LOW WIND HOWLING] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [KEY TURNS IN LOCK] [SIGHS] [BIRD CROAKS TWICE] [RATTLES CAN] [CAN CLANKS ON FLOOR] We're going to go to hell for this. Shut up. It's freezing in here. Jump up and down a bit. You know how temperature-sensitive I am, David. In actual driven miles, I think this is the furthest away I've been from Rebecca since we got married. I'm sure she'll survive. Well, I don't feel comfortable lying to her like this. I know you're used to a-- [PIPES CREAKING] I know you're used to a world of deception. Our relationship relies on a bond of trust. Do you want some tea? Yes, please. Can you get the milk from the car? How many sugars? Shows how often you've made me tea. Give it a rest. You're doing my head in. I'm just pointing out facts, David. Just get the milk from the car, please. [HEDGE RUSTLES] [KEYS JINGLE] Christ, what are you doing frightening me? Aren't you forgetting something? Oh, yeah. Well, I'm not used to this, am I? How many times do I have to fucking tell you? She all right? Still unconscious. That's chloroform for you. Well, it's freezing out there, so if I may make a suggestion, I think we should bring her in so she doesn't die of pneumonia. Look, Peter, we've just got here. I am very tired. We are not in Iceland, and she is not going to die of-- What have you put that back on for? Because I'm cold. I don't want to talk to your eyes. Take it off. You're not the boss of me. Where the fuck are you? Please. Get rid of it. What? Oh, shit, yeah. You don't like moths, do you? Get rid of it now, or I'm bloody going. I didn't say kill it. What do you want me to do with it, adopt it? I think I'd like to ring Rebecca now. It's a good time. Because you've seen a moth? No, we like to let each other know we're okay. That's what you do in a serious relationship. No, it's called reporting in. That's what you do when you're under a very fat thumb. I'm not under a thumb. It's not fat, either. The reason why I'm ringing her now is she'll be putting Amy to bed and it'll go to the answering machine. I don't want her asking questions. I don't like lying. Don't be all day. I don't remember putting a time limit on your calls. This is my fucking phone. You always were selfish. Where's your phone? Why? In my car. Because it's my work phone. It's in my work car. Did you forget your phone? Idiot. My work phone. What did you call me? Idiot. You are a bald idiot. Well, I'd rather be slightly thinning than a friendless mockney-phile. I cannot wait till I never have to see your-- Hi, darling, I'm just calling to check in. Everything's okay my end... apart from being really cold. Anyway, I'll try you again later on. Give baby Amy a kiss for me. Love you lots. Yes, I blew her a kiss. So? [WHISPERING] Listen, if she's asleep, I suggest we be as quiet as possible so we keep her that way. Can I hold the legs? Come on. [BIRDS RUSTLING, CHIRPING] [SIGHS] I really don't like it out here, David. Hurry up and get inside, then. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I have to have a rest. Come on, we're only three steps from the top. I'm not as strong as you, David. Okay, go on. Fuck. I'll see if the keys are downstairs. [GRUNTS] Don't drop her. Oh! PETER: Oh! Ohh! Uhh! [CRYING] [MUFFLED] Get your hands off me! Fucking bastard! [SCREAMING] [LOUD AND MUFFLED COMPLAINTS] [SCREAMS] Get off, you fucking pervert! [YELLING] You fucking cunt! [WHIMPERING] You only had to hold her up. What the fuck were you doing?! I think she's broken my nose. Yeah, that is well and truly busted. What the hell am I going to do? It really hurts! You should have been concentrating, then. I bet--I bet you were looking at her tits. I was not! She head-butted me repeatedly! I've never been head-butted by anyone before in my life! Well, you have now. Please help me, I'm in a lot of pain! [TAP SHUTS OFF] Whenever I'm with you, I always end up getting hurt, every time, guaranteed. Don't blame me. I wasn't with you. That's what you said about the greenhouse. That was 20 fucking years ago. Ow! Right. I'm going to knock this back into place. How? I don't want you to. Shut up and hold still. Wait, wait, wait, do it slowly! [CRACK] [DRAWN-OUT SCREAM] [SIREN WAILS] Nice hair, Andrew. Just had it done? WOMAN: Nice hair, Andrew. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUES UPSTAIRS] [DISTANT SHOUTING] Andrew. Dad asked to see me. Nice haircut, Andrew. A lot of work's gone into that. ARNIE: Keep him out there till we get the call. God. Okay, time for work. I need you to stop whining and sort yourself out. - Why? - Because you are going to have to speak to her. To fucking... To who? The woman upstairs. Why? I told you, she knows me. She comes in the club all the time. That's why it has to be you. Oh, yes, okay. What do you want me to say? Well, you have to say a lot of things, but-- but more importantly, you have to sound like someone who is going to kill her if she fucks about. - I'm not going to kill her. - I never said you had to, did I? You just have to sound like someone who would if they had to. Well, what do you want me to say, then? You have to tell her that if you get any more trouble out of her, you're going to break her fucking fingers. I can say that easily. Why are you making a big deal of it? Because you couldn't scare a child in the dark. You have to say it right. You have to-- like you're fucking hard. Okay, let's go. But no, no, no. Say it to me first. Why? Just... do it, come on. Okay, fine. Any more trouble from you, miss, and I'll break your fingers. Right, say it again, harder. Any more trouble from you, miss, and I'll break your fingers. That was rubbish. Well, how should I say it--? Any more trouble from you, you fucking bitch, and I'll break your fucking fingers! Like that. Fine. I now understand. Any more shit from you, and I'll break your bloody fingers! Yeah, that was-- that was better. Yeah, finally. Thank you. Anything else? Yeah, yeah... we have to let her speak to her dad, and then you're going to take the phone off her and tell him we want the money. Yep. A hundred thousand? I thought you might. I remember that bit. Now, this bit's very specific, so I want you to read this bit of paper to her. Okay. No, no, no, no. Read it now, once, so that you know it. Badly written. Got it? Without commenting on it. Of course. Okay, I've read it. Right. Let's make some tea. [CREAKING] [PANTING] You fucking bastards! Get my hands free, and I'll cut and kill you! Listen, if we have to go through this every time I want to speak to you, then David here will have to use his knife to teach you a lesson. So will you be quiet now? I want to pour this into your mouth for you. There's no sugar in this. Oh, uh, sorry. I broke your nose, didn't I? What-- what do you mean? I mean, pussy, that I broke your fucking nose with me hands tied behind me back, so what does that make you apart from a little pussy? You didn't break it. I think I fucking did. [SNAPPING FINGERS] Now, look, you are our hostage. If you don't give us a hard time, you will be fine and looked after. However, if you cross us, I will break your fingers. Now, I'm going to be speaking to your father, so will you please be quiet? Can I speak to Arnie, please? This is you, okay. No, it doesn't matter who I am. Yes, I'm with her-- No, you can speak to her in a second. No, the amount is 100,000! We would like you to put the money in a bag and give it to your son. He is to drive alone to Fleet services on the M3 and wait next to the men's toilets. Make sure you don't send no one else. Terrible double negative. Doesn't make sense. If anything goes wrong or someone is with him, your stepdaughter is a dead girl. You've got two hours. Yeah, you can, yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. From the house. No, they seem like a bunch of fucking morons. One of them's called David. And they're a pair of hopeless cunts-- Right, you bastard, we will hurt her if you don't give us what you want! What we want! Big mistake. No one has ever hit me in the whole of my fucking life. You don't know who my father is, do you? Do you know what he'll do to you and David here when he finds out who you are? Every member of your queer-boy family will be in wheelchairs for the rest of their fucking lives because they'll have no knees left because me dad will cut them out with an axe! Then they'll get you, and then they'll kill you, and they'll kill your family and friends! [ANGRY SHOUT] You're a fucking moron. Why? I said what you wanted me to, didn't I? Ow! Because, moron... ...the reason I got you to talk in the first place was because I didn't want anyone to know it was me who was keeping her hostage! Now, that plan falls to shit if you start using my name! You fucking did. Oh, did I use your name? Sorry. It's hard to concentrate when you're having your life threatened! It was the first fucking thing you said! You're never satisfied, are you? You turn up out of the blue, begging for my help in something completely illegal. You're not doing this out of charity, you self-righteous fuck! I want that house, and I want you out of it! I will take Mum's house, and I will make you fucking eat it! What the hell's going on? David, it's dark. Fucking relax. The meter's run out. I've only just put money in. This is ridiculous. What kind of a place still has a meter? Right. Let's see how long this lasts. [MUSIC PLAYS] [VOICES CHATTER] In you go, Andrew. Seems like some idiots have made the mistake of kidnapping your stepsister. ARNIE: Son... I've got a job for you. [SIGHS] He's leaving now. [KEYPAD BEEPS] Hello. David. Yes. I'm very near. Yes, I've got the bag next to me. [BEEPING] Hang on. Look, David, I think this phone's going to die on me any second. Oh, no. [HONING BLADE] [KNOCKS] [SETS BRAKE] I am fucking rich! I didn't know you had a brother. Nobody does. That's why I used him. Hello. Hello. I brought these to celebrate. Peter, brother dearest, this is it. I earn 50,000 pounds, and Mum's house is all yours. God, you made it work! You bloody did it! We did it. 50,000 pounds. I'll be free. I'll never have to live in East Sheen again. I'll have my own independence. What's it look like? I don't know. I didn't look inside. What? I didn't check it. DAVID: No...! Maybe that fuck face look in the bag. ...no! Um... probably should have checked it. Yes, you fucking should. What does this mean, David? It means that the money isn't in the fucking bag, is it, Andrew? It means that your dad probably has a good fucking idea that you are involved. Sorry. What shall we do? Were you followed? By a car? I don't think so. This changes everything. I still want the house. That's the deal. That happens when I get the money. That's the deal. I knew it, backstabber! The minute you asked me to get involved, I should have handcuffed myself to the house! I said when I get the money you could have my half of the house. I never mentioned a bag of tissues! This Arnie knows. He could have thugs at my house! He doesn't even care, he doesn't even know. He doesn't even know who the fuck you are! The only person he knows is involved is him! PETER: You told me this would be simple. I can't believe I listened to you again, again! Just give me two minutes! It's only just happened. I'll make it work, Peter. I'll believe it when I see it. I'm going outside for a cigarette, and after that I might just bloody well go home! [SIGHS] David? Have you got a bottle opener? You'd better disappear from my presence or I'm likely to hurt you. I'm going to take a look at Tracey. I don't care. Just let me alone. I take it while you were being a fucking idiot you remembered a mask? Yes, I got one on the way here. Great, now get out. David? I've picked up the wrong kind. Get out of my fucking sight now. Sorry. There's some bald fuck outside. Some bald fuck here. You recognise his ass? Never see this mother before. Okay. Tracey is alive. You go and see who in there. Arnie want to know right now. I cut them the fuck up. Go and look in the house! Then you can cut this fool. We don't need his ass no more. [WHIMPERING] You see this cleaver? No, please, no! When I get back, me, you go play big time, baby. Real nice. No, no! What's that? A boat? No, it's a lemon tree. It's mine. I'm getting on it, and I am fucking off away from all of this. Ooh, a hoodlum running away from his underworld pals to get on a boat and lead a simple life. How bloody original. Well, you want me gone, don't you, so you can live happily ever after with that fat pig of a wife of yours? At least I have a wife. Oh, so you agree she's a fat pig? No, I bloody don't! Unlike you, I like the stability of having a partner. A controller, just like Mum. I couldn't help it if Mum loved me more. I know you hate me for that. Couldn't really give a shit who she loved. She still gave me half the house. Charity was always her weak spot. Just stop talking for two seconds, will you? Don't worry, I will. Nothing more to say. I'm smoking too much because of you! * [] Ow. [SING-SONG] I can see you. Peter, I need your bank account number. - Why? - We're going to have to get him to do a bank transfer. Why can't we use your account? I don't have one, do I? I only use cash. I don't have one either. Why don't you have one? Me and Rebecca share a joint account. You've got a bank card. What's the number on it? I don't know the number. Rebecca looks after the card. God, I should've known. Andrew, tell me, have you got a bank account? - Yes. - Fantastic. What's the number? I don't know. What are we going to do if we don't have an account? I've got an account we can use. Oh, great. Whose? Mum's. What?! That is supposed to be shut down! Well, I didn't get round to it. A good job, too. You fucker, you're dragging Mum into criminal activity. I won't allow it! It's a simple as that! It's either that or no money and no house. You're blackmailing me and dirtying Mum. What if they trace the details back to Mum's account? Well, it doesn't matter, does it, 'cause she's dead. You bastard, David! Peter, I didn't mean to say that... really. Look, if we don't get the money, then all this will have been for nothing. That boat is my dream, and Mum's house is yours. We're both risking a lot here. And I am. You are a pain in the ass who fucks up everything he touches. Okay, David, but then I want that account closed. It will be. I haven't got the account number. It's at home. Have you? I'll have to wake Rebecca. She won't like that. Thank you. Oh... Hello. Hiya. PETER: Was she asleep? Sorry. Are you stressed? Yeah, sorry. I know, sorry. This is going to sound like a strange request. I need you to get the Mum folder. I just... I need the details so I can close it down. No, don't say that. He just-- he just forgot, that's all. No, I'm not. I'm not sticking up for him. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I know. Sorry. Can I-- can I have it, though, please? Thank you. You fucking cunts! Get me out of this fucking smelly fucking room now! You fucking bastards! [ANGUISHED PANTING] Take me out of this room, you slags! I've had nothing to eat! I am not a fucking animal! Andrew. I knew it was you, you smelly fuck. You are fucking dead! David, I've dropped the phone in some water downstairs! I've seen your face, dead cunt. You're dead, you're all dead! Ugly, David, and fat fucking Andrew! [DOOR SLAMS] [PANTING] I must be the biggest idiot out of all of us, for getting involved with you and for getting you involved. What are we going to do? Let me see the phone. It's broken. I can fucking see that! I'm sorry, it was the pond. How's your phone? It's run out of battery. Okay, have you got a charger? Great. Where is it? Yes. In the club. What the fuck is it doing there?! It's plugged in the wall. It was a rhetorical question! I'm going to have to go up to that village, use a payphone. Won't he recognise your voice? She knows now, doesn't she, so none of that means anything anymore. I'm not the only one that makes mistakes. You think you're perfect! Shut up, Peter! For once in your life, shut up! And take some fucking responsibility! I take it that that is right? [SOBS] Mm-hmm. [DOOR SLAMS] Fucking hell! [DOOR OPENS] [KEYS RATTLE] You blocked me in, you cunt! [CAR STARTS] What the fuck? Yah! What are you doing? What the fuck you doing? [PHONE RINGING] Hello, you mother, Arnie. How many? Andrew, that guy David, and some bald mother. What do you want us to do? Okay, I send you details now. Muk Li, get rid of this fuck. What did you say? Arnie coming now, and he very pissed man. Okay, dumb fuck, we go now. No, no, please! Please, no! No! Please! [SIGHS] Arnie. Yes, it's me. Ye--yeah, thanks for that. You never know when you'll need a tissue. I'll check the account in the morning, and I'll call you back. What? Fuck. What the fuck are you all staring at? Stranger, eh? I've seen a few flash cars driving through here tonight. You're up at the Barnaby cottage, in't ya? What the fuck's it got to do with you? You make sure you lock your doors. Strangers don't fare well in these parts. [CHUCKLES] What? [DOG BARKS] Thorn! Thorn. [LOW, SUSTAINED GROWL] You just don't go wandering. That's my advice to you, my lad. Thanks, great. [CAR STARTS] [PRISONER CRYING] [MUK LI YELLS] [WIND WHISTLING] [PRISONER SCREAMS] [ANIMAL SQUAWKS] Muk Li. You finished? [HOOTS SOFTLY] What the fuck? [SCREAM] [CAR ALARM BLARING] Shit! Peter! Peter! [EXCLAIMS] Wake up, you fat fuck. Where's that bitch and my brother? [GROANING] I've been gone for less than an hour. What the fuck's been going on? Stop squeezing, I can't think. You're not capable of thinking. You're a fucking idiot. What happened? Ow. Okay, wait. That's the whole point. Where's Peter? He and your sister have gone missing. She was hitting me. I'm going to hit you in a minute. Wait. I remember. We were sat at the table when she started to bang on the ceiling, so we both went upstairs to see what she wanted. She wanted to use the toilet. I said it was a bad idea, but he said we should allow it. I told him we couldn't trust her, so we went in with her. After she'd done a urine, she said she wanted to wipe herself, and unless we wanted to do it for her, we'd have to untie her. Well, I didn't fancy it, and I don't think your brother did either. So we untied her. But that's when he started to freak out. I don't know why. There was something in the room. ANDREW: Yeah. DAVID: Was it a moth? Well, while we were distracted, she lunged at me and I fell out with the door. It hurt. She was furious. She grabbed Peter. And then she came over and hit me. He's on his own with her. He better be all right for your fucking sake. I ca-- what else can go wrong? [GROANING] [DOOR SLAMS OPEN] Help me! What the fuck? [BODY THUDS] [SCREAMS] Steven? [CHOKING] Do you know him? Yes, I saw him this morning. He cuts my hair. What the fuck's he doing here? Wait. [PANICKED PANTING] You didn't tell him about this, did you? No. Oh, yes. No, I did. You really are fucking unbelievable. Who brought you here? Chinese... Korean? Oh, no. Muk Li and Chun Yo. Fuck. Where are they? Did you see a bald bloke? No. Don't go out there. You'll... die. [GASPS] [TRICKLING] [GAGS] Oh, my God. They've cut him open. Is he dead? What do you think? Well, if they can do that to him, they can do that to us. Okay. Oof! That's for everything you've ever done. All right, you got here an hour and a half ago, which means that, as Arnie probably knows where we are, he's less than an hour away. Okay, get your ass in gear. We're going to find my brother, grab your sister, then we're fucking off back to the city. Where's my knife? [GARBLED] My face! You've broken my jaw, I know it. Shut your fucking mouth and keep walking. I've got a family. What are you going to do to me? I can't understand what you're saying. Why did you bring me? Because I couldn't move me fat cunt of a stepbrother, and when I finally see me father he is going to want to talk to someone, and that will be you. Ow! Why are we walking in the woods? I hate woods. There could be wolves out here. Have you thought about that? It's so cold. I'm really temperature-sensitive. What? Tem-pera-ture sen-si-tive. You had better hope that we find a phone soon, or I am going to stick this knife in your balls. Now, keep close to me, and get a fucking move on. That's my brother's knife. [OWL SCREECHES] 'Keep off land!' Obviously some thick cunt lives here. I can't climb up with this. Stop staring at it and get the fuck over it! We shouldn't even be here. It says, 'Keep off land'. There's a dead animal. We're going into the woods. * [] [KNOCKING] Is anyone there? What? Is anyone in the house? Hello? Right, fuckhead, if you whinge, cry, or do anything to let the owners of this house know that I'm going to kill you, I'll kill you. Got it? This wasn't even my plan-- A nod of the fucking head'll do. Hello? [MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY] [BEETHOVEN'S NINTH SYMPHONY PLAYING] Fucking rubbish! What the fuck are all these? This isn't normal. Where you going? I'm going upstairs to see if there's a phone. Well, I might run away. You might run away? [EXCLAIMS] [SOBS] God, I can't take this anymore! [JAW CLICKS] Oh, I can talk. I can talk again! Aah! Fucking run now, you cunt. Definitely won't be able to go home again. I should have checked that bag for the money. Damn it, I would have seen those tissues... Andrew, shut up a minute. What? Do you know what Muk Li San looks like? Yes. Shit. Yes, that's him. What's happened? He's had his throat cut. Maybe it was Chun Yo Fu. They're always arguing. You don't get your throat slit over an argument. Something's not right. [CREAKING] [PANTING] [CREAKS] [GRUNTS] Oh, my God! [SCREAMING] * [] [PETER SCREAMING] Ow! Oh... [WHIMPERS] [GROANS] [WATER DRIPPING] [RUMBLING] [CHAINS DRAGGING] [SNIFFING] [GAGS] [CHOKES SOB] [THUMP] Help! Come down! Quick, come down! Fucking idiot. What the fuck is the matter with you? Why are there peas all over the floor? I heard something underneath that trapdoor. What? There, there, underneath. [CHAIN SCRAPES] See? There, there it is. No, no, don't open it, don't open it! We'll be killed! We're in a creepy house in the middle of nowhere. There's a trapdoor in the kitchen with a weird noise coming from underneath. What the fuck do you think is going to be down there? [SIGHS] See, nothing. It was probably a fucking rat, which is why only you heard it. Now stop causing a fucking problem, or I'll tear... What? What? Why are there hands in the freezer? I think we should go now. Yeah. [BLADE SLASHES] Uhh! Aah! [ROARS] [SCREAMS] Gah! No! Oh... Oh, aah! [THUMPING] [YELLING] [STRAINING] [MAN GRUNTS] [PANTING] [BLADE RINGS] [MAN ROARS] [THUMPING RESUMES] [EXCLAIMS] [SCREAMS] [GASPING] [GRUNTS] Aah! [GROWLS] [CONTINUES GROWLING] Uh! Wait! Don't you leave me. Don't you fucking leave me. [SNORTS] Peter, I'm sorry. And I won't tell me dad. I promise you'll be okay. Why should I believe you? Because I'm begging you. Please, I don't want to die. Oh, what am I doing? All you've done is hurt me or be rude to me. I must be an idiot. Just hurry up and get me out of here. He's right bloody there. Hurry up! Get a move on! You fucking bastard! Get back here now! Get back here, you fucking pussy! Coward! Chickenshit! What are you looking at, you ugly fuck? Uhh! Ow! Please don't say anything. [CLATTERS] [WHIMPERS] This is the worst night in my life. Not only have I met you, I've stumbled into the only house in the country with someone worse than you. Shut up, for fuck's sake! I saved you. Well, that's your fault, pussy. Please, Peter, please. I need you. Mug! I knew it. I'm so gullible. I should have left you. I'd be miles away by now. What do you want me to do with this? We've got to kill him. No, I will not. Yes, you fucking will. When he wakes up, he's not going to be very happy. We've got to kill him now, before he comes round. I can't, I don't know what to do. Just stick it in him, you fucking weed! [GASPS IN PAIN] Where? In his head. Today! Oh, give me the fucking thing. If you're too much of a wet shit, I'll do it meself. Stop calling me names. I'm not like you. I know that, little boy! I'm not a little boy. I'm probably twice your age. Just because I can't murder or kill-- [SHRIEKING] [SCREAMING] [MAN GRUNTS] Go on! Fucking do it, you ugly prick! Cut the cunt's head off! Come on! Fucking do it! What are you waiting for? You're a fucking man, aren't you? Or are you just a fucking woman like all the fucking others? Come on, I haven't got all day to wait for some ugly prick to kill some scraggy cunt. [HOWLING] [GAGGING] [PETER CONTINUES HOWLING] [SHRIEKING] [FOOTSTEPS] [FLESH SQUELCHES] [ANDREW GRUNTS] They've been over this fence. How do you know that? Because that whale and baby are his family. Let's go. [PANTS] Can't we stop a moment? I'm really tired. No, we can't. I'm not used to walking. I don't care. Should we be on the lookout for traps? Why? Because we're near a farm. Don't they always use tra--? Aah! Aah! Aah! Shut up! David! Okay. Aah! [THUD] [WOLF HOWLS] Who do you think lives here? Old MacDonald. Who's that? Shut up. Keep your eyes peeled and be careful. Do you think we should look inside, see if they're in the house? Yeah. What the fuck? What is that? If I'm not mistaken, it's a piece of my brother's shoe. [SQUELCHING SOUND] And foot. Oh, fuck me! What? They've cut off his feet. Who's doing this? Have they got Tracey? Right, fuck the plan! Fuck the money! I need to find my brother. [HINGES CREAK] What was that? That door over there. Don't be long. [WHISPERS] Peter? Peter? 'The children have found 'a young man tied up in the barn. 'He had no face. 'I think he's going to hurt us. 'We will try to flee tonight. Must stop. He is coming.' What the hell is this place? [WINCES] Tracey? Tracey? David. Dav--ow! David. David, somebody's cut off Tracey's head. I know, I'm looking at it. Should we get out of here now? I'm not leaving without Peter. I've found a coat. I think there's a light in here. Jesus, mother of fuck! Well, Peter's not here, so he may still be alive. That one moved. DAVID: Which one? The ugly one. [BOTH SCREAM] [GROWLS] [STRUGGLES] What the fuck are you? [YELLS] Aah! [CRIES OUT] Aah! [GROANING] [PETER CONTINUES SCREAMING] DAVID: Oh, God! David! Aah!

Tracey's dead, and there's a madman after me. Aah! [SCREAMING] [GASPS] [ANDREW CONTINUES SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] Peter? David! What the hell's going on? Where are you? There's a farmer. He's a lunatic. He's killed Tracey. I'm hanging on a hook. I'm in so much pain. DAVID: Wait. I'm trying to get free. [HISSES] [GROANS] Peter, can you move? I can't. I'm stuck, pinned to the ground. I need your help. Okay, wait there. Okay. I'll wait here. [PETER SCREAMING] [STRAINING] Gah! Fuck! Aah! Uhh! Ow! Okay, David, I'm coming. Don't worry, I'm coming. [STRUGGLING] Gah! Oh, God. Oh, this is taking ages. Guh. Gah! Oh, hurry up, for fuck's sake. I'm here. I know. You okay? No, I'm in a lot of pain. This is probably going to hurt. [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] [SOBBING] Oh! [STICK CLATTERS] Uhh. I've only got half a foot. I know. I found the other half of it over there. What did you do with it? I lost it. Oh, not to worry. What a clear night. You can actually see the stars. Wow, they're amazing. Peter, I'm sorry. Oh, forget about it. I don't think even you could have foreseen this. What's this? It's the deed to Mum's house. Oh, well... I'm sure we'll both be dead within the hour. Let's... share for the rest of our lives. [CHUCKLING] Sounds like a plan. Mum would've-- she'd have liked that. Yeah. Yes, she would've done. [BLADE SCRAPES] [GRUNTING SOFTLY] [HOWLS] Fuck this. I want my boat. I want to sail on it and live the rest of my life. We are not dying here tonight. [GASPS] Okay. [PANTING] [GROANING] Gah! Have you looked for a phone yet? No, not properly. I was being chased by a madman. I'm going to look for one. Shouldn't we just get away? It's taken us ten minutes to get in here. There isn't another house for miles around. Best thing we can do is get help to come here. Just wait here. What shall I do? If the farmer comes back, just give me a shout. Okay, be careful. Yeah, you too. Don't do anything stupid. No. Yes? Peter. About the greenhouse... I'm sorry. [PANTING] [GASPS] Oh, fuck. [PANTS] [SNIFFS] [CHAINS DRAGGING] [SNARLING ECHOES] [DOOR SLAMS] [SNIFFS] [GAGS] [RETCHES] [COUGHING] Holy shit! DAVID: Peter! He's outside! Outside. Outside?! - I thought you said he was outside. - He is outside. I can't see him. [CHAINS CLINKING] Did you hear that? [HOWLS] It's a head! It's Andrew's bloody head! I can't take this anymore! We can't get out that way. We have to go out this way. [SCREAMS IN RAGE] [GROWLING] [STRAINING] [YELLS] Ow, ow! [ALL GRUNTING] Oh, do you want this, do you? [GRUNTING] You fucking mad, mad bastard. [GRUNTING] I swear... if you move one more muscle, I'm going to rip this bitch in two. Okay, Peter, get away from the trapdoor. You are going down in the cellar. Right, Peter, start moving that dresser over the trapdoor. We're going to lock the fucker down there. Come on! Get down now! Move it! Move! Come on, the fucking pair of you. I've got a whole book of these photos. [EXCLAIMS] [MOANS] [GRUNTING TENDERLY] No, David! No! No! No, no, no! David! You bastard! You bastard! You killed my brother. [SCREAMING] [CONTINUES SCREAMING] [GASPING] [STRAINING] [GRUNTING] [CONTINUES SCREAMING] [PETER PANTING] [GRUNTING] [PUNCTUATES BANGS WITH GRUNTS] Gah! Guh. Oh! Oh! [STRAINS] [SHAKILY] Oh... [PANTS RAPIDLY] [CLICKS LIGHTER] Oh! [PANTING] [SLAVERING] Oh, you must be joking. * [SCREAMS] * [] [RECORD SCRATCHES] [ELECTRONIC BEAT BEGINS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GRIEG'S 'MORNING MOOD' PLAYING] [CLOSES CAR DOOR] [ROARS]
