Comanches! Friend, I'll drink to you. Officer? That money could be put to better use by lighting a candle for him, and it would do you no bit of harm, either, sir. Well, hell's bells. Oh, uh, sir, if you'll not be using that gun, I'd appreciate you pointing it somewhere else. Thank you so much. You did shoot him fair, in self defense. Nonetheless, it was a deceitful shift you used to be rid of him. What'd you say, lady? Well, instead of whistling, I believe that a firm command of move and I shall fire, sir, would have avoided the killing. Move and I shall fire, sir? Yes. Where'd you come from? Who are you? I'm not important, sir, but this poor soul was. Poor soul? Lady, that poor soul just dry-gulched that poor soul. Well, yes, sir, but you being an officer of the law-- Not hardly. Oh, I thought you... Who are you? I'm Sister Mary Joesph of the Infant Jesus. And what are you doing out here? Well, I came with a freight caravan, when we were attacked by Indians. It was terrible, the savage killing. All my friends were massacred except for this good animal and myself. Yeah. Where are you headed? Santa Fe. We were to rest here a few days, but now somebody's burnt it down. 'Cept it's the wrong trail. And would Santa Fe be near, sir? 'Bout as near as a week's hard ride. And I've traveled so far, already. You see, Sister Paula and I were to meet our Mother Superior at Springfield, Missouri, but we were delayed, and so we missed one another. Oh, sir, you don't happen to have any water to spare? We've had none since early yesterday. Thank you, sir. Oh, the devil's own brew. I've tasted worse. Well, I haven't, sir. Yeah. Well, try back of the shack. I gotta get my horse. Taste better than your devil's brew? Now don't worry, I won't shoot you in the back. That's not what I was thinking, sir. Neither was I, lady. What's wrong? I'm trying to remember what Mother Superior told us to do in a situation like this. And what did Mother Superior tell you to do? I can't remember, but it doesn't matter. Can I ask you, sir, are you a brigand? A brigand? My question was not humorous, sir. Maybe not lady, but I've been called a lot of things in my life, but never a brigand. My name is Madron. How do you do, Mr. Madron? What the hell is that? An alarm. I set it five minutes before I'm to do my grand hour of silence. Your grand hour-- Of silence. It being a rule of community, I'm obliged to keep it. You mean you aren't gonna talk for an hour? That's correct, sir. I never knew a woman in my life could hold her tongue more than 30 seconds. You never knew the right women, Mr. Madron. Oh, now, you can bet your mule on that. Now, if you'll excuse me, sir, I'd rather be alone. You mean you're gonna sit here for an hour after all that shooting? Every Apache within a half a day's ride of here knowin' all about us? Oh, no, no, sir. I'll be but some 15 minutes, and then I'll give you a helping hand with those men back there. What men? The dead men. You wouldn't be off without burying them? You're goddamn right I would. Mr. Madron, I'll thank you not to use such language. Lady, I will thank you to get on that mule. Are you inviting me to accompany you, sir? No, ma'am. I'm tellin' you that if you don't get on that mule by yourself, I will tie you to the saddle. You wouldn't dare. Wouldn't I just? A brigand. Now, I've been storing up some words for the last hour, Mr. Madron, and you're going to hear every last one of them. Yeah, I was afraid of that. Who do you think you are, pushing people around like you do? I pushed somebody? You most certainly did, sir. I never touched you. Well, that's because I gave in just like a prisoner. But if it hadn't been for-- Lady? Lady, couldn't you set that watch of yours again, now? But I'm afraid I shall have to go my separate way. You're not talking about riding alone? We are none of us alone, Mr. Madron. God is everywhere. No foolin'? Lady, you wouldn't get as far as that first bunch of hills over there. I came this far. And you just about used up your luck. And look at that damn thing you're riding. He looks like he's been pulling a plow all his life. That damn thing, Mr. Madron, is a mule. And he was broken to a saddle the day before yesterday. You broke that mule? With a side saddle? Is there another way? Hm, I'll be damned. Quite possibly. Now listen, lady. Just once, will you listen, please? You are not riding alone. What would your destination be? I wouldn't want to take you out of your way. You're not. Well, Mr. Madron, I'm deeply appreciative, but I... Go light yourself a candle. Thank you, Mr. Madron. I'll light one for you also. Don't waste your money. Hey, lady? Don't take that off and leave those canteens where they are. This animal is tired, sir. Just loosen it. Why? Well, ma'am, if a bunch of Apaches come callin', you ain't gonna have no time to put that gear back on. They'd rather kill you and me than have a new pony. You want the first watch or the second? The first one would suit me, sir. Ah, there you go. Well, gentlemen, you seem to be some hands tall. However, if you happen to be any taller, you'll just have to bend your knees. Oh my, that won't do. No. Well. What the hell are you doing? Oh, Mr. Madron, the saints be praised. For a moment, I thought it was judgment day and our friends here resurrected. A stupid thing, that's what you're doing. I'm doing the moral and decent thing. This place, this time of night, we're not the only people that travel this trail. Perhaps, but these men will be buried if it's the last thing the good Lord allows me to do. That may well be, lady. And you can say amen to that. Now. Now, there is nobody in this world can make me dig this damn thing one inch deeper. Thank you, Mr. Madron. Those are lovely graves you dug for them. Lovely? Much better than I did. You did? Why, there were seven of my friends back there. You dug seven graves? Lady, get the mule. Right now! Move! Get up! Yeah, ha, look at that. Who are they? They are trouble. Whoa, there. Wow, look at that. That would be the work of Sam Red. That damn redskin! He's gonna get Madron scalped before we do. Oh, madre de Dios. Hey, Gabe. Hey, lookie here. Look what that redskin did. Ha ha, old Sam Red, he don't do no job halfway, not that stinkin' redskin. You ever wonder how much you stink to an Indian, Amigo? Cut it out! He called me stinkin'. He's right. You're stinkin' drunk. Ha ha, you're right, my amigo friend. I'm stinkin'. That kind I don't mind. You can call me that any time you like. If we are to overtake him before sunrise, we have little time left. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Oh, Mr. Madron, must you hurry so? You do want to get to Santa Fe, don't you? Well, indeed, sir, but I'm not capable of doing it in one day, and on an empty stomach. If I thought you could, you would. What do you think you're doing? Yeah, well, I'll go talk to the mule. Well, Mr. Madron, all we... Done it, again. Well, Mr. Madron, all we have to do now is wait. Yeah. What do you expect to catch with that thing? To be exact, sir, a sage hen. You catch it and I'll clean it. Alright. Oh, that won't do. You gonna roast that thing? I am, but you'd be eating pin feathers if I don't singe them first. Say, lady, if we're gonna be travelin' together, don't you think you oughta tell me if you got any more of those cute little tricks up your sleeve? Oh, I can fire a gun passably well. You mean a gun, gun. I wouldn't be meaning a cannon, Mr. Madron, though my father would've been delighted if I could have. Now, why would your father want you to be shooting a cannon? Oh, my father wanted a boy so badly that when I was born, he refused to face the evidence. Here. Which is the front end? God dammit, now that was a fool thing to do. I'm sorry, Mr. Madron, but you doubted my word. Hey, our dinner! Ain't gonna be any dinner tonight. Oh, but I'm hungry! - Now, move! Move! Mr. Madron, couldn't we roast the poor thing now? I said no fire tonight. I swear to you, sir, it's shriveling up inside that bag. Well, you got nobody to blame but yourself. Now you know somethin'? I'm glad you didn't take up the cannon. Is the fiddle in tune between us now, sir? Hm, yes ma'am. The fiddle's in tune between us now. Then would it be asking too much if we... The saddle gettin' harder? Oh, with every foot of the way. Alright, let's rest here and we'll move in the morning. Come on. Bless you, Mr. Madron. Hey, wakey, wakey, wakey. Come and get it or I'll throw it out. Come on, wake up. He's done it. Look at that. Done to a turn. What do you want, light meat or dark? Both. Mm, that is a good bird. Mm, what's wrong? I just remembered it's Friday. Don't taste good on Friday? I abstain from meat on Fridays. It's a day of fast. You're joshin'. Oh, I wish I were. Hours of silence, days of starvation. Lady, you surely make it hard on yourself. Mr. Madron, was it tender? Yes, ma'am. Get on that mule. Mr. Madron. Ah, Mr. Madron, must you hurry so? That mule can do better in this stuff than my horse. Yes, but there's a limit to what I can do. That's hard to believe. Nevertheless, let's try. When I said I would get you to Santa Fe, I didn't mean by next spring. Now keep up with me. Come on. My friend, this man has the power of meanness in him. But this much, I know: we'll not be eating any more of his dust. Come on. Oh, Mr. Madron, what happened? Oh, are you injured, sir? Don't you come an inch closer to me, either one of you. Oh, I do hope you didn't hurt yourself, sir. Alright, alright. Just forget about it. We're gonna camp down there tonight. You clumsy son of a-- Lady? Lady, it's Saturday. Bless you, Mr. Madron. Bless you. You're dead. You're dead! I saw you. You die in wagon train. Oh, no, sir, that... Oh, Mr. Madron, you're bleeding. No. You didn't think I was human? Where's that Indian? Oh, that is a very ugly wound. Where is that Indian? Oh, he's gone, scared as a banshee. He thought I was massacred, back at the freight caravan instead of Sister Paula. You turned him loose? Oh, I couldn't stop him. You had a gun. Well, I... Lady, you shouldn't have turned him loose. That was Sam Red. Well, he didn't seem so terrible to me. That not-so-terrible Apache had one of your padres in an ants' nest right up to his neck. Lady, what the hell are you doin'? Mr. Madron, I'm about to tend to your wound. Like hell you are. Alright, as you wish. Now, if you'll just inhale this. What the hell is that? It's called an inhalant. I know it doesn't smell very nice, but if you'll just sniff it, it'll make you feel much better. That's it. You see? There you are. That's right. A little more. Mr. Madron, can you hear me? Mr. Madron? I think I can start now. Feeling better? I might've known: a female medicine man. No, no, no, just a simple nurse, Mr. Madron. Lady, there ain't nothin' simple about you at all. No, no, no, no. Don't do that. You'll tear up the stitches. You sewed me up, too? Well, with a five inch laceration, I had no other choice. I didn't feel anything. Well, with the help of a little chloroform, you slept through the whole operation. Just step down easy. Ha ha, hey, lookie here. Ha ha! Oh! Gabe Price. Johnny-behind-the-rock as usual. You ever gonna use the front door? Man could get killed that way. You'd be dead right now except you talk nice. Come on in and I'll talk some more. Nice and easy or I'll have to guess what you're going to say next. Where's Angel? He's coverin' our trail. Apaches. Some idiot buried three of 'em back there. How'd you know they're Indians? Dug 'em up. Now who do you reckon would be dumb enough to bury them? No, it ain't possible. You burying Apaches? Not you, Madron. I got religion. Yes, siree, I'da buried the whole tribe of them. Wild, I love 'em like that. Where'd you find her? She found me. Well, she just lost you, 'cause I'm gonna get me some of that religion. No chance. What do you mean, no chance? You gonna stop me? They will. No dice, Madron. Me and the boys, we got respect for one another. Right boys? See? One big, happy family. Take a look. Take a damn good look. Now, I've had some of this religion, and it is powerful stuff. I'm willin' to bet my life the first two of you that try it, you're gonna end up with bullets in your back. You're wrong, Madron. Me and the boys, we figure on drawin' hairs. Figure again. Alright, what's your idea? Reduce the field. You figurin' us drawin' against ourselves? That way I'm dead. I'll take two of you with me. Whoever draws lucky gets two angels, that one out yonder and this one. I ain't interested. No? Alright. Do it. Get Singer over there. No, not me, boys. Count me out. So you can shoot us in the back. Get over here. You want out of this, turn around. You'll live 'til the next time I see you. Stay where you are, or if Madron don't kill ya, I will. Stop it, stop it! Please, don't, don't! No! You turned your back on purpose! Well, how else was I gonna get him to draw? But couldn't you have taken him prisoner? So he could do what he pleased with you after he knocked my brains out while I was asleep? First you distract him for me, then you come with this holy business. Now why don't you make up your mind? Oh, no, no, sir. I wasn't trying to distract him. I was trying to stop you. You what? Well, you seemed to be enjoying yourself like some dreadful game. Oh, yeah, lady. I play that game every night, right before supper. Wets my appetite. Damn shame about your dress. I'll try and be back. What do you see, Angel? Death, senor Madron, death in both our hands. And those shots, senor? Your amigos had an accident. Oh, Senor Madron, they were never my amigos. Just business acquaintances? Si. We sell whiskey and tequila to Sam Red and his people. We make lots of money, until you make Sam Red lose face with his people. Everybody want to kill you. And me and my business acquaintances have been drunk for four months straight. Drinking all the profits. Well, just to show you that my heart's in the right place, I'm gonna give you a chance to make a little money on the side. Oh, I got a choice. When it hits the ground. You're most thoughtful, senor. You win, Senor Madron. Shooting the gun out of Angel's hand was not an accident. I got work for you to do. Work? Work? Is not my debt enough? You've changed, Senor Madron. I hold you in esteem no longer. Yeah, well, it's too bad you're not gonna get a chance to get to know the new me. It might influence you. The world nears its end. Hey, lady, meet your new gravedigger. Lady of God, forgive this unworthy one for coming into your presence. He would have it otherwise. Alright, alright. Get the shovel off that mule and dig four of 'em. Four? Oh, Mr. Madron, you're not, you're not going to... You gonna start that again? Have you no conscience? Lady, don't you know the answer to that by now? Shee! Is this not deep enough, Senor Madron? I'm not so fat. You satisfied? I was satisfied without want, Senor. Me too, but like I said, I'm a changed man. Now, Angel, that is mighty sloppy work. I was never very good with my hands, senor. Except with a gun. Oh, well, I may have a little talent in that direction. Angel, let's see how little. Help yourself. Oh, I will, senor, but I was thinking to myself, you have not changed so much as I thought, senor. We all disappointments in the long run, are we not? That's a fact. - First I give you my word, senor, sworn on the memory of my saintly mother, that after I kill you, the good sister will never have reason to fear this one. Amen. And so. I'll shoot the hand of the first one who moves. Raise your hands. Please God they do it gently. I think the sister will shoot, senor. Can she? Mr. Angel, stand aside from that gun, please. Now, Mr. Madron, I want your word you'll not harm this gentleman. Gentleman? You called me a brigand! Mr. Madron, your word, please. You make one move, Angel. - Please, Mr. Madron? Alright. Alright! You are indeed a changed man, senor. Mr. Angel? My life is yours, blessed lady. I'll become a saint. Then return to the sacraments at first opportunity. I shall return, and God permitting. Now leave me alone, both of you. Now, you. If you so much as whisper about this in your sleep, I will remove your entire hide. Oh, senor, I have my pride, too. Well, then, do something. Si, senor, but what? Get outta my sight. Okay. You go with us. I'll keep my eye on you. I gave you my word, senor. And I gave you mine and don't walk on it. You want another special invitation tonight? Oh, no, senor. I go stand watch. Hey? Hey! You forgetting something again? My five dollars, like you say. I'll also be dead, senor. Sure you did. Let us have the good sister hold our bets today, senor. Suit yourself. Oh, Mr. Angel. Sister, will you hold this for us, por favor? But of course. Gracias. Why give it to me? You will know when the time comes. Say, how old are you? Most women would refuse to answer that question, Mr. Madron. Well, I wouldn't ask most women. I'm sure you wouldn't. There are a lot of things that I wouldn't ask most women. God dammit. I don't even know how to tell you that you are a fine looking thing. I... If you were anybody else in the whole world, I would tell you that I wanna put you down on the ground right here, right now, get on you, get right after you. Oh, Mr. Madron, I... I thought I... I tried to explain to you what a nun is. A nun? Lady, you're the only nun I know. Speak for yourself. I hoped, I had prayed that you would understand. Understand what? Look at you. Look at that, you're not even a real woman. You're just using your looks to try and sell something. Mr. Madron, whatever I am is not the result of my efforts but of God's love. Oh, horse shit! Would you prefer I went to Santa Fe with Mr. Angel? There is nothing I would like any better. We stop here, sister, to eat. Oh, thank you, Mr. Angel. Thank you so much. I must admit, I'm famished. Here. Will you have some cheese? Gracias. Were you and Mr. Madron such mortal enemies? Oh, no, but Madron knows when someone becomes a mad dog, he must be treated like one. At least I'm no longer mad, I think. I'm as certain of that as I am that our Lord sent you to me. Oh, mother de Dios, that could never be, not one such as myself. It is so. Mr. Angel, you have a lovely soul. If you would only give yourself a chance, a prayer. Oh, no, no, no. You make me want to run and hide, sister. Some agua, please? Thank you, Mr. Angel. De nada. Tell me, why did Mr. Madron give you such a dangerous advantage in your duel? In what? Oh, in your fight. Because he knows I held you in esteem. Senor Madron is a lot of things, but he is not a murderer. Oh, no. So Madron is a very good man? Si. Though he can be very rough at times, very rough. Many men would like Senor Madron, but he will have nobody, oh, no. He's a loner. Is he really? Si. But he has not always been so. It's not a very nice story, but he if wanted you to know, he will tell you. How do you do, Mr. Madron? The saddle off that thing, I'm in a hurry. I beg your pardon, sir? Did I hear you say what I heard you say? I'm changing the saddles on these two beasts. Comprende? Si, si, senor. Well, we shall see about that, sir. That money Angel gave you, you still got it? Now where do you suppose I would have spent it, sir? Well, give it to him, I'm paying off. But senor, we have a long way to go. Now, you gonna get off that mule, or am I gonna drag you off it? Muchas gracias, amigo. De nada. Would it be asking too much to know why I'm being robbed of this mule, sir? I always wanted one of my own. Sir, you are a-- A brigand. Precisely, sir! A brigand is precisely what you are. Adios. Well, I hope they skin him alive. What are you saying? Dirty double-dealing thief. He is certainly not a thief, Mr. Madron, not at all. What did you mean by you hope they skin him alive? Just what I said. Get outta my way. I gotta saddle this animal if we're gonna get to Santa Fe. Are you forgetting that Mr. Angel is escorting me, sir? Oh, that's changed, lady. I'm stuck with you again. And I didn't plan it that way. What way? What is happening? Well, that $10 you gave Angel, that was a bet. He lost. Mr. Madron, stop being evasive. Why did Mr. Angel go riding off? Sam Red is waiting over that next ridge. Merciful God, he's distracting them. And you were going to. Me? Hell, lady, I'da won the bet. Mr. Madron, we must help him. There must be a way. Not unless you got a whole sleeve full of miracles. Can he allude them? No chance. Mr. Madron, isn't it possible he could've escaped? Aren't you at all concerned? He's the one wanting to be a hero. Have you any idea where the Apaches might have taken him? If I did, I wouldn't say. Well, we could at least try to find him. But we won't. The price Angel's paying to keep you holy is a little too steep for me. Let go. If Sam Red does any dancing, he'll do it on both our graves. What is it? Apaches. What are those yells? They're telling us we're trapped. Are we? Yes, ma'am. Get down easy now. Don't make any sudden moves. Get over there, now, and get low while I try and figure a way out. We got one way out, it won't hurt. Now listen to me. No. Madron, alive. He killed the woman! Don't move, don't move. You're dead. Oh, my head. I hit a stone. Your head'll be alright. I just hope he didn't see the flash of my other gun. Now I'm gonna bury you. Oh, bury me? If I don't, they'll make damn sure you're dead when they come down here. Madron! At sunrise, Sam Red will skin you alive! Sweet Jesus. They bought it. After I finish burying you... Yes. I'm gonna lead 'em off. You're gonna hear some shooting. When it stops, wait a minute. All right. And then you get on that beast and hightail it for Santa Fe as fast as he can go. Ah, what about you? I've played these games before. Don't worry, I'll find Montoya. You know about Father Montoya? He's the padre I pulled outta that anthill a while back. How am I going to breathe? Use the tip of my rifle boot. It's a perfect air tube. Breathe, I'll keep this hole at the end above ground. Does it work? Yes. - Good. Trust me. Alright. Close your eyes now. Breathe alright? Yes. Alright. Damn! Sam Red, you coyote! Here's my grave. Come on and put me in it! Sam Red hears you, dog. You son of a dog, you want me alive, here I am! Madron will come for horse. They ran away. What happened, are you alright? Are you hurt? No, are you? No. They're gone now. Now it's gonna be alright. You got me, hold this. Easy now, don't do that. Don't cry, girl. Come on, now. They're all gone; you see, they left. I know. Here you are, it's all right. It was the funniest thing. When they saw me, they thought I was a ghost. Every time he sees me, he thinks I'm a ghost. How are, hello. I thought maybe you might like something warm. 'Course I can't make coffee worth a... It's very good coffee. I mean, it smells like very good coffee. You'd best use that. That's gonna be hot. Which way, um, how far do we go? It'll be yonder a piece. How far is yonder? 'Bout a night and a half's ride. Night? Why night? We couldn't hardly make it in the daytime. It's too hot, is it? It's hotter than the gates of hell. We have all we can do just to sit and breathe during the daytime. But it's real easy riding. Can't go faster than a walk. You just take your time. When you're ready, then we'll ride. Oh, ma'am. I think you're gonna be a little better off over here. Put it right in there. Lady! You're gonna run off one time too often. Mr. Madron. Lady, you have purely shamed me. You're not supposed to find the water, I am. Still, I guess I can't complain. Mr. Madron, would you mind-- Don't you think it's about time we dropped that mister? Yes, sir. Sir, who? What? My name is Madron. Madron. You say that? Try it: Madron, hm? Madron. See now, that didn't hurt a bit, did it? Oh, please. Say, what am I gonna call you? Not Joseph. Antoinette. Antoinette. Antoinette, you're not gonna go on makin' like a nun, are ya? Uh, no. Well, I don't know. Well, then, what? Well... Do you know how long I've been a nun? No. Seven years. And then, before that, I was a novice for five years. And then, you know, I was raised by the nuns as a little girl. Ow, God dammit. Oh, would you like me to help you? I mighta knowed. Yes, ma'am. Very well. Now. Oh, you are a glory standing there with the sun shining on your hair. And, about Sam Red. He did a bad thing to me and mine. I did the same to him. It won't die easy. Get up there. - My shoes, my shoes. Oh, dear. They know we're here? That's right. Sam Red's camp's right over that hill. Antoinette, I gotta tell you that I lied to you, and I make my apology now. You lied about what? About Angel. We can maybe help him. Why did you lie to me? Because it would mean some danger to you. I'd hoped you thought better of me than that. Now, Antoinette, I got no time for fancy explanations. Do you wanna help him or don't you? Well, of course. What shall I do? You get on the mule and you ride over that hill. When you get to the bottom, stay close. Keep bearing to the right. That doesn't make any sense. I think you're trying to get rid of me. I'm using you for bait to get their attention so I can get to Angel. I don't believe you. If that was your plan, you would've given me a gun. You haven't left yet! Here! Here! - I don't want it. But what about you? You can't help Mr. Angel single handed. This is a game I know something about. Now do you wanna help him or not? When shall we meet? Angel and I will be along directly. Well, tell me your plan and then I'll leave. God, why are you so ornery? Now, look. You get on that mule and you ride as fast as you can, just like I told you, and don't stop. If you stop, you and me and Angel are dead. Now do it! Alright. If you say so, I'll do it. Hurry back. Antoinette? I wouldn't have it no other way. And I wouldn't have it no other way. God dammit, amigo. Madron! Sam Red! Till love touches your life You drift and you wander and you roam Through towns And lives of strangers Till love touches your life Your heart doesn't ever feel at home You fight the world I wouldn't have it no other way. And tell yourself you're happy But when love touches your life You learn what it's really like to live The feel of home The learning how to give The need never to part The warmth there in your heart When love gently reaches out And touches your life
