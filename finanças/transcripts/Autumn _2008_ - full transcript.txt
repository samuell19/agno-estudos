Hello, Cihan? It's me, Yusuf. I'm fine, thanks. No, I haven't seen anyone yet. OK, sure. Let's meet. No, I don't have a mobile or anything like that. But I'll come into town tomorrow. It doesn't matter. You know what we should do? Let's meet at the post office tomorrow at two o'clock. OK. OK, Cihan. See you then. Thanks. How are you doing? Have you got yourself together a bit? - Do you have any kind of problem? - No, no. I'm fine. Really. Yesterday I called the guys at the magazine. They were worried. They hadn't heard from you. I don't know. Time goes so fast. Right. They said hello to you. They asked if you needed anything. No. It's nice of them to ask. I'll give them a call sometime. - Say hello if you speak to them. - I will say it. - What have you been up to? - Well, I don't know. Time just stood still inside but out here it seems to fly by. We had a boy, you know. Now we've got a little girl as well. Really? That's great. Are you in touch with friends from back then? I call them sometimes. Do you remember Sinan. He got married with Feryal and had kids. He brought his family and come from Erzincan to here last summer. We went up to the hills all together. They had a week here. Really? I'm so happy for him. I mean, he got to be a father too. Yes he got. We'd like too. Do you hear from Neslihan? - Neslihan got married, you know. - She did? Here, let's sit down over there. God... Remember the summer of 1991 when you start university... We spent whole nights out here. How could I forget? Wow! That was 16 years ago. Well, I guess that was our lot in life. But none of it was a waste of time. I'd do it all over again if I had to. Union confederations, medical chambers... ...and several other NGOs... ...have released a joint statement to end practices in F-type prisons... Yusuf, it's too late son. Let's sleep... ...that drew publicity when Behiç Aşçı, the lawyer, went on hunger strike. The statement calls on the justice ministry... Also speaking at the event was Aşçı's mother, Fazilet Erdoğan. Erdoğan, who ended her speech in tears, accused the ministry of gross injustice. Süleyman Çelebi, chairman of DISK, the radical union confederation... ...claimed that Turkey was faced with practices in its F-type prisons... ...that amounted to torture. First read the question carefully. - Got it? - Yes. Where did you go wrong here? On the nines. Whatever... Learn your times table up to the nines by next week... ...and let's be done with it. They dance so beautifully, don't they? There was a Russian duo back in my time. It was like they were flying through the air. Onur, what's up? Where are you going? Come and have an apple. Come back. I don't want to. I'm going. Why did you go and upset the boy, son? Yusuf son... If you're not going back to Istanbul, let me find you a girl here. Let's get you married. I could well die soon. Let me see you happily married. It's still early days, Mum. We'll see about it later. OK, then. It's up to you. - Mum... - Yes, son. Tomorrow Mikahil and me are going up to the hills. In this weather, son? You picked the wrong time of year. - Hey, Mikahil! - Yes? I wonder what the weather's like up there? There's no telling, Yusuf. There could be snow or bright sunshine. We'll see when we get there. Hey, Mikahil! Hey, Mikahil! Have you lost your way, numskull? Where are you going in weather like this? Up to the hills, Yaşar Amca. I know it seems weird. Good God! You must be mad! Yaşar Amca, did you get stocked up with booze? How could I? There's no place to buy drink around here. I've got a 70cl bottle. I can give you a double. Hey, Mikahil! Who is this lad? I don't recognise him. Don't you? It's Cemal Amca's son. He was in jail. Oh, right! The lad who got mixed up in all that anarchist business. Mikahil, drop me offjust ahead, will you? Thanks. Have a good trip now. Well, there you go, Yusuf. The highland hills for you! Hey, come on! Hang on in there a bit longer, Yusuf. We're almost there. Yusuf, are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. It's just my breathing. Come on. Get up! It's no distance to go now. - Is there further to go? - No, we're there. - What's up? - I'm done in. - But we're as good as there! - I can't take another step. All right. You take it easy while I'll go and light the stove. I was madly in love with Asiye once. Now I don't even want to go home. At least in the old days... ...there was hope of a life, of socialism, fuck it. However right or wrong. Now they've taken that away too. They've destroyed that, fuck it. Now their women come and work as whores. And the men nick the steel from the factories to sell. Hey, Yusuf! Get up! We're not done with the raki yet. Fuck you! Get up! Hey, Mikahil. You haven't changed one bit. Here, pass it over. Here we go then! You banged on about coming here but it's good you did. The weather's settled down. You didn't sleep all night, son. You were coughing all the time. Have you got sick? Here, drink this milk. Have a sip. What a chill you've caught! You don't go up to the hills at this time of year, son! Come on. Have a bit more. OK, say you didn't know. But Mikahil? He knows you don't go up there in winter. You're not children now. Damn those crows! They squawked and squawked. I wonder who's died. Who's died, Sedriye Teyze? Makaroğlu İsmet. Have you never had a lover? Yes, I have. Before I went to jail. We were at the same university. Where is she now? She got married. I found out the other day. You should drink less. Just ignore me. Nesibe, I want to get the boy married but he won't have it I don't know what to do. I want him settled before I die. Don't rush things. What's the hurry? Let the boy rest and sort himself out. When spring comes, he might meet someone at a wedding. Then things will happen. - You mean I should wait? - Yes, wait. The boy's only just out of prison. He needs to rest and sort himself out. I don't know. He won't get married, Nesibe. - Where are the keys? I want to take the car. - What's up, Yusuf? There, see? Get from over there. - Hello? - Eka a client is giving 100 dollar. No, Maria. I don't want to. Altough your visa finished why don't you come to work? I don't want to go out tonight. I'm going to stay at the hotel. OK. See you. Child... If you only knew how hard it was. What can be done, Uncle Vanya? We have to live. Whether we like it or not, we'll live, Uncle Vanya. There are long days ahead of us... ...suffocating evenings. We'll do our best to patiently endure all the tests destiny throws at us. We'll plant and harvest for others. Today and later when we're incapacitated... ...we'll still work without respite. When our times comes... ...we'll bid a meek farewell. And there, we'll speak of this. We'll say how we suffered in this world... ...how we shed so many tears and how we endured great sorrows. God will take pity on us. And both of us, dear Uncle... ...will begin to live. It'll be a radiant life... ...a beautiful life... ...a sweet life. We'll remember our unhappiness here... ...with compassion and forbearance and look back on the past with a smile. Have you been to the doctor? You know, you seem like you don't live in the present. It's like you've walked off the pages of a Russian novel. You know what I've been thinking? I wish I could leave everything behind... ...and set off on a long journey with you. It's a wild city the guys have got there, Yusuf. It's only five kilometres away... ...but look at their city then look at ours. I'd love to see Batumi. It's supposed to be beautiful. Hey, Mikahil. How long does it take does it take to get a passport? Not long. A couple of days. If you get a six-month one, it costs something like 250-300. Sand this, will you? Hey... If you're worried about money, don't be. I'll sort something out. Well... That would be great, you know. I couldn't explain to Mum. Not in less than two hours. Hey, quiet. Listen to that! Don't even mention it. I'm talking to you! Listen to me. I know your mind's somewhere else. If you weren't planning to work, why did you blow your visa and passport? You know what a pain it is to get them. Don't tell me you've fallen in love? Huh? I don't know. Do what you like. What a cute harmonica he has! Maria, you go to the hotel. I'm going to go to the shore and get some air. I don't understand you. Go get stuffed for all I care. Hello... Mehmet? I'm on my way back to Georgia now. OK. I'll give you a call when I arrive. We had heaps of chestnuts this year. It was obvious there'd be a lot of snow. Don't stop, Yusuf. You used so play so beautifully. Play some more, will you? To the beautiful children of this impatient times... who never chasing dreams
