Fuck, man, it must have really hurt when they did that. This one on my leg was worse. Pretty good! Shit, the cops! Let's split. But keep cool, ok? They might get suspicious. Come on, let's go. They're leaving. They piss themselves when they smell cops. A lot of tattoos, but they get scared shitless. - What time is it? - Don't know, but time to eat. Are we gonna go by that place? Think it's worth it? "For those under 20 years old... good salary and quick promotion." Fuck, you almost know it by heart. - This time it'll work out. - Sure, like it always does. - What time do we need to roll? - From 3 to 7. - We better get there early. - Then we better eat fast. - Hey, dad, how's it going. - Hey. - Can I make you some coffee? - No time. The taxi broke down. Only got two fares all morining. Fuck, why don't you tell your boss... to get you a new car? That thing's a junker. - Herminia, I'm going. - Will you be late? Your dinner's in the oven. But heat it up, ok? That's half of what's wrong with your stomach. Later. What screws up his stomach is spending 14 hours in that taxi. When are you going to start helping out? We need it. Have you seen Jos?? Yeah, he'll pick you up at 7. That good-for-nothing should look for some work. Oh mom, don't start. - Don't start? How many times do I have to tell you I don't want you seeing that guy? You should find yourself a nice boy who has a job and wants to get married, and won't waste your time doing nothing. What about you? Sit down, your lunch is ready. Pour me some soda, Sebas. I have to go or I'll be late. Where are you going in such a hurry? You can't wait till we finish eating? - I have to go meet Antonio... - Where, to go get high? No, Esteban, they're going to go look for work. Work? Those two don't want to work. Can I have one? It's rotten. Work, work, what are they cooking up now. Is this where they have the job openings? Of course, you have eyes? - Can we go in? The recruiter screwed us. - Sure, get in line. - Yeah, you heard him. - Down to the end. - Come on, let's go. - But it's... - Is this for job openings? - Yes, but you have to get in line. Your brother gets angry over nothing, so you have to be patient job hunting. - You know how he can be. - But he's got to do something, no? Well, of course. And damn, I can't take much more of the old man. One day I'll jump out a window, or throw him out. Jos?, calm down; you'll find something soon. We better go; don't want my mom giving me a hard time. Okay, let's go. Damn, boy, at it again? You don't stop. Well, you've got a girl to stick it into. I'd like to get it on with the math teacher. You should see her tits. The whole class has boners. So? Pretty good, huh? You're back in that again? Just wait to see what you're going to get into. You're just a whiny little bitch. - Pass me the rag, Pirri. - What rag? - The one you cleaned off with. - That was my sock. - Well, pass it on. - Fuck off, take one of yours. Don't be a pig, why get another one dirty, just to piss off the old lady. - Here, take it. You slob, it's all soggy. Get out of here. You're too much. - Where'd you rip that off? - What's it to you? Come on, shut up, I wanna get to sleep. Okay, man, don't get mad. Where did you work before? - Nowhere. Well, last year I was gonna start at my dad's gas station, but in the end the boss said he didn't need extra help. So nothing. What have you studied? You know any English? You have a driver's license? You have any computer skills? Any pending military service? Yes. You think you can lift those sacks? - I can try. - Well, go ahead. No, kid. This isn't a job for children. "Scoring goals throughout the championship... Six goals in total." The national anthem has ended. A few days late? Maybe you're pregnant. Being safe is very easy. Shop for Predictor at any pharmacy, and take the test right at home. A few drops of urine, a little shake, and a short wait. With Predictor, it's fast and easy. You have a pen? - Antonio, got a pen? - No. Predictor, Predictor. What're you talking about? - Nothing. But are you sure? Yes, Jos?... I'm pregnant. Dammit, what a mess. I didn't know what to do for days, and you were so busy looking for work I didn't want to bother you. I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure. But have you told your brother? - No way. And your parents? - Nobody, just you. Jos?, what're we gonna do? Please... Balloons, heart balloons... Hearts, get your hearts, balloons. Holy shit, look at those two. What a life. - Hey, Jos?, found a job? - No. Have you heard? He got hired to work in a movie. That's right, they said it's a movie about juvenile delinquency. Well, you know, if they need extras, let me know. I don't think you'd pass as a mugger. Nah, if you want to make it, you have to sell your ass. - What're you saying? You get fucked hard every day, 12 hours straight working behind this bar, with nothing to show for it. At least I don't sell my ass, man. Fuck, I don't believe any of this. Let's go outside. We need to talk. Something up? - Yes. See you, stars. - See you. All these movies they make about punks are so full of shit. Those movie guys, what do they know? You tell them to come talk to me I'll show 'em where the action is. Fuck, another one gets it in the ass. How stupid can you be. C'mon, man, it could happen to anyone. Not to a guy who knows how to do it right. How to do what? - Be careful, dammit. Don't you know how to hit the brakes? Not always. When you've got it in, anything can happen. So that's all you think my sister's good for. Don't judge me, I really love your sister. - You've got a lot of balls! - What do you mean? What I said, some balls. - What's that mean? You just think I'd be okay knocking up Rosario? You'd probably do the same to your mother. - Okay, that's going too far. - You just back off. Hey, those guys are fighting. Up your asses, punks. Tell me why, tell my why. You know that I love you, and you're fooling me. Tell me why tell my why Tell my why tell me why. I woke up this morning eager to get out of here. I woke up this morning eager to get out. I couldn't find anyone who wanted to follow me. Couldn't find anyone who wanted to follow me, to follow me. Far from here I packed my bags cold beer and a little hashish and I didn't forget my guitar that's the only one who'd come with me Can't find anyone who'd like to follow me I couldn't find anyone who'd like to follow me who'd want to follow me. Far from here Hey, Rosario. Can I come in? Come in. Here, light up. It's good. Nah, they'll notice the smell. No way, they've been asleep for an hour. - You rolled a strong one! - Yeah. It'll make you feel better, no? Have you talked to Jos?? - Yeah, he told me all about it. Here, gimme a hit. - I acted like a shit. - Why? 'Cause we got in a fight and it's all my fault. But what happened? When he broke the news, I just got so pissed. I mean you're my sister, fuck. - You didn't hurt him, did you? How could I? Jos?'s my buddy. It was bad but I'm over it now. Don't worry. Have another toke. Will you help us, Antonio? Don't be silly, Rosario, of course I'll help you. Gimme that roach or you'll overdo it. Come on, move over. I've been going crazy all night but I can't think of anything. It's simple, have the kid or don't But how are we going to have a baby? Well, that's it then. Get an abortion. Jesus, man, I'll have to try something. Try what? Maybe find work and, I don't know... we could get married, right, Rosario? Don't freak out, man. You're the one who has to decide, Rosario. If there's no other way, so be it, Jos?. The best thing to do is take her out of the country. No way, we don't have a dime. Without cash, it isn't easy. But what did you do? Where did you take Carmen? I didn't take her anywhere. What happened is she's got a sister in Germany, so she went and had it done there. Got it. Mine was easy because Miguel has a cousin who's a doctor. - You think he'll do it? - No, not himself. He's a doctor who doesn't do stuff like that. He didn't do it to me either, for the record What happens is he has these friends. And you know... I would like to help you, but... So you knocked up your girlfriend and gotta marry her? No, you know I don't have a girlfriend. - Well then? It's my si... well, look, do you know someone or not? Yes, man, yes, I'll give you the address of a midwife who does it very well, but you... You'll give me something in return, right? You're horny today, Elvira. Tell you what. Are you just gonna stick it in these twits... who are dumb enough to get pregnant? You never come to see me anymore. It's hard to believe. And I was your first time when you were 14. Whenever it's before the third month... there's no problem. So if you're sure, it's best to proceed as soon as you can. Now, yes, the main thing... is that you are certain and not afraid. I am afraid, but I still want to do it. It's always scary, but you must be brave. It's just half an hour. Don't worry. I'm a registered nurse; I've been doing it for twenty years and what I can assure you I've never had a single problem. - How much does it cost? - $400 Paid in advance. Really, I trust you... but that's how business is done. - Christ, $400. That's a lot. - Where will we get the money? Well, something will have to be done. Right, Jos?? Sure. There's no way we can get that much. Take it easy. Leave it to us. - What are you going to do? - It's not that much dough. Somebody'll loan it to us. Take it easy, maybe I can get it tonight. - How? - I've got connections. Well? Did you enjoy yourself? Come on, matador. Hey, Elvira, I don't know how to say this, but... What is it? - I really need $400. - What did you say? What's it for? Well, ma'am, it's for the abortion. I'll give it back to you ASAP. God, Antonio, $10 or $20 would be fine. I've done it before, but that kind of money... you gotta be kidding. Things are really tight right now at the bar. Honest, Elvira, you'd be doing me a big favor, huh? Well, let's see. That girl you knocked up, who is she? She isn't your girlfriend? No, she's... Well, if it's not your girlfriend, let her do it. She'll figure it out like the others. Let her turn a few tricks. Six johns should cover it. Or maybe less. Nowadays girls get paid well. Hey, if you don't wanna give me the money, fine. But I don't have to listen to that shit. Hey, handsome, you better listen. You can always sell your own ass and maybe make even more. - What's up, man? - What's up, buds? What're you doing here? Not much, just wanted to ask you something. What do you want? How about that movie? Raking in the dough? No way. They're really pissing me off. It turns out the production's flat broke. You're shitting me. Everyone in the movies is loaded. That's what I thought, too, but they're tighter... That sucks 'cause we came here thinking you could loan us some cash. What's wrong, do you have a problem? We need $400. Well, I know where you can get it... but I don't know if you'll go for it. Here it is. 29, 30 and 31, here they are. - We have to strip? - Yeah, of course. Don't stress out, buds. You don't have to have your dick out. This will keep your cock from flopping around. You have to go out in these towels. What if they want to stick it in me? How many times do I have to explain? They'll be satisfied just... jerking and sucking you off. That's it. Look, Mr. Tattoo's brought reinforcements. They look delicious. The brunette's not the prettiest, but what a body. Don't just stand there. I'd rather keep my ass to the wall. What pussies you are, come on. Hey, nice company you've got today. Yes, neighorhood friends. - Very nice, very nice. - Your first time here? This isn't really their scene. They just came here to make some extra cash. Don't be nervous. Two young bucks like you... shouldn't be so shy. No, we're not shy. Well, shall we go to the steam room? - Where? - It's in there. So, you want all three? - No, no, today we'll just try these two. How much will you give us? Depends how you behave, puppies. - We want $25 each, okay? - Heavens! More like $25 for both of you. - I want $15. - Me, too. Look at them, they seemed so timid. Good, then? Are they worth it? Looks like we'll have to pay for a new experience. Now, off we go to the steam room. It's so cozy and warm. Come on, boy, what's wrong? Don't know, I can't get it up. - How about yours? - Not much, it's big but limp. I can't take it anymore. This is no good. Come on, man, let's go. Wait, it's just that you're a bit nervous. Right, just open up and relax. Come on. Come on, fuck, you'll see that everything... is gonna turn out fine. Hit it. Here, got an empty stomach, I feel terrible. I haven't had breakfast. I didn't sleep at all last night. Shit, me either. We're such pussies. 12-year-old kids do this shit, and look at us. If my little brother sees us, he'll laugh his balls off. Okay, you ready to go there? - Give it to me. - You said you didn't feel like it? Come on, pass it to me. - We've still got time. - They open at 9. Okay, let's relax and finish this. Let's go. Smoke it on the way. The sooner the better, huh? - The old man is alone. - Like yesterday. I told you that joint would make me feel terrible. - You feel up to this? - Let's go. Good morning. Can I help you? Squeeze tight, dammit! Your cash! This is a hold up! This is all I have. What're you talking about? Don't get smart with us. - We just opened. No money yet. - There's gotta be more! Hi. Hi, Antonio. Where's the old lady? At the dentist for an hour. She'll be back. Well? Did you see that friend? Yeah, but... What happened? They didn't want to give you the money? Yes, but the problem is it'll take 3 or 4 days. "The shell is going to explode." Are you telling me the truth? What do you mean? What do I know. It's just that... Maybe you made up this friend and now you're trying to find some way to get the dough. You're all mixed up. Now the old lady's coming back. Hi. What a miracle, both of you here. - How was the dentist, mom? - Ugh, don't ask! I wish he'd finish with this tooth filling. Ah! Do you know who I saw? That slacker. Who? The one next door. He looked terrible. I bet he's one of those junkies. You're on those dentist drugs. - You're hallucinating. - It's so shameful... seeing her run around with that lowlife. It's not like we're the Marquises of Villaverde. Such nonsense. Don't you think your sister deserves someone better? Mom, I'll go out with whoever I want. Got it? And please, you're driving me crazy. Jos?'s my boyfriend, don't you know? And I don't give a damn whether you like it or not. Don't talk back to me like that, slut! I'll talk however I want! What about you? Huh? What are you looking at? What's wrong? I don't have to put up with this. Like I'm some stupid monkey. Don't shout. I'm not deaf. Hi, Esteban. Hi. Some heat, huh? And the kids? The girls are with grandma and the boys are in bed. - In bed so early? - They were bored. Damn, bored? At their age, I didn't have time to be bored. Go on, get me a cold drink, I'm dead tired. So, Esteban. Jos? spent all afternoon in his room. That's great. Way to find a job. No, it's... I find it very strange. I'm sure something's wrong. I've already asked him but he didn't want to tell me. Why don't you talk to him? Come on, woman. What's going to happen to him? Plus, if he didn't want to tell you, he's not likely to tell me. Here, real American cigs, man. - You'll wake him! - Nah, he's jacked out and dead to the world. Got a light? Whoa, look. What's with the knife? Put it back. - She's pretty, huh? Since when do you carry these? Give it to me. Take it. Go to sleep. I'm tired. One sec, huh? Let's smoke one first. Can I look in your other pocket, or is your gun there? Come on, don't be an asshole. Here. What's the knife for? For nothing. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Pirri. What? I'm in a mess. - What's wrong? Rosario, she's pregnant. No shit! Yeah, man. And I need $400 for an abortion. Yeah, and that's why you're carrying the knife, right? You couldn't hold up a total moron. Antonio's helping me. Antonio? Ha, what a pair. I've gotta get the money somehow. Why didn't you tell me earlier? That's what friends are for. Forget it. Better to just leave you out of it. Take it easy, buddy. I'm not gonna get fucked for you. But what do you think if we go talk to Colza's gang? What's up? What do you want? Hold on, we just want to see Colza. Yeah, what about? Just tell him Pirri's here, okay? Hey, Colza! There are two guys who want to see you. - Who are they? - One's called Pirri. Okay, let them in. What's up, Colza? What's up, kid? You guys holding mass or something? Nah, we just robbed a convent. You bang the nuns? Nope, they were uglier than shit. And who are they? This is my brother Jos? and his friend. - And what do you want? - They need some cash. I thought you could get them some action. You know we never work with guys over 15. What's wrong? You don't know how to make it? That's it, buddy. They're a couple of lightweights, and they only need $400. We going or what? Don't get pissy. Are you of legal age? I'm 18 and he's 19. You can go talk with Rogelio. You know him, Pirri? - Sure, but Rogelio... damn. From what I've heard, he needs guys with balls. Really big ones. - They're not in his league. That's what he's looking for. Chill out, he plays it straight. If you want to get in good, tell them Colza sent you. If your record's clean, there's no problem. I'll need your passports. How will we understand the Arab? Don't worry about it. Abdul was in Franco's black guard. His Spanish is perfect. Want some? What is it? Snow or smack? Coke. Good stuff. Sold. This stuff is strong, huh? Okay, stay calm. You go to the address I give you and the Arab will give you the package with no hassle. How do we get it back? Ah, you don't know? Sure, he never catches on to anything. Of course... Have you gone crazy? It's nothing. We'll be back in a few days with the money. What if you get caught? This guy knows what he's doing. Anyway, lots of guys carry stuff for the Arab. Look... If I knew you'd do something like this, I really... would've just told my parents. You're the one who's pregnant. I'll just tell them and it's all over. You could've thought of that before. We've been going nuts. You lied, you said a friend would loan you the money. You know, when you get like this... you're worse than the old lady. - If she wants to tell her parents, let her. How stupid can you be... getting involved in this crap. I guess I'm the only asshole here now. Do what you fucking wanna do. Antonio. What? - Don't get so upset. - Fuck it all. You're right. You've stuck your neck out to help us. I can't leave you guys hanging. All three of us have to stick together on this, understand, Rosario? Come here. Everything's going to be fine. In just one week, it'll all be over. Here you go. The passports. Spanish currency. Money for the Arab. And the tickets. Very good. Remember everything Rogelio told you? - Do it right, don't be a schmuck. - Stay calm. Nice gun, eh? You like it? - Shoots exploding bullets. - What's that? Pop open when they hit. They make a hole this big when they hit. Fuck. Come on, hurry up. The train leaves in 10 minutes. Good. Till next time. - Have a good trip. - Bye. - Bye. Well, my friends, five for each of you. But how do you fit all this in our ass? They work up into your intestines. Relax, friends, relax. I'll explain it to you. Cream. Apply lots of cream. More, more. That's it. Lots of cream. Good. Now, pull down your pants. Clean your hands on the newspaper. Okay. Now lots of cream in your ass, a lot. Raise your legs up like this. Come, my friends. Stick them in. That's it. Don't be afraid. Good, friends. Now another. Go on. Squeeze, squeeze. Good, good. I can't, man, I can't. Come on, dammit. The sauna would've been better than this. Look, there's Gibraltar. Some nerve the British have. They could give it back. - Give it back to who? - Who do you think? To Spain. Eh, I don't give a shit. That's what these things make me wanna do. Yeah, man. Me, too. But you gotta hold on, just a little longer. Express train from Algeciras... has just arrived on the second platform. Good. It's all over, right? It's about time. Thought I'd die. It's just your first time. You won't even notice the next one. I'm actually not making anything off of this one. But we brought in almost 300 grams. So what? That's nothing. That's for me and my friends. But I bet it's fucking good. I hope the Arab treated you well. Sure he has. Abdul knows he's gotta play fair with me. The stuff we tried to do was too much. Kid, the important thing is you did okay. If you want me to be honest, this was just to test you. From now on, you'll be doing serious work. We don't wanna do anything else. Then why'd you get involved in the first place? We need money. What do you think? There you go. Thirty bills. Go on. Who gets it? Go on, Jos?. Count them. You don't know how much we need it. What? Gotta bail someone out? No way. It's for an abortion. Why's that? You screwing the same girl? What the fuck do you care? No, it's for my sister. And my girlfriend. Okay, ready to go? What's the rush, man. Wanna do a line? We'd better go. The girl's waiting and getting nervous. That's what I wanted to talk about. I've got a proposal. That abortion thing is messed up. I have a better solution. Forget the abortion and you can make $4,000. Damn! How's that? Come on, let's have a couple of toots and talk about it, okay? Yes? Have you arrived yet? What a relief. I was scared. Take it easy. Everything's all fixed. Yeah, it'll take about an hour. Later. See you. - Jittery? - Like pudding. Here you go. A line for each of you. Good... My deal is really easy. I'm connected to a group... that finds babies for rich couples who can't have kids. They pay very well. I've already told you, you can make $4,000. You treat it the same. Drugs, kids, whatever... even newborns, it's all the same. You see. Guy's gotta make a living, right? Yes, but... That seems really heavy to me. Think about it calmly. Abortion's heavy, too, no? It's killed more than one girl. But my sister hasn't started to show and back home they don't know about it. What happens when it's growing? Yeah. Let's see, how old is she? She just turned 18. - No problem, the group handles everything. They can make sure... the family doesn't find out. Take my word for it. We can talk about it more... I can't say more now, but trust me. It's important you talk about it with her. But what if she says no? Don't be so sure. I don't care about the $4,000. But... Whatever you guys decide. It's not up to me what it's worth. - Yes, it's just.. When I see a little kid out in the street, it just makes my blood boil. It gives me terrible nightmares. - Do you want the kid, really? - Of course I do. Me, too. And what a lucky kid it'll be. A family with money, a big house. What luck. It'll be set for life. Wait, what're you talking about? You think it's normal to be selling a kid? It's better to sell it than kill it, no? Kill who? Right now inside you is a little piece of meat. It's not a piece of meat. It's alive. Like that weirdo who went and jacked off... into a river and after he popped off... he went around saying he had a sailor for a son. Oh, man. I'm past getting pissed off. I can't worry about this. It's not worth the hassle. You guys do what you want, but I'll say one thing. I don't like any of this. To go selling a kid like a dog, is so much worse than not having it. To hell with Rogelio. He's a dangerous character. He'll fuck you in the ass one way or another. Well, then? What do you think? Look, I think Antonio is right. Let's not mess things up anymore. Abortion, and it's over. Fine, come right in. You can wait here. In half an hour, we'll be done. Through here. Go ahead and undress. Lie down on the table. Come on, miss. Come on, there. Come on, let's go. Further back. Relax. Use this suppository. It'll relax you. - Wanna roll a joint? - Here? Are you crazy? - We could sure use it. - No, this isn't the place. Okay, lie down. Like that. And over. Like that. There, very good. Here we go. Spread your legs and relax. No! I can't. Really... I can't. Hey. Man. What's up, Jos?? Not much, Rogelio, we just wanted to talk to you. - Are those the ones? - Yeah. Really young. Yeah, but we've got them under control. Rogelio's always hanging around... with really young guys. You know how he is. Very good, you've made a wise decision. And you say you're in your third month? - Yes. - We have plenty of time. You don't notice anything till the fifth. We'll get you a phony work contract at a hotel on the coast. And your family won't suspect a thing. - So I'll need to leave Madrid? - No, that's a cover. You'll stay here, in an apartment. - And the delivery? - In a really great clinic. Don't you worry. Well, everything seems clear, right? And the parents... can we meet them? - What parents? You know, the couple who will be getting the baby. No, look, that's impossible. Even I don't know who they are. That depends on the organization. They'll definitely be foreigners. Americans or Germans. I don't know. - They'll take good care of it? - Yes, very good care. Don't you trust me? - Sure, of course. And above all, discretion. The organization is important, you know? It would be terrible if we didn't come through. Really terrible. You undestand me, right? You fixed everything, right? - Yes. - Got it all scraped out? - Let me shower. - Wait, bitch. I'll be late. I'm meeting my friends. - Hang on a second. - I'll wash here. Come on, bitch. More secrets? I'm fed up with these little games. And hurry up. - Hey, do you think Rogelio...? - What? - Nothing. - Got some more action for you? Come on, he'll stick more in there soon. Don't start, man. Who is that? Isn't anyone going to open? I'm coming, I'm coming. Good day. Police. What do you want? You see, ma'am, we're here to see your son. We have an arrest warrant. What's this all about? - May we come in? - Of course. Is your son here? What's he done? We're ordered to bring him in to the station. - Where's the boy? - I'm here, what's up? Wait a minute, wasn't the boy 15? Is your name Pirri? Stop sweating, it's me they want. - It's you, isn't it? - Yes, it's me. - You need to come with us. - You're not gonna take me in bare-assed, no? As you saw, they got Colza's whole gang. Pirri wasn't in with them, was he? He once helped them rob a drug store. He guarded all the speed and other stuff for them. They told the whole story when they took him in. - Finished. - Here, light up. What are they gonna do to him? Juvenile court. Not old enough for prison. He'll be out in no time. They might send him to a reformatory. - Here. - No, I better not. At least we know the kid won't get involved... in any of this shady crap. Really... it's too much, huh? Too much. We better go home, Antonio. It's lunch time, and the old lady'll get mad. Well, it's about time. What's up, been to jail to see your boyfriend's little brother? - Fuck, word travels fast. - The whole neighborhood knows. Anyway, if the young one's mixed up in these things, the older one is, too. - That's nonsense! No, it's not nonsense. I felt so ashamed when I went out to the market. Everyone was asking questions. If we were mixed up with that scum. Because that's what that family is. Trash. The worst kind of trash, got it? And your sister had to go there to find a boyfriend. Mother, don't you understand? You don't realize! If I go out with Jos? it's because I like him. And you can't change my mind. Oh, sure. And what about your mom's opinion? Don't you care? It does matter, but I'm of legal age now. I can decide for myself. I'm old enough! As long as you live under this roof, you will have to do what your parents want. If you aren't happy, you can leave. Okay, I'm leaving this house. Right now! Let's see how you end up with that worthless bum! - Oh, brother... - Don't oh, brother me! She wants to go, fine. She'll be back. You're not really gonna leave? - I can't take it anymore. These things happen all the time. Not for me, not anymore. So I guess that's it. Where will you go? - I don't know. - Come on, Rosario, dammit. Sit down. You better calm down a bit, right? You have to leave soon anyway for the kid. No, I'm leaving right now. And then, with that money, you do what you want. I'm leaving. I don't care who knows. Let the whole world know I'm pregnant. Quiet down, sis. - I won't be quiet! I'm sick of being quiet. I'm pregnant. I'm expecting a child and Jos? is the father. Do you hear me? I'm three months pregnant. - You're crazy, Rosario. No, I'm not crazy. I'm pregnant. Knocked up by that scum, as you say. And you know why I'm pregnant? Very simple. Because I slept with him. We've been doing it for a year, and I'm not stopping. Because I really like it. You hear me? I like it. Degenerate, I'll kill you! You'll never lay a hand on me again. Never again. Slutty tramp. Bitch! You skank. Whore! I already knew you were going to end up like this. I knew it! What's going on? I heard screaming downstairs. Your daughter. She's pregnant. That scumbag got her pregnant. What are you talking about? - Yes, dad, I'm pregnant. - You see? - That lowlife... - Hang on, let's see. See what? Can't you hear? We need to talk to the boy, no? Talk about what? There's nothing to talk about. - I'm out of here. - Please, Rosario... Oh, my God... Just kill me now. That's what you all want. Herminia, Herminia! Yes, driving around in that taxi all day... And you? You say that guy's your best friend? Well, look what he's done with your sister. How can you be so calm? See if you can do something with her. Fuck... Who could that be? - I don't know. I'll go see who it is. - I'm sure it's the cops again. No, I'll get it. Hey, what're you doing here? - Can you come out? - Who is it, Jos?? Nothing. It's for me. What's up? You won't believe it. She told our parents everything. - And what did you say? - Nothing. That I'm pregnant and you're the dad. Fuck. She even said she was leaving for good. - What're we gonna do? - I don't know about you... but I want to keep the child. Yes, Jos?. I'm not gonna give it up. God, another scene! - But mom... - Deadbeat! - Are you happy now? - Quiet, Herminia. You agreed to be reasonable. Just look at him! Like he doesn't know what we're talking about. Calm down, we'll talk to his parents. Talk to that trash? Like they'd show their faces. What's this all about? Oh look, you trashy people always live like this. Listen, lady. Go on, tell you dad what you've been up to. Tell him. Or does he know and think it's okay? - What did you do, Jos?? - I just... Just what? Jos? didn't do anything. A tramp, that's what you are! Didn't do anything. He got her pregnant! - Is that true, Jos?? - Of course it's true. Do you think I'm lying? I want my son to talk. Yes, it's true. We need to talk about this calmly. Good, then tell your wife to be quiet. Quiet? I'll show you quiet! Please shut her up or I will. No threats, all right? Enough of this. I won't stand for this. I think we have to talk rationally. - Just come inside. - I won't set foot in there. They can come to ours if they want. Maybe we should go to the police station. They know this type down there. Where are they going? What do you want? A room for three? A double and a single? No, just a single. That'll be $10 a night. ID cards, please. Let's air this out. Smells awful. Well... at least the sheets are clean. - Think it's all blown over? - No way. They're probably looking all over the neighborhood trying to find us. What if they find us? That lady down there has our IDs. I don't care. I'm not going back. Well, we have to go talk to Rogelio. For what? I'm not going to sell the baby. Okay, no need to get worked up. - I'll talk to him tomorrow. - We'll both go. - No, I'm going alone. - But why? Listen, I don't want him to see either you or Rosario. - But... - Dammit, I'm going. I'll fill him in and that's it. - Will this fit all three of us? - Yeah, lie down. If it collapses, we'll have a good laugh. Shit, my balls. Man... - Should we roll a joint? - Good. - You know I can't. - Sure, but... The two of us aren't pregnant. Here's all the information. It's a really good clinic. - The doctor will be suspicious, no? - Relax. The gynecologist in charge knows all about it. - Well, okay... - Don't worry about a thing. When labor pains start, go to the clinic and voila. - Sounds good. - Wow. You'll have twins if you're lucky. - I'll get more, then? - We'll work out a deal. - You get it, Parola. - See you later. - Good luck, ma'am. Bye. - Yes? This is Parola, who's this? Yeah, yeah... what's up, boy? Wait a minute. It's Antonio, the girl's brother. For you. Hello? Okay, how about tomorrow? At nine. Yes, in the morning. We'll see... You know the AZCA Center? There's a bar there called Rita. Bye for now. See you tomorrow. The fuck does he want? He seems nervous, no? - He was really terse. - I don't know. He was sent over by Colza... and they all just got busted. And the brother of one of them, too. - Yeah, curly hair's brother. - Could be bad. They haul those kids in by the dozen, Parola. That's what I keep saying. Gotta be careful with these kids. I know you like those heavy scenes... Don't tell me what to do. I can take care of myself, okay? Take it easy, man. So, that's what happened after she decided not to abort. And now our parents know all about it. But she didn't say anything about selling the kid, right? No way, man. You gotta ask? Are you sure? Well... We already had a commitment for the kid. What do you do now that it's sold? Patience. - Look, Rogelio, it's just... - Just? Jos?, Rosario and I all left home. We're all staying at a boardinghouse. - We don't have any money. - Hey, kid. You need to get by. Want us to set up some action for you? We don't know how to do it. Grow up and learn. You're not babies. We'll see... so what are you saying? I don't know, thought that maybe We could go see the Arab again, or something you can think of. Look, your sister really won't do it? No, for sure. If your parents know about it, then we're not interested. Not at all. I could be useful to you in other ways. Come on, kid. Don't make me laugh. - What's so funny? - I'll show you something funny.- You're gonna laugh till you cry. Okay, you two. Enough. Just chill. Look, boy. I don't have anything for you now. But Rogelio, damn. Don't leave us hanging. We're in a bad way. Hear me out... We're going to have to do something to get out of this, huh? Very well. Go to the bar and wait for me there for a moment. I'm going to ask Parola about something. Maybe we can find a solution. Got it. - What would you like? - White coffee. Wait, no. Make it a brandy. You're leading him on. Don't be thick, man. Tomorrow it'll be another story. They don't have a fucking peseta. They have to catch whatever. They might even try blackmail us. - There's only one way out. - What do you mean? - We gotta set them up for a good scare. - Forget that. The trouble these three caused, it demands more. We have to take action, yes. But all three. We need to find the other two. Understand? We need to really teach them a lesson. Got it? Where did you say your sister and your friend are? - In a boardinghouse. - Where? Why do you want to know? If we're working together, we need to know where to find you. So, where's the boardinghouse? I don't remember right now, but don't worry, I'll call you tomorrow... - I gotta get going. - What's the rush, man? Put it on my bill. You've got some time. Come with us. I really do need to go. Come with us to the car. Let's go to that boardinghouse. For what? We should all meet together. I want to clarify a few things. - Well, they won't be there. - It's 9:30 on a Sunday. - I'm sure they're still in bed. - No, they won't be. Come on, where are they? I said don't know. You're gonna get it, motherfucker. Over there. Antonio, slow down! We're not going to do anything. Come here, man. What the fuck is wrong? We just want to talk. Don't worry about Parola, man. - It's really high. - Jump, asshole. - But it's too high. - Jump, you pussy! Where did he go? Come on, let's get out of here. We're too in the open and cops might come. That bastard can run. Now what? He killed him. Fucker! What did you go? You can eat shit now! Come on, Jos?. Before all this tragedy, our two families came to an agreement. The best thing is for you to marry now. The girl's father and I will help you until you find a job. We knew you'd say that, but we're not interested. Aren't you going to get married? No, we're not. Then forget about help from me. Not a cent. No, we didn't plan on it. Then what's your plan? That's our business. What's going on? Don't you love each other? Yes. We love each other very much. I woke up this morning ready to get out of here. Can't find anyone to go with me Can't find anyone to go with me Who'd want to follow me Far from here.
