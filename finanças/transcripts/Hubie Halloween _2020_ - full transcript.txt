I talk to my girlfriend all the time. - I've never seen you with a girlfriend. - She is a Canadian resident of Canada. Uh, Canada Dry region. [Landolfa laughing] Mr. O'Doyle. Shouldn't you and your cohort be, uh, in school right now? - It's Sunday, dumb-ass. - [Hubie mutters] [Landolfa] Know what? I don't want the roast beef. - Give me some of the lamb's head. - Lamb's head? We don't have lamb's head. - No? What's that right there? - Which one? [shrieks] [screams] [all laughing] Got ya!

It's Kenny Fonda with the Westford PD. - How you doin' there, Kenny? - [Kenny] Good, buddy. Good. Hey, I just wanted to give you a heads-up. We had someone escape from the psych ward up here. A guy from your neck of the woods. Richard Hartman. Wow, uh… Richie Hartman's been locked up since Carter was president. [Kenny] Yeah. Just thought you might wanna know in case he gets sentimental for his hometown. And didn't you testify against him, Steve? He doesn't strike me as a forgive-and-forget type. Yeah, but you know what? I hope he comes looking for me. 'Cause he will be in a world of pain. - Of pain... - [loud slam] - [screams gibberish] - [Kenny chuckles] - [Kenny] What the hell? - I gotta go, Kenny. - Hubie, what do you want? - Hey, Officer Steve. I saw Andy O'Doyle buying suspiciously massive amount of eggs and toilet paper. - Not a crime to buy eggs or toilet paper. - Oh, yeah. That goes without saying. But it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to deduce malicious intent. - Okay. Yeah. - Lambardi's Pizza's doin' a sale tomorrow. One slice, one soda, one dollar, if you wear a costume to the shop. To me, that's a great deal, but it's also a riot waiting to happen. Call the hotline. I did call the hotline 100 times, but I think you guys got a connection problem. [phone rings] - Salem PD. - Yes. Your officer, this is Hubie Dubo... [Steve clears throat] - Hubie, get in here. - Okay. - Bring it in here. Get in here. - What's up? Now, it's Halloween. In Salem.

Well, it's not right what those hooligans did. We gotta expect a scare here or there. Kids being kids. - Oh, say, that's some heck of a thermos. - [Hubie] Yeah, that's my baby. It's kind of like a Swiss Army thermos. I made it when I was in the Scouts. Maybe you've had enough bike riding for one day. - How about if I give you a lift home? - You're not gonna have to drive far. 'Cause I live right over here. Oh. Wow. [chuckles] Your kids must have helped you with all of this. Oh, yeah, I don't have any kids. As far as I know. [laughs] No, I definitely don't. I do have a girlfriend. She lives up in Canada. Northern section. Ontarionto. So, you probably couldn't find her up there. - Ah. Look at those purple mums. - Mom planted those. And you gotta love the old-school ghost you got working over there. [Hubie] Yep. Scary ghost. Yes. And looks like we're neighbors. 'Cause I just moved in right there this morning. - [Hubie] You moved here? - I'm Walter Lambert. Hubie Dubois. It's a pleasure, Hubie. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna invite you and Mom over for dinner once I get my kitchen set up, 'cause I make the best chili east side of the Rockies. Ooh. My belly just said yes for the both of us. [farts] And your butt just made some room. They must've got loosened out of me with the landing. - It's... it's fine. It's natural. - It is. - Yeah. - Thanks. Anyway, you take care, Hubie. All right? - Yeah. - And have a happy Halloween. Oh, and Hubie. If you ever hear some commotion coming from my house, it's nothing to be concerned about. So, you don't need to come over and check on me or anything. In fact, it's important that you don't. Sure thing, Mr. Lambert. Walter. Hey, I'm home. - [shrieking laughter] - [Hubie screams] Ah! No! Ah! [skeleton warbles] [woman] Did that darn skeleton frighten you again, Hubie? No! I was just practicing yelling, Mom. Everything's good. Oh, dear boy. This town is making you so jittery. It just breaks my heart. I'm fine. Is that a new shirt? Mrs. Banerjee and I went to the thrift store today. Guess how much? Fifty cents! "Boner donor?" Now, what does that even mean? Well, I think boner's another word for a mistake. Like, I made a big boner in math class. So, maybe boner donor means I donate mistakes. That makes sense. I met the fellow who moved into the Andersons' house next door. Walter Lambert. Seemed like good people. - Oh, well, that's nice. - Yeah. Some improvement over those Andersons. The way they used to toss firecrackers at you. Oh, no. That was the Epsteins. The Andersons used to throw garbage into my bedroom window. Well, who was it chased you around the yard with a tennis racket? That was Dad. God rest his soul. - Oh, for sure. - [Mom] Cookies are done. You wanna help me frost 'em? - Can I lick the spoon, or… - [Mom] Deal! Okay. [chuckles] Now, I know that Halloween is very special to you, sweet boy. It's been your favorite holiday since you were knee-high. Well, we're Jewish, so that eliminated Christmas and Easter and Ash Wednesday. [grunts] - [jar pops] - [Mom exhales] And I am so proud at how hard you work to make sure that Halloween is safe and fun for everyone in this town. I'm sensin' a big "but" coming. - But… - Okay. …this town is as full of bullies now as it ever was in the 1600s. You have to learn to stand up for yourself. I just get scared. I know you do. We all get scared. But this year, you're gonna have to find that bravery that's deep within you. It's time. Ah, the good old days. When the town toughs only used to throw crab apples. Ah, Officer Steve. You always had it going on. "Most likely to marry his pillow." Still don't get that one. "Most friendly." "Most popular." "Best looking." The high school hat trick. Could not have happened to a nicer woman. Maybe if I wasn't such a scaredy-cat like mom was sayin', I would have asked you out. And the cutest couple would have been Violet and Hubie. - [pounding] - [screams] Monster! [screams] [Mom] Hubie, what was that? Sorry, Mom! I'll clean that up! [Mom] Did you make a messy? [Hubie] I said I would clean it up! It's not a big deal! [Mom] What are you cleaning up? Did you have an accident? [Hubie] No! It wasn't an accident. [Mom] It was on purpose? [Hubie] Mom! [trickling] [Violet] Okay, kids, you can't have candy for breakfast, but you can sprinkle some on top of your cereal. - [girl 1] Yes! - [girl 2] Oh, yeah! [segment intro music playing] Welcome back. You're Watching Wake Up Boston. And it's October 31st, which is a special day across the country, but most especially in Salem, America's unofficial Halloween capital. And it's gonna be a great day in Salem. Right, Jenna Thomas? Yes, Erin. Clear and a balmy 61 degrees. Ready for trick-or-treating and all the spooky stuff. Ooh! Get that candy, kids. And now, Wake Up Boston's Tracy Phillips is live with the Mayor of Salem, David Benson, and... Tracy, you went with Harley Quinn, too? Sure did, Erin. Only one day a year you get to show your ex what he's missin'. Hey! You know it. Ooh! Ooh! - Ooh! Ooh! - Yeah! So, Mayor Benson, the sun sets in eight short hours, but the spooky preparations are in full swing around here. Indeed it is, Tracy. As you can see, we're already setting up our world-famous Halloween parade. And a few blocks over, we got a street fair. And you're expecting some pretty impressive crowds here this evening. Oh, we're expecting over 70,000 people to visit Salem this evening. Well, I know where I'm gonna be tonight. Reporting from Salem, Tracy Phillips. - Back to you, Erin. - [marching band playing] - [Steve] Is this the way you found him? - [man] Yeah. And I was gonna take poor Peanut to the Halloween Carnival tonight for the petting zoo. But what kid would wanna pet a pig that look like that? Did you hear anything or see anything unusual last night? Well, I woke up 'cause the animals sounded agitated, and then I heard poor Peanut make a God-awful squeal. [imitating squealing] Squealin' like he was callin' for his daddy! You know what I think done it? A werewolf. Think you've been watching too many scary movies, Louise. And I think you've been eating too many of your own boogers, Dan. Oh, at least my mama don't stink the toilet up so bad, we gotta get rid of the shower curtain. Oh, you gonna bring up my mama in front of the police, huh? Ain't nobody say nothin' 'bout your big-ass mama. She come in the house and broke all the furniture. My mom wouldn't break up the furniture if you hadn't bought that cheap Ikea stuff and put it together with a butter knife! Well, if I had a real man, then I wouldn't have to do it myself now, would I? [Dan] Peanut's dead! We gonna eat Peanut tonight! [crowd chattering] [man] Look at these nerds. Unbelievable. You can say a lot of things about me, I was never a nerd. Hey, pimples! Pubie! Pubie? Uh, who's... who's Pubie? You are, Pubie. Landolfa called you that yesterday. Hilarious. Janitor, some drunk guy dressed as Captain Underpants just threw up in the jail exhibit. That's my cue. Call me if you get lonely, Violet. Don't call me. [groans] Wasn't plannin' on it. Hey, Dot. So, I saw there were massive lines out front. I took the liberty to print up some happy Halloween word searches. You can pass it out to the kids. Give them something to do while they're waiting. Oh, Hubie, how lovely. Thank you so much. Of course. So, Violet Valentine. Good to see you. Happy Halloween. - Thank you. - What brings you here? I am chaperoning my daughter's field trip. She's over there. Danielle! Danielle! Say hello to Hubie. Hi, Hubie. What school do you go to? No. He's a grown man. I've known him since kindergarten. Yes. We had Miss Colestice's class together. - Yes, we did. - You were the first kid to get earrings. [chuckles] I was. Oh, I'm sorry. I just thought 'cause of the thermos. Oh, why? Do you want some soup? - Uh, no, thanks. - Your friends? All right. It's here if you want it. - [laughing] What was that? - What was that about? What a nice young lady. I remember you just had a foster son. Yeah. Well, I've got two foster daughters now as well. Huh. That's quite commendable. Looking out for the community. That's important. Of course. That's my great-great-great-great-great grandmother. She saw some bad things happening, but she spoke out. Said there's no such thing as witches. - Very brave. - Yeah, maybe too brave. 'Cause they called her a witch and ended up like this fella. - [Violet] Ooh. - [Hubie] The unfortunate dangling Dave. God, I love the way you phrase things. Okay. So, how are you and Officer Steve doing? I saw him yesterday in his squad car. We were talking shop. You know, code 10-4, 10-5. That kinda thing. Well, since we've been divorced four years, - I don't really know how he's doing. - Oh, well, don't lose faith. You guys will get through this rough patch. Did you hear about the Andersons? I met the fellow who moved into their home. A Walter Lambert. Seems like a decent guy. - [Violet] Walter Lambert? - Yeah. There's a Walter Lambert buried right near my grandpa in the Pine Street Cemetery. Okay. I only remember that name because there is something off about his tombstone. - Off how? - Well, I know you, Hubie Dubois. - Mm-hmm. - You'll see.

By the way, I wanted to say that I'm sorry for my attitude yesterday at the deli counter. [stammers] My dad, you know, he died unexpected, and I just haven't been myself these past few days. This is your dad's funeral? I'm so sorry. I didn't... My father passed away a couple of years ago. It is very painful. It's... - Ups and downs, emotionally. - Yeah. My dad was a serious man. He worked hard every single day of his life. Mm-hmm. - But he did love to laugh. - Okay. And I know he would get a great chuckle out of this. [screams, thuds] [laughing maniacally] Have fun, Pubes.

I don't really believe in keeping track of that kind of thing, Hubie. You know, age is just a state of mind. That's why I played T-ball till I was 25. Hubie Dubois. [school bell ringing] I can't believe it's finally Halloween. My parents got me a royal princess dress from the Disney Store. - Cooky, what are you gonna dress up as? - A robot.

We have a special presentation today in lieu of recess. [kids groaning] Here again to talk about Halloween safety is Salem's Official Volunteer Halloween Helper, Hubert Dubois.

Just playing. My name is Hubie Dubois, and I am here to tell you that Halloween is fun, but we must stay out of the danger zone. [kids jeering, clamoring] Hey! Hey! Hey! Let him speak. He's a human being! Thank you, sir. I would like a word with you all. And that word is… G-ghost? Ghost. Scary. But also the key to Halloween safety. The G. - What could the G stand for? - Go home? No. Give. Give to the less fortunate. Does anyone know what less fortunate is? - Yes, sir. - It means someone who needs help. Very good. What's your name? - Cooky. - Well, you're a smart cookie. When I was young, I used to build a tower with all my candy. And all the candy that was part of the tower before it collapsed, I would keep for myself. The leftover candy, I would donate to the homeless shelter. Is that where you live? Well, son... [screaming] Burn him! - [crying] - Oh. I'm sorry, son. I just... Please... please don't cry.

If you can play the theme song from the film Ghostbusters by Ray Parker Jr. [Aurora] Hubie, you need to turn down your radio. - We talked about this before. - [echoing] I just keep hearing myself. - [Aurora] Hubie. - Okay, there it is.

Officer Steve, I saw my ne... Never mind that. Cop a squat. - Here? - Yeah. Hubie, how long have you lived in Salem? Eh, my whole life. Now, you've brought us many instances of unlawful conduct to our attention over the years. Somebody put a firecracker in my mail slot. There's a diaper in Dori's pond. There's a weird station wagon at the senior center. The supermarket is selling expired bacon. Janet at the library has not been herself lately. I heard a voice in the sewer. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize him. The power of observation, the ability to blend in. That is you in a nutshell, Hubie. Well, Steven, let's talk turkey. May I? Mmm… I only have 30 left. Okay. You ever hear of an AUU? I don't have an Internet, so I'm not up on my latest abbreviations. Illuminate me. AUU stands for "Auxiliary Undercover Unit."

First off, there's no salary. - [exhales] - There's no badge. - [exhales] - We can't acknowledge you officially - in any way whatsoever. And... - [exhaling] And the most important thing is you can never be seen talking to me or any other officer in this place. [exhaling] A question. How would I go about getting the information to you? Oh, you just keep a log. A very detailed log. And you drop that log right here. In the garbage can directly outside Town Hall. So, drop a log in a garbage can? Well, that garbage can, that's monitored, 24-7. So, any intel that you have, it's gonna get to us. We'll know about it. - Makes... makes sense. - Yep. But remember, you cannot contact us, no matter how dire the emergency. - Yeah, I heard you the first time. - Yeah, I said it twice, it's important. - Gotcha. - So, you ready to join the team? Put me in, coach. I'm ready to play. [Steve] All right! Perfect. Tommy, I want mom to bring half my candy to the homeless shelter in the morning. Will you tell her when she gets home? Tommy? Tommy! Tommy? Tommy, where are you? [horror movie music playing] Danielle! Mom isn't home yet, and I can't find Tommy. I'm scared. - Did you check the basement? - I checked everywhere. He's not here. You know what that means? Our brother's in love. Ew! [screaming] ["Dancing with the Devil" playing live] ♪ Ghosts and goblins very scary ♪ ♪ Wolfman's back is very hairy… ♪ How we doin', ladies?

Then maybe should I head inside? A wise decision. By the way, my mom was talking about you tonight. Your mom was talking about me? What'd she say? Just that you are nice. Well, I am nice. Because I'm not gonna tell her that you're out here playing Romeo instead of watching your two little sisters. - Well, now I feel bad. - I know you feel bad. - 'Cause you got a big heart. - Thanks. So, I'm gonna let you two guys take off without me. I'll give you a head start in the name of romance. - Okay. Go ahead, guys. Take care, now. - [Tommy] Thanks, Mr. Dubois. - [Megan] Happy Halloween. - Not looking, guys! Same corn over and over. I should've left with the others, 'cause I have no idea where I am.

[Aurora] But that don't mean the fun stops for all of us. - Hubie, I can't do this. - Michael Mundi was abducted. I found a ticket to the drive-in at the scene. Great. Start there.

Mm-hmm. Feels exactly the same, too. We got Hubie Dubois spying on everybody. I gotta say, it's pretty impressive how long he's been a loser. - I got a great idea. - [woman on-screen screaming] It's kinda evil, but stick with me. Now, that turns me on.

Something suspicious. Ears are in open position. This is gonna sound nuts. But I was going to get popcorn earlier, when this freaky old-timey car pulled into the lot. And the driver was... You just gotta see it to believe it. Could you possibly point me in the direction of this strange vehicle? It's that one. Right there. Okay. Let's take a look. - Oh, and, uh… - Yes? Hubie, do be… careful. [man on-screen shouting] [car starts] What the what? Okay, whoa, there. Step out of the vehicle! We can do this the easy way or the paddle way. It's up to you.

[chuckling] I'm sorry about before. In the basement. I really wasn't feeling myself. I don't know if I like you much better now. You didn't tell anybody about that, did you, Hubie? Why? You have secrets, Mr. Lambert? As in, secretly dropping by the corn maze earlier tonight? Did anybody get... [panting, heaving] - Mr. Lambert. - Walter. Your tombstone says that you have yet to die. Are you a human being, or are you a moon-crazed beast from beyond the grave, grave, grave? [snarling, howling] Hold that thought! I gotta split! Mr. Lambert! That just answered my question. [crowd cheering, clamoring] [male announcer] Oh, man. That's another one. [marching band playing fanfare] What a man! What a mouth! And on his first try. Have a round of applause, everyone. Who's next? If the mayor can do it, so can you. You, sir! Step on up. Sorry to bother you, mayor, but it's important. [muffled muttering] [gasps] What is it, Sergeant? About an hour ago, I got a strange report of a missing high school kid from Hubie Dubois. After I laughed it off as usual, I got a call from the kid's mother. He actually never made it home. This Richard Hartman thing has got you jumpy as hell. I suggest we cancel the fireworks show immediately. We ain't canceling a damn thing, Sergeant. We got an unsolved mystery! Eighty-five percent of the tourism dollars spent in this town are spent on Halloween night. And I'm not gonna let no high school peckerhead jeopardize that. - I just think that... - Trick-or-treat, smell my feet. - I just think that you're not... - Smell my feet. - I just think that... - Smell my feet. [marching band continues playing] You really want me to smell them? [owl hooting] [dog barking in distance] [distant howling] Let's just go back, Danielle. I don't want Mom to get home and see that Tommy left us by ourselves. I think we'll all get in really big trouble for that. Are we even going the right way? Excuse me, sir? Do you know the quickest way to Wallace Orchard? - ♪ It was Halloween night at the castle… ♪ - Hey, handsome. Soup's ready. One clam, one chicken noodle, and one split pea. So, you seem a little stressed. I mean, what can I do to help ya out? Maybe a glass of Chardonnay? Well, to be honest with ya, I don't drink beer. But do you have any silver bullets? That is not on the menu tonight. But I happen to be an excellent listener if you want to, you know, share anything with me. Okay. We all have a purpose. Some people's purpose is to make sure all the streets are clean. Some people's purpose, like Kenny Rogers', is to make sure there's great tunes on the radio that we can all sing along with on road trips. Some people's purpose, like you, are here to make sure that kids without parents end up with a mom anyways. Who is nice and kind to 'em and makes them feel loved. - You happen to have any A1 Sauce? - Yeah. My whole life, I felt my purpose was to make sure everybody was safe and sound on Halloween. But tonight, I have failed massively. [thermos whirring] Because a fine young man was abducted under my watch. - That's on me. - No. Mmm. [turns thermos off] How can I help you? You just did help me by listening to my story. Be careful today. Danger is afoot. Oh, well, I don't worry about me. I worry about my kids. Called home. None of 'em picked up. They're probably just watching a movie, though, and… - Tommy's keeping an eye on them. - Tommy? I'm sure he's been there the whole time. Without a doubt. The night is young. Appreciate you being nice to me. Of course, Hubie. You're the best person I know. You're always thinking of everyone else and never of yourself. But I guess that's why you're a hero. [giggles] Did you see how scared Scooby was when that car started moving? [laughing] - With his ping-pong paddle at the ready! - Oh, my God! What a buffoon! [mocking Hubie's voice] Mr. Hennessy! Mr. Hennessy! [screams] [tires screech] There's somebody in the road. - Who the hell is that? - It's not moving. Looks like a dummy. You look like a dummy. Go out and get it out of the way. Okay. [puffs, inhales] Now, see, that does it for me. You like that? No. [open door alert dinging] [text keys tapping] Scarecrow? [Mr. Hennessy screams] Lester! Lester! I'm gonna kick your ass for this, Lester. I swear to God, if you jump out of one of these bushes, I'm gonna punch you in the face! What the... Lester! [panting] Where are you?

Happens every year! [grunts] [panting] [grunting, shrieking] [gasps] Oh! [wailing] [grunting, screaming] [handcuffs clicking] Not tonight! [gasping, grunting] [panting] [sighs] We need to talk. [Tommy] They're not up here. [Megan] They're not down here, either. Danielle! Cooky! - We didn't find them. - Hey! It's okay. We'll figure it out. - We'll find them. - [pounding at door] [Tommy] Oh, no. [doorknob rattling] [creaking] [all screaming] What are we screaming at? [Tommy and Megan sigh] - Bam. - Mr. Dubois, I screwed up. - I can't find my sisters. - You don't know where the kids are? Huh. 'Cause I do. They're right here. - [girls] Tommy! Tommy! - Oh, my God! I'm so sorry I left guys. I'm so glad you're okay. You are so cute with them. You have a girlfriend? I saw 'em coming through the Old McMillan shortcut. It was funny, 'cause not many people know where that shortcut is. Just me and a friend of mine, Richie Hartman. When I was a kid, we used to finish our band practice and shoot right through there. - Well, at least everybody's safe. - No one in Salem is safe tonight. Do you understand me, Tommy? That's why I'm putting this family on lockdown. Now, Tommy, you call your mother. Let her know you're home. Megan, you call your parents. Let them know you're staying at a friend's. That's for you. You two, do me a favor. Eat all the candy you want, and then go straight to sleep. And lock this door! No matter what, don't answer it! What're you gonna do, Mr. Dubois? I'm gonna do what I do every October 31st. Make sure every citizen in this town is safe and protected. Um, but do you have a bathroom I could use? 'Cause I, uh… The soup kinda went right through me. Upstairs. Toilet? Is it a big toilet? 'Cause I got a lot to do. [howling in distance] [barking, howling] I know that howl. [howling continues] Walter Lambert! [howling continues, loudly] [girl screaming] [crowd chattering] [man laughing maniacally] [howling continues] The transformation is complete. [dog grunts] While I understand that you are now a mindless killing machine, I would like to speak with the human being that is deep down below your fur. [girl screaming in distance] Mr. Lambert. [dog grunts] Walter. I cannot, in good faith, allow you to hurt another soul tonight, even though this is Halloween, and even though I know this is... Mr. Lambert, you're better than that. You... Did you really wanna defecate in front of me, sir? Oh, now, you're eating it! Is that Michael Mundi you're eating right now? Is he inside your feces? - [barking] - Mr. Lambert! Get over here! [woman screaming] [man screaming] [Hubie's voice] The only way to slay the beast is a silver bullet right between the eyes. [hollering] Yo, dawg! That's my bullet! [Hubie] Come here! [hollering] Oh! [panting, screaming] Mr. Lambert? [spooky theremin music playing] Mr. Lambert. Mr. Lambert? [moaning, crying] Mr. Lambert. - [screeching, snarling] - [Hubie screaming] [screams] Mr. Lambert. This is not your fault! You are cursed! Hello. [screaming] Mommy! No! Help me, Mommy! Help me! Help me! [sobbing, heaving] - [man] And stay out! - [women laughing] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That was so terrifying! - That was even crazier than last year! - Yes! - How much fun was that? - That was so much fun. [laughing] It almost made me forget that I buried my father today. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's a good thing. I mean, not for him so much, but it's given me time to be introspective. - That's good. - I'm Pete Landolfa. Oh, I'm Chantal. - Chantal? - Yeah. [spooky theremin music playing] Come to me. Walter. Come! Here, Walter. [patting leg] I don't wanna do this. You've been a very good neighbor to me. But what has to be done, has to be done. Right between… The eyes! Oh, no. - [dog barks] - No! Homeboy. Are you okay, man? [screaming hysterically] - Dude. - No! This is not real. You get that, right? We're just trying to raise money for our school. [continues screaming] Wait a second. - Are you hittin' on me? - [laughing] Because if so, that is incredibly sick. We're having a conversation. Mm-mmm. 'Cause you're, like, three times my age, okay? Thrice. I was born around the same time you had your first heart bypass. - [dog barks] - Oh, Buster! Hey, my big boy. Are you here to protect me from this weirdo man that's trying to hit on me? - [screaming hysterically] - [growls] [screaming] My eyes are on fire! - Why would you mace me? - Yo. I'm a dentist. I help people! Liar! Lucifer! [laughing] That sounds like Hubie Dubois. And since I struck out with you, I'm gonna take it out on him. Have fun with that. [man laughing maniacally] [panting] [maniacal laughter continues] [gasps] Oh! Oh! You gotta be... Whoa. [chuckles] There's this goof headed his way. Hubie Dubois. When he gets here, I'll handle the scaring. You just sit back and enjoy. [snickers] [Hubie] Attention, haunted house patrons. This is a direct order from the AUU. Move quickly and quietly toward the exits. The man-wolf has eaten his kryptonite! Pubie! [screaming] [gasps] Huh? Oh, my God. This is a travesty. First, Mike Mundi. Now, Mr. Landolfa. And why would God do this to such good people? Good people? All those two ever did was abuse you, man. You know who should feel bad right now? Our wonderful mayor. I'm truly sorry. You knew that high school kid from the corn maze was missing. - But you told nobody. - Yeah. Bad for business, I guess. Oh, they just found Lester Hennessy's car abandoned in the middle of Whipstick Road. - No sign of Lester or Mary. - No! So, we are cancelin' the fireworks and all other related Halloween activities. - Officer Steve. - Not now, Hubie. - I think I know who did it. - Oh, so do I. His name… Is Walter Lambert. - Walter who? - Lambert. Scientists would call him a lyco-thorpe. I think he means a lycanthrope. - Is that what it is? - It's a werewolf. - Okay. - Hubie, I will lock you up. - I got four people missing here. - Officer Steve, listen to me. I saw the man destroy his home earlier today. Then I saw him in the pumpkin patch. His shirt was torn up. He was barking at the moon. His arms were very, very hairy. Then I saw him at this haunted house, his tail wagging in murderous glee. - Wait, you talking about my dog, Buster. - That was Walter Lambert! Where does he live? Fifty-Nine Elm Street. Check on it. - There's your killer. - [man on phone] Salem PD. Blake, I need you to go out to 59 Elm. There should be a guy there. New in town. Possibly shirtless. Yeah. Middle-aged, growls a lot, glue-on hairy hands? Yeah, I got him right here. Him and your boy, Richie Hartman. They both came by and turned themselves in, like, 45 minutes ago. Together? Yeah. Apparently, Lambert is Hartman's roommate at the mental hospital. Sorry. Werewolf Treatment Center. Lambert broke out about a month ago, and then Hartman broke out yesterday to try to find him and convince him to come back. It's actually pretty sweet, isn't it? So, you've had eyes on them for 45 minutes? [Blake] Almost, like, an hour now. And also, Lambert's real name is Nick Hudson. Yeah. Walter Lambert is just some name that he got off a tombstone on his way into town. All right, Blake. I got it. Thank you. I feel bad you got yourself in even more trouble just to save me. No, it was good to get out of that place for a while. - You did me a favor. Thank you. - Did you do anything fun? I pissed on a tombstone, pissed on the street. Just some fun pissing stuff, you know. - Nobody pees more than you. - I'm peein' now. [both laughing] - That's a good roommate. Yes. [chuckles] - [sniffing, panting] - Who's a good roommate? Yes. Yes. - [barking] [Hartman chuckling] Yes, you are. Lambert and Hartman have been in custody during the whole Landolfa disappearance. So, it couldn't have been them. - [dog whimpers] - Buster, my baby! Oh, by the way, he ate a silver bullet if you wanna check his feces tomorrow. I ain't doin' that. Then who? Are there any clues? Landolfa did go back into the haunted house to look for Hubie. Yeah. Hubie seems to be around a lot of people before they go missing. - People who have messed with him. - Did the Hennesseys mess with Hubie, too? Oh, they live for it. So, it was payback time. Wasn't it, Hubie? No, I would never hurt anybody. I... You got the wrong guy. - Father Dave. - Have you been planning this all along? - [snarling] - You sick man. - Have you? - I... Have you? Frankenstein! [dog grunts] [woman groans] Did we just fall for the old Frankenstein trick? [whimpering] [screams, thuds] [crying, whimpering] [screams] Oh-ho! [yells] Ya! [shrieks] [whimpering, screaming] [hooting] [grunting] - [Aurora] Bad news, gang. - [thunderclap] WTCH has just learned that Salem's Halloween is getting shut down. - [growling] - [Hubie screaming] [Aurora] The police department is advising everyone to stay home and lock doors. But, my little Halloweenies, we can all still celebrate with nature's fireworks lighting up the night sky. [thunderclap] Not sure what's happening in this creepy town, but sounds like a good idea to cuddle up with someone special and enjoy the last half hour of Halloween under the covers. And just hope that whoever you cuddling isn't a madman. [Aurora laughing maniacally] [mouthing] [thunder rumbling] Well, looks like I have company. So, we're going to take a word from our scary sponsors. - [whistles like theremin] - [man] W… T… C… H. - Aurora? - [gasps] - [deep voice] Hubie Dubois. - Yes. I'd recognize that voice anywhere. You look exactly how I pictured you. To be honest with you, you don't look like the way I was picturing you. [high-pitched voice] I guess my radio voice throws people off sometimes. Yeah, that... I think that's it. [giggling in high-pitched voice] [deep voice] Have a seat, man. ["Werewolves of London" playing] What brings you all the way here this evenin'? As you know, I'm a longtime listener, and I always respect the advice you give to so many callers. Right now, I'm in dire need of the most perspicacious advice - you have ever given to any other human... - [knocking] [Aurora gasps] Oh, my God. Isn't that so sweet? My wife brought snacks. [deep voice] Ooh! Hey, baby. How you doin'? Oh, and who is this? Baby, this is Hubie Dubois. Whoa! For real? Yes. Nice to meet you, ma'am. I'm looking forward to hearing your real voice. This is my real voice. Right. I know it is. I was just saying, you know… So, I am a big fan of your husband, Aurora. Oh, yeah. I feel like you're the second most frequent caller we get. - Besides that one lady. - Someone calls more than I do? [laughs] Actually, I think she might have a little something for you, Hubie. She always dedicates a song to a special someone. Ooh! And we all need that special someone. - Right, baby? - Yes, we do. Oh! Dig in. [both moaning] - A couple days back… - Oh, man. …she had a couple glasses of Chardonnay. Her guard was down, and she asked to dedicate a special song to Hubie. - Chardonnay, eh? - You know what they say about Chardonnay? Truth serum. She said she's gonna show you how much she loves you on Halloween. - Do you think we could trace the number? - I don't need to. Caller ID. 617-555-0968. Sound familiar? No. But there is a number that needs to be dialed immediately. 911! [hooting] [computer beeping] Oh. It's a prepaid phone. - [high-pitched voice] Bitch used a burner. - Mm-hmm. [moaning softly] Any idea of someone who might have a thing for you, or… How would somebody detect such a situation? Anyone in town who seems like they might actually enjoy talking to you. There's one woman, but she's the nicest lady I ever met my life. Well, they all seem nice till they kill you. What's the desperate sicko's name? Um… [whispers] The high school hat trick, Violet Valentine. [laughing] Her? And you? I mean… All right. Let's go see if we can get ourselves a confession. Ooh! This is some Dateline NBC shit. [Hubie] Stormhawk in position and petrified. Over. All right. First of all, we're not gonna use code names. - Okay? - [Hubie] Copy. Did you send backup to my residence to have eyes on my mother? Over. I'm a little short-handed tonight, so I asked Father Dave to keep an eye on her. Negative! Request armed units to that vicinity. Over. Sorry. I can't spare the manpower tonight. Here she comes. Okay, Hubie. It's showtime. Remember, we're lookin' for a confession. But what if I can't get her to confess? Over. If you feel like you've done all you can, or you feel like you're in danger, say the code word. At that point, we'll call the burner phone. If she picks up, we can implicate her that way. And what's the code word again? Over. - You don't have to say over. - [Hubie] Okay. Code word is pumpkin. Roger that. Bogey on my twelve. Three on a match. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. "Smoke 'em if you got..." What the hell is he talking about? I don't know. What'd you ask me out here for, Hubie? What's up? Pumpkin. [groans] - Straight to pumpkin? - Yeah. Pumpkin what? Just pumpkin. Don't kill me. - You gotta be kiddin' me. - Dialing. Hubie. I would never hurt you. Thank you. Pumpkin. Now! Pumpkin. [call ringing] - It's ringing. - Is this a prank? Is there somebody watching us right now? - No one can see us or hear us. - She must not have the phone on her. [heavy breathing] Hello? I just wanted to tell you that I have been in love with you since second grade. - What? - Hello? [whispers] Can you trace it now? [heavy breathing continues] Hubie, I've been in love with you since the first grade. What took you so long? I was in love with our teacher. Miss Glennon? - Wasn't she, like, 70? - I liked the way she smelled. I can't believe this. I can't believe that I spent three years with a self-confident-for-no-reason, bearded, human-ogre when I could have been with you. Ouch. That even hurt me. I'm getting a location. Steve, look at this. - [Steve] Stormhawk, abort! - I thought you were out of my league. - Why? - Stormhawk, repeat, abort! It's the best news I ever heard in my life. Abort. The killer's cell phone is in your house! Mama! No! No way! Lock your doors! Make sure you don't open them! Take care of your children! I'm gonna steal a boat! Mama! I love you! [clock chiming] Oh, no. They got Father Dave. Oh, my God. - Boo! - [screaming] [laughing] Why aren't you watching my mother? The killer's in the house! The killer's in the house! There's no one in the house but her. Hubie? Can you help me down? Ma! Ma! You're okay. Why, yes, Hubie. Why wouldn't I be? Mmm. Oh, no. So, um… Am I your special someone, Mom? Always, Hubie. Mm-hmm. And… today, did you... Did you try to show me just how much you love me? Why, yes, I did, Hubie. I truly did. - [man 1] Hubie! - [woman 1] Hubie! [man 1] Get us out of here! Help! [Landolfa] Hubie, please, get us out of here! [all shouting hysterically] Hubie, there's something wrong with your mom! Come on over here and let me punch your mom in the face! I mean, the good news is you're still alive. I was... Nice observation, toolbox! Now get us out of this! - I'm so sorry. - I tried to explain to you already, Hubie. If you don't fight back, the bullies never stop. So, I had to fight back for you. [Mike] Please, Hubie! Oh, my God! Hubie, that's gas! Mommy, I would've been satisfied if you put itching powder in their sleeping bag. This is extreme. Don't do this to me. Hubie, I'll be your friend forever! [tires screech] [all chattering, shouting] [man] The old lady said they'd be in the backyard. [Tracy] Roll it! Roll it! You don't have to do this. This is too much. We are here and we are live at an unfolding scene of Halloween horror. - [victims shouting, chattering] - [Hubie] Ma. Ma. - Mom, I really don't want you to do this. - I know, Hubie. That's what makes you so wonderful. And that's why I have to do it. I have to make it good for you before I go. Before you go? - To Heaven? - No. Probably going to Hell, Hubie. [sirens wailing] The cops are here! You're goin' to jail, you crazy old bat! - Well, then I better do this now. - [Mr. Hennessy] My God. No, lady. Wait. - [all screaming, shouting] - No! No, no, no, no! - Please don't. - [Landolfa] Hubie, stop her. [voices muted] [distorted, echoing] Help me! - Hubie! - [Hubie screams] [Landolfa laughing] No! [screaming] [echoing] No. [screaming] No! [all laughing maniacally] Always thinking of everyone else, never thinking of yourself. But I guess that's why you're a hero. [Landolfa] Hubie! No! [squeals] - Man. - Freeze, Mrs. Dubois! Hold your fire until my command. Why did we bring them again? There was nobody left at the station. We had to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mommy. This is my fault. - [Mom] That's okay, Hubie. - [Landolfa] Hubie! - Untie us, dummy! - Come on, you stupid dummy! - Untie us, now! - [Mike] Are you paying attention? [Mom] Okay. Wow. Shame on you. Hubie just saved your lives, and you treat him like this. Can one of you tell me why? [Landolfa] Just look at him! He's so… Hubie! [all snickering] Yes, he's Hubie. He's helpful. He's courteous, he's cheerful, he's considerate. What a bad, bad man. My great-great-great-great-great- grandmother laid down her life, trying to save innocent people. I was there. And my son did her one better. He just saved four ungrateful jackasses. Thanks, Pubie. Well, you can't even thank him without insulting him. I'm sorry. I don't know why I said Pubie. It just came out. Could it be because you feel threatened? [stammers] I feel a lot of pressure to be cool all the time. I'm jealous of Hubie being able to be himself. I lost my hair 20 years ago, and every time I walk into a room, I feel silly. Why should someone like Hubie have such a thick, luxuriant head of hair, and I look like a California raisin? I have never felt sexually fulfilled. - But... - Oh, shut up, Lester. You're usually there. You know it's true. I'm guessing… Hubie hasn't had a lot of sex. No, ma'am. Hasn't had any sex. Mmm. But what he does have is hope. Damn him and his hope! I was diagnosed with dyslexia in the eighth grade. I faked it for the doctors, but I'm really just dumb. I never really told anybody. You're probably all surprised. - No, I'm not surprised. - Nope. - You surprised? - [laughs] No. But Hubie uses big words, and they come out so natural for him. It pisses me off. Oh, 'cause of the dumb thing. My brother-in-law once said that I had no ambition. And then he bit me, and I became a werewolf. [howls softly] You see? Hubie's smart, has nice hair, and sex hope. But to me, his best quality is this. He can weather all of your insults and your thrown objects, and he responds with humor and... and kindness. Could you say the same? Could any of you take the abuse you dish out to my Hubie? I busted a guy for DWI last week, and, uh… He said it was an honor to be arrested by a Muppet. I acted like I didn't hear him. But then I cried in my squad car for about half an hour. You see, Hubie. True bravery's being kind. Even to those who are being cruel to you. I just always wanted to be as nice as you, Mom. Oh, you were nicer. But now I know that you're ready to spread your wings and fly without me. You don't have to be scared anymore. I'm feeling emotional. - And a little horny. - Ooh! - Not for you. - Oh. Just know that I'll always love you. And happy Halloween. Frankenstein! [all] Where? [Mom cackling maniacally] We fell for that twice in one night. We gotta try that with the orderlies when we get back. - Okay. - It's such a… [laughing] Hubie! The blood. It's going to my... - [police radios chattering] - [cutting] Happy Halloween. One thing I still don't get. Why did his mom have to kill Peanut the pig? That was me, actually. I had a case of the late-night munchies. All right, we gotta get these guys back to the mental institution. This has been a magical night in Salem, Massachusetts. - Excuse me. May I say something? - [Tracy] Yes. Please, go ahead. Hubie. I just wanna say happy Halloween to everybody in Salem. Also, happy Valentine's Day. I'm talking to you, Violet Valentine. [gasps] Also… I just broke up with my Canadian girlfriend. So, I am available. - Oh, my God. - Miss Valentine, this is for you. Hubie, do be mine. Mmm… [both moaning] [Hubie] Yummy. Muah! Muah! [both moaning] Can you guys stop kissing and check out our costumes? Yes, of course. Come on. - Show us what you've got. - Please. Let's see it. Oh, my God. Oh, well, look at this. I cannot believe we have this. Father Dave. My childhood friend, Richie Hartman. - Is that Officer Steve? - [Violet] Yeah. And the one and only Mr. Walter Lambert. [kids howling] [Hubie] How did you do this? [Steve] Oh! Terrific costumes, guys. Especially yours, Cooky. I like it. What are you? A Muppet, right? Yeah, sure. - Our kids are so creative. - They are amazing. Mmm! You never kissed me like that, Violet. I know. - Yeah, well… - Dad, don't forget your sash. Okay, yes. Would you put it on me, please? That's right. Thank you, Danielle and everybody. I'll see you at the apple-bobbing contest at ten o'clock tonight. Oh, and you two. You guys are gonna be hittin' the parties later, - so I made these for you. - [clicks] That's some matzo ball soup, also with a flare gun. Uh… - [glass shattering] - [cat howls] You suck! Sorry about that! - Thanks, Dad. - Yeah, of course. And this is chicken gumbo with a hair dryer. [air blowing] [sighs] Wow, that is badass. All right, guys. Take care. I'll miss you. - Mr. Mayor Dubois, let's get you downtown. - [car starts] - Bye! - Love you, Daddy! Bye! We love you. We'll see you later! [Hubie] Bye, guys! Bye-bye! Hey, Hubie! You're the man! Thanks. I learned it all from my mother, who's right behind you. - [all gasp] - Got you, O'Doyle! - [kids laugh] - Happy Halloween! Happy Halloween to all! And to all, a good fright! [Aurora in high-pitched voice] And so, another Halloween has come to Salem. So, you best take the advice of our beloved Mayor and frequent caller, Hubie Dubois. And have a safe and fun time. [Aurora's wife in deep voice] Hang on, baby. Got some spaghetti and meatballs for ya. [Aurora in deep voice] Okay. Let's Lady and the Tramp that shit.
