THE ORGANIZER TURIN - THE LATE 1800s Omero. Wake up. It's 5:30. Wash well, you hear? Your neck and ears too. Come on, lazybones. The milk needs heating. You haven't got the coal burning yet. The coal's wet. It's so damp in here. The coalman's dog pisses on the coal! Watch your mouth! Hey, wake up! Leave him alone. His stomach hurt last night. - He just hates schoolwork. - That's not true! Oh, yeah? Maybe I can't read, but I know my numbers, and this is a big fat zero. Omero, leave money for groceries. Again? The week isn't even half over. This is the last of it, so go easy. "Go easy." Easy for you to say. Your lunch. Did you wash? Morning. Wake up, dummy! Take it easy! - Same spot today? - I'm coming. Hold your horses. Don't ever call me "dummy" again, you hear? I'll call you anything I want as long as I'm bigger than you. So much for talking things over. Rice and turnips again. It's good for you. Nusetta, here I am! Some idea, bringing the baby here in this cold! He's asleep when I leave and when I get home. I've got a right to see him. Hey, small-fry! Look at Papa. See that? He doesn't even know me. That'll teach you, you pig! Nice manners. They don't even give you time to eat. Here, take this. Come on, Pautasso. You're always the last. Did you have enough time to eat? These cannibals wolf it down without even chewing. Come on, get moving! The bastards treat us like animals! It's worse than prison. To hell with all of 'em. My arm! Stop the machines! Stop the wheel! Stand back! Let me through! How is he? How do you think? Hands don't grow back. We're taking up a collection for Mondino. Another collection. Ls that all we can do? Raoul's right. Can't you even do that for the poor man? What kind of animals are you? I'll tell you! We work a 14-hour shift with half an hour to eat. Then something like this happens. Do we ask for more reasonable shifts? No, we can't take any risks! We take up a collection! Right, Pautasso? Cenerone? Sheep - that's what we are! What do you mean, asking me? I'm always ready. Don't believe it? Maybe a knuckle sandwich will convince you. Papa, calm down. Words don't put food on the table. Will Mondino get by on our collection? What a laugh! We don't even have accident insurance. And I'm the one talking nonsense? Martinetti, you didn't answer. I said I'm ready. - To do what? - To give the boss an earful. About what? I don't know. Anything you want. I'll raise a stink! To tell him 14 hours a day is too much. Right! They have to cut the hours, or - We'll form a committee to decide who'll speak to them. Good. I'll be the leader. - No, we're all equal. You, him - - And me! Women too now? Look, this is serious. Oh, so we can work and contribute to collections, but not stand up for our rights? Quiet! Go home now. It's late. Forgive us, Sister. Home to bed now, or tomorrow you won't even get your drawers on straight. Your father's quite a guy, eh? He produced a juicy tidbit like you. Animal! Dinner's ready for Ward 3. Soup with meat and potatoes. Hey, the umbrella! Wait for me! - We should turn back for you? - What cavaliers! To hell with your cavaliers. - Who's gonna do the talking? - All of us. - Like an opera chorus? - I'm no talker. Martinetti. Scram! All right, I'll do it. - Where are you going? - We wanted to speak to the manager. Good-bye, Mr. Baudet. The manager? What do you want with him? - We want to tell him something. - Tell me. It's just that - - Is it a secret? - On the contrary. We speak for everyone. It's about the accident yesterday. Fourteen hours a day is too much. You're really lucky, you know? If you'd said that to the boss, you'd all be finished. Everybody in Turin works the same hours. That's why these accidents happen. My good man, accidents are accidental. You have to be careful and hope they don't happen. You're not going to blame the manager, are you? See you later, Baudet. Enjoy your lunch, sir. Listen. I'm on salary, just like you. I'm on your side. I mean this sincerely: Come back down to earth and forget this nonsense. Where did you ever get such crazy ideas? Go on. Speak up. They're not crazy ideas. What's crazy is exploiting people. - Right. - That's it. Am I wrong? Here. Write your name and fold it up tight. Hold your horses. I'll be back. He's in there. Another collection? - You putting your name in? - For what? We're quitting early tonight. - The manager agreed? - Yeah, and pigs fly too. No, we're taking matters into our own hands. We're demonstrating, like the British. Bend over. What are the names for? Just stay there. To decide who'll blow the whistle an hour early so we all stop at the same time. Are you in? Yeah, but the whistle-blower's taking a big chance. As soon as you hear the whistle, shut off the steam. The machines will stop, and everyone will have to quit. - Don't worry. - Let's have the names. I can't read. Just great. Here, you read it. This guy can't write. Who put an X? Me too. Forget all this. I'll do it. Watch out! What's going on here? Back to work, all of you! We stop at 7:30. Spread the word. When the machines stop, we all leave. Foreman! I gotta go. Go away! Beat it, mutt! - Hey! - Ready! Hey, you! Yeah, I'm ready! Hey, you lucky devils! You're nice and warm in here when it's freezing outside! And you'd still rather go home earlier? What's going on? You sure that's our whistle? Don't shut the steam off! Don't stop the machines! - Come on. - No one's moving! Didn't you hear the whistle? Let's go! Keep working! There's still an hour to go. - Something went wrong. Hey! Why have you got your coat on? I'm cold. We really came through for Pautasso. Who sounded the whistle? What kind of joke is this? What are you doing here? Playing with the dog. He's been in there an hour and a half. Here he comes! Did they give him the third degree? Let me shake your hand for being the only one - Stop it! Stop the brute! Damned fool! Stop it! That's enough! Pautasso, listen! You're right, but let us talk! No, I'll do the talking now! Some friends you are! You left me high and dry. I had to pretend I was drunk. "Pautasso, have you been drinking?" "Afraid so, sir. For my rheumatism." You make me sick! We'll get better organized. We'll form a committee, and you'll be on it. Tomorrow we'll decide. They've already done the deciding! Two weeks' suspension for me, and a fine for everybody. The crooks! Now let me go! Let him go on three. One, two, three! Listen carefully, all of you. Forget Domenico Pautasso exists. Cross my name off your list! We'll make up your lost pay. But we must remain united! Sure, like my balls! Foul-mouthed pig! Learn some manners! Papa, stop it! You old walrus, let's go! Take that, bastard! Let me go! Bastards! Murderers! You animal! Hit me and I'll kill you! Excuse me. What town is this? A shithole of a town! That's how you answer a stranger? This is the Porta Susa district of Turin. - Porta Susa? Thank you. In "The rose smells sweet," the subject is "the rose." In "The butterfly is graceful," the subject is - The butterfly! "The nightingale -" The others have been here half an hour! Sorry, sir. We're late. I hadn't noticed! I could have been home snug in bed by now! I'm here for your good, not mine! Let's get this straight right now. To vote you must be able to write. That's the law laid down by our beloved government. On these crude benches is where you earn the right to make your voice heard in parliament. This classroom is where your brains will find new power and strength to nourish the flame of a faith that will shine ever brighter and with which we must - Anyway... forget I said anything. Mr. Di Meo, sir, we demonstrated to leave work an hour early. - But you're an hour late. - Lt didn't go so well. Barbero... go to the blackboard. What am I supposed to do? Write anything, whatever comes to mind. Go ahead. I'll be right back. Copy down what Barbero writes. I came along with my father, sir. Fine, go in. We never close. We live so far away. How's he doing? What can I say? Not very well. He won't apply himself. But he's no trouble. He just sleeps. Don't get me wrong. He's very smart. - Yes? - Good evening. I'm Professor Giuseppe Sinigaglia. Attorney Pancani in Genoa sent me. - Attorney Pancani? - Yes, sir. This letter's for you. - So there's trouble there too. - At least for me. - You'll be staying here a few days. - Exactly. After class I'll see about putting you up. Nothing deluxe. - Very kind of you. DEATH TO THE KING Barbero, what's that you wrote? This is what you came up with? Look, boys, I share your sentiments, but you must realize that becoming educated is also about acquiring discipline and self-control! Let's keep the racket down. Quiet! Bardella Carlini here is taking Pautasso's place on the committee. Pautasso didn't show up. Go ahead. Anyone want to say something? Go ahead. Shit, I didn't get a damned word of that. Such language! It's Bergamo dialect. My poor father was from there too. He suggests that instead of quitting an hour early, we all agree to start an hour later tomorrow morning. Hey, easy! Hurray for Pautasso! All right, that's enough. Raoul Bertone has the floor. I wonder if you learned from yesterday's fiasco. Think carefully before you try anything stupid again. That's enough! I've got the floor now. - Why? Because I'm on the committee, and you're a dope. End of discussion. Excuse me. There's some truth to what the young man said. - Who's this guy? - I don't know. I am Professor Sinigaglia, a guest of Mr. Di Meo. May I speak? Let's hear what you have to say. Thank you, and please forgive the intrusion. What I wanted to say is just this: One should indeed think twice before inciting any action. The young man was right on this point. Wait, you big ape! Go on. There's no doubt you've accomplished the most important thing: Near total unanimity of intention. And I know how difficult it is to gather so many workers outside the workplace. That's why I thought it would be a pity to let such an occasion be wasted in discussing a mere hour of work. Think about it. I say not just an hour, but a whole day, a whole week, until your bosses realize they're dealing with men, not pack animals! But that would be a strike. Would it? Perhaps. That's a strike, all right. Friends, let's go on strike! Whoever doesn't join us is a bastard! Just a moment, please. There must be freedom of choice. If the young man is afraid, he needn't join. No one's afraid here, see? Afraid you'll all shit your pants when it comes down to it, maybe! Who is this guy anyway? I have years of experience in these matters. It was just a suggestion. Show of hands for a full strike! Approved "humanimously," except for Raoul Bertone. I'm with you. Speak up! - He said he's with us. - That's more like it. Just a moment, please! May I further suggest you act with discretion and not let word get out until you've laid in groceries, coal, as many provisions as possible - on credit! Don't pay for any of it! Just a moment. Because you must be able to hold out as long as possible. Tomorrow, when people find out you're on strike, all credit will stop. They'll slam the door in your face. You should know that right now. Today's Sunday, and the stores close at noon! Don't breathe a word of this Or you'll weaken, my blond beauty I'll take you for a holiday By the lake or by the sea Tighten your belt and don't give an inch Tighten your belt and wave our banner high Tighten your belt We'll march by the hundreds Whoever backs down now is a traitor Excuse me, Professor. I forgot my - Please. Adele, how about coming to my place and cooking us a big dinner? Take a hike! You've got me wrong, as usual. I live alone. Really? You can always find that type of girl. Ask Maria over there. I see. You're jealous. I'll tell Maria what you said. You do that! Hey, baby doll, give me a hand. - What a haul! - I racked up five lire in credit! Coming through! I'll pay you tomorrow. My hands are full. Hey, is it true that tomorrow you're all going on - Watch it! Is it true that tomorrow - Right in my face! - Outside! Excuse me. Evening. She didn't see me, did she? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a streetwalker. Quick, then. Come inside and you'll be safe. To help Italy get better Italy is ailing And full of woes To help Italy get better Give her all you've got Scoundrel! Let me out! - Are you crazy? - Go to hell! Who do you think I am? You and the bearded man are pigs! - What bearded man? - Pig! Damn it all! Good evening. - What are you doing here? - Drying my feet. Ls this your place? The committee assigned me to this apartment. They've kindly appointed me their adviser, so I'll have to stay in town a few days. You think this is a hotel? Get your shoes on and scram! Easy, fruitcake. It's been decided and that's that, see? Not unless you're paying the rent! Nice way to talk! We have to stick together, don't we? You're the only single person with a double bed. - Cesarina here is single too. - Some gentleman! - A man like him would do you good! - Selfish bastard! Stop this nonsense, for God's sake! Professor, I've put your things here in this hat, because your basket fell out in the street. My toiletry kit! Everything fell out, but I picked it all up. A darning egg, soap - Is this your soap? - Yes, thanks. A sock. A brush. Ls this yours too? - These little tubes. - That's my piccolo. What's a piccolo? A musical instrument of the early 18th century. Really? Imagine that. And here's your horseshoe, Professor. Ls this yours? - No, not that. I told you to leave it on the ground. I carried it all this way! Wait, we have to ward off bad luck. And make sure we get our rights! And make sure the manager drops dead! Now toss it out the window! You hit someone. Right on my head, you shitheads! Who's this Mustafa! With all due respect, I'm reporting for work tomorrow. Who are you? A desperate man. I'm new in town. I can't get credit, and I've got a family. We've all got families. You northerners don't think much of us Sicilians, I know. - You would defy the committee? - No, sir. I came for your authorization. That way I won't be defying anyone. What's he ranting about? If you work, you'll undermine our solidarity! Idiot, we all voted! Then vote again. But think it over, because I'm going to work in any case. My respects, Professor. Stop! Didn't you hear? This is crazy! Some people! If that Ethiopian goes to work tomorrow, one by one they'll all go back, with yours truly first in line! Stop yammering. We need concrete suggestions. If you're serious, you'll give that Sicilian a good thrashing. Teach him a lesson. If you're serious. Heaven help us. What a sad world this is. A poor devil leaves his native village with his starving family in search of work. He finds it. And what do we do? We snatch it from him and leave him in the darkest despair. Does that seem right to you? Let's give him his lesson. How? Friends, unfortunately Raoul is right. If we indulge in false sentiment now, it's all over. You want that, Pautasso? - I'm Cesarina! I'm Pautasso, and any scabs will have to fight me first! No mercy! We can't afford mercy. This is where you live? Did you expect a royal palace? Salvatore, what do they want? Have you come to give me what I asked for? Swear you won't work if we don't authorize it. Are you gonna authorize it? Swear first. I swear, Mr. Pautasso. All right. Go ahead. If 13 hours Don't seem much to you You try working them They seem serious, eh? This is the end of the world. I've been here 12 years, and I never expected this from them. I'll reduce their hours all right! What do you plan to do? - If they don't block entry, nothing. Some protection you are! One of them's coming this way. Hey, you! Don't you know there's a strike on? I've got the committee's permission. Hey, Bedouin! Stop him! They're quarreling amongst themselves. Good. if one comes to work, it's a good sign. - Why's he get special treatment? - Are we dumber than that Arab? Let's all go in. We'll call the others. Salvatore Arr? reporting for work, sir. They can start the machines. I'm ready. To work all alone? What do the others plan to do? That's secret information that I don't have. You're defending those carrion? They can't be that bad if they gave me permission to come to work. Ah, so they gave you permission? Yes, sir. Then you can leave too. I'm reporting for work, and I'm not leaving. Beat it! Didn't you hear the gentleman? Don't you dare touch me! I told you why I'm here, didn't I? Filthy procurer! Damned be the blood of Judas and your kind! Help! He's got a knife! He's gonna kill us! Have you lost your mind? You'll be sorry for this! Get him! - Careful, now! - Stop him! - Does the Arr? family live here? - Yes. Why? - What's making all that smoke? - Wet paper. What is it? - I'm from the factory. We took up a collection. It's not much, 'cause we're on strike. - Mama! - What is it? - They brought money! - Who? A boy from the factory. May the blessed Mother of God protect your father, the poor sinner! Greetings, everyone. Hello. Carry on, gentlemen. Be seated. - I was saying, Uncle - - Speak up! We can assume the workers won't be able to hold out much longer - Meanwhile our losses from unfilled orders are piling up. Did I say you could smoke? Everyone helps them: the troops, social service societies. But that's charity. You've been living off my charity for 20 years! Wake up, all of you! If they have friends, so do we - and ours are more powerful. We'll cut off their supplies, block the streets, until they know who's calling the tune. Then they'll be ready to talk. Now go learn your business, blockheads! Enough. Today's a holiday, and we've talked shop long enough. Let's join the young people and enjoy ourselves. Would you like to come along? - Very kind of you. Stop. No, you're not properly dressed. Giovanni will see you out. Good-bye now. Where's this free coal you mentioned? It's my little secret. Don't worry. - Is it far? - Just follow me. What was your name again? - Gesummina. - What kind of name is that? - It's Jesus's name. - Jesus was a man. He wasn't a man or a woman, dummy. He was above everyone. You're from those dark lands. Talk about dark. The sun never shines here. There everything is green, white, and red. Out of the way, Omero! Why'd you come up here? All our troubles here in Piedmont started when you Sicilians came. My father says they started in Sicily when you Piedmontese arrived. Coal coming over! Some secret. Look at all these people. Ls my old man on the other side? I don't know. - Watch out over there! - Make way! That's my pop! That's our stuff, you hear? I'll give him a hand. Help me up. Push! - You're heavy! Come on! Good girl! Give us a hand! Want some help? That wall's high. You might land on something hard. Stupid idiot! Raoul! Let go. You're nuts! You insult me, then call me over, and then slap me! You can get lost! What are you doing over there? Give me a hand. Come on, baby doll. Step lively! Isn't there a watchman around? Don't worry. The professor's chatting with him. Railway tie coming over! Watch your noggins! Why don't you do the same? You railway employees are a strong group. Show your solidarity with the strikers and go out on strike yourselves! You never let that tongue of yours cool down. Railway employees can't budge. If we strike, they send in troops, and we're jailed as deserters. So you just sit back and watch. No one's watching anything. Your friends are stealing coal, but I don't see a thing. Some of you are getting in line twice. You better watch out. I know all your faces. Next. What is this, a restaurant? That's enough, Corporal! Captain's orders! The sergeant's a bastard! Go fuck yourselves! To hell with soldiers! I hope you choke on your god-damned soup! Miss! The corporal sent me. This soup is for you. Your bowl's inside. Thank God. And some bread too. No, that one's mine. I already took a bite, see? How come you're all so skinny? This strike will be the death of us. Typhus killed five people in my hometown last summer. A strike isn't a disease! There's even some left for tomorrow. Thanks again. Careful. It's hot. Good soup! Thank God for our soldiers. The professor would let us all starve. The professor's a great man. He gives us advice. I think he's a swindler - and a stupid one. You're the stupid one. The soup tastes better here than at the barracks. Maybe it's the dishes... or this house. My house is just like this. - Imagine that. The window's open. The smell will bring them around like flies. Too late. So much for leftovers. Oh, you're eating. Pardon me. Must be hot where you come from. You're from Naples, right? No, Abruzzo. We get snow six feet high. And wolves too. - "Wolves" - what's that? - Plural of "wolf." That's mine! Always in other people's pockets! Who paid for it, and everything else since you went on strike? To think we farmers always say that you factory workers are the lucky ones. Got a match? - Never use 'em. Like my grandfather. He chews his cigars. If you spit, you'll clean it up. - Got anything to drink? - Water and vinegar. Better than nothing. Nice soft doublets they give you now. In my time they felt like nettles. Very nice. - You like it? I'll see if the quartermaster can get you one. He's a friend of mine. I wear a size 12 shoe. That fellow from Bergamo! Pautasso! What the hell are you saying? Who wants to talk? The bosses called the committee! They're giving in! My regards! "First: A 13-hour shift, with an hour for lunch." Write that down. "Second: Repeal the disciplinary action against Pautasso. Third: Repeal the fines imposed on the workers at large, etc. Fourth, fifth and sixth: Five minutes' grace time in the morning, strike pay, and accident insurance. Seventh -" Is something wrong? How about coffee and pastries too? Aren't we going a bit far? What do you mean? You think it's too much? It's not small change. For God's sake! Are the bosses surrendering or not? It's absolutely unprecedented in this stronghold of conservatism! Woe to the vanquished! Like Brenno, whom history has deemed an oppressor and yet - Fine. You talk and I'll write. Workers injured on the job - What? I should come here in secret to avoid upsetting my blockhead of a father? Don't shout! I'm shouting so he'll hear me! For the last time, don't ever set foot in my house again! Who do you think you are? You can croak for all I care. I came to see Mama, you hear? Since you're so ashamed of me in front of these imbeciles. Yes, I take any man who pays, and anyone who's interested can find me at the Caff? Corsini on the piazza. Get out of here! - Giulio! - Forget about him! The bosses are probably waiting. Excuse my saying this - No, Cesarina, family matters are private. It's just good manners. - Good manners say ladies go first. Easy, friends. Don't hurry. Let the bosses wait. Come in. About time. It's been an hour. Who's going in first? Excuse us. Well? Come in! Don't be shy. Sorry for the short delay. I was busy. So... these are our agitators. You don't have bombs in your pockets, do you? Let's introduce this distinguished delegation. This is Martinetti, and the others are Porro, Camerone, and - No need to introduce her! This is the lovely Cesarina! Remember when you first came to the factory in '71? I'd have liked to give you a good pinch. We saw to that ourselves, sir. And aren't you the one who likes the bottle? Now I see why they call you people "Reds." Mind you: I like that kind of red too. We're not Reds, sir. I know. You're all hard workers. Doing work that has its compensations, even if it's a bit hard. "Man is the only animal that has to work," said that philosopher, what's-his-name. Well, I'm one of those animals too. But you feel things would be better if we were a bit more indulgent. Gentlemen, shall we rescind the fines on these rascals? - If you think so. - Let's rescind them. As for our whistle-blower, we abolish his suspension and end the whole matter. Satisfied? Sir, allow me to speak to you man-to-man. We can't go back to our colleagues with a mere consolation prize. Look here. If you call my offer a consolation prize, this becomes a whole other matter. I know what's happened. You've let that vagrant get you stirred up. He's a rabble-rouser and a fugitive from justice! That's not true, sir. Look, you whiners, you know how many are unemployed around here? Skilled workers like you, willing to work this minute, under worse conditions. In Saluzzo, 200 factory workers are out on the street. I'm willing to let bygones be bygones, but I need an answer by tomorrow. Otherwise, I too have interests to look out for. And the unemployed from Saluzzo will be on the next train here. Pautasso! Come on out here! The bosses have called in the scabs! - Scabs? Where are they? - They're coming from Saluzzo! Goddamn it! Where are you going in your drawers, you lunkhead? Fine results you got, you dopes! He calls himself a leader! Uncle, did you hear what Pop did? You should be ashamed! No! Where are you going? Leave that here, you idiot! Pautasso, we'll stop 'em at the freight yard! Go get the professor! Adele, my jacket! Cesarina, climb up out of the way. This could get dangerous. Dangerous? Why? We've got to talk to them and convince them. They're just like us. What have you got here? What's this? For self-defense. That hurt, damn it! "Talk to them"! We'll see if yakking changes their minds. We didn't ask you to come, Mr. Doomsayer. Fine. Pretend I'm not here. Here they come. Off the tracks! Out of the way, you bums! Are you crazy? Out of the way! Friends! Fellow workers from Saluzzo! We have nothing against you. Listen to us. We're the striking workers. - Who's this lunatic? Just a moment, please! Hear me out! We've been forced to strike for our rights. That's why these people are sacrificing, starving - We're starving too. We haven't worked in a month. I understand. That's just what the bosses seek to exploit. Don't play their game! So we all starve together? Who gains from that? Wait! Start the train! They're trying to keep us out! Where are you going? Beat it, preacher! Friends! Why are you doing this? Gang up on one guy, will you? Unhook it, quick! Get down here, you bastard! Come down off that train! Get out of here, you bum! Take that! You rat! Let's discuss this rationally! Let's talk it over! No, stop! Where's the switch? I'll divert it to the sidetrack. The express is coming! Come back, Pautasso! Pautasso! Just then, the express was arriving - We're from the gas works. Who do we give this to? Cesarina's handling the collection. It's all we could manage. Thanks all the same. A drop in the ocean. After all this, we at the munitions works better tread cautiously. I agree. We probably should never have - - He's right. - Who? Martinetti. There's been nothing but trouble since that professor showed up. And now the workers from Saluzzo have taken your jobs. Idiot. You don't understand anything. We can hardly get by, even with the soup from the barracks. I'm thinking of cutting my hair for a little money. - Your hair? - They pay well for it. For those fake things for women's heads. The word's on the tip of my tongue. - And then what? - What do you mean? You'll be cute with your head shaved. What do you care? Antonio didn't say anything. What's he got to do with it? It's just that... we're engaged. - He's not much to look at. - You don't have to think so. They're pinning it all on the strikers, but it's not true. Are you having a mass said for him? There's something I've tried so often to tell you, but I always chose the wrong words... and now I've chosen the wrong moment. Say it anyway. Gentlemen! Why all the long faces? Haven't you seen the paper? The bosses are taking a beating over this. Listen. "Factory manager being held." - What's that mean? The scabs are being sent back to Saluzzo to prevent further incidents. I told you something would happen if we held out. Sure, a man lost his life. Happy now? How many more do you want? What are you doing? Shove your paper in my face again and I'll smash your snout in! Sure, you've got the muscle for it, but you got any ideas in that brain of yours? That's all you care about - your stupid ideas. You're not here to help us. We're dumb animals with no ideas, eh? Why should you care about us? You're being foolish and unfair. Then tell me the truth. Can we really pull this off? Look at me, damn it! There's only a handful of us. We're divided and discouraged. They're powerful, well-connected, sure of themselves. So I don't know. It might even be impossible. Then you're a lunatic and a scoundrel! You want to destroy us all? You expect to win the first time? That doesn't happen! That would be too easy. And you're not the first, you know. This fight began with Spartacus! - Who's Spartacus? I'll tell you some other time. But you have to hold out and make them pay so they know that next time it'll be even worse. That in itself would be a victory! And don't hog the covers! But we take all the risks, right? What do you care? You're not one of us. You'll vanish one day just as suddenly as you appeared. You're right. I'm not like you. I have no home, no family, no friends. No one's interested in me except the police. Then why are you doing this? Why? Because I'm full of foolish ideas. Good boy, Quinterio. Fagiolini, my regards to your father. No, Pierino, not you. This is from grades 1, 2 and 3. Miss Spirinbergo refused, of course. Thank you. - Di Meo. - Good morning, sir. I spoke to you yesterday about a complaint from the school board, and I was very civil, you must admit. One can be decent without being a socialist. Yet despite my explicit order to the contrary, you organized yet another collection. I'm the assistant principal! You're a spy! What are you doing? - Returning this to the children. Hands off! I said hands off! Teach your pupils good citizenship - period! You weren't hired to engage in subversive activity! Subversive activity! It's a simple act of compassion for a deceased worker. It's a wonderful lesson for the children! Don't shout at me! We should just keep teaching them about tyranny and servitude! Enough! I'm going to report you! Fine! I'll write the report myself, so it's not full of stupid mistakes! Pompous ass! Good morning, sir. Tell your friends there'll be no more collections at school. I'm sorry. Sir, how's my little brother here doing? He's not stupid. But he doesn't study, so he's not doing well. Tell your mother to keep after him. You have to study, you hear? I don't like school! I want to work in the factory like you! You're gonna graduate, you hear me? I'll kill you before I let you do like I did! Blow. Lazy bums! Good-for-nothings! - What's your excuse? - Mr. Luigi! Must I notify you when I'm coming so you'll be on the job? - But the strike - - Am I paying you or not? Then you have a duty here, strike or no strike! That goes for you too! Go to hell! Look at these figures. I did more in half a day than you do in a month! In four weeks we haven't billed a cent. Our clients are ordering their goods elsewhere. Here, read! The time's come for action! No more excuses! We've taken steps in several directions. Even the textile union voted to - I don't care! These people will stick it out as long as that meddler's here. You there - earn your salary. Notify the police that the public safety is threatened. That bum of a professor has a record. Why don't they arrest him? Maybe you're right. No maybes. Otherwise we'll have to give them everything they want! Carlo. Either we get rid of that professor or we throw in the towel. It's just the right temperature. - Some chicken? - No, I hate chicken. But you like me, eh? Come on. Just a bit. - Who's that? - I know that man. That's not allowed here. Give me something for that man. Two lire! Who is he - Verdi? Please leave. Hey, wait! Here. Do you work at the factory? - No, I'm a professor. - Professor of - - No, a high-school professor. - Then excuse me for giving you - - Charity? That's what I was playing for. Then you're not like that starving crusader. Who? I know so many. He's ashamed of my money. Says he earns his by honest work. - Who? My father. He says I should work in the spinning mill, my hands in water 16 hours a day, and end up in the hospital like all those other idiots. So I changed jobs. Did I harm anyone? Did I? You did just fine. You mean it? Of course. As you see, I changed jobs too. How'd you get messed up in all this? - Out of selfishness. - I don't understand. Because I like it, and when you like something, it's not a sacrifice. And to ensure that someday a girl like you... won't have to make the choice you had to. Transferred to Cassino? I guess I was too much for the principal. On the anniversary of Garibaldi's death, for instance - Are any of our men there? I can leave you his address. Please do. There's pen and paper there. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Food for your journey. No, I'd be taking it right out of your mouth. No, not out of mine. Why do we do all this? Maybe we're out of our minds after all. Professor Sinigaglia? He's not in. And who might you be? Who are you? Raoul Bertone. The professor's my guest. Why? - When's he due back? - I don't know. Fine. We'll wait. - Police? - Headquarters. Good Lord! What's the professor done? Don't worry. It's just my darning egg. Nippy, isn't it? - There's nothing on it. - Why'd you throw it away? - I've got too many papers. - Don't move! You there. Are you Professor Sinigaglia? - What? I don't understand. Who are you? We're from police headquarters. Your papers. Stop! Good evening. Why are you dressed like that in this cold? I left in a bit of a hurry. You'll catch bronchitis in a hurry too. Please sit down. - Sit down? Thank you. I'm so sorry. Please, another for the lady. - Don't bother. No, please. I'll have this one. You're very kind. Anyway, bronchitis is better than jail. I'm innocent, mind you, but we drive them crazy, so they hound us. - Where were you headed? - Nowhere special. I didn't want to put my friends at risk. Don't you have family? A wife and two children. But my wife and I didn't get along - my fault, to be sure. I lead a rather chaotic life. They're better-off with my father-in-law. The old owl's rich, but he's a good type. And teaching was a bore anyway. I should have a picture of the little devils somewhere. Of course, they must be young men by now. - And this? - You like it? It's yours. Ah, here it is. I'm coming. I'm afraid... it's a bit tattered. - Handsome, aren't they? - They're good boys. I'm coming! My glove. - Sorry. Listen, Professor, go sleep at my place tonight. Portici Cavour No. 4, second floor. No, I couldn't take advantage of your kindness. Don't worry about that. I'll see you later. Since you're so kind, would you deliver a message for me? Certainly. To whom? Raoul Bertone. Via Caval di Ferro No. 18. Tell him they must hold out, that we're going to win. Thank you so much. Bruna, put it all on my bill. Very well. - Who's that? - A most exceptional character. Really? With an exceptional appetite. Who's there? Excuse me. No, excuse me. Ah, you brought my things. - I hope it's all there. I'm sure it is. A lovely girl named Adele gave them to me. Ah, Raoul's girlfriend. - He's at her house. - Her house? Why? They questioned him for hours. They did, huh? And then? When they released him, he decided to relocate too. Damn! I'm sorry. The poor fellow. Did they rough him up? Not at all. As for you being hounded, Professor, you're also wanted for wounding a policeman in Genoa. I know. But they can't touch me. It was self-defense. Just what were you up to? You asleep in there? I asked what you were up to in Genoa. Sorry. Genoa, you say? Nothing really. I was crossing the piazza when the police stopped us. Stopped "us"? So you weren't alone. No, there were 300 of us. There were 300 of you? Why not just come out and say it was a demonstration! Ls that against the law? All right, all right. Looks like you'll be hiding out here a while. Are you kidding? I have to set an example. If I show I'm afraid, the strike will falter. It's the factory owners who are faltering. Seriously? I've been told they'll cave in before you do. How do you know? Mr. Baudet is my girlfriend's client. Really? Please thank her for this welcome news that confirms all my theories, as I've tried to - We'll discuss all that tomorrow. It's late. Good night. Would you please close the window? Good night. If you'll clean up a bit first, there's room for you here. I'm coming! Don't bother, Rosa. I'll get it. Good old Martinetti. How are you? I thought of having the shop fix my old stove, but then I remembered that you fixed it for me once. And you'll do a better job anyway. Come on in. There's the old piece of junk. I'd appreciate it if the others didn't hear about this, sir. Why should they care? The strike is the bosses' affair. I'm on salary like you. Go on. Rosa, two cups of coffee. So... how are things going, Martinetti? You know, after this long strike... maybe it's time to take stock, eh? Let's not discuss that, please. I only came for the money, for my wife's sake. - What's wrong with her? - She's pregnant. She has kidney trouble, a high fever, and other stuff. She should be in the hospital. - Really? Much more of this and we'll all end up there. Your stove is fine. Look, I know Professor Spaziani at the gynecological clinic. I could talk to him. - Thank you. I'm your friend. You know that. Then couldn't you help us with the bosses? Convince them to give in just a little. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but we can't hold out much longer. Set that here. No, no, run along. Make yourself comfortable. It's too bad, but the bosses can hold out for years. Just last night the old man told me he'll never give in. It's a matter of principle with him. Besides, you've shown your strength now. So take a tip from me and play it smart. Give in first to show you're coming from a position of strength. They'll show their appreciation. Striking for 31 days is already something. We've shown the bosses we have the upper hand. Now that they know that, we should play it smart and make the first move, because it's a matter of principle with them. They can hold out for years. So you're saying we should back down? Back down? I'm just saying that, for better or worse... since we're still united, we can go back with heads held high and - Is it true there's a general meeting later? That's what we decided. To decide whether to go back to work. You didn't consult with the professor? The professor! We're not married to the man. We've listened to him for weeks. Friends, you know me. I was the first to act while you were all still asleep, and now I say let's go back to work. They're not monsters. They have families too. They have wives and children. Tell me: Did they pay you to spout this crap? Raoul, no insults here. You can speak your piece at the meeting. Omero! Professor! It's Omero! What is it? Raoul says to come quickly! They want to go back to work! Goddamn it! What's going on? What are you doing? - I have to go. - They'll arrest you! They'll arrest you! - Probably. In fact, almost certainly. I have to go. Just like that? Without a word? Don't ever come back! Look at that oaf! I don't ever want to see him again, dead or alive! Scoundrel! You'll end up in the hospital, not jail! At least put this on, you stubborn fool! Looks to me like the majority want to go back to work. Let's take a count. - Can't you see? - A count? What's to count? Isn't it obvious? It's an important decision. I want a count. All right. We'll do it the other way. Hands down. Those in favor of continuing the strike, hands up. Satisfied? Count them. Forgive me. In my rush I forgot my glasses. But even if I can't see you clearly, I know all the same who voted to keep up the fight. Barbero? Yes, Professor. Now and forever! Good. I knew it. Gallesio! I won't back down! Bardella. Isn't Bardella here? I'm right here. So you've joined the others too. Bunch of lily-livers! Please, friends. No, they're not a bunch of lily-livers. They're the majority, and the majority is the voice of wisdom. You're the crazy ones - you, Barbero, and you! You who think 13 hours a day on the job is enough. You who'd like a few extra pennies. You who'd like to avoid the hospital or the poorhouse. The majority are the wise ones. They feel their salary is enough. The proof: No one has actually died of starvation yet. And statistics show that only 20%% of you are maimed in accidents. How many are here? Five hundred? Then only 100 of you will end up crippled. You, Baietto, or you, Occhipinti, or your daughter Gasperina. Mondino, where are you? - Right here. Show them! That's what the majority wants! No! We've starved for 30 days now. We've lost! Can't you see? - Who says so? - Everyone! Friends, it's not true. We haven't lost. This is the crucial moment. The side holding out just one hour longer wins! The bosses are even worse-off! - How do you know? - I know! You must believe me! - No more blind faith! - Our cupboards are empty! - And our stomachs too! Your stomachs will stay empty, and your children's too, if you give up this fight now! The bosses will always win, and your misery will continue to enrich them! It's not our factory! Not yours? Who works there 14 hours a day their whole life? Whose sweat keeps the machines going? Ours! Then take it! The factory is yours! Show them it means more to you than your own homes! Make the bosses, the city, and the government see that it's your life and death! Go, my friends! Got it bad, eh? Seeing her again? They're good people. Attention! Present arms! All officers are to report immediately. Sound the call. That's us! All leaves are canceled! Fall in, quickly! Dress quickly! Look lively! All leaves are canceled! WE'RE NOT ANIMALS! WE WANT A 13-HOUR DAY! Company halt! Captain, what should we do? Clear the square. Line up in front of the factory, men! Company forward! Halt! Dismount! In rank, forward march! Give me a piece. What are we doing here? I don't really know... but I smell trouble. Here they come! Ready. Company, ready! Cowards! Criminals! - Bastards! - Exploiters of the people! You're on the bosses' side! Let us through! We want to enter the factory! The factory is ours! Come here, you! Raoul! Get ready, and stay calm. They've got you in their sights! Beat it! Disperse! Stop! Murderers! Captain, what do we do? Get back or we open fire! Take aim and prepare to fire! Fire! Omero! Where are you going? Are you crazy? - Where are you going? - Let me go! It's your fault! Goddamn you! You killed him! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Let me go! Hello, Adele. I couldn't go to your place. The police are still standing guard. I collected a few things from our friends. - And the professor? - Still in jail. But we're making him a candidate in upcoming elections. If he's elected, they'll have to let him go. Cenerone and Cesarina are going door-to-door for him. Good idea. He sent you this. A friend's address in Lugano. Amazing. He doesn't give up. Even in jail he's thinking of others. The train. Write to me! What? Write to me! But you can't read! Write anyway!
