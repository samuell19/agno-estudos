TREVOR: Maggie, Maggie. Smile for the camera. Beautiful. Why don't you tell me how you and Randy met? - Okay, um, it's pretty simple. We worked at the same accounting firm in Minnesota. And one day he asked me out for coffee, which is kind of weird 'cause he doesn't like coffee. But I guess he loves me, so... TREVOR: Do you love him? - I do, yeah. TREVOR: What about him do you love? - Um, I don't know. TREVOR: What do you mean? How can you not know? - I don't know, it changes everyday. TREVOR: What changes? - He just, um... I don't know. I don't think I'm making sense. Can we start over? TREVOR: There he is. PAT: Good old Randy. DANIEL: Alright, quiet. Let's go. - Are you serious? Help, I'm being abducted! Help! PAT: Shh! - Alright, alright. A surprise party. I get it. Now do I really need a blindfold? - Yeah man, just keep it on. - And it's not a surprise party. - Yeah, okay. TREVOR: Nah, it's really not. - Why are you sitting so close to me, dude? - I just really missed you, Randy. - Oh my gosh. - I could just look, but I kind of wanna guess. - You're not gonna guess it. RANDY: Well, who else would hang out with you idiots? - Is it Martin? ALL: [yelling] Marty! [Trevor laughing] - Aye, Marty! TREVOR: No, it's not Martin. - I wish it was Martin. RANDY: Jason Phillips? - I'm telling you, you're not gonna guess it. RANDY: Let's see. REBECCA: Ew, stop! RANDY: Alright. Okay, it's a girl. REBECCA: It's Rebecca Summers. RANDY: Rebecca Summers? Like, from middle school? - Yeah, in the flesh. - Whoa, oh god, it is you. - Hey, hey, hey. Randy, put the blindfold back on. RANDY: Alright, alright. Sorry! DANIEL: Listen, I promise it'll be worth it, alright? TREVOR: Yo, Daniel. DANIEL: What? TREVOR: Look at this. DANIEL: Oh, man. Yo, we're playing this. We're playing this. [rock music] - Ah, no way. REBECCA: What is this? - Bicurious George! - It's our band. REBECCA: This is you guys? - Yeah, from high school. - Dude, ah! See what you missed? GUYS: [singing] Is that what you mean? GUYS: [singing] Is that what you mean? GUYS: [singing] Is that what you mean? RANDY: [singing] Well, you don't mean a thing to me. [Laughing] - So, this is gonna be like the end of your movie? TREVOR: Yep, pretty much. - And it's just for Randy? TREVOR: Yep. Alright, can you move (mumbles) - Yeah, wait. Wait a minute. I'm home, and I don't get my own movie? TREVOR: Uh, yeah well, it's a little different. He's home for good. - No, yeah I know. I'm just kidding. TREVOR: Alright. - Okay. TREVOR: That's good. Okay, you ready? - Yep. TREVOR: You're sure it's cool if I film you? - Yeah, that's fine. I just wanna know what it's about. TREVOR: I just want an honest reaction from people. Do you remember Randy Freeman from high school? - Randy, yeah, he always got detention for having his phone out. - Yeah, how could anyone forget Randy? - I've never heard of him. TREVOR: He was your ex-boyfriend... two years. - Nah, never happened. - Yeah, I remember him. Where's he been? TREVOR: Well, he moved away right after high school but he's coming home in a little bit. I'm making him a welcome home video. - Hi, Randy! TREVOR: Tall guy, goofy laugh... - Nope, don't know him. Certainly wouldn't have dated him. - I actually wrote on his wall the other day to wish him a happy birthday TREVOR: So you guys keep in touch? - Not really. I just said happy birthday. - I blocked him, actually. One of his tweets spoiled American Idol. - Yeah, of course I knew him. He never shut the hell up. - Dude, come on. Put the blindfold back on. - Dan, come on. You think I haven't figured it out by now? The Burke brothers, Trevor, freaking Rebecca Summers. We're gonna dig up the time capsule, aren't we? PAT: I told you he grew a brain [mumbles] - I knew it! I knew it! The time capsule! - Well, it's not like we know where we're going anyway. RANDY: Well yeah, I mean how old's this map? - Probably like twelve years old, actually. RANDY: No way, really? REBECCA: No yeah, 'cause we did it right before I moved. TREVOR: First up on the time capsule map is The Raging Rapids. Which means... we're getting somewhere. RANDY: Dude, I think the circle's where we buried it. DANIEL: Really? RANDY: Yeah. PAT: No, I'm not buying it. X marks the spot. That's basic treasure map lingo. RANDY: Ah, I don't know, man. Come on, Dan. We were dumb. We're the ones who drew it. We should know. - Yeah, uh. I'm pretty sure it's the X. REBECCA: It's not gonna matter either way. We're not gonna find it. - Yes, we are. Ten steps away from the fence post! RANDY: That's right! Ten steps from the post. RANDY: Come on, Dan. I'll follow your lead. - ...gonna be something. - What about you, Pat? What did you put in there? - A yo-yo. [laughing] - Of course you did. - Hey, you guys are gonna be going through the letters and pictures and shit I'm gonna be over here with my yo-yo like a badass. [laughing] TREVOR: And here we have the Sea of Wonder. ...and Pat! RANDY: Yeah, so I mean, if you look past the duck face and all, I'd give her a solid eight. PAT: So, she wants nothing to do with you. RANDY: Uh, that's where you're wrong. I got some other pictures to prove you wrong there, buddy. PAT: Oh well, yeah. You can't even see her face in these. - Why would I care about her face? - Randy, don't you have a girlfriend? - Maybe. Why? You hitting on me? - [scoffs] you wish. [laughing] - So, next week on "Asshole Chronicles..." - Hey, come on! - What? You're an asshole. DANIEL: Alright, guys, guys... If the X is where we buried the time capsule then I'm pretty sure we need to make this right. Um, that makes the circle I'm guessing the fence post. PAT: Wait, what are these things around here? - Creek rocks, you know... - So, you drew rocks and not a key? RANDY: It's hidden treasure. There's no key. - Ah, that's right. - Exactly. Exactly. Thank you, thank you. - Well done, gentlemen. Well done. RANDY: I'll catch up with you later. See you later. So what are you filming everything for anyway? TREVOR: Uh, just a little project I'm doing. - Oh yeah? That's cool. What's it for? TREVOR: You'll see. - You guys and your surprises, man. Damn. TREVOR: So uh, Randy. - Yeah? TREVOR: Are you really cheating on Maggie? - Uh, I don't know, man. I wouldn't call it cheating. TREVOR: Uh, that's what I'd call it. I don't know. - Dude, trust me. It's nothing like that. TREVOR: Look, Maggie seems really cool. I'd just treat her better. - Dude, you sound just like her, man. You're like spot on with that impression. [leaves rustling] DANIEL: [from the distance] Yo guys, check this out. You guys remember this from before? TREVOR: Nah. PAT: Nope. TREVOR: Is it on the map? - No. - Oh, well you gotta put it on the map. RANDY: There they are, get them-- TREVOR: Shh! Alright, we got a new addition to our park map here: The Shelter from the Storm. - Is that it? PAT: Oh, it is! DANIEL: That's it. [cheering] TREVOR: Alright. - See, I told you. [incoherent mocking] ALL: Seven, eight, nine, ten. TREVOR: Whoo! REBECCA: It's not gonna be here. - Yeah, it will. Alright, Pat, let me see the shovel. - I don't have it. TREVOR: What? REBECCA: You didn't bring the shovel? - No, it was in the trunk. Didn't you grab it? - Do I look like I grabbed it? - Hey, guys. It's alright. We got this. We just gotta find some way to dig and, you know, we'll be fine. - Right. Everyone fan out, look for a big branch or something. We'll see if we can dig it up. Rebecca, don't move. I have a good feeling about that spot. - Aye, aye. DANIEL: Thank you. Alright, everyone fan out. TREVOR: Hello? [distant screaming] TREVOR: Hello? [screaming] TREVOR: Hello? Who's -- guys? TREVOR: Hey guys, guys. Was that you screaming? - See! See, Trevor heard it. TREVOR: Wait, you didn't hear it? PAT: No, we didn't. REBECCA: No, they don't believe me. - Is Randy with you? TREVOR: No. Do you think that was him screaming? PAT: No, he's probably just lost. TREVOR: I don't know. - No, he definitely is. Randy! We're over here asshole! Yo, let me take a turn. - Go for it. - Taking too long... - A half hour is a long time! - I understand that. - Yeah, but it's not that big of a park! TREVOR: Maybe he just went back to the car to get the shovel. - No, that doesn't make sense. I have the keys. TREVOR: Yeah well, I don't know. PAT: He's just screwing with us. He's probably somewhere in a bush, looking at us, laughing his ass off. - Randy, it's not funny! You're not funny! TREVOR: Alright, well. Why don't we just split up, and then-- - No, no. That's what got us into this mess. TREVOR: Alright. - Let's just go the way he went. TREVOR: Alright. ALL: Randy. Randy. Randy! TREVOR: Wait, is that him? DANIEL: Randy, you asshole! - Nah, stupid squirrel. Randy! - No, I'm not leaving! - If we had some service we could give him a call. TREVOR: It's getting dark, Rebecca. I don't know, it's starting to rain. - Trevor, we both heard something. He could be hurt. - I honestly think he's just screwing with us. - Well, I think you're wrong. - Why do you even care, anyway? You barely know the guy. Remember, you said "he's an asshole." - I care. I drove six hours just to see you guys. - Oh, six hours. Dan, six hours. TREVOR: Alright, at this point I think we just have to leave and try to call him. - It's probably best. - Alright, well I'm just gonna stay here-- - No, we are staying together. - We can't just leave him out here. - Rebecca, we are staying together. - Alright, fine. [distant sirens] - If he answers, I'm gonna kill him. [sighs] He didn't answer. TREVOR: Alright, well why don't we try calling his mom's house? - We haven't used that number in years. - I remember it. TREVOR: You do? - Yeah. [distant sirens] - What if he's not there? - What do you mean? - Like what if she hasn't heard from him? What do I say? REBECCA: That we lost him. MRS. FREEMAN: Hello? - Hey, Mrs. Freeman? How you doing? I'm sorry. It's Danny Burke. It's Danny Burke. It's been a while. - How is this our fault? - Because we were the last ones that were with him. - Yeah, but that doesn't matter. He's not a little kid. TREVOR: Alright, Dan. What did she say? - Um, he's okay. - He texted her like ten, fifteen minutes ago. PAT: I told you guys, he's fine. - I'm guessing that he's just at his apartment with Maggie. TREVOR: Yeah, I guess. REBECCA: Why did he just ditch us then? - He probably got lost and didn't have service. - Oh, he didn't have service? Well then, how come he could text his mom? Why couldn't he text us? [rain pattering] - Oh, Randy! How's he doing? TREVOR: Uh, pretty good I think. He's moving back in a couple weeks. - Minnesota, really? So that's why I haven't seen him in years. - He's not opening for the Foo Fighters yet? TREVOR: [laughing] No, not yet. - Hey Randy, welcome home! TREVOR: Is there anything you wanna say to him? - Randy, if you're watching this, we should hang out soon. TREVOR: Why don't you just text him? - Yeah, I guess. I'll just slide into his DMs or something. - Dude, he's really rocking out right there. He's killing it. Dude, there's probably like no chicks in Minnesota. Can you imagine? TREVOR: Hey. - Hey. TREVOR: Uh, thanks again for meeting me. MAGGIE: Yeah, sure. Are you filming me right now? TREVOR: Yeah, I thought it would be cool to document all the recent drama. - Well, I don't think it's very cool. TREVOR: Real quick. You're saying that Randy never came home last night? - Do I really have to say this all again? TREVOR: No, no. I got it. Okay, Randy texted Maggie, and said that he was staying at his mom's last night. - Yeah, and apparently it was a lie. TREVOR: So he's not with you, and he's not with his mom. Where do you think he is? - Look, I don't even really know you. I don't want to play detective with you. TREVOR: Okay, I'm sorry. - [sighs] What if he's cheating on me? TREVOR: Look, I don't think so. - Well, I do. TREVOR: Alright, he's gonna be really pissed that I told you. But he and I were talking yesterday, and he said that he was gonna-- - Trevor, can you please stop filming? TREVOR: Yeah, I can do that. TREVOR: Alright, so I told her that Randy was planning a big surprise for her. - You lied, Trevor. TREVOR: Yeah, I know but look, I didn't know what to do. - Yeah, but I still wouldn't have lied. PAT: She's right, though. He's obviously hooking up with that chick he was showing me yesterday. - No, he wouldn't do that. Maggie just moved in with him. - This is Randy we're talking about. - Yeah, but he's not in high school anymore, Pat. - Dude, he was literally showing me pictures of tits. - Yeah, check it out. This is all he sent. TREVOR: "I'm okay"? - Yeah, "I'm okay." It's weird, right? TREVOR: Yeah, that's weird. - Alright, what should I say? - Just get to the point: "Will you go out with me?" DANIEL: Pat, I'm serious. - Well, you should probably warn him. Because of this dickhead, Maggie's gonna be expecting a big surprise party when he gets home. TREVOR: Alright, come on. - How about this? "Hey Randy, heads up. "Maggie knows you weren't at your mom's last night. "Maybe you should talk with her." TREVOR: Alright, that's good. And tell him that we didn't tell Maggie about that other girl. - No, I don't wanna accuse him of anything. TREVOR: Wait, is that Randy? - Nah, it's Rebecca. TREVOR: Oh, damn. What does she want? - She says she's still in Philly. Wants to know what we're up to. We can get together with her. Go over everything. PAT: There's nothing to go over. - I mean, Pat, she was there. We could use her input. TREVOR: Yeah, I'm down. - Alright, let's go. - No, we already went through everything. - We could get milkshakes. [paper rustling] - Alright. - I don't know, maybe he's just with that other girl still, and his phone died. - Or, it's none of our business. - He could be in trouble, Pat. - That's his problem. - Pat! - He can take care of himself. - You do realize we were the last ones to have seen him right? Like to actually have looked at him? - He texted his mom. His girlfriend. And Dan. - Anyone can text. - Guys. Guys, what are we trying to imply here? He stopped posting pictures of his lunch. He didn't go missing. It's a big difference. [door creaking] [background chatter] TREVOR: Any luck, Daniel? - No man, I checked his Twitter, his Facebook, Tumblr, nothing. - It's just weird. - Alright. I didn't want to have to be the one telling you guys this, but something happened to Randy out there in the woods. REBECCA: What? TREVOR: What is it? - Randy got mauled by a bear. [laughter] - Oh my god. [texting notification] - Bam. Look, it's Randy. He's probably just... - What? What is it? DANIEL: Pat. TREVOR: What he say? - He said... "I'm okay." REBECCA: What? Isn't that what he said that you? DANIEL: Yeah, exactly that. - See! See, that's weird! - No, he's just messing with us. - Why though? Why would he do that? - It's Randy. He's just being a dick. Randy. What a guy, what a guy. TREVOR: What's your favorite thing about him? - I don't know. I haven't seen him in a while. I guess his Snapchats. They're pretty funny. - He would always say hi at school even if you'd already seen him. He just knew everybody's name. - We used to be close, like really close. But then in high school, he started hanging out with other people. TREVOR: Like who? - I don't know. Everyone? No one? I couldn't even tell you. Uh, what was the question again? TREVOR: What's your favorite thing about him? - Um... His biceps. - What are we even doing out here? DANIEL: I told you you didn't have to come. - Yeah, well it's not like I had anything better to do. - I mean what do you expect to find? Some sort of clue to put in your little Randy dandy notebook? TREVOR: Guys, guys. Hold on. Hold on. Maggie's calling me. DANIEL: Trevor, come on. You don't need to be filming right now. TREVOR: Alright, I'm sorry. Alright. She said she got the same exact text from Randy last night. - What? "I'm okay"? TREVOR: Yeah. - And he's still not home? TREVOR: No, he's still not home. - That can't be Randy sending those texts then. - I think we're pretty close to the post. Let's just go back, retrace our steps from the other day, and see what we can come up with. TREVOR: Okay. [distant sirens] - But there's like a window to find missing people. It's like two days. - He's not missing, though. - Yes, he is. - Pat, you guys went this way, right? PAT: Yeah. Look, missing people don't send texts. REBECCA: Yeah, but people who aren't missing don't send everyone the same text for two days. PAT: I don't know what to tell you. DANIEL: Guys, guys. Check this out. TREVOR: What? DANIEL: Look. PAT: It's a finger. TREVOR: What? REBECCA: Oh my god, guys. No, you better be messing around. DANIEL: No, he's not. It's a finger. TREVOR: Do you think that's Randy's finger? PAT: This is why we need Maggie. TREVOR: What? - What? She would know more than anyone. REBECCA: Aw, come on. TREVOR: Come on, dude. PAT: It's not Randy's finger, though. - Well then whose finger is it? DANIEL: It looks a little small for his. REBECCA: Well people have pinkies, Daniel. - Apparently not everyone. - Can we please just stop talking about this? Let's just get out of here. Let's just go to the cops. TREVOR: Alright. PAT: I'm not picking it up. REBECCA: Come on, guys. DANIEL: I'll pick it up. Just give me something to put it in. - I think we should talk to his mom. [branches snapping] [video chat ringing] - Hey. - Hey listen, Trevor. I'm not gonna skype you everytime I can just call you. - Look, it's for the movie. - Alright, so I spoke with his mom. She said she's gonna file a missing person's report. - Alright, yeah. That makes sense at this point. Well, do you think it was his? - What? The finger? - Yeah. - Yeah, I mean, at this point unfortunately whose else could it be? - Well, do you think the cops are gonna want to talk to us? - Yeah, I think so. - What do we tell them? - I say we just tell them the truth. - About everything? Like what about the girl he was texting? - Look, Pat and I told his mom about her. We told her about everything. - Yeah, but Maggie's gonna find out, right? - Yeah, that's right. - It's gonna hurt her. I mean she moved all the way out here for him. - Yeah, but that can't be on us. At this point, it's on Randy. - Really, why would you ask me about him? TREVOR: It's to show him when he comes home. - You know he cheated on me. - I mean, I don't really know him now but I hope he's doing alright. - Yeah, I kind of miss him. - He always had to be the center of attention. Kept sending me Facebook invites. Like dude, I don't want to go to your stupid toga party. - Did you really hang out with him? TREVOR: I mean, yeah. More when we were little. - He sent me a picture of his-- [laughing] TREVOR: Welcome to the high-brow humor of Dan and Pat's place. DANIEL: [laughing] High-brow humor. PAT: This is my pee-pee. [ringing] TREVOR: Can I get in on this? DANIEL: Yeah. TREVOR: There we go. - Hello? PAT: Hey Rebecca, we found Randy. - What? Where - I? - Sorry, the good news is he's okay. DANIEL: Alright, so it was like the middle of the night. He sends me the link to his blog. - What? His stupid Tumblr? DANIEL: No. TREVOR: It's a new blog. Just go ahead, show her. DANIEL: Alright. So he basically talks about leaving, starting a new life... We're thinking he just bailed. TREVOR: Again. - Wait, hold on a second. How do we even know that it was Randy who actually sent the blog? Or that he even wrote it? PAT: No, he did. Look. He post pictures from like every day that he's been gone. See that. Day three. Two. See that? - Alright, well... send me the link and I'll look at it and then I'll call you guys back. - Okay, hold on a second. - This is just like when he left after high school, isn't it? One day here. One day gone. TREVOR: Yeah, but this time he was literally hanging out with us. I mean, it's ridiculous. - I'm thinking he was just waiting until he wasn't with Maggie. TREVOR: Yeah, I guess. He's an asshole, though. [clearing throat] PAT: There she is. - Hey! - Oh my god, I can't believe that I stayed in Philly because I was actually worried about him. - So you read the blog then? - Yeah, I read it. PAT: I don't wanna tell you, "I told you so," but... DANIEL: Hey, when are you going home? - Tonight, I guess. DANIEL: Well, would you like to come over here first? We could have a little get together before you go. - Yeah, alright. That sounds fun. DANIEL: Alright cool. [hammering] [chattering] - Oh, I see the - hold on. I got it. I got it. I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get it. [whining] PAT: Hold my - hold my cup. REBECCA: I'll pour it on your head. [scratching] REBECCA: Did you get it? PAT: Yeah, he got it. REBECCA: No, I don't believe you. [stomping] PAT: Yeah, he got it. REBECCA: I don't believe you. TREVOR: It's gone. No spider. REBECCA: It was just [mumbles] TREVOR: Don't worry. No spider. - Yeah, it's in there. You wanna look at it? REBECCA: [yelling] I don't believe you. PAT: Go look at it. REBECCA: It's right there you freaking liars! TREVOR: Where? PAT: Where? REBECCA: [yelling] Right there! PAT: Oh, that's a different one. TREVOR: Okay, alright, everyone. I have an announcement to make. - Let me guess: you're pregnant. TREVOR: Yeah, I'm pregnant. - Oh, congrats man. TREVOR: I just want to say thanks to everyone who did a welcome home interview for Randy. Actually, a special thanks to Randy. What a guy. [booing] TREVOR: Alright, it's okay. I'm done. I'm gonna make him a new video: a farewell video. 'Cause guess what? If he comes back, he's not gonna be welcome. - Here, here! [cheering] - Alright, I got a toast. To Randy: douchebag at twelve years old. Bigger douchebag at twenty-four. [light laughter] [folk music] [singing] Don't ask me why 'cause I've got to get away. [singing] I've come to see that I welcome the end of our stay. [singing] Don't waste no time following. - There he is! [singing] Miles away... [drumming] [singing] Miles away... [background chatter] [fire crackling] PAT: Let me see that real quick. PAT: Let me see that real quick. Look at me. I'm Trevor. I film everything on my smartphone. Look at me. I'm Trevor. I film everything on my smartphone. TREVOR: It's weird, isn't it? - What? TREVOR: I don't know. The old gang back together again. - Yeah, well. Not exactly everyone, right? TREVOR: Hey, forget Randy, alright? - Yeah, I guess. His girlfriend, Maggie. I mean, she seemed like she was pretty cool, right? TREVOR: Yeah, she's actually really cool. 'Cause it seemed like he finally had something to hold onto. At least that's what -- TREVOR: I know, I know, and then... yeah. Yeah, I know. Who knows? - So how many people did you wind up actually interviewing for the movie? TREVOR: Uh, a lot. Probably way too many. - It's a shame he won't ever be able to see it. You know, with all that work you put into it. TREVOR: Yeah, I know. - Well, I mean... we could still it. You wanna see it tonight? TREVOR: Tonight? Uh... [background laughing] TREVOR: You know what? Maybe later. - Whatever. PAT: Thanks, Trevor. DANIEL: Too soon? [unzipping] [snapping] - What? We get the most complicated contraption here? DANIEL: Trevor wanted it for effect. - Alright, well... - At least Trevor's here to film us doing this. Thanks Trevor. PAT: Watch the tree. - Yep, this is a bit of overkill. TREVOR: Nah, see. Once you see my film it's gonna make complete sense. REBECCA [on screen]: So this gonna be like the end of your movie? [laughing] TREVOR [on screen]: Alright, can you move... REBECCA [on screen]: Wait a minute. I'm home, and I don't get my own movie? TREVOR [on screen]: Yeah, well it's a little different... PAT: Can I get my own movie? RANDY [on screen]: Come on, you think I haven't figured it out by now? The Burke Brothers, Trevor, freaking Rebecca Summers. TREVOR: Why'd he always call her freaking Rebecca Summers? - Freaking Rebecca Summers. REBECCA [on screen]: Randy, don't you have a girlfriend? DANIEL: Hold on a second. Can you... can you pause it real quick? TREVOR: Yeah, sure. REBECCA [on screen]: So next week on... DANIEL: Just stop it for a second. Alright, now rewind a little bit. REBECCA [on screen]: ...have a girlfriend? DANIEL: There! There! You see it? TREVOR: See what? PAT: Randy's big ass Adam's apple? DANIEL: No, seriously. REBECCA [on screen]: "Asshole Chronicles" RANDY [on screen]: Hey, come on! - There. Do you see it? TREVOR: I do see that. What the hell is that? DANIEL: Can you zoom in a little bit? TREVOR: Yeah, I'll try. - It's probably just an animal. DANIEL: No, I think it looks like a person. - Or an animal. DANIEL: No, that is not an animal. PAT: Oh no, you're right. It's just a big, black blob. DANIEL: Or a person, Pat. PAT: Alright, so it's a person. You know we weren't the only ones in the woods. DANIEL: Then why'd you say it looked like an animal? - Oh, I'm sorry for suggesting something as ridiculous as an animal-- - Trevor, can you just take a screenshot, please? TREVOR: Yeah, I'll do that. DANIEL: Pat, this is the day that Randy went missing. PAT: There it is! He didn't go missing. We just went over this. He ran away! TREVOR: Yeah, but look at this thing. It's like standing on two legs. PAT: It's probably just someone walking their dog or something. TREVOR: [sigh] I don't know. - You know what it is? - What? - It's Bigfoot. Guys, we found Bigfoot! TREVOR: Pat, this is really creepy. - Someone or something was out there watching us. - Like for a split second. - It doesn't matter. - What are you doing? - I'm taking a picture and sending it to Randy. PAT: Why? What are you trying to do? - 'Cause I'm seeing if he remembers anyone else in the woods. - Dan, I know that trying to get the whole gang back together was a big fail but you gotta let this go! - He's my best friend. Has been since we were five years old. - He's really coming home? I never thought I'd see him again. TREVOR: Why not? - We grew up together. Uh, we played on the same teams. Went to the same schools, you know. TREVOR: Did you hang out in school? - Yeah. Um, sometimes. He hung out with a lot of people. But you know, sometimes. - He used to tell me that he hated school, but he hated his house even more, so... yeah. - I don't know, I always thought there was more to Randy besides the whole goofball persona. He always mentioned that I was quiet. I don't know. Maybe I'm a good listener. [texting notification] [continuous texting notifications] TREVOR: Daniel. Hey, Daniel. DANIEL: What? TREVOR: Your phone keeps going off. No, seriously. It won't stop. It's Randy. [continuous texting notifications] - Trevor, look at this. Holy crap. Pat. Wake up, wake up. Pat, it's Randy. - What? Does he keep saying the same thing? - Yeah. TREVOR: Yes. PAT: Alright, well... respond then. [texting notification] PAT: Okay... DANIEL: It stopped. TREVOR: That's it, then? PAT: Dude, there's something wrong with your phone. DANIEL: No, there's nothing wrong with my phone. TREVOR: Clearly, and let's stop pretending that's actually Randy texting us. PAT: Well, who is it then? TREVOR: I don't know. That's the whole freaking problem. PAT: [sighing] Alright. DANIEL: "Alright" what? Where are you going? Well, I don't know. Should I respond to him? Or whoever has his phone? TREVOR: [sighs] I think he'll just keep sending the same damn text. - Eh, what's the scoop? Have we cracked the case yet? - DANIEL: Enough, Pat. We're gonna go call the police again. TREVOR: Wow, Pat. You know what... - Why? We have the world's greatest detective of the whole east coast right here in our backyard. DANIEL: You know we have every right to be upset. - Kids get kidnapped. Kids. That's why they call it kidnapping... not grown-ass-man-napping. DANIEL: Guys, guys. I got a snapchat. TREVOR: Wait, from Randy? DANIEL: Yeah. PAT: Yeah, see. He's probably just sending pictures from his road trip or something. DANIEL: Wait. PAT: See, he's with people... wait. TREVOR: Is that - DANIEL: It's us. TREVOR: Oh my god. That's - DANIEL: From tonight. TREVOR: That's us from tonight. What the - - Take a - take a screenshot. How did you not get a screenshot? TREVOR: Guys, it's fine. I have it all on film. I have it on film. - Let's head to the police station right now. Trevor, bring your videos. TREVOR: Okay. [footsteps] [knocking] - Why are you here? TREVOR: Can I come in? - No. TREVOR: It's about Randy. - I don't care, Trevor. You lied. He's planning a big surprise for me? What the hell was that? TREVOR: I was trying... Look, you were getting upset and I was just trying to help. - Well, good job. I feel great now. Why do you keep filming me? Do you just always go around filming people? TREVOR: Look, we don't think Randy's safe. He didn't write the blog. He didn't take the pictures. Someone else did. - What are you talking about? TREVOR: Can I please just come in? - Fine. I just don't understand. Why would somebody take Randy? TREVOR: I don't know. - And why were they messing with you guys? TREVOR: I don't know. Do you know if somebody has something against him? - I don't even know anyone here. TREVOR: Right. - When I read that blog post, I just - I couldn't even think straight. And now you're saying he's in trouble? TREVOR: Yeah, look. I know what we're saying is really hard to believe but it's the truth. - I don't know what to do, Trevor. TREVOR: I know... - I'm all alone now. I got a lease. I still have no job. I thought... I thought he was okay, and I was so pissed at him. TREVOR: Look, I'm here for you. I want you to know that. - Is it bad that I hope you're right? That someone did take him? At least then he didn't abandon me. TREVOR: No, I don't think that's bad. Hey, Daniel's gonna find him. Really, he won't let it go until he does. You okay? - Mhmm. TREVOR: Alright, don't worry. Dan and Pat are good guys. [knocking] - Hey. TREVOR: Hey, Pat. Uh, this is Maggie. - Hey. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear about Randy. Um, we have something we wanna show you. TREVOR: Alright. Your brother's inside? PAT: Yep, he's down here. TREVOR: You guys get any sleep last night? - Alright, so we've been looking over those videos you took. We can't see anything but that dark figure. TREVOR: Okay. - So we've been working on this. What do you think? TREVOR: Oh yeah, yeah. That's perfect. - I mean if you like it, I think we should post it like everywhere. TREVOR: Okay. - I'm thinking instead of posting it around town, maybe we just post it online. Wherever the cops can't take it down. Like Instagram, Craigslist, anywhere like that. - Show him the blog post. - Alright. TREVOR: So what is that he's pointing to? DANIEL: It's the date on today's paper. MAGGIE: So he's alive. - Yeah, and I'm pretty sure he's got all his fingers. - Fingers? What? TREVOR: Oh, yeah. Um... we found a finger. - Yeah but, doesn't him being in one piece screw up our entire case? - He seems fine. TREVOR: I mean, it's hard to say for sure about his finger. MAGGIE: I mean, look. He's smiling. DANIEL: Yeah, but that's bullshit. TREVOR: Okay, hold on. Let me read this. - Trevor? TREVOR: Yeah? - Do you think we're in over our heads? TREVOR: What do you mean? - I mean we're not cops. TREVOR: Well, you should have seen how much help they were. PAT: Hey, Trevor? - Can I talk to you for a second? TREVOR: Uh, yeah. - Sorry. TREVOR: Hold on. - Step into my office. [laughing] You can sit down. TREVOR: Okay. PAT: Won't take long. - Alright so, with everything going on, obviously you guys were concerned. Someone has Randy. And you know, I'm sorry. For not taking it seriously. TREVOR: Hey, it's all good. It's a crazy situation. - Yeah, it is. [loud printing] [paper rustling] - Okay, we've got a couple leads from the video. We have the dark figure in the background which could be an animal. PAT: It's not an animal. DANIEL: We have where we all split up and Pat, you were last one to see Randy. PAT: I have no idea where he went. DANIEL: We've got the finger. TREVOR: But it's not his finger. DANIEL: And lastly, we've got the girl he was texting. MAGGIE: Right. TREVOR: But we don't have her name. PAT: Vicki! MAGGIE: What? DANIEL: Wait, you know her name? - I think that's what he said her name was. TREVOR: Why didn't you tell us before? - I didn't know we were looking for her name. TREVOR: Of course we want her name. - Wait, wait. If we have her name, it means we can find her. TREVOR: Anything? - Mm-mm. DANIEL: Guys, guys. I think I found her. TREVOR: Really? DANIEL: Yeah, take a look. MAGGIE: Wait, that's Vicki? TREVOR: Vicki... Simmons. PAT: Yeah, that's her. That's definitely her. DANIEL: Alright, this is good. We have like no mutual friends. Not even Randy. MAGGIE: Are you sure he was talking to her? - Yeah, that's what he told me before. Just message her. - So Randy was my first boyfriend. Probably when we were around... fourteen years old. TREVOR: And how did that happen? - I used to have a huge crush on him, actually. He always knew. So whatever, I'll tell the whole world. - Yeah, I never really got the appeal, but I knew him of course. - Yeah, I knew a lot of girls who liked him. I think they fell for his confidence. - He never asked me out, but I did make his Top 8 on Myspace so that's something, right? - He kissed me in the middle of class. Um, like literally in the middle of class. The teacher turned around, he turned and kissed me, and then asked me to be his Valentine. TREVOR: So the legend is true? - Yeah, it's true. DANIEL: It's just trees. There's nothing but trees in the background. TREVOR: Well, what kind of trees are they? - Oh, I'm not sure. I don't know. Maybe birch. I don't know, why? TREVOR: It can help us narrow down the area. - Yeah, that's true. - Good thing we're tree experts. [darts hitting] [computer notification] - Guys, she replied. "I've never heard of Randy Freeman. Sorry." TREVOR: That's it? MAGGIE: That's it. - Well, what else can we do? Go out to Colorado? TREVOR: Well, it just says she lives in Colorado. - Yeah, and we don't even know if this Vicki Simmons is a real person. - Well, someone replied to us. - Pat, anyone can take pictures and make a fake profile. - So, Randy could've been talking to some creepy old dude? - I mean... I mean maybe. - Hold on, I have an idea. [video chat ringing] - Hello? - Vicki? - Yeah. - Okay, I just wanted to make sure that you are who you say you are. - Okay, yeah. It's me. Vicki Simmons. - And you've really never seen Randy Freeman before? Never even heard of him? - No, I haven't. He's really missing? DANIEL: Yes. - That's crazy. And he said he was talking to me? DANIEL: Yes. - I promise you I don't know him. MAGGIE: Why did he have pictures of you? - What? MAGGIE: Why did he have pictures of you? - What pictures? MAGGIE: Daniel, send her the pictures. - Alright, hold on. - I didn't send anyone these. Those are from my blog. - Wait, what blog? - It's on Tumblr. I can send you the link if you want. - Yes, please. MAGGIE: What about the nude pictures? Were they on your blog? - Excuse me? DANIEL: Yeah Maggie, Relax. MAGGIE: He had nude pictures. Didn't you say that? - No, he didn't. Not of me. MAGGIE: Yeah, he did. PAT: No, technically we're not sure. There were no faces in the pictures. - Guys, look. I really wish I could help you, but I just don't think I can. - It's just our friend said he was talking to you. - Well, he wasn't. I mean I have a lot of followers, and maybe someone stole my pictures and said they were me. - Yeah, but do you know who would've done that? - No, I don't know. But if there's any other way I can help, you can message me. - It's okay. - Look, I'm really sorry about your friend. - Thanks, Vicki. - So do you believe her? - Hold on a second. They're not friends on Facebook. Her pictures are up there on the blog so anyone could see it. TREVOR: Right. - And the nudes don't even show her face. TREVOR: But why pretend to be her? Like why Vicki Simmons? Steal her pictures... I get that. But why steal her real name? - I don't know, man. Alright, so someone definitely took a picture of us last night, right? - Yeah. - At our house. - Right. - Alright, whoever has Randy knows we're looking for him, and they know where we live. How could that be Vicki? MAGGIE: Yeah, but who else could it be? [car unlocking] - Daniel, I was wondering... Who was in that Snapchat of you guys sleeping last night? Were all three of you in it? TREVOR: Uh, yeah. I think we all were, why? I can check the video. - I was just wondering. Goodnight. [engine humming] TREVOR: Hey. MAGGIE: Hey. TREVOR: So you think I kidnapped Randy? MAGGIE: No. TREVOR: I mean that's sure what it sounds like. - Well, there's a new picture on the blog of Randy. TREVOR: Okay. - And it's vertical. Like it was taken on a cell phone. TREVOR: Okay, so what? I'm not the only one who uses a cell phone to take pictures. That doesn't even make sense. - We didn't think you could hurt Randy. We didn't think you would. TREVOR: We? - Well, yeah... TREVOR: Like Pat and Daniel? They know about this? - Yeah, I don't know. We were just texting about it. TREVOR: And you made sure to like meet me in a public place. What do you think of me? - Yeah, I just wanted to make sure. I mean... I thought maybe you were playing a prank on us. Maybe you were doing it with Randy. TREVOR: I wouldn't do that. - It's just... you're filming everything. You're filming right now! TREVOR: So? So what? I wouldn't kidnap Randy. Or pretend to. I don't know why you would say that. - Okay, sorry. [phone ringing] - Hey. Yeah, I'm with him. It's Daniel. Okay, yeah. We'll be over. They think they found something. Do you want to go now? TREVOR: I - Yeah, I guess. I'm not really hungry anymore. - Can I ask you something else? TREVOR: Nothing to hide. - Why were you making him a welcome home video anyway? - Of all people, you're doing this for Randy? Why? He's so... basic. - What are you trying to do here? Find someone that actually likes him? TREVOR: He has five thousand Facebook friends. Plenty of people like Randy. - Correction: plenty of people know Randy. - Do you want to tell it? - No, please, go ahead. - Well, do you remember AIM, like instant messenger? TREVOR: Yeah, of course. - I never thought I'd see him again. Where's he been? TREVOR: Minnesota. - He should've just stayed there. Just saying... - So, Randy did this chat room thing when we were fifteen. It was just the three of us. He was trying to hook us up, but it was so obvious. It was kind of a weird way to introduce each other. - But I mean... like, we were too nervous to like actually talk. Like in real life. - Well, we started talking online, and the rest is history. TREVOR: Well, whatever Randy did, it obviously worked. - I know. I still haven't forgiven him. [laughing] - Alright, so you know how we were wondering why someone would steal Vicki's whole identity? And not just her pictures? TREVOR: Yeah. - Alright, I think we have the answer to that. WOMAN [on screen]: [muffled rambling] MAGGIE: What is this? - It's one of Vicki's videos. She has like a whole channel. - About what? PAT: Makeup. Dating advice. Stuff like that. VICKI [on screen]: The shimmers are just super nice. TREVOR: Alright, so what's your point? DANIEL: Well, we looked through all of them, and Randy commented on like every single one. - "You've been like a godsend to me, thank you." PAT: Here, this one's really cringey. MAGGIE: "You're so funny and cute, it's like you know exactly what guys want. "I wish you were my girlfriend." PAT: He was like all over this girl's dick. - Pat. TREVOR: Maggie? - It's fine. I'm going to the bathroom. VICKI [on screen]: So you can always keep the words a'flowing. DANIEL: Alright, so this is our answer. Someone wanted Randy. They knew he was obsessed with this Vicki Simmons. And they just pretended to be her. - So it is a catfish. - Yeah, I mean... Someone could've gotten him to go anywhere if he thought he was meeting up with her. TREVOR: Yeah, so they could kidnap him, though? - Yeah, I guess so. TREVOR: But why? VICKI [on screen]: ... that they don't even touch their food Like, having a full stomach actually reduces nerves. [footsteps] TREVOR: So how are you holding up? - I'm okay. TREVOR: We're gonna find him. We're getting closer. - Right. TREVOR: Okay, are you sure you're going to be okay? Alone? - Yeah. TREVOR: I can stay if you want. - Trevor, I'll be fine. TREVOR: Okay. Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. [latch unlocking] [door shutting] TREVOR: So we've got seven posts on the blog now. - Yeah, someone's overcompensating for the whole "I'm okay" thing. TREVOR: Yeah, but I guess we know he's still alive, right? - Yeah, but I wish he would stop looking at the damn pictures. DANIEL: Hold on. Hold on. Alright, so I know it's a stretch, but just bear with me, okay? TREVOR: Okay. DANIEL: What do you notice in this picture? PAT: He's clean shaven. DANIEL: Well, yeah. But try again. TREVOR: What? His hand? DANIEL: Yeah. - Hold on, I thought we established he wasn't missing any fingers. - We did, but he's showing us three fingers. - So? DANIEL: And this one from yesterday... TREVOR: Oh yeah, he has his hands on his knees... DANIEL: And he's showing us eight fingers. - So you think he's trying to tell us something? DANIEL: Yeah, 'cause look: He's pointing to a date. TREVOR: What was that? The 5th? DANIEL: And this one, he's holding a bag... but he's showing three fingers. TREVOR: Okay, so they're clues. - That's what I'm thinking. PAT: Mmm... [erasing] PAT: Honestly, I think you're reaching here. TREVOR: No, it makes sense. I mean... if Randy knows these pictures are going online... and he has to know that people are looking for him. - Right, and if he were smart, he'd try to send out a message. TREVOR: Yeah. DANIEL: It's just this first one doesn't make sense. TREVOR: What do you mean? DANIEL: He's not showing any fingers like the others. TREVOR: Oh, yeah. Well, it could be a zero. I don't know. Or maybe he just didn't know to do numbers yet. - The first picture doesn't tell us anything. TREVOR: I mean there's a couple ideas. DANIEL: No, no, no. He looks like he's holding a phone. TREVOR: Yeah I - I see that. DANIEL: Like he's making a call. TREVOR: I see it. DANIEL: It's a phone number. PAT: Alright, well... you still need one more number. - We'll get one in the blog tomorrow. He always puts a number up. TREVOR: I don't know. I think he's saying it's a phone number. PAT: No, he's not saying anything. Alright, if someone was to take a picture of you, you would have fingers in it, and no one would try to second guess that. So why are we trying to do that here? - Pat, it looks so intentional. - So he's just assuming that we would figure this out? - Maybe we're all he's got. [scratching] TREVOR: Look Daniel, I think Pat's got the right idea here. DANIEL: Well, hold on a second. Hold on. I put the three most common area codes around here. "215." "267." And "610." I added the six numbers from the pictures, and then did a 0 through 9 at the tail end of all of them assuming that we're gonna get another picture. TREVOR: Okay. - This gives us thirty numbers, which one of them's gotta be correct. Unless the "743" is the area code. Then we gotta wait for four more pictures. I don't think we can wait that long. TREVOR: So what're we gonna do? Just call them? - Yeah. TREVOR: What's that gonna do? - Well, I mean... if we call them, we can trace them, and we can potentially find him. TREVOR: Yeah, but all thirty numbers? - Yeah. TREVOR: Look man, I... - Listen, Trevor. I refresh that page like every five minutes in the hopes that we'll get this next picture. Sooner or later, there won't be one, and no picture, no Randy. - Hi everyone. My name's Joanne, and I am Randy's mom. TREVOR: When's the last time you saw Randy? - Graduation. - Graduation. - Graduation. - At graduation. - The day after his high school graduation. TREVOR: Have you kept in touch since then? - Well, you know he is very busy, and um... I do call, but he's not always there to pick it up. He tells me not to leave a voicemail, 'cause he doesn't listen to the voicemails. He tells me to text him instead, but you know, I'm his mom. I want to hear my son's voice. TREVOR: Well, I'm sure he's really happy to be coming home. - I know he is. - I know I am very excited. [footsteps] [door creaking] [knocking] TREVOR: Come on. [doorknob jiggles] [door shutting] [footsteps] [birds chirping] [door creaking] [knocking] - Yes? TREVOR: Hey, I'm looking for Maggie. She lives in the flat upstairs. - Yeah, I know who Maggie is. TREVOR: Um, do you know if she's home? - I have no idea. Did you try knocking on her door? TREVOR: Yeah, uh, she's not answering. - Well, that probably means she's not home. TREVOR: Right, um. Alright, well... If you see her, just tell her that Trevor was looking for her. - Okay. TREVOR: Alright, thank you. - So I think we know how they got to Randy. Now we need to figure out why, and that should lead us to who. TREVOR: I mean... we know it was someone who was stalking Randy so it has to be someone who knows him. - Yeah, but that could be me, you, or like five thousand other people. - No, they also know us. And they know where we live. Trevor: Right. - Trevor, what about the interviews you did? I mean... you let a lot of people know that he was coming home. Think anyone had an issue with him? TREVOR: I mean not enough to kidnap him. - You sure? - Well, what do you want us to do? Go after everyone who hated Randy in high school? - I don't know. [background chatter] [texting notification] DANIEL: I just got a text from Randy's phone. TREVOR: Wait, really? - Does anyone know that we're here right now? Did you guys tell anyone that we were gonna be here? PAT: No, why? - Trevor? TREVOR: No, I don't think so. - Look. - "Are you enjoying your breakfast?" TREVOR: Hey, Daniel. - What is going on, Trevor? TREVOR: I don't know. - First they know where we live. Now they know where we're eating breakfast. TREVOR: Yeah, it has nothing to do with me. - How do they always know where we are? PAT: Guys, hold on. I think I know how they keep finding us. Look, on Snapchat, you can track people's locations. TREVOR: And you have your location on? - Yeah, so whoever has Randy's phone can track mine. TREVOR: Damn it, Pat. - I'm sorry. I forgot all about it. TREVOR: Alright, well turn your location off. - Wait, so... they can find us using that app? PAT: Yeah. - Does this mean we can also find them? PAT: Yeah, holy crap, there he is. That's his phone. TREVOR: Wow, that's in the city. DANIEL: How far? - Half hour? Forty-five minutes? What the hell are we gonna do when we get there? TREVOR: Well, find Randy, I guess. - Alright, well... what about the person that kidnapped him? Are we just gonna forget about that whole thing? TREVOR: Yeah, it looks pretty run down. DANIEL: I think the window's open. Looks like someone left here in a hurry. There's a backdoor, but it's locked. [floorboards creaking] PAT: Should we check in the basement? DANIEL: Might as well. Let's go. [footsteps] [door squeaking] TREVOR: What the heck? - Pretty sure it's empty down here. - What is that? TREVOR: I have no idea. Okay, this is weird. [mumbling] TREVOR: There's some like sheets and stuff. [mumbling] [light banging] [shushing] PAT: Sorry. TREVOR: Okay. DANIEL: Let's try upstairs. [footsteps] [mumbling] [rattling] [rattling] [mumbling] [distant sirens] [floorboards creaking] TREVOR: Guess we're in the right place. What's going on over there? What are those? DANIEL: Looks like a bunch of receipts. TREVOR: Jesus... [plastic rustling] TREVOR: Wait, is that his phone? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. TREVOR: Why would they just leave his phone here? - I don't know. Let's just take what we can and get out of here. TREVOR: Alright. [video chat ringing] - Hey. - Hey uh, anything from Randy's phone yet? - No uh, Pat's still trying to find a charger for it. - Okay. - Uh, meantime though, have you checked the blog? - No, not recently. - Check it out. - Hold on. [typing] Shit, that's the house we were just in, isn't it? DANIEL: Yeah, same house. And if you even check... it says something about him forgetting his phone there. - Well, I think someone's just covering their tracks. - Right. - I guess at the very least, they can't track Pat's location now, right? - Yeah, but they already know where we live. I'm not too concerned with that. I just care about finding him. - Yeah, I know. You see his hand, though? - Yeah, seven fingers. - That's seven numbers now. - A phone number. I know. TREVOR: Okay so, what is all this? DANIEL: That's Pat's little art project... - No, I figured if we're sure it's someone that Randy knows, we should have all the suspects out there. TREVOR: What, like me? PAT: Yeah, you, me, Dan... everyone that we know. TREVOR: And what does the web mean then? PAT: I don't know, it seemed fitting, you know? Missing person's report and stuff. TREVOR [laughing]: So, it doesn't mean anything. - Should we just try it? DANIEL: How about we do something productive? TREVOR: Eh, it can't hurt. [dart hitting] TREVOR: So who do we got? PAT: Well, that's interesting. TREVOR: Rebecca? Hmm. - Um, I knew him a long time ago. My family moved, I don't know, when I was like twelve I think. - I met Randy when I was eight. He never really changed. Always looked the same, acted the same. - You know, he always seemed like the kind of guy who would spread himself too thin. I mean I feel like he knew everybody in school. But I couldn't really tell you anybody he was really that close to. Well, I guess you. TREVOR: Actually no, not really. - You know how everybody has those friends that you grow up with that you play video games with, and sports, and then you kind of just forget about them? Well, that's not Randy. He's - he's just not forgettable. TREVOR: Why would you say that? Do you keep in touch with him over Facebook, or? - No, not really. He's just... He's just not forgettable. I mean... he's Randy. Trevor [laughing]: He's Randy. - This is a waste of time. I'm not basing anything on the fact that you hit her with a dart. - Well, why not? DANIEL: 'Cause it's stupid. TREVOR: Alright, ignore the dart. - Alright, think about this: When was the last time you talked to Rebecca? - Probably a couple days ago. TREVOR: Okay, but where was she? Do you even know that she's home? - Yeah, she posted something on Instagram. TREVOR: Alright, but think about it. How weird is it that Rebecca comes home-- - It's not weird at all, we invited her-- TREVOR: The same time, Randy goes missing. - Alright, forget it. Let's just look at the stuff from the phone. - Okay, I think I got all the screenshots from the conversation between Randy and Vicki right here. - [air quotes] Vicki. - Right. So I'm thinking this guy got most of the content for his blog from these messages. TREVOR: Well, what about this number that they used for Vicki? PAT: I tried to call it. It's not in service anymore. DANIEL: Yeah, it was a prepaid account. There was no name attached to it. TREVOR: "Hey, it's Vicki Simmons from the Ask Vicki videos. "lol wait really... "I guess you saw my number?" Wait, like saw it where? - No idea, that's what I'm trying to figure out. PAT: Wait guys, come here. There it is. TREVOR: Is this Vicki's blog? PAT: Yeah, and he put his number on there too. For like anyone to see. - I didn't know it had comments on it. How could we miss that? TREVOR: It's alright, man. We got it now. DANIEL: We know even less now then what we knew before. I mean... it's not necessarily someone who knows Randy. They don't necessarily know us. Anyone could just go on the blog, find the number, and pretend to be her. - And anyone could've used Randy's phone to track mine. - [sighs] Right. And that could be anyone. TREVOR: All I'm saying is it doesn't make any sense. - There's weird people out there. Trevor: Yeah, but there has to be a motive. Like, what would a random person want with Randy? - I don't know. - I don't think we wanna know. TREVOR: But if it was like that, wouldn't he go after somebody weak? Like a girl or a kid? DANIEL: I don't know. TREVOR: It just doesn't make any sense. - None of this makes any sense! We know that! TREVOR: Alright, sorry. - Wait guys, there's another post on Randy's blog. DANIEL: Is he holding up any fingers? PAT: Nah, but it looks like maybe he's holding a phone. TREVOR: Again? What does that mean? - I think it means he's done giving us numbers. Print that out. - We might be out of ink. - Just print it out. - Alright, I tried all three of these numbers a bunch of times. None of them are active. - Have we tried using a different area code? DANIEL: No Pat, I didn't think about that. Why don't you let me know when you come up with one? - Hey, calm down. I'm just trying to help here. - No, what kind of comment is that? You know how many area codes there are in the country? TREVOR: Come on. Come on. [knocking] - She's not home. TREVOR: Look, I really need to talk to her. - Maybe she doesn't wanna talk to you. TREVOR: Why not? Did she say that? - [sighs] If I were you, I would just leave. TREVOR: Look no, I'm not leaving. - No. Listen. I'm gonna call the police. TREVOR: Don't call the police. MAN: I'm dialing 911 now. TREVOR: Come on, Maggie. [clattering] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Put the knife down. - Get back! Go away, okay? Please go away. TREVOR: Maggie, calm down. Put the knife down. - Have you been taking pictures of me? TREVOR: What pictures? - Have you been stalking me? TREVOR: I don't even know what you're talking about. - It's you. You're always filming. I know it's you. TREVOR: Just calm down, and we'll talk about it. - No. TREVOR: Maggie, it's okay. I'm your friend. MAGGIE: No, no. TREVOR: Okay? I'm your friend. MAGGIE: They're gonna kill me. They're gonna kill me. TREVOR: It's okay. See, it was Pat's phone. They were tracking his location. That's how they kept finding us. MAGGIE: That's so scary. I would have never even thought of that. TREVOR: How often have you gotten this kind of stuff? - I don't know. A few times a day. TREVOR: Have you told anyone? - No. Trevor, I -- please... TREVOR: Oh, okay. - I am. I'm a terrible person. - No, you're not. - When he first disappeared, I wasn't even surprised. It just felt right. I knew he was cheating on me. I think I knew it all along. I just pretended I didn't. - Don't do that. Don't blame yourself. - He was basically asking to get caught. He was always texting other people, and I just let him. - It's not your fault. - Why was I never enough for him? - It's him. He's-- - I need him back. I need him. I don't have anyone. - You have me, okay? Alright, you have me. Everything's gonna be okay. I promise. - [laughs] Why don't you say something? TREVOR: Me? Uh, no. I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kind of guy. - Oh no, no. You're not getting off that easy. - Really Maggie? MAGGIE: What? - You're holding it the wrong way. MAGGIE: [mocks] You're holding it the wrong way. - Okay. MAGGIE: Alright, Mr. Trevor, what do you love about Randy? - What do I love? I didn't say love. You said love. MAGGIE: Yeah, but you're making this film for him, right? - I guess I am. Um, well I love that he went to Minnesota, because that's how he met you, and if he hadn't met you, then I wouldn't have met you. [laughing] [knocking] - Oh, hey. - Is it okay if I crash here? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. PAT: You good? TREVOR: Oh, yeah. Yeah. PAT: She good? TREVOR: Yeah, I was just making sure. - Trevor, I think we need to take a break from all this. You know? The secret clues, the phone numbers, the maps. TREVOR: Maps? - Yeah. TREVOR: Alright, so... these are all just unsolved disappearances? DANIEL: Yeah, so they're all adult male, they all happened in the last two years. It's actually not as uncommon as you'd think. But these three ones in silver stood out to me, and I printed out their information. TREVOR: Okay. DANIEL: So in all three cases, the guy goes missing unexpectedly but they stay in communication with their family. This guy sent texts. This guy sent letters. And this guy actually had a journal that they found. But they kept saying a particular story saying as to why they left, so on and so forth And the families never accepted the stories. Sound familiar? TREVOR: Well, what happened to them? - No one knows, I mean... The communication just stopped one day. No more letters. No more texts. They were just never heard from again. TREVOR: Damn. DANIEL: Yep. TREVOR: Maybe try to contact their families. Maybe they can-- - What do you think I've been trying to do? - Dan. Dan, why don't you get some rest? I can take over for a bit if you want. - No, I'm not getting some rest. [mumbles] If you want to sleep, go ahead. DANIEL: Guys, guys. Get up. TREVOR: What's going on? DANIEL: I got something on Facebook. PAT: What is it? TREVOR: Wait, is that Randy? DANIEL: Yeah. PAT: What's it say? DANIEL: "Hey, it's me." [typing] TREVOR: [sighs] [typing] TREVOR: No, Dan. Daniel, don't. PAT: Dan, I really don't think this is a good idea. - If they want to talk, I'll talk. - Daniel, seriously. We have no idea-- TREVOR: Wait, shh, shh. Does anyone hear that? [phone ringing] - Is that... Is that coming from in here? TREVOR: Yeah. [phone ringing] - Alright, we need to get out of here like right now. TREVOR: Alright, I'm gonna get Maggie. - No, Trevor. You said that Maggie knew that Randy was cheating on her, right? TREVOR: Yeah. - And she's in there right now? TREVOR: Yeah. - Where the ringing is? What are you doing? - I'm gonna find the phone. - No, it's coming from in there. That means get out. - Just move. Just move. MAGGIE: What are you doing? DANIEL: Is that your phone? MAGGIE: No. [phone ringing] TREVOR: It's up there? [phone ringing] [ringing louder] TREVOR: What the hell? PAT: What the -- [phone ringing] TREVOR: Daniel. Daniel. - Alright, which one of you put this in my apartment? TREVOR: What? - Was it you? - No. TREVOR: Alright, calm down, Dan. - No, she shows up and then this happens. TREVOR: It has nothing to do with her, alright? Pat was the one who had his location linked to Randy's phone. That's how they kept finding us-- - But how would someone even get into our apartment? DANIEL: I don't know. I don't know, Trevor. - Trevor, I -- TREVOR: You know what, guys? Do you want to tell me what you really think? PAT: Not now! TREVOR: Maggie was afraid of me, you know. She wouldn't even talk to me. - Trevor, it had nothing to do with them. TREVOR: Guys, I know you've been talking behind my back. - I didn't talk to her. I don't even know her. TREVOR: Dan, just tell me. - Tell you what? TREVOR: Tell me what you really think. You think I'm behind all of this. - No, no I don't. PAT: You wanna know what I think, Trevor? I think you can't wait for him to get out of the way. TREVOR: What are you talking about? PAT: Maggie, I'm talking about Maggie. You're obsessed with her. TREVOR: Are you kidding me? Dude, what about you? - What about me? TREVOR: You don't care. About any of it. Randy disappearing, the blog clues, the footage we have... You don't even try. - Are you serious? Just because I didn't believe we would find him didn't mean I didn't want to. - Then please stop, and let's find him. DANIEL: We're not going to. TREVOR: What? - We're not going to find him. TREVOR: Dan, dude, come on. - No. You want to be next? You want to disappear? 'Cause that's what's gonna happen if we keep at this. - Guys, he's still alive. We can go somewhere, alright? All of us. They know where you live, but we can go somewhere else. TREVOR: Alright, you know what? Let's just leave. MAGGIE: But -- TREVOR: It's not worth it. [footsteps] DANIEL: Maggie. Did Randy even talk about us? MAGGIE: No, not really. - You know, it's funny. Even though I haven't seen him in years, I feel like everything's just gonna click, you know, like he was never gone. TREVOR: Do you have a favorite memory with Randy? - Hold on, let me think. Let me think. - I don't know. There's a lot to choose from. TREVOR: Just pick one. - Okay, this actually happened only a couple months ago. He and I were skyping each other, and uh, we were just talking about the good old days, reminiscing. And uh, I don't know. Just doing that kind of encapsulated all the good times into one. I don't know. Does that work? TREVOR: Yeah. - I don't know. It just made me -- It made me really excited to see him again. TREVOR: Hey, Maggie? We're going to figure this out, okay? Even if they don't come around, we'll figure it out. - Okay. Thanks, Trevor. TREVOR: Okay, my room's just right in here. So... No one else is here tonight. You can just sleep in there. MAGGIE: Okay. [distant knocking] TREVOR: What is that? Maggie? What time...? [click] Maggie? [knocking] - What is that? TREVOR: I don't know. Hold on. [steps creaking] [knocking] TREVOR: Just keep the light off, okay? MAGGIE: Trevor, don't answer it. [steps creaking] [latch unlocking] [door creaking] TREVOR: Aw dude, you scared the hell out of me. - Hey, I need your help. TREVOR: So you came here in the middle of the night just to tell me that the circle is where we buried the time capsule? DANIEL: Yeah, it just came to me. I'm pretty sure Randy was correct. X is the fence post. Circle would be where we buried the time capsule. TREVOR: Okay, and? - I mean, it doesn't even really matter. We know it's ten steps away from the fence post. If we just dig a perimeter around it, we'll find it eventually. TREVOR: You mean right now? - Yeah. - No, I'm not going. That's where Randy went missing. - Yeah, but that's our fault for splitting up. - I don't care. TREVOR: Well, what about Pat? - What about him? TREVOR: Why don't you just go with him? - I tried. He said he wouldn't come. TREVOR: So you just left him? - Yeah, and that's why I need you guys. - No. TREVOR: You shouldn't have just left him. I just don't get how the time capsule is gonna help us now. - I -- I just need to see it. [crickets] - Trevor, can we please go back? DANIEL: We're almost there. TREVOR: Are you sure, though? - Please, can we just come back in the morning? - Look, I am doing this right now, okay? TREVOR: Wait, do you guys hear that? - Trevor stop, please. TREVOR: No, seriously. I heard something. DANIEL: It's just an animal or something. [footsteps] TREVOR: Guys, seriously... DANIEL: Shh, shh, shh. TREVOR: Yeah, Daniel. It's getting closer. [footsteps] TREVOR: Where's that coming from? [shushing] [mumbles] DANIEL: Wait, don't move. Don't move. Don't move. TREVOR: What is that? PAT: Yo, Dan. DANIEL: [sighs] Pat, are you kidding me? TREVOR: Oh my god. PAT: I told you not to come out here alone. DANIEL: Well, I didn't, no thanks to you. - 'Cause this is insane. MAGGIE: This is dumb. This is dumb. DANIEL: We're almost there. Okay, here it is. Everyone fan out in like a ten foot radius. Start digging. We'll find it eventually. - Alright, let's just do it. - I'm gonna go this way. [digging] [scratching] TREVOR: You find anything? - No, nothing yet. Oh, Trev. Um, thanks for helping out, you know? Just filming us all. Real good work. TREVOR: Hey uh, Maggie. Do you want me to take a turn? MAGGIE: Yeah, please. [crickets] [scratching] DANIEL: Guys, guys. Get over here. TREVOR: What? Did you find something? DANIEL: Yeah, that's definitely it. TREVOR: Man, even after all these years, it was still here. DANIEL: Yep, I got it. Let's go. Let's get out of here. [plastic rustling] TREVOR: Alright, here we go. PAT: Oh, I remember this. DANIEL: Oh, and here's your damn yo-yo. TREVOR: Oh, it's Porky. It's Rebecca's old toy. [laughing] - It's one of our mixtapes. Can you imagine the kind of crap we have on this? - Throw it on. [soft rock music] - Why is this in here? - Oh, that's actually -- that's Randy's. I think his dad gave it to him. [papers rustling] TREVOR: Yeah, we all wrote letters to each other. - Yeah, you wanna read one for Randy? - Okay. [soft rock music] TREVOR: Let's see what we got. Nice. Nice, Dan. Very nice. - From the heart. TREVOR: Yeah. [laughs] TREVOR: What's that? - It's just a bunch of pictures. TREVOR: No, but what's that picture? - Nothing, it -- it's uh, me and Randy. PAT: Think this is still good? - No. TREVOR: Wait. Wait, what's that? DANIEL: I don't know. MAGGIE: It's... an old cell phone. "Decoder." PAT: Decoder? TREVOR: I think that's Randy's old cell phone. MAGGIE: This seems like a math problem. TREVOR: What the hell? DANIEL: Wait, let me see that real quick. - So what is that? Like pi written out or something? TREVOR: Mm, no, I don't think so. PAT: Binary code? TREVOR: Like zeros and ones? - Damn, how could I have missed this? TREVOR: What? Missed what? - So when Randy and I were in grade school, we used to pass notes in class and we would use numbers, so no one else could read the notes - Weren't they cute? DANIEL: You remember the old school flip phones? We'd use the T9 texting function like as our code. - Wait, why wouldn't you just text each other? - Because it cost money per text back then. It doesn't matter. We used to communicate using numbers. TREVOR: Oh! MAGGIE: Oh! DANIEL: Yes! PAT: Oh! Yeah, I still don't get it. DANIEL: The blog posts! So he knew we were digging up this time capsule. I'm thinking he was hoping that we'd make the connection between the code and the amount of fingers he's putting up in these pictures. TREVOR: Well if so, it worked. It just took us so long to dig the damn thing up. DANIEL: Yeah, right. - "7 4 3 5 8 3 7" - So basically, it's not a phone number, it's a text message. - Right. Damn, I don't know if this is gonna work. - What? - 'Cause each number can be associated with up to four letters. Like this seven... could be a P, Q, R, or S. MAGGIE: So how'd you and Randy know what letter it was before? - I'll show you. The top number meant what key it was on the keypad. The bottom number meant whether it was the first, second, third, or fourth letter associated with that particular key. PAT: Well, that's just inefficient. TREVOR: Well, maybe he's just giving us the top number. DANIEL: It could be. TREVOR: So, it's not that bad. We'll just try every possible combination. - Right. TREVOR: I mean it's only seven numbers. - Alright, so what do we got? MAGGIE: [sighs] Nothing. - I got... P -- H... E... Ph... Oh, fl -- flood? No, I don't know. I have no idea. - No, it's definitely "shelves." I'm telling you guys: "shelves." TREVOR: Okay. DANIEL: Shelves. - Shelves! Brilliant. - Well, what would "shelves" mean? - No, or it could be "shelter." S -- H -- E -- L -- T -- E -- R. TREVOR: Okay. MAGGIE: Okay, "shelter." - "Shelves" and "shelter." - No, "shelves" or "shelter." TREVOR: Shelter... Shelter! Wait! Guys, I gotta show you something. [click] [leaves rustling] DANIEL [on screen]: Yo guys, check this out. You guys remember this from before? TREVOR [on screen]: Nah. PAT [on screen]: Nope. TREVOR [on screen]: Is it on the map? - No. - Oh, well you gotta put it on the map. RANDY [on screen]: [mumbles] TREVOR [on screen]: Shh! Alright, we got a new addition to our park map here: The Shelter from the Storm. [click] PAT: Wow. MAGGIE: Do you think he'd remember that? - I mean, he remembered our code. TREVOR: This could be it guys. - We can't go out there right now. - But Randy could be there. - Yeah, he could be. But we don't know that for sure. TREVOR: Yeah but, shouldn't we go find out then? Isn't that the whole point? - Then how about we wait 'til the morning. It's still dark out. TREVOR: I don't know, man. - Look, this guy is dangerous and we don't even know if it's just one guy. TREVOR: [sighs] Daniel. - We have to go. - No, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna gather all the evidence we have and bring it to the cops. So this would be the blogs, the pictures, threats-- TREVOR: I don't know. - Your videos... I mean maybe they can actually help us this time. [papers rustling] - What about this? - What is it? - It's uh, Randy's message from the time capsule. Should we decode it? - Let me see. I really can't believe he remembered this. TREVOR: I'm glad he did. - Yeah, I just can't believe it, though. [paper rustling] - Okay, it says... it says, "By the time you read this, I will be gone." TREVOR: What? - Hold on, just listen. - "By the time you read this, I will be gone. As soon as I can, "I'm getting far away from here. "Hope you guys have fun opening up the time capsule someday, "but I'm never coming back. I hope we can somehow "still be friends... Randy." [papers rustling] DANIEL: Pat, grab that stuff. TREVOR: Is that everything? DANIEL: Yeah. DANIEL: Maggie? TREVOR: Maggie? - Where'd she go? PAT: Maggie! TREVOR: Come on, Maggie. - I'm just getting coffee for everyone. TREVOR: No, you're not. - No, you can't go out there tonight. We're gonna go to the cops together. Right now. - No, I'm not waiting any longer. PAT: But we're leaving right now. - They would have to get a warrant and whatever else, and this guy seems to be one step ahead of us. DANIEL: Yeah, exactly. That's why we need to go inside. MAGGIE: No, get off. TREVOR: Come on, Maggie! PAT: Maggie, don't. TREVOR: Maggie! DANIEL: Wait, wait wait! TREVOR: Maggie! DANIEL: Damn it! TREVOR: Pat, can I borrow your phone? DANIEL: Phone? For what? TREVOR: I'm gonna call her. - We should call the cops. - Yeah, but how do we explain to them where she is? - We have a map. [phone ringing] TREVOR: Come on, come on. VOICEMAIL: "Your call has been..." Damn, she's not answering. We have to go. We're the only people who know how to get there. Come on, guys. We can't let her go out there alone. - He's right. Alright, we've got Randy's knife. TREVOR: Okay, what else we got? Anything? - Uh, the shovel. I'll go get that. TREVOR: Okay. Crap guys, is this Maggie's phone? She left -- she left her phone. - Alright, we're just gonna have to try to beat her there. Let's go. [engine humming] TREVOR: Yeah, that's it. That's her car. DANIEL: Alright, let's just... let's just find her before someone else does. [crickets] PAT: So, what now? TREVOR: I don't know. Does anyone know how to track? - No, no one knows how to track. - Let's just go straight to the cabin. And stay quiet. [distant howling] PAT: Stop, stop. Do you hear that? There it is again. TREVOR: Wait, is anyone moving? - No. DANIEL: Maggie, Maggie. If that's you, say something. It's us. - Listen. Do you hear that? TREVOR: Yeah. DANIEL: Maggie, Maggie. [distant howling] - Just say something if that's you. It's us. PAT: I don't -- I don't think that's Maggie. Hi, my name is Patrick Burke. If anyone finds this camera... TREVOR: Pat, what are you doing? PAT: Just in case! DANIEL: Maggie. Maggie. [leaves rustling] DANIEL: Run! Run! TREVOR: What is it? TREVOR: [yelping] [crickets] TREVOR: Daniel? Guys? Daniel? [loud cricket] TREVOR: Daniel? DANIEL: Over here. [footsteps] - Dude. - Stop filming. TREVOR: Th -- that's it. DANIEL: Yeah. TREVOR: Maggie! - Shh! TREVOR: I don't hear anything. DANIEL: We're gonna have to go in there. - No, we have no idea what's in there. Or who. TREVOR: Maggie could be in there. DANIEL: Randy could be in there. - Ted Bundy could be in there. Alright, alright. Let's just go. [leaves rustling] [crickets] DANIEL: I don't see anyone. I don't think there's anyone in there. I'll go check it out. You guys stay out here. TREVOR: No, you're not going in there alone. - I mean, if you really want to. TREVOR: Pat! - Of course we're going with you. - Alright, stick together. [phone ringing] PAT: Sorry. [doorknob jiggles] [door clanging] [floorboards creaking] [banging] - Power's out. - There's nothing. There's nobody here. [muffled cries] PAT: Is that Maggie? DANIEL: No, it's Vicki. TREVOR: Wait, the real Vicki? - It's okay. We're here to help. We're the guys looking for their friend. It's okay. You gotta be quiet. - Your friend, he's in the woods. She took him there. PAT: Randy? Where'd they go? DANIEL: Okay, we're here to help. TREVOR: Okay, wait. Who's she? Who has you here? - She's some girl. I -- I don't know. PAT: Was it Maggie? TREVOR: Wait for how long? - Where's Randy? - She has dark hair. I've been here for a few days. PAT: Maggie. Is it Maggie? - We were just talking. We were just talking. DANIEL: It's okay. It's okay. We can take you there. - Just tell her that... I didn't know he had a girlfriend. DANIEL: No, it's okay. It's okay. Let's just see if you can lead the way, okay? - Okay. - Alright. - Let's get out here. PAT: Wait, she's missing a finger! [bang] TREVOR: Pat! DANIEL: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Alright Vicki, it's okay. Just calm down! - I told you not to come here. DANIEL: We're not here to hurt you-- - Oh, really? DANIEL: We're just here for Randy. Where is he? - Oh, is that it? TREVOR: Where's Maggie? - [mocks] Where's Maggie? Drop the knife! - Just put the gun down. We can talk about this. - You're testing my patience right now. [gun cocks] Do you want me to shoot him in the face? TREVOR: Alright, just... Daniel, just drop it okay? [bang] - The cell phones, too. [banging] - Trevor. [banging] DANIEL: Where'd you get that phone? TREVOR: It's Maggie's. I got it from your place. - Then stop filming and call the cops. PAT: They said they'll be here, alright? They'll be here. DANIEL: Okay. I cannot believe she had him the whole time. She had him the whole time! - We can't think about that right now. TREVOR: Alright, you think we should just leave? - No, just wait for the police. - We were talking to her. We did talk to her! - I know, Dan. Let's just wait, alright? - I'm such an idiot. I always assumed she couldn't. I just... [distant yelling] TREVOR: Wait. Is that Maggie? - Alright, hold on. - It's coming from out there. - Okay, just hold on. MAGGIE [in the distance]: Help! - That sounded pretty far. TREVOR: It's Maggie. I know it's her. - Alright, let's go. Pat, stay here in case the cops come. - The hell I am. I'm not staying here alone in this cabin. - Alright, let's go. [banging] TREVOR: Wait. Wait guys, hold on. Wait up. TREVOR: Maggie? Randy? - Trevor, shut the hell up. [leaves crunching] TREVOR: Wait, oh. Guys. Guys. - This is -- this is Maggie's, right? She was wearing this. MAGGIE [in the distance]: Help! PAT: Wh - what do we do? What do we do? DANIEL: It's this way. Come on. TREVOR: No, no, no. No, Maggie! MAGGIE: Randy? TREVOR: Oh no. PAT: Hey, hey, hey. You're gonna be fine. TREVOR: Daniel, she's gonna kill us. - This is a BB-gun. TREVOR: Daniel, we need to get Maggie out of here. No Dan, she wants us to follow her. DANIEL: I'm not letting her get away. PAT: Hey, she's losing a lot of blood, guys. Trevor, you need to stay with her. TREVOR: No, no, no. Daniel, come on. We'll go back. DANIEL: Trevor, you stay with Maggie. TREVOR: Alright, then Pat. You film. - No, that is not a priority right now! TREVOR: Alright, then you stay with Maggie! PAT: Trevor! Trevor! TREVOR: You can stay. I'll come back. [crickets] TREVOR: Wait, you see that? [leaves crunching] [footsteps running] - Randy! [clapping] - Congratulations! You found him. DANIEL: Just let him go, okay? - Uh, let me think about that... no. - Alright, I just want him, alright? Just him. Then you can go. I swear. [muffled cries] DANIEL: Why are you doing this? - Well, a girl's gotta eat, right? TREVOR: What? Dan... - And it's a shame. We were still raising him. TREVOR: Daniel. Look around, man. - Okay, just let him go. Okay? Just let him go. - Because he's a pig, Daniel. And you know what happens to pigs, right? DANIEL: No, no... - No? DANIEL: Okay, seriously. We won't tell anyone anything. We'll give you the camera. Anything. Trevor, give -- please, please. - Do you know what happens to pigs? - Vicki, please. Don't do this. Don't do this. - They get slaughtered. - No, wait. Wait, wait, wait. No, no! Come on, Randy. Come on. Stay with me, Randy. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. He's bleeding out. Come on, Randy. Trevor, Trevor. He's losing a lot of blood. Come on, keep it together. TREVOR: Daniel, we have to go. We have to go. We have to go. We have to go. [distant sirens] [heavy breathing] DANIEL: What are you doing? We gotta get to the Pat. TREVOR: I gotta get... I gotta get my phone. I need my phone. I need my phone. [tender music] - Yeah, if you're getting everyone together or whatever, that could be cool. Let me know. We could do a whole, like, class reunion or something. - You know, I see his face on my phone all the time, so it's almost like he never left. - It's kind of weird when you think about it. Like, we have all these ways to connect to each other. So, the idea of an old friend is just kind of lost. TREVOR: But do you talk to them? - To who? TREVOR: To your old friends, I mean. You're friends online, but do you talk? - I actually deleted all my social media. I feel like that stuff really consumes you. [tender music] [video chat ringing] TREVOR: Come on, man. Just answer for once. Damn it. [on screen]: [crickets] WOMAN [on screen]: This is the route I take. [upbeat music] [water running] [mumbling] WOMAN [on screen]: If you're still interested... You can subscribe to my channel. And I'll see you next time. [static] [soft electric guitar]
