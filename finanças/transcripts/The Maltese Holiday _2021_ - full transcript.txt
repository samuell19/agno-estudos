(lively music) (calm music) - Good morning, everyone, Shea here. And as you can see, I literally just woke up. (chuckles) You are about to come on the biggest sheacation ever! It's 7:35 AM here in New York and today's the big day. Me and my best friend Kristen are about to spend the holidays in Malta. (chuckles) Kristen and I have been best friends since college, and this is our last big trip before she gets married. We have some amazing stuff planned and I am bringing you with me every step of the way. So make sure to like, follow, subscribe, and keep up to date with all of my updates. (chuckles) Ciao. Good morning, sleepyhead! Wake up and call me because we are going to Malta. All right, call me back. Bye. (lively music) Hey, I haven't heard from you yet. Just wanna make sure you're up and ready to go. Uh, call me back. Bye. (lively music continues) Hey, um, it's been a little while. Just wanna make sure the car is coming and everything's on time. Uh, give me a call back. Bye. (lively music) Kristen, hey! Uh, I haven't heard from you yet. Just wanna make sure everything is okay. I'm like no excited. Call me back. Bye. (lively music) Hey, so I haven't heard from you, hope everything is okay. I don't really know what's going on. The car never showed. But it's all good, I called the cab and I'll see you at the airport. Yay, Malta! Kristen, I'm really worried. I'm in the car and almost at the airport. I'll check in and head right to the gate. We're cutting it close! Where are you? Hey, there, this video is supposed to be me and Kristen in the back of a limo drinking mimosas on our way to the airport. But as you can see, it's a little different. Kristen never showed and she hasn't answered her phone, but maybe she forgot to charge it last night or something. I'm sure she's just waiting for me at the airport. (laughs) And now I'm the one that's going to be late. (sighs) The snow this morning caused some traffic but the snow stopped and the flight's still on time. Don't worry, I'm sure I'm gonna get there on time, (chuckles) at least with enough time to check my bag and get it to gate. Kristen and I haven't been planning this trip for over a year and a half. There's no way she'll miss it. She's definitely coming. (giggles) Okay. All right. Ciao for now. (lively music) What do you mean you're not coming? Kristen, I spent more than half my savings for this trip. - I know, and I'm so sorry. Barnaby and I got into a major fight, and I can't leave. - Fight over what? - About me going halfway around the world with a single woman before we get married. - A single woman? Kristen, I'm your best friend. - I know. And I told him that. But he's my fiance, and we're getting married in a month, I, I can't leave when he's angry. - We've had this trip planned since you got engaged. You couldn't even cancel on me earlier so that I could at least try to get my money back from insurance? - Shea, I will pay you back. - It's not about that, Krissie. This was supposed to be our special trip before you get married, a once in a lifetime trip. - We can take other trips. I can't always find another husband. - I can't believe you just said that. Okay, come over and I will pay you back for everything. I'll write you a check. - Don't be ridiculous. Where are you gonna get that kind of money? - Barnaby said that he would give it to you. - No way. He hates me. - He does not! - He does! He never was gonna let you go on the trip, Krissie. - [Gate Agent] This is the last call for Flight 827 into Malta International Airport. At this time, all passengers are required to board. - I'm going. - What? - I'm still going on the trip. Have a merry Christmas, Kristen. I'll see you when I get back. - Are you sure? - Yes. You might have a fiance but all I have is this once in a lifetime trip. I'm fine going by myself. - But you'll spend Christmas alone. - I would have spent it alone anyway. My family is going on the cruise, remember? - Right, I'm sorry. - I know you are. - (sighs) Have a good flight. Let me know when you get there. - [Shea] I will. Bye. - Will you chill out? We're going to have a great time. - This is supposed to be my honeymoon, Mike - Yeah, but you can't think about that because you can't control what she did. - Just Beverly and I were supposed to be- - Can you just stopped saying her name? Because she doesn't deserve you even mentioning her. - I can't do this. - Do what? - Instead of going on a honeymoon with my wife, I'm going on it with my little bro. - Don't be ridiculous. Okay, you're getting on this plane. We have to go. - No we don't. - Yeah, we do. I already took off two weeks and I can't get that time back. - So you go. - What? - Just go on without me. You're a big boy. I think you could use the break anyway. - What do you mean? - I'll go take care of Mom. You've been with her ever since Dad died. I think it'd be good for you, okay? Just go have fun without me. - Ticket, please? - Can I just use the restroom really quick? I promise I'll be very fast. - Make it fast. - Thank you - To Malta? - Yeah. - I don't know anything about Malta. Well, neither do I. Then why were you even going in the first place? - 'Cause Be... Fine! She-who-shall-not-be-named chose it. - And you just went along with it? - I told her she could pick where we went for our honeymoon. - (sighs) This is unbelievable. - Just go, man. Go have fun for me, okay? - I don't even know what language they speak in Malta. - They speak English. (paper rustling) Here. - What is this? - It's the full itinerary. I'll go change everything in your name. (paper rustling) - Hey, guys! So I know she's not coming with me but it's okay because I have you. And I'm gonna tell you all about my Malta trip and we're gonna share the amazing experience together. So keep posted and watch my videos for more. Bye. - Hi, excuse me. - Daryl, wait! - What? Come on, man. It's just a chance for you and me to be alone on Christmas. It's been such a rough year. - You're telling me. I just want to be with Mom, okay? - No, she doesn't need you there. Angela is at home. - I need her. You don't understand, Mikey. Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to be left at the altar by her? - Yeah, I was there with you. - I can't run from this. I need to be with Mom. I need to talk to her or else I'm gonna go crazy. - So just call her. - Gentlemen, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the door is about to close. - Daryl, come on. - Mikey, will you please understand? - All right. Yeah, I get it. - Thank you. - All right, let's go. - Mike, I paid $15,000 for this trip. One of us is getting on that plane. Besides, maybe you'll meet somebody. - (panting) I'm sorry! I'm here! Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I'll just wait my turn. (whimsical music) - Fine. Yep, all right. - Hey, you're gonna have a great time, okay? - I guess. - Excuse me. Is it a problem if I'm getting on this fight? - Did you check a bag? - Yeah. - Let me help this lady out and then I'll look and see if there's an issue. - Okay, great. - Next. - Here you go. - May I see some ID please? - Sure! Is something wrong? - Your seat was assigned to a standby passenger when you didn't arrive for last call. - Can't you just give me another seat? - No, I'm sorry. The fight is completely booked. - Excuse me. I might be able to help. - How? - You can have my seat. - Excuse me? - Yeah, I'm not going anymore. - Are you serious? - It's a long story. - I don't think you can do that. Can he do that? - That's between the two of you. - Are you sure? - Very. - I can't afford another ticket. - Oh, I'm not expecting any money. I can't get a refund anyway. Go ahead. Enjoy yourself. - Thank you so much. - Enjoy your flight. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Oh my gosh, guys! You're not going to believe what just happened to me. I'm the last person to board the plane and I'm using someone else's ticket. Shout out to the handsome stranger who gave me a seat on my flight to Malta. Okay, keep following my stories for all the updates. Bye. (lively music) Okay, guys! So the guy that gave me his ticket, his ticket was for first class. I'm so excited. This is gonna be such an amazing flight. Okay, I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna just do so many updates. I'm gonna show you guys the food, the drinks, and all this kind of stuff that's- - Are you gonna be doing this the entire fight? - Um? (lively music) - All right, guys! We've been on the plane for two and a half an hours and everybody is sleeping except for me. - [Michael] Trying to do that. (jet noise) (lively music) (jet noise) - Hey, guys! Okay, so I'm in the restroom and that's because Mr. Personality didn't like that I was making videos in first class. But first class is amazing, I can't wait to tell you more about it. So stay tuned and I'll see you in Malta. Bye. - [Crew Member 1] Flight attendants, prepare for landing. - [Crew Member 2] Ladies and gentlemen, we have just begun our descent into Malta International Airport. Please return your seats to the upright and locked position and make sure that your seat belts are fastened. The flight attendants will be passing through the cabin for one last compliance check and to pick up remaining cups, glasses, and other trash. We will be on the ground shortly. (calm music) - Hey guys, I made it! I'm here in Malta. It was a great flight. First class is amazing. And I'm sorry I didn't get to share everything with you guys. The guy in 9C was just not having it. But, hey, that's the last we see of him, right? Now I have to go find my shuttle and head to Ramla Bay. I'll see you guys outside. (wheels rattling) Hey! Hey, 9C, talking to you. - Me? - Yeah. - 9C? - That's the seat you were sitting in. You never told me your name. - Okay. - Excuse me. - What do you want? - I just want to say thank you, all right? It was really nice of your friend who gave me a seat. Will you just tell him I said thanks again? - Sure. - Well, great. Well, have a great trip. I've never been to Malta. - Me neither. I was supposed to be here for the first time with my brother. - Yeah, he didn't seem like he wanted to go on the trip to begin with. - You have no idea what you're talking about. - Merry Christmas to you too. Jerk! (wheels rattling) (calm music) Malta! The airport is the city named Gudja? Guda? Hey, everyone. Here I am in Malta. The airport is in a city named Gudja? Guda? Needless to say, it was a long flight, especially sitting next to that lovely seat partner of mine. But hey, I'm here. And yes, it's raining. But after every storm comes a rainbow, right? And I'm not going to let a little rain get me down. All right, so I have an hour or so drive up to my hotel on the coast. So follow my adventures as I travel around Malta. Ciao. (giggles) Hey, oh, Ramla Bay! I'm coming! Hold on! - [Driver] Let me help you with that. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - It's so nice to know that chivalry isn't dead yet. (whimsical music) Thank you. (doors bang) You know, decent human beings usually reply with "You're welcome." - Who ever said I was a decent human being? (lively music) - Let me help you. - Thank you so much. I'm sorry, all I have is American money. - Oh, Grazzi. Thank you. Have a beautiful trip. (speaking Maltese) - Excuse me? - It means merry Christmas in my language of Maltese. (Shea speaks Maltese) Good, very good. - Grazzi. (doors bang) (serene music) - Enjoy your stay. (wheels rattling) May I help the next guest, please? (wheels rattling) - Hi. - Hello. Welcome. - Thank you. Reservation under Shea Andrews. - Yeah, right here. May I have your credit card for incidentals? - Yes, certainly. - You have a complimentary cocktail hour at the hotel bar at 5:00 this evening, should you like to join us. - That sounds wonderful. (Clerk chuckles) - And here you are. (laughs) - What is this? - Your friend arranged it for you? - Thank you. - You are in a panoramic suite, number 432. Take the stairs to the second floor, make a right, and you're all the way at the end. - Okay. Thank you. (giggles) - Hey, you're welcome. Enjoy your stay. - Grazzi. (speaks Maltese) (Clerk speaking Maltese) Oh, no, no, no. I don't speak Maltese. I'm sorry. - Uh-oh. Okay. Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. (wheels rattling) - May I help the next guest, please? (lively music) (keys tapping) (sent notification) (lively music continues) (keys tapping) (sent notification) (lively music continues) - Good evening. I am Sam. What can I get for you this evening? - Surprise me. I'm on vacation. - Huh... Oh, oh. (laughing) - 9C, how nice to see you here. - Ha-ha. Very funny. - It's looks we're the only singles here. - Yeah. And I'd like to keep it that way. - What's that supposed to mean? - And here you are. - Oh, what is this? - This is out national drink, The Maltese Falcon. (laughs) - Like the movie? - Exactly. - You do know "The Maltese Falcon" was filmed in San Francisco, right? - No, it's Malta, like the title. - Have you ever seen it? - Ah, no. - Wow, this is delicious! - Yes. You like? - I do. - [Sam] Ah! - What's in it? (Sam stammers) - The, uh, stuff dreams are made of. (Sam laughs) - Do you know what she means? - It's a line from the movie. - Oh. Hmm. (chuckles) - Hey, guys. So I'm here at the Ramla Bay Resort in Mellieha. (chuckles) It's absolutely beautiful. And I'm sorry I didn't post earlier, but I fell asleep while I was unpacking, and I had barely any time to get ready for the cocktail hour. So now I'm just finishing my drink, The Maltese Falcon, which was made by the best bartender named Sam. He was amazing. Hmm. And this drink is amazing. If you ever come to Malta, you have to order one. Promise me. Oh, and you'll never guess who is standing here. No, it is not a big celebrity, I wish, but none other than Mr. Personality himself. Yep, the guy in 9C, he's staying at my resort. I'm not kidding. Then, I'm not going to let him ruin my vacation. - [Waiter] Miss, your table is ready. - Oh, thank you. Okay. I'm gonna go sit at a table and enjoy the rest of my evening and this drink. And I promise I'll take you guys outside tomorrow. Maybe we'll go for a swim before we go on an adventure. (laughs) Okay, I'll see you then. Ciao. (calm music) (fire crackling) - For you, Miss. - Thank you, Sam. - You are so very welcome. But, why are you all alone? - Oh, it's a long story. - Ah, no husband? - Oh, goodness, no. - Ah, boyfriend? - Nope. I'm as single as they come. - You come to a beautiful country, you should have someone to share it with. - My best friend, Kristen, was supposed to be here. - [Sam] Ah! - She's getting married in a month. - Ah, congratulations! Is she in your hotel? - No, she had to cancel. - Ah, so you come to Malta by yourself? - Sure, why not? - Malta is a very romantic country. Maybe you'll find a husband here, no? (laughs) - (laughs) Is that an offer, Sam? - Oh, no. Oh no, no, no, no. I am married for 17 years. We have four beautiful children. - That's lovely. - Thank you. I just don't want you to be alone. - I'm not alone, Sam. I have you, don't I? - Oh no, no. I mean fun outside of the hotel. Malta is very safe for single women but much too beautiful to keep to herself. - I'll be sure to take plenty of pictures. - (laughs) Fair enough. Fair enough. Is there anything else I can get you? - No, thank you. I'm Shea, by the way. - Ah. (Shea chuckles) Have a good evening, Miss Shea. - You too, Sam. (tranquil music) Good morning, Sheacationers. (chuckles) I told you I was going to take a dip before I went sightseeing today. It's a little before 8:00. And let me tell ya, this jet lag is so bad, I don't know what to do. So if any of you have any suggestions, please leave it in the comments or send me a DM. I will try anything at this point. I think the nap I took yesterday really threw me off. And I thought that getting in the pool this morning before I went sight seeing would wake me up but the water is so perfect and warm, I'm even more relaxed now. So if you know me, you know that I don't know how to swim. So I'm just here on the shallow-end where I can stand, keeping it safe. It's so beautiful here guys. If Kristen were here, she would've slept in and then lay by the pool all day. Well, now we get to do what we want. So today I'm going to start off by going to Crystal Lagoon. You could only get there by boat or hike. And of course I'm going to hike so I can take tons of pictures. And don't worry, I'm going to take you along with me the entire time. Oh, it looks like other guests are getting up and starting their day. So I'm going to get out of the pool, grab some breakfast and head to the Crystal Lagoon. Make to sure to follow my stories to check it out with me. Ciao. (chuckles) (tranquil music) Good morning, 9C. - Morning. - You know, you could try being friendly. - I could. - Did I do something to offend you? - No Look, my brother was left at the altar and asked me to come on this honeymoon with him, okay? - Ouch. - Yeah. And then he decided to just leave me at the airport. - That's the guy that gave me his ticket. - Yeah. My brother, Daryl. - I see. - I don't know why I didn't follow him. - Well, maybe you're supposed to be here. - Yeah, maybe I'm supposed to be spending Christmas alone on the same year that my dad died. - I'm sorry. - Me too. I shouldn't be here. - But you are. Might as well take advantage and do some sightseeing - Alone? No thanks. - Why not? I'm alone, too. I'm going to the Crystal Lagoon today. You can come with me. - You are aware that the Crystal Lagoon has like a ton of steep rock slides and cliffs, right? - Yeah. I wanna see how high it is. I wanna climb it. - Are you gonna jump? - Oh, gosh, no. I don't know how to swim. I'm just going to take some pictures. - Have fun. - I take it you don't want to come? - No, that's a hard pass. So, what's your story? What are you doing here all by yourself? - I was left at the airport by my best friend. - Some friend. - It's not her fault, it's her fiance's, I guess. He didn't want her gallivanting around the Mediterranean with a single girl. - Someone has trust issues. - Tell me about it. I've known her since we were 15 and then this guy comes along and I can't even hang out with her anymore. - Tell her to run. Marriage isn't worth it. - Is that so? - Yeah, my brother's fiance... well, ex fiance, ran off with one of the groomsmen, his best friend from high school. - Oh, ouch. - Yeah. Well, it's not always like that. - I wouldn't know. I've never been engaged. - Me neither, but my parents had been married for 30 years. - Mine would have been married 35. - See? True love exists. - Yeah, for them. (Michael laughs) - What's so funny? - I don't know. I'm sitting halfway around the world, talking about true love would a complete stranger. - Well, you could be with some stranger checking out the sites. See you later, 9C. - Bye. (lively music) (lively music continues) Hey! - 9C! I didn't expect to see you here. - Yeah, well, someone told me I should go sightseeing. - Smart someone. - Maybe. - Come on, let me take you a picture. - Me? No. - Please? Okay, I really want you to take a picture of me but I have to set it up first. Please? - Okay. Fine. Where do you want me to stand? - Just get as close to the edge as you can. - No. I could a fall. - Can you swim? - Yeah, so? - So, what's the problem? - I don't like heights. - (laughing) Okay, just get as close to it as you can, however comfortable you are. - Is this okay? - It's fine. (chuckles) (camera shutters) - I'll just give you my email so you could send it to me. - Or you can just buy them from my website. - What? - Just kidding. Come here, look. - Wow. Wow, these are incredible. - Thanks. Okay, so you just look through here and then you push this, and it should go into focus. And if it doesn't go into focus, just turn this until it does. - Sounds easy enough. - Great! Thank you. - It's fuzzy. - How about this? - [Michael] No, I think I did something wrong. It's still fuzzy. - This? How's this? - Not really. - Okay, this? - I mean, it's a little better, but it's still fuzzy. (Shea gasps) (water splashes) Does this thing have like an auto-focus? Well, now I can't even see it at all. (suspenseful music) (water splashes) (waves splashing) (calm music) Right here. Right here. Are you okay? - You jumped in after me? - Yeah, of course. - Did you get the picture? (laughs) - No. No, I did not get the picture. (Shea laughs) (calm music) Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah. I really need to learn how to swim. - Or just don't fall off any cliffs. - (laughs) Yeah, that too. - Okay. Well, um, goodnight. - Okay. Goodnight. - Hey, 9C. - Yeah? - Let me buy you a dinner. - You wanna buy me a dinner? - Yeah, I mean, it's the least I can do. You saved my life. - Oh well, when you put it like that. - (chuckles) Down here in an hour? - Sounds good. - Okay, great. - Do you need me to walk you to your room? - No, I'm going to grab a cup of tea. My nerves are still shot. - Yeah. I think I'm gonna grab something a little bit stronger at dinner. - (chuckles) Yeah, same. - Okay. So an hour? - Yep, an hour. - Okay, sounds good. - Hey, 9C. You got a name? - Yeah. I do. (tranquil music) (coffee machine whooshing) (tranquil music continues) - Hey, guys! You're probably wondering why I looked like a drowned rat, especially since you saw me in a bathing suit earlier this morning. The truth is I don't know how to swim, I never learnt. And in the pool this morning, I was able to touch the floor and just walk. But later today that's a completely different story, and you'll never guess how it ends. So I went to the Crystal Lagoon and I was standing on the cliff taking pictures, and then our buddy 9C shows up. Like, I invited him to go sightseeing with me just to be nice. I never actually thought he would show up. Well, he did. Long story short, I was standing on the cliff and I... I fell off the cliff into the Mediterranean Sea. I don't know how deep it was. The last thing I knew, he was in the water and he saved me. I swallowed a ton of salt water. I blacked out here and there, but he saved me. But I don't even know his name. He doesn't even know my name and he jumped in after me and saved my life. (laughs) Can you believe it? It's, it's like the beginning of a weird fairy tale, maybe. Anyway, I, I invited him to dinner later. So I will report back and let you know his name. And yeah, I'm totally fine. I promise. I'm just back at the hotel. I ordered a cup of tea to calm my nerves from the fall and my impending date with 9C. And maybe he's not the jerk I thought he was. Maybe. (laughs) Okay. Ciao for now. (tranquil music) - (sighs) How's Mom? - Oh, she's fine. She was pretty upset when I came home without you. - Yeah, I can imagine. I was pretty upset when you left me at the airport. - I'm, I'm sorry, man. I just- - No, like, I get it. And honestly, I could have just left with you, so... - I wouldn't have let you. $15,000 and no insurance? Really you're doing me a favor. - I guess. - Still I'm pretty bummed out that you're spending Christmas alone. - Actually, I don't think I'm spending Christmas alone. - No kidding. You met someone? - Yeah. The girl you gave your ticket to. - [Daryl] No way! - Yeah, it's crazy. But we're staying at the same hotel. We kind of had breakfast together. - Kind of? Well, yeah, I mean, she sat at the table next to me, but tonight we're having dinner together. - Come on, seriously? - Seriously. - How'd you ask her? I mean, you've only been there a day, you're not exactly fast with women. (indistinct) - All right. She asked me to dinner? - Hmm, that sounds more like it. - Shut up! She wants me to thank her for helping her today. - Helping her? How so? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Try me. - She off a cliff into the Mediterranean Sea and I jumped in and saved her. - Okay. You almost had me going there, buddy. (chuckles) Well, funny. - I'm serious. - How high up were you? - I don't know. It was on top of the Crystal Lagoon. - Mikey, that's like 100 feet up, you could've been killed. - It was like 50 but I wasn't thinking about that. She fell in and she doesn't know how to swim. - You risked your life for this girl? - I don't know. I just didn't want anything to happen to her, Daryl. She's just really special. There's something about her. - Yeah, there must be. - I can't explain it. It's like a connection I've never felt before. She's just smart, funny, and beautiful. She's got this spirit that I just can't help but be around. - Well, you risked your life for her, so there must be something. What's her name? - I don't know her name. - You don't know her name? - No. I was planning on finding out at dinner tonight. - [Daryl] You better, especially if you're gonna be spending Christmas with her. Hello, Mikey? - Uh, yeah, I'm here. I gotta go. - Everything okay? - Yeah, love you. Tell Ang and Mom I miss them. - All right. Love you too, bro. - Bye. - Shea. - Excuse me? - Shea Andrews. - Michael Foster. - Nice to meet you, Michael Foster. But if you'll excuse me, I have to go get ready for my date. See you in 10 minutes. (tranquil music) - Are you sure you don't want to sit yet, Mr. Foster? - No, she should be down in a minute. - [Waitress] Is that her? - [Michael] Yeah. - 9C! Don't you clean up nicely? - You're not so bad yourself. - Shall I show you to you table? - Yes, please. - Follow me. - After you. - Thank you. (fire crackling) - Yeah. And the entire car full of people were just staring at me as I walked face first right into the garage door. - (laughs) How embarrassing! - I know. I told you I would top yours. Okay. So favorite Christmas ever? - Ooh, that's a tough one. Christmas is always so big in my family. - Then what are you doing here? How come you're not home? - Like I said, Kristen and I have had this trip planned since like the day after she got engaged. - Which was? - 18 months ago. - And she left you just like that? - Just like that. - How come you didn't just stay? - This trip took half my savings. I even took up two jobs to make it totally over the top. I wasn't about to walk away from that, even if Barnaby offered to pay me back. - Barnaby? - (chuckles) Kristen's jerk fiance - Anyone with that name has to be a jerk. (laughs) - (chuckles)He's a stockbroker. He really looks down his nose at me. He says I have more of a hobby really, not a real job. - But what do you do for a job, anyways? - I'm a photographer. - Really? - Yeah. Weddings, sometimes some private schools, but it pays the bills and I own my own company, so I get to take off time for stuff like this. What about you? - I'm a editor for an online magazine. - No way. I just started doing some photojournalism. - Really? I do sports editing for Fire Magazine online. - Shut up! They just used some of my photos for a story on East Coast Wineries. - Nick Housey wrote that article. - I went to college with Nick. - Wow, this is getting a little weird. I grew up with Nick. - Ooh, I'll have to get all the details about you from him. - Or you can just find out yourself. - So, what about you? What's your best Christmas ever? - I don't know. This is definitely up there in probably my top three. - A good evening to you. You telling me your wedding song and I play it for you bride. - My bride? - (chuckles) We're not married. - Not yet, eh? Perhaps your fiance. - He hasn't proposed yet. - Why not? It's so clear to see you're in love. - Are we? - Anyone can see that you are meant for each other. So tell me your song and I play so you can dance with your lady. - Um, we don't have a song. Well, not yet at least. - Oh, should we have a song? - Of course, we should. - Perhaps I play one for you. - An original song? - Yes, just for you. - Just for us? Really? - Of course. I see that your love is something special. You should have a special song for it. - Here's the deal. If you play an original song, I will get up and dance with her right here. - Oh really? - And I'll give you 20 euros. - Okay. Give me one moment. (guitar strumming) - You can't be serious. - Come on, what? - Michael, come on! - You don't wanna dance with me, Shea? - I never said that. - Come on, he's never going to be able to play an original song. I guarantee it's something you've heard before. (guitarist singing) (Shea giggles) A deal is a deal. - This is your deal, not my deal. - Oh, apparently you're my girl. Are you gonna leave high and dry standing here? (Shea giggling) - I feel like I'm in an old time movie. - We do have a bartender named Sam. - Touche. - "The Maltese Falcon," "Casablanca," I feel like nobody knows the difference anymore. - I do. - I noticed. You're gonna get me in some sort of trouble, aren't you? - I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble. - Excuse me? May I bring your dinner, please? (Shea laughs) - You know, I think this is gonna be the first Christmas I spend away from my family. - [Shea] Me too. The strangest thing will be the weather. - What do you mean? - It's gonna be hot and sunny. - So? - So, no snow. - Yeah. I'm okay with that, one less driveway I have to shovel. - I love the first snow. My neighborhood looks like a postcard. - Really? - Yeah. - You have to drive down this road, and before you turn onto my block, there are all these trees with these high branches that look like they're trying to hug each other over the pavement. When it snows, it creates this magical tunnel of white. - Wow. Are you sure you're not a writer? - (chuckles) It's how I see everything, like a photograph. - Well, the people here have been celebrating Christmas forever without any snow. Just look at the decorations. - I know. It's beautiful. It's just not... - [Both] Home. - Yeah, I get it. - Yeah, I can tell. - What are you doing for Christmas? - Well, nothing. Me and Kristen were supposed to go to some festival. - You wanna spend it together? - You mean me and you? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'd like that. - Great. - Do I have to wait until Christmas to see you? - What? - Well, Christmas is four days away. Why don't we do all the touristy stuff that we were supposed to do with Darryl and Kristen together instead? - You wanna spend your entire vacation with me? - Well, that depends. - On? - Do you wanna spend your vacation with me? - (sighs) Well... - Don't forget, I heard you on the phone with your brother. - Yeah, okay. You got me there. - Would you like to charge this to your room? - [Both] Yes. - What is your room number? - 432. - 433. - Okay. I will leave this right here. - Thank you. Shea, come on. - No, I said I was buying you dinner. - No, I'm buying you dinner. - Michael, that fall could have ended my life. - Yeah, but jumping in after you started mine. - (chuckles) You must say that to all the girls that you rescue. - No, Shea. I'm terrified of heights. But when you fell in the water, I just jumped in after you, I didn't even hesitate. I really feel like I was supposed to be on the trip to meet you. - Okay, okay. You could for the, but you have to go sightseeing with me tomorrow. - Okay. Why don't you twist my arm a little? Easy! Fine, I'll go. - [Shea] (chuckles) Good. - Shea, I have to confess something. - Yeah? - I kind of wanna kiss you. - Kind of? - Yeah, because I kind of don't. - Wow, I don't know if I should be offended right now or not. - I don't know. I just don't want this night to end but I'm afraid that if we kiss it might end in a way we're not really ready for. - I see. - Am I being too corny? - No, you're being honest. I should probably be honest too. - Oh, no. You have a boyfriend. - No! No. - (sighs) Fiance? - No! - A husband? - Oh my gosh! No! - Oh, okay. Proceed. (Shea giggling) - I don't want this night to end either, it's been one of the most amazing days of my life. - Even falling? - Especially falling. I never would have done something like that on purpose. - Yeah, I don't think I would have either. - Look, I don't know where life is gonna take us when we get back home but I wanna remember this night as being perfect. - So do I. - Good night, Michael. - Good night, Shea. - (chuckles) Good night. - Good night. - How about a hug? - Yeah. I would like a hug. Oh man, now I don't wanna let go. (Shea laughs) - All right. Good night, 9C. For real this time. - For real. Good night. (door screeching) - Good night. (door bangs) (tranquil music) (lively music) - Good morning, Miss Shea. - Good morning, Sam. - You look different this morning. - I'm not so jet-lagged anymore. - No, no, no. It's something else. You are glowing. - Glowing? Me? - If you had not told me that you were single, I would say that you were in love. - Good morning! Sorry, I'm late. Good morning, Sam. - And a very good morning to you, sir. - (laughing) What? - Uh, nothing at all. Uh, enjoy your day. - Thank you, Sam. (chuckles) - Uh, so what do you want to do today? - There's so much to do and see here. There's castles, and ruins, and natural landmarks. We could drive from one side of the island to the other. - Shea, slow down. I mean, we have plenty of time. - It's 8:30 and the sun sets at 7:00, that gives us less than 12 hours. - Well, I'm here till the 30th. - So am I. - So we have plenty of time. We don't need to rush. - You wanna spend your whole vacation with me? - Why not? - We just met. Is there somebody else that you would rather spend your vacation with? - Well- - Well, let me rephrase that. Is there somebody else on this island that you would rather spend your vacation with? - Sam seems pretty committed. - Hey! - Honestly, Michael, I don't want you to feel obligated to hanging out with me. If you don't want to come today, it's totally okay. - Who said I don't wanna come? Shea, I like you, and you're a lot of fun to hang out with. I definitely wanna get to know you more. - Okay. I'd like to get to know you too. - Okay. So, what's the problem? Let's not overthink it and just take it day by day, and have some fun. - Okay, sounds like a good plan. - And my brother has all these like excursions and tours that he can't get his money back for. And so, I mean, if there's somebody else I could probably find- - Shut up! Shut up! (giggles) Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yes.

If ever get married, I wanna get married in this very spot. - Be sure to think of me fondly when you do. (Shea laughs) (lively music) Dance with me. - We should probably get back to the hotel, reservations. - One dance isn't gonna hurt. - All right. (giggles) (lively music) (tranquil music) - Come on. The song's over. - No, it's not. - Yeah, I think it's time to head up. We both had a little too much to drink tonight. - It's Christmas Eve. We should be celebrating. - We are celebrating. - Come on, time for bed. - Ooh, bed. I like that. - Oh my gosh. Don't tempt me, Shea, please. - (chuckles) Come on, 9C. Where's your sense of adventure? - Okay. It's definitely time for some sleep. - We fit together like two puzzle pieces. - Yeah. Let's get you upstairs. - Ah, is everything all right here? - We're great. - Yeah. Everything's fine, Sam. - Uh, do you need any help? - No, no. Just charge all this to my room and I'll come down and sign it tomorrow. - Very good, Mr. Michael. Good night, Miss Shea. - Night night. (chuckles) - Do you have your key? - Yes, it's in my purse. Shoot. I forgot my purse! - Shea, I have your purse. - There it is. Oh, good job, Mikey! - Wait, what did you just call me? - I don't know. - You called me Mikey. - Oopsies. (chuckles) - My brother calls me Mikey. - What do you know? I like your brother, and cheese. Do you like cheese? - Yeah. Why are you so cute tonight? - Why are you so cute all the time? Boop. (giggles) - Here you are. - Here I am. - Do you need help finding your key? - I can do it. It's not working. - Let me help. - You dit it! - I sure did. Good night, Shea. - Carry me. - What? - Carry me or I'm not going to sleep. - Shea, you're being ridiculous. - I'm allowed one night of ridiculosity. - That's not a word. - (chuckles) Carry me, 9C. Oh, I just made a rhyme. - All right. - Yeah! - (grunts) Oh, goodness! They make this look easier in the movies. (Shea giggling) (door screeches and bangs) (Shea giggling) (Michael grunts) Here you go! - Stay the night. - [Michael] Oh, God. Shea. - Mm? - Don't ruin this. We had a good thing going here. - I, sir, am not ruining anything. - I really like you, a lot. - I like you (laughing) like a lot. - Okay but it's just... It's not going to be like this, okay? Not ever. Not never. - Am... Am I in the friend zone? - Oh no! No, no, no, no. I just... I think we both had a little too much to drink tonight. Um, maybe you a little more than me. (She giggling) Yeah, no. - So, guess what? I'm a big girl. - [Michael] Yeah? - Yeah. - [Michael] Okay. - Okay. - But not like this, Shea. Just go to sleep. - I will go to sleep if you give me a goodnight kiss. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - Just... Just down a little bit more. - Okay. - No, okay, keep going down. Just a little bit. - Go to sleep. - Okay. - Good night. - Good night. (tranquil music) (door screeching) (door bangs) - (sighs) Oh, man! (serene music) - A little bit too much last night and asked Michael to stay. (phone ringing) No, he was a perfect gentleman. I'm still wearing the clothes I wore last night. Hello. - [Kristen] Merry Christmas, Shea. - What time is it? - It's midnight. I wanted to be the first person to wish you merry Christmas. - It's 6:00 in the morning, Kris. - Oh, right. Sorry. Are you alone? - Of course I'm alone. I just woke up. - Oh, I thought you and Michael might have... You know. - No, I had too much to drink. - Well, Barnaby and I moved fast and look where it got me. - It wasn't for lack of trying on my part. - What do you mean? - I drank a little bit too much last night and asked Michael to say. - And he didn't? - No, he was a perfect gentleman. I'm still wearing the clothes I wore last night. - Oh, well... - Well? Well what? - Oh, nothing. Nothing, really? - [Shea] Krissie, what? - Well... No, nothing. I'm sure he's totally in to you. - What would make you think otherwise? - (sighs) Well, you asked to say and he didn't. - Because I had too much to drink and he didn't wanna ruin things. - Do you think he has a girlfriend and felt guilty? - What? No! What makes you think that? - Well, you've just said you've known him less than a week. She, look at you. You're a catch, you're hot, you're smart. Why wouldn't he jump all over you over? I mean, even just to, you know, lie next to you and do nothing. - You don't know him, Kristine. - You just said that you've known him less than a week. - Still. - Shea, you're my best friend. I just wanna protect you. If I was there with you, none of this would be happening. - But you're not, Kris. I mean, it's been so great with him, it's just like a fairy tale. - Fairy tales aren't real. What are you gonna do when you come home and he isn't he who or what he says he is? It's gonna break your heart. - You're doing a great job with that yourself, Kris. - Shea, I'm just being realistic. When you think about it, you don't really know him. I mean, he could have made up everything that he told you. We live in a scary world. If I were you, I would just come home. - I can't believe you're ruining my trip like this. - I'm sorry. I, I feel responsible for everything. I mean, what if he has a wife and a baby back home? Will you say something, please? - Merry Christmas, Kris. - Uh! (serene music) (door knocking) - Merry Christmas, Shea! Ho-ho-ho! Time for Christmas breakfast. (door knocking) Shea, you up? (door knocking) Shea? Shea! Shea! Hey, Sam! - Merry Christmas, Mr. Michael. I didn't see you leave with Miss Shea this morning. - Oh, wait, you saw Shea this morning? - Yeah, she checked out. - She checked it out, when? - A few minutes ago. - Where is she? - Outside waiting for airport taxi. - Okay. Oh, um, you know that surprise I wanted to set up tonight? - Yes, sir, sure. - Could you like set that up like right now? - Now? - Yes, right now. - Hmm. Yes, sir. Sure, Mr. Michael. - Thanks, Sam. Hey! Shea! - Michael? What are you doing? - Me? What are you doing? - I ruined everything. I'm going home. - No! You can't. - I made a complete fool out of myself last night. - No, you didn't. - I did. I never drank that much, ever. - Shea, relax. I drank too. It's fine. - Not as much as I did. - So? If I did, then we would both regret it. Shea, we all make mistakes. - Yeah, I feel like I made a lot of them this trip. - So have I. I treated you terrible when we first met, remember? - I feels like a lifetime ago. - Yeah. And you forgave me. Give you another chance. - I was just such an idiot last night. - Shea, I jumped off a cliff for you. Please, don't leave. (tranquil music) - Michael, I have to- - Shea, I'm falling in love with you. - What? - You can't leave because I'm falling in love with you. (tranquil music) Will you please say something? - Can you help me with my bag? It's kinda heavy. - Yeah, of course. Yeah. - Going to the airport? - Not today. Merry Christmas. Michael? Michael? - He's at the restaurant terrace, Miss. - Thank you. What's going on? - Merry Christmas, Shea. - Did you mean what you said outside? - I did. I do. I know it's only been a week but I feel like we've known each other our whole lives. - I feel the same way. I just felt stupid saying it out loud. - Yeah, well, one of us had to say this, right? Look, I don't know where this is going to go when we get home but I definitely wanna see it through. I mean, I've never started a relationship on a honeymoon first, right? - (giggles) Neither have I. - You're so smart and you're funny. - And pretty? - You're definitely pretty. And we fit together like two puzzle pieces. - I said that when I was- - Yeah. And I'm saying it now. - It's a good line. - Yeah, I know. I told you you should be a writer. - I meant it though. I've been thinking about it all week. I guess I just needed some liquid courage just to say it. - Yeah. Well, you said we were supposed to be here but I think that I was supposed to come on this trip just to meet you. - What in the world? - I thought I'd bring you a little piece home for Christmas. (lively music) - Do you, Shea Andrews, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold in sickness and in health for as long as you both shall live? - I do. - [Minister] And do you, Michael Foster, take this woman as your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold in sickness and in health for as long as you both shall live? - I do. - By the powers vested in me by the government of Malta, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss your bride. (audience applauding) - Looks like you're stuck with me forever, 9C. - I'm okay with that. - I introduce to you today, Mr. and Mrs. Michael Foster. (audience applauding) - I'm the reason they're together, you know. - Are you? I actually left Shea at the airport right before our trip. - Yeah? Oh, I left Mikey at the airport and gave Shea my seat. - Hmm. Well, that's good. - Yeah, I know. They're gonna name their fist kid after me. (Kristine laughs) You're the friend that canceled the trip because of the fiance, right? - Argh, don't remind me? - How's that going? - It's not. - Oh, well, I hear Malta is a great place to fall in love. - Is that so? - Hmm.
