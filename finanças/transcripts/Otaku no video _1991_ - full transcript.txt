What we should do is start our own company... We'll start small... ...and get some licenses. We'll make sure our product is well-packaged... ...and we should sell it to wholesalers as well.

Years as an Otaku: 13. What is a Garage Kit? A garage kit's a little different from other Otaku hobbies. The others don't have a real creative aspect... ...but garage kits are different. With garage kits, you can express... ...your own sensibilities and feelings for a given character... ...in your own par- ticular way. With other things, you just collect them, and that's the end of it... ...but with garage kits, you not only have to buy and collect them... ...you have to put your heart and soul into building and maintaining them. It's totally different. As far as the creative aspects are concerned...

That's what's known as ''full-scratch.'' Amateur makers will make molds and sell copies of these. Umm... Well... Yes, well... It's also different in that you're always trying to see how far you can go... ...in expressing your feelings for a given character. How are they different from plastic models? Plastic models are an industrial product, so there are lots of restrictions. Garage kits are different... Oh, how can I put it...? Well... even though they are both kits to be assembled... ...with garage kits, you try to put your heart and soul into the construction. For that reason, there are lots of character kits. When it comes to girl characters, I put more effort into the ones I like best... ...and into the parts that I like best as well. Can you build a model anyway you like? Eh... If I'm not happy with a store-bought kit... ...well, chances are I'll trash it, leaving only the body... ...and build the rest from scratch. You can buy something like this at any store... ...but I can fool with it a little, remodel it... ...and make it more like the kind of girl l'd like. ln other words, this doll is the kind of girl I currently like. Is it fun? Yes, it's fun. Sooner or later, I think people will stop buying kits in stores... ...and start building everything from scratch, all by themselves... ...yeah, just like I'm doing. An exclusive girlfriend... the perfect girlfriend... But she's just a silent, cold-skinned doll. This man bears the burden of the sad contradiction that is the garage kit. Just what does the public think about these garage kits? Just what does the public think about these garage kits? As you can see, garage kits are not yet widely known. It has not yet achieved the same status as more mainstream hobbies. However, as a method of expressing one's devotion to the fullest... ...and as an ultimate hobby demanding a high level of technical skill... ...it is not an exaggeration to say that it will probably catch on in the future.

In other words, there's a need to strengthen our efforts... ...in self-licensed and original products. If only we had a solid concept... There's a project in the works that has already been submitted... ...to Managing Director Tanaka. Are you acting on it? Yeah. We've already contracted for a Y30-billion bank loan this year.

To be sure, soft vinyl does have disadvantages... ...like changing shape over time, and being difficult to work with. But I think that customers will, from now on... ...want completeness, rather than ease of alteration, in their models. With soft vinyl, we can make the kind of large-scale kits that... ...we couldn't make with casts. I also think this can become the new product that sheds... ...the heavy, bulky image of garage kits. But what about the problem of paints? Normal paints won't stick to soft vinyl. We'll market special paints through the same sales channels as the kits. We'll not only sell the product... ...but also the whole culture the product possesses! We can have consultants at all our stores to demonstrate... ...new techniques to customers. All right. I'll talk with group leaders. You keep working on it. There's no doubt that soft-vinyl kits will be a revolutionary product! If they aren't, there'll be no point in doing them!

PORTRAIT OF AN OTAKU Shon Hernandez (Pseudonym) Born 1964. Missionary. Years as an Otaku: 6. I think I was about 21 when I first developed an interest in Japan. It all started when my friend from Portugal showed me a book... ...I think ''Animec'' was its name. When I saw it, I remember experiencing a severe culture shock. That was when I began to want to come to Japan... ...to learn about, and preach about this beautiful and wonderful thing... ...to the unknowing people of the world. I felt that God had commanded me to do this work. How did you feel when you first came to Japan? Fantastic! The reason I live in a place like this is to cut down... ...on food and living expenses, so I can save and use all my money... ...including what I amassed before coming to Japan... ...by selling all my US possessions... ...to buy and collect Japan's splendid books and other merchandise. Unlike American cartoons and comics... ...Japanese anime has taken a totally different evolutionary path. The beauty of the characters, the power of the Gundam robot... ...it is all something to be admired. I am therefore willing to devote my life to this culture. Do you have a character that you particularly like? Well, I was really surprised that what Americans call ''Satan...'' ...which, I understand, is called ''Oni'' in Japan... ...was turned from a scary concept into a cute girl called ''Lum.'' That has to be the best character. Like they say, it's the devilish nature of women that makes them fascinating. They labeled a beautiful woman with a keyword like ''Oni...'' ...and used it to give the fans a modern take on traditional Japanese stories. I am always fascinated by these clever Japanese techniques. Can you imagine an American drawing a devil-girl or a Kerberos-lass? Are you happy? No, I am not. Why couldn't I have been born in this golden land? Without regard to their nationality, race... ...or status as illegal workers on tourist visas... ...we interviewed some foreigners at random. The results are shown here. Surprisingly, more than one out of two... ...or over 50% of the people we interviewed... ...had, in some form, been baptized into the Otaku subculture in Japan. And over half of these people either ''like'' or are ''not opposed'' to it. Recently in America, there has been a boom in ''Japanimation'' and manga. How will the Otaku culture affect future Japan-US relations? Banner: ''To Celebrate China Factory Completion!'' Sign: ''Japan-China Friendship Party'' Sign: ''Japan-China Friendship Party'' Cheers! Completion of the GP China Factory It's me... What?! An emergency board meeting?! Sign: ''Conference Room Two'' You're... Mr. Kanda, of Tozai Bank! Right on schedule. Shall we begin? We'll start by introducing a motion for President Kubo's dismissal. All in favor, raise your hand. W...What?! By majority vote, the motion is seconded. Tanaka! What's the meaning of this?! Moving on, all those in favor of President Kubo's dismissal... ...please raise your hands. This is crazy. By majority vote, President Kubo has been dismissed. Hold on a minute!

No matter what anyone says, I won't let you get away with it! Guys! What's the matter with you? Why are you falling for this ploy? G...Guys... Mr. Kubo... We have arranged a new posting for you.

PORTRAIT OF AN OTAKU Akabori Osamu (Pseudonym) Born 1972. Culinary School Student. Years as an Otaku: 9. See... this is called ''Cybernetic High School.'' See, see? Isn't Hiroko cute? Well, basically, it's a quiz game. It's a quiz with... hold on a sec. Yeah, mostly it covers anime and special-effects films. Oh... Damn, hold on... Do you ever admire the blue sky? Yes, well, I don't go outside much. I don't like to sweat and stuff. How do you take care of your sexual needs? Well, I like computer games. It's good when the girls are cute. Er... Don't you think Hiroko's cute? There's been a lot of adult stuff lately, you see... ...and I'm a fan of all that stuff. See... See... Is she cute... or what? Ah, hold on a sec... Look, look, look... Well? Do you like her? I really like her like this, you see... Er, well... Uh, um... uh... Don't you think what you're doing is indecent? Ah... Um... I guess I do, now that you mention it. But I don't worry about it. Have you ever thought about having sex with a real girl? Well, uh, you know... Don't you think Hiroko is pretty? One of the noticeable traits of the Otaku is that... ...they often talk to themselves. This graph clearly shows that this is indeed the case. The most important thing is a world of their own... ...a world within the heart, which no one else can intrude upon. There, even today, Otaku will converse alone. Go and dream your dreams there... Goddammit! Maybe I should just go home... ''GP Announces New Product'' ''Explosive Popularity Beginning With Pre-Orders'' ''Garage Kit Boom Re-Ignites'' ''Approved at Soviet Conference'' Damn, damn! So careless of me to come this way... Tanaka! Tanaka! Forgive me, Kubo! I was a fool! What in the world happened to you, Tanaka? I was being used by the bank guys. As soon as you were out of the picture, they threw me out like a bag of trash. I was framed for embezzlement, then fired without any severance pay. Now I'm living hand-to-mouth, a day at a time. And yet, old habits are hard to break... ...and so, before I knew it, here I am at this store. Tanaka... why don't we start from scratch, all over again. Kubo! You mean you'll forgive me?

PORTRAIT OF AN OTAKU Murayama Akira (pseudonym) Born 1964. Unemployed. Years as an Otaku: 10. Years as a cel thief: 6. What is a cel thief? Like the name says, it's a thief who steals cels. I also steal designs and original art, but mostly, I steal cels. I also steal designs and original art, but mostly, I steal cels. I also steal designs and original art, but mostly, I steal cels. Yeah, it's really easy. Yeah, it's really easy. Animation companies are usually open 24 hours a day... Animation companies are usually open 24 hours a day... Animation companies are usually open 24 hours a day... ...so you can just walk in, say ''Good Morning,'' and score. No one at the companies remembers the faces... ...of all the subcontractors' production- advancement people... ...so there's no worry at all about being suspected. Well... I sell the goods within my own in-group or at secret swap meets. I make copies of the design sheets... ...and sell them at Comic Market for some serious money. Do you consider yourself a criminal? Well, there are guys who, even knowing that they're stolen... ...buy and hoard cels like they're treasures. Since that's the way the world works, I say, ''so be it.'' And there's also a code in stealing. I make it a point never to steal cels that haven't been shot yet. If I did that, it would slow the production of animation that I want to see. I'd never do that. Naturally, I don't plan to quit. This is my livelihood. I think as long as there's a demand, there'll be a supply. Definitely. Not all Otaku are just. lf there's an Otaku who'll follow his dreams... ...there's an Otaku who'll feed on those dreams. Unfortunately, this graph shows that this is all too true. When a desire exists, people will do anything to satisfy it. This emotion is strongest in an Otaku. Even acts such as committing crimes become mere trifles. Video software? Right! We'll make our own videos and sell them. If we make them original, the copyright's ours. Then we can sell books, kits, or whatever we want. But Tanaka, how are we going to do this? It costs hundreds of millions of yen to make a movie. I have an 8-mm camera. Eight-millimeter?! Tanaka, do you think we can make anything worth selling with that? Kubo, Otaku think different! Of course! If we were able to sell garage kits, then why not garage videos? That's right! We'll start off with some sure-fire anime. We can use home VCRs to make the copies. Then, we'll do mail order through the magazines... ...and at screenings, we'll sell merchandise. How about it, Kubo? Once again, all that lies beneath the heavens will be ours! Hold on, Tanaka! Who's going to do it? Neither one of us can draw! Have no fear. Anticipating this, I secretly contacted someone... Oh! You're... ...Miss Fukuhara! But why you? Even though she was on the enemy's side for a while... ...in her heart, she felt closer to us. Umm, if I'm a bother, I'll... No, of course you're not! With you on our side, we'll have the strength of a thousand! I'm counting on you! Sure! Miss Fukuhara... Miss Fukuhara... Did you bring ''it?'' Yes! Please take a look at this. This is Marchen Doll Maki, isn't it?! Wrongo! You're losing it, Kubo! But... She may look similar, but she's a little bit different. Tanaka... The same person drew it, so naturally it looks similar. But this time, there's a story that goes along with it. The main character, Satsuki, is a quiet girl who's always being picked on. But when she gets hold of her baton... Wow... ...she changes into the Super ldol, Misty May! Best of all, she lacks Marchen Doll Maki's greatest weakness! Maki's weakness? What's that? Mascots! Mascots?! Correct! Stuff for girls always has mascots... ...as they are cute comic relief and important co-stars. Therefore, we have... Posi-King and Nega-King! Posi-King...? Nega-King...? I like it! I like it!
