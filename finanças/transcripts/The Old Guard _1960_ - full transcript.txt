Bloody hell! Look at the state of this bike! What the hell has he done to it? I only sold it to him 30 years ago. I thought it would be in good hands. Right. I'll let the oil soak in and finish it later. Damn this drought! It's convicts' work by rights. But who else is going to do it? The priest? Sure! Come on, put your back into it. It has to be done. This is thirsty work. Time for a drink. What do you keep stopping for? I'm expected at 6. If I'm not there by 6.10, I'll give you what for. And remember, at my age, there are no holds barred. Let's go. Your clock's slow. No, old Guillaume's fast. He's the bell ringer. He's strict about meal times. He lives 15 minutes away, so he rings the bell early. But once you know... Well, we wouldn't put up with that where I live. Then why don't you stay there? Do we ask you what time your bell rings? Eh, Blaise? We don't come bothering you. We don't give a damn. What's their problem? We're too old to put up with criticism from outsiders. Don't upset yourselves. He was just kidding. We make our own jokes, and we don't need strangers here. Right? Good. They don't really mean it. Is that the bus? No, I know that racket. It sounds like family. What did I tell you? - Evening, everybody. - Evening. Glass of wine, Louise. What are you up to, Dad? What about Germaine and the pigs? All in good time. Dinner's at 7. Don't make us come and get you. The soup might get cold. Tell him. - Well, go on. - Tell me what? Baptiste Talon's coming back. He's due any time now. - Baptiste Talon with the field? - Yes. Jean the Cartwright's son? Yes, the one who was drafted in 1917. He's no coward, either. Back in 1912, when Blaise and I were a lot fitter, we had a hell of a time together, drinking and dancing. Those were the days! You can say that again. Look out! As if two of them weren't enough. I don't remember him. What's he coming back here for? - I thought he was a railwayman. - So did I. He's retired. - Make way for the youngsters. - What for? They just push us old ones aside. We're lucky they don't kill us. "Off to the scrapheap you go." Just remember, dinner's at 7. Don't make me drag you by the scruff of the neck again! Goodbye. See how that cretin speaks to me? The other night, he even hit me. - He did? - Right. Your son beats you? Aren't you overdoing it? He treats me like an old codger, and I don't like it. He'd like me to go to bed early with a herbal tea. And at meal times, they dilute the wine like I was a kid. I can't help it if I'm 65 years old. You're a proud grandfather. Yes, surrounded by ankle-biters! Little troublemakers. Whenever I catch one, I pinch him. - They deserve it. - Too true. Respect where it's due. Just because we're old doesn't mean we're senile. Say... Talon was married, wasn't he? Maybe we'll see his wife. That's right, I'd forgotten. He's sure to have his wife in tow. That changes everything. Just between us, Adèle Talon was a real looker. That's true, but don't judge a book by its cover. It won't take much to upset her. There's the bus. Come on, old son it's him! That's the last time I travel in that old crate! Where's my luggage? If I'd taken the train, I could've stretched my legs and gone to the toilet. Why didn't you, then? And rude into the bargain! You can't judge by appearances. If it looks, swims and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck. Same goes for losers like you. Bravo! - Well said, Baptiste. - Do you know who I am? He just told me. - Sergeant Talon. - Petty Officer Péjat. Officer 2nd Class Poulossière, 43rd Regiment. Wake up the dead! They shall not pass! Victory is ours! Up and at them! This calls for a drink! - Shall we? - Of course. My luggage. Where's your wife? We were hoping to see her. Don't talk to me about that bitch! Never again! And the rail company fired you. Don't talk about that, either! - We'll have to talk about something. - Eh? We'll have to talk about something. I tell you this: they threw me out like a rusty nail. I was a victim of the bureaucrats. - The what? - Bureaucrats. 25-year-old engineers have ruined everything. The network's being run by kids! I'm just glad I'm not there to see it. Look out, lads, Talon's here. Here's our table. Louise, a bottle of the good stuff. And turn the lights on. Hi, Baptiste. He doesn't remember us. - Ah, Léon. - Yes, hello. - Bouillon. - Junior? Bleuzet junior. So, you're retired, then? - Back home for good? - Well... Not exactly. We're all happy to see you, anyway. You've no reason to complain. You're retirement age, after all. It's not about age, it's about fitness. Speaking of which... How's your health? BP 140, if you don't upset me! Razor-sharp reflexes and a brain like new. - Jean-Marie, you're impartial... - Oh... - What? - I spent 35 years driving from Pithiviers to Etampes and back! Every single day. Know what that adds up to? 10 times round the world. Travel's good, you get to see the world. Yes, there's a lot to see. My wife and I talk about it a lot. We'd have liked to see the Angkor temples. It's a rare sight. Especially between Etampes and Pithiviers. No offence, Etienne, but idiots like you are rare, too. Cheers. - Nice people! - I've not talked to them in 4 years. They drove me crazy. - Grandfather! - Here comes the cavalry. Mum says come home. You little brats... Have some respect! I told you not to go out at this hour. They seem well brought up. Hands off my luggage! - What do we say? - Thanks. Thanks who? If you have to beg, give it back! Get out of it. - Say, Baptiste. - Yes? - What did you mean? - When? When Einstein asked if you were back for good, you said: "Not exactly". That's a bit vague. Right. Since you brought it up, let's talk about it. You both have homes. You have a family, God help you. And you have your grotty shop. I have no ties. What about Adèle? I've kicked her out. Out of my bed and out of my memory! I don't want to hear her name! Then where will you go? To Gouyette. - What? - To Gouyette? That's what I said. The old people's home? You're nuts! It's worse than prison. 10 years ago, maybe. But not any more. Now it's all mod cons, with central heating, games room and running water. - And wine with every meal? - I'm not stupid. I checked: a litre of wine with lunch, and a half with dinner. Where did you hear all this? From Malvoisin, an ex-railwayman. He's been working at Gouyette for 3 years and we write. He's been begging me for months to apply with his recommendation. I'd have my own room. Malvoisin knows people there. But it's for old people! What would you do there? We're older than you, after all! I can't go to the orphanage. If you're in a hurry to die, that's your business. But why did you come back here, then? Well? I came on business, to collect the arrears on my field. That's right, you own the field behind my place. Exactly. Blaise, I'm a little surprised you've paid me nothing for nearly 4 years. Why are you making that face, Blaise? Oh... Old son, I'll be honest with you. - I hope so. Hello, Mariette. Hello, Madame Louise, Mr Péjat. Hello, my lovely. Grandad, dinner's on the table, so hurry. I'm paying homage to an old friend, Mr Talon. - My granddaughter, Mariette. - Are you coming? First, tell your father I don't like soup. Second, I'm not at his beck and call, and third... You're asking for another slap, Blaise. Then say I'm on my way, but only because I'm hungry. They don't know I'm here. Pretend you're being good. She's right. I said she's right! My favourite, my beauty! I never pinch her. What are you mumbling about? Out of all your grand kids, Mariette's the one I'd pinch! You pig! Hear that? He's just an old lecher! I heard. I'm not a man who likes to pinch. But if I was... There! Bloody hell! You're as bad as each other! A pair of old rams! I'm not wasting any more wine on you. - I'm leaving anyway. - Oh, no you're not. Not till we've finished talking. - What were we saying? - I don't remember. I do. You were being honest with Baptiste. Yes, honest is right. - About what? - His field, maybe. - Know what goes on there? - No. Every Sunday, a bunch of mongrels play football there. Yes, old son. Football's played on your grass. Did you know about this? He'd have to be there to know, which is not the case. That's down to my age and my rheumatism. Times have changed and we're all getting older. That's true. Once Anselme was old enough to beat me up, he took over the running of the house, selling the pigs, bringing up the kids... Never mind that. He no longer consults me. I'm living under Hitler! Sometimes I wish I'd died at Verdun in the flower of youth. Of course, you weren't there. Bang, bang, bang! I did my bit. Don't change the subject. I shouted the house down when Anselme said he was sub-letting the land. He wanted to be on the council. The Mayor wanted a football pitch, and that was the end of it. Come on, lads. The wine's on me. Make them large ones. It's the least you can do. Poulossière, you're a thief, plain and simple. Fine. Three half-litres. They're knocking it back. Right. Tomorrow I'll go to the town hall. I may even prosecute. I'll give them hell! No, you won't. Tomorrow's Sunday. Monday morning, then. Monday's the snail fair. You still pig out on those crunchy slugs? If that's the attitude you've come back with, you belong in Gouyette. - So you say. I've only ever missed 5 snail fairs: in 1914, '15, '16, '17 and 18. There were no snails in the Dardanelles. I didn't stop at Verdun, unlike some loafers! Who're you calling a loafer? Some of us were being shelled while you were fooling around! You can't compare your mud baths to my exploits! I swear to God, I'll swing for you! - And I'll smash this in your face! - Just you try it! - You old soakl What's going on here? We're just talking with Talon. You call that talking? I might've guessed it was you. What's it got to do with you? Dinner's ready, and I'm gonna kick your head in! - Some respect you've got. - I have to run this family. - Family of crooks. - I've had enough of this. Save your breath for the courtroom. That'll teach you to play football on my field! It's a pathetic sight. A man who laid down the law 20 years ago... - Is Anselme still as wild? - Sometimes he's even worse. Last year he kept him locked up for a week. Blaise stripped naked in the wash house and wanted the priest to baptise him! Louise! Let's settle up. Why sleep at Louise's place when you can sleep at mine? You're too kind. You'll sleep like a baby. Better than in Gouyette. Come and help me put this stuff in the workshop. It upsets me you wanting to live with the nuns. - Did you have a visitation? - I've got no-one. Me neither: I'm a bachelor. And Blaise is a widower. How come a handsome man like you never married? It wasn't for lack of opportunity. First I was too young, then I was too old. So it was age that saved you every time. You were lucky. How long has Blaise been a widower? Since Marie drowned at home, in the pond. She was soaking a willow twig, slipped and fell in. Some say that, and others that she was pushed. But by whom? By whom? Who knows? Blaise wasn't that happy with her. Maybe he lashed out. Grab that end. If Anselme decides to soak any twigs, he'd better not lean over too far. Blaise torments people. Maybe he did it. But listen, all this must stay between us. Don't mention it to him. You see, I trust you. I say that in case you have anything to tell me. Nothing. Nothing at all. Really? Then why did you get so upset when we mentioned your wife? If I was in charge of cholera, she'd be dead already! There you go again. Why not get it off your chest? Listen, Jean-Marie. I'm going to tell you a secret. Swear you won't repeat it. Of course I swear. On Poulossière's life. In Pithiviers, there was a real swine of a station master... Cuckolded by a station master? Now I've heard it all! Even when he was 20, he never had our way with women. We were like rabbits. Rabbits get myxomatosis. Blaise, everything I've told you... Swear it. On Talon's life. The beasts are unleashed. Just look at that mob! They're churning up your field, old son. Your grass is taking a real beating. This'll be the death of me. They're even cheering them on! Let the youngsters have their fun. Better here than at the bar. They're in the fresh air. Last year, between the 2 centre forwards, 2 midfielders and the goalkeepers, there was one broken tibia, a broken kneecap and a case of pneumonia. You don't get those drinking beer. Bloody hell! There is a Jesus, boys! Their ball can eat grass. Can we use yours? It's deflated. Somebody fetch it. We've lost 2 minutes' play already. Fetch the ball! Hey, Péjat, someone kicked the ball too hard. Well, go on! This won't take long. We're sorry but our ball fell in here. Can we have it back? Your ball is confiscated until further notice. What? I said we confiscated your ball. We'll see about that. What's going on? Did you hide the ball? I warn you, I'm a federal referee. - Are you English? - No. Then you're nothing but a beanpole in shorts blowing a whistle. Go put some long pants on. Will you give it back or not? No, we don't want to. Then we'll fetch it ourselves. Come on. Do I need to yank your ears? Fetch that ball, and be quick about it! What? If it isn't here, we'll check his junk room. Anyone who comes in here will be shot like a rabbit! I'll line my coat with the lot of you! Don't give in, Jean-Marie. The law is on your side. That's right! Hey, guys, they shoved it down the well! That's not good. How'll we get it out? Shit! My drill bit's snapped. Change it, then. I don't have another. Don't say we have to talk to the old codger again. Remember the fuss he made last year? Seems we have no choice. Say, Mr Péjat. I was expecting you, gentlemen. Let's go. A broken drill bit's one thing. But I say bad workers always blame their tools. I tell you, it takes 20 or 30 years to learn how to use a hand drill. Then again, it's not your fault. There are no good workers any more because of social security. These days they take sick leave for just a cold. The slightest thing and they send them to a spa. If my drill bit has lasted 40 years, it's not by chance. Sure. Let the dancing begin. What's wrong? What are you thinking about? My grandfather. Dad hid his clothes so he can't go out. - Good! - How would you like it? You say that because he's your grandfather, but he really is unbearable. We're getting married on Saturday, so get used to him. So, Saturday's the big day? - Yes. Good evening, Mr Piolet. - Good evening. Come on, kids, enough. You should be in bed. The snail hiding in the foliage... So should you. - Evening, Mr Piolet. - Evening, kids. Shut that door! I was walking along by the woods, when I came upon a huge pair of antlers. I shot him right between the ears, but he kept on going. Shut the door! I watched him. There was a dead end on the left. I took my time, I aimed and I shot him. I should've nabbed him, but he kept going. They found him 3 km away. Old Gobineau brought him to me. - The same one? - You'll have to ask old Gobineau. Did your hare talk before it died? Very funny. Long live the old guard! Long live snails! Hup! - You'll lose your nuts doing that! - I've been to hell and back. Louise, 3 half-litres. They put me to bed, then left. They hid my hat and my boots, my coat, my underpants... So I jumped out the window, onto my bike. - Put these on. - Scared of my crown jewels? Scared you'll catch cold. Don't touch. Go easy, it's the strong stuff. - As if that bothers us! - Louise, more muscadet. Hey, kids, I didn't come here to sleep. - I'm going for a dance. Coming? - What? You're going dancing when you're practically in mourning! What would Marie think if she saw you from up there? True, I'm still grief-stricken. It's been hard. Just ask him. Sometimes I still wake up screaming. That's how it is with murderers. Why do you say that? Take no notice. Being locked up sent him nuts. A grieving man shouldn't be dancing. As for me, that's another matter. Yes, cuckolds can dance. What? Did you tell him about that bitch? I'll rip out your tongue, you blabbermouth! And you said I killed my Marie! You'd have me on the guillotine! That's enough! I told you to keep it to yourself! Know what you are? A traitor. - A what? - A traitor. That makes two of you. You swore to keep quiet, too, and on his life to boot. A murderer's life doesn't count! You know where you can stick it! Have you quite finished? - Shut up! - What's it to you? - Keep out of it! - Louise! Call the local police. Never mind the local police, call the riot squad! Hey! Do you hear that, lads? If we'd known how they'd treat us, we'd have lost deliberately. Lost what? The Great War! I built the hall, I'm not paying! What's going on? What? Don't you like my tuxedo? Do I need a frock coat to get in? - I'm clean. - Your tickets. - Which one are you going for? - I'm waiting for a waltz. So am I. It's my specialty. Ah. This might be one now. Damn! - What the hell is this? - It's a boogie-woogie. It's no fun any more. In our day, music was On the Beautiful Blue Danube. Now it's just a racket. What's more, everyone here is young. Those of us who knew the '20s still are. Sorry to disagree, but I'm having a lovely time. I'm as drunk as a skunk. All right? Mr Mayor, what a crowd! I'll have a job to hang up my coat. Think it can take the weight? You'd need a typhoon to shift that! It was built by Péjat. It may never come down, except under canon fire. - Are you hurt? - No, darling. Old son! Built by Péjat is right! My watch is broken. We'll just put it back up. Give us a hand, it's heavy. Heavy you say? Out of the way, I'll put your lump of wood back up. - Don't be stupid. - What do you mean? Put it on my back, and you hold onto it. If anything happens to you... I used to walk around town with 100 kilos on my back! In 1924, I saw him lift a cast-iron stove. So did I. I didn't, but I swear I did! Just put it on my back and have done with it. Get on that side. - You'll see. - They don't make men like that any more. Come on. He's dead! Old son! I'll lift that end. Come on. Move the bench. That's one less. He slipped. I saw him. So did I. It was done deliberately. They're all devils here! They nearly killed Péjat. The light's on. He must be in. Open up, it's us! It's us! Hey! Everyone saw you slip. They're all talking about it. You could lift 5 or 10 panels like that. Not like the cast-iron stove of 1924, that was something else. It was something else! Hey, Jean-Marie! - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Never grow old. You can steal and pillage, but never grow old. What are you on about? Old men know how to lie down, but not how to get up. They should go where they belong. That's what I've always said. Then we agree. I'll end my days with central heating and running water. Baptiste, write to your friend. I'm coming with you. Look out nuns, here we come! We'll spend our days lying on the grass. We'll take it easy, get as drunk as lords and laugh till we burst. Here's to the good life! Well? Oh... 33 are ready for slaughter. 33... That's funny. There are 33 guests at Mariette's wedding. Including Jojo's family, that makes 33. There'll be 35, not 33. - Including who? - My friends. - What? - You heard. They want to be there before they leave. You have the nerve to mention your cronies after last night? If I was a dictator, I'd run them out of town! Dictator indeed! And I'd wall them up alive. You bet I would. - That hurts! - You have to suffer to be beautiful. It'll never be ready for Saturday. - Louise can help you with the veil. - Right. You may well be spending the wedding in bed. In that case, you can take communion without me. With pleasure. You'd only upset the Good Lord. - Then take your Good Lord and... - Get lost! When you're lumbered with a drunk, the family don't need to see him. Apart from my granddaughter, it'll be the ugliest wedding ever! So, old timers, you're leaving us. We'll miss you. You mean you'll have to get your bikes repaired elsewhere. Won't you get bored there at Gouyette? That's not what my friend Malvoisin says. He's an expert at having fun. Drop it, Baptiste. It's too late to change our minds. Yesterday I'd have accepted an apology, but now... Aren't you overdoing it, Péjat? See what I mean? Here you are. - Here. - So that's it, then? You're both going? Not both, all three of us. - You're leaving your pigs? - You're coming to Gouyette? Wherever, I'm coming with you. Give me a form. If you don't leave your family while you're still healthy, they'll keep you there. When I told them I'd miss the wedding, they begged me on their knees. When are you leaving? In the morning. Don't forget the football pitch. Are they sending a van for you? What for? We're going on foot. There's only one I in Poulossière. - There is? - But there are two S's. I've put both of them. - Where? - There. Here. My eyes are fine, it's my arms that are too short. Date of birth... Old son, we're leaving right on time. Precisely. Louise, here they are. We'll be just like kids at Gouyette. Roadhog! Isn't life wonderful? Yes. We're just like kings. Not quite, but we're on the way. - Time to take over, Blaise. - Not till I get rid of these. What did you bring flowers for? We're passing the cemetery. I want to say goodbye to Marie. We were supposed to have a laugh, now he's off to the cemetery. You should've brought her water lilies. It would've brought back memories. What did you say? - You lousy cuckold! - What did you call me? The only thing Adèle's not been under is the train. Take that back or I'll bury you as well! How Marie died is a matter for Blaise and the devil. What? But that doesn't stop us taking her some flowers. We can say goodbye to our mates. Our youth is buried here. Come on. You see, Marie, I'm going to Gouyette. If you were here, I wouldn't go, but as you're not, I am. I brought you some mimosas. You didn't like them, but it's all I could find. I could hardly bring you a cauliflower! He's laughing in front of her! Bloody heathen! Hey! Whose grave are you spitting on? It's that bastard Léonard Cachou. I worked on his farm, he gave us weak cider to drink. I've told Marie I'm going to Gouyette. Where's Emile's grave? I don't know. Baptiste spat on Léonard's. Good. Serves him right for his cider. - You see? - OK, OK. - Where's Emile? - Must be that way. Yes, it is. Over there. Emile Gâton, there was a man. He was in my class. Crazy kid. He had old mother Gobilleau in a wheelbarrow. - A wheelbarrow? - Yes, old son. The wheel broke and it flipped over. Boys will be boys! Here he is. You know what, lads? I'm thinking it would please Emile if we drank to his health... I mean, to his memory. Nicely put. I'm sure he'd be delighted if we drank to him. Of course! It's not just Gâton. There's Lapoelle and Courtine too. We mustn't make them jealous. Emile first. Come on. They only wanted me to bring their luggage, and then only "to please me"! I'll pick them up on the way. They'll be glad of the lift. They'd have to be desperate. I know those three of old. Sister, take my grandfather with you. He has rheumatism. Of course, my child. Hey, you can't sit on a dead man! Then what are you doing? That's different. It's not just any dead man. Thomas Lapoelle sat next to me at school. - He used to copy from me. - Hence the squint! Now he can't hear us, he was no oil painting. That's true. He was so ugly, he was declared unfit for service! If we're going to make it to Trézelles, we'd better go and see Courtine. He's near the war memorial, by the northeast wall. He'll catch all the rain there. Not in the northeast he won't. That's true. There are colder places. Where's Courtine's grave? Over there. Ah! - What's wrong? - One of them's awake! - Where? - There. There. There! Are you quite finished, you bunch of vandals? This isn't a bar! You've been yelling for over an hour. Don't upset him. That's Jérôme Hardouin. A man in your profession shouldn't talk so loud. Anyone who buried Courtine and Gâton must be a bastard. What? Didn't you put them where they are now? Get down among the worms where you belong! - Take that! - That's for Gâton! Get out before I whack you with my shovel! Wait for me! Bloody hell! The basket! Hang on a minute. I'll cool you lot down, and your wine, too! - Grab hold, Baptiste. - Wait for me, lads. You too, Blaise. Come on! Bastards! GC 27. National 183. We're there. Yes, we are. All these places look the same to me. - I'm completely lost. - Let's ask them. Excuse me, guys. Are you local? What's it to him? They're tourists. They should take the train. That way you don't bother anyone. We want to take a look around Tioune. Nothing worth seeing there. - Which way is the chateau? - It's straight ahead. No, straight ahead's too steep. Better to go that way. He's right, then you'll see the scene of the crime. Watch what you're saying! The pond where Poulossière drowned his wife one dark night. You liars! It happened last June. If it's crime you want, I'll give them one. Their journey from Paris won't be wasted. I'll put you in the salting tub! I'll make sausages out of you! - I'll put you in a pâté! - Let's go, they're drunk. You're right. Go on, run away! He doesn't only drown women, he rapes them! Enough! I won't attack you from behind! Turn to face me! Come on! Where is it? - What? - The wine. Well, it's... I put it down on the car. - You did what? - It's no big deal. 4 litres of wine and he says it's no big deal! And to think we brought him along! Come on, Baptiste. Don't leave me here on my own! Gouyette's a rest home, not a mental asylum. Wait for me, lads! We can't leave the idiot too far behind. - Let's wait for him here. - You're right. He might get lost or run over. - Are you thirsty? - You bet I am. Shame we don't have anything. Hey, grandpa, want a lift? I'm going to Trézelles and I'm thirsty. - Get in the back. - Don't mind if I do. All right? Hold on. OK. Hey! Let's stop that lorry. He can't be far away. He doesn't deserve it. Hey! Can you give me a lift? I'm going to help an old man in distress. What the...? Get out, Baptiste's gone to look for you! Hey, Baptiste! Shit! - Hey! - Hey, Jean-Marie! Keep walking! Thanks. Old son! Old son! - Oh, it's you. - Who asked you to stop? Are you stalking pedestrians now? Touting for business? You waved at me! Me? I'd rather walk to Tibet than ask for a lift in your old crate! If I see you again, I'll run you over. I'm due in Aizenay. Go to hell instead! At least you'll be on time for once! Trézelles is that way. - Over there? - Yes. Thanks... Hey! - What? - Want a drink? No time. Out you go! You've had enough to drink. Come on. Out! Just a small one... There you are, you old soak! Drunk again, I see. They won't serve me in there. We'll see about that. You have to serve us. I've been walking for hours! It's a humanitarian matter. Get lost! I'll complain to the Red Cross! So long, lads, and thanks for the ride. So you're getting lifts too? I'm the only one still walking. Oh! How did you find him? They threw him out. Look at the state of him! He's totally legless. - Let him sleep it off. - We can't leave him here. Will you take his head? It's bound to be lighter than the rest. What a pathetic sight, at his age... - Hold him tight, Baptiste. - I am. - All the wine adds to the weight. - This way. Oh, my God... Come on. - Do you know this place? - No. It's Toto Lavigne's farm. He'll be pleased to see me. He'll no doubt be flattered. Hey, lads! - He's biting me! - Leave! Who are you? - I'm Blaise Poulossière. - I don't know any Blaise. I'm Anselme Poulossière's father, from Tioune. The Poulossières, pig farmers. You should've said so. What are you doing here? I was going to Gouyette when 2 villains robbed me. Let me help you. If you're hurt, I'll call a doctor. Otherwise you can eat with us. Don't mind if I do. I'm quite thirsty, actually. Come and have a drink, then. The dog... Down! Off you go. - Oh, that dog... - Come on. The barking's stopped. What's going on? Should we investigate? Maybe. But... where's he gone? Oh... Look at that! There's only his canteen. He can't have disappeared. The dog was here, too. - He must've eaten him. - Forget it, he's inedible. No, he's wandered off. Go and see. I've had enough excitement. I'm going for a sleep. He's not barking as loud now. Maybe he's digesting his dinner. I slept like a baby. This is a great place. - I could do with a coffee. - Coffee? Yes. It's too early for white wine and sausages. Let's see if there's a cafe open in Trézelles. Jean-Marie! Are my eyes deceiving me? Is that who I think it is? You old soak! We worried about you all night! Come down from there! What are you doing? Waiting for your tenant. - We have business. - Do you know those men? It's the two jailbirds who left me in the muck! - The bastards. - What? Jérôme! Pascal! Get your pitchforks! We have intruders. He doesn't know what he's saying. No change there. You old soak! You pig seller! You rotten dwarf! - What's up? - Chain's broken. I'm not surprised, it's a Zodiac. - That's not a good make? - It's rubbish. Hirondelle's the only good one. The rest are crap. And you're bike's mass produced in Poland. The Swiss and Italians are no good in a war, but they make good bikes. The Poles are good soldiers, but... Thanks for the geography lesson, but what about my bike? I'll fix it for you. Fetch me a stone. What you did shows the measure of you. You're only just above a jackal. And a jellyfish. - A jellyfish? - Yes. Know what I'd put last in the pecking order? Péjat. Look! Hold this, I can't see a thing. You know what you're doing. To find a specialist like me in the Vendée, you have to go to Les Deux-Sèvres or Charente. Seems there are traitors everywhere. Who are you talking to? Not you. If I was, I'd have said: "Down with the cops." What did you say? He insulted you, so shoot him! You'd be doing us a favour. A real war veteran would know how to get rid of him. This man is a cyclist. Whether a gendarme or a priest, he's still a man on a bike. A civil servant and a pig farmer wouldn't understand. You'll be fine now. - Thanks. - There you go. I'd have been done for without you. Shit! I've got a flat Tyre. Oh! Whoever punctured his Tyre had better say his prayers! You saved our honour, old son! You again! Here, have a drink. - What's this? - Hooch. - Well? - It's good. What about my Tyre? Use it as a spare belt. You're getting on my nerves. That's my Jean-Marie! We shouldn't have let him go. I've wanted to beat up a gendarme since I was a kid. Now we've missed our chance. I'm glad we settled our differences thanks to that clown. I feel re-invigorated. We still have to make it to Gouyette. I'll lead you there. Let's go, lads. Are you sure this is the way? It's a short cut. It's called the commando crawl. So much for your short cut. You should write it down. What kind of place is this? What? I can't hear myself think! It's that way. Stop rubbing! - What does it say? - "No fishing". Then I was right. There used to be a river here. Then where is it? Where's the bridge? Some guide you are. They must've blown it up in 1940. It will have diverted the river. How can I find my way in a war-torn landscape? In other words, we're lost. No, we just wandered off the path. - If only it was dark... - That'd be perfect! I'd navigate by the Pole Star. Baptiste, kick him! I haven't the strength. Plus, the moss on the trees grows on the north side. But Gouyette's west of here. To think I left my dear family to follow this ass! An artillery man never complains. May as well just lie down here and wait for death to come. - You're sleeping there? - Looks that way. What are you doing? He's singing because he's scared. As kids when we came home through the woods, he always sang. He thought there were wolves. You're a liar! And you're a coward. A coward who was in the 42nd Regiment! Yes, and the Prussians beat you. - Go to hell. - Why, you... Shut up, both of you! I'm trying to sleep. What train is that? It's the 10.12, lads! The lost traveller has two friends: Saint Christopher and the railway. Where the train goes, there go we. Just follow the tracks. I told you we weren't lost. It's hard to walk on this ballast. That's not what it's made for. Then it should be. The civil servants don't care about pedestrians. If you don't like progress, go back to your scrub. Try walking then. The wolves would've eaten us. We pay our taxes but can't say anything. It's like in Turkey under Abdulhamid, only now it's Baptiste Talon I want to put a firework under. Long live 1789! Normally he only mentions the Great War. - He's not even drunk. - Maybe he's hungry. - Want a biscuit? - Stick it in your toaster. Hey, I've found my pipe! Blaise, pinch me. See that tower? - Where? - There, straight ahead. It's Les Echauguettes! - Borgelle's father's farm. - I worked there in 1920. And I the year after. I lost my watch there. Green enamel with Roman numerals. - Remember the Cateau girl? - Catherine? You bet I do! As I recall, she made paper sweets every Saturday. Yes, she cut them out of the newspaper. I remember it well, old son. - What if we meet Borgelle? - He'll be dead by now. Madame Catherine, telephone. Telephone. Mademoiselle. Was that Catherine Cateau? No, it's Catherine de Borgelle, the boss. She married Borgelle's father, who died 2 years ago. What do you want? We're friends of your boss. I'm off. I've had enough of your shenanigans. What are you three doing here? What do you want? Don't you recognise me, Cathy? Why, do I know you? Blaise. Blaise Poulossière. Blaise! A little blond kid with a mustache and a centre parting. I had a centre parting in 1920! - 1920... - I came for the harvest. 1920's a long time ago. But it's possible. I'm Baptiste Talon. 1921. Baptiste... That rings a bell. Hold on. - Curly brown hair! - Exactly. Now let me guess. You don't know him. We're taking him to Gouyette. Oh... - So, you're not dead, then? - Apparently not. Nice of you to stop by. Let's have a glass of wine. There's chicken for lunch. - Don't mind if I do. - Come on. We can't. - We'll be late. - What's he on about? In a hurry to die at Gouyette? You've got a nerve! OK, let's eat. - We've got TV in our cafe, too. - You have to move with the times. All right, lads? Never better. Hey, Jean-Marie? Catherine's looking well. And why would that be? What do you mean? Oh, nothing. What do you think of this? And 1921, what does that mean? You're talking like a priest. Get to the point. You've been made welcome here thanks to me. During the harvest of '21, I had my way with Catherine. What are you saying? I had her in 1920! And my wife didn't go off with a station master! What are you two boasting about? Catherine and I celebrated her 20th birthday in 1919. I was the last, but I'm the most memorable. Right! How dare you! Take that! Still angry, are we? Where the hell are they? Surely they haven't absconded. What if they were run over? The whole town's worried. Some of them blame us for letting them go. So what are we going to do? I don't want to call the gendarmes. I suggest a search party. They're a pain even when they're not here. Don't say that. They may be dead. Lesage, phone Gouyette again. Is that it? Is that Gouyette? You can't be shut away in there, old son. - Jean-Marie! - What? Come here. Look at the place! You're going in? Baptiste, don't go in! Don't be a fool! Look. Baptiste, don't go in there. It's a jail for old people! Gentlemen. Hello. We've been looking for you for two days. We got lost in the woods. It happens. - Lost? - Yes. In the local cafes, you mean. We know all about it. What's that? A souvenir of the Great War. - Is that alcohol? - Yes. - Not here. - It's 15-year-old hooch! - Mademoiselle... - Mother, if you please. Mother. Mother, we're here by recommendation. I'm a personal friend of Gaspard Malvoisin. Poor Mr Malvoisin is dead. No! Three months ago. Malvoisin's dead? That's all we needed. Are they locking you up, you old reprobates? - You can... - Sister Jeanne. Take them away. De-lousing, disinfection, shower. Off you go. Looks like we're stuck here, lads. - Why are you trembling? - Because I'm scared. Then sing! Look out... Make sure you scrub. It's boiling hot! Oh, my feet.. I was exaggerating about Catherine. I only kissed her a little on the quiet. I made more of it than I should. Catherine and I went for walks in the country and we held hands. - Got anything to say? - About what? We're a bunch of liars, that's all! You guys! This isn't soup, it's water! We still have our own teeth, you know. Malvoisin said we'd get wine. A litre par week. And to think I trusted him. Long live secularism! We know what Malvoisin died of. Hunger and thirst. Not to mention all the lies he told me! My fellow citizens, dear friends, gentlemen, I have great news: the old timers are at Gouyette. Not only that, but they're asleep in bed. Let's sneak out, lads, like at Verdun. Dead end. Hey! We're won't be leaving empty-handed. Wine! I can't get to it. Take the top one. Come on, you're the lightest. - I'm the lightest? - Yes. You think? It'll fall down! Hold me tight, lads. - Here. - You've got it. Any more? Goddammit! Stop ringing that bell! Lads! Fire! Fire! Goddammit! Fire! - Get the table, boys. - What? - What table? - Come on. Don't start that again. You'll be flattened. Don't give up. Get up on there. Come out of there! I slipped the other day. Hurry up! Help me up. Push my behind, lads. It wasn't like this 40 years ago. Hold tight, old son. Gunners, mount your horses! Here we go! Take this bottle. Here's to freedom! I know you're both sulking, but I don't understand why. You have no shame. He's asking for a good hiding. Look, Baptiste, we had it easy back home. You've made us into a pair of vagabonds. I didn't ask you to come with me. The cheek! You think we wanted to go? My brothers, I was deceived, taken advantage of. - Malvoisin's to blame. - Don't accuse the dead. The devil was right to take him. May he roast like a sausage. That'll teach him to make fun of me... Of us. You railwaymen sure bear grudges. Meanwhile we're doing the walk of shame. If you pay for our bus tickets, maybe we'll forgive you. You're taking advantage of the situation. So much for Tibet. Tioune by bus, is it? What are you waiting for? It's my cross and I have to bear it. - Three? - Yes. - 3 francs. - Each? No, in total. So, did they kick you out, then? I'd rather leave the country than go back to the village. Whatever you say. Bus drivers have some pride. We were asked to go back. By whom? Duty. What did you say? That we're going home to take matters in hand. We've let things slide for too long. Some people have got above themselves. - What? - What do you mean by that? We'll silence the complainers. I'm standing for election. Bravo! We'll campaign for you. And the youngsters can play football at Gouyette. Tioune needs taking in hand. With Baptiste, it's his way or the highway. You can't tell us what to do in our own town! What are you on about? Watch what you're doing with your chicken crates! Calm down. Bus drivers think they're above the law. Poultry and passengers together! We'll soon change that. - That's why we came back. - Not so fast. Hooray! Here you are, kids! Oh, Grandad! My granddaughter! They're back. Stay here, Marie. I'll be right back. Go home, kids. Go on. Get out of it! What's happened now? Did you hear what I said? Until now, you've been unbearable within the town. But recently, your exploits have gone beyond our borders. Broken bottles, riotous behaviour, nighttime incursions. Several in Gouyette have been confined to bed due to the shock. You can stay here on one condition: stop acting like children. You're old enough to behave like adults. Why don't you send us back to school? And on Saturday we'll be graded. Quiet! I don't know whether to take you to the wedding or the courthouse. We can tell the judge about my field. - Let him talk, Baptiste. - I'm resisting oppression. Keep your mouth shut. Suppose we want to comply, what do we have to do? Be good! - Hip, hip... - Hooray! Nice to see the youngsters having fun. Such good kids. Sport is healthy. Long live the youth. They're France's future. Our country depends on them. - It's landed in Péjat's place. - Don't worry about it. It's in the old timer's place. Sorry, but the ball's in your place. No, it's not. We saw it land in old Gobineau's place. - But we'll help you find it. - Naturally. Don't trouble yourselves. Helping people is all we have to do. Helping people is the role of the old. - Come on, Blaise. - There you go. Subtitles: ECLAIR
