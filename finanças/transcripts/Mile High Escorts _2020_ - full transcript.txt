Well, Ashley and I were wondering how someone gets into your type of work. Hmm. This was my father's retirement gift. He was an aeronautical engineer. Flying has always been in my family's blood.

So... I saved enough to found my own private airline, and soon I recognized that the wealthy men I was flying all around the world needed more than just transportation. They needed companionship. And while society may perhaps deem what we do a crime, it is a victimless one. I personally make sure of that.

Well, there's been a development that you should be aware of. Our girl Lauren would like to take a step back. Lauren? What? No. She's one of our biggest earners. Figure out a way to make it work. Well, I don't think it's possible. She's fallen in love and does not want to see the rest of her clients. Does it look like I care about love? Entice her, scare her, I don't care. Whatever you have to do, okay? No. No? Mm-mm. What do you mean, no? Lauren is not a slave. She's her own person. She wants out, she wants out. I'm not gonna let you bully her into doing something she doesn't want to do. You won't let me? Wow. Okay. Let me make something abundantly clear to you. I am in charge. These girls, they're not your friends or your sad surrogate daughters. They are assets. Tools. Valuable tools with one purpose: to make me money. My father may have treated them like princesses, but they aren't. They are property, and they c... - Oh, I wouldn't go there. - Ah, ah! I am not finished. You, too, are a valuable tool. I didn't keep you around for your shining personality. I expect you to manage these girls, or I will kick you to the curb like the trash that you are. - Listen, you son of a bitch... - No! You listen to me! You have your orders. Carry them out. Otherwise, Lauren may no longer be valuable to me, and she may have an unfortunate accident, just like Jenny. - Jenny. - Mm-hmm. - You're evil. - No, I know she was keeping the company's cut for weeks, saving up, trying to get ahead before she could quit, and I know you were covering for her. Now, the only reason I didn't rat you out to my father before is 'cause I know he would never have taken my word over yours. Since Jenny wanted out and Jenny was stealing from us and Jenny would have sold us out to the Feds or worse when she ran out of money, Jenny was dealt with! Now go handle Lauren or she will be dealt with too. No. I cannot let you continue to abuse these girls. What are you going to do about it? You were so worried about Jenny going to the police. I could bury you. Be very careful, Hannah. There are some lines you cannot uncross. No, you be very careful, Eric.

Hannah said she'd talk to Eric, but that was a couple days ago, and I still haven't heard back. Hmm. Oh, maybe that's her. Uh, it's Eric. That's weird. Well, are you gonna answer it? I... I guess I should. Hi, Eric. What's up? Lauren, I hate to do this to you, but I need you and Ashley in Paris ASAP. Oh, um, has Hannah talked to you recently, by chance? Yeah, she said you wanted to take a step back. Yes, um, would that be okay? Listen, we're in a real sling over here, and it would be a huge help if you could just take a few extra flights while we figure it out, okay? Oh, okay. Um... That seems fair. Great. Bye. I guess we're going to Paris. Isn't it weird that Boss Man's calling us about that? I mean, isn't that Hannah's job? Hmm. Hi. I just got to my hotel. I'm so excited to see you. Yeah, I'm excited to see you too. I miss you. Uh, so when should I expect you? Um, I'm just gonna do a few more flights because Hannah's been so good to me, and I don't wanna leave anyone here in a bind, but I'm only working tonight, so maybe I can come over tomorrow? Yeah, okay. Uh, yeah, well, I... I sense some wine and chocolate in your future. Sounds perfect. Okay, um, I gotta go. I love you. I love you too. Be safe. Bye. Hi, Lauren. If you're watching this, then there are some things you need to hear because if this has been delivered to you, then I'm probably dead. I have been growing more and more worried about Eric. He is a time bomb waiting to blow. He's begun hurting girls and I think even worse. Another girl named Jenny, just like you, wanted to get out, and she's disappeared. He may have killed her, so if I'm gone, you are not safe. You need to do whatever Eric says. Just pretend however you can, and collect as much information about him as you can get and take it to the cops and put him away. It's the only way that you and your family will be safe. I'm really sorry that this is all landing on you, but I believe in you. You're really like the daughter that I never had, or maybe even like the daughter I could have had if I'd made some different choices. Be strong, be careful, and know that I'm thinking about you.

He isn't answering his phone. Besides, our dates for tonight are already set. We can't bail or we'll look suspicious. We just need Harold or Jonas to spill some dirt on Eric. - Well, like what? - Maybe ask about other dates. Uh, that girl Jenny that disappeared? Maybe they know something, anything you can use as evidence. And then we'll go to the cops, he'll go to jail, and we'll never have to worry about him again, okay? Okay. My dear, you're too kind.

Don't you enjoy getting to know each other better? I'm curious about how a man of your stature operates. Well, in that case, I'm actually an old friend of Eric's. Met him in boarding school when we were just kids. He is doing a great job of taking over for poor Franklin. He does seem kind of mysterious though, don't you think? Eric, mysterious? I... I don't know. Oh. Not even a little bit? I do love a good mystery. Well, I have heard things. What sorts of things? Uh, let's just say I wouldn't be surprised if he's gotten his hands dirty.
