I am happy. Madly happy. You can do anything to me. If you said "Anne, we're going to the top of the Eiffel Tower - - and you're going to jump off" I would do so. Any time. I dare tell you this because you know what I mean. You understand that you may do anything to me. And I want you to. Message - Response It's me. You've probably left. I'm in no mood for a hen night. I don't know... I feel like the little pink bunny - - in the battery commercial, banging away at its drum, - - all alone. But I'm glad you're coming. See you soon. Why aren't you dressed up? Time to kiss the mermaid. Cheers! One girl alone with so many guys? I don't dare. Normally nothing's kinky enough for you. Into your limo, Bolette. ... We're out of here. I've got to go. I know it's mean of me. No, we'll go together. Shut up! You're going to leave me here? - I've no choice. All you're going to do is hump with your gut doctor. Mona... CREDO we will turn you into the complete human being Hey, that's Martin. And that's me. Wow! Sorry, sorry... You Mono? Mona? - Mona, yes. She's good. A house in a town. You spelt it for her, Bolette! Stop it! I didn't even know that. - Did you hear that? Strong now! Shut up! It's your hen night. - Only two weeks to go. Can we stop? I'm going to get Anne. Mona, we'll come with you. So many people can't play doctors and nurses. See you later. Dr. B. Lack consultant psychiatrist Hallo? - Dr. Lack? Ja? My name's Mona W?lin. Is that Dr. Lack? I am Anne's girlfriend. Hello? Dr. Lack? Dr. Lack would like to talk to you. Aren't I lucky? Sorry to intrude... - Thank you, Svane. Bloody hell! I saw your light and I thought... What the hell did I think? ... I bet you think it's peculiar, - - me bursting in like this. Listen... Are you... Should I say Doctor? Or should I say Sir? Or Sire? Is she still here? I can't talk... about my patients. Come off it! Anne isn't a patient. You won't admit you're going with her? Don't you like young flesh? It's bloody hot in here. The one thing... that may be not... ... quite healthy about Anne is that she's a bit wild. But I expect Dr. B. Lack likes that, right? What does the B stand for? Brian? B?rge? Dr. B?rge Lack. Hey, I've a right to know the first name of my girlfriend's secret lover. Birger! "Senior consultant Dr. B. Lack." "Department of Psychiatry F5, Bispebjerg Hospital". "Dear..." "... Bernhard Lack". What is it about you and young girls? Now I think you should go home. Maybe you're gay? No, I'm sorry. Doesn't it get to you? The heat? What are you afraid of? Afraid? I'm not afraid. What should I be afraid of? You? Or the hand kisser? What is passion? What is passion? Passion is the instant when you are honest to yourself. Do you know yourself? Do you know... ... your own passion? If you do not know your own passion - - you have never met yourself. How does one meet passion? By being honest. I don't know you, but... Haven't you ever felt... Mona, you're name is Mona, isn't it? Mona, Mona, haven't you ever felt that everything is grey - - and that life is floating by as you watch? Seize it, Mona. Seize it before it is too late. My name is Karen and I work with my husband. You must realise that you have a major task ahead of you. Are you lost? Do you know the way out? we are not afraid Hi, Anne speaking. Sorry about yesterday - - but that's life, and I've nearly finished the dress. Martin, why the hell don't you ever call me? Is that the bride? Hi! - Close your eyes, no peeping! Not done your face yet? - Get your dress off, sister. I'll punch you if you peep. Then I won't. - I wouldn't. Shall I put my foot down? - Yes, carefully. There. Sorry about yesterday, but your dress was far from done - - and I'd had it with Bolette. Got a cold drink? - Let me find the other end... All right! You're sweating like a docker. I hope you don't sweat in church... Lovely. OK, OK. You can look. OK. - Yes. There'll be more layers, right? - No, no. No... Anne, people will see everything. You've got the knockers for it. - Honestly! Isn't it gorgeous? - Yes, it's bloody gorgeous. But it won't do for a wedding. Martin would flip his lid. His mother also has a dress to show me. Hey, I've better things to do. Like finding someone you haven't bonked yet. Sorry, sorry... I'd far rather wear this. It's bloody gorgeous. I don't know if I dare. - No panties, either. No, Anne, stop it! See, that's forty times nicer. And more innocent. No need to hide from your groom. I'm not doing it. Sorry. I'm not. I think you should take mum-in-law's shop model. It'll cover your beaver, too. I'm fucking sick of you. I went to fetch you yesterday. Where from? - You think I'm a complete idiot? From Lack's. From Dr. Bernhard Lack's. What were you doing there? Actually it turns out that he is a consultant psychiatrist. So I'm sorry I called him a gut doctor. What the hell did you go there for? - I wanted you, not the girl guides. Did he say anything about me? No. - Are you sure? He calls you his patient. That's freaky. Why the hell won't you let me have anything to myself? You're always on my tail. Stay away. Maybe you need treatment. - Just stay away. we worship passion Who decides when we end and when we begin? You do. - Why? Because... ... otherwise I don't dare. Dare? Dare what? To live. Live? How dare you even say that word? I'm sorry. Oh? Now you want to say sorry? Elizabeth wants to apologise - - to you all. Sorry. Sorry... That will do. Thank you, that will do. You want to live? If you want to live you must learn to abandon yourself unconditionally - - to other people. My little girl... Come, come. Don't be frightened. Mona has come. We know she has. Excuse me, I just wanted to talk to Dr. Lack. She's decided to become a complete human being... I think we should show Mona that she is always welcome here. Sorry... sorry... Say what you like... - I don't want to see you again. Bolette, what are you doing here? Rescuing my kid brother's beloved bonsai trees. I have been watering them. What a fright you gave me! I think his elm has already died. Wrap them in damp tea towels, like I do. You might have phoned first. Don't forget. Thanks for the other night. - You just disappeared. Want a drink? - No, thanks. Have you talked to Martin? - What do you mean? I talk to him every day. - I can never get hold of him. They're seven hours ahead. I phone at night. Where is Anne going to sit? Anne? If she turns up at all. - Of course she'll come. What time do you phone him? I just did... he wondered why you weren't at home. Though mum refuses to accept that she is ill, - - taking on all this is not good for her. Is it? Cheerio. Hello? Hello? Martin, is that you? What do you think, Mona? - What do I think? It's fantastic. I didn't know you were planning to move. Us? But it's for Martin and you. ... Didn't you realise? No, I did not! It's really kind of you both. But we can't accept. - Accept? We're just happy we are able to help you. Neither Martin nor I had imagined living in a house. We want to travel. - Haven't you talked to Martin? About what? - He gave me precise instructions. Size, location... I was so pleased when we found this house. We've got our money's worth, you must admit, Mona. It's awfully nice of you, but actually... ... Martin and I were going to... ... travel. Martin wanted it to be a surprise. God, I am stupid. Sometimes I am so impulsive ... almost spontaneous. Mona, promise me one thing. Never tell Martin that I showed you the house. There is nothing worse than spoiling someone's surprise. I hardly ever talk to him. Try phoning at night. Look around! It'll make your life complete. we are honest When I really let go... ... I always have to lie to myself. I know it's shit... Sorry, it's... ... It's bad for me in the long run. That's what I feel. No, Mona, you're not that lukewarm. Lukewarm? I've created a little association game. Do you feel like trying it? - What's the idea? Yes, what is the idea? To find out how lukewarm you are. - I'm really passionate. I know thy works. Thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. But thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, - - so I will spue thee out of my mouth. Missy knows her scriptures! I'll be back forthwith. How good to see you, Mona! I'm so happy you want to try... - Isn't Lack... Lack never does this kind of thing himself. As I told you, it's a protracted process. But you've taken the first step - - towards a life in greater harmony with yourself. Take off your shoes; I'll massage your body and feet. The body reveals its weak points. What's the idea of all this? You must relax, or it won't work. There... Please take your top off and lie on your tummy. Now you'll hear some sounds. We're interested in your thoughts as you perceive the sounds. There are no right or wrong answers. But you must answer spontaneously. Coolness. Um... dullness. You must answer spontaneously. - Sorry. Person. Cat. Childhood. Kiss. Discomfort. Loneliness. I'm sorry, Mona, but our little test did not go well. We were most surprised. We were so sure of you. But the test showed you were not honest enough. I'm sorry, Mona. - I didn't know it was a test. Wasn't it just for fun? Or I'd have stayed awake. I must ask you to leave. I just relaxed. - You are not qualified. Qualified for what? - To be a complete human being. I want to talk to Dr. Lack. - He will listen to the test. Bloody hell! Is it because I fell asleep? I am sorry. - I must ask you to leave. You didn't say a word about... we are waiting for you You wanted to see Dr. Lack? - Yes. Follow me... - Thanks. Mona W?lin? - Yes. What is your association with Dr. Lack? Are you a patient? No, no, I just want to talk to him. Talk to him? - Yes, talk to him. Who gave you the impression that he worked here? I just know he does. Dr. Lack left this hospital nearly two years ago. His methods... his aim is to totally dissolve his patients' personalities. But... ... he's surely one of the greatest men in his field, - - here and abroad. But his methods were incompatible with hospital practice. I don't get you. There are limits as to what I can say. He's still a member of the Danish Medical Association. And I'm not entirely objective. But you may give him my regards - - and tell him that I am following his case very closely, - - and that I am far from the only one. The police may become involved. I'd be unwise - - to say any more. But don't say I didn't warn you. Take my advice. Stay well away from Lack. Anne? Where are you? I have listened to your test, Mona. What the devil are you doing here? - I disagree with Karen. I think you are open and honest. - Sod you. Isn't Anne here? A senior consultant, Frederiksen, told me about you... Frederiksen? So they've made him a senior consultant? His contribution to psychiatry - - is the over-use of pills. I feel our responsibility extends further than that, - - as does his son, whom you met here. Svane. Svane is Frederiksen's son? - Yes. He is so obsessed with "rescuing" his son from my "sect" - - that he has lost his powers of judgement. And the police are involved. I had to ask for a restraining order. He was harassing us. Actually, I'm sorry for him. But we were meant to talk about your test. When you heard the door banging in the wind, - - you responded "loneliness". Nothing unusual about that. But what I noticed - - was the way you said it. Loneliness... It wasn't just a word. Mona, are you very lonely? Why did they fire you? When I met Karen, my life changed completely. Everything else paled into insignificance. Love, Mona... It fills you. Love. What is your fianc? called? - Martin. Why don't you feel it for him? - He is in Hong Kong, it's tough. Are you and I to be honest with one another? I don't doubt that you have loved Martin, but... Isn't there a yearning inside you? That you would like to have quenched? Why do you think you came to see me? I don't know. We can't do it in one day, - - but maybe there is a seed in you - - that will one day find succour, - - germinate and bear fruit. Mona, I want to see you again, I want to see you. I want to see you. Didn't I tell you to stay away from him? Cool it, Anne. I hate you. Anne, cool it, will you? Anne... - It has to be this way. His task is to see how far we can go. It's insane. You've got to try to stay away from him. You think I don't want to? - Just stay away from him. God, you are so naive. - They can't hurt you for leaving. I can't live without him. I can't get by on my own. I am far stronger when I am with them. I know it's really bad. But that's how it is. You know I'm here for you. - You don't know what it means. To abandon oneself, to belong... He can turn me into a better person. By beating you up? - I asked for it. It feels so right. I can't live without them. That's just something they make you believe. I dare not. I'll help you out of it. You've so much to see to. - Never mind that. What the hell can you do? Take that wet dress off. we know everything When was the last time we did this? It was on Cristal. Where I met my love. What a jerk! Let's go away again. You've got a honeymoon first. - Fuck the wedding. Fuck Martin. Fuck Lack and all that shit. You want to go to Martinique. - No, Mustique. Forget it, it'd cost a fortune. I mean it. - Sweet dreams... In ten days you'll be going up the aisle. In ten days we'll be on the other side of the world. We'll take the first plane tomorrow. ... I mean it! What will you tell Martin? - Martin? He's never there. But his mum's cool. - What's wrong with her? Sclerosis. Shit! - Sometimes you have me on. - Are you on?... Are you? Yes. Down the hatch! Just let it ring. We leave tomorrow no matter fucking what. OK? A deal? Isn't it a bit... a bit vulgar? Vulgar? No, you are right, it won't do. No, you haven't the bosom. - It was very pretty, though. We could do this another day. We haven't much time, if they have to alter it. This is also a very pretty model. Two layers of silk, woven in different directions. It might sound dramatic, but you need to see it on. Would you lend me a hand? I'm stuck. It was crooked. There. It's a very pretty shade of ivory. Isn't it the same as I tried before? Too much? - I think so. Shall we look for something simpler? - Yes. We have this very pretty, simple model, very girlish. That suits you. Are you pregnant, Mona? - No. No, I'm not. Too much wine last night. Do you like the dress? - Mmm... it's really pretty. Martin is an unusual boy. He needs a lot of love. Do you follow me? Yes, yes, of course. - I don't think you do. Two seconds... It's me. "How goes?"' - I've felt better. I'm nearly ready. What did she say? I haven't told her yet. I'll tell her now. You've changed your mind. That's OK. Oh, stop it! I'll come for you in a taxi. Then we'll pick up my stuff. - OK. How long? - 15 minutes from now. Hang on a mo... - No, I'm going to tell her now. There is one thing we must discuss. - Of course. The seating plan. No, it's my girlfriend. My very best friend. - Anne. She's coming, too. She's in trouble. There's this doctor. Or... it's a kind of sect. She's been beaten up by them. - Oh, poor girl! She's afraid of them. But she can't live without them ... she's been brainwashed. I know the sort of thing. - I said I'd go away with her. Borrow the cottage for a few days. It'll be for longer than that. The wedding... I thought we might postpone it. - One must help one's friends. But Anne - - can surely cope. A true friend wouldn't spoil your wedding. It won't be spoiled. Just postponed. Martin hasn't come home yet. If we... ... postpone it a bit, he and I will be able to find one another again. Before we get married. - "Find one another again?"' Let's make no hasty decisions. - It's not hasty. I do apologise, Mrs Blok. - Anne... Anne needs me. People will understand. I've been in court with a Moroccan kitchen boy - - who now wants paid holiday. Hello. Here are the suggestions we discussed on the telephone. I have to say it will be slightly dearer than we thought. Your daughter brought the seating plan in this morning. Could we put the round tables over here, and the long table here? I doubt it... Oh, just a moment ... yes, it might work. Martin's father bought ten crates of Margaux the year Martin was born. They were intended for his graduation party, - - but he went to Australia. If we paid corkage... For an event of these dimensions we won't quibble about corkage. I must run. I'll give you the key to the holiday cottage. Will you toot again? Anne? Anne, open the door! Anne, open the door! It smells of faeces in there. She is dead. Nonsense... Anne, open the door! - She's been dead for ages. Anne, open up! Can you hear me? What are you up to? That pen is poisonous. Here... Have this... Is Anne here? I mustn't say who comes here. Look what I've got, Mummy! I don't want you to say Mummy. My name is Karen. So you must call me Karen. I use your name, don't I? I don't say "Child", do I? I say Freja, for that's your name. Give Mona her things back. And wash your face. You're late. Late? I've only come to fetch Anne. I want you to do anything. Actually I don't want to do anything on my own again. Actually I only want to live... ... if I can be with you. I am happy, madly happy. What have you done to her? It has been a difficult process for Anne. I found it difficult in my time, too. Terribly, terribly difficult. - You forced her to say all that. Is Mona jealous of Anne? Because Mona feels lonely? Mona, I love you and I can help you become a complete human being. Tell me where she is! - This is not about Anne. Come to the island. Accept Svane. - Look... Thanks, Svane. - It feels pleasant. Thank you, Svane. - Mona, I love you. That will do, Svane... Help! Mona, Mona, I can tell you're listening. Mona, I'll find you. Anne! Anne! Mona! You're sure nothing is missing? Credit cards? Can you stay with your fianc?'s mother? No, that's OK. The problem is my girlfriend. I'm afraid something's... She was trying to leave the sect... - Excuse me a moment. Sergeant Holm... How are you feeling? I'll be with you in a moment. We have a very good psychologist. - I don't feel like it. It's best to talk about it... - I'm worried about Anne. I know strange things go on at Dr. Lack's. But we can't act unless an offence is committed. How long has your girlfriend been missing? Since yesterday... And I know she's at Lack's. Try phoning her. Hello, Anne speaking. - Anne? Where have you been? I heard your voice on the tape... You... can always ring me if anything happens to her. we trust nobody but each other Thank you Maria, for coming at such short notice. Thank you, Mrs Blok. Good-bye. Good-bye. - Now it looks decent again. Are you sure you don't want to stay with us? No, I'm OK. I understand why you don't want to talk about it. How can anyone be so egocentric? Taking it out on innocent people? You'd never met him before? No. Have you heard from Martin? - No... I'll try. How embarrassing! He had to see a shipper about getting his car home. He might have waited, after all you've been through. Or come home. Or phoned. So tactless, - - stupid. I'm ashamed. Does Martin keep Cognac? If you are angry, Mona, I do understand. But you must remember that you bring out other sides of him. He seemed so... ... sincere and considerate. You seemed so happy together. I've got to find out what's wrong with Anne. If you like, I'll talk to her. A girl of her talents ... the awards she won... We could ask her to sew your wedding dress. That would give her something else to occupy her... Can I take you down to your car now? I really need a lie-down. No need, I'll manage. I'll show myself out. I can find the way out ... of my son's flat. Don't hang up. If you do I'll come and get you. Anne, are you there? Where is Anne? Anne who? - Anne H?egh, who lives here. How would I know who lives here? - This is her stuff. All I do is pack it. - Where are you taking it? Who booked you to come? Mona.. you've got to help me. Where are you? - Help me! I'll be back in two seconds. Anne? Anne? What can we do for you? - Where is she? Let's talk. I haven't come to listen to you. Tell me where she is. - Anne? She's here. I'll tell her you've been. I want to see her now. - Your concern is admirable. Or the police can fetch her. - Let's talk about your life. I'll call the police. - The phone's right here. Anne... are you OK? Anne? Anne... I have a taxi downstairs. Have you got any things? If you want to go, go. - Come on. Eh?... Come on... Anne... Come along, we'll go back to my place. Anne! Someone smashed the door. My girlfriend is locked up here. - Did you smash the glass? Yes. - Your name and address. OK? What's this about your girlfriend? It's a sect. I think she's drugged. She's like a zombie. ... She's in it, too. The young lady says her friend is being detained against her will. By a sect. - I know Mona. My husband and I have a psychiatric clinic here. We don't detain people. There's nobody here. - I just saw Anne in there. You're welcome to check. Anne? Anne? Anne? Anne? Anne? - That will do. Let go, damn you! - Sorry to have troubled you. We must be prepared for anything in our profession. You must do something. They've kidnapped her. Beat it. Another policeman told me to phone if I didn't hear from her. I've got his card at home. The police won't help, Mona. What could they do, anyway? The same thing happened to my son. She wasn't there when the police arrived? I thought not. They're on their way into the definitive phase. I think he's taken her with him. Where? - To Or Island. The terminus. Lack's disciples all follow him to Or Island. To begin a new life under his direction. One doesn't need to travel across the globe to find such things. We must go there. Under no circumstances, Mona. Do not go. Hello, Mina, my name's Birthe. You wanted to talk to me. You're the police psychologist? ... I haven't time. You're no use to me, my friend's been kidnapped. You mustn't blame yourself for everything. Is Sergeant Holm there? ... Pass me that plastic bag. This one? - Yes. Tell him that I'm going to Or Island - - and I'll call when I get there. Say it's about Anne H?egh. Has the young man's suicide made you think of similar experiences... Get that, will you? Experiences like this - - sometimes release repressed feelings. If you feel pain and grief now, that's normal. In his state, You couldn't have stopped him. Would you please leave? - Yes, all right, but... Mona? Don't you think the two of us should have a quiet chat? Yes. I don't want to do the wrong thing. - I'm the psychologist. I'm so glad you've come. Mona is not well. Careful, now. I want to... Mona? All the lists are done. - We should talk about this. Together. - I hardly think so. Where are you going? - Or Island. Bolette, I have watered the bonsai trees. Hello there! Hello, I'd like a taxi to Dr. Lack's course centre. My brother's taking someone else. You can wait here. He'll be back soon. There are magazines. May I use the phone? To phone Copenhagen? - To phone the police. That'll be 7 crowns. I've no change. - That's OK. Copenhagen Police HQ... - Sergeant Holm, please. He's in a meeting. Can I take a message? Tell him that Mona W?lin phoned. I'll get him to phone back as soon as he can... Is there a number? It's Or Island. 5433 2785. I've got that. - Thanks. Good-bye. She wants a ride? - To the centre. I'm waiting for the police to call back. It'll be 45 crowns. - I just gave him 100. It's another account. Give the money to him. That's all right. - Is it far? I've already been there today. - You eating? No, thank you. Hello? - Mona W?lin? Holm has been called out on an urgent case. He'll be in touch. Please be patient. Why have we stopped? You have to wear this. Like the other one. Come on! - Stop it. Cooee! Cooee! I'm coming. Little girlie... - If that's you, I'll smash you. This is private property. You've no business here. So beat it. Understand? I want to join. What? I don't think I heard. - I want to join. You expect us to believe that? I want to join. Please... Please... we take care of you Here... There are dry clothes in there. Tuck your shirt in. Yes. We've no time to spare, the others are coming tomorrow. Wait here. Come on. You will sleep here. You'd like to stay? If you leave your bed in the night - - it will prove that you lack the will. So I must lock the door. Do you understand? I didn't hear you. Do you understand? Yes. Yes what? I understand that you must lock the door. Good. Good, Mona. Sleep tight. Mummy! Mummy... Mummy... Mummy... Mummy... Mummy? - No, it's Mona. Please be my Mummy. - Where is Anne? Please... - Where did you get her dress? I took it from the other cellar. - Where is that? Where Anne sleeps in the white room... Go that way. You'll never leave here. Never. Once you're in, you never get out. You cannot live without us. I will turn you into a complete human being. You cannot live without us. Anne... Anne, it's me. Anne? What are you doing? I have spoken to Anne. She is ready. She's on the right path. Once I was on the right path, too. You are in the midst of a process. - We are creating a new being. A complete human being. - We can do it. That's what we are doing. I have no faith in you any more. You are finished. Alone, you are but a terrified little girl. Fix the two little girls, or you're finished. Then I will decide how we live, when we live, and when we die. Mona... Wasn't it wonderful? It can get so intense in there. Mona... you still have time to become a complete human being. You can come back to life. The greatest gift is when a person finds its way back, - - for then it has found itself. Mona... Mona... Yes, yes, let it all out. Let your aggressions out! Let it all out! Let it out, let it out! No! - Mona! No! You can still become a complete human being. I want to come back in. I want you alone. Anne, don't! No, don't do it! Hi, Anne! Come along, Freja. Come on, everyone! Excuse me... I have a book which will interest you. It's about the way to a better life, and the path to happiness. You just have to be honest. To be honest... -... Let's get out of here! we love you
