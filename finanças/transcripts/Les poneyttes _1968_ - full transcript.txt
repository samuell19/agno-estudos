It's 11:15 p.m. This is Radio Happening, the most pirate of all pirate stations. Let's go! Rosko has a wonderful surprise for you! Here we go! Tonight on Radio Happening, we love you! ROSKO WALKS ON WATER President Rosko never breaks a promise. Radio Happening! The station that loves you! Tonight, it's Johnny Hallyday! We'll be there in an hour. Look out! The moment you've all been waiting for is here. Poupoune is going to take the mic. She's got something to say. My designer is rich. Listen up, Ponies. That's you. You know what girls like? We like well-dressed ponies. We like trendy ponies. So don't wait: go to Mayfair. You'll find it all there. Everything. Look out! It's that time… Johnny is here! Nice of you to come on Radio Happening. Did you get here alright? I found it right away. It's not like finding the Eiffel Tower. -No, it was easy. -Did you drive fast? Yes. Did you take a motorcycle or a little race car? No, just a car. -Feeling all right? -Yes, and you? President Rosko's always feeling great! Not too hot? Take off that jacket. Still the most handsome? Most handsome, most virile, and the coolest. President Rosko and his 15,000 listeners. We've got big news! Johnny doesn't know it yet, but I'm sure he's going to sign 25,000 photos tonight with your humble servant here. -What? -That's right. 25,000 copies! -Bye, bye. -No, I was kidding. 4,000, and Poupoune will give you a neck rub. -While you sign. -3,000? 3,000 it is! Let's discuss something else: I hear your latest record is great. Yeah, it's not bad. Sam's waving to me. I think he's ready now, right? I gave it to him when I got here. We can do something special with the record. -Sound good? -Okay. We're going to dedicate your record to Rosebud! -Who? -Rosebud! Man, you don't know Rosebud, the big race car? -No. -That's crazy, dude! Dear listeners, Johnny doesn't know Rosebud! Rosebud is the horse, the snail of the race. I'm telling you! Plus, this magnificent horse is sponsored by Ms. Shoura Cassidy. Who's that again? Shoura Cassidy, the most Irish Russian that America ever sent our way! But to think I pawned my Rolls to play on her nag, and tonight, I'm taking my bike… Everyone bet on Rosebud today! They'd have been better off playing Russian roulette! A horse that thinks it's an omnibus! It stops to let the faster ones go past! A cow in a horse race! -Shall we hear the new record? -Okay. Okay, man, here we go! Johnny's latest album, go! Hello? I don't want him talking about me anymore. I don't want him insulting my horse. You're my agent. Poor Shoura, it's not my fault that Rosebud was last by ten minutes. You're silly, Max. Mean and silly. I hate him! Besides, I saw him in a magazine, and he isn't even handsome. You let him say whatever he wants on that radio station. Don't give him so much freedom. You're in charge of the pirate station, so you're responsible! Rosebud is more than just a horse to me. The money doesn't matter. Money is no memento. But Rosebud is. This is your fault. You shouldn't haven't introduced him to his sister two days before. Incest wears people out, just like with horses. Dominique! Turn that music off! I think we've really got it. You bet. AIRPORT -Yeah? -Hello, Max. It's Bertrand. Did I wake you up? No, I'm up, as a matter of fact. If I had your alarm clock, I wouldn't feel so great. So, what's up? I'm going to London to deal with the Teenage Paradise folks. We're going to try to get 3,000 pounds per song, and-- 4,000 pounds! What? It'll cost them 4,000 pounds. They'll never go for that! I implied-- Look, if they don't like it, offer them the Ponies launch for ten days, free, minus costs, of course. I'll do my best. I left you the papers. Valerie will explain. We should try to get Shoura's check tomorrow. It's the 15th, and after Rosko's bit last night, we should try to be on time. Yeah. See you. My father is Russian. My mother is Russian. And I'm American. I know. But Rosko doesn't know! Could you turn that thing off for a moment? I have some papers for you to sign. That Max… Ever since we got engaged, he's just disappeared. I never see him anymore. Ten times a day, he calls me: "Great idea, wonderful, fantastic." And me? I'm stupid! And now he insults me on the radio with that Rosko! Who is so ugly! It's a good investment. But I didn't get engaged to make money! I make a lot more from my poor deceased husband's business. I got engaged because… Yes. Well, that's life. It's strange that you can't tell masculine from feminine. And yet you seem to be quite good with French. Oh, don't worry, Mr. Letellier. I know the difference quite well. Even worse. Here's the agreement from the Bank of Mexico. Here, thanks. And this is the purchase order for the stock in Malibu Electronics. Here's a letter for the finance minister of Paraguay. Thank you. And I need one last signature for the transfer of the Wichita oil wells. Why are we selling? Because our geologists say there's no more oil. Why are the others buying, then? Because they have bad geologists. Thanks. -See you soon. -Mr. Letellier… -Ms. Cassidy? -Tell me. Is it true that Max is doing well? Yes, business seems to be doing well. You'll get your check tomorrow, and it should be for more than the previous one. Thank you, Mr. Letellier. He was extraordinary. I think so, yes. Yes. Hello. I've told you what we wanted. Hello, Max. We needed something special, but natural. Look at this. If I wanted a monster, I'd have looked in the phone book. We needed a young aristocrat, that way we imagine her, not the way she is! Take that off. And these frills? Do you think we're in Sicily? There. There's nothing to cry about. The wig. The wig, you're right. This too. Start over. Be ready by three o'clock. Okay. You could have had a career in… What? -Ben-Hur's. -Very clever. It's photography I don't like. With this physique, this mindset, it's like an aircraft carrier with a Vespa motor. Find me when you're done. HOT DRINKS I feel great! Papers to sign? Nothing urgent. It can wait. But there's something that can't: it's about the magazine. I have three pages that need filling by Monday. Tell me darling, what if we did something on art for the Ponies to get them some money for vacation? Temp secretary, flying model, hostess-interpreter… Put Martine, and the new girl, the intern… -Catherine? -Yeah. Right. Martine and Catherine, and have Christian write it. Christian's too busy. Take Alain. He'll make it funny. Okay, Alain then. We need a few subjects for the next issue. Okay. Love in Paris. Where do people meet? How? Why? Marriage. Interview the priests, the mothers, the wedding dresses. Go see the local dressmakers, not the big names. I want young fiancées, dating agencies, caterers, hotels specializing in honeymoons. Anecdotes, unusual stuff, you know. Are blondes still in style? Are brunettes really more serious? Sociology. Get a psychologist's opinion. Love at the university. Are students more or less puritan than in the past? What do young girls dream about? No, we did that already. What do Ponies dream of? -Can I see? -Of course. What do you think? Much better, right? -Okay? Ciao. -Okay. Please, Ponette, make an effort! What's going on? Hey, Max! Ponette's being a prima donna again. You think this is fun? It's been two hours already. Poor thing… We're terrible to you. Sometimes the things that seem simplest are the most complicated to do. We can't photograph you in an aquarium. -Although… -Oh, no, Max! I spent all morning doing the set. Ponette's just sulking. Seems it's that kind of day. Tell me. Nothing. I'm just tired, that's all. And I feel ridiculous. You can't be ridiculous. You're much too pretty. Imagine the final photo: you… beautiful, nothing else. Not today. I'm not in the mood. Not in the mood? This is work. It has to get done. I'm just trying to explain that you have to try. For Jean-Claude, first of all, who worked his ass off on this. And for the three million Ponies who would love to be in your place! You're an idol, you know. People admire you, they want to be like you. They want to feel like they belong to something. Okay? -Feel better? -Yeah. It'll be all right. Say, you don't… I mean… You're not in trouble? No, don't worry. You should see your face! It's not unusual. -Ready? -Go for it, Max. Look up. Right leg, back. Let go! There! Perfect. Good. Lean in. Again. Good. Less stiff. There! You're beautiful. Smile. Don't move. There. Let go. There. There. People will dream about you. Max, can you hear me? -Oscar, the police are on the line. -What? The police are calling! I'll go. Follow me. Have a seat. FRENCH PASSPORTS Last name, first name. Kalamaéditis de Téites, Oscar. What did you say? -You asked for my name. -Repeat it. Kalamaéditis de Téites, Oscar. Spell it out. K-A-L-A-M-A… Slowly. Okay. K-A… M-A… D… I'll never get it right! Oh, sure you will. -I-T. -E. -E. -S. S. There! -There. -There. I told you we'd get it. Date of birth? January 15, 1944. Place of birth? Kiaotassi Metalo Padeca Popolis. Pachena canton. You… You're pulling my leg, aren't you? It's in Greece, sir. Ah, it's… Let's go, then. CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES POLICE STATION Sir, I'm Max Torp. What did he do now? Quite a lot. Corruption of a minor, assault, destruction of public property. Let's hear it. It's a misunderstanding. Jean-Claude asked me to find three Ponies who look alike for the twins photo. I found two last night at the club. I was supposed to pick them up this morning. Their father answered the door, and he got the wrong idea. Now that gentleman has two broken wrists, two dislocated shoulders, and three bruised ribs. It's not my fault, he went nuts! Thank you for letting me know. He's really a charming fellow. -He's a force of nature. -Ah… Yeah? I got him out for now, but they're pressing charges. He's not a man, he's a beast. Well, it is what it is. I have three lunches today, so that'll take a while. If Shoura calls, tell her whatever. See you. Stop at the corner. Take the car back, and don't handle anything, got it? Try not to breathe, even. Max? Wake up. Get up. You've got a meeting at ten. That's in a half an hour. I'm beat. Voltaire said that the greatest mistake in love is chastity. I think I need to start making some mistakes, then, if I want to survive. Okay. Call the paper. Conference at 2 p.m. Have everyone there. Okay! -Hi. -Hello, Max. We're going to do a special issue. Something on love, marriage, Paris, modern times. Valerie will do the first chapter. Then we'll have other subjects, like a psychology test: "What will he look like?" "What does he find attractive?" And then something on fidelity. We're pro-faithfulness. What a load of crap. My darling Valerie, there are three things that are entirely pointless: faithfulness in love, cod liver oil, and a degree in political science. That's my personal opinion. The magazine feels otherwise. Clear this up, and we'll meet later. -Take a look at this. -Not bad. Like it? She was great. She didn't move for two hours! Very good. When can you have this done? Two weeks. I need it in one. -It'll be tight, but we'll try. -See you. -How's it going? -Good. You look odd, though. Are you tired? A bit. Did you party again last night? Poor Max, how can you keep this up? I don't have much choice. I do get tired of it sometimes. Like today? Like today. If you took care of me, it'd be different. You need a nanny? -Not a nanny. -Oh? -Listen, Ponette… -Yes? We don't see enough of each other. We're always working so hard. I was thinking, we don't have time to hear ourselves think, and… You're the one who told me that work comes before fatigue. But it's no reason to make it a religion. And I didn't mean that. -Max? -Yeah? Did you think about recording the show? Yeah, I know. I'll let you work. Bye, Max. GLORY AT 16 YEARS OLD Blanchard! Max will like this. I'm not so certain. -Francis! -Yeah? What's going on? Are you kidding me? The cover is terrible. -You don't like it? -Not at all. It's not even a cover. I think it's a misunderstanding. I want something striking. I want these girls to discover Ponette. And you get a me a dress drowned in orangeade. Color, color… You asked for it. The color, for me, is Ponette, not the decor. GLORY AT 16 YEARS OLD Look. This is the Ponette spirit: color and beauty against all the gray. Where will you put the title? This week, no title. -Are you nuts? -Not one Ponette will be mistaken. I'm probably the only one who can get away with this. -I suppose you want it right away. -Yep. Irene, can you find me a spot for the photo of Happening? Near the end. What do you want for the caption? Same as always: "The jewel of Torp stables. Horse of the century." -Something modest. -That's life. Don't do it now. Meet me downstairs in the auditorium with the Ponies. -What for? -Surprise. Try that. Okay. One, two, three, four. We've gone through it ten times. Mr. Torp requests Daniel Gerard in his office. Mr. Torp requests Daniel Gerard in his office. What do you think of the melody? It needs more bass. -With psychedelic violins? -That's good. See the surprise? -Try it. -That's cool! Not bad. Great. -So? -Something worries me about Camille. What day do we have the Olympia? Thursday. All in one day. Can't we work it out with Coquatrix to have an extra day? Impossible. I already tried. Nothing doing. You know Coquatrix. Yep. But with Jojo, we'll never make it. We need at least one more day. Look, Max, it's not my fault. Want me to call Max or the boss? A coin. -Am I Cresus? -I know it's the end of the month. Another coin. -No. -Come on, one more. Nope. Come on. Ladies, please, be quiet. I'm going on the air. Ladies and gentlemen, hello. We're at the Pony Shop, the first outpost of a chain that will stretch all across France and Europe. What's a Pony Shop, you might ask? You can find all kinds of things: gadgets, posters… On the posters, we have: Mrs. Sax on a Harley Davidson. "Okay, we're coming," etc. I can't quite give you the colors because radio isn't in color yet. There are tons of charming girls. And I spot Mr.… I see Max Torp, with Paul or Karl… Paul or Karl… Schulitzer! Paul or Karl Schulitzer, the king of gadgets! What a galaxy, ladies and gentlemen! My friend, how are you? Max, a word for Radio Happening, the best of the pirate stations. Why did you make the Pony Shop? So that everyone can enjoy the Pony style, quite simply. Remember this: Pony yourself up! We'll be creating our own money. Ten ponies will be worth one argos. Thank you very much. We'll be leaving Pony Shop number one. Thank you for the warm welcome, Mr. Max Torp. Goodbye, and see you soon, I hope. Back to the studio. Give me your hat, please. Do something! Ponette? Oscar. Would you lend me your skirt? Oh, my! There. I'll give it back right away. Oscar! Max! Do you think this style will be popular? This is the cover of our next issue. Hang on. -Still a kid, eh? -He always does that in the water. He says it relaxes him. Hey, wait! Want to do me a favor? Sure. Put your head under water and count to 3,000. Slowly. Very funny. I'm kidding. Count to 2,000. Really? Didn't you say you wanted to do me a favor? -Yeah. -Well? He's nuts. Shall I do your feet, your hands, or something more intimate? Feet, as usual. It's going to be a crazy night. I'm bringing all the bigwigs from Europe, America, and elsewhere. 2,000! 2,000! How do you see it? -I'm going to get some dancers. -Yeah. I have an idea. I'm going to paint them gold and silver. The girls. -Yeah. -So they glimmer under the lights. -What do you say? -Um… Their faces and bodies. I'd go further. I see you all made up in gold… The singer in gold… With a big wig. A big metal wig. That'd be funny. Let's try it. Hey! -Guys? -Yeah. You know the great painter who owed it all to his mother? Ask advertising for the portfolio through to year end. Yeah. I'll be at there in an hour. Have him wait for me. Valerie? I just heard some singers on the quay. Three men and a woman. Get me their info. I have an idea. Okay. Hello, finally. -How are you? -You've become rather scarce. What's going on? -Lots of work, sir. -Oh, work. What a terrible word. It ages a man. Well, I'm not quite there. But you're young, my boy! Work gives you wrinkles. I'll just get used to it. Oh, out of the question. Hello, Shoura. Oh, douchka, how are you? Good. I bet the boss was hitting on you again. He has a weakness for you. You call that a weakness? Max, you're impossible! You'll never be good. -When I'm good, it'll be time to die. -Oh… Please. Don't talk that way, darling. Why? Are you good? It's different for me. Again? If I hadn't lived differently, I wouldn't live the way I do. Translate as you wish. My dear prince, would you check on dinner? He's adorable, but… he's a pain in the neck. Right? Yes. Max, I'm not pleased with you. No, it's not about Rosebud. That's in the past. It's about something else. Max… I helped you out a great deal. I know. Without you, the pirate radio station, the magazine, the company: none of that would exist. I'm very grateful for all that. But grant me this. I didn't get you involved in a bad business. Oh, always business! Darling. Why won't you come home, like before? That's ancient history. Let's not start. You have your occupations, I have mine. We're the best of friends, and believe me, friendship lasts longer than all the rest. I don't want friendship! I want something else. Oh, you Americans, when you get something into your head… Oh, don't worry about my head. The head… When I pay for something, I want it. No, not with me, Shoura. For that kind of thing, you have Domino. We made a deal. You were to be paid in cash, not in kind. -Hey. -Hi. What are you going to do with that? I was worried. -How did it go? -Same as always, or worse. Here, read this. They really got you this time. -What are they saying now? -Everything. Orgies at the house, a harem at the office, minors getting drunk, LSD flowing freely. All kinds of stuff that could hurt us. We should sue! That's insane. That's the last thing we should do. Why? Because some of it's false, but some of it is true, too. Well, the way they write it, they can always say it's true. Last time, they wrote, "It's all over between Brigitte Bardot and Max Torp." I've never met her in my life. But on page eight, they wrote that nothing could happen between us, because I like garlic and she hates it. -This is more serious. -Yeah, right… -I'm serious. -Leave me alone! I've had enough. I want his head. If you want to cause Mr. Torp trouble, I think we have what we need. But I think it'd be the wrong move. His businesses are doing well. Are you sure you…? I want his head. His head. "All sums advanced by Mrs. Cassidy to Mr. Torp will be immediately due for repayment without notice and in their entirety." I doubt that he can pay you back, but it's plainly spelled out. You think that's enough to have his head? I don't know about having his head, as you say, but it could cause him some trouble. I suppose he'll go to the banks. Can we make it so the banks won't help him? We can. And then? Then? Then, you'll be put in charge of the whole thing. What will you do? I'm going to do something. Ah… I'll have his head. Oh, the bastards. ORGIES AT PONY MAGAZINE The bastards! The bastards! We'll have an ad truck in Bordeaux, the day before the gala. It has to leave before the show's over to be in Toulon the next morning. We could record both songs in the truck. I can't tomorrow. I'm recording in London. Will you be back for the evening? I'd never miss a night like that. Max! -Yes? -Bertrand's on the phone. -Take it in my office. -Thanks. Bertrand? Yes. Oh, damn… Well, work it out with the bank. You're in trouble. -Yeah. -Big time? -Huge. -That bad? I don't know what to do. What if I was on a horse? Isn't it a bit crude? Maybe. Don't get upset. You young people, you're always taking off so fast, and then you freak out like kids at the slightest mishap. I'd like to see you in my shoes. I've been in your shoes, and more often than you think. Can I do something? Be a doll and clear the stage. -Photographers, please. -Thanks. If you need me… Some days, it's best to stay in bed. I'll see you later. Is it a secret? No use talking about it. Once it's going to be a catastrophe… This is what I can't stand about you. You always want to be the lonely genius in his ivory tower. It was another time. -Not again with that. -I know. Faithfulness in love is one of the three useless things on this earth. Not everyone is like you. ORGIES AT PONEY MAGAZINE MAX TORP AND LSD Let's go. Hey! Hello. -How are you? -Great, but I'm dead tired. Did it go well? Max, this is Patrick. -Hello. -Hello, sir. Corinne told me about you. Corinne? That's my name. Did you forget already? No. I'm just so used to calling you Ponette or Totoche. Yes, but those are my pseudonyms. I have a personal life too, you know. Are you coming, Patrick? Bye, sir. See you. -Who's this Patrick? -Who? -The guy I just saw with Ponette. -It's her boyfriend. I think it might be kind of serious. He's a charming young man. You know him? Yes, why? You never mentioned it to me? Ponette's fooling around with someone I don't know of? He's a nice boy. He's in med school. I don't give a damn. What did you mean by serious? I think it's serious, that's it. -"I think it's serious…" You're absurd. -Max! What? -Are you jealous? -Are you nuts? I don't care about him! Yes? One moment. Be right back. So… Thanks. Something's wrong. Shoura pulled her money, and the banks aren't helping. The bailiffs are lining up outside my office. I'm done for, man. You're kidding. The great Max Torp. Impossible. I don't know much about your business, but there's got to be some way out. Do something. -I've got nothing. -Happening, and your stables. -What am I supposed to do? -Hang on. I've got an idea. -Ask for Jean-Charles Cornfield. -Jean-Charles? Think he can pay cash? Let me take care of it. Property owners, even friends, must be manipulated. -Tactfully. -Be discreet, or everyone will know. Don't worry, you can count on me. This isn't your usual hour, Mr. Torp. Sure, but not for getting up. How's Happening? You can see for yourself. He's great. How much is he worth? I timed him at 53,5, but he can do much better. That's not what I mean. I don't understand. Never mind. See you later. HOT DRINKS What are you doing? Packing my things. Why? -I'm leaving. -Where for? Anywhere you aren't. -What's gotten into you? -I've had enough! I'm sick of being treated like an object to be mistreated and despised! I quit. Since you're so great, you'll be just fine without me. I don't ever want to see you again, Max. Ah… It's you. So? So, it's a catastrophe. I tried everything, to no avail. Come in. -Tell me. -The bank will help us out on one-- Are you listening? -Yes, you don't have to shout. -On one condition. They'll help us out as long as Shoura guarantees the loan. She'll never do it. I figured. And that's not all. Complaints have been filed against the club. The situation isn't looking good. And the DA is pressing charges. Thanks to your good friend Oscar's work. Is that all? Is that not enough? If we don't get out of this, we're done for. Things can still work out. They'd better. We're bankrupt, on our way to prison, so things had better work out, yes. -What did we do to deserve this? -No! What did you do? You didn't play by the rules. You moved too fast. You stepped on people's toes. You crushed them. -Right in your path. -What can we do? You have to patch things up with Shoura. If we save the magazine, we save everything. If the magazine goes under, we may as well burn it all down. -She has to withdraw the summons. -Okay. So. The little shindig you put together: we have to use it. Get some sleep. -I'll call Shoura to tell her to come-- -She'll never come. Poor Max. You're full of ideas when things are going well, but when things are bad, you turn into such an idiot. Get some sleep. Let me handle it. Sleep 24 hours. You're going to need your strength. Want to sit down? Thank you. You're not upset anymore? Me? Oh, no. -Not anymore. -You're not mad at me? Not at all. I was before. Now it's over. I behaved like an idiot. -All this work… -Oh… Poor douchka. You need a vacation. Shoura, you're wonderful. If you knew the day I'd had… Poor Max… Get me some more champagne. Thank you. See, Shoura, the magazine, if I lose it, I'll lose everything. I don't want you to lose. -Really? -Yes. You have no idea how happy that makes me. Want anything else? Right away. So? So, it's all worked out. Just like that? Yep. I told you. You can't bury Torp that easily. Bertrand and I have a payment plan worked out. We'll submit it to Letellier tomorrow. I think that in a year from now, you'll have your entire down payment back. Max, I don't want the money back. I insist. It's not worth it. Don't pay me back. -Or I won't be in control anymore. -I don't follow. It was in Madagascan erotism that I found the basis for my great work: a painting of 285 by 183 feet representing the union of cosmic values with the intercommunication of philosophical symbols of slightly moldy Gruyère cream. I don't know how to run a magazine. So you'll run it, and I'll give you orders. What kind of orders? I see. "Stand up," "shake," "sit," "lie down." Especially "lie down," right? Max… I'd rather die, you hear me? I made this magazine! I thought of it for years before I did it. It's mine, don't you see? Otherwise it's nobody's. Especially not yours. Shoura, you know how important the magazine is to me. You can't do this to me. I can't? Listen, Max, I'm taking control of the magazine, and you work for me. You're going to be my employee. Bastard! Asshole! Don't drink that much. You're scaring me. Come with me. Lie down. I've never seen you like this. No, let me go! I don't have the plague! I'm going to marry Patrick. I wanted to tell you tonight. -Patrick? -Yes, I love him. Understand? No, you can't understand. You've never loved anyone. All you care about is your magazine. You made me into an object for it! But Patrick loves me. Understand? I think we should do something for him. An auction would be appropriate. Ladies, is there a woman among you who has had enough of friendship to come to his aid? I'm asking you out of the goodness of your hearts, ladies. Bravo! Irene, don't make me beg. You're delightful, and besides, you have a big heart. He's not able to do anything. The situation is desperate. He should have come to me. There might be another way. Whatever you can. Yes. Charles and Johnny have 10 million each. With mine, it'll be 30. We can't let them down. Congratulations! Who wants more? I'm confident. Thanks. -So? -Five more. We're not quite out of the woods. Who's next on the list? Lucien Maurice. Hi. Is this your car? It's beautiful. Can I look at it? Can I get in? At the first bell, it was 7:30. Now the news. Good morning, Patrick. Morning, all. Still no news of the three young Italian mountain climbers on the north face of the Grandes Jorasses. Police helicopters continue to search, and a search party left Chamonix this morning to reinforce the first search party which has been out since yesterday afternoon. In Pittsburgh, interracial violence has gotten worse. Three dead and 48 wounded since this morning. The state's governor has declared a state of emergency and martial law. Now for sports. Before that, though, here is a personal message: "Bertrand and Valerie ask Max to come back. It's all been worked out." I repeat: "Bertrand and Valerie ask Max to come back. It's all been worked out." -Are you leaving? -Yeah. Come. You're bothering the gentleman. You'll come back, right? -Surely. -Bye. Subtitle translation by: Adam Lozier
