[ Narrator ] THIS COULD BE THE ROOM OF ANY SMALL BOY, BUT IT HAPPENS TO BELONG TO CHRISTOPHER ROBIN. LIKE MOST SMALL BOYS, CHRISTOPHER ROBIN... HAS MANY STUFFED ANIMAL FRIENDS. AND TOGETHER, THEY HAVE MANY REMARKABLE ADVENTURES... IN AN ENCHANTED PLACE CALLED THE HUNDRED ACRE WOOD. NOW, HIS BEST FRIEND IS A CERTAIN LITTLE BEAR, AND ONE OF THE GRANDEST OF THEIR MANY GRAND ADVENTURES... BEGAN AROUND AND ABOUT THIS DAY. A MOST DELIGHTFUL TIME OF CANDIES AND CARDS, A DAY OF VALENTINES. [ Owl Hooting ] BUT HAPPY AS IT WAS, THE DAY BROUGHT WITH IT A CERTAIN UNCERTAINTY, FOR THIS WAS ALSO A TIME OF CHANGE, AND CHANGE DOES NOT COME EASILY FOR SOME BEARS, ESPECIALLY A BEAR NAMED WINNIE THE POOH. CHRISTOPHER... ROBIN? BOTHER. HE'S ALWAYS HERE... EXCEPT FOR THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN HE ISN'T. WHICH MUST MEAN HE IS... [ Gasps ] ELSEWHERE! - [ Knocking On Door ] - PIGLET! PIGLET, ARE YOU THERE, OR THEREABOUT? [ Stammering ] OH, NO, POOH. I-I-I MEAN, UH, YES, POOH. I MEAN... [ Stammering ] PERHAPS I'LL BE IN LATER? WHOOPS! [ Stammering ] OH, DEAR! D-D-D-DEAR! HAVE YOU SEEN CHRISTOPHER ROBIN THIS MORNING? OH, N-NO, POOH BEAR. NOT THIS MORNING. OR THE MORNING BEFORE. OR THE AFTERNOON AFTER THE DAY BEFORE. YES, IT'S TRUE. HE HASN'T BEEN BY MUCH AT ALL LATELY, HAS HE? I DO WONDER WHAT MIGHT BE THE MATTER. PERHAPS HE'S BUSY WITH SOMETHING. MAYBE... A SURPRISE? [ Thud ] MAYBE. MAYBE NOT. DEPENDING. - ON WHAT? - YES, ON WHAT. AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE THERE, PIGLET? WHERE? I-I MEAN, UH, WHERE? [ Stammering ] I DON'T SEEM TO SEE ANYTHING. [ Chuckles ] THERE. THIS? OH, THIS. [ Chuckles ] WELL, I, UH... I WAS MAKING A VALENTINE'S CARD, POOH BEAR. FOR YOU. OH, THAT'S QUITE NICE OF YOU, PIGLET. - BUT VALENTINE'S ISN'T TILL... - TOMORROW. YOU MEAN VALENTINE'S FALLS ON TOMORROW THIS YEAR? WELL, PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT CHRISTOPHER ROBIN IS UP TO. HE MUST BE MAKING VALENTINES FOR US ALL. [ Narrator ] AND SO POOH AND HIS FRIENDS WENT TO FIND THE BOY. BUT WHAT THEY FOUND WAS VERY STRANGE INDEED. [ Grunting ] UM, EXCUSE ME. I BEG YOUR PARDON. WHAT DO WE SEE? WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? OHH, WOULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT? WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S HE DOING? OH, MY. LOOK NOW. DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A THING? WHA... SUCH A THING AS WHAT? BY DINGHY, HE'S WRITING SOMETHING. UM, WHICH PARTICULAR SOMETHING IS HE WRITING? DEAR... - [ Gasps ] HE'S WRITING TO A DEER! I'LL BET YOU A BUCK HE'S FAWNING OVER SOME DOE. [ Chuckles ] UH, MORE LETTERS. "W..." "I." "N." - [ Gasps ] - OH, WHAT COULD IT BE? IT'S YOUR NAME. HE'S SPELLING W-I-N-N... UH, THE POOH. [ Clears Throat ] OH. [ Chuckles ] THAT'S HOW I SPELL IT TOO. "DEAR WINIFRED." - W-WINIFRED? - WINIFRED? - WINNIE THE WHO? - WINNIE FRED. BUT... WHAT PRECISELY... IS A WINIFRED, EXACTLY? A WINIFRED, MY DEAR FRIEND, IS A GIRL. A GIRL? A G-GIRL. - A G-G-G-GIRL? - A WHAT? A GIRL! IT'S LIKE A BOY, ONLY NOT, IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN. OH.

[ Huffs ] WELL, THEN WE MUST GET HIM TO A DOCTOR! OH, MY DEAR BEAR. THE SMITTEN IS MERELY A MEMBER OF THE LOVE BUG FAMILY. OH, D-D-D-DEAR. - WHATEVER SHALL WE D-DO? - WE MUST PROCEED WITH CAUTION. LOVESICKNESS, SO I'VE HEARD, IS VERY SERIOUS AND HIGHLY CATCHING. THEN WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING, AND DO IT FAST! I GOT IT! WE GOTTA GO AND GET ANOTHER SMITTEN TO UNSMITE HIM! NONSENSE, TIGGER.

BE AS HE WAS. [ Narrator ] AND OFF THEY WENT IN SEARCH OF THE CREATURE. AND THEY SEARCHED... AND THEY SEARCHED, UNTIL AT LAST, THEY FOUND THEMSELVES DEEP IN THE UNKNOWN HEART... OF THE HUNDRED ACRE WOOD. OOH. OH, IT'S ALMOST VALENTINE'S, AND I DON'T THINK WE SHALL EVER FIND THIS SMITTEN. WHY, IT COULD BE IN MOST ANY PART OF ANYWHERE. I DO HOPE THESE S-S-SMITTENS... AREN'T F-F-F-FIERCE CREATURES. [ Owl Hooting ] AAH! OH, SMITTENS ARE MONSTROUS THINGYS, ALL RIGHT. ONE BITE AND THEN... AAH! AAH! AND, UH... AND, UH... I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
