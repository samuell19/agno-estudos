Take a wild guess. Ms. HAN, your phone. I'm sorry. Dammit, shoot it! Stop hitting me! Look at this! Give it! Give it to me! HAN Seo-rin, you will obey my orders. Mina? Are you home? Sleeping? How was school? Were you at internet café all day? Dinner? Freaking prick... Who are you? The one who knows your secret. This past Wednesday? You were the after school supervisor. Why, something wrong? No, nothing like that. Vice principal, the gardeners are here. Are they? Sir. Could I check the CCTV from Wednesday night? I sent a memo about CCTVs being down for maintenance. That's this week. Oh... Ms. HAN, what's with you? Are you really okay? Yes, I'm fine. Isn't that your phone? What? It's okay. Why aren't you going home? - Mom? - Yeah? Can't we move? What for? Just... Did you fight with your friends? Can't we live in Seoul too? Did something happen at school? Of course not. You've been in your room, never saying much, even a sleepover. It's nothing like that! Then what is it? I'll head home, I got homework. - Seo-rin? - Yes? My dream was to make a family of teachers. So I tried so hard to make him into one, but he was never interested in studying. Not this again? You talk to her about this every time you see her. But I get reminded every time I see her. Isn't that right? Sure. What color undies are you wearing? What is it? It's nothing. Hi, Mina. It's been a while. Why are you here? I couldn't reach you, I was worried. You said you live here since a kid. And you loved snack so much that your mom opened a snack shop. What's it called again? Stop it! What's wrong? People might think I'm bullying you. We had fun, didn't we? Making me feel bad. I won't tell anyone... I'll take it to my grave, I'll never tell a soul... So please, forget what happened. I'm begging you... You want to forget? Me? You broke our promise today, you need to be punished. I'm sorry, I really am! If you don't drink this, I'll share your video with your school tomorrow. Drink. Don't forget. You're my plaything. And I'm your master, got it? Ready. Action. What's this? What is it? Teacher H's erotic photo? Crazy bastards. That's pornographic spam. Why was that sent to you? It's not sent to a select few. They send it to everyone. Even to the grade schoolers. My gosh... Kids can't see stuff like that. Kids today aren't as naïve as you think. Right? Excuse me. Are you disobeying me? Should I reveal who H is? People nowadays... Not asleep yet? No, mom. Did the dinner with Woo-hyuk's parents go well? Yeah. What's with your voice? Are you sick? I'm okay. By the way, do you still have that man's number? That man? Who? OH Kook-chul. Bastard, you can't just go in like that! Screw you! Shut your face! What a pathetic loser. If you're gonna screw around, get lost! You rascals! Aren't you a potty mouth? This is internet café, not a freaking toilet! Idiots... And why the hell aren't you in school? It's Sunday. Then go to church, brats. Pray and go to heaven. What a loser. That's it! What did you just say? This is no smoking area, go put out your smoke! It's okay, bastard, I'm the boss here. Hey, don't let them in again. I wonder what you'll grow up to be. Goddammit! Yo, come clean this up! I spilled it. Hello? Hello? Why isn't he talking? Hurry the hell up! Always asking for a raise and stuff. Get that corner too! Go away, we got a customer. Welcome. Who... I'm Det. OH Kook-chul. Are you Mrs. HAN Soon-jung? Yes, what brings you here? Your child YOO Mina goes to Yangpyeong High? Yes. Could we sit down for a moment? I didn't recognize you. You're a city gal now. This town never changes, same old stuff. When did you leave the force? A few years ago. Is that new? That's a cute phone. I've been using this flip phone for 6 years... Remember KIM Jin-ho? Could you look into him? I'll arrest the suspect before the media picks up this story. I trust you, detective! Get these bastards. I'll do my best. HB Daily News Reporter CHOI That's an ancient case. Please don't ask and look into it for me. YOO Mina! HB Daily News CHOI Gyu-dong All 5 students involved in high school gang rape in Yangpyeong were charged. For tying the victim to a chair and controlling her, so called 'Marionette' video was burn to a CD and sold by the suspects. This case received national attention after it was picked up by a reporter. It's okay, baby. Next news... It's alright... It was supposed to be a closed investigation, but I'd like to apologize for the internal leak. The press will be all over you, you should relocate to the city... What's wrong? Mina! She's acting up, get her to the hospital! Go to the ER! Okay, okay. I'm going. Are you okay? It's alright. Det. MOON. Where are you, sir? Waiting for you, why aren't you coming? I was about to leave, we got a call for support. Let's move. You go ahead. Send the fax. Am I nothing because I lost the badge? I haven't been home in 3 days. My wife's pestering me about making her a widow. First world problems, eh? Anyway, that guy you asked for, KIM Jin-ho. Didn't he get arrested for making kiddie porn? How do you know that? You talked about it whenever you got drunk. You said that case bothered you. So what happened to him? He's a wanted man. What? Wanted? Favorites Woo-hyuk: Pls reply! Get my present in the storage tomorrow. Action! YOO Mina is HAN Seo-rin. KIM Jin-ho, bastard. WANTED!!! He's a wanted man... Screw this... She should've left this alone. Didn't like the present? I'm disappointed. Unlike Mencius' innate goodness, Xun Kuang insisted on the evil. It states that human nature is fundamentally evil, prioritizing personal gain and pleasure, and filled with envy and hate, so persistent quarrel when left alone. In order to correct oneself, one must cultivate oneself morally. You disobeyed, so you'll be punished. You disobeyed, so you'll be punished. Here's a special event for students in class 3. Who is the girl in the following photo? It was sent to all of us. Who's 'Master'? What the hell is this? What photo is he talking about? How did he get our numbers? Turn your phones off. Turn it off! We're in class! YANG Se-jung Put your phones on the desk! Dong-jin, collect and bring them to the staff room! The number you've dialed cannot be reached right now... - Ms. HAN! - Yes? We looked everywhere, she's not here. Yeah? Ma'am, Ji-min spotted her at a park near complex 2. - The park? - Yes. Should I report? I'll be all over the news, and people will find out. Let's get some rest and think about it. But I have to know what's going on, can you tell me what happened? I got a text few days ago, when I was heading home. From who? Master. And? It asked me to come to the storage for a present. I thought it was a prank, so I went there. There was a drink, and when I woke up... Did you see who it was? There were several of them. I couldn't tell who was who. I was scared... It's okay, Se-jung. I know how you feel. Why are you so jumpy? It's nothing. Where have you been? You didn't answer my call. I waited outside for a long time. Why're you here? You forgot the meeting with wedding planner. Something came up at school, sorry. They said kids nowadays are scary, but why did she have to go get herself harassed? So, did you report? No, not yet. Why not? We want to look into it further. What's the use? Just report it. It's not so clear-cut from her perspective. If there's a video, it should be online by now. Maybe they were after making money on porn sites. They wouldn't just keep it. Don't waste time on those kids, report and get it over with. "Those kids"? The guys who shot the video are the real bad guys, but maybe the girl was asking for it too. It's so obvious. What should we do then? About what? If it's online already, what about her? I mean, what should the girl do? It's pretty clear, life's over for her. Do you think the pic was Se-jung? Her name tag was visible, it's definitely her. Why would she burst into tears? Yeah... I wonder who took the pictures. - I know. - Who? - KIM Dong-jin. - Serious? He lives next apartment over, I saw him with Se-jung often. Holy cow, I got goosebumps! Something happened between the two. What could it be?! Stop it! You're all seniors now, stay focused, and prep for the finals. Okay. I want to repeat once more, please keep silent about yesterday's incident. - The victim isn't verified. - It's Se-jung. - Got it? - Yes, ma'am. Rep? Attention. Greet the teacher. Thank you. Se-jung, could we talk? How was today? You know... feels like being bullied on. You did well. I wouldn't have endured that. How'd you have handled it? Well... I would want to hide, or deny that it was me. I don't want to be a coward. I won't become someone else by doing that. Se-jung, Could I ask you about your relationship with Dong-jin? I saw you two fight in front of the dumpster. I overheard that you two are close too. It might not be him, but I... It was a year ago. I really... liked him. I was so excited when we got into the same class. Do you still like me? Why? Can you do something for me? What is it? So sexy. Am I pretty? Have you ever done it? It? Kiss? No, not that. Wanna do it? Now? You don't believe me? I believe you. But it's so different from how he is in class. I know. He's studious and from a good family. But that was nothing. His computer... I saw how guys hide porn online. I was gonna find his and tease him... But they were all girls my age. I didn't know it then but he shot a video too. You erased all my photos and videos on my PC. Why shouldn't I? You don't think I made copies? What do you mean? Do I look like an idiot? I'll tell your parents and teachers about what you did. Bitch! I got something fun planned out for you, let's see if you're so proud afterwards. You can never talk to Dong-jin. Don't worry. Have you ever heard of the name KIM Jin-ho? Maybe Dong-jin texted or called him. KIM Jin-ho? No, never heard of him. Who is he? It's nothing. Seo-rin, open up! Are you really not home? Seo-rin! Have you looked into KIM Jin-ho? Hello? Hello? Hello? What I asked... KIM Jin-ho? I did. I looked into it. If I filled you in, I need to know why. What? What if you do something stupid? Then I could be screwed too. I think I made a mistake, forget about everything. Wait, wait, wait. So impatient. He's gone. He's wanted for some crime. Spit it out. Did he do something to you lately? It's nothing like that. I was a cop for 20 years. I think I momentarily lost my head. It was all in the past, sorry for bothering you, forget everything. Dong-jin's meeting someone later, could it be KIM Jin-ho? Yeah? Do you know where? No... What should I do? I'll look into it and call you later. Woo-hyuk Congrats on your new life! Fine. I'm gonna get you! - You bitch! - Dammit! Run, bastard! Get her! How is she so fast! Go after her! Stop! She's too fast! What the hell! Bastard! Get up! Go that way! Find the bitch! What the hell... What are you doing? Let's get you patched up. That's temporary, go to the ER tomorrow. Since when? It hasn't been long since we crossed paths again. I said we should drop it. I wish I could, but I just can't. It's okay, I'm gonna call the cops. You should've done that, why contact me? Could've asked them about KIM Jin-ho too. Didn't you come to me because you can't? I'm gotta go home. Now I'm more certain since you were chased by them. Certain about what? If I'm honest, will you too? About what? I was the one who leaked your case. I looked out for a few illegal adult arcades, and a reporter threatened me. He was after the force, I had to give him something. I'm sorry. My conscience won't let me look the other way. You can't solve this alone. Come clean and we can work this together. Must feel nice to let all that out. I'm sorry. I'm fine. Have a good life, I won't resent you. I got it! All-In Love Motel You son of a bitch! Why're you hitting me?! Hey! Drinking and screwing at your age, are you proud? Answer my questions properly. Got it? Who's the hoodie you were with? What? The hoodie, bastard! Dong-jin. What's his full name? KIM Dong-jin. Is he your group's boss? I'm the boss. He's a nobody without his dad. His dad? His dad is chief prosecutor. Chief prosecutor... Are you a cop? Why did you chase after the woman at the karaoke? Look at me, Bastard! Why chase her? The boys ran after her, so I followed them. Son of a bitch! You deserve a proper beating. Master ordered us! What? Master of what? Master. Master? He's a foreigner? I don't know who he is, we just get texts and e-mails from him. He said she was after us, so he told us to shoot her. Shoot? Shoot what? Video. Video? Get up! Get up, bastard! Run that way. Run over there, bastard! Faster, bastard! - He's over here! - You bastard! Det. OH Scientifically Solves Infamous 'Marionette' Case HB Daily News CHOI Gyu-dong You didn't have to come down here for me. Are you an investigator now? Why're you so up and about? I know, eh? Remember Soranet? Your favorite porn site. Bastard... I'm too old for this. A month ago, KIM Dong-jin and co. got caught while uploading videos to Soranet. Brought in a few minors for uploading porn? The problem was, students were the victims. From elementary to high school, they were stripping and stuff, it was insane. Were they charged? KIM got a slap on the wrist and was released. So did the rest for being minors and first time offenders. They're just pawns, there's someone behind... Master. How did you know about him? I got my ways. He's uploading kiddie porn to Soranet and others, it's not easy getting to him. How does he lure them? Probably money. Then track their accounts. We tried everything. As expected, he used burner phones and accounts. He got a whiff of it and went dark. Remember KIM Jin-ho? Could you look into him? He told us to shoot her. Shoot what? Video. The problem was, students were the victims. From elementary to high school, they were stripping and stuff, it was insane. Okay, nice. Answer for the last time, it's important. Hello? I know you can't trust me and hate me to death. But you can't get through this alone. Is KIM Jin-ho back? KIM or Master, I don't care, is he threatening you? I found out something about Master. Let's talk about this. So he got to you again? Now your student too? Master, that psycho bitch. What's clear is that this prick KIM Dong-jin is linked to Master, but we're not sure if KIM Jin-ho is Master. So it could be someone else? Right, it's an old case, but it was a huge scandal... I'm sorry. Stupid tongue... Why did you follow KIM Dong-jin? Hoping to find a clue. Don't ever do that again. If you were caught, you coulda been shot again. Shot again? Video. Those bitches knew you were on their tail. So Dong-jin knows? Not him, Master found out and ordered them. Master? Yeah. Only you, me and Se-jung know about this. Se-jung? Have you been in contact with her afterwards? No. Her phone's off, she won't reply to my texts. I don't believe this. I hope Master didn't do anything... What if something happened to her? Go home. I'll dig around on my own, stay home and keep calling her. When you get through, call me right away. - Got it? - Okay. Go home. Parking pass please. Here you go. Oh no, she passed out. Seo-rin! What's wrong?! Get up! Are you okay? NEW Marionette COMING SOON New Marionette video will be broadcasted live tomorrow Someone call 911! Will you be okay? It's all bulls***. The thing about live broadcast is... it's impossible. If he's doing this because of me, I'll do whatever it takes... Seo-rin! Stay home, don't meet anyone! I'll catch that bastard! Don't worry! What are you saying? I checked out the Soranet link you sent. It's from an overseas IP, so it'll be hard to track. So what exactly are you good for then?! We can track it, but it'll take time. No way! Track him by tomorrow at any cost! Why are you so gung-ho about catching Master? How could you get another job without telling me! What a freaking idiot! This stupid phone won't last half a day! Dammit! Goddammit! We're closed today. Hey, Det. OH, it's been a while. Dear Mom Master sent a video. Ms. HAN! Help me! I'm scared! Who will go live on the air? You or her? LOL. Go to Guro district 432-1. Seems like you're onto something big. Let me get a piece too. You're getting ahead of yourself. Tell me what you got. I got an e-mail yesterday. It was about remaking 2002's Marionette video. It said my article was a big help. It gave me a link to a website. Stuff on it brought back so many memories. Oh, it really took me back! Which site? Let me take a look, I'm bored as hell. We're both pros. How do you think I came here? The e-mail didn't contain just the URL. This was hard to come by, so keep this to yourself. Absolutely! This is a bad spot to chat, - let's go somewhere quiet. - Very good. How'd you have handled it? I would want to hide, or deny that it was me. I don't want to be a coward. I won't become someone else by doing that. Dear Mom Son of a bitch! Detective! What's going on?! What's going on? You bitch! Time for a good beating! You caused enough trouble! Bastard! And you want some more? You bastard, if you write that article, I'll really screw you up, got it? Yes. Answer louder! Yes! What the hell... Damn... Bastard... Your call cannot be... Se-jung's in danger, please hurry! Guro district... Goddammit... Be a superstar again. Did you get my text? Get everyone to that address! I'm gonna go first and buy some time! Say what? There's no time to report to the chief! 2 women are being sexually assaulted now! Master has a childish taste. Do I have to wear this? Then take it off, bastard, let the world see you. Don't be so dramatic. Dong-jin? She got you, dong lover! Why are you doing this? I had no choice. Where's Se-jung? Is she okay? Se-jung? Let's bring her out. YANG Se-jung! Ms. HAN! Where are you? Please help me! Are you okay? Are you hurt? I want to go home! I'm here, so let her go! Did you hear that?! She wants us to let you go! Se-jung? Are you free? Hi, here I am. How else would I just walk out, bitch! Master warned you, didn't he? He said not to tell anyone. Then... those photos... You thought that was really me? There are plenty of bitches who'll do anything for booze. Dong-jin's my avatar. It was amazing that you figured us out. Can you do something for me? You said you'll delete mine if I helped with the HAN video. That was just a trailer, the main event hasn't even started yet. You didn't say that before! I don't freaking know! I won't get the money if I don't. I was taken to the police for uploading for you. You want me to do this again? Should I upload yours too? Act properly after sending pics to the group chat. Don't get caught and mess stuff up. I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd go this far. Buzz off. So, you're Master. Wrong! I bet you wished it to be true. But it was hard being a go-between. People nowadays... You're all being used too. We don't care about that. We just want the money. I'll make you regret this. Regret? Can you really? You changed your name, and live in hiding. The you that I know could never do that. They're all telling us to start the show! Alright, we'll now begin Marionette's live broadcast. YOO Mina That's enough, you brats! You're young enough to wear diapers. I'll make you bleed in your diapers. Watch your tone, bastard. This cop's trembling. Should we stick a pipe up him? Cops! Stop! Get him! Get up, get up. Careful now. Those bastards came at me with knives... I coulda killed them. Just relax! That hurts! Let go of me! Let go! How dare you! You bitch! Ma'am! Ma'am! Stop it! Stop, stop! Can't you zip up? It hurts! So, who's Master? Master? He's... Master's not here. Seo-rin! This is Se-jung's phone, it's a text from Master. This is Master's number? Yes. Get this to the station and track this number, and get ready to mobilize! Lock these kids up! Detective, I'd like to come. I feel you, but it's dangerous... I need to see who it is. You need to get treated first. - Where's her coat? - Here it is. - I have to go. - Okay, good work. You can't do anything over there. How did you untie yourself? We tracked the number and alternate IP routing, and we got an address. The suspect is named JO Young-je. He has 2 prior charges for distributing burner phones and accounts. Okay, what's the address? Dongjak district, 5-15, JO Young-je, 42. Come alone! Do you have to go? Is that him? Yeah. JO Young-je? Police. Get him! I should buy a GPS, where am I? Where you going? Seo-rin! Seo-rin! Hey! Wait for me! Hey, hey! Get the car! - Which way? - Over there! Hey! Stop! Det. KANG? Where's MOON? He's in pursuit. - Is that right? - Wanna hop in? No, get him to call me when you get him. - Yes, sir! - Alright, good luck! Son of a bitch... But why... Come here. I've been looking for you. I'm serious, it wasn't me! Don't play dumb. You baited kids to shoot video of the teacher! I don't know her, never baited anyone. Then why did you run? I don't believe this! Hey, give me that. You know YANG Se-jung? Look, you're Master. We confirmed you were in contact with the kids. Drop the bulls***. Get me a lawyer. I'll smack you, think you know the law? Sir, one moment. - You sure? - 100%! I called it several times, but his phone won't ring. It's gotta be him. - Maybe a burner? - I'm right about this. Sir, we got a call from the station, Master's signal is still tracked at his house. - Screw this... - Let's move! Seo-rin! Master's not here, my boys are after him. This is a crime scene. Let's wait outside. I'm sorry. Did we startle you? We're not bad guys, I'll explain everything. It's okay. ...awarded for proficient online research skills... Soranet Calling Master Your call cannot be connected... It was you? It was all a prank? It looks like he was mimicking the way JO used the students. How long has he been doing this? When KIM Dong-jin's group was arrested a month ago, JO was afraid of getting caught and went dark. His son knew about it, so he pretended to be Master, and got in touch with YANG. A 13-year old doing this for fun? The world has gone insane. What did the expert say? He has lost touch with reality, so it was like a game to him. He won't be prosecuted. Since he's a minor, he'll just get a probation. What'll happen to other kids? They were sent to the prosecutors, who knows if the charges will stick. Korean laws are really screwed up. The parents of the students will ask you to settle this. Be ready for that. Thank you for everything. And also... I thought you'd be curious. Kanghwa Funeral Home It was suicide. He couldn't keep a decent job afterwards. He had run-ins with the law, and ended up like this. What if JO was the one who threatened me? Or as we predicted, what if KIM was Master? When I found out that a kid was controlling me, do you know how I felt? Relief. I was glad it was a prank and not a monster. That it wasn't another KIM Jin-ho, and that it wasn't JO Young-je. So this is goodbye for good. We should never... meet again under same circumstances. It's the first time seeing you smile. I had this for way too long. What's this? I'm off. Thank you. We got a new student today. It won't be easy for her, be good to her. Yes, ma'am! HAN Seo-rin Hello, my name is HAN Seo-rin. I hope we all get along well. How about sitting over there?
