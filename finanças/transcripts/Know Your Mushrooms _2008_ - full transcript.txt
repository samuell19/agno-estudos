>>SPEAKING OF MAGIC, THE WORLD'S PREMIER MUSHROOM FESTIVAL ROLLS INTO TOWN FOR A FUN-GI FILLED WEEKEND. WELCOME MUSHROOM PEOPLE, IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE, PLEASE DO NOT KILL US. PLEASE DO NOT ABDUCT US. >>OH I'M REALLY RIPPING THEM UP HERE IN TELLURIDE, THREE MILES OVER THE LIMIT, HANG ON BABY. AH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, HUH. >>IT'S LARRY! HEY LARRY, GLAD TO SEE YOU, MAN! WELCOME TO THE FESTIVAL! >>IS IT SAFE TO EAT? >>DID YOU FIND A BUNCH OF THESE TOGETHER, DIDN'T YOU. >>YEAH. >>OKAY, THIS SMELLS LIKE A LITTLE BIT LIKE CUCUMBER, AND A LITTLE BIT LIKE BAD FISH. YOU KNOW, SMELL THAT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK, I MEAN... >>YEAH. >>IT HAS A SMELL, YOU KNOW, AND NOTICE THAT SMELL. THIS IS A TOXIC MUSHROOM. >>TOXIC! >>TOXIC, OH. >>THIS IS ONE THAT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO EAT. IF YOU DID, YOU WOULD PASS WATER THROUGH EVERY OPENING ON YOUR BODY. UM, INCLUDING YOUR EARS. PEOPLE SAY 'OH, WELL IS THAT A GOOD WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT?' NO, IT'S A REALLY BAD WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT, ACTUALLY. HA HA. >>WELCOME, ALL OF YOU, TO THE 27TH TELLURIDE MUSHROOM FESTIVAL. WE HAVE SEVERAL TRADITIONS HERE IN TELLURIDE, ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, A GOOD FRIEND OF THE FESTIVAL CHRIS DEAN, PASSED AWAY RECENTLY. CHRIS USED TO ALWAYS OPEN THE FESTIVAL BY RINGING THIS BIG BRASS TIBETAN BOWL. AND A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF HIS IS HERE RIGHT NOW, AND I'D LIKE TO BRING HIM UP, ROBERT BOUILLON, AND HE WILL OFFICIALLY OPEN THE FESTIVAL WITH THE RINGING OF THE BOWL. >>THINK ABOUT THE PLANET THAT YOU KNOW. YOU GOT THESE CONTINENTS, AND NOT SO LONG AGO, WE, WITHIN A HUNDRED YEARS, WHO'S COUNTING, WE BELIEVED THOSE CONTINENTS WERE ALWAYS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN. NO ONE EVER BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD EVER MOVED OR COULD MOVE, AND NOW WE KNOW THAT NOT ONLY DO THEY MOVE, THEY ARE MOVING NOW. AND THAT THOSE CONTINENTS ARE ON LARGER MASSES THAN THE CONTINENTS THEMSELVES. THEY'RE ON THINGS CALLED PLATES, TECTONIC PLATES. AND, WHAT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS THE EARTH WE KNOW, THE TERRESTRIAL PART OF THE EARTH, BEING UNDERLAIN BY A MYCELIAL MAT, A TANGLE OF FUNGAL THREADS UNDER ALL THE TREES AND GRASS AND SHRUBS, AND THIS FUNGAL NETWORK DECOMPOSES ORGANIC MATTER, PROVIDES NUTRIENTS TO THE TREES, AND HELPS SUSTAIN THE PLANET. >>ANYONE MIGHT WELL IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A LANDSCAPE AMONG STEEP CLIFFS AND SHADOWY VALLEYS OF A STRANGE, FARAWAY WORLD. ON WHAT HILLSIDE HAVE WE EVER SEEN SO ODD A GROWTH? YET, THESE ARE SCENES FROM A FAIRYLAND THAT IS ALL ABOUT US. THE LAND OF FUNGUS. THIS IS THE SPROUTING BODY OF A FUNGUS, COMMONLY CALLED A TOADSTOOL. IN THE UNDERSURFACE OF THE CAP THERE ARE TINY SPORES, EACH A SINGLE CELL. THE FUNGAL CELL IS FULL OF LIVING MATTER WHICH EXTENDS THE CELL WALL AND GROWS INTO A TUBE. THE ORIGINAL CELL DEVELOPS INTO A GREAT NETWORK OF TUBES, THE PLANT BODY OF THE FUNGUS. IN TOADSTOOLS AND OTHER FUNGUS THIS GROWTH MAY CONTINUE UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG TIME IN THE MEADOWS, UNDER DAMP FLOORS, UNDER RUBBISH, IN FACT ANY PLACE WHERE THERE IS DARKNESS, MOISTURE AND THE RIGHT KIND OF FOOD. THE SPORE BEARING BODY, OR MUSHROOM, COMES AT LAST INTO THE LIGHT. LIKE DAINTY DANCERS IN A PAGEANT OF FAIRYLAND, THEY SWAY GRACEFULLY BEFORE US FOR A SHORT WHILE AND THEN ARE GONE. >>LOOKS GOOD. >>AND THIS IS HONEY. >>HONEY, I WANT TO TASTE THE HONEY, DID LARRY COOK THIS? >>I'M AFRAID SO! NO EXCUSE! IF YOU ONLY USE BUTTER, ESPECIALLY LIKE WITH MORELS, THEY GET SO, YOU JUST TASTE THE BUTTER. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE WHERE'S THE MUSHROOM, YOU HAD A MUSHROOM IN HERE SOMEWHERE. I'VE BEEN COMING TO TELLURIDE FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS, YOU KNOW, GIVE A LITTLE LECTURE, LEAD A FORAY OR SOMETHING. I LIKE TO DO SOME COOKING TOO. I USED TO HAVE A RESTAURANT, SO I WHIP UP SOME WILD MUSHROOM DISHES THAT ARE JUST KILLER. >>WE NEED SOMEBODY TO SERVE. YO, IT'S CHOW TIME! >>THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY COOL ABOUT FINDING FREE FOOD. YOU KNOW, GOING OUT IN THE WOODS AND IT'S 'HEY, LOOK, YOU CAN EAT THAT!' >>I GREW UP ON A CHRISTMAS TREE FARM. WE WERE, WE HAD A LITTLE MORE REMOTE, YOU KNOW, SO I ENDED UP SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ROAMING AROUND THE WOODS AND HANGING OUT IN THE TREES AND COLLECTING MUSHROOMS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF. WHY ARE MUSHROOMS FASCINATING? I FEEL LIKE I KIND OF JUST TRIPPED OVER A ROCK AND STARTED DIGGING IT OUT AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A WHOLE MOUNTAIN UNDER THERE, YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE ONCE I PICKED A MUSHROOM AND STARTED FOLLOWING IT BACK TO THE TREE ROOTS, AND INTO THE SOIL I SUDDENLY REALIZED IT'S ALL HOOKED UP, IT'S ALL HOOKED UP TO THE SAME BIG ECOSYSTEM. >>BOLIVIA'S JUST AMAZING, I STARTED GOING DOWN THERE IN '97, AND I'VE BEEN BACK EVERY YEAR THE LAST FEW YEARS, CHECKING OUT THE SPECIES IN THE UPPER AMAZON RAINFOREST. >>GOING TO MACHETE OUR WAY THROUGH THIS STUFF. LOOK AT THE COLOUR OF THAT BUTTERFLY. >>IN FOUR DAYS, WE FOUND ALMOST THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT SPECIES OF MUSHROOM. I MEAN, THE DIVERSITY IS JUST INCREDIBLE, AND OUT OF THOSE THERE WERE AT LEAST FIFTY THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THERE'S JUST SO MUCH UNKNOWN IN THE WORLD OF MUSHROOMS. >>LOOK AT THAT. HOLEY MOLEY, WHAT A MONSTER. >>VERY THIN FLESH. VERY WIGGLY, RUBBERY, COMING FROM A TERMITE NEST. >>WELL, I'VE ALWAYS LOVED MORELS. YOU KNOW, I GREW UP PICKING THEM. ARCTIC MORELS ARE INCREDIBLE! BECAUSE THE DAY GOES ALMOST 24 HOURS UP THERE, YOU DON'T HAVE THE SUDDEN DROP IN TEMPERATURE, THEY JUST KEEP GROWING AND GROWING AND GROWING AND GROWING. >>FIRST COUPLE OF PICKLES I'VE SEEN FOR A WHILE. >>EVERY YEAR, I HAUL HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF MORELS DOWN TO THE FARMERS MARKET. PEOPLE LIKE IT. >>NORMAN! NORMAN!! AAAAAH! >>AS CHILDREN WE'RE TOLD TO AVOID WILD MUSHROOMS. IN FACT, I REMEMBER BEING WARNED WHEN I WAS MOWING THE LAWN NOT TO LET THE LAWN MOWER RUN OVER ANY KIND OF TOADSTOOL THAT WAS GROWING BECAUSE IT COULD SOMEHOW WRECK THE MOTOR? >>THOSE OF US IN TELLURIDE ARE FUNGOPHILES, PEOPLE WHO REALLY LOVE MUSHROOMS, AS OPPOSED TO MOST PEOPLE IN NORTH AMERICA WHO ARE REALLY FUNGOPHOBES. THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO FEAR MUSHROOMS, AND PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE BACKGROUND WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE TRADITION OF COLLECTING MUSHROOMS IN OUR FORESTS. WE DON'T HAVE RELATIVES WHO HAVE BEEN COLLECTING MUSHROOMS OVER GENERATIONS AS YOU FIND IN EUROPE AND IN ASIA. AND WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT MUSHROOMS AROUND THE STATES AND SUCH YOU FIND THAT WHAT MUSHROOMS THEY KNOW ABOUT ARE THE FEW THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETS. SOMETIMES THEY CALL THEM PORTOBELLOS OR CREMINIS BUT THEY'RE ALL VARIETIES OF THE COMMON COMMERCIAL BUTTON MUSHROOM. WHICH IS EASY AND CHEAP TO CULTIVATE. >>THESE ARE ALL FROM THE WAREHOUSE. WHAT I HAVE IS YOUR BASIC, A WHITE MUSHROOM, THESE IN THE PACKAGE HERE OR THESE HERE. THESE OVER HERE ARE WHAT THEY CALL CREMINI OR BROWN MUSHROOM. AND OF COURSE OVER HERE WE HAVE THE BIG ONES WHICH ARE THE PORTOBELLOS. I WAS GOING TO GET SOME OF THE MORE ORIENTAL TYPE OF MUSHROOMS IN, BUT YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW THAT GOES. >>WHO LIVES IN HERE? THE MUSHROOMS, DEAR. THEY'RE SLEEPING PEACEFULLY SO THEY CAN GROW, AND GROW AND GROW! JUST GROW DELICIOUSLY! THEN CAMPBELL KIDS WILL PICK THE BEST, AND ASK THE COW FOR CREAM, FOR CAMPBELL'S CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP. >>THE TASTE IS JUST SUPREME! >>IT'S NOURISHING TOO! AND GIVES YOU PROTEINS, VITAMINS AND MINERALS! TO HELP YOU GROW! >>MMM, GOOD! >>THE MUSHROOM INDUSTRY HAS A VESTED INTEREST AGAINST WILD MUSHROOMS. THE REALITY IS THERE ARE ONLY A FEW REALLY DEADLY MUSHROOMS AND NOT MANY MORE THAT ARE POISONOUS, SO IT'S A MATTER OF LEARNING ABOUT THEM. >>WHEN I MOVED TO THE COUNTRY, I REALIZED THAT I WAS STARVED FOR NATURE. I WOULD DAY AFTER DAY, DROP EVERYTHING, AND JUST WALK IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS. JUST PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYTHING IN NATURE AND FORGETTING ONESELF A LITTLE BIT RESULTS IN DAYS THAT PASS VERY QUICKLY. >>IT'S A SPELLING THING, EVERYBODY KNOWS GURU, YOU KNOW, BUT... >>WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE TOO, LOOK AT THAT. >>HA HA HA HA. >>THESE ARE MUSHROOM CAMOUFLAGE, THE MUSHROOMS DON'T RECOGNIZE THESE AS BOOTS, SO THEY DON'T, THEY DON'T HIDE AS WELL, THEY THINK 'WHAT'S THAT'! IT'S A FUZZY CATERPILLAR!' THIS IS MY MUSHROOM KNIFE, IT'S CHEAP, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOOSING IT, AND I CAN TAKE IT ON THE PLANE. THEY GOT A WHOLE CONVOY OF SUV'S! GOT TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER ON THIS CARPOOLING. >>DO YOU WANT TO PUT ANYTHING BACK HERE, LARRY? >>AH, JUST THIS. THIS IS A REALLY GREAT THING, MAN. YOUR FLY TACKLE. >>YEAH. >>YOU KNOW, A FISHING BOX, AND I CAN GET ALL KINDS OF SPECIES IN THERE, YOU KNOW, AND THEY COME BACK AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT THEM ON THE TABLE. YOU PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET OR YOUR BAG AND YOU GET BACK IT'S LIKE 'WELL THIS USED TO BE...' HA HA HA, WE USED TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THIS. >>EVERYONE KNOWS THAT MUSHROOMS LOVE THE RAIN, AND AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THE MONSOON RAINS COME INTO THE MOUNTAINS CREATING THE PERFECT ENVIRONMENT FOR MUSHROOMS, AND WITH THE RAIN HEADING WEST IT LOOKS TO BE A SPECTACULAR WEEKEND FOR PICKING MUSHROOMS. SO THERE YOU HAVE IT MUSHROOM LOVERS, GET OUT THERE AND COMMUNE WITH THE SHROOM. THIS IS LIKE BOLIVIA HERE, YOU'RE GOING AROUND THESE HAIRPIN CURVES, YOU'RE ON THE BUS AND YOU SEE...SKY, AS IT GOES AROUND THE CORNER YOU SEE SKY AND THEN YOU SEE THE SIDE WALL OF THIS, AND YOU SEE SKY AGAIN. YEAH, THE GUY'S GOT TO HAVE COJONES THE SIZE OF GRAPEFRUIT TO DRIVE THOSE BUSES MAN. >>NOT A BAD BACKDROP, LARRY. >>YEAH, NICE HUH? WE'LL BE, WE'LL BE LOOKING OUT HERE, SEE THE EDGE, THE EDGE HERE, WE WANT TO JUST CHECK THE EDGE OF THIS TYPE OF AREA HERE FOR BOLETE, AND THEN WE'LL PROBABLY GO BACK UP AND LOOK FOR LESS WELL DRAINED AREAS FOR CHANTERELLES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. >>AH, THERE WE GO. THAT'S A NICE LOOKING HABITAT THERE. >>WE'RE GOING TO FIND GOOD STUFF ALL OVER. >>THERE'S SOMETHING. I THINK WE HAVE ONE OF THE AMECOSAS HERE. IF THIS IS AGARICUS AMICOSAS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SEE? >>PINK GILLS. >>PINK GILLS, WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG. WE DEFINITELY HAVE PINK GILLS, THEY'RE NOT GREY OR WHITE. OK, SECOND THING IS IT CUTS WHITE, STAINS, AND THEN FADES TO THIS REDDISH ORANGE TYPE COLOUR, THERE YOU SEE THE STAIN THERE AGAIN. AND WHAT SMELL ARE WE LOOKING FOR? >>PHENOLIC AS YOU DESCRIBED IT. >>RIGHT, IF YOU'VE GOT A PHENOLIC OR LIBRARY PASTE SMELL WE WANT TO AVOID THAT, OKAY? BECAUSE OUR TOXIC SPECIES TEND TO HAVE THAT SMELL. WHAT ELSE WE GOT? OH GOOD, YEP, HONEYS. NOW HONEY MUSHROOM, THAT'S A GOOD EATER, EVERYBODY'S BEEN EATING THAT ALL WEEKEND, THEY'RE NICE AND FRESH AND READY TO GO. >>AND I SEE SOMETHING RIGHT UP THERE. >>SO JUST SING OUT IF YOU FIND SOME GOOD STUFF AND WE'LL COME TAKE A LOOK! YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WILL BE SPANKED IF THEY DON'T FIND A CHANTERELLE! >>IT'S A BOLETE. A BIG ONE. THESE THINGS EXCITE ME. >>WHENEVER YOU GOT A BOLETE THAT'S RIPE AND IT'S ALREADY PRODUCING SPORES, THIS SPONGE IS NOT SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO EAT ANYWAY. SO I LIKE TO TAKE THOSE OFF BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY'RE GETTING THEIR SPORES OUT. THAT'S THE FERTILE TISSUE THAT I JUST TOOK OFF. >>AH, I SEE, SO WE'LL JUST LEAVE THAT TO HANG AROUND HERE. >>AND THAT WILL JUST STAY HERE. AND NOW, THIS IS THE OTHER THING WE OFTEN DO WITH BOLETES. I OFTEN DO THIS BEFORE I PUT THEM IN MY BAG. NOW THERE'S ALL THAT DIRT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE RUBBED INTO YOUR MUSHROOM AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN OUT. SO, NOW I HARDLY HAVE TO WASH THAT SUCKER, SEE? FIELD DRESSED. AND HERE'S LAC LAC, LACCARIA LACCATA, THE SWEDISH DID A STUDY OF THESE, AND THEY TOOK THE LITTLE THRIPS, THE SNOW THRIPS? YOU KNOW THE LITTLE SNOW FLEAS THEY CALL THEM? AND THEY PUT THE THRIPS IN WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT PETRI DISHES TO SEE WHICH ONES THEY'D EAT. WELL THEY CAME BACK AND THESE GUYS, THE LAC LACS, HAD EATEN THE THRIPS. THE RESEARCHER SAYS, 'YOU KNOW, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE PUTTING A FOOTBALL PLAYER IN A ROOM WITH A PIZZA AND YOU COME BACK LATER AND THE PIZZA ATE THE FOOTBALL PLAYER, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?' YOU KNOW? >>STILL NO CHANTERELLES, HUH? >>I GOT ONE UP HERE! >>HEY, WE GOT A CHANTERELLE? >>THERE'S A LITTLE ONE. HERE WE GO, THAT'S A LITTLE BIGGER. ALL RIGHT, HOPEFULLY, IF WE STICK THAT BACK, IT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. >>A WHOLE HANDFUL OF THE LITTLE BUGGERS. >>WELL I FOLLOWED YOUR ADVICE, I LOOKED AT THE TERRAIN, I LOOKED AT THE MOSS, I LOOKED FOR THE WHITE. YOU DID IT RIGHT, YEAH. YOU GOT TO ADMIRE YOUR DILIGENCE ON THAT, BUDDY. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT. GOT SOMETHING OVER THERE? >>OH YEAH, THAT'S A PEPPERY BOLETE, IT'S CONSIDERED NON-EDIBLE, BUT HERE WE GO. WANT TO TRY? >>I GUESS SO. >>I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT. WORK IT AROUND IN YOUR MOUTH FOR A SECOND. IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT YOU, IT'S NOT LIKE A RUSSULA. YOU STARTING TO GET THE, GET THE HEAT THERE? UGH. >>NO ONE CAN EVER SAY FOR SURE WHERE TRUFFLES GROW. THE ONLY WAY TO FIND THEM IS TO SMELL THEM OUT. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY THE SMELL THEY LIKE. GIVEN HALF THE CHANCE THEY'D SWALLOW THEM DOWN IN NO TIME. >>THIS KITCHEN, THIS LIVING, THIS DINING ROOM WAS DESIGNED TO ENTERTAIN. AND YOU'LL NOTICE HOW THE WINDOWS ARE HIGHER OVER HERE? IN THIS SECTION OF THE HOUSE? THAT'S SO THE CHEF HAS A VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS. >>IT HAS A REALLY WINEY, SMOKEY, EARTHY BASE NOTE TYPE OF FLAVOUR. WHEREAS THESE SHRIMP ARE GOING TO BE MORE OF A SEAFOOD WHITE WINE TYPE OF FLAVOUR AND THEN THE BOLETES ARE REALLY SWEET AND NUTTY AND THE CHANTERELLES ARE ALMOST FRUITY, SO, WE GOT FOUR PRETTY INTERESTING FLAVOURS HERE. ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? >>SMELL THE FISH! THAT'S THE MUSHROOM I'VE SERVED TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE MUSHROOMS, AND NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THEY LOVE IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A MUSHROOM TASTE OR A MUSHROOM TEXTURE, VERY FIRM TEXTURE. >>POUR IT IN THERE? >>YOU BET! YEAH BABY! THAT'S DELICIOUS. >>HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A BIOLUMINESCENT FUNGI? THOSE ARE, THEY GLOW IN THE DARK? YEAH? THERE'S, WE HAVE A COUPLE UP HERE, ONE OF THEM'S THE JACK 'O LANTERN, BIG CLUMPS OF MUSHROOMS JUST GLOW. I MEAN YOU WALK DOWN THE PATH IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT JACK 'O LANTERNS, PUMPKINS, SET RIGHT OUT THERE. AND WE ALSO SEE THEM DOWN IN BOLIVIA, THE MYCELIA FORM LITTLE TRAILS THAT GLOW AND INSECTS WILL WALK ACROSS, THEY'LL FIND THIS LITTLE GLOWING TRAIL AND THEY'LL FOLLOW IT RIGHT TO WHERE THE MUSHROOM IS, AND THESE MUSHROOMS ARE ALIVE, IT'S LIKE A BUG DISCO. >>TERENCE MCKENNA, YOU KNOW THE PSYCHEDELIC GURU, HE HAD A THEORY THAT THEY WERE AN ALIEN LIFE FORM, THAT THEY CAME FROM OUTER SPACE. ALL TOO EASY TO BELIEVE SOMETIMES. >>YOU KNOW, I, YEARS AGO, USED TO HOLD THE OPINION AND STILL DO IN THE PRIVACY OF MY OWN HEART THAT THIS THING COULD HAVE COME FROM OUTER SPACE. NOT THE MUSHROOM PER SE, BECAUSE WE HAVE A FOSSIL RECORD OF MUSHROOMS AND SO FORTH ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T SO GOOD, IT ONLY GOES BACK ABOUT 40 MILLION YEARS. HOW LONG HAVE MUSHROOMS BEEN AROUND? SINCE THEY'RE PRIMARY DECOMPOSERS, YOU'D ASSUME THEY'D BEEN AROUND SINCE THE GET-GO, BUT THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE ISN'T THERE. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A VERY SOPHISTICATED TRAVELING GENE OF VIRAL SIZE INSERTED ITSELF INTO THIS ORGANISM FOR SOME PURPOSE BEYOND OUR CAN? BECAUSE YOU SEE, TO ME THE MIRACLES OF PSILOCYBIN IS THE HALLUCINATIONS, THE VISION, THE INFORMATION. I'M COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT THIS STUFF CAN'T COME FROM ME, AND I'M A JUNGIAN! >>IT IS ALMOST MIDNIGHT BEFORE THE BRUJO APPEARS. HE HAS PRACTICED THE SECRET AND ALL BUT FORBIDDEN RITES OF THE SACRED MUSHROOM FOR DECADES, RITES PASSED ON FROM FATHER TO SON PERHAPS 4,000 YEARS. TO ACHIEVE SPIRITUAL UNION, OUR SCIENTISTS ALSO MUST EAT THE MUSHROOM. THE STRANGELY AROMATIC ROOT IS BURNED, INHALED. THE BRUJO MURMURS INCANTATIONS IN CHATINA, A LANGUAGE UNKNOWN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THIS EARTH. THE FIRST SOUND WE HEAR AS THE CHEMICAL IN THE MUSHROOM TAKES EFFECT, IS LAUGHTER. >>WHAT IS THAT? >>OH THIS IS MYCELIUM PRESSED WITH SPORES FROM SOME KIND OF MAGIC MUSHROOM. >>I LIKE THEM. NICE. WANT ONE? >>SURE. >>I'D GET ONE WITH A CAP, THAT ONE. YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE. WHOOP! (IMITATES POLICE SIREN) >>IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME HERE? >>THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HERE, YES. >>AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE TELLURIDE MUSHROOM FESTIVAL? >>IT'S GOOD MAN, IT'S GREAT MAN. I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE DRUMS, MAN, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH LUCK. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY MIGRATED TO, MAN, WHERE THEY WENT, MAN. YOU KNOW? >>TERENCE MCKENNA TALKS ABOUT MUSHROOMS AS HAVING BEEN THE CATALYST FOR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND HE HAS THE WHOLE THEORY OF THIS, THAT WHEN WE CAME OUT OF THE TREES WE WENT TO THE DUNG OF THE UNGULATES AND WE TURNED THEM OVER AS MONKEYS AND THEY STILL DO THIS TODAY IN THE SAVANNAHS AND THEY PICK OUT THE MUSHROOMS TO EAT. WELL, SINCE PSYLOCYBES SPECIES IS COPROPHILIC AND LIVES ON DUNG, THEY WOULD PICK OUT PSYLOCYBES. IT TURNS OUT, IN LOW DOSES, PSYLOCYBE INCREASES VISUAL ACUITY, SO IN A HUNTER-GATHERER SOCIETY IF YOU GOT BETTER EYESIGHT, YOU HUNT BETTER, YOU'RE SELECTED FOR ADVANCEMENT. PEOPLE WHO ATE THE MUSHROOMS ADVANCED OVER TIME. IT TURNS OUT YOU EAT MORE OF THOSE MUSHROOMS YOU GET KIND OF HORNY AND IF YOU GET KIND OF HORNY YOU HAVE MORE KIDS AND HERE YOU ARE A BETTER HUNTER, HAVING MORE KIDS. AND THEN IF YOU TAKE MASSIVE DOSES WHICH OF COURSE IS WHAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES, YOU SEE GOD WHICH IS WHY WE CALL IT AN ENTHEOGEN SO HE SAYS HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS DEVELOPED THAT WAY. WELL WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT, I THINK MUSHROOMS HAVE HAD A HUGE IMPORTANT PART TO PLAY IN EVERY CULTURE THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH, AND BECAUSE OF THE PSYCHOTROPIC ASPECT OF IT, MANY CULTURES USE THEM AS THE ALLY, THE SPIRIT ALLY, TO TAKE THEM TO THE OTHER WORLD. >>PSYLOCYBIN MIMICS THE EFFECTS OF SEROTONIN IN THE BRAIN. IT ALSO ENHANCES THE BRAIN'S PERCEPTUAL SYSTEM SO THAT USERS OFTEN REPORT TRAILS AND AURAS AROUND EXISTING SOURCES OF LIGHT, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFECTS HAVE TO DO WITH THE DEEPER IDEAS AND FEELINGS THAT PSILOCYBIN GENERATES IN THE USER. MUSHROOMS HAVE WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGIST WILLIAM JAMES HAS CALLED A "NOETIC" QUALITY. THEY PRODUCE PROFOUND STATES OF KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT. >>THE OUTDOORS, THE SETTING OF CHOICE FOR A MUSHROOM TRIP, IS TRANSFORMED SO THE FOREST FEELS MORE LIKE A LIVING, BREATHING CATHEDRAL. A FORUM FOR THE DEEP APPRECIATION OF NATURE THROUGH WHICH THE WONDROUS MUSHROOM EATER MOVES IN A STATE OF ECOLOGICAL GRACE. >>I WAS IN L.A. FOR A FORAY, AND I WAS WANDERING AROUND IN ONE OF THE CANYONS LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS. TWO PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME AND THEY SAID DO YOU KNOW GARY LINCOFF? AND THEY SAID WELL THEY NEEDED GARY LINCOFF TO HELP THEM TO FIND THE FLY AGARIC, AMANITA MUSCARIA, WHICH THEY KNEW GREW IN THAT CANYON. THEY WERE PREPARING THEMSELVES TO LEAVE THE PLANET. AND THEY SAID THEY THOUGHT THE MUSCARIA, THE FLY AGARIC WOULD SHOW THEM THE WAY. THEY CONTINUED TO TALK, AND I TOLD THEM, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHO I WAS, AND THE ONE GUY SAYS 'LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO COME OVER TO MY PLACE.' AND 'I'VE GOT SOMETHING I REALLY HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU.' SO I HAD THE NIGHT FREE, AND I WENT OVER. SO I WALKED INTO THIS GUY'S HOUSE AND I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THEM, AND HE HAS A REFRIGERATOR FULL OF DRUGS. I MEAN HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY NORMAL FOOD, LIKE NO LOAF OF BREAD, YOU KNOW, NO BUTTER, NOTHING! JUST DRUGS. AND HE HAD A COUPLE EGGS, AND HE HAD GUNS ALL OVER HIS WALL. NOW, I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY AND THAT'S NOT THE SORT OF THING WE HAVE ON OUR WALL. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE HANDGUNS. PLUS, THERE WERE A LOT OF DOGS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BARKING THEIR HEADS OFF AND THEY SOUNDED ANGRY, SO THIS WAS LIKE NOT A GOOD SCENE. BUT, HE SAID 'YOU'RE HERE AND YOU HAVE TO SHARE THIS WITH US.' SO HE MAKES UP THIS THING WITH MAGIC MUSHROOMS, WHICH I HAD NOT HAD, AND I EAT THEM, AND THEN HE SITS ME DOWN ON A SOFA AND HE SAYS 'JUST STARE AT ME' AND HIS ENTIRE LIVING ROOM WITHIN A HALF AN HOUR TURNED FROM A MULTI COLOUR INTO KIND OF A DESERT GREY. AND HE TURNED INTO A WOLF, SITTING THERE, STARING AT ME. HE SAID 'YOU LOOK APPREHENSIVE, IS THERE A PROBLEM?' AND I SAID 'I COULDN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS,' BUT I WAS THINKING THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE, AND THIS IS LIKE ENDING. HE SAID JUST, LIKE, 'LET IT GO' AND NOT BEING PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS TO COME, I EVENTUALLY RELAXED. HE SAID 'DO YOU SEE A LIGHT' AND I SAID 'YES', HE SAYS 'WHAT COLOUR IS IT?' AND I SAID 'WHITE' HE SAID 'WELL ARE YOU GOING TO FOLLOW IT? I SAID 'DO I HAVE A CHOICE?' AND HE SAID WELL, 'THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.' AND THEN THE ROOF OPENS UP OVER MY HEAD AND BEFORE I KNOW IT I'M OUT OF MY BODY AND I'M GOING, I'M NOT FLOATING, I'M ACTUALLY MOVING. SO I FOLLOW THIS THING OUT AND WE ARE GOING OUT INTO OUTER SPACE AND SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE HE SAID MUST HAVE BEEN THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY, I WAS GETTING COLD AND HE SAID 'WELL WHY DON'T YOU STOP BY THE FIRE?' HE SAID 'WELL THERE'S A FIREPLACE OUT THERE'. OKAY, SO I FOUND IT AND I GOT WARM, AND I KEPT TRAVELING AND AFTER I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOURS, HE SAID 'DO YOU WANT TO COME BACK?' AND I WAS THINKING, WELL YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY NICE OUT HERE, WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO BACK? BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA, AND SO I START COMING BACK AND RE-ENTRY WASN'T AS DIFFICULT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, AND THERE WAS L.A. AND THEN THERE WAS THE STREET, AND THERE WAS THIS ONE HOUSE WITH A BIG HOLE IN IT'S ROOF AND I SAID 'THAT MUST BE WHERE I GO!' AND I LOOKED DOWN AND SURE ENOUGH, THERE I WAS SITTING ON THE SOFA, AND IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF GETTING WHATEVER IT WAS OF ME OUT THERE BACK INTO THAT BODY. AND THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY THE WHOLE NIGHT, AND HE WASN'T A SHAMAN, HE WASN'T A HEALER, HE WASN'T SOME KIND OF MYSTIC GUIDE, HE WAS JUST A GUY WHO WAS IN THE MOUNTAINS WHO HAD THIS PREDILECTION FOR USING A REFRIGERATOR FULL OF DRUGS AND HE HAD ONE HE WANTED TO SHARE WITH ME. HOPING, I THINK, TO GET ME TO JOIN THEM TO LEAVE THE PLANET. WHICH I WASN'T READY TO DO BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE THEY HAD A REAL GOOD GAME PLAN. NOW, HEY, THAT MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING THING! COULD YOU GO THROUGH A WORMHOLE WITH THE MUSHROOM? AND FIND YOURSELF ON A PLANET LIKE EARTH? IT SOUNDS LIKE FANTASY, WHATEVER, BUT AS I KEEP TELLING PEOPLE, YESTERDAY'S SCIENCE FICTION IS TODAY'S SCIENCE, AND THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T THINK WERE POSSIBLE, ARE POSSIBLE. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PARTIALLY TECHNOLOGY, BUT LARGELY IMAGINATION. >>ONE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER, THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER. >>ONE SIDE OF WHAT? >>THE MUSHROOM! >>WHICH SIDE WILL MAKE ME GROW LARGER? >>THE LARGE MAKING SIDE OF COURSE. >>I'LL TAKE A LITTLE OF BOTH TO MAKE SURE. >>MR. CATERPILLAR SIR, WHERE ARE YOU? >>YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO THINK ABOUT MUSHROOMS IN A RATIONAL WAY BECAUSE EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THEY SEEM TO EXUDE MYSTERY. YOU LOOK AT A LAWN AND YOU SEE A RING OF MUSHROOMS AND YOU KNOW, WE CALL THAT A 'FAIRY RING.' WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? WELL, THE IDEA AT NIGHT, MIDNIGHT, THERE ARE FAIRIES DANCING IN CIRCLES, AND IN THE DAYTIME WHEN WE CAN'T SEE THEM, THERE'S A RING OF MUSHROOMS WHICH WE CALL THE FAIRY RING. THIS LEADS TO A WHOLE MYTHOLOGY ABOUT MUSHROOMS AND FAIRIES AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE, AND THIS IS ALMOST LIKE AN ALTERNATE WORLD LIVING RIGHT ALONG WITH US. >>THOSE OF US WHO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH MUSHROOMS WORRY ABOUT IS, WE END UP WITH A KIND OF A MYCOCENTRIC VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE, EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPLAINED BY MUSHROOMS, OR WITH MUSHROOMS, SO IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT SANTA CLAUS AND NOT SEE THIS GUY THAT LOOKS LIKE A FLY AGARIC WITH THESE REINDEER RIDING ACROSS THE SKY. SURELY THAT MUST HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE USE OF FLY AGARIC MUSHROOMS AND REINDEER IN THE ARCTIC, AND IT MAKES SENSE, AND THEN WE FIND OTHER THINGS AND WE SAY, GEE, IT ALL FITS TOGETHER. AND IT CAN ALL BE, THE WHOLE WORLD CAN BE EXPLAINED BY MUSHROOMS, AND ALL MAJOR RELIGIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE USE OF MUSHROOMS. >>I'M PUZZLED, ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS A MUSHROOM? >>AH, PUT PRETTY BLANKLY, YES. >>SURELY YOU DON'T SUGGEST THAT JESUS CHRIST AND HIS VARIOUS DISCIPLES WERE NOT HUMAN CREATURES? >>YES, YOU ARE DEALING WITH A SECRET CULT, A SECRET SOCIETY. THE STORIES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CONTAIN CERTAIN INCANTATIONS, CERTAIN MAGIC NAMES WHICH WERE REALLY THE NAMES OF THE MUSHROOM. >>NO, BUT THE WRITERS! THE WRITERS! MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, JOHN, THESE MEN WHO WROTE THE STORY, YOU ARE TELLING ME THEY DID NOT EXIST? >>NO. >>NONE OF THEM EXISTED? >>NO, IT'S PART OF MYTHOLOGY, IT'S PART OF MUSHROOM MYTHOLOGY. >>SOME OF THE MUSHROOMS WE CAME ACROSS IN BOLIVIA WERE LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF SCIENCE FICTION. >>DO YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT CORDYCEPS? CORDYCEPS ARE MUSHROOMS THAT EAT INSECTS. THE INSECTS WANDER AROUND AND INGEST THE CORDYCEPS AND THE FUNGUS JUST GRADUALLY GROWS RIGHT THROUGH THE INSECT ATTACKING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WHEN IT IS ATTACKING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS WHEN IT CONTROLS THE ANIMAL'S MOVEMENTS AND KIND OF DIRECTS IT TO MOVE INTO A LOCATION THAT IS MORE FAVORABLE FOR THE MUSHROOM TO FRUIT. THIS INFECTED ANT CLIMBS UP HIGHER AND HIGHER, AND HERE THE MUSHROOM GROWS RIGHT OUT OF THE BACK OF ITS HEAD. SURE GLAD THERE'S NO CORDYCEPS FOR PEOPLE, HUH? >>SEVEN YOUNG PEOPLE SHIPWRECKED ON A MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, WHAT DID THEY FIND? >>FOOD WAS SCARCE, AND THEY WERE FORBIDDEN TO EAT THE MUSHROOMS THAT GREW ON THE ISLAND. >>PLEASE, CAN'T WE EAT THE MUSHROOMS NOW? >>THAT WOULD REALLY BE THE END OF US. >>CAN THEY ESCAPE THE HORRIBLE MUSHROOMS? >>WHEREVER I GO, THERE ARE MUSHROOMS TO HUNT. >>OKAY MUSHROOMS. >>HASTA LA VISTA, BABY. >>THE SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS WE EAT HAVE GREAT CAPABILITIES. THEY HELP LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH. TWO MICE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE: THE MOUSE ON THE LEFT RECEIVED WATER WITH SHIITAKE, THE ONE ON THE RIGHT, PLAIN WATER FOR TWO WEEKS. THEY TOOK THE BLOOD PRESSURE OF BOTH MICE. THE MOUSE GETTING PLAIN WATER, 262. THE MOUSE GETTING WATER WITH SHIITAKE, 160. THAT'S ABOUT 100 POINTS LOWER. SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS ARE GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. >>I'M GOING TO PUT SOME MUSHROOMS IN THE SALAD FOR DINNER TONIGHT? >>WILD MUSHROOMS? YOU SHOULD COOK THE MUSHROOMS. >>WHAT ABOUT THE ONES WE BUY AT THE STORE, JUST SLICE THEM UP RAW? >>YOU SHOULDN'T BUY ANYTHING IN THE STORE. A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT'S IN THE STORE HAS BEEN SO HEAVILY SPRAYED THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH CONTAMINANTS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MUSHROOMS, AND THE COMMERCIAL MUSHROOM PRODUCES TWO, THE GUY THAT DID THE WORK, IT'S BEEN PUBLISHED, STARTED DOING ORAL FEEDINGS WITH LAB ANIMALS AND PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT TUMORS FROM EATING AGARICUS BISPORIS. >>I'VE GOT TO CHECK THAT OUT. >>I'LL HAVE THE KUNG POW BEAN CURD. >>KUNG POW BEAN CURD. >>AND DO YOU HAVE MU-HER? THE BLACK MUSHROOM. IT'S VERY WIGGLY, LIKE AN EAR? >>YEAH. >>YOU HAVE THAT? YOU HAVE THAT IN THE SOUP? >>JUST IN THE HOT AND SOUR SOUP. >>HOT AND SOUR SOUP THEN, YEAH, WE'LL GO FOR THE MU-HER. >>I'LL TRY THAT SWEET AND SOUR COMBINATION. THERE IT IS, IS THAT ON THE MENU? >>THIS IS A CURTISINE, IF YOU'RE SICK, THIS STUFF IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD. ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GIGS IS TO GIVE THIS TO SOMEBODY WHO'S AT THE FARMERS MARKET COMING BY GOING, I SAY 'NASAL PROBLEM? CHEW THIS.' THEY KEEP WALKING DOWN THE MARKET AND BEFORE THEY'VE GONE TWENTY FEET THEY'RE TURNED AROUND GOING 'HOW MUCH? HOW MUCH? WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR IT?' YOU KNOW. NOW THIS ONE HERE, THIS ONE HAS AN INTERESTING HISTORY. THIS, I FOUND THIS ONE IN A CLEAR-CUT THAT HAD BEEN DONE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, A RANCH, BACK IN THE '50'S, OR THE '40'S, THEY'D CUT THESE TREES. AND HERE WAS THIS, COMING UP, YOU KNOW, EIGHT, TEN FEET AWAY FROM A BIG STUMP. WELL THERE'S A FUNGAL TREATMENT RIGHT THERE. AND THEN THE OTHER, THIS ONE, THIS LING CHI IS CULTIVATED, AND AGAIN, IT'S GOT THIS STAG HORN, THEY CALL THIS A STAG HORN, AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S GROWN IN LOW CARBON DIOXIDE ENVIRONMENT SO AS LONG AS THE MUSHROOM DOESN'T GET OXYGEN IT TENDS TO KEEP GETTING LONGER AND LONGER AND LONGER. LING CHI'S ARE REPEATEDLY CITED IN THE LITERATURE AGAINST THINGS LIKE LUPUS, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, TYPES OF ECZEMA AND PSORIASIS, DIABETES, ANYTHING THAT SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO AN AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE, THIS DOES SEEM TO GIVE YOUR BODY A BETTER ABILITY TO TELL SELF FROM NON-SELF, AND THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING IN IMMUNE RESPONSE. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO, IF YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK SOMETHING LET'S NOT HAVE IT PART OF THE BODY, THAT COULD BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. LET'S EAT! >>I THINK THIS WOULD MAKE A GOOD TIP. SOME LING CHI FOR LATER. >>OKAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>A RECENT STUDY THAT I READ SAID THERE ARE 485 SPECIES OF MUSHROOM THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY TRADED AS MEDECINE. BUT IT'S NOT IN AMERICAN AWARENESS RIGHT NOW. >>THE NOKI PRODUCTION IN JAPAN MOSTLY TAKES PLACE IN THE PREFECTURE OF NAGANO, WHICH IS A MOUNTAINOUS REGION IN CENTRAL JAPAN. AND A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ALL THE NOKIS IN JAPAN ARE GROWN WITHIN A FORTY MILE RADIUS OF THE CITY OF NAGANO, AND WITHIN THAT CIRCLE THERE IS A STATISTICALLY LOWER INCIDENCE OF CANCER OF ALL KIND THAN THE REST OF THE JAPANESE POPULATION AND SCIENTISTS AT THE JAPANESE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE ATTRIBUTE THAT TO HIGH CONSUMPTION OF THE NOKI MUSHROOMS BY GROWERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO HERE'S A MUSHROOM THAT YOU CAN GET, IT'S IN SUPERMARKETS, IT'S CHEAP, YOU KNOW ITS TASTE IS UNINTERESTING BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET THEM DOWN FAIRLY EASILY, AND IT'S ONE THAT I COMMONLY RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE CANCER OR HAVE HIGH RISKS OF CANCER. IT CAN'T HURT AND THERE IS GOOD RESEARCH SUGGESTING THAT IS AN ORALLY ACTIVE TUMOR-INHIBITING COMPOUND. >>TOMMY AND HIS BROTHER DAVE, HAVE FOUND AN OLD DEAD TREE IN THE WOODS NEAR THEIR HOME. TOMMY HAS FOUND SOMETHING THAT PUZZLES HIM. THIS HARD, SMOOTH PLANT IS CALLED A FUNGUS. IT GROWS ON THE OLD TREE JUST AS OTHER PLANTS GROW IN SOIL. FUNGUS PLANTS LIKE THESE, AND OTHERS TOO SMALL TO SEE, HELP BREAK DOWN THE WOOD OF THE OLD TREE. THIS IS A PART OF WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY THAT THE OLD TREE DECAYS. THE DECAYED MATERIAL WILL SOMEDAY BECOME A PART OF THE SOIL, WHERE IT WILL FURNISH FOOD FOR OTHER PLANTS TO GROW. NOW TOMMY AND DAVE HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETHING IN THE HOLLOW END OF THE OLD TREE. >>THESE MUSHROOMS ARE DOING THINGS OUT THERE AND MOSTLY WHAT WE KNOW THEY'RE DOING IS WHAT WE LEARNED IN HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE DECOMPOSERS. AND ONE OF THE NEW THINGS THAT'S GOING ON NOW IS HOW PEOPLE CAN, AS THEY SAY, PROACTIVELY USE MUSHROOMS TO BENEFIT OURSELVES. AND SO WE'VE DEVELOPED SOMETHING NOW THAT WE CALL MYCOREMEDIATION AND WE'VE BEEN USING DIFFERENT MUSHROOMS EXPERIMENTALLY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE AN OIL SPILL AND YOU WANT TO CLEAN IT UP, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL HAS BEEN THE USE OF OYSTER MUSHROOMS. THE SAME OYSTER MUSHROOMS THAT YOU FIND IN THE WOODS, IN PARKS, THE SAME OYSTER MUSHROOMS THAT YOU EAT. THESE OYSTER MUSHROOMS CAN BE GROWN OUT, THAT IS SO THE MYCELIUM, THE LITTLE MICROSCOPIC THREADS, ARE IN A KIND OF A MAT, WHICH YOU CAN PUT IN THIS OIL SPILL. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS, AND THIS HAS BEEN TESTED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TIMES IN DIFFERENT PLACES, THE OYSTER MUSHROOM CONSUMES THE OIL. >>OIL EATING MUSHROOMS, IT MAY SOUND LIKE SCIENCE FICTION, BUT THEY'RE REAL. THESE ARE PICTURES OF OYSTER MUSHROOMS WHICH CAN BE USED TO BREAK DOWN OIL THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED ON MATS. AND THAT'S WHAT VOLUNTEERS AND SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS WOULD LIKE TO USE TO HELP GET RID OF SOME OF THE OIL THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED ON BEACHES DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS. >>IT'S GOING TO MAKE A COMPOST HEAP AND WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE WEEKS IT WILL BE DETOXIFIED AND IT WILL BE NON-TOXIC, LANDSCAPE GRADE COMPOST. I THINK SAN FRANCISCO'S GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE OIL SPILL CLEANUP. >>TWO THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THEY DO THIS: ONE IS THAT YOU GET REALLY BEAUTIFUL CLUSTERS OF OYSTER MUSHROOMS COMING UP OUT OF THIS OIL SLICK, AND YOU'D THINK, WELL, YOU'D NEVER WANT TO EAT THOSE, BUT THEY'VE BEEN TESTED AND FOUND TO BE PERFECTLY HARMLESS. THAT IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE PETROLEUM IN THEIR CELLS. THEY ARE CLEAN, AS IT WERE. THE OTHER IS, AND THE MORE IMPORTANT ONE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, IS THAT THE AREA IS CLEAN. THERE IS NO RESIDUE THERE, NO REMNANT OF THE OIL SPILL. AND THIS OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITIES FOR, NOT JUST OIL SPILLS BUT WHAT ABOUT AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN POLLUTED FROM DUMP SITES OF VARIOUS KINDS. ANY OF YOU WHO USE WHITE PAPER TO TAKE NOTES ON THIS LITTLE TALK, KNOW THAT YOU'RE USING PAPER THAT IS, ACID HAS BEEN USED TO TURN THAT WOOD PULP WHITE. AND WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN USE FUNGI MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY AND WITHOUT THE ACID RUNOFF, THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE NOTE AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE PAPER SAYING 'THIS PAPER WAS PRODUCED USING FUNGI.' MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE. >>THE HIGH POINT OF THE TELLURIDE MUSHROOM FESTIVAL IS ALWAYS OUR PARADE DOWN COLORADO AVENUE, TELLURIDE'S MAIN STREET. AND LIKE MUSHROOMS WE LOVE THE RAIN, SO YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HOPE IT RAINS ON OUR PARADE! >>MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN DRESS LIKE MUSHROOMS AND FAIRIES. IT'S WONDERFUL. >>SECOND YEAR FOR THE COSTUME, SEVENTH YEAR FOR THE PARADE, FESTIVAL, WHATEVER. >>LARRY, WHO DID YOU DRESS UP AS TODAY? >>I'M GOING TO GO INCOGNITO. >>LARRY! COME ON, GET YOUR ASS UP, WE'VE GOT TO GO! >>ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. >>I GOT YOU SOME COFFEE. >>OH ALL RIGHT. YUM. >>HOW'D YOU SLEEP? >>OH THE MUSHROOMS KEPT ME UP. >>YEAH, WELL, NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT! >>PESKY MUSHROOMS. >>I'VE BEEN A MUSHROOM GYPSY FOR YEARS NOW. I GO FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS, 'CHASING THE RAIN' AS TAYLOR WOULD SAY, FOLLOWING THE PRECIPITATION EVENTS FROM ALASKA AND MOVING DOWN THE COAST THROUGH OREGON AND WASHINGTON, AND THEN AFTER WINTER, JANUARY ROLLS AROUND, IT'S TIME TO GO SOUTH OF THE BORDER. DIP DOWN IN MEXICO, ECUADOR, COSTA RICA, WHEREVER THE MUSHROOMS ARE. AND IT'S GREAT! IT'S A GREAT LIFE! >>THE MUSHROOM FESTIVAL ENDED THIS PAST WEEKEND, ACCORDING TO ORGANIZERS, A RECORD NUMBER OF MUSHROOMS ATTENDED THIS YEAR'S FESTIVAL. WEEKEND UPDATE: COMING UP LABOR DAY, OUR ANNUAL FILM BUFF BUFFET, THE TELLURIDE FILM FESTIVAL. OPENING NIGHT'S FILM IS THE WORLD PREMIER OF KNOW YOUR MUSHROOMS. YOU MUSHROOM PEOPLE WON'T WANT TO MISS THAT! >>PUFFBALLS ARE UNUSUAL MUSHROOMS, LACKING GILLS OR ANY OTHER SPORE PRODUCING STRUCTURES, THEY PRODUCE THEIR SPORES INTERNALLY THEN RELEASE THEM IN ASTRONOMICAL NUMBERS. CARRIED BY THE WIND, CLUSTERS OF PUFFBALLS ARE KNOWN TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES. WITH SPORES EXPLODING IN EVERY DIRECTION EACH TIME THE PUFFBALL HITS THE GROUND. >>ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IRKS ME MOST ABOUT BIOLOGY, IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY COLLEGE BIOLOGY TEXTBOOK, IT'S ABOUT 1,200 PAGES, ON AVERAGE. THE AMOUNT OF ROOM GIVEN TO FUNGI, OR MUSHROOMS IS TWENTY PAGES. TWENTY PAGES OUT OF TWELVE HUNDRED, HOW COULD THAT BE? I MEAN, WHO'S IN CHARGE? AND WHY AREN'T THEY UP TO DATE WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PLANTS AND MUSHROOMS? WHY CAN'T THEY GET IT TOGETHER AND REALIZE IT'S NOT JUST A TWENTY PAGE ADDITIONAL SECTION THAT COULD JUST AS EASILY BE EXCLUDED, BUT IT'S A TERRIBLY IMPORTANT PART AND THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE WE'RE FAILING THE NEXT GENERATION IF WE DON'T GIVE THEM THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. AND TELLURIDE, THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE HERE, IS TO PROMOTE THIS.
