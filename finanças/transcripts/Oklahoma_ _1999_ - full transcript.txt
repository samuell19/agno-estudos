♫ There's a bright golden haze on the meadow ♫ ♫ The corn is as high as an elephant's eye ♫ ♫ And it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful morning Oh, what a beautiful day ♫ ♫ I've got a beautiful feeling ♫ ♫ Everything's going my way ♫ ♫ All the cattle are standing like statues ♫ Hey! ♫ All the cattle are standing like statues ♫ ♫ They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by ♫ ♫ But a little brown maverick is winking her eye ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful morning ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful day ♫ ♫ I've got a beautiful feeling ♫ ♫ Everything's going my way ♫ Aunt Eller. Ah! Scared me to death. What you doin' around here? Well, I come asingin' to ya. ♫ All the sounds of the earth are like music ♫ ♫ The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree ♫ ♫ And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful morning ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful day ♫ ♫ I've got a beautiful feeling ♫ ♫ Everything's going my way ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful day ♫ If I wasn't an old woman and you wasn't so young and smart alecky, I'd marry you. Get you to sit around at night and sing to me. No you wouldn't either, 'cause I wouldn't marry you, nor none of your kinfolks if I could help it. No, none of my kinfolks, huh? You tell them that, all of them, including that niece of yours, Miss Laurey Williams. Aunt Eller, if you want to tell me where Laurey was at, where would you tell me she was at? I wouldn't tell ya. Not at all. As far as I can make out, Laurey ain't payin' you no heed. So she don't take to me much, huh? Where'd you get such an uppety niece that wouldn't pay no heed to me? Who's the best bronc buster in this here territory? Why, you, I bet. And the best bulldogger in 1 7 counties. Me. That's who. Lookey here. I'm handsome, ain't I? Purdy as a picture. Curly-headed, ain't I? And bow-legged from the saddle for God knows how long, ain't I? Couldn't stop a pig in the road. What else does she want then, the damn she-mule? Well, I don't know, but I'm sure certain it ain't you. So, who are you taking to the Box Social tonight? Oh, I ain't thought much about it. Oh, I bet you come over to ask Laurey. What if I did? You asking me, too? I'll wear my fascinator. You too? Yeah. ♫ Oh, what a beautiful morning ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful day ♫ Oh. I thought you were somebody. ♫ I got a beautiful feelin' ♫ ♫ Everything's going my way ♫ Is this all that's come a-calling at already 10:00 on a Saturday morning? You knowed it was me before you opened the door. No such a thing. You did. You heard my voice. You know it was me. I heard a voice talking rumbly along at Aunt Eller. I heard someone singing like a bullfrog in a pond. You knew it was me, you sittin' there thinkin' up somethin' mean to say. I've a good mind not to ask you to the Box Social. Well, if you did ask me, I wouldn't go with you. Besides, how would you take me? You ain't bought a new buggy with red wheels onto it, have you? No, I ain't. And a spanking team their bridles all a-jingling. No. Expect me to ride on behind ole Dun, I guess. Better ask that old Cummings girl you took such a shine to across the river. Well, if I was to ask you, there'd be a way to take you, Miss Laurey Smarty. Huh? There would? ♫ When I take you out tonight with me ♫ ♫ Honey, here's the way it's gonna be ♫ ♫ You will sit behind a team ♫ ♫ of snow white horses ♫ ♫ In the slickest gig you ever see ♫ Lands! ♫ Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry ♫ ♫ When I take you out in the surrey ♫ ♫ When I take you out in the surrey ♫ ♫ with the fringe on top ♫ ♫ Watch that fringe and see how it flutters ♫ ♫ When I drive them high steppin' strutters ♫ ♫ Nosey pokes will peek through their shutters ♫ ♫ and their eyes will pop ♫ ♫ The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown ♫ ♫ The dashboard's genuine leather ♫ ♫ With isinglass curtains you can roll right down ♫ ♫ in case there's a change in the weather ♫ ♫ Two bright sidelights winkin' and blinkin' ♫ ♫ Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin' ♫ ♫ You can keep your rig if you're thinkin' ♫ ♫ that I'd care to swap ♫ ♫ for that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top ♫ ♫ Would you say the fringe was made of silk? ♫ ♫ Oh, wouldn't have no other kind but silk ♫ ♫ Has it really got a team of snow white horses? ♫ ♫ One's like snow, the other's more like milk ♫ So you can tell them apart. ♫ All the world will fly in a flurry ♫ ♫ When I take you out in the surrey ♫ ♫ with the fringe on top ♫ ♫ When we hit that road, hell for leather ♫ Hya! ♫ Cats and dogs will dance in the heather ♫ ♫ Birds and frogs will sing all together ♫ ♫ and the toads will hop ♫ Wa-haw! ♫ The wind will whistle as we rattle along ♫ ♫ Cows will moo in the clover ♫ ♫ The river will ripple out a whispered song ♫ ♫ And whisper it over and over ♫ ♫ Don't you wish you'd go on forever? ♫ ♫ And you'd never stop ♫ ♫ In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top ♫ You'd sure feel like a queen sitting up in that carriage. Only she talked so mean to me a while back, Aunt Eller, I've a good mind not to take her. Ain't said I was going. Ain't asked ya. Where'd you get such a rig at? I'll bet he went and hired a rig at Claremore thinking I'd go with him. That's all you know about it. Oh, oh, oh, spent all his money hiring a rig and now he ain't got nobody to ride in it. I have, too. Look, I did not hire it. I made the whole thing up out of my head. What? Made it up? Dashboard and all. Oh, get off of the place, you. Aunt Eller, make him get himself out of here. Telling me lies. Makin' up a few... whoo! Making up a few little pretties... hey! Look out, now. Making up a few pretties ain't against any law I know of. Hey, don't you wish there was such a rig though? Hmm? Then you can go to that play party and do a little hoedown till morning if you was a-mind to. And then... when you was all wore out, I'd lift you up onto that surrey, jump up alongside of you and... we'd just point the horses home. ♫ I can see the stars gettin' blurry ♫ ♫ When we arrive back home in the surrey ♫ ♫ Riding slowly home in the surrey ♫ ♫ with a fringe on top ♫ ♫ I can feel the day getting older ♫ ♫ Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder ♫ ♫ Nodding, drooping, close to my shoulder ♫ ♫ till it falls, kerplop ♫ ♫ The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill ♫ ♫ The moon is taking a header ♫ ♫ And just as I'm thinking the earth is still ♫ ♫ A lark will wake up in the meadow ♫ Hush, hush, you bird. ♫ My baby's a-sleepin' ♫ ♫ Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin' ♫ Whoa, you team. ♫ And just keep a-creepin'□ ♫ ♫ at a slow clip clop ♫ ♫ Don't you hurry with the surrey ♫ ♫ with a fringe on the top ♫ Only... Only, there ain't no such rig. What you just said, you made the whole thing up. Why'd you come 'round here, these stories and lies getting me all worked up that way? Talking about the sun swimming on the hill like it was so. Laurey... Who'd want to ride alongside you anyway? Oh, why don't you just grab her and kiss her when she acts that way, Curly? She's just aching for you, too, I bet. I wouldn't even speak to him let alone allow him to kiss me, the bragging, bowlegged, wish-he'd-had-a-sweetheart bum. She likes you. Quite a lot. Yeah, if she liked me anymore, she'd sic the dogs out on me. Listen, Aunt Eller, I got to know something. Who's the low filthy sneak Laurey's got her cap set for? Oh, that's you. No, never mind that. There must be plenty of men trying to spark her and she surely leans to one of them, now, don't she? Well, now, there's that fine farmer, Jace Hutchens. Just this side of Lone Ellum. And then of course there's that old widower man over at Claremore. Makes out he's a doctor or a veterinary. That's what I thought. Hello. Hello yourself. And... And of course there's someone much nearer her home, got her on his mind most of the time, so he can't tell a plow from a threshing machine. Yup. Yup. Jud Fry. That bullet-colored growly man? Now, don't you say nothin' against him. He's the best hired hand I ever had. Just about runs this farm by his self. Well, two women couldn't do it, you ought know that. Laurey would take up with a man like that? I never said she took up. I know, but he's around all the time. And he lives here. In the smokehouse. Hi, Eller. Mornin', Ike. We're going over to the station. You need anything in Claremore? You can take me with you. There's somethin' on that train I gotta pick up. Personal. Hey, Curly. Oh, hey, Slim. Did you get it? Did I get what? Did you get that wagon hitched? Wagon? What wagon? There's a crowd of folks coming from Bushyhead... to the Box Social. Curly said maybe you'd loan us your big wagon. Take 'em over to Mr. Skidmore's ranch. Well, sure I would. If he'd asked me. Yeah, I just got talking about a lot of other things but I'll go hitch up the horses now if you say it's all right. Go ahead. Time we got goin'. Now, why don't you ask the girls from Bushyhead to stop by here and freshen up? All right. It's a long way to Mr. Skidmore's. Thanks for the loan of the wagon, Aunt Eller. Aunt Eller. Hey, hi, Will. Hi, Aunt Eller! What happened at the fair? How'd you do with the steer ropin'? Oh, I did purdy good. I won it. Good boy. Thank you, Ike. I hoped you would. What? What happened? Oh, I can't stay but a minute, Aunt Eller. I gotta get over to Ado Annie. Don't you remember, Pa said if I was ever worth $50, I could have it. $50? Is that what they gave ya for prize money? That's right. Well, if Ado Annie's pa keeps his promise, we'll be dancin' at your wedding. Well, if he don't keep his promise, I'll take it from right under his nose. I won't give him the present I brought for him. Lookey here, fellas, what I got for Ado Annie's pa. Watcha got there? Oh, excuse us, Aunt Eller. Huh? Oh, come on, darling. You put it up to your eye like this, then when you get a good look, you turn it at the top and the picture changes. Well, I'll be side-gaited! They call it the Little Wonder. Silly goats. Why, the hussy! Why, she ought to be ashamed of herself. You too. How do you turn this thing to get her out of the picture? Wait, wait, wait. I'm gettin' it. I'm gettin' it. Did you tell her? No tellin' what you've been up to. I bet you carried on plenty in Kansas City. Well, I wouldn't exactly call it carrying on. But I sure did see some things I'd never seen before. ♫ I got to Kansas City on a Friday ♫ ♫ By Saturday I learned a thing or two ♫ ♫ 'Cause up till then I didn't have an idea ♫ ♫ of what the modern world was coming to ♫ ♫ I counted 20 gas buggies going by themselves ♫ ♫ almost every time I took a walk ♫ ♫ Then I put my ear to a Bell telephone ♫ ♫ and a strange woman started into talk ♫ What next? Yeah, what? What next? ♫ Everything's up to date in Kansas City ♫ ♫ They've gone about as far as they can go ♫ ♫ They went and built a skyscraper ♫ ♫ seven stories high ♫ ♫ About as high as a building oughta grow ♫ ♫ Everything's like a dream in Kansas City ♫ ♫ It's better than a magic lantern show ♫ ♫ You can turn the radiator on ♫ ♫ whenever you want some heat ♫ ♫ With every kind of comfort, every house is all complete ♫ ♫ You can walk to privies in the rain ♫ ♫ and never wet your feet ♫ ♫ They've gone about as far as they can go ♫ Yes sir! ♫ They've gone about as far as they can go ♫ Come here. ♫ Everything's up to date in Kansas City ♫ ♫ They've gone about as far as they can go ♫ ♫ They got a big theater they call a burleekew ♫ ♫ For 50 cents you can see a dandy show ♫ Girls! ♫ One of the girls was fat and pink and pretty ♫ ♫ As round above as she was round below ♫ ♫ I could swear that she was padded ♫ ♫ from her shoulder to her heel ♫ ♫ but later in the second act she began to peel ♫ ♫ She proved that everything she had was absolutely real ♫ ♫ She ran about as far as she could go ♫ Yes sir! ♫ Ran about as far as she could go ♫ Watcha doin'? Hey! Two-step. It's all the dancing nowadays. The waltz is through. Catch on to it. One and a two. One and a two. 'Course they don't do it alone. Come on, Eller. ♫ And that's about as far as I can go ♫ Yes sir! ♫ That's about as far as she can go ♫ Watcha doin' now, Will? Ragtime. Seen a couple of fellas doing it in the street. Whoa. Come on, fellas. Pick this one up. Watch out, Will. Come on, now. I've got ya. All right, fellas. Here we go. (Aunt Eller) Oh, look at that. Hey. Nobody can swing a rope like that. Good boy. Oh, look at that. Come on, Will. Will, you do it. You don't...... Yeehaw! Come on, Will. Come on, Cord. Come on over. That's not funny. Cut it out, Will. I said, cut that out, Will. No, I'm tellin' ya. Stop that. No. Hold on now. Watch my feet. Look at that. Oh, that's mighty genius, what that is. Look at that. He must be in Kansas City trouble, Aunt Eller. Ain't she got a great smile? Thank you, ma'am. Hey, what's going on? Come on back. Woo hoo! Come on now. Up. Up. Watch my feet now. Pick it up now. Let's go. ♫ All about as far as we can go ♫ Thank you. May I? ♫ We've gone as far as we can go ♫ Yoo hoo! Ado Annie. Hello, Laurey! Hello. My, oh my, Miss Laurey. Chippety crickets. How high you have growed up. Last time I come to here, you was tiny. Like a shrimp with freckles. Now look on you. Woo! A great big beautiful lady. Quit bitin' me. If you had no breakfast, go get yourself a green apple. Yeah, all right, I take my things up to the house. No, no, no. I see you in a minute, baby, eh? Hey, Will Parker's back from Kansas City. Will Parker? I didn't count on him being back so soon. I can see that. The peddler man's gonna drive me to the Box Social. I got sort of a tasty lunch. Oh, Annie, have you took up with that peddler man? Not yet. But you're promised to Will Parker, ain't ya? Well, not what you might say promised. I just told him maybe. Don't you love Will anymore? Of course I do. There won't never be nobody like Will. What about this peddler man? They won't never be nobody like him neither. Well, which one do you like the best? Whatever one I'm with. You're a silly cow. Now, Laurey, you know that nobody paid me no mind up until this year on account of I was scrawny and flat as a bean pole. Then I kinda rounded up a little and now the boys act different to me. What's wrong with that? Well, nothing wrong. I like it. I like it so much when a fella talks purdy to me that I get all shaky from horn to hoof. Don't you? Can't think what you're talkin' about. Don't you feel kind of sorry for a fella when he looks like he wants to kiss ya? You just can't go around kissing every man that asks ya. Didn't anyone ever tell you that? Yeah. They told me. ♫ It ain't so much a question ♫ ♫ of not knowing what to do ♫ ♫ I know what's right and wrong ♫ ♫ since I've been 1 0 ♫ ♫ I heard a lot of stories and I reckon they are true ♫ ♫ about how girls are put upon by men ♫ ♫ I know I mustn't fall into the pit ♫ ♫ but when I'm with a fella I forget ♫ Oh. ♫ I'm just the girl who can't say no ♫ ♫ I'm in a terrible fix ♫ ♫ I always say, come on, let's go ♫ ♫ just when I oughta say nix ♫ ♫ When a person tries to kiss a girl ♫ ♫ I know she ought to give his face a smack ♫ ♫ But as soon as someone kisses me ♫ ♫ I somehow sort of wanna kiss him back ♫ ♫ I'm just a fool when lights are low ♫ ♫ I can't be prissy and quaint ♫ ♫ I ain't the type that can faint ♫ ♫ How can I be what I ain't? ♫ ♫ I can't say no ♫ ♫ Watcha gonna do when a fella gets flirty ♫ ♫ and starts to talk purdy? ♫ ♫ Watcha gonna do, supposin' that he says ♫ ♫ that your lips are like cherries? ♫ ♫ Or roses, or berries ♫ ♫ Watcha gonna do? ♫ ♫ Supposin' that he says that you're sweeter ♫ ♫ than cream and he's gotta have cream or die ♫ ♫ Watcha gonna do when he talks that way? ♫ Spit in his eye? No. ♫ I'm just the girl who can't say no ♫ ♫ Can't seem to say it at all ♫ ♫ I hate to disappoint a beau ♫ ♫ when he is payin' a call ♫ ♫ For a while I act refined and cool ♫ ♫ while sittin' on my velveteen settee ♫ ♫ And then I'll think of that old golden rule ♫ ♫ and do for him what he would do for me ♫ ♫ I can't resist a Romeo ♫ ♫ in a sombrero wearing chaps ♫ ♫ Soon as I sit on their laps ♫ ♫ something inside of me snaps ♫ ♫ I can't say no ♫ It's like a I told ya, I just get sorry for him. Well, I wouldn't feel sorry for no man no matter what. But, see, with Ali Hakim now... Ali Hakim? Is that his name? Yeah. It's Persian. Are you sure for certain you love him better than you love Will? Well, I was sure. But now that Will has to come back home and first thing you know he'll be talkin' purdy to me and changing my mind back. But Will wants to marry you. Well, so does Ali Hakim. The peddler? Did he ask you? Well, not directly. But how I know is he said to me this mornin' when we was ridin' in his buggy, that he wanted for me to drive like that with him to the end of the world. Well, if we only drove as far as Catoosie, that'd take till sundown, wouldn't it? Then we'd have to go somewheres and spend all night together. And being together all night means he wants a wedding, don't it? Not to a peddler it don't. Hey, Aunt Eller. Hi, yourselves. Why, it's that peddler. One that sold me that eggbeater. Hey, peddler man, hold your horses. I wanna talk to you. You remember what you told me, hmm? Told me that eggbeater would beat up the eggs and wring out my dishrags and turn my ice cream freezer, and I don't know what all. All right. If the eggbeater don't work, I'll give you something just as good. Just as good? It better be a thousand million times better. Now, Aunt Eller, just listen to... I ain't your Aunt Eller. Don't you call me Aunt Eller, you little wart. Well, don't anybody wanna buy somethin'? Well, how about you, Miss Laurey. Come on. Must be wanting something, a purdy young girl like you, hmm? Me? 'Course I want something. I want a buckle made out of shiny silver to tassle onto my shoe. I want a dress with lace. Want perfume, wanna be purdy. Wanna smell like a honeysuckle vine. Give her a cake of soap. One thing I heard of, never had before a rubber-tired buggy. Cut glass sugar bowl. Want things I can't tell you about, not only things to look at and hold in your hands, but things to happen to you. Things so nice if they ever did happen to you your heart, it'd quit beatin', you'd fall down dead. (Ali) l got just the thing for you. The Elixir of Egypt. What's that? It's a secret formula. It belonged to Pharaoh's daughter. Smelling salts. But a special kind of a smelling salt. Now, read what it says on the label here. "Take a deep breath and you see everything clear." That's what Pharaoh's daughter used to do, you know? When she had a hard problem to decide like what prince she oughta marry or what dress to wear to a party, or if she oughtta cut off somebody's head, she'd take a whiff of this. Oh, fiddlesticks. I'll take a bottle of this, Mr. Peddler. Precious stuff. How much? Two bits. Throwin' away your money. Helps you decide what to do. Now, don't you want me to show you some purdy doo dads, huh? You know, with lace around the bottom here and purdy ribbons running in and out What, you mean fancy drawers? All made in Paris. Well, I don't wear that kind of thing myself. But I sure do like to look at 'em. Yeah. They're all right if you ain't going no place. Why don't you bring your trappings inside? Maybe I'll find you something to eat and drink. Ma'am. He is not gonna marry you. He is. He is. He said he was. He is. Well, ask him, why don't ya? Ali, me and Laurey have been having an argument. About what, baby? About what you meant when you said that about driving with me to the end of the world. I didn't really mean to the end of the world. Well, then, how far do you wanna go? Oh, about as far as, say, Claremore. To the hotel. What's at the hotel? Look, in front of the hotel is a veranda. Veranda. Inside is a lobby. Okay. Upstairs... Upstairs might be paradise. I thought they was just bedrooms. No. No? No, for you and me, baby, paradise. You see? I knew I was right and Laurey was wrong. You do wanna marry me, don't ya? Hey. What did you just say? I said, you do wanna marry me, don't ya? What did you say? I didn't say nothin'. (Will) Yoo hoo. Ado Annie, it's me, I'm back. Oh, foot. Just when-'Lo Will! That's Will Parker. Ado Annie! Hey! Woo, Will! How's my honeybunch? How's the sweetest 1 1 0-pound of sugar in the territory? Will, this is Ali Hakim. How are ya, Hak? Don't mind the way I talk. It's all right. I'm gonna marry her. Marry her. On purpose? Well, sure. No such of a thing. No, no, it's a wonderful thing to be married. Listen, I got a brother in Persia got six wives. Six wives? All at once? Sure. It's the way they do it in them countries. No. No. Not always. Got another brother in Persia got only one wife. Yeah, he's a bachelor. Come here. Look Will... Look Will nothing. Know what I got for first prize at the fair? $50! $50! Catch on? Your pa promised I can marry ya if I could get $50. That's right. He did. Know what I done with it? Huh? Spent it all on presents for you. But if you spent it, then you ain't got the cash. What I got's worth more than the cash. Fella who sold me the stuff told me. But Will... Stop saying, "But Will." When do I get a little kiss? Ado Annie, honey, you ain't been off of my mind since I left. All the time at the fairgrounds. Even when I was chasing steers. I'd rope one under the hooves and I'd pull him up sharp. And he'd land on his little rump. Then I'd think of you. Don't start talkin' purdy, Will. See a lot of beautiful gals in Kansas City, didn't give one a look. How could you see 'em if you didn't give 'em a look? I mean I didn't look loving at 'em. Like the way I look at you. Oh, Will. Please don't look at me that way. I can't bear it. Ain't gonna stop looking like this till you give me a little old kiss. Oh, what's a little old kiss? No. No. No, I won't. ♫ Supposin' I say that your lips are like cherries ♫ ♫ roses or berries, watcha gonna do? ♫ ♫ Can't you feel my heart palpitatin' and a bumpin'? ♫ ♫ Waitin' for somethin', somethin' nice from you ♫ No. ♫ I gotta get a kiss ♫ ♫ and it's gotta be quick or I'll jump in a creek and die ♫ ♫ What's a girl to say when you talk that way? ♫ Well, now, howdy. How y'all doin'? Good to see ya. ♫ Oh, what a beautiful mornin' ♫ ♫ Oh, what a beautiful day ♫ ♫ I got a beautiful feelin' ♫ ♫ Everything's goin' my way ♫ Hey, don't forget, Aunt Eller, you and me's got a date together. And if you make up a nice lunch, Well, maybe I'll bid for it. Oh, how we gettin' there, Curly? In that rig you made up? I'll ride a-straddle of them lights a-winkin' like lightenin' bugs! That there ain't no made-up rig, you hear me? l hired it over to Claremore. Lands, you did? Sure did. Purdy one, too. Changed my mind about cleaning the hen house today. Leavin' it till tomorrow. I gotta to quit early 'cause I'm drivin' Laurey over to the party tonight. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You're drivin' Laurey? Asked her. Curly, why don't you take the wagon down to the trough and get the team some water? Yeah. Right away, Aunt Eller. That's a right smart turnout. ♫ The wheels are yella, the upholstery's brown ♫ ♫ the dashboard's genuine leather ♫ ♫ with isinglass curtains you can roll right down ♫ ♫ in case there's a change in the weather ♫ Can I come, too, Curly? Just love to watch the way ya handle horses. That's about all I can handle, I guess. I can't believe that. Not from what I heard about ya. ♫ Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin' that I care to swap ♫ ♫ for that shiny little surrey with a fringe on the top ♫ Come on, boys, better get those hampers out under the trees where it's cool. Looks like Curly's took off with that Cummings girl. Oh, what do I care about that? Well, I thought Curly was supposed to be stuck on you. Well, I'd say he ain't stuck on her no more. Seeing is believing. Bye bye, Curly. Stop it. Well, that's right. You'll make her cry. How would you like it if you lost your man? It's all right. It's so sad. Don't you pay 'em no mind, Laurey. ♫ Why should a woman who is healthy and strong ♫ ♫ blubber like a baby if her man goes away? ♫ ♫ Weepin' and a-wailin' how he's done her wrong ♫ ♫ That's one thing you'll never hear me say ♫ ♫ Never gonna think that the man I lose ♫ ♫ is the only man among men ♫ ♫ I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care ♫ ♫ I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear ♫ ♫ I'll scrub my neck and I'll brush my hair ♫ ♫ and start all over again ♫ ♫ Many a new face will please my eye ♫ ♫ Many a new love will find me ♫ ♫ Never have I once looked back to sigh ♫ ♫ over the romance behind me ♫ ♫ Many a new day will dawn before I do ♫ ♫ Many a light lad may kiss and fly ♫ ♫ a kiss gone by is bygone ♫ ♫ Never have I asked an August sky ♫ ♫ where has last July gone? ♫ I never say that. ♫ Never have I wandered through the rye ♫ ♫ wondering where has some guy gone ♫ ♫ Many a new day will dawn before I do ♫ Miss Laurey, in jest, of course.

Thanks a lot. Ali Hakim. Hello, kiddo. Not sure I'm sorry to see you so happy. 'Cause what I gotta tell ya is gonna make you miserable. I gotta marry Will. Oh, well, that's sad news for me. Well, he is a fine fellow. Don't try to hide your feelings, Ali, I can't stand it. I'd rather you just come right out and say your heart is busted in two. Are you positive you got to marry Will? Sure shootin'. And there's no chance for you to change your mind? No chance. All right, then, my heart is busted in two. Oh, Ali, you do make up purdy things to say. Is that you, Annie? Hello, Pa. Watcha been shootin'? Rabbits. Is that true what I hear about Will Parker gettin' $50? That's right, Pa. And he wants to hold you to your promise. Too bad. Still and all, I can't go back on my word. See, Ali Hakim? I advise you to get the money off of him before he loses it all. Put it in your stocking or inside your corset where he can't get at it. Or can he? But, Pa, he ain't exactly kept it. He spent it all on presents. You see? I told ya. Now he can't have ya. I said it had to be $50 cash. Is that fair, Mr. Carnes? Who the hell are you? Well, this is Ali Hakim. Well, shut your face or I'll fill your behind so full of buckshot, you'll be walking around like a duck the rest of your life. Ali... if I don't have to marry Will, maybe your heart don't have to be busted in two, like you said. I did not say that. Oh, yes you did. No, I did not. You tryin' to make out that my daughter's a liar? No. I'm just making it clear of what a liar I am if she's telling the truth. What else you been saying to my daughter? Oh, an awful lot. When? Last night in the moonlight. Where? Alongside a haystack. Listen, Mr. Carnes... I'm listenin'. What else you been sayin'? He called me his Persian kitten. Why'd you call her that? I don't remember. I do. He said I was like a Persian kitten 'cause they was the cats with the soft around the tails. That's enough. In this part of the country that better be a proposal of marriage. See? That's what I thought. What do you think? Look, Mr. Carnes... I'm lookin'. I'm no good. Look, I'm a peddler. A peddler travels up and down and all around. And you'd hardly ever see your daughter no more. That'll be all right. Take care of her... son. Take care of my little rosebud. Aw, Pa, that's purdy. You sure for certain you can bear to let me go, Pa? Are you sure, Mr. Carnes? Just try changin' my mind. See what happens to ya. Ali Hakim, ain't it wonderful? Pa makin' up our minds for us. He won't change, neither, once he gives his word that you can have me. Well, you've got me. I know. I gotcha. Mrs. Ali Hakim, the peddler's bride. Ah! Wait'll I tell the girls. Hey, girls, guess what? I'm gonna become a bride! Fathers with shotguns, trapped. Tricked. Hoodblinked. Ambushed. ♫ Friend, what's on your mind? ♫ ♫ Why do you walk around and around? ♫ ♫ With your hands folded behind ♫ ♫ and your chin scraping the ground ♫ Twenty minutes ago I am free like a breeze. Free like a bird in the woodland wild. Free like a gypsy. Free like a child. I'm unattached. Twenty minutes ago I can do what I please. Flick my cigar ashes on the rug. Dunk with a doughnut. Drink from a jug. Hey, I'm a happy man. I'm minding my own business like I oughtta. Ain't meaning any harm to anyone. I'm talking to a certain farmer's daughter and then I'm looking down the muzzle of a gun. ♫ It's getting so you can't have any fun ♫ ♫ Every daughter has a father with a gun ♫ A big gun they got on them. ♫ It's a scandal, it's an outrage ♫ ♫ how a gal gets a husband today ♫ ♫ If you make one mistake, then the moon is bright ♫ ♫ then they tie you to a contract ♫ ♫ so you'll make it every night ♫ ♫ It's a scandal, it's an outrage ♫ ♫ when her family surrounds you and say ♫ ♫ you gotta take and make an honest woman outta Nell ♫ ♫ To make you make her honest, she will lie like hell ♫ ♫ It's a scandal, it's an outrage ♫ ♫ on our manhood it's a blot ♫ You got it. ♫ Where is the leader who will save us ♫ ♫ from being the first man to be shot ♫ What, me?

Come on. ♫ It's a scandal, it's an outrage ♫ ♫ It's a problem we must crack ♫ Look, there he is! ♫ I've got the answer ♫ ♫ I go away and don't come back ♫ I gotta get home right now. I gotta run. I got places I gotta go. Gotta get your hamper packed. Well, you sure do have a lot of company. Hello, Laurey. Just packing your hamper now? I've been busy. You got gooseberry tarts, too. I wonder if they is as light as mine. Mine would like to float away if you blew on 'em. I did blow on one of mine and it broke into a million pieces. Well, ain't you funny. Gertie, why don't you come inside and cool off? You comin' inside with me, Curly? Not just yet. Well, don't be too long. And don't forget, when the auction starts tonight, mine's the biggest hamper. So, that's the Cummings girl I hear so much talk of. You seen her before, ain't ya? Yeah. But not since she got so old. Never did see anyone get so peaked looking in such a short time. Yeah, and she says she's only 1 8. I bet ya she's 1 9. Watcha got in your hamper? Oh, just some old meat pies and apple jelly. Nothing like what Gertie Cummings has got in her basket. So you... you're really gonna drive to the Box Social tonight with that Jud feller? Reckon so. Why? Nothin'. Well, it's just that everybody seems to expect me to take you. Then maybe it's just as well you ain't. We don't want people talking about us, do we? You think people do talk about us? You know how they are. Like a swarm of mud wasps always gotta be buzzin' about somethin'. Well, what are they sayin'? Oh, that you're stuck on me. Most of the talk is that you're stuck on me. Well, I can't imagine how these ugly rumors start. Me neither. ♫ Why do they think up stories that link ♫ ♫ my name with yours? ♫ ♫ Why do the neighbors chatter all day ♫ ♫ behind their doors? ♫ ♫ I know a way to prove what they say ♫ ♫ is quite untrue ♫ ♫ Here is the gist, a practical list of don'ts ♫ ♫ for you ♫ Uh huh. ♫ Don't throw bouquets at me ♫ Oh. ♫ Don't please my folks too much ♫ Aunt Eller? ♫ Don't laugh at my jokes too much ♫ ♫ People will say we're in love ♫ Who laughs at your jokes? ♫ Don't sigh and gaze at me ♫ ♫ Your sighs are so like mine ♫ ♫ Your eyes mustn't glow like mine ♫ ♫ People will say we're in love ♫ ♫ Don't start collecting things ♫ Whoa, whoa, whoa. Like what? ♫ Give me my rose and my gloves ♫ No, no, no. ♫ Sweetheart, they're suspecting things ♫ ♫ People will say we're in love ♫ ♫ Some people claim that you are to blame ♫ ♫ as much as I ♫ ♫ Why do you take the trouble to bake ♫ ♫ my favorite pie? ♫ It is? ♫ Granting your wish I carved our initials ♫ ♫ on the tree ♫ ♫ Just keep a slice of all the advice you give ♫ ♫ so free ♫ Uh huh. ♫ Don't praise my charm too much ♫ ♫ Don't look so vain with me ♫ Vain? ♫ Don't stand in the rain with me ♫ ♫ People will say we're in love ♫ ♫ Don't take my arm too much ♫ Let go. ♫ Don't keep your hand in mine ♫ ♫ Your hand feels so grand in mine ♫ ♫ People will say we're in love ♫ ♫ Don't dance all night with me ♫ ♫ till the stars fade from above ♫ ♫ They'll see it's all right with me ♫ ♫ People will say we're in love ♫ Don't you reckon you could just tell that Jud fella you'd rather go with me tonight? Curly... Hmm? No, I couldn't. You couldn't. Well, I think I'll go down to the smokehouse where Jud's at just to see what's so elegant about him, makes girls wanna go to parties with him. Curly. What? Nothin'. ♫ Don't sigh ♫ ♫ and gaze at me ♫ ♫ Your sighs ♫ ♫ are so like mine ♫ ♫ Your eyes mustn't... ♫ You got your hamper packed? Oh, Aunt Eller. Yes, nearly. Would you like a hanky? What do I want with an old hanky? Well, you got a smudge on your cheek. No. Just under your eye. Aunt Eller, don't go to Skidmore's with Curly tonight. If you do I'll have to ride with Jud all alone. Well, that's the way you wanted it, ain't it? No. But I did it 'cause Curly was so fresh. But I'm afraid to tell Jud I won't go with him, Aunt Eller. He'd do somethin' terrible. Well, you ever been down that old smokehouse where he's at? Yeah, plenty of times. Did you see them pictures he's got tacked onto the walls? Yeah. I seen 'em. Don't you pay them no heed. There's somethin' wrong inside of him, Aunt Eller. I hook my door at night and fasten my windows again. Again. What? It. And the sound of feet walkin' on down out there under that tree outside my room. Laurey... I know what I'm talkin' about. You crazy yellin'. Now, you stop acting like a chicken that's had its head cut off. Laurey. Now, Laurey, I got to thinkin' about how you don't have a right lot to wear, except your mother's old wedding dress. And I, well, I saved up my pennies and I got you somethin'. What is it? Well, now... Aunt Eller! Oh my Lord. Thank you so much. Yeah, well, try it on. It's beautiful. Yes. Well, open it, can't ya? Howdy. What do you want? Well, I done got through my business up here at the house, I just thought I'd pay you a call. You got a gun, I see. Good one. Colt. 45. Wooee, watcha do with it? Shoot things. Oh. Hey, that there pink picture's a naked woman, ain't it? Your eyes don't lie to you. She's plumb star naked as a jaybird. Actually, no. No, she ain't. Not quite. She got a couple a thing-a-bobs tied on her there. Shucks. That ain't a thing to what I got here. Take a look at that top one. Whew. I'll go blind. That'd give me ideas, that would. That's a dinger, that is. Oh yeah, that sure is a dinger. Hey, that's a good lookin' rope you got there. Hey, you know Will Parker? Yeah, well, he can sure spin a rope. It's a strong hook you got there, Jud. You can hang yourself on that. I could what? Uh, uh, hang yourself. Well, yeah, it'd... it'd be as easy as falling off a log. Matter of fact you could stand on a log or a chair, if you'd rather, right about here, see? Just put this here around your neck, tie that good up there first, of course. And all you'd have to do would be to fall off the log. Or the chair, whichever you'd rather fall off of. And in five minutes or less with good luck you'd be, you'd be dead as a doornail. What do you mean by that? Well, then, and folks would come to your funeral and sing sad songs. Oh, they would. Well, you never know how many people like ya till you're dead. You know... you'd probably be laid out in that parlor all decked out in your best suit. Your hair combed down slick in a high starched collar. Hmm? Would there be any flowers, you think? Sure would. And palms, too, all around your coffin. And then, then folks would gather around you and the men would bare their heads and the women, the women would sniffle softly. Well, some would probably faint. You know, the ones that took a shine to you when you was alive. Women never took a shine to me. Oh, lots of women. You see, they don't never come right out and show you how they feel unless you die first. I guess that's so. They sure would sing loud, though, when the singing started. Sing like their hearts are breaking. ♫ Poor Jud is dead ♫ ♫ Poor Jud Fry is dead ♫ ♫ All gather around his coffin now and cry ♫ ♫ He had a heart of gold and he wasn't very old ♫ ♫ Oh, why did such a fella have to die? ♫ ♫ Poor Jud is dead ♫ ♫ Poor Jud Fry is dead ♫ ♫ He's looking oh so peaceful and serene ♫ ♫ And serene ♫ ♫ He's all laid out to rest ♫ ♫ with his hands across his chest ♫ ♫ His fingernails have never been so clean ♫ Then the preacher would get up and he'd say, "Folks, we gathered here today to moan and groan "over our brother Jud Fry. "Hung his self up by a rope in the smokehouse." Then there'd be weepin' and wailin' from some of those women. Then he'd say, Jud was the most misunderstood man in the territory. People used to think that he was a mean ugly fella. And they called him a dirty skunk and an ornery pig stealer. ♫ But the folks that really knowed him ♫ ♫ know that beneath them two dirty shirts ♫ ♫ he always wore there beat a heart ♫ ♫ as big as all outdoors ♫ ♫ As big as all outdoors ♫ ♫ Jud Fry loved his fellow man ♫ ♫ He loved his fellow man ♫ ♫ He loved the birds of the forests ♫ ♫ and the beasts of the field ♫ ♫ He loved the mice and the vermin in the barn ♫ ♫ and he treated the rats like equals, which was right ♫ Oh, and he loved the little children. No, no, no, he loved everybody and everything in the whole world. Only he never let on so nobody ever knowed it. ♫ Poor Jud is dead, poor Jud Fry is dead ♫ ♫ His friends will weep and wail ♫ ♫ for miles around ♫ ♫ Miles around ♫ ♫ The daisies in the dell will give out a different smell ♫ ♫ Because poor Jud is underneath the ground ♫ ♫ Poor Jud is dead ♫ ♫ A candle lights his head ♫ ♫ He's layin' in a coffin made of wood ♫ ♫ Wood ♫ ♫ And folks are feelin' sad ♫ ♫ 'cause they used to treat him bad ♫ ♫ And now they know their friend has gone for good ♫ ♫ Good ♫ ♫ Poor Jud is dead ♫ ♫ A candle lights his head ♫ ♫ He's lookin' oh so purdy ♫ ♫ and so nice ♫ Shh, shh, shh. ♫ He looks like he's asleep ♫ ♫ It's a shame that he won't keep ♫ ♫ But it's summer and we're running out of ice ♫ ♫ Poor Jud ♫ Yes sir. That's how it'd be. That sure would be an interesting funeral. I wouldn't wanna miss it. Wouldn't wanna miss it, huh? Maybe you will. Maybe you'd go first. Maybe. Yeah... Let's see now. Where'd you work at before you come up here? It's up by Quapaw, wasn't it? Yeah. Before that, over by Tulsa. Lousy they was to me, both of 'em. Always makin' out they were better. Always treatin' me like dirt. What'd you do? Did you get even? If it'd ever come to gettin' even with somebody, I'd know how to do it. That? No. There's safer ways than that if you use your brain. You remember that fire on the Bartlett farm over by Sweetwater? About five years ago, terrible accident. That burned up the father, mother, and daughter. Yeah, well, that there weren't no accident. Fella told me the hired hand was stuck on the Bartlett girl and he found her in the hay loft with another feller. And it was him that burnt the place? Took him weeks to get up the kerosene. Buying it up at different times. The fella who told me, made out like it happened in Missouri, but I knowed all along it was the Bartlett farm. What a liar he was. And kind of a murderer too. Wasn't he? Let's get a little air in here. You ain't told me yet what business you have here. We ain't got no cattle to sell ya, there are no cow ponies and the oat crop's done spoke for. You sure relieved my mind considerable. There can only be one other thing you want on this farm. It better not be that. But that's just what it is. Better not be. You stay away from her, you hear? A fellow wouldn't feel very safe in here with you, Jud, if he didn't know ya. But I know ya. See, in this country, there's two things you can do if you're a man. Live outdoors is one and livin' in a hole is the other. As long as you live in a hole, you're scared. You gotta have protection. Yeah, you can have muscles like iron and still be as weak as an empty bladder unless you got things to barb your hide with. How'd you get to be the way you are anyway? You're sittin' here in this filthy hole thinkin' the way you're thinkin'. You oughta do something healthy once in a while. Instead of staying shut up in here crawling and festering. Well, you oughta feel better now. That's hard on the roof though. Well, I wish you'd let me show you something. You see that knothole over there, about as big as a dime? See it a-winkin'? I just wanna see if I can hit it. Well, that's a bullet right through the center. Slick as a whistle, without touchin', didn't I? See, I knowed I could do it. You saw it, didn't ya? Why someone's comin', I expect. Who fired off that gun? Curly, was that you? Well, don't just sit there, you lummy. Answer when you're spoken to. I shot once. Well, what was you shootin' at? See that knothole over there? I see lots of knotholes. Yeah, well, it was one of them. Well, ain't you a pair of purdy nothins, huh? Pickin' away at knotholes and scaring everybody half to death. I oughta give you a Dutch rub and iron the craziness outta you. It's all right. Ain't nobody hurt. Just a pair of fools swapping noises. Mind if I visit with you gents? Yeah, it's good to get away from the women for awhile, huh? Now, then. We are by ourselves. I got a few purdies. Private knick knacks to show you, special for the men folks. I'll see you gentlemen later. I gotta get a surrey I hired for tonight. Who do you think you're takin' in that surrey? Aunt Eller. And Laurey, if she'll come with me. She won't. Maybe she will. She promised to go with me. She better not change her mind. She better not! Now, I want you to look at these. Straight from Paris. I don't want none of them things now. I'll tell you what I'd like if you got one. You ever heard of one of them things you call the Little Wonder? It's a thing you hold up to your eye to see pictures. Only that ain't all there is to it. Not quite. It's got a jigger onto it. And you touch it and down springs a sharp blade. On a spring, huh? You say to a feller, look through this and then when he's lookin', you snap the blade out. It's just above his chest and then, bang, down you go. That's a good joke to play on a friend. No. I don't like to handle things like that. It's too dangerous. Now, what I'd like to show you is my new stock of postcards. I'm sick of them things. Now, I'm gonna get me a real woman. I'm tired of all these pictures of women. So, you want a real woman, huh? Yeah. Say... you ever happen to hear of a girl named Ado Annie? I don't want her. I don't want her either, but I got her. I don't want nothin' from no peddler man. I want real things! What am I doin'? Crawlin' and festerin'. What am I doin' in this lousy smokehouse? ♫ The floor creaks ♫ ♫ The door squeaks ♫ ♫ There's a field mouse nibblin' on the broom ♫ ♫ And I sit by myself like a cobweb on a shelf ♫ ♫ by myself in a lonely room ♫ ♫ But when there's a moon in my winder ♫ ♫ And it slants down a beam across my bed ♫ ♫ and the shadow of a tree starts a dancin' on the wall ♫ ♫ and a dream starts dancin' in my head ♫ ♫ And all of the things that I wish for ♫ ♫ turn out like I want them to be ♫ ♫ And I'm better than that smart aleck cowhand ♫ ♫ who thinks he's better than me ♫ ♫ And the girl that I want ♫ ♫ ain't afraid of my arms ♫ ♫ And her own soft arms keep me warm ♫ ♫ And her long tangled hair falls across my face ♫ ♫ just like a rain in a storm ♫ ♫ The floor creeks ♫ ♫ The door squeaks ♫ ♫ And the mouse starts nibblin' on the broom ♫ ♫ And the sun flicks my eyes ♫ ♫ It was all a pack of lies ♫ ♫ I'm awake in a lonely room ♫ ♫ I ain't gonna dream about her arms no more ♫ ♫ I ain't gonna leave her alone ♫ ♫ Goin' outside, get myself a bride ♫ ♫ Get me a woman to call my own ♫ To your house. A dog? Look at that. Did you see that? Come on, now. Take a card. Girls, could you go somewhere else and tell fortunes? I gotta be here by myself. She brought out old smelling salts the peddler tried to sell us. Well, it ain't smelling salts that's gonna make my mind up for me. Well, look at me take a good whiff now. That's the camphor. Please, girls, go away. Hey, Laurey, is it true you're gonna let Jud take you tonight instead of Curly? Tell you about it when I think everything out clear. Beginning to see things clear already. I can tell you what you want. ♫ Out of your dreams and into his arms ♫ ♫ you long to fly ♫ ♫ You don't need Egyptian smelling salts ♫ ♫ to tell you why ♫ ♫ Out of your dreams and into the hush ♫ ♫ of falling shadows ♫ ♫ When the mist is low ♫ ♫ And stars are breaking through ♫ ♫ Then out of your dreams you'll go ♫ ♫ into a dream come true ♫ ♫ Make up your mind, make up your mind, Laurey ♫ ♫ Laurey, dear, make up your own ♫ ♫ make up your own story ♫ ♫ Laurey, dear ♫ ♫ OI' Pharaoh's daughter won't tell you what to do ♫ ♫ Ask your heart ♫ ♫ Whatever it tells you will be true ♫ ♫ Out of my dreams and into your arms ♫ ♫ I long to fly ♫ ♫ I will come as evening comes ♫ ♫ to woo a waiting sky ♫ ♫ Out of my dreams and into the hush ♫ ♫ of falling shadows ♫ ♫ When the mist is low ♫ ♫ and stars are breaking through ♫ ♫ And out of my dreams I'll go ♫ ♫ into a dream with you ♫ No! Laurey? Wake up, Miss Laurey. It's time to start for the party. Come on. Come on. Over there. Come on. That's it. Watch it. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey, I'm talkin' to you, Chalmers, you stupid mule. You just drop that schoolhouse. I never understood you cow folks. Hey, hey, hey. Come on now. Now, stop that right now. Come on, let me at him. Now, I'll tell you what. Hey, Aunt Eller, what's going on? ♫ The farmer and the cowman should be friends ♫ ♫ Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends ♫ ♫ One man likes to push a plow ♫ ♫ The other likes to chase a cow ♫ ♫ But that's no reason why they can't be friends ♫ ♫ Territory folks should stick together ♫ ♫ Territory folks should all be pals ♫ ♫ Cowboys dance with the farmers' daughters ♫ ♫ Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals ♫ ♫ Territory folks should stick together ♫ ♫ Territory folks should all be pals ♫ ♫ Farmers dance with the farmers' daughters ♫ ♫ Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals ♫ (Aunt Eller) Come on, now. That's right. What's the matter, Curly, don't you know how to dance? This is probably the only dance you're gonna get. Fred, will you help me out now, will ya? Come on. Listen. ♫ I'd like to say a word for the farmer ♫ Just say it. ♫ He come out West and made a lot of changes ♫ ♫ He come out West and built a lot of fences ♫ You say it, Will. ♫ And built 'em right across our cattle ranges ♫ That's right. Why don't those dirt scratchers stay in Missouri where they belong? Hell, we got as much right here as anybody else. Let me at him. Stop now. You reckon so? I reckon so. Hey. Shut up. ♫ The farmer is a good and thrifty citizen ♫ He's thrifty all right. ♫ No matter what the cowman says or thinks ♫ ♫ You'll seldom see him drinking at a bar room ♫ ♫ Unless somebody else is buying drinks ♫ You can't say that about farmers. ♫ The cowman should be friends ♫ ♫ Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends ♫ ♫ The cowman ropes a cow with his ease ♫ ♫ The farmer steals their butter and cheese ♫ ♫ But that's no reason why they can't be friends ♫ ♫ Territory folks should stick together ♫ ♫ Territory folks should all be pals ♫ ♫ Cowboys dance with the farmers' daughters ♫ ♫ Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals ♫ ♫ I'd like to say a word for the cowboy ♫ Oh, you would. ♫ The road he treads is difficult and stony ♫ ♫ He rides for days on end with just a pony for a friend ♫ ♫ I sure am feeling sorry for the pony ♫ ♫ The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy ♫ ♫ if he rides by and asks for food and water ♫ ♫ Don't treat him like a louse ♫ ♫ Make him welcome in your house ♫ ♫ But make sure that you lock up your wife and daughter ♫ Now, that's not right, now. Ah, who needs an old farm woman anyway? Noticed you married one so as you could get a square meal. Yeah, you can't talk that way about our womenfolk. Would you shut up? He can say what he wants to say. Now, you stop that. Come on. Hey! Ain't nobody gonna slug out anything. This here is a party.

Come on, everybody. It's time to start the Box Social. Gentlemen, y'all know the rules. Gotta bid blind. You ain't supposed to know what girl goes with what hamper. 'Course if your sweetheart's told you that hers is done up in a certain kind of way with a certain color ribbon, well, that ain't my fault. Now we're gonna auction with all of the hampers up around the wagon. Follow me. Come on now. Thank you, honey. You all right now? Oh, here we go. My favorite moment. Psst. Hello, young fellow. Oh, it's you. I was just hoping to meet up with you. It seems like you and me ought to have a little talk. We only got one thing to talk about. Well, Mr. Hakim, I hear you got yourself engaged to Ado Annie. Yeah... Well, nothing. I don't know what to call you. You ain't pretty enough for a skunk, you ain't skinny enough for a snake. You're too little to be a man and too big to be a mouse. I reckon you're a rat. That's logical. Hey, answer me one question. Do you really love her? 'Cause if I thought you didn't, I'd tie you up in this bag and I'd drop you in the river. Are you serious about her? Yes, I'm serious. Would you spend every cent you had for her? That's what I did. See that bag full of presents? Cost me 50 bucks. All I had in the world. If you had $50 cash... I'd have Ado Annie and you'd lose her. Yes. I'd lose her. Let's see what you got in here, I might want to buy something. What would you want with them? I'm a peddler, ain't I? I buy and sell. You know, maybe I'd pay you real money. Maybe as much as, well, a lot. Ah. What a beautiful hot water bag. Well, now, it looks French. It must've cost plenty. I'll give you $8 for it. $8? That wouldn't be honest. I only paid $3.50. All right. All right. I said I'd give ya $8 for it, and I will. Say... That's a crackerjack. Take your hands off that. That was for our wedding night. Yeah, don't fit you so good. I'll pay you $22. I only paid... All right. All right. $22.50. Not a cent more. You wanna buy some more? I might. You ever see one of these things? What made you buy this for? You got it in for somebody? What do you mean? It's just funny pictures. That's all you think it is. Well, it's more than that. Where is everybody? Where's Aunt Eller? At the auction, Laurey. (Jud) Laurey! Laurey! How much you give me for this thing? I don't like to handle things like this. You don't know what it is. (Will) It's just a girl in pink tights. Either you two seen Laurey? Just went over yonder. Auction's going on there. Hey, Jud, you know, here's one of them things you was lookin' for, the Little Wonder. How much? $3.50. That's a lot of money. But I got an idea it might be worth it. Here's 4. Four and... Now, let's see. $3.50 from him. $45.50 from you. That makes $50, don't it? (Ali) No, $1 short. (Will) How much for the rest of the stuff in the bag? (Ali) One dollar. (Will) Done. And when I tell her pa who I got most of the money off, maybe he'll change his mind about who's smart and who's dumb. Say, young fella, you know, you certainly buncoed me. Hey, Aunt Eller. Two more hampers over here. These here are the last two hampers. Whose they are I ain't got no idea. Oh, that one's mine. And the one next to it's Laurey's. Well, that's the end of that secret. Now, what do I hear for Ado Annie's hamper? I'll give you two bits. Four. Four. Who says six? Slim? Ain't nobody hungry no more? What about you peddler man? Six bits. Come on. Six bits. Six bits ain't enough for a lunch like Ado Annie can make. What about you, Mike? You won her last year. Yeah, that's right. Say, Ado Annie, you got that same sweet potato pie like last year? You bet. Yeah, same old sweet potato pie, Mike. What do you say? I say it gave me a three-day belly ache. Well, never mind about that. Come on now, let me hear... Bid a dollar. Ninety cents. (Aunt Eller) Ninety cents. Another desk for the schoolhouse. Aint' I gonna hear any more? (Will) You hear $50. Hey. (Aunt Eller) $50? Ain't nobody ever bid $50 for lunch, Will. Ain't nobody ever bid 1 0. He ain't got $50. Oh, yes I have. And if you were a man of honor, you gotta say Ado Annie belongs to me. Like you said she would. Where's your money? Right here in my hand. (Woman) He got it. That ain't yours. You just bid that. Just give that to the schoolhouse. Right. Absolutely. I got to say the peddler man still gets my daughter's hand. Now, wait a minute. That ain't fair. Well, it's goin' for $50. It's going. It's going. It's... $51. Are you crazy? Fifty... What? Wait a minute. If I don't bid no more, I can keep my money, can't I? Sure can. Then I still got $50. This is mine. You feeble-minded shag poke. It's going for $51. It's going. It's going. It's gone. Yeah. And that means, Ado Annie gets the prize, I guess. That's a $50 bill, ma'am. Fifty dollar bill. And I get Ado Annie. Woo! What do you get for your $51? A three-day belly ache. (Aunt Eller) Now, listen. Come on now. Hey. Now, this here is my niece's hamper. I took a peek in that a while ago and I must say it looked mighty tasty. So, what do I hear, Jim? (Jim) Two bits. (Aunt Eller) Two bits. (Man) Four bits. (Aunt Eller) Four bits. What do you say, Slim, six? I say six bits. Yeah, more like it. Come on, let me hear a $1. One dollar. (Aunt Eller) One dollar. One dollar. $1.50. Two dollars. Two bits. $2 dollars and four bits. Call it now. Three dollars. Three dollars. And two bits. Ain't I gonna hear any more? Curly, come on, Curly. Now, I got a bid here. Three and a quarter dollars. To Jud Fry. Well, Andrew, you gonna let him have it? Three and a half. Three and a half. Woo! Going. It's going... $3.75. (Aunt Eller) $3.75. Yeah, well, come on, gentlemen. Schoolhouse ain't built yet. Gotta have a nice chimney. Four dollars. Four dollars. It's going. It's going. It's... And two bits. That's too rich for my blood. Can't afford no more. It's going to Jud Fry. It's going. It's going. It's... Who'd you say was gettin' Laurey? Jud Fry. And how much? (Aunt Eller) Four and a quarter. I don't figure that's quite enough, do you? More than you got. No, I got a saddle here that cost me $30. Well, you can't bid saddles. Huh. It got to be cash. Okay, well, $30 saddle must be worth somethin' to somebody. Hmm? Huh? I'll give you 1 0. Don't be a fool, boy. You can't earn a living without a saddle. You got cash? Right in my pocket. All right. Well, don't let's waste any time. How high are you goin'? Higher than you no matter what. Ooh-ee. Well, Aunt Eller... I'm gonna bid all this $1 0 that Tom's just give me. Well, it's goin' for $1 0. It's going. It's going. $1 0 and 2 bits. Curly... Okay, most of you boys know my horse. Dun. Hmm? She's kinda a nice horse, gentle or broke. Don't sell Dun, Curly. It ain't worth it. I'll give you 25 for her. I'll sell Dun to ya. Well... That makes the bid 35, Aunt Eller. Woo, Curly. You crazy. But it's all for the schoolhouse. Ain't it? It's all for educatin' and learnin'. (Crowd) Yeah. That's right. Laurey's goin' for $35. It's going. It's going. Hold on. Hold on. I ain't through bidding yet. You just put up everything you got in the world, didn't you? Can't bid the clothes on your back 'cause they ain't worth nothin'. You can't bid your gun 'cause you need that. Yes sir, you need that bad. So, Aunt Eller, I'm just as reckless as Curly McLain, I guess. Just as good at gettin' what I want. I'm gonna put up everything I got in the world. All I saved for two years doing farmwork. All for Laurey. Here it is. $42.31. Oh. Oh my word. Anybody wanna buy a gun? Cord, bought that brand new last Thanksgiving. That's worth a lot. Curly, please don't sell your gun. Hmm? I'll give you $1 8 for it. Sold. Well, that makes my bid $53, Aunt Eller. Anybody goin' any higher? Goin', goin', gone. Well, what's the matter with you folks? Ain't nobody gonna cheer or nothin'? ♫ Dum diddy dum dum dum ♫ ♫ Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends ♫ That's the idea. Cowman and the farmer should be friends. Now, you lost the bid. But the biddin' was fair. (Man) That's right. Curly, shake the farmer's hand. Sure. I'll shake your hand. And no hard feelings, Curly. No hard feelings, that's right, now, Jud. I'm sorry about that. Curly, come on, give me the... Oh. Thank you. That's all right, now. Curly? Curly. I wanna show you somethin'. Excuse us, Laurey. You ever seen one of them things? Just what is that? Well, it's something special, see? You hold it up to your eye like this. Take a look. No, go on. You gotta hold it. Huh? (Jud) Yeah. Go on. Now, hold it. (Aunt Eller) Curly! Curly, what you doin'? Doin'? Nothin' much. Why do you wanna squeal at a man like that for? You scared the livin' lights outta a fella. Come here. Well, why don't you stop lookin' at those old French pictures and ask me to dance? You brung me to the party, didn't ya? I'll dance with ya, you silly old woman. I'll dance you all over the meadow if you want. Pick that banjo to pieces, Sam. All right. Hey, Curly. After you two dance you gotta take a look at this. I'll be right here. You turn the ... picture. (Aunt Eller) Oh, come on. Hey, peddler man, it's my turn to dance with her now. Hey, Laurey, I gotta talk to you. Hey, Laurey, I gotta talk. Laurey! Laurey! Laurey! Woo! Well, Ado Annie, I got the $50 cash. Now, you name the day. August 1 5th. Why August 1 5th? That was the first night I was kissed. Was it? I don't remember that. You wasn't there. Now, looky here, we gotta have a serious talk. Now that you're engaged to me you gotta stop having fun. I mean with other fellers. ♫ You have to be a little more standoffish ♫ ♫ when fellas offer you a buggy ride ♫ ♫ I'll give an imitation of a crawfish ♫ ♫ and dig myself a hole where I can hide ♫ ♫ I heard how you was kicking up some capers ♫ ♫ when I was up in Kansas City, MO ♫ ♫ I heard some things you couldn't print in papers ♫ ♫ from fellers who been talking like they know ♫ Foot! ♫ I only did the kind of things I oughta, sorta ♫ ♫ To you I was as faithful as can be, for me ♫ ♫ Them stories 'bout the way I lost my bloomer-Rumors ♫ ♫ A lot o' tempest in a pot of tea ♫ ♫ The whole thing don't sound very good to me ♫ Well, you see...

Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, now, Laurey. Why are we stoppin'? I thought you wanted to dance. I wanna talk to ya. What made you slap that whip onto Old Eighty? And it make her run away? What was your hurry? Afraid we'd be late for the party. You didn't wanna be left with me by yourself. Not a minute more than you had to, didn't you? I don't know what you're talking about. With you by myself now, ain't I? You wouldn't have been if you coulda got out of it. Mornin's you stay hidden in your room all the time. Nights you sit in the front room and won't get outta Aunt Eller's sight. Last time I seen you alone it was the winter and the snow was six-feet deep in drifts and I was sick and you brought that hot soup out to the smokehouse and you gave it to me, and me in bed... I hadn't shaved in two days. And you asked me if I had a fever. And you put your hand on my head to see. I remember. Do ya? I bet you don't remember as much as me. I remember everything you ever done. Every word you've ever said. I can't think of nothin' else. See? You see how it is? Laurey. Now, Laurey. Let go. I ain't good enough for you, am I? I'm just a hired hand. Got dirt on my hands. Pig slop! Ain't fit to touch you. You're better. You're so much better. No. We'll see who's better, Miss Laurey. We'll see who's better. And then maybe you won't be so free with your airs. You're such a fine lady. No! No! Are you making threats to me? You keep standin' there trying to tell me that if I don't allow you to slobber over me like a hog, what, are you gonna do something about it? Why, you're nothing but a mangy dog and somebody oughtta shoot you. You think so much about being a hired hand. I'll just tell you something that'll rest your brain, Mr. Jud. You ain't a hired hand for me no more, so you can just pack up your duds and scoot. And I even got better ideas than that. You ain't to come on the place again. You hear me? I'll send your stuff any place you say, but don't so much as set foot inside the pasture gate or I'll sic the dogs on you. You said your say. You brought it on yourself. I can't help it. I can't never rest. I told you the way it was. And you wouldn't listen. Who's that? Oh, it's me, Laurey. Hey, have you seen Ado Annie? She's gone again. Will? Uh-huh? Could you do somethin' for me? Go and find Curly and tell him I'm here. I wanna see Curly real bad. I gotta see him. Then why don't you turn around and look then, you crazy woman? Curly. Well, you got yours. I gotta go hunt for mine. Hey, hey. Now, now. What on earth is ailing the belle of Claremore? By gum if you ain't cryin'. Don't mind me a-cryin'. I can't help it. Well, you cry your eyes out. Shh. Shh. I don't know what to do. Well, here, I'll show you. Oh my goodness. Oh, that's just... That's just about all a man can stand in public. Oh, oh, oh. Go away from me, you. You don't like me, Curly. Like ya? My God, you get away from me, I tell ya. You just stay a-plumb away from me. Curly, you sittin' on a stove! Ah! Doh! It's cold as a hunk of ice. Laurey... Okay, now you... You stand there right where you are. And I'm gonna... Ow! Gosh. I'm gonna sit over here and you tell me what you wanted with me. Jud was here. Okay. And he scared me. Well, he's crazy. I never saw no one like him. He started talkin' wild and he threatened me. So I fired him. I wished I hadn't. Well, there ain't no telling what he'll do now. You fired him? Uh-huh. Well, okay, that's all there is to it. Tomorrow I'll get you a new hired hand. And I'll stay in the place myself tonight if you're nervous about that hound dog. Now, quit your worrying about it or I'll spank ya. And, hey... while I think about it, how about... how about... marrying me? Gracious. What'd I wanna marry you for? Well... Couldn't you maybe think up some reason why you might? Can't think of none right now hardly. Laurey... Please, ma'am, marry me. L... I just don't know what I'm gonna do if you don't. Curly... I'll marry you. If you want me to. Oh, I'd be the happiest man alive as soon as we are married. I gotta learn to be a farmer. Oh no, I see that. I gotta quit worrying about throwing the rope and startin' to get my hands blistered a new way. Things are changing right and left. I gotta buy mowin' machines and cut down the prairies. Shoe your horses, drag them plows under the sod. You know... They are gonna make a state out of this territory. And they're gonna put it in the union. Country's a-changin'. You gotta change with it. Bring up a pair of boys. New stock just to keep up the way things is going in this here crazy country. So now I got you to help me. I'm going to amount to something yet. You know... I remember the very first time I ever seen you. It was at the fair riding that little grey filly of Blue Stars. And I said to someone, I said, "Who's that skinny little thing with "a bang hanging down on her forehead?" I remember. And you was riding the broncs that day. That's right. And one of them throwed ya. That's... Did not throw me. Guess you jumped off that. Sure, yeah. No, I jumped off. Yeah, you sure did. Hey! If there's anybody at around this yard that can hear my voice, oh, I'd like for you to know that Laurey Williams is my girl. Curly! And she went and got me to ask her to marry me. They'll hear you all the way to Catoosie. Let 'em. ♫ Let people say we're in love ♫ ♫ Who cares what happens now ♫ ♫ Just keep your hand in mine ♫ ♫ Your hand feels so grand in mine ♫ ♫ Let people say we're in love ♫ ♫ Starlight looks well on us ♫ ♫ Let the stars beam from above ♫ ♫ Who cares if they tell on us ♫ ♫ Let people say we're in love ♫ Time for the lonely gypsy to go back to the open road. Wished I was goin' with ya. Then you wouldn't have to be so lonely. Look, Ado Annie, there is a man I know who loves you like nothin' ever loved nobody. Yes, Ali Hakim. No, no, no. A man who will stick to you all your life. And that's the man for you. Mm hmm. Will Parker. Oh. Yeah, well, I like Will a lot, but he... Look, he is a fine fellow, huh? Strong like an ox. Young and handsome. Oh, I love him all right, I guess. 'Course you do. You love those clear blue eyes of his, huh? The way his mouth wrinkles up when he smiles. So, you love him, too? Look, I love him because he will make my Ado Annie happy. Well... goodbye, my baby. Oh. I will show you how we say goodbye in my country. Goodbye. Good... I am glad you will marry such a wonderful man as this Will Parker. You deserve a fine man. And you got one. Oh, hey, Will. Ah. Ali Hakim was just saying goodbye. Will. I want to say goodbye to you, too. No you don't. I just saw the last one. You were made for each other. Now, you be good to her, Will. And you be good to him. Oh. You don't mind? I am a friend of the family now. See? Goodbye, my baby. A friend of the family. Persian goodbye. Lucky fellow. No, no, you know, I wish it was me she was marrying instead of you. Don't seem to make much difference hardly. Well, back to the open road, the poor gypsy. You ain't gonna be thinking that old peddler man no more, are ya? 'Course not. I never think of no one unless he's with me. Then I'm never gonna leave your side. Oh. Well, even if you don't, even if you never go away on a trip or nothin', couldn't you just once in a while give me one of them Persian goodbyes? Persian goodbyes? That ain't nothing compared to an Oklahoma hello. Hello, Will. Come on. Three cheers for the happy couple. Hip hip... Hooray! Hip hip... Hooray! Hip hip... Hooray! There you go with that healthy appetite, Curly, boy. Weren't you scared when the preacher said that about, "Do you take this here woman?" Well, I was scared. That he wouldn't say it. I was afraid Curly would back out on me. ♫ They couldn't pick a better time to start in life ♫ ♫ It ain't too early and it ain't too late ♫ ♫ Startin' as a farmer with a brand new wife ♫ ♫ Soon be living in a brand new state ♫ ♫ Brand new state ♫ ♫ Gonna treat you great ♫ ♫ Gonna give you barley ♫ ♫ Carrots and potatoes ♫ ♫ Pasture for the cattle ♫ ♫ Spinach and tomatoes ♫ ♫ Flowers on the prairie where the June bugs zoom ♫ ♫ Plenty of air and plenty of room ♫ ♫ Plenty of room to swing a rope ♫ ♫ Plenty of heart and plenty of hope ♫ ♫ Oklahoma when the wind comes sweeping down the plain ♫ ♫ And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet ♫ ♫ when the wind comes right behind the rain ♫ ♫ Oklahoma, every night my honey lamb and I ♫ ♫ sit alone and talk and watch a hawk ♫ ♫ makin' lazy circles in the sky ♫ ♫ We know we belong to the land ♫ ♫ and the land we belong to is grand ♫ ♫ that when we say ee-ow ♫ ♫ Ee-ow A-yip-i-o-ee-ay ♫ ♫ We're only sayin' you're doing fine, Oklahoma ♫ ♫ Oklahoma OK ♫ ♫ Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain ♫ ♫ Oklahoma, where the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet ♫ ♫ When the wind comes right behind the rain ♫ ♫ Oklahoma, every night my honey lamb and I ♫ ♫ Every night we sit alone and talk and watch a hawk ♫ ♫ Makin' lazy circles in the sky ♫ ♫ We know we belong to the land ♫ ♫ and the land we belong to is grand ♫ ♫ yipee-yay yipee-yay yipee-yay ♫ ♫ We say ee-ow ♫ ♫ A-yip-i-o-ee-ay ♫ ♫ We're only sayin' you're doing fine, Oklahoma! ♫ Oklahoma OK ♫ ♫ Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma ♫ ♫ We know we belong to the land ♫ ♫ and the land we belong to is grand ♫ ♫ And when we say ee-ow A-yip-i-o-ee-ay ♫ ♫ We're only sayin' you're doing fine, Oklahoma ♫ ♫ Oklahoma O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A ♫ ♫ Oklahoma ♫ Yeow! ♫ Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain ♫ ♫ Oklahoma, where the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet ♫ ♫ when the wind comes right behind the rain ♫ ♫ Oklahoma, every night my honey lamb and I ♫ ♫ Every night we sit alone and talk and watch a hawk ♫ ♫ makin' lazy circles in the sky ♫ ♫ Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma ♫ ♫ We know we belong to the land ♫ ♫ and the land we belong to is grand ♫ ♫ And when they say ee-ow A-yip-i-o-ee-ay ♫ ♫ We're only sayin' you're doing fine, Oklahoma ♫ ♫ Oklahoma OK ♫ ♫ O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A ♫ ♫ Oklahoma ♫ Yeow!

Oh, Ado Annie. Hello. Did you see my ring, girls? Is that gold? It looks fake. How long you been married? Four days. Yeah, four days with that laugh should count like a golden wedding. But if you married her you must've wanted to. Oh, sure, sure. No, no. I wanted to. I wanted to marry her when I saw the moonlight shining on the barrel of her father's shotgun. You know, I thought it would be better to be alive. And now I ain't so sure. I'll see you later. Thank you so much. From Persia? That's all the way from Persia. Hey there. Ali ain't gonna travel around the country no more. I decided he oughtta settle down in Bushyhead and run Papa's store. (Ado Annie) Hey, Will. Did you hear the news? Gertie married the peddler. Mighty glad to hear that, peddler man. Oh, thank you so much. I think I oughtta kiss the bride. Friend of the family, remember? Hey, Gertie. Have you ever had an Oklahoma hello? Uh-uh. Ow! Get off. What's the matter with him? Are you crazy? Come on! Help! Help! Where you goin'? I'm gonna stop Ado Annie from killing your wife. Mind your own business. Why, Andrew, why wasn't you back at the barn with us gettin' drunk? Never seen you stay so sober at a wedding party. I was scared all night, scared Jud would come back and start up on Curly. Jud Fry's been out of the territory for three weeks. He's back. Seen him at Claremore last night drunk as a lord. Shh. Come on. Come on. Come on down peaceable, Laurey, sugar. And you too, you curly-headed cowboy. With the dimple on your chin. What you doin' out there makin' all that racket? You bunch of pig stealers? Come on, everybody, let's get 'em down. Hey, where's the happy couple? Come on, Curly, get up there. Here's a baby girl for you. Here's a baby boy. Here's twins. (Man) We got you, Curly, boy. Weddin' party's still going on? Glad I ain't too late. I got a present for the groom. First I wanna kiss the bride. Laurey. Come on now, get off. Hey, Jud, get up. But I got a present for you. Come on, come on, now. Hey, hey. Leave it. What's going on? Get him, Curly. Come on, that's it, Curly. Come on. Hey. (Aunt Eller) Stand back now. Come on now. (Aunt Eller) Come on, now, Curly. Hey, hey, Curly. That ain't gonna stop him. You let him run. (Aunt Eller) Laurey, come up. Get him off. Come on, boys. That's it. Come on. Just settle down... Come on. No! Drop it now! Hey, look. What's the matter? Turn him over. Get away, some of you. Let me look at him. Hey, he all right? Fell on his own knife. What do we do? Curly, is he... Don't say anything. It can't be that way. I didn't... It can't be like that. I can't do anything now. Maybe get him to a doctor, but I don't know. Maybe someone could carry him over to my rig. I'll drive him to Dr. Tyler. I gotta go and see if there's something can be done for him.. Aunt Eller, please look after Laurey. Maybe it's better you and Curly don't go... No. All right, ready? One, two, three. Handle him easy. Don't shake him. Careful. I don't see why this had to happen when everything was so fine. Don't let your mind run on it. I won't ever forget it, I tell ya. Never will. That's all right, Laurey baby. You can't forget, just don't try to. Oh, lots of things happen to folks. Sickness or being poor and hungry. Being old and afeared to die. That's the way it is. Cradle to the grave. You can stand it. There's just one way. You gotta be hardy. You gotta be. You can't deserve the sweet and tender in life unless you're tough. I wished I was the way you were. Oh, fiddlesticks. Scrawny and old. Why, you couldn't hire me to be the way I am. What'd I do without you? You're such a crazy. Sure as you're borned. Laurey. What? We took Jud over to Dave Tyler's till the mornin'. Is he alive? No ma'am. Laurey, honey. Cord Elam, he's a federal marshal, you know. He thinks I oughtta give myself up tonight, he thinks. Tonight? Why, your train leaves Claremore in two hours. Best thing is for Curly to go his own accord and tell the judge. Well, you're the judge hereabouts, ain't ya, Andrew? Well, tell him now and get it over with. That wouldn't be proper. You have to do it in court. Oh, fiddlesticks. Let's do it here and say we did it in court. We can't do that. That's breakin' the law. Oh, well, let's not break the law. Let's just bend it a little. Come on, Andrew, Let's start the trial. We ain't got long. Aunt Eller, I ain't havin' that. Oh, come on, Cord, what's the matter with you? Andrew. Andrew. We can make it proper and do it legal. Andrew, I got to protest. Oh, shut your trap. We can give the boy a fair trial without lockin' him up on his weddin' night. So, here's the long and the short of it. Thank you, Eller. First, I gotta ask you what you plea. Huh? That means why'd you do it? Oh, why'd I do it? Well, 'cause he'd always been pesterin' Laurey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't let your tongue go wobbling around in your mouth like that. Now, listen to the question. What happened tonight that made you kill him? No, he come at me with a knife. And... And you had to defend yourself, didn't ya? Why, yes. And furthermore... Nevermind the furthermore. The plea is self defense. Self defense. We need a witness who saw this happen. I seen it. Slim. Cowman. He tried to stab him with a frog sticker. Fred. Cowman. Self defense, all right. Chalmers. Farmer. Now, I feel funny about this. Well, you'll feel funny when I tell your wife you're carrying on with another woman, won't you? I ain't carryin' on with no woman. Maybe not, but you'll sure feel funny when I tell your wife you are. Now, you can laugh all you like, but as federal marshal, I'll tell you now... Oh, shut up about being marshal. We ain't gonna let you send the boy to jail on his weddin' night. That's right. Now, we ain't gonna let ya. So shut up. That's right. Let's pull them to their train in Curly's surrey. Hold on. I ain't told the verdict yet. Well, the verdict's "not guilty," isn't it?
