Good evening, I'm Marci Feld. Thank you. Please! Please, stop it! Enough. It's enough. Tonight, the American Jewish Federation... You Jews, you wonderful Jews. Who needs Santa Claus? Am I right? Tonight, the AJF presents its highest honor its Global Humanitarian Award to the finest human being I have ever known. This award goes to my father, Mr. Ben Feld. We love you, bubby! Ben! We're here for you! Isn't he handsome? And kosher, right? Love you. Now, most of you may think of my father as, first and foremost an incredibly successful corporate legend but he has always taught me about responsibility and giving something back. He would say, "Sweetheart, you are the prettiest, the smartest the most perfect girl in the whole world so you must reach out to all of those who aren't." Powerful. Doesn't Marci look fabulous? Ultra-Marci. Mega-Marci. The full Marci. Ten years ago, we opened our first shelter for the homeless helping those in need of a bed, counseling and shampoo and conditioner. Next came a drug rehab program called "Marci Cares" and today, there are 25 branches of Marci Cares all across the tri-state area. Can you imagine being addicted to heroin? It's heartbreaking. But does the weight stay off? I only wish that my mother, Sheila could be with us on this joyous occasion. But, as some of you know, six years ago while we were opening a free clinic in Johannesburg she was tragically killed by a savage South African leopard. It is in her memory that I would now like to present this medal of mercy a medal from Marci. Tonight, this award goes to my father, Mr. Ben Feld! We have problems, sir. Daddy? Daddy, where are you going? Was it the entrée? Daddy... Daddy... - What's going on? - Marci, incoming. This way, Miss Feld. Daddy, what is wrong? I... Sweetheart, sit. The corporate crisis centering on Ben Feld has begun to escalate out of control. I got here as fast as I could. Daddy, what is this? - Feld's massive corporate holdings - Daddy's busy. include the notorious urban record label called Felony Assault. Earlier today, that label released a new CD by controversial gangsta rap star Dr. S. Dr. S has been a hardcore success - for the past decade. - I don't know this person. - His songs are known - He's a rapper. for their extreme sexual and often violent content. His latest release, however, is by far his most provocative. Controversy is erupting protesters are converging on Feldco headquarters in Manhattan. - An angry mob is calling for blood - Shame! - specifically - Shame! - the blood of mogul Ben Feld - Shame! - Daddy, is that your picture? - who's been honored tonight - as a great humanitarian. - Shame! - I am here with senator - Shame! and leading media watchdog Mary Ellen Spinkle. - Oh, no. - Yeah! I am appalled. Is she wearing a helmet? I am outraged. I am so disgusted that I can barely speak but I will. Oh, my God! This recording is unspeakably offensive not just to all Americans, but to all human beings everywhere. I will not quote the lyrics because, as a Christian I cannot even pronounce some of the words. But let me just read you some of the song titles "Shoot the Teacher." Oh, my... - Yes! - Not good. "I Am the King of Your Mouth." Very nice. "You My Special Bitch." Wait. "I Love You Because I'm High." "Six Grades Are Plenty." Lane, did you ask Legal? Do I really own this label? You bought it years ago as part of a package. "It Ain't My Baby Because I Don't Like You." - This is it. - And "The Power in my Pants." Has Dr. S gone too far? I don't blame these rappers I blame the man who profits from this perversion! I blame the man who makes his dirty millions from the wholesale slaughter of our children's innocence! I blame an American Satan, Ben Feld! I am calling for a complete boycott of all Feldco products including movies, newspapers, TV shows, and DVDs! A boycott? Are you listening to this, Mr. Feld? Or I should say "Mr. Filth." Ben Feld, you are a dead man! - Ben? - Ben? - Daddy! - Ben, don't die! The moral firestorm blazing around Ben Feld has raged into a white-hot economic inferno. A what? Pickets have closed record stores nationwide. - My God... I'm choking... - We have contacted Tubby Fenders the president of Felony Assault, who is currently serving time - in a penitentiary. - Look... - Yo. - Mr. Fenders, what about Dr. S? Dr. S would never apologize! He would never bow down to the white man's censorship! Just like me, he has been unjustly oppressed and accused! Tubby Fenders, the president of Felony Assault Records. Give me that remote! Big baby! I can't believe this. Everything I worked for my whole life it's all going to crumble. Baby, I'm so sorry. - Daddy! - Because you have to see all this. Because I... I just wish I had a son. Why would you want a son? Someone to take over, to take charge, so that you wouldn't have to worry. Someone we could trust. Oh, my God. In just two weeks, we are going to put Ben Feld on trial before the entire civilized world and China... That's it! I'm out of here! - What? - Dr. Skellar! I need Dr. Skellar! - Daddy! Look what's happening. - Dr. Skellar! No! I can't stay here! - You get back in that bed, - I'm not gonna... - Your Highness. - I need a phone. - You don't need a phone to calm... - Mr. Feld. Mr. Feld, you are an extremely sick man. Now, no visitors, and nurse, get rid of that television and I need ten cc's of Valium right now. - Thank you. - For your father. - Ben... - What? I'm going to put you in complete isolation for two weeks for your own good. No cell phones, no faxes, no Internet, nothing. Like the '80s? I'm warning you, Ben. If you have any more stress, it could kill you. Sweetheart, please, just go. You don't think the rules apply to you, do you? Ben, you're in real danger. You're a very sick man. Thank God you're rich. You're here in this hospital and you're going to stay here until I release you. - Sorry. - Excuse me. - Marce! - Marci! - Marci, I can't believe it! - Are you all right? Is your dad okay? - Have you bathed? - Look, chocolates! - Did you get a chance to bathe yet? - They're for you... and your dad. But I feel so useless. I love my father so much and I can't even help him. And he doesn't really want me to try. Why not? He said he wished he had a son. Maybe he's right. Maybe I'm not strong enough or smart enough. Maybe I am just a socialite. Excuse me? Just a socialite? You serve on the boards of three major museums. You are a guest editor at Vogue, Vanity Fair, and Mademoiselle. And last year alone, you raised over seven figures for literacy, muscular dystrophy and cancer. In this town, you are cancer. No, but this involves law suits and spin control and the whole worldwide entertainment industry. Which is your life. You introduced Princess Diana to Mother Teresa at your bat mitzvah. They had cake. - Not Diana. - Time Magazine has declared you the most charming white woman in America under fifty. Except we're talking about rap. And, you know, the inner cities and censorship and the cultural legacy of black people. - I happen to adore black people. - Word. - Word up. - Word perfect. You can get anybody to do anything you want. It's your gift. Yeah, and my dad is being isolated. But I've only got two weeks until the hearings. So get out there... And show your father just what you're capable of. You say, "Watch out, America, here comes Marci." Yeah, I'm going to go see that Dr. S, in person, on his own turf. I'll explain everything and we can work together. - Marci cares. - Marci loves. Marci saves her father's life. So where is this Dr. S? - Uptown. - Uptown. All the way.

And I'm an African princess strolling along the Nile with my handmaidens. Our princess is proud. But lonely. She fears she will never find her perfect rainbow soul mate. We dance the tragic despair of the unmarried princess. - What was in that weed? - That's what I'm sayin'. The tribal drummer feels our pain. And his ancient rhythms fill our souls. To lift our spirits, we sing our favorite tribal chant. The words mean, "Maybe I should become a lesbian." Suddenly, one of the handmaidens breaks away. She runs across the fields discovering freedom and joy and her own personal creativity. That one's craziness is catchy, right there. Handmaiden... - All right, chill, handmaiden. - Calm down, dear. The princess... Back... - Sorry. - Yeah. wonders if she will be alone forever. Then late one night, a noble prince arrives from the village far away. No. Don't push me. A village called Harvard Law School. He is handsome and regal. Hello, ladies. Do I know you? Kenya. There is a gathering with music and movement. Your Highness.

Women do not have to fight each other over a man! Not without mud, y'all. Stop it! Stop kicking me! Okay, ladies, just stop it, okay? Y'all calm down otherwise somebody's blouse might get pulled open. I'm warning you I know Tae-Bo. Tae-Bo? I could kill you while I sculpt and tone my midsection. Tae-Bo!

Last night, out-of-control heiress Marci Feld was arrested in an exclusive uptown nightspot where she allegedly fired 18 rounds of live ammunition into a crowd of innocent bystanders. How will this rampage affect Marci's father, Ben Feld who remains hospitalized? Is Marci now the gangster gal of notorious rap demon Dr. S? All across America, outraged citizens are asking "Has Marci gone mad?" - Marci Feld? - Yes. Get movin'. Somebody posted bail. Who? I told them, no one is allowed to call my father. You'll never guess. You? You posted my bail? How 'bout "thank you"? "Thank you, Dr. S." "Thank you"? Yeah, thanks to you, this happened to me. Look at my shoe. And this gown was new, you know. My skin... I had to give my moisturizer to this huge transvestite with a razor blade. You smell like fuzz. Thank you for the information. Oh my God! No! This could ruin everything! - God. - I look beautiful. - Please put the paper down. - I got you covered. Why? Why did I think I could fix everything? Because you're daddy's spoiled little girl... that's why. You know, I spent all night with these women in that cell. Hookers and pickpockets, drug dealers. I thought I was so superior and just now I'm realizing they have a skill. They can take care of themselves. I mean, yeah, they're all criminals, but they know who they are. Who am I? I'm nothing. Oh, God. Look, you know what you are? You're a baller. I am? A bo'n thug. Me? I don't even know what that is. When you were dancing in that club... you was kind of loose. Kind of bangin'. I banged? You was down. How low? When you was doing all that Tae-Bo shit waving that gun around... Yeah. That was kind of hot. - That was some sexy shit. - Yeah. You was illin'. I was da bomb. You were da shit. I was the big smelly turd. Is that one? Give me this. Come on, get in the car. Why? Because it's a limo. All right. - Got some right there. - Thank you. Well... don't. Where are we going? To my crib. We can't do this. - Okay. I'll take you home. - Okay. But first can I ask you a question? When black people make love, is it different? From white folks? Yeah. How? It's good. No. Wait. But first, you have to tell me one thing. What is your real name? Can I trust you? Yes. Kelvin. Kelvin Drell. I like that. It's real. Wait. Now you got to tell me something. Something you've never told anyone else. Like what? - Your weight. - No. No, that... I couldn't do that. No, that's too intimate. No, I'm saving that for my wedding night. Trust me. You'll feel better. Why should I tell you, of all people? Because I don't care. Kelvin. Dr. S's posse is so hot. It turns out Freekazoid went to Harvard Business School with my brother! T-Ville is going to open his own restaurant. - Quantrelle isn't just a lawyer. - He isn't? He's a new form of Pilates. Marci spent the whole night in jail. - She did? - With Martha Stewart. Okay... Okay! That's great. Almost a quarter mile. I'm exhausted. Hi! - The club! - Yolanda! - Jail! - How are you? You know how just forever I've been going out with one guy after another and it's never really worked out? Like that gorgeous investment banker. - And the senator. - And Bill Gates. And you know how they're all great but none of them ever quite measured up to this dream I had of the perfect man? Someone incredibly successful. And incredibly sexy. And incredibly strong. Last night, I found him. He found me. - Oh, my God! - This is so beautiful. Marce! There's just one day to go before the MTV Music Awards and the story the world can't stop talking about is the rumored romance between Dr. S and Marci Feld. What's going on between the princess and the player? Is it the real thing? Mary Hart. Man, she don't write back. Nah... Well well... - My man! - My brother! - Dawg! - Cat! - S! - T! - Yo! - Bro! 'Sup? You wanted to see me? Yeah, I wanted to know all those years ago in the projects, who found you? - Who? - Who? You was living next-door. You were hungry. You broke in. But who gave you the beats? Who taught you to bounce? Who made the first tape? - Yeah. - Who duped the demo? - Who? Who did it? - That's right. We did it together, we started the label and you kept getting busted, and I kept you on board. But who believed? That's right, Tubby! Right! Tubby... What's up? What's going down? You, my brother, and I'm saying that because I love you. I love you, too, dawg. And you're wack. What? I tried to help you. I sent Yolanda out to get your attention. You passed on by, you passed on over, you passed on out. Sure did. What are you talking about? Watch. Today we dealing with Dr. S, with a special BET jam which I'm calling, "He Real?" So what do you think of Dr. S? Is he real? I don't know, man, he used to be a bad-ass baller but now, what up? He's supposed to be with Yolanda. He ain't down; he ain't real he ain't even Dr. S, not no more. Man, he Dr. Seuss. Those are just kids talking. They're consumers. - Buy your records! - Right. Pay the bills! Yes. Dr. S? I used to love him. When I was doing it with my last boyfriend I would put Dr. S's head on him. But not now. I hate him. What, did he run out of black women? There's none left? She don't know what's going on. So with you and that Marci bitch for the whole last week what's really been going down, dawg? Yeah, talk to us, S. We just like spending time together, having a meal. Last night we rented DVDs. So what? Which ones? They were kind of fabulous. I mean, we saw, Sleepless in Seattle, City of Angels You've Got Mail, stuff like that. Meg Ryan? Shit! Not just Meg Ryan, nah, man. I mean, we did some hardcore inner-city shit, too. - All right. - Like this one where this chick teaches these little ghetto kids how to play violins. Meryl Streep? Damn! This is like some sci-fi shit. What? You're turning into a Jewish chick. Mazel tov. Son, you got to choose: the bitch or the brothers! - That's right. - 'Sup? What's it gonna be? The MTV Awards are tomorrow night and everyone wants to know. Dr. S, will he apologize? Should he? To get some answers, we're here outside the Eastside home of heiress Marci Feld. Here she comes right now! - Marci! - Marci! - Hi, Marci. - Hi. Marci, what are you planning to say to Congress next week? Marci, what are you planning to testify? Okay, one at a time, though. You, yes. Marci, how's your dad? Better and better. Don't you just love him? - What about Dr. S? - Who? - Are you really involved? - What about Yolanda? What about Congress? Okay, I will tell you this. Everyone should really watch the MTV Awards tomorrow night because you are going to see a whole new Dr. S. He's really not about sex and violence, not anymore. He's all about love. Yesterday, we rented Kate and Leopold. Global Premiere Video. I'm a woman of color Color me blue Because I fell in love With an asshole like you I hate you, bitch Marci Look at you! Who's my daddy? I really shouldn't allow this, but remember, it's just for tonight and after the show I want him right back here in his bed. Okay. But the MTV Awards? Daddy... last week you told me that you wished you had a son. I was upset. I was crazy. I never should have said that. It's okay. You were right. You need someone that people respect. Someone real. Daddy, tonight I think you're going to see that finally, after all these years, just maybe... I can be that person. Of course you can, baby. And there's someone I want you to meet. Someone who has made all the difference. Daddy, he is so wonderful. Who? Bring your medication. Dr. S! We're here live at the MTV Awards and the question on everyone's mind is Dr. S, will he apologize? Is he over, or is he just getting started? Senator Spinkle. If Dr. S has not completely changed his so-called music tonight will be the end of him and Ben Feld. We will crush them. Really, Senator? But I don't want people to think I'm some right-wing ogre. I enjoy contemporary sounds, and so does my son Chip. So, Chip, who are your favorites? He loves that Mariah Carey and Cher and... What is that group that you like so much? Boyz R Us. Thank you, Chip. Thank you, Senator. Thank you very much. - This place is packed. - Yeah, isn't it great? It's really full. - Excuse me. What happened? - You okay? You look good. I love this hat. It's not too much? No. Not too much. - Now, ladies and gentlemen, - Okay. and MTV viewers worldwide it's the moment we've all been waiting for. Please welcome, please give it up for Let's Make Some Nasty with Dr. S and the NNPP! Yo, what's up? Yo, live global interface, what's up? People everywhere, what's going on? Everybody's waiting. Everybody's wondering, what's he gonna say? There's been a lot of controversy surrounding my music my mind, my action. Folks been saying stuff like, "Is he righteous? Is he real?" So I decided to make a statement. This ain't about Congress. Ain't about Ben Feld. It's about a very special lady. This lady got it going on. I mean, she make a plan, and she makes it happen. She's something else. This is a whole other level of lady... and she's really made an impression on me. Because this lady likes to play doctor. Baby, I'm thinking of you Want to show you how much I love you I'm so into you, a little kiss won't do So you gotta let me love you, baby, through and through - So sweet. - I already touched your face Isn't he something? This is the guy. Oh, honey. You're the one for me Let me tell you where my love should be In the butt, let me love you in the butt Baby, to prove my love in sincere Let me deliver it in the rear In the butt, from behind Forget fast forward, push rewind Girl, I did that sizzlin' strut Take it, in the butt Down she goes! Who's the boss? Where the sun don't shine Take it, in the butt - Take it, in the butt - Daddy. Okay, go. Take it, in the butt - Take it, in the butt! - In the butt! I love it. Flush Ben Feld! For the past 24 hours, Feldco has once again been making headlines all over the world. The troubled corporation is now near complete bankruptcy and Ben Feld remains hospitalized. I'm speaking with concerned parents. Flush Ben Feld! In The Butt, your reaction? That man is the devil! Please join me in wearing this brown ribbon of protest when the hearings begin tomorrow. Let us send our message to Dr. S and the Feld family filth machine! Stop the music! Wipe it clean! - Boycott Feldco! - Excuse me, ma'am? I'm no one. I'm just visiting. I'm not camera-ready. I'm not camera... Okay. Bye-bye. Bye. Marce? Sweetie. Marce, it's Kirsten. It's time for some sunshine. And some Prozac. Look, honey. Look. And I just had to come over just to tell you... Everyone hates you. I know. Knock-knock. The butler let me in. It's awful. It's shocking. How can you bear it? All those people. What about the pickets and the reporters? - Are they still out there? - All the networks. - Plus CNN. - And Stone Phillips. He's cute. He called you a whore. So how's your father? The doctor said it was just stress not another heart attack, but you never know. Marce, first you lose your mom. And now you kill your dad. Is she all right? No. No, I haven't bathed, I haven't slept. Have you eaten anything? I can't. I'm too upset. - Good girl! - That's a good thing. So, what about that Dr. S? - How could he do this? - How could he sing that song? Marce, did you ever let Dr. S... Never. What about you and T-Bill? In his dreams. What about you and Freekazoid? Not in this lifetime. What about you and Quantrelle? It was his birthday. Here. The committee is now in session. Please be seated. Will you please state your names? Marci Michelle Jennifer Rebecca Feld. - No. - Yes. Dr. S. And the "S" is for? Snatchcatcher. And is that your given legal name? - No. - And that would be? Horndog Tittyman Pussyhound Snatchcatcher. I see. And this is precisely why this committee must take aggressive action against Feldco and its hip-hop criminals especially as a result of this week's MTV Awards program. Because on that night, Dr. S told the entire world that America is the land of the foul and the home of the butt. Isn't that the case? No. Senator Spinkle members of the committee and everyone, no. No, what happened that night... This whole mess would... Please just don't blame my father, okay? Just don't... and don't even blame this person. If you want to blame someone, blame me. You? Yes, I put myself in charge of this whole situation, and I just, of course, made things so much worse because I thought that I could just save my father and Felony Assault and the whole world. I don't know. I just thought that I was so right and so real and just this morning I put on five pounds from the vending machines in the lobby. I... Senator Spinky... - Spinkle. - Yeah. This whole deal with you and with these hearings and with my song it's been one big, complete misunderstanding. What? A misunderstanding? Really? I'm sorry, but I believe that your message has been, in fact, far too clear. No. Just like the history of the proud black people once again, we've been misunderstood. We've been accused and oppressed. Ain't that right? What are you talking about? So I... Miss Feld and I... are gonna educate y'all. We are? Please do. As African-Americans, we got us a proud oral tradition. That's right, mama. Proud. We've even got our own language. Ain't that right? I said, ain't that right? Yes. Yo! See, and this is a language that white folks just ain't, like, down with. They don't get it. Ya dig? No, they don't. They don't. As in, for example, maybe, when "bad" means "good." Or "illin'." It means "happening." Who knew? And like "phat." That's a black word but in white English, it would probably mean... "Just swell." You phat. Thank you, motherfucker. Which means "my dear friend." - Right on. - Peachy. See, we can connect. Can I get an "amen"? Brothers and sisters? Amen. Hallelujah. So, like the joint I was dropping at the awards show I say, "Let me love you in the butt." That's all. You see what I'm saying? No! We do not know what you're saying. Just hear him out. Don't be crack. - Wack. - Wack. See, in the hood, "in the butt" that don't mean like no sex thing. No. Please. No. Hell, no. No, it means, I would imagine something entirely and completely different... in the rich, vivid dialect of a disenfranchised people a people we once enslaved. You know, my mama was a slave? At Wendy's. So, Dr. S, we're all eager to hear, then in that poetic, triumphant language just what does the phrase mean? It means, "Let me love you with respect." "Let me love you in a very special way." "Let me love you forever." It's really so beautiful. Know what I'm saying? You dig? No, I don't dig. Two days ago, controversial rap star Dr. S told a Congressional committee that in his song, In The Butt the title phrase actually means, "with love and respect." Is this just a desperate ploy to save his career and the future of Feldco lndustries? Or has the slang remark actually begun to take hold? Is Dr. S becoming the new American hero? All across America, the cultural crossfire has begun. We are gonna hang him high! A national survey shows strong youth support for Dr. S. Please. These polls are pure media distortion. I am here to protect and defend the American people not to listen to them. Dr. S, you are doomed. You heard her: We're doomed. Finished. Senator Spinkle is so powerful, so determined. But In the Butt is going triple platinum. I bought five copies as gifts. Plus, we're making all this money. It's the biggest selling single in the history of the label. Celine Dion wants to do a remix, as a duet. But this isn't about money anymore. Right? Isn't it about freedom of speech? Yes. - Yes. - You're right. For sure. You're gonna have to take the single and the CD off the shelves. That's what Senator Spinkle is demanding. You now what she needs. Botox. Everywhere. But that isn't going to change her mind. What else can we do? You know, the ladies are right. - We are? - What are you thinking? No. We can't. It'll be wrong, it would be low. It would be the title of my next CD. Which is? Play dirty. I've got it! For your mama. Who was that? It's after midnight. Delivery. Mom, are you still working? Sweetheart, the hearings end tomorrow. I have to prepare my decision. It's from Dr. S. The note says he made it just for you. Please. Put that down. And wash your hands. But, Mom, everyone loves Dr. S. That's not true. There are millions more just like me. It's called Utah. Will you at least listen to it... for me? Yes. Now, go to bed. And no Boyz R Us. Senator Spinkle I know that we've had our differences but I've been thinking about me and you and I know you're up for re-election. So maybe there's something I can do. I promised Chip. Vote for Spinkle Yeah, you heard that right Vote for Spinkle I seen the light Vote for Spinkle That's what I'd do - Vote for Spinkle, yeah - Who does he think he is? I am a United States senator. Mary Ellen That's what I'm sellin' That's what I'm yellin' Soon you'll be jellin' Come on, Senator Spinky You're on the brinky Don't need no shrinky You make me kinky Don't you touch it Vote for Spinkle 'Cause she's the one Vote for Spinkle And keep your gun Vote for Spinkle 'Cause she's pro-life Vote for Spinkle But don't tell your wife Thank you Thank you Twinkle, twinkle, little Spinkle You're in the pink, so just unwrinkle Come on, you're the one Yeah, you make me hum So watch out, White House 'Cause here she comes Vote for Spinkle That's one fine bitch - Vote for Spinkle - If you vote for Spinkle She'll help the rich Vote for Spinkle - My sister, my brother - Wow! - Vote for Spinkle - Just vote for Spinkle 'Cause she's a mutha So, you have requested a private meeting before I announce my findings. And I assume that you are hoping for that you've come begging for some sort of plea bargain. - She's psychic. - She knows. I'm sorry, but it is far too late for apologies or special favors. Dr. S, it is time to take your medicine. I know. My music can infect anyone. Can you imagine the damage one of my beats could perpetrate if it got into the wrong booty? What would happen to the country, our families, these hearings? If even a senator wasn't safe. Who are you talking about, Mrs. Clinton? I mean what if the American people, on every network, in prime time was exposed to a Spinkle shaking her thing to a Dr. S song? But that's impossible. That's entertainment. Where did you get that? Chip! You were taping me? You're just like your father. It's for your own good. I love you, Mom. In the butt. After deep and sincere deliberations the committee and I have come to a decision regarding Mr. Feld, Dr. S and his music and we have determined that not only is this CD not harmful in any way it is, in fact... the most important cultural document since the Declaration of Independence. And it is every American's duty to purchase as many copies as possible. And do not download or borrow or burn. Buy. Buy. Miss Feld. Thank you. I would just like to say how proud and grateful I am we all are, as citizens. And I know that my father and Dr. S join me in saluting this decision in the name of justice, freedom, and the American way of life. In fact, these two men these selfless, unbelievably generous, all-American citizens have also decided to donate 100% of their profits from this recording to the United Negro College Fund. How about that! Isn't that something? Good for you! Good for you! And on this occasion, President Bush himself has asked that Dr. S address the nation. - What? - Yes. Who? The president? I want to talk about being real. Because whatever you do and whoever you are you've got to be real. The problem is who decides who's real and not. And I say there's only one way to find out. What? And remember you are both still under oath. All right, she's real. There was a time I had no drive I breathed, but barely was alive But fate changed what my life's about Whoever thought that I would shout I've got a job, it's like a dream High fashion gives me self-esteem So shop hip-hop, it all connects I call my label Marci X I'm real, I'm down, I'm total sex I made parole in Marci X Once they called her Stinky Spinkle But in this look, she starts to twinkle I'm real, I'm down, so clear the decks I'm far right on in Marci X Hey, Marce We're glad 'Cause we love your collection It's bad I never judge, I don't condemn - He's oh-so-butch - He's kind of femme We just had sex with Eminem Yo Marce My father now is feeling great I dressed him for a special date I'm down, I'm real, but hold the phone You've got the Doc, but I'm alone I've made a match, I think they meld Meet my new stepmom, Yolanda Feld I'm a woman of color, I make him twitch Te amo, Ben, so color me rich I fly by my couture du jour It's de rigueur for him and her It fades, it balls, it's total sex - You'll catch your match - In Marci X Who's real, who's bad, who's hittin' da butt? - Who says, "Now stop it" - Then shut up Who's real, who's bad, who is da bomb? I must confess, she was a mess Not more, just less, since she met the S The doctor shocked her, the doctor mocked her The doctor rocked her, then he wed-locked her Who's real, who's down, check out the dress Don't hide the bride, it's Marci X Don't mess with my music.
