* And when the medicine ran out * And when we didn't speak for days. What about your parents? They're not gonna be home for hours. * Bang * Do you wanna play * Bang * Blow you away * You'll by my toy * To seduce and destroy * You'll be my toy * To seduce and destroy * Open wide Shit, Dad! You fagots! How could you betray us like this? Get out! Dad, stop. Dad, stop, please. Dad, stop. Hey, buddy. Whoa, are you okay? Do you want me to call someone? Well, at least come to my car, I've got water and food. Come on. How you feelin'? Got anywhere to go? No. Well I'm moving into my new place in Halifax Canada. Me and my girlfriend are opening up a tattoo parlor. I could do with a roommate for a few months. You know, someone to help out around the parlor, if you're interested, it looks like you could do with a roof over your head, some food, and a shower. Thank you. You're most welcome. Oh, I'm Elijah, by the way. I'm Jay. Hey, Noah. I don't want you to go. I don't wanna go either but I guess when Mom died she didn't expect your dad to kick me out and ship me off to live with my real one in Canada, eh? Everything about this sucks. What am I gonna do without you here? It's all right, you know, I turn 18 next year. I can always come back. Well you better. It's gonna be weird not having you here. Give me your arm. - But Mom gave you that watch. - I'm giving it to you. Mom gave me this watch to stop me coming home late from school. I want you to have it. Thanks, Josh. I'll see you later, little bro. I'll text you every day. Be back before you know it, alright? So that's the science lab. To the left, gymnasium. That is the drama studio. At the end of the hall here is languages. Which, because you're on probation for the next two weeks, every single day before class, you will register with Mr. Harris. Good morning, student council, and welcome back from summer break. You all excited to be back? Yeah. Me neither. Now look, this is your final year. So just be happy that it'll all be over soon. And this year's gonna be very exciting. I hope you're all looking forward to it as much as I am. Principal Wyatt, how can I help you? Mr. Harris, I'm just bringing you your new student. He's joining us for the last year. Great. Well um, this is Kaitlyn. The head of the student council. Dwayne, Sidney and Zac. Uh, why don't we get you to take a seat at the front there. Thanks, Principal. I'll let you know how it all goes. Awesome, thank you. Kids, welcome back. Now, I have your time schedules for today. Kaitlyn. Sidney. And Zac. Um, Joshua.

Way to set women back 50 years. * I've had my ups and downs * This is my next chapter now * It's my time to shine, it's not who am I * It's where I am now * I'll make it to the end * Let's not pretend we like one another * Just to get on with each other * I'm just passing by * Next chapter Hey. You know this is gonna cost you a fortune, right? I don't care, Dad's paying the phone bill. So how's it going out there? How's school, how's your real dad? School's shitty, he sucks, so yeah. Pretty great. How are you holding up? I'm sure it'll get better while you're out there. Yeah, I'm good. Well, as good as I can be, I guess. Just kinda feel like the whole family's split up and fallen apart. Dad doesn't talk about Mom, either. And it's taken down all the photos of her around the house. It's like he's trying to act like she never even existed. Hang in there, buddy. People deal with grief in different ways. Are you dealing with it okay? Yeah, I mean, I'm good. I'm good, I'm cool. Great, actually um, I'm fine. But um, I'll tell you what mate, I'm gonna get off the phone, before your dad goes mental but I'll give you a call back a little bit later and we'll catch up properly, okay? Okay. I'm glad you're all right. I'm here for you, no matter what it's about. You know that, right? Yeah, buddy, you too. I'll see you soon, okay? Bye. Bye. * Next chapter, next chapter. Hey. Hold up, England. What's the rush? Do you mind? You know, actually, yeah. I do. Why'd you take a girl's cooking class? You gonna start sewing, too? Hey. We don't appreciate fagots around here. So you best watch yourself. Okay? Kaitlyn. No phones in class. People are talking about you. Mm-hm. Why are you even in here? Well, Katie... It's Kaitlyn. I don't care. Me taking this class is a point. You? Pointless. And why is that? Because unlike you, I'll use my grades to go on and pursue a career, you however will just stay here being the dirty little slut you are who can't manage to keep her nose out of other people's business. * I should have said this * I should have said that and I * I regret this, oh oh oh * I regret that 'cause I. Hey! Queer boy. Hey! Fuck off, assholes. We're doing a public service, man. Guy's a fagot. You okay? Yeah, I think. Let's go inside and get you cleaned up. Just sit down right there. - All okay? - Yeah yeah, he's fine. Um, Elijah, is he old enough? Well, I figure we'll make some extra money in youngsters? Elijah, you'll get us shut down. I'm kidding, babe. Jay just saved him from a fight outside. You poor thing, are you all right? I'll live. Okay, I found the first aid kit. Thank you. Can I see your neck? Well uh, Rosalie, I think we should leave these two boys to it and go grab a drink. Great, I've some new herbal teas I really want you to try. Hooray. They're funny. Yeah, they're really good people and great company, too. I can't see if I'm getting all of it, there's more light in my studio parlor if you wanna go back there. Sure. So what's your name, stranger? Joshua. Nice to meet you, I'm Jay. I'm guessing you're from England, right? Yeah. So you've been to that big clock that you guys have? Big Ben? Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I have. Are you from Texas? The accent, I know. But I'm actually from Alabama. I think that's all I can get, you might wanna shower though. Oh, hey. Hi, um, Jay said I could use his shower? Oh, there's an en-suite just through there. Thank you. Hey, why didn't you take a shower? Um, I kind of walked in on your friend Elijah taking a shower. Oh my god, that's too funny. Did he see you? I don't think so but don't tell him. I won't, I promise. That is too funny, I'm sorry. I guess I'll just have to go home with this now. Um, well if you wanna come back to my place and shower, I'm okay with that, I'm not a psycho or anything. It's not that far away. Um, are you sure? I don't wanna be a burden or anything. No, I just finished up here so, we can head out. Okay. Interesting car. Yeah, it's Rosalie's, spent all my money on my apartment so I borrow it from time to time. Watch your step. This is it. - This is what? - Sam. What? I didn't know he was having company over. I'm Sam. His roommate. Nice to meet you, I'm Joshua. That's enough, Sam, go put some clothes on. I'm going out in a minute, anyway. I'm sorry about that, it's Rosalie's step-brother and they're both really crazy. That's cool, he seems colorful. You don't even know the half of it. Come on. This is amazing. Thanks. Did you do this? I did, yeah. It's incredible. You're just being nice now. No, I'm serious. I've always wanted to be an artist, so thank you. I'm impressed. You're really talented. No, I... I, I, I'm being a terrible host. I didn't even take your bag, I'm sorry. Oh. May I offer you something to drink? - Sure. - What would you like? - Surprise me. - Okay. You know it's cold outside, right? Yeah, but I'm not gonna attract any chicks dressed like an Eskimo. All right, then. See you later, Jay. - Nice meeting you, Joshua. - You too. Here you go. Thank you. This is really nice. Thanks. Felt the walls looked a little boring when I moved in, so this happened, I know it's silly, but... No no, it's not, it's nice, I like it. Uh, the showers are back there if you still wanna go. I almost forgot, um cool, I won't be long. Take as long as you like. I'm gonna step outside and have a cigarette. Okay. Hello, Jay. Hey, Mrs. Tremblay. Oh, mama mia. Fuck. Hey, Josh. All good? Yeah, cheers for that. Is it alright if I use your washing machine? Oh yeah, go ahead. Are you okay? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Look, a bear! There's no... I am so sorry. I'm extremely embarrassed right now. It's okay. To be honest, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. You're just trying to save my pride now. No really, I um, I thought it was kind of funny. And I took the whole thing as a compliment. * Don't ever change * Don't, don't ever change your way * Don't ever change * Don't, don't ever change your way * You got my heart fluttering like a butterfly Shit. Go and answer it. Thank you. Do you fancy a pizza? Would it be mean if I said I had no money to help pay for it? Nah, don't worry about it. I hear most British people are mean, so. That's because we are. Well, the way I see it, your clothes have about an hour left. What are you suggesting? Why don't you be the subject for my next art piece? What do I have to do? Oh, nothin', just stand there while I take a picture. And you might have to shower after. Okay, are you ready? Ready. Any good? They're awesome. Would you like to see them? Sure. Oh, cool. Come here for a second. What are we doing? Let's see your hand. Alright, put it about right there. Good job. No, no. No. No, bad Jay. Sit down. Stay! No. Oh my god. I'm gonna need a hug for that one. No, that's not gonna happen. - Give me a hug. - No. - Hug. - Back off. Bring it in. Fuck. Thank you. I'm stuffed. Me too. So what are you doing here? Didn't you invite me? No, I mean why are you in Canada? Oh. It's okay, you don't have to tell me. No no, it's fine, it's just, it's not for any happy reason. My mom died back in England and I was shipped out here to live with my dad. I'm so sorry to hear that. It's okay. What about your parents? I, I just moved out and that's it. But we don't really have to talk about that. Okay, artistic question. What's your favorite color? Wow, that is real personal information. I'm better off giving you my bank details. It's blue. What? No way. What's wrong with blue? That's plain and boring. Is that why you covered me in blue paint, because I'm plain and boring? I promise that was not my intention. Alright, then. What's your favorite color? Probably blue. - But you just said... - I'm kidding, calm down. I got you, though. My favorite color would have to be green. Why green? It's just, it's really neutral and peaceful. Almost everything green represents is either positive or natural, so, hey it just works. Well I guess that beats plain and boring. Hey. What kind of girl do you think I am? Wait, no no no no. He's an artist. Wait, that came out wrong. You guys suck. She was gymnast. Good morning. Hey. Aw, you made me tea. That's right, isn't it? All British people love their tea. They really do. Surprising no one here has a kettle. I have the screaming pot thing, if that's what you mean. What, is that not right? Hey, were you guys in the shower last night? It's like someone smashed a p-siren in there. I have no idea what you're talking about. Maybe it was the gymnast. Oh, that's right. You're a jerk. So, I had a really great time with you last night. I did, too. So, when do I get to see you again? Well, I have an art show tonight and I would love it if you'd be there with me. That's exciting. Well um, I finish school at three so uh, I'll see you here soon after? I'll see you then. Okay. Somebody's happy. So this because of that boy yesterday? You didn't. Aw, that's great, man! It's good to see you finally getting close to someone. Thanks, bro. You know, I had no idea you were into guys. Really? Even after I photographed your boyfriend in his tighty whities? What did he just say? - Hey. - Hey. And now you're coming with me. Bye, guys. Don't you look good in a shirt. Well, I would. Figure out this damn tie. Stop, let me do it. Thanks. It's all right. Back in England my mom used to send me and my little brother to these super posh secondary schools and the only thing wrong with it really was the uniforms. I mean the ties were practically made out of cardboard so you needed some severe skill just to be able to do them up. Well, I blame Alabama public education for my lack of knowing. Okay, that should do it. So are you excited for tonight? I'm so nervous. Don't be, it's gonna be awesome. Guys, the map thingy says it's just up here. Oh, I'm just gonna have a fag first. Excuse me? Oh my god, it means cigarette in England. Okay, that's weird but um, cool, I guess. We'll see you inside? I really don't wanna leave you out here alone, though. No it's cool, I'll keep him company. You two go on. Okay, we'll see you all inside. Could I grab one of those? Sure. Thanks man, Rosalie don't know I smoke so uh, keep it quiet for me, will ya? No problem. - Cheers. - Thanks. I think Jay really likes you. Really? So like, how do you know Jay? Well, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, I'm just gonna tell you the truth. I think it's important for you to know so you can understand Jay just as well as I do. What is it? I was driving through Alabama the night I met Jay. He'd been caught with a boy by his parents, and his dad beat him until he was bleeding, then they kicked him out the house. I found Jay by the side of the road, bloody and beyond upset. So I moved him in with me, gave him a job at the parlor, and ever since he's been able to grow into the person he was meant to be in the first place. I had no idea. He's a good guy. I mean, it's just a shame he didn't realize 'cause everyone else was telling him different. Oh, god. Baby, I can explain. Hey babe, I just saw a photograph of you in your underwear. What? Oh right, yeah. Um, I was doing a bit of modelling. What do you think? I hit the big time with her. You both seem really happy together. Yeah, we are. * Do you ever feel like * You're stuck in that place and nobody cares * I don't wanna feel like * I'm back in that place when you're not there. Right, let's walk the rest of the way. We should head in. Let's do this. This is an apartment building, you idiot. You'll kill someone. No it was a totally awesome night, man, we loved it. Jay? Jay, stay calm, okay? We're gonna sort this out. No! This is your fault! You brought those fuckin' school bastards into my life! Joshua! Joshua, come back! Hey, queer boy. Did your boyfriend like the new makeover? Don't cross me again. Are you okay? Oh, wow. Josh! Josh, please. Josh, talk to me. Josh. Should I go after him? No. I love him to pieces but he was wrong to blame Joshua. I wouldn't worry about them, though. People only seem to realize what they have once it's gone. I've never seen Jay connect with someone so much before, though. He'll come up with something, you'll see. True love won't slip away that easily. I love you. This refers to informal and substandard vocabulary that people use every day. Hold on one second, class. Joshua, can I see you outside for a second, please? Sure. Come on. Alright Joshua, listen. Everybody knows what you've done already, okay? Now you're gonna have to head to Principal Wyatt's office immediately. We don't tolerate this type of stuff at our school. Alright? Now as I was saying, class. Take a seat. I saw your attack on Zac and Kaitlyn yesterday. We have a zero-tolerance policy for violence at this school. Do you care to explain yourself? You wouldn't get it even if I told you. What? You wouldn't get it, even if I told you. Okay, Joshua. Social services placed you in this school on a trial period. To see if it was a good fit for you. I need you to assure me that this will never happen again. It's not my decision to make. Okay, well Joshua, this is serious. And I need to know that this is gonna stop. Can you promise me that? No. Well I'm sorry but you've left me with no other choice but to expel you. You're to leave school grounds immediately, and you're not to return under any set of circumstances. Do you understand? I hope it does stop. I really do. It's not me who needs to change. Okay, he's coming. - You ready? - Yeah. Go, go! Hello, poppet! Cup of tea? Golden jubilee. Buckingham Palace. Delays on the Underground. Downton Abbey! One Direction! Um. Hi, Elijah. No, I'm Queen Elizabeth the... Tea pot! What are you doing? Now, Audrey! Oh my god, ow, what are you doing? Come on, get in, get in! - Oh my god! - Go! - Go go go! - Oh my god, oh my god. What's wrong with you? Are you mental? Let me out of the car! Are you crazy? Get off me! Oh my god! Quick! Lock the door, lock the door. I knew this would work, which means I win the bet. Okay, what do you want? No more herbal tea. But babe, you love your herbal tea. No one loves herbal tea! They do. I'm sorry that they ruined your work. I'm sorry I had my friends kidnap you. That's okay. If it helps, I broke the nose of the guy who did it. So, win-win. What? Yeah, the principal saw the whole thing and I kind of got expelled today. Sorry. What are you doing here? I'm sorry about the other night. They were obviously, like, sword fighting or whatever. But I can see why you got freaked out. Yeah, I'm sorry I overreacted. I wish I could stay. I have to go home for my lecture on being expelled. I'll walk you home. Elijah took the car. Okay. Hold him! Huh? You want more? Hey, Josh. Thanks for the broken nose. Just teaching... Get them. Little! Fucking! Fagot! Zac, enough! We don't wanna kill them! Fuck it. Come on. The police have announced that the victims of the recent murder investigation have been identified. Cause of death has yet to be released. However, police have made arrests. A young female and one young male. A suspect in the area is missing and also... Hey, Josh. We are still unsure of the motive behind the recent murders. We'll update you as news comes in. Babe, what is it? It's Jay. Jay? I love you. I love you too. Elizabeth Bates speaking. Hi, Elizabeth? Yeah, I just had an important document delivered. So I'm gonna run it right to you, are you at the office? No, Jenny, I'm working from home like I do every Saturday. Right. I'll be right there. Shit. Morning, Elizabeth. Morning, Jenny. - Have you got something for me? - Yes. I thought I'd bring it straight to you as it looks urgent. It's in regard to your client Anita Higgins and her son Joshua. Okay. Coffee? No that's fine, I've already got one. Oh. Jenny, that's fine. Oh, okay. Hello? Hello, Joshua? My name's Elizabeth Bates, I'm your mother's solicitor. I'm calling to inform you that the Canadian social services have been in contact regarding your biological father no longer wishing to take custody of you, which in the event of your mother's death, was her second instruction after the first to remain under the care of your step-father. As both of these have failed, our final option was to have you attend the same boarding school she did until you're 18. Therefore, you'll be on a flight later today returning you to England. The Canadian social services will be in contact with you shortly and they will usher you to your flight. And until you turn 18 you have no further say in the matter. Did you understand all of that? Okay. Take care, Joshua. Who was it? This isn't fair, it's not like we did anything wrong. - Just listen to me! - No, this is bullshit! Jay, come on, stop, please come back! What's happened? I have to go back to England. Look, he's probably gone back to his apartment. I'll go get changed and I'll take you there. Okay. You can't leave me, it's not fair. I don't have a choice. Just, don't let this be it. I promise. Love you. I don't understand! Let's go out back, I'll explain. So, explain. Well, I got kicked out of school for breaking a guy's nose and yeah, shipped me back here to go to that boarding school that mom went to until I'm 18. Okay, but why all the fighting? Oh my god. Is it that bad? Those people just didn't like who I was hanging out with. I was with this really nice guy called Jay. I'm gay, Noah. Were you happy together? Yeah. I'm glad. You deserve someone who makes you happy. Regardless of their gender or what anyone else thinks. Thanks, buddy. It doesn't always feel that way, so it's good to have you on my side. Josh, ignore the ignorant. I'm your brother. I'll always be on your side, no matter what. Thanks, Noah. And besides, I always knew you were gay. It's that obvious? Oh, please. The background you left me on that laptop, was a picture of Tom Daley in his budgie smugglers. Shit, I forgot about that. Cheers to you being back. Cheers. Jay? Oh my god. Happy 18th birthday. What are you doing here? I was always planning on seeing you on your birthday, and while I'm here I have an art show in London. How? One of the rich people we met at the art show has a gallery and is interested in my work. That's, amazing. Yeah. What? I just can't believe you're here. Of course I'm here. Having said that, let's get out of here. This place is kind of creepy. I know and the uniform is awful. I don't know. Actually, I kinda like the tie. I'm not the only one here, either. Guys! Oh my god. Hey, Josh! Hey. I can't believe you're all here. We couldn't let Jay travel on his own. The food here is terrible, by the way. I know. Joshua, you remember Charlotte. Right, the one who didn't want in on our painting foursome. I'm just kidding, hi Charlotte. Hey. Right, well we should go get ready for the show. Cool, I'll grab my bag. * Baby sit back, relax and unwind * Let me take you on a journey of your life * I wanna show how I feel. You'll smudge my makeup. What's your excuse? * You bring to me joy that I like Who are they? One of them works for the press and the other buys art to reproduce and sell. It's really impressive that they're here. I guess this makes me a proper artist now, huh? So if you've only just become a proper artist, does that mean you were just plain crazy when you threw paint all over me? - It's Noah, I'll be right back. - Okay. Hey, Noah. Come outside, I'm here. Happy birthday! Thank you. What are you doing here? I told you they wouldn't let under-18s in. Don't worry about that, I'm not here for the show. I just didn't wanna not see you on your birthday. So I'm here. And this, is for you. Noah, you didn't have to get me anything. Don't worry, I didn't. Now I gotta go, so enjoy the rest of your birthday, Josh. And bring Jay round the house tomorrow. It'd be nice to see him. I will. Thanks for all of this. See ya later. Could I have your attention, please? Hello everyone and thank you for coming tonight. The works of art you see here were created by a very special friend of mine. Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Mr. Jay Hopper. My god, they're looking at me. Should I go and speak? Yes. It's your moment, get over there. Hello, everyone. Thank you all for coming out, I really appreciate it. If you would like to see more of my work, there is a booklet you can take before you go that shows the best from my portfolio or you can check out my website for other options. And now, without further ado, let's go over to my first art piece and I'll talk about the inspiration for that one. * This is what it feels like * Don't ever change * Don't, don't ever change your way * Don't ever change. You will definitely be hearing from me soon. Thank you, I look forward to it. - Take care. - Have a good night. Can I take a picture of the two of you? Oh, of course. Thanks. - Thanks, be safe. - Have a good night. - Oh, wow! - Yeah, wow! You did that, man. Aw come here, I'm proud of you. And you deserve it. Right, well I'm going to find Sam and Charlotte somewhere then we're heading back to the hotel for obvious reasons. Babe, behave yourself. Come on, babe. - Okay see you later, guys. - See ya. - Bye, guys. - * Feel my heart drum * Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum. Do you like it? Yeah, I love it. This is for you. I'm moving to my first apartment this week and since you're 18 and all, I was hoping we could make it our apartment. Is it in Canada? No, it's about 20 minutes from here. You're moving to England? Of course I'll move in. Oh and I still have one more surprise. Now you're just spoiling me. Sit right here. Close your eyes. No peeking. Open. Happy birthday. You got me your crotch, isn't that thoughtful? Don't act like you haven't missed it.
