Rebbe: When the Baal Shem Tov lost his wife, do you know how he mourned? He said, "How am I going to go to heaven when half of me is left?" Eventually, Shmuel, he remarried. And when he lost his second wife, the love of his life, he said, "Okay." Shmuel: I fear for her, Rebbe, how she suffers now. Rebbe: Tend to your children. Take care of yourself.

Ecosystems--ecosystems are evolved to, simply and plainly, to create nourishment for new life. But some of these systems are pretty gosh darn inefficient.

Last year, Fivel got caught with a tape. Sender: What's on it? Moishe: All you need to know about dybbuk. Albert: Here, this is it. This is the one. Let's see. This is--yeah. Shmuel: Pigs? Albert: That's what you're gonna want, yep, pigs. It says they use pigs because they most closely resemble people when it comes to their fattiness, and their hairiness, and general deliciousness for insects, you know? I mean, who doesn't like bacon? Percy the piglet here, he was accidentally crushed by his mum, so they gave him to science. Okay, let's see. Let's see now. Fresh, fresh, the fresh stage. Okay, the body begins to degrade very early on, cells die, tissues break down, and bacteria in the body begin to digest the body from the inside out. There's not too much visible from the outside in just yet. Except for livor mortis, a pooling of blood thanks to gravity, and rigor mortis. You know, arthritis for dead people. Chemicals in the body are beginning to attract insects and maggots are taking up residence. The eyes, if they've remained open, will dry out and turn a blackish hue. Bloat; now the body is beginning to puff up and swell, become engorged. All the gases and juices are being produced in excess inside the body as the bacteria goes to town. And nobody's flatulating anymore, so, you know, nowhere to else go. And the maggots, now at home under the skin, are all sorts of creepy and crawly, which causes more and more swelling. Skin slippage, gross, is occurring, hair is falling out. Vessels are now visible, which is apparently called marbling. Now it gets interesting. Active Decay. The body's outer capsule, our earthly coil, skin, muscle, soft tissue, it's all--it's breaking open. The body deflates, like a popped balloon. The corpse is putrefying. Shmuel: Putrefrying? Albert: Putrefry--no, putrefrying, that's funny though. No, putrefying. It's purging. And carnivores, if there are any in the neighborhood, are beginning to have a field day. They eat that shit up. Whew, advanced--here, advanced Decay. The body is reduced to tiny bits of skin, and clumps of cartilage and bone. Mummification is the end result as the remains are dehydrated and desiccated. There you go. Shmuel: And how long does this take? Albert: It says, yada, yada, yada, any number of factors can--who really knows, right? I mean, as concerns your wife. Shmuel: So, how could one know? Albert: Well, I suppose one could bury a pig, right? But I don't imagine that that's--yeah. Shmuel: Thank you for your time. Albert: Of course.
