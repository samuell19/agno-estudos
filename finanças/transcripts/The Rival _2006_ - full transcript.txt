- I thought you were gonna pick up cash for the restaurant, Alice. - I know, but I was at the doctor's all day. I was waiting for the ultrasound. - Of course you were. - What's that supposed to mean? - It's this what I have to look forward to for the next 8 months? You not being able to do a damn thing? - Come on, David. It wasn't my fault. - If you'd remembered to take your pill, we wouldn't be in this situation. But I suppose that wasn't your fault either, right? - No. It was an accident. - Yeah, I know. An accident. - I promise, when the baby comes it's gonna be the most amazing thing that you have ever been a part of. - You must think that if you keep telling me that, eventually I'll be convinced. I've told you time and time again I'm not ready to be a father. Nothing you can say is gonna change that. - I just think that once you see the ba... - No, Alice! This is something we should've both agreed on and wanted. God, I trusted you! No. If you want this baby, you're gonna have it on your own. - What? - I mean it. You made this decision by yourself, you can deal with it by yourself. - What are you saying to me? You're gonna leave me? David, I'm pregnant with your child! You can't just walk out! Listen, we can do this together! We can be a family! We'll figure it out! - I don't wanna be a father, Alice. And I don't wanna be with someone who would lie to me. - I didn't lie to you! - I'll be right back. - No, here, here. I'll do it. - Gimme your money. - Hey! Get away from her! - David! Hey! You're here already! - Hey. Yeah, my meeting got out a little early so I thought I'd just find a place where I could sit and get some work done. - Well, great! - The doctor's on time so they said she should be out in a minute. - Okay. Hey, I wanted to tell you about this article I read. It's about how babies bond with their parents' voices just by listening to them before they're born. - Oh yeah? - Hey, guys. - Hey! - Come on in. Any luck? - No, not yet. - No. None of those women were really what we were looking for, Doctor. - These were the ones that were willing to live in the house with you during the pregnancy. Now if you've changed your mind about that condition, I've got some wonderful candidates for you to consider. - Well, actually, that's a condition we are not willing to budge on. - You know that Allie lost a child before; so being present during the pregnancy is just... It's very important to her. - I understand. Well, I did call the New York and Boston offices, and... Here are some women that are willing to relocate to Philadelphia and live in the house with you till the baby's born. But please understand that if you don't find anyone in there, I'm afraid I can't help you. Right now, we're running out of options. - Thank you, Claire. But just about every weekend during the summer, you can find me at the beach! I'm a total... - You've got to be kidding me. - I love to swim... - "I'm Danielle, I'm from Boston, I'm a paralegal and I'm a complete bimbo!" - Yeah, well, that's the last one, Allie. - I don't like any of them, George. - Look, I know we haven't found anyone yet, but like Dr. Aitchinson says, it's not gonna be easy for us to find someone who's willing to live with us for the next 9 months. And on top of that, you seem to want to find this ideal person. - Linda says that I can't find anybody because I'm scared of losing another baby. - Oh, hey... You are not gonna lose another baby. We're gonna have the family that you've always dreamed of. And I want this as much as you do. Look, I'll call around to some other agencies tomorrow. Don't worry. We're gonna find the right surrogate. Honey, I know bad things have happened in your life. But now it's time for good things. And only good things. - I love you. - I love you too. What's the matter? Did you have a bad dream? Come here. You're sweating. Hey! - Hi! I'm going into the store early today. - Okay. Have a good day. I'll see ya. I love you. - You too. - Come on in. I'll be right with you. - Hi! Hey Stacie, it's me. - Hi, Alice! I just opened. - I have some things I need to take care of this morning, so do you think Sure! - Good. Um, just call if you need anything, all right? - I got you some daisies at the market. I know they're your favourites, right? - You're a dear. - So, um... Why did you call, Aunt Estelle? Do you need something? - Well, yes. Alice, I can't stay here anymore. - Really? Why? - I hate it here. This new chef they hired is a complete joke. Stray dogs wouldn't eat his food. I'm wasting away. - Well, I think that's a little extreme. - Ha! You'd probably be happy if I just withered away in this... shack! - No, but Linda says it's one of the best in the city. It's very expensive. - Linda says? What else does Linda say? - She says that I need to stop letting you manipulate me like you're trying to do right now. - Manipulate you? Oh! How dare she? I raised you when you had no one! If it weren't for me, you would have ended up in some orphanage somewhere! And no one would have adopted a child like you! - Okay look, I don't need to sit here and listen to this abuse. - Wait, wait! I... I didn't mean that. You're the only one I can count on, Alice. I wanna come live with you. - What? - You'll need help once the baby's born. - No, no. George and I don't want anybody living with us. - Well, you might feel differently once George leaves you for the pretty little surrogate... the real mother of his baby. - Why do you always say things just to hurt me? - Hurt you? I'm trying to help you! I'm trying to warn you before it happens! Well, it's probably for the best. You don't have what it takes to make a good mother anyway. - Aunt Estelle, you have to stop judging me! George loves me very much! He's not leaving me! - If he knew your secret, he would. - If you say anything, I will tell everybody that you are senile and a liar. - I don't care about "everybody!" All that matters is if George believes me. Right, dear? - I'm leaving. - Get me out of here, Alice! - I hate you! Don't let her control you. Don't let her control you. - Lisa, why haven't we heard back on the Bardley Hills project? - I mentioned it to you yesterday. They said they won't respond to bids until next week. At the earliest. - Then this report should reflect that. - It does. - What? - You see? That line right here. - Aha! So it does. I'm sorry. My mind has just been... somewhere else. - The surrogate candidates? - Yeah. - It's not going well? - No. No, it's not. It's an emotional process, and Allie wants to find... the perfect one. - She's right to be picky. Excuse me. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. - Well, that's what I figured. No, please do. Call me if you find anyone who will. Yeah. - All right, thank you. Well, that's it. I called 3 other agencies this morning and none of them have surrogates who would be willing to live with us for the next 9 months. Imagine that. - I have an idea. You know, Jennifer, the one that's been living with me since my divorce? She's smart, pretty, she's responsible, and who knows? Maybe she'd be open to it. - Really? - Yeah! Jennifer would be a great choice, and I know she could really use the money. - Sara's asleep? - Mm-hmm. Just got her down. - So... What do you think about helping them out? - Well, you're right, it would get me out of debt and that would be wonderful, but... I don't know about being a surrogate. - I know it's a lot to consider, but it would mean so much to them. And George is a terrific guy and they've wanted a baby for a long time. - You never told me why she can't have one of her own. - Actually, she was pregnant several years back, but she got mugged at an ATM. The guy pulled a gun and shot her. - What? - Yeah. Her husband too, and he died. - Oh, my God! That's terrible! - Alice had to have a full hysterectomy. That's why, if you were the surrogate, they'd have to use your eggs. - I think that's the worst thing that could ever happen to a woman, to be told that she can't have her own biological children. I thought I had it bad. I don't even know how you get over something like that. - I don't think she's ever given up hope on having her own family. - Maybe she's putting her past behind her. - How do you think Sara would be with it? - I think she'd be okay if I explained it to her. You know Sara. If she doesn't understand something, she just keeps asking questions until she does. - True. - I don't care if I have to put her at the Four Seasons. She is not staying here. Honey? - Yeah! - Hey! - Hi! - What are you doing? - Um, just some work stuff. Nothing important. Any news about the other agencies? - No. No, not yet. But... I'm working on a few different options. - Okay. - So you had the dream again, huh? - Yeah. I'm back in the courtroom and there's a box sitting on a table. It's beautifully wrapped. For some reason, I feel compelled to hide this box. But every time I hide it, it just reappears back on the table. - Is the judge in this dream? - Yes. He's just sitting there, watching me. He's got that horrible mask on with the... It looks like he's smiling, but it's very, very scary. And George is there. He has his back to me, and when he turns around... he's got those dark glasses on like he can't see anything. And I hand him the skit box... and he takes it from me and he opens it up. And... I kill him, Dr. Zeller. - All right. Now, this box... You said it was beautifully wrapped? - Yeah. - All right. A box is meant to carry something, right? Protect something. Keep something safe. - Like a baby? - Mm-hmm. So... It represents the surrogate that you and George have decided to get. But you're ashamed of it, so you try and hide it. You wish you could have the baby yourself, huh? And the judge is... - Yeah, he's just watching the whole time. - We've been through this before. Your aunt Estelle is the judge. She berates you a lot for the decisions you make. She judges you. But you wanna love her, because... she raised you. That's why you keep putting a mask on her in the dream. - Why is George blind? - What don't you want him to see? - Um, maybe it's because... Well, could it be because I've kept Aunt Estelle a secret from him? I don't want him to see her? - Could be. Or maybe you don't want him to see the real you. Maybe you're afraid he won't love you if he knew who you really are. - But he does love me. I know he loves me. Why are we shooting each other in the dream? - It's your fear of losing another baby. But, Alice, this time you also have the gun, because you're determined not to let that happen again. - George would never hurt me, though. - Alice, this is all about being scared. So let's just get past the fear and your sense of inadequacy about needing a surrogate, okay? - I just feel like I've imposed on Lisa long enough. Um, my husband died when he was starting a business, so I got stuck with a lot of the debt. - I'm sorry. So, what do you do for a living? - Well, my degree is in English, and when Sara was young, I did a lot of freelance copywriting. - You'd be okay having a baby and then giving it up? I mean after 9 months of forming a mother-child bond, you... you wouldn't find that difficult? - Ah... That's a really hard question. I think I'd be okay, as long as I knew that the child had wonderful parents who would give it everything. - All right, so... Bottom line: you're okay living with us for 9 months? - Well, I'll admit it's a little different, but... I actually think it would make me feel more comfortable, rather than just handing the child off to someone I didn't know. - You know, I think Alice is gonna love you. - I don't get to travel as much as George does, but I do get to Italy twice a year. One of my suppliers is in Rome. - I spent a couple of summers in Rome. My father's family's from there. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Lisa came with me one year; we shopped till we dropped! The Italian designers are the best! - I know! Every time I go, I spend a fortune on clothes! - Yeah, you do. You see, I thought you two would have something in common. - Well, Jennifer, what do you think? Would you be willing to be our surrogate? - Yeah. - Great. Thank you. We can't wait to meet your daughter. - She's gonna love you guys. - So, George, if the procedure works, I guess we're... we're finally gonna have our baby! - I think we are! Thank you. - Aunt Estelle? - I'm ready to come live with you! - No, I told you, you cannot come stay with us! - Oh, and one more thing... I can't forget my mask and my gavel! I'm moving in with you and George whether you like it or not! - Stop it!! Aunt Estelle? Are you here? - You ask that like you care. I'm surprised you could fit me into your busy schedule. - Well, I brought you something. - What are these? - They're assisted-living complexes and they're really nice. Let me show you my favourite one, okay? Two covered balconies. - You're missing the point, Alice. I'm done with living here and every single one of these stupid old fogy homes. I want to live with you! - I've already explained to you why you can't live with us. - It doesn't make any sense. - You just can't, all right? We're gonna have a full house when... when Jennifer and her daughter come to stay. - Jennifer? So you actually found someone. - Yeah. She's really great. I really like her a lot. - Well, whoopee and good for you, but I know there's plenty of room for all of us. - Aunt Estelle, listen to me. You are not coming to live with us, period! Okay? So just get the idea out of your head! -You listen to melice. I'm moving in with you and George in that big fancy house of yours whether you like it or not. If I have to stay here one more day, I'm writing a nice long letter to George. You were a very disturbed little girl. - Aunt Estelle... - I saw you come back to your mother's house that night, crawl through the window... Thought no one would know. And the next morning, when we found out and told you that your daddy had died in that fire, you tried to act surprised. But I knew the truth. I knew you'd set that fire. Now George is gonna know too. - Aunt Estelle, please don't tell him. - You're crazy if you think he's going to have a baby with someone as messed up as you. - You won't tell him! - I would tell him. I don't like it here. - Well, he's not gonna believe some old bitch over his own wife! He doesn't even know you exist! - Well, that just proves what a liar you are, doesn't it? I raised you after your mother killed herself. I could've put you in an orphanage! You owe me! - Why are you so hateful? - Why are you so selfish? - Linda says that I should not let you control me. - Oh, I don't care what Linda says! - I won't let you do this, Aunt Estelle. - Well, you have no choice. - Shut up! - That was no accident. Your father didn't fall asleep with a lit cigarette. - Stop it! - How long did you watch before running out of the house yourself? - Stop it! - George is gonna go hightailing... - No! I can't let you talk about it anymore, Aunt Estelle. - Ahh! Ah! - I don't want you to die but I know you're gonna tell George, and I... I just can't let you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. Help! Please! My aunt, she... She just took a really bad fall. - It's room 521. Please hurry! - Alice, are you okay? - I'm fine. What's this? - Oh, that woman that just left, she wants me to give her a call when that crib comes in from Italy. She didn't even blink when she saw the price tag. You should hear that woman's story. The father of her baby is married to somebody else. - What? - Yeah. They've been together for 6 years. He bought her a condo and everything. And he finally filed for divorce when he found out that she was pregnant. - So she's running off with a married man. - Yeah. Can you believe that drama? - You know, I don't want someone like that as a customer. - Well, it takes all kinds. - No, I'm serious. The woman's obviously a slut. - But... - But what? - We're talking about a $2,000 crib! - If she comes in here again, Stacie, tell her we don't want her business, all right? And if you don't tell her, I will. - Okay... You might feel differently once George leaves you for the pretty little surrogate... the real mother of his baby. It's probably for the best. - Hey! - Ah! - What's going on? You've been jumpy all night! - I... I'm sorry. I don't know what's the matter with me. - When do you see Dr. Zeller again? - Friday. Not until Friday. - So... I'll have a brother or sister? - So, this dream that you had last night... It was only George in the courtroom? - Yeah. - What about the judge in the mask? Wasn't he there? - No, he wasn't. - Well... This is the first time in weeks you've had the dream without him. - You know what? You're right, actually. - The judge always represented your aunt Estelle. Interesting that she was absent from this one. So why do you think that is, Alice? - I haven't dreamt about the judge since my aunt Estelle died. - Your aunt died, Alice? - Yeah, a few days ago. - What happened? - She hit her head or something. I don't know. The nurses wouldn't really give me any details. - What do you mean, they wouldn't give you any details? Did you speak to someone in charge? The executive director, maybe? - Um, I tried, but it was unclear. I don't... I don't exactly know what happened. - And she was at Meadow View, right? - Yeah. Why do you think the box disappears in this dream? - Alice... Your aunt's death, honey... How'd you feel when they told you? Were you... angry? Relieved? What? - I don't know. I mean, it was a shock when it first happened, but... I'm okay now. I'm good now. - You had a lot of anger towards her you never had the chance to express. You know, sometimes, when that happens, we run the whole gamut of emotions. We have sadness, anger, guilt, hostility... - No, not really. - Sometimes those feelings are so deeply rooted... - Look, I already told you that I don't feel guilty or any of those other things that you were just saying, so... You know, my hour is almost up and I really wanna talk about what happened in my dream. - Alice... I wouldn't be a very good therapist, would I, if I didn't try to help you explore your feelings about your aunt's death? - I realise that, but I wanna focus on the future. - Yes, but you can't do that if you have unanswered questions, honey. - I don't have any questions! You're not listening to me! I don't wanna talk about my aunt! This is my session, that I have paid for, and I am here to figure out my dream, okay? I don't wanna talk about my aunt, so don't bring her up again, now or ever! - I'm sorry, Alice. We have to. - No, we don't! I'm... Wow! I'm sorry. - No, it's okay, Alice. - I'm really sorry. I... I'm gonna use the restroom. What are you doing? Stop acting crazy. She doesn't know. She doesn't know. - Alice? Alice? Alice, are you all right? - I'm sorry about your ashtray. - Don't worry about that. I'm more concerned with you and how you're feeling right now. - Um, I'm okay. I'm better. I just don't know what happened in there, though. - Well, I'd say what happened is really important. Unfortunately, our time's up for today. But this is something that we'll work on next time, okay? - Okay. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you acting like that? You were making progress. And Linda s... Hey, Tiff. It's me. - I've got a question for you. You know your friend who works in administration - over at Meadow View rest home? - - Yeah. Will you have her give me a call, please? There's something I need to talk to her about. - - All right. Thanks. I appreciate it. - Honey, they're here! - Coming! - Hey, you guys! - Hi! Congratulations! I'm so excited! - Thank you. - Hey, how are ya? - Good! - How are you feeling? - Oh, good. Great. - Well, I just bought a big can of protein powder. - Mmm... - Mom says it tastes like plaster. - But it's good for the baby, Sara. That's what's important. - Well, you know what? I think the baby's doing fine. Hey, let me help you with your stuff. - Okay. - Come on, I'll show you your room. Sara! Where are you? Sara? - Can I have this? - Well, that one was for the baby. That's why it was in the crib. - Can I play with it till the baby comes? Then I'll give it to her. - For a little while. So, what do you think of your room? George even put some new games in the computer for you. - I'm gonna sleep in my mom's bed with her and the baby in her tummy. - But don't you like this room, Sara? - It's okay, but I'm gonna sleep with her like we do at Lisa's. - But wouldn't it be fun to have your own place to sleep and everything? - Mom says I can sleep with her. - Here, let me get that. - Are you sure? - Put it right here. Oh yeah, I can manage. - You better be careful, or I'll give you the heavy ones with all my books. - Well, don't worry about it. I drink protein shakes. - Yeah, apparently so do I! - All right, come on. It's starting, Alice. Just like I said it would. Linda Zeller. Oh yes, hi! Thank you for calling. Listen, something happened over at Meadow View with a resident that I was sort of concerned about, and I was hoping you could give me more information. No, it's for one of my patients. Her aunt passed away there recently and she's been having trouble getting details about what happened from the staff. - Alice Mailer. And the resident's name was Estelle McMurry. Wait. Are you telling me Alice was there when it happened? I see. No. Thank you. I appreciate your call. Hey, honey. I'm going for a run. - I talked with Sara. I don't have to pick her up till noon. - Good. - Wait, you're not going jogging too, are you? - Yeah! - But won't all that bouncing around be bad for the baby? - No, it's fine. The doctor said a little light jogging's no problem. My last 10K was 3 months ago. - Oh yeah? All right, see you in a little bit. Bye, honey. - Bye. - Bye. - They make a good couple. I told you, but you wouldn't listen. - What? - You thought killing me would solve all your problems. Ha, ha, ha! I'm the least of your problems, Alice. Ha, ha, ha! Stop sign! - What do I have to do to get rid of you? - You can't get rid of me. Shut the hell up! I'll go when I'm ready! Hello? - Alice, it's Linda. - Hi, Linda. Um, why are you calling me on a Saturday? - Listen, I was thinking about - I'm really sorry about what happened. - No, honey, that's not what I was calling about. I wanna see you again before next Friday, okay? - Uh, no, it's not. I have to be in the store by 9. - All right. Um, how about afternoon? Say around 4. - Well, that's not good either. The store doesn't close until 6. - I'm sorry, I can't make it any later because I teach a class at the university on Monday nights. - Okay, uh... Four o'clock then. - Good. I'll see you then. - Bye. - Oh, you cooked! I thought you were gonna go out to dinner with George like you did last Saturday. Sara wanted to stop for cheeseburgers. - Yeah, I thought I would do something special tonight. - Well, that's really nice. Hey, if we're lucky, we'll have leftovers tomorrow, right? - So you got a cheeseburger too? - Yeah. The cravings have started! - Well, I'm not so sure that greasy, salty fast food is that great for the baby. - Well, you told us you ate healthy. - Well, I don't think a cheeseburger every now and then is gonna hurt anybody, do you? Especially if I get a French fry. - Actually, uh, Alice is right. I think that, uh, I just let my cravings get the better of me. So... We'll eat whatever you cook. It smells better than these cheeseburgers anyway. - Good. - Oh, I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean to wake you up. - Mom... When the baby comes, what if I like it? Maybe I'll want a brother or sister and we could keep it. - Honey, I told you. We can't keep the baby. It belongs to George and Alice. - I don't get why it belongs to Alice. You're the mommy, George is the daddy, and I'm the big sister. - Well... Honey, it's complicated. I'll tell you what. Why don't you go to sleep? We'll talk about it in the morning, okay? - Okay. - You know, you don't always have to take her side. - Honey, the cheeseburger was in her mouth. - George, if it's not good for the baby, it's not good for the baby! And it's our baby, remember? - Yeah, Alice. I do remember that. - It's like she doesn't care because she knows she's giving the baby away. - That is just not true! She said she ate the same thing when she was pregnant with Sara! - You know what, that's not even the point. You don't always have to take her side! - There are noides here, Alice! Everybody wants the same thing! Listen to me. The only thing that I care about is you and the baby. Period. I just want them to be happy and comfortable while they're living under our roof. - Okay. George is the dad. m the mom. How hard can that be to explain to your child? These are pretty slutty. - Alice! Hi! - Hey! - Hi! I'm... surprised to see you here, Jennifer. - George and I sort of got a last-minute project and we needed a copywriter. So Jennifer's gonna be working with us part-time for a little while. - Really? - It's just for a few days, but I could really use the extra money. - Who knows? After the baby, maybe it'll become full-time. I keep telling them we really need someone in-house. - Great! - We're gonna go to lunch. Wanna come with us? - Thanks. Actually, I'm here to have lunch with my husband. - Okay. We'll see you later. - Okay. That's really convenient. - Hey, you! - Hey! You ready to go? - Ah, I'm an idiot. I've got a 2 o'clock meeting I completely forgot about. - Ohh... - So I took the liberty of ordering in your favourite salad. - Oh, great! - Yeah? It'll be here in a second. - Okay. - You look great. - So do you. Um, I saw Jennifer in the hallway... - Yeah, we're gonna redo the whole website. I think it's gonna be really helpful for her. - Is she qualified to do that? - Yeah! Absolutely. She was a copywriter, and I think she knows quite a bit about html. - You know, George, I was thinking that we should buy her a treadmill so she can work out without leaving the house. - Ah, that's a nice gesture, baby, but I have a feeling that she actually likes to get out of the house when she runs. You know she was certified as a personal trainer in college? - Really? - Mm-hmm. Who knows? Maybe our kid will be an athlete. Wouldn't that be something? - Well, I'd rather our baby be smart, like you. - Thank you. I gotta tell you, I really think we lucked out with Jennifer. Out of all the surrogates we looked at, she's definitely got the most going for her. And I tell you, honey, I think we're gonna have a beautiful little baby. - Why were you prying into my personal affairs? - I was the one who recommended Meadow View to you, remember? So I was concerned when you said they wouldn't give you information. That's why I called, Alice. - Well, that really wasn't any of your business, was it? - Well, you said you were having trouble getting details. I'm sorry, I... was trying to help. - I don't need your help! - Alice, I don't understand. Why did you tell me you weren't there when she died? - Because I knew you were gonna do this! I don't wanna talk about my aunt Estelle! I... wanna pretend like she never existed, frankly. Then why'd you even go there? - Because she kept calling me. She hated Meadow View and she wanted to move in with me and George and I couldn't let her do that. - So you went there to tell her that in person? - Yes! Yes! And to bring her brochures of other places she could go. Nice places. - She didn't like those other options? - No! She kept insisting! She never listened! You know? She kept insisting on moving in with George and me. And when I said she couldn't, then... - When you told her she couldn't, then... What was she going to do, Alice? - Nothing. - No. You just said: "When I told her she couldn't," like she was threatening to do something. - No. No, she wasn't threatening anything. I'm done talking about this. - Don't worry, okay? We'll get through this together. I promise. See you next Friday, huh? - Yeah. - Okay. She's onto you, Alice. She's going to find out what you did. It's just a matter of time. - Goodbye, honey. - Hey! Did you get everything done that you needed to? - Yeah, I pretty much took care of everything. - Well, good. At least one of us is done for the night. I still have to call Singapore. - Where's Jennifer? - Hm? Oh, I think they're curled up watching a DVD. Come here, I wanna show you something. What do you think of this? - It's a swing set. - Yeah. I was thinking of putting one in the backyard for Sara. - I think you're doing too much for Sara. - What do you mean, too much? - Well, this isn't her home, George. - Ah, Allie, come on! Look, don't be offended by what she said. Kids have a hard time understanding sometimes. - Well, you need to understand that once the baby's born, we're never gonna see them again. - Don't you think that's a little bit extreme? - George, Jennifer is a carrier. And we both decided on minimal contact after the birth. - Yeah, I know what we decided on, but seeing as how they're... - Minimal contact means pictures on the baby's birthday. That's it. - Allie, come on! It's not like they're gonna be moving to Alaska! - Well, they may as well, George, because I don't want them here when the baby is born! - Come on, Alice, there's a bond that forms! It's... - I know! That's what I'm talking about! You are getting too close to both of them! You know what? Jennifer is carrying our child, and getting close to Sara, getting close to any kid, honey, is just gonna make us better parents! - I am not Sara's mother, thank God, and you are not her father, no matter how close you wanna get to "Jenny!" I have no interest in Jennifer other than making sure that she is happy and healthy while she's carrying our child! - Well, it sure seems like more than that! - Well, you know what? It's not. It's not. And if it's gonna make you this upset, we need to ask them to move out, because personally I don't care if they're here or not! Is that what you want? - No. - Yeah, I didn't think so. You know what, Alice? I'm going for a walk. Alice... George wants a real family. Once he sees his baby, he'll stay with Jennifer and you'll be all alone. - You're dead and you won't shut up! - Oh, Alice... I warned you this would happen. - Be quiet, Aunt Estelle! - Things are really falling apart now. - I know. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know! - I'm worried about Alice. - You are? - Well, she's been acting so strange lately, and she just can't stop killing people. - Alice? Is this true? - No! - Well, she killed Dr. Zeller, and an aunt that you never even heard about. And she killed her father when she was 12 years old. - Be quiet! George, she's a slut! Look at her! - But she's the mother of my child. - No, it's my baby! - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. No, no, no. Definitely not. It's too soon to say. Well, when the time is right, we tell everyone. Who cares? Let the chips fall where they may at that point. - No, you can tell me now! - Let me call you right back. - Where is she? - Where's who? - Jennifer! - Allie, I was on the phone to Peter Chan in Singapore! I told you I had to make that call! - Just tell me the truth! - The truth about what? - I can't take these secrets, George! Just tell me... Are you going to leave me when the baby comes? - What? - Jennifer! Are you going to divorce me and marry her? Is that your plan? And I'm not gonna take the baby. I think we need to rethink this living arrangement. Doesn't seem to be working out. - I made such a huge mistake. I didn't... I didn't mean to... - Alice! Alice! Just stop! - You have to tell her not to leave, George! - Tell her not to leave? How is she ever gonna be comfortable in this house again? - I know! I made a mistake! I'm sorry! Please, you have to convince her not to go! Please! - Maybe it'd be better if she did, Allie. You've been miserable since the day she walked through that door. - I know. I know. I, um... I think I'm just under a lot of stress. I'm really worried about everything, you know. But I'm gonna be okay, so please talk to her, George. You can fix this. - Allie, Allie, stop. Don't do this to yourself. You're just making yourself crazy. I'll go talk to her tomorrow, okay? - Okay. - Right now you just need to get some sleep, okay? - You'll talk to her tomorrow? Okay. - Let me take you up. Anything else? Even if it was a robbery assault, I still want a list of all of Dr. Zeller's patients and anybody else she would have been involved with. Thanks. - How are you this morning? - Okay. - Look, um... About last night... - Yeah, before you say anything, I just want you to know that I'm gonna move back in with Lisa. It's just not comfortable here. - I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted was for you and Sara to feel unwelcome. - Well, it's not good for Alice either. - This... this baby is so important to her... - Look, I know she's been through a lot, but... - She's just terrified that something's gonna happen and she's gonna lose this baby too. You don't know how many surrogates we looked at before we found you. If you can just stick it out, I think Allie will work through this like she's worked through everything else in her life. She just needs a little more time. Look, Jennifer, I... I... I can't tell you what to do with your life... but I hope you stay. Give Alice another chance. - I need some time to think about it. I'm not making any promises. - I understand. Thank you. - Jennifer, I... I just want to apologise to you for last night. I'm... very ashamed of my behaviour and I'm really sorry. I was kind of hoping that I could take you to lunch today and have a heart-to-heart. There's a really great Italian place downtown. It's authentic. - Thanks, Alice, but I actually already told Lisa that I would meet her at Kylie's Café for lunch, so... another time. - Sure. Sure. - We're late. - I know. - Got everything? - Yeah. - So she's gonna have lunch with Lisa. Doesn't she realise how important this is? They're gonna talk about me. They're gonna talk about me. That's why they didn't invite me to come along. - Jennifer's seeing through you. - Be quiet! I'm trying to think! - Once Lisa hears what you did, she'll tell Jennifer to move back in with her, and goodbye baby! - They're gonna talk about me. - If you don't do something soon, it'll be too late. - Hey, Sarge! You got the rest of those patient files on the Zeller case? - On the way. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Okay, Alice, just... just go in there and tell them how sorry you are. Don't ruin it. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. - I can't believe it. - She's completely out of control. She got into a big fight with George last night. You should've heard her. She actually accused George of wanting to divorce her and marry me after the baby's born. - I can't believe it. You shouldn't be in a situation like that. Do you wanna move back in with me? I mean, I think you need to get out of there before things get worse. - Oh, boy... - Alice... - How could you do this to me? - What? - Is this what you do? You come here and you say terrible things about me when I'm not around? - No! Jennifer and I were just talking! - You have been against me from the beginning! - Alice, please! - And you lied to me! You said that you were gonna stay with us until after the baby was born! - Alice, why don't you just sit down with us and we can all discuss this? - If you cared about my opinion, you would've invited me in the first place! - Look, I just want what's best for everyone. - No, you don't! You have wanted her to be with George since we started! - That's not true! How can you possibly believe that? - Listen, if you think that I'm gonna sit back and let you take my husband and my baby... Nobody takes my baby away, you bitch! - Alice! - I'm sorry, I've gotta go. - You see what you did? This is your fault! - Calm down. Just let me help you. - You hate me! - No! But I've never seen you like this! - What am I doing? - It's okay. Okay, come here. Come here. Sit down. Sit down. I'm gonna call George. I'm gonna call George. George, it's me. - I'm at Kylie's. Can you come down here, please? I'm with Alice What do you mean, she's not doing well? - I can't explain. Just come down, please. - I'll be right there. - Alice, it's all right. You'll be fine. You'll be okay. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - You okay? - We lost Jennifer. - She left pretty upset. - It's okay, Allie. Come on. Shh, shh. Let's go home. I'll call you in a little bit. - Okay. - Okay... Who's next on the list? Alice Mailer, Fountain Heights. - George, you can't let her go! - Oh, Alice... - Jennifer! Please, I'm so sorry! - I have to, Alice. - No, you don't! We can pretend like none of this ever happened! We can! George, she's gonna take the baby! - Alice, stop it! I'll talk to her. Stay out here. - I'm done, George! - Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry, I... I never thought it would get this bad. - You need to get her some help. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. - Why? Why is this happening to me? - Don't be so surprised. - Leave me alone! - Go ahead, Alice. Kill yourself. Your mother did. - I don't want to... - Alice! Honey, put it down. - He's leaving with her, Alice. End it now. - Shut up! - I'll call 911. - If she leaves this house, George, I'm gonna do it. I swear to God. - No, hey, hey, hey, honey, it's okay. It's okay. - Please hurry. She's got a knife and she's threatening to kill herself. Fountain Heights? This is Detective Martin, responding to that 901A. I'm in the neighbourhood. - Come on, Allie, give me the knife. We're gonna work everything out. - I'm so scared, George! - I know. I know. I know. - Do it, Alice. - Allie, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Listen to me. I'm gonna get you help. Okay? Please don't do this, honey. - They're taking your baby! - You betrayed me. - No. No, Allie, I didn't. I didn't. Come on. Give me the knife. - Help me! Help me! Please help me! - Are you Alice Mailer? - No, she's inside! She just stabbed her husband! - Stay here! - Please hurry! Oh, God! Oh, my God! - Don't move! - I think he's dead. - This is Detective Martin. I need an ambulance and backup at 13 Josephine Road. One victim. - So, how's that project coming along? - Pretty good. I'll probably spend the day tomorrow trying to finish it up. You? - I have to drop Sara off at a playdate tomorrow morning, then I've gotta get caught up on the writing for that travel site. - Is that the last web page? - Yes, all done! Last job in Philly. On to Pittsburgh. New job, new home... - You've come so far, Jennifer, and I'm really proud of you. - I could never have done it without you. - I'm really gonna miss you guys. - I'm gonna miss you too. You gotta come visit often... if your new boyfriend will let you get away. Oh, he will. - Come on, let's go eat. - Mmm! Yummy! Some more? Where's the airplane going? It's going into the airport! Ahh... - You want fried eggs? - No... scrambled. - Okay. - Yesterday's statement by the President that he believes the peace talks are going well and that an agreement will be reached soon is being greeted with some scepticism... - Aunt Lisa! - In local news, authorities are saying that they have recaptured 2 of the 3 female inmates from the Kendall Nowlin Institute for the Criminally Insane who escaped this morning, but that a third inmate remains at large. - Morning! - Morning! - Morning. - Good morning! - Can I help? - Mom wants to know if you want fried or scrambled. - Scrambled, please. Do you want me to watch Shannon while you take Sara this morning? - Yeah! Do you mind? - No, not at all. - That'd be great. - Yummy! - All right, you got everything? - Yeah. - It's time to go to sleep, little Shannon. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Ohh yeah... Shh... Sleepy time. Ah, yes! Go to sleep, baby! Go to sleep, baby. - Bye, Mom! - Have a good time, sweetheart! - Hi, Sara! How are you? - Hi! Fine! - I realise they said they were headed out of the country, but... Did anybody notify Jennifer Adler? 'Cause I don't think Alice is going anywhere without her baby. - All right, all right. Just do me a favour, all right? Send a patrol car out to the house just to be safe. - Ohh! Look at you! You're so beautiful! Hello! Ohh yeah! You're such a beauty! We don't have much time. We gotta get packed. - Lisa? I'm home! Hey! Hi! Who turned this on, huh? Where's your aunt Lisa? Lisa? Oh, my God! Ah! - I came for my baby. - You can't have her, Alice! - Well, if the psych ward couldn't stop me, what makes you think that you can? - She needs me! You know that! - I'm her mother. She isybaby. - They get along so well. - Sara loves her little sister. - Yeah, but wait till they start fighting, just like we did. - Hmm... I hope that doesn't happen. - It's only natural. When you put 2 kids together under the same roof, they're gonna be rivals. - Not just kids, Lisa. Not just kids.
