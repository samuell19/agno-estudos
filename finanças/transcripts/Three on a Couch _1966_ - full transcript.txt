been really deeply in love with Richard I mean not the way you think of being deeply in love like in the Russian novels my Romeo and Juliet I Greta Garbo movie but I should thought I was in love with him oh gosh I was crazy about that guy my stomach turned over every time he came into the room and if you just touched me accidentally well Susan do you have to do that while you're talking it's good for the abdominal muscles but it's better for your subconscious if you just lie still oh my mind's working all the time boy I'm remembering like a house on fire today you want me to lie still I think so okay no no where was I in love with Richard yeah we've been over this though I would like to go over it again well there it is then one day all of a sudden Wham he ditched me Susan everyone's personal life is unique and no one case is exactly duplicated but I do wish you'd keep telling yourself that almost every girl has been ditched at one time or another I know but to be ditched for

my business hi Murphy you precious pussycat mr. pride mr. pride I must ask you not to do that dr. record cannot be disturbed when she has a patient yeah I know all about that Murphy this is more than a social call Liz I'm sorry Susan but we just can't go on with that racket out there excuse me that's okay Liz honey it's Chris this is the most important day of my life but that matter it's the most important day of her life let me just explain to you Liz I won Chris I've asked you a hundred times please don't come in when I'm with a patient is Liz I'm trying to tell you something I won I won the

those patients that you're talking about you can give to other psychiatrists there are many psychiatrists in this town for that matter they're all in this building I know and I could probably work something out for most of my patients but well these three girls that what three girls well they're not progressing as rapidly as I would like and they all have the same problem and they depend completely on me I just can't leave them Chris I just can't Elizabeth what's the problem Chris I've been trying to tell you they've all three had very unhappy love affairs and there's gonna be a fourth Elizabeth they are in terrible shape I have a solution for you they feel rejected they won't go near men I have the answer for you Elizabeth get them off the couch put them back into circulation it's like the old thing about you fall off a horse Chris it's not that simple it is that simple Elizabeth I want to go to Paris and I want to take you with me I love you Elizabeth I'll see what I can do what's a minute ah so I'm not trying to get you to take him on oh he might say that Susan I want to ask you something you've been coming to me for a few months now do you feel any better oh sure I'm in great shape no I didn't mean that um do you have the feeling that you might be seeing your way clear to resolving your problem what problem men Oh huh need them Susan suppose I were to tell you um suppose that something came up that made it look as if I might have to go away what I would send you to another psychiatrist er a very good psychiatrist of course someone who would be kind and understanding you're going away well I just said I might you won't be here to talk to I'll be able to come see you it's just something I'm considering Elizabeth I don't care about the girls I only care about getting married and buy your own diagnosis I'm ready I'm cured I quit my job I'm an artist I even won a contest Elizabeth I am just completely secure and what happens you have to get stuck with three nutty females okay I'm sorry coots you won't go to Paris I won't go to Paris Chris you can't say that I did say it and I mean it Elizabeth but you have to go no I don't I'm gonna stay right here as a commercial artist and you know what's gonna happen I'm gonna grow to hate you Elizabeth then you're gonna feel rejected Elizabeth then I don't turn into insecurity then you'll need a psychiatrist now who I'd be the last one in the world to suggest that zoology is not a rewarding and exciting study if absolutely silent England but you know it isn't a complete life is it y'all gonna talk about man again you'll never raise a family in an animal compound at least insects have integrity Matt don't they uh-huh I suppose I've never had much contact with insects really Mary Lou I want

going away are you going away leave me oh well no III just said suppose I I think I'm feeling better don't you doctor yes Allah I think you are you know living abroad is exciting love it but I do have

Philadelphia I still laugh too much westerns you mean like western movies movies TV anything I watch them all the time the only thing is I root for the Indians now especially Just Cause but other

and I'm the happiest man in the world yeah what are you gonna do with the officers oh I'm subletting them too and I've adopted well what about Murphy it's just a with him that's strange what's strange Martini's for all Oh with the lady dr. burrows Thank You Stan for the man dr. sevinor sure yeah what were you saying what what's strange Oh something about San Francisco San Francisco hmm what about San Francisco yeah what about Sam just called it just bothers me but even though I know everything is all right yes when you please tell me what you're talking about well it seems strange to me that Susan's bow goes to San Francisco to visit an aunt and Mary Lou's bow goes to San Francisco to visit an aunt I mean that doesn't that sound strange to you Chris what are you doing oh it's okay Liz I'll drink it I'll help you oh yeah happy well now don't you think that sounds strange Wow what I just told you about San Francisco straining straining I don't think it's strange do you Chris no stress Noah and like I got to go along with Ben there's an awful lot of people that have ants in San Francisco as a matter of fact San Francisco was loaded with people's ants absolutely yeah you do you know that I read Liz yeah no no wait a minute Chris just a minute but both of these hands have hives well you know what I what I was going to say before Liz that I had bread this is the same thing that we were talking about that if you would take a poll of the men in Los Angeles in the specific economic bracket you would find that one out of every two have an aunt in San Francisco that has hives at least 80% with hives oh you too and that's a conservative estimate you know that's odd then I had a hunch that that estimate would be conservative your conservative with the boos oh sorry here we are San Francisco 13 please 11 you live in they make three of us hi miss nothing doctor asked me to be here five yes that's right but she asked me to be here at 5:00 yes you see also she asked I'm not to be here at 5:00 yes that's right she wants to see all three of you together yes oh you don't know each other I'm sorry here you are girls won't you come in well this is Susan Manning Mary Lou mold on a Jacque hi did just sit down anywhere girls as you can find a place I know you're all puzzled about this so I'll get to the point as quickly as possible to begin with you're all three patients of mine so I feel I can speak freely oh yes sure but doctor I feel all kind of funny inside I I sure wish you'd tell us what's the matter well probably nothing's a matter Mary Lou I just want to make certain about something would you tell me what your friend Rutherford looks like resident hmm well he's about six feet tall and he's sort of a medium weight and and you've got the nicest smile what color hair his hair is sandy colored I guess Susan what about Warren does he fit Mary Lou's description oh oh no Warren's a little taller and he has light brown hair I think Oh and rather furred wears glasses Oh Warren doesn't know does Ringo oh no he's a real western with plenty eyes and his hair is real dark black almost well not getting me very far is it I don't suppose any one of you has a picture of your friend no no well what is it that bothers you duh well the other day you told me that your friend Warren goes to San Francisco to visit a sick aunt right well Mary Lou didn't you tell me somewhat the same thing about Rutherford a short time ago well yes I did well is that all that's bothering your little ol here it's just a coincidence oh oh you're worried about them being the same person Oh doctor that's funny oh it is I mean we just we just gone and told you how different they all are why declare they just couldn't be any people in the whole world is different is Rutherford and these two ladies gentlemen friends honor does Ringo ever go to San Francisco yes he does but not to visit a sick aunt a sick horse well I guess you're right it must be a coincidence
