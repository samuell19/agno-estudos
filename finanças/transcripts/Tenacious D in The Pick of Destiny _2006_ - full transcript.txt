A long-ass fucking time ago In a town called Kickapoo There lived a humble family Religious through and through But there was a black sheep And he knew just what to do His name was Young JB And he refused to step in line A vision he did see Of fucking rocking all the time He wrote a tasty jam And all the planets did align Oh, the dragon`s balls were blazing As I stepped into his cave Then I sliced his fucking cookies With my long and shiny blade It was I who fucked the dragon Fucka lye, sing, fucka loo And if you try to fuck with me Then I shall fuck you too Gotta get it on In the party zone I got to shoot a load In the party zone Gotta lick a toad In the party zone Gotta suck a choad In the party zone You disobeyed my orders, son, Why were you ever born? Your brother`s 10 times better than you Jesus loves him more This music that you`ve played for us Comes from the depths of hell Rock & Roll`s the Devil`s work He wants you to rebel You`ll become a mindiess puppet Beelzebub will pull the strings Your heart will lose direction And chaos it will bring You better shut your mouth You better watch your tone You`re grounded for a week With no telephone Don`t let me hear you cry Don`t let me hear you moan You gotta praise the Lord When you`re in my home Dio, can you hear me? I am lost and so alone I`m asking for your guidance Won`t you come down from your throne? I need the tight compadre Who will teach me how to rock My father thinks you`re evil But, man, he can suck a cock Rock is not the Devil`s work It`s magical and rad I`ll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad I hear you brave young Jables You are hungry for the rock But to learn the ancient methods Secret doors you must unlock Escape your father`s clutches And this oppressive neighborhood On a journey you must go To find the land of Hollywood In the city of fallen angels Where the ocean meets the sand You will form a strong alliance And the world`s most awesome band To find your fame and fortune Through the valley you must walk You will face your inner demons Now go, my son And rock!

We`re gonna pay the rent... with our rock. -We are? -Yeah. But we`re not gonna be called the Kyle Gass Project. From now on, we will be known as Tenac. Tenac? What`s that? It`s a sign. A legacy. I`ve had this birthmark since I was born. I looked it up in the dictionary. It`s not in there. I never knew what the hell it meant. "Till now. It`s the name of our fuckin" band, dude. I have ass-mark too. You guys! Look! They must pay the rent With their rock But that`s my life. All right. Neil Hamburger, everybody. Neil Hamburger. Funny stuff. Uh, the next band asked me to read this. "Since the beginning of time it was written in the stones... that one day, a band would come. Well, that band has come, and now they`re here... to come again in your ear-pussies". Ladies and gentlemen, Tenacious D. That was awesome, the way you read that. Kage. Kage? Don`t forget to fucking bring the thunder. We`re Tenacious D and this is our first concert ever, so it`s kinda historical. And we wrote this song... that gives you a little taste of the history of the band. Let`s fucking do it, Kage, go! This is a song called The History Of Tenacious D. And it`s not just a list of bullshit that we`ve done in the past. It`s a chronicling of our rise to power! We ride with kings on mighty steeds Across the Devil`s plain We`ve walked with Jesus and his cross He did not die in vain We`ve run with wolves, we`ve climbed K2 We even stopped a moving train We`ve traveled through space and time My friends To rock this house again -We ride and we ride -We`ll never subside We`ll ride "till the planets collide And if you say that we do not ride I`ll tan your fucking hide, hide -Kyle`s fingers be silver -Jack`s voice then be gold But last you think we`re vain We know you`re all robots And we don`t care, Tenacious D We reign!

Let`s go! You guys, wait for me outside. I`m gonna go talk to the big cheese. Good call. So? What`d you think? It was OK. It was OK? You were OK. We were kick-ass. And we`re gonna totally win that money next week at the open mic contest. Well, good luck. You know there`s a lot of stiff competition, so... you might wanna think about writing some new material. That was amazing. You guys changed people`s lives tonight. I know, we were so awesome. Yeah, it was awesome. Compared to bullshit. But compared to the greats? To Zeppelin? To the Beatles? To fucking Beethoven? True. We were kick-ass. But if the D`s gonna win that prize money... we`re gonna have to write a fucking masterpiece! Are you with me? Totally. Power hug. Masterpiece. A masterpiece A masterpiece They`ve got to write a masterpiece To pay the rent Do it! All right, no more fucking around. Masterpiece is right in there. All we have to do is step into that magic circle... and the masterpiece is ours. Are you ready? Are you ready to write a fucking masterpiece? "Cause I sure the fuck am. Let`s go! Go, go, go! Play something. Go fast. The magic only lasts a second. No, don`t play fast. I said start fast. But keep going, yes. Try to make it prettier. Prettier, prettier. Prettier. Stop judging yourself, you`re judging yourself. That`s why that riff sucks. No fucking mental blocks. Release the... chi... That`s all right. Now, can you play a little higher, higher, higher up? Higher notes, higher notes. Higher notes. Higher notes, higher notes. Higher notes. Can you play any higher notes? Sorry. I didn`t mean to yell. I`m not looking for anything specific... but that`s definitely the wrong part of the cosmos. I want it over here, in the newer, hotter part. Molten lava! That`s the thing, keep playing that riff Because we gotta get it on tonight What are you doing? Were we recording? Press record. Press record. No! Don`t stop it, it`s too late! God damn it, Kyle, we had it. We were right there in it and you were too slow. You didn`t remember to do shit, you didn`t do what I told you... and things got crossed, chakras were fucking exploded. If we`re gonna do this thing right, you gotta do what I tell you to do! Do as I said! I wanna write a masterpiece. I know, dude. So do I. It`s all right. We`ve got writers" block, it happens to the best of "em. I mean, look at these guys. AC\DC, Van Halen, The Who! Why are you guys so awesome? What do you have that we don`t have? Well, they all use the same guitar pick. What? Looks like they all use the same guitar pick. Holy shitballs. Too many picks. Let`s see. I don`t think they have it. Let`s talk to the dude. We might have to special order it. Marcus, I need a price check on Ernie Ball amp caster stat. Just be a second. Can I help you, gentlemen? Yeah. We`re looking for a guitar pick like this one. How`d you hear about this? What did Papardello tell you? We just noticed that all these musicians are using the same guitar pick... Okay, just... Jerry, do me a favor... ring up these amp casters for me. Thank you, my man. In here. We can talk in here. What you seek... is the Pick... of Destiny. I think there`s a light switch back here. No, dude, you don`t... Grab a seat. You two bozos don`t even realize it but... you just stumbled onto the darkest secret in the history of rock. Go on. I actually saw it once. I used to be a guitar tech. So one night, I`m working a gig up in New Jersey or something. Some real mediocre band. Lead guitarist comes out, starts shredding licks... way beyond his capabilities. Like shit that had to be coming from somewhere else. I noticed he was using a new pick. Weird-looking thing with horns on it. Made of green ivory, or some shit. It was the pick, it wasn`t him. He didn`t know what he had, though. End of the show, he flicks it back into the audience. Some kid catches it. Kid named Eddie. Eddie? Van Halen! So I started researching it. Turns out this thing goes deeper than I could have imagined. Way deeper. Back to the Dark Ages. I moved to Rome. Quit my job. Learned Latin. I gained the trust of the night librarian at the Vatican. A gentleman named Salvatore Papardello. He turned me on to some shit that you wouldn`t believe. Check this out. It`s an ancient scroll. All in Latin. I translated it. Took me six years. Why didn`t you just get a translator? And let him read it too? Listen to this. Long ago, a dark wizard used his black magic to summon Satan himself. Satanus. That`s Latin for Satan. A horrific battle ensued. But the great demon was far too powerful. Snakes! Finish me, foul beast! Luckily, a blacksmith heard the beast`s roars. Fuck! You chipped my tooth. I`m not complete. What does that mean? From whence you came you shall remain... until you are complete again. Fuck you! No! No! I`m not complete! The demon was drawn back into the fires of hell... and the dark wizard was totally stoked to be alive. With a long draw on his hash pipe... the wizard devised a way to repay the blacksmith. The blacksmith loved a fair maiden. To gain her affection... he would need a true master skill... that would leave the maiden moist and wanting. And so the wizard fashioned the demon`s tooth into a pick... that would make the blacksmith play... only the most masterful of melodies on his lute... thereby winning the heart of the maiden he loved. The secret of the pick died with that blacksmith. And then... All of a sudden it reappears... in the American South, at the turn of the century, in Robert Johnson`s fingers. Spawns the birth of the blues. And rock & roll. -Of course. -The pick is a tiny part of the beast... so it has supranatural qualities. -Supernatural? -No, supra-natural. That`s like a whole other level above super. Where is it now? That`s the last known photo of the pick. That guitar was sold at auction. It now resides in the Rock & Roll History Museum. That`s where the POD is too. -The POD? -The Pick of Destiny. Why didn`t you just go get it? The Rock & Roll History Museum is an impenetrable fortress. You two bozos wanna steal the Pick of Destiny... count me out. I already went down that rabbit hole once. And I got news for you. There`s no cheese at the end of that tunnel, buddy. All right, get outta here. I told you enough already. C`mon, get outta here. Man, I don`t know what to say. Just get outta my store. The Quest! Oh, my God! You guys! What are you doin" here? Come on in! Actually, we can`t stay. We were hoping you`d do us a favor. Anything you need, man. -Do you think it would be OK... -We need your car. Well, kinda need it for work. Listen, man. We`ve got a meeting with the hugest president... of the most massive record company in the business. We need to meet him in Sacramento tonight. Well... All right. Hey, what`s up with this pedal? That`s my extra brake. I`m a pizza delivery guy and a driving instructor. I teach people how to drive while I deliver pizzas. Good thinkin", man. Later. Knock "em dead at the meeting, you guys. I can`t stop thinkin" about that fuckin" pick. You heard the guy. It`s Satan`s tooth. When we get that thing, we`re gonna win that fuckin" prize money... then we`re gonna dominate the world of rock. We`re gonna be unstoppable, man. Unstoppable. Unstoppable. Unstoppable. This next band asked me not to read this... but, God damn it, I`m going to read it anyway... because I wrote it and it`s the truth. "I fucking love this band!" They are the best band ever, period! Ladies and gentlemen... Tenacious D! Hey, what`s up? Me and KG wrote this song five minutes ago. It`s called Master Exploder. I do not need -He does not need -A microphone -A microphone -My voice is fucking -Fucking -Powerful I love you. Sorry. -I did not mean -He did not mean -To blow your mind -To blow your mind But that shit happens to me All the time Now, take a look -Take a look -Tell me what you see -What you see -We got the Pick Of Destiny JB! JB! JB! JB! JB! JB! JB! JB! JB! JB, wake up. JB, wake up! Let`s chow down, dude. I`m starving. OK. You guys know what you want? What do you recommend? I recommend that you order some food. OK. Lemme have the fried chicken... and a steak... and the chicken-fried steak. Hello. What happened to your eye? I burned it with a curling iron. I`ll have one small glass of carrot juice. -Yeah, we don`t have that here. -Then I will have nothing. Great. -Dude, what`s the matter? -Dude? Aren`t you hungry? -You should eat somethin". -No. I never eat before a mission. It slows you down. I gotta be light on my feet like a dancer. Like a fuckin" ninja, dude. Now check this out. I`m gonna jump this fence here, OK? Like a gazelle. Then you come around that fuckin" bend. God! Damn it, Kyle! If we`re gonna do this, you gotta stay focused. Eye of The Tigre! Now check it out. You give me a fuckin" boost, He-Man style. And then we`re gonna fuckin" do a little mini-tiger roll... And come on back. I fuckin" pull your shit up. Dude, hold on. That`s good stuff. Fuckin" dick squeezer. Buddy. So... what brings you to this neck of the woods? We`re just on a little business trip. Are you going to check out the Rock & Roll History Museum? The Rock & Roll what? -History Museum. -Oh, no. I don`t even know what you`re talkin" about. You just seem like Rock & Roll types to me. Yeah, well, we`re not. We`re just two fuckin" businessmen... on our way to see some shit in Sacramento. So, sorry. I was just asking because I noticed... the guitars in the back seat of your car. Well, I said we`re fuckin" businessmen. We sell guitars. So what? Big deal. End of story. Check, please! Sure you aren`t planning on breaking into the Rock & Roll History Museum? Hey, gimme that back, man! Yeah, my buddy and I are in a band. I don`t like to say the name, but we had some hits... and so they`re inductin" us into the Rock & Roll History Museum. No way! -Way. -Oh, my God. We`re sitting with someone famous? We`re just regular guys. I mean, we`re just flesh and bone. Let`s just say you are planning on breaking into... the Rock & Roll History Museum. Maybe you are inexperienced and you get inside and cry like little girl. Maybe you don`t have what it takes to get the job done. "Scuse me. Damn. God. I was thinking... maybe there was something in that museum... you had a desire for. Maybe... Pick of Destiny! Our sorority is throwing a huge bash tonight. You guys should totally come and play some of your songs at the party. We`re just getting ready to head over there right now. Why don`t you follow us over? You know what? That sounds rad. We don`t usually play private parties but... I think we can make some dreams come true tonight. I`ll ride along with you. So you don`t get lost. I tried to get the Pick of Destiny once. I had it in my hands, too. But I was caught. Set off a laser. Security door came down on my leg. Cut it right off. I would break in again if I still had my leg. My leg. Oh, man. I miss that sweet-ass leg of mine. Why are you telling me this? I like you. I see the spark in your eye that I once had. Let me show you something. These are my plans. They will help you, I promise. There are two air ducts on the roof. You must enter through there. Speak of this to no one! Wait. Wait, I have some questions. Let me wipe. Hold up, dude. Dude. I got some smokin" bettys over there... and they want us to play a gig. No. I just had the weirdest conversation of my life. This guy just gave me the perfect plan. Now, look. There`s two air ducts on the roof. Dude. The party? Gettin" to play our own tunes? That blonde over there... wants to ride my wrinklestick, yo. Would you get your head out of the fuckin" pussy-clouds, man? Who cares about these chicks? There`s gonna be ten times hotter babes backstage... when we win album of the year. This pick is our ticket to genius. Dude. I can`t believe you`d pass by a gig opportunity... with some sweet-ass hotties. What, for this? Is this really that important to you? Huh? We can still write a masterpiece and win that dough. Maybe it would be better for the D if we worked on our songwriting... instead of relying on ancient bullshit, but... probably won`t work anyway. What`s it gonna be, Kyle? You have to decide. Tits or destiny? Tits. So, good luck, buddy. I hope it was worth it, because we`re done. You ruined it. Pick`s mine. Fuck you. I don`t fuckin" need you. Later... cock-ass! Don`t mind him. He`s my butler. Had to let him go for loafin". He`ll be fine. Excuse me, are you gonna charge us for all the refills? No, you`re so pretty, you get everything for free. Well, that`s a really good deal. Why? It`s just a five-mille walk. I can walk that. I don`t need a car. I`ll take the fuckin" shoelace express. Fuck you! Where we goin"? Stop. Stop the music. Everybody, we have got a special surprise tonight. We have brought with us... someone who just happens to be a rock star! That`s in town to be conducted... into the Rock & Roll History Museum. And he promised to come here tonight and play us a few of his hits. So let`s give it up! I don`t have a guitar. I don`t have a guitar. This is a song... I wrote with my partner. My former partner. And it`s called The History Of Tenacious D. Across the Devil`s plain He did not die in vain No That sucked. One more and that`s it. It`s a good thing I found these mushrooms. I was fucking starving. This place is kinda... juicy. Oh, my God! Sasquatch! Jables! What`s up? What are you doin" out here?

Now, just let me hold it for one second! You`re never gonna use this fuckin" pick. You guys, the crowd`s gettin" restless in there. What`s goin" on? What`s wrong? We can`t go on. We had the demon`s pick... but then we broke it, and now our masterpiece will never happen. We can`t pay the rent because we won`t be fueled by Satan. Come on, come on. Get up, come on. You`re all right. You guys... having some satanic guitar pick isn`t gonna make your rock any better... because Satan`s not in a guitar pick, he`s inside all of us. He`s in here. In your hearts. He`s what makes us not want to go to work, exercise... or tell the truth. He`s what makes us want to party... and have sex with each other all night long. He`s that little voice in your mind that says, "Fuck you" to the people you hate. Now, you can stay out here and fight on the ground, and cry like babies. Or you can go in there like friends... and rock. So, what`s it gonna be? Let`s go in there and show "em what Tenacious D is all about. Yeah. I already got a guitar pick anyways. C`mon. Dude, we can still use the pick. You use one half, I`ll use the other. There`s still some juice in there, probably. You know what I mean? Where is that...? I am complete Fuck! Yes, you are fucked Shit out of luck Now I`m complete And my cock you will suck This world will be mine And you`re first in line You brought me the pick And now you shall both die Wait, wait Wait, you motherfucker We challenge you To a rock-off Give us one chance To rock your socks off Fuck!

Good call. Take it to the head, bitch. Draws like a pencil. Press record. Now let`s rock it. One, two, three. "Cause it`s the Pick of Destiny Child You know we will be rockin" "Cause it`s fuckin" insane It`s just the Pick of Destiny Child More precious than a diamond On a platinum chain In Venice Beach There was a man named Kage When he was buskin" He was all the rage He met Jables And he taught him well All the techniques That were developed in Hell Cock push-ups And the power slide Gig simulation Now there`s nowhere to hide They formed a band They named Tenacious D And then they got The Pick of Destiny "Cause it`s the Pick of Destiny Child You know we will be rockin" "Cause it`s fuckin" insane It`s just the Pick of Destiny Child Our tasty grooves are better Than a chicken chow mein "Cause he who is sleazy Is easy to pleasey And she who is juicy Must be loosey-goosey And he who is groovy Will be in my movie So come on The wizard and the demon Had a battle royal The demon almost killed him With an evil kapow But then it broke his tooth And thus the demon said, "Ow!"
