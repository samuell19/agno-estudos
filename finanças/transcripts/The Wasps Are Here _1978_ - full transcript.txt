See how nice this spot is! It’s great. - Beautiful, isn't it? - It is. Those over there are the islands. - Come, let’s get changed. - Fantastic, bro. Help to take those stuffs. Hold this. Bro, it’s a great place. It’s very hot though. It’s because you just came. But it will be very cold when the off-season winds come. - Francis! - Coming, Sir. It’s great, bro. Here, look. Isn’t it lovely? - Is it cold? - Must you always have it cold to drink? What’s there to eat? There’s some big prawns, Sir. I can fry some seer fish too. Here, do you eat that stuff? Just wait and see. We must get down to work tomorrow. The business took a hit after Father got sick. Francis can’t do business with these folks. These people must have made a mint from the fish business. - Isn’t it? - Yes. - Francis! - Sir? How many boxes were packed yesterday? Only 120. There was space in the lorry, but there was no more fish. Why, there was no fish? Anton has now cornered the market, unlike in your father’s time, when we usually get most of the fish. Remember? We were just talking about Anton on our way here. He was walking around Puttalam area once. Whisked away a beautiful girl for himself… He built a house like a mansion on another island. What a romantic fellow. You don’t know, Sir. He has as many women as there are islands, and countless children. Nobody dares to go against his word. Everybody fears him. It will be the end of him if he goes to the wrong side. Drink. They come like dogs here on this coast… Who is there to beat Anton on the beach, eh? Right? Drink, men! Is that enough for you? Enough… Drink… drink… Theresa! You’d better be careful. The wasps are here! - The wasps, eh? - Wasps. Wasps. Peduru Mudalali is nearing his end. That’s why the Little Master has been sent here. He will go with sand in his mouth! How can these city folk do business on this beach, bro? We are ready for anything. Yeah! Put ice into the fish bags and load them to the lorry. Okay. Oh… I’m sleepy. OK, I will take a nap with her! Anton bro! Come after taking a nap. We are going. The lorry should be here now. Selestina! I wanted to see you. Ask Christopher to come over here. Tell him that I asked. Hey! Isn’t that Helen? It’s not easy to recognise. And how about you, Little Master? You’ve grown taller than your father! Mom! Excuse us, Master. We are going, it’s late. OK. She is very beautiful, bro. She’s pretty, all right. Many here must be eyeing her up. It’s not hard to make a move on her. But I must do it on the sly. They are very bad people. OK, untie. Let’s go, Benja! OK. Keep it here. How many boxes of fish did you pack? 32 from the church square and there are about 12 here. Tell Joseph and Baby Ayya not to go after every person. There’s enough money to buy the fish this time. There’s a message from Michael. Sir, we’ll have a look at Michael’s spot too. All right. Oh, it’s you Little Master! How’s your father? Not getting any better. Michael! How are you, Little Master? How are you? Are you earning well? Not very much, Little Master, we only have about 100 kilos of tuna fish. Hello, Little Master. Is it true that your father is very ill? Yes, he will have to stay in bed for a month or two. Michael, how much is the whole lot? I just promised the Little Master, Anton sir. Then why the hell did you send me word? Excuse me, Little Master, some bastards only need my help in times of trouble. If you want the lot, then take it. No, I don’t want it. I stand by my word. Francis, see if there’s anything more to buy. I’ll settle them when I come back. Hmm, let’s go. Aunt Selestina, get me some tea. Check whether the water is boiling. What is this? A tub wouldn’t be enough for you! Would a cup be enough in this hot weather? Do you also want tea? Since you’re asking... We'll drink if you bring it to us. I wish to buy you two gold bangles for the church feast. As if my body is covered with all the gold you have given me. You and your fibs. Don’t you remember? When you were a kid, I bought you some bangles from a Muslim peddler. Don’t talk rubbish, and drink your tea. Next month, I’ll buy a motorboat. Helen, wait and see. I’ll cover this whole beach with fish. Remember how the priest used to punish you for boasting. Little Master wanted to see you earlier. His father must be in a bad state… Hello, Little Master, I got your message asking me to come. I’ll be here for a few months because my father is ill. I need your help. Help from us? I’ve settled well here, thanks to your father. It’s very hot. Let’s go to our huts. Little Master is very handsome, isn't he, Mother? What’s the matter with you? His father was more handsome and no lass was spared from his good looks. Weren't you beautiful in those days? Shut up! It’s very hot. I don’t think you are used to this. Little Master should be used to this. If we live here, we’ll end up looking like dried fish. Christopher, you get me the fish. I'll give you the commission. It’s difficult to get past Anton. Even the Muslim merchants fear him. There are few merchants buying from Anton. They are able to pay for the fish cash down. Tell the rest I‘ll pay cash down too. I’ll give you a part of the profit. Or ask them to start an auction. Anton can bid at the auction. Anton has control over the Muslim merchants and he intimidates the fishing folk. Ah, tea for Little Master. Selestina, send Helen here to prepare some tea. Why are they sending you? Ask your mother to prepare the tea. Why shouldn't I go? You are jealous. I’m not free to go… unless I tie up things. So much tea! There’s a gallon here. - This is for you. - Ah, good. You are a grown woman now. I couldn't even recognise you that day. How about you, Little Master? You got a beard like your father’s. Your church feast is due soon? Would you stay that long? Much longer. Why? Wouldn’t you like me to stay? Goodness me. Why wouldn’t I? How are you, Cyril? Just getting by, Little Master. What did the Little Master say? What does he have to say to me? Why did you rush to make tea for him? Why shouldn't I? I’d put in two spoons of sugar for him. Hello, where does Peduri Mudalali’s son live? He’s the one who came from the city. At the extreme end of the camp. - Over there? - Yes. Thank you very much. Hey, come, come. Hey! How did you get here? By bus? Yeah man, I didn’t come. The bus brought me here… By a crawling express bus. You must be tired. Have a whiskey. That’s a good idea. This is like a room in Cinnamon Garden. When you mentioned it’s a fishing camp… I thought you’d be fishing for real. You must be tired. Go and have a wash. Francis! Francis! Sir! - Get some water ready. - Yes, Sir. You have spoilt… …these surroundings. You should have decorated this place… with seashells and corals. This has the ugly beauty of a cheap cake. Water is ready, Sir. Go on then. I don’t have a sarong. I’ll give you one. Give me one that doesn’t stink. I feel free, like this beach and the sea. A deep, even and straight life. It’s like the beginning of civilization. The land and sea belong to everyone. Nudity should be the national dress. But you would be against it. See how beautiful it is. It’s hot, the sea itself boils. Surely, these people are not fond of this life. Their lives here have a different meaning from what you are looking for. They love the sea. You don’t love the sea, nor the folk. You think above them. Not that Victor’s life is not precious to him. Now he wants to live here. I bet there must be a beauty somewhere on the beach… a married woman, perhaps. I have fallen for somebody. She is good even to marry. But he doesn’t want to marry. He just wants a bite and then leave. That’s part of your culture. Yes, go on robbing them of their freedom, their labour and destroy their private life! Pull, pull. Are you pulling?

Shut up, wait till I bid and get it! 55 second call. If you are going to buy, bid till the last sprat, Master. I told you once, I don’t want small fish. Banjo, you’d better cook and eat it yourself. - Where is Christopher? - He went to the store to buy kerosene. Have a seat, Little Master. Will he be back soon? Where’s your mother? She went to the beach. She should be home soon. Is it confirmed that you are getting married soon? Rubbish! What nonsense! Everybody is saying so. What else can they say? Why? Don’t you like Cyril? I don’t know, Little Master. Leave my hand… I love you, Helen. I can’t leave this place after seeing you. Mother, Little Master is here. What does he want? I don’t know. Yes, Little Master. I came to meet Christopher. He went to the store. - Ask him to come and meet me. - OK. - Why did Little Master come here? - To meet Father. Don’t fool me. He’s here to see you, not your father. Why would he come to see me? Bees gather around flowers. Bees gather around flowers to drink. You are jealous. Don’t let him continue these visits. My goodness! You are annoyed. Helen! Promise me Helen… You are the most beautiful woman among our folk. I want to marry you. We’ve been together since our childhood. This is the spot. Let’s peek. They got the stuff, they're drinking it. Let’s ask them. They may share it with us. We are looking for some nice toddy. Toddy. This is not the time for toddy. We only have some arrack. - We’ll leave then. - Where can you go at this time? Seba, bring some arrack. Gentlemen, how much do you want? Arrack… you bugger. Sit. You’re staying at Little Master’s camp, right? Today you must drink on my account. No… we drink on our account! Yes, on our account. That’s Brother Anthony for you… a jolly good fellow. We know about Brother Anthony. What do you know about him? You'll get to know him more later. - Francis! - Sir? Bring me something to drink. Where did the gentlemen go? They didn't tell me, Sir. We eat, drink, cheer, move among people... Isn't it so, Seba? Why not? - Drink up, Cyril! - OK, Brother Anthony. Shall we leave, Weera? - Victor must be looking for us. - What nonsense. You must have another drink. Seba, open the other bottle. We’ll get together again, Brother Anton. Another day, perhaps? Good night. Good night, Sir. I can’t let you go like that. I’ll escort you. That’s not necessary, Brother Anton. No, we can manage. Sir. We can manage, Brother Anton. Listen to me, Sir. Please don’t bother. We’ll meet another day, Brother Anton. Wait a minute, Sir. Listen to me. Don’t get mad. But whatever Anton says goes. I swear on Virgin Mary, there’s nobody else here who can outtalk Anton. Don’t we know that! You gentlemen came over and now you must come with us. We are all human. There‘s no difference between us. That's right. Sir, what you say is true. We are prepared to do anything for your sake, gentlemen. I already know that! Sir, you are fine! Brother Anton, come in! Rosa, bring a club to kill the dog. Rosa, bring a club to kill the dog. To run on both legs that God has given. Rosa, bring a club to kill the dog. Rosa, bring a club to kill the dog. Rosa, bring a club to kill the dog. To run on both legs that God has given. Rosa, bring a club to kill the dog. Why did you turn it off? Put it back on, we are in the mood. Don’t upset it, Sir! Come Anton, let’s go. Let go of me! Why don’t you listen to him? Go, Brother Anton. So, is Little Master showing his superiority? We are not as powerful, but we won’t stand for this. Listen to me. Let’s go. We didn't come for their fucking stuff. Bastard! Eh! What did you say? I can say what I want! Go to hell! He thought he came out from the elephant’s arse! Bloody Little Master or his mother’s fucking man… If anyone lays his hands on me, I’ll smother the life out of him! I’m the son of Lazarus, remember that! Neither you nor your damn father can ever touch me! Come on, man. Nobody can beat me on this beach. Let me go! You are mean, Victor. They are also human. Why the hell did you go drink with them? I would have brought some toddy if you had told me. Those fellows are no good company for you here, Sir. Shut up! You can’t even stand your own people? With all these, my dope has gone. Now, I need another drink. What about you? Mother! Is it true that the Little Master and Anton nearly came to blows? I’d expected it after what happened at the fish auction. Anton is only a loudmouth, Mother. He won’t let this go easily though. The Little Master will let him have it. Keep your mouth shut. Anton is a man of our soil. Little Master has come to stay for a long time. How do you know? He said so. If the son does what the father did, it's unnatural. You take care of yourself! That’s a hell of a joke. Why should I care? - Mother. - Yes? Little Master said that he loves me. That he loves you? What did you say? I didn't say anything. You will fall into trouble. Remove those feelings if it is there. Remember, you are promised to Cyril. He'll kill himself if something happens. Everybody thinks that this has been decided. Why are you alone today? Where's your mother? Mother went to see Aunty Matilda. Aren't you going to Palliyawatta today? - Will you be at home? - Why are you asking? I'll tell you when I come. Will you be there? It's getting late, I must go. On which islet does Anton keep his mistress Mary? At the extreme end. She is a good woman, Sir. She even has a child now. I always have him in mind. She gives me a cup of tea when I go there. Doesn't she give you anything else? She is not a bad woman, Sir. I still love her and would go visit her. Does Anton know about this? He knows it, but he trusts her. She is his favourite woman. Where's your father? They went to the auction. Don't you feel dull and alone in this desolate place? I have no choice. I should be on this beach. You seem lost in this place. The city would be a better place for you. Wouldn’t you like that? You are just teasing me. A long time ago, Mr Peter was like that too. My mother was born on this soil too. I love you. I will take you away with me. Sir. There’s a boat in sight! It must be Christopher or Cyril! Christopher, I came to see you. I went to Palliyawatta. I got back late. Have you had any luck? I've had no fish for two days. - Let me know if there’s any available. - Yes, Little Master. I will be off. Tell me the truth, Helen. Why did he come? Why are you silent, you think I don't understand? Let go of my hair! Out with it, you dirty bitch! You slept with that man? Wait until I get my hands on him. I swear by God, I'll kill him! What the hell happened? Little Master has ruined her. She has raised her cloth and offered herself! I will kill all of you, I swear to God! Is this true? Speak! Yes. What's the meaning of this? How can I face the people? You need not. I will face, I will answer anyone. Shut up, bitch! You talk too much! We must get a gold chain for our son. I don't want to bring up the little chap in this hell. I'll send him to town to my brother Laus. How can I live here alone without my child? You don't need to live here. I'm waiting till the Little Master goes away. He's playing all sorts of tricks with his money. Let’s see about that. Bring me something to drink. Load those up! Where the hell is the other lorry? Tell Abdullah Mudalali that if he doesn't send the lorry on time, he won't be able to buy fish from this beach hereafter. Abdullah Mudalali said it's no longer profitable to buy fish from this beach. Fish prices have gone up ever since Little Master came here. Tell this Abdullah that the prices will come down soon. If not, we will bring it down. Gulp it down, Cyril. Today we must drink to glory! Out in the boundless ocean, a shark or whale is nothing. This Little Master is only a bloody sprat. People who were more powerful than him have tried to take over this beach. Some of them are still slumbering beneath the sands or at the bottom of the sea. I swear on my mother that I'll make the swine bite the dust! Who? That Victor! I will ground him. He destroyed me. I won’t hide it to you, Brother Anton. You are the only folk I can talk to now. Victor seduced Helen, when she was alone in the hut. He raped her? - No, he enticed her into it. - Wasn't she promised to you? I had great hopes, Brother Anton. Now all that is washed away... That dirty bitch. That rascal will take her to city like his father did. He's sure to give her the slip. I cannot let him do that. I swear to God, I'll kill him! You just wait. I'll take care of everything. Come men, hurry up and pack these in. You'll have to move this lorry to the side. The lorry? You’re in a hurry? Yes, I want to move quickly. I swear to God, I will buy it if it can be sold. Where is your Little Master? Ask him to come here and show his face! Reverse the lorry, damn it! If that lorry is moved, I can drive along the side. Take it back! The fish will get spoilt, Sir! Take that back, pig! Have some pity, Brother Anton! Pity? Do you hold his arse for him? Stop that, Cyril! Look here, Cyril! Have you turned into a thug now? Come alone and challenge if you can! Why do we do this? For whom? For the kids! - For whose kids? - Other people's kids. Sir, look what has happened. They blocked the way, so our lorry can't move! Won't they allow you to pass through? No Sir, and Cyril even tried to stab me. Get in! What's the meaning of this dirty work, Anton? What "dirty" work? "Dirty" is the proper word for what you do. What’s the “dirty” work that I did? Don’t be mad. Whatever you did to Selestina's daughter. How lovely! Go to hell, Little Master! What business is it to you whoever I do it with? - It's Anton's business. You bastard! - Hold it, Cyril. You took out that sword to hack me? Go ahead! Yes, I will cut you! I didn't take her by force. Unlike you, who’s taking women by dozens to the islets! Is it dirty only if I do it? It’s true that I have women all over the islets. I don't poke and run away, I treat them well! Nor will I run away! Hold it, Victor. Let's go. They think they own this place by right! Is what they say true? What? That you slept with Helen? Yes, but only with her consent. But you didn't tell us? One shouldn't be selfish! She's not a prostitute for all to share. Moreover, I love her. We didn’t need to share. Someday, you'll abandon her on this sandy beach. She'll be deserted. I won't leave her behind. Let’s see what will happen when she bears a child for you. It’s great. I've never taken anything by force. There's absolutely no fun in it. She may have been deceived by your good looks. You must have promised her the sun and the moon. Including children, so she will not be alone. Our good friend, what you've done is bad. We are just visitors here. This is their land. They must have the freedom to decide what's good for them. You can never be one of them. You'll surely get her into trouble. INTERMISSION Cyril, go on. Helen, I've got nothing against you. I'll forgive you. I'll explain the matters to your parents. Let me help, give me the axe. Give it to me. No, I don't need your help. I never thought you'd treat me like this. Some folks may think that I get only chewed up betel. It doesn't matter to me. You can take another woman. I can't forget you, Helen, even though you could. We grew up and played on the beach together. Let go of me! Wait, will you... When are you going on your honeymoon? Wouldn't it be great to travel in a car with Little Master? Helen, who’d have thought that you'd fall prey so soon? Put an end to your flirting. Anton Ayya, go away. Don't poke your fingers into people's affairs. Stop pretending to be virtuous... especially after what happened to you. Helen, you’d better look where you’re heading. I'll go where I want to, that's none of your business. Do you think you're Queen Victoria and you can do as you please? You must stop this nonsense. Hold it there! You must stop the affair with Little Master, or my name isn’t Anton! Let me go! Such brave fellows, you dare call yourselves men? I swear on Virgin Mary that if you try to be funny... we'll perform the last bloody rites for your little Victor! Go ahead, kill me! Why do you want to kill somebody else? Chop me up! Shut your bloody mouth, you foolish bitch! Bastards! Francis! Sir. Who's going onto the fish lorry today? Peter, Sir. I need to go somewhere else. When the other lorry comes, you send the remainder of the fish. Yes, Sir. Will you come with me? To that islet. I will stay with people on it for four days to relax in complete freedom! Oh, not me! That beauty will finish in one day. Control your stools. You will get all 3 meals. Once I spent the whole day on a boat. Fried mackerel and sambal... was my main meal. How delicious it was! Why man, there's enough mackerel here! Ask Francis to make sambal and eat to your heart's content. You don’t need to roam about here and there for that. You'll never understand this. Your heads are like empty tin cans. Hmm, yes... I'll be back soon. This midnight jaunt can't be anything but a wayward one. I know where you're going. Don't wait for me for dinner. OK. I don't like what he's doing. He won't listen. I won't be surprised if he gets stabbed. Sir, Master wouldn’t listen... or else why would he go out at this ungodly hour? Do you know where he’s going? Must be to Helen's. That Cyril is waiting like the devil with a knife in his hands. What if he stabs him? Ah, the Little Master! Why this sudden visit? I think you already know everything. I want to talk to Helen. The Little Master says he wants to meet this girl. What do you say to that? This is nonsense! Now he has come to meet! Go on, you damn slut! Get out there, will you? Francis told me everything. I'm not afraid of anyone. I'm scared they'll do something to you. Anton is a dangerous man. What can they do to me? You should be careful, Helen. They must be watching us. How can we meet again? I won't go to the fishing huts anymore! We can still meet somehow. I'll send Francis. I have fears, Little Master. Why fear? What if somebody sees us? They have come to know about the other night. Cyril had reproached Mother about it. What did she say? Nothing. But I informed Mother before coming here. She didn't try to stop you? No, but she asked me to do it openly, and not to hide. Hiding not because of fear. They'll forget everything in few days. Be careful, Little Master. Do you want to kill yourself? It's good to die... but not alone! I see! You want to kill yourself and me at the same time! You’re boozed up like a fish! You are drunk! You bastard! I won't spare you! I’ll kill you! You've ruined me! My love You are you I am not you, and You are not me I will rest in that knowledge One day if you understand me One day if you understand me My love You are you I am not you, and You are not me I will rest in that knowledge One day if you understand me One day if you understand me One day if you understand me One day if you understand me In the breath of a moment The scorching heat arrives After the bitter cold Is there anyone here who knows something about this death? Who first saw the body washed ashore? I think… he knows. Why are you muttering? Who came here first? My friend Pedro was out at the bog and found the body, sir. Who last saw Cyril before he died? He came to my place at about 9 last night. He had a drink with me and left. He was in great mental distress. What was it about? Woman trouble, sir. He was at daggers drawn with the Little Master. I don't hide anything, I only say what I know. That's Victor. What was the cause of the trouble? Now it's all over. Cyril kept a knife to stab Little Master. What if we ask Little Master about it? I saw him at about 2 a.m. Like a grist he went swaying about and set out to sea on a boat. I had come out because of sleeplessness. That’s not a time to go out to sea! All because of his drunkenness! I swear on my mother. I think it was past 2 o’clock at night. He got to the boat over there. And there’s the boat that washed in. Anthony, I want to have a word with you. See me at noon. OK, Sir. Let's go bathing. I can't. I'll bathe later. Sir, Cyril died last night. Cyril died? His body was washed ashore. What a shame, that innocent man! Maybe he jumped into the sea. He was heartbroken. Old Man Pedro had seen him going away in the dead night. I think he went out in sheer drunkenness, not to lay the nets. You're lucky they don't know you’d beaten him up. So what if they know? I didn't kill him! That I know well! Mr. Victor, you must have learned about Cyril's death. It's not part of my duties, but since there isn’t a police force here, I’d have to report it. Sit down, please. According to my information, Cyril and you did not get on well. Yet, I'm not sure this is a case of suicide. There should be a reason even for suicide. I just want to find out some basic facts about the case. I think Anthony would have given you all the details. I have an affair with a girl called Helen... That's the reason for Cyril's hostility. When did you last met him? Yesterday. At about what time? About midnight. I was driving in my jeep. He jumped onto the road, narrowly avoided being hit. Earlier he had tried to attack me with a knife. He was waiting to catch me alone. After the Little Master grabbed his knife, Cyril hit him with a pole. My God! Was he hurt? The Little Master got hold of the pole and gave Cyril a couple of blows. He was close to us like our own child... Wait till I get at you! It was you who killed him. I'll smother your head if you take one step outside this hut, you bitch! I don't know how all these will end... Anton is a very dangerous chap. He has a bad temper. I'll see you again if necessary. Alright. Lord thou art in heaven. We do hereby consign the soul of Cyril the loyal servant at thy care. Let him prosper in thy service... Let him rest in peace... Amen! I can't bear this! He was a good-hearted chap. He’s always the first to come forward and volunteer for anything. What else can we say, Anton? It's all God's will! What bloody nonsense. God's will, my arse! They beat him up and killed him! Francis, damn you! Go tell your master that Anton won't let this off easily! You shitty dogs! You bastards, I'll chop you to pieces! He was killed! Beaten up and killed! I won't let them be! They killed him! Hey, Francis! Francis! Let's go. Don't you know? He did no harm to anyone. He earned an honest living and lived with us on this beach. But he was killed like a dog and thrown out to the sea. Don't you know who killed him? Do you know? Why did you come here? Go home! There's an unacceptable truth in what they say. They say you killed Cyril because you were the root cause to his death. I didn't want to get rid of him! What if I was killed instead? However, this was a suicide, not a murder. In any case, why don't you head back home? Then I’d be labelled guilty of murder. Regardless, these people are not on your side. You have just become their enemy. Except ourselves, everything here belong to them. Because of you, they have lost one of their women. Then, a man whom they love died! They feel that deep down! Sir, Anton incited the people at the funeral. He told them we killed Cyril. People are upset. Anton is coming with those people. - They’re coming here? - Yes, Sir! - What shall we do? - Leave it to me. Don't be mad! Try to avoid them. You can't afford to clash with them! All of you should leave, Sir. Why get involved here? If I don't remain here they will destroy this place. Francis! Close this up, I'll be back soon. Yes, Sir. What’s with an army like this, Anton? Out to wage a war? Unlike you, we have no army and weapons. - So they just followed you here? - Yes, Sir. Why did you come here? I'll go away, Sir. They will go too. But God shall be witness to this. This is terribly unjust. These fellows killed Cyril! Beat him up and killed him! P.O. What shall we do, Brother Anton? Every dog here is an arse licker to those outsiders. They are powerful. Everyone is on their side and our man fell an easy victim! Don't think you have absolved yourself from the blame. That's what I thought! My father was also a man of this soil. I have a right to this place too. Sir, those fellows are leaving meekly. Shut up, you fool! I am very sad, Little Master, when I think about Brother Cyril. I feel like my heart is burning. I never thought that Cyril is such a fool. I always have this fear in my mind. It’s not easy to escape from these bad people. A heavy branch can break down fast. Which branch? The branch that I am on. Who told you that? - Aunt Matilda. - What else doesn’t she talk about? Are you really taking me away with you? Yes. When? Someday. Little Master should be careful. I don't let myself be seen these days. It's getting late. I'm going. What shall we do now? What can we do now? Keep a low profile, as Weera has advised you. You're like the deer in heat, heavy and blind with desire. Wealth and sexual lust too. What's going to happen to Helen? I bet you're neither staying here with her nor taking her away with you! You shouldn't bet on it now... Either of these options is possible. Tomorrow I'll be going with Francis to one of those remote islets. I'll stay there for 3 or 4 days. I'm telling this for your own good. Don't worsen matters. Francis? Sir! Please... Francis... What's the matter? There's blood on you. Please. I... Anton has died at my hands! Anton died? Yes, Sir. I didn't think of killing him. It just happened. I hacked him to death. That means you've killed him! What the hell have you done, man? You wretch! What the hell... What do we do now? Please, tell Mr. Victor to save me. I'll stay here before they come to take me away. I’ll hide near those palm trees or else they'll butcher me. Please! I hacked him to death while he was asleep. If he’d been awake he would have slaughtered me with his axe. I was frightened. Shut up, you fool! Let's see how you will be saved. Hey, Francis! Get down! Do you think you can get away after killing Anton? Get down! You will be killed no matter where you are. The one who died was Anton! There are others to look after! Francis, get down! I think he won't come down. Wait. You won’t get down? Cut it down! Little Master is coming. That’s enough now. Run! It’s a pity we couldn't arrive a minute sooner. I feel very sad. He grew up with us in our house. Now what's to be done? You're asking me? The best thing to do now is to get back home. Yes, go home! That is all you can do now. I didn't think Francis would be so foolish, I feel so sorry for him. You may feel sorry for him. What about Anton? Cyril? That's just the way it is! These deaths are all... look at it that way: There's a fundamental cause for all these. And what is that? You! Francis died because of you, to free you. Anton and Cyril died because of you. Shut up, Weera. I'm not a murderer. No, you didn't kill them! It's your way of life. Wijesinghe and Oliver. You’ll have to stay back. Yes. We can't touch the bodies until we get police instructions. Let's go. I've stationed two officers here. Mr. Caldera! You've informed the police? Yes, I've already given them a radio message. The police will occupy this place in a day or two. They have already chosen a house. So, the police are also coming here? Yes. - Are they bringing back both bodies? - They can't leave them there. Excuse the delay. I have to talk to you. There they've come. Ask the gentleman what happened, Sir? What do you all want to know from me? What happened? And what I saw? I saw how free you were. I saw your strength! The way you own the sea and the land, and the way you share all this. Your word is the law. Your own free government, as if at the beginning of a civilization. A state of pure, primitive communism. Then I saw how people came and exploited you! Your own blood! You don't understand? I’ll teach you to understand these. You have been isolated by the other world, left alone and desolate. You have been marginalized. Don't fear. After this, you won't be left alone. You will get the government’s protection. Yet, your power lies not in cutting up people, and allowing others to exploit you, but in rising against exploitation somehow! I'll meet you later. You must have heard what happened. The people say we are to be blamed for all this. Let them say whatever they want. I'll be away for a while, but I'll be back. Then, what about me? What did Little Master say? Nothing. Where are you bound to, Sir? Is this bus about to go? Where are the passengers? The police have gone to bring the bodies back. They are only concerned of such matters. Right! Right! The sea turned into earth The burning sun shines The goddess of the tree cries The burning sun shines THE END
