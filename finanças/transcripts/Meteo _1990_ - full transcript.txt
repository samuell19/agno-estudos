Ecker? It's me, are you there? Listen, I called you to tell you that we're gonna do it. We'll lake the bathtub and all, don't be afraid, you'll be coming with me, alright? I'm going right to your place, wait for me! We'll be doing this last thing and then we'll fly away. The factories are out of use now. In the following weeks officials begin to liquidate the now unused quarters. Demolitions are to be performed every day at noon. Rubble removal will be completed by tomorrow noon. All illegal dwellers of the buildings should move out immediately. Headquarters do not take responsibility for any physical harm that should occur on the premises. At the same time... Alright, are we off? Yep. I'm staying. Tired as hell. Let's get the hell outta here. Little Cloud, where're you? I'm gonna devour you, my fairy! Gee, Little Cloud! Eckerman, listen! Can you see me yet? Listen to me! - Remember me? - Your water ran cold, Little Cloud. Your friends are here. We're off to glory! If you knew how pretty you are! Like a god! Are you done? Afraid, are we? You demigod, you. Not a problem. We're gonna do it today, you know that? You're on watch tonight, right? - Will you be done tonight? - Are you sure, Ecker? Alright, come out of there! - Can you do it? - Come out! - Jump out! - We're taking you someplace. Come on child, we'll lake you to a place. - You're gonna drag him right into this. -You're stupid! Come on now. - Come on, blow your nose. - We need to pack your stuff. Heh, I'm gonna pour you some honey. We're gonna buy you a bigger tub, a transparent one. Here, put it on. - You'll be a happy man. - I already am. Gee. You're not eating, fucker, you're thin. When did you stop eating? - This one won't make it for long now. - Shut up! He'll make it, Ecker is stronger than us all. Are you saying l wouldn't survive for 10 days here? Now listen up, Little Cloud! Know what? We'll get in too. - Come on! - Listen! You think you're the only smart kid here? No, we are too. Listen, Verő, listen! I'm serious now. There's no food until we got the big bucks, okay? Uh yeah? Well then, a blood pact. It's fine. Let's do a blood pact. Forget about blood, you ass. Blood?! Ewww. I'd like to see your blood for once. Don't come here, asshole! - You scared? - I don't need your AIDS-infected blood! Ecker, calm him down, this dumb-ass is all over me! Where are you, huh? Get lost or else I'll kick your head off. - Fuck off! - Blood is like this! What, ain't you interested? You wanna see this? I'm not chowing! I'm on a diet, see? So we're not eating, huh? Okay pal, but I'm gonna tear out your guts if you dare to eat! Hey now, sure thing. We're not eating. No chow. Just the job. Calm down! As you wish, you bull! Okay, end of discussion. Are you going to the stable! Come over here, Ecker, I'll take care of you. I won't let him touch you. Go ahead. Are you alright, Little Cloud? Tomorrow we'll travel! You, Verő, why do you need that stuff'? You never even look at it. You never looked at it a single time! - It's a beautiful picture. - Give it to me, I'll sell it. It's a serious deal. Don't you get it, you won't be fucked! You'll either make money or stick with your existing money. - It's high tech, you asshole! - Don't touch my hair, creep. I just wanna borrow it. It's a holy icon. Dig it? And don't take me for a fool, as I won't ever lend you a thing in this life anymore. Are you outta your mind? You'll have a flat, bro! There. Run! But don't you start yelling! Where's the icon? Listen, here's the thing: - Ecker walks in... - Uh huh. ...and walks out. Look at me, Verő. You're such a roughneck. Look here; you're sending your brother in to die. - What kinda guy you are? - If anything goes wrong, they're gonna fix you up because they know your face, right? You sink below and that's it. - Your cash is gone with you. - You're mistaken, Berlioz. I'm not going in there, feel me? - No sweat, Ecker will go in then. - No, he won't either. - Why don't you go in, babe? - Cause my face is important. I need to protect it; anyone meshes it hard, I'm done. This is what I need for my work. It's important, I need it. Understand, puppy dog? You're a beautiful one... Yet if they beat Ecker's face to a pulp, that don't matter to you. So should I bring it in? Get lost, scram. So you'll be the one, right? Ecker here will cover you. Come here, Ecker, listen up. You'll enter before Verő. You'll feel around inside. If somethings wrong, you'll subtly indicate it to us. Clear'? Okay- Do you think he comprehends it? Take good care of him. You'll never be that young! I'm gonna get you, creep! IDENTIFICATION May you rot in hell! Bum it all! Ignite it all! Kill him good! Relax. Come! Hurry! You got it? How much, huh? Ecker'? Motherfuck! Don't stop now, the guy's clean, you're through with it! Did Ecker swallow the icon? - Got the cash? - Fuck it! - You're picking up whores now? - What's with the cash? Where's the icon? Where's the dough?! You left the icon right there? Is this young man part of the troupe? The little lady's deaf... Were you looking for someone? If you don't wish to rot away, you need to take extra care that we never ever meet again. Understand me? Are you mute too, or just deaf? Hey- Wiseguy... Show me where it's gonna hurt! Alright, then stop somewhere and throw her right out! Just don't yell at me! You animal! She's a refugee, not even Hungarian. Don't you get that I never even touched her'? Where're we going, to Ecker? Hello Verő, hello Berlioz. What's up, boss? Where's your weapon, Henrik? Your country's being undermined. You're hustling here while we shed our blood, little son? If we win, you'll be executed, feel me? What's up, you got anything? - What'd you get on the market? - We became millionaires. You're hereto see Ecker'? He's not at home. Do you deal with refugees? Who's this woman? Tell me, Henrik: - Wanna pay? - It's cheap. Uh no, I'm afraid I'll catch something. She's a virgin. - Then I could get her for free. - Scram now! You're lying. - No one's virgin for free. - Get lost, Henrik! When will you move out? Can I go with you? Sure, with your momma. What now, aren't we bringing the woman? How long should we wait? Cool, bro, you still have your sense of humor. You screwed her, right? Whatever, what's your point? You're always doing this, so pathetic. Bro, don't mess with me. I'm so very hungry now. I'm so sad for Ecker; he's a genius, they'd buy him. He could make it inside. That one's a true loser. He can't even move on his own, eat on his own, he's rather starving instead. You're not even sorry for him, right? You fucked this up. You're crying now, huh? What's it to you? They're gonna blow up all this mess anyway. Oh! Would you like some coffee? You scared me good. - I'm so happy. - So am I. Are you the nightwatch Lacika? With two sugars, correct? There, it's fine. Eh? Yesterday, me and my friend went to a pet store because she wanted to buy one of those lizards, the kind with... ...the checkers. That you can keep among stones in the flat. And we brought umbrellas with us too, but it didn't rain. But... there wasn't any lizard there, only snakes. Real thick ones though. They were wimpling all the time. My friend... ...petted them, but I didn't dare to. So... it was like that. I don't know about you, but I don't sleep as much as I used to. Sometimes... Sometimes I don't sleep at all. It must be because I'm scared of my dreams. I have... ...the most terribly beautiful dreams. There are times when I'm walking and meeting folks, but there are times when nothing happens. And then... I'm walking for a long time... ...just like that. Are you staying here through the whole night? I'll bring up some more coffee, alright? Before I leave. There he is. You're in the system, huh? What a gun! Ecker, where'd you get the gun? What did it cost? What did it cost, huh? He has no money actually. I found it. This is for me, right? Are these the horses already, Ecker'? Listen, the system's up by the morning. We won't have the money. Come on! Aren't you a little weasel, Verő? Huh? What the fuck are you mumbling about with that poor excuse for a brain of yours? What are you going on about, kid? I need to pay down, see, bro? You stupid kid, I'm gonna cut you down if you don't quit. Tomorrow I'm leaving for the horse and make the grand bid. And I'm forcing myself inside. That is what we agreed upon, you fucker! Stupid bro! Gee! Hey, don't you touch me, just watch me! No can do! Just watch me! And now I'm going to show you. But only to you... You cannot enter this room. It's off limit! My humble apologies then. Who are you people? - You first. - What? - Tell her who you are. - We are, uh, the... We're rats wandering in the labyrinth of an urban jungle. Yes, yes. - Do you believe us, miss? - You're better off that way. Who're you looking for'? No one is here. - No one's here. - We're on our own. How said it is... What are you doing? Well, who should be first to go? - Me. - Not in this lifetime! - Why not me? - Because it'll be me. - It's me then. - Hell no. You screw her and I watch, right? No, that's not my style. All I want is her to feel good. - She's gonna laugh at me, stop that. - No, she won't. - This is what women dream about. - I'm shouting. I'm screaming. - Yes? Why? - I'm scratching. - We thought that... - What? Alright then: it's gonna be violence. Or how about it's her choice? Heh, I'll be curious to see that. Alright, it's him or me. How do you like my friend? I like him, but his hair looks all weird. - Should I cut it for you? - Jesus. And me? You I don't like, you're smug. Heck no, she's just frightened of me; one look at me and she's done. Look at me if you dare. On the table, yes. Smart. - Take off your clothes. - No. Do it! Are you crazy? Anything to drink here? I'm sure there is. Is there? - There is. - Where? In the lock box. - Where's the key? - There. Don't cry, don't cry, we're gonna love you. Yes. Santa Claus has been around? No. Payday will be after tomorrow. - Payday, huh? - Carry on! What day will be after tomorrow? There's a different setup due to the holidays. Different, huh? - What holidays? - Drink it all! Saturday will be Monday, Sunday will be Tuesday. Saturday 'll be canceled, but for what? - Leave it, who cares about the holidays? - Listen! It won't be canceled, it'll be placed after tomorrow. The earrings too, just keep on taking off all, dear. Should we lake it all? Take it now? - Or tomorrow? - Not in the morning. - You cannot do that! - Of course now! Just as a loan. Of course just as a loan! You can't take that! That's the payment. We're gonna take you too... Good, good... I can't open it! - Where are we going? - What do you think? We're escaping with a woman and the cash! You're such a primitive dork! Get in the back! You have lost your mind! Hey, what are you doing, Verő?! You were driving so reckless, that'll turn us in in the end. Do it like this, real smooth... Use the indicator lights. What's this hard stuff? Something's pressing against my breast. Give it to me. - It's a gun! - Give it to me. Where's the gun? It's so hard! Verő! - Should I press it here? - Yes. - Verő! - Relax, relax, relax. - Where are we headed now? - To dance. Dance, huh? Let's stop at the first place that we like. That sure is gonna be a long ride then. There's a church. Stop, stop, stop. I'm gonna get out here. I'll pray. The frickin''... These are animals. They can snap anytime. They are drunk as hell. That man never called me... Well, shall we confess? - To whom? - To each other. - Me to you. - And me to you. - You'd need a priest for that. - Don't be stupid. Listen. I sit here, you kneel there, and you confess your crime. - Just the truth? - Sure. And my lips are sealed. - So help you God? - I swear. - You smear'? - Sure I am. - Sure thing. - Yeah. You first right? Oh, okay. Come on. Just the truth. I confess to you, dear bro, that I was real mean to you. - When? - Not long ago. - And do I know about it? - Don't ask a thing. You don't know about it, I'm just showing you how to confess. Try to comprehend! You're a great guy, huh? It's always my tum to shut up. - Okay, let's change places! - Stay put now. Just watch. When you told me that... ...you won't give me that icon, remember'? - Yes. I was like, fuck this guy, if he's like that, I'm taking off with the cash. You wanted to escape where? Real far away. - And now you don't wanna? - No. I know now you're a pal. You're really my pal. Truly. And the cash we have on us, -you don't plan to disappear with? - No, no. You have changed. Completely. A confession needs to be taken seriously! Let's swap! Begin! Come on, begin! What's up, you're stuck? What's your sin? Tell me! Tell me! You hear me? Go on, confess! We were about to go dancing. Sounds good to me. Relax, good things will come. We're going below now. Verő, let’s just get out of here! I'm gonna lift you up from your animal roots. I'll make a king outta you. Gonna make you big. You'll see, I'll bring you into the circle. We'll become millionaires. We're gonna do it. How exactly? This place is as good as any. Love and friendship, these are that matter. And money. We're gonna get hammered, okay? Good evening! - Wanna have some fun? - And you? Sir, two raspberries! Two of the same! - Merrier! - Of course! Listen, bro: Ecker, system, cash! Ecker, system, cash! We really need to be focused now. Listen to me here! My lady! I'm basically a maharaja. You'll be out there and from that point they're your colleagues. We're going right home. I'm going home. I've had enough, I'm going home. Tweezers... I... need shampoo. Tweezers... Tweezers. You... are good? What is it? She doesn't pick up. - The phone's shit. - Listen, don't get crazy. I'm off to Ecker, see what goes on with the system. Meanwhile you scrape the woman together and meet me on the square. - I'll also bring Ecker. What is it? - You're a big guy. Okay, you go too then. I'll look for the woman. Okay? What's the problem with you? Do what you want then, okay? Go ahead, just go! - And you chow yourself full in the meantime, huh? - Yes. Sure thing, I'll lake care of the gal. Weasel! Alright then. Muchacho, bravo! Asshole! Motherfucker! He's my best friend. We love each other. - Is it genuine? - Of course, an original. - How much? - A million. Well, I'll be... - Hey my dear, how much... - Don't you touch me! Away with your hand, you drunk bastard! I'm gonna throw up. I can't take this anymore. Don't you touch me! I steal, I'm drunk again, - still nothing happens... - I missed you so much. - You're lying. - Sure I am. Lefts treat each other well, white lady. Leave me alone. Leave you where, here? It's over. Let's just die, okay? - You're a piece of work too! - But before that we chat, dance, screw, - touch, wrestle. - Don't! - Gimme one, come on! - No can do! It's gonna be a riot, a fireworks, fucking awesome! You don't love me. _ Hey! ' Gee! Taxi! Hello, Verő. They'll demolish tomorrow noon. All of them together. Even the chimneys. Listen Verő, you need to take me with you, I love to work, and you don't need to tell me anything twice. - Just me, it's me. - We're not going anywhere. - Relax. -lam... I am the best. Take me away! You're blind, Verő, can't you see I'm the guy? We'll notify you. Little Cloud! Hey, Ecker! Ecker! I'm taking the system. Hey! Well, is Ecker bathing? I thought I'll munch on something as I'm starving. Tastes pretty good. Poor souls are starving and here I'm chowing. We're not as stupid as them. I'm gonna pose you the question, Verő: you wanna stay here, right? Gigantic beast. You're hard. You're the hardest one in the compound. Ecker's like that too. You are dense kids. I quit. A change of shift, Mr Ecker's. How do you like that? Adios, Amigo! A champion of justice is a fool of the world. All out at! What is that you want? This one we'll save for Ecker, and then we're done. What do you want? Want blood, want blood? Sit, Verő, stay, sit! I'm gonna tear you up, you louse! Tear you apart! Come if you dare, where're you? May your brain rot away! I'm gonna tear your heart out, you faggot! It's Ecker! I'm gonna break you apart! Ecker's a monkey! - I'm gonna break you! - Come on if you dare! I'm gonna kill you! For fuck's sake, what are you saying? Wait up! Wait up! Wait for me! These are fools! Let them go! It's enough! Stop there! Lie down! Put this on! Come! Stay put! - Don't move! - Come! I'm gonna enter straight nirvana! My head will be like that! You know those happy faces, huh? My face will be like theirs, bro. I'm gonna enter you into the biz. In a flawless way! I told you we'll do it. I told you how to do it! You're so lucky dudes! We'll bring Ecker into the biz too. You know what 'll tomorrow bring? We'll lake off on an island. We'll enter with two trunks, and will laze away in the bar. We'll unload and shout: Hey, here we are, you lot! And they're just sitting there and all sleepy like. And they'll ask: hello there, what's your name? And I'll reply: my name is Berlioz. Come on you guys! Hey, wait! Ecker! Ecker, hey! Poet! My little millionaire, you! Fuck your mother! That f ricking...! Thanks, you're a good pal... ...Verő. You were a good kid. You'll do the same to me... Even my hands are shaking, fuck it! What's up now, eh? What, that's it? That's it then. For you at least. Why, is there anything else you want, any new ideas? You're mad, huh? What should we do, en balm him, build him a pyramid, or what on earth are we supposed to do? Alright, let's leave this place, Verő. Let's just go, Verő, hey. You're mad, huh? You wanna flee with Ecker, right? Are you out of it, Verő? Go on out. Leave for your biz. Go! Or I'll cut out your brains. I don't care. Cut them out. Sit down, Verő. Stay here a bit. Cure yourself, enter rehab. Prepare for demolition! Countdown! 20... 19... 18... 17... 16... 15... Hello, Verő. Get lost, Henrik. They are demolishing. They screwed up, it won't work for them. Command revoked... Hey, Henrik! There's a little job. Shall we bury him? I doubt he'd like it if we buried him. Well, what do you think he would like? Don't you have any luggage? Have a pleasant trip. Cast Directed by: Director of photography: Music by:
