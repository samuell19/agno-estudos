You can't destroy his home, please! Wait till the police get here! You won't tear our house down then! If they wanna die, then let 'em. Mrs. Yu. Mrs. Fei. We brought Xiao Fei home. Salute! Tell these rookies what our motto is. Be humble. I became a soldier because I wanted to see combat. And now... what about these exercises? Isn't it better to be at home, and spend time with my wife and kids instead? My daughter, She's beautiful. huh? You fucking scumbags! You think you're tough shit? Go get them. Get them! Officer, see! He's got a gun! A gun! Comrade, put down your weapon. You're pretty lethal, huh? Well you'd better kill me now, because when you're gone, I'm gonna make them wish they were dead. Hey! Leng Feng! The reason a soldier is respected is not because of the uniform he wears, but because of the sense of duty he carries. With or without the uniform, his duty remains. And he continues to be respected. Hey, hurry up. Hey Leng. There's our hero. Thanks for saving the lives of everyone. Let's take a picture together. No problem. Thank you! Ok, see you! Take care. See you! Come on, please, buy this. There was an outbreak in Taman last week I promise. Four people survived because they ate this, please. No, thank you. Boss. Chinese wine. Hey, hey. Come on man. Ok, this one is ok. Nice one. See you next time. Get up here! Welcome back. Bye. This is good for you. You're not alone. 20 dollars. Buy one, get one free. Who am I? My godfather. If your godfather tells your mother about this, what would she think? Confiscated. Begin! Godfather! Godfather! Godfather! Harry! Godfather! Godfather! Godfather! Leng! Who? Who? Who else? Who else? Do it, do it. Fuck it! Who the fuck do you think you are? Come on. Yeah. I'm being sent to the border for a mission. When I get back, this had better be signed. Why did you join the army? Join the army, regret it for two years. Don't join the army, regret it for life. Tell me the truth. That's the truth. Drink. Again. Comrade Long Xiao Yun was attacked while carrying out her mission at the border. We found this bullet. Drink again. What do you want to hear? What do you want to hear? Drink! Again! You win. We win. But I lost... I lost everything. It's been more than a year since you came on board. During that time I've asked every tribe from Djerba to Talanaro, more than half of Africa, but nobody has seen that bullet before. I will find it, even if I have to scour the entire continent. Dear fellow countrymen, my deepest condolences to the families who lost their loved ones during the Batchka Village incident Earlier today, the Red Scarf rebel army claimed responsibility for the Batchka incident. Our government condemns their barbaric behavior. Our homeland has been attacked on multiple occasions. These are great tragedies. The rebels continue to advance as the the Lamanla outbreak gets worse. As your government, we will not back down. The great people's army will fight to the very end. Quarantine zones have been set up across the country in an attempt to contain the Lamanla outbreak. We have declared a state of emergency. Excuse me, brother. You shorted me 300 bucks. Hey, be careful with that. Look, we're both Chinese. You do this to your own people? Since 3 pm on the 14th of last month, I am officially no longer Chinese. What? Fresh off the boat? Hear that? In times like this, that's the price you get. Seen this before? Nope. I've heard it came from these parts. Definitely never seen it before. Hey boss. How are you? Smoking? Tundu! Go! Go! Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Good people. Go, go, go! Get the fuck down or you die! Hail the revolution! Hail the revolution! Don't lie to me, or you're fucked. Hail the revolution! No, no, no. Revolution! What the fuck is this?! No, no, no. He's a pro-government rat! No! You lied to me! No! Hail the rebels! Hail the rebels! Shit! Tundu! Chinese embassy. Let's go to the Chinese embassy They'll take us in. We're Chinese. What about us? Will they accept us? Hard to say. That's our country. Everybody follow me. Go. Go. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on. Here. Help! Slowly. No, no! We're Chinese! Hurry! Tundu! Go, go, go. Die, scum! Hail the revolution! Die, scum! Die! Lower your guns! Put down your weapons. Put down your weapons. Lower your guns! Lower your guns! Stand down. We are Chinese. We are Chinese. China and Africa are friends. Go. Go, hurry. Go. Fall back. Help! Help! Captain, all foreign vessels are leaving the war zone. The harbor is unsafe. Are you certain about docking? Forward 10 knots. Set course bearing for 270. Open the gate. Ambassador Fan, well done. You got here just in time. Brief me on the situation. The entire country's in chaos. The war has destroyed the lives of so many of our countrymen. Can you send our troops in to help? Without the UN's authorization, our troops aren't permitted to enter the war zone. Ok, slow down. Up we go! Nice! Where are you from? He can't board. He's my son. We have tickets. See, look! 3 sheet. 79, 80, 81. Fine then. 79, 89, 30. Thank you. Where are we going? Mr. Prime Minister, please listen to me. I'm deeply sorry for what's happening in your country. But I believe you have not forgotten about the help we provided to your country and the friendship between our countries. I believe you understand how important our citizen Dr. Chen is to Africa. Please send somebody to protect his safety. I'm sorry, you're on your own this time. Prime Minister, Prime Minister! Where's Dr. Chen? I will never tell you. Let's go. 12 years of hard work. One war and it's all fucking gone The bullet... what's the story? Tundu! Tundu! If you get off, you can't get back on. Tundu! Tundu! Stop right there! I'm sorry. I want my mom! I want my mom. I don't want to go to China! Look at me. I want my mom! I want my mom! Trust your godfather. Trust your godfather. OK? Trust your godfather. Hey brother. What are you doing down here? There's something I have to tell you. That bullet... I've seen it before. The pattern is a symbol used by the rebel forces. An arms dealer friend of mine told me the rebels have hired the most expensive mercenaries out of Europe. I don't care what kind of grudge you've got against them, I urge you, don't go seeking death. 47 Chinese workers are still stuck at the Hanbond Chinese factory. What's worse, Dr. Chen is stuck 55 km behind enemy lines on a medical relief mission. He is currently a high value target for the rebel army. Everything is in total lockdown from Lochino to St. Francis. Without the UN's authorization, my troops aren't allowed to enter the war zone. I'm the mission commander for this operation. It's my call. I want all Chinese citizens including Dr. Chen evacuated. You should know better than anyone that our troops are prohibited from going in there. No one is going in. I can't just pull someone out of my ass! I'll go. Stop right there. Wolf Warrior squadron, Special Ops Brigade, South-East region, former PLA. Leng Feng. This child's mother is at the Hanbond Chinese factory. I know approximately where it is located. I promise, I will bring your mom back. We took care of business now, didn't we? Ambassador Thomas, King Angola, Prince Drew. That goddamn communications manager. They're all gone. They all disappeared real mysteriously. Stop bullshitting me. Where is Dr. Chen? Ah, Jesus. You tell him what you told me. Dr. Chen is at the St. Francis Chinese funded hospital. Good boy. Did you hear that? That could be the sound of the future. Sir, why are we helping these fucking idiots? Welcome to Africa, son. Alright, let's move out boys! From the latest report, the fighting is reaching Semshalemu harbor. The urgency of evacuating 1536 Chinese nationals has just escalated. Our vessels are heading over at top speed. I'm so sorry. You have no reinforcements. You're on your own. No allies. No weapons. Dr. Chen and the lives of 47 Chinese citizens are in your hands now. We can't leave anyone behind. My boss asked me to find Dr. Chen. Nobody wants to do anything! Now I have to try my luck Because I have a special vision. Let me guess... Are you Dr. Chen? I'm not! I'm not! Are you Dr. Chen? Are you Dr. Chen!? No, no, no. She's a child, just a child. I am. No. No. I am Dr. Chen. You are Dr. Chen? Looks like Dr. Chen doesn't have balls. What do you want? I am Dr. Chen. Dr. Rachel, no! She's not Dr. Chen. She's a very good doctor. She saved so many lives. No! Dr. Chen! Papa! You just killed Dr. Chen. Papa! Dr. Chen! Dr. Chen, right? I was sent by Ambassador Fan to rescue you. This is my daughter, Pasha. Please, I beg you, protect her. Dr. Chen! Come with me! No! Get in the car! Go east! What are you doing?! What do you think I'm doing? I'm saving your ass! Let me drive! Go, go, go! Jesus. Pasha! Are you ok?! Are you ok? Are you ok? Are you ok? Are you ok? Pasha. Stop! Stop! You want food? We have food. We have food, ok? Are you ok? Thank you. Is that from the quarantine zone? Pasha, can you please hand me the bag? I said, did you get that in the quarantine zone? It's nothing. I'm not overreacting. If fact, it'd be better if I was. Those people back there were infected with the Lamanla virus. Symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, hallucinations, lesions, cold sweats. It's a fatal virus that's transmitted through direct human contact. Upon contraction, death strikes between four hours and five months. So far, no cure has been found. Don't worry, I have health insurance. You're killing the Chinese? This is big trouble. Why are you killing the Chinese? Sir... I thought you wanted Dr. Chen. Congratulations. You found him. Fuck! I wanted him alive! Alive! Don't you understand how important it is to me? Fuck! Wait. That girl. I like her. I like her. Sir, our crew uploaded a video of this man fighting off some of the pirates. His name is Leng. Ex-member of a secretive special ops unit out of China Wolf Warrior. Boys! The Doctors Without Borders were killed by armed mercenaries. The lives of Dr. Chen and other Chinese medical staff were sacrificed. Comrade Leng, do you stand by what you're saying? Are you certain you witnessed the massacre or our medical team? I'm certain. Dr. Chen gave me his daughter before he died. An African girl. Her name is Pasha. Oh, and a nurse too. What's your name? Rachel Prescott Smith. You can call me Rachel. Doctor Rachel. I'm not a nurse. Report the situation to Ambassador Fan immediately. Yes sir. Captain, may I speak to my son please? Godfather, godfather! Where's my mom? Where's my mom? Hey, Tundu, Tundu! Trust me, trust your godfather. We are going to the Hanbond Chinese factory to find your mom right now, ok? Thank you godfather. Thank you godfather. Leng, I have some bad news for you. The rebel army is sabotaging all major roads, railways and bridges. As of 10 minutes ago, your only route to the port, the Bowerneja bridge, was bombed. We're formulating an escape plan now. But until then, you're on your own. Set your watch. The maximum time we can wait is 18 hours. After that, we'll be forced to leave. My deepest apologies. Please understand, I have a responsibility towards the others onboard. Copy that. You're going to the Chinese factory? We should go to the American Consulate. The US marines are stationed there. That's our safest bet. You think the US marines are the best in the world? That may be true, but where are they now? I've informed the embassy of the situation. Where are they? Tell me exactly how you informed them? I tweeted at them on Twitter. Welcome to the American Consulate. Unfortunately, we are closed. Fuck! All foreign navy ships left when I arrived. I watched them sail away from port, And among the countless masts fading into the horizon, I saw some kind of star spangled banner. Stop the car. Stop the car! Stop the car, I want to get out! Stop! Rachel. It looks like your GIs have arrived. I am Chinese. I'm here for Nessa. Tundu's mom. Nessa! Anyone home? I've been sent here to rescue you. By Ambassador Fan himself. You? Rescue us!? I've got 18 AK-47s, 30 M79 grenade launchers, enough to arm a platoon. And, I have an M1911 pointed at your head right now. How the fuck are you supposed to rescue us? Leng, Leng! Are you Leng? Are you Leng? Nessa? Yes, yes, yes! What about my son? He's safe. - He's ok? - He's ok. Oh, thank god! Thank god! He's ok. He's ok. Mom, mom. I'm ok, I'm ok! Oh, thank God! Mom, I'm ok! Because you're on a Chinese warship! I told you not to sell that porn! Here we go. I guarantee you won't find better dumplings in Africa. I flew in a chef from China. Fresh, just for you. Thank you. What are you looking at? Seen one before? Ever shot one of these? The wolf you see here, I killed it myself with this gun. Who drew this map? I instructed our head of security, Laohe, how to do it. It still needs some work. Laohe, come over here for a second. I've told you so many times to finish Sector A to Sector D. Why isn't it done yet? I'll get on it right away. Laohe, write it down quickly. You're supposed to be our head of security. What if something happens during the operation? Then what? This is a real man's toy. Don't be afraid. From now on, your safety is my responsibility. I will protect you. Thank you! Thank you so much! You're welcome. Thank you. Hey kiddo, try this, it's super yummy. Hey! You brat! I'm fine. What's the big deal? I think she's kind of cute. Good news. Ambassador Fan just called. Tomorrow 0700 hours, a UN rescue helicopter will be landing at this factory to evacuate us. Just one? Attention please. Everybody. Everybody listen to me. Quiet down everyone. Listen to me. All Chinese employees, stand on this side. We are only taking Chinese people. Management goes first. I will lead the evacuation. Is that clear? All the Africans please stand this side, please. Clear? Harry. No, boss, no. Please. Come on, come on. Get moving. Get moving. Anyone else? Come, move, move, move. That side. That side. What are you doing? She's my wife. She's pregnant. Look. Any more Chinese? Any other Chinese? Lin, listen to me. Everyone here is my employee. I'm taking them all with me. How? Come on, come on! Don't stop. Get moving. Get moving. Chinese, this side. Fellow Africans, that side. Chinese people, this side. She married me. So she's one of us. I'm taking her with me. You... Fine. Stay there. That's perfect. Come on! Come on! Guys, guys, please, please move. Stand that side, please. African people, please, African friends. Trust me, this is good for you. Come on, hurry up. Get moving. You want to be on this side, yeah? Fuck off, bro. What's up? Why? Oh, man. Give me a line down the middle. I want to see a clear boundary line. Show me the line, please. I brought the helicopter. I call the shots. Everyone leaves tomorrow. Children and women leave with the chopper The men will follow me on foot. Yay! Everybody. We leave together. Old timer, the defensive formation out front, that was you, right? You're not bad yourself. Former People's Liberation Army of China, 14th Corps, South-West region, Recon Company Commander. He Jian Guo. Former People's Liberation Army, Special Ops Brigade, South-East region, Wolf Warrior Squadron. Leng Feng. At your service. Drink in your honor. An hour ago, these people didn't know if they'd live to see tomorrow. Why are they so happy? Our African friends, it doesn't matter if it's war, disease or poverty, once they're around the bonfire all their cares go away. Africa. Great food. Nice scenery. Hot women. Hey. - Cheers. - Cheers. I don't want to ride my father's coat tails all my life. I love this place! Lions, crocodiles, AK 47s, sniper rifles, and the melody of gunfire you can't get in a peaceful country. To me, that is the most wonderful sound in the world. Do you want to know why Pasha bit you today? Because her father was killed by the AK47s you so adore. If this were you, would you still think it's wonderful? Oh man, look at this. That's a big party. I love these things. Look at them. Fuck! Pasha! Pasha! Pasha! Shit! Let me go! Take out the veteran. Athena, take out the old man. Stay here! Let her go! Pasha! Like ants when you lift a rock. Fuck! Help me! They got my leg! You're fine. Shit! Go! Go! Outta ammo! Go! What are you doing man? Fuck! Let's split up. Go. Go! Hurry! Damn it. Come on! Let's go! Pasha. Pasha, where are you? Move out of the way. Bitch. Run! We know you're not a soldier anymore. What the fuck are you fighting for? Once a Wolf Warrior, always a Wolf Warrior! Bear, you're on point. Athena, cover the exit. I want this son of a bitch. Team Charlie, spotted target. We are in pursuit. Sir, Team Bravo has target 12 o'clock. What the fuck? Those idiots want us to retreat now? This is General Inuwa, everyone return to base. Return to base. Big Daddy, I'm ordering you to get the fuck back here now! Hey! What the fuck are you doing? I told you so many fucking times that we cannot kill the Chinese! China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. And I need them on my side if I am to take political power. You fucking asshole! Kill Leng, and find Pasha, and you'll be the king of this fucking country. As you command, sir! Hold it! Leng Feng! Who are you? We just fought a battle together, what's your deal? Brother Fan, we were pretty safe before this guy got here. Ever wonder why the rebels showed up after he got here? He's a friend of my son. He came here for me. Have you met him before? My son always talks about him. So? I trust him! He rescued Pasha and me earlier today at the hospital. He's been protecting us ever since. Let me get this straight. You met him the same time your doctor friend died? People are getting killed around him while he's alright. Friend. Speak for yourself. Get off me! Lamanla. Lamanla? He has Lamanla! Lin! He is my friend. He just saved my life. What about them? What about them? Last month, one person got Lamanla at the comms center 10 km away. In the end, the whole place was wiped out. Everyone's life is at stake here. Look, it's not just my opinion. Ask them yourself. I'll leave. Wait. You all know what happens to someone infected with Lamanla. I hope you'll always remember this dying man saved all of you Shame on you! Shame on all of you! Leng Feng! Leng Feng! Leng Feng! Leng Feng! How confident are you with a gun? So-so. There's no place in my team for so-so. Trying to get me drunk so I blurt out the truth? Will you blurt out the truth? Certainly. What are you like when you're drunk? I'll let you buy me drinks when you come back. You're the one who didn't come back. Get back here. Cut it out. When I get back, this had better be signed. It's easy to die when you're on the attack, But it's a hard life carrying a survivor's guilt. But you didn't come back. It's you who didn't come back. You didn't come back. Against who? Who were we fighting yesterday? Didn't your mom tell you that you shouldn't play with a gun? Leng! That was Leng, only him alone. It was me! I was in the military before I worked here. Does anyone here look like they can shoot? Ok. You're up. It's a shame Dr. Chen didn't live to see this. He discovered the presence of self-healing properties in humans. In extremely rare cases, Lamanla antibodies can be found in patients. Among the thousands of Lamanla patients he treated he chanced upon one such person. And that person is Pasha. So Pasha's not his daughter but his patient. From the analysis of Pasha's blood he created an experimental vaccine. Last night was a dire situation, so I did the experiment that Dr. Chen couldn't. I performed the first human trial using Dr. Chen's newly synthesized vaccine immunogens. Honestly speaking, I didn't know what would happen. Luckily God was on our side. The population has lost faith in the government to contain the outbreak. So whoever takes Pasha takes the country. That explains why the rebel army is hot on our heels. My dad said man walked out of Africa 100,000 years ago. Africa is the cradle of modern civilization. Yet when the "evolved, civilized" humans returned to this land, they brought along with them nothing but suffering, slavery, disease and war. Koreans, Icelanders, Slavs, Americans and over there are the Chinese. People from all over the world, people like my father. For Africa they gave their best years. In the end they got to remain here for eternity What's her name? Sorry? The person you can't seem to forget. Long Xiao Yun. She's lucky to have a man that loves her so much. Why didn't she come back? Sorry. I want you to round 'em up like cattle. Make 'em feel safe. You understand me? Yes sir We got mountains to the west, we got forests to the east. The only smart place for them to come is right here and wait for the rescue helicopter. I sure hope these Chinese people don't die. I'm about the only thing that can save them right now. Round 'em up Everybody, let's go! Let's go! Move, move, move out! Wait till I get out of here, I'm going to settle the score with them. Brother Fan, cut the fucking bullshit. How are we going to get out? And besides, what are you planning to do? What can you even do? Brother Fan, in normal times, everyone gives in to you. In battle, no one's going to listen. Shut the fuck up! Go to hell! Brother, how are you holding up? Not as well as back in the day. Your hands are for saving lives not taking them. How would the Wolf Warriors fight this battle? Go! Go! Didn't your mother tell you not to play with the weap.. Didn't your mother tell you not to fuck with spoiled brats? Let's go! Here's evidence of the rebel army killing Chinese citizens. Transmission received. We will gather up all the information, and have Ambassador Fan submit it to the UN. Copy that. Oh, and one more thing. We've received the official request for military assistance from the local government. The chopper will arrive shortly. We're waiting for you. Copy that. Get on the chopper. There are a lot of people here who still need me. Lin Zhi Xiong! Women and children must get on the chopper. Right now I'm not a woman, I'm a doctor. And besides, I'm more professional than you when it comes to saving lives. Well I'm more professional than you when it comes to protecting them. Pasha, are you ready to go on the helicopter? Can you pass me some gauze please? Get on the helicopter. Don't be difficult, ok? Excuse me? Excuse you my ass. Whoa, what was that?! Mayday! Mayday! United Nations 06. Missile strike! Tail rotor lost! I have control. Going down! Going down! Mayday! Mayday! Brace! Brace! Boss! Go! Go! Go! Run! To the bunker! Hurry! Rachel! Wake up! Come on! Come on Rachel! Rachel! Go find Laohe. Get up! Come on! Fuck! Get to the bunker! Go! Quick! Go! Go! Quickly! Get ready! Fire! Kill that motherfucker! Reload! I can't aim. This thing's so heavy! You wanna die!? Trigger that fuse and it'll kill us all! Fire! Oh, check it. Three clicks down. Fire! They found the bunker! I got it! I got it! To the left. Copy that. Reload! We're out! Hang on! Fire! Son of a bitch! Fuck! Move this fucking thing. Come on, come on, come on, come on! Good,good,good. Fuck! I guess the Chinese military ain't as lame as I thought. Cut the crap. Go! Go! Hurry! Don't come out! Track the signal and verify targets' position! Godfather! Mom! Sir, we've triangulated on his phone's position! Sir, target locked on. We've received authorization from the UN. Fire! Now it's personal. Long Xiao Yun. Is that your girl? She's pretty. Blood... ...for blood Please don't fight! Look at them. You're gonna die for those people. I was born for them. People like you will always be inferior to people like me. Get used to it. Get fucking used to it. That's fucking history. Welcome back. The war zone is up ahead. We can't get through. Unknown vehicle convoy to the east. Brother, pass me the flag. Drive. It's Chinese. Stop the fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! It's Chinese. To the citizens of the People's Republic of China: When you find yourself in danger in a foreign country, never give up hope. China's strength will always support you. Leng Feng. Commander! I see you're enjoying your life. So, I guess you don't want to rejoin the Wolf Warriors? Sir, the earliest flight out of here departs next Tuesday at 2:15 PM. I will be reporting to duty on Friday 0900! There's something I need to tell you... And cut. God was on our side. Hold the gun down. It will explode again.
