Timing and Subtitles by (The Stolen Identity 2 Team @Viki) Oversee server connection Connected Error Error Access granted (Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Server Room) Entering the database (Public Security Bureau) (Public Security Bureau) (1996) Thank you! Thank you. Sakuma! Thanks, man! Asami, you can still call it off. Don't be stupid! Don't say that now! Asami. Later! Thanks for coming, Mr. Kagaya. Congratulations, you two. Thank you. Right... this is my girlfriend. I'm Minori. Congratulations. Thank you. Your boyfriend is our savior. Last year, when we got stalked by a real psycho, Mr. Kagaya saved the day! You never told me! I didn't want to worry you. What's going on with him now? The investigation's still underway, but I assure you that Urano won't walk free. Your wedding's next! Well... We're both busy at the moment, so... Try losing your phone like I did. Hey, that's not funny! But that's why we're together! Wanna go for a drink, Minori? If you're tired, I'll take you home. Kiss me. What? Kiss me here, right now! But there are people everywhere. It's inappropriate for an investigator... People always say what a nice guy you are... and I say, "Not always" only half joking. Sorry? We've dated three years, but you've never discussed our future. Because... I haven't even met your mom. I hinted about living together, but you made an excuse. I guess you never intended to marry me. But you mean a lot to me, Minori. It's not like I'm not thinking about our future. OK then. Register me as your fianc√©e. Register you...? A friend in the police force told me that if get engaged, you should tell your boss. Right. Can you do that? Say something! Do you think I'm being selfish? Sorry. What for? OK. We're through then. What's the emergency? Oh no! Why are you crying? Manabu just watched me walk away... When I told him we were through. Why did you tell him that? I wanted to make him realize... It backfired. I'm done with him. Maybe Manabu is gay? (I'll do anything you ask.) He could be dating you to hide his true desires... Oh no, it's so possible... I need healing... Don't be stubborn. Give him a chance. Why? You got your job through him. Besides... you love him. (Network connection established) It makes no sense. Be quiet, manga lover! How about you and your owl obsession? Oh, I can use free Wifi. (Logged on) I have to log in twice? What's good about owls? They don't move... They're like statues. (User name = Minori Matsuda) (Cute owls!) A barn owl! How adorable! What's a barn owl? Look! I saw it the other day. Owls are so healing. Background control. Backdoor opened. (See user's photos) (Stolen Identity 2) The rain washed away the soil. Let's check the boundary marker. OK. Are you OK? Yes. (Kanagawa Police Security Bureau) (Cyber Crimes Unit) Good morning. Good morning. It was in the log. No one could do this from outside. I suspect a backdoor. Hello. What happened? (Captain Nozaki) Someone hacked our mainframe computer again. For classified information. On intelligence activities? It's unclear, but only a shrewd hacker could break into our system. My Socialbook friend sent me a message... (Deputy Miyake) Sir. He said I've been sharing links to shopping sites. Sir, these are scam sites. They won't send the product you paid for. Isn't that a crime? Yes. But I don't remember posting anything! Someone took over your account, sir. How? The hacker leads you to a site after you log into free Wifi. I have to log in twice? And your password's stolen. You need passwords for online banking and shopping, right? Many people use one password for everything. It's hard to manage many. That's the danger... Once it's stolen, the hacker uses your identity for online services and uses your money to buy things. What now? Change your password. Then tell your friends you were hacked. OK. Cyber Crimes, Nozaki speaking. Right away. Kagaya, another body was found in Tanzawa hills. Describe the scene. Yes! The surveyor who came across the female corpse was there to monitor the national forest. He speculates that the body was exposed after the rain. Anything on her identity? Yes. The coroner estimates that the time of death was three years ago and she was between 25 and 30. (Inspector Makita Investigation Bureau) Was any ID found? A bag was found containing a healthcare card. Belonging to Shoko Hasegawa, 28. Her family said she's been missing for three years. We're doing a DNA check. The body was found close to where Yoshiharu Urano buried bodies. Could she also be Urano's victim? Inspector... Yes? If you please. This is her before she disappeared. Urano only murdered women with long black hair. But she has short, dyed hair. Back to square one! Kagaya. Sir? I want to ask you a favor. Detective Busujima, how are you? You're probably aware that Urano won't cooperate. So I'm sure he won't discuss this case. (Detective Busujima Investigations) But there is one person who he wants to meet. And that's you. He says he'll speak to you. Can you try to speak with Urano? Yes, sir. Kagaya. Don't let him trick you. Right. I wish I didn't have you! I know your mother said that to you. I wish I didn't have you! You and I are the same. Why were you born? It's your fault. I wish I didn't have you... Down the end. OK. Hi, Cutie! Be quiet. How do I authenticate Horizon? By pressing the F2 key twice. You finally came... Manabu Kagaya. You know my name? You're known for your work in cybersecurity. Hackers hate you because of your antivirus software. I have a question. Do you know her? Was she found in Tanzawa hills? How do you know? Listen, Kagaya. Mom hit me so much when I was a kid that I was numb to it. Answer me. Eventually my emotions were non-existent. But you're attracted to women with long black hair. Yes. But I don't know how to relate to people. Tell me what's between love and hate? If it's about being neutral, how's that feel? That's enough! What will you offer in exchange for information? I know you hate your mother. I'm not like you! What do you two talk about? Be quiet! I won't help you unless you tell me. That person... We haven't talked for 10 years. That person. M killed the woman in the photo. Who is M? A charismatic black hat hacker on the dark web. He's my dark web mentor. Urano, attack vulnerability in security patch. M. He's right. I'm in. M, you have the moves. How do you know M's the killer? I learned about the hill and where to bury bodies from M. You might find more bodies. Come in. Sir. Like Urano said, a body was found. This time it's a man. A man? Daisuke Yoshimi dated Shoko Hasegawa before they went missing three years ago. Do you think Urano's right about M being the killer? It's hard to tell. He might have made it up. Is there a way to prove that M exists? The victims' computers might give us some clues. We checked and found nothing. If data were remotely erased, maybe I can restore it. Hello. Good morning. (Founding members, 2013) Good morning. Hi. The CEO shouldn't do that! Thanks. (Hajime Sasaoka CEO, IT Guardian) You stayed over? Galaxy Soft codes kept me from the last train. No one's waiting for me anyway. It's time you got married! An eligible CEO like yourself. No way! I'm too busy to meet anyone. Will you marry me, Minori? I know you say that to every girl you meet. You know me! Well, you have Manabu. Hey! Is there a problem? No. Here. Confide in me any time. Manabu was my right-hand man. Thank you. Good morning. Boss! Did you see the news update on Layla coin? Layla coin? Remember? 58 billion yen in virtual money was stolen. Oh that! (Layla Coin Exchange) (Buy, market orders) What? Access privileges changed? (Money transferred) What's wrong? (Money transferred) Shut down the server! OK. (Balance) Who's doing this? Stop it! (Transfer processed) But then JK16, a white hat hacker saved the day! She wrote online that she'd marked the stolen coins. Really? What happens to marked virtual money? The thief can't cash it. And his identity might be exposed. The worst case scenario for the thief. The thief must be in a panic. (Layla Coins and JK16) JK16, the good hacker! Dear, thief. The 58 billion yen in virtual money that you stole was marked by me! Better not cash it. (Liked) I am awesome! (Cyber Crimes Unit) (Restoring data) Hopefully the deceased's texts are here. (Data restored) (Mail) (Work) There! "I'll pay you well. Interested? M" M... 13 messages with M... "I'll pay the amount you requested." "I put half of it in your virtual money account. M" "What are you up to? Don't cross me. M" "I can't reach Shoko. What did you do to her?" "I warned you not to underestimate me." "Yoshimi, if you want her to live, do as I say." Yoshimi was a white hat hacker. He tried to expose M and M retaliated. Urano was right about M being the killer. It's safe to assume so. Speaking of M, he may be the one who stole the Layla coins last week. JK16 marked the stolen money and M direct-mailed her. I hacked your PC. I have your personal information. Remove the marks or I'll kill you. M Holy shit! I'm in trouble! Then JK16 told everyone on the internet. (M blackmails JK16) You wimp! I won't give in to your childish tactics. I don't know what to believe, but the cryptocurrency theft is a problem for the police. - Kagaya. - Sir. Find out what you can about M. M can be found in the exclusive community of the dark web. They'd shut it down if a stranger like me, accessed it. What about Urano? 58 billion yen in virtual money? Way to go, M. We have to learn his identity. Can you help us enter the dark web? Yes, if you accept my conditions. There's no plea bargain for homicide. Serial killers can't escape the death penalty. I know that. I want a high-end network environment. With a high-end computer and meals of my choice, I can find M. But- These are my conditions. I'll talk to my boss. Do it soon or else... there'll be more tragedy. How's that? Please... (Manabu Kagaya) (No new messages.) Why hasn't he texted me? Call him! What? Why should I? You said he changed your fate. You'd give that up? Hi. What's wrong? I can't believe it. You haven't called me since we broke up. Sorry. I'm working on a big case. Here. You left them at my place. Sorry about the other day. I didn't know how to react. It's OK. It revealed a lot. Sometimes I've felt this wall between us. I felt that I wasn't what you wanted. Minori. Listen... Mr. Kagaya. Why didn't you call me? I've been waiting! Wait here. Can we talk outside? I've been busy... (Graceful Life Hospice) I don't want you to regret it. I appreciate what you've done but... Who's she? Kagaya here. A dead woman was found by the pier. Her parents had reported her missing. Her name's Saeko Jinguji, otherwise known as JK16. (Body found by Tama River is possibly JK16) (Chief of Investigation Bureau) The thief is at large and now the white hat hacker has been killed. We have no leads on Yoshimi and Hasegawa's murders. (The police are incompetent) The police have lost the citizens' trust. Kagaya. Sir. Enlist Urano as an extra-legal measure. Sir? But it can't get out. We'll only inform a selected few. So JK16 was found dead? Now you need my help. Help me find out who M is. OK. Can I add one more condition? What now, you smug son-of-a-bitch? It's nothing hard. Mr. Kagaya. Tell me a secret that no one knows about you. A favor for a favor. I could lie. Try me. See if you can trick me. As you requested... (Special custody suite) There's one thing I miss in prison... Not nice meals or a nice bed... This! I didn't say you could touch it! (Sergeant Yoshihara Investigations) You maggot. Stop that, Yoshihara! It's a shame we need this maggot's help! I'll be watching you, asshole. We're mirroring your monitor so we'll see your every move. Entering dark web. Mr. Sasaya. Didn't you start up this company with Manabu? That's right. Did you two talk about personal things? Like ex-girlfriends? What's bothering you? It's nothing but... If you have doubts, you should leave him. Huh? You might be able to find someone better. Let me get you coffee. Minori, can you look at my comp? (Sergeant Manabu Kagaya) (Graceful Life Hospice) (Graceful Life Hospice) Is it him? Is it you, Nozaki? What now, sir? I have this feeling that I'm being watched. It's very creepy. Maybe your phone has a backdoor? A backdoor? Whoever hacked your account might be operating your phone remotely. No way! The hacker can see you and check your browsing history. You mean, he can monitor me 24/7? Do you check porn sites at work...? The Horny Sommelier 2... What's that? I didn't say anything. Where is Kagaya, by the way? The Inspector's got him on the Tanzawa case. (Horse Race tips) I'll bet on 1-5-7, box. (I told you not to underestimate me...) I think this is M. You sure? He sent me a similar message. Why did he advise you on graves? Because I paid him. That's what the dark web's ideal for. Can you prove it? Oh, you're suspicious! OK, this will convince you. M's hiding place. I was so curious that I had to find him. Where is he? Police! No one's here! Keep looking. Blood... Come here! - Check inside. - Yes, sir. You were right about M's hideout. Did you catch him? No. He'd already gone. Good. That gives me more play time. It's no game! Don't worry, I'll find him. You risked your job by telling me why you became a cop and your dad's secret, so I owe you. By the way, I set a trap for M. A trap? Serial killer informs ace investigator, Kagaya about M. I put it on a dark web bulletin board. M can't miss it. I'm sure he'll make a move. Mrs. Yasuoka. We have fun activities today. - That sounds good. - Great. Were you with Mr. Kagaya the other night? Yes. And- Are you visiting his mother? His mother? We provide care for patients with terminal cancer. What do you do here? My job is to ease the residents' anxieties. Mr. Kagaya hasn't visited his mother since she arrived. Her health is deteriorating so I asked him to visit her. Mrs. Kagaya. This is Ms. Matsuda. A friend of your son. Hello, my name is Minori Matsuda. Is Manabu doing well? He has some kind of Internet job, doesn't he? Yes. So you're Manabu's girlfriend? Yes. I guess he doesn't know that you're here. He wouldn't like it if he found out you came. Why wouldn't he...? He never told you about me? Go on. Eat up. Yes? - You owe me 300,000 yen in interest! - Keep it down. I'll pay when I get my salary. You keep saying that! Give me a break. Alright, already. When Manabu was 5... his dad died on the job. He was a police officer. But we weren't informed of the circumstances. I ended up having a breakdown. And Manabu... I abused him. I said terrible things to him... Over and over. I'm certain that... he holds a grudge against me. Back off, Kagaya or I'll bury Minori. M (Minori) I got a spooky text. Urano, M made a move! Is she your girlfriend? Can I see her photo? M goes for people's weak spots. Like he did with Daisuke Yoshimi. Yoshimi, if you want her to live, do as I say. The message was sent via an anonymous network. I can't trace the sender. Right... And her phone... is being remotely controlled. You mean that I was being watched? Yes. Have you lost your phone recently? Did you use an app or a site where you logged in twice? I don't know... But why am I a target? To threaten me... The perpetrator I'm after is using you to blackmail me. I'm in charge of this operation, Ms. Matsuda. Can I ask you to keep using this phone? Removing the backdoor will alert M. We might be able to lure him to you. You'd use her as bait, sir? We'll guarantee her safety at all times. You can't! This is a serial murderer! I know the risk involved. But... this is our only chance. OK, I'll cooperate. Minori... What's got into you? Do you know how dangerous this is? Do me a favor. Visit your mother. You met her...? You know she's unwell! See her or you'll regret it. Ms. Minori Matsuda? I'm Officer Otosaka, your guard. I'll drive you home. I appreciate it. Keep this phone. To contact me and Sergeant Kagaya. Minori! Keep me safe. And catch the killer. You let her keep the phone? You understand how dangerous that is, don't you? She must feel afraid... but she's doing it for you. Because she loves you. Mr. Kagaya, do you think you deserve her? Shut up! I've never seen you like this! You sure about using her as bait? She has 24-hour protection. I'll make sure that there's tight security. OK. If there's anything I can do, let me know. Thank you. Have you ever considered coming back to work with me? Sorry? You made this company what it is today... We just live off the proceeds from your work. The company needs... I mean, I need you here. I have to say no. I can't meet your expectations. Right... See you. Are you OK? You look pale. Rest when you can. Thank you. Get in. I have a quiz for you. Here's JK16's blog... and Kanagawa Police website. The victims' company website... And the homepage of Minori's workplace. All four sites have been accessed from a certain IP address. Guess who the IP belongs to? You know... It's us. I need more data. Let's use a bait. How? Use the Police website and start a blog called Kagaya's cyber security diary. Ask your girlfriend to do the same. Like, uploading photos on her Socialbook page. If the target doesn't come to you, you go to it. OK, we'll give it a try. Hello? The killer? We searched a man we pulled over. And found JK16's credit card. Sayako Jinguji... I borrowed it. We arrested him and questioned him. He admitted to a role in JK16's death. You'd never met her before? Right. Negishi suddenly attacked her... and killed her on the pier. He was a driver hired on the Deep Web. A man named Negishi... is the one who killed JK16, according to him. His composite. M wouldn't show his face. Negishi is probably a contract killer. Urano, chow time. I squeezed this for you, myself! I'm diabetic, so it might be a little sweet. Enjoy. Mr. Yoshihara. How big is your debt? I'm coming. Hey, there. Evening. Keep it up. Your diary and Minori's account were viewed frequently by three IP addresses. Tokyo Police... Hajime Sasaoka. That's Minori's boss. He knows the deal, so it's not odd. And a man named Naoki Miyazono. It's probably a pseudonym. Can you remotely access his computer? Zero day attack? Yes. It won't be detected with my homemade malware. So- I know it's illegal, but we have no choice. You'd do anything to protect Minori. My virus takes a snapshot the moment it infects the system. We can see his face. (Minori Matsuda) (Kagaya's Security Diary) (A challenge to M) I caught your stooge. You're next. Mr. Kagaya. This is M... Inspector, we have a photo of the suspect known as M. Run a criminal database check. This might be M. Do you know his face? M...? His profile doesn't match anyone in the database. All we can do is wait for his move. Meet me at Yokohama station at 2PM. Do me a favor. Visit your mother. That's the look of a kid who forgot his homework! Will you see your mom? Didn't she have a breakdown after your dad died? Stop it! We're being recorded- My situation was worse. Since the day I was born, my mother thought... "I wish I'd never had you..." Shut the hell up! Stop crying! I wish I'd never had you! I was so devastated when the bitch died... Because I'd hoped to kill her myself. How could I ever love anyone? Damn it. Damn it. Urano, don't... Urano, stop it! Urano! Mr. Kagaya. How can I learn to love someone? Tell me please. Please. You've got to tell me. Mom... Mom... I hate you. Why were you born? It's your fault. My life's ruined! Manabu? I finally know... what I've been afraid of. Inside me... that woman is an inseparable part of me! What? I can't see her. Manabu! Guys, did you know that our official website has been redesigned? See? It's Kapie the mascot. This was my project when I was with PR. It's up! I'm the first to access it. Looking good, Kapie. "I've taken over your website. M." What's this? Who's M? I have to go back to work. Manabu! You might hate your mom, but if she didn't have you... we'd never have met. Live from the Police HQ. The police website has infected citizens' computers. I was told to pay a ransom! The website has caused a panic and citizens have stormed the building. Stay calm! Sorry. Captain. M has infected our system. Citizens' computers were breached with time-bomb ransomware. Any device that accessed the site will be disabled. "Pay 50,000 yen in five hours or your data will be erased." I told all the departments not to access the site. We should shut down our server. Hey, Urano! Buddy. Can you deposit another 5 million in my account? Don't ignore me! This is what you get for gambling! You creepy maggot! (Fire Alarm System) The man I suspect is M is behind you, but act natural. - Out of my way! - Otosaka! Go! Move! Are you OK, Otosaka? I'm going back to work. All the terminal devices are down! What should I do? Should I pay 50,000? Hey, watch out! Asshole. What the...? He's dead! (Suspects database) (Yoshiharu Urano) (Edit entry) Sir! Kagaya! Look, he's dead! Inspector. Urano has escaped! Urano got out! Move it! Yes, sir! Excuse me. Mr. Nishi! Are you OK? What happened? I was attacked from behind... What? Where's my uniform? Urano! (Fires detected) He's still in the vicinity. Launch a citywide manhunt! Yes, sir. Task Force to HQ, this is emergency. The suspect, Urano, has escaped. Refer to photo. (Hiroki Yoshihara) I found out who M is, as promised. (To Manabu) I can't contact Otosaka. I've got confirmation on the woman. (Negishi to M) I'll decide when I'll deal with her like you said. Layla coins deposited by M. (Balance) Is this a live feed? Minori... Run! You may board. You may board. Let me verify your ID. Inspector! Urano's data...! (The suspect, Yoshiharu Urano) That's not his face... (Edit entry) Minori! Minori? The police phone! Inspector! Minori was adducted by M or his stooge. Requesting backup! 10-4. (Tomei Expressway) HQ to all personnel. Sergeant Kagaya needs backup. Abductor's car is southbound on Tomei Expressway. Stand by for developments. It's me. I know, M. I'll bury her where you said. I won't screw up. I'm a pro! But I have my own needs. Shut up. (Hatasawa Rest Area) Alright... Quiet or you're dead. That's a good girl. You have two phones! You tried to trick me! Manabu. Minori. Police! Let her go! I dare you to shoot. You wimp. Come on. Let her go. - I'll shoot. - Drop it! Or she's dead. Don't! Because we're the same. Why were you born? Keep me safe, Manabu. M... You're... Manabu! Manabu! Manabu, don't die! Minori. Run, Minori! Who are you? Manabu. Manabu! Where do you think you're going, M? I'm arresting you, Sasaoka for theft and being an accomplice to murder. (One week later) Come in. You look better! Can we talk? Hyodo, Security Bureau. I'm a cyber crime investigator. Three months ago, a hacker accessed the database on the police mainframe. I traced the IP address to an apartment rented by... your girlfriend. So I put Minori Matsuda under surveillance. And learned that you were her boyfriend. I had no idea that you were Yoshiro Kagaya's son! You knew my father? He was... my superior. Did you hack the database to learn... about your father's death? Yes. The Bureau gave no details about the circumstances of his death. That... tormented Mom and I. I found the records and finally learned how my father died. A spy in our organization... tried to sell secret documents to the Eastern bloc. It was a highly classified case. Your father outed the spy... and stopped him at the cost of his life. He was honorable... You became an officer to learn about him? Yes. Normally I'd arrest you for illegal access... but we can't afford to lose a good hacker like you. I'll erase the evidence from the records. I appreciate it. I bet you've done your share of illegal accesses in your job. Maybe we should be partners. I have one favor... Can I meet M? Are you in pain? Not now. Good. How did you know it was me, Manabu? Urano gave me your IP address. I accessed the link and found evidence of the Layla coin theft. And the photos of me. You saw the photos I saved...? Yes. Oh boy! You stole the cryptocurrency and ordered the murder of JK16. Correct? (Kill JK16. I'll pay whatever you ask.) Yes. Why...? I needed money... to keep our company going. Did you infect the police server with ransomware and disable it? Yes. With JK16 dead, you could have just cashed the coins. Why did you do it? Someone noticed my crime and blackmailed me. You're not M. You're Hajime Sasaoka. You stole the cryptocurrency and killed JK16. He said he'd expose me if I didn't comply. Who killed Daisuke and Shoko? I didn't! I just pretended to be M, so JK16 would be scared off. It means that the man who killed those two is... your blackmailer. Manabu. I loved you. I know you knew! (No ID) Hello, Manabu Kagaya. Urano. I'm glad you weren't hurt too badly. You blackmailed Sasaoka into infecting the police server. That's right. How did you know it was him? I used zero day attack on Sasaoka's computer. I restored his deleted texts and saw his texts to Negishi and JK16. You cooperated so you could escape. It was all planned. I was lucky that Sasaoka pretended to be M and killed JK16. So I could use the imposter to my advantage. But your computer was mirrored. That's where the guard came in. Yoshihara? He had gambling debts he couldn't repay. So we had a deal. Yoshihara. How big is your debt? I asked him to turn the mirroring off so I could mail my friend. For 10 million yen. You're the real M. How's that? M didn't warn off Sasaoka for posing as him... because M had no access to a computer. In prison. Sorry but I'm not M. Who is then? He's dead. The corpse in the fridge. That's M. He blackmailed me when I tried to ID him, so I killed him. I feel good to get that off my chest! You can't keep running. I'll arrest you one day. I'm looking forward to that. Thanks. You look intense. How's it going? Does it still hurt? Just a little. Lucky it wasn't serious. You saw me at my weakest. No. You tried so hard to protect me. I didn't want to lose you, Minori. I realized that losing you is my worst fear. Manabu... Minori. Never leave me. I have no reason to. They're kissing! Look, they're kissing! Kiss her! Kiss her! They're watching... About my mother... I'll visit her. Can you come too? Sure. So that's why we met here. Let's go. What? I was thinking how lucky I was to drop my phone that day. (Five years ago) Next stop is Yokohama Culture Hall. The bus is leaving now. I'm getting off! Thank you! Oh no... It's in the bus! Oh no. I can't miss my job interview. Wait! Um... Here.
