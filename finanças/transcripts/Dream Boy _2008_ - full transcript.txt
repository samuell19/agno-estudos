Welcome. I hope you'll come back to us. We will. Thank you brother. It's nice to meet you. Why you too, Sir. What is it ? Nothing. We used to live in Lake Charles ... ... but my dad got a job where he moves around a lot. Now we live by the lake on Poke's Road. Well welcome Nathan, thank you. Doesn't look like your daddy's going to make it home for dinner. Father, we come to you in the name of Jesus. We pray for each others needs, as we know them to be ... ... and Father, as you know them to be. Give us the courage and the ability to keep us strong witnesses ... Why don't you come sit here. I got so much stuff to do on top of my homework ... ... I'm about to go crazy. You have to work ? I got chores to do for my dad. I got a prayer group meeting at church ... ... and I got this paper to write in English ... ... and I don't want to. I'm good at that kind of stuff. You are ? I like English. Well I'll come over later and you can help me. It's about railroads, the paper is. I can help with some other stuff, like math. I'm pretty good at math. Okay. See ya. Bye. I like Brother Will. I like him better then Preacher Rutherford. All he does is talk about sinners and going to hell. I'm tired. I was dancing all day. Got to let me come and watch you practice some time. You wanna ride ? Yeah. We should probably go. Alright. You sure it's ok ? Yeah, I was just finishing up my homework while you were doing your chores. Ms. Johnson said you skipped a grade. You supposed to be pretty good at English. Even if you are younger then me. I just hate to write stuff. I like it okay. I copied this down from The World Book Encyclopedia. There's a lot of information here. You should really narrow down your topic. What about just steam engines ? Alright. I thought you boys might want something to drink. Thank you, Ma'am. I guess I ought to be embarrassed getting a kid like you to help me with my homework. I take English with the juniors. It's just one grade below you, I'm not a kid. Why ... I didn't mean it bad. I just mean you're a bit younger then me, that's all. I appreciate the help. You'll like living out here in the summer time. It's real peaceful, nobody comes around. Is it okay to walk in the woods ? Yeah, I go out there all the time. There are some great places out there. Camping grounds, Indian burial mounds ... ... there's even a haunted house and stuff ! I'll show you. I bet you got a lot of work to do, because it's a farm ? Yeah ... it's all outdoor stuff. I like that. What about you, Nathan ? You ever live on a farm before ? No, we lived in towns mostly before. But my dad wanted to live in the country this time. So, why'd you move out here ? Nobody moves to St. Francisville. Well my dad got a job, selling tractors in Shenandoah. You sure do like this school stuff don't you ? It's alright I guess. I don't see how anyone could like school. Beats staying home all the time. So you stay at home too much, huh ? We can fix that. Nathan, it's almost bedtime sweetheart. It's good. Thanks, Nathan. You want to hold onto these for me ? Hey Nathan. Hi. Hey my dad's got a new Marlin ... 30/30. She got some real kick to her. We should take it out this weekend, do us some deer hunting. You ever been hunting before Nathan ? - No. - You should come. Even if you don't kill anything, hunting's fun. We should go out for the whole weekend, camp out. I mean we've been talking about going camping. Yeah well all I say's it's talk because ahh ... ... someone can't get away from the girlfriend for a weekend ... ... spend time with his buddies. Yeah ... you're the hold up Roy. What do you say ? Bye. See ya. I told you I was coming, you forget ? No. Algebra's simple. Learn to work from both sides of the equation. So, Mr. Sawyers' department store sells socks. Six a pair for $1.97. How many nickels in $1.97 ... ... if you have four quarters, six dimes, and two pennies ? Well, first you subtract. Then divide to find the value of X. There is a graveyard over yonder. Can we go there ? Sure you want to ? I want to. Kennicutt's used to own all this land. Thats what people say. There were two Kennicutt plantations. One that burned down ... another one, off in the wood. Why is it called Poke's Road ? Poke's Road stretches a long way. There must have been some Pokes on it once upon a time. Bring my books in the morning. I going home. Where'd you go ? Out back. There's a graveyard out there. By yourself ? No. With the boy next door ... ... Roy. Ahh ... ... he's a nice boy. There's a western on the TV. You ought to come watch it with your daddy. No, Sir. Alright ... Go on to bed. John, Chapter XIII, verses 21-26. Jesus was deeply troubled, and he testified ... ... " One of you will betray me " ... The disciples looked at one another at a loss as to whom he meant. One of his disciple, the one Jesus loved ... ... was reclining at his side. John leaned back on Jesus's chest, and said ... ... " Master, who is it ? " ... And Jesus answered ... ... " It is the one " ... ... " to whom I will hand the morsel " ... ... " after I have dipped it. " ... And so he dipped the morsel and handed it ... ... to Judas. Son of Simon the Iscariot. Let us pray. You coming in ? Yeah. What are you doing after ? I got homework, and I got to run an errand. You want some company ? No, I got to pick up a prescription for my mama ... ... she's waiting on it. - Is she okay ? - Yeah, she is. Do you want to go inside ? Touch me. Did you ever do this before, with anybody ? You promise ? I promise. I've never done this with, anybody. It's okay if it's just me and you. Hi boy. Hi Mom. Hi Nathan. Hi. Roy tells me you just moved here from somewhere ... ... but for the life of me I can't think of where. Lake Charles. Yeah ... ... we used to live in Slidell before that. Then Pearl River. Pearl River's a nice town. Don't you get tired of moving around so much ? Sometimes ... ... but it's alright though. Your family goes to the Baptist church in Clinton ? Yes, Ma'am. You know, we go to The Holiness Church in Jackson. And I just wanted to tell you that your daddy and your mama ... ... and you are welcome to join us anytime. Thanks, Ma'am. I better go look after Roy's daddy. If you boys want anything let me know. Thanks, Ma'am. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you. You want to go riding around town tonight ? I have to ask my mom. I'm sure she'll say yes, if ... you come with me. Hey, Mom. Please Ma'am, I was hoping you might let Nathan come out riding with us tonight. Well you know your daddy don't like you to run around ... ... and we got that church supper tonight. I don't have to go this time do I ? Well ... No. Him and me and church is ... plenty for one night. Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Ma'am. I 'll have him back by eleven o'clock, I promise. Get ready, I'll meet you by my truck. Nathan ... Yes, Mama ? You need some money ? I have five dollars. You know your daddy's been real nervous lately ... ... and I couldn't get him to lay down last night. He didn't rest. So where are we going ? We're going to meet Randy and Burke. You drink beer ? Yeah ... You reckon you can keep quiet about it ? It doesn't bother me that you drink beer. It's okay. Answer my question. I can keep quiet about it. I can keep quiet about anything. We're going swimming. That's where we're going. But I can't swim. You can watch me. Did you see that ride, now quick, in. What did you think about that ? Pretty high. High alright. Bet you won't do it. Bet I won't either. I'm with you Nathan. I ain't jumping off that top part either. I got no need to break my neck. Well I do. Glad you came out here with us Nathan. Leave him alone Burke, he can't swim. Well maybe he'll learn if I through him in. Don't bother him Burke, I mean it ! Are you going to be man enough to jump in this water right now ... ... or am I going to have to throw you in ? - I don't want you to throw me in ! - Then are you going to jump ? - I want you to let me go ! - Leave him alone, let go of him. - I didn't throw him in the water. I should have though. Nice try buddy. Yes it was. What did you think ? Looked like something was chasing you all the way down. I wish I could swim. I'll teach you. Next time it will be just us. Want to go somewhere now ? Want to go to a movie or something ? I don't mind. Do you mind ? What ? Coming out here. No, I don't mind. Maybe we can go to a movie sometime too. I ain't trying to hurt anybody. You ain't hurt nobody. Touch me. Who've you been screwing like that. Huh ? Who taught you to screw like that ? - Answer me ! - Nobody ! - You're lying ! - No, I'm not ! Roy ? Roy, please ... Harland ! Come on downstairs. Nathan ? I'm talking to you Nathan. I know you're awake, I saw your eyes come open. Did you have a good time tonight ? You better answer me, or I'm coming in there. Yes, Sir. Your mama's the one who said it was alright for you to go out. It wasn't me. Where'd you boys go ? Swimming. Did you go swimming too ? No, Sir. That's right, you don't know how. Open your eyes, Nathan. Look at your dad. I'm sleeping. Open your eyes ! Harland ! Harland, what you doing up there ? I talking to Nathan. Come on downstairs, leave him alone, he's tired. Let me check on Nathan for a moment ... ... and I'll be down there in a little while. You promised me, that you wouldn't bother him. I told you it's alright. I'm checking on him to see if he had a good time. You shouldn't let him go out like that. He ought to come to church with us. He can come to church with us on Sunday. Come on downstairs. Please. Come on. Did he touch you ? Did he touch you ?!? Nathan ! you out here ? I called you a couple times. Everything alright ? Yeah, everything's fine. I was kind of hoping I'd get to see you on Friday. I had some stuff that I needed to do. I know that there is something wrong. Why don't you just tell me what it is ? What is it ? Did do something ? - No, nothing, I just got to get home. - Roy ... Please ... Nathan ! Nathan ! Roy ! Come back ! How long have you been out here ? Since after supper. You were out here last night too. Yeah. I got to go inside pretty soon, my parents will be wondering where I am. It's ok, I'll be fine. - You can't stay out here. - Yes I can. You should come to my house. Your parents would send me home. You can sleep in the barn tonight, I'll show a place. You and your folks have a fight ? Yeah ... something like that. You'll be safe in here okay. Thanks. Morning. You sleep ? Yeah. Think your mom's awake. Light's on in your kitchen. I'll hide these. You get ready for school, okay ? Don't run from me ! Get away from him ! So I talked to Burke and Randy. We're going to go camping this weekend. Alright. About time you lazy assholes got here. I see you got your mama to let you come with us. That's good. Nathan ain't no baby. So ... Where we going ? A secret place my uncle showed me. A good long walk in the woods. Pretty far from everything. What the fuck's here ? You'll see. We'll see !? Shut up Burke, enjoy the walk. So much for nice weather. You don't want none for yourself ? No. What's the matter ? Want some more ? No I'm good. Alright, you tell me when partner. A lot of people killed in these woods. Don't start now Roy. No, I mean it. Two men just killed here last summer wasn't it ? That's right. Two of them. Them two suckers from East Baton Rouge. They found one of them hanging upside down with his nuts cut off. You two son of a bitches don't scare me. You know a lot of stories Roy, don't you. What do you say, Randy ? Want to hear some ghost story ? Suit yourself. Alright. So this man from Madisonville ... ... going out with a girl, shouldn't been going out with. She was married. She didn't wanted to leave her husband because ... ... he was a rich man and ... ... they lived in this huge mansion together. So, this man, Jimmy Hicks ... ... decides he's going to kill this guy. Because he wants this girl all to himself. So he drives up to this huge mansion. The door's like nearly twice the size of him. He knocks on the door ... three times. Woman's husband comes out ... ... he pulls a hatchet from behind his back. The guy tries to plead with him but it doesn't make any difference. So he turns and runs ... ... and Jimmy brings the hatchet right down on the guys' back. But he doesn't stop there ... ... he keeps on swinging. He chops the guy up into little bits. With that last swing ... ... cuts the guys hand right off. Now, he decides he's going to bury him ... ... in his own backyard. He takes him out back ... digs a grave, tosses the body in piece by piece. Then when he's finished he remembers ... the bloody hand, with all the fingers ... Damn it Burke ! Cut it out ! But he goes back, and the hand's not there. So he figures he must have buried it. He goes home ... ... take a shower, wash all the blood off. When he comes out it's dead quiet. Hears a knock at the door. He goes up to the peep hole ... ... no one there. So, he figures his mind's just playing tricks on him. He turns, goes to bed. Now sometime in the middle of the night ... ... he wakes up. He can't breathe. He reaches out but there is nobody there. There's a weight, on his throat. He tries to get up ... ... and he goes to the mirror by his bedside ... ... and he sees the hand ... ... wrapped around his throat. Now every now and then ... ... police in Madisonville find two lovers dead. They don't even bother questioning anybody ... ... because they know ... ... it's the curse that was brought on by Jimmy Hicks that done them in. Scared yet, Nathan ? No. Hear that ? Storm's coming in. Better get some more wood for the fire. Come on. - Need some help ? - No, that's okay. Nathan ! What are you looking at ? Nothing. Just listening to the wind. Listen a minute. Wild ! It sounds like someone's voice. It's going to rain. Come on. Thank you for bringing me out here. I used to go camping when I was little with my dad all the time. We don't so much stuff like that any more though. I've never been camping with my dad before. I don't like your dad much. He came out to the barn the other day to talk to me. Talked about you some. He said he noticed we were getting to be good friends. He was glad you were getting out of the house. He said you were too quiet. You live in your head. You stay at home too much. Says you make up things that never happened before. I think he figured out I knew where you were sleeping. Do you mind that I don't do the same thing back to you ? No, I don't mind. Careful, it's slippery. Now go this way. Lets rest for a while. Still got a ways further to walk. It's hot out here. It sure is. Well this place is a little spooky. People don't come out here much anymore. My Uncle Heben used to take me out here when I was little. Where ? What the hell's out here ? There's a farm at the end. Big house. Nobody lives there anymore. No thanks, not yet. - Roy ? - No. Alright, more for myself. Lets walk. This is what I wanted to show you. It's a, plantation house. My dad told me about this place. He saw one time when he was hunting. I didn't know there was ever any plantation out here. Kennicutt's owned it. They were kin to some of the people who owned our farm where you live Nathan. The place is supposed to be haunted. My Uncle Heben says he saw it in a book about Louisiana ghosts. The last full blooded Kennicutt who lived there ... ... got killed by one of the slaves. They cut off his head. Legend has it ... ... he still walks around the place looking for it. My Uncle Heben told me ... ... that every family that's lived there since ... ... has had a tragedy. It's been abandoned for over thirty years. Roy, sounds like you're telling ghost stories again. This is true. I say we go get a closer look. That figures. Let's go upstairs first. Nathan ! You awake, Nathan ? What is that ? What's that down there ? That's blood ain't it ? Looks like it. What's that smell ? - It's sulphur. - How do you know ? They say the devil used to smell like sulphur. Oh, that's real funny. - Shit. - What is that ? - Did you see that ? - Yeah. - I don't see anything. - Shut up ! - He's there. - Where, do you see him ? I think he's full of shit, man. There's nothing out there. Just be quiet ! No man, he's trying to scare us. Son of a bitch. - Give me the flashlight. - No I'll hold onto it. Come on Randy, lets see what's up there. Come on. That just sure scared the shit out of me. Did you really see something ? My uncle told me he saw a ghost here one time. Do you think that's what we saw ? I don't know. But if it is a ghost I bet it's that old man. If someone cut my head, I would want it back. There's more ghosts then that. How do you know ? I don't, it just ... just feels like there are all kinds of ghosts. You try to scare me now ? No. But this place does feel like there's people in it. Don't you think so ? I don't know. Have you ever been to a place ... ... where it feels like you've been there before ? No. You feel like you been here before ? Not quite. More like I'll never leave. Nathan ! What is it ? Nothing. I thought I heard something. It's probably he guys. Do you remember what we did when you were a little boy ? What is it ? What's wrong ? What do you see ? I thought I saw somebody. Don't look. I don't know what it is you see, but don't look anymore. What are you doing ? So ! - This is what you guys do ? - Get the hell out of here. - Did you see that Randy ? - Yeah. Looks like Roy sucks dick pretty good. Jesus Roy ! You do that to him ? Get away !!! Nathan ? I saw you ! When Roy had your dick in his mouth. When he was in front of you, on his knees. Did you suck his cock ? I wasn't doing that. It wasn't like that. Yes it was ! You don't like me do you ? You're not going nowhere. Jesus ... Jesus he's dead ain't he ? Go catch up with Burke. You figure it happened like Burke said ? I don't trust nothing Burke said. Go on now. He's over here Mr Davies. ... and He shall dwell with them ... ... and they will be his people ... ... and He will be their God ... ... and God shall wipe away ... ... all tear from their eyes ... ... and there will be no more death ... ... neither sorrow ... ... nor crying ... ... neither shall there be any more pain ... ... for the former things are past away ... ... and He that sat on the throne said ... " Behold, I make all things new " Nathan !
