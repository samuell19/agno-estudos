Look what I found. Candy! Gunnery Sergeant Gorski. Yes, ma'am? I'm confident my daughter will appreciate some female company. - Yes, ma'am. - Shall we proceed, Mr. Laughlin? Come on, Nira. Let's get comfy. Secure VIP's daughter in Eagle Three. Copy that, Chief. Mr. Collins, let's go over the presentation. This is so pretty. All teams, this is Six. Radio check. Over. Eagle One, Roger. Out. Eagle Two, Roger. Out. Eagle Three, Roger. Out. Eagle Four, Roger. Out. Eagle Nine, this is Eagle Six. Radio check, over. How come there's so many cars with us today? To make sure you and your mommy are super safe. Okay. Can I have another piece of candy? - You're gonna get me in trouble. - Yes. All right, just one. Thank you. We may have a situation. Grouping in the woods at three o'clock. Yeah, that's an all clear. Holy... No! Johnson, take the lead! Go, go, go! - Ali? - Nothing is gonna happen to you, okay? Nothing is gonna happen to you. Is Nira all right? Back it up! Back it up! Back it up! All right, sweetie. Sweetie, I need you to sit here and stay low, okay? Come on. Let's go! - Mommy! - It's okay. - So when'd you get back? - To New York? About a week. Do you have a place to stay? What about a job? Hmm. It wasn't exactly a parade welcoming me home. Well, I missed you at the funeral. They wouldn't let me go. What, for your sister? Non sibi sed patriae. - Not self, but country and all that. - That's Navy, not us. It seemed to make sense at the time. You know, the kids would benefit from having their aunt around. Any interest in seeing them? Jon? Okay then. There's an opening at the apartment building where I'm working. It's not much, but it's something. They're doing major renovations. You get the job, hardly anybody will be there. Not quite as exciting as where you've been. You know, when we fought in Vietnam, we saw a lot of things. After the war, the only people who really understood what we went through... were the other soldiers. There's groups you can talk to. Don't worry. I'm fine. I'll check out this job. I missed you, Uncle Pat. I owe you a couple of Mets tickets. Not until they got a team worth watching. Hey, so where do I find Borz Blasevic? In the locker room. Take the elevator down to the basement, go left through the fire doors. You'll see it. And don't tell him we're related. - He'll go easier on you. - All right. Hey, Uncle Pat. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. - You're Gorski? - Yes, Sir. Pat told me you were coming. He's a nice guy. - Don't you think? - Yes, Sir. You can put your stuff... here. Sorry about this. We're all unisex here. This is what I love about Rachmaninoff. He's so unexpected. I feel the same way about Dylan. - Thomas? - Bob. You're not a fan of classical work, are you? Not exactly, sir. You can cut the "sir" crap. We have enough kissing up to do here already. We don't have to do it to each other. We'll use the next two days to get you acclimated. You get the Easter weekend off. Everyone will be out of the building, SO you won't miss much. You come back to work on Monday. There will be more babysitting The Carrington while it gets a facelift. Think you can handle that? I'll do my best, sir. Good. - Let's go, let's go! - Holiday! Hey! I may be old-fashioned, but a woman doorman? We're trying to modernize our image at The Carrington, sir. I'm sorry. Here, let me help you with those. - Oh, no. I got them. - I insist, I insist. Thank you. You're not moving during the remodeling? Borz was kind enough to arrange an exception for us. Poor Bernard had a stroke seven years ago. You know how old fogies feel about change. Old fogies. Come on, you're not that old. You're kind. A liar, but kind nevertheless. Oh, that was very helpful, dear. You know, your sister never stopped talking about you. - Now I know why. - Wait. How do you know my sister? Well, you're Ali, right? Your sister and family lived in the building. Her husband and kids still do. Where is he? 10C. Oh, lovely family, but tragic what they've lived through. Have a happy Easter. Why didn't you tell me? Well, I was gonna... You know, I thought being close to family might... might be, you know... nice. - Max, get the door. - I'm busy. Max, I swear to God, I'm gonna throw that game out the window. - What? - Is your father home by any chance? It's for you. Well, who is it? I'm working. - Ali. - What the hell is going on? - You tell me. Are you working here? - Yeah. And that has nothing to do with you? No. Damn it, Uncle Pat. - You want to come in? - No. I did not ask for this. Believe me, I had no idea you were gonna end up here. - Jasper! - No. Jasper! Damn it. Lily, how many times? Words. We have to find him. Uh, look, I've got to get this. It's my publisher in London. We've been missing each other all morning. Can you just... I won't be long. Do you need help? Jasper could be anywhere by now. We need Max. - Come on! - Oh! Okay. Max! Go away. Lily, what the hell? Jasper escaped again. We need your help. Get out! I don't have time to look for your stupid cat. If you don't help us, I'll tell Dad that you're smoking marijuana again. Jasper! Jasper, come here. There's 63 apartments on ten floors, all of them open for the contractor. This is gonna take forever. Max collected all of the blueprints for The Carrington - when he was a Boy Scout. - Max, a Boy Scout? I can see that. Jasper? Jasper? Jasper! Where are you? Where'd your brother go? Max? Max, this isn't funny. Max, where'd you go? - Max... - Ahh! Butt brain! Where did you even come from anyway? A secret door. Building's full of them. Servants used them to get from room to room. Huh. Jasper! - What's your name anyhow? - Ali. Aunt Ali? Mommy told us all about you. - She did? - Yeah, you were her hero. So how do we find Jasper anyway? Jasper... Let's check the basement. That's Jasper. What's through this wall? They were building a subway tunnel under The Carrington. Ran out of money in the '40s, sealed it up. Jasper. Jasper! Please be okay. Max, give me your phone. There he is. - What do we do? - Now, let's see. What's she doing? Do not try this at home. I didn't think we'd ever see Jasper again, but then Aunt Ali dropped into the hole like Spider-Man and saved him. - Really? - Yep. Your aunt was always full of surprises. Right. You, go in and get started on Mommy's mint sauce, and I'll join you in a minute. Will you come to Easter dinner tomorrow? I'm cooking it. Lily, I would love that but... You got to eat. It'll give us a chance to reconnect. I don't want to reconnect. I'm taking the kids back to the UK on Monday. During the construction, you'll have the place to yourself without us. The only reason we stayed so long was Lily wanted to make an Easter dinner here. Like her mother did. I know. We weren't really in touch, and ll... I didn't know what to say. Please, Ali? You're still here, buddy? Your shift ended over an hour ago. Don't you have an Easter feast waiting for you somewhere? I promised Mrs. Hersch I'd fix her microwave before I went home. That's thoughtful of you. Yeah, well, I don't want to disappoint her. Do you wanna share a beer? - Start the celebration. - Yeah, sure. Hey, hey, tilt the glass. You never poured a beer before? Like this? - Is that better? - Yeah. A better tilt? So what's your plans tonight? At home. TV, bed. - No party? - No party. Okay. Here's some beer, at least. - You're back already. - I am. I told you to take the holiday off. The Stantons invited me for dinner. - You work fast. - Sheer force of my personality maybe. You're staying in? Yeah. Home-cooked meal. Trust me, I would welcome any chance to duck out, but I promised, so... Okay. You want me to save you some pie? It's fresh from the deli. No, it's okay. I'm on a diet. Your loss. Have fun. Shall we begin? Jammer's set. Good to go. Cut it. Cut it. Cut the blue one. Let me handle it. I got it, I got it. Please. Thank you. Whoa! Whoo! Rock and roll. - What's this? - Something I made for you. Wait, Lily, this is amazing. How did you draw this? It looks exactly like me. I used a picture of you and Daddy. Where'd you find this? In Daddy's memory book. Don't you like it? Yeah. No, I love it. It's amazing. Thank you so much. I am gonna put it right up here so that everyone can enjoy it. Do you think they'll like it? Of course. Speaking of everyone, where is your father? - He's busy. - He's always busy. Your mommy told me a story. Do you know what water wings are? Daddy made me wear them when I learned to swim. It's so frustrating. Can you imagine wearing them every single day? I wouldn't cope. I'd die. What if I told you that your daddy used to wear them every single time he left the house? - You're kidding. - It's true. Your grandma lived in a house with a really big lake, so every time your daddy wanted to go out and play, she made him wear them. You're kidding! So, every time you get a little mad at your dad, just remember... - water wings. - Water wings. Mm-hmm. Sorry, I had a deadline. Finally got the publisher off my back. Okay. What are you doing? Shh. Help your sister. Did I miss something? What? No. Miss something? Here? - Nothing at all. - There's nothing to miss. - Just talking about vegetables. - Love vegetables. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. That must be Pat to fix the microwave. Oh, Borz! - Happy Easter. - Happy Easter. What can I do for you? - You have a visitor. - I wasn't expecting one. It's an old friend of your husband. A friend of Bernard's? Good evening. - Oh! - My name is Victor Dubois. I happen to be in town briefly for the holiday and wanted to stop by. I hope this is not too much of an inconvenience. Oh, of course not! Oh, come in, come in. Can I get you anything? Some tea? - We have plenty of food. - Some tea would be delightful. My old friend. Bernard hardly says a word since the stroke. The doctors say it triggered akinetic mutism. Now Mr. Dubois, how do you know my husband? We worked together in Berlin over 30 years ago. My Bernard? Oh, no, that's not possible. He went by the name of Erich Dreischler then. - I'm afraid you have the wrong person. - I'm afraid not. Erich. Mr. Dubois, my husband doesn't speak French. - He's never even been to Europe. - Erich? Borz? What is this about? Sit down. Sit down. It seems there's a lot you don't know about your husband, Mrs. Hersch. I can't wait until dinner. I'm starving. So, what was it like over there? It was... it was great. Did you kill anyone? Max, don't be an imbecile. That's totally out of line. No, it's... it's fine. Yeah. Yes, I did. Cool. More wine? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Just open another bottle. I just wish everything could go back to the way it was before Mommy died. So, uh, how long do these go in for? About 50 minutes. They'll be... fine when you take them out. Dreischler, I know everything. I told you, we don't know anything. Would you like some help? Not yet. Erich. What about now? Refresh his memory. He's a tough old guy. He's had a stroke. - Sit down. Sit down! - He can't feel a thing on that side of his body. Try the other side. That's better. Dubois. Welcome back, Herr Dreischler. In the wall. Which wall? Point to it. Here. Oh, no, no, no. Here. I don't know. Please! Gentlemen, you can enter. I don't know! Copy that. So it's in the walls. Let's get started. What does this bring to mind? Wagner. - Duvall. - Apocalypse Now. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. Nice view. Yeah, it was a big selling point. The sauce tastes really... The mint sauce. It's all right, it's all right. We'll make do without. It's okay. That was Mommy's favorite. We can't have Easter dinner without the mint sauce. That was Mommy's favorite. - We can't, we just can't. - It's okay. Max, are you stoned? You get sloshed. I get stoned. What's the big deal? One's legal, one isn't. Go to your room. Wait, so... she spills mint sauce on me, and I'm the one who's sent to my room? When Mom was here, she never would've dealt with this shit. Mom isn't here. I'm here, and you're just gonna have to get used to that. Yeah. Of course Mom's not here. - Thanks to you. - Max, go to your room now. Why couldn't you have been the one who died? Fuck this shit. I'm sorry you had to witness that. I've seen worse. Lily, the Hersches are still here, and I bet they have loads of spare mint sauce. What do you say, huh? But it won't have pine nuts. I bet you I can find those too. Hey, Ali, can you just wait a moment? - Sure. - Sweetheart, why don't you get a sponge and a towel from the kitchen? I'll help you clean up. Damn it! It's empty. No! Where are they? We don't know what you're looking for. Please, we've lived in this apartment for seven years, and if there was something here, I would know about it. You've been living here for seven years? My records indicate that you lived at The Carrington for close to 30. We used to live upstairs. When Bernard had his stroke, we wanted something on the ground floor, so we moved down here. There you have it. And which apartment did you used to live in? - 10C. - 10C. Thank you, Mrs. Hersch, for your cooperation. 10C is occupied. - Occupied? - They delayed their move until Monday. He's a professor with two kids. You informed me the building would be empty except for the Hersches. It's ten floors up. - I didn't think that... - That's right. You didn't think. Well, do so now. Figure out what to do with them. - Let's go. - Pack it up. I got these. Even that hoodlum sees you for the vain brute you are. So now you talk? I can't tell you what it means to the kids for you to be here. They have a unique way of showing it, don't they? Well, you should see them on a bad day. I'm sorry, Ali. I mean, I feel blessed with my kids and the time I had with Kate. But your sister wasn't the easiest person. Yeah, you married her. Yeah, you're right. We went through a rough patch. I turned to you. I was wrong to do so. - Please, can we not... - No, I thought about this for years. Just hear me out. You saw me as the man I wanted to be. You made me feel... You made me feel. And then I wake up one morning, and you've gone. What am I supposed to think? I went off to serve my country. Oh, come on. That's an absurd rationalization if ever I've heard one. I understand. You're in pain. But I was never gonna be the person to ruin my sister's marriage. How do you think I felt? What, so you sign up as a lifer in the Marines? It's almost a cliche. What do you want from me? Ali, I never meant to hurt you. To be honest, I don't really care anymore. But I do. I am going to get Lily some mint sauce now. Mrs. Hersch? Mrs. Hersch? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Borz. Borz, are you there? Hello? Borz, call the police. The Hersches are dead. I cannot hear you. Can you please come to the lobby? Hello? Shit. Ali? Ali, did you get it? Hello, young lady. - Daddy. - Hey, what's going on? Hey, who are you? Good evening. My name is Victor Dubois. Sorry for the unannounced arrival. I promise our visit will be as brief as humanly possible. - Who are they? - It's okay, sweetie. We do what they say and everything will be fine. - What if it isn't fine? - Shh... Borz, what's going on? I just tried to call you. The intercom is not working. The phones are down. I don't know. The Hersches are dead. - What? - Call the police. Fuck. Come on, come on. Come on. - This is a big place. - Yeah, this may take a while. - Get the tools out. - I got these. Let's go. Let's get moving. No need to hide your phone. You'll find there is no service. Quite the collection you have here. A fan of European history, are you? I teach it at Columbia. Oh. A professor. Goya. One of Los Caprichos. Very good taste, Mr. Stanton. You know your art. I admire how an artist can dip his brush into his soul and capture his times in paintings. It appears Goya captured our times as well. The picture's called The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. Hi, guys. - Hi, Jon. - Borz. - What is this about? - It'll be fine. Pee-Wee, there's a girl trapped in the elevator on the eighth floor. He's talking about Ali. Can you go take care of it? Everything okay? - Everything's super. - Ah. Hi, Lily. Happy Easter. Hi, Borz. Where's Max? He's with his aunt for Easter in the Hamptons. Max? I find it interesting that you set up a place for him here at your table. Go find him. Hey, buddy. - We can start the work, Martinez. - Copy. Okay, let's start here, here and here. - Hey, what are you doing? - Shut up! Sit down. Hey, sweet thing. I smell you. Oh, yeah. Who are you and what do you want? Where are you? You're a twisted bitch, ain't you? You're not a Virgo, are you? I dated one of those. Always had to choose the movies. It was a disaster. I'm a Gemini. What are you? I'm a Scorpio. It would never work. Max? Pee-Wee? Pee-Wee? Please, just stop. Nothing in this wall. Tell me what you want. I'll give you anything, just leave us alone. I appreciate your kind offer, but in this instance, I don't believe you can be of assistance. Pee-Wee, come in. - What's going on? - Pee-Wee's not answering. Take Leo and check it out. Perhaps it is just a problem with Pee-Wee's radio. As you taught me, it's better to cover every scenario. And when you're down in the lobby, turn the elevators on so we can use them. And what scenario am I missing? There's a doorman in the building. It's just a girl. It's nothing to worry about. Max, what happened? Sweetie, I am sorry that you had to see that, but I need you to focus. Tell me everything that you know. Max. You killed him. Listen, the only thing that matters right now is where he came from and how we can stop them. A bunch of guys with guns broke into our apartment. They've got my dad and sister. Okay. How many guys? I don't know. Four, maybe five. Borz is with them. - I figured. - And some French dude. I think he might be their leader. This is so twisted. Focus, Max. You know your way around this building. I don't. I need you. Your family needs you. What would they want in your apartment anyway? I'm telling you, man, this shit is messed up. Did you see Borz cutting that old man's leg? He was enjoying that shit. You saw it. I don't know, man. I don't know if this job is worth it. Hey, how much you getting paid anyway? Twenty-five? What, thirty? Borz, come in. Yeah, copy. We found Pee-Wee. He's dead. This is how you have things under control? - Find her and kill her. - Copy. - Go, go, go. - What was that? Go, go. I see 'em! Get 'em! Max? There's a room behind one of these walls. Pat told me. He called it a hidden sanctuary. I got it. I got it. Not exactly the sanctuary I was expecting. Borz? Borz, come in. - Copy. - I got 'em. We lost them. You lost them? Who's "them"? - She's got a kid with her. - It's Max. She's armed. Keep looking. - You know Morse? - I was a Scout once. - So what is this place? - It's a speakeasy. During Prohibition, residents would meet here in secret to get wasted. Not on my watch. Come on. What are you doing? - You're not my mom. - Exactly. Sit down. How'd she get into the building? - I let her in. - Really? Yeah, she was having dinner here with the Stantons, and [... Thought she was on the tenth floor? - Yeah. - You idiot. So, she was having dinner here? What light can you shed on our mysterious lady? Nothing. I just met her. You invited a stranger to share Easter dinner? She must be very beautiful. She helped my children save Jasper, our cat. She's new here. It was the least we could do. Who is this doorwoman? You have a name? Ali. Ali what? Her full name... Something Polish. Gorski. - Oh. - What? "Gunnery Sergeant Alexandra Gorski of the Marine Security Guard brigade received a Silver Star for her actions on October 15, 2019 during a terrorist ambush on the ambassador's convoy in Bucharest, Romania. Gorski is only the third female soldier to receive the award for exceptional valor since World War ll." What's a decorated soldier doing here as a doorman? Why didn't you talk to my mom? That's a long story. What about my dad? You guys clearly knew each other. He was kind of an ass. Yeah, still is. I didn't mean that. He is a good man. My dad's a pussy. No, he's not. You don't know anything about him. A dad raising two kids on his own is not a coward. My mom and dad were driving back from the theater. I was on the phone with my mom when the car slid off the road into the lake. My mom was trapped inside. Dad made it out. She didn't. I'm sure that he tried everything that he could. I was on the phone with her for a full minute as the car filled with water. What was he doing all that time? He should've done more. - Don't you think he... - He didn't fucking try hard enough! Did you hear that? Hey. Don't be ashamed. I've seen plenty of tough guys cry. I'm not my father. Max, what the hell? Christ. Give me that! Are you out of your goddamn mind? Let's go. Please tell me there's another way out of this room. Check this out. What is it? This is how they got the liquor up here without anybody noticing. Come on. It's our way out of here. Okay. Okay. Well, there are six more rooms. If we have to tear down every wall, we're gonna be here until Christmas. So what now, Mr. Dubois? They're here. They have to be. Okay, slowly. Slowly. Watch out, man, I got this. Go! You have amassed quite a library over the years, Mr. Stanton. The books I've collected have been an important part of my work. With a distinct bent towards British history. Well, you can take the boy out of England, but you can't take England out of the boy. You must have spent a small fortune to build shelves capable of storing your collection. The former tenant built the library. It was one of the main reasons why we bought this place. What the hell are you doing? I never knew Dreischler to be a big reader. - Dreischler? - Your Mr. Hersch. Borz, get the tools! A customized Mosler from the early '80s, four-wheel combination lock. This isn't gonna be easy. How long? Good safecracker would get you inside within five hours. - I'll do it in two. - Do it in one. No, no, no. We need the water to cool the drill bit, man. Yeah. Grab the hose and hook it up in the kitchen. You're telling me what to do now? Who put you in charge? Get him what he needs. I opened a vintage bottle of wine for the holidays. Would you care to join me for a glass? That would be splendid. Would you like some? Huh. I'll take that as a no. Here we are, Mr. Dubois. Enjoy. Mm. That's an old Italian. I prefer Bordeaux. - Hmm. - It was a gift. I'm not much of a connoisseur myself. Sweetheart, can you hold this for a second? Not like your video games, is it? Turn around. I've been wondering how long ago you met Mr. Hersch. Why do you ask? Oh, just habit. Too many years in research libraries. My wife used to say I asked too many questions. Over 30 years. Oh, interesting. A Frenchman and a German. Is the water running? What's it look like? Historically speaking, you haven't always gotten along. We had common business interests. Oh, Borz. Uh, where did you meet him? He doesn't strike me as intelligent enough to move in your circles. Let me guess. Uh, prison? You've done a splendid job of deduction, Mr. Stanton. Borz and I did meet in prison. I don't think you should give him this kind of information. Down, Borz. It is okay. Borz, I need a hand. Coming. - Damn it. - They locked us in. Phones are dead. Hey, do you know where the main panel is? Yeah, control room. This way. Okay, well, you can forget about getting the phone lines to work again. What about the fire alarm? That's a good idea. Okay. Okay. Boom. One down! May I ask... what you're looking for? Perhaps I can help. What have you learned is my passion? Well, your love for art. And how long ago did I meet Mr. Hersch? Over 30 years. In East Germany, to be precise. And you, the learned scholar, can you tell me what were the most prominent events there at that time? The last days of the German Democratic Republic, the fall of East Berlin, the Wall coming down. Bravo. Dreischler... I mean, your Mr. Hersch was in charge of the KoKo program, requisitioning the most valuable assets of East German citizens. I see. And you were brought in to fence them off, to finance a bankrupt government. I was trying to save those works so the rest of the world could enjoy them. If it weren't for my efforts, they could have been lost forever behind an Iron Curtain. Gosh, you delude yourself. I came to take what is mine, Professor! I paid for it with the best years of my life. Hey! What are you doing? Give me that. What? So what do we do now? Delete it. - You come here. - No, don't touch my daughter! Daddy! Yeah, come on. Come on. - Stop! - Come on. Come on. Remember, we are civilized. You talk too much. Delete it! Okay. All right, pull that. Got it. Let's go. What is that? It's the fire alarm. I know it's the fire alarm, you idiot. I specifically instructed you to disable it. I'll handle it. Ali? Can you come in here for a second? Drop the guns. Slowly. Step away from the door. Behind the wall. One word from you, and I'll shoot the kid. Understood? - Come on! - I'm coming. Sorry. - What's going on here? - Hey. Um... Just a false alarm. What do you mean it's a false alarm? Some of the contractors might have crossed the wires. Something. I don't know. Why is the door locked? There's no one else here because of the remodel, except for some construction guys. You can't lock the door. It's illegal and it's dangerous. Yeah, but the entire building is locked down. It's closed up, so we're using the service doors. What did I miss? - Well... It's a false alarm. City regulations say we gotta check it. - Floor by floor. - Ten floors? Go ahead. Come on, Captain. Easter dinner's getting cold at the station. Hey, regulations is regulations. Come on, Chief. Give your guys a break. We can bend the rules a little. Clearly there's nothing wrong here. Absolutely not. False alarm, a hundred percent. All right. You just keep your carpenters away from my fire alarm system. Absolutely. Won't happen again, sir. Let's go. Hey, another false alarm and you'll get fined. Thank you very much, sir. I highly appreciate it. Okay, party's over. Thank you. Happy Easter! Nice try, Gorski. You aroused my curiosity, though. Why would a decorated officer hole up here as a doorman? To meet interesting people like you. I had a friend... that came back after war, and he was damaged. Are you damaged, soldier? Not as damaged as you. What about this... Get their guns! Take the gun. Max, give me the rifle. Find a way out. You go that way. Come on. Get her! There she is! Hey! Find the kid. I'm gonna kill that bitch. Yeah, the car runs on an app, and the app needs a signal. - Oh, my God. - Right. So halfway up a mountain, no one for miles... Officer. What is it? You okay? There are terrorists in The Carrington. You've got to call police, SWAT, everyone. Hold on, hold on. Terrorists in The Carrington? My dad and sister, they've been kidnapped. Kidnapped? This is 105 Charlie. I got a 10-10 here at 85th and Central Park West. Yeah, there's a kid that claims The Carrington's been taken over by terrorists. - What's your name? - Max Stanton. His name is Max Stanton. They want to speak to you. - Hello? - Hello, Max. We miss you up here. Let's go, kid. - Stay back. - Whoa! Hold on, easy. How about you give me that gun, kid? - I'll shoot you, you cocksucker. - Yeah? You gonna spray my brains all over the car? Good boy. How's it going? Huh? Ms. Gorski. Ms. Gorski? Ms. Gorski, can you hear me? Whoever you are and whatever you're up to, you should walk away now. Someone's bringing in the police to bring you down. And if they don't stop you, I will. Things don't always work out as we might wish. You, of all people, should understand that, Sergeant Gorski. By the way, I have someone here who wants to say hello. I'm sorry, Ali. The Internet is a marvelous invention. I was fascinated to read about what happened while you were in the service at the embassy. Unless you want more innocent blood on your hands, be here in 15 minutes, unarmed, and surrender. It's over. Come on, come on. Now, right? Like, that's nothing. Two! Whoo! Ali? Nothing's going to happen to you, okay? Nothing's going to happen to you. Why did you stop? There's no water and we need water. Check the faucet. Nothing. Leo! - Yeah? - Can you check the bathroom? - No water in the bathroom. - Is that bitch in the basement? We have no time for this. Keep drilling. Uh, no. No, no, no. You see, the drill bit, it'll break. We need the water to keep it cool. Keep drilling! That's an order. Okay. Okay. I've got... We need water. Merde. He created this mess, you fix it. Go! Turn on the water. Yes, sir. Leo, what's going on? What's taking so long? You know, we are so, so close. I mean, I'm on the last lock. Come on. Leo? He's dead and you're next. It seems your doorwoman friend is more effective than you gave her credit. I hear your putdowns. I don't hear any solutions. What? Try this one. For someone like me who appreciates fine art, I can say your daughter has real talent. There is a certain likeness in her drawing to this photo. If you just met Sergeant Gorski, why there is a photo of you together when you were younger? I noticed your daughter's signature and her reference to "Aunt Ali." I assume you are related to the war hero killing all my men. Aunt Ali is smarter and stronger than all of you. Honey. Honey, come here. Did I say something wrong? - No. - No. Quite to the contrary. You said something right. Thank you. It appears you have been withholding important information from us. I understand this kind of publicity can get you discharged from the military. Isn't that true, Aunt Ali? - Let them go, or I will... - Listen to me. For every ten minutes that pass without water, a member of your family will lose a limb. Now, turn on the water! Wait! The main water valve has been destroyed. But I have a plan. Aunt Ali! Welcome, Sergeant Gorski. I am Victor Dubois. I accept your total surrender. Now listen to me, Victor. Once I get the water, you release my family, and if you don't... I will take you to hell. I'm impressed someone in your position negotiates from an illusion of strength. We have already established our terms. Now, the water. Officer Olsen, get up here. Now we wait. - We're back! - Good. We got water! I kept up my end of the bargain. Now it's yours. We're in! We are in. We... are... in. Okay. Careful. Yeah. - Very good. - Remove the box. Yes, sir. Is that what you were after? Nothing is... as it appears, Mr. Stanton. It's a Caravaggio. The Nativity with St. Francis. Rembrandt. It's a bloody Rembrandt. Bring the tubes. Be careful. Roll them gently. Do you know how much these paintings are worth? - How much? - Borz, time is of the essence. I don't know, $60 to $80 million. These paintings are worth $80 million? No, no, no. Each one. You told me these paintings were worth $5 million max... We have an agreement. Said fee for services rendered. End of discussion. Lily! Lily, get down. We don't have time for this. I absolutely agree. Pull the trigger and see what happens. Do either of you know how to move fine art? Do you know? Twenty-five percent for the both of us, 50% for you. Or we can all go down here. You're really coming into your own, you know that? - Let's go. - Okay. - Get up. Get up! - Okay. Nobody moves! - No, no, no. Max! - Sit down! Sit the fuck down! Or I shoot the kid. Let him go. See, this is where we're different. Martinez. Yeah? Guess it's a fifty-fifty. What? - Dad! - No! Daddy! You should've taken a day off. No! Quick, quick! Dad! Dad, are you all right? It's okay. I underestimated you. Yeah, and I, you. Your dad's gonna be fine, but right now, I need you to be his water wings, okay? So grab this. Right here, hold it down. - Daddy? Daddy. - I'm okay. - Daddy, I... - I'm all right. I'm okay. Max, are you okay? I'm fine. Go get 'em. I'm gonna be okay. Go! Go! Go! - Hold it. - Oh, my God! Don't shoot. - Hold it right there. - I'm a doorman. I'm just a doorman. A woman went crazy. She took her family hostage upstairs. She's coming down the stairs right now. She's got a gun! Alpha team, spread out. Move to the exit, sir. Move. Move, move, move. Seal the street. The building's surrounded. Plan B. Drop your weapon! Wait, wait. My brother-in-law is wounded on the tenth floor. - He needs a medic. - Drop it now! Please, it's not me. It's Borz, the doorman. Step away from the weapon and stand up slowly. I'm happy, Borz. You've changed. Merde. Yes, I have. One hundred percent. Borz. Borz! You're persistent, Sergeant. I'll give you that. We have enough kissing ass to do around here. We don't have to do it to each other. Let's finish this. What are you doing? No, no, no! No! No! Are you crazy?! I knew you were sick. I just didn't realize how sick you were. Well, now you know. Fuck. Right. Do we have everything? Good. Hey, you. I didn't think I'd see you again. Thought you'd get rid of me that easily, huh? How is he? He's all right. I'm sorry, Ali. This is all my fault. I couldn't do it. Do what? Use the gun. I wasn't the man you wanted me to be. I really like the man you are. Come on. - Aunt Ali! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. I got you something. The mint sauce. With pine nuts, of course. Where's the lamb? The lamb. I knew I forgot something. How are you? Oh, I'll manage. In a couple of weeks, I'll be back to my usual boring self. - Sir, we should go. - All right. Jump in. Bye, Aunt Ali. What are you gonna do? Well, I won't be working as a doorman. We'll be back after they finish the renovations. Maybe you can join us in London if you're interested. I know the kids would love to see you. The kids? What about you? See? I'm one of those tough guys who can cry. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Bye, Aunt Ali! We'll miss you.
