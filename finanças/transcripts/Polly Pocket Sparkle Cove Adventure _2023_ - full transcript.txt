A long time ago, there was a woman named Prudence Pocket. She was the greatest hero ever! Prudence found a magical crystal called pockite, which gave her tiny power: the ability to shrink. She put the purple pockite into a locket and gave it to her daughter. The locket went through the generations until it got to Penelope Pocket. That's my Grandma. And she gave it to me. I'm Polly Pocket. And I've been using the locket to have all sorts of adventures. I thought that purple shrinking pockite was the coolest, but then I went to this Mermaid Kingdom and learned that there are different colors of pockite, that each have a special power. Blue pockite creates shields. Orange lets you transform. Green is teleportation. It can take you anywhere in our world and beyond. Like even to a magical cloud land filled with unicorns. The mermaids gave me this green pockite, which is how we got here. But if I find more colors, we'll go on even more amazing adventures. What my friend is taking a really long time to ask is, do you have any pockite in this world? Oh. Thanks anyway, unicorns. Go to home! Whoa. That was a lot to take in. There has to be clues about the other pockite Prudence found. Whoa! Hmm. Here, Prudence has the locket. Yeah, but then she… Whoa! …disappears from the history books. Whoa! And that's why I have so many whys! Why didn't she put the other pockite she found in the locket? Why did she pass on only purple shrinking pockite? Mmm. Grandma! Go big! Oh. Girls, I want you to meet an old friend. This is Plum. Plum, meet my granddaughter, Polly, and her friends, Lila and Shani. I am so very pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Plum, the magical flying seahorse that my grandma never mentioned. Oh, let me explain everything. I am a magical Cuddly and official guide and companion for the wielder of the purple pockite in the Sparkle Cove Protector Tournament. Well, this should explain it better. The pink pockite powered projector. Hello! I'm Tine and I want to tell you all about our island, Sparkle Cove, the origin of all pockite. This island is overseen by the Protector, whose job it is to guard against intruders, help pockite wielders throughout the cosmos, and to ensure that the island remains harmonious and balanced. We've come to the end of our Protector's ten-year term. And you are invited to participate in the Sparkle Cove Tournament. Whoever wins will be the new Protector. I hope to see you soon. I can't believe it's time for you to compete. Wait, Grandma, did you compete? I tried. That's when I came up with my motto: Even if I end up dead last, Penelope Pocket will still have a blast. What about Prudence? Did she compete? Is that how she got all the colors of pockite? "Prudence" doesn't ring a bell, but information on past competitors can be found in our extensive library. Extensive library? Sun, sand, and sparkles? I'm in. Ooh. Only the competitor can go. That is, if she agrees to? A tournament on a magical island? This was not covered in any of the parenting books. Oh, she'll be fine, Peter. Plum will be with her the whole time. Yes, as Polly's Cuddly, I'll take care of her and make sure she follows the rules. Plus, you'll be able to watch her during the tournament. Well, we must be going. Oh. That's my shellphone. One moment. Uh, carry on with your goodbyes. This is Plum. Oh, I see. Send a post card. Oh. Bye, Polly-pie. Bye-bye! I have a motto for you, Polly: When to your strengths you are true, this tourney will be a success no matter how you do. - Oh, wish we could be there. - Be safe! Have fun! Oh, and reapply sunscreen every two hours. Thank you for telling me. Goodbye. Oh, dear. The vocalist for the Sparkle Cove Anthem has a terrible case of can't-sing-itis. What are we going to do? Me-me-me-me! I even have experience singing opening anthems. Well, this is a hard one. But since you'd be there on official business and not a guest of Polly's, and it is my responsibility to find a new vocalist, I suppose you can come. But you'll have to memorize this song by the afternoon. What about me? Oh, that's easy. Absolutely not! I have to uphold the rules. Oh, so unfair. But I have cool things to do too. Like sitting here and watching Polly compete. All right. Off we go. Polly, would you like to Pocket-size us? Tiny power! Right over here. I'd know if my yard has an entrance to a magical island. Those of us born on Sparkle Cove have Pocket Vision to detect otherwise unseen Pocket Worlds. Touch my fin and you'll see it too. The entrance to Sparkle Cove! - Whoa. - Wow. Go big! - It's beautiful. - Ooh. I'll show you to your rooms on that boat. Stop that monkey! Jake, wait up. Can't. That monkey stole my shoe! Whoa! Eek! "Jake," is it? When you have a fashion emergency… …Polly Pocket and Shani Smith are on the case. Ouch! Go shields! Nice. Blue shield pockite? Yeah. Oh, he's getting away. Wait! This is not on my agenda! He's too high. Actually… Tiny power! Gotcha. That was amazing! Thank you. - Whoa. - Ooh. What is this thing? - Excuse me! - Oh! The Golden Geyser is off limits! Oh! Protector Tarak! Apologies. We were collecting our competitors. Cobalt, it's your duty to ensure Jake doesn't break the rules. What about your competitor, Plum? Please step away from the Golden Geyser. It must never be tampered with. That could be very dangerous. We understand. And nice to meet you, Protector Tarak. No need for that. Just be careful. Ah! It's almost time for the opening ceremonies. Better get you to the boat to prepare. But I haven't learned the song yet. I haven't heard the song yet. Whoa! This is your dorm. Please quickly prepare for the ceremony. Can we teleport home, like, super quick and tell Lila about this? I am afraid that's against the rules. Contestants may only wield one type of pockite. So... Maybe I should keep the green instead of purple? You're here because of tiny power. Just because a purple pockite wielder has never won doesn't mean that it's not good. Oh! Hurry, everyone. It's starting! Hey. No spectators at the announcer pod. Oh. This is Shani Smith. She'll be singing the anthem after the contestant introductions. Hi. Nice to meet you, Tine. It's nice to be met. Now, sit here, and please respect the microphone. Welcome to the Sparkle Cove Tournament! Over the next few days, five contestants will compete to see who'll replace our wonderful Protector Tarak. In each event, the competitor who finishes first gets the most points. Woo-hoo! The last finisher gets the least points. Wah-wah. Whoever has the most points will be Protector of Sparkle Cove. Now it's time to meet the competitors. I am Rahim. I was born deaf, and with my red communication pockite, I can understand and communicate in any language, with any creature. I'll speak to these animals in their languages and give them instructions to complete a task. Translate, Bird, Squirrel and Porcupine! Well done, Rahim. Uh, hi. Lou. Orange pockite. Animal transformation. Go tiger! Go, king crab! Go, griffin! I'm Jake. I have blue pockite, so protecting's my thing. Go shields! Go shields! I'm Gilda, daughter of Protector Tarak. I plan to make my dad proud and become the next protector. With my gold pockite, I can freeze and reverse time. Time power, freeze. Time power, rewind. And now… Polly! There's Polly! There she is! Um… I'm Polly Pocket. I, uh, have purple pockite. Um… Yeah. Tiny power! Whoa! Polly! Huh? Go big! - Ew. - Oh. You got a little something… all over you. Polly looked really embarrassed. I'd better go check on her. The pod lowers for no one until the announcing's done. Plus, you need to sing the anthem. Well, that was… something. Give it up for our competitors! Mm-hmm. Ah. There you go. All better. I don't know if I'll ever be "all better." It wasn't that bad. No one's going to remember once the competition starts anyway. I've done more embarrassing things for sure. Yeah, don't sweat it. Thanks, but easy for you all to say. You were amazing out there. Well, I'd better, uh, go warm up. Can I help? Are you thirsty? Us seahorses know the importance of hydration. No, I'm just… freaking out! How is tiny power supposed to compete against time power or the ability to transform into a shark or the ability to talk to a shark or... Competitors, it's time to take your places at the beach starting line! Polly, the tales of your pockite heroics are known even in Sparkle Cove. So, as they say in your world, you got this, girl. Before we begin, the Sparkle Cove Anthem will be sung by... What was your name again? - Shani Smith. - Shani Smith! I don't have a mic. Well, mine is the best. It broadcasts across the island, you know. I suppose I can hold it for you while you sing. Whoo! Go Shani! ♪ Sparkle Cove ♪ ♪ Pockite's home ♪ That anthem is not so anthem-y. The shorter the anthem, the quicker we get back to me. Maybe I could help write a better song for the closing ceremony. Now, it's time for the first round. The Protector must be able to quickly locate the pockite they need for any job. Competitors, in front of you, you will find a treasure chest full of pockite. Your task is to locate ten pockite gems of your signature color. Fastest receives the most points. You've got this. But I don't. The rules state I must cheer for you from the sidelines. Best of luck! The Sparkle Cove Tournament is on! Contestants, open your treasure chests. Wow! Gilda with the gold! Already? Eep! Tiny power! The Protector must use ingenuity to overcome any obstacle. Time power, freeze! Hmm. Ah-huh! I bet that palm tree would make a great ramp! Tiny power! Thanks. Go shield! Translate to whale! The old "look over there" trick works in every language! Uh, go blue bird! The Protector may need to quickly transport a load of pockite. Tiny power! Tiny power, wagon and pockite! Thanks, Polly. What does she think she's doing, helping the competition? Time power, freeze! Whoa! My shoes! My wagon! My mouth full of sand... yuck. - Oh! Bad form! - Foul! Where's the umpire? - Foul! Off-side! - Penalty! The Protector must use their defensive skills to protect the pockite and Sparkle Cove. Hmm. I'm getting the feeling that being Protector isn't much fun. Sounds like way too much work. And it's ten years as Protector? If Polly wins, will we even get to see her for the holidays? Don't let those bubbles touch you or the pockite. Go shields! Time power, freeze! Tiny power! Huh! Argh! Oh, no! Polly's the first one hit and the first one out. Are you copying me? Great minds think alike. And at the end of the first day, Gilda tops the leaderboard! And Polly's last. But it isn't over yet. Ah! My pounding heart wishes it were. Join us tomorrow to see who will be named Sparkle Cove Protector! Today was harder than helping a bear with his dental hygiene. You did your best and there's still a chance you could win tomorrow. Oh! I know what'll cheer you up... Checking out the library for more info on Prudence. Yeah! Can we, Plum? Hmm. Well, you really should be resting up for tomorrow's events, but it's not against the rules. This way. Have fun! I need to see if the copy of Seabiscuits and More has been returned to the… Prudence, where are... Found her! Here's a book about past pockite holders. - That was fast. - Research is kinda my thing. Ooh, Sparkle Cove History. This could help me with song lyrics for the anthem. "Prudence Pocket adventured through the worlds and collected pockite of every color." Wow. Wonder if she's in any of these other books. - Polly! - Agh! - Whoa! - Go shields! Sorry I startled you. Whatcha doing here? Besides trying to scare me. I was looking up Prudence Pocket. She was the first one in my family to discover pockite, many generations ago. She's my hero. Wow. Impressive. Right? I just wish she would have passed the other colors of pockite down. It'd be amazing to have all the powers. Why are you here? Looking up the Golden Geyser. Well, I figure, if I'm Protector, I need to know about this stuff, right? Oh. Here. A long time ago, a geyser of liquid golden pockite erupted, and because it was time pockite, it paused itself in time to create the golden geyser. It's hard as a rock, frozen in the moment it exploded. The whole island is built on it. Oh. Then all the other colors of pockite started growing on the island. Including that amazing tiny power purple pockite. You really think it's amazing? I bet tiny power leads to really big adventures. If I become Protector, I want to go on adventures and use pockite to help animals and the environment. Wow. You'd make a great Protector. Uh, I think I'm too far behind to win, but maybe I can help you. Look, don't give up already. You're pretty smart. Which is why I'm not opposed to working together. Ah, the inner peace you get after a research sesh, am I right? Oh. I'm sorry, Gilda, I'm just a little busy right now. But I got three first places. If I win, we can stay here. Were you even watching? Gilda, let's talk later. Yikes, we'd better go. Were you spying on me? No. No, of course not. We were just coming from the library, and... It doesn't matter. After tomorrow, I'll be Protector and you'll be gone. Funny thing is, I expected the competition to be a bit more challenging. But you're too busy gabbing with your friends instead of focusing on winning. Well, while you three are having your little pre-losing party, I have work to do. Good night. You're going to do great, Polly. This area is for contestants only. But don't worry. You'll have plenty of time to hang out with your friend after you lose. Sorry, rules are rules. - I'll see you after, Shani. - Good luck, Polly. Hello, competitors, spectators, and fans in this dimension and beyond! Go, Polly! Are you ready for the final competition? This is the real deal, the proof of a Protector's mettle... A tropical jungle rescue! - Wow. - Whoa. Your mission: find these baby monkeys who will be hidden somewhere on the other side of that mountain. Please note the monkeys will be hologram monkeys and no real monkeys will be put in danger. Now, teleport to your places, you holographic rascals! Competitors, the faster you rescue your monkey, the more points you'll receive! So on your marks, get set, go! Go monkey! Hmm… I need a bird's eye view. Translate eagle! Whoo-hoo! The monkeys are hiding somewhere on the other side of that mountain. But my shield's not going to get me there faster. Actually, I think maybe it can. Ready to work together? Tiny power! Okay, get ready. As soon as I untie this vine. Three, two, one. Go shield! Whoo! Yeah! Amazing! Combining powers to slingshot themselves to the mountain? Oh, that's terrifyingly awesome! Go big! Yeah! Yes! That was awesome, Polly. The best view to find the monkeys will be from the top. We can hike up that way! - Whoa! - What is that? An avalanche going backwards? - Is Gilda doing that? - Go shields! Over here! Whew! I think that was it. Whoa! Hang tight, Jake! You have to go without me, Polly! Not on my watch. Or rather, locket. Tiny power! Oh, there's no use. We're doomed! Look down. Trust me. Oh. Told you. Hmm. Ready to catch our flight? Our what? Wow! Whoo-hoo! Now where are those monkeys? Listen. Do you hear that? - Down there. - I've got an idea. But we'll need blue pockite power. Go shield! I never thought of hang gliding while tiny. I never really thought of doing anything while tiny. Polly and Jake to the rescue! Go big! You go first. You deserve it for not letting me plummet off to my doom. What are friends for? In the final round, Polly comes in first, giving her 500 points. Jake is in second with 400 points. Lou is in third, Rahim fourth, and in a surprising upset, Gilda is last. Sometimes shortcuts are filled with mud and end up taking a lot longer than expected. It could happen to anyone! That means it's... It's a five-way tie! Way to steal my thunder during the biggest announcement of my career. Like Shani Smith said, it's a five-way tie! - No way. - No, no, no! Uh, perhaps if you hadn't taken the time to send that reverse avalanche. Nothing, nothing. For the first time in tournament history, we have a tie at the end of... Well, what was supposed to be the final round. If they hadn't cheated by working together, there's no way they could've finished first. There's no rule against cooperating. Nobody's ever tried before. Tomorrow we'll be hosting a tie-breaking scavenger hunt to decide our new Sparkle Cove Protector! What a rush. Good luck, everyone. - Good luck. - Thanks, Polly. That includes you. Good luck. Luck? Don't need it. I've lived here for ten years. No scavenger hunt can stump me. Ah, ignore her. You and Jake were onto something. I bet there are lots of ways to make pockites work together. Dad. Can you believe it's a tie? Dad? - Hmm. - Sorry, sweetheart. Oh. I wonder if Tarak's excited to finish his term. He's always so busy protecting everyone. Now he'll get to relax, go home, spend time with Gilda, watch some movies, see his friends again. Wait. The Protector doesn't get to hang out with their friends? Plum, I need to see Polly. Ah, I can't let you go into the competitors-only area. Not even if the round is over. Now, enjoy the Sparkle Cove hospitality at tonight's Ball. But first, you'll have a chance to create your own ensemble in our very own Fashion Den! Fashion Den? Welcome, welcome, to the most style-tastic place in Sparkle Cove. Whatever you want, the treasure chest has it. But do hurry. Only one hour to pick out what to wear for the ball. Oh, we Cuddlies best go prepare. Do I have to go with you? Please let her stay, Plum? I need Shani's eye for style. All right. Shani may stay. Bye. - Bye. See you. - See you, later. Huh? Cobalt said we could find anything in here, but it's empty. Maybe it works with pockite power. Try asking it for what you want. Go royal robes. Bright green. Whoa. Wow. If this comes with being Protector, you have to win, Polly! Um, no offense, everyone else. Go bedazzled rainbow onesie? Before my father became Protector, we were Earth dwellers. But Earth has nothing on Sparkle Cove. Daddy! Over here! Gilda! Protector Tarak, there is a matter in one of the pockite gardens that needs your attention. Sorry, sweetheart. Duty calls. Oh, it is unfortunate your father couldn't join us. The Protector can't stop protecting just because there's some frivolous ball happening. The party has arrived! I love your outfit! Look at them. Fawning over each other. Not me. I keep my eye on the prize. Won't catch me letting my guard down. Where'd you go? Nugget! Remember what your grandma said: When to your strength you are true, this tourney will be a success no matter how you do. Thanks. Shani Smith! Ugh. Don't tell me. Hugging your best friend is against the rules? No. It's just the announcer booth felt a bit empty yesterday, and since this is an unprecedented round, I'll make an unprecedented request. Will you be my co-announcer? Welcome to the tie-breaker! It's me, your handsome host, Tine, and today, I have with me the incomparable Shani Smith! Hello, hola, jambo and bonjour! Jelly! The next time Shani is asked to go to a magical island to sing the anthem, we're making it a duet and I'm going too. This all-new round is a scavenger hunt across Sparkle Cove. Each competitor will start in a different place on the island. I'll teleport you to your starting position with the ultra-rare teleporting green pockite compass. Ah. Today, Cuddlies will join the contestants to ensure that the rules are followed, but they are forbidden from interfering. Five heart gems of each color have been hidden across the island. The competitors must find as many hearts of their unique color as they can and make it to the finish line before time runs out. If no one finds all five hearts in the allotted time, the competitor who brings the most heart gems to the finish line the fastest wins. Each contestant has a treasure chest with five pearls. Inside the pearls are your scavenger hunt clues plus useful tools to help you along the way. Dissolve the pearl in water to reveal what's inside. Get ready, get set… Let's do this! "The trained eye sees what others miss, fly for three and start to hiss." I know. Tiny power! One, two, three. Start to hiss… Here. Yes! Go big! - Whoo-hoo! High fin! - Whoo! My first heart! Go bird! Strange. The live feed of our contestants has cut out. We can't see or hear a thing. But thankfully, the feed from the announcer pod is still on. Has that ever happened before? Nope, it's our year for firsts. Now, go to Polly Pocket. Four hearts down, one left to find. "Brace the current and meet the cave. Your last challenge stings, so time to be brave." Uh, I'm not sure brave is in my wheelhouse. Uh, maybe we should just head to the finish line with four gems and hope that no one else finds all five? Not a chance, Plum. I just need to ride this river to the cave. A boat would've been a lot more helpful than rope for that. Wait. Gotcha, Pocket. Go time freeze. Where'd she go? How does she keep getting away from me so fast? Maybe we should get back to our scavenger hunt and just let her get to the cave. Yes, Nugget. The cave! Uh, Polly, any ideas? Yup. Hang on! To what? "Your last challenge stings..." Stinging jellyfish! And they're playing tag. Not me, not it! Polly! Tiny power, scroll! Well, done, Polly! I was sure I was going to have to interfere to save you. Aw. You'd do that for me? Yeah, I'd rather not. You'd get disqualified. Good point. Now, eyes peeled. My last heart has to be in here somewhere. Hmm. Do you think it's through all these jellies? Right, the rules. Don't answer that. I'm sure our cameras with footage of the competitors will be back up any minute. In the meantime, um... In the meantime, Tine, I'd love to ask you some questions. You see, I've been working on a new anthem, and who better to tell me all about what makes Sparkle Cove so special. I do like that being pocket-sized lessens the chances of getting stung, but I don't like the way the tentacles wave all wiggly-jiggly. I think if we time it right... Where is she? This is the only place that river leads. Maybe you should concentrate on getting your fifth heart instead of sabotaging. This is my life we're talking about, Nugget. I've got Rahim, Jake and Lou's hearts without a problem. Who knew purple pockite would be such a pain? Time power, freeze. Hmm. Come on, Nugget. We've got work to do. Gilda stole everyone else's hearts. We have to stop her. Maybe we could do anything else instead? I've been hoarding every shard of pockite I could get my hands on to ensure that I'd win. And it wasn't easy to swipe my father's green pockite pocket watch. But I only have four hearts and no idea what this last clue means, so sabotage is the only option! The wisest course of action would be to get this information to the proper authorities and definitely not go storming in there. Go big. Like that. What gives, Gilda? This is cheating. Actually, Polly, it's called winning. That's all that matters. Go on back to your cozy little life with all your perfect little friends and leave the protecting to people who really want it. Do you really want to start your reign as the Protector like this? The Protector must be ruthless. I've seen what my dad has to do, how hard he works. Being the Protector has been his life. Soon it will be mine, and we can continue here in our home of Sparkle Cove. It is my destiny! There are other ways. You don't understand. I have to win. Go to tunnel outside. Wait! Go transmutation solid stone! White pockite? She can change the form of objects. How many kinds of pockite are there? Three hundred and twenty-eight. The top five colors compete in the tournament but there are many others, including several that Gilda has stolen which can be seen on that table. Oh, was that a rhetorical question? Don't worry. I'll come back for you later. No hard feelings. Bye. There's gotta be a way out. If only I had my green pockite. Um, it is unfortunate that having it was against the rules. Is there any in Gilda's stash? Great idea, Plum. Oh, no. I didn't mean to help. Time pockite! Maybe we can use it to get out of here. Go… back in time? Go timey-wimey reverso-magic? Plum? Do you know how do use it? Mmm. Mmm-mmm. You are serious about the rules. Red. Communication won't help us. There's only one person I can think of who might know enough about pockite. I wish I could talk to Prudence. Oh, yes, your great-great-great-great- great-great grandmother. Did you learn anything more about her in the library? Only that she discovered all sorts of pockite. That's all the history books have on me? Well, I'm slightly offended. - Prudence? - Oh. Ah-huh. Gold and red pockite. You figured out how to communicate through time. I-I did? Plum, is this really happening? Great googly goodness gracious! It sure seems real. You'd better start asking whatever you wanted to ask. Given the amount of pockite there, I'm guessing you have about 60 seconds left. What? But there's so much I want to ask you. Like, where did you go after you left Littleton? I used the pockite to explore many of the magical worlds out there, discovered a lot more pockite, and met fabulous creatures along the way. Next question? If you found so much pockite, why did you only pass on purple to our family? Only purple? Oh, kiddo. Shrinking pockite was what let me go on the biggest adventures. But if you put all the colors of the pockite into the locket, then I'd have a whole pockite rainbow which would lead to way bigger, better adventures. Pockite is for sharing. No one should hoard it like this. Pockite came from Sparkle Cove and was spread throughout the dimensions. But there's only so much of it and no one should keep more than they need. When we share pockite, we share power. And that's always a good thing. Now, I must go. This pockite is fading, plus I have a soufflé in the oven. No! Wait! How do I get out of here? Tiny power always got me out of any pickle, jam, or jelly I got into. My friends need their heart gems, and I'm going to make sure they get them. Tiny power, hearts! But how will we escape? - Shh. - We don't... That sounds like a draft. There must be a crack in the wall behind the desk. Ha! Tiny power, desk. Jellyfish! Tiny power! So on my second birthday, I had rainbow sprinkle cake. A Sparkle Cove tradition. That's more than enough to inspire my lyrics. But I am getting a little worried about Polly. I'm worried about all of them. Only a few minutes left and not a single competitor has made it to the finish line. And with our cameras down, who knows where they are? Thank goodness that ordeal is over. My claustrophobia could not handle another second stuck in there. Go big! Agh! Stinging jellyfish! Back into the small, sealed-off room, quick! Please don't sting us. You might not know this, but you just saved us. So you stinging us would be really ironic. Your glow led us out. What a useful kind-of-see-through body you have. You mean we should go that way? Thank you. You are the most helpful jellyfish I've ever met. Polly! - You're here. - Thank goodness. Are you okay? Hardly. I had four hearts, but they vanished. Have I got good news for you! Go big! You found them! Polly, you are incredible! Gilda had them stashed in a secret cavern. Since our clues led us here, all of our final hearts must be in this cave somewhere. Maybe one of us can still win this thing. We have to get to the finish line before time's up or Gilda will win by default. It's okay. Hey there, Jelly. Um, can you speak Jellyfish, Polly? She understands me… …but I can't understand her. Hmm. The flashing and buzzing. It must be a type of language. Translate Jellyfish! She says thank you for the compliments. She wants to help us. You're welcome. Do you know where we can find hearts like these? She says to follow her. This way. - Wow! - Would you look at that! You should take yours, Polly, and go to the finish line. You got us all here. Yes. Clearly, you two don't know Polly Pocket. We got here together. We'll finish this together. Okay? - All right. - Okay. Time is almost up and not a single competitor in sight! Look! It's Gilda! She's coming up to the finish line. Hello! It's me. Four hearts here. I win! Who's the next protector? I'm the next Protector! Woop-woop! Gilda has made it to the finish line. However, she only seems to have four of her golden hearts. Yes, Tine, but I know for a fact that no one else will make it before time runs out. How do you know that for a fact? Irrelevant! Name me protector. Now! Not yet. There's still a chance for one of the other contestants to finish with all five hearts. And it may be unprofessional for an announcer to admit this, but I hope they do! How dare you! When I'm Protector, you're going to be banned from my island... Tiny power comin' at you! We have our first visuals of the other competitors. And it appears they've all been working together. Whoo-hoo! No! Go to golden geyser! I've got to win. What was frozen in time by golden pockite can be unfrozen. Time power, unfreeze! - What's happening? - Forecast didn't call for pockite showers. I think Gilda un-froze the geyser. Go shield! - Not cool, not cool. - I can't look! Eyes open, bro. Eyes open. Gilda can't become protector. Polly, can you get to the finish line? Here. Tiny Power! Time to fly. Give me a throw? Whoo-hoo! Polly Pocket! I don't believe it! No one has ever attempted to release Sparkle Cove's geyser from its time freeze! Gilda put them in danger! Look out! I don't care what the rules say... Incoming! This is not okay. Ah! Heads up! Gilda, what have you done? You've got this, Polly. Time power, freeze. Oh, dear. I do believe Gilda is trying to time freeze you. - Time power, freeze. - You'd better... Plum! Hurry! Polly, help! Oh, I'm speechless. I truly have never seen anyone so underhanded in this whole entire competition. I can make a bubble to protect us, but not elephant-sized. Oh, right. You two, off. Go mouse! Go shield! The gold pockite is weakening my shield. I can't hold it much longer. Oh, no! I've gotta help them. Time power, freeze! No! I must have used too much pockite power unfreezing the geyser. Do not quit on me now, pockite! Time power, freeze! Whoa! Winning can wait. Hang on, gang! I'm coming for you! Tiny power, pockite! Tiny power, pockite! Tiny power, pockite! Tiny power, pockite! - Oh, my. Polly, look out! - Whoa! Marvelous, Polly. But dear me, the others are completely buried. I don't know if Jake's shields can withstand so many direct hits. Yeah. Tiny power, pockite. Go big! - Whoo-hoo! - You did it! Go human! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! It won't be easy to get past the fallen geyser, but if we hurry, we can still finish together! Let's go! - Whoa, dude. Whoa! - What is happening? It feels like an earthquake! Earthquake? A long time ago, a geyser of liquid golden pockite erupted, and because it was time pockite, it paused itself in time to create the golden geyser. It's hard as a rock, frozen in the moment it exploded. The whole island is built on it. Gilda didn't just unfreeze the part of the geyser above the island. She unfroze the part underneath that the island is built on. I'm afraid Polly's analysis is correct. Oh, this is quite dire. Oh, my glitter! - Ah! That looked dangerous! - What happened? - Where's Polly? - Try turning it off and then on again. There's no off button! Maybe a good ker-pow kick? Ker-pow! - Our island! - What's going on? Everyone needs to get away from the island! Ah! I wanted to protect Sparkle Cove, and instead, I've destroyed it. Gilda, your father! He's trying to put the island back together. Time power, rewind island! Time power, rewind! Agh! Dad! He's running out of pockite power. I have to get to him! Go to... Whoa! Oh, please work. Time power, freeze! Thank you, my jewel. You saved me. This is all my fault. I shouldn't have done any of this. No. But you know the greatest gift of golden pockite? You have a chance to learn from your mistakes and try again. Nugget, get Dad to safety. I have to fix this. No, I am the protector! I have to stay! First, we have to get everyone on the island. Uh, Cuddlies, animals, and people to the boat. Then we can figure out how to put the island back together. Go eagle! I can carry a few. Or you could carry a lot if Polly shrinks them first. Yes! Great idea! This is the biggest catastrophe in Sparkle Cove history! Plum, could you fly Rahim and me up to Shani? Since this isn't part of the competition, I'm very glad to help. Tiny power! Shani! We have a plan! Attention! Please get to the beach, where Polly will shrink you and you'll be flown to the safety of the Narwhal Adventure boat! Translate frog. Translate bird. Translate sloth. Go shields! Tiny power! Tiny power! Tiny power! Tiny power! Go Big! Now, please hop aboard the Lou express that'll take you to the boat. Time power, reverse! Time power, reverse! Tine, Shani, you should go to the boat while we try to figure out how to save Sparkle Cove. Absolutely not! I am sworn to announce the Sparkle Cove Tournament through to the end, come rain or shine, high water or crumbling pockite geyser! I'm not leaving either. We've got an island to save. Shani Smith, it is an absolute honor to serve with you. Everyone is safely on the boat, Polly. Great. Plum, you should get there too, with the rest of the Cuddlies. With all due respect, Sparkle Cove is my home. I must help the island. There has to be a way to use the golden pockite to reverse the damage. I'd like to help! I'm sorry, everyone. This is all my fault. But I want to save Sparkle Cove. I tried to use golden pockite to do it, but I'm not strong enough. You seriously expect us to believe you? After all of this? I understand if you don't trust me. But I love Sparkle Cove. I'll do anything to save it. Okay, Gilda. I believe you really do love Sparkle Cove, and really do want to save it. And I'm not sure you deserve a second chance, but I'm choosing to give you one. You all in? - Yeah! - I'm in! Jump across to us! Agh! Tiny power, Gilda! Whoa! Whoa. That tiny power is… amazing! We can all use the golden pockite from the geyser to reverse time on the island. Gilda failed on her own because the destruction is so widespread, no single pockite wielder is strong enough. But if we work together and all use the gold pockite, we can do it. Precisely, Lou. That's a great idea. Gilda, how do we use the gold pockite? The way to use the gold pockite is an old family secret… …that I'm happy to share to save the island. When you touch the gold pockite, you also have to think of a clock ticking backwards while you say "time power, reverse." On the count of three, Jake, drop the shield. Then, everyone grab onto the pockite boulder. Thanks for sharing, Gilda. Sharing's what pockite is all about. Everyone ready? - Yeah. - Yes. Yeah. Ready, Jake? One, two, three! This is incredible. Our fearsome finalists and one courageous Cuddly are working together to save Sparkle Cove. Uh, Tine? You are aware that you're announcing but no one is watching, right? Yes, but it helps my nerves. Remember to think about the clock ticking backwards. All together now. Time power, reverse! Why is it not working? Uh, I think only this part of the island is reversing. Whoa! Why didn't it work? I don't know. Tine, we have to get down there. Polly. I think pockite power only works as far as your voice can carry. This part of the island reversed because that's all that can hear you. You have to use Tine's microphone so the whole island will hear. My microphone? Well… It is the greatest honor of my announcing career to share my microphone with such heroes. Time power, reverse island! Our competitors have banded together in an attempt to save Sparkle Cove. If this doesn't work, it's sure to be my last time announcing the Sparkle Cove Tournament. Wait, what happened? With that in mind, I'd like to ask a special favor of my co-host. Shani, will you sing your new Sparkle Cove anthem? ♪ Let's go, come along with me ♪ ♪ You never know what you might see ♪ ♪ Adventures all around us ♪ ♪ Hey! Better than I've ever dreamed ♪ ♪ Orange, purple, red and blue ♪ ♪ My power's strong with you ♪ ♪ We shine bright ♪ ♪ Oh, come on! ♪ ♪ Sparkle Cove Tiny world's got ♪ ♪ Big surprises And we're waiting here for you ♪ ♪ Come on Sparkle Cove ♪ And what a twist, folks! The Sparkle Cove contestants have saved the island, which means the tournament is back on with only seconds to spare! Who will cross the finish line and become the new Protector? Let's cross together. We all saved Sparkle Cove! I don't care if it's against the rules or not. I'm actually with you on that one. I'm game! - Brilliant! - Perfect! It's as if they all plan to cross at the same time, including Plum the seahorse, who I am certain is not an official competitor. This is unprecedented tournament behavior! Maybe so, Tine, but sharing a big moment is one hundred percent on-brand Polly behavior. Aren't you coming, Gilda? I ruined everything. You're the real protectors. You're right. We are real protectors. But… We could not have made it right without you. You decided to help us. If you had not taught us how to use golden pockite, we could not have done it. You love Sparkle Cove, Gilda. And in the end, you protected it. We're all real protectors. Go, Polly! Another tie? What are we supposed to do? Have another tie-breaker? Actually, Tine, we decided on something better. We want to share the power. Instead of one Protector, we will all be the Sparkle Cove Council. The responsibilities will be divided among the five of us. Thank you for giving me a second chance. I promise to do my best as part of the council. You were incredible, Polly. And creating a whole new form of government? Wow! Now you have ten years to do everything, but what's up first on the Protector agenda? I love the idea of a council, but I don't really want to be on it. Aw! But you're the one who helped us all work together. And you love pockite. I do! But the reason I love it so much is because it lets me have amazing adventures with my friends and family. Oh. That's our Polly. I'm so proud of her. Being on the Sparkle Cove Council is an honor. But for me, it would mean missing out on adventures with the people I love. I think that makes sense. But who will represent the purple pockite? I have the perfect candidate. I nominate Plum the Seahorse to take my place. He knows everything about Sparkle Cove and pockite. And you can trust him to uphold any rules you make. Shine my shells and flip my fins! I will endeavor to be worthy of the position. I love it! The Sparkle Cove Tournament resulted in the establishment of a shiny new Sparkle Cove Council! What will this mean for the Sparkle Cove Tournament? Will your favorite unicorn be out of a job? Only time will tell in this exciting new chapter of pockite history. I hereby pass on my responsibilities as Protector to the new Sparkle Cove Council. Hooray! Incredible work today, Gilda. Thanks! Can you believe I'm on the council? Of course I can. But what makes me most proud is that you learned from your mistakes and did everything in your power to make it right. - Really? - Yes, my jewel. Oh, Gilda. I'm sorry I've been too busy to see what an amazing young woman you have become. Hmm. How will these new duties work out with so many council members? We will share the responsibilities. Gilda will always be at Sparkle Cove to keep an eye on things. And the rest of us will come to Sparkle Cove whenever we're needed. Enough talking. Our first official Sparkle Cove Council action is to get our party on! I believe it's time to return this. Whoa. You have green pockite? Yeah, but like Prudence told me, pockite is for sharing. Polly's right. Pockite is for sharing. But that's your last piece of green pockite. Yep. But I think the Sparkle Cove Council might need to teleport more than I do. I have everything I need right here. I think it's time for Shani and me to go home. We've got lots of tiny adventures ahead of us. We couldn't have saved Sparkle Cove without you and your incredible, amazing, unstoppable tiny power. Thank you for making sure we all won. And showing us that all of our powers are… powerful. Mmm. I'm glad we're friends, Polly. Thanks for believing in me. I'll miss you. Since I'm just over in Cosmopolitan City, we can have more pockite adventures real soon. It was a pleasure to work with a professional such as yourself, Tine. Shani, it has truly been an honor. Unicorn hug? - Aw. Ooh! - Oops. Watch the horn. Bye! See you soon! See you later everybody! If you'll do the honors once more? Tiny power! As thanks for making me part of the Sparkle Cove Council, I hereby gift you something that previously only Cuddlies have had... Pocket Vision. Wow. Thank you, Plum. Now you will be able to see the pocket worlds all around you. Aw. Good luck, Polly Pocket. Though I doubt you'll need it. - Bye, Plum! - Goodbye! You both totally slayed! Oh. I'm so proud of you two. Polly and Shani, island savers! Shani, your song was incredible! We had so much fun. Well, except for the "island nearly being destroyed while we were on it," part. Prudence was right. Sharing pockite is the best. Red communication pockite for our leading scientist, Shani. Now I can uncover the communication mysteries of the universe. Orange transformation pockite for our multi-talented Lila! - Best souvenir ever! - Thanks, Polly! Mom, you get the golden time pockite. Wonderful! And for Dad... Ta-da-da-da. Let me stop you there, Polly-Pie. I think we can all agree that I'm a bit pockite challenged. You did become a subatomic particle when you used Polly's locket. Grandma? Do you want the blue? I had plenty of pockite adventures back in my own locket-bearer days. Richard and I are enjoying a quieter life now. Polly! Blue! All right, Paxton, blue shield powers for you! But no eating the pockite, okay? 'Kay! Go shield! Time power, freeze cup! Nice one, honey. Now, Pax, take a bite of this delicious spinach. No! Go shield! Mmm, that's good. I'm gonna go have pockite adventures with Shani and Lila in the backyard. Love you. Bye! Translate Peaches. Oh, she says, "Hi. Whatcha doing? What's going on? Oh, was that a squirrel? Hi. Did you hear that? It smells like grass out here. Do you like grass? I love grass. Hi!" Go gorilla! Go cheetah! Go kangaroo! This orange pockite totally boosts my workouts! Love the glam, but that's new. This is the Pocket Vision Plum gave me. It means we're close to a Pocket World entrance. But the door to Sparkle Cove is on the other side of the yard. So that means… It means adventure. All together now... Tiny power! Go shield!
