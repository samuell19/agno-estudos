TEATRIX DIGITAL THEATER TEATRIX PRESENTS a William Shakespeare story OTHELLO Direction and Adaptation GABRIEL CHAME BUENDIA Filmed on March 13th, 2015 in Teatro La Carpinteria Enough! Don't talk anymore, it hurts me a lot Yago To me, who trusted you with my money bag as if it were yours - You knew about this - God's blood! Listen to me Rodrigo - You told me you hated him - Curse me if it's fake Great men from Venice requested to appoint me as his lieutenant I know what I'm worth and I know I don't deserve less but he's dumb, stubborn and proud He eludes their demands and chooses a certain Michael Casio a young man willing to condemn himself for a beautiful woman a mathematician with no practice in military science but... He has given him a position and to me that before his eyes I gave him a thousand proofs he leaves me in shadows Instead that chatterbox will be his lieutenant and I and I'm just about to have it This really is the limit! I'd be your executioner, I'd never follow his orders Calm down, calm down, calm down I serve him to serve me, I say Neither can we all be masters nor can we all faithfully serve them Serving him I serve myself I have neither respect nor obedience for the Moor but I pretend it for my own interest I Am not who I am but, if you're not who you are when you talk to me and say I am I don't understand anything Calm down kid You've woken Desdemona's father up Harass him, yes inflame him with anger and if the Moor lives in a delicious world infect it with flies Make that nigger to discolor, let's go Wake him up slowly Wake him up - Mr. Bravancio - Bravancio - Mr. Bravancio wake up - Oh spoon there goes that - Mr. Bravancio - spoon to the other side in this case Christ Mr. Bravancio Mr. Bravancio wake up and take care of your daughter - Thieves! - Oh what are those terrible noises! What do you want? - Mr. this is Rodrigo, is your daughter at home? - Rodrigo, I warned you to forget about my daughter and now you appeared in madness and drunk to annoy my rest - Are your doors closed? - Why are you asking? Because now, now, now right now an old black ram is mounting your little white sheep Who is the infamous one who speaks one who comes to tell you that your daughter and the Moor are making the beast of twelve legs - Oh! miserable one! - And you? - a Senator. - You are going to pay for this Rodrigo Sir tell me how your beautiful daughter at this late hour of the night has gone to surrender to the rude embraces of a lewd Moor see if she's at home and deliver me to justice if I deceived you One, two, three Ah, a taper! Wake up all of my people! I've dreamed of this misfortune and I'm afraid to think it is real. Light, I say light! Farewell! It's not convenient because of the position I occupy to declare against the Moor the State can't fire him They've entrusted him with the Cyprus war even though I hate him, I must show him affection Farewell my friend! It's true, she's not there with the Moor, you said, Do you think they married? I truly believe it sir Ah, miserable daughter! Fathers! Don't trust the souls of your daughters There is no enchantment that can corrupt innocent girls Oh, well, the Burundanzaa exists Bad I say! I'll reward you for your discomfort. Let's go kid This, the little table... I have yet to command. I don't know how many times I thought of stabbing him here with... with my dagger It's better things didn't happen that way Yes Othello but he said such offensive and insulting words against you Well, you understand me, no? Sir Oh! Excuse me Can I ask you a question? Have you ever been married? Be sure the senator has so much power that he can force you to divorce and even get the law giving him reason and of all What a piece of work the tenor of your anger the services I have rendered to the duke will reduce your protests to silence I assure you, Yago, if I didn't love Desdemone I wouldn't expose my freedom - nor for all the sea treasures - I don't understand sir What lights are those? It's the boat, sir. Don't be afraid - Sir, It's the Moor - Yes, to the thief and you went away Attack Attack him, attack him You Idiot, why did you throw it? Sheath your brilliant swords for the dew will rust them gentlemen you shall command more with years than with your weapons Hateful thief! - Where have you stowed my daughter? Let me go You must have pushed her to take refuge in the blackened bosom. Let me go of a being like you who frightens and disgusts You must have corrupted her with drugs, sure drug addict Druggie face, illegal! Attack him Hold still, everyone! If my own life required me to fight I wouldn't have needed a prompter Good sir if I obey How could I satisfy the Duke who has sent to call me? For important State matters It's true your Excellency the Duke summoned the council The council? Yes. At this time of the night? Yes Take him away! I'm arresting you for practicing forbidden arts if these acts are permitted soon the slaves and pagans will command Come on strongly It's true the Turks are against Cyprus the damned ones, yes now Valiant Othello we need you immediately to fight against our enemy the Turk I haven't seen you sir We also need your advice and support, and I of yours Pardon me Duke it's not my duties that have raised me up, no! But my grief If so so flood-gate and violent That it absorbs and devours other sorrows However, it remains the same but what is the matter? My daughter! my daughter! - Dead? - For me yes She's been seduced and corrupted with spells. Let me go, let me go! Without witchcraft nature's not been foolish or lame of sense it can't be twisted so absurdly! Shit - Ah Bravancio - I hit it here whoever it was who slandered your daughter like that Will suffer the bloody book of law, though even if it were my own son, the accused This is the one to blame This Moor, this fierce nigger Yes this nigger Paraguayan, Bolivian, and Uruguayan. This Peruvian this Peruvian, Peruvian It's totally unfortunate What does Othello says to all this in self-defense? What's he going to say, nothing but that's the way it is Mighty sir It's true that I've taken away this old man's daughter It's true that I've married her my crime has this extension and nothing more I'm rude in my speech yet I will simply refer to the story of my love What drugs, enchanted or powerful magic since those things I'm accused of using to seduce his daughter but please a timid virgin just a sick judgment would act like this against natural laws I affirm that he has acted upon her with concoctions Drinks which arouse desire, I get mad Bravancio So cute, so cute Bravancio To affirm it isn't proving it We need more solid proof - Othello - Proofs Your father loved me He often invited me He questioned me about of the story of my life the siege battles I knew I used to tell him about my life I told him about my misfortunes of how I'd been captured innocent sold to slavery of how I ran away and ended up at the bottom of a thick jungle humid and dark of how one night I saw myself in a clearing surrounded by a tribe of pygmies with strabismus who watched me stealthy between bushes and scrubland I walked through that community escaping completely naked hitting their little skulls with my limbs excited by the storm I saw myself in danger of extinction forced to take a little giraffe that grazed in the field with which I murdered each one of those cross-eyed dwarves watching how their squinted eyes jumped out of their bloody basins Oh shit! Desdemona seemed particularly interested in these stories devouring my speech with a skillful ear I noticed it I found a timely hour and I found the means to tear from the bottom of her heart the plea to tell the whole story of my travels I stole tears from her when I was talking about the painful blows that hurt my youth I watched her shiver like dry leaves that fall in autumn The pink tones in her cheeks as her sweat evaporated as it grazed her skin lighted by his return What a woman gentlemen! She blinded my reason as the morning haze She paid me with a world of sighs, thanked me and said That if a friend of mine ever love her I'd teach her to tell my story and that with this... I could make her fall in love It's a metaphor To this plea I replied that if she loved me for because of my dangers I loved her for her pity This has been my only witchcraft Calm fierce one, calm down Here you will be blinded That's what I witnessed Come! Pretty lady to whom in this noble assembly you owe greater obedience Noble father My obedience is divided I owe you my life, for sure, and my education My life and education have taught me to respect you You are the owner of my obedience as your daughter but here is my husband and with the same obedience that my mother assigned you when preferring you over her father I don't know if you understand I mean, the same thing happened to you in another time it the 70's I guess! I affirm and declare that I owed to Othello How strong he is! My husband Othello I give you with all and her heart what if you didn't already have I'd deny you with all my heart Well, well, well, well Let's take care of the State matters, don't you think? Othello please! The Turks are heading to Cyprus with a large army you should resign yourself and overshadow your fortune - Sir. - Eh. Before adventure I feel a particular fervor. - Oh but I request appropriate provisions up to the rank my wife demands Oh well! You can stay at her father's house, if it suits you I won't allow it Neither do I Neither I Sir, sir I refuse to live with my father I love the Moor and with him I want to live I don't fear for my behavior One thing, one thing Who is the most handsome of them? Who is wearing all gray There are three there, possibly three of them with a tie Who will be him? It's you my love. Let me leave with the If you want leave right now Desdemona You have to leave tonight, excuse me! Oh Sir! Excuse me and virtue declares that your son-in-law can't be any lighter being black To the war! - Honorable Yago. - Yes, yes - Here I give you my Desdemona that your wife serve and take care of her. Take them to Cyprus Yes, sir. Watch her over Moor if you have eyes to see She has deceived her father and she might deceive you, too watch her over Moor! If you have eyes to see She has fooled her fa... Watch her over Moor! My life by her fidelity - Let's go Desdemona. - Yes Time demands Yes, yes I'm going with Othello, I'm going with Othello. With whom I'm going? I'm going with OTHELLO! I love you! Yago! - Yago! - What is it Rodrigo? Yago, what should I do? What should I do? Lay down and get to sleep noble heart I'm going to drown myself immediately Come on Rodrigo! - Please Yago I'm bad - Alright I'm going to drown myself immediately Rodrigo it is enough! God! If you do it I won't be your friend. Come on don't be stupid! Stupid? Stupid is to live when life is a torment and more if death is prescribed Being death our physician Oh Desdemona! Oh please live with that, it will pass over I'm fine, I'm fine Go ahead! Like that! I'm fine, let me go Poor unhappy man they will say I've have known this world four months, seven years if I still don't know anyone who knows how to love himself Look Rodrigo before drowning myself for the love I'd rather become a toucan Don't call her a toucan What are you doing? He has bitten my nipple Sick cannibal I ashamed for being in love as a fool but neither I have the virtue to solve it The virtue Virtue my balls It depends on us to be in one way or another Rodrigo Our body is a garden and our willingness the gardener The reason cools violent impulses carnal appetites, lust without brakes Look Rodrigo what you call love It just looks like a desire to me Don't call it a desire. It's true love, a real one Help me to stand up Come on, come on Grab me strongly Simply carnal desire and abandonment of the will Come on Rodrigo! Be a man! Drown yourself? Rodrigo... Rodrigo I'm your friend and I declare myself bound to your merits with strings of a eternal solidity Rodrigo... Rodrigo... Rodrigo Rodrigo listen to me I admitted money into your bag, yes Come with us to the war Disguise that face with a false beard I repeat, put money in your bag It's impossible for Desdemona to continue in love with the Moor for too long, isn't it? Yes, put money in your bag It has a violent beginning Violent will the ending be Put money in your bag Rodrigo is the call for another younger man when she's satisfied with his body, right? Put money in your bag A boy can do much more than a fragile oath between a wandering barbarian and a Venetian arch-exquisite You will enjoy her Rodrigo so... put money in your bag and no drowning before being hanged for achieving your desire than drowned without enjoying it, let's go then I must faithfully serve my hopes but what is it, darling You don't trust me Rodri? What's up, man! Let's go collect money and join together in revenge The time pause keeps a lot of events that will soon be valid and who's hiding out here The, the time pause I already understood the events that were invalid I'm going there and where are we going to meet tomorrow? At home Rodrigo Yes! At your house - and no drowning - no, no drowning Do I take the clothes of the character I played before? Go ahead, calm down, with time, your time Now... Technology come to me Good night how are you? How it's going, oh, with the play Because at the beginning it's difficult to understand but later, it starts, it starts for the people who don't understand This is no "clown" This is more Shakespeare William Shakespeare Thus I hate the Moor and they say he stole my place in bed I don't know if it's true but those suspicions to me are already a truth Much better, it will be easy to confuse him but how? But how to confuse him. We have to think a lot to confuse someone Oh yes, yes Whispering Othello that Casio is too familiar with his wife. Oh that's it! I conceived it The night and hell will go To the birth of my engender What is sighted at the sea? With such a brave swell between the sky and the ocean I can't see any boat from the foamy shore the waves break and whip the clouds yes! News my friends, the end of war the ferocious storm has struck the Turks in such a way that their plan failed I'm swimming breaststroke Michael Casio already here in Cyprus but Othello's fate worries him because they were separated by the storm Thank you valiant inhabitants of the island for the splendid Othello May the sky protect him from the elements because I lost him in a troubled sea storms, high waves and roaring winds gifted with a sense of beauty He abandons his fatal task and leaves the divine Desdemona defenseless The treasure of the ship is already in land Men in Cyprus on your knees Hello Lady! Hello Cyprus! I don't want to get wet, I don't want to get wet Hello valiant Casio What news are from my Sir? He has not arrived yet my lady, but I know he's alright and that - we'll see him soon - Oh yes but... I'm sorry Don't be afraid lady yes, but I fear My lady I asked you not to fear yes, but I fear What do we do, do we get in? Ah, sure we're getting in Of course, look the beautiful Desdemona talking with no other than Michael Casio, of course How much courtesy, don't they? How much fellowship? With a cloth as thin as this canceled a fly as Michael Casio Clarion call! Is Othello with another sign My dear Othello! My beauty warrior! - Othello - Come here a little more... There he is My wonder is as great as my content to see you here - Oh my soul's joy! - Yes I can't speak enough of this content May heaven increase our love and joy as days go by I invented it like this May that be the greatest dissonance between our hearts Yes, Othello I wish it may - I wish it may - I wish it may Come here! My panties! My panties! How well they tuned, don't they? But I'll be the one who puts that music out of tune Gentlemen of Cyprus the war is over! Ah, the war is over! Gentlemen of Cyprus - The Turks drowned - The Turks drowned - Desdemona - Yes! You'll see how well they take you in Cyprus Yes, I want you to take me My love? Love My love, love? What is it?

It's me I came with the tent because Cyprus is full Waiting for the change at the Peach campsite Come here, you are a man and listen to me carefully! Listen! Desdemona is completely in love with Michael Casio - with Michael Casio? - Yes with Michael Are you sure? - With Casio? impossible! - Impossible! Notice how impetuously she caught on the Moor! Just because of his bragging Tell me Rodrigo always in love with his chitchat? What a pleasure he's going to have by looking at the devil She'll start feeling nauseous, she'll hate the Moor Her own reactions will force her to choose someone else and who better than... Michael Casio Michael Casio is young, handsome honest and good He meets all the conditions that desire and inexperience seeks Oh, Rodrigo She already has her eye on him - How has she an eye on him? She took her eye out and threw it Poor Casio, now he's missing one eye? It's a joke Rodrigo, it's a joke Give me a chance, I'll be right back Ok And... Much better, thank you I can't believe that of such a pure soul! Such a soul of what? So pure You must have confused the "pu" with "who" If she's so pure, she wouldn't marry the Moor You haven't seen how she rubbed Casio's hand That was courtesy No, lust! They got so close with their lips that their breath embraced Bad thoughts Rodrigo when these trusts open the way the act follows, the principal action the carnal outcome... No, no! - Give me a moment, I'll be right back. - Yes Come here! Come here, come here! Listen to me! Tonight Casio will be the guardian He doesn't know you, I'll be close Look for some way to provoke Casio Force him to fight you In the nose, in the chest, or in the leg, wherever That will be enough for me to provoke his dismissal! Ah Rodrigo! Will be free from Casio Without whose removal there will be no hope of success Go!, we'll see each other later I'll do it Yago! - Guide me because I don't see anything! -What thing? Left, left, left Go ahead, go ahead I suspect the lascivious Moor has ridden my mare The idea alone is like a poison that corrodes my guts Beautiful, poor wife I'll make her so jealous that she won't be able to annul reason I will plot against his peace until madness Oh yes, yes dumb! The face of evil never seen until used - Yago - Casio - Let's go to guard - It's one hour left lieutenant The General hasn't said goodbye so soon for his Desdemona's love It looks like they haven't spent the night together yet Ah! she's a delightful and gentle creature I would say Yago, the sum of perfection May happiness be among their sheets - That's right - Lieutenant I have a wine jar that out there there are two Cyprus boys ready to toast black Othello's health - Not tonight good Yago - But you're not going to... - I have a very weak head for wine - But you're not going to leave me drinking alone, are you?

So sorry captain Water I want to break free Montano why you put a stain in your reputation this way, answer Honorable Othello Tonight, I have not said or done anything wrong other than self-defense when we're attacked by the breach Gentlemen, blood begins to dominate me - Yago, who was it? - Yago If by loyalty of companionship you don't stick to the rigor of the truth - You're not a soldier. It's worth going to the "Tornu" I'll have this tongue torn out before I speak bad of Michael Casio I see that your affection and consideration softens the issue to Casio's advantage Casio! Although I appreciate you very much You'll never be my officer again - What happened? - Look! - Even my love has risen up - What happened Nothing my love, nothing someone opened the contest that upsets your sweet sleep and what is your name? - Othello - And who am I? - Desdemona, my wife - No Fabric Casio! You'll serve as an example Oh Casio, you're hurt? Yes and I have no cure, my reputation My reputation! - I have lost my mortal side - Yes I understand I only have the left bestial side left, Yago My reputation! - My reput... - Look... Look Casio, reputation is a useless and deceiving prejudice that's earned without merit and lost for no reason, of Casio! You haven't lost any reputa... well... unless you're able to recover it yourself Shakespeare, come on Casio There are new ways to gain the General's trust again - Beg him and he will be yours. - I'll beg him but despise me for being drunk and reckless Besides Yago - That wine was bad - I think you have my affection, no? But this clearly my friend - Drunk and everything - Then come The general is now the general's wife Come to her frankly and beg her to help you get your job back Beg her to join the ligament that tied you to her husband Look, I'll bet anything that this friendship which is now broken will become stronger than ever That's very good advice, Yago Don't doubt about my sincere friendship I frankly believe in it, indeed... - I invite you a drink - I would love to I would love to, but I can't now because I'm on guard I understand, good night, I'm leaving now, Yago Good night and who's going to say what I do wrong when My advice is sincere and honorable who's going to say I'm evil when and indicate Casio The straight line of his goodness diabolical divinity When the evil one induces to the blackest sin First does it with heavenly grace Like me right now While this fool begs Desdemona I pour a poison in the Moor's ear I'll make his virtue become a vision and with his own kindness I'll weave the infamous net in which together they fall Othello - Yago - The same I continue the hunting but... but not like a prey dog anymore but just like a little bug that howls at the pack Tonight I have beaten up pretty bad I'm waiting for a place at the Peach campsite so without money, but with more judgment I'll go back to Venetian Good bye Yago Poor alone without patients which life has been healed but little by little Rodrigo We act with ingenuity not by witchcraft Ingenuity takes time Is it going badly? Casio gave you a tiny, tiny blow and whoever is here destroyed him, tell me - I don't know, I don't care - How you don't care? Ro - dri oh... Rodrigo! I destroy him because in a moment he came over and I asked him Do you want a pine nut? And he told me go ahead, take a punch! It's dawn, see you later, go ahead Rodrigo The time pause. I'll be back! - Farewell, thank you! - Farewell, good luck! You did a mess! Look Casio, don't worry I'll do what I can to support you You'll be as close friends as you used to be No matter what happens to Michael Casio I will always be your faithful servant madam be sure that if I make a friendship promise I keep it faithfully My lord will have no rest I'll keep you awake until I tame him His bed will be his school His table the confessional His chair a little elephant His desk a room His grandma will be a mantle and so on I say things of the mind I get in here and I step out and that rhymes with? Panther, I don't know... Casio, Desdemona will die before abandoning this cause Oh there he comes! - Well madam, I will leave then - No Stay, stay, why you're leaving like this? Stay and listen what I'm going to say to him - I have to talk to him - For God's sake madam Desdemona - I don't like that at all - What do you mean? Nothing I was babbling alone It wasn't Michael Casio who was just talking to my wife Michael Casio? I don't think he can escape like that and I believe it was him I'd die with that cardboard mesh Oh, I'd die, I'd die. That's cubism Cubism and of Warhol, dance for me It looks fantastic on you Othello, Othello I was just, just talking to someone who suffers from your pain - Who do you mean? - To Michael Casio your Lieutenant... my lord agreed to an immediate reconciliation if he truly doesn't appreciate you and knowingly sinned and unconsciously then... I do not know how to judge the face of the honest - Ask him to come back - Was he here now? -Yes and he left so downhearted, by the way What he has beaten, beaten! What he has beaten, beaten! He went like this Well, well it will happen to you Who left me his grief to share it, ask him to come back - Not now my love - Soon? For you as soon as possible Tonight No, not tonight no - Then tomorrow night - Slow - or Wednesday at noon - NO or Thursday at ahhh I love the iron But don't change the subject Nothing to do with this, what is this? It's Michael Casio your Lieutenant Who so many times sided with you when I censored you You make me harass you - to be sorry? - Lout He can come whenever he wants but this is not a favor if one day I ask you to truly test your love it will be a serious one something to solve and risky to give I won't deny you anything Do as your heart dictates, Othello I will always obey you - Farewell my lord! - Farewell my lady! Ah, the chair, ouch! Farewell divine creature! May my soul be lost if I don't love you and when I no longer love you... Chaos will return Sir, excuse me When you're courting the lady, did Casio knew your love? Yes, from the beginning Why are you asking? Out of curiosity, nothing wrong Yes, and he was our mediator several times Really? Yes, for real Isn't he honest? Honest, sir? - Yes, honest - Not that I know - What do you mean? - Mean, sir? Say sir for God's sake or fear, are you hiding something? Talking to me about the tongue of your own thoughts is to give everything to the worst of all the words Reveal your thoughts Come on sir, and if they were vile and false... Look, maybe I'm wrong about my suspicions, but well It's a disease of my nature to suspect Always the bad, Yago bad, bad, bad for your sake, I shouldn't say what I think What are you implying? Look General In a man or in a woman The good name is the most precious thing, I would say Who steals money from me is trash but... Who takes away my good name He steals from me what he doesn't enrich, but to me it impoverishes me, do you understand me? TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK Sir Be careful with jealousy Is a green-eyed monster who mocks the bread that feeds him Jealousy? Jealousy? To make me jealous, just tell me my wife is beautiful My poor charms don't cause the slightest doubt of her fidelity Since she had eyes and chose me I don't Yago I want to see before I doubt If I doubt you approve and you verify it, you don't need more than a solution Farewell to jealously! Or Farewell to love I'm glad because now I can show you my affection and loyalty with much, but much more frankness, look proof, which is said to be proof, I don't have them yet Keep an eye on your wife Observe her with Casio, be alert I know the character of my country Venetian women show to God the vices they'd hide to their husbands, I mean her conscience doesn't lead her to sin but to keep the secret What are you trying to say? She fooled his father to marry you Othello - Yes, that is true - Then... However, she knew how to dissimulate leaving her father so blind that he thought it was magic I'm sorry sir I humbly apologize for this excess of... of love It's nothing. I'll always be grateful to you, Yago Sir, I see this has bewildered you I'm perfectly well. Thank you, Yago I know my wife perfectly well, thank you NO! I'm completely sure that my wife is honest and she will be for many years and you believe so She is honest Yago Desdemona is honest One Two Three She's honest yes but, however, deviating from the natural law - is not normal - Ah! Ah well, well sir there's something wrong because Notice all those marriages rejected with people from her land, status and race What it seems normal... There you can see a lewd inclination I would say an infectious imbalance Look sir, excuse me Well, wait a second, but I'm afraid I'm afraid when comparing you to your countrymen, well Desdemona can... Regret her decision Very well goodbye! - Your wife will keep an eye on her. - She will do so That's it with strength Oh the little boxes of this hour Look sir I beg you not to be obsessed Keep Casio away a little longer and notice if you wife insists on his return, that will tell us something In the meantime, think I'm exaggerating my suspicions Well because we have time... but please sir Sir Don't blame your wife Don't be afraid for my composure I'm leaving now Why did I get married? You calling them of this estimated creature and not of her appetites Othello You are all bad tanned - It's my fault - What? - My head hurts so much right in the forehead My love of course it hurts you got sunstroke Look my love, don't worry Let me tie this handkerchief and you're done this handkerchief is too small That one is big I'm sorry it's not well - My lady - Yes, Emilia Dinner is served - Shakespeare - Yes, I know him This is the handkerchief my husband told me to rob from Mrs. Desdemona Madam loves it because she said she'd take care of it forever I don't know what my husband want to do with the handkerchief I just know to please his whim Cover soldier... Emilia - My love - How are you doing? What would you give me If I'd give you that handkerchief you asked me to rob from Desdemona Did you steal it from her?
