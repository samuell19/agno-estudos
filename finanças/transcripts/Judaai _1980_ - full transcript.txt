[DOOR CLOSE] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello! Hi, shashi darling. How are you? Hi, Krishna darling. Tell me, how did the night pass? I don't know. I was dreaming all the night. Well, that's why you were not in my dreams. [LAUGHING] Then who else had come? A new girl had came. I don't know her name. She was very beautiful. She had such large eyes, That all my dreams could merge in them. Even then there would be plenty of room left in them. And. And there is a mole at the lower part of her left cheek. It is on the right cheek not on the left one. You falterers! And. She was looking like a fairy. Not a fairy but she was looking like a witch. What is this impertinence? Gauri, I will fix you just now. There is a limit of shamelessness. Gauri, who told you poke your nose in the telephone. I never poked my nose I just listened. Why? Because I waned to. Look Gauri. Stay within your limits. - I don't like this at ll. - I also don't like these things. After hearing her false praises that shameless girl was blabbering. - You come down I will fix you. - What will you do? You will know presently, what's the hurry? You must have heard the name of retired justice Umakant Verma. Gauri listen... This is too much she is threatening each step. This is the most enjoyable moments of my life. - Keep a watch. See that Gauri doesn't pop in. - Yes. Everything is alright. Boss. We are in trouble. Daughter is coming. - Stop her, stop her. - I can't stop her. She's storming in. - What should I do? - I don't know. You will get burnt, boss. There is a limit to everything wouldn't let me talk also. He is not ashamed at all. You are such an elderly person but what's the use? - Did you say something to me? - No... no.. See that tree in front. Doctor has asked it not to smoke cigar. But it is not listening. Stealthily, it will defiantly some 1 or 2 cigars. I am thinking of not interfering at all. What's the use? I keep on blabbering. But no one listen to me. You blind fellow, your pocket is burning. Pocket is burning? What's the point in throwing it away now. This rascal is encouraging me to pursuer this bad habit. Take two puffs boss daughter is far off. And I succumb to his machination. You fool, you are not at all bothered about bosses health. Get away. Get away. Go. I have scolded him. If you say, I will call him and scold him again. - No. What the use of doing this drama in front of me. You smoke cigars to your heart's content. -Start taking sweetened tea from tomorrow. - No... no. You smoke cigar, and upstairs let him bath in the tub. Bath in the tub. Whom are you talking about, is it Shashi? Yes. What happened? Did he slip? No. But he is all set to slip. - What did he do? - He.. - Is it? - Yes. - Good morning, dad. - Good morning Shashi. - Shashi. - Yes. Who is Krishna? Krishna... Krishna... Lord Krishan, daddy. Okay. Ask him if it was Lord Krishna or Lady Krishna. Tell her. Daddy make her understand. I don't like her tying knots in every thing. Krishna is friend. Any objection. Uncle this is the ambiguity of English language. Krishna is a friend. Is this friend a boy or a girl it can't be defined. Right. It is the egg of a buffalo have you any objection. What objection can I have? The day I get the egg of the buffalo, I will prepare an omellete. He is wonderful friend, he is a friend as well as an egg. Introduce him to me some day. - He... - Yes, yes tell me. He... Listen boy! There is no harm in talking to girls. But because of the girl... You are forced to tell a lie to your daddy. ...That girl is not worth meeting. Rest is upto you. But the girl was very pretty. Such big big eyes in which all my dreams will merge. Wow. What an original dialogue. - You complained to daddy... - Uncle. You are calling daddy. I will go. Dha. Pay attention. Pay attention. - Pay attention. - Pay attention. Yes. - Father. - Yes. - Shall I serve food. - Yes. Serve it. Okay children you go now. Today's lesson is over. Greetings teacher... - Greetings. - Greetings teacher... Father. A very interesting incident happened today. - What happened? - While bathing in the bathroom. Shashi Was talking foolishly to a girl on the phone. I told uncle and he was taken to task. You should have seen his face. You shouldn't have done that. Why shouldn't I have done? Am I scared of him? It is not that daughter. Both of them respect us a lot... That does not mean that we should take undue advantage. To save the respect. I had told him. You told or were back biting. I never back bite! Shashi Verma is no alien. We have played and studied together in our childhood. Today if he has become a big doctor, That doesn't mean... That he goes on a wrong track And I remain a silent spectator. I am not saying that. What I mean is that whatever you do, do it within your limits. It is not proper to hurt anybody... What is this father? You are always finding fault with my only. - You want curry. - Yes... Wait, wait please. You are all my friends, you should help me. You are aware that I shall be in great trouble without your help. Uncle will kill me, I will be that. Listen Ramnarayan this is your tyranny. To save you from your uncle why should we lie? Come on come on it is time to go to the class. Hey you go to class everyday my uncle doesn't come everyday. You all know that uncle comes and gives me monthly allowance. I will give you a nice treat at Taj don't expose me please. What is it Narayan? Why are you begging? What to do? It's Saturday today. - Oh! Uncle is coming. - Yes. Oh! God. Look there. Uncle has come look there. Now my welfare is in you hands. Either maintain it or ruin it. Please help me, don't forget. Thank you. Thank you. Ramu, come quick, uncle has come. Take it. C'mon. - Greetings uncle. - May you live long, son. - Every thing is alright? - Yes. How are the studies going on? - How is my Ramnarayan? - He is doing very well. He has no leisure from work these days. What do you say, friends? - Yes.. Three days ago, he performed such a serious operation. People were all praise for him. After all, who's nephew he is? Uncle, you watch... ...one day he'll be such a big doctor. That you'll be the very happy. That is my dream also... but where is my son? - Come with me. I'll take you to your son. And also see the long queue of his patients. Move on, move on... Yes, tell me what is your problem? With your blessings. Doctor, I have stomach problem. - Is it paining? - Yes. Show me your eyes. Your pulse, and eyes are backbiting that you ate... ...half cooked pulse, rotten rice, half backed bread. - Did you eat this food or not? - Yes, I ate. Yes, you ate. When you had stomach problem? Why did you eat such food. That means, your eyes are spoilt. Your eyes are spilt, because your brain is spoilt. For that I have to do the operation of your brain. What? Operation? My... no... To fool your uncle you had called me for acting only. Now, you want to do an operation. And make my wife and children as orphans. I don't want your operation and also your five rupees. You, son of a fool, trying to cheat me! Uncle, uncle, you have blood pressure. I'll not spare you... you... - Uncle... uncle... - I'll not spare you... Hey you, where have you gone? Trying to make a fool of me. I'll see that you become a doctor. I'll also break your limbs. You! Nincompoop. Uncle... Laugh! You are laughing because you don't have an uncle like him. You all don't know how dangerous these uncle's are... Then one day let me become a minister of social reform and then... You'll hear only one slogan thought the nation. Victor will be Ramnarayan! Victor will be Ramnarayan! Victor will be Ramnarayan! Victor will be Ramnarayan! Victor will be Ramnarayan! Victor will be Ramnarayan! Brother, and sisters also. People say that we are facing a lot of difficulties. Unemployment, students agitation leader's defecting to other parties. I do agree these are problems. But... Youth of this nation are facing their biggest... ...And the deadliest problem, that is 'UNCLEISM.' Means... Uncle hood. If we all don't protest fiercely against this "uncleism". The future democratic rule of this country will be in dire straits. Today, I announce the formation of All India uncle Hostile Association. And also It's inauguration. [CLAPS] Come back... come back, come back. Excuse me. Where will I find Dr. Shashi? - Dr. Shashi? - Yes. - He is there. - Over there? - Yes. - Thank you. Okay, you go now. Hi handsome. Hi beautiful.

For the last two days I am not feeling well. - Come I will examine. - Come. Dr. Shashi has become busy in the morning itself. He was good case. Dr, Majumdar offered to examine but this butterfly flatly refused. Really. People say that Dr, Verma's reputation is shady. Don't quote people what do they know? Shashikant Verma is as pure as distilled water. People have already defamed him They are still doing it. Each year, on the auspicious day of "Rakshabandhan" I tie the sacred thread on his wrist that's all. He is a jovial person. - B.P. is slightly low. - It's low. Even after you touched me, It's low. Kiss me and it will be all right. Come, sit here. Reduce your late nights. Take these pills that I am prescribing, morning and evening. And come for check-up again next week. And what shall I do till next week? - Will you meet me next week? - I will ring you up. Hello, Can I talk to Kamala? - Hi handsome. - Hello beautiful.

I should definitely get angry, scold him. - Where is my gun? - Gun is in the house. Use the stick at the moment. Okay, Aye you son of a... Hey shashi. Who is it? Oh God... Daddy. Who were those girls? - Those... Daddy I mean... - I mean that... ...decent boys don�t play kabbadi with girls in a public place. - Daddy I was not playing Kabbadi. - What else? - You know.. - No. I don�t know? It's not like that daddy. Between you and me there is a generation gap. These days it is not considered scandalous. - Oh shut up Shashi. You don't have a generation Then how can there be a generation gap. Your grandfather was illiterate, he was a labourer. I was also a labourer in my childhood. I studies under the lamp post night after night. But I never told my father that between... ...he and me there is a generation gap. There can not be a gap between generation. Time flows like a river. Time is only PRESENT. The one which will call PAST was yesterday. And the one which we call FUTURE Will be PRESENT tomorrow. But if these girls are your PRESENT... ...Then I have no hope for your future. Look shashi. There is no harm in meeting girls. But every friendship and every relationship has a limit. Understood. Go. Was it alright? But I never told you to give such a long lecture. But I can�t give a small lecture. But tell me... - ..Was it alright or not? - Yes, it was alright. - Then can I smoke a cigar now? - No sir. - One puff. - Absolutely no. If ever you ask me to scold, I will not scold, naughty girl. Shall I apply almond oil in your hair. [HUMMING] Wonderful, wonderful,... To tell you the truth you sing beautifully. What a big range you have in you voice, wonderful. It is not a joke to sing for three girls at the same time. You phoned all the three of them and called them. Hey... Not all the three only two of them. - One of them was called by you. - And you only brought daddy. Naturally, will you meet girls in Holiday Inn. Why will I not meet. I will definitely meet. Who are you interfere in my life? What right do you have? I've right. All time I've right. Yes, Right is sold in the shops in the market. So that you can buy it. Go and flatter daddy. Do I flatter uncle? For what? The bunch of keys that is hanging, for that. Yes, yes, As if these keys are very dear to me. Aren't you ashamed to talking like this. Truth is only bitter but not cheap. Listen, I am poor but that does not mean. That the rich man's son has the right a taunt a poor person. Here, take your house keys! And even you beg me also I will not come back. Go... go, don't intimidate me by you threats. If you go away, will the world perish and annihilate. I am going. What does he think of himself? He thinks that I can't live without him. What is the matter daughter? Father, is it a matter of shame to be poor. It's not a matter of shame for a man to be poor. It's matter of shame for this society. Which makes some people rich and makes the rest of them poor. Then, why does Shashi's taunts me? Do I take any pay to manage the house of uncle. Let Shashilkant Verma Manage his daddy's house. Dubey... Oh! It's 7:30, and a coffee hasn't been brought yet. Can't you people hear? I am shouting for the last one hour. Where is the coffee? Daughter hasn't come yet. Will I not get coffee? If she doesn't come? - We don't have the keys. - Here are the keys. - Petrol has also to be filled, sir. - Fill up the tanks of all the cars. - What is to be cooked today, sir? - My head. What can we do brother daughter lays down the menu. And she hasn't come yet. Will food not be cooked in the house if she doesn't come. Hey you, you will take pay from us and... ...You will ask the menu from her, who is she? What an irony? It's my house and she will run it. Idiot. What do you think? I can't run the house? I will show how to run the house. Go to the market and buy chicken, partridges, etc... go. Finished. You are still here daughter. I told you, I will not go there. Alright don't go. I will start drinking sweetened tea form today. Mr. Narayan, get me one more cigar. I didn't come for one day and you have discarded the regimen. - I will do anything who are you to stop me? - I... Tell me, tell me. Why have you kept quiet. You saw Narayan... She has quarreled with Shashi And she is showing her temper on me. Forget your anger daughter and come with me. No, I will not come with you. How dare Sahshi told me. That for the sake of bunch of keys, I flatter you. Really, who is that son of a gun to talk like that. Is it his father's house? It is my house, it is your house. That is alright Umakarnt. But Why are you abusing yourself? You keep quiet friend, I am talking to my daughter. - Go ahead. Look daughter, Shashi is not that bad. His mother died when he was child. I got absorbed in my work, that's why I couldn't mother him Properly. But remember one thing. Till I am alive, you will not leave me and go. No uncle, don't talk like this. Listen, If you are late even by 1 minute... All the chickens will be oil and car tanks will be filled up. I won't be late. What does she think of herself can't I live without her. She doesn't know how to keep clothes in the cubboard. Now, I don't know where she has kept my tie. You want the tie, move. Move. Move I Said. [FOOTSTEP] Take it. Thanks... Thanks a lot. If everything is kept at the proper place, I can also find it. I haven't scattered the clothes all around the room. But people should know that which thing is to be kept where. - I don't know all these. - If you don't know learn it. - Why should I run? - Don't learn. Search for tea in the fridge and cold water in the bathroom. Put on the tie. Oh. You are grown up. But, you don't know how to knot the tie. You saw the repercution running the house. It was a smooth job. Except that I didn't get tea and the tie at the proper time. And then... Oh! It�s late, I will go. - Good morning, sit down. - Thank you. - There is a good news for you. - What is it, sir? WHO is orgaising a seminar on heart diseases in Geneva. You have been selected as a delegate for it. It is a ten days seminar and five week's tour. - Totally it will be six week's trip. - Thank you very much sir. Thank your talent. All the best my boy. - Congratulations... - Hello Shashi. Congratulations With your blessings. I have heard that you are going to Geneva. Geneva! Hey, don't go on your trip, come back. Yes... laugh, laugh to your heart's content. But tomorrow when I became a special minister. Free wheeling minister then there will be foreign trips. Foreign lands, foreign sky, foreign girls. [LAUGHS] [FOREIGN LANGUAGE] - Isn't she beautiful. - Yeah she is beautiful. [SHOUTS] Hey! Come back, come back. Hey Dubey, hurry up put the luggage in the car. See that nothing is left behind. Sir, with me around how can anything be left behind. C'mon. Ramachander come. Come, Narayan, come. - Have you come to complain? - No, to make you understand. You have a son, and he is going out for few days. I am the father of a daughter. That means, I should die. You have grown old. Like old people learn to bear separation also. Yes... yes. [SIGHS] Dad.. Daddy, what is this? Old people have the own ways to feel happy. Come, it is flight time. But why are you coming to the airport unnecessarily. To return alone. Where is Gauri? Gauri... gauri. What are you doing sitting here alone? I am definitely not sitting. I am standing. Hey, why are you so worried? I am not going for ever it is a matter of tow weeks. And when you voice will also get some rest. It must have been tired by complaining. - It need rest. I will miss your nose. - Don't act affectedly. I am only worried that you put on. Mismatching tie with the shirt and people will laugh. And while returning, you may get some girl tagged on to you. In stead of Krishna, Radha, Kamla English names will be there. Katherrine, Audrin, Diana, isn't it. Yes, it is possible. - What? Uncle! - Hey, why are you calling daddy? Okay, I promise you I will not make any friends there. - And it you make... - Of oh your impossible. Uncle, why don't you eat something? It'll take something for me to get used to live without Shashi. Had I knew it would so painful I would have never allowed him to go. Excess of affection also, increases the pain of separation. Daughter, What are you thinking? Curry is burnt. Oh no! Gauri... - What are you doing here alone? - Nothing, uncle. I think you must be finding this house lonely without Shashi. Isn�t daughter? Come let's go for a walk, come. [LAUGHING] No.. Please stop it. "This separation from you pines me." "I lost my slumber in your memories." "This separation from you pines me." "I lost my slumber in your memories." "This separation from you pines me." "I lost my slumber in your memories." "There is inhibition of modesty." "There is inhibition of modesty. But I am free from it now." "Now I am defamed in the world." "This separation from you pines me." "I lost my slumber in your memories." "May sorrow never cross your path." "May sorrow never cross your path. Let's unite your hearts today." "We need neither procession nor celebration." "This separation from you pines me." "I lost my slumber in your memories." "Every problem is resolved." "If you had said yes earlier." "We took long to say yes." "This separation from you pines me." "I lost my slumber in your memories." "This separation from you pines me." "A passion is kindled with every twist and turn." Come daughter, let's go home. - Gauri daughter, Gauri daughter Boss has become very ill. - What? He is very restless daughter. - Let's go. - Let's go. What happened, uncle? Uncle, what happened? - Umakant, what is the problem? - There is severe pain in the chest. - Father call the doctor soon. - Wait, I will call the doctor. - Narayan. - Yes. Don't inform Shashi, otherwise he will rush back. Alright. I Umakant Verma Son of late Ushakant Verma. In my full senses... Without any pressure, I am writing the will. When Lord Rama and Janaki sat on the same carpet. Dashratha felt very happy he felt thrilled. [WEDDING MUSIC] Here uncle, take this medicine and sleep comfortably. Take it. Please take it, please it. Take it. Uncle... Why do you cry son? Soul, gets separated but doesn't get killed. Umakant will live in you and your family. Uncle soul doesn't die, but it pains when it is separated. [SIGHS] Greetings Mr. Shashikant. Come Mr. Chandrika Prasad, sit down. What made you to come here? I have brought the will of late Mr. Umakant Verma. Tell me the main features. Rest I will read later. As you wish. Late Mr. Umakant has given Rs. 5000/ - to Ram Auta Dubey. Rs. 5000/- to Chiranji Lal, Rs. 01500/- to gardner. And Rs. 1500/ - to Dhanvir driver. And the rest he has given it, to you. Provided, within on year after his death. You marry Miss Gauri. - [BACKGROUND MUSIC] - And if you don't do this... Then the sole heir to the entire property of Umakant Verma. Will be Miss Gauri Singh. Thank you Mr. Chandrika Prasad, Thank you. Alright, take this I will make a move. Okay. Congratulations on the death of daddy Miss, Gauri Singh. What did you say? I said the same thing that should have been said. Now stop this drama of astonishment. As if you don't know anything. - What is it that I don't know? - There is no need low act any more. You think that to get daddy's property.. I will marry you? Never. To buy a husband with daddy's property... you will have to go to some other market. Get out from here. I could never think that behind the facade of service. You will charm my innocent daddy. To grab his property. Whatever you wanted you have got it. Daddy, had written in the will that if I don't marry you... Then you will be the sole their of his property. You can become the sole heir, because I will not marry you. You have gone mad. No I have not gone mad. In the mirror of this will, I have seen your true self. You have fallen down from my estimation. What ever God had written in my fate, you should have left it at that. Why did you write my fate? You saw the result, isn't it. - Job is done daughter. - Yes, father. Then go and return his Will to him. Here are the papers of your property. Now feel happy the property has been registered on your name. Take charge of your keys. Our family doesn't have the custom of taking back things once given. I don't want this property. In my family we don't have the custom of begging. Then why did you entice daddy to write the Will. Shut up Shashi! How many times I have told you not to abuse me. I didn't even know that uncle had written any Will also. Don't act smart. Look, look. Don't provoke me Shashi. What do you think of yourself? You think you will weave such a big web to get married to you. I don't need your father's money to buy myself a husband. Did you ever think about? That I too have my own wishes likes, dislikes. Dr. Shashikant Verma! I have my own likes and dislikes. I wouldn't give you a chance to refuse... ...before that I refuse to marry you. We are poor. We may not know how to live in a big house. We may not know how to wear good clothes. But, we do know how to live with respect. I tried to grab the property. Whether you harbour this suspicion still or not, it's upto you. I know only this much. My link with this house is snapped for ever. I am your childhood friend. I want you to be happy. But remember once thing, Shashi! But don't live like a play boy. Be one woman's man. Uncle also wanted, this only. Brother, Mr. teacher has come. Teacher has come, why? All this luggage is kept in the cart, He is going. He is going where? - Greeting uncle! - May you live long. - What you want to say? - What's there to say? Till Umakant was alive it was a different matter. - But now we are going. - Where? To the village. I have a small bit of land. I'll do farming and teach children. And I will find some nice boy and get Gauri married. Alright. God bless you. No... No, no this cannot happen. All the luggage has come isn't it. - Yes father! - Sit down, daughter. Let's go. Come on. Stop, stop the cart. Avoid the stone on the way and go cart driver. This cart will not go. - Why will it not go? - Because I am saying. Who are you to stop me? - This, I will tell you afterwards first get down, get down. - No. What is this high-handedness? I, I can't live alone! Gauri! Yes, whatever I said was wrong. But both of us say wrong things to each other. Quarrel amongst us this is our nature. Look, Gauri, now we have changed we must change. Okay, okay. Even you want to go you can go, definitely go. I will tell daddy. That Gauri is not so magnanimous. So as to forgive someone for his small mistakes. Is it a small mistake? You have insulted the affection that was between me & uncle. Is it a small mistake? You have accused me of... Deliberately weaving a web to grab uncle's property. Is it a small mistake? You made me cry even while leaving. I have mad you cry but I'll wipe your tears also. I have put a blame on you.. you put a bigger blame that that on me. But, don't leave me and go. I don't know how to live without you, Gauri. And I... And I will not learn to live without you. - I will die. - No! Gauri... Gauri... Gauri... [CRYING] "This season.." "This season.." "This is the season of love." "This is the season of love."

As I didn't get that phone. That baby is now dead! Did you hear?! You have killed a sick baby. No. You have extinguished the only lamp of a home. You have but a black mark on my profession. Shashi, why are you talking like this? I am also a mother I swear on my son Ravi. Krishna, never informed me that her baby was sick. Don�t swear falsely on my son. That girl did not inform.. Did you allow her to inform? You are living, wearing a bandage of suspicion on your eyes. You are unfit to be a doctor's wife. What did you say? I, I am unfit to be a doctor's wife! And you! Are you fit to be a doctor? Do you think, don�t I know what all happens in the hospital? What? You have fun, with you old girl friends, that's what happens. Shut up! You slapped me! Rustic, manner less, low down person. Guari keep quite otherwise. Otherwise, what will you do? You will kill me. Strangle me, kill me. But I can�t stay her any more, talking your beatings. [CRYING] If you can't stay here then go. I will not beg to stay here. Perhaps you ego will break only after you leave from here. Don't be under the illusion that I will return in a few days. I will never return. Come Munna. Wait. Ravi will not go with you to suffer. Alright keep Ravi. But a child isn't brought up in the lap of wealth. But is brought up in mother's lap. How the child is brought up, I also know. You don�t have to tell me. Alright you are separating this child from me. But what will you do with that one. Who is sitting in my womb... and watching That how mean his father is. Go, go. I will also see. How long can you live without this mean person. Oh! No don't cry. My prince! He has bothered you!

Don�t forget that you are an ex-minister's daughter. But friend. When are you going to become a minister? I have changed my mind. You never know when the mid term poll will be announced. And I may have to spend so much money... that I may not be able to recover. I have changed the line. Her father is ex-minister that's why I know so many people. That's why I have decided to do business. And I have also decided to make you a partner. Yes. And I have thought of another thing. I will make your son my son-in-law. That's why I have instructed my wife. To produce a girl. What�s this impertinence. Shashi, sister-in-law is not to be seen. Where is she? Don�t talk foolishly. Gauri, sister-in-law will be inside. Go and meet her. And leave both of us for some manly conversation. No, RN. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Gauri is not inside. - She is not inside? Then where is she? - Listen R.N. Is it necessary to talk about that thing. Which I don't want to talk about. Guari has left me and gone. She has left you & gone! Why? Because her pride was more... ...dear to her then her home. [KIDS SHOUTING] Excuse me. Can you tell me, where is the master's house. With you blessings. Mr. He has passed away. - Passed away! - Yes. - But, when? - Mr. It's been around a year and a half and two. A year and a half and two, but atleast Guari must be there. - Guari? Mr. she has gone somewhere after selling her Ancestral property. She has gone, but where? God knows where she has gone? [BIRD CHIRPING] - Madam, should I call the master? - No. No... For me, this child of mine is more than enough. My life will pass in brining up this child. I'll educate him, with affection. I�ll make him a brave young man. And, after he grows up... He'll make me forget his father's hard heartedness. Then.. Then while singing a lullaby to his child. I'll one day sleep forever in peace. Come, come come... Catch him, catch him, catch him are he has fallen... Now take the car and speed up. - Hi Umakant. - Hi Ravi. - So, you are coming, isn't it? - No friend. - Sorry. - Why? Now, what is the worry? The exams have got over. Ravi, I am sorry today I�ll have to go to the village. Otherwise, mother will get worried. Alright, as you wish, but friend had you come we would have enjoyed. Friend, some other time. Ok all the best come soon. Bye. Monica, look, your boy-friend is waiting for you. - Hi Ravi. Hi mona. Ravi, I am sorry, were you waiting from a very long time? What to do? This is not a play It's a love. - You naughty. - Come. Hi... Manisha I am sorry, I kept you waiting for a long time. Mr. What to do? This is love not a play. And Mr. moreover today. You are leaving for you village. You are right. - Come, I have plenty to talk to you. - Come. Fill the tank. Ravi, what's the matter? Today you seems to be really pepped up. Today, I have got a leave from the college, from my studies. And what really pep's me is that, I have got you. Now everyday you and me.. It will be fun. It's okay. But for month I'm going to maternal home. What? How much day. For one month, One month, Oh my God. I'm dead. That mean I've to die 30 days in your waiting. [CHUKLES] Mona I... Hi dad! Who was that girl in your car? Girl...? Oh that girl. Just a friend dad. Just a friend. Oh I see. Yes, daddy. Monika. Monika Tiwari. My class friend. Very intelligent girl. She relates the chemistry formulas. Like how a renowned poet would recite his poetry. Look Ravi, flirting with girls in the open is not good. Oh you don't understand. It's generation gap. Generation gap. One day, to get an answer for the very same question. On generation gap. I had talked to my father. And he told me, that there can never be a gap between the generation. How is it.. Because I have seen the happiness of life. ...And the end of that happiness. I am making you understand. Look, there is nothing wrong in mixing with girls. But for every friendship and relationship, there is a limitation. - Do you know what does it mean? - Means... limits. Yes, limits. - When are the results coming? - Day after tomorrow. - What are you expectations this year? - Yes... There are no chances that I get less than a first class. I'll be satisfied, even if you pass in the 3rd class. Come. Mother, mother... Hey, what are you doing? - Mother... - Leave me, have you gone mad? Oh ho. What happened. The thing is instead of kissing my face, you are beating me. Mother, do you know that I have come first, I have come first. - You have come, first? - Yes. - My son has come first. - Yes mother, yes. Son, today you have fulfilled all my dreams. To bring you up, I had no other means other than my courage. Mother. Today, I have been rewarded for my tired days.. And for all those sleepless nights that I had spent. My son, wait, I'll get sweets for you. - Wait. - Mother. So, have you got a first class, tell me? - Daddy, I had written my paper's well. - But, those people failed you. Right? Have you failed for the 2nd time for 3rd time. Well, I don't think, you must be remembering this too. Because by now it must have been a habit. Anyways, tell me, now what are you plans? Daddy, I don't want to study any further. As if, you were studying before. Alright, I'll have to make some arrangements. When you don't know to smoke a cigar. ...Then what�s necessity of smoking it? What did you say? Your father did not know the job of a minister. Didn't he become a minister. I didn't know to marry. Didn�t I marry. You did not know how to conceive a child. Didn't you conceive a son. Oh, I mean a daughter. That's why... ..my dear brother's and sister's. Come back, come back. Hey, Shashi when did you come? Before. You could come back. Uncle, why don't you cure daddy by giving some medicines. He becomes lost in some other world, while sitting itself. Daughter, I had thought after you father would grow up. He would have got a rid of the habit of building castles in the air. Hey, how to get rid of these, because "Old habits dies hard". Oh! Yes, today Ravi's results would have come. Well' Manisha has done wonders. She has broken my records. She has passed in the 2nd division of the very first attempt. With your blessing. And Ravi has broken my record. He never passes at all. I fail to understand what do I do with this boy? What can you do? If he is not interested in studies, stop his education. Put him onto some work. Then I think politics is indeed a better option. Because only this is one profession.. ..where going being educated hardly matters. - Should we put him on with some minister. - No... Think of some permanent job. Alright, we�ll put him on in the factory. You send him tomorrow it self. But, yes I'll definitely grill him in the interview with your blessings. Wow! You do excellent versification. But, Mr. in front of the father, this versification will not hold good. Then madam, give me a few tips. Then you watch how I will play a trick on you father. What will be my reward? Reward, A... on your rosy cheeks. There is no need of an interview with your blessings. Thank you, sir. That he would be interested in working in the research sec or in the production. In the research section. Manisha had recommended a right person with your blessings. - Best of luck you're appointed. - Thank you very much, sir. - Hi, Umakant. - Hi, Ravi. - Hello uncle. - Hello.

Come on, let us show both of you, your departments. - Let's start. - Get up. No, I�ll not go to Delhi. - I'll only stay here. - Mother, don�t tell this. In Delhi I have got a very good job a bungalow, car, servants, etc. I very well know, that no son can repay the debt of this mother. Give me an opportunity to serve you atleast a little. Tell me, why are you quiet? After all what is left in this village? Son, I have stayed there enough. And don�t tell that what is left in this village? In this village all you childhood memories, all your frivolity. All those dreams are present.. Which I had seen for you, as you grow up. Youngster's have future with them. And old people have their past with them. The remembrance's which are good or bad, blurred or clear. Okay, fine, I'll come for your happiness. Okay. Good morning, Ravi. Good morning to you Umakant, congratulations. - Congratulations but for what? - Hey. For our S.G. Iron casting there is a terrific demand created.. In the Indian and foreign market. Look, there are orders worth 7 crores. Good, very good Ravi. Ravi, I congratulate you for this. No, no, no for this success the entire credit goes to you. Not at all. If there was no co-operation from your end, then what could I do? Being happy with this success the company is throwing.. A very big party in your honour. From the time I have left politics. I have forgotten on how to deliver a speech. Because the quota of delivering speeches has got over. That is why, I'll come straight to the point. Ravikant Verma, out company's chief sales manager.

And mother, In reward they gave me a cheque for Rs 10,000/- Thanks to God, that I Got a son like you. Mother. Oh! Yes, How was the party? Party, oh it was great Just great. They was Ravi's daddy danced it was just superb. And that Miss Lilly who had a lot of fame. Mother, After a while she was standing alone and clapping. And he, he kept dancing and dancing. Mother, one should have seen Ravi's face. It looked as there was a different kind of shine on his face. As soon as the dance got over... Ravi, started shouting daddy... daddy and embraced him. Mother, he wanted to embrace him. But Ravi, he did not bother about anybody. He just picked into his arms. Mother, in this world there would be no son who love his father... and no father who would love his son as much as they do. They never got tired addressing each other "My dad" and "my son". How interesting a father could be? If my father was also present here... Then the charm of living life would have increased more. Do you feel my love is insufficient, son? Mother, this is not the point your love is immense. But if I would had got father's love... So it would have been immense too. Hi Umakant. Hi Ravi. What a surprise? Hi. Friend, there was a breakdown of the office car. So I thought I'll myself pick you up. Come, come. Mother.. Mother, mother meet him, he is my friend Ravi. Our Director, Dr. Shashikant Verma's only son. Ravi. God bless you, my son God bless you. Come, sit down, have breakfast. No, no, I am already through with my breakfast.

Eat some more. What happened, what happened? Drink some water. Mother.. Mother, you have never feed me with so much of affection. Yes yes, as though you were grown up reading " Ramayana ".. And was brought up eating with your own hands. Moher, we have got too late. - Let' go. - Okay. - Son. - Yes. Keep coming. - Definitely, mother should I leave? - Okay. - Come. - Mother, see you, I'm leaving. [CAR DOOR CLOSE] [CAR STARTS SOUND] Ravi, why you are not having your dinner? What are you thinking? Daddy, today I had been to Umakant's house. I met his mother. His mother is a wonderful lady, daddy. I see. Yes daddy. And in this house I don't even have a photo of my mother. If I could see the photo, then I could also see her in my dreams. Daddy, where is my mother? I don't know. She must be somewhere plunging into the swamp of her pride. Because of her mistake, one of my patient died. At that time, you were too young. When I scolded her she felt bad. She left me, you and this house of her's. From then till now, neither she remembered you nor me. I fully tried to bridge the gap of a mother.. But probably I couldn't. I don't know where this is your-ill-fate or mine. But, my son, today suddenly how did you remember of your mother. That's because, today I saw a mother. I saw what actually a mother's love is? And I felt that in my life, what have I really missed. - Hello. - Hi Ravi how are you darling. You are really too much. You called me at the Oberoi hotel and you got disappeared. And I'm getting bored over here. Day before yesterday, in the care the desires that you lightened up. I couldn't sleep the whole night. And you know last night how much you troubled me in my dreams. That's it, I can no more wait. Being a girl, aren't you ashamed of talking such cheap stuff. Ravi, you are talking all these. I am Ravi's father's speaking. Oh! My God! A robber can get rid of robbery but cannot get rid of interchanging. My dear, try to understand. I was just seeing that... now a days God's taste has absolutely become bad. He doesn't make beautiful faces at all. The last beautiful face he made was of yours. I am remembering of that morning, when you... Oh! My life has gone. In the last birth where you married to a renowned poet? I don't know, why? Don't know then how did he tell his poetry? Before telling and hearing she agreed. Then she shouted and told I am dead. Anand, don't tell a lie, you never knew this poetry. Two months back, you heard it on the radio. From then, whenever you get a chance you keep reciting it. He's again lost, isn't he? Come back, Come back, Come back. Hey, Shashi you are a friend or an enemy. You always make me come back on delicate situation. Hi uncle. Hello my doll. Actually, I am very much annoyed with you. You are my darling uncle. You can never be annoyed of me. Why not I can definitely be. Do you know, it is been so many days that you have visited our house. By the way your miser dad and mom haven't still asked me.... for a cup of tea. Let's have a cup of hot tea. I'll just bring, I'll go and come back in a moment. That's like a good girl. Sister-in-law, sit down. I want to talk to you about something. Talking with him is totally useless. He immediately enters into the world of imaginations. I have started liking Manisha a lot. That's why I wished that. I... Wrong, absolutely wrong. Mr. Who are you as a person to make a wish. We are the brides parent's with you blessings. Why darling? The right of making a wish is our job. Shashi, I have, I mean you sister-in-law, I mean both of us. Have decided that our daughter's marriage... Should be done with your son. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] No, wrong. Your daughter's marriage cannot be done with my son. My son's marriage will be done with your daughter. I will not get married to Manisha. Why won�t you? I love a girl, and I have promised to marry her. Even, I have made a promise to Ramnarayan. Our friendship is too old. And to convert that friendship into a relationship... We had already decided years back. If your marriage takes place it will be only with Manisha. And that is final. [PASSING CAR SOUND] [DOOR BELL] Come in. Hi Umakant darling. Manisha, you here? Come sit down. What happened is every thing alright? If everything was alright, then had I driven so fast and come here. Daddy and Shashi uncle have fixed my marriage with Ravi. I came to know that you were here that's why I came here. Now, what will happen? What did you told your daddy? Hey, I must have told something isn't it. I didn't say that I am going out of station. They only know that I am in one of my friend's birthday party. That I'll come tomorrow. What's this, there is such a big crisis in my life... and you are laughing? There is no crisis in your life. What do you mean? That there is no crisis in my life. Then should I quietly get married to Ravi? Tell me one thing... why do girls have their mind in their make up kit. Listen darling, Ravi is my friend. When I'll tell him. That I am in love with you, then he'll rightly refuse. Darling, don't worry. Everything is going to be absolutely alright. Okay, smile. Friends, we got married but didn't felt the excitement. Daddy will not give us his blessings come on lets go to mother. Mother? Yes, Umakant's mother meaning my mother it is one and the same. Hey, if you see her your day will be made, come. - Okay, see you. - Bye! [CHANTING] Mother! Come. Mother, she is your daughter-in-law. I have come here straight after getting married. Give us your blessings. God bless you. May God keep you both happy forever. But son. Daddy must be very angry, that's why I didn't go there. He wanted me to get married somewhere else. That's why I thought of finishing the marriage. And the truth is.. That I didn't have the courage to go in front of him. If I had a mother like you, you could have made him understand. Don�t worry my son, everything will get alright. Just wait. Saw my mother's affection? Hello... Manohar? Is Ravi at your place? No, no I just had some work with him. I don't know, as to where he has gone? Alright, I'll see to it. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. Dr. Verma here. I am.. Gauri speaking. Who Gauri? Me, Gauri. Gauri. Gauri. Is it you? Yes it's me. Gauri, how are you? I am fine. I am fine. I want to talk to you. Yes, yes Gauri tell me. Can you meet me in the Tilak Park? Yes, yes I'll just come. - I'll wait for you. - In another half an hour. Hey, how weak has he become. What has this happened to my Gauri, she has started looking old. Some become of the age and some become of the troubles of subsistence. He is not even bothered of asking that Gauri. How did you manage for so many days... then why should I bother? Still she has the same Haughtiness if this is it, then let it be. Why did you call me? You must have brought up your son and made him young. isn't it? And he is doing very well. In another few days I am going to get him married. I have also seen a girl for him. Don't exert your eyes in looking a girl for him. Ravi has already got married against your wishes and permission. What? Did you feel Jostle after listening to it. I have liked the girl. Where did you saw the girl? After getting married, Ravi came straight to me for getting blessings. When he is also unaware of the fact that I am his mother. Listen, now there is no use of scolding. I'll send him to you, bless both of them... And accept her as your daughter-in-law. You'll bring up your child and make him a young man. In bringing up a child, the manure of the affection is required. I have brought up my child and made him a young man. - Child? - Yes. One child you snatched away, and the other was in my womb. You couldn't snatch the child, isn't it? Where is he? He works in your factory... Umakant. Umakant he's so brilliant. Such a nice boy. Yes, he is only my son. Look at both the sons with a deep thought. You'll yourself understand. The difference between the mother's bringing up of a child and father's. I'll leave. Wait, don't you have anything else to say? Nothing. Hey, go, even after so many years, You still have the same arrogance. Atlest once she could have told me with love. That Shashi, take me with you to our house. Wouldn't I had whole heartedly taken her to my house. She says there is nothing to say. If there is nothing to say then don't. I have lived all these days without you. Then, I can also live the rest of my days without you, understood. Daddy. She is Monica. Monica Verma. God bless you. Daughter I am not happy with Ravi after this marriage has taken place. - But, you are the daughter-in. - Law of Verma family. And in this relation I welcome you. And I am sure. You'll respect the tradition and values of this family. What is your father? Daddy, now a days he is doing nothing. Previously What was he? He... he... he was a constable in the military. Daughter, being a constable one shouldn't feel ashamed. - Dubey! - Coming sir. What's it? Take the daughter-in-law upstairs and hand over here the house keys. - Alright, come daughter-in-law. - Go. Uncle. Come daughter. - Uncle, I need your help. - Hey, the help is granted. Now tell me, what kind of a help do you need? Uncle I... - Yes, yes tell me. - Actually. - I mean to say. - Yes, yes. - That I am in love with a boy. - Love. That is wonderful. Who is that boy? Uncle, you know him very well. Umakant. Greetings, sir. God bless you, my son. I have full faith that you'll keep Manisha happy. Sir, I'll try my best. Sir! No son there is no "sir" in a relationship. So uncle, will you handle my father? Daguther, your daddy is a very hard nut to crack. If you ask the permission for getting married, he'll never give. Oh yes, after getting married if you ask for his blessings... Then, you might probably get it. And my son what is the opinion of your mother and father? My mother yearns only for my happiness. And your father. My father I haven't seen him. - But I have heard that... - What have you heard? I have heard that he only yearns for his happiness. In bringing up a child, the manure of mother's affection is required. I have brought up my child and made him a young man. Alright. Alright. I�ll make you both get married. - Happy? - Uncle. [WEDDING MUSIC] Who? You! Why are you standing come in. I am here to tell you... that a mother alone can also not bring up a child. The child also needs father's love and affection. What do you want to say? Whom are you talking of? I am talking of your Gold medalist son, Umakant. He has got marred against your wishes and permission. Now, there is no use of scolding. There daughter-in-law is from a good family. I have brought her alone accept her. Listen, did you come to tell me only this. Yes. There is nothing more left in between us. What is left? What is left? Hey, you could have atleast told this much. That come Gauri, now come back to your house. What do you think? That only you are an obstinate even I know obstinacy, yes go. - Will mother scold us? - No, no. Go. She is waiting for you. Come. What rubbish! You have done the stupidity of approving to Ravikan't marriage. But I will not do the stupidity of approving to Manisha's marriage. R.N. Will your approval or disapproval break Manisha's marriage? And further more.. I am responsible for Manisha's marriage to take place with Umakant. - What? - Yes. Hadn�t I decided, that Manisha will become my daughter-in-law. That's why when Ravi got married to some other girl. Then, I got married Manisha to my second son. - Second son? - Yes. When guari left me and went she was pregnant. Alright, alright that means your second, Umakant. But he is unaware of it, and he shouldn�t come to know about it. He�ll not know about it, he�ll not know. First tell me. Where are they both? - To their honeymoon. - I see. "I am crazy for you." "This is pleasant days of love." "I am crazy for you." "This is pleasant days of love." "The lips sings feelings of heart." "This is vow to life and die together." "I am crazy for you." "This is pleasant days of love." "I am crazy for you." "Without you.." "Without you I had been so alone." "You have filled this heart with all the joy." "Now there is desire and hope." "I am crazy for you." "This is pleasant days of love." "I am crazy for you." "Such a pleasant time has come in life." "Such a pleasant time has come in life." "Don't ask us where were are." "We are lost in oblivious." "I am crazy for you." "This is pleasant days of love." "The lips sings feelings of heart." "This is vow to life and die together." "I am crazy for you." "This is pleasant days of love." "I am crazy for you." Yes, we have reached come. Get down, come. Hey, get down. Sister�s house has come. Hey, who are you people why are you stuffing in here? The way to station is there. Not here. What are you blabbering don�t you know who I am? Salute me. Son, tell him who I am. He is our father in English he is our dad. Yes of course that he looks like. Has floods come anywhere, are you a refugee, a fugitive, who are you? I am the Kinsman of Dr. Shashikant Verma. I am the father-in-law of Mr. Ravikant Verma. I am the father of Mrs. Ravikant Verma. Constable Binanath Tiwari, Salute me. Greetings, I am sorry I did not recognise. It�s alright. Children, get inside. Look, give the fare of the cart. [FOOTSTEP] Oh my God, Such a big house I never even imagined. Daughter Monica. Did you see, such a big family. - Yes, that of course I am seeing. - Who are you people? Have you heard the name of Dr.Shashikant verma. I am his kinsman constable Binanath Tiwari, salute me. I am only Dr. Shashikant Verma. You... you are only my kinsman. Listen, I am asking my kinsman itself... That have you heard the name of Dr. Shashikant Verma. I'm a bloody fool. - Father, when did you come? - Daughter. Pappu, how are you? - Mother... - How are you, daughter. I'm fine. How are you Munni. - Ravi, pay respects to your father-in-law. God bless you. Wow! You really look to be a son-in-law of a constable. It�s indeed a great honour for us that you have visited us. - You�ll stay here for 2-3 days isn�t it? - 2-3 days. Just now we've come. As of now, we haven�t yet thought of going back. Daughter-in-law, take you father to the guest house. Father come you must have got tired. Yes, I have got tired. Hey, get us something to drink we're feeling very thirsty. Can I speak with Mrs. Verma? Yes, speaking. Greetings. I am your kinsman Ramnarayan speaking, with your blessings. Brother greetings, I was about to come to you. Children did a big mistake of not asking and... Sister, forget about it... I was only telling that Manisha is my only daughter. And I can't live without her. Even I can't say without Umakant. There is an idea with your blessing. Neither Asafetida is required not Alum. But still the colour is bright. You come and stay with us. Brother don't mistake me on what I say.. May be your house is very big there we'll also get all the comforts. But still one's own house is always considered to be the best. The soul to remain in peace ask's for it's own home ground, sun, shade. Sister, I was expecting the very same answer from you, greetings. Daddy, what did she say has she agreed? You'll have to go and stay in your husband's house only. Aunty, What has happened that you have stopped coming itself. How can I come, even you have become a daughter-in-law's mother. You'll come to know the rate, of flour and grams. Hey daughter; daughter-in-law's are always bad. Aunty, even you must have been a daughter-in-law sometime. I was such a good daughter-in-law, that I have no words to express. I got daughter-in-law such like she is my boss. Have daughter-in-law ever been good? Hey, she is not a daughter-in-law, she is a female serpent. There is no remedy at all, of her bite. She'll bite at such a place where one couldn't get even water. The moment she came in I had a Jingling sensation. That she would definitely do something or the other. What have I done like that? Hey, daughter, when did you come? There was not even a sound. Does a female serpent ever give a sound of her presence? What have I done like that. That you are complaining with the old women of the neighbourhood. Hey, daughter-in-law be afraid of God. You keep quiet. Mother, stop on such people entering in to the house. I don�t like the crowd of such people into my house. - But daughter, listen to me. - Now, what is more left to listen. There is no remedy at all of my bite. I'll bite at such a place where one wouldn't get even water, isn't it? Why are you still here, go away. Get out. -Daughter-in-law... What is the impertinence. She has come to meet me. If you are so much interested in meeting them. Go and meet them in their houses. But, from today they will not come to my house. If this is your house... then my house. Sir, it's too late. Come on have food. Dubey. Have I ever had my food without, Ravi? God know when Ravi will come? Where have all the butters, gone? Bring the food soon. We are dying of hunger. Hey, why are you shouting, food will come. Hey, son-in-law, come, sit down... have food, sit down, sit down. Such a food you wouldn�t have eaten in your entire life. Ravi sir, has sat down for having food with his family. Should I bring you food here itself. No dubey... I have almost lost my appetite. From tomorrow, I'll cultivate the habit of eating without Ravi. After the marriage, the son has his own family isn't it? The father becomes an outsider. Hey, all my clothes have got spoilt. Impertinent, don't you know how to server food, don't you know. Sir, since 30 years I have been serving food. You learn to eat. Raghu. I have given my sweat and blood to this family. You can chop my head, but can't take the insult from stranger's. Are you watching. Yes Dubey, I am watching. When one thing is removed from its place. The other things turn upside down. Place the fridge and T.V over here. Hey, bring it carefully. Place the sofa over here. - Share it among yourselves. - Thank you madam. Mother, you have come, look now how does this room looks like? Daughter, where did you bring all these things from? I have not got all these from a junk shop after a bargain. I told to daddy, it's coming straight from the show room. You told your father it's not to be appreciated with. Mother, I can�t serve food to my dad on mat. Why can�t you? When sitting on a mat I can eat, your husband can eat. Then why can�t your father eat? He is not used to sitting on second hand furniture... And he is not used to eating on second hand table. Daughter-in-law. Stop leading you life as a daughter of Mr. Ramnarayan... And start learning, to live a life as the wife of Umakant Verma. Send all these things back to your father's house. Having brought them here, you have insulted your husband. He when complains about it, I'll see to it. In this house a little bit of my wishes should also be considered. After all, it's my house. - Manisha, what's the matter? - Ask you mother. Before the marriage you never told me. That I�ll have to take the insult from your mother. If you want your mother, be here, I am leaving. - Manisha, listen. - Leave me. Listen to me. Hey, I want to go for a drive, give me the car keys. No sir, this is big boss's car I can't give to anybody. Hey, you son of a big boss. Don't you know that I am your big boss's kinsman. And the father-in-law of small boss. Which means that I am double the owner of this house. Come on, give me the keys. No sir, I�ll not give. What, you'll not give, you'll not give. You'll not give the key, how ill you not give? Without my permission, how did you dare to take my car? Permission... In my, son-in-law's house. What is the need for me to take the permission? Son-in-law's house, means my house. All the things of this house are mine. Get out from here. I say get out from my house. Get out, who are you to drive me out from here? You get out. How dare you, then wait. Get out from here, get out, get out.... Get out from here, go away, go, go... Run, run, run, get out, run. Save me, save me, save me, Dubey, go away. I am dead! Rascal! Save me! He killed me. - You fool, get out. - Help me! - Daddy! - Help me. Help me! I'm dead. Daddy! - Daddy. - Go away Ravi, go away, leave me. Aren't you ashamed of behaving like this in a slavish manner. You impertinent, what did you say? Daddy! Come. Come, now we don't have to stay anymore in this house, come. "Who decline own children..." "he'll decline by unfamiliar."

Daughter so you have come. But, if you would have come a little time ago, then. A little time ago what happened? Daughter, a little time ago a time disaster took place. Where is your sir? He has gone. - He has gone. - Yes. What's the point of staying in the house when relation is broken. Ravi sir, raised his hand on the sir. What? Raised the hand. Today has he become so big. That he has started raising his hands on his father. Where is he? Ravi! Oh mother you. Dare you call me mother. You sinistrous.. That father, who brought you up both as a mother and father. You raised your hand on him. That father, who sacrificed his entire life for you sake. You raised your hand on him. That father, who has been living alone for 25 years, for you sake.. You raised your hand on him. - Rascal! - Mother! This is only that sinistrou's hand, isn't it. I'll cut this hand of yours. You, you call me mother isn't it. Then, in this relation, I give you a curse that you from you children... Madam, madam. Madam, don't to this offence. Don't give a curse to your own blood. - Madam. - Yes. [CRYING] - My mother. - [SIGHS] Yes. [CRYING] Mother, Mother. Mother, Mother. Mother, hit me more hit me more. Mother, cut off my hands. But just once, just once call me your son. Call me your son mother, call me your son. I will not. I will never call you my son. Only for this day did I see the dream of you becoming, a young man. Ravi, unless and until, he forgives you I will never call you my son. - Where is Guarri? - She has gone. She has given me these keys to give it to Umakant. - She has given the key. - Yes, what else she could do? For the sake of her son she kept sacrificing her entire life. But the son turned out to be worthless. Umakant! Good morning, sir. It is very bad morning for you. Sir. This house is better than that house, isn�t it. Which you left and came. Here there are carpets costly furniture, heavy curtains. All these were not there in that house. But, in that house there was a mother. Helpless mother's love was there her blessing's were there. Mine and your father-in-laws entire wealth put together. Cannot be equal to even a moment of your mother's love. And that mother, who kept herself away from her hard-hearted husband. So that, you could leave her... for all these materialistic pleasures, isn't it. - Tell me, Rascal, tell me give me an answer, tell me. - Uncle. - Tell me, you worthless tell me you useless, leave me. - Uncle. Why are you beating my son-in-law. I have all the rights even to beat your son-in-law. But at this time, at this time I am beating my son. Son. You. Means.. Meaning that, he is your father ask for forgiveness. Daddy. My daddy.. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy forgive me. I will never forgive you unless and until your mother forgive you. Mummy! Daddy! Daddy, forgive me. Daddy. Mother, forgive me. Mother. Guari, you.. You have come home. Gauri! Gauri! Guari, forgive me. It was my mistake... Why did I exile you to leave the house? No shashi, it was my mistake you forgive me. Why did I ever leave the house? Hey, in the obstinacy of proving one's own mistake. Don't start the fight once again with your blessings. And see, both your dear one's are standing with shame. Forgive them also. You repented, this is your punishment. We forgave you this is our love. One small mis-understanding has separated us both. You both don�t commit this mistake. Alright, now we'll leave. Where? With you blessings. Friend, we owe 25 years of our life to each other. We have to make each other realise the meaning of "separation". And understand the meaning of "union". Gauri come. "This season.." "This season.." "This is the season of love."
