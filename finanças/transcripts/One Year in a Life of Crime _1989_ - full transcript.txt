I wish for a big business. So I can make money. Make my-- I'm just not gonna wish I got money. I want to work for it, have my own business. So that I can make a million. Alpert: A big business. That'd make you happy? Fuck, I'll take a million. Buy my own business and still have money. Sid: What took you back to the streets, Rob? I'm-- I'm anxious to find out this right now. -(chuckles) -What grabbed you? 'Cause you were doing good here. Well, because it wasn't paying enough. It wasn't paying enough. But you were doing good. You had over a grand in the bank. Over a grand in the bank. You were doing good, Rob. Rob: Now I ain't got nothin' in the bank. Sid: That's what I'm sayin'. -Now what you're doing, you don't have anything. -It don't pay! Now what I do, I just make enough money to put gas in my car every day, buy a little food, pay a little bills. -I ain't got no-- -Another thing. You were happier too when you worked. You came down here every day and you showed me your bank book and you were happy about it. Of course I was happy. Yeah, 'cause it was legit. I said, "Sid, I got money. I earned it." -That's right, that's right. -Earned it. And it was legit, and, uh... for a year it worked out-- You know what I was thinking about, Sid? If I, like, get some money together just to buy, like, a big hot dog truck, just to start me off. And I see a hot dog truck for sale. It's not a truck. It's just the back that you hook up to your car. Even that. Yeah, I see what you mean, uh, the back door. But, uh, still you'd have to... How you gonna get the money for that? Got any rich uncles? -Any rich friends? -Nobody. Are you asking me for the money? (laughs) You probably don't got it. If you gonna do right, I'd give you the money. I'd find a way. Alpert: What, do you think that these guys are gonna be able to-- to change what they're doing, Sid, or not? Yeah, they'll be able to change. It's gotta be within them though. Can't nobody-- I don't think anybody else or any program will change 'em. It'll have to be... instilled in 'em. What do we steal tonight? Oh, man. Well, I want to steal me a car. I'mma tell you right now, I'mma steal me a car. When we walk back. No, I want to do it now. Fuck all that. I want to get it right now. Go back to the house and get me a vice grip and screwdriver. (indistinct) Oh, come on, man. Why you gotta act like that, man? (indistinct shout) Just like that. I don't want nobody to get my plate, man. -Just like that. -Just like that. I don't know what's in there. Alpert: There was about five people watching you. -Don't mean nothing. -Alpert: Huh? Anybody got the plate? Anybody got the plate? No one was even watching. No, don't worry about that. Alpert: What's in the box? -I don't know. -Shirts. Shirts. (indistinct) It's for the poor people that ain't got money. We-- we give 'em cheap prices. Now, we ain't taking no food stamps now. It got to be cash. These are bad shirts, like tiger. (all laughing) Well, you can't be perfect when you steal everything. Hey, you can use them for pajamas. (all laughing) It got a zipper. I'm giving away free shirts. (excited chatter) Oh, man. Oh, man. This is so nice! -Can I have it? -Rob: (chuckles) Yeah. Fred: Rob from the rich and give it to the poor. Rob: The stuff that we threw away before, everybody's picking out the garbage. That's why I did it. So people can just take it. I don't want to try to sell it. Let people take it. (all laughing) We always give stuff out. Alpert: Would you give this stuff away if I wasn't filming? Yeah, we always do, you know? Don't believe him. This is his first time. Alpert: It's your first time, huh? Ah! The first time! (stammering) I've always been giving stuff around. -When I can't sell 'em-- -I always give shit away. Alpert: Yeah, uh-huh. Look, go. (babbling) (blowing raspberries) Do what I said! (loud laughter) Uh-oh. Uh-ooh. (laughing) Alpert: What're you gonna do if you ever catch your daughter doing anything bad? -Whoop her ass. -Alpert: Yeah. She looked at me. She's not gonna do nothing bad. Alpert: Did you ever spank him? Yup. Alpert: You ever beat him up when he did anything bad? -He got a fork in my arm. -Alpert: Huh? A fork. Alpert: He stabbed you with a fork? When you tried to discipline him, yeah? -How old was I? -Seven years old. -Five. -No, it wasn't that. No, no. He didn't spank me. I was about five years old. Ed: He knocked a tree. I knocked a tree down, so he-- so he-- I had a bunny rabbit. He grabs the bunny-- the bunny rabbit and starts ripping the ears off of it. And I loved the bunny rabbit. So I took the fork, I didn't know what-- All I knew, I wanted to hurt somebody. So I just stabbed him, and the fork was sticking out. And he's going like this. Alpert: You still got the scar? You got the scar from it? No, I don't have it. Never rip up your little kids' toys. They go crazy. A little toy they like, never do that. 'Cause then a lot of people say you're teaching your kid that. -You don't throw away his toys. -Alpert: Yeah. One time, we lived in a big apartment building. They had a furnace where you throw the garbage. I had a box of toys. This motherfucker takes boxes of toys; throwing it down the furnace. Alpert: Why? Why would he throw your toys out? 'Cause he was drunk. What do you got to say about that? I wasn't drunk. Rob: You was always drunk. Alpert: Was that part of the thing that disturbed you when you were a kid? That your dad was always drinking. I was never disturbed. -Never. -Alpert: Yeah. What I do now, it's of my free will. Alpert: I can't believe you just walked out of the store with it. -Yeah. -Yeah. We took it out the window and walked out. It was just collecting dust. -Right. -So we collected it. Alpert: You get nervous when you see a cop like that after you do something? -Rob: No. -Mike: No. 'Cause they don't know nothing. If he knew, we'd know. We'd know if he knew. (whispers): Received probation. I was surprised. The prosecutor was surprised. I mean, shocked. Afterwards, we both went to the judge and said, "You know..." The state should have, uh, presented this as part of one indictment. I believe they're collaterally estopped at this point. Therefore, I'm asking for a dismissal of this indictment. All right, thank you, Mr. Kramer. (indistinct), would you be kind enough, uh, Mr. Conker, to advise the court when it is officially a dismissal, we can close out our fine? -Yes, Judge, all right. -Okay, thank you. Thank you, Judge. Alpert: So, have they dismissed the thing against Freddie? Well, yeah, he submitted it for dismissal. It will be formally dismissed in a week probably. It goes before the judge. Alpert: So he's not gonna do any jail time? No. Alpert: What? How can he get away with that? Well, there was a screwup in the police department and in the prosecutor's office as well. (indistinct) This is my little baby, little girl, Elizabeth. And this is my old lady, Maddie. Alpert: Did she know you were going out and robbing stuff? Yeah, she knew I was going out and robbing stuff. She didn't care. Alpert: You ever talk to him and say, "Listen, Freddie, you should straighten out and stop doing all the stealing?" Well, yeah, I told him that last night. 'Cause he says he's scared of getting snagged and he's gonna get ten years. Yeah, she told me to stop. I'm planning on stopping, but, um... it's not that easy. I'm addicted to shoplifting. Alpert: What's this? They sell auto parts. It's a car mall. Alpert: How many times you been in there? Ah, couldn't even count 'em. So many. I usually park my car here on the side, leave it like this, leave the keys in there, and go in there and come out. (clattering) I got a burglar alarm to stop thieves. -Alpert: What? -A burglar alarm to stop thieves. Alpert: That's what you stole? Yeah, I stole a couple of 'em. I got a couple of 'em in the trunk. This is (indistinct) street. This is where they sell all the drugs and... -Alpert: Yeah? -All the dope and all the coke and shit. Picture them over there. Alpert: All these guys are dealing here? -Fred: Drug addicts. -Alpert: Yeah? (indistinct chatter) (indistinct chatter) Four bags of heroin. Yeah, don't it look good? Wait till you see it in the cooker. Alpert: But you're not supposed to be taking that stuff. You're supposed to stop. I know, but, um, it's hard for me to stop, it's not easy. You know? I'm gonna go get some coke to mix with it. Go buy me a new set. Gonna go home high as a kite. $60 worth of heroin, $20 worth of coke. Alpert: Freddie, how long is the longest you've lasted without ever getting high? Fred: I'd say a week. I used to get high on the first day of parole, a couple hours later. Alpert: So, Freddie, after this, how long is the next time before you're gonna have to get high? Well, I don't have to get high because after the first time, I won't catch a habit, but if I do it tomorrow and the next day, I'll have a habit in three days. Then I'll have to do it two or three times a day. To support my habit. (indistinct chatter) (indistinct) No, it's too small. You try it here. I haven't tried it here. What the fuck now? It's disgusting, ain't it, Jon? (indistinct) Alpert: When did you start taking dope? Uh, about... between 13 and 15 years ago. My uncle was the first one to turn me on. He caught me in the shower when I was taking a bath one day, and he was getting off and he skin-popped me. And then after that, I never did it again. Then a couple years later, I always wondered what it was, you know? So I seen this guy doing it, and I told him, "Why don't you turn me on? I want to try it." And he gave me a little bit. I tried it and I liked it. Alpert: And how long has it been since you've been out of jail? Uh, about a week approximately. I got out last Tuesday and today is Thursday. About a week and two days. Alpert: Where'd everybody go? Where is everybody? My old lady left. She left me. She went over to her mother's house. -Alpert: Why? -I don't know. Alpert: What, she just left and took the kids? Fred: Took every fucking thing. Yeah, took the kids and left. I don't know if she's coming back or not. Alpert: You think maybe because of the drugs? Well, she found that I got high one time, you know? And, uh, she went off on me. I think it could be that, you know? But, uh, I told her I wasn't gonna get high no more, you know? Alpert: (chuckles) But you did. What can I say? Alpert: What's that? Fred: That's my picture in jail, when I was in jail. I told her, you know, if she was-- If she was gonna do this to me, she should have just left me in jail, and did it to me in jail. At least I would have been in jail and wouldn't have to worry about it. Now, I'm out here in the street. My wife, my kid... Son of a bitch. I feel like turning to drugs. I don't know, man. Alpert: You knew when you took that first shot, that it could get you in trouble, right? Yeah, but, uh, I don't know why I did it. But I did it but then I said I wasn't gonna do it no more, and I haven't done it no more. It's been a week since then and I haven't done it. And, look, my arms are clean. I haven't did nothing, you know? Alpert: Rob any store since I saw you last week? Yeah, I robbed a couple because I needed the money, you know? I got to eat and live. I can't get a job. I tried to get a job. I can't get a job. You know? I don't know what to do. Alpert: Look, Freddie, what's gonna happen? I mean, you keep bouncing in and out of jail. And every time you bounce out, it's always the same deal, right? Yup. I tell you, man, if I go back to jail and I get... pshhh, a lot of time, I ain't gonna be able to handle it. I really ain't. I got nobody. I wish I had somebody to help me, man. Hey, Sid, what's up? So what's the problem? How come you can't straighten up? I've tried to straight up, man. And, hey, I'm not even getting high-- I know what happens on the street. I know that. I've been out here-- I've been-- look, all my life. I know a lot happens out there, boy, but you gotta-- you gotta use your mind and get around this stuff out here, boy. All that-- Stop throwin' all that on you, man. You got to take it easy. Fred: I am. I'm gonna try. You're not gonna see 35! I spent part of my life in jail. Close to half so far. Since you was, what, 13, 14? Since I was 13, 14. I got a juvenile record for burglary. And now, a few years, uh, in county. Yeah. Been down-- That's enough to make you wanna say, "Stop, that's it." "-Hey, I do. I do want to stop. -Getting too old for this stuff I wanna change." And I was expecting to do the right thing and I was expecting to stop, but then my old lady left me. You can't want it hard enough. You can't. Okay, Sid, I'll talk to you next time. All right, all right. And, look, you be cool. -Oh, I will. -Take it easy. -Stay outta trouble, man. -I'm trying. I'm trying. -I'm really trying. -See you once in a while. I wanted to know about a funeral 'cause my mother passed away. The minimum price range comes to about $670. Of course, this would all have to be paid in advance. We can use what they call an alternate container, which is a cardboard box, or we can use what they call a wooden box. This is a plain wooden box. (indistinct) If you want cremation, that's $85. No way I'd get that goddamn motherfucker even if I rob a fuckin' bank. Is you crazy? Come on, let's get out of here, man. -Thanks anyway. -Okay. They tell me, $65 to pick her up, $50 for a cardboard casket, $100-- $90 for the makeup, and then they say, $500 for the burial ground. They're talking about thousands of dollars. Fuck, I'mma take care of thousands of dollars. Fuckin' nuts! I hadn't went and visited her much. I was saying, when she dies, then I'll regret I should have went every day. My mother always told me... she didn't want me to shoplift or do nothing wrong, 'cause she don't want me to go to jail. Always said that. Man: And told you to get married. Even like your mother said, Robert, you could sit here and break up with me and go with somebody else, but there ain't no other girl that's gonna stand behind you like I did. You better do what she tells you. Marry Angela. Will you make your mother's wish come true? Rob: What? Marry you? Marry me, yeah. Might as well. I heard that. I heard that. Now you gotta get married now. I'll be the best man. I get to be-- (loud siren and honking) Rob: Grand opening. They should have good prices today. Mike: We're gonna go in there and see if we can get some razor blades, make some money. Rob: Mike, Mike. -That lady is from Harrison. -Mike: Harrison. Rob: Jon, Jon, Jon, the lady who works here is from Harrison. She knows me. Forget it. What are you doing with these? Don't fuck with it. Mike: I thought this was it. We got boxes of Feosol. These go for like $6 and $5. I get like $2.50 a piece for 'em. You know, when I called her to get the batteries, she's seen the Feosols on the floor. Rob: Well, they gone now. She ain't seein' no more. She seen all the boxes on the floor. She ain't seein' no more. Seen how she started watching you? Damn right, I was big as a cow, man! You should've helped me get the hell out. You just fuckin' ran around. All: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Woman: Oh, my God. You get a birthday cake from me as your present. Alpert: Whose birthday? Your birthday? Mike: Angela's birthday. -Alpert: Aw. -Mike: Old Ang-Ang. Cut it open, look. Rob: Here's what I got her. Alpert: What is it? Rob: Something for every time she break up with me, she can put another guy in the book. No, it's a book. -Alpert: A photobook? -Photobook. -Cost $20. -Mike: Paid for-- Bought it.

Get me something to drink. -Alpert: Getting married? -Maybe. -Alpert: Getting married? -No. Alpert: Huh? Come on, tell me, what? No, 'cause he doesn't wanna get married. Mike: I said, "Maybe." That is a paycheck! Ed: Not yours! Mike: That's a paycheck. My girl works hard. Alpert: What? She works and gives you all the money? -Right. -She doesn't give it to me. We share it.

(indistinct chatter) Alpert: What-- What're you fighting about? 'Cause she's hard-headed and don't listen. And she's gotta learn to listen. Rob: Mike, you ain't gotta hit her. Yes, I do. 'Cause that's the only way you concentrate. -Woman: Rob, would you listen-- -You better shut up! -I told you! -(woman crying) I-- Get in that hole. Get back in that hole. Get in there. (crying) No, please. My God! Get in there. Somebody's on a phone in here. Now you get back in there. Rob: Forget your troubles. Come on, be happy. Stay in there with the door closed. Get the cat off the bed 'cause it got fleas. Woman: Wait, it's hurt! It's hurt, Michael. You're gonna be hurt in a minute. Fuck the cat! I saw, like, how they call this a birthday. Alpert: What, do they fight all the time like this or not? Who? Alpert: Mike and his girl. Boy: Every night. -One time with a bat. -Alpert: What's that? Angela: This ain't no damn birthday! One time with a bat. Alpert: He hit her with a bat? -Rob: Why did Mike hit her? -Alpert: Yeah. I try to stay out of their business. I just-- He told me that she wanted $50 to give to her mother. But she wanted $50 to give to her mother to hold for her, so she has enough for an abortion. Mike don't want to have an abortion. That's why he hit her. She's tryin' to be sneaky. She deserved it. I enjoyed it. I know you did 'cause you were sitting there laughin'. I would never hit my girlfriend. Oh, come on, Robert! And you! You! I'm not-- Ow! She hit me! Good! Go run into the bedroom and cry. (Alpert speaks indistinctly) Alpert: Every night? How often? Pretty much with him. I like to, um, always have somethin' to do. Same place, 10 times, in the eye. You better watch it with that damn knife. 3-D! (clinking) Get outta here! Boy: Did you ever see the (indistinct) drop? Alpert: Rob, why do you hit her like that? She likes it. He's staying happy. Aw! I didn't even hurt you, big baby! Yes, you did. She's a mean old lady. Alpert: Ange, do you like it? When he plays around, yeah. But when he hurts me, I don't like it. 'Cause when I hurt him back, he gets all pissed. Just like he'd be going like this into my damn bone. Nah-ah-ah! No, I wanna show people. Now, come here. It's the bone here. Come here. The see the bone. The bone here, you put your hand and you grab it like this. Ouch! Now I tell her to do it to me. Boy: I tried real hard! Look. With two hands, she can't even hurt me. Whoaaa! Wish you'd have fell. Would've deserved it. The only thing that's hurtin' me is the scrape on her nail, that's it. There's no scrape by my nail! Ow, that shit hurt! Even when I do it to myself, that shit hurt. That's 'cause I'm all bony. I don't got no meat to cover my bones. All right, lock the door. Lock the door! Alpert: Everybody wound up getting smacked. How come you take this? Woman: I ain't taking it. Alpert: Well, you say that, but you took it then, right? And you're still here and you take it. Woman: So like I'm really gonna leave... (mumbling) (laughing) I like how you, "Really gonna..." (mumbling) Woman: I ain't saying shit. Alpert: But you all-- You, I mean-- You're gonna be here tomorrow, you're gonna get smacked tomorrow. Jon, you don't understand. You don't. Alpert: Explain it to me. Me and Robert's been going out five years, been livin' together for five years, plus I had Jackie. And he still wants more. Alpert: Yeah, but he still smacks you around. Not as much. Alpert: You used to get smacked around more? The first time he hit you, what did you say to him? That I hated him and I wanted to leave him. Alpert: Yeah? Then he said he'd never hit me again. He cried and he promised me he'd never hit me again. He did it again and again and again and again. And that's it, I'm not taking no more. No matter how much I love him, I'm not gonna sit around, let myself get hit like this. Hittin' me don't prove that he loves me. He can't beat love outta me. 'Cause he don't know how to handle love. Alpert: And what're you gonna do with yourself when you get outta here? Get rid of this baby. I ain't crazy. Whoever is watching this, don't think I'm crazy 'cause I ain't this fuckin' stupid. We've only been going out two months. I ain't gonna take this shit from him. Didn't you ever hear the saying... "If you love a person that much, you'll stick behind each other through bad and good." Got the secret now. You jump up and tuck. Try it. Easy! I can't, Rob. I'm drunk, man! Rob: I'm drunker than you are! I'm gonna go get Mary, you comin'? Alpert: Mike, what're you gonna do tomorrow? Tomorrow is your, uh, arraignment. Mike: I ain't goin' anywhere. -Alpert: Why not? -Fuck that! They gotta find me. They-- I'm not-- Listen, I put it like this, I don't care if I go to jail, all right? But I'm not gonna go and turn myself in, so they can just lock me the fuck up right there. Let 'em find me first. You know what I mean? Am I right? -Like we was talking in the car. -Yeah. Alpert: So what? You're just not gonna show up? Ain't gonna show up. Alpert: What are they charging him with? Man: Conspiracy to commit theft, third-degree theft, fourth-degree receiving stolen property, fourth-degree hindering apprehension. Um, in... light of the crime problems we have in the city of New York and the county of Essex, they're not very serious charges. These are, uh, at the bottom of the scale. So, uh, I'm-- I don't know why he's not showing up. Alpert: He's certainly not in the courtroom at the moment. Uh, we're gonna call the pleading list first. As your name is called, please answer, "Here." Thank you. Jeffery Robert DeVone. Officer: No answer. Michael W. McGrath. Officer: No answer. I have no idea where Michael McGrath is. I haven't talked to him yet. He's been notified to be here. Officer, please call out in the hall, "Michael W. McGrath." See if he's present. Michael McGrath? No answer, Your Honor. Very well. No answer with respect to indictment 2464-8 of the 84th term, Michael W. McGrath, no appearance. Mr. Prosecutor, do you have a motion? Yes, Your Honor, the state would move for a bench warrant and forfeiture of bail. Very well. Bench warrant will be issued for the arrest of Michael W. McGrath, and whatever bail posted will be forfeited. If he shows up, especially if he turns himself in, I might be able to make a convincing argument to the judge to, uh, have the bail reinstated. Alpert: And this was just to begin the trial, right? His trial hasn't even started yet, has it? -No. -Alpert: Uh-huh. So actually what-- It wasn't smart of him not showing up today? It was, uh, dumb of him not to show up today. Okay, we'll be waiting for your call. Don't forget, we gotta get him into court. It's a necessary thing. All right, bye-bye. That's it. Alpert: How much money you stand to lose if Mike doesn't show up? $1,500. -Alpert: Seriously? -Seriously. Alpert: And his mother, how much money is she gonna lose on his bail? Uh, she'll lose, uh, approximately $600. What can I do? It's up to him, not me. Alpert: But you're gonna lose the money that you put up. How much did you put up? $600? -750. -Alpert: Yeah? 750, I put up. I don't know. Alpert: Well, did you know that he wasn't gonna show up today? No, I didn't. Had no idea. -Alpert: You know where he is? -No. I don't. That's all the questions you're gettin' outta me. Alpert: Okay, but he just cost you $750. Yep. Kid wants to go on the run, that's his business, not mine. Alpert: Yeah. -So what're you gonna do? -What am I gonna do? -Alpert: Yeah. -I don't know. Alpert: You got half of New York lookin' for you. -I'll move outta New York. -Alpert: Yeah? I'll move to the half that ain't lookin' for me. Okay. Right, Ange? Alpert: You think he's gonna be able to keep himself outta jail? Eh, if he does it slick, he will. Plus I got a car, I got some money, you know? So I'll be all right, believe me. I'm gonna make it. They ain't gettin' me. Well, we got all the information that we possibly need to effect an apprehension on the above subject. Now we just gonna have to go out on the street and get lucky. He's, uh, 5'9", 150 pounds. -How're you doin'? -All right. What's your name? John Doe. Why? What happened? You got any tattoos on your right hand? Not on my right, I got one on my left hand. Let me see it. That's all I got. I got Jesus Christ. That's about it. Show your thumb. Thumb? No, I ain't got nothing on it. That's it. Can I ask who you're looking for? Maybe I can help you out or somethin', you know? -Yeah, I know him. -Where is he? I don't know where he's at, but I know him. We're looking for Michael. You sure he's not here now? Woman: You can check if you want but don't let them know you're here. Go upstairs. -Okay. -Boy: You can go check upstairs. Okay. Alpert: So that's it for today, Len, you think? That's all for today. Alpert: Yeah? You got a prediction? -We will get him. -Alpert: Oh, yeah. We always get our man. Michael, five cell. Close four cell. Motherfuckers, man. They was waiting for me, out in front of the house. -Alpert: Where, on 13th street, Robert's house? -Yeah, yeah. They chased him for several blocks, in fact, into a different city to the city of (indistinct). Well, Mr. McGrath then bailed out of the car and, uh, they located him hiding under the garage. Placed him under arrest and, uh, the rest is history. Alpert: So you just gotta stay here then until what? -Until whenever. -Alpert: Yeah? (sniffles) How come you're crying? I can't take this shit. I miss it out there. Alpert: You said they were never gonna catch you. -They got lucky. -Alpert: Yeah. Turn sideways, look to your right. All right, that's it, Mike. Take that thing off your neck. When can I make a phone call? It's been two days and I made no phone call. My mother and stuff don't even know I'm here. Okay. As soon as you're arraigned, we'll let you make a phone call. But we'll see if we can get you your phone call before-- I was supposed to make it in the police station. Every other time I got arrested, I made it in the police station. Fine. Before the day is out, you'll get a phone call, Mike. You've been telling me that for two days. You'll get a phone call before the day is out. I promise. You're gonna help me out when my bail comes, right? (crying) I need you. I-- I gotta get outta here. I gotta get out. I'm serious. It's just everything went wrong at once, you know? That's bothering me. You stayed over there? Mom's gonna help me out? Huh? Mom is gonna help me out? (crying) Michael, say goodbye, that's it. Okay. Matter of State vs Michael McGrath. Is there anything you wish to say by way of mitigation of punishment, or lessening of punishment? If so, I'll hear you now. I lost a lot since I came in. And I just wanna get back out there as soon as I can so I can, uh, get my stuff back. And... I don't-- I'm-- I feel sorry for what I did, believe me. That's all. Judge: This defendant has an extensive juvenile record consisting of such crimes as larceny, eluding police, criminal mischief, receiving stolen property, possession of a dangerous weapon, and trespassing. Twenty-two complaints made against this individual as a juvenile encompassing some 39 charges. Fourteen of those charges were sustained. He's been incarcerated as a juvenile twice! It would appear that those periods of incarceration did not act as a sufficient deterrent to this defendant. Incarceration is required in the Court's opinion, primarily to protect society with the expectation that it'll act as a deterrent to this defendant and others, and as punishment. Accordingly, Michael McGrath, on accusation 184-85, you are hereby sentenced to imprisonment for a term of seven years. On count 2 of indictment number 2464-8, you are hereby sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years. And hereby committed to the custody of the commissioner of the Department of Corrections, and until released in accordance with law. Under the law, Mr. McGrath, I must advise you that you have 45 days in which to file an appeal of this sentence if you so wish. -Do you understand? -Yes. Judge: I must further advise you that if you cannot afford to hire your own lawyer to take that appeal, you may make application for the services of a public defender lawyer. -Do you understand? -Yes. Judge: You may remove the prisoner. Man: Okay, okay, (indistinct), come on. Can I speak to the lawyer? (overlapping chatter) -Yeah, he's gonna be okay here. -Alpert: All right. (Mike speaking indistinctly) Alpert: Michael, you're still in jail. Yeah. Still here. (lock clicking) Alpert: You weren't supposed to be in jail this long. What have you done in jail to keep you here this long? I got-- I broke a lot of the penal codes, so to say. I got caught with drugs. I got sent back from my halfway house and they took a urine test. It came back positive for containing, uh, codeine. Fightin'... Not that I-- you know? "They make the rules, I break 'em," that type of attitude. Alpert: Tell me which of these, uh, rules... you've broken while you've been in jail? Mike: Assaulting any person. Assaulting any person with a weapon. Um, fighting with another person. Threatening another with bodily harm. Possession of-- "Introduction of a gun, firearm, weapon, sharpened instrument, knife, or unauthorized tool." Alpert: I mean, they've got maybe 50 rules up there for behavior in jail, and you've broken at least half of 'em. Yeah, I have. But... you know, that's the way it goes, man, you know? Alpert: Michael, honestly, are you ever gonna change? Yeah! I'm changed, man, uh-- I'm different, man. Alpert: You broke all the rules out in the street. You come into jail, you break all the rules in jail. I'm not breaking all the rules, just some of 'em. I'm-- I'm bendin' 'em, you know? I'm-- I'm not breaking 'em. Alpert: What's inside you that makes you like that? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just against it, man, you know-- I've been coming to jail since I was 13 years old. And, like, beat up by cops, uh... Alpert: What-- What's inside you that makes you the way you are? A hatred for cops, I guess. Uh... You know, authority, man. Authority, period. You know, I-- I don't want-- I just don't like listening to these people, man. Okay, Hector, you take care. Officer: Mr. Ruiz was found with, uh, stolen articles in his car, approximately $700 worth of, uh, designer towels. He was released on bail for a further hearing, uh, next Tuesday in our municipal court. Alpert: How often do you have to have cocaine? How often do you have to have this? Like, some days... see, I say to myself, "I'm not addicted." You know I am, of course. Shit, I hope I am, after all this shit. Wasted fuckin' mucho cash. He's-- He's messing himself up. He's messing himself up all the way. And he knows it, but I ain't gonna say no more. (hacking) See, I hate what he's doing but I can't-- I can't-- He-- He's a grown man, I can't tell him what to do. Alpert: What message do you think people should get, seeing what your life has been like? All right. You want a message. Don't shoplift, get a damn job, stay the hell off drugs, and you'll live a better life. Period. And if you don't wanna listen to that, go ahead and steal, go ahead and do drugs, and watch where you'll be at. And then you'll be like, "I should've listened to Rob." Ha, ha! Don't do it!
