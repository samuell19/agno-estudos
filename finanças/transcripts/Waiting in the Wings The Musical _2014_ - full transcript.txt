I knew I could count on you. - What about me? - Trevor nice job with the props, make sure you go get the camera. - Oh I got to fix these doves. - Oh I have to go get the pink lights from the baptismal. - Don't touch the holy water, I have a feeling you're allergic. - Trevor. - You know I think its terrific that you can audition for an off Broadway show by just sending a video. - I know, I never thought I'd have a chance to audition for a show in New York. - It's not an audition, it's a contest. - Oh Trevor it's all the same. - Anthony must I remind you that you've submitted to every talent scout known to man? - This is different, it's a legitimate competition. - With a $25 entrance fee? - Your negativity is not affecting me. Everyone will be singing the same show tunes you always hear, I thought of something so creative and so unique they'll have to take me. - Oh you'll be taken alright, for $25. - Again, your negativity is not affecting me. - Oh va va voom.

Can you at least sift through this crap? - Totally. - Tony, do you have any motivation at all? - Yeah when working out. - There's more to life then working out. - Hey this body pays for half your mortgage. - Yeah it's a very sad world we live in when a social worker from New York has to rely on income from his brother, the stripper. - Hey, wait a minute, I just won this online contest. America's Strip Search, watch this. Hi, I'm Tony from New York. I look good on camera. - Ugh. - Girls want me, guys want to be me. Mom's love me and don't even get me started on the grandmas. - Not Mrs Delvecio. - I'm dogs best friend, conserving water's important to me, I am America's hottest stripper. Oh watch this, the best part, ready? I could be good or I could be oh so bad. The end. - Tony how long do you think you can make money using just your body? - Look I know this is hard to believe but I'm not a complete idiot. - I never said complete idiot but when you apply for your first professional job what are they gonna think of your resume? - It's always gotten me work - In strip clubs. - Four across, oh that's gotta be tutu. - After shower wear, I think it's robe. I don't think most people wear tutus right after the shower, most people. - Calling all off Broadway actors. - Oh I wonder who that could be. - Ethel! - There's my shining star. - Ethel. - Honey how you feeling? I can't even imagine, I haven't been able to sleep at all. Ever since I heard you got that off Broadway show I had a little something I wanted to give you, open it. Open it, open it. - Okay, oh this is the picture from the first show we did together. - Peter Pan. - And it's a map. - Of the New York subway. I got this the day I moved to New York, on my 21st birthday. Now Anthony I went to New York with big dreams, and a small pocket book, I never booked a show but this map represents the best year of my life. - Well I can't accept this. - Oh no no, I want you to have it, it'll be like a little piece of me is there with you while you're gettin' a bite out of the Big Apple. - Thank you Ethel. - Oh you're welcome. - Trevor you just have to look at this. - Oh. - What's this? - Looks like a contract to me. - Oh business, I'm more the creative side you know. Which reminds me I've got to start working on the church talent show. We cannot let Saint Augustine win again. I'll see yah, toodle doo. - Bye Ethel. - Priceless. - I can't believe this is actually happening. - You know I honestly think they might have heard about your award for best three minute comedy monologue for all high school seniors representing the south central region of the greater Montana state division. You know even though it was almost two decades ago it still really is an impressive feat when you think about it. - Hey that was a big deal, my reenactment. - Stop, don't you think it's time to take this down and replace it with a mirror? - No! Some dogs playing poker. - Or the opening night Playbill you get from my new off Broadway show? - Anthony I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it to New York. - What? - It's not that I don't want to see your show but I just, I got my new promotion and they probably won't let me leave. - But the show runs for three months, I mean can't you squeeze in a long weekend? Tom your boyfriend. - Ugh. Fine Tom your best friend just got a show in New York and you just can't miss it. Trevor it's the first big thing I've ever checked off my dream list. - Don't be so disappointed. You know if it wasn't for my job you wouldn't have the opportunity to live the actor's life. - Hey, I work. - Yeah yeah and on your pay we could live out our soda pop wishes and Mac and Cheese dreams. - Well my forms are complete, it's official. - And you read everything before you just signed your life away? - Yes daddy. - Okay I've got all the contracts returned and signed by the performers. - Strippers and the off Broadway performers? - Yeah, you know after looking at the revenue from the application fees I can see why we're casting these shows with online contests. - That's why we call it show business. Having strippers from all over the country's a perfect gimmick for this club, now what I'm concerned about is this little off Broadway thing you've convinced me to do. - Well if you would let me sit in on casting. - Now you want to be a casting director, what do you want to be a producer or a casting director? I hired a professional to cast the show. Do not touch the casting. - By the time we sit in on a dress rehearsal it's gonna be. - I don't need to see shows, I need to see revenue. - Well of course but as producer you will be. - Out of town for the next three months fundraising. - You're not even gonna be here? - You make these two shows successful, I'll make you a partner. Then you can keep producing your art. - You really mean that? - Make me money. - Okay, okay, okay, - Then we'll talk. - I got it all under control. - Money. - Money! Okay! Oh balls. Theater, stripper, Anthony Richardson. ♫ When I was young I thought of love ♫ As something like a dream ♫ I'd meet a man ♫ A man who'd make my heart sing ♫ So foolishly I waited for my prince to finally show ♫ But when no one ever came I vowed to just let go ♫ And then one day I met your eyes ♫ And there was something more ♫ A feeling that I had not felt before ♫ My knees went weak ♫ I couldn't breathe ♫ I thought this can't be true ♫ I found true love the day that I found you ♫ I found true love the day that I found you - Hey sorry I'm late but I can just jump right in. - You're not late gorgeous, we're just early. - Now that we've all finally arrived I'd like to welcome the original off Broadway cast of the complete and unabridged history of American musical theater in 90 minutes or less, the musical! I'm Bob your producer and this is your director and choreographer Michael. - Thank you, we have a lot of work to do before we open, so everyone get ready to dance. - I love that motivation, can't wait to see you all opening night. - Rita, we'll stage your number tomorrow. Everyone put on your dancing shoes, I know you were all cast by online submissions but I can't wait to see what we actually have to work with. Everybody get your tushes on stage. Yeah, yeah. Cute kicks. - Oh thanks. - Where's your dancing shoes? - The dog ate them? - Alright, here we go. Starting on the right foot and step, shuffle, step, shuffle, step, shuffle, step. Flap, ball change, flap, flap. Step, shuffle, ball change, step, step and wing and paddle and paddle, step, step, pull back, and step shuffle, step shuffle, step shuffle, step.

Are we not dancing today? - I'm just soaking it in. - So am I honey, so am I. - Okay can I have your attention please? Come on, thank you, thanks. My name's Bob and I'd like to welcome all of you here. - Are you our director? - Actually I'm one of your producers. Kelsey is your director but he's busy finishing another project across town today, however I'm leaving you in very capable hands. This is Lee. Lee's worked with Kelsey before and he's agreed to get you situated, they're all yours. - Thank you. - Hey guys, congratulations to you and me for being America's hottest strippers. Now Kelsey wants you to remember that when you're themeing your strip numbers that we're from all over the country so really play up something that your specific state is known for. - What does this have to do with the musical? - He's funny. - I have a problem. - Yes, malnutrition. - You're Anthony Richardson, is that right? - Yeah but this isn't what I auditioned for. I didn't even feel comfortable taking my shirt off in South Pacific. - I'm not really sure what that means but you read your contract. - Well I read all the rules to the contest. - Most strippers do, strip. - Don't worry Anthony, it's just rookie jitters, I'll help you out. Alright guys, Kelsey wants us all to remember your numbers have to have something about your state pride in them and Kelsey will need the music for that number in tomorrow's rehearsal and the Broadway Barn is having a warehouse sale. Check them out, we'll see you tomorrow and welcome to New York. That's good, it's good deal. Anthony. Alright first we have to pick a stripper name for you. - I don't even think we have strippers in Big Timber Montana. - Big Timber, are you serious? - Huh? - Oh you don't get it, well let's think, Big Timber, big, long, long wood, Anthony Longwood, it's perfect! - You know I just don't know about the stripper thing. - You don't really have a choice unless you want to pay your contract penalty and buy your own ticket home. - I can't go home, everyone thinks I'm in a show for the next three months. - Well if you're not stripping how are you gonna afford New York? Rent alone is like 1.500 bucks. - Well maybe I could audition for another show. - How many shows have you booked in New York? Exactly, just come to the costume warehouse with me. I'll take care of you. - Well I do need a new top hat. - How's your new stripper job going? - I think you mean how's my new musical job going. - Musical? - Yep. - Like musical musical? - Uh huh. - Why? - Shit I'm out of beer. - Okay for every answer you give me I will give you a beer. - Go on. - Alright, how did you get cast? - Not sure, I think my video submission got somebody's attention. - Have they heard you sing? - Not yet, it'll be a surprise. - These are professionals, don't you think they're gonna catch on to you eventually? - I had them eating out of the palm of my hand. - Why are you insisting on this? Where are you going? I am not done. - Yeah you are, all I wanted was three beers. - I wish I had this costume access at the church in Montana. Oh my gosh, this place is incredible. Oh oh, a sailor suit! - That's not what we're here for Anthony, focus. - I could do something from Anything Goes. Cole Porter? It's a musical. - Oh sorry, I don't know that much about musicals but what I do know is there aren't many sailors in Montana being that it's a landlocked state and all. - Oh but you're from California, you could be a sailor. - I already have my number. - Well if you change your mind you'd be perfect. There's so many great sailor songs out there to sing. - I can't really sing. - Everyone can sing, it just takes finding the right song. ♫ The world needs music - It has music. ♫ No as in a musical - Oh. ♫ Like food and water - Shh, people are staring. ♫ It is intrinsical - That's not even a word. ♫ Everyone knows human beings have certain ♫ Essentials in order to live ♫ But beyond just the minimal day to day ♫ Stipend of eh I am positive is ♫ That this world needs - Music. ♫ Yes but in a constant stream ♫ Alive in daytime ♫ Not simply lost in dreams ♫ And then someday when everyone's handed their score ♫ In libretto then maybe you'll find ♫ This almost whole world ♫ Embrace all human kind - Very nice, are you done? ♫ No quite this world needs music ♫ Each day I live to see would just be better ♫ With four part harmony ♫ Oklahoma is probably not the first state ♫ That a musical brings to your mind ♫ Yeehaw ♫ That in the first truly American musical ♫ Comedy you're sure to find ♫ That oh what a beautiful morning ♫ Music queue in the oohs and ahhs of backstage chorus ♫ Is sure to cure the blahs ♫ So that on the day everyone's handed their score ♫ In libretto we surely will see ♫ Altos and bases ♫ Tenor sopranos ♫ Live in harmony - Oh my God oh my God ♫ Sing my angel of musicals ♫ Play a pipe organ then ♫ Light some more candles ha ha ♫ To brighten up my den ♫ Andrew Lloyd Webber knows writing a musical ♫ Can be an art form which that ♫ Isn't limited to struggling dictators wives ♫ Deformed phantoms or trains even cats ♫ Meow meow meow meow meow ♫ Meow meow meow meow meow ♫ I love musicals ♫ Meow meow meow meow meow - Ow! ♫ No matter how this world attacks us ♫ And no matter what they say ♫ We can warm up stretch and belt out ♫ I sing another day ♫ When the hills are alive with the sound of music ♫ Of all life's moments ♫ Then even our off days ♫ Would soon become a 10 ♫ Thank you Rodgers and Hammerstein ♫ Who would have thought ♫ That a winning equation would be ♫ Seven motherless children a heartbroken captain ♫ A nun and a singing Nazi ♫ Nothings off limits ♫ Like as in cabaret ♫ Although there's Nazis ♫ The end seems bright and gay ♫ No matter how this world attacks you ♫ And no matter what they say ♫ We will form a ♫ We sing another day ♫ The world needs music ♫ 'Cause you're not fully dressed ♫ Until some orphans ♫ Have sung and danced their best ♫ Infused with magic ♫ And life is better 'cause ♫ The vocal soundtrack ♫ Is sung by folks from Oz ♫ Now add some muppets ♫ From Avenue A to Z ♫ Then just mean curse words ♫ Come on play on for me ♫ Despite the threat of war or famine ♫ Against all the bourgeois ♫ We will not be miserable ♫ We sing anther ♫ Do you hear the people sing ♫ Ah - I don't know what just happened but. - I know, I don't usually get such great backup in Montana. - Can we please just focus on your costume? - Oh sure, is there anything specific I should be looking for? - It just needs to be made of fabric that we could put Velcro on. Well yippee yo ki yay. - In our 2002 Our Lady of the Plains annual talent show I brought down the house with the song Ragtime Cowboy Joe. - I'll listen to it and I'll see what I can do. - Oh it's my boyfriend Trevor, I gotta take this. Hey Trevor, I was just getting ready to call you. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm great, super even. I hate to ask you but could you send me some money? - How much money do you need? - Well $1.500 should do it. - What exactly will $1.500 be doing? - Oh I've been mugged. - Oh my God, are you okay? How are you even getting around the city? - I still have my wallet, they just stole my suitcase. My screaming scared them away. - Do you still have your man bag with Ethel's treasure map in it? - As luck would have it yes. - Good, I figured you might have some kind of emergency so I hid $500 in the inside pocket. Just use that until your next payday. - Yep there it is, um well crisis averted. - Crisis averted. - Oh you know my break is over, I have to go. - I miss you Anthony. - I miss you too. - Well you have enough money to go home, I guess you're all set then. - Yeah right this is home, at least for the next few months. - What if you just told your boyfriend the truth? - Trevor, oh no, he'd never trust me to do anything again. Besides I'm in New York City, I have one chance to make it. - How are you gonna pay for it? - I have my ways. Thanks for your help. - You're welcome. - Quick cash? - Sperm. - No, really? - We are a sperm bank so we pretty much just collect sperm. - Is there anything else I could donate instead? - Sperm bank. - How much does it pay? - Well that depends, is your junk highly sought after. - How would I know that? - Let's file a quick evaluation shall we. - Social economic level, upper lower. - What are you doing? - Filling out your application like you asked. Ugh, you must have a bad memory, minus three points. - You're grading me? - Just a standard form, how tall are you? - Five foot three. - Oh. - What? - Well you say baby making is primal, it goes back to caveman times when a woman looked for the strongest mate to ensure the survival of her offspring. So we're looking for tall, dark and handsome, well you're short and pale and minus five. - But but, I. - Stuttering, oh that's gonna cost yah. - I don't stutter, you just made me nervous. - Anxiety issues, oh we are not doing well. - I'm sure I have positive qualities people would want in a kid. I have a background in the arts. - Oh an artist, in New York City. Go on, do you have any special talents or awards that I should know about? - Well I did win an award for the best three minute comedy monologue for all high school seniors representing the south central region of the greater Montana state division. - Oh you're serious. Oh well that is practically like you won an Emmy. - Can you just tell me how many donations I need to make $1.500? - $1.500, here fill a hundred of these. Next! ♫ I love you with a song that's true dear ♫ I love you with a song that's new ♫ Hear my song ♫ I sing of love that's pure ♫ My songs an overture unto a symphony ♫ Of life long love ♫ I freaking love you did I mention ♫ I really like a lot love you ♫ Love love - Oh come on! - Love it, love it, love it! Thanks everyone. - I think I'm hurt. - Take a 10, everybody! - Help. - Hate it, hate it, hate it. What are you doing Michael? - Well don't look at me, I didn't cast this abomination. With a few casting tweaks. - No no no, no tweaks. Look Michael, you're brilliant, you know you're brilliant, I certainly know you're brilliant, however what you're doing with the show is not brilliant. Make it work or you'll be looking for work. - Tony! Can I talk to you for a minute?! - What do you need? - Tony, you look good. You know you look good, I certainly know you look good. However you're not making my choreography look good. I love you kid, but I love my choreography more, make it work. Dear God make it work. - Hey, so you're a pretty good dancer huh? - Oh you think I'm pretty. - You're only best in the entire show. - Oh well flattery will get you everywhere. You know if you ever need help. - How are my show boys doing? - Oh you're barking up the wrong tree sweetheart, we're gay. - I'm straight. - A straight male musical theater performer? A straight hot male musical theater performer? - Yeah. - Too bad, I was gonna offer you some personal dance instruction. - Oh well I'm bi, yeah, I'm bi. - Bi huh? So you're saying you can't decide between the melons and bananas? - Well I know sexy when I see it. - Okay, I'm gonna get some water. - Flitter away ballarino. - Oh but hurry back. - Weren't you getting water? - Yeah, but I'll be back. Tony would you like some water? - Sure. - I'm fine, all good thanks. - Wow, well um, how exactly long are rehearsals. - I'm guessing you haven't done many musicals. - No. - How tragic. - I'm more of a dancer. - I'd say you're more of a hottie mchotterson. I can help you privately with the vocals, call me. - You're a fire eater? - I can swallow anything. - Here you go. - So you said you can help me with some private dance instruction. - I did, tomorrow you buy me lunch, well have a manicure and we'll fix your eyebrows. It'll be fabulous. - Well could we maybe start on stuff with the show first? - Eh, sure sure, good idea. - Good. Look you're the one who told me to make a career change. Okay this was handed to me so I figured why not take it? - When I was talking about a legitimate career I really didn't mean the theater. - I'm gonna make this work. - But why this? - 'Cause I don't want to end up being a 40 year old joke. Peter's a really good dancer. - So you're using him? - Whatever. - It is one thing to bounce from girl to girl every night but you have to work these people. - It's harmless Aaron. - Your victim is here. - Hi Tony. - Thanks for coming. - Well looks like somebody's ready to rehearse. - You don't think it's too tight? - I think it's perfect. - As long as you say so, I'm new to this whole dancing thing. - Well you're not a strong dancer but you are strong. Now we need to work on your pirouette. - My pair of what? - A pirouette, watch and learn. - Oh the spinny thing. - Yeah. - Yeah I got it. - Oh hi. - Thanks. - You gotta spot. - Where? - No, oh skip it, let's do the choreography from the show. Love Song, and five six seven eight. In out, yes. - Shit, she's early, you gotta go. - Oh but I just got here. - I know but there's some stuff I need to take care of, you know business stuff. Can you come back tomorrow? - I'll come back every single day, what are you doing? - You're gonna use the private staircase. - Yeah but what's wrong with the stairs that I came in? - They're painting the hallway. Rita, just use the stairs, the elevators broken, fifth floor. - Shit. Hello new student. - Wow, you look hot. - What, this old thing? It's just a, you have a piano? - Yeah, great aunt Bea just left it to my brother Aaron. - Would have been nice to know before dragging this all over God's creation. Stand up straight, spit out your gum. Let's get started. - Okay, I think I liked old Rita better. - She just left, let's start with scales. - Nicely done. - No, repeat after me. - You can sing it in your own octave. Do me a favor, when they give you a solo in the show, pretend you have laryngitis and it'll buy us a few days. - I thought you were gonna teach me how to sing a song with words. - Are you saying you've never sung a song before? - Why would I do that? - I don't know, out of happiness. To express yourself! To shine light in a world of darkness. To impress the chicks. - I usually just impress chicks with my body. - I can see how that might work. But how are you going to impress a cultured girl like me? - Alright, here we go. ♫ There was a time a mythical time ♫ A time called the Golden Age ♫ And there were songs such memorable songs ♫ That flowed from a Broadway stage ♫ Nowadays the performance style is to never over do it ♫ The minute that you get too big and cheesy ♫ Man you blew it ♫ If you want to add some emotional weight ♫ Just talk at a pitch ♫ 'Cause the pain is too great ♫ And the thing that makes you sure to book ♫ Is to use a subtle distant look ♫ It's so fun performing in ♫ Contemporary musical theater shows ♫ You can stand real still ♫ And then occasionally strike a little pose ♫ It's a bit like movie acting ♫ Broadway arms are just distracting ♫ From the information packed in these contemporary ♫ Musical theater shows ♫ La la la la la la la la la la la la ♫ Wait ♫ Maybe having everything so scripted ♫ Has it's flaws ♫ But now's not the time or place ♫ To work that out because ♫ This is an example of ♫ Contemporary musical theater style ♫ Check your watch and you'll discover ♫ That this number has been going for a while ♫ When the story keeps extending ♫ Every song is never ending ♫ And then there is the tag ♫ With a different musical theme ♫ The coda mustn't drag ♫ So I start to pick up steam ♫ For a finale that is certain ♫ A lowering of the curtain ♫ I big loud rift out ♫ Contemporary musical theater note ♫ Ah ah - Anthony, what are you doing here? - I still have a few details to work out and then I'm out of here. - Alright everyone, let's start rehearsing the opening number. - Just follow them, you'll get it. - It goes like this, here we go and march, march, up and down, and scoot it and scoot it, now show the muscles boys. Now whip it, and turn it. - He really knows how to dance. - Of course he does, he's won tons of awards in choreography. You know strippers do dance. I was a professional ballet dancer. - Then why are you stripping? - Because I needed some cash. - Don't feel overwhelmed boys, we have all day to get it. From the top, five, six, seven, eight. And march march, up and down. - And I life from here? Oh I don't even do this move in the show. - Sorry I'm early I'm just so excited. What's going on? - Nothing, nothing at all. - Peter and were just hanging out. - Why are you wearing that? - What? 'Cause Peter thought that it would be perfect for those things that I have to do. - That's not important, what are you doing here? - I was just coming by for our date. Aaron was leaving and he let me in. I thought it was just gonna be the two of us. - You're dating Rita. - He's crazy about me. All I can say is that the last time I was here there were a lot of ohhs and ahhs, weren't there Tony? - Rita means is I was singing and she was like ohh, ahh. - I know what that bitch means. - Back off Mary, he's mine. - Rita, you better watch your back because I believe in equal rights and I will hit a girl. - Hey. - Oh with your big strong muscles, I'm so scared. - Oh! - What? - Ow! - How do you like this, ow ow. - Get off her nipple! Peter, Rita you can't. The two of you need to just calm down okay. And who do I protect from who? - It's not important and for future reference, throwing water at us doesn't actually do anything except get us wet and not in a good way. - Well maybe he thought he'll be melting the witch. - Look can we just please get back to the show stuff. Come on guys. - Tony's right. Peter to show you how much this situation has disturbed me and what a kind hearted person I am, I'm gonna find you a nice hot guy. - Oh it's okay, really. I have plenty of guys. - No it's time to move away from those tourchate kicking musical theater men. I'm gonna take you to the Banana Peel. The best all male strip club in town. - Well I can always use some naked men. - I love helping the unfortunate. - Wait a minute, what the hell just happened there? - We resolved our differences and moved on, keep up Tony. And besides, I want to make sure Peter starts looking at other guys. - Tony, are you coming along? - Nah, I think I'll pass but can you still come over tomorrow and help me with some more dancing? - Well sure thing, even if you're dating Rita. I think you need me in your life. The show depends on it. - Thanks. - Happily ever after, now get out. - What? - Get out, faster, why are you taking so long? You should have been out two minutes ago. Goodbye, see you tonight. Oh you owe me for that one. - For what? All you did was make shit up and piss Peter off. - Oh you can thank me later. - Thank you? - You're welcome. Oh don't worry, Peter's still gonna help you with the dancing but you can drop the whole bisexual crap. - What do you mean? - Oh you're heterosexual and you know it. You just gave up the chance to go to an all male strip club. - Fine, okay I'm straight but how long do we have to pretend to be dating? - Okay well if you insist I would love to be your girlfriend. - I don't think I'm really ready for a commitment right now. - Oh but we have to get to work. I don't want an unemployed boyfriend. - I'm so glad you're here, are you ready? - Well I got my cowboy costume today. - And I got a sailor suit. I was told there's some great sailor numbers out there. - You'll be great, I wish I was as prepared. - Don't worry, I got you covered. I brought Ragtime Cowboy Joe into the 21st Century for you. - Oh thanks darling, have a fun time boys. - Thank you. - Who was that? - Kelsey, he's a drag queen. - Oh but he's so talented. No one's gonna take a drag queen seriously. - Not when you're Gloria Inexcelsis, one of the greatest drag queens in New York. Let me tell you something little boy, I worked my ass off, I've choreographed on and off Broadway and in my spare time I started a non-profit organization for runaway teens. - I didn't know you did all that. - What you don't know can fill an encyclopedia. You can't spend your life trying to please everyone Anthony. - I really didn't mean to offend him. - I know, I'm just really proud you're here. ♫ This man is your man ♫ This man is my man girl ♫ From California there to ♫ The New York island here ♫ From the redwood forest ♫ To the gulf stream waters ♫ This man was made for you and me ♫ As I was walking that ribbon of highway ♫ I saw above me an endless sky way ♫ I saw below me a golden shh ♫ Valley girl get your head out of the gutter ♫ This man was made for you and me ♫ Over there over there ♫ Over there over there ♫ Send the word send the word over there ♫ That the Yanks are coming ♫ The Yanks are coming ♫ Yankee Yanks the drums are drumming everywhere ♫ And we won't come back until it's over here ♫ Well all around you ♫ Our voices sing ♫ This man was made for you and - I'm Gloria Inexcelsis and these America's hottest strippers. ♫ You're a grand old flag ♫ You're a high flying flag ♫ Don't drop that letter L honeys ♫ It's dangerous ♫ And sit your ass down ♫ We come in bed - I salute you all. I see that some of the boys in the audience are saluting me right back. Let's cast our anchors away to the Pacific Ocean, where the golden states leading lover is swabbing the poop deck. ♫ Oh hey sailor ♫ Aye captain ♫ Ahoy ♫ All hands on deck ♫ Fleets in ♫ Ahoy - Wow, I mean wow. - Thanks, it's almost your turn. - I don't know if this is a good idea. - You'll be great, besides you make a really cute cowboy. - Yellowstone isn't the only natural wonder that Montana can boast.

So listen up, the cast is set. You'll be in the show tomorrow night buckaroo, and you will dance like a stripper! - Yes sir. - Anthony, Anthony are you okay? - Me? Please that was crazy fun, I'm going home to celebrate. - Can I come with you? - No no, I always celebrate alone, have a good night. - Peter, where are you? You've missed half the show and it's just getting good. Oh, excuse me! - Sorry, sorry! - Whoa. Anthony, you have some pretty awesome theater credits. - Thanks. - I'm Rita, what happened in there? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You got booed off the stage. - You know I shouldn't be in there, I came to New York. - To be discovered? To become a star? - Maybe, I'm just not all that comfortable taking my clothes off. - Oh please, sometimes as an actor we have to take on challenges we're not completely comfortable with. Besides there could be some big directors in there one night. - No big time directors going in there. - Alright, yes no musical theater directors are gonna be caught in a male strip club. - Not fair, you don't even know. - 'Course boys are discovered in strip clubs all the time. - Really? - It's like putting in your dues. And you have talent so eventually you'll get cast in a real show but you need to bring sexy back. - That might be a problem. - Oh I see, maybe you're just not that good of an actor. - Listen I happened to win an award. - Turns out I speak sexy fluently and I love taking on insurmountable challenges. To dream the impossible dream. I'm gonna make you my new project. - Really you don't have to do that. - I know, that's what makes me so nice. - But do you know anything about stripping? You speak Tagalog? I'll see you tomorrow afternoon, I have tons of ideas and my boyfriend was a stripper so he can help us out. - I just don't. - You're welcome. ♫ They say that theater will never die ♫ Here's how it survives ♫ No patrons are as loyal ♫ As those who need a mohel ♫ But as for the light loafer-ed fairies ♫ And discontented wives ♫ Whose attending matinees ♫ It's gays and Jews ♫ And girls who need love ♫ Who goes even to the plays ♫ Its gay and Jews ♫ And girls who need love ♫ Three different species that somehow combine ♫ Lambasting lighting and costume design ♫ Raising Mantello LuPone and Lapine ♫ TKTS has one hell of a line of ♫ Gays Jews and girls who need love ♫ They say that theater will never ♫ Die ♫ We know that it's true ♫ We'll market to our niches ♫ The hebs and queers and bitches ♫ The locals and also the tourists ♫ And that will see us through ♫ Who wants Phantom just to close ♫ Some gays most Jews ♫ But not girls who need love ♫ Whose investing in the shows ♫ It's jews it's jews jews ♫ Come on you know you are part of the squad ♫ You pray to Sondheim instead of to God ♫ Some men defecate you were the pawn ♫ We'll never judge or tell you it's odd ♫ No we'll raise our razors ♫ And quote Sweeney Todd ♫ So raise up your way over priced cabernets ♫ A toast to the women the dudes and the gays ♫ 'Cause we only work when the audience pays ♫ We love you gays Jews ♫ And girls who need love - No!

You're a sadist. - What I do on the weekends is none of your concern missy. Tony, come sing. - I don't think it's such a good idea that I sing right now. - What? - Tony why don't you tell everyone the truth. - What do you mean? - Well the doctor said you shouldn't be speaking and no singing for at least two days. - Oh yeah, I forgot I was trying to push through it because I didn't want to let everybody else down. - It's the easiest number in the show, Helen Keller could sing that number, with laryngitis. Is this the only number I'm doing in the show? - Just be thankful I'm not allowed to touch casting. Rita, let's run true love, take notes, you might learn something. - Can't learn pretty. - Bitch. - Show me what you got.

I forgot about the naked. - Well you better start remembering. - I just remembered I gotta go to church. - My boyfriend would not approve. - He's gonna think you're hot. - Trevor? No he's much more conservative then I am. - Not possible. - He actually thinks I'm out here performing in a big musical, one of the ultimate checks on my list. - What list? - My dream list. I keep it with me all the time, it keeps me inspired. - Can I see it? - No. - Can I see it? - It's personal. - Can I see it? - Fine. - To see the world by performing on a cruise ship, ew. Be the voice of an original animated feature, good one. Sing a duet with a famous Broadway diva, any particular diva? - I have one in mind, but I'm not picky. - You'd be surprised how small the theater world is. - Speaking of theater I'd really like to come see your show. - Oh, it's just a hole in the wall production. - Community theater? - Practically now let's keep rehearsing, come on, do your number. - Again? - Yes again. - Rita you sound fantastic. - Thank you. - Ahem! Hi. Yeah hi, when I said I wanted to be featured I didn't mean as a horse. - And what would you suggest, Cinderella? - Listen fancy man, your fatal mistake was telling me that you couldn't touch casting. - You wanted to be featured, you're featured. I'm still the director. - This is horse shit! - I want everyone in places in 10! - Girl these snickerdoodles go straight to my thighs. - Will wonders never cease, never though we'd see you here again. - Sorry about last night everyone, I mean you were all gorgeous and I. - Oh no. - Shut up Beau! Anthony we're glad to have you back. - Ohh, aww, what could it be? - What's in the box. - You don't want to know. - It's what's gonna save my number. - Is there a real stripper in there? - Hey boys I hope ya'll. What's this? - It's a stripper in a box. - Well make sure you pock some air holes, live and learn. - It's not a stripper, it's the new pop to my act. - You don't need pop, you need prayer. - Don't let these boys get you down Anthony.

Not a word about our Broadway show. - Off Broadway. - Whatever, it's his dream to perform in a Broadway style musical like us and I don't want to hurt his feelings right. - You got it babe. - Yes. - Peter? - Yeah sure. - Welcome to the theater. - Well I'm glad to be here. Luckily my audition ran short, apparently Dream Girls is not my show. Lee, what are you doing here? - We have a musical surprise for you. - Are you gonna sing something from the show? - What you mean Rita hasn't sung her soon to be award wining song for you yet? - Peter, don't plug the show. - Well actually I've been trying to get the information from her since. - Oh it's on 50th and 8th. - That's the Broadway theater district. I thought you said it was a community theater. - Ew community theater, I would never. - Anthony moved to New York to be in a musical and I didn't have the heart to tell him we were in one but apparently you do. - Um should I. - Maybe next week sweetie? - Beau we're all waiting on you. - Well you got about seven more minutes because I'm smoking my Slims. And what can we do for you? - I'm so sorry I must be in the wrong place, my friend Anthony Richardson's in an off Broadway show. - Oh the boring theaters are over. Wait, did you say Anthony Richardson? - Are you Anthony's boyfriend? - What, why would you say that? Anthony, ugh no we're just roommates. - Right, well you found the right place and since you're just roommates I'm sure they wouldn't mind if I snuck you in. - Oh, thanks that's mighty nice of you. - Yes, quite the boy scout. - Just smoke your Slims. - Show time. - Trevor, what are you doing here? I wanted to tell you. - Yeah I can see how it would be hard to tell me you moved across the country to prostitute yourself. - That's not how it happened. - Why should I believe anything you say? - Listen I wanted to tell you. - But you didn't. I can't be with someone who does this. - Listen if you'd just let me explain. - It's not all about you okay, I have a reputation too. - How's this gonna effect your reputation? We're just roommates, right. - We both agreed that everything would just be better. - No, you agreed. - We're not gonna have this fight.

Shouldn't it say Anthony Longwood? - No, that's not my name. Lee picked that name out for me the day we arrived. No one uses their real names when they're stripping. - Well isn't it funny because your name is Anthony Richards. Ohhh! - Uh oh. - Oh no. - Eek! - Huh? - Don't you understand what this means? - No. - Were you dropped as a child? Nevermind, you, my boyfriend Tony Richardson who was a stripper miraculously got cast in a musical from an online contest. You, my project Anthony Richardson, a musical theater performer who never stripped a day in his life ended up dancing in a strip club from an online contest. - I gotta go. - Wow Rita you are flexible, you just put both feet in your mouth at the same time. - Oh no no, don't pin this on me Mr I could clarify things you just can't say. - Oh let me take care of, I'm just able to make it a. - of the theater queen who. Oh wait wait, everyone's gone. - Still here. - Quick we got to get to the office and talk to Bob. - Right we'll take the private stairs, it's faster. - Private stairs? - Private stairs. - Oh, private stairs. - Get me some beer while you're at it. - The gig is up mister. - Oh you better have and no one's here. - Bob I'm gonna give you a piece. - Save it sister, he's not here. - Where is he? - Well if I knew that I'd be talking to him right now wouldn't I. - Where is Anthony? - Bob, excuse me Bob are you there? - Everybody hide. - Hello? - What's all the racket? - Oh I'm sorry, do you have a moment? - I suppose, come in. Is this about the mix up? - You knew? - You didn't? You're a smart kid, I thought you'd pick up on it faster. Well, faster then learning to strip. Look I'm really sorry, I didn't figure out anything was wrong until two weeks in when I was writing your pay checks. - Well then why didn't you just. - Switch back? With the musical opening that week? Tony wasn't horrible and you'd already proven yourself. - So what now? - I'll tell you what, I think I have your headshot here. - Here's my new one. I thought I could be your assistant until something opens up. - I'll keep it in a special file and if anything becomes available you'll be the first to know. - Thanks Bob, you have no idea how much I appreciate, what are you doing? - I know you're from Montana Anthony, but you can't be that naive. - What do you mean? - I mean we all have dreams. My dream is to be a Broadway producer and for that to happen you'll both stay in your respective roles. Come on Mr Longwood, I'll see you out. - A-hole. - Rude. - His mama did not raise him right. - Tell the drama to your mama. - What drama? - Bob told me you might be quitting. - Listen, just 'cause my dreams are dead doesn't mean I'm gonna turn my back on people living theirs. - Oh baby, they're not dead. They're just in a coma. You'll get your chance. You know Anthony, it took a while for you to grow on me. - Oh like a flower? - More like a fungus but didn't take Lee long. - To what? - You know, he's always encouraging you. He redid your music, asked for an advance on his salary so you could stay in New York and leave the show. - Wonder why he would have done that? - Hello honey he likes you, he really likes you. He wouldn't do that just for anybody. And guess what Anthony, you like him too. - Wait how do you know. - Woman's intuition. - I'll talk to him after the show. - Oh. - Are you crying? - Oh honey you're sweet for thinking I still care. ♫ This man was made for you ♫ I'm Gloria Inexcelsis and these are ♫ America's hottest strippers ♫ You're a grand old flag ♫ You're a high flying flag ♫ Don't drop that letter L honeys ♫ It's dangerous ♫ And sit your ass down ♫ We're coming back - Anthony! - Ethel! Sorry. - Oh honey, I am so proud of you, why would you be sorry. Listen I have not missed one of your performances yet, why would I miss one when you're gonna show a little skin. I wasn't born yesterday you know. - Obviously. - Hells bells, first Lee went behind Anthony's back and snuck his ex-boyfriend into the club and now this hootenanny. - Really Beau? - The truth shall set you free! - You did what? - It's not what you think. - Anthony why don't we meet you outside when you're ready. Ethel why don't you tell us all about Montana and farms. - And cows. - And dirt. - Anthony. Anthony just talk to me. - I have nothing to say to you. - Oh the drama of the theater. - Is everyone having fun without me? - Oh come on no, as a matter of fact I'm having a lovely time getting to know your friends. - Well I'm glad you got to meet them before I leave. - Where you going? - Montana. - Why Montana? I mean there's nothing for you there. Now honey, this is where you belong. - This is where you belong. You can stay with Tony when your contracts up. - Huh? - I mean you took his job, it's the least you can do. - Well he took my. - It's settled, why don't you take Ethel for a night out on the town, besides I'm exhausted. - Exhausted? - Shut up Peter, I'm tired. Have fun tonight. - They are fun. You know there was a diner, yeah I used to love to go there when I first came to New York. - Alright, what are you up to? - Me? Nothing, I'm not up to anything, technically. - So after about a week, you when you, oh thank you, in New York I started doing research on your new musical. - I know I gave you the theater's address to send cookies but how? - Well I did a web search on the address and I ran into Brian's stripper blog Mr Big's in the city, oh wee. Yeah, oh and I keep up with all his updates, 'cause I certainly don't get any from you. You know I did see your version of Ragtime Cowboy Joe long before tonight. - It's online? - 50.000 hits. Gypsy Rose Lee would be so proud. Unlike your ex-boyfriend Trevor. - I should've told you about him a long time ago. - Oh honey, I've known for years. - You have? - I'm old but I'm not stupid. No I figured he was pretty good for you at first but he never really understood your dreams. Hey but this Lee, looks like he believes in you. - He lied to me. - Fibbed to you, I have a friend who wasn't entirely honest the whole summer but I still love him. - You know Ethel, if I stay in New York we're really not gonna see much of each other. - Anthony Daniel Richardson, we will never ever be far apart and if you feel like you're missing me just listen to your heart. Too much? - Maybe a little. - Boys, you look great. Lee chill out, you're making me nervous. - Are you sure it's not a little too much? - Have you met Anthony? - I see your point. - Hello Rita! - I'll be out in a minute! - I brought my tap shoes but I really don't think we're the same size. - Hi Anthony. I'm sure I'm the last person you expected to see here but I have something for you. We know I can't give you like an off Broadway show or anything like that but I wanted you to check on dream off your list. So just. - Oh. - Hello. - My. - Hello? - God. - HI. - Oh my God! You're Shirley Jones. - Oh my God you're right. - What are you doing here? - I think the word your looking for are thank you. I'm your dream come true. Sing a duet with a Broadway diva, check. - When I was a little kid I practically broke my VCR watching you in Oklahoma and The Music Man. - And Carousal? - Well that one was a little sad for me. - If it's gonna be this way the whole time I'm gonna have to charge more. - Oh oh, did you say you were really gonna sing a song? With me? - I don't think we have any other options. Do we?

If fact I'd probably glue it to my. - I carry it in my heart. - Aww, so you have any advice? - Let me think, perhaps you should round up your height for your resume. - To the next inch. - No the next foot. And don't singalong with the actors onstage when you go to see a musical. - But what if it's one of your favorite songs? - Don't. Just try to be yourself. - That's it? - Anthony you have a long list of dreams and goals, I know someone who has a list with one thing on it and you're it. Some things are better then a spotlight, but not many. - I just love her. No one's ever done anything like this for me before. - Well maybe we could get some more dreams checked off that list? - It's a very long list. - I have some time. ♫ The world needs music ♫ As in a musical ♫ Like food and water ♫ It is intrinsical ♫ Hear our voice ♫ Hear our song ♫ Who ♫ Who ♫ Who ♫ Many times our lives are spent ♫ Buying time and paying rent ♫ Waiting for that one bright day ♫ The good Lord shows the way ♫ Searching for the magic sign ♫ To unlock the grand design ♫ After all the time you'll find ♫ You've been waiting in the wings ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Take your mark and take a chance ♫ Take a breathe and get to dance ♫ With the voices we will sing out ♫ That we're not waiting ♫ Waiting in the wings ♫ Understudy goals are best ♫ While we wait our turn and rest ♫ Our performance will be great ♫ Til then just sit and wait ♫ But if you look around you'll learn ♫ The show has started it's your turn ♫ The one in which your heart has yearned ♫ Wasted waiting in the wings ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Take your mark and take a chance ♫ Take a breathe and get to dance ♫ With our voices we will sing out ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Everyday is a new song ♫ Don't forget to sing along ♫ Every step or move you make ♫ Isn't always a mistake ♫ The secret is that the time is now ♫ Live your life and take that bow ♫ You'll be living life as how you'll stop ♫ Waiting in the wings ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Take your mark and take a chance ♫ Take a breathe and get to dance ♫ With the voices we will sing out ♫ We are waiting ♫ Waiting in the wings ♫ Time to light and curtains up ♫ All the world's a stage ♫ There's no small role for all us out there ♫ Turn the page ♫ Turn the page ♫ Take the stage ♫ Take the stage ♫ Oh ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Waiting waiting in the wings ♫ Take your mark and take a chance ♫ Take a step and dance the dance ♫ With our voices we will sing out ♫ We are waiting we're waiting ♫ Waiting in the wings ♫ No longer waiting ♫ No longer waiting in the wings ♫ So let's stop waiting ♫ Waiting waiting waiting ♫ Waiting in the wings
