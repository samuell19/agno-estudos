DEMIDOVA Vassilchikov - R. YANKOVSKY Officer - R. TKACHUK Follow me! Forward! Onward to Crimea! Onward against Wrangel! Onward to Crimea! Don't spare your boots, infantry! As you were! As you were! Do you have a soldier named Nekrasov? No. What's the gossip in headquarters about the offensive? We don't gossip at headquarters. There was a soldier once, Named Kondrat he was by chance. Being ignorant and rough, Never heard he of the bath. So he's gotten parasites, Those lice that visit sites: Beds and cradles, and make inroads Into soldiers' shirts and coats. There're different kinds of typhus... - Who's the man? An actor? - Our doctor. He makes verses himself. - Is soldier Nekrasov here? - Get out of here. No enemy's so vicious, So dangerous when smites, As those typhus parasites. The letter "A", the former "Az". So we get "ma..." Ma.. mama... mama! - Got it? - Got it. Hey, fellows, is there soldier Nekrasov here? No Nekrasov, we've got only Pushkin. Just look how smart you are. A real professor. Why do they teach you ABC then? Hey, staff man, tell them at HQ that it's time to take an assault. You're out of tune. Once again. Concentrate. - Good morning, Comrade Prikhodko. - Good morning to you. Do you know soldier Nekrasov? Yes, he's in our company. There he is, sitting by Motria's well. - Where? - Over there. - Nekrasov! - What? Nekrasov! What is it? Go to Headquarters this minute. No, I won't let him go. He must first catch up my pail that he dropped. You can go ordering about your borsht and porridge, but not here. Why to Headquarters? They'll explain to you why. Well, let it be to Headquarters. Regiment Headquarters. November 1 , 1920 Dear comrades. What is Crimea in terms of all Russia? Almost nothing. A pimple. I can cover it with my hand, and you won't see it. But that's the way only a completely stupid fool may reason. We're going to reason from a clever point of view. So you, political officers, must understand it yourselves and explain it to every soldier. Crimea is the stronghold of the White vermin now. We've driven them there from all over Russia, lots of officers there. They stand epaulet to epaulet, whole regiments of officers. And they're going to give us a brutal fight, for they have armored cars, airplanes and all kinds of artillery. The entire Soviet Russia is behind us, asking us to crush that snake pit, to tear the poisonous sting out. Now you will ask me how we can crush it with Crimea as inaccessibly fortified as it is? There are the Turkish rampart, the Sivash swamps, ditches, barbed wire fortifications and guns. I don't know. I don't know. But Crimea will be ours! Comrade Commander, soldier Nekrasov's here, on urgent summons. Let him wait. Any questions? Two comrades were serving, yeah. Two comrades were serving In the same regiment. Two comrades were serving In the same regiment. A bullet went a-whistling by, yeah... Hey, buddy, why so little written on your breeches? With so wide an ass, you could stamp everybody in there: the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Answer when you're spoken to, or we'll strip you of your painted pants and bare your shining behind. Nekrasov! To the commander, quick! Made so much smoke, devils. Their tobacco's deadlier than mustard gas. I despise tobacco. I've got a silicosis. But that's only an introduction. Now let's get to the point. You were a photographer before the war, weren't you, Nekrasov? Actually, I was a student. But when they expelled me, I worked as a photographer for two years. It's good, it's just great! Now we'll attach you to your own familiar occupation. Trofimov! Bring that stupid thing in here. Bring it here. There! A war trophy! A "Debrie" camera, and two thousand feet of film to boot. But it is for shooting films. Right. So we'll have now our own film shooting. And I'm appointing you our chief film shooter. No, I can't, Comrade Commander. You need a specialist, I'm not familiar with this equipment. How dare you talk like that? You think I've commanded a regiment all my life? It's them I commanded. A miner's hack was all my equipment. What do you mean you can't? I don't like such people. I said you'll be a shooter, so you'll be a shooter. - About face! - Yes! Wait! Where are you going? You oddball. Cinema is such a great thing! Cinema! Have you seen "Vampire Woman"? And "The Tales of Fatal Love"? You just sit there horror-struck. Or a travel film, for instance: "Poincare's Arrival in Algeria", or "The Coronation of King George". But we are going to shoot something altogether different. I've got... an idea. To film all our Red heroes. Their revolutionary valor and glory. I'm interested in this enterprise from a purely military aspect. You, comrade, are to provide me air reconnaissance for the forthcoming offensive. You will film from an airplane the Whites' fortifications in Perekop. I'll try to. Yes, try to, otherwise you'll be court-martialed. The Army of Whites and its black baron Again try to place the czar on his throne. But from the taiga to the British Seas No one stronger than the Red Army is. - Hi! - Hi. - Are you the shooter? - Yes, I am. And who are you? Ivan Karyakin, son of my own parents. I've been sent here to help you, guard you and keep you company. Well, just giving you a hand, can carry heavy things too. There was such an order. So let's make friends. Let's go. - Is that all our stuff? - Yeah. That's great. I respect this kind of mechanisms very much. You know, I... I'm a man of mechanics, a tinsmith, a worker born and bred. - And what are you coming from? - My origin's not so good... I'm, so to speak, from the clergy. I was brought up by my uncle, a priest. Brought up by a priest? How did you end up in the Red Army? Were you mobilized or what? I volunteered. Strange things do happen: a priest's son fights for the Reds, a peasant fights for Wrangel. Do you know, by the way, that Comrade Lenin comes from the gentry? Don't you dare to smear Comrade Lenin! For such talk I can give it to you!... Mind you, Nekrasov, I was a company commander. I was reduced to the ranks for killing a military specialist traitor, a former colonel, with my own hands. I've gotten a sharp eye for enemies of the revolution, you get it? I get it. Cross-eyed Yermolai got a sharp eye. The only fright, he doesn't see right. I see alright! Sevastopol. November 2, 1920 My dear, please, I beg you... Yulia, come on. Such a big girl doesn't know how to behave. Why a powder keg? General Wrangel guarantees that they won't be able to take Crimea for another twenty years. That's going too far! Twenty! A year, maybe two, or three... A pair of boots - 80 thousand, the shoulder-belt - 20. A trashy tunic is 30 thousand. Where can I get it? I've got no family diamonds. Hands up! - Please. - Please, go away. It's enough, I'm tired of it. And where's my Sasha Brusentsov? Right. Go to him, he's in Room 24. Hands up! Very nice. Oh God, what is it?! - What happened? - Excuse me, Madam. Lieutenant Brusentsov, what's going on here? Who was shooting? Naturally, it was me who was shooting. Someone burst into the room, crying "Hands up!" I had a gun, so I fired. And it was Seryozha Lukashevich, Mironov's aide-de-camp. I didn't recognize him in the dark. The name of the lady, please? What's your name? Ksyusha... Oksana Nesterenko. Do you corroborate the lieutenant's words? Yes, everything was as he says. That man came in with a revolver. So he fired. It was not a revolver, but a cigarette lighter. He wanted to play a joke. It turned out a bad joke. Surrender your gun. You're under house arrest. How is he? There's no pulse. I think he's dead. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Can I go? Go. Can you stay here, nurse, till the doctor comes? Of course, I can. Why are you staring at me like an owl from a hollow? Got nothing to say? I see. Trying to kill the bastard with your contempt. Perhaps you'd better leave. You've done yourjob. Where can I go? I'm under house arrest. People like you have discredited the White cause. They hate us because of your kind. What do you know? Yes, I killed my friend like an idiot. Because it's an idiotic time. Everyone's gone crazy. And you're crazy, too. There's a dead man here, you should pray, not talk about the White cause. All right, let's talk about the White cause. Do you know that neither you, nor me, nor anyone of our people will be here in a month? Oh, what a nasty man you are. And you're willing to believe any nonsense but the truth. You're afraid and you want everyone to be afraid and lose hope. Hope? All of you have only one hope - Crimea. But it will be taken from you, and where will you go? Officers will become janitors, ladies will go on the streets. Present company excluded, of course. Sasha! Congratulations, you're under investigation. Get your things. Such a pity, poor boy. In the prime of his life... Village of Zhukovka. November 3. Stop. Good! - Are you flying with me? - Yes. There was such an order. Pilot! Where shall I sit? In the front or in the rear? In the front. This is my assistant. Assistant. No way, I can take only one cameraman. What do you mean, one? We both are going. I can't take both. Do you know that man? You don't? He won't make a step without me, to say nothing of flying to the Whites. We'll fly together. All right, let's try. Get in. From beyond the wooded island To the river wide and free, Proudly sail the arrow-breasted Ships of Cossack yeomanry. Look, a White! He dares to threaten us. It's Perekop. Lower! - Lower! - Lower we go! Still lower! The ball is over. My ball is over, too. The engine's stalled. Why? Then fix it. I said, fix it! Can you swim? And I swim like an axe with no handle. Perhaps we can make it back? That's how we made it... What a bad luck. No more flying for our aviator. - Are they without shoulder straps? - Yeah. They're ours. They're ours. Hey! They're ours, Andrei! Ours! Wait! What are you scared of? I said that... Give me your gun! Are you crazy, guys? I told you we're of your own. Our own are crawling down our back. Arrest them, boys. Here, two more. So who are you, people? Where did you come from? They're spies. Didn't I explain it to you? We're Red soldiers, were flying on a reconnaissance mission. Show your documents. We didn't take them with us. We were on a reconnaissance mission. Very interesting birds you are. You say you're the Reds, but you came from the Whites. Savchuk, let me see what they got there, what kind of ammunition? Don't touch it! What are you doing? If it explodes, everyone will be blown to pieces. Wait, Savchuk, don't touch it. Lock them up. What do you mean, lock them up? I told you, we're Red soldiers. - And what are you, by the way? - What are we? We're the Rebel Army, the defenders of the oppressed peasantry. Is it clear now what we are? The rebel army. Or simply the Makhnovists. Look, answer me what right do you have to keep us here? We're allies, aren't we? Maybe we're allies. Or maybe not. Now look! How can it be? No one can believe the Bolsheviks. You've sold out the revolution. What a dolt you are. You blockhead! To whom we have sold it? Tell me, to whom? How do I know? You've sold it to whomever needs it. - I think they'll knock us off. - They can't knock us off. Makhno's our ally. We've been read the order. Maybe they didn't read it to him. Guard! How can they knock us off? Guard! Damn you... - What do you want? - I need to go the john. - What? - Nature's call. Come on. Go on. - What did they do? - Judged by the revolutionary court. They fled from Wrangel to the Red Army, just like you. And we killed them. Those Wrangel men had such a fine garb... - You got it all? - No such luck. Come on, comrade, do your thing. Come on, go to yourjohn. Semyon! Come here, Semyon. Look. - What? - Look. Well? If you've shown me sausage, bacon or dumplings with sour cream... This stuff I've seen plenty. Gritsko, come here. What are you doing there so long? Did you swallow the rope or what? Come out and go back to the house. You're back. I hoped you've run away. You're a big boy, but got no zest. Two officers wanted to defect to the Reds from Wrangel, but those Makhnovists have shot them anyway, and they'll shoot us too. Bastards. Listen to me. There're three machine-gun carts outside. One has a "Maxim" with a cartridge belt. It will do alright. But how are we to get out. The cart's there and we're here. There must be a cellar here. Guard! Guard! Guard! What's up? You're giving me no peace. Where're you? Where're they? Hey, guys, stop playing tricks! Guys! Run to the cart and grab the reins. I'll go to headquarters and get the camera. - Where? - I'll get the camera. On the floor, bastards! That's the end of you, get down! Hey, have you seen Panasyuk? Catch them! They'll get away! Halt! Stop them! Get them, boys! Faster! Come on! Faster! Gee up! Gee up, my dears! Come on, Vanya! Push it up! Whoa, my darlings! To tell the truth, I took no liking to you at first. But I can say now that you're a heroic man of proletarian conduct. So it means that nothing can part you and me now. And for my initial rudeness, so to speak, I can even ask your forgiveness, that's what kind of a man I am. Oh, I'm starving for some grub. Wouldn't it be nice to have potatoes? We have such good potatoes in Tula! They're so white and soft, you just mash them with a spoon, pour sunflower oil on them, and they're so delicious. What do you think about when hungry? About meat. And I think about different things. I just have to imagine what an interesting life lies ahead, and I feel a lot better. In ten years there will be no hungry people. Believe me. Maybe only those who've overeaten, will be put on a diet. And since there will be no hungry people... There will be no spite, stealing or other ugly things. All those prisons we will close, of course. Maybe we'll leave one. For the world counter-revolutionary slime. And all the others will be scrapped. There will be no one to put in there. There'll always be someone. So you doubt it? Yes. Sure, we can give people food, but to fix their brains right, it will take more than ten years, perhaps even more than twenty. What a joyless man you are, and very harmful too. You can't live without spitting in every saucepan. Gee up, Makhno's breed! A bullet went a-whistling by, yeah. A bullet went a-whistling by, yeah. A bullet went a-whistling by, And my comrade fell to the ground... Stop spreading gloom. Don't you know any good songs? Kulminsh! I wonder what unit is stationed here? Makes no difference. There're ours all around. You smell it? They're cooking porridge. We're just in time. Comrade Commissar. We detained two suspicious persons. Who are you? We've explained it three times already. We're the fighters of the 61st Division. On our commander's order, we were making an air reconnaissance. And where's your airplane? Our airplane had crashed. And the Makhnovists burned it. And we came on a machine-gun cart. Don't talk so much. Debrie. Paris, France. A French camera. Your documents? Well, naturally, we didn't take the documents with us. We were flying over the Whites' territory. Had they caught us... I'm Karyakin. We were flying over the Whites' territory... Wait, don't talk so much. You don't look like a Red Army fighter. I advise you to tell the truth: who you are and why you're here. We're telling you in Russian... Wait, I've recognized you. You were torturing me in your counter- intelligence. You're a White officer. - You're mistaken. - Your hands are covered with blood. Comrade Commissar. This is what we found in their cart. It's clear now. Shoot them. Shoot us again! Isn't it one time too many?! Don't listen to that witch, brothers! - Take us to a male commander. - Wait! Let's talk and sort everything out. What is there to talk about? You got caught. Have courage to die like men. Go down, will you. Go down... What's the hurry? And we were rushing here like idiots. Just had the horses overridden. We might as well have been killed by the Makhnovists. Remember, Ivan, you told me how you'd shot a military specialist? Perhaps you were wrong then too, like this madam here? Stop it, that was quite a different situation, nothing like this. In the name of the Revolution, death to the White spies! Commissar Nifontova. - At the White spies... - Wait, guys! What? Let me have a smoke before dying. - What's on your mind? - You hear it? A car. Come here. Let me enjoy my last smoke. Hey, wait! Wait! Wait! Nekrasov? Comrade Chief of Staff! Your order has been carried out... Carried out. What are you doing here? They're shooting us. Yes, shooting us. I'm the regiment's chief of staff. The shooting's being put off! What? We got nothing against it. Neither do we. Sevastopol. November, 4 Hey, on the boat! Hi, boatswain. Blow your horn, line up your crew, the admiral's on board. That's you? An incredibly silly question. More silly may be only the answer to it. And nevertheless, yes, it's me. How did you find me? I kept asking everybody where the most beautiful nurse lives. - By the way, what's your name? - Sasha. Very nice, so we're namesakes. My name is Sasha, too. It's not so great a dwelling you've got here. What can we do? It's impossible to find a room in the city. Alexandra Yevgenyevna, I've got rice. Do you think it's enough for porridge? Yes, rice increases in volume when boiled. - Then I'm inviting you for supper. - Thank you. Is that my rival? I won't tolerate it. The law of the sea is uncompromising: a brick to the neck and in the water. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? He's a charming old man. A noble and very unhappy man. Let's forget about him. As though we're very happy. I came here right from the guardhouse. The bedbugs there are real vampires. You don't look very happy either, or am I mistaken? They let you out for good? Yes, for good. I was found not guilty. Yes. I've brought something. Coffee, sugar... and this. I've got no bread. We'll get by. So you thought you'd come here and we'd drink vodka, right? And what if I was not alone, what if I had a husband or a lover? Why this silly talk? You got no husband, nor a lover. Brusentsov! I just wanted you to be alone and happy to see me. I wanted us to sit here and talk. Am I to blame for that? Sasha! Brusentsov! What's the matter? I thought I'd never find you. Sasha, something came up. General Brilling took your Abrek. What right did he have to do that? They say you're not a cavalryman, nor an aide-de-camp, so you don't need a horse. Very nice. Never mind, I'll teach him a lesson. You want Abrek? Try and take him! He's been with me since 1916! Stand back! Scoundrels! Beasts! Out of my way, you rear-guard rats! I won't give him! I'll shoot everyone! Arrest the son of a bitch! Send him to the front! Regiment Headquarters. November 6 I wonder what are we going to be awarded with? If with personal guns, I don't need it. I would like box-calf boots, and a pair of breeches for you. Why are you so gloomy, Andrei? Lighten up! - Shall I shut it? - Yeah. Shut it up! Go ahead. Is that all? Yes, that's all. Well, I couldn't do it. And those people, who were they? Well... They have nothing to do with it. I don't get it, Nekrasov. Can you explain it to me? Were you filming or not? I was. Maybe it's been exposed or the wrong focus. Focus?! I knew about that focus-pocus of his. Comrade Regiment Commander, may I speak? Nekrasov is a non-party man of alien origin. He spoke against the revolution and he intentionally spoiled the film. How're we going to take the offensive now? He let down the whole division. My heart has always been against you. Why don't you say something, a priest's breed? You see? Cut it out, Ivan. That's much too much. Let's not do anything rash. I say what I think. We all learn from our mistakes. All right, you can go, Nekrasov. We've got a lot to do... without you. Comrade Commander, do you want me to draw the Perekop fortifications? What? I've got a good visual memory. I never forget a thing if I see it. Draw it. May I have a pencil? These are the gun pockets. These are the guns. And here they have four cannons without wheels. The sea guns. It seems like this. Seems is just wishful thinking. We need it exactly. And here are the barbed-wire barriers. We got here some information from the deserters. A detailed description of 2 sectors. Let's compare it with your scrawls. Amazing! Just to a T. Well, Nekrasov... You snake! Now we'll send this information to the army headquarters. Really, a phenomenal memory! Come here, boys, help me to the horse. Why didn't you call me? It's nothing. Good. You're pure gold, boy. Let me give you a kiss. Here, to remember my generous heart. - Andrei, let me see your Mauser. - Get out of here. Are you pissed off? You shouldn't be, really. I thought you were the enemy of the revolution. So I got hot. - Now I see I made a mistake. - A mistake... It's not a mistake. It's called a betrayal. No, it's not. I said it right into your face. Not behind your back. And it will always be like that, you can be sure. So let's be friends again. - What do you say? - Get lost! Comrade Regiment Commander, to whom shall I hand this... equipment over? You're too fast, boy... hand over... And who's going to roll the film for me? Tomorrow's our holiday, there'll be a parade, so keep rolling that thing. You'll return that mechanics to me after the war is over. Is it clear? Yes, it's clear. Division HQ. November 7, 1920 - Good morning, Comrade Commanders. - Good morning. Sit down. According to the order prepared by Comrade Frunze and approved by the Chief Commander, we start the offensive today, no later than 24:00. Our army is to storm the Turkish rampart and break through the Whites' fortifications. We'll enter Crimea on the enemy's shoulders. The latest intelligence data confirm that the Whites' defensive positions in Perekop are all but inaccessible. Therefore, the Command decided to force the putrid Lake Sivash, come out onto the Litovsky Peninsula and attack the Whites in the rear. Hold it. - How does it look? - Tighten it up a bit. Hail the 3rd anniversary of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolution! Hey, photographer, get my personality on film! Sivash. November 8, 00 hours 30 minutes No smoking! No smoking! Turkish Rampart. November 8, 03 hours 00 minutes - May I come in? - Come in. Lieutenant Brusentsov. Pleased to meet you. Colonel, we're sitting and waiting here for a frontal attack. But what if the Reds take a detour? It's the ABC of warfare, and they know it. Yes, you're right, Lieutenant. We know they're planning a turning maneuver in the Chingar direction. No, I don't mean that. What if they go through Sivash? Right through the sea? You're out of your mind. Perhaps. But what if they're out of their mind too? Did you think of that possibility? - When did you arrive? - Half an hour ago. Then go wash up and take a rest. What can I do when every lieutenant thinks he's Bonaparte, or Prince of Savoy, but there's nobody to fight? Baron! Connect me to Litovsky. Litovsky? Who's speaking? Gubarevich? It's me, Vassilchikov. Are your search lights working? Direct them onto Sivash, just in case. What? I'm telling you, just in case! Litovsky Peninsula. November 8, 03 hours 40 minutes Pankov! Pankov! They call and call with clever ideas. They don't know what they want. Yes, your Honour. Switch them over to close observation. We'll look onto Sivash. We'll look, we'll look... - When will we be relieved? - Soon, soon... Turn on search lights! Karyakin, the commander's been killed. Third company! Listen to my command! Follow me! Follow me! Follow me! Company! Company! Company! Hold on this position! Hold on this position! Hold on this position! Hold on this position! Nekrasov! Nekrasov, come here! Nekrasov, come here! I need to talk to you. They'll attack in the morning and there're so few of us left. You said you have a phenomenal memory. Can you find your way back to ours? - I don't know. - You must help us out. Go and report that the Red heroes are in a big trouble. They're wet and miserable, waiting for their end. We need reinforcement. I'll give you men and wire to stretch a telephone line. Will you do it? - I'll try to. - Go ahead. Go, be so kind. Drop that thing! Drop it, I said! Drop it, or it'll drag you down to the bottom! Paramoshkin, take your unit and go with Nekrasov. Hey, you! Who are you and where from? I'm Nekrasov from Litovsky. No, we're alive and kicking still. Comrades! Listen to me here! There'll be no rejoicing for the White vermin! We'll die today. They'll die tomorrow. Because the revolution will win! It will win even if we die! Fire! Hey! Where's the reinforcement? Division Headquarters. November 8, 15 hours 00 minutes There's a fierce fighting going on now on the Litovsky Peninsula. The remaining assault columns and the cavalry to support them are fighting their way into the peninsula's inland. But if the Whites withdraw part of their forces from the Turkish rampart and transfer them to Litovsky, our men will not hold out. Therefore, we have to divert the enemy's forces onto ourselves. And to do that, we need a frontal blow on the Turkish rampart. Turkish Rampart. November 8, 1 7 hours 00 minutes Fire! Fire! Hurry! Hurry! Bastards! Fire! Fire! Onward! Rout Wrangel! We've thrashed them alright. Too early to rejoice, you fool. Brusentsov, to the Colonel! May I come in? Lieutenant... Last night the Reds have forced Sivash. Who could have ever guessed it? Stop it. They're debating now in headquarters whether we should transfer forces from here to the Litovsky Peninsula. It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul. We'll send them reinforcement, patch it up there only to bare our ass here. One more storming, and we'll be knocked out of here. On the other hand, to keep all our forces here is also... stupid. They'll get to our backdoor through Litovsky. Of course, we have to retreat to Yushun while it's not too late. - Are they sleeping or what? - If so, it's a very sound sleep. They've all fled. Come on, guys, quick! Move it, whoever is alive. Andrei? You here? Me here, too! Surrender, you son of a bitch. How are you, Andrei, my dear friend? How were you doing without me? As you can see, still alive. So you're a commander now? A commander over what?... They've killed all my troop. I'm with you again from now on. We'll be inseparable, like two fingers of one hand. Well... If you don't mind. Yushun. November 10 Surrender! You can't get away! Dzhankoi. November 1 1 Wait, give me the binoculars. A bullet went a-whistling by, and yes. A bullet went a-whistling by, And my comrade fell to the ground... Stop that bitchy song. It'll bring bad luck to me. Do I hear a politically conscious soldier talking? Stop singing it anyway. I've told you not to time and again. Ready. It's good. Now let me shoot you. A bullet went a-whistling by, and yes... You see, it's stuck to me. Andrei, mount it and take the saber and the binocular. - It'll do as it is. - All right. Smile! Ready! They say there're some berries growing here, called grapes. - Have you ever eaten them? - I've tried them. And I had no such luck. - Do they make you feel full? - So-so... - What is it? - I'm going to liquidate that bastard. Are you crazy? Not crazy. See that one in the front? See how he's walking? It's not a peasant's walk. One hand is swinging and the other's like nailed to his side. I can see he's an officer, used to hold his saber back. He got away, bastard. Abrek, Abrek... Oh, my God! Oh, my God... - Hurry up, Comrade Krause. - Stop your silly jokes. Jokes? Get used to it, Comrade Baron. We're on the Red territory, in the Land of Soviets. Comrade Baron von der Krause. What do you need that for? I've got the last bullet in it, saving it for myself. Good for you. What is the telegraphic sight for? So that you won't miss? Oh, Comrade Krause, Comrade Krause... Don't worry, the Reds won't grudge you a bullet. What's on your mind? I don't want to that bullet go to waste. Alexander Nikitich, don't do it. Get away, you fool. Let me kill at least one in the end. Alexander Nikitich, that'll be the end of us. Andrei! Andrei... Andrei... Are you alive? Do you hear me?... I'm bleeding, it's heavy... I'll get you to the infirmary. The blood's heavy, you can't hold it back... Why not? What do you mean? I'll hold it back, I will! Hold on, Andrei, hold on... Hey! Hey, guys!
