You did a good job! - Alright, go home! - Yes, father. Mi. Your husband is with those whores over there. You're his first wife, you should be the one worrying. Don't push your worry over to me. Mi, we should go home and have some wine. There's wine in the kitchen. It's Tet (Vietnamese Lunar New Year), why don't you have some wine? Are you afraid of your husband beating you? A-Su, that old ball and chain of yours is watching you play around with other girls. It's her. Where? Where? It's Tet. Why don't you have some wine? It's Tet.

Only I can play with these girls! Brothers, they want to mess with us! A-Phu! A-Phu! A-Phu! - A-Phu! - What's up A-Sinh? Those scumbags want us to leave, so that they can play with our girls. - You want to die here? - It's him! You're the Lord's son? Now that you know who I am, kneel down and I will forgive you. You're just a pile of goat shit. I'm the biggest white tiger of the jungle. It's you who has to kneel down and beg for my forgiveness. How dare you insult me! Beg me for forgiveness. Enough! Break it off! Who are you? Who gave you the balls to beat the Lord's son? He hit me, I hit him back. That's just self-defense. It's him who wanted to kill all of us. Tie him up. The rest of you can fuck off. Do you want to die? Fuck off! Mi! Mi! Mi! The Lord said that you should get some ointment to heal your husband's wound. - Go bring the other officials here for me! - Yes, sir. Kneel there. Kneel! Beat him to his death! More! Beat him more! Have another smoke. Don't worry, the accused will have to pay for all of this. Good! Keep hitting him! Hey, the Lord asked you to give him more. Wake up! Wake up! Get me my medicine! Beat him to his death! Come here. Secretary. What are his charges? A-Phu. To not be killed, you have to... compensate the victim... 20 Vietnamese dong... and pay the Lord... 20 dong. Good, keep going! Each deputy... will get 2 dong. As the secretary, I will get 1 dong. You will have to pay for the opium for the Lords dealing with your case. You have to pay for a 20-kilogram pig. A pig to be slaughtered for the party of the Lords. A-Phu! You deserve the death sentence. But the Lord has sympathy because of your dead parents. They've gone, leaving you with nothing. So the Lord will lend you the money. You'll work as his slave, to pay off the debt. You'll be free when you pay off the debt. Until then, you will be a buffalo, a horse, serving Lord Pa Tra. You, your children, and their children after them, will have to work to pay off Lord Pa Tra. A-Phu, the deputies are gathered here to witness your case. A-Phu, go take the money that Lord Pa Tra lends you. A-Phu, go take the money that Lord Pa Tra lends you. A-Phu! Come help us! A-Phu! Help us get rid of this log so that we can plow the soil later. - Come on! - Move aside. Let's give him a hand. A-Phu. Some girl said that you're like a deer in the forest. Why's that? Because he doesn't have any money and he doesn't have any rings either. Only one wanting to live a rat's life would be willing to love you, A-Phu. Well, there's one! Don't say something like that! A-Phu is as strong as 4 buffaloes put together. Indeed he is! Who dares to show me her love for A-Phu? A-Phu. Has anyone listened to your pipe and come out here with you? You have! Mi! I'm going to herd the cows and horses to the meadow. I'll be back at noon to plow the soil. Be back soon! Don't oversleep, or tigers will get the horses. The sun is setting Your hands are used to sewing shirts I love you, you love me I'll give up if you don't love me If you do, please come stay with me We can spend a night together How could he not be back here already? Mi? You're hoping for A-Phu. How come I've never seen you hoping for your husband? Do you want to play in the forest with A-Phu? Do you want to get me killed? Why are you so mean? If A-Phu was killed by tigers, would you feel sorrow for him? You sure would. When I was young, and beautiful, your husband still had love for me... but I've never loved him. I'm... just like you, I hate him. We'd be dead if someone heard us. Mi! Tigers have gotten a horse. Have you searched already? Go herd the cows and horses back for me. I'll come after the tigers now. Don't tell them that I didn't come back on time, and don't tell them that I've lost a horse. Please help me. Please help me. Damn! Your husband is going to kill A-Phu. My God! Having stayed in this family for 10 years... I wouldn't find it strange if the Lord killed someone over a lost horse. A-Phu! A-Phu! *echo* A-Phu A-Phu! *echo* A-Phu! A-Phu! *echo* A-Phu! A-Phu. Where are you going, Mi? A-Su is going to kill you over that lost horse. A-Phu, go hide somewhere. What's that, A-Phu? The remains of the horse. It's a big tiger. Its footprints are right around here. You should come get a gun to kill it. A tiger is equal to a herd of horses. That will help you. I won't be punished if I kill the tiger? I can't go back there. Just come back. You don't have to hide! Don't do it. Is it true that the Lord will forgive me if I kill the tiger? The tiger will be your compensation for the horse. Don't worry. Come back, A-Phu. Don't hide anymore. Come with me. You brought my horse to the Viet Minh? No, sir. The tiger ate it. Please give me a gun, I will kill it. The tiger is so big. It's still around here. You thief. You're not going anywhere. Stay here. You're deep in sins now. This time, I'll have you tied to the post. Only after my men kill the tiger can you be released. Tell A-Su and his men to get the tiger for me. Yes, sir. Why don't you let me go? A tiger is worth much more than the horse I lost. Please, let me go. Get me the cuffs! Tie him to the post! What's that, Lord Pa Tra? My servant has lost my horse to a tiger. You have to be careful. He might plan to give the horse to the Viet Minh. If they can't kill the tiger, that will mean death for you. The French Army are coming up here to build the Hong Ngai outpost, before the rainy season. The Viet Minh is here. Did you know about this? I need more laborers from you. You don't want to contribute anything to the outpost? I'll fuck you up, Viet Minh! Bunch of gooks! You want to beat the crap out of us French people, eh? You thugs! Fat chance! Hey! You, work! You dirty towelhead! Hey, you! Aren't you working? I can eat them, they are nothing serious... Just chicken guts! Don't break this one, Louis, we still need him. ??? Hey, see, I can mess around too. I will show you! Come on, you over there! Work! You cunts! And you, you don't work, huh? Work! Quickly, quickly! What is it? Lord, I've brought more laborers to help build faster. Good, get out of here. Come on, you have to ask someone over there. Bunch of bastards! Sinh It's okay now. Let's get down. It's so cold. We've run out of food, yet we still have to work non-stop. We'll die soon. If we continue like this our wives and children back home will starve to death. Then... We should try to escape. They won't let us escape. They can't capture us back. If we're all in this together, they can't stop us. - Just leave! - Right! What are you doing? Return to your work! We're hungry. There's nothing to eat. We can't work like this. - Why did you hit him? - Guards! Arrest these two! What? Why are you here? Why aren't you at the outpost? I've arrested two men. They were trying to lead an escape. They're not locals. They're Viet Minh. I've brought them back here. Right! Inform the French. Bring them in. I have a way to deal with them. But don't scare them off. Don't be afraid. Make yourselves at home. Come to the kitchen, it's warmer there. I'll tell my men to fix you a place to rest. If you want to leave, we'll let you leave. Sinh! There's a man tied up in the house. He's guilty of something. Look! I know this man! What's up, A-Phu? Sinh? A-Phu, what got you into this? Brothers, you're about to end up like me. Sinh, A-Su is going to inform the French. We know. He's afraid that you brought soldiers here with you. He pretended to not know about it. He's holding you here for the French. A-Phu! Stay calm! Don't worry! We have our soldiers and guerrillas stationed in Phieng Sa. Neither Lords nor Frenchmen are there. - Where? - In Phieng Sa. Not far from here. Phieng Sa. Phieng Sa. Look! We're dead! Bring these two men downstairs. Feed them and bed them. Let them go in the morning. Mi! Please, get me some water. What to do? How can I do it? Am I going to spend my life like this, until I die? Stand up, or sit back? Hurry! Hurry, A-Phu! A-Phu. Go now! Go now! A-Phu, let me go with you. *Soldiers shouting* Get in there! I was riding with the soldiers when I found out that the two prisoners had escaped... The two Viet Minh men escaped! The two Viet Minh men escaped? They can't be far. Untie A-Phu, let him lead the soldiers to hunt down the prisoners. Where's A-Phu? Mi is gone, too! Where did they go, you useless bitch? Tie her to the post. She will die for their sin! Get over there! You, go there! Follow me! Where's the torch? Where's the torch? Hurry! Follow me, men! Phieng Sa is on the other side of the river. Us Miao (Hmong) people don't know how to swim. I can't cross the river. But we haven't gotten to Phieng Sa yet. We have to reach Phieng Sa. Our suffering will end there. Let's go!

I'm reaching happiness now... but without her. Then we'll have to go find her. Can we do it? We're guerillas. We can go anywhere. We're not scared of anything. - What's up, A-Su? - I'm lucky to get back alive. Mi couldn't escape. Her life is full of suffering. She thinks she will never escape that hell. Mi, come rub my feet. Have you seen that old man Lau? Someone shot out my eye, I can't see anyone. He has really escaped? The French general is waiting for you. What now? The French general said the Viet Minh was about to attack us. We have to kill all the guerrillas, to stop them from joining the Viet Minh. We can't. Why? Our troops have all gone rogue. We can't fight. We have to fight. Fight what? The French general said we have to attack Phieng Sa. Phieng Sa. Phieng Sa. Is A-Phu dead, or still alive? Hi A-Sinh, hi A-Phu. Hi A-Phu, how are you? Hi, A-Sinh, A-Phu. Hi, A-Phu. Sinh. We haven't seen anyone from Hong Ngai village. I'm worried about it too. Hong Ngai has just been scorched by the French. But they will get here eventually. You know me well, Sinh. If I had 10 fathers and 10 mothers they wouldn't be as happy as I am now. But I can't keep this happiness to myself. I know the way back to Hong Ngai. Let me go back there and rescue my wife. I'm worried for her. Please, let me go comrade. Alright. We'll talk about it with A-Chau! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! I've brought the big guns. Hey! It's A-Chau! My comrades! I have good news for all of my comrades! Our comrades have just marched into and liberated Tay Bac. They have crossed the river Da. The longing for the happiness of the liberation of our people, for all ethnic groups, has now been realized For the last 4 years, our guerrillas... have fought hard against the enemy How much of value have we sacrificed? How many lives have been lost? To protect this land. To protect the faith in the Party, till Liberation Day comes. Now! You have to go back. Get in position. First, prepare food and supplies for our troops. Second, give directions and co-ordinate with our troops to combat the enemy. Third, spread this good news to everyone, of every ethnic group, that our troops have now marched in to liberate Tay Bac. A-Phu, let's go talk to him, and ask him to let us help liberate Hong Ngai. A-Chau, am I allowed to fight in Hong Ngai with the troops? Higher! Higher! A-Phu! Gather our troops in the village and wait for the signal. Go now! Let me! Fire! To the right. To this side! You've got a phone call, sir. Hello, Chief of Hong Ngai outpost speaking. What? We can't continue fighting without reinforcements. Colonel! I can't accept that. The Viet Minh is attacking us hard! Hello? Hello? Goddamn it! What's up? What's up, A-Su? The Frenchmen are gone. The Frenchmen are gone? Lord Pa Tra, rest assured. I'm prepared. My troops are stationed outside. What did you say? We'll fight again? No! We are going to escape to Laos. We will come back when the coast is clear. We'll wipe out the Viet Minh, and reclaim Tay Bac. You heard me, Lord Pa Tra? We are coming with you? Yes, we have to go now! Can you let my people come along? No! This must be a secret. But they have heard our plan. If so... Let this one, this one, and this one come along. Understood, A-Su? The General is taking you to Laos? He wants you for his own. I can't let that happen. No! You... You are our slave. We have fed you. Do you understand? You are our slave. Our slave will die in our house! You can only die in our house. Lord Pa Tra, what's the matter? You don't want to go to Laos? A-Su! You're trying to kill my wife, again? The End
