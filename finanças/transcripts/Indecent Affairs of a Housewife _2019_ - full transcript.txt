[SEXY SIGH] [MUSIC PLAYING] Kathy, we're going to be late. KATHY: You want me to look good for you, don't you? Please wear something sexy. KATHY: What was that? I said we were supposed to be there by 6:00. KATHY: All ready. Let's go. Well? Well, what? How does it look? How does what look? The dress, silly. I just got it today. JIM: Oh, great. It looks great. KATHY: It better. It cost me $200. What? For that thing? Well, it's-- it's handmade. By Amish handmaidens? No, it was made in Utah. JIM: Well, that explains it. They spent $200 on all that fabric. What's that supposed to mean? You could make five dresses out of all that. It leaves everything to the imagination. What? It's not attractive? It's fine. Come on, dear, we got to go. No, wait. You don't find me attractive in this dress? JIM: I think that you're the most beautiful woman on the face of this planet. Really? Really. But if I was Adam and you were Eve in that dress, the apple would be very safe. But the old lady at the boutique said it was pretty. Bingo. JIM: Oh, did you see Bill? The guy has no tact. When he started talking about the Joneses, I just about died laughing. And then Susie, she really made a scene, huh? What's wrong? Are you OK? What do you think about Melissa? Well, she's nice. I spoke to her a lot tonight. Oh really? About what. You think she's pretty. Sure, everyone does. But it doesn't mean anything. Well, she flaunted it enough. JIM: She didn't flaunt at all. She was dressed very sexy. Well, then take her to the next party. What's wrong with you? What you talking about? Nothing, just forget it. Come on, what is it? Well, everybody was coming up and telling her how great she looked. So? I was standing right next to her. Oh, well. She dresses very sexy. It gets a lot of attention. Oh, so if I wore my underwear instead of a dress, I'd be noticed, too? It wasn't underwear. Was just a very nice outfit. You should try it sometime. SANDY: So, how was the party last night? KATHY: OK, I guess. OK? Thought it was supposed to be the social event of the year. Sandy, do I dress sexy? What? What kind of question is that? Be honest. Of course not. What? Well, you wanted me to be honest. I don't dress sexy ever? Hm. Let's see. All right. Maybe. Not. Let's just face it, you're very conservative. No, I'm not. Oh, what's this? Oh, I think there's hope for you yet. That's not mine. Oops. There must be a mistake. Maybe he got it for you as a gift. I don't have anything like this. Then whose could it be? There must be a good explanation for this. Right. Like maybe you got it mixed up at the laundromat or something. I do my laundry here. Oh. Right. Well, maybe Jim's a cross-dresser. Oh, OK. Gee. Look at the time. I have to do some laundry. See you. Why don't you just tell her? Get it over with. In time. I got to be careful about it. I wouldn't. I'd just lay it on the line. I got some years invested in Kathy, Carl. I don't want to blow it. I wouldn't put up with it. You wouldn't put up with anything. That's why you're still single. I'm just saying there's plenty of fish, that's all. Hey, guys. Jim, we still getting together tonight? Tonight? What's going on tonight? Oh, nothing. Just some extra work project. Yeah, I'll take care of that tonight. OK. Get what done? Do Melissa? It's not what you think, man. Or you hope it's what I think. She's helping me out with Kathy. How is that helping you out? I mean for your libido, I mean. It isn't like that. Hey, man, your secret's safe with me. For $20. RECEPTIONIST (ON PHONE): You sent for a temp secretary. Come on in. Mr. Marriott. I presume you're experienced in these kind of matters? Yes, sir. OK, then have a seat at the receptions desk and all calls to be screened first. Yes, sir. All right. Anything else, it'll come later. Yes, sir. How was practice going for a tournament? It's her last hand. Why don't you just sit here watch my moves. Yep, last hand. Two to two. Well, in that case, then let's play a man's game. Five card stud, winner takes all, you and me. Pitch them, pretty boy. You don't have the card. Oh, really? Then let's up the stakes on that. With what, our clothes? Nope. Mike's clothes. Yep. Good morning Mr. Marelli. Morning. Oh, uh, call Mr. Wellington and tell him that the plans with Radell has been pushed back till Wednesday. Lunch plans? What? Do want to arrange a meeting for lunch plans with the Syntex industry reps? Oh, wow, forgot all about that. Uh, make reservations at Bistro West. They'd like that place. They're at 12:45, Mr. Marriott. What is? Your reservations. I've already made them for you. Oh, wow, great. How did you know I like that place? Oh, well, for the past six months your schedule has shown 12 different meetings with various clients, three with Syntex Industries, all at Bistro Best. And all at? 12:45. Wow. Great, thanks. You win, you get to change places with Mike. And if you win? You drop out of the tournament. You're bluffing. Oh, really? Then call my bluff. I fold. Thought so. So what did you have? Ace of hearts. I had a straight. I win. And so does Mike. Have fun, you two. I'll see you at the tournament. OK, yeah, good. So we'll get those contracts in tomorrow, OK? Good. Could you bring in those papers I was working-- Here's the merger papers you're about to ask for. Wow, thank you. You know, I have a name. Congratulations. You have a name. It's Carol. Carol. Yeah. I knew that. Then why haven't you said it since I started? I guess I really didn't feel the need. Why not? You know, Carol, if you'd like the trend to continue, I'm sure we can arrange that. [LAUGHTER] That's not the normal reaction I get when I threaten to fire someone. You won't fire me. And what makes sure of that? CAROL: Because I'm better than the rest. This could be fun. MIKE: Pick a mask. Choose one. What's this? MIKE: Cannibal juice. Invented it myself. It has about 15 ingredients in it. Like what? I don't know. I change it every time. Wow. MIKE: That's a natural reflex. Most people spit out the first mouthful. They said I have to put my mask on. I found my partner. Partner? Are you ready? For what? For this. Have fun, ladies. Hey, you. Hey, how's the temp assignment going for you? Something's up about this girlfriend of Jack Marriott's. She doesn't seem quite right. What's Marriott do, anyway? He's big player, he buys, sells companies. They take a struggling company, buy it, fix it up, and then they sell it to bigger corporations. So he's like a used company salesman? So, how long has the girl been in the picture? Six months. And I don't think she's around for his charm. Is she a gold digger? I don't think so, she comes from big money. Well, then, let's find out. What are you looking for? Well, I'm just going through records. I'm looking up the financial news. Anything pertaining to recent Marriott dealings. Do you think she could be a mole? Yeah. But how to convince Jeff? Bring out the heavy artillery. Don't be surprised if I get fired very soon. Well, isn't that what we specialize in? No, I mean I didn't-- I understand. No, I don't do this. Do what? This. Yes you do. Jim. Oh, Jim. What? Rough night at the office? Rough. I hardly even heard you come in last night. New project? Project. I found something in the laundry. Oh, did you? And it isn't mine. Laundry? Yes, and the tags are still on it. How did they get in the laundry? So you do know about this. You weren't supposed to see that. You are holding a secret from me. It isn't what you think. Oh, it isn't? And what do I think? I think I know what you're thinking. And it isn't what you should be thinking. I think so. I think that we've used the word think too much. Who is she? I'm not sleeping with anyone. I never said you were. But you were thinking it. I'm sure there's a perfect explanation for this. Yes, there is. And? I bought it. Oh my god. Jim, are you a cross-dresser? What? Of course not. Thank god, it is just another woman. It isn't. Then why'd you buy it? I bought it for you. OK? I'm sorry. Why didn't you give it to me? The receipt said 30 days ago. Receipt? How'd you find the receipt? The store keeps a copy. You went to the store? I thought you were a cross-dresser. What makes you think that? Sandy. Oh, brother. Well, of course. She coming over today? No, I sent her to your office. What? My office? Why? To look for your stash of girly clothes that you were wearing. Jeffery, is that you? JEFFERY: I'm sorry, I only do sessions by appointment. There's another studio down the way, if you some help. It's me. JEFFERY: Brit? Is that you? You look very grown up. You look just like I remember you. BRIT: Great, 12 years old with ponytails. No, you look-- you look beautiful. Thank you. That's very kind. Look, I thought about it and thought about it, but I didn't give it to you. KATHY: Why? I didn't want you to get mad at me. Where are you going? The office. It's Saturday. I have to go hide the stash of bras that I wear all day. Gentlemen. Excuse me. Gentlemen and ladies. Seems you have me in a bit of a bad situation. I'd reckon that'd be so, Dirk. Like Pa always said, when the milk ran dry, time to move to another cow. Right. Well, seems I have no choice. I think I can squeeze this cow just a little bit more, Tex. He's bluffing, Mike. Tex. The name's Tex, Benny. Right. Look, there's no way you got the card in the hole. Maybe. Mike-- I mean Tex-- here has two of the aces in the deck, and I got one here. And I got two of the sixes you'd need to make a straight flush. Then see my bet and go home a wealthy man. My pa always said, it's better to go home with a dollar than nothing. So, that just leaves you and me. Well, tough guy. Or girl. You in or out? Well, we know Mike-- I mean Tex, here, didn't have your card. And neither do you, otherwise you'd be putting your chips in right about now, wouldn't you? Right. Damn. I got to know. You got to pay to see my hand. MIKE: You know, my pa always said-- Mike. Mike. Sorry. It's a three. I figured you were bluffing, but I wasn't sure. Oh, I'm glad it worked. You're totally ready for the tournament. You think? Really? Oh, yeah. I thought you had it. Now you couldn't read any emotion off my face, could you? None. I had no idea. When is the tournament? This weekend. Well, maybe I should sign up. What? Well, Tex, you'd better just give me the entrance fee now and save yourself the trip. I can play cards. Sure you can. You just can't win at cards. I win sometimes. Yeah, well, we let you so you keep coming back. All right? You read like an open book, Tex. I do? OK, Mike, whenever you have more than a pair, you start shaking your leg. Yeah, and when it's a really good hand, your left eye kinda twitches. And if you're bluffing, your nostrils flare. And when it's three of a kind you-- MIKE: All right. All right. I get the point. Couple more games like this, and I'll be owning stock in your company. Sorry, Mike. That's OK. I lose so he can keep you around. Well, he has a few other qualities besides your money he wins. I think that's a polite good night. I couldn't get in, you need like a password or something on the weekend. Jim and I got into a fight about it this morning. He knows that you know? He's not a cross-dresser, if that's what you think. Oh, he's in denial, eh? He's not in denial. So he came out completely? No, he bought it for me. He was just too embarrassed to give it to me. Oh. I need you to help me do something. Do what? Come on. I'm nervous, though. [KNOCKING] Who is it? Come in. Hello. Hi. How you doing, ladies? How are you? Welcome. Yeah, you kidding? It hurt like hell. I was three sheets to the wind, and it still felt like they were yanking my tongue out of me. What are you talking about? Never mind, I don't want to know. So what's going on at the office? Work. Lots of work. Keeping you busy? It's not really the job, per se, it's more the boss. Another tough one? Yeah, this one's going to be a tough nut to crack. Plan of action. Not yet. Give me a few days to figure this one out. How about you? I'm working on a construction site. A what? Yeah, your girlfriend here is a construction worker. They hired you? Of course. Just took the proper attire. Hey, maybe you can use that angle on your assignment? I'm not so sure. I think there's a mole in the company. Really? Deep in? By the looks of her skirt, I'd say very deeply rooted. Well, there's only one way to flush out a mole like that. How? I don't know, but when you figure it out, let me know and I'll tell the others. Thanks, I'll figure something out. Well, try to make it quick because I'm totally backlog on assignments and I need you in a law office in two weeks. CAROL: Have I ever let you down? Detroit, '98. You screwed that up, not me. [INAUDIBLE] to the right. Come right back? OK. You know it. He's so hot. Wow. It's like, for here? Nice. Kylie's going to flip her shit. Oh my got, when she sees him, it's over. It's over, seriously. Wow. Hotty totty. An officer. [LAUGHING] What's up with your hair? Dude, I know, it's this desert. I should go wash it fix it. A comb. A comb would help. Oh. OK. Thanks. What is that. Yahtzee. Want to play? Only my grandma plays that game. Where is Kylie? Oh, I think she's in the bathroom get cleaned up. Oh, cool. Sweet. So, you enjoying yourself? Mm, watching you play the dice is nice. You should try it by yourself. How about you? Yeah. You know, our plans got a little changed, but it's all right. Hello. You have very soft skin. Thanks. I try to take care of it. Yeah. Yeah. You have a very gentle touch. Oh! [LAUGHING] You're bad. Mmmm. No more Yahtzee. Look, the client said a man, not recently a man. Jose, working as a temp for you is never a dull moment. Well, it was your idea. And I just handle the assignment requests and pour the coffee around here now. Hey, Mama. I like your [INAUDIBLE]. I got one for you too. Oh, you did? [GIGGLING] Dude, what happened to the Yahtzee game? You get mad? I was losing. You were losing. [GIGGLING] Yeah, this is so much better. Where's uh, what's his face? Hunky, hunky monkey? I think he's freshening up. I don't know. Where's Kylie? Shoes. She's-- Ooh. Yeah, I don't know where they went to. They're probably-- [PERCUSSIVE MUSIC PLAYING, HEAVY BREATHING] Oh, mamacita, sexy lady. How much fun are we having tonight? I know. This is fantastic. I'm having a very good time. Are you having a good time? - Yes. Good. Yes. Where's Pete? Did you-- did we bring any more games? I don't know. I-- I thought we had, like, Super Yahtzee or something. Oh, that would be fun. In the other-- in the room. I don't know, do we have it? Or no, we have another one. I know we have another one. I'm just going to change. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to put something comfy on. So if anything, I'll look for it. All right, well, look for that other [INAUDIBLE],, too. Maybe we can be twinsies. Ooh, that would be cute. OK, special, special. [SIGHING] Hey, let me give you a hand with that. Hey, Tiger. What you been doing? Looks like I won. But it's not-- it's not like it's a challenging game, is it? Dude, this is my favorite. Are you having fun tonight? Yeah, look at this. This is pretty-- Oh, yeah, how did you recognize me? [BOTH COOING] You're a little aggressive mama, aren't you? [GIGGLING] [KISSING] Look at these boobies. [INHALING, SUCKING] [CHUCKLING] [SMACK] [GIGGLING] [THROATY MEOW] [MOANING] [AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, I'm looking for Jose. That would be me. What can I do for you? Oh, I heard that you run a temp agency. No, he just answers the phones around here and pours the coffee. Oh, I thought you are the owner. Don't listen to her, she's just still angry about Detroit. Detroit? Nothing. I just pour the coffee around here and set the assignments. I'm going to let you guys get on with your interview. Later. See you, Carol. Please don't be shy. Oh, I know. Oh, we're not. Looking all sexy [INAUDIBLE]. We all. [LAUGHTER] And those are those zip away pants. Well, we don't need to use these Velcro right now. [LAUGHS] Yeah. Well, come on in to our, uh-- Want a little lap dance? We would love a little lap dance again. Yeah. [SULTRY MUSIC] [SIGHS] [LAUGHS] Now that's sexy. Why didn't you tell me you were wearing that? I was saving it for later. Honey, you don't get it, do you? Get what? If you show me something early in the night and then again later, I want you more. You want me to wear this in public? I want to make everybody jealous. I want to be proud of my wife. I want every man in that room to wish he was going home with you. But I'm the one that gets to. You're not proud of me? I'm very proud of you. I just wish that you'd let everybody else know how proud I am every now and then. [SULTRY MUSIC] Are you all right, Mr. Marriott? Oh, yeah. I was just thinking. Teresa? Wouldn't she come under the same heading? I don't think so. You are probably the most unusual secretary I've ever had. [LAUGHS] Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I haven't quite figured that out yet. [SIGHS] Jim. Jim, are you ready? Yeah. I'm ready. Ready. Are you OK? Sorry. I must have dozed off. Well, are you ready? Everyone's left. So we can do this now. Right. Yeah. Sure. It's OK. I'll go slow. [LAUGHS] I'm just a little nervous, that's all. Oh, [SIGHS] don't worry. I've done this plenty of times before. Just relax. Let me do all the work. Hey, Jose. It's me. I need you to do me a favor. Yes. I need you to run a check on all the employees at Riddell Corp. ASAP. Get back to me, all right? Bye. [MOANS AND SIGHS] [SULTRY MUSIC] Oh. [SIGHS] Surprise. Hey, what are you two doing here? We got the vibe you needed some inspiration. Well, I can't do anything until this new book is done. So how much do you have? Do you really want to know? So what have you been doing all day? Nothing. This isn't the first time you've have a block. It'll pass. I'm not so sure. Don't be so pessimistic. It can't be that bad. Well, I've tried all my usual techniques and nothing's working. Well, like what? What do you mean? What techniques? Maybe we can help. I doubt it. So what do you usually do? Masturbate, OK? I'd like to see that. So let's do what we talked about. What? It's about time you started living out your fantasies. Well, what do you have in mind? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Dwoller Corporation. How may I direct your call? Well, I got your link and it seems that our Miss Teresa Wiley was a consultant four years ago for Syntax. Oh, really? But that was four years ago. Well, actually she never left. She disappears from all of the employee records, employee lists. But, ironically, I found that she's still on the payroll. Interesting. Thanks, Jose. Bye. [SIGHS] Jose? Yeah, Jose. He runs the temp agency. Oh, so you're going to be leaving me soon. I really don't have a say, do I? I must admit, you're better than most. I doubt you're going to be thinking that very soon. Why? Do you think something's wrong? You do. What are you, a mind reader? [LAUGHS] No, just a secretary with a few good secrets. Secrets. What kind of secrets? An extreme weakness for good Chinese food. So you don't mind staying late and helping me look all this over? Like I said, I have a weakness for good take out. OK. Well, you order the food and I'll cancel with Teresa. [MOANS AND SIGHS] [SULTRY MUSIC] Britt, we did it. Congratulations. No. You did it. [LAUGHS] Although I'm afraid that tomorrow I'm going to have to tender my resignation, boss. Why is that? I don't mix business with pleasure. [SULTRY MUSIC] Ladies and gentlemen, let the fashion show begin. What's this all about? Shh, just enjoy it. With a snip-snip here, and a snip-snip there, I present to you your new wife. You like the change? You look awesome. [LAUGHS] You ain't seen nothing yet from this stuffy old wife. [SULTRY MUSIC] [MOANS AND GIGGLES] You should've seen the look on her face. I wish I could've been there. Yeah. I bet you would. This is too rich. You're totally going to freak this poor girl out. I bet she books a plane ticket by noon. You mean a bus ticket. She doesn't want to miss that country view on her way back. [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE] Hey, Britt. Hey. You sleep well last night? Like a groundhog who saw a shadow. Well, there you go. Just like a groundhog. Looking for something? Batter and oil, of course. Batter and oil. Well, yes. I need to make flapjacks for my lovely host. It's the least I could do Uh, I don't even know what those are. And we don't have any batter. Well, then we better be getting you to the market and bringing some El Paso back here. [SIGHS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] This sucks. Dude. What's up? We have a problem. What? Truck's broken down. Battery? I don't know. I checked everything. Let's radio for help. I already did. And? [LAUGHS] We got to wait out here for three hours. Three hours? What can we do? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Some more chicken fried steak and grits, Bill? I think five helpings is plenty. Oh, but you're still a growing young man. But you know what? I'll leave you a care package in your lunch. That was the best meal I ever had. Momma always said to have a good breakfast. It makes your day a little bit brighter. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Could be worse. We could not have men here. [LAUGHS] We could be stranded alone. We probably wouldn't have ran out of gas in the first place. [LAUGHS] True. You can't argue that. Oh. Oh, it hurts to talk. I think I see a rattlesnake. I think I see water. It's a mirage, honey. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Help. Anybody out there? Can you hear me? Help! Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. We need help. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Oh, you didn't have to do that. But thank you. I just want to repay you for that great meal. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Bill! What are you doing? I don't-- I don't think Julie would appreciate you kissing me. Things work a little different here than in El Paso, Britt. You'd be surprised. [SULTRY MUSIC] [MUSIC ENDS] [WHEEL SQUEAKING] [ROCK MUSIC] Hey, Jules. What's up? Hey, where's Jeff? He ran out. He'll be back in a few. Hi, Darla. I'm-- This is the girl I called about earlier. Did Jeff tell you? Yeah the new client. Nice to meet you. I'm here to-- She's here to see Jeff's studio actually. Just to see what he's up to here. Well, I can assure you, Miss-- Please call me Brittany. So what brings you the West Coast? To see the big city, give her an education on the metro life Oh, really? What kind of education? Britt here just needs to burst out a little. She needs to see what's up and what's down. [LAUGHS] Seems that El Paso is just a little bit too slow these days. I always figured there was a bigger world and I'm here to see it. Better be careful. A place like this can swallow a country girl up. Oh, I'm sure I can handle a few carpetbaggers and ne'er do wells. What did she say? I think what she's trying to say is that the city is just going to be a little too slow for her. Look, missy, you don't know what you've stepped into. This ain't Kansas anymore. Texas. And I think I have a pretty good idea. This is Brittany? Yeah. The one I wrote to so often. The one I spoke so highly to Jeff to. So you want to see what the big city life is about? Jeff will be glad to see you. Maybe you should catch the next plane back to Waco before your delicate southern flower sees too much. What possibly could I see out here I ain't already seen at home? Except ocean, that is. Well, I'm sure in Kansas things move faster than a buffalo with its ass on fire. Texas. Whatever. Let's see how much of Cali you can take before you go running home to mama's apple pies. [SULTRY MUSIC] So what are you doing here? Well, I've been getting these letters for the past few years. Right. Julie's. Yeah, I guess. The handwriting is the same. But I noticed the past year they've changed. Really? Like what? Well, they've become more sensitive, more understanding. Julie must be getting soft with her age. Yeah. I guess. Or maybe she didn't write those letters. So you came to see Julie. That's-- that's great. I didn't come here to see her. I know it was you, Jeff. How long? Long enough. I've been in New York for several years, and I'd like to think I'm quicker on the draw than people give me most credit for. But those letters were coming from El Paso. I had my mom send them out. I don't want you to know. I know it's kind of childish, but I've had the schoolboy crush on you. And I never quite got over it. Yeah, you did. You were a boy then. But you're a man now. I never forget your face. I still dream about it every night. But I'm not that freckled face little girl anymore. No, you're not. You're a beautiful woman. Thank you. For what? For making my dream that much better. I didn't come all the way across the country for a dream. I watched every football game you played. You did? I even went to the Orange Bowl when you won just to see you. Why didn't you come talk to me while you were there? I got 10 feet away from you and I got scared. Scared of what? That I wasn't the 12-year-old girl you liked anymore. You've become much more than that. You've become the woman I've always hoped you'd become. Hey, Lacey. I heard you got your camera. Yeah. Joe's got it at the shop still. So when are we going to make a movie? After I talk to Jill and Carl about their little show. What show? [LAUGHS] Let's just say they learned how to use the camera. Really. They here? No. They went to go get a DVD. They'll be right back though. Are we still up for making a film? Have you come up with the story? No. But Jill and Carl gave me some ideas. OK. What did they film? Let's just say Joe enjoyed it thoroughly. Juicy stuff, huh? Joe is going to erase it. Erase it? Not until I get to see it. So you better get started on writing that story. [LAUGHS] Come on. Let's go get something to eat. [MOANS AND SIGHS] Nothing exciting ever happens around here. Hey. Hey. You figure out a story yet? No. I think I'll return it. Why would you do a thing like that? Maybe I'm not cut out for filmmaking. Where have you been? Oh, Joe and I were discussing acting. Well, if I don't come up with an idea, there won't be a film. What are you two plotting? Oh, nothing. We just thought that you would want to be in your movie, too. What are you talking about? Well, you can't really make a movie until you understand the acting experience. What are you two up to? Just a little payback. Oh, no. This is not going on the films. [LAUGHS] Oh, yes it is. Oh, no. No, no, no. Come on. You are so naughty. You are so mine. Get in here. All right. It's your turn. Mhm. Oh, my god. Oh, this is good. [LAUGHTER] [MOANS AND SIGHS] Oh, this is very good. Better get very resigned to this. Oh, come on. [INAUDIBLE] [MOANS AND SIGHS] [LAUGHTER] Goddammit. [LAUGHS] Dammit, you're not the boy. [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE] She don't wear bras very often. No. But you could try that part. Oh. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHTER] [MOANS AND SIGHS]
