We've landed. We're all set. Good luck, guys. Hey, Julie baby, we've reached the target. So what did she want? Access to the mainframe. Right. Okay. Danger, danger, danger. Ken to control unit. Ken to control unit, come in. Okay, rotate the dish and hook up the box. Then wait for my further instructions. Standing by. It's all right. I told you about the experiment. Are you coming? I'd love to but I really wanna see my dad. It won't be the same without you. Come on. A whole weekend with nothing to do but relax and get studied by some nut. You'll love it. Where is it? I don't know. Elema's coming to pick us up. Shame a scientist's daughter, you don't have to worry about money. They're offering 500 bucks and I need 500 bucks. Sounds great but I still can't let my dad down. He's counting on me. Well, kiss your buddy George for me. It sounds like a real turn on . Where's Mary Rose and Ralph? They're right here. I don't wanna smell any booze on your breath, got it? Yes, ma'am. That's it, out! We have three girls arriving tonight. Get the rooms ready. But what about the guys? Mind your own goddamn business. You may look innocent but you're a slut just like your mother. Have you everything you need, Harry? Yes, Ms. Clingstone. Hey, Tony. What a dice. Not even a Bimbo to pull on around here and when there is, it's yours. You know we don't serve hard liquor here only beer or soda. Hey. You're quantity and I'm quality. Right? I love both. Yes, ma'am. Get out from wherever you're hiding and pick up the girls. Now! Good morning, Daddy! Hello, Jessica. And how's my lovely daughter? So glad to see you. Me too. How do you feel? Like a million bucks. How about you? Don't you ever relax? You own this joint for god's sake. You got 200 patents. 212. Listen, I won't be able to spend very much time with you this weekend. Abandoned for bioelectronics. Story of my life. Well, George will keep me company. We're coming to the end of the test on the biometer. I think we may have something. You always have something, daddy. But tell me, who's the "we"? Julie. So I have to put up with Julie again. She's still after you? Not often enough. It was an accident, Ken. It was an accident, Ken. Stop blaming yourself. Just get outta here, okay, Julie. Just leave me alone. Ken, you've gotta understand. I'm sorry about what happened. But we're almost there now. This last weekend we'll do it. Let's just go check out that killer dog of yours, all right? Ugh! Linda, wait a minute. What's that? Sandwiches. Oh, ma. You know, George, Annie asked me to do some weird psychological test with her. You know how much I like Annie but I like you and dad more. I am flattered. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. Annie said to give you a big kiss. Listen, Ken -- I have nothing to say to you. George. Yes, my dear? Program the race for me. Far out! I love the race. I love you. What would I do without you? Okay. Where'd you learn your manners? Not in a gutter like you, kid. Oh, come on ladies. Cut it out. Why can't you two relax? This sandwich tastes as dry as hell. Tastes like cardboard. Hey, you got anything to drink? Hey. Can lgetinon this little jump? No, thanks. But I'll gladly let you do it on anything else. How about this? Baby, you really turn me on. You move So nice. So do you. Hey, Tony. Let's go. Better get going, ladies. Look. Just let me come with you after the crossroads. Sorry, I can't. Look, just to the crossroad, Jack. That's all. Okay? All right, get in. Look, I told you I'm not ready. Well, Tony, she's all pumped up. Come on, let's go back to Billy's Bar. Reported the last test results. They're 100% positive. Check. Cats, 100%. Rats, 100%. Mice, 100%. Killer alley cats to good-natured house pets, you've had complete personality reversals. It's astounding. I won't take risks, not with human lives. It's a remarkable achievement. Edward, you're too modest. Apache is the most powerful machine ever constructed and I feel privileged to be part of your team. And a very important part of it. What an incredible house. This way, ladies. Hello. I'm Mary Rose, the maid. And this is Harry, the butler. Please make yourselves at home and relax. Just relax. Thanks for the sales pitch but the answer is still no, no humans, not yet. So you'll only let the biometer cure neurosis and house cats and junkyard dogs. No humans till I'm ready. Edward, the whole world is waiting. Think of all those paranoids, schizophrenics. It's criminal to waste any more time. One more game, George. Skill four. Ready when you are. Oh, so someone else has access to Apache, someone's charming daughter. Oh, God, I forgot to turn off Apache. Darling, when you use George, make sure he's not connected to Apache. Okay. Anyway I played badly. I lost the game. I'm going out. Do you need anything? Thanks for the joyride, pal, and for totaling my car. Don't worry, I'll pay you back. I can't hear you, Julie. The subject of this experiment is a highly nervous aggressive doberman trained to kill. After ingestion of the ball, the animal should behave normally. The attempt is to modify or reverse character disorders. It's transforming. It's alive. I've changed the dose. Now, remember, Julie, whatever you do don't let the biometer go beyond 50%. I don't want a crazed dog or even a dead one on our hands. We've dramatically reduced the time required for the synthetic neurons to short out and replace the natural ones that only takes a few milliseconds. I knew it. I knew it! I knew you'd do it. It's fantastic! Well, it all looks pretty good now. But what about the possible long term effects? What about six months from now? Do you still think that loss and inhibitions and suppression of fear is dangerous? I just don't know. It's working beautifully. The dog's behavior is completely changed. Hey, I'm expecting a phone call, okay? That was my seat. If you want it, that's okay. You can have it. Oh my God. You're really very good. Ever think about turning pro? What about you, huh? Don't you wanna take on the pinball wizard? You kidding? She doesn't know a goddamn thing about it. How's everything going? Everything's fine. The test on the dog worked perfectly. Did the guinea pigs arrive? Yeah, they're here. What about Brake? He's never a problem. He doesn't suspect a thing. You know you've only got this weekend, no mistakes. If it wasn't for me you wouldn't even know about this. And for that kind of money, I don't make mistakes. Yeah, just remember that. This is rough. Eating, drinking, never lifting a finger. Sure beats being cooped up in a shop with a bunch of teenagers playing disco games. Ah, you mean you work in a record store. I'm a singer. Or at least I'm gonna try to be one. Well, why don't you stop by the shop and use some recording equipment. Maybe I'll produce the demo. I can just see the headlines now. I love it. Weekend meeting leads to solid gold. Oh. Diary, George. George, I need some info. I don't know what's wrong with me. More data please. I feel so strange. Log out Apache, this is private. I feel weird. I feel like laughing and crying. Paradox. I never felt this way before. I need information. It's like a hole in my stomach, my heart too. I swear it's beating faster. -Aw. -I don't think it's a heart attack and it's not the flu. I'm not sick George. I'm cold, hot, up, down. I'm happy. Do you understand? More data please. When I looked at him, it felt like an electric shock. Just like that I got all wound up inside. Now, I wanna be with him. I wanna be with him, George. Please name this individual. This guy I met, he's so incredible. Analysis in operation. More data please. He's gorgeous, such eyes. And that smile. Oh, he's so adorable. Processing data. I've gotta see him again. George, do something. Please, help me. What is happening to me? Diagnosis, in love. You are in love. That's it! They're all at the pool. I need a personal object from each one of them, something they won't miss. Well, I'll get on it fast, ma'am. I feel badly. You're here and I'm spending all my time with Apache. Professor, I am deeply insulted. I know how hard it's been since mom died, you had to do everything: Be my mom and dad. I just want you to know that I realize what a wonderful father you are. I'm sorry I haven't been. What other dad would have given me George? Remember when I was five, you taught me how to program. Who are you? Maintenance. Well, maybe you can help me. You can never get what you want. Not exactly a conventional childhood, was it? I wouldn't trade It. Is something bothering you, dad? It's the experiments. They're moving so fast. Julie seems to be in such a hurry. Don't let her push you. Well, fortunately she still needs me. She can't do it without me. Here's your special sandwich, Rowdy. Wait here. Relax. Slow down. Don't slip your clutch, honey. Relax. George to Apache, abort program. Insufficient data. Confirm response. Test connection faulty. Received channel death. But I just wanted ... Shit! Little bitch. You okay? What happened? Did you see a ghost? A spider. I hate spiders. Thanks. Anytime. So you don't like spiders, hmm? How about butlers? Oh, you wanna play spiders? I'm no fly. Anyway, you think I wanna play with that bitch's little puppy dog? Come on, fetch it. Come on! Fetch! Fetch! Something's fishy. I wanna get out of here. What do you mean? This is paradise. I don't know. I didn't sleep a wink. What's the matter with you? Hey, wake up. Doesn't anybody care? And how should I dress? Boys who like girls in dresses 88%. What about the colors? White. White, are you sure? For a brunette, yes. 74% prefer. Okay. Now, find a way for me to meet him. Mansion, difficult. Busy weekend. Probabilities for other meeting. Bars 82%, discos 76%, hitch hiking 66%. Hitch hiking, that's it. Thanks, George. Dave. Dave, honey. I want you. You think you're so fucking great, don't you? Oh go fuck little miss innocent. Get this to San Jose as soon as possible. Lonely, baby? Want some pinball action? Or just standing action? Get lost you miserable creep. What? I thought you were somebody else. Nice talk. Maybe you're not such a little innocent virgin after all. You'll never find out. You ain't a bad looking chick. How about one for the road? I'll make it a quickie. You got it all wrong, baby. I'm a nice guy. Now let's see what you've got. Bitch. Danger. Danger. Danger. Danger. Danger. Danger. Danger. Danger. Danger. Yes, Julie? I've got it at seven. Yes, you're right. I'll check it. George to Apache. High priority interrupt required. Emergency program code Protection Jessica. Repeat, Protection Jessica. You didn't feed the dog. Yeah, sure. I'll be glad to. Okay, buddy. See you Saturday. Hey, Mike. Telephone. What? You can't answer the phone? Hey, it's not my store, buddy. Yeah. Oh, Ms. Clingstone. You picked up my car. Yeah, we got your car. Yeah, drove it into a tree. How 'd you do that? None of your goddamn business. Oh . is it fixed? We got it. Is it fixed? Yeah, I can fix it. Our mechanic's working on it right now. Hey, Mike, tell her I got the car right here, man. Go ahead. We'll have it for you by tomorrow. It better be. Yeah, tomorrow morning. Make it early. Okay, all right. Hey, where you've been? I just bought Billy's Bar. Not bad, huh? Right on! All right. What a guy. His dad buys him everything he owns. I sure like you riding back here. I can get used to that. Fill her up? Fill her up. Jessica, I'm sorry. I've got to deliver the parcel as soon as possible. Can't we be together tonight? There's no where in the world I'd rather be. Believe me, there's important business. Can't it wait? Now even for me? It's important to my future. Our future if it works out right. That'll be six bucks. I'll tell you what. I might get into trouble but I'm gonna leave a little later, okay? That'll give us some more time. I'll have to stop by and tell my dad that I'll be away, okay? Look, I'm telling you I haven't seen him. We had a date here at 2 and I'm getting tired of hanging around waiting for him. Shit. He's got my helmet. Doesn't have his own? Yeah, well, you got your own bike. Can't stop people taking mine. That's not the same. And remember, I'm the boss. Hey, Fil, you seen Dave? Yeah, he had a drink, drove out and say he'd be back. I thought a saw a motorcycle down by the lake. I'm not sure but I thought it was Dave's bike. Come on, let's go. What's up? I don't understand it. Did he eat anything unusual? Not that I know of. The poor thing's in agony. Maybe the experiments -- The experiments are perfect. We've just got a sick dog on our hands. Check over there. Gary, you go that way. Dave. Dave. Dave. Dave. Hey, boys. Help me with this bike. The death seems quite abnormal, must have been an internal hemorrhage. I called the vet. He'll wait for you. Okay. But cancel tonight's experiment. Don't jump to conclusions. I told you I don't wanna take risks, not with human lives. You know the deal. I speed up the experiment and betray an honest man. You give me a third of the profits and a half a million upfront. Okay. Okay, how do you want it? Just hand it to Ken. Do you trust him? Sure. But what are you going to do about Jessica? Just let me handle the professor's little bitch. Daddy. What do you want? Where's my dad? I asked you a simple question. Why can't you answer? When will he be back? I'm his colleague not his secretary. Oh, I thought you were more than that. Anyway, give him a message for me. Tell him that I'll be at my friend's house tonight and that I'll be back home tomorrow for lunch. I'll tell him. I bet the lucky guy's very well hung . Shit. That's the house where Bob was killed. You're everything I hate. Why don't you go bitch somewhere else. Ken. Let me explain. Explain what? That we're lovers. Jessi, Jessi, I can explain. No, listen. Jessica! Jessica! You're a world class bitch, a killer! First Bob and now you're after Jessica. Bob, you know that was an accident. An accident? A saw his face! That was no accident. I've done this for us. Together we can be rich and powerful. But you'd better not give me trouble because you know I can make things very uncomfortable. You don't wanna explain that little accident to the police, do you? Jessica! Jessica! Why don't you take a walk? What are you trying to say? Nothing. It's weird. You listen, Ralph. Those chicks up at the mansion, what are they doing up there? I don't know anything about it. Some sort of testing. Something about a relaxation. How do I know? I only follow orders. Well, could you get us invited? I mean, we're not so bad. Hey, look. Private. Closed. Like I said it's some kind of test. Yeah, sure. Christ, girl, I'm in love with you. You know, I mean, our world has changed since we met. Everything's different now. I'm finally starting to feel good about what's deep down inside of me, you know. Just the thought that you love that witch. You know she was after my father too. Jessica, I swear I never really loved her. One thing you're right about, our world did change the day we met. Isn't that tight? Maybe they'll be a lot of good looking guys with big muscles . Are you expected? Yeah, I'm Gary. This is Tony. That's me. If you gentleman would be kind enough to wait on the patio. I'll have you announced. Come on. Ms. Clingstone, there are two unknown men here. They seem okay. Okay. Make sure they have everything they need. Oh, and Harry, take the night off. What's the matter with Pam? I don't know. Just probably depressed about something. Okay, what about this? Too revealing? No, you've got good legs. Where is everybody? It's weird. Hey, what's going on? Spooky. Hey, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. I feel like I've been here before. Obviously, you were here yesterday. Come on quit joking. I'm telling you I've seen this place. You know, Annie, a lot of staircases look the same. Wait a minute. It was a photograph, a picture that Jessica -- Who's Jessica? She's my best friend. She's adorable. She told me a lot about her father, her assistant, and their work. Are you sure you're all right? I remember because Jessica couldn't stand, yeah, Julie Clingstone. She's a very dangerous woman according to Jessica. Hey, I don't know how to say this. But, I hope we can see more of each other. I mean ... Don't you like me? I'm sure it was that staircase. The entrance in the picture look just like that. We have to talk about staircases? Well, do we? No, sorry. The first time I saw you, sipping your drink at the bar, I... I just thought you were terrific. I felt something real deep, something nice. I'm not so used to that. Tony, you're a really wonderful guy and very, very sexy. You were great. What a weekend. I'm walking on air. Is it your fault? What's my fault? I wondered, if it's you that's making me feel so fine so deep down good. I hope so. You were great, Linda. I never had it so good. I liked it. I liked it. And I wouldn't mind a return match . Killing time. No way, baby. Hey, your panties are cute. Silk's really sexy, huh? How I like being so close to him. To touch him. I want him to hold me tight. Stroke my face, kiss me, love me. He's so kind, so gentle. His body on mine feels so wonderful. He's looking at me now so tenderly. I wanna tell him with my hands. Yes, I feel his heart is calling me. I know now that he really loves me. His eyes, only telling me that he loves me. George was right. I am in love. Oh my only need. I don't want this to end ever. You know, this place seems so familiar to me. Look, I thought you got over that ghost stuff. I have. Well, anyway, I like the way this ghost dances with me. So tell me, how do I make love to a ghost? I have it. Harry, collect something from this guy. I found a key there. Leave them there. Right, ma'am. Why only half? It's a long story, not very pretty. My friend Bob's got the other half. He meant a lot to you. Best friend I ever had, till I met you. He saved my life. We did everything together. I'll tell you about it at some time. Yes, it went perfectly. No hitches. Were the subjects totally transformed? Yes, it was horrible but it works. It's an impressive performance. I told you I could handle it. Don't worry, I'll clean up the mess. Linda! You want them all, don't you? What are you talking about? You bitch! What the hell are you doing? What's going on here? I'll meet you at the Air Ranch at 9, okay? All right. All right? All right. Come on. What are you smiling at? I'll see you later, baby. What the hell's going on here? I want it at a 100%. Julie, you've gone crazy. You don't know what it could do to these kids. It could destroy them, turn them into neuropaths! You could ruin everything we've worked on for years! You got here too soon, Edward. Why are you doing this to the project? To all of us? It looks like you sold me out. Get out of here. You're fired! Daddy. Daddy? Are you there? Julie, you scared me! Don't you ever knock when you come into a room? Your father just called. He's waiting for you at the mansion. It's extremely urgent. Is he okay? I think so. But you better get over there right away. Daddy? Daddy? Annie? Shh, don't talk. My poor, honey. I tried not to tell you but all this is your father's work. No. Daddy! Not him? He couldn't want this. I know how you feel, Jessica. I really do. But you never know what he's thinking, you know that. I don't believe it! You're lying! Ask Ken if you don't believe me! It's not possible. Someone please tell her it's not true. Unfortunately it's both possible and very true. You bitch! You're not satisfied with creating these. You tried to turn my child against me! And I trusted you with everything! Don't be stupid, Edward. After all this now I am giving the orders. The tapes are already in San Jose. Well, if you've finished playing out your little mellow drama I'll leave now. I have a lot of work to do. Would you please patch up these neuropaths, professor? Stop it, Daddy! You can't help them. That's pointless, Edward. You're just another mad scientist. A millionaire quack! How are you going to explain all this horror to the police? I don't believe her. You know I love you. I couldn't believe her. My Jessica. I know. I know. Ken, are you receiving me? Hello? Hello, Ken, honey. Where are you? I'm here at the Air Ranch. Did you collect the money from San Jose? Yeah, I collected the money. Okay, wait right there I'll be right over. We're rich baby! We're rich! Not "we". Me. You made one big mistake. See the cashier's check was already made out to me. What is this bullshit? No bullshit. I've got the videotape too. Jessica, sweetheart. Help me get rid of this junk. What? What junk? Sorry, Daddy, I'm in a hurry. Ken's waiting for me at the ranch. I'll give you a call from campus, okay? Dad, wish me luck with Ken. Thanks for reactivating George. Ken! Ken! Ken! Emergency program code! Protection Jessica. No!
