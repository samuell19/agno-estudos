Control Tower. We've been monitoring the asteroid. I think-- We think it's going to land anytime now in an unknown place. With a trajectory of 25 miles across, it will cross the sea, and, well, no one knows, it's going to land in the… Supreme Leader of Mars, Engineer Zoragon reporting in. Zoragon, what happened? I've collected the energy canister from Saturn. I was attacked and had to land on Earth. It must have been Zoragas. He wants the canister and to take over the Martian government. Hurry! Return to Mars now! Sir, my ship needs to be repaired. Do whatever is necessary. Remember! The canister is Mars' source of energy. We waited for years to collect energy when Saturn was between the Earth and the Sun. Our energy source is depleting. The entire Martian civilization will disappear if anything happens to the canister. What should we do now, General? We'll wait here, he can't go far. Leave this place, demon! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet. Quiet! Finally, he's quiet. I have expelled the demon from his body. Thank you, Wak Kernal. For healing my husband. It has been a week since his fever started. My nephew said he had a fever. He told me to bring him to a doctor. I refused. I knew he'd been bewitched by someone. He really was bewitched. You don't need to take him to a doctor. They can't heal him. The only one who can heal your husband is me, Wak Kernal. Don't you know? Get rid of the demon, get rid of it. Where is the money? Bring it out, demon. How much is it, Wak? That's up to you. I don't want any more than that. A hundred would do. Don't bother my grandchildren. Here, Wak. Thanks. I made some magic water. Give it to your husband to drink. One more thing. Tell him not to go against the taboos I mentioned. What are the taboos, Wak? Don't urinate under the tree at my house. It's okay if it's someone else's house. He can do as he likes there. -Yes. -Please excuse me. -God is Great. -Thanks, Wak. God is Great. Peace be upon you. Wake up, dear. Wake up, dear. It's not easy being a witch doctor, you know? I meditated on seven mountains. I have vanquished all sorts of devils, ghosts, and demons. Otherwise, don't call me Witch Doctor Wak Kernal. -The famous witch doctor. Understand? -Dear! -No! -My husband is dead! -Wake up, dear! -That's it! Zoragon calling Mars Supreme Leader. What is your situation, Zoragon? My ship crashed again, sir. The energy canister is still in my hands. Secure the energy canister first. Fix your ship and come home. The problem is, I do not know the location of my ship. That's not an excuse! Remember. The lives of your fellow Martians are in your hands! Peace be upon you, Tok. And unto you, peace. What is it? -The villagers found something weird, Tok. -What? -That's right. -Yes, at the edge of the village. Let's go. Over there, Tok. Over here, Tok. There it is, Tok. Tok, where are you going? It's so big. What is it? I don't know, Tok. The villagers saw it fall out of the sky. Really? Don't touch it. -You! -Yes, Tok. Inform the members of Parliament, JPJ, Immigration, Customs. -Tell everyone. -You don't have to! -Who is this? -They don't know. Why are you shouting? This is none of your business. This is mine, you know? -Tok will handle it? -Yes. You don't even know what this is. Do you know what this is? If I don't know, don't call me Wak Kernal. -Call me Wak Meja. Move aside! -Liar. Wait a second, be patient. All of you move aside. -Let him do his work. -Move aside. Move aside. Move aside. What is he going to do, Tok? Let him be. We'll just see. Now I know. I am a witch doctor. Actually, this is a demon's nest. Don't you have anything better to do? As long as the thing is weird, you'll say it's superstition. If it's not superstition, what is it? This thing fell from the sky, right into our village. -What does this mean? -What does it mean? It means bad things are about to happen in our village. No one can save our village, other than Wak, the witch doctor. Who else, if not Witch Doctor Wak? No one else. Village chief. -Now what? -My son, Mat Top. -He didn't come home last night. -What? Mat Top! Mat Top! Mat Top! Mat Top! -Mat Top! -Over there. -What's wrong? -Mat Top! Mat Top! Mat Top! What happened to you? Soaking yourself in the river. Over here! Come on up! What's wrong with you? Where are your clothes? What is this? -What is that? -Give it to me. My son is not only deaf, but mute as well. This is what happens when you go against the taboo. What taboo? I gave birth to him. -You just moved into the village. -Tok! Tok! -We found Mat Top. -Mat Top, my son! -Tok! -Mat Top! Where were you, Mat Top? My dear son. I was looking for you everywhere. -Where were you? I was worried. -I didn't go anywhere. -What? -Mat Top can speak. Move aside. Try saying siji, loro, telu, papat. Siji… Try saying one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Thanks to God. At last, I have successfully healed Mat Top. Stop it! Where did you find him? Over there by the riverbank, Tok. When we found him, he wasn't wearing any clothes. -May God forgive me. -We… This must be the work of the demon. Enough. It'd be better if you went home. You can heal the deaf and mute. Mat Top? Where is my son Mat Top? Demon, hear me! I know where you came from. Don't bother my children and grandchildren! What? He has no children. When did he have grandchildren? -Useless! -That's him. Like I said, the demon is angry, Tok! -Peace be upon you. -And unto you, peace. We are from the government and we are investigating a UFO. There is no black coffee or plain tea here. If you want a drink, go to the stall. There's none here, understand? Watch your mouth. What are your names? My name is Ali. This is my assistant, Minah. You look chic. But your names are like village people's names. You are bothersome. Miss Minah, Mr. Ali, come this way. Follow me. This fell in the middle of the night. Do you know what this is? This is what we are investigating. This thing is very dangerous. I advise all of you to leave at once. -What? -That's right! I agree. Let me, Mr. Ali, and Miss Minah handle it. The rest may go. No, you must leave this place as well. If Mr. Ali and Miss Minah fall ill, who will be in trouble? If Miss Minah screams like a possessed person, who will heal her? Me! Tok, look at that. Mat Top. This boy. Where did you go? Your mother is looking for you. What's the matter with you? You can speak. Why don't you want to speak now? Tok, look at that. Zoragon. Do you know who I am? -Zoragas. -That's the demon! Demon! General! It's obvious. Our village is being attacked by demons. Prepare the money! I will cleanse our village, Tok. That's my bicycle! Don't run! Zoragon! You can't run away from me! Stupid! Try saying one, two, three, four. One, two, three. One, two. One is enough. Quiet. -My goodness! -Quiet. Thanks to God. I successfully healed your deafness. One of you, go to Mat Top's house and ask for money from his mother. I have successfully healed Mat Top. Hey! Saw running someone? Did you see someone running? Where are we? -Help! There's a rapist! -Miss, I'm not a bad guy. I only wanted to ask for help. I'm new here. -Can you help me? -You're asking for help? Do you think I don't know your intentions? -Miss! -Help! You don't need to ask for help. Ouch. Why do you need help? Aren't you a local? Where are you from? Mars. Where is that? Speak properly. Don't fool around. Hungry? I must eat the food of Earthlings. -I can only give you a lift this far. -Food? Eat yourself. Twenty ringgits. -Tank number three. -Thanks. What are you doing? What else? Filling up. Then there's power. Power? Fill your tummy? SALE IN MALAYSIAN RINGGIT Are you mad? Why are you swallowing gas? I'm hungry. If I fill up with gas, then I'll have energy. Someone's on fire! I don't know who you are or what you want! I want you to leave me alone! Return my gas money! Marang prapu kepunden parang skepper. Marang prapu kepunden parang skepper! Cat? What's wrong with you? Marang prapu… Zoragon. I don't want to believe your story. But, if it's true… you are a Martian. How did you learn to speak Malay? If I spoke another language, people would not understand. That is nasi goreng. Fire came out. What now? You told me stories of your extraordinary adventures. Now, you are on Earth. You kidnapped me. We met and you asked for my help. I have helped you. What now? -I'll go to your house. -What? My house? -Why? -Are you going to leave me here? I don't know you. You don't know me. What? I'm Zoragon. You are Siti. We're acquainted, right? Just like that? You're not afraid? I could be an evil person. A wanted criminal. Looking for victims. Looking for someone like you. I'll take you back to my house. I'll knock you out. Then, I'll tie you up. Keep you in the storeroom. Leave you without food for days. For weeks, years. Do you want to go back to my house? Is your storeroom big or small? Bribing. It's a very dangerous phenomenon. Bad people involved in this disgusting practice, whether they are the ones giving or receiving, should be hung in public. They use money and worldly goods as a shortcut to make a quick buck. They prey upon unsuspecting victims. Why is that? When will the people be successful? When will the country be respected? Do we want to be a race that is shallow, because of our greed? I know. You don't like me looking like this, right? That's not a problem. If you want-- …bad people will do as they please, with their rotten habits. What's the problem? What's the problem? What's the problem? What's the problem? -What's the problem? That's all? -Do you also like Wan Zaman? Why do you like Wan Zaman? He has personality, charisma. The style of a man with principle. Firm and opinionated. Do you want me to be Wan Zaman? I can be whoever you like. Smoke! -Peace be upon you. -And unto you, peace. There's a girl over there. Hi, there. All alone? She's responding. That's good. Not bad. Hi, miss. You're all dolled up, can I keep you company? Let's go. -We're going to a disco, okay? -Zolidia. Where are you going? They invited me to a disco, General. Disco? Hurry up. Zoragon stopped by. He's in a car with a woman. A human. You wait here, okay. Wait. Hello! Why are you sneaking around like a thief? Useless child. Come here! You're only home when it's dark? What's wrong, Father? This is not the first time I've come home at night. Didn't you hear about the demon's nest that fell on the other village? I thought the demon took you away. You're being ridiculous, Father. Dear, look at who that is. Really? "What's the problem?" What's the problem? Look at him, Temah. Do you know who he is? Wan Zaman, the guy on television. -What's the problem? -Father. He is not Wan Zaman. This is Agon. He just looks like Wan Zaman. He's a good friend from college. Really. I know. I was only joking. Famous people don't bother coming to places like this. People who look familiar are everywhere. I was once also chased by people. They said I look like Chef Wan. One time, three busloads of people came here to see Chef Wan. I said Chef Wan, the cook isn't here. The person here is Pak Seman, the one who fries. Please, have a drink. It's just tea. It's okay. There goes my face. Temah! Are you okay? That water is hot! Of course it's hot, it doesn't taste good if it's cold. Don't be such a glutton. My wife! -Not yet! -Not yet? I want to practice. I don't want to make mistakes. Let's go to the movies. The film is exciting. The actor's name is Rosyam Nor. I don't want to. I just got home. You just got home? Are you afraid? Never mind. -I'll tell your parents, okay? -Rosman! I really admire you. Listen to this. Those Mat Rempit are getting to be too much! Such a nuisance. Just like monkeys released from cages. Why are they running rampant these days? What if it happens to children-- That is someone else. This is the opposite of Zaman. What I mean is, he looks like Wan Zaman. -When did you get here, Man? -I just arrived, Mother. Since when do you call me Mother? There's nothing between you two yet. Man, this is Agon, Siti's classmate. Agon, this is Rosman, Siti's fiancé. They're getting married in a month's time. Where do you live? He lives in Kota Kinabalu. That's far. So where will you sleep tonight? If you have nowhere to go tonight, just sleep here. Then, can I sleep here? Have you lost your mind? Your house is over there. Go sleep there. What's the matter with this kid? Agon. Agon. Agon. -You startled me! -What is this? Follow me. -Look at that. -Wear this. Doesn't he look like Wan Zaman? I think there's something wrong with your friend. It's impossible for someone to look 100% like someone else. Look. Maybe he's not a person. If he's not human, then what? An alien from Mars? There you go! Rubbish. You always watch Aziz M. Osman films. You always talk nonsense. He really is Wan Zaman. Since you're such a huge fan, he came to see you. Rosman. He is Agon. He came to look up his old friend. He's lying about looking up old friends. Do you think I don't know this? He wants to take you away from me. I swear. Men are all the same. I'm not like that, I'm a gentleman. You're jealous over nothing. Agon is all alone in this world. All alone? Why are you bothered? You're my fiancée. Next month, you're getting married to me. You'll be my wife. I don't want you to be friends with that fake Wan Zaman. Understand? I think the canister is in this river. But the river is too long. I don't know which side. What's wrong with me? Why? My eyes! -They're leaking! -Are you crying? Why am I crying? Maybe you're feeling sad. Haven't you ever felt sad? Martians only feel two things. Bravery and fear. We're only afraid of marang prapu kepunden parang skepper. Parang skepper? So, you've never been happy? Excited? What? I will try to make you laugh. Let's say I'm looking at your planet right now. Why am I closing one of my eyes? If you close both eyes, how can you see? Ouch. You fell down. I was crying and then I laughed. After that, I felt better. It's hard to explain human feelings. Especially love. How do I feel love? I can't show it to you. Maybe one day, you'll experience it yourself. When? I can't stay on Earth for long. The problem is my ship. A village in Malaysia is different from a village in America, for example. In America, there's hip-hop. What's this? But in Malaysia… How is it at your place? There's culture where I'm from too. I remember. Like this. On Earth, humans look alike. But, why are there different cultures and beliefs? It's interesting. There's variety. What if what you like… others don't like? If people say what you believe in is wrong? In colors, there are light and dark shades. That's true. At my place, we live with one belief. One culture, one rule. Yet many are still not satisfied. They are greedy and I became the fall guy. Trapped here. Luckily, I found you. Why, Agon? In here, a moment ago, it was beating normally. Beating normally. Now it's beating faster. Beating fast. Beating fast. -Your heart. -My heart? Sorry. That's not my culture. Me too. Besides, you're not from this world. You're from space. It's impossible for us… It's impossible! It's impossible! Even if it was possible, I only admire you because you look like Wan Zaman. That means I'm not honest in liking you. Actually… I'm not dishonest. -I… -Never mind. Besides, I will be going back to my place. There, lots of people need me. How will you get back? This is the only hope of me getting my ship back. If Earth has a device as advanced as this… Do you think only Martians are clever? Guess who this is? What? Mazlan? Which Mazlan is that? You have a lot of boyfriends. You even forgot about me. We just chatted last night on Myspace. Now you know me. There's a new film at the cinema. The actor is Rosyam Nor. Come on, my treat. You're treating which Dina now? Siti! When did you get here? Why do you want to treat me using Dinar currency? Did you think this is Isketambola? All transactions are in Malaysian Ringgit, you know! Useless! Come with me. Siti. There's a businessman from Cairo looking for me. He wants to open a Tongkat Ali date juice factory. But he wanted to pay using the Dinar? It doesn't make sense at all. Siti, why are you here? Has that fake Wan Zaman left? That's making me feel uneasy. Dad really likes Agon, but don't worry. Agon said he had to leave as soon as possible. Tell him to go, the sooner the better. Tell him to be respectful. He is staying at my fiancée's house. Siti, let's go watch that Rosyam Nor's film. I'm not a Rosyam Nor fan. He's an old hero. That's where you're wrong. Old heroes are good. What about young heroes? Hopeless! Their acting is so wooden. That's why no one wants to watch Malay films. Instead of watching films, it's better to sit here and chat. That's better. Besides, it's not often I come over to your house. That's true. My mother isn't home. They went to Kuala Lumpur. We can… -We can't but next month, it'll be okay. -We can. Be patient. Aren't you going to get me something to drink? Okay. I'll go inside for a bit. I'll make a special drink for you. Wait for a while. I just remembered I haven't washed the clothes at home. I'm going home. Demon of the seven skies! I know you're inside! Don't disturb my children and grandchildren! Don't! Don't disturb them! Tell me! Tell me! He wants roast chicken. Free-range chicken! Free-range chicken! -There's more! -You startled me. He wants curry puff. Keria cake. Shaved ice. -Sweet lotus soup. -You startled me! There's more! He wants water to wash hands, a tissue… Okay. He came back to life! Who came back to life? Zoragon! Zoragon came back to life? But when did he die? Shut your mouth. Keep driving. Okay. Insolent! You are disrespectful! You come to my turf and you want to pick a fight with me? Rosman! What's wrong? I told you, this man can't be trusted. Hey! -What is it? -What is going on? Mother, Father! This piece of scum you have been sheltering wants to insult Siti's modesty. Rosman! You shouldn't make up stories! You were sleeping, how would you know? I saw with my own eyes. Agon! -Were you really going to hurt my child? -Really? He's shaking. Look! He's shaking, he doesn't know how to answer. He had bad intentions. -I'll smash his head. -Be patient! Why did you come to my house so late at night? Actually, my phone is missing. I came here to look for my phone. Dear God! What? What did you do to my phone? You are too much. You are too much. Rosman! I took your phone. Agon is innocent. Keep quiet! You are flirtatious! -Why are you defending this thief? -Are you deaf? I stole your phone. If you want, attack me instead. Father, Mother. Look! She told me to attack her! Can I? What nonsense are you saying? Why did you take his phone? Siti wanted to help me. That telephone is the only hope I have of knowing where my ship is. Now, I know where my ship is. I can now go home. Agon works on a sea boat. He got left behind. That's why he needed to call to look for his ship again. Keep quiet! He wants to work on a ship, a barge, dredger, that's his business. But why did he break my phone? Give me my phone. You take this one. I will replace your phone. Now, everything is done. Agon, let's go back to bed. Let me take you to your room. -Siti! -Have you lost your mind? Where are you taking him? May God forgive me, Siti. I was just taking him. What else do you want? The cock is crowing. Go home! I'm not satisfied. Ever since that useless man came here, the family has been ignoring me. I'm the future son-in-law. I'm hurt. Why is he being dramatic so late at night? Mother, Father. I don't care. Choose between the two, Mother. Either you cut ties with that fake reporter, or I will call off our engagement. Siti! Listen carefully. The final word is in your hands. Do you choose that man or me? Never mind, Siti. If you don't want to answer, it's okay. Do you think I don't have my pride? Listen, Siti. I'm breaking my engagement with you with one talak. Understand! Siti! I'm flying away. How could Siti do this to me? Never mind, Siti. Today is my day. Tomorrow is yours, then you'll know. What is this? Who is this? What? This phone is weird. He came back on. On? When did he die? He is getting closer. Just a bit more. We're so close. Where, General? -Where? -What now? He's getting further away. -He is getting further away. -Far? Behind us! Behind? What's behind us? Behind us, silly! Insolent people! These gangsters want to show off in my village! Right on time. Get out! I'm just itching for a fight! I notice that you look weird. Are you Men in Black or the group MX3? You can't run away from me now. Give me the canister. What canister? What do you mean? What canister? I have a chicken piggy bank, but I broke it a long time ago. Why did you do this to me? General. This is not Zoragon. He's a male hag! Who is causing all this ruckus so early in the morning? Even if you seek treatment… I'm Wan Zaman and this is my assistant, Siti. We want to interview the famous Wak Kernal. I am very famous. Not only in Malaysia, in fact, in the Asia Pacific region too. Next week, I'll be leaving for Japan. Are you getting treatment over there? No, not for treatment. I'm going to a film festival over there. There's a film producer who wants to tell the story of my life. Where is the ship, Wak? What ship? What Mr. Zaman meant is, the demon's nest. Where do you keep it? That is very dangerous. Do you know, yesterday it moved on its own? That means there's a demon inside it. -No such thing! -It's true, there's nothing! No one can destroy this demon other than Wak Kernal. Quiet! He just arrived. -Who? -The demon. Quickly record this. Record! Demon, hear me! I know where you come from. Come and face me. Change the angle. I can't see you. You're too short. Come here. Come forth, demon. I know your origins. Don't try to fight me. Don't! Change the angle. I can't see properly. Come in! Where is Wan Zaman? Zoragon! How dare you break the tradition? According to the UFO Crash Prohibition Zone Act, you should have crashed in a western country. Why did you crash in Malaysia? Siti! Who are you friends with? They are all demons, you know? What do you mean, demons? They are aliens. Silly man. You didn't watch the X-Files movie. How would you know? General Zoragas! They are not connected to us. Let them go. What are you waiting for? I have let you go. So go! He is letting us go just like that? That's good. Right, Siti? Everyone is fine, let's go. Hurry. -Peace be upon you. -And unto you, peace. -Excuse me. -Yes. Sir. I want my phone back. Siti! Let's go home. Let's go home! He is not letting us go that easily. Siti. You're a woman. Don't interfere in these matters. This is men's work. Enough! Let's go home. Agon! What will he do after this? They are threatening Mars' leaders. They want to use energy canisters to blow up Earth. Mr. General, I'm not criticizing your work. Your work is good. If you blow up Earth, where are we going to stay? Yes, that's right. May God forgive me. I will build low-cost houses on the Moon. Good! Siti, let's go home. We will be getting a new home. It's settled. Everything is settled. No one lives on the Moon. What's wrong with you? Sir, please don't kill us. I still want to live. I haven't gotten married yet. Don't. As far as I know, up until now, humans have done all sorts of things to destroy themselves. Right now, I'm helping you… destroy all of them. Are you trying to send a message? General, why are you so mean? Wealth and power are all meaningless. Isn't that right? Let's talk. It's not good if we aliens fight amongst ourselves. Sure. In your dreams! Now, I'm going to destroy this planet. Zolidia, destroy the ship. General! Zoragon, I know you like this woman. Put down your weapon. Don't waste time. Just shoot him. Shoot! If you won't, I'll do it. Just shoot! Shoot him yourself. Zoragon, right now you can shoot me, and this woman can save Earth and Mars. What are you waiting for? Agon! Just shoot! -Why didn't you shoot? -How can I shoot? I've changed into a human just like the rest of you. I have all sorts of feelings. If I shoot, I'll shoot Siti as well. We'll all be safe. However, I'll regret it all my life because I shot someone I love. Useless. Stupid! Where is that useless guy? Where is Siti? Get out! That hurts! Let me go! Get in! Where are you taking me? The Supreme Leader of Mars. General Zoragas wants to make an announcement. The energy canister will be in my hands. I will destroy Earth so that you and all Martians can witness my power! This is where your canister landed. What does the canister look like? Does it look like Tabung Haji? Although your species will be extinct soon, I am giving you a chance to live. You can stay on Mars if you wish. If you like, you can change your looks into a Martian. To save the human race, I better get that canister. Mat Top! What are you waiting for? Jump into the river. This old man is talking nonsense. Zoragon! Can your gun shoot that ship? Why don't you shoot? Just shoot. I know you're crazy about my fiancée, but use your brain. Billions of people will die because of her. Okay. Go on shoot! I don't want to. He might shoot back at me. Move aside. If you won't, I'll shoot. There's no need! Take it! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! General Zoragas. Congratulations on getting back the energy canister. Zoragon, you don't have to be nice to me. I advise you to have fun with your human friends. Before all of you go boom! General! I'm not afraid to die at your hands. I'm only afraid to be eaten alive by marang prapu kepunden parang skepper. On Mars, just one marang prapu is enough to scare us. But on Earth, there are thousands. Small and big ones. I would rather die than live on Earth. -What nonsense? Are you mad? -Quiet! Tough luck, Zoragon. On Earth, marang prapu can be found everywhere. I'm scared. One has already entered the general's ship. Where? Are you lying to me? Don't be too confident, General. Perhaps, the biggest marang prapu is sitting next to the general. Isn't that right, Siti? Siti! Siti! Siti! Siti! Siti! Siti. Siti! Siti. Where is that alien? He's not here. Where did he go? He just disappeared. Don't be scared. He won't bother us anymore. Agon. This is what you want, right? The problem is how do I send this energy canister back to Mars? The ships here… They're all ruined. The spare parts aren't sold here. -Only on Mars. -Be patient. Okay. I have an idea. Soon, some of our people will be chosen for a space flight. You could try to register to be one. They go to the moon in a rocket. You could hitch a ride. Then you can transit for a while on the moon. Whoever wants to go to Maghrib… -Mars. -Whatever. That's it. What do you think? Good? Rubbish! I can help you. I will get the daddy of all genies to send you home. If that daddy genie is busy, I can find a grandfather genie to send you home. Hello? Zoragon is here. Who is there? I'm okay. The energy canister is safe. It's with me now. However, I have to wait for a rocket from Earth to return to Mars. When is the rocket leaving? How? I have to leave now. What is that? This liquid will change me into my original form. You'll become short like them? Whatever form I want. Siti. Thank you for helping me. I hope you will be happy with Rosman. Siti, you can still come with me back to Mars. Siti, don't be afraid. When we get there, I will take you sightseeing around the planets. After that, we can play with the asteroids. But I'll have to transform myself to look like a Martian. Martians only have two feelings. I don't want the love we have to disappear. I'll just remain here. I want to keep that feeling of love forever. Enough! Don't waste time. Everyone knows you won't inject this thing. Rosman, just speak Malay. They can understand. Really? Mr. Alien. All right. Let Zoragon stay here with us. Besides, my fiancée likes him. Sir, you already have the energy canister. So, sir, what do you think? What are they saying? He said you are a good man. He wants you to marry his daughter. No, thanks. She's too weird. I am allowed to stay on Earth. Mat Top, where are you going? What do I tell Mat Top's mother? -What a nuisance! -Zoragon. Good luck on being an Earthling and I wish you both the best. I think you have a bigger and heavier responsibility. -You have to teach me everything. -That is not a problem. The first thing I have to ask is, have you been circumcised? What happened to that evil alien? He said if you're injected with this, you can change into anything. WAK KERNAL MEDICAL CENTER Tell me, what do you want to be? Pretty? Sweet? You want to look young? Just say it. -Can I, Wak? -Why not? Haven't you heard the name Wak Kernal, the famous witch doctor? I have, Wak. But people say you keep a demon as a pet. I don't keep a demon as a pet! Don't believe all that. It's superstition! If you believe in it, it's a sin. Don't you know that? Tell yourself what you want to look like. What is this, Wak? What is this? Aziz, bring her inside. The treatment that I use is the latest technique from space. No one has ever used this technique like me. This person used to be an old woman. Now she's a pretty, young thing. Yes? Are you satisfied? Yes. Where is the money? -How much is it? -A thousand ringgits. That's expensive. Where can I find that amount? If you can't pay, in return, you can be my fourth wife. Aziz, bring her inside. Next! -Why did you ram into my car? -Useless! Are you blind? My car is so big, didn't you see it? You are useless. What-- What? Where are your eyes? On your backside? Do you know who I am? I'm Rosyam Nor. Malaysia's number one hero. One! Wait! Who are you? -Who is this? -You look familiar. -I'm Rosyam Nor. -What? Rosyam Nor? Are you crazy? -Stop pretending. -Your face is like mine. Go home and take a good look at yourself. Understand? Let's go. Get inside. I'll see you in court, Useless. You know. He's so rude. How dare he claim to be Rosyam Nor? Once I beat him up, he'll run away to the hills! Then the whole of Kuala Lumpur can hear him scream. Don't you know? I'm a gangster too. He doesn't know that I'm Castello too. Hold me back! Dear, don't. Be patient. Luckily, you calmed me down. Luckily, you pretty girls are here. There's Laila, Isabella. There's Diana. Dear, let's go. Now. I'm going to take you to a shoot location, okay? Let's go to the filming location of Senario Xx. -Sure. -There are lots of artists there. -Will Chef Wan be there? -But you need to listen to me. When we get there, don't be nice to the crew. They are all playboys. -I agree. -Okay? Goodbye. What do you want? You're already tall, handsome, good-looking, strong. What do you want? As you wish. Where's the money? Hold him. No! Our stock is almost gone. There are only two more left. Find another two people. -Tell the rest to come next week. -Sure. Go. Ugly. Where is the money? -I've already paid. -When? There! Enough, go. Who wants to act in my film? Mr. Mars? The Earthling wishes to speak. Mat Top. How are you? I'm fine! You look more handsome living on Mars. Wak, living on this planet not only enables me to speak and hear, I can sing too. Enough, Mat Top. Remember. You are now a Martian. Don't forget to pray. I need a favor. My stock is almost gone. When can you send some more? What I sent last week is gone? That's okay. Next week, they are taking me to the Planet of the Apes. I will send you some more then. Wait for it!
