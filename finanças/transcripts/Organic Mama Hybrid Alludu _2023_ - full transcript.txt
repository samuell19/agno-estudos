Our special thanks to Mr C Kalyan who cooperated in the making of this movie. [Chuckles] Director Vijay, Hail, hail! Sir! Sir! Excuse me! One second, one second! -Congrats! -Thank you! You made such a great film. Public and media are showering praises for your intelligent screenplay. Thank you! And how could you make two flop films before this? Didn't the music set for those two films? Didn't screenplay set right? Was story itself not good? What do you feel? I wish to enjoy this success first. But, how are you able to enjoy success today after giving two bad films to public? What is your response on this, sir? Reason for this film's great success today is the hard work of my unit. Oh, so you haven't worked hard. I too am a part of the unit, right sir? So, didn't you all not work hard for the films before? We work hard the same way for every film. Oh, then how did you get two flops? How did you get a hit now? So, will success and flop not be in your hands? What are these press people, God? -Did you get the same dream again? -Yes, dad! -Did you dream film to be a sensational hit? -Yes, the same! Two chances have evaporated and who'll give chance now for third film? He started early in the morning. These are called as day dreams. They are the lamps glowing in the bright Sun. There's no use to any one from these. Added is a waste of current. Huh, he will never change. Two producers have gone bankrupt because of you. Good that we had no money. Or else, you'd made even us go bankrupt. When will you realise and start thinking being on the ground? Our lives doesn't run unless we sweat hard. Think practical! Nonsense! Hey! Why are you leaving when I'm talking? Son, hard work fetches food and not the dreams. You made two flops unable to understand such a small point. I'm being silent like this as I had flops. Or else, will you celebrate? So, shall I prepare fish curry then? Huh, you have no common sense at all and are torturing the public. He does by making films and you do by uploading your fish curry in YouTube. Damn! I'm frustrated now waiting for him to work hard so that I can sit at peace and have food. This is the same frustration. Son, I feel like being pierced at heart to death by looking at those dolls. -No festivals or carnivals! -I understand your frustration. -Those dolls should be sold, right? -It is not so easy. -That's for you and not me. -So, what will you do? I'll have my screenplay, right? [Cell phone rings] Crap, nonsense early in the morning! -Hello! -Hey, where are you? -On the cot! -Didn't you still wake up? What shall I wake up and do? My dad said what to do. I'll tell you that, wake up and start. -Can I see your ID proof, ma'am. -Sure, just a moment! Ok ma'am, the room is available. Your room is 216. -Oh, great! -You can go there. -Thanks! -This is your card. Thank you ma'am. Welcome! Do you have a Kondapalli dolls stall? Excuse me sir, exactly what? Wooden dolls, polished and furnished, handcrafted! -Sorry sir, I don't know. -Oh my God, what a pity! It is a hand sculptured wooden doll, made out of sheer polish and furnished and sheer pleasure in integrity and heritage. You have a bakery, you have a stationary. You even have jewellery. But you don't have a Kondapalli dolls stall. I too heard of that, sir. But, I didn't concentrate. It is ok, I can't stay in such a hotel. -Sir! -No, sorry! Please! -Someone asked even yesterday, sir. -Oh, ok! -Excuse me! -Hello sir! -Yeah! Can I meet Mr. Ramesh? -Sure! -Somebody came to meet you, sir. -Send him! -Ok sir! -Please go there. -Yeah, thank you! -Hi sir! -Hi! I came from Jelcon art glow Company. We produce different kinds of wooden sculptures from Kondapalli. It is an oldest Indian tradition of art. Just have a look on it, sir. It is better than Barbie kind of stuff. It is a girl sculpture made of wood. More demand and less availability! Because only Kondapalli people and that too some experts can do it, sir. Few customers had enquired just before. Oh my God! See, that's the craze of Kondapalli. Added, we can involve customers in it sir. -How? -Let me explain. We get few dolls painted for face by experts. Coming to dresses, it can be shirt and dhoti, half saree and blouse or a sari. But, what if they can select their colours and paint themselves? Excellent, very good idea. I too liked this a lot. Oh, thank you sir! Coming to monetary terms, shall we make it 50-50 sir? -Including GST, is it ok for you sir? -Sure! Our hotel gets a good name and even customers will be happy seeing those Kondapalli dolls. -When shall we start, sir? -Immediately! Ok sir! [Narrator] 'That is our hero. Coming to our heroine Hasini, she is straight forward.' 'Hasini's mother is Shakunthala.' 'She isn't tensed even for any tough problems.' 'She waits for the logic.' 'She uses words like spears once she gets a grip and turns the matter in her favour.' 'Hasini's father is Venkata Ramana.' 'He is a big landlord growing organic crops in 100 acres.' 'Venkata Ramana has the habit of smoking a cigar too.' 'But is now inhaling and getting satisfied as he doesn't have the chance to smoke.' [Inhaling deeply] 'Problems do come when in a family.' 'As and when problems arise, he gets into home theatre,' 'closes the door with a bang and sits there.' 'A problem has come up now.' 'Wife Shakunthala came in to tackle that problem.' What did she ask? She asked to study well and to send her to college. -Yes, the same. No need. -She says to help you a lot, right? No need! I don't need her help. Fine, if this continues. I need nothing more. I don't see anything wrong in what she asked, husband. I feel it. Any children would go stubborn when asked to study. But when she wants to study, you should encourage and instead why are you stubborn, husband? -You are crazy! -Yes, I'm crazy. I'm crazy about her. It is because I brought her up carrying on these shoulders. -Then, why don't you say yes? -No, I don't like it. Husband, what's your objection in sending her to PG? It won't stop with that. It goes on with friends, parties and pubs. What if she falls in love with some guy and says can't live without him and would live or die only with him? What if she says to elope with him if we say no? -Is that your fear? -Yes! Look husband, she's the girl whom I fed and whom you carried on your shoulders. She's the good girl we brought up, husband. She wouldn't do such things even by mistake. She's a kid only when in the house and not after seeing the whole world. Believe me and listen to me, husband. You don't worry and don't make her feel sad with unnecessary fears. [Sighs] Can you assure that she wouldn't fall in love with anyone? I'll definitely assure. That's my trust on her. She'd never ruin that. -So, you guarantee me. -Yes, I guarantee! Fine, then as you wish. You say that to her. She'd feel happy. Ok, let's go. -Daddy! -Hah, your mom will say. Mom! -He agreed. -Wow, I love you mom. Thank you, mom! -That was out of the world. -Thanks Hasini for a great party. -Very nice! -That's ok! It's really fine. Hey, some Kondaplaii dolls exhibition is happening there. Hey, babe is superb. Let's not let go her. Hey. They are in full swing. Don't let them slip away. Great matter would miss if we miss her, dude. Hey mister, this is a family hotel and you can't do such things. So, is it ok outside? I'll have to give a Police complaint if you act crazy. -Hey, call the Police. -Ok sir! Sir, why trouble for you? We'll leave from here. Guys, let's go. What's that idiot? Nose in eye's place and eye in place of nose! Is this it? How should we give life into a doll? The spectators should go spellbound. Customers should feel their life is waste if they don't buy after seeing a doll. -That is the talent. -Well said, Mr. Venkat Rao. Greetings sir, you gave us this contract and it seems to work out great. This is five star hotel and it's power is so. -Even the price is similar. -Go on! Thank you, sir. -Shall I prepare fish curry then? -Go on! -Do that after going home. -Oh no, my bad! It is very rare piece, madam. One and only piece! There are no other pieces ditto like this. It is pure handmade, madam. -Oh my God, it is so sweet. -Yeah! Yeah, it is very sweet madam. Like you know Gulab jamun and Rasgulla. Those you can eat with your mouth. But these, you can eat with your eyes. -Nice! -Yes, eyes! It is so nice, beautiful. What are those? Those are unfinished other items, madam. -Other, not this! -Oh, ok! -Ok! -This is only one piece. One piece. It is made by Mr. V Rao. He is very expert, madam. What V Rao, idiot? It is Venkat Rao. -Venkat Rao! -Oh, Venkat Rao! Nice. That guy! -How much? -Ma'am, it is just 14,999 plus GST. Ok, I'll go to my room and then come back with my Credit card. Thank you! -Won't you take? -What? -Nothing! -You go and get the credit card. -Thank you! Is she going to buy or not? Will she come back or not? Here, you take this. -Those dolls are beautiful, right? -Yes! Let's go and see. -Ok, move. -Come! Excuse me! Is there another such rare piece? Hey, give the keys. Here! This feels sweeter than Rasgulla and Gulab Jamun to my eye. We should do that type of a magic in business, madam. -Even your people covered greatly. -By covering cloth on those dolls, right? -My people have great timing. -Yes, you too have a good spark. Thank you, madam. -Pack that only one rare piece for me. -Ok! Hey, pack it. You didn't ask for the price. 14,999 plus GST! -So, you've seen the whole film. -Yes! Pack even that soldier doll for me after this. -Soldier! -Yes! -Sir! -Hah! Hasini, let's go to exhibition after the movie. Oh no, I can't be till then. I should be home after the film. Dad will get angry if I'm not home by 5:30. -Baby! -[Crowd making noise] -Hey chocolate! -[Crowd making noise] -Hey cutie! -Come fast! -Let's join with them. -Hey, wait! -[Car alarm chirps] -Hey, what's this? -Don't fear! -Hey! -Hey, what's your problem? -Hey! -Oh no! Hey, are you mad? What the hell? -Hey! -Hasini! -Let us go! -Lucky! Please leave us, please! [Gasps] [Rap lines] Move man! Are you fine? Nothing happened to you, right? -Hasini, are you ok? -I'm ok, fine! -Yeah, we're fine. Are you good? -Yeah, I'm ok. Please take. You forgot this soldier from the dolls you bought. I came to give you this. Thanks a lot, you came at the right time and helped. Oh no, this is not a help but service after sale. A guy saving is the army for a girl. You first wipe it. -Oh no, why all this now? -Service after service! [Praises of Lord Krishna] [Music] "Hey beauty of Allasani, why is this song?" "Hey soldier safeguarding me, this is for you." "Did you fall in love like the nectar in flower?" "Did you ask by knowing like the sweetness of nectar?" "Hey Kondapalli doll in my heart, don't go away from my heart" "Day for the white colour to be gone from jasmine will never come" "Hey beauty of Allasani, this word is enough" "Hey soldier safeguarding me, I'm with you now." [Music] I feel like to prepare fish curry by seeing that couple. Don't get into dirty greed, you know who is that girl? Who? She is organic Venkata Ramana sir's daughter. -Oh! -Even your son is gone on you. Me? He day dreams like film is hit and you dream to get a rich girl. -Dirty day dreams! -Oh! -First concentrate on dolls and look into the work. -Ok! Colour properly, idiot. Or else I'll cut you into pieces and cook the curry. Why do you say him? Look into that work first. -No, please! -Please, have it. "I will do anything if you are with me" "I'll sail the seas even with a paper boat" "Hey colourful moon, how are you born?" "You are a wonder far above all the seven wonders" "Even the gun in soldier's hand didn't fire like this" "Heart is drenched and flew so with the attack of your words bullets" "Hey beauty of Allasani, that heart is enough" "Hey soldier safeguarding me, this life is for you" [Music] -I think they are deep in love. -Any doubt? I confirmed long back. -Are you ok? -It is ok, I'm fine. -Fine now? -Yeah, I'm ok fine! "It is enough that your hand falls on my flowery shirt" "Flowers drawn in lines will fill life and flourish" "Whatever earth rotates, it is towards the Sun" "How much ever stopped love steps ahead towards you" "You've seen love in the guy selling dolls" "This small place in your heart is equal to a vast kingdom for me" "Hey soldier safeguarding me, I'm your queen" "Hey beauty of Allasani, I'm your King now" "Shall we be together like the nectar in flower?" "Shall we become united like the sweetness of nectar?" "Kondapalli doll from the heart, will never go away from you" "You said the word to fill my heart, it is a celebration now for me" "Hey soldier safeguarding me, this word is enough" "Hey beauty of Allasani, I'm with you now" -Hi Hasini! -Hi! -Hey, you look cool. -So, what happened? -We just met, right? Come, I'll tell. -Let's go! -Yeah! -Yeah! Ok! -Pack it fast, I got to deliver. -Ok sir! -Hey, where are the dolls? -Hi! I sold them off. There is the sold out board. What? Did so many came and bought the dolls? No, film hero Venkat and his wife came and bought them. Understood, you said 90% discount if bought in bulk, right? No, I sold at original price including GST. What, did they come to buy all the dolls? -No, they just came to see. -Ok, came for seeing! -Excuse me! -Yes! -Sir, you are hero Venkat right? -Yeah! Sir, please see! I got the scape goat, I shouldn't let go. Sir, see this. -It is very good. -It is very pleasant to see. You like it and I like you liking it so. Take it for free. Oh no, we don't need so. Say it's cost. It is 99, 999 plus GST. Still, how can I take money from you sir. -No need of money. -No, only if you say to take the bill. But sir, how would it be if there is a horse riding team to show the way when this travels, sir? It is good, but only if you say to charge. Actually we constructed a new house and it is completely empty. We were thinking what to do and saw your dolls. -We just came to see and liked by seeing them. -Yes! And we wanted to buy them, but only if you say to charge! Oh no, let's look into that later sir. But sir, there's a girl to ride this vehicle. How would it be if there's a cute couple, a boy and girl instead of this girl, sir? -That is like you and me. -Exactly like you both. How would it be if we now put the wedding attire like this to those dolls, sir? -That's like those days we were newly married. -Yeah! Super, man! Your concept is great. You gave a shape to sweet memories and gave them a life. Thank you, sir. We also need some public if it is a marriage, right sir? -Yes! -What if we have public behind the cart and band in front? -Yes, we need. One minute, sir! Sir, we need a temple close by to the place this batch is going for the wedding, right sir? Excellent, you gave a great nativity touch. It is great, fantastic! You must have been a film director in your previous life. Sir! Thank you, sir! For the wedding, we need stage, relatives, priests, band team, workers and... Yes, we need everyone. Do one thing, give all these dolls. -We'll set the entire house. -All the dolls! -Everything! -Ok sir! Thank you sir, thank you! Hey pack them, pack fast! I sold off everything in a shot. [Snaps finger] Hey, why did you go stiff like that? -I felt it would've been so good if I bought them all. -Oh no! -Namaste madam! -Namaste! Where is film director Vijay around here? -He is there. -One minute! It is me and you are... My name is Munikonda and surname is Anakonda. I'm a film producer. I came to plan a film with you. -Is it, sir? Wow, you made great films. Two films are master pieces without any connection to each other. -Individual stories and individual concepts! -Oh! Both of them are like whistle blowers, that's it. I felt one must see only such films. I did, but no use. A film is only what the public likes. Don't say so dear, satisfaction is important. Satisfaction for you by making them and satisfaction for us by seeing them. A light came then in my heart. I shouldn't stop just by seeing and feeling happy. I came to make a master piece only with you. I also took an office, Say a story urgently and we shall start it tomorrow itself. Oh! Let's look into the story and all in your office, sir. -Then come on, let's go in my car. -So fast? Bye! -Come on! -Bye! Bye! Step in with your right foot first. -Namaste sir! -Namaste! -Namaste sir! -Namaste! -Good afternoon, sir! -Same from me too. -That one is my room, come on. -Oh, is it sir? -Come, sit there. -Ok, sir! Look, coffee is good here and tea is good nearby. Cool drink is good anywhere. It will be further better if selection is yours. Sir, you have a good hold on cinema language. I grew watching films from childhood. -I'm crazy about films and thus got that language by heart. -Oh! -You didn't say what you need? -Oh no, I need nothing sir. Look, have we come for any marriage matches not to have anything? Hey Govind, order two coffee! -One minute! -Yes! Where is this fellow? -Why are you here, come inside. -You didn't say and thus... Doctor informed you too, right? Yes sir, you got sugar and if sugar is down because of cinema tension, he asked to give you this chocolate. -You should be with me to give, right? -Yes! How can you give if you stay here? -You first go and order for two coffee, -Ok sir! -Just be with me. -Ok! -Hey! -Sir! -What should you do? -Be with you! -Yes! -Yes, sir! Ok say now, what is the story of the film we are going to make? -That is... -What do you mean? We need a hero first to make a movie, right sir? Yes, a hero for movie is as important as handle for an umbrella and oil for a lamp. Exactly sir, I too was saying exactly the same. -And thus... -And thus? Say, what is the problem? After narrating story to hero and get his acceptance... -You'd say then? -Yes! Great, no problem. Do the same. You made two great films. It may be any hero, he should be readily accepting. -Do the same. -Sir, which range hero do we need now? We shall go to any hero your story demands and pay whatever he demands. If needed, let's give extra. We have no problem in that matter. We don't need to back step about budget and no need to hesitate at all. I got perfectly ready and came in. Ok sir, I'll call the hero, fix date and time and then call you. -Ok do it, make it fast. All the best! -Ok sir, thank you! -Namaste madam! -He is producer, Mr. Munikinda. -Surname is Anakonda. -My name is Vijay, madam. -We came to narrate story to Hero sir. -Please come and sit inside. -I'll go inform sir. -Come on! Come, sir! -Sir is calling, please go in. -Ok! Screenplay is a must here. Sir, if you don't mind I'll first go and narrate story to hero and you can then meet him. No problem, you go and narrate. I'll sit right here. -It is important that job is done for us. -Yes! -All the best! -Yeah! [Clock ticking] No idea if he impresses him or depresses. -Producer sir... -Me, it is me dear. What a director, sir? What a story? I have never heard to such a story in my life. Maybe I will not listen even in my future. Story is so good, sir. Wow, yours is a great story selection, sir. Thank you, dear. Ultimate, sir! To be true, no words after listening to this story. -Wow, this story is so good sir. -Is it? -Thank you! -Super, fantastic! -Thank you, sir. I fell down right there seeing his excitement after listening to the story, sir. I haven't seen such a hero anywhere in my life, sir. -Stop it, it is too much. -Wow, what a grasping? Sir, that flow came automatically while narrating the story by seeing that grasping. -Yes! -He's praising me too much. It is a super hit when hero liked. Say when do you need dates from, uncle? -Hey, uncle? -Yes, uncle! Once we met, it shouldn't be like you are the producer and I'm the hero. We all are a family, all our concentration should be on the success. -I feel that way. -We too are of the same type, dear. Here, this is just an advance for you. All the rest as per what you say time to time. Oh no, what was the hurry for this now, uncle? We still have the time, Story is important for us. That is set and coming to success, it is there in the story our guy has written. -I could visualise it as it is. -This is for my satisfaction, dear. -Huh! -It is a sentiment, dear. When Goddess Lakshmi knocks on our door, we should open the door but shouldn't push away. -That's the reason, dear. -Uncle! -What dear? -Let it be so as you are saying. -Yes! -I like you a lot, dear. We are all a family from now. -Ok, fine! -See you, dear. -Fine! Let's leave fast. He may change his mind again. -I'll take leave, sir. -Ok bye! Hero is so sharp. Your selection is superb, director. He liked your story and also the character. He stayed back right in his character. I liked your selection a lot. Oh no! -Here, have this cheque first. -Oh no, why so fast sir? Hero sir said we are all a family, right? Thus keep this cheque in your pocket. Ok, I'll take as you are stressing sir. -Thank you, sir! -Ok! Story stuck so much to hero sir, means the film is a big blockbuster. -Yes sir! -Fine, but what is that story? I'll tell, sir. How can I not say that to you? But, I'd get a bit of confidence after narrating to even the heroine, sir. -I'll then tell, sir. -Ok, you'll at least say later right? -Definitely! -Let it be so. -You are asked to come in. -Ok! -I can't avoid the screenplay again. -What? Sir, I narrated story alone to hero and it worked out well sentimentally. Who knows, it may work out the same even here. Sentiments are like peppermints in film industry. I too follow them. -You go and narrate. -Thank you sir, you understood me well. I like soap and milk giving a foam. I see that foam in your words. -Hey, a punch again? -Oh, thank you! -Sir, I'll go and narrate. -Ok, all the best! -Thank you, sir! [Clock ticking] Heroine should come as per sentiment, right? Why did you come? Did sentiment not work? What actually happened? -Did she listen to the story? -She heard. She got involved and a bang sound came in between. Why did the sound come in between? -She fell on ground. -Why did she fall? -As she heard the story. -Will she fall by listening? -Sound came as she fell, sir. -What happened then? -Then she flapped badly, sir. -Did you leave her so and came out? No sir, I came out after she got a bit better. -She got better, right? -Yes! Did she like our story? How can I say that, sir? She should say. -She should come to say, right? -There, she comes. -She's here. -Producer sir! -It is me! -Wow, what a story sir? I haven't even thought in dreams for such a story to exist. Wow, beautiful, glorious, tremendous, fantastic! -So, you liked the story, right baby? -Not just simply! -Mind blasting, sir. -Take it out fast, man. Sir, you didn't get an ordinary story. You brought a story changing my fate. -Her is the advance and the rest as you say. -No sir! This is a film I got to do even for free. Story is like that. I'm high on sentiments, please take for my sake. -No problem, take madam. -Fine, as you are forcing so much. -Thanks baby, we'll take leave. -See you, madam. Come, let's leave before baby's mood changes. Wow! Director liked, hero liked and heroine liked the story. -Thus she fell on ground and flapped out. -Sir! -Why are you talking to yourself, sir? -Wow! What an involvement and what an excitement? I decided to make a film with you and you made me stand high on top. -Source for all this is that story. -Yes sir! By the way, what is that story? Sir, bad time has arrived. opening is nearby and we shall discuss then, sir. It will also work out well even as a sentiment. Oh no, sentiment always works. We can listen to our story anytime. Like, we can wear our hat whenever we want. Wow, what a phrase sir? Chamba! What is Chamba? No, if it is this. -Hey, I must tell you a good news. -What? -I got film direction chance. -Congratulations! -Thank you! -I'm so happy for you. -Thank you so much. -I'm really very happy. -Fine, when is it starting? -We shall plan now on. -Oh! Hey Sunny, that guy fighting us at the five star hotel is here along with that babe. I'm sharing you the location. Come immediately. Enough, stop now. Your confidence is high on me and that's too much. There, they are. Move, guys! Come on, fast! -Really? -Yes, you too know right? -Oh no! -Huh! You displayed heroism that day at the hotel, right? Show it now, idiot. You overacted with few girls around, right? Come on, show it now. You go around with the girl we eyed on? Best alternative, give her to us and leave from here. Looks like chocolate baby is in to sweating. [Laughs] Go! Take her, brother. Take her brother, take her. Take her brother, take her. Brother, you take her. Take her. Hey go, they will take you. Take her brother, Take her, idiot. Take her. Vijay! Vijay! Leave me. Vijay! Leave me. Vijay! -Come on, man. Start the vehicle. -Start the vehicle, man. -Drive it fast, come on. -Move, fast. There's no waste fellow here. My calculation is different. Huh! Let's go. All have to be in the same size. Watch carefully. Make it fast. We are getting late. -Namaste sir! -What? Oh no, big manager! Why did you come, sir? Is there any complaint on our vegetables? Not just me sir, none others would dare to complain about your vegetables. -Our procurement manager went on a leave. -Oh! I came as I could meet you and discuss about our requirement. I'm very happy, please come. Let's sit and talk. Please come! -Please sit. -Thank you! Come and sit. -[Inhaling deeply] -Health conscious! -Ramu! -Sir! What drink is this, sir? It is so fantastic. Banana leaf juice, it is good for both appetite and digestion. -I recently made that. -You are super, sir. Whatever you invent is fresh and fantastic. Can we use this as welcome drink in our hotel, sir? -Definitely! -Thank you so much, sir. Your acceptance is a great honour to our hotel, sir. Sir, who is that girl in the photo? She came to our hotel many times. -For what? -To buy Kondapalli dolls. Yes! When still childish at heart, such dolls pull her like a magnet. It wasn't the dolls pulling like magnet sir, but the guy selling those dolls. -What do you mean? -We are all aware of love in that age, sir. We've crossed over that age and don't we know that, sir? They both are in deep love. By the way, who is that girl sir? -My daughter, Hasini! -Jump! -Sir! -Damn, start the vehicle. -Sir! [Music] "So many jasmines in the autumn" "Your company has shown so many wonders" "Like the star in darkness" "You met me like this" "Like the dream of early morning" "Like the tide falling over for the first time" "You came and landed like the sky on earth" [Vocables] "So many jasmines in the autumn" "Your company has shown so many wonders" [Music] "You know, if my shadow had a body" "You know, it is none other than me" "I am you" "You are me" "Without you" "I don't exist" "None can separate the tide from a sea" [Vocables] "So many jasmines in the autumn" "Your company has shown so many wonders" [Music] "You know, if my heart had a name" "You know, it is none other than mine" "Yours is the voice" "Mine is the lip" "Not stopping even for a minute" "Let the journey continue" "Whatever may happen, the fish never leaves the water" [Vocables] "So many jasmines in the autumn" "Your company has shown so many wonders" "The Autumn..." Husband, what is this? Please stop. Oh no! -What actually happened, husband? -She broke my trust. -She broke my heart. -What happened, husband? It seems your daughter is in love with someone. -Who said? -Known people! Is our affection of so many years gone and someone's words said in ten minutes have dominated? Those seeing with their eyes have said that clearly. You believed it and are breaking everything you come across. What to do? What shall I do? My BP is not in my control. My blood sugar levels are out of my control. Problems in your body are making you lose control and not your daughter brought up with affection. She is the reason for all this, right? Then, you should think with love and not in rage, right? -So, what to do? -You should wait and ask. You must find the truth by asking her. Ask and find out! Let's talk after you know them. [Door slams] Why are all these fallen down like this, mom? Your father broke them with his anger on you. He can't say anything to you, right? -What have I done, mom? -It seems, you loved someone? A truth shows the way of life. A lie gives us pain for the entire life. I won't ask you to say the truth. I'll ask you to say what you wish to. But, remember one thing Hasini. Whatever you say now is your future. What father said is true. [Door slams] How dare are you to push the door and come in like that? -You have no fear about me. -No, husband! -Why not? -Fear doesn't exist when there's love. Not any three day fun, but ours is a family since 25 years. So, you do as per your wish? Why would I come in if I do as I wish? -Then, why did you come? -To ask. -What's there to ask? -Fine, to tell. Say! You said, she's a girl brought up carrying over shoulders. You said, she's girl whom you fed. She jumped down from my shoulders and spit out your food. She made my fear come true. Tell what you wish to say now. You gave the word and you must give the answer for this. -Will you listen patiently? -I'm listening, right? When parents love their kid, they don't ask and love. She wouldn't know it is love, when she is growing in our hands. Love in real, doesn't be in anyone's hands, husband. That is a wonderful feeling. We should feel while bringing up. We must teach when she is growing. She learnt and thus she fell in love. So, was it my mistake to love her so much? She said the truth as it is not a mistake. We are having to think patiently as she said the truth. -So, should we accept? -We shouldn't accept. -Then what? -We should find out. -What to find? -We should find who he is. We should find about his family. We should find everything about them. [Chants] -All the best! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you sir! All the best! [Chants continuing] [Gasps] Here! -Go on! -No! -Roll camera! -Rolling! Clap! Munikonda productions, Dundubhi! All the best! Action! I'd say anything only for once. No repeat if not heard. -Only close your account! -Cut, ok! -Hey, who are you? -Why didn't your parents come? If I call, dad will go directly go to producer and ask if he got ready to go bankrupt in my hands. Would he say so bad? I somehow got a producer finally. Should I lose him too from hands? -Thus, I didn't tell. -It'd come in social media and newspapers. Then what? -He doesn't read paper. -Oh, anti-social like me! Go and look into your work. Hey Raju, put those juniors in background. -Sir, Mr. Venkat Rao here... -It is me. Sir, I'm Organic Venkata Ramana sir's driver. -He invited you both husband and wife to his house, sir. -What? -For what? -I don't know why. But based on madam's words, I understood it is to fix your son's match with our sir's daughter. Madam asked you not to mistake them for asking you both to come. They also gave this card. They informed to send car if you call the number on this card. Oh no, why to send a car. Card is given and we will come down. -Ok sir, I'll take leave. -Ok! -Hey, you are very lucky. -My cute boy! -First go and get ready, it's a big match. -Yes! -It doesn't look if we go empty handed. -Shall I prepare fish curry? No need, don't pester me. Then, what do we have than those Kondapalli dolls? Well reminded, those brought them together and got them united now. I never looked at it like a doll, but saw it like mom feeding me. We shall give the same and it'd take good care being in their house. -What more do we need than this? -Yes, yes! Keep chatting so and waste the time. -Go and get ready fast. -Ok! Which way should I go? I'll go this way. Hey, who are you? -Hey, who allowed them in? Send them out. -Ok sir! Husband! Husband, they are parents of the boy. Fine then, you leave. Be seated. Sit up, up! [Inhaling deeply] Please tell! My name is Venkat Rao, sir. She is my wife Seethamma. You are a great man and are aware of everything. There would be none in this area not knowing about you, sir. And when you called us to talk about your daughter's marriage, we came running floated with happiness, sir. What more luck can we have than to be your in-laws, sir? We brought this doll for you, sir. -What do you do? -I prepare fish curry, sir. Hey, be quiet. Here sir, we make such Kondapalli dolls. -You make and... -Sell them, sir. That's our profession. -Oh! -My wife helps me in my work. She does colouring and finishing touches to make them beautiful, sir. In her free time, she cooks fish curry, prawn fry, crab roast and others tastily and shows them on some YouTube, sir. She thus said that, sir. She is a specialist in cooking fish curry. -Fine, what does your son do? -He does film direction. He is a very clever boy. Not to say as my son, but he has no bad habits at all. He never sits free. He keeps writing something whenever he finds time. -That is his world, sir. -Huh! [Door slams] Kondapalli dolls for sale! Shaking dolls and pulling dolls! Dolls of boy and girl! What's he my in law? Why did she get me such a link? This will never get set. He makes dolls with wood and his wife colors them. They don't get food to eat unless the dolls get sold. What's such a guy being my in law? I'm landlord owning 100 acres. I'm organic Venkata Ramana. Our family has such a great name and what's to get into a relation with such people? -Fish curry! Small fish, large fish, crabs and prawns! -Oh no! What's she my in law? I'm feeling embarrassed just by imagining. She makes fish curry, it seems. Fish curry! -I too make it as you like that. -There's difference in you both. Both are the fish and both are the curries. She is sharing her talent to all through YouTube. What's wrong? If a chef of a five star hotel does the same, they say great. When some big hero does it, they say wow and give likes. They upload the same again in the same YouTube channel. You have money and a greater wealth than that. And thus when you cultivate organic crops, that is great. When a poor farmer does the same, they show pity at him saying he is working hard for food. Whatever, profession is based on their stamina. Income is based on the profession and differences are based on the income. We shouldn't be looking at the differences, husband. Love and affection! When should they have them both? They'd have long flown with air in their financial troubles. I've invited them here for you to find if they have them or not. -What did you do? Just got up and came here. -Huh! Come with me. [Inhaling deeply] I like to smoke a cigar a lot. My daughter was very small then. -Daddy! -Baby! Daddy, don't smoke the cigar. It is smelling bad, no! -No! -No! I'll quit if you say. -Fine for you? -Yes! I quit smoking cigars from then. I'm adjusting by smelling like this to memorize the olden days. This is the first swing we gave a ride for my daughter. I too will travel back into those days by seeing this. This is the bicycle with tiny wheels she first rode when she was growing. I felt so happy and overwhelmed when she used to ride this bicycle. Hey, Hasini. [Laughs] This is the bicycle my daughter learnt for the first time. I was so afraid she may get hurt by falling down. But she didn't fall. I arranged four guys to take care. They used to run along with the bicycle. -Why are you seeing? Come on, follow. -Slowly! Husband, you wait! -Yes, I can ride a bicycle now. -She learnt. After she learnt this bicycle well... -Baby! -Huh! -Why is she angry? -She wants a Scooty. [Gasps] -So fast? -Then, when? After some four to five years. She'd just sit like this till then, is it ok? She'd just sit like this till then, is it ok? Oh no, how can she be so? Thus, we should give when she wants and not after she lost interest. Be careful with this vehicle, dear. Here, this is starter. -If you slowly rise by holding this... -Oh no, I know it daddy. No dear, I'll have my fear. Guys, be careful. -Yes, start it. -Start! -Yes! -Oh no! -Oh no! She went in speed without the running guys being able to catch, she fell down. She also got fever. I was so worried. I thought to throw this out. But Shakunthala didn't agree. She said even the sorrow experienced should be remembered along with the happiness. I said ok and let this be. After that, I bought all the cars she asked for. I like every car she uses. When I bought a doll and gave her, I can't forget that cute smile of happiness till today. Do you have the capacity to take care of that cute smile not to be gone away? -We don't have, sir. -No problem, I have that. Does your son at least have the capability to run that? -Move, dear. -Ok! -See you, sir! -We'll take leave, sir. -All the artistes are ready. Keep the shot fast. -Sir! -Ok sir! -Ok, right! -Vijay, I got to talk with you. -What, dude? You don't mistake me, right? You're a frankly speaking friend. Say without hesitating. I won't mistake you. -All are talking bad about our film. -What are they saying? He doesn't know how to make films and already has given two flops. They are saying you've again caught an innocent producer and managing. Hey, such talks would ignite fire in a person. We should enhance our quality ourselves and write our own future. We should work had every second for that. It can be this field or any other field. Thus, you should first believe in yourself and me in myself. Every person should believe in themselves. "Believe, come on believe in yourself "Your dream will come true" "Cross over the fire or the pain" "No problem even if you fall down" "Power of the guy standing back after a back step is different" "Move ahead, work hard and reach your goal" [Vocables] "Believe, come on believe in yourself" "Your dream will come true" "Cross over the fire or the pain" -"No problem even if you fall down" -Action! [Vocables] [Music] Take okay. "Come on, gather all your power" "Break down all the walls of laziness" "Be stubborn and strain yourself" "Turn the sweat drops as steps to the skies" "Don't bend when there's a problem" "Don't stop thinking it is the fate" "You are no less, don't go down" "Don't let go hopes till you win" "You can't reach the sky without anxiety" [Vocables] Okay take. "Believe, come on believe in yourself" "Your dream will come true" -"Cross over the fire or the pain" -Okay, okay. -"No problem even if you fall down" -Shot okay. [Vocables] [Music] -Action. -"Why do we have the birth?" "It is to make your mark on the earth" "There is full of energy in you" "It is to write your name in history" "Respect your own war" -"Let the capability reach peaks" -Yes. That's! -"Let the world listen to your sound" -Come on. -"Move ahead crossing over the silence" -Yes! Superb! "No victory comes to you in easy ways" [Vocables] -Action. -"Believe, come on believe in yourself" "Your dream will come true" -"Cross over the fire or the pain" -Yes. -"No problem even if you fall down" -One more. The dust hasn't stirred up. [Vocables] Look man, you narrated hero and didn't say to me. You narrated to the heroine and didn't say to me. We started our film and broke the coconut. You didn't tell even after that. We've now completed the film and broken the pumpkin. Will you at least tell now? What is our film story? -Definitely sir. Hey Ramu, come here. -I'm coming. -Give me that file. -Here! Sir, entire story is in this. All scenes we shot till date are clearly in an order. -Go home and read it happily. -Ok, I'll read and come back. -Where is he? -Where did he vanish? Why did he vanish so? [Yawning] Oh no, why did he come home early in the morning? Sir, please come in. -No problem! -Why did you come so early, sir? Have you read it completely, sir? So, you know the entire story. -Where is the story in this? -You read the whole file, right sir? -Didn't you know what's the story? -No! Copy will anyways be ready soon. You'd know the story then by watching it. -Ok man, see you. -Fine sir! Fine it seems, come on. [Engine starts] See this, mom. Another chance coming to a director giving two flop films. They say talent never fails. This is said to be the chance coming in search. Not enough to get a chance, should also possess capability to utilise that. Chance came as it was there. His dad himself agreed not to have that and left from here. Look, you can just see 'chance' in that paper. I see 'director with two flops'. I took a big step ahead as your mom said. What would be there if I go further ahead? It'll all be darkness. I was into a trance till now to be a special father. But you opened up my eyes, showing me to be a routine father and to do routine deeds. Go and get ready. A match is arriving to see you. -Mummy, daddy! Follow me. -Namaste brother in law, please come. -To be father in law and mother in law! -Correct! Come on, let's talk inside. -Namaste brother in law! -Namaste brother in law! -Please come, be seated. -You be seated. -Nice house! -No idea how is the girl. An iPhone in front of me? -Take coffee, son. -Thank you, mother in law. Thank you! Oh no! Shall I say? No need, they'll know after the marriage about our son's talent. -Daddy! -Won't you leave even this? It's good, right? Why are you still standing? Go and get the girl. Ok husband! She's coming. Does anybody have this habit in your house? Your dad has it, right? -Come and sit, dear. -Ok for me. -Girl should say that. -I'll make her say. Hey, what are you searching for? I forgot where did I keep my phone, husband. You generally don't forget anything so easily? -Is this a comedy? -No, romance! You seem to be talking about something. Why not ask me? You can ask me too. It is nothing. She was saying you may wish to ask the girl anything and is saying to ask, -What do you say? -Yes! -Oh, ask son! -Shall I ask if she can sing? -Not me, ask her. -Ok! -Do you know any songs? -Daddy, routine question! -Ask anything new, son. -That is... -Your hobbies! -Dad, routine question again. Try anything further newly, son. My son generally doesn't try anything new. But he tries the old ones newly. -He just tried something newly and also got a success. -Yes! -We should use homeopathy for him. -I don't understand what you said. We understand it and you too will understand slowly. It is about you. -Do you know cooking and all? -What do you mean all? I mean cooking various dishes. Daddy, all are routine questions. Huh! -Husband, my phone. -Oh no, you must've forgotten somewhere. Let's get that searched after this, just be quiet now. -You are talking something, why don't you ask me? -You can ask me too. Oh no, nothing! It is all confusing. -Ask something newly, son. -Oh, are you still stuck there? -Son, try something new. -Did you get Corona? -Dirty question! -I accept it. Madam, phone! You're done now, idiot! [Mobile ringtone] -My ringtone! -Am I caught? [Chuckles] [Mobile ringing] Husband, my phone! -[Mobile ringing] -Why don't you switch it off? Didn't you say? -What's that? -I thus gave you hint many times to ask me. -Hint? -Yes! -You know my son has great property, right? -What if I know? He also has this small habit along with that. -What's that? -It is his habit to steal something as a memory wherever he goes. Even when comes for events like the marriage looks? Not just this, he won't return without at least a spoon when he goes to even a tea stall. He has the habit of accumulating memoirs. Two rooms have already been filled with his memoirs. What, two rooms already? Not just two rooms, we've now even planned to construct a shed. -Thank you so much, daddy! -It is very much needed. You understood us and we are very happy for that. -You know what is this habit called? -What is it called? -Kleptomania! -Oh! -Hand technique! -My son's hand is lucky. Yes daddy! You shameless thief! Why is there is a change in your talks? These are all my hobbies. What's wrong in it? These are my memoirs, yeah! -Oh no, don't you see anything wrong in this? -No! Hello, it's a memory when called and given and theft if taken without saying. You just know to rob and not to ask and take. -Daddy! -What sir, you call for matches and say us as thieves? Is it wrong saying a thief as thief? I taught her to love and not looting like you. -She too would learn if married. -Damn you! You are not a match even to her foot nail. And how can I get her married to your house? Get out! What do you say me when angry? -I hate you! -Yes! -I hate your family. -I damn your family. -I double damn your family. -I triple damn your family. It may not end at all. Come on, let's go for another match. -Go! -One minute! A family greedy for spoon, they won't match us. Come son! Correct daddy! Huh! [Door slams] Oh no, mom! This isn't the anger but pain. Consolation is needed to bring down anger. Silence is needed for the pain to come down. [Laughs] It happened so. Thank you! -Thank you! -Sir, anything else? -Nothing else, thank you! -Thank you sir! It went fine as he was a thief collecting memoirs. My father suddenly said that people were coming to see me. I was able to escape as it all went like that then. But it doesn't happen so every time. Instead of waiting and to oppose, let's go somewhere and get married, Vijay. Say Vijay, let's do something. Say, what to do? If we first know what not to do, we'll know what to do. -What should we not do? -We shouldn't elope. We shouldn't run away from the situations. Similarly, we shouldn't oppose our own people. What you said is like, we need victory and no war should take place. Yes, war shouldn't take place. But we need a victory. How is that possible Vijay? They say, chances are the mentors to make a path. That means, use every chance you get towards that. How? Once we came to the decision to be together, that decision will lead us. That is our guide and that is our mentor. See, how it guides us. [Mobile ringing] Hello! Is it? -Which hospital? I'm just coming. -What happened? It seems Ramu's father attempted suicide. -Come, I too will join you. -Let's go. -How is he, Doctor? -Fine, you can talk. Uncle! Hey, how did uncle always strong minded go weak at mind like this? Dad always had a dream to construct his own house. He collected every penny and saved one crore rupees for that. He took a loan of five Million outside and bought a site recently with 1.5 crore. He later came to know it was registered on someone else's name along with us. He got to know that he was cheated when he went to register office. When he went to the guy selling the site, he said to have nothing to do with all this and asked him to get lost from there. When he asked to at least return the money, he got him beaten by goons saying why should he return. He lost one crore, the site and is left with five Million loan... and an insult, which led to this. [Sobbing] I couldn't fight the cheaters and lost. I did so as I couldn't stand in shame at the place I took loan. [Crying] Your problem is his problem. His problem is our problem. -Say, what is his name. -Gajula Gangarao. -Company name? -GGR Developers! This is enough. -What shall we do now? -Let's use a mind blocking screenplay. Brother in law! Brother in law! A mediator is here to meet you. It seems, there is a good site for sale. -Did you enquire everything well. -I brought him to you after that. What did you feel? I felt it is a waste if that site isn't bought. What? I mean, there is only one such site for now. -Ok, call him in. -Ok! -Hey Raghu, please come in. -Yes, I'm coming. Namaste sir, my name is Raghu and I'm a real estate broker. I'll come directly to the point without wasting your time. There is a single bit of five acres to the road in Gachibowli to Botanical garden road. One acre normally costs 20 crores and we can set that for about 15 if for us. Why, is it any litigation site? Oh no! There isn't any such litigation and will not come. Because another deal fetching double this profits in Dubai. My owner planned this way as it'd profit everyone if we can find any person who can pay us in cash at once by reducing the price. -He calls this as profit management. -Profit Management? This sounds new. I never heard of it. What, Simham? Profit managements of great people are like this. See, we are saving five crores per acre even before buying it. Never let go this site at any cost, brother in law. Fine man, you are saying so much and I too just understood. -What brother in law? -Profit management! What did you understand, brother in law? It is like milk turning to curd, curd to butter and butter to ghee. See, you got it so fast. Your brain has great grasping power, brother in law. You don't praise me so. I feel like eating a sweet listening to it. It is a jaggery sweet, right brother in law? It'd be so sweet. [Laughs] You go and arrange to show the site. -Ok sir, I'll take leave. -Ok, fine dear. -Brother in law, five crores per acre! -Yes! [Laughs] This is a great deal, man. [Old song playing] Mobile is ringing brother in law, lift it. That isn't any call or a ringtone at all, brother in law. -Then what is it? -You see that? Yes! Yes, it stopped. My son in law is doing research on an advanced technology named machine learning. He came home yesterday. He installed an App as I like listening to songs. -What's that? -This App has a speciality. It selects songs itself based on the mood I'm in and plays and stops when I touch it. -It is great brother in law. -Yes, MP App. -What's that brother in law. -That is Mood Play App. It is all automatic and machine learning. See brother in law, even machine learning is helping us with words. That's wrong brother in law, not words but song. Oh! Brother in law, there's the mile stone number 20. Stop the car. -Sir, you are... -The new MRO. It is just three days since I joined. I expected. Seeing the Government vehicle, I expected you to be MRO sir. Mr. Mohan Rao was there before and you came in his place. Yes! -By the way, you are... -Oh, I didn't tell about myself. Let me tell, brother in law. He is Gajula Gangarao, the real estate king. -Wear your goggles, brother in law. -Oh, ok! I've a big construction company named GGR Developers, sir. Fine, you didn't say the reason you came here. What is there to tell? It seems someone is coming to buy this site. Thus, Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy sir asked to give the correct report. We came for a resurvey for the same. We'll take leave now. See you, sir! Sir, another party is coming to see my site. I'll go there and can you please take care here? Oh no, busy mediators! What, man? Now a days, mediators are keeping busy brother in law. Yes, everyone is busy in their way. -Go! -Shall I go, sir? Go! This land belongs to Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy. -See, his name is shining on the board. -Yes, brother in law. -King and emperor are in name. -There's even money, brother in law. There's no wastage in name, it is very tight. Sir is here, sir is here. Sir, please come in. -Site has great charm. -Even margin is similar, brother in law. Look at those plants. Garden is so beautiful, brother in law. -Sir, please! -I directly called you just now. Yes sir! Please sir! See his respect, obedience and affection. -I see love, he's like that. -Yes, brother in law. Sir, please! My master Gundam Gurnatham said we should appreciate good in anybody. That great man has left as he couldn't adjust on the earth. -Did he go by himself, brother in law? -No satires! If you do such things, I'll remove you and keep him in job. -No need, brother in law. -Sir! Oh no! Brother in law, why would Chakravarthy sir let go a guy with such respect? Brother in law, what happened? Get up, brother in law. What's wrong? I thought he fell on my feet. Did he get unconscious? What happened? My brother in law falls unconscious when he is happy. What to do now? -I have an idea. -What is that? -Wild pig entered the garden. -Where, where is the wild pig? -Where is the wild pig? -Oh no! -Wild pig, where is it? -What is this guy? Sir! If you keep him in job, then you should scream wild pig entered the garden. You shut up. -Sorry sir! -What's this, man? -That pig and garden... -Sir, please! -Hey, stop! One is from Andhra and the other is Telangana, what's the story? -It is love, sir. -Did you get married? -Is it done? -It's like done, sir. -What's that, brother in law? -What's that? It is not so for us, sir. We say a word and get together in a garden. From then we are on same word and in same garden. After that, here we shifted into the same garden. Your couple is good, man. What are your names? Sir, my name is Bhadraiah and my lady's name is Bhadramma. -What, the same name? -Yes! We are on same word and in same garden and thus. Fine, do we get any fruits in this garden? You get palm fruits, sir. But this isn't the season. You get palm toddy instead of fruits, sir. Toddy! We like palm toddy very much. Let's first have that and then see the site. You wait, man. Wait! Brother in law, I heard palm toddy from his mouth and my tongue is longing. -Come on, brother in law. -Come, sir! You can have it after going there. Toddy is my guy's weakness. -Come on, brother in law. -Come, sir! -Sir, I'll take leave. -Fine, leave! -Are there five to six palm trees in here? -There are more, sir. -Brother in law, there is the toddy. -Wait idiot, wait! To hell with your toddy madness! Why are you so greedy? -Are you fine, sir? -All that is next! You first pour the toddy. -Ok, sir! -Come on! You need palm toddy, cashew toddy or mango toddy? See if there is the poisonous toddy and drink that. Whatever it is, you pour the toddy. -No way sir, you got to say which. -Fine, pour palm toddy. -I have only palm toddy sir. -Why not say that first. Come on, pour! -I wanted to know what you like, sir. -You knew, right? Pour! -Come on, pour! -I'm pouring. -What again? Now you need white, black, blue, yellow or red? Which one? -Pour white! -Oh, white! -I have only white, sir. -Why not say that first. Come on, pour! -What's this fellow? -Pour it, man. I wanted to know what you like. To hell with your knowing! Pour it now, idiot. One drop or two drops? Half glass or a full glass? Or you want the whole pot? -Whole pot! Give it here. -Oh no! Slow down! Hey, your stomach will burst and you'd die. Oh no! -Give owner's number. -Yes sir! -Visiting card, sir. -Ok! Sir, I'll take it out. You please sit. Good! -Careful, sir! See you, sir. -Fine! -Sir! -What? -We came as Sir gave us time. -Do you have the card? -We never come without that. -Appointment! Sandeep, give it to Sir. -Brother in law, see the board. -What? Sir, please come. -Let's go, brother in law. -Let's go! Cash, hah! -Oh no, wow! -Brother in law, he is there. -Wow, he's luxurious. -Yes! He has great level, a man suitable to his name. Whatever, it is tough to hide the charm of money in a person, Simham. -It automatically comes up, brother in law. -Yes! -Ok, move. -Let's go! -Namaste sir! -Yeah, please sit. -Namaste sir! -Yeah! -Please say. -We came seeing your site, sir. -Which site? -Sir would have many sites. Say which one. The site near Botanical garden, sir. -I don't like bargaining. -We came knowing about that, sir. -That is 5 acres and 2 yards. -We saw that and came, sir. -I wish to close an acre at 15. -We came liking that, sir. Didn't you get a doubt why I'm giving at such low price? We don't have any question, sir. We have the answer. -Huh, what's that? -Profit management! -Don't you wish to know what that is? -If you can say... -A friend of mine is constructing apartments in Dubai. -Sir! -He offered cost to cost. -Sir! -I'd get more than double in18 months. -Sir! A clever guy would adjust with what he gets today. A highly clever guy would focus at what he'd be getting tomorrow. Wow, you said it great sir. This is called as long vision. -Far sight! -Oh! -We call this as profit management also in our circle. -Wow! You said it great, sir. You carried us along, sir. -Our guy is acting great, right? -Performance is next level. -I do have my selfish reasons too in this. -What are they, sir? You must complete registration in 30 days. We will finish it in 15 days sir, if you permit us. -I need 5 Crores as advance. -Brother in law, three! Sir, I'll pay three crores cash and get two crores cash after two days. -Are you sure? -Sure, sir! -I'm from a dynasty tearing apart our hearts for good will, sir. -Yes! Sir, man sitting before you isn't ordinary person, Gajula Gangarao. There's never chance to break the word or go back. Then, come and take the site documents on that day. Ok sir! -Secretary! -Sir! -There are people in line for that Gachibowli site, right? -Yes sir! Ask them all to come and meet in the evening after two days. Oh no, no need sir. I won't let them come. No need, right? Then give the money and take receipt. Come on sir, a receipt from you? Will anyone with brains do that? If needed, let's see after paying the balance two. First keep this three in, sir. We shall bring the balance two by day after morning. -Oh God! -Hey! -See you, sir. -We'll take leave sir. -Ok! -[Old popular song playing] -Fool thinks it is ringtone. -Whatever, it is great App. -Sweet you fed is too sweet. That is made of jaggery, brother in law. Hello! Hey, he thinks I'm really on a call. -Yes! -Yes! -Where did you get so much money? -Gajula Gangarao gave, uncle. So he realised his mistake and repented. No uncle. When should a man doing business as his business repent? We did the same to him as what he did to you. He just knows to cheat and he cheated you. We know to cheat him and he got cheated. Lord Krishna says victory is always on the side of righteousness. Righteousness is on your side. Victory took a turn and came to us. You don't keep anything else now in your heart, uncle. Hey, come here. You let your dreams come true. Construct a good house. Lay a good path for Ramu's future. Oh no uncle, why are you getting up? [Crying] -Son! -Please calm down, uncle. -How can I repay your debt? -We're here for you, uncle. Calm down. Uncle, please sit. We'll take leave, uncle. Take care of your health. -See you aunty! -Ok, dear. -Come on, guys! Let's go! -See you aunty, bye! -Hey, thank you! -Why to me? Though new, you did great. You excelled in the character. -Thus, it worked out great. -No! You thought in a new way and thus it worked out well.

Why is the line of money seen so think in my palm straight like drawn with a scale? Brother in law, they say there is a connection between lines in palm and good times. You just gave three crores advance and got twenty five crores profit. You aren't an ordinary man, brother in law. [Laughs] -That's true. -Brother in law, there's another matter. -What is that? -Yes, what was that? Profit Management! Looks like you understood that better than that Dhanraj. [Laughs] Brother in law, you also know palmistry? We say future seeing such a big site and is this small palm any big matter? Brother in law, there is a smaller thing than this palm in my head. Can you predict the future of that? Enough to see with my eye and I can see everything. -What's that item in your head? -My tongue! Should I see tongue for that? Will you predict without seeing? Come on, tell brother in law. Your idiotic mind is longing for toddy. You said it great, brother in law. Come on, let's go once to the site and I can fulfil my tongue's need. Not now, we shall go after paying the balance two crores. Brother in law, that site has become yours once you stepped in there and that tree has become mine once I drank toddy from it. -Let's go once without talking anything. -No man, listen! Brother in law, promise on your fate. Don't say a word. -You say so? -Yes! Fine then! -Yes! -Get down fast, brother in law. Oh no! -Hey, where did the gate vanish? -It is missing, brother in law. There should be a security guard here, right? He isn't there. -Oh no! Hey! -Brother in law! -There was a shed of sheets here, right? -Yes! Even that is missing, brother in law. Have we come to the correct place or not? We came to the correct place, brother in law. There is the 20 Km mile stone. Then what's this? I don't understand anything, brother in law. Brother in law, there is some advertisement board. Advertisement board, my foot! Is that required now? You'll know if needed or not, if you come here and see. Come, brother in law. -What, man? -See! -Oh no! This site belongs to government of Telangana. -Telangana! Trespassers will be punished. That means, unrelated people will be punished roaming here. -Is this a Government site? -Yes! Oh God! Even that palm tree belongs to Government, brother in law. We are cheated, man. What to do now? Hey, we should urgently go to that Chakravrthy's house. -Brother in law, this way. -Come on! Oh no! -Hey! -Brother in law! -Why is nobody here? -What? Brother in law, even that board we saw before isn't here. Oh no! No board here and even there. What is this, man? Hey, let's see if there is anyone in. Come on! Brother in law, not that one. Knock this door. -Excuse me! -Again! -Excuse me! -Excuse me! -No cars, no men, no umbrellas. -No! -It is all barren now. -Yes, brother in law! -Excuse me! -Excuse me! -Whom do you want? -Brother in law, somebody is here. This is the house of Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy, right? -No, this is a house given on rent for shootings. -What? There should be a board showing Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy outside, right? -Whoever shoots would keep the board they want. -What? Ok, were you here when we came the day before? How will we know when you had come here? Are you any producer or a director coming to see the location? Neither of the both, I'm into real estate business. Ok! Whom did you give on rent for shoot day before? One minute, sir! I'll check the register and tell. -Ok, go and check it. -See it fast. -Bring it, come on. -Come on, man! As per this register, producer name is Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy. -Ok fine, address! -Address is... 282/76/R/24A, near Botanical gardens, Gachibowli... -Brother in law, that's our site address. -Opposite 20 Km Mile stone, Hyderabad! What our site still, man? [Crying] -Banner name is 'Antha Bhranthiyena (Is everything an illusion) films'! -Oh no! -[Pathos song playing] -Stop that machine, brother in law. -Let it play song for our situation. -[Pathos song continues] Dhanraj Chakravarthy cheated us, let's go brother in law. [Crying] Careful. -Hey! -Sir! -We walk and you follow slowly. -Ok sir! -Hey, brother in law! -Brother in law! -You think we lost three? -It looks so, brother in law. Idiot, all dirty advises! You said profit management, right? I said so thinking you'd understand. I also asked if you understood, right? You said milk turning curd, curd to butter and butter to ghee, right? I said it. Who wouldn't be greedy to get five crores profit even before buying? -Did they come? -Yes, they were to come. Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy! Three crores, man! -Whose account do I write it? -In your nuisance account, brother in law. I'll write in your toddy account. You went running for toddy, right? Write! All our staff seeing my account will ask what happened. I'll then explain everyone in detail. In detail! No brother in law, if everyone knows about this, it'll be a remark on our goodwill thinking we can't properly buy and what can we sell. Past is past! I won't tell and you too don't tell about that. -Let's bury it within ourselves. -This deal is ok for me. Look, if you ever feel I'm slipping my tongue anywhere, use the code by saying 'silence' and I'll cover up. When you slip your tongue, I'll use the same code and you cover up. -This idea is great, brother in law. -Got clarity after all this. Yes brother in law, we found the comb after losing the hair. -What? -No, it was just for a rhyming. It is like buying site on the moon if that is a Government land. We can neither go there or allowed to bring in here. -Yes brother in law! -[Song about moon playing] Let's go! [Humming the song] [Sighs] Shakunthala! Hasini! -Come on, come! -What, husband? Take her and get her ready fast. It is not any ordinary match coming now. A family from Amalapuram! A traditional family! They are not any low compared to us, but are higher. He is the landlord of 100 acres like me. In addition, he has four rice mills, two textile shops, one departmental stores and a single son. What are you seeing? You have nothing to see, except for them to come and see you. It is the match invited after I directly went to Amalapuram saw, spoke, liked and said ok to them. The boy is a bright guy. He is born and brought up in Amalapuram. There is no chance for this to fail. I set this up so carefully. Go and get her ready. Thank God, we finally reached. Namaste! -Oh no, father in law! I should first wish him. -Namaste! -Namaste father in law, bless me first. -Oh no! Amalapuram! "Amalapuram!" -Husband! -Yes! -Bless me father in law, keep blessing me. -Oh no! -Enough now! -Mother in law, bless me. Did you bless? Fine, come on. What are you watching? -Move! -Please come! Wow, the house is superb. -You go and get her. -Ok! -She is coming. -Ok! Oh no, babe is superb! -Please have it. -No please! -No problem, have it. -No please! -Have it, dear. -No please! -Will you have coffee otherwise? -Oh, no please! -They say matches don't succeed if eaten. -"Amalapuram!" -Amalapuram! -Yes! You can ask, if you wish to ask her anything. -I'll ask. -Oh! What, son? How much is four multiplied by five? A bit easier! -How much is three into five, dear? -A bit more easier. -Ok, two into five! -Very much easier! Easier than this? How much is one into five, dear? Why do you ask such difficult things, dad? -What, difficult son? -"Amalapuram!" Yes dear, father cultivates organic vegetables, right? -You know that, right? -What? Say four vegetable names you know. Bottle guard, eggplant, ladyfinger and tomato! -I asked the girl. -I said the answer. Ok, does she sing any songs? No daddy, I said not to trouble in front of people right? "Amalapuram!" His domination is gone high. I think better if we talk about formalities in front of the children. -Sure! In our Amalapuram... -You wait, daddy! Did you stop again? Uncle, you'd give whatever you wish to your daughter. -Oh no! No problem, even if you don't give. -What? "Amalapuram!" So, you liked the girl right? Yes uncle, liked a lot. -What's this pinching, son? -Oh, you! Then, shall we go ahead with exchanging the plates? -Will he let me talk at least now? -You can talk about this now. My son trusts Amalapuram priest a lot. He said to fix a good time to exchange the plates, if we like the girl. I'll let you know about that. We can then arrange for the engagement. Then fine, ok for both the parties. All good! -We'll now take leave. -Ok! -Are we leaving? -See you! -We'll take leave. -Fine! -Why is the babe not seeing? -Son in law, you can see after marriage. -See you brother in law. -Ok, brother in law. -See you, brother. -Fine, dear. Marriage is fixed now, yes! -Father in law, bless me. -Oh no, it is too much now. -Let the marriage take place soon, I love you father in law. -Ok! -Leave now, dear. -Is he saying to leave? Fine, I'll come back again right? Come on dude, let's come back again. Bye! [Sighs] Mom, do something. I can't imagine myself without Vijay. Dad has finalised everything there. Mom, stop this somehow. I don't need the life without Vijay. Vijay and me! I need only that way. Other... Mom! -I came to say even my opinion after it reached here. -No, don't say! You said everything you had to say till now. Enough now, stop it. You forgot mother's responsibility carrying her love responsibility. You can't see the path even with great light, where there is no love, husband. -Saying all such things... -By saying... -What mistake have I done? -Have I said, you did a mistake? Have I ever said no to what you said? No! Then, why am I saying it now? This is a problem related to her life. Love is a matter related to her heart, husband. [Coughing] Are you encountering my talks? No husband, I'm answering to what is asked. Stop the discussion with this. Better if stopped before I lose my patience. I never raised my hand on you, in our 25 years of companionship. Don't let that situation arise now. Daddy, I shall talk to you if permission is granted. You gave everything without asking and please give me even this, daddy. I'll keep you in my heart forever saying my father accepted my love. If you do anything else denying that, I'll have to live as a slave in weeping thinking just about you. [Crying] I'm having to say this, though it is tough to say. Don't give me a punishment to pretend love at some other place for my whole life, daddy. It is not possible for me to imagine you as a permanent enemy in my heart, daddy. [Crying] Why are you like that, daddy? Mr. Venkata Ramana is coming into my thoughts continuously, son. It is natural to remember those hurting us, daddy. No son, I felt there's a lot to learn from him. His love on his daughter and his efforts towards that... I never had shown that for you, son. I always scolded you. Entire time was enough just to clear the troubles overshadowing us. I felt so many times, light shouldn't come while sleeping on the cot. -I had no answer for tomorrow's hunger. -Calm down, daddy. -Forgive me, son. -Don't say so, daddy. You never let me sleep in hunger even with so many problems. Will anyone get a father who loves more than you, daddy? My dad is greater than Mr. Venkata Ramana to me, My dad's love is greater. -Sir! -Sir, you! Please come. Please come, sir! Will you have water, sir? -You too please be seated. -No problem, sir! You came so far. We would have come, if you sent a message. We should come as per the tradition and this is correct. I spoke all rubbish when you came to my house that day. -Please do not mistake me. -Oh no, don't say that sir. Every word you spoke as a responsible father was true. Our respect on you grew witnessing the love over your daughter, but none of us thought otherwise, sir. Any father should think about the capability of the person, while giving her hand to another person. You have done that, sir. After I grow old will think the same as you, when I'm into such a situation. Thus, I decided to approach you only I after prove my capability. I thought richness lies only in money all these days. But I came to know it lies in the personality after seeing you. When I asked if you have so much wealth when you came to my house, you loyally said no. That is the richness. When I asked if your son has so much of capability, you silently returned with self-respect, but haven't said anything. That has the richness. Even after knowing my daughter likes you so much, you waited for my acceptance but didn't think to elope. That is called as richness. That is the manners. What is counted in rupees is the wealth and which can't be counted are the manners. When I came now and asked to marry my daughter, you said your decision to approach after proving yourself. That is the confidence you have on yourself. If I wait now till that confidence comes true, my family will look at me as a businessman. If I don't stop and go ahead, my love over my daughter will be proved. Give me the chance to prove myself to my daughter, brother in law. -Agree, son. -Ok, daddy. Seeing all this, I wish to prepare fish curry. -Sir, you too have food and go. -Okay! Please come, sir! -Namaste, Mr. Rao! -Oh no, Namaste sir. Please sit. -You too be seated. -Did I ever sit in front of you before you sit, sir? [Laughs] Please sit! It is my daughter's marriage and you should definitely come. Oh, came so far to give me the card sir? I'd have come if you just called me. Still, you helped our company a lot financially and are still doing it, sir. -You are paying me interest, right? -Is even that an interest? [Laughs] -Please come for sure. -Sure sir, I'm very happy. Director sir, why are you here so suddenly? -My marriage got fixed suddenly. -Wow! -I came to give the card. -Congrats! -Thank you! -He came with a good news. Not just coming, you should be receiving the guests at the reception. -What about marriage? -You should come sure for marriage too. Then, ok! Not just that, we shall do anything you say. -Yes! -Sorry! Please don't mistake me as I'm giving it here. It is not important where you give, but affection is important. -Yes! -We'll definitely come. -Thank you! You should come for sure. -We'll definitely come. -I'll take leave now. -Leave it on us now. -See you! -Ok bye! [Sounding the drum beats] -Sir! Sir! -How is the film? Mind blowing, sir! Wow, what a fight sir? This is like the first film for our director Mr. Vijay. What shall I say if they ask for the story? Bro, film is super. Full of entertainment! We eat Gobi (Cauliflower) in manchuria and here comes Dundubhi! Director's name is Vijay and we should hail for him. Human has two eyes and two kidneys, meaning two Billion club. Hail to Vijay! -Picture is a blockbuster. -Super! -Move, idiot. Sir! Where is your Director sir? He's seen nowhere. He got married this morning. I came here after attending that. This evening is his reception. All press come down there and we shall talk in leisure. -Ok sir! -Can we too come there? Come over, you also have food there. [Chants] Please come, sir! Please come! [Chants] Flourish with happiness and pleasure! And you! [Chants continued] -Namaste, dear! -Sir! -Happy married life. -Thank you, sir! Our film is a very big hit. You know, all distributors are calling and screaming to get great returns. How much ever I thank you will not be enough. Oh no! Why thanks in between us, sir. -Correct, we are all a family. -Yes, sir. I saw the film sitting with audience this morning. I felt theatre may blast with those whistles, claps and screams. I'm so very happy, sir. -But... -But? -That is... -No problem, please say sir. -If you don't mistake me... -No problem, please say. What was the story in that? Sir, marriage and all this! I'll still say the story sir. Oh no! No problem, you can say that some other time. -Ok? -Ok sir! -You can say whenever you feel like saying. -[Cell phone rings] -It is the buyers. -Ok! Hello! Wish you happy married life and congratulations for the grand success of your film. -Thank you sir! -Thank you! -Namaste, sir! -Namaste! -Thank you, sir. -Have food and leave! -Namaste! -Namaste! Thank you! Congratulations sir, -Your film was super, Fantastic, sir. -Thank you! Theatre resounded with screams and shouts. Very good, sir! Please come! This way! Come on! Fix them! Fix cameras from this end to that end. Go on! Wait for one minute! Hello Swapna, am I visible in live? -Ok, all of you get ready for live. -Ok sir! -Hello Director sir, congratulations. -Thank you! -Hello madam, congratulations. -Thank you! Releasing today with the title 'Dundubhi and bagging a sensational hit... Broke all the records and creating new records by wiping out all old records... Dashing ahead is the film director Vijay and is in live with us now. Today is his marriage and also his film release. Both these are great successes. I can't stay back without appreciating the director bagging two victories like this. -Wish you happy married life! -Thank you! -Same to you, madam. -Thank you! -Sir, we heard yours is a love marriage. -Yes! Lover I dreamt of came as my wife. That is my luck. She also brought you a huge sensational hit along with her. -This is a bigger luck, right? -Yes, thank you! You gave such a sensational hit. How did you give those two flops in the past? That's because I didn't have her as my wife then. -He said it great, right? -He is your son in law, sir. So, those flops will not come at all from you right? -They won't! -Oh, how can you say? -Because she is my wife now. -I see! [Clapping] Sir, your son bagged such a huge success and what are your feelings? -Zoom! -I scolded him many times. Daddy! Please go on, why did you scold? We are on high, go on! -To give happiness. -How? -By giving a huge success. -He gave it, right? That's why I felt very happy. But you just felt bad with tears in eyes? Why? -Those are happy tears. -Well said, brother in law. -I'm your in law, sir. -Thank you! Sir, film released today. -But, you finalised the marriage before. -Yes! He already had two flop films. Did you agree by knowing that? Yes! You know that I'm Venkata Ramana cultivating organic crops, right? I know, sir. Don't I know which seed to be used for better crop? You know, sir. -Why did you ask after knowing it? -Well asked, brother in law! I'm your in law, right? [Laughs] Swapna, bonding of these in laws is heart touching. This will be a good feeling and a good example for our audience in live. -Hey, this is live right? -Yes, sir! You please say how did our director get two flops in the past and our audience will feel very happy. -Yes, I will say right away. -Yes, please say. I'm producer of Dundubhi. My name is Munikonda and surname is Anakonda. I'd say to be always indebted to our director Vijay for giving me such a huge success. Sir, I didn't ask that. -Yes, I'll say that now. -Yes, I want this one. Say! You'd be surprised listening to what I say. I just signed agreement to run this film in extra 2000 screens from tomorrow. How much ever I thank Vijay is less for this, right? [Clapping] Hey, what is this? Hey, look there Vijay. I'm seeing our people like this today as I heard your words that day. If not, I should have been seeing them differently. -Thank you so much! -Hey, why thanks between us? Move aside! We need answer for audience for the two flops given. -Fine, I'll say. -Say something, sir. Zoom! What can I give to repay when my director gave me such a huge success? For the film done... -I'm gifting him this car! -Car! -You need zoom now? I'm worrying as I didn't get answer. I'm also giving him one crore rupees advance cheque. Sister, give this to brother in law from your hands. -Thanks, sir! -Sir, why all this now? Don't say so brother in law, good time that my sister came into your life. This is the advance for next film. Please don't say no, brother in law. We are all a family, you shouldn't forget. Sir, put aside giving this car and cheque. You first say something, live is running. Don't we need a controversy? Shut up! Who remembers flops other than hits? You controversy fellow! Hey man, move aside. What is that drum sound, Simham? Not drum sound brother in law, it is sound of success. May be the fans! -So fast? -Public aren't delaying now like before, brother in law! -It is all fast now. Social media effect! -What is all this social media? -Namaste, sir! -Namaste! Oh no! -Hey Simham! -Brother in law! -We saw him somewhere, right? -I too feel the same, brother in law. He is Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy, right? He looks similar, but is not him. They say seven persons exist in the world who look similar. No! I'm getting some doubt, man. -Shall I ask? -Ask, brother in law. [Clears throat] Excuse me, I feel to have seen you somewhere. You might have seen. -Where is that? -Can be anywhere! What is that? -Dr Dhanraj Chakravarthy! -Sir, I'm flat for your affection. I understand your love on cinema for remembering a person playing -small roles by his character name, sir. -Character? What? I did 700 films till date, I. myself don't remember my character names and combinations I did and those films. -Oh no! -But, you remembered those. I bow my head and salute to your feet, sir. -Great artistes! -He did 700 films. He stole your heart. -Three crores! -Silence! Move in! -Let's go! -Give that here, sir. -Ramu! -Sir! -Sir is coming, take care. -Ok! -Please come, Greetings sir. -Oh no! Huh? -Simham! -Brother in law! Look at them. -I saw! -Don't they look like those two? -Who are those two, brother in law? -This is broker and he is surveyor. Sir, another party is coming to site for seeing one of our sites. I'll go there. Can you please take care here? -They look the same, brother in law. -Yes! -I'll ask. -Ask, brother in law. -Hey, man! -Sir! I remember to have seen you both somewhere. I acted in 200 films and also worked as assistant director for his films. He acted in 350 films. How will we know where you've seen us, sir? -Are you too from films? -Yes! -Hold this! -Ok! Have you seen me anywhere? Will images on screen see audience sitting in the theatre, sir? -You bloody... -Silence! -No more questions, only silence! -Yeah! -Sir, your flower! -Keep it. Look Mohan, take Sir on to the stage. -Namaste, sir! -Namaste! Oh no! Hey, did you recognise this fellow? No! He's the guy pouring you toddy. I remember drinking toddy, but why will I remember the guy pouring it, brother in law? -Three crores! -Silence! -We're coming. -Please come! -Let's go. -Let's go. Please go! -Careful! -Namaste Mr. Rao, please come. -My daughter and my son in law! -Hi sir! Sir, my name is Bhadraiah and my lady Bhadramma. -You both are those two, right? -Those two! -Bhadramma and Bhadraiah! -What? I understood now. Fine, why did you both target me? -Do you remember Adikapu? -Adi... I understood it completely. -Hey, this is tit for tat. -Yes, brother in law! -We cheated Adikapu and they cheated us. Account settled. -Yes brother in law. -Bless them. -Yes! Wild pig entered the garden, move. My dear well-wishers, I took this mike to say what I have on my mind to you all. I don't know whether to call them thanksgiving, emotions or deep feelings. My dad used to scold me daily for giving two flop films. That was just a show-off. He wanted to say something more and wanted something more from me and one day said it clearly. He said producer believing in you should be good and should not feel bad because of you. He said it wasn't good either for him or for us. That is true. Amongst so many scolding, just that truth questioned me that day. It made me stand before you like this with a sensational success. Daddy, you should always scold me like this. I know well how much betterment lies in that. -That truth is my future, daddy. -My cute son! Producer sir, thanks for such a big success. You've been asking what is the story from the beginning and I went on postponing. I know there'll be good story in the films I made and you came to me wishing for such a story. Films are of two types, sir. One, the story based films. They showcase only the story. Two, commercial films! Commercial elements showcase along with the story. The first one is an art. Second one is the cash, this is the truth my father said. Thus, you gifted me a car for the film I made. You also gave one crore advance for the next film. You wouldn't stay with me if I said the story in advance. We wouldn't be like this if I did the story you like. Thus, I had to use my screenplay even on you. Forgive me, producer sir. Thank you sir, for understanding me. And my father in law! He is so respectful and kind hearted. Your love on daughter and trust on son in law enhanced my responsibility. When you put your daughter in my hand... [Chants] Will you make sure the smile never vanishes from my daughter's face? You asked me that. Who can get a better loving father than him? That is my wife's luck. Father in law, I'll always stand on my word given to you. -Yes! -Yes! I promise on me and my wife and am giving word in front of all to take care of your daughter just like you did. [Clapping]
