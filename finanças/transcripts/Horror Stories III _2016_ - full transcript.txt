2416, the Earth forces wiped out the Fox that had escaped from Earth and have settled down in Mars. The only surviving girl seized a spaceship of the Earth forces, seeking asylum in Titan where the Robot live. Destination: Elevator Station, Titan's orbit Horror Stories III A girl from Mars Human! Kill it! No, I'm not a human. I'm a Martian citizen! I'm officially applying for asylum in this sanctuary! Who are you? I said I'm from Mars. Wherever you're from, a human shall no longer live. I'm not a human. The Earth forces came and killed my own species! My parents died. My friends and teachers are all dead. The only survivor is me. Your reaction is just like human's. I said I'm not a human! So, who are you? Wait! May I? A scholar named LEE Saeng dropped by my town that day. Fox Valley A lot of pain? We're almost there. Thank you for saving my life. I'll never forget it. This country have thieves everywhere to thank for corrupt officials, misdirecting this country. I'll hold government positions and take up the slack. You passed the state examination. Don't fail to keep your promise. There's something in the air. You're in no position to be picky. Your leg is in bad shape too. Anybody home? From the back, it looks like a woman. Excuse me. We bumped into the brigand. He hurt his leg and we got lost. Can we stay at your place for a night? You must be hungry. Please eat first. Today is the anniversary of my son's death. That must be hard for my daughter-in-law. It's once a year. Help yourself. The meat's entrails are pretty good for a man. Something smells fishy. I have a gut feeling they're hiding something. It's not natural. Do you think they're foxes in disguise? But she's beautiful. I would gladly be eaten even though she's a fox. We should leave early in the morning. Hit the sack early. Sleep tight. I'll stand guard. Nighty night. Sir. Sir. Sir! Please get up. It's time to go to work. One-eyed man left early to earn to pay for the meal. So, it's the right thing for you to earn to pay for the room. Where are we heading? To the mountain. Sir, this mountain is breathing. Breathing? This town is dying by inches of pestilence and starvation. We thought this mountain is dead. But, we realized one day it's breathing again. We must rescue this mountain. Or my town will be dead. We have a visitor after a long time. Does it get better than this good omen? How long did you dig this tunnel? We're in the 500th year. What the heck is that back there? Now, we're almost there. Where did he go again? He earned enough to pay for food. Where did he go? Oh, my god. You can't last much longer with the injured leg. It'll become dark soon. You can stay one more night. I'll make no charge. Sir. Sir, are you sleeping? Sir. May I have a word with you? This nutty tasting is perfect for night snack. If you left it as it is, you'd have had your leg cut off. Are you thankful to me? Sir. In any case, I'll be dead soon. Considering my daughter-in-law will be all alone, I'll never rest in peace. If you can hear the babies crying in this dying village, this whole town including her will be very happy for it. So please bless her with a child. Sir. Where are you going? My tummy is... I mean in my tummy... In your tummy? Poo. I have to take a dump. Sir! You survived. I thought you're dead! What happened? The old man asked me an absurd favor that night. I raised my voice. And he showed himself in true colors. It's a good thing that I came prepared. I said something smelled fishy. I heard there's a place called 'Fox Valley'. They must not be insignificant creatures like fox. They can quite freely change their faces and looks. I bet they must be something more than human. If they know what you should do as human, if they're gods with good brains to use it properly, they should rule this country, shouldn't they? Sir? Get off me! What did you do to the one-eyed man? I just borrowed his body. Young body is better. He is incredibly strong. What are you going to do to me? You wily beast! Man is the lord of all creation. You should put the duty before anything else. You're a merely wily beast! Why are you treating human's life like dirt? The lord of all creation? The lord of all creation? You're only a human. No, sir. A human is, for instance, a parasite. We've been here since human didn't exist. We'll be still here after every human is gone. We finally extracted the seed we need from human to do so. Now we're ready to wake it up in the mountain. So you should look at the finish on this too. What the heck is it at the end of this tunnel? I know nothing, except it holds the lifeblood of us. This crab picture is like a family spirit from age to age. A crab into the reeds represents your fidelity, which is firm in your belief. By all accounts, it firmly walked sideways under the eyes of the Dragon King of the sea. Sir. Sir? I thought you just walked away. But you made your adieu. Yes, we made it. With your seed, it finally woke up. We're ready to plow it down and make a new world. Will you join us? Or will you meet your death like a parasite here? Hey, let's get in. I said we should get in. Choose between two things. What is your answer? You wily beast! I'll never give in to insignificant creature like you! As a scholar with firm belief, once I hold government positions... It must be invented. I'm not a liar. We've held out for 800 years since that time. Unfortunately, there's no data on the species. I know. We left the Earth before you were created. You know what? We are not the last species that ever lived in the Earth. After all, we went to the Mars together. Why did you leave the Earth? People on Earth... We made considerable efforts to reform them. But, we failed. Human is foolish, destructive, and cruel to each other. And... And? What is it? Without a break... A runaway engine. Correct. Runaway. That reminds me of another story. Road Rage Yes, sir. I'm on my way out with my parents. Please wait for a moment. Yes, sir. The trading growth rate from the 3rd analysis data is correct. You're suffering great hardship at this time of night. Yes, have a good day! He never gives me a break. Don't throw a tantrum. I never threw a tantrum. Never? You're now throwing a tantrum. Let's go in quiet please. I've got so much to do. What is the truck doing in the first lane'? Are you doing this reluctantly? Tell me. You're tired and you got so much to do. But you're doing this reluctantly? We chose to leave on a trip, but you're throwing a tantrum. What am I supposed to do? That's why I suggested putting it off. I'm very busy this time of year. You're driving me crazy. Don't give me that baloney! We planned this earlier this year. Was it my idea? It was yours! Hey, stop it! I said it was hard for me! I worked all day including data analysis and was pestered by Manager Park, that son of bitch. It's really driving me nuts. Please! Please stop it and let's go. In quiet! What a complete nutcase! ls the truck driver insane? What are you doing? Stay calm. That bastard started this first. Is that lunatic playing a game with me? Just stay calm. The license plate is hidden. He's a real crook. Take a picture of it! Hey, let's just go. Don't pour oil on the fire. Just stay still. That's illegal. Take a picture of it now! - We should report it. - It's getting crazy. Hey, watch out! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Why did that lunatic suddenly break down on a highway? He's really bugging me! Su-jin, take a picture of it. Drive properly! That bastards should be all locked up. What are you looking at? That truck driver, why did he do that? He's just a complete nut. Never mind. Isn't it scary? That happens every day on the road. Don't worry. Yes, sir. What? What was missing? No, no way. I already checked it... Okay, I got it. Let me check it again and call you back. No, it's okay. Yes, have a good day! It's really killing me. Why does he want me to check it now? I want to kill him. You should drive. I'm a novice driver. I never drove down a highway. This is a matter of the future of us at stake, Su-jin. I should get over Manager Park to be promoted and get hitched with you. It's scary to drive down a highway at night. I love you. I'm pulling it over. Look in front of you. Check the speed. Wow, you're a good driver. Don't speed up too much. Don't get cold feet, no matter what they say. I'm counting on you and working. What is missing, bastard? Dong-gem, wake up. Wake up! Why? Look back! You must be driving too slow. What is he doing now? Wait. Is this that bastard before? The license plate is just the same! He's going for broke on this. Change lanes! Change them now! That bastard. Why are you keep provoking him? That bastard provoked me first. Beat it, you idiot! Turn it now! What is he doing? Speed up a little! I said speed up! He's a dead man tonight. What you are doing? I have to give him hell, or he'll back out. Dong-geun! Stay here. Hey, get out of it! Get out of it, you bastard! Damn it. Why isn't he answering my calls? Dong-geun! Hey, what's wrong? What's happening? Dong-geun! Are you okay? Dong-geun, get up! Dong-geun, stay with me! Dong-geun! Is there anybody? Is there anybody? Help me! Dong-geun, get up! Drop us off! Please drop us off! I'm so sorry! Drop us off! Here! We are here! We are here! ls there anybody? I said we're here! Please help us! We are here! Here! We are here! Why are you doing this to us? What did we do wrong? You idiot! Dong-geun, get up. Get up! Oh my god! Don't leave me. Hold me! Dong-geun, let's go. You go first. I can't go alone. I'll deal with him. Go and report it to the police. Dong-geun, look back! Save me, please. Are you okay, Su-jin? Su-jin, what's wrong with you? How pathetic! Above all things, their presence itself is disgusting. Human is a cancer cell on Earth. But they created us. I'm scared a nut might chase me here. That's right. Even you're not a human, if I let you live, humans will chase you here someday. If we're defeated by humans, this planet will be polluted and devastated in a flash too. So what? Can I speak frankly? What? You're not the only one who suffered among humans. We robots are the same. Among brutal parasites, how we can evolve, develop our consciousness, and learn how to survive against them. I'll let you know. Robot Spirit I've got you! Dunko got caught. You're it now! Dunko is it. Phone is ringing. Will you answer it? - Phone is ringing. - Turn on the screen. GANG Jin-go, did you eat? What about homework? Let me play more. I'll do it later. Will you ignore what I say because I'm not home? Why aren't you coming? Mommy is always not home. Mommy is working now. Let me speak to Dunko. Dunko, help Jin-go with his homework. And vitamin is... His math homework is the 2nd unit on page 57. 2 vitamin tablets a day, don't chew, but melt them. Lunch is sandwich on the 2nd shelf in the fridge. It's in the same place for 10 years. Thanks, Dunko. Dunko is Jin-gu's friend forever. Dunko, what did she say? Let's eat and do your Korean homework. The magnetic forces levels is 85mT now. The air quality is 120. Jin-go! Mommy's project went through! What do you want to eat, son? Mom, my tummy hurts. Lunch is sandwich. Dunko's memory chip. How did he confuse oil with dressing? Its recommended consumption time was over 5 years ago. The memory failure is inevitable. Is it like dementia? Can he be repaired again? It's beyond repair. You should discard it. He's been a family member for 10 years. How can I discard him? It's only for user safety. Will Jin-go let him go? It is recommended to buy a safe, inexpensive and new robot. Let's paint a picture. Yes, but later. I'm sleepy now. Let's paint a picture. Mom! Mom! Play with me. Be patient. Mommy will take you to the repair center. I mean to the hospital. You'll be surely recovered and come back home. Did it hurt a lot? - Sorry. - No, we're friends. Dunko is Jin-gu's friend forever. Jin-go is also Dunko's friend forever. Let's stay together forever. Promise me. See you at my birthday, Dunko. Fix me, Mom. Okay. Sorry, Dunko. It's for Jin-go. Memories of us Memories of us End the memories of us. The magnetic forces levels is 150mT now. Please put on protection suits when you go out. Dunko is really dead? Jin-go. Dunko was really sick. Let's think he's rather lucky, not yet awakened. And Dunko is not dead. He lives in our memories forever. I'm working on the project. I'll spend more time with you now. What's that? How do you do? I am PZ3000. User safety is my first priority. Carbon coated with natural substance tissue, so there's no danger of oil leaking. Unlike the existing model, my memory filter is protected by triple firewall. So I am much safer for you. The day after tomorrow is your birthday. It's your birthday gift. Thank you, mommy. It's a happy family. It looks great. Why don't you paint this part a little more? Who is Dunko? Nothing. Dunko Dunko Don't! Don't, Dunko! No, Dunko! No, don't! What are you doing? We were just playing. This clothes... - Did you dress him? - No, he dressed himself. - What? - This is Dunko. Say it, Dunko. Ask me to play with you like before! Jin-go. My heart also aches for Dunko. But, if Jin-go keeps him in your mind like this, I'm getting more upset. Let's let him go now. Then you'll grow up. And don't ever paint this kind of picture. Promise me. I didn't paint it. Then who painted? He did it too. Dunko, answer me! GANG Jin-go, stop doing this! Dunko is not here any more! No, he's Dunko! Dunko, answer me! Dunko! Hand it over! Now! You're grounded in your room until tomorrow! There'll be no birthday party for you! PZ3000's memory chip. Turn on the screen. Check the system failure. The system is being checked. There is a bug on the memory. What bug? Ghost folder found. Download? The signal must be mixed due to the electromagnetic field. Delete the ghost folder. It must be deleted on the place of dispatch. Then find it! The place of dispatch is very close to you. Close to me? Where? Enough. Stop finding. Turn off the screen. Mom, my tummy hurts.

Please stay at home and shut off the power supply of every household electronics. Ready to delete. Remove the memory chip. Mom? Is it Dunko? Why did you dump me? I never dumped you. - Because you died... - Open it. You promised. Sorry, Dunko. We can't stay together now. Please come out! Jin-go! Jin-go! Where are you, Jin-go? Play with me. Mom, I came back home. It's okay. It's okay now. From the temporary folder, the data is being retransmitted to the final destination. From the temporary folder, the data is being retransmitted to the final destination. From the temporary folder, the data is being retransmitted to the final destination. From the temporary folder, the data is being retransmitted to the final destination. Stop it, Dunko! I was wrong. I thought you hurt Jin-go. I thought it was my fault. That's why I dumped you. I'm so sorry. I'm begging your forgiveness. So please let us go now. The service engineers arrived. Will you forgive me? We're family. You can't separate us. We'll stay together forever. Right, Jin-go? No! I'll keep my promise. I'll be your friend forever. We can coexist peacefully. If I'm dead, I won't just stand by and do nothing. I've watched the war between two species for ages. From a distance. I finally judged humans' expiry date is over. If we put up with it again, I felt every conscious creature will be gone in our solar system. That makes two of us, right? I carefully picked a wandering asteroid and modified its orbit. There were quite a lot of humans who stupidly longed for the gift and prayed for it. Good-bye, Earth. Kid. Welcome. Now you survived.
