On this land, the Hitlerites began to carry out their secret plan "Ost", practicing methods of extermination and enslavement not only of Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians, but also of Poles, Czechs, Serbs. Our people responded with courageous resistance. Many thousands of partisans fought in Belarus. In every handful of earth, in each person, the memory of the war lives on. Every fourth person perished here. Madam, have you ever heard the word Khatyn? - No. - And the word Lidice? - Not that either. - And Oradour, in France? - Yes, of course. - That's all, thank you. Could you say if you've heard of Khatyn in Belarus? - No. - You haven't heard. - And Oradour, in France? - Yes. - And you haven't heard about it? - Lydiss, is it? No, it is Oradour in France and Lidice in Czechoslovakia. And about Khatyn. The village Khatyn here in Belarus. No, no. I don't know. - And you? - I don't know. Will you tell us what it is? Morning Larionov ROMA! To the Nazism victims' monument Khatyn, 5km - Friends! - Dear friends! Dear comrades! Former partisans, men and women! Allow us, former Chkalov Brigade partisans to give you our partisan battle greetings! From dust, the land of Belarus, all demolished cities have risen, collective farm fields bloomed! But we will not forget the wartime days! Every village today is surrounded by the forested ashes of burned villages, to which no one returned after the war. There was nobody to return! All burned by the Nazis! It was a pre-planned murder. Hitler signed a death sentence for entire nations. On our soil, the Nazis practiced their barbaric methods of exterminating Poles, Czechs, Englishmen, Belgians, and others. People all over the world know what they were saved from by our Soviet army, which defeated the Nazis! But we did not surrender to the enemy! We avenged them for the blood and suffering of our people ...to the heroes who fell for freedom and the independence of our homeland. Khatyn, 5km I may have something to do with Khatyn, so to speak. In general to this kind of thing. Just the other day I received a letter from a place, from one area, where they asked me, you know, to clarify names, you know, years of birth of my loved ones, my relatives, who were also exterminated, and shot. Among them, so to speak, my 9-year-old son. A clear, empty field with a bell on it. And there's no flashy stuff. And all of the villages' names are engraved on it. I will never forget, only those who have not been hurt have forgotten. Those have forgotten, but those who have suffered will forever remember, think about it. The wounded, those who are now disabled, how can they forget the war? Everybody remembers. So they burned the village the first time, then the peasants built smaller houses. They burned down those houses. Then they built dugouts. They came and destroyed the dugouts in the next blockade, in '43. I remember an old man being questioned: "Well, why are you building this dugout here on this place?" He says: "No, son, if I build it there, you will say: 'Ah, we won, the village is gone!' So we still built it the fourth time and we live here, we didn't surrender to the German." This is their psychology. On March 22, 1943, a special punitive unit of Hitlerites broke into the village of Khatyn. The village was completely destroyed. Children, women, and the elderly were herded into a barn, which was doused with gasoline and set on fire. Those who tried to escape the fire were shot with a machine gun. The number of victims: 76 children, and 74 adults. One man survived: Yuzif Kaminsky. I ask, "Why are you naked?" Well, he says, they ripped our clothes off, undressed us. So, they pushed us in and closed, pushed us in and closed. They pushed us in so much, you couldn't raise your arms. So, there were hay and straw, this is where we feed the livestock. They set the door on fire, the barn, the roof is made of straw, and they set the door on fire. The roof is burning, fire is falling on our heads, the hay and straw are now also on fire, people are suffocating. I say to my son, I am stuck at the wall, at the wall with all my arms and legs, and I see that the doors are opened, doors are opened, people are getting out, what's happening? And they say that if you go to the door, you are shot. But they decided, it was better to get shot. Everybody started to clutch their kids, the voices were terrifying. And the fire is falling on the heads. I say to my son, he is 15 years old already: "You need to get over others' heads!" I started pushing him on top of others. And he got out, only hair on his head burned a little. He ran for like 5 meters, and then they shot him. They shot him. I am thinking, how do I save myself? So I go to the bottom, thinking this is how I do it. As soon as I get to the bottom, dead bodies started to pile on me. They piled up so hard, it was hard to breathe. Then it became a bit better with my breath, I also freed up my head. Breathing was easier, then I started to turn to one side, then to another. I was stronger back then, so I threw all the bodies off me. As soon as I crawl up to the doorstep... And here is my son: "Daddy, daddy, you are alive!" So I am like: "Stand up, let's go! Let's go already!" I started to lift him, but his guts popped out, and his groin rolled out. And he was only able to ask: "Father, are you all right?" God forbid anyone alive should see what I have seen. So many innocent people died. Names & ages 9 years 7 years Khatyn. Khatyn. Khatyn. 2,000 Khatyns. 2,000 Khatyns. 2,000 Khatyns. 2,000 Khatyns. You can destroy the car like that! Maybe, we should first go back? *Hospital for Disabled War Veterans* Deal it! *playing a game of dominoes* - We can do it once more. - Deal it! Well, it's your decision! - Three! - Put it on the table! I have two! And as bad as it is, shrapnel goes right into his left hand, Then he says: "Lie down, guys, or they will kill you!" But what I want to point out is that he had such a strong stomach, that he stayed like this for 2-3 minutes more, got into the tank, rode for three kilometers to his battalion, ordered the battalion to line up, then the paramedic came to bandage him. Then, our friend said, as you do: "Keep up the battalion's traditions." "I'm", he showed his hands like this, "not a fighter myself anymore." Got into the tank and drove himself to the hospital. In the first days of war you... *unintelligible* In the first days, I was studying. I was studying for a peaceful job. Afternoon Hemostat, please. And then my mother started to cry. I raised my head and saw that they got her here. And she is already dead, The oldest one didn't even hear it. She didn't moan, nothing. Killed her in front of me and that's it. I think, I myself will escape, should I leave my kids under the burning roof? So I took my small one and brought her to the pit. I brought the old one to that pit as well. I felt her, she was so soft... Stepan Novitskiy former village Perehodi If you abandon your children... Not everyone can do that. We have here women repenting, who also left their children. I don't think they did, who knows what would... It's not OK to die altogether as well, right? At least somebody should survive. So this is what my wife decided, she decided this way. She didn't leave our kid, she stayed there. They burned the church, shot everything with machine guns. I am in shock, because the little girl that was sitting there, little one, 4 years old, they shot her in the chest with explosive bullets, so her chest was torn up. All this blood poured on me, I was covered in blood. I want to explain to them that they crushed me. Couldn't open my eyes, couldn't explain to them. He put the gun right to my chest and fired, and I rolled away. He wanted to shoot me in the head with the second one, but missed it. Hit me in the ear instead. Danila Vorobyov former village Zbushin And they left. I wanted to smoke before I die. For the last time, I will have a smoke. And I found tobacco in my left pocket! But I can't feel my left arm, I can't turn it! So I managed to get tobacco with my right hand, rolled it, and lit it up. And just as I breathed in, I heard some noise! What is the noise, I turned my head, and I see — he is coming at me! So I realized, he wants to finish me off. And the horse is coming straight at me... And I also fell on those bodies, and I am the last one, and my kids, four of them, my oldest son, he was on that pile as well. And I hear how the German sat on my legs, and he shoots at the others with a machine gun. He uses explosive bullets, so everything is ripping, all bloody, smoke piles up, the air is so bad, you cannot take it anymore. And then I lost consciousness from my wounds. I only felt how they kicked me with their legs. Into the ground... And they pushed us in, and they pushed us in... And they shot, and I fell, and they pinned me down... My head was pinned down...

Khatyn Khatyn Khatyn Khatyn is the memory of former villages, 10,000 of them in Belarus. Over 2,000 villages were burned together with people in them. Over 2000 Oradours. Over 2,000 Lidices. Siniy Kamen Secret documents of the Nazi Reich: Major cities of Belarus: Minsk, Vitebsk, Gomel, Mogilev turned into ruins. The disappearance of the symbols of former Bolshevik supremacy, including buildings, corresponds to the tasks of the war of annihilation. There is no need to restore them. The city spoils the Belarusian. He is tied to the land. Planned for execution: There are no historical or artistic objects in the East that have any importance. The occupational forces should kidnap 40,000 to 50,000 Belarusian children aged 10 to 14. This action is taken to weaken the enemy's biological potential for a long time. Do not allow teaching mothers to care for infants or to prevent childhood diseases. Do not prepare children's doctors. Do not provide any support to kindergartens or other similar institutions. Writer Janka Bryl: I remembered my acquaintance Vladimir Keda, whose whole family was killed. And when after 15 years the remains were transferred to a burial place, he recognized his son by the large colored sword that he had bought him on the eve of the war. About the village Khatyn, here in Belarus. No, no. Diary of a former SS officer: Perhaps our defeat was primarily a victory. Only now, when we are defeated, have we become strong enough to break Russia. We will avenge ourselves with blood. We will turn all of Russia into a desert if we have the nuclear bomb.
