There's only a few more weeks till Christmas and there's still no snow. Sad. Oh, uh, Deena, that's Meg. Hold on just a second. Hey, Meg. I'm on my way in right now. Thank you for uploading the Harrison account. Any messages? Well, tell Livingston that he's gonna have to ask Milo. I didn't take those pictures. * A Happy New Year * Here we come a-caroling * Among the leaves so green * Here we come a-wandering * So fair to be seen * Love and joy come to you... Uh, excuse me. Sorry. * And God bless you and send you * * A Happy New Year * And God send you... Morning, Michelle. Good morning, Ms. Maddux. Oh! Ah... Oh, sorry, Ms. Maddux. What is this, a contest? - Yeah. - Right. Don't worry. I'm not decorating mine till after hours. Here are all the files you asked for. Your conference call's set for 3:00 p.m. - Great. - The Harrison account called. They love it. And I rescheduled your 9:00 a.m. for 4:00 p.m., because I know how much you hate Monday morning meetings. Oh, Meg. You know me inside and out. Thank you. I also happen to know you were here till 3:00 in the morning on a Sunday. Sacco's pizza delivery. 2:24 a.m. Final touches on the Harrison account. How many times is that this month? Just be glad I didn't make you come in. Yeah. Sorry. - What's up, Dee? - Uh, let's see. I need your expense report. Livingston's on a war path, and you have a massive run down your tights. - Uh... - Typical Monday. Oh, no! Can't go home to change now. Mmm, bam. - Thank you. - I know. I am such a lifesaver. Let's see, there was freshman week with Welcome William who wouldn't leave you alone. Senior spring break trip. No bikini. Even your first day here. We do not need to relive the headset incident, thank you. Wait till you hear what Marcos has planned for us tonight. A sunset walk on the highline, dinner at Chiano's, and then, I get to pick my first Christmas gift from a Bergdorf window! That sounds romantic. So, what about you? Any bites from that cupid express account I set up? Few potentials. No Mr. Perfect. Ooh, well, there's plenty of time before the holidays. Maybe I should change my filter so I'm open to more matches. I mean... I guess I could uncheck full head of hair, expand my search to the boroughs. Oh, no. No bridge and tunnel. Oh, great. Well, it looks like Marcos has an even better plan for us tonight. - No Chiano? - No Chiano. But Marcos and his friends are throwing a party at Oeuvre. - What's Oeuvre? - A new club. All the hot models are there, and you need to be there. Oh, Dee, you know I'm no good on a school night. Oh, come on, everyone knows that no one works the last two weeks before Christmas. Hi, Milo. We're in the middle of a conversation. Yeah. No, I'm sorry to interrupt. You're clearly very busy. Um, Livingston wants us in the conference room stat. There's a last-minute job. I thought you said no one works. I did, didn't I? FYI, he's, uh, he's really amped up this morning. - Great. - Oh, whatever. If it's an ad for fruit cake, you stick two hot people in a New Year's party scene. Gum? Two hot people in a New Year's party scene. - If it's pantyhose-- - We get it. No, seriously, pantyhose. Oh, shoot. - That would be your cue. - Oh, yeah, no... Okay, so, I'll see you in there. - Yeah. - All right, great. Are these SPANX? You know I always have your back. Sorry. Holly. Chelsea Diamonds has just canned Duxton Wells Agency, and they've chosen us to redo their campaign, Chelsea Diamonds, perfection. And they want it plastered all over Manhattan by, uh, Christmas Eve. - But... What? - Uh, that's pretty fast. All they really need from us right now is one iconic image. A teaser, really, for a much larger campaign that will continue and platform throughout the rest of the year. And we may not be the only agency competing for this campaign. I thought you two would be perfect to head this up, you know, since you don't have any obligations, family, uh, spouses. - I mean, I have a dog. - Thanks. Oh, and because, of course, you're my best, my very best. - Of course. - Of course. Okay, um, why don't we do a photo series showing love in all the traditional-- Some unexpected places. All right. For example, we can do a proposal, an anniversary, first kiss. You know, all the things that you expect out of love. We'll create that iconic image. I want lots of choices. Just keep the ideas coming. Now, Milo, you think you can shoot love? Uh, could Ansel Adams shoot trees? Yes. Well, as long as we give them what they want, or we convince them that what they want is what we give them, we'll have a client for years to come. I trust you two. And you've never let me down... yet. Is she back yet? No, but she just called, and, um... Hi, Meg. Hi, Tina. Um, it's Deena. Right, sorry. Okay. So, that's your type. I could see it. - You think? - Oh, yeah. That is definitely your type. Easy, tiger. Let him come to you. And it wouldn't hurt if you wore something a little less... - Brown? - I was gonna say awful. Call my guy Frederico, he'll hook you up. I'll text you his number. See? I don't bite. Huh. Hi. Looks like we'll be the only two lonely souls working till Christmas. - I'm not... lonely. - Mm. Oh. Yeah. Oh, no, I didn't mean, like, "Lonely" lonely. I have a lot of Christmas stuff I've been invited to. Yeah, I'm... No, I'm sure you do. I just, I don't know. I thought that-- Congratulations on your Chelsea Diamonds account. Like you need another excuse to not have a life. But we'll make up for it by going out to lunch. Right now. Uh, I'll be back in an hour. Uh, okay. Uh... There's, there's cold Chinese. Thanks, Meg. Maybe you're being too picky. Easy for you to say. You have Marcos. He's gorgeous. Yeah, he is, isn't he? And, okay, maybe I am a little lonely. But what unattached person isn't this time of year? "Happy Holidays" is in your face everywhere you look. But I'm fine, I swear. Hey, watch where you're going! - Sorry. - What's your problem? Oh, yeah, I see you're fine. Shoot. I should be grateful. I know. I have the perfect friend. This is true. I have the perfect job, even if it doesn't actually give me enough time to have a personal life. Agreed. I have the perfect apartment. It's cute, right? It is, even though it's one avenue west of relevant. You know that. I guess I shouldn't complain. I mean, I kind of have the perfect life. The one thing I don't have is... - Him. - Hm. Guys like that don't really exist. Sure they do, come to Oeuvre with me tonight and you'll see a whole room full of walking, talking mannequins. Great. If you're looking to meet him, tonight's your chance. Plus, there's no such thing as perfect when it comes to men. I bet those two had a fight before they even got into that glass case. Oh, I love her hat. Hm. We better get back. Hm. Yeah, I like that. An interior shoot. We can get a, like, a living room set up. Oh, we'll get a fireplace for the studio. And, ah! We can get Hans to be our model. - He's so-- - Bland? Uh, I think you mean blond, and stunning. What? Just hear me out for a second, okay? Just listen, okay? What if we did something completely different? Milo, we don't have time to do anything different than this. I know, I just, I want this campaign to be interesting, like, uh, like the Clayton campaign. Yeah, the one where you threw motor oil all over the studio to make it look artsy, and it forced us to lose our $2000 deposit? Yeah, and then Clayton became the number one steel-toed boot in New York City. I saw them in Brooklyn the other day, at a coffee shop, on the Morgan stop. - Okay. - I just... I think it would be so great if we could shoot some real people for once, you know? Like, take a look at those. I don't know about the love that you've seen, but the love that I know, it's flawed. True, but that's not what people want. People want a perfect life. They want a perfect wedding, a perfect first date. - A perfect Christmas. - A perfect brainwash! - A perfect kiss. - Okay, I'll give you that one. Because nobody wants a sloppy kiss. - Thank you. - But the rest of it... It's, it's, it's fantasy, it's ridiculous. Exactly. People want fantasy. No. That is what makes people miserable, it's trying to pursue that. I disagree! People torture themselves thinking that there's such a thing as a perfect life when, I'm sorry, frankly, there's not. Exactly! Which is why we sell them the fantasy. So that people can live through these ads. But they don't live through the ads. They... die a little inside, because we're selling them these unattainable, unrealistic lies. Reality? For the most part, it's... It's messy. And it's complicated, and sloppy. And I think that if you look hard enough, that, that you can find the sweetness and, and the beauty, and the truth... in almost anything. Hi! Sorry. Deena said to be in this dress and in a cab no later than 10:00. Oh, boy. Uh, thanks, Meg. Yeah, thanks, Meg. Hey! You going to the, uh, the club? You mean Oeuvre? You know, you can come. Deena put me and a plus one on the list at the door. Uh, no. Thank you. That's not really my scene. Okay. Uh, hey... you look really great. You mean, I don't look messy, complicated, and sloppy? Uh, no. You look pretty perfect, actually. Thanks. Have fun. Oh! Holly! Hi. - Hello. - Hi, Marcos. - How are you? - Good. Have you seen the guys in here? Oh, yeah, it looks like a cattle call for a Versace shoot. Hey, Holly, Holly. I have the perfect man for you. Okay. - Nico! Hey, Nico! - Hey, Marcos! How're you... I guess they got back together. Um... Javier. Hey, Javier! Meet Javier. Hello. - Where have you been? - I didn't mean it. Thanks for trying. I'll be at the bar. That's the best you can do? Ugh! - Hey. - How you doing? Can I have an Oeuvre-tini, please? - Oeuvre-tini. - Extra Oeuvre. You got it. Hey. Holly, I'm sorry about Marcos. But this place is crawling with guys. I'll keep my eye out. I think you need to keep an eye out on Marcos. What's up with that? If you want to leave, we can totally leave. Leave? Look, I know you haven't met anyone, but it's just because it's the holidays. So everyone's back with their exes, you know. Last week would have been a totally different story. I didn't mean leave for me. I meant leave for you. Marcos is all over that girl. Holly, Marcos is gorgeous. Of course girls are gonna be all over him. But really, after all is said and done, he's a one-woman man, and that one woman is me. I let him have his fun. I'm generous. Ooh, baby, that's good! - Dance with me. - Okay. What? You're here! Yeah. I don't know why. Well, you were right. This is so not your scene. Well, I didn't, I didn't know if I'd have another chance to be your plus one at Club Oeuvre again, so... We need proof that you were actually here tonight. What? We need proof you were actually here tonight! Yeah. Say, "Oeuvre." That place was horrible. Oh, Holly Maddux, welcome to the dark side. I am really glad that you thought so too. I hope none of your hipster Williamsburg friends caught you going in there. Uh, if they did, I'm gonna say that it was on a dare. Oh, that's why you came. You thought I was daring you. Hey, I... I know I'm tough on you at work. It's just, I've been there longer. I know what the client wants, okay? I know what sells. It's my job to know. So just trust me, okay? I trust you. Of course I trust you. I... And I'm capable of compromise, which I would like you to know, so maybe there's such a thing as a happy medium. Maybe. Um... Oh. Um... - Yeah. - I should go. Okay, uh, I... Yeah, no, I should... Oh, um... I'll see you at the office. Okay, yeah. Uh, okay, boss. Morning, Milo. What's up? I... have a massive Oeuvre-tini hangover. - How about you? - Totally. Uh, the real reason that I'm calling is, I need you to sign off on something. What? Too afraid to ask me face to face? No, I just had a genius idea, and I needed to call you immediately. Um, what about using Roger as our model? I know he's a little edgy, but-- Roger? Snake tattoo Roger? No, Milo, absolutely not. But you're not thinking this through. Milo... - Okay. - That was easy. Yeah, wait till we're face to face. I'll see you in a bit. Oh! Oh, ahh! Hello? Hello? - Oh, my gosh. Miss? - Whoa! I hope she's okay. Miss? Miss? She's moving. Miss? Don't worry. I'm here. I've got you. Oh... Are you okay? I think so. Your hands, they're freezing. Let me warm 'em up. Oh, it's nice and warm. Thanks. I'm Bo. Bo. I'm Holly. May I walk you to where you're going? Uh... sure, I guess. That'd be nice. Hey, uh, what happened to your hair? Ah! I just met the most amazing guy. Okay, gotta hear this. I was walking to work, like I do every single day. And the streets were so crowded. And I ran smack into these way too cheerful carolers. And I tripped, fell on the pavement-- - Are you okay? - Yup. Fine. Amazing, actually. But I must have blacked out for a second, because when I came to, there was Bo. Bo? Bo. It was like a fairy tale, and he rescued me. I mean, one minute, I was passed out on the ground, and the next minute, I'm staring up at the most gorgeous blue eyes. - Oh. - He helped me to my feet. I am telling you, a real life Prince Charming. Did you get his number? No. Better. He asked for mine. Whoa! Is that dolphin? Uh, sorry. Uh, Holly, I, seriously, I need you to take a look at this. I know that you nixed Roger as a model, but I came up with some ideas that I think-- - No. - Just listen. It's a compromise, okay? It's a happy medium. They're, they're pretty, but they also look real. No, real is not the way we're going at all, Milo. Nope. That's not what true romance looks like. Um, it's not? No. True romance is fantasy. Fairy tales come true. I know that for a fact. All right, but last night, you said that-- I think it's probably him. Hello? - Oh, hi, Bo. - Mm. Yeah, I'm feeling much better. Thank you so much for asking. Um... Saturday? Tomorrow? Um, let me just check my calendar. He wants to go out tomorrow. Oh! Yes, there is fantasy and romance. - There's just no dignity. - Um... You know what, actually, it looks like I am free tomorrow. Noon? Noon is perfect. Okay. See you at Chiano's. We do sound like dolphins. You must be Holly. Oh, well, yes. Oh, didn't I tell you she's beautiful? Your table's waiting for you. Hey, you two are gonna make great parents. Congratulations on the baby. You look even more beautiful than when we first met. Well, I was lying passed out on the sidewalk. Thank you. This place looks wonderful. Well, I'm just glad that you felt well enough to come today. I... I can't believe I did that. I'm not usually that clumsy. Oh, it has nothing to do with being clumsy. You wouldn't believe how many people I've seen slip on the icy sidewalks. You're just being sweet. Whether it's the mob of shoppers or the ice, walking the streets can be dangerous this time of year. That's funny. I'm serious. Oh. You know, maybe my parents have it right. They don't even come to the city for the holidays anymore. They spend it at their timeshare in the Caribbean. - Wow, that sounds amazing. - Mm-hm. But you're here. You don't want to go? Well, my career doesn't really give me much time to have a real life. I spent the last three years working on this promotion that I just got, and now I have to convince my bosses that they didn't make a mistake, and it's, all of a sudden, busy at the office for some reason. And, oh, God, sorry. I'm rambling. What do you do? I'm in advertising. Really? I love advertising. Really? You're gonna laugh, but ever since I was a kid I've done a bunch of ads for... surf boards. Back to school. Vitamins. And slacks. You're really good at that. Thank you. Dom Perignon mimosas. Just as you requested. I also took the liberty of ordering their signature dish. I hope you like gnocchi. I love gnocchi. Thank you. To fairy tale beginnings. Yes. Oh, um, sorry. It's work. But it's Saturday. I thought I had you all to myself today. You do. I can take care of this on Monday. Hey, Milo, got your pepperoni and mushroom pizza here, man. Piping hot. Well, it's warm. Kinda. Thanks, Frankie. Appreciate it, man. Don't care what Yelp says. It's the best lunch, brunch and dinner in New York. - Have a good day, man. - You too. Come on, Holly. - You live here? - Yeah. I walk down this street everyday. I have to admit, I've seen you walk by. Couldn't help but notice. Hey, Stan. You're up and about. Uh, finally, thanks for taking Shirley to her doctor's appointment the other morning. This sciatica. I cannot even get out of a chair. Oh, it was nothing. Anytime. I'm just glad to see you're feeling better. Hey, lay off that rumba, Stan. So, would you like to see my place? Sure. You'll have to forgive me. It lacks a woman's touch. Oh, don't worry. You should see my apartment. Whoa. This place is great! Yeah, it's not bad. You know, if you're gay, you can just tell me. It's fine. We can be friends. I'm not gay. And I'd rather not just be friends. Make yourself comfortable. Huh! So, what do you do for a living? Well, I was in retail. Really? Yeah, but you find yourself a slave to the seasons. And you can get stuck in one place. Yeah, I know what you mean. So, I recently got out of it. Now I spend my time traveling the world, doing extreme sports and volunteering for charities. Wow. And you do all of that alone? Yeah. But it wasn't always that way. I just didn't have my head screwed on straight when we were dating. I guess she just wasn't the right one for me. So, who, in theory, would be the right one? Hm, the right one. Well, she'd have to be ambitious, getting work texts on the weekend. She'd have to be fun. Be up for a spontaneous brunch, even if she did whack her head just the day before. Yeah, that hurt. But it, it was Chiano. And she'd have to have great taste. Yeah, I have... Would you look at that? Our lips fit perfectly together. Would you look at that? Hey, it's Milo again. I just texted you to confirm the shoot, but I haven't heard back from you. Um, we can talk about it on Monday, but we do need to set that so we don't lose the studio. Um, and... Oh! I got hold of a couple tickets to this art gallery opening in Dumbo tonight. Um, I assumed that you wouldn't want to go because it's over the bridge, but I thought I'd try. Uh... anyway, just, uh, give me a call if you feel like it. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Thanks. I haven't heard from you all weekend. I assume that means good things. This is him. He's gorgeous. Oh, look at his teeth. - Who is that? - Holly's new boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. He's gorgeous. Hey, Holly, did you get my voicemails? Oh, yeah. You can confirm the shoot. Even though your eyes are shut, you guys look so good together. Okay, does he have any friends? What? What about Marcos? Yeah, things aren't so hot with Marcos. What happened? I think he cheated on me. - No. - With Miss Brazil. Ugh! What happened to one-woman man? I guess he's a two-woman man. - Ugh! - Dee, I'm so sorry. I just... I knew it was too good to be true. I give up. I'm not dating anymore. - Not dating anymore? - No. That's not the Deena Demaria I know. It isn't? Who gets us in first to the private Stella McCartney sale every year? - Me. - Really? And who's the person who gets us five invitations to New York Fashion Week after parties, one from Mr. Tom Ford himself? - Me again. - That's right. You're smart, you're beautiful. You're the best friend I could have ever asked for, and you can do so much better than Marcos. Please dump him. Yeah, but not everyone trips and falls and wakes up to Prince Charming. - Yeah, but-- - I can't. I can't do another single's Christmas this year. Being single at Christmas is not that bad. You just say that now because you have someone. - And I want someone. - Someone better! So, you're gonna dump him, right? - Well... - Deena! It's almost Christmas. And New Year's, it's, it's right around the corner. Who's gonna kiss me? I'll kiss you at New Year's. But Marcos, he's so hot. He's a hot, hot, hot model. And he can get us in anywhere. But you're miserable with him. He's only gonna hurt you again. I'll dump him after New Year's. Maybe. Holly, I'm fine. Seriously. Deena is always fine. Uh, no, it's totally, I mean... You're not even listening to me. It's not that I didn't want to go to Brooklyn. And it was very sweet of you to invite me, thank you. I meant to call you back. I just got caught up with stuff. Yeah, I heard. Heard what? Uh, nothing. Just that you got swept off your feet or something, literally, or... Word travels pretty fast. But, uh, you know what, don't worry about it. You probably wouldn't have liked the art show that much, anyway. Actually, I'm not sure if you know what I like. I think I know what you like. I think you like neat and tidy and something with perfect teeth. Okay, look, I know you're mad, okay? I'm sorry I didn't call you back. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Um... here. Why don't we use these two? Truce. Uh, yeah, sure. Truce. Good. I'll have Meg book these models. Uh, okay, cool. Do you want to get some lunch? Uh, I actually already made plans. Sorry. Uh, okay. I'll see you after. Are those any good? Probably on Friday, when they were made. Now they're just stale and a little dusty, but free. Yum. Where's Holly? I figured you guys would have lunch plans. Nope. She is with Bo. Bo? Is his name really Bo? Like, Bo, like a French guy, or Bo, like Bobo the Clown? Whoa. What is this? Do I sense a little jealousy? Of Bo? No, definitely not. Um... you know, she... She just seems pretty wrapped up in a guy that she just met, that's all. Uh-huh. And we're in the middle of a campaign, and she's not, she's not texting me back in a timely fashion. So, how am I supposed to get any work done? Well, I'm happy for her, and I understand. As long as she fits in at least one lunchtime shopping trip with me a week... Oh, yeah, 'cause that's important. Okay, Mr. Hipster Photographer. Don't forget you work at the same company as I do, so don't get all artsy on me. Well, maybe, I'm just a little too complicated for you. Complicated? Please. I have a boyfriend who's a model. - That's complicated. - Oh, that's classic. Blame him, because you know what, no offense, but in my experience, most of the complication usually comes from the women's camp. Oh. Really? Yeah, women are fickle. They worry way too much about appearance. They think that fairy tales are real. She thinks that perfection is this attainable goal. She goes to these stupid nightclubs looking for these guys that, frankly, don't exist-- - She. She who? - What? You said "She," twice in your little rant. I did? No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. I heard it. Well, okay, they. I meant you. You. All of you. Your entire gender. You just... A lot of the times, you're blind to that fact that something better, dare I say, perfect. It could be standing right in front of you. Well, you can tell Janet, otherwise known as that succubus who's ruining my life, she's not getting any more money out of me in the divorce! - Not like him. - No. Not, not like him, no. You know what? Don't worry. Holly's first priority will always be work. It's not that I think that she should work more. I just think that Bo is-- Not complicated enough? That would be one way to put it. I don't know, maybe Milo was right. Wait, you won't listen to me, but you'll take dating advice from Milo? He's not nearly as big a moron as I thought. Plus, he's right. I mean, there really might be someone right there in front of me. I'm too caught up in Marcos's drama to even notice. Losing the drama wouldn't be a bad idea. Well, you have another amazing night with Bo. Maybe I'll go see if Milo wants to get a pedicure with me. Very funny. Are you gonna see Marcos? - Maybe. - Just be careful. I will. Night. Oh! It's tofu, but you'll swear that it's duck. Wow! This looks straight out of Food & Wine Magazine. No, but they did interview me about my soufflé. I could barely cook a frozen dinner properly. Not that they're that great, but that and takeout have kept me alive my entire adult life. I know did the toast last time, but there's just so much I want to say to you. To fairy tales coming true. Fairy tales... again. Mm. - Oh! Oh! Oh! - Oh! Okay. Oh, I'm so sorry! - Okay, okay, nobody panic. - No, um... - Do you have some baking soda? - Don't touch it, don't. I get stains out all the time, this will be okay. That's an Yves Delorme linen. This... This is fine. Oh, Saint-Louis crystal. Um... I'm so sorry about your tablecloth. But I had a great time tonight. That to-ducky was delicious. Thanks. I've got a great set of tofu moulds. Are you sure you have to go back to the office tonight? I'm on a deadline. We have to get this stuff done by Christmas Eve. We'll be lucky if we even get the shoot pulled together in time. I know. I just love spending time with you. Remember, you did say you loved ambitious girls. One more thing. I want to see you tomorrow night. I have a surprise for you. No more late night at the office? It's just really tough right now. I'm behind at work, and I'm never behind at work. And are you sure you wanna see me again so soon? Holly, when you know, you know, and I know. Hey, how about I just bring dinner by your place? Okay. Deal. Mwah. No more drama. No more drama. - Marcos! - Mm! Hey, baby. I'm glad you're here. Are you angry? Are you insane? Of course I am. I walk in, and you're joining the mile-high club with Lufthansa over there. But you weren't here yet. And you weren't in the taxi with me, but I didn't make out with the cab driver. You know, baby, I thought we had an understanding. Marcos doesn't date just one woman, hmm? Then Deena is done with Marcos. "Done with Marcos. Done with Marcos"? "Done with Marcos"? Hello. - Hi. - Hi. It's okay. There'll be somebody in front of me. All I have to do is open my eyes and look. No. Well, I'm glad you broke up with him, Deena. And there will be someone right in front of you when you least expect it. Milo was right. Ah! Oh... What was I right about? Ah! Geez, Milo. You scared me. Oh, nothing, nothing. Are you gonna be okay? Okay, bye. - What are you doing in here? - Sorry. You weren't supposed to see this till the morning. Um, here. Read it. "When work and play click." How'd you get all my old ad campaigns in here? I found this site online that will turn all your old photos into View-Master disks. So, I thought it might be fun for you to see the last couple of years in 3D. And I took a bunch of those photos, so it's... an early Christmas gift. That's really sweet. Wait, is this a bribe? Because I already met you halfway on the models. No, it's not. It, just, no one set up a Secret Santa. So, you're my Secret Santa? I guess so. What are you doing here so late? Well, someone has to get this stupid campaign off the ground before Christmas Eve. - Okay. - Well, yeah. Ah, Sacco's delivery. - I gotta go. - Pepperoni? - And mushroom. - Oh... I'll save you a slice. Mm. Yup, the studio's booked and the shoot is all set for tomorrow. Nothing to worry about, Livingston, you are going to love what we came up with. Yup, and so will Chelsea Diamonds, trust me. Okay, bye. Welcome to my... place. Hi, I'm Carol. Bo's mom. This is Mike, his dad. Hi, you like veal piccata? Oh, who doesn't like veal piccata, dad? Well, that's great, 'cause I'm making it for you. Oh, well... okay. Isn't she great? Bo, you didn't tell me your parents were coming. That's the surprise I was talkin' about. Surprise! Hey, dad? Can you come in here for a minute? Oh, sure, son. Hey. Grab the other end of that couch. Oh, yeah. Okay, sure. If I'd known you were coming, I would have... renovated. Okay, that is so much better. I'll say. Hey, mom. When's dinner gonna be ready? About an hour. How can you find anything without it being alphabetized? I don't know. - Isn't this fun? - Yes, fun. You are so right, Bo. Just look at her. Right, Mike? She sure is pretty, Carol, pretty as a picture in a magazine. Hm. - Oh, a toast. - Ah. To fairy tale endings. And grandkids. Mm. Mm. So, you're in advertising. Boy, that's an industry for the young. I guess so. You know, Mike and I were very much in demand, back in the day. - In demand? - Oh, yes. They thought we had the perfect look. They were always pairing us with every season, every sale. - That's how we met. - Yeah. - We worked a lot back then. - Mm-hmm. - Doing what, exactly? - Show her. - No... - Show her, go ahead. - Show her. Come on. - No. - No, really. - Oh, come on. What the heck. - Come on. - Okay. - You don't have to... - All right. Let's try, um... Presidents' Day sale. Oh, Presidents' Day. Okay, yeah. Huh? - Okay, let's switch it up. - That felt good. What do you say, labor day? - Huh? Okay. - Good, good. Here we go. Is this like a family thing? Shh. - Ah. Shake it off, baby. - Whoo! - Oh, yeah. Last one. - All right, let's... What? - Close out. Everything must go. - Ooh, close out. - Yeah! Come on! - That's a tough one. - You can do it. - All right, I'm game. Go. - Oh! - Oh, my God, honey! - That was great! - You still got it, baby. Oh, it's just like the old days. - Oh, you were terrific. - You handsome devil, you. Oh, my goodness. Thanks, sweetheart. Anyone want more veal? Holly, honey, you coming out? Mom's servin' up cherries jubilee for dessert. I'll be right there. Holly and I hope to have a home one day that we could fill with three kids, a golden retriever. Maybe a carriage house in the back, where you two can stay as long as you like. Maybe even move in. Oh! What's wrong? What you were saying to your parents while I was in the bathroom, about us and our future... I know, I just... I like to tell them good news. It makes them happy. They don't seem to need any help being happy, from what I can tell. Mom brought The Sound of Music. Family tradition. Just pop it right in. We'll be out before you can say "Edelweiss." Don't you think this is all going a little bit fast? I know, I know it has happened fast. Isn't it wonderful? But three kids, Bo, and a golden retriever? You'll tell them things even if they're not true? It's just... It's what I dream of with you. I know it might be wishful thinking, but isn't it what you dream of too? The perfect life with the perfect someone? Yes... but-- Holly, the sound's not working. Sister Margaret is singing, but we can't hear her. I'll be right there. Plus, isn't this one dream that could become a reality? Dinner was just wonderful, and it was so nice to meet you both, so soon. Thank you. Sweet girl. You're too kind. She is gonna fit in just fine with this family. I think so too, dad. - Mwah. - Mwah. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. Hey. Here's the whole shot list. I emailed you a copy as well. We just need to make sure we get all the fireplace shots before we move on. You got it, boss. Uh, here. It's pumpernickel. That's my favorite! Hey, is that the Midwest? Uh, yeah. That's Indiana, actually. Reminds me of Ohio, where I grew up. Really? I went on this month-long road trip and I found this little town that just reminded me of all the little towns I felt like I always wanted to grow up in, when I was a kid. Mm. Ohio wasn't all that exciting. Uh, a backyard is very exciting to a seven-year-old that grows up in a Brooklyn apartment building. I bet you were the terror of the building elevators. How would you know? How were you able to get a whole month off? It was right before I started here. I, um, I needed a break after I left my job at the AP. You were an AP photographer? I didn't know that. Yeah. I loved it. I... Like, I got to take pictures of people and just try and tell their stories, you know? But... it was just a 24-7 job. And I never got to have a life, and... Not that Livingston's giving you one now. I saw you here late the other night. Yeah, well, that's 'cause you were here working late too. You guys better get going. The van's ready. Thanks, Meg. Um, I'll see you down there. - Thank you. - Uh, yeah. You're good for her, you know? What? Can I have a bagel? Uh, yeah. No problem. It's gonna be tight, we got a lot of set-ups and not a lot of time. But I know you can do it. Yeah. I thrive in chaos. Where is everybody? Uh, I don't know. I confirmed. I swear I did. Hey... Hello? Dolan! Where is everybody? We confirmed. Uh, your guy cancelled. He called this morning. He said he found a better place to do the shoot. He was gonna hire his own photographer. Blah-blah-blah. I said, "I have your deposit, so you do what you want." He said, "Perfect," and hung up. There must be some mistake. Who called to cancel? - Did they give you a name? - Uh, Bo. He did not leave a last name. What? Bo? Yeah, Bo or Joe. No, it was Bo. Bo? You didn't think it was odd that someone you'd never spoken to before was calling to cancel? You didn't think to confirm? Well, that's what deposits are for, you know? Right. Come on, Milo. Okay, go back to the office and see if you can rebook the shoot somewhere, anywhere, for tomorrow. Our jobs are on the line on this one. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. Okay, relax, just-- Relax? How could you do this to me? Are you crazy? I'm on a deadline! I can't reschedule this. We lost our deposit. We're gonna lose this account. I am going to lose my job. Are you trying to ruin my career? No. No, I'm trying to help your career. Now, listen, just listen to me. I got Dex Dearborn to do the shoot. We already have a photographer to do the shoot. Yeah, wai... Uh, wait. You got Dex Dearborn? Five time IPA award winner, Dex Dearborn? Yeah, it turns out my apartment used to be his old studio. Oh, he did his best work here. Something about "The artistic juices flow better here"? I don't know. But he insisted that we do the shoot here. That's why I did it. But his rate is outrageous. There's no way we're gonna be able to afford that. Well, he owes me a favor. Trust me, it's gonna be amazing. I, ah... I'm... I'm sure it would be amazing, but this is my shoot, my job, and actually, I'm really good at my job, and you've just put me and my company in a really awkward position. Is any of this sinking in? I'm just trying to help. Uh... Well, it's too late to book another studio. And it is Dex Dearborn, so... All right, here we go. Let's show off those pretty baby diamonds. Those Chelsea Diamonds. That's it. It's Christmas in America. Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. Show it to me. Yes, that's right. That's gorgeous. Look at you two... What can I do? How can I help? This is awful. Terrible. Please don't fire me. I swear when I left work last night, everything was fine. - Please, I'll make sure-- - Meg! Meg, look. I am not gonna fire you. It's actually going okay. This is wonderful. Beautiful. Give me some juice. Put it all right here. Energy here, up here. - Didn't I tell you? Huh? - You're burning for each other. - Oh, yes... - This just might work. Use the tree. It's all happening. It's gorgeous. Beautiful. Great. Now take her hand. Like this? Like a man. Like a man would take a hand. Okay, great. And you... Hi. Hello? - Who, me? - Yeah, you. So, your hand over here needs to look a little more natural. Like a natural hand. Like a human being. Has a human ever held her hand ever like that? Never mind. Let's just, let's start over. Doesn't look like a hand... Okay, I'll cut that out later. Okay, you know what? You know what? Never mind. Let's not do this. Um, hey. All right, let's do the big proposal shot. How about that? Okay, okay. Wonderful. Great, so good. Okay. So, you... Uh, blondie. You're gonna stand over by the Christmas tree. And you, Einstein... Oh, you're already down on one knee. That's great. This is the greatest moment of your lives, all right? You've never been happier than this. Okay? So show me love. Um, it would help if you could turn to her. Great. Thank you. Now, I want you to... This is the happiest day of your lives, all right? I want you to look at each other like you're so happy. All right? You've never been happier, all right? I want you to look at her like your love will stand the test of time. Okay, you're about to pop the question, right? But you're hopeful, but sure. You're strong, but vulnerable. You know what? I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. Holly? Uh, yes? I'm sorry, babe, I can't, I can't work with this. This isn't happening. You know what? You know what? Bo? Bo, hi. Bo, can you... Can you show this idiot how it's done? - Hi. - This is great. Yeah, this is great. This is great. Yeah, it's better already. Um... Oh, no, I... Oh, I'm sorry. Bo... What? No. - I... Oh. - Oh. This is wonderful, actually. This is great. Wendell, ring. Can I have the ring? Get the ring, now. This is so great. Now, look into each other's eyes. Oh, this is magical. Wow. Okay, okay. What is happening now? Eh, excuse me? The call time was 4:00 p.m. - Brandi? - This didn't take very long. - What is she, a size eight? - Who are you? You said we were gonna spend the holidays together! You said, "Every holiday from now on"! New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day, Cinco De Mayo! Hey, that's my tree! Absolutely not! All right, we're out of here. We're out of here. Stay, stay! No, no, no. We're not finished yet! We're not finished yet! This is not what it looks like. Will you just stop? - Leave my tree alone. - I gave you everything! I stood by you and you just disappeared! Well, I'm not gonna be ignored. Oh, my God! Meg! Ow... Give me five minutes. What was that? Who was that? My ex. She's crazy about me. What can I say? Oh... - Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so. So you're just gonna let her do that and then leave? You didn't really want her to stay? Does that mean this is a wrap? Yes, that's a wrap. Let's go. Are you sure you're okay? Holly, wait. Holly, I can fix this. Good morning, Holl... Oh. Was it something I said? No, I heard the shoot didn't go so well yesterday. Something about her boyfriend Bo messing it up. - What? - Sounds crazy. Oh, boy. - Holly! - Livingston, hi. Well, how's it going? I'm fine, thanks. No, not you. The Chelsea campaign. How did the shoot go? When can I see it? Soon. Everything is right on schedule. Well, good. I'm glad to hear it. But, look, there's a lot riding on this campaign for you and the company. I know. She knows. I'm going mad. Milo? Got some really good shots here. - Some convincing stuff. - That is not what it looks like. Can you turn that off please? I'm so sorry for that stunt that Bo pulled. If it makes you feel any better, it was a total and complete disaster. We don't have one usable shot. I don't know what we're gonna do. What we're gonna do? We were supposed to work on this campaign together. I was supposed to do that shoot. I put days of prep into it. I know. It was crazy. I didn't have a choice. Yes, you did. You could have told him no, but you didn't. We could have rescheduled the shoot for today, but you didn't, it's like Bo's got this spell on you. I tried. I don't get you. It's like this constant pursuit of perfection with you. You'll do anything for it. That's not true. You know, it's funny, I, um... I found some of your early drafts, some of the stuff that you just threw out, and, you know what? It's really good. The real you is so much more interesting than you think. You're just so wrapped up in what everybody else thinks, you don't notice. Official drink tickets have arrived! In case you wanna get your drink on at the company Christmas party. Oh... Hey, uh, sorry. Um, am I interrupting something? - No. - No. I think I hear my phone. Are you gonna go to the party? Probably not. I have to stay here and fix the campaign. No. Don't skip it. Just... I already uploaded most of the pictures that Dex took. So, um, I'll see what I can salvage. Think you can make something work? I always do, don't I? Yeah, you do. Kind of amazing, actually. Uh, that's Bo. - I have to take this. - Of course you do. Just break up with him. Just break up with him. Bo, we have to talk. I couldn't do it! I chickened out. I couldn't break up with him. It was like the words wouldn't come out of my mouth. Maybe he does have a spell over me. Well, the heart wants what the heart wants, doesn't it? I wonder if Milo's bringing a date to the party. Milo? Why are you asking about Milo? What? Who's that? Milo. He sent over mockups from the shoot. Check that out! Oh, that Milo is a miracle worker. Wow. It's Bo. He's early. Let me get that. I'll give him a piece of my mind. You watch and learn. Oh, you must be Bo. I should have brought two of these. Aren't you the sweetest little thing? Hi, Bo. We're almost ready. We just have to get our coats. Oh! I keep forgetting you moved the friggin' couch. You'll get used to it. Here, let me. Oh, thank you. Beautiful coat. Burberry? Yes, indeed. I remember two years ago when everyone was wearing these. Two years ago? Holly has told me so much about you, and that fool of an ex-boyfriend. I'm so glad you got rid of him. Oh, thank you. Everyone knows models should only date other models. You'll find someone more your match. - What is he saying? - Yeah. Did he just... If they're doing karaoke, Feliz Navidad is my song. My accent is excelente. Let's just try and have a fun night, shall we? You know, how about some champagne? That sounds great. Great sounds! You really got this party rockin'. You, uh, using Serato DJ software or Traktor? Traktor. Cool, cool. Yeah, um... I know everyone likes Serato's better, but I learned on Traktor. Me too. - I like your dress and-- - Mm! Keep your big mouth shut, and if you look at another woman, I'll scratch your eyes out. - Brandi baby, I-- - Don't "Brandi baby" me. And knock off that fake accent. It's not fake. Hah, right. Stay by my side and look pretty. I've got a plan. Three glasses of champagne, please. - Excuse me. - I'm sorry. Oh, hey, you're, uh, you're Holly's boyfriend, right? Yeah, Bo. Milo. Milo... Milo. I know that name. The photographer. Yeah, that's me. The photographer. That's gotta be a blast, huh, man? Well, actually, at the moment, I'm doing a lot of fixing another photographer's work, so if you call that a blast... Hm, that's too bad. I know this great photographer. Dex Dearborn. You know his work? Intimately. I love his stuff. He just knows what he wants and goes for it. I guess that's how the best get to the top in life, huh? Yeah. Look who's talking to Bo. Maybe I should go save Milo. Milo... is a big boy. He can handle himself. Look over there. That's Marcos. He's with Bo's crazy ex-girlfriend, Brandi. No, no, no, no, no... Just breathe. Breathe. - Okay. - You got this. All right, well, I got some thirsty ladies I gotta bring these back to, so... Hey, you know, when you're taking pictures of the party later, can you get a good one of me and Holly? Thanks. - Here we go. - Oh, thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I just met Milo. Great guy. - Really? - Yeah. He's gonna take a picture of us later. Oh, I've got great news. I've just booked a flight for us to Vermont for New Year's. You booked a flight for New Year's? Looks like you two have a lot to talk about. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go murder... mingle. Mingling. We're gonna stay at a bed and breakfast just outside of Stowe. They make the most divine organic chevre from a herd of Dwarf Nigerian goats, you are gonna love it. How do you know that I'm gonna love it, exactly? And then, two days of snowboarding. I don't like snowboarding. Honey, the powder is gonna be packed. It'll be perfect. And I know the most romantic fondue restaurant. - Really? - It's in an actual tree house. We should move in together. I think that's a good idea. Then we'll hop on a plane to Kona, and we'll play 18 holes. Sounds like a good way to celebrate a wonderful year. Well, it has been. And how about those up-and-comers, eh? Fantastic, in my day, the rookies would always blow at least one campaign. Oh, trust me, I remember. Not anymore. Not on my watch, pal. Livingston Gunn! Livingston Gunn. The man behind the name. Hi, I'm Brandi. That's Marcos. Oh, hi, Brandi. So, uh, what brings you to our little party? - The champagne. - Oh, well... Give her some champagne. Oh, thank you. You really do call all the shots, don't you? I was actually in a photoshoot for you guys yesterday. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. This might be the champagne talking, but it was a total disaster. - A disaster? - Mm. I hate to say this, but the exec in charge, she was a mess, she lost all control. Well, it couldn't have been one of our execs. Oh, maybe I have it wrong. Maybe you're right. Her name was Holly Maddux. I'm sorry. Hi, Livingston. I just happened to overhear you. What exactly were you doing at this shoot? - Model. - Really? Funny, I don't remember seeing your unremarkable face in any of the photos that were taken. What exactly were you modeling? - Clothes. - That's odd. It was a shoot for diamonds. Chelsea Diamonds, to be exact. - Who was the photographer? - Uh, curly hair. - I don't remember his name. - Mm. - What agency are you with? - Ford. Who's your rep? Um, Barry Weiner. Wrong. Barry Winer left Ford six months ago. Look, I don't know who you are, or what you have against Holly, but she's one of our top execs, and everyone knows that. She doesn't blow shoots! - Excuse us. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey. So why don't you just leave, before I tell everyone that you're wearing a fake, knock-off Balenciaga? Security! It's happening. We... have a crasher. No! Unh-huh, no. No... No! Bo! Bo! Bo! We belong together, Bo! No! We never talked about going to Vermont for New Year's, and yet, you went ahead and bought the tickets. And do you know how many times I have stubbed my toe on my couch since you moved it? These Manolos were white when I bought them. That's blood. Hey, mi amore. I miss you. Marcos misses Deena. - Oh, honey... - Yeah. Deena doesn't miss Marcos. Security! We have another. - All right, everyone. - Baby... It is time to announce the holiday decorating contest winner. All right. Look at this beauty. Huh? Okay, a little drummer roll, please. Get it? Little Drummer Boy? No one? No? Oh, okay. And, uh, the winner... for his fresh approach to garland and judicious use of twinkle lights... Freddie Ferguson! Whoo! Yes! Big hand for Freddie, guys. Up next is the silent night award, and it goes to our chattiest assistant, Mallory Weisel. It's so obvious. He is totally wrong for her. Right, well, I know that and you know that, but does she know that? She knows. She may not know she knows, but she knows. So then what am I supposed to do? Go over there and, uh, save her from Prince Charming. But that's not how it works in the fairy tales, is it? I mean, you're not supposed to save the girl from Prince Charming. For crying out loud. This is not a fairy tale. That's a nightmare, okay? Walk over there, take her in your arms. Kiss her. Wake her up! - But what if she doesn't-- - Milo! Instructions were... walk, take her in your arms, kiss her, okay? Go kiss her, Milo. Come on. Thanks, Deena. Ah, men. - Bartender. - Bartender. - Sorry. - Sorry. Hi. I'm Kyle. Fifth floor. - Deena, third. - Good. Where are you from? Uh, fifth floor. - No, no, Australia. - Oh... Listen, um, can I buy you a drink? It's an open bar. I'll get you two then. Three. Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, um, where have you been this whole party? Truth be told, I'm not that great at mingling. So, I've just been, uh, here, standing right here. Right in front of me. And now, for the most hours worked overtime, the busy little elf award goes to... My boss! Holly Maddux! Yeah, Holly! This is our moment, Holly. Let's make this count. Oh, stop, stop! That was the perfect set-up to the perfect kiss. Why would you ruin it? I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not perfect. I'm far, far from it. I know you're not perfect, but we can fix you, together. But I don't wanna be fixed, Bo. What I'm finally realizing is that I want someone who wants me for who and what I am. And someone who appreciates my life for the sloppy, complicated mess that it is. Well... What? Bo, you are handsome, and tall, and charming-- Athletic. Athletic, sexy. You're perfect. I know. But I don't want perfect. And I don't want this perfect life that you've planned for us. It's empty, and superficial, and exhausting. I don't understand. I know you don't, Bo, and that's why I'm leaving you. Sweetie, you better run. That was a long speech, and Milo's got a big head start on you. Look what's out of season. Hah! Milo! Milo! You came back. You're awake. Where am I? In the hospital. You fell on your way to work a couple days ago and you whacked your head on the sidewalk. Do you remember? A couple days ago? Yeah. And... you are a total sleep talker, do you know that? You kept talking about a party and drinking brandy, and did you, did you have a dog named Bo? But there was a party, and Deena was there and Brandi and Bo, and you... - You. - Me, what? Well, look who's finally awake. Let's take a look here. Any dizziness, uh, blurred vision? No, everything is kind of clear to me now. All right, good. Well, you've got a minor concussion and, uh, some mild swelling. Gonna have to keep you in the hospital for one more night. Observation. You are more than welcome to stay again tonight, Mr. Maddux. - Mr. Maddux? - Yes, dear. - You stayed with me? - Yes. - Of course I did, sweetheart. - All right. I'm gonna check in on you later. Make sure she stays in bed, all right? Thanks, doctor. I told them that we were married so they would let me stay. The photoshoot! Did that happen? - Uh, yes. - Oh, no! No, I mean... We had to. Everything was already booked. And Livingston just put Deena in charge. But don't worry. It's all very glamorous. - It's very glitzy. - No! Ah, no. That's what I was afraid of. When is the ad due? Uh, tomorrow. Deena's probably uploading all the photos to the client-- Call her! Call her, please. Get her to stop. Ah! Whoa... Where's my laptop and my cell phone? My lipstick. Oh, God, we have a lot to do and not a lot of time to get it done. Oh, the internet is so slow here. The photos should be done any hour now. Holly, the photos look great, really. Milo did an excellent job. Hey, Darryl. Thanks for hooking us up. No problem, Ms. Maddux. That's what I do. - I hook things up. - Yeah. Hey, Meg, uh, once Darryl has us up and running, why don't you head back to the office with him and just hold down the fort? Um, really? Okay, I guess. Uh, Ms. Maddux? What is this, Grand Central Station? - Yes. - Oh, hi. I'm Kyle Benning. You emailed me and asked me to bring this rose. Weren't you Australian? What? No, I'm from Fresno. Never mind. That's for Deena. - Oh. - Huh, what? Holly, what are you doing? Deena, meet Kyle. Kyle, meet Deena. Give her the rose, Kyle. - Oh. - I don't want a rose. Holly, what is this, huh? Did the little knock on your head make you lose your mind? Who are you? - I'm Kyle. Fifth floor. - Uh-huh. - Okay. Uh-huh. - Fresno. - Deena? - Uh-huh. When you dump that Marcos, and you will, I just thought you and Kyle... Me and Kyle... Me and Kyle, what? Oh. Oh... See, you go head back with that little rose, and go on back to work, okay? Kyle from the fifth floor. - Deena. - He's still here. Why are you still here? - Right. Yes, okay. - I said go. There's nothing for you here. Go on. - Uh-huh. - Get... Girl, he's cute. Where did you find him? Oh, he's dreamy. Exactly. Huh? Okay, we're live. Here we go. See, these are beautiful, right? They're gorgeous. - Bye-bye. - Whoa, what are you doing? That's what you said you wanted. That's exactly what you wanted. Oh, maybe I don't want what I wanted anymore. - She has lost her mind. - Just trust me. Well, you know that we don't have time to book another shoot before the deadline, right? Why are you looking at those? You said you hated those. - I never hated these. - Really? How many of these do you have? Um... I mean, 500, give or take. Let's start diggin'. I'll get my laptop. Okay. Hey, I am leaving. It is 2:00 a.m., and I'm falling asleep. Thanks, Deena. - Night. - Bye, Deena. I appreciate what you're trying to do here, Holly, but we've looked through all these pictures twice and we haven't found it. I mean, I think maybe we should just use something from the shoot. Oh, it's in here. I know it. This is everything on your computer? Yeah, that's everything. What? What picture is this? Oh, it's our hands. It's us. What? I took it by mistake at Oeuvre, remember? Oh! Oh... It's beautiful. It's perfect. You're amazing. I know. I'll work on it in the morning. I just need a little more sleep.
