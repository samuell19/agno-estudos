Who's going first? Okay, I am. It's not bad. We agreed that we would never say that it's not bad. True. I like it. Just another way of saying it's not bad. I like it because... Because it's not bad. Let him speak. I like it because the film is not flat, not on one plan. "'Return From Africa' is a black and white film with words. "It's also at times a film about words. "Those we tell people, those we say in silence. "Saying a word is probably an act in itself. "It can also be considered a substitute to action. "Citing the words of others can lead to knowing oneself "or escaping oneself. "The quotes in this film are taken from the poems of Aim? C?saire - 'Notebook of a Return to the Native Land'." RETURN FROM AFRICA Hello? Yes. Hi. What time is it? I cycled over a huge nail. I didn't notice anything last night. But this morning the tyre was completely flat. It must have deflated during the night. Can you pick me up? Alright, I'll be waiting in front of the coffee shop. Thanks. Who was it? Emilio, the Spaniard. He busted a tyre. His bicycle. He's up early. What time is it? 6.15. - Are you leaving? - Yeah. I have pick him up. Good night. Cigarette number one, wonderful. # Politicians and merchants # All united, all in cahoots # Politicians and merchants # Go hand by hand after money. # "At the end of daybreak, life prostrate, "you don't know how to dispose of your aborted dreams. "The river of life desperately torpid in its bed "neither turgid nor low, "hesitant to flow, pitifully empty. "The impartial heaviness of boredom "distributing shade equally on all things. "At the end of daybreak, the famished hill. "And no-one knows better than this bastard hill "why the man committed suicide, "choking with a little help from his hypoglossal, "hamming in his tongue backward to swallow it." Why did the man commit suicide, choking with a little help from his hypoglossal, hamming in his tongue backward to swallow it? Hi, Emilio. What the hell are they doing? They're assholes. - A nail that big, goddammit! - Goddammit! Why don't bicycles have spare tyres like cars do? - Where would you put it? - I don't know. We should think of something. - It's fucked. - Like you say, it's fucked. Everything's fucked. Okay, let's go. Anywhere! Straight ahead! You can. But I can't. If we go on straight ahead, we'll end up in Spain. You're late! Emilio cycled over a big nail with his tyre, I had to pick him up. I don't give a toss about your stories! How am I going to count the hours now? What am I going to do? That's your problem. Yeah, of course. It's my problem! And when I pay you and you're short one franc, you should hear yourself! It's the rule of the game. The rule of the game... Nonsense! Come on, hurry up. Are they really in contact? Pretty much. There's barely 100 metres. Okay, Emilio and Marcel, you go to one side and you take care of the other. And Emilio, you'll give Vincent a hand from time to time. - It's not worth it. - Do as I say. You don't understand. It's to charge two workers twice. It's warped. - Warped? - He pockets without doing any work. Insurance, taxes and so on, they don't come for free. You just have to do your job and you don't need to worry. And when there's a football game on TV at 3 pm, the pubs are packed with people like yourselves. And anyway, everyone rips off everyone. It boosts business, it makes things grow. Progress, economy, the lot, that's life. In communist countries, people don't screw one another and nobody does shit anymore. - We don't screw anyone. - Sure. You'd lead the pack if you could. You either fuck someone over or you get fucked. That's life. Precisely, we can't screw other people. Nothing's stopping you from being a boss. But you need to be smart. And you're not smart enough. It's a simple as that. Remember that a boss is what guys like you really need. If from time to time I screw up a pig who lives in a villa, it doesn't do any harm. And I like you guys, so... Well then, it's perfect. Yes, it's perfect. - That's life. - That's life. Let's go. You're not coming with us? - No, I have the books to do. - The books, my arse! Workers are nothing but a bunch of lazy bastards! That's life. - Have you done that side? - What? - When do we stop? - Oh... - Would you like some tea? - Yes. Thank you very much, ma'am. - With milk or lemon? - Milk. A teardrop. I'll have it with lemon. One sugar. I'll have two sugar. I like it strong. - I prefer not too strong. - Can you agree on something? Bring everything together. We'll manage. That will be better. Miss? What is it? Wouldn't you like to go to Africa with me? You're going to Africa? - Yes, soon. - No, it's filled with snakes. - This one too? - Yes. Just one? Your back is the most beautiful in the world. You know nothing about it. And you will know. In any case, it's meaningless. Are you coming on to me? Not at all. It's simple aesthetical judgement. Effectively, objectively and statistically, there is somewhere a woman with the most beautiful back. But since I can't prove it, since my field of vision is limited to this here, I decide that it's yours, that's all. So, you're coming on to me and that you are a coward. A coward? - Why? - Because... You talk about my back only because you don't dare talk of something else, of what really is in your mind, obviously. She forgot the biscuits. She didn't mention any biscuits. Tea's always served with biscuits. Generally, it's shortbread. I would protest if I was you. Emilio, go ahead. I don't act stupid like you. Yesterday, I dreamed that I was old and still a gardener. An old gardener. With your horticulture degree you'd become a chief gardener. Get out of here. It's normal. What do you expect? Red-Cross street.. Third gear. Stop sign. First gear. Place du Bourg-de-Four. And who's there? Ghosts. Town Hall street. First gear. How stupid are you. Saint-Peter square. Second gear. First gear. Watch out, ma'am. Calvin street. And here is the Furrier. - Are you in Africa? - No, in India. An Hindu wedding. The couple meet for the first time on their wedding day. Imagine, it's a lottery. here too in a different way. At the end it's all the same. It takes five years living together to know if we're in love. - We'll finally know in three years. - Yes. But they have a more poetic way to stage danger. On your wedding day a veil's covering your wife's face. And then you remove the veil. Fantastic! For the rest of your life. What if she's ugly, missing teeth and scrofulous? You get 50 honey-moons, her teeth grow back and she heals. - It's that simple? - Yeah. Listen... I had to choose between 2 or 3 girls out of a possible 100,000 if we could use computer cards. Over there she's one unknown out of all the women in the world. Chance is science's pinnacle. And then, since love is somewhat obligatory, you have to commit to it, work hard for it, be careful, work some more. - And that's all you can think of! - Stop it. After 30 years together, it's fabulous. - And you have 12 children. - Who'll all starve to death. Ah, that's another issue. In the meantime, we can't decide on having a child because we are afraid. Are we afraid? You know very well. We've often talked about it. A little family, in a little apartment. Little Sundays out with the little car. And the little parents visiting. - Scary, isn't it? - Yeah. But saying we're afraid isn't enough. It's not enough. "Looting the Third-World" What are you reading? Where are we going to with this tree? To a villa. Marcel has the address. We should replant this tree in my yard. Why not? Yeah, why not? It's not hard. No, it's not hard. There's soil. It will grow well! - It will become a beautiful tree. - This tall! When the cops try to remove it everybody will climb the tree to prevent them from it. Kids, men and women. Why would they remove it? It's fine here. It's not bothering anyone. The Istanbul-London highway is meant to cross right here. Here, look. Istanbul is over there, London is here. You see, I'm exactly on the axis between the two. Understand once and for all that first, cinema isn't the one-for-all solution, a universal remedy, second, cinema cannot explain everything, third, cinema does not make the revolution, fourth, it's easy to forget it. - Therefore, we can live without it. - So, what is cinema good for? If you accept what I just told you and only in this condition, I will answer you that cinema is good for... first, remedying pain, second, explaining everything, third, starting a revolution and fourth, that living without it is impossible. What does it all mean? It means that each thing contains its contrary. Vincent, you didn't speak tonight. Why not? And the voice complains that for centuries Europe has force-fed us with lies and bloated with pestilence. And the voice complains that for centuries "Europe has force-fed us with lies and bloated with pestilence. "Listen dogfish that watches over the Occident. "Listen white dog of the north, black serpent of the south, "that cinches the sky girdle. "There still remains one sea to cross. "Oh, still one sea to cross. "That I may invent my lungs... "That the prince may hold his tongue, "That the queen may lay me, "Still one man to murder, "One madman to deliver." - A different one? - A new bottle. Come on, let's go. I can't leave now, there's a lot of people. - What do you want to do? - I'd like us to leave. Can't that wait an hour? Yes, that can wait an hour. Are you pondering? Fatigue. You and me, it could last like that always! Like Hindus. You in your gallery and me in my gardens. I'm trying to picture it but it gives me vertigo. # In tight rows, after the money! # - And you? - What? Doesn't it give you vertigo? Our situation isn't serious but it could possibly get worse. Slowly, slowly. Something is meant to happen. Not necessarily. Like missing candles. Let's make a baby. I'd like that. Right now? In the bathtub, that would be fun. In 50 years, he'll be 50. - What if he's a complete idiot? - It's a risk we have to take. If he fails at school he can always make films. Of course. I'm tired of your sarcasm. My sarcasm? You have the nerve. It belittles everything, every word wears away. You mimic my irony to avoid the real issues. What real issues? What I'm doing here for instance. But you, in your tub... I'm having a bath. You can go and save the world if you wish. Very clever. Neutral, first gear, stop. Moronic Square, Sub-suburbia. Bakery. Bobo-Dioulasso street. Tizi Ouzou Square. Old town. Sales, big discount, maximum car park one hour. Damn, no car park anywhere again. Damn it! Let's wait over there. Peace here. Will you make some soup? You said you would. - I didn't have time to shop. - Sure... I'm out at 7 pm, the shops close at 7 pm. Do your shopping earlier. You do nothing all day. - What do you know? - You told me. You type three letters, you welcome three nutcases interested in art... And that's on a busy day. Is that piece of meat going to move? Let's go away. For real. A spring is broken and it can't be fixed. This time I'm sure. Remember Max? - The guy in Algeria? - Yes. I'll write him a letter. I'll ask him if we can come over, if he can fix us something. It should be easy, he's been there for five years. If you go, I'll take the flat. They're pulling the house down. We're the last tenants. You write it. My handwriting is awful. Okay. So... - "My dear Max..." - Too formal, he's a friend. - "Old mate..." - It's horrible! "Mate, old chap..." Horrible. "My dear friend..." "My dear friend..." Pompous. You decide, then. "Dear..." well... "My dear Max" will do. My dear Max. My dear Max, my old Max, my old friend, dear Max! My dear Max, my dear Max, dear friend, dear Max! My old friend, my dear Max... - Max's answer. - Already? It's going to work out. Let me see. He says he'll be able to find us something. He asks that we give it a try for a few months before we decide to settle for longer. - To understand the country. - He's right. That's his condition for helping us. I think it's fair. Yes, all right. But we'll need some money before we can start work. We don't have any. No savings at all. It will take us a year to save 5000 francs. I don't want to wait a year. We can sell a few things. Like what? Well... everything. If we leave for good we'll get rid of it all. The car, the piano and everything else. We'll get enough money. You're right. Let's sell it all, including you so I can stay for... ten years without having to work. See, a piece of cake. You write a letter... Air mail, Geneva-Algiers. Three days later, Algiers-Geneva... A new letter, you open it and it's a brand new life. The simplest idea. You don't even see that in movies. Have you thought of how you'll sustain yourself there? We'll see. We'll adapt. Yes, you'll adapt. You adapt to everything. - Even to live like animals, like us. - See. You think you'll like it over there? I'm sure. I've thought about it for ten years. I know it won't be easy. No. You'll never be at home there. - I don't care about that. - Maybe but... Maybe you will. You'll remain a foreigner. But loads of people live abroad. Yes, people who never complain. Who aren't into politics. Those who just earn a living, well or not. For you it's different. You were forced to leave. True. But an exile remains an exile. He never wears the right shoes. Those who are loaded don't give a damn. They're foreigners at home too. But not the other ones. Now, take a look at the map. I bet you don't know geography. I learned it at school just as you did. Where is Tizi Ouzou? - Right here. - That was luck. Take a look at this book before we go. You haven't read this one. Or this one. I'll learn to sing in Arabic too if you want. Found anything else beside these books on politics? Like what? Stories that tell you how people live. In the cities, in the countryside. How women live. How much they earn, what they buy. - You know... - No idea. No, I haven't seen that. Nice music, isn't it? But don't dream too much. Why are you selling it? Because I'm going overseas. - Does it work well? - Fantastic. A real cannon ball. - You didn't damage it, did you? - No, no. I only made it a bit more nervous, just enough. Can you turn the engine on? There's a funny noise. Can you open the bonnet? Over there. Do you hear that? No. It's on. - It must be a valve. - Impossible. I would hear it a kilometre away. - I'm a mechanic. - Are you? - You don't have the looks. - Well, I am a mechanic. Besides, a car mechanic. So you're certain it's working fine. Every Saturday I'm head in the bonnet. It's my only passion. - I hope you believe me. - Yes, I do. But when it comes to cars you meet so many thieves and liars. Maybe the engine needed heating up, or it's my ears. So much do you want for it? 3800. It's a bargain. No, it's too much. It hasn't been looked after. Except for the engine, since you're a mechanic. - 3000. - Deal. - 3000? - Yes. Very well, it's mine. You see, international politics don't interest me anymore. It's about balance of power, like in Napoleon's time. It's rubbish. Internal politics, class struggle, that's where things really move on. - That's why we... - Politics again. You're a pain. It's the hymn they play before a football game. No, it's the Adagio of Purcell's Symphony no.11. Don't try to act smart with culture stuff. And anyway you know nothing about music. You it's cinema, him, it's football... that's fine. You're talking nonsense. Half an hour to go. A gift from the boss for your last day. Let's go. I'm shouting you a farewell drink. See, Marcel's not that dumb. He's not. You coming? - Do you mind going on your own? - Why? What's wrong? Nothing. I... I can't stand these streets anymore. They make me sick. - The chairs? - Yes. - The bunk too? - Yes. It's stained. We'll need the mattress for a few more days. You can have it when we're gone. Yes, but it's stained. Marseille in two days! Emilio and Marcel are in a garden somewhere. It feels like I left them six months ago. It makes me a bit sad thinking of them. Don't you think it all seems weird? Like if we'd already left a long time ago. I wonder how I managed to live here for 26 years. Antoine! A telegram. There's a problem. Max's asking that we don't leave tomorrow. What? Show me. "Don't leave tomorrow. Cannot have you home. "Obligation. Letter to follow. "Your friend. Max." What does that mean? This is crazy. We're already almost there. He has no idea. Shit! What does that mean? Let's wait for his letter. We'll see. The day before leaving. With a telegram... Like a film script but it's a very bad one. What shall we do? I'll call our friends to cancel tonight. No way. We're going, period. Tomorrow or the day after. That makes no difference. They should come over. I'm saying goodbye tonight. Why leave? That won't change anything. You'll take your problems with you. They'll always follow you, like a "D" on your shoes. What a "D" on your shoes? A dog. - I don't have any problems anyway. - He doesn't have problems! Look at his face, it's obvious, he doesn't have any problems. Happy. Ignorance is bliss. Then why drink so much tonight? You're at the bottle like a syphon. That's because I'm sad about leaving you. You'll see. Over there they imagine Switzerland has no thieves, jails or cops. - No way. - I guarantee you. I often heard that while I travelled. Even now and then a sublime glacier falls on someone's head, that's all. And since we can't put god in jail... Some even believe Switzerland is neutral. You'll have to tell them. Come on, make a effort. Give us at least one good reason for leaving. I don't want to die in toxic fat. Finally, he has one problem! One rich people's problem. Anyway there you'll always be rich. That will be a change. They'll all see you as a rich man. A white man. You're wealth will be a flaw you'll carry everywhere. Even when you are broke. Better than waging a revolution is a crystal ball. Yes, you act like a boy scout and give in to Third World's glory. You're just jealous. If Fran?oise wasn't there, I'd go with him Thank to Fran?oise that's one problem you won't have, a problem with your willy. Bye. - Bye. - There. Have a nice trip! Damn it. - Let's get some sleep. - I'm drunk but not tired at all. - What do you want to do? - I don't know. - Yes, he knows... - What it is? - Guess. - I don't know. Think about it. There's nothing left. Nothing, the void, nothing to do. Not tired. There's still a mattress, two people. One is a boy, the other's no boy at all. That's out the question. Never with a drunk guy. - One must be lucid for those things. - I am lucid. Or else being drunk would lose its purpose. What do we do? We wait for the morning to talk about it. Are you asleep? No. Me neither. We have the visas, the tickets... We're going anyway. No, we'll wait for Max's letter. We'll see more clearly. It's only a matter of days. Max isn't the Grand Mufti. We'll manage without him. We'll see about it tomorrow. Now I'm sleeping. Nothing left to eat. All gone. Putzel! Putzel, as they say in German. - We'll have breakfast at the cafe. - No way. Someone could see us. - There's no shame to still be here. - There is shame indeed. What's stopping us from going? You. Without you, I'd already be in Algiers. It's feminine and Helvetic zeal. All good reasons to be ashamed. In fact, it's true... Without you, I'd be leaving now. - Go, then. - What about love, uh? I'll meet you there later. No, we're going together. Today. My mind's made up. What Max has to tell us may be very serious. - You're chickening out. - It's got nothing to do with it. What then? You're chickening out! Going for a long time means you take some precaution. It's not just about moving district. - Chicken! - Damn it! - What? - "Chicken" is all you can say. So I'm answering in the same way. I've been trying to say stuff for 26 years. What if we're getting Max in some kind of trouble. I don't see why we would. I'm going to get us some food. No, I don't want you to be seen. We'll have to go out eventually. We'll go out at night. We'll go to a different district. We'll get home delivery. Are you sure there's nothing left? Some cheese? - What we kept for the mice. - No, all gone. There's a jar or jam in the luggage. - You're taking some jam? - A gift for Max. Some jam for Max? - My mother's jam's last jar. - Ah! Dear mother-in-law's English style marmalade? - Yes. - Bring it out, let's eat it up. - Go on. - Yes, my darling. I can't believe I'm still here today. Do you think the letter will get here today? Don't know. Maybe. He wrote "A letter follows". Flights from Algiers are on Tuesday, Thursdays, Saturday and Sundays, aren't they? Thank you, Miss. Today's Tuesday. If it's lands today we'll get it maybe tonight or tomorrow... What time is the mail? Usually around 10 am. And at about 5 pm. I hope Max has written "Air Mail" on it. If not it would get on a boat and then a train from Marseille. They'd lose it in Marseille, surely. That'd be the end of it. Okay, that's it, have a nice evening... Again, nothing. Nothing tonight. What a real pain. - I'd like to go out for a bit. - What for? We're fine here. We have everything we need. The books we're taking with us. The tape player. Tobacco and peace. The radio in the large suitcase. We'll some order food later. We can get it delivered. Warm food, ready to eat. Next time we'll ask them to bring some cutlery. Not for me. I'll use my fingers until Max's letter gets here. - I'll order some soup. - I'll drink it. Some tripe with gravy and some caramel cream. We're running out of cigarettes. I'll get us some. I'll disguise myself if you want. There's no-one here. Vincent and Fran?oise are gone. Far away. We're only here waiting for the next phase. There's always a little delay between an idea and an action. People can be incredibly persistent. I wonder who that was. It's annoying not to know. All of a sudden it stops. Damn it! - I'm going to buy some cigarettes. - Not in day light. - We have none left. - Too bad. You can go tonight. Downstairs, walking against the wall. We'll slowly become crazy if this goes on. We're gone. We're no longer here. If you're recognised in the street, they'll think you're a ghost. They may have a heart attack. Still nothing. What is Max doing? It's been four days! Maybe their post office's on strike. We haven't read the newspapers for a week. Or maybe the plane's been hijacked. Maybe the strike is here. Maybe outside everything is at a still. Maybe there's a riot. Organised by the police so the cops can practise. So the good people can find shelter in the arms of Order. Maybe, maybe. Go out discreetly. Buy the newspaper. Go downstairs. Get some cigarettes too. But be quick. I'll get the radio out of the suitcase. - Did you meet anyone? - No. - Are you sure no-one saw you? - No-one! Cinema... "Salut Berthe." 'Mother I Love You'... 'The Sexual Revolution' in 387 stations with aircon. 'The Libertine', 'The Whip and the Body'... 'Fantasia Among the Squares'. 'The Decameron', Part 2, the uncut version. 'The Sensual Male'. 'Two Sisters', a strange passion, over eighteen... 'The Swinging Confessors', 'Love Variations' - sexology of love. 'The Bull of the West', 'Dingo - The Olympic Champ'. 'Love Variations - variety in couple's intimacy'. 'Hang 'em High'. 'The Insatiable ' aka 'Femmine Insaziabili'. 'Erotic Holidays'. Ah... Erotic holidays... Slurp... Erotic holidays... Erotic holidays... The construction of Europe will not be possible without an autonomous European defence system, which would involve a nuclear umbrella, and more over, Germany's consent to common nuclear armament. Also, the power of nuclear decisions must be unified, and be supervised by one man only in case of a crisis. The consolidation of Europe won't occur till this issue, central to all other issues, is solved. Let's hope we reach this stage one day, but this won't occur over night because talks are being avoided. Today, the ratio of power... You're disgusting. But you order things impossible to eat on purpose. Use this fork. Come on. For the love of me! The letter's arrived. I can feel it. It's somewhere in a postal bag. They'll empty the bag, it will create a big pile. They'll sort the letters and we'll get it at 5 pm, I'm sure of it. The Post Office is fantastic. But what is he doing, god damn it? Have you seen the car park? What's happening? Nothing. All those guys who drive in circle to find a spot to park. I love it. It's planet Mars. Beautiful all day. It's a new invisible facial mask, which you can wear underneath your make up. Easy. Usually you put it on for 20 minutes, it dries , cracks and falls, whereas... The Swiss Guards Commandant quits the Vatican. Live in your own villa for the price of renting a flat. - It's raining. - It will help the leeks to grow. It smells nice in the countryside after the rain. I guess it doesn't rain much over there. It doesn't stop in winter. I'm really happy to be going. Right now we're not going very much. Today's Saturday. No mail tonight. No mail tomorrow Sunday either. Today I'm going out. - Because we're Sunday? - Because I need to move! I especially need to walk. I'm going to walk for two hours at least. - You shouldn't. - Why not? Because you'll meet someone. Then they'll all come here. We don't leave in a village and on Sunday they all sleep late. And what if I meet someone? I think we're being ridiculous staying and hiding in here. And I don't think so! I don't understand why you want this rotten city. I don't care about this rotten city. I want to walk, that's all. If you don't want to see the city, we can take a bus to the countryside. No way. It's making me sick. And on a Sunday to top it up! The poor darling. It's staying in here that's making me sick. You have no imagination. Stay with your books, I'm going out. In this inert town, this strange throng which does not pack, does not mix - clever at discovering the point of disengagement, of flight, of dodging. This throng which knows not how to throng, this throng, so perfectly alone under the sun, like a woman one thought completely occupied with her lyric cadence, who abruptly challenges a hypothetical rain and enjoins it not to fall... How was it outside? Very beautiful. - Depressing. - I told you. Depressing. Horrible. Strange too. What did you find strange? The impression that it no longer exists. To be a complete stranger. To have left. Are you called an alarmist? It's important to know that subversive movements are everywhere. Even amongst the legal authorities. The issue is to know whether or not we have adequate means to fight those movements. And whether the law in vigour allows us to react. Can you answer to that? The problem is, generally we can only intervene afterwards. We should be able to intervene before hand. The police is too small. The army should be equipped and trained to crush the protests. And in terms of steps to take, what can be done? Bills have to be drafted now so the law can be implemented when future troubles arise. The sooner the better. Nothing in the mail. We should have left eight days ago! It can't go on like this! What Max's doing? You should go send him a telegram. You're right. I'll go. By staying on this mattress all day we're going to turn into sex addicts. Someone's at the door. Don't move. If it were the postman for a telegram? They would leave a notice. Some registered mail. They'd put it under the door. - You were right. It's Max. - What do he say? He says his situation has suddenly changed. He has big problems at work and is about to quit. He's coming home. Maybe not for ever. He'll be here in eight or ten days. - Can he do something for us? - It doesn't look like it. Not yet anyway. Hang on... He asks that we wait for his return and he'll be able to help us. He'll give us the hints we need. - That's all. - Show me the letter. Ten days aren't so bad. It will be all right. Yes, of course. But we have to move in eight days. The gas, the electricity, the water will be cut off. They'll start demolishing. Bah, if we're still here we'll find a place to stay. What are you doing? Aren't you feeling well? I'm working out since you don't allow me to be a sex addict. At Scripture I was told that if we add sinful ideas, troubled thoughts, we had to work out right away. Hop! I'm going out. I'm going for a short walk. - Finally. - Just to get some fresh air. I'll go get a coffee. - Coming with me? - Yes but I'd like to read first. I struggled at first but now I feel good in here. Suspended in the void. It gives you time to think about all kinds of things. We have enough money to not work for quite a while. Yes, months and months if we don't buy 'things'. You're prickly. I'll shave. - Hi. - Hi. You must be mistaking. I don't know you. - Or maybe I don't remember you. - No, we haven't met before. It doesn't matter. I don't like eating all alone. - Do you mind? - Not at all. You're welcome. - Is what you're eating good? - Yes, it's okay. It's not bad. You were right the other day. It's horrible outside, It feels like a foreign city. A city... you haven't seen for ages, you used to know well but see with brand new eyes. Every step is somewhat familiar but it leads you nowhere and is motivated by totally different reason. A bit like in a dream. Hope, despair, love. It feels like... discovering things that familiarity had concealed from you. - What for instance? - I don't know... Things that move. The way things sound. The way traffic lights change. The pedestrian crossings. The painted line on the road which channel you not only physically but mentally too. Scary when you think of it. When you don't think of it. Back to back! After twelve days spend in the attic in the presence of words, the power of those words was fading. Those now pronounced were often unwanted. Those relating to the outside world were usually lies. Vincent and Fran?oise had made a decision that they still didn't know how to express in words. They knew without admitting it that they would not go away. What's the weather like? The weather doesn't matter much anymore. The weather, or the time that passes by. What else? It's raining. Unless the sun's shining. It's windy. The sky is blue behind some heavy black cloud. Or it's not windy. - I'll ride a bike. You? - No, I'd rather walk. The speed of a bike seems right to me. I'll hire a bike. Maybe on a bike everything turns beautiful. Oh, Vincent! - You didn't leave? - Not yet, we had to postpone. You're staying, but I'm going. Leaving? Going back to Spain with your bike and your suitcase? No, I'm dropping this at a friend's. I was passing by and we bump into each other. Better than in a film scenario. Where are you going? - I've been expelled. - From Paul's house? No, from Switzerland. - Thrown out? - Yes. They gave me two days. They're mad? What happened? I don't know. I was teaching French to some guys. One of them must have been a cop. We're only here to work and shut out. The bastards. Have you seen a lawyer? - No. - You have to do something. I'm off to France. I have friends there. No, wait. I'll try to find a lawyer but we must act fast. I'll do it right away. Ring me at home tonight. - Okay. - Do it. The lawyer can't do anything anymore. The police is saying Emilio's already gone. Nine months had gone past. In Emilio's courtyard the tree had grown. Very tall in such a short time. There's no clean shirt. - Did you hear? - Wear something else. A jumper. No, it's too itchy. You could have seen all my shirts were dirty. - Do you care about mine? - No. - It's different. - It's the same thing. If you don't want to wash them, bring them to the laundrette. you're not very nice this morning. I am nice, even charming this morning. Are you? Will you take the 6.30 bus tonight? No, I never manage to. I run as fast as I can and always miss it. Pick me up. Oh, it's a pain at that time of day. I have to come across town. Then I'll keep the car. No way, if I have to take the bus It will take an hour. If you don't pick me up I have to wait for half an hour. Okay, I'll pick you up. What bus do you take? I take the 7.05. In have to go. I have to go! I'm going. That's it, I'm gone. That's 80 centimes. Haven't you finished this book yet? I gave it to you months ago. I'm learning it by heart. Are you crazy? It's very hard. - Why learn it by heart? - Because it's poetry. At school we had to learn poetry by heart, I still do, can't help it. I'll try this one. I've been trying for three days. #At the end of the wee hours, the disparate stranding, #the exacerbated stench of corruption, #the monstrous sodomies of the host #and the sacrificing priest, #the impassable beak head frames of prejudice and stupidity, #the prostitutions, the hypocrisies, #the lubricities, the treasons, #the lies, the frauds, #the concussions... #the panting of a deficient cowardice, #the heave-holess enthusiasm of supernumerary sahibs, #the greeds, the hysterias, #the perversions, #the monstruous bulb of night, #sprouted from our villainies... - And our self-denials. - #..and our self-denials!# There. Ladies, I have an announcement to make. I'm pregnant. Well done. And why are you pregnant? Do you need a picture? Her husband's doings. But did you want it or did it happened by chance? A bit of both. Having children today, with what's in store for them... Polluted air, cancer, gas from the cars, bad water... WE should stop having kids. We'll go mad. We stop everything. No people, nothing. It all stops. - Lots of people still have them. - Yours will be funny. Little bosses. You may say what you want but this one's happening. He'll go to school to get brain-washed, then he'll work here. He'll go to school but he won't work at the post office. - What will he do? - We'll see, but not just anything. He will be... a pilot. Or a doctor. Or a boxer. - Knife sharpener, tiller. - Diver. No. He'll be what he will be, an idiot or smart. When he turns six I hope he'll see you as an old hag. He'll be right. Yes. You'll see yourself in a mirror and agree with him. Or you'll give him a slap. How do you handle yours? I tell him he's right. The good thing about kids is they keep you in the loop. All the time. If you're prepared to look. You see everything happening again. But differently. It changes, in a better way. It all gets better. If you want. Things are better for you than they were for your parents. Better for your kids than for yourself. Maybe. I'm generalising. If not for yours, for others they are. - Yours isn't yours anyway. - Who to, then? To everyone. As soon as he's born you have no right over him. You can give him a hand, that's all. Don't sacrifice yourself either. It's useless. He's far ahead. Not ahead, behind. He's ahead of you by 25 years. 25 years less, 25 years later. No. Ahead. Think about it. - Ahead. - Ahead. Way ahead. You can teach him stuff but you force him to think like you. Because you don't know how they'll think tomorrow, in 25 years time. Things don't stop. You kid belongs to tomorrow, not to you. If he call you an old hag that will prove you're wrong and you need to update. That's all. This is no talk for dumb asses about kids and old hags that we call parents, about how old hags have everything to learn from those kids who don't belong to them. We're going to become owners. - Of what? - Here, this apartment. It's written here. We sign, we become owners. As soon as the pen leaves the paper, when the last letter is drawn. - Then we can pay for 20 years. - What if we don't sign? We have six months to move out. Or we settled down for the rest of our lives. My flat, my square metres, my lovely wife, my car, my lovely holidays, my TV. - Enjoy life and pay later. - Shit. We look good enough to model for a fashion magazine. So young and already property owners. We wanted to leave this place anyway. Yep. I don't want it so badly anymore. Let's meet other tenants to find out what they think. Posties? My sisters? I'd like to send a wireless. To my mother, for her birthday. Here... Dear Mum, I'm sending you words. The rest is more complicated. Repeat after me to make sure. Now... To go away. My heart was pounding with emphatic generosities. To go away. My heart was pounding with emphatic generosities. To go way. I would arrive sleek and young in this land of mine and I would say to this land... To go way. I would arrive sleek and young in this land of mine and I would say to this land... "I have wandered for a long time "and I am coming back to the deserted hideousness of your sores." "I have wandered for a long time "and I am coming back to the deserted hideousness of your sores." I would go to this land of mine and I would say to it... I would go to this land of mine and I would say to it... "Embrace me without fear "and if all I can do is speak, it is for you I shall speak." "Embrace me without fear "and if all I can do is speak, it is for you I shall speak." At number 32 we can count on over 50 per cent of the people. - That's good. - Good. For the rest, I couldn't wait for everyone. Some refused categorically. Those who fear expulsion, those who don't want trouble. Those who accept to be manipulated. Two even defended the developers. The others with no opinion, we can warn them and tell them what's going to happen. - I can give out pamphlets. - We should share the chores. But we shouldn't drop them in letter boxes, we'll go door to door. You can do number 32 since you've seen half of them. I'll do number 34, you can do number 36. Okay? Okay. - Do you think we can win? - It's possible. So we're not leaving anymore. We'll leave when we've won. Let's call it a day. - Shall we go out? - To the cinema? There's nothing good on. Then let's stay in. You can either talk to me or court me. I'll court you. Let's surprise them with a child. Surprise who? Them, from the Cathedral. # Politicians and merchants... # Let's make them an enemy. A traitor to the nation. Kind and nasty. Naive and cunning. Kind and nasty. Tomorrow I'm not going to work. Neither am I. There's no need for an axe, is there? I don't think so. I'll try like this. Resisting. Yes. It's not working. Use the axe. How are we going to do with your son, my daughter, my son or your daughter, uh? What do you mean? How will we do? Even if it belongs to everyone, like Anne said, it will need someone to care for it. - We'll look after it, of course. - Who's 'we'? Us both. - I'll make him burp after drinking. - I'll do everything else. I'll give you a hand. - Should I stop work? - I don't know. At the beginning. Maybe for a year. Do you care for the post office that much? No, I won't stay very long, but I like the girls there. - Do you care for the nursery? - No but I don't have the choice. - Why not? - What? Hold on... You'd like it to be staying home? I think we can ask the question. - It's impossible. - Why? - I won't know what to do. - What about me? We'll have to learn. But... what if I have no maternal instinct? You can always try the paternal instinct. - And when he wants your breast? - He will, morning and evening. In between he can have a bottle. what about wee and poo? The laundry's in the basement. So... we're completely stuck. - Kids can't be left alone a minute. - I know. Can you imagine? The pram... At the park in the afternoon... with all those mothers. In fact, it's just as fair whether it's me or you staying home. - No particular benefit. - No. - So it could also be you. - Yes. - We're not making much progress. - None whatsoever. - We need a referee. - No, it's our business. - So let's do a random draw. - No. Why not? It's quite funny. I'd rather use reason. We've been talking about it for three days without any conclusion. I don't like chance. We won't get out of it otherwise. If you lose, you'll growl for an entire year. Not at all. I swear I won't. Okay, then. Here, a tiny coin. - Head or tail? - Not such a small coin. For the occasion, a bigger coin. Here. Here's a proper coin. Wonderful. Strong, heavy. Not to devalued yet but that will come. The head's William Tell. If he knew what he's be used for. He would never have done this with his wife. He would have strangled her instead. And he would have been acquitted. I'll do. The hand of innocence. - I'll do. I have the technics. - Precisely, you're going to cheat. Impossible. Look. The coin flips 50 times before landing. I can't cheat. Very well. Head or tail? You choose. William Tell or the coat of arms? Not the coat of arms. The guy. Of course. If the guy wins, you stay home. Okay? Okay. Let's do it. Now. Subtitled by Minx
