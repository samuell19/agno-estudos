I said, "Jo Jo, what in the fuck is wrong with you? Why can't you enjoy life?" And I found out I've always felt different. You know what I'm sayin'? I just never felt like I belonged, like I wasn't the same as everybody else. And everybody feels that way, right? Everybody feels... There's somethin' in us... We're different. What in the fuck is it, we can be alike, but we're different? I can remember back to when I was, like, three years old. I was in a crib... this is one of my first memories. I was in a crib, holding onto the rail. I was about three, right? I remember looking up, and my cousin came into the room. Ethel... she was beautiful. And I'm happy to see her. And she came walking over to me, and I'm there, waiting for some love and affection, and Ethel threw up on me. Well, when you're three, you say, "well, maybe... I don't know, but there's somethin' ain't right." You know, you go, "somethin' wrong. I don't think this is the way it's supposed to be." But you don't know. You're three. You say, "well, mommy never threw up on me. "Pop pissed on me once, but, look, this bitch done threw up on me." Right, and you're standing there, and you looking and... And she looked at me, and I said, "oh, she's going to wipe it off." And she threw up again. And I'm in throw-up from head to toe, trying to get some relationship going. And I didn't know how to say, "bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?" Talk to me. Hey, how you doin'? Jo Jo. I thought you quit, man. I did. I'm not doin' anything anymore, man. I straightened my act up, about time, huh? You ain't lyin'. What's happenin'? Uh, I'm, uh, havin' a party Saturday, and thought maybe you and sailor would like to come. Hey, sounds good to me. Yeah. Well, see ya. We be there. Dealin' motherfucker. Now I gotta have a party for the motherfucker. Shit. I always find 'em on the floor, the rocks. It's just, uh... right? There's a rock. That-that ain't no rock. That ain't nothin'. I am through. I'm tired of you fuckin' with me! I'm tired! I'm through! I'm through! I'm through! I'm through! God. Not gonna let it beat me.

They're doin' the best they can. Today at school, my teacher asked me what my parents did. I lied. I didn't know what to say. I felt invisible. You did good, Jo. I know who you are. I will be in for a lot of trouble when I grow up. - Am I always gonna be bad? - You're not bad, Jo, not at all. I'm not afraid, you know. I know. Well, why can't you change things? I can try. When? Hi, mama. My, my. Look at my boy. Look at you! - What are you doin' here, Jo Jo? - Just wanted to see ya. You know him? You were six months old when this picture was taken. You were such a good baby, Jo Jo... Your grandma's pride and joy. It was after you were born that she started to treat me nice. You were such a wild little boy... Smart, and always getting into trouble. Shit. Just a minute. Put this back up there for me, Jo. I wish I had something to give you, Jo Jo, but I gave you everything I have. Except I never did tell you how much I love you. Come here, baby. - Is the chart up to date? - Yes, I just did it. I gotta go now. And I've got to get back to work.

I know I'm pretty good, pop. I mean, I don't want to clean up hog guts the rest of my life. I worked hard, Jo Jo, to get you that job cleaning out hog guts. You ought to be glad you had that job, Jo Jo. I'm glad, but I'm not doin' nothin' against you. I just want... I don't think this is a good time for you... what are you talkin' about?

I want you to hear this. Yes? Your stepson wants to be in show business. - Well, if that's what he wants to do. - Yahoo! - You soundin' dumb as him, woman. - Ain't nobody dumb. You know, I've been talking with Fred Palmer down at the Kit Kat Klub. He said I got talent. All I have to do is get out of Morton. He said ain't nobody gonna discover me in Morton. He been down at the club over ten years, and he ain't shit. He ain't nothin' but some tired-ass white boy tellin' some tired-ass jokes. Pop, he knows a lot of stuff. He's been in it 25 years. I mean, he's been to Paris. He knows count Basie. - Named all the people he knew. - He wouldn't know shit oh, Charles, why don't you let him get out of Morton, Ohio? He's always liked it. You know he's always liked it. Ever since I've known him I've known it. And his mother... she could sing. And you know what? She always said he was gonna be somebody. Sonja, this boy ain't shit, and his mama wasn't shit. Why you always gotta talk about mom when you get mad at me? That's not right. I mean, she's not here to defend herself. Sure ain't. Ran away with that nigger from Detroit, left me with you. She's dead, Charles, god bless her. Pop, I'm tired of hearing that. Don't do that anymore. Don't stand up over me, boy, when I'm eatin'. I'm not. I'm just... Sit down, we're havin' supper. That's my mother. Sit down. This is still my house, boy. I tell you to sit down, sit down. - I'm not gonna sit down. I'm not a kid. - You wanna stand up to me? Pop, I'm not standing up to you. And defend that boy, I'll knock the cowboy shit outta you! Now, Charles, you're wrong! You shouldn't hit him like that. Don't tell me I'm wrong, woman. I want you outta my house. You get your show-business ass outta my house. Son of a bitch. I'll get outta your house. I'm leavin' tonight.

What do you mean, you can't go? My mama and my daddy... You go. It's what you want. I don't want this. Don't do this to me now. This is important to me. - Why'd you marry me, Jo Jo? - Why... what are you talking about? 'Cause you thought I was pregnant? I'm sorry I tricked you. I'm sorry I wasn't pregnant. I'm sorry I lied. That's all right. I just didn't want to be alone. Hey, I didn't want I married you so I wouldn't be alone, so we're not alone. Let's go. I can't go. I... You're not gonna go? No. No, baby. Okay. Cash this in, and they'll give you money for it. If it doesn't work out out there, will you come back here... home? I mean, I'll be here, waitin' for you. No, no. You don't understand.

I'm catching the train in the morning. You're catching a bus tonight. - What are you talkin' about? - Where you from? - Morton, Ohio. What, no Italians in Morton? I don't know about Italians. You don't get it, do you? Let me give you some advice for the future: Don't you ever pull a gun on men like that unless you're gonna shoot 'em. It wasn't a real gun. It was a blank pistol. They weren't gonna pay us. - But, look... I got the money. - Look, that's a part of show business. Sometimes you get paid. Sometimes you don't. It's a good thing detective Lawrence cares for you. I don't give two shits for him or his money. I did this for Doll. Now, you get your ass out of town, and don't you come back. - He's young, Tony! - And stupid. I'm not stupid! Nobody shot me. I got the money! Johnny, you know that five dollars you owe me? - Can we talk about that another time? - Johnny... Arturo, shut the fuck up. Everybody just shut up, please! Bus 19 for superior, Wisconsin... Now, listen, you let me know where you're gonna be, and I'll listen, I have something for you, okay? It's a book. It's just a book. But, um, I want you to read it. I think you'll like it. Don't forget what I told you, Jo Jo... timing. "Timing," you motherfucker. Come on, babe. I know you're gonna make it, Jo Jo. Okay? Stay funny. And remember... ti-ti-time... timing. And I don't owe you no five dollars. Shut the fuck up. How you doin'? Hey, got the paper? As of 2:27 this morning, Jo Jo Dancer developed complications in his respiratory system. We gave him hydrocortisone which cuts down inflammatory reaction in the body. He's in a critical state right now. His condition is guarded, and he's being monitored around the clock. In addition, Dr. Carlyle... Is daddy gonna be okay? Yes, baby. He's gonna be okay. He's in a very good hospital. They're gonna take very good care of him. But is he gonna die? No. No, he's not gonna die. Don't say things like that. I'm gonna take you to grandma's place, okay? But I wanna go with you to see daddy. No, you can't. Sorry, but you just can't. Reports indicating death are not true. As Dr. Weissman states, his present condition is critical. Hospital and police officials are only granting visitation rights to his immediate family. - Damn, baby. You read all these books? - Mm-hmm. Some of 'em up there... you just show these, right? I've read more than that. These books too? It's Malcolm X. You read Malcolm? Yep. Have you? Nope. No? No, no. You should. I mean, there's nothing wrong with being socially conscious. Hey, what's the name of your organization... "pussy now"? That was really crass. - You know, you're kind of a chauvinist. - What? What's a chauvinist? A chauvinist is somebody who thinks with their dick. You hear that? You got a brain. You like to think with your dick? All right. Okay. You read Malcolm X, okay? You think you know about him. I know Malcolm X. I know what he's talking about. So what? I mean, that's not all you are. It's not all I see. Anybody could be black. I could be black. You could be black? You're fuckin' crazy. You're snow white, okay? You're not Angela Davis. You're white. The Klan comes through that door now, and you're gonna holler, "rape!" Jesus. Bitch, you crazy. Shit. You're fuckin' crazy. I'm sorry. Sorry, my ass, bitch. Don't hit me no more. I'll kick your ass! - I'm sorry. I had no right to do that. - Fuckin'... shit in my hair. Please forgive me. I... I like you. I mean, it was nice. Sometimes, I don't know... I don't know, I, um... Don't ever hit me no more. I love you. I love you too. When we get married, you know, I'm gonna get you a big diamond ring. What? What's so funny? I'm serious. Don't be laughin' at me. I'm sorry. Nobody gets married anymore. I'm gonna get married. No, let's just live together, and... I'd be happy with just a cigar band. You know, like one of those Havana cigar bands, okay? My parents used to send me to the store for bread, then they'd move. I thought maybe they didn't like me. I went to New York. I worked in the village. I loved working down there because people used to come down all the time. They'd be looking for beatniks... I saw him on ed Sullivan's show... I watch ed Sullivan all the time, and he's not funny. Mother said he's gonna be very big. Then you should've taken your mother here. You're interrupting the show. - Who cares? What show? - Just keep it down to a low roar. Do the thing you did on ed Sullivan. - He wasn't on ed Sullivan. - Yes, I was on the ed Sullivan show. He only has talented, funny people, and you're not. I was like a test pattern. You moron. What does this mean in Italian? You can't talk to a lady like... Lady, I don't bother you when you're working Hollywood boulevard. You gotta act like a lady. We're having a good time. Let me buy you a drink, okay? You can't afford this, honey. If you don't like the show, why don't you leave? When I finish my drink, I will. Why don't you just get up on them drunk-ass legs and get the fuck out? If you can't get out on them legs, try them big-ass titties. You can bounce out on them. Well, they're real. Yeah, they're real. They're big as your mouth. That's it. Come on. How dare you. Can I touch 'em? You got a mouth like a toilet. Don't you wanna let a black man touch your titties? The only joke around here is that you're a comic. Fuck you. I'm out of the business. Do you know that? My agent come to my dressing room after the show, and he said... That manzio wouldn't let me work in that club in Chicago if I was gonna talk like that. - I told him to go fuck hisself. - Good. It's hard what you're doing, but it's good. I... I gotta...

You took a car from George? - Yes. How the fuck can you accept a car from George? We've been married eight months. - You told me you was through with him. - I told you I wanted a new car. You didn't do anything about it. You was gonna get a new car, but I'm tired of having to ask and beg you! You didn't have to beg me!

"What's the matter with you, boy?" - I said, what's the matter with you, boy? - Nothin'. Turn around and look at me when I talk to you. What happened to you? Why is your nose bleeding? The boys at the railroad track... they jumped me. What boys? Johnny, Joe and his brother. - What did they jump on you for? - They said my mother's a ho and lived in a whorehouse, so I hit 'em. Oh, they got some nerve. Their mama is a whore and doing a whole lot worse too. They said they gonna beat my ass on the way to school tomorrow. You a dancer, and don't nobody be beating on a dancer's ass. If they hit you, you hit 'em back, only harder. Understand? Yes, mama. You are gonna get up early tomorrow morning, get down to the railroad track, find yourself one of them big sticks... And a good hiding place. And when they come by, you jump out and commence to whalin' on their ass, and they will not jump on you no more. You can take grandmama's word for that. I'm gonna get 'em real good, mama. Don't nobody beat on no dancers. You got to look out for yourself, 'cause grandmama ain't always gonna be here to see about you. Come over here to me. - You'll live forever, mommy. - Oh, sweetheart.

They're saying you're not gonna make it. I don't know, Jo. It's up to you if you want to live or die. I can't help you, little Jo, if you don't ask. Ain't much time left, Jo. Ain't much time left. He... help... me. Help me. Help me. I thought you'd never ask. Thank you, god. Good evening. I'm happy you're here tonight. I'm glad you came. I'm happy to be alive. 'Cause I fucked up. I fucked up bad, me and my dumb ass. Thank you. Thank you. Please sit down. Sit your ass down. Thank you. Thank you very much. We are gathered here today... To say farewell... To a man who lived a full life... Jo Jo Dancer. We say good-bye to Jo Jo... Who tore his ass... On the freeway of life. He imbibed of alcohol... And drugs. The boy was a mess. He ran through life like shit run through a goose. And now he rests here... With a smile on his face. I guess that's a smile, and I hope that's his face. You sure that ain't his ass? Well, it looked like his ass. This is his face. Okay. And Jo Jo, though he lived life to the fullest, he did not hesitate to help others. Oh, no. You see, he embalmed hisself. Yes, he did. He embalmed hisself with alcohol. Yes, he was 470 proof when we put him in here, what's left of him. And he preserved himself with cocaine. If you dug out his nose now, everybody in this room would get high. And we have telegrams from people that loved him. And I will read one now. It's from his ex-wife. Yes, she did. "You black motherfucker. "At last you're at the place I wished you to be. "May the maggots eat out your ass and dance on your eyelids. Sincerely, Shirley." As you can tell, she is distraught. She was a little upset with him. Most people in life lead with their chins... Because that's the way life is. It demands that you lead with your chin. But not Jo Jo. He led with his nuts. If his nuts was not in a vice, he wasn't happy. You had to crank him up, and Jo Jo was happy. We have other telegrams, over a thousand from friends of his... People he owed money to... Wishing him well in hell, wishing him a good time in hell. Well, Jo Jo Dancer fucked up. Not only did he die, but he died with their money in his pocket. There ain't nothin' worse than a man dead and he got your money. Makes you wanna dig him up and kill him again. Amen. Amen.
