Across the face of our globe, prevailing winds blow almost constantly. These are the trade winds, and in the age of sailing ships, they pushed many a precious cargo over the seas. And yet no treasure ship could hold the priceless cargo the winds themselves carry. For these air currents bring clouds to the land areas and life-giving rainfall. Sometimes, however, the winds meet with a natural barrier. Along the western edge of North America, the Sierra Nevada and cascade mountains rise like an enormous granite wall and keep the rain-bearing clouds from reaching a large portion of the continent. The highest point in the United States is found in this range -- mount Whitney, towering nearly 15,000 feet above sea level. Here in the shadow of this majestic peak, the wasteland begins. This is death valley, bitterest of all deserts and the lowest point on the American continent. Once this valley lay beneath the sea. And as the ancient waves receded, they left an ocean's skeleton, deposits of salt that still stretch for miles. But this desolate basin is only the beginning of the great American desert. From the vicinity of death valley, it reaches to the plains of Texas, and from a corner of Oregon, deep into old Mexico. For the granite blockade of the sierras has created one of largest deserts in the world. The eternal desert -- incredibly ugly yet fantastically beautiful, seemingly without purpose, without meaning, without life. In part, it's a place of silence -- monument valley. In part, it's the painted desert, where petrified trees become their own tombstones. In part, this is a region of naked hills, a sea of burning sand. It's a country where rivers give up their hopeless struggle and sink into the earth. This is the land of the mirage, where seeing isn't believing. Those mountains are real enough, but the water that reflects them is only an optical illusion. And here's another phantom lake. Now you see it... Now you don't. The desert holds many mysteries, but none more puzzling than the riddle of the rocks that move. These strange trails, gouged in the floor of a dry lake, are made by boulders weighing nearly a ton. But whether the rocks are pushed by the wind, carried by floodwaters, or impelled by some unknown force, nobody knows, for no one has ever seen the rocks in motion, only the marks of their passing. Part of the desert's endless panorama is the salton sea, itself the remainder of an ancient ocean. And here are scenes that come from the time of creation. Along these shores, pent-up gases bubble and boil like seething cauldrons. Nature's symphony of the mud pots. This, then, is the great American desert, a land of heat and sun, of sand and soundless space, the ominous silence broken only by the howling of the sandstorm. How anything can live in this harsh region remains a mystery to most of US. And yet where we find only a dead and desolate wasteland, nature finds life. And this "true-life adventure" is the story of nature's living desert. It's the ancient drama of the struggle for existence. And for the most part, life here is a bit on the grim side. But of course there's always comedy relief. This character, for instance, is an odd bird for sure. He's the roadrunner, so-called because he'd rather walk than fly. A nosy fellow completely lacking in manners, he has a habit of pecking at anything lying around loose, such as the tail of a garter snake. A confirmed practical joker, he finds this great sport, making little snakes out of big ones. At the residence of Mrs. Tarantula, it's always open house. She's forever cleaning her parlor for guests that might drop by for dinner. Uh, her dinner, of course. And here comes a caller now. This lethal lady is one of the leading actors in our drama. She'll be receiving more visitors from time to time. A gourmet who prefers a different diet is the chuckawalla. These little fellows are strict vegetarians, diminutive dinosaurs who dine on daisies. To meet the harsh challenge of the desert, nature must fashion odd patterns of life. And with the spiny cacti, her creations approach the realm of fantasy. Trees being scarce, the desert birds must build their nests in the most unlikely places. Still they manage to turn the drawback to an advantage. Home, sweet home here is a bristling fortress, guarded by 1,000 bayonets. To each bird, its own brand of cactus. For these young thrashers, the cholla provides a nursery as neat as a pin cushion. The prickly pear becomes sanctuary for the dove, while the desert skyscraper, the giant saguaro, is a haven for the woodpeckers. Here too the red-tailed hawk chooses her nesting place. On the living desert, nature delights in the unexpected. Sometimes in the very heart of the wasteland, an underground stream will reappear. But these watering places are rare, indeed. Most of the desert creatures must learn to do without water over long periods. The tortoise is lucky. He manufactures his own, using the special equipment nature has given him. He gathers his raw material early in the season when there's still green foliage available. By internal chemistry, he converts the leaves into clear liquid, which he stores beneath his shell. He's a traveling canteen, able to tide himself over long periods of drought. Another piece of special equipment that makes life a little easier is the skid under the tortoise's chin. It helps him over the rough places. A tortoise must gather his Greens while they're available. Yet this poses a problem. For now it's courting season, too. A nice dilemma -- stay a bachelor at the waterworks, or chase after the women and maybe die of thirst. A coy glance from the sideline soon settles that question. The bashful male begins his courtship as a nodding acquaintance. Then when he gets a bit bolder, the lady as usual gives him the runaround. After all, every female wants a choice in the matter. At the proper moment, in the proper tradition, the rival enters. With a sort of ponderous chivalry, the two males square off. Two knights in armor ready to battle for the lady fair. Uh, but first they agree on the tournament rules. The handy skid now becomes the jouster's Lance with which he tries to upend his rival. In fact, this is the object of the bout since a tortoise turned upside-down is completely helpless. Finally, it's tortoise turned turtle. Eight, nine, ten, you're out. He's not only lost his dignity, he may lose his life. Vulnerable to heat prostration, he must right himself immediately or die of sunstroke. The winner meanwhile claims the lady fair, totally unconcerned with the plight of his opponent. An immigrant from Central America is the coatimundi, a tropical cousin of the American raccoon. Thanks to a cast-iron digestive system, he's right at home here. He'll eat anything. Insects, lizards, fruit, eggs. You name it, the coati will eat it. What's more, nature made him almost completely immune to the deadly sting of the scorpion. And so he often adds this spicy tidbit to his daily diet. For dessert, what could be nicer than the fruit of the prickly The coatis are by choice tree-dwellers and often make their homes in hollow logs found along the dry washes. As soon as mother coati makes the bed, the youngsters come along and muss it up again. Playful, fun-loving, these little rascals aren't as innocent as they look for coatis are born bandits, even to the masks on their faces. Since egg-stealing is their favorite pastime, they're a constant threat to unguarded nests. Working like professionals, the second-story men make off with the loot. And Mrs. Vulture arrives just a little too late to save her eggs. About this time, mother looks in to check the swag and is quick to cut herself in. Meanwhile, this junior burglar finds he forgot to steal the combination. And then after the omelet, a quiet nap. These wild pigs are called by several names -- jabalinas, peccaries -- but their real name is trouble, for they're one of the most ferocious animals on the American continent. They travel in groups, especially when accompanied by young. Unlike their domestic cousins, peccaries wear a thick coat of fur. And when they find a patch of damp sand, they welcome the chance to cool off. But now another vicious fighter with an equally bad reputation comes their way. It's a good rule on the desert to keep clear of a bobcat on the prowl, but it's an even better rule never to pick on a peccary. Like all wild pigs, they have long tusks and short tempers. The cat's instinctive reaction is to climb a tree, but no tree. Well, it's no time to be choosy. This is an emergency. When it comes to a choice between sharp tusks and sharp thorns, the cat prefers the latter. Not the most comfortable spot in the world, but at least he's safe. And the bobcat finally decides the desert's no place for a tenderfoot. In her desert drama, nature knows neither hero nor villain. She's impartial and plans for the survival of all. Thus the rattlesnake is given a super-sensitive tongue with which he tracks his prey. Even the faintest scent left in the sand will guide him unerringly along the trail. The pocket mouse has only one defense -- he goes underground, and it's any hole in an emergency. Oop! Any hole but that one. Hot on the scent, the rattlesnake sticks to the trail. Wherever it leads, he follows. Uh-oh. The tarantula and the rattler -- two of a kind. The snake isn't to be bluffed out of a meal. He's sure the mouse is in that hole. The spider is sure he isn't... While the party in question would rather dig than debate. Largest of all spiders and armed with her own brand of poison, the tarantula stands her ground. And oddly enough, the rattlesnake backs down first. It's a standoff, and nobody wins... Nobody, that is, except the little mouse who wasn't there. The scent cold, the trail is lost. And this time a desert killer has been outwitted by everybody. Every afternoon along about sundown, the red-tailed hawk flies to this particular spot and waits... For here occurs a phenomenon that's as regular as clockwork. Inside this cave, millions of bats are awakening, for their day begins with the twilight. Bats are the only flying mammals. This species lives exclusively on insects and so helps nature keep the pest population under control. Now as evening approaches, these night fliers take off for their hunting grounds. To navigate in the dark, bats use a form of radar. Their high-pitched squeaks bounce off solid objects to become the echoes by which they guide themselves. Soon the sky is filled with clouds of bats. And this is what the hawk has been waiting for. She draws a bead on half a dozen or so, and down she goes! A clean miss. Oh, well, maybe she forgot to allow for the wind. This time she checks elevation, drift, diving angle, and... Scored a hit. But it gets away. Old butterclaws. Was ever a bird so frustrated? This can drive a hawk to nervous prostration. She just can't figure it out. You see, nobody ever told her about the bats' radar. Frantic now, she'll try anything, even a collision course. To her surprise, it works. And a mighty small reward for such a prodigious effort. To nature, the loss of one bat, or even 1,000, is really no loss at all. This winged column streams into the sky until long after the sun has gone from the scene. The nighttime wonders of nature's living desert more than match the wonders of the day. The desert water hole in particular attracts an odd assortment of night life. Here the toads find a hunting ground especially to their liking. Here the centipede puts his best foot forward and steps out for an evening stroll. Suddenly he finds he's wandered down a dead-end street. In the realm of fancy footwork, however, the millipede is without equal. Millipede -- literally "1,000 feet," give or take a few. Count 'em. Uh-oh. Looks like a bad night for a pedestrian. But not this one. Nature gives the millipede an unpleasant odor guaranteed to make him completely spider-proof. This pungent defense, however, has its limitations. The toad finds it quite appetizing. Whenever the moon casts a spell over the living desert, the goblins appear. In this case, it's an elfin owl. From her doorway, she watches a strange ballet in the moonlight. Like a creature bewitched, the burrowing snake performs his serpentine solo. The owl is witness to many unusual scenes, but one of the strangest is the courtship of the tarantulas. The male comes calling like any love-sick Romeo and knocks on the female's door. In her own good time, Juliet appears. He greets her with open arms -- all eight of them -- and draws her close. The lady takes her cue and swoons. A bit theatrical perhaps, but it's a technique that always works, even with tarantulas. But the owl hasn't seen anything yet, for now begins the courting dance of the scorpion. Of course, the first thing he needs is a partner, so he digs one up. Being native westerners, the scorpions favor the lively rhythms of the square dance. All right, everybody! Choose your partners for the sting-o-ree. * lady and gent to the center of the ring * * lock those claws, lift that sting * * three legs up and four legs down * * whirl that scorpion round and round * * circle 'round, and away we go * * sashay right with a do-si-do * * halfway 'round and backtrack back * * snap your claws with a clickety-clack * * gents to the left, ladies to the right * * now, ain't that gal a pretty sight? * * swing your partner, give her a hug * * get your hooks on a lady bug * * stingers up for the sting-o-ree * * but watch out, gal, you don't sting me * * allemande left with your insect fair * * and take your gal to you-know-where * The amorous mood of the evening seems to be catching, for now the long-horned beetle in formal attire decides to drop in on the lady downstairs. What a charming smile she has. And such magnificent mandibles. He's the forceful type and walks in unannounced. But his welcome isn't quite what he expected. First thing he knows, the lady clamps a hammerlock on one of his feelers. And then she begins to gnaw on his leg, merely her way of hinting that she's already going steady. And by the coincidence which is usual in romantic farces, here comes the boyfriend now. A double headlock, and then a deadlock. But in the end, true love triumphs, and a battered beetle beats a hasty retreat. After what he's been through, this lad's in no mood for nonsense, not even from tarantulas. Nature's on his side this time, for she's armed him with some special anti-tarantula weapons. And when they finally part company, the spider's left with a new respect for beetles. Just how long can this charmed existence last? If at first you don't succeed, call your big brother. "Hey, mugsy, take care of this wise guy, will ya?" Big toad bites little beetle. Little beetle bites big toad... On the tongue. Ouch! During these moonlight hours, most of the nocturnal creatures spend their time gathering food. The kangaroo rats in particular carry on a busy harvest. Supplies are stuffed into their large cheek pouches for future consumption. When pouches are filled to capacity, some of the gleanings must be buried. Finding a likely spot for a private pantry requires some scouting around. In the process, some mighty odd things turn up... Such as a belligerent horned toad. It never fails. Whenever you want a little privacy, there's always somebody looking over your shoulder. The nosy neighbor. He minds everybody's business but his own. The nuisance is hard to discourage, but he finally takes the hint. And once he's out of the way, the food's put into storage. These little fellows have some rather unusual habits. They practically never drink water, but, like the tortoise, manufacture it inside their bodies. And for a bath, what could be better than good, clean sand? In this bustling colony, there's never an idle moment, and Mrs. Rat's busiest of all, for mother's work is never done. She's nurse, housekeeper, and provider. A mother with babies to feed is constantly on the move. And she must often travel considerable distances to find seeds. With all her responsibilities, Mrs. Rat is extremely cautious and quick to hide at the slightest sound. The kingsnake isn't poisonous, but he does have an appetite for kangaroo rats. Mrs. Rat needs no second warning. She heads for home and her children. Now the snake picks up her trail. In this crisis, mother rat has a plan, but she must work fast. For emergencies, every family of kangaroo rats prepares an auxiliary burrow. On her second trip, she barely manages to slip in the back door, as the enemy enters the front. But the nursery's empty. Where's the missing baby? Lost in the maze of tunnels, trying to find his mother. Still on the trail, the snake heads for the second burrow. And then an innocent bystander saves the day. Enter the gekko, a poor, defenseless lizard. Well, not quite. For nature gave him a detachable tail. And so nothing's hurt but his pride. He'll soon grow another tail and be as good as new. This odd pattern in the sand is made by the sidewinder, or horned rattlesnake. There's a reason for this strange method of travel. It gives the sidewinder traction in soft sand where other snakes won't go. Thus nature provides him with hunting grounds all his own. A formidable hunter, he leans strongly toward a diet of lizards and rodents. Small but extremely poisonous, he doesn't usually track his prey, but waits for it to come to him. Yikes! In the face of such a potent enemy, most intended victims take to the hills. But not the rat. He takes the offensive. And his favorite weapon is a homemade sandstorm. Against this stinging barrage, the rattler has practically no protection. His eyes especially are vulnerable. They have no lids, only a delicate covering over the pupils. He can't even squint. The snake's ambush has failed. Only one thing left -- start sidewinding for the nearest exit. Now that the enemy's in full retreat, everybody wants to claim a share in the victory. Naturally, after such a tremendous triumph, a celebration's in order. Then in typical human fashion, the affair degenerates into a brawl. The commotion attracts an outsider who decides to crash the party. This popeyed prowler is the ring-tailed cat. Actually, he's no more cat than his cousin the raccoon, but he does have a cat's taste for kangaroo rats. And here's another big appetite on the lookout for refreshments. The squabbling rats are about to learn one of nature's oldest laws -- a single moment off-guard can be your last. It's a lucky rat who gets away to live perhaps another day. In nature's design for the desert, the pattern changes with the passing hours. Each species in turn -- insect and bird, reptile and mammal -- has its preferred time of day. Now in the cool of the morning, the ground squirrels appear. These are the roundtails whose favorite breakfast is the prickly-pear cactus. Its juicy pulp provides them with both food and drink. They're also fond of leaves and seedpods. Breakfast often lasts all morning, unless there's an interruption. It's old nosy Parker, the roadrunner. Incidentally, he's a member of the cuckoo family, a charter member as far as the squirrels are concerned. Still they know how to handle this clown. Just give him a taste of his own medicine. But no sooner are they rid of one nuisance, then another appears. This time it's sweet William, the spotted skunk. He's a night prowler and, like all skunks, carries a grudge against everybody, especially when he's on his way home to bed. And whenever he's around, somebody smells trouble. When Willy gets his back up, it means, "stand aside, buster, or I'll let you have it." There's not much a squirrel can do about this. Wow! When he's had it, he's had it. What's this? Another intruder? Ah, it's only skinny, the kid from across the way, always trying to horn in. "Hey, how's chances for joining the gang?" But the gang, it seems, wants no part of skinny. Still, skinny's not easily squelched. "Games" This guy's getting a little tiresome. Besides, he's interfering with breakfast. They decide to put him in his place. But skinny doesn't mind. At least he's the center of attention. And who knows? Maybe this is the initiation. Well, if that was the initiation, somebody forgot to give him the password. Suddenly, skinny and his problems are forgotten, for now a visitor approaches who can't be ignored. The gila monster -- a strange combination of ugliness and beauty. He looks like a beaded bag, but this is pure deception, for nature, in a moment of grim humor, filled the bag with poison. In their panic, some literally grasp at straws. Something must be done about this ugly customer, but who's to do it? The only to take action is skinny. Well, he wanted to play tag, except this time, it's apt to be tag for keeps. Still, skinny has two things in his favor -- he's fast on his feet, and he has a fighting heart. His method of dealing with gila monsters is to insult them. As he warms to his work, he even gets a little cocky. "Hey, skinny, get out of there." Once he starts something, though, skinny sticks to it until even the gila monster can't take any more. And who's the hero of the hour? Why, skinny, of course. Let's give the little fellow a big hand. It's been a busy morning for the squirrels, but whenever things calm down a bit, it's back to breakfast. "Hey, who's rocking the rock?" Well, it's the tortoise. "Morning, brother tortoise. You leaving?" "Okay, everybody, free ride's over." And so the gang gets off, all except skinny. He's one of those characters who just has to ride to the end of the line. On the living desert, nature's theme is always the preservation of the species. And she uses many methods to accomplish her purpose. This is the pepsis wasp, or tarantula hawk. In order that her kind may survive, she must stalk the deadly tarantula and engage it in mortal combat. It's her perilous mission to sting the giant spider, paralyze it, and thus preserve it as food for her young. She hurries from one likely looking hole to another, literally asking for trouble. And she finds it, but not the kind she expected. The ant army swarms to the attack. Their one purpose is to weigh her down, keep her earthbound. Against this organized onslaught, the wasp has no defense. She can only hope to shake them off. She wins her freedom, but only to resume her search for spiders. Driven by the compelling urge to reproduce her species, she'll let nothing stop her. A tarantula it must be, and a tarantula it is. Now they are met, face-to-face. And this is a sight few have ever witnessed. In this strange encounter, the spider battles for its life, the wasp, for generations yet to come, for only through the tarantula can she ensure the propagation of her line. In this raw and elemental struggle, these are the weapons -- the paralyzing sting of the wasp and the lethal bite of the spider, the rapier and the broadsword. In size and brute strength, the odds favor the giant, but these are more than matched by the frenzied skill of its tiny adversary. The stricken wasp grovels in the sand, but the spider fails to follow up. It's a missed opportunity and a fatal mistake. In this brief respite, the wasp recovers. And now she drives for the one vulnerable spot, the abdomen. Then the turning point as the wasp suddenly reverses her tactics and, flat on her back, thrusts home. She scores again and again, and her poison begins to take its toll. The groggy giant is almost defenseless now, but the wasp is a creature obsessed. Finally, one last paralyzing thrust, and the battle is over. But now, in victory, the wasp faces an even bigger task. She must drag the spider, many times her size, to a secret hiding place. But into her fragile body, nature has packed a strength prodigious beyond belief. With fanatical energy, she digs a hole, for it's part of her ritual to Bury her victim. Now and then, she pauses to check for measurements... Then returns to her task. A tremendous Boulder presents an obstacle, but only temporarily. To a human, this would be like towing a 10-ton truck with your teeth. Now on the tarantula's body, she will lay a single egg. Soon a new wasp will emerge, feed on the paralyzed spider, and then one day venture forth to replay this grim desert drama. Still at large in the vicinity, the rattlesnake is on the prowl again. So far, this killer seems to have had his own way, but there are a few creatures who dare to challenge him. And one of these is the red-tailed hawk. And so this time, even as the rattler stalks his prey, sudden death hangs over his own head. Flashing talons strike for the head, but the snake is like a steel spring. When the spring is coiled, it's deadly. The hawk finds an opening, seizes the rattler's head, and as suddenly as it began, the violent conflict has ended. But if death and destruction stalk the living desert, birth and rejuvenation inevitably follow after. New life, however, depends on rainfall. And so nature brews up a tempest and drives her thunderheads over the mountain barrier. In this land of extremes, there are no half measures. It's either no rain at all or all at once, and so the cloudburst. Almost as suddenly as they came, the torrential rains disappear. And yet more violent than the storm itself is the aftermath, for now miles away where the desert lies silent, untouched by the cloudburst, an ominous rumbling is heard. It seems to come from all the canyons at once. Suddenly from out of nowhere... ...a wall of water on the rampage, the flash flood of the desert. On these barren hills, the rushing waters find nothing to hold them back. And so from all sides, they converge, become a torrent, a raging river, and finally a desert niagara. In all these endless miles of space, the lost river has nowhere to go. Soon it dissipates its strength. Its currents span out on the flats. Water mixes with earth until only a river of liquid mud remains. And finally the once raging torrent is swallowed up in the desert's overwhelming vastness. It would seem that nature has brought water only to waste it, for now the scorching sun dries out the last bit of moisture. Yet this is only the surface. Moisture seeping through the desert floor has awakened dormant seeds. The miracle of the flowers -- one of nature's greatest triumphs. In this floral galaxy, the desert wild flowers display their blossoms in almost endless variety. Poppies... Lupine... The primrose. And in even the tiniest plants, the surge of new life is strong. Throughout the desert, the drab cactus plants reveal their hidden beauty. In daylight and darkness, the pageant continues. Now the night-blooming cereus passes through its full cycle in a single night... From bursting bud to full-blown flower. Here is one of nature's innermost secrets, the heart of a living flower. The flower fades and withers away. And yet in this fantastic wonderland, there are no endings, only beginnings. After every ebb, the full tide. After every night, a new day. And so it will be through all of time. This, then, is the desert's story, a story of the life-force itself, challenging and mysterious. The eternal story of the living desert.
