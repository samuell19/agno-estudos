(screaming) I'm not sure… I totally get it. What's to get? It's time to reflect. Let us then raise a glass and reflect upon… this fine, expensive repast on the last 15 years and everything we've done to make the world a better place. Is that an example of sarcasm? Not entirely. It is an expensive meal. I'm volunteering again. Everything you do jeopardizes me. Jeopardizes us. Is there paperwork involved? You have to register or something? I'm not an idiot. I'm stuffing envelopes and licking stamps. It could be anyone. Fine, then. Good. Why don't you join, um… a knitting circle? Why don't you join a book club? Why don't you join an asshole club? I thought we were supposed to be celebrating. Not celebrating- commemorating. Commemorating. Let's get back to the toast, then. I don't know what to toast. We never killed anyone. And we haven't killed each other. Let's drink to not killing, then. Oh, whoa. Ah, aren't you cute? Horrifying. How much do you think it's worth? Ah… it's anatomically correct. These dolls with male genitalia are pretty rare. I think we can get a couple hundred. Wow. Good eye. Well, it's, uh… weirdest shit we've had in the last 15 years, eh? I'm gonna go to bed. See you tomorrow. (alarms wailing) (children shouting) (police sirens wailing) (car horns honking) (police sirens wailing) (voices in background) (voice over police radio) Yeah, Rod. I'm looking for Rod. Wh… where's Rod? What do you need Rod for? I'm, uh… looking for some green beans. Rod's out of business. You'll have to buy your vegetables somewhere else. Baby stuff- skip it. Probably wanted an arm and leg for this crap, but we should check it out anyway. Here's one for you - records and stuff. You take these… and I'll hit the rest. Rod was busted. How do you know? I phoned him, someone else answered. Sounded like a cop. Don't use that phone again. No kidding. How much dope do we have left? (sighing) How much for this? That's my liquor cabinet. A lot of good memories in that piece of furniture. What's a memory worth? You can have it for 40. - Twenty. - Thirty. Sold. Here's half. You take that and I'll… I'll come back for it. Cool. (children playing in background) - Do you want those naked women? - What? Those playing cards, are you gonna buy them? Yeah, I think I will. Doesn't that make you feel strange? What, it's not like I'm looking at pictures of my mom. Do you think that's what your mom looked like naked? (sighing) Don't want you to think I'm a pervert. I don't. Thanks. Uh… 50 cents. Cool. Dan! Get the baby carriage. (baby whining) (baby crying) If they push that button If they push that button If they push that button If they push that button You can kiss your ass You can kiss your ass Goodbye goodbye Goodbye goodbye Goodbye You can kiss your ass Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye They're talking about They're talking about Nuclear war Nuclear war Four-twenty. Garbage will be hitting the street soon. What's that smell? Did you get pot? Just a… pinner I made from some roaches. There's that bike again. They're piling beer bottles in its basket now. Well, it's only been there a couple weeks. That's long enough. What do you want? I'm not gonna jack it in the middle of the day. Well, get it at night, then! (sighing) (sighing heavily) (car horns honking) Hey. Hi. What's up with the garbage picking? People throw stuff out, I sell it. So you're a parasite feeding off the carrion of consumer culture. Exactly. Tax-free! Fuck the system, fuck the Man. - I fuck the Man. - You fuck the Man? I sell trees. Why should I pay taxes, have more roads paved for fucking cars? Help America fight their oil war. Political. Cute. I'm not cute. Trees-what does that mean? Is that young-person code for something? Why don't you come with me and find out? - Uh… - Too busy garbage picking? Try this. It's B.C. organic. Really? (inhaling deeply) Mm. Yes, it is. People need good dope to get through modern life. It's true. Scavenging through garbage can get pretty monotonous at times. I suppose looking at naked women helps break the monotony. I could've made good money off those naked women. Objects carry meaning. What's trash for one person is income for me and something more sacred for whoever cherishes it. We all have keepsakes. I'm not talking about sentimentality, I'm talking about history. The collective consciousness. Take you and those nudie playing cards from the '50s. They are beautiful girls, you're a beautiful girl. Perhaps you identify with them. Perhaps. For whatever reason, I could see that these cards were an object of far more importance to you than to me. To me, it was just about making money. I'd have a very different argument if you were rich. But, uh, by the looks of your bike, I would say you're not. I sell dope. Can you hook me up right now? No. I don't carry the shit on me. Once I got fined, and another time, I lost half an ounce. So what do we do? Do I call you? No. You give me your number and I call you. I don't have a phone. - No phone. - I use payphones. Hard as fuck. Take this sample. Ahem. Hundred bucks a quarter. Exclusive. How do I get more? Parkdale is my 'hood. I'm sure you can find me. Ah! (bottles rattling) Fuck. Where have you been? - Oh, uh… - Argh! Fuck it. We gotta move. Ah, fuck! - It's gone! - What? A beautiful wooden desk with, like, fine lines. I think it was a Heywood Wakefield. We could've gotten $500 for it. Okay, okay! I found someone… (whispering): …who can get us weed. (music playing) It's from B.C. Memories. Who'd you get it from? Someone on the street. Jesus. How do you know they're not heat? She's, uh, in her early twenties. She's not that kind of heat. (chuckling) Nice bike. Do you, uh, wanna go for a coffee? Let's go. (teaspoon tinkling) I wanna be one of your handpicked clients. Okay… Here's the deal. I go back to my place and pick up a quarter-ounce. It's what you want, right? Whatever 80 bucks will get me. That's 100, fucker. Oh, capitalists ride bicycles now. On the contrary, I insist on sharing a joint with all my… clients. Okay, well, let's meet in the park. No, I'm not gonna smoke a joint when I'm carrying a quarter-ounce of B.C. organic. Laws are stiffer for this shit. So… what do we do? Uh, go back to your place? We can't do that. My, uh, roommate doesn't want strangers to come to the house. Who's a stranger? We shared a joint. I don't think my roommate would see it that way. Well… those are the rules. Do you want the weed? One of us is gonna have to trust the other one. I want the weed. Well, then… you've got a lot of old stuff. Yeah, my roommate's got the eye. You gonna sell this thing? Yeah, I'm still working on it, but we should be able to get 100 bucks for it when I'm finished. Enough to cover the "trees." (woman chuckling softly) There's something to this garbage picking. Scavenging. Yeah, well, we've been doing it for a while. So what's this stuff for? Well, uh, it might look like easy money, but believe me, it is not. And sometimes in winter I have to get a job. Day labour, you know? Only good thing is our rent hasn't gone up since we've been here. We're kind of a low priority for our landlord. You better not touch that. I wouldn't want my roommate to know anybody was here. Sorry. Yeah, well, I gotta be very careful. Linda's very particular about her things. Her room, for instance, I'm not allowed to enter. So, uh, where do you wanna smoke this joint? Uh, well, let's go to my room. Ah, it's so great you can come in and help us, Linda. I really need help raising money for the organization. So how's it going? Ah, it's going. Yeah, I know it's kind of a drag stuffing envelopes. But you kind of have to reach deeper for your motivation. I used to sit at home and watch TV and I'd flip past those charity ads for suffering children- "For the price of a latte a day, you can save a life and adopt a foster kid." So I gave up lattes. Little Juanita from Ecuador died anyway. Do you have any children, Linda? No. Well, they're a great inspiration. I had one to replace Juanita. The room. Make yourself at home. Aren't you a little old to be playing with toys? Uh… I collect them. I'm fascinated by the ones that reinforce society's… Judeo-Christian military-industrial values. These are the toys that indoctrinated a generation of children. Traffic and commerce are normalized. The aggression of our culture is made benign and acceptable. Technology will solve all our problems. A supreme being blesses our actions. And you weren't indoctrinated? Sure I was. I had to free my mind. How? Weed. Books, music. This hippie shit you're playing? Okay, this is not hippie shit. Jeez, I thought… all girls liked Leonard Cohen. Who are these… cats? This here is the MC5. The official band of the White Panthers. Who were the White Panthers? Group of white kids that modelled themselves after the Black Panthers. - Who were the Black Panthers? Uh, okay. Bobby Seale, Huey Newton… Yeah. You don't know the Black Panthers. Okay, the Black Panthers were a radical, political group from the '60s. Black. Put it on. I'd love to drop the needle on this one for you, but unfortunately, it is a mint original pressing. It's too valuable and I don't have a play copy. How about this? Is this too precious for you? It is precious, but maybe for you, I'll make an exception. Thank you. What's with the chicks and the guns? Early '70s… radical chic. Trying to be urban guerillas, I guess. - Urban guerillas? - Once upon a time, there were groups of kids with guns and bombs who wanted to overturn the government, scare the shit out of them. The vice-president of the United States tried to have this album banned. Well, then, we should definitely listen to it. (music playing) Can you dig it? It's good. They're building bombs While our schools are fallin' Tell me what in the hell we're paying taxes for Well why don't we all Stop paying taxes - Mmm… Now why don't we all stop paying taxes There's a hidden history within these grooves and I've managed to salvage a small corner of that history from the garbage. What are these? More hidden history? Um… they were hidden until you pulled them down. These are just more stuff I collect-first editions. Who's she? Bernadine Dohrn, the first female urban guerilla to make the FBI top-10 list. Crazy eyes. Julie Bellmas, Canada's own, helped bomb a factory outside of Toronto that was making parts for nuclear weapons. She looks so young. She is… your age. Ulrike Meinhof- German revolutionary, mother of two. Cool shades. So who are these guys? This is the Baader-Meinhof gang. Actually, they called themselves the Red Army Faction, but Baader-Meinhof had more brand-name recognition. German revolutionaries from the '70s, the authorities called them terrorists. Started that whole trend for terrorism. I'm sure you've heard of it- it's very big now. So can I borrow this? Uh… you wanna, uh… take it away? - Uh… - I could just read it here. All right, you can take it. But please be careful. I will be careful. There's something on my mind Yeah So I wouldn't mind meeting again in a couple weeks- 4:20 at the Beatnik? I'll bring another quarter. All right. I'm glad we met. Yeah… me, too. Oh, no, they're not worth as much if you break up the set. I don't care about that. It's my signature. Hmm… What No Who I don't know Yeah Why do guys like girls like that That's what she asked me (bike bell ringing) I don't know Why do guys like girls like that I shrugged my shoulders You know (bell ringing) Why do girls like guys like that She said I don't know Yeah maybe it's chemistry Oh yeah Yeah maybe psychology Oh no Yeah maybe it's a magazine Oh yeah Yeah you know Some kind of preprogrammed fantasy They look so young They act so numb They look so bad They think they're rad What are they on Where are they from That's what I want to know Where are they coming from (bike bell ringing) They look so dumb This is Jason. Oh. Isn't he a cute little white boy. (sighing) I know, he's white and he's privileged. Jason won a lottery. He should be covered in tumours like the kids of San Carlos. Are you married, Linda? Uh, no… not according to the state. You have a partner. Um… "partner" is a good way to describe him. You're living with a man? Uh, well… …"existing" might be… a better term. Wanna have a kid with him? No. I had an abortion once. That was close. I'm really sorry. It must've been so hard. No. It wasn't. Dan! Oh, whoa. Ugh! - My pedal. - What? I banged it on some asshole's SUV when he sideswiped me. I was feeling the Meinhof. Uh-huh. Crank arm's cracked. You're gonna have to get a new one. (sighing) Well, come on. Come on. I think I can help you. (banging and rattling) (groaning) So what goes on down here? Well, we get bikes once in a while and I tinker with them, fix them up. You'd be amazed at the prices these rich assholes are prepared to pay. You know, they get a whim and they say, "I need a retro-hip bike," and their personal assistant's too busy kissing ass to drive around and find one, so he emails a friend, the friend emails a friend, six emails later, they got me. You just found all this stuff? I, uh, found, bought… You can get most of this stuff for pretty cheap. Most people don't have use for a busted frame. I do. Think you got my part? I think this one… this one will do. It's not exactly perfectly matched star-wise. Do you care? Nope. As long as it runs. I could, uh… fix this bike up a bit. No, I like it beat up. It's… less likely to get stolen that way. So did you see your, uh… your girl today? My girl? Yeah, your girl. How'd she get a hold of B.C. organic? She's not my girl. I don't have a girl. What is her name? Susan. What is this Susan like? She's like anyone her age. She's young and energetic and curious. All the things we're not. So how was Rivers of Resistance? Oh, it doesn't feel like much of a resistance. It's an organization that exists to alleviate one woman's middle-class guilt, and I don't mean me. - What's this woman like? - She's fine. She's a new mom. She likes to talk about kids. - Kids? - Yeah. Kids. Young people. Like Susan. So how does she get a hold of this pot? Guess what? She's from Calgary. Really? Yeah, she split there a couple years ago to go to the coast. Don't worry, I played dumb about Vancouver. She tried the hippie Commercial Drive thing at first, but couldn't get into that flaky West Coast vibe, or the rain, so she hooked up with some pot-growers, bought a pound of dope, drove it out to Toronto and now she's the T.O. contact for the growers. They hire someone to drive the shit out to her and she sells it. Genius. So… what does she know about us? What do you mean? Well, you seem to know a lot about her. Well, she's someone who likes to talk about herself. Where do you guys meet? - Beatnik. - Beatnik. They wouldn't let you buy dope there. Well, we don't do it out in the open. Where do you go, then? We go down to the basement. (Linda sighing) What I do in the basement is my business. Well, she knows where we live. Well, I haven't let her upstairs. Well, I'm sure that's just a matter of time. So you won't be upset when the inevitable happens. Saturday afternoon What a day for a riot I'll meet you out on the street You know you really should try it Do I seem out of my mind That's what the teachers all said It's 1970 now Flower power is dead Flower power is dead Saturday afternoon Saturday afternoon Saturday afternoon Saturday afternoon Saturday afternoon Saturday afternoon Saturday afternoon This meeting is important. What I do is important. I'm talking about my job here, not your hobby. Huh! You can't just dump Jason off here. Ah, hello. Are you gonna save the world, too? Huh? I can't take care of Jason while I'm playing basketball. Don't play basketball, then. This is not about basketball! Like I said a million times, this is about a promotion! Okay, fine. I'll take him, but you owe me. (Jason crying) Give me the keys to the minivan. No, I need it. - What? - How am I supposed-- You dump Jason off here, you can't take the minivan. How am I supposed to get to the gym? (Jason screeching) That's the rule. Whoever takes Jason gets the minivan. Screw the rules! If I get this promotion, I can afford to buy another car. I don't want another car! That's not my point. Then what the hell is your point? Stop yelling. - You're yelling! - This is yelling! Sorry I'm late. My bike got wrecked. Why? What happened? Ah, nothing. I was just riding recklessly. I banged it up. Recklessly. Be careful. We can do something about that. Let's go. Okay. You like this bike? You can't… you can't steal someone's bike. It'll encourage people to start driving. You can't steal this bike. Easy, Miss Righteous. This bike has been abandoned. It's been here for weeks. I've been watching. People are using it as a garbage can. You see? Yeah, I see that. People who don't care about their bikes don't lock them properly. Stand back. The Bicycle Liberation Organization, BLO. Is this a BLO job? How's that? I think it's a little high. Your feet should just be touching the ground. Here. Try that. Oh yeah, that feels good. Feels good? Uh-huh. BLO action… complete! How can I ever thank you, comrade? What the fuck? Uh… this is Susan. This is… Linda. My roommate. Hey. You look… familiar. I think I've see you around. Do you make a lot of deliveries in this area? None. I don't wanna be known as the neighbourhood dope dealer. I have customers all over the city. Why did you approach Dan? Was it because he was wearing his fancy blue jacket? What brings you home early today, Linda? Let's just say that I hate kids. I brought your books back. Oh, yeah. Yeah, the books. What the hell? These books were in pristine condition. I read them. What good is hidden history if you're not gonna learn about it? They're not worth half as much when they're damaged. Your hidden history is for capitalist gain? I thought these books were about fighting the system. When you fight the system, you can't exactly count on the system to take care of you when you're older. These are my retirement plan. Be careful with history. Sorry. You make me feel like a chastised child. Do you feel like an overbearing father, Dan? Bike sure looks familiar. She needed a bike. Next year she's gonna need braces. Do we pay for that too? (trunk motor starting) Whoa. Second Fugs album. This has "Kill for Peace" on it. I bet Susan would love to hear this. How often did she come over? Oh, don't worry. She just comes over when you're out being a volunteer. Well, you're gonna have to figure out some other way of getting her alone, then. What, you're quitting? Ah, I can't stand that place anymore. Well, just because a woman brings her baby in, that's no reason to quit. You believe in the cause, you know, you gotta put up with some minor inconveniences at the workplace. Now you're supportive? When you wanna fuck some chick? I don't wanna fuck Susan. Oh, sure, it's just talk. Yes, it is, as a matter of fact. What do you guys talk about? A lot of things. Like groups. Like, uh, The Fugs. Country Joe and… the Fish. Stiff Little Fingers- And groups like the Red Army Faction, the Vancouver Five? She has a healthy curiosity. Mm-hmm. I just hope she's not planning on dropping by all the time. (bicycle bell ringing) Whoa-oh. - Whoa, hey. - Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi. I, uh… I got a new shipment in and I just… I felt bad about what happened the other day with the books- Hey, hey, guilt is a construct of the ruling class to suppress the masses. Pay no attention to it. You, uh, wanna drop by, listen to this album? It's, uh, from the '60s. It's political. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Uh, if that's okay with you, Linda. Sure. Kill Kill Kill for peace Kill kill kill for peace Forty years later, they're still killing, and we ain't got peace. It's, uh… not the mono original, unfortunately. I'm sure I don't care. So what's the deal with this new batch? Oh, you know how the growers are always futzing with the strains. It's, uh, it's all-natural, though. It hasn't been genetically modified. Could I see? Dan said you had the eye. I can make something look worth buying to a rich asshole. Ahem. It's not much of a talent. Can I see more? There might be, uh… something on the memory card. I don't like to keep a record of stuff we sell. You don't archive your work? This isn't art, it's commerce. I dunno - these are pretty impressive. It could be art. I prefer to recycle art, not make more of it. What do you mean? I collect postcards and photos and stuff. Can I… see them? Sure. They're upstairs. (music in the distance) People just throw this stuff away by the truckload. I'm convinced the vintage-photo market will be huge. Why keep these ones? Something about the people, their hair, their style, private jokes they're sharing, intrigues me. These people have become so familiar, they… they comfort me. So are any of these real photos? They're all real. No, I mean, like, are any of them your real family? Maybe. (music playing) You ask about my philosophy baby Yeah So if all of these pictures are real, then how come… there aren't any pictures of Dan? Why would I have a picture of Dan? Do most people have… pictures of their roommate? I just thought maybe you guys were… closer than roommates. No, no, we're… we're just roommates. Anyway, how close can two people really be? Should we sit here and have a good cry about it? If we were hippies, maybe. Kill the hippies! Smash the patriarchy. Off the pigs. First we'll kill the pigs and then we'll eat dinner in the same room with them. Everything okay up there?! We're talking! Talking?! Yeah! Talk! (sounds of traffic) (birds chirping) (bicycle bell ringing) (car horn honking) (brakes screeching) (crash) Fucking idiot! That really is a nasty-looking gash, Susan. Ah, it's nothing. You should see the car. Here's this, uh… bike I've had my eye on. Great. Linda? Here, try it. Give a man a fish, he eats for a day; Give a man a rod, he eats for life. (Susan chuckling) Is that from the Bible? It's about men and their rods, isn't it? (small dog barking) Oh, the chain's broken. Go, go, go. (dog barking) Get on. We'll roll you home. (dog barking) (all laughing) What? - Up here! - Ah!! (honking) (laughter) (honking) (honking insistently) (honking loudly) Whoo! (laughter) That last bike was pretty nice. We could've… we could've gotten something for it. How'd it get wrecked? I'm a little aggressive, you know. I have to learn how to be more defensive. Yeah, I don't think so. What really happened? You really wanna know? What are we waiting for? Wouldn't it be great if there were revolutionary groups today? Yeah. I hope they make buttons that I can collect. Have you always been such a cynic? Ever since I stopped believing in Santa Claus, God… And what do you believe in? Nothing. I'm an agnostic morally, politically, financially and sexually. Just looking for a little peace. (bicycle bell ringing) (bicycle bell ringing) (other bicycle bell ringing) What's going on? (several bicycle bells ringing) You'll see. (multiple bicycle bells ringing) (punk-rock music playing) Whoo-hoo!!! Paint it good. Art as a real threat. (camera shutter clicking) (police siren wailing) What the fuck! (Susan panting) You coming in? Who were those guys? I don't know. They had masks on. Oh, come on. Ahem. We call it the Spoke Club because we ride bikes. It's a cell structure. I learned about it in one of those books you lent me. And you're the ringleader. There are no hierarchies, Dan. You're a big part of this, too. Why? Because I gave you some books when I was flirting with you? Is that all it is? (music) Ah ah ah Pow pow Right on Pow All right all right Ow I want no part of this. I need your help. My help for what? We damage a lot of bikes. That's our signature. You know where the abandoned bikes are. You know how to fix the ones we ride. I'll trade you weed… in exchange for your help. Although you really should do it for the cause. What cause? We're gonna drop a Molotov cocktail on an SUV in the middle of a busy intersection. Do you even know how to make a Molotov cocktail? No. I was hoping you'd lend me a book on it. (indistinct background conversation) No, like… Look, there, there's the other one. The little boy. - Oh, that's cute. - Ah, yeah. - Aren't those things tacky? - Yeah, they're adorable. Five bucks? Each? Uh, for both? Sold. What about this stuff here? I'm not gonna sell that. I need that. - Oh, it's not part of the set. - What about that? That's nice. Jesus, four grand. I told you. Oh, good… Good eye. We could go on vacation, like normal people. Well, we can't get on a plane or rent a car. We could get on a bus. They take cash. - And take that bus where? - Fuck, I don't know. I can go by myself, leave you alone with Susan. Well, I'm not sure I wanna be left alone with her. What? I'm a little worried about Susan. Why? Well, she started her own urban-guerilla group. They call themselves the Spoke Club. They swarm SUVs with their bicycles. Swarm? They wreck them. They… trash the shit out of them. I saw it happen. You're kidding, right? You shouldn't have given her those books. They're books. I didn't think it would lead to this. This is just asking for trouble. Well, should we stop buying from her? No. This dope is too good. We have way too much at risk here. We need to sit her down and have a talk. (sighing) Uh… let's… sit down and talk. What's wrong? I just… wanna talk to you alone. Um… Linda and I… aren't exactly roommates. We've been together for a long time. - Uh-huh. - Um… I don't know what we are exactly, but I do have feelings for her that have lain dormant inside me for a long time. And, uh, you have… awakened those feelings from a deep slumber. What are you trying to say, dork? Well, what I'm trying to say is very delicate. Ahem. Just say it. I… feel affection for you, um… …but I don't wanna act on it, because I still have feelings for Linda. Why are you being so serious? Because you kissed me and, uh… we… made out, uh, kind of, in the basement. I kissed you because I wanted you to join the cause. Dan and I need to talk to you about something, Susan. Dan already talked. What's your problem? Dan told me that you'd been involved with… wrecking SUVs? Dan can't keep a secret. Do you wanna talk about this, Susan? No, I'd rather wreck more SUVs. We can't be involved in any criminal activities. Revolutionary activities. There's a difference between a criminal and a revolutionary. Not to the Man, there isn't. That's why I don't think we can see you if these activities continue. Is this a goddamn intervention? No. But I am concerned. The world is going to shits and you think that I'm acting out some sort of psychoanalytic compulsion. How does wrecking SUVs help the world? That's the difference between your generation and my generation. My generation. What are you talking about? Your generation wants to help the world, my generation thinks the world is fucked. When I was your age, I thought the end was nigh. It didn't come. It doesn't mean that it won't. (bell ringing) Uh… what the hell's that? - It's the doorbell. - Nobody uses the door. Somebody's at the goddamn door. - Linda, get the door. - No, you get the door. - Linda, get the door! - No, I'm talking to Susan. Stop talking to her and get the door. (knocking) Get the goddamn door. Get up and get the door. - No, you get the goddamn door. - I'll get the door. (both): No, no, no! Ted? Ted, what are you doing here? Hi, Dan. I would've called, but I lost your number. I need to let this guy in to take a look at the place. If that's okay. Just a minute. Uh… You wanna come in? Yeah, we need to come in, take a look at the place. Okay. - Thank you. - Thanks, Dan. Kitchen's back here. You mind if I show this guy the rooms? Ah, it's really messy in here. Are you…? I don't care about that. I just wanna see the rooms. Hello, girls. Is this radical chic? Long live Che, baby. I don't… I don't get it. Ted, you haven't by here in years. You kept the place in nice shape. I appreciate that. Why are you doing this to us? Look, Dan… the last thing I wanna get involved with is paperwork bank bullshit… …but I'm getting old. (sighing) What did he say? He wants to sell the house. When? I dunno. He doesn't have a buyer yet. Fuck. Why is he selling?! The neighbourhood is taking off. What are we gonna do? You'll have to live in tents, like the Palestinians. You shut up, Susan. This is real life going on here. I'll tell you about real life. Do you have idea how much rent is this city? You gonna have a garage sale? What would I find, picking through your garbage, Dan? Beatnik Cafe, same time, same place. I'll bring a quarter. Jesus. Fuck! (sighing) (industrial noise) (industrial noise) (jackhammers pounding) (dog barking) (industrial noise) Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! So what are you guys gonna do with your place? What can we do? The whole neighbourhood's becoming gentrified. We remain powerless before the onslaught of the free market. Wish there was something we could do about the housing crisis in this fucking neighbourhood. - Well, maybe there is. - What? We could firebomb a house. If some of the houses in this neighbourhood got firebombed, then people would be less eager to buy, the area would be less attractive, house prices would drop, rent would be cheaper, you guys wouldn't have to move. That's crazy, Susan. An abandoned house- no one would have to get hurt. Are you guys ready to make the leap from theory into action? (police siren wailing) (industrial noise) (noise of jet engine) What, are you afraid to firebomb a house? This has nothing to do with fear. No, it has to do with will. I don't care to have a philosophical discussion with you right now. Why not? Talk is easier than action, isn't it? I'm sure there's a mid-ground between talk and firebombing. Yes. You could teach me how to make a Molotov cocktail. What makes you think I know how? What's been going on between you two? Nothing! Oh, fuck, I can figure it out for myself. What am I gonna do anyways? They're gonna firebomb a house so that you guys can keep your comfortable lifestyle? This is a comfortable lifestyle? You seem to have everything! You think we've enjoyed picking through garbage for 10 years? We live like we're in the Third World! The Thi…? Fuck, don't tell me that you identify as one of the oppressed! We're certainly not living the life of the oppressors! That is just exactly an excuse for apathy! We're not apathetic. You ride bikes and read books about revolution! How is that taking action?! Wake up, you fucking posers! What the fuck do you know about us? You think you know what we've done?! You know nothing! You know nothing! Maybe you should keep your mouth shut about things you don't know. You think we woke up one day and decided to pick garbage to save the world?! We never used our heads?! You think we never did shit?! We never read these books?! We're in those fucking books!! Glad you've figured out that the world is bad! You're not the first! We were doing actions when you were sucking your thumb on your daddy's knee! Being a revolutionary means more than destroying things! Blowing up shit, that's frat-boy stuff! That's entertainment! Do you even know what you're working towards?! When we did actions, we were focused, organized, we issued communiques and put it in context, which it is meaningless without! You wanna off some pigs?! - Blowing up SUVs, that's tough? - You and your fucking beret! You think that's hardcore?! We broke into a car dealership and set the whole thing on fire, 23 vehicles with a can of gasoline and three ignition units, and that was a front-page story in every fucking paper in the country! I set a man on fire! Yes, we did. I did it! That's what I fucking did! Third-degree burns on 80% of his body! I may have disfigured him for life! Tell her! It was a… protest against the Gulf War and… and we didn't know that a security guard was there, so... he must've heard us and came out to take a look. It was my fault. (sighing heavily) I should've… I should've thrown it when he was inside. (sighing heavily) But I got scared… and panicked. Linda took the bottle from my hand and that was the end. It was in Vancouver. That's where we're from. It happened 15 years ago. (sighing) (door closing) I'll fuck fire And I'll fuck rain You can have my child And get done or down But the A-bombs are coming Oh oh the A-bombs are coming I'm worried about Susan. She's an arrogant child. I'm worried she's gonna tell someone. If she's serious about her politics, she's not gonna rat on us. She's not an informant. What are we gonna do? If we have to take a lover, sleep together… that's what we'll do. Let's get some sleep. (police sirens in distance) (police radio) You're the kid's parents? - Ahem. Uh, n-no. - We're family. She's my stupid, rebellious niece. Sign in here. Okay, just be aware that I will be in the room while you talk to her. Okay. Should've taught me how to make a Molotov cocktail. I fought In the old revolution On the side of the ghost And the king Of course I was very young And I thought that we were winning I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing As they carry the bodies away Into this furnace I ask you now to venture You whom I cannot betray Lately you've started to stutter As though you had nothing to say To all of my architects Let me be traitor Now let me say I myself gave the order To sleep and to search and to destroy Into this furnace I ask you now to venture You whom I cannot betray Yes you who are broken by power You who are absent all day You who are kings For the sake of your children's story The hand of your beggar Is burdened down with money The hand of your lover is clay Into this furnace I ask you now to venture You whom I cannot betray DVD Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
