Fred is due any time now. I have got to talk to you before he gets here. What is it, Dennis? We're in a jam. We have to decide what we're going to do. Sit down and tell me what's happened. - Jane, we've been found out. Your husband hired a detective. When I got to my office my secretary said he'd been there. The detective. He had a picture of you. He must have got it from your husband. Fred? He wanted to know about you coming there. How often. What time of day. Everything. That made me think of other places we've been. I called them. I called them all. The same photo, the same questions. He'd even got them to sign affidavits. Well. I suppose it had to come out sometime. I never dreamed it would end like this. It's not very pleasant, darling. It's not the way we planned. But in the end it will be. I feel as though I've been holding my breath for six weeks and .. Now I can breathe again. Jane. - It's good. It is so good to feel free and open about this. I have hated it. I've hated having to keep it under cover until we could both be free. But now it's out. And we can be open with them and make a clean break. Now we'll leave behind everything that's spoiled our lives. We'll start a new life together. We haven't done anything to be ashamed of. All we have to admit is the truth. The way they'll put it .. They take the affidavits, the witnesses. Seen here. Seen there. They add it up their way. They make it come out so .. Sordid. We can explain. Try to explain when they twist the words right in your mouth. They .. [ Door knocks ] Fred? Fred, is that you? [ Dog barking ] Go on. Go on. Go on. A stray dog. He doesn't belong here. I thought .. You've caught me in my work clothes. Alright. So I am just a house frau. Close your eyes and imagine I am very beautiful. Jane, listen to me. When I got this news it knocked me off balance. I've been trying to think straight all day long. Trying to come to the right decision about what I must do. You should have called me. This is our problem. I know that. The thing that hits me hardest is what this will do to my two daughters. And Jane, it comes down to this. My daughters come first. They're teenage girls, Jane. They're right at that age where my companionship is important to them. Their pride in me. What I stand for. My reputation. But. But only last week you spoke of .. How they had grown away from you. That they had their own interests. They and their mother. I said a lot of things. I don't know if it was that I wasn't seeing the situation clearly or .. Don't you see what a scandal like this will do to those kids? With my face, my name. Their names smeared across the front pages? This is more important than .. What we felt for each other. But I was worried about this. And you said no. You had a right to your own happiness. You paid their bills and beyond that had no moral obligation. Things I said look shabby now. I know. Oh no. If I could only .. Make you understand. Make you .. See it clearly. What is it, Dennis? What is it you want me to do? Persuade your husband not to make a scandal out of this. You can do that, Jane. I know you can. I'll try to help you. Surely he can be made to realise that .. Revenge won't do him any good. The whole thing can be done so quietly. And then we can go away together. No, Jane. All of that is over. What then? I go back to Katherine if she'll take me back. And you .. What do I do? Then you will be free. That's what you wanted. You wanted to be free of Fred. I wanted to be free so I could be with you. That can't be. But our love? Everything we have grown to be. I just can't stop loving you. Jane. No. I would rather be dead. Face this thing. Please. Try to understand it realistically. This isn't reality. This is a nightmare. I'd adjusted myself to this drab existence. Poker parties and business dinners. Of living with a man who never wanted a child. Who expected everything and gave nothing. You've made me see this for what it is. You made me fall in love with you. Have you nothing to say? All my life. I have been wrong. So wrong. So many mistakes. You have me guilty of .. The most shameful, disgusting thing a woman can do. No. No. I'd rather kill myself right here and now. Than believe a love that I knew was good and fine is .. Is this! Jane. Don't talk like that. I would. Jane, stop that. - No. Jane. Dennis. Things like this don't happen. You read about them in the newspapers. They just don't happen to ordinary people like me. I've killed him. I have murdered. I have. Stabbed. I have stabbed. I have stabbed. Dennis. Hello? Yellow Cabs? Will you send a taxi to my home at 9625 Sunnyvale Way. And please hurry. No. Not in to L.A. To the town hall. To the police station. [ Doorbell ] Are you Mrs Bandle? - Yes. We've come for the clothes. Clothes? We came last week about the barrel of clothing our troop is sending to Europe. Oh. Yes. Just a moment. I have them in the laundry. Can we help you? Can we help you find them? Find what? The clothes. Here you are. Use this. But we aren't allowed to take money. - No. Only clothing. You said you had some old clothes. Well. I thought I did but .. Use this to buy something for your barrel. I don't know. Something nice and new. Alright. I need this for my cab. Thank you. - Thank you very much. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - Bill. Hi. Freddy. Freddy. Where is my brother? He's not here. Not here, huh? That's alright. I can wait. I got nothing to do in particular. What's the matter with you? What are you so hard-nosed about? Better close that door, Jane. You're letting the flies in. If you're hinting for me to go, just remember .. I'm a very coarse fellow. I don't understand the subtle signs. You look pretty dressed up, Jane. Expecting somebody for dinner? You never get dressed up like that just to welcome Freddy home. Who are you expecting? Whom are you expecting? Which is it? No kidding. I want to know. Who or whom? You're always trying to tell people how they should talk. Freddy. Jane, there's a dog out here in the back. Is he yours? [ Dog barking ] Don't tell me Freddy went and got himself a dog. He must have smelled the meat. That's pretty neat. Pretty neat. You know. If I was smart I'd invite myself to dinner. But of course, I'm not so smart. Mighty sharp. Aren't you afraid these fresh vegetables will get wilted? Why not put them in the refrigerator? Maybe you need a little helper? A frail woman like you with a whole house to take care of by herself. No wonder you slip up on things like this. Beer. I'll go for one of these. I always like a nice cold bottle of cold beer on a warm day. I always had weakness for it. Always had a weakness for beer any day, I guess. Especially at the beach. Remember? We went to the beach a lot, Freddy and me. It was swell down there. After the sun went down we'd light a fire and have a picnic with beer. First it was just Freddy and me. Then Freddy started bringing along girls. He laughed when I wanted to get me a girl. Said I'd better wait until I got into high school. Then. You got into the picture. You were the one he was always with. How do you like that? Gabardine stains too. Where are the kitchen towels? In there? Here you are. You're going to use a clean towel? Aren't you being a little extravagant? It's my right sleeve and I'm clumsy with my left hand. Would you mind? Isn't it dandy having a wife all to yourself. Remind me to try it sometime. Want to get rid of this? Okay. A very neat job. No stain at all. You always did have a knack for fixing things. Yes, ma'am. You fixed me, didn't you? At least you thought you did. You didn't like your husband paying attention to his kid brother. As that meant he had to take time off from paying attention to you. So you fixed me. You fixed my wagon but good. Remember? Remember? That night when we were all round the fire at the picnic with drink and beer? And Freddy was trying to get me drunk just for laughs? Well. What do you know, a second. What do you want me to do, get drunk again? Well duchess, it'll take more than two cans of beer to do it this time. It's almost ten years ago and I still remember it. I stumbled over to where you sat in the shadows and sat down beside you. I tried to kiss you. Freddy had his back to us. You were up screaming in a minute. Saying stop it, stop it. Freddy had his arm around you asking you what happened. You said. Remember what you said? I remember. Boy, do I ever remember. You said: 'keep that filthy kid away from me'. That's what you called me, a 'filthy kid'. I was 18 years old, loaded to the gills with beer, and you call me a filthy kid. Do you think that's a very nice thing to do to a kid of 18? Break him up with his brother and get him that kind of reputation. Freddy never said anything about it but from that day on it was different. I could always tell he was thinking about it. And I always remember it was you who fixed it. Frankly, I can't figure how a guy like my brother ever got mixed up with you. You are pretty enough but .. And all those years of your talk about babies. Day in, day out. Showing him baby pictures in baby magazines. Taking him to the neighbours houses to show him their babies. I don't see how the guy put up with it. All he wanted was you. You didn't appreciate that. He wasn't enough for you. Shut up. Well. She's recovered her speech. The duchess can talk. Come on. Come on. Talk some more. No more talk? And I thought we were going to have such a nice, friendly conversation. What's the matter, nervous? Are you going to have another one of your sick headaches? What are you looking at? Watching the sun go down? Very poetic, isn't it. Artistic. Brings out the finer nature. You ought to have a long-haired artist paint a picture of you. Watching the sun go down. Only if they do that you ought to include me in it. Much more romantic. A man and a woman against the setting sun. The duchess has spirit. I like that. Get out of here. Get out of here or I will .. You'll what? I'll tell Fred everything. Everything? You'll tell him everything? Don't be such a square. Now I'm really going to begin on you. [ Car horn ] It was only the cab. I gave him four bits. I said you changed your mind. You had no right. - It was worth the four bits. I'm not done with you yet. - You had no right to send him away. Didn't I? I wouldn't do that if I were you. If you go out now you'll miss some very interesting company. One person in particular. A lady you have a lot in common with. Mrs Dennis Williams. That's a good girl. You got more company coming too that you don't know about. Mrs Williams' husband. Dennis Williams. You know him. Don't you? Then there's Freddy. They're all going to be here. And me too. I'm going to stick around. The seventh race. I got a horse in that one. "Now, by arrangement with the Daily Racing form sheet." "We have the results of the 7th race at Santa Anita turf club in California." "In the 7th at Santa Anita." Bill. "Miss Grillo was the winner." "Number 11 Dinner Gong was second." Someday I'll learn to save my hard-earned money. Bill, please. What you just said. You were only teasing me, weren't you? Why should I be teasing you? You called them up and asked them to come here? At 5:30. It's that now. They should be coming any minute. So now you see why I didn't want you to go out. You can't run away from this. Things have a way of catching up. You know the golden rule: 'Do unto others ..' You did me. You hired the detective. Not Fred. - That's right. Now I am doing you. I've waited for this day for a long time. Now I'm backstage calling the curtain. I'll watch the four of you put on the neatest show you ever saw. I bet that Don Juan boyfriend of yours blew his top when he got my message. He called you, didn't he? And you were going to hop a cab and skip out of my little gathering. My dear sister-in-law, I wouldn't have you miss this for all the rice in China. The only one I'm worried about is Fred. He is going to be hurt. But he'll get over it. And he'll be a very happy guy with you out of his life. The big thing I'm looking forward to is you two. You and that joker. When you two are fact to face with his wife and your husband. You know, I get a kick thinking about that. Like the music? It's kinda sad. High class. Your type. But it's very fitting for this occasion. [ Doorbell ] Almost on the nose. Overture. Curtain going up. Allow me. This is my pleasure. Mrs Williams? Won't you come in? Has Mr Williams arrived yet? No. But we're expecting him. I am Bill Bandle. I'm the one who phoned you. This is my sister-in-law Jane Bandle. Oh. Yes. How do you do? Will you have a chair? Yes. Yes, thank you. Mr Bandle ought to be coming alone any minute. I don't know what's keeping the others. They should be here by now. I'll wait until they're all here before I explain in detail what this is about. May I light your cigarette? You and Mr Williams live over in Beverly Hills, don't you? Yes. A lovely part of town. I like it there very much. Of course, Bel-Air is nice too. Beverly Hills is best. I used to cover that territory. Beverly, Westwood, Brentford. Right on out. - Really? What do you do? I am a liquor salesman. Oh. It's a very interesting field of endeavour. You meet all kinds of people from all walks of life. You get a chance to study human nature in the raw. Develop an understanding of psychology. You know. See how people's minds work. Uhuh. You have to or else you don't sell. You got to be able to figure out any angle see. Or. You don't sell. Do you work, Mrs Bandle? No. I am sorry. I didn't hear you. No. I don't. You must be kept pretty busy yourself, Mrs Williams. Why do you say that? Running a big household. Parties. Raising your children. Getting them off to school. You seem to know quite a lot about my life. Well. I don't mean to be personal. It's just that .. You know. - I know. Were you able to reach my husband? No. I left a message at the office. His secretary said he'd been in and gone but that he'd be back. He always drops by in the afternoon. Even if he's been gone all day. Yes. I left this address and phone number with my housekeeper. In case he should call home before he left the office. Then we're covered. I mean, he's bound to get the message. One way or another. Do you have the time? Five-forty. I wonder where they are. What is wrong, Mrs Bandle? You're trembling. That means someone is walking over your grave. It's nothing. They ought to be here pretty soon now. You know, when we were in school we had a saying. When we were late we had to write: 'Punctuality is the politeness of Princes' a hundred times. Punctuality is the politeness of Princes? Yeah. A hundred times. Is that from Shakespeare? I don't remember where that's from. Please. There's something I want to tell you both. Jane. You're interrupting our conversation. Do you mind? I want to tell you something. - Sure. But later. But. It will hold until Freddy and Mr Williams get here. Let's change this creepy music. I think Beverly Hills is really a pretty beautiful part of town. This is the emergency operator. May I help you? - I want .. Hang up. It won't do you any good to call a cab. You cannot get out of this. Come on. Please. Just a minute. I want to fix myself up. Okay. But I'm leaving the door open. Don't try any more monkey business with the phone. Freddy too. I told him I wanted to see him here at 5:30. That's when he would meet all of us. He'll be along in a minute. Traffic is pretty heavy I guess. Everyone is driving home. Gee. Now look what's happened. Holy smokes. I didn't see you. It's alright. Hold it a second. It's my wife. What were you doing, out for a walk? You busted a heel? You shouldn't wear heels in a street like this. What a day I had. Everybody wanted to argue. I'll tell you about it after we eat. And I mean eat. Boy, I could eat a horse. What do you say, Charlie? Hiya, Frank. I got a surprise for you. Behind us in the truck back there. There is Bill's car. I forgot about him. He told me he was coming over but he wouldn't say why. I hope he isn't looking for another touch. I should think it's probably that. Who's car is that? The doohickey. You put it up there. Okay? Come on. Hi, Billy. Hi, Fred. How are you? - Tired. You know. There you are, Janey. I thought she'd tried to run out on us. - I got a surprise. Yeah? Kid, you're putting on the beef. You know that? Mrs Williams. I'd like you to meet my brother Fred Bandle. How do you do, Mrs Williams? - How do you do? Not bad. Watch your step with the kid here. He's a mighty smooth operator. Aren't you his date? Mrs Williams is here on a serious matter. No offense intended. I just thought that for a minute .. Right in the door. Wait until you see this. - Freddy. There's something I want to talk about. - In a minute. Here. Put it right here. On the phone you said you knew why I wanted you and Mr Williams to come here. Yes. While we wait for Mr Williams to get here .. I'll take my brother outside and give him the whole story. What's the matter? - Does he not know? No. - Nothing? Not a blessed thing. Oh. He is a very sweet person. I'm afraid this will be a bit of a jolt to him. Yes. I am sure it will. What do you think? - It's a honey. Jane. Jane. Don't you know what it is? It's a television set. Just wait until they get that doohickey up on the roof. What do you call it? Antenna. - That's it. Just wait. Prizefights, wrestling, live baseball. Where's the outlet? - What? The power. - In the wall behind the radio. I'll get to work on the roof. Do you need any help? A ladder? - No thanks. We have everything. Well. Why are you doing this? I am curious. That's a funny question coming from you of all people. He is my brother. It's the only decent thing to do. The decent thing? Look. Now don't anyone touch these knobs. Fred. I want to see what they're doing up on the roof. Look. This is important. I've got to talk to you. It can wait. - No. I can't wait. What is it that's so important it can't wait? I'd rather tell you outside. - Sure. Will you excuse us please? I would like to talk to you. Come on. Sit down. You know. As the wronged wife .. I am supposed to hate you. But I don't. Does that surprise you? I don't like you. I think you're a fool and a weakling. That brother-in-law of yours hates you. He really hates you. I don't envy you having him around all these years. Please. There's something I must .. - Wait. There's several things I want to get off my mind. First. I knew Dennis was after somebody. I didn't know who. But I knew what you'd be like. You see, I've been married for fourteen years. You come to know a person through and through in fourteen years. And I know Dennis. He's a many-sided man and I must say some of his sides are pretty attractive. The Dennis you know could charm the birds right out of the trees. But when you get to know what that charm really is .. It's pretty shoddy. I don't know what he said about us. But I imagine he's told you we don't understand. That he holds no moral obligation as far as we're concerned. He'd have to say that to keep your picture of him clean. Am I right? I knew he'd found somebody. Because lately he's been so kind and so considerate and attentive at home. You see, this has happened before. Twice. Once about ten years ago. He never knew that I knew. Then two years ago. It happened again. That lasted a couple of weeks. And now you. This time he's going to realize that I know. It will hurt him. It will hurt him very much. I know his love for me and the children has nothing to do with this. Still, I don't want it to happen again. I understand it. But it hurts just the same. And. All you three women are so alike. So very much alike. Of course. The other two weren't married. Neither are you in the full sense of the word. If you were, you wouldn't be so taken in with Dennis. If you really understood him .. You'd know that he's a man with a tremendous desire to be worshipped. And you worshipped him. I'm telling you this because I want you to stop it. Things are going to be different from now on. Do you understand all this? It's not true. It's not true? Why? Because you don't want it to be true? It's not true. - I tell you this for your own good. It's not true. It is true. And when he gets here I'm going to tell you what he's going to say. He's going to say that he loves me and that he wants to stay with me. When he kissed you and said he loved you .. He only did it to see the look of worship on your face. To hear you say you loved him, you adored him. He closed his eyes and believed he was a great lover, a great hero. Stop it! Don't say it anymore. Don't say it anymore. Don't be such a fool. Have you stopped to think what's going to happen to you now? That brother-in-law of yours is going to see that you don't get a penny. Have you any way of earning your own living? Do you have any children, Mrs Bandle? What a pity. You have no-one to love you. You are quite alone. I feel sorry for you. Really I do. You never loved him. What? You never loved him. It depends on what you mean by love. I mean. Love. You never heard a word I said. Why? Have you anything to say? It's no good, Freddy. I tried to tell you that years ago. Remember? I guess you forgot what happened but it's been on my mind ever since. She was no good then too. Now you believe me. Don't you, Freddy? Don't you? Well? What have you got to say? Answer me. Say something. Don't. Don't do it, Freddy. - Let go. She has this coming to her. You fool. That's what she wants you to do. What? What's that? Do you want her to file a counter suit? What? She'll claim you beat her up. Don't you see? Look at her. She's just waiting for you to hit her again. You see. Look. I'm ashamed of that. I never thought I'd live to hit a woman. We understand, Freddy. It's just that .. It's like the ceiling fell in. Married for years and years and then .. All of a sudden you find out you don't know the person. You don't know her at all. Well. Let's get on with it. We have to wait until Mr Williams gets here. What time did you tell him to be here? - Left a message at his office at 5:30. It's getting late. - Yeah. Maybe I should call his office again. No. He never works this late. I'll lay you odds he won't show. Maybe you're right. A guy like that who would play around with another man's wife. Yep. He won't show. Perhaps he hasn't received the message. He got the message alright. You know? - He called her to tip her off. He did? - She called a cab when I got here. He told you to meet him someplace? - I doubt he did that. Did he? I say he ran out on her. Left her in the lurch. She wouldn't think much of him if he did that. Why should he? Come back tomorrow. I thought you wanted it set up tonight special. Come back tomorrow. I'll fix it for your extra trouble. Okay. Alright. Where did he run off to? Where is he? Talk. You keep on talking. You talk all the time. I tried to tell you. I wanted to tell you. But you wouldn't listen. He is here. He is here. He's been here all the time. He's here. Come on, come on. Where is he? Well, so what? It was a dream. It never happened. Where is he? Where is Dennis? Look. Bill, look. On the floor. It's blood. What's happened? What's happened? Where is he? It leads this way. He must have headed for the orange groves. Somebody call an ambulance. - I'll do it. The emergency hospital please. This is urgent. Where did they go? - To the receiving hospital. Mandy and I came up this street and we saw a man come out of that driveway. He had his hands on his chest like this. Very pale and his shirt had all blood on one side. He had a car parked here and tried to get in it but couldn't. He tried to open the door with his elbow. Then the ice cream van stopped. - Where are they? Where did they go? To the receiving hospital, he said. - In Van Nuys? Yes. This man. Was he hurt bad? He was awfully pale. And blood. He looked like his heart hurt him. But it was the wrong side. Your heart is here. He was hurting here. How long ago was this? - About half an hour ago. Yes? Yes, doctor. How? He told you to tell me what? Yes. You tell him I love him too. Is it alright if I come right now? Can I see him? Yes. Right away. What's the word? - He's alright. It's his lung but the doctor says he'll be alright. Of course something could happen. But he's alright. What happened? I mean did the doctor say how it happened? Yes. He told me Dennis slipped while he was holding a skewer. A barbecue skewer. Yeah? It slipped? Sounds fishy to me. I bet he's covering up for her. Why don't you leave here alone? I'm not making trouble but if she stabbed your husband .. She's not the kind who could. He is alright. Forgive me. Just like that. 'Forgive me'. She steals your husband. She stabs him. She scares you half to death. 'Forgive me'. I forgive her. I suppose she's gone in there to have herself a good cry. I mean, she must feel sorry for herself. You're going to take your husband back? After all this? Don't concern yourself with what I'm going to do. Put your own house in order, Mr Bandle. My house? And hers. Mrs Bandle. Mrs Bandle. - Leave her alone. Is there anything inside she could take? Sleeping tablets? I don't know. Jane. Mrs Bandle. Jane. Jane. Let me in. Jane. Jane. Jane. Unlock the door. [ Door knocks ] Come on, Jane. Unlock the door! What's the matter with you? Why didn't you open the door? Why are you acting like this? No. No. Get some bandages or something quickly. Hold still Jane and be quiet. There's no excuse for that. Be still, will you. Excuse me. Emergency surgery. This is Mack. Bringing in a slashed wrist. Attempted suicide. Yeah. Ten minutes. One of you bring her things. Things? - Tooth brush, etc. Nightgown. That sort of stuff. I'll come along and ride with her. You go to the receiving hospital? - Yes. She should have somebody with her. You see, I'm going there anyway. Any rush on getting her stuff over there? Tell her I'll be over later. Look, fellow. Report this is an accident. An accident. Don't wear that coat, Freddy. It's all messed up. It's been pretty much of a shock, Freddy. A great shock. I know. But it's over now. Like you reach the end of a chapter in a book. You turn a page and everything's new. You will see. Like driving up a long hill in second all the way. Suddenly you're at the top and there's a whole new world spread out for you. Don't want to wear that coat, Freddy. It doesn't look right. Try this. It goes more with your pants. - Leave me alone. Freddy. It'd been rough. Sure. I know it's been rugged. But listen. Believe me it's for the best. I know it hurts. Getting rid of her was like pulling out a rotten tooth. But it's out now. You still feel where it was hurting. Freddy. I got a great idea. We take my car and run down to Mexico for a few days. Down at Ensenada and get the sun. You need the sun. We lie around on the beach and get a load of that Mexican beer and tequila. Remember? And I know a dame that works down there in one of those hotels. Cut it. Okay, okay. No dames. Just you and me, Freddy. You don't know what it means. Sure. Sure. Let's get out of here. This is it. This is it. You and me. A couple of slap-happy sons-of-guns with the whole ahead of us. Blood is thicker than water, Freddy. You know that. My brother Freddy. If mum were alive she would be glad that it's like this. That it's come back to being like this. You don't want to do that. I'll take care of that detail. It's not for you to do that. I'll fix things. That's my job. I'm going to take you out and get some hot food in you. A good steak and you'll feel better. You'll feel great. Then while you're having your coffee I'll dump this stuff off. And fill out all the forms at the hospital. You really hate her, don't you? - Yeah. Why? Well, I don't exactly hate her. It's just that I saw what she was doing to you and .. You know. No. I don't know. Wouldn't you have followed it up? Followed it up? You didn't follow up anything. You've been scheming it. What? What I said. You've been scheming it. You find something happening that doesn't look right. Do you come to me and give it to me straight? No. You put detectives on her trail. You play it close and cagey until you figure you got a pat hand. And you walk in here with it all set up. Everybody invited to the big surprise. You're wrong, Freddy. You got it all wrong. You think so, huh? If you got to wear that coat let me at least fix it so it looks halfway decent. There you are. I guess that about does it. Here, Fred. Let me take this. Freddy, what's wrong? You. I got a good, clear sight of you. I can see what you've been doing. What you've been doing for years. It was there all the time only I was too dumb blind to look. Everything I did was to help you. I only did it .. Because you wanted to help. Yes. I know. Don't let me start remembering. There are lots of things to remember. Fred, you're talking wild. You don't .. - I'm talking sense. I had a good wife and a nice home. But you were jealous. You found out you couldn't have her so you didn't want me to have her either. You got me into an easy-going crowd that she couldn't fit in with. Poker parties lasting all night. Fun. Fun she couldn't have a part of. The past few years we rarely spent an evening together, just the two of us. I can see it all now. What's happened is more my fault than hers. Freddy, I'm trying to tell you she's no good for you. I proved it to you. I got the affidavits here to prove it. - Forget them! Freddy. - Take your hands off me. What's the matter? What you running back to? She wants no part of you. She doesn't love you anymore. Freddy. Have you forgot what she did to you? She's nothing but a two-timing, double-crossing cheat. Don't you ever call her that again. And keep away from us. That's the first time you ever hit me, Freddy. Anybody else had done that I'd kill 'em. No. You can't do it, Freddy. Come back. Freddy, stop the car. Stop the car, Freddy. Don't do this to yourself. Stop the car! She's no good for you, Freddy. She's no good for you. Don't go back to her. She's not worth it. Freddy! You fool. You stupid hair-brained fool. Freddy. Freddy. You fool. You stupid, hair-brained fool. ..f-s..
