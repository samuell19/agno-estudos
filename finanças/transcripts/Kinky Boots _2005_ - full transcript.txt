Come on, you stupid boy. Okay now, Charlie. I'm gonna show you the most beautiful thing in the world. - Do you know what it is? - A shoe. A lot of people would say it'd be an oak tree in spring. It's a shoe. Lot of people would say it'd be a field of woodland flowers. Do you know what I think it is, Charlie? A shoe. I think it's a shoe. Every machine. You'll learn how to work every machine, Charlie. And by the time you're old enough-- and married probably-- taking over the factory from me. Believe me, first thing you notice about a person... is their shoes. Come on. Whoo-hoo! You know, it's funny. It's always struck me that in terms of love, strength... and attention to detail, marriage is pretty much like-- A pair of shoes. And today, again I'm not wrong. They take you to places perhaps you weren't expecting. My son, off to London. His fiancée had been transferred to an even bigger estate agent's. And, Charlie, what have you decided to try your hand at down there? Marketing. To my future daughter-in-law... and to my wonderful son. - Charlie! - Charlie! Ah, Mr. Price. Do let me show you around. This is the new layout, designed very much with the young couple in mind. As you can see, one good size bedroom with en suite shower room. And, uh, through here, fully furnished lounge. Oh, and best of all, Mr. Price, best of all-- the view. It's not Northampton. It's not Northampton. No! ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no, no! ♪ ♪ We're not in Northampton anymore ♪ Oh. ♪ We're going where the sun shines brightly ♪ Hello? Hello? ♪ We're going where the sky is blue ♪ Sorry.

He'd have been proud of you coming back, Mr. Price. - Charlie. - Price Factory has to have a Mr. Price, Mr. Price. George. Bugger. Um-- Dad always used to say that-- and, uh-- and in a sense-- He ain't pressed the button. My heart is-- Uh, press the red button. That was a good start. Right. I'm not my dad, okay? You shouldn't expect that. But I have spent my life with each one of you at some point, um, training on these... machines. I was bloody useless. Too right. Thanks, Don. Listen, Dad believed... there would always be a place for craftsmanship. And whether you realize it or not, that is what you all are-- craftsmen. So let's make shoes! "Let's make shoes"? Oh! Oh, don't worry, love. Don't get it on your jacket. I'll get some roll. Pat, what order is the company working on at the moment? Uh, it's a big one, love. Chambers Wholesale. Why? What the hell was he playing at? I mean, why didn't he-- Why did he carry on making 'em? This happened before. 1992. Customer went into receivership, and your dad got stuck with 600 Oxfords. And? Bill Sampson in London took 'em at cost. Right. Pat, I'm going to London. See, Harry, I just happened to find myself with 1,200 pairs of brogues. And I know a few years back... your dad took some at cost off my dad, and I just thought maybe-- Yeah, but that was a few years back, Charlie. Things have changed a bit. But look. I'll tell you what. I'll take 200 pairs off your hands-- for old time's sake. Hey, and this hurts. Being a Forest fan, giving charity to a Northampton, uh-- I mean, when I say "charity," I'm not, uh-- You know. Mmm. Imported from Slovakia. Do you wanna know how much? Harry, a Prices shoe will last a man a lifetime. Poor soul that buys these will be back in 10 months buying new ones. I know. And isn't that great? Spare some change, guv? Here. This is a Prices shoe. And it'll last a man a lifetime. You got it in a size 10? Yeah, slow yourself down a bit, will ya? Covering something, princess? Hey, where's the fire, love? Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! Where do you think you're going? Don't worry. I'm not gonna harm you. Just have a little chat. That's all. All right, lads. Hey, easy, love. Easy. - What? You wanna, mate? - I think you should just-- just leave her alone now. - Don't you think? - Yeah? Come on, then. Eh? Don't you? What are you gonna do about it, eh? Let's go. Very sweet-- you riding to my rescue. Very... Prince Charming. - Pass me my boobs, will ya? - Hmm? Here. It didn't look like you needed much rescuing. Well, a girl has to know how to look after herself these days. There are some very funny people out there. How's that wound? Let's have a look. Don't flatter yourself. Vodka. Helps you forget pain. Well, it does me. God. Clean off, again. Like most things in life, it cannot stand the weight of a man. Oh, there we go. Oh, God love us. Oh. Uh, hold on.

Trish, Trish. - Thing is-- - Don't. Please. Please. They just started school. They just started school this month, Charlie. This is their uniforms, love. This-- This is their dinners. We lost the contract with Chambers, Trish. Thing is, we lost the contract with Chambers, which means-- Actually, don't. Actually, this is like apologies for your train running late. - Doesn't mean anything. - It's not like that because-- So I'd rather not hear it. I do mean it. Bernie Kylie to the office. Please. This is not what I want, Bernie. I don't want to be sitting here doing this. But you know-- Nine out of 10 shoe factories are shut down, and-- What can I do? I am sorry it's come to this, Antony. Stephanie. Dennis. - Derrick? - Eric. Yes. Eric. What can I do? Do? Do? Do? - Change the product. - I'm sorry? Like Liptons. Start making equestrian boots. Browns, they're making-- Oh, whatever. Right. Climbing boots. All them other sods, they went out looking for their niche markets. I mean, they just didn't sit back in their offices going, "What can I do?" I'm sorry. I was just really, really looking forward to a Chinese tonight. Now I'm not sure if I can afford it. In a sense, it was lucky, really, that they hadn't got round to advertising your job. Hmm. Yeah, lucky. Listen, Nic-- Oh, wow. That's the kind of shoe, isn't it? Don't you think? What? The wedding. At the altar. Is that the kind of thing you were thinking of? Yeah. On my foot. Well, it needs to be a Jimmy Choo, doesn't it, to work. Or a Manolo. We might have to think about the wedding, Nic. Hmm? Not the wedding wedding, but-- It doesn't have to be all live band and shoes at the altar and all. Does it? I mean, at the end of the day, it's about the two of us, isn't it? I-I made 15 people redundant today, Nic. Lauren. Lauren, you haven't heard what I was gonna say. Well, does it involve the words "job back"? Potentially. Okay, brace yourself.

Well, he was my boss. I got laid off. But now he seems to think I'm his business analyst or-- Uh, look, Lola. You're gonna have to excuse Charlie. Uh, we don't have many transvestites in Northampton. I'm not merely a transvestite, sweetheart. I'm also a drag queen. It's a simple equation. A drag queen puts on a frock, looks like Kylie. Transvestite puts on a frock, looks like Boris Yeltsin in lipstick. There. I said it. Ta. Whatever. Don't kid yourself. You're never more than 10 feet away from a transvestite. - Hmm. - You made her redundant, you miserable sod. Things aren't very good in men's shoes. No. I'm not, certainly. Yes. Ha. Precisely. How much do you weigh? The right amount. How much do you drink? No. I mean, um-- They're women's boots, aren't they, that you buy? You have to buy women's boots because you-- You see, the distribution of pressure on a conventional female heel... cannot be expected to support a man's weight. Yeah, and if trans-- you know, whatevers-- drag queens are everywhere, like you said, then-- Not in a... ooh, living dead kind of way, but-- Then do you think there is a niche market... for proper, good, decent, built-to-last boots for women... that are men? All this way for my advice. I feel like Oprah. I'd like to measure your foot, go home, make a pair. Who gets to keep the boots? Little warning. The answer is, "You do, Lola." You do, Lola. Where do I come to pick it up? Oh. Prices of Northampton, is it? Yeah. Yeah. Um, I'll come to you. Oh, no, no. As they say, a good pair of boots is worth walking for. No. You see, I come here all the time, and so-- I'll come to you. Right. Um, look behind you. What? What is it? It's your niche market, Charlie. Big niche.

I'm gonna need someone on the Web to research markets, and, you know, if Pat got on some of those Web sites, I think she'd have a heart attack. Yeah. Besides, you started it, being in that strop. Oh, well-- I mean, I just had the strop, Charlie. You saw the idea. And that is why some of us... end up with our names above the factories... and others just on the clocking-in cards. Right. Well, as someone with their name on a factory, can I invite you to have your name on one of my clocking-in cards? They say-- Calm down. They say whatever life throws at you, whatever emotions you could ever feel, somebody somewhere has written a song about it. Now I hope that will be true. But until somebody writes a song called "No One Stays Young Forever, and One Day I Hope You Get Dumped for a Younger Model, You Whiny Little Welsh Bastard," I'm just gonna have to sing you "Memory." Show us your tits! Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, there they are. Give 'em a round of applause. Thank you. Are they as wrinkly as your arms, love? Is there a man in there? Yeah, good one. I have to-- I have to tell you, sweetheart. My-- My breasts are as smooth and beautiful as the day that I bought them. Get yourself a refund then. Bastard. Oh. Hey, aye. Forget it, Don. Out of your league. Ah. Seem to forget women get turned on by the sight of a working man. - Morning, Charlie. - Lola. Come in. I'm sorry it's a bit messy here, and we, uh-- Uh, I thought we agreed that I'd come to London. I have to warn you, Charlie from Northampton, I have a terrible habit of doing exactly the opposite of what people want. This way. In fact, some might say that attempts of certain people... to make a man out of me as a child is exactly the reason that I now wear a frock. If, therefore, I get the feeling somebody didn't want me to come to Northampton-- - No. No, no, no, no. - Also, I can tell from years of experience... when I'm being smuggled in through a rear door. Oh, that's the rough stuff room. - Is it? - That's where we dump all the off-cuts and misshapes. There you go. I wondered why I was being drawn to it. Pardon? Nothing. All right, sir. Hmm? Oh! George. Listen, Mel. All I'll say is that when it comes to attracting women, some men don't have to speak. Hah. This is cozy. Here we are. Well? What do you think? Burgundy. Please, God, tell me I've not inspired something burgundy. Red. Red. Red! Red,Charlie boy! Red... is the color of sex! Burgundy is the color of hot water bottles. Red is the color of sex and fear and danger... and signs that say "Do... not... enter." All of my favorite things in life. Who's that? He's got your new girlfriend in there. But they're comfy. Comfy? Sex shouldn't be comfy! Thank God. I thought it was just me. Now I don't know what you're used to making around here, Charlie boy, but now you're making sex. Two-and-a-half feet of irresistible, tubular sex. I mean, that heel! For God's sake! Yeah, they won't break. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Not if it means having to go around looking like a bloody Ukrainian peasant. - Well, it's better than flouncing around like a-- You want to show your niche market a little more respect, Charlie boy. I mean, let's ask your girls. No! Girls. Would you wear something like this to go out? No! But you'd look all right in 'em, sweetheart. Mmm. You've pulled. Oh, yeah. Ladies. Ooh. Well, I'm very flattered, but, frankly, if you can't get women to wear 'em-- you'll never get blokes like me to wear 'em. Do we still have a workforce? Don'll come around. Once he's stopped, uh-- walking up and down, swearing. - Well, that's his problem. - No. It's our problem, Lola. This is Northampton. You have no idea what it's like, okay? It's not Soho. Amen. Look to the heel, young man. The sex... is in the heel. Now what's that supposed to mean? "Sex is in the heel"? Stilettos require constant balance from the upper leg, causing the muscles of the backside... to tense and appear pert and ready for mating. It's physically impossible. I mean, am I missing something? To make a stiletto, something that thin, bear the weight of a man is just-- Steel shank. What? A steel shank, cut thinly... then molded in a continuous section from toe to heel without pinning. Not even Don would crush that. Lola! Lola, we might be able to do it. Steel shanks without underpinning. We might be able to make those boots. If you could just-- If you were willing to, you know-- I think Don would have something to say about that, don't you? I gave up the provinces years ago, Charlie, and I've just been reminded why. Lola doesn't do north. Northampton's the Midlands. No, Charlie. Tottenham Court Road is the Midlands. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a show tonight. Yeah. Well, I'm stood here, trying to save a factory of four generations-- of my father and his father's father-- Well, come on, Charlie. Tell me when that applies to me, will you? And how it applies to you. 'Cause I'm about to take an almighty fucking gamble, and in one afternoon, in one drawing, you've said more about these boots than-- I mean, I just-- Five weeks, Lola. That's it. I mean, if I don't have a new collection ready for the Milan Shoe Fair... in five weeks, I'll have blown it. I'm gonna have to sell the place. All right. I'll tell you what. Don't hang around. It's never gonna apply to you. What you don't realize, Lola, is this is not my world either. Where you going, darling? By the sound of it, Milan. I see this as a very positive step-- for a company who's spent the last century making a range of shoes for men... to start the next century making shoes for... a range of men. Any questions? Oh, sorry, love. Sorry. I thought you said you were going in to work at 9:00. No. I did, Mrs. Cobb. I was. I am. Sorry. Don! Have you got any toilets down here? I'm afraid we've only got men's and women's. Charlie. She's locked herself in the loo. What? Come on. Right. Go in there, tell her-- No. The gents' loo. Right. Who's that man? I don't know. Lola, it's Charlie. Are you okay? Are you ill? Yeah, I'm sick. Ask your boys. It this Don? Oh, has he nicked your dress? I came like this. Mmm. God. Put on a frock, and I can sing "Stand By Your Man" in front of 500 strangers. Put on a pair of jeans, and I can't even sodding well say hello. I have to say, I was going to suggest dressing down. Well, thank you for your concern. Is he crying? Shh, shh. Shh. Come on. Tell me. Boxer. Get out of here. I'm serious. Yeah, he had me doing training, weights. I could bench-press 93 kilos. I owe all my spectacular muscle definition to my father. What, and he never-- The whole wearing frocks thing-- Oh, well, he wasn't stupid. He knew there'd be very few cross-dressing heavyweight champions of the world. Yeah. No. He disowned me. Wouldn't see me. Even when he got lung cancer, he wouldn't. So-- It's ironic, really. Fags got him in the end. I mean, that's what it was all about. Fitting in. Melding in. Not standing out. As far as he was concerned, if you're big and you're black and you're a boxer, then you are sorted. If you're big and you're black and you're in a-- you know-- strapless cocktail dress, that's not so good. That's what my dad wanted and all. Strapless cocktail dress? Yeah. No. For me to fit in, to this place. You know it should be me that's hiding in here, not you. I'm the one who doesn't know what he's doing. God. It'd kill him to hear me say that too. Although he probably knew, and that's probably what did. Well-- Perhaps we just have to pretend we do know what we're doing. Charlie from Northampton, Simon from Clacton. Come on. Let's make boots.

Things got a little bit crazy at work, and-- It won't always be like that. I promise. No. It really-- It won't be. Okay. Pssh, pssh. And, uh-- See, I think I've found a solution for the factory. Well, that makes two of us. Come on. One second, Mrs. Cobb. Oh, God. Come in. There we go. Thank you. Oh. And the room's all right for you then, love, is it? It's absolutely lovely, Mrs. Cobb, yes. Lots of, um-- Lots of trinkets. Ah. Now, well, the little pottery shoes-- They're good luck, you see. You know, like Whitby has lucky glass ducks, Northampton has lucky pottery shoes. Can I just ask, are you a man? I am, love, yes. Ah. That's fine. Just so's I know how to leave the toilet seat. I'll get some biscuits. Mr. Price. Charlie, this is Richard Bailey. I was sorry to hear about your dad. Shall we? The beauty is the building. For us developers, it's more a case of what we don't do. Isn't it? And if you look in here, you will see... the bedroom. So? What do you think? We, uh-- I mean, one day, Nic, if it's what you want, but-- Isn't it slightly out of our price range? Not all buildings deserve a second life, Mr. Price, but factories like this-- like yours-- they're special. I'm sorry. Are you under the illusion that Prices is for sale? Look, I know you're trying to help, but if you'd just hang in there a bit, I make you this promise. Oh, is this a promise like the Jimmy Choo shoes wedding promise? Hang on a minute. You're talking about the history of my family there. Yet isn't this the future of it right here? Well, I don't know, Nicola. Is it? I mean, if I can't get you to summon up a bit of faith and just-- Okay. Give me it, Charlie. Go on. What have I got to have faith in? Now I've suggested selling the factory to a brilliant developer... who's interested and who's done all that. You know, made all that happen. What's your plan? Charlie boy! I found Soho! A little corner of Soho in Northampton, that brasserie. I mean, we're not talking Hoxton here, but never mind. I'm sorry. I'm Lola. I'm the one designing his range of transvestite boots. This-- There's a slight chill... in the air, isn't there? Yeah. That is... the-- The plan. Yeah. Listen, Nic. I have not gone into this lightly, and there is a market f-f-- Can I just say, before you make a fool of yourself trying to save the factory... because "It's the history of my family, Nicola"-- The reason Richard came to see me, okay, not you, was because your dad had approached him about selling up. You see, you owe your father nothing, Charlie Price. You are free to walk. Right. That's it. We've terminated production on all derbies, brogues and Oxfords. From now on, the factory is 100% on the new range, or we will not hit Milan. So we need at least 15 new designs from Lola... and at least six samples of each. And remember, you are not making footwear. You are not making boots. You are making two and a half feet... of irresistible, tubular sex! None of the major firms just take a stand. All of the big boys hire the main runway, so we will need that. And we need Milan to go like, pow! Like-- Like the two of us did that night at The Angel, yeah? I mean, we need to take The Angel Club to Milan. We will take The Angel Club to Milan. Well, you wouldn't put a frock on. If you don't want to get off with blokes, why would you put a frock on? Thing is, Mike, ask any woman what she likes most in a man. Compassion, tenderness, sensitivity-- traditionally the female virtues. Perhaps what women secretly desire... is a man who is fundamentally a woman. Huh? Huh. Hmm. He's coming. Right. Hello, Don. Tell me. What do you think I could do... that would make me more of a man? Got a piece of paper down here, Don. Why don't you write down what you think would make me more of a man, and I'll write down what I think would make you more of a man? If I do what's on yours, you do what's on mine, right? Piss off. Fine. So is our Don a man, do you think? Well, he dresses like one. Good answer. I was pleased with it. Right on, girl. Jolly good. Come on, Don. Be a man. You don't have to do this, you know. Oh, I do. And you want to know why? 'Cause what Don's written on my piece of paper... is a bloody walk in the park compared to what I've written on his. We've 24 hours. I could do without industrial unrest. Oh, calm down, Charlie. It's not boxing. Sorry. Hmm? Play. - Nice. - You can do it! Do it! Come on, Lola! You can do it! You can do it! Come on, Don. Yeah! Come on! Come on! Don! Don! Don! Oh, yes! So, the, uh-- Yeah, well-- Why'd you stop? Well, I wouldn't want you to walk into the factory... and feel that people didn't respect you, Don. I wouldn't want anyone else to know what that feels like. Oh. "Change your mind about someone." Nice one, chap. Get the beers in, eh? Yeah, Don. Get the beers in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, Christ! How much does that buy us? The main runway, from between 4:30 to 5:00-- after Closerie and before Tricker's. Okay. Hi. - Listen, I'm sorry. - We can't afford it. Mmm-- Just, just, just-- How much for the dancers? Oh. Well, all this is Lola's estimate for the Blue Angel boys-- their travel and their expenses. Could you get the whole thing for under 20,000? Hello. Are you there? Well, why 20? Could you? Tell me. Why 20? Because that is what the bank will give me against my house. Hello? What? Take it. Pronto! At least one Mr. Price didn't sit around saying, "What can I do?", eh? Take it. Come on, Mel! Tea break finished five minutes ago. Come on. You know where that goes. How are you getting on, George? Fine. It's surprisingly easy if I just imagine Pat wearing 'em. Is it? George. There's an indentation in the leather. Bin it. Do it again. I don't care. Redo it. What if they're not assembled by the end of the shift? They'll be assembled. Well, it's 4:00. I know when the end of shift is, Lauren. If they have to work over, they'll work over. This is bloody Milan. You don't get marks for effort. Hmm. Caffeine. Give us a hand, would you? I needed a break from Mr. Shouty back there. He's just tense, right? What? Are you aware that you do that? That you instinctively defend him? Wow. Look at those puppies. You know, Charlie's dad used to have this theory... that you could tell everything about a person from their shoes. Right. Come on, then. Oh, no. Go. Cheap, but happy. Oh. Very eager to please. All right. All right. Those. Those. Look. Shiny, but dull. Oh, my God! Hello, Lauren. Hello, Nicola. Oh, I love those shoes. Mmm. Charlie's treat? - Yeah, once upon a time. - What? A girl can live with so many once-upon-a-times... before she finally has to get the Visa out and buy them herself. Well, it's not like that at the factory though, is it? Sorry? Well, Charlie. Said he was gonna save it. I mean, most guys would have just gone, "Hey, you know. What can I do?" Yeah, I know. Fallen over at the first hurdle, let alone remortgage their house. I mean, you should see him in that factory, Nicola. It's like it's... made him twice as determined. I'm sorry. Remortgaged the-- What? Well. Hmm. How are we? No. No. No. For God's sake, Melanie. This is Milan. These seams aren't straight. You're rushing it. Pardon? You're gonna have to unpick all this and start again. Oh. Thought that might-- S-Saturday. What? You've got enough completed. No, I haven't. Some of us have got a life outside this factory. Right. You're gonna have a bloody lot more of it in a bit. Mel, you don't understand. This... is Milan. It's Mil-- How do you know what Milan is? You don't know. You're guessing. Perhaps you'd have it finished by now... if you hadn't made us undo every single bloody stitch. But, Mel, they weren't good enough! They'd have been good enough for your dad. But I'm not my dad! Hey! I'll tell you what, Charlie Price. Never a bloody truer word. - Mel. We have to leave at 6:00 in the morning. - Please! - Hello, Charlie! Nic, sorry. I'm actually in a bit of a... crisis here. Oh, I think so. Is it not bad enough you're making this kind of crap, - thinking you're gonna save the factory? - - Charlie! - But the fact you've remortgaged the house. - What? I-- Charlie, Lauren didn't realize. Our house. No one will ever say I didn't stand by my man, Charlie. I've done it. I'll stand by you now. Just-- Reason. - Nicola. - Give me a reason! Down there. Looking at you, Charlie Price. Give me a reason, standing here, making porn wear for... hermaphrodites. Well, actually, love, hermaphrodites have both sets of reproductive organs. Get out! Oh, God. Where was it for London, all this money? Don't. Flat the size of a postage stamp, because "We all know. We have to be careful, Nic." But, hey. Bloody presto-- London was for you. London was for us. You wouldn't spend another five grand on us, but you'll bloody remortgage the house... to keep a load of people we don't know in a job. I do know them. It's you that doesn't know them, because you never come in here. I've already had to fire 15 of them, and they were the 15 worst times of my life. - So sell it. - Nicola! I don't get-- Do they know your dad was gonna sell up? You know? Even your dad. Have you told them that? I don't care what he was gonna do! I don't care that he was gonna sell the place! Okay? I, here, me, now-- Charlie Price doesn't actually enjoy making people redundant! And if you can't hear a reason yet, Nicola, then maybe you won't ever get it! Maybe you won't ever get me! Maybe Nicola Marsden will never ever quite get Charlie Price. Maybe I won't. Oh. Sod it! It's probably my fault-- putting Dad up, making some hero out of him. Shouldn't do that. I suppose I just didn't want to be the last photo in the line. You know? The Price who left nothing. Maybe you shouldn't judge it in bricks, Charlie. Maybe you judge what you leave behind... by what you inspire in other people. Charlie? 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me, please. Coming through! Hurry up, then! Beep, beep! Coffee? Cup of tea? Lola. Charlie. Did you get them to do this? Rather rose to the challenge of changing his mind about someone. You? No, Charlie. You. Here we go! My God. Hey, everyone.

Potholers. They'd always have a celebration the night before they went down, in case they never came out. And of course, now Northampton is the perfect venue. - Oh, I, uh-- - Oh. A little warning. The answer is, "I'd love to, Lola." Stop it. Table for one? Uh, for two. Two. Right here. I'll just use the toilet. Toilets, yes. Just down the stairs, on the left. Richard. Oh, Christ. It's Charlie Price. Oh, no. Absolutely. From, um-- From Prices, yeah. I j-- Wow. Um-- Uh-- Didn't expect to see you at La Conceria. Not one of your normal haunts, this, is it? Yeah. I'm having a meeting. Sort of business. Business. God. That's, uh-- Never lets up, does it? Same with me. Hey. They're running away. Charlie boy! Sorry I'm late. You know how it is. I'm sitting there with all my dresses on my bed, and I'm thinking, "Is it hot in Milan? Is it cool? Does it get cold at night?" Oh. Thank you. Ooh. You couldn't get me a Bloody Mary, could you, sweetheart? Bloody Mary for the lady. The whole potholing thing. The whole-- I didn't mean it. I don't think it will go tits up, Charlie. I mean, the show, the routine! Wait till you see what I've got planned for the catwalk. - I mean, if we market it right-- - Could you talk a bit-- 'Cause it's not just us who'll go for 'em. There's a whole club scene as well, the whole metrosexual crowd-- Stop. What? People are staring. Come on. What do you want? You are a man in a frock in Northampton. Of course they're staring. Even if they're not looking, they're staring. I'm a-- I'm a Northampton shoe designer, Charlie. Yeah. You're that as well. You're also a man in a dress. You make it sound as if I put this on... because of a lack of a pair of trousers. Is there a part of you that actually believes that, Charlie? No. I don't know why you wear dresses. And I don't think you do either. I didn't realize I was causing you trouble! Forget it. All right? You are a very good designer. But actually, you'd like me to come up and design and then disappear when I'm me. Lola, "you" is the designer. This is not you. This is you in a dress, looking daft. All right? And you don't have to do it. I don't know what you think, if this is all part of dodging what sex you actually get off on. If you think you are somehow being mystical-- being, ooh, the best of either sex-- I have to tell you, Simon-- Simon. Stood there in a frock right now, you look like the worst bits of both. Stop hiding. Be brave. Decide one way or the other. And for my sake, tomorrow, please turn up looking like the picture on your passport. I can't change what I want, Charlie. I cannot... change what I want. I cannot do that. George. Hey. Hey! No Lola. Hmm? George. Mr. Price. Are we all set? Well, did she say she was gonna be late? No. Actually, she, um, said she was gonna fly out with the girls. What, from London? Hey.

They look quite dead like this. Don't worry, George. It'll be a different story tomorrow, eh? Look. That's us. Milan main catwalk. The Angel girls wearing our boys, eh, Charlie? Hey. You know, as Lola would say, there's a slight chill in the air, Charlie. And I'm getting worried because I don't know why. I had an argument with her. What? With Lola. Uh, last night in the restaurant. See-- See, she turned up in a dress, and I just-- I just-- She didn't go to London, did she? She didn't get on the plane at all. Look-- Lauren. There was a bloke that wanted to buy the factory-- Richard Bailey. He was there with Nicola at the restaurant, and I mean, I just-- All that, love, does not apply to me, all right? What applies is that there is nobody here to wear our boots... that we have worked our asses off to get here, Charlie. Okay. I-- Yes, I am sorry, but-- It's just I felt somehow useless as a man! Okay? Sitting there in the restaurant, I felt... somehow useless as a man. So here we are again, eh? Charlie Price, standing in front of me, saying, "It's not my fault.

Stand by your man, Lauren. Thank you. Bellissimo! Lola, this is, uh, Charlie from Northampton. I'm looking at a shoe fair program... with a big gap where you should be. But I have to say, unlike most people, wherever you leave, you leave a gap, Lola. You will in Northampton. You have in Milan. Listen, if people ever tell you, "You look half a man," you gotta remember, actually, that's fine. I mean, I don't know what half a man is. I don't know what the hell a man is. But I know that if it involves being brave, you are more of a man than I will ever be. Good-bye, Lola. Don't think that's why I came. I came for the adulation. ♪ ♪ Why am I leaving you? Aw! I'm afraid in life, Lola has always been drawn... to the most exciting, the most daring, the most... ♪ sexy. There is tell of a mystical place, far north of here, called Northampton. Exciting because it contains a shoe factory... struggling to survive against all the odds. Daring because it's run by a man... brave enough to recognize that a factory is its people, not its bricks. And sexy-- Well, because now I work there. The craftsmen of fantasy... for ladies, gentlemen... and those of you who are yet-- To make up your mind.
