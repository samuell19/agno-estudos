God-001 produces it instantly. Very handy God, isn't he? No time to talk like that. Ueda, by any chance you came here just because you worried about me. Dream on! I came here to tell you that I've no time to worry about you. Huh? I'm about to be very rich soon. Look! Who died here? A guy who eats from other people's dish and very pathetic one. TOIRE TSUMARU He has been looking for Tokugawa's buried treasure. This is the message pointing to the buried treasure. My friends are checking all toilets in Japan. You, idiot Ueda and his friends! A Message is not "Toire TSUMARU" (Toilet is stuck) Look right here. There is something used to hook the plate. A Message was written on the other board. When it fell, Characters were transferred to the floor. The board was taken by someone. No way! Bana Sokana ( Sonna Bakana) Then, what was the original message? All you must do is to flip these characters. Look through characters from the back side. Then, you can read the original message. I TO FU SHI MU RA This is where I am right now. Then the treasure is not in the toilet but somewhere in this village. Yes, you are right. It's a coincidence of Astronomical Probability. Come closer. Yes? I'll pardon you now. I'll help you find the buried treasure. What are you saying? It's a chance of life time. How can you say such a thing under this condition? That's why I can say so. Listen. Let villagers believe that I am the Goddess. Then, I can order villagers search buried treasure and and once they found it, they offer it to me. I'll do it, Ueda. For security purpose, let's decide code to communicate. Code? Listen and learn. First the message must be written horizontally in 4 letters. YA MA DA WA HI N NI YU U DA First the message must be written horizontally in 4 letters. YA MA DA WA HI N NI YU U DA And... YA MA DA WA HI N NI YU U DA We read this vertically from the left.

O GE RE RU HA NI! eh? eh? O GE RE RU HA... O RE HA NI GE RU ( I run away) I really heard something. I see. You asked Yamada to pretend to be the Goddess. We had done something terrible for her. I really understand how you feel about the village. But you picked the worst person for God. But we didn't know that she was that bad. We are trying to let Small-breasted Yamada-san run away. But before that, If she was discovered to be a fake, Most likely her life must be terminated. Professor, lend me your hand. Please. I beg you! From here, you shall step into Itofushi Mura If you need me, call me, please. Close the door. Watch it! Should you need anything.... There's no signal for cell phones!!! Why do we have to check old style toilets? But Anii, here, we can find such old toilets here. Then, God-004, come forward, please. Now you face showdown with the God-001.

He hid a goat at the back of the box. When he opens the front door, Goat will move with the back door. After showing that the box is empty, He closes the front door, His assistant puts the goat inside the box, and closes the back door. This way, the goat is inside the box. What are you saying? But this is really my Mary that vanished 3 months ago. Isn't it a fact that you stole this goat 3 months ago? For this purpose, on this day. What are you saying? Then, show us exactly what you'd done with the way I described. With opening and closing the doors, I had just said. You are so nasty! Can't you do it? Hey you! You are a goat thief? A goat thief is here for God? We must punish him. Hey you! Then, it is my turn. I will materialize what you imagine. To prove that it is not a trick, God-001, you help me. Me? Come here. Do you really mean it?! Look inside this canister. Why don't you check it by yourself? You check. Me? Yes. Do you see anything strange and unusual? No. Nothing in particular. Then, return it to me. Return it to me. I know. I was trying to put this lid firmly. There. Then, you go inside the box and stay there You are in the way. In the way?! You have no manners. Out of the way. You want me to be inside here, Right? That little boy! You, come here. In this tea cannister, If money is growing inside, Don't you feel it exciting? Sure Then, imagine that in your head. GUA PPA! (Means nothing) Open your eyes. Give me your hands. All for you. You had given all... but that's our coin bank. Money was inside, too. Sure. From distance, it looks like a Tea Canister. But it has a Money Slot. When God-001 was asked, if there was something unusual about this, he replied "No". A Coin Bank usually contains money. That's not unusual. But if you ask about it to God-001, He will say, money was inside. I don't think he comes back here. eh? God-001 is gone! He run away? He was a fake, after all. Let's look for him. We can't let him go from this village alive. We ran a lot, Muto. Yes, Master. That girl was so humiliating, Muto! Yes, Master. Muto! Check here. I do? Who else is here? Check it now! Big! So deep! He escaped! Find him! Who had done this? Maybe they were pushed from up there. Look there. Nensha Photography Real God punished them. By any chance... You did it? eh? In a way... OK. Ishiwara, arrest her. Yes! Yabe, why are you here? Excuse me? Do you know him? Not that I know of... I don't know him at all. Don't pretend that you don't know me. You are under arrest and charged with homicide. Why me? You just responded to "you did it?" with ahh mahh...in a way... Will you hold on a minute, detective? We are in the middle of examinations "Kami=Hair" "Kami=Paper" "Kami=God" To someone who wears toupee... Kami=God sounded like Kami=Hair. We are in the middle of examinations "Kami=Hair" "Kami=Paper" "Kami=God" To someone who wears toupee... Kami=God sounded like Kami=Hair. to eliminate fake Gods from the real one. "Kami=Hair" "Kami=Paper" "Kami=God" To someone who wears toupee... Kami=God sounded like Kami=Hair. We cannot let fake Gods go. "Kami=Hair" "Kami=Paper" "Kami=God" To someone who wears toupee... Kami=God sounded like Kami=Hair. We must find fake ones immediately "Kami=Hair" "Kami=Paper" "Kami=God" To someone who wears toupee... Kami=God sounded like Kami=Hair. and punish them. "Kami=Hair" "Kami=Paper" "Kami=God" To someone who wears toupee... Kami=God sounded like Kami=Hair. What's wrong with being Fake? "Kami=Hair" "Kami=Paper" "Kami=God" To someone who wears toupee... Kami=God sounded like Kami=Hair. What's wrong with being Fake? What did you say? Fake ones will have their efforts and sorrows. What do you think you know about these? You've convinced me totally. I ask for forgiveness. I'm sorry. What's up? Ueda-san! God-001 was murdered. Everyone thinks it was a punishment by God. Not possible. Probably the culprit is either one of two Gods: God-002 or God-003. Either one is killing competitors. So what it means is... We must get out of here immediately. How about the treasure? No time to talk about it. Not here. How about this way? Not here! How about over there? What are you doing? I found her! Finally I found you. What's the matter with you? Now you face showdown with the God-002. I put those detectives into hot springs. You know where the hot spring is. Not really... Then, ask someone here. ITO FUSHI MURA SHO-FU-KI KAN What are you doing? You have a wicked mind. I have an eye on my foot. Why there? God must check the world from the Heaven. Having an eye on foot is more convenient. I see. I hope it's not Oyaji Gag of Uonome or something. (Corn on the foot) Bunashi! (Means nothing) Entire foot is my eye. I will show you my powerful foot. Here, I have Ofuda Regular Humans use. Regular Trump Cards... I see. You call it that way. Look! There are no tricks. HEART, SPADE, DIAMOND, CLUB JOKERS, it has all. You know all about it, then. From here, you pick one Ofuda card you like. Then, put it into this envelop. You must not look at it. By X-Ray Eye on my foot, I will read your card. Yes, I can see it. I see it. QUEEN of HEART. Open this envelop now. Wait a minute. You said you would read the card in an envelop using your foot. You hid the envelope under your foot. When you picked it up, You replaced the envelop with the one you had already prepared. In that envelop, There was a card you already knew what it was. The QUEEN of HEART, that is. Where is the proof? Move your foot. There must be an envelop under your foot. Not that way. Lift it. Not that foot. Hey! It's so much bullshit I can hardly stand it. Why don't you show us something? You, detective, come over here. Excuse me... Pardon me... From this bag, you pick one card that you like. I can predict what you are going to pick. You must let me blindfold you. and you pick one card from here. Well, then, you pick one card from this bag. Take off your blindfold and look at the card. Eight Of Spade Eight Of Spade Hey... How did you do that? This? This vinyl bag has two bags. eh? Put a card right here. the card you want someone to pick must be placed here. Then, this card shall be picked accordingly. You see? Then, it's fraud, isn't it? I am the Goddess. Don't come close to me. Fake Kami! ( Hair=Kami God=Kami) is that person! Wait a minute. As a matter of fact, we all come to believe God-003 is the real God. Why? 003-sama had given us an advice. If someone shows up as God, just take a closer look at his or her hand. If his or her hand movement is too natural, he or she is not God. That's the proof of being a magician. I use foot, you know. I already know what you are. It's about time... you stop this nonsense act. You witnessed what had happened to God-001. He was a fraud... ...Con Man End of Story. I punished him. Punishment? But how? You claim you used Nenriki Psychic Power or something? Nenriki Will Power You claim you used Nenriki Psychic Power or something? Nenriki Will Power No. He just slipped from the cliff by coincidence. Nenriki Will Power No. He just slipped from the cliff by coincidence. God can only control the fate of humans. To control fate means to control probability. Thus, to cause coincidence from it. There are 10 Black Cards. There are 10 Red Cards. Shuffle well as many times as you like. I shall deal 10 cards to each player. Each player shows one card at a time face up on the table. The object of the game is, if color matches, We call it a pair and put them right here. If no match, We call it a wash and put them right here. And if these piles of "Pair" turns out that the number of black and the red happens to be equal, I win. If either color is more than others, You win. From any point of view, You have more advantages. Shall we play the game? Wash Black Pair Wash Red Pair Black Pair Wash Black Pair Wash Red Pair This is the last one. If both cards are red, I win. My Winning Probability shall be 1/4 (25%) Then... There's no tricks. Get out from the village immediately. Unless otherwise, I must punish you, too. By a natural cause of death from any point of view. You shall soon face death. Be the Goddess little bit longer. I'll come up with something, I promise. Watch it! You shall face death. Attention! What? What is it? Fire! Fire! Don't leave me here. eh ? Really?!? Fire! Alert villagers put out fire! What are you doing in the middle of the night? Are you OK? Are you injured? Wait a minute. Don't run away. Ueda-san! Have you read my message? eh? I carved codes on the Large Tree Trunk. Didn't you see it? That one... Ueda-san, you wrote it? Who else is here? I'm really at a loss... you abruptly told me... I felt a bit happy, of course. What are you saying? Ueda-san! You are good at mathematics, aren't you? The statement of Fermat's Last Theorem is about as simple as any mathematical proposition could be:The equation has no solution for non-zero integers x, y, and z if n is an integer greater than 2. Theorem A: If there is a solution (x, y, z, n) to the Fermat equation, then the elliptic curve defined by the equation is semistable but not modular. Theorem B: All semistable elliptic curves with rational coefficients are modular When I was 8 years old...

Theorem A: If there is a solution (x, y, z, n) to the Fermat equation, then the elliptic curve defined by the equation is semistable but not modular. Theorem B: All semistable elliptic curves with rational coefficients are modular I solved Fermat's Last Theorem.

Theorem A: If there is a solution (x, y, z, n) to the Fermat equation, then the elliptic curve defined by the equation is semistable but not modular.

Theorem B: All semistable elliptic curves with rational coefficients are modular Wash Black Pair Wash Red Pair Wash Black Pair Wait a moment Again the pair numbers are the same. Each shows cards like this If colors don't match, it's wash. Then, what it means is Wash Pile's red and black shall have the same number In short, Cards in this pile, the number of black and the number of red must be the same. I see. Soon you shall face death. That Goddamn fake God tricked me! He just hinted so that I get scared. Who set fire to the cottage? It was me. Huh? To save you, I set fire as diversion. That's too dangerous. I could've been burned to death. I have something to tell you. So I'm telling you that you shouldn't tell me abruptly. Have you prepared Shizurana? Antidote Flower eh? Shizurana I wrote it there. A I TA I ( I want to see you.) I MA KA RA. (Right now) SHI ZU RA NA (Shizurana flower) TE HA I ( Prepare ) Oh, I see. I got to read it horizontally. Yes, you are right. It had no valid meanings. Write it much better for easy understanding. You are acting strange. Where did 004 go? She was fake, after all. You are right. Found her! There she is! I feel I am melting... Yes, melting.... Are you really OK? What about it? These are ONI statues in this village... Crying ONI... there are two of them. Smiling ONI... there are three of them. I will put one into each box and give one to you. If you are real God, You can tell whether the ONI inside is a smiling one or crying one. You sit at the Left chair. You take the Middle chair. You sit at the Right chair. We shall regard the first one who answered correctly, as our God. Under one condition, however... Kanji of Doku (Poison) looks very similar to Kanji of Ichigo (strawberry) If the answer was incorrect, Kanji of Doku (Poison) looks very similar to Kanji of Ichigo (strawberry) we must use that strawberry Kanji of Doku (Poison) looks very similar to Kanji of Ichigo (strawberry) No, it's poison. Not strawberry. Kanji of Doku (Poison) looks very similar to Kanji of Ichigo (strawberry) No, it's poison. Not strawberry. If the answer was incorrect, Poison! Poison! If the answer was incorrect, Poison! Poison! take that Poison immediately. Then, tell us your answer. That's why I told you to prepare Shizurana. Antidote Flower Ueda-san? Where are you? From this stage, I can see that box over there. Then, what it means is that the person who sits here first can see what was put into the other person's box. Yes God-002 had seen yours and God-003's contents. God-003 knows the content of your box. You are the only one with no vital information. Then, there is no way to make a logical guess. That's why I told you to prepare Shizurana. So nobody knows anything, then? Then, three of you... must be considered fake. I got the answer. Wait a minute. The one in this box is well... eh... Smiling ONI Is that so? Well... Say Smiling ONI! Smiling... no... Crying... Which is it? It's a Smiling ONI. Well done. Now open your box. Smiling... ONI Correct. I knew it. She is the Goddess. He is running away. Follow him. Catch him. You get a bit wiser now. Your IQ must've been improved by associating with me. eh??? This is a very easy logic puzzle. God-002 knows the content of God-003 and 004. There are only 2 Crying ONIS. If your content and and God-003's content is Crying ONI. Then, God-002 will know immediately that his box contains Smiling ONI. However, He did not answer anything. Then, God-003's box and your box combination must be Smiling ONI - Crying ONI Crying ONI - Smiling ONI Smiling ONI - Smiling ONI However, if and only if your box contains Crying ONI, God-003 will know immediately that his box contains Smiling ONI. But again, he did not answer anything, either. Then, the logical explanation leads this conclusion. The content of your box is Smiling ONI. Do you understand? Yeah, sort of to me anyway. But do they really think it deep like that? In short, The number of Smiling ONI is more than others. Thus, the probability of Smiling Oni was much higher. No way to depend upon such an easy guess. But yet, if nobody answers, They would have killed us all. But now we can say that the treasure is all ours. Oh, yeah. Turtle! The God of Turtle... That's the Shintai object believed to contain the spirit of a deity. A turtle starts to move... does it mean this rock moves? No way. Turtle head... So huge... Trouble! Trouble!! Trouble!!! Trouble!! Trouble! Them, too... have you done it? Now you move to the next test. Still more? A catastrophe is coming closer! Village will be vanished soon. Kikuhime-san, No worry any more. If she is real, she will stop the catastrophe. You are not the Goddess, far from it. You are exactly opposite to it. Don't be wise. According to the legend, 300 years ago, God had performed Nensha Photography. In fact, those 3 fake Gods, had strange patterns on their foreheads. Paisley... Paisley? Paisley?! You transfer this pattern somewhere in the village... By tomorrow morning... This is the last test. Paisley... If she can't perform Nensha photography Her life must end tomorrow. I feel a bit sorry for her. Such a young age... Turtle! The God of Turtle... U I YA YA E TE MA TSU DA RU DA HO KI KA A What is she saying? Some kind of prayers? KA NO SHI KA GO KA NO TA KO DA Where did she come from? DA YU KA I KA N SO KI JI NO FU TA GI I have no idea what she is saying. SU TE YA NO A MA RO U TO KA RU NO NU RE TA RU RU O BI ZU A RI NI ZU What if ... she is trying to tell something to her allies outside. That pattern is so complicated. It's impossible to tell exactly by words. U KA WA E RE RI DA TSU. KA WO..... I'm counting on you, Ueda! Watch your step. This way, please. Ah... Mayor. You are really the Goddess. Please excuse our behavior toward you. Raise your head. She vanished! Here, Right here!! Then, I shall give you the voice of the Goddess. There is no need to worry about a catastrophe. I will definitely get rid of it. But there is one condition you must follow. I know there is a treasure in this village. Surrender it to me. What did she say? Help! Help!! Help! What's the matter? We encountered... With the real God. Wait. She is the real the Goddess. She is just an unknown magician. I asked her to pretend to be the Goddess. I'm sorry. Even if there is a fake God, if your worries were saved... So where is the real God? At Shiranuji. The one who lives there for more than 300 years is the real God. God talks to our heart without using words. Just a moment. Nensha the ability to project images onto paper, photographs,etc. with the mind. She performed Nensha photography. Nensha the ability to project images onto paper, photographs,etc. with the mind. Nensha the ability to project images onto paper, photographs,etc. with the mind. It may be this person had helped her. Ueda! I saw him by coincidence. He was tying thread around the neck of the turtle. Turtle head? I see what he had done. She rolled threads around the neck of the turtle in the hut. She has copied my pattern there. And her ally outside received the thread. and he used this turtle's neck to reproduce the pattern. And... Paisley... Your wrong doing using the Principle of FAX, Seibai Famous Kill line or the phrase from Abarenbo Shogun Seibai=Punishment cannot be ignored.

Are you really OK?? Yabe-san! Hey you, What do you want? Help me. Don't come here. I beg you. She should be around here. Hello, everyone. With me, Yabe of the Metropolitan Police Department... They are not detectives. They were checking toilet bowls without getting any permissions. They must be allies of this girl. They are searching for the village treasure. That's misunderstanding. Then, why? Why were you checking toilet? Well, that was the order from the top... Don't they know the time to give up? I got it. If you insist, I will surrender him to you. You can boil him, grill him, whatever you want. Can I wear something? Everyone, thank you for your Mountain Hunt. From now, we shall commence searching God-004. Running away from the problems only guarantees a whole new set of problems! I saw through your diabolical plot. Through and through!! Nobody is around me... to pay attention to my speech... Ueda-san, I vow to fight through the problems. Thanks to kind cooperation of Itofushi Women's Association, We have lunch boxes for all of you. Every group leader should come to Cable TV Station.

SORE DE MOTSUTE KIGAMUITARA UEDA SAN WO TASUKE NI IKIMASU. DE MO AMARI KITAI SHINAIDE KUDASAI. IMA MADE NO KOTO ZENBU GOMEN NA SAI You came here just as I had expected. You are... Surprised? I am the Goddess. How old are you? It's not true that you've been living here for 300 years. Why are you hiding here? I am not just hiding. The Sun sets 27 minutes later. Then, I go outside secretly. In the day time, I stay in the darkness just counting numbers. Why? I must do it as I am the Goddess. This village will vanish soon. Do you know something? Then, I will give you a hint. You saved me in the woods. Pick one and remember it. Secretly...so that I don't know what it is. Now I show you 3 Ofudas at a time, Onne-san. You confirm only in heart whether you see the Ofuda you remembered. You could not find your Ofuda anywhere. It is natural as each Ofuda has different figure. But I am capable of finding Onee-san's Ofuda. This one? No tricks at all. Just because I am the Goddess, I know what you had remembered. I told you not to come here. You, two... That little girl is... our child. Her name is Kotomi. Why are you keeping her here? That girl was not supposed to exist. eh? We were born in this village. So we were together all along. As a result, she became pregnant. As a village custom, we asked Kikuhime-san to tell us about our child's future. Then... You must not bear this child. This child brings a catastrophic disaster to the village without fail. This village has been performing marriage within the village for a long time. So the possibility is very high... we might be siblings. But she insisted on having a baby. So we raised our child secretly right here. The Goddess must not leave from here. If you leave this place, your body will be soiled. But we really wanted to make villagers acknowledge this child. So we made Kotomi the Goddess. From the beginning, we planned to use you. We placed a threatening letter in your apartment. Don't go to Itofushi Mura Village. You shall be killed by the Turtle. We placed a threatening letter in your apartment. Don't go to Itofushi Mura Village. You shall be killed by the Turtle. This way, you can get rid of all fake Gods gathered in the village. 3 fake Gods were killed by myself and Kanzaki. Muto, you are very cute. Yo! When you meet someone in the mountain, we must say Hello. You see? He..help! Muto!! And lastly if you vanished... Don't worry. You helped us this far... We don't even think of killing you... Behind this place, you can find a secret path. You shall reach Kisa Mura Village, 10 km away from here. You do not come back to this village. This is the village treasure. I'll give it to you. Our family's task was to keep this treasure. We killed Usui-san, who was trying to find this treasure. But we don't need it any more. Why? Our real treasure is Kotomi, our child only. You take that treasure with you. You escape from this village with the treasure. If sold, you'll get several million yen. What's your problem? Do you have anything you must value other than this treasure? I don't need it. I have something I must cherish. What is it? What is your valuable thing? Kotomi! Go back. You must not come here. Outside world... you have something you must keep other than the treasure. Kotomi! Onee-chan! Onee-chan! Kotomi! Come back. Kotomi! Maguai! Maguai! Oh... I lost. Excuse me? What do you want? What do you think? Like Bull's?! Wait! Wait up! You, with Big Penis! Hold it! Wait. Wait big one! Wait! Wait. Wait big one! Wait, I say. Wait. Wait big one! Wait. Wait big one! Wait!! Get him!! Ueda-san! You are... By any chance... I am the Goddess. No way. This small kid is not the Goddess. Kotomi! Kotomi!! Kotomi? What do you mean? You... this child is... Yes. This is our child you ordered us to kill 10 years ago. This child must die. If she lives, a catastrophic disaster will come to the village. Kikuhime-san! Evil spirits, Vanish with this!!! Stop it! Father! Father!! Koto... Kotomi... Why...you had done such a thing... A Catastrophe is coming. You are all doomed. >Are you telling the truth? We were wrong. What do you think she can do? What do you think she can do?! Too late. You all die. You'll know it soon. We can't let this child live. Village should vanish. Wait! Look! Woods are on fire! Okaa-san! Okaa-san! Mother! Our village is finished. So this is the catastrophe... You caused all of this. You cursed the real God. Wait! Mother! I came to deliver Ofudas you ordered. You, by any chance... Yamada Sensei? Why mountains are on fire? She is a well known Shodo Calligrapher. Just for our last defense, I have ordered Ofudas via Internet. Mayor! What are you saying? They are useless. Look at the mountains. Calm down. From the ancient times, it is said that the character has mysterious power. And it has ability to stop catastrophe, too. Just one character... It means "Fire"="Hi" If you get two of this, you get "Flame"="Honou" Three will become "Blaze"="Kaen" And if we add water... Flame will become dim... If we add more water,... it becomes " Fresh Water"="Tansui" Now it has nothing to do with fire. That is... one and only way to stop fire is... to add water... add more water,... and add much more water. That's all there is to it. We all know it... even you don't have to tell us. Then, why not rush to add water!! Put out the fire now! Put out the fire! Prove you are a man. Go! Mother? It happens that there was a good size order ... so I came here. But you... I'm sorry. Excuse my saying so... but mother, please don't scold her so much. I will tell Naoko-san firmly later. Besides this is not the first time I got involved in her selfishness. I must apologize to Ueda Sensei. She has been giving you trouble all the time. No. Don't even mention it. Mother. Don't call her Mother. With that pace of fire, this place is also in danger. But do you think this is the real catastrophe Kotomi-chan was talking about? Besides a turtle shall be moving... What does it mean? Turtle? Anii... Fire smokes! Villagers might burn us alive?! So we are now smoked salmon, aren't we? Help! Help! Kotomi-chan was feeling something right here. Oh, yes. Kotomi-chan told me that this was a hint. This? Give it to me. Time piece... Eh? There's no time piece around here. But she knew what time it was precisely. The sun sets 27 minutes later. She might have had the ability to know the length of time. I heard something like that before. It's just like "Perfect Pitch" Time Version. One minute, one hour or one day... Without the use of a time piece, They can tell the length of time accurately. Just like me. Probably Sensei is correct. With that, we can now explain why she knew what card you had remembered. Look. From here, you remember one Ofuda. And then, she showed you 3 Ofudas as a unit. And you must check if you could find Ofuda you remembered is inside the bundle. At that time, she was watching your eyes. She was checking how long it took for you to say NO. In the bunch where similar figure was included, Your reaction to say NO takes a bit longer. You are right, Mother. You already knew it, Sensei, from the beginning. Yes, of course. Mother. You are lying. In addition, don't call her Mother. Naoko! But what's her ability got to do with the turtle? Hold right there. This sound... The pitch is getting faster, isn't it? Hey! Open this gate!! Aniki, fire is getting closer. Very closer. Mother, you shouldn't overdo it. I'm sorry I should've known... From here on, you two should go alone. eh? You know, that this is not the time. Look at the character "Person" A person must lean against each other. If a child is born, it becomes a Big as family. If you are capable, A Dog can be adopted. If you are more capable, you eat a lot... You become Fat. See? Mother! I understand all. Leave everything up to us. Naoko... We'll be going now. What did you understand about? Someone, do something, will you please?! We're gonna die... Burning everywhere... Ueda-san... The sound we heard at the cave is coming from here. 300 years ago, this village experienced Flush Flood. And the village sunk under water. Dam... River... Underwater... Possibly river water is accumulating gradually in the underground reservoir. Thus, it causes flush flood when it reaches the max capacity. This turtle look-alike rock is a lid to the underwater. That girl had noticed the Pitch Interval of Sound has been reducing gradually. When the turtle moves, A Catastrophe comes to the village. Then, sooner or later, This will pop out?! Anyhow, we must leave this place. Hey, You! Ueda-san... We just remove this turtle from this place. Eh? This is a lid, isn't it? We can put out the fire with this water. I see. A Simple Lever can be applied. The distance from the Effort End to the Fulcrum is X The distance from the Load End to the Fulcrum is Y The needed Power E to move this turtle is... Ueda!
