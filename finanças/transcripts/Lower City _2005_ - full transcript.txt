"LOWER CITY" Let me say goodbye to you. - Have a nice trip. - Thanks. - Bye, good luck. - Thanks, same to you. - How much? - $2.20. You know of any trucks heading for Salvador? One just left. Looking for a ride, babe? - You going by truck? - Boat. Mr. Marquinho, it was a pleasure. - Take care. - See you next time. - You headed for Salvador? - Yeah. Maybe I could catch a ride with you. - And do we get it? - What do you mean? You know... - For 50 bucks, you do. - The works? $50 just for the basics. What about $30 plus the ride? - $40. - Forty's phat, right? $40 for both of us. That's what I'm saying, for both. - What's up, man? - I'm cool. Let's do it. I'm up. Make yourself at home. Excuse me. What's the score? - Vitória wins by one. - Great. Take the helm. You moan like hell. You howl like an ambulance. And you're the werewolf with the little meat. Go for it! You gonna hang out a while in Salvador? Yeah, maybe I'll grab myself a gringo. - You're not from around here? - No, from Vitória. - Vitória up north? - Vitória down south. No way! Phat! You know the place? He doesn't know shit. He's never been out of the State. Hold this for me. Gimme the cigarette. Hold it straight. Got $100 says he'll drop in 12! $100 says he drops in 40! - That white rooster is a killer! - Go, my rooster! Come on, Whitey! Come on, Whitey! Give him hell! Fuck, give him hell! I'm paying $20 to $10, you motherfuckers! Come on, you bunch of sorry asses! - Come on, Whitey! - $40 to $10, you bunch of chickens! What the fuck is wrong with that asshole?! I'm paying $40 to $10! Come on, motherfuckers! Hey, brother, you with the big head! Relax. Hey, you big head! $40 to $10 my ass! I'm paying $100 flat in the Whitey! What the hell! You crazy? That fool got $100 on the white chicken. I got $100 on the Black Cock! I'm going to make soup out of your chicken! Come on! Kill it! - Come on, Whitey! - Come on! Come on! Come on! And I'm taking $100 from that sucker! Come on! Come, Whitey! What the fuck?! Come on! Come on! Alright, pay up! Fuck, my rooster had it in the bag! - In the bag, your ass! - Fucking ninja rooster. - You crazy? - Whitey is a samurai, brother. You ask me, that Black Cock was doped up. If I'd known he was doped up... That fucking cock was doped up! He's offering me a ride to Salvador. - What? - I think I'll take it. I'll get there faster by truck. - Check this out, Deco. - What's wrong, babe? See you around sometime. Where are you going? Gimme a shot of rum. Hey, you! You up for a rematch? No thanks, brother. We're cool. You're his husband, or just his boyfriend? - What's wrong with you? - Hey, man, chill out, you hear? You won your bet, and now you're fucking with us? Just joking. Stop fucking with us, man! I don't know you. Do I know you? Relax, man. Just messing around. Let's drink. Care for a drink? Hey, nigger, I'm paying for it with your money! Then we'll bet again. Come on, let's drink. Why are you sad? You're alive. It's the rooster that's dead. Come on, nigger, relax! Come on, bottoms up, darkie! That's a good one, bottoms up! - Let's drink, nigger... - What the fuck is wrong with you? - What...? - What's your problem, brother? Back off, man. Don't push my brother. Don't push my brother. You're fucking with us, so chill out... Go sleep it off, man. Can you believe this shit? I'll kick this fool's ass! Chill out, man. Come on, let's split this dive. Can we have our bill? The bill! I got $50 on the white rooster. What the hell you looking at? Think I'm pretty? I don't want any fucking nigger staring at me! Fuck off, motherfucker! Relax, man. Let's go, brother. How much do we owe here? - Let get out of here. - Fucking nigger! Come on, Naldinho! We're almost there. Sit down. I'm going to cast off the boat. - I'm losing it. - Sit there. - I'm right here, my brother. - I'm fucking bleeding! Easy, easy! Help me untie the boat. - Let's go, babe. - Hold him right there! - Come on, you gonna stay? - Wait a second! Help me! Easy! Help, for Christ's sake. I'm bleeding like hell. Easy, we're almost there. - Fucking hole in my stomach! - Calm down. Hold my hand. Come on, Deco, get me out of here. I don't want to die here! Relax, just hold my hand. Don't let go of my hand. Just breathe. Marinalva! Marinalva! Wait a second! It's Naldinho, Marinalva, he's fucked up, open up! If he's fucked up, why don't you take him to the hospital? We got into a fight in Cachoeira. I killed-- Open the goddamn door! I don't want to get involved. Marinalva! For Christ's sake, open up! Grab him by the legs! Come on. Watch his head. The leg. The leg! Take care of him, while I call a doctor. So...? Speak up, man! An inch to the side, and he'd have been a goner. I'll settle the rest with you next week... - Thanks. - You think I am Mother Tereza? Dois Mundos! - What's up, champ? - I'm cool, brother. - You checking out the market? - You got it. Hey, my friend, you know of any cargo jobs? Business is slow. I was just telling her. But if anything shows up, I'll let you know. Phat. Dois Mundos, I need a little up front. Can you help me out? An advance? With business slow like this? But I do have a little job on the side, know what I mean? Brand new piece, never been fired... but you only get paid after the job. No, Dois Mundos, I'll pass. I'm clean now. So now you're Mr. Pussy? Here's the sucker. Fool! The little nigger making like a heavyweight. She split this afternoon. Gone. Left some food for us. She must not have enjoyed your slapping her monkey last night. What the hell, brother! You fucked the girl, man. You two didn't even wait for me to get better! - Hey, you find any action? - No, nothing, zero. Marinalva came around this morning for the rent money on the room. Tell her to look for it up her fat ass. Shit! Marinalva has a huge ass! Sorry-ass piece of huge ass! - Hey, Franciel! - What's up, Deco? Baldy! - Where you been? - You know, here and there. Looking for work, you know of anything? I need somebody to spar with Franciel. You up for it? Stop by to talk it over. Right! Peace! You won't drink. Are you crazy? You're on antibiotics. What's wrong, Deco? You pissed 'cause of her? You mad, Naldinho? Dig it, Rufino. Deco's in love with a whore. How touching... Piss off, Rufino, I didn't ask for your opinion. Hey, Fua, he's pissed 'cause the "ho" split on him. He's lucky. I had it worse with Michele up in Belém do Pará. I started sniffing and feeling her up... and look at the size of the cock I found! We used to hang out here when we were kids. It was phat. Deco used to eye the dames, taking their brats swimming. When they weren't looking, I'd grab their stuff, right, Deco? We'd split up that street over there. Shit, we only got caught once, right? 'Cause you were sleeping on your feet. Sleeping on my feet? Dig, bro, just standing there like a fool. You are always showing off. I wasn't sleeping on my goddamn feet. Just standing there like an mummy, bro. Hey? Hold this. So many pothead bitches fucking for free, the gringos... don't come around anymore. We have to go "door-to-door". - Where do you know them from? - He'd be my cousin. And him? He's... the son of my aunt's cleaning lady. You take the girls back and forth from the ships, and get 5 per cent. 5 per cent? Ten... five for each. And you can pick up some action on the side. And you cover for gas, right? Right, she covers the gas. Good evening. So? How much? - 40 dollar. - 40 dollar. 40 dollar too much, too much! No, no, no, good price, 40 dollar. Too much money, "muchachas", 20 dollar. Look, "muchacho". 20 dollar, only blow job. 30, all included. Okay, "muchacho". Deal, 30 dollar. Come here. Go there. Can you see from there? Help! Holy shit! Look, man! Holy fuck! What is this, man? What the fuck? Karina! What's going on? Hey, man, we need a doctor. A doctor, understand...? Get on the radio, man. Go call a fucking doctor! Take it easy! No fucking cops on board, you hear? Shit, man, the woman's dying! Get a fucking doctor, man! The woman's dying, and you're pissing around! Here, take her to the hospital! What the fuck? Did I ask you for money? Did I ask you for money? Just call a fucking doctor! Don't take this shit! Help! Help! You gonna let the girl die here, is that it? Help! I'll beat the shit out of that white-ass gringo. Easy! Take it! That's all I've got! Call somebody there, Jamily. Karina! The drinks are on me. He's buying for me. Hey, the man's buying, he's got money! 150 dollars! That fucking fool! For a while I thought you were really having an attack. I just felt sorry for that little whitey, shaking like a leaf. That sorry-ass Captain was worse... Fuck! All he could say was "Mira, muchacho"! "Mira, muchacho" must be that fool's mother. "Mira, muchacho"! Wait! Come on! Come on! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it! Go take a breather. What's wrong with you, Deco? Next week there's a tournament in Muritiba. If you want, I can arrange a fight for you. 50-50. Thanks. Hey, you leaving? - Right. - So early? In just five minutes... a super-sexy number by Brenda, the princess of Xanadoo. Got a smoke? Thanks. What's up, babe? What's up? I'll have a Cuba Libre, please. When you gonna ditch that sucker? What's it to you? So we make a little love, nice and wet. Hanging with you two is just for fun, but I've got bills to pay. The usual trick is $37. If you want something sexier... - Sexier...? - Yeah. - How much is the sexier? - $60. $60. Let's do it. Want to turn off the light? Hey, brother. I was gonna call you, but you were out cold. So I let you sleep. Dois Mundos came around earlier. Says he's got some cargo for us to take to Cachoeira. Cachoeira? If you're waiting for Karina, she's gonna be a while. The fat john is a VIP. Pays good, but it takes him an hour just to get it up. Dois Mundos says there's somebody making an offer on the boat. We sell the boat for shit, and then what? They're hiring the sailors back to work for them. We do all the hard work, and they sit back on their asses sipping scotch. Okay, brother. I hear what you're saying. Seriously, Deco... you're my main man. My respect for you is worth more than a piece of pussy. Hell, brother... and my respect for you is worth more than all the pussy in the world. You know? Show me a huge piece of pussy... and I'd take your friendship any day. Come here. Let me give you a kiss. - Wait. - Come here. - No way, what hell...! - Come on, man. - Fuck, man! - Come here! What the fuck?! You're my main man, bro. You know that. Hi. Aren't you gonna offer me a drink? Serve one up, Fua. Thanks. You pissed at me? Pissed about what? Beats me. You never came back to see me at the club. I have no business there. Where you been, bro? Around. - Hey, Naldinho. - Just getting a trim. Hey, Dois Mundos, let's take care of some business, brother. Sit up. - How old are you? - Twenty. - Job? - Dancer. Address? I'm moving, no address right now. When was your last period? You know you're pregnant, don't you? You can get dressed now. I want to come back here and find the engine running. If you're not here waiting for me, I'll come after you, hear? You think I'm gonna run, brother? Go with the Lord, man. The car will be running when you get here! Hey, man, gimme some of that headache medicine. $3.50. - What, man? - The medicine, it's $3.50. You're short. - Short what, man? - You gave me $2.30. Come on, freak, open the door, don't look at me. - Open the fucking door. - Wait! - Open the door! - Are you crazy? Don't look me in the face! - I need the key. - What key, boy? Open the door... The key to open the door! Open the fucking thing, nice and slow... Come on. Come on. Don't look at me. Take it easy! Grab the money. Don't look me in the face. What the hell is this? Business been slow. Business slow my ass! I saw a dame leaving here full of medicine. - Gimme the money! - She paid with a credit card, man. Boy, I'm going to blast your mother-fucking face! I swear to God, she paid on credit. Don't bullshit me, I came here for the goddamn money, and I want it now! Shit, brother. Relax, brother, you get hit? Let me go. What the fuck, fool, clean yourself up. Let me go. Relax, brother. Look at me, relax! Look at me. You alone here? I'm all alone, man. Edvan, relax, brother, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? - It was an accident. Calm down. - What do you want? You got that shit the old granddaddies have been taking? What? That pill they take to get it up. Don't look at me. Get the pills! Easy! Which one do you want? Take it easy, friend. Gimme the most expensive shit you got, stuff it my backpack! I'm helping you! Take it easy! Easy! Damn! Stuff that shit in my backpack. Got two great products, one for balding, and another for losing weight. I'm not asking you anything, just put what I told you in the bag! It's worth $100 a box, man! - One box? - Sure, man. So fill up the bag, move it! Stuff it all in there! Sit down! Sit down! Sit the fuck down! Piss-pants! What the hell is this? That's what I'm asking you, what the fuck? Belongs to Dois Mundos. What do you want this piece for, Naldinho? Brother, this shit is fucked up! I'm gonna do a number on a drugstore. Dois Mundos has the place staked out. No cops, nothing. Give it to me! - I'm giving this shit back. - No way, brother. - Not until I do the next drugstore. - I sure am. Gimme the piece, brother. Gimme the fucking piece! - You're not my father. Give it to me! - No! Gimme the piece! Let go, brother! Fucking shit! - Sorry, man. - Sorry for what, man? You want to get messed up, go ahead, fool. But you do it on your own! It's over for me, man! History! Let's have a round of applause for Karina, our blonde volcano! Here it is. In a few minutes, another number by Sirlene... our delicious black panther. Wanna go upstairs? Not now, babe. I'm paying tonight. Come on. No, don't take it off. Don't do it. I've been thinking... I got some new action.. I wanna take you out of here. Action? I pulled off a job... we can sell the stuff and chill for a while. What job? Some medicine shit. You know? I'm like Santa Claus for all the limp dicks. Gimme that. Blonde. Hot. What about the boat? We're gonna sell it. I'd rather leave everything as it is. Why? Because of everything. Because of him? What do you want? - I don't know. - You have to decide. I don't know. I can't stay away from neither of you. You have to know! Get out! Get the fuck out of here! I came here to talk. We can go for a walk. I'm working out. So stop by the club for a beer. I'm splitting tomorrow. So I'll wait for you over there and we'll talk after you work out. Don't be upset. I hate to see you and Naldinho fighting. Me and Naldinho have known each other since we were little. We're not crazy to fight over a bitch. For me, you're past. I don't want anybody's warmed-over leftovers. Chill, you and your little boyfriend. I'm tired of sorry-ass fools that don't give me a thing, and think they rule. Get the fuck out of here. Before I smash you in the face. Out! In some minutes, Jamily, the sexy shorty. Hey, chubby, what's your name? Marcelo. Marcel in ho. Come here, buy me a drink. Today's my birthday. Help yourself. Get lost, girl, go dance on your own turf. Hey, Karina, you okay? Fine. Beautiful. Please, hit me. Please... please... please... They didn't find any gunpowder on your hands, only on the gringo's. But you're in deep shit. There was coke in the cabin. So we'll be calling you back for more questions. She's in really deep shit. Am I free to go now? Sure, you can go. Your bail was paid. - Who? - What do you mean, who? Who paid my bail? Valmir Gonçalves dos Santos. Valmir? I heard what happened to you. That's some tough shit. Cops are fucked up. You alright? I just wanna split here. Where to? Anywhere. The precinct captain's got the heat on me here. I'm living in a little flat Dois Mundos lent me. - Phat. - Phat. A suite. You could move in with me. Better not. Come move in with me! Look at the man who's asking you to move in with him. Come on. I'm pregnant. Pregnant? Pregnant? Phat. Phat. Move in with me. I'll take care of you. Karina. Got another fight for you, day after tomorrow. It's a kid, son of a hardware store owner from around here. Important. - What's my cut? - $400. You can hit him all you want until the third round, but then... you have to take a dive. Don't get me wrong, but I think I'll pass. You keep 500, and I'll take the rest. Then we'll get another fight here. Don't be a prick, Deco! You're not a kid anymore. I'll fix the fight. Dois Mundos lent me all this. I'm going to pay him back. Make yourself at home, it's free. The bed's beautiful. All white. Does it still hurt? No. What about here? It doesn't hurt any more, it's all better. What about here? - Yeah, there it hurts. - Really? It hurts? Hurts like hell. Get up! Get up! Come on, man! Go for it! I picked up two more fights for you. Saturday in Arapiraca, and Sunday in Maceió. Fua, if you'd gone to school, you wouldn't cook like this. That's all there is, slop-of-the-day, the special. - Want some more? - What's up? - Hey. Pour it on. - More? You disappeared? Here I am, man, what's up? I need to have a word with you. Later, brother. - You know who's been around? - No. Your main man, the boxer. He came to me wanting to sell the boat, make business. Just telling you 'cause you're cool. If I were you, I'd go there. Right, fellas? Hey, Fua! - Gimme a beer. - And a glass. I stopped by the club to see you, and they said you were here. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm thinking of selling the boat, and I thought we could... Better not. Why? You'd end up killing each other. I'm pregnant. - I could... - I'm splitting. Is that what you want? In just a few minutes, the hot shorty. - Sirlene? - What? The girls were saying you're heading up North, right? Day after tomorrow I'm catching a ride on a truck to Maranhão. They say a blow job is worth a gold nugget up there. - A what? - A little gold pebble. I was thinking of heading North myself. Maybe I could go with you. I've had it with those two. They're gonna end up in a mess. Karina? Zilu told me. - About what? - The baby. How long? A month, tops. Stop around tomorrow and I'll get you some pills, okay? Phat. Dois Mundos, what's up? I came by to have a word with you. Wait a second, brother, can't you see I'm eating? Man, I'm splitting this week... and I just stopped by to pick up that money of mine. What money? - From the medicine, Dois Mundos. - That's the rent on the apartment. Brother, if you pay me what you owe me... I'll pay you the rent, Dois Mundos. You trying to rip me off, brother? - It's her. - She's what, man? It's her. Go fuck yourself, Dois Mundos. What do you mean, it's her? You dissing me? - What the fuck is wrong? - Brother, you sleeping on your feet? He doesn't even have to keep his eye on the babe. - Somebody else already does. - What's your point, brother? She was hanging out with the boxer, real tight... I'm gonna blast you, motherfucker! Don't mess with me, Dois Mundos! Let go of me! What's wrong, man? What the fuck, Dois Mundos? Even you? The man's just telling you, 'cause he's your brother, man. What the hell, brother? Even you? Go check it out, man! Go check it out! Why'd you do it, brother? I didn't do nothing, my brother. - She's expecting my child, Deco. - Your child my ass! Fuck off! Sit down. Sit down!
