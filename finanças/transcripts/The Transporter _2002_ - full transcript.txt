Go, go, go, go, go! Move it, move it. Move it! Let's go. - Move, move! - In the car. Let's go. Let's go. There's four of you. You can count. I'm impressed. Now drive! Rule one. Never change the deal. The deal was transportation... for three men with a combined weight of 254 kilos. Yeah, well this is a new deal. An extra 80 kilos means... we will not make your destination on the gas I have allotted. So, we'll stop and get more gas. Every stop we make exposes us. Every exposure increases the risk of getting caught. An extra 80 kilos means the Kony shock absorbers I installed... for this job will not give us the ability... to outmaneuver any police that might be chasing us. Which means if there is a chase, we lose our advantage. Which also increases the possibility of getting caught. I don't want to get caught. You don't want to get caught. Just drive the car, man, or you're gonna catch a bullet to the brains. And who's going to drive? Shoot this asshole! I'll drive. Not without the ignition code, you won't. Three men. 254 kilos. That was the deal. Three men. 254 kilos. Seat belts. Shit! Sh... shit! See what I mean about the shocks. Now it's time. - Look out! - Careful! Get out of the way! One way, one way! Look out, man! Look out! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoo-hoo! Yes! - Yeah! - Yes! Go, go, go! No... Shit! - Aargh... - No, no, no! If you don't mind, I just conditioned the leather back there. Take us to the drop point. Not yet. Hello. - The cops! The cops! - The cops now! What are you doing? Don't stop now. - Do something. - Come on, do something. - What are you thinking? - What are we doing now? Don't even think it, man. No, nooooo!! Don't do this. - No! No! - No, no, no, no, no! Your gun, please. - You gave me too much. - I need you to take us to Avignon. The deal was this far, no further. The deal is the deal. Rule number one. Rules are meant to be broken. Not mine. Let's go. Get in the car. Come one, hurry! Move it! ...really I did. Oh yeah, well, how come you don't have your yellow card with you? Well, I, I... must've left it back in Nam on the base. Yeah, they all say that. "Left it back in Nam on the base." Uh-huh. Let me show you what we do to people who left it... back in Nam on the base. Oh, no. Please let go of me! Where are you taking me? You gotta be punished for not carrying your shot record... on you. It's a fate far worse than death. Oh, hell, no... ...the Argentinian government" reaffirmed its commitment... to meeting the IMF started this year. And yesterday in Nice four men robbed... the Alliance Investment Corporation. One man died on the sidewalk. The others were apprehended early this morning... when they took a wrong turn on a one-way street in Avignon... and ran into a taxi cab. The police said, were it not for the poor driving habits, the 20 million euros in bearer bonds would have been cashed... and gone by this afternoon. And in other news, the stock market closed... I always say the way a man treats his car is how he treats himself. I'd say that's probably true, Inspector. You have a good sense of humor for a foreigner, Monsieur Frank. Like the French, sly wit. Just the right amount of flavor. Been out driving? Until they pass a law, says I can't. Do you want to come in for a coffee? Thank you, but I have a lot of stops to make. 88 to be exact. That's a lot of stops. A lot of 1999 black BMW 735s... with 0-6 on their license plates to check out. Ah, it's a very popular car with a certain type down here. You've seen them. They come over from Italy in those very expensive suits, and the young pretty girls with the big jewelry... and too much make-up. Very... Mafia. There was a robbery. A getaway. Some very fancy driving. By someone in a 1999 black BMW 735? Yeah, with 0-6 on the plate. You have been in the city lately? Not for a while. I love Nice. The food. The way they grill fish. No place else in France does it the way they do in Nice. And the women. I prefer the women there. They are more complicated than the local variety, don't you think? I don't particularly like complicated. You like to keep it simple. Why are you so interested? Oh, you know... uh, ever since I'm a little boy, military people have always intrigued me. I'm ex-military. I'm an ex-little boy. Sure you don't have time for a coffee? Everything is always so neat with you, Monsieur Frank. Nothing ever out of place. I take that as a compliment, coming from a man who pays attention to every detail. Maybe I'll come back later for that coffee. Door's always open to you. Lupo gave me your number. Be brief. I'm looking for a transporter. I'm listening. One bag. That's it. Dimensions? Be specific. 1 meter 50 by half a meter. Weight? 50 kilos. Not more. Destination? 24 Rue de Luxembourg. You're delivering to Mr... Rule two. No names. Time of pickup? 7 o'clock in the morning. At the front door. A package. 1 meter 50 by 50. 50 kilos. 250 kilometers. Traveling within the speed limit. One stop for refreshments. 40,000. Half now, half on delivery. Delivery will be at noon. If no one is there, it is not my responsibility. I'll leave the package. Once we make a deal, the terms of that deal cannot be changed or renegotiated. Another rule? It's rule number one. Do we have a deal? You're very precise. Transportation is a precise business. Flat. Hi. Now, don't move. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just gonna make a hole so you can drink. That's all I'm gonna do. Please. Please! Please, come on. Come on, drink. Slowly. OK, OK, that's enough. Good girl. I'm going to take the tape off. If you scream, I'll have to kill you. Understand? I have to pee. You want me to do it in your car? OK. I'm gonna take my knife now, so don't scream, OK? It's to cut you free. You don't need your mouth to pee. You have one minute. Fifty-five, fifty-four, fifty-three, fifty-two, Breaking the rules, Frank. Not good to break the rules. Fifteen. Seven... two... Time's up. Don't make me drag you out. Shit! No, please, no. Rule three. Never look in the package. Hope you enjoyed your pee, 'cause it's your last on this trip. You see what comes of breaking the rules? Jerk! You're late. Ran into a little problem. Nothing serious? Nothing serious. You open the package? Rule three. Never open the package. I like that. Rules. You can't get anything done in a world without rules. You're a foreigner, right? It's a nice little thing you've got going for yourself here. High class. Good reputation. I didn't get your name. Rule two. No names. Of course. You don't count it. Why? Should I? No. No. That concludes the deal. You know, I was wondering, if you wouldn't mind transporting something for me. That's what you do, right? You deliver, no questions asked. Why not? Weight? Maybe a kilo. Destination? Grenoble. 306 Rue Du Lac. A Mr... Oh, right. I forgot. Rule two. I like him. What the f...?! Where is he? You're like dog shit. You're everywhere. Yeah, I know. I know you wanna pee. All you wanna do is pee. Shit. Frank, you stupid shit. I ask the questions. You answer the questions. No long speeches. Just keep it simple. Got it? Who are you? My name is Lai. I come from Ch... I ask the questions. You answer the questions. Nothing more, nothing less. Do you wanna try again? What kind of shit am I in? Deep shit. Very deep shit. Those guys... Sorry, sorry, I won't say anyth... Bon app√©tit. Where are you going? To bed. I can't think straight when I'm tired. A good night's sleep, I always see things better. Can I leave? Be my guest. Hey. Are you comfortable? - Boss... - Shh. Save your strength. Just tell me. Who did this? The transporter. The transporter's dead. He's not. Believe me. I believe you. And the police? They were here? No... You told them nothing, right? Right. Of course. You couldn't talk. Yeah. Let's keep it that way. I picked them from the garden outside. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know if you like coffee or tea. So I made both. I hope you like, uh, Mad-e-leines... Try one. Careful! It's hot. Good? Let me. I like it quiet in the morning. Yes. Quiet in the morning. Me too, me too. I'm the same way. I like very quiet. Sorry. Are you looking for milk? Uh, there's milk at the door. Stay, stay. I'll go. Hi. And you are? The new cook. Is Monsieur Frank in? Ah, Monsieur Frank. Is your invitation for coffee still open? Sure, come on. Please, sit. Madeleine? Homemade? Yes. I'll bring some more. Ah... My mother used to make fresh madeleine every morning. I smell them and my whole childhood comes back in one big flood. Like Proust. You ever read Proust, Monsieur Frank? No. Ah. He's fantastic. Memory like a steel trap. He would have been a great cop. A real detail man. Milk? Please. Thank you. I used to have a memory like Proust. Like a filing cabinet up there. I would see something and remember it like that. Like, uh, license plates. I could see a plate and it was printed in my head. Now I need all the help I can get remembering... whose plate goes with whose car. Like uh, this one. It's mine. Ah! Memories. So, where's the rest of the car? I was hoping you could tell me. - It was stolen. - Stolen? I went down to Frejus to pick up a few things. When I came out of the market, it was... Gone? Did you report it? It's the first on my list of things to do today. It's a long walk from Frejus. How did you get home? I brought him. I saw him walking along the dark road. A risky thing. Picking up a stranger on a dark road. He had a kind face. I didn't see a car outside. It's in the garage. - May I see it? - Uh-huh. Whew! Wow. Ah. Pretty nice car for a cook. Hey, some people have a problem with the Germans. They're too aggressive. They take up the best beaches in summer. They can't cook worth a damn. I say anyone makes such great cars can't be all bad. I would say your intuition worked out very well... for Monsieur Frank, Mademoiselle. Worked out for both of us. Bon! My intuition says this is probably... a good time for me to go file my report. Where's the rest of my car? Oh, yes, I almost forgot. It was blown to pieces at a rest stop. What's left of it is down at the lab. They're trying to separate... what was left of the two cops in the trunk from the rest of it. But you wouldn't know anything about that. No. Sorry to interrupt. Thank you for the coffee and... the memories. Come back any time. Would you mind walking me? No. You have always been very quiet... about your business, Monsieur Frank. I appreciate that. Less work for mother. But this business at the rest stop, this is not very quiet. I don't suppose you would like to tell me something... besides a stolen car story? If I had one, I would. Well, may I suggest... that when the two of you show up in my office after lunch, you have one... a better one than you currently have. You are the one he wants to see, not me. Quiet! Please, I have to think. You were supposed to think last night. Yeah, well, last night, I had nightmares. About a girl who came into my nice, quiet life, screwed it all up. Everything she touched broke, and every move she made turned into a catastrophe. OK. Sorry. I'm still wondering... if I wanna know everything or nothing about you. What? Just the quiet. I thought you like quiet. Yeah, not this quiet. Are you OK? No. Good. Let's go. Go, go, go! No! Don't stay there! Frank! Come on, give me your hand! Come on. Come on, get in, get in! No! No! Get in! Lai, look. Come on. You wanna die? Get in. Calm down. OK? Don't worry. You OK? Stay here. I'm coming back. No! Wait, wait! Put it on. You OK? Sure? OK. Let's go. Frank? Is this your house? Frank? Yeah, guess. Frank! Should mind my own goddamn business. Simple rule, simple little rule. There's gotta be some dry clothes in this house. Don't open the package. Nothing but trouble if you open the goddamn package. Frank... What are you doing? Making up for the trouble. Wait, wait. - Why are you making...? - No more questions. Wait. I don't like it when things get complicated. You like things simple. Very simple. I'm not so clear about the house. Could you explain? Mmm. One more time. After I left...? After you left, we went for a walk on the beach. Had a swim. Where again? Past the point. Anyone else swimming at that time? No. Did you see anybody else swimming? No. No one. So, you took a walk, had a swim on a beach where no one else was swimming, past the point, where you can't see or be seen from the beach on either side, which makes witnesses a little hard to come by. That's the point of a romantic swim. Who wants witnesses? And then? Then we came back to the house and found it on fire. Just like that? On fire? Yes. And the 5,000 rounds of spent ammo my men found all around the house? Maybe they had the wrong house. Monsieur Frank, people with this kind of firepower... do not make mistakes about who they visit. Who would want you this dead? I don't know. Any problems with a client? I don't have clients. I'm retired. I live on my army pension. You know that. You have all the facts of who I am and who I was. You've had them for years. Any enemies you can think of? People from the past? I left the past behind when I moved here. Hmm. A past like yours, you never leave behind. I'll just be a moment. Don't leave. What are you doing? Computers know everything. You just need a password. What, are you nuts? We're in a police station. You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing. Uh-huh. Aaahh... La, la, la... Hello! See? So, where will you be staying? I don't know. My cousin has a small hotel. Thanks. But we'll manage. Without money, it would be hard. Here... It's not much but at least you won't go hungry. Thank you. - Where are you going? - Going to see that guy. Good luck. One minute. You're not coming? No. But he blew up your car. I'll buy a new one. - He burned your house. - I'll rebuild it. He tried to kill you!! And as far as he now knows, he succeeded. Look. I'm gonna give you some advice. I don't know what you were into. I don't care what you were into. But whoever wanted you dead thinks you are dead. You have a free pass to start over. Here's the advice. Start over! There are 400 people... dying in a container on a ship. My father, My sisters... The ship arrives today. They will make my father a slave. The only one who knows the container number is that guy. You're very good. What do you mean? The moment you saw those pictures in my house, you were setting me up to get involved in this. Breakfast. Giving the excuse to the cop to help me. One lie after another. Not everything is a lie. Name one thing that isn't. What happened in the house between us. That was not a lie. You were a soldier. Your job was to save people. Past tense. What does that mean? It means I got tired of seeing my best efforts get turned... into bullshit by the same people who pay me to do the job. No one cared. This time, I care. Hey. Thank you. - Bonjour! - Bonjour. No phone calls for half an hour. Hello. Surprise! Sit. Put your hands where I can see them. So, before we get to the heart of the matter, I have one question for you. Why did you try to kill me? You lied to me. You opened the package. You broke the rules. Your rules. What did you expect me to do? Recommend you for another job? What's the ship number? Mr.Transporter, we can both agree I answered your first question politely. I won't answer any more. So I suggest you kill me right now. And go screw yourself. I can't find anything. Oh, poor Frank... What did she tell you? We're smuggling people in containers? I tell you, Lai is the perfect name for her. Mr.Kwai's on the way up. Your father's here. He'll really get a kick out of this. I thought your father was in the container. Yes... I, I mean no. There are 400 people in that container. Stay where you are! She's a real heartbreaker, isn't she, Frank? Ten seconds. Two choices. The information on the paper or your brains on the desk. Now tell me I'm lying. - Nine, eight... - Lai. Lai! Give me the gun. I don't know what you're talking about. ...five, four, three, two... One. Shoot. Lai! I'm not going to let you do it! Your greed killed my mother. You want to kill me? Let them kill me! Would I kill my own daughter? Lai. Come on, now. Put it down. We'll talk. She thinks we're smuggling people in containers. I don't know where you get these ideas. Stay away! Would you kill your own father? Please. I'm begging you. Stop what you are doing. I do what I do. I am who I am. I will never change. So if you could kill me, kill me. But if you don't, get this gun out of my face! Give me. Don't! He's innocent. I know he's innocent. Oh, you have such a good heart. Always interested in saving innocent people. Well, here's your big chance. Drop your gun... and you will save one. - Kill him! - No! The police are on the way up. - What now? - Take her. Send in Lee. I need him to wrap something up. Just for the record. There aren't 400 people in that container. Only 395 made it here alive. Frank! Inspector. Am I glad you're here. What is this? This man used my partner's daughter here... trying to blackmail us. Luckily my security got the drop on him. I want to press charges. Kidnapping. Extortion. Assault. I know this man. I suppose, in your business, you have to know all types. Now should I call my lawyer? We'll handle it. I'll expect all of you down at my office to give your statements. As soon as I contact my lawyer, we'll be more than happy to oblige. Oh... Hmmm... The doctor said you will have a headache for a few days... and then everything will go back to normal. Where are they? I think you should be more concerned with where you are. What got into you? You were always so careful. I've got to get out of here. Oh... with the charges they filed, you will not be getting out for a very long time. Assaulting a distinguished... member of the international business community, kidnapping his daughter, extortion... I'm sorry, Frank, I would like to help you. But if you continue with the same old story, "I am retired, living on a pension..." I need fresh, Frank. I need new. For once I need the truth. OK. They're smuggling people. From Asia. Through Marseilles. In containers. You know this for fact? The girl told me. You believe her? Yes. In French we have a saying. "Never believe the cook." She's not the cook. Oh. I suspected. You know, Frank, no one is perfect. So you're saying you're gonna do nothing. No, I'm saying I'm going to start an investigation. And in the meantime the 400 people in that container... could be dead already. But what am I supposed to do? There are laws. Did it ever occur to you... that sometimes you have to make your own law? Like you do? At least with me it doesn't take twelve months to get the job done. Oh, yes, I know. That's what I admire about you, Frank. All that army training. All that sneaking around. A man like you could probably resolve this case in how long? Twelve hours? Less. Less? Impressive. You would be the perfect man for the job. Yes. If I were out. Yes. If you were out. Anybody moves and I kill him. Nobody make a move. Lower your weapons. He is capable of anything. If this is how you transport, I'm amazed you get any work at all. Come on, give me a hand. Maybe I should go with you? Thanks. But, uh... I'm better alone. That is a very small boat to fight a very big war. Yep. It's a good boat. Frank, here. You'll need it. Or, maybe not. Shipment's cleared. Here's the paperwork. Take the highway all the way to the first exit Lyon. Go straight to the warehouse. We'll be right behind you just in case. Hey! We are ready to go. I will not go with you. Lai, dear... How many times do you have to lie to yourself in order to sleep every night? Do you have to repeat it constantly just so it feels like the truth? I spent thousands of dollars for you to go to school... and learn English. The least you can do is speak it. I hate you. I'm still your father. Get her out of here! Give me a minute. Aaaagh... Keep him alive. Let's go. No, don't. Let's go. Bitch! Good morning. You lost? I'm looking to do a little sightseeing. This plane is not for tourists. Ha, ha. I'm not a tourist. Call this guy and tell him to meet me. Sure. Where? Down there. Here. Careful! Move up. Now! Get closer. - Steady! - No, Dad, stop! Get away! Down! Hands on your head. Move. Watch her. If she moves or I don't return, shoot her. To the water. I'm really not in the mood for a swim. March! So how did a lowlife like you end up with my daughter? I found her in a bag. Isn't that where you left her? You know nothing. Move! You got involved with the wrong girl, you dumbshit. The delivery will be made. My daughter will get over it. If I'm lucky, maybe she'll see the light. Yeah, if she's lucky, maybe you'll get hit by a truck. What do you know? I know she'll never stop being who she is. Means she'll never be you or anything like you. She'll come around. But you won't be here to see it. No! I guess she won't be coming around after all. Turn around! I'd rather see it coming. Makes no difference to me. He was a bastard. But he was still my father. Pretty impressive timing, Frank. I guess I underestimated you.
