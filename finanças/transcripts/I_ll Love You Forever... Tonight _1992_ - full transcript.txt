You can't lie to me anymore and I know what happened and so do you. You can believe what you want, you can say what you want, all right, but I'm facing something.

Fuck you! God dammit. Mother fucker. - Who was it? - Um, listen, I'm gonna have to uh, stay here for a few days, okay? - What for? - Well, 'cause I need to. I'm in an uncomfortable situation where I am right now and I. - You getting kicked out? - No, I'm not getting kicked out. I'm just. - Well then what's up, what do you need to stay here for? I'm just asking a question. - I don't wanna talk about it. - No, I wanna know why you're staying. What, who was on the phone? Was he your landlord? It was your landlord. - Yes, Ethan, it was my landlord. - Well then what's happening, what? Ran out of rent or what? - [Dennis] Nothing's happening we had a misunderstanding. - No, we're having a lack of understanding. What is going on? Are you behind on your rent? - Why're you asking me all these questions, I just said I needed to stay here for a few days. - [Ethan] You're not being straight with me, all right? - I'm not being straight with you? - No, you're not. You're not being straight with me about any of this. - [Dennis] I was straight with you. - No you weren't, all right? We went to fuckin' Palm Springs, I find out at the end of the trip why I'm there. I'm not there because I'm your friend, I'm there because I'm covering for you. - We don't have to rehash that. Did I already apologize for that? - Fine, you apologized, now I find out that you gotta stay at my place, forget it. Forget it, no, no. - [Dennis] No what? - Look, I'm starting to feel like I'm just doing you favors. - You're doing me a favor? - [Ethan] Yeah. - What do you think we just did? You think that was, I did you a fuckin' favor. - What are you referring to? - You have to ask that question? I did you a favor. Now I need a favor and you're bailing. - That was not a favor, all right. That was not a favor, don't tell me that was a favor. I don't wanna hear that. You went over the line. - You want me to get out? - Yes I want you outta here. Get the fuck outta here. (stuttering) You and your fuckin' favors, I want you outta here, now. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Get off the fucking bed. It's bullshit. You're bullshit, you're a bullshit artist and I want you the fuck outta here. - You think I fuckin' need you or something? - Enough, I don't wanna hear a fucking word, all right? I want you out. Get your fucking clothes. - [Dennis] Wake up, 'cause I don't. - [Ethan] And dress in the fuckin' hallway. - All right. - [Ethan] All right, get the fuck out. Fuck you. - [Dennis] See ya. - Like I could give a shit. - Forgot my shoes. I'm, I'm trying to figure somethin' out. I really need a drink. - Yeah, I could use one. - Go down to the bar? - Sure I'll come to the bar with you. What else is there to do, huh? I'll meet you there. Get the hell outta here, will ya? Please, leave me the fuck alone. I'll see ya there. - Take a picture of me. Take a picture. Take the fuckin' picture. Take a picture of me. Come on, take a picture of me. Please, pretty please. (distant shouting) - [Voiceover] Boom, boom, boom. - Thank you. - See anything you like? - No, not yet. How 'bout you? - I sure do. I think this time it's gonna be different. In fact I know it is. - [Ethan] You really think so? - Well I won't know unless I go over and talk to him, right? - [Ethan] That's right. - [Dennis] Buy you a drink? - Oh I don't. - [Dennis] What, you don't drink? - No I don't really drink that. - [Dennis] Would you let me corrupt? Go ahead. - Maybe I'll have a little sip. - I don't want it. (laughing) Want something stronger to go with it? - Yeah, maybe. What do ya have in mind? - Do you have the time? - Um, it's about 10 o'clock. - Do you know how late this place stays open? - Uh, two. My name's Ethan. - Hi I'm Roger. Nice to meet you.

I wanna talk to you. - [Voiceover] What is this about? - About, what about. About why, why we don't talk. About why we can't talk to each other, why I can't talk to you. - [Voiceover] You're not making any sense. - Well you never know what I'm talking about. I said you never know what I'm talking about. It's funny, isn't it. (chuckles) It's funny 'cause I never, I never talk to you. So how can you know what I'm about to. - [Voiceover] I'll call you later. - Would you just listen to me for a second please? Yeah, me. I'm not angry, I just wanna talk to you. (sighing) I want to, I just, hello? I wanna just tell you what I think of you. Yeah, yeah, what I think of you. Because you sit in judgement of me but I'm only a reflection of you, you you're the one who raised me, I didn't raise you, I didn't make you do the things that you did to me. You did them yourself all right? And it's not my fault. Hello? Well I hope you're still there because I'm still talking to you, okay? I remember what you did to me even if you claim that you don't, I do. I remember what you did to me, all right? And I'm not afraid to come out and tell you that, all right? Because it's not my fault. It's not my fault that we can't talk to each other. Don't you have anything to say to me? Did you? - [Voiceover] I can't change what happened. Did you hear me? - Mhm. - [Voiceover] Did you hear me? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Don't call me again. - Okay. - [Voiceover] Can you do that? - Okay, if that's the way you want it. I understand. - [Voiceover] Take care of yourself. - Okay. Hello? Goodbye. (ominous music)
