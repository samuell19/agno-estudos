Credits. Mekong Delta, 1999 My hometown, a land of vast green fields and army of brick kilns sinking in the golden light of dusk. There held the unforgettable memories of our youth, love and regrets. - Hey. Try to do your best. - Yes, sir. Good morning, young master. Stand up. Get out! Bridge of Destiny. 20 years later. Dad, let me enjoy my childhood, please. It's summer! Are you awake? Are you tired? I'm fine. I'm glad so many people have come. Wait, there's more guests coming. Hello Thank you for coming to my grand-opening. Darling, can you look after these people for me? Alright - Congratulations, Truc! - Oh my gosh! You're so lovely. All the best with your new store. You're my star customer. I have this second store because you've been giving me good business. Dad! Can you stand in with Mom? I'll take a picture for my memory 2,3 … You're the best! Congratulations! Yes! Thanks! I won. Move away! Move away! Out of my way, sweetheart! Who is that dyke!? New chick. Her name is Vy. Excellent! Simplicity is this year's trend. The simpler the classier. I designed those patterns especially for you. Well fit for a bar owner like you. I'll pay you extra for these two sets to make up for missing your grand-opening OK? Don't worry about it, I wouldn't take it from a friend. Alright then. There're 5 sets altogether. Should I put them all on the bill now? My god! Sure! Hey, By the way, I have a niece staying with me. I'll tell her to come by and say hello to you later. Sure! Look at you! I'm so jealous of you. - Why? - Look at me! Do you know how much work I have to put in to look like this? But you, you can wear a rag and still look beautiful. Well, you can always go for plastic surgeries. I can't stand the pain. All those needles scare the crap out of me. It messes with your mind to the point that you think your friend's husband is yours. It's quite embarrassing when you and your friend are like bitches fighting over the same bone. I don't mind sharing. Liar, liar, pants on fire! Hai My dear. Look at my dear boy. He's got a gold medal. Oh Hai, you're a star! What's wrong? I already told you I couldn't come. It's not about that, Mom. Oh! So you're tired? Sit down. I'll make you some juice. What's wrong? Who upset you, my boy? It's nothing. Hello! Hi auntie! I forgot my keys this morning. Where are you? I'm at the neighbour's. I won't be long. OK. Come on! That's right! Come on! One more, dad! One more. It looks good. We should post this clip to our fanpage. Fantastic! Hey, Cut out the bit when I get smacked on the butt. Not a very good image. - Understand? - Yeah... But my phone is so old. Can you get me a new one? There's one really good for taking photos and videos. It's only about 20 mil VND - Only 20 mil? - Yep. Forget it. Dad! Dad!!! OK, then. Hi dad! You let a boy squeeze your butt???? Good luck, dad! My God! - Are you OK? - What do you think? It hurts like hell, Mom! They mess around all the time. Such a fun family! Don't they have anything better to do? I thought you like the boy? Not at all! Really? Let me tell you something. There's nothing you can hide from me. You deserve it! Water, please Good business, huh! Good business, huh! There're tricks in every trade, my friend. You should bring your wife here sometimes. Sure thing! Hey, there's a photography competition. Let me register for us. The phone is so classy just like its owner. The phone is so classy just like its owner. Not only classy but also strong. But how durable is the battery though? Which battery doesn't run out? Anyway, you know how many tricks I had to pull to get this phone? Loony Vy. Are you crazy? Wanna hang out with us? Hi Loony Vy. Take a seat. Want to get shoved into the pool again? Uh... let's chill. There's a photography competition for international schools this summer. The winners will get a scholarship. Would you like to join our group? I have a good phone. I have skills. Your job is... to be our bodyguard. - Hey! That's a good idea. - Yeah! We're getting our body... guarded. The most important position in the group. Stop joking around. OK then. Where are we going to set up for the shoots? Where is not important. The thing is you've got to be gorgeous and impressive. You wanna be impressive? Go jump in that pond. - If you want we can jump together. - Stop it! So where would be an impressive place to shoot? My aunt's bar! Hey! You're drooling. You're in a bar. Stop jerking and start dancing. - Cheers!!! - Nope. I'm busy. Hey! That's my nephew. I thought you only have a niece. That's my niece's boyfriend. - Really? - Yep. Too bad. He's off limits. Hello, darling! Hey Loony Vy. Look at this really good looking guy. He's sitting over there. Oh my darling! Are you drunk? Yeah yeah, maybe. Thanks. I don't know what I would do if you hadn't come over. By the way, I saw you taking photos of me. Can I have a look? We're taking photos for a competition. I'll delete them if you want. No, don't. No, don't. I really like them. You can take more if you like. I mean you can take photos in my everyday life. Definitely! Tu! My classmate We found ourselves a model. A very handsome one indeed. We're very honoured. Cheers! Did I do a good job? She almost broke my hand. Good. I'm not gay! C & T Love Diary May 17th 1999. It was a sweltering hot day... when I first saw Cuong at the kiln. I had never felt such a powerful rush in my veins From that moment, I knew I found my soul mate. You're so beautiful. Do you love me? I will marry you. Thanks to you that I get to eat with my son. He usually eats in his room. Mom! I can come over every day if you like. - Me too! - Don't be stupid. Who can afford to feed you two every day? Why? I don't eat much. Vy's the one with big appetite. You're right. I'm only scared of Loony Vy. Don't say that. Nonetheless, she's Ms Tram's niece. It'd be your fault if I lose Ms Tram as a customer. It's OK. What's going on? Being attacked by the mosquitoes? No, I'm not. All of you keep eating. I've got another dish in the kitchen. Thank you. This one is good. Let me have some more. Do you want to be whipped or to be fed? Whipped. Fed!!! Ah! I mean whoops, it's hot. Vy, have some more. Don't be shy. Hai, you should have more yourself, too. Mrs Truc, will you join us? Eat more...

You seem very confident. Do you think you can charm me as you did the secretary with your good looks? I hope so. Too bad. I am not at all interested in your appearance. However, I'll give you a chance to prove yourself to me. I will not let you down. Dad, have a look these photos I took recently. Are they nice? Here. Very nice. Here are more. See!

This is my last wish. Will you do it for me? I will do anything for you. There's nothing I need but you. Mekong Delta - 1999 Good morning, young master, mistress. Good morning, young master, mistress. Men, Who's that? I think it's the young master's fiancé. She's just come back from studying abroad, right? That's right. A match made in heaven. Everyone, show me your hands! Louder! 11B3 Do you guys see Thang here? We have chosen 4 groups to move to the finals. The first group belongs to Bui Ngoc Thao, 12A1 Hello! Are you here, yet? Sorry. I'm caught up. Goodluck! OK. Thanks. I'll call you later. The third group belongs to Cao Thai Vinh, 12B6. And the last group belongs to Dinh Quang Hai, 11B3. Thank you all very much. To keep the ball rolling let's take a look at the works from Dinh Quang Hai's group. OMG! Quick! Come on, quick! This file is not ours! I have no idea. Turn it off! Hurry up! Hit escape! Hai! Where the hell are you? Hai! Hai! See you in an hour at the bar. Aren't you afraid that people might think you're gay? I'm OK with it as long as it makes you happy. You deserve better than the love of a dying woman. I will never let go even if you want me to. I'm willing to sacrifice everything if that heals you. Thang, where are you? I'm sorry. Hai! Hai! Hai, what are you doing? I should be the one asking questions! What are you talking about? I don't understand. Who is he to you? Why are you being so rude? This is my friend. Apologise to him now. Your friend? Or your lover? Damn you! Hai! Why are you hitting our son? He's got the right to be angry at you. Look! Anyone messes with my family will be properly dealt with. Don't forget that. Hai. Who are you? How are you in possession of these keepsakes? I know a lot more than you think. If you do what I want the secrets between you and Trung will be safe. If not, I will tell all your secrets to those dearest to you. I wonder who would suffer the most in this case? I think you can already guess. You set me up. Does this look familiar? Do you recognise the writing? Hai, try not to be sad. Promise you won't kill yourself in any circumstances. Huh! That's the truth. Don't be ridiculous! I'm just saying what I think. Stop joking around. What I want is for him to lose everything. I have an idea. C & T's love diary Cuong, are you going home? I'm leaving tomorrow. My mother called. She said my father is very sick. Will you come back? I don't know. It depends on how family fares. Promise you will come back. Please, promise me. Here's a lucky charm my mother gave me. I'll leave it with you as a token of our love. What's the money for? It's my saving. Take it for your father. Don't you love me? Stand up! Here you are, sir. He dares to seduce my son and steal from me. Beat him up! Stop! Stop! Dad, I beg you please. It's my fault. I come to him willingly. Take the young master home. Dad! Please, stop beating him. Leave immediately and never come back. If I ever see you again, I swear I will kill you. Attention! At ease! Ready front! Trung's dead. Can you let everything rest? Please, leave Hai out of this. What about Ha? What do you think? I will see her. Hey Thang, the rosy cheek boy who goes around giving pleasures and blows. What? Thang, the guy on the 7th floor? Oh my gosh He's my idol Yes. Your instant noodle hair guy Prick up your ears and listen clearly. Please take your delivery Move out of the way. Can't you see I'm busy watching the fight? You plan to cancel? No no I won't. Just hold on a minute. I'll take it. Come on, watch the fight with me. You come to their company to flirt with the wife, then you bang the man. There he is. What are you all doing? Stop this immediately! Or I will sue you. Everybody, Don't believe the lying man-whore. Home-wreckers have no right to threaten anyone. Go ahead. Curse him, brother. Let me tell you something. We despise homewreckers. What a despicable man! Stop! Hai, Are you happy now? Are you satisfied with the insults? Don't you think you're breaking your mom's heart? You are worried that I'm breaking mom's heart But you are doing it most brutally. - Hai. - Hai - Hai. - Wait for me! Truc - Let go of me. - Listen to me. Keep your hands off me! I will tell you everything one day. Things are not what they seem to be. Maybe by then it will be too late. Greetings to the man who robbed me of my husband. Are you happy living on my loss and pain?! I could've had a happy family just like you. I'm sorry for indirectly causing you pain. I can't change the past but I will try to make it up to you. How!? While you are living happily with your pretty wife and your lovely child? I will pull off your mask for everyone to see. You shameless douchebag. Please don't. I'm begging you. You're such a coward You have 2 options. Either you come home and tell your wife you are not a real man, Or I will. I will tell you the truth Do you know why people say "young gamblers, old beggars"? You didn't just gamble, you had to steal my money, too? Quit it now! Why are you laughing? Doesn't it hurt? Yes, but it's pleasure pain Stand up I beg you please forgive Cuong. On one condition. My god why? Do you want to drown us all in shame for what you did? Do you want me to die in shame and anger? Why? Okay. Watch. I will die right now to please you I will die right now - I will die right here. - I will marry Ha. I will marry Ha. I will die now. I will marry Ha. Dad, please! I will marry Ha. Keep your words! I guess you know everything. If you leave that person, I will pretend like nothing ever happened. I can't. I love him. I cannot live without him. But I am pregnant. Coward! I will take responsibility for the child But I cannot marry you. I will make efforts to share a part of your journey But not forever. I'm so sorry. Trung - I'm sorry. - Trung. Trung! Cuong! Cuong!

How could he... How could he change in such a short time? Doesn't he love Mom and me anymore? I feel like there's more to the story. Don't jump to the conclusion. I would never think of him as my father ever again. That is easier said than done. It's never easy to give up on someone, especially when they are your parents. I think you should calm down first and let's see how it goes. Okay? Bill please. Forty thousand. Young man, is my cooking that bad? No I'm just full Why bother coming here if you are full? You could've just ordered one bowl instead of wasting the second bowl. Sorry. I'll pay for both You only have to pay for the one bowl you eat. 20 thousand. Thank God I have enough. Here's your 20 thousand. You're making such a fuss over 20 thousand. You can pay me back later. It's ok. Thank you Alright. Thank you. Who'd take a girl out on an empty pocket? Shame on you. Wanna pick a fight? Forget it. You look so gay. What a faggot! What do you want? Good looks doesn't cut it when you have no money Where are you going? What do you want? Bastards! The cops are coming.

Even in your wildest dreams you never think this day would come, don't you Mr.Trung? Oh, I forgot... Should I call you... Mrs.Truc? Even now you still don't dare to look me in the eye?
