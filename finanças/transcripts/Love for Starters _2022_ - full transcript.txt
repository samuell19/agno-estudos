The goal is to tie in your rich history. To create a one-of-a-kind experience that will make guests eager to come back to the Skylounge at the Skylyn Hotel, again and again. You know, I was worried we were coming to hear a residential interior designer pitch to us, but everything they said about you is true, Olivia. You are quite a visionary. Thank you, ma'am. Your hotel holds a special place in my heart. It would be an honor to take on this project. We'll be in touch. Thank you. I think you pulled it off. Designing the Skylyn would be a dream come true. My mother and I always used to stay there, every time we visited the city. If this goes through, the partnership is officially yours. And, you'll have the highest grossing client, which is quite a start to this new chapter. Hey, thank you again for letting me take this trip. It really means a lot. Trip? What trip? To Crescent Lake? To help my dad get his hotel ready to open for the summer season. That's right. Must have slipped my mind. Well, enjoy it. May be the last break you get for a while. I'll see you soon, and congratulations, partner. I should be there just after 6:00. Did you need me to pick up anything for dinner? Peter: No, our new chef has it covered. New chef? I thought you were going to wait to hire someone until the design was finished, so that we could pick someone that matches the vibe of the space I create? Peter: We've had a slight change of plans, but you're gonna love him. He's great. Now, the two of you get to create the space together. Team work makes the dream work! Who is he? Peter: Dax Hutton. He's the one who did that fancy place in New York City, the one that celebrities all love. The one with all the fire drinks. Clovernax? That's the one. How did you land the chef from Clovernax? I guess I gave him an offer he couldn't refuse. He's quite a catch. Get it? Peter: He's a big name, Liv... I don't know. Peter: Which is exactly what the hotel needs. Oh, I gotta run. Drive safely. Hello, Hotel El Dorado, can I help you? Oh! How are these all my options? What kind of place doesn't have organic, smoked mineral salt? Where am I? About an hour northeast from Seattle. Do you need some help? Uh, no, I'm just looking for some salt. Well, it looks like you've got quite a few options. And they all taste the same, right? Excuse me? Salt. Can't honestly taste the difference. Kosher salt? Great. Pink Himalayan salt, different color. Same salty taste. Thank you. Uh, who are you? Oh, I was just someone doing my civic duty, trying to relieve some salt induced stress. Yeah. I'm sure whatever you choose will be perfect, but, this one's got my vote. Table salt? Yeah, it's my favorite. It's not on my list. Good luck. Ok. There she is! My beautiful baby sister. Abby! - Hi! - Hi! - Oh, I missed you. - I missed you more. Impossible. So, how are things at the pottery studio? Good. Brian's just closing up there now. Oh! Do you want to come by and make something for the new restaurant while you're in town? Uh, as long as you're up for making backups, because I have zero pottery skills. Consider it done. We've got a work station with your name on it. So, how are things with Doug the day trader? Still no ring, I see. No, no ring and no relationship. But why? I thought he was perfect. He was on paper, but I don't know, something was missing. Anyway, I don't have time, with work right now. I just had a meeting with the Skylyn. I know. And if we land this client I will finally get the official offer for partner, which needs all of my attention, so a dating break is more than necessary. A dating break? Mm-hm. No distractions. Ok. Believe me, Nancy, I do get it. The last review given to me was less than stellar. I get it. Please don't read it to me again. Nancy: Wasn't "stellar?" The Social's fillet mignon wasn't stellar. This review was horrible. Thank you, Nancy. Dax, I tried. Catch on the Lake was the only place who made you an offer. What did you want me to do? Have you seen this place? They don't even have salt options. Ok? And by the way, they're good with that. They have like four streets here. Think of it as a change of scenery. I'm an award winning chef, Nancy. Going to LA would have been a change of scenery. This is... I'm in purgatory. I get it, ok, like I need to reinvent myself. But like, couldn't I have done it in some Scandinavian pop up instead of some small town motel restaurant? This is not a motel, it is a hotel. You needed a head chef position, they gave you a head chef position. I will reach out to a few of our contacts again, just to double check, but don't get your hopes up. Nancy: Make this one count and you will be back in the New York market in no time, ok? Fine. Just don't tell anyone I'm here, ok? Your reservation's confirmed and we'll see you soon when we officially open for summer, Ms. Smith. Liv-a-div-div! - Dad! - Good to see you! How was the drive? Drive? Beautiful. Oh, it's always beautiful this time of year. I am so glad you are finally letting me do this, Dad. Yes. Sad to say, but I guess it's time. There ain't nothing sad about it, Dad. It is long past time. Oh! It looks like there's a produce delivery arriving soon? Yeah, our chef has a new produce distributor, so, hey, organic. Oh! - My gosh, are you ok? - Oh!! I think it looks worse than it actually is. Ok great. Oh, my gosh. Oh man. Let's, uh... Ah, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? I work here. And I live here. Well, my dad does. You're the interior designer from Seattle? Well, your dad talks about you so much. Wait, so if you work here, then you must be... Dax Hutton. The new head chef. I've heard about you. You're the guy that does the fancy micro meals. We like to say deconstructed dining experiences. Does my dad know about that? Well, I'm gonna assume that he does, because he hired me. Oh, so you guys have already landed on a menu? I have. We are presenting it tonight. Not sure how receptive our guests will be to having to put together their own sandwiches. I would never have them do that. Good. 'Cause, uh, sandwiches are the least exciting food on the planet. I wouldn't ever serve that at one of my restaurants. Have you ever eaten at one of my restaurants? I have. Yeah? Oh, good. The deconstructed coffee you served in the little beakers. Yeah. That was... That was an adventure. Mm-hm. So, it wasn't a high-concept multi-layered dining experience for you? I really just wanted a cup of coffee. Well, it was meant for a very sophisticated pallet, so... Well, uh, can't wait for dinner tonight. Sure it will be an experience. I can't wait for you to experience. Mm-hm. Stuck here. Oh here, let me help you with... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Noise cancelling! They seem to work really well. They really do. - Here, let me. - Oh, thank you. Oh, my goodness. First day with a new client and I'm a little nervous. You are Bridge... - Bridget Benton. - Oh. Is this your first time in the hotel? Because it's a beautiful place, but the food, meh, it's just all right. But, I'm really excited to know what the new chef is gonna do with the menu. Well, it's a good thing I hired him then, right? I'm Peter Adler, the hotel owner. Oh, my gosh. Hi, so sorry. You're fine, you're fine. I know the menu needs an upgrade. It's nice to meet you, Bridget. These are my daughters, Abigail and Olivia. Girls, this is our new produce distributor, Bridget. Yeah, hi, well it's really nice to meet you both. - Nice to meet you too. - Nice to meet you too. This place is great. You know, are you open all year round? Because I'm thinking that I might just have to book myself a little getaway when you're back up and running. Romantic weekend? Oh, no. No, no. Oh, no! No, not that I wouldn't want a romantic weekend here, it's just, well, I need someone to do it with. I'm single! Oh, geez, why did I say that? Well, um... the... the... the kitchen is through here, so why don't I help you with these? - Please. - And, um... Bridget: Thank you. Peter: Just through here, around the corner. Bridget: Thanks. She seems nice. More than nice, I'd say lovely. That's the perfect word for the sweet farmer lady. Both: Lovely. So I tried to stick to the brief as much as possible but your ideas were a little all over the place. I think Lake Yacht is a really solid jumping off point. And it was, but I just want to make sure The Catch feels like an extension of the El Dorado. By the way, Dad, have you given Dax any direction on the menu? I gave him full creative control. What's up? Oh, Brian's just giving me an update. Update on what? We're hosting a little gallery night to fundraise for scholarships to our pottery school. It gives us a chance to give back to the community and also allows for us to showcase some of our students' work. I have a piece there and I'm really proud of it. I think I could go pro. Dinner is served. First, we have the smoked salmon crisps with capers and black pepper Boursin. Then, we have the frisee and carrot ribbon salad with za'atar lemon vinaigrette. And finally, and I think you're gonna like this one, caviar frites with trout roe and creme fraiche. And I'm sorry, what kind of salt was used on the salad? Only your favorite. Is that french fries with fish eggs? Uh, it's trout roe with... You know what, yeah. In layman's terms, that is exactly what that is. Right. All right. Well, should we dig in? Good. Enjoy. I'll just be back there. Ok. I can say confidently that I don't think our patrons are gonna want fish eggs on their french fries. I'm gonna have to second that. I don't even know what half these ingredients are. Dad, this is not what I had in mind. Ditto. This is all very... Fancy? Yeah. What Catch needs is the "wow" factor and this certainly has that. Is it too late to find another chef? One who cooks food people are familiar with? Honey, Dax is essential. He, he's a big name. He, he'll draw in the clientele that we need. Clientele we need? What do you mean? Is business not doing well? Business is, is fine, it just, it could, could be better. But, but that's why I hired Dax. He has a huge following. He gets lots of press. Yeah, but Dad, this is beautiful, it's elegant. But we can't serve this. This isn't a fine dining establishment. We can't really break his contract, I mean, backing out now would be, well... It's un, undoable. I need you to work with him, Liv. It's the only option we have. Ok. At least we know he's got a sense of humor. Dressing, anyone? Dax: I hate, I just hate it. Olivia: Hate them? What do you mean you hate them? Can we at least agree on black tie and like a six-month waitlist? I hope you're kidding. Oh, I'm not kidding. I'm thinking elegance. There's a reason why a black tie, six-month waitlist type of place doesn't exist here. Ok. But if we make it good, I mean like really, really good, they'll get an appetite. Or, they'll be too scared to try it because it's super fancy and they don't recognize anything on the menu- I don't think so. So they'll avoid it and business will tank. I don't think so. I'll level with you, ok? Ok. My dad wanted Lake Yacht as the theme, and I told him, it's a no go. But, I do want to give him something along the same vein. Just, elevated. Uh-huh. I really don't want to be rude. That's what someone says right before they're rude. But, in my opinion, I think these designs are... Homey. Comforting. Classic. Mm. See, I was going to say kitschy, boring and ordinary. Dax, this is not some downtown hotspot, ok? - Ok. - Ok. Wait, where're you going? Just, um... What are these? Oh, these are my designs. Oh, ok, so now you're the chef and the interior designer? Oh, well, I think it's only fair the interior designer has opinions on the menu, that the chef should have opinions on the interior design. Oh, this is all wrong. What is... No. No. No? I mean, this looks amazing. No. Dad? What's wrong? You ok? You remember that list of restaurant critics you sent me? The ones I told you to reach out to once the design was finished? I had some time and I put a few feelers out and guess what? Walter Gregson has just agreed to review us for his hometown hotspot series. Um, did you just say Walter Gregson? Who's Walter Gregson? He's coming here? He's only the biggest restaurant critic in North America. Wow. Yeah. This guy is a big deal. Yeah. I told him we had our new celebrity chef redoing our menu and he was all of a sudden very interested. Yeah, I'm sure. I didn't think he'd get back to me so quickly. Or that he'd want to stop by so quickly. How quickly is "so quickly?" A few days. Days? Did you say days? Ok, so we have a few days to get this place ready? Did you at all get a vibe that you could maybe push it like a couple days, maybe a year or two? I don't think that's an option because he's already confirmed, and backing out now would look... Bad, yeah. Right. But I have all the faith in the world in you two. Oh, good. You can do it. Right? Right? Yes, Dad. Right, Dax? Mm-hm. Don't worry. We... we can do it. Great. Then I will get out of your hair and let you two get to it. - Ok. - Ok. Do you want to get some air? - Oh, air would be so good. - Ok. I mean, what are we supposed to do? A bad review from someone like this could sink this place. Yeah, it could. It's why I say we stick with my plan. Look, you're clearly very talented and Walter Gregson is really interested in you. So, what's the catch? Your father offered me a job and I took it. And my father's offer was far more superior than all the other offers you must have received, Mr. Celebrity Chef. Fine, yeah, this is a reset from my last job. What happened at your last job? I was let go. I got a bad review from a critic that was not fully deserved. Who gave you this bad review? Walter Gregson. Ah. So you're telling me that my dad hired the one chef Walter Gregson already doesn't like. Like I said, the review wasn't my fault and there was too many people, wanted too many things... And there was too many... Too many cooks in the kitchen? What are you doing? Looking up your review. "While the place is poorly managed, "the food is no better. "The food reflects Dax Hutton's usual flashy style "but lacks any inspiration." That was the kind of food management wanted, so that's the kind of food that I made. Which, in retrospect was a giant mistake. And it's one I'm not going to make again. Dax, we cannot get a review like this one. I mean, my dad would never admit this, but he put everything he had into this place after my mom passed. So, we gotta find a way to make this work. We need to create a space that's authentic, that Walter Gregson cannot help but fall in love with. I get it. Ok. Let's get to work. - Ok. - Ok. Black truffle duck confit with creme fraiche and caviar. You're gonna love it. No? You're not feeling that. Ok, ok. I have my signature dish, I mean this is... problem solved. Ok. Wild pacific, big eyed tuna poke with avocado crema and toasted orange zest. I dare you to say no. Do you have anything like grilled salmon? Or smoked ribs? Or chicken, roasted chicken? Simple. Nice, roasted chicken. Yeah. You just flew me out from New York to make roasted chicken. I feel like you could do a really good roasted chicken. You could make roasted chicken. Hold on, I got it, all right. Ok. You want to take a train to flavor-town? You ready? Simple, Chilean sea bass with palm puree, champagne truffle sauce... Champagne truffle sauce. Yeah. How well do you know Crescent Lake? I... well, I don't know Crescent Lake. Exactly. Let's go. You need to get to know the area to cook for the area. So you... none of these? Olivia: No. What exactly is this? It's a Seattle style hot dog. Aka, sea-dog. - It's delicious, I promise. - Mmmhmm. Look, I'll try anything, but you gotta understand in New York, the hot dog is sacred and this thing has cream cheese on it. I know, but without it the other toppings don't shine. Just try it. Try it. For you. So? Oh, you want my opinion on it? Yeah. It wasn't what I was expecting. But you're right, cream cheese kind of makes the grilled onions and the jalapeños kind of sing. I told you. Yeah. So, you'd say you liked it? I'd say, it's surprisingly not terrible. That's it? The sauerkraut and brown mustard are a little intense. But I get it, I feel you. I feel you, Seattle. I get the charm. I want something like this on the menu. That is what you're up to. No. I didn't say this exactly, but, you know, an elevated version. I don't do street food. Then I guess you'll have to make an exception this time. You're trouble. All right. I'll consider it, if you consider silk napkins. We can't do silk, the maintenance on it is too costly and it's not durable enough. But, I will agree to a high-end alternative. I am a hard no on granite floors. I could compromise on that. Good. Don't get used to this. What's with the heart locket? Your sister has that too. What's inside? I have no idea, actually. My mother gave them to my sister and I when we were really little with hidden messages inside, but the key has since been misplaced, so until it reappears, I'm wearing a mystery around my neck. I am very curious to what's in there. Me too. Thank you. It looks like there's some menu changes really happening. Yes, there are. Hey, you wouldn't care to stay for dinner, would you? I mean, you're already here. I wouldn't want to impose. Oh! Are you ok? It's no bother. I always make extra. Then I'd love to. Great. Ok. Hey. Oh, Bridget, thank you for doing another trip. It's really not a problem at all. Dax, you'll stay for dinner right, I'm making my world famous ribs. Well, I... I insist. The more the merrier. The more the merrier. I mean... I'll stay. Great! So, Dax, I heard you went to the spring fair today. It's the best, right? Yeah, it was, um... It was inspiring. He had a sea-dog. Oh, so good. So, did we land on menu and design? I'd say we're off to a good start. I would agree. Great. Pass the wine. Oh, sorry. Here, I'll get it. Pass him the wine, if you would like? Thanks. Mr. Adler, your ribs, delicious. Oh yeah. Come on now, it's Peter. Yes, sir. I mean, Peter. The trick to the ribs is long, slow smoking with at least four different kinds of wood. Mm. What's in the sauce? Ah. That's a family secret. Little brown sugar, sprinkle of chili and crushed pineapple. That's it! The crushed pineapple. It gives it that sticky sweet flavor and texture. Oh, that's smart. That's a good combo. Liv calls is the Catch Twist. We used to put it on everything, back in the day. Everything. Dax: I don't blame you. You should sell that sauce. So, yesterday when you said capture the essence, you meant... Oh, I think I nailed it. Yeah. And this is all inspired by the spring fair? The color pallet was. Ah, ok. That's a step. I just thought that we were blending upscale and homey. I did. Oh. I used white flour instead of organic quinoa flour. Ok. It's good. What? You know what? Let's just pause on the menu for a beat and get started on the design. Come on! You... So, I've narrowed down the colors for the accents. You wanted neutrals, I wanted something more rich. So, I picked colors that were solidly in the middle. Mmmhmm. And like we agreed, all of the final decisions are made together. So, sand dune cladding or walnut? Sand dune. Ok. That was easy. Now, sand dune or cherry wood? Yeah, it's kind of heavy, I get that. Maybe as a stain? Oh. Yeah. I kind of like a cherry wood stain. All right. I think that's the winner. Still understated, but it's... - Still elegant. - Yeah. And it won't overshadow that landscape. Wow. It's beautiful. Yeah. I mean, this is the star of the show. No matter how good the food is or how on point the decor. People will always want to come to this place for this. Olivia: Yeah. Exactly. Dax: Amazing. What? It's just funny. What you notice when you finally stop and slow down. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah, it really is. Well, now we get to speed up again. No. Let's get started. Come on! I am so happy my dad's letting me do this. Cheers to that. And once we finish the dining area we can give our bar a little makeover. What? What is this? Oh, my gosh. This was my mom's. I wonder how it got here. Oh! Is that you? Yeah, it is. We were pretty adorable, huh? Yeah. That's my mom. Sandra. Aw. Oh, my gosh. It's mom's take out menus. She would get these wherever she went and she'd cross off the menu item she tried. And she had a rating system. So, the heart meant she loved it, the star meant she thought other people would like it, and then the red X... She didn't like it so much. Exactly. Oh, man. I loved this place. Their tochos were so good. Did you just say "tochos?" Tater tot nachos. They're amazing. We don't have these in New York. Oh, yeah. This is the old diner by the fish market. They were so good until they sold to a chain. Oh, this one. They had the best burgers in town, then they became a brunch spot. Stuffed blue cheese salmon burger with grilled onions and a fried pickle! Mm-hm. That one was... You know this is the most comprehensive culinary history of Crescent Lake you're probably ever going to get. Some of these are 20 years old. Amazing. Do you mind if I hang onto these for a little bit? Yeah, sure. I'll give them back, I promise, I just, these are incredible. Whatever you need, Mr. Chef. Thank you. Now, we paint. So, when you said "catch twist" you meant... Something unique to this place. To my family, to you, you know, something to really make it ours. Ok. Oh you, you missed a spot. I did not. Oh, you did. Where? Right there. Okay, well, you just pointed to the whole thing, so. Yeah, you're not a very good stainer. All right. You know what? I think you missed a spot. Yeah? Yeah. Right there. Actually, a bunch of spots, it looks like you missed that spot too as well as that one and then that one. This is my favorite space suit. - En garde. - En garde. Oh! You're gonna pay for that one. Olivia: Jab! Hey, what's going on here? - Uh, just painting. - Nothing. Uh-huh. Well, the new light fixtures just arrived, do you want me to bring them in? Oh, no, it's ok. We can grab them. Hey, you ok? Yeah. Our caterer for the pottery show just bailed. Oh, no. And I'm scrambling to find somebody in literally 48 hours. Oh, I'm sorry. What? Well... What about Dax? What about Dax? Well, it could be a good trial run? Could test some recipes on a smaller audience, see how they're received. That's actually not a bad idea. A trial run for Walter Gregson. Actually, that couldn't hurt. Uh-huh. Oh my gosh, Dax, you're a lifesaver. I'll email you all the info right away. Ok? Thanks. You know, this does mean, you're my new sous chef. - Oh, does it? - Yeah. Can't wait. Olivia: Another one done. Ok. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. I just, there's just a lot riding on this fundraiser. We want to make sure we can continue to give back to the community, you know? Well, sounds like I need to be using my fancy handwriting. Yes, that's exactly what we need. Item tags no one can read. Like a little... Oh, sorry, it's my boss. Jasmine, hi. Olivia, darling, sorry to call so late. Are you sitting down? No, why? You might want to. We landed the Skylyn! Jasmine: I'll email over everything now. They are ready to work. Oh, I thought the start date wasn't for three weeks? It's all in the brief I'm sending over. Jasmine: You might have to cut your trip short, a bit. I can't cut my trip short, Jasmine. It's part of being a partner in the most sought-after design firm in the country. Jasmine: Oh, and we landed a huge new designer, Kenzie Rob. Have you heard of her? She's perfect for the Skylyn. Oh, I gotta go, see you Monday. Oh... What? No, this design is all wrong. Hey. Hi. Fabric for curtains, which do you prefer? I like the one on the left. That was my choice as well. Great minds think alike. So, my designer, my chef, what's on deck today? Well, Dax is doing the appetizers for Abby's pottery fundraiser, so I was thinking we could head down to the studio, get a feel for the space and then maybe pick out some pieces for Catch. You're the boss. All right. - Later. - Bye. Do you travel a lot for work? Yeah, well, I have, in the past. I bet that's hard on a relationship. Well, I have one relationship to maintain and that's my restaurant. Anything else has to come second. I totally get that. Relationships just take up so much time. And energy. Yeah. Energy that ends up taking away from work. And it makes the work suffer. Mm-hm. Which is why I am taking a dating break. It's always good to do, once in a while. Get all that time and energy back. Exactly. So, we're here for you to see the space and for us to pick out some dish-ware. Hey, guys. I've got your stations all set up. Our what? Come on! Uh, Abs, are you sure we couldn't just buy some pieces you've already made? You could, but this is more fun. Ok. So to start, make sure both of your machines are turned on on the right-hand side. And make sure both of your hands are wet, using your water bowl. Start to pump the wheel quickly, we're trying to loosen up the clay. And as you pump, push the clay forward. There you go, that looks great. When the clay is loosened up, we call it complies, you can either continue to raise it up into something like a vase, or push it down for a bowl or a cup. The trick is to keep the clay moving so it doesn't dry prematurely. Got it? - Got it. - Got it. Ok, great. I'll be just over here if you need me. I don't got it. Neither do I. She lost me at "get your hands wet." I don't, I don't know. What? Is that your focus face? I don't have a focus face. Oh, you have a focus face. I don't look like that. Ok, fine, well if that's mine then this is yours. Yeah. I have never made that face in my life. Yes, you have. You were literally just doing it. I look nothing like that. You're gonna charm all the ladies with that face. This? - Yeah. - Like that. You two are having way too much fun over here. Are we almost ready to get those pieces into the kiln, or is this just a practice round? - Practice. - Practice. Okay, well, you let me know when you're ready to take the next step. I think we should probably just buy some of Abby's pieces for Catch. Oh, wait, so you're saying you wouldn't serve my award winning summer salad in this? Uh, no, I'm sorry. I would not. Whatever, I'm holding out hopes this might be like a centerpiece or something. Don't hold your breath. Well, it looks like this is the best we're gonna do. Should we get these into the kiln? Lead the way. Yeah, so these are better than ours. Yeah. Ours aren't even close. We should probably buy some of Abby's pieces. What? Accept defeat? I don't think we have another option. Anything catch your eye? Yeah, can you make us a dozen of these? Excellent choice, I'll get to work. Thanks. So, I gotta go work on the recipes for tomorrow. Mm-hm. Do you want to come, taste test? Yeah, I'd love that. Let me just see if Abby needs help cleaning up and I'll meet you there? Ok. My baby sister finally letting herself have fun for once. What? I have fun. I haven't seen you smile like that in a while. Like that, that smile! I've missed that smile. You guys kind of make a great team. Ok. I need to get back to work. He seems like a great guy, Liv. And he's cute, and he can cook. Bye, Abby. Hey. Hey, Nancy. You've had an offer. I have? Nancy: Yes. There's this trendy new tapas bar opening in the South Village. They just fired their last chef and want you in first thing tomorrow. What about Catch? What about Catch? Nancy: You hate it there, and you're right, you never should have had to take this job in the first place. So, how soon can we get you on a plane back to New York? Pump your breaks, Nancy. I can't. What was that? I said I can't leave. Dax: Walter Gregson is coming to review this place. Plus, there's Abby's studio show tomorrow and there's the grand reopening. I can't leave them with no chef. They will be fine. I can have Tony book you on a flight tonight. I'm not leaving them hanging. They hired me to do a job, I'm gonna see it through. If you're not on a plane tonight they'll hire someone else. Let em. I'm not bailing on Catch. Are you serious? I think you're making a huge mistake, Dax. Of course you do. I beg to differ. Bye Nancy. What's wrong, Dad? Nothing, I, nothing. Um, if I were to say, extend an invitation to someone, someone I just met who, to Abby's fundraiser, do you think... I think you should just call her. You know what, I don't want to bother her. She's sweet and funny and, you know, I've seen the way she looks at you. Plus, Dad, you haven't been excited about someone in a long, long time. It's your life, but calling her has my vote. Bridget, hi, it's Peter Adler. Um, how are you? Great. I'm doing well, thank you, how are you? Uh, sorry. I just asked you that. Listen, Abby is having a fundraiser tomorrow. Um, I thought maybe you would like to go with me as a date? Uh no, not a date. Oh, you would. Great! Then I'll pick you up tomorrow at 5:00? Perfect. Ok. I'll see you tomorrow. Ok. She said yes! Great! Now we just need to get you an outfit. Uh. Jeans? Jeans still in style? Always in style, yep. - Ok. - Ok. Just, maybe not that plaid shirt you like. It doesn't work, it's dated. What's all this? It's just some little things to make your life here feel more normal. Smoked salt? Thank you! This is really sweet. Look, I am just trying to get us all a good review. The sooner we get this place on the map, the sooner we can get back to our lives. Right. Right. Well, should we get to work? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're good. Zupa! What? You got it! - Zupa! - You got it! Whoa! Hey, eyes closed, you. Wait, how do I know you're not gonna feed me like, straight mustard or something? Oh, you don't like mustard? No, I do, just not on its own. I promise I will not feed you straight mustard. Really? All right, I pinky promise. Ok, thank you. All right. Are you ready? Yeah. Wait, is this... A sea-dog inspired popper, yes. You did it! I knew how much it meant to you so I made it in a way that wouldn't completely crush my soul. I encased the flavorings and the toppings in a toasted puff pastry to, you know, just get away from that, like, street food thing. Yeah, it's perfect. I love it, thank you. - All right. - What is next? This is a riff on one of your mother's favorites. The mac and cheese... Lobster bites! This is fantastic. I just thought it would be perfect for appetizers for Abby's event. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. What's next? Deconstructed cheesecake. No, you promised me. I'm kidding. I swear. You were so mad. A promise is a promise. And I promise. Really, what's next is a fig bite with brie and pear. Yep, that's good. But? I feel like it might be missing something. Alright, what's that? Something to bring out the sweetness of the fruit but not overpower it. Hold on. Let me see. Oh, this oughta be good. Hm, no. This one. Do, do you know what you're doing, or what these spices are? No, just following my nose. Ok. This one. Ooh. Really? Oh, that'll be perfect. Let's try this here, put a little bit of this on there. There. Give that a try. That's, um... That's fantastic! Really? Really? That was cardamom, right? I'm tasting cardamom. Uh... You don't even know! Yeah! Yes. Cardamom. It's like fruity and piney. It adds all these extra layers. I bet you if I soaked pear in a cardamom marinade it would add all these extra layers. Oh my... Good work. Well, what can I say? I'm basically a world famous chef. Oh. Are you? Yeah, I make a mean PB&J. Well I'd like to try that sometime. Oh, I should go. I gotta prep these for tomorrow. So, thank you for lending me your nose, sous chef. Anytime. Monday, right? Hey, kiddo. Hey. You're up late. Well, no breaks when you're on a deadline. So... How are things in Seattle? I feel like we haven't seen you much lately. I know, I'm sorry about that. It's crazy at work. It's just one thing after the other. I keep saying to myself, I'll take a break after this next one and then something comes up and the cycle continues. Well, you gotta take breaks to enjoy your life. I know, and I will, once this Skylyn project's done. You don't sound too excited. Well, I am. I am, I just... Well, my boss sent me the brief and it looks nothing like what I had planned. But, I'm not the designer anymore, I'm managing this job so I have to let the designers do their thing. Is that what you want to do, manage the jobs? Well, it's what a partner does. Plus, I've worked so hard for this, it would be silly to be anything other than thrilled at the opportunity. But are you? I know how hard you work and you always do the right thing. But, for what it's worth, I've seen a change in you over the last few days. You seem more present, less stressed. More like your old self. Well that's just because I'm home. It's just... sometimes the thing we think we want and the thing we actually want aren't always the same thing. Just in case you need a little guidance. I was waiting for the right time to give it to you. Not saying now is when you should open it, but... I think it's time for you to have it. Night, kiddo. Night. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Ah, I couldn't sleep. You? Same. It's so clear. I didn't realize how much I missed the stars until I came here. Yeah, me too. You see the big dipper? No. Right there. I don't see it. You see that big star right there? Yeah. Ok. Now just look just to the left. Anything? No. I see that bright one, but... The bright one... Yeah. And then go to the left, down... Oh! Across, up. I see it. It's beautiful. It really is. I, uh... I should go. Yeah, it's getting late. Get some sleep. You too. 'Night. Goodnight. Wait! No, it's not ready yet! Woah. I'm on your team, remember? I know. Also, that looks crooked. What? No, it doesn't! Dax: Yeah. It does. There. Thank you. So? Are you excited about tonight? Dax Hutton, are you nervous? If this goes well, it'll be one step closer to a good review. Yeah, a little nervous. Well, I have no doubt that it will go well. Thank you. Oh, I have something for you. Are you serious? What is that? Gonna make this official. Oh. Oh, no. Now, you look like a pro. I look like a marshmallow. Little bit. Hold on. Let me fix it for you. There you go. Thanks. Perfect. Well, we should get going. I don't want Abby to worry. Ok. Ok, how do you think it's going? Looks pretty good to me. Right, that's what I thought. Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Who did the catering? The new chef at Catch on the Lake. I didn't realize that place was still open. It reopens next week. This is part of their sunset menu. You should stop by. I definitely will. Nice job. Get ready, Walter Gregson. Yeah, I'm coming for that good review, Gregson. Nice work. Yeah, you too, Chef. Who did this piece? It's remarkable. I'd like to put in a bid for it. Really? Yes, it's exquisite. That detail. Ok, well, I'll open up a bidding spot for this one. Exquisite? Did she not see the detail? I mean, it's gorgeous. Dax: She likes the droopy part. Hey, we're all gonna have a bonfire by the lake later tonight if you want to join. Yeah, I'd love to. Cool. I am gonna start cleaning up. Ok. Looks like the food is a hit. Nice job, son. Thank you, sir. I know a small place like this probably wasn't your first choice, but I am really glad you came here. Yeah, me too. Well, that was a success. I'll say. And if you told me Dax's piece would sell for the highest amount, I wouldn't have believed you. - No offense. - No, none taken. You know, I guess fine art takes a sophisticated pallet to understand. Yeah, something like that. How did we do in terms of fundraising? We exceeded our goal. We can offer four new scholarships instead of just two. Oh, Abs, that's fantastic. Hey, thank the chef over there. I do what I can. Oh, I love this song. Oh, I do too! May I have this dance, my good sir? The pleasure would be mine. Come on. Come on. Do you know this song? Nope, do you? No. Shall we? Yeah! What? Nothing. Just thinking about how arbitrary things like dating breaks are. What? You gotta admit he's kind of great. Yeah. Yeah, he's really great. But, I am going back to Seattle, so our lives aren't compatible at the moment. I think you guys could work something out. Dad needs him. Catch needs him. And I just made partner. It's off the table for me too. So, the dating break is staying firmly in place until I have a better grasps on things. You know, love is a funny thing. Sometimes it sneaks up on you when you least expect it. And you don't even realize it until it's too late. I'm just saying, promise me, if you think you found something even remotely close, you'll at least let yourself explore it. Even if it doesn't look the way you expected. My lady? May I have this dance? You may. Ok, open your eyes in 3, 2, 1. Abby: Liv. You guys. Olivia: Do you like it? Honey, it's perfect. All right. Who's ready to eat? Liv, you pulled this off in record time. It's amazing. Wait for the food. The food is here. First, we have a smoked salmon tart with a side of double baked rosemary bread. Then, we have slow roasted short ribs with Swiss chard and goat cheese polenta. And finally, we have a summer citrus arugula salad with a pomegranate reduction. Now, for the sauces, we have honey dijon mustard, a red wine ketchup and for the Catch twist, we have Mr. Adler's famous pineapple barbecue sauce. I had a friend from New York do me a favor and make these up. They're not perfect, but I mean, if you like them we can have them made up into small batch barbecue sauces and you could sell them here. I hope it's ok. I used Sandra's favorites as a guide to make a best of Crescent Lake menu. But, with a twist. Dax, this is... It's perfect. It's absolutely perfect. Well, enjoy. Wait a minute. You're gonna join us, right? Honestly, I would love to. I call the short rib. All right, let's dig in. Abby wants the short rib. It looks so good. Dad wants the barbecue sauce. Abby: T minus ten minutes until show time! Copy that, thanks Abs. Hello. Olivia, what's going on? Are you still not back? You said Monday. Well, now I need you tomorrow. Mrs. Codin moved up the start date again? Olivia, you know what this client means to our company. I'd expect more from my newest partner. Jasmine: What's going on with you? Wayward used to be your number one priority. I know, I know. I'm... But I'm, I'm just really... Jasmine: No, I can't have any "buts" Olivia. I need your head in the game. If it's not, then we might have to go in a different direction. Is that what you want? No. No, of course not. If you're not back in Seattle by tomorrow morning, we'll have to remove you from the partner position. And potentially, reevaluate your position at Wayward completely. Do you think he likes it? It's so hard to tell with him. That could be a good sign. What do you think he's writing? I don't know. Hold on. Woah! Good evening, sir. Hello. I was just coming to see if you needed any more water, but it looks like you're good. Ok. Um... Mandarins. I noticed that you are enjoying the mandarins on the salad, that's also one of my favorite parts of the salad. As you were. Smooth. Did you see what he wrote down? I did not. No. Oh, I think he's done. Should I, should I say something? Dad, go, go, go. Thanks again for coming, Mr. Gregson. Did you get a read on him, at all? Nothing. Well, it looks like my work here is done. Done? Wait, what do you mean? Well, we got the place up and running. That was the goal. So, Dax, you can take it from here, right? Unless you've got some other pressing engagement. What? No. Don't you want to stay for a bit and relax? I mean, you worked the whole time you were here. I mean, I would love to but I gotta go deal with this. Just call me if... Well I'm only an hour away if you need me. - I love you, Dad. - Bye. - I love you too. - Bye. Olivia, wait, wait. Are you ok? You seem... What? I don't know, is something wrong? You tell me. I don't- I have to go. You know, Dax, I get it. Ok, Crescent Lake isn't fancy, we're not like the cities you're used to, but... I really thought... My family is really counting on you, so if you're planning on making some changes you should let them know as soon as possible. Just so no one gets hurt. Hurt? It was nice meeting you, Dax. I have no doubt you'll find what you're looking for. I found what I'm looking for. I would love a list of your available chefs, my family might have a position opening up at their restaurant and I just want to be prepared. Thank you. There she is. Look, I saw your second round of notes on the design, I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree. Why did you offer me the partnership? Because you brought in a huge client. Not because of my skills or technique or unique perspective or our shared vision? I mean, sure, but also because you landed Skylyn. Firms all over have been wooing Hailey Codin for months, but you got her to sign on the dotted line. Now, you have a lot to catch up on... No, I don't. You lied to me. You said that they wanted to move up the start day, they wanted to go in a different direction from my design, but I just got an email from Mrs. Codin and none of that's true. Sure. The move up was my idea. But... And this new designer, Kenzie Rob? Was she Mrs. Codin's idea or yours? Kenzie Rob is a hot up and comer. Getting her on board is huge for our company. Even if she's not right for the space. I mean, her designs are nothing like what Mrs. Codin wanted. Thank you for the offer, but... consider this my official resignation. I quit. What? Why? Because I can't work for a company that goes behind my back. That doesn't value or trust my instincts. Please give my regards to Mrs. Codin. Abby, hi. Hey. I'm sorry for leaving so quickly. I just, well, Dax is planning on leaving. I guess he got an offer at another restaurant. And I was hoping that he would tell you guys, but... Are you sure about that? Pretty sure. Yeah. Olivia, he just signed a three-year contract. I don't understand. I guess he cares about the place, so he decided to stay. Abby: And now you're freaking out because you think you might have blown it with the guy you're in love with, right? Well, at least you still have the Skylyn. Uh, about that. I quit. It's about time. Wayward is cool and all that, but what you bring to the table is so personal and so authentic. They never valued that. Thanks, sis. Um, do you think I'm too late? Oh no. You have hours until the grand reopening. Not that. You know, you're just gonna have to get here and find out. Thank you for all of this. What you created here with Liv is something extraordinary. Thank you. Really, for the opportunity. Getting to create this with you all is... I mean, this is something I will never forget. I think your daughter is really special. Yeah, she is. Can I have everyone's attention, please? Thank you for joining us as we reopen The Catch on the Lake. The menu was designed by the award-winning Dax Hutton and the space was designed by my youngest daughter, Olivia, who unfortunately couldn't be here tonight. But with that being said, please enjoy, we are so very thankful to share this momentous occasion with you all. Enjoy, everyone! What are you doing here? Just trying to follow my heart, for once. Have you seen Dax anywhere? Uh, he's around here somewhere. Ok. Hey. - Liv. Listen... - Dax, I am so... Ladies first. Abby told me about you turning down the job in New York. I was never even considering it as an option. They really wanted you. I really want to be here, have a home base. A menu I'm proud of. An incredible space I feel connected to. So you're staying in Crescent Lake? As long as Crescent Lake will have a celebrity chef. That's really good to hear. I think I might be here a while myself, actually. Wait, what about Seattle, the partnership? I quit. Oh. There were too many cooks in the kitchen and no shared vision. And a relatively wise guy taught me that listening to my gut is the only way to go. What happens now? I don't know. I sent an email to Mrs. Codin explaining my resignation and thanking her for the opportunity. But I'm, I'm going to take a beat. I'm gonna actually relax. Spend some time with my family and then I'll hit the ground running, and... Look for some new clients. Dax, I'm sorry for not trusting you and for leaving the way that I did. You know you're a really good guy. You're so kind and creative and a little stubborn, but you know, that's just 'cause you know what you want. I've gotten into this habit of putting work above everything. My family, my happiness, love. I just don't want to do that anymore. - I got it open. - You got it open? Mmmhmm. Oh. "Success is fleeting. Love is forever. "Treat them both accordingly, Mom." I like that. Dax, Olivia, get in here, hurry! Come on! You guys did it! Did what? What is this? Here, you read it. It's Walter Gregson's review. "Catch on the Lake. "A quaint but sophisticated lakefront spot "is a must try on my hometown hotspots list." Ok. "The view is incredible, the decor is impeccable "and the food is everything I hoped it would be and more. "Catch on the Lake was the most charming "waterfront dining experience I've had in a decade "and I cannot wait for my next trip. "Ten out of ten hometown hotspot." Hey! We did it. Oh, my gosh, we did it. Mrs. Codin. What are you doing here? I don't want to impose, but, I'm sorry, where are my manners? You must be Peter. Hi. And you must be Dax. Uh, yeah, hi. I'm Hailey Codin, owner of the Skylyn Hotel. When Jasmine told me that you were working on a project here I wanted to come and see it in person. And, it's as perfect as I imagined. I wanted to see the design, but after I tried that food, I wanted to discuss our options. Have you thought about franchising, or opening a sister restaurant? Because this is exactly what I was thinking for the Skylounge. I can see it now. Catch of the Sky. Oh, Mrs. Codin, I don't work for Wayward anymore. I know. We're also no longer with Wayward. Their vision was all over the place, but yours... After I saw what you two created here, I thought yes, this is it. Anyway, think about it, will you? Let me know if you'd like to discuss anything further. Mrs. Codin! Wait! We'll give you two a moment. I don't know what to say. I mean, do we do it? Another restaurant, together. Mm-hm. I mean, it doesn't sound terrible. No, I've definitely had worse job offers with worse coworkers. Yeah, same. You know, Dax, I would love to do another space with you, I really would, but... You're worried about compromising your creative vision. Well, if we're gonna do this, I think... I think we need to set some ground rules. Ok. First off, since presumably we'll have a bigger budget, I want silk napkins. Oh. Black tie dress code. Mm-hm. - With a six month wait list. - Ooh, I like it. - Liv... - You know, I... Sorry. Go ahead. When I first came here, I wasn't sure what I was gonna find. But now I can't imagine being anywhere else. With anyone else. You challenge me. You are so unapologetically yourself. I mean, even though you have terrible taste in salt. You helped me, like you really helped me remember who I am and I love making food. It makes people happy, it doesn't just wow them. I was sad when you left. I'm really happy you came back. I am too. And I would love to make another restaurant with you. Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing. Yeah. I could really go for a deconstructed cup of coffee right now. In a beaker? Is there any other way? Uh-huh.
