[dramatic orchestral music] [Woman] Now if you don't untie the rope, I won't kill you. [dramatic banging] [man groaning] One of us has to win, or we're both gonna die. [man groaning] [both men groaning and grunting] [man yelling] [men groaning] - [victim gagging] - [aggressor yelling] [victim gasping] [mallet scraping] [mallet clunking] [gasping] [Man] You said you would give us a head start. [Woman] 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [dramatic banging] [dramatic electronic music] [breathing heavily] Three, two, one. [Steve] Will ya? Yes. [door clicking shut] I know you haven't got long, but I called... [Rachel] Shut up, how long have you got? [Steve] Five minutes. Way too much time. Marked as mine now. No one else gets to suck my dick but you. There is something seriously, seriously wrong with you. You're so fuckin' sweaty. [laughing] I'm more efficient at cooling, that's why. [Steve] Oh yeah, that's why. Come on, we can beat our record. Oh yeah, I'll last longer than you. Standard rope-a-dope tactic, uh-huh. [Rachel] Yeah, obviously. [laughing] So much to do and no one to bug me to get it done. Three whole days on my own time. You got a deadline to meet, little missy. Just me, all alone. [Rachel laughing] Well look, if you start getting stir crazy, you got the car, go and see your mom or something. Just don't try and do a million things at once. Yeah, maybe. [Steve] Did you hear back from that thing? What, the fitness thing? [Steve] Hm. It's probably massively oversubscribed, stiff competition. [Steve] Okay, you send 'em the video they wanted? Yeah. [Steve] You send 'em your stats? - Yeah. - Stickin' to the plan? Yeah, you know I am. Well great then, quid's in, 100%. Check your emails today? No. Well, remember, it's not all about the wedding. Spoken like a true loser. [Steve chuckling] I'm winning at life, mate. [Rachel] Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick. Lovely, well, night-night. Seriously, though, you don't have to win all the time. [Rachel] Yes Steven, I know that. 'Specially at drunk chess. I fucking had you. I know, so I changed tactics, boom motherfucker. One time, you fucker. I know, and I'm gonna hold it with me forever. [phone alerting] Steven, Steven. What? [Rachel] Emily wants me to interview for her tonight at nine. Great, would you like a motivational speech? [Rachel] Yes. [clears throat] Don't fuck it up. See ya, love ya. Have fun. [dramatic electronic music] [camera shutter clicking] Uh, so fake, wanker. Okay, come on guys. Let me see you smile. [Rachel breathing heavily] [Man On TV] Can you do the real thing? [Rachel] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Blah blah blah. Okay, so get your sandbag or your make-shift sand bag So, up and over the head, up in front, and lunge. [exhaling] Make sure you keep your knees at the same angle as your ankle, and swap. That's it. Now if you wanna make it really difficult, pull your sandbag over your head, and lunge it out. Back together, lunge it out and see what you can do - on one leg. - [cans from bag clunking] Another leg, and hop. 10 on one leg, 10 on the next. Oh. [sighing] So sweaty. [light, upbeat music] [water splattering] Oh, woo. Hi Rachel, Emily here. [Rachel muffled by upbeat music and water splattering] I'm all right, I'm ready to go. [camera clicking] Look what you left behind, you stupid twat. No, um, stop looking at other men, come home and fuck my tits off. That's a bad joke. [ringing] Shit, "Don't fuck up," good advice. Game face on. [Emily] It is gonna be such an intense day. Intense. We're looking for a rookie to mold, someone who's in the place of the audience, basically, learning from us. - Yeah, sure. - Ruby here is gonna take you through a few examples. I don't know if you've seen any of my workout videos before but they are pretty hard core, I'm not gonna lie. They are, aren't they? And so basically I'm gonna be taking you through some strength stuff, some toning, building muscle, - getting the girl bangs - [Rachel chuckling] looks going on. I've worked with Emily once before, I have to tell you, it got so many views, she came as a guest on my channel and basically we found out that she couldn't hit for shit. Yeah, it was embarrassing, wasn't it? Not gonna lie on old Emily here. Probably something to do with the old age and arthritis, about a 10 year age gap between us. She's struggling to keep up, - aren't you Emily? - All right, all right, she's mental, okay? So, the whole point of the video is showcasing a supplement straight from the sponsor of the video. So, we're gonna start with that, and then once we get that out of the way, we can have some fun. Okay, it's gonna be cool, and it's gonna be sexy. It's gonna be motivating. Nice, I mean, you should've seen some of the other girls we interviewed, it was embarrassing. It's like, someone needs to tell them that this is serious business and we only want people that actually look the part, obviously. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. [Ruby] Yeah? So um, are you up for it? Yes. Great, and I don't know if you've been watching my videos but I like to keep things quite light. But this is serious stuff for me. I need to be taken seriously. [Ruby claps] Yeah. Great, well, I'll see ya tomorrow then? - 6:30 a.m. okay? - Sharp. Yes, yeah great. [Emily] I'll send you the details now then. Wicked! - All right, bye. - Okay, thank you, bye. [upbeat eletronic music] [dart splatting] Fucked it! Two million followers can't be wrong. Bullseye. And you wonder why people don't take you seriously. [phone beeping] Come on. [groaning] [yelling] Jesus freak. You can do this. Huh, okay. [synth music] [Emily] Yeah? Is that good? Well, yeah, that's uh, embarrassing. Watch and learn. [grunting] Ah-ha. Yep, freak. Ph.D can wait, they want me in the video. [sighing] [marble clinking] And the crowd goes wild. - [wind whipping] - [birds chirping] So, I thought we'd start with a hero shot of the supplement, you know, make it really over the top, slow motion, get it outta the way. Yeah, the suggested order only makes sense, so. [Emily] Right. Time to eat, time to grow. [Pete] What the fuck is that? Blended chicken breast and spinach, do you want some? No thank you, I've got a bacon roll in my bag. Pass me the supps, I better try it. [sighing] I've got to grow. [Emily] Thank you. Younger generation hot on my heels. Yeah, tell me about it. There's a girl in Brazil, 16, she's already twice my size. She got 10 million followers. It's crazy sponsors, big business. You've gotta grow, it's the way it's going. It makes you look like a slut but, fuck it, money in the bank at the end of the day. How do you compete with that? Just do your own thing. Or beat them at their own game. Let me share, oh fuck's sake, no signal. Right, 60K likes I've got in about an hour. Action, reaction. It's geek fodder, if you're hot, flaunt it. You should come and do some behind the scenes on the next shoot, Pete. Not sure what my girlfriend would have to say about that. Oh, make her jealous. She doesn't take kindly to slutty airheads. Physics degree wasn't paying the rent, mate. I'm only here to steal Emily's followers anyway. I thought you were suppose to be motivating people to live a healthy and active lifestyle, no? It's a nice sentiment, we need to sell, Pete. Sell the lifestyle while reminding the competition that we're the fucking best, [sniffling] and hot. How is it? It's not bad. Wait, hold still. Pete, can you get some of this? - [alarm ringing] - [solemn electronic music] Fuck. Physics degree? Yeah, I'm not just a pretty face. Nope, rich, smart, whatever. [Pete muttering] Hey, just so we're clear, this is my thing. You're just the window dressing. I'm the one with two million followers, and the contract. So, I'd just like to make sure we're both on the same page. - Wow. - This is just a strategic partnership, okay? I didn't ask for it, it was a prerequisite of the filming conditions today. They asked for you, not me. So the people that paid you to be here asked for me specifically, and now you think it prudent to threaten me. I'm not threatening you, I'm just reminding you of the arrangement. And I want you to stop with all your little digs at me, okay, they're not funny. Oh, have I hit a nerve? I can read between the lines, your time is over. Between the ones on your face, actually. You can't stay on top forever. Two million followers. Half probably paid for but, yeah, you have got that plain girl touch that people do seem to go for. Rather that than whatever the people see in you. Excuse me? Fuck. Look, I [clears throat] I'm just under a lot of pressure to perform, okay, all the time. Mm-hmm. And, I'm sorry. Let's just make today work, yeah? I was only taking the piss 'cause I thought you could take it. Oh yeah, well I have my off days. It's okay, threaten me again, and I'll not be so polite. All right? Hi everyone, I'm Grace. Hello, this isn't everyone, we're still waiting on one more. Peter. So you must be the sponsor for today. Do you own all this land? Mm, yep, 490 hectares of it. Wow. Right, we should get started then. [Ruby] Don't you wanna wait? No, we've got a lot to fit in, and not a lot of daylight. I'll tell you what, I'll take you to the clearing and then I'll come back and wait for the straggler while you're settin' up, all right? That's great. - Okay. - Thanks. [Grace] Have you tried the supplement? Yeah, I've just had some in the car, it's great. I'm gonna save the rest for on camera. [Grace] Good good. You uh, look a lot smaller in real life. [Emily] Yeah, everyone says that. This place is amazing. All this land. Should try and get some use out of it. Had a problem with poachers for awhile so it wasn't safe. Then I tried renting it to campers and to paintballers, they all made a mess. Now well, you guys. Well what put the idea into your head? [Grace] A new neighbor, city type. He's an entrepreneur, owns the other farm next to mine. Wants in on the fitness game, hence the drink. And that's, that's Jeff? Yep, Jeff. Little bit double dutch to me. Said you're famous online or something. Uh, yeah, something like that. [chuckles] [Grace] Well, did well to snag you then, didn't he? Needs a nice face, sell his products I suppose. [Emily] Oh, you're too kind. [laughing] [Grace] So, what is it you actually do then? [Ruby] She prances around in her underwear doing fitness videos. [Grace] People like that, do they? No, I motivate people to get fit. Yeah, so fit. Says she who just showed me a half-naked picture of herself. I would offer to help Pete, but it looks like you could do with the exercise. I prefer to embrace my awesomeness and motivate, show off my physical being as a big fuck you to all the fat lady turd burgers and the haters. Oh yeah. Here, let me motivate you. All right, you can stop lookin', Pete. What would your girlfriend say? #GreenEyedMonster. [chuckling] [light electronic music] Can I just give you these? Uh, yeah. Such a large area, I'd rather you wear them, just in case. [Emily] Yeah, no worries. Fuck. Cheers. All right, I'll be back later to see how you're gettin' on. Soon as the other one gets here, I'll send her your way. That's great, thank you. All right, um, [clears throat], we should get started. [gearshift clicking] They've gone without you. What? I'm assuming you're with the others. The fanatical fitness types. Yeah. [Grace] Don't worry, I have instructions for you. Well when did they set off? About an hour ago. They got fed up with waiting. I'm gonna lock you all in, make sure no one disturbs your shoot. Oh, give you this. [Grace sighing] All right, okay. Tracks your stats, apparently. It'll make sure I can find you, despite your camouflage. Make sure you're not slacking off. Come on. Right, it's either left or right as it forks. You might wanna take the right fork, it's easier. Especially playing catch-up. They'll be at the clearing, it's about four miles. Paths eventually loop round anyway. [clears throat] You look a bit fragile to be out here. Don't mean any offense. No, it's fine, I'm stronger than I look. Well, not quite like the other girls. Hard to beat them. Well. Like I said, easy route would be best for you, I think. Have you done both? It's my land so I know it. Grace, by the way. Nice to meet you. [somber electronic music] Enjoy it then. The others set off at quite a pace, so you'll have to go some to catch up. Okay. Fuck. Take the right fork, it's easier. Fuck it, okay. [inhaling] Oh, fuck. Oh, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine. I'm, I'm fine. I didn't ask. You just trying to get some attention right now or is it your time of the month? [Emily] No, and no. Well whatever you're doing, if you're taking a piss it's not gonna work. Look, will you just give me a minute, please. But Emily, I am the best makeup artist, I need to check the torso. Only the best person is allowed on the camera. Stop it. [laughing] Where is that little minion, by the way? She better be coming. Don't know, it's a massive opportunity, she'd be stupid to miss it, can you... Pete are you getting any of this? It's good content. All right, you can get off now. No, no, no, you've gotta try and get yourself out. Stop, now stop, stop being a twat. Come on. [Emily grunting] Oh! All right. Jeez. [Pete] Can you stop fannying about? Yeah, let's crack on, please. [Ruby] All right. [Rachel] You all right, do you need a hand? Oh yeah, please. Here, take this. I'm afraid I'm a little heavy. That's fine, I got it. [both grunting] There, ah. - [Jonjo grunting] - [Rachel breathing heavily] [Rachel] Good? That's harder than it looks. That's what she said. [Jonjo groaning] I must be lost. I, I really don't know the place, I wish I could help. That's all right. I'll figure it out. Oh, you haven't seen a couple of girls and a camera guy go past here? No, no, sorry. Shit, um, I must be really behind. Okay, I'm gonna dash. [mysterious electronic music] [branch cracking] [Rachel crying out in pain] [wincing painfully] [ominous ambient music] [Rachel crying and groaning] [breathing heavily] [ominous ambient music] [Rachel coughing] [Rachel groaning] [Rachel crying out] [groaning] [GPS beeping] Hm. Yeah, Jeff wants in on the fitness game. As if Jeff's a real person. Fucking clowns. [Rachel crying out] [Rachel gasping] [Rachel groaning] [Rachel crying out] - [birds chirping] - [wind whipping] [Pete] Action. [Ruby] Slo-mo, Pete. And do a couple normal speed. [Pete] Yep. So gay. Fuck you. Corporate whore. Sell out. - Mm. - All right, we can cut now. Come on, slow coach. [somber piano music] Help me, my leg. [Grace] It's okay, it's okay. Could you not hear me calling? [Grace] Oh, you'd be surprised how much the trees absorb. Oh god, uh. I came looking for you when the other, others said they'd not seen you. I thought you must've got lost, so I turned on my device. Ooh. Ah, oh, this thing helped me find you. - [Grace grunting] - [Rachel wincing] - Please. - Sometimes this is too easy. What? Just breathe, okay. Count down from 10. Now, hold on, the pain will subside. I'll help you. [Rachel crying out] 10, nine. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, - one. [grunting] - [bone cracking] I told you to take the other path. I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine. You're gonna be first today. I was just going to get my tools. Good timing, really. [Rachel thudding] [chuckles] Scratch one. [spitting] Too easy. You good? [Ruby] Yeah. It's so cold. You ready, Pete? Yeah, I'm cool, yeah, I'll just pan to Ruby as you finish. Uh, do you wanna do that Ruby, or should be just have you enter frame. Let's just have me enter. Yeah, yeah, I agree, I think it's stronger. You know, like unity, togetherness. Just make sure she's out of focus. [Pete] Yeah. Yeah, uh-huh, I heard that. Should we include the hazardous weirdo landowner? [Pete] Shut up. [Ruby] How much is she paying you? I hope it's a lot. You know, we should actually be getting hazardous weirdo pay. Oh, she's only here to perv on us. Girls, shall we just get to it. Right. I'm gonna give you all a head start today. What is she talking about? [chuckling] I think she's a bit dim. What is that in her hand? [Grace] Can you humor me a minute? Okay, Pete, do you wanna cut? [Pete] I'm not cutting, come on, we got stuff to do. I'd just like to see if you can break me. It's a game I like to play. Nice to have company. I can't play alone. What is it? It's a bit like hide and seek. Except if I find you, then I kill you. [Emily] What? - She's fucking with us. - Don't say that. [Pete] That's crazy. How do we win? [Grace] Well you just have to get past me. Easy enough, what do we get if we win? Well you get to live. That's why I invited you all here. I want a new challenge. You look tough, but are you? [Pete groaning] Look, Ruby. Look, girls, girls look, come on, stop. [Ruby] Let go. [Pete] Stop. [Ruby] Oh! Fuck! [Pete] Oh, Jesus Christ. Like I said, 10 seconds, come on, hero. [Grace grunting] - [Ruby groaning] - Fucking hell. I'm not joking! Nine, eight. Run Pete, fucking run. [Grace] Five, four. [Ruby] What the hell! [Pete] Oh, shit! [Emily] Get outta here, Pete. [eerie music] [Pete] Emily, run! Show me you're worth the money! One. Fuck, fuck. [tense mysterious electronic music] Shit. [knife thudding] [Pete groaning] - [knife thudding] - [Pete groaning] Fuck! [Pete crying out] Fuck, get the fuck off me, bitch! Fuck off. [groaning] - [Grace crying out] - [thudding] - You messed up my face. - [Grace grunting] [Pete gasping] [both grunting] [Pete groaning] [Pete gagging] Broken already? [Pete gasping] Where're you going? [Grace breathing heavily] Not game over yet. [eerie ambient music] [Rachel gasping] [breathing heavily] [Rachel groaning and wincing] [Rachel crying out] [Rachel crying out] [Rachel crying out] [Rachel breathing heavily] [Emily coughing] [Emily gasping] Oh fuck, come on. Fuck, fuck. Oh. [coughing] [groaning lightly] [Rachel groaning] [Rachel crying out] Yeah, yes. [Rachel groaning lightly] - [brach cracking] - [Rachel crying out painfully] [Rachel crying] [mysterious music] [Rachel groaning] [groaning] [breathing heavily] [camera beeping] - [dramatic banging] - [woman crying out] - Shit. - Get off me! Get off me. [Pete] Stop! [muffled static on camera] Fuck, fuck. [Rachel groaning and shuddering] Come on. [Rachel groaning] [Rachel crying out] [Rachel groaning] [deep rumbling] [Pete gasping] [Pete shuddering] - [Grace grunting] - [Pete groaning] [Rachel crying] [Pete gasping] [Grace grunting] [Pete groaning and gasping] [ominous buzzing] [Rachel crying] [ominous banging] [rod thudding] [Grace grunting and groaning] [breathing heavily] Two down. Ah, one coming this way. [Rachel shuddering] [GPS beeping] [Rachel shuddering] [Ruby] Pete, Pete. You can't help him. You're brave though, I'll give you that. Still think you're tough? You look a lot tougher than me. Looks can be deceiving sometimes. Well I can't play the game and win if you cheat. Best thing about this game, I make the rules. Well I've never lost anything. You think I've got where I am by submission? Well I'm better than you, faster than you, stronger than you. I can't wait to see you prove it. Which part of you should I break first? [Rachel panting] [Ruby grunting] - [stick thudding] - [Grace grunting] [Ruby gasping] [Ruby crying out] [deep somber music] [Ruby crying out] You don't know how to quit, do ya? You, I'm gonna make suffer. Let's go get your friend. [Ruby gasping] I'll go get her and make her watch. Be a great video for your social media. Don't go anywhere. Thought you lot would be a challenge. [Ruby coughing] Emily! She's coming! Think you can beat me. [chuckling] She can wait. Wirey fuck won't get far. I'm pretty sure you're already beaten. [Ruby coughing] I'll be honest, I thought you'd be more of a challenge. Your friend though, she's a slippery little bitch. Fucking fast too. I want you to call her name, ask for help. Do that and I'll make it quick. See if she can be courageous. I doubt it. Come on then. [coughing] Come closer. Call her name. No. [Ruby grunting] [mallet thudding] I'm disappointed. Still haven't met anyone up to my standards, at my level. [Ruby coughing] Come on. Better than me. [eerie banging] Faster than me. [eerie banging] Stronger than me. [eerie banging] You don't wanna go that way. Fuck you. [Ruby wincing in pain] - [mallet thudding] - [Grace grunting] Please. Is that you admitting defeat? [Ruby] Yes. Thought so. Say her name. Call out for her. Emily! - [knife thudding] - [Ruby gagging] No prizes for second place. [sighing] [eerie music] Anyone? Anyone there? Hello. Hello. Help me. Fucking trespassers. Fucking winner takes all. That fucking does it, come on. [Grace yelling] Come on, Grace, come on, come on. [Grace grunting] Hello! [grunting] [Jonjo grunting] You weren't even invited. Throwing a spanner in the works. Did you not read the signs that said no trespassing? - [fence sizzling] - [Jonjo yelling] [Jonjo groaning] [GPS beeping] How is that supplement? [Emily groaning] Help, help. [tense adventurous music] Run. Hide. [Emily gasping] Fuck. Next one's in your brain. Uh! [tense, adventurous music] Oh, what the fuck. [Rachel groaning] [breathing heavily] ♪ If you go down to the woods today ♪ ♪ Be sure you're going to die ♪ [eerie music] [Rachel groaning] [dramatic swishing] [Rachel panting] [Rachel groaning] [GPS beeping] [scoffing] Surely you can't be that fucking stupid. [tense, somber music] [GPS beeping] [Emily groaning] [swishing] [Emily yelling] [car door clicking open] [Rachel grunting] Fuck. [car engine turning over] Fuck. - [bone cracking] - [engine revving] [Rachel yelling] [Rachel panting] [Rachel yelling] [Steve] Filming you in secret. Secret messages. If you find this, I may be dead. Nah, not really. Look, look, look, look, look, look, look. I can't believe your passcode is one, two, three, four. [laughing] Now just remember, doesn't always have to be you against the world. Might feel like it sometimes but, I am on your side. You are allowed to ask for help, it's not against the laws. [laughing] See you in the morning. [breathing heavily] Billy, I know you might not see this, so I think not, but I thought I'd leave it just in case. I've just seen some people die. Some of the team that I didn't even get a chance to meet. Beaten to death by the landowner. I'm next, I'm sure of it. This isn't a joke. I broke my leg. [dramatic orchestral music] I'm fucked. You don't die of a broken fucking leg, but I can't get away. I'm in so much pain. I don't know what to do. I wish you were here, or mum. She'd know what to do. [Rachel crying] Must be my lucky day. [ominous music] Where do you think you're going? - [arrow thudding] - [Jonjo grunting] [Grace grunting and yelling] I wondered where you'd gone to. - [car door banging] - [Grace yelling] [car door thudding repeatedly] [Grace grunting] [Grace laughing] Don't you go anywhere. I haven't explained the rules to you yet. Hold that thought. Hiya, what's happened to you then? My leg. It'll be all right, we'll get you some help. Yeah, Steve, you have to listen to me please. [Steve] It's okay. No, no it's not all right. She'll be back, she's killing everyone. No, you're okay, you're okay. Your mind's just playing tricks on you. [Rachel] Listen. It's all right, we'll get you to a hospital, okay? I'll drive the car for ya. 'Cause you can't, can ya? [chuckling] I can't believe you found me. Wait, wait, how did you find me? [Rachel grunting and groaning] [Rachel crying out] [car engine turning over] [car engine revving] Come on. [car engine revving] Come on, come on. Help me, help. [crying] Help me, please, please, help me. No, help me! [crying] [ominous music] [Rachel crying] Now if you don't untie the rope, I won't kill you. Look, poachers, missing hikers, happy campers, family business. Lots of team building that weekend. Paintballers, few weekends back. Why me? A champion of women, a role model. Thought you'd offer me up a challenge for once. Strong girls like you two. Been watching your videos. After all your recent embarrassments, I'd imagine you've got a point to prove. So, I've got a new game for you. One of you will survive this. But first, out with the old. Why are you doing this? I just don't like people. All alone after my father died. Left alone with my thoughts. Until one day, my fence alarm goes off. Poachers, come into my territory. Gave me a purpose. Set me against others. See who comes out on top. [Jonjo groaning] Still with us? Three's a crowd. No less than you deserve after giving me the runaround. [Grace yelling] [Emily crying] [Grace breathing heavily] Ah, will you look at that. Wow, well, nothing lasts forever. [mallet handle clattering] Don't go anywhere. [Grace grunting] We can get out of this. She's won. We can't just give up. She's offering one of us a chance to survive. That's gonna be me. Don't be stupid. We can get out of this if we work together. Just refuse to do what she says. You're already dead. So, my new game, we're not playing hide and seek anymore. This time, who kills, wins. No. I've survived this long. She's toying with us. I must face the best. So the winner out of you two must face me. Be nice to watch for a change. Come on. [keys jiggling] Your keys to freedom. I've parked the car just outside. [car locks clicking] Come on, prove you're the best. Young upstarts want a piece? Well fuck them! I won't fight. Then you'll die. Why are you doing this? She's lying. Shut up and fight me. [Rachel panting] Do you need some convincing? Okay, okay, okay. [Rachel crying out in pain] [tense music] [Emily yelling] Get off, get off. No! Winner! You might wanna check she's dead. She's gone. Ah, feel good? [Emily] Yeah. [Grace] Good to crush the competition? Yeah. Isn't it just? [both grunting] 10, nine, eight, I knew you'd be tough to beat. I win again. My game, my rules. I'm gonna break every piece of you. And enjoy every second.
