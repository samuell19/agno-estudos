VALLEBY PRISON Lassemajas Detective Agency THE SCORPION ENIGMA Hello? No! No! Hello! Let me out! Kids! Don't go near that scorpion. It's not good! - What, is it dangerous? - Yes. The most dangerous and poisonous of them all. See the sting there? It can wreak havoc. - Is it really sensible to have something so toxic in Valleby? - Of course it is! It's the best guard dog I've ever had. It stays awake all night, it's good at hiding, and it attacks at lightning speed! Sorry. Yes, sorry. Yes. No burglar would dare come back here. - What does Ivy want? - Oh! Listen, it's time. We have to go to the square. Come on, kids. Hurry! - My dear, dear, dear Valleby residents! Three days from now is the big day! That's when our beloved city reaches— 500 years! This year fireworks, carousels, chocolate wheels hot dogs and sweets will be— completely free! Free Valleby, 500 years. See you again in three days for Valleby 500! He's been depressed for several weeks now. - Come on. Let's go and talk to him. - Hey, Randolf! - Hello, kids. - How's it going? - Not very good, actually. - Why? Has something happened? - Yes. Well, no. Not really. I just feel so lonely. - You could put a personal ad in Vallebybladet. Maybe you'll find someone and really fall in love. - I wouldn't dare! Nah. 'Once a bachelor, always a bachelor', as my old mother used to say. - You were born in February, right? - Yes. It's a very long time until my birthday. - So you're a—an Aquarius. Okay. Today's horoscope. 'Today the path of Aquarius is crossed by Pluto.' 'It's time for big emotions. A meeting with the love of your life is just around the corner.' - You see? Today's your day! - Sigge Jansson invented that to sell newspapers. - You could start at Ramon's dance school. - Good idea! Everyone falls in love there. Well, dancing isn't my thing. I can't even floss. How—? No! Hello there! It's one-way here! It's one-way here. - Oh, forgive me, Commissioner. I'm late for the party committee meeting. I must have gone the wrong way. - This kind of thing usually leads to hefty fines, you know. Can I see your driving licence? - Of course. - Irina Kovalenko. Your birthday is on Valleby Day itself. - I don't usually celebrate my birthday. - Wait a minute. Is that alcohol? - What? - Have you been drinking? - What, this? No no, this is a gift. I haven't had a drop. You can see for yourself! Yes, come closer. A little more. A little more. And a little bit more. You know what? We can forget about this little—incident, OK? - Thank you, you are kind. Yes, Well—I'll be on my way now, then. - Yes— Hello! It's one-way here! Yes, hello! There you are. What? - Irina's single too. - You think so? - Commissioner— Yes? Yes, it was serious. Yes I understand. Yes. We'll be there right away. That was the Academy of Science. They've had a break-in. I can't believe my finest telescope is gone. German mechanism and lenses all the way from China. It was completely unique. - Yes, it's truly terrible. But don't worry. The world's best detective agency will solve this. - Yes, I hope so. So stupid that I never saw the burglar! It happened so quickly. - It's not that easy. Especially if you're locked up. - We're done. Shall we go? - Oh wait! There's one more thing you have to look at. All this paint. - Paint? This isn't good. The party starts in three days and now we've got a mysterious burglar to deal with. No, people will be worried. Luckily the newspapers haven't caught wind of this. - Why did the burglar want a telescope? - To look at the stars, maybe? What do you think this means? Maybe the burglar's name starts with M? - No. It's a sign. A zodiac sign. The Scorpion? - This reminds me of Lillie Ragnarsson's time. - Lillie Ragnarsson? Who's that? - Valleby's worst burglar of all time. I was just a little boy, but I remember it like it was yesterday. Night after night she struck. Emptied the bank of money, the church of silver, the museum of paintings. Until in the end people didn't dare go out. I had to sleep in my mother's bed for weeks. And every time she struck, she painted a sign of the zodiac at the scene. And then she disappeared without a trace, just like that. In the end they caught her, somewhere in Brazil, I think. Thankfully, she's locked up now. Yes! But that was a long time ago. Don't think about it any more. - Wait! We can get off here. We'll walk the last bit. Hello? Let us out? - What? Oh—yeah, yeah. Maybe the burglar was born nder the sign of Scorpio. - Or just copying the zodiac villain Lillie. - Wait a sec. Last night a truck full of sweets was stolen here on Valleby square. So someone's made off with all the free sweets. An absolutely ruthless burglar. So it's just such a total disaster. Everyone's like: 'Shit! What's really going on?' I brewed it myself, actually. I'll go in and talk to Lasse and Maja, see what they say about the sweets. - What are you doing? - Hello, hello! You can't pass the barrier! - I'll be super quick. Hello! Have you found any candy yet? - No, just this card. - And what's that? - The zodiac sign Scorpio. That's all we know. - Hold on—So you haven't even found— anything like a little jelly mouse or something— What's it called? Kind of like a lump of butter, right? Nothing like that? OK. Yes. All the candy—that was free—is— still free but stolen as well, so it's gone. So—now we don't know if Valleby Day will happen. And to find out more about it, follow me on my channel. Look for the Swish link there, so—so go for it. You can stop now. You're so slow. You have to be faster. You are super slow. It's like you're all in slow-motion. - Well, Randolf, one thing vwe thought of. That Lillie Ragnarsson—what prison is she in? - Why? - And how long was her sentence? Are you sure it's here? - Yes, it's here. It's— Lillie moved here after her release. And she was released for— 'for humanitarian reasons', it says. - Why? - I don't know. - Some illness maybe. - Don't you understand what this means? Lillie comes back to Valleby, and suddenly the burglaries start again. - It must be her. - We'll go and check. Are you going to let us out? - Hello, Randolf! - What? Oh, yeah, Sorry. Kids! This could be dangerous. Best if I go in first. - Are you sure? - Step aside so I don't hurt you. There's no danger! I'm a policeman. You can carry on with you coffee. - Lillie is in her room. She doesn't hang out here very often. She doesn't like people. That's probably what happens when you've been in prison for so many years. She's all alone. Not even the daughter visits. She can be a little bad-tempered. Don't get too close. Okay? Lilie? You have visitors! - Hello, Lill— - No! Don't call me that! 'Lillie.' Sounds like an old cow. No! Say Ragnarsson instead. Yes. I didn't think I'd run into someone like you again. Police fart! And you've brought LasseMaja's Detective Agency too. A brave cop! So this very brave cop's brought along his very own tiny little cops. Well? Out with it, then. What have I done now? - When—when did Vagnarsson come back to Ralleby? At least, I mean— - It was probably a few—weeks ago. Can't someone please poison that choir? I hate them! Yes, well—what was Ragnarsson doing last night? And the night before that? Yes, Ragnarsson wasn't exactly disco dancing. Because Ragnarsson was lying in that bed in this wretched place! If you don't believe me, you can ask one of the staff. - Sorry to disturb you. Come on, kids, let's go. - No wait. There's a burglar in town imitating you. What do you know about it? - I heard something about that on the news. A lousy copycat, this 'Scorpion'. Come up with something yourselves instead! - Do you know how he thinks? What he wants? - What he wants, I don't know. However, I know exactly how a serial burglar thinks. This is me in my glory days. This is the robbery at Valleby Savings Bank. This is the fourth time I've been caught. These are my zodiac signs, my favourite signs. Oh, those were the days. - Why did you paint different zodiac signs? - Because a serial burglar is not just someone who commits more and more crimes. You might say he's a bit of an artist. Each burglary is part of a larger work of art. And if you crack that enigma—then— then you can find out who the real villain is. But—that's not something for two kids playing detectives. For that you need a real expert. - Hold on though! Look at this. Scorpio zodiac sign. At the Academy of Science and in the square—both crime scenes. A telescope and a truckload of sweets have disappeared. - Interesting! You do realize that this serial burglar has only just started? - Just started? But Valleby Day is in two days. - If you were to ask me, I'd say that party is in real danger. - We need to find out the birthday of everyone in Valleby. The burglar must have been born under Scorpio. - Why would you do that? There'll be thousands. - I have to speak to the committee. Increase security. I'll do it right away. Bye. - This will never be solved. That's what I can hear. - No, you do it. - No, you. - Okay then. - Err, Lillie? - What did you say? - Ragnarsson—would you consider giving us a little help with the investigation? - Me? Not on your life! I'm an old burglar lady, not a detective. - But you could help us solve the enigma of Scorpio. - We really do need an expert. - And also, you get to go out a little too. Lillie, wait! Your medication! - Drive, drive, drive! - Now hold on, Lillie! - Now this old convict lady is going on an adventure! Bye-bye, nutjobs! Go for it! We can't stand the fuss there. We're outside. So much fuss otherwise. - No, I can't take it any more. - It's all right. I'll drive. - Now you'll have to move, old men! - I'm so tired of old men! Ugh! I'm so glad I don't have one any more. Come on. What else do we know about our Scorpio? Both burglaries took place in the middle of the night. Aha! Then our burglar must be very tired during the day. So, look out for someone who's half-asleep all the time. What else? - He uses white paint and fire. - White paint and fire—more? - He's good at climbing and interested in the stars. - Stars? Good! Drive on! Fishy guy, this Muhammed Karat! He seems—he seems to like scorpions! - But why would Muhammed want to destroy Valleby Day? - Scorpio's zodiac sign is a letter M. Maybe it's him. We'll keep an eye on him now. Question: What do you know about that sign? - Not so much. - No? Then we'll find out now. - To the library! - It's actually that way. - That's what I said. I know that perfectly well. To the library! But my God, Barbro, this is a scandal! EMERGENCY MEETING! DO NOT DISTURB! These are trifles! Trifles! - Who are all these people? - Valleby Day party committee. On the front, I have made a protocol— Barbro Palm, Irina Kovalenko, the minister, Ramon Persson, and the Commissioner. A sleepy person. What should we do? - Is that— - Paint? Can't we do something fun in church instead? Read a prayer together. - That's out of the question! I think we should be at my campsite. Campsite? - Yes, my campsite! I can bring my fine china and strawberry wine. Everyone can have potatoes and grilled guinea pig. - And I can teach everyone to salsa. - But everyone has to pay for themselves. - No! Everything should be free! Valleby's turning 500! - Shouldn't we just cancel it all? Birthdays are so overrated. - So do we have to celebrate this at all? What does the Commissioner say? - What about a tie? - What? - What? Or something? What? - You heard what the Commissioner said. We celebrate in the square with ties and everything! - That's not what he said at all! - But that's what I say! - I still think we should be in the church. - No, the campsite! - The church. - The square. - No, the campsite! - How many stitches? - It varies depending on what I'm knitting. - Campsite! - Church! - Order! We mustn't let everyone down. Valleby Day is celebrated in the square just as usual. I have decided that! Thank you all for working so well together. - And what—what are you people up to? - This is actually a library. - You don't hush me. I'm the librarian here. So I'm the one who sets the rules! - Do you need to do a wee-wee? - Hi Karin! We were just wondering if you had a book on Scorpio. - The star sign, that is. I have no less than eleven books. - Perfect! We'll have them all. - Well, no, that's not possible. They're on loan. - All at the same time? - But there's one here! - Yes, but it's reserved. - Can't we look at it for a while? - Certainly not! What would it look like if people looked in other borrowers' books? - Now, I've heard many stupid things, butthat's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. Madame Librarian, I wonder— Do you have number five in this very fine series about the Thirty Years' war? - Number five? - Yes. - I have it. It's in the history department, just round the corner. Just round here, actually, so you have— - Would Madame Librarian push me over there now? - Yes of course. - Oh thank you. 'Scorpio is one of twelve signs of the zodiac. A fire burns in Scorpio.' '... interest in mysteries and dark secrets.' 'Corpion.' That's the name of the person who ordered the book. - Is there a first name? - No, just an S. 'S. Corpion.' S. Corpion— - The Scorpion! - The Scorpion! Does it say where the Scorpion lives? - No. - Phone number? - No. Nothing. It's Corpion that has every single book about the Scorpion. And also— - 'The Scorpion's Deadly Venom'. - Oh no! Books about real scorpions! Lasse, watch out! Look! - No. If everyone just does as I say, everything will be fine. - Hi, kids! So you're here too? - Yes? - We've had an extraordinary meeting. Irina was there as well. - Ah! Have you had a chance to talk? - Yes, yes. I think so. I'm completely giddy. This'll never work! - 'Course it will! Just be yourself. It'll be great. But who am I? What should I do? Vallebybladet's new horoscope! It must be in by now. I have to run. Bye! Move over, old man, or I'll run over your ugly shoes! - Ouch! What are you doing? - How did it go? - Not so good. At least, we haven't found anything new. - Right. So what you have to do now is focus and be patient, because it'll come off soon. I know. - Although— - Don't say anything. Look, she's listening. The library's closing now for today! You're welcome to come again tomorrow. We open at 09.47. So, off you go! I'm off to a course. - Wait, Lasse. Maybe you could set up a surveillance camera here. Sooner or later, Scorpio has to get his book. - Good idea! Then we'll catch them— Maja! It's gone! - What? The Scorpion must have been here! - Has the Scorpion been here? - Yes, he's taken the book! - Out, fast! Go, detectives! Hurry! - Come on, Lasse! - Shit books! Keep them. - Gone. - Well? - No, he's gone. - Yeah, same shit. We'll find him somehow. Good. Right, let's go. I want to get home. I don't want to be late for visiting time. The cake was delicious. Hello, Lillie! Welcome home! - Is there a visitor for me tonight too? - No, I'm sorry. Not this time either. - Anyone called? - No, not that I know of. - Mail? - No. - Then fuck off. - Yes. We're going now, Lillie. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye! Couldn't her daughter visit sometime? - Siri? - Siri? - The name was on one of the drawings. - I wonder if she lives in Valleby. Anyway, are you coming with me to the church? I have to get my bike. I bet Scorpio strikes again tonight. He has to finish building the work of art. - It feels like we're one step behind all the time. - Yeah. Can't we catch a little luck for once? Maja, watch out! - What? - It's an A manhole cover! You know: Assassination, Atomic bomb, Algae bloom— Very creepy things! If you step on one, you'll have bad luck. - What—would it be decided in advance, or what? Assassination, Atomic bomb, Algae bloom! You see? Nothing happened. - Yeah, suit yourself. - Oh no! - What's the matter? - Why do I always have such bad luck? - That's good. Look at the paint. - The same paint Scorpio used! - And the minister had on his hand. Look at this. A scorpion! It's the books from the library! Does this mean the minister is Scorpio? - Yes, maybe. Or else someone broke in. We have to tell Lillie about this. - There's something else up here. Come on! The telescope! Maja! It's here! It's pointing to Karats Guld. - That must be the next burglary, surely? - This means Muhammad is innocent. - We're one step ahead now. When the Scorpion comes to Muhammad's shop, then— we'll arrange photographic evidence. Did you hear that? - The Scorpion! Come on! Hide! - I'll get after him. Check the telescope! - Use the walkie talkie! He ran into the cemetery! - Understood! - The northern part, by the old tombstones. Can you see anything? Over. - No, what about you? South exit, Lasse! Running towards the water! - The Scorpion's at the port! Hurry up! Where am I going now? I think we lost them. Over. - No, he has to be here somewhere. Take a closer look. On top of the containers! - Which one? - A brown one. - There's any number of them! - Container B2. I repeat: Container B2. He's climbed down through a hatch in the roof. - Lasse, I've found it. I'm at the container. - Maja, wait. This doesn't feel safe. We need reinforcements. I have to turn the radio off. Scorpio can hear me. Over and out. - No, Maj— No, Maja! Don't go down there. No no no! Maja! Maja, are you there? - I can't get out. You have to help me! - I'm coming! Lasse! - Where's Scorpio? - Gone. It's just Valleby Day's fireworks in there. Can you hear that? - Run! What's this piece of paper? Minutes of Meeting. It's from the emergency meeting at the library. - Scorpio must have dropped it. Look. It says where the fireworks are. It must be someone on the party committee. - Of course. Barbro Palm, the minister, Ramon— Irina Kovalenko! The Commissioner's great love. Hey, kids! I came as fast as I could. Jesus, what does this look like! - Have you got a new tie? - And hat? - What? No, I actually knitted them myself. And this too, the truncheon case. It said in the horoscope: Time to leave your old self behind and seek new energies. Yeah. So I've started knitting. - Yeah. - Cool. Who is this mean Scorpio anyway? The fireworks are the highlight of the entire Valleby Day. - What if that's the Scorpion's big plan? To destroy Valleby Day? - But—but why? Look out! Look out! What are you doing? Yeah, is Valleby's nightmare real? You have to pinch your arm to see if it is. I did that earlier, and yes, it's true. All the fireworks have been blown sky high. Will there be a Valleby Day or not? Will there be free sweets? Yes, that was all from me. And remember to Swish too. If the Scorpion doesn't like Valleby Day, it's not Barbro Palm. - No, but the other three are highly suspect. Ready, go! Hey! Come on! Good! - We've got three suspects! - And we've found the Scorpion's hiding place! And the telescope— - What's going on? - Ragnarsson isn't very well today. - Is there anything we can do? - Yes Take that blasted choir, strangle them, and flush them down the toilet! Please. No, don't mind me now. So. Can I have a full report? - We know where Scorpio intends to strike. - The Karatsguld shop. The telescope was pointed there. - Good work! You're close now. - Come on! We have to warn Muhammad. - Ragnarsson's Detective Agency has taken some time off today. I'll stay here and hold the fort. Maybe I'll have a little visit as well. Well, get going, then— You've a burglar to catch! That's cheating! Tonight? Are you sure? Lucky I have my deadly scorpion. - By the way, how much are the zodiac necklaces? - How much? You know what? You can get your own for nothing, as a thank you for all your help. - Well—actually, I need all of them. For our investigation. - Is that so— Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Scorpio—every sign of the zodiac. - Okay, and? - There are only three suspects. We find out who was born under Scorpio. Then we have the burglar. Suspect number one: Ramon Persson. Did you see how tired he was in the library? Lillie said, 'Look for someone who's half-asleep all the time.' Tranquila, tranquila, tranquila! I'm coming, I'm coming! Oh, LasseMaja! How nice! Are you here to register for my dance school? - No, actually. We're here to bring you a gift from Muhammed Karat. - A gift? Wait now! Is this a bribe for Muhammad to win the dance competition? - What? No! We— - Let me tell you—you can't bribe me! Ramon Vicente de Alcurnia Persson! You can tell that to Muhammed Karat! And by the way, I don't like silver. It should be gold. Basta! Suspect number two: the minister. The paint on his hand: The same paint Scorpio used. And then the hiding place in the church tower. Hello, children. What are you doing here? There's no service now. We have a gift for you from Muhammad Karat. I think I'll have—this one. - So you were born under Sagittarius? - No, I thought it was such a nice shape. Bye. - But what's your real— - Star sign? - Yes. - Suspect number three: Irina Kovalenko. She has the Commissioner wrapped around her little finger. He can't think of anyone else. And she was so weird in the library when she was hiding. Come on. Oh no. What's he doing here? - Hello! Welcome. Come in. - Thanks. - Hello, kids! What are you doing here? - Nothing special. How about you? - Well, I'm—doing a bit of scouting, you might say. - Are those new trousers? - Yep. Sweater too? - Yep. I'm making a sash as well. It says: 'If I keep on the same track, the reward will come.' I think that's what it says. I don't understand what all the planets mean. I have to read everything here again. Stop believing in that bloody horoscope and make your own life choices. - No, the stars are always right. I have to follow them. - But you don't believe in horoscopes. - Yes! I certainly do! I met the love of my life, just like it said. - Look at this. Jansson moves the different horoscopes around to the different zodiac signs. Yesterday, Aquarius was supposed to find the love of his life. Today it's Scorpio. - Do you understand what that means? - Yes! That it's all just make-believe. - It means Irina will also meet the love of her life. She was born under Scorpio. What should we do? - I don't know. Maybe Ramon and the minister were born under Scorpio too. We'll know tonight. We'll let him figure it out for himself, shall we? - Hey, Randolf? We know where Scorpio's going to strike tonight. - That's great! Now I have the chance to be a hero. Irina will think I'm very brave. That's amazing, kids! Are you in place outside? Over. - I certainly am! Over. He's here! Where's he gone? The square, Lasse! - Scorpio is in the square. I repeat: Scorpio is in the square. - Come on, Maja! - Understood. Where's the Commissioner? Have you seen the Scorpion? - At the hot dog stand. Okay. Stay here. I'll deal with it. Should we help him? - I think he wants to deal with it himself. Come on! Are you all right? Scorpio sign. - Hello? Is anyone there? - Come out! - We know you're there. Hands up! - Kimmy? - It wasn't me. I'm innocent. Congratulations to you two! You've outsmarted a true serial burglar. Not bad for a pair of toddlers. - We'd never have made it without you. - No. I know that. To think it was that sluggish TV man! But what was the work of art? And what was the answer to Scorpio's enigma? - Kimmy wanted more viewers on his channel. - He made up the whole story to get attention. - Oh my! And tomorrow the whole of Valleby will celebrate thanks to you two. - By the way, have you heard anything from Siri? - There you go. Hey, wake up! - What is it? - Scorpio has struck again! - What? - Yes! Come on! - But Kimmy was locked up. - All night. - Then he's innocent. Find anything? I don't get it. The diamond necklace is still there. What exactly has been stolen? - Where's the scorpion? Yes, this is Valleby TV. Breaking news with me about Scorpio and all that. It obviously wasn't me who was the Scorpion. Here comes Barbro Palm. I'll ask her. - Dear Valleby residents, thank you for coming. - Move! Did you think—? Silence! Everyone, be quiet now. - Did you think it was me? - Not now, Kimmy! - Did you think I did it? - Hush! Dear residents of Valleby. It is with great, great sadness that I am forced to announce— that Valleby Day is cancelled. - What? A dangerous, deadly scorpion is on the loose. I urge all residents of the city: Close all your doors and windows. Stay indoors. Thank you. - Okay— - Just one more thing. Lasse and Maja, return the medals immediately. You don't deserve them! Thank you. - Okay, everyone listen. A deadly sco— Turn off the camera at once! You could be electrocuted if it gets wet. - It's right above us! - Wait! Hurry up! Pack it down. The serial burglar won in the end. - We're such failures. Why are you all dressed up? There's no party. - Yes, I heard that. But you see, I have other plans. - What plans? - This is for Irina. She turns 50 today. Have I told you that? - Only like a hundred times— - I've been thinking. You know? You're absolutely right. I don't care about the horoscope. I'm in charge of my own life. - What does the card say? - Congratulations, Siri. - Siri? - She was called that as a child. No idea why she changed her name. Irina must be Lillie's daughter. Yes, and she was born under Scorpio. She was at the library, she's on the committee, and she knew where the fireworks were. It all fits, Maja. - She tricked Kimmy into the hot dog stand, Then broke into Muhammad Karat's shop and took his scorpion. - What are we going to tell the Commissioner? - We just tell him everything. - He's gone! - To Irina! - And the deadly scorpion! Quick! Irina? Are you there? Scorpio zodiac sign— This way! Come on! No! Irina— We have to tell Lillie that the Scorpion has her daughter. - What? Wait. What? Her daughter? - Yes. Come on! - Now I don't understand anything! Where is Lillie? Who are you really? Siri's wish list. That Mum is coming home. Lots of sweets. Fireworks. A real— scorpion! Hello? Who are you, I said? - The enigma of the Scorpion. This is the answer. - Right in front of our eyes all the time. - How is that possible? She can't even walk. We've been so played. Hello my darling. - Mother? - But where is he? - Here. Happy 50th Birthday my beloved little Siri Ragnarsson. - My name isn't Ragnarsson any more. I changed to Dad's last name because I was ashamed of you. - Look what I've prepared for you! There's a ton of sweets! Just for you. And best of all, something you've always longed for— Say hello to this little fellow! - So it was you the whole time? - Yes! All for you, my love. - The game's over, Ragnarsson! - Oh! Lasse and Maja. How could you know that—? - We saw the wish list on the wall. This is the great work of art: a surprise party for your daughter. - By the way, you forgot your wheelchair. - That monstrosity! No— But it was a perfect alibi, wasn't it? It was the only way to get out of jail in time for Siri's birthday. And then you came into my life. You will never solve this. Which was very good. You helped me get the book I had borrowed. - It's gone! - What? The scorpion must have been here! What an amazing work of art it turned out to be! Didn't it? Didn't it? - Just like when I was a child. You only think about yourself. Do you know how many birthdays I had to celebrate alone? Dad was always away, and you were in prison. I had nothing to do, so I began to crochet and knit. Now I can't stop. I hate crocheting and knitting! - Yes but—that's why I did all the scorpion stuff— and this party instead. - No. It's just that you wanted to be the world's smartest burglar. In fact you ignore me. You always have! - That's actually not true. Lillie thinks about you a lot. She talks about you all the time. - Sorry. - What? - Sorry for all the parties I've missed. And everything I didn't do for you. Sorry. I'm so sorry for that. I think it's time for me to go now. - No, wait a minute! Stupid, stupid mother. Stupid Mum. - My little girl. My darling, darling little girl. Beautiful, beautiful you. Anyone dying for sweets? - Yes! - Yes! Here! - Free sweets! Free sweets in Valleby, 500 years! LasseMaja's Detective Agency— If you ever need help again, you can drop in. - At the prison, then, right? - Yes— It won't get any more luxurious now. - We'll come. - You will? - You won't get rid of us that easily. - That makes me so happy! There's one thing I haven't told you about. The grand finale. A magnificent climax. The final explosion! - Well? Is it free now, then? - Yes! - You mean—really free? - So! Free Valleby, 500 years! - Scorpio and Aquarius got each other in the end. Maybe the stars decide after all. - Maybe they do! We are gathered here today.
