YOU'RE DOIN' FINE. JUST TAKE IT SLOW AND EASY. OK. YOU WANT TO TRY AGAIN? THE SHIFTER GETS STUCK. I CAN'T TELL IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT GEAR. DON'T BLAME THE TRUCK. THE TRUCK WORKS FINE. YOU GOT TO KEEP TRYING. YOU GOTTA DO THINGS FOR YOURSELF. OK. [GRINDING] GIVE IT A LITTLE GAS-- A LITTLE GAS... GOOD. HEY... YOU GOT IT GOING GOOD. JUST DON'T HIT ANY SHEEP, NOW. WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY TO SPARE. PUT THE CLUTCH IN. GO AHEAD. HEY, POP, LOOK AT THIS. YEAH. A THOUSAND LEGGER. YEAH, HE'S A REAL MONSTER, ALL RIGHT. LOOK AT THE WAY ITS LEGS WIGGLE. [HELICOPTER] YOU SURE? MM... MAYBE I'LL TAKE IT BACK. [WHINING] [BARKING] [WHINING] CHRIS? SON, WAKE UP. [BARKING] [HONKING HORN] [HONKING] [HONKING] GOOD MORNIN', DAN. SOMETHING WRONG? WOULD YOU CALL DOC CARDWELL, TELL HIM TO GET OVER TO THE HOSPITAL SOON AS HE CAN? THE BOY'S GOT SOME KIND OF CONVULSIONS. HE FEELS LIKE HE'S BURNING UP. I--I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. HE WAS FINE YESTERDAY. WE CAMPED OUT LAST NIGHT NEAR THE CREEK, AND THIS MORNING HE'S SICK. WOULD YOU CALL SPIKE BOYNTON, TOO, AND TELL HIM THERE'S A COUPLE OF MY SHEEP I WANT HIM TO GO OVER THERE AND LOOK AT. THEY'RE STRETCHED OUT, THEIR LEGS STRAIGHT OUT, AND SOME OF 'EM ARE TWITCHIN', AND THERE'S BLOOD RUNNING OUT OF THEIR NOSTRILS. TELL HIM IT'S ABOUT HALF WAY YOU WANT SARAH TO COME WITH YOU? NO. WE'LL BE FINE. OH--CAN EMILY STAY WITH YOU? OH, SURE. EMILY, STAY HERE. [WOOF] [HORN HONKING] [HONKING] [HONKING] Doctor: ALL RIGHT, JOYCE, GET HIM READY. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN LIKE THIS? WELL, I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE-- EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR. IS THIS THE PATIENT? NO. THIS IS THE FATHER. THIS IS MR. LOGAN. DR. HOLLIFORD. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS, DOCTOR? THERE'S FEVER, NASAL HEMORRHAGE, HYPERTONIA OF THE BICEPS AND UPPER LEG AND CONVULSIONS. HAS HE BEEN VOMITING? NO, SIR. I DON'T THINK SO. HAS THERE BEEN ANY INVOLUNTARY URINATION? UM... DID HE WET HIMSELF? YES. I THINK SO. WAS HE OUTSIDE ANYTIME LAST NIGHT? WE WAS OUT THE WHOLE NIGHT. WE CAMPED OUT. IS THAT HIM? I'M GONNA NEED A GLUCOSE I.V., PLEASE. EXCUSE ME. MR. LOGAN? I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ADMIT YOUR SON INTO THE HOSPITAL. RELAX. UH, WHAT IS IT? IS HE ALL RIGHT? IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY. DOES YOUR SON HAVE A HISTORY OF, UH, ASTHMA? NO, SIR. HE EVER HAVE RHEUMATIC FEVER? NO. ANY BLOOD DISORDER? WELL, HE'S NEVER BEEN SICK AT ALL EXCEPT WHEN HE HAD HIS TONSILS OUT. WHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICE THE SYMPTOMS? WELL, HE WAS SICK LIKE THAT THIS MORNING WHEN I GOT UP, JUST LIKE HE IS NOW. WHAT TIME WAS THAT? AROUND 6:00. WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND HIM, DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU AT ALL? NO, SIR. DID HE RETAIN VISUAL MOTOR CONTROL? I'M NOT SURE I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I'M SORRY. DID HE--HIS EYES, DID THEY LOOK WANDERING, DID THEY LOOK GLAZED, FAR AWAY? I GUESS THEY DID-- EXCUSE ME, DR. HOLLIFORD. DO YOU WANT THIS I.V. RIGHT AWAY? YES, SIR. AND WOULD YOU PUT HIM IN ISOLATION, PLEASE? WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT HE WAS CAMPING LAST NIGHT. WERE YOU WITH HIM? WELL, I WAS IN THE TENT. THE BOY WANTED TO SLEEP OUTSIDE. WHERE WERE YOU CAMPED? MY RANCH, ABOUT 20 MILES NORTH OF HERE, BY THE BASIN. I SEE. THAT'S NEAR MEDICINE CREEK, ISN'T IT? YEAH, ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THERE. OK. WOULD YOU STEP OVER HERE FOR A SECOND, PLEASE? TAKE YOUR JACKET OFF AND ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVE. I WANT TO TAKE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE. I FEEL ALL RIGHT. OH, IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. JUST A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. HI, DAN. GOT HERE SOON AS I COULD. ROY, HOW ARE YA? I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET. I'M ROY CARDWELL, MR. LOGAN'S PHYSICIAN. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR. I'M DR. HOLLIFORD. YOU LOOKED AT CHRIS? THAT'S MR. LOGAN'S SON? THAT'S RIGHT. YES, I DID. UH, WE JUST PUT HIM IN ISOLATION. UH, DR. THOMPSON'S WITH HIM NOW. JOYCE... WOULD YOU FINISH TAKING MR. LOGAN'S BLOOD PRESSURE, PLEASE? TAKE TWO BLOOD SAMPLES. SEND ONE TO PATHOLOGY AND HOLD THE OTHER ONE FOR ME. ARE YOU FROM RAWLINS, MR. LOGAN? NO, MA'AM. LAMONT. WELL, NOW, DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR SON. HE'LL BE JUST FINE. DR. THOMPSON WILL TAKE REAL GOOD CARE OF HIM. NOW, THIS WON'T HURT AT ALL. DAN, UH... DR. HOLLIFORD'S JUST BEEN TELLING ME ABOUT WHAT HE FOUND WHEN HE EXAMINED CHRIS. NOW...NOW, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, BUT, UH, DR. HOLLIFORD'S A SPECIALIST. I'M GOING TO LET HIM SUPERVISE CHRIS' CARE. HE KNOWS A LOT MORE ABOUT IT THAN I DO. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAY A MAN ISN'T A GOOD DOCTOR UNLESS HE KNOWS WHEN TO CALL IN HELP. WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT? OH, SURE. HE'LL BE FINE. IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF FINDING OUT WHAT IT IS AND TAKING THE RIGHT STEPS. AND, UM... WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RUN A FEW TESTS ON YOU, TOO. NOW, DR. HOLLIFORD WANTS YOU TO CHECK INTO THE HOSPITAL JUST FOR A FEW DAYS, JUST IN CASE YOU GOT SOME OF THE SAME THING. YOU REALLY THINK I SHOULD? YEAH, I THINK SO. GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO BE NEAR CHRIS, AND THIS WAY, WE'D TAKE A LOOK AT YOU. WELL, ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT IF YOU THINK IT'S THE BEST THING. GOOD. NOW, LET'S GO ON DOWN AND GET YOU CHECKED IN. COLONEL FRANKLIN, I'M MAJOR REINTZ. COLONEL NICKERSON SENT ME TO SHOW YOU YOUR QUARTERS, SIR. MAJOR. UH, COLONEL NICKERSON HAS A BRIEFING PLAN FOR YOU, SIR, AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY. REINTZ, KAGLE. HOW ARE YOU? THAT'LL BE ALL, SERGEANT. YES, SIR. DR. SPENCER, GOOD TO SEE YOU. UH, GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET COLONEL WILLIAM FRANKLIN FROM WASHINGTON, MAJOR KAGLE IS MEDICAL OFFICER, DR. WALTER STIENROD FROM CHIVINGTON LABORATORIES, DR. TOM JANEWAY, ALSO FROM CHIVINGTON, MAJOR REINTZ, MY ASSISTANT, AND DR. SPENCER FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE. DR. SPENCER HAS WORKED WITH US BEFORE, SO HE HAS ALL THE NECESSARY CLEARANCE, AND I'VE ASKED HIM TO JOIN US TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE FROM HERE ON. NOW, GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT THIS MEETING IS SUBJECT TO STRICT SECURITY. IT SHOULDN'T BE DISCUSSED WITH ANYONE NOT HERE IN THIS ROOM. AS YOU ALL KNOW, THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT ON THE POST WHICH MAY WELL LEAD TO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. MAJOR REINTZ HAS BEEN MONITORING THE SITUATION, SO I'LL LET HIM GIVE YOU THE DETAILS. JACK? GENTLEMEN, YESTERDAY AT 17:30 HOURS-- EXCUSE ME-- OUR CHEMICAL EVALUATION UNIT WAS CONDUCTING A TEST ON MX-3. IT'S A NEW CHEMICAL AGENT WE RECEIVED FROM CHIVINGTON FOR PRELIMINARY TESTING. THE TEST INVOLVED AEROSOL DISTRIBUTION FROM AN AIRBORNE SPRAYER. MORNIN', SPIKE. MORNIN'. COME ON IN. SARAH'S GOT SOME COFFEE. I CAN'T DO IT. THANKS JUST THE SAME. I GOT SOME CALLS TO MAKE OVER IN BEAR OIL. I JUST STOPPED BY TO TELL YA I'VE BEEN OVER AT DAN LOGAN'S PLACE, AND THINGS LOOK PRETTY BAD OVER THERE. I'D SAY HE'S GOT MORE THAN 200 SHEEP DEAD... AND A LOT MORE THAN THAT THAT ARE SICK, SO YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR STOCK AS FAR AWAY FROM THERE AS YOU CAN. SURE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS, BLUE TONGUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. LOOKS MIGHTY PECULIAR. I'M GONNA STOP BACK LATER AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. AS SOON AS DAN GETS BACK, HAVE HIM GIVE ME A CALL. I SURE WILL. AND YOU KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR OWN STOCK. YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT LOOKS FUNNY, YOU GIVE ME A CALL RIGHT AWAY. I WILL, AND THANKS FOR COMING BY. NOT AT ALL. AND AT THAT POINT, AS A MATTER OF STANDARD PROCEDURE, THE PLANE WAS CALLED BACK AND INSPECTED. THE GROUND CREW DISCOVERED THAT THE VALVE HAD LOCKED IN THE OPEN POSITION. WE CALCULATE THAT AT THAT POINT WHERE THE VALVE FAILED TO CLOSE, THE TANK WAS ABOUT 1/3 FULL. NOW, WITH THE SPRAY SETTING WE WERE USING, THE, UH... THE PLANE WOULD HAVE TRAVELED ABOUT 5 MILES BEFORE THE TANK WOULD HAVE EMPTIED, BRINGING IT TO ABOUT, UH... HERE. MAJOR... YES, SIR. NOW, ISN'T THE PLANE EQUIPPED WITH AN INDICATOR THAT WOULD TELL THE PILOT WHETHER THE VALVE HAD CLOSED? IT SEEMS LIKE AN ELEMENTARY PRECAUTION. WELL, SIR, ACTUALLY, UH, MOST OF OUR PLANES DO HAVE THAT FEATURE, BUT WE'RE STILL FLYING SOME THAT DON'T. AND THIS ONE DIDN'T. THAT'S CORRECT, SIR. SO RETURNING TO WHAT I WAS SAYING, WE'RE, UH, ONLY INTERESTED IN THE FLIGHT PATH FROM THE END OF THIS TEST AREA OUT TO, UH, OUT TO HERE, BECAUSE THE TANK WOULD HAVE BEEN EMPTY PAST THIS POINT. NOW, AT THE TIME OF THE TEST, THE PREVAILING WINDS WERE FROM THE SOUTHEAST BLOWING THE AGENT IN THIS DIRECTION, SO THE FIRST THING WE DID, WE HAD THE STATE POLICE CLOSE OFF A 25-MILE SECTION OF THIS ROUTE 287 FROM HERE TO HERE, THEN WE SENT OUT HELICOPTERS AND GROUND OBSERVERS TO MEASURE THE SPREAD OF THE GAS. WE FOUND BY DOING THIS THAT THE HEAVIEST CONCENTRATION OUTSIDE OF THE FORT ITSELF IS JUST ACROSS THIS ROUTE 287, RIGHT HERE... NEAR MEDICINE CREEK. NOW, FORTUNATELY, THE WINDS WERE VERY LIGHT, AND BY 0600 HOURS THIS MORNING, ALL OF OUR READINGS WERE NEAR ZERO. OH, YES--OF COURSE WE ORDERED ALL PERSONNEL CLEARED FROM THE CONTAMINATED AREAS OF THE FORT ITSELF, SO WE HAD NO IMMEDIATE HEALTH HAZARD THERE. NOW, WE DO HAVE TWO SUSPECTED CASES OF EXPOSURE, BUT THE MAXIMUM READING OVER THAT AREA WAS 20 MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER. THIS IS ONLY ABOUT HALF THE LETHAL CONCENTRATION. JUST A MINUTE, MAJOR. IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THOSE PEOPLE DOWN THERE ARE SAFE, YOU'RE BEING VERY MISLEADING. EVEN A VERY SMALL CONCENTRATION OF MX-3 WILL KILL YOU IF YOU BREATHE IT LONG ENOUGH. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A SAFE CONCENTRATION. WELL, I'M VERY SORRY IF I WAS BEING A LITTLE BIT VAGUE. WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT WE MEASURED 20 MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER. WE'VE ESTABLISHED 35 AS THE EFFECTIVE MILITARY CONCENTRATION. YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A MILITARY SITUATION HERE. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS OF EXPOSURE TO THAT CONCENTRATION WOULD KILL OVER 50% OF THE EXPOSED POPULATION. I THINK WE HAVE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION HERE, AND I DON'T SEE ANY POINT IN TRYING TO PAPER OVER IT. NOW, TOM, NOBODY'S PROPOSING THAT WE DON'T HAVE A DANGEROUS SITUATION. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE. [BANJO PLAYS ON RADIO] I'M SORRY, SIR. YOU'LL HAVE TO STOP RIGHT HERE. WHAT'S GOING ON? THIS RANCH HAS BEEN QUARANTINED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE. WHY? I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING. NOW, AS TO POINT 3... THERE ARE ONLY 4 MAJOR HOSPITALS-- OR ANY KIND OF HOSPITALS-- WITHIN 100 MILES OF THE AFFECTED AREA. WE'VE ALREADY SENT OUT OUR OWN MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO COVER THESE. AS MAJOR REINTZ HAS MENTIONED, MAJOR HOLLIFORD OF CARBON COUNTY HAS ALREADY REPORTED TWO CASES OF POSSIBLE EXPOSURE. NOW, LUCKILY FOR US, MAJOR HOLLIFORD HAS DONE SOME WORK FOR CARBON COUNTY IN THE PAST AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE CASES THERE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, UH, DR. JANEWAY HAS JUST BEEN IN TOUCH WITH HIM. TOM, WHY DON'T YOU FILL US IN ON THAT, HUH? RIGHT. FROM WHAT MAJOR HOLLIFORD TOLD ME, WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT TWO CASES OF EXPOSURE. IT'S A RANCHER NAMED DANIEL LOGAN AND HIS 12-YEAR-OLD SON. IT SEEMS THEY WERE CAMPED OUT ALL NIGHT NEAR MEDICINE CREEK, SO WE CAN BE SURE THEY WERE HEAVILY EXPOSED. THE BOY'S SYMPTOMS ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS THE ONES WE'VE OBSERVED IN OUR LABORATORY ANIMALS-- CONVULSIONS, BLEEDING, AND SO ON. THE FATHER'S SYMPTOMS ARE VERY MILD SO FAR, BUT SINCE THE ACTION OF THE AGENT IS PROGRESSIVE, WE CAN BE SURE THAT AS TIME PASSES, THEY'LL BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO HUMANS, SOME OF THE ANIMALS ON THE LOGAN RANCH SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, AND THE DESCRIPTION WE HAVE FROM LOGAN CORRESPONDS EXACTLY WITH OUR LABORATORY RESULTS. OF COURSE... THIS AGENT'S A NEW TYPE. WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY HUMAN SUBJECTS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO STUDY BOTH THESE CASES CAREFULLY SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THE AGENT OPERATES. I REALIZE THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT, BUT WE'D BE FOOLISH TO OVERLOOK THE OPPORTUNITY IT GIVES US TO OBSERVE AN AGENT OF THIS TYPE ACTING ON HUMAN SUBJECTS. UH, DR. JANEWAY... FROM YOUR CONVERSATION WITH MAJOR HOLLIFORD, CAN YOU ESTIMATE THE CHANCES THAT EITHER OF THESE PEOPLE WILL SURVIVE? I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT I MADE THAT CLEAR. FROM THE INFORMATION WE HAVE, I SEE NO REASON TO EXPECT EITHER OF THEM TO SURVIVE. [PANTING] HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I'M ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE HELL THEY WANT TO KEEP ME HERE ANYWAY. AH, TAKE IT EASY. IT'S JUST FOR A DAY. THEY HAVE TO RUN SOME TESTS, AND THEY CAN'T VERY WELL DO THAT IF YOU'RE NOT HERE. I'D SOONER BE HOME. THEY GOT SOME TESTS TO DO, I CAN COME BACK TOMORROW. WELL, THE TESTS AREN'T THAT SIMPLE. I REALLY THINK YOU OUGHT TO STAY HERE FOR A WHILE. I GOT TO GET BACK TO THE RANCH AND LOOK AT MY STOCK. I TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM SHEEP. WELL, LOOK, UM... WHY DON'T I CALL BILL PARKER? HE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS FOR YOU. ANYTHING REALLY SERIOUS, SPIKE WOULD LET YOU KNOW. WELL... I SUPPOSE SO. IF YOU WANT TO. I'LL JUST BE GLAD TO GET OUT OF HERE... WHEN THEY'RE THROUGH. YOU KNOW, ROY... I HAVEN'T BEEN IN A HOSPITAL SINCE JOANNE DIED. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT CHRIS. MADE ME PRETTY NERVOUS TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT THIS MORNING. UH, THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, A BOY THAT AGE, YOU JUST CAN'T KEEP 'EM IN BED VERY LONG. I AM WORRIED. HE'S NEVER BEEN SICK BEFORE AT ALL. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY. DR. HOLLIFORD THINKS IT MIGHT BE A REACTION TO AN INSECTICIDE. HE'S GONNA RUN SOME ALLERGY TESTS, AND, UM, HE'LL PROBABLY KNOW IN THE MORNING. I HOPE SO. DAN... DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. THESE YOUNG DOCTORS TODAY, THEY... THEY KNOW MORE THAN I EVER WILL. HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. YOU BETTER GET DR. THOMPSON RIGHT AWAY. [ON P.A. SYSTEM] DR. THOMPSON TO ISOLATION. DR. THOMPSON TO ISOLATION. [MOANING] ALL RIGHT, BARBARA, I'LL TAKE OVER. [MOANING] GIVE ME ADRENALINE, 1/2 CC. GET ME THE BOARD. SEE IF YOU CAN GET A PULSE. I DON'T GET A PULSE. GIVE ME ANOTHER 1/2 CC. YOU GET ANYTHING? NO. NOTHING AT ALL. STILL NO PULSE. STILL NO PULSE. WELL, THAT'S IT. I'LL CALL DR. HOLLIFORD. SEE THAT HE'S PUT IN THE FREEZER RIGHT AWAY. TV: OLD DAVE WILCOX, COUNTY AGENT OVER IN PLATT COUNTY-- I KNOW HE'S GOT A LOT OF PRACTICAL NEW IDEAS FOR YOU, AND OF COURSE WE'LL HAVE OUR WEATHER AND CROP REPORTS SAME AS USUAL, BUT FIRST, NATURALLY, HERE'S TOM ARNOLD WITH THE MORNING NEWS. THANKS, SHELDON. THE BIG NEWS THIS MORNING COMES FROM CARBON COUNTY. WE HAVE A REPORT THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED SHEEP DIED YESTERDAY ABOUT 30 MILES NORTH OF RAWLINS NEAR FORT HOWARD, RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF CARBON COUNTY. THE PUBLIC SERVICE-- THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE TOLD ME THEY'RE INVESTIGATING IT THOROUGHLY. I READ THE MORNING EDITION OF THE CASPER POST SENTINEL, AND THEY HAVE A QUOTE FROM P.H.S. OFFICIALS THAT THE DEATHS MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF INSECTICIDE POISONING. OF COURSE, WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE HERE IN WYOMING, BUT I TALKED WITH A LOCAL VETERINARIAN LAST NIGHT WHO SAW THE SHEEP HIMSELF, AND HE TOLD ME HE THINKS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL CHEMICAL MIGHT BE INVOLVED, A CHEMICAL LIKE THE ONE THE ARMY USES IN TESTS IN COMBAT, SOMETHING THEY CALL NERVE GAS. IF THIS IS TRUE, IT'S A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN TO EVERYONE IN OUR VIEWING AREA. THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS FOR A LONG TIME THAT THESE KINDS OF TESTS ARE BEING CONDUCTED AT FORT HOWARD. MOST OF YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AT THE DUGWAY PROVING GROUNDS... FRED, SORRY TO WAKE YOU. I WAS JUST WATCHING THE RANCH NEWS. THEY'VE GOT A LONG ITEM ON IT ABOUT THIS MEDICINE CREEK BUSINESS. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A VETERINARIAN WHO SAW THE SHEEP? WELL, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. THIS VET CLAIMS TO HAVE EXAMINED THE SHEEP, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT NERVE GAS. THAT'S RIGHT. WE BETTER TRY TO GET HOLD OF HIM RIGHT AWAY. LET'S GET TOGETHER ON THIS THING THIS AFTERNOON. THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BLOW UP. WE WANT TO GET THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE OUT OF IT PRONTO. MORNING. HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING? GOOD MORNING, DOCTOR. DO YOU HAVE CHRIS LOGAN'S FILE? I'M SORRY, DOCTOR. CHRIS LOGAN DIED DURING THE NIGHT. DR. HOLLIFORD WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT. WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN THE LUNCH ROOM. WHAT I HAVE TO KEEP ON MIND HERE IS THE ARMY'S POSITION IN THIS MATTER. EXCUSE ME, DR. HOLLIFORD. THE, UH... I JUST HEARD ABOUT CHRIS LOGAN. OH, YES. OH, EXCUSE ME. DR. CARDWELL, THIS IS DR. SPENCER FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AT CASPER. DR. CARDWELL IS MR. LOGAN'S PHYSICIAN. I'M VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT? I DIDN'T THINK CHRIS LOGAN WAS IN ANY DANGER. FACT IS, I DIDN'T-- WHY DON'T YOU LET ME ANSWER THAT. WILL YOU SIT DOWN PLEASE, DOCTOR? THIS, UH--THIS IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE WHOLE MATTER IS RATHER DELICATE. WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT KILLED CHRIS LOGAN. WE THINK THAT IT WAS A TOXIC CHEMICAL THAT WE FOUND TRACES OF IN THE MEDICINE CREEK AREA. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT YET. WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO FIND OUT AND KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL. NATURALLY, WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED. AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, THE LOGANS WERE THE ONLY ONES AFFECTED BY IT. DR. HOLLIFORD HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN CHEMICAL TOXICATION, AND HE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF HELP TO US. OF COURSE, HE DID ALL HE COULD FOR CHRIS. RIGHT NOW, THE THING WE'RE MOST AFRAID OF IS PANIC IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO ASK YOU NOT TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT CHRIS LOGAN'S DEATH. UNTIL WE GET THIS SITUATION IN HAND, WE DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY UNNECESSARY ALARM. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE AREA? THERE'S NO DANGER TO THEM. WE'VE TESTED THEM. WE'VE TESTED THEIR RANCHES. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW IS FIND OUT WHAT THIS IS, FIND OUT WHERE IT CAME FROM, AND SEE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS YESTERDAY? WELL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, WE DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW BADLY CHRIS LOGAN WAS. SINCE WE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, WE SAW NO POINT IN WORRYING YOU ABOUT IT. WE WANT TO KEEP THIS WHOLE THING AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT TELL ANYONE. WELL, I GUESS YOU KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING THAN I DO. YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW EASILY RUMORS GET STARTED AND WHAT UNNECESSARY WORRY THEY CAUSE. BELIEVE ME, IT'S THE BEST WAY. WELL, I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO TELL ANYBODY, I WON'T. I'D APPRECIATE IT. I REALLY WOULD. OH, ONE OTHER THING, DOCTOR, THAT WE HAVE TO ASK YOU. DR. HOLLIFORD IS RUNNING A SERIES OF TESTS TO SEE HOW BADLY THE BOY'S FATHER WAS AFFECTED. WE'RE AFRAID THAT IF HE HEARS ABOUT HIS SON'S DEATH, HIS REACTION MAY INTERFERE WITH THE TESTS, SO WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU NOT TO TELL HIM ABOUT IT, EITHER. WILL IT REALLY MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE? ABSOLUTELY, DOCTOR. IT'S VITAL FOR THE TESTS. I DON'T SEE HOW IT WOULD HURT IF HE DOESN'T HEAR ABOUT THIS FOR A DAY OR TWO. YEAH...I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT ROOM MR. LOGAN IS IN? I CAME OVER TO VISIT HIM. I'M AWFULLY SORRY, MA'AM. MR. LOGAN ISN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY VISITORS. OH, THAT'S TOO BAD. I WONDER IF YOU COULD DO ME A FAVOR. I BROUGHT SOME OF HIS THINGS OVER FOR HIM. CAN I LEAVE 'EM HERE WITH YOU? YES, MA'AM. I'LL SEE THAT HE GETS THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT FOR ME TO SEE CHRIS LOGAN? THAT'S DAN'S SON. I'M SORRY, MA'AM. HE'S NOT ALLOWED ANY VISITORS, EITHER. HOW IS HE? IS HE GETTING BETTER? YES, MA'AM. HIS CONDITION IS SATISFACTORY. THAT'S GOOD. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. Man: WE'RE ROLLING. [SLATE SNAPS] ALL RIGHT, MAJOR. RECENTLY, QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN CONNECT-- COULD WE START AGAIN PLEASE, MAJOR? RECENTLY, QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPARENT INSECTICIDE POISONING OF SEVERAL HUNDRED SHEEP ON RANCHES NEAR FORT HOWARD. THE ARMY WISHES TO CLARIFY ITS POSITION ON THIS MATTER. THE ARMY HAS CONDUCTED NO TESTS OF ANY TOXIC MATERIAL IN THE VICINITY OF THE AFFECTED RANCHES IN THE MEDICINE CREEK AREA. HOWEVER, COLONEL ALAN A. NICKERSON, COMMANDING OFFICER OF FORT HOWARD, HAS PLACED THE FORT'S FACILITIES AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE TO AID IN ITS INVESTIGATION. THE ARMY INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS FULL COOPERATION WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE OUT OF CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE IN THE AREA. WAS THAT OK? LOOKED GOOD TO ME. LOOKS GOOD TO ME. ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN DISCONNECT HIM NOW. YOU SENT FOR ME, DOCTOR? YES, MA'AM. WE'RE JUST ABOUT THROUGH HERE, SO WHY DON'T YOU GET MR. LOGAN'S MEDICATION READY? ALL RIGHT. HOW'S MY BOY? HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM. I SAID I'D LIKE TO GO SEE HIM. WELL, I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD RIGHT NOW. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT HE NOT BE DISTURBED. I JUST WANT TO LOOK IN ON HIM. WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT I REALLY CAN'T ALLOW IT RIGHT NOW. MAYBE TOMORROW. WHAT'S THE MATTER? NOTHING. I'M JUST THINKING OF HIM, SIR. IS SOMETHING WRONG? NO. IT'S JUST THAT WE HAD TO MOVE HIM TO ANOTHER PART OF THE HOSPITAL SO HE WOULDN'T BE DISTURBED. I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT HIM. ALL RIGHT, MR. LOGAN. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. WHAT ABOUT THE TERMINAL PATIENT IN 103? I WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE IN MR. LOGAN'S MEDICATION. YOU CAN TAKE HIM OFF THE VALIUM FOR NOW, BUT I WANT HIM TO GET 3 GRAINS OF PHENOBARBITAL SODIUM RIGHT AWAY, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR. THANK YOU. Doctor: ALL READY. Doctor #2: ALL RIGHT THEN. LET'S GET STARTED. IS THE MICROPHONE ON? YES, SIR. THE BODY IS THAT OF A WELL-DEVELOPED MALE YOUTH APPEARING TO BE APPROXIMATELY 12 YEARS OF AGE. LENGTH IS... 61 1/2 INCHES. NUTRITIONAL STATUS IS WELL-MAINTAINED. THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL EVIDENCE OF INJURY. PUPILS ARE 3 MILLIMETERS AND REGULAR. THORAX AND ABDOMEN SYMMETRICAL. THERE IS...NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT THE EXTREMITIES. THE BODY IS OPENED WITH A STANDARD Y-SHAPED INCISION. [CALL BELL DINGS] YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT MR. LOGAN WANTS. ALL RIGHT. IS SOMETHING THE MATTER? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? OH, THAT'S JUST AN INTRAVENOUS. IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME. WHERE'S MY SON? NOW, YOU JUST REST. DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING. I WANNA SEE CHRIS. WHERE'S DR. HOLLIFORD? MR. LOGAN, EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT. YOU JUST NEED SOME SLEEP. I'LL LOOK IN ON YOU LATER. [WHIMPERING] GOOD MORNING, DR. CARDWELL. MORNING. WHO ORDERED THE INTRAVENOUS ON MR. LOGAN? IT MUST'VE BEEN DR. HOLLIFORD. IT WAS BEFORE I CAME ON. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GETTING? JUST GLUCOSE AND A SEDATIVE EVERY THIRD BOTTLE. UM...YOU HAVE MR. LOGAN'S CHART? I'LL GET IT FOR YOU. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HERE. I'M PRETTY SURE DR. HOLLIFORD HAD IT. HE'S BEEN WORKING IN 113. WHY DON'T YOU LOOK IN THERE? ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. DR. HOLLIFORD, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE? IS IT IMPORTANT? I'M BUSY NOW. YES, IT IS. I'LL GET A CUP OF COFFEE. WHAT IS IT, DOCTOR? I JUST SAW YOUR FILE ON DAN LOGAN. OH, REALLY? I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN A FEW THINGS. WELL, THAT DEPENDS. WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW? WELL, I SAW YOUR ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS, AND I TRIED TO COMPARE THEM TO THE ONES YOU'D MARKED IN BRODIE AND CRAMER. NOW, MAYBE IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS TO MAKE A DIAGNOSIS, BUT IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE DAN HAS WHAT THEY CALL &quot;BRIGGS-MIERBURG SYNDROME.&quot; YES. THAT'S MORE OR LESS CORRECT. WELL, IF I UNDERSTOOD THE BOOK RIGHT, THAT SYNDROME'S NEARLY ALWAYS FATAL. THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, YOU HAVE A PROGNOSIS?! I MIGHT AS WELL BE PERFECTLY FRANK WITH YOU, DOCTOR. I DON'T EXPECT HIM TO LIVE MORE THAN ANOTHER WEEK. YOU'RE SURE OF THAT? YES, I AM. DID DR. SPENCER KNOW ABOUT THIS? YES, HE DOES. THEN WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME? DAN LOGAN IS MY PATIENT. WHY DO YOU HAVE HIM ON SEDATION? I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP HIM REST. HE SURELY DOESN'T NEED CONSTANT SEDATION. I THINK HE SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE I.V. DOES HE KNOW ABOUT HIS CONDITION? NO, AND FRANKLY, I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM. WHY NOT? HE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. THERE'S JUST NO POINT IN GETTING HIM UPSET. I DON'T AGREE. I'VE KNOWN DAN LOGAN FOR 40 YEARS, AND I KNOW HE'D WANT ME TO TELL HIM. I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD, DOCTOR. I HAVE TO INSIST. I'M SORRY, BUT I'M GONNA TELL HIM. I DON'T THINK YOU HANDLED THIS THING VERY WELL AT ALL. I'M GONNA SEE DAN, THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE A LONG TALK WITH DR. SPENCER. JUST ONE MOMENT, AND I'LL CHECK FOR YOU. OH, DR. CARDWELL, THERE'S A CALL HERE FOR YOU. TAKE A MESSAGE. COULD I TAKE A MESSAGE, PLEASE? JUST A MOMENT. WHERE'S MR. LOGAN? HE'S HAVING A FEW MORE TESTS. I WANT TO SEE HIM. THERE'S NO REASON TO BE UPSET, DR. CARDWELL. BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW MR. SIMPSON. HE'S A COLLEAGUE OF DR. HOLLIFORD'S. DOCTOR. WHY, UH-- WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE, DOCTOR? NO, THANK YOU. WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION HERE. WOMEN--MY PULSE RATE GOES UP. NOW, YOU PEOPLE ARE NURSES. REALLY, MY PULSE GOES UP. ARE YOU WATCHING HIM OR NOT? NO PROBLEM, DOC. NOT A PEEP OUT OF HIM. YOU'D BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. HE'S BEEN TAKEN OFF SEDATION. HAS HE HAD HIS DINNER? YES, SIR, ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. GOOD. WELL, I BETTER GO AND TALK TO HIM. YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU? NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE NECESSARY. YOU JUST WAIT OUTSIDE. HELLO, MR. LOGAN. I'M DR. SPENCER. WHERE'S DR. CARDWELL? HE WON'T BE SEEING YOU ANYMORE. HE'S ASKED ME TO TAKE OVER YOUR CASE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HE'S BEEN MY DOCTOR ALL MY LIFE. WELL, WE RAN INTO SOME PROBLEMS THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BEST BE LEFT TO DR. HOLLIFORD AND MYSELF. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS? THERE'S NO NEED TO BE ALARMED. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR A DOCTOR TO TAKE HIMSELF OFF A CASE IF HE FEELS IT'S IN THE PATIENT'S INTEREST. I WANNA TALK TO ROY CARDWELL. YES, OF COURSE. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW DR. HOLLIFORD AND I WOULD BE LOOKING AFTER YOU FROM NOW ON JUST SO YOU WOULDN'T BE ALARMED. YOU LOOKING AFTER MY BOY, TOO? YES...YES, I AM. I WANT TO SEE HIM. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM. WELL, WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE DIFFICULTY WITH HIS DIAGNOSIS. WE DON'T THINK IT'S SERIOUS, BUT IT IS SOMETHING A LITTLE UNUSUAL. IT'LL TAKE US A WEEK OR TWO TO FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT IT IS. THESE THINGS HAPPEN SOMETIMES. WHY CAN'T I SEE HIM? WE DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE DISTURBED RIGHT NOW. BELIEVE ME, WHEN IT'S ALL RIGHT, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM. ALL I WANT TO DO IS LOOK AT HIM. THERE'S--THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT TONIGHT. WE'LL, UM--WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE MORNING. OH...THAT'S TERRIFIC. HERE. THAT'S MY FAVORITE. WHAT ARE YOU-- IT'S HAM. HOSPITAL HAM. YES. DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE? SURE. ALL RIGHT. [TABLE SLIDES OUT] [WEEPING] GODDAMN IT... GODDAMN IT! YOU WANT ANYTHING? SOME BLACK COFFEE. PIECE OF THIS CAKE. SIMPSON... HAVE YOU SEEN-- HAVE YOU SEEN MR. LOGAN? NO. HE'S IN HIS ROOM, ISN'T HE? [ENGINE STARTS] UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I FELT THE BEST THING WAS TO DECIDE WHERE HE'S MOST LIKELY TO GO AND HAVE OUR MEN THERE WAITING FOR HIM WHEN HE SHOWS UP. I SENT A DETAIL TO HIS RANCH, AND I'VE GOT MEN AT THE AIRPORT AND THE BUS DEPOT. I'VE ALSO GOT 3 MEN LOOKING FOR HIM DOWNTOWN AND ANOTHER ONE WAITING AT HIS BANK, AND I'VE ASKED THE POLICE TO CALL ME IF THEY PICK HIM UP. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT PUTTING UP ROADBLOCKS? YES, SIR. WE TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT WE RULED IT OUT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE'D CAUSE TOO MUCH COMMENT. BESIDES, HE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR, AND IF HE GOT ONE, HE'D PROBABLY DRIVE TO HIS RANCH, AND WE ALREADY HAVE MEN STATIONED THERE. I SEE. EXCUSE ME, BUT WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO ABOUT DR. CARDWELL? THAT'S A GOOD POINT. THERE MUST BE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL WHO COULD CAUSE TROUBLE ABOUT HIM. I WAS JUST COMING TO THAT. WHAT ABOUT THE NURSES? WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN TOLD? WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT, DR. HOLLIFORD. YOU DIDN'T THINK WE NEEDED MORE THAN ONE MAN TO WATCH LOGAN. IF HE'D DONE HIS JOB, THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY TROUBLE-- IF LOGAN HAD BEEN SLEEPING, THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY PROBLEM EITHER. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. THAT'S ENOUGH. KNOCK IT OFF. I'LL TAKE IT. THAT'S A REAL HANDY KIND OF A GUN. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T SELL MORE OF THEM. GUESS YOU'LL NEED SOME SHELLS. YEAH. [DOORBELL RINGS] [RING-RING] [REPEATED RINGING] WHO IS IT? WHO IS IT? DAN LOGAN.

WELL, I--I WISH I KNEW THAT MYSELF. MY BOY'S DEAD. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT KILLED HIM. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, MR. LOGAN. WE STILL DON'T KNOW. DON'T LIE TO ME. YOU TOLD ME CHRIS WAS ALL RIGHT. WELL, I--I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU JUST THEN. I... IN THE MORNING I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU-- DON'T GIVE ME THAT SHIT. HE'D BEEN DEAD FOR 2 DAYS! NOW, SOMETHING GOT TO ME AND MY SHEEP, AND IT KILLED MY BOY. NOW THE ARMY'S ALL OVER MY RANCH. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. YOU'VE BEEN IN ON THIS FROM THE BEGINNING-- YOU AND THE ARMY. THERE MUST BE SOME MISUNDERSTANDING. I'M NOT WITH THE ARMY. I'M WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. MR. LOGAN, YOU--YOU REALLY SHOULD BE IN THE HOSPITAL. THE DISEASE THAT KILLED YOUR BOY IS KILLING YOU. IF YOU DON'T GET BACK TO THE HOSPITAL, YOU'LL BE DEAD IN 2 WEEKS. I KNOW HOW SICK I AM. I JUST TALKED TO ROY CARDWELL. I KNOW I'M GONNA DIE IN A FEW DAYS, AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. I CAN'T TELL YOU. I DON'T KNOW. AND EVEN IF I DID KNOW, I--I COULDN'T TELL YOU. ALL THIS IS SECRET INFORMATION. LOOK, MR. LOGAN, WHAT POSSIBLE GOOD WOULD IT DO FOR ME TO TELL YOU THESE THINGS? DAMN YOU, TELL ME. [RRRROWWRRR] ALL RIGHT. IT WAS A CHEMICAL... CALLED MX-3.

THE FBI SAID THAT LOGAN'S FINGERPRINTS WERE FOUND ON DEMOLITION EQUIPMENT USED IN THE EXPLOSIONS. A WIDESPREAD MANHUNT FOR LOGAN IS UNDERWAY THROUGHOUT THE MOUNTAIN STATES AREA.

WALTER STEENROD, DIRECTOR OF THE LABORATORIES, HAS ALSO REFUSED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT ABOUT THE INCIDENT. A WYOMING PHYSICIAN, DR. ROY CARDWELL, HAS TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THE SUSPECT, DANIEL LOGAN, MAY BE SUFFERING FROM AN INCURABLE NERVOUS DISORDER AND THAT LOGAN WAS UPSET AT THE RECENT ACCIDENTAL DEATH OF HIS SON. OFFICIALS AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE LOGAN WAS BEING TREATED SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT FREE TO COMMENT AT THIS TIME.
