OCTOBER 14, 1965 Stop him! Is the ambassador dead? Someone stop him! Someone's been shot. NOVEMBER 23, 1965 CARDS ON THE TABLE (ATTACK OF THE ROBOTS) MARCH 9, 1966 Don't be a hero! Who do you work for? "Who do you work for..." Stop acting like an idiot! I'm running out of patience! "Pa... ti... en... ce...'' I'll take care of it. This case is of interest to Interpol. Too many similitudes between the ambassador's murder in Buenos Aires and the archbishop's in Amsterdam. Answer! Who are you? Will you talk? Who pays you? ''Who pays you...'' Hello, Chief. You got here quickly. I left London ten minutes after getting your message. - What's going on? - Call it a global carnage. Almost all of the new cabinet members and seven journalists. Unbelievable. Do you have a lead? We caught the killer. He was wounded by one of our guys while trying to flee. Inspector Molynski, he's in charge of the case. Hello, Inspector. Sir. - Did he talk? - Not yet, but we have a film. - A film? What do you mean? - A news reporter was on the scene. He was also wounded, but his camera kept rolling. We'll have the images in an hour or two. Soon as your interrogation is over, I'll take him to London. General Crosby is eagerly awaiting us. - Where's he from? He looks like a mulatto. - I don't know. Stop him! You idiot! - What the hell? - That's unbelievable. His skin color has changed. The palace of the government. They were presenting the new ministers to the press. I see. There's the assassin. - That's where the camera fell down? - Yes, the cameraman was hit. Nice legs! This is no time for joking, Baxter! We were able to identify the dead person. Oscar Hawkie, age 35. Specialized mechanic from Atlanta, Georgia. Disappeared from his home September 4, 1964. Over a year ago. Very well. Let's start at the beginning. The weirdest part is the skin color change after death... from dark-skinned to white-skinned. Did anything like it happen in the past three years? Let me check. "Ingrid Niebauer, student born in Wiesbaden. Disappeared June 12, 1965, in Cologne. Found wounded at Penyal d'Ifac, Spain. Deceased during her transfer to the hospital. Very dark-skinned, changed color while dying. Age 22, single, blue eyes. Particular sign: Rhesus zero." Rhesus zero? - What's so particular about zero? - I have no idea. It's a very rare blood type. That's why we filed it in the report. Every blood group has a rhesus- negative or positive. In extremely rare cases, the rhesus is neutral. That's why we call it rhesus zero. The Hawkie file is in your hand. Of course. How silly of me! Hawkie was a rhesus zero, same as the two who disappeared. Two rhesus zero... Can you get names of all who disappeared without a trace the past three years? That's easy enough, but there are over 2,000 files. Find out if there were any rhesus zero among them. Right away, sir. Yves Barial! A French actor who disappeared. You remember, Baxter? I think I do. It made the news at the time. I was on the case for a while. Rhesus zero. Barial, an American mechanic, a German student... Where was she found? On a beach in Spain. At Ifac, near Alicante. Rings a bell? There it is! Penyal d'Ifac, near Alicante. A French tourist says he met Barial there shortly after his disappearance. He was in a car along with three very dark-skinned men. Very well. Did he have any other contacts? With them? None. We're still on the case. We sent an agent to Alicante. No results. Penyal d'Ifac, a lost corner of Spain, a German student, a French actor... You know what I think, Baxter? Obviously, all these disappearances have something in common. Yes, and what else? Someone has an interest in persons with rhesus zero blood type. Men or women, middle-aged and healthy, all from different places around the world. That's right. You know what we should do? Send somebody over there with rhesus zero blood type. A man in his forties, sturdy, and well trained. Unknowingly, he'd be a bait. The others would abduct him. He'd take us right into the organization. Do we have an agent with rhesus zero? No, unfortunately. We had one before. That's him. - Ai Pereira! - Yes. That's our chance. He should be ready to leave immediately. Of course, he mustn't know that he'll be abducted. He might turn down the mission. Invent some motive. Pereira was one of our best. He nailed Paul Vogel and his gang. You remember, right? Sad for us, he retired and now lives off his pension. We have to contact him. Where can he be reached? That's easy enough. Anywhere in the world, between a pretty blonde and a bottle of scotch. Place your bets, please! Place your bets! You drink too much. All bets are off! Fourteen, red. You know you're sensational? Should we use the same system? What number do I bet on? Bet on 19. It's my age. No cheating in a casino. So bet on 25. Place your bets! All bets are off! Twenty-five, red. Unbelievable! He won again. There's your commission. Write me a bearer check, as per usual. Al Pereira! Al. By God, I hear voices, like Joan of Arc. Come closer. It's me, the statue. All right, here I am. Here, the statue. For a statue, you're pretty cute. What's this? Are you crazy? My name is Lee Wee. You're Ai Pereira? Yes, that's possible. Weight, height, and age? That's a secret I share only with my mother. Okay, no more secrets. I weight 172 pounds! I'm 5'10", and last year, I was in my forties. That's good. And are you rhesus zero? - What? - Are you rhesus zero? Blood, rhesus factor. Oh, yes, I think I remember. - How do you know that? - We have our sources. - You have a cold? - No. Why? Just asking. You're really good. I think so too. Can I go now? - Do you have any ID? - Yes. Passport, ID card, and... Salvation Army membership card. I don't get the joke. Yet, you're Chinese. You have secret documents? Microfilms? Mission orders? Oh! This is ancient history. Do you know anything about the dark-skinned men? And about the eyeglasses? I don't understand Chinese. Good evening, miss. She also works for your services? No, not that. It was such a nice suit. I had it tailor-made in London. These guys are nuts. Who do they think I am? - You like Spain? - Spain? I give you $100,000, and you go to Spain. To do what? Hang out with a pretty blonde, go boating, enjoy the sun. - That's it? - That's it. Do you accept? You go to Spain, at Penyal d'Ifac near Alicante. You execute my orders while pretending to work for the secret services. I retired two years ago. You're back on duty. Trust me. You know more than 1 do. There's something over there that interests us. If you don't accept... Chinese torture. I know the routine. A teacher taught me some tricks. You won't teach old Lee Wee any tricks. Is that so? I'm sure you don't know this one. Or this one! These Chinese are real pig-heads. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Did you have an accident, sir? - No. Everything's fine. What about you? I find you a bit yellowish. Ah, I see. The liver. Be careful with the liver. WE'LL MEET AGAIN SOON. Could you connect me with Allan Maxwell's residence, the American consul? It won't be necessary. I'm here. Baxter, Interpol. A colleague. Rather, an ex-colleague. Pereira, how much do you weight? I weight 172 pounds, I'm 5'10'', and next year I'll be forty-something. - Are you sure about... - Rhesus zero? Absolutely. Tell me, Pereira. - Would you consider a trip to... - Spain. In the vicinity of Penyal d'Ifac. Hang out with a pretty blonde, go boating, enjoy the sun, with a hundred grand in my pocket. Make that 50 grand. And gather HUMINT about the dark-skinned guys. What else? Who told you about this? - Everybody's talking about it. - What? I was on the terrace and got hailed by a statue. She was a real knockout. The Chinese took me to a restaurant, which happened to be an opium den, which it wasn't. A guy named Lee Wee pricked me with sharp bones. He wanted to send me to Spain. When they started messing up my suit, I changed into a tiger and flew out of there. See? He's still drinking. I'm not so sure. I heard about that Lee Wee. He worked for the Vietnamese. - North or South? - Both. If the Chinese are on the case, we shouldn't lose any time. It must be a serious matter. Pereira, the free world needs you. I see what you're getting at. You can't refuse. Uncle Sam will be grateful to you. Make me cry. Thank you, Pereira. I knew you'd accept. Thank you. Here are a few of your weapons. Careful with this umbrella. It explodes when you open it. You expect me to stroll around with this in Spain? Only on rainy days. If it rains, I won't be able to use it. Of course not. It would explode. As for these gloves, they're battery powered. When you wiggle your fingers like this, the batteries recharge. Enough power to electrocute ten adults or 15 kids. When unplugged, the gloves are harmless. What about this hat? Is it "clean"? Absolutely. Be wary of this cigar. Light it only in case of extreme danger, and throw it away fast. It contains a bomb that spreads a lethal gas when it explodes. What about me? Your protection is our utmost priority. This Bic pen is actually a flute. You blow in that little hole. The sound waves break a vial concealed in here. It contains another gas that neutralizes the first gas. - You watch too many James Bond movies. - Many more than you think. Your name is Frank Frobe, and you're from Brooklyn. Ex-boxer turned manager, currently vacationing. Twice divorced, party animal, gambler, good drinker, food-loving, and womanizer. I'll try to remember that. So, why am I going to Spain? We suspect the existence of a new kind of criminal organization. What kind? All these crimes have strange similarities. The victims are well-known figures. Often politicians. The assassins are dark-skinned, and what's most disturbing, they all wear glasses. They operate in broad daylight, with cold-blooded audacity, always following the same method. And there's more. Maxwell and I... think that this woman is in contact with the assassins. Make sure you remember her features. She will be in Alicante next Tuesday. She calls herself Cynthia Lewis. Do you need any help? Not at the moment. Thank you. So, guapo. You're staying or getting on? I'm getting on, hombre. IN ALICANTE, THERE'S JALEO Sorry, I spoiled your cigar. Not this one. It's a gift from my friend Castro. - What a crush! - It's wonderful. Single? - I'm Cynthia. - Frank. - You're a tourist? - No, are you? You could say that. FOR YOUR SALAD ASK FOR JALEO 100% OLIVE So, guapo, you're getting off, or you're staying on? - I'm getting off. - So am i. Such fleeting joy. So long, guapo! Have a good time. Roses and gladiolas are in the crystal vase. Play Valse Triste by Sibelius, but in the key of D minor. - Frank Frobe. - Room 317, sir. Cynthia Lewis. - Is it fate reuniting us? - I certainly hope so. 318, miss. You're together? Yes and no. If you are, there's a communicating door. If you aren't, that door has a lock. Mr. Frobe, there's a message for you. WELCOME TO ALICANTE You're the funny type. It's my most appealing feature. I'm a very simple girl. If you want make sure, come to the Bourbon Club, at midnight. Unless you need some rest. Come on, hurry! Will you need anything else, miss? Hurry up. You're Ai Pereira? What do you care? Scram! Now what? Seems like there's a Chinese boat, moored at dock 26. - How does that concern you? - Someone asked me to tell you. This is X-3. Mission accomplished. I'm very sorry, sir. Hello, ma'am. The flowers haven't been changed. This is the last warning. 1,176. 1,927. Cecilia, you look nervous. What's going on? Test. Hurry. 1,617. 1,833. 923. 4... 327... 16... 08... 4. 1,347. The "Tito" case. Mister One, respond to our agent in Belgrade. His clients have my agreement only if they double the amount. Otherwise, no deal. In London... Did you get an answer from Upper Circle concerning my authorization request? Three. Good. Contact London. We have an agreement on the price and mission Windsor, but 22A must prompt his correspondents. Due to the hazards of this mission, we need at least 15 days of preparation. 1,617. - So? - No doubt. Rhesus zero. Perfect. - You met him here? - Yes. 1,427. 834. 577. 1,347. 1,508. Get their program ready. Carlton Hotel, suite 317. Go wait for him at the hotel and bring him here. I think it's ill advised to operate in this region. We can't take such an initiative without authorization from Upper Circle. - Let me handle this. - But we always recruit abroad. Do you even know this man? I'll find out. I happened to see him in a street fight. Come on, Percy. Don't be angry. Do as I say. Very well. - Do you have a fight? - No, I don't smoke. - Can I sit on that chair? - Sure. Soon as I leave. - Do you dance? - Yes. Go ahead. It doesn't bother me. If by any chance, you'd like to... No, not tonight. By the way, I heard that the cook working on the boat moored at clock 26 has a case of scotch for you. - I never drink. - Did you enjoy my show? Marvelous! Absolutely enchanted. - What bothers me is the audience. - I know, it's a crying shame. If only we could be alone. Hey, guapo! What a surprise. - I got a little something for you. - Really? Are you all right? You're a champ! And we Mexicans are good sports! But if you cross my path again, watch out. Good night, Miss Lewis. - Must we part so quickly? - I'm afraid we must. You're right, Frank. After all, we barely know each other. That's true. Good night. I'm going to have a few words with the concierge. It's 3:00 am, my room hasn't been made up. Everything's a mess. It's ridiculous! Take a look for yourself. What are you doing here? What are you doing there? "What... are... you..." This is the worst time. Hold on, two minutes. "Two... minutes..." - Who's this? - It's me, Cynthia. Oh, shit. - What do you want? - Open up. I need to talk to you. Can't it... Is it urgent? - It can't wait. - I'm not fit to be seen. - I don't care. - Wait one moment. - Open up. - I'll be right there. Open up, or I break down the door. My bathroom is out of order. Can I use yours? - No. - Why'? I never let anyone use my bathroom. It's a matter of principle. - Nobody uses my bathroom. - Please, Frank. Let me take a shower or I won't sleep. I have a book by Marguerite Duras. That'll put you to sleep in no time. - Really, darling? - Oh, sweetie. You make my head swing. - Darling, telephone. - I heard. Stay there. Yes, I hear you. All right, thank you. Good-bye. - There's a corpse in the bathtub. - Really? It makes me a little uncomfortable taking a shower. I know. There are corpses here, almost every night. That's life, but this one is so white and pale. Pale? - We had a lot to drink tonight? - Honestly, yes. Why? Just asking. - You're a very impulsive man, Frank. - That could be. Reckless too. If I were you, I'd hide it. - Yes, but where? - In the wardrobe, as usual. Brilliant. Give me a hand. He'll be more comfortable in there. - What's this thing in his stomach? - A souvenir from the Orient. Not again! You stay in there. It's Madame Tussaud's museum. What is it? Hotel maintenance. - I'm busy. - It's very urgent. What I'm doing now is also very urgent. Coming. - Yes? - We're here to get the wardrobe. The wardrobe! Excellent idea. Good night, Mr. Frobe. Alone at last. What about Pereira? He hasn't been abducted yet? We've tried, but the Chinese... Yes, I know! Meanwhile, as you know, in London, Lord Hensley was assassinated in broad daylight, halfway through his lunch. Same narrative. Dark-skinned man with glasses, and he managed to flee. How long will this nonsense last? And Olsen? What the hell is he doing? Haven't heard from him. Not only did you fail, but you lost Mr. Eight. And you didn't know you had to kill him before leaving. Enough! Out of here! There's no point in blaming them. The plan was jinxed. Once is enough. It was unconceivable for you to take such an initiative without authorization from Upper Circle. We failed. Let's hope they don't find out. Forget about Frank Frobe. Pleasure to meet you again. Likewise. - You finally decided to come. - You were so insistent. This time, I'm not wearing a tux, because the dry cleaner cost me a fortune. I'm elated, Mr. Pereira. Will you accept our conditions? Why not? What do you expect from me? Why are you here, Mr. Pereira? If we keep asking questions, we'll still be here come Christmas. I'll answer you, Mr. Pereira. We're here for the same reasons. Chinese subtlety puzzles me. I have nothing to hide from you. You know as well as I do that a criminal organization is hiding in this region. It just happens that the members of that organization... How should we call them? The... The killers. These killers seem to be remote-controlled. Like puppets or automatons. We want the scientific process that allows this transformation. That's all. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to locate the organization or its leaders. I see that you know as much as I do. Our secret services are on par with yours. Certainly. Nevertheless, since I have nothing to do here, I'll be on my way. May the best team win. Wait. Why were you sent to Alicante, Mr. Pereira? - You know it perfectly well. - I do, but you don't. This is getting exciting. I think so too. You were sent here to be abducted by the criminal organization. - Is that so? - You're rhesus zero? It appears that only those who possess this characteristic are likely to undergo the treatment transforming a man into a robot. Your superiors knew that, but they were afraid that you'd turn down the mission if they told you the truth. You're asking me to get abducted on purpose? I see you live up to your reputation. Only an old cranky bureaucrat could think that a Pereira would let himself be abducted of his own volition. You're making me blush. - How much? -500 grand. It's a pretty hefty sum. It's worth the risks. And you insist that I change into an Automat? We'll do everything we can to spare you this ordeal. That's sweet of you. Allow me to give you this pistol. When you're stuck in the ruckus, shoot up, and we'll rush to rescue. - It's in good working order? - Of course. Very good then. Do you know this girl? Yes and no. Yes and no... as the Normans say. Hi there. Tell your friends to stop barging into my room. You little weasel, you. Hello. Who allowed you in, sir? This happens to be my room, and I'm paying for it. And then some... - You? - I'm Lady Cecilia Addington Courtney. You're very welcoming, Mr. Frobe. You know my name? I've been wanting to know you since the clay I saw you fight on the street. Oh, that was nothing at all. Oh, yes, it was wonderful. I thought the best way to know you was to pay you a visit. That's brilliant. Will you pardon my intrusion? You're absolved. - Are you here on vacation? - Supposedly, but now that you're here... Tell me about you, Mr. Frobe. Why? We have better things to do. Feels so good to cuddle up. You should've been here last night. It was quite a party. Really? Tell me about it. - It'd take too long. - So come over to my place. We can pursue this conversation in a more casual atmosphere. Isn't my place casual enough? Hotel rooms lack intimacy, and one of your friends could drop in unexpectedly. That wouldn't be a problem. Excuse me. I wouldn't want to break my glasses. - They're yours? - Yes. - They look strange. - They look good on me. - Don't they? - You're crazy! - What's wrong? - You're more handsome without glasses. Come on. I'm abducting you! Give me back my glasses. No, I'll keep them as a souvenir. I hate to be aggressive with women, but don't push me. - You wouldn't dare. - Oh, I sure would. What a pity, Mr. Frobe. Just as romance was setting in... You're much too intelligent for an ex-boxer. It keeps you from enjoying the simpler things in life. Let yourself go, Mr. Frobe. Don't overthink it. Just a friendly word of advice. Cynthia! Step back. Keep going. I was suspicious of you. Everything's clear now. Lee Wee pays good money? Why are you working for the Chinese? It was a bad idea. I'm real sorry. Step back! Frank! Where are you? Come back! 927. 2,087. - Where's she from? - Lisbon. 1,833. 423. 1,427. 834. 279. 1,833. 423. 1,427. 834. She's almost perfect. 277. This is Upper Circle. I have more unpleasant news. People in the know have confirmed your assumptions. The man on the picture you showed me is not trustworthy. Do what's necessary. Besides, one of your neighbors might cause you some trouble. He just settled in. His name is Pereira and goes by the name of Frobe. I'm counting on you. My best regards to Sir Percy. Good-bye. You seem preoccupied, Cecilia. Enemies are all around us. Prepare a program. I received confirmation about this man being dangerous. We have to get rid of him. We'll take care of the rest later. Pereira, you better leave town. Fast! We work for the same people. I'm fried. The Automats will get me. You can't be seen with me. Hurry! Leave this place! Are you armed? Thanks. Yves Barial. What's going on, Percy? I don't understand what's going on with Mr. One. - He was supposed to pick up Olsen's ID? - Yes, but... Modify his program! Have him return immediately. Guide him in. Hey, guapo! Where you going? Can you hear me? Are you scared? What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Poor guapo. Cynthia! What's going on? I was so scared. I thought you were like them. Them? These pathetic monsters. So, your Chinese friends let you down? Don't get me started with the Chinese. I wanted to see what made them tick. I work at Interpol. My name is Al Pereira. And you, who do you work for? I also work at Interpol. They told me to trail you, saying you were dangerous. Bastards! They shoved me in harm's way. What are we going to do, darling? Let's get out of here. Not so soon. It was hard enough to get in. How did you get here? I don't know. I put on these glasses, and they led me here. This is where they assemble the robots, the automated assassins. You get it? The people running this place are wackos. Their robots can kill anyone. Why do they do this? It's for some kind of crime organization. - You're also rhesus zero? - Yes. Why? Just asking. It's so fashionable these days. Mr. Pereira. Now we know who you are. Follow me, please. After you. I can't go in, but we'll met again, Mr. Pereira. Go in. Come closer, please. Sit down. I was eager to carry on our conversation. Forgive me for leaving in a huff yesterday. It's only natural. I admire you very much, Mr. Pereira. You got rid of Mr. One and almost defeated my plans. It took some courage to wear these glasses and throw yourself in the lion's mouth. I would've done anything to see you again. You should've come earlier. You'll see. We'll work together. Everything will be so easy with you. Can't you ask these guys out of the room? I wouldn't want you to bang me... or hurt me. I'd never harm you. They just make me feel uneasy. They reassure me. Have no fear. They're devoid of any feeling. Too bad for them. - Really? - Really. They're exemplary servants. What do you do for a living, ma'am? Who cares, Mr. Pereira? I care that you're here. You won't regret it. That's for sure. Too bad you wouldn't listen when I told you to enjoy the simpler things in life. Nobody's perfect, you know. Kiss me. Why, Cecilia? Upper Circle's order. He has to die, and so does she. 834. 577. 1,347. 1,508. 225. 577. 1,347. 487. 1,676. 1,927. 2,085. 1,523. 1,422. 423. 9... Not that! They can only execute one program. Bring the levers down! Hurry! Cynthia! Good evening. Congratulations, Mr. Pereira. We won. I hope all these emotions won't keep you from enjoying the trip. This should you make you feel right at home. Very kind of you, but what do you want from us? You come and work for us. No way. Lady Cecilia's secrets are mine until I get the 50 grand. You're very amusing, Mr. Pereira! The secret of these two wackos is ours, and you can't take it back. I protest. This is a breach of trust. Get real, Mr. Pereira. If you didn't have to call us to the rescue, would you have brought back the documents? Of course not! You would've passed them on to your bosses. Goes without saying. So who's the crook here? You have to amend yourself. You will work for us. It's your last word? Almost. Poor Mr. Pereira, you've been fooled all the way. Your superiors didn't want you to defend against an abduction, so they provided you with useless weapons. Like this cigar. A cheap stogie! Or these electric gloves. A hoax! Or this umbrella that's supposed to explode when you open it! Jump! Hurry! Oh, shit! Us again! Hey, guapo ! What a surprise. Come aboard. How's the water? Nice and warm. Great to see you again. Ain't much fish around. I missed you. Only this time, I won't miss... you! We'll meet again! THE END
