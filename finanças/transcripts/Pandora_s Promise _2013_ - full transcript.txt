THE ATOM WAS GOING TO BRING ABOUT A WONDERFUL REVOLUTION IN -- IN THE WAY WE GOT OUR ENERGY. AND THERE WAS A NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINE, THE NAUTILUS, THAT WENT UNDER THE NORTH POLE, AND US KIDS WERE REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT. AND THEN, WHEN I WAS IN MY EARLY TEENS, ADMIRAL RICKOVER CAME TO GIVE A SPEECH. AND MY DAD KNEW I WAS INTERESTED IN SCIENCE, SO HE TOOK ME. >> WATCH THE CONTROL RODS COME OUT.

AND HE TALKED ABOUT NUCLEAR ENERGY BEING USED TO LIGHT UP CITIES, NOT JUST RUN SUBMARINES. SO, IT WAS A GENERALLY POSITIVE NOTION. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] >> I GOT INTO THE NUCLEAR BUSINESS IN EARLY 1948. PRIOR TO THAT, I WAS WORKING ON ENGINES FOR THE TUCKER AUTOMOBILE. [ BELL DINGS ] EVERYTHING WE HAD DONE UP UNTIL THAT TIME TO PRODUCE ENERGY WAS BY BURNING SOMETHING. THE ENTICEMENT IN THE NUCLEAR BUSINESS WAS THE FACT THAT IT WAS A NEW SOURCE OF ENERGY, A NEW WAY TO GENERATE HEAT. BUT THE EQUIVALENCY IS HUGE. ONE POUND OF URANIUM, WHICH IS THE SIZE OF MY FINGERTIP, IF YOU COULD RELEASE ALL OF THE ENERGY, HAS THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT 5,000 BARRELS OF OIL... AND THAT, TO ME, IS AMAZING. I WORKED AT ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY IN IDAHO, WHICH REALLY WAS THE HEADQUARTERS IN THE WORLD FOR NUCLEAR POWER AT THE TIME. WE WERE BUILDING THIS FIRST-IN-THE-WORLD EXPERIMENTAL BREEDER REACTOR. EBR-I WAS AN EXPERIMENT JUST TO PROVE THAT THE CONCEPT MADE SENSE, SCIENTIFICALLY. EVERYTHING HAPPENED JUST LIKE WE EXPECTED IT TO. THE REACTORS WENT CRITICAL. "CRITICAL" MEANS YOU JUST -- YOU HAVE ENOUGH URANIUM SO THAT IT GENERATES HEAT. ALL THE REACTOR DOES IS GENERATES HEAT. THE END PRODUCT IS STEAM, AND THEN, ONCE YOU HAVE STEAM, IT'S THE SAME WHETHER YOU GENERATE THE ELECTRICITY WITH OIL OR COAL OR GAS OR -- JUST AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A SOURCE OF HEAT. SO, WE GENERATED ELECTRICITY, AND THEN WE HOOKED UP FOUR LIGHT BULBS, AND WE LIT THE LIGHT BULBS FROM ATOMIC ENERGY. NOBODY ELSE HAD DONE IT BEFORE. BUT THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE NUCLEAR BUSINESS, ATOMIC ENERGY, WAS STARTED FOR A BOMB AND USED AS A BOMB, AND I THINK THAT PUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE ON IT. >> I'M JUST OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE CONSCIOUS MEMORY OF WORLD WAR II... AND THE ENDING OF WORLD WAR II. NUCLEAR BOMBS WERE NOT JUST A WEAPON -- THEY WERE A LITTLE WINDOW INTO SOME KIND OF ARMAGEDDON. THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE FILMS AND THE STORIES THAT CAME OUT OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI -- THOSE THINGS CUT PRETTY DEEP. SO, YOU HAD THIS VERY STRONG RESIDUE OF, "OH, THIS IS NOT PRIMARILY AN ENERGY SOURCE -- THIS IS PRIMARILY A WEAPON," THAT WE FEEL VERY BADLY ABOUT. [ EXPLOSION ] AND THEN THE TESTING WENT ON AND ON. WE WERE HEARING ABOUT THE RADIATION FROM THAT AND STRONTIUM 90. AND THEN THE RUSSIANS WERE DOING TESTS. THE CHINESE WERE DOING TESTS. AND BEFORE IT REALLY SLOWED DOWN, THERE WERE OVER 2,000 TESTS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. [ SIREN BLARES ] I GREW UP HAVING NIGHTMARES THAT MY HOMETOWN WAS BOMBED INTO OBLIVION AND I WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

WHO ARE THE CRIMINALS?! >> I WAS WRITING FOR NATIONAL MAGAZINES MANY YEARS AGO, WRITING ARTICLES ABOUT THE DANGERS OF NUCLEAR POWER. AND I HAD THE STANDARD POINT OF VIEW THAT I THINK MANY JOURNALISTS STILL HAVE, THAT IT MUST BE BAD. I CAME TO REALIZE THEY BASICALLY AVOIDED LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PICTURE AND ONLY LOOKED AT THE QUESTIONS THAT SEEMED TO PROVE TO THEM THAT NUCLEAR POWER WAS DANGEROUS, AS I HAD, TOO. THE ONLY REASON I CHANGED MY MIND IS THAT I TALKED TO EXPERTS, PHYSICISTS IN PARTICULAR, WHO WERE THE PIONEERS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY AND WHO CAREFULLY, ONE BY ONE, EXPLAINED TO ME AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL IT FINALLY GOT THROUGH MY HEAD WHY IT WASN'T WHAT THE ANTINUCLEAR ACTIVISTS FELT IT WAS, BELIEVED IT WAS. >> I WAS RIGHT THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS. IT WAS MY CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING FOR HUMANKIND. THIS, AFTER ALL, WAS AN UNLIMITED SOURCE OF ENERGY. I ASSUMED THAT ALL ELECTRICAL POWER, IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL, WOULD BE GENERATED BY NUCLEAR MEANS. IN THE '50s, THERE WERE, ESSENTIALLY, TWO KINDS OF REACTORS BEING DEVELOPED -- THE BREEDER REACTOR, WHICH EBR-I WAS A PROTOTYPE FOR, AND THE LIGHT WATER REACTOR. THE BREEDER REACTOR BREEDS PLUTONIUM AND CAN RECYCLE IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- IT'S A VERY GOOD FUEL. [ CHUCKLES ] THE LIGHT WATER REACTOR IS A MUCH SIMPLER REACTOR, BUT IT PRODUCES MUCH MORE WASTE. IT WAS CHOSEN BY ADMIRAL RICKOVER TO BE THE REACTOR FOR THE SUBMARINE. THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO BE SAID FOR LIGHT WATER REACTORS AND THERE'S SOME TO BE SAID AGAINST THEM. BUT WITH RICKOVER'S INFLUENCE, THE LIGHT WATER REACTOR BECAME THE PRINCIPAL COMMERCIAL REACTOR AROUND THE WORLD. >> WE DEVELOPED WATER REACTORS, BUT WE LOOKED UPON THAT AS SORT OF A NEAR-TERM, SHORT-RANGE STEPPING STONE TO REAL NUCLEAR POWER, THE BREEDER REACTOR. THAT'S WHAT WE CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST LIKELY REAL LONG-RANGE FUTURE FOR NUCLEAR POWER. BUT THE WATER REACTOR GOT MARKETED FIRST. [ HORN HONKS ] >> THIS WAS PARTLY A COMMERCIAL MOVE ON OUR PART. IN THE EARLY 1950s, WE WERE CONCERNED THAT THE SOVIET UNION, WHICH HAD KEPT PACE WITH US IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR REACTORS FOR POWER, WOULD STEAL A MARCH ON US AND GET THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS IN EUROPE. SO, PRESIDENT EISENHOWER DECIDED TO SHARE THE BENEFITS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. IT WAS CALLED "ATOMS FOR PEACE." >> WE'VE HAD 50 YEARS NOW OF WATER REACTORS, 400 OF 'EM, ROUGHLY, ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND THEY'VE PRODUCED A HELL OF A LOT OF WASTE THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE. YOU KNOW, YOU MENTION 100,000 YEARS OF STUFF THAT YOU GOT TO KEEP ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, THAT'S ENOUGH TO SCARE A LOT OF PEOPLE. THAT WAS, PERHAPS, THE PRICE WE PAID FOR COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE SENSE THAT WE DIDN'T LOOK AHEAD. >> NUCLEAR POWER WAS DEVELOPED AS A KIND OF A BOUTIQUE ENERGY SOURCE BY UTILITIES EXECUTIVES WHO REALLY DIDN'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT. I TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO SAID, "WELL, I HEARD ABOUT IT ON THE GOLF COURSE FROM THE GUY WHO RUNS THE PLANT DOWN THE ROAD. HE'S GONNA BUILD ONE, AND SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD, TOO." THE FIRST COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT THAT WAS BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES WAS BUILT IN SHIPPINGPORT, PENNSYLVANIA. IT WAS A MODIFIED VERSION OF A LARGE SUBMARINE REACTOR. ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS THE POWER COMPANY WANTED IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF COAL POLLUTION IN PITTSBURGH, AND NUCLEAR ENERGY LOOKED TO PEOPLE TO BE, AS IT IS, A CLEAN FORM OF ENERGY. THE FIRST POWER REACTORS WERE FAIRLY SMALL, BUT THE PUSH BY THE POWER AND LIGHT COMPANIES OF AMERICA WAS TO SCALE THEM UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SAFETY, INSTEAD OF BEING INHERENT IN THE DESIGN OF THE REACTOR ITSELF, HAD TO BE ENGINEERED AROUND IT, AS IT WERE. YOU HAD TO HAVE MULTIPLE CORE COOLING SYSTEMS THAT HAD TO BE ADDED ON TO ANTICIPATE POSSIBLE BREAKDOWNS OF VARIOUS KINDS. THE ODDS OF "X" HAPPENING OR "Y" HAPPENING WERE VERY SMALL. BUT UNLIKE THOSE SMALLER REACTORS, THEY REALLY COULDN'T SAY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. >> LATE TODAY, OFFICIALS HERE IN WASHINGTON SUMMARIZED BRIEFLY WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM. FIRST, A PUMP IN THE GENERATOR SYSTEM BROKE DOWN AT 4:00 A.M. YESTERDAY. THE REACTOR IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN. REACTOR OPERATORS DECIDED TO OPEN THE VALVES AND RELEASE RADIOACTIVE WATER FROM THE REACTOR. THAT, APPARENTLY, MAY HAVE BEEN THE WRONG THING TO DO. WHEN THE EMERGENCY CORE COOLING SYSTEM CAME ON AUTOMATICALLY, AN OPERATOR TURNED IT OFF. THAT, TOO, APPARENTLY, WAS A MISTAKE, FOR THEN HIGH LEVELS OF RADIATION WERE RELEASED INSIDE THE CONTAINMENT BUILDING. AND NOT TILL THREE HOURS LATER WAS IT REALIZED THAT RADIATION WAS BEING RELEASED AND, IN FACT, WAS PENETRATING TO THE OUTSIDE. >> THREE MILE ISLAND HAPPENED. AND THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF IS, "ARE THOSE RAYS COMING OUT OF THREE MILE ISLAND GONNA COME TO NEW YORK AND HARM MY DAUGHTER?" I REMEMBER STANDING IN MY APARTMENT AND THINKING, "WHAT CAN -- YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN WE DO?" >> THIS IS JACK GODELL. WE HAVE A SERIOUS CONDITION.

SO I WAS ALREADY PREPARED TO BE TERRORIZED BY THIS EVENT. >> THE CHINA SYNDROME. >> THE WHAT? >> IF THE CORE IS EXPOSED, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THE FUEL HEATS BEYOND... >> THE IDEA BEHIND "THE CHINA SYNDROME" IS THAT THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WOULD MELT DOWN -- IT WOULD BURROW A HOLE ALL THE WAY TO CHINA. [ Chuckling ] NEVER MIND THAT CHINA'S NOT ACTUALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EARTH AS THE UNITED STATES. BUT THAT WAS THE IDEA -- THAT IT WOULD -- THAT -- THAT THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE APOCALYPTIC. >> THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED WOULD DEPEND ON WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING -- RENDER AN AREA THE SIZE OF PENNSYLVANIA PERMANENTLY UNINHABITABLE, NOT TO MENTION THE CANCER THAT WOULD SHOW UP LATER. >> THAT'S WHEN I THINK I BEGAN TO CONFLATE NUCLEAR POWER WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. >> ...FROM A LEAKING NUCLEAR PLANT. >> WE DON'T WANT A RADIOACTIVE WASTELAND, WHETHER IT'S FROM A BOMB OR A NUCLEAR PLANT. THAT KIND OF -- THAT'S PROBABLY THE SORT OF THING I WOULD HAVE ANSWERED. IT JUST SEEMED LIKE, "OKAY, NUCLEAR ANYTHING IS A BAD IDEA." >> I WANT TO JUST SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE CHINA SYNDROME, MY MOVIE, "THE CHINA SYNDROME," BECAUSE IF WE CONTINUE TO PLACE OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE HANDS OF UTILITY EXECUTIVES WHOSE MAIN GOAL IN LIFE IS TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS, THEN WE WILL SEE MORE HARRISBURGS, WE WILL SEE MORE LEAKS, AND WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN THE CANCER EPIDEMIC THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING RAMPANT IN THIS COUNTRY.

FOR ONE THING, IT TURNS OUT THE ADS WERE PLACED BY THE OIL-DELIVERY INDUSTRY -- YOU KNOW, THE COMPANIES THAT DELIVER FUEL TO PEOPLE IN LONG ISLAND. AND, SURE, THE OIL COMPANIES CAN SAY, "GO SOLAR," 'CAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S NEVER GOING TO REPLACE OIL HEAT. YOU CANNOT TURN ON THE SUN IN THE WINTER AND HOPE TO WARM UP YOUR HOUSE. GOOD LUCK.

THEY KNOW -- I MEAN, THIS IS THE CYNICISM OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. >> SHOREHAM WAS ACTUALLY FINISHED AND STARTED UP, AND THEN IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE AND BASICALLY MOTHBALLED. IT WAS THIS IMMENSE INVESTMENT, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, IN A REACTOR WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN OF GREAT USE TO NEW YORK CITY, BUT PEOPLE WERE SO AFRAID OF IT THAT THEY SIMPLY SAID, "SHUT IT DOWN." AND TODAY, IT'S A MAUSOLEUM. THOSE OF US WHO WERE WORRIED ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER PERCEIVED THAT NUCLEAR POWER WASN'T REALLY NEEDED. AND THIS, I THINK, IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL TRAGEDIES OF THE ANTINUCLEAR MOVEMENT -- TO BE ANTINUCLEAR IS BASICALLY TO BE IN FAVOR OF BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. I HAD, FINALLY, TO CHANGE MY MIND. AND I HAVE SEEN FRIENDS OF MINE CHANGE THEIR MINDS, ONE OF THEM BEING GWYNETH CRAVENS, WHO STARTED OUT RATHER ANTINUCLEAR, AS I DID, AND ENDED UP WRITING A BOOK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF NUCLEAR POWER.

[ BRAKES SQUEAL ] [ HORN HONKS ] >> MOST PEOPLE KIND OF THINK THAT, SOMEHOW, WE'RE GONNA BE REDUCING OUR ENERGY CONSUMPTION. ACTUALLY, WE JUST FIND MORE AND MORE USES FOR IT.

AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THAT NUMBER EXACTLY RIGHT, BUT YOU REALIZE WE'RE GONNA BASICALLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE CONSUME BY 2050. WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA TRIPLE IT OR QUADRUPLE IT BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. AND MEANWHILE, IF YOU WANT TO STABILIZE EMISSIONS AT SOME REASONABLE LEVEL, ALMOST ALL OF THAT ENERGY HAS TO BE CLEAN ENERGY. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO NOT ONLY, YOU KNOW, CREATE A CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO REPLACE THE FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE, BUT WE HAVE TO CREATE YET ANOTHER ONE, OR MAYBE TWO OF THEM, BETWEEN NOW AND 2050 OR 2100 IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS TO STABILIZE THE CLIMATE. AND THAT IS JUST NOTHING THAT ANYBODY HAS REALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT OR DEALING WITH OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. IT COMES AS A SHOCK TO A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO HEAR THIS, BUT COAL IS NOT ONLY THE MOST WIDELY USED SOURCE OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD -- IT'S ALSO THE FASTEST-GROWING SOURCE OF ENERGY. ITS USE IS ACCELERATING WORLDWIDE FASTER THAN NATURAL GAS, FASTER THAN RENEWABLES, FASTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. >> WHEN I HAVE SPOKEN TO WOMEN'S GROUPS, NONE OF THEM KNEW HOW BAD COAL WAS. THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT KILLED PEOPLE. IF YOU ADD UP ALL FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST FROM POWER PLANTS, YOU'LL FIND PARTICULATES ALONE KILL 13,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. WORLDWIDE, 3 MILLION PEOPLE DIE A YEAR FROM AIR POLLUTION FROM FOSSIL FUEL PLANTS. >> ONE OF THE BIG SURPRISES FOR ME WHEN I STARTED LOOKING INTO THE MORTALITY DATA, THE DEATH RATES, ASSOCIATED WITH EACH ENERGY TECHNOLOGY PER AMOUNT OF ENERGY THEY MAKE, IS THAT NUCLEAR IS THE SECOND SAFEST AFTER WIND. AND IN FACT, TO ADD TO THE IRONY OF IT, NUCLEAR POWER IS EVEN SAFER THAN SOLAR PANELS. [ CHUCKLES ] MAKING SOLAR PANELS IS AN INCREDIBLY TOXIC PROCESS. BUT, I MEAN, I THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE DIED AT THREE MILE ISLAND. I THOUGHT THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIED AT CHERNOBYL. I THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS NUCLEAR WASTE SCATTERED ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THAT IT WAS SEEPING INTO OUR WATER SYSTEMS. I BELIEVED ALL THAT STUFF. AND I -- AND I THOUGHT, EVEN IF MAYBE IT WAS GETTING A LITTLE BIT BETTER OR MAYBE IF IT WERE -- IF THE PROBLEMS OF IT WERE EXAGGERATED A LITTLE BIT BY MY FELLOW ENVIRONMENTALISTS THAT IT WAS STILL A RISK THAT WE DIDN'T NEED TO TAKE. [ "WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN" PLAYS ] >> THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE DEATH FROM THE OPERATION OF COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR REACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES -- NOT ONE DEATH IN THE HISTORY OF NUCLEAR POWER IN THIS COUNTRY. AT VERMONT YANKEE, WHICH ANTINUCLEAR PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SHUT DOWN, PROTESTERS KEEP SAYING IT'S CAUSING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. IT'S NOT. >> BUT IT'S LEAKING TRITIUM. >> IT'S LEAKING TRITIUM -- THAT'S TRUE. >> BANANA BREAK? >> OH, I'D LOVE ONE. >> SURE. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. >> IF YOU ATE ONE BANANA... >> BANANA BREAK? >> ...WHICH HAVE A POTASSIUM ISOTOPE THAT'S A LITTLE HOT, YOU WOULD GET MORE RADIATION EXPOSURE... >> BANANA BREAK? >> ...THAN YOU WOULD IF YOU DRANK... >> BANANA BREAK! >> ...ALL THE WATER... >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> ...THAT COMES OUT OF THE PLANT IN ONE DAY. >> BANANA BREAK! >> TRITIUM IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING HYDROGEN ISOTOPE. >> WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO RISK ARREST REMAIN IN THIS SAFETY ZONE UNTIL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE MOVED UP. [ CROWD CHANTS "SHUT IT DOWN" ] >> IN NEW MEXICO, WHERE I GREW UP, THERE'S RADIUM SPRINGS. AND...I HAD A FRIEND WHO WENT WITH HIS GEIGER COUNTER. AND THE -- THESE HIPPIES WERE THERE, SOAKING IN THE BATHS. AND HE GOT OUT HIS GEIGER COUNTER AND SAID, "YOU KNOW, THIS IS RADIOACTIVE." AND THEY SAID, "YEAH, MAN, BUT IT'S NATURAL." [ BIRD CALLING ] >> IT'S TRUE TO SAY THAT WE'RE ALL BATHED IN NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY. IT'S AFFECTING ALL OF US ALL THE TIME. IT COMES FROM THE ROCKS AND THE AIR AND EVEN FROM SPACE. IT'S IN OUR FOOD, IN OUR WATER, IN OUR TEETH. SO, RADIATION ISN'T DANGEROUS IN AN EVERYDAY SENSE. AND THERE'S ENORMOUS VARIATION IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS, JUST TO PUT THAT IN A KIND OF A CONTEXT? >> WELL, THE NUMBERS -- I MEAN, THE UNITS ARE DIFFICULT. IT'S GRAYS AND MILLIREMS AND ALL THIS KIND OF THING. >> RIGHT. >> YOU KNOW, SO THE NUMBERS ARE NOT FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. IF I SAY TO YOU, "THE RADIOACTIVITY -- OH, IT'S ONLY ANOTHER 4 MICROSIEVERTS," ARE YOU GONNA FEEL BETTER ABOUT THAT? OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH I'M TALKING ABOUT. >> THIS -- IODINE 131. >> ANYWHERE... >> THE REPORTING OF RADIATION LEVELS ARE AS CONFUSING AS THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE. >> ...HAS JUST ABOUT 0.7 REM. YOU HAVE TO GET UP TO 50 TO 75 REM TO GET... >> WE HEAR ABOUT REMS AND MILLIREMS AND MICROREMS. AND THEN -- OH, NOW THERE'S SIEVERTS. WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT SIEVERTS AND MICROSIEVERTS, MILLISIEVERTS. AND YOU'RE -- YOU'RE LOOKING AND SQUINTING AND, "OKAY, THAT LOOKS LIKE A LARGE NUMBER. IS -- IS THAT A NUMBER I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT? AND COMPARED TO WHAT?" [ BEEPING ] WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVEL RELATIVE TO ALL THIS? >> [ Chuckling ] I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS NATURAL BACKGROUND RADIATION, ACTUALLY. I HAD ASSUMED THAT RADIATION WAS SOMETHING WHICH HUMANS HAD ARTIFICIALLY INTRODUCED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WAS DOING US HARM. [ BEEPING ] THERE'S BACKGROUND RADIOACTIVITY AFFECTING ALL OF US ALL THE TIME, WHICH IS MANY, MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN -- THAN ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVITY, IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE AFFECTED. SO, ZERO TOLERANCE OF RADIATION DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. [ BEEPING ] RADIATION INCREASES WITH ALTITUDE, SO PEOPLE WHO LIVE AT HIGH ALTITUDE GET A HIGHER DOSE THAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN LOW-LYING AREAS. AND IF YOU'RE TRAVELING ON AN AIRPLANE -- SAY IF YOU'RE GOING FROM NEW YORK TO TOKYO -- YOU'LL GET 20 TIMES THE AVERAGE BACKGROUND LEVEL DURING THAT FLIGHT. [ BEEPING ] FOR EXAMPLE, IN GUARAPARI BEACH IN BRAZIL, THE NATURAL BACKGROUND RADIATION THERE IS WAY ABOVE PERMITTED LEVELS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PUBLIC CAN BE EXPOSED TO, AND THAT'S WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THE SOIL -- IT'S ON THE BEACH. >> [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] >> CAN YOU ASK HIM WHY HE DOES THIS? >> [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] >> YOU KNOW? >> AND THIS HELPS? IT HELPS. >> AND WHAT'S REALLY STRIKING IS THAT THERE'S NO CORRELATION BETWEEN LEVELS OF BACKGROUND RADIOACTIVITY, WHICH VARY BY SUCH ENORMOUS AMOUNTS, AND HIGH LEVELS OF CANCER. CANCER IS SOMETHING WHICH IS -- IS THE GREATEST FEAR OF MOST PEOPLE IN RICH COUNTRIES BECAUSE IT KILLS 20% OF PEOPLE, ANYWAY. WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE WHO'VE DIED OF CANCER, AND SO THIS IDEA THAT RADIOACTIVITY IS A CAUSE OF CANCER IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER-ONE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF IT. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] YOU CAN'T GO TO CHERNOBYL AND NOT RE-EXAMINE YOUR CORE BELIEFS ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER. I MEAN, YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE REALLY THICKHEADED NOT -- NOT TO LOOK AT THAT AND LOOK AT THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE AND SAY, "ALL RIGHT. WHEN IT GOES WRONG -- YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE IT GO RIGHT. BUT WHEN IT GOES WRONG, IT CAN GO REALLY VERY WRONG, INDEED." CHERNOBYL WAS A -- A REAL-WORLD EXPERIMENT OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU IRRADIATE A VERY LARGE POPULATION. BUT 1986 WAS A LONG TIME AGO. SO, WE'VE GOT THE PERSPECTIVE AND THE DISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT THE REAL IMPACTS OF THAT WERE. [ BEEPING ] AND THEY'RE NOTHING -- NOTHING LIKE WHAT -- WHAT WAS EXPECTED. THE REACTOR THAT EXPLODED IN CHERNOBYL IN APRIL 1986 WAS ACTUALLY NUMBER 4, REACTOR NUMBER 4 OF A WHOLE SET OF THEM. NO ONE REALLY REALIZES IT -- THE THREE OTHER UNITS, WHICH ARE IN THE SAME BUILDING, CARRIED ON OPERATING AND GENERATING ELECTRICITY RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MID-'90s. AND PEOPLE JUST WENT TO WORK THERE EVERY DAY. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? >> OUTSIDE OF THE OLD SOVIET UNION, WE DIDN'T USE THE REACTOR DESIGN THAT CHERNOBYL HAD. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CHERNOBYL REACTOR HAD NO CONTAINMENT BUILDING. IT WAS IN VIRTUALLY A QUONSET HUT. SO, WHEN THERE WAS A FIRE AND AN EXPLOSION, THERE WAS NOTHING TO CONTAIN IT. >> CHERNOBYL WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF REACTOR. IT WAS INHERENTLY UNSAFE. IT WAS PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO MAKE PLUTONIUM FOR BOMBS. NO CHERNOBYL-STYLE REACTORS WERE EVER BUILT IN THE WEST. BUT IF YOU COULD THEN POINT TO OTHER NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS AND SAY, "EACH OF THOSE COULD BE A CHERNOBYL," THEN YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY POWERFUL ARGUMENT AGAINST NUCLEAR POWER. THE CITY NEARBY CALLED "PRIPYAT" -- THE ENTIRE PLACE WAS EVACUATED WHEN CHERNOBYL BLEW UP. IT'S JUST FASCINATING TO SEE SOMEPLACE WHICH IS FROZEN IN TIME, IN THIS -- AT THE VERY END OF THE ERA OF THE SOVIET UNION. IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE. I-I REALLY CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. IT'S A BIT LIKE THE FUKUSHIMA THING IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE TRAMPING AROUND ON THIS DEBRIS OF BROKEN GLASS AND BROKEN EVERYTHING, AND -- AND IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE EXPLOSION AT CHERNOBYL HAD SOMEHOW CAUSED THIS... BUT, OF COURSE, IT DIDN'T. IT'S JUST THE DECAY OF TIME AND THINGS HAVE BEEN BROKEN. OBVIOUSLY, WHAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH CHERNOBYL IS THE -- IS THE RADIOACTIVITY. [ BELLS TOLLING ] I NEVER KNEW UNTIL I WENT TO CHERNOBYL THAT THERE ARE PLACES FULL OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST DECIDED TO IGNORE THE RESTRICTIONS AND JUST MOVED BACK TO THEIR HOUSES. AND YOU CAN GO TO THIS OLD CHURCH, AND YOU CAN MEET THEM. [ CHANTING ] [ BEEPING ] >> LET'S ASK HIM WHEN AND WHY DID HE DECIDE TO COME BACK AND HOW MANY -- HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME WITH HIM? >> [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] [ BEEPING ] >> THE EXPLOSION OF THE REACTOR AT CHERNOBYL HAD ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES, BUT NOT THE ONES I THINK MANY PEOPLE EXPECT. I FOLLOWED THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BY INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS IN RADIATION AND ONCOLOGY THAT FOLLOWED THE DAMAGE AT CHERNOBYL FOR ALL THE YEARS SINCE. THE DAMAGE THAT WAS CAUSED TO PEOPLE BY THE FALLOUT FROM THAT WORST OF ALL NUCLEAR POWER ACCIDENTS HAS BEEN REMARKABLY LIMITED. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. IT'S ALL BEEN PUBLISHED. IT'S BEEN CERTIFIED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. >> WHAT'S SO STRIKING IS JUST TO GO READ THE ORIGINAL WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTS, THEN READ THE PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS. >> WAS THAT A SHOCK TO YOU? >> IT WAS A COMPLETE SHOCK TO ME. I MEAN, I -- THERE WAS A PERIOD WHERE I'M READING ALL THE CHERNOBYL STUFF AND I -- I'M -- I KIND OF AM NOT BELIEVING IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO OUT OF SYNC WITH WHAT I HAD COME TO BELIEVE. >> LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE CLEAR-UP OPERATION. THEY'RE KNOWN AS "LIQUIDATORS." AND THEY GOT SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT DOSES OF RADIATION. THEIR DOSES ARE KNOWN, AND THEIR HEALTH HAS BEEN STUDIED EVER SINCE. AND EVEN IN THAT LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY HEAVILY IRRADIATED, 40 OR 50 PEOPLE HAVE DIED SO FAR AND A FEW THOUSAND MAY HAVE SHORTENED LIFE-SPANS DUE TO CANCER IN FUTURE DECADES. AND THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN ANY CHILDREN BORN DEFORMED FROM CHERNOBYL, ACCORDING TO THE BEST AUTHORITATIVE SCIENCE WE'VE GOT FROM THE UNITED NATIONS. SO, PEOPLE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY BEEN FED AN URBAN MYTH, REALLY, ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS OF CHERNOBYL ACTUALLY WERE. >> I MEAN, I'VE GOT BOOKS FULL OF IT -- A MILLION PEOPLE DYING RIGHT NOW OR HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF CHERNOBYL. AND IT'S ONLY 25 YEARS AGO. HOW MANY MILLIONS MORE WILL CHERNOBYL KILL? 40% OF THE EUROPEAN LANDMASS IS RADIOACTIVE, WILL BE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. >> IN ORDER TO BELIEVE THAT MORE THAN 56 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AT CHERNOBYL OR MORE THAN THE MAYBE 4,000 WHO COULD EVENTUALLY DIE OF CANCER -- IN ORDER TO BELIEVE THAT A MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY CHERNOBYL, WHICH IS WHAT GREENPEACE AND HELEN CALDICOTT, A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE CLAIM, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THERE WAS A COVER-UP OF JUST MASSIVE PROPORTIONS BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, BY THE UNITED NATIONS, BY LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THE WORLD'S TOP PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. IT'S SO ABSURD OF AN IDEA, AND IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING GLOBAL WARMING DENIERS THINK. >> HELEN, WHAT... >> I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT PRIVY TO THEIR MOTIVATIONS. WELL, THEY SHOULD LOOK AT THE LITERATURE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STUDY, ALMOST, THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE. THIS IS THE BIGGEST COVER-UP IN THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE. >> HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN... >> MANY OF THE -- THE TACTICS AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AGAINST NUCLEAR POWER ARE EXACTLY THE SAME TACTICS AND ARGUMENTS THAT ARE USED BY CLIMATE SKEPTICS... >> THE UNITED NATIONS -- THAT'S WHERE ALL THIS STARTED. IT WAS THE IPCC IN THE UNITED NATIONS SAID THAT THE WORLD'S GONNA COME TO AN END BECAUSE OF THE EMISSIONS OF CO2. >> ...SO, THE CHERRY-PICKING OF SCIENTIFIC DATA, THE NURTURING OF -- OF -- OF SCIENTISTS WHO HAPPEN TO BELIEVE YOUR IDEOLOGICAL POSITION, AND THE PRODUCTION OF REPORTS WHICH ARE -- WHICH APPARENTLY ARE AUTHORITATIVE AND SCIENTIFIC, BUT ACTUALLY ARE JUST IDEOLOGICAL PROPAGANDA, BASICALLY. >> 41% OF THE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT GLOBAL WARMING CLAIMS ARE EXAGGERATED. >> CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS ARE IDIOTS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM. THEY -- THEY -- THEY ARE DENYING SCIENCE. WE'RE GOING BACK INTO THE DARK AGES. HOW DARE -- HOW DARE THEY DENY SCIENCE! NOT TO UNDERSTAND SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN THIS DAY AND AGE IS MORE THAN IRRESPONSIBLE. I CAN'T. >> YOU KNOW, WE THINK OF JAPAN, WE THINK OF HIROSHIMA, THOSE PICTURES -- HORRIBLE AFTER THE EVENT THAT HAPPENED... >> NO RADIATION IS SAFE, BUT, GENERALLY SPEAKING, AMERICANS DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT -- >> WELL, WE HAVE THIS MAP HERE, AND WE'RE SHOWING, OBVIOUSLY, THE PATH, SOME 5,000 MILES, FIRST TO THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS -- THIS IS WHERE THEY EXPECT THIS TO GO. >> YOU CAN'T REASSURE PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE SO TERRIFIED THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT BACKGROUND CONTEXT, THAT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT RADIATION IS AND WHAT IT MEANS, THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT'S SAFE AND RISK THEY WANT TO BEAR. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL PROBLEMS OF FUKUSHIMA. THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE EXPERTS TO ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE WHAT IS SAFE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. [ BEEPING ] >> [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] [ CONVERSATIONS IN JAPANESE ] >> IF YOU WERE EXPOSED TO THE FALLOUT FROM FUKUSHIMA AND ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, THE U.N., GENERALLY, THE INCREASED RISK OF GETTING CANCER IS ESTIMATED TO BE SO INFINITESIMALLY SMALL, GIVEN THE LARGE POPULATION, THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS IMPACT, EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY. [ BEEPING ] I JUST WON THE BET. THIS -- THIS PARTICULAR WEED HERE IS MORE RADIOACTIVE THAN GUARAPARI BEACH IN BRAZIL. SO, WE'VE GOT -- WHAT DID WE GET -- 44? >> NOW WE'VE SEEN WHAT THE WORST IS THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH A 1960s-ERA WESTERN-DESIGNED REACTOR, WHICH DOES HAVE A CONTAINMENT STRUCTURE, WHICH CHERNOBYL DIDN'T. BUT THIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING YOU CAN BRUSH AWAY. THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TO A REACTOR. [ BIRDS CALLING ] [ MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS ] >> BACK IN THE '80s, IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE, SOMETHING BETTER THAN PRESENT DAY, ABOUT SAFETY. AND IT WASN'T ONLY IN SAFETY. IT WAS IN MATTERS OF WASTE, AS WELL, AND IN PROLIFERATION MATTERS, AND OVER ALL OF THOSE THINGS, THE MATTER OF ECONOMICS. YOU CAN'T MAKE THE PLANT IMPOSSIBLY EXPENSIVE BY MAKING IT TOO COMPLICATED. >> JUST GO AHEAD AND GO UP TO THE MAIN PARKING LOT THERE, THEN. >> ALL RIGHT. THANKS VERY MUCH. SO, IN 1980, I WAS GIVEN THE JOB OF DIRECTING THE ENTIRE PROGRAM OF ADVANCED REACTOR DEVELOPMENT AT ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY. OUR GOAL WAS TO DESIGN A NEW TYPE OF REACTOR WHERE THE VERY PHYSICS OF IT WOULD BE SUCH THAT IT COULD WITHSTAND ALMOST ANY TYPE OF ACCIDENT THAT NUCLEAR PLANTS CAN BE SUBJECT TO. IT WAS CALLED THE IFR, THE INTEGRAL FAST REACTOR. THE BUDGET WAS ABOUT $100 MILLION A YEAR. 1,500 PEOPLE -- SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, SUPPORTING STAFF. THIS WAS A VERY BIG DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TEST IT. CALCULATIONS DON'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE BIG FACILITIES THAT SAY, "IF WE HAVE AN ACCIDENT OF THIS KIND, WHAT WILL HAPPEN?" >> WE WILL NOW START TO SET UP FOR THE TEST. >> WE DID TWO EXPERIMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE SOME UNIQUE SAFETY FEATURES THAT THAT REACTOR HAS THAT OTHERS DON'T HAVE AND INVITED PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME AND WITNESS IT. >> T-MINUS TWO MINUTES. "STATION BLACKOUT" IS A TERM THAT'S USED BY NRC, THE SAFETY FOLKS, TO DESCRIBE THE SITUATION WHERE ONE LOSES ALL BULK A.C. POWER. YOU ASSUME THAT YOU LOSE OFF-SITE POWER. YOU ASSUME THAT YOU'RE GETTING NO A.C. POWER FROM YOUR OWN TURBOGENERATOR. YOU ASSUME THAT YOUR FIRST DIESEL STARTED UP AND IT FAILED TO START UP, THE SECOND ONE STARTED TO START UP, AND IT ALSO FAILED, SO YOU END UP DEAD IN THE WATER WITH NO A.C. POWER. >> THIS EXPERIMENT WAS ALMOST A DIRECT PARALLEL TO WHAT HAPPENED AT FUKUSHIMA. IT WAS EERILY SIMILAR. >> MARK. >> WE RAN THE REACTOR AT FULL POWER... [ ALARM BLARING ] ...DISABLED THE SHUT-DOWN SYSTEM SO THE OPERATORS HAD NO ABILITY TO SHUT THE REACTOR DOWN... AND WE SHUT OFF THE COOLING SYSTEM -- DIDN'T EXTRACT THE HEAT. SO WE JUST LET THINGS GET HOTTER. IN MOST REACTORS, YOU CAN'T DO IT. NO REACTOR I KNOW OF WOULD SURVIVE THAT ACCIDENT. YOU'D -- YOU'D HAVE A MELTDOWN. >> THE INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE WERE WATCHING THE TEMPERATURE GOING UP LIKE THAT, STRAIGHT UP. THEY TURNED AROUND, LIKE SO, TO SEE IF I WAS OR IF THE ARGONNE GUYS WERE RUNNING. [ LAUGHS ] AND BY THE TIME THEY LOOKED UP AGAIN, THE -- THE TRACE HAD TURNED LIKE SO AND IT WAS ON ITS WAY DOWN AND THE -- THE REACTOR JUST QUIETLY SHUT ITSELF DOWN. NO ACTION REQUIRED OF THE OPERATORS, NO ACTION REQUIRED OF THE SAFETY SYSTEMS -- NOTHING. YOU COULD JUST STAND BACK LIKE THIS, WATCH THE DIALS IF YOU WISHED, AND THE REACTOR SHUT ITSELF DOWN. >> 30 SECONDS. >> 30 SECONDS TILL TEST TIME. >> WELL, IN THE AFTERNOON, WE STARTED THE REACTOR UP AGAIN AND CARRIED OUT THE CONDITIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCIDENT AT THREE MILE ISLAND. >> 5...4...3... >> WE SHUT OFF THE PUMPS. >> ...2...1. >> JUST SHUT OFF THE PUMPS. [ ALARM BLARING ] ALL MAJOR REACTOR ACCIDENTS HAPPEN BECAUSE OF ONE THING -- INADEQUATE COOLING. THE IFR-TYPE REACTOR, WHICH EBR-II WAS A PROTOTYPE FOR, IF YOU CUT IT OFF FROM THE STEAM SYSTEM SO IT CANNOT REJECT ITS HEAT, IT WILL JUST SHUT ITSELF DOWN. >> SO IT CAN'T MELT DOWN? >> NO, IT CAN'T MELT DOWN. WE'RE NOW IN THE FACILITY THAT COMPLETES THE CIRCLE, IF YOU LIKE, OF THE INTEGRAL FAST REACTOR. WE'VE COME OUT OF THE REACTOR BUILDING. WE'RE NOW IN THE FUEL CYCLE PART. >> THIS IS TRAVIS AT WINDOW THREE. >> THE INTEGRAL PART OF IT WAS THAT EVERY PART OF A COMPLETE NUCLEAR REACTOR SYSTEM, NOT THE REACTOR ITSELF, BUT, ALSO, THE FACILITIES FOR TREATING THE SPENT FUEL, FOR TREATING THE WASTE, WOULD ALL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SAME SYSTEM. >> AND JUST BRING IT OVER TO... >> WHAT THIS ENABLES YOU TO DO IS YOU CAN TAKE THE SPENT FUEL, CHOP IT UP, AND BACK IT GOES INTO THE REACTOR AGAIN. YOU CAN RECYCLE THE FUEL AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THE END OF PLANT LIFE. >> READY TO RECEIVE THE FUEL ASSEMBLY. [ BEEPS ] >> THE OTHER THING I -- THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID ABOUT ALL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS THAT THIS IS NOT...A DREAM. THIS IS NOT SOMEBODY'S CALCULATIONS ON A PIECE OF PAPER. THIS IS REAL. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS. >> NOW, LET ME FRAME THIS DEBATE, IF I MAY, BY READING A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SENT TO ME YESTERDAY. "THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER SUPPORTING OUR DECISION TO TERMINATE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S ADVANCED LIQUID METAL REACTOR PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE INTEGRAL FAST REACTOR. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SUPPORT THE IFR AND WILL OPPOSE ANY EFFORTS TO CONTINUE THE FUNDING FOR THIS REACTOR PROJECT." >> DEMOCRATS HAVE GOTTEN THEMSELVES ON THE WRONG SIDE, IN MY OPINION, IN THIS ISSUE, BEING OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR POWER FOR, I THINK, NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN THAT IT'S VERY HIGH ON THE LIST OF WHAT REPUBLICANS LIKE. >> WE KNOW THAT NUCLEAR ENERGY IS CLEAN. WE KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T POLLUTE THE AIR. WE KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T DAMAGE THE OZONE. WE KNOW THAT IT IS A TREMENDOUS PRODUCER OF ENERGY IN A CLEAN SENSE. AND OUR ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT WE CANNOT COME TO POLITICAL TERMS ON HOW TO HANDLE THE WASTE STREAM. >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT'S GONNA COST IF WE GO THAT FAR AND CONTINUE OUR OBSESSION WITH NUCLEAR POWER. >> IFR WASTE STREAMS LOSE THEIR RADIOACTIVITY TO BACKGROUND LEVEL IN ABOUT 800 YEARS, LIGHT WATER REACTOR IN NEARLY 10,000. >> I SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES SOME OF THE PUBLIC OPINION ON THIS. THE WASHINGTON POST -- "THE WRONG REACTOR." THE OREGONIAN -- "GIVE UP NUCLEAR BREEDER DREAM." THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONIC -- "SAYING NO TO NUCLEAR PORK." >> THE IFR PROGRAM WAS SHUT DOWN, AND THE PROJECT WENT DOWN THE -- THE -- THE BLACK HOLE OF GOVERNMENT POLITICS. [ VEHICLE APPROACHING ] [ VEHICLE DEPARTING ] >> IT WAS BY CHANCE THAT, IN ABOUT THE YEAR 2000, I THINK, I WOUND UP IN THE DESERT ON A VISIT TO YUCCA MOUNTAIN, AMERICA'S PLANNED NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY 100 MILES NORTH OF LAS VEGAS... A HOLE IN THE GROUND WHERE 10 PLUS BILLION DOLLARS WERE SPENT ON VASTLY EXPENSIVE EXPERIMENTS TRYING TO PROVE THAT THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY "SAFE" -- QUOTE -- FOR THE NEXT 10,000 YEARS. AND SO, IT JUST FELT LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE, PEOPLE. THIS IS -- THIS IS NUTS." AMONG OTHER THINGS, HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT" -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE PROFESSIONAL FUTURISTS, MANY OF US WHO WERE ON THIS TRIP -- "WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS WORLD 10,000 YEARS FROM NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT?" [ CHUCKLES ] SCIENCE FICTION [LAUGHS] IS WHAT WE WERE PLAYING OUT AT VAST EXPENSE AT YUCCA MOUNTAIN. THE KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS THEY WERE DOING IN THAT MOUNTAIN -- IT'S NOT A MOUNTAIN. IT'S JUST A RIDGE -- CERTAINLY DIDN'T PERSUADE ANYBODY. FOR POLITICAL REASONS, YUCCA MOUNTAIN WAS NOT OPENED AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE OPENED. THEN, I STARTED TO LOOK AT, "WELL, WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE AMOUNT OF HAZARD THAT COMES FROM NUCLEAR WASTE?" AND THE FIRST THING I FOUND OUT IS WHAT PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY DOING WITH THE NUCLEAR WASTE, WHICH IS BEING GENERATED ALL THIS TIME BY EVERY NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, TURNS OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD. THEY JUST PUT IT IN THIS PRETTY SIMPLE BUT VERY WORKABLE DRY-CASK STORAGE, AND THEY PARK IT OUT BACK OF THE PARKING LOT. AND YOU CAN GO THERE AND SEE IT. THERE'S THE NATION'S NUCLEAR WASTE. IS IT CAUSING ANY PROBLEMS? NO. [ BEEPING ] THE OTHER REALIZATION FOR ME -- AND IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THROUGH -- IS THAT BY NOT PUTTING IT IN THE GROUND, YOU'VE GOT THE OPTION TO USE IT AS FUEL IN FOURTH-GENERATION REACTORS. WOW. WE CAN TAKE THIS WASTE FROM THE NUCLEAR PLANT AND RECYCLE IT INTO FUEL, EITHER BY REPROCESSING OR BY HAVING A NEW KIND OF REACTOR THAT USES THIS FUEL. [ Chuckling ] THAT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE A RENEWABLE RESOURCE. >> PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR WASTE, THE ACCUMULATION OF NUCLEAR WASTE, AND I DID, TOO. I THINK IT'S AROUND 70,000 TONS HAVE ACCUMULATED OF USED FUEL IN THE UNITED STATES. I THOUGHT THE QUANTITY WAS STAGGERING. IN FACT, ALL THE SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL FROM COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES COULD FIT IN A SINGLE FOOTBALL FIELD IF YOU STACKED THE FUEL RODS TO A HEIGHT OF ABOUT 3 METERS -- THAT'S IT. BUT OF THAT, ONLY A VERY SMALL FRACTION, MAINLY PLUTONIUM, IS LONG-LIVED. BY LONG-LIVED, I MEAN WOULD STILL BE HOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS FROM NOW, STILL BE HIGHLY RADIOACTIVE. >> VOLUMETRICALLY, NUCLEAR PRODUCES TINY AMOUNTS OF WASTE. THE ENTIRE WASTE PRODUCTION FROM FRANCE'S 50 NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS, WHICH PRODUCE 80% OF THE COUNTRY'S ELECTRICITY, ARE UNDER THE FLOOR IN ONE ROOM. COMPARE THAT WITH THE BILLIONS OF TONS OF WASTE PRODUCED BY COAL-FIRED POWER STATIONS. IT COMPLETELY BLOWS AWAY MOST OF THE ANTINUCLEAR ARGUMENTS. SO, IT'S -- IT'S NOT -- NUCLEAR WASTE IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHICH, AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. [ CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYS ] >> ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING STORIES ANYWHERE IS THE STORY OF FRANCE. HERE'S A COUNTRY IN THE EARLY '70s THAT IS BURNING OIL FOR ELECTRICITY. IT DOESN'T HAVE COAL RESERVES. IT DOESN'T WANT TO BE DEPENDENT ON GAS COMING FROM NORTHERN EUROPE AND RUSSIA. BUT WHEN THE OIL SHOCKS HAPPENED AND THE PRICES WENT UP DRAMATICALLY, THE FRENCH REALIZED THEY NEEDED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SOURCE OF ENERGY. >> THEY SAID, "THIS IS SERIOUS, AND IT HAS TO DO WITH NATIONAL SECURITY." SO THEY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAD THE BEST NUCLEAR ENGINEERS AND A STANDARD DESIGN FOR THE REACTORS AND JUST ROLL IT OUT. >> WHAT'S SO SIGNIFICANT ABOUT WHAT THE FRENCH DID IS THAT THEY DID IT SO QUICKLY, AND THEY SCALED UP ALMOST EXACTLY AT THE PACE THAT WE NEED TO SCALE UP NUCLEAR POWER GLOBALLY. >> THEY NOW HAVE 80% OF THEIR ELECTRICITY COMING FROM NUCLEAR. THEIR TRAINS ARE ELECTRIC-POWERED. THEY HAVE CLEAN AIR. THEY HAVE THE CHEAPEST ENERGY IN EUROPE. THEY'RE SELLING IT TO EVERYBODY ELSE. AND THEY ARE GREENER THAN GREEN DENMARK, GREENER THAN GREEN GERMANY. >> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT FRENCH PER CAPITA CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS WERE, WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK. THE ANSWER IS THEY'RE ABOUT 5 TONS PER PERSON, PER YEAR. GERMANY'S ABOUT 10 TONS PER YEAR. SO, GERMANY HAS MUCH, MUCH HIGHER PER-PERSON EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE THAN NEIGHBORING FRANCE BECAUSE FRANCE IS NUCLEAR AND GERMANY IS TRYING TO GET OUT OF NUCLEAR. >> WHEN WE LOOK AT NUCLEAR, WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE MAKING A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. NOW, IT'S A BIG UP-FRONT CAPITAL COST, BUT THESE ARE PLANTS THAT ARE GONNA LAST 60, 80, MAYBE EVEN 100 YEARS. AND MUCH OF THE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEING BUILT WILL LAST FAR LONGER THAN THAT. AND WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, THERE'S JUST REALLY NO QUESTION. IT'S A MUCH MORE ECONOMICAL ALTERNATIVE TO VERY EXPENSIVE SOLAR PANELS OR VERY EXPENSIVE WIND TURBINES THAT REQUIRE BACKUP POWER. >> THE CURRENT GENERATION OF REACTORS WE'RE BUILDING NOW ARE THIRD-GENERATION REACTORS. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MUCH SAFER. BUT FOURTH-GENERATION REACTORS, LIKE THE INTEGRAL FAST REACTORS, CAN USE THE WASTE FROM THE FIRST THREE GENERATIONS AS FUEL. THE GREAT PHILANTHROPIST BILL GATES HAS PUT MONEY AND TIME INTO A TRAVELING WAVE REACTOR THAT YOU BASICALLY STICK IN THE GROUND, AND IT GOES THROUGH ITS BODY OF FUEL OVER A PERIOD OF 60 YEARS. YOU DON'T NEED TO REFUEL IT. THERE'S A THORIUM REACTOR THE SAME GROUP IS WORKING ON. OTHER FOURTH-GENERATION COMING ALONG ARE THE SMALL MODULAR REACTORS. THEY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE KIND OF LOCAL POWER SOURCE THAT ENVIRONMENTALISTS HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE. SO, THERE'S A RENAISSANCE IN REACTOR DESIGN THAT THOSE ARE JUST THE FIRST GLIMPSES OF. [ ELECTRICITY POWERING UP ] >> FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO, PERHAPS, ACCEPT MOST OF THESE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF NUCLEAR POWER, THE ULTIMATE ARGUMENT IS, "BUT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO THE KIND OF KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN USE TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS." AND THAT'S QUITE TRUE. IT IS. THERE ARE, BY THE CIA's ESTIMATE, ABOUT 37 COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TODAY THAT, IF THEY WANTED TO, COULD DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THEY HAVE THE TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. HOW MANY COUNTRIES ACTUALLY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS? NINE. WHICH, I THINK, BEGINS TO POINT OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN THE CONCERN -- WE WON'T GET RID OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY FORGETTING HOW TO MAKE THEM. WE WILL GET RID OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY DECIDING WE DON'T WANT THEM AROUND ANYMORE. >> IT TURNS OUT THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN BUYING UP NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM THE RUSSIANS FOR OVER 10 YEARS NOW -- 16,000 NUCLEAR WARHEADS, AND WE'RE RECYCLING ALL OF THESE NUCLEAR WARHEADS INTO ENERGY, ELECTRICITY, AND NUCLEAR POWER. AND SO NUCLEAR POWER IS DOING MORE TO DE-NUCLEAR-WEAPONIZE THE WORLD THAN ANY OTHER THING THAT WE DO. POETICALLY, IT'S RATHER BEAUTIFUL. THE VERY THINGS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO BLOW UP OUR CITIES ARE NOW LIGHTING UP OUR CITIES. AND AMAZINGLY, 10% OF AMERICAN ELECTRICITY, HALF OF OUR NUCLEAR POWER, COMES FROM REPROCESSED RUSSIAN WARHEADS. WELL, IDEALLY, EVERY SINGLE NUCLEAR WEAPON IN THE WORLD EVENTUALLY CAN GET TURNED INTO ELECTRICITY. >> I BELIEVE THAT, WHILE MUCH OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT THAT CAME OF AGE IN THE '60s WILL NEVER CHANGE, I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE NEXT GENERATION WILL. THEY'RE GONNA UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN AN ENERGY-HUNGRY WORLD, AND THEY'RE GONNA PUT NUCLEAR IN ITS PROPER CONTEXT. WE CAN HAVE A WORLD OF 7 BILLION, 8 BILLION, 9 BILLION, EVEN 10 BILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING HIGH-ENERGY, RESOURCE-INTENSIVE, MODERN LIVES WITHOUT KILLING THE CLIMATE... AND THAT'S EXCITING. I HAVE -- I HAVE A SENSE THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING REALLY BEAUTIFUL. [ ALL SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] YOU ACTUALLY DO FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A MOVEMENT.
