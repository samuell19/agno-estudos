(BELT WHIRRING) (SPEAKER BEEPING) WOMAN: AOP, red stamp reports overseeing officer for housing assignments. LEE: All I can do in here is count. The weekly ODs, the daily assaults, the 14 murders. The thought of your face is my only distraction, that and the constant hustle it takes to write you. Every cent of every stamp is hard-won and every minute I don't hear from you feels like another 10 year sentence. Where are you? I'm counting on you. I can't stop counting. While you let me rot in here, think about that. I saved you, now it's your turn, you fuckin' owe me. Alright, let's see what y'all got. Bullets. You done, take a walk. What, you got a problem with my money? Fool, what money? I won every stamp you got, maybe I should write your girl. Punches no longer accepted, huh? Man, you in some darkness. But if you wanna bet that pretty face, go right ahead. Let's see how good your bluff is, now (LAUGHING).

Not running from the scene of a murder? Who been murdered? Dumb motherfucker. Everyone hold up. What's your name, officer? Tera Sharpe. Right, you're Gerald's daughter. Yes, Captain. Well Tera, the coroner's calling this one a suicide. Captain, check his boots, there's blood. You don't have to prove anything to me. You're Gerald's kid, I'm sure you got skills but I got experience, which tells me that if you collar this fool and collect all your evidence and so on and so on, it's not gonna lead to a conviction. It's just gonna get fucked up. So what happens to the victim? The victim was serving three consecutive life sentences, he was gonna die in here anyway. And this chump gets to go free? Oh, he'll get punished, just not by us. He's part of a circle of death now. Whatever beef he had that made him kill, it's gonna come back to him somehow. Then he's gonna end up losing. Just let nature take it's course, it's more efficient. We cool? Yeah. False alarm, release him. Deal me in, few minutes left. Every time you lose, my fist lose mercy, motherfucker. Teach you how to punch. Well let's up it up, then. (SOMBER MUSIC) I already got him, Alexa. Yeah, he's clean. - I got six days. - That's right, baby.

(RECEIVER BANGING) I know she's thinking about me just the way I'm thinking about her, I just don't know how to find her. Seems she don't wanna hear from ya. I love her. When you love something, you chase it. What if you chasin' something that ain't even there? See, we on the inside get stuck in time thinkin' that the rest of the world is on pause but it ain't, we paused. Them on the outside are on play. This here is your life now. I'm telling you to find peace in what you got, not what's missing. Preach it. How'd I know I'd find you out here? You wander away from my poppy fields and now look at ya, man without a country. I hear you got 12 days clean, ups. Thanks. Yo, hold up. (CONTINENTAL GROWLING) No disrespect. This here would be Continental. (LAUGHING) What they call you? Lee. Best orderly in the joint, got me off that poison you slang. A miracle worker, huh? - Stealin' my best customer. - Ease up. My man is stingin', his girl just left him. Came to Jules for some schoolin'. Told me to give up. - That what you heard? - Give, won't be seein' that word in my memoirs. There's too much to take. Much love for ya, Jules. Mm mm, don't even. He ain't the one to listen to. Seems like a man who gets things done. Sure, got his ducks in a row. Ducks? Yeah, ducks. Like quack quack motherfuckin' ducks. Ducks are COs that get sucker til they under a con's thumb. That's how he gets the heroin, then. One foot inside with us, one in the outside world. Whatever you're thinkin', stay away from that man. You stay away from this shit. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I don't wanna spend a lot of time on specifics because it's the bigger picture I want you to worry about. Curt Martin was arrested today for narcotics trafficking. We all know it was his undue familiarity with the inmates that led to such a charge, he'll be punished accordingly. Good man, Captain. Okay, I don't know about y'all, but I'm ready to wake up from that nightmare. Let's face some facts, we have 100 officers for 1,000 prisoners. Now, as CO Martin showed us all, you can easily get lost if you get too close and lose perspective. This place is a fuckin' jungle. (INMATES CLAMORING) I come bearing gifts. They ain't Gucci, but good lookin' out. Alright, I got shit to attend to. Thought about what you said to me. I'm gonna go after her. God bless. I want your help. With what? LEE: Gettin' out of here. What you know about me? Actually, I don't know anything. Yet here you are asking me to commit a felony. Man, I just thought we could - work this out. - Bounce. And quit peddling me shit like some Nigerian prince with a Yahoo account. If you ever step to me again like that, I'm gonna come down to that infirmary, grab a syringe and stick your carotid with it, dead center. Boom, air bubble fuckin' embolism. This is my Zen garden. Not a single piece of paper. Know how I've got 15 years on the job? By not letting a soul fuck with it. Your father taught me that, he was a mentor of mine. He taught me something crucial to my success here, there are lines drawn in sand and lines drawn in concrete and to have a career here, you need to know the difference. What do you know about Curt Martin? Beyond what you said at roll call, nothing really. Lot of rumors. I had him on midnight crew. Post with a lot of autonomy, thought he could handle it and it buried him. I trust you won't have that problem when you take it over. Thank you, Captain. Congratulations, run it clean and it'll prove an excellent springboard for advancement. - Make your daddy proud. - Yes, ma'am. Remember about the Zen garden. Don't worry, I won't fuck it up.

You haven't heard what I want yet. Fuck. Speak it. Same thing I wanted last time, midnight train outta here. What am I, Harriet Tubman? What I need from your man is that it gets... No. Felix is still a duckling. He ain't got the fat or the feathers for something like that. Even if he did, you think he'd risk his job, his healthcare, his motherfuckin' pension for you?

You need to find some feathers to ruffle. I got some. Tera Sharpe? Rumor is you know her from somewhere else. She works midnight crew now. Midnight crew. How the hell am I gonna get on midnight crew? You did good tonight, I got you. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CAT MEOWING) Chill, lady. I think that overdose fucked her up, she's so needy now. Anyways, congratulations. Look at this shit. I think she's done. So why the congratulations? You're gettin' transferred to midnight crew. Time to get your dick wet. Any advice? The only difference between downin' a duck and makin' a friend is what you're lookin' to get in the end. I'm lookin' to get out, but don't I need some kind of escape plan? (LAUGHING) You duck shorty right, and she'll be the one comin' to you with a plan. Midnight crew will give you room to operate. You'll have her and this whole joint to yourself. Get her believin' you deserve to be free. Check out a CO handbook, every rule you can get her to break is leverage in case she don't take to you. (CAT MEOWING) Meow this, meow that, it's gettin' on my fuckin' nerves. I think it's best you take her. Good luck, yo. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Heartlock High, that's how I know you. Hands in pockets.

Just do your thing. You, garbage detail. Tera Sharpe, right? No first names. The girl that always wore different colored ribbons in her hair. I am not that girl, I am not a girl, I am your CO and you're an inmate so stop fucking talking to me like you know me. Alright. Just never thought I'd see you in here. Funny, 'cause I always knew you'd end up in here. Hey, move. So you do remember me. Shit. (TERA LAUGHING) Hey princess, don't go past the dumpsters, they'll shoot your ass. Fuck. Hey, was that good for you? Laughing at me? Get your fucking hands up against that wall. Tera. - What did you call me? - CO. How long do I have to stay here? Til I say so. (KEYS JANGLING) Goodnight. (SOMBER MUSIC) I'm sorry about last night, didn't mean to get you riled up. Hey, why don't you like me? Did I do something to you back in the day? Turned your back on society. (LAUGHING) Come on, that's like straight outta the manual. But your attitude, that's personal. - Oh really? - Mm hm. Please, enlighten me. I don't know, I'm thinkin' maybe it's 'cause I knew you on the outside, you know I've seen you smile. Oh really? You used to have a nice smile, what happened? Break's over. (DOOR SLAMMING) - You know how snakes hunt? - No. They taste chemicals in the air, detecting every little change, it's very precise. Nothin' gets by them. Are we gonna talk business or what? The shade best be clean. No doubt. I chose the wrong duck. I can't get through to her, her walls are up. You gotta find what's in a person's soul before you can possess 'em. She won't talk to me. Maybe you just ain't really listening. He has early onset Alzheimer's, he's in no position to make decisions like that. All I'm asking is that you call me first, Tom. I had to climb through a window and he nearly shot me. I know he's your best friend, but he's my father god dammit. I spent my life stuck in this town taking care of him. Show me some respect, that's all I'm asking, thank you. You and her ain't so different, you're both lookin' to escape something. Yeah, I can work with that. ("I PUT A SPELL ON YOU") (CAN CLANGING) (LEE GRUNTING) Fuck! Shit. What happened? Cut it on a piece of metal. Thanks for this. Shit, this is deeper than I thought. You might need stitches. No, I'll be fine. Will you just bandage it? Come on, I don't wanna go to the infirmary. Hold this, I need to tie it with something. Your. Oh yeah. You're pretty good at this. Make a good nurse. I'd never do that job. Why not? Hate hospitals. Last time I was in one was at the San Onofre Bluffs on the Pacific coast. For a cut like this, actually, I stepped on a piece of broken sea glass. Must be nice. Yeah. Was an adventure. (TERA LAUGHING) What? We're just different, that's all. How? You're one of those guys, y'know? Who just does whatever he wants like everything'll work out. Is that why you're giving me such a hard time? You think? That you would turn your back on everything and everyone if it cramped your style? Yeah, pretty much. (INMATE BANGING) CO, you gotta come see this. Shit. - What's going on? - Fuck. Red pin, freezer two, red pin. - (ALARM BLARING) - Fucked up, man. See, what'd I tell you? Circle of death. Okay, off the wall. Let this be a lesson to all of y'all, remember who are and where you belong. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Alright, move out. - How 'bout this for leverage? - What you goin' for with that? Article two, section five, paragraph six. Exactly. Article of personal value exchanged between staff member and inmate. Okay, you got yourself a prop. You got a story to go with that? Yeah, I cut my own fucking hand to get her to touch me, she ended up giving it to me as a tourniquet. Nah, circumstance ain't story. Peep this, me and Tera were in the nasty. She ripped that ribbon from her hair, wrapped my hands up in it and took my dick in her mouth and said (GARGLING). - Lie about it? - Make it truth, make it emotional, make her yours. - Gabos! - Gabos, what? Giving ain't based on sympathy. Yeah. (SOMBER MUSIC) SWEET: Nigga, I'm talkin' 'bout goin' straight. A regular fuckin' job. The hell you talkin' about? Jewelry, start sellin' jewelry. Aw man, I'm away from it. Just me in that bed squeakin'. Oh, you talkin' 'bout wildin' the jewelry stuff, man. That's what I'm sayin'. Get away with all that motherfuckin' jewelry and never get caught, we won't get caught. Think about that one, man. Make sure do somethin' good, though. Aight, Sweet. Do you have my ribbon? What ribbon? The one I used on your cut. Didn't I give it back to you? Pretty sure I did. Pretty sure you didn't. What, you don't trust me? Or don't you remember? Are you normally forgetful? I know you hate hospitals, but maybe you should get that checked out. Come on, I'm not a bad guy. Stop fuckin' with me. Stop assuming the worst about me. (WISTFUL MUSIC) (DISC SLAPPING) MAN: She took you to find this girl that you were staying with, you don't wanna spend more time in prison than you have to, do ya? LEE: No. MAN: If you tell us where she is, we can help you. I already told you, Lily had nothing to do with this. So you been in Heartlock ever since graduation? Nice try. What? We're not friends, I don't talk about my personal life with you. Fine, let's talk about mine then. (WHEELS CLATTERING) Do you remember Lily Thomas? We started dating in high school, both our parents were fucked up so we got the hell outta there. No money, no plan, but we had each other, y'know? Made it all the way to California. You have no idea how beautiful it is to see the whole country whiz by at 120 miles an hour. Man, I got to travel, got to be in love, to be free. Just thinking about that gets me through the day to day here. How do you get through it? Like I always do, I just get through it. Sounds shitty. Happens. What? Shit. (LAUGHING) Must have, seems both you and I ended up in prison. (CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC) So the third con pulls out a bunch of tampons. (LAUGHING) So the second con goes well what the fuck can you do with those? Third con goes well according to the box, I can go swimming or bike riding or roller skating. (ALL LAUGHING) Oh, you're laughing with me now? You and I are both just people sharing the same planet. I've been through a divorce, I know what a good lawyer costs. But I also know that I just hate to see you get burned by the legal system. You got a good referral? I'll do you one better, I'll get you half off. I know this guy, he's handled many of my affairs. I wouldn't say he owes me anything per se, but accommodations could be made if. FELIX: If what? If you handle that package thing I mentioned a while back. Can't you just get another cat? You think it's easy? Lala's retired, she's outta the game so I'm pulling you off the bench. You should be thanking me. For what? Okay, let's not get into who owes who. What matters is you and I is friends, I care about you which is why I'll be there to help you when you need it seeing as you're helping me right now. With those packages, just look for the ones addressed to my Christian name, Kirkland Bosta. But the logs, you know and they screen all the time and it just, it looks sketchy. Look, what about my pension, man? Felix, that's why I have you there. I trust you, you can handle it, hm? You can handle it. Yeah, go on. Hey, come here. Come here. Felix buggin' on me. Felix? Yeah motherfucker, Felix. Seems pretty sucker to me. They always do until they ain't. (ALARM BUZZING) (BELT WHIRRING) (ALARM BUZZING) That last package turned red. - Huh? - You put it in the cleared bin. Did I? Fuckin' machines. I'm tellin' ya, man, this place is going to shit. It's like he knew exactly what I was doing. Freaked me the fuck out, man. I just, I don't wanna end up like Curt Martin, y'know? You know what they do to law enforcement in the joint. Don't be cryin' no rivers about Martin. He brought that shit on himself. How? It's not like either one of us signed up for this. No, the skeletons in your closet did. I didn't have any skeletons til I met you. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey. Sit. Those letters you got back, they were from Lily? Mm hm. After we got back from California, we were squatting, never knew where we were gonna end up next so I opened a P.O. box in case we ever got separated. That's where I sent the letters. You were worried about getting separated. Well yeah, we knocked off half a dozen convenience stores together. You told the police that you were the only one responsible. I looked at your file the other day, saw your confession. Well that's just what you do when you love someone. Suffer for them? I know what that's like. Better to have loved and lost, right? I'm not like you, I'm not a risk taker. Why? I guess I hate to lose, it's just how I was raised. Lily taught me that playing safe was worse than losing, there's no room to win. You two sound dangerous. Yeah. Like Bonnie and Clyde. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LIGHTER FLICKING) Hey, Officer Tera Sharpe, New York State Corrections. I called you about the Thomas file. Hey. There's something I wanna tell you. Oh yeah? I went looking for her. Lily? Something happen to her? No, it's not like that. She's the reason you're in here, Lee. What? She ratted you out. Here. I'm sorry. What the fuck are you talkin' about? You wanted to find out where she is. That's where she is. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I need you to come in tomorrow. I got a fragile package coming that needs your soft hands. - Yeah, but tomorrow's... - Y'know, all I get from you is buts, negativity like that kills relationships. I bet your wife told you that shit in counseling but you probably shut her out, too. Leadership is complicated. Why would she fucking betray me? Why? 'Cause people be people, they do shit. It's like I never even knew her. You know, I was in a similar situation like that once. And look at me now. What happened? I killed her, summer of '91. That why you're in? Amongst other wrongs I've had to right. What I'm tryin' to say is I found anger just about solves everything. But hey, you know, that's just me. Well I ain't like you, I don't kill. And I don't get betrayed. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Stuck here every night, why the fuck am I here? How you holdin' up? Got the clientele, got the employees, we ain't got us in shit but bank. How much money we talkin' a week, though? - Quarter mil. - Straight up? No bullshit, yo. What up, Lee? - Oh, cowboy. - You alright? Yeah, I missed. You alright, what's goin' on man?

I thought love conquers all or some shit. Man, there ain't no one thing that conquers. You talk about love the way a junkie talks about smack. I'm no addict. Man, call it what you like, you're an escape artist. I doubt Lily was blinded. Love needs to be about more than running away from the past. (SOMBER MUSIC) GERALD: Where's my goddamn gun? Dad, stop okay? We've been robbed. I gave it back to Tom, okay? You can't have a gun anymore, dad, you're too sick. What? What, I don't know that? I know that.

(CONTINENTAL SCREAMING) Now who's the bitch. (CAMERA SNAPPING) Inmate at Heartlock Correctional Facility is said to be released from solitary confinement after these images of his severely beaten face. Wounds he said he sustained during an unprovoked attack by prison staff surfaced earlier today. The inmate, known by his street name Continental, indicated that he was able to steal a cellphone while being attacked, then using his camera, documented his injuries while uploading the selfies to several social media sites, with captions pleading for his life. Photographs picked up the attention of the ACLU, prompting a thunderstorm meeting between ACLU lawyers and the state's attorney. Although it's rare for the state's attorney to get involved in this sort of matter, it's not unprecedented, especially given that this is the second incident this year involving alleged corruption at Heartlock. The first was the arrest of Officer Curtis Martin, who was charged with drug trafficking. All this leads many to question of what the crew is allowing full scale corruption of the five under her command. So how the fuck did I end up in the hole? How the fuck did my shit get took from the mail? I don't know. - Don't play dumb. - I'm not. So you think I should kill Felix? He works the mail room, he was there that night. So was your girly, you think I should kill her? No. You protectin' her? Oh, you don't have to answer that. But you do need to answer me. So you use your leverage, 'cause she don't belong to you anymore. Now bring that bitch to me. Where should I go? Mail room, you get on the midnight crew tomorrow. Alright, no problem. Oh, there is gonna be a fuckin' problem, just ask Felix. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (LIGHTER FLICKING) Know anything about Buddhism? No. Didn't think so. The Buddhists believe in karma, a cycle of cause and effect connectin' us all. What you do influences me, what I do influences the next guy and so on. You caused some shit by seizing all those drugs. A big timer ended up in the hole, and now he's out. That's gonna come back at ya. You need to watch your back. If you have any vacation time, now's a good time to take it. Let's run away together. Now? Why be stuck in here when I can be free with you? You'd lose your job. Fuck, you'd lose everything. Hold 22. If you don't wanna get out of here or if you don't wanna be with me or if there's anything that you're hiding, now's the time to tell me. How would we even do it? Meet me in the chapel tomorrow night. (SOMBER MUSIC) Karma's a bitch. I've been watchin' like you asked, something's up with her, I can feel it. Good lookin' out, friend. Yeah. (KEYS JANGLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Tera. Sad about our friend here. Heart attack. They sayin' it was some sort of embolism. I told you I don't get betrayed. Word is you tryin' to fly away with my duck. That true? - No. - Cool. So, you still wanna be free? (BOTH STRUGGLING) What the fuck are you doing? (BLOOD SPLATTERING) (CONTINENTAL GASPING) World be crazy. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I love you. MAN: Come in, Sharpe. (ALARM BLARING) (SOMBER MUSIC) (RADIO CHATTER) MAN: Captain, the ACLU is on the phone. They say they're going to the press. The ACLU claims Heartlock inmate Kirkland Bosta has been killed. Bosta last made headlines on Tuesday when he filed a lawsuit against the facility alleging police brutality. Sources say a guard was present at the time of Bosta's death and that the body was found in a restricted area. The ACLU is demanding an investigation. Some guy with a badge is outside, he says he wants to photograph your injuries. Yeah, please. (DISCORDANT MUSIC) MAN: Hi, this is Dennis Mahogany, attorney at law. I've been a longtime friend of law enforcement, so you know, I hear things and well, give me a call, 518. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Yo, where's Tera? Beats me, she's in deep shit. You were right, getting with Continental got me twisted. Glad you startin' to see things straight. I don't know how to straighten out without hurting people. You killed a man and left Tera to take the blame, I'd say people are already hurt. You wanna fix things, god dammit, start with the truth. It's the gruesomeness of it all, and the fact that you were found there alone covered in his blood. Those are the kind of details the media latches onto, putting pressure on the system to act. Now the DA's opening up an investigation and there will inevitably be a grand jury. Your name is likely to surface soon. There's no runnin' from this. Your life, your career, your past, it will all be dug up and scrutinized. I don't need that kind of attention anymore than you do, understand? I put in the paperwork for your paid leave. If you have any dirty laundry, it's time to burn it. (CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC) (ALARM BLARING) Stop! I said stop. Wait. No. (GUN FIRING) (SIRENS WAILING) (PHONE RINGING) (TERA KNOCKING) Still with us. Barely. Right. Your father should be proud, he raised a fighter. Get outta here. Hold up. Say, this look familiar to you? We found it in Lee's pocket. Mean anything to you? No. ("I PUT A SPELL ON YOU") ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ Because you're mine ♪ ♪ You better stop the things that you do ♪ ♪ I ain't lyin' ♪ ♪ Ain't gonna take none of your foolin' around ♪ ♪ I ain't gonna take none of your puttin' me down ♪ ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ Because you're mine ♪ ♪ You better stop the things that you do ♪ ♪ I ain't lyin' ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ I love you so ♪ ♪ I don't care if you don't want me ♪ ♪ I'm yours right now ♪ ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ Because you're mine ♪ ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ I put a spell on you ♪ ♪ And now you're mine ♪ Mm meow.
