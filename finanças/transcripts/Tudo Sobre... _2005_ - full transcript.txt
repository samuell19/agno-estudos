Previously on "The Tudors"... I demand to know whose subjects are you: The pope's, or mine? Here is submission of the clergy, to your majesty's will. - The church is broken. - If I would weep, sir thomas, I would weep tears of blood. His majesty clearly thinks that you are destined for better things. Which is why he has appointed you his special envoy to the court of the emperor. I've received a letter from our friend Cranmer. In Nurnberg, clergy are allowed to marry. And mr. Cranmer has taken full advantage of that fact. - Lady Elizabeth. - What do you want? You know what I want. Are you really going to marry mistress Boleyn? I have it on very good authority that she and Thomas Wyatt were once lovers. - She denies it. - Well, she would, wouldn't she? I said she denies it! What of this girl, the king's whore? Why doesn't someone just get rid of her? If you succeed, you will be the beloved of god, of his holiness, and of the emperor. There are rumours that your grace secretly supports the queen. - So what happened to you? - I grew up. I come to offer my resignation for my post as chancellor. I promise that I will never speak publicly of your majesty's great matter. I will hold you to that promise. We have a duty still to act in the interests of christendom. Whatever the cost. I promise you that the thing I have so longed for will be accomplished here. Now, my love, let me conceive. And we will have a son. His majesty commands that you be gone from this place. Wherever I go, I remain his wife. I beseech your highness not to pursue the path you seem to be taking. Or you will surely follow Ahab, who married the whore Jezebel! The dogs will lick your blood! Synch: jocool, morgan, mezzi, Licisca The Tudors - Season 02 Episode 03 - Pennington! - Ah, the Southwells! How's your master, Boleyn? That's Lord Rochford to you, Pennington. Sir William Pennington to you, Southwell. And how is your master? Master fucking Brandon? Does he still persist in using the most foul and abusive language against my master's daughter, Lady Anne. - who is soon to be queen? - The duke can speak for himself. I'm asking you, Pennington! His grace wants nothing to do with the elevation of the king's whore! Who's a whore? - Let me pass! - Not till you've paid for that. Run! Fetch the duke! Go! Father, I seek sanctuary in this place. Of course, my child. Put up your swords, gentlemen. This is a place of god. Defend yourself, Pennington. Dear god! You dishonour the Boleyn family whom you serve. And you offend god by offering violence here. Stop it. Stop now, for the love of god! Enough is enough! You fool, Richard. You've killed him! Oh, my lord. They've killed him. Murderers! Oh my lord, my lord, I beg you, in the name of our lord. One murder has been committed here already. You scum. - Your grace, we... - Shut up! - You're both dead men. - My lord, listen! I beg you. Those who commit murder in church are damned in the eyes of god. This is your doing, Boleyn! Lady Anne is not to be disturbed. Suddenly everyone is beating a path to Lady Anne's door! Why do you suppose that is, mr. Wyatt? Because everyone prefers a rising sun to a setting sun, mr. Smeaton. Now tell me, what are you writing at the moment? A satire. You find all this funny? Well, it has its funny side, like all serious things. For example and this will make you laugh, Mark. Mr. Cromwell just told me I've been appointed to the privy council. That's ridiculous. Everything in life is ridiculous. And to suppose otherwise is... - It's human vanity. - Mr. Wyatt. My lady. - You know what? - No, I don't I have a furious hankering for apples, such as I've never had before. It started three days ago. Apples? Yes! Apples. The king told me it was a sign I was pregnant, but I said it was nothing of the sort. What was that about? What news from france? None to give your majesty any satisfaction. Although he promised to make representations to the pope on your majesty's behalf. King Francis did no such thing. It doesn't matter. What else should we have expected from the king of France? The fact is, I now have a good reason... a very good reason, not to wait for the pope's decision. The annulment of my marriage must be declared immediately. Well, as your majesty is head of the church now, - you yourself could... - No. The annulment should still be decided and declared by the church proper. That is to say, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As your majesty knows, there remains a vacancy for that position. I think I know exactly who will suit. Mr. Cranmer! Yes. - Your belongings from Germany. - Thank you. If you could just... thank you, sir. At last. Katharina. It's over now. You're here. I'm very relieved to see you, Thomas. I thought I was going to die! It's not the nicest way to travel, even for an illegal wife! It's over now. You're here now. Do you forgive me? So... This is England? This is England. They want to make Cranmer archbishop. I wonder if the pope knows of the reputation Cranmer has here for being devoted heart and soul to the lutheran movement. He was once chaplain to the Boleyns. He ought to be required to take a special oath not to meddle with the divorce. Of course he'll meddle! That's what they want! They don't care about holy curch anymore. They don't even care about the people. The king, in his blindness, fears no one but god. I fear for the queen. They say Anne Boleyn hates her openly and her daughter, too. She's made threats against the child. Those are dangerous words. Think also of the lives of your own children. What is this? The bull "Sublimus Dei", holy father. Remind me. It forbids the enslavement of the native peoples of the new world. Then we sign it very willingly. For the fact is, Campeggio, that the kings of europe have power but no morality. I must act as their conscience. They are my wilful children and I their father, leading them along the paths of righteousness. So help me god. And this? The king of England asks your approval to appoint a new archbishop of Canterbury, after the death of archbishop Warham. And people say he doesn't care! - What is the name of the candidate? - Thomas Cranmer. What do we know of this Cranmer? Virtually nothing. He's an obscure cleric. A nobody. There are strong rumors that he is a secret lutheran. Then we should not approve his appointment. No. Not in my opinion, holiness. And yet... we want to give the english church the opportunity to return to its first allegiance, and our true faith. We want to please the king. We want to make him beholden to us. What better way to please him than to approve the appointment of a nobody? After all, what harm can a nobody inflict upon our holy church? Your grace. We are most pleased to see you confirmed as archbishop. Your majesty, I confess I had some scruples about accepting the office, since I must receive it at the pope's hand. You are not beholden to Rome. Only to god. And me. And now, archbishop, as principle minister of spiritual jurisdiction in our realm, I ask you to determine once and for all, my great matter. Whether or not my first marriage was valid. Majesty, I shall address the question with the greatest urgency, and presently pronounce my verdict. - Mr. Cromwell. - Majesty? Since the departure of Thomas More, England has lacked a chancellor. I am trusting you to fill that office. Majesty. Where is he? Where's Suffolk? We are gathered here together, in the sight of god almighty, to join in holy matrimony, this man and this woman. And will you both answer that you will keep all these coming days rightful, with rightwiseness and discretion, with mercy and truth. So help you god. Master Brereton. It's no use. I failed. And I can no longer bear this place. Then go where your heart tells you. With god's blessing. - My lady... - The Duke of Suffolk. Your grace. My lady... his majesty has ordered me here. He's asked me to tell you... He warns you not to try to return to him... since he is now married to the Lady Anne. From henceforth, you must substain from using the title of queen. You will now be referred to as the princess dowager of Wales. You must also cut your household expenses. In his generosity, the king allows you to keep your property, but will no longer pay your servants' wages, or your household expenses. And what of my daughter? - What of Mary? May I see her? - Madam. Forgive me. You know something, mister Brandon? If I had to choose between extreme happiness and extreme sorrow... I would always choose sorrow. For when you are happy you forget... you forget about spiritual things; you forget about god. But in your sorrow... he is always with you. May lord bless you and keep you, my lady. As long as I live, I will call myself the queen of England. - Deo gracias. - Amen. Your grace, I have some news. I have learned that signor Cromwell is to present another bill to parliament. The act of restraint of appeals. And under its innocuous title does it conceal its most revolutionary intent. What does it say? "This realm of england is an empire, "governed by one supreme head and king, and owing no allegiance except to god." In future, all final appeals on spiritual matters will be heard, not in Rome, but in England, where the king will now enjoy... "plenary, whole and entire power, pre-eminence, "authority, prerogative and jurisdiction." Which means, I take it, that the act prohibits the hearing of the king's nullity suit by the pope. And, by the same token, bars the queen - from appealing to the vatican against any decision made here. - Exactly. No english sovereign has ever been granted such absolute power. - Poor Katherine. - It's worse. - There are rumours that the king has married Anne in secret. - No! And that she is already with child. Your eminences. At the conclusion of this properly constituted ecclesiastical court, I am ready to pronounce the verdict agreed by us all. It is a pity that certain persons refused to come here and testify! But that in itself holds no bearing upon our conclusions. Which are: That the union between king Henry of England and Katherine of Aragon is declared null and void. And therefore, that the king's marriage to Anne Boleyn is declared both valid and lawful, in the eyes of god. Sir. - Elizabeth? - Not that. - Then what? - I came on behalf of my lady, though not with her permission. Thomas, she is in a most wretched way... abandoned and betrayed. It seems so cruel of the king to humiliate her in every way, pretending to marry that Harlot... What? Did you not know? The duke of Suffolk came to tell her that the king has married... Anne? Boleyn? But what can I do about any of that? You are now a privy councillor. And a client of mister Cromwell. I thought you could speak up for my mistress. Mister Cromwell is the least likely man to sympathise with your mistress. You must know that, Elizabeth. But what about you? If you still have feelings for me, you will speak out for her. I'm sorry. As the successor of st. Peter, I do solemnly condemn the separation of the king of England from Katherine of Aragon, and his subsequent secret marriage, which I declare null and void. This matter, of the validity of his majesty's marriage, can only be decided by the curia, which has not yet reached its conclusion. I will give the king until september to take back his former wife... on pain of excommunication, which is separation from holy church, from communion, and from god. Thank you, your excellencies. You may communicate my words to your masters everywhere. Come with me, master Brereton. Holy father, this is the young english gentleman I was telling you about, who brought us the news from the English court. Master William Brereton. My son. We are grateful to you for bringing news of these terrible events and for all you tried to do to prevent them. I tried to rid you of her, but unfortunately, holy father I failed. Who knows, my son? God works in mysterious ways. Cardinal Campeggio tells me you want to stay in Rome now, and not return to England. Is that correct? Yes, holy father. I would rather remain with the flock of the faithful. Recently, master Brereton, I have ordained a new and very special holy order. They are the militantis ecclesiae. the soldiers of christ. These jesuits, as they are called, these soldiers, will go where others fear, where often they will meet great danger, in order to promote the catholic faith and take the word of god to heathens and heretics. I see already your passion for this cause, and I beg you, join the order, join the crusade against heresy, and return to England, even at the risk of martyrdom. - Mister Cromwell. - Majesty? How are the preparations for the coronation? They're going well, majesty. I want the people to love their new queen as I love her. And if I can love her, why shouldn't they? I assure your majesty they will love her, and shall have every reason to do so. Yes, I like it. Madame la marquise. No. Just sister. How are you, sister? How are both of you? We are both very well. Listen. The king and I have visited a famous astrologer, who confirmed what the physicians say, and what I know in my heart: That it's a boy. The king is overjoyed. He keeps wanting to tell people, but I tell him not to. Not yet anyway. Come and look at these. Mr. Holbein has been designing all kinds of things for the coronation procession. They're so beautiful. Mr. Holbein is indeed a genius. Are you scared? Anne? What is it? Oh, it's nothing. It's... what's wrong, husband? I'm going to have to attend on the king and that bitch of his at her coronation. What did Wolsey used to call her? The black crow! Can you not plead some indisposition? I could...even though the king has made me high constable for the day. But if I did, his majesty would remove my head, and then I should be genuinely indisposed. Very well. So keep your head. It's a pretty head, in any case, and I don't want to lose it either. But store up your knowledge and your anger. Don't act impulsively, it's always a mistake. But one day, with others so disposed, use them both, and if you can, bring her down and destroy her. Hear ye, hear ye! Make way for his gracious majesty, King Henry, and the Lady Anne Boleyn, Marquess of Pembroke! Make way, make way! Where are the crowds? Where are the people? - What the hell happened here? - He's dead! Shot! My god! Keep the procession moving. I can't! - What was that? - An accident. Nothing for your majesty to be concerned about. For nothing on earth is going to spoil this day. Veni, creator spiritus mentus tuorum visita. Imple superna gratia quae tu creasti pectora. Tu septiformis munere, digitus paternae dexterae; tu rite promissum patris, sermone ditans guttura. Accende lumen sensibus infundem amorem cordibus in firmans nostri corporis virtute firmans perpeti. Amen. Wait! Give it to me. With this, St Edward's crown, I do solemnly crown you queen of England. And here... are the two sceptres of the sovereign. Honour and grace be to our queen Anne. May you prosper, go forward, and may you bear a new son of the king's blood. That was an assassination attempt. either upon you or upon the queen. - A groom was killed. - Mm-hmm. Thank you, mr. Cromwell. Sweetheart. How was that? Did you like the city? - Was not everything well done? - Yes, it was beautiful. But so few people! And they kept their hats on their heads. And no one shouted. It was more like a funeral than a parade. You have a party to go to. I want you to be happy. I want you to smile. Remember: You are my queen now. I know. - But... - I said: You are my queen. Everyone is waiting for you. I don't see Bishop Fisher here. No, your majesty. And where is sir Thomas Moore? I don't see him here either. Was he not invited? He was most certainly invited, your majesty. Then he chose not to attend. Hungry, ladies? Your grace. Since you were appointed high constable today, what happened in the procession was your fault. I want to know who fired that shot. I am already endeavouring to find out, my lord. Oh, I sincerely trust that you are, your grace. I have not forgotten Pennington. For I feel that was your fault. Here's to the Boleyns. The Boleyns! And England's new queen! Oh, Mary! And it's all for me! How was the coronation? It was a cold, meagre and uncomfortable thing. And your absence was noted, sir Thomas. How is her majesty bearing up under all this? I am no longer allowed to see her. And it is increasingly difficult for us to exchange letters. I'm going to try and see her. That would be so dangerous. Even to speak a word in her praise is to risk imprisonment. Nevertheless. I have been thinking about the past, when I believed the king to be the most enlightened and promising prince in christendom. I was sure his reign would be a golden age. I had such high hopes... Bishop Fisher has been placed under house arrest. You should beware yourself, Eustace. You will all be honourable, discreet, just and thrifty in your conduct. You will present a godly spectacle to others, attend mass daily and display a virtuous demeanour. On pain of instant dismissal and banishment, you must not quarrel, swear... or say evil and lewd things. Nor ever behave lewdly. You will set a standard for everyone else. Do you understand? Yes, your majesty. And you don't go to brothels. I will keep here a copy of Tyndale's english bible. All of you are free to read it, and draw spiritual nourishment from it... for the old days are gone. Everything is changed now. Thanks to his majesty, you have all been delivered from the darkness and bondage of papal thraldom, idolatry and superstition. This is a new beginning. For me. For you. And for England. Sir. Lady Mary, I have come to inform you of the judgements made recently by his grace, the archbishop of canterbury. His majesty's marriage to your mother has been declared null and void. Your mother was never legally queen of England, and must now accept the title of dowager princess. Just as you have no longer the right to call yourself princess, but from now on must be known to all as lady Mary. At the same time, his majesty's recent marriage to queen Anne has been declared legal and valid. Her coronation took place in london this past week. I know of no queen of England save my mother. And I will accept no other queen, except my mother. In which case, I have to tell you that you are forbidden to communicate in any way with your mother, from this day forward. May I not even write to her? Not even a farewell note, considering your... intransigence. Sir Thomas Moore, my lady. Sir Thomas. Your majesty. Forgive me for receiving you like this, but I do not feel well. What you suffer is known to a great many people, both here and abroad. As is the injustice of it, as well as the grace with which you endure it. Now it seems... I must cease to call myself queen... Even though I was crowned so, and anointed. They say that if I refuse, the king will withdraw his fatherly love for my daughter. I shall not yield, neither for my daughter's sake or anyone else's. Not for a thousand deaths would I consent to damn my soul, or that of my husband the king. Please forgive me again, sir Thomas. I am not very used to visitors any more. They are mostly forbidden me. How did you get permission? I wrote to mr. Cromwell personally. Then you are a brave man. I'd be a coward to do otherwise. I cannot pretend to be detached from these events. I have been encouraging your supporters in parliament, and elsewhere, to speak their minds - and stand up for you. - Thank you. Sir Thomas. Thank you. Majesty. Anne... sweetheart. I can't. Not now. While the baby... Exquisite, isn't she? Lady Eleanor Luke. Her family has an estate in Oxfordshire. Shall I talk to her on your behalf? Naturally. How do you like life at court, Mark? - I feel... I feel twice fortunate, my lord. - Twice? Once for being allowed to come here, and twice for the patronage of your family. We like to patronize artists. Men of talent. The painter Holbein stayed with us, and my sister supports many musicians and choirs. Yes, well, your sister is quite a talented musician herself... as well as a very beautiful young woman. - Even though... - Even though...? Not as beautiful as her brother. What's this? The final decision of the curia in Rome. They have found for Katherine. They declare my new marriage invalid, and any children produced from it, illegitimate. The pope threatens to excommunicate me if I do not return to Katherine. He's too late. Hold on Hold on. Hold on. Hold on How brave! Here it comes. And I want you to organize jousts, banquets and masques to celebrate the birth of my son. I can't decide whether to call him Henry or Edward. And I've already asked the french ambassador to hold him at the font during his christening. If he drops him, it's war. It's here, it's here. Push! Push. - What is it? What's happened? - Nothing! Nothing! Your majesty has given birth to a very healthy baby girl And did you not find such occurrences shocking, eminency? Your majesty, I am a venetian. I come from a city where all the men are gamblers and all the women whores. What is there to be shocked about, huh? Majesty. Majesty. I'm so sorry. You and I are both young, and by god's grace, boys will follow. - Lady Eleanor. - Your majesty. - Do you play chess? - Yes, your majesty. Come, let's play. That's my first move.
