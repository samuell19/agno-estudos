[¶] Well, well, well. - What's up, man? - Hey, man, what's going on? - What do you want? - Nothing. I just wanted to wish you good luck on your big outing. - Somebody a little nervous? - No, why would I be nervous? It's not like you're gonna break the record, right? Dude, that's what this whole trip's all about. You're just jealous because there's no way you are ever gonna beat me. - That sounds like a challenge. - It's supposed to. I guess we'll have to see about that, won't we? You will see about that. You just keep watching our webisodes, buddy. You'll see my elite team in action. Your "elite team"... you mean the bimbo and the make-out squad? Trust me, I'll be watching to see if you find anything worth my time. That's fine if you want to follow in the footsteps of greatness. I'll see you when you get there. I gotta go. Okay, good-bye, Team DNA. Good-bye. As always, we await your next challenge. This is Team DNA signing off. - ANDREW: Team DNA? - DALLAS: Yeah. I just made it up. It's, like, our handle. You get it? Yeah, I get it. I just think we could be something a little more cool, like Team Rabid Badger. REESE: Seriously, Andrew, couldn't you find a better friend than this to come with us? - You know, Reese-- - Than Dallas? DALLAS: Where are you gonna get all the computers? - REESE: Oh, my God. - ANDREW: Yeah. REESE: What? Who cares about computers? DALLAS: The only people that know how to work all this stuff besides me are those two. ANDREW: I bring him because he does the work. I don't have to do it. DALLAS: You're nothing, nothing without me. ANDREW: It's, like, the most important piece of equipment I have. It's like going on a treasure hunt with no treasure map. DALLAS: I swear to God, I'll crawl right back there. I'll do it. - I'll jump over the seat. - Stop it! - I'll do it! - No! Yeah, you like that? Like where that's going? Yeah. Get off, Dallas. I farted. I farted. I farted. Oh, my God! [NO AUDIO] [¶] Please. Please, you don't have to do this. Please! Please don't. Please. Please. Please. Run! Run, hurry! [DOG BARKS, GROWLS] - DALLAS: Trouble? - We're fine, thanks. - Tell me you got it. - Have I ever failed? Oh, yes! Yeah, wow, yippee. Can we get on the road, please? This place sucks. I just have to log in and punch in the coordinates. So close to the record now! We have to hide this one somewhere really tough. Obsessed. Hi, boys. Like what you see? What, you were never into hide-and-seek? Yeah, like, when I was six. Who has time to care about this? About five million people around the world, actually. Thirteen million, and people keep trying to hide it in harder and harder places. But they've never been able to challenge us, huh? Like what you see? Wanna see more? ANDREW: How many subscriptions do we have now? DALLAS: Almost 10,000, buddy. People can't get enough of us. 42 in 10 days. That's just one away from the record. And this case has only been found two other times. We gotta hide this somewhere impossible. Why don't we try Reese's pants? We all know no one's ever been able to crack that code. Ha ha, dumbass. Reese, I promise. Mimosas and massages in two days. When I agreed to come on this trip, I thought we'd be seeing the country, - not hanging out in junkyards. - I know. But we have one more stop, these boys will be Internet legends, and you and I will be on the beach for two weeks straight. Mmm, beaches. You always know my soft spot. - I hate you sometimes. - I know. Let's get these boys motivated, come on. All right, boys, let's go. Okay, great, the next cache is up. Like what you see? Wanna see more? Look at the title. "Ultimate Doom"? What a title. Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom. They'd better try harder next time. - Hey, guys, there's wireless in the car. - Just a second. DALLAS: Wow, I'm really scared of these 2D graphics. REESE: Quit messing around the get the numbers, Dallas. Jeez. Yeah, I got it. DALLAS: Geohunt Expedition 26, log 41. We are on our way to the final destination, which will break the absolute world record. Here we are in the car, with the ever-so-stylish, ever-so-sexy Reese McKay. I'm just the driver in this insanity... Captain Dork. And her stunning sidekick, Taryn Walden, who's just come off another adventure in geohunting. And if she doesn't get to a hotel soon, will sabotage this expedition. Honestly, couldn't we have thought of a better vacation than this? What could be better than this? We're making history here. We got the star-crossed lovers in the back, rural America, danger at every turn-- what could be better? Yeah. Action, mystery, suspense... and the entire world is watching at the edge of their seats. Yeah, the entire world of nerds. ...entire world of nerds. Get that thing out of my face. TARYN: Snap, girl! I'm just the driver in this insanity, Captain Dork. I can't wait till this is over. Couldn't we have thought of a better vacation... ...than this? You've had your chance. DALLAS: Our mission is almost complete. Our goals are almost achieved. But the fans at home wanna know, one more time: Taryn, when are you gonna marry this meathead? Wouldn't you all like to know? That's right, baby. Give me a kiss. The fans at home don't want to see that. Shut up and give them their moment. I want you to think long and hard about me. Hi, boys. Like what you see? You wanna see more? I want you to think long and hard about me. CONTROLLER: I can't wait to meet you. Wanna play a game with me? [DEVICE BEEPS] [BEEPS INCREASE IN TEMPO] [DEVICE BEEPS FRANTICALLY] [BEEPS FRANTICALLY] [GIRL SCREAMS] REESE: Oh, great. Now we're lost in a wildlife preserve. DALLAS: Don't worry about it. We'll find out where we are. REESE: Those animals look creepy. DALLAS: Tell me about it. Oh, God! We're in the middle of nowhere... and my car is filthy! Look! Welcome to the great outdoors, babycakes. I don't want my car to get stuck. I'll push it out if it gets stuck. Yeah. We'll all watch Andrew push it out if it gets stuck. Whatever, but I'm not sleeping in a tent again tonight. Good luck. Thanks! Hey, can you hand me the pliers? - Is this it? - No! I'll get it. Maybe I could be a little bit more helpful. It looks so easy on the box. It's like you need an engineering degree to put this together. We've done it before. Doesn't that thing go in that thing? Yeah, the thing in the thing. That makes sense, thanks. Jerk. Watch. Be my guest. - This thing... - This is gonna be good. REESE: This thing goes in this thing. And this goes here. And... Presto! If you knew how to do that the whole time, why didn't you help me before? Because I didn't want to sleep in the tent again, and seeing as how it's getting late, I figured I'd step in. Okay, O great goddess of tent building, I will never doubt your powers again. You know, the sun sets every day, and yet few people take the time to fully enjoy it. Hey, do you think when we get back to California we can look at those apartments I found online? What? Can't we just enjoy this moment and not talk about moving in together? No! I am sick of never being in the same place. I don't know how much longer I can wait around. Wait around? Baby, when this is all over, I'll have so much money I'll be able to buy you ten houses. Andrew, it's not about the money. It's about having a home, with you, together. I love you. Whatever. Hey! I love you too. DALLAS: Hey, lovebirds! Get over here and put this together before it gets dark. Next time, just us two. Sure. [GIRL STRUGGLES, MOANS] [GASPS] [COUGHS] [CRIES] Wow, what got you inspired? Yeah, look at you. I figured I'd come along, get a piece of the action. Who are you and what did you do with my friend? Seriously! I'm sick of just driving. I'm ready to face the danger of the sport. It is a sport, right? More like a hobby. It still takes some skills to do what we do, though. All right, let's get moving. Come on. Yeah, try and keep up. I'll be ready. Oh, my God. The turtle. Timothy. History. Global contentment. Hieroglyphic. Adaptable. Nomadic. Automatic GPS. They will always return to their source. Walk to me, Timothy. Walk, walk, walk... Walk to me. Walk! [DEVICE BEEPS] Tired already? No! So what's the deal with you and Drew? You gonna get married or what? Girl, I can't even get him to move in with me. - He's crazy about you. - Really? Yeah, definitely. You should do him a favor and make him marry you. I don't know, I don't want to force it, you know? I know, but if you want something in this world, sometimes you just have to take it! I want to believe it's a little bit more romantic than that. So, are you gonna start it up? Start up what? - Dallas. - Ew, no. Screwing him would be like the time I screwed my science professor. - Remember that? - You got an A in that class, though. I sure did. I think you and Dallas would be cute. You guys could get married and have big-brained babies, and talk about chaos theory and C++ programming. Hell no. No. Do you guys even see this? See what? It's an old building. Are you guys kidding me? This is so awesome. Let's just go. It'll be fun. Come on. Hey, guys, wait up. I said wait up! This is it. - Hey, girls, girls. - Yeah? Let me get a picture of you in front of this. This is cool. Come on, come on. Line up, line up. DALLAS: Okay, you ready? One, two... Yeah, sorry. Sorry. One, two, three. [CAMERA CLICKS] Oh, look at 'em! They're almost here. Get into position. DALLAS: This is so cool. All right! Here we are with Team DNA-- I mean Team Rabid Beaver... - It's "badger." - Whatever. And we're about to make history once again. We're at the site of our final cache, which will break the record, and it looks to be... ooh, several stories. You guys are lame. There's no way I'm carrying this up the stairs. Are you sure? Uh, yeah. Hey, girls, why don't you give a little hello to your fans back home? - Hi. - Hi. Hey, the building still has power. Wow. Hey, let's just lock in the coordinates. [BEEPS] All right. Let's go find some stairs, huh? Anybody? - Now. - Oh, my God. Will you get that thing off of me? Seriously. Get that thing off of my ass. Only four more flights of stairs, guys. We so should have gone straight to Miami. I know. I could totally use a margarita right now. Oh, this sucks! Let's just get this over with, okay? Hey, check that out. Hey, look at that, look at that. TARYN: Look at that. Where'd Reese go? Washing her hair for the third time today? No, she's probably hiding from you. I'm right here. Don't tell me to lock it up. You lock it up. I wasn't scared. I'm an idiot! - TARYN: What is it? - ANDREW: It's arts and crafts. This must have been the art. DALLAS: This is so cool. Hey, what's in here? Hey, throw this in my backpack and give me my flashlight. Okay, boys and girls, our cache should be right through here. [DOOR CREAKS] [DEVICE BEEPS RAPIDLY] What is this place? Must be the wildlife reserve HQ. Yeah, figured that out for myself. REESE: Is there usually treasure in places like this? I was hoping they'd get a little more creative on this one. I'm putting the numbers in now. What a letdown, huh? Let's see what they left us. Quit fooling around, Andrew. Come on. Just grab it. Come on. What the hell is that? It's a freakin' arm. I have to know if it's real. Yep, you guys, it's real. It's real! - Miami, here we come. - That's what I'm talkin' about. Uh, what about that? It couldn't possibly be real. It's just there to scare us. Dude, after months of finding yo-yos and action figures, we finally hit the jackpot! Are you out of your mind? Doesn't it bother you that somebody died holding that case? No, we don't know that anybody died. It's just an arm. Besides, people die every day. Let's just get it and get out of here. Taryn, this is a really bad idea. I agree, sweetheart, but there is no way that that is real. It's gotta be part of the game. I just have a really bad feeling. It's just your gut talking. Exactly. You've had your chance. What we have here is some sort of modified unit. Blue dots, red dots? This thing must be broken. ANDREW: Hey, check out this note. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God. They must've put a lot of time into this. Bravo, gentlemen. Andrew, come on. We gotta get out of here. What a score. CONTROLLER: All right, boys and girls. Everybody take a deep breath. [SLAMS] This is normal, right, guys? For the game? Help! Let us out! Please help! Come on. Come on! Please help! Please help! - Let us out! - Come on! Great work. Take them to the holding chamber. Timothy, look at me. Miami. Margaritas. Are we at the hotel? Not exactly, sweetie. Where are we? I'm trying to figure that out right now, okay? What the hell is going on? Reese, I need you to settle down right now. - What is this place? - I'm figuring it out right now. I knew I should've stayed in the car. Reese, it's gonna be okay, all right? DALLAS: What happened? Where's all our stuff? Where's the money? Oh, son of a bitch! They put us on a reality TV show, and I didn't even sign a contract. Somebody's getting sued for this. I don't think this is a TV show. They put two guys in a cell and see which one'll crack first. Ha ha, very funny. Hey, get your shit together. We need to find the girls. "Get your shit together." "Find the girls." Hey, we've got TV. Where are the boys at? I don't know. [DOORKNOB JIGGLES] Ssh! Andrew! Andrew! - Taryn! - Andrew! Taryn, can you hear me? - Where are you guys? - Can you hear me? We're in some kind of cell! We are too! What the hell is going on? I don't know! Just hold on. We'll figure this out. CONTROLLER: Come here. Come here... Welcome, contestants, to the world's most dangerous game. - What is this? - Ssh! I don't want to miss any clues. The rules are simple. You make it back to safety and you keep your pathetic lives. Aw, wicked! Shortly after this presentation, you'll be given a GPS transmitter, allowing you to see all the other participants in the game. Your team is marked blue. But you be careful of that little red team, because they're a sneaky little lot. Some of them might not be so friendly and they might want to play. I'm scared. Taryn, I'm scared. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, Reese. And don't worry-- you can have a five-minute head start... plenty of time to devise a plan and set a course to safety. Is this some kind of sick game? Remember, everyone is watching your location via the transmitter on your ankle. Hey! Forgiveness. REESE: Taryn, why are they watching us? I don't know why they're watching us. I love you. You asshole! Is this some kind of joke? This is just part of the game, all right? Game, my ass! Did you see that girl? Just calm down. That was just some stupid home video. I will not calm down! We're going to fucking die here! Fuck! What are we gonna do? This can't be real. We would've heard of something like this, right? - Dallas! - Where is the money? Where's the money? Dallas, it's not about the money, okay? I never wanted you... I just didn't want you to hurt anymore. That's all. I swear, I didn't enjoy any of it. I didn't know you don't hurt no more. Wish you didn't move! You wouldn't stop moving. I just wanted you guys to be together. I'm sorry, baby. We don't belong here. [CAMERA BEEPS] REESE: Ow! Sorry. I don't have any tools. Hey, Dallas, have you ever seen anything like that? No. They're modified units like the one upstairs. They show our location in relationship to our surroundings. Like the video said, we're the blue team. What about your laptop? Have you tried to contact anybody? Oh, that's a good idea! Yes. We don't get a signal down here. Thanks, smartass. I wouldn't be too worried. I think it's just a joke, anyway. I don't care if this is real or fake. If I'm not in Miami by tomorrow morning, I'm gonna kill all of you! Relax, cupcake. It'll be okay. Dallas, seriously, which way do we need to go? We just go up the stairs and down the hall, and then into the kitchen-- we make ourselves a sandwich. That's where we get the revolver and the rope, and then some candles. Talk to the butler on the way out. Does that sound like fun? Smartass. Get me to an exit. E-X-I-T. Okay, okay, okay. That one. ALL: Asshole. REESE: I just wanna get out of here. Hey, we have to keep moving. Where? Where's the exit? Where's it at? Whatever it takes, let's just get out of here. Just give me a second. It should be right around the corner. We're almost there. Come on. Let's go. - Get the door, Dallas. - It should be right through there. Fuck. Dallas, this is getting ridiculous. What the fuck is going on? I think there's another way out. It's just gonna take us a little bit more time. Whatever it takes. Let's just get out of here, please. - Come on, let's go! - Just give me a second! [DEVICE BEEPS] Okay, I think I found another way out. It's gonna take us a little longer, but I think we can do it. We've really gotta figure this game out, guys. Okay, whatever it takes. Let's just get out of here, please. Let's just get out of here. Come on! I found another way. Fine, whatever. Go, you guys, come on. All right. Why'd the lights go out? Don't worry, babe. It's just an old building. Andrew, we're gonna be okay, right? What's the deal with the red dots? Oh, wow. We gotta move-- now! This place kicks so much ass. Hey, what's going on with that thing? I don't have time to explain. The exit's right up there. What is it? I'm not going any further until you tell me what's going on. - Tell me! - It's fine. We just have to keep moving. Hold on a second. Let me check the GPS. I think I figured this game out, you guys. Taryn! Run, run, run, run! This can't be real! - Dallas! Dallas, I need you! - We have to stick together! Dallas, this isn't a game anymore. Dallas, come on! I need you! This can't be real! This can't be a game. Dallas! Dallas, I need you to concentrate. Dallas, okay. Okay, sweetie. Okay, yes. Dallas, come on! Look at me! Dallas! This door's not gonna hold much longer. Okay, we need to go up the stairs. No, wait. I don't know. I don't know. I have it! Down two flights of stairs, then-- then through the main hall, and that should take us to the entrance. On three, we head to the door. One, two... three! There, there, darlin'. Everything gonna be over real soon. Oh, please! I have so much to live for. You're on your way, sweetheart. Don't you worry your sweet little head about that. Our Lord in heaven, He has a plan for us all, and I know He just misses you. Please, I just want to go home. What do you want from me? I just want to take you to paradise, sugar. You know, away from all this filth and misery. I'm just... It's not supposed to be like this. Relax. The ride's gonna sting just a little. I'm-- I'm sorry, darlin'. I don't know what came over me. Here. It's all right. It's all right. I just wanna go home. Promise I won't tell anyone. Go on, now. Git. Before I change my mind. Git! I said git! Now-- now I'm terribly sorry. Terribly awful of me to lie... but I just couldn't watch you die all helpless. You understand, don't you? Oh, God. You're so pretty. Just like my mama. It's okay. Shh. It's all right. Yeah, it's all right. It's all right. It's okay. What are you doing? Come on, come on! We have to go! Are you sure that's the way? Yeah, yeah, yeah! I think so. - You think so? - Figure it out! What does it look like to you? Hurry. Andrew, come on! [PANTS] Go, go! Hurry. Come on! Come on! Take Taryn and go! REESE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to come here. I didn't even want to be here. Look at me! You don't have to do this. Blood. Wine. The elixir of the Lord. Jesus in a wineglass. Jesus uncorked. I am your decanter. Dallas, why are you stopping? Just a second, just a second, Let me think. I gotta figure this out. Dallas, you need to pick a route now. This doesn't make any sense! The exit should be right here. Well, you gotta figure it out. Andrew, what are you doing with that? To protect us. I'm not going out without a fight. Which way? Dude, easy! What the fuck is your problem? Stop it! Stop it, you guys. What? They're here right now. They're here. Come on now! Come on! Andrew, what are you doing? Listen, we need an anchor. I'll stay behind and slow him down. Dude, don't be crazy. We have to stick together. You can't leave me. You can't leave me! You can't leave me to die! You can't leave me. [METAL CLANKS OUTSIDE] They knew where we'd be. They knew we'd come this way. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Andrew, no! He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay. There's no way out. It's okay. [WHISTLES] Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me? Why? It's okay. It's okay, Taryn. Look at me. Look at me. We're gonna get out of this, I promise. Hey, we are okay. Look, it's okay, darling. We're gonna get home. We're gonna make our way back to the car and just forget about this place, okay? When we get home, we'll get married and have 10 kids, okay? Just forget about this, okay? We'll get home, get married, and have 10 kids. Guys. I think I found a way out, but I can't be sure. What does the map say? I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. This place is one big maze. There are multiple exits. I can't tell which one leads us out. I think we have to get to the ground floor. Whatever it is, it's better than staying around here. Let's go. Okay, this way. There's no time. Come on. What is the GPS telling you? DALLAS: I don't know! The unit's designed to distract us, not help us. Look. Of course! Well, there's gotta be a control room here, then. If the map was designed to lead us in the wrong direction, we should just do the opposite of what it says, right? Oh, I cannot believe how stupid we've been. The only thing that's good for is letting us know when someone's gonna die. I'm sick of being part of someone's game. This has to be right! We're on the ground floor of a four-story building. Look at the security lines. We're followin' those. Okay. Find them! Where's my fucking mic? I knew it. Oh, guys, I'm not sure about this. Baby, I trust you. Dallas, you need to trust him too. Okay. Let's do it. Oh, wow. These pipes go for miles. I got a bad feeling about this. I'm not getting a signal on my GPS. Good. Then that means they can't track us. Dallas, we're a team, okay? Remember, okay, we stick together? Team DNA. Team DNA. Let's go. Hey, you guys... I knew you'd get us out of here, baby. Was there ever any doubt? Come on! What are we supposed to do now? We gotta get back to the car. I just don't know what direction that would be in. We have to figure out this game. I can do it, I promise. - I can figure it out, I swear. - Dallas, let it go, seriously. Hey, you know what happened last time we used that. Voyeuristic bastards! [HUMS] - Do you still have your laptop? - What? The cameras-- they're wireless. Oh, of course. I can probably lock onto the RF signal and get the exact coordinates of where the signal's coming from. Just a sec. Crap, my battery's almost dead. Hold on. Oh, come on. - Dallas, you need to hurry. - Just give me a second. Okay, I'm in, I just gotta lock it in. I just gotta lock it in. Oh my God, Look at how many cameras they have. Dallas, you hear that? They're coming right now. - I'm almost there. - All right, Dallas. - I'm almost there. - Hurry up. The signal's coming from that general direction. So, over there-- Fuck! My battery just died! TARYN: They're here! Look! - Come on. - Come on, come on. Well, at least we know where the signal's coming from. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you goin'? What about all that road talk before? Why don't we just go back to the car and go home? Why are we going towards the danger? Dallas, listen. Andrew's right, okay? They have cameras set up everywhere. They know our every move. Yeah, look-- we know where the killers are, and we know where the control room is, right? So that's where we're gonna go and finish this damn game. [BIRDS CHIRP] Reese! She's alive? Taryn? Andrew? Taryn? Andrew? T-Taryn? Taryn! CONTROLLER: There we go. Oh, where's my trail? There's my trail. There we go. Over the hill. Around and around we go. Sophistication is not necessarily a good thing. I wonder what me psychiatrist would say. Watch out for the animals? A man's sophistication will only become complexity. TARYN: What's that? I think that was a-- - Dallas! - Dallas, where are you? Come on, we have to go. Wait, we can't leave him out here. What if he fell? Look, we know he didn't fall. We know what's out there. Come on. We can't leave him. No! Andrew, no! [DEVICE BEEPS] Relax, boy. Just relax. You ain't lost. 'Cause you saw the way. It's Dallas! He's alive! We gotta go back for him. No, we're headed to the control room. Andrew, that's your friend! We can't leave him out here. I don't know if we can trust this thing. He's so close we have to try. Okay. It's all right. Here to show you the way. What's wrong? It stopped working. Andrew. Dear Lord, grant me the skill to make my kill swift. Guide this arrow with the Holy Spirit and bless His Spirit so I may send another one of Your children home. I pray in Your name, God. Amen. Come on! Why you-- why'd you go and do that, boy? That was silly. But I forgive you. Now, where're you off to? I ain't mad at you. I just want to give you something. That's all. Saint Gabriel... be my protection in my darkest hour. Be my armored shield against the wicked. Saint Gabriel, be my protection in my darkest hour. Be my strong arm against the wicked. Saint Gabriel... be my protection in my darkest hour. Be my-- Be my protection against the wicked. I don't understand. It says he's right here. No, look, it's over there. Past those trees. Come on. Come on. [MAN GROANS] - Dallas! - Shh! He's gotta be around here somewhere. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What are we gonna do? It's a trap. It's a trap. I can't believe they know every move. You know what? Fuck this thing. We need to make our way back to the car. I love you. Go. Go. Go! Come on, come on! Go. Go. Come on. - You okay? - I think so. No! We are going down the path. Down the path. What will we turn into? Around in circles. Don't get lost. Down... Can you watch out for the trolls? Why? Why are you doing this to us? [IGNITION SPUTTERS] You! You killed them! You killed Andrew and you killed Reese! I hate you! You did it! It's your fault! Why did you kill Andrew? Why did you kill Reese? I hate you! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! You brought us out here! Why did you do that? What did you do? Why did you bring us here? Fuck! You killed Andrew! He's the only person that's ever loved me! Now he's gone! You did it! I loved him! [DOOR OPENS] Welcome. Don't! Don't move. I'll kill you. Welcome. Did you have a pleasant run? I'm gonna put this right here, okay? Okay? Did you know that every animal... in the world would kill a kangaroo on sight? Huh? You know why? See, kangaroos are hollow, little, weak animals. Do I look like a kangaroo to you? How 'bout some tea? You want some tea? Ah, wait-- you know what? Just hold that thought. Okay? Hold onto it. There you are. Yeah. There you are. There you are. Try it. Go on and try it. I'm going to... paint your picture. How 'bout that? Do you mind? There. Yeah. Perfect. Hold on to that thought. I know you probably want to kill me, huh? But you don't see the gift that I've given you. The gift of knowing the power of murder. And death. You-- you-- you felt it, didn't you? Yes. Taking a human life is a big deal. It's a feeling that can haunt you till the day you die. Oh, what's this? Let me get a shot of yours, here. It's not just... Start again. You see, for a certain special breed of people, they feel the power-- the power that no drug can duplicate. And like a drug, they get addicted. There's no worse predator on Earth than a human being.
