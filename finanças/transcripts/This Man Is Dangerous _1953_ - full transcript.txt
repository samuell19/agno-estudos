Attention, attention! An American gangster named Lemmy Caution has escaped from Oklahoma State Prison and has secretly entered France. A general warning has been issued against Lemmy Caution who is traveling in the direction of Marseilles. His particulars have been verified by multiple parties. His real name is Caution, spelled C-A-U-T-I-O-N Call the Marseilles Police. He is traveling in a stolen gray Dolage. I repeat: A stolen gray Dolage. Registered: 862-N59. Lemmy Caution speaks French with a slight American accent. Attention, this man is dangerous! This man is dangerous! THIS MAN IS DANGEROUS McPhee isn't here? Why not? Maybe he made a deal with Goyaz. Or he fell in love with Miranda. Oh, poor McPhee! Anyway, I haven't got a moment to lose. Hey! What are you staring at, you want a photo of the Captain? - You're talking to me? - On first sight? Yes. Just in time. I was looking for someone to talk to. Is that tub yours? First off: It's not a tub. It's a Krissocraft. Secondly, I must warn you: I'm very tough. That's too bad. I'd really like to take a ride in your Krissocraft. Do you think I'm a taxi? - Understood! How much? 10,000? I'm not for sale. 15? - Go on, go on! You're wasting your breath. 20? I prefer that you leave. Are you gonna leave or not? Fine. Don't get worked up. Goodnight! Are you still tough? A little less! Perfect. You work for Goyaz? You work for Goyaz? If he needs men for The New York, he'll take me on! Is there a young woman on the Black Swan? You're still thirsty, huh? A blonde! An American? Miss Van Zelten! Miranda Van Zelten! Something like that. You're gonna tell me everything! All I did was bring her! The New York will anchor in the morning. Where? I swear I know nothing! No one told me anything! Between us Goyaz has a point. One last word: Have you seen another guy on his boat? Think carefully! - Yes! A motorboat came with a guy and a lady. - How long ago? - Less than 2 hours. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Zero. Nothing on zero. Change for 1000 dollars, please. Make change for Mademoiselle Van Zelten. Gentlemen, place your bets! Bets are placed... Bets are closed. Zero. - Oh! 4 times in a row? I should have played by my instincts! I don't think I had any! - Say... - Excuse me. My dear, you don't seem to be doing well tonight. I'm sick. Don't worry, you suffer because you're alive. Alive? Then there's nothing left but to die. Yes, that's life. This scheme isn't working. Goyaz is crazy! What do you so fear from Goyaz that you'd take a swim instead? I don't like the water, but that doesn't mean I won't end up stuffed in a barrel. But it isn't Goyaz that's brought me to this. And yet I almost pulled it off. This business of trying to make myself forget! I can't stay here! I'm getting out of here! Go ahead, there's your exit. So you're not in on it? Not in on it? I'm a hostess. How could I prove I didn't bring myself to this? Well I don't care, if they hate me, it's fine with me and what I want. So what are you complaining about? Everything else. I don't have the slimmest chance. Oh really? What did you see? Are you a customer? Then I saw nothing at all. Exactly. You never saw me... But if you want to see another day, I advise you to keep it tightly shut. I don't like those that rat out my friends. - Are you a friend of Goyaz? - From childhood. Oh, now I understand. I've got nothing left to say. I'll be sure to keep my mouth shut. That's perhaps for the best. Go on. Go powder your drunken nose. I'm going to remember this evening. I hope so. - Hands in the air! - What the... Everyone up against the wall. Quick! Goyaz! Come here. I want to talk to you. Come on! - Yes, yes. Cowards always leave blood behind. Everyone else stay where you are. I've got friends at the windows! You can turn around now. I like that better. You almost had me scared. Aren't you Lemmy Caution? Do you wait here to show yourself? We must see things clearly. Are there a lot of you? I'm all alone. But for a chicken-liver like you, that's already too many. If you start joking, then I know we can talk. I'm always agreeable. How much do you want, Lemmy? Name your price. I'll make you a kind of proposition. I haven't had to work tonight. They've left a small fortune on zero, these suckers. Fifty-fifty? Or do you have another idea? I've got an idea. A very simple one. Beyond discussion, and it's named McPhee! McPhee, the guy who's sleeping in your office. You didn't even give him a chance, and he was my friend. Let me explain, Lemmy... It's really the opposite. Listen to me. Listen... You want Van Zelten's daughter? She's got mines, railways, airplanes... Guns! One for McPhee... The other for me, on the part of my friend. Coat, purse... How much did Goyaz steal tonight? Oh, I wouldn't know! You're so right, that would be petty. Take that, come on. For my travel expenses. Continue to remain calm, that's your ocean insurance. You can get up now, it's disgusting down there. I've never been so thrilled in my whole life! Speak French! People don't get subtitles here. I tell you I adore being in danger! Of that I'm certain! Yeah, yeah...Let's not argue, or we'll run out of gas. Who brought you to that boat? Oh, did you see the flying fish? In Honolulu, there are all sorts of fantastic things. You know Honolulu? No, I don't get out often. Who brought you to the boat? A boy, naturally. Much nicer than you. What nerve! He must have been a stunner! He took me dancing, I remember he talked... with such warmth, such urgency, such importunity, it's not surprising. If only you could have seen it, it was so funny! But why did you do that? I'm taking you away! You're kidnapping me? Not me, you wretched little blonde. It's Goyaz, the owner of the boat. - Really? - Really, to take off tomorrow, perhaps for Honolulu! But in the hold. Do you know what the hold is? - Below? - Below! So no flying fish, no cocktails, no dancing... And lots of trouble for Papa! You're lucky I'm taking care of you. Kidnapping? I've never been kidnapped before! - Coat! - Thanks. - And purse! - Thank you. Is there anything to see here? - No, just a little crab. You'll understand better in Chicago. You sure do remind me of Marlon Andrews. Or Humphrey Bogart. Or maybe Burt Lancaster? - Yes. Everyone, in other words! Don't say that. You're very interesting because you retain your mystery. For example, why didn't you call the police about my kidnapping? - I'm sorry, I forgot! - Liar. It's to avoid a scandal! Right away, you're not like the others. You must be pleased, neither are you. But I already said that! - Direction? - You noticed I'm American. - Get in. - If you already know me, how come I don't recognise you? Because I wear dark glasses. How you remind me of John Wayne! James Mason. And Boris Karloff! I don't even know your name! Mulligan. John S. Mulligan. Goodnight, Johnny. Oh, Johnny! Why do I feel so shy with you? I don't ask, but it's a good thing to know. I've a thousand things to say to you, but I don't dare. Will I see you again? - Of course. - When? - We're already together. I'll come for you at 12:30 sharp. Okay. I'll wait for you tomorrow. I'll be better with a little sleep. - Exactly. Everything in order. And all alone. Go to your room and don't come out. I promise. I no longer want to see any boys. That's for sure. Goodnight. Oh Johnny... Johnny, I'd like to know one more thing. It's about the boat. That man you took with you... You didn't kill him, by chance? - Of course I did. - What for? He had such troubles, I was doing him a favor. Lemmy? Oh, Lemmy! You're confused. My name is John Mulligan. That would surprise me. So we're not friends now? You don't remember Constance Galatzi? You're very charming, but truly I don't remember you. - Thank you all the same. - I'm sorry. Come on now, think back. Paris. New Year's Eve at Maxwell's. You had so many whiskies, you couldn't drive yourself home. Or put yourself to bed. Oh yes, so the nurse was you? What are you doing here? Vacation. And you? I'm going to bed. How you've changed! You no longer sleep with girls? Why not? If they're so charming. Or if they seem to like your voice. Want to risk coming to my place? Get in. - Why not the hotel bar? - They don't serve real scotch. I've got a whole case. Good whisky. Being charming doesn't keep me from having a good memory. What are you scared of? Me? - No. Whisky. Lovely family portrait. For a little tigress, it's amazing. Go in there. I'll prepare the baby's bottle. You'll find I have a splendid view! Hello, sucker! Siegella! It's a small world. Come in. - I wouldn't want to put you out... - Lemmy! Some friends of mine. Hello, friends. Don't move, Lemmy! Johnny? Siegella... Tell him to allow me to breathe a little, I'd hate to break something when I'm a guest. Johnny! Make yourself at home, Lemmy. - Your hat? - It's coming. Be seated. There! Maurice. - Whisky? - Isn't that what I came for? - Cigar? - Thanks, but never. How are you feeling, Lemmy? Okay. I was worried about the whisky, but it's good. I wanted to see you. You've had a lot to talk about for two years. Thanks. I've got one too. I know some details that weren't included. You seem like a boy full of life. - Thanks, Doc. - You should remain so. I'm not asking for more. So how did you get involved in the Van Zelten affair? Because it's mine. Forgive me, but the idea was my own. That's my privilege, I thought of it first. Before Goyaz perhaps, but not before me. Listen, Siegella. Among friends there's nothing to discuss... Listen, I'm not Goyaz! And since you don't agree... You can join him. Taking in the scene, it was obviously your handiwork. I'm very clever, Lemmy. Very! Nothing in your hand, nothing in your pocket...All in your head. And never any evidence. M. Siegella is never involved. So what's your decision? What's my decision? What do you want me to decide? You think I'll bust out crying? I'm sorry, but that's all. Everything worked perfectly. Tonight I met the kid, her well-known charm, her smile! And now she's sleeping with my picture under her pillow. Tomorrow we'll meet again... Give me two weeks and I'll marry her. Daddy will provoke a crisis, no gangsters in the family, and I'll extract dollars from him for a quickie divorce. Not bad, eh? It's as if your butler married the Queen of England. It's amusing. I don't know your plan, but I'm definitely facing the till. Taking off is one thing, but finishing is something else. A divorce is small potatoes. I want a million dollars, and I'll have it. Maybe. But the kid is crazy about me. If she asks me to defend her... I don't know how to resist the ladies. Just ask Constance. It complicates things, doesn't it? To hell with friendship! You've got some nerve, don't you? I say what I think. I'd really like to give you a chance. If you continue to pursue this romance... and if you take the kid in hand, leading her to a villa that I've set up...What do you say? How much? 100,000 dollars! Out of a million? Not enough! Don't you think you're pushing it? Don't take me for an idiot, Siegella. Tonight you could kill me. I won't argue with that. But we talking business here, and that's something else entirely. But if I get mixed up with the kid, you don't have to kidnap her... and you get 48 hours of peace while she's kept on ice. It will be 200,000 dollars exactly! The same as Daddy's price. I'm listening. It isn't grass growing up there, is it? I might be making a mistake, but I like you. You're on, Lemmy. - Thanks, boss. Do you have a card? "John Mulligan, Insurance Protection". That's not bad. Have two dozen red roses sent to Miranda Van Zelten... at the Miramar with this card. Sure. You think of everything. I never forget a thing. I'll see you tomorrow evening. You can go with Constance. - Can I have my valuables back? - You're part of the family now. - Johnny! - Goodnight, my friends. In the world I've had nothing but trouble, it's all too clear Oh, women! Now I tell myself you know this song too well... Ah, women! So you're going off with the boys? Then off to a deserted island? I know a nice arsenic solution. Go on, tell me off! What for? There are pros and there are cons. I'm always with the pros. I'm not unhappy about this conversation with Siegella. He's a real specialist. Between us, I know he has great respect for you. And I can ride along for free. - At my side? - Behave yourself, Lemmy. That's not what you said on New Year's Eve when you grabbed me and kissed me on the forehead. That wasn't me. I know. And it wasn't me either. I slipped an envelope into your pocket. No, that one! You're a pickpocket too? All kinds of women rolled into one. An advance for your cigarettes. A gift from Siegella. He's perfect, Siegella! I couldn't do better, than to thank him through your better self. Forgive us, M. Siegella, but the house always verifies the currency. It seems authentic. But if it's authentic, where did it come from? Maybe I can find out. Bank robbery. Mexican border? No. Kansas City? Ah! List of the stolen money, very nice. You might be a legal bank customer M. Siegella, but if you withdrew two million dollars... With never any evidence! It's not true! The evidence... Come in. Your whisky, Mr. Mulligan. You didn't ask for it tonight, but I thought I'd welcome you. You're a great guy! Thank you, sir. A nasty scheme is afoot and all bets are off. For Siegella, that is. Good morning, Mademoiselle! Hello? Louis 11383, it's an emergency. Hello, I'm listening. Yes? This is Suzanne. Mademoiselle is gone. - Where? - I don't know! - Without telling you? She left me a note, I'll read it to you: "Dear Suzanne, Don't worry, I had to leave. Miranda." Don't budge, I'll call back. Fine. Miranda's taken off, with Lemmy no doubt. What a bunch of children! Didn't you think the guy was friendly? No, a bastard. He'll pay. What are you doing to do? Call the Majestic. You never know. - Hello, Majestic? - Yes? - M. Mulligan, please. He's not here, Madame. - He's gone? - Yes, Madame. Thank you. Well? Tell Charlie to go to the port. You go to the Vendrome to verify their departure this morning. I'll call Paris first. That bastard! I wonder how he managed to steal the gazelle. Isn't it incredible? It's easy to guess. He has no morals whatsoever. - Mlle Van Zelten, please. - She isn't here, sir. She is for me, we had a date. She's gone, sir. - Gone? - Yes, she's on a trip. - Oh, that bastard! - Excuse me? By herself? Did she leave by herself? - Sir... - I'm John S. Mulligan, insurance officer. I've been assigned to watch Mlle Van Zelten's jewels. You don't say. Yes, I know, I've got a lot to do. Mind you, no one knows what my profession is. That's preferable, Mlle hates being watched. Miranda hasn't answered. She left alone, without a sound, not a peep to be heard? I heard nothing. I was here, sir. - Are you her secretary? - Yes, sir. Mlle was wrong to engage you. - How so, sir? - You'd steal half her admirers. Mr. Mulligan! - For Mademoiselle Van Zelten. - Thank you. Don't bother, they're from me. Thank you, sir. Has somebody already told you you're cute as a button? - Yes, sir. - It's terrible... You're never the first. Tell me... - Suzanne. - Suzanne. If you get any news... Come see me at the Majestic. I won't mind. For me a souvenir. The rest are for you. The bastard! Louis 11383. Quickly! Hello? Any answer? Done. - Pertingeuil? - Through there. - Thank you. It's really true: You can't run. I was looking for you everywhere. At the port, on the street, on the promenade. - Me too. Imagine. At the port, on the street, on the promenade... I also phoned. - So did I. I was following on your heels. I had nothing in mind: Just to make contact. Making plans for Suzanne as well? - Like you. - Then out with it! Do you know where Miranda went? Of course. To Paris. She took a plane this morning. - I thought she was crazy about you. - She still is. Exactly. I have full trust in her. And what about Siegella? If he isn't there before us. He's incredible! I adore him. How about making yourself adored by Miranda while you're at it? "Knockout"! "Knockout"! - "Scandal". - "Knockout". I'll take the blue with the little oleanders. - "Escape". The red... - The red one? - Yes, to dance in! "Stromboli"! I believe that it's "Stromboli", isn't it? Exactly. - Thank you, Madame. How about "Daybreak", the bottle-green ensemble? - No, too modest. - "Carried away",the evening gown? I already saw it. Could I see "Knockout"? Certainly. "Knockout"? You need to show "Knockout". Hurry up! But I'm exhausted! Why couldn't she decide sooner? Oh shut up, it's for Mlle Van Zelten. So what? - I'm taking "Stromboli". - Me too. I don't have time for lunch, but perhaps we could have dinner together. You're not angry, Johnny? I just had to see the collection. That's completely natural. I thought that you'd come to me if you really wanted to. Yes, I really wanted to. I was curious to know if you really liked me. Then you've chosen the simplest way. - Mlle, I'm ordering "Carried away". - It's noted, Mlle Van Zelten. - Mr. Mulligan? - Yes? You're wanted on the telephone. Through there. I hope you won't be long, or I'll be jealous of your friends! That would surprise me. Monsieur? Excuse me, but do you have a light? Certainly! Our surprise is slated for the day after tomorrow, near Paris. I'll give you the exact address. Tomorrow morning at 29 Rue Racine, it's the old Moulange store. Okay. Thank you, sir! My mama warned me... There are so many things in ladies' purses...Out with it! Haven't we seen each other before? It was at the dressmaker's. You were sitting next to Miranda. Cat got your tongue? Oh really? You think I'm scared of you? There are others with me. You can't hide. I consider you the Prime Minister of the King of Fools! And I'm the one watching the house! You can thank Dora, I'm the one who led the expedition, no one else! Such as some business with Goyaz. Does the name Goyaz mean anything to you? Something. He was my friend... And I swore to put holes in the guys who took him out. He wasn't the only one in on it! He was imprudent. If it's true you killed him... Then it's also true that as my name is Dora you'll pay for it. The first chance I get! What have you taken from me? Before God, I want to know for certain if it's really you... But why, why? Go ahead and ask. It's very good to ask questions. I'd rather ask them afterwards! Yes? What? No, that was just a champagne cork. Bring me a bottle of whisky with two glasses. And make my excuses to the neighbors. Thank you. So. Now what? Do we kill each other? Laugh if you want, but I'll be back. And the same goes for Siegella. Him too? About what, Chicago? You're an even bigger bastard than he is! Monsieur pulls off the big one on May 2, with gloves on! He takes advantage of the fearful. Never a trace, but he takes it all..."Pardon me!" He's the one in the driver's seat! I know you got your orders from Siegella, to slaughter Goyaz! It's never the big men who do the dirty work! Just their lackeys. Come in. So...Aren't you glad you came? Good evening, Madame. Good evening, sir. Thank you, sir. As for your classification, I don't agree. The first in the affair was me. As for your complaint, if it's Siegella... I'll gladly fight him with you. Stop stalling, I know you're with him! No, I'm ahead of him. With a canon in my hand. There's the difference. That's not so good for your reputation. On the contrary. I've got a rule: Wait for the end. Listen...I've got something in mind that will hold good. At the dressmaker's, I had a talk with Miranda. And you need to know. If she continues to be lured into Siegella's clutches, the only inheritance left will be in the casino. That is... - Go on, go on! Listen. I'll make you a deal. I've still got some of Goyaz' guys with me. Proven guys who know what to do. You follow me? I'm right behind you. That's all it takes. You've got energy, ideas, initiative. You follow me? Step by step. We'll split the take on Miranda. Fifty-fifty. That means taking on Siegella. Nothing we do could put me off. And what we could do would turn Paris upside-down! Could I meet your guys? Meet us tomorrow at 3:00. Downstairs at the Bar des Roses. Correct, a friend? Bravo, Lemmy! Tomorrow's itinerary: Go to Moulange's in the morning to get the villa's address, In the afternoon the Bar des Roses to organise everything, And in the evening, romance Miranda... Who had me followed? Dora or Siegella? Lots of expense for nothing. I'm getting out, don't stop. CLOSED ON ACCOUNT OF DEATH Luc's already an idiot, it's best not to bother him. Jeannot. If you're done, can we talk? Take a short vacation? And now Lemmy is the "Knockout". Now I know I'll lose no sleep, because I've got nothing to fear. I didn't come here to give you chocolates. We're here to work, agreed? - Agreed, Lemmy. Then I've got to be in charge! I saw Siegella this morning. The surprise party for Miranda will be Sunday afternoon in the villa near Rambouillet. I came here to show you the plan. I've rented a place nearby so we'll know where we should be. Okay? It's convenient for our operation. Our plan is relatively simple. We must take particular care the presentation: Cocktails, dinner, gambling, etc. In short, we'll entertain Miranda until 4:00 in the morning. At 4:30, the plane will land here. We take off with the kid. And Lemmy? He'll need to stay near the villa. Doesn't he like the water? I suppose we can be sure of Suzanne? That's another issue. I think I'll have Suzanne talk to him and say she mistrusts me. Just to gain the trust of our dear Lemmy! For Siegella less would be enough, but let's take enough care so we don't end up getting crushed. We'll have to work quickly. And avoid getting our necks broken. Siegella dead is not a bad thing, but as long as he's alive... It's perhaps best to do business with him. I couldn't care less, it's his hide that I want! Don't worry, you'll have it! Willy! Be ready. So I've got a midnight rendezvous with the goose? We'll hide while we've got the time. Dora, Fredo and Timmy... Will come in the car. Won't they hear us? No, we'll be in the garden. With a full tank, naturally. And Pierrot goes with you. To tell you the truth... That's not a guy who's putting on weight. Suzanne! Through here. Well? I drove from Cannes this morning in Mlle's car... I know about that. What else? Mlle phoned Mr. Mulligan. They talked for 20 minutes. They dine together tonight. - And she adores him. I'll say, even more than is usual with her! You'll pay Suzanne. - I don't like how this is going. - I know. - Have you always wanted a car? - Oh yes! You could get one. I've asked you here on a delicate mission. - Delicate? - Delicate doesn't mean dangerous. It concerns this Mulligan. I need you to tell him a crazy story. You're going to his hotel. The cops must be busy today. Oh, Mr. Mulligan! I'm sorry. It's for me to be sorry. I can't believe my good luck. You were so nice to me in Cannes. Could I ask for your advice? Sure, come on! You won't be afraid to come up to my room? Mr. Mulligan, are you a gentleman? Am I? Oh yes, I am! So...Tell me. - I'm afraid, Mr. Mulligan. This morning, after we discussed Mlle, the phone rang twice. At an interval. When I answered, there was no one there. Twice I answered "Hello"... But no one answered. - Maybe it was a mute. - Maybe. Oh, Mr. Mulligan! - Did you call the switchboard? - Yes. They confirmed that twice someone had asked for Mlle. But that's not all. - Sit down. This afternoon, when I came into the hall... I met a man who seemed to be looking for the number of a suite. What did he look like? I didn't really see him, he was turned the other way. He was wearing a hat. I was thinking perhaps he was looking to steal Mlle's jewels... Not so stupid! And then? - I put them in the hotel safe. Mlle doesn't like it, she always keeps them on her dressing table. But I did it anyway. And as your job is to watch Mlle's jewels... I came here. - You came here, my child... And it seems to me you've done the best thing. If somebody wants jewels... He'll have to take the safe to get them. Only she might tell me off... No, I'll talk to her. Thank you, Mr. Mulligan. You really like Miss Van Zelten, don't you? Mlle is so sweet. Would you like to do her a favor? Certainly. And me at the same time. Whisky? This doll... Is she for real? Or not? Does she want to con me? Or not? So! Tomorrow I'll take Miranda to the country. I've got some friends, they're charming, but completely... That's funny! The kind of guys that in the middle of the night like to go hunting, like those involved in the Coup of 1865. They're not bad, I swear! With their excellent humor... But if Miranda is as sweet as you say... and understands a joke is a joke, and it's difficult to predict her reactions... - With Mlle you never know! - Isn't it the truth. So... The favor you'll do us... is to check in tomorrow night at the Poule d'Or (Golden Goose) in Rambouillet. You'll only have to wait. If I see that the evening is too exciting even for Miranda, I'll phone you and you'll come get her. If Mlle's happy, I won't need to come? Always an argument! But you, Mr. Mulligan... You'll stay? - Maybe. These are old friends, you understand? If I leave, it will offend them. Besides, I too am an excellent night hunter. Give me a cream puff. Shouldn't they be here by now? Look out for Lemmy. Don't worry about it. She's pampered. Fortunately for me, I've classified him. He doesn't look like much of a talker, he's a muscular... And a cerebral is never afraid of a muscular. The business that's fallen into Suzanne's lap... Will take care of everything. But what if he manages to seduce her without us? Without us he's done for. And with us as well! It's about time! Allow me to present the ravishing Miranda Van Zelten. Constance Galatzi. And the devoted John Mulligan at your service. Hello, devotee! Come on in! What a palace you've created here! - Good food, good manners! - Oh yes! Would you like to comb your hair? Certainly, I must look terrible! - Of course not. The repair shop is upstairs. The repair...? Oh yes! My compliments, Lemmy. Don't you admire my powers of seduction? - It's your exactitude that I admire. - For me, it's your discretion. You didn't even greet her. In case it collapses, you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing. She's only another guest. Never any evidence. There will be no collapse! All the same there are problems. The airplane isn't running. It can only be here tomorrow night. That extends by 48 hours the kid's vacation. I'd advise you to make the most of it. I will. You haven't told her anything? On the subject... Were you in on the Kansas City heist? - Why do you ask? - No reason. I thought, because there's never any evidence... Sorry. Damned Lemmy! I'm always thinking of you. Always. I'm a celebral. Blast it Lemmy, I'm most happy to work with you. Me too. What are they doing down there? Don't get worked up. They're repairing the car. We're screwed. Worthless as we are. Why are we setting ourselves up for him? Did we ask for a big shot to come close the deal? I don't at all like this Lemmy Caution. Or this plan, either! I'm telling you, we need to watch him! He's setting us up for something! I've no desire to be at his disposal while he pulls the strings. He doesn't work, he hides things from us... I'm sorry, but I get it. You don't like it? Lemmy will move on. "He's not so bad as that, Jacques!" This dance. How could you? But what's in your head? I wonder if it's even mine. I hear a ringing. - You've drunk too much. It makes no difference... Your habits become a burden, I'd wipe out everything to escape the music! Say... He hasn't perhaps trafficked in whisky, our shady Siegella? The ideas you get! Too many times, I have none at all! To hide in a corner for only half an hour. I didn't sleep last night. Or the night before. Come on, go to bed. You see? It's happening at last. But not that, it's true! 50 more! - Pass! - Hold at 50. - 50, plus 50 more. - Not me, it would kill me. - Pass! - Pass. 40, pick them up. What are you holding? - Yes, you must tell him. - Two 9's! Oh, terrific! How did you do that? - Do what? - Make the cards dance. - What cards? - I'm afraid you're too smart for me. Could you roll up your sleeves? 1:15. What are they doing? The season begins on the islands when the wind carries everything away. And as if by chance, I've never been more pressed. Come on Lemmy, make up your mind! I was right to share my whisky with the geranium. Down there: Willy's friend tricked me. You could say they've all tricked me. I've never felt so alone. Thank you, Dora. I'll leave you the villa while I look around. If they're here, they work quietly. So. Everyone's gone, but where? I don't like this at all. I've more than one thing to do before I sleep. That ladder wasn't here before. Courage, Lemmy! Thanks, Lemmy. I'll need it. The boys did good work: Solid, nothing more. Only now they're gone the moment the bill appears. You'll have to pay in cash. Count on me, Dora. I'll make sure they all pay their share. They've left some nice holes! Lemmy? Hey Lemmy! Don't shoot Lemmy, it's Willy! Those bastards! They killed Dora. - Yes, I saw. At the last moment the car wouldn't start. Dora was prepared to die. Could I abandon my sister? - Did they leave? - I don't know. I heard cars. - Are you scared? - Shut up! For me it's emotion. You've got baggage? Dora wanted me to take it. - What are they up to? - It's only a gust of wind. The boss is crazy! Wait for Lemmy, shoot him, it's not so easy. And now I've got a cramp! I think I've seen enough of it. No fast ones, that's enough, no fast ones! Oh, shit! There, there's others! He's got others with him! Hello? Hotel Poule D'Or? I'd like to speak to Mlle Suzanne. She was away in the country this afternoon. Yes, I know it's late. So what? Suzanne, that's her first name. There's no one there? Thanks anyway. Even Suzanne. It's the night of the missed rendezvous. Everyone is gone and I've lost Miranda. Dora was right. I'm the Prime Minister of the King of Fools. I'm even the King. Sweet dreams, Your Majesty. In a minute you're gonna start sobbing. How come you've never talked about a friend? Somebody nice you dine with. Someone like... I don't know. Someone who likes you a lot. I have some good friends. With at least a million dollars in the bank in London or in Verdun? And here, you know it's finished. Either you get the money or something terrible happens. That would make for some nice memories. So are you going to write? If you keep it up, there will only be bits and pieces left. And your father can pick them up. You can make yourself sick as you please. I'll leave you until the 50th hour to think it over. Because on our next visit I'll bring you a mirror. And what I take can be easily dropped in the mail. Understand? Where is it you lost him? Where? I didn't lose him, boss... He slipped by me in the hall or the bedroom. Or in the living room? Definitely near a door at the moment I left. Yeah, just when it counted! I couldn't see anything. I was downstairs with Charlie. Shut up, you! The two of you would make a good pair of cadavers. I don't know what keeps me from strangling you, and right now! I can't do anything with the brat, I tell you that... - So what! Oh? Is it still about the satchel? Yes, it's about the satchel! My satchel! - So what? Will you go in mourning over it? - Yes, I will! A little. For years, I managed to stay out of sight. Always anonymous, always in the shadows. And now it's there, the big prize, so close, and... Almost the whole package. But thanks to this bum... So it was Lemmy who came? It's possible, boss. I was with Charlie at the window on the ground floor. Did you see Lemmy! Leave him alone, it doesn't matter. I'm sure it was him. I was right about him all along! - You realise that... - Shut it! And you too. And if it was him... The shit will fall on Pont Royale, where it's going to rain torrents. You said it. Take the car. Go get changed. Once you're in the water, what can you do but swim? And we will! Keep an eye on her. Hello, Pont Royale Hotel? Mr. Mulligan, please. Hello, Lemmy? Yes... The barbie doll tells you to get... Hello, Lemmy? Ignore her. You don't know women, they're very emotional creatures! And now let's talk seriously. First off, how are you doing, old man? Fine. I was waiting for your call. Did your boy get home all right? Yes, yes. Give him my compliments. He runs like a gazelle. Constance would like to see you. Me? I'd like nothing better than to speak with her. With pleasure. Tell her to be here... at a quarter to 10. She can share my breakfast. My morning meal. Downstairs in the lobby. All right...she's coming. And how is our dear Miranda? Perfect. See you soon! Hello? Connect me to Victor Hugo 9200. It's urgent. Yes. Hello, Police Headquarters? American tourist here. You know Lemmy Caution? He comes to the Pont Royale Hotel under the name "Mulligan". Mulligan! He will come at 10. 10 sharp! Thanks! Well, Constance? If you'd listened to me, you'd be up there singing to the ladies. Impossible, I sing off-key. Milk? No, I didn't come for a cup of tea. Now listen. I came here to say... No, you listen! You've got Miranda. I've got the satchel. So share and share alike. I get 50% of Miranda's price... And you get Suzanne for free. Deal? That's it? Is that all you want? Don't insist, or you'll tempt me. - No. With what I've got in hand... I could demand Miranda in the flesh and make any deals myself. So go to Siegella... and ask him to keep her for me. Now get going, the clock's ticking. And I don't like to wait! Interview over. And it's not worth it to get everyone excited over the satchel... If you think it's no longer in my room. If you only knew what I wanted... Full of holes like a piece of lace! If only you'd bury me...there! I'd like to speak with Mr. Mulligan. No, he isn't in his room. Oh, Mr. Mulligan! Police! Through there! Don't even try! Come on, no funny business. Bring him in. I believe I've been putting in overtime. Director, I'm pleased to introduce my friend Lemmy Caution... Special Federal Agent of the US Government. This is M. Chotard, Director of the Police Judiciary. - I've heard a lot about you. - Same here, Director! I'm sorry... Take those off. You see? He's the one who gave the alert of a gangster entering the country to do business with an international crime ring. Incredible trafficking: Kidnapping. Blackmail. White slavery. Armed robbery. The works. Their boss? Freddie Siegella. How's he doing? Very well. I just phoned him. Very good. Sit down. I'm sorry to have put you through so much trouble, but I had to make contact with you. In my hotel room I have a satchel that without question contains information harmful to Siegella. Documents with figures. Let him take care of it. You'll find the satchel under my pillow. Siegella thinks it's no longer in my room, so...be careful. Don't worry. We may not use American methods, but we do know a thing or two. And what about McPhee? How's your friend McPhee? - Dead. - Oh no! - Yes. I came too late. Director... You'll find near Rambouillet at the villa, Mares Artisses... A hunting scene. You'll see what I mean. - Completely. - And now I'll reveal the plan that I designed. AMERICAN GANGSTER ARRESTED He's still claiming he's an insurance officer. Only a muscular would be stupid enough to walk into such a trap. If I'd stayed at the villa like I wanted, he'd never have been arrested. They were waiting for him. Only time will tell. It's the fifth time you've said that. It's obvious with the fix he's in he'll say nothing. After all, it's about the satchel, all will be well. We're protected. In my opinion... In my opinion, we must settle accounts before extradition. It would be best to help him. And how. In England, they settle things and set caution(bail). What? - Caution on "Caution"! - In France it's more difficult. - In France, it's more crummy. - Yes. Should we get a lawyer? A proper one. Because once he's out... He knows what my satchel is worth and will make the most of it. This time he'll pay us back, count on it. Which do you prefer, an appeal to the heart or on my knees... Since it's no longer a question of the "muscular"? Exactly. She'll be coming out, what do you want to do? About her, we'll see. For now, you know it's better to go to Moulange's and wait it out. Okay. - I'll phone you later. - Fine. - You got what I asked for? - Of course. I can leave at any time? - For Tangiers at any moment. - Perfect! Everything settled in four shots, always a possibility in our business. And the two of us are quits. If I could get him in a corner, just for a minute. Only to say farewell. Yeah. Damn it! Yeah... Now. LEMMY CAUTION ESCAPES Hello? Yes? It's you. Read anything interesting lately? Not bad. Siegella is preparing your welcome at Moulange's. Yes, he knows his business. What? Yes, I know yes... You've got it? Good. Right away. - Some work, huh? - Oh, I know! Still it's nothing. A Peeping Tom masquerading as a stripper. T-24 here, T-24 here... Vehicle Star 6476 N-59... Has begun moving toward La Place du Trocadero. Hello, calling to TV-8: Vehicle Star 6476 N-59 just passed us, headed in the direction of the Port de Saint Clou. This is TV-13, TV-13... Vehicle Star 6476 N-59 passing the Port de Saint Clou. It is headed towards Versailles. This is TV-14, aboard a commercial van passing behind the Chateau of Versailles preceding the Star vehicle indicated... Calling TV-4, calling TV-4... I hear you. Star 6476 N-59 just passed us. Over TV-4, over TV-4... TV-94 here, TV-94 here. Awaiting passage of Star vehicle described. There it is. We are in pursuit, we are in pursuit. - Getting hot? - A little. TV-27 here, TV-27 here. I hear you. Still awaiting Star 6476 N-59 at crossing indicated. Attention TV-27, TV-27: Star vehicle lost. Return to Paris. All right. We're turning around! And hurry up, he's in danger! Is it understood? No whims, no craziness, no wild stuff. No one budges until Johnny returns from getting the repairs done. With 4 hotheads you can get sunk with together-together-not together. And try to step on it. Especially Maurice! How often do we have to make excuses for you? Attention... They're here. I like you better that way. You intimidate me. In other words: Hats off to you! That was a funny business with the cops. Oh, you know... Next to a guy like you, they aren't so sharp, the cops. So do we end the scene, wipe the slate clean, return to zero? Zero? Not completely. Constance said that I need to settle, it's urgent. We share too many memories to just let it drop, trust me. Bring Miranda here. The child has put up nothing but resistance. Perhaps you with all your charm... You'd be doing us a favor if you got her to listen. I'd be delighted. Then come on. She's upstairs. Working hard, eh? That's a hell of a job, eating yourself up! Relax! It's all there. - Here comes the cavalry! - Going well? It's going well, I can tell you, cutting off all the electricity! She's like this all the time. You can imagine how I'd love to... - You don't scare me, you two-faced witch! - Clam it! Ladies, ladies! Keep your heads and show some class. Oh, women! Don't you believe in your brave John Mulligan anymore? I was very stupid, wasn't I? So much the worse for me. Oh stop, I'll start crying! Isn't it amazing how she never shuts up? If Daddy heard you. It's nice here... Plus it's quiet. TV-27 here. Requesting a rebroadcast of instructions... Faced with two possible directions. Awaiting instructions. TV-27, TV-27... Pursue vehicle in direction given, continue to patrol. TV-94 here. In pursuit on Departmental Highway 161. Still searching for Star vehicle indicated. I'd give a fortune to be in retirement. They're expecting a beast, that's for certain. They'll perhaps look for information on my rather sensational escape. If they learn I possess a federal agent's badge, then I've every chance of facing my final scene. I'll profit from the life of the hunted. How I'd love to see myself among 22 cops. Ah, perhaps! Traitor! Say your prayers! Johnny! Lemmy's a rat! You rat, you dirty fink! The fink is a cop! And I'll get you all! Keep talking officer... you make me sick with your tin badge. I'll shoot it full of holes! Get him! Bring him to me alive! Here! Here! Stop! So...Mr. Federal Agent! Look at you now. Lemmy, I told you I'm very smart! Very! Pick up the baggage and haul it upstairs! Take a good look at him. This cop's death will enthrall the countryside. Get her dressed. We're leaving in 10 minutes. If you don't mind, I've something to say to you. Like the husband said... About his old flames and their pictures... "I won't be needing them anymore." I hate evidence! Now...This will warm things up! It will make you good and toasty! Relax! Take it easy... Think on other things! Farewell, copper... Sorry to have to break things off. I've no rum, no cigarettes... But I can offer you a light! - Lemmy? - Yes, boss? Music! Hello! Are you surprised? Siegella! Don't move! Siegella! I swear, you're unkillable. I'll get him all the same! He was asking for it! Maurice! Mamile! Louder! He's already around the corner, already gone! Relax! Take it easy! Think on other things. Hey, it's falling in, up there! Allow me? Thank you. We were so worried about you. You've got a delivery. Oh, yes. Come along, you wet hen. See you later, Lemmy. Oh, you were terrific! What are you doing tonight? - Me? Nothing. Then let's go out. Women are dangerous! subs by ironhills
