(Insects chirring) - Shh! - Police, get out of the car! - No! - Get out of the car! - No, Ben! No! - Let him go, ma'am. - No, Ben! No! (Screaming) (Breathing heavily) (Birds chirping) - Good morning. - Hey! You scared me! You want coffee? - Uh, sure. You up in the night again? - Oh yeah. I just couldn't sleep. Wow! You excited for your favorite day of the week? (Chuckling) - You making fun of me? - Mm-mmm. - 'Cause the weekend paper, it's a tradition. You get your coffee, and... or tea, and you relax and you do the crossword. - I cannot say I've ever done that. (Sighing) - Well, it could be tradition in our house. I'm gonna fix a few things up today. Wash the windows. - You know, Ben, you really don't need to keep bothering with this place. - Well, you said to treat it like a home, so I am. - OK! Well, I have to go into the office today, so you're on your own, but I'll be home by dinner. - OK, see you later! - Bye! (Door opening) (Door closing) (Slurping) (Footsteps approaching) - Hey! - Hey! - How's it going? - It's good. Actually, I wanted to show you what I had in mind for the back laneway. So I was thinking we could go below grade for parking in the front, and then do guest houses in the back. What do you think? - I think it's more incentive for people to buy, so, yeah, it's brilliant. - Except we need to redesign almost the whole complex for the new garage. Do we have time? - We should, yeah. Why don't I get started on that and you keep working on the guest houses. - Great! - OK. You know, I think being assigned to work together was a good idea. (Sniffling) - (Whispering): "A man's home is his..." - (Ben): God, that makes me want to do that. (Girl laughing) - (Girl): I like to use that one a lot. - Really? - And I use the line face. - Why that one? That's terrifying. - Um, 'cause I think it's funny. - OK, well... - And this one. - Yeah, well, what is that? Is that a... Is it smiling or is it frowning? Isn't it a little... You can tell he's got some issues. (Girl laughing) - So, it's kind of, like, confused or mad is one I use a lot. - Mm-hmm. Well, these... I mean, that's totally different things. That's... - Hey! What are you guys doing? - I'm explaining all the different emojis. - Oh. - I'm so confused. - Then just stick to the smiley face, and you'll be fine. Actually, I put one at the end of almost all my texts. So even if I seem sad or angry, people don't think I'm totally upset. - Hey, is this dinner? - Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I lost track of time. I was fixing that crack in the drywall. - Great! - You know, I'm thinking about going vegan, so if it's OK, I'll just make a salad later. - Of course, kiddo! - Hey! Just make sure you eat! - So, how was work? - Oh, uh, it was good! Yeah, um, I made a pretty big change to the town homes, which is sort of stressful, but, uh, I think it's... I think it's gonna work out great. - You know, when we were living in our car, and we got evicted, my mom would always say that: "It's not the type of roof over your head "that makes a home. A home is where your family is." - Ben... You know, I've been having second thoughts. And you've given me my space, but, um, I shouldn't want this much space from you. I shouldn't feel like we're just co-existing under the same roof. Do you get that? - Uh... I mean, I don't, actually. Because when I moved in here, I... I knew that that's what I wanted. - I know, and it's... it's what I thought I wanted too. But now I think it just all moved too fast. - Uh, Mel, I'm just, um, I'm having a hard time understanding this. I just... I don't see it. Uh, we... we don't argue. - Mm-hmm. - We talk things through. I get along great with Brook. - Yes, and... and I think we could always get along, but I don't want to just get along. - I mean, is it... Uh, am I overstepping? Is it... Am I neglecting you in... in any way? Because if I am, I will fix it. - I... - I'll fix it. - I don't think anything will fix it. But to me, the only way to find out is... Is if we go our separate ways, which I know is unfair, because you're the one who has to leave. (Chuckling) - So, there's nothing that I can say or do to change your mind? - Mm-hmm. And I'm really sorry. - Mm-hmm. (Sighing) - Look, I'm just gonna go and see if Brook will eat some of this food. (Exhaling sharply) - Good morning, Philadelphia! Aaron and the crew here with the weather and highway report to get you going on your daily commute. Let's start with the roads, which are looking pretty good right now, with a stalled vehicle... (Announcer talking, indistinct) The rest of the major routes only dealing with the usual congestion. - Smoke detector's fixed. - Thanks. Do I owe you or... - Uh, don't worry about it. The landlord will settle that. (Inhaling deeply) OK, have a good day. - Thanks again! - No problem! (Phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey. Uh, I just wanted to call and... and check in and let you know I'm all settled in. - That's great! - Yeah, it is, actually. It's... it's pretty homey. Uh, I won't keep you. Uh, I left my key in the mailbox. - I really appreciate it, Ben. And if you need anything from the house, like the coffee maker... I never use it, so you're welcome to have it. Or anything like that. - No, it's... it's OK. Everything there belongs in the house. But thank you. Good luck with everything. - You too. - Bad news. - What? - Halten bumped the development date. They want everyone's proposals in by the end of the month. - Great. And I had to go mess with the plan. - Hey, hey. I love your plan. And we will get it done. And when we do, we'll impress the crap out of them so that the next project we have will be picking out paint for our new offices. (Chuckling) - I like the way you think. - Ditto. (Clears throat) - (Woman): Brook's still not talking to you? - Barely. And I've tried explaining to her that I just rushed into things, which you'd think she would get, considering how moon-eyed she is over this Dylan kid, but no. All I get is just, like, an excessive amount of eye rolling. At least Ben's being very mature about it all. - Oh. So, no regrets? - I don't think so. 'Cause when Sam put his hand on my shoulder today, I felt like... I don't know, like, how I haven't felt with Ben in a while, so... - So, this Sam... - Mm-hmm. - He's single, right? - He is separated. - That counts. - It doesn't matter. Because I'm not getting involved with anyone, especially not from work. - Why not? - I can't. - It would make your tea breaks more exciting. (Laughing) - I'm so boring. - Look, all I'm saying is it doesn't have to be serious. Just think about it. You married the first guy you slept with. And then you moved in with the first guy you met after he died. - Yeah. - So, don't you think it's time to just... have a little fun? (Phone chiming) (Alarm ringing) (Phone buzzing) (Dog barking in distance) (Sighing) (Groaning) (Sniffling) (Groaning) (Sniffling) - Hey, no earbuds! You have to talk to me. - Fine. - Please. Otherwise, I feel like a very sad chauffeur. - I'll talk to you, Mom. - Thank you. - Morning! - Hey, Carl! - Morning, Carl! - Heading out for your day? - Yeah, just the usual: work and school. - Where's Ben? I haven't seen him all week. - My mom kicked him out. - Brook! - Yeah, Ben's no longer living with us, Carl. - Oh, that's a shame. - Yeah, I know. So, I'm gonna need you to keep an eye on things for me now. - OK, Melanie. You know you can always count on me. - Thank you, Carl. Have a good one! - All right. (Engine starting) (Sniffling) (Keys rattling) (Lock clicking) (Talking, indistinct) (Giggling) - Did he see us? - Uh, I don't think so. (Giggling) - He's sweet, but nosy. So if he saw me home early from school, he'd for sure tell my mom. (Chuckling) - It's a nice place! - You want something to drink? - Oh no, I don't want to waste any time. (Giggling) Oh. Mmm. (Giggling) (Giggling) Mmm! (Floor creaking) - What was that? - Hey, come on! It's nothing. Hmm? - Mmm. I gotta go check. (Alarm blaring) (Gasping) Seriously? Oh! - That is so loud! - Ah! Ah! - Uh... (Laughing) - Oh! (Knocking on door) Oh! - Hey, hey! Just ignore it! Come on, huh? - No, he's got a key. Go, go! I'll follow you. - OK, hey! (Keys rattling) - Hey, Carl! - Everything all right? - Yeah, sorry. The alarm battery must be almost dead. Don't worry. I'll replace it. (Insects chirring) - (Melanie): I mean, is this something new, huh? Skipping school? Or has this been going on for a while? - Of course not! - And I'm supposed to believe you? Because if Carl hadn't said anything, I wouldn't know, would I? - Give me a break! I'm telling the truth, OK? - Do not give me attitude, Brook. You're the one lying and skipping school. Is this because of Ben? Because I made a mistake! - I'm used to all the empty space, so whatever. - You know what? I'm sorry. I am. I honestly didn't think how much it would affect you, and I shouldn't have asked him to move in so quickly. - I am so not doing this right now! - Brook! Hey, we need to talk about this! Brook! (Sighing) (Phone chiming) (Chuckling softly) (Sighing) (Thunder rumbling) (Thudding) (Gasping) (Sniffling) (Banging) - What are you doing? - I think there might be squirrels or some animal getting up into the attic. - Gross. Also, who cares? No one goes up there. - Yeah, except all your toys are still up there: your trophies, your dollhouse. You used to love it up there. - Yeah, when I was a kid. - Brook... (Phone buzzing) - Hey! You've reached Ben's phone. Leave a message at the beep. (Voicemail beeping) - Hey! It's, uh, Mel. I'm sorry to bother you, but, I was wondering, did we ever have any issues with animals getting into the attic? I thought I heard some noises up there. But, anyway, uh, call me when you can. All right. Bye! (Sighing) (♪ Pop playing in restaurant ♪) - (Sam): This was great. - Yeah. - Worked on a lot of good ideas for the project. Had a bit of fun. I hope? - Yeah, for sure. (Phone ringing) You can get that. - No, no. It's OK. It's... (Inhaling deeply) It's my ex. I can call her tomorrow. - So, you're divorced? (Clears throat) - Separated. We haven't gotten that far, yet. - Sure. (Phone ringing) Sorry. My turn. It might be Brook. She's out tonight, so... - I get it, yeah. - It's, uh, it's nothing, actually. (Phone ringing) - Doesn't seem like nothing. - Um... I'm sorry. Just give me a minute. - Of course! - Hey! What's up? - Hey! Uh, I just forgot to leave a message, so I... I wanted to call you and say that I could come by tonight and look at the attic. - No, no. It's OK, Ben. Um, I shouldn't have bothered you. - You can just think of me like that handyman you met doing a job. I could... I could be by in 30 minutes. - You know, actually, I'm not home right now, but, really, I'm good. Thank you for getting back to me, though. Have a good night. (Line beeping) - Brook? Brook, are you home? (Grunting, breathing heavily) (Phone ringing) Hey! Where are you? Mm-hmm. Sounds like there's a party going on. No, Brook, this was not a part of the plan, and you know I don't like last-minute changes. So I will see you at home in an hour in time for curfew, OK? OK, bye. (Sighing) - This tenant, she's nonstop with the complaints. Good looking, but a whiner. Hey, did you hear? The whole building is going condo. You should grab a unit while they're still available. - I appreciate that, Vince, but I already have a home. And I never plan on leaving it. (Birds cawing) - Brook, before you go into your room, I just... I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. I get that Ben was a part of our lives for a while, so I promise to be more sensitive. Like leaving the photo on the fridge, 'cause those were good times, right? - It's fine, Mom. Really. I'm over it. - OK. What is this? Oh my goodness! - I'm sorry. I forgot it was your birthday. - It's OK, honestly. I wasn't... I wasn't even thinking about it myself. - Well, Ben didn't forget. - No, he didn't. - Hi! - Hey! What are you doing here? - Oh, I was showing a place over on Third, so I figured I would come over and bring you this. - Stop it! Stop it! - Happy belated. (Phone ringing in distance) - Oh my God, Erin! That's insane. - What? It's for Sam. - Yeah, I figured. - Is that him? - Yes. Please stop staring. - (Whispering): Oh my God! He's very cute. - (Whispering): I know. - So, how was your birthday? - Oh, it was interesting. It was interesting. Brook made my bed, left me a card. And, uh, Ben got me a brand-new pair of boxing gloves. - Cool. - Yeah. - Well, you can't blame a guy for trying. - No, it was very thoughtful. - And a little bit too late, because you're onto other things. - Yeah. I think I need to just keep my focus on Brook right now. She won't admit it, but she's been going up into the attic. So I hope it's giving her comfort and not... I just don't think it's a good idea to get involved with anyone right now. - I get it. And no one's saying you shouldn't take care of Brook. But just don't forget what you might need. - Yeah. - Oh, Ben! - Hey! - What... what are you doing here? - Uh, well, I guess I could ask you the same thing, Carl. - Well, um, Mel told me she had an electrical issue. I thought... thought I'd save her a few bucks. - Oh. - Uh... You know, I... I didn't even see your car pull up. - Oh yeah, it's, uh, it's in the shop. Yeah, look, it... it looks like you and I had the same idea, because, uh, between us, I came by to fix a few things in the house as well, as a... as a surprise to, I don't know, maybe patch up a few other things. - OK, I gotcha. - So, maybe we could keep this between us. And I... I will take a look at the electrical. I'll... I'll get that fixed. - Sure, um... Uh, Mel said it was in the den. - Mm-hmm. - Uh, just... just be sure to tell me how it goes. - Yeah, you bet. - So, how did you get in? - Oh, through, uh, through the back door. - Hmm. You know, I didn't even see you. And I... I don't miss much. - No, uh, no, you don't, Carl. - Tell Mel I'll, uh, check in on her later. (Gasping) (Breathing heavily) (Gasping) - Sorry, I... Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. - Ben. What are you doing here? - Brook called me. She's worried about you. Come on, let's go inside. It's fixed, but next time, call me right away. I didn't know that you were the one to, uh, find Scott after his stroke. - Yeah, I just don't like talking about it. - You know, I could, uh... If you're uncomfortable tonight, I could stay. - No. No, that's OK. That's really sweet. - OK. (Inhaling deeply) Well, I should get going. - Oh, I have something. This... - Oh, sorry. - No, it's fine. - Thought I got all the addresses changed. - No, it's... Thank you for coming by. - Yeah. Like I said, any time. Not just for the electrical. OK. - Bye. (Knocking on door) - Yeah. - Hey. You OK? - Yeah. Are you? - Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you for calling Ben. - I was worried you might get mad, but... Erin didn't answer her phone, so... - No, it's OK. Do you still talk to Ben? I mean, it would be OK if you did, as long as he doesn't make you uncomfortable by asking about me or... - No. No, I don't talk to him. I'm good, Mom. Really. - OK.

(Man talking on police radio, indistinct) - Mrs. Carver? - Yeah? - We've done a thorough search. There's no sign of forced entry. Is it possible someone else was home? No. My daughter's away on a field trip. It was just me. What about the back door? - It was locked from the inside. - OK. But the chair was tipped over. And, I mean, someone tore up that newspaper. - We understand, but... - No, you don't understand! Somebody was in my home. I've heard them. I've seen them. It's not just today. I've heard footsteps. When I came home the other night, I saw somebody standing at that window. - Mrs. Carver, other than the chair, your house and all of your valuables are undisturbed. - Please... I know I'm not crazy, and it's just me and my daughter here. - And we understand. And if something else occurs, call us. In the meantime, I suggest a security system. It'll make you both feel safer. (Man talking on police radio, indistinct) (Talking, indistinct) (Sighing) - What did IT say? - It's gone. - The whole file? - No, not all of it. I have some of the individual components saved on the office computer. But yeah, everything we did in the last week, it's gone. I have no idea what happened. - Could it have been your daughter? - Excuse me? My daughter, why would she do that? - Dammit, I don't know, OK? (Sighing) We were really on top of this one, Mel. We had it. - Yeah, I know. You don't have to remind me of that, Sam. - I was just hoping that this one would work out, really counting on it. And now it's... - No, I get it. I get it. I'll go talk to the developers. - No, no. Just try to find it, and I'll see if there's any way out of this mess. - OK. (Sighing) (Phone buzzing) - Hey. - Hey! I was just calling to see how you were doing. - Funny, because I was just about to call you and ask the same thing. - Actually, I'm having a pretty lousy day. Lousy week, really. - I'm sorry, Mel. Can I do anything? Can I, uh, lend an ear? (Inhaling deeply) - You know what? That would... that would be nice. - Great. Well, I mean, I'm available right now if... if you want to meet at that coffee shop you like or at the house. - You know, what about... What about your place? - At my place? - You could text me your address. I could meet you there in about an hour. - Hey! I forgot to mention they haven't added my name yet. Come in! - Wow! Yeah, you've really done a lot with it already. - Well, I mean, I've had a lot of time on my hands. (Chuckling softly) And to be honest, uh, it came partially furnished, so I can't take all the credit. Do you want something to drink? I got, uh, water or a tea. - Um, actually, I'd... I'd love a glass of wine if you have any. - Uh, wine... I don't know. Actually, I do have. Is white OK? - Yeah, great! - Uh, so, how come you're not at work? - Oh, uh, there's been a bit of a setback with the Halten contract, so... - Is everything all right? I know that was a big deal for you and your partner, uh... - Sam. - Sam, right. - Well, he's not very happy with me right now, so I thought it best if I just get out of there. What about you? What have you been up to? - Uh, you know, not much. The usual. Odd jobs here and there. - Thanks. - Yeah. - You already have so many books. - Oh, yeah. I picked 'em up at a garage sale. They were practically giving them away, so... Uh, I'm gonna get some water. You still good? - Oh, no, I don't need a top up yet. - OK. Ah. (Clears throat) Cheers! - Cheers. This kind of feels like when you were finishing up that first job at the house, and I offered you a drink... (Chuckling) after putting in the last window. - Yeah, it does. It does. - I'm sorry. - No, don't be. - Hey. - What? - Maybe you wanna show me your new bedroom? - Um... I'm such an idiot. I'm such a... (Sighing) I totally forgot that I have a... Yeah, I have a job starting in 30 minutes. - Oh. - Can we... can we meet at the house later? Would that be OK? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. - I'm sorry. - No. - OK. Ah, just stay right here. Hold on. - Sure. (Sighing) - (Ben): Hey! So, what time works for you later? 'Cause I don't think I'll be too late at this job. - This was a huge mistake. But I'm very happy to see you've moved on. - No. Hold on, hold on, wait. Hold on. - Yeah? - What are you... - What? - This... this isn't what it looks like. - Stop, Ben. - It's what you asked for. - Stop. I shouldn't have come. - Mel, what are you... Mel! (Door closing) - (Dylan): So, how did he die? - The cops said it was an accident, so at least he didn't die like my dad, or my mom might be more messed up. I mean, she's totally hearing things again. She even asked if I was hanging out in the attic. And I heard her say she called the cops, which is even more paranoid than before. It makes me not want to stay at Natalie's tonight, in case she, like, freaks out or something. - Hey! What are you guys doing? - Just hanging out. - Actually, I think I... I should go. I'll see you later. Bye, Mrs. Carver. - Bye, Dylan. So, you're doing OK? - Yeah. Why? - Oh, nothing. Just... Just wondering. So, you really haven't been going up into the attic? - No, Mom, I haven't. And honestly, I don't want to for the same reason you don't go up there. Because it would just feel weird. But, you know, maybe you should. Maybe you should go up there and see for yourself that it's just you and me here. That's all. (Inhaling deeply) - Brook... You can stay at Natalie's house tonight if you want. I'll be fine. - OK. (Phone chiming) (Insects chirring) (Car approaching) (Doorbell ringing) - Hey! Come on in. - (Sam): I, uh... I looked for you at the office, but you were gone. - Yeah, I just had some errands I had to take care of. - Uh... - Did you talk to the developers? - Yes. They were not impressed. But I managed to get a face to face. So if we cobble together everything we've got, I think we might be able to sell it. - That's good, then, right? - It is. Look, Mel, I'm so sorry. I know I kind of lost it there. - It's OK. I was just as upset about the whole thing. - No, I crossed a line. We should have handled it together. - We should have, which is why we need to just, like, move forward and get it done, 'cause honestly, I need to pull it together in every area of my life right now. (Sighing) (Grunting) (Sam coughing) Sam? (Sam coughing in distance) Sam? Hey! Sam, what is it? - I... - Sam? (Coughing, wheezing) Sam, hey! Look at me. Sam? - I... (Coughing, gagging) - Hey, Sam! Sam, come on. - 911. What's your emergency? - Uh, yeah, I need an ambulance. Sam? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I don't know! I don't know! Sam, I need help! Please, no, no, no, no. Hey! Hey, it's gonna be OK. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's gonna be OK. Hey, come on! Come on! Please send somebody, please! Please send somebody!

Sam, hey, what are you talking about? - Mrs. Carver. - Yeah, he was just talking, but he wasn't making any sense. - He's likely confused. It's common after poisoning. - Poisoning? No. We didn't eat anything, go anywhere. - We're still waiting on Toxicology for those answers. You said you didn't eat anything? What about fluids? - Mmm, just coffee, that's it. - We have had incidents where household cleaners were used and tainted the machines. - I don't use it. I don't drink coffee, so the last time I would have cleaned it... - It's OK. We'll get to the bottom of it. - OK. - The important thing is that his kidneys don't fail us and he gets through the next six hours. - OK... (Exhales sharply) (Floor creaking) (Gasping) Brook, stay in your room and call 911. - Why? - Just do it! - Mom! (Breathing heavily) Mom! Mom... (Breathing heavily) (Breathing heavily) I'm sorry! But we weren't doing anything. I was just freaked out! - Brook, I could have killed him! How many times has he been in the house without me knowing? - Just once, when I skipped school. - I don't believe you. - I'm telling the truth! - Somebody has been in the house, Brook! Was it him? - No, I swear! - Then who was it? - I don't know! (Exhaling slowly) Mom, you're scaring me. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (Sniffling) It's gonna be OK. (Breathing heavily) - How? How are things going to be OK? 'Cause they were for a bit when Ben was here. And now they're not again. So, what's got to change? - This. I mean, all of it. We both... we both feel how big the house is without Dad in it, so let's just move. It'll be a fresh start. Exactly what we both need. What do you think? - Yeah. Yeah, I want to do that. - OK, then we will. I'll call Erin tomorrow, and I'll have her list the house. And we'll find a new home, one with no bad memories. I promise. I love you, Brook. - I love you too. (Woman talking on PA, indistinct) - Thank you for setting this up so quickly. - I think what you're doing is a great idea. - Well, Brook already started packing, so... I don't know. I think it's the right move. - Here's the plan: I'll set up a time with the photographer to take pictures. In the meantime, check out those listings I sent you. There's one that needs renovation but I think you're gonna love it. - I'm excited! - Me too! It's gonna be so good for you. - Mmm. I love you. - I love you too. I'll call you later. - All right. Bye! (Engine starting) Hey! - Hey. (Inhaling deeply) You never returned my text, so I... - Right. Um, I meant to. There's just been kind of a lot going on. - It's OK. Yeah. I just, uh, I wanted to come by and say that that piece of lingerie you found in my couch, that is... - Yeah. - That's not what it looks like. - Ben, it's OK. It's fine. I shouldn't have come by anyway. - What? Why? Why not? What happened between us, that, I mean, that happened for a reason. - I know, but they weren't the right reasons. You know, what was right was the decision that both of us move on. - Mel, come on, I know the mistakes I've made, trust me. I've been paying attention. I have. - I see that. And the gestures have been very thoughtful. But what I need is to focus on Brook and I. - That I understand. You two should take some time and make this place home again, create new memories. - You know, actually, I've asked Erin to list the house. - Mel, um... I mean, I... I don't understand. This is your home, Mel. And how is just leaving it and... and uprooting Brook, how does that make it any better? - Well, she actually agrees that it's a good idea. And, you know, you're the one who always said that it's not about the kind of roof over your head, it's about family. So wherever we go, we're gonna make a new home. - Are you sure about that? - Excuse me? - Because my mom just made that up to make me feel better. You don't know how lucky you are to have a home until you don't. - I understand that, Ben. - No, you don't. You don't. Do you know how much I've invested into this house? Because when I got here, it was clearly neglected. - And I appreciate everything that you've done. - Do you? Because maybe if I was here, Carl would still be alive. Because I care about this house the way that it should be cared for. - OK, excuse me. I have some calls I need to make. - Hold on. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to show you how attentive I can be. - Ben, it's time we both move on. - I don't just pay attention to the house. I'm paying attention to you. - No. - Mel, please. Listen, listen... - Jesus. - I belong here. - Goodbye, Ben. - Mel, Mel. Do not shut me out. - Goodbye, Ben. - Don't shut me out. I have nowhere to go! Open it! Mel! Hey, Erin! Hey! - Ben! - Hey... - What can I do for you? - Uh, well, I was, uh, I was just down the street doing this job, and I wanted to see if you were home, because, well, uh, basically, my place, it's... it's going condo. And so, I'm... I'm thinking about buying something. I was hoping you had a minute to talk. - Um... Sure. Why don't we go inside? - Hey, thanks for coming so late. - No problem. - That leak in the basement is getting worse. - Can I help you? - No, I'm just visiting someone. - Actually, I live here. - I'm sorry? - This is my apartment. - Oh! So, you live with Ben? Ben Shields. - The maintenance guy? No, why? Did he say that... - Im sorry. How long have you lived here? - Four years. - Oh! (Breathing heavily) (Grunting) (Breathing heavily) (Gasping) Ben? - Hi. - Have you been staying up here? - I mean, you kicked me out. (Scoffing) What was I supposed to do? - Leave! Get your own place! Not stay in my attic! - Mel, I, uh, I got nowhere else to go. Do you know how that feels? - I don't care! This is my home, where I live with my daughter. And you crossed a line, because this is insane. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. Mel. Look, don't go. Do you know how many times I thought I had finally found a home, only to have my foster parents grow tired of me or the adoption agency relocate me? Do you know how many times that happened? - I think we should go downstairs. - Why? Hey, look at me. What is the rush? Are you gonna hurry up and... and sell the house? Is that what you're gonna do? A home should be cherished, Mel, not taken for granted. And that is what I vowed to do the day that I walked in here. Nobody is gonna take that from me again. - Mom? - Hey, kiddo! - Ben! What are you doing here? Uh, well, your mom and I had a conversation, and I'm back. I'm home again. - Where is she? - She went over to Erin's. What do you want for dinner? I was thinking about ordering something. - I'm not really hungry. - Vegan, right. Uh... - How come my mom's car is still here? - Well, she... she took an Uber. And, uh, her and Erin were gonna have a glass of wine, so... I thought I saw vegan on this menu. - I'm just gonna go do some homework. - OK! (Line ringing) (Phone ringing in distance) Yeah, I would like to order for home delivery, please. That's great. (Ben talking, indistinct) - Mom? - Mmm! Mmm! - Mom? Oh! - Hang on a second. Hey, Brook? Brook? - (Whispering): Answer him. - Yeah? - Do you like peppers? - Sure! - Yeah, we'll take peppers. - You have to get out of here. - No, I can't. - Please, Brook! Please! - I'm not leaving you. - OK. OK, get my feet. (Breathing heavily) - Look, let's talk about this. - Run! (Groaning) (Both grunting) (Grunting) (Grunting) - I'm never leaving. - This isn't your home! (Grunting) No! (Groaning, breathing heavily) - Ah! (Groaning) (Siren wailing in distance) (Dog barking in distance) (Man talking on police radio, indistinct) - It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK. - (Woman): Do we have eyes on him? - (Man): Negative. Unit 22, on our way. - Over. (Talking, indistinct) - So, what do you think? - I love it! - Yeah, Erin knew we would. - Can we move in now? - Well, the last of the renovations are almost done, so why not? - What about the attic? - There's no attic. Hey, go inside. Check out your new room. I'll be right behind you. Closed Captions: MELS
