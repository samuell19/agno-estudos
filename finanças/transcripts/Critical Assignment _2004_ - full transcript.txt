- Well, it seems certain that the militia will eventually gain the upper hand in these hostilities. - The Federal Militia have taken over the main road leading into town and are gradually pushing through barricades set up by. - Shows no sign of abating. Reporting from the frontline, this Ed Johnson, GSN. Come on, go! Get to the warehouse, take cover! Come on, come on. - You've got to move. - I've been hit. - There's a bomb. - Go, go, go! Get out of here! - The recipient has gone beyond the realms of journalism by showing that there is more to our sense of purpose than just getting the scoop. Ladies and gentlemen, fellow journalists, the Special Journalist of Merit Award goes to Africa's own Michael Power. Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. - You're welcome. Well-deserved. Thank you very much. Thank you. Most of us, not just journalists, everyone, we look but we do not see. We listen but we do not hear. We talk, wow, how we talk, but we do not always communicate. To communicate what is true, what is valuable, and right, to believe in that, that is the challenge we all share. I'm very proud to be a journalist. To be rewarded for it? Well, that's a wonderful and unexpected bonus. I thank you all so very much. - Yeah! Again, sir, thank you. - Laura and I were hoping you'd stick around long enough to come over for dinner. - I'd love to, but. - Another story. - Always. - You gonna tell me what? - Global water crisis, Time Magazine. - That's some story, huh? - Hm, you know half the world's populations affected by it. The other half ought to do something about it. - So where do you start? - Hm, a wonderful land, a place with a future. My own backyard, Africa. ♪ I've been away for so long that I wonder ♪ ♪ If the sound of the drums still has its power ♪ ♪ Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa ♪ ♪ I've been away for so long that I wonder ♪ ♪ Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa ♪ ♪ If the sound of the drums still has its power ♪ ♪ Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa ♪ Now, we come to the final matter on the agenda, the defense budget contract, worth a total of 500 million U.S. dollars. Minister for Defense, Honorable Patrick Lembe. Mr. President, after carefully assessing the tenders submitted, the most competitive are from the companies DeFactor and Arms Link. However, as I explained to Secretary Ojuka, I favor Arms Link due to their additional seven year post-sale service agreement. - I do endorse the view of the Minister. What a travesty. $500 million to spend on stockpiling arms and weapons of destruction, when 60 % of our population lacks clean water? I have with my own eyes seen the suffering of our people. The lack of basic amenities, such as drinking water, causing illness, death, and untold hardship. At any one time, half of our people are suffering from illnesses that come from a basic lack of clean water and proper sanitation. Minister, do you want to elaborate? - We simply haven't enough funds to meet their medical demands. - This is preventable. Do you realize that for every 10 armored tanks that we have, we can buy 50 bulldozers? Every fighter plane, we can lay 10,000 miles of pipework. And for all the thousands of rifles that we have, we can provide 10,000 water pumps. In the absence of any threat to this country's stability, I refuse to waste millions of dollars on arms. As of now, the defense budget is shelved. We will reallocate the funds towards the commissioning of the Water For All project. Ladies and gentlemen, we can fill our own glasses of water whenever we want. Let's not take that for granted, ever. Africa Airlines Flight 342 from Chicago has landed. - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. It is a great honor for me to address you this afternoon. My corporation, Rhinestone, is bringing you all together by making technology available that will bridge the gap between cultures, people, and languages. I'm launching my scheme, Log-On Africa, by trying to piece together. Michael. - How are you doing? - Great, how was Chicago? - It was good. Ed sends his love. - Awe. - I noticed Thomas Rhines has managed to slip quietly into the country. - Well, quietly doesn't get you ahead, now, does it? - The shortest distance between people. - Where's Jomo? - One guess. - Football. - Mm-hmm. - Listen, I'll catch ya later. - See ya, baby. - Will be the national primary school here in the capital. I've always loved Mother Africa. She's always given me so much pleasure. And, indeed, it feels good to give back. I often say that in my heart, I am an African in a European's skin. - Michael, you're back! Jomo, you're late. - Sorry, the match went into extra time. And you know what? - Hm? - It was still a draw. - Oh, come on. You're trying to tell me I had to stay here and listen to Thomas Rhines for the sake of a draw? - No, no, no, you had to stay here and listen to Thomas Rhines in expectation of victory, my friend. Think about tonight. You, me, and Anita, 6:00 o'clock. Okay? - Cool. ♪ Do you really want to throw away ♪ ♪ Oh, baby ♪ ♪ Do you really want to fight ♪ ♪ Are you sure you want to see it ♪ Oh, no. Welcome home. Surprise! - You and Jomo set this up? - Yeah. - You have no idea how much trouble you're in. - You didn't expect to get away without a celebration, did you? - Come on down here. - No, but did you guys ever stop and wonder what the hell you were doing when all these bullets were zipping around, huh? - Were bullets zipping around? - Yes. - You should've told me this. No, come on, seriously. The danger, you don't really feel it when you're in the middle of it. - Hey, Michael, you know I know the feeling. It's just like being an accountant. Please, Jomo. When our time is up, it's up. Accidents do happen. - And you never see them coming. - Madam Baka. I'm so pleased you're here. - Oh, Anita. - You know Jomo. - Nice to see you again, Madam. - How do you do? - Fine, Madam. - Guys, excuse us just a second, huh? - And how is my favorite prodigy? - I'm fine. I even brought you something back. - Chocolates? - This is for you. - Oh, no. Michael, I can't. You earned it. - I insist. - Anita, you know I sometimes worry that you guys, you don't come back. - We'll always come back. This is our home. - Yeah, I know it's our home. But, well, what if something happens to him, huh? Or you? - Michael knows what he's doing, huh? Let's celebrate that. - Cheers. - So how are things at the editor's desk? Hectic. The president's water project has caused quite a stir. And so your water story could become quite controversial. - That's what makes headlines. - It's uncanny. You are always in the right place at the right time. Good teacher. - You know, I have been inundated with emails and phone calls from all over the world. I even got a call from some stressed-out American demanding a meeting. - Benji! - Michael! Jump in. All right, have a seat. Okay, you get her this time. Uncle George. - Welcome home, Michael. - Thank you. - Oh, Michael. Oh, you haven't been eating. You've lost weight, again. Auntie Comfort, I eat all the time. Honestly. - No, no, no, no, no. You're way too thin. And you know I'm never happy if I can still get my arms around you. Welcome home. - Thank you, Auntie. - And how are you, today? - Chief Fodio. - Michael Power. - How are you, sir? - Welcome. - Thank you. - Welcome home. - Mr. Marshall? Mr. Marshall? Mr. Marshall? - Be good, Nunu. Children, don't forget to wash your hands. Nothing changes. - Cleanliness is next to godliness. - So it is, can we eat? - Let us own honor Comfort by eating well. - Thank you, Chief. This food is nice. - This is great, Aunt Comfort. Thank you, Michael. - Your work takes you further and further away these days, Michael. - I follow the stories. It's not often that they come to you. But you'll be glad to know that my present assignment starts here. - Here? - Right here. - Then you will be able to attend the village bazaar. - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Ah, good. No matter how long the turtle's head is out, it must go back inside its shell. Michael, the president's water thing, what does it mean? - Basically, the government will buy the equipment; pipelines, water pumps, whatever is needed. But the key thing is it is to be driven by the local communities. - At last. You know who fetches the water in the dry season? Us women and the children. - It brings back memories. - Oh, not good ones. Oh, who is that? He is eating with his family. - Excuse me, please. - I want one of those. - Anita! What? The doctor said she's in a deep coma. And the American guy is dead. - Michael, what on earth was Madam Baka working on? I don't know. But I'm going to find out. - Mr. Jon Marshall, 33 years old, a single bullet wound to the forehead from a .22 caliber gun. Free entry wound to the front indicates that gun was fired at pointblank range. Professional hit, I'd say. He's lived in Africa for several years. - You can tell that from his body? - No, from his entry visa status. A lot of air miles there. Do you know if this is all there was? That's all there is. Secretary Ojuka? - This is a government restricted area. - Michael Power, African News Bureau, I'm expected. Thank you very much. - Mr. Power, this way please. - Thank you very much. - Oh, excuse me, I didn't realize anyone was here. - I'm here to see Secretary Ojuka. I'm Michael Power. - Oh, the journalist. - Yes. - Well, it's good to finally put a face to such a renown name. I'm Sabina Siko. - Sabina. Sabina means princess, doesn't it? - No, that's Sabrina. I'm Secretary Ojuka's intern. He should be down shortly. Please, make yourself comfortable. Thank you. - I've read some of your articles. - Only some? - Well, between work here and my post-graduate studies, I hardly have enough. - Time. - Exactly. - Mr. Power. I am sorry for keeping you waiting, but I can see that Sabina has kept you entertained. Sabina, are you sitting in on this? - No, Uncle, I have a lecture to attend, but I'll be seeing you later. - Goodbye, Mr. Power. - Pleasure meeting you. - Oh, congratulations on your prestigious award. - Thank you. - When a son of our soil receives such a thing, it sends a positive message about our country and it wasn't lost on the president either. But that is not why you're here. - No, I'm here regarding the Jon Marshall murder story. - Oh, the matter of an expatriate? It's not good for tourist trade and we all know how important the foreign exchange is to the country. - Yes. I was wondering, Secretary Ojuka, how well did you know Jon Marshall? - Forgive me for saying, but you sound more like a detective than a journalist. - My apologies. It's just that one of your business cards was found among Jon Marshall's personal effects. - I see. But then, I am a politician. I meet different people all the time. It wouldn't be unusual for my business card to get in the hands of relative strangers. Huh? More importantly, how is Madam Baka? - Unfortunately, she's still in a coma. - Oh, sorry to hear that. My thoughts are with her. - Mr. Secretary, your next appointment, Mr. Willem Le Trois, has just arrived. - Thank you. If that is all, I do have another pressing engagement. - I thank you for seeing me on such short notice. - You're welcome. Mr. Power. This administration fully supports the freedom of the press. Maybe these matters are best left in the hands of the police. They investigate the crime and you write the story. - In my experience, sir, sometimes the story solves the crime. Good day. I know, I know, I can see him. I'm afraid you wasted your time coming here. - An American citizen's been murdered and you're not concerned? - I've already been through this with the local police. I'd be more concerned if Marshall was one of ours. Fortunately, he wasn't. We've run his photo and his prints through our system and came up with nothing. Marshall was not an American. - But he had an American passport. - Correction, he had a fake American passport. As far as we're concerned, he doesn't exist. He's someone else's problem. - I'm sure he was stonewalling me. I need your help here, Ed. - Michael, you got a dead body and a business card. What do you want me to do? Call the Marines? - Look, when the U.S. Vice Consul tells me someone doesn't exist, you can be sure of one thing, they exist. Madam Baka wasn't just my editor-in-chief. She was my mentor. - All right, I'll see what I can do. How's your water story? Under pressure. - All right, I'll get back to you. Look, come on, guys. Look, we can't blame everything on an African politician. - Oh, come on. - Okay, no. But some of them do, some don't. - Not the-- - Well, look. Take Ojuka, for instance. - I'm not so sure. I took a photograph of him during the primaries and let me tell you, some over zealous intern faxed me a letter accusing me of photographing him in a bad light. - Ah, Anita, come on. Look, Ojuka's done a lot of good for this country, okay? Look, like getting the National Youth's Soccer Sponsorship to compete in the Junior World Cup. - That's true. - So he's okay in my book. - Anybody interested in football is okay in your books. - And, besides, is there a good light in which to photograph politicians? Mm-hmm. - Same again, guys, yeah? - No, thanks, I'm driving. - We're flying in the morning. I'll catch you later. - See you later. Oh, and Anita, soccer is the thing 'cause soccer is the king, okay? Hey, hey! Hey! - Careful, Michael! - They didn't even take anything. My laptop computer, TV, video, stereo, it's all here. - What have we here? City brothers and their big flying machines. - Hey, Mojadji, Michael Power. - Nice to have you here, Michael. - This is my photographer, Anita Chiama. - Anita. - Mr. Mojadji. It's a pleasure to meet you. How are things? - This is what I was telling you about. We'll head right over here. Do you see the scale of what I'm dealing with here, Michael? This village is not unique at all. In fact, the problem isn't even isolated to Africa. It's a tragedy that's being repeated all over the world. Diseases endemic, you name it, malaria, diarrhea, dengue fever, hookworm, and they all originate from what? Unclean water. This is Coco Stream, the villages nearest water supply. Only the water here is a cesspool of disease. I wouldn't let wildlife drink it, let alone human beings. - Hello. - Good morning, ma'am. - Hello, how are you? How long has it been like this? - Too long, and it just keeps getting worse over the years. But this is their homeland. This is the hard life they have become used to. Did you know every eight seconds, somewhere in the world, a child like this dies from a water-related disease? Shh-shh, hey. - How do you feel? - What? - How does it feel holding her? She's only four years old. - There aren't words. - It's not much farther now. It took me more than a year to discover this place. Come on. Here it is. Enough clean water to cater for communities within a 50 mile radius. Oof. How long has this been under construction? - About five months. We're planning to redirect a substantial amount of the spring water through pipelines nearer to the villages. - And that must be what, 10 miles? - Oh, about that. You know, we obviously don't have enough funds to make it all the way, but we'll take it as far as our small funds can do it. Every mile we achieve is one less mile for the people around here to walk. If we can save one life, we can save a generation. ♪ Give out the water ♪ ♪ Spread out the water ♪ ♪ Give out the water ♪ ♪ Spread out the water ♪ It's beautiful here, Harry. - Peaceful, too. And despite the hardship, there's a strong sense of community. - Do you miss the city life at all? Like a fish misses dry land. Years back, I used to be an engineer with the Ministry of Works and Housing in the capital. I couldn't get one damn thing done in that place. But at least here, I feel I can make a contribution. This article you're writing, will it really make a difference? - Well, the timing is right. The president is launching his Water For All project and it is an international issue. So I really do believe the story will make a difference. - Well, I hope you're right. - All right, Kel, see you tomorrow. Okay, cheers, take care, bye. - You know when you concentrate, your tongue sticks out just between your lips. - Hey, are you spying on me? - No, I graduated here. - Oh, really? - I've got a soft spot for the gym. - Um, any of your old teachers still around? - One or two. My old English teacher's about to retire. She's finally given up on trying to mark my articles. Listen, can I buy you a drink? - Yeah, sure. Anyway, it's a habit. I had it since I was a kid. - What is? - My tongue. Your articles are oddly optimistic. It's inspiring. Most journalists are cynical, like they've seen it all before. - Just because you've seen it all before doesn't mean things can't change. If I didn't believe things could change, I wouldn't write. It's about belief and believing. People forget it's a verb, you know? It's something you do. But imagine if we all did it, believed. - Well, the world would be a better place and there'd be no need for journalists. - I think I could cope with that. - Really? Hm, then why do you write? - I graduated here, went to America. - Harvard I imagine. - You can tell? - Mm-hmm. - Anyway, I used to write home to my mother and father from America before they died in the drought. Sometimes I think I write as though I'm still writing home. The articles, well, they're just letters that happen to be published for everyone to see. And you, why an intern? Sure. Well, Secretary Ojuka was a really close friend of my parents. They died too in a car crash. I'm sorry. - And he took me in, raised me as his own daughter. He even sponsored my studies overseas. I'm only working as his intern until I finish my post-graduate studies. - Looks like we have a lot in common. And so after you graduate? - I'm hoping to join the Foreign Service and if everything goes my way, I'll get a post with our embassy in London. - Look, I know you're very busy, but do you ever have an evening free? - You mean for a date? - You look stunning. - Oh, thank you. - Have yourself a wonderful evening. - Great, and don't work too hard. - Oh, not at all. - Okay. - Good evening. Bye, Uncle. - Michael, are you okay, are you hurt? Talk to me, my brother! Jomo, stop shouting in my ear. It's just my shoulder, that's it. - You've been hit. - It's nothing! It's just glass. - Michael! Michael, are you okay? - I'm fine. - No, he's not fine, somebody tried to kill him. Michael, that's enough, I'm calling the police. - No, Jomo. - Look, Michael. We need to get you to the hospital. You're bleeding. - No. I can take care of it, okay? I'm okay, really. We're gonna do whatever we can, Mr. Power. - Thanks very much, officers. Take care sir. - I'm lucky they were bad shots. Some first date, huh? Sorry. - Anita. - I heard what happened. - Sabina, meet Anita Chiama. A photographer friend of mine. This is Sabina Siko. She works in Secretary Ojuka's office. - Hi. - Hello. - A drink, anyone? - No, I'm still busy. If you're fine, fine. You can come and check out the photos when you're ready. Nice meeting you. - You too. I'm sorry about that. We get it right next time, huh? Can I call you? - Hm, do that. Look, I'm sorry if Anita felt a little like. - She gets overprotective. - And? - And she's a dear friend and my photographer, that's it. Okay. Talk to you soon, then. - Okay. - Bye. - Hi. I'm sure spending too much time in this red light makes you crazy. - So you're seeing Sabina, now? We're just friends. What? - You could have told me. - Tell you what? - Don't get me wrong. I'm very happy for you. But if you're falling for her when people are clearly trying to kill you, well, we don't want you losing concentration, do we? - There's nothing to tell. - Your new friend, she's the one who sent me the fax, Michael. You know what that is. That is manipulation of the press. I almost got fired. So is kissing you, that's manipulation of the press. - Anita, don't shoot the messenger. She was probably just following instructions. With the fax, I mean. Obviously. - Obviously. The number of times I've complained to editors about the photos they select. - Let me see that one. Are these the photos you took at the airport? - Yes. - I know who that is. That's Jon Marshall. Sorry, sir, you have a visitor. - Mr. Power, it's a great pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. - You write inspiring articles. When my Log-On Africa project is officially launched, I hope you'll cover it. - It's in my diary. - What's your handicap? - That I've never played. - Oh, you should, my friend. All the best deals are done on the golf course. You know if you get your swing right, you use every muscle in your body. So I understand Jon Marshall worked for you. - He was a consultant on African business affairs. - Was he with you long? - On and off. If it's important, you can get the office to give you the exact dates. - I spoke to the U.S. Embassy and they have no record of a Jon Marshall ever existing. - Really? - Yes. Extraordinary. Well, whoever he was, he had a wealth of experience in Africa, which is why we hired him. It's all in the grip. - Oh, yes, of course. What sort of person was he? Michael, do you know what a consultant does? Basically, they borrow your watch and tell you the time. - But the fact still remains that a member of your staff has been murdered. - You can't write that, Michael. It's inaccurate. - Was that a good swing? - Perfect. At the time of Marshall's death, his contract had expired. - That's strange. This is a picture of him with you at the airport last week. He was there, but he wasn't with me. - Didn't he talk to you? - I was busy dealing with a more important matter, like my Log-On Africa project. - Oh, right. - I mean, you don't have to mention my project in any of your articles. - Of course, I wouldn't. - But if you do, it's L-O-G, dash-- - I'm there, Mr. Rhines. Every muscle in your body you say, huh? Madam Baka. - Oh, they're lovely, Michael. Thank you. - Shh. Hello. You're where? Halfway around the world for a few days? - Yeah. - Come on, man. - Gimme a break. I got a call from Anita. - Look, I'm fine. - Yeah. Yeah, right. Your guy, Jon Marshall, gets killed. Your editor gets put in a coma. You, you get shot at. All in the space of one week? - And? - And you're fine? You got shot at, Michael. - Well, I must be doing something right. - Yeah, that's why I'm here. Jon Marshall's passport is the real McCoy. It had a secret code number. It's standard issued to deep-cover agents. These guys, Michael, they live and breathe in the shadows. He was under the radar. - So when things go wrong, nobody holds up their hand. - Yeah. - What I do know for sure is that Jon Marshall definitely worked as a consultant for the Rhinestone Corporation. - Rhinestone as in Thomas Rhines, the millionaire philanthropist? Apart from you, who else knew that Baka was meeting with Marshall? - Someone must've known. Jon Marshall wasn't just murdered. He was silenced. - Listen, listen, we both know Jon Marshall was an agent. What I need to find out is what got him killed. - The case is closed, it's ashes. Just forget it. - Forget it? Do you know Michael Power? He's not gonna let it go, Colonel. It ain't gonna happen. - Off the record. - Okay. - Listen, recent events changed everything. Marshall focused on tracking financial transactions to do with arms deals to terrorists. - But what was he doing in Thomas Rhines' corporation? - Come on, Ed. - Hey, you tell me, there's a chance this information can be controlled. - It was just a cover to keep him in Africa. - That cost him his life? Can't confirm that. Unfortunately, he was killed before he could be debriefed. To the tell you the truth, Ed, it's one hell of a mess. To compound the problem, vital information is missing from his personal effects. - Like what? - Classified. One thing for sure, Marshall got caught in the firing line. So you warn your friend Michael Power to walk away. This is one story he doesn't wanna write. Good evening, Mr. Power. We were expecting you. - Wow, you look great. - Thank you. So, where are we going? - Surprise. - I love surprises, but just not like the last time. Look, you're quite early. Can I show you around? - Okay. - Secretary Ojuka's a great patron of the arts. He has one of the largest private collections of African art. - Quite unique. This is exquisite. It must be priceless. - Not too close, though. You'll set off the alarm. The only the way we can insure all of this was to install a new state-of-the-art security system. It's just down the hallway. - Excuse me, ma'am. You have a phone call. - Oh, thanks, Massey. I'll take it in the drawing room. Excuse me, Michael. I won't be long but, please, take a look around. The funds will be transferred a week before the troops are deployed. - And the artillery? - What? We will need enough to overcome any federal forces. - I have already taken care of that. They will be transferred from airport hanger four. It is imperative that my name is kept out of this whole affair. We can't afford any further mistakes, like Marshall. I made sure that he will never talk again. - So sorry to have kept you waiting. - No problem. Shall we go then? - Um, yeah. We will need enough to overcome any federal forces. It is imperative that my name is kept out of this whole affair. We can't afford any further mistakes, like Marshall. - The piece on the water crisis is gonna have to wait. - What? - I think there's gonna be a coup. You sure about this? - You okay? - Yeah. It's on my foot. - Let's go. - Michael, there's not much security for an armory. - Shh, keep it down, Ed. Let's go. - Oh, shit, they've already moved out. - They are going for the coup sooner than later. The only way to stop it now is to blow the conspiracy wide open. - Okay, okay, maybe we've got something. This guy, Willem Le Trois, he's a rogue financier currently involved in negotiating deals for an arms firm called Arms Link. - Arms Link is a major supplier here in Africa. Are you sure it was Ojuka you heard? - Yes, I recognized his voice. They were meeting as I left Ojuka's house the other day. - Well, if Ojuka's involved, we don't know how far this reaches. - What is it, Michael? - Something doesn't feel right, but I need to be sure. - Well, why don't you check out this blown up photo of Jon Marshall from the press conference the other day. - Can you zoom in a little closer? Marshall's on a cellphone. That certainly wasn't among his personal effects. - I am going to give the president's press secretary a chance to respond. Michael, exposing a coup and naming names will have serious repercussions. So you should keep a low profile until you hear from me, hm? - Well, as it happens, we'd planned to be out of town. - Good. - We'd better be going. Good luck. - Thanks. Nurse, I need a phone that works. - Should I taste the soup? - The soup, you gotta have a taste. Can't get enough. - It's a great atmosphere here. This is my family. They mean everything to me. Cheers. If Laura could see this, she'd love it. - Next time, bring her. You know you're always welcome. - She wants a divorce. - I'm sorry. - No, it's... No the real problem, there's been three of us in our marriage. Her and me and GSN. - But do you know what you want, Ed? - I still want Laura, but, Michael, it's easier said than done. We've already separated. I moved into an apartment on the West Side. - Hey, if it's Laura you want, go for it. It's never too late. GSN can look after itself. - Mr. President, I was with you in Bahrain yesterday. I could never be party to a rebellion against your government. If Willem Le Trois being a guest at my house is a problem, he's sure to get my resignation in the morning. - Charles! I don't want your resignation and I do not doubt your loyalty. But I need answers here about Willem Le Trois. - I've known Willem since I served in the Ministry for Defense. He's the financial advisor to Arms Link, but I had no idea what he was planning. Mr. President I can order Willem Le Trois immediate arrest. - Mr. President, apprehending Willem Le Trois messed up the coup in this instance, but armed forces are presently equipped to counter an attack. - What was the name of the other arms company that submitted a tender? - DeFactor. Hmm. - Michael. - Michael? I just received a phone call from the president. I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill your story. I'm sorry. - Come on, let's don't beat yourselves up here. The only part of our story that was questionable was Secretary Ojuka's involvement. We were right about Willem Le Trois. - But how did Ojuka manage to be in two places at the same time? - Come on. Let's look on the bright side, huh? By exposing the coup, at least we saved some innocent lives. - Okay, so we foiled the coup. But now the president is going to reinstate the defense budget, at the expense of what, the water project. People still lose. - Anita, are you ready to go? - Yeah Jomo. - Hey Benji. - Hey Mr. Jomo. - You've done a great job on this car, huh? Hey listen. Now don't spend this all at once, okay? - Thank you Mr. Jomo. - My pleasure. Michael, great party. - Thanks for coming. - Hey, stay strong my brother. Hey, I'll see you soon. - All right. - Mr. Ed. - Yeah Benji. You're supposed to show us the video. - Yeah, yeah I remember. I told him I'd show him the stuff I shot at the party. - Uh sure, go ahead. I'm gonna go break the bad news to Chief Fobio. Come on, let's go. - I can dance, watch. - They're loving it. - Look, that's one from yesterday. Play it again Mr. Ed, play it again. - Okay. There you go. - Look that's me. - It was recorded. - You lost me. - It was pre-recorded. That's how Ojuka was in two places at the same time. - All right, run that by me again. - The meeting. - Yeah. - Ojuka pre-recorded for my benefit. What better alibi to have than the president himself. - Michael, why would they want you to know about the coup? - There never was a coup Ed. I mean look at the facts. My apartment gets burglered. Hey, hey! Nothing taken. I get shot at. They miss. Then I see the meeting on the security screen. That makes me believe there's a coup. I have already taken care of it. It will be transferred from airport hanger four. - That leads us to hanger four. And what do we really find there? Nothing. Ed, it's been a setup. I've been the right man, in the right place, at the right time, but for who? - So we have all been victims of an elaborate conspiracy to manipulate the press, but why? - You know initially I thought this was all about power, but now I'm convinced it's about money. - How did you figure that out? - Hear me out. It's all connected to the president's decision. Willem Le Trois is involved with Arms Link. Arms Link lost the defense contract when the president opted for the water project. Now, they wanted me to write the story about the coup in order to scare the president into believing that the country was in danger so he would reinstate the arms deal. - But Michael, the president's not gonna give a contract to Arms Link if they're implicated in a coup. - In fact, he's already offered the contract to DeFactor. - Mm, and a rival arms company. - Michael. Your instincts are usually right, but I simply can't afford to get it wrong twice. If you think it's all about the money Michael, just the money. Can I use your phone? I don't think this one is mine. The police must have returned the wrong one to me. - When is a phone that looks like a phone, not just a phone. When it belongs to the CIA. - John Marshall's phone. - I'll bet every piece of information that Silverman wants is in my hand. - Let's get this over with. - Our information first. - Let's see it. I don't have to remind you that it's U.S. Government property. - Who was Marshall investigating? - That's classified, you should know better Ed. - That's not what we agreed Colonel. - Next time make sure you get your information first. - It won't be of much use to you without the SIM card. New deal Colonel, no information, no SIM card. - You told me that Marshall working for Rhines was just his cover. - So I lied, shoot me. The card. - Just one more thing. The connection between Thomas Rhines and Willem Le Trois? - What do you think? Le Trois deals for Rhines. - You're saying Rhines owns Arms Link? - Now give me the card. - It's in the phone. So I lied, shoot me. - Son of a. This is crazy. Everybody's connected to Arms Link. But where is the payoff? - Look, Rhines is launching his scheme this afternoon at the National Grammar School. Stick with him until you hear from me. - All right, no problem. Where you gonna be? - There's a girl I gotta see. - Right. - Hey, what are you doing here? - At last, some peace and quiet. - You can't come in here. - I don't have any books overdue. And somehow I think that the gun pointing at you under the table counts for more than some petty library card, don't you? - What do you want? - If a joker thinks he can double cross me, he thought wrong. When I get my money, I might see you again. - Michael, well what are you doing here? - Surprised to see me? - Um yeah, I'm afraid you caught me at an awkward time. I've got a tutorial in five minutes. Look I'm sorry, but can we meet up later? Michael? - What were you promised to set me up? A post in the London Embassy? - Sorry? - You know I can understand Ojuka, Willem Le Trois, and even Thomas Rhines, but you, why you? - Look I don't know what you're talking about. - You set me up! - Look, I don't need to listen to this. Michael will you leave, now. I want you to leave Michael, please just leave. - You are going to serve just as many years in prison as Secretary Ojuka, for murder. - I didn't kill anyone. - But you're an accessory. It's just as good as murder, and for what? For what Sabina? Arms Link has lost out on the contract to DeFactor. That means no money for Rhines, no money for Ojuka, no money for you. You've won nothing. - And who do you think owns DeFactor? Thomas Rhines. - Thomas Rhines. - Why did you have to get so involved Michael? - Give me your car keys. No! - Hey, oh! - You all right? - Someone just stole my car. Black Jeep. Get out of the road! - Get off the car! - Come on, come show us your dancing. - Move! Shit, shit! - Michael. Michael I'm sorry. Michael I'm so sorry. I had no idea they'd killed someone. Michael please, you've gotta believe me. Ojuka told me it was a matter of national security. - I need that videotape. How many more people must die before enough is enough? - And the availability of these computers in high schools across the country is sure to encourage literacy among the young generation. Who are Africa's future. Log-On Africa! - Yeah Michael. Okay no problem. It's what I do best. - Hey, got time for a memo? - Okay, all right. - Any questions? Mr. Rhines. Here, here Mr. Rhines. - Ed Johnson, GSN, are you aware Mr. Rhines that as of today the president has formally recommissioned the Water For All project? And with this putting a definite end to speculation regarding the defense budget being reinstated, what are your thoughts on this development? - Well I, I think it's good. It shows that the president and I are on the same page, bettering the lives of the ordinary people in this country. - And are you also aware that a conspiracy's been unearthed in which the banker Willem Le Trois and Federal Secretary Charles Ojuka, and an international businessman have attempted to defraud the government? - Excuse me, I have to leave. - Mr. Rhines. - Michael, he's on the move. - Thanks. - What took you so long? - The traffic was horrendous. Monsieur. I hope there won't be any delays with the money. The funds will be transferred a week before the troops are deployed. It is imperative that my name is kept out of this whole affair. We can't afford any further mistakes, like Marshall. I made sure that he would never talk again. - Sabina, you're home early. - Uh yeah, I'm just studying. - Okay. I'll be at Rhines house. - Okay. - Sabina. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired. - Take care. - Here it is. - Thank you. You okay? - It wasn't easy betraying Ojuka. - Where has he gone? - I'm sorry, but you don't understand everything about me you know? - Where has he gone? Where has he gone Sabina? - Thomas Rhines house. - Prove to me I'm not crazy for believing in you. - I warned you that Willem could become a liability. But you, you didn't listen. - Oh shut up. You were supposed to make sure he was paid his cut before he left the country. - There were delays in the transaction. - Did you think he would leave without his money you idiot? - Be careful how you talk to me. I'm still the Federal Secretary to the President. - President, president's only as powerful as men like me allow them to be. You're just another corrupt politician. - Hello, police commissioner? - You have lost nothing. You don't come from here. You can simply pack your bags and move on to another deal. But me, this is my home, my life. I have lost everything, everything. - Open the door Thomas, open the door! What are you doing, open the door you piece of shit! Open the door! Get me out of here quickly! Let's go! Do your job, do it now! Shit, don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm Secretary Ojuka. - Hold fire, hold fire! - I've been held hostage. - Secretary Ojuka, we received information that Willem Le Trois was hiding here. - I'll need a police escort, immediately. This is a matter of national secur-- Sabina? - Secretary Ojuka. I am arresting you for murder and grand conspiracy to defraud the government. This has got to be a big mistake. I need to contact the president now! What have you done? Sabina. What have you done? - Kelvin this is not the way to the coast, we're circling around. Kelvin, Kelvin! Michael Power. Okay let's talk business, what's your price? - Sorry? - Everyone has a price my friend. I need you to fly me to the coast, what's your price? A million dollars, two? Give me a number. - You know I've often wondered how people like you sleep at night. But I don't suppose you have a conscience. - I'm a traitor, there's no profit in a conscience. - And I'm a journalist, conscience pays my rent. - What's your price? - What's my price? I have covered wars all over the world. I have watched people die just feet away from me. Staring at me with their last gaze, just hoping, praying for an answer, an explanation as to why it was necessary for them to die. That you Thomas Rhines stood to make vast sums of money, was just not an answer I could bring myself to give them. You can't afford my price. - On my bluff, I think you'll find my previous offer was a lot more attractive. Oh you're a very smart man Mr. Power. Perhaps smarter than I am. But I have wisdom, that's what age gives you. At my age, I know I'm far too old to go to prison. - I don't see you have a choice. - Oh. I've just made my choice. - Michael Power. - Mr. Commissioner. - How did that anonymous tip-off about the alleged sighting of Willem Le Trois lead to all this? - Thank you, I knew I was due for. - Well it's the least I could do. It's over between us, isn't it? - We didn't exactly start off on the right foot. - Mitigating circumstances. - If things were different. - I understand, goodbye Michael. Don't forget to write to your parents. - So Michael, are you telling me you wrote this, huh? No seriously, good work my brother. - Thanks man. Is our surprise ready? - Yeah. - Cool. - I can't believe you put in a good word for the intern. - Oh, it's an inspiring piece of work. Arms and water, too much of one, too little of the other. Well done. - Thanks mom. A toast. Well, unfortunately Ed is leaving us tomorrow. - Oh yeah. - Ed. - Please join me in raising a toast to the man from GSN. A colleague, and a true friend. You're be sorely missed, Ed. Ed. - Speech. - Thanks, thanks. It's been some trip. I feel like part of a family now. - Oh yes Ed. So listen um, as a new member of the family, why don't you get the rest of your family a round of drinks, eh? - There's me, thinking I could just slip away quietly. - Oh yeah, you think so. - Michael. Uh, I talked to Laura last night. - Yeah? - Yeah. She's picking me up at the airport so. - Really? - Yeah. - Well have I got a surprise for you. - Laura. You're something else Michael. - Jomo will be driving you down to my village. My family will be taking care of both of you for the next couple of days, enjoy it. - Well listen guys, look we got a long journey okay, so let's make tracks, eh? - Oh by the way, give this to George, he'll understand. - You're not coming? - Are you kidding? I still have to write my water story. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ Good morning Mr. President. - How are you Harry? - Welcome to our small town. - Thank you. - Mr. President, Michael Power. - Mr. President. - Michael. - Thank you very much Mr. President. - Oh no Michael, thank you.
