( Roars ) ♪ Hmm. If this thing were any more powerful You could see the lord himself in his heaven. Well, as I say, If you want a job done well, don't leave it to a lesser man. ( All grunting ) Come! Come! Bugger off! No!!! Come on! Behave, will you? ( Screaming ) girl you have the devil in you! You're running my feet off! Aaah! Stop wiggling! Hold still, child! Let me go!!! Let me go!!! ( Shouting ) Stop it, child! Behave yourself! I could find you a quieter one if you like. Child! ( Coughing ) be still, child! Show him the pendant. Oh, yes. You're no help, child! Man: that is as described. Let me go! How dare you! Man: I have a more terrible lesson for this child. It's been an overly long adventure locating you. As we may be together for some considerable time, young lady, Allow me to introduce myself. Nun: that little vixen will bite it. Miss flora, my name is Hibble. Your mother, Moll Flanders, Was a murderess, was a mother, and a thief By her own account. The loss of her soul, to some, Was of as little consequence As an ember drafting up a chimney. I am instructed by a wealthy benefactor To offer you the chance to accompany me. In return for your board and keep, I am to read you this... The firsthand memoirs of your mother. Your benefactor hopes that you might... Note any seeds of her character That might try to... Root in you. Do you understand my words? She doesn't respond to words. I'll respond to anybody that treats me Like I've got a soul as good as them. Indeed, there is much of her in you. What is it? I was separated from a considerable amount of coin On the grounds that only silk would suffice. Are you taking me into sin? I'll spend ten eternities... You may rest easy. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics Are the only possessions he'll take beyond the grave. Pray dress yourself. Now to business. "My name is Moll Flanders. "I was born some thirty years ago in a prison in London. "But my body, a female, and my station... Moll Flanders: "...is a prison of the flesh "that I have worn for the length of my life. "convicted for some theft so small "that its significance was lost to all memory, "my mother gave up her virtue to a prison guard... ( Woman screaming ) Woman: push! Push! "in the age of reason, even the English were too genteel "to execute a pregnant woman, "so my mother received nine precious extra months of life "and then was hanged as a thief that night. "deprived of my mother by the authorities, "I was delivered to their machine of civic love, a home for orphans and foundlings." ( Bell rings ) ( Baby crying ) Man: Millgate prison. Another of the lord's lost. Never stops them, does it? Boy or girl? Boy or girl?! Girl. Flanders. Moll Flanders. God help her. Moll: "my mother had sold the only thing of value she had... "her hair. "I tried to navigate my early life "by what she'd purchased for me... "a tuppeny brass cross. "there are some who'd say "I'd grown up an ungrateful wretch. "even as a young woman I'd betrayed those who fed me and gave me spiritual sanctuary." ( Whispering ) Moll. You... don't! You're mad. Quiet! What is that?! It's for the poor, mother. Bless me, father, for I have sinned. I had a jealousy of Mary Barnes And I wished sister Orian would die. Have you had impure thoughts, my child? I've been thinking of you. Oh. And what are those thoughts, my child? Hmm? If I did something... What would that be, my child? This! Aaah! Keep your hands to yourself, Satan. Nun: confess! He's the sinner! Stop your lying, Moll Flanders! I am not a liar! He's touched every one of us! Hold the evil tongue! Priest: liar! Damned from birth, just like your mother! You've no right to wear the cross of Christ! You take that and I'll call the devil himself after you! Yeah?! Sure as hell roasts souls He knows what you've been doing! No! Leave her the lord's symbol, father. I'll get her to confess. Then do it! Do it! Do it! It's a man's world, Molly. He'd beat you to death to hold his position. Don't you understand that? If you believe me, why won't you go to the bishop? You are so young. Let the lord take care of them. But I thought you were a sister to do good. I do... the best I can. You're scared of him, too, aren't you? Well, I'm not going to fear any man of flesh and blood. No matter what costume he wears. Moll: if god made me in his image, Shouldn't my thoughts and my ideas be like his? ( Flapping of wings, bird chirping ) If you have any use for my miserable life... I pray help me. Whisper in my heart... A sign... Don't be losing your mental parts, Moll. ( Bell tolls ) ( Bells continue ) Nun: where are you going?! ( Birds chirping and singing ) I am a sparrow. "despite the depravity of my past "and the uncertainty of my future, "I shared a strange joy amongst the least of the lord's feathered flocks. "I had discovered a truth of nature: "Hope comes to the young as naturally as spring rains..." My mother... did you know her? Can a man truly know any woman? You've got a snake for a tongue, haven't you? You say her book tells her as a foul murderer, and worse. Well, some of her stories were quite unparallelled. Why would anyone help the daughter of one such as that? Perhaps to discharge a debt. Just who is my benefactor? The answers will come, But not if your mouth is working harder than your ears. Just who is my benefactor?! Either you have no patience or no manners. A woman of wealth has taken up your interest. One Mrs. Allworthy. Despite her high position, She has earned a terrible reputation For being incited to cruelty. It is suggested she had to leave england Because her vexatious deeds Might have got her gullet slit. I warn you... curb your antics. And you would deliver me to such a person? Bloody hell. It is my fondest hope that your sweetness and purity Will transform her. What is me mother's part in this madness? Your mother, god rest her soul, was Mrs. Allworthy's maid. I'm just the daughter of some ninny servant girl? She was a remarkable woman. How'd this remarkable mother of mine die? Push. Push. I have planned this trip to the last detail, And my schedule will be played out. Well, I have the need to pee in my schedule. As I said, I planned for every detail. Ugh. Lord. Child, how long can it take to pee? I say, aren't you done yet? Ah, damn! Man: watch yourself! See, dad's right. It's just like you said. Let go of me! Cunning little whippet, ain't she? You son of a whore and a horse's ass! As I said, I planned for every detail. Ugh! Ahh! Now, where was i? Ah. "Life was making me... "...a student of her mysteries. "she sometimes provides a fortune, and sometimes a disaster." I'm not going back! Man: she's a madwoman! ( Shouting ) "but one clear message i started to glean: no matter what your station, never surrender hope." Get in there! "my pell-mell flight had brought me to a suburb "whose tax rolls were overwhelmed "supporting the spawns of lost young women. "they would give me sanctuary. Satisfied? "presuming, of course, certain conditions could be met." Ahem. She is intact, sir. Ah. Well, young lady, I have arranged With these gentlefolk of good conscience To take in such strays as yourself. Do not let your conscience fail them, Or you will know my wrath. Understand me? I may be born from nothing, but... I've all the sense I need to value my fortune. Welcome to the family. "so, unbelievably, like some Cinderella, "I was to complete my journey to womanhood "with the daughters of one Mrs. Mazzawatti, "learning the accomplishments of a well-brought-up young lady such as dancing, French, music, and charity." Have some bread. What are you in here for? None of your business. Go take your pleasure at someone else's expense. ( Baby crying ) pleasure? If not for you, for your baby. It's Christmas. Go on. Thank you. Have some bread. Bread? Old woman: I'm very sick. A drink? You fool! That's jail fever! Them spot's as good as the hangman. Woman: Moll, it's smallpox! Save your mercy for those with a better chance! Who better deserves my mercy? ( Clears throat ) Put one at every point. Molly's got the pox. ( Singing ) ♪ Molly's got the pox Both: ♪ a tissue, a tissue ♪ We all fall down It's not funny. I see a spot on her cheek. Ooh, and another. Going to save a hanging, Moll? ( Chuckling ) You want me dead? Do for me yourself, then, go on. We have our butcher slaughter the pigs. You've shamed me. If you want to see the sort of charity I expect from a daughter, Tonight Moll was a living lesson. Go and get ready for our guests. That's if I'm not too embarrassed to be seen with you. I'm sure it's just the excitement of the season, ma'am. I wish it was, Moll. "by unconscious design, "I was becoming a stone in the comfortable shoe "of this household. "I realised I might be stealing something I never had: a mother's love for her children." How something so ugly can be so quickly fashionable, ay? Quite so. ( Grunting ) Quite so. Thank you, sir. If I were young, I'd marry my daughters And I'd get me to the sugar islands. There's fortunes to be plucked from the ground there. That's the life! Sun and money. And no damn gout! ( All laugh ) What plans have you for the future, young lady? Well, I always thought I'd become a sister of mercy. But I reckon that's too hard a road For anyone with their own ideas. And what are those ideas? Well, one day I want my own coach. With a glass roof, so I can see the stars at night. How charming. Indeed. ( Both giggling ) Ahem. Moll, isn't it? Yes. Thank you. Let me help you serve, Moll. Many hands make light work. But I want to repay the Mazzawatti's hospitality. He's right. This is your first Christmas at your friends' table. Let us show you our hospitality. Serve me, Jeremy. Moll's first. She's the guest. "the Mazzawatti sisters planned acts of war against me. Their weapons were to be their superior culture." ( Playing chamber music ) "I returned their assaults. "my arsenal was something feral that nature had provided me... "a sense of self that these women would never understand, let alone possess." ( Music continues ) Bravo, Moll! Bravo, Moll! "on boxing day, "I was taken ill with great disfavours of the stomach. "I feared at first that the Mazzawatti girls "had plotted to poison me. "but as fate was to twist me, i was wrong. "they were capable of a crime against me... ( Screaming in distance ) "I had just not foreseen its nature." ( Screaming, sobbing ) Well, young lady. It seems your conscience Has proved quite an inspiration to this family. They sold some of their Christmas jewelry To raise funds for the poor. Sparked by your acts of kindness, They entered an area so rough Even my men go in squads. The price of their compassion was their virtue. "wracked by my own guilt, "I could not stay. "Adam, the butler, told me of another home for young ladies "run by a gentlewoman who was privy to those "of the highest ranks of society. "with my head down against the rawness of the dark air, "all I remember is the flickering yellow sheen "of the night lanterns on the road beneath my feet. "at the end of our journey, amidst the yellow lanterns was one additional reflection: i found it rich, and so pretty." "I found it rich, and so pretty." I'm just resting my eyes. You are learning from her story? No! I want your dumb sermon over with. ( Hits roof ) Whoa! For nine years, I've sent agents to scour the countryside. And now I myself have searched every parsonage, charity, and workhouse To find the sweet little lost daughter of my mistress' maid. I ain't delivering some scullery hellcat Whose tongue is bigger than her britches, that's for bloody sure! Now you listen or so help me, I'll return you to that palace of god I just sprung you from. Is that perfectly clear to you? Drive on! ( Hits roof ) Begging your pardon, sir. Yes? I have a young lady. Thank you, sir. Go inside. Go on. Come in, girl... Before the cold stops my blood. "I suppose I should have been more aware, "but something in me cried out: "here was the home of my dreams. "here was not just wealth... but escape." ( Chamber orchestra playing ) Stand here. "and that's when I encountered "the awesome presence of Mrs. Allworthy. "to enlarge my understanding, "the lord had delivered me to a soul "with the alluring airs of some great duchess and the survival instincts of a country cat." What a strange world. Look what a curious young thing the wind has blown in. So, we're looking for a home? I'm willing to work for my keep. Just so, But in these times there are so many Who will labour for a roof. What makes you so special, miss...? Flanders, ma'am. It's Moll Flanders. Miss Flanders. What's your nature? I'm learning to have a very fair manner. Learning? It seems to be a necessity if one is to succeed. So... you've been a trouble maker. I've just stood for my rights. I can't countenance poor behaviour. It displeases my guests. ( Laughter ) your last job? I'm strong for my age. I have an honest upbringing, ma'am, and I won't eat too much. Meaning you have no skills at all. I have the memory never to be told a task twice. Hibble, my house is not a school. Can you find in your heart to try me, please? If you think me lazy or I displease you, Throw me out, and you've lost nothing. Miss Flanders. We have a contract, then. Hubble, find her some victuals. She's skinny. ( Laughter ) You've got brass, girl. There's not many stands up to her. That was you? I could never turn them away. Man: steady! Easy there, easy. ( Moos ) Where are we going? The Americas. That's the end of the earth! You have a reason to stay? Do I have a choice? Then I shall have to take my chances with your mistress, shan't i? I'll do the best I can for you. Like you did for my mother? ( Indistinct chatter ) Is something wrong? I loathe ships. I wouldn't mind meeting some pirates. Of course you wouldn't. And they'd kill you all and make me their queen. Oh, really. They say this is just a channel, And it gets worse in the Atlantic. All right, all right. My mother was evil. Awful. I shall never follow in her footsteps. Does that satisfy you? So throw away the cross. What? If you reject her, then throw away the crucifix. It's the only thing I have of hers. Then I must on with her journal. Damn, my eyes. Your mistress must indeed be an evil banshee If you're more scared of her than you are of these waters. There are more compelling motives than fear. ( Wave hits boat ) ( Gagging ) "Mrs. Allworthy's constant..." are you listening? Well, I'm not deaf, am i? "Mrs. Allworthy's constant contention was... "that all men are fortune hunters, "and, therefore, are fair game to be hunted in return. "and that women, logically, might as well be "taken advantage of by one of their own sex than just give themselves to men and see no profit in it." Ah, for your understanding, flora, This is rather... Delicate. Do you know what the male and female were intending? Sure. I've seen dogs in the street doing it. Yes, well, it's not quite the same thing. How do you know? You're not a dog. Huh. "Mrs. Allworthy never forced a woman... "into her service. "but, like a good horse trainer, "she made sure that the process became so familiar "that it was quite natural that one might eventually "be broken and saddled. "I viewed my new shelter with the wisdom of the young, so unaware as to how much i was yet to learn." ( Woman moaning in distance ) ( Moaning continues ) ( Horse nickers ) ( gasps ) Mrs. Allworthy ( in distance ): Hibble! Mr. Hibble! Where the devil are you? Hibble: oh, god. She'll tear the hide off me. Woman: you won't prattle on us? Mr. Hibble! I saw him. You, girl? Where? In-in the kitchen. What are you doing here? Are you being with him? No, uh, I was looking for a place to rest. I can see into your lying soul. Are you hiding something on me? Nothing. God's truth... You better not have been with him! You lazy trollop. You work, or you leave. Moll. I'm a man of gratitude, Moll. I'll remember. You're all right, you are. For a liar. Was he hurting you? Hurting me? ( Laughs ) you'll learn. What's so funny? God must have a dark sense of humor... Giving men them stupid whackers And us the desire to take them in. But it passes near to the beginning of creation For a feeling in your body if it's done right. And that's something that sow can't take away. ( Knock at door ) Come. What's happened to you? Went to a gentleman's house. Come on, get warm. Some gentleman if he didn't pay for a carriage. Mrs. A wouldn't let us get a cab. She'd rather keep the money. Uh-uh. Don't waste my wood. But Polly's cold. You know better. If she stayed at the fever home, How much would she earn you? ( Laughs ) Set fire to her if you want. Now, you, come dress me. Mrs. Allworthy: extremely profitable evening last night. Money's a faithful dog. Never asks nothing, Guards and comforts like a friend. But you gotta keep it close. Strap me up, girl. Taken my fingers to the bone, I have, Trying to breed this dog. Day or night, Gonna be one dead robber Tries to separate me from my hound. I can't make up my mind about you. I don't know if you're grateful or not. I'm working my best to show it, ma'am. No, you ain't showed your best. That's for you to catch the men with, Make us both happy. Fetch my gown. No, the blue one. It's Sunday. Can't wear red on Sunday. Mother of god, you'll have the blue-noses down on us. For wearing red? For everything them and their women are not. I've gotta take you in hand. Hmm. A man's nothing but a bull... Beast of lust. Say anything, do anything to ease his urges. God's not made a man fit to be woven up with yet. But there's precious few women Who learn to lead them by the nose. These are the most awesome weapons you have, girl. Prop them up, And a man won't be able to raise his eyes to your face. Sit down. Some of the finest gentlemen in London come through my doors. Wouldn't you want to have power over such men? So all they could think of was worshipping your young body? I was raised catholic. So was the virgin Mary, and don't tell me she didn't do it. That's blasphemy. No, that's common sense, girl. What are you saving yourself for? Give yourself some pleasure. Life's terrible short for some. You never been kissed, I'll bet. And why? Two flat pieces of fish Where there ought to be a red ring of allure. You've got to have the innocence of a doll. They wants the child in you. And the eyes. Tease them down there with your eyes. When a man's part goes hard, his brain goes soft. That's when they'll say or do anything to possess you. That's when you feel the power. Did you have this power over someone? Every man who comes through my door. Moll. Was she bulling you about last night? No. No, it's all right. Thanks. Edna and me... Well, it's not love. We have an ear for each other's troubles, you know? She's not so young anymore. I don't want the mistress after her. What would she do? She's capable of anything. ( Door opens ) There's no heart in the woman. ( Sighs ) Escaped from Cardiff prison hulks, I did. With a highway alchemist named gay. Oh. He could turn the lead in his pistols to gold. Mrs. Allworthy was his acquaintance. She hid him and me. But he died from a shot he took while escaping. For a while, she and i... Lord, makes me strange to say the words. We shared the same bed. I don't know what I done wrong, But she turned on me. Sudden. She won't touch me, But she won't set me free. Here. Thief. One word from her and my own skin will hang me. I've got this thing in my head. What thing? If the likes of Mrs. Allworthy Can have the gentry dance to her tune, I could have everything... No, Moll, no. A word from an old pilgrim: get yourself out of here. Find a farmer. Be a milliner's wife. Have a common man come home to you, lass. Don't travel her road. No good can come of it. With her money, I'd know how to be happy. ( Footsteps ) Mr. Hibble! Oh, lord, come quick! Come on, ladies, come on. Stand aside, stand aside. ( Crying ) What's happened? Polly killed the pie man. She murdered him? Nah, the old geezer would give us a pie or two For a twist in the larder. Can't touch him can't touch... Damn, Polly, now we ain't never gonna get any decent food. Aw, but you should look at the smile on his face. ( Laughter ) Mrs. Allworthy: five guineas? Now, surely, gentlemen... "I decided this wasn't prostitution. "that happened on street corners and back alleys. "this was making friends with eligible gentlemen... Noble, rich prospective husbands." This is not one of those young girls Who swear to their virginity And then get you drunk So that you don't notice the difference. ( Laughter ) No, this is the real thing. All the mysteries of eve waiting to be unravelled. Now, which of you noble gentlemen Is going to take this gentle flower To the full blossom of her womanhood? ( Men murmuring ) Fifteen guineas. Fifteen guineas it is. Do I hear twenty? I'll give you thirty! Christ, Moll, don't sell yourself for the bitch. I know what I'm doing. Forty guineas! Forty guineas for sir William and his lovely little dog. Lovely! Anyone for forty-five? Now, gentlemen, gentlemen, There will be only one night In this young lady's life In which, like a fine wine, You will be able to taste her innocence. ( Men chortling ) Man: fifty guineas. Fifty guineas! Well done! Do I hear fifty-five? I bid fifty-five guineas! Fifty-five it is, your lordship. Sixty? Sixty guineas! Do I hear sixty-five? Sixty-five! I have sixty-five. Do I hear seventy? One hundred guineas. One hundred guineas! That's put a price on her! Anyone else? One hundred guineas is a done thing. Bravo! Bravo! Prepare yourself for the pleasures of a lifetime. Thank you. I can't. Not him. Please. For god's sake, she's not ready. Shut up. For 100 guineas I'd put her in bed with the devil. Now, I hope I haven't wasted my time with you. I thought you had some bone in your back. Here. Find yourself. Go on. Go on. But do him good, or you'll hear from me. All right. ( Coughs ) Come on. Come on. He is fairly disgusting, isn't he? "I tried to prepare myself for the mystery of life... "to be worshipped. That night, I was not my most powerful." Did you give him his 100 guineas' worth? Worked myself up an appetite tonight, I did. Here, lass. Sit you down. I'm all right. Oh, come on. Get the girl a gin. I'll get you something to eat. I've got it worked out. If half the men that come have got wives, It's the other half I'll invest in. Don't build on it. Once you've earnt your living on your back, There's precious few men will love you. Here you go. This'll steady your nerves. I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. "I was the sparrow of hope looking for a nest. "clergymen, scientists, parliamentarians, insurance salesmen, and even an Eton schoolboy." I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet. "my life became a whirligig of sweating men's bodies and fairy tale hopes. "I kept kissing frogs looking for a prince. "and finding only cold, green flesh. "the science of life developed the other half of my female intuition. "men feel least obligated to those they can buy. "finally, I thought i was finding some light. A gentleman from east Chizack." He's mine, you bitch! He pays me! I've been doing him for weeks! ( Screams ) ( Yelling and screaming ) Stop this. Stop it! You're both bloody stupid. The man's a servant. He steals money to have you. Ugh! "and Mrs. Allworthy abounded, "haunting the streets in her new carriage, "allowing not a hint of sun "to defile her precious white skin. She found new and devious methods to fatten her dog." ( Knocking ) What in hell are you doing here? Good morning. Now, you see this entry? It was a measure of nine months. Who's here, daddy? Hello! God, woman, leave before my wife... It is just a matter of you giving a little support To the poor dear one over my shoulder. Oh, he's a picture of you, isn't he, sir? "we travelled, playing the same scene again and again. "it didn't matter that it was the pie man's child... "the power of nine months and the imagination of the guilty "served the purpose. ( Baby crying ) Allworthy ( to baby ): have some money. Polly says you're hurting. She must have caught on. She sold Edna. What? She can't just sell someone. She's gone. Gone to Ireland with a squire... A widower who took a charm to her. Lord help us, Hibble. Edna will have a roof. And a companion. She was losing her bloom. She might have put her in the street. God help me. You see before you a prince of pity, Moll. The coward's coward. "I didn't know why i could stand my own pains "but Hibble's loss broke me. "I finally understood how caged we all were. Children, come away. You're all sinners! Away. Come on. That's the devil's place. Come along! Come on! "for weeks I pushed myself into a gin bottle "like one of those ships a sailor makes. No, not this one. "and while I solaced, life prepared to play me again." Mrs. Allworthy: now, she's five guineas for what you'll want. Right. She's new. Very good. She's very skilled and extremely inventive. Seven guineas. Oh, no, sir, She's the shame of my establishment. Stupid girl won't be here long. Men complained. I just keep her to do the ones the others won't. Want to worship me? Do you want to see my weapons of love? Molly... how much? Half a crown. And you'll be lucky to get your money's worth. ( Indistinct chatter ) Hello, darling. What are you looking at? Where the bloody hell do you live? Taking me to heaven, are you? God! You all right? The steps are crooked! It's an old house. Don't believe in keeping order? It's not pretentious, but it serves my needs. It's more than I've got. Would you sit over there, please? Have you got a drink? I don't drink very often. You will after tonight. It's nothing personal. I offend everybody. What are you doing? Why'd you pick me, anyway? 'Cause you were the cheapest. Now, there's a blow. I wanted to... Paint a woman. You paid just to look at me? What's wrong? It's the strange ones that hurt people like me. Gin... Or whiskey? I believe I could get a bottle of something nearby. Makes no difference. Come on, mister. ( Moll sighs ) ( Door opens and closes ) Hello. All I could find was whiskey. It's all right. Don't touch that. Why not? Oh, god! It's all right. You're gonna kill me! No. It's all right. Please don't! You're not gonna hurt me? No. Not unless I fall on you. True? Yes. You bastard! You scared me to death! I may be an ignorant trollop, but I still got feelings, you know. I apologise. Speech is not my first language. I attempt to make a living doing these studies. I don't know whether I'm an artist or a scientist. Life fascinates me. Everything has a purpose. The way our hearts work, the way our very blood flows around our body All fits together in a brilliant system. But part of me really yearns to catch what truly animates Our human clay. What are you doing? I want to see who I really bought. Why? Because you look like a drowned clown. So do you. There used to be more of me. But the booze is thinning me down. Must have drank himself to death. ( Chuckles ) Could you please keep a little more still? I don't know how you sleep. I beg your pardon? With all these dead folks' parts lying around. What kind of person would let you cut them up like Sunday joints? People will them to science. Well, this body ain't willing. No matter how cheap it goes when it's alive. You're not very good, are you? I don't have an egg for a head. I'm only starting. It's Rembrandt's lines of form. I wouldn't copy him, not if he painted people with eggs for heads. Do you really not know who Rembrandt is? Not even if I'd slept with him. Maybe that's your problem. You can't live someone else's life. You've got to do things your own way. Please, sit down and let me see what I've paid for. A carriage? Have you left your senses? Found 'em, more like. Didn't I warn you? What's wrong with your feet? Nothing! He wants me every night for the next fortnight. A carriage each way. You? ( Coins jingle ) me. Whatever you did to him, teach it to the others. I never touched him. I'm shivering. I've got bloody goosebumps. ( Chuckles ) Missed. I wasn't aiming at you. Yes, you were. Weren't. Did I miss that time? Would you please sit still? I told you, I'm freezing. It's freezing. Just sit there... And hold this. It looks just like a mirror of me. It's good? ( Dejected ) brilliant. It's not good? It's just... It's just so damn mechanical! I'm there. Yes, this muscle is connected to this tissue... Da Vinci could have made your eye dance with a touch of light from his brush, But he wasn't painting the thing, the body, He was capturing its... Its spirit. Well, the spirits in me cost tuppence a quart, love. ( Chuckles ) you've the devil's spirit in you, all right. There's nothing in me. Hard like a rock. That way there's nothing inside to get confused. And the moon is made of green cheese. Come. You see the restrictions of your mortal body? Close your eyes. Inside you... There's so much space. The cosmos. You see? Inside, you go on forever. I'm stone. You want to paint another one? No. I'm just the wrong woman. It's not you. I don't think these hands will ever capture you. You're a kind man. ( Thunder crashing ) Driver: whoa. Giddyup. Hello? Hello? Hello. Aaah! That's the last of them. Teach her the lesson. Moll: I didn't know where else to go. Who did this to you? It happens. Careful, Jonathan, this is no stray kitten. You don't know what kind of person you're letting in your house. Strangely, I find the mystery intriguing. Send for me if she has any sign of tremors. Otherwise, it'll be a bad few days before she's comfortable. What are you doing? I need a drink. That's the last thing you need. Damn you, do you know how I feel? Angry, frightened, lost... That's how I'd feel. I'm not your friend. He's right, you don't need my kind in your house. Gently. Is it me you don't trust? You're hurt. Stay. I won't have a man tell me what to do! All right then, please stay. No. Leave then. Banish yourself. I'm telling you what to do. Do you hear me? My life's not some game. Mine neither. Well... good-bye. Damn you. I haven't got anywhere else to go! I'll sleep on the floor. No, I'll sleep on the floor. You are the most contentious person I've ever met! You haven't lived much then, have you? "days passed quickly in my new career. "in exchange for participating "in the quest to capture my soul in pigments and oils, "I was given food and lodging by a man who subjected himself to internal tortures." Damn! Let's not stay in today. Let's go do something fun. Just a second. This then. Just like that. I can't see you. Got it? Aah! Is this anyone you know? A rich widow from Wimbledon. ( Chuckles ) How come you haven't cut anyone up since I got here? I didn't want to disconcert you. Well, that's your income. From the looks of your scrawny body and this place, You haven't got two pence to rub together. You're a desperate man to pay to paint me, I'll tell ya that. But everything's on the surface, Moll. There are different kinds of desperation. Like what? Artist: the mad hermit that I am Lived a wild life as a child. I made wings from canvas and bamboo. I wished to navigate the atmosphere like a bird. Instead, I studied gravity and plunged 40 feet from the mill roof. My body lay static for weeks, But my mind travelled to places in fevers That are still vivid in me. One man came and was by my side day and night, A very old doctor, Touched, I am told, by my inventiveness. He exhausted himself. I'm still here, old man. Still testing the winds, Thanks to you. My parents treated me as an invalid. Frequently I would get sickly Just to reinforce their smotherings. I came to London to become a knight of medicine. But my stamina is insufficient for the work of a physician, So I dedicated my drawing to helping those who are better specimens. ( Bird calls in distance ) That child in me Yearned to create the extraordinary... A Parthenon, A Sistine chapel. And now... I think I'd settle for creating anything That would give me a sense of completion. What do you want from life, Moll? Nothin' anymore. Come on, Moll. I bare my soul... And I bare my bosoms. We make a good pair. ( Loud chatter and laughter ) Moll. Now, there's a sight. Can I speak with you private-like? Yeah. Hibble, what's happened to you? Moll, things ain't gone right. What's wrong? Hello, Molly. Driven off by the guardians of morals, we were. Lost my house, my girls... Getting out of Newgate cost me my comfort, girl, My faithful dog. She's looking so good. Isn't she, Hibble? So nicely attired. I think she's been finding while we've been losing. What do you want? I took you in. Put a roof over your head. Kept you while you was on the booze. Now you're coming back, and you're gonna work for me. I'm beyond you now. Come with me or I'll put you beyond everything. Moll, she didn't tell me this. I mean it. What's going on, Moll? Is that your business? More than you think. Oh, you got yourself a lover boy, Molly. Haven't you learned about men yet? He'll burn you. You're better off with me. Don't doubt I will use this. One small shot like that, so few grains of powder, Might kill me, most likely not. But I swear I'll live long enough To run this blade through your body six times And dance upon your grave before I drop. Woman: someone get a magistrate! Not here... Not today. You ain't worth my spit. Let alone my neck. I'll have memory of this. You'll pay me. I already did. Moll, I'm sorry. Here, have some bread. I'm sorry. Was that gun that useless? I lied. And... Rather well, I thought. Well? Take your boots off. You have yours on. I haven't been outdoors. This is very unimportant. Angry 'cause I cleaned for you? Don't do this again. I'll never find anything. There. Back where it was. God, that felt good! ( Both laugh ) "for a while, our lives went on... two strange companions in the circles of life." Madam. I wasn't long, was i? "No, Moll. Not long at all." That's a fine perfume. She was very pretty. It's not what you think. I didn't know she was coming. Again. If she's what you need... There are things I haven't told you. You don't have to tell the likes of me anything. Let's just get this over with. Civilised. I'm leaving. Slow down, damn you. That woman was my sister. She brings me medicines. A little money from my family. How does her kind like you having me for a lodger? It's not for her to know. So you don't want her to know. It's her I don't trust. It's all a mistake. Either I want you committed, Or I want you to free yourself now. Committed? To me. What?! Every night when you're asleep, I look at you And I fear one thing... That you might not be here. Don't you understand? I'm going to fail you. I can accept that. No, feel that! That's nothing compared to the pain that comes with me! Let me love you. Do I hide when your family come to visit? I'll tell them everything if that's what you want. "They hung her mother." Feel that! "She slept with hundreds of men!" Feel that! "She's a bitch and a trollop!" And I hate you! This is madness! Forgot me bleedin' stupid shoes. Put them under the bed, Moll. "I'd had sex with many a man, "but this was the first time I'd made love. "he willed his soul into me. "we were one, "a fusion of passion and unspoken knowledges. "we were a united force pushing back the darkness in each other's lives." Is something wrong? I always thought I had to be rich to own the stars. Moll... I want you to be my wife. Wake me up in the morning and say that. I mean it. We'll see if there's some chance with your family first. Then I'll answer. If you say so. Feeling cold? No, that's not what I'm feeling. ( Sheep bleating ) Welcome! Welcome home! Is that your father? Is that him? No, it's not going to be that easy, Moll. Welcome home! The master's home! Steady, boy, steady. Whoa, whoa. No. Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Well, this was your idea. Oh, god. No, thank you. Thank you. This is Moll Flanders. Hello. No, Moll. This is my mother, and this is my sister Charlotte. It's a pleasure to meet you formally. The paintings... I feel like we've already met. Yeah, well, I'm sure you've nearly seen all of me. Your father will be joining us. Please. Well, at least his body is working well. Servant: is there anything you would wish for, ma'am? Moll: no. We'll have some wine. You know how your father feels about alcohol. Some red wine, Gareth. I brought it with me in the carriage. Moll, let me explain the little hypocrisies of my family. All this comes from the success of the family's breweries. It is an honest business. Profiting from the sins of the little man. What school did you go to, miss Flanders? Um, convent of the sacred heart. Nice place, sort of. It provides work for the indolent. It is an honest business. But please, let us not spoil what is truthfully a wondrous occasion. My son has returned home. So much has happened since you've been away. But we can share all that later. But god so help me, if you... Wanted a woman at last, Surely you could have paid for one. Oh, I did. Moll is my model. And my fiancee. For a few pennies, she's helped me find myself... An experience you've denied me For the duration of my existence. Patience. Mother: my dear... It's obvious my son finds you very attractive. Whatever you wish... Name it. A thousand guineas? Five thousand? Ten thousand? Here. This is worth more than you could earn in a lifetime. You can buy yourself a future Without taking my son's away. All my life I've dreamt of owning something like this. Funny, I thought I'd feel more. I know who I am... And what I've been. And so does your son. I just thought maybe there'd be some chance I'd fit into your family. That would have made me the proudest living thing. But no one can separate me from this man. Unless he tells me he wants me to leave him. I love him enough to do that. But you can't buy me away. Father: this is all my fault, you know. I swear, it is my mistake. I should have never sent the boy to school in London. Observe, Moll. Great money does not a great human make. My son tells me that I have never demonstrated love for him. Well, let me see how I can do that. Well, I can at least protect him. If you marry her, I shall not only disinherit you, I shall excommunicate you. As god is my judge. Enough!!! You keep sending my sister to London with money to seduce me, But you never once came yourself! Oh, I didn't always take the money. And sometimes I thought I might fold And run back like some scared rabbit. But I haven't. And I never will.. As long as Moll is at my side. If pain... Is the proof of our devotion... Nothing hurts me more today Than the anguish which you have caused my wife-to-be. With this ring... I thee wed. Where's that wine bottle? Where's the wine bottle?! ( Both laugh ) "he found me in the mirror. "he became as fertile in his imagination as I was in my belly." "we experienced a delirious, timeless peace. It's moving. Keep still. Both of you. ( Bell rings ) It's a girl, Moll. I know it's a girl. I'll be jealous if you love her too much. If I close my eyes, I have enough love for the world And you at the centre of it. ( Chuckles ) you haven't a canny thought in your head, do you? Flora. I had a nanny by that name. She often stood between me and my mother. Flora. I think it's a beautiful name. "If in the act of creating humankind "God mirrored in us his image, "We and he are therefore equal in the struggle for rational knowledge..." Will you sit still? I am sitting still. You're not sitting still. "We and he should not be condemned for our failures Nor lose our wonder at our successes." So, student... What do you think? I think you really do have an egg for a head. Let me see this insult. Please. No. Please. I love you, too. Moll: I'm not climbing those stairs again. It's your turn next. How's it going? Fine. That's pretty. What is that? It's nothing. It's nothing. Yeah. Doctor: I'll send one of my people over. With a child in you, you should leave. Nothing will make me leave. I already threw her out twice. I'll find a way, no matter what the cost. I'm serving him as if he were my brother. It's not a matter of cost. It's smallpox. If you're a doctor, then cure him! He's trying his best, Moll. He's doing his best. "And if she chance to nod, I'll rail and brawl "And with the clamour keep her still awake. This is a way to kill a wife with kindness." You see? I could teach you a thing or two. You always could. Keep reading to me, Moll. I love you. I love you, too. ( Shivering and muttering ) That's enough. You need to get your rest. ( Coughing ) You're gonna get better. I will if only to stop you getting mad at me. If I could put my blood in your body, I would. I know. I know. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. ( Shivering ) m-Moll. What? My-my boots. Your boots? I want you to put my boots on. Your boots on? What are you talking about? I want you to wear my boots. ( Shivering and gasping ) Are they dancing boots? These your dancing boots? You're so silly. All right. There. You happy? You're going to have to wear them for both of us. Oh, don't. And for flora. Stop. I-i- I k-know you can do it. I found my creation in you. It's life. God is love, Moll. Love is god. ( Crying ) I love you so much. Give me your hand. So-so bright. ( Crying ) Why not me? Why can't you take me? Hibble: "why not me? Why didn't you take me?" I bet he wouldn't have let her abandon me, If he'd lived. Well... Time to sleep. No, don't stop. No, it's time. Come on. Five pounds. A desecration. You could use the money. It could help others. He already did. I have his letter of bequest. No man who touches him will live to get out that door. I'll give you time to think this over. "I stayed beside him for two days. "I feared if I left for a single moment, "they would take him. I used our savings to make him safe." "I buried him beside the old doctor. "I wanted him to have a companion in his last great adventure." ( Bell tolls ) "I had heard that letting one's blood flow "was as near a painless death as could be achieved. "but life was not finished with me yet. "I don't know what manias overcame me... "but if it was madness, it was also a strange lucidity. "we had not fused our souls in my belly "to make a mockery of all our efforts. "I felt that there was no living soul I could trust. "I feared his family would take the baby "in an instant. "so I determined to bring our child forth alone into this world surrounded with her father's spirit." "I was determined that the first thing "to brush the child's eyes would be the beauty that her father had created." ( Groaning ) ( Grunting, screaming ) ( Baby crying ) Okay, flora, it's all right. It's all right. It's your cross. "in order to put food in our mouths, "I was expending my memories. Even the best." I'll give you one shilling. That's very special to me. Five shillings. I'll give you two shillings, and that's all. All right. Three pence, six pence, nine pence, one shilling. "but in my darkness, i found a great joy in my new memories." ( Baby crying) I love you, too. "I left my child with a neighbour, a widow. I trusted her." She'll be fine, missy. "we were united in our understanding of grief. "I had used up my local area "and had to forage further afield. "I was failing, and failure meant i could not feed my child." Watch out! "my mind was racing. "part didn't know what was happening. "another part heard the devil in me... screaming. "all I could see was my child. The horror and the risk nearly overwhelmed me." Man: it's her! Thief! Thief! Thief! ( All shouting ) Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Moll: I didn't do anything! I didn't do it! Woman: hold! Hold!!! Why... that's my servant girl. Out of my way. I paid for them clothes. How dare you get them filthy?! I was just driving by. I didn't have you on my mind. I didn't do anything. Look at her shaking. Eyes like a rooster seeing the axe. Where's your little lover boy? Dead. He's left you to the gallows, girl. You want my help now? Are you sure? Eh? I said you'd pay. Your life is mine. Give me one soul... Who saw my girl in your shop. My girl may be stupid, but she's innocent. And when you accuse her, you accuse me. I have a lawyer who'll sue you out of house and home! But I have a generous nature. Fifty pounds will repair this slander. Or we can go to the barristers right now. "my life closed in again. "but at least I could trade my humiliation for food for my child." Found a friend in life, our Mrs. Allworthy. That pipe has done wonders for her disposition. She used to be miserable. Now she's bleeding intolerable. ( Coughs and chuckles ) Oh, we made a pretty little contract. Haven't we, Moll? Now this time, you better live up to it. Oh, rub my feet. Their tired. Now, bitch. Or you'll end up just like your mother. "then I believed in a crueler species above mere humans. "their power comes from so much strength of self that it freezes us like rabbits to be torn to shreds." "the journey took us through part of the city i had never seen." Where are we going? My luck's been changing, Moll. You're the living proof. Can't seem to put a foot wrong. 'Tis a grant of her majesty's lands Signed by the prime minister of england himself. ( Chuckling ) an old customer of mine. I plotted the most simple of coups, Filled my faithful dog with comfort, Bought a home in the new world. Fit for a merchant prince. Wanted me about as far away from London as one can get. So... we're all going together. Like a family. Are we leaving? Mrs. Allworthy. The next tide. Mrs. Allworthy. Mrs. Allworthy! I have to get my girl. I've got to get my baby! You ain't goin' nowhere! I can't leave without my baby! I'll fetch her, Moll. There's time. I'll fetch her. All right? What have you. On Stepney lane, where you found me. Second floor. See Mrs. O'Malley. Mrs. O'Malley. I'll find her. Oy, blackie, Got any news from the devil? Ow! Ugh. Sent you that. How'd you like it? Ugh. There was a... There was a fire on Stepney lane. I've got to go! No. No. No! They said they got as many out as they could. But god help me, I looked. I couldn't find them. No! No!!! I've failed you, Moll. Allworthy: hold her. Hold her, Hibble. It's her baby, ma'am! One less mouth. For god's sake! I said hold her, Hibble. ( Screaming ) Let me go!!! Now get her on that ship... Or I'll see you hanged alongside her. No! No!!!! ( Sobbing ) "a torment. "a pain so deep it cut through my soul. "I had sworn if I ever had a child, "the devil himself couldn't pull it from my breast. Then I knew deep in me that my child had lived." Damn that woman! There's no balance to life. We're the meek. We're supposed to inherit the earth. It's a terrible thing, Moll... But I still care for the wretched woman. Woman: Mrs. Allworthy! Mrs. Allworthy! Mrs. Allworthy! The ship! It's the ship! There! Welcome home, Mr. Hibble. Thank you. My mistress welcomes you. She wants to see you alone, Mr. Hibble. I shan't be long. This way, ma'am. Made a good impression on the missus, you did. She could hardly tell. I spoke well of you. She bids you complete your task. There's only a few more pages. What does this woman want of me? Nothing. Everything. "every night we crossed the Atlantic, "I dreamed of my child. "I had to believe i had something to live for. Excuse me, love. "with Hibble's help, I obtained a spare purser's log "and I worked on this memoir to talk to my child. ( Thunder crashing ) Sailor: the mizzenmast! Tie everything down! Quick, before we lose her! Give me a hand here, will ya? Captain: jack to the ace. Diamonds are trumps. Ace to bet. Ace bets. Oh, god almighty. That's rough. Here. What? There! Rocks! Captain Jarvis, are all men on deck? Allworthy: what's going on? Sailor: come on! Come on! ( Shouting ) Oh, god! Aaah! We're going down. We're doing down! We're taking heavy water! I'm gonna drown! I can't swim! Put it on me! Too heavy! You'll drown! You're young, you're strong! Ma'am, come on! Put it on! Come on! Hibble, my book! I'll get it! Where is it? By the trunk! Go! Hurry! ( Shouting ) I can't swim! Aaaah! Water's coming in! Aaah! ( Coughing ) Moll! Come here, girl! Too heavy! Help me! Help me, Moll! I can't swim! Help me, please! Not this hand nor this body! Call this murder, but never again! Damn you to hell! Never again!!! Hibble: Moll! Hibble! Moll! Hibble! Moll! Where are you?! Moll! Hibble: the name of Moll Flanders Was lost forever beneath the waters of that storm. I learned about the courage of living from your mother. But it never set well in my body. It was on a beach very much like that one That I learned the truth of myself, Because the lord spared only one other from that ship. I think it was to test me. No more stories. No more bleedin' lessons! Flora, you don't understand! Flora! Flora, please! Flora! Flora! ( Gasps ) I hate you! I hate all of you! She's still in here! Mine until I die! Flora? For nine years, flora, I kindled a spark of hope, The tiniest candle flame keeping your mother from the dark. As Mrs. Allworthy, she has everything a physical body could need. Except her soul. Now it's a matter of trust. Now you know enough of our deceptions to hang us both. I wanted you to hear my story. I wanted nothing but the truth between us. I never knew my own mother. Never felt her, or smelled her hair. I swore that terrible fate would not befall my baby. But I failed you. And despite my... ...deepest fear That my own flesh and blood might reject me... We have enough to send you anywhere in the world. The choice is yours, flora. Do with the truth as you will. Oh, mother. Finding this was easier than finding you. That seemed like a lifetime. It's your father, Flora. I love his spirit you carry in you. "we danced like sparrows around the flame of each other, "fluttering and gliding on the currents of our emotions. "we celebrated in the great truth "that I had learned from her father: "all men and women are created equal.
