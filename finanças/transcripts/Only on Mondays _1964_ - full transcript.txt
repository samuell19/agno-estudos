Yes. She's such a nice girl. She's got a sugar daddy. - A grand daddy. - And young ones too. - They're all lovers. - Is she a flirt? But she's a nice girl. - She looks friendly. - Really friendly. Good-humored and warm. - I want to make it with her. - Don't worry, she's easy. - Really? - Yes. She gives great service. She says her greatest pleasure is to make men happy. - Her goal in life. - You're kidding! - Is she a nympho? - No she's not like that. - But she likes to do it? - She's just true to herself. - She's pure. - But no kissing. - What? - Doesn't let her kiss. - That's only a rumor. - No it's true. A 'kissyphilistic'? That girl's clean. She's not like a whore. - And she goes to church. - Church? In a word, a lovable kind of girl. It sounds like she's our perfect girl. Papa. Huh? Why is a black person's skin black? I don't know. It's black. Yours is white. A half-breed. Spotlessly white. Jamaica. Dark like coffee. Ouch. My next-door neighbor is half Jamaican. Your skin is so white. Is coffee skin sexy? Hmm... Does it turn you on? Sounds hot. And good at bed. Wow. That's what my friend said. - A friend? - Yes. A travel agent. I want to travel! You can. Jamaica. Jamaica? Is that too far? No. You can go travel. I'll get myself tanned. I'd prefer you stay white. No. Papa, you just said coffee skin's sexy. I'd prefer you stay white. No. This announcer still has a cold. Every night without tiring and boring... I wonder when he sleeps. In daytime. He's sexy when he has cold, with his nasal voice. He sure is working hard. It's time. It's a bit late, again. Papa, you'd better get it fixed. You're late again. 'Asahi Shimbun' 'MacArthur's Retrospect' "I didn't know" 'Development of Nuclear Bomb' 'Constitution to be Amended by the Hands of the People' What? No, don't be mean. Your Papa. We go follow them? That should be fun! He'll get mad. Nah. They won't find us. Just for fun. Hey, let's go! Come on! How long are we gonna follow them? Papa's house is just around the corner. Don't blame me if he finds us. I'm too tired walking. Let's cut this out and have some rest. The Red Lighthouse would be okay with me. Yuka... Are you jealous of his wife? Stop it. Jealousy is plain ugly. Yuka. You're persistent. Let's go now. I've had enough. Hey... Why don't we do it here? Let's do it here. Yuka... Let's do it here. I've got money to pay a hotel room. No, no kissing. Last night I slept with a guy in a dark place in front of Papa's house. It was me who asked him. Osamu said he didn't like to do it on the grass because it was itchy, but I insisted because I really wanted to do it, in front of Papa's face. The reason why I wanted to do that to Papa is that, since my goal in life is to please men I push myself and work like a horse every night just to please Papa but for all my efforts, Papa seems to be just so-so pleased so I figured my efforts aren't enough to the point that I felt guilty but yesterday, when I saw Papa he looked so happy when his daughter asked him to buy her a doll and he never looked that happy when he was with me so when I come to think how a family can so easily achieve something that I can't no matter how, I was really shocked and felt defeated and although I knew that I was barking up the wrong tree I just couldn't help myself. I remember the reverend saying that jealousy is a bad thing. So, do you also think I am a bad girl? Oh yes, you are a bad girl. You are guilty of public indecency. I'll throw you in jail right now! But, I came here to make a confession a confession should erase my sins... - Shut up! Are you insulting me? - I'm not, I just came to confe... Shut up! Papa? Hmm? Papa, are you satisfied with me? Yeah... Are you really satisfied? Yeah. Hmm... What? Is there any woman who tastes better than me? Who knows? Just tell me. There should be, I guess. Someone you know? Well, you're among the best. Among the best. What? And I'm doing my best... Papa? Hmm? What makes you most happy? What can I do to make you most happy? I see a big trouble ahead. I'm serious. Papa is satisfied with the way you are. Very satisfied. Well... Your rent... clothing expenses... food expenses... Something's missing. You don't even let me kiss you. Utilities... You're not satisfied because of the kiss? transportation expenses... But that's just impossible. medical expenses... Instead, I'll do anything for you but for a kiss. allowances. Ah, your Papa's wallet is empty. I'm now keeping my household accounts just as you said, Papa. Papa? Hmm? A ship chandler delivers goods to ships, right? Hmm - A tough job, right? - Hmm Frank said it is a tough job. Do you know Frank? A Greek ship came in two days ago so Frank is now working really hard. - Yuka. - Hmm? What's this? Here. Income: 2000 yen. Income: 2000 yen... Remarks: found them...? They just popped out. Out of nowhere... 2000 yen. I made a profit! I'll show up tonight to your club, San Francisco. Really? With an important customer of mine. I'm counting on you. Bye. Have a good day. Good evening. When did you come back? I was surprised. You look fine. Yeah. How's Frank? He rarely shows up. Seems to be busy these days. Why did you leave without a word? You made me sad. I missed you so much I cried. It's true. A lot of guys left me. The one who left me when he found about Papa. The one who got tired of my body. The one who... after a fight, beat me and ran away. All sorts of guys. But back then, you were the only person that I loved for real. Why did you leave without a word? I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I just want to know why. I already forgot why. It was my fault. It's sad. You're always like that. What? You always blame it on yourself. Can't help it... because it's true. Well, yes. You're always like that. Blaming everything on yourself. You've always been a mature guy. I've never seen you get angry. You got upset that day, didn't you? For the first time. You banged the phone down. I was surprised. Then... the next day you're gone without a word. You made me sad. I'm sorry. My fault. There you go again. That night... I did a lot of thinking before I made my call. I never let you kiss me, remember? So... Let's give it a rest. That was a long time ago. We were loving each other but never slept together. That's why we broke up, right? something like that, OK? Hmm? What do you mean, something like that? What? What you said on the phone. I just said "sleep with me." What's the problem with that? You can say it if you like but... you'd better not say it to someone you love... from now on. Why is that? There are those who would want to marry you. Hey, how about a dance with me? I still love you. Don't use the word 'love' that easily. You are to be blamed. When a man says "there's no love" that's because your service wasn't enough. To love is to give your best. To give your best is to make a man happy. To please a man is a woman's greatest purpose of life. I've heard that a million times, mom. Love is something that's not logical. There's not one man in the whole world who doesn't like to do it. Though... a man is a real show-off. And a woman can show her skill by cleverly manipulating them. Don't worry, it's so simple, all you need is a bit of ingenuity. Even your mom can. Many men said they can't forget my taste and went looking for me all over Honmoku. That's because your mom never failed to give true love to every single first-time customer. Yes... I offered them great service. Trust me. You're right. That's what a woman was made for. It's you, Yuka. Frank. Osamu's not in. It's you I came to see. So? I'm busy now. I wanted to see you. What? I've changed. I think I've changed a little bit. Been doing lots of thinking lately. I want you to make love to me. You mean, now? You're the same as usual. It will be different. Now I'm emotionally different. I'm... trying very hard. You see I'm busy now. Why not? You just wait. I'm sorry. Nothing unusual here... So what's the change? It's... from the bottom of my heart that I'm loving.... you. I could do anything for you. Anything, because I love you. I love you. I'll do anything for you. You mean it? I do. I love you. You'll do anything that I ask of you? I will. Go dance with them. Which ones? There. Those people? Don't stop dancing till I tell you when. (Hasseiden sanctuary) It's all right. So who do I start with? I will love you, for real. I won't lie in the presence of God. What's the matter with you? Why don't you play paper-rock-scissors to decide whose turn it is? What's the matter with you? Hey. What's the matter with you? Papa. Where were you? What's the matter with you, Papa? Where were you? Look at the time! I'm sorry, Papa! Where were you? I'm sorry. You made me wait for so long. I'm sorry, so sorry. Nothing happened with anyone. Just dancing. It was boring. Papa, you're the greatest. I love you so much, Papa! Naughty girl. Papa. Hmm? You've been waiting here until morning... All right. I've much thought about that at 3 am. But I was left with no choice, you didn't come back after all. Why did you care to wait for me? Are you asking me why? Because of course I was worried about you! Papa? I... in the whole world... I love you... the most. It's true. I'd do anything to make Papa happy. Anything. Don't say such delicious words to camouflage. I mean it. What do you want me to do? I don't need nothing. Just don't make me worry about you. Would you like some coffee? Yeah. Hey. I've got an idea. What? A favor... would you do me a favor? I want a dolly. - A doll? - Yes! I'll buy you one anytime you like. Wonderful, I'm so happy! I'll get you one as soon as tomorrow. No, it's not for me that I'm asking. It's for you, I want to see you happy. Papa's paying for it, so why would Papa be happy? Now, now. You're not making sense. I'll come with you. OK? Together? OK. We'll go tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. Later on. I've got things to prepare. You're perplexing. Exactly. Very perplexing. I'm thrilled! It's fantastic. This morning... is the first morning with Papa. Papa? Huh? As soon as the water boils I'll make you a nice cup of coffee. Then... I'll make some toast... and the two of us... will have breakfast together. I've got some jam too. This is all so wonderful. Japan's no good. Furuhashi and Hashizume won't be there. - Can't expect much from Yamanaka. - How about Satoko Tanaka? We're only left with Women's 100m backstroke. 200m would be safer, but 100m is risky. And Fukushima. Backstroke? He did well in the last Japan-US championship. 1 minute 2 seconds 4. - You're in the know. - Then? A doll! - Okabe - He's no good. Furuhashi must be mad. He has no guts. Flip turn. That's what makes the difference. A doll certainly would. 800m relay. Break the 8-minute barrier? No way. A doll would. - Of course. - Really? Townsend, Schollander. Papa said he'll buy me one. - Will he be happy? - Of course he will. In Motomachi. - Saari, MacDonough. - 8 minutes 3 seconds 7. Will Papa be happy like he was the other day? You'll do fine. Are you sure? Absolutely. McDonough, 54 seconds 1. Amazing. But what about Osamu? Osamu would get mad. There's also this thing with Frank. You can never tell what he'll do out of passion. Saying sorry won't do! You should... take better care of yourself. I've warned you. I'm sorry. To begin with... It was Frank who introduced you to me. But now you have nothing to do with him. I'm sorry. - Sorry isn't enough. - I'll never do that again. - That goes without saying. - Yes. What a bummer! With me, it's the Red Lighthouse. And with Frank, it's a hotel. Should be the other way around. You're missing the point. I'm not. I want our relationship to be pure. Only with you. It gives me creeps, paying money for a filthy hotel room. There are clean ones out there. A hotel itself is a filthy place. Paying for a filthy hotel just like with the other guys. I know you have a lot of experience. I do have. That's why I don't want to. I don't want to go to a hotel with you. What a twisted logic. Red Lighthouse is way more pure. Let's not talk about it anymore. Anyway, I made a promise with Papa. - What promise? - A doll. A doll? Remember? We saw them in Motomachi. Papa was buying a doll for his daughter. Remember how happy Papa looked? I'd like Papa to have a happy face like that. This time it'll be me - he'll buy me a doll. Never seen such a happy face on Papa before. Yuka. Huh? You're wrong. Why is that? Even if you make him buy you a doll he won't be that happy. Well, he was with his daughter. That's because she's his daughter. I am like his daughter, almost. I call him 'Papa.' Stupid. Why call me stupid? You are stupid. I'm not stupid. I'll do exactly the same as the other day. Everything will be the same. We'll stroll through Motomachi, walk into that shop. Papa, and me. On a Sunday. Stupid! What now? Sunday is a day dedicated to family duties. Sunday is fun day 'cause you spend it with your family. A Sunday with you won't do. A Sunday with me won't do? You're supposed to spend Sundays with your family. Sundays with your family? Yes! OK then. If Sunday's no good, I'll have Monday instead. I surely deserve to have his Monday. Monday. With Papa... on Monday. He'll buy me a doll in Motomachi. What's the matter with you, Osamu? You go on thinking about making your old man happy. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Just when I'm in a joyful mood, you should be happy for me too. You idiot! How can I be happy with you and smile when you're trying to please my love rival? Mom? Eh. What should I do when I made my man angry? Made him angry? No, it's not Papa. It's another guy. I made him angry. Hmm. You remember Jimmy? No you don't... You know... I was Jimmy's 'only' girl. One day, I can't remember why, but I made Jimmy angry. I suffered a lot. Didn't know what to do. Then I went to a florist and bought an armful of flower petals. Then I went to Jimmy's house. It was night, pitch-dark. And Jimmy's house was glowing white in the darkness. I threw my armful of flower petals all over Jimmy's house. On the roof, the window, the entrance and on the floor. His house was entirely covered with petals. Next day, Jimmy came back to me like nothing ever happened. Tomorrow's the day. I can buy you one. - It has to be Papa. - Duh. You don't get it. Get what? What I really want isn't a doll. What's it then? Papa's happy face? But now, it's another thing I want. What? Now, I want to see your happy face. 'Request for a Leave of Absence' 'I would like to request a leave of absence due to personal reasons for tomorrow, the 27th.' Then Came Monday Hey, taxi! (Hotel Newgrand) My apologies for keeping you waiting, Papa. Yuka... I want you to meet my mom. Thank you very much for taking care of my daughter. Yuka, come here. What? Come here. What now? Come with me! - You're embarrassing me. - Why? - This is not good. - What do you mean? I'm talking about your mom. What a mess. You just don't get it. Get what? She's there to make you happy. Me? Me, Papa, and mom. Three of us are going to Motomachi to buy a doll. We're all set. Ready to go. Now it's your turn to be happy. You... stupid! Today I was planning to have an important talk, see? So I invited that important guest. Anyway... we'll talk later. Papa! Later, see you later. What about our promise? Papa. Papa! Mom. I'm sorry. And Ended Monday It's pretty. Huh? Yeah. Stop seeing Papa. It's not right. Stop it. Stop it, would you? Would you? I've been thinking. You told me the other day about the Red Lighthouse and the hotel. Have you... ever slept there with someone else than me? Just me? I think... I can take good care of your mother. I won't let someone like Papa do that. Why don't we get married? Eh? Get married? Yes. I'm gonna make more money. Then you'd... stop sleeping with the others, would you? I'll make money. Doing what? Something... down to earth. I will. Enough to feed two... and your mother. Then, we'll rent a small apartment. Rent an apartment? Yeah. Then, we'll need money. A little bit. Key money. Hmm. How much would we need? I'm not sure, but... 100,000 would be enough. 100,000 yen? Yeah. Probably. What will it be like to be married? What bothers you? Huh? This and that. It might change the way we do things. Hmm. Or change nothing at all. Make money, eat, make love together, and eat breakfast together. You're right. Would you let me kiss you... if we get married? Dunno. As I said, I panicked. Papa had an important guest, you see. And all of a sudden you introduced me to your mother. I bought you a doll. Here. I've got you the one you've wanted. I... I just panicked. I'm sorry. Tell your mother that I'm sorry. I was preoccupied with my customer. That captain I've told you. I am risking everything on him. A very important customer. We used to have lots of small boats coming in to Yokohama. So we had more business opportunities. But these days, the number of boats declined. So we have less business opportunities. Tobacco... water... those who deal in small commodities like that have more luck. But those who, like your Papa deal in larger products are feeling pressed. If you let others snatch from you... you're up the creek. And even if you managed to get your hands on you have to be prepared for your next move. Your Papa, like many others buy our merchandise with cash and deliver it to the ships. Agents pay us only 3 or 4 months later. During all that time we've got to keep some money lying around. I don't want to miss a chance. Papa is having a hard time. Your Papa is working on an important deal now. Understand? With that captain. I want you to do me a favor. Yuka, do me a favor. Would you please... sleep with that captain? I'll do anything for you. I'll do anything you'd like me to do. Your Papa likes Yuka very much. See? You are so adorable. I'll do anything for you Yuka, so please. Papa loves Yuka very much. Papa? Eh? Are we... going to break up? If you don' want me no more, we could. But all Papa wants is... if only Yuka agrees... to be with you like this, always. If I do as I'm told... will you be pleased, Papa? Will you be happy? Will you be the most happiest, ever? OK then. In return, I want 100,000 yen. 100,000? All right. 100,000 yen. What did you answer? What did you answer? You can kiss me. Yuka? What are you looking at, Yuka? No, don't! Yuka, don't you ever look at that. That is... the worst thing in this world to do. A horrible thing. A filthy thing. Osamu's dead. I have regrets. You know. Osamu was such a nice guy. I took care of him like he was my brother. Remember? The first time I introduced you to him. I remember it all so well. He had a crush on you, right? Such a pure heart. He begged me to let him have you, with tears in his eyes. Remember the Hasseiden sanctuary? The night before, we slept together in a hotel. And I left you in a beatnik bar, on your own. Placed you in the hands of young folks. I've had Osamu's feeling in the back of my mind. But... I was a bit jealous. Felt like saying "eat your heart out!" He was hurt. He stopped talking to me afterwards. I regretted it... yes! I did regret it. Yuka. You too should regret it! How about a cigarette? A match... where's the match? Oh, here it is. Anyway, he was a nice guy. We pushed him into this. You and me are both responsible. Did you know? The captain of California, the ship from the States. He went out to stab him... dunno why. All by himself. Blue in the face. A brave guy he was. He was so... You know, there's a rope... stretching from the ship. He was entangled in one of those and ended up being strangled. Died in an accident. He didn't even make it to the California. How frustrating... I feel so sorry for him. Both you and me are responsible. Wanna open the window? Oh, the rain's coming in. Cold? Everything's OK? This rain's too hard... Yuka. Why don't you kiss him? Give him a kiss. This is your last chance. He was serious about your love. Yuka, wait. Let me give you a ride. Just a minute, I've got to make arrangements to claim his body. Yuka! Ah, travel. Body OK. Kiss is NO! Kiss, no! Papa. Eh? Shall we dance? Let's dance! Yuka! Help me! Rope! Hey, Yuka...
