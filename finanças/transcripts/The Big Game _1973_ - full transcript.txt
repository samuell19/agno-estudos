Can you put everything on the table? Very good, put one here and one here. (speaking in foreign language) (phone ringing) - Pronto? - [Woman On Phone] My I speak with Mister Handley? - Oh Mister Handley's not in his room right now. Can I have him call you back? - [Woman On Phone] Yes please. - What number? - [Woman On Phone] Please tell him to call the embassy. He knows the number. It's urgent. - I will tell him as soon as he returns. - [Woman On Phone] Thank you. - You're welcome. (speaking in foreign language) My name is Atanga. - That's perfect. - Well my love that was quite a performance from you last night. - Really? - At the club, you were smashed. - So strange, I don't even drink. - The Ambassador wants you to call him. - Oh yeah. Six four seven four please. - Put the blame on me if you're late. - Yeah. - [Woman On Phone] American Embassy, Rome. - Jim Handley. Jim Handley here for His Excellency, the Ambassador. - [Ambassador] Hello Jim, I was expecting you at nine, what happened? - Please forgive me sir, I had some, something came up. - Well that's okay. How soon can you be over? - About eleven? - Okay Jim, see you later. - Fine sir. - I love you. I had a wonderful time last night. I enjoyed myself. - Well that's the way it should be. - Look what you gave me. - [Jim] I gave you that? - The most wonderful present I've ever had. - I can't remember a thing. - I love you. (romantic orchestral music) (jet overhead) - Are we ready? - Ready sir. - Computer. - Computer control. - That was great Mark, how does it feel? - Acceptability starts at six miles from destination. I'll take another ride, over. - Mark, can you hear me? - [Mark] Yes, dad. - No experiments, do you hear? Come in for an immediate landing. - Is that what you want? - I don't want him to risk his life, Leyton. - He knows what he has to do. - But that's my son up there. - Well, you wanted to keep it in the family. Besides, he's getting paid for it. - [Leyton] Increase velocity, zero one five. - Zero one five. - I'm losing control. Losing control. - Gentleman, let's break off the test, I think we've proved enough for one day. - Okay, break it off. - Terminated. - You did a good job my boy, I'm proud of you. I'm proud of the whole team. I'm only glad that the experiments came off without any accidents. Thank you. - Carstens wants to see you immediately in the computer room. We need all that information for the data bank. You okay? - [Mark] Sure. - Professor Handley, you have a telex from your son, Jim. - Thank you. - Bye bye, I enjoyed it. Hi, how are you? - Welcome to Hong Kong, Mister Handley. - Good to see you. - Thank you very much. - Fine. - [Announcer] All passengers for Alitalia flight A10-788 to Tokyo, departing from gate six. - Get in, I'll drive. - Okay. (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] Hong Kong, a strange city. The checkpoint charlie of the east. A melting point for all races. Sometimes friendly, sometimes vicious. Mecca for new forms of international high finance. The hub of international espionage. In this teaming city, east and west, so long estranged, mingle, and walk the streets in common groups. Vigilant, a city where a man could lose himself in pleasure, or find himself in pain and terror, a man like attache, Jim Handley. (speaking in foreign language) - We'll see you at the consulate at six. - Yeah, I'll be there. Thanks Meg, bye bye. - Bye Mister Handley. (birds singing) - Look, just because you're a woman, doesn't give you the right of way. - You promised this time I could be the admiral. - Hi Mom. Hello Dad. - Hello Mark. - Hi Mark. You know Jim has arrived in Hong Kong, he should be home in about 10 days. - Well, we must organize a marvelous party. He's been gone for over a year now. - Lucky for Jim, traveling all over the world at the expense of the government. - I don't see what the hell you've got to complain about. - Well, that's it Leyton, that's it. Again, we have proof that our calculations are correct. You know gents, we can look forward to this demonstration with a certain amount of optimism. - With this knowledge, we could save millions of lives, and maybe stop the wars. - What are you trying to do, wreck the economy? - What about the demonstration? - Everything is A-OK. - When are you gonna tell Dad? - Well, how about right now? - The brain creates electrical impulses that flow through the body by various channels. Memories are stored in the human brain, similar to a computer. And actually the human brain is much more versatile than any computer could ever be. Our invention enables us to interrupt any free train of thought. We can electronically control the thoughts by directly intercepting the electromagnetic waves. Bruno? - Thank you. Well, the brain in essence, the brain becomes the receiver, and when subjected to these influences is incapable of resisting control. Our device uses microelectronic technology. And through the automated control of the whole system, it can detect its own individual target, in this case a human being. Fire a pulse of information, and continue to bombard him until such time as he's under control. The distance to which the beam can be projected, well, depends on the power used. To give some idea of the time factor involved, without getting into theory, it would normally become effective at half the speed of light. Furthermore, these detectors are so sophisticated, they will only reflect the radiations from the human body, and nothing else. - If our installations are placed around the world, in all the most strategic positions, we would achieve maximum security. All we're doing here is to explain and demonstrate what we've developed through years of hard work. Now, it's up to the government to come to a decision. (tense orchestral music) (eerie orchestral music) - Are we ready? - Ready sir. - You can begin now, General. - Just give the orders, Bill. The drivers will do exactly as you tell them. - They won't hear your voice, but they'll obey anything that is transmitted to them electronically. - Stop. Drive on. - Now we'll switch over to a computer program. Computer. - Computer control. (tires screeching) (dramatic orchestral music) - March. - The machine makes them go on the defensive automatically, and against any target. They even think they're attacking tanks, not cars. - That's incredible. Pete, I'd say we've gone far enough. - Works to perfection. - Computer control. Terminate transmission. - [Technician] Terminated. - If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. - Well, that's over and done with. - You think the government will give us the go ahead? - Oh I think we've convinced them, thanks to you, Leyton. - So what's the problem? - Jim. - Excuse me, you are Jim Handley of the American Embassy? - What can I do for you? - I'm sorry to bother you, but there's something I have to discuss with you. Do you have a minute? It's so crowded here. Your apartment maybe? - Sure, come on up. Where'd you say we met? Come on in, sit down. - It's a long story, Mister Handley, and not really important. Just call me Lee. - What did you want to talk to me about? - The small package for me in your brief case. - Package? - Could I please have the combination? - I think this conversation's over, Lee. Out. Or I'll throw you out. - [Lee] The combination? Come on Mister Handley. - Two three five. But I keep all my important papers at the American consulate. - Thank you. I'm so glad everything is going according to plan. I am talking about confidential documents of NATO, and shipments of weapons to numerous countries, which you have been kind enough to deliver to us. - I've never seen those papers before in my life. - Oh, all that's irrelevant. As far as the organization is concerned, this is your last stopping place. Now, there's one final item which still has to be solved. As a member of the organization, you'll be safe, and this goes for your family in America as well, but you must understand that we'll be planning this very carefully. One word from us and your father, your brother, and your step-mother will be eliminated. Don't worry. Far more important people than you are involved. Surely you agree, both sides must be winners. All we need is your cooperation. Sign. - A fish factory, why? - Well in the first place, we get freedom of movement, and less chance of suspicion. - You mean, literally a red herring? - One of the company's ships, and we can achieve what we need with a minimum of security. - All right, when do we leave? - The night of the 22nd, from Boston. The Willem Barendsz is coming in from Portsmouth. - Great Britain? - You know how diversified the old man's business interests are. - Crew, what about crew? - Hand-picked and screened. - Data banks, computer? - You're in charge of the installation, you'd better start learning as soon as the ship comes in. - Hey, don't forget your golf clubs. - The company had very good reasons why we should leave Boston in the middle of the night. Mister van Dyk will explain. - Some things may happen during this trip. It will be difficult for you to understand. But I'm sure that if we work together, our mission will be accomplished. - [Captain] Gentlemen, to the trip. Good luck. - Good luck. (dramatic orchestral music) - Atanga. - How did you recognize me? - That's the only ring I've ever owned. Please, sit down. What are you doing in Hong Kong? - I love you, isn't that enough? What's the matter? - There's trouble, Atanga. And it's serious, and the worst of it is, for the first time in my life, I don't know what to do about it. - Do you mean here in Hong Kong? - No, I wish. No it's not only here. - Let's go to my apartment. - Yeah. - Jim, we must talk about it. Please tell me what's wrong. - I'm being blackmailed. - Why don't you go to the police? - I can't. I'm not the only one involved. The lives of my family are at stake. - Is there anything you can do? - Not at the moment. - Jim. What happens now? - Tomorrow, you fly back to Europe. I want you away from this mess. - Why don't you talk to the CIA? Or the consul? And if the consul can help you, maybe I can stay. - You don't understand Atanga. You'd be in danger with me now. Tomorrow, you leave Hong Kong. - Let's get going. (doorbell ringing) - Get dressed. - Yes. Yes. Thank you. Our Mister Handley is now safe. - Excellent, excellent. We must continue with our previous plans. We were discussing your department, Mister Burton. - Ah, well thanks to the information received from Brussels, we've decided to move the following shipment. Country A, 10,000 machine pistols, 1000 heavy machine guns, 500 bazookas, 10,000 hand grenades plus ammunition, et cetera. - And what is the situation with our friend in country B, Mister Vee? - Well amend their report that the government is very cooperative, but I do think they will need more supplies. Our representative there is in close contact with the leader of the opposition. - And what does the cooperation cost? - Oh, nominal. - Excellent, excellent. Shall we now discuss Mister Handley's situation? - Mister Handley, we would like to know a little bit more. - I don't know anything about an organization. - What did you want to talk to the CIA about? And what kind of advice did you want from your consul? - If there's gonna be any deal between us, the girl's out of it. She can't help you, let her go. - [Atanga] Jim. Jim. Jim. - Show yourselves you bastards. - It was stupid of you to confide in her. - I'm telling you she knows nothing. She's my business. - Mister Handley, she has become the business of the organization. And there is only one solution. My name is Wong, we already know each other. Atanga will have to die. It's only a formality, but it will be the proof that we can trust you implicitly. - That was stupid of you, Mister Handley. My men will kill you in exactly three minutes. And that's not all, your family in the United States will be eliminated. - World peace, bullshit. - Kill her man, and you save not only your life, but also the lives of your family. 30 seconds, Mister Handley. 15 seconds, Mister Handley. Five seconds, Mister Handley. Kill her. - Atanga. (machine guns firing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Mister Handley, our doctor knows his job. He's given you some drugs that will put you right in no time. - What do you want from me? - It's only a small matter, you might call it a favor. Your family is mixed up in a very unpleasant business. Mister Handley, please look at me. - The United States government has approved a test expedition to Australia, as proposed by the Handley Enterprise. One of Handley's ships is on its way there now. They say it is a test expedition, but a reliable source tells us that they are going to install a secret plant there. - Do you expect me to stop the expedition? - Not exactly, but try to persuade your father to delay the installation. - Betray my country. - Mister Handley, the Willem Barendsz has to be stopped, or we'll all be in trouble. - Then you'd better kill me. - It's quite harmless Mister Handley. You will have a high temperature tomorrow, that's all. - Pete, it's Jim. - What about him? - Dad, Lucie, please forgive me. Doctor Taylor, can you get him for me? - What's the matter, Jimmy? - Lucie, get Doctor Taylor, tell him it's urgent. - All right. - Can you pour me something Dad? A brandy. - [Doctor] Well, there's nothing wrong with your heart. - It's nothing really. A virus. - [Doctor] Well, you do have a temperature, Jim. Just stay in bed for a day or two. - Peter, I'm terribly worried about Jim. - Oh, I don't know dear, I think Jim is just overworked, that's all. I'm sure Doctor Taylor will have him on his feet in no time. - No, there's something else. Jim's changed. - But darling, everybody changes. (eerie orchestral music) (rock music) - Hey, hold on. My name is Warden, Doctor Warden. - How are you? I'm Jim Handley. That's a mighty nice horse you've got there. - Yeah, bought him in Kentucky about two years ago. Have you spoken to your father about the Willem Barendsz? - You boys are really dedicated, aren't you? I was wondering when you'd be contacting me. - Well, have you? - Listen Doctor Warden, I told the people in Hong Kong. My father has no influence at all, none whatsoever. - We know all about Hong Kong, Mister Handley. Meet me here tomorrow, and let me know what your father's answer is. - Thank you Alfred, that will be all for tonight. - Thank you madame, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight, Alfred. Do you realize what you're asking me to do? Anyway, the matter's entirely out of my hands. - I know, I know, it's in the hands of the Army. - Who put this nonsense into your head, anyway? - Jim is still convalescing Pete, he needs peace and quiet. - Why don't you tell me what's troubling you? I'll do anything I can to help you. - If you traveled the world as I do, and had to listen to what people say about our lovely country, and politics, it's enough to make you throw up. (clock chiming) - See you tomorrow, Jimmy. - Goodnight, Lucie. - You used to call her Mother. (phone ringing) Hello, Handley. - [Man On Phone] Could I please speak to Jim Handley? - Just a moment, I'll call him. - Jim, for you. - Thank you. Jim Handley here. - [Warden] Any news? - No. - [Warden] See you tomorrow at 10, Mister Handley. - Looking forward to the ride. - You know Mark has risked his life on these tests, to bring this project to a successful conclusion. I'm proud of you too, Jim. - And I hope I don't disappoint you, Dad. - Here are all the details. We're relying on you, Mister Handley. - How do you know the Barendsz is putting in at Cape Town? And how am I supposed to get on board? - You'll find a way I'm sure. Think of the people, and your brother on board. And keep it mind, if you fail, they are all in danger. The organization prefers no bloodshed, if possible. Good luck. - Now take your grip, stand here, take your grip. Left hand, left hand, that's it. Put this hand over the top, over the top now. Keep that stiff. Now when you make your swing, keep that stiff. Then you turn the body, go all the way down. That's it. You gotta keep your head down. Let me show you, here let me show you. We'll say it's out there, huh? US Open Championship or something, huh? Here we go. So right? Head down, right? - An urgent telegram's arrived, Captain. - Thank you, operator. - Please advise, James Handley, joining Barendsz, Cape Town, Handley Corporation. What does the old man think this is, a joy ride? Do you know Jim Handley? - Sure, I don't know what the hell he is doing in Cape Town though. - Well, he'll just have to share the cabin with his brother, that's all. (foghorn blasting) (siren sounding) (foghorn blasting) - I hope you'll be comfortable in your brother's cabin, Mister Handley. - Sure he will. - Once again, welcome aboard. - Thank you. - Jim? Good to see you. - How are you? - Welcome aboard. - Thank you, thank you. - Let's go Jim. - My permit, Captain. (foghorn blasting) - Why so serious? Aren't you pleased to see your brother again? - Half brother. - Half a brother is better than none. - Yeah your brother is happy to see you again. - That's good. - Good morning, have you anything to declare at all? - Nothing. - And you have anything to declare? - No. - Thank you. - Hold on to this while I get my key, huh? - Sure live in style. - Well, a diplomat has some good taste. How about a drink? - Okay. - Yeah, you got some parcels there. - From whom? - From Mother, who else? ♪ It is not too late ♪ ♪ The night is well up to you ♪ ♪ Will you wait with me ♪ ♪ What stands in our way ♪ ♪ When you stay with me ♪ ♪ The night is young I have you ♪ ♪ When you smile at me ♪ ♪ Tomorrow is all ♪ ♪ Always a wild chance ♪ ♪ Because I'm faithful to you ♪ - Jim? What's wrong Jim? In all the time I've known you, I've never seen you look so down. - That song, it reminds me of the worst experience of my life. - You want to talk about it? - No. - Now you've got to talk to somebody. Might as well be me. You want to start at the beginning? - Why don't we radio Handley, make a smooth turnaround and call the whole damn thing off? - No way. - Hey, do we really have to play at being heroes? - Look I'm just as much against any kind of violence as you are. - I know you are. Look, what the hell do we do? (speaking in foreign language) Leyton, the only suggestion I can make, is we set up the equipment and then keep a constant watch through the entire trip. - Look, you know as well as I do, that the assembly alone will take at least three weeks. (ominous orchestral music) - Mister Leyton van Dyk. - Huh? - Mister van Dyk? - Yeah, sure. (tense orchestral music) - [Operator] Operator. - Get me Leyton van Dyk please. (foghorn blasting) - [Leyton] What about Mark, do we tell him about Jim? - [Bruno] Not yet, he'd be upset. Try to contact his father. - All right, let's go skipper. - Yes sir. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Man On Phone] May I speak to Professor Handley please? - My husband hasn't come home yet. - [Man On Phone] Oh, Missus Handley? - Yes. - [Man On Phone] Missus Handley, as you know, Jim and Mark are at sea aboard the Willem Barendsz, but the journey is gonna come to a bad end. I strongly suggest you try to influence your husband to break off the expedition. - Has the decision been taken? - Not yet. - Hello, this is Professor Handley, let me speak to General Stryker. - [Man On Phone] I'm very sorry sir, but the General is not to be disturbed. - This is an emergency. - [General] What is it Pete? - Bill, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I just got a strange call about the Willem Barendsz, I think she may be in danger. - I know, I already had a call from van Dyk. - What can we do about it? - Pete, we have to take the risk of casualties. The mission will continue. Precautionary measures have already been taken. - [Man] This is repeat from General Stryker, strike force, mobilize. All messages received, and that's all from my side. Standing by on two one eight two. Over and out from my side, thank you. - Gentlemen, we have a problem. I've already contacted General Stryker, and help is available immediately. Now, here's the problem. - Thank you, sir. Men, that was command. There's a priority A mission, you know what that means? It's very dangerous. Logistically, there's no return from this operation. Our mission lies roughly in this area there. Our fuel will last just that long. So, the Navy will have to pick us up. I'll talk to you about the aim and the purpose of the operation later. - [Bruno] I think you'd better have another word with our playboy, see if he's given all the information. - [Leyton] I can try. Jim, you sure you told me everything in Cape Town? - Everything. Everything I know. - You're sure. - Sure. Leyton, what are we gonna do? - You do your duty, and I'll do mine. (ominous orchestral music) - What are you doing? - Looking for my camera. You were the last one to use it. - I'll get it. Next time ask. (speaking in foreign language) - JH one zero zero. JH one zero zero. Do you read me? - [Man On Radio] JH one zero zero, I can hear you, come in. - 0600 hours, everything okay, out. - [Man On Radio] JH one zero zero, understood, 0600 hours, over and out. - Good luck. - Let's go. - Professor Handley will be very proud of you, but I know I can count on every one of you. Now, on board the Willem Barendsz, we've got friends as well as enemies. Quite frankly, we don't know how to distinguish them. So, you'll have to watch carefully before you act. - That's not easy, shall we shoot first, sir? - Remember what I told you, follow me on the double. The other groups are already on their way. - Charlie, calling Bluebird, come in please. - [Man On Radio] Bluebird here, Bluebird here, Bluebird here, come in. - [Charlie] The Willem Barendsz should be taken to a secret area. We suppose that an enemy submarine will take instruments and scientists, after which, the Willem Barendsz will be sunk. Check position. - Roger, map reference, I spell tango zero foxtrot charlie, over. - My brother asked to be excused. He's a bad sailor. - Morning, Bruno. - Hello Mark. They're coming. - Jim, what are you doing? Bloody traitor, you pig. Jim, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Captain! Captain! Hey Bruno, help Bruno. - Keep him quiet. - Captain! Captain! - That's my brother. - Get him the hell out of here. - Jim? - Atanga? - Thank you for your cooperation. I didn't think it would go so well. This time Mister Handley, I can assure you the bullets are real. - Why? - Both sides must be winners. (rock music) - Stay on course. Radio room. - Where is Leyton van Dyk? Captain? Where is Leyton van Dyk? (phone buzzing) - Yes? - Engine room, all clear. - All right. - The ship's in our hands. - Thank you captain. You know the course. - Yes, madame. - Now, we wait for the submarine. - You, all of you, get in there. - Leyton, put on his clothes. Quick. - Hey, come here. - This is Lee speaking, you can approach now. - Good luck, we'll be at the rendezvous within an hour. - I hope the mines don't explode while we're still aboard ship. - Everything okay boys? - Yes. - You bitch. You blew it. - We're going in over the flight deck. - We are trapped. - What can we do? - We say the boat is coming to our aid. It can be here in half an hour. (explosion) - [Mark] Bruno, Leyton. - We're here Mark. - I heard them talking. They put explosives around the ship. Jim let the gang aboard. - I know, I know. You stay here. - Spread out, come on. - Jim. Jim. - He wasn't a traitor, Mark. I have many things to tell you. - We've got in here, what's the situation? - Well, there's explosives all over the hull. The other ones left are in the engine room. Come on. (helicopters running) - We should get away from here as fast as we can. - They expect us to help them. When the entire mission is completed, and all the instruments aboard the submarine, then we can leave. - Switch off the engines, and advise the bridge. We'll find the girl. - Hold it. - Wrench. - [Leyton] Come out of there. (sinister orchestral music) - [Man On Radio] XX four seven nine, XX four seven nine, executive fail safe. - Operator, tell them we got the message. - Are you Leyton van Dyk? - Not on board, why? - Tell Mister van Dyk that one day the organization will kill him. - Capitan, why do we kill our own people? - We have our orders. - We'd better get out of here. Otherwise we'll be next. - I'll inform the bridge, Mister van Dyk. - Do we continue the mission? - No. - Get out of here. (explosion) (fire burning) - That ring. You see that ring? - What about it? - It belonged to my family. My mother gave it to Jim. - 20 degrees starboard, doctor. - 20 degrees starboard. - Do you think that with our invention, we would succeed in making people more considerate, and more sensible? - No. They could have torpedoed us. Instead, they blew up their own side. That's how insane they are. We are. The game is. Nobody wins. Nobody wins anything. Those that don't die are crippled for life, in the flesh, or in the mind. And the game never ends. (dramatic orchestral music)
