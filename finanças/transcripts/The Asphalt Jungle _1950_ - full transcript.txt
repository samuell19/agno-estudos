Gus! - What time did this punk come in here? - Don't ask me. I don't watch the clock. I own the joint. - No gun. - I'll search the joint. - You got a warrant? - Now look, Gus, why don't you cooperate? - Get a warrant. - Take him in. - On what? - We'll book him on vag. All right, come on, you. Come on. Smith, Karl Anton, age 37. Arrested 6:00 PM last night. Phoned police station stating he had murdered Mrs. Kathryn Smith. Doldy, William, age 22.

Arrested 1937, illegal possession firearms. Sentence, one to five. Escaped state prison 1939. Arrested 1940, released 1941. That's enough. Well, do you see the man who pulled the stickup last night? I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? - He had a hat on. Put on your hats. Well? He was tall, you say. He had on a brown suit and a wide-brim hat. All right, don't you see him? Well, come on! Is that him? No, it isn't him. - Okay. - That's all. - Lieutenant Ditrich? - What is it? Commissioner wants to see you in his office right away. Sit down, Lieutenant. Thank you, sir. Thirty-nine thefts, 33 burglaries, 18 robberies, seven assaults, five morals offenses in the past 30 days. Quite a record, even for the Fourth Precinct, Lieutenant Ditrich. We know the guy who's been pulling most of the stickups, Commissioner. Name's Dix Handley. He was in the show-up this morning, but our witness got cold feet and backed down. - What can you do? - Lock up the witness! Scare him worse! It's your job knowing what to do. As things are, the only merchants safe from harm in your precinct are those who take wages on the horses. I want to know why those parlors are still operating. I close them down, but they only open up again. You don't close 'em hard enough! Rip out the phones! Smash up the furniture! People like to bet the horses, sir, and just because the law says no - I don't want your opinion of the law. - Is that all, sir? - No, that's not all. Where is Erwin Riedenschneider? - I'm waiting to hear on that, sir. - You don't know where he is? No, sir, but we ought to get word from our stoolies. It was all dumped in your lap. He left state prison yesterday at 12 noon, took a train for this city. Time of arrival, 3:17. All you had to do was spot him, stay with him for 24 hours. If he didn't register, lock him up. But what happens? He loses you five blocks from the depot. And one of the most dangerous criminals alive is now at large in this city. The two men on that detail ought to get medals for dumbness. They were assigned by you. You oughta get one too. Ditrich, I can do three things about you. I can reduce you to patrolman and send you down to Five Corners, I can bring you up for departmental trial on charges of incompetence, or I can give you one more chance to make good on your responsibilities. I think that'll be the greatest punishment of all. Thank you, sir. There's the number you're looking for. But it's dark. You want me to wait? I wouldn't go parading around this neighborhood with a suitcase. Some of these young punks might clip ya just to get a clean shirt. - Yeah? - I want to see Cobby. Who are you? Just say Doc is here and would like to see him. Wait here. You'd better be on the legit, pal. What do you got? Three threes. Well, where the devil is he? All right, make it fast. I'm a busy man. What do you want? - I just got out today. - Oh, so that's it. I'm tired of you guys that fell putting the bite on me. I'm no First National Bank. - I got a proposition for you. - All you guys have. - Maybe you didn't get who I was. - I never seen you before. - Come on, come on. What is it? - Maybe you've heard of me. The Professor? Or Herr Doktor, maybe. You mean, you are Riedenschneider? Well, why didn't you say so? Come on in, Doc. Come on in. Sit down, Doc. Sit down. - Have a drink? - Nothing to drink. I got out of the habit behind the walls. - That's all it is - a habit. - Well, here's to the drink habit. It's the only one I got that don't get me into trouble. Well, Doc, what's on your mind? I got a proposition. A big one. - How big is big? - Too big for you, Cobby. Now, wait, Doc. I don't like to brag, but I'm doing all right. Makin' book. I'm in the chips. - What kind of proposition is it? - A plan for a caper. And it's a good one. I could sell it for $100,000 on the open market, but that would be throwing money away. I prefer to execute it myself and make - - How much? - Half a million dollars. Maybe even more. Of course I will have to do a little checking, as the plan is some years old. But not much checking. Not much. I need roughly 50,000 to operate. Fifty thousand? No, no, no, I don't see. Of course. I thought maybe Mr. Emmerich. What do you know about Mr. Emmerich? Only what I heard in the walls - that he has money to invest and that the way to get to him is through you. Of course, if my information is not correct... Correct. Sure. Sure, it's correct. It's just that I never thought of Mr. Emmerich in connection with this kind of a deal. Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back. Hello? Thanks. See ya later. Hello, Dix. What do you want? - I wanna make a bet. - Well? - Your man says you got to okay it. - What are you in for? 2,300 and some. Okay. Your tab's good for 2,500. But that's the limit. Either pick a winner or pay me when you get that far. Don't bone me! - Now, look, I'm not boning - - Did I ever welsh? - Nobody said you did. - You just boned me. - Look, Dix - - I'm not asking you any favors. I'll go get you your 2,300 right now. Now, Dix. Now, Dix, listen. Will you have a drink? Come on. Dix, come back here. Have a drink. Can you beat that? - Where does he come off blowing a fuse? - Who is he? A small-time hooligan who's crazy for horses. My book beats him and beats him, he keeps coming back for more. Say, Doc. I forgot on account of that big tramp. I spoke to Mr. Emmerich on the phone. He's gonna meet us later on tonight. He's giving a dinner party at his house in town for a bunch of swells, but he'll be at another address later on. A man like Emmerich has got more than one place to hang his hat. Smart cat. Never does a lick of work, stays out all night, sleeps all day. What's a big, dirty cat doing at an eating joint? I run over one every time I get a chance. People feeding cats, and some kids haven't got enough to eat. You gonna buy that magazine? Why should I? I seen all the dames in it already. Wanna make something of it? You're a little off your beat, ain't you, buster? - How do you mean, Humpty Dumpty? - I mean, you don't belong around here. You're just passing through. Only not fast enough. If I ever see you running over a cat, I'll kick your teeth out. I'd take you apart if you were about a foot taller and straightened up a little. Suppose you want your heater back. Well, you ain't gonna get it. What do you think of that? - Quit kidding, Gus. - I mean it. Go on, get sore. Smack me down. You know I wouldn't do that. Look, Dix, take my advice and knock off for a while. The happiness boys are on a rampage. Headquarters has given them the push. - I can't afford to knock off. - Oh, stop worrying. I'll stake you. - Yeah? I need 2,300. - What? - Something I just gotta take care of. - Cobby, maybe? Well, let him sweat. It'll do him good. Cobby can spare a few pounds. You can't owe money to a guy like him, a little loudmouth who bones you when he isn't even trying to. I don't get you, Dix. I just can't be in Cobby's debt and keep my self-respect. Oh. All right. I got a grand put away. You can have that. Maybe I can dig up 1,300 more. - I guess it's all right to owe me, huh? - I guess. Yeah. It's just my luck. Well, I'll get it tomorrow or bust a gut. In the meantime, stay away from the boulevard, especially at night. By the way, they knocked over that clip joint, the Club Regal. - Wasn't that where Doll worked? - Yeah. - It's coming in bunches, it looks like. - Yeah. Go home, Dix. Stay home. Yeah. Don't get your flag at half-mast. Remember, you still got old Gus. Thirteen hundred? You must be crazy. For Dix? What do I care for that hooligan? I'd like to help you out, Gus, but I got mouths to feed and rent to pay and all that stuff. You great big, fat Italian - Why don't you wise up, you wise guy? - You're a low-down scum. - Shh! A low-down, dirty scum to talk to me like that. Look, Gus. I guess I can make it, all right. - Yeah? - Dix, it's me, Doll. Doll? Hi, honey. Come on in. - Close the door. - Well, sure, Dix. Sure. I'm awful sorry to bother you, honey, but... Doll, if you're gonna smoke, you gotta learn to carry matches. Doll, what are you crying about? N-Nothin', Dix. Nothing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dix. I don't know what I was thinking about, bothering you at this time of the night. I'll just run along. Gus told me the Club Regal got knocked over. Yeah. Can you imagine, raiding the Regal? The cops must have all gone crazy. So it's a clip joint. So what? And it would have to happen on pay night. - How about a drink? - Hey, I don't care if I do. One of my eyelashes is coming off. Were you, uh, locked out of your room? How'd you guess? Well... here's how. Uh, Dix, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, could I stay here a couple of days? Just a day or two. All right. Stay if you want to. But don't you go getting any ideas, Doll. Everything is here, from the observed routine of the personnel to the alarm system, the type of locks on doors, the age and condition of the main safe and so forth and so forth. Take my word for it, Mr. Emmerich. This is a ripe plum ready to fall. My friend, according to the boys, all takes are easy. But as a lawyer, I've made a lot of money getting them out of jail. Please, Mr. Emmerich. Perhaps you know my reputation. I've engineered some very big things. That's a fact, Mr. Emmerich. Doc here is tops. Am I to understand you gathered this information before doing your last stretch? - That is correct. - I was ready to begin operations, and the coppers grabbed me for an old caper I'd almost forgotten about. The Adelphia Finance caper. You took 'em for 160,000, didn't you, Doc? A hundred and fifty-eight. And you really believe there's a million in this thing? Maybe even more. You mean by that that the take will be worth half a million to us in actual cash? Because you know as well as I do that in no case will a fence give you more than 50 percent. That's right, sir. - Well, what are your main problems? - There are three. Money to operate, personnel, and finally, the disposing of the take. No trouble about the first, eh, Mr. Emmerich? Wait a minute, Cobby. This remains to be seen. The helpers will be paid off like house painters. They'll be told nothing about the size of the take. Sometimes men get greedy. - Well, how many helpers do you need? - Only three. A box man. Him, we pay most. Maybe $25,000. I got a guy for you. Louis Ciavelli. Best box man west of Chicago. Expert mechanic. Been in some very big capers. From what I hear, he can open a safe like the back of a watch. Only, he costs. Then we need a top-notch driver, in case of a rumble. - He should get 10,000. - Mm-hmm. Finally, sad to say, we need a hooligan. Most of these fellas are drug addicts. They're a no-good lot, or they wouldn't be hooligans. Violence is all they know, but they are, unfortunately, necessary. For a more or less reliable man, I'd say 15,000. Mm-hmm. Well, that's 50,000 in all. How, uh - How's this take to be handled? We'll get in touch with the best fences in the Midwest and deal with whoever makes the highest offer. Maybe no one fence can handle the whole thing. In that case, we deal with two or three. Half a million, eh? I, uh... I'm, uh... I'm just thinking. If I decide to go into this thing, I, uh... I, myself, I might handle the... You, a fence, Mr. Emmerich? Oh, no, no, Cobby. Not exactly. But your proposition looks pretty good. I'd like to see the most made of it. Oh, I suppose a fella should stick to his own trade, but, uh, I know some pretty big men around here that might not be averse to a deal like this, if they're properly approached. Highly respectable men, I might add. So why don't you let me see what I can do before you look for a fence, hmm? A few days, more or less, wouldn't make much difference to you, I don't suppose. - Might mean a lot more money for all of us. - Good. There's just one thing. I dislike to mention it, but I've just come from prison and... Oh. Well, of course. Cobby will advance you anything you need, see that you have a place to stay. - Eh, Cobby? - Well, you bet your life. And I got some fancy phone numbers for you too, Doc. What's it like, a man of your taste, seven years behind the walls? Not too bad. It's a matter of temperament. I cause no trouble. The prison authorities appreciate that. They made me assistant librarian. I'm afraid I wouldn't make a model prisoner. After this job, it's Mexico for me. I'll live like a king. Mexican girls are very pretty. I'll have nothing to do all day long but chase them in the sunshine. - You've been very kind, sir. - Good night. Good night. - Mr. Emmerich. - Cobby. What's the big idea, standing there staring at me, Uncle Lon? Don't call me "Uncle Lon." I thought you liked it. Maybe I did. I don't anymore. I had the market send over some salt mackerel for you. I know how you love it for breakfast. Some sweet kid. It's late. Why don't you go to bed? Some sweet kid. Hello, Bob Brannom? This is Emmerich. No, no. I didn't call you to get the right time. Listen, I've got a job for you. No, no. Nothing like that. I've got over $100,000 standing out on my books. Come to my office tomorrow morning, I'll give you a list of people that owe me. No, no, no, no. Use the method called for in each particular case. And don't tell me anything about it. All I want is results. So what? Easy, boy. Easy. Hello. Who? Oh, sure, Gus. He's still asleep. What? Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him. Honey. Honey, that was Gus. He says you can come over anytime. He's got something for you. Okay. Coffee, honey? I made it fresh. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, you sure were dreaming. How do you know? You were talking in your sleep. - What was I saying? - It was all jumbled up. But I heard one word real plain. You called it out several times. "Corn cracker." What's that mean? Corn Cracker? Corn Cracker was a colt. Yeah, it would be. Yeah. He was a tall, black colt. Yeah, I remember what I was dreaming. I was up on that colt's back. My father and my grandfather were there, watching the fun. That colt was buck-jumping and pitching. Once he tried to scrape me off against the fence, but I stayed with him, you bet. Then I heard my granddaddy say, "He's a real Handley, that boy. A real Handley." And I felt proud as you please. Did that really happen, Dix, when you were a kid? Not exactly. The black colt pitched me into a fence on the first buck. My old man come over, prodded me with his boot and said, "Maybe that'll teach you not to brag about how good you are on a horse." It's nice to hear you laugh. You know something? One of my ancestors imported the first Irish thoroughbred into our county. - Is that a fact? - Sure. Why, our farm was in the family for generations. One hundred sixty acres. Thirty in bluegrass and the rest in crops. Fine barn and seven brood mares. - Sounds wonderful, Dix. - It was. And then everything happened at once. My old man died, and we lost our corn crop. That black colt I was telling you about, he broke his leg and had to be shot. That was a rotten year. I'll never forget the day we left. Me and my brother swore we'd buy Hickorywood Farm back someday. Growing up in a place and then having to leave must be awful. I never had a proper home. Twelve grand would have swung it, and I almost made it once. I had more than $5,000 in my pocket and Pampoon was running in the Suburban. I figured he couldn't lose. I put it all on his nose. He lost by a nose. Drink your coffee, honey, before it gets cold. The way I figure, my luck's just gotta turn. One of these days, I'll make a real killing. Then I'm gonna head for home. First thing when I get there, I take a bath in the creek and get this city dirt off me. - What's the matter? - Nothing, Dix. Nothing. Nothing. - I say something wrong? - No. But, gee, this place is a mess. It needs a good cleaning. How can you stand to live like this? Count it. Count it. You don't have to pay the whole tab at once. Go ahead and count it. Why get sore? There's no reason to get sore. You boned me in front of a stranger, trying to make me look small. I didn't mean it. I shoot my mouth off. Maybe I had a slight load on. - You know how it is. - No. No, I don't know how it is. Look, Dix. I made a mistake. Don't you ever make a mistake? Sure. Sure. Here, have a drink. Here you are. There you are, Dix. You know, Dix, you gotta play the horses the smart way. Save your money. The next time there's a fix going, I'll let you know. It'll be money from home. Money from home. Excuse me. Oh, it's the Doc. Come on in, Doc. Want you to meet a friend of mine. Dix Handley. This is Doc Riedenschneider. - You heard of him, I guess, huh? - Yeah. Well, how'd you like the whiskey? Made in your home state. Oh. Where is that, sir? Kentucky. Boone County, Kentucky. - Best water in the USA. - Is that so? Yeah, it's the water makes the whiskey fit to drink. Well... I gotta be going. I'll see you around sometime maybe. So long, Dix. Whew. Big hick. The color of his money's all right, but I wish he wasn't so touchy. Maybe it's a point of honor with him. A gambling debt. Him? That hooligan? Honor? Don't make me laugh. - He's a hooligan, you say? - Yeah, but a small-timer. He'll stick up cigar stores, gas stations. And every cent goes to the ponies. One way or another, we all work for our vice. What do you say, Doc? How was your date last night? The young lady drank too much to be good company. But the evening wasn't a complete loss. She talked more than if she'd been sober. - Yeah? What about? - Your friend Mr. Emmerich. Emmerich? Now, look here, Doc. There's half a million at stake. I've got to know where I stand. Emmerich must put up before I can hire a crew. For him, it's nothing. A dead cinch. The information she gave me is that he's broke. Are you crazy? I've seen Mr. Emmerich operate for 20 years. He handles only the biggest cases. He's got two houses, four cars, a half a dozen servants. - And one blond. - Doc! Whose word you gonna take? Mine or some dim-witted dame? Yours, naturally. If he's broke, I wanna be broke the same way. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! That guy you saw in my office, he's just passing through. Shut up. I didn't see anybody. How could I? I wasn't here. Yeah, that - that's right. That's right. - Look, uh... - Yeah? I just came to tell you that, uh, you'll have to stand still for a raid. You mean you have to haul me downtown and book me? - It's a short ride. - I thought you were a friend of mine! Right now I've got one friend - Ditrich. And Ditrich's going to be out on his ear if he don't make a showing. - All right, but why me? Why pick on me? - Because it's logic. You're the biggest parlor in my precinct. The citizens know it, the newspapers know it, and even I know it. And that Mr. Commissioner knows I know it. I just hate to have it happen. I just hate it, that's all. - I'm as sorry as you are. - Look, Lieutenant. I've always given you plenty of cooperation. But you're hitting me at just the wrong time. Well, all right. Close up tight. Keep the place dark. Don't answer any phones. Thanks, Lieutenant. Thanks. That copper, he recognized me. - How'd you know he was a copper? - I can smell one a block off. Don't worry about Ditrich. He's on my payroll. Practically a partner. Me and him, we're like that. Experience has taught me never to trust a policeman. Just when you think one's all right, he turns legit. - A Mr. Brannom is here. - Oh, yes, show him in. Pardon me, sir. Mrs. Emmerich is not feeling well. Yes, well, send for Dr. Houseman. - I already have, sir. - Good. Tell her I, uh... Say I'll be up to see her later. Well, what about my debtors? How many of them came through? - Not a one. - What's that? You want all the excuses? I've got some beauts. As bad as that, eh? Two or three may come through with a part. They promised. I don't want promises. I want cash. Look, my friend, a private detective can't go around threatening people. I'd lose my license. Ninety-eight percent of them you're gonna have to sue. There's no time for that. I... I gotta have money. I gotta have it this minute. What is it? Girl trouble? Shut up, Brannom! That's not funny. How's that? Nobody tells me to shut up. I'm sorry, Bob. Bob, I... I'm broke. There. Th-That's the plain, simple fact. I'm finished. I'm bankrupt. How could you let a dame like Angela take you this way? It's not Angela. It's everything. It's my whole way of life. Every time I turn around, it costs thousands of dollars - 10,000 here, 10,000 there. I got... I gotta get out. I gotta get out from under. And the irony of it is that I've got an opportunity and I can't take it. Tough. Bob. I'm gonna hand you the shock of a lifetime. Did you ever hear of Doc Riedenschneider? Sure. Behind the walls, isn't he? No, he's out. He got out last week. Cobby brought him to me. He's got a plan, beautifully worked out, for the biggest caper ever to be pulled in the Middle West. Only he wants $50,000 backing. Who would be taken? Belletier's. The rocks alone would be worth, conservatively speaking, half a million. - How much would you get out of it? - A third of the take. Brother. You're knocking me out. What if I were to tell you that I've got a plan worked out to get it all? I could tell them that I'd fence the stuff myself, you see? Promise them cash on delivery. Then... when the time comes, I simply wouldn't have the cash. You understand? I'd tell them it'd take a few days more to raise it. I'm certain I could get them to leave the stuff with me while we're waiting. - Go on. - Well, then I'd disappear. I'd take a plane to another country, to another life. The gold and platinum I could melt up and sell as bullion, you see. And the rocks, sell them one at a time. There'd be no hurry. They'd last a lifetime. How wrong can a guy be? Here I was worrying about your nerves, and you were dreaming up a double-cross like this. Yes. But I can't do it because I haven't got $50,000. - I can tell you how to raise it. - You? How? - What's in it for me? - Fifty-fifty. Okay. But we may get ourselves killed, my friend. Yes, I - I know. - Well, how do we raise the money? - Simple. Cobby. - Cobby. - Believe me. He can dig it up without half-trying. Yes. But what do we tell him? Why do I need money? Leave it to me. Cobby wants to feel big. Here's his chance. Advancing money for the great Alonzo P. Emmerich. Ah, he'll do it. He'll sweat, but he'll do it. What boxes have you opened? Cannonball. Double door. Even a few fire chests. All of them. Can you open a vault with a time lock and a relocking device? - Sure. - What do you use, lock or seam? - Seam. - Ever taken one? - Remember the Shafter job? - Yes, I heard about it behind the walls. It was a good score. - Who supplies your soup? - I thrash it myself. - How are you as a picklock? - I can open anything in four minutes. - He'll do. - You're in. Not so fast. What's the cut? No cut. You get a flat guarantee. - I want 30,000. - Thirty thousand? Now, Louis - Twenty-five is what we figured. - All right, 15 down. - Ten down. Fifteen is satisfactory, I think. There's your paymaster. What are you sweating for? Money makes me sweat, that's all. It's the way I am. - Who are the others on this job, Doc? - Haven't got them yet. There's only one driver, as far as I'm concerned - Gus Minissi. Ask Cobby. He knows him. - Gus? Hundred percent. - Get hold of him. - He'll take the heat and won't flap his lip. - Get hold of him. Sure, Doc. Any ideas about a hooligan? I know a very good heavy. I haven't seen him in some time. Red Traynor. - He's taking the cure. - Rule him out. - What about Timmons? - Who's that? - My doorman. - That busted-down wrestler? Are you kidding? He's got nothing upstairs but solid knuckle. I'm a stranger and do not know as much as you gentlemen. But what about this Southerner, this Dix? He impressed me as a very determined man and far from stupid. Frankly, I don't like the guy, but I never saw a hooligan I did like. They're like left-handed pitchers. They all have a screw loose somewhere. I suppose he's as good as anybody though. Gus thinks he's tops, and Gus is usually right. I like him. I say we take him. Suits me. You're the boss. Well, I better be getting home now. Mrs. Ciavelli's worried about the kid. - What's the trouble? - Oh, he's got a cold again. She takes him out first thing in the morning. It's cold then. She claims a baby's gotta taste fresh air. Like I'm always telling her, "If you want fresh air, don't look for it in this town!" Here. He's nine months old there. I must say, I envy you being a family man. Yeah. Well, always problems, huh? One good thing about Dix Handley - you can get him for nickels and dimes. Tell me something, Cobby. It's your money, isn't it? Not Mr. Emmerich's. - What difference does it make? - None, really. It's this way. Mr. Emmerich doesn't want this transaction appearing in his books. I'm not risking anything. He's good for it in case of a runout. Then you haven't got a worry? No. - Where are you going? - I found a place. Girlfriend of mine's leaving town, and she's letting me have her apartment. The rent's paid up till the first of the month. When did all this happen? This morning, before you woke up. I bumped into her on the street. Remember that tall brunette, used to do the novelty dances at the Bandwagon? Blanche La Rue. It sure was nice of her. I can't go living off you forever, can I? - I was glad to help out. - Yeah. Well, maybe I can do something for you sometime. You don't owe me a thing. Forget it. Well... good-bye. - How are you fixed for dough? - A couple of bucks. Enough. Here, take this and - No. No, thanks, Dix. I'm all through bothering you. Give us a kiss, huh? Doll. Yes, Dix? Maybe I'll wanna get in touch with you. Oh. Oh, sure, my new address. I'll be at 42 Merton Street. 42 Merton. - Hello. - Hello, Dix? - Yeah. - Dix, this is Cobby. - Oh. How are ya, Cobby? - I got your number from Gus. - Yeah. - Look, Dix. Do you want to get into something big? I mean, real big. If you do, be at Gus's tonight at 10:00. Right. Everything's here. The soft spot's an old steam tunnel. Manhole's on the corner. You drop into the manhole at 11:45. Dix will cover you. You break through the wall. It'll take about six minutes to get into Belletier's from the furnace room. Watch out for floor wires. Make your way up the back stairs and jump the alarm system. That'll take another three minutes. At exactly 11:54, Dix and I will come to the back door. You open it for us. - I'll be waiting for you. - Good. Any questions? - Everything sounds okay. - Same here. Well, guess I better be getting home. - How's the boy? - Oh, he's okay. Ran a temperature yesterday. Pretty high too. We called the doctor, but temperatures don't mean so much with kids. He's back to normal today. - See you tomorrow night, 11:30. - Good night. Have you got a minute, Dix? Sure. What's on your mind? My friend, what do you know about this fellow Emmerich? You mean the big fixer? I've heard his name, that's all. - I can talk to you, I think. - Sure. Mr. Emmerich is taking the jewelry off our hands. You sure are surprising me, Doc. I don't exactly trust Mr. Emmerich. It's just a feeling. I may be wrong. But it's up to us to collect, you and me. Everything may go smooth, but if it don't... - If he's got it, we'll collect. - Good. We'll meet Mr. Emmerich after the caper, deliver the jewelry and get our money. The payment is to be immediate and in cash. After that, we pay off and scatter. Don't worry, Doc. We'll collect. Lon. Is that you? - Lon! - Yes, May. Come in, Lon. - I've got a business appointment. - Sit down a minute. It's 11:30. Isn't that rather late for business? - Lon. - Yes, May? I'm not feeling well. My dear, you haven't been feeling well for a long time. At night, I get nervous. And when I get nervous, I hate to stay in this big house all by myself. Look here. May, you're not here alone. There are three servants in the house. - All you have to... - I know. Press a button. Well, what do you want me to do? Sit down, Lon. All right. Do I sit here and watch you read a magazine? - Would that be so awful? - Oh, now, look, May - We could play cards. - Casino, like we used to. - Some other night. Please, Lon, just one hand. I couldn't sleep last night. Then I got to thinking of the old days, how we used to like to stay up and play casino, just the two of us. Yes. I-I wish I could stay, but I can't. My dear, this is business. Uh, I tell you what I'll do. I'll look in later, and if you're still awake, we'll have a little game. Take your keys, please. We're closing up. Okay. - All set? - Yeah. Better be careful how you handle this stuff. They'll pick you up in little pieces. What time have you got? Good. Good luck, Doc. Did he give you the soup? Here's the electric eye. Soup. It's gonna take a lot to blow this baby. Here goes. - What's that? - Keep going. Hey, Doc, alarms are going off all over the block. The blast must've shook up the whole system. - What do we do? - I would hate to leave now. We're so close. - I'm for finishing what we started. - How about you, Louis? - It's okay with me. - Will Gus hold still? Don't worry about Gus. What's the matter? The drill broke. We should finish before 12:15, before the watchman gets here. The store cop? Let me worry about him. - Hear that, Dix? - Yeah. - Coming this way? - From the river. Don't sound good. Dix, take a look, see what's happening. - We gotta blow, fast! - This is everything of real value. - Heavy, ain't she? - Plenty. This is the biggest one yet. Wait till you see it in the papers. Watchman. Pull open the door, Louis. - Maybe he'll go away. - Do what Dix says. Now. Follow me. - Gus, take me home. - Where'd it get you? In the thigh. I feel it going up. Think I got the slug in my belly. I'll take you to a guy, used to be a doctor. No, take me home, Gus. Take me home. All right, Louis. It's after 1:00. They should be here any minute. Unless there's been trouble. Where's Angela tonight? Hmm? Oh, she's at her sister's. She says. I'd go easy on that liquor if I were you. Half-drunk, I got better wits than most people. And more nerve. You look worried, my friend. Something bothering you? Ah, live and learn. All these years, I've been suffering from an inferiority complex. I should've been in the money years ago. You big boys, what have you got? Front. Nothing but front. And when that slips - I do believe our guests are arriving. Well, everything go all right? This is a friend of mine, Mr. Brannom. He's been a great help to me on this deal. Follow me. Follow me, gentlemen. It's much more comfortable in here. Say, I'll bet that thing is full of koh-i-noors and Grand Moguls, eh? Could be. Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down. - Let me get you a drink. - No, thanks. - Do you mind if we have a look? - You're entitled to a look, naturally. - Convinced? - Why, of course. Of course. There never was any doubt in my mind. I know this fellow's reputation. Just a matter of curiosity, that's all. I'll bet the appraisal is going to exceed even your estimate. Good, good. In that case, I'd just like to see the color of your money. Gentlemen, I must admit at this moment, I, uh - I'm embarrassed. You mean you haven't got the money, Mr. Emmerich? Oh, I have it. That is, I have the assurance of it. You haven't got it. No, I haven't got the currency right here in my hands. But it's promised by an unimpeachable source. Gentlemen, I'm afraid we were a little hasty. We, uh - We moved too fast. - We moved on your word. - Well now, wait a minute. That's a large sum of money, you know, considering present-day conditions, and considering the fact that we had to have it in cash. So I'm afraid a few days more are needed to raise it. A few days more may not seem like a very long time to you, Mr. Emmerich. But to me, carrying this around, it would seem like years. I understand. I've got a solution for that too. That is, if you boys trust me. And if you don't, well, there's nothing I can say except that I'm, uh, sorry. Mr. Emmerich, what are you trying to tell us? About the jewels. Wouldn't be safe for you to carry that stuff around. You said so yourself. You mean, we leave them with you? Well, now, look here. When the police start looking for that stuff tomorrow morning, they're not likely to call me up. They're not likely to send detectives out to search my house, you know. You, on the other hand, Doc, you, uh - you're just out of prison. They're certainly gonna be looking for the big-timers like yourself. Some smart cop might even connect this burglary with your release. Well, th-there you are. Of course, as I said, y-you - it's up to you. You can keep in touch with me through Cobby. You did a great job, Emmerich, but it's not workin'. - Bob! - Back away and keep out of this. Now, you, farmer, get your hands up. And you, Fritz... throw the bag on the floor. Over here, by my feet. Be careful how you throw it. I got a pistol expert medal. - What do you say, Dix? - He's got no say. He makes a crooked move, he'll never pitch another forkful of manure. He's got us, Doc. Toss him the bag. You're not as dumb as you look. Are you a man or what? Trying to gyp and double-cross me with no guts for it. What's inside of you? What's keeping you alive? Why don't you kill me? - What's stopping you? - Okay, mister - Dix, listen to me. Don't kill him. It's too easy an out for him. Sit down, sir. Whatever possessed you to pull such a stunt? I wa - I was broke, facing bankruptcy. He's a witness. You think he wouldn't holler if they turned the heat on him? He's in no position to talk. What did you and your man there intend to do with the jewels? Leave town. Sell them off a little at a time. No good. The police would have been on you after the first sale. You can't go peddling stuff like this around when the heat's on. Let's blow, Doc. Let's not fool around here any longer. Be patient, Dix. Mr. Emmerich got us into this hole, and he's going to get us out. I didn't save your life because I'm a lover of humanity. We're in trouble with this satchel full of jewels. As things stand, it's just so much junk. - There's nothing I can do. - Yes, there is, Mr. Emmerich. You can go to the insurance company. - Insurance company? - They'll listen to reason. This is a very bad jolt for them, and it's possible they'll be willing to buy the jewels back, no questions asked, for as high as 25% of what they're worth. Doc, let's blow. I'll start on it tomorrow. Get busy, Emmerich. And remember, you might have been lying here dead with your friend. Shall I get in touch with you through Cobby? No. I'll get in touch with you. Come on, Dix. I advise you to clean up after your friend. - Don't give him any water. - He asked for it. - I said don't give him any water. - Let go. You wanna kill him? Maybe he's hurt in the stomach. Where's the doctor? Why doesn't he come? You said ten minutes. It's half an hour. Louis'll die. Why can't I take my Louis to the hospital? They wheel him into an operating room, you'll never see him again. Take it easy, Maria. Louis's gonna be all right. The doctor will fix him up good as new. You and Louis are gonna have six more kids. All as fat as pigs, big black eyes, lots of hair. Just like Louis, eh, Maria? Stay away from the baby! Tell me the truth. How did it happen? - A fight. - Louis don't fight. You know that. All right. Why is it always you? Whenever Louis gets into trouble, you're around. You dirty cripple! You crooked back! - You have the evil eye! - Shut your mouth, Maria! I don't let anybody say that to me. I'm sorry, Gus, but I gotta blame somebody. What I carry on my back, I was born with it. I didn't grow it myself. Please forgive me, Gus. I didn't mean it. - Listen to that. - Yeah. Must be a fire. It's not in this neighborhood though. Someplace else. Oh, Gus. I pray to God that doctor get here quick. Aw, he'll be here any minute, Maria. Sounds like a soul in hell. Dix, why don't you get in touch with Gus and let him take you to that doctor. Don't be foolish. I don't like doctors. I'm getting along all right. That bullet just ripped through my side and went on about its business. - Good thing I jumped. - How can things go so wrong? How is it possible? One man killed, two others plugged. I'm out 30 grand. We got a load of rocks we can't even peddle. Why don't you quit cryin' and get me some bourbon. Aw... I must be awful stupid. Here I am with a good business, money rolling in. I-I gotta get mixed up in a thing like this. I ought to have my head examined. Yeah, hello, hello. Yeah, this is Cobby. What? It's Gus. Dragnet's out, and they're combing the district. He wants to talk to you. You, Dix. - Gus? Dix. - Yeah, now listen careful, pal. The cops are knocking over joints along the boulevard, meat wagons and all. Now, look. I already called a guy, Eddie Donato. Donato's got a grocery down by the river. 116 Front Street. - You got that? - Yeah. - Okay. - Thanks, Gus. How's Louis? Not so good. He got a slug in his belly. Doc's doing all he can. Yeah, here they are now, the happiness boys. Hello. How are you? Looks like I'm in for a working-over. Go down to Eddie's by way of the old car barn. It's deserted at night. Once you get beyond that, you're okay. The cops never bother Eddie's neighborhood. So long, Dix. Blow now, huh? All right, all right, all right. What? Uh, please, talk a little louder. This is Eddie Donato. Oh, sure, sure. I'll get-a Doc for you. Hey, dottore, I got your man. Hello? Yes. Fine, fine. Good. That'll be satisfactory. - Cobby? - Yes. Emmerich came through. The insurance people say okay. Of course, we'll have to wait till the banks open Monday morning, but it's 250,000, which is not bad. What's the matter? As a lawyer, you may be very brilliant, Lon, but as a casino player, you have a lot to learn. - Yeah. You don't mind if I smoke, do you? - Of course not, Lon. - Oh, here. - Lon. How could you make a play like that? You won't make a single point this hand. Oh. - Come in. - Two gentlemen to see you, sir. They are from the police department. What on earth could they want, Lon? Oh, something to do with a case, I suppose. - Excuse me? - Oh, bother. We were having so much fun. - Hurry back. - Sure. - Yes? - Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Emmerich. I'm Andrews. This is Officer Janocek. - How do you do? - How are you? Well, uh, what can I do for you? Do you know a man named Robert Brannom? Brannom. Yes, of course. What is it? Something the matter? There sure is, Mr. Emmerich. His body was pulled out of the river this morning. - Great heavens. - But it was no drowning. He had a hole through his pump. He'd been shot. Will you, uh, step in here for a minute? Well, I must say, this is, uh - It's quite a shock. Bob Brannom, eh? Murdered, you say? Great heavens. We found a list of names in his pocket written on your business stationery. - Who are these people, do you know? - Oh, that's a list of my debtors. Brannom was working for me. He was trying to collect some old debts. Without much success, I must say. Was he giving the treatment to anybody on this list? "Giving the treatment"? Certainly not. You don't think there's any connection between this work he was doing for you and his death? - None whatever. - When did you see him last? Well now, last Wednesday evening in this room. Yes. We went over that list together. Mm-hmm. The coroner says he was plugged about 1:00 or 2:00 this morning. Not much after the Belletier job was pulled. We figure there might be a connection. One of the heist guys was shot. We know that. There was blood on the floor. Maybe it was Brannom's. He could've died in the getaway car and the others dropped him in the river. Oh, no, no, no. Bob Brannom's a good deal of a roughneck, but he's no criminal, and if I'm any judge, Belletier's was the work of big-time professionals. Oh, no, no, gentlemen. Bob Brannom mixed up in any burglary. Why, that's inconceivable. I see. Oh, uh, one more thing, Mr. Emmerich. Just for the record, of course. Could you give us an account of your whereabouts last night? Yes, I could. Why? Is it necessary? I'm afraid so, Mr. Emmerich. Well, boys, a man of my years hates to make an admission like this, but a Miss Phinlay is living in my cottage on the river. And last night, I went to visit her at about, uh, 11:30, I think it was. Stayed rather late. Oh, she'll verify this, of course. Oh, but, boys - use a little discretion, eh? Unless, of course, it serves some useful purpose. I understand, Mr. Emmerich, and thank you very much for your help. Not at all. Thank you. If I can be any further help, you just call on me. - Good day. - Good day. - Hello, Angela? - Yes. - This is Lon. - Uncle Lon, why haven't you called? Listen, baby, you may have a visit from the police. - Is it your wife? - No, no. No, it's nothing like that. They'll probably ask you some questions about last night. Now, listen, baby. I want you to tell them that I was there with you from, uh, 11:30 until 3:00 in the morning. - That's most of the night. - Most of the night. That's right. - Now, is that clear? - Sure, it's clear. Yes. Oh, no, no. Just politics, baby. - Good old dirty politics. - All right. Call me right away. Yes. Yes, I'll call you later. - Don't forget. - Yes. Can we go on playing? Certainly. Why not? Why, Lon, you're as pale as a ghost. What's the matter? Oh, I - Well, I just had some bad news. A man who works for me got killed. Oh, Lon, how awful. Was it an accident? No. No, it was, uh, an intentional killing. - Do they know who did it? - No. Oh, Lon, when I think of all those awful people you come in contact with - downright criminals - I get scared. Oh, there's nothing's so different about them. After all, crime is only... a left-handed form of human endeavor. - Ever been in Mexico City, Dix? - Nope. It's 8,000 feet up. The air is very pure. Many first-class clubs and restaurants, a horse track and girls. Beautiful young girls. How would you like to go there, all expenses paid? Sorry, Doc, not interested. I'm headin' home. Listen, Dix. You can always go home. And when you do, it's nothing. Believe me. I've done it. Nothing. My mind's made up. It's me. Look, my friends. My friends, I am a respectable man. For Gus, I do a favor, all right. With this picture in the paper - You mean you want us to blow, right, Eddie? Okay. The sooner we get out of here, the better. Our friend Eddie's getting to the place where he'd talk with encouragement. Oh, no. I no talk. Gus cut my belly open. I'm sorry, my friends, to bring you this bad news. - I go now, please. - Sit down, Donato. You're not going anyplace till I say so. Stay put, Eddie. Nobody's gonna hurt you so long as you sit still and keep your mouth shut. The insurance guys must have sicced the cops on that phony, and he spilled. You never should've stopped me when I was gonna blast him. No, Dix, he hasn't spilled, or they wouldn't be looking for just me. Then how come? Because there's only three or four men who can manage a job like this. Somebody in the department with a few brains has decided I'm the guy. I've been half expecting it. It doesn't worry me much. We'll get our money tomorrow, you bet. I hope so. - Where we going, Dix? - I know a place. Eddie, if you're a smart boy, you'll forget you ever seen us. - I wanna see the commissioner. - State your business. I'm a citizen. I can see the commissioner if I want to, can't I? - Is it about Riedenschneider? - Could be. He sure gets around, that guy. About 5,000 people have seen him in the last 24 hours. If you get in that line and wait your turn, you can tell your story. I won't tell anybody but the commissioner. Okay, okay. Sit down and wait, buddy. - But it may be some time. - Okay. I'd like to see the commissioner. Where do you think you're going? - We're on our way home. - Yeah? - Where do you live? - South on Camden. You got no business in here. This is city property. There are signs all over the place. - Everybody uses it. - You're telling me. Even hoodlums have been bringing young girls here. - Is that a fact? - Yeah. It's cost one of our boys his job on account of the beefs. If I were you guys, I'd stay out of here. You understand? Okay, Officer. Hey, wait a minute. You, with the bag, come here. Oh, Dix. Oh, Dix, honey. You'll have to excuse me. I took a couple of sleeping pills, and I guess I'm still kind of groggy. I haven't been able to sleep much lately, Dix, worrying about you and everything. I was up at your place. They told me the cops were after you. Get me some cold water and some towels and stop yapping. Well, sure, Dix. Sure. - Get a move on. - Oh, you bet. Put in hours and hours of planning. Figure everything down to the last detail. Then what? Burglar alarms start going off all over the place for no sensible reason. A gun fires of its own accord, and a man is shot, and a broken-down old harness bull, no good for anything but chasing kids, has to trip over us. Blind accident. What can you do against blind accident? One thing I ought to have figured and didn't was Emmerich. I know why I didn't. I'm not kidding myself. It was the extra dough he promised. I got hungry. Greed made me blind. Hey, Dix. Dix, isn't he the one with the reward on him? Mind your own business. She confirmed what Emmerich said, that he was with her from 11:30 till 3:00. - How did she impress you? - Very much. - She's some babe. - That's not what I mean. Was her manner straightforward? Oh, I guess she was telling the truth, all right. Married 20 years. Consorting with a woman young enough to be his granddaughter. It's disgusting. But nothing about Emmerich would surprise me. Educated man who uses his brains to circumvent the law. Worst type of human being. No excuse for him. - Excuse me, Commissioner. - Well? There's a taxi driver been waiting outside. - Says he's got some important information. - Concerning what? I-I tried to find out, but he wouldn't talk to anyone but you. He's been waiting two hours. - All right, send him in. - Yes, sir. - What's your name? - Charles Wright. Hackie number 14803. Green Stripe Company. What's this information you've got? The little doctor everybody's looking for. - I think I had him for a fare. - You drove him someplace? I'm pretty sure it was him I picked up at the station a week ago Friday. - Friday the 16th? - Yes, sir. - Where'd you take him? - To a number on Camden West. I remember because I asked if he wanted me to wait. I know a fella that got rolled once on Camden West. He didn't have nothin', so they stole his pants and shoes. Where did you take him? What number? 4717. Kind of a storeroom. It was dark. - What's that number again? - 4717. Used to be a bookie joint, Commissioner. Get hold of Lieutenant Ditrich. Yeah, that's him. At first I thought I was making a fool of myself by coming here. But that's him all right, Commissioner. - You may be in for a reward. I hope so. - Lieutenant Ditrich on one. - Where are you, Ditrich? - I'm at 4th Street Station, Commissioner. All right. Now, get a search warrant and go to 4717 Camden West. - Riedenschneider was seen there. - That's 4717? Yeah. Stake your men out before you go in. Get a move on. News just came in. A patrolman was on duty at the car barn. He ran into two men and was slugged. They got away, but he identified the smaller one as Riedenschneider. Good. Great. We'll block off the whole area. And no sirens. We'll make it a sneak. How about the patrolman? Badly hurt? A head wound and he's kinda punchy, but the doctor doesn't think he's got a fracture. Well, son, looks like maybe we're getting somewhere at last. Look, Lieutenant, what-what would I know about Belletier's? I wouldn't mix in no robbery. You know that. - Wouldn't you? - No, of course not! You saw Riedenschneider here, sure. - But that don't say - - You're nuts. Never seen anybody here. How could I? I never been here before this. Well, that being the case, what's to connect me with the Belletier job? Somebody saw him here. I don't know who. Maybe you got a fink around. Look. You're sure you won't have one, Lieutenant? No, thanks, I... never drink while on duty. It's against regulations. Look. I got nothing to hide. Riedenschneider holed up here. He was broke. I let him use a room for a couple days. I got tired of having him around. I gave him a few bucks to get rid of him. - Where'd he go? - I don't know. I don't know! Look, Cobby, do you figure me for a pal, or don't you? I sure do, Lieutenant. Then take my advice and turn state's. We'll make ourselves a little deal with the commissioner. - You won't get more than a year or two. - Look, I-I'm clean. I don't know where the doc went. That's the truth. They won't believe you at headquarters. Every time you'd tell them that, they'd work you over, and you ain't the type that can take it. You'd spill your guts in half an hour. Gi-Give me a break. You came to make a pinch, sure. But I'm not here. I had to go to Chi on business. Uh-uh. You're right here, Cobby. I've always treated you right, Lieutenant. Let me duck out. - You can get away with it. - No, I couldn't. The commissioner's mad. He's out for blood. And it's not going to be mine. You're not gonna stop me. You're gonna let me go! You're gonna do that! If you don't... Yeah, I know. You'll be a Grade-A pigeon. That's right. I'll tell 'em you saw Riedenschneider here and didn't roust him. Why? Because you'd have to explain what you were doing here. I'll tell 'em about the juice you've been getting out of me. The only thing you're doing is making me sore. Once I start singing, I won't stop. - They'll jug you right alongside of me. - That's where you're wrong, Cobby. Even if they believe you, it won't go too hard with me. Because I'll be the guy that cracked the biggest case ever pulled in the country. - Gonna get hurt, Cobby. - Ditrich! What, have you gone crazy? - Stand up! - Aaah! I told you you couldn't take it, Cobby. Here. They'll call me a fink. That's my boy. So, since I'm gonna be busy with a lot of cases, I thought you'd like to take a trip. - Where to? - I don't know. The coast, Florida. Anywhere you like. Could I, Uncle Lon? Anywhere? No fooling? Yes. I think a change of scenery might be good for you. Wait. You wait right here. I've got the most terrific idea. Oh. Cuba. There, that's not a bad idea. Imagine me on this beach here in my green bathing suit. Yipe. I almost bought a white one, but it wasn't quite extreme enough. If I went in for the extreme extreme, I would have bought a French one. Run for your lives, girls. The fleet's in. Oh, Uncle Lon, am I excited. Yipe! Look, Uncle Lon. Isn't it romantic? Real palms and ocean and everything. Who can that be this time of night? See who it is, Uncle Lon. Why are they pounding so? I'm scared, Uncle Lon. Well, young man, you've got an iron fist. Oh, hello, Hardy. Come in. Well, there's a fire in here. Come on in. You look cold. I'm here to arrest you, Emmerich. May I ask what for? Complicity. In robbery and in murder. If I were you, Hardy, I'd think up a few more charges. You might make one of them stand up if you get an imbecile jury and the right judge. - Get the young lady. - Yes, sir. It may interest you to know that your friend Cobb has signed a confession. Want to take a look at it? Here. Okay, miss, it's a shame to bust this door in, but here goes. Haven't you bothered me enough, you big banana head? Just try breaking my door, and Mr. Emmerich will throw you out. 'Fraid not, miss. He's got troubles enough. As a matter of fact, he's a dead duck. Hurry up, Andrews. Bring the young lady in here. Do I have to talk to him? Couldn't I just talk to you? Come on, baby. Get it over with. And... be smart. Tell the commissioner the truth. That's the only thing to do. Come on. Sit down. Andrews, repeat the statement Miss Phinlay made before you yesterday afternoon. She said Mr. Emmerich was in this house with her from 11:30 PM to 3:00 AM last Friday night. Is that the statement you made? - Yes, sir. - Was it the truth? You better think before you answer, unless you wanna go to jail. Jail? That's what happens to one who sets up a false alibi to keep another from being punished for a crime. - Mr. Emmerich wouldn't commit a crime. - He would and did. Tell him the truth. Uncle Lon. It's the only thing to do, unless you want to be indicted for obstructing justice. What I said yesterday was... Well, it wasn't exactly... I mean... - It wasn't really the... - Was it the truth? No, sir. - You weren't with Emmerich, were you? - No, sir. You were someplace else and you were not with him. Yes, sir. He told you what to say, made you learn it by heart. - Answer me. - No. I mean, yes, sir. I mean, I learned it by heart! Get a new statement from her. Have her sign it. Yes, sir. This time, young lady, I want the whole truth. Over here, miss. I'm sorry, Uncle Lon. I tried. You did pretty well, considering. What about my trip, Uncle Lon? Is it still on? Don't worry, baby. You'll have plenty of trips. Seems to be all wrapped up, Emmerich. Oh, here. Say, I'd like to, uh, telephone my wife, if you don't mind. - Getting late. She might be worried. - Help yourself. But don't try to run. You won't get very far. Emmerich! - Wait! Stop! - Come on! - Wait and see! - Break loose! You wait and see, you dirty fink! You're gonna wind up where your pal Emmerich is! You're gonna wind up in the morgue! You wait and see, you dirty fink! - Haul him in! - Fink! Fink! Fink! Fire escape. We're looking for Louis Ciavelli. I'd consider it a great favor if you didn't insist on going in. Mrs. Ciavelli is... Well, I don't have to tell you. If the father says it's okay, Williams, it's okay. - Call the commissioner's office. - Yes, sir. The commissioner knows me. Mention my name. Sortino. Thank you, Father. "Emmerich was a graduate of the law college of State University and had practiced here for over 25 years." What foolishness. Unbelievable. He wouldn't have gotten more than two years. He even double-crossed himself. How's your head, Doc? Good as it ever was, which isn't saying much. Getting out of town won't be a cinch for you with your picture spread around. Oh, I'll get out, all right. I'll take a taxi to the edge of town and have him drive me as far as Cleveland. Sure you wouldn't come along with me, Dix? Keep it. No, thank you. If you won't come, will you finance me? I haven't got but four or five dollars. Sure, I'll finance you. How much you need? I can get along on a thousand dollars, thanks very much. And you can have the rest of these stones. That's $50,000 worth. What would I do with 'em? Can you see me walking into a hock shop with that stuff? First they'd think they were phony, and then they'd yell for the riot squad. No, Doc, you can have the thousand, but no rocks for me. Well, thank you, Dix. Tell me where to write you. At least I can send you the five grand you got coming. - What will your address be in Kentucky? - Forget it. Maybe I'll see you around. Well... - Good-bye then. - Good-bye, Doc. Wait a minute. You haven't got a heater. I'd let you have mine, but... You got a gun, Doll? No. I used to have one around, but I guess somebody stole it. I don't want a gun. I haven't carried a gun since my 20s. You carry a gun, you shoot a policeman. Bad rap, hard to beat. You don't carry a gun, you give up when they hold one on you. All right, Doc. You know best. How about a cup of coffee, honey? That squarehead. He's a funny little guy. I don't get him at all. Maybe it's because he's a foreigner. They just don't think like us. I gotta get out of town too and before morning. Anyway, he's got plenty of guts. - How about a cup of coffee? - Make it or shut up about it. - It's that wound. - Bright girl. Dix, it's starting to bleed again. I know, aspirin. Pickering Avenue and Center Street. - You know where that is? - Other side of town. - How far is that? - I can make it in an hour. Okay. I got relatives living there. I'm between trains and I got nothing else to do. I know how it is. I got relatives myself, on both sides. Always writing me letters for money. I haven't spoken German for a long, long time. - You have a M?nchen accent. - Nat?rlich. I was born there. You know what they say. "Home is where the money is." Ja. Franz, how would you like to drive me to Cleveland? It's a long way, my friend. But it would be quicker than to take the train tomorrow morning. - What about your relatives? - Ah, forget them. Well, I don't know. Cleveland. That's a long way. - Costs a lot of money. - There's a $50 tip for you. - What do you say? - For $50, I'd drive you to the North Pole. We better get gas if we're going to Cleveland. Let's not stop till we get out of town. Then we can do everything at once. Have a little meal, beer, a cigar and go in comfort. I can see you're a man who likes his pleasures. Well, Franz, what else is there in life, I ask you? Bitte. You've been gone nearly two hours. What happened? It took time. I was stopped twice. Prowl cars. The neighborhood's crawling with coppers. You can't imagine - - All right. Did you get a car? - Yes. Here's the change. It only came to $400. I got it from Big Vivian. It's in good shape, except the brakes need relining - - Did you put gas in it? - Yes. - Where'd you park it? - Three blocks away. - Good girl. - Dix. - Yeah? - I'm-I'm scared. - All those cops out there. - They don't worry me one little bit. I'll drive slow. Head right down the main boulevard, and in 10 hours, I'll be home. - Honey, how you gonna drive all that way? - I'll make it. No. Not in the shape you're in. Not in a million years. - I'll make it. - Dix. Let me go with you? - Please, Dix. Please. - Are you crazy? I'm on the lam. I'm wanted bad, packing heat. - What good would you be? - I could drive. No. I'm wanted on a killing rap. You know what that means. I don't care. I want to be with you. You can't go without me. I won't let you. I won't tell you where the car is. I don't get it. I just don't get it. All right. Get your things packed. Come on. Let's play some more. I'm fresh out of nickels, Jeannie. How about you, Red? - I'm always fresh out. - Well, get some. You can cost a guy a lot of dough. Nickels he's complaining about. What a spender. Sure, he wants a date. He always wants a date. And where do we go? To a third-run movie. Then we take a ride and blow two tires. Then we come here, and what do you treat me to? Cokes. I can't even listen to records. - For you. - Thanks. Would you have change for this in nickels, please? Sure thing. At least dig down for enough to play me some music. Aw, Jeannie, cut it out. Excuse me, boys. Young lady, I like music too. - Would you play me a tune? - Sure. What do you want me to play? - You pick 'em. - Gosh, how many have you got here? - Not very many. Play what you like. - Okay. Mister. Mister, it's getting late. Mister, we better be moving along. Plenty of time, my friend. Plenty of time. Look, mister, it's a long way to Cleveland. Well, I suppose we better go now. Don't go. We haven't used all the nickels. - You use 'em. - Thanks. - It's sure nice of you. - Don't mention it. Good-bye, and thanks. Thanks ever so much. Pleasure was all mine. You men want something? What do you think, Ed? Might be the number one boy. - Just might be. - What is this? - Shut up. - Better frisk him. - Go right ahead. - Put up your hands. You must have me mixed up with somebody else. I'm from Cleveland. The importing business. My name's Klemper. Nothing there. Let me see that coat, hackie. - You're making a big - - Keep out of this. Tell you what, Bill. Better phone the city and check on the description. We don't need a description. I'll tell 'em we got him. - Okay, mister. Keep those hands up. - Of course. Excuse me, Officer, but will you tell me something? Maybe. Just keep your face front. How long have you been out here? - That's a darn funny question. - It's not important. We've been watching you through that window two, three minutes. Ah, yes. Say about as long as it takes to play a phonograph record. How's that again? What are you talking about? - It doesn't matter. - Keep your face front. Do you mind if I smoke a cigar? Just stand quiet there, mister. We'll talk about smoking a cigar later. Certainly, Officer. Certainly. How you feeling now, Dix? All right. Cold. Didn't used to get cold this time of year. Why don't you let me drive for a while, honey. You don't know the way. I'd only have to keep telling you. Much longer, Di - Dix? Dix? Dix. Dix. No, Dix. Dix. Mister. Mister. Mister! Mister, you gotta help me. I gotta find a doctor. - My husband, he's sick. - Come on. I'll show you. Go straight on, ma'am. Down to the end of the block. We'll get Doc Swanson. He lives right near here on Elm Street. My husband, he's sick, fainted. Get him inside where I can look at him. Right in this other room here, please. Up on the table. Take his coat off. Put it on the chair. Yeah. Hmm? This man's been hemorrhaging. He's lost a lot of blood. What happened? He was hurt. He was hurt in an auto accident. - How long has this wound been let go? - A couple of days. Is it bad, Doctor? Is he hurt real bad? Well, it's not good. - You got a strong arm, Mr. Atkinson? - Good as any, Doc, I guess. Come around here and hold this for me, please. That's right. There we are. Hello, uh, let me talk to Tom. This is Dr. Swanson. Wake him up. - I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water. - Sure, Dix. Sure. Lie down, sweetheart. Please lie down. Hello, Sheriff? Listen, Tom. I got a man here with a gunshot wound. Pretty bad. - Here, sweetheart. - Who's that? I had to take you to the doctor's, Dix. I couldn't help it. Hold him? I don't have to. The man's unconscious. No, no, no. He's a stranger to me. His wife's with him. She says it was an auto accident. Dix. Dix. Dix! Dix. Dix. Dix. Well, he won't get very far, that's for sure. He hasn't got enough blood left in him to keep a chicken alive. - More questions? - I don't like to harp on the same point, but what about Ditrich? - If the past of this police department - - Ditrich's in jail. He'll go to trial. He'll be tried by 12 citizens for whom he's been working. Let them show justice or compassion as they see fit. What would be your verdict, Commissioner? I'm not sure. I'm not sure at all. Let me put it this way. It's not anything strange that there are corrupt officers in police departments. The dirt they're trying to clean up is bound to rub off on some, but not all. Maybe one out of 100. The other 99 are honest men trying to do an honest job. - Robbery at 193 Scully Avenue. - Listen. All units, robbery at 193 - ...two male Caucasians armed with blue steel - I know you're police reporters and hear this all day, but listen with your conscience, not just your ears. - ...wearing a brown felt hat - - ...a shooting at 25 James Boulevard. Woman screaming. Car 1-2, shooting at 2-5 James Boulevard. Woman - All units, strong-arm slugging, 3216 River Drive - We send police assistance to every one of those calls, because they're not just codes on a radio beam, they're cries for help. People are being cheated, robbed, murdered, raped. And that goes on 24 hours a day, every day in the year. And that's not exceptional, that's usual. It's the same in every city of the modern world. But suppose we had no police force, good or bad. Suppose we had... just silence. Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer. The battle's finished. The jungle wins. The predatory beasts take over. Think about it. Well, gentlemen, three men are in jail, three men dead, one by his own hand. One man's a fugitive, and we have reason to believe seriously wounded. That's six out of seven. Not bad. We'll get the last one too. In some ways, he's the most dangerous of them all. A hardened killer. A hooligan. A man without human feeling or human mercy. I tell ya... the black one's the best we ever had at Hickorywood. The bay's all right, but... the black's a real good colt. Prettiest we have - goin' - anything... Pa ever bred. Easiest thing, yeah, but... he's always... way out front of... the other yearlings. He's a stake horse or... I never saw one. I sure hope... Pa don't sell him. If Pa just hangs on to that black colt, everything's gonna be all right. Oh, dear God. I said it. I'll say it again. If Pa just hangs on to that black colt, everything's... gonna be okay. What's this - Oh, Dix! Dix. Dix. Dix? Oh, God. Oh, my God. Dix. Dix?
