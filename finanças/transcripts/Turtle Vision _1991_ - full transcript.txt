High School Girl Next Door: Melons and Peeping aka Hidden Video Report: Dark Shot! aka Turtle Vision Welcome back. Well, did you get some good ones? I'm not so sure. Don't expect too much. Well, in spite of what you say, I always really like what you get. Somehow, your videos make me feel like I'm really doing the peeping myself. I feel something from your films. I don't really know what it is, but you are the best cameraman. Keep up the good work. There's an address written on the back of the picture. I want you to head over there tonight. There's a good amount of customers who want to see peeping films of those kind of girls. Well, you can get some interesting ones. Don't you think so? If yakuza or the like are involved, I could get in some deep shit. Don't be worried. That's unlike you. Anyways, you're a pro among pros. You'll never do anything to give away your presence. Even if you do get into trouble, I'll smooth things over for you. Okay, I gotta go do it tonight. That's good. Oh, hey! This is the newest type. It'll work good, even in dark places. Hello, I want to call a girl. Well, let me see... I'd rather have an ordinary girl. Yeah, send me the most ordinary-looking girl please. My address is Shinjuku Ward, West Shinjuku 3-15. Oh, hello. I'd like to order a full course dinner for two. Alright, better eat before it gets cold. I'm starving. What's the matter? C'mon, eat! Do you always make girls eat with you like this? I'm not very hungry right now. It's okay, just eat! It's you! What's the matter with you? You're spacing out. Did something happen? If there's something bothering you, don't hesitate to tell me. You're the best I've got, and my business depends on you. It's nothing. I'm just a little tired. I see. Well, don't overdo it. If you collapse on me, I'll go out of business. I don't mind, so long as you get appropriate rest. Anyways, our health is important to our work, too. This way. Is it alright? Was it difficult? Was it painful? You poor thing. You poor thing. Alright, I did it! I bought lots of mushrooms, because they were on sale today. You said you like them, right? To be honest, I don't really like mushrooms very much. But it's okay. I want to start liking the things that you like. Not only that, I've heard about it in a song too. It said likes and dislikes are the shame of the masses. Oh, yeah. There is something the old woman at the greengrocer told me. Lately, a female degenerate has been appearing frequently in this area. Somehow, it seems that she only goes after men. She cuts their eyes with a blade. She said that she doesn't target women, but I don't feel very good about this. Who are you? What is this place? What am I doing here? Who are you? Are you saying you don't know why you're here? It seems you have a tendency to go sleepwalking. What? I'm the one who was taken by surprise. There was a girl wearing a sailor suit, lying in the street in the middle of the night. I thought something was up. Maybe you don't want my help, but I think for now you should go to the hospital and see a doctor. Walking at night like that is too dangerous. But it's never happened even once until now. You can't help but not be aware of it yourself, but wouldn't your family have noticed? But my big sister hasn't said a word about it. What about the rest of your family? I just live alone with my big sister. What's the matter? Do you know how to get to the hospital over that way? If it's okay, I'd like you to take me. It's not like I'm clueless, but... Thank you. Thanks. Is this your first time with video therapy? Yes. What sort of thing are we doing? It's nothing difficult. All you have to do is be quiet and watch the video. A video? It's something like an "image video", but it directly influences the human subconsciousness. It opens what we could refer to as the hidden door deep within the heart. After the psychological trauma is exposed, the rest is up to you. So what are you saying? In other words, erase and forget it. So I'm gonna have my memories erased? In a sense, psychological trauma is like noise left on a videotape. It's best to eliminate it. And it's not necessarily the case that the noise got there because of yourself. What do you mean? If you leave a videotape by the loudest television or speaker for a long time... ...noise gets onto it sometimes, right? The same kind of thing happens between people. In other words, the severe psychological trauma of someone dear to you spreads... ...when you're in close contact with them for a long period of time. In this case, the affected person isn't conscious of it at all, so it's even harder to deal with. Well, that's enough for the explanation. Let's hurry up and get started. You've started seeing something, huh? The roof of a school. What else? A few men... They're wearing school uniforms. What are they doing? They're laughing. And then... They're getting on top of my body. Nooo! A camera... A video camera. They're filming me... they're filming me. It's been quite some time, Eiji. I spent forever looking for you. No! What is this?! Stop! Eiji! No! No! Nooo!! It's okay now. It's over. It's all over already. Maki! Eiji! Let me get a better look at your face. Eiji! Maki!
