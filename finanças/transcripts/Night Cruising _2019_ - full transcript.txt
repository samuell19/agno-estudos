This is Cazablanke. A frontier planet owned by the United Galaxy Space Force. Population: about a million. More than 90% of the residents are Earthian-hybrids: mainly soldiers and their families. Everyone else must struggle to keep the soldiers' world alive. What a weakling! And your clothes... You look like shit. I wear what feels good. Since I'm not a soldier like you, I don't need to judge by appearances. I'd die before becoming UGSF beefcake. You can tell I'm a soldier? It's your stink. You officers all smell like the same detergent. You dog! Stop the talk! What're we waitin' for? When the coin hits, we begin. He's not bad! But can he take this? What'd he just hit me with? Some kinda sound strike? What? It doesn't work on him? Let's see if he likes this. - Wait! - Wait! What's your problem? What's your problem? Wait... Your eyes... They don't see. Who gives a shit? So that's why... I lobbed a visual hallucination at you using my Telepathy. Now it makes sense. I felt something like a headache. You wanna use your Sense for real? For real? For the United Galaxy Space Force. Spare me the military crap. Just hear me out... Major Connor here. Sorry for interrupting, Sir. No problem. But this will be audio only. This is Captain Tatiyana Aguiari, Delta Regiment. This is urgent information. What is it? Spit it out. It's the Ghost, Sir. It broke into our server in Blue Cityside. Our secret data is at risk of being leaked. The Ghost did? The Ghost has penetrated and destroyed all our security barriers. What are you waiting for? Send in a platoon. Have them prevent any leak. My men are refusing. They're afraid of the Ghost. If they can't see the enemy, they're sitting ducks. A bunch of cowards... Do you have a plan, then? No, Sir. I'm afraid not. The men are no use. There's no intel. If the UGSF can't get in there, find someone who can. I'll take responsibility. Get out there and find someone. Aye, Sir. I thought you might be able to feel the Ghost. Here. Drink this. Yeah, thank you. It's a good offer, right? The Ghost would be a fun target for you. Okay... It sounds pretty interesting. I'm in. On one condition... You come too. I use my Sense to capture it. Then you read it with your Telepathy. Don't you need Auto-Drive? Why bother when I've got you here? Have it your way. I'm Telepathing you the route. Please do. I hate relying on the 'puters for everything. Lesk Otokham, First Lieutenant. This is Captain Tatiyana. I'm on my way to the site. He's with me. Edih, how do you do? I'm Captain Tatiyana. Thanks for helping. My pleasure. Good to meet ya. You have a hot voice. That sultry voice... leads you right into the arms of a handsome boy. Lesk, I know you Telepathed something to Edih just now. Fess up to it. No, Ma'am. I just conveyed the truth. Earthian-hybrids need more than words to understand anything more complex than two genders. Are you fibbing? Fine, then... Don't trust First Lieutenant Otokham too much, Edih. He's prone to misusing his ability. Got it. I'll keep my guard up. By the way, Lesk, how much did you tell him about the Ghost? Everything I could possibly know. Really? Telepathy sure is convenient. We're just arriving at Blue Cityside. Copy that. Please be careful, guys. If you feel danger, you can abandon the mission. Edih, keep an eye on Lesk. Aye, Sir. You sound like a soldier... It's fun to pretend. What do you Sense? Nothin'. Nothing here, too. Clear. It's in here. Where? Read my image as I close in. Okay. Someone's here. The sensations are fusing... You woke up? I dunno what happened. I was following you via camera, but the image cut out. I need a report from you now. I'm not feeling my buddy here, or the Ghost. Something's there. Do you have a favorite movie? I like Touch. It was the first movie I saw in a movie theater. Maybe that's why I remember it. My blindness is acquired. I was sighted until my mid-twenties. I loved movies, so I watched a lot. I gave up watching them as I couldn't see anything. But now, some movies have audio descriptions for the visually impaired. So I started watching again. I watched a lot of movies as a kid but not much anymore. One film I remember from back then is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which I really loved. When I'm feeling down, I watch one called Snakes and Earrings. It brightens me up, I guess. There are many movies I love, but one I always come back to. That's Rainbow Kids by Kihachi Okamoto. I've watched it so many times. I've forgotten what visual perception is. So I don't have any memories of seeing. The Karate Kid comes to mind. And, let's see... It's old, but Wheels on Meals. And, Top Gun too. Their heroes are all real men. That's why I like them. I watch... action movies. Like Wheels on Meals or The Karate Kid. It's not like I know exactly how they move. They're from way back when my mother would watch with me. She didn't give me all the details. But she would explain the story, like who was winning. That's how I enjoyed movies. Hideyuki Kato System Engineer/Musician Hideyuki Kato System Engineer/Musician The next stop is Ogikubo. Doors on the right will open. - Oops, I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Excuse me. This is it. The wall tells me that. - So this wall is a sign? - Yeah. Please touch the screen to confirm you're of legal drinking age. - Touch the center, please. - The center? More in the center, please. Here? Sorry. Let me help. Yes, this is it. - Ah, okay. - Thank you. Hey, I'm here. I'm right here. Jeez. It's scary here. Yeah, the drivers are reckless. I'm here. Fabrication/Repair/Tuning for Guitar and Bass Here you go. - This is the neck? - Yup. Thanks. Here's your receipt. Kato was born blind. And now he's making a movie. Well, I dunno. I mean, why not? I communicate very normally with him. He's my bud. - Is he? - Yeah. I don't think about his blindness. Except when he stands up to go. - Right? - Yeah. I even asked if he'd seen Shin Godzilla. This is the screenplay. I want to show that they meet as rivals and recognize each other's ability. There's respect. And then they decide to team up. - The two characters? - Yeah. The protagonist doesn't see... Well, not with his eyes. That's why he can sense the existence of the Ghost, instead. What is the Ghost, then? It's immaterial. The protagonist's buddy is so-called "able-bodied"? That's right. Then what does he offer? He's a telepathist. What's that mean? Within a three-meter range, telepathists can mind-read or mind-speak with anyone. Their abilities are augmented if they can touch their target. Was that the definition? Yes, it was. It sure went over me. I don't have that ability, you could say. I've read your screenplay. It's fine as an SF story. Hirotoshi Kobayashi Writer Hirotoshi Kobayashi Writer Hirotoshi Kobayashi Writer The planet, in your treatment, The planet, in your treatment, it's an Earth-like one developed for the Space Force. it's an Earth-like one developed for the Space Force. Kato uses a braille notetaker to record Kobayashi's comments. Kato uses a braille notetaker to record Kobayashi's comments. Kato uses a braille notetaker to record Kobayashi's comments. Yes. We need to decide whether to convey that through on-screen text or narration. There's no scene that demands computer graphics. Punch holes in black paper and backlight it, and you'll get what looks like stars. Sometimes that's all you need to suggest the universe. Put some tennis balls in front of the camera, and you have planets. Just hang them from the ceiling with thread and film them, and you've realized your world. What I'm really wondering about is whether I can show him moving in a slightly superhuman way. Maybe he can stay in the air longer than a regular human. Can I do that in a live-action movie? - You want that action? - Yes. But not cheap-looking. Well, I'm not sure what a cheap one would look like. Oh, yes, of course. I haven't figured out how to represent the Ghost in the very last scene. Okay. I know it's too vague to say it should be something mysterious. I created him, but I'm stuck. Does the Ghost have a shape? Not in my imagination. - It doesn't? - Right. Showing an absence is very hard. I get that! To people with visual perception, I can say shoot like this to get the look you want. But the challenge in this film lies in helping a person without sight find the images to tell a story. To actually do this... Makoto Sasaki Night Cruising Director Kato's friend Sasaki documents the process as he assists in Kato's production. Just Cause Productions, Inc. Just Cause Productions, Inc. Hello. Just Cause Productions, Inc. I am planning to direct a film as a non-sighted person. And I'd very much like to get your support. And I'd very much like to get your support. Miyuki Tanaka Night Cruising Producer One goal for me is to show how far a non-sighted person can go in making a movie. When we watch movies made by sighted directors, non-sighted people encounter things that aren't exactly walls or barriers, but that still need some kind of explanation. So that's one hurdle to overcome. But, when sighted people see a non-sighted person's film... When people who understand a movie through its visual images see one made by a non-sighted person... I wanna know how they'll react. Please don't take offense, but part of me feels like I'm picking a fight. I just have to try this. If people with eyesight tried this, they'd just show night. But to me, there's no dark and no light. That's the point. You feel dark because you know light, and vice versa. This must be Tokyo Skytree. I can understand shapes if things are made in sizes I can handle. Without this model, I'd never know that it's triangular with a round bit. I never knew what R2-D2 was shaped like. But I could after I got this when I visited Anaheim. As you know from my screenplay, I made the protagonist blind. He's my stand-in, in a way. I can say that I'm using his point of view to show how I usually capture a space. But, many people have given me advice. So I know I need to consider framing. And when the scene changes, I need an establishing shot before jumping inside the building. I realize I need to follow the usual grammar of cinema. Ken Ohara Director, Just Cause Productions Ken Ohara Director, Just Cause Productions Given what you've just said, Ken Ohara Director, Just Cause Productions Ken Ohara Director, Just Cause Productions I think we can use sound to create a common worldview. I think we can use sound to create a common worldview. When we're working on a film, especially on action scenes, we often rely on sound to communicate. If I ask my client what rhythm they want, they might reply by saying it should be like Japanese drumming. So instead of this... This... That's how we work. Sound can be a fine tool. Clients use onomatopoeia a lot. "It flies like this..." "clashes like that..." "The car passes like so..." "And explodes like this..." That's how they talk. And I just borrow their rhythm. I get visuals ready for them by the next time we meet. Oh, okay. So if you give us sounds, we'll make great visuals. I speak into this mike, right? Yep. Okay. That was too loud. Fuckin' loud... How fast should I read? Just read it. Whatever you say. Can I have a cue? Now. "This is Cazablanke." "A frontier planet owned by the United Galaxy Space Force." You'll add sound effects later, right? I need to add in the sound effects, like the sound of the wind. I see, I see. "I'd die before becoming UGSF beefcake." He's trying to be cool. Ah, okay. You're speaking too fast. A little slower... If I speak slower, I'll forget. Fine, I'll try. - Let's do it. - Alright. "I'd die before becoming..." I messed up. "If the UGSF can't..." Shit! "If the UGSF can't get in there, find someone who can." What a mess! You see? Hold on. - What's that? - It starts in the middle. I don't get it. Nothing here, but it starts from here. What's that mean? No letters here, only blanks. It starts here... It just says "and." Then goes to the next section. So I can't read. I have to fix this. So I can read. Good, it's done. - "Wait!" - "Wait!" That sounds great. - Does it? - Sure. Okay, that's all for now. That's it. You've got what you need. I have all the elements. So you'll add sound effects, then share your ideas that way? We can call it a "sound storyboard." You didn't want to do it. I wanted to rely on sound only as my last resort. To resist the stereotype? People always connect you to sound. That's right. People presume that's where I should start. People don't get why you want to do this. They're asking what the point is. It's something that I want to try... That won't convince them. They think a blind person should do something else, just not a movie. Like what? Like a radio drama... That just shows how much they don't understand. I'm tired of making radio dramas. People probably doubt I can even edit. "How can you make a movie if you can't see the image?" People ask cruel questions. That's the challenge. By any means possible, right? We try anything to get over the barriers. That's what we say, right? They always ask for the vision inside my head. Especially people in film and video talk like that. That's where they bring the conversation. My goal in the first place was just to make a movie. After talking with a lot of people, I've realized that's not good enough. So, as someone born without sight, maybe I can share my vision. I'm not sure "vision" is the right word. I can turn the images I have in my head into a movie. That might work. National Museum of Nature and Science I'm congenitally blind. Kazuhiro Sakaue Physical Anthropologist Kazuhiro Sakaue Physical Anthropologist To me, a face is a face. There's just one kind. To me, a face is a face. There's just one kind. Some faces must be aesthetically good. People can call someone handsome or someone pretty. If I were to explore faces carefully, I could discover the difference. But since I'm writing a screenplay for this movie, I need to specify what kind of face each of my characters has. I just wrote that my characters are "so-called beautiful." To help me concretely imagine the faces I need for my film, I'm hoping you'll share some of your knowledge. That's the front part. That's the top of the eye socket. Trace your fingers down. This is the root of the nose. Followed by the nose itself. And then the teeth. - You see? - Yes. Further down is the lower jawbone. The part from the glabella to the nose makes a very clear and unique impression on others. The glabella to the nose? It's the central structure of a face. With a quick glance here, you can almost recognize a person. It's nearly enough to identify them. This one here is slimmer in width. Yes, quite narrow. It's a woman from the samurai class. Here's a merchant-class woman. Now, the reconstructed faces... This is the reconstructed face of a merchant. And the reconstructed face of a samurai woman. The jaws are totally... Yes, you noticed. - Different. - Yes. What's interesting about beauty is that we, scientists, can understand differences in shape. But we make no value judgments about beauty itself. Yet, when you see woodblock prints or pictures of Edo era beauties, nearly all of them are like this. it's a question of preference. That's true. When you read, you can project your own preference onto a character. But, movies are different. How the audience connects with a face affects how they identify with the story. Human faces have simple structures. Functionally, there's almost no difference. But for culture and sexual reproduction, that difference is huge. It's a contradiction, in a way. As a member of the Anti-Lookism Club, I'd like you to expose the unfairness of it all. Yes! Thank you! A-Lab Co., Ltd. Sensitivity Engineering Laboratory Tadashi Shimaya Android Engineer Tadashi Shimaya Android Engineer The settings are wrong. Her face goes up when I say "down." And vice versa. She opened it. Now, her tongue. When she shakes her head like this, she looks like she's smiling. People project onto her what's missing. I see... Watch her hair... - It moves with her face. - With a slight delay. That makes her look even more real. I smile or make some other face unconsciously. It's hard to make myself do that. And it's hard to show that to others. When I smile, I'm like this. Smiles might not be this weird. Kato, imitate her. Like this? You look great. I must look weird. Oh, okay... It's hard. That's good. Japan Women's University Hello. Come on in. - Thank you. - Hello. Welcome. Ken Sagawa Color Research Scientist Ken Sagawa Color Research Scientist I was surprised to hear you're going to make a movie. Ken Sagawa Color Research Scientist Ken Sagawa Color Research Scientist It's a challenge, but yes. It's a challenge, but yes. I need to be specific about the colors we'll be using. What my characters wear, the kind of sky, or even some chair nearby. I have to give exact instructions. If I can find a good way to express color, I know it will come in handy. Then I could suggest the colors for my film and how to use them. Color is an electromagnetic wave, you know? I've heard that. In short, color is an electric wave. The human eye can grasp only certain parts of that wave, only a narrow bandwidth. That's how it works. Differences in spectral components create colors. There are three central differences. Difference in hue, in brightness, and in saturation. We can express colors in three dimensions. Right in front of you... Please touch carefully. Can you feel the many panels? Yes. There are ten of them. Each panel represents a type of color. It's light here... - And dark there. - The bottom is dark. As you move away from the center... - The color gets deeper. - Deeper, I see. This is red. And next, orange. This is yellow. This is yellow-green. Green. And red. It goes back like this. Yes. As you feel, it's a ring. The most important part... This is called a hue circle. When we put colors in order, they become a ring. So this is what we call the color solid. I bet you haven't gone bowling. - Yes, I have. - You have? A bowling ball is always dark. It's down with the other dark colors. Okay. Darker colors represent heaviness. The dark color suggests a strength and heaviness that will send the pins flying. Since the pins fly... they are light and hence white. You can memorize the order of these ten colors. On these tags, I punched holes that you can feel. By making one hole big, or by punching holes, I'm communicating color to you. That's why there are holes. Yes, I feel it. That's like braille. So this is orange, because there is a hole here. By identifying the location of the hole, you'll now know it's orange. Okay, so this is... the next color, gray. It's between black and white. I get the meaning. If this were on some clothing, you'd know its color. Add in colors' emotional associations, and you can plan a color scheme. Before, color was just a concept for me. Oh, really? - But now it all fits. - Yes, like this. The fact it's all in a circle like this. - Yes, like this. - Okay. Did this help you understand? Yes, very much. If this was all, it would take some time as it's too 3D. But the tags helped. They really did. You know color now? Now, I can use color to express myself. That's wonderful. Please do. We don't know, however, how color carries value. That's a question of the mind. Perceptions are immaterial. So there's no way to be certain Tanaka-san and I see the same color. I still haven't written the transitions. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. He loves to take on an opponent. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd.

Scene 5A: In the Car Scene 5A: In the Car Scene 5A: In the Car This is developed in the driving scene. The point is not about lacking something. His strength comes from the fact he is not sighted. The story is clear about this. But if you don't know what the Ghost is, you might miss the point. Yuuki Matsuzawa Lead Concept Artist Yuuki Matsuzawa Lead Concept Artist This is a worldview.

CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD. The designs are printed using a Casio 2.5D printer so that Kato can check them. I'm taking them out now. Please wait a sec. They are mounted on boards. - This is when they're at the seawall? - That's right. - This is his extended arm? - Yes. What's this? A bag containing water bottles. - It's just there? - Yes. Edih is here, and this is Lesk. Lesk is extending his arm to give Edih some water. Okay. You once described asking for water. When someone gives you water, your only choice is to trust them. Since you don't know if it's really water or not. We thought a scene like that would work well with your story. Yeah, okay. Here, you get a sense that something is approaching. Maybe the smoke of light reflected off buildings. Maybe the smoke of light reflected off buildings.

I appreciate how deeply everyone has thought about it. Tell me why you want to appear in this movie. Tell me why you want to appear in this movie. Audition Script: Tatiyana I'm really intrigued by the project. A film made by someone blind... I wanna see what happens. Okay. I'm visually impaired. I'm blind and don't see at all. What do you think about the fact that I'm directing a movie? For me, a person is a person, a human is a human. So I don't see any problem. I wonder what kind of movie it could be. I guess I'm just interested in the idea. - I dunno... - No opinion? - Should I have one? - It's fine. Then, I don't. I want you to communicate something to me. Act it out. But I want you to do so by touching me. Is that okay? Thanks for that. Don't look at the cup with your eyes but pick it up and drink from it. Please make those motions. Thank you. - May I touch your head? - Of course. What do you think? - I'm struggling. - You are. His hairstyle matches my image of Tatiyana. Really? Basically, this is a science fiction film. Yes. You might think Cazablanke is a very different world from Earth. But that's not my goal. The characters look like Earthlings. The characters look like Earthlings. Eri Takayama Stylist Rie Tomomori Hair/Makeup Rie Tomomori Hair/Makeup Let's talk about hairstyles, starting with Edih. Let's talk about hairstyles, starting with Edih. He's got long hair. I'm going to be adamant about the color. Silver hair, silver-colored. He should look like me, down to my bangs. Yeah, okay. Just like me, including the bangs. Do you want the color to look artificial? His hair hasn't turned gray with age. But it's not like he dyed his hair, either. That's just how his race looks. What does silver mean to you, Kato? Here we go, again. Silver isn't the color people imagine when they think of SF. So there's something... That's the point. I'm not making a typical SF story. Black is out. And I wanted to avoid typical colors like blonde or brown. If you need a reason, it's because he needs to have a different air. Edih is wearing a sweatsuit. You want it to be red, right? Is it red? It's more like... Was that because red looks good on you, Kato-san? - I'm not set on it. - Really? I'll keep red as one option. We can have options. - I'm not insistent on it. - Good. Going to the sweatsuit and his costume... Edih can't be bothered. In this story, he's not sure if it looks good on himself or not. So it might be good for him to look a bit odd. Okay. Toshimitsu Kokido Actor (Edih) Toshimitsu Kokido Actor (Edih) I'm now a lot stronger. Toshimitsu Kokido Actor (Edih) Toshimitsu Kokido Actor (Edih) Are the sandals too macho? Are the sandals too macho? Yes, the sandals... The sweatsuit's cool. - May I touch your face? - Sure. Should he fight in sandals? More like deck shoes would work. That's my sense. I have deck shoes. That kind of feel. I agree the sandals are good, but shoes fit better. - He looks sharp. - He sure does. Actually, it works. Tanaka-san will show you. On this touch-palette, colors are arranged in a circle so Kato can feel them. On this touch-palette, colors are arranged in a circle so Kato can feel them. So both his hair and his clothes are in this color area. On this touch-palette, colors are arranged in a circle so Kato can feel them. When the color of his hair is closer to white, his sweatsuit is around here and has a bit red in it. Some bling will make it look good. Akira Toyoda Actor (Tatiyana) Akira Toyoda Actor (Tatiyana) You prefer... I prefer the previous design. - Roughly, it's in this area. - Between blue and green. The previous one was over here. This, okay. Between yellow-green and green. So more like... Closer to yellow? Takayama-san, the jacket, please. You'll try it on? - See? - Right, it's small. I prefer the shape of this cut. Alno LeGale Actor (Lesk) Great. So cool. Okay, that's it. It's what you imagined? Yes, it is. When I came from Shibuya Station today, I walked halfway with my eyes shut. To get a feel. You mustn't. I made a point of being careful. So I was fine. A step on the right. A gentle slope from here. They're adults. What?! Three people have four heads. And there are two more stuffed animals. Here's the leg. I get it. Okay. He stands facing this side? Please stand inside the circle. - Okay. - Great. Three, two, one. Pose. Three, two, one. Pose. Thank you. Wow! Who's this guy? Who the hell is he? My torso is quite thick, I see. This hairstyle... This is Edih. With his ears hidden, and his hair like this. Yeah, this is it... It's good. Production can now begin. Four teams are ready to help Kato visualize his "inner vision" in six scenes. Each team uses a different technique. Scene 1: Frontier Planet Cazablanke Space Modeling I mainly sculpt, but I also work in video, drawing, and photography. This is my sculpture. It's a person. - It's a person with... - But also... - What? - I've attached things. Is it plaster? It's called gesso, but yeah, it's like plaster. It's called gesso, but yeah, it's like plaster. Teppei Kaneuji Sculptor Teppei Kaneuji Sculptor These sculptures remind me of Kinkeshi erasers. Did you have them as a kid? - They influenced me a lot. - I guessed. We're about the same age. Kato, what about you? I loved collecting them. - You loved touching them? - Yeah. Who was your favorite in Kinnikuman? I liked the feel of the square characters like Watchman. Watchman is a geeky character. - I liked Sunshine, too. - Sunshine is square. Who was yours? Let's see. The Ninja or Wolfman. You liked cool ones. They were great. I'd like to ask for your help with Scene 1. I'm wondering how to begin the scene. I'd like to show this planet as one among many others. How about using balls and spheres? You could put them all in motion and then film. Or bounce them. These are excellent ideas. But I first want to know what it will look like. Of course. Let's hang the stuff from the ceiling. If we do that first, I can check them. Yes, you can decide the layout. I imagined the sky would be a dome. Like a transparent dome. This may look weird, but I imagined something like this. Say this is a cloud. It would rest on the sky like this. So it won't fall. Yes, you think it could rest there. Think of this as a fixed star. Think of this as a fixed star. This mat with special paper is called a Raised Writer. This mat with special paper is called a Raised Writer. By pressing firmly, whatever you write appears in relief. By pressing firmly, whatever you write appears in relief. Slowly, these ones began to drift away. Slowly, these ones began to drift away. There's no regularity. If this is the fixed star, the planets move around like this. If I shoot like this, and here is the fixed star, then a long shot would get them all? So the star is not a tiny point. You want something big and round and visible on the screen. You want something big and round and visible on the screen. Tetsuya Shiota Cinematographer Tetsuya Shiota Cinematographer Tetsuya Shiota Cinematographer That's what I was thinking. Tetsuya Shiota Cinematographer The audience needs to understand the relations first. I'm fine with whatever else. Alright. One shot just like this, though! I got it. - Who is this? - It's a doodle. But whose face? Whose? A face is just a face. It's nobody's. - It's not anyone's. - Right. It's yours, then. Then give him some glasses. Sujin Elementary School, Kyoto How big across is the room? About five to six meters. Instead of filming in pitch black, it's better to show that our universe is a darkened classroom. What color is this? It's hard to explain. This ball would hurt. Huh? A basketball? You're thinking of hitting me? I'm seeing what they feel like, now. I'll ask about the colors later. You're choosing by touch. By touch and shape. On what basis? - Basis? - Yeah. No basis. - Just some feeling? - Yeah. On what basis did you choose your favorite color? Choose my favorite color? You're putting me in your shoes. In my shoes. How do you choose a planet? I haven't gotten there yet. You haven't? I need to know their colors and patterns to do that. I have a globe light here inside a plastic bag. I can paint it red, wrap it in a color gel, or something. We can hang it from up here, or put it on a stand like that one. It's not subtle, though. I see. Instead of one line, let's make them random. Let's move them as we hang them. So you want them off center, not so orderly. - Look... - This is totally cool. - Like this? - Amazing. I'll attach it. It's a star? No, a spaceship. The one that flies. This is pretty good. - Which was this? - Red. The other is green. So I use the tape to connect the bulbs to the batteries. That's it. That sounds interesting. So like this, inside here... - Use red and yellow. - Sure. Made just as the Director ordered. I like this. When this part sticks out, they say the face is good-looking. With eyebrows. It's a chiseled face. I'm trying. Is it good? It looks like me! Like you! Uh-oh. So this is the target. And beyond that, you have the face. Yes, okay. There's a red star to your left. - The red one in plastic. - Now, I get it. It's not too obvious. It looks fine. - The UFO is here. - Okay. - The sun is here. - Okay. Please touch the camera. How can I explain this? If you move the camera... - It stays here. - Yes, it does. - It's amazing. - It's motor-controlled. Lights, camera, action. Lights, camera, action. It's a good shot. For the second shot, can we add the UFO around here? It gradually becomes visible. Cazablanke! Could you snap your finger under it? - Okay, here. - Ah, there. I see. Lights, camera, action. Ouch! Can you feel all the stars here in front of you? From this spot, I do. I checked their positions earlier. Start here, and then shift your weight while extending your arm. - Are you ready? - Yes. Lights, camera, action. This looks great: Cazablanke in soft focus. It's blurry. The face is in focus. It was a long day, but I want to thank you all. - Thank you. - Thank you. The different things we were thinking ended up merging together through the camera. Honestly, how was he? I really feel like he sees something. His images are very vivid. We could only imagine what they are, but that was the fun part. I think it should move in on a single planet. Then on a single terrain. That would be good. Can we start? Ready, go. Stop. 31 seconds 26. 31 seconds. Stop. I want to start from that sweeping long shot. This is the shot you took. Was it the first one? Or maybe another. Let's play it from the beginning. That's not it. That one! This is how the camera moved. The face was here. - And the camera here. - Okay. It's shooting over the planet. So if this were the star, Cazablanke would be here and the sun around here. So the camera turned like this. And this part was shot. Do we have a shot of some regular planets too? - How about in the B-roll? - The B-roll. Don't give me the whole shot. I just need the cut. Right here. - The film is science fiction. - I see. I wonder what's the best way to do this. I'll show you the video so you can get a sense. Right, that sounds good. Or, I can explain it. A video works better. Could you consider what tone works? What about sound? Am I supposed to speak in a hard or light tone? - A bit heavy. - Heavy, okay. Narrator Hiroya Ishimaru is a voice actor best known for dubbing Jackie Chan.

"This is Cazablanke." "A frontier planet..." Okay. That was perfect. Thank you for having me. Thank you! How was talking with your hero? Well... It was like talking with Jackie. Start!

So, Kato-san is playing as Ryu. Against opponent Adon... He sure looks mean. "He sure looks mean"...?! So, the characters are selected. One fireball punch after another. Lightning speed! Kato-san is on the left. Shiriagari-san, the right. I squeezed one in. Game over! What a knock-out. I was hopeless! Kato-san should've had a better opponent. You mostly relied on sound? Not mostly. Totally. Totally! Wow... Scenes 2 and 4: Edih and Lesk Meet on a Rooftop for Their Streetfight.

It really helps me understand what you're trying to create. Scenes 2 and 4: On a Rooftop Scenes 2 and 4: On a Rooftop Thank you. Scenes 2 and 4: On a Rooftop I don't want the audience to get the whole picture at once. Where the characters are? I want to show the rooftop from his point of view. I want to show the rooftop from his point of view. Edih I want to show the rooftop from his point of view. Lesk Lesk The audience sees what Edih does. The audience sees what Edih does. - They see what he's feeling... - Right. - They see what he's feeling... - Right. Takuya Shibata Producer, Just Cause Productions Takuya Shibata Producer, Just Cause Productions Takuya Shibata Producer, Just Cause Productions So we can't see the whole thing. Takuya Shibata Producer, Just Cause Productions Takuya Shibata Producer, Just Cause Productions Let me explain why. Let me explain why. That's me exactly when I'm getting my bearings. This is me, and this is how I feel then. - Touch and it exists. - Yes, that's it. I imagine myself leaning on the fence. After the coin clinks, the world becomes normal and colorful. But before someone intervenes in his world, only what Edih feels can exist. Any shot must follow this rule, I guess. I think it would be very hard to realize this world in 3D. Are you thinking of everything black? - No, I'm not. - Okay, not black. But when we try to imagine it... We really get stuck. Kato, how about creating the first scene with these blocks? This will do. That's all I need. You described Edih: "His style is his own." "His moves are unlike any existing martial art." You may have ideas that differ from the martial arts we normally do. They don't have to be concrete. Could you show us how you imagine punching or kicking? I want to incorporate your actions into the fight scenes in the movie. I don't know what difference there'd be. What I imagine could be what you imagine. Or it could be different. You have many dots on your body. Your shoulder... I meant the other. Here is a sensor on the shoulder, and here too. There are sensors everywhere. - You have one here too. - Even here. - These sensors are shown here. - Okay. The location is shown on the TV screen. - The location? - Yes, we can see it. To better reflect Kato's imagination in the film's fight scenes, they record data of his movement. they record data of his movement. - Would you show us your punch? - Sure. they record data of his movement. Like this. And this. Like this. And this one too. We can incorporate your moves. When you used to fight with sighted people, you'd blind them and beat them to a pulp. - What's that?! - Kato's glory days. Show us how you'd beat them to a pulp. Well, I just needed to punch. And then... Then... - Punch first. - No kicking? A kick would be like this, like kicking a ball. That's correct, yes. And you know, a sole kick. That's not what I thought kicking was. But once, I got kicked really hard with the sole of a shoe. So I made it my move too. Have you ever heard of martial arts made by the non-seeing? I've heard of them. How about including them in your action scenes? Yeah, maybe. Someone grabs here, and you say, "You, son of a bitch!" Grab their arm, put it under yours, and pull. First, your left arm. Can you punch? Do a hook punch like this. Try that first. Then, I'll stop it like this. I stopped it. Using my other hand, I push your punch aside. - Oh, yes. - Then... Let's switch, so you can try. Then this? And if you add a rhythm like this, it'll sound like Jackie Chan. Gimme a punch. Repeat it loudly. So next is dodging the punch. Your head goes under the arm. Like this, your body dodges the punch. You didn't know Jackie moves this way? I didn't... I had no idea he was turning the attacks aside. I just thought he was just dodging. But I could hear some slapping sounds that must've come from this move. Yeah, exactly. Let's start recording. It's ready. And rolling. Ready, action. So we're looking at the capture. The camera can see from a low-angle under the floor. Using this angle, we trick the audience. The kick can look very high. So action movies have lots of low-angles. His leg looks high. Kato-san, your kick looks super-high. Action! Pose. Okay, T- pose, please. I'd like you to understand what we can do with Previz. I'll do my best to make it easy for you to understand. Normally, we use Previz to estimate how much it might cost to use CG in a movie. Now we're using Previz for the final. It's a pre-production tool, but we are using it to create your action scenes. I think it's hard to understand without seeing. So I brought some things that help explain. I'll show you the difference between these models. - Okay. - Do you feel it? This one is fairly real. It's a hairy and rough man. He's wearing only a bandolier. So he's pretty wild. So this is the shape that Chewbacca has. And this one too. This one. Here it is. It's a soft PVC figurine. Okay. It's the same character as before, but this one is soft vinyl. The other one is a very real statue. Here's the bag. And the bandolier. He doesn't feel hairy. Color-wise, both of them are the same, what we call brown. The shapes are similar, but the details are very different. Yes. The first one you touched had hair. The hair was hard but packed in. This one uses cords to suggest hair. Oh, I see! To make real scenes in a movie, we use things like the first model. Previz can be compared to the second Chewbacca you touch, the more basic figurine. But, unless people know it's Chewbacca, it's useless. Even though Previz is simplified, it must be immediately recognizable. So, this is so different from the first one. But everyone knows it's Chewbacca. This is... a printed CG illustration by Just Cause. And this one is a picture, created with the Raised Writer. It's just a face? Yes, a face and shoulders. - Is this a jaw? - Yeah. Does it match your sense of Lesk? So his bangs are... - like this. - Yeah. Side-parted hair? A side-part, really? There's too much forehead? Yes, it's too exposed. This one is very... His hair is combed over. And here is open. I don't like that. I'll redo it so it's closer to your imagination. - Thank you. - Yes. This is a really long shot, so it might be hard to convey. All the buildings on the screen are as small as your finger. From your point of view, the camera is looking at a city nightscape. When you play with a figure, you make your favorite pose. By spreading its legs, stretching its body, or turning its neck. Maybe you play like this. The exact same thing is happening in CG now. With a figure, you do one motion, one frame at a time. It depends on the project, but now we're making it possible to shoot 24 frames/second for each second of motion. A one-minute take is 24 frames times 60 seconds. You need many keystrokes to get the characters moving. Yes. First, about the air battle: Edih attacks, but he doesn't hit Lesk. Lesk dodges. In response, Edih jumps up higher than Lesk. If you follow the line of action beyond the two characters, around here, there's a huge moon. The moon is probably bigger than you imagine. So for this frame, it's this big. The moon is a bit further. Yes. So the size will show up within the frame. It's much bigger than the moon we see from the earth. And if the frame moves to a low-angle, the huge moon will appear in the shot. This one attacks. For example, Edih is here. And if he wants to trample Edih, he'll bend back and raise his leg. Then it can try stamping on Edih. That's how the motion works. So, we show it from above. When he stamps, we shoot from below. Right, from this position. Plus, we use a low-angle. But the frame is too big. Maybe we need a smaller frame. It's very cool. - Did the frame help? - It did. Using the frame was great. Well, can I have the tissue box? What I imagined for the storyboard was just like this. Ah, okay. But, now I know. Because, to show the night view with him, we need to shoot from here. Oh, thank you. So we need to shoot like this. I wouldn't have known this. You really need to understand how to shoot things. If not, you just can't do it. Some of it exceeds my expectations, and the rest is as I imagined. Well, how can I say this... It's all much more than I expected, so I'm very happy. Sometimes, I think I'd be driving, had I eyesight. But I'm not sure. Even if I could drive, I'm not sure I'd want to. Kato tries his hand at driving for the visually impaired. It comes like this, and this is No. 2. And then No. 3.

Scene 5: On a Desert Highway, Edih and Lesk Travel by Car. Live-action/Visual Effects It's sort of like this. Scene 3: Tatiyana at United Galaxy Space Force HQ Scene 3: Tatiyana at United Galaxy Space Force HQ This could be a narrow door. Scene 3: Tatiyana at United Galaxy Space Force HQ Scene 3: Tatiyana at United Galaxy Space Force HQ Either on the right or left. Yoshinori Ban Visual Effects Yoshinori Ban Visual Effects - Like a soundproof door. - Okay. Yoshinori Ban Visual Effects We'll shoot from here. Your finger is the camera position? That's right. Where are you shooting from? - Like this? - From the black Lego? How would I know? Sorry, that's right. - He's holding the camera. - Okay. So the camera focuses on Tatiyana. Like this, right? Yeah, okay. - It's the silhouette. - It's the head. Here's the shoulder. The square thing is a backrest. I can feel it. Scene 5: Edih and Lesk Travel by Car. Higher than the roof, so this height? The camera position? - Is this the front? - Yes. One person overlaps the other like this. There's a slight overlap. Here. The camera shoots the scene from the front. If so, the light is... Let's use this one as light. I'm holding the light up here. So the light is slanting. Yes, so this side... this side of the car is in the light. - Here's shadowy. - Yes, dark. The side nearer to the camera has the shadow. That's correct. By casting light on a character, we can express their feelings. That's hard. Yes, I guess so. Director, good morning. Good morning, thanks for today. - Behind you, there's a blue screen. - Okay. That's the blue screen. - Oh, this? - Yes... It must be ten meters tall? Less than ten. - No, five meters. - Five? It's five to six meters. The big lights are coming down on the car. Okay. It's amazing. This is the camera. - Here's the monitor. - The monitor, okay. - The body is here. - Right here? Huh? This? - Oh, this is the lens. - That's correct. This is the body. It's huge! Okay. It's like a small stereo. It's pretty big, isn't it? Kazuya Hayashi Digital Imaging Technician Kazuya Hayashi Digital Imaging Technician When you composite, Kazuya Hayashi Digital Imaging Technician Kazuya Hayashi Digital Imaging Technician if there are people, targets, or motifs in front, if there are people, targets, or motifs in front, we need to cut them out precisely. The backdrop is always blank. We teach the machine that the backdrop is transparent. To do that, we use blue or green cloths. And, we instruct the machine to make this blue screen transparent. Yeah, okay. The same thing with the green. We can make the green transparent. We use the computer to do this. Is it like canceling the color? That's right. We create what we call the alpha channel. With the alpha channel, we can key out the background to create a composite. I told Kato-san how I've been trying to wean myself off my visual perceptions. I was really lucky to have met him. I'm not sure how he will direct me today. But communicating with him through his filmmaking has been incredible for me. It goes to this point? - Yeah, it's narrower than the face... - That's good. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you. How is it? - It feels good. - Is it? That's great. He's your avatar. These bangs bring me close to you. They do. Don't trust First Lieutenant Otokham too much, Edih. I Telepathed everything I could possibly know. Really? This rhythm... - Okay. - Yeah. - Can I go up front? - Front? - Is this side okay? - Yeah, go ahead. There's a mirror. Keep going. There's the camera right behind you. You have one meter, actually. - Is it okay? - Yes. Are you sitting relaxed? Well, I'm as nervous as when I actually drive. - Edih is enjoying it. - Okay. I'll close the door. Touch him like this. When I say my line? Yes, touch him as you say "Don't you need Auto-Drive?" Okay. "Don't you need Auto-Drive?" "Why bother when I've got you here?" If you stretch out your arm to the right... - There's the camera. - Ah, okay. And the car's here. Okay. Now, let's try it. Okay, Shot 2. - It's rolling. - Okay, Shot 3. Take it away. Lights, camera, action. "Lesk Otokham, First Lieutenant." "This is Captain Tatiyana." 5A Shot 6. Take it away. Lights, camera, action. The idea is, it's more like Lesk is driving. Okay. So follow things with your eyes as if you were driving. That'll look good. Okay. Then, Track 2. Take it away. Lights, camera, action. We're shooting in 6K. You can see the whole door. Well, almost all of the door. The right door, yes. We can use a close-up of Lesk's face. Okay. Later, we can make a close-up? - Yes. - Okay, then, it's fine. ...Telepathing you the route. Please do. I hate relying on... - The gun is shown on the screen. - Okay. Fess up. Basically, it's the side-shot of Edih driving. Lesk leans toward Edih. - Like this? - Yeah. He's leaning over while saying his line. Oh, good. Thank you. Director Kato, it's done. Edih is next to you now. - Other side. - Here. Thank you for such hard work. If we shoot from the front, you can see his face. That scene is later. You see... With the face, they'd realize only the voice is female. - Got it, so no face. - Right. Shot 5. Take it away. Lights, camera, action. - Kato. - Yes? Tatiyana's right eye is a bit hidden by the brim. The left eye can be hidden. I thought you didn't want that. Otherwise, he'll look like a manga character. So I tried showing his eye. - All right. - That's why. This will be audio only. "This is Captain Tatiyana Aguiari, Delta Regiment." I want a pause at a certain spot. Your tempo is too fast. Go more slowly. - You mean, on the whole? - Yes. After his line, you should pause a little. Then, say "No, Sir," with a sad face. It's rolling. Okay, Shot 3. Lights, camera, action. We've completed today's work for the film. Thank you! - Thank you. - Say something, Director. This has been a learning experience. Thank you for your patience. And thank you for your hard work. - Thank you. - Thank you. Ban-san used his storyboards to explain options of how I can shoot what. Thanks to that, I was able to create the structure. Without him, I would have been lost. It was so much fun! Can you add an octave... Can you add an octave... Kato also writes songs for the movie. Kato also writes songs for the movie.

It doesn't have the voice yet, but I made the sound like this. It sounds so real. - Like when he jumps from the fence. - It's my favorite. It sounds cool. Let me ask you something. Of course, don't hesitate. I wanted sound of the door closing. Ah, that one. I wonder where to put it. We don't have to show it. - But... - We can't leave it open. - The door's automatic. - Yeah. This one, right? I want the rustle of clothing. The swish. We can use sound to tell them apart. Can we give the feeling they're walking side by side? Scene 6: In the Hallway/Server Room, Edih and Lesk Confront the Ghost. 3DCG/AI So we'll get something 180° onto a flat surface, right?

What's the most important thing in Scene 6? We need a common understanding. We want to show that they trust each other and rely on each other's ability. So, their conversation... their position should show that one is reading the other. These would be the important points. Actually, the thing between them is also the Ghost. What is the Ghost in your mind? What is it... What does it feel like? Story-wise... it's this. It's something like a medium? - Not a medium... - In between? It could be a wall between them... or some gap in their imagination. Crow Studio I'll do a test first. Ready. It's going. Something like this. To create 3D models of the actors from the live-action scenes, they are filmed in 3D. For the scene the Ghost appears, let's decide how to show it. It's my idea... but in this movie of six scenes, here we should rein in or conclude the story. How we show the ghost in the movie could be the answer for you. In one scene of the movie, Tomohiro Hasegawa Development Manager, Luminous Productions Tomohiro Hasegawa Development Manager, Luminous Productions the character perceives space even if he doesn't see it with his eyes.

The way I sense things may be similar to AI. For instance, when I estimate a room's size, For instance, when I estimate a room's size, Yoichiro Miyake Lead AI Researcher, Luminous Productions Yoichiro Miyake Lead AI Researcher, Luminous Productions Yoichiro Miyake Lead AI Researcher, Luminous Productions I listen to my own and other voices, to people's footsteps, and to echoes. I listen to my own and other voices, to people's footsteps, and to echoes. I can guess how large the room, how high the ceiling, or if it's square or round. It's not precise, but I can get a rough perception. It's like Big Data in AI. I must operate in the same way. I analyze little by little and gain more and more. Game AI constructs a world with itself at the center. If it's a room, it collects fragmentary data. It perceives the room from its point of view. Otherwise, it won't work. It's like inflating balloons. For example, if I inflate a balloon from where I am, it would reach the ground or ceiling eventually. So I know the area I can move in. If I fill the room with balloons, they represent my potential movement. This, too, is data. That's it! That's probably what I do. Sound especially, since it's circular. That's probably how I do it. - There's a similarity. - There is. AI and I have similar modes of spatial perception. We have something in common. This room must be a server room, or a room of computers. Each machine makes the sound of its moving parts, like its fans. Things emit sound. Things emit sound. Computer fan sounds That means I perceive a space through the sounds it's making. I guess AI processes such information by ordering it one by one. Well... The speaker marks are where I put the sound source. They’ve made a simulation of the server room using an existing game platform. They’ve made a simulation of the server room using an existing game platform. They’ve made a simulation of the server room using an existing game platform. The blue sphere is where you can hear sound. The blue sphere is where you can hear sound. You first hear it faintly. As you get closer to the white, the sound gets louder. - There are sticks here. - Okay. Press down, and the character moves back and forth, left and right. Press down, and the character moves back and forth, left and right. Only the character and the sound sources are shown. Only the character and the sound sources are shown. Only the character and the sound sources are shown. Like this. Only the character and the sound sources are shown. The sound comes from here. He's showing how to do it with the other senses. If I get closer a bit... Then... - I'm aiming for the sound. - Yes, that's right. Amazing. So... the source is now in the far upper side, right? I see how it works. He's just showed us people can recognize space through sound. It's not my intention... to make all the images like that. I chose Scene 6, especially Scene 6-B. The scene the characters go inside the room. There's a reason I chose it. If I had to do the whole movie that way, I would have said no. Please don't take this the wrong way. But I wasn't so thrilled about creating scenes or shots from Edih's point of view. But they say it's more interesting if we add AI. When you described the balloons, I got excited. And I thought it's worth a try. Compared with the previous video, the only new thing is the camera. The rest is the same. the only new thing is the camera. The rest is the same. The video was made using outlines of data extracted from the server room. The video was made using outlines of data extracted from the server room. The video was made using outlines of data extracted from the server room. From this part... The video was made using outlines of data extracted from the server room. it's like his mind goes whoosh. People regard AI as something that operates all by itself. But this time, the sensors are how Kato-san feels the world. We debated how to express something using the sensors alone. When AI recognizes the world for the first time, it does what we call "search" or "sensor." So if we can visualize these, I think we'll have something unique. It looks too linguistic to me. And it's boring. It looks totally ordinary. It just looks stippled. Nothing special. That's what you want? The sense differs if I move or if I feel the whole space without moving. When you move away, computers or whatever look smaller in size. But not for me. For me, a PC is a PC, a table is a table. The size doesn't change if I get close or far. In my mind, I mean. But humans naturally do that. It just looks that way. In my imagination, the camera pulls back, and the room expands. Like this and then... like this. And at last, like this, it looks like this. - Exactly. - Am I correct? So you're here. And... like this. - What you touch, expands. - Yes, it can expand more and more. I think it can stop here. But the rest here gets expanded more and more. And now it's a square. I think my suggestion matches your explanation of AI. I think we can communicate it this way. But is it interesting as an image or something we've never seen before... If that's the point, then I can't help. SONAR and fishfinders create maps by reflecting sound waves. That's no different. Making a bird's eye shot could work. It'd be like the third person view, and easy to understand. I think it works. - Yeah, a down shot... - It's more... inner mind. It shows the image in his head. First inside his head, then out... It's true that would communicate it better. Sounds good to me. It's frustrating when I suggest something, and people say it isn't new enough. "I don't give a shit." I'm like, "What the fuck!" I gotta give up. Or this is gonna kill me. After shooting has finished, the final step is to record dialogue. Koichi Yamadera Voice Actor (Edih) Koichi Yamadera Voice Actor (Edih) Edih is more laid-back? Koichi Yamadera Voice Actor (Edih) Koichi Yamadera Voice Actor (Edih) I wonder what tone works? Koichi Yamadera Voice Actor (Edih) Koichi Yamadera Voice Actor (Edih) Edih is the cool one. Edih is the cool one. He feels like everything is a pain in the neck. He can't be bothered to do much. So, a little lazy? So the "Aye, Sir" part is a joke. He's finally getting into it. It's your stink. You officers all smell like the same detergent. Nobutoshi Kanna Voice Actor (Lesk) Nobutoshi Kanna Voice Actor (Lesk) "What? It doesn't work on him?" Nobutoshi Kanna Voice Actor (Lesk) Nobutoshi Kanna Voice Actor (Lesk) "Let's see if he likes this." Nobutoshi Kanna Voice Actor (Lesk) We record up to the coin-toss. The coin-toss, okay. Pause after saying the "we begin." - I got it. - Thanks. It seems strange to say, "What's your problem?" after saying "Wait." Yes, I agree. Edih is asking why Lesk said "Wait." So it's a rule in their game? That's right. - It's a street-battle rule. - Yes, it is. - Please get ready. - Okay. "Have it your way. I'm Telepathing you..." I messed up. Yeah, right after you breathed. - I'm so sorry. - Use this part. "I thought you might be able to feel the Ghost." "Here." "Drink this." "Yeah, thank you." Oh, for Edih's "Thank you," you wrote that he hesitates a bit. He's not sure... Lesk gives him a water bottle and says, "Drink this." But Edih doesn't see it. - He hasn't entirely trusted Lesk yet. - I see. "Your eyes..." "They don't see. Who gives a shit?" "So that's why..." "I lobbed a visual hallucination at you using my Telepathy." "Now it makes sense." In my opinion... it was perfect. I felt the rhythm was good. Really. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Great job. - You too. I was curious how Kato-san would make a movie. I knew he must have a very keen sense about sound. If we slack off, he'll know instantly. Chosen by such a director, we're really honored. I agree. But he can see right through us. We were actually quite nervous. Really? Sometimes they say you can never adapt a movie from a certain book. The images are already in our minds. Yes. But as a voice actor... of course, your movie has images too... I hope my voice makes the audience imagine more than what they see. We do, yes. You gave me goose bumps. Really? I'm really happy. I struggled to stay calm. - Really? - Yes. Kato-san, may I ask your sense of this character? As a soldier, Tatiyana is resolute? As a soldier, Tatiyana is resolute? Mamiko Noto Voice Actor (Tatiyana) Mamiko Noto Voice Actor (Tatiyana) Mamiko Noto Voice Actor (Tatiyana) - Yes, like a soldier. - Okay, a military tone, then. - Yes, like a soldier. - Okay, a military tone, then. When she opens up, she's still like that? Yes, she is. Okay. - We'll begin from Scene 3. Get ready. - Yes, okay. "It's the Ghost, Sir." "It broke into our server in Blue Cityside." Can you perform those lines more gently? Oh, gentler. Okay, I'll do that. Excuse me. About the next two lines, may I try performing them differently? - I'd love to hear that. - Thank you. "You woke up?" I dunno what happened. "I was following you via camera, but the image cut out." - Please wait a sec. - Okay. What do you think? This is it. Yes. The way you performed... That's what I imagined. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you! Thank you! - Thank you very much! My hands are cold because I'm nervous. - It was a real pleasure. - It was my honor to have you. Thank you. Your movie used so many media. CG, live action, and anime. Even though the media changes, the characters stay the same. This felt new to me. Each time I was surprised, I got more pulled in. - I enjoyed it. - Thank you. I enjoyed it very much. I can't wait to see the complete movie. And I want to see a sequel! Really? Thank you so much. What's Connor's personality like? - He's merciless. - Merciless. Always heartless. Heartless... How old is he? He is quite old. And has a deep voice. And has a deep voice. Robert Harris Voice Actor (Connor) Robert Harris Voice Actor (Connor) Robert Harris Voice Actor (Connor) He speaks with a deep voice. Okay. Robert Harris Voice Actor (Connor) So he's 55 years old. - He's like a career soldier? - Right. He'll never go to the front line. - He's a major. - Okay. But he has stayed alive, so he's done bad things. - Maybe. - Right? Please take a seat there. - The glass is here? - Yes. I feel very at home here. - Really? - Yeah. I've been in booths for decades. - He means the radio. - That's right! - J-Wave, too? - Yeah. "Major Connor here." Sorry for interrupting. "No problem. But this will be audio only." "What are you waiting for?" "Send in a platoon. Have them prevent any leak." May I ask you to perform more calmly in the latter half? Calmly? Okay. Maybe he doesn't get excited so much. - That's right. - Yeah, okay. "If the UGSF can't get in there, find someone who can." "I'll take responsibility." "Get out there and find someone." It was awesome. I love your deep, low-key voice. It was so Connor. Really. This is his first film. Now he's bitten the apple, maybe he'll try a longer one. That's not... - No? - I mean... It's not that I don't want to, but life isn't so generous. But you want to make it. If possible, yes. - The sequel to this movie? - Yeah. Especially after hearing people want to see the sequel. I wanna see it too. Make one! This is Cazablanke. A frontier planet owned by the United Galaxy Space Force. Population: about a million. More than 90% of the residents are Earthian-hybrids: mainly soldiers and their families. Everyone else must struggle to keep the soldiers' world alive. What a weakling! And your clothes... You look like shit. I wear what feels good. Since I'm not a soldier like you, I don't need to judge by appearances. I'd die before becoming UGSF beefcake. You can tell I'm a soldier? It's your stink. You officers all smell like the same detergent. You dog! Stop the talk! What're we waitin' for? When the coin hits, we begin. He's not bad! But can he take this? What'd he just hit me with? Some kinda sound strike? What? It doesn't work on him? Let's see if he likes this. - Wait! - Wait! What's your problem? What's your problem? Wait... Your eyes... They don't see. Who gives a shit? So that's why... I lobbed a visual hallucination at you using my Telepathy. Now it makes sense. I felt something like a headache. You wanna use your Sense for real? For real? For the United Galaxy Space Force. Spare me the military crap. Just hear me out... Calling: Connor Major Connor here. Sorry for interrupting, Sir. No problem. But this will be audio only. This is Captain Tatiyana Aguiari, Delta Regiment. This is urgent information. What is it? Spit it out. It's the Ghost, Sir. It broke into our server in Blue Cityside. Our secret data is at risk of being leaked. The Ghost did? The Ghost has penetrated and destroyed all our security barriers. What are you waiting for? Send in a platoon. Have them prevent any leak. My men are refusing. They're afraid of the Ghost. If they can't see the enemy, they're sitting ducks. A bunch of cowards... Do you have a plan, then? No, Sir. I'm afraid not. The men are no use. There's no intel. If the UGSF can't get in there, find someone who can. I'll take responsibility. Get out there and find someone. Aye, Sir. I thought you might be able to feel the Ghost. Here. Drink this. Yeah, thank you. It's a good offer, right? The Ghost would be a fun target for you. Okay... It sounds pretty interesting. I'm in. On one condition... You come too. I use my Sense to capture it. Then you read it with your Telepathy. Don't you need Auto-Drive? Why bother when I've got you here? Have it your way. I'm Telepathing you the route. Please do. I hate relying on the 'puters for everything. Lesk Otokham, First Lieutenant. This is Captain Tatiyana. I'm on my way to the site. He's with me. Edih, how do you do? I'm Captain Tatiyana. Thanks for helping. My pleasure. Good to meet ya. You have a hot voice. That sultry voice... leads you right into the arms of a handsome boy. Lesk, I know you Telepathed something to Edih just now. Fess up to it. No, Ma'am. I just conveyed the truth. Earthian-hybrids need more than words to understand anything more complex than two genders. Are you fibbing? Fine, then... Don't trust First Lieutenant Otokham too much, Edih. He's prone to misusing his ability. Got it. I'll keep my guard up. By the way, Lesk, how much did you tell him about the Ghost? Everything I could possibly know. Really? Telepathy sure is convenient. We're just arriving at Blue Cityside. Copy that. Please be careful, guys. If you feel danger, you can abandon the mission. Edih, keep an eye on Lesk. Aye, Sir. You sound like a soldier... It's fun to pretend. What do you Sense? Nothin'. Nothing here, too. Clear. It's in here. Where? Read my image as I close in. Okay. Someone's here. The sensations are fusing... You woke up? I dunno what happened. I was following you via camera, but the image cut out. I need a report from you now. I'm not feeling my buddy here, or the Ghost. Something's there. Director and Writer Hideyuki Kato Assistant Director and Co-Producer Makoto Sasaki Producer Miyuki Tanaka What is this? It's saké, okay. What cute kitty make-up! Her mom did it. Is it okay? Thanks. - They look good. - Made by Kato-san. - They taste delicious. - So good. It's yummy. Ask Kato-kun to cuddle you. I want Daddy! I want Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! You don't like that? Okay, okay. Okay, I'm sorry. So, the movie is done. What did you think on seeing it? I say "see" on purpose. Don't gimme that. What did you think on seeing it, Sasaki? You want my opinion? Well, I liked it. But your visual senses don't let you see it. So, as someone sighted, I'm not really sure if it was what you imagined. But it's a finished movie, and I think it's good as it is. What's important is whether it's a good movie or not. Did you enjoy it? I did. What did you enjoy? Well, that's... I hate to say it... but it was the dubbing. If you ask me... I'll admit it. And what was that cat, after all? You dare ask me that?
