Drink more. No, you rest. Just sit a while. Hey, what happened? Oh, it's bleeding. No one is here, are they? When I searched, I couldn't find anyone. Hello. Is there a first aid box? No. Wait a minute. It will take a little more time. Is it hurting? It will be fine after a little while. Where did SP go? Why didn't you go? Nothing... Are you his younger daughter? Don't you know your mother tongue? That is... I mean, you don't know your mother tongue. I know, but I'm a Malayali. You can speak Malayalam, I know Malayalam very well. Oh, don't you know English, sir? Last week, I appointed an English teacher, I will learn. Sir, you are funny. We have a beautiful language like Tamil. Why use another language like English? British people left here 67 years ago. So why do we appreciate that language? Some people only speak it. Sir, may I know who you are? Are you Kamala Hassan in an Indian movie? I'm neither Rajani nor Kamal, I'm an Indian, a Tamilian. All right, Mr. Tamilian. I've only spoken with you in Tamil. You are speaking Tamil very nicely. I have seen many Tamil movies. I will repeat some dialogue from Talaivar. "Kanna. Pigs only come in groups. But Lions come alone. I'm a lion." Okay, what's your name? I'm Nivedita Hariharan from Trivandrum. I'm a journalist. -Are you a news reporter? -Yes. Do you know a public prosecutor, Avirazhakan, who works at the Chennai High Court? I don't know. He was successful in most of the sensational cases. No, sir, I don't know about him. You should know about him because you are journalist. You should be aware of everything. I just joined as a trainee reporter after my internship. That's why I don't have a vast knowledge about everything. -Oh, is that it? -Yes. But now I'm writing a special feature, I came here to interview Uncle SP for work. What's the matter? There are so many people who are in jail without having committed a crime. They need justice. They have to be let out. Their stories should be known by the common people and the authorities. So, I'm going to do a feature about their stories. People denied by justice. Very good. If you do it seriously, it'll become breaking news. Yes, sir. That is my aim. Can I see this? Sir, who is this Avirazhakan? Why did you ask me if I knew about him? You should know about him. It's no problem, you don't know him. But from now on, you should. Why? You will get lots of information which will help your feature. Is that true? Can I get an appointment to see him? Do you have his contact number? You are Avirazhakan, aren't you? Tell me, sir, are you Avirazhakan? Yes, you are. Is that correct? You are Avirazhakan. Only you. Sorry, sir. It is true that I didn't know about you earlier. But when we meet next time, I will know everything about you. I want to ask you something. What is that? Why did you climb up the tree? I climbed up to take a photo. Why did you climb up to take a photo? When I was in the courtyard, I saw a nest up in the tree. A small bird was crying in that nest. I thought it would be nice to get a close up. I got a photo when I climbed up the tree, but my foot slipped, and I fell down. Are you mad? Oh, you've found that already. Everyone is always telling me that. I'm mad. -I had a nickname in my college. -What was it? It was Crack. Crack! It's a suitable name for you. I don't have a problem with that name. My subject of interest is adventurous work. Others think it's mad. What will I do? Can't do anything. -What is that? -Look here. I did it taking this photo. You took some risk to take this photo. But you captured it very nicely. Yes. For life to be thrilling, it needs someone to be crack. This crack is my courage. Each photo tells a story. Not only behind this photo, sir. In my life, there's a story behind everything. One minute, my phone is ringing. I'll go now. It was Papa's call. I didn't call him when I got here. Whose child is this? -This child? -Yes. This boy is their child. This is Stephen Alexander, eldest son of SP. This is his wife, Sangeetha Stephen. Yes. They did have an inter-caste marriage for love. I only know that much about them. Is he not here? No, they are staying abroad. They are coming today. Uncle went to the airport to pick them up. This child is very cute, isn't he? Yes, he is very cute. Hey, hello, what happened? No... I had a close friend, Kanakaraman, in Chennai, whose child was just like this. Very cute. Like a baby goddess. She likes me very much. I also... It's not just me, everyone likes her. God also likes her very much. So he called her up faster. What happened? -She died. -How? That is a story. A sad story. Kanakaraman was working for an IT company in Chennai. A beautiful lady was there on their team. She loved him very much. They married within six months and had two kids within three years. They had five years of happy and prosperous life. At that time... one of their friends joined the company who had worked there before. Kanakaraman's wife renewed her relationship with the friend. But he couldn't understand anything in the beginning. He thought that it was common in the IT profession. But he trusted her a lot. But... But when he found out she abused his trust... he was totally broken. Do you know what the biggest pain in the world is? Our dearest ones cheating on us. When he was hurt by his beloved wife... Who can suffer that pain? But Kanakaraman adjusted to that also. He was madly in love with her. But she forgot her sweet kids and lovable husband. She gave up on them and went with her new lover. He became brokenhearted. But Kanakaraman searched and found her. He'd forgotten everything that happened. and asked her to go with him. He told her he couldn't live without her. Our two kids were searching for their mom. He begged her to come with them. But she wanted her lover. The new lover and friends beat him badly. His mind and body were broken in a similar manner. The kids cried while searching for their mom. That moment... he couldn't bear the great pain he had suffered. He poisoned his two kids... and himself as well. But he didn't die. The two kids... passed away. When he found out about the loss of his children, he went mad. After that... he was jailed for 12 years for the murder of his two children. For those dreadful 12 years, his life was like death. After 12 years, he was released from Jail. He came back. What mistake did he make? He loved a lady and married her. Is that a mistake? Or his readiness to forgive, was that a mistake? I don't know. It's not suitable for your feature. When I saw the kid, I remembered everything. I was ashamed when I found out he was Advocate Avirazhakan. I don't know what he thought about me. Nothing like that. You never forget him because you need him. I think like that. In the fight between two political groups in Salem, offices were smashed. Two were arrested for the alleged murder. Siya, I mailed it. Call me after checking it if you have any corrections. Okay, dear, I will call you. Yes. Nivedita, Aswin is calling you. Okay, cut that call, I'll call back. Hello. Oh, I took the call by mistake. Wait, I'll come. -Hello. -Hello, Neethu. Yes, one minute, I'll give it to her. Who are you? Who's speaking? I'm her friend. -Which friend? -Come, come. Speak, speak. You told me you're alone there, who is there? That's Uncle's friend. But he told me that he is your friend. Is it tasty? Yes. Call and talk. No, I will call later. Is he your boyfriend? Yes. Do you fight with him? Not that much, not seriously. We're always like that. Dear, speak with him. Talk. Yes, Aswin. Neethu, this is too much. How many times have I called you? Why don't you speak to me? Are you that busy? You always have an excuse for everything. Please leave me alone. I'm busy. I'm going to hang up. Is the fighting over? No, it will get worse. Sometimes some people are like that. He is showing his affection towards you. It's not affection, it's madness. If you don't want this love, you can leave, right? I can't. He made me his life. If so, don't you feel the same? I also like him in my life. I like him very much, he knows that very well. But, I don't know, why does he behave without any trust? Sir, you tell me hope is life. Do you know one thing? What is that? The microorganisms in the soil... Oh, an earthworm? How to say it in English... It is the only organism that never cheats on its partner. But all other things, including husbands and wives, will cheat. They will cheat not just once but any time. Family life is like a game, a little carelessness leads it astray. Sir, are you married? I don't have any hope for that. Why? Did you love someone that left you? Leave it at that. Why did you say you don't have hope? Mad... Move your leg. I will move my leg if you answer my question. -Sir, may I ask one thing? -What's that? Who is the mad one between us? If anyone did this, they'd become a "Crack." -Were you born like this? -Yes. Sir, why did you come to meet Uncle SP? How do you know him? We worked at the same place ten years ago. He got a transfer here. I went to Chennai. After that, no contact. He was very busy with his job. It's been 10 years since I last saw him. So I didn't inform him of my arrival. It's a surprise. -Oh, is it? -Yes. So there's no need to tell Uncle about you when he calls me, right? No, don't tell him. Maybe he can't remember. Uncle can easily understand you. He will say, "Hey, are you Arivu?" We will hear something like that. What time will he be here? They've left there now. He will be here tonight. Then I'm going, okay? Where? I want to get a room in the city, I'll meet him tomorrow morning after I've freshened up. I'm bored here. I got some energy after you arrived. It's okay, we'll meet tomorrow. No, it's too late, I want to go by bus. It's very hard to find a room. I will drop you off. No need, I'll go. No problem for me. I'll drop you off, sir. No, dear, I will go. Can I drop you at the bus stop? No need. You don't need to say anything, I will drop you off, come on. Okay, I will open the gate. Wait, sir. Why are you leaving now? What? Uncle and the family will be here tonight. When Uncle sees you he will be emotional. He will tell you to stay here. Oh, God. He will be emotional when he sees me. Then what will I do? Then why are you going? They will only get here tonight. I will sit with you until tonight. Why, sir? Do I look that dreadful? No, sir. If Aswin knew, he would be doubtful... then it would be a problem for you both. Don't worry about that. We should be good in our own mind. Okay, as you wish. Come. One minute, okay? Yes, Siya, are there any corrections? It's not like that. When he talks about an unwanted matter, I think it will lead to a big fight. I dropped his call because of that. Problems will start afterwards. Why is he coming here? Only he knows that. His problem is that someone else is here. Advocate Avirazhakan. Let's look at the local news in detail. Poor people want to remove the interest on their loans and also close all of the farmers' loans. Kalpakkam in Kanchipuram Village, one man died from an electric shock. Women can't stay in their homes, lonely, because when they hear the news about the murders they suffer from anxiety. Is replying also becoming fighting? No, it's not like that. A lie. No, sir. Listen here... if you tell a lie sincerely, then it's easy to believe. Okay, sir, I will tell a lie sincerely next time, okay? Sir, can you play that English movie? Which movie is this? Shutter Island. One of my favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movies. DiCaprio is a mental patient in this movie. -Is he mental? -Yes. He seems to be normal but he thinks that he is another person. It's like the condition, "split personality disorder." Sometimes, he behaved like another person without knowing himself. Slowly, he changed into another person. Some patients committed murder in real life too. Don't make fun. Don't scare me. What is it, sir, you're a man, right? Who are you? There is no difference between men and women when it comes to craziness. When I saw you, I thought that you weren't normal. Tell me the truth. You don't become violent, do you? Are you journalist Nivedita or another person? I wasn't like that up until now but I'm not sure about the future. New decorations have been imported from America for Christmas. So many in such a short amount of time. New decorations are being put up in New York City. Sir, can you help me? What's that? We can make it a colorful surprise for SP. It's a nice idea, right? To do what? Switch off the TV and follow me. I told you. Now, come. Oh, that's why you won't let me go. Not just this, lots of things. Hurting... You go and buy those things. Okay, I'll be back soon. For what? For everything. I didn't think in my wildest dreams that today would be this beautiful. You've become my good friend. Beyond that, you support all my craziness and you did all this for me. Really, I wondered. Sometimes, it will be like that. We will wonder when our thoughts become true. No one can predict what will happen in the next moment. Sir, give me your cell phone number. For what? Just give it, sir. Tell me, sir. When I call you, you come inside. Till that time you stay right here, okay? Is she switching off all the lights? How is this? Very beautiful. What is this? My father sent it for Uncle. You are the luckiest person to drink this on this auspicious day. This is for this beautiful day and, beyond that, your careful affection towards me. It is for you. Thank you for you and your craziness. -Cheers. -Cheers. Yes? I've never seen a girl like you in my 40 years of life. Why, sir? Am I that bad? Hey, don't be funny, I'm being serious. Okay, you can tell me. In my view, you are a small goddess. You are an ever-happy small goddess who forgot all her pains and fears. Everyone who talks to you for a while likes you. Really. Why did you say that you did not know about Avirazhakan and now you are saying you know about him? You should know. It's on a need-to-know basis. Then you can tell me, sir. Do you know which painting this is? I know. The Last Supper by da Vinci. Da Vinci portrayed it beautifully. Jesus as the symbol of sacrifice and Judas as injustice. One day, he met the devotional singer of a church. His face was innocent, like God. He brought him home and made him his companion. Over the next three years, he met more people. But he couldn't find the suitable face for Judas. He waited for a long time. One day he met a drunkard in the road. His face revealed anger, craziness and corruption. He drew the picture of Judas with his face. When that drunkard gained consciousness, he started to cry. Da Vinci asked him, "Why are you crying?" He said he could see Jesus in this picture. And he started to cry. Then, da Vinci asked him where and when he saw it. He said that he used to be a church singer. He said "Before, you brought me and drew the face of Jesus. That time, I was Jesus. Now, I've changed into Judas." And he started to cry. It's not our decision, what truth is. A human being contains both Jesus and Judas. Only his lifestyle changed him. The world doesn't know about Avirazhakan's real face. Everyone knows his fake face. That Avirazhakan is a bad man. Are you a fraud? I don't believe it. Okay, I will tell you one more story. Again? Tell it fast, sir. This happened 10 years ago. It's like a story... It would be better if you added it to your feature. Can I record this? Of course. Okay, I will be back in five minutes. What happened? Clip this on to your shirt. Okay. Okay, sir. Relax and start telling it to the camera. This is a real story. It happened in a small village. Maize and sugar cane is the main business in this village. There was a strong love affair in that sugar cane field. This is the love story of Thenmozhi and Kathirasan. The hero and heroine of this story. They had a lot of religious fights similar to other villages. Thenmozhi belonged to an upper-class family. Kathirasan belonged to a poor lower-class family. When the village found out about the relationship, it became a big problem. Both of them left their village. After that incident, the high-class people tortured the lower-class people. In this incident, 23 people were killed, including all of Kathirasan's relatives. When Kathirasan heard about this, she became violent. All the times she found caring in her father, love in her mother and naughtiness in her sister... All these she now found in Thenmozhi. Thenmozhi is the world's... No, Thenmozhi became his world. Sometimes God is like heavy rain. That also happened here. That changed his life. Kathirasan couldn't become a father. Doctors told him that. Kathirasan's life became horrible. It really insulted him. At that time, Kathirasan found out that Thenmozhi was meeting with her father. That incident led to regular fights between them. That time, he knew what the matter was. Thenmozhi was pregnant. Kathirasan was filled with happiness, but he thought about the words of... three doctors that said he couldn't have a baby. How did Thenmozhi get pregnant? "This is not my child," he thought. "Thenmozhi cheated on me." Oh, my god. Things changed. On one hand, he was madly in love with Thenmozhi but on the other hand, he wanted to kill her. He became depressed. After three, four months... one day... Thenmozhi died. How? He strangled her because she was cheating and told the police she hanged herself. The court sent him to jail. Bloody killer, don't let him go free, he should be hanged. No. Thenmozhi was not killed by Kathirasan. Then who? She committed suicide. Because of Thenmozhi's father's anger towards Kathirasan, he gave the police money and changed it to a murder case. At that time, this case was handled by DYSP Alexander Koshi. Advocate Avirazhakan appeared for Kathirasan. The one who showed his client to Thenmozhi's father for money. That cruel Judas' name was Avirazhakan. Why did you do it like that? I don't know. I didn't know how it happened till now. Remove that. Will you have any problems if it gets out? Why should we be scared about telling the truth? Pity. Kathirasan... Which jail does he belong to? Kanakaraman and Kathirasan are in Madhura Central Jail. They will be released soon. I want to tell SP about it. That is the purpose of my visit. Sir, are you scared of him? Do you know which emotion a man can't suppress? I know. It's his appetite. Revenge. We can control our appetite, but we can't control revenge. Are you scared Kathirasan will kill you and Uncle SP? If he decided to kill us, no one could stop him. He will kill. -Be careful! -What? Thenmozhi was killed. Kathirasan killed Thenmozhi. Thenmozhi was killed. For the couples who have come for their honeymoon, it will be difficult to celebrate due to the new judgement passed. Why did Thenmozhi commit suicide? Because she felt guilty. Because she cheated on her husband. I can't believe that. Kanakaraman's wife cheated on him, but Thenmozhi didn't cheat on him. If Thenmozhi was that kind of girl, she would've gone with her father when he called her. She knew that a life with Kathirasan would be very difficult. But she was madly in love with Kathirasan. That kind of girl would never cheat on Kathirasan. So, the doctors told a lie, did they? Their reports were fake, right? Doctors may be like that. But God's decision is final. If God decides, anything can happen. Okay, anything can happen. Will she get pregnant without his contact? She is not Kunti Devi or Kanya Mariyame. She can't have a divine pregnancy. Thenmozhi was a normal woman. All men are like that, doubtful about birth. Okay, okay. You are the only one without a doubt. You should know one thing. No matter what a man is - a fraud, a thief, a drunkard or even a killer - his love will be sincere. His love and affection towards his lover, you called it possessiveness or doubt. All men think like that. They don't know how to understand and respect a woman. They always think that their wife should be their slave. You also think that. I'm not like that. Because I'm your friend, right? If I was your lover or wife, you would think like that. Then you'd be angry and doubtful. If so, even for a moment, can't you go without scolding me? Why can't... I can. You should be like that. If you can give respect, you can take respect. Okay, if I give it, I will get it back. But you can't do that. That's why you are still unmarried. Do one thing. Listen! If you became my wife, then you would know how to give respect and earn respect. Simply saying blah, blah... If you do this, you are thought to be married. If I keep it in my palm, will it burn? When she wakes up, you can throw it. -Enough, my girl. Don't blow now. -Don't hurry, let the women leave. Okay, we will do it like that. What? We will be married together. Uncle and Aunty will be delayed. 'Till that time, you are Kathirasan and I'm Thenmozhi, acting as husband and wife. But don't touch. If you speak or scold me before that, you will fail and Kathirasan is the killer. However, if I speak or scold you, Thenmozhi's side is wrong. Okay, let's play. Didn't you take your medicine last night? No, can you do it or not? I can't. You don't know what you're saying and doing... You are mad. Yes, I'm mad. But I'm courageous. You're intelligent, but a coward. That's why you are talking like that. Yes, yes. You are like Jhansi Rani. Go, dear. Go and do your job. How did she become a journalist? Is it a lie or not? -What happened? -It fell over. Leave it there, I will take it. Move your hand. -Bring a piece of paper. -Okay. You look very beautiful, lady. I will come back after throwing this away. Okay. Kathir... I just called for you. I wanted to know if you would react or not if I called you that. Uncle called me before. His flight is delayed for two hours. He told me he'd get here around 11:30. Then where is that advocate? Did he go? He will go after meeting with Uncle. If we can give respect and importance to the small deeds of others... we should be kind-hearted. He has that. Let him come. Whatever he wants to do, he can do. It's me, leave me alone. It's hurting. Oh, my God, it was just for fun, why did you do that? My God... I came here to ask for help, but you seemed to have found someone outside, so I thought I'd frighten you. What do you need help with? If you like chapati with dinner, can you cut some onions? Is that the help? When you cut onions, your eyes burn. That's why. -What is that for? -What? Why did you put onion behind your ear? Oh, that. Come here. Come here. -This is what it's for? -Nothing will happen. Why keep it here? Come and cut this. -No, I can't. -Come. It will burn my eyes. Come, nothing will happen. -If I touch it, it'll be a problem for me. -Cut it. Wow. What? My eyes are not burning. That is it. How? It's like that. Because we kept some behind our ears. My mom's always saying-- What? "Tasty food is the only easy way to a man's heart." Mom cooks well. Papa eats very well. Because of that, there are no arguments between them. But I'm not like that. If anybody gave me tasty food, I would eat well. What happened? Nothing. You said your eyes weren't burning. Now they're reddish. No, something's in my eyes. What is that? Show them to me. Let me look. -No. -Show them to me. -It's no problem. -Show me. It's gone. Theni. Chapatis are ready, come and have some. How is it? It’s very tasty. Time is not the main thing. If I'm in a good mood, everything is tasty. How come? When we prepare food for anyone... our love towards them, that love increases the taste of the food. In this world, a mother's love is most precious, so a mother's food is the tastiest. Correct. -Is it? -Yes, sir. Then how did this chapati become so tasty? It contains Thenmozhi's affection towards Kathirasan, so it is very tasty. What happened? The dog has been barking for a long time. Why? Are you afraid Kathirasan will come here? Thenmozhi had one secret lover. I thought he came here. Caesar is an animal. He can survive revenge but not hunger. You have it. I will feed him and come back. Why are you barking? You should be quiet and sleep after eating this. I told you he was hungry. That's why he was barking. Now, look, no barking because he's not hungry. You came in my evening dream By removing foldings You came slowly in my mind You came in my evening dream By removing foldings You came slowly in my mind Through mystical white glass doors Through mystical white glass doors Blinking your eyes like candle light You came in front of me like Your sweet sound is like The murmuring of birds Light, sweet voice showering in the ear The breeze of memory patting me The love gliding in the air Fly into my heart Oh, my sweet Jasmine Can you hug me slowly?

They're not okay? Tell him to come here. Tell him in front of me. Who? Your secret lover in the room, tell him to come here. Oh, him. He's asleep because he is too tired. I can't call him now. He is overreacting. Don't try to cheat me. He had been working at Chennai High Court for the past eight years. Famous public prosecutor Avirazhakan has been killed. He had been working at Chennai High Court for the past eight years. People have tried to kill him two or three times before. Police found his body two hours ago. But they said he was killed 24 hours ago. Police don't have any evidence on the killer or the way he was killed. News headlines again-- Is he that Avirazhakan? Whenever you tell a lie, tell it sincerely. Judas Avirazhakan. -Kathir. -Theni. Thenmozhi had a secret lover. He came here. Now... call him, fast, call him! Call him! Hurry, ask him to come now. Are you trying to fool me? Call him now! Bring him to me! Did you cheat on me? Please, I don't know. I don't know about the person you are talking about. -Thenmozhi... -No one is here. Don't cry, Thenmozhi. Don't cry, please. I can't suffer your sorrow. Please! Are you acting? Is it drama? I will not leave you. Don't make a noise! You said the dog was barking because of hunger. Now, what happened? You tell me. Why is it barking now? He is there. Tell him to come here. Tell him to come quickly. Tell him to come! Come! Come! Ask him to come! Where did you hide him? Where? I will come back. I will come back after I've killed him. -Dear, what happened to your cell phone? -Papa, help me. Please, leave me alone. From the depth of my heart What came and made me smitten?

Wake up, listen. Listen, it is the sound of our child! It is our child. Listen, listen. I can hear our baby. It's our baby. Yes, this baby is ours. Our baby? Yes, this baby is ours. Our baby? Wow, I became a father! I'm going to be a father! If you give birth to a baby, I become a father. How can I be a father? The doctors told me something different. No, it's not like that. Not me. I can't become a father. I can't be... Did you cheat on me? Oh, God, why did you make me like this? Don't make a noise! Please, stop! I will kill you! My head is hurting because of the sound! You cheated, right? You cheated on me? No, Kathir, I didn't cheat on you. This baby is yours. Our baby? I'm not Thenmozhi. I'm not Thenmozhi. I'm not Thenmozhi. Be quiet. Please, don't kill me. Don't cry, it will kill me. Do you think I'm a fool? Doctors said I can't have a child. If it's not mine, then whose baby is it? Whose baby is it? Whose is it? Who? Who? Please, don't kill me! Yes, I will not kill you. Don't cry. Don't be scared, you are my beloved. How could I kill you? I will not kill you. I will not kill you. Kathirasan is in Madhura Central Jail with Kanakaraman.
