CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. Narrator: THIS IS OPERATION EXPERIMENT, A SECRET BASE FAR NORTH OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. EXPERIMENT WAS THE CODE NAME FOR THIS TOP-PRIORITY SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION. THESE MEN ARRIVED HERE ON X-DAY MINUS 60. IT HAS TAKEN THEM THE FULL 2 MONTHS TO GET READY. TODAY IS X-DAY. IT IS NOW H-HOUR MINUS 59 MINUTES. THERE IS LESS THAN AN HOUR LEFT. THE PLANE MUST ARRIVE AT ITS RENDEZVOUS 200 MILES AWAY IN EXACTLY 58 MINUTES. THERE CAN BE NO MARGIN FOR ERROR. THERE CAN BE NO SECOND CHANCE. THIS IS THE RENDEZVOUS, THE FORWARD OBSERVATION POST WHERE SCIENTISTS AND THEIR AIDS DOUBLE-CHECK THEIR EQUIPMENT AND WAIT FOR THE PLANE'S APPROACH. IT IS NOW H-HOUR MINUS 81 SECONDS. AT H-HOUR MINUS 75 SECONDS, THE RADAR ANTENNA FLASHES THE WORD. THERE IT IS... AZIMUTH 63 DEGREES. AIRPLANE SIGHTED. 13 HOURS, 11 MINUTES... AZIMUTH 63 DEGREES, SPEED APPROXIMATELY 350 MILES PER HOUR. Narrator: PROFESSOR TOM NESBITT AND COLONEL JOHN EVANS, MILITARY LIAISON, TENSELY WAIT. THE TIMING IS PERFECT THUS FAR. IT IS NOW H-HOUR MINUS 56 SECONDS. EVERY MAN HERE KNOWS HIS JOB. HE DOES IT QUICKLY, EFFICIENTLY, SILENTLY. THE MEN ARE READY, THE EQUIPMENT IS READY. IT IS NOW H-HOUR MINUS 52 SECONDS. OPERATION EXPERIMENT TO Y-3-4-7. OPERATION EXPERIMENT TO Y-3-4-7. OVER. Y-3-4-7 TO OPERATION EXPERIMENT. NOW LEVELING OFF. GROUND SPEED 360. APPROACHING I.P. Narrator: I.P. MEANS INITIAL POINT. THE NEXT 26 SECONDS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THESE MEN HAVE SUCCEEDED OR FAILED. NOW WE COUNT THE SECONDS. Narrator: 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... CHARLIE, LOOK. COLONEL EVANS, THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ON THE RADAR SCREEN. WHAT'S THE MATTER, CHARLIE? RIGHT HERE, SIR. A FOREIGN OBJECT. IT'S GONE. WHAT'S GONE? I DON'T KNOW, SIR. IT SILHOUETTED LIKE 500 TONS AT LEAST. WHERE IS IT, THEN? I DON'T KNOW, SIR. ARE YOU SURE WE SAW IT? WE SAW SOMETHING. MAYBE THE SHOCK TOSSED SOMETHING IN FRONT OF THE ANTENNA. YEAH. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN IT. 8 WEEKS OF PREPARATION AND IT'S ALL OVER IN A SECOND, HUH? JACK, WHEN ENERGY OF THAT MAGNITUDE IS RELEASED, IT'S NEVER OVER. WHAT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ALL THESE ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS AND TESTS WILL BE, ONLY TIME CAN TELL. YOU MEAN SCIENTISTS CAN'T TELL, HUH? THE WORLD'S BEEN HERE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS. MAN'S BEEN WALKING UPRIGHT FOR A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME. MENTALLY WE'RE STILL CRAWLING. THIS TEST WILL ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE. WOULDN'T YOU SAY SO, RITCHIE? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME ONE OF THESE THINGS GOES OFF, I FEEL AS IF WE WERE HELPING TO WRITE THE FIRST CHAPTER OF A NEW GENESIS. LET'S HOPE WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES WRITING THE LAST CHAPTER OF THE OLD ONE. YOU SOUND LIKE A MAN THAT'S SCARED, TOM. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M NOT? HERE ARE THE FIGURES, TOM. WE'LL BE READY TO GO UP TO THE FORWARD OBSERVATION POST IN ABOUT AN HOUR. GOOD. LOOMIS? YES, SIR? GET THE EQUIPMENT READY. YES, SIR. AND YOU, GENTLEMEN, THE MOMENT YOUR GEIGER COUNTERS INDICATE HEAVY RADIATION, YOU'RE TO TURN BACK. TURN BACK? COLONEL, WE'LL RUN BACK. THERE ISN'T A HERO IN THE CROWD. POST 16. SHALL WE TRY TO GO AROUND, SIR? NO. WAIT HERE FOR US. WE'LL GO UP ON FOOT. WHAT'S YOUR READING? 19.7. WE'D BETTER GET OUT. I'LL CHECK POST 17. YOU TAKE 18, AND I'LL MEET YOU BACK HERE. MAKE IT FAST. SERGEANT WILLISTEAD. WHAT? BUT THEY'VE GONE ON FOOT. OK. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THERE'S A BLIZZARD COMING UP. TOM! TOM! TOM! TOM! AAH! OHH... OOHH... TOM! TOM! I CAN'T MOVE! SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY LEG! I'M COMING DOWN! HAVE THEY REPORTED BACK YET? NO, NOT YET. WE'RE WAITING. TOM, TOM... GET OUT, TOM. MONSTER. PREHISTORIC MONSTER. QUIET, QUIET. DON'T STRUGGLE. AAH... I'LL GET YOU OUT, GEORGE. DON'T WORRY. DOC! HEY! DOC! PUT HIM RIGHT OVER HERE. GIVE ME MY BAG, PLEASE. YES, SIR. AND GET SOME BLANKETS OFF THOSE OTHER BEDS. HOW IS HE? WHERE'S PROFESSOR RITCHIE? STILL MISSING, SIR. WHAT HAPPENED? WE DON'T KNOW, SIR. WE SAW THE FLARES AND DOUBLE-TIMED IT OVER TO POST 18. THE WHOLE SHORE WAS BREAKING LOOSE. WE GRABBED PROFESSOR NESBITT JUST IN TIME. WE NEVER FOUND RITCHIE. COLONEL, WE'VE GOT TO GET NESBITT TO A HOSPITAL IN THE STATES. HE'S IN A BAD WAY. RIGHT. GET WORD TO THE MAIN BASE. WE WANT A PLANE RIGHT AWAY. RITCHIE... I'LL GET YOU OUT. I'LL GET YOU OUT. THE MONSTER... HURRY, IT'S COMING. WATCH OUT! THE MONSTER! THE MONSTER! WELL, PROFESSOR NESBITT, HOW DO YOU FEEL TODAY? FINE. WHERE'S COLONEL EVANS? DID YOU REACH COLONEL EVANS? HE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE NOW. I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET DR. INGERSOL. HE WANTS TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS, IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'LL BE TOO HARD ON YOU. QUESTIONS? I'M A PSYCHIATRIST, PROFESSOR NESBITT. I THOUGHT THAT TOGETHER WE MIGHT POSSIBLY GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. YOU'LL THINK I'M CRAZY, TOO. I KNOW MY STORY SOUNDS FANTASTIC, BUT... PROFESSOR NESBITT, THROUGHOUT HISTORY PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY'VE SEEN MONSTERS. OH, THERE WAS THE FAMOUS LOCH LOMOND MONSTER... YOU'LL PROBABLY RECALL... THEN THE GREEN SERPENTS OFF THE SHORES OF IRELAND. BUT AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER, NOT ONE OF THEM WAS EVER CAUGHT OR EVEN PHOTOGRAPHED. DOC, I'M NOT INCLINED TO LET MY IMAGINATION RUN AWAY WITH ME. I'M A SCIENTIST. ALL RIGHT. THEN AS A SCIENTIST, IT SHOULDN'T BE INCONCEIVABLE TO YOU THAT THE MIND CAN WITHSTAND JUST SO MUCH PRESSURE. THE SHOCK OF SEEING YOUR FRIEND DEAD, YOUR OWN TERRIFYING PREDICAMENT WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR, SO THAT YOU MOMENTARILY LOST CONTACT WITH REALITY. IT'S A PHENOMENON WHICH WAS... NOT UNCOMMON DURING THE WAR. BUT GEORGE RITCHIE WASN'T DEAD WHEN I TALKED TO HIM. HE TRIED TO WARN ME. 2 PEOPLE DON'T SHARE THE SAME HALLUCINATION. HELLO, TOM. HOW ARE YOU? THAWED OUT? JACK, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME TRYING TO CONVINCE THESE PEOPLE THAT I'M NOT AN IDIOT. I WAS IN WASHINGTON MAKING MY REPORT... WHAT'D THEY SAY ABOUT THE ANIMAL? I WANT TO BE IN ON ANY EXPEDITION GOING AFTER HIM. TOM, I DIDN'T TELL THEM ABOUT THE ANIMAL. WHY NOT? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE REPORT. I WENT BACK TO POST 18. I TRIED TO RECONSTRUCT WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE. I COULDN'T FIND A THING. NO TRACKS, NOTHING. NOTHING? I'M SORRY. I WISH I COULD SAY I SAW SOMETHING. THE BLIZZARD. THERE WAS A BLIZZARD, REMEMBER? THE SNOW MUST HAVE BLOWN OVER AND COVERED EVERYTHING. JACK, CHECK ME OUT OF HERE. YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION TO LEAVE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU HAVE REST. HOW CAN I REST? PROFESSOR NESBITT, I'VE ENCOUNTERED THIS SORT OF THING BEFORE. YOU'VE UNDERGONE A TREMENDOUS SHOCK. YOU'VE GOT TO STAY IN BED. I SEE. THAT MAKES IT OFFICIAL. I'M AFRAID IT DOES. SO LONG, TOM. YOU DO WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS. WE'LL GET TOGETHER AS SOON AS YOU'RE ON YOUR FEET AGAIN. THAT WON'T BE TOO LONG. WHAT ABOUT THAT SOUND I HEARD? IN YOUR CONDITION, IT COULD'VE BEEN ANYTHING... THE WIND... ANYTHING. NO WIND EVER MADE A SOUND LIKE THAT. CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN! ARE YOU DAFT, MAN? AAH! GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR TURBULENT WORLD TODAY? OH, DEATH AND POLITICS. THE COMIC PAGE IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE ANYMORE. I TAKE IT THEN THAT'S FOR PEACE OF MIND. YOU ADVISE A DOSE OF IT AFTER EACH MEAL. YOU QUOTE ME EXACTLY. I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR ADVICE EXACTLY. AHH, HERE IT IS. SAY... LOOK AT THIS. THAT ITEM IS RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS... ON THE COMIC PAGE. AND THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE, DR. ELSON. I FELT, IF YOU HEARD MY STORY, YOU'D DO SOMETHING. AND WHAT IS IT YOU THINK I CAN DO? FIT OUT AN EXPEDITION AND INSTITUTE A SEARCH. HEH. MY DEAR BOY, THE FITTING OUT OF AN EXPEDITION REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL SUCH AS TIMING, PERSONNEL, MONEY. HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT DETAILS IN THE FACE OF SUCH A DISCOVERY? I'M NOT IN THE FIELD OF PALEONTOLOGY, AND I HAVE A TREMENDOUS DESIRE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS ANIMAL. I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE SUCH A COMPELLING CURIOSITY THAT NOTHING WOULD STAND IN YOUR WAY. PROFESSOR NESBITT, AFTER WAITING FOR 30 YEARS, I'M ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE MY FIRST EXTENDED HOLIDAY, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I WOULD THROW ASIDE MY PLANS IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BEING POSSIBLE. IT ISN'T. WHAT ABOUT THAT NEWSPAPER ITEM? OH... IF ALL THE ITEMS OF SEAMEN REPORTING MONSTERS WERE PLACED END ON END, IT WOULD REACH TO THE MOON, MY BOY. YOU MEAN I'M JUST WASTING YOUR TIME? DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BELIEVE YOU SAW A CREATURE THAT WOULD BE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OLD? YOU SAID THAT A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO, THE WATER OF THE MESOZOIC AGE TURNED TO ICE. ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT AN ANIMAL COULD HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN THAT ICE, CAUGHT IN THE SUDDENLY FREEZING TEMPERATURES, AND LOCKED IN? THEN WHEN WE RELEASED THE BOMB, THE HEAT GENERATED MELTED THE ICE IN WHICH THIS BEAST WAS IMPRISONED AND FREED IT. BRINGING IT BACK TO LIFE AFTER A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS? COULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN IN A STATE OF HIBERNATION? AFTER ALL, BEARS LIVE THROUGH A WINTER UNDER SOMEWHAT SIMILAR CONDITIONS. THAT'S QUITE TRUE. A BEAR DOES LIVE OFF ITSELF FOR ONE WINTER... FROM FOOD ACCUMULATED WITHIN ITSELF, BUT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT AN ANIMAL COULD LIVE FOR A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OFF ITS OWN TISSUE. TO PUT IT MILDLY, HE'D REQUIRE QUITE AN APPETITE, DON'T YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL BE OF ANY HELP, BUT DO YOU REMEMBER, DOCTOR, A FEW YEARS AGO AN EXPEDITION UNEARTHED A HERD OF MASTODONS IN THE SIBERIAN TUNDRA DEAD THOUSANDS OF YEARS, YET THEIR FUR WAS STILL INTACT, THE MEAT STILL EDIBLE. YES, THAT'S QUITE RIGHT, MY DEAR LEE, BUT, UH, THEY WEREN'T ALIVE, AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. THEY WEREN'T ALIVE. NO. I'M SORRY, PROFESSOR, BUT, IN ALL HONESTY, I... I CAN'T SUPPORT YOUR STORY. WELL... I GUESS I'LL GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL. MAYBE I SHOULD ASK FOR A TRANSFER TO THE PSYCHOPATHIC WARD. OH, NONSENSE. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS ALL THAT, MY BOY. THANKS FOR LISTENING, DOCTOR. WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO THIS COUNTRY, I ATTENDED HIS LECTURES ON THE CURATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPE. HE'S A BRILLIANT MAN. ISN'T HIS STORY IN ANY WAY FEASIBLE? NO, AND I'M SORRY. I'D RATHER LIKE TO HELP HIM. QUITE FRANKLY, I THOUGHT THAT LITTLE JAUNT OF YOURS LAST WEEK WOULD KNOCK YOU FOR A LOOP, BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOU. I FEEL FINE. WHEN DO YOU THINK I CAN LEAVE? ANYTIME'S ALL RIGHT WITH US. DON'T GO RUSHING OFF TO THE NORTH POLE AGAIN. KEEP FIT AND WARM. TAKE THOSE VITAMINS THAT I GAVE YOU. Announcer: THIS IS YOUR HOUR OF MIRTH AND MELODY. THEY SAY MUSIC HATH CHARMS TO SOOTH THE SAVAGE BEAST. THEY OUGHT TO TRY IT ON THESE SEA MONSTERS WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT. FROM MARQUETTE, CANADA, TODAY COMES WORD OF A SECOND SHIP DESTROYED BY AN ENORMOUS BEAST, ACCORDING TO HER CAPTAIN, GEORGES LeMAY. HE REALLY OUGHT TO STOP SMOKING THAT STUFF AND TRY VIRGINIA GOLDS BECAUSE... WELL, IT SHOULDN'T TAKE ME TOO LONG TO CATCH UP. OH, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, PROFESSOR. THANK YOU. ANYTHING ELSE, MISS RYAN? OH, YES, UH, THERE'S MISS LEE HUNTER WAITING TO SEE YOU. MISS LEE HUNTER? MM-HMM. SHE'S VERY PRETTY. SEND HER IN. PROFESSOR NESBITT? HOW ARE YOU? FINE. FINE. WE MET AT THE UNIVERSITY. I'M DR. ELSON'S ASSISTANT. OH, YES, OF COURSE. THE VERDICT... A PREHISTORIC ANIMAL WOULD BE PRESUMPTUOUS TO BE ALIVE TODAY AND UPSET YOUR NEATLY CATALOGED THEORIES. I SEE YOU DON'T REMEMBER. I WAS A SYMPATHETIC BYSTANDER. OH, REALLY? HOW COME? I HAVE A DEEP, ABIDING FAITH IN THE WORK OF SCIENTISTS. OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE ONE MYSELF. HEH. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN? THANK YOU. SORRY I CAN'T OFFER YOU ANYTHING, BUT EVERYTHING WE HAVE AROUND HERE IS RADIOACTIVE. NO. THANK YOU, ANYWAY. WHEN I WAS IN THE LAB YESTERDAY, I HEARD A RADIO REPORT ABOUT A MAN WHO CLAIMED THAT HIS SHIP WAS SUNK BY A SEA MONSTER. BUT I THOUGHT IF ALL THE STORIES ABOUT SEA MONSTERS WERE LAID END TO END, THEY'D REACH THE MOON. BUT 2 REPORTS COMING SO CLOSE TOGETHER. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK 2 REPORTS ARE GOING TO CONVINCE ANYBODY ANY MORE THAN ONE DID? WELL, IT CONVINCED ME. AT LEAST IT GOT ME TO THINKING IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE INVESTIGATING THEM. I'VE GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE SKETCHES OF THE KNOWN PREHISTORIC ANIMALS. NOW, IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY THE... YOU KNOW, BEING CONSIDERED CRAZY HAS BEEN QUITE AN EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, I WOULDN'T CARE TO GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. IS THIS THE MAN WITH THE COMPELLING CURIOSITY? AFRAID OF RIDICULE? I'M NOT AFRAID OF RIDICULE. NO, BUT I'M AFRAID THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU SAID THERE'S SKETCHES OF ALL THE KNOWN ANIMALS? WHAT IF IT'S AN UNKNOWN ONE? THAT'S POSSIBLE, BUT WE'LL NEVER REALLY KNOW UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THEM. OH, PROFESSOR, THINK WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF YOU WERE RIGHT. 5-MINUTE BREAK. IT'S COFFEE TIME. GOOD. I NEED IT. CREAM AND SUGAR? YOU'D BETTER TAKE BOTH. I MAKE COFFEE STRONG ENOUGH TO ENTER THE OLYMPICS. ONE OR 2? 2, PLEASE. I NEVER KNEW THERE WERE SO MANY PREHISTORIC ANIMALS. WE HAVEN'T EVEN REACHED THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD YET. I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD IDENTIFY THAT BEAST NOW IF IT LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOW. MAYBE IT'S PART IMAGINATION AFTER ALL, SOMETHING I USED TO DREAM ABOUT WHEN I WAS A KID OR READ IN FAIRY TALES. YOU'RE TIRED. WHY DON'T YOU JUST RELAX FOR A MOMENT? HAVE A SANDWICH. THANKS. FUNNY. WHAT'S FUNNY? WELL, A GIRL LIKE YOU, A PALEONTOLOGIST. WHAT'S WRONG WITH PALEONTOLOGY? CLASSIFYING OLD BONES. OLD BONES? WHY, IF WE DIDN'T STUDY THE PAST, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ATOM. DR. ELSON SAYS THAT THE FUTURE IS THE REFLECTION OF THE PAST. YOU'RE FOND OF DR. ELSON, AREN'T YOU? MM-HMM. HOW DID YOU BECOME HIS ASSISTANT? I SUPPOSE BY CONTINUALLY ANTAGONIZING HIM. I WAS ONE OF HIS STUDENTS, AND, TO HEAR HIM TELL IT, ALL I DID WAS CHALLENGE HIM OR ARGUE WITH HIM. I WAS AFRAID HE WAS GOING TO EXPEL ME. INSTEAD, HE ASKED ME TO BE HIS ASSISTANT AFTER I GRADUATED. SO, I GRADUATED, AND HERE I AM. AND HERE I AM. BETWEEN US, WE SPAN THE AGES. YOU DEAL WITH THE PAST, I, WITH THE FUTURE. AND HOW UNCOMPLICATED THE PAST WAS. AND HOW BRIGHT THE FUTURE CAN BE. WELL, UH... LET'S GET BACK TO THE PRESENT. THIS MIGHT BE IT. I'M NOT SURE. NOT SURE? THE HEAD LOOKS SIMILAR, BUT THE FRONT LEGS ARE TOO SHORT. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. IS THIS ANY BETTER? NOW, THAT'S MUCH MORE LIKE IT. AND WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE? THAT'S THE CLOSEST. I THINK THAT IS IT. LEE, I THINK THAT'S THE ONE I SAW! IF 2 INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS SAW THE SAME THING... IF THAT CAPTAIN IN CANADA COULD IDENTIFY THE SAME SKETCH... AND TELL HIS STORY TO DR. ELSON. CAPTAIN GEORGES LeMAY, MARQUETTE, CANADA. OPERATOR. I WANT TO MAKE A LONG- DISTANCE CALL, PLEASE. PERSON-TO-PERSON TO... CAPTAIN GEORGES LeMAY. MARQUETTE, CANADA. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. CHARGE THIS CALL TO CIRCLE 4-4771. THANK YOU. IT'S MY MONSTER. ALLO. CAPITAINE, ON VOUS TELEPHONE DE NEW YORK. NEW YORK? ETES-VOUS PRET? JE SUIS TOUJOURS PRET, VOYONS. THEY'RE SPEAKING FRENCH. CAPITAINE LeMAY IS READY. THANK YOU. ALLO. HELLO. CAPTAIN LeMAY? OUI. OUI. MY NAME IS TOM NESBITT. I'M A SCIENTIST IN NEW YORK. I HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU. I DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. PARLEZ FRANCAIS, S'IL VOUS PLAIT. OUI, VOLONTIERS. JE M'APPELLE TOM NESBITT. JE SUIS UN PROFESSEUR A NEW YORK. JE VOUDRAIS M'INFORMER SUR LE SERPENT DE MER QUI A DETRUIT VOTRE BATEAU. MOI, J'AI VU LE MEME SERPENT. SERPENT? SERPENT? ZUT ALORS! CAPTAIN? HELLO? CAPTAIN LeMAY? I AM SORRY, BUT THE CAPITAINE HAS HUNG UP. HE'S VERY UNHAPPY WHEN ANYBODY MENTIONS HIS ACCIDENT BECAUSE EVERYONE LAUGHS AT HIM. OPERATOR, PLEASE GET THE CAPTAIN BACK. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. I AM SORRY, MONSIEUR. HE'LL NOT SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN, I'M SURE. HE'S A STUBBORN OLD MAN, PERHAPS A LITTLE CRAZY, ESPECIALLY ON THE SUBJECT OF SERPENTS. THEY THINK HE'S CRAZY, TOO. WELL, IT WAS A GOOD TRY ANYWAY. BUT GOOD TRYS DON'T PAY OFF. DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IF YOU WENT UP THERE, YOU COULD MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS? I COULD GET A PLANE. PHONE ME IF ANYTHING EXCITING HAPPENS. I'LL PHONE YOU EVEN IF NOTHING HAPPENS. YOU MISSED HIM BY NOT MORE THAN 2 HOURS, I'M SURE. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL ME WHERE HE WENT. HIS HOUSEKEEPER WOULDN'T GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION. CAPTAIN LeMAY'S BEEN VERY TOUCHY SINCE HIS SEA SERPENT INCIDENT. PEOPLE FELT THAT HE WAS A BIT BALMY, YOU KNOW. THEY LAUGHED AT HIM. TOO BAD, TOO. THE MAN HAS SERVED WELL AND FAITHFULLY FOR YEARS. I BELIEVE A MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO A FEW NIPS NOW AND THEN, I ALWAYS SAY. THEN, UH, YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIS STORY. I SAID HE WAS BALMY, NOT ME. HE LET IT GET OUT THAT HE WAS HEADED FOR THE INTERIOR OF CANADA, AND WAS NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL HE HIT A SPOT THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY UNINHABITED BY WHITE MEN. A BLOOMING HERMIT HE WANTS TO BE. MARK MY WORD, HE'LL BE BACK IN LESS THAN A MONTH. I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG. WERE THERE ANY OTHER SURVIVORS? NO. HOW FAR IS IT TO ST. PIERRE? OH, ABOUT 100 MILES. ARE YOU GOING DOWN TO SEE THIS OTHER CHAP WHO CLAIMS THAT HE SAW IT? YES. I SAY, YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS SEA SERPENT FABLE, DO YOU? WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, BALMY? GOOD EVENING, JACOB. YOU LOOK MUCH BETTER TODAY. A MAN IS HERE, A VERY GREAT SCIENTIST FROM NEW YORK. NO, SISTER. TAKE HIM AWAY. I WANT NO ONE NEAR ME. HE WENT TO SO MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND YOU. WHY? HE SAYS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT IS ABOUT, UH, THE BEAST YOU SAW. TELL HIM TO LEAVE ME ALONE! TELL HIM I SAW NOTHING! TELL HIM I KNOW NOTHING! TELL HIM IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD! THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS. EXCEPT ME, JACOB. WHO ARE YOU? I SAW THE BEAST, TOO. YOU SAW HIM? YOU'RE NOT PLAYING JOKES ON ME? NO, I'M NOT PLAYING ANY JOKES. PEOPLE CALLED ME CRAZY, TOO. IT STAYS IN MY MIND ALWAYS, AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. JACOB, IN NEW YORK THERE ARE SCIENTISTS, FRIENDS OF MINE, WHO WILL LISTEN AND BELIEVE. JACOB, WILL YOU COME TO NEW YORK WITH ME? IS HE WELL ENOUGH TO TRAVEL? I WILL ASK THE DOCTOR. YOU KNOW, LEE, THERE'S SOMETHING VERY COMPENSATING IN HAVING TO WAIT 30 YEARS FOR A HOLIDAY, BECAUSE WHEN IT FINALLY COMES THE JOY OF ANTICIPATION IS MULTIPLIED BY JUST THAT MANY YEARS. I FEEL RATHER LIKE A SCHOOLBOY ON THE VERGE OF DEPARTING FOR MY FIRST SUMMER CAMP. OH, BY THE WAY, THAT REMINDS ME, OUR YOUNG NUCLEAR PHYSICIST APPEARS TO BE DELAYED. HE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE HIM LONG FROM THE AIRPORT. MESOZOIC ANIMAL ALIVE TODAY. HO HO HO. I CAN LOSE MY JOB AND MY REPUTATION LISTENING TO SUCH NONSENSE. HOWEVER, I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW MY PERSONAL OPINION TO INTERFERE WITH A POSSIBLE ROMANCE. DON'T TRY TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT. YOU'RE JUST BEING STUBBORN. AM I? HMPH. WELL, JUST YOU LISTEN TO THIS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I READ THIS MORNING. "ON THE 21st OF OCTOBER, IN THE YEAR 1797, "ONE PROFESSOR GORDON LAUGHTON "WAS FORCIBLY REMOVED BY ORDER OF THE CROWN "FROM HIS CHAIR OF SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH. "DR. LAUGHTON WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED "THAT LEPRECHAUNS WERE RESPONSIBLE "FOR THE UPROOTING OF THE ANCIENT CAMPUS OAK, "EVEN SWEARING UPON OATH THAT HE HAD SEEN THEM REMOVE IT." SO, YOU SEE, TODAY IT'S MONSTERS INSTEAD OF LEPRECHAUNS. HOW CERTAIN ARE YOU THERE WERE NO LEPRECHAUNS? TOM! HELLO, LEE. I DON'T RECALL THIS DR. LAUGHTON, BUT WHAT ABOUT GALILEO? HE SAID THE EARTH WAS ROUND. THEY MADE HIM RECANT. HOWEVER, THE EARTH IS ROUND, AND THERE IS A MONSTER. AND I THINK I CAN CONVINCE YOU. IS THIS YOUR SAILOR WITNESS? YES, SIR. JACOB BOWMAN. HE WAS THE HELMSMAN ON THE FISHING BOAT FORTUNE. DR. ELSON, MISS HUNTER. SO, YOU SAW THE MONSTER, TOO, HMM? YES, SIR. HMM. WELL, GO AHEAD, MY DEAR. THIS IS YOUR EXPERIMENT. JACOB, I WANT YOU TO LOOK THROUGH THOSE SKETCHES AND PICK OUT THE ONE THAT YOU SAW. YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A WASTE OF TIME, HMM? DR. ELSON, SEVERAL DAYS AGO AT MISS HUNTER'S APARTMENT, I PICKED OUT THE SKETCH OF THE BEAST I SAW. IT'S RIGHT IN THAT BATCH. HMM. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN PALEONTOLOGY THE EMPIRICAL SYSTEM OF LOGIC ISN'T ENOUGH. IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF EMPIRICS. IF A PARTICLE OF THE SUN BROKE OFF AND FLEW INTO SPACE, I WOULDN'T CONSIDER THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THAT NEWS TO BE INSANE. AS A SCIENTIST, I WOULD EXAMINE EVERY FACET OF IT. YES, MY BOY, BUT IF A PARTICLE OF THE SUN WERE TO BREAK OFF, A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT. IF IT BROKE OFF, IT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IF ONE SAW IT OR NO ONE AT ALL. IT WOULD STILL BE. THE SAME WITH THE MONSTER. IT STILL IS. HMM. WELL, PERHAPS I'M GETTING OLD. NOW, JACOB, YOU MUST BE QUITE SURE ABOUT THIS CREATURE YOU CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN. THERE MUST BE NO DOUBT IN YOUR MIND. IF IT'S HERE, I'LL KNOW IT. THAT. THAT'S THE ONE I PICKED. IT'S THE RHEDOSAURUS, EXTINCT FOR A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS. A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS? YES... AND THE DIRECT ANCESTOR OF THAT LITTLE LADY THERE, ONLY TWICE THE SIZE ACCORDING TO THEORY. THE ONLY KNOWN FOSSILS OF ITS SPECIES EVER DISCOVERED WERE FOUND IN A DRAG OF THE HUDSON SUBMARINE CANYONS, 150 MILES FROM NEW YORK. DIDN'T PROFESSOR EDMONDS WRITE A PAPER ON THAT JUST LAST YEAR? YES. YES. IF WE COULD ONLY BE SURE, WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. DR. ELSON, WHAT FURTHER PROOF DO YOU NEED? THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND THEY'LL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. I TRIED TO GET THE AUTHORITIES TO KEEP THE SEA LANES AND THE COASTLINE UNDER CLOSE WATCH. THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME. WELL, THEY'LL LISTEN TO YOU THIS TIME, MY BOY. GET THEM ON THE PHONE. I'LL TALK TO THEM. THANKS. COLONEL EVANS, PLEASE. JACK? TOM NESBITT. I FEEL GREAT. THAT HALLUCINATION OF MINE... THE ONE THAT EVERYBODY WAS HAVING SUCH A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT... WELL, I'VE GOT PROOF THE MONSTER EXISTS. NOW, TOM, LET'S NOT START THAT AGAIN. WHAT? OH, I CAN JUST SEE MYSELF GOING TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND REQUESTING PERMISSION TO SEEK OUT A PREHISTORIC MONSTER. EAGLES ON A STRAIT JACKET ARE NOT REGULATION UNIFORM. LOOK, JACK, I'M HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY. I'M WITH DR. ELSON, THE FOREMOST PALEONTOLOGIST IN THE WORLD. JUST A MOMENT. HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. COLONEL EVANS, THIS IS DR. ELSON. COLONEL, I'M CONVINCED THAT PROFESSOR NESBITT IS ON TO SOMETHING. DR. ELSON, THERE HAVE BEEN ALL KINDS OF STORIES... STORIES OF SEA SERPENTS, STORIES OF THE WORLD COMING TO AN END, FLYING SAUCERS... AND WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THERE ARE NO FLYING SAUCERS? BUT NEVERTHELESS, I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT BY SOME STRANGE TRICK OF CHANCE THIS CREATURE DOES EXIST, AND I'M PREPARED TO STAKE MY REPUTATION ON IT. WELL, I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, DOCTOR, BUT I THINK WE'LL JUST LOOK FOOLISH IF WE STICK OUR NECK OUT. WELL, WILL YOU PROMISE ME, IF ANY FURTHER REPORTS COME IN, YOU'LL LET US KNOW? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO, DOCTOR. I'VE GOT A FRIEND IN THE COAST GUARD. I'LL DROP IN TO SEE HIM. IF HE'S HEARD OF ANYTHING, I'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU. OK? THANK YOU, COLONEL. WE'LL APPRECIATE IT. HE'S GOING TO CHECK AND LET US KNOW. WE CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND. I'M AFRAID THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO... BUT WAIT. I HEARD A NEW SONG AT THE TAVERN THE OTHER DAY. SOMETHING ABOUT GIN AND WILD WOMEN. OH, HOW DID IT GO? OH, I DON'T REMEMBER. I STUCK 5 NICKELS IN THE BOX TO HEAR IT AGAIN, AND THE THING BUSTED DOWN. WELL, YOU KNOW ME. I COULDN'T CARRY A TUNE IN A BUSHEL BASKET. I LIKE THE BALLADS. THE OLD ONES THAT WARM YOU EVEN WHEN THE FOG IS A FOOT THICK. DID YOU HEAR THAT? COME IN. THAT'S ALL. JACK, HOW ARE YOU? PHIL, AT THIS MOMENT, I DON'T KNOW. WELL, SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE THE LAST ARMY-NAVY GAME. HA HA HA. WHAT A GAME THAT WAS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? A.E.C. GETTING YOU DOWN? NO, NOT AT ALL, PHIL. GOOD. STICK AROUND. I'LL BE THROUGH HERE IN A MINUTE AND WE'LL GO OVER TO THE CLUB. PHIL, HERE IT IS STRAIGHT. ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS IN THE LAST POLAR TEST CLAIMS HE SAW A MONSTER. NOW, DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. THE DEAN AT THE COLLEGE OF NATURAL HISTORY BELIEVES IT. THEN WHO AM I TO DOUBT IT? SAY, YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO GET A SECTION 8 DISCHARGE, ARE YOU? THESE SCIENTISTS CLAIM THAT THIS MONSTER, BEAST, WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S A PREHISTORIC THING... AND IF YOU LAUGH, I'LL BRAIN YOU... IS ROMPING AROUND THE NORTH ATLANTIC. HA HA HA. I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO BRAIN ME. YOU'RE NUTS, JACK. ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. LOOK, PHIL, WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR? CHECK AROUND AND SEE IF THERE'S BEEN ANY REPORTS OF ANY FREAK HAPPENINGS OR ANYTHING UNUSUAL. ARE YOU ON THE LEVEL? WELL, IF STANDING ON MY HEAD IS ON THE LEVEL, I AM. YOU CERTAINLY SOUND SERIOUS. ALL RIGHT. I'LL CHECK. BUT SO HELP ME, IF THIS IS A PRACTICAL JOKE... YEAH. I'LL DIE LAUGHING. WELL, THAT'S IT. NO STORM, NO EARTHQUAKE, NOTHING, BUT THAT LIGHTHOUSE WAS DESTROYED COMPLETELY. WERE THERE ANY OTHER UNEXPLAINED HAPPENINGS? YES. COAST GUARD STATION 37 REPORTED MINOR SHORE WRECKAGE ALONG THE MASSACHUSETTS COAST. SEVERAL ISOLATED BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED, AND A FARMER WAS FOUND CRUSHED TO DEATH. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CERTAIN INEXORABLE CHRONOLOGY IN THESE DISASTERS. I DON'T FOLLOW YOU, DOCTOR. WELL, TOM FIRST SAW THE RHEDOSAURUS NEAR BAFFIN BAY, WHILE HIS LATEST PRESUMED PRESENCE IS OFF THE COAST OF MASSACHUSETTS. MAY I HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR CHART, CAPTAIN? OF COURSE. OH, UH... NOW, AHEM, FIRST, NORTH OF BAFFIN BAY. AND SECOND, THE FISHING KETCH FORTUNE WAS WRECKED HERE, OFF THE GRAND BANKS. AND ANOTHER ONE ATTACKED SHORTLY THEREAFTER... UH, HERE. NOVA SCOTIA. AND THIRD, THE LIGHTHOUSE OFF THE COAST OF MAINE. UH, AND FOURTH, THE UNEXPLAINED WRECKAGE OFF THE COAST OF MASSACHUSETTS. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE ARCTIC CURRENT ALL THE WAY DOWN. SO, IT'S JUST POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT BE MAKING FOR... HERE. IT WAS IN THESE SUBMERGED CANYONS THAT THE ONLY KNOWN FOSSILS OF HIS SPECIES WERE FOUND. IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE, WE COULD MINE THOSE CANYONS. AND KILL THE RHEDOSAURUS? OH, NO. THINK OF WHAT A LOSS TO SCIENCE THAT WOULD BE. OH, NO. BUT TO CAPTURE IT ALIVE, THAT WOULD BE AN ACHIEVEMENT. AND JUST HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO CAPTURE IT, IF IT EXISTS? I... I DON'T KNOW, BUT, UH, IF WE ASCERTAIN IT'S DOWN THERE IN THE CANYONS, I SHALL HAVE TO GO DOWN AND SEE IT BEFORE I DECIDE UPON A METHOD OF CAPTURE. OH, BUT THAT'S MUCH TOO DANGEROUS. YES, BUT THEN THE RISK WOULD BE WORTH IT WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE BENEFIT TO SCIENCE. CAPTAIN, IS IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN THE USE OF A DIVING BELL? YOU MEAN YOU REALLY WANT TO GO DOWN THERE? YES. I CAN GET A DIVING BELL... WHAT DO YOU THINK, JACK? EVERYTHING ELSE THEY SAY CHECKS OUT. IF YOU CAN GET IT, LET'S MOVE. THANK YOU. UH, AHEM... I STILL DON'T SEE HOW HE'S GONNA FIND IT. THIS CANYON IS A HUNDRED MILES LONG. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, HE PLANS TO DROP DOWN AT A DIFFERENT SPOT EVERY HOUR UNTIL HE DOES FIND IT. HEAR THIS. HEAR THIS. WE ARE NOW READY TO MAKE THE DIVE AT POSITION NUMBER ONE. I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF YOU GOING DOWN THERE WITH JUST ONE MAN. BUT THAT'S CAPACITY. BESIDES, IF THERE'S ANY DANGER, MY CREWMAN, MR. WILSON, WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO. I BROUGHT YOUR DRAMAMINE. NO, THANK YOU, MY DEAR. I'LL BE MUCH TOO EXCITED TO GET SEASICK. Man: ARE YOU READY, DR. ELSON? REMEMBER, AT THE FIRST SIGN OF DANGER, SIGNAL US. WHY WILL YOU PERSIST IN TALKING ABOUT DANGER, MY BOY? THE RHEDOSAURUS AND I ARE OLD FRIENDS. GOOD LUCK, DOCTOR. THANK YOU, MY BOY. HERE YOU ARE, SIR. THANK YOU. NOW, DON'T LOOK SO WORRIED, LEE. WE'RE SCIENTISTS. THIS IS OUR JOB. THIS IS A GREAT MOMENT FOR ME. EVERYTHING SHIPSHAPE IN THERE? SPLENDID, THANK YOU. ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME. LOWER AWAY. HOIST AWAY. IS THERE ANYTHING I HAVE TO DO? OH, NO, SIR. YOU JUST RELAX AND ENJOY THE SCENERY. OH, BOY. THIS IS SUCH A STRANGE FEELING. I FEEL I'M LEAVING A WORLD OF UNTOLD TOMORROWS FOR A WORLD OF COUNTLESS YESTERDAYS. YOU KNOW, LEE WAS RIGHT. I... I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE DRAMAMINE PILLS. THIS IS ALL VERY FRUSTRATING. I DO HOPE ALL OUR ENDEAVORS ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN VAIN. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME, DOCTOR. WE'RE HAVING COFFEE NOW. AND SOME VISITORS. THERE APPEARS TO BE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN 2 OF THE LOCAL INHABITANTS. THERE HE IS! IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S TREMENDOUS! I CAN ONLY SEE PART OF HIM... THE LEG... AND THE SHOULDER... BUT HE'S ENORMOUS! HE FOUND IT! SHALL I PULL YOU UP? NO, NO, NO! PUT LEE ON! PUT LEE ON! HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. YES, DOCTOR? LEE, THERE'S NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. IT'S A PALEOLITHIC SURVIVAL... EXACTLY AS WE PICTURED IT, EXCEPT THAT THE DORSAL IS SINGULAR, NOT BILATERAL. AND THE CLAVICLE SUSPENSION APPEARS TO BE... CANTILEVERIC! BUT THE MOST ASTONISHING THING ABOUT IT IS THAT... DOCTOR. DR. ELSON. HE DOESN'T ANSWER. HELLO. DR. ELSON. DR. ELSON. HELLO. GET HIM UP! RAISE THE BELL! WE'RE PULLING YOU UP. DR. ELSON. HELLO? DR. ELSON! CAN YOU HEAR ME? ANSWER ME! HELLO! THE LINE IS DEAD. WELL, THE REPORT'S BEEN TURNED IN. THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN ALERTED. THE COAST GUARD, TOO. EVANS HAS BEEN PUT IN CHARGE. THIS WAS BEING PACKED FOR A VERY DIFFERENT REASON. LEE, WHAT CAN I SAY? I SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN INSTEAD OF HIM. I'M TO BLAME. NOBODY'S TO BLAME... AND EVERYBODY'S TO BLAME. WE ALL DID WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT. BUT THAT DOESN'T BRING HIM THROUGH THE DOOR AGAIN... WITH HIS FUNNY LITTLE WALK AND THAT WONDERFUL SMILE. NOW THIS PLACE SEEMS SO EMPTY. HE USED TO PUTTER AROUND WITH THE SPECIMENS AND CALL THEM PET NAMES. HIS... HIS DEATH WAS SO FUTILE. LEE... HE WENT DOWN IN THAT BELL BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF HIS JOB. HE USED THE SAME WORDS JUST BEFORE... OH, TOM. BEATRICE! AAH! AAH! AAH! IT'S COMING UP NASSAU STREET TOWARD PINE. GET SOME HELP FAST. AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! EMERGENCY CALL. CIVILIAN DEFENSE EMERGENCY, REPORT TO DUTY. EMERGENCY CALL... NEW YORK IS LIKE A CITY BESIEGED. A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN DECLARED, AND THE ENTIRE POLICE FORCE PUT ON 24-HOUR DUTY. CIVILIAN DEFENSE IS FULLY MOBILIZED. AND SHELTERS HAVE BEEN OPENED IN AN EFFORT TO STOP THE MOUNTING HYSTERIA. ALL TRAFFIC HAS BEEN HALTED, AND TIMES SQUARE, THE HEART OF NEW YORK, HAS STOPPED BEATING. THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN CALLED OUT FULLY ARMED TO REPEL THE INVADER. THIS IS FULL-SCALE WAR AGAINST A TERRIBLE ENEMY SUCH AS MODERN MAN HAS NEVER BEFORE FACED. ORDINARY BULLETS HAVE NO EFFECT, AND A METHOD OF DESTROYING THE AWESOME CREATURE HAS NOT YET BEEN FORMULATED. BUT THE BATTLEFIELD HAS BEEN CLEARED... HERALD SQUARE, 34th STREET, BROADWAY... EVERY SECTION OF THE CITY IS GUARDED. NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE MONSTER WILL STRIKE NEXT. IT WAS LAST SEEN ON WALL STREET CLOSE TO WHERE IT CAME ASHORE. BUT LOWER MANHATTAN HAS BECOME NO MAN'S LAND WHERE THE BEAST AT PRESENT LIES HIDDEN. THE NATIONAL GUARD IS BARRICADING THE ENTIRE AREA IN AN EFFORT TO CONFINE THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF WHAT IS ALREADY THE WORST DISASTER IN NEW YORK'S HISTORY. PUT A SCREEN HERE. 105 TEMPERATURE. HERE'S THE BLOOD SPECIMEN. GET IT TO THE LABORATORY QUICKLY. I'M AFRAID, SAM. I AM AFRAID OF WHAT THAT CREATURE'S BROUGHT TO US. DEADLY AFRAID. COULD YOU PLACE IT BETWEEN HIS EYES? WE CAN TRY, SIR. FIRE WHEN READY, CORPORAL. YES, SIR. HIS SKULL... IT'S AT LEAST 8 INCHES THICK. ANOTHER ONE, COLONEL? NO. IT'D TAKE 3-INCH SHELL TO PENETRATE THAT SKULL. BAZOOKA SQUAD, PREPARE TO FIRE. THE HIGH VOLTAGE WIRES... IT'S GOING TO TOUCH THEM! BAZOOKA MEN, FIRE! UNDER THE NECK WHEN HE RAISES HIS HEAD AGAIN! GET THOSE EMERGENCY SEARCHLIGHTS ON! Man: WE'RE WORKING ON IT. SERGEANT. SERGEANT! WHAT IS IT? BLOOD. GIVE ME THE WALKIE-TALKIE. COLONEL EVANS? COLONEL EVANS! SERGEANT WITTONI. NOW LOOK, PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION. WOUNDED, THE ANIMAL MIGHT BE TWICE AS DANGEROUS AS BEFORE. IT'S A POSSIBILITY THE ANIMAL MIGHT HAVE HEADED FOR THE RIVER. WE'LL HAVE SHORE BATTERIES ALERTED AND NAVAL PATROL VESSELS. GET ME A COMMAND CAR. COLONEL EVANS SPEAKING. GO AHEAD. LOOK, COLONEL, SOMETHING'S FUNNY. MOST OF THE DETAIL, THEY'RE... WELL, THEY'RE OUT. OUT ON THEIR FEET, SIR. HAVE YOUR SERGEANT CONTACT THE MEDICS AND REPORT TO CAPTAIN MITCHELL. YOUR CAR IS READY, SIR. HAVE THE MEDICAL OFFICER REPORT TO ME AT AREA COMMAND. YES, SIR. HE IS REPORTED SOMEWHERE IN THE LOWER BAY AREA. BATTERY A IN POSITION ZERO. BATTERY A INTO POSITION ZERO. REPORT RADAR FINDINGS. REPORT RADAR FINDINGS. SOUNDING HARBOR BOTTOM. SOUNDING HARBOR BOTTOM. ACTIVATE MINES, NUMBERS 8 TO 24. ACTIVATE MINES, NUMBERS 8 TO 24. WHAT'S THE SITUATION, MAJOR? WE'RE SOUNDING THE HARBOR BOTTOM. NO INDICATION AS YET, SIR. CHARTING ROOM. COLONEL EVANS? MAJOR, THERE'S A CALL HERE FOR COLONEL EVANS. THIS IS EVANS SPEAKING. WHO? OH, YES. HELLO, DOCTOR. THEY'VE ALREADY BROUGHT IN OVER 50 0F YOUR MEN AND THE PEOPLE THIS AFTERNOON. THE MONSTER'S A GIANT GERM CARRIER OF A HORRIBLE VIRULENT DISEASE. CONTACT WITH THE ANIMAL'S BLOOD CAN BE FATAL. IF YOU USE SHELL FIRE, WHO KNOWS HOW FAR THE AIR WILL SPREAD THE PARTICLES OF IT. THE ENTIRE CITY CAN BE ENDANGERED. RIGHT, DOCTOR. HAVE THE ANTISUBMARINE NETS BEEN RAISED ACROSS THE NARROWS? NO, SIR. ORDER THEM RAISED. RAISE THE ANTISUBMARINE NETS. RAISE THE ANTISUBMARINE NETS. WE SHOULD'VE USED FLAMETHROWERS, WOULD'VE CREMATED THE BEAST AND PLAGUE WITH IT. FLAMETHROWERS? THE SMOKE WOULD'VE CARRIED THE BLOOD PARTICLES JUST AS FAR AS THE AIR. NO. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REDUCED SO THAT NOT EVEN A CINDER WOULD REMAIN. ANY REPORTS YET, MAJOR? NO SIGN AS YET, COLONEL. HE MAY BE DYING AT THE BOTTOM. WE'LL SET THE DRAGS IN THE MORNING. RIGHT. Man: ATTENTION! MONSTER ASHORE AT MANHATTAN BEACH. HEADING TOWARDS AMUSEMENT AREA. ON LAND? I THOUGHT WE HAD HIM IN A CORNER POCKET. JACK, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO BEAT HIM. HOW? RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPE. SHOOT IT INTO HIM AND DESTROY ALL THAT DISEASED TISSUE. KEEP YOUR MEN ALERTED, SERGEANT, BUT NOBODY'S TO FIRE UNLESS SPECIFICALLY ORDERED TO. YES, SIR. HOW SOON, TOM? SHOULD BE ANY MINUTE NOW. WAIT FOR US HERE. I'M PROFESSOR NESBITT. WE'VE GOT YOUR BABY, PROFESSOR. GOOD. WE NEED YOUR BEST MARKSMAN, JACK. RIGHT. HAVE HIM GET INTO THESE. HERE'S YOUR MAN, TOM. COLONEL SAYS YOU NEED A DEAD SHOT. YES. EVER USE A GRENADE RIFLE? PICK MY TEETH WITH 'EM. GOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT A RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPE IS? NO, BUT IF IT CAN BE LOADED, I CAN FIRE IT. I'LL LOAD IT. JUST REMEMBER ONE THING. IT HAS TO BE SHOT INTO THE WOUND, AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS THE ONLY ISOTOPE OF ITS KIND WE HAVE, SO YOU CAN'T MISS. LET'S GET TO THE TARGET. I CAN'T HIT HIM FROM HERE, MISTER. EVER RIDE ONE OF THOSE THINGS? YES, SIR. JACK, GET SOMEBODY OVER HERE WHO CAN OPERATE THAT ROLLER COASTER. WE WANT TO GET TO THE TOP IN ONE OF THOSE CARS. RIGHT! PUT YOUR HOOD ON. YES, SIR.
