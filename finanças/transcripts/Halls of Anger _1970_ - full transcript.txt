Jenny! Jenny! Jenny: Alan! Hi, how are you? Okay. How are you? Fine. What did you do this summer? Jenny: Oh, visited my grandparents in Woodstock, and went to that festival. It was really great! How about you? Alan? Hi, Mr. Davis. Hello, Jenny. I'm in your class again, Mr. Davis. Wasn't once enough? Mr. Davis! Yeah? Principal would like to see you. Oh, thank you, Jenny. Sorry, fellas, got to go. Oh, come on, Mr. Davis. Maybe tomorrow. Saved by the bell. Oh, Mr. Davis. Thank you for coming. From the board of education, Mr. Cargyll. Hi. Hi, glad to see you. And Mr. Willis. How are you? I'm well. Let's see, now, must be eight or nine years since I saw you. The all-pro game when I was in New York. Sit down, gentlemen. Tell me, Mr. Davis. Do you know Lafayette high school? Downtown? Yeah. Cargyll: It's a fine physical plant. And the board thinks you'd be very good there. But I have sort of settled in here. I know it's rewarding here. But it can be rewarding there, too. If we promoted you, to say, vice-principal? But I like teaching. You could still have a couple of english classes. Mr. Cargyll, may I ask you a question? Why are you being so good to me? Well, to be frank with you, we have a situation down at Lafayette. They have reapportioned the district and they transferred 200 white students in there. First time in five years. Two hundred white kids and 3,000 black, eh? You're already a day late in opening. Gentlemen, I can't say I don't know what you're talking about. But it seems to me that what you need is a professional disciplinarian. Not an english teacher. I think I better pass. Mr. Margolin, I understand you have a new science lab. I'd like to see it. Yes, yes, of course. Excuse us, gentlemen. Quincy, you don't want to go back there, do you? Why? I already told you why. I wonder if there isn't another reason. I don't have to give you all my reasons. Sure, you don't. Especially the real one. All right. I don't wanna go back to the ghetto. It took me 20 years to claw my way out of there. So, what do I wanna go back for? We need you down there. They need me here. These kids never see a black face. Do you? Hell! White man makes it, nobody comes running asking him to go back. White man goes, he's gone! You are not a white man. So? How far would you like to make it? Principal? Big wheel downtown? Maybe. You buck the board of education now, and you'll never get anywhere. They'll freeze you in your tracks. Like I said, they need you down there. Not here. * do you hear it? * can't you hear it? * reachin' out to you * trying to touch your hand * asking you to understand * do you see it? * see it * can't you see it? * see it * reachin' out to you * trying to show your eyes * trying to make you realize * rising * like a muddy river * falling * falling like the evening sun * don't you hear me crying? * crying out to every brother * telling it to everyone * telling it to everyone * telling it to everyone * do you feel it? * feel it * can't you feel it? * feel it * can't you feel it in your heart? * asking for love to start * reachin' out to you * reachin' out to you * do you hear it? * you can hear it in your head * do you see it? * you can see it with your eyes * can't you feel it? * you can feel it with your heart * all around you * asking for love to start * reachin' out to you * oh, yeah, yeah * reachin' out * reachin' out to you * oh, yeah, yeah, yeah * reachin' out to you * oh, listen to me, yeah, yeah * reachin' out to you * reachin' out to you Hey, save it. All right. Who's that? Say, man. Ain't you Quincy Davis? Yeah. What you doing down here? Teaching. You kidding. I'm not kidding. Hey, man, you know who that is? That's Quincy Davis. Dunk one, quince. Quincy: I haven't known to miss. Whoo! Vanilla ice cream. And I'm gonna take me a big lick! Anyone of them niggers give me any crap, I'll lay 'em out. You do that, leaky. Yes, sir, white folks. This is the plantation sure enough. But miss Scarlett, she ain't up yet. Now, look who's here. They done sent us our token white. Honkies with their wrinkly white asses. I thought there'd be 200. Where's the rest of them? Here's the rest of them. How did they get out? How? Some move, some went to private school. Some kids suddenly came down with heart trouble and can't travel. Would you believe, 27 requests for classical Greek? Ah, these will get washed up on the shore. I suppose their parents couldn't find the escape hatch. Maybe some of them didn't want to. They were those who were trying, but in the last couple of years, everything's become so complicated down here. That's why I asked for... For someone like you. I know you didn't like it. I'm adjusting. I knew you would. And frankly, I'm sure it is going to be a learning experience for both of us. However, in order to teach we have to stabilize things. Stabilize? Well, as vice-principal, your main job is to prevent trouble. Keep the lid on it. After all, we don't want the stew boiling all over the stove. Well, doesn't that more likely to increase pressure? I mean, maybe there are other ways. Look, Mr. Davis, let's be practical. We have a school to run. I think it's best if we let the rules guide us. But we also have to teach. Of course. And in order to teach, we have to prevent trouble. Let that be understood, Mr. Davis. Well, I understand. It's your school. I don't think, I'm gonna like it here. Hey, what do you know? A, a, b. A, b, a. All a's and b's. Doug, baby, you must have kissed a lot of behinds. You got a big mouth, don't you, leak? I never got an a or b in my whole life. Beautiful, beautiful. I don't think I'm gonna like it here. Look, why don't you wait and see, huh? Hey, don't tell me you wanna be here? Look, I'm not knocked out about it, but I'm gonna make the best of it. Look, no diploma, no college. I'm not gonna be punching machine like my old man all my life. How come you couldn't get out? Well, my parents tried, but there were too many Caucasian transfers already. The board of education put the brakes on it. Yeah, well, we're all in that bag. Stuck. Uh-uh, no, no, no. What do you mean? This here fountain's for blacks only. Yours is in the back. Keep your eye on that one. J.t. Watson. He's no good. Well, I wanna thank you all for letting me take a part of your lunch hour. Sure, I haven't covered everything. Whatever I've left out was no accident. I don't know anything about it. Anyway, we'll be going over all this again in greater detail before I start giving you orders. Thank you very much. I'm Rita monahan. History. Good to have you with us. Thank you. We need dedicated black men like you down here. It's very important. Mmm-hmm. Tell me, how are the kids taking to history? Not bad. As long as you don't... Oh, how shall I put it? Make excessive demands on them. They really make no demands, just stretching their muscles. That's very good. But before the negro can enter the mainstream and gain upward mobility, he must have... Tell him how sympathetic you are to the black problem later, Rita. Excuse me. Ivan Fowler. Civics. Hello, Fowler, how are things going? Well, it's always been tough to teach at Lafayette. Now, with the white kids. Yeah. Frankly, I'm afraid the place is gonna explode. Hey, nothing's gonna explode, Fowler. Harry greco. Hello. What department? Well, you might say I teach conduct. I'm the security guard here. Ernie: Hey, Harry. Better be careful how you handle that thing. You might shoot your pecker off. Oh... now you're a real riot, McKay. Or shouldn't I say "riot"? Excuse me. Sure. Ernie McKay, head jockstrap. I could tell. Listen, don't let them rattle you. There's a lot of potential down here. A lot of talent. The things is, you gotta find a way to deal with it, to channel it. Must be frustrating. Oh, stick around, you'll find out. Hi, there! Now, here's a man with real potential. Selling real estate. Right, Phil? Phil Stuart. Algebra. Look, I gotta do something to earn money? Yeah, sure. Come on, I'll introduce you to a teacher. Mr. Davis, miss Nash. Hello. Hello. Excuse me. See you around. Right. Nash? Lorraine Nash? Mmm-hmm. I hear it's easier to get into fort Knox than dealing this class. Oh! I can see why. What did you say your name was again? I can't remember. Coffee? Thank you. Well, welcome to Lafayette. We can sure use the help. Where's it most needed? You're looking at it. Well, I'll do whatever I can. No, no. You see, we only handle situations now, we don't settle them. So, when this year is over, I leave. You're not gonna go and leave me here all by myself, right? I know that hasn't happened to you much, but you'll live with it. Okay, turn 'em off. Turn 'em off. Sit anywhere for now. I'll assign seats later. Wait a minute. I don't wanna sit next to him. This cat smells like tuna fish. Lerone: Hey! Get off my chair! This is my chair! Sabin: Your momma smells like tuna fish. Students: Oh! And that's my name. We know who you is, man! You're the quince. Don't call out. My name is Mr. Davis. And I'll be teaching you english 11b. Nineteenth century, American literature. Oh, darling, oh! Come on, settle down, settle down. Yeah, you two. Now, the curriculum, calls for us to start with the early poets. Men like William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Waldo! Quincy: John Greenleaf whittier. And James Russell lowell. Aw, shit! Them old mothers again? I know they're not on your top 40. Now, most of these men, like, James Russell lowell, though they lived over 100 years ago... Say, what do you think that James Russell whatever cat would have done under the boards against bill Russell. Hey, man. What's the most you ever scored in a game, man? Hey, didn't you play in the Olympics? Come on now, not now. Knock it off! All right. Knock it off. If you want, we'll talk basketball later, all right? Now, we're talking books. I bet you were better than any white cat in the game. Weren't you? I didn't think so against Jerry west. Okay, back to work. Now, like everybody else, these writers had their own special bag. Quincy: Some of them were called transcendentalist. Be back in a second. Hey, man. Let me sit next to the brother here. What? Sit next to the brother. Dig? Yeah, sure. There you go, man. I wanna sit next to the brother. Why are you standing up? Why don't you take a seat? I forgot where it was. And I thought all you honkies are supposed to be so smart. Knock it off, j.T. You're not taking the honky's side against us, are you? Next thing, you'll be calling me a white racist. Okay, back to work. The book we'll be reading is the house of the seven gables by Nathaniel hawthorne. Are you Mr. Davis? Yes. Police. You know him? No. But I'm new here. Excuse me. Miss Nash, do you know this young man? Well, I'm not sure. He looks familiar. We thought he might've gone to school here. Who's it? We don't know. He looks about 16, so we figured he'd be... Wait a minute! Ellis. Deroy Ellis. Lorraine: He was in my home class, but he dropped out last year. What's wrong with him? He's dead. Burglary. They had to shoot him. Lorraine: Oh, no! Nothing they could do. He had a gun. But he was a baby! He had a gun. We'll look him up. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. God, if I don't get out of here. Look, I... I know how you feel. No, you don't. You know, I'm still hungry. Damn! Hey, hey, Carter! Carter! Shane was trying to score with your chick, man. Hey, j.T., what's happening, man? Martin! What's happening, man? Nothing much. Do you like it here, man? Yeah, yeah. It's okay. Listen, do me a favor, will you? Sharpen this for me. Sure, j. T. Hey! Hey, Martin! Do you mind? Thanks, man. So, coach knackers comes storming out of the door and he raises his leg... Screaming and shouting. It splits right down the middle. It wouldn't be so bad, but he had on flowered shorts. Pink flowered shorts. Okay, settle down. Quincy: Okay, okay. Let's settle down. First page, house of the seven gables. First row, first seat, Fairchild. "Halfway down a by-street "of one of our new england towns stands "A roust...Rusty, rusty wooden house "with seven... "Accurate, accurate..." "Acutely." Oh, "acutely," yeah. "...acutely peaked gables, "facing towards..." Thank you, Fairchild. You'll have to work on it. Next. "...various "points of the "com-pass. "The street is "Pynch..." "Pyncheon." "Pyncheon street. "The house is the old "pyncheon house." All right, Mae, thank you. Johnson. So far this is one hell of a story. Johnson. "The... "A... the ass." That's what it says. "The aspect." "The aspect of the... "Nebanale...nevanable." "Venerable." That's what that was? I know that word. "...venerable mansion has always... "Aff-lected "Affected?" "...me like a human..." Did you prepare this last night? I did. Hmm. I'm playing, for real. All right. Next. "...bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and sunshine, "but expressive also, of the long lapse of mortal life, "and accompanying vicissitudes that have passed within. "Were these to be worthily recounted, "they would form a narrative of no small interest and instruction, "possessing, moreover, a certain remarkable unity, "which might also seem the result of artistic arrangement. "But the story would include a chain of events "extending over the better part of two centuries, "and, written out with reasonable amplitude..." All right. Thank you. That's enough. Say, man. Say... You a surfer? A what? A surfer? Uh, no. I thought all you white boys were surfers. You know what they call this table? What? Rhodesia. That's funny. Well, I have been trying to laugh about it. Hey, you got your congas, man? Yeah. Hey, you too? What you got on your mind? Nothing big. We just going to blow black on some folks. Right on. I told you I didn't want trouble here. Quincy: I know what you told me, Mr. Wilkerson. There's only one thing to do, get rid of that j.T. Watson. Now, look, I don't like this kind of thing any more than you do... By tomorrow we probably will have a dozen white parents down here, yanking their kids out of school. Do you want us to lose our federal money? But nobody... We've got to get rid of trouble makers. No one was hurt. Now, you throw Watson out, you throw him on the garbage heap. Mr. Davis, we can't worry about every kid who refuses to fit in. But we'll only be passing the problem onto the streets. There's got to be a way to reach these kids. No one can. Then what are we here for? That's not what I meant. I mean... There are some kids who just can't be reached. Then will you let me try and do something with this one? You know, if you fail, it's your responsibility not mine? Let me try. Boys: One, two, three... Not bad. How you doin', j.T.? Doin' good. Nice out here, isn't it? Yeah. That's what you came out here to tell me? Oh, no, I came out here 'cause I wanted to get a sun tan. Yeah, me too. You're cool, man. Real cool. Thanks. You know, I mean it. Checked your record. Lots of ability. Lots of brain. That's cool. But throwing away diploma just to blow black on some white kids, that's not so cool. All you want to do is protect them honkies. Man, you got honkies on the brain. Yeah, well, your crazy if you think sixty devils going to come in here and make it, Jones. They are here. Now, be cool. Don't get yourself booted out just because you got a thing against whites. Look, they don't want us in their schools, we don't want them in ours. How's it going? Fine. As long as we stay in the reservation. I'm hip. Look, it's not going to be easy. Some of the teachers can help. But I'm afraid you're going to have to handle most of it yourselves. Yeah, but it's hard. Sure. Just because you're outnumbered, I don't want you to start feeling that all the black kids are down on you. That's the way I find it so far, Mr. Davis. Good. Now, there's always somebody who wants to play hard. So, you got to be with it. How? Well, for instance. If you go to the washroom, it's always a good idea to go in pairs. Going alone is the easiest way to get shaken down for lunch money. I go to the toilet only at home. Now, remember... If you ever have trouble, stand up to it right away. Okay? If you do need me, give me a blast, huh. Hey, any volunteers for the John? Move it out. You Mr. Davis? Yes. Well, I'm rodger Perkins' father. Rodger... No, no, look. I don't want to make any long speeches. I want to get my boy out of this place. Rodger. Let's go. We're going home. Well, I don't understand, he's doing fine. Doing fine? Things are running wild down here with you people. What people, Mr. Perkins? I think you know what I mean. Come on... Pa, I'm doing okay. Shut up! Now, listen. I pulled some strings with a councilman I know. It's all taken care of, Mr. Davis. Mr. Perkins, there are problems here, sure. Just as there are out there. Oh, yeah? Whose fault is it, all these problems, Mr. Davis? Good question. Well, you worry about it. No. You better worry about it. Mr. Davis. Sir! It's your... Oh. Well, thank you. Oh, sir. You got a minute? Sure. Sure. At my old school I played basketball. Yes? Well, the trials are coming up next week. I thought I might go in for the team. Well, I don't know, Doug. It's a chance. Yeah, it is. Now, remember what's happening. I don't know, man. I don't dig the scene. We are supposed to be playing ball. Man, when I was a negro I had white friends, but I'm a black now, I ain't got none. So, don't uncle Tom me, you hear? Cool? Coach: Squad one and two. Let's go! Let's go. Let's go. Hi. How's it going? Hi. J.t. Get it, Rick! I think you better get him out of there. Coach: Okay, squads three and four. Coach: Come on, junebug! Move it. Get in there! All: One kick, two kick, hop, turn. One, two, three, kick. One, two, three, kick. One kick, two kick, hop, turn. Halt! Jumping Jacks. One, two, three, four, turn. One, two, three, four, turn. Six more for daddy. All: One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three, four, hey. One, two, three... Johnson... Don't you have Mr. Stuart's class right now? Yeah, but I had to study for a test, Mr. Davis. Oh, come on, man. You ain't studying nothing but the foxes. Mr. Stuart, he's... Well, there's the bell. Johnson, you come along with me. I can't. I got to go to work. Come along, Johnson. You got time to study the foxes, you got time for me. It will only take a minute. Come on. But I got to go. Come on, Johnson. I thought that's what them dudes do only after they get rich. Uh-uh, even low life slum niggers likes them. Come on, amory, let's go. Why don't you sisters stop woofing on people? Why don't you just cool it? Cool it? You're always talking about being black. Soon as one of you niggers see a little white stuff, you go up in smokes. All that "black is beautiful" turns to bull shit. Come on, she's crazy. Yeah, go ahead, run. Take your little miss clairol with you. Not any kid can keep a class laughing the way you do. Must be pretty sharp, have good tools. Well, that's true, I've a pretty good tool. Well, how come you can't read. You know I don't know. Come on, man, you do. I don't remember. Well, you better call your boss 'cause we are going to be here for a while. Sit down. I never got around to it, okay? How come? I don't care. Well, I care. Now, you're going to read. Oh, man, what for? You know as well as me, long as I shows up here you gotta promote me. That's the way it is down here. I don't give a damn how it is down here. You're going to learn to read. What? This here is a baby book I know, I know. But we are going to start here and work our way up, lerone. I'll tell you what. Take it home with you and start reading tonight. I gotta... I don't want any arguments about it. Why do I have to read this? Don't ask any questions, just do what I tell you. Okay? Quincy: Yeah, and there goes your ball game. Yeah. Hold on a second, will you? Where did you get that? In a trash can. Hey, let me call you back, eh? Yeah. I gave it to Johnson, so he could learn how to read. If the other kids saw him with it, he'd never live it down. The three little pigs just doesn't work here. Then what does work? Welcome to the club. How do I get him started, huh? He's been going to school for 11 years and he can't read. I mean, you can just see how bright that kid is. And that's what hurts. This place is like Disneyland. One teacher walks around eating carrots. He doesn't care, so why the hell should the kids? Monahan, she thinks she's some kind of missionary down here. Sets no standards. 'Cause she's just so sure us niggers can't learn nothing anyway. And wilkerson... He'd like to put bars on all the windows. Christ! Must be a way. Maybe. But when you've banged your head against the wall as long as I have, you'll feel the way I do. And I'm going to be retired before I'm 30. All: * three, four gonna make that soar * five, six... But couldn't you have picked a captain? No. They wanted you. Now, come along. Hi, girls. Hi, delores. Hi, Angie. Good afternoon. How are you today? Fine. All right, girls, let's do but can you dig it okay? Girls: Okay. He's gorgeous. Keep quite. He might hear you. Can't help it if I dig older men. All right, girls, do your thing. All right, set, one, two. * something inside us won't let us rest * but can you dig it? 'Cause our team is really the best * but can you dig it? Going in and out of our minds * but can you dig it? Going... Now, that one will be better. * but can you dig it? Mighty lions are what we are called * but can you dig it? Step aside and give us the ball * but can you dig it? Here tonight looking brave and bold * but can you dig it? Hey, the mighty black and the gold * but can you dig it? Hey, the mighty black and the gold * but can you dig it? Hey, man, what's going down? What do you mean? You know what I mean, man. You keep your eyeballs off our women. Do you mind if I breathe? You're a smart dude, ain't you, man? * but can you dig it? Hey, the might black and the gold * but can you dig it? Hey, the might black and the gold * but can you dig it? Come on, man. Somebody's coming. Let's go. Don't touch me, I don't want any of you near me. Okay, kid. Take it easy. Take it easy. I'm getting out of here. I'm getting out of here. All right, kid, okay, we'll talk about it later. I don't want to talk about it later. I want a transfer right now. Doug, listen to me. There are no more transfers. You'll have to wait till next term. I'm sorry. You mean I gotta stay here after this, huh? If you want to graduate. You know I'll help you as much as I can. Man, you discriminate against me, just like they do. I mean, you downgrade my papers, you're not giving me the grades I deserve. Man, you discriminate against me 'cause I'm white. Now, Doug, stop. 'Cause I'm white. Stop getting paranoid. Yeah, 'cause I'm white. Now, look... Don't tell me about discrimination. You know how I see it? Just don't. You know how I see it? They can't stand being shown up. They quit before they start, so they take it out on me. And you're doing the same thing. Man, you guys really stick together, don't you? Oh, you're all alike. All right. That's it. Break it up. It's all over. Let's go. Defending the white folks. Man, you just like them darkies on TV. Gang up time, eh, j.T.? Real tough. Oh, look man. Why don't you just hustle on back where you came from. We got these honkies on the run down here. You know... I don't even remember liking this stuff. Maybe it's because of that kid I didn't eat anything but. Go on. I grew up playing basketball right around the corner. Where? Oh, you know I made a... a hoop from a clothes hanger. Attached it to a lamp post so I'd have enough light. I'd be out there shooting 10, 12 hours a day. Even in college it was all basketball. Seven days, 40 hours a week. It was my whole life. Dint you ever do anything but play ball? Nope. Oh, sure the coach said, "education came first." But you won or you're out. I mean, books, forget it. I never read a thing I wasn't forced to until one day I picked up a copy of treasure island. You know, I stayed up all night reading it. Got so caught up in it I couldn't stop. And then I just read myself right through the public library. Books, I mean, just blew my mind. And after that, well, I took a different road. Because you didn't want other kids to miss what you had found, right? No, I never thought about that. I... Yeah, I guess so. And look where it got you, Lafayette high school. Could be worse. Could it? Oh, come on. You're a teacher. Oh, well, thank you for telling me, Mr. Davis. Where have you been? I've been there four years. And I'm telling you, it is hopeless. Okay. Okay. There are no answers. And nothing works down there. Well, damn it. Let's find something that does. Are you kidding? With those old fogies downtown running the show? Oh, they are riding into the sunset. Well, they are taking their own damn sweet time about doing it. Look... I don't know what the answers are, but I tell you one thing, if the mold doesn't fit the kids, then maybe we should break the goddamn mold and save the kids. Oh, Mr. Davis. Yes. Rodger thornbush. The state board of education. Hi. The story of my life. You don't know why I'm here. Well... I'm conducting a test. Test? What sort of test? Simply trying to Gauge the comparative achievement levels in some of our schools. We... we sent you a letter about it. Oh, yes. Mr. Thornbush, I'm sorry, but I'd rather not. I mean, this test may do something for you and the board, but not for my class. Mr. Davis, I have my instructions. In that case, I'll have to take it up with the principal. I already have. Now, do you all understand? All I want is a simple definition for some words. We'll start with this young lady and work back. "Collateral." "Collateral." uh... Uh... Uh-uh. Next, "utopia." "Utopia"? "Utopia." That's some kind of, um, special place, like, uh... I don't know. Next, "incentive." Goal. Motivation. Very good. Next, "turgid." Oh, yeah, yeah! I know. He's the kid who lives upstairs. Mean mother. Next, "thermofax." Man, how come every test we get these same old bullshit words? Mr. Davis. Yes? Next, "automated." Oh, man, leave me alone. Ask the honkies. Next row, "escalation." I think that's enough testing, Mr. Thornbush. Mr. Davis, I haven't finished. Oh, yes, you have. Now just a... Mr. Davis! Okay, okay. Now, I know that test shot some of you down, but just because you don't know the meaning of words like "thermofax" and "utopia" doesn't mean you can't cut it. It all depends on what's been available to you. What you're into. Whether your folks come from Connecticut or Georgia. Dig? Now, just to show you what I mean, let's have another go at a test that's not in the book. Carter. What's a lowrider? Why, everybody knows that. That's when you got you a Batmobile, and you set it down low to the ground, and take off! Sabin. What's "going into a nod"? It means you're on the drugs, man. Doug, who was Wallace d. Fard? I don't know. Dupres. Well, that's the cat that started the muslims. Who's irvine? He... he's the fuzz. What's "working the roof"? That's old folks casting spells. Who died on February 21st? Uh, Malcolm! Students: Malcolm. Swahili for "good morning, what's happening, man?" Blowing your box? Playing am and fm. Mat and tat? Ma and pa. A hog? A Cadillac. And what's lye and potato peels used for? That's for frying your cock. Okay. Okay, so now we know just how much you all have on the ball, but you're gonna have to have a lot more. 'Cause there's all kinds of books and ideas and words. And you're gonna learn about them, all of you, black and white. And there will be no exceptions and no excuses. Clear? Beautiful. Hi, Mr. Davis. Hello, Greg. Afternoon, Johnson. Hi, Mr. Davis. How is everything? Fine. Glad to hear it. Well, listen, I've got some reading to do. Reading? Is that right? Uh-huh. You know, I'm very interested in your reading, Johnson, tell me about it. Look, there ain't nothing to tell, I'm in a hurry, Mr. Davis. Why? I've got a class, the teacher's a hard-nose. Oh? Who? You. That's right, isn't it? I mean, if I'm here, you can't be late, can you? By the way, I wanna see you after class. Okay, I'm gonna be there. And you promise? I promise I'll be there. Johnson, don't let me down. I'm not going to let you down. I cross my heart, hope to die... You're gonna be there? Stick a needle in my eye. I'm gonna be there. All right, Johnson. All right. Go on then. Mr. Johnson. Look, that wasn't no grass you saw me smokin'. That's not what I want to talk to you about. Oh, I've gotta be at work by 5:00. I know. What kind of work you do, Johnson? Cleaning out air-conditioning ducts downtown. Is that what you want to do? Look, if you white, you write, if you brown, hang around, but if you black, get back. That's where it's at. Not if you push your way to the front and hold on tight. Oh, yeah, I know. It's been done. Sure. You're gonna tell me about bill cosby, Carl Stokes and o.J., but you cats are super-spooks. You'd make it anywhere, anytime. All I'm asking you to do is try, and you can't try until you know how to read. I'm makin' it! Like hell. Hey, man, cut me some slack. Why didn't you read? Oh, man, not that damn baby book again. It's no baby book. Then it's William Cullen Bryant. Every time I hear one of them dudes with them three names, I goes under. Come on, Johnson, it's not what you think. I'm not reading this book. Read. "He pulled her to him, "her body soft "but firm. "Then he felt "the press "of her full, "heavy..." Read, Johnson. "Her full, "heavy breasts "and heard her sigh "with pleasure. "He felt the "warmth "rising into his "lions"? "Loins." "...into his loins "And kissed her. "She..." Oh, man, you've gotta be kiddin'. Read, Johnson. Okay with me. "She reached for "His manhood "and gasped with delight. "Outside, the trees shook in the wind." Oh, god, no. "'I didn't know it would be like this,' she whispered. "He had never known a woman so..." "In-sati..." "Insatiable."" "insatiable. "'Softly at first,' she moaned. "The moan rising as her body clung to his... "As her body clung to his, "her silken thighs writhing "her fingernails clawing his back." Oh, man. Davis: Come on in. Well, what can I do for you? Uh, I just thought I'd sit in and listen a while. You know. Me too. Mmm-hmm. Well, if you wanna stay, you gotta play. Rules of the game. That's it. Go ahead. "As their desire "reached its "pi... "Pi-pineapple?" "Pinnacle." "...pinnacle, "her whole body "shuddered against his. "'Don't stop,' she cried." Go ahead, I'm listening. "Suddenly, he felt a strange "sen..." "Sensation." "Sensation. "She had taken "a piece of ice "and jammed it "into his flaming flesh." "It was the most exci...Exciting thing "he'd ever seen. "He felt a... "Powerful longing "in his "lions." "Loins." "In his..." All: "Loins." "...in his loins." That was pretty good, Jimmy. Next time we'll do even better. Okay, now let's try something else. A writer by the name of d.H. Lawrence. Anybody? I want you to start right here. "He took her in his arms again "and drew her to him, "and suddenly she became small "in his arms, small and nestling. "It was gone, "the resistance was gone, "and she began "to melt in a marvelous peace. "And as she melted small and wonderful "in his arms, "she became infinitely desirable to him. "And she felt him like a flame of desire, "yet tender, "and she felt herself melting in the flame. "She let herself go. "It came with a strange slow thrust of peace, "the dark thrust of peace and a ponderous, primordial tenderness, "such as made the world in the beginning. "She dared to let go of everything, "all herself and be gone in the flood. "She was gone, she was not, "she was born a woman." Man, that's beautiful. Hey! Hi, Mr. Davis. J.t. How's about a little game? Looks like you've got enough already. No, no, no, a two-man game. Just you and me. Some other time. Ah, you might be too old some other time. Come on, let's see if your gun's still loaded. Hey, man, give me that, give me that. Hey, yeah, keep scores, man. Scores and time. Yeah, all right. Come on, quince! Come on, quince! Quince got two, man. Right on! All right! All right, j.T. Two all. Come on, quince, you can do better than that! Crowd: Aw... Crowd: Oh! Don't worry about it! Don't worry about it, j.T. Put him in the popcorn machine. Go ahead, j.T. Go ahead. Pop him, go ahead, pop him in... Eight-two, baby, eight-two. Give me another one, j.T. Hmm, looks like they got a little something going. Goodnight, Phil. I'll see you, Boyd. Yeah. Yeah! All right! All right! How come you're not watching the playoff? The what? The generations are meeting on the basketball court. Boy 1: That was a foul! Boy 2: Come on, quince. Boy 3: Come on, quince! Boy 4: Looking good. Looking good. Boy 5: Come on, quince! Come on, quince! Boy 5: Come on, quince! Come on, quince! Come on, quince! Oh, come on! Come on, baby, come on! Girl: Come on, quince, come on. That's right, quince, you got it. Tied score. We need a basket. Come on, j.T., get him, man, get him! Come on, quince! Davis: The little bastard. He nearly ruined me. Here. What? Put your feet in. Huh? Go on. No... No, I mean it. Go on, it's great. No. Really? Really. Well... Okay. On the rocks? Yeah. Mmm. Thanks. Come on in. Hmm? Come on in, the water's fine. No. Come on in. You've got to be kidding. No, I am not. Haven't you seen any of those Japanese movies? Yes I have, but you ain't no Japanese, and that's a fact. Get your feet in the water? Wow. Hey, that's really great, you know? Oh, man, it's not bad, it's hot! Hey! Watch that. What? You're not some kind of sex-maniac, are you? Yeah, didn't you know? You know, it's funny to see you laugh. You're always so serious down at work. Yeah, I didn't know how lonely I was till I came down here. Well, I'm glad you're here. What with parties and friends... Well, what did you say? I said, I'm glad you're here. Then why are you leaving? Quincy, don't do that to me. That magazine job pays good money. So? I need you. I don't want to be needed for any school. Who said anything about school? Go dry your feet. Carter? Huh? No cheating. That's not cheating, man. That's co-existence. And bring your papers with you. What's up? I finished this screwed up test a long time ago. You come with me. You're on your own till I get back. All right. What game are you playing? Man, what are you trying to lay on me? You know what I mean. You got a 3.4 average, that test was a pushover for you. Oh! Come on, it was a drag. You come with me, huh. Do something with that. Huh? I want you to paint a mural. A what? A mural. Come on, man. That ain't my thing. Don't "shuck" me, j.T. I've seen your stuff and I've checked with your art teacher. You can paint up a star. What, angels and chairs? Come on, man, get off it. Nothing like that. I'm talking about a wall of respect. Black heroes. Crispus attucks, nat Turner, Benjamin banneker, Frederick douglass. Anyone you want. And you can take all the kids you need to help you. Yeah, but, hell, man, the man he... I'll take care of the man. You take care of the wall. All right? Sorry about that. Wait a minute. Hold on, sister. Hold on. See, this here gesso it seals the wall. Dig? Uh-huh. All right, well, unless you really lay it on heavy, it ain't gonna seal. And the paints gonna... It's gonna seep in. Oh... oh, I get you. All right, okay. Don't be afraid. Go on. How am I doing? Out of sight. Give me that, would you? Man, that don't look like no mural to me. You got to lay the gesso on heavy for a free drawing. Then you got to draw the perspective lines. Otherwise you get all messed up, man. You dig? I'm a free soul, man. I don't see how come we just don't go ahead and paint the mother. Girl: Will you leave him alone? Hi! You get the message? Not bad, huh? Yeah, but there's somebody left out. Jimmy: Who? Uh, John brown. Hey, who that hunky? That's no hunky. That's John brown. Even Malcolm dug him. Damn it! Hi. Hi. Oh, say, listen. Yeah? What's the difference between a cosine and a tangent? What? All term long they've been busting my back with cosines and tangents. And every time I think I got it right, I got it wrong. Yeah, let me see it. It's a lot of crap. Oh, maybe old Johnson would know. Hey, Johnson. Give me a hand here, man. I'm a having a... What do you say, leak? Nothing. Nigger lover. Oh, lerone, that's wrong. Let me show you. Watch. Have a triangle, right? Black power. The only power they got is in their pants. Will you knock it off, huh? After what they did to you, you're still sucking up to them. Look, man. I'm not crazy about them all, but I got to live here. Oh, yeah? Well, I don't. I'm getting out of this one way or the other. Hey, Johnson. You... you got a minute? Yeah, okay, man. We'll see you. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, okay. What you want? Come here. Come here, come here. Listen, uh... You got any chicks? You know, a hooker. No. Come on, man. You must know a hundred colored chicks selling it. Hey, man. What's the matter with you? Hey, quit it, would you? Leaky: Goddamn... Hey. Break it up, break it up. I said, "break it up". Damn, nigger! I'll show you! God, you want to hit somebody? Hit me. Go on. Stop! Stop it. Stop! Stop it. Lorraine: Stop it! You'll hurt him. Stop it. You black bastard. Somebody! Stop it. Lorraine: Stop him. Bastard... I'll give you a goddamn Korean war! Stop it. Davis: No, it wasn't Johnson's fault. I don't care, they both go. Mr. Wilkerson, if that kid can graduate, I can get him... We can't have them here. I'm begging you. Don't waste it. When are you going to learn. This wouldn't have happened if you got rid of that j.T. Watson when I said. Look, I can't afford to have any more trouble here. The newspapers and television live on this sort of thing. I have a reputation to maintain. Reputation? Yes, a reputation. And I'll not have it said that Boyd wilkerson can't control his school. What do you control this for? So, I can get out. I'm not wanted down here. There's an opening on the board next year and I'm getting it. And what do we do till then? These kids are calling for help now. What are we going to do? I'll tell you what you're going to do. You're going back to teaching. From now on, there'll be no more murals, no more sex books. No more basketball games with the students. We're going back to the rules. They don't work anymore. I'm warning you, Davis. You do it my way or you're out of the system. We're going back to established procedures. To hell with established procedures. They are dried up and they don't work. We have got to find new ways. Ways that will give these kids some kind of a chance. What's going to happen? What happened? Kick them out? Johnson too? Mmm-hmm. But that ain't right. This never would've happened if we got rid of them honkies. That wouldn't have changed a thing. Not for any of you. Hell! You thought he found his mind down here? You thought he could do something? But when push comes to shove, you can't do nothing. Well, I know what I'm going to do. Quincy! Where you going? I don't know. I'm just getting the hell out of here. You just can't go away. Why not? What's the use? Please, listen to me. Quincy. Now, you once told me that if I left, it was like telling those kids that there was no way out. No hope. Well, now I'm telling you. You can't leave. The hell I can't. Look, they got their indifference and their hate. So what do they need me for? * do you hear it * can't you hear it * reachin' out to you * trying to touch your hand * and asking you to understand * you gotta understand * reachin', reachin', reachin' * reachin' out to you * tell me * do you see it? * can't you see it? * reachin' out to you * trying to show your eyes * trying to make you realize * reachin' out to you * you know you got to realize * life is * rising like a muddy river * falling * falling like the evening sun * crying out * they're crying out to every brother * to every brother * telling it to everyone * to everyone * reachin', reachin', reachin' * reachin' out to you * do you feel it? * can't you feel it? * can't you feel it in your heart? * asking for love to start * asking for love, love, love * reachin' out to you * feel it, feel it, feel it * whoa, yeah * feel it in your heart * asking for love to start * reachin' out * to you Hi. Tell us something. Yeah. Something personal. Like what? We wants to know you blonde all over? Hey! Hey, now look. Hey, come on. Let me through. Hey, come on. Don't do this. Please don't. Oh! Stop it. Stop! Stop, stop. Stop or I'll... Stop it. Girl: What did I tell you? Why don't you go back where you come from, boy? Oh, come on. We don't want you down here. You honkies have given us enough trouble. Look, I had nothing to do with Johnson getting kicked out and you know that. Girl: No, don't. Boy: Punch him, j.T. Punch him! Hit him, j.T. Break it up. Stop it. That's enough. Stop it. I want to see you both in my office. Quincy: Everybody, back to class. I want no honkies. We're not going nowhere. Right on! Strike! Students: Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Stop it. Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! That's enough. Now cut up. Now cut it out! Everybody, back to class. Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Boy: I'm gonna kill that goddamn honky. Come on, fellas. Now... now, boys! I'm on your side, but we cannot have this. I demand that you return to the class. Students: Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Black power! Power! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Listen to me, all of you. This is not a jungle. I warn you. Get inside, all of you, or every single ringleader will be expelled. I warn you. Get inside, all of you. For the last time, get inside or I'll call the police. Let me handle this, will you? You failed, Mr. Davis. You failed me, the school, everybody. Mr. Greco, call the police. You don't give a damn, do you? Whether these kids push brooms or park cars for the rest of their lives. Well, I do. You're just serving your goddamn time down here. Get out. You're through. One of us is through. All right. I'm asking you now, go on back in there. He's whistling the same jive as them. Listen to me now. Listen... listen to me. Listen! Listen to me! Listen to me, will you? Listen to me. Listen, will you? There's something in there we need. Man, why don't you drop all that Tom jive. That's right, sabin. Something you need, something we all need. 'Cause without it, you ain't never gonna make it. Now, listen to me. I know things ain't the way they ought to be yet. But let me tell you like it is. The beginning. The first step is in there. Now, I know, maybe some of you don't want it at all. Maybe some of you are willing to give it up just because of a few whites in your class. Well, you going to have to learn. That white ain't right and black ain't right. Only right is right. We've got one chance now to make this place work for all of us. But I can't do it alone. I need you. Need any help? No. We can handle this by ourselves. Quincy: Johnson! Get on in there. All right. I'm going back, man. But I'm going back for my thing. Not yours. Well, that's fine, j.T. You think you had a hassle with me, wait till you get my kid brother. Not me, man. I've had it. You won't graduate. I don't care. Then what? I don't care, I tell you. Now, you listen to me. You have never understood why so many black kids give up. Well, you're doing the same thing. Don't, man. It's not the same... Well, damn right it is. And you've only had a taste of what they've had to live through all their lives. Maybe now you understand why they're so full of anger. What it takes to be black and survive in a white world. Come on, man, don't con me. Everybody knows they had to drag you down here. You're dying to get out. I'm staying. Well, I can't. I've tried. Then try again. Aren't they for this? Maybe and maybe not. Sure, they're not going to throw their arms around you. You'll still be a white kid in a black school, but at least they'll respect somebody who has the guts to say, "I have the right to be here." Hell, they've been saying that for a long, long time themselves. * rising * rising * like a muddy river * falling * falling like the evening sun * can't you hear me crying? * crying out to every brother * telling it to everyone * telling it to everyone * telling it to everyone * do you feel it? * feel it * can't you feel it * feel it * can't you feel it in your heart? * asking for love to start * reachin' out * to you
