Done at a swap shop at Santa Monica Boulevard But your cigarette case It meant so much to you Please,Janet,stop this questioning All right And don't play the injured wife,I hate it I know And it seems you're beginning to hate me too I might have known you would say that I suppose,you don't hate me at all No No,you love me Yes,of course,that's it You love me perfectly You couldn't dare to part with me,could you? Why else do I stay with you I'll tell you why you stay Because I'm the only creature you know miserable enough,to give you that feeling of that superiority And how you love it But you don't understand,Peter I know how bitter you must feel And how difficult it is for you to begin a ? all over again But there's only one thing to do You have to give up that silly pride of yours Now it comes Why don't I go to work? Why do you say it again? I never ask you to do anything you didn't want to That's why I took a job You've been supporting me for nearly two years But I did it gladly because I wanted to help you Sometimes I wonder you can be helped at all Janet -Hello,Hugo -Hello,Janet I'm lucky I got you today, I hate to walk to the bus Today is my fifth day in studio a wonderful job,not much to do,nothing to learn I said good bye to my ambition I make my living I wish Peter had your optimism But But what? Last night in the garage He tried to kill himself I've never seen him quite so bad before Frightens me I never know any more when I come home whether or not he... I don't know what to tell you It's difficult to be nobody Back home he was a great man But you've been through the same thing Well,yes but Peter is a sick man,I mean sick in his heart You still love him,don't you? Yes,of course I I still love him Thanks I'd rather not Ah,come,come Janet This is a celebration Tonight we are happy All three of us happy at the same time That's not very often,you know,come on No,Peter,honestly Why not? You can't let me get up and go to work early in the morning I see And I don't have to,do I? That isn't what I meant,darling That matter if you meant it or not Where are you going? To get me some cigarettes I have cigarettes My case Where did you get it? It took almost two weeks Yesterday I found it You are a sweet girl She gets something into her mind And she get through with it What's this all about? Oh,nothing That must be costly to get it back That doesn't matter Matters a great deal to me And then I'm going to pay you back And I hope very soon What kind of talk is this Yesterday you didn't have your case today you have it So why are you angry? Why do you think she gave me the case tonight? Why not yesterday? Because she wanted to humiliate me in front of you That it isn't true I know your sense of timing You know the exact moment when it hurts most I think we'd better leave Well,I'm not holding you back Waiter -Bring me a brandy -Peter Please don't drink any more You had enough -You heard what I said? -Yes -Fine I'll drink as much as I please One brandy Was it the money you're worrying about? -Your money -You don't have to shout at me You don't like it,why don't you go You're drunk again Oh,let her go Wait a minute,please I'm Dr Brent,you remember Yes,I remember May I drive you home?

It's awfully kind of you but I couldn't let you go alone, you're much too upset I don't really know where I want to go Well,let's just drive You must love him very much to ? I wish they stopped playing that tune Why? Don't you like it? I think it is right out of a cloudburst Why did you marry him? Because I loved him But he was so different then He was so full of hope and confidence about the future But he wasn't able to succeed here And he couldn't go back I guess he began to die A little by little Sometimes I can't help feeling it's my fault Your fault? If he continuously threatens to commit suicide Yes Because I thought if I'd work I could give him the little things one needs He needed more than just a roof over his head and a full stomach He needed something I was unable to give him His self confidence It must be terrible to be uprooted as he is I do not how but I so much would like to help him He never accept help from anyone Tell me why did you leave so suddenly the other day? I thought your wife was calling long distance My wife? I thought it was your wife There was someone you You called Monika Monika,she's my assistant Dr Anderson But really I'm surprised of myself if I spoke her in such a way that made you think she was my wife I'm sorry if I said something I shouldn't God,no,Monika is my friend,a very brilliant woman,by the way Intelligent,clear minded, and not at all emotional That's what's make her such a good collaborator I wish I could be like that You mean brilliant? No,unemotional It would make things so much easier for me What for instance? Oh,I don't know somehow I think it would make me feel free, free to do the things I like And what would that be? To live Just to live I had your car picked and there is a new chair in your office I hope you like it Will you allow,Sir? Where do you want me to put the trunk? Just wait a minute Monika,where should he put the trunk? Any place Leave it right there How much is that? -it will be 3$ and 75 cent,Sir -OK,keep the change-Thank you,Sir Monika how was it? Strolling through the woods all by yourself Pinewoods are all right but I missed the smell of ether Where is the key? I let it go till later David You changed You look 10 years younger Thanks Why the cases seems to have done you a lot of good It did Yeah I discovered something while you were gone You what?

How did you meet her? Well,believe or not I was waiting for a taxi Yeah,who picked up whom? But seriously,Monika,for the first time in my life,I really love something I guess it happen when When I saw her in trouble Peter,what are you doing? Oh,it's you What are you doing? Turning everything upside down like this Same things people usually do when they turn things upside down Conducting research my friend Dear Francis,that's the sister in New York, Now listen to this I have hung on these last two years hoping it would work out, but he won't let it And now something has happened that has changed my whole life I'm so sure of it That's all,she never finished I probably interrupted her I wondered what changed her whole life Or rather who changed her whole life What do you mean,who? Aren't you stupid,Hugo? If a young,attractive woman suddenly find her whole life has changed It's usually a man,who has changed it Oh,you're crazy,I would be happy for her share luck Look at this Found in one of her purses -What's in it? -Well,open it There's something scribbled inside CO902095 What's that? A phone number or car license That happens to be a number on a phone record Hear this I just bought it Tell me -Does she know that you.. -Of course not Very sweet and sentimental You can make(?),Hugo Don't you think it's kept a little common I think you are just a little crazy But we won't know before the third act But I can promise you It's going to turn out different than she thinks She still wants to get rid of me This time she shall have to do the shooting I'll take it Yes,hello This is Mr Urban speaking Yes Yes,of course I shall be there right away Thank you,thank you very much What is it? You know they just called about that recent job that I applied for some time ago They want me to start working right away,isn't that wonderful?

No,Dr Anderson,I have no proof, I mean in the legal sense Do you suspect her? Yes You mean to say that Janet? Killed Peter I was afraid of that That's why I came here,to warn you To warn me?

Hey,Kral,your first shot Coming Mr Coburn I'm very sorry,doctor,I must go But Mr Kral Good bye Dr Anderson ??Mr Kral,it was joint swell of you to come You listen to me,Burt I'm ready to bail her out for any sum You say how much I don't know but don't be unreasonable You've got to tell me why you are holding her Hmm Yes? Oh,I see Well Thanks,Burt,Good bye What is it? She can't be bailed out,David Why? The charge against her is first degree murder Murder? But that's absurd Melvin she could never have done it I must see her,I must talk to her I don't think you should Why not? Because you might be suspected of collusion You got to think of yourself,that you are a good man,your reputation Forget it,she means more to me than anything else They finally let me see you I've missed you so terribly I was afraid I never see you again Darling,you mustn't talk like that Nothing will happen Everything is against me They can't convict you You know David Sometimes I think this is a penalty I have to pay I wanted to make so happy Oh,but you have darling I've be happy every minute since I've known you You remember the little Joe Diner?
