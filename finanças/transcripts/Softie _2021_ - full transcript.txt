- Let me. - Thanks. Take the table. Got it? Watch your feet... Johnny! Whaddaya doin'? There's stuff in the hall. - Take your shit and get out! - Seriously? Go to your mother's! Start over! Get fucked by whoever you want! Get lost! - What's with you? - Screw you! Calm the fuck down! Get 'em outta here! Shit! Knock me over, too! Where you running to? It's so embarrassing. Embarrassing to move? You must be exhausted. Finally! You thirsty? Sit down, the drinks are there. - How'd it go? - Yeah, fine. Thanks. - Take the keys. - Thanks. - Johnny! - What? - What are you doing? - Putting the fish in the aquarium. - How about helping us? - They're gonna die. They're gonna die... SOFTIE What the fuck you doin'? You nuts? - Why? - What's all this paper? Getting rid of this shitty wallpaper. It comes right off. I like the horses. Don't tear them off. You were with the guy for 3 years! - So? - You knew how he was. No, things really went downhill. They got much worse. I remember that day when you were at your aunt's and he lost it... I was so embarrassed. He did take in your kids! It's not about him accepting the kids. He loved you and your kids. I loved him, too. I still do. But you can't stay with a guy like that. If you say you love him, why'd you leave? People in love can still hurt each other. That's how it is. It's complicated. You'll understand when you grow up. How old are you again? - Ten. - Ten! - I thought you were older. - He seems older. - He's mature. - He's resourceful. Mom! Sir, have you seen my mom? - Your mom? - Yeah. No. Sorry, buddy. Fuck! Whaddaya doing? Get dressed! You can't go in the buff. Hurry! You wanna be late the first day? Take off your shoes. - Yes. - I love them. - They flicker. - Come on! Take that off. Mom... - Yeah. - We're going. - Got everything you need? - Yeah. Have a nice day. Love you. Love you, Mommy. - Me, too. - Come on. Place your signs in front of you. Okay. My name is Mr. Adamski. I just moved to Forbach. I don't know you yet. So I suggest a little game. What kind of game? I'll call on you, and you tell me how you see yourself in 20 years. - How old will you be in 20 years? - 30. Great. What's your ideal life at 30? What's your job? Where will you live? Will you be married? Will you have kids? Maybe we'll even be divorced. If divorce is your dream, tell us that. I'll begin with Erna. Here. - Where will you live? - In Miami. How do you know Miami? I saw pictures on social media. I liked them. So I'd like to see what it's like. And you'd like to live there? I saw the beach. And I've never been to a beach. - You've never been to the beach? - No. Who's been to the beach? It's hot! Okay. - I've even seen the ocean. - In North Africa. I'd like to have 2 children. - Two children. - Well behaved. Okay. - That's up to you. - Because I'd like to be a policewoman. Policewoman? - In Dubai. - In Dubai? - Why Dubai? - It's beautiful. I haven't thought about my job. Or my city. But I know I'll have a family. What's your dream? - You must have a dream? - Answer! He's talking to you. Answer! The cat's got his tongue. I dunno! What do your parents do? My mother works at a smoke shop in Germany. And your father? - He's gone. - What does that mean? Is he dead? My father's not dead! That's not funny! So your folks are divorced? What do you do in your spare time? I take care of my little sister. That's not funny! We discover things gradually. You have time. It's a game and everyone's different. Sir! Where did you live before you moved here? I was in Lyon. And was your dream to move to Forbach and be a teacher? My dream was to become a teacher so I could ask questions. He got you! Hey, brat! Hi. Was it cool? What'd you do? Johnny... I'm the old mummy... Mummy... Where does it hurt? Go higher. - Yeah, there. - On top? Yeah. - It's really dumb. - What? No other schools have religion classes. You're lucky. No, it's weird. Who told you that? The teacher. He didn't even know that existed. He thinks it's weird. Why weird? 'Cause we're in a public school, and not with the nuns. I believe in God. I'm not saying I wanna stop believing in God. I just wanna quit those dumb classes. Whaddaya want me to do? Write me an excuse. Well, write me a sample. I don't write that stuff. But I still want you to make your communion. I know. What's God to you? God... To me, God's love... sharing, the beautiful children He gave me. A little angel, like you. God's lots of kisses, lots of hugs. Who made Sarrebruck the capital of Germany? I did. Whoever wrote Sarrebruck, I'll kill! Erase that immediately. - Is it Sarreguemines? - Are you kidding? This is an exam. It's every man for himself. I'll help you a little. The capital of Slovenia? - I know! - Nabil! Kisisis... Casisis... Cat is is... Kacisis... - Ljubljana. - Yes, thank you. How's it spelled? L-J... U... B-L... J... A-N-A. Luxembourg... Good. Madrid, Rome... Lisbon. I got Copenhagen, from Myriam. I love it. Very good. What's the capital of Poland? - Warsaw? - Warsaw... And where's Oslo? - You wrote Helsinki. - In Sweden? No, but not far. - Oh, right, Norway! - Yes. Trust yourself. You know this. Thank you. What's your brand of cigarettes? Camels. And you? Does your dog smoke? Yes, he smokes from time to time. You see! My baby, too. Oh, this dog. Gucci! Your husband left? Why'd he leave? He took the car to go get cigarettes and he never came back. He didn't like to walk, so he took the car everywhere. Even just around the corner. So now I have to walk everywhere or call a taxi. Look! Come over here! - Two seconds. - What's up? What breed is that? - What? - What breed of dog? - A Husky. - Really? Can I pet him? He doesn't bite? - No. - You sure? What's his name? Gucci. - Who named him that? - My mom. - Does he like this? - No. - I think he does. - No, that's bad. It's good for dogs. Stop! It's bad for dogs, I said! - It's Red Bull. - He's old enough. - No, stop! - Bring him here. Take off! - Get lost! - We're not hurting him. Plus, his name's Gucci. - No way! - I swear. - Fuck, stop! - What's going on? - Take off! - Hey! I'm talking to you! What is this? - Hello, ma'am. - What's going on? You attack my son, then say, "Hello"? Want a kiss, too? - You nuts? - What's wrong? - What do you mean? - Who are you? I'm his mother! What's it to you? - Dressed like that? - I'll whip you like a dog. - You can't whip me! - You sure? You sure? This one? How we gonna do this? Don't touch me! We respect you, so respect us. What? You respect me? - I respect you. - Really? Now I don't but... Touch my son again and see what happens. You and your tits are starting to get us hot! Fuck! Now this thing's stuck! I've fucking had it! Do they think they own the damn 'hood? You've gotta learn to defend yourself! Your brother's no problem. He can defend himself. You gotta learn! I'm talking to you! Why can't you defend yourself? You gonna be like that your whole life? Whaddaya do when I do that? Get over here! Here! Now whaddaya do? This is for your own good! We live in the projects! Let me go! They hit you, and you it back! If anyone gives you shit, squeeze their head and break their nose, understand? - You're sick! - Yeah, I'm sick! Stop being such a wimp! One more minute. Give it all you've got! Take pleasure in running! Super! Everyone back in the center! When you run like that, what does your heart do? Hurt! - It accelerates? - It hurts? Yeah. No, it's accelerating. That's normal. It's oxygenating your muscles. If you stop now, you stop oxygenating your muscles and tomorrow you'll be... - Stiff! - Stiff, crampy, achy. Good! Your heart accelerated. Meaning that your heart rate accelerates. What is a heart rate? Your heartbeat? It's the number of heartbeats per... Per minute. How do we measure that? We'll need something to measure it per minute. A calculator. Repeat that for everyone! A calculator. Do we need a calculator to measure our heartbeats? - No, a watch! - A watch. So how do we measure our heartbeats? - I know! - Zineb. We put two fingers over an artery. Artery! That's a great word. Know what that is? You have an artery in your wrist. What do your fingers feel there? Exactly, your heartbeat. Feel it? For those who don't feel it... There's another spot where you can feel another artery, right here. That's the carotid. If you put two fingers there, - you'll feel your heartbeat. - I don't feel it. It's stronger here. Sometimes it's easier to feel here. Everyone, count in your head. Ready... Go! They let it all go to hell. So it's all caving in. The road's caving in, the land... There's nothing underneath. Mind your own beeswax. I am. Then why are you there? I'm not doing anything. It's a waste of money. It's crazy. I live right there. - Behind the high school. - Nice neighborhood... You have a whole house. A little garage for your bike, your motorcycle. You're privileged. What is this? "My son..." what? "My son no longer wants..." L-O-N-G-E-R, I think. Why are you undoing these braids? They're starting to bug me. Plus, they hurt. You sure "wood" is spelled like that? - Where? - Here. "I think it wood..." Yeah, W-O-O-D. Sure? I don't wanna look like a retard. No way! What do you think they'll do, if you make a mistake? Islands, Islands, Islands Islands we will never land upon Islands we will never descend upon Islands covered in vegetation Islands lurking like jaguars Silent islands Unforgettable, nameless islands I toss my shoes overboard Because I would like to reach you Blaise Cendrars, "Road Maps." Very good. That was really great. It was a bit fast, but that was great. Johnny, you're up! Island, island, island, island Island that will never land Island... - Did you learn it? - Yes. Go ahead. "We will never descend upon" Island we will never descend upon Louder. Island we will never descend upon You don't know it well. Try again next week. Pathetic... Excuse me? Hurry up, boys! Sir... Can I come in? What's the matter? It's about my poem. Leave the door open, please. I'm bummed out. I know it by heart. No big deal, you'll do it another day. Yeah, but it's hard in front of the class. Can't I recite it now? In front of you? Okay. Hold on... Go ahead, I'm listening. Islands, Islands, Islands, Islands we will never land upon Islands we will never descend upon Islands covered in vegetation Islands lurking like jaguars Silent islands Still islands Unforgettable, nameless islands I toss my shoes overboard Because I would like to reach you That's beautiful. Very good. And the work you did on the gestures is interesting. It helps me remember the parts I don't understand. - Does it move you anyway? - Yes. - Do you like it? - Yeah. That's what poetry is. Even if we may not understand everything, it moves us anyway. The poet takes words we might not necessarily put together, yet we find it beautiful. You understand? It's like music. So... - You wanna join the others? - Okay. What color's the motorcycle? Midnight blue. What's midnight blue? - What color? - It means dark blue. That's the one you were looking for? Who's motorcycle is that? Where are we? Stop asking questions. Come on! Yes! I won! Turn it off! Don't tell what we did! - Tell who? - Mommy. Swear! I swear! Where have you been? At this hour? And with your little sister! Tell me! I was worried. I called everyone. Yeah, right! Little shit! Mélissa, come here. Come over here. Move! Where were you? Answer me or I'm gonna lose it! Ever gone out with your brother at night? No. No? Then what is this shit? It's dark out! I was afraid! I told you, the crazies come out at night. No, no, that won't work. Want me to lose my temper? Wanna take the blame for your brother? Step on it! Tell me! We were behind a house. What house? - Who lives in that house? - I dunno. Do I know them? What is this bullshit? What did you do there? We hid behind a tree. What for? We spied on people. What people? Who are they? A lady and a man. What were they doing? I dunno. Fuck... That kid's losing it! You drag your sister into your bullshit! Let me go! Cunt! Johnny! Are you okay? It's my mom... We got into a fight. Come in. Does your mom lose control like that often? Uh... when she drinks too much, she lays into everyone. She could even hit you. Want to go to the hospital, to make sure you're okay? No, I'm fine. I don't want us to have problems. - Should I call the principal? - No, call his mother. We'll call your mom. So she knows you're here. No, that's no use. She's pissed off now. - We have to. - It's no use! Johnny... Do you know her number? - Yeah. - Tell me. 06-42-85-89-57. - Hello? - Mrs. Jung? Yes. This is Mr. Adamski, Johnny's teacher. - Good eve ning. - He's at my house. He's there? Then keep him there. Or I'll beat the crap outta him! I'll get you a clean T-shirt. - Are you married? - No. Why don't you have any kids? It can take time. Why'd you move here? I was offered a job in a museum in Metz. And Jean came with me. He was transferred to Forbach. Know the Pompidou Center in Metz? - No. - You've never been there? - It's too far. - Metz isn't far. Well, we don't have a car. Know where your father is? I can't remember. Not really. Do you see him sometimes? Yeah, but it's rare. - Know where he lives? - No. - Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome. But don't call me "ma'am." It makes me feel old! - Sorry. - You can call me Nora. Thank you, Nora. I photographed those kids in Lyon. - Can I go see? - Yeah, go ahead. I organized a photography workshop. Then I wound up photographing them! They're really beautiful! Thank you. Know what I like to do when... - I meet a new friend? - No. I take their picture. - Can I take your picture? - Yeah, but what do I do? I don't know. You decide! Whatever comes to you! - That's your choice? - I dunno! No, it's great! Very proud! I'll take you home. You okay? - Hello. - Hello, Mrs. Jung. Thanks for bringing him home. It's very kind of you. - Will everything be okay now? - Sure. Why wouldn't it? You still sulking? He works hard, you know. - He could go far. - I have no doubt. He's my pride and joy. But he really needs support. He won't make it alone. I do support him. I support all my kids. That's nice, but don't put ideas in his head. He gets carried away. I don't want him to be disappointed. I'm supposed to report what happened tonight, which I'm obviously not going to do. But it can't happen again or I'll be in a very difficult situation. Every family has its clashes. It can't always be rosy. No, but... Thanks, again. Good night. - Good night. Bye, Johnny. - Bye. It's over. That was very good. Take your seats. You okay? That was horrible! Were you scared? - You done? - Yes. That's a 6th grade exercise. I didn't tell you. And you aced it. Your comprehension's at 6th grade level. But your spelling's a mess! Do you ever read at home? No. Here. They're very short stories. My gift to you. Thank you. Try to read one a day. Hi. Hi. - How's it going? - Fine. - What's your name? - Johnny. Johnny, got any coffee? - Here. - Thanks. Hi, what's up? Hello. - What's your name? - Mélissa. - What are you watching on TV? - Animals... in disguise. They're on a boat in the water. - Like it? - Yes. And you, nothing to say? You lookin' for buddies, or what? Right, okay! What grade are you in? - Okay. - What's with you? I just wanted to chat, but apparently you're not into that. You're more into your phone. Slip me 20 and I'll tell you my life story. Okay, so you take me for a sucker. - Drop the "bad boy" act. - Okay... I'm gonna go see your mom. We'll train in a stadium, on a clean field, in the sun. Under the real conditions. Like in the Olympics, try to give the best of yourself. Even when conditions aren't as good, we always try to give everything we've got. Fuck! This sucks! She's constantly on my back, "You have to learn it." - She pissed me off. - You really cried? Johnny! - How are you? - Fine. And you? Good. - I'm happy to see you. - Me, too. Happy to be on vacation? Yeah... - You going away? - No. Doing anything on Saturday? No, why? There's a museum nocturn. What's a nocturn? When the museum's open at night. We have special access. We have the art all to ourselves. I think you'd like it. I don't think I can... Why? Because my mom works. We'll call your mom and ask. I'm sure she'll say yes. Our friends are coming from Lyon. They have a daughter your age. Think your mom'll say yes? Yeah, it'd be cool. I just asked Johnny to join us at the nocturn on Saturday. - Yeah... - Yeah. Johnny, could you give us a minute, please? - What are you doing? - What? He's my student. - Three coffees. - Yellow or blue? Yellow. 22.50, please. Thank you! What are you doing here? - Can I go out Saturday night? - Go out? Hello... - My teacher... - I'm working! Camels? What's all this about? My teacher and his girlfriend... Come around back. So what's the deal? I told you, it's my teacher. He invited me to a nocturn in Metz. What's this nocturn? - You don't know? - No. Basically, it's going to the museum, but at night. You know we can't afford that. I'm invited. It's free. And he's just inviting you? Yeah, why? With nothing in exchange? No, maybe just to be a good student. Stop clowning around. Please, Mom! I'll think about it. I have customers. Go home, we'll talk later. - Be careful! - Come on. Go, I'll watch Mélissa in exchange. No way. I'll pick her up and bring her home. I'll even feed her. Please, we really need this. We can't go to my place. My folks are a pain. And your mom's gone. Go see your friends or... One hour! What's one hour of your life? That's your problem! You're a real ball-buster. Can't you go read in the living room? There are other places to read. Here it is! I thought I put it in here. See, it's this one. It's cool! Wanna try it on? Nice, huh? Classy! I don't look like a girl? No, leave it unbuttoned. You roll up the sleeves... To show off your little bracelet. Hello! A photo with your son? A souvenir with King Kong? Come on! "My son..." Okay... Don't move... Smile! It's strange to see you here. Thank you. - Johnny's one of my students. - Really? - Hi! - How are you? Johnny, Camille. She's in 8th grade. She always manages to surprise us. Now she met a guy on the internet. - No? - Yes. They met on Facebook or... I don't really know how. - How old is he? - He's 37. I thought he was younger. 37 is fine! So I absolutely had to meet him. How long did they chat before he came from Algeria? Maybe 4 months. Otherwise, he can't stay. She doesn't have to get married tomorrow. In any case, they seem very much in love. I'd love to see my mom in love again! Then she'd leave me alone! Will you come back to Lyon when your contract's up? Actually, Forbach's great! Their slogan's "Forbach for good!" - Really? - Yeah. Don't you speak a little Franconian? A little. "Forbach for good"? That's so cute! It's not really German. It's Lorraine German. How do you say "pretty" in Franconian? Hübsch. Hübsch? Love it! How do you say, "I'm sick of your dumb questions"? Really? He just said something horrible! - And we don't know it! - No, I didn't! How long have you smoked? A while. What's it like? Relaxing. You're into guys, no? Got anyone? That's so cool! At school? In your class? Does he know? I recited a poem for him. That's so sweet. So he understood? I don't think so. Not gonna tell him? Know the touch test? - What's that? - You don't know? While you're chatting, touch his hand or arm, discreetly, like it wasn't on purpose. If he looks you in the eye, it's a sign. If he smiles... or touches you back... it means he's really into you. No, really! - Ever tried it? - Yeah. Know how to tell if a guy wants to kiss you? If he looks at your mouth while you're talking. - No way! - Yes. Never thought of that? You have to watch for the signs. Villeurbanne was tough. You sensed that the parents had no confidence in the faculty, were very suspicious. Here, it's like night and day. You think Forbach's gonna be hell. I was dreading it. And in fact, it's a stroke of luck. He's funny, this kid. He's very resourceful. - Clever. - I watched him at dinner. He was curious. I sensed that being with adults... He's so motivated, I try to encourage him a bit. He's your pet! I hate that! But every year, you always have 1 or 2 students who touch you more than the others. I understand. And he's so cute. We have to stop being hypocrites. We have feelings in this work. If you take that away... it's awful! You should encourage him, as long as the others don't notice. But I don't think it's outwardly evident. - You take him to museums! - That's Nora. - It's special treatment. - Yeah, but... I can't be a savior to every student! What are you doing? Playing dead. You can see I'm sleeping. You know, the teacher said I could get a grant. Because you don't make enough money. So I'm entitled to a grant. For my education. What education? To go to a better middle school. What's wrong with the Forbach middle school? Nothing. It's just that they're all a bunch of slackers. It's a middle school of losers. And where's your dream middle school? - Huh? - In Metz. In Metz? - What? - How you gonna get to Metz? There's a boarding school. - So you wanna leave? - No. Boarding school means leaving. No way, that's not it. I just wanna have a job I like. And what's this job you like? It's a job... Not a shit job! Not a job like yours. Thanks a lot. That touches my heart. It's true. I'm not saying you're shit but... You don't like your job. I'm sorry, Mom. I really need you here. Think it's easy, or what? How will I manage? I can't count on Dylan. It has to be you. I don't wanna be a salesman, or work in a McDonald's. Then whaddaya wanna do? It's your brother. What do you want? Can you watch her? Why? Please. Two hours, max. Where you going? None of your business. I'm with my buddies. Where you going for two hours? Can't you just watch her? No, I can't With all those guys getting high? No big change from home! - Yeah! - Come here! - She's your sister! - Get her out! Can't you help me? That's your role, not mine. - What are you doing here? - I came to say hello. - You okay? - Yeah. It's vacation. I'm kinda bored. Nora's not home? No, she's working in Metz. And what are you doing? Correcting papers. I came for nothing. Too bad. Go on! Can I use the toilet before I go? - Sure, go ahead. - Thanks. Just let me finish this. Stop! What's wrong with you? Johnny, what's come over you? Go home now, okay? What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop that, please. Stop. No, stop that. Put on your T-shirt and go home. Get dressed, this is bullshit. I said, put on your shirt! Johnny, get dressed! Get dressed and get out! Hurry up, go! Hurry up! - Sorry. - Take that... - And go home! - I'm sorry! Let's watch a good movie tonight. This is so good. I could kill for a cheeseburger. - Really? - I'd kill you all. It really does you good! Yeah, McDonald's is great. Who wants fries? - Not me. - Me! I want two! - You counting? - One, two. - Want any? - No. Want some? Good, huh? Like it, sweetie? - Are all the wrappers in the trash bag? - Yes. I'm stuffed! What are you doing here? - Is he here? - You have to stop. You can't come here. I called lots of times, there was no answer. Did you tell anyone? What did you expect? Huh? What did you imagine? You're 10 years old. You don't do that, at 10. You're a child. Jean could lose his job. Go home. Don't come back here. - He danced! - He stung like a bee! Is he dead? Is he dead? - Yeah, he died. - Yeah. - He was handsome. - I'm the most handsome. You don't have his career, I'm sorry. Anyway... Know Rocky Marciano? He's before your time. - I sort of know... - Heard his name? I don't even know him. Mohammed had a different boxing style. - That was his trademark. - I couldn't care less. - I don't know him. - Yeah. Okay, fine. Is there any Coke left? Any Coke left? If you didn't drink it all. Like I drink everything here? You don't drink everything? - Want some? - Yes. Not too much. - Why? - Or you won't sleep. But when we drink Coke, we sleep really, really well. - Really? - Yeah. With coffee, too, it seems. - You don't want any? - No. You know Rocky Balboa, the movie? Well, that's sort of Rocky Marciano's story. Why don't you buy the real Coke? - It's the same. - No, it's not! It's disgusting shit! - It's the same... - It tastes like shit. - What's with you? - Don't we have enough money? To buy a real bottle of Coke? Excuse me, little prince. I'm not a little prince, you're the little prince! You've got money to buy beer! But not a lousy bottle of Coke! Some kids don't get enough to eat... - It pisses me off! - Calm down. No! You're just passing through! Don't talk to me! - What's going on? - I can't eat this, I'm sorry! - Lower your voice. - Don't talk to me! - Shut your trap! - You piss me off! - Tell your son... - You fucking piss me off!! I'm sick of eating this shit! - Then go! - Are you kidding? You sit on your fat ass, waiting for the world to end! Well, it won't fucking end! Don't you realize we're eating shit! Nothing but shit! You all piss me off! - Why can't we have anything nice? - Johnny... You all sit on your fat asses, doing nothing all day! Waiting for the time to pass! I can't stand looking at you! - You deadbeats! - Get out. Shut up! "The sense of being eternal is one of the strangest," "most disturbing," "that a man can experience in his lifetime." "Sometimes, in the soft, solemn hour when the sky turns pale" "and fills with light, a man stands on his doorstep, gazing up" "at that marvelous alchemy" "of pink and red tones." "About to scream with joy, suspended in the glow of that first ray" "in the strangeness, in the daily" "majesty of the rising sun, ever new," "ever the same for thousands and thousands of years." "He can then experience that feeling, even if it only lasts a moment." "He also experiences it sometimes, when alone, in a forest," "he sees the sun set, and its oblique rays" "spread a slanting light under the branches..." Listen, Mrs. Jung, as you can imagine, I'm here to help the children. I get that. So I'm trying to come up with the best possible choice - for Johnny. - Give it a break. My son has no problems. Stop with that. He's not suicidal. He didn't wanna kill himself. Mrs. Jung, that's not what I said. But it's not insignificant to endanger oneself climbing on a windowsill. This morning, you agreed to let him see the school psychologist. Yes, but I don't want him to continue. - Why? - I don't wanna broadcast it. I don't want them to think my son's crazy. Kids are mean. It won't be broadcast. Still, he did it in front of the whole class. They all know. And now the school psychologist will have to talk to the class. Some of the children are in shock. - Then let them see the shrink! - Mrs. Jung, we're not against you. We're all working to help your son. This is my job. Trust me a little. Johnny... Please look at me, when I speak to you. Do you have any problems, in particular? Worries? Maybe problems at home? You have nothing to say? Why don't you talk to him? He likes you. He'd listen to you. That's not my job. I don't think I'm the right person to do it.. I agree with the principal. I sincerely think it would be interesting for Johnny... I don't think you have a problem, Johnny. But I think you should speak to an outsider. I don't get it. I don't know what ideas you put in his head. But my son's changed. I've never seen him like this. He works like crazy. Never has fun. All he talks about is you. Everything he does is for you. You put ideas in his head, and now you abandon him? No. No, I never have. How'd you screw up now? Why won't your teacher help you? 'Cause... 'Cause his girlfriend's jealous. Jealous of what? - He loves me. - What do you mean? He loves me. I'm his pet. Hold on, what goes on between you? What is this shit? It's serious, what you just did! You tried to jump out a window! Now tell me what goes on with your teacher! - Did he ever touch you? - What? Did he fondle you? What did you do at his house? That would be very serious! That's called pedophilia. You're talking bullshit. You have to tell me! 'Cause I don't understand any of this. - Do you do stuff together? - No. So it's all in your head. You're imagining all kinds of nonsense. You have to stop, Johnny. I don't know what's true and what's not. Why are you doing this? Children, this is the most significant moment in this celebration. You are about to receive, in your heart, in the form of this bread, the Eucharistic bread - your friend, our friend, Jesus Christ. Julian, the body of Christ. - Maëlys, the body of Christ. - Amen. Marlon, the body of Christ. - Giovanni, the body of Christ. - Amen. - Johnny, the body of Christ. - Amen. Angela, the body of Christ. - Tiphaine, the body of Christ. - Amen. - Jade, the body of Christ. - Amen. - Noa, the body of Christ. - Amen. Hello, sir, do you like it? - It was a lovely ceremony. - Thanks. - It was nice of you to come. - My pleasure. - You look very chic. - Thank you. - Did you rehearse a lot? - Yeah. - It was beautiful. - Thank you. - You having a party? - A huge party! Mine's a surprise. We'll see. - Want a Jordan almond? - Thank you. - Have fun! - Thank you. - See you on Monday. - Bye. Hey, cutie! What are you doing all alone? Where's your smile? What? Mr. party animal, put down your phone. - Why? - This is your party! - So? - Liven up! - Stop! - Come on, it's a party! - Come on! Are you kidding? - Stop! Chill out! It's a party! Help me out! Johnny! Johnny! He's a knock-out, my son! Give me my beer! Hi. Put her there. Your mom's a little queasy. She drank a little too much. - Will you take care of her? - Yeah. Thanks for bringing her home! I'm going to that boarding school. Next year. I'm taking off. Hear me? Hear me? I'm taking off! I hope you can hear me.
