Don't move! Hands in the air! I said drop it! Clear! Check the side room, we're heading down for Brooks, copy? Hands, show me your hands! Show me your hands, now! Don't fucking move! Damien Brooks, you're under arrest. Yeah. Put the shit down. Let's go. And there he his. Look at you slip. Yeah, it looks that way. So this is where you've been hiding, in plain sight? Well, I've been where I've been sheriff, I've not been hiding. Right. And all the same for the Sinaloa cartel? Yeah, me and El Gordo are cool, but this ain't him, it ain't me either. Look, I just came here to pick me up some weed. Fuck you. I got you, possession still puts you away. Not what you were hoping for though. I'll see you in about 10 years mate. Yeah, give or take. Get him out of my face. See you around sherif. At least four people are confirmed dead tonight. One British national and members of the Sinaloa cartel. Local sheriff under investigation after a drug bust turns deadly. Sheriff Tucker, can you tell me what happened here tonight, Sheriff Tucker? New information tonight as the has now placed sheriff William Tucker on administrative leave pending an internal review, after he led a failed raid on an alleged illegal marijuana operation. We'll have more details as the story continues to unfold. Sheriff William Tucker has officially been removed from office. Now his firing has come under scrutiny by the governor's office as sheriff deputies claimed the botched raid resulted only in 10 pounds of marijuana and a handful of illegal weapons. The deaths of three foreign nationals took center stage as the leader, Damien Brooks known as the Brit, has been sentenced to five years for possession. William Tucker has declined any comment on his behalf. Looking really good. Yeah baby, you pound that. Don't ignore me. I know you can hear me. Did you saw something? Come lotion me up. Can I literally get a workout in without you asking for something? Uh, can I get something before you getting a workout in? Don't start girl. Forget it. Yeah. Hey, don't yeah at me. Who's this? Who do you think it is? Your daddy. Fuck off, what do you want? Where's your girl? Doing Jack shit as usual. Get her on too. Psst! All right, we're both on. The babe and the bad ass, you know, I kinda feel it in my nut sack. Uh, you wish baby. - Are we on? - We're on. So what's the plan? Our boy from London just got out a few hours ago and we're coordinating a little meet up with him. I'll text you once I know what's what. I have to find that pain in the ass, you know who I'm talking about. I'll ring him in and get him back on the job for us. The brains. He's probably tripping balls on some Ayahuasca retreat in Peru. The brains, shit, he's high as fuck right now and you're going to have to sober him up enough to walk straight, much less do what he has to do for real. Yeah, I'll handle him. You two just stay on ice. My friend, proud papa, his little girl is about to become DA. To your boy, they're making us feel real old, don't they? Salute. Time is the enemy, right? - What you did. - I didn't do nothing. You're the only one that did a damn thing and I know the price you paid. Those two DEA fucks deserve every inch of the beat down you gave them. Would you stop? I only wish it hadn't cost you career. Yeah well, it ain't over. You know what today is? Today's the day that goddamed chicken flies the coop. I caught him. Brit? Yep. I'm gonna do it again. Redemption. Bill. Bill? I gotta go. Tucker? Where are you going? To work, I'll be back relax. The water's hot, the toilet works, sorry this isn't the Ritz. No, this is, uh, this is good. These for me? Don't lose them. Do you have any questions for me? Are we clear on your curfew and our meeting times? - Yes ma'am. - Good. You know I got myself a new pager, look at that. Basically. Okay so, in by sundown, we set you up with a few interviews to get you integrated back into the system. Everything you need is in here along with a bus pass and address of where you need to go. Now, you did time for weed and weed is legal now, so it's a little tricky. We won't be on you as if you had smuggled kilos of heroin or Coke but nonetheless, the law is the law and I gotta do my job. So don't be a in my ass and I won't be pain in yours, copy? Yes ma'am. Happy about the TV though. There's no cable, but it comes with a fire stick and the WiFi is decent, you'll survive.

You've got some balls. El Gordo heard about the move you made on his shit. Well, that's strange, cause I didn't make any moves. Yeah right, ese. Then we hear one of your boys in the hood fucking with one of our own. Yeah, okay. Well, mate think about it. love is love. Fuck you. Well, this is unnecessary. Let's calm this thing down, should we? Bring it down, come on. You really wanna shoot fucking holes in each other over a chick. That chick is one of El Gordo's daughters. Nice job, fuck face. I couldn't hold myself. Yeah, of course. Well, you know that does change things. But it ain't about her, ese, this is about the money that never made it to the DEA. I have no fucking clue what you're talking about, but I do respect the situation. Tell El Gordo, that we... Hey, easy man. It's okay bro, it's cool. I know it's cool. We're leaving now, please tell them to put the guns down. Fuck you. Put the fucking guns down! Fuck that shit. What's up ese? Put 'em down. On the floor. Uh uh, baby. We're leaving now.

Baby, put some more eggs on the barby. Nice. You know, your swing's getting better, Leo. Yeah, what would you know? You hate golf. I don't hate golf, cause I'm just not old enough or bored enough to play it. Or rich enough. Well, I guess that's why we are here, right? That's right. So you uh, ready to play the back nine with me? Call's been made, all confirmed. Got your caddies lined up? Mh-mmh Good. Oh Leo, come on, you can do better than that. You're making me nervous. I tell you what, you meet me at the club house and we'll see what's what. Sounds like a plan. There you go. How's business? Business? Business is great, trust me. Look at that. Well, I see your swing's getting better Leo. Thanks. Hey, it's great to see you. Game time. That's beautiful. Dude, what were you thinking banging that cartel chick? I was thinking about love and ecstasy and coitus. Look man, she came on to me, I just merely obliged. Obliged, you two are some dumb asses. You should change your names, brawns and brains, get the fuck outta here. He's late. Doesn't he have a curfew now? Like they got him an ankle bracelet and all that, right? He can hack into anything with a circuit board. That's him right there. Hey, how do you think he got the ride? Is there like a prison ride share app or something? No man, he's out of the joint for five minutes, and he got a free ride. Holy fucking shit. Good to see you brother. You look good. You too, buddy. Good to see you. Mr. Bentley. Mr. Brooks. How you doing? Good to see you brother. Come, bring your mama sugar. Hey, that's mine, cool it now buddy. Get your hands off my girl. Wait, you guys are an item now? Mh-mmh. Going on three years. She's a pain in the ass, but I love her. Love you too, babe. Cool. Come on, I missed you. Good to see you. So guys we all know that prison sucks, so we can bypass any more asking that stuff. You're about to become millionaires. Yeah! Fucking A, show us where to dig. It's game time ladies and gents. Game time. We always knew it was going to take a load of years to shake up the entire system. But with the DEA shattering and us fucking up the entire cartel network, they do not have the juice they used to have. That's where our strength lies. El Gordo's underground, that whole syndicate's disbanded. Maybe a few of his ex guys and sheriff Tucker, he was onto us. For a minute. But now people would rather Twitter their balls than doing a Google search looking for another legend. You've been searching, right? Anything on the Sinaloa case? Not really, other than some kid in El Centro doing research papers. That's what I'm talking about right there. Then what are we waiting for? Let's get what we've been waiting for, cause I am sick of this influencer shit. We need our real cash, now. What the fuck man, I'm I missing something? What's an influencer? You see that ass? She throws on a bikini and takes a selfie with some get skinny milkshake and boom, they send us $5000 a month. All right, here we go. Think skinny, Aha. No, uh uh. Boobs. Hold the bottle up. Yes, that's it. Think skinny. I fucking am asshole. But suck it in though, suck it in. Now give me some ass. Aha, that's it. What? Yeah. Serious. Hang on man, I've only been gone for five fucking minutes, what happened? I believe that we fractured our space time dimension into an alternate reality where the collective of self and society has shifted the influence, thus creating the current universe we're in. And let me tell you, bro, it's not a good one. Ain't that the truth? I believe that shit, ancient aliens, Prometheus, area 51, the vortex, that shit's real. The vortex. We watch a lot of history channel. No way, it's fucking bullshit man. That's 100% true. No, absolutely not. Not true, bullshit. Garbage, that's fiction, bro. That technology did not exist. No, it didn't, the fucking oninaki came down, gave the caveman laser beams so they can cut that stone. Look at how perfect that is. Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You think fucking space fairy creatures just came down to earth and handed out laser swords to homo erectus. Yes I do, and what the fuck are you laughing at? What's so funny, that's science. Crystals? - Crystals turn... - The more the better. Damien, just tell us our next move, babe. Let's get our cash and get the hell out of this country. Yeah, I love to hear that, love So here's how it's gonna go down. So I'm assuming these are up to date, yeah? Yeah, give or take a couple of weeks. Just shut your fucking fluff. Here we go, I've been looking forward to this. There you go, one for you lovely lady, and there's a couple for you. You are going to have to get to know these guys. Both of them are douche bags, early retirement after the Sinaloa bust went bad. Killed three kids between them on duty. Word in the street from my guys is at they're still at homeless just hanging out at the same bar here in Coachella, right there. Can't wait, right? Circle jerk time. These are guys who couldn't possibly get drunk enough to take or go home with them, they'd be onto us in a snap. We'll get creative, don't worry. No doubt about that. You jealous? Tiny bit. You the only dick I ever had. Now that's the kind of stuff that makes me miss you. Okay, what about us? That's easy, I need you guys to break into the old DEA storage warehouse. Get your hands on the hard drive and the trash bag logs, you know, from my old bust. Check. I wasn't going to make it easy for them. There's no way I was going to let them find $33 million in the desert in the middle of nowhere. You're a genius, man. You couldn't even have told them if you'd wanted to. No that's what, what makes them thirsty you know. Human firewall. So, we hack the mainframe's database, some shit like that. And then we pull that shit out and we put it on a floppy disk. Yeah, a floppy disk, and then we'll get in a time machine and go back to 1987 and put it into an old computer in my sister's room and drink Tang and watch scary movies. What is wrong with you? Maybe we'll go look for a pot of gold you leprechaun motherfucker. Fucking dick warts Ladies. Yo, you have 48 hours to pull this off from report. Clocks ticking. Oh yeah, I forgot. I don't have a motor, who's taking me home? I got it. Hey, I don't have a motor either. Fuck you, Jeff. Can I, I gotta go with them. Bye. Same old Jeff. He's like a fucking 12 year old. 12 year old stoner. So what's up with you man, you good? Yeah, I'm okay. Really? Yeah, I'm doing all right. Look, I know you're zan as fuck, you are always very chill, but Jesus, 6 years in the joint. Well, a perfect heist takes time, straight ahead buddy. All these desert roads look the fucking same. Yeah, they do. Look, I'm not the guy to question how you put all this together. Honestly, man, like the ins and outs kinda hurts my brain when I think about it, but I need that money and I'm here. What are you going to do while we're doing out there? Me? I've gotta get a job. Like a person, like a real job job? Yeah, one of those. Mate, I'm on parole. I gotta get a 9-5. Right. Like I said, a perfect heist takes time, right? You should take a left hand turn. When we get there, you drop me around the corner, okay? I'm being watched. No shit. Yeah. Shit. Here you go, god bless you man. Did this guy just give you money? Yeah, he did. - And you took it. - I did. Thanks. It's a nice day. Really? Yeah, look around. Dad. Would you stop? I'm fine, just been working late. You're working? You're retired. They retired you. Uh-hum. Honestly, we're worried about you. Who's we? Me and mom, obviously. I'm not saying anything. Well, your face says everything. Cut her a break, that guy's harmless. Okay look, I would really, really love it if you would come tomorrow, when they swear me in. I will, sure. Yes, mom will be there and he'll be there, but you're my dad. You'll always be my dad, no matter how shitty your life becomes. My kid, District Attorney. I get it from my daddy. Okay. Oh, I gotta go. I love you. Take a shower. Bye DA. But would you take it? You can't just walk out of an interview like that Well, when you've been the recipient of disrespect like that I would wonder if there is a law against it. You just need a job, Damien. I know, but this aint it. Sorry. No, absolutely not. That's a lot... Hold on, one second. You ever fired a gun in combat, actual line of duty? You guys carry? No, we don't, but I'm just curious about you. You know, just in case. I mean, just in case I fired a weapon some point in my life. Yeah, you don't follow well, do you? Yeah, that's what my mother always used to tell me. Your mom said that? Well, let me tell you something here. When you're out in the field in combat, mom's not gonna have your back, so that's why I'm asking Yeah. It gets real out there. I know you're thinking, no it's a mini course, gotta be safe, I bring my family here, but I'm telling you right now, that down by the ninth hole, some crazy shit goes down. It's cool, I just don't see the relevance, if I'm honest, You don't see the what? Relevance. The relevance? Relevance. Relevance, there is absolutely none of that required for the job. We have no relevance. I see that. Thank you. Have a lovely, will you? Damien, what the hell? I mean look, this guy, mini-golf? I mean, it's funny but kind of a waste of time. Can I just set up some SAB's myself? Okay fine, but it has to be approved. That's fair. Can I get some air? Go. Goodness. Well, I don't understand what you're so mad about. Are you talking about that waitress? Is this about the waitress? Leo. Mr. Brooks. Look what you've done to the place, it look nice. Thank you. We're opening up another one in may, we're really expanding. I'd really liked you to be part of my team. Well, I'd like that very much, pleased you considered me. Wait a second, this is the parole officer? I'm sorry, did you get lost looking for our model search? Joking, joking. Leo Cap. Layla Lopez. I'm here to make sure Damien gets a job. He says that you might be the guy who might be able to take a chance on him. Well, we are in the business of taking chances, Miss Layla. It's just Layla. Okay, Layla, okay. This is Francesca, she's my VP of public relations. And she'll be taking care of him, watching over him while he's working. We'll take you up to his new office, okay? Can't wait to see This is it. This is what? Damien's new office. Wait, what? This is bullshit. No, I assure you it's not. Mr. Brooks will monitoring and filtering scam artists, they're constantly bombarding this casino. From up here, he's secure and way from any cash handling or any real floor activity. Zero interaction with any of the dealers or cashiers, he sees something suspicious, he calls it in on the walkie and basically he's my eagle eye in the sky. And provided he can pass a standard drug test, he can start work tomorrow. I think that's more than reasonable, Mr. Leo. I guess what we need now is a plastic cup. Plastic cup. Plastic cup. Right away. That went well. You think you're slick? Why, because I got a job? No, because you're playing me and you're playing the system. Love, let's get one thing straight, okay? I'm not playing shit. I got convicted for smuggling drugs and if you wanna get technical, it's for weed. And I believe that is 100% legal now, so if anyone is being played by the system. Whatever. Something doesn't feel right. Have you ever thought of, I mean, just a concept, have you ever thought of treating me as a actual human being rather than parole number 15 on your to do list for the day? Because then maybe you would see that not everything is as you think it is. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Because then if you did that, maybe you could consider you and parole number 15, I don't know, seeing a movie, grabbing some food or something. You're crazy. Yeah, tiny bit. But you know, in a fun way not in some weird creepy Norman Bates kind of way. Right, and he just loved his mama. I rest my case. Buckle up. Yes ma'am. Gracias mijita. Ese, I just found out. The Brit, he's out and he's with his crew. Here, in Califas So do you want us to bring him in? Uno mas por favor. You have somewhere to be? Yeah, I'm on watch, new parolee. Who are you kidding, you've been done with all that by a mile. Not even close, got me a score to settle. I'm going. Tucker, don't you even think about it. This ain't over yet. Bill? Sheriff Tucker's back in the saddle. You got it. All right. Let's see if these access codes are worth the price we paid. Yes! Ladies first. Come on man, leave that fucking thing, come on. Dude, what are we looking for? I want 3%. It's a door. That's a door. That's the men's room. Will you stop staring at all the pictures? We're looking for a door, not a photograph of J Edgar Hoover Oh shit. Look at that. The master vault, and I found it. It's not in a vault. It's not? Look at that, man. Look at this, files, these are the files. I mean, come on, look at that, this is like serious shit. This is not what we are looking for. Come on, this is what we wanted, employee records, Oh, that has to be important, they saved it on VHS. It's VHS. Yeah. They're not going to store anything important on VHS. They're not? Maybe they'll have it on a floppy desk. It's not even a floppy disk, this is a CD ROM. You're just being like this because I found it and you didn't, it's okay. Because I told you, we're not looking for a vault. What are we looking for? We're looking for a freaking room, I told you a room... This is a room. This is a vault room, we're looking for like a server room. What is this? You're an idiot. And this is a server. What a fucking asshole. Go fuck yourself. You motherfucker, you can't hit shit, look at you. Fuck you, can't shoot for shit, that's why you can't hit shit. And that's why I hit your wife last night. Oh, you didn't invite me, bro. Nope. Let's go. All right, bud. This is why I hate coming to straight bars. Like look, you got a frat boy row and a bunch of club skanks who can't get laid by the life end. Relax, let them have fun. Are you having fun? Hell yeah, badass. Okay babe, time to clock in. Shit. I told you not to bring that stupid fucking thing. This is legit. Legit, it's a fucking vacuum cleaner, and lower your voice. No it's not, it's a waxer. God, you're a fucking waxer. Yeah, I waxed your mom's ass. We'll talk about that later. You know, why don't you carry this, you're the muscular one. I'm the brains, I'm supposed to be looking. You're the brains, all right. And you're the brawn. Oh shit. What did we do? Be cool dude, let me handle this. What the fuck did you tell those guys about me? I said you were a great guy. You're full of shit. No, I'm not. Did you always have that mustache? Maybe, or maybe it's just an awesome cover. I took theatrical makeup classes in college. You're full of shit. No, I promise you Which one of those are you on? I'll take the one in brown. Okay, what I'm looking for is like a... Should be a little bigger than these Seriously? There's fucking Christmas lights in that box, this room's bullshit. What do you expect, man, it's turned into a storage closet. Dude, I can tell by the back of your head, you don't know what the fuck you're doing. Oh, really? This has all the information that we need on it. This has the last known whereabouts of the Sinaloa cartel, this has the last known whereabouts of the truck, where the $33 million disappeared. So I think if you just give it a minute, let this talk to this, we'll be out of here. Hurry the fuck up, man. We're here because of you. Tony listen, I know you think that this whole thing is my fault, but let me tell you something, it's not. I didn't bang El Gordo's daughter. Yeah, well it's not my fault all right? Yes, it is. Think about it, I met Olivia through Damien, Damien introduced us. So this is just a big play by Damian, he was taking El Gordo's mind off of his money and putting it onto his daughter. So he's more concerned with me and his daughter hooking up than he is his $33 million. And when his $33 million is being transported across the desert, what happens? It just magically disappears? Or maybe that's what Damien wanted. We were just pawns in his game of chess. You were the diversion. Right, I was the diversion. Fucking Damien, that's pretty slick. You finally get it. Man, I'm really proud of you, welcome to the party. Hack this fucking thing, let's go. Hey, what's up? How you doing, gorgeous? Just here having some fun. Thanks for the drinks. You're welcome. How about you, you're just having some fun too? Yeah, same. Cool. Cool. Cool. Hey, hands up fool, remember me? Party at your guys crib, all right? Ladies, wait, what are we getting into here? Oh parties, I love parties. Oh, there's a party in my pants. She likes parties a lot. I got a party in my pants. High five High five! Pants party, it's a pants party. Ew. It's over here, come over here with me. It's so far. I know, I know, piggy back ride. Oh, fuck me. Oh yeah, this is ridiculous. You're a grown man. Oh God, okay. Okay, get up on this, come on, get on up. Come on, before I have to man handle you. You good? I'll get the car, throw their asses in, yeah? Yeah. Oh shit. Remember me? - Fuck. - Fuck. Papa wants to speak to the Brit. Damien, I'm not interrupting anything, am I? Hello, Layla. No, I've just been working, just doing my thing. Long day at work, not used to that you know. Right, work. - You okay? - Uh-huh Everything good? I've been a good boy, didn't get home late than my curfew, didn't even touch this thing. Let me see. I'm doing as I'm supposed to do, and now a check... So parolee number 15, you asked the other day. Ready to catch that movie? I mean, I could also put this back on and go home. Well, you're buying. No shit. You barely just got a job. It's true. Hey, I gotta put my shoes on again. Hurry up. Yes ma'am. It's good to be out, you know. It is. I haven't seen a movie in like, Six years? Yeah, six years. I mean, we saw movies but it wasn't in a it wasn't in a real movie theater. I get it. I used spend every weekend at the movies, I mean literally every weekend, all weekend. Such a nerd boy. Any favorites? Yeah, loads, too many to mention. I guess, I guess I'm a Bond guy. That explains a lot. Why's that? Danger, espionage, women. That's me, every day. The turn's the other way. Taking me somewhere new, Layla? Why, you're afraid of taking you somewhere intimate Mr. Brooks? Kinda scared, but, I can handle intimate. Is this intimate enough for you? Yeah. I could never have done this before, not, you know, not with a guy like you. Oh, you mean an English man. No, a parolee. Look, we don't have to do this, we can go see a movie, it's okay. But I want to. It's been a minute. Dammit. Women. It was nice though. Yeah. William Tucker, this is Francesca with Mr. Leo's office. He'd like to see you at the casino. - Who? - Today. Leo Cap. Go, meet me in the office. Sheriff Tucker, welcome to Fantasy Springs. So how'd you get my number? That doesn't matter, what matters is, how bad do you wanna close the door on that chase you've been on for the last six years? What are you talking about? A friend of ours wanted me to relay a message to you. Is that right? That's right. And what's that? I read in a paper a few years ago that a couple of your men killed a few guys in a bust gone bad over a couple of pounds of marijuana. Yeah, that's right. Well, that same friend wanted me to tell you that ends today, 4:00 PM. What's this, coordinates? I'd go strapped if I were you, sheriff. I always do. Yeah, it's me. It's done. Dude, it smells like shit in here. Like it actually smells like a mix of carrots and shit. We're gonna fucking die here. Fucking morons. Shut the fuck up white boy. That wasn't Cici. I said, shut the fuck up. The bags. Hey. Hey, white boy. What are you doing here, Olivia? You never called me back. Stop, Kuko? Come on! Don't do this Kuko, you don't have to do this. See, I told you she wanted me. It's true, I did. That was then, and this, this is now. And Papa wants to speak to your boss. Lady, we don't know where he is. We do. Together again. Yeah, as always. You look good. Thank you. Look, we're not animals here, we're just here to talk. And I can think of about 33 million things to talk about, you know? Look, Olivia, I don't have the money, I never have. You can ask the DEA, fuck faces. Wasn't my gentlemen, it certainly wasn't my fuck up. Oh no? Absolutely not. So maybe it was their fuck up, right? But they don't know where the money went. They said the Sinaloa bus was delivered to a drop off point in the middle of the Salton sea and no one ever saw it again. Everyone knows that story, give me a break, it's on the bloody internet. - So it's legend now, right? - That's right. Millions buried out in the desert. Many people have tried to find it, you know that? Daddy even took sonar out there, you know, excavation site guns. You know what they found? No. Don't fucking get cute right now. You don't know, no, they found bags of dirt with X's sprayed on them, buried deep. So now, you tell me what they are, what you've been planning and where the fuck is our money. Olivia I... The parole officer is a nurse? No dude, it's his daughter. Papa has been wanting to talk to you for some time. No misunderstanding, Mr. Brooks, only tell us where it is, or your people are next. My people are next for what? Last chance Mr. Brooks. Please. Papa doesn't give second chances, Damien. Calm, correct and recall. Kill them all. Okay, okay, okay. I'll tell you where the money is but we've all got to go, all of us, including these fuck faces. Maybe trusting me one more time wouldn't hurt. I'm sorry. My daughters will take you, that wasn't so hard, was it? No. Pride, is no good amigo. When you think you're too smart, it's not good. This is not about who is smart and who is not. This is about money. And this piece of shit messing with my daughter. No, you disrespectful piece of shit! Papa. You happy? We make $30 million a month, you think I care about that money? No sir. Fuck that money. But respect has a fucking price, and that price is $33 million or your heads on a fucking spike! So now, let's take a ride, yeah? Sounds like a good idea. - Let's go Loco. - I'll make it easy. - Let's go. - Fuck. If this is all for nothing and we're on some bullshit, fake chase, de mata. Calm down, Layla. Fuck you, man. So did your guys bring what we need? Of course we did. I don't think you're dressed for this ladies, you wanna cut me free? - Kuko. - Fuck that. Just do it Kuko. You tricky white boy. Well, I think it's gonna probably take me all day unless you cut my crew free. Do it. Hurry the fuck up Kuko. Fucking asshole. Okay well, give them the disk, log them in and answer the bypass code. What? Fuck that, no way, man. Uh uh, I ain't giving up my money. You're not? Jeff, just fucking do it. No. Jeff, what the hell? Do you wanna die? Listen to your girl white boy. Fuck! What's on the disk? The actual GPS location. Don't be putting something that aint right, my men will kill you where you stand. There, it's logged in, you can do the rest. I'm fucking done. Okay, show us where it is, Brit. Come on, we don't got all day! Jesus fucking Christ. Officer down, 10:00, This is sheriff Bill Tucker, shots fired. Track this call, send support. What have you done? They were essential to the location you dumb fuck! Who are you calling dumb fuck, ese, I'll blast your ass too. No, you won't Kuko, stop. Calm your man down. Yeah, you're right. You know, because this fucker executes two men for taking a step, you trigger happy mother fucker! Olivia, say the fucking word, fuck this money. What do you mean fuck the money? Daddy's going to be pissed. Who cares? - I fucking care. - What am I doing guys? You're fucking answering the code white boy. Fucking do it. Wait. No, don't wait. Don't fucking wait. Don't touch that fucking thing, Jeff. Fuck! Cover! Stay safe. Cici, start the car now! Let's go! What the fuck's happening! Mate, piss off, I've got this. Come on! Jeep is carrying the daughters of Sinaloa cartel boss Joje Gordinez, suspects in second SUV belong to Damien Brooks, copy that? That's far enough. Looks like you got me again, sheriff. Did I? I don't know what to tell you. You're going to jail all over again, all these men are dead because of you. Yeah, DEA, crooked as fuck. Couple of murdering shit bags back there. You don't know that. Don't I? Sheriff go home, spend some quality time with your daughter. What'd you say? I said go home, enjoy life. I mean, isn't that what the fuck it's about? Fucking enjoying life. There is no money. This was all for nothing, Brooks, just tell me it was all bullshit. I'm leaving now, this is goodbye. You're not going anywhere. I am, this can be the end here, Mr. Tucker. For both of us. I'll kill you were you stand, son. I ain't got nothing else, this is it. You lost your life, I took that from you, that's on me. Let me make it right, give it all back and some more. Think about it. You just took down the second in command of the Sinaloa cartel, you got a squad back there on the FBI's most wanted list, and there's a laptop that belongs to El Gordo's daughter with the IP addresses of their now on unencrypted communications. That's a huge fuck up for the syndicate. They'll reward you for this, sheriff. And for us, I think there's some wonder in it. Let's close the door on this right, shall we? You won't see me again. I don't know, and the money? They say it's buried out there somewhere. Right. Who knows? See you around, sir. El Día de los Muertos, beautiful, right? Yes it is. Thank you for coming today. I know it's not your thing. No, I wouldn't miss it, it was a nice ceremony. Well, you proud of your little girl? Mh-mhh. I got something for you. Dad. Go on sweet heart, open it. Hey, I'm done, it's over. I just want to be your dad now, if that's okay. Thank you. Come here. I love you Jamie. Hello? Layla. Damien, you're fucking crazy. I think so. You know we're going to find you and your crew. Papa will hunt you down. Well, it's a big wide world, I'll take my chances. What, you're making that last dramatic phone call to the girl who got the drop on the Brit? You won't have an old cop to save your ass next time. No, it's not that phone call. Just a polite one letting you know it's over. But I'm not, who do you think runs shit now? Well, good for you. Game fucking on. See I, I think I'm done with games, but I do want you to ask yourself one question. Where's your sister? You okay? Yeah. These fucking girls man. You beautiful son of a bitch. - Champaign. - Nice. Great to see you. Ladies, you look gorgeous, champagne on me. Thank you lovely. This guy. Come here brother. Great to see you. Shall we toast? Not without me. There he is. Ola. Hey, and here she is, a wild card. Guess daddy's going to be mad at me. Salute. So Mr. Brooks, how did you do it? You wanna tell? No, you tell her. Come on, you do it, I'm tired. All right look, me and Damien had been running drugs for your dad for years. And once we found out about the DEA bust, Damien decided it was time to make a little retirement plan. Our good friend, Mr. Leo Cap, he happens to be best friends with the head of the truckers union. Big Paul, it's great to see you. This is for you, tell your boys next shipment is on Thursday. We'll be ready, we'll have the boys circle the wagon. Thanks buddy. The car wash, that was just the perfect cover. We took the trucks that were heading in the carwash, diverted them into the middle of the desert, we swapped the cash for dirt, but somebody was gonna have to take the fall. Well, you know, this guy in prison. No way. I'd have been fine in prison. So I did the stretch, bought Jeff here some time to make plans for the second half of this thing. And we knew your father would be on to us, because we took his money and my buddy here took his little girl. Look I knew your father would be out for blood as soon as I made parole. And the data disk drive thing, they're just virus trackers for the cartels. And those two DEA guys. Bad dudes. Well, they're dead now. They got done for human trafficking, but fuck them. We knew there were murderers on the payroll for the cartel and they did know the last known location of the shipment. Yeah, but what they didn't know is how big of a raging hard on the sheriff would have to bust your ass. He did. And then your sister becoming his parole officer, I mean, that was up with that. So once we figured it all out, we used the sheriff and Layla as pawns to bring them all out into the open. Then the Sheriff swoops in, saves the day, sets things right, everybody wins. And as for you and me, mi amor, you wanted out, your sister's the boss now, she's probably going to fucking kill us. And I think, being millionaires, we'll have no problem hiding from her. Okay, okay, but where's the cash? Leo? All right. I've been cleaning that money for five years. The shipment's been on Rezland since the very beginning, and no pain in the ass, DEA, FBI or cowboy cops were able to get anywhere near it. There's nothing like an urban legend, keep people wanting and looking, buried treasure, MacGuffin, all that Hollywood bullshit. And what's it worth now, Leo? With interest, $51.2 million. I like that. - Cheers thots. - I'll drink to that. Where are we going? Uh, anywhere the fuck we want? Yeah, you choose. I'm gonna take a nap. Just make sure there's sunshine, okay? Papa, Olivia. Olivia?
