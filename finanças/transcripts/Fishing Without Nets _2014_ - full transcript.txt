After years of war and famine, people have fled. But those of us who remain must find a way to survive. These waters are my home. My father fished here. And his father before that. No other clans fish in these waters. But now, our nets are coming up empty. He was born at the break of morning. I'll always remember that day. He looked like me! The nose, his fingers, his eyes. And he looked brave. He got that from me. Now I lived for him. To feed him. To teach him. I have nothing in my pockets, but my wife and I have love, and with that we brought a child into this world. Praise be to God. Listen, I'm telling you a story. Wait, I don't want to sleep. Don't you see, it's time to sleep? Dear Hanad, once upon a time there were two people. Two people with a lot of wisdom. Say 'yes.' Yes. Is this mom? Say 'nice!' Nice. Say 'nice!' Nice. Say 'I love you.' I love you. Say 'don't leave me.' Don't leave me. I wish you were coming with us. I promise we'll be together again. What's up? Pour it in. My God... This is my job! You deal with this smell everyday? What is that? It's shark liver and guts... it's used on the engines. We need to get out of here, and take control of our lives. A monkey couldn't live like this, let alone a human. Look at you... you have to send your wife and son away with smugglers and you can't even afford to go with them. I work with the boys because... they're the only ones around with any money. They go wherever they want and do whatever they like. You know how to work engines and sail. You're a fisherman, I'm sure you know exactly where the ships pass. We need you and you need us. Those guys kill people. They're thieves. What if my father could see me? What would he say? Your Dad? You can't even afford to buy your kid milk and you're worried about your dead dad. I want nothing to do with them. I'm a fisherman. So leave me to this life. OK fine, you keep fishing. I'm going to go get what's mine. You? Become a singer? You a singer? Yeah. I love you and you know a lot of songs. But you don't have a singing voice. Sorry. How about me? What if I become a model? Like Iman? What would you do then? That would be amazing. Sweetheart, I'm scared I'll never see you again. He came back to the house while his wife was at the market, and his mother-in-law was there, but he had no idea. You see, he thought his wife was home. So then he gets in bed... with his mother-in-law. He stuck it to her! So when he finished his business, he went outside and ran into his wife and he said to her, 'What are you doing here?' 'Who is the woman in the house?' She said, 'That's my mom!' He was shocked! So shocked he dumped milk over his head, turned around and started pounding away at the cow so they would think he'd gone crazy! Then the mother-in-law goes, 'Get this man, he is not well. Grab him.' They grabbed him and pulled him off the cow while he was still pounding away! Wow, you guys... See, that's the age I'm talking about. Still impressionable. Who are they? They're the boys we should use to climb up the ship. We can train them, teach them. Young guys are great. They'll do anything you need. Everything you tell them to do, they'll do. How does it look? Act like a 'Commando.' He looks like a monkey! My God, he does look like a monkey! This is our land, our laws. These men are sailing into our waters. Fishing ships. The polluters. No matter the type of ship, we get our hands on it. We can make some real money if we go out and capture these ships. If your friend Abdi won't help us, tell me now. We need to get out to the deep seas so that we can capture a ship. An oil tanker. But I won't wait around forever There are others who can guide us to the shipping lanes if he won't. Hey China Boy, can I borrow that money we talked about? I need it. What's your problem? Why the rush? I need the money. What? Couldn't catch any fish in the ocean today? That ocean is ruined. You know that. And you come here running and screaming, upset over pennies. I'm a diamond in the rough. I'm bright, with a big future. You should really listen to me. You listen. You're no diamond. You're just a pebble. So how about the money? You poor man. You're naive, small-minded. How much do you need? Stop playing. Listen, you need to stop all this fishing nonsense. You'll never make it out of here that way. You'll end up alone. Unless you want some guy in Yemen to raise your son? I'm going to miss you two so much. I'll wait for you there. I swear to God, I'll wait for you there. We have to take a chance. When I was 12 years old, my father went to sea and never came back. I searched and searched, but I never found him. He died trying to feed our family. A man is not a man until he can feed his children. Only death can stop me from feeding mine. I know him, we grew up together. He works in the ocean, knows all about it. He could be very useful. Trust me on this one. What do you have to say? We'll share the reward. You'll make a lot of money. Are you scared? Are you? I'm scared. This ocean is dangerous. You can sink like a rock out here. No one to help you. Gasping for air. Reaching for nothing. I'm a fisherman and I'm afraid to drown. You're right. I'm scared too. But know this one thing... I will be the first one to jump off this boat and onto that ship. You should be there with me. Pass your phones. Pass it. Give me your phone. Give the phone. You can't talk to anyone, but me. How long until we get to the shipping lanes? I wouldn't be surprised if we got there by the afternoon. Get the boats ready! Get the boats ready! I'll take it. Go. Get down! They're coming up! They're coming up! They're coming! For God's sake, go close the doors below! We can't just sit back! Our policy is to cooperate, not to take stupid risks! Let's go! Hey, let's go! Open! Open! Don't do anything stupid, Victor. That's it, they're here. Go! Hey! Go! Hey! Hands up! Go! Get over there! Over there! Open the door! Open the door for him! Hey! I said hands up! Surrender! Get over here! Hey, get up. Hey, get up. Hey! Hey! Put that down! Drop it! I said drop it! Put your hands up! Put your hands up! Let's go. I said stay down! Look down! Heads down! Bring him in! Get down! Get this motherfucker on the floor. Stay down! You dogs. I said look down. Fucking pigs. We run the world today. You! You steer! Steer! Sail! Sail the ship! Take us to Somalia! To Hobyo! Sail to Somalia! Look at this, something is up. Is the guy a grown man or kid? Look at this. What is this? This is beautiful. Try it on! Wait! I'm going to try this on. Put this on! That's not mine! Look over here! I've never seen anything like this. She swallowed it, she swallowed it! The whole thing? Man! What if she bites it off? I've never seen anything like this. It's big, so big. My God! Oooh! Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman. Hi. How are you? Well. Well. Follow me. Hi. This ship is a wreck. I understand this business. I've worked in this trade a long time. You captured an empty wreck. It's an oil tanker carrying no cargo. The hostages are the only valuable thing on this ship. Where's the man called... Raymond Otieno? He's over there. Samuel Mbramba... where's he? Over here. What's wrong with that guy's leg? Sir, he fell when he was running away from us. No one will hurt or harm any of them. OK? But you've got to keep our supply chain flowing. Medicine... food and the khat for the army. Everything we need. I'll take care of the hostages and you do your part. I'll keep the cash flowing. Medicine and food too... You just keep an eye on these men. Take care of them. And leave the rest to me. I'll get us a good deal. The money will come. Bless him and grant him peace. Look, all we need are these white people. Don't worry about the black guys. Don't waste time with them. The money is right there, in these white hostages. Let me ask you something. What about that ugly chinky looking pig over there? Where does he come from? Is he African or white? What is he? I'm guessing he's one of those guys... what do you call them? Filipino. One of those Asians. He's lower than them so leave him out of the conversation. We have these white guys, but we won't get anything from the Filipino. We have our money from these white guys and get our fill. But it's not safe to keep them all in one place. Get in! Hurry up! He is saying, 'You expect my boss to pay $10 million to feed 20 of you?' That's good. Tell him we could starve. This asshole doesn't even know. Insurance pays us, not his boss. We'll get more for him than the ship. How much longer do we have to wait? If they don't agree to pay in a few weeks, then we'll put some pressure on them. Hey, come outside. Hey, come outside. Come outside. Hey, walk. Walk. Walk. Walk! Hey. What's wrong with you? Hey what's wrong with you? You look like the life has been drained out of you. Tell me what's wrong. You have a headache? What are you saying? What does he want? What's wrong with him? What's he doing out here? Who brought him out? We did. What's wrong with him? He looks terrible. Who cares about his health? Let him die if he wants, don't bother me. What will we do if he dies? We need him alive until we get the money. Hey Mr. Chairman, what's going on? We're still waiting for their counter offer. Ok, so press them. That's not how things are done, it takes time. They like to lie and play games at first. Just give it more time and they'll cave. They always do. They have to. Alright. We told him to eat the soap. You gave it to him this morning? Yeah we did and we know he'll wash with it, but I want him to eat it. Who's watching him? We'll be careful with him, like an egg. I'll make sure we're careful. Because we don't want him to die. Don't see this as something bad. We are good people. We'll give you good things. We are good. We are not bad people. Tell him! Tell him! Be my friend. Be my friend. No one has what you and I have... this is happiness... I'll never forget. Does he have it? Yes I have the cash. 25 dollars here for the winner. There's the money Wait a minute. Don't touch it. Why are you driving yourself crazy? Relax, calm down. Whoever wins gets the money. Everyone calm down. Are you ready? Yes. And are you ready? Yes You did it wrong, you forgot. Bullshit! He forgot to count! He didn't count! Wait a minute, wait a minute. He didn't say 'one, two, three.' Fuck you! He has to count ' one, two, three, ' then clap. We are going to start at three. One, two, three. One, two, three! Boom! Bullshit! I don't fight with this, I fight with this right here. My friend, you're a child. Why don't you go play with kids. No, I'm talking about being a man. Put it from the bottom. I don't even know how I'm doing. And you're talking about talking. Okay, hurry up. We're waiting on you. I'm feeling sick here. Keep that in mind. You keep asking what's wrong with me. There is no part of me that is healthy. My stomach hurts. I have a headache. I'm all broken up. So hurry up! Alright, alright. It's going slower than I hoped. And costing me more each day. You know the hostage we have ashore? Yeah Take him to Ali Noor, and see if he'll buy him from us. I need to recoup some of my costs. Plus the shipowners will be scared if we sell one of their men. Alright, Alright. Talk to you later. We should sell the hostage at the camp. No. We should just kill him. Scare them. Are you crazy? What do you mean you want to kill him? Don't you get it? This is our job. This is business. The hostages are the product. They have to be alive, do you understand? You've got to listen. Just take him to Ali Noor, and get me a good price. You brought a good one. Hey! Stand up straight. He's weird-looking. Don't move! Where was he born? He is American or French. I think French. You will calm down on your own soon enough So... let's talk about the price. Alright, you pay me $50,000 and he's all yours. Are you crazy? $50,000... $50,000 is a fair price. This man isn't worth $50,000. I have $20,000 for you. Ok? I hijacked an entire fucking ship! I have to guard these hostages. I have to feed them. Do you know how much this costs me? Chewing a lot of khat. I have lots of expenses. I have to guard my hostages constantly. I have to feed everyone. You think this doesn't cost money? So take your $20,000 and I'll take the risk for this guy. We hijacked an entire ship. No deal. Can you make a deal for $25,000? We'll think about it. How about $30,000? Thanks, but no thanks. My father was a good man. A wise man. Bless his soul. He tried to pass that onto me. Teaching me to be brave. If he saw me today, what would he say? You... me... jail. What do you have for us? What have you brought? You show up with nothing. What have you done, what have you brought us? Why do you keep saying the ship is worthless? I'll tell you why. Because this wreck doesn't have any cargo, and the shipowner doesn't have insurance. He'll never pay what we asked. This whole operation is costing me too much. I pay for guards around the clock. I pay for all this food, all this khat, all the gas, the bullets in your gun, everything. We couldn't even sell a hostage. What could I do? I took their offer. They'll pay us next week as long as the hostages are still alive. Calm yourselves. Let me tell you something, I don't care about having supplies! I want my money. Everyone in here wants their riches. If they don't give us the money this week, I'll finish him off like an animal. I don't need this dumb foreigner. I just want my money! How much money are they bringing? Is it still two million? No, no, no, no it's one million. One million is nothing after you take your share. What about the rest of us? That's not bad money for a wreck of a ship like this. Okay, if that's all we can get, then take it. Bottle cap. Bottle cap. In Somali, bottle cap. Pawn. Pawn. Your French is good. Hey! There's a plane, do you see it? A plane is coming! A plane is coming! A plane! A plane, man! The plane is there. There it is! Grab a hold of him! They're after us! Listen man, these Americans have planes they send. You can't see them and you can't hear them. Every minute they are in the air. And everywhere you go, they are with you. They can see you. And you can't watch for them, you can't see them. You can look for it all you want. But you'll never see it. It's invisible. They're looking for us. We're not safe at this camp. Ok, you're just going to show up? Let me know before you come. Why? You're just sitting here chewing khat while planes hover above us out there. We're in danger. And you're just sitting here. Let you know? Friend, calm down, calm down. These planes that you see are checking to see if their people are still alive. They don't want trouble. You understand? Don't you see the planes hovering above? The whole camp is in danger. Calm down, calm down. There's no trouble. From now on let me know before you come here. How can you say there is no trouble? Why should I calm down, why? There are planes circling around us. Some are invisible, you can't see them! There are bad spirits around us. What are you talking about? Hey crazy boy, your elders are talking here, and you're just going to walk in? Are you crazy? Leave us alone. Leave us, leave us alone. Get back to work. Walk away! Who is this? My name isn't Idil, what do you want? I don't know who this is, put my wife on. What do you mean more money? I've already paid. I've already paid. Your wife is the pretty one with the kid. No, he's not your son until you pay me. That's my son. I've already paid. My time is precious, I won't wait much longer for my money. Listen... listen to me. This wasn't the deal. You know what happens to pretty girls when they don't pay. This guy, Khadir, he is scum. I don't want him to lead us anymore. What would be better for me is to get out from under him and take control of our lives. The way I see it is that the man is torn as well, the problems he has are the same as ours. What we should do first off is calm down and remember we are kin, focus on what we can gain and toss these issues aside. Listen friend, don't turn a cheek to this. That guy is out of his mind! I've told you, that man is scum! The hostages on that ship belong to us too, right? Who is Khadir to treat us like children? That's what I'm trying to tell you! I tried to warn him of the planes, but he wants to treat us like dogs! I won't allow it! I'll take what I want! What is this guy saying? Did he call? Man, he didn't call anyone! Who does he think we are? Call! Fucking Pig! Call them! This asshole has nothing to say! Get inside! Go! Sit, motherfucker! Are you following what he said? It's possible that when we handed him the phone he called the wrong number. No, what concerns me is how those two in there act like friends. They're planning something. Get out of here. Go fuck yourself. Go on, move. Bitch. What's going on between you two? I need to get out of here. I need to leave here and find my wife. You want to escape with the white man and run off with our money? That's what you want? What are you talking about? I need to go help my wife! Give me that gun! Search him! Search! What is this man? What is this? You trying to blow us up? I know what this is... it's a satellite phone. You use this to contact the drones. I just use it to call my wife, take it if you want! Listen to me! From here on out, you stay right here. You hear me? I'm on your side! Ok, I understand! If you see him talking to the hostage again, you know what to do. I'm going to tell you a sweet story. There once was a lion. The lion lost his family. He was tired, hungry, and all alone. But after he searched for a long time, the lion found his family. And he was happy again. Okay sweetie? He was very happy. Yeah, let's do it. Take a hit, my friend. Hit it! Be careful. It's strong stuff. Not diluted. Let it hit you, let it hit you. So, how are you? Are you not well? Hey! Do you want some khat? You want to get high? Let me give you some khat, look. Everyone is getting high. Aren't you happy here like this? Just eating, drinking, sleeping... its good for you, right? It isn't good for you? Why don't you chew khat? Chew some with the men. Do you believe in God?! Do you believe in God?! Hey! I said, do you believe in God?! Do you believe in God?! What? Do you believe in God?! Every night you just drink and sleep, drink and sleep... Do you believe in God? Sit down! Sit down! Calm yourself! Hey! Bring Abdi! Bring him! Sit right here! Bring him! Sit here! Say the Shahada for him! Make the man a Muslim. Make him a Muslim! Say the Shahada for him! Make him a Muslim! I bear witness... Say the Shahada! I bear witness that there is no God but God 'Allah, ' and I bear witness... and I bear witness that Mohammed is his messenger. Peace be upon him. What's going on here you fools? This man is our money! What are you doing here? What are you idiots doing? Where are you going to get money? What have you been doing here? What did you do? What mission are you on? Tell me! Talk to me! What do you mean by this? Take their guns. You think this is your job? This is our money! This is how you're carrying on? Pick him up. Take this man with us. Take him! Take him with us. You're ignorant. I can't even look at you. Tomorrow is the day we've waited for. Pay attention, this is serious money. They will be expecting you to go upstairs and raise these two flags. Flags Bravo and Mike. If you don't fly these two flags, then the plane will not drop the money. We won't get the money. You will not get the money. You understand? These two flags? You'll need to sail out to international waters to meet them, so bring some skiffs on board You'll need them to retrieve the money and head back to land Once you've got the money... make sure to count it thoroughly. If the money is all there, release the people and leave the ship. You can count on me. You understand? Perfectly. Don't you worry. Where will you go? What are you gonna do with the money? Hey, let me take a look. You look like a wet cat. What do you think you're doing? Well? The money is coming! What is this shit? You're trying to cut me out. No other man will eat my stock. What are you doing? The money is coming today! My stock will not be eaten by another man. If the Americans find us I swear I won't just kill you, I will slaughter you all! Now sail fast! You're a lion, China boy. A lion. One of a kind. God never made a lion like you before. You know what motherfucker? That sweet life you had... living in your beautiful house and your fancy bed... you think you're going back to that? Wake up, friend. Now you're living the life we live. Enjoy it. You're my cow, do you know that? And you have lots of milk. We're going to milk you dry. We're going to drink it all. And your milk... it's going to taste so sweet. Hey, what do you think you're doing? What do you want from him? What do you think you're doing? What do you want from him? This man is our ticket out. What are you doing? You've never killed a chicken! Shoot! I will, I'll shoot! You've never killed a bird in your life. Move boy, move. Open the door! You're gonna die in there! Open the door! I'm a lion. I'll fucking eat you up. There it is. It's going to drop the money. Is it leaving? Can you see it? What's going on? What's happening? It's turning away! What happened? Did the plane leave? Maybe it's coming back? What's happening? What's happening? I told you! Khadir was a liar! I told you! You see what he's done! Do you see! He betrayed us! It's gone. I'm going to kill somebody! Lets go! Lets go motherfuckers! Get the hostages! We're going back to shore! Walk! Motherfuckers! We're leaving! Back to shore! Let's go! Stay here. Don't move. Don't be stupid. They'll kill us. It's all for show. Each time. They're the ones who need us. Don't listen to them. You idiot. You want to go? Go. I'm not going. You don't get it. You're scared. You're not thinking straight. Don't be stupid, Victor. I'm begging you, let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Open up! I was blessed with a wife and a son. I was blessed with a good heart. What have I done with these blessings? Have I earned this fate with my own hands? God forgive him. God have mercy on him. Accept him into Heaven.
