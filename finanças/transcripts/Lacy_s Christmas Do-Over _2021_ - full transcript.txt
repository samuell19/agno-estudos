Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la, la la la la 'Tis the season to be jolly This Christmas, give the gift of love from Lynn D. Jewelers. Lynn D. Jewelers, providing fine jewelry... It's not even Halloween yet. That's Lacy. She needs to find her Christmas spirit. It's been gone for a long, long time. She was always on the nice list and she truly loved Christmas, but like so many, things happen in life that cause you to follow another path. Unfortunately, for this poor girl, hers happened at Christmas. She needs a good dose of Christmas magic and maybe a few do-overs to get things right. What time are you gonna be there? I need to get in before Nora arrives. She has something important she wants to speak with me about. Which, between you and me, I think she's going to finally promote me to partner. I'm there in five minutes, Lacy. I'll have everything set up for you and your big day. I can get you that new peppermint Christmas latte instead of your regular. You know I don't want any of that sweet holiday garbage. I just want my regular daily fix, and I'm definitely gonna need it to get through today. I hate one-on-ones, I hate surprises, and most importantly, you know I hate them at the holidays. I'm just teasing you, Lacy. Just get in here and focus on becoming partner. I already have your iced half-caff ristretto, Venti, four-pump sugar-free cinnamon dulce, soy, skinny latte ready for you. See you shortly. Or as I like to call it, the Ice Queen's Happy Juice. Mm, funny, funny, Raymond. You'll definitely get a job as a comedian if this whole interior design career doesn't take off for you. Enjoy your drink while you can, because Nora's already in the conference room waiting for you. Surprise. One, two... Why didn't you tell me that to begin with? You know I hate surprises! Did she get here before you? Lacy, please, no one gets here before me. Look, for five years we've worked together. You are a talented, brilliant woman. You've worked your butt off to get here, and it's your time now. So finish your breathing exercises, take your drink, and go get what you deserve. - Good morning, Lacy. - Good morning. - Oh, I so love the holidays. - Oh. This time of year is just magical. - Hmm. - Definitely the best time to be in our line of work. Oh, yes, it's such a jolly good time. If you're into that sort of thing. Get over yourself, my dear. You will find yourself appreciating "that sort of thing" some day. If anything, you should appreciate how high your sales have been this season. You are the star of our company. And, Lacy, you have a remarkable following with our clients. We just landed two very large accounts. Oh, this holiday is going to be spectacular. What is that knocking? Ah, moving on. This office is going to be so busy that we all need to keep a positive holiday energy. Heading into this holiday season, Lacy, we can't afford any more of your negativity, and especially outbursts. So because of all of this, I want you to have a change about your Christmas attitude. Hm? Maybe try to have a smidge of fun this holiday? So that is why I am bringing in someone to help. What? No, Nora, that is... There is no need for that. I have been doing this for so long by myself, I couldn't possibly work with anyone else. This has nothing to do with the holidays. Where is this coming from? I've been working on this. I'm not difficult. I mean, I've been going to a therapist. I'm more mindful. I just have some issues with the holidays. Lacy, my niece just graduated from the New York School of Interior Design, and I want you to mentor her. Lacy, I once mentored you and look what became of you. I hope you do the same for my niece. I'm not asking you, Lacy. And where am I supposed to find this lovely and talented, perfect Christmas gift? Oh, she's right behind you. Lacy, meet my niece, Jenna. Nice to meet you, Lacy. I'm such a huge fan of all your designs. I grew up admiring all your work. My Aunt Nora always tells me I remind her of you. I used so many of your past designs as inspiration while I was at school. I like to think my designs reflect yours, just a little freshened up. I'm sure you'll teach me so many things. Okay! She seems nice. What the hell just happened in there? I-I was ambushed. "Freshened up." Did she really just say that to me? What a condescending little snot. I thought I was going in there for a promotion that I have been working so hard for. And now I'm stuck babysitting some spoiled little rich kid? And who is Nora to tell me that I'm stressed out? And I have a temper, really? I do not have a temper. - Tell me I don't have a temper! - What temper? I've only ducked a couple staplers these past few years. Keep doing your breathing. I don't hear you counting. One, two, three, uh-huh, yeah, breathe. Now, seriously, an extra set of hands with all this work could be good for us. Why don't you take some time for yourself? Balance the work. Even try to enjoy the holiday. You know, sing a carol, indulge in some eggnog... maybe even a little holiday romance. Maybe not. But, look, let's just give Jenna a chance. I'm just saying, how bad could she be? Yay! Where you going? Are these your designs for the new Underhill account? Wow! You have outdone yourself again. I know you couldn't do it without me. - Okay. - Just sayin'. Look, these guys are brand new, and they came to us so highly recommended. I did a little extra work and the deadline isn't till tomorrow. No stress, no outbursts. We are ahead on all accounts, and this is the first deadline tomorrow. Nora will be beyond impressed. And you, you have been very good with Jenna, who surprisingly has been pretty helpful, wouldn't you say? She's entirely too bubbly for my liking, but yes, she has been more helpful than not. And speak of the devil. I hope I'm not interrupting. I wanted to let you guys know that there are candy cane cupcakes that I made in the breakroom. Better get in there quick, though, 'cause they're going fast. I think I saw Darryl eat three. Darryl, all he does is crunches numbers and eats. You know, Lacy loves candy canes. Yeah, I'll go get us some. Peppermint's her favorite. Be nice. I want to thank you for being so nice to me, Lacy. I'm watching you, absorbing everything you say and do, like I'm a big sponge. Oh, I'm such a dork for saying that. Are those the new designs for the Underhill account? - Mm-hmm. - May I? Lacy, these are fabulous. I've never seen anything like this. You have to let me take you out so I can pick your brain. I know the perfect place that has a Christmas martini with a peppermint twist. It's perfect because you love peppermint so much. I wanna know everything about you, where you studied, what your inspirations are. I wanna know who the real Lacy is. That's great, Jenna. I have to go find Raymond. He can set it up, but just for now, stay focused, as the Underhills are not our only account. Too bad the Underhills are the only account that matters. This firm's legacy is mine... not yours, Lacy. Merry Christmas, everybody. I want to thank you for working so hard. We are getting close to the holiday break, and we are breaking records this year. I want to congratulate my niece and newest member of our office for outstanding performance in just the first two weeks. I received a call this morning from Mr. James Underhill himself. He was so blown away by the designs my niece Jenna did that he wants her and only her to handle their account. Breathe. Oh, shoot. Those designs are mine, you-you elf witch! I knew I couldn't trust you! You have no idea how to do those designs! You've never even spoken to the Underhills! You can hardly handle speaking on the phone with your bubbly attitude and your stupid holiday spirit! You are more concerned with passing out candy canes than coming up with any real ideas! Well, you can take those candy canes - and shove them... - Lacy, what are you doing? Lacy, that is enough! Jenna? She's absolutely insane. Of course those are my ideas. You've told me how unhinged she can become, this whole office knows. Not only did I come up with those ideas, but I tried to do it while providing this office with some much-needed holiday spirit. It's like, not being an old scrooge for the holidays. Old scrooge? Oh, I'm gonna rip those elf ears off your smug little head! Now, enough everyone! Lacy, that is it! You need to get a hold of yourself, and try to learn to embrace the Christmas spirit. I don't want to see you back in this office until the new year. - That's final. - Nora... And if anyone else has anything to say, they can leave, too. But you won't have the luxury of coming back in the new year. Happy holidays. Excuse me. Lacy, why are you packing all this up? You'll be back before you know it. I highly doubt it, Raymond. Don't you see the bigger picture here? Jenna has been out for my job all along. You've been my best friend for more than five years now. I care about you more than an associate should. This is about you. No one else. Think about it. Who gets angry during the holidays? You need to take this week and figure out how to fix you. You are a beautiful, intelligent woman who has no one in her life but her dashing assistant. It's time for you to learn to relax, love, and embrace the holidays. On that note, I've scheduled you an appointment tonight with Dr. Noelles. Who the heck is that? Dr. Baker is on vacation and his office suggested him. And no buts, just go. It's time for you to work on you. Merry Christmas. No grumbling. Mm-hmm. Mm-mmm. Thank you, girl. I want to thank you for seeing me, Dr. Noelles. I-I didn't realize Dr. Baker was out of town for the holidays, and I really needed to speak with somebody. I can't believe what happened. Everything was going so great until that little demon arrived. And Nora just allowed her to sabotage me, and everyone at the office adores her. Why do bad things always happen to me during the holidays? Well, Lacy, I do see that you have anger issues that come from an unresolved occurrence that happened during the holiday season. It doesn't have anything to do with any unresolved occurrence. It's this little Elf on the Shelf, just showed up and sabotaged me, and I'm supposed to sit back and let it happen? No way. It doesn't have anything to do with my past. Lacy, you've come to me for a reason. You've become sarcastic and angry during the holidays for many years now, but your temper has nothing to do with the holiday season. Lacy, you only have one life to live. I believe that you need to get out of this city which has made you so hard. You need to look at the big picture in your life, Lacy, and find what is truly missing. - Where would I go? - Funny you should ask. It's a quaint little B&B run by the Maguires in the town of Oregon, Illinois. I have a room reserved for you for a week. Go, spend Christmas there. It's an enchanting place. I promise you will find the answers to all you are looking for. Maybe even a little surprise. Doctor? Doctor? I can't believe this. I'm lost in the middle of nowhere in a whiteout. Where is this place? Where did that storm go? Oh, thank you very much. Where were you when the storm was happening? Lacy, you need to be around people now. Welcome, welcome. You must be Lacy. Dear, you look so cold. Can I get you some eggnog to warm you up? - A little toot never hurts anyone. - Hi, hello. No, that's not necessary. I'm actually exhausted from the long drive. That's a good idea, Marce. Get us all a drink, and then we can come and bring our guest down here to sit and we'll get to know our visitor. After all, we promised Dr. Noelles we'd take good care of you. We are so lucky Dr. Noelles sent you here. You're our only guest for the week. We usually are a packed house at Christmas. Oh, I appreciate your hospitality. If I could just see my room. Oh, I hope you like the holidays. After all, Oregon's known for its Christmas spectacular. We have so many things scheduled every day until Christmas, and, hey, Marcy here, she's a wonderful cook. Especially her fruitcake. Do you like fruitcake, Lacy? Oh, Hank, stop teasing the poor girl. She looks tired from the drive. Why don't we show her the room so she can get some shut-eye? You can take your drink with you. That's a good idea, Mar. We do get up early in these parts. Early? Yes, the room is a good idea. Thank you both for being so welcoming. Now, uh, bathroom's private, but it's at the end of the hall. Kitchen's downstairs in case you want anything, however, we do all the cooking. Oh, and, uh, breakfast, it's when the rooster crows. We're gonna let you be. Come on, Hank, let's go. We're gonna turn in ourselves. We got a big day tomorrow. Have a good night. Jingle, jingle! Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa, la, la, la Very Christmassy. Are you smiling at me? Creepy little elf. Great. I'm talking to myself again. Wonder what's in this drink. You've got to be kidding me. Could someone shut that darn bird up?! Where's my phone? I need to call Raymond. I just had it, where could it be? Oh, please, please, please, please. Please don't be broken. Call Raymond. Call Raymond! I could've sworn I turned you around last night. Creepy little elf. I need a hot shower, my latte, and a working cell tower. There's gotta be one somewhere in this hick town. Oh, good morning, Lacy. How did you sleep? I hope the room was to your liking. Marcy, the room was fine, if not for the crowing that woke me up, but the shower had no hot water. I froze my bottom off. Hank, are we having hot water problems? No, the water's working just fine. Ice storm knocked out the cell towers, though, and the landlines are down, too. Well, the chief will be by in a little while. He'll let us know what's what. He always comes by for a slice of Marcy's fruitcake. Hey, you should take that plate and fill it up with some of this fine spread. I think I'm just gonna grab a latte in town and try and find some phone reception. I'm sure my office is trying to get a hold of me. Oh, I'm sure they are, dear. Listen, this'll be here every morning for you, so why don't you try and relax and enjoy it? Thanks, but I don't think I'll be staying long. This may have been a mistake for me. I-I do appreciate you both, but I think all of this is just a bit too festive for me. Being festive is what Oregon's all about. You shouldn't miss the Christmas festival. Oh, the festival is where I found my true love. Jingle, jingle, Lacy! It's time to get in your car and get your job back, Lacy. No phone, no hot water, this place stinks. Come on! What the...? Come on! Everything all right here, young lady? I need to get out of here and my car won't start. Now why would you wanna get out of this fine establishment so quickly? The Maguires are some of the finest people I know, Lacy. I'm sorry, do I know you? News travels fast in this here town. I'm the chief of police. I make it a point to know who's coming into my town. Kind of like the welcome wagon, so... welcome. Great, uh, Chief...? Melville, but you can call me Brody. Great, Brody. Um, any way you could use your CB thinga-majigy or walkie-talkie to call me a mechanic? You're in luck. In a town this small, I'm not only chief of police, I'm the mechanic, too. Please, pop your hood. Well, Lacy, you want the good news or the bad news? The way my life's been going, just hit me with the bad news first. Your alternator's kaput. I can fix it, but we need to order the part first. How long is that gonna take? Being it's so close to Christmas, if we order it now, probably not more than a few days. I'll call Deputy Donner to bring the tow truck. - Thanks, Sheriff. Thanks, Chief. - Mm. Mm. Why don't you give me the good news? Well, now... you get to join me inside for a slice of Marcy Maguire's famous fruitcake. Well, you didn't get very far, Lacy. Oh, Brody, how 'bout a cup of coffee and some fruitcake? What happened? - My car died. - We'll get it fixed. She just needs a new part. I'll order it after I have my fruitcake. Lacy, what can we do to cheer you up? I just need to get to town. I need to check in with my office, my friends. That'd be Raymond, but I need to let them know I got here safely. Even if you get into town, I don't think you'll have any luck with the phones. Maybe I can get an email out? I mean, how are you gonna order the part? I'll order it after the phones are back in service, obviously. Lacy, if you need to get to town, I'm sure Jakey can take you. Of course, that's a great idea, Marcy. He'll be back any minute. Great. Is he the town's mayor who just also happens to be the town's taxi? Hey, there. Welcome to the Pinehill B&B. I see you met Mom and Dad, but they didn't tell me about you. Lacy, this is our son Jakey. He's headed to town to pick up some Christmas lights. He runs our Christmas tree farm. Jakey, maybe you could take her to town with you? I'd really appreciate a ride to town, Jakey. It's not a problem, provided you love the smell of Christmas trees because the truck is covered in pine needles. Oh, I love the smell of pine needles. I just really need to get to town. Alrighty. Giddy up. Oh, don't forget to pick up the Christmas wreaths. Hey, you gonna bring back our special package with you? Sure thing, Pop. Oh, good. That was quick. Thanks. So, you in a goth band? I dress chic, unlike you, the poster boy for Carhartt. Okay. Well, what brings you to town, Elvira? I was told that to get into the Christmas spirit, I should come here. I wanted to leave, but my car broke down, and no phone reception, so... Well, I've already been there. No cell service, but I can definitely try to get you into the Christmas spirit. I'd like that, Jakey. Is that what I should call you? Or do you prefer Jake? I prefer Jake. Sounds more chic, right? Anyway, we're here. Stop it! Oh, hi there, Jakey. Where you been hiding yourself? At the Christmas tree farm, Rosie. Where I always am this time of year. And who do we have here? I've not seen you before. And I know everyone. I'm Lacy. I'm looking for a phone or internet connection. You're not gonna find that anywhere, hon. Not after that ice storm. Listen, hon, why don't I make you some of my nice, delicious Christmas glug and a slice of homemade pumpkin pie? Oh, I shouldn't. And I don't know what glug is. Oh, it's a bit of a warm Christmas cocktail. You should try some, but I'll warn you, too much will knock your socks off. - It's too early for a drink. - It's five o'clock somewhere. Hm-hm. Lacy, what have you got to do? Come on, I'll get you one. Let's get to know each other a little better. Come here. I'll be back to pick you up in a few. You two ladies, be nice. Especially you, Dot. Hm? He's right. You'll see. You see, Lacy, glug is like truth serum. One sip and you'll be crowin' like a rooster. Cock-a-doodle-doo! - All right. - Cheers. So how did you land the most eligible bachelor in town? Stop, I had no idea he was eligible or a bachelor. I just hitched a ride with him to get to town. I have to get back to my life in Chicago. There are people there depending on me. Raymond is depending on me. I'm sure he's trying to get a hold of me. Well, I don't know who this Raymond is, but Jakey is a fine catch. And we both saw the way you two were lookin' at each other. All the girls in this little town - would love to be in your place. - Mm-hm. Especially me. I wasn't looking at him in any way. I just met him. We definitely have nothing in common. Oh, I second that, based on the way you dress. - Okay! - What is with my clothes? This is very city chic. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, out here we dress Christmas chic. Christmas chic! Now, Lacy, Christmas is full of surprises, and Jake can be your Christmas surprise. I wish he was my Christmas surprise. Wrapped up in a big red bow. It's happenin' for you. - You are so bad, I'm tellin' you! - No! No! She... If you hang around her too long... No, it didn't happen like that. - Yes, it did. - Well, I see you all enjoyed the glug, especially you, Dot. Shh! All right, I hate to break this soiree up, but I gotta get some stuff back to the inn. Well, tell your mom I hope she enjoyed the pumpkin pie I sent over - and tell her to join us next time! - All right, you got it. Oh! And, Lacy, enjoy your Christmas surprise! Ooh! Oh, my goodness. Miss? Hold your horses! Can't you see we're busy over here? Careful. You must be Lacy. Do you like fish? What-what do you mean, do I like fish? I've been ice fishing all day. This is the biggest one I caught. Jake, this is the cutest little boy. He just told me he's been fishing all day. Little boy? Little boy?! How rude are you? I'm a ten-year-old girl! You just probably haven't ever seen a girl with a fish like this. Well, maybe where I'm from, little girls don't fish. Out here, little girls do fish, Lacy. Meet my daughter, Faith. Daughter? Merry Christmas, Lacy. This is what you get for calling me a boy. - Jingle, jingle! - Jingle, jingle! - Ooh! - Come here, you! - Oh, how you doin'? - Good, good. - Did you have a fun time today? - I did. - Oh, catch a lot of fish? - I did. Just like your grandpa. Lacy... a little bird told me you had some glug today. How did you like it? Ooh, some of my eggnog would be perfect for happy hour. I could really use that right about now. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la, la la la la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la, la la la la You've got to be kidding me. That bird again? Could someone shut that darn bird up? Where's my phone? I need to call Raymond. I just had it, where could it be? Oh, please, not again. Okay, little man. Let's let Mrs. Maguire turn you around this time. At least my fuzzies are dry. Please, God, let there be hot water. Marcy's workin' overtime. Oh, good morning, Lacy. How did you sleep? I hope the room was to your liking. Marcy, the shower had no hot water again. Hank, are we having hot water problems? No, the water's working fine. Ice storm knocked down the cell tower, though, and the landlines are down, too. Well, the chief will be by in a little while. He'll let us know what's what. He always comes by for a slice of Marcy's fruitcake in the morning. Hey, you should take that plate and fill it up with some of this fine spread. I need to go to my car. I'm sure my office is trying to get a hold of me by now. I'm sure they are, dear. Listen, this spread'll be here every morning, so why don't you try to relax and enjoy it? Hey, have a great day. Yeah, Hank, you told me that yesterday. It's back. My car's back. Everything okay here, young lady? Are you kidding? You were supposed to fix my car. Now why would you wanna get out of this fine establishment so quickly? The Maguires are some of the finest people I know, Lacy. Chief, I met you yesterday. News travels fast in this here town. Now, I'm the chief of police. I make it a point to know who's coming into my town. I'm kind of like the welcome wagon, so... welcome. What is going on? Chief Melville, but you can call me Brody. Okay, now this is really too bizarre. What is happening? You're in luck. In a town this small, I'm not only chief of police, I'm the mechanic, too. Please, pop your hood. Well, Lacy, you want the good news or the bad news? Forget it, let's just go inside and get your fruitcake. Your alternator's kaput. Okay, the good news. Well, now... you get to join me inside for a slice of Marcy Maguire's famous fruitcake. Well, you didn't get very far, Lacy. Brody, how about a cup of coffee and some fruitcake? - What happened? - I'm going insane. We'll get it fixed. She just needs a new part. I'll order it after I have my fruitcake. Lacy, what can we do to cheer you up? I need to get to town. I need to get in touch with my office. Even if you get into town, I don't think you'll have any luck with the phones. You already told me that, Brody. How are we gonna order the new part? Well, I'll order it after the phones are back in service, obviously. Lacy, if you need to get to town, I'm sure Jakey can take you. Of course, that's a great idea, Marcy. He'll be back any minute. When does he get here? Hi there. Welcome to the Pinehill B&B. I see you met Mom and Dad, but they didn't tell me about you. Lacy, this is our son Jakey. He's headed to town to pick up some Christmas lights. He runs our Christmas tree farm. Jakey, maybe you could take her to town with you? I really need a ride in your truck, Jakey. It's not a problem, provided you love the smell of Christmas trees because the truck is covered in pine needles. - Oh, definitely. Let's just go. - Giddy up. Oh, don't forget to pick up the Christmas wreaths. Hey, you gonna bring back our special package with you? Sure thing, Pop. So, you in a goth band? No. Are you the town comedian? Ouch. I'm just having fun with you, Morticia. So where are we going today, Jakey? First of all, I prefer Jake. Secondly, I'm headed to my Christmas tree farm. If you're trying to get in the Christmas spirit, it's a magical place. I've never seen anything magical, Jakey, and I'm really not one for the holidays. All right, well, I'll bet you one of my mom's fruitcakes that you'll agree with me. I don't eat fruitcake, but I'll take that bet. Alrighty. Giddy up. So this is where you sell the trees from? This place is pretty big to just be supplying for Oregon. Oh, we're actually the major supplier for the entire Northwest region. Every Christmas, we send the trees out about a month before. Ones that are for next year are over there. Those are the leftovers from this year. And about a mile that way... you'll find the ones for ten years from now. You know, we've gotta protect our ecosystem. I never get tired of this view. Especially at this time of year. Yeah, this is... this is pretty impressive. Well, if we head this way, I can show you the barn. I bet you say that to all the girls, Jakey. No, no girls, Lacy, not for a while now. Don, I need your help. I got stuck. Faith, that is a two-person saw. How'd you get it that far in there? She's short, but she's strong. Oh, howdy, Jake. You gonna introduce us to your friend there? Don, this is Lacy. Otherwise known as Cruella de Vil. She makes Cruella look nice. Okay. Enough with the clothes jokes, cowboy. Let's call a truce. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Lacy. And don't listen to them. I think you look fine. Might even be the prettiest girl in town now. Hey, miss, have you ever used a two-person saw before? I bet you haven't. I bet you haven't cut anything other than using scissors. Faith, Lacy's probably never done anything like this. She probably doesn't wanna get dirty, either. Yeah, she definitely doesn't wanna get those spiffy clothes dirty. I'm not afraid of getting dirty. Of course I've sawed before. Gimme the saw. Faith, what were you thinking? You could have seriously hurt someone. It's okay. I'm-I'm fine. Really, it's-it's all good. I'm okay. Kids... you can't live with 'em and you can't sell 'em. She's a feisty one, isn't she? You have any kids, Don? Who, me? Kids? No! I'm the town's MEB, most eligible bachelor. But, uh, no one's got me yet. Let's talk about what's really on your mind. You mean Jake? Okay. What's his story? Oh, Jake's the best guy in town. He treats everybody like they're family. But that poor guy... Life has put him through the ringer. He had Faith and got married right after high school. He moved from Oregon to Chicago. They had a nice little house in the suburbs, and they were very happy. Until... one snowy night, his wife, Amanda... she was killed by a drunk driver. His whole world was shattered. So he brought his baby back home to Oregon, and it's been him and Faith and the whole town ever since. He's a good dad and a good man. And we all treat his daughter as if she's our own, and, you know, naturally that might be why Faith has a little bit of an issue with you. She's feisty, but she's just trying to protect her dad. But the one thing that little girl needs most is a mom. Wow, I had no idea. That's terrible. Hey, um... I don't know if you're up for it, but let's take a walk. Faith's gonna stay in there for a little while just to collect her thoughts, and she'll be out to apologize soon enough. She does not need to apologize to me. That was some good competition. I needed that. I haven't done a double saw in forever. Ah, you looked like a pro out there, Lacy. Yeah, I'll be sure to tell my bruises that. I want to thank you for being so nice to me. This time of the year isn't usually so festive. Yeah, well, I wanna apologize to you about Faith. She can get like this with new ladies around. Are there new ladies around often? No, not really. In this town, it's usually tourists, and that's not anything I'm looking for anyway. So she can have her fun with them. It's, uh... it's especially hard for her around the holidays. Yeah, Don told me what happened to you guys. I'm so sorry. Must be really hard for you, too. Look, uh, when I said that there were no new girls, I meant it. I was very lucky to have an extremely special relationship that brought me the joy of my life. Now I just focus on being a good dad and a better person. Maybe that's it for me. I know it sounds cheesy, but... it works for us. Don says that you're the best guy in town, so I think you're doin' pretty good. Yeah. Thanks. But I'm sure you noticed that Faith is a little rough around the edges. I'm sure she picks that up from her number one role model being her daddy. So what about you? What brings a city gal like yourself out to Oregon, lllinois? Well, I was told I was overworked and unpleasant to be around, so I was actually sent here, as Oregon is the place to get into the Christmas spirit. You know, I really didn't think I was gonna enjoy it over here, but I have to admit, I'm having a really nice time. I can see why you like it so much. The trees are beautiful. Each one's like a work of art. That's my designer eye speaking. Well, don't go wearing flannel on me now. Ah, I would not be caught dead in one. Okay, okay. I think you could pull it off. We'll get you a blinking light sweater, some reindeer ears, and a cute little elf costume. Here, have a peppermint cupcake! Well, now, see how happy you look? I told you these trees are magical. Especially this one. This is the pride and joy of Pinehill Farms. Magic, huh? Maybe you can find some way to try and convince me. I think I might know how to do that. Oh, Dad... You're showing your magic Christmas tree. Sorry to interrupt. I just had to apologize. Oh, you don't have to apologize to me, Faith. We were just having a friendly competition, right? You're right. But I still wanna say I'm sorry, Lacy. You look like you need to be more in the Christmas spirit. So I figured an early Christmas gift would be nice. Good work, Girdy. I hate that rooster! Take that, you stupid bird! I hate the wind, too. All right, where is my phone? I need to call Raymond. I just had it, where could it be? Hey, rooster! Hope you're hungry! Oh, good morning, Lacy. How did you sleep? I hope the room was to your liking. Marcy, ask Hank about the hot water. Hank, are we having hot water problems? No, the water's working fine. Ice storm knocked down the cell towers... I know about the ice storm, Hank. I need to go to my car. Ha! I'm going insane. This is not possible. How can it be the same day? Everything okay here, young lady? Okay, Brody. Why is my car still sitting here when I need to get out of this place? Now why would you wanna get out of a fine establishment like this so quickly? The Maguires are some of the finest people I know, Lacy. You're the chief, the mechanic, the town's welcome wagon, yada, yada, yada. Just go inside and get your fruitcake. News travels fast in this here town. I'm the chief of police. I make it a point to note who's coming into my town. I'm kind of like the welcome wagon, so... welcome! Great, Chief. Don't worry, I'll call you Brody. Hi there. Welcome to the Pinehill B&B. Jakey, I need to get out of here, so just take me wherever you're going today. Okay, I'm game. But you just gotta answer me one question. Oh, don't say it. Goth? Beatnik? Oh, no, you're a Cure fan. No, no, no, no. You were headed to a poetry slam festival, took a wrong turn, and ended up in Christmas town. Don't you ever listen to a different song? Well, I'm not picky and besides, it's the holidays so any Christmas song is fine with me. Okay, explain that! That's a pretty good coincidence, considering the fact the town has one radio station and all the buttons are programmed to it. Where are you going today, Jakey? I'm just headed to the town square. Gotta pick up my special little package. - You mean Faith. - Yeah, that is who I'm going to pick up. We've got a whole day planned. You're welcome to join us. Oh, I will definitely join you. That little package is just full of surprises, isn't she? It's about time Faith gets a surprise. Great. You're gonna love Faith. La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la Hey, it's Jake! Oh, hey. Sorry, I was aiming for my dad. Let's call a truce and get these boys! All right, Lacy. - Yeah! - Get 'em, Faith! No! All right, all right, cease fire, cease fire. Ooh! All right, come on. Let's get some hot chocolate, on me. Come on. - Alrighty. - All right, I need... - Just keep pouring 'em. - Alrighty. Here's one. I want the marshmallows in it. Marshmallows, all right. I can't believe you're actually having fun with me. It looks like you kinda like my dad. Um, well, he seems like a really nice guy. You know, your dad has a quality I've never seen in someone before. Does that bother you, Faith? Because I know how much you love your dad, and I would never wanna take that away from you. You see, Lacy, it's always just been me and my dad. The problem is I've seen ladies look at my dad... but he never looked at them the way he looks at you. And you don't like that, do you, Faith? Faith, I know you lost your mom when you were little. No one is ever going to replace her. I'm sure your mom was an amazing lady who loved both you and your daddy very much. And I'm sure she'd want you both to be happy. Don't you think? Yeah, I guess so. I just don't want anything to change. I like things the way they are. Funny thing about change, as scary as it can be sometimes, change can be a nice surprise. Have you ever been married, Lacy? Nope. Not yet. Almost, but it didn't work out. Were you sad when it didn't work out? I guess. Is that why you wear all black? What is it with you people and my black clothes? I just think it looks chic. Well, maybe a good change would be putting some color into your wardrobe. Okay, come on, you crazy girl. Let's go rescue your dad. We can see who can put the most whipped cream in their hot cocoa. Ooh, I love whipped cream! You're on. I'm going over with my friends. Hey, Lacy, if you want to know where there's mistletoe, it's over by the big Christmas wreath! Wow. You're amazing. She hasn't taken to anyone like that ever. Well, I was a snowball champion when I was little. - Really? - No. I don't think I've ever been in a snowball fight in my entire life. I was just trying to survive those kids. Well, you certainly held your own. They can be pretty rough. You guys really hit it off. She was actually smiling at you. She actually made fun of my clothes, too. Yeah, yeah. The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Clearly. She's a good girl, though. She's adorable. And I don't say that about... any kids. So, uh... what's your story, Lacy? Never married, no kids, always workin'. How'd a beautiful girl like yourself not get tied down? Tied down as in married, kids, or both? You tell me. Okay, here we go. Um, I was in a relationship for quite some time. Blake was his name. Both of us were always working. You know, we were successful and enjoying life, and making money and traveling together. It was just... It was so much fun, but I didn't realize how fast the time was going by. And I started to notice that Blake wanted more and that he was ready to take the next step. I was young and brash and completely immersed in my career. I told him that marriage and kids may not be what I wanted in the future. I'll never forget the look on his face when he walked out of the room. I never thought he would just up and leave, but he did. I came home from work Christmas Eve and he was gone. All he left was a note that said, "Lacy, I wanted to give you a fresh start Christmas Day." Well, that, uh, certainly makes things a little clearer for me. A broken heart on Christmas would... certainly taint the holidays for anyone. But I personally think that Blake is the one who made the mistake leaving you. I mean, you seem pretty happy now. And look how you connected with Faith. Maybe it's time we mend that old Grinchy heart of yours. And how do you expect to do that, Jakey? Well, I've got one or two old Christmas surprises up my sleeve. That's funny, the reason I was told to come here was for a Christmas surprise. Well, what a surprise. We're sitting under mistletoe. Yeah, I've been told the most unforgettable kisses happen under mistletoe. - La, la - La-la, la Out jumps good old Santa Claus Down through the chimney with lots of toys All for the little one's Christmas joys Ho, ho, ho Who wouldn't go? We should go find Faith. So, this is where the Christmas festival takes place. Yeah. I mean, they work all year just to set it up, and people come from far and wide just to see it. You basically can't come through the town without experiencing it. Well, I mean, that all sounds good, but I don't think I have anyone to go with. Well, uh... I think I can help with that. As long as you don't mind sharing me with another lady. Hey, you two, can we get something to eat? - Yes. - All right, come on. So, as I was saying, usually Faith and I make a day of it every year. But based on what I saw today, I don't think Faith would mind if you joined us tomorrow. So what do you say, Faith? I would be honored to join you and Faith tomorrow. I really want to spend the day with you tomorrow. The festival is so much fun. Now let's get some food. - Food. - Yes! She's so beautiful when she's sleeping. This is the only time that she's quiet. I bet. But you really are doing an amazing job with her. She's quite the smart young lady. So, uh, you looking forward to tomorrow? Yes, I really am. I think I might stick out like a sore thumb. Maybe I can borrow one of Faith's light-up Christmas necklaces? I'm sure she's got plenty to spare. If not, we'll just throw a big red bow on you and call it a day. Thank you for such a wonderful day today, Jake. It's been a long time since I felt anything good around the holidays. I opened up to you about... Look, you don't need to explain, Lacy. You know, I... I know we've all got a past, but it's what makes us who we are today. Believe me, life will throw you some curveballs, but it's what you make of 'em that counts. I'm not the same person I was ten years ago, and I doubt that you are, either. Does it seem weird that I'm only just now figuring out who I am and what I want my life to look like? I feel like I've been running away from change for so long that I've missed out on something that could have been extraordinary. Yeah, but change is scary. But, you know, if you don't embrace it, you'll never know what extraordinary journey you're missing out on. I've always believed that people come into and out of your life at different times and different reasons. As I've always said, you've just got to have a little faith. Faith. That's a good one. I do appreciate your point, though. And, honestly, I've never connected with a kid as much as I did with her today. Well, looks like we got you home. Well, you, my dear, I will see tomorrow. Mm-hmm. I'll be the one with the big red bow. I'm sure we can find you something a little less noticeable. Eh. Ah, I've gotta get you to try some of Rosie's glug. Hope you're ready to have fun tomorrow. I'm going insane. Now I know I'm going insane. Lacy, you've got to snap out of this. This can't be real. Christmastime is a time of love and forgiveness. Get over yourself, my dear. You will find yourself appreciating "that sort of thing" someday. It's time for you to work on you. The festival is where I found my true love. Lacy, enjoy your Christmas surprise. One thing that little girl needs most is a mom. You need to look at the big picture in your life, Lacy. That old bird is right on time. Ooh! lt's cold. Hmm, where is my phone? Nice catch. December 24th. Twenty-three missed calls. Lacy, it's Raymond. Call me back when you get this message. Just want to make sure you got there all right. Hey, there, bet you're not calling me back because you've met someone and finally enjoying the holidays. Who am I kiddin'? Just call me back. Lacy, it's Raymond, call me back. I really need to talk to you. Crazy stuff going on here at the office. Lacy, where are you? Call me back, it's urgent. Nora's asking for you. She is not happy. Okay, Nora told me I need to be keeping better tabs on you. I must not be doing my job. Well, I told her if she hadn't told you to beat it, she wouldn't be in this situation. Okay, I didn't actually say that, but she's looking for you. Hello, Lacy, it's Nora. If you can call me back as soon as possible, I'd like to discuss a few things with you. I'm at the office and I'll be about... Time to wake up. Cold shower, here I come. Marcy is really working overtime. Hot water. Yes! There is actually hot water! Well, hey, creepy little friend. Maybe you're a little cute. No, not quite. Oh, good morning, Lacy. How did you sleep? I hope the room was to your liking. Thanks, Marcy. Yeah, I got a good night's rest last night. The shower finally had hot water, it felt amazing this morning. Oh, Lacy, a fella by the name of Raymond called for you. Left a couple of messages, sounded quite urgent. Oh, he also said you would really enjoy this drink in the morning. We've never heard of an iced half-caff, four-pump, sugar-free, cinnamon skinny something or other. Sounds pretty fancy to me. Hank had to drive two towns over just to find a place that would make one for you. You gotta keep the guests happy, right, Marcy? It's Christmastime. Wow, thank you, Hank. I can't believe you would do that for me. Mmm... Oh, this hits the spot. I guess my office was worried about me since they haven't been able to get a hold of me - the past couple of days. - I'm sure they are, dear. Listen, this spread'll be here every morning, so why don't you just try and relax and enjoy it? It all looks delicious. To be honest, I woke up famished this morning. Must be all the fresh country air. Are you headed to the festival today, Lacy? I was planning on it since I heard it was the event of the year in this town. Maybe I'll get a few ideas for future projects. Only trouble is I don't think I have the right outfit for it. Well, maybe we can help you with that. Marcy's got so many of those Christmas sweaters around this house, I'm sure we can find something that'll suit you just fine. I know just the one, it'll fit you perfectly. Go, go, go. - Well, hello, folks. - Oh, Brody, come in. Just stopping in for my jet fuel and that delicious fruitcake. Who's ready for the big day today? Well, we were just talking about that. Uh, Marcy's helping Lacy here. She's gonna get out of those city clothes, finally. Well, good for you. We can't have you going into our festival wearing all black. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but you'll see. Here we dress what you city folk might call "Christmas chic." I've heard that from someone before. I brought your sporty little car back, Lacy. Ooh, she's fast. It's as good as new, though. Oh, um, great. Well, I thought you'd be thrilled. I mean, I worked overtime on it. You said you had to get back to the city. No, I-I do. You're right. Thank you, Brody. Lacy, your festival outfit awaits! Go, go, go! - Shall we? - Let's. Drumroll, please! I'm proud to present the honorary queen of the Oregon Festival! Well! Look at you. You're pretty enough to be on a Christmas card. Everything fit her perfectly. I still got it. Well, that sweater looks like it was made just for you. It really does fit perfectly. I hope it looks okay. Well, well, well. Look what we have here. Somebody's ready to hit the festival, wouldn't you say, Faith? You look pretty, Lacy. I want you to wear this. We can be matchers. Thanks, Faith. I don't think I've ever owned anything like this before. Do you think I'll fit in? I think you look perfect. I think red's your new black. You're still a big city gal to me, Lacy. Well, I think we are all ready for the festival. Let's go have some fun. Giddy up, Faith. Remember, bein' festive is what Oregon's all about. Lacy, you forgot your drink. Yuck, this is gross! What is this? It's an acquired taste, Faith. Bye, Grandma. Jingle, jingle! - Merry Christmas, Jake. - Merry Christmas. Hey, Lacy. I'm going over with my friends, but I want you to know, I'll be thinking about you. Well, if you need to find me, just look for the blinking lights. - I am one lucky dad. - You are the best dad. You don't sound so committed to that. I love her, she's my daughter. Lacy! We told you'd land the most eligible bachelor in town! Too bad, Jakey. I could've been all yours! - Okay, girl! - Whoo! It's true. So, is this too Christmassy for your all-black designer world? Stop! No, I think it's absolutely beautiful. I can completely see why this takes a full year to set up. Well, don't go stealin' our ideas now. We've got patents on all these designs. And if I do steal them, what you gonna do about it? Well, I might just have to lock you up for a long time and keep you here. Does that sound so bad? Oh, I don't know. I guess I could make the best out of it. Just so I don't have to dress like Santa's little helper every day. Hmm... How are you two kids enjoying this magnificent day? Can't say it could've turned out any better. Don, you always have such perfect timing. Well, you know I like to make my presence known. - And you look ravishing, my dear. - Oh, why, thank you. So do you. That's the only way this old fool can kiss a girl anymore. Mistletoe doesn't even work for him. He's gotta blind 'em with his tie. Stop it. All right, well, let's go get some of Rosie's famous glug. All right, you better be careful. One glug is one too many. Oh, believe me, I know. What are you two squawkin' about? Dot is saying that her Yule log is better than your mom's fruitcake. My Yule log is so much better, I don't have to put "famous" in front of it. Well, my fruitcake is "famous" because it's won awards in three separate counties. I'd take the fruitcake over the Yule log. That's convenient, you're her husband. - Well, you're her best friend. - Yeah. You two, weigh in. I plead the fifth. Oh, um, well, unfortunately, I haven't had Yule log or fruitcake before. We didn't have Christmas treats in my house. This is perfect. Lacy has never had either of these, ever. She will judge the winner! Oh, I... Why does she get both? Well, Faith, Lacy has never had Yule log or fruitcake, so she's gonna try Grandma's fruitcake and Dot's Yule log and decide which is best. Faith, please help me eat these. No way. With these crazy ladies, you're on your own. Thanks, Faith. Okay, everyone, I will do my best, but please don't hold it against me. Oh, it's so good. So creamy and smooth. Oh, this texture's just like tiramisu. You need to clean your palate before you taste mine, Lacy. It's chewy. There's some fruit, there's a cherry. And... there's a nut. Oh, can I have some more glug, please? Lacy, it's an acquired taste. I think we know who the winner is. Now, now, I've got my Christmas treats. Who wants some of my homemade caramel and candy apples? I love candy apples! I'll have one. Caramel apples are way better. I'll have one. Okay, how about my favorite? Christmas fudge, nuts or no nuts? - Nuts. Mm-hmm, yeah. - Nuts. Nuts. Looks like you're gonna be needed a bit more. I think my favorite Christmas treat is you. Who's that? Nora? Raymond? What-what are you doing here? Lacy, we've been trying to get a hold of you for days. Oh, ice storm took down the lines. They've been down a few days. Just went back up today. I'm, uh, Jake Maguire. My parents, Marcy and Hank. They own the B&B that Lacy's staying at here in town. Everyone, this is my boss, Nora, and my associate, Raymond. We work together back in Chicago at the design firm. Would you like to try some of my famous fruitcake? How about a plate of the Yule log that just won the taste test, - according to Lacy? - She did not pick yours. I have candy and caramel apples for you. Oh, do you like fudge with nuts or without? I'll bring you two mugs of glug. No, thank you. No, thank you. No, thank you, sir, thank you. I don't do fruitcake. There's drinks here or something? Lacy, I made a mistake. Jenna has made a mess of our two largest accounts. Well, she admitted to me that she stole your designs. She couldn't come up with anything. And now those two clients say that they will walk away unless you come back and head their accounts again. I made a mistake, but my mistake was not listening to Jenna, it was not promoting you to partner. Now, don't let my little mishap with Jenna deter you from what is rightfully yours. Lacy, just say yes! This is what you've always wanted. I am so honored and flattered that you came all this way to say this to me. I know you, you wouldn't do this for just anyone. Lacy, are you gonna leave us? Please, don't go. If you had asked me this two weeks ago, I would've jumped at the opportunity. I was so ready for it. I was anticipating it, and I was so furious when it didn't happen. I lost part of myself and what I needed in life. I met someone wonderful who told me that certain people come in and out of your life for different reasons. And I need to believe that. I wanna start living my life and being happy. So... as much as I would love to accept your amazing offer, I have to decline. But, Lacy, you're willing to just give up on your dream? I wouldn't say that. I think that people's dreams can change, and I think I want to start sharing mine. This stuff is fabulous! Such a distinct taste, I could drink it all day. Nora, I do have one recommendation for the company. My replacement should be Raymond. - Raymond? - Me? Yes, Raymond, you. Nora, I've never worked with anyone so talented. Our clients know Raymond and they love him. I can't imagine anyone else better suited to take lead than Raymond. Well, Raymond, we don't have much time. We need to get back to the office and hammer out the kinks that were created by you know who. I just wish it could have turned out slightly different. Thank you so much for everything you've done for me. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Lacy. Lacy, are you sure this is what you want? Raymond, the craziest thing has been happening since I got here. I feel like I've been living the same day over and over again, but it made me realize that I have a second chance at true love. A Christmas surprise. How many times have I been telling you that? Wait a minute, you don't like surprises. Who is he, okay? Not that Deputy Don character. No. Okay! Stud alert! Good for you, Lacy. Merry Christmas, you guys. Be nice to my friend. Little word of advice, she hates surprises. Hey, everyone, I'd like to get some glug to go if possible. It was so good! Nice to meet you all. Truly a pleasure to meet you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas! Does this mean you're staying, Lacy? Well, I don't know if you heard what just happened here, but I don't actually have a job to go back to anymore. So I was hoping you'd be willing to let me spend Christmas with you. Now, Faith, no more tricks, right? I have no idea what you're talking about. Merry Christmas, Lacy. Well, I don't suppose you heard all that. Yeah, you could say that. Well, it's out there now, and it's pretty awkward, but the truth is they're right. I haven't been much fun to be around at Christmas for a long time now, but you, Faith, and this crazy, crazy town have helped me find myself again and really believe in Christmas. I can't tell you what's been happening since I got here, but yesterday we just had the most amazing day together and I didn't want it to end. I was so worried I'd wake up and you and Faith wouldn't be here. And then there was this reindeer, and you and Faith covered in gold. And then I woke up again, and I-I know I'm not making a lot of sense right now, but the point is, I finally figured out what my Christmas surprise is and it's all that matters to me now. You and Faith are my Christmas surprise, Jake. Well... I'm glad that you figured that out because you're our Christmas surprise, too, Lacy. You know, Jake, I'm gonna need one more Christmas surprise from you. What's that? I'm gonna need you to kiss me under that mistletoe again. Yep, that's me. Merry Christmas, Lacy. Merry Christmas, Jake. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Well, Lacy finally got her Christmas surprise. She may have repeated a few days to find it, but the Christmas spirit will always find you. And in Lacy's case, she found love through Christmas do-overs, eventually figuring out that life is always filled with surprises. Embracing them enabled her to find what she was missing. Lacy found her true love and she was gifted the love of a child. That's the ultimate Christmas surprise.
