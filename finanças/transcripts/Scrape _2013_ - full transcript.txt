[ominous music] [sobbing] - [Woman] Please. No, please. Please, don't. No, no. [screams] [dramatic music] - [Narrator] About five years ago, or something like that, Mick and Maggie Hedgeworth moved into town on account of Mick landing a new sales job. The Hedgeworth's took up residence in a small rent house near some railroad tracks owned by Mick's boss, Barry Sagan. Barry lived across the street in an even smaller house. Why anyone that owned two houses would choose to live in the smaller one beats me. But then again Barry was an interesting fellow. He was quiet, reserved, loved to scrapbook. He didn't have many friends, but not because he was an asshole or anything. He was just weird. Mick didn't have many friends either, but that's because he was an asshole. So naturally they made a good team. That's Barry. That's Mick right there. Maggie. And that's Mick's little boy, Hunter, from a previous marriage. Oh, and that's Barry's dog, Yoshi. [dog barking] Ordinary people in an ordinary town. Ordinary right up to the moment women in the area starting going missing, and I tell ya, in this town, there's nothing ordinary about that. [horn blaring] [woman screaming] [heavy metal music] [Barry humming] - The use of polka dots as my background really makes the fireworks stand out. This much kit is indeed the bomb. [laughing] [heavy breathing] [classical music] - [Hunter] Let's go, Mom. It's Father's Day. - [Woman] Okay, Hunter. - Mom, I'm doing it. [laughing] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] Hey Mom, check this out. [laughing] [horn blaring] [gasping] [ominous music] [screaming] Mom, you okay? [ominous music] Mom, Mom look. I'm doing it, I'm flying. - [Newscaster] It's a dark day in DeBrock town as police have announced yet another local woman is missing. Colleen Fredrick, a 19-year old college student was reported missing four days ago by her parents and her roommate. Earlier today the police arrived on the scene to investigate a bloody pair of shoes discovered in the woods outside of DeBrock Town, but no trace of Fredrick's body was found. Two small children were playing in a dry creek bed when they stumbled upon the shoes which were later identified by Fredrick's parents as a gift they gave their daughter last Christmas. Colleen Fredrick's disappearance marks the ninth local woman to go missing in just three months. Last week, Carol Peterson, a 26-year old makeup artist was reported missing and was last seen near the same woods where police are investigating Colleen Fredrick's disappearance. Investigators speculate that each disappearance these last three months is related to the next. Police have stated that there are no suspects at this time, as they search for the nine missing women. [ominous music] [shredder rumbling] [phone ringing] - No, I want what I ordered, and you didn't send me what I ordered! Listen to me, you little acne dick face. I want the black cat. Now you send them to me or I'm gonna shove these little kitten shit sticks up every hole I can find. Yes. Send them there, that's perfect. Thanks George. Always a pleasure. - Get what you needed? - [Mick] I always do. - [Barry] Yes, you do. - Unless I get that poodle replica built, I'm gonna blow it tonight. Are you in? Take those little artsy queer photos of yours. - Queer isn't he word you were looking for. [chuckles] But yes, I'm in. My explosion scrapbook is coming along very nicely. - Yes, it is. Very nice, Barry. - Thank you, Linda. - Maggie said she saw this mask thing attack a woman, and then they disappeared. Actually thinks the woman's dead. Really freaked her out. - You don't sound concerned. - I don't know. It's weird. I'm telling you, man. She might be a little loco. I mean, she went to the police and they didn't find any evidence. They're looking though missing persons. Mags didn't wanna talk about it. She hates to admit she's scared, and she is. - [Barry] Hmm. - I don't really know what else to do, except... Blow up a mother effing poodle. Hey, thanks B. - [Barry] Mm-hmm. - Tonight? - Tonight. [phone ringing] [humming] - Hi Barry. - Linda. What can I do for you? - I... I. I was wondering if maybe you'd like to join... [sighs] Village Cuisine I hear has food. - I was doing to have dinner tonight with Mick and Maggie. - Oh. - Why don't you join us? - Really? - [Barry] Mm-hmm. - Oh, that would be swell. [laughs] [vacuum rumbling] - I think Linda was trying to ask me out on a date. - It's about time you got some. - [Barry] Don't be crass. - I'll give you crass, like my blowup doll poodle. - [Barry] New car? - Dream car. - [Barry] And you parked it illegally all day? - Yeah. - Now I know why you're a month behind on your rent. [laughs] The four of us are going out to dinner tonight. - What? No, what about the poodle blow up? - We'll just have to postpone 'til tomorrow. - Just go out with her. You don't need a chaperone. - I don't think of Linda that way. And besides, I get extremely uncomfortable in reciprocated sexual situations. - Okay, fine. But one day, old man. - Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. I know. I gotta get some. [laughs] 8:15, Village Cuisine. - [Mick] Got it. - Mm-mmm. [tires squealing] Linda. You look glorious. - Good evening, your table is ready now. - Thank you. Shall we? [giggling] [classical music] [whispering] - Are you guys ready to order or do you need a few more minutes? - I think we need a few more minutes, please. - [Waitress] You got it. Can I get you some more water in the meantime? - That would be great, thank you. [ice cubes clanking] - Alrighty, I'll be back in a few. - Mmm, Mmm, that's tasty bread. - So, you and Barry scrapbook together? - Well, yes. And work, of course. - Mick speaks so fondly of you. He says you're the lightboat of the office. - Well, if I'm the light, then... Mick is the laugh. [laughs] - Very true, Linda. - [Newscaster] Police announced earlier today that another local woman is missing. Nicole Lyon, a 45-year old physical education teacher at Level High School and mother of two was reported missing by her husband and mother-in-law after not being heard from for over a week. Police say that Lyon was last... [speaking in foreign language] Johnson Memorial Park near Matthew Walton Road in the south DeBrock town. Lyon, a physical fitness advocate and last year's winner of the annual DeBrock... [speaking in foreign language] At Adam Wade Johnson Memorial Park. - I wanna go home. I'll go pick up Hunter. - [Newscaster] Saw her entering the park... - Um, excuse me. Linda, it was a pleasure. Barry. - [Newscaster] One victim spoke... [speaking in foreign language] Police have yet to find any evidence to back up the claim. Police have stated that they'll be continuing to search. - Well, I guess we better call it a night. - [Newscaster] First woman in the area not to... - I just live a few blocks that way. - You walked? [chuckles] - I've been advised to walk more. I love the Village Cuisine because it's so close to home. - I think that's marvelous, Linda. And thanks again for joining our very entertaining dinner. My apologies for its abrupt ending. - Yeah, so, I gotta jet. If I don't get home with Hunter pronto Mags is gonna rip me a new nose hole. - Again, it was delightful. And as always, I'll see you probably at 8:00 a.m. - Yes. Of course. Thanks for dinner. - Goodnight. [dramatic music] [shrill scraping] [ominous music] [growling] [gasping] [screaming] [gasping] [suspenseful music] [whimpering] [growling] [gasping] - No, no no no. No, please. Oh, oh. Oh God. Oh, oh no. No. No. [whimpering] Leave me alone. [screams] [gasping] [growling] [ominous music] [growling] [shrill scraping] [ominous music] [shrill scraping] [knocking] [growling] [gasping] [shrill scraping] [suspenseful music] - Mags, I'm home. - [Maggie] You're doing this to me, aren't you? - Whoa, whoa whoa, what the hell are you doin'? - Don't screw with me, Micky. - Honestly, Maggie, I don't know what you're talking about, all right. I just got home and the house was dark. Baby, what are you doing? You're acting a little crazy. - Let's go, Yoshi. Come on. Let's go Yoshi. - Barry. Have you seen or heard anything like in the past five minutes? - I'm not quite sure how you want me to answer that. I've heard crickets, a distant train. - No, no no no, like somebody in the property. - No, I haven't, but I've only been home for a couple of minutes. - [Mick] I think she's scared. - You're damn I'm scared. I saw that thing again, and the girl is missing. [speaking in foreign language] - Oh oh, okay, okay, okay. I'll keep my eyes open and my ears peeled. - Okay. - Now, Hunter, is he okay? Did he hear or see anything? - No, no no. He sleeps through everything. He's fine. - Well, Yoshi hasn't finished his business yet. I'll take a lap around the property and make sure everything is copacetic. I'm just a few yards away. Knock any time. - Thank you. You're such a good person and the best landlord ever. Dick! - What did I do? Hey, thanks Barry. Tomorrow the poodle goes boom. Hey, baby, wait up. Come on. [humming] [dog barking] 400 pages of bureaucratic BS could not stop the sale from going through. Yes! Triple king locket is mine. - I wonder if you actually do work here. - Yep, sure thing, George. Buying a little fireworks is my job. - No it is not. [chuckles] Have you seen Linda today? - [Mick] Nope. - Heard from her? - Nope. - She hasn't come into work today. - She's probably at home doing nasty things to the thought of you. - Repugnant. - Hey. Poodle, tomorrow. - [Barry] Mm-hmm. [train horn blaring] - [Mick] You ready, Barry? - Sure, Mick. [fuse sizzling] [laughing] - What? No way, man. No freakin' way. I used five Chinese screws on that thing. Do you see that tree right there? That tree is laying there dead because I blew it up, and I can't blow up a Papier-mache constructed poodle. [suspenseful music] - Oh Mick. - Cover. [explosion cracking] - Glad I didn't get pictures of that. I tend to appreciate your firework displays more. - Yeah, man, still blowin' shit up though. Those fireworks are always stuffed into something. - Yes. But I only take the pretty pictures. - Are you a homo, Barry? - Stop asking me that. - I've known you for five years, and I've never seen you with a woman. Or a man for that matter. - You probably haven't noticed, I'm an old man. There isn't much need for me to be gallivantin' around town with a woman. That would be crass. - Old people can still, you know... [grunts] - Don't be so uncouth. - Stop using words like uncouth and crass and doltish. What the hell is doltish anyway? [laughing] - Exactly, my friend. [dramatic music] [humming] - To the rescue. Victory, yeah. [humming] Do do do do, do do. Ow, don't press them buttons. [ominous music] - Hey, kid, are you having fun? Hunter? Hunter. - Mom, look what I found? [gasping] - [Maggie] Mick! [sobbing] - [Mick] What is it? What's wrong, what happened? - [Maggie] Hunter found it. [ominous music] - It's okay, bud. Go play your video games. - Mags, you okay? - Hunter found a severed finger. - [Barry] What? Where? - By that entrance, the crawl entrance. He was playing with his toys, just playing. It was that masked monster. - [Mick] Okay, sssh! - It was here! - It's okay, all right. - I'm here, all right. We're here. - I need you guys to look and you guys to go under the house and look. - [Mick] Okay, all right. - I need to know. - We'll go right now, okay? [ominous music] [train rumbling] - I'll go first. You look scared. - You made a joke. Funny. - What exactly is it I'm lookin' for in here? - Oh, the dame attached to that finger. - Huh? [fly buzzing] How you know it's a dame? - Hey, you gonna move in a little bit further so you can see what's goin' on? - Mick, please. [growling] [ominous music] - What did you find? [dog barking] - Just a stray dog. He's been burying his bones up under your house. - Yeah, that finger coulda come from anywhere. - I see a hole. Looks like he's been stuffin' his food in there. - Look, I'll take the dog to the pound. - And I'll call the sheriff about this finger. - Everything will be back to normal in no time. Sound good, honey? - Yeah, sure. I'm gonna take Hunter for some ice cream. Just let me know what the sheriff says. - Okay, love. - Of course. - Are you sure you don't want me to call the sheriff? - It's my property. I'll handle it. Get goin', boy. [animal howling] [ominous music] [banging] [ominous music] [gasping] [heavy breathing] [growling] [gasping] - [Hunter] Mom! Mom! - Hunter? Mick? It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. - Did you have a bad dream? - Where were you? - What? - He was here. - Ssh. It's okay, Hunter. - Champ, it was just a bad dream. - Could I sleep with you? - Sure, kiddo. Where were you? - What do you mean where was I? - Don't you dare use that shit. What do you mean? You know exactly what I was asking. Damn it, Mick. Something is happening to us. - Oh, something's happening to us? - Don't mock me. This is happening. Are you doing this? - What? - Don't touch me. - Mags, why would I try to scare you and Hunter? - Because you've done it before. - What are you talking about? - Two Halloweens ago. - That was Halloween. - Shut up. - You're losin' it, Maggie. - Am I, Mick? Then where were you? - I was in my lounge. - Get out. - What? - You're not spending the night here tonight. Get out! [sighing] - Mick. - [Mick] Barry. [bed creaking] - Did you wanna talk about it? - She thinks I'm some kind of boogie man out to scare her and Hunter. She's petrified of me. You know Hunter's Mom thought the same thing about me before she split town? - Did you try to smooth the situation over? - Probably not. - Probably not indeed. Get some sleep. - Believe in monsters, Barry? - Maybe. - Come on, Bar. There's no such thing as monsters. - Sure there are. Just depends on your definition. - [Mick] Barry, would you turn this shitty music off? - [Barry] Sure, Mick. [bird squawking] [dog barking] [ominous music] [dogs barking] - Hello. Hello. Hello. Somebody here? [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] [whimpering] [groaning] Come on. No, no. [sobbing] Leave me alone! [screams] [bird squawking] [ominous music] ♪ Come to me, come to me ♪ Come to me, come to me, come to me ♪ ♪ Come to me, come to me, come to me ♪ [ominous music] - I'm sorry. I should have been more understanding. I'm an idiot. - Thank you. - So what can I do? I wanna make you feel safe. - It's crossed my mind to move. - Oh? - I don't wanna be scared, Mick. I don't want Hunter to be scared. - I get it, okay? I do. Why don't we start by changing out all the door and window locks? - Sure. But I'm still gonna look for another place. - Oh, of course. I just, hate to lose Barry as a landlord. - You have such a weird bromance with that old dude. [laughing] - Whatever. You like that old dude too. - Yes, I do. Thanks for understanding. Even though it took you so long. - I love you. I'm gonna have to go to work now. - Ew! - Oh, come on. - No, no. - Please. - No, if you're lucky. Leave. [ominous music] [keyboard clacking] - Hey buddy. Mick. How'd it go with Maggie? [sighing] - We might move. - Oh no. - Yeah, man, you're the best damn landlord we've ever had and she wants to move. I mean, not to mention that bitchin' pice of land across the tracks. Where else am I gonna have access to explosion heaven? - Well, you will be stayin' in town? - Of course. I mean, I like my job. Or at least my boss. - Compliments are always appreciated, Mick. Say, have you heard from Linda? - Nope. - Me neither. She's been out for four days now, and no one else had heard from her. - That's Linda. Her cats probably. - Don't, Mick. - What? - I need you to go check on her. - No, Barry. You do that. - Mick, please. - I'll do it tomorrow before work. I got something I gotta do today. - Good enough. - Hey, by the way. Maggie wants to take some pictures of Hunter. Could I borrow one of your cameras? - Sure thing. - Thanks Barry. - [Barry] Mm-hmm. [dramatic music] [fuse sizzling] [explosion snapping] - [Mick] Cool. [humming] - I appreciate you changing all the locks. But to be honest I'm not quite sure if that will completely help. - I know, but this is my house and my property and I want you to feel protected. To be honest, I don't want you to move out. Mick is the very best friend I've ever had, and I've grown fond of you and your family. - Back at ya, Barry. Hey, Stace will be coming over tomorrow around four-ish. I'm taking Mick on a little date time. Just to make up for that craziness. But it's a secret. Don't tell him. - Oh, that's an excellent idea. - Just thought, you know, so maybe you could keep your ears open just in case anything weird happens. - Well, of course. Got it. - More coffee? - Afraid not. No, thanks. I think I'll just head to my little homestead. [dance music] ♪ Come to me [ominous music] - Shit. [phone ringing] [ominous music] [phone ringing] Hello? [giggles] I'm just leaving the club. I know, baby. I miss you already. [giggles] I had a good time tonight as well. I'm fine, I'm fine. I am almost to my car. [gasps] [sobbing] No, please. [groaning] [grunting] - Do you actually work? - You know it. - [Barry] Mmm, mmm mmm. - So I went by Linda's. No answer. Neighbor lady came out when I was knocking. It was the old hag. Anyway, she said she hadn't seen Linda since last Friday. - Wait a minute. Last Friday, that's when we... - That's the night we all went out to dinner. I guess she never made it home. - We've gotta report this. - Let her family report it. - I don't think she has a family. Don't tell Maggie about this. - Oh, hell now. From now on I talk about ice cream cones and puppy dogs. - Good. I'll take care of this. Why don't you cut out early? Go home and be with your family. - All right. You have suggested that twice. Thanks, B. - [Barry] Mm-hmm. - Off comes your head. No, help, help. Emergency, help. Hey, help, help, help us. [hissing] Waterman down. - [Maggie] We should be back no later than nine. - That's not a very long night. - It's all the time we need. - Ooh, Mrs. Hedgeworth. Scandalous. - Made sure he's in bed by 8:30. He hasn't been sleeping very well. Might have to read to him something light, happy. - Yeah, sure, absolutely. - Mr. Barry's always next door if you need him. - Yeah, sure. - Be nice to Miss Stacy. - I will. Waterman died in the battle. - I bet it was an epic battle. - It was. - [Maggie] Bye guys. - Bye Mom. - Bye Mrs. Hedgeworth. [ominous music] Now I think you need to go around the other side. There you go, right there. Oh, oh there he is, there he is. Shoot him. There, all right. Good job. [ominous music] Did you see that? - The door does that all the time. - Well, I'd prefer it open. - [Hunter] Yeah, me too. [ominous music] - It's just old, remember? - Miss Stacy? Miss Stacy. [ominous music] Miss Stacy. Miss Stacy! [glass shattering] [gasping] [ominous music] - Hunter, are you okay? The front door was open. It was just a draft. [suspenseful music] Wait, wait Hunter. Who's in the house? What are you talking about? - He's gonna kill us. - [Stacy] What, who's gonna kill us? Why are you saying that? - Don't leave. - I've gotta call your parents. [ominous music] - [Scraper] I want my finger back. [growling] - Oh, no no. [screams] No, Hunter! [screams] [suspenseful music] [heavy breathing] [growling] [growling] [fireworks cracking] [heavy breathing] - Please be Mom and Dad. [ominous music] [growling] - Hunter! Hunter! Stacy! Stacy. Hunter. Stacy. Hunter! Where are you guys? - Gonna help me get the rest of the stuff or what? - They're not here. - What? - They're not here. - Hunter. - Stacy! - Hunter. - [Maggie] Hunter, are you hiding? - They probably just went to the store or something. - [Maggie] I'll go through the cell. [phone ringing] - What the hell? - Barry. - What? - Yeah, they probably fell asleep at Barry's. - You're right. You know, they're either at Barry's or the shed. - I'm gonna go change, and then I'll go check at Barry's. - All right, me too. I'm gonna go down to the shed. Hunter better not be messin' with my fireworks again. [dramatic music] [sighs] What the hell? You gotta be kidding me. Hunter. I'm gonna kill that kid. - Barry. Barry. [shrill scraping] - Hunter. Hunter. [sighs] [groaning] Maggie! - Barry, it's Maggie. - [Mick] Maggie! - Mick? - Maggie! [grunting] [groans] [growling] [train horn blaring] [fireworks snapping] - [Scraper] Wait. What about Hunter? Don't you wanna know what happened to your son? - [Mick] Ssh, ssh ssh ssh ssh. Ssh, ssh ssh ssh ssh ssh. - [Scraper] You all will die. [whimpering] [growling] - Mick, Mick, we gotta get help. - Go, get out of here. Go, go! [sobbing] [dramatic music] [growling] [heavy breathing] - [Scraper] It's not your fault. But you got too close, my friend. [grunting] [groaning] [growling] [growling] [groaning] [whimpering] [train horn blaring] [sobbing] - [Maggie] No. No, no no. No. [gasps] No! [growling] No! [fireworks snapping] [coughing] No, don't. Please. Please. Stop. Oh no. [groaning] - [Scraper] It was never meant to be you. But you got in the way. [train horn blaring] - I don't know, ladies. I'm just not feeling super duper today. I think I'm gonna cut my scrapbooking time short. - [Woman] Of course, Barry. Of course. So you don't have to worry about cooking. - Thank you. I don't know what I'd do without you ladies. Thank you. - You're welcome. [classical music] [birds chirping] - Hey. Hi Yoshi. Okay, okay.
