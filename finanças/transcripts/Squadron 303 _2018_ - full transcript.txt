CHURCHILL (VO): Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilisation. All fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free. But if we fail, then the whole world including the United States including all that we have known and cared for... will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves... that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years men will still say: "This... was their finest hour." - Tolo, what's he saying? He's saying that when we finally start combat... we'll be fighting not only for Poland. ENGINES HUM PLANE ENGINE CHUGS MILITARY-STYLE MUSIC PLAYS CAMERA WHIRS MAN, IN GERMAN: Attention!

And the English have 1000 planes including 600 fighters. We outnumber them 3 to 1. But one of our aircraft is like two of theirs which gives us 6 to 1. Pretty well, isn't it? Poland and France are already conquered. Now give me the head of that English bulldog. HE CHUCKLES - OFFICER: Sieg Heil! MEN CHANT: Sieg Heil! IN GERMAN: Ah, I love the aroma of a good cigar.

More patience? Yes. More patience. Thank you. PLANE CHUGS OFFICER: This Royal Geographical Society saving policy. What do you make of it? I always thought the idea was we sent our boys off to conquer overseas and they sent back the spoils to King and Country. Now it seems like... we're asking any foreigner who's got a grudge against Herr Hitler to come over here and enjoy our hospitality. Quite! One of Winston's more eccentric ideas, I'd say.

Well done! Send in the Pole. Enter. Flying Officer Zumbach to see you, sir. Yes, send him in. Zumbach. Well, come forward. Flying Officer Zumbach, you might consider yourself somewhat of a daredevil. Risking your life is one thing - the lives of other people not to mention our rather expensive planes... That's just reckless. Reckless? - Quite. Sir. I shot the Messerschmitt down! - VINCENT: That is not true. Observer Corp hasn't reported any downed Messerschmitt. Flying Officer Zumbach, you are being reprimanded for insubordination. Your lot have to learn to take orders from their superior officers. You will be trained to learn our battle tactics. That's all, thank you. So up to this point we've lost 432 planes. And we're producing new ones. Planes, yes, but not the pilots quickly enough to fly them. That's why we need to get the Poles on board. Are they up to it? - Doubt it. They've already lost two wars. Then why use them? - An average pilot survives 10 hours in battle. The best, two weeks. We need the Poles to buy us some time SO we can train up our own chaps. And what happens to the Poles? They all die? And you don't care. Has anyone ever told you you're a cold-hearted pig? They don't have to. My reflection tells me that every morning when I'm shaving. RADIO: One of our CBS correspondents in London, Eric Tate told us from Trafalgar Square that the Germans were continuing their all-day attacks around London. DOOR OPENS - But the British remain unimpressed. Oh, Jones... What does MI5 want this time? Hitler and his bloody army are about to cross the English Channel but of course the most important thing is that your feet are dry. The Royal Air Force is keeping Britain's feet dry. Yes, but for how long? I don't know. - Well, let me tell you. Two months, max. Unless we use the 8,000 Polish air and ground crew at our disposal. They didn't do very well against the Germans. They'll buy us time until the Americans enter the war. Bloody Poles. Sir, would you like to join me? Yeah, sure. Well done. - Thank you. Now your turn. I can see you've made yourself at home. What icon is it? - MAN: Our Lady of Czestochowa. She's been with us since the Deblin School. She protects us. OFFICER, IN POLISH: Gentlemen, remember that you've got only 300 bullets of ammo. That is enough for only 18 seconds of firing. At ease. How are things, Major? Will we turn them into fighter pilots? I'll train them to be able to fly even on a barn door. Who's next? OK. Daszewski. I also need a volunteer. Please, choose someone today. - OK, Tolo, go. Today, you go. - No, you go. Cadet Zumbach, please come here. Cadet Zumbach... please hit me. Don't be shy. Just hit me here. PILOTS CHANT: Janek, Janek, Janek! Gentlemen... Just hit me. Don't be shy. THEY CHUCKLE You see, cadet, in order to attack effectively you need to be as close as possible... Ah! - Ooh! And attack by surprise. That's how you should act in the air. Fire when you're really close to the enemy and catch him by surprise. I always tell my mechanics to synchronise the guns from 250 metres to 150 metres. That way you're saving ammo and are far more effective. Now, in place of engineer Kochan, his beloved daughter, Jagoda Kochan. She'll explain why P-11s choke when they dive during acrobatics. Miss Jagoda, come here, please. I'll also watch... I mean, listen. OK. So I'll tell you how it looks. It looks good. Very good! - THEY LAUGH Gentlemen! The reason for this engine's behaviour is its float carburettor. During violent acrobatics, it simply chokes. It's said the Germans have direct fuel injection but we aren't sure. I'll show you on the model, but I need a volunteer! Me! - Me!

Russia invaded in the east. The Germans are everywhere. Who are these children? Hello, hi! From a village. I have to help hem to find their parents. For now they only have me. So... listen.

RADIO CRACKLES RADIO: The RAF is bombing German and Italian bases in revenge against the Nazi air offensive. The next couple of weeks of Luftwaffe air operations are likely to prove, one way or the other if the Nazis will defeat the British and achieve air supremacy. British air raids on northern Italy have caused Mussolini to make vigorous protests to neutral Switzerland which is being overflown by the RAF. The Swiss are, in turn, protesting to London about abuse of their airspace but can do little about it. KNOCK ON DOOR Come in. Sir, Flying Officer Urbanowicz. Sir. Sir. Pilot Officer you will take over the command from Squadron Leader Krasnodebski. 303 Squadron is now combat operational. Thank you, sir. - Tell me... how do you think your compatriots will fare? You'll not find better pilots on this Earth, sir. Attention! At ease. Gentlemen... it is important to understand that we are all many cogs in the machine that is the defence of Great Britain. Our radar networks and coastal observation stations give us just 15 minutes warning of impending German attack. If even one squadron lags, we lose that advantage. We fight as one unified fist. Is that clear? If 1 may... I know all of you. Some of you I've taken under my wing and trained personally and... I know the fight is in your hearts and that you are more than just cogs in the machine, but... I know that you are worried. That your thoughts are with your families back home. Our... brothers and sisters in the underground Resistance continue to fight the enemy whether he be Nazi or Bolshevik but focus, gentlemen. Be here. Think what each one of them would give to be where you are now. Because here is the only piece, the last piece of our free Poland. Our Polish army is here. We are here! We are the Polish army! And we refused to surrender in '39 and we'll continue the fight as long as we draw breath. Our enslaved brothers and sisters put their faith in us and... you know how they call us back home? The Angels of Vengeance. But enough talking. You were born to be fighters, so give those bloody Germans hell! THEY CHEER AND APPLAUD And show everyone here how it's done, OK?

Sounds like rather good stuff. Have the newspapers been told? - No. Not yet. And I'm rather inclined to think that Kent and Kellett did the killing while the Poles are trying to take the credit. Perhaps you ought to fly with them. Ha! JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS To Squadron 303! THEY CHEER Sorry, Ox, your tab is empty. I'll order on General Sikorski's tab. - No, no, no!
