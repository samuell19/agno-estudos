My father said the world has not been the same since the day I was born change is the only proof for the passage of time some say this place changed for the better some say it changed for the worse whatever they say I will find the answers I need from the world that I live in my name is snow fuyu I am 23 years old We are all united, not only to pay our respects to the best father of son or daughter could have but rather, our mentor, a spiritual leader! Who's this kid? Is he really going to take over the Don' business? He's an adopted son, who was previously a disciple. I heard from uncle vulcan until I am ready to inherit his ambition, and his noble career this is absolutely ridiculous inherit all of his property! I remember the Don has a real daughter yes, but nobody's seen her in twenty years, some say she's dead allow me to introduce him he's the Don' adoptive son, tempest he seldom partakes in the family business so he's not too familiar with all the disciples among us today and all of the friends we've made over the years in this business I've known the Don for 36 years, and I've always admired him the Don once said, the most perfect funeral would be one that gathered his disciples together share experiences with one another with a smile I promised him immediately if he passes away first, then I'd bring everyone back together and make it the most noble of all funerals I will fulfill his final wish and bring this family forward uncle vulcan, how would you like your funeral to be? Copy you I'm snow fuyu, the Don' illegitimate daughter I guess I'm your sister She is rain fuyu she's disappeared for twenty years and nobody has mentioned about her I really want to know why do some people need to take drugs but why some people try so hard to stay sober In this time of conflict amongst the family she chose to come back. But some people try so hard to remain sober? Rain, it's been twenty years why didn't you give me a heads up? Uncle vulcan you chose to come back now, which means you still care for the family you wouldn't want his business to crumble, would you? You know what I'm capable of I'm a much better candidate than that little brat tempest alas, my last name isn't fuyu, some people won't acknowledge me uncle vulcan needs you, a real heir by blood just go out there and tell everyone to keep the status quo that'll keep things in order it's very comforting to see you again after all these years after what happened in Myanmar if I followed the Don' orders you wouldn't be here anymore but I watched you grow up, how could 1? So I decided to hide you from the world and then you went missing for twenty years Get out get out You've grown up where have you been all these years? I haven't heard anything from you since I returned from studying abroad they won't tell me anything I've envied you all these years being able to leave here and study abroad live a normal life, unlike me normal? I'm the only one who doesn't know how to cook meth I am just a mascot I'm just a front for this corporation you'll always be my previous baby brother But we're not related by blood I should be the one thanking you if it weren't for you, father would've have adopted me and I wouldn't have fuyu as my last name nobody would recognize me as a suitable heir except for you especially those fuckers, uncle vulcan that stinky old street rat they think I'm an unworthy piece of trash just spend a month with me, entertaining the elders after I take over, you can take your share and live a good life but I don't want to take part in the business if tempest takes over, do you think he'll let go of a pure blood like you? Now that I'm back, I can help you how? We now trade through intermediaries, that old fox has all the product Then I can build you a new lab then uncle vulcan would be redundant, and we can ship our own product that's great, that's great! Why are you so smart? Thank you thank you so much I know you're rain fuyu and that you met with uncle vulcan and tempest today I have no interest in what you want to do and I can keep a secret in front of them but under one condition tell me everything about the Don why? My mother passed away when I was little I don't have much recollection of her nobody ever told me anything about him like your existence, and what his business was about if I want answers, I have to seek for them myself After all these years, I'd still think about the first time the Don took me out to see fireflies why can't I see any fireflies? Be patient When they're not glowing, they're just small black dots some glow in unsuitable places and some die before they can glow papa papa, papa! Papal! Papal! Papal! Papal! Hey lady, do you want some? Hey, you're gonna need this too hey, run! Run! Come on! Enough Shopping, and having coffee back to see your family? Remember what you are? You're supposed to be dead you resurrected because you became my mole but you cannot just disappear keep this turned on any time of day report on everything you do, and every person you meet I need to know how fire imports and exports within three weeks if I need to search for you again, I'm revoking your identity then I'll deport you, do you understand? Yes, madam Smoking again? Rain was under the Don" tuition since she was six she knew how to cook meth by the time she was ten she didn't even know that what she made was called crystal meth Because of rain's success the Don started adopting orphans of different nationalities and ages and called them his 'disciples' Although she didn't tell me why she was approaching both tempest and uncle vulcan nor did she tell me what happened twenty years ago but I know that there's an irrational trust between rain and I I can feel that she is under a huge amount of psychological pressure I guess she told me all of those stories because she needed somewhere to vent I envy rain because father once said that all the others are disciples but she was the only Princess What are you doing? Hello? Rain, come with me to meet some brokers tomorrow alright Are we really doing it here? This business is about efficiency it doesn't have to be fancy hotels, or vip lounges We're in yau ma tei, but why can't we find the Jade market? We had a friend who got his hands on some premium Jade from Yangon we have to go and check it out this time no way, we said we'd go to causeway bay for thai food I've had enough the tour guide said this would take two hours this journey is not scientific at all my cousin is buying biscuits in causeway bay one more stop bring it back for me later brother, do you have pen? You're in luck, I've signed big deals with this pen this is god of wealth's pen fate has brought us together, which horse should I go for? My lucky number is 4 that's the number of death, it's too strong of a word it's important to have fun when you're out here you're an expert, maybe you'll make heaps this time then that's it, we choose no. 4 we'll choose the runners up like last time, I'll pick 2, you pick 3, and you pick 1 sure, we won a lot last time wait, I want to change my mind I want no. 5 we have a designated number each time, don't mess it up don't forget, we didn't win last time I fronted all of the money it's everyone's money, we have to all agree on the number don't be too risky this brother is right, I'm very superstitious better leave things unchanged you better listen to them no, I need no. 5 I deserve it you can't always get what you want. Are you in charge? If that's the case, then I'm out but my horses can make money it's okay if you quit, a lot of people want a piece of the pie times have changed, don't be so foolish you've picked the wrong team I've said it before, it's better to maintain status quo I really do love Hong Kong car accidents happen so efficiently You've grown up She's my sister, here to get rid of uncle vulcan so... have you helped her? Ms. fuyu is downstairs It doesn't work! I don't understand why father would want me to manage all these companies that don't make money only focusing on the local market how am I gonna bring in ephedrine for the lab? Which companies do you have in hand? Companies under the fuyu corporation include a commodities factory producing mainly household cleaning products and this factory for electrical appliances such as household electrical products and parts there is also a factory for Chinese medicine a toy factory, and a laundry workshop the Don has already built a lab for you You get the solution, right? It's cool if you have a solution, then let's get ready just ask them to do it Let me compile some information, and send it to you I'll just help you with that, it'll be quicker then we can celerbate at night I can do it myself, let's celebrate later April, come in Why are you hurt? Because of my work whenever you create something meaningful in this world a lot of people will question you and use irrational feelings, and personal preferences or a so-called set of value to tell you that you're wrong but noboby knows whether something is right or wrong they question you because your work does not benefit them so they become dissatisfied and unhappy why do we need to make them happy? Exactly whatever we do, someone is bound to be unhappy so we don't need to care what others think just do whatever makes us happy I want papa to be happy Papa also wants you to be happy because rain is papa's creation Creation flower mountain range ocean trees firefly work of nature snow rain Don' creation people god's creation taking drugs is a choice but does sober entail logic? Uncle vulcan tempest Don my family snow what about me? Rain I want to change how about my place? Sit here I've never been properly educated whatever is right or wrong in this world was instilled upon me by the Don I don't know why, I've never questioned whether what he said was right or wrong I'm the same as you, I never went to school I wasn't allowed to leave the house alone father only gave me a computer with Internet access he asked me one question very day and I had to search for the answer myself until I reached sixteen years old he finally let me leave the house by myself to see the world I still remember, I really enjoyed walking the streets alone looking at the city along the way eavesdropping on conversations I got to know a lot of people around my age then I became curious why some people lived life happily and what made some people lived a life of rage I started to search for answers in reality but I couldn't find it Maybe the answers do not exist in this world or perhaps my answer is your question This is my sister I was drenched, and wanted a change of clothes Take a shower sure I'll do it myself How did you get that scar on the back of your neck? Chemical burn a gift from the Don There are many ways to make crystal meth it depends what ingredients you have those that are easily accessible will make the process more difficult over the years, fuyu corporation had a lot of partners spread across different social classes, and occupations some people don't even know what's hidden within their goods being smuggled in and out of Hong Kong more than 20 million cargo containers come in and out of Hong Kong there's food, clothes, toys, home appliances there might be a cargo container with meth that's worth billions I devise a suitable formula for each lab according to the ingredients they have access to there three key substances phenylacetone, ammonia, and dimethyl sulfate I've broken the process down to five steps producing each step under the cover of tempest's five factories the final step of cooking meth is amination which produces a lot of toxic gas, so there's higher risk we need a place that's hidden and safe Since we've broken up all the steps if someone investigates, we're just producing legal chemicals I know that you're having trouble with your products recently but products of this standard my apologies, but this is absolutely unacceptable trouble? What kind of trouble? Uncle vulcan, is this really the product from Myanmar? I've heard that the largest supplier in the wa state is not selling to you anymore because you killed his uncle This product of Myanmar is up to par? - Thank you. - Thank you how much do we have left of the shipment from Myanmar? That was the last 2kg of it nobody wants that shit from Vietnam and Cambodia I shouldn't have only killed your uncle I should've killed your whole family I was in contact with the tungs' from wa state in Myanmar there's a moba who's been missing for three years I heard news that the biggest broker in Thailand has him Ms. fuyu, please get in - Hello? - Someone told me that they saw tempest's goons transport supplies to the diamond hill crematorium you're an expert, bring someone there with you if he wants to get in to the funeral business, I give him my blessing if he wants to build his own lab, then destroy it understood your life is precious, don't do it yourself don't worry Give me your phones to the diamond hill crematorium is it going to get dirty? Do we need... Do I need to answer to you? Drive It might be dangerous, how about we send a scout? No need, follow me, stay tight Don't move Are you aiming your gun at the wrong person? Why did you kill uncle vulcan's subordinates? What kind of place is this? What do you want? We both have the wrong person I'm a cop, you have to help me report to madam Hong, and call for back up So you're an undercover sent by madam Hong are you investigating uncle vulcan? Or is it me? This is not the time call for back up, or I'll shoot I'm sorry I've worked so hard on the supplies but we've lost more than half our people we didn't lose that many lucky that you found out soon enough That rotting old fuck! I'm going to send him a big gift Don't be rash I've re-established contact with Myanmar I think I can get you a new batch of ephedrine I've heard that madame cheong was known as the goddess of the golden triangle when she was younger is she still a looker? She had this title because she was ruthless how else do you think a woman can be come the biggest broker in Thailand? When I met you after you returned I thought you wanted to be a law abiding citizen but now you've connected me to madame cheong you destroyed tempest's lab and didn't get killed I'm starting to think that I've underestimated you This way please This is some heavy shit "oh great Buddha, form itself is emptiness; Emptiness itself is form" look not at what is contrary to propriety See not at what is contrary to propriety Welcome first time at this type of shop? Don't worry, my girls don't bite I'm just surprised that madame cheong speaks such beautiful cantonese you're a sweet talker come, let's talk outside Did you bring hand sanitizer? - Let's have some tea. - Cheers That's great, we speak the same language I love working with comrades everything's easier negotiating with family are we talking business already? You're uncle vulcan from the fuyu family, a vip since you're in Thailand, I have to host you stay here for dinner tonight okay I'll send two girls up to your room after dinner your girls are bit... too quiet I'm old, il prefer more lively women I can't talk back at you But you know, business is tough nowadays you're in the meth business then why are you here talking to a heroin broker? My meth supply is currently unstable we are intermediary traders, maybe we can try heroin I know, you killed the guy from wa state I'm telling you this because we're getting along so well I also hate those guys from wa state they're opening up meth labs in Thailand That's why I... And you are? Hello madame cheong, I'm rain fuyu it's really you I'm losing my memory with age I remember meeting you once when the Don was still alive sorry, I'll get this fixed up come on, let's clean it up, sorry You fuckers dare shoot me? Moba... Moba... We went through with this rescue mission to apologize to the tung's of the wa state we hope that Mr. tung can appreciate our sincerity let's maintain our existing relationship my uncle did business with you all these years, not me but you didn't see him as a partner you treated him as a king to an ant and eradicated him how can I be sure that you won't do the same to me when I become more powerful? Ms. tung, your uncle did not follow the rules that day I had to protect my interests as a leader, I'm sure you can understand the tungs produce the highest quality meth in Asia but you couldn't get it out of the golden triangle and I have the biggest clients in the world if both of our parties work exclusively with each other the weak will be eliminated within a few years, you'll be the only meth supplier in the golden triangle and we will be the brokers with the highest quality product I was kidnapped for three years my people couldn't find me but you were able to rescue me this was all god's plan the tungs from wa state had the gift of producing meth but we were forced to leave our home this was also god's plan whether we can work together let's see what the gods have to say You and I are both gifted that's why god connected us both wishing for us to work together that sleazy bastard out there is not worthy god is using my mouth to announce his plans my word is the god's word Ritual complete You're awake? I prepared a present for you What do you think? You like it? Surprise! This is my gift for you it's not what you think I was getting ephedrine for you from Thailand but I bumped into uncle vulcan, I... You were the only person I trusted why did it have to be you? Why did it have to be you? Why you? Why did you lie to me? Why? Why did you lie to me? Rain will never hurt tempest Sorry Rain will never hurt tempest I am senior inspector Hong from the narcotics bureau do you know this person? His name is fung, we were together back at the academy Rain because of you I've hidden all of the Don' incriminating evidence This is han Mei, she's been missing for a week do you know where she is? She an undercover I've placed near Mr. yim tell me what happened to her Take a look at yourself do you think you're worth of him? Remember, you owe him and you owe me if you don't want to repay this debt and let all of his work go to waste you can abandon the mission I will finish this not just for him, but also for myself I've set up a network in Thailand with uncle vulcan this time, I'm in charge of import and export in two weeks time, I can... I don't have that much time you said that you're in charge so you're directly in touch with all the buyers of this shipment? Yes Why are you so nervous? We'll drink when everyone gets here This is vulcan, this is... My last name is chung I didn't expect the person who gave us madame cheong would be such a beauty thank you very much Ms. fuyu helped me out in the past I'm just returning a favor I didn't expect the return to be so high and also the opportunity to work with uncle vulcan no wonder Ms. chung has a familiar scent turns out we're both great investors I only like doing business with the elite just because you said that, I'll give you 15% off thank you uncle vulcan, I've brought the cash no rush, have a bite first. Waiter... - What would you like? - Hot coffee please - have some food. - I've eaten already Ms. fuyu, are you feeling unwell? No, I might've drank too much, excuse me Every cop has a a disgusting odour every cop has a a disgusting odour Are we going to be exposed? Fung! Fung! Fung! Fung! Rain You took a shot? How much did you take? It's so noisy it's so noisy rain, just ignore them they'll shut up soon look at me, rain don't close your eyes don't close your eyes look at me look at me it'll be okay How did you get these? Sometimes I cut myself when I'm hallucinating to keep myself awake what about these? There was a point in time I thought that I was someone else just a very ordinary girl but she had a heavy drug addiction nothing would matter as long as she got her fix each time I woke up and saw myself I thought I was ugly I was revolting just like this one here, I wante to draw a smile but I dunno why it turned out like that Also right here All this that you're doing is it for someone important? This person doesn't exist anymore Uncle vulcan, the shipment from Myanmar has arrived Tempest, our shipment has a buyer now Students this is my eldest daughter rain from the moment she was born I've been teaching her everything I knew finally, she became my continuation and became a perfect creation but I was too complacent and forgot that when you're in posession of a perfect creation it's natural that a thief would want to steal it greet the Don Don miss Let me help He wasn't only a thief but was also a mole that was sent to destroy me What are you doing? Let go of me when I saw my tainted creation I kept asking myself if there's any way to fix it so I injected the meth that she made back into her body Maybe with this, she can finally feel my pain and become my continuation once again She should've died, and the story should've ended but I lived, and here's the rest of the story Uncle vulcan couldn't bear to watch me die he hid me in a mental hospital in Thailand I've tried committing suicide but I was stopped every time until I had a chance to escape and started being addicted to meth the three of us lived a happy life in that world then I started taking more and even in that happy world I started to wallow in pain until uncle vulcan came looking for me so I hid myself in a rehab clinic years passed without me even noticing until a month ago, inspector Hong came to me with fung's intel and so I became her mole on the inside I only have one objective in life for you to have a taste of what it's like to lose everything I want you to watch your empire crumble before you die the story needs to continue but this isn't your story at that moment, I've discovered the materials for my new creation I will implement a completely different method I won't teach her anything I'll only ask her questions I'l let her discover answers for herself at the end, she will inherit it all and become my most perfect creation this creation is named... snow I planted her as a mole by your side since day one that's why your plan was destined for failure so I've used this failed creation to finish my newest creation Goodbye That the city of mirages, would be wiped out by the wind, and exiled from the memory of men, and that everything written on the parchments, since time immemorial and forever more, was unrepeatable... Alright, we'll continue next time You might blind yourself from reading under the sun I'm used to it, it helps me focus It's such a thick book, isn't it boring? No, what's the point in reading simple stories? "Cien anos de soledad" you're reading the original text? I couldn't even finish the Chinese translation you must be quite something hey, can we go now? Here you go let me know the ending after you're done there was this letter with the housemaster but the envelope is dirty and I could only see 'rain' I wondered if it was for you I remember your name was rain? Thank you goodbye
