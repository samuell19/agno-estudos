You can't make it alone. Oi, Yamato, don't forget me. I'll help you too. This is the final battle. Let's go! Dragon - Check! Dragon - Check! Dragon - Fire! We will remember this! We will protect our planet! We are the Dragon-Four Fighters! How was it? - Good job. - I'll take it off. I'll take it off. - Good job. - That was hard work. Say, why can only Wataru-kun show his face? It makes me envious. I'm very sorry. However, the colour of a hero is red, isn't it? Red! A guy in pink like me is no good, huh? That's just not true. Delicious! What's this, what's this? What a great heart-emoticon! It's so big! I always communicate with this heart- emoticon. With whom? Not your business. Leader, Leader, hurry up and change clothes. Everyone's waiting! Oi, Wataru! Matsukata-san, hello. Are you producing a movie here? That's right. - You haven't changed at all. - Thanks. As usual, it went smoothly? Today I dealt out some blows again. I like your moves. Do your best! Thank you very much. - Matsukata-san, hello. - Hello. Nice to see you. - Park the car. - Okay. Well, we barely made it. Really? - I can't believe it. - It's true. Come on! Let's go! Come here. Build the formation! Dragon - Fire! Quickly! Go! Kick him! We are Dragon-Four! Thank you everyone! Come back tomorrow, okay! Thank you very much! Leader! There was a call from a producer at Toyo TV. He wants you to call him back. Outch! Outch... It's really painful. It hurts. Outch... - Yes? - Hi. It's me, it's me. Long time no see. Yeah. Are you doing fine? What happened? Well, are you sitting in front of the TV right now? Watching Dragon-Four? No, I'm not watching. I see. No, I'm lying. I watch it from time to time. What's that! So you watch it. I see, I see. By the way, today I got a call from the producer. He said they would make a movie of it and want me to play a new character in this movie. Really? I'll be a real actor, not just a stunt actor. So after a long time my face and name will appear on the screen again. Is your neck alright? My neck? My neck is no problem. Recently, I feel like my body became young again. What are you talking? No, I'm serious. It's what I always wished for. I'll do my best. Next is our pink dragon, Shoko-san. Pleased to meet you. All the persons we've introduced so far are heroes who also appear on the TV show. But this time we also have a new character, the black dragon, played by Ichinose Ryo-san. The black dragon was originally the red dragon who has changed over to the dark side. And then there is our commander, Tachibana Daikichi-san. Pleased to meet you. And the evil commander, Matsukura Masumi-san. Please to meet you. Well then, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you very much. - Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. And there is the stunt actor for the red and black dragon, Honjo Wataru-san. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. Well then, before we continue, Honjo-san, thanks for your hard work. It was nice to meet you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. Then, let's start with the beginning of the script. Director, Director, I have a question... Thanks for your hard work. Thanks for your hard work. Uchiyama-san. Uchiyama-san. One minute please. - Thanks for your hard work. - Thanks. Uchiyama-san, what's that supposed to mean? I'm very sorry. It was a decision at the top. But that's not what you told me. I will most certainly make up for it. I've really fought for you. Honjo-san, long time no see. You seem to be doing fine as always. Long time no see. Otani-kun, are you doing well? - I'm now the papa of two kids. - I see. You two know each other? Really, you should have told me earlier! Actually, he had his debut with our company. Right now, our Ichinose is in the audition for a Hollywood production. For Stanley Chan's next movie. Stanley Chan? He's filming in Japan? If he gets the role, it might be a big promotion. So if possible, could you give him some fight training before the shooting begins? Great idea! Well, that's alright. The other members are also here. Shall I introduce him? Sure. Please do. - Ryo-kun! - No... You were chewing gum earlier, right? Yes. Don't chew gum in front of other people. Is there a problem with that? You are playing a hero. If the hero makes masticatory movements with his mouth, the children will see it in their dreams. Was there a child present? What I'm talking about is how a hero should behave. Still, there was no child present. As I said... As long as there's no child around, it's no problem, right? There are even adults with the heart of a child! You shocked me. What's this? Good job. Don't you know the dragon fighting pose? Such a guy... Boss, thank you for your hard work. Oh, Johan! On the hero show in the amusement park last week you gave a good performance! I'm grateful for your words and will do my best to meet your expectations soon. Close the door. 1... 2... What is he doing? That's the green dragon, Morita. Morita! Morita! Hello. You are Ichinose Ryo-kun, right? In the flesh you look even more handsome than on television. - Hello. - Hello! Nice to meet you. By the way, Ryo-kun, do you have an insurance? Insurance? I mean life insurance, for example. Or health insurance. You may not have heard, but you can even insure single parts of your body. As usual, you're keen to sell insurance, huh? Misaki-chan. - Leader! - Yes. Who is this? In the upcoming movie he will play the black dragon, Ichinose Ryo-kun. Isn't that your role? No, there were some changes. I will do the stunts for the red and the black dragon. Hi. "Hi"? Was this just now perhaps a greeting? Yeah. What's that? A pigeon? A pigeon... Really, give me a break! Why did they decide for such a guy? It's not that I wanted to play it. With which agency are you? Star Garden. 100% patronage! He only got the role by push! What's wrong with you? Who are you talking to, little boy? You talk to much, bitch! You dare to call me bitch in front of all these people! You shitty little punk! I'll tear your guts out and strangle you with them! Let it be! Misaki, stop! - Stop with it! - I'm sorry! You don't interfere! Okay, get ready, everyone! Stop it now! Misaki, let's go! Some day he will disappear again so bear it. What's with these guys? 1... 2... This guy is really something special. Honjo-san is performing action since 25 years, after all. You will also have to try hard. Now, the audition for "Last Blade" will start. Omiya-san, Yasuda-san, Ichinose-san, please. Gentlemen, please go in. How was it? It went quite well. He said my English was good. I guess I will make it into the final. Sounds great. Does this chewing gum really work? Do you want some? No, thanks. Hollywood stars often chew gum to get white teeth. I see. You know, I have absolutely no motivation for this childish dragon movie now. It's just a distraction from my goal to play in a Hollywood movie. Well, I understand how you feel, but I think it's a good chance to practice action scenes and that's useful for you too. Can you take me to a convenience store? Yes. How's school? Are you having fun? Yeah, it's okay. Oh, right! Here, this is for you. Don Quixote? A tale? From time to time try to read a book. No, I hate reading. I told you to call the manager! Can't you even call the manager? Can't you do anything! Huh? - I'm really... - Huh? - I'm really very sorry. - Tell him to come her at once! Dad, this incident, leave it to the people of this shop. If you interfere, it will only cause trouble. But such a guy shouldn't be forgiven. No, leave him alone. Come on, dad, let's eat! This is delicious. What were you thinking when you served this? Give me an explanation, Okamoto-san! I'm very sorry Explain to me what you were thinking when you served this, Okamoto-san. Don't worry. It's alright. Here, drink some water. Can you tell me what you were thinking? Tell me what you were thinking when you served me this cold meat, Okamoto-san! I'm very sorry. Who are you? What happened? - That's none of your business! - It is my business! I'm a guest here and your loud voice disturbs the other guests. Besides, you didn't give the other person a chance to speak even a single word. In your heart, there is no justice. What a nonsense are you talking? Are you a bit strange in the head? The one who's strange in the head is you. What did you say, bastard! Stop it please! I'm going to call the police. It's embarrassing. Let's go home quickly. Say, sometimes you talk about me at home, right? Well, grandma sometimes does. "Even if his wife were dying of pneumonia, he wouldn't come home, that stupid man", she says. Thank you! I love you, Dad. It's alright, it's alright. You've been casted for a movie, right? Yeah, but there's been a change. Another guy gets my role. Oh, I see. Who is it? His name is Ichinose Ryo. That's not true. Ichinose Ryo? Really? He's super-popular presently! Can you get me his autograph? Ayumi, you shouldn't be a fan of that guy. Why? As an actor, he's second-rate. And what's more important, he has not the heart of an actor. Why do you say that, Dad? You're not an actor. Sorry for letting you wait. Thanks. You're naive. I'll show you my true power. Dragon - Check! Okay! We have it. Next, we'll shoot the jump scene! - Good job. - Good job. Your pose was not quite right. I have an excellent stuntman who will fix it up for me. Good luck. Give me a lunch box too. Okay. We have meat or fish. Then, meat, and fish, and meat. Typical for an idol, huh! Excuse me. Okay... start! Hollywood is something different, isn't it? Just the preparation of the scene costs as much as a complete film in Japan. No. Because it's Japan (Nihon), it's 2 films (ni hon = 2 fingers). Reina-chan, you want to become an actress, so you will like to see the set, right? I don't know much about it, but Hollywood films can be seen all over the world, right? American movies are absolutely great, aren't they? Don't take pictures here. - Ishibashi-san. - Yes? Director Chan is calling for you. I see. Wataru-chan, this won't do. Wataru-kun, your face was visible. My face was visible? Really? - Check it, check it. - It's bad, isn't it? Sorry. Once more. - Get ready for a 2nd shoot! - I'm sorry. - One more time! - Okay, make the preparations! We shoot it once more! Ready... action! How was it, my motorcycle stunt? Well, the bike was good, but can you do the action scenes? No problem at all. I've studied a lot of videos. Self-study is very good, but shouldn't you ask Honjo-san for advice? Give me a break! He's only a stuntman. Take it. I'm sorry. Oi, what are you doing? - Sorry. - I'm not talking to you. I mean you. What do you want from me? You just threw the close-up device to the floor. What close-up device? It contains a camera for close-up takes. Don't you know such things? What should we do if it was damaged, idiot? Make another one, I'd say. Idiot! Do you know how much this costs? 30 - 40,000 yen, I guess. Is not about the money. I'm talking of those many hours she worked on this wristband! It's alright. - Idiot! - That's your job after all, isn't it? What did you say! You bastard! Sorry. We caused trouble for you. It's okay! If Ryo-kun had been injured, filming would stop, wouldn't it? So I'm a kind of benefactor. What benefactor? Oi, Oi, give me a break! A person who protects the fighter against evil is a benefactor. - Right, Kadowaki-san? - Yes. I think someone should properly show him around on the set. We would be glad if someone did that, right? Well, I guess there's no one more qualified than me. Oi, make a "Peace" sign. - I'm leaving. - You don't want? I'm not interested in such things. Oi, Ryo! Leave it to me please. Ryo-kun, what do you think of "Resident Evil"? I've seen episodes 1 and 2. That's the movie version. What I'm talking about is the original playstation game. Don't know. "Don't know", he says. Do you know what you've missed in life if you've never played this game? Then, "Love Season"? What are you driving at? Start! Okay! 1... 2... What is this? Motion capture. It's used to create the movements of the game characters. Millions of gamers all over the world will play "Leader of the Samurai". It's going to be great! Battle over! He apologized, but somehow he couldn't clearly say "sorry". So we both had the same uneasy feeling. As if you had lost from the beginning. No, no, not a feeling as if we had lost... Not like a defeat... Sorry for letting you wait. Here's your deep-fried tofu. Enjoy the meal. Is this perhaps Ichinose Ryo-san? - Can you give me an autograph later? - You're wrong. You're mistaking me. I'm sorry. Manners means self-confidence and forgiveness. What's that? Bushido. ("The way of the warrior") If you want to impersonate a warrior, stick to the warrior's etiquette. Come on, write something. How come you have this on you? Doesn't matter. Do it! It's an exercise in giving people dreams. Write in your best handwriting. If you like, I'll introduce you to Ryo next time. Won't you sit together with us? Leave me alone, idiot! Honjo-san, do you enjoy your work? Yeah, it's quite rewarding. Somehow, if you work as stunt actor, your face and your name never appear, right? Well, those games you produce are interesting. But somehow it's frustrating, isn't it? Wanli Yikong! Life doesn't take place in broad daylight only. A man, even if no one sees him, even if no one knows him, should dedicate his life to the sake of someone. He must dedicate his life. Give me the bill. Okay. Thank you. Listen. Once I jumped from a 50 meters high steel tower 30 meters down in the course of an action scene. But, the only person who saw my face was the special effects guy. What are you saying! That hero movie has been broadcasted worldwide. Your legs struggling in the air will appear in the dreams of children all over the world. Oi, Ryo, you have a dream too, right? Not really. What's that, "Not really"? What I hate the most are such lame guys. You must have a dream! I have indeed. Then, what is it? Tell us. My dream is to get the Academy Award. Of course in America. And then, hold a speech there. What was that? For an idol, getting the Academy Award is impossible from the start. Impossible, impossible, no way, impossible. Fool. Ryo, that's not such a big dream. Do your best. I'm going to the toilet. It's quite late already. Okay, okay. Are you alright? I'll get you some water. That's all I need. Are you awake? Once he falls asleep he begins to talk. Here. - I'm off. - Have a nice day. Welcome. Hello. What's up? It's because of this. Ayumi wanted to have it at all costs and I just happened to be in the neighbourhood. Bye. Wait! Why do you put it there? Bring it here. Ayumi urged me to get it for her. What is it? A sketch? No, it's Ichinose Ryo's autograph. The movie... it's a pity, isn't it? Such things do happen all the time. Say, do you know this? A recently developed muscle relaxant. No, I don't know that. They say its healing power is completely different. Well, then I'll buy it. It's okay. Your health... is it really alright? If anything happens, contact me anytime. In case of a burglary or molestation. Whatever it is, okay? Here is no such thing. It's a peaceful neighbourhood. By the way, yesterday I noticed the lamp outside was broken. Thank you. I'll take care of it later. And... well... What is it? Hurry up and become happy. What? You of all people want me to be happy? Of course I do. Then, I'll go. Was anyone here? No, nobody. Was it perhaps Nishio-san? As I said, nobody was here. I bet that man bought a lot of medicine again. - Honjo-san. - Yes? Do you remember that matter recently? What matter recently? No, it's not important. Why are you always reading the script? - I guess it fits properly. - Yes. Well, I mean this scene has nothing to do with the red or black dragon. Seems you don't understand, huh? Without reading the complete script and knowing everything about the character you can't represent that person. You must get a feeling for how this character will act. But, it's a movie for children. No one will watch it so closely. The audience must grasp the character's personality. It doesn't matter if they're adults or children. - Muraishi-san. - Yes? Will it take any longer? I'm sorry. It seems about 30 minutes yet. Take off your clothes for a moment. Why that suddenly? Don't ask, take them off. Are you one of those guys? Fool! I'll show you... what action means. Look through the eye slits. Breath through the air slit. Next, the transformation pose! He's good at playing a hero. Show me what you've got! Are you okay? Difficult, isn't it? I don't want to be only a stuntman. And I didn't understand a word of what you said. I'm back. Oniichan (brother) is back. Don't always play games. Let's eat. Where did you buy it? At Torimaru's. - At Torimaru's? - At Torimaru's? I want to eat Yakiniku (grilled meat). Alright. I'll get it for you next week. Yeah, tea is okay. - Itadakimasu. - Itadakimasu. It's delicious! Don't come in here. Fool! Stop tickling me! Okay. It is as I say. The supermarket in front of the station does have Chinese fungus. Really? Then I'll call you again. Okay. Please do. How old are you now? I'm 38. What are your plans for the future? That story again? Do you want to stay a single mother forever? That would be a pity for Ayumi. Nishio-san isn't a bad man. If you don't grab this chance, it will vanish in the air forever. Stop it! Stop fighting against each other! Red dragon, you can't save this planet anymore. And isn't it good if mankind gets extinguished now? Good, isn't it! You're wrong. Totally wrong! There is no reason to extinguish all human life on Earth! You don't know the nature of humans. I'll show you my full power of destruction. Dragon - Check. Do it! Crush them! Cool! He's so handsome! Stop that! Keep quiet. Thanks for your hard work today, guys! Good job. - Good job. - Prepare the next scene! Ryo, Ryo! This is her. My daughter Ayumi. I'm Ayumi. Nice to meet you. - And I'm Horiguchi Noriko. - Hello. Allow me to say, you were just brilliant. And our birthdays differ by 1 day only. Yours is July 25, zodiac sign Lion, blood group 0, right? Mine is July 26, blood group A. - No... - A and 0 make such a great fit. Excuse me. Ryo-san, do you write on facebook? No, I don't. - Honjo-san, put on the wig! - Okay. Ryo-san, I'm so grateful for your autograph. Can you give me an autograph too? No, an autograph is a bit... Okay, I'll give you an autograph. Sorry for earlier. That was childish of you, wasn't it? Are you going home? Yes, that's my intention. Come with me. Is there a reason for that? You want to get the Academy Award, right? So you remember this! Look how much the staff work on the preparation of a movie. So what? It's important. Look over there! The gaffer's crew, the cameramen, the prop men, the sound engineers, and us, the actors. A movie is made by the joined efforts of them all. That's why you should have respect for the staff. That isn't it. What isn't it? I want to get to the top. I don't want to understand these things behind the scene. I want to learn how to play action scenes. Ryo, I can understand your feelings. But action is not done by one person alone. Action is team play! You first have to synchronize with your partners. Good morning. Do you have a minute? I just got the news it seems you qualified for the final selection for "Last Blade". Is that true? Great! And, Ishibashi is on the way to here right now. Really? It's a hero movie and the leading role is played by an idol. - Don't look around, hurry up! - Okay. Yes, that's okay. Huh? Ryo, what's wrong? - Director. - Yes? Can you let me play this scene? What? What's the idea, anyway? I want to try to do stunts. I want to play action scenes. Ryo, you're not yet capable for that. Director, can't you let me try one time? I'm confident that I can do it. - You can do it, can't you? - Yes. He can do it, right? - Kadowaki-kun. - Oh, hello. Sorry for asking you to come to this place. Ryo is working hard, I suppose. Reina-chan, don't eat too much now, okay? Just look at that. A sad sight, isn't it? But that's how Japanese action is. Hollywood action is something different. You're in the way! Watch out! Don't do that! It's dangerous! - It hurts! - Oi, Misaki, are you alright? - You, loose the rope! - Yes! Misaki-chan, are you okay? Slowly, slowly! Be careful. - Are you okay? - Yeah. From now on, confine yourself to be a dummy. I'm sorry. Really, you should leave action to the professionals. So, what shall we do now? What now? Oi, oi. I came here especially to see you so don't embarrass me. You should leave such things to a double. And anyway, what was that right now? Fluttering about like a moth. A Hollywood actor wouldn't do that. It's not the Hollywood way. Hey, you! Why do you belittle our action? This here is our set. People without manners go out please. Do you know who I am? At least not a warrior, right? Don't make fun of me. Such a behavior wouldn't be tolerated at my set. Never appear at my set. Ishibashi-san, I'm sorry. That guy is Honjo Wataru, right? Do you know him? - Is it still on the agenda? - Yes. Okay, let's go! Stop it. Get lost! Can't you hear? I told you not to come in here! Wait outside! You're hindering me! The both of you are a hindrance for me! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Yuta, Ko-chan. - Are you their brother? - Yes. [ A letter from their mother ] Excuse me... Excuse me... You're exhausted. Take a rest. I'm not exhausted. What do you want? In my current condition I will fail in the final selection for "Last Blade". Then I'd say you should give up. But, I mustn't fail in this audition. Finally I got this chance. I want to have success in Hollywood. For the sake of Yuta and Konatsu too. I heard it from Kadowaki-san. You are taking care of your little brother and sister, right? But there aren't just Hollywood movies. There are lots of studios in Japan. If I get the Academy Award, I want to dedicate my speech to my mother who's living somewhere in America. I'll tell her, "We don't hate you." "It was very hard that you never called us, but we all still love you." "We are alright." "And one day, we'll be together again." Honjo-san. Please teach me to perform action. I'm begging you. Don't underestimate action. It takes 3 years to get a good grasp of it. You can't master it so easily. It's no picnic! However, if you're truly resolved to learn, practice together with our group. Action is nothing for individualists. Action is for team players who watch their partners and anticipate their reactions. Do you understand? Yes. In case you have any wish, shouldn't you pray for it there? No, it's alright. And I have no coin with me. Here. That's for you. I'm begging you. I heard from the leader that you'd come to our place. But let me tell you, our training is damned hard! Yes. Well, the good thing is you can eat my home-cooked meals. - Right? - Yes. They all agree on that. Once you eat my Spanish paella with eggs and garlic, your fatigue disappears just like that. Misaki-san, you can cook? What did you say? I'm sorry to disappoint you. When you've tasted it, you'll get down on your knees and apologize. Right? - Yes. - Yes. Outch! You're too close! Sorry. That's nice. Thank you very much. Congratulations! Goro-san, who admires Steve McQueen, began his career as a member of the martial arts team Action-Stars. As the pink fighter in the serial "Cosmo Fighters" he had his debut as a stuntman. At this set he became acquainted with Honjo-san and the Hero Action Club. It's said that Goro-san gives the pink fighter more feminine charm than any women could do. And the pink colour was Goro-san's idea to make the character more cute. After the dissolution of the stunt team Action-Stars, he was invited by Honjo-san to become a member of the Hero Action Club where he is busy until today with special effects for movies and TV productions. During his 30 years of life in action he suffered 11 fractures, 53 sprains, and countless fall injuries and cuts. Goro-san, who is still very active is considered to be the most likely candidate to set a new record as Japan's oldest working stunt actor. Stunt actor Goro-san and your beautiful bride Shizuko-san, may your future life be always full of happiness. What oldest guy in Japan! It makes me laugh! I'll finish you off today! The girl is mine! Wait! Stop daydreaming, monster! Dragon - Check! - Sorry, we didn't make it in time! - Leader, you're in pink, right? Wait! Stop daydreaming, monster! Have you come back? Get lost again! This time it's for real. Dragon - Check. We are Dragon-Four! Get ready! The Dragon-Four Fighters have finally arrived. Will they be able to save the bride from abduction? Action! The person in the red dragon costume is the groom, Goro-san. Shizuko, Shizuko! Shizuko, I will protect you! I will make you happy for sure! Somehow it's nice, isn't it? As if they were all a family. What's that? You want to get married too? No, that's not what I mean. An idol wouldn't do that, right? Ladies and gentlemen, please give the couple a warm applause! Hold her! - Hurrah! - Hurrah! I'm alright. Fukunaga-san, thank you for taking care of him. Nonsense. Send him back to the set quickly. Yes. Well then, we will go home now. One... two... Thank you very much. - Are you alright? - Don't worry. Thank you very much! Thank you very much. Goodbye! - Hurrah! - Hurrah! That's great. Goro-san will be under her thumb, don't you think? Those two look so funny. - Well then, Ryo, - Yes? how about we visit a 3rd bar? Sorry, but it's time for me to go home. What's that? How can you go home now! I'm expecting a call from my manager. You are so cold, aren't you? The truth is, my little brother and sister are waiting at home for me. Then it can't be helped. Come! Sorry for letting you wait! Thank you. - Here's the squid. - Thank you. - Well, living alone in such a big house must be difficult. - Okay, okay, okay... I'll take some of the vegetables and the squid, okay? How nice! - Oi, Ryo! - Yes? - You have all sequels of 007, haven't you? - I think so. "Three Ships From Overseas"! Oi, Johan! Johan! Johan! - You are Mexican, right? - Yes. Earlier, the Japanese used to call you "people from the three ships". - Really? - It's true. - Didn't you know? - No, I didn't? Don't eat so much before the meal is served. I'm preparing my special paella just now. Okay! I'm very sorry. You know where your brother is hiding his porn DVDs, right? Show me, show me, show me! Found it! Don't take a photo of this! That's great! Run, run, run, run! Big news! Big news! Delete that! Delete it, I say! Oh, it's you, Kadowaki-san. Please come in. Ryo, it's decided. Last Blade, the cast has been decided. Now the future looks bright. Is that true? Ryo has got a Hollywood role. Well done, Ryo. Congratulations. Your brother did it! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Thank you very much. Ryo, that's great, isn't it? Yes. Let's all eat a lot today and celebrate! Thank you very much. Let's eat together! Okay, okay, okay... You? What happened? Good morning. Well, come in. No, this is far enough. Well, you see, when I was 26, you admitted me into your team, you promoted me, and you have really been a good leader. But, I can't continue any longer. I'm very sorry, but allow me to quit! Oi, wait a minute! Why do you want this so suddenly? Until today, I've always tried to gain people's attention with my action performance. It's true. But, when I saw Ryo-kun, I recognized. Between successful people and those who are not, there's a difference. What are you saying? Aren't you the green dragon fighter! Sorry. Yoshida has been practicing hard recently. Can't you let him do it? I know this is selfish, but I'd be grateful if you granted it. Hey! Is this really a good idea? Isn't it still too early for such a decision? So tell me, when is the right time for this decision? I used to believe if I continue my dream will come true one day, but aren't there dreams that can't be reached no matter how long you try? I think you are someone special. You can chase for your dream forever. You are our hero. But I... I'm sorry. Please have a look at the scene over there! This will change the history of action movies! What happened? Director Chan has not appeared on the set. It seems Fan Long suddenly came into conflict with the director. That's it. I'm leaving. See you. Looks like they want to delete all the Japan scenes. What can we do? I'm Ishibashi. Don't you remember me? We've met once before on a film set. I'm Ishibashi. Oh, you! What are you doing here? First, let's go out of here. I can't talk in here. Why? I have just come in. I see. Alright. Then, let us talk here. Let's relax for a moment. Well, actually... - Really? - Yes. Fan Long declined? - The Fan Long? - Yes. Fan Long came to Japan, ate sushi, and travelled back. That's why Director Chan wants you, Honjo-san, to play the most important scene, the climax of the film. Can you fulfill his request? Honjo-san, indeed, it's a dangerous stunt. However, nobody has ever done this before. Honjo-san, that's action that only you can perform. Please do it. I'm begging you. There are no stunt actors in Japan. Dad, you're not an actor. Aren't there dreams that can't be reached no matter how long you try? I want to have success in Hollywood. For the sake of Yuta and Konatsu too. Finally I got this chance. Rinko! Rinko! Rinko! - Rinko! - What's wrong? - Oh, Rinko! - It's 500 yen. It's 500 yen. Rinko! Oi! - It has happened! - What? - It has happened! - What has happened? I'm in a Stanley Chan movie! Stanley Chan? Really? Really! Is that really true? - Here. Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - It's really true! This time it's for real. The date for the shot has already been decided. That's great, isn't it? Congratulations. I did it! So, what's your role? A kind of immortal ninja. He meets with the protagonist and his buddies for the last fight. Your dream came true, didn't it? What are you saying? It's our dream! At any rate, it's a fantastic movie. This time, it's action without CG (Computer Generated effects). If it's without CG, they'll use wires, right? No, they don't. Neither wires nor CG. That's why Fan Long became scared and returned to Hong Kong. And now I got the role! Are you crazy? You take on such a dangerous job? Your neck won't heal anymore. You've seen the X-rays, haven't you? It's a wonder that you're so well. No, Rinko, I... Do you plan to live in the Warring States period forever? Listen, I hate all that film-craziness of yours! You always do only as you please and cause worries for others. Get lost now! If you absolutely want to do the stunt, then do it! And if you kick the bucket, I don't care! Don't make me say such things. There's not enough time for the preparation. Those guys are only keen on that action scene. No matter what happens to us. We'd better stop the leader. Well, I have tried to stop him. But the leader said he wanted to show them Japanese action. I guess I can comprehend his feelings. He wanted to see his name and his face on the big screen one day. He wanted to perform a sensational action scene. That's what he thought when he embarked on this job. Because he's so dumb to believe his dream would certainly come true one day! Just like me, right? Just as we all. Ryo-kun. Yes? Do you think we can meet this producer Ishibashi? Yes, this is Honjo. I'm not at home. Please leave a message now. Hello. This is Rinko. I know very well what you feel. But I'm sure you'll get another chance. Give up this job. I have a bad feeling. - Honjo-san. - Yes? There's something we have to explain. Yes? - Alright. - He says that's alright. Oh, right. Excuse me. This place here... how big is it approximately? - You mean its wideness? - Yes. Understood. - Is that alright? - I can see it here. Thank you very much. Ryo! What's wrong? Honjo-san, in case you've accepted this job for my sake, can't you quit it? Don't get a wrong idea. I'm doing it for my own sake. When I was young, my body was weak. Mom and dad were worried about me. Our home was always full of protecting charms. I guess that's why I admired Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee is my hero. I wanted to be like Bruce Lee, so I entered this world. Karate, Shaolin Kung Fu, Aikido, Jeet Kune Do, I did them all. Each day I practiced until I collapsed. I guess it must have been annoying for Rinko. But it was to no avail. In Japan, action actors are all only stuntmen. None of them became a Bruce Lee. Honjo-san, you're absolutely amazing already. I know. I know that! But, just like Bruce Lee is my hero, I want to become someone's hero too. If I don't do it... If I don't do it, no one is still going to believe! In the dream of action. Ryo. You must become someone's hero too. Honjo-san, this way please. Good evening. Finally I managed to invite you to dinner, Rinko-san. It's a pleasure. I see. Rinko-san, you do a lot of sports, don't you? Yes. Myself, I often go to play golf. I'm more on the golf course than in the office. Well, my work can be done everywhere, can't it? Speaking of it, your property also has development potential. If you use the land of the pharmacy as collateral, take a loan, and erect a building, you will make a considerable profit. In other words, you'll rake in an excellent return without having to work. Honjo-san, sorry for letting you wait. Please. Most Japanese people just don't use their head, don't you think? What do you mean? No, I'm not saying this to sneer at you. For example, let's say the margin of the pharmacy is 20% of the unit price. Then, no matter how hard you work, your margin doesn't increase, right? Therefore, it would be better to change it into something more profitable. But, what will become of the people who need medication? In the neighbourhood there are older people who can't walk far distances. That's something the public welfare people should consider. Instead of racking my brain about such a matter, I would rather use my head to consider how to make the best use of that property. In that case, I... prefer to be a fool. Nishio-san, could you put your life on the line at work? What do you mean? Bushido means living in the knowledge of death. Excuse me. Thanks for your hard work. Aren't you Rinko-san? Morita! I'm sorry, Leader. I... I always strike down others. Once in a while, I want to be struck down myself. Swing it to strike me down! Yes! Honjo-san, if you would please. Stand by, he needs a little more time. What's wrong? You're the legendary stuntman! What's wrong? He's concentrating. Leader! Go! You're okay, right? Please stand up! Do you want to die in a place like this? There's still something we have to do! Stand up, bastard! Well, Manabe-san, your sound effects were pretty powerful today. Yeah, if I'm possessed by the God of Drama, my potential is unlimited. That's right. Looking at this, no doctor would say that Honjo-san can continue with his current occupation. It's as you say, Sensei. I've also told him countless times that I wanted him to quit. But I've given that up now. That's why I will control him from now on. I will stay by his side. Forever. Is that alright? Oh, Rinko! Rinko, I'm fine, aren't I? Look, look! See this, see this? Don't be silly. I can do sit-ups. Let it be! Sit-ups are okay. I can't do the other stuff, but sit-ups are okay. Let it be! Look at this. - Dad! - You're really a fool! There are many capricious actors and producers in Hollywood and this can ruin the movie.
