♪ [ Bugle Call ] [ Explosions ] [ Horse Blusters ] Corporal! - [ Man ] No sign of life? - No, sir. Nothin'. Just the old woman and the dog. What was she doing there? Dyin'. And nothing else? No people, no animals? No, sir. Same thing as we found at El Morro and Red Lake. Three Navajo villages deserted, suddenly. Just picked up. You said there were no tracks? Nowhere I been. Just this, Major. The sand painting. Yes, sir. The body of a man, the head of an animal. It was wearing that army coat. That lance was run right into it. I thought they were finished. I thought the army saw to that. [ Wind Whistling ] Major? Sir, about these patrols. There ain't a man on this post don't know we're riding out of here under strength. With those scouts and fresh troops overdue from Fort Stanton-- Well, they're tight. [ Sawing ] Sergeant? Yes, sir. [ Man ] Come on! Ain't got all day to get these things built. Uh, one pick. Major Harkness, any word on those supplies yet? None.Huh. What can I get you, Major Harkness? Mr. Barrows, I want to see lightning. [ Coin Clattering ] Uh, sack of 56-50's. Three pounds of hardtack. Mm-mmm. Not this time. What do you know about our Navajo? - What do you want to know? - They're deserting their villages. Moving up to Chao Mesa. 2,000 of them. Two pounds of bacon. - I want to know why. - Ask 'em. I had in mind you might do that for me. Chao Mesa? Me? - That's it. - [ Chuckles ] No. Army ain't got my name on no papers no more. I come and go where I please. There isn't anyone going much of anywhere, Ben, if those Navajo are putting on war paint. Climb around those rocks, gettin' my tail shot off just to find out what they're up to? Is that what you want? Sugar and salt. Movin' out. That's it. Catch the first herd north to Oregon. That's the way to put it. Really gonna do it. Find that little spread of buffalo grass. A woman. Kids. Now you know me. Here's mud. Uh... yeah. Let me have a saddle pad. If you can find something to put it on. I got a horse. Army horse. Apache got yours. I wish I could sell you one, Ben, but we're short on remounts. - Mr. Barrows-- - Is closed for inventory. It's a pretty long walk to the Navajo. Take my sorrel. And if you head for Oregon--That could happen. Remember, stealing an army horse is a hangin' offense. You underhanded, double-dealing son-- Now you know me. [ Door Closes ] [ Gunfire, Shots Ricocheting ][ Men Yelling ] [ Gunfire Continues ] [ Men Whooping ] Pull 'em in there! Come on! Hyah! Pull those wagons in! [ Shouting Continues ] [ Whooping ] All right! Get those wagons in! [ Whooping Continues ] Come on out! Come on! [ Gunshots ] Come on! Come out! What the hell are you shooting at, boy? What the hell do you think, German? You're wasting ammunition. Don't. All men remain armed without neglect. Maintain your positions. We are the superior force. What about water, Captain Buckley? We'll dig for water. Four men on shovels. Two-hour shifts. The rest stand guard. Stores will be apportioned. Women and children on quarter rations. Men on less. Why don't we send out a search party and look for the fort? We don't have a sufficient force to spare a party. You said it's west. Maybe one man-- Trying to get a sense of direction at night in the open desert, target for those savages? I have no doubt as to his end, Mr. Lynde. But--Nor do I have any doubt as to your obedience. Tomorrow we'll make plans. Tonight we have to set a watch. Captain Buckley. The only thing these Indians want is your horse as tribute. I do not negotiate with those who would rob me. All these people here will die if you don't. Not as long as I have a man left to pull a trigger, Mr. Raeder. No, sir. The buzzards will not feed off this party. [ Spits ] [ Woman ] Garratt. We're not gonna make it. Oh, we're gonna.Oh, Captain Buckley. He'll get us out. You'll see. Get us buried in them holes we've been diggin' for water. I'm gonna get you an extra ration of food. I'll ask him. From now on, you have mine.Garratt. Hush, honey.We gotta try and make it to that fort. Heller.We've got to! Honey, we'll die out there.We'll die here. Every time we try to move, they just drive us back. They don't need to kill us. We're doing it all to ourselves. Stop talking like that. I ain't gonna listen. Mr. Raeder-- he knows. Well, there ain't no one dead yet. Raeder. He knows nothin'. Garratt--You stop talking stupid. Captain? Corporal Chaffee commanding. Reconnoiter Correo area. Work back around Valverde. I'll talk to Chaffee when he gets back. Major Harkness. Sir, if I had 2,000 neighbors rattling lances, I wouldn't send out five-man patrols. I'd make this garrison defensible. How would you do that? Sir? Seventy-seven men, an ammunition inventory that's not promising, decayed walls, situated on low ground. It'd take months to make this fort defensible. Till we get that detachment from Fort Stanton, sir, we are powerless to make an aggressive fight. Then we prevent it, MacDowell. You don't stop a fire out here once it gets started. You keep it from happening.With five-man patrols, sir? - Five is what we've got. - Sir, I was adjutant at Fort Reilly for two years. You've been my adjutant for two months, long enough to know this isn't Kansas. Post your watch. Single sentries on every wall. Two-man local patrol, mounted. If anything moves or breathes, I want to know about it. Yes, sir.Sir! Captain MacDowell, sir! Captain MacDowell, sir! At Las Lunas Canyon, sir. I think I saw smoke. Over there. They're dust devils. I've seen thousands of 'em in Kansas. Yes, sir. [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Gasps ] [ Panting ] They're gonna die. You and I see that. Please help me. Go back. The patrol goes out.But he knows if we don't have reinforcements-- The major says the patrol goes out. Well, it's the dead I could always prescribe for rightly. Is that what you think you're going to be doing here, Doctor? I'm just asking. The Spaniards were more afraid of the Navajo than they were the Apache. What beat them then? The war. The government couldn't stand the harassment, so it sent in the army under Kit Carson... in '64. Two years ago. [ Chuckles ] That's recent enough to remember how to mount an attack, isn't it? Do you know what the Navajo could do here with that trail to feed on? And this fort the only law and protection for 500 miles? Is that why they're gathering? You think that's what they're after? I don't know what they're after. I'd like to find the genius who picked the site for this fort. You could hide a thousand Indians behind those rocks. Have to patrol it 24 hours a day. What are you doing out here? What I was sent here for: to keep peace and the way west open. How, if I might ask? Maintain order by your own plan of action. [ Chuckles ] Well, that shouldn't be too hard. With your Indians and all the desperate, angry people... pouring through here, heading west, half of them hating themselves, and the other half hating each other, all of them running away from something-- mostly from a war that nobody wanted. You never saw the old Navajo stronghold, did you? We plowed them under. We gutted them, made beggars out of them, left them nothing except angry memories. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my boy out here. - What do you mean? - This came three weeks ago. "Inman Academy. Dulwich, Connecticut." Office of the headmaster. He's had Peter in there three times this term. The last time, they caned him. For what? [ Sighs ] Insubordination, disrespect, leaving campus without permission. That's not bad for a 12-year-old boy. Not bad for Ulysses S. Grant. The last time, they brought him in drunk.[ Laughing ] I don't know what I'm gonna do with him out here, George. Primitive living, disease, isolation, hostiles. Well, it's not the best place in the world, but... try and find that back in New England. Corporal of the guard! The main gate! [ Horse Whinnies ] - Mr. Lynde. - No. Please, no. Please don't go out there. Lots were drawn. It's been decided. All they want is the horse. Then we're free to go. [ Horse Whinnying ] [ Whinnying ] [ Gunshots ] There was valor in this, Mr. Lynde. That was not what we planned! I would say I felt a joyous exultation. A longed-for action to occupy my attention. I would say I have seldom enjoyed an encounter more in my life. Help! Let go! Let go! Help! Turn that one over, Sergeant. Boys. Only three. Raeder said there were five. All of them just boys. Well, they're in their proper repose, if you ask me, sir. Ain't no friend of 'em. Less than you think, Sergeant. They're not Navajo. They're Kiowa. Kiowa? They're Oklahoma. Strictly Oklahoma. They don't just cut a man's throat. They cut off his hands, then peel off his skin. They'll take a whole day if they're in a hurry. I'll get a detail, sir. We'll bury 'em. No one will find 'em. Bury the two that got over the rim. Very good. Take him to the wagon. Nothing, sir. No sign of the girl? Raeder said he left her two miles west of the canyon. That's mighty big country. Head back out. Work a corridor, half a mile wide.Yes, sir. At one time in my life I have dreamed that I might one day fight with such men. Sergeant Boyd. Get those wagons ready to trail. We're moving into the fort. Major, I protest. We've been through ordeal. Half an hour, Sergeant. - Move 'em out. - Yes, sir. Major, your command does not prevail over my people! Any man who resists, chain him. Yes, sir. All right! Move 'em out! Post number one. Rider approaching the main gate. [ Chatters ] Whoa. That patrol came in an hour ago. That gave this one up for dead. She's on her way. [ Grunts ] Heller? Why'd you go? Mr. Buckley said we'd never find you. Young man, you want to help, you wait outside, would you, please? You all right?Yeah, Doc. I think Harkness wants to see you. Something's happening. All right. [ Whispers ] Bucholz. Bucholz? [ Door Closes ] I count some axles bust, some wheel rims lost. Your smith could help while he's resting. We're most done in on stores-- flour, bacon, coffee, salt, molasses, dried fruit, if you've any. Injuries are minor. Hard work, vittles, sleep-- that's the tonic. We could trail out of here most likely day after tomorrow. And a resupply of ammunition. Where do you think you're gonna get all that? Here at the fort. You have stores. We're in short supply. We have barely enough for our own. You can't mean that. Can't I? How did you get these people to follow you anywhere, Buckley? Well, now, I can answer that. Some advertise in newspapers, don't you see, inviting emigrants to meet and organize. It's what I did in an outfitting town. When did you leave Independence?September. Two months late. No chance to beat the snow. Cutting down on the nooning hour, making 20 miles a day instead of 14. Heading overland with seven wagons. Seven's enough for supply and defense. Twenty is barely enough for supply and defense. - Companies vary. - You have no outriders, no hunters, no scout. I demand the highest conduct from my people. Disciplined, resourceful, one man knowing his trail. The east-west trail goes through this fort. You were 10 miles off trail and boxed in. By savages! Three of which, I must remind you, that we saved the army the trouble of killing. Out to massacre 20 people. Out for tribute. You were told that. I do not negotiate. You negotiate, Buckley. It's the way you keep the Indian from exploding. I do not intend to crawl and squirm in corners... from savages that don't know strategy or tactics. I do not like that picture, Major! There are no Kiowa Napoleons! Sir, sentry reports Indians a quarter mile out. ♪ [ Bugle Call ] Single sentries, Captain, on every wall. Sir, I'm not satisfied. Captain, in a command like this, everyone cannot be satisfied. Yes, sir. Single sentries! Man your posts! Spooky, ain't he? Satanta. [ Harkness ] He'll lie, cheat, steal, kidnap, kill. No one trusts him, and he trusts no one. What's he after down here? Warriors. He called a war council of the Navajo. He's been up on Chao Mesa for three days. They think he's big medicine.How far'd he get? Not that far, not yet. What stopped him?He came down to pick up his dead. You mean those boys Buckley killed are his people? Young braves out to win their first feather. And he wants who killed 'em. An eye for an eye. And if those Navajo just think he can get away with it-- But that can't happen. That's just a handful of renegade Kiowas. But if it did happen? [ Ben ] That's all those Navajo need to see. They'll come off those rocks, all 2,000 of 'em, and they won't leave you heads to bury. It can happen. [ Wind Howling ] Heller. Honey. Hey, you know? Captain Buckley, he's sure shapin' things up. Y-You ought to see the way he does. And you know, those wagons, they ain't nearly so battered as we thought. And ours, honey-- Ours hardly nothin'. Broke a spoke in a wheel. Yeah, we'll be, uh, tradin' the whole train out, I think, day or day after. Yeah. Been talkin' to the captain. And, uh, he says-- Know what he says? He says, "The best land in California's the San Joaquin." We-- We can plant or raise hogs or chickens. Both even. And, you know, this side of a year, we're gonna have that piano I promised you-- I'm not goin' to California, Garratt. I'm not going with you.Honey, I don't want to hear nothin' like that. You go. You and the captain. You need me. Don't you understand common language anymore? I'm not going with ya. I don't wanna have nothin' more to do with you. I wanna go home. All right. Well, then the whole game's up, isn't it? I believed you, Garratt. I believed you when you told me you'd take care of me. Oh. I only made up my mind to go with you to help you along. Well, it's a time to tell me that. All right. I don't want you with me. Now, that's dead straight. You go out and find yourself some trooper. You think I ain't been noticed? I don't have to ask. [ Door Opens, Closes ] Corporal of the guard! Post number one! You're from Fort Stanton?Yes, sir. Where's my detachment? Sir, I'm just freighting this up to Colonel Jones at Fort Baker. Four companies of cavalry! Five scouts! Where are they? Colonel Anderson said to tell you, Major Harkness, sir, he can't spare them. He said three months. I have all the new circulars, sir. "Salt Pork and Its Uses," "Numbering and Lettering of Haversacks." I have wanted posters--There's the way you run an army! You don't need troopers! You don't need supplies and ammunition! You fight it on circulars. I ask for men, and Jones gets whiskey and a bloody bugler boy! Major Harkness, sir, I think you'd better--Damn it! What? I think you'd better meet your son. You know, you can make a pretty fair fire out of possum fat, or a skunk. A dead skunk, of course, one who didn't have time to advertise. That's what we used when we ran out of coal oil. So you keep the wick low. Your mother could never understand why-- I already know what's in this. About the drinking, sir, or the playing around with girls? Sacked. Thrown out of school. I never did the drinking. That was Jenkins. Shipped off with a tag on your coat, packed off like a piece of freight. Well, we-- we'll talk about that-- Tell me about your trip. It was a quite a wind out there today, wasn't it? Did they feed you properly? See any buffalo? Traveling with soldiers. I'll bet they put a word or two in your vocabulary. Will I be sleeping here or in the barracks, sir? Peter, what happened? I've slept in barracks before. I don't mind. Peter.Yes, sir? Stop calling me "sir." Reverend Satterfield always said to call people "sir." Well, I am not Reverend Satterfield. You are done with Reverend Satterfield. It was just one of his rules, that's all. The only one you chose not to ignore, it would seem. Yes, sir. Well, you know. Peter. [ Sighs ] First thing in the morning, I'll tell you where we're going. Do you know how long it's been? It's four years since I've seen you. You look so much like your mother, it's-- She, uh, told me to save something for you. It's a Southern officer's sword. At Vicksburg, he gave it to me in surrender. I was gonna give it away, but... she said to save it for you. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see anything you've got in that box. Not the sword or anything! Disruptive in prayers. Sir. - Inattention in class. - Yes, sir. Insolent to the masters, cheating on examinations. Yes, sir! Fighting in the dormitory, playing the chapel organ at midnight, cribbing, smoking. - Yes! - Is that all you can say? - Yes? Yes what? - Yes, sir! There's soap by the basin. There's water in the pitcher. Major? I, uh-- I could have the cook rustle up some beans for the boy. Do that, Sergeant-Major. Oh, Marcy.Yes, sir? Tell the officer of the day I want to talk to Buckley and his people... tomorrow morning at 8:00, after assembly. And Cavalieri, MacDowell and the doctor. Right, sir. [ Chuckles ] "Stories for the Campfire." They're all good men, but not one can read sand. I need a man who can. You.Huh? Ben, I've got dreams as well as you. But dreams cost. Do you know the price of a small spread in Oregon? - No. - $200 a section. Brood stock and feed, food and supplies. Not counting what you have to have to get through the first winter. You don't even try it for less than 500. Stay or go. Just know what you want. How much am I wanted for, Ben? 600. You've been thinking what you might do with $600. After all, Ben, here you are at the top of your life, living that sordid... and obscure existence.[ Cocks Gun ] Last time I saw you, they were hanging a medal on you. What happened? There was a little farmhouse outside Chattanooga. Of no strategic value, but it was heavily fortified. We had a company commander who simply couldn't stand the thought... of having an unsecured objective on his name. So we were ordered to take it. And we tried. Three times we tried, and we finally did take it... with the last four men we had standing. I returned and I walked into his tent, and I put a bullet in his head. Where can you go? To the mountains, Ben. They're gonna catch up with you sooner or later. A bounty hunter, somebody. Well, Ben, better you than them if it has to happen. [ Hammer Releases ] Assembled and accounted for, sir. [ Horse Whinnies ] You have sustained considerable hardship. By the grace of God and the courage of one of your number, you're all here. Normally you'd be welcome to repair and recoup as long as you like. The situation is not normal. I must ask you to make what repairs you can today and tomorrow. The smithy will be available to you at any hour. So will the wheelwright. Present your requests to Lieutenant Cavalieri. Extraordinary and personal matters to Captain MacDowell. Need for medical attention to Captain Detroville, our surgeon. Be harnessed and ready for trail at 6:00 in the morning, day after tomorrow. A detachment will take you to Fort Stanton. Later on to Bent's Fort. Major? Fort Stanton. That's east. Back where we came from. And they can continue on from there back to Saint Louis. Well, no, sir, no. Good grass and water.It's 1,000 miles. - If that's what it takes. - You won't make 10. - We have made 500! - Not with Satanta as an escort. We have met the vaunted red man. We have prevailed. - Mr. Buckley-- - Captain! Captain Buckley! 2,000 Navajo are sitting up there in those rocks... waiting to see what's gonna happen to you. I bloody well will not get into a fight with them... because your scalp is hanging from some Kiowa's belt! [ Scoffs ] There is the way with this army! Sentimentalizing about its immortal souls. Cowards afraid to die, clinging to life at the sight of a sharp knife. Well, go east. Back to where you came from. Back where a man can't trust anything. To life without beginning or end. I want only strong people, with spirits that want to go soaring. People who wish to lift themselves out of the place into which they were born. Well, go back. Back where diminishing and dying begin, bankrupt in a filthy prison. There you will live forever, my dear friends. Paupers, without dreams or ideals. I go west... to better things. So go east. All of you, go with him! Present your requests! You are not fit to command men. Ride point for me to Fort Stanton, and I'll give you that sorrel with the blaze face. Forty-six hours, Captain. On their wagons, or tied to 'em. See to it they're gone. [ Door Opens ][ Harkness ] It was used at close range. [ Door Closes ] Some ways it was the hardest weapon to face. Could see it coming.Yes, sir. Peter, you're angry with me. No, sir. You know, half the men in my command think I'm too tough on 'em. But they're good men. Now, how am I to talk to you? What do I say? When Reverend Satterfield used to get mad, he'd say things in Latin. Um-- Omnia gallia... in tres partes divisa "ist." Est. I'm sorry? You're supposed to say "est," not"ist." I'll remember. How do you know Latin? You sent me your paper. Oh. I'm just finishing. Want to see it work? What is it? It's a navigational device for sailing. No more wind calculations. Look. I place this scale onto the star map. I'm gonna revolve the scale on the North Pole. On these scales I've worked out the circles of altitude and the lines of bearing. All I do is place it on a star... and revolve the scale till it's opposite those figures on the map underneath. And there you are, the ship's location. You must be well up in your mathematics. I never had a chance to try it out. Would that work in the desert? Would it?It's no different than the ocean. Sand instead of water. Stars are the same. We'll take ourselves out, cigars and a bottle of whiskey. If we can't find our way back with that, we don't know our business. I stole it. What? I stole the whole thing. I never invented it. Taverner did. I took it when he wasn't looking. Oh, Peter. I never did that Latin paper. I copied it. I'll teach you how an olla cools water. Latin's a dumb thing to have to learn anyway. I hated old Fosburgh who taught it. I used to go into his room at night and change all the grades on his papers. Wash your face and get your breakfast. I don't want it. There won't be anything more to eat until evening. I'm not hungry. I'm not gonna eat. You've had three weeks to rehearse what you were going to say to me. You've got something stuck in your craw, and I want to know what it is. You never cared about me. You never cared about my mother. Why didn't you let me stay with you after she died? Peter, I only care about one thing-- seeing you grow up with a chance for the future. Just so long as you don't have to have mearound. Well, around if it's possible, away from me if it's not. - You mean that dumb old school? - If that's the best place. The place could burn down for all you care.

Who gave you your orders?Captain MacDowell, sir. Those were his orders? To help out forward? No, sir.What were his orders? To hold our posts, sir. As assigned. Yes, sir. Are you aware of the 10 standing orders for sentries? Yes, sir. One of which is that you never, under any circumstances, leave your post? - Yes, sir. - Are you aware, because you left your post, the walls of this fort were breached? Yes, sir. Sergeant-Major.Yes, sir. Take 'em out.Left face. Forward, hup. Captain, bring the officers to attention. Sir? The officers will come to attention. Officers, ten-hut! - Mr. Cavalieri-- - Sir! Spit out that cigar. Why didn't they obey your orders, Captain? I don't understand the question, sir. You gave them orders. Why didn't they obey them? Because they didn't believe in you, Captain. Because you did not believe in me. When men do not believe in their officers, gentlemen, you see the results. Major, sir, I would hardly-- Responsibility accepted, Captain. It rests where it belongs-- with me, for remedial action. Lieutenant Lewis, double the guard. Take the men off construction. - Wrong. - Sir, I-- Starting now, every enlisted man, including the baker, tanner, smithy, cook, pulls double guard duty-- Four hours on, four off, four on. And his duty assignment, and construction, day and night. That's an 18-hour day, sir. It's only six hours sleep. Mr. Lewis, the officers of this command will be on duty 24 hours a day. We get no sleep. May I ask the purpose of this, sir? When my men see their officers stand to duty while they rest, they'll believe in you, Captain. About three days without sleep, and you'll believe me. Further questions? Got anything for red eyes, Doctor? Yes, sir. Tincture of dogwood. Officers at ease. Break out plenty. Major!What? They've taken the boy. He's gone. Man's got more guts than brains goin' out there. He's standing to his duty, Mr. Lawler. [ Speaking Foreign Language ] - Captain MacDowell. - Yes, sir!

My gun.Yup. Whoa. He wants you. I've got two days to turn you over to him, or my boy dies. You are pledged to fight to the last button on your coat, sir. Not palaver. I have no thought, I assure you, of being escorted to that heathen, or anywhere else. What were you, Buckley? A supply room sergeant with a thirst for command? You've never led men in your life. You've never led wagons, or soldiers, or settlers, not anywhere, except up that canyon. - Where's Lawler? - He's gone, Major. Took the sorrel and lit out. Take in a stray dog like that, you're likely to get bit. Hyah! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Brr. I'm cold. Can I, uh-- Can I sit here and, uh, talk to you for a while? Yeah, of course. I mean, you know-- Garratt--I'm taking you home, Heller. - Is that what you want? - What? Don't you? I don't know. When we get someplace, we'll buy tickets back. And I'll explain to your pa.That'll make him happy. Well, now listen. I ain't after makin' him happy. It's you. - Oh, Garratt. - Ah. I come on like I was a millionaire. Treasurer of the company. I was gonna throw the West wild, the way I toss my feet. Well, all over. Well, I didn't help any. Garratt, I don't want to go home. I want to make one. Well, now listen. Now, we start with nothin'.

They've got him up on top of this spire. A hundred feet up in the air. How'd you find him?I got lucky. There was fresh snow. Four Kiowa guarding the base. Another up on the ledge with him. How'd they get up?By rope. But they've pulled it up. Can we get up? I don't know. Even without the guards. Most of it's near straight up. Take a mountain lion for that. I think maybe I got you one. You're a damn fool, Lawler, thinking friendship rewards. So I'll help you find the boy, you forget about the poster. That's the offer. $600 is a lot of money. That boy must mean a hell of a lot to you. Don't even know him. But Major Harkness you know. When Cavalieri gets the settlers to Fort Stanton, have him give this to Colonel Jones. They can tell their side of the story. He can tell ours if he's asked. What can I do, sir?Get 'em off by morning. I was referring to you, Major. I'll need your position. - You're not yourself. - You have your orders. If you're not back by morning, Major, I'm sending out a search patrol. You will not, MacDowell. This matter is my own. Sir, I remind, the major may not depart his command... without first informing his adjutant of his whereabouts! Now, that, sir, is in the manual. My whereabouts, Captain.

Yeah? Are you all right? Oh, yeah. Father, will they be sending out someone? No, Son. Why? I told them not to. Why? Well, the-- that wagon train has to be escorted to Fort Stanton. That'll take half the men. The rest have to stay to protect the fort. But what about them? Well, if they get impatient and try to make a fight of it, we got a chance. Suppose they don't? They can't get up-- we can't get down. [ Gunshots Continue ]Oh. - Father, I'm-- - So am I, Peter. What? No one's free from fear. A soldier knows he-- he can't make it go away. All he can do is not let it win. Well, they say about the Kiowas-- I've read books about the Kiowas, what they do. I never thought anyone would come. Peter, you're my son.

[ Gunshot In Distance ] Hey! That's a .50-70! [ Gunshots ] Son, let's build 'em a fire. Okay. [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots Continue ] What you got? I got a damn Henry that shoots low. He's on that-- on that spire there to your left. Can you see him? No! Stay down, Son. [ Gunshot ] Ben.Yeah. Captain. Yes, sir. I gave you an order. You disobeyed it. To the contrary, Major. This is a standard five-man patrol for hostiles in the area. Seeing as I was awake, sir, I saw no reason not to lead it. All right, Captain. Yes, sir. Prepare to mount. You all right, Peter?Yeah. All right, Ben, move it out.[ Nickers ] By twos! Twos forward. Ho! [ Horse Blusters ] Peter, you go with Captain MacDowell. Sergeant-Major.Yes, sir. Bacon and molasses for this boy. He'll get tired of beans soon enough. Peter, you go wash. Cigars and a bottle of whiskey? [ Chuckles ] First thing in the morning. Harkness? John Harkness. We'll remember. Where's home for you? Saint Louis.Saint Louis. Back to Saint Louis?Uh-uh. Uh, Bent's Fort for the winter. Then, uh, try again west. Cavalieri.Sir. Take 'em out.Yes, sir. Escort! By twos. Forward! Ho! Get up. Get up! Hah! Get up! Hah! Get up! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Get up! Hah! Get up! Hah! Welcome back. Think Satanta will move on south now. You made him look pretty bad. Take a look. [ Yawns ] [ Lawler ] Buckley. Ben, you need a rest.[ Yawning ] I've been thinking about that. You'll get one right after we get back from Chao Mesa. Well, that's a half-a-day ride. I want to have my own council with those Navajo. [ Detroville ] Mr. Buckley is a fool. But they will. Come spring, the best of 'em will be back.
