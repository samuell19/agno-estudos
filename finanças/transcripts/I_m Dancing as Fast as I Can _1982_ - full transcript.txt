( classical music plays ) SAM: Nice. That's nice. Barbara: No. You really don't like that music? No. Let's look at the Mexican footage. All right. ( barbara on tape ): Abandoned, stripped. The ocean is not far and comes occasionally into view. To venture there, all you need is the necessary desperation and the necessary money. It might be said that Tijuana is the cash-and-carry Lourdes of North America. ( sighs ) Ah, they got great burritos down there. ( barbara on tape ): Jean Scott Martin, college professor, teacher of medieval literature, and poet herself, with 2 published books. She and her husband have mortgaged their home in new jersey to pay for Jean's treatment in this Tijuana laetrile clinic. That's a great shot. SAM:: Yeah, I love it. ( sighs ) That's powerful. That's really powerful. SAM: That is not a healthy-looking person. Listen. I want to end with the scene at the beach. I mean, that's the point. She's--she's sick, but she just... you know, she gets excited. That's the point, her spirit. Realistically, realistically, you've got to go back to the hospital. ( chuckling ): Why don't you go back to the hospital? It's my goddamn movie, so we'll end it at the beach. I mean, I see it that way. It's about hope. There's hope at the beach. Jean has cancer of the pancreas. She's feeling better. But there's no remission with cancer of the pancreas. It's terminal. Have another cigarette, Fran. SAM: I don't have to tell you, of all people, this, Barbara. But I think our job here is to face the situation at least as well as Jean is. Don't tell me about Jean. I have an instinct about Jean. And I want her to see herself looking beautiful. It's gonna help her recover. You wanna give her an incentive to live? Well, I didn't know that. I thought we were making a movie here about what happened. But it's a cure movie. She happens to be a great person. So was Shakespeare and my Aunt Sally, but they didn't make it. So we end her at the beach. She gets to live forever in freeze-frame at the beach. Thank you. Let's take a break. Yeah, I need some lunch. Want some lunch? Nope. I ordered out. I'll be in the office. ALAN: Barbara. Barbara. Barbara, where are you? BARBARA: I'm in here. Barbara, hi. Oh, thank god, thank god, a valium is just what I need. You're a lifesaver. What are you doing here, Alan? Why aren't you in some fancy restaurant having nouvelle cuisine? Don't make fun of me, Barbara. I just went to the wall for you. I just took a stand for you. I fought for you tooth and nail. Barbara, I just put it all on the line for you, my--my--my job, my reputation, everything. Everything? Goddamn right, everything. My career, everything. Did you win? That's right. I won. If that woman dies before the show goes on the air, they'll kill the commercials. ( phone ringing ) I'd better get that. Might be the hospital. I'm supposed to shoot there this afternoon. By the way, uh, how's she doing? She's getting better. She's getting better? Shit. CREW MEMBER: Rolling. BARBARA: Speed. Shh. Shh. You know, I feel almost fortunate to have the opportunity like this to... of knowing what's happening and living with it. I think of the people who are just taken out, with no warning. Forget it. It's not working. She looks like she's arriving on a spaceship. ( chuckling ) So what do you want to do? BARBARA: Well, let's try moving to the other side of the building. WOMAN: It's gonna be glum over there. BARBARA: Then it'll be glum. You're looking good, Jean. You really are. I was thinking of jumping off the building, of getting out right now. You weren't. Were you? Really? You said I looked good. ( chuckling ) Derek called. He said he'd be waiting for you at Anton's from 7:30 until you got there. JEAN: You wanna hear my favorite story? Well, there was this, uh, man and woman at a singles' resort on a Saturday night, and they were dancing at this dance. And he said, "I'm only here for the weekend." and she said, "Well, I'm dancing as fast as I can." ( both chuckling ) Oh. Me, too. I can tell you. JEAN: ...and sometimes I feel that I'm in this system, in this process, this vast, immense process, the universe still is extraordinarily mysterious, and all our explanations about it are just a bunch of children talking to themselves about the dark. Those are amazing feelings. Well, sometimes we say there are demons, and sometimes we say there's god, and sometimes we say there's no god, as though we had a choice. Well, sometimes I'm just... ( sighing ) well, I get cranky. I get very cranky and, you know, just get pissed. BEN: You've been very pissed. BARBARA: Yes, I... Oh, she said "pissed." CREW MEMBER: Yeah, they both said "pissed." Oh. You can't say "pissed" on T.V. What? You can't. CREW MEMBER: We'll have to dub it. Oh, but I just said it. What are we gonna dub for "pissed"? I don't know. I can't believe this. Well, then what do we do? All right. Miffed. I get hissed. Hissed. I get... I get depressed. I am-- I am depressed. I'm depressed. I get pissed. I'm depressed. I get pissed. I'm depressed. I get pissed. I'm depressed. I get pissed. I get pissed. I'm depressed. ( people chattering ) Hi, Derek. I'm sorry. DEREK: Hello, sweetheart. A spritzer for the lady, please, and I'll have another. Did you read The Voice? No. I was shooting this stuff with Jean all afternoon. Listen. "2-time Emmy winner Barbara Gordon "has produced a searing documentary "on Manhattan's ghetto landlords. "Barbara Gordon will not back down. She is a beacon of light in the darkness." ( sighing ) wow. That's pretty good. ( glass clinking ) how about that? Oh, Jesus! Damn it. How did that happen? I think you must've hit it with your elbow. It's all over my pants. Oh. Who moved my drink? It wasn't where I put it. You know, I put it here and it wasn't there. It was here. And I reached out for something and I hit it. No problem. Look, he was kissing my hand. No, I wasn't. I think that other bartender moved my drink when he took the other order. Why did you deny that you were kissing my hand? Eh? Oh, come on, sweetheart. You know. No, I don't. Only the biggest klutz in the world would spill his drink while trying to kiss a girl's hand, right? You shouldn't worry about it. I don't, but waiters do. That's all they worry about, that's all they have to worry about, that kind of thing. Who said what, who spilled what, and then they talk about it. And don't tell me they don't. I don't want to have a fight with you. Then don't. Okay, I won't. ( sighs ) You know, this stuff of Jean, I'm with it all day. This--this goddamn obscenity. And I'm trying to see something in it, and it's her. She's the beautiful thing in it. And Sam. I don't know what's wrong with him. He's fighting me every single turn. ( sighs ) I just wanna have some fun with you, honey. WAITER: Your table is ready. Excuse me. Well, how can he help but be jealous of you, sweetheart? You think Sam is jealous of me? Well, he wants to make his own films, doesn't he? We keep arguing about the ending. Yeah, and he wants the exact opposite from you. Exactly. How did you get so smart? ( exclaims ) ( sighing ) I would have just blamed good old you-know-who. Now, Barbara. Salud. Cheers. I wanna get married. It'd be so great. I'm just frightened it'll ruin everything. Of course, it's scary. But your entire day you're surrounded by men, and you're the center of their attention and energy. And I would just feel a lot better about it all if we were married. You're a terrific-looking woman. What do you think they're all thinkin' about, kid? What'd you do today? Oh, nothing. Lost the appeal. On a technicality. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. What happened? A goddamn technicality. If I had a highly paid research staff, I could find all the loopholes but when you're defending the poor, no way, Jose. I'm so sorry. So what are you going to do? Can you appeal? Appeal, yeah. Tell me about justice. What a gloomy day. Jesus, what a gloomy day. BARBARA: Tell me about it. You're incredible. It's the Emmy award for best of everything, and you don't even have a dress. What if you win? You know, you're getting weird, too, Barbara. Don't start trashing Derek. Being foreign does not make a person weird. Nor does it make him charming. Hey, Karen, you going to class? Oh, I'll see you later, hon. Where's Michael? You had a crush on Michael. That's what's going on there. True, but even Sam agreed that Michael was a lot more fun. And the one before Michael, what's his name? Tom. Tom. Tom was a lot more fun. Not for me. That's obvious. You like weird Derek. Who could trust your opinion? ( chuckles ) Look, there's Bendel's. I was in there yesterday. They're having a terrific sale. Why don't you go over there and get a great thing? Get something pretty. BARBARA: I really want Jean to see the film, Ben. It's important. I'll bring it to the hospital and show it to her there. It'll be good for her to see herself looking so good. BEN: Jean doesn't really want you to go to any bother. No, no, I--I made the film for her, really. Well, she's getting a little wild. BARBARA: Wild? I-I'll just come see her as a friend. What do you mean, wild? I'll talk to her. ( electric razor humming ) ( music playing ) MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please. ALAN: Barbara. BARBARA: This is Derek Bauer. Alan Newman. Oh, hi. DEREK: Oh, you're the man. Barbara gets up every morning wondering what you think, and then comes home telling me what you've said. Really? That's odd. Never seems to care what I think when she's at the office. So, uh, you're a public defender, Barbara tells me. Well, no, I'm not really a public defender. I just defend people who are too poor to secure legal aid. Oh, that sounds fascinating. Uh, what firm are you with? No, I'm by myself. I don't like big firms. I like independence. KAREN: Hi. I'm so excited. Should I get drunk now or later? KAREN: Your dress looks terrific. ( male announcer chattering ) Are you okay, honey? Fine. KAREN: How's Jean doin'? She's better. I don't know how you make a film when you don't know the ending. I know the ending. ( chuckling ) You want a valium? WOMAN ON T.V.: And the winner for outstanding documentary is Who Controls Your Mind? Barbara Gordon. ( people cheering ) ( woman whooping ) ( audience applauding ) Thank you. Thank you. ( sighs ) Um, we spent a--a year with the former mental patients of Long Beach. It was, um, it was a very difficult time, and I wish I could come here and tell you that they had been re-instituted into the society of Long Beach but un-unfortunately... I--I deeply appreciate this award. And I'm very proud, and I'm--I'm very proud of--of the way I make my living. Thank you. Thank you very much. ( all applauding ) WOMAN: Our next award is for daytime children's... Oh, this is mine. No, this is only a prop, ma'am. We'll send you the real one when we have it engraved. Oh. That's embarrassing. I forgot. BARBARA: I love this city. ( coughing ) Half the time, I'm afraid to walk the streets by myself. You're not alone there. That's not what I mean, and you know it. Do I? If I was afraid of being mugged, I wouldn't worry about it. I'm supposed to be afraid of being mugged. You don't go to a psychiatrist for that. Why do you go? What are you thinking of now, right now? That I've been wasting my time coming here for 10 years. That's what I'm afraid of. Anything else? Isn't that enough? You seem angry. ( sighs ) I finished the film, and Jean hasn't seen it. Something--something strange is going on. I'm worried about her. Yes, well, you do seem more anxious. How much valium are you taking? I'm taking it because I'm afraid I'm gonna have an attack from not taking it. And uh, I'm--I'm--I'm afraid I'm taking too much. So I get so nervous I take some more. Um, 60 milligrams most days. That's a lot. Yesterday, I took, I don't know, 80, 90. Uh, the awards. I don't feel good, you know? I'm scared. That's not a drug to be afraid of, Barbara. There's a relative lack of side effects. And your symptoms have been alleviated. Very good drug, but-- Isn't that too much? Yes, well, it definitely is a lot. ( snickers ) More than you should be taking. I think we might discuss the possibility of your switching to another drug. Uh, perhaps elavil or daridol, or-- I don't wanna take more drugs. We need some kind of drug to control your symptoms, Barbara. Your anxieties are disabling. You're telling me. If you're dissatisfied, Barbara, your duty is to yourself. It's a joke. No. I'll stick with what I have. BARBARA: Well, there you have it. ALAN: Well, um... it's very nice, Barbara. Congratulations, everybody. Thanks. Very touching. I'm so glad. Good work, good work, everybody. It's, uh, it's very sad. Yeah. I want it to be hopeful. It's very touching. So what are you gonna do next? Oh-- She is going to take a vacation. Oh, well, we'll see about that. I have a new project. Adoption agency rip-off. I'll get the bastards. We'll start tomorrow. I mean, you're all wrapped up here, right? ( humming ) Why don't you take a few days off first, huh? What would I do? You'd go shopping. ( sighs ) Oh, um, Ben called. They want to see the movie. She wants to see it? Jean wants to see it? Yeah. When did they call? Yesterday. Yesterday? And you didn't tell me? When yesterday? Oh, god, what is the matter with you sometimes? Come on, let's go, chop-chop. Call and see if you can get the monitor over to the hospital. I wanna get going. JEAN: "Sweet spicy Ann so quietly at home "on a kitchen table. "And the names of presidents, "their dates and states we pressed into a puzzle, "blue with principle products - cotton "corn and cattle. "He would trace the route "of the Illinois Central, "and there would be his father, "conducting the train "on its impeccable course by lifting "a silver watch from his vest "and finding that it read "St. Louis. "And now I clear away the rubble of another meal miles from..." Hi, hon. How are you? Shh. "independence "and Tubby and Horse "ascend in serene nobility to the block." NURSE: Is that you there? JEAN: "Still," What show is this? Shh. "leads them past" It's time for her shot. ( whispering ): Not now. JEAN: It's all right. JEAN: "...cups of cold, murky coffee miracles of surface" What kind of show is this? BEN: Documentary. "...across the golden" NURSE: You on every week? Well, I wanna watch it if you're on every week. "...was history" NURSE: You gonna watch it if she's on every week? Please! That's you, Ben. Well, see you tomorrow. What gall. What monumental gall. I know. I know. Unbelievable. I couldn't believe how rude she was. Honestly, you should report her. Not her. She was a breath of fresh air. Then who? JEAN: Who? You. You with your--your piece-of-shit movie. What the hell is this crap that you're trying to put over on me? You think I'm an imbecile? What is this crap about me on the ocean and I'm hugging my husband? I mean, we look like a goddamn deodorant commercial. Ah. I want to tell you something. Last night, in the middle of the night, something happened here. I don't know what it was, but I was incandescent. I was a goddamn flame here last night. And I know that if anybody had been here, they would have seen that I died. And then, I came back. But I was gone for a little while. It happened to me, and nobody was here. So, I can't expect to be believed. But I was. I was fucking radioactive here last night. And you come in here and show me this--this sanitized horseshit. And you expect me to feel represented? But I don't. I feel demeaned. I feel insulted. No. What I want is your--your criticism, too. Burn it. Burn it? I can't do that. Do you want to know the end of your movie? Barbara, you'd better go. I told you-- I-I'm talking now. You want to know the end? You can't find me anywhere on this entire motherfucking earth. You could take your goddamn camera and your crew up the Amazon, but you won't find me there. Go look in the Bronx, and go to Harlem. You c-- you could try the Orient. Get a guide, go to the ends of the earth, climb mountains, and you can go under the water. But I will not be there. And that is the goddamn end of your movie. You can't find me. I'll work on the ending, Jean, but I can't do all that. Oh, that's right. Take a pill. Goddamn dilettante. Take a valium. That's perfect. That's what you did. You made a valium movie. You look at it, you turn into a zombie. You look at it, you stop feeling or seeing anything real. Just get out. ( jean sighs ) Jean. I'll just change the end of the whole movie. I--I will. You see, you made a movie about death without any death in it. That's a brilliant accomplishment. That's just brilliant. BEN: You better get out. Take your pabulum with you. Take your monument to the power of sanitized horseshit. I'll come-- I'll come back tomorrow. ( clears throat ) and--and then maybe we could talk about it more calmly. Better go. I have work to do. ( frenzied music plays ) ( soft music plays in background ) ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Hi. Oh, I'm sorry, babe. Fran called me. I got here just as fast as I could. Sounds crazy. She went off the deep end is what happened. I told her I'd change it all. Oh, god. She just screamed at me. She hated me. I mean, fuck her. What does she know? Hey. Come on. Aw, she's not so great. Hey... ( music continues playing ) ( music turns up louder ) Here you go. Careful, it's hot. Listen, I got to run, babe, okay? ( phone ringing ) I'll get it. Don't forget tonight. Hello? FRAN: Some people here screened the movie. They really loved it. You let people see it? Damn it, Fran! BARBARA: I told you nobody was to see it. But they really loved it. I'm really mad at you, Fran. They loved it. KALMAN: Hello? Dr. Kalman, it's Barbara Gordon. I'm not coming in today. KALMAN: Oh, yes, Barbara. Anything else? I'm quitting valium. Well, then you'd better come in and talk it over. I don't want any more of that stuff. Barbara, you can't just abruptly-- 10 years of you. I'm worse than when I started. Have you been drinking? No. Are you sure you haven't been? ( sighs ) You know what else, Dr. Kalman? I'm done with you, too. Barbara, what you're intending is-- You're fired. ( kettle whistling ) ( blowing ) ( opera music playing ) DEREK: Anybody home? Hello? Derek. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Am I lucky. Hi. Hi. You know what I did today? What? I stopped valium. You stopped valium? Yep. I can't have anything to drink. Fantastic. When? Last night. Yeah, how long has it been? Uh, last night, in the middle of the night, and I quit Dr. Kalman, too. Now, don't tease me, Barbara. No. I did. I mean, you've always said he wasn't helping me. You said that. Oh, I sure did, I sure did. Absolutely. Oh, baby! ( chuckling ) I'm so revved up! ( music continues ) ( humming ) What are we gonna do to celebrate? ( phone ringing ) Hello? Karen. Hi, I'm great. I'm thrilled. Oh, my god, dinner. I forgot. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you tonight. You know, what--what was good at first, and then it just... it took more and more to do the same thing for me. ( grunting ) It's a great thing she's doing, Sam. She's gonna be so much better off. Oh, I forgot. You know, Fran called the hospital this morning and Jean has checked out. She checked out? That's what Fran said, checked out. Excuse me. I'm gonna call Ben. ( people chattering ) You know, Derek, you know, she should go see a doctor, have a complete checkup. You know, Karen, that's not very bright. Barbara's whole trouble is the fact that she's been listening to doctors. ( man laughing ) Ben, is she better? It's Barbara Gordon. I heard she was out of the hospital and I felt so excited. Oh, no, I didn't realize what time it was. I'm sorry it's so late. No. Will you at least tell me how she is? Ben. ( music playing ) Barbara, I can't sleep. Me, neither. I mean, because of all your rolling around. Will you help me? Help you what? Just no matter what, no matter what, promise me you won't leave me. Of course not, sweetheart. Anything? Anything? Of course. Just go to sleep. Okay. ( sighing ) I don't know if I should go in today or not. Fran called. Listen, baby yourself and take it easy. You deserve it. I gotta go. See you later. Have fun. DEREK: Okay, I'll try. Bye. ( door closing ) ( cup clinking ) ( panting ) ( groaning ) Hey, babe! Oh. BARBARA: You scared me. I'm sorry. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot my briefcase. Oh. Ah, here it is. Listen, I've been thinkin'. I could take Friday off and we could go to the beach and beat the weekend crowd. What do you say? Oh, that would be great. Okay. Listen, I gotta go, gotta go. I'm late. ( sighs ) ( seagulls cawing ) DEREK: You okay, honey? BARBARA: No. My head. ( sighing ) Ah. Beautiful. Yeah. You okay? Yeah. I just feel weak. Oh, smell that ocean. Dizzy. ( sighs ) Okay? Yeah. Wait. ( panting ) Oh, damn. I left the tape recorder on the porch. I'll have to go back and get it. Can you hold these just for a second? Oh. Oh. Oh, I broke them. It's all right. It doesn't matter. Oh, god. My head is on fire. What, y-y-you mean it's very itchy? No. It's like... it's fire. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, god. Come on, listen, now don't worry about the wine. I'll just drive up to the little shop and get some more, okay? It won't take me 2 minutes. Here, wait there. ( seagulls cawing ) Aspirin. Some aspirin. Yeah. Look, just spread out the blanket and take a little rest. ( sighing ) ( groaning ) ( grunting ) You don't think I need Dr. Kalman? You don't think my father had anything to do with it? I mean, the pills. The way he treated me, the way I let Dr. Kalman treat me. Ow! Goddamn it! Do you still feel he doesn't love you anymore? Who? I mean, your father, that he doesn't love you anymore. Of course he does. Are you trying to hurt my feelings? I'm not. I thought that's what you said. He got mad at me, but I think he loved me under it all. At least, I think he did. I don't want to discuss it. You can't just bring something up like that, and then say you don't want to discuss it! I didn't mean to bring it up. I thought you did. And I don't want to discuss it. How come you think my father doesn't love me? Because you're a brat. Sometimes, you're a goddamn selfish brat. You mean, to you. I mean, to your father. You don't know anything about my father. Here. Have a drink. I'm trying to quit valium. Well, it doesn't mean you can't have some vodka, does it? Well, Dr. Kalman said so. He--he said he hoped I wasn't drinking. Yeah. He's also the one who told you to take valium, isn't he? So have a drink. Fuck you. Fuck you. ( groaning ) ( groaning ) ( groaning ) ( whispering ): Derek, Derek, listen, I have to show you something. Huh? I waited as long as I could. Huh? Come on, it's important. ( sighs ) See, I was up all night, reading. ( grunts ) And I couldn't figure it out. And then I figured it all out. Figured it all out. Come on, I'll get you some coffee. Look at it. I mean, I was up all night, reading. And I started with psych books and Jean's poetry. I didn't get anywhere. Suddenly I realized, it was like out of the blue, I realized that the missing ingredient was mathematics, or more correctly geometry which is the main factor of all modern scientific exploration. So I started making these triangles. I realized it was like the key to figuring out all human relationships. Do you see the sequence here? Here's mine. Here's Jean's. Here's gramps'. Yeah. You've been doin' this all night? Yeah. It took me half the night to think of it. Oh, god! The coffee. And, uh, this one below yours, is that mine? It could be. Now wait a minute. Is it or isn't it? I'm just trying to follow this. Don't get ahead of me. Well, I don't want to. I'm just trying to find out if it's my triangle. And I--I mean, is it or isn't it? Your triangle isn't the point. Fuck you. You drag me out of bed to tell me that. It could be the point later. It's very big later. But, you see, I'm wondering if Jean knew I killed my grandfather. I mean, I killed him accidentally because I wouldn't baby-sit my little brother. And so my folks called gramps, that he had to come over and do it. So he was hurrying over because they were late on their way to a party at the Bumhovers', and he had a heart attack, and he died. And if she knew about it, I mean, Jean, that is, you see, that would explain why she treated me that way, why she hated my film, everything. Her triangle and mine intersect here in what is either an unknown apex or a work apex. And here's gramps' triangle, and he has no intersection except with mine. And everybody has a ghost triangle. And that's what all these are? Right. Ghost triangles. ( sighs ) I think I'm going crazy. I think I better call Dr. Kalman. DEREK: No. No. Why? What, because of this triangle thing? No, no, no, no, no. Look, I think this triangle thing is interesting. Just so long as you don't mean it completely and literally, or... Oh, no, no. No. No. No. How do you mean it? Well, just--just-- just--just... ( chuckling ) it's... It's an explanation aid. Listen. If you can say you think you might be crazy, then you're not. I know you're not. I'm gonna stay home today, though. You're scared about this, aren't you? No. It's fascinating, and I think it's really, really interesting. Oh. Oh, I feel like getting drunk, actually. Why? ( chuckling ): I don't know why. I just feel, I just do, I just feel like getting drunk. Well, it's not the first time I've ever been depressed, so I'll work it out. Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to the store. I'm gonna get some booze. ( door closing ) See you in a while. ( door banging ) BARBARA: Have you seen my... my, my, you know, my-- my what-you-ma-call-it? No. ( sighing ) How's your scalp? Itchy. That's good. No fire. And the crawling things on your arms? You know, my father, the day my brother was born, he just... he kept yelling: "Thank god it's a boy!" ( crying ) ( shouting ): I want some valium, Derek! How's that supposed to make a person feel? ( moaning ) I don't want to be with feelings like that. Me, neither! Who cares? Who cares? ( sobbing ) But you can't just sit there, rocking back and forth and feeling fuckin' sorry for yourself. ( continues crying ) You expect me to handle everything. It's very complicated. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've put some of my best energy into trying to help you, to work these things out, so that you can face the fact that you appear to be more successful than the man in your life. And that's not the way you were raised. ( sobbing ) So that's where the pills came in. You know, why shouldn't she be as famous and successful as she can be? You know, I would say to myself, you know, to help you, what it takes to help you. I'm--I'm sorry--sorry. I'm sorry. I'm-- oh, god... You know, I haven't had a case in weeks. You know, I don't have an office anymore. You know what I do? I go to the fucking movies. But I didn't tell you, Oh, god. ...'cause I knew it would drive you crazy and you couldn't stand to face how fucked up everything is! Oh, god. ( crying ) But I've got my limits, too! You know? I've ruined everything. Oh--oh, god! I shouldn't have quit! Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, no. I shouldn't have. Look, would you stop crying, please. Would you stop-- would you stop. Come on, stop-- ( phone ringing ) Come on, now. Come on, use a pillow or something. Look, I don't want whoever it is to hear you crying now. Oh, good. Hello. Hello. Oh, Karen. Hi. Uh, no, she's sound asleep. Oh, yeah, she's much better. Okay, yeah. Listen, can I have her call you back? Okay. All right. Bye. ( Barbara sobbing ) ( panting ) Oh, thank you. Thank you. Let's do something. Let's go to the movies. ( crying ): Oh, no! Oh, god! I don't want to go outside! No. Please. Please? Please promise me you'll stay here. Just you and me forever. Promise me? Please? Please! Please! I won't go, and you can't make me! ( screaming ): You can't make me! Did you see what I just did? Did you see me? Did you see me stomp my foot and act like a baby? I've got to go to a doctor. I've gotta go. You've got to take me to a doctor. Where are my keys and stuff? Okay, I've got my keys, I've got my glasses, I've got my identification things. Barbara! Stop now! I'm ready! Listen to me. Now, listen. I love you. Now, I love you. But if you saw a doctor now, they would probably lock you up. Is it that bad? Is it that terrible? It'd be hopeless. Hopeless? Hopeless? Oh, no. Oh, god. Oh, no. ( barbara sobbing ) Listen, listen, we'll get you just a little well first and then we'll take you to a doctor. Look, I'm not gonna let it happen. I'm not gonna let you go crazy, sweetie. I feel like a bar of soap. What do you mean? A bar of soap. Don't you know what a bar of soap is? Yes, I know what a bar of soap is. Well, stop screaming at me. But I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Leave me alone! Tell me what you mean by "I'm feeling like a bar of soap." No! Tell me what it means to feel like a bar of soap! No! No! BARBARA: You just tell her, Ben. I feel like everybody's rubbing on me, and... don't interrupt me. ( whispering ): I'm disappearing. You--you just tell her I've reread some of her poems and they're not all so goddamn great, right? You just tell her. That--that's bullshit! That's just bullshit! Yeah. You just tell her. ( sighing ) ( phone thudding ) What are you doing? Get back to bed. I couldn't sleep. Ben must think I'm really stupid. I'm supposed to believe she ran away from the hospital after we had that fight. ( derek sighing ) Oh, god, they want to blame me for everything. MALE NEWSCASTER: ...the 130's due to that construction. Southbound west side highway traffic is also tied up in the 70s with an accident blocking the left lane. At the Lincoln Tunnel, 20-minute backup reported both in and outbound. The Holland is a better bet for you. And that problem in Westchester County, Southbound route 684 remains closed... Barbara. Barbara, where are you? ( doorbell buzzing ) I'll get it. I'll get it. BARBARA: I'll get it. I'll get it. MAN: Delivery from Talbot's pharmacy. ( music playing on radio ) DEREK: Oh. Thank you. Can I have some? I think I need some. Tsk, you dirty little sneak. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I have some? How am I gonna do this if I can't trust you? BARBARA: I think I need some. I thought I could trust you. Can I have some, please? Don't you move. ( door closing ) ( toilet flushing ) ( phone ringing ) Hello? Oh, Dr. Kalman. Uh, no, no, she's sleeping. ( chuckling ): Uh, yeah, well, thank goodness she came to her senses. Yeah. Uh, well, uh, I'm... yeah, well, I'm--I'm sure that she'll be in to see you just as soon as we get back from Europe. Yeah. Okay, I'll tell her. All right, bye. MALE ANNOUNCER #1: From Albany, New York state employees may be asked to shorten their paid workweek to forestall thousands of layoffs. That is one of the... MALE ANNOUNCER #2: Or you can charge your tickets by calling Carnegiecharge this Sunday afternoon at 3:00 at Carnegie Hall. ( channels changing ) MALE ANNOUNCER #3: For only $12.50... ( static ) MALE ANNOUNCER #4: This program will achieve 3 objectives. WOMAN ANNOUNCER: A bystander was killed in what was apparently a gangland attack on 2 men in Brooklyn. ( channel changing ) MALE ANNOUNCER #5: You're listening to FM 105, W.R.F.M., where you heard the... MALE ANNOUNCER #6: It helps you with social and personal decisions. Uh... WOMAN ANNOUNCER #2: So if you're aware of this k-factor, it can help you, uh... ( indistinct chattering on radio ) WOMAN ANNOUNCER #3: You can sign up for the stop smoking program, being sponsored by... ( gasping ) What are you doing? Don't you think I know what you're doing? You'll just go to the first doctor you can find and get more valium. You'll just get hooked again. BARBARA: No. Then we'll have to go through this all over again. Oh, oh, I want some help. I need some help! Derek, we both need some help. Don't you think we need some help? Go back to bed. ( whispering ): Okay. ( barbara crying ) ( derek grunting ) ( gasping ) ( groaning ) ( yelling ) ( screaming ) Don't lock me out of my goddamn anything, anytime, Barbara. Don't hurt me, please. And no more pills! Okay! Okay! Okay? ( screaming ): Okay! No, no, no, no! ( screaming ) Oh, no, no, no, no, please! Damn it, you... ( grunting ) ( screaming ): Don't kill me! Don't kill me! That's it. Act like a baby. Little baby Barbara. On her way to crazy town. With the crazy town men. And the crazy town people. Stop it! ( screaming ) ( grunting ) ( groaning ) Goddamn bitch! No! No! Okay. ( sighing ) Just take this. And have some nice warm soup. Here we go. Derek. Honey, I think I've been selfish here. I mean, me, me, me. I think we both need to go somewhere and both have doctors helping us. Do you want to do that? Nope. Nope. Nope. Now that the situation is stabilized, we can get at what's been going on. Come on. What day is it? Thursday. Thursday? Karen and Sam are coming. You gotta stop them. They're not coming. Yes, they are. Last week, you--you blacked out 'cause you drank so much. I mean, you were-- you were just tired from all the shopping and the cooking. And I thought everything would be okay, and I--I told them to come over. They can't see us like this. Jesus Christ. ( cutlery rattling ) KL5-5321. What'd you say? KL5-5321. 532... Huh, ringing. Karen. Hi, it's Derek. ( screaming ): Help! Help! Help! Karen! Help! No, nothing's wrong. Karen! ( screaming ): Karen! No, she's just doing that primal-scream stuff for a new film. Yeah. Come on, sweetheart. I can't hear Karen. Karen, no! That's not true! Oh, uh, Sam. Sam, no. Sam, don't. No, Sam! ( continues screaming ) You--you tricked me! You crazy bitch! ( shouting ): Now what am I gonna do? ( sobbing ) ( sighing ) ( door clicking ) She's hopelessly insane. ( gasping ): Oh. Who did this? Derek. Would you step up on the scale now, please? Is Derek your husband? No, boyfriend. Any family history of diabetes? No. Heart problems? Barbara, you're depressed. And I'm going to give you something to make you feel better. It's called sinequan. It's an antidepressant. Then can I go home? Don't you think... ( gasping ) Sorry. ( sighing ) Um, I mean, the first order of business ought to be rest and good food. Let us get to know one another. Valium withdrawal is at least as traumatic to go through as opiate withdrawal. I felt good at first. That's often the case. ( knocking on door ) ( sighing ) Oh, thank you. I should have been more careful. Yes, you should have. But the withdrawal is over now. You don't have to worry about valium anymore. I can go home? DOCTOR: Barbara, what's so important? I've got a lot of things to do. But I'm sure it can wait. No, I've gotta take care of it. I need the money. I'm going. ( sighing ) I've got to get out of this country. Maybe Italy. Yeah, I was in Italy once. I loved Italy. I can learn the language. Actually, I speak it fairly well already. ( clicking tongue ) I fagiolini sono freschi e belli oggi. That's not bad. Parli l'italiano molto bene. Si? That's nice. Really. That's really... ( chuckling ): You know... in time, you know, I could speak it even better. If you speak it well enough you could become one of them. And they love everybody. I don't think he'd ever find me there. I mean, Derek. See, I had no idea how much he hated me. He wanted to kill me. I don't think he'd come all the way to Italy to do it. But even if he did, I'd be, uh, a big fat person. And I'd have an Italian name and I'd speak perfect Italian. I'd be like one of their, um, ( clicking tongue ) you know, those monuments. ( sighing ) But my friends are gonna have to watch out for him, boy. If I were you, I wouldn't drink that. See, Derek, well, he probably might have managed to find a way to put poison in it. See, you've been very nice to me. He probably hates you for it. Just don't drink it, okay? Okay. ( whispering ): Okay. DEBBIE: You wanna go right there. I gotta make a phone call. No, I gotta, uh... ( people chattering ) It's okay. That's my purse. I'll just take it from you, okay, Barbara? That's--that's my Bloomingdale's charge card. Uh, it has sharp edges. ( keys rattling ) ( people chattering ) ( clearing throat ) I've been waiting for this chance to talk to you. Would you like to come with me tonight to the planet Uranus? It could be arranged. I go there frequently. I don't feel too good. You don't mind? ROGER: You don't have to make up your mind now anyway. I think you should know that they have a very high opinion of you on Uranus. I was informed of this factor just late last night. We don't go in one big jump, you know. We stop off at the moon. We change our modular unit, have a burger. We do it in stages, so that we don't overload any of our systems. You remember, uh, John F. Kennedy? He was a great man, wasn't he? His brother, Bobby. Martin Luther King. It's a shame. I miss all those fucking guys. Poor bastard. He's got the swamp lady. She's a terrible person-doctor. That terrible thing used to be my doctor. I tried to kill her every time I went to see her. Then they made me stop. My doctor is Dr. Addison. She used to be my doctor, till I didn't need one anymore. She's been to Uranus several times. She likes it. BARBARA: The teacher, she asked me to bow my head in prayer. I was indignant. Do you have a match? I put down "human" for the question what race was I? I don't allow smoking in here. What do you mean? It is my opinion that smoking is just another way-- I smoke cigarettes. I have a habit. Not in here. I didn't come in here to be in goddamn smokenders. If you don't light my cigarette, I'm not saying another word. Well, then I'll see you next session. Or you can just sit here while I do some paperwork. You know, this is preposterous. I want another doctor. I'm your therapist. You won't let me smoke. You took me off sinequan. I'll never get another pill around here. I can fake I'm healthy. I know how to do that. I did it for years. I'll fake it and I'll get out. You won't fool me. Yes, I will! I'm very smart. I'm much smarter than you. I'll get out of here if I have to cut my throat. I-I'm sure you can find a less extreme measure to prove how smart you are. You smug little glamour queen. Don't you know I did everything you're doing? I mean, y-y-you walk around here like you know where you're going. I had nice clothes. I had a bullshit attitude. A big-deal briefcase. No big deal. ( whispering ): Can I hold the cigarette? Do you mind that? Look, Barbara, we have 20 minutes left. Do you want to talk a little bit about, you know, Derek? No. Your home? No, I really don't. I've been in therapy for 10 years. I've talked over everything. ( sighing ) all you people do anyway is--is--is listen to my bullshit and give me a pill. Except me. Right. ( crying ): Except you. Oh, shit. I don't know what I want. ( sniffing ) I really don't know what I want. Yes, you do. No, I don't. Yes, you do, Barbara. No, I don't. Yes, you want help. No! That's what you want. No, no. I don't. Listen to me. When you told Dr. Roberts about the water, the poison in the water, you actually believed it was there. Yes, I did. You thought Derek brought it, that he probably carried it with him everywhere. Yes? Yes. Yes. He probably carried it with him just in case you made a friend. Right. Yes. He probably snuck into the office when no one was there and put poison in all the water. That's what I thought. Yes. Well, I think something good in you, something healthy in you, knew that you needed help. And it made sure you got it. You knew that Dr. Roberts would send you here. No. ( patient yelling ) PATIENT: Spell me once, just once. MALE ORDERLY: Roger! Roger, let go. ROGER: I didn't kill anybody. All I asked you to do was spell me. Look, I just asked him to spell me once. ROGER: I didn't kill anybody! He's a sore loser. I know. Roger. Roger. Come on, go to your room. You're 5 minutes late for our session. Roger's gonna hurt somebody one of these days. I took the liberty of picking up your mail and phone messages, some of which are over a week old. Tsk, you ought to put Roger on medication. He is on medication. Nothing I say or do pleases you. I'm really sick of it. You're spending too much time in your room, Barbara. They've put a new level of difficulty into crossword puzzles. It takes all my concentration. You're allowed to go outside. There's volleyball, or tennis. Or, in the occupational-therapy room, they have painting. I bet you have a wonderful visual sense. You're all such a bunch of bastards. First you mess me up. Then you make me feel like trash about how messed up I am. All us? Doctors. Shit for brains. First you make me take valium, then you make me give it up. ( sighing ) Who made you take it? Don't be a smart-ass. Dr. Kalman made me take it. How did he force you? He made me take it. We're not dealing with valium anymore, Barbara. Now we're dealing with the feelings it helped to suppress. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for valium. I think you would have been here a lot sooner. Who's Karen and Sam Mulligan? Fuck you! "Who's Karen and Sam Mulligan?" Isn't the patient supposed to do what their doctor tells them? Go to the occupational-therapy room as soon as we're finished and paint a picture. Oh, I hate you. I hate you! I really hate you. We should open a window. There's no air-- No! It's my window and I want it closed. It's my room. God! You know, you're a regular genius. You prescribe finger paints and open windows. Have you ever thought that you might be the worst doctor ever born? Who's Roger's doctor? If Roger is getting medication, I want Roger's doctor. I just need the right medication to help me live. And you don't even help me try to find it. Now would you just tell me, who is Roger's doctor? I am. ( sighing ) No wonder he's so goddamn crazy! We're gonna get you to look at yourself without pills. That's what we're going to accomplish here. Oh, god! What an arrogant pig you are! You're disgusting! You're revolting! You're stupid! What else? You're inept! ( screaming ): You're rotten! You're shitty! You know, it's not really me you're angry at. It's what I represent-- No! It's you! It's little Julie, good girl, help everybody, no pills Addison, who I hate! With her little black hair and her little--little--little prom-queen point of view. You're sophomoric! Do you know that? You're sophomoric! In what way? Shut up. Shut up. Just listen to me. God damn it! Get out! It's my room! And I wanna be alone in it! ( birds chirping ) Dr. Addison. Dr. Addison. I don't want these. Then throw them away. Okay. What's going on? Something's different. I feel funny. You're outside. Oh. Yeah. Lots of work for people to write these, put stamps on them. Going home now? Barbara, if you didn't attack me, I wouldn't be doing my job. Some job. That's the occupational-therapy room, right around the corner there. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. ( car door closing ) ( car starting ) I picked up my knife and fork in the cafeteria yesterday and there was food all over my fork. It was disgusting. I'm gonna relay your feelings about that to the kitchen. And let's hope it doesn't happen again, Lara. Anyone else? I hated my food yesterday. KLEIN: Okay, Joe. The record player is on all the time, or the TV. I need an hour of quiet each day. KLEIN: That's an interesting idea, Barbara. I want to know why I haven't gotten my weekend pass yet. Because you're a fucking nutcase. RAWLINGS: Jimmy. JIMMY: Yes? Behave yourself now. Okay. Dr. Klein, can I break Jim's head open? That's not allowed, Iris. Well, uh, it's a hot day today, so let's just have a short meeting. Have a wonderful weekend. And those of you on weekend passes, take very good care of yourself. And I'll see you on Monday. IRIS: Thank you, Dr. Klein. You're welcome, Iris. Barb. You have a visitor. Yeah. Really? Mmm. Is it a man? No, no, it's a woman. Karen. Karen. ( door closing ) I've decided to write a poem about mental institutions and I heard you were in one. So I thought I'd come by and ask if I could write it about you. Sure. What do you do all day? Sip melancholy tea and read Keats and Shelley? Bugs Bunny. What about it? We watch cartoons. Ah. Well, Ben said you called him in the middle of the night to say you hated one of my poems. That isn't true. Well, Ben never lies. No. Well, which one was it? How have you been? Oh, no, I want to know which poem you hated. I wanted to hurt your feelings. He said you weren't there. I went on a trip. How long have you been here? What day is it? July 18. A couple of months. I really want to apologize for the way I behaved about the movie, because some of it was really good. I--I did sincerely hate the end, but that's not the point. I counted on it for something. You know, a--a writer like me... I publish a couple of books of poetry and the audience is cunning but miniscule. I--I let... my fancy was overtaken by the idea of an audience of millions. Television. You can understand that. A chance for my work to be seen. The big time, you know. Well, it has nothing to do with you. You were right, though. Oh, well, in the matter of my objection, not in the manner. What happened to it? It hasn't been on, has it? No, it's not finished. It's a work in progress. Well, at least you will be able to find out who you are when all the bullshit's over. It just shouldn't hurt this much. Well, why not? I'm being eaten alive by myself. I don't particularly care for the environment here. I don't think I'll come back. But I'm rooting for you, though. Hope I see you again. And if you want to see me, well, you come find me. I'll be in a park someplace, taking notes. See, like that. I'd better make a note about that guy. He's a great guy, full of secrets. You're in a very interesting place. Jean, if I get out of here, will you work on the film with me? Make an ending. I'll think about it. No, I will. I'll do it. You will? Yeah. Why not? Thought I was escaping by going out of town. Well, I'm back now. ( inaudible ) ( inaudible ) "Wait," I told her, "wait, it's got a great happy ending." * suddenly I saw you there Foggy London town * * the sun was shining Everywhere * "Uh," she says, "thank god. At last some happiness." ( chuckling ) So, now, what do we have here? Hmm? We have a big New York TV executive, who's pretending for her mother that she can't arrange her personal life at all. And then came Derek. And, uh, your career is still a success, but, uh, you're a pill-popping dingbat at home. That's mean. What I'm saying is, if you have to cripple yourself to get love, then it's not love that you're getting. You know what? Yeah, you're gonna lock me up forever. No. I think you're ready to get out of here, Barb. ( sighing ) ( door lock clicking ) ( keys rattling ) JEAN: ...and sometimes I feel that I'm in this system, in this process... LARSEN: I had this vast experience but I just don't understand what it means. ( knocking on door ) Excuse me. JEAN: ...no god, as though we had a choice. Mr. Brunner said I could use this room to fix this turkey up. ...mysterious, and all our explanations about it are just a bunch of children talking to themselves about the dark. Who are you? ALAN: Barbara, what can I do? He's my new boss. You don't know this guy. He's murder. Just tell him he can't pull me off it and bring in some 3rd-rate editor who's never done anything but sitcoms. Did anybody knock? Is my secretary dead? Barbara, Mr. Brunner's busy. You can't just barge-- I'm busy too, Walter. I'm very busy. BRUNNER: Miss Gordon, by the look of things, maybe you left your institution a little early. ( brunner chuckling ) ( sighing ) Sit down. Just kidding. This is a bluff and you know it. Because, contractually, I have the right to finish my film. And nobody can touch it, unless I don't finish it in the next 62 days. So just get that guy out of my editing room. That's not the point. The point is, I like Larsen. He's going to finish it. I've told him my ideas and he likes my ideas. I'm not interested in your ideas. You are interested in making other programs for us. Barb, what Bob means, at--at least what I think he means is, you've been under incredible pressure and strain. Immeasurable stress. Uh, I mean, uh, I mean, Einstein couldn't, uh, measure the stress you've been under. Give yourself a break, huh? You mean, give you a break. He doesn't need a break! He is fine! So we understand each other? Oh. Ah, you just what I needed in my life. A lot of people feel that way. I'll finish my own film. I'll meet my legal obligations. And you interfere with me, I'll sue you. That might be fun. Miss Gordon. You know, I screened your cut. And, uh, I know all about your Emmys, but forgive me, I didn't see much sign of talent in it. That's exactly why I want to work on it. ( rain pattering ) ( thunder rumbling ) Where were we? ( sighing ) you know, when I was feeling crazy, whatever it was, I did this thing with triangles where everybody had a triangle and a ghost triangle. Everybody. The entire world. That sounds right. It was all interrelated, everything. I really understood it, and now I don't. Mmm, me, neither. Roger would have probably known about it. Oh, this is no fun. ( clicking tongue ) Roger would have known what? Whoever he is. You take anybody's advice. He was, uh, this patient, and he traveled, he said, in outer space to the planets. Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. He kept inviting me to go. Oh, was it nice? ( sighing ) BARBARA: I turned him down. Oh. He had maps. Charts, even. There was an unknown planet, he said, beyond all the known ones, that was god's house. And he was gonna visit. And you turned him down. I was crazy. And he had a map. I could use a map. Yes. He had it all worked out. It wasn't hard, he said. He didn't go in one big jump. He'd stop off at the moon. You'd change your modular unit, have a burger. ( chuckling ) Have a burger on the moon with somebody who knows the way? Well... and then go to see god. I wish I knew if it's time to give in. ( jean sighing ) There must be a time. Sure, you have to put up a good fight, but then you have to give in. And I've put up a good fight, haven't I? ( thunder rumbling ) I don't have an ending, Jean. You have to help me figure it out. Uh, well, let me see. You on the beach. Uh, no. JEAN: End it with you running on the beach, 'cause you'll still be here. See, it won't be bullshit if it's you, because you will still be here. That wouldn't make any sense. Oh, don't let that s-stop you. I do think it's a good idea. You can dance, you can wave at the moon, you can run. You'd be very nice. You do whatever you want to do. Or, you can end it with me coming back. How about I come back from the dead? After all, you did it. BARBARA: I think we need something that's stronger, more powerful. Something double-edged. Find the track where the doctor describes how the disease progresses and run it on the screen. ( buzzer buzzing ) Okay, it's not gonna fit. Of course it will. We've got an air date in a week. Who's that, Fran? Take a message. It's Ben. ( beeping ) MAN #1: Stand by on V.T.R. 2. MAN #2: 60 seconds to commercial. V.T.R. 2, ready. BARBARA: Jean Scott Martin died on August 12, 1981. This documentary on the last year of her life is dedicated to her memory. And it is ending as she asked me to end it.
