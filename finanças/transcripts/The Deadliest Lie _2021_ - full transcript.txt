Come on, Miles, answer. Miles? Miles? Kiki, you are a lifesaver. I know. But thanks for saying so, Sam. So, why the early call-in? Oh, we'll soon find out, but the Turk case is my guess. Hopefully, Monty will wanna build a strategy before the weekend. Girl, I cannot wait to see the look on their faces when we drop this T. - Uh-huh. - Thank you, truthsayers. I have a really good feeling about this one. I think Monty might let me lead the charge for once. Ooh, girl, it's about time. Forging my path to partner. You got everything loaded on to the tablet? Um, multiple photos, the articles? - Mm-hmm, got it all. - Thank you, Kiki. I don't know what I would do without you. How many minutes do I have left? - Exactly three. - How do I look? - Ooh, like a future partner. - Mm-hmm. Let's get right to it. As you know, uh, this is a very high profile case for us. So I need you to bring your A-game. Taz, my man. - Let's do the walk-through. - My pleasure. Our client, the all pro wide-out for this great city... Always comes through for fantasy... Hey, and, and, might I add, just released a new line of tequila that has proceeds going to At-Risk Teens... - Get on with it. - Okay. Our guy, Jaden Turk, meets a young, poor waitress at a well-known, upscale restaurant. Now, not much out of the ordinary, except, he's married at the time. And now his ex-wife wants a substantial amount of alimony for all her pain and suffering. That's where we come in. Our client is only willing to pay the bare minimum. He believes that his ex-wife is an opportunist. A what now? He claims that she agreed to an open marriage, and is using this as a get-rich-quick scheme. Is he willing to negotiate something, anything? Mm, it's gonna be a tough sell. You see, basically, Mr. Turk believes he's the victim in all this. Jim? What about a-a nice hefty upfront settlement for a little smoothing over, and maybe that way the monthly alimony won't have such a sting? Sam, what about you? Thoughts. Well, I say, before we settle on anything, we see exactly what her pain and suffering has looked like. I have a suspicious feeling Mrs. Turk hasn't been curled up in a ball, crying her eyes out at home. - And why's that? - Well... She doesn't look so distraught here. - And this was five days ago. - Hm. I'm not saying I approve of what Jaden Turk did, but come on, you marry a star athlete, you typically know what comes with that. Come on! I mean... E-everybody deals with grief in different ways. Hell, when my wife left me, I was dancing for joy. The judge isn't gonna give that a second thought. Yeah, but it helps tame the dollar signs. Mm, that it does. I like it. Jim, you take lead on this. Take Taz, talk to our client, see what you can find through his financials. The rest of us, time for a weekend strategy session. I know it's short notice, but I wanna go over every possible angle her attorneys might throw at us. The, uh, the partners are vested in this one. Sound good? - It sounds good. - Great. Monty, what the hell? I just offered up a game-changer. - And I'm more than capable... - I know you are, Sam. I just feel that the client would be more comfortable with Jim and Taz at this particular moment. - Because they're men? - No, not at all. It's just a gut feeling. We're a team. Remember, he wins, we all win. Get current, Monty. Women are capable of more than just picking up your dry-cleaning. Bye, Sam. Sammy, what happened in there? What always happens. I gave Monty a solid play and he hands it off to Jim and Taz. Oh, it's a damn boy's club in this office. - That's no secret. - And we're working this weekend. Again! Building the strategy I just gave them. Mm-mm. Wait, what about taking Tony to the lake this weekend? Canceled. I tell you, between my angry teenager and these law jocks every single day... it's easy to lose sight of the purpose. it's like I'm losing myself, you know? I know things have been really hard for you, uh, especially with the divorce. But forget about those guys. Kiki is here, and I think tonight's the best night for a best friend's girls' night! We'll dance at Al, we'll have some drinks... I can't, I need to spend time with Tony, especially if I'm busy all weekend. Besides, I honestly don't know if I remember how to socially interact with people. Can I ask you a question? Do you honestly know whether you remember how to shake, shake, shake that ass, girl? I know you can shake, shake, shake it, girl. Tony? - Tony? - Yeah, mom. - Yeah, what? - Don't "what" me. There's no maid service here. Hey, mom, what time are we leaving for the lake house tomorrow? I invited Rick and Steve. - Is that okay? - No. It's not okay because it was supposed to just be you and me spending time together. But it doesn't matter. I have to work this weekend. Okay, well, can me and the guys still go? I'm gonna be 18 in a few months. It'll be good practice for letting go some. But you're not 18 yet, and I'm still responsible for you. Come on, mom, please. No parties, I promise. Forget it, Tony. The answer is no. What is the point of us having a lake house if we never go? You work all the time. And if I don't work, how do you expect me to pay for your video games, your lacrosse trips? Whatever. I'll just go to dad's for the weekend. Oh, so you wanna go to your dad's on our weekend? At least I have an actual life. Some actual fun. Well, if that's what you wanna do, Tony, fine. I won't stop you. So this is the new swanky bar in town, huh? Girl, it's a little young, isn't it? Just a little eye candy, honey. Oh. Ooh! This will make you feel younger. Cheers. - I'm sorry. - Ooh, he's yummy. - You should dance with him. - What? - He's way too young for me. - Oh, my gosh, who cares? - Hey there. - Hello. - I'm Clay. - Sam. Well, Sam, it took me a minute to build up the courage to ask you to dance, so I hope you don't shoot me down. Ooh. I'm here with my friend. No, she would absolutely love to dance with you, Clay. She'd love to. I know. Shall we? Just relax. Yeah. You wanna get out of here? Maybe grab a drink over at my place? Um, I-I think I... I-I don't, I don't think I can. I gotta find my friend. Looks like I might need that ride after all. One drink. I promise. Oh! Clay... I've had a wonderful night, but I-I think I should just get a car from here. Come on, one drink, then you can Uber from my place. It's just a couple of blocks away. I've had a little too much to drink and... Look, hey, why don't we have dinner next weekend? Hey, Sam, we're both right here, the night is young, it's beautiful, just like you. Yeah, you flatter me Clay, but really, I-I think it's best that I go home. But seriously, I would love to have a dinner next weekend. Come on, one drink. You're hurting my feelings. Excuse me? Hurting your feelings? Well, what about me? What about what I want? Hey, I'm just trying to romance a pretty lady. And I just said I wanna go home. Why can't you get that through your thick skull? - Okay. Just calm down, beauti... - No, you calm down. I'm tired of people not caring about what I want! Yeah? Well, I'm getting tired of this. - What's your damn problem? - Nothing. - I just wanna go home! - Yeah? Well, now I'm getting sick of you, you snobby bitch! No! Wait. Just wait. - I'm done waiting! Just shut up! - Oh! Ah! You son of a bitch! - Hurting my feelings. - What? Excuse me? I'm just trying to romance a pretty lady. And I just said I wanna go home. Why can't you get that through your thick skull? Yeah, well, now I'm getting sick of you, you snobby bitch! No! Wait! - Just calm down, beauti... - No, you calm down! Yeah? Well, I'm getting tired of this. What's your damn problem? Nothing! Wait! I'm done waiting! Just shut up! Hey, girl, hey! Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Sammy. Um, no, no, Kiki. I'm fine. What are you, what are you doing here? It's, it's Saturday. Well, if you're working, I'm working. Plus, I called you last night and you didn't pick up. Everything's fine. I just... - Are you okay, Sam? - Yeah. Why? Well, you have that strategy session with Monty and Jim, I... Damn. I know. I-I-I just don't feel good. It's okay, I-I can sit in and I'll bring you up to speed later, I'll just, I'll tell 'em... - Thank you. - ...you had to rush out. Excuse me? Weren't you at the Hi-Ball last night? Uh, the place on 3rd? I'm sorry, do I know you? The parking lot, way in the back. Oh, yes. I'm glad to see you're okay. I'm Sam. Samantha. People call me Sam. Well, Samantha, I'm Giselle. Let's get a drink, shall we? - Oh, I-I didn't meant to inter... - Oh. He thinks my name is Bunny. - Okay, but drink's on me. - As you wish. We'll have two martinis. Make 'em dirty. Thank you again. I've never been so scared in my life. If it wasn't for you, I don't know what would've happened. It's okay. I only did what any other woman would do. We have to look out for one another. Protect each other. That guy really did a number on your shirt, didn't he? Yeah. My shirt. It's in the trash now. - Did you call the cops? - No. Um, I thought about it a hundred times. Probably for the best. That piece of shit would have been out in a month anyway. Personally, jerks like that, I like to see them all dead. To the jerks being dead. Well, there is a thing called due process. - Wait. You a lawyer? - Mm-hmm. Please don't tell me you defend trash like that. Oh, God, no. Divorce, family law, over at Blackwell. No wonder why you didn't call the cops. You make good money? Um. I guess I do all right. Okay, then... to doing all right. Do you know of that little boutique down on Sixth? Val's? - No. - You should check them out. Or I can take you. I'm really grateful to you, Giselle. If there's anything else I can do to repay you... Actually, there is. I could use a lift home. - I'm downtown. - Yeah. I'd be more than happy to. Well, this is me. You sure you're gonna be safe? Yeah. I'll be fine. You wanna come up? Make sure I'm okay? Uh, no, I, I-I should get home. Come on, I'm sure you're hungry by now. I make a mean pasta dish. I promise, it will be worth it. Welcome. You're here by yourself? Only with you. This is a great place. You an artist? Mm, I guess you can say that. I'm still working on my masterpiece. Get comfortable. - Wine? - Yes, thank you. This is really great stuff. Thank you. - Meat? - Excuse me? Do you eat meat? Oh, yes. Thank you. I kinda lied. It's from a great Italian place down the street. So here I am, suspended 50 feet in the air overlooking the Piazza Navona, doing my finest rendition of a sexy goddess and, snap, there goes my harness. Oh, my God! You must have been terrified. I mean, a little. But that wasn't even the scariest part. The scariest part was being surrounded by the greatest carbs in the world and not being able to touch a single one. Mm, I can only imagine. After that I quit modeling and I committed myself to eating pasta at least once a week. Mm. Thank you for the meal. I really needed that. Can I get you more or something else? - No, I should go. - Already? Yeah. - Here. - Oh, I don't. Come on, don't be a baby. I mean, you're fully grown. I just haven't done it in a while, I just... That is stronger than I remember from college. - It's good stuff. - Oh... college. So many lifetimes ago. I got pregnant in college with my son. And now he's graduating from high school and he'll be off himself soon. God. I won't know what to do without him. He's, he's my entire life, you know, outside of my work. And the kicker is, he blames me for the divorce. Hm. If he only knew it was his father, he's the one who checked out a long time ago... betrayed the family. And then there's the guys at work. Not a respectable bone in any of 'em. Like, right now we're working a really high-profile case... I can't say who it is. Jaden Turk. Oh, God, I shouldn't have said that. I-I'm just rambling, but it feels so good to unload and... This is Samantha Connelly. Yes, I can talk right now. How did you get my personal number? Well, long story short, another woman is threatening to step forward that she and Mr. Turk had relations while he was still married. That just adds fuel to Mrs. Turk's fire. - Any truth to it? - Turk says no. But does it matter? Like I said from the beginning, let's figure out a nice settlement and make this all go away. I mean... - This is a waste of time. - No. It's not. We, as his team, aren't here to judge what Mr. Turk did in his past. We are here to get him the best possible deal moving forward. That? How do you propose that? Another ya... Excuse me, I'm speaking. Did you know that Jaden supported her entire family while married, and still does? Actually, helping her two younger brothers through college right now. Why didn't we know any of this? Jaden didn't wanna drag her family into it. - He cares about them. - It doesn't matter. What Turk does with her family is his own choice. It has got nothing to do with her. Did you speak with our client directly? He reached out to me. Check my call log. He said this whole thing lacked a female's touch. Shall I move forward, Monty? Please. Yes. More than makes up for you skipping out on our weekend session. That's what I'm talking about, boys. Where are your balls? Not in this room! Okay... Oh. Sam, I've been dying to share this recipe with you. It's called Hong Kong Milk Tea Tiramisu and I know you love Beltane. If you love it... Um, I've gotta take this. - Uh. Hello? - Hey. I'm in the lobby. Can you come out? You're here? In my lobby? Yeah, I was in the neighborhood. Be right out. That's a nice color on you. Thank you. So, how are you? I'm having the best day. Yeah? I'm the new lead on a big case. After I left the other night, our client calls completely out of the blue. He's not satisfied with the other attorneys on the team, but he's willing to give us another shot if I take the lead. Because he was looking for a female's touch? Yes. Wait. You know Jaden Turk? Please, if you have a nice set of tits in this town, you're Jaden Turk's friend. Everyone knows that. You called him. Why? When I look at you, I see two women. One, successful, driven. The other, lonely, scared... beatdown. You're a strong, beautiful woman. Always remember that. Now, can you get out of here? I have a little surprise planned. I promised my son I'd drop his gear at practice. - I can meet you after. - I don't mind. I'd love to meet Tony. How do you know my son's name? Must've been all that pillow talk. Bro. Mom, what the hell? I'm late for practice. Do you know how many laps I'm gonna have to do? Don't start. You know how traffic gets at this time. - Hey. - Hi. Well, son, when are you coming home? Thursday? Uh, I-I can come home tonight if you want. Is your, um, i-is your friend staying for... Tony. Thursday. Come home after school. ...to bring you anything home? Do you like wine or... Tony, I thought you said you were late for practice. It-it was nice meeting you. See you Thursday! - Cute kid. - I'm sorry. He's not the brightest in the bunch, but a good kid. - You have any? - Me? No. No, no kids. But it must be nice. Close family, big house. Well, as they say, the grass is always greener. Hm. Not from where I'm sitting. Ooh, I love this piece. Like, a little red bra... This is really pretty on your skin color. - They have another color! - Yes. That's perfect. Damn! You look good. I love it! Oh, wow. I can't afford this. Oh, I know that you can afford this. Fancy job, rich ex-husband. Not everyone gets that. Yeah, you're forgetting a house mortgage, son going to expensive university. I'm just saying you're worth it. Are you not worth it? Well, say it with me. I'm worth it. I'm worth it. Yes. Work it. If it's too much for you, I'll gladly put a few things back. Excuse me, sweetheart? Just trying to be helpful, ma'am. And you were saying? Oops! - Giselle. - Stop or I'll call the police. And say what? Someone dropped a blouse on the floor? Go ahead. But at the end, you'll still have to pick it all up. Stop. Or you can politely apologize to my friend here. No. I didn't do anything. Oh, but you did. You're just too inexperienced to realize it. Um, let's just finish the transaction and go, hm? So you can go home and write a strongly-worded Yelp review? If you do that, this little shit wins. Don't ever disrespect me again. Or any woman that's paying money to this shop that supplies your paycheck. I'm sorry. Now, don't we all feel a lot better? Yes. Thank you. Have a lovely day. Come on, don't be a baby! Whoo! Oh! I don't know how you do it. - What, tequila? - No. You don't care about consequences. You do whatever you want. Have I not taught you anything? All actions have consequences. You should know that better than anyone. What matters is how you navigate them. I'll have to admit, it sure felt good standing up to that little wench. I know it did. - Ooh. Hello. - Oh. - He comes in here all the time. - Hm. - He's so handsome. - Okay. Well, prove it to me I haven't been wasting my time with you. Ooh. Oh, well... Yes, go get him, tiger. Hello, sailor, wanna buy me a drink? - Excuse me? - One for me and one for... - Me. - Oh. Hello. I'm Giselle. This is my friend Samantha. All right, well, Giselle, Samantha. I'm Miles. Miles Beck. What brings you in here, Miles? Uh, just, uh, meeting some friends for a couple of drinks. - Nothing special. - Mm. Well, Samantha and I were thinking about getting out of here soon. Oh, yeah? Where to? I don't know, somewhere quiet, private, secluded. Maybe you should come with us. Just might turn that nothing special into something you'll never forget. That depends on where it's at. My lake house. - Well, this is nice! - Thank you. One of the benefits of my divorce. No cell service? Well, there's a landline over there if you need it. Hey. So is this what you do? Just lure men out here? Am I gonna be part of a sacrifice or something or, uh, are y'all part of a coven? You'll have to wait and see. The night is still young! Heads or tails? What do I gain to win? Or lose? I mean, it's heads or tails. Where can you really go wrong? - Let's start with heads, then. - Heads it is. You win. Your faces, priceless. But you did win a prize. What will it be? What will it be? I know. Let's dance. Whoo! Mm, mm, come on! You know you want to. This is so not what I wanted to do. Yeah, you do. You like it. Oh, please. Where are you going? I don't know. Maybe to the moon! Is something funny? I just don't do this. I mean, Giselle can really push you to limits you wouldn't believe. Well, I'm glad I came out here, then. Well, how do you know we won't still sacrifice you? Well, it's totally worth it. Giselle is pretty hard to resist. Well, I really didn't come out here for her. I mean, you know, she's pretty and all, but... I came out here for you. I think I'm going to head to bed. - Oh. - Already? Are you sure? - We just got here. - I'm tired. Well, wait. Let me fix up a room for you. She's dear to me, so be careful. Hey, what's up? - You okay? - Yeah. Come, sit. I'm proud of you. You're becoming the woman that I know that you are. You're becoming a masterpiece. I don't know about all that. Reminds me of my favorite fairy tale. Do you know of The Goose Girl? Um, no. I don't think I do. There was a queen who sends her daughter off to marry a prince in a faraway land. She makes a charm out of her own blood to protect her loving daughter and sends her out with a maid and a talking horse. A talking horse? It's a fairy tale. Along the way, the maid stopped taking orders from the princess. A very thirsty princess stops at a river to get a drink of water, and her mother's charm falls into the river and gets swept away. Left unprotected, the maid sees her chance and forces the princess to swap clothes with her and swear an unbreakable oath that she would never tell a soul of her true identity. And if she does, the maid will murder her. That's lovely. When they get to the faraway kingdom, the maid introduces herself as the princess and the real princess is forced to work tending to geese. The maid marries the king's son, now she's paranoid, and she has the talking horse slaughtered. The king catches wind of the girl who talks to the horse's skull, and asks her her story. Then the princess marries the king's son and the maid is flung into a spiked barrel and dragged around the city until she dies. That's so dark. - Why is that your favorite? - I don't know. Everyone was so worried about the princess. But what about the maid? Maybe her life was awful, maybe she saw her chance... and she needed him more. Or maybe I just like talking horses. Ah. Can you transfer the Johnson case to Jim? I can't handle it right now. Well, hello to you, too. Sorry. Hello. This whole Turk litigation has got me upside down. Are you sure it's only that, Sammy girl? When we're here, can we drop the whole Sammy girl? Sam or Samantha is fine. Okay, Samantha. We still going out for tapas tonight, Samantha? Kiki, I can't. I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so slammed. Can we raincheck? Yeah, I guess you are all right with your fancy new duds and your fancy new friends. - You got a message. - Thanks. Oh. - Uh, raincheck okay? - Yeah. I gotta grab Monty real quick. We good? Mm-hmm. Fun... Hi, Mark! No cowards allowed, Samantha. This is a private event, and it's safe. We are not gonna let that POS dictate your life, okay? - Plus, you look gorgeous. - I don't know. This dress, this... Look, maybe this was a bad idea. Stop it. Here, put this on. - Hey, Jaden. - Giselle. It's always good to see you. Likewise. Who is your gorgeous friend? This is my friend Samantha Connelly from Blackwell. Actually, the two of you might have met before. Ms. Connelly. Mr. Turk, please call me Sam. And we haven't met, but it is a pleasure. The pleasure's all mine. Jaden, we came here tonight to have a good time. You shall. - Show us the bar? - Absolutely. Follow me, ladies. I should not be here. Relax. You're just a sexy woman having a good time. - Are you crazy? - Honestly, Samantha. If Jaden invited one of the male attorneys, you don't think they'll be here? Don't be so naive. Do you know how many friends Jaden Turk has? High-profile friends? You're here networking. Seize it. Damn it. You're right. I'm tired of picking up after other people. It's time I put myself first for once. Yes. Who the hell are you? The question is, who are you? Let's find out. Okay! What did you say your name was, again? It doesn't even matter. Hey, what? What? I'm sorry. I-I have to go. Wasn't quite what I meant by networking, but... You saw that? Sweetheart, I see it all. God, I'm so stupid! I could lose my job, my creditability... - And where the hell were you? - Calm down, Samantha. I know Jaden. He won't remember you or what happened. - Trust me. - He remembers you. I just wanted my friend to have a good time. Admit it. You felt like a sexy bitch, didn't you? Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. - Yeah, here she is. - Hello? I haven't heard from you, Samantha. Uh, sorry. I've been swamped. How did you get this number? Listen, I was thinking we could do something tonight. Just me and you. Oh, um, I-I can't. I, I have a work party. Oh, great! I-I love parties. I'm taking Miles. Giselle? No. That's great. You guys been seeing each other? Yeah, a little. That's great, Samantha. Call me when you free up. Hey, Kiki. Miles, this is Kiki. Kiki, this is Miles. - Miles. - Pleasure to meet you, Kiki. - You two known each other long? - Yeah, you could say that. I used to be the old shoulder to cry on until she moved on to bigger and better things. Isn't that right, Samantha? No, Kiki. I-it's not like that. Nice to meet you, Miles. What was that about? Oh, she's a great person, but a little bit clingy, you know? - Oh. - I see my boss. - I wanna introduce you. - Mm. Monty. I wanna introduce you to my date, Miles Beck. - Miles. A pleasure. - Pleasure's mine. You certainly have your hands full with this one. - So far so good. Mm. - Mm. Oh, uh, and let me introduce you to my new assistant. Please, uh, meet Giselle. Giselle, this is Sam, my top attorney. - And, uh... - Miles. Miles, yes. - Hello, Sam... Samantha? - Mm. - Miles. Nice to meet you both. - Yeah. Giselle was, uh, kind enough to accompany me to the party. Uh, I'm, I-I'm sorry, there are a few people I need to talk with before they leave. - So, nice to meet you. - Mm-hmm. What do you think you're doing? Well? What do you have to say for yourself? Oh, relax. I needed a job. And I kinda like Monty. This is not a game. This is my life. So you can have the good job and a nice car, but I can't? What are you talking about? Look at you! You can have whatever you want, work where you want, but not here! I did it so we can be close. Remember, I know secrets about you that no one else does? - Dark ones. - Don't do that. And it looks like Miles is treating you nice. - Look at you, glowing... - Please don't. What is this? After all that I've done? Look at you? Your clothes and Jaden. - Miles... - Monty is my boss. - This is my work. - And now it's my work, too. This way we can have a lot more fun together. Well, maybe I'm tired of your reckless fun. I think we should take a break from this friendship. Okay. Fine. Hey, Kiki, how are you? Okay. Look, I know I haven't been available to you lately, and I'm sorry about that. Okay. I know you've been busy. But I do miss you, Sam. Maybe next week let's do something fun. Sounds good. I'm just working on the details of your presentation. Anything else? No. Thank you. This bitch is a damn ghost. Hey, Tony, come in here. I want you to meet someone. Hey, Tony. Heard a lot about you, man. Hi, nice to meet you. See you later. - Okay, be home by 11:00. - I will! - I mean it, Tony. - I promise! - 11:00! - Okay! So, how's it been going working with Giselle? - Awkward as hell. - Hm. Yo, I left the sauce in the car. No worries, I'll get it. Give me the keys. - All right, you ready? - Mm-hmm. Okay. - Mm, boom. - Hey. - All right, here you go. - Thank you very much. You want me to do the garlic bread? Oh, no, no, it's already in the oven. - Salad ready? - Yup. No worries. What the... - Hey, you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Uh, just-just a little jittery. All right, all right. Well, where's your breaker box? Um, in the basement down the hall. Okay. All right. - Just stay right here, okay? - Okay. All right. All right, well, uh, just try one. Oh. There we go. - Oh, Miles? - Well, something... Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down, it's okay. I just saw someone outside in a mask. - What mask? Saw who? - Uh, the Venetian mask. I-I've seen it before. I don't know what kinda game this is, but I'm calling the cops. Okay, um, well, we'll be on patrol for the rest of the night, counselor. But like I said, it's a fairly common prank by teenagers. Unless, uh, you have a reason to suspect anyone else. I'm tired of waiting! Just shut up! Um, a few weeks ago I had an incident. What kind of incident? I... went to that new bar downtown, the Hi-Ball. I met a man and, um... he was forcing himself on me. And before he could go any further, a-another woman came and hit him over the head with a pipe or something. One of your friends? No, um... A-a stranger. Uh, uh, did you call it in? Counselor, you of all people should've called that in. I know. I've just been going through a lot. It's not something I wanted to expose. Yeah. Well, can you describe him? Muscular, 6'2-ish. Uh, white. He seemed to know quite a few people there. You got a name? Clay. I don't know his last name. Hold on a second. You know better than I do that I'm not supposed to be showing you this. But, uh, is that the guy? Mm-hmm. Yes, that's him. Oh, my God, what did he do? He was murdered. Beaten to death a couple of days ago. So pretty sure it wasn't him. - Did you catch who did it? - There's a suspect. Uh, he owed a lot of people money. I mean, that's really all I can say. Unless you know something we don't, counselor. No. Only what I told you. Okay, um, well, listen, I'm really sorry about what happened to you, Ms. Connelly. But as to tonight, it's like I said before, it's usually a prank around here. So try to enjoy the rest of your night. - Hm. - Let's go. Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. All right? I promise. I'mma be here for you, no matter what. You mean that, Miles? I haven't heard that in a long time. I promise. Hey, look at you. Breakfast of champions, huh? - Good morning! - Good morning! What are you doing here? Hey, Tony, you want a ride to school? - Sure, yeah, yeah. - Come on. - Bye, mom. - See you later. Are you the princess, Samantha? Or are you the maid? Terrence, good to see you again. - Jaden, always a pleasure. - Oh, my God. Yes, sir. Uh, I wanna introduce Samantha Connelly. - Mr. Turk, a pleasure. - Pleasures all mine. Have we met before? I-I don't think so. Forgive me, man. I done took so many blows to the head, I can barely remember most things, you know? - Uh, shall we? Yeah. - Yeah, let's do it. Why don't you take a seat next to Jim, and we'll get started. - Hey. - How's it goin', brother? My guy. - Good to see you, boss. - What's up, bro? All right, let's do it. In this presentation, we present our proposed defense. Mr. Turk has a generally positive reputation on and off the field. We plan to lean into his volunteer services within the community to show that he is a stand-up citizen. Through our trusted partnership with private detectives, we can show that Mr. Turk's ex-wife hasn't exactly been in remorse over their marriage. I like that. That's good. Yo! Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell is this, man? - Kiki! - Yo! No, what is this shit? - Kiki, do something! - I... It's locking me out! Yo, hey! Y'all trying to blackmail me for my money? - Huh? Is that what this is? - No. Please... give me anything to make me understand what did this firm do to you to prompt this vindictiveness. We are potentially... looking at a major lawsuit. Giselle. - Excuse me? - She did this, Monty. She forced you to screw Jaden publicly, photographed it, then waited for the right moment to project it. Did she also twirl her fake mustache as well? I did not screw Jaden. Look, I know it sounds crazy. You want to tell me why you were harassing her in the bathroom at my party? We have a witness who saw you confronting her. I'd be very careful about throwing around wild accusations. Thankfully, Jaden's team is eager to make this all go away quietly. You're an intelligent, driven attorney, Sam. I think you know how this ends. If it were me, I'd retain counsel immediately. - Monty, please, just... - Please, see yourself out. All this aside... I beg of you to be careful with her. Admit it. You felt like a sexy bitch, didn't you? - You saw that? - Sweetheart, I see it all. - What's up? - Is Giselle here? - Who? - Giselle. There's no one with that name here. Sorry. Uh, Bunny? - You know her? - Yeah. She's a friend. A friend, right. She's no longer here. Where is she? I don't know, man. I, I let her stay at my place for a bit. She still owes me money. So if you do find her, could you let her know, please? - Sure. - Thanks. Good luck. Oh, my God! - Is that really them? - Yeah. They were so cute. I love it. Hey, mom, I'm showing Giselle old photos of you and dad from college. What are you doing in my house? Samantha, I heard what happened, and I was worried about you, so I came over to check on you. And Tony was kind enough to keep me company. You need to leave my house now before I call the police. - Wait, mom... - Tony, go outside. Now! - Mom! - Now! Monty is one thing, but that is my son. My son! You will leave him alone. Now get out of my house! Samantha, have you gone mad? Do you really think I would cross that line? I mean, Tony's like a nephew... He is not your nephew. I like this new you. It's sexy. But let's be honest, Samantha. Your behavior these past few weeks hasn't been exemplary. Berating store clerks, inappropriate conduct with your A-list clients. Thank you for everything you've done for me. But now I think it's time to focus on my family, my work... And where does that leave me? I thought we were supposed to be there for one another. - Protect each other. - Oh, Giselle or Bunny... Whatever your name is... get the hell out of my house! I love this. I'm worth it. Hey! Oh, my God! How did you get in here? Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I knocked a few times. The door was open. So you just let yourself in? Babe, what's goin' on here? It's very convenient that you and Giselle wandered into my life practically at the same time. - You two running a scam on me... - What? Babe, I don't even know... How do I know that? I tell you, life was a lot more simple and better before you two. Hey, stop, stop. You're being hurtful. Uh, I'm not teamed up with Giselle. Okay? So just tell me, what happened? I got fired today. And throwing away your clothes is gonna help you out... These clothes... This isn't me. I'm not that person. - I think you should go. - Seriously? Come on, Sam, everything is gonna be all right. - I promise. - Please. I can't. I can't right now. I need you to leave! All right. No, I want them sued for everything they got! All right? Uh, yes! I understand we gotta keep a low profile for the line. But I don't care, okay? No! No! No, you listen to me, Calvin. You just make it happen, all right? And, look, I want that female lawyer disbarred. I don't care if you got to ruin her damn life. You just make it happen, all right? Hello, this is Samantha Connelly. Please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Giselle, what are you doing here? What can I say? I miss my friend. - I gotta go. - Wait, wait, wait. I-I... I just wanna know if she's okay. - Okay? - Yes. You know, all that stuff that you did to Sam, she'd never do to you in a million years. - You know that, right? - I'm not doing anything to her. I-I don't wanna hurt her. I have nothing more to say to you. Hey, this is Miles. Leave a message. Come on, Miles, answer. Miles? Miles. Miles, you awake? I'm so sorry about earlier today. My head was not on the level, it... Miles? Miles? So you unlocked the door and just walked right in? Yes. How many times do I have to go over it? Come on, counselor, you know the routine. You seriously think I had something to do with this? - I'm just asking questions. - Questions? You broke into his house at 3:15 a.m. There are signs of forced entry at the rear. Yeah, questions. If you're gonna arrest me, officer, do it now. If not, do trust that I know what my rights are. No doubt, counselor. Also, the suspect, Clay Davis' murder, cleared. So we're still lookin' for his killer. I wouldn't venture too far, Ms. Connelly. - Hello? - Hey. I'm going away for a few days, so listen. I know I haven't been a good mother these past few weeks. Hell, these past few years. - I-I just wanted to tell... - I love you, mom. I love you, too, Tony. Well, I'm glad I came out here, then. I came out here for you. Hey, Sam. - Kiki. - Hey, Sammy. - What are you doing here? - Well... I stopped by your house, and you weren't there. - So figured you'd be up here. - You figured right. You're the one person who knows more about me than anyone. Sam, I know you didn't hurt anybody. And I came here to tell you that. Thank you, Kiki. Not everyone shares your opinion. I went from being a PTA mom to a person of interest. But I don't even care. I just wish Miles were here. Do they have any leads? No. Okay, I have to tell you something. And I don't know if it means anything or if it'll help. - But... - What? All right, I'm just gonna say. The night your boyfriend died, I saw him. He was coming out of that bar around the corner from the office, The Old Sparrow. That's not a surprise. I, I kicked him out. Well, Monty's assistant was there. - I saw her approach his car. - Giselle? W-what happened? Did-did they leave together? No, they seemed to argue a bit. But as far as I could tell, Miles drove off alone. Kiki, it's not a coincidence that all of this is happening. We need to go to the police now! Let me go. I'll tell them what I saw. I mean, if we go together, they'll just think you put me up to it or something. - Hm. - Let me handle it. - Like I always do. - Okay. Thank you, Kiki. Really. That's okay, Sam. I'm glad you're back. You're gonna be okay up here alone? Ah, no one knows I'm here. Just Tony and the police. And Tony's with his father. I'm really sorry for how I acted. Selfishly. I promise, I won't ever be that person again. That's okay, Sam. I forgive you. Hello? Giselle! What are you doing here? - You need to leave now! - Listen to me. I've been looking all over for you. - You're in danger. - You need to leave! I know that you talked to Miles the night he was murdered. Yes, I talked to Miles, but you were upset and I wanted to make sure you were okay. Lies, they're all lies coming out of your mouth. - No! - Did you murder him? - I had nothing to do with that. - Right. - Just like the photos? - What photos, Samant... How stupid do you think I am? My presentation. You ruined my career! No, I did not! Listen to me. I have something to show you, okay? It will all make sense, I promise. Just follow me. Where's Kiki? Kiki! What have you done? Listen to me, Sam. I may do things in my own weird way, but I am not a killer. Why would I wanna see you fail? I-I built you up! I made you, sweetheart. Listen to how crazy you sound. Do you even hear yourself? Hang on, Kiki. Untie her now! What would I have to gain to see you lose your career? Miles! Huh? Once I stopped listening to you, you couldn't take it. You're a control freak, you're obsessed. And you tried to frame me for Miles' murder. The setup for Miles' murder wasn't meant for you. It was meant for me, you going over to his place wasn't accounted for, but I was seen talking to him. You crazy bitch. Untie her now! - Ah! - Kiki, are you okay? She tried to kill me. She's insane! And you're a stalker! Tell her, tell her you saw Miles the night he died. I saw you hiding in your car! The person you should be worried about is standing right behind you. - She's the obsessed one. - Throw me the keys. She wanted you back to the way you were when you were helpless and-and-and alone. - She wants you all to herself. - That is absurd. - You are sick! - I'm not. Okay, how would I have access to your presentation when she prepared it, huh? Don't listen to her, Sam, let's go to the police. Oh, bravo, Kiki. This is what you wanted the whole time. - How you set me up! - Keys! Now! Remember, remember the fairytale that I told you in there? She's the maid. I'm the talking horse. I-I'm your friend. Enough! It's beautiful that you have a family and-and a home, and maybe I wanted to share a little bit of that because I don't have one of my own. But I would never hurt you, Sam. I created you. Do you hear that? You know how crazy she is? - You're crazy! - No, Sam. Do not believe her. You're not believing her, are you? And as soon as you started to spread your wings, she couldn't take it. You think I didn't see you hiding and-and stalking us around town, following us? Why would I? Why would I do that? Because who else do you have? Your little dogs? You don't have any other friends! Sam is the only friend I need! And you don't wanna share her, do you? And especially not with me. Where were you when someone was creepin' around Sam's house? - Where were you? - I was with Monty. Call him, you can ask him for yourself. T-that was just a prank by teenagers. My God! You know, for a-a lawyer, you're super naive. Notice she didn't answer the question. And what about Clay from the bar, huh? You do him in as well? I had nothing to do with that lowlife! Oh, yeah, you did. How do you know about him? I, I-I overheard one of your calls to the police. I never called the police! You killed him, didn't you, Kiki? No, you killed him! I know you did. And you followed us to Jaden's party, too. She's setting me up, I would never do anything to hurt you. Damn, Kiki, you're a cold-blooded murderer. You're not getting away with this. - We have been friends forever! - Oh, give it a rest! Kiki! Stop it! - Sammy, do you believe me? - Stop it, everybody. Leave me! No! Oh, my God! Sammy! Believe me, Sammy. Believe me! Come on, we gotta go. We've gotta go! Come, come on. Come on, Sammy. You know, that was her game. She manipulates. She's a killer. In breaking news, All-Star wide-receiver Jaden Turk was found dead early this morning. Police have launched a full investigation and we will bring you those details as soon as they are released.
