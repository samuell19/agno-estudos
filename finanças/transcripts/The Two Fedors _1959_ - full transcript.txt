I've been disturbed all week As it is. My friend, my friends, What have you done? I loved him-you stole him away- I did not! You scallywag, you said you were gonna get off in two stations. This one's the sixth. You wouldn't have taken me if I had told you the truth. That's true! I'll get off at the next one. - He's nobody's fool. - Absolutely. Oh well, never mind. Keep going if you must. I had worn my shoes all out Walking down that path As soon as I got a new pair My boo found someone else. Our family is huge. In order of seniority: Panteleimon Lukich and Maria Trofimovna, our parents. - Then Zoya, my wife. - She's pretty. Here are my sisters: Darya, Lyudmila, Natalia.

No mother either? Only an aunt. She's nice, but she lives too far away. - Going to see her? - Yep. Once I'm home, I really should fix the bellows. Comrades! Congratulations on this great victory! The truth was on our side, so we won! Thanks. Why so much? - It'll come in handy. - Thank you. - It's too heavy! - Not for you it ain't. - Take care! - Thanks. - Take care, Fyodor. - Say hi to your aunt. Enjoy yourself, soldier, the war is over! - That's us. - Thanks for the ride. - Gonna stay at your aunt's? - Yep. - Can you find the way? - Sure thing. Walk down Shevchenko st., then turn onto Papanin st., then down Komsomolsky alley. The third one's hers. Have a safe trip. Hope everyone's in good health. - Goodbye. - See ya. Take care, guys! - Hey brother, hop in! - Are you staying, Fyodor? Fyodor! - Did you hit the dog? - It's his own fault. Who are you anyway? This is our spot. We always play here. - This is our house! - Wanna get your ass kicked? Let him have it! Hey hey, knock it off! What is it with you? - Fyodor! - Hello, Nikanorych. Alive, thank God. - Is it Arseniy? - Yep. He sure has grown. Well, introduce yourself. - So? - Well, here I am. - Where did you find this mutt? - Mutt my ass! He's a purebred bear-dog. Could've been the size of a calf. - Why isn't he, then? - Why, huh! If you'd been fed like he was, you wouldn't have grown at all. - Oh my God! Hello Fyodor. - Hi. Welcome back, Fyodor! What are we waiting for? Let's go. You can stay with me for the time being. Or maybe at our place. Thank you, friends. But it's my home I've come back to. Hey comrade, only 30 minutes left Until we go on the offensive Hey comrade, only 30 minutes left Until we go on the offensive Just enough to finish one cigarette Before the battle begins And maybe talk about love And dream a little. And maybe talk about love And dream a little Well, let's get started. - Why are you in such a hurry? - I was in line. - Where? - Behind that woman over there. Let him pass, no skin off your back. Some sugar, please. As much as this bill can buy. - Cubes?? Lumps, of course! No one needs the cubes, they're weak. - Next. - So, what I need is... Fyodor, here's someone looking for you! - Borscht? - Hi. Borscht, yes. It's really good. Delicious. And some kasha I made. Grain was rationed out today. And some vitamins for dessert. - Where did you get these? - I know a place. They just grow there like weeds. They're nobody's. Catch up, don't just stand there! - Wait for me, guys! - Catch up! - I'm gonna get me some apples! - But they're still green! - How about cucumbers? - Let's go steal some carrots! Let's go! Hey lady, take it easy! - Next time you'll see! - Why are you getting so testy? None of your business! - What are you staring at? - It ain't against the law, is it? You're too young to look at men like that. Like you're so mature. And this mustache makes you look like a cockroach. Get lost! Next time, come together! Just give me some notice, so I have a switch at the ready! - Stork-girl! Stork-girl! - Get lost, you! Stork-girl! Stork-girl! I thought they didn't belong to anyone. Don't scold me, Fyodor. I've lost all our ration cards. - How? - How do things get lost? Here one moment, gone another. Why did you take them in the first place? I was in charge of groceries. I thought I'd stop by the store after work... - "He thought"! Lose 'em all? - Every single one. What are we gonna do now? Don't you worry, Fyodor. We'll figure something out. We will. Feels so good! Oh you! Why are you so cheerful today, my friend? - What took you so long? I've been waiting. - Oh well. I was busy at work. - We'll be late for our walk. - We'll make it in time. By the way, what is this smell? Jesus Christ! Where did you get it? - Let's drink some "bruth" first. - What? -Chicken "bruth." - Broth, you weirdo. - Same thing. - Not enough salt. - Here's more. - Wings or drumsticks? - Yeah, yeah. Can't even carve it. Piping hot. - So where did you get it? - Borrowed from Gruff. - How do you mean? - It's just a loan. Gruff has as many chickens as we do. No, really. I told him we'd pay him back. As soon as... We will, honest. Did you steal it? You're always hungry. You need some meat. I'm a working man, can't you see? Throw this filthy thing away before it stinks up the place. Let's eat it instead. What's done is done. - We're working men. - I know. - Are we going for a walk? - We are. There's a very interesting article here on page 23. You definitely should read it. It's a great magazine overall. - Hello, Fyodor. - Hello, boys! Hello, Fyodors. Nice weather we're having. Are we gonna just walk around, or maybe see a movie? They're always taking a walk at this hour. Like clockwork, you know. - Let me. - It's alright. One scoop, please. Fyodor! Come here. Can you hear me? There you go. - What about you? - I don't like the stuff. Is it okay? It better be, for 12 rubles. - Should've bought some potatoes instead. - What a practical mind. Come here, Kolya! What's holding you up, guys? Katya, has there been an accident? Katya! What is it, Fyodor? My dad was a tank crewman, too. Along with the monetary reform, effective December 16th, 1947, controlled distribution of goods is now formally abrogated, and so is profiteering.. No more ration stamps! No more stamps! Hey guys, no more ration cards! - Look how high up she got! - Way to go, Stork-girl! Stork-girl! Stork-girl ! - Her apples are real good! - Tomatoes and cucumbers, too! - Her carrots ain't bad either! - What about her switch? Lower away! You see, the rooks are flying in circles again. The city's alive, And the brooks flow babbling forth. Here's where we composed Our first songs, Their beauty in our hearts intact. Only the sleepless nights knew How we lived During those days of turmoil, How we cried When no one was looking.. - Been playing soccer again? - I just fell. Listen up, Fyodor. Look around so no one can see you, and tell me which woman is the most beautiful one here. This one. What about that one with the boots? Don't point your finger. - This is Stork-girl! She ain't no woman. - Oh really? So what? - Nonsense. - Come here, Fyodor! I'll be right back. Don't do that, you'll get run over. - Scoot over, Gruff. - Sit down! The sun's so bright it burns my eyes. - Ever looked at the moon? - I have. Why? - Don't do it anymore. - Why? Sasha The Redhead says it turns you into a sleepwalker. How so? Love comes to us, So why should we fear it? Why should we fear it? Our streets will be in bloom again, The nightingales won't sleep a wink, Young spring has come to town. Spring is back again. Here you go! Let's skedaddle. - Let's go to the dance. - But we were gonna see a movie. It's gonna be a blast! Semenych's gonna wave his baton around. Let him wave. Oh come on! It's so much fun. - I'll make you take dance lessons when you grow up. - What for? You may need it one day. Wait here. Be right back. - Hello Fyodor! - Hi Stepan! Sorry, gotta run. - Semenych! - Hello, Fyodor! I got a favor to ask. I'm gonna walk up to this girl. Shush! Stop as soon as I'm there. But of course! You got it. Enough. Ready? - Shall we dance? - I'm tired. Do you wanna dance? - Hello. - Hello. - My name's Fyodor. - I'm Natasha. - Shall we dance? - Sure. - I'm kind of rusty. - You'll get the hang of it. Like this. Let's go for a walk. The weather is nice. - Let me introduce you. - We have met. We see each other sometimes in my garden. I believe we've had a couple of run-ins. Don't be mad at me! I'm not mad. It's your right. - I'll give you a basketful of apples. - I'll accept. Go see a movie, sport. Take Arseniy the Gruff with you. Okay? - What about you? - I'll join you guys later. Goodbye. Fyodor! - Fyodor! - What? Go home! What are you doing up? - What is it? - I wanted to tell you something. Well? - I forget. I'll remember in the morning. - You're a strange one. Is it clear? Now scram. Hold on! - Go, you'll be late for work. - Don't worry, I'll get there in 2 min. We're going to the movies tonight. - It's called "Arshin mal alan." - Arshin what? We'll see. What is it, boy? You see, Fyodor, something's happened. I love her. Just fell in love with her, is all. I want her to live here. With us. What do you say? Wake up, Fyodor. Does it matter what I say? Well, I don't mind. Attaboy! Don't be sad, Fyodor! We'll have even more fun together, the three of us! Can you imagine what kind of living it's gonna be? Why are you looking that way? Oh, that's why. You see, Fyodor, I really couldn't get away. It's really important, you see? How can I explain it? No need to explain. It's been a while since we took our last walk. Stay here, don't worry. I'm used to walking by myself. Rain check, huh? Why are you eating it? It's cold. Don't you worry, Fyodor. I happen to like my borscht cold. Come off it, Fyodor. It's gonna be better this way. Okay, let her come! - Please. - Thank you. - Why aren't you eating anything? - And you? I'll have some. Here you go, Pirate. Suit yourself. Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! - Enough, brothers. - Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! ...before the battle begins And talk about love And dream a little... Our soldier has been under fire More than once, He charged forward boldly. He was burning in a tank, Burning he was, But burn he did not. Hey you, birdie on the wing Hey you, my hometown, You're so pretty! My dove, my love... Time to hit the hay, my friend. How does it feel? Such a lovely bed. Go to sleep. What? Why did you shave off your beautiful mustache? Go to sleep. It'll grow back. Like this. Sleep! Good night. How the soldier advanced toward Berlin through many a battle... It' time for a song to ring out. Fyodor, what's up with you? - Fyodor! - Well, take care. Goodbye, Fyodor. - Is she mean to you? - Not really. Except they don't need me. Gruff, I'm gonna leave for Siberia to live with my aunt. My aunt is a good person. Winter's almost here, wait it out. Or stay with us for good. So that's the problem? Are you gonna go to school tomorrow? - We are. - Go to bed then. It's past nine. Go home, Fyodor. Arseniy will clean up the mess. Uncle Ivan, I'd rather spend the night. We really have to finish building this plane. If I leave, we'll both oversleep. And we really have to finish building this plane. Because the fair is coming up. Good, then. The plane is ready, ain't it? It only looks like it is. But it isn't, really. That's right, Uncle Ivan! Not at all ready. We must finish tomorrow morning. Apply the paint... Alright, you can stay. Tell your folks, though. No need. They won't worry. Fyodor is working tonight anyway. Okay, you can stay. Let me! Let it go! Something's going on in that house. I gotta talk to Fyodor. They're both nice people. What's with the boy? I don't get it. - Want some tea? - Sure. - Natasha is so pretty. The hell she is. So skinny and all. - Her hair is lovely. - Who cares. What do you mean? Hair's important. She's cast a spell over y'all with her hair. If you had hair like hers, I'd marry you right away. Are you gonna drink tea? Fyodor! Fyodor! Are you asleep? Why are you doing this? I know you're awake. So you're kicking me out, huh? Want me gone? Where can I go if I love you both so much? Silly. How can I live without you? I just can't. It's like we had a fight. We haven't even had a decent talk. Maybe I am to blame. When Fyodor's back, we'll talk it over the three of us. We can't have fights. And we won't. Go to sleep and don't say anything, okay? - Good morning! - Good morning. What's keeping you, brother? Shake a leg. - Just a sec. -How are you, Natasha? - I'm ready! Hurry up, Natasha dear! There. Fyodor, don't forget to polish your shoes. Till they shine, you see. Oh dammit. Haste, as they say, makes waste. Why are you so glum so early in the morning? - I'm almost done ironing. - Busy beaver, huh. - What's this? - Do you like it? - What is it for? - Makes it easier. So? Hold on, Fyodor. I can explain. - What are you doing? - Fyodor! You idiot! Train 3 is on track 12. The next cut is the 14th. - Well, so long. - See you. - Don't be a stranger. -Sure. - Likewise. Don't you wanna stay? - Winter's coming. - I must go, Gruff. OK, lemme give you a boost. Let's eat, then. Natasha! Have you been cleaning? - What? -Can't find my gas mask container. - Haven't touched it. Okay. - Where are you off to? - It's almost dinnertime. I'm gonna drop by Nikanorych's. - Nikanorych, step out for a sec. - Hello. - Is the boy at your place? - Nope. Why? - No reason. -He must be at school. Arseniy told us about that fair. They're presenting their plane. - Dmitry, gimme the ball! - Come on, Dmitry! Mikhail, go home. - So? - What do you want from me? - Where's Fyodor Jr.? - I don't know. - Arseniy, where's Fyodor? - No idea. - Feel like some ass whooping? Where's Fyodor? -Not telling ya. He's gone. For good. For Siberia, where his aunt lives. He's got no aunt, it's a lie! My boy's missing. He's blond. Short, snub-nosed a bit. He says he's going to his aunt's. Lt. Yevchenko on duty. Hello. I see. Okay. - Last name? - Karpenyuk. Fyodor Karpenyuk. - Fyodor Jr., right? - Have you seen him? I've heard of him. That's what people call you: The Two Fyodors. He says he's off to see his aunt. It's a lie, he's got no aunt. Don't you worry, we'll take care of it. A bogie tank wagon on track 15... Look closely! Be on the lookout. Attention, signalmen!
