Woman: Bless me, father, for i have sinned. It has been a day since my last confession. I saw Agnes Dunn as I was entering the dry cleaners, and took the lord's name in vain. I disrespected sister Joan by daydreaming in our lady's altar society meeting. I believed it was the lesser of two evils. Often, when I pay attention to what she's saying, I begin to have doubts. For this, and so much more, I am terrified I am going to hell. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The blood of Christ. The body of Christ. ( Loudly ) The blood of Christ. The body of Christ. The blood of Christ. - The body of Christ. - The blood of Christ. The body of Christ. Mrs. cleary, is something wrong? I lost a contact. I had that Lasik procedure two years ago. It changed my life. I'm glad to find you alone. As you know, this is the time of year we nominate women for the catholic woman of the year award. Well, I want you. Thank you, monsignor. Oh, don't be thankin' me yet. Sister Joan nominated Agnes Dunn. Agnes Dunn? The rest of the committee is divided. So sister Joan suggested an outside party make the decision. I offered bishop Donnelly. Oh. Head of catholic families together. Exactly. That's where you're strong. You have the perfect family. We'll need frank and the kids to provide letters of recommendation when they meet with bishop Donnelly. Meet with him? Oh, yes, yes, at the in-home visit. That holds the most weight in the decision. - Oh. - Oh, Mrs. cleary. I've been blessed to take tea at your home. You could eat off the floors. Thank you, monsignor. Oh, I probably shouldn't divulge this, because it hasn't been announced yet, but we're to have a special guest at the ceremony. The archbishop of Dublin. - Oh! - Yes. The archbishop himself will offer our most holy sacrament to the winner. The prayer of absolution. All sins forgiven. ( Phone rings ) Hey, ma. ( Whispering ) Monsignor Murphy has nominated me for catholic woman of the year. That's great, ma. No one does more for the church than you. Why are you whispering? Oh, um... ( Normal voice ) I'm still in church. It's a sin to boast. It's Thursday. Why are you still at church? Look, ma, I have to... I'm gonna be late for work. ( Whispering ) No caffeine. So we'll use the good China tonight to celebrate. Celebrate? The nomination. Shannon, I really wish you would stop with the emails when I'm talking to you. This is important. Ma, I'm really happy for you, but I have to leave for work. All right. Dinner will be at 7:00. My youth ministry class got pushed back an hour. Fine. And Mr. o'Riley can't have any red meat. His cholesterol is too high for the living now. These are vegetable tamales, Mrs. cleary. Here. I made you one. Lord Jesus, be our guest, that this food to us be blessed. Amen. Amen. Mmm! I told you. How do I make these? Well, I have ay chaparita. - Is something the matter? - My daughter marcella. Oh, my! Are we serving the homebound cobbed corn? Um... tamales wrapped in corn husks. And they are delicious. Oh. Well, wrap them up, because sister Joan suggested that I take over Megan O'Donnell's route since her mother's in hospice. Mmm. Is she at meridian? I have a prayer meeting there this week, I could look in on her. I have no idea. Did you hear the good news? What good news? Makes me think about the third grade when we were both considered to lead the may procession, and then again, in high school. Both considered to play Mary in the Christmas pageant. Agnes and I have been nominated for catholic woman of the year. Ah! Congratulations! And now, here we are again. I have to be going. I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope you win this time. * it's a perfect day ( humming along to radio ) * it's a perfect day * it's a perfect day for you and me... * ( humming continues ) * it's a perfect day these tamales better not be too salty. Congratulations on your nomination. Mrs. punch, how on earth do you know about that? O'Riley calls us all after you leave. He's more reliable than the evening news. You know you're a shoo-in. How do you figure that? Agnes Dunn's cousin married a protestant. ( Both laughing ) Every time something good is about to happen to me, Agnes Dunn pops up. Who lives a more divine life than you? You do so much for the church, it makes St. Nicholas blush. Oh, Mary! Every day mass, ministry to shut-ins, meals on wheels. There isn't a person from two to 92 you don't preach god's blessings. Thank you. Even mama would've been proud. She never had a kind word for me. I didn't say she would tell you she was proud. Mmm. She'd probably say, ( Irish accent ) "Most people get this award sooner or later, Eileen, but most of them get it a lot sooner." Well, wouldn't you be proud if Shannon got an award like that? Oh, that's different. Shannon and I get along great. - Gonna eat that? - Go ahead. So Nick asked me if we're both wearing tuxedos. Oh, no. He is so uninvited. - Was he serious? - Mm-hmm. Oh, my god. When do I get to see you in your dress? I told you, I'm traditional. You're gonna have to wait. So unfair. My mom gets to see you, and I don't. Not fair. Sorry. Speaking of mothers... I know I... I keep thinking that there'll be a moment that feels right, but... I know. I have to tell her. I mean, it's bordering on ridiculous at this point. How about you come with me to dinner tonight? Tonight? Yes. Hmm. What? I'm just trying to picture it. Me at the cleary family dinner for the first time in six years. I could come for dessert. - That sounds perfect. - Okay. I have to go. I'm super behind on those spring street grants. Right. I love you. It's gonna be fine. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Bye. Frank! I've got news. I've been nominated for catholic woman of the year. Yeah? That's great. What's wrong? Patty called. He left her again. He'll be back. Lord Jesus, please. Help our son frank junior to stop being an idiot and go back to his wife and children. Amen. Where is he? You need to stay out of it. - He's ruining his life. - It's his life. You need to let him make his own decisions. Oh, is that what you were busy doing when he got Patty pregnant in high school? We shouldn't have pushed him into marrying somebody he didn't love. He's got another woman? It won't last. He's not like you, frank. Who is she? Theresa hennessey. The manicurist? What is it? There's some bag lady staring at us. - Uh... - What? - Just one second. - Where you going? I'll just be right back. Oh, no. Oh, no! Ma, what the hell are you doin' here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? I am not discussing this with you. She's older than you are. You can't even have a mid-life crisis right. Who's gonna teach the boys how to drive? Ma, I am leaving Patty, I'm not moving to Siberia. You didn't tell monsignor Murphy, did you? Why the hell would I tell him? Because if you want marriage counseling, monsignor Murphy isn't very good at it. I think you should go to another priest, maybe another parish. Ma, my marriage is over. It's been over a long time. You took a vow. Once you say something, you can't take it back. Once you do something, you can't undo it. I'll see you at dinner tonight. Uh, it's at 7:00. The youth group got pushed back an hour. Ma, do you want me to give him a call or... ? ( Door opens ) You're late. Sorry. Theresa's sister got engaged, so... There was a thing at O'Malley's. You were at a bar? Yes. She got engaged today, so... There was a thing. Okay. Let's eat. Bless us, o lord, for these, thy gifts, we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ our lord. Amen. All: Amen. All right, well, let's dig in. What are you waiting for? What is it? It looks great, ma. Thank you, Shannon. Yeah, I thought I'd try a new recipe. Vegetarian tamales. No meat? Ma, this is excellent. ( Mocking ) Ma, this is excellent. - ( Thudding sound ) - Ow! - Will you stop kicking me? - Will you stop being a jerk? Knock it off. You stop kicking him, - you stop being a jerk. - How am I a jerk? Well, what do you call leaving your wife and kids, and going to a bar with a girlfriend? Oh, boy, here it comes. Without Patty and the kids, we had to take a leaf out of the table. Your father almost strained his back. So okay, so now I'm responsible for dad's back. Be nice if you took responsibility for something. Eileen. I don't understand what he's doing. I'm just trying to be happy, mom. Well, who cares if you're happy? You need to do the right thing. Ma, why don't you tell us about the award? Oh, well. It's a great honor. - You deserve it. - Thank you, Shannon. See, not only is it just being nominated, but there is also a luncheon, and, um... And the prayer of absolution. Ma, I don't think you were the only one who thought that corn dog was a fish stick. ( Laughter ) I have other sins. Oh, I'll need all of you to write a personal statement, a letter of recommendation, for the monsignor. I don't know much about your church work. I think it's more sort of personal reference. Sure. We can do that for you. And also, they... They want to meet you, too. Why do they want to meet us? Well, just to see if, you know, everything's okay. What does that mean? Well, if everything is normal. Ma, what are you talking about? Well, that you are not married and over 30. Is that a new sin I'm not aware of? No, I just think it would be nice if you told the committee you were dating a good catholic man. Dad. So you want her to lie. Or you could start dating a good catholic man. I want her to try. Ma, it's never going to happen. Oh, if Fiona Doyle's obese daughter can get a man, well, so can you. Are you all right? I'm fine. ( Clears throat ) Maybe we should change the subject. No. I don't need a man. I have Angela. Well, honey, friends are nice, but at your age, you should start thinking about a family. We are family. Angela and I are together, and I'm five months' pregnant. - That's not funny. - ( Doorbell rings ) It's true, ma. I don't know what you're talking about. You know. You must know. I live with a woman. - I never date men. - ( Door opens ) - Hi. - Hi. Thanks. Uh, I don't want to know about this. What part, ma? What part don't you want to know anything about? Me? Your grandchild? You're talking crazy. Eileen. Great. All right then. I'm going to go. I'll pray for you. Pray for yourself. Come on. You know, I got married to frank in a thrift store gown borrowed from cousin rose. I always dreamed better for Shannon. She's a lawyer. I'd say your dreams came true. It was monsignor Murphy who made sure she got that scholarship. Every good thing my family has, the church has made possible, and now... Did Shannon tell you about those meetings, you know, for families of gay people? You sound like frank. Meetings can be helpful. Like the al-anon meeting where that woman went on about hiding money from her drunken husband - in her douche bag? - That was just one meeting. What kind of person does something like that? Eileen... What sort of woman hides money in a douche bag, - Eileen... - And then talks about it in public? It's not about the douche bag. I don't need meetings. There's nothing wrong with me. I just need my family to behave the way they're supposed to. ( Phone rings ) Hello. My daughter is Shannon cleary. Eileen. Shannon's in with the doctor, and frank is waiting around the corner in the waiting room. Who are you? Oh, I'm Christina, Angela's mom. - I'm Eileen's sister, Mary. - Come on. Frank is right this way. They're here. What happened? Shannon called me on the way to the hospital. - She called you. - Eileen. There was some blood. The doctor told Angela to meet her here. What did the doctor say? She hasn't come out yet. You must be Mrs. cleary. I'm Lou reyes, Angela's father. Nice to meet you. Maybe you should wait in the car. - Yeah. - Okay. You've gotta be kidding me. An insufficient cervix. ( Laughter ) And the doctor said it could also be referred to as an incompetent cervix. Oh, great! I'm already insufficient and incompetent, and the baby isn't even here yet. - ( Laughter ) - It isn't funny. ( Laughter stops ) Sorry, folks. Visiting hours are over. Oh, shoot. - Thanks, mom. - Thanks for coming. Take care. - Bye, dad. - Get some sleep, okay? I will. I'll try. - I'll bring the car around. - All right. - See you later, frank. - See ya. So I talked to the doctor. You have to take this seriously. I do. She doesn't want you going to the office. She wants you off your feet most of the day. You're gonna have to get someone to help. Eileen: I can help. We'll manage. I can clean and shop, cook... When Angela's at work. Ma... You need me. Shan, it would be a big help. You've never even been to my apartment. You hate highways. ( Horn honking ) Mrs. cleary. - Come in. - Thank you. Sorry, I'm running late for a meeting, or I'd give you the tour. Oh, no, I'm fine. You go ahead. Shannon should be off the phone soon. Right. We appreciate you being here. No, I gave Steve... Uh, I'm sorry. I gave Steve all the instructions. And they're happy with the contract as it is? Sorry, Robert. I didn't hear you. Well, can't they push it up? No, ma, leave those on the rack. No, if you hang pots, they just collect dust. Ma, I like but then, when you wanna use 'em, you have to wash 'em. Rob, let me call you back. Hand me the bread. I'll start breakfast. Oh, no, I had coffee. Decaf. Half a cup of decaf. Okay. Eggs. Okay. Why are you wearing a suit? Well, I'm working. From home, but I'm working. Were you going to make Shepherd's pie? I thought I would. Yeah, after I make you breakfast, I'm gonna fix something for lunch and dinner. Her friend Maria put a skull and crossbones on her arm. What does she think she is, a pirate? Oh, Mrs. cleary, there you are. - Good day, carmelita. - Good day, monsignor. Can I talk with you about the home visit next week? Oh, yes, of course. The archbishop is a go. We have confirmation from the pontifical council. - How exciting. - Yes, it is. It's put us all into a pressure cooker. The archdiocese wants to make sure our choice is beyond reproach. That's why it's so important the home visit goes well, to ensure you're our choice. Everyone should be there, frank, frank Jr., Shannon. The grandchildren. Well, Shannon isn't feeling very well. I don't know if she can make it. Oh, that could be tricky. Well, if she can't make it, be sure and explain why. Talk about her church duties, what her fianceé does. She's not officially engaged. What is it with young men these days? What are they waiting for, the second coming? - Hey, ma. - Yes. Dr. chen wanted me to ask you about your hysterectomy. Why? Well, she thinks it might be relevant to my condition. It's not. Well, you sure, because you were pretty young? She just wants to know if my condition is hereditary. I didn't have that short cervix thing. So what did you have? Shannon, some things are personal, and best left to prayer. What is this? That was a gift. Is there anything that you want to ask me? Hi. We're home. Oh, my, what did you get? It's from my sister in Miami, for the baby. It's a little early for that, isn't it? In my family, we celebrate Christmas in July. Oh, my god. My feet are killing me. This one schlepped me all over town looking for decorations for the wedding. Oh. Somebody's getting married? Angela and I are getting married next Sunday. Lou and I, we insist that they have a cer... A party, really, but being that the baby's coming and all that... We would love for you and frank to be there. I didn't mention it because i didn't think that you would come. Of course you'll come. Possibly. If it's after church. Open it. - Do you know what it is? - Uh-uh. I have no idea. ( All exclaiming ) Oh, my... That's beautiful. Are those diapers? It's so cheesy. It's cute, it's cute. We'll use it. The call to marriage is woven deeply into the human spirit. What makes a nun an expert on marriage? If you would like to hear bishop Reynolds' lecture on marriage and the complementarity of the sexes, here is all the information. I highly recommend it. It's about time I see our time is up. Oh, please remember, it is girl scout cookie season. Our parking lot will host several tables this weekend. Make sure you use the rear parking lot when you come to mass this Sunday. Mrs. cleary, does monsignor Murphy have your letters of recommendation? Not yet, but I'm sure he will soon. See that he does. Yes, sister. I have to go deliver meals to the homebound. Oh, I'm done with all that. Megan O'Donnell's mother's finally died, so she's got the time now. And giving her back her route really is the only Christian thing to do. Did you hear that my youngest, Peter's, been promoted to lieutenant? - Congratulations. - Thanks. And Michael was promoted to captain. Of course, frank Jr.'s a captain, isn't he? - No, he's a lieutenant. - Oh? Speaking of frank Jr., what is Patty's secret for keeping him so well-groomed? What do you mean? Well, my cousin owns the real estate office just right across the street from Theresa hennessey's salon. She said that she saw frank Jr. there nearly every day this week. And I can't even get Carl to trim his nose hairs, so what is her secret? I wouldn't know. Have a good day. Oh, sorry. All right, so have you, um... Picked a color yet? Okay. That's a nice color. What did you do, ma? We just talked. Oh, you just talked. She not only broke up with me, she decided to close the salon on Sundays. Theresa's not a catholic, is she? Is that what this is about, - that she's not catholic? - ( Turns vacuum off ) It's about, she's not your wife. All right, just stay out of my life, ma. You are ruining your life. You never even liked Patty. This is about you. I don't want you walking around with regrets. - They eat at your soul. - How do you not see that my whole life has been one long regret? One stupid night. You have to live with the choices you've made. I had one thing... And she meant something to me. I was just gonna do the same... Wear it the same way I wear it every day. - Oh, honey. - What? - I could do it for you. - I wanna look like myself. What are you doing here? Didn't you get my message? You nearly had a miscarriage. You have no business playing baseball. I'm just watching Angela's soccer game, ma. You should be in bed. The doctor said it's okay as long as I sit. Did you make me a fruitcake? You have to go home now. Well, I'm pretty sure if we play the game there, someone will knock the pans off the wall. This is not a joke. Ma, ma, calm down. I feel fine. Well, you shouldn't have walked here. Oh, Eileen, she didn't. I drove her. I was going stir crazy. We thought if she got out in the sun, it would be good for her. Well, I guess it's all right then. Ma, why don't you release the fruitcake and sit down? No, I can't stay. There's so much to do with the bishop's visit. - Oh! - Sorry. Ang, it's almost game time. Okay. Put it over here. Oh, honey, don't put it there. Ants. Over there. Here, put it on the chair. Have a good game. She's worried about you. * your mother loves you what are you doing here? Lookin' for you. Shannon said you went home, but I knew better. She should not be here. Ah, you're a doctor now? She could be hit in the stomach by a baseball. Yeah, that's unlikely in a soccer game. Well, no balls should be around her. Oh, you... you're sick. Let's, uh... Let's go for a walk. I'm watching Shannon. Okay, let's watch Shannon. We have to talk about this wedding. Why? I don't understand any of this. Maybe you don't have to. You think we should go, don't you? I do. It's probably at some woman's commune. Worse. It's at Christina's house. Oh, god. The cleary clan! Hey! I love what you're wearing. - Hi! - Hi. This is so beautiful. Eileen. You look fantastic. Oh... Frank, how about a hand, huh? You wanna eat? There's plenty of food in there. Welcome. Welcome, welcome. Father Joe, this is frank and Eileen cleary. Shannon's parents. Lovely to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. cleary. It's a privilege to be here. Thank you, father. Father Joe will be performing the ceremony. Woman: Christina! You'll notice that my full name isn't in the program. It's kind of a risk for me to be here. It's also an honor to participate in Angela and Shannon's holy union. Mrs. cleary, I wanted to actually give you my card, in case you ever feel like talking. Would either of you like something to drink? Frank's a drunk. Don't look at me. He asked to be left alone, I'm leaving him alone. ( Processional music begins ) Please be seated. This is an occasion of great joy. We gather to witness the exchanging of vows between Angela and Shannon. As I pray that god invokes his blessings on the couple, I invite each of you to quietly, and in your own way, also pray that god blesses Angela and Shannon and their intentions. In the presence of god, and loving friends, do you, Angela, take Shannon to be your spouse and your partner in life? I do. In the presence of god and loved ones and loving friends, do you, Shannon, take Angela to be your spouse and your partner in life? I do. May I see your rings? I declare these rings to be a symbol of your sacred vows. Shannon... I give you this ring as a symbol of my commitment to you. May it remind you always that you are surrounded ( voice echoing ) By my eternal love... And devotion. ( Shannon's voice echoing ) Angela... I give you this ring as a symbol of my commitment. May it remind you always that you are surrounded by my enduring love and devotion. Father Joe: You may now exchange a kiss as a sign of the sacred sacrament. Are you okay? No cuts. Come on. Let's go get you dried off. Here you go. - Thank you. - Oh, not a problem. It's all good. How do you accept this? Shannon is a lovely girl. It was really hard for me when Angie first told me. But that's normal. You should talk to father Joe. Oh, he was a big help for me. He's a catholic priest. Father Joe believes that we all do the best we can. What does that mean? Come join the party, get cleaned up, 'cause I can't wait to see you in my track suit. You look nice in that outfit. ( Huffs ) You know, they've taken quite a few cruises, and say they're a great vacation. - Who? - Christina and Lou. Ah! Bless, o lord, and sanctify the flesh of this bird. In Jesus Christ our lord. Amen. Amen. You know, on a big ship. Christina said the food is wonderful. They go to great places, and there's dancing every night. What are you talking about? A vacation. - A vacation? - Yeah. You know, like we used to. Vegas, Reno, Italy. We never went to Italy. I know that. But you always wanted to go, remember? Hmm? You wanted to see the David, visit Rome. All those beautiful churches. That was a long time ago. Yeah, but we could go, Eileen. I'm saying we could go. It would be good for us. It would've been good for us 20 years ago. I know. You wanna go on a vacation. Our family... Is falling apart... And you wanna take a cruise. You liked it before, Eileen, when I was drunk, running around? Our children shared nothing with us. Shannon is havin' a baby. This should be the best time in our lives. All right, frank. All right. Don't forget the circulars at the end of the driveway. Can't that wait until you get to the office? This isn't work stuff. This is us stuff. What is it? Well, she's gonna need a safe place to play, but I wanna keep the open feel. Oh, carpets. Play mats. Aww. I think it looks perfect. Yeah. Yesterday was a nice day. Yeah, for everyone except my mother. Why are you so hard on her? You didn't grow up with her. My mother threw me a party when I got my first period. She invited all the relatives, even the men. Mortified. I'd be happy with mortified. At least I'd know that she was invested in our lives. She's trying. ( Door opens ) Mrs. cleary, let me help you with that. Oh, no, I've got it. It's fine. Okay, I should get going. Well, Angela, I wanted to show you these freezer bags. You take a portion, and zip it closed, and then, just put it in the freezer. Okay. Yeah, like these. Wow. That's amazing. Well, that way, if I can't come by for some reason, you and Shannon will have plenty to eat. Well, thank you. That's great. It's convenient. It meant a lot to the both of us to have you at the wedding. Bye, baby. Bye. It's nice you're trying with Angela. Are you feeling okay? I'm good. Ma, I'm good. Today is the bishop's home visit, so I won't be back this afternoon. Do you want me to come? No. No, it's too far for you to travel. Frank and Patty and your aunt Mary will be there. The perfect family. Good luck, ma. Thank you, Shannon. Just stay calm. * you've been far away from me * * another land across the sea * * and all this time, my heart has been breakin' * * just waitin' round and achin' for * * a letter or a telegram * tellin' me how sweet I am * you swear your heart will never roam * * so till you come back home * I'll wear your colors, my dear * * till you're standin' right here * * next to the one who adores you * * whose heart is beating for you * * like a lighthouse guides a shipwrecked sailor... * would you take this junk and hide it? They'll be here in two hours. There's nothing wrong with being in a.A. I don't want the committee to know you're an alcoholic. Eileen, I drank for 25 years. There is no one in this town unaware that I'm an alcoholic. Are you crazy? * realize this love is strong * * as it has been all along * for miles and miles can't come between * * the kind of love we've seen * ( exhales loudly ) Oh, don't touch. Don't touch that. Where the hell is he? Patty will get him here. - ( Doorbell rings ) - Oh! Hi, mom. I'm home. - Frank! - ( Frank Jr. groaning ) Jesus, Mary and Joseph! What are you doin' drunk in the middle of the afternoon? Who cares what time he drinks? The bishop is gonna be here. What, they're not here yet? Bishop! Frank, what are we gonna do? - Uh... bring him to the den. - I am here oh, bishop! ( Laughs ) - Put a sock in his mouth. - Okay. Is my lezzie preggy sister here? On your feet. One of the guys at the firehouse told me those babies are called Turkey-baster babies. - What? - ( All talking at once ) - ( Doorbell rings ) - Oh, my god! - They're here. - ( All exclaiming ) - Turkey-baster babies. - Yeah, it's funny. - ( Laughing ) Turkey baster... - Yeah, yeah. - Whoa, whoa. - Gay-bies! Hey, when did you get here? Oh, god! Frank Jr. followed in his father's footsteps. Both hero firemen. Thank you, monsignor. Frank got a medal of valor for saving an entire family in an apartment fire. Mm, by the favor of the heavens. We should do good deeds for the glory of god, not to get medals. He didn't save those people to get medals, sister. It was his job. Uh, would you like to see some family pictures? Oh, yes. This is frank Jr.'s wedding picture. ( Thudding sound, frank Jr. groaning ) What was that? The, uh... the plumbing. Isn't it lovely, your eminence? Yes. Is this your daughter? No. That's our son and his wife. Where's your daughter's wedding picture? There's no husband. No, but she's dating a very nice young man, and we expect to hear that they'll be married soon. Would you excuse me a moment? Well, what's the young man's name? Your eminence? The young man's name. What young man would that be? The young man your daughter is about to marry. They're not officially engaged. Regardless, he has a name, doesn't he? - Angelo. - Antonio. Angelo Antonio. He's one of those people who has a first name for a last name. Like my friend. She had the maiden name Riley, and she had a brother, John. Well, her daughter married a man with the surname John. So she named her daughter Riley. So she had a brother, John Riley, and a granddaughter, Riley John. ( Weak chuckling ) Oh! I think that went well. Bishop Donnelly is a good man. He seemed to focus on the positive. What was positive? My work for the church. Our beautiful home. What are you doing? Where are you going? Do you remember when Shannon was a baby, how people used to stop us in the street? She had those blonde curls, big, blue eyes. Why are you talking about this? It's always the same word. She's... she's perfect. Not cute, not adorable. She's perfect. Frank? I can't live like this anymore. Like what? Well... We could start with the lying. Oh. What am I supposed to say? My daughter is a lesbian, and is having a Turkey-baster baby? I'm not just talking about today, Eileen. Oh, I don't think you want to talk about the past, frank. I'm sober now. Things could be very different for us, but no. See, you're stuck. Stuck in the way it was. Oh, let me tell you about the way it was, frank. I put up with your crap for 20 years. I held this family together on my own, and I never once considered leaving you. Maybe you should have. * there was a house halfway around the world * * and I was invited in for a small taste of gin * yes, could I... Please speak with, uh, father Joe MacDonald? * cage too small uh, yes. * I asked the caretaker 'cause he was the maker * * looked at me and laughed * took another sip from his glass * * he said, open up your ears and heart * * you put a big bird in a small cage * * and it'll sing you a song * that we all love to sing along * Mrs. cleary? * to the sound of the bird that mourns * * put a big bird in a small cage * * and it'll sing you a song * you put a big bird in a small cage * * and it will sing you a song * before we discuss our luncheon, Agnes Dunn would like to update us on the petition drive to stop gay adoption. Who's adopting gay people? No one is, Greta. It's the gays that are trying to indoctrinate our children. Nun: Mm, yes. The law currently states that gays can adopt children. But we are working with the catholic league of religious and civil rights to gather signatures to put a "protect our children" initiative on November's ballot. Is this really where we should be focusing our energy? Well, we know where you stand, miss "i have a gay big brother." Yes, I have a gay brother and I am going to start the petition, and once we all have signed it, we will then circulate it among the congregation. Well, then, let us move on to our catholic woman of the year luncheon. As you all know, both Agnes Dunn and Eileen cleary have been nominated. However, there's only one honored, and to receive sacramental absolution from the sacred heart of Jesus. To quote Matthew 22:14, "many are called, but few are chosen." Wonderful. Wonderful. - Oh, what are you doing? - Ma, it's okay. You can't handle anything toxic. It's a green product. It's non-toxic. Why didn't you tell me daddy left home? We had a little fight. He'll be home soon. But he's never left you before. Shannon, everything is all right. - Ma. - Nothing is wrong. You're working too hard. We've gotta pay for the baby, ma. This baby is yours. No one can take it away from you. What are you talking about? Just that I'm glad you're having the baby. It's yours. No one can dispute that. No, this baby is mine and Angela's. We planned it together. Well, I know that, but some people don't understand. Some people. Who doesn't understand, ma? Some people at the church have started a petition against gay adoption. Okay. Most people think that a baby needs a mother and a father. Just because you've chosen an alternative lifestyle doesn't mean people accept it. I don't care what those people think. I signed it. You signed the petition? How could you do that? What if I don't agree with your lifestyle? You just assume I'll accept it. - What about accepting me? - I don't petition against you. That was Agnes Dunn's idea, not mine. But you signed it. You signed it. What is it about my life that you find so reprehensible? - You're living in sin. - Says who? The pope. Well, what do you think? I don't have to think. I'm a catholic. I don't know why I'm still surprised by you. I raised you in the church. Why don't you understand? I do. Damn it. I do. That's why you have to leave. I don't want my baby around you. * look out the window * it's all horizons and halos * * holding a moment * healing the scars so they don't show * * someone say something to crush all the noise * * that surrounds us * if I catch a bullet *then maybe we can make it through this * - oh... - Ah, Mrs. cleary. Thank you so much for meeting me here. - I'll see you next week. - Oh, thank you. Sorry for not introducing you. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions. Oh, I understand. Can I get you anything? No. Why don't you hold these meetings in your own church? Oh, I don't lead these meetings. I attend them. There was a sense of urgency in your message. I asked my sponsor if I could use the room to meet with you. Glad you called. I just meant because you didn't show up the last time. I'm sorry, father. Uh, let's have a seat. So, how can I help you? I've made a lot of mistakes. We all struggle from time to time. What if it's all the time? I think you're being a little hard on yourself. No. I'm not. Why don't you tell me why you're here today? I've been nominated for catholic woman of the year. The archbishop of Dublin is flying over to sanctify the winner with a prayer of absolution. That's a great honor. I want it so badly. I sacrificed my family for it. You think the church wouldn't approve of them. Do you? Mrs. cleary, I think that, uh... God sits at the head of your family, and the only real obligation you have is just to be one unit, united in love. I've been going to church my whole life, and I've never heard anybody like you. ( Door opens ) - Frank. - Dad asked me to wait for you. Shannon was rushed to the hospital. ( Monitor beeping ) Shannon. * I've been finding puzzle pces of us * * kept in the dust * I've been hiding letters and photograph frames * * to forget your name * we were never meant to be this damn broken * * words were never meant to be this half-spoken * Eileen, you left the front door wide open. * ...The space between the universe * I brought in your mail. * and all we see has gone away * * gone away I'm so sorry, Eileen. We're gonna take a walk. Shannon's in the bedroom. Okay. Shannon. I'm so sorry. They let me hold her. It was so quiet, except for Angela crying. Even a moment can be a gift. Is that a god's will thing? We don't know his reasons. Really, ma. You don't think he's punishing me for having this child with another woman? Shannon, you are going to be a wonderful mother. It just wasn't in god's plan right now. That's your answer for everything. Sometimes, these things just happen. To me. It happened to me. Nothing I'm going through could you possibly understand. I do. No, you never had to imagine what you could've had. You never had to imagine what her first smile, her first steps, her first word would've been. I have. I had an abortion. I don't understand. I thought your father was leaving us. So all these years of spewing all this crap, of putting all this morality on dad, on frank, on me. It's not that simple. How could you have an abortion? I never worked. I married your father in high school. I didn't even know how to drive. Your father came home, and told me he was in love. I had two small children. What was I supposed to do? I didn't want another child. I couldn't have another baby alone. I wasn't alone. I just didn't know that. You just lacked faith. So that's what I need to do, right, mom? Turn to god, and it will be all right. I don't know. I don't know anymore. Turn to me. You're quiet today. Am I? You excited about the award? Mrs. punch, I haven't won it yet. Well, you believe you deserve it, don't you? Mrs. punch. I think you deserve it. Why? Because you show up, every day like clockwork. You're one to be counted on, Mrs. cleary. That's not an unremarkable thing. Ah, Mrs. cleary. Always our most faithful. I don't wish to disturb your prayer, but I wanted to know when I'd be getting your family's letters. I'm sure they'll be arriving soon. The bishop was disappointed the children were not able to make the in-home visit. The letters will be most helpful. Yes, monsignor. And you should know that he was most impressed with your record of service. And I assured him that your family is a model of honest, faithful catholic values. I'll leave you to your prayer. Dear monsignor Murphy and members of the committee: I have been giving a lot of thought to what it means to win the award, to be recognized by the church, and, of course, to be absolved of my sins. I realize now that, in order to be truly forgiven, we must first come to terms with our choices, no matter how difficult that might be. My efforts to repair things begins now. Before you make your decision, there's some things I'd like you to know about my family. Thanks for bringing me my watch. Mmm. How's frank Jr. doing? Working a lot of overtime. Frank, what happened to us? You married an alcoholic. I had an abortion. - It was when you were seeing - I know. You know? You were hemorrhaging. It was pretty bad. The only way they could stop the bleeding was with a hysterectomy. The doctors didn't wanna do it without your husband's consent. It took Mary six hours to find me. You almost bled to death. That night was the first time i tried to get sober. Oh, frank. It took me 15 years to forgive myself. Can you forgive me? I never blamed you. Uh-uh. No. I got a meeting to go to. Can I go with you sometime? ( Sighs ) It's not really... Sure. Well, this is highly unusual. I have glowing recommendations from frank and the children. Yes, but you also have a letter written by Mrs. cleary herself. I think the immodesty of the family confessions in her letter is refreshing. * somehow * I'm leading someone else's life * * I cut her star down * with my knife * and right now * I still see the way the moon * * plays this tune * though our lights died * my hands shake * my knees quake * it's every day * the same way * 'cause then came you Mrs. cleary. What are you doing here? Well, I just thought I'd get an early start, you know, on account of the luncheon. Don't you remember? You arranged with Mrs. O'Donnell to deliver your meals today, on account of the luncheon. Oh, I'm... I'm glad you're here. Come here. I'm rooting for you, Mrs. cleary. I am preparing a special meal for the occasion. Pollo con crema, my mother's recipe. I prepared it this weekend for my family, just so I wouldn't be so rusty. Oh, you have a beautiful family. Thank you. I'm looking forward to meeting your family today. Aah! ( People talking quietly ) You hardly said a word to him. - Who? - The archbishop. Agnes Dunn's been circling them all morning like a shark. Can we all take our seats, please? They're not coming. What are you talking about? Try to enjoy yourself. Welcome to a very special commemoration of what it means to be a catholic woman. We are exalted by the presence of the archbishop of Dublin. ( Applause ) This year, we are particularly blessed to be honoring someone who continually commits herself to all manner of pastoral good works in our community. But community service alone would not be enough. We are lucky to have in our parish a woman who embodies both faith and family. She has been part of our community for many years, and in some ways, is our community. Her dedication and devotion mirrors... What are we doing here? You're being honored. Who cares? Eileen? * * * * * * *
