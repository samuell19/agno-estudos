You should've come earlier, Mr. John. Too bad. This looks just like my mom and me, when she was pregnant with my sister. - Who bought this? - Somebody. It was that scar-faced Phillip, wasn't it? Give it to me. I'll pay you double. Come here. You'll like this one better. This is the little you, Mr. John. I was fat as a kid. Big belly. But this woman looks like my mom when she was pregnant with me. And this is my older brother. See? It's perfect. But that guy is an asshole. My mom died because he was a naughty boy. But look at the way this woman looks at her belly. She knows the body beside her is trouble. But the boy inside her will make her the happiest mother in the world one day. If it hadn't come from a woman as beautiful and smart as you, I would have regarded it as bullshit. You know I'm right, Mr. John. Gambir, if you meet a woman like your wife again, let me know. I will thank you and love you like I love my $3,000,000 mansion. I'll take this. Brother Jimmy, Mr. John will take this one. You won't regret it, Mr. John. You know what? I think if Gambir hadn't made sculptures of pregnant women, he wouldn't be as successful now. It's amazing how much more you can gain with a little extra material. Lucky bastard. We've known him since junior high, and his star always shines. I think we have to admit, the guy's a genius. It wouldn't be enough for him to have a wife like Talyda, would it? Can you go away so we can talk about you behind your back? You can say anything to my face. Your head's too big already. Rio, Dandung, your friend here is really something. - Big bucks tonight, huh, Brother Jimmy? - Money's the only thing on your mind, huh? Did you see how people reacted tonight? Everybody said the sculptures look alive. Talyda, your husband is a genius. I know, Jimmy. This pig year belongs to you, Gambir. Al right. I'm gonna go to the loo. I don't think body casting can be categorized as art. What's body casting? The sculptor just has to stick the raw material to a model's body. Is body casting not art? Is masturbation not sex? And so what are you saying? Gambir uses body casting? Who's the model? His wife can't get pregnant. It doesn't have to be his wife. My point is, body casting is too easy to be called an art. Well, I think every artist can create art with every available tool. It's the originality that counts. Originality? Look around you. In my opinion, they are original. Don't be pretentious. Hi! - Congratulations! - Thank you. Welcome! Everybody is celebrating your success in there, and you're out here by yourself? No regret, Gambir. You're giving meaning to those babies. I'm not like Mr. John whom you can fool. It's all bullshit, and you know it. Bullshit? Which part? I'm disgusted... at myself. Gambir, listen. Do you think I'm cruel? Disgusting? What kind of person do you think I am? Please answer me, Gambir. Do you think I would let you do something appalling? Disgusting? Cruel? I love you, Gambir. Gambir, I love you. I love you, Talyda. The key is discipline. For a child, loving them is just not enough. Do you want to know what kind of person your husband would be? If I had not taught him discipline? He wouldn't be this successful, that's for sure. And for sure, he wouldn't have got a wife like you. We're both the same. We want the best man. The most self-motivated. That's why when you have a kid, which I'm sure you will pretty soon, you'll have to teach him about discipline. Aren't you two tired of gossiping about me every time mom's here? Would you prefer us fighting like other in-laws? Will you still cook me breakfast? I've found the best doctor for erectile dysfunction. His name is Dr. Roni Anggono. He has a clinic in the south. I'll give you the address. Gambir, I am your mother. So what if Talyda tells me? What's important is that we have to find the solution. Let me. Who is it, darling? Nobody. Must be some kids playing with the bell again. HELP ME My late father used to say, your attitude in sports is your attitude in life. And? I think he was right. In sports, I always give my opponents a chance to win. But no matter how hard I try to lose, I always end up winning. Sooner or later, we got to find a game where you can defeat me. I'm not playing to win. What for, then? It's not the only objective. But if you keep losing, you'll bore your sparring partner to death! Not having a sparring partner as ambitious as you can lower your blood pressure. I got high blood pressure from having an easy sparring partner like him. What pissed me off more is that he's got more luck than me. You're pissed off because you consider everything as a competition. But he's right. You can win if you want. Maybe there's some other way, darling. Gambir, it's true I don't have any emotional connection with my parents. But, I don't want them to know that their daughter is having a child out of wedlock. Talyda, we can get married next week if you want. Yeah, and when the guests start talking about my belly, I can kiss my job goodbye. It's not just that I work for my father. I do really love my job. We don't have to have a wedding reception. There's a word for people like you. Simpleton. But I do love you. And I need you to trust me on this one. Does it still hurt? I'll give you some pills. Take one every time it hurts, OK? She's so strong. Pardon? Your girlfriend. She's so strong. The first time me and my wife came here, she was screaming like crazy. Or, you've done this often? Never before. First timer. After coming here the first time, my wife and I couldn't sleep for a week. The first time felt like murder. The second time, we still felt guilty. But after that, it became routine. Like dinner in a restaurant. Who had the idea to come here? Let me guess. She said she would be ashamed to have the child. It really shouldn't be an excuse for an abortion. So, what was your excuse if not shame? We had nothing to be ashamed of. My wife and I were already married when we first came here. We just didn't want to have children. What's the point? We believe those children don't want to be born. This world offers nothing but trouble to them. Your wife, where is she? Oh, she died when we aborted our seventh child. But she still comes here often, you know. Many nurses have seen her. She's not ashamed. She just doesn't want to have your child. She's your enemy. Honey... What good that was left in me has gone, along with this baby. Talyda, we have to go through this together. I'm alone, Gambir. And so are you. Sit down. Are you all right? Get some rest here. I'll be back. Do you think Arjasa will fit into this sculpture's belly? Who? Arjasa. Our baby. I can't live without him. He shouldn't go anywhere. He has to stay here. Talyda, what are you talking about? Darling, listen. Everything's gonna be fine. We've made a mistake. But Arjasa is innocent. - Talyda, what is this? - I'm fine. I'm OK. Yes, I am. Please? Baby, I know what you've just been through, but... - What are you talking about? - Please do this one for me. - Please, baby. OK? Please. - Talyda... Please. My God. I love it. Let me put it in my gallery. It's not for sale. Why? It's for Talyda. But Gambir can make you another one like this. Will it be as good as this? Sure. Gambir has found a great technique. Did you realize what you said? Huh? I now pronounce Gambir and Talyda husband and wife. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. Come here. This is a gift from Dad, but I designed it myself. Come. Wake up! Are you coming in, Mr. Gambir? We have your order ready. You got to stand up for yourself, you coward. You must. Talyda? Help me... Who is this? Goddamn kids! Oh, you're still awake, dear? You have to congratulate your pretty wife. Remember the big tobacco campaign account? I got it! Congratulations. A bit less enthusiastic than I expected, but that's OK, dear. I won't make sculptures of pregnant women again. Whatever. What do you want from me? Huh? I didn't say anything. Bullshit! You're so smart. You always get me to do what you want. I want you to have more drive. To believe more in yourself. I know you can do that. If not, I wouldn't be married to you. Really? What if I'm not that guy? I might be wrong. The more I think of it, I think I am wrong. You're just a weak man. Everything about you... is weak. - I'll show you! - Gambir! - Gambir! - Don't move! You're crazy! Please stop! Talyda! I deserve this. It's all my fault. No, it's my fault. No, it's my fault. I love you, Gambir. I love you more, Talyda. From now on... I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do. Everything means nothing if I have to lose you. I'll die if you don't love me anymore. I love you. I love you very much. PRESS PUSPARANTI JOURNALIST I've checked my schedule. You can have another exhibition in two months. Two months is fine. But I won't make sculptures of pregnant women anymore. Are you out of your mind? I have to prove I can do something else. If not, it means I'm stuck. Oh, what a clich√©. Just like every other artist out there. Arrogant! When an artist is on top of his game, then he pretends to change direction. - Do you know what the usual outcome is? - What? Disaster, my son. Always ends in disaster. You'll do a normal exhibition in two months. Period. - Wow. Why are you so pushy? - I've promised so many people! That's your problem, isn't it? Gambir. Listen. The first time you made me a sculpture of a pregnant woman, I didn't tell you who paid for it, right? I paid for it. Me. That sculpture fell down and broke into pieces. Do you know what I found? That's right, Gambir. I found something... with a smell that made me not able to eat for weeks! You've worked for such a long time. It's impossible that your wife didn't know. If somebody hears about this, you and your wife will be gone for a long time. You know where, don't you? To jail, Gambir. Gambir. Please don't open that door. What is this? It's just a room. Why did you never tell me there was another room here? Because I thought you didn't need to know. I didn't need to know? This is my house, too, Talyda. I live here. Whatever is behind that door, I want nobody to know but myself. What? I know you've asked me to do weird things, but this is outrageous! What's in it? Just some memories I would like to forget. If you open that door... You won't be able to imagine how devastated I will be... if that door doesn't stay closed. What happened? Did something bad happen to you? Even if it did... It means nothing now. Because I have you. You just have to trust me. There's nothing that I hide... or do... that will bring harm to us. Please, Gambir. Just trust me. I love you, Gambir. - I love you more, Talyda. Please don't ever open that door. Yeah. Wait, a bit to the left. No, no, that's too much. Oh, c'mon. Everybody's got secrets. Friends, wives. - I don't keep any secrets from you. - Ah, that's bullshit. You must. And I don't want to hear about them. When you decide not to tell me something, you might think that it would upset me. So, you're keeping secrets from me? Of course. What? Did you sleep with my wife or something? That's not funny. So, what is it? I can't imagine anything about you that I wouldn't like. Even if I slept with your wife? That's not funny. No, listen. This is serious. I think the relationship between a husband and a wife, or between two best friends, is close to the relationship between men and God. Sometimes you just have to believe without asking any questions. They call it faith. Ah;, bullshit. Thanks. LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT HELP ME What's wrong? Can you see that writing? Yeah? Why? Thank God. I'm not crazy then. Why do you say that? I've been getting that message for a month. How do you know it's for you? Read this. It's supposed to say, "Don't be too self-centered." Look at this. THE ONLY THING CERTAIN IN THIS WORLD IS COINCIDENCES Not everything is about you, Gambir. Yes! That's it! That's how you play the game! I've never felt this good after being beaten. He's the man! - Don't be happy just yet, bitch. You won't be happy after I beat your ass. HELP ME Hey! Hey! - Who put this in my bag? - Put what? This thing! Nobody's here except us. What's wrong? Gambir! Gambir. Gambir! Gambir... Gambir! Gambir. Why do you never shut that door? Where the hell is he? If he's starving again, don't blame me. Come here! Come here! You sit down! What is it? You don't like my cooking? Oh, God. I can't take this anymore. Eat! Open your mouth! Open! Come on, throw it up if you dare. Throw it up! Goddamn ungrateful boy! You're trying to give me a heart attack, aren't you? You want me dead, don't you? Ungrateful child! Come here! What do you want! Oh God! HELP ME HELP ME Excuse me. Where do you think you're going? What is this place? Sorry, only members are allowed to be here. How do you become a member? If you still have to ask how, it means you can't be a member here. I want to speak with your boss. I'm sorry, but you have to go. Tell me, what is this place? Security! How can someone just come in like that, you idiot? Please. Get your hands off me. Do you kidnap children in there? Loser. What did you say? Hey, I could buy you if I wanted to! Sir, what is this place? I'm sorry, sir. But I have to know. Get lost. Dandung! Dandung? Hey, man. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. Sorry? Where have you been? Oh, I was meeting someone at that cafe over there. What is Herosase? Huh? Herosase. You've just been there. I don't know what you're talking about. I saw you entering Herosase. What is that place? What's wrong with you? Listen. Even if I tell you what it is, you won't be able to take it. Well, try me! You are a weak man, Gambir. This is how you're supposed to be, my friend. But it's too late. The whole city has been stepping all over you. Tell me what it is! You really want to know, huh? Big shot? Back so soon, Mr. Dandung? - Is Mrs. Mona still in? - She's upstairs. I'm bringing a new member. Welcome to the club, sir. Welcome. Make yourself at home. So, you're here to find an answer? What is this place? There's only one rule here. No questions asked. The membership fee will be billed to your credit card under Herosase Inc. You can call our office for cancellation at any time. And we have every right to revoke your membership if you violate the rule. No. Questions. Asked. How do I find an answer if I'm not allowed to ask any questions? You're an artist, Gambir. Use your imagination. How do you know that I'm a...? CONTRACT Father... Help me. What did I say? Come here! You... Mrs. Mona has gone home. Who else is in charge here? Only Mrs. Mona. I want to know about... I don't know anything. I'm just a receptionist. How was it? What the hell is that place? You know the rule. I never asked any questions, as long as I can come in and see those things. Have you seen the old lady who always stitches her own hand? Oh, you must see... You're all fucking sick! I'm just a spectator. How did you become a member there? A friend of mine brought me. You can only be a member if somebody brings you in. How do they get that footage? How the fuck should I know? What I know is, they installed hidden cameras in many houses. I have to tell the police. You think they can plant hidden cameras at people's houses without strong backing? Cops. There's a kid being tortured there. We can't just ignore him! What you saw has got nothing to do with you. They don't know you, and you don't know them. - He asks for my help! - That's rubbish! Just because they look at the camera doesn't mean they talk to you! I must do something. All you can do is just be cool about it, so they won't revoke your membership. And pray that one day that kid will tell you where he lives. Here's your tea. - Excuse me. I need to go to the toilet. - OK. This is much more important than some celebrity's profile. He must have been abused by his parents since he was born. I'm surprised that he's still alive. Yeah, I know. There's too many child abuse cases. But this one is really horrible. I have to write about him. It's the least I can do to help. I'm going to try to visit him now. Did you see a woman go through here? No. Did you see a woman go through here? Yes, just now. She was on the phone. Good morning. Didn't I tell you, you have to wake up early, even on Sundays? Let's get up, you lazy bones. What is this? I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to. How many times do I have to tell you not to wet the bed? How many times? Come here! How many times? Always making me angry! Don't do that! You're not getting better, you're always like this! Dad! Baby, what's wrong? Hey, what happened? Baby. Baby? Hey, what happened? Hey, what happened? HELP ME He must live near here... He must live near here! Gambir? Gambir! Hold on! Where are you going? Gambir! Dandung! Help! - Where are you going? - Gambir? Dandung! - Hey, Gambir? - Gambir? - Gambir! - Shut up! - Hey, Gambir. Talyda, please. - What's wrong? - Gambir... - He must live near here! - Gambir listen to me. - He must live near here! - Talyda, go inside. I'll handle this. - What's wrong, Gambir? Gambir! What you're looking for is not here. Gambir, listen to me. I just got the news that the kid is dead. His mom killed him. Accidentally. He's dead. Liar! You fucking liar! You fucking liar! I'm a bad person, but I would never lie to you. I'm here to tell you about it. Look. I'm so sorry that I brought you to that place. What really happened? Yeah, what happened? He saw something he wasn't supposed to see. What? He didn't say. What? How do I know? He's an artist, right? Don't artists sometimes behave like that? Look, I was the one who cooled him down last night. You two should thank me. Ah, hi, Talyda! Hi, Mr. John! I'm so happy tonight. I got the sculpture I wanted. What time did you arrive here? Very early. I even helped with the decoration. The name is Anggita. I paid Jimmy in full. It's mine now. I swear to God, that guy must have robbed me! But that's OK. It's worth the price. It's near Christmas. Rather than putting up a Christmas tree, it's better to put up the sculpture. Save the pine trees. Do people think this is America or what? There are many pine trees there, but not here. People who come tonight will only be pissed off. Everything is sold out. But I don't want Gambir to work right away after this. I want him to get some rest, so they can have a baby. So, tell me what else I can do to help. I heard they have good medicine in China to cure impotency. Maybe you can get me that. That's easy. I'll ask my relatives over there to look for it immediately. What makes some people born with talent, and some not? Let me ask you something. When you see all those sculptures, can you understand what makes them good? Nope. So, you don't miss anything then. Because you aren't able to understand it. Yeah, but I want to know what the fuss is all about. The only art I can appreciate is the decorations on the plates in restaurants. But that makes me not have the heart to eat it. See? If you ask me, I'm pretty content with my life. I'm not sure if I'd be happier if I had more talent. Look at Gambir. Do you want to live like him? Where is he anyway? Somewhere I guess. HELP ME I'm sorry I failed. How did you get this bad report card? Huh? You want to kill me? You are a dog! Come here. Come! Come here! You ungrateful child! Ungrateful child! Just drop dead! I love you, Mommy. I'm so sorry. I'm so cold. Shut up! I'm gonna kill you. Gambir? Gambir. I wish you were my own son. Can you see how everybody tonight is so delighted to see your work? But I've told Jimmy to give you time for a holiday with Talyda. So you two can spend some time to make a baby. Gambir. Rio's just gotten enlightenment. He no longer envies you. You know what? I think there's a reason why we're so different. We have to be around Gambir if, for instance, someone bullies him. And if not for Gambir, we wouldn't be in this kind of place tonight. - Cheers for Gambir. - Cheers! And now that we're one big family, we have to take care of each other. I'm going to the loo. I'm not sure that those people aren't aware that there are cameras planted in their houses. I bet they're paid. Is it really that interesting? Like a mirror, honey. No matter how bad it is, it always tells the truth. But honestly, when it comes to that abused child, I just can't take it. Today, I accidentally stumbled on that channel. I am sure he'll be dead soon. Hey! Watch it! I have to use the room. Mr. Gambir, all rooms are already booked for these gentlemen. This is very important. I'm sorry, but you'll have to come back tomorrow. This is about life and death. I'm not looking for entertainment like those men or any of your other members. I'm sure there's still good in you, even though you work at this kind of place. And it's to the goodness that's still in you that I am appealing now. Please let me use a room. Please. Where are you? Tell me where you are, so I can help you. No! Please no! What if Gambir finds out? Don't worry about him. This is for his sake, too. Having children is crucial to a marriage. All right, so where should I meet Rio? Possum Hotel. Room number 333. You also have to try Dandung. He's an ex-athlete. If you sleep with him, I'm sure you'll get pregnant right away. What should we do so he'll keep making those sculptures? Leave it to me. Easy. As long as you can play along. Gambir, where are you, dumb-ass? I went out to get some fresh air. Well, get some fresh air, and then come back here. This is your event. I just want to invite you all to Christmas dinner. What? You can do that tomorrow. I just want to make sure you'll all come. OK, I'll make sure we're all coming. But you've got to come back here now. Al right. He's inviting us to Christmas dinner tomorrow. - Hey, Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Hey, they opened the presents already? - Let's just go in. I'm starving. - Come eat first. Hi! I'm so happy you guys could make it. We never got together for a Christmas dinner like this. This night will be very special. We got you a present. What's this? Just open it. It was between this or the one with a tiger drawing on it. I thought you'd like the elephant trunk one more. This is cool. Let's go. What are you waiting for, darling? - Hi. - We're here already. I didn't see your car. We parked at the back. Oh, you two come together? That's nice. Yeah, it was my idea. Great. Everybody is here. Let's have dinner. Where are you going, honey? I'm gonna get the wine. What are you doing? I'm helping you. - Who else are you gonna go with? - That's right. He's all alone. I just want to say that I feel very blessed tonight. Because I can be with you all, my best friends, family, and of course, my perfect wife. And I want to thank you all, for all this time, for making my life more meaningful. It's called "devilish spit." A poison that will paralyze you for about ten minutes. You won't be able to move. But you can still see and hear me. Now. Listen. I just realized that all my life, I've never been truly alive. Everybody tells me what to do. People decide things for me. I am aware... that to live fully... I have to cut all the strings attached to me. Mr. Jimmy. I respect you like my own father. But you are just another businessman who's willing to do anything for money. Dandung. You must have realized that all this time, you're more than a friend to me, I took you as my own brother. You know what? If you had told me that you wanted to fuck my wife, I would have given you permission. In your dreams. Rio. Now look. Who's weak now? Who's the brave one? Mom. Mom... Mom, do you know what? No child wants to be born. Every child is brought to this world simply because their parents fuck each other. But some parents should be forgiven, because they give their children love. Not just pain and heartbreak. Don't worry. I won't make you messy like these guys. Because unlike you... I can still respect people. Now what? What should I do to you? You know what? Even though you have hurt me so bad... I think I still love you. But, I still have to kill you. Because if not, all this will mean nothing. You know why? Because you're the big bang. You're the main event. And for that, we've got to have something special. I have this for you. We will play Russian Roulette. The players are you and you. I don't want to die, Talyda. You guys have taken my life. Now, I want to live free. If you make it out alive from three bullets... I'm gonna let you live. Look at them. They are all dead. You don't want to be like them, right? How about it? It's a good offer, don't you think? Do you like it? Yes, you like it. Good. Let's begin. One. Two. Three. Let's try again. One. Two. Three. I can't hear you. Speak up. Don't worry. You're the luckiest woman in the world. You'll live through this. The third. If... you... kill... me... you will... never know... what's behind that... door... - You... - If I kill you I'll never know. Hmm... You're right. But like I said... You are... one lucky woman. You failed again, Gambir. - You failed... - You failed to save us. Gambir? Gambir. Gambir... Gambir! Gambir. How dare you hide when I call you, you spoiled brat. Gambir. BRAIN AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Gambir. Gambir? Gambir! PRESS PUSPARANTI JOURNALIST Gambir. Gambir? He won't be able to hear you. Can you please give these books and magazines to him? - OK, I'll bring them in. - Thanks. What's inside his head? I've been here years looking after him. I still don't know. Will he ever get out? I'm not a psychiatrist. But if someone could kill their parents when they were eight years old, who knows what they could do as an adult? It wasn't his fault. He was only a child. I wouldn't worry too much if I were you. What do you mean? Like I said... who knows what's inside his head? Maybe he knows something that we don't. All right. I have to leave now. - I'll see you soon. - Right. I've sinned, Father. My child, what have you done? I just killed my wife. Will I go to Hell, Father? There is no Hell. Father, Hell must exist. If there's no Hell, then there's no Heaven. Go home. You can see your wife alive again if you want. That's impossible, Father. Do you want her alive again? Actually... I'm glad that she's dead. Then go home. Just like that? I just have to go on like nothing happened? Yes. But... if somebody you really fear forbids you from opening one door, then never open that door. What door? The forbidden door. Everybody has one. How do I know which one it is? You'll only know after you open it. Now, go home. Yes, I have finished the article. I got all the materials I need. OK, I'm on my way to the office now. HELP ME
