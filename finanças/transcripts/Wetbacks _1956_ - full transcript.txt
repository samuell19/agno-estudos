[MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on. Come on. Why the devil did you bring him out here? -Our friend is gettin' ideas. -How many you got out there? -30, and let's get 'em outta here. [SIREN] COAST GUARD [VOICEOVER]: Stay where you are. This is the United States Coast Guard. You are under arrest. You are under arrest. Avoid the fishing boat. Hold your position. Do not board the fishing boat. Stay where you are. Do not board the fishing boat. [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -What happened to Stevenson? -Sick leave-- overworked. -That figures-- big responsibility, small pay, constant tension-- par for the course when you're working for the government. -Yeah. -Sherman wants everybody to know he is the new boss here. -Eager beaver. -He won't last long either. -Yeah, very eager. -Hi, gentleman. You know Ray Dixon of my staff-- of the highway patrol and of the United States Coast Guard. -Gentlemen. -How are ya? -That was nasty on the beach last night. I understand you picked up all the Mexicans. -And Captain Parker. -No trace of the truck-- probably a high-powered souped-up job. -I wouldn't doubt it-- running wetbacks across the border is a big business these days. -Big business? -How much can those poor Mexicans pay? A couple of dollars a head? -Sometimes, yes. Sometimes the family's life savings. There's plenty of work on the big ranches out here picking cotton and lettuce. -But how much can these smugglers take in? -Four, five thousand a week. --[WHISTLES] Looks like we're in the wrong business inspector. -Oh, they've really made it a big business. They hire the Mexicans out to the ranchers as farm labor-- truck them from one farm to another. -Yeah, but how much can they net after they pay off of Mexicans? -They don't pay off. They keep the money and run out on 'em. -I suppose you've checked the ranchers. -A few. They appear to be in order. Gentlemen, they can bring the wetbacks across the border from Texas clear out there to 10 miles in the Pacific. And they can cross by land, by air, and by water-- maybe even underground for all we know. Now, headquarters for this racket could be right here in El Paso, Juarez, Nogales, Yuma, Mexicali, or right here in San Diego. For a complete check we'd need a couple of thousand more men. Put that in your budget and see what happens. -Looks like you've got an impossible job on your hands. -Nothing's impossible in my book. This is a war-- a war against the most vicious kind of human scavengers. So I'm taking a calculated risk. Many of the wetbacks recently seem to come from this area. Now, there's a man with a boat-- a fishing boat. Now-- [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi, Fred. You ready to go? -Yep. -Now, Jim, what about the money? -You're gonna have to carry me this one. -Well, what do you think I've been doing? -I know. I know. Everything in the book has happened to me in these past six months. But this charter is a big one. Just give me a few days, huh? Just three lousy days. I'm going anyway, Fred. So why not make it easy between us? -Jim. Remember, this is the last time. -Thanks. Hi, Harvey. Hey, wait 'til you see this. How about that? That's worth twice what I owe ya. -Oh, yeah, and stop tearin' your shirt. I-- I didn't open my mouth. Why does a guy like you leave the Coast Guard? -I served my hitch. How about the groceries? Ah, look Harvey, I can't miss on this. It'll take me off the hook. It'll square me all around. What do you want? A mortgage on my life? -Well, what about the Sheriff's attachment? You're covered, aren't ya? -The groceries are on your boat. -Thanks , Harvey. Here. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Buenos dias, senor. It's such a fine day, eh? -What do you guys want? -Senor, did we say we want something? -No, I said it. -We'd like to talk to you about a little business for your boat. -I'm doing all right. Now shove off. I'm busy. -Such a fine business you are doing, senor. We can help you out of this spot. -No, thanks. I'll do it my way. -Well, uh, you are losing your boat, not us. -I'm not losing my boat. Now, get out of here. [MUSIC PLAYING] SHANKS: Hey you. Are you Benson? -That's right. SHANKS: I'm Shanks, your new charter. -Oh, well, glad to see ya. -You call this thing a deep-sea fishing boat? -You don't need a battleship. Look, if you'll come aboard, I'd like to shove off. -Well, what's your rush? I got some more baggage coming. -[WHISTLING]. Is this the baggage? -Yeah, yeah, I forgot to tell ya. I like to have a little fun with my fishing. This is Sally. -Well, come on. Let's go, eh? -He thinks he's Captain Bly. -Ah, don't pay any attention to him. -What's the matter? Hurt your feelings, Captain Bly? -My name is Benson-- Jim Benson. [MOTOR STARTS] -Surprised you're in a terrible hurry. Are you sure you own this boat? -You can check the papers. -I may do that. [MUSIC PLAYING] And I said I got the fishing report just before I come aboard. And they said the big ones are runnin' off the coast of Mexico. And that's where I want to go! -OK, OK! It's your money we're ridin' on. [BOAT MOTOR] SALLY: Hey! What's goin' on up there? How do you make a cup of coffee on board this yacht anyway? -He'll tell ya. -So, that's the way you make coffee. -Yeah. When it starts to boil, turn down the gas. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I thought you were comin' down here to catch a sailfish or somethin'. -That's what I thought too. But I don't think Captain Benson would know a marlin if we saw one. -It was your idea to fish down here, remember? The big ones are down here. -Captain Benson's a funny man, a very funny man. Listen to me, Benson. I hired you to get me a fish. I even bothered to try to tell you where they were. Now you just paddle this little tub around and find me a fish. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Cold beer? A little slurp? -OK, Shanks, I got one spotted. -Where is he? I don't see him. -Oh, that figures. Here. -Where? Bluefin? Where do you see him? -Come on, settle down. Here's your pole. -Let's go. Let's go. I see him now. Go on. Get the boat started. Hurry up! Circle around him. Don't run over him. Go ahead. Circle around. Get in front. I'll lay this bait right in his beak. Ah! I got him. I've got him. -No, don't wind him, please. -Keep away from here. I'll handle this. Oh, this is great. Boy, I'll tell you this is wonderful. Oh, just out now. Isn't that great? Ah, Captain. We got him. He doesn't know the difference between seaweed and swordfish. -I saw that marlin, Shanks. He's out there. -Oh, sure he's out there all right. Captain Seaweed. -Hey! Take it easy. -Now, that's the first thing Captain Seaweed's done that pleases me. -Glad it pleases somebody. -Some people please easily. -Well, you can say that again because I pleased mighty easy when I hired you. -[ANGRILY] I saw that marlin, Shanks. He's out there. Just try and stay sober long enough to hook him. -Is that so? Well, I'm so sure you're the worst fisherman on the water that I'll make you a little bet-- a man's bet. Double or nothin'-- that's the bet. You get me a fish . And I'll pay you double. But you don't get me any fish, you don't get nothing. -Now we'll see if he's Captain Bly or Captain Seaweed. -Just be sure you have the money to pay off. [BOAT MOTOR] [DRAG SOUND] -Marlin! Marlin! [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, straight up. [DRAG SOUNDS] Tighten the line. -Help, Captain, my line's runnin' out. Get me some slack. Get me some slack. I can't stop him. He's runnin away. Go with him. Go with him. -We're in position. Let him run. SHANKS: Captain, do something! -Don't throw on the drag. -You take care of your end. Now you lost him for me. -Oh-- if you'd listened to me, you'd have had him. SHANKS: Well, don't blame me for your lousy boatmanship and your lousy equipment. Are you tryin' to say I lost the fish on purpose? -That's exactly what I'm trying to say. That double or nothin' was a little too rich for your blood, eh? -Well, that bet still goes. No fish, no money. -Oh, you pay up, all right, and now. -That's what you think. -I spent a long time gettin' this boat. And you're not gonna sink it. Pay up or swim! -All right. All right, I'll pay. All right, I'll pay. But get me off this boat first. -That suits me fine. The nearest town is Delgado, Mexico. -Well, get me there. [MOTOR STARTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Capitan Benson! Capitan Benson! Capitan Benson! [MUSIC PLAYING] Capitan Benson! -Hi, Pedro! Here. Catch. No, you don't, Shanks. If you've changed your mind, I haven't. Pay up. -I'll pay you in private. -OK-- in the cabin. Hey! Oh! What you got to say? Hey boy. Nice to see ya. PEDRO: Capitan Benson, you've been away so long. BENSON: Yeah, yeah, I know I have. What do you got to say for yourself, huh? PEDRO: I have been waiting for very long, Capitan Benson. This time you'll take me fishing. [MUSIC PLAYING] PEDRO: [INAUDIBLE]. -Hey, wait a minute! We're adrift! Senor, take a hold of this, will ya? PEDRO: It was my fault that the boat ran away Capitan Benson. But this time I tie it very good. -One more slip like that, Mr. Pedro. And I'll have you broken to second mate. PEDRO: I do not know what that is, Capitan. But it does not sound good. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, senor Benson! Ha! Such a pleasure to see you. Senor, mucho tiempo. -Hi, did an American come in here? -Si senor, three days ago this little Americano comes in. -No, no, not three days ago, now, just before I came in? -No, senor, no ones comes in. You know, businesses is bad. -I'll see you later, Alfonso. Excuse me, senorita, I'm looking for an American. Uh, he had on kind of a loud hat. It was, uh, pink with-- -Senor. The Americano you were asking about is gone away. -Gone away, where, how? -Don't be angry with me. I only saw him go away in Gonzalez's taxi. -I've got to stop him. -Wait, senor! There is no taxi. No other cars-- very difficult. -Of course, I already know that. Thanks. -You did not find the Americano, amigo? -No, I didn't find him. Louse. He ran out on me. And he owes me $800.00. -Senor, that is almost all the money in the world. -To me, it's all the money in the world. -And you-- you-- in the spot, senor. -That's a nice, mild way of putting it. -But you are the finest, honest man. Who's gonna make the trouble for you? Nobody. -That's not a fair description of the Sheriff. Oh, I better get back. It's one thing to lose my boat but another to go to jail. -Oh, no, senor. Ha, ha. Today is my pleasure. Many times you've bring the fish to help the Mexican people. We remember. -If St. Peter stops me at the gate, I'm sending for you. -Gracias, senor. -What are you doing here? -I came up to see the big payoff? Where's it gonna be? -You don't know your friend very well, do ya? -At least I have a friend. -You had a friend. He ran out on ya. -I'll cherish the memory. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOTOR STARTS] [FAILED START] -Senor, ha, you are having the trouble, no? -I'm having the trouble, yes. What do you two know about it? -Whatever is the matter with your boat, Mr. Benson, I assure you we had nothing to do with it. -Then how did you know I'd be down here in Delgado when I didn't even know it myself? -We don't know, senor. It is what you call a happy coincidence. -Ah, then let's hear your explanation then. -Mr. Benson, I am a legitimate exporter and importer. You can verify that by checking. Therefore, it is quite natural that I travel about a good deal. -You two have all the answers, don't you? Well, here's my answer to the question that you came down to ask me. I'm not interested in that part of your exporting business that does not show on your business license. Now, get out. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, gracias, Antonio. Ah, senor, you decided to stay, eh? -Alfonso, where can I get some gas? -At Gonzalez Taxi-- he has maybe five or six gallons. But he has gone with the Americano. -I've got to have more than that. That's not enough. -There's not more gas in Delgado, senor. You will have to go to Puerto Lobos and get-- -Yes, yes, I know. The only way I can get there is Gonzalez Taxi if and when he shows up. -That is right, senor. The gas is expensive. You need the money, no? -Yeah. With Gonalez's taxi fare, it will be a good $40. Can you loan me the money, Alfonso? -My life, senor, she is yours. Everything is yours. But I never have $40 American dollars. -Isn't there somebody in town that can loan me that much money? There must be somebody. -Senor, 400, maybe pesos, is almost a fortune to us. We are a very poor people. You see the land they give us to live in. But many-- hmm. -Where'd you take the American? -I take him to Puerto Lobo. -Did he stay in town? Do you know? -No, and he take the bus right away. -Uh, look, uh, I have to go to Puerto Lobo too. I need some gas. Would you take me there? -It's impossible, senor. I have to fix up this motor. And I also have no money. -Senor, if you have the money. -Forget it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. -Yes? -I, uh, uh, may I sit down please? -It's a public place. -I guess, uh, that was a pretty sad fishing trip, huh? -You're the only one who's guessing. -I asked for that. -That's right. -Hey, look, eh, with, uh, Shanks running out on me like this, uh, I'm in pretty much of a spot. And, uh, he not only took a powder on me. But, uh, someone dumped a can of beer in my gas. I'm stranded. -That's too bad. -You see, uh, I need a fresh supply of gas. Can you lend me the money? $40? I don't mind. All I want is a yes or a no. -There. $1.22. I was just having this drink to get up enough courage to ask you for fare back to San Diego. [LAUGHTER] BENSON: As long as I can remember, I always wanted a boat of my own. So as soon as I got out of the Coast Guard, I, uh, found The Tardy, put a down payment on her, and, uh, well, I've been in business ever since. You really love the sea, don't you? -Yeah, you know, I always feel kind of restless when I'm not on board. I don't now. So something's missing, like uh, like a guy without a wife, I guess. Does that make any sense to you at all? -Mhm. -Looks like we put our troubador to sleep. I guess I should get some sleep too. -I wish I'd met you earlier on this trip. -That's nice. What are you going to do about all this, Jim? Rob a bank? -I can't. There isn't any. Hey, this isn't fair. You know a lot more about me now than I know about you. -Oh? -Yeah, I don't even know where you live. San Diego? -Mhm. -That's what I like-- a talkative gal. Well, good night. -Good night. Uh, don't worry now Sally. I'll work it out all right. -I'm betting $1.22-- on the nose. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, senor! We have been waiting. -Don't you guys ever give up. -You know, Benson, for a man in your predicament I don't understand your attitude. We want to make some money for you. -See, all we want you to do is run a few Mexicans in United States. -Oh, so that's it, huh? -That's all. -Well, goodbye boys. Come on! Let's go. -No, let me put it this way. We don't force anybody. See , these poor laborers come to us begging for a chance to get across. You know, the money they make gives them an opportunity for some sort of start. -Es verdad, senor. We don't harm anybody. All we want to do is arrange things around so everybody is happy. -Except the two respective governments. What about violating international law? -Benson, you're smart enough to know that there are some laws that do more harm than good. Well, like the prohibition law years ago. That's your opinion, not mine. Come on, let's go. -Benson, I'll lay my cards on the table. You know, you're staring out through bars right now. Our proposition is one run and enough money to get you in the clear. Look, Benson, you know these waters. You've got the right boat. Five hours, that's all. -You will be doing the Mexicans a great favor, senor. -What about the Coast Guard? -Look, that's the main reason we picked you. You've been one. You know how they operate. You're smart enough to avoid them. -Thanks. -We're offering you your boat and your freedom for a five-hour job. [MUSIC PLAYING] Benson, make up your mind. -When will I get paid? -As soon as the load's on board. -American money? -Absolutely. -OK, but just one run and enough gas to get me to San Diego. That's got to be a part of the deal too. -Two full tanks. -When do we make the run? -Tonight, senor. -Give me time to fill the tanks, won't you? -Huh? Oh, si, senor. -We'll take the Mexicans out in a little cove up the coast. -Don't you ever have a match? -Sometimes. [MUSIC PLAYING] SALLY: Jim. -Sally, wha? -Where did you get the gas, Jim? -Oh, I just happened to run into some tourists from San Diego. They let me have some. -I found the instructions at the bottom my overnight case. Why didn't you tell me you were in trouble? -I'll straighten it out. -You shouldn't have run out with the boat, Jim. -Everything I have is tied up in this boat of mine. And I'm no gonna let anybody take it away from me. I just happen to have a lousy streak of luck. Got on the debt a little. And boom, these money-grabbing jokers. They throw me in the hock. SALLY: And the trip with Shanks? -Yeah, I took a chance. I figured I'd come in with enough money to square it all off. -What are you going to do now? -I'll work it out. -Don't do anything foolish. -Don't worry. I'm not going to. -You ran out for the boat. -I was trying to save it. -Just don't do anything you'll have to keep squaring yourself. -Sally, please will you-- -Are we going to San Diego? -Yeah, yeah, sure. But, uh, first I'll have to tune up the motor before we leave. I'll check with you in the morning. You, uh, better run along now and get some rest, huh? -Good night. -Good night. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Put that out. What do you think you're doing? -This time I had a match. -What are you two doing here. It's not time yet. -We think it's time. -Or-- as we say in America it's a free country. A man can change his mind. I'm not going to make the run. I'll pay you for the gas as soon as I get back to San Diego. [MUSIC PLAYING] --[SPEAKING SPANISH] when I come back, and she will have everything in the world for her and the little kids. Muchas gracias. -You see how it is, Benson? You're doing these guys a big favor. -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -All right, get on the boat. The others will be here soon. All right, let's go. Come on. Come on. -Are you you ready, senor? -Un momento. Un momento. -It is no good when I tell you. You are a fool peon. So why does somebody pay the fortune for picking cotton? -You heard the Senor Boudin. These ranchers are very rich. Do you remember when Garcia came back ? Madre mia, he had the wrist watch. And did you see how he lighted cigarettes? With a little machine. -Si, and do you remember Jose Mendez? He never came back? -It is too bad. -Are you coming or staying? -Un momento. Camina mia, I am coming back with a fortune. -Please Juan, please do not leave us. It is no good. -All right, I'm going. [MUSIC PLAYING] -For your sake, I hope they didn't see us. Now stay on course. [MUSIC PLAYING] They're still out there. We're getting close. We're gonna drop these wetbacks off. I wonder if they'll go by. Cut it over, Benson. And pick up speed. [MUSIC PLAYING] They're cutting with us. COAST GUARD [VOICEOVER]: Ahoy, fishing boat. Stand by. Stand by. -They want to board. If they try, gun it. We'll make a run for it. -They'll blast us to pieces. -Take your pick. COAST GUARD: Attention, you. Are you OK? What are you doing out here? -I took a party down to Delgado. Lost the usual big one. COAST GUARD: That's a long, tall run. I'll bring over a jug of coffee to warm you up. -Oh, no thanks, Captain. I, uh, I'm plenty warm. Yeah, I just made a pot of coffee about five minutes ago. Anything special tonight, Captain? I said anything special? CAPTAIN: Yeah, we got a tip they're gonna try to run in a bunch of wetbacks. Seen anything? -Uh, no, nothing. You're the first boat I've seen between here and Delgado. -Well, see you in the harbor. -See Benson, there's nothing to it. It's all over just like that. -Yeah, and it's all over for me too just like that. -All right, Benson, get these guys over to the beach and dump them off. [MUSIC PLAYING] Watch it. -Hey, what's the idea? -Boss's orders. He might have another job for ya. -He said one trip. That was all. -As we say in America, it's a free country. A guy can change his mind. Now don't try any of your crazy ideas to get away. Look at what happened last time. And I don't think you're in position to do any talkin'. [MUSIC PLAYING] -[SPEAKING SPANISH]. -But that's impossible. Capitan Benson takes some wetbacks in his boat, senor. -[SPEAKING SPANISH]. -No, senor. [SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -Jim, Jim. -Oh, hi. -Did you run a load of wetbacks across the border last night? -Oh, no wait a minute. Wait a minute-- slow down. What's this doubletalk? -When I left here last night, you were filling the gas tanks. Today they are empty. Look, Jim, the police are in town. They're asking a lot of questions about you. They're on their way down here right now. -You're right Sally. I made the run. But I had a gun at my back. You remember that station wagon you saw last night? Well, they weren't tourists. -They told you if you didn't run the wetbacks, they'd kill you. -Yeah, and believe me. There was no way out. -There is now. Just tell the police who did it. -Don't be silly. What chance would I have finding an outfit like this. It's not just one man. Who knows how many there are? -The police will find them, Jim. Just tell them who's behind this whole thing. -That's easy to say. -You've got to tell them who. Now's your chance. Jim. -Senor. -Yeah, come on in. -I am so sorry to trouble you, Senor Benson. But unfortunately, there are a few questions I must ask you. -Oh? All right. -Senor, did your boat leave the harbor last night? -Yeah, I got some water in my gas. And after I cleaned it out, I made a trial spin to see if it was OK. -But the townspeople tell me you had no gas. -Oh, yes, uh, that's right. I did get rid of most of it. But, uh as I say, I salvaged a couple of gallons-- enough to try it out. -I see. -What, uh, seems to be the trouble? -Jefe-- [SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . Senor, someone with a boat, uh, about like this took a number of Mexicans illegally into the United States. -Oh, well, in that case I'm sorry. But I'm afraid I can't help you any. -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH]. -Pronto! Senor, it appears you are correct. Our apologies for having troubled you senor. Senora, buenas dias. -You should have told them, Jim. -Sally, nobody in the world is going to believe that I was forced into it. I'd not only lose my boat. I'd be thrown into jail! -Please, Jim, please. I know they'd believe you. Let me call them back. -No, wait. Look, even if they did believe me why the minute I stepped out of jail I'd be killed. There's too many of them to fight. -Look Jim, you've been planted down here on purpose for the Immigration Department. I'm a part of that plan. -What did you say? -They're using you to help uncover these men. -Then we're not stranded down here. And you're not the innocent little girl who's in a spot. -That's right. -And all those pretty words-- those uh, nice little things between us. That's all part of the act too, huh? -No, Jim, they were all mine. -Now you expect me to believe that? Me the prize sucker of the year? -But you're not a sucker. Don't you realize they picked you over everyone else? -Oh, well thank them very much for me. Yeah, thank them for toying with my life. And while you're at it you can also tell them that I've had it. I'm through! -You can't quit now. What's happened to you anyway? Are you scared? -Yeah, yeah I am scared. And if your friends in San Diego are so brave, tell them to come down here and mix it up with these guys. Let's see how much guts they've got. All right, if that's the way you feel about it, you can stay down here and run wetbacks the rest of your life. I don't want any part of it. -OK, I will. Tonight, tomorrow night,and as long as I feel like it. And you can tell them that too! [MUSIC PLAYING] -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -Hey, you think it's wise to make another run tonight? But the police are checking the whole town. Let's not go tonight. We have to go tonight. They need the men. -One or two days make no difference. -One or two days may cost me $1,000. -But Steve. -You're not by any chance getting scared? -Me amigo, I am always cautious about endangering my freedom, especially when it is the hands of another. STEVE: Are you presuming to tell me I don't know how to run this? -What do you want? -I'm still waiting for my pesos. I cannot go. So I won't the pesos back. -If you cannot go, you can't have the pesos back. -What do you mean not go? He's got to go. -I thought senor-- -Senor boss says you got to go. Now andale. -You give me my pesos back. Policia! Policia! STEVE: Stop him. Stop him, now! Bring the car around back. We've got to get him out of here. -OK, Steve. -Right, I told you to get the gas in those barrels. Now, hurry up. Pronto! Andale! [MUSIC PLAYING] -The senorita was watching the show from the outside. I thought we better let her look from the inside. Shall we get some information from the senorita? -We haven't got time. Just getting out of here will take us 'til dark. Lock her up in there. -Si. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Yes? -Calder's here. -Calder? Oh, uh, uh, all right, uh, send him in. -Inspector? -Well, this is an unexpected pleasure, Inspector Calder. -Hello. -Hello, it's not every day the Chief drops in on us sir. Uh, you'll find everything in order. The, uh, files, and uh, here's my report sir. -I'm not referring to written reports. I'm talking about the life of one human being-- James Benson. He's in great danger. By what authority? -But sir, something had to be done, and quickly. I-- I took a calculated risk. -With your job too, Sherman. Now get on that phone and get Benson out of there. -But sir, we can't give up. If you knew how they were treating these Mexicans, what they were to them, you'd go along with this. -You get him out of there. And that's an order. -Yes sir. Get me the Chief of Police in Puerto Lobo, Mexico. [CAR SOUND] -Don't seem to be many people around. -Good time to get the gas. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi. Any of you seen the American senorita? -No, senor. Have a drink. -No thanks. [DOOR KNOCK] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Did you find the senorita? -No, I didn't. Look, if you see her, Alfonso, tell her I'm at the fiesta, will you? -Si senor, como no? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Sally! Sally! -Oh, he's coming after me. He's got a knife. -Come on. You'll be a lot safer here. -You were right, Jim. If you'd called the police, you'd never gotten out of this town alive. -Senor Benson! Ha, you find a senorita, eh? Here. Have a drink. Everybody's dancing and happy. Oh, senor it's muy bueno. [SPEAKING SPANISH] . It's muy bueno. Un momento. -We got to get out of this town quick. -How? -The boat's our only chance. -But you don't have the key, Jim. You're out of gas. -Yeah, the key doesn't bother me. It's the gas. Now listen, Sally, we got the coast to, uh, wait a minute. I got an idea. Where's Pedro? -There he is. -Hi Pedro. Hi! Ho ho! Woo! Hey! Oh, ah! Boom! Ah, now listen carefully, Pedro. We're in trouble. We're being watched. -Si, Capitan Benson. -That is fine. Now, we've got to get away in my boat. But we need gas. -I can get it for you, senor. I have to get it out sometimes. -OK, Pedro, good, good. Now, you get it. And you hide it, uh, let's see. Hide it in the bushes right where the path turns and goes down to the pier. You know the place I mean? -Si. -OK, but don't take any chances. -But senor, you're not smiling. -After you've hid it, come back and dance with Maria. Then we'll know everything is all set, OK? Ah, Pedro! Go right away. You're being watched. -What will a few gallons do us? -It'll get us away from here-- maybe to Cava Blanco. And then we can radio them for help. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What happens when Pedro comes back? -So you dance with Casilla, and I'll dance with a senora. Dance with him to the far side of the plaza. When you see me, you be there. -He'll kill you. -No, no. They need me to make a run. Uh, I'll meet you later where, uh, Pedro is hiding the gas, OK? -OK. -I know exactly how you feel. [MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] [POURING SOUND] [MAN SINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Where's Pedro? -He'll be here. -Jim, I've been want to explain to you why I'm mixed up in all this. -Forget it. It isn't an act this time. -No. -Here he comes. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Maria, would you like to dance? -Oh, yes, Pedro. -Oh, let's change dances with Garcia and the senora. -Pedro, you have been drinking. -Madre mia. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Wise guy, eh? -What are you talking about? -What's the idea of tricking us? -What are you trying to start, Benson? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, somebody did. I'm sorry, senora, are you all right? Are you not hurt? -No, I'm all right. It was nothing, senor. It was nothing. -Alfonso, have another drink. Excuse me, senora. How about it , Alfonso? -[SPEAKING SPANISH]. -No, I have got to have on. Come on. -[SPEAKING SPANISH] . -Excuse me a minute, Alfonso. I just want to see if Sally is in the room. -All right, senor. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Where is the Senor Benson? -He went to talk to the senorita. [DOOR KNOCK] -Senor Benson. Get the key. -Sally! Sally! SALLY: Here. [MUSIC PLAYING] -It's gone. They must have taken it to the cove to load the wetbacks. Let's go back and get the taxi. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sounds like Pedro . [MUSIC PLAYING] He's hurt. Here take this. Fill the car. Now be careful. [MUSIC PLAYING] What happened Pedro? -Two bad men. They wanted me to tell where when you were missing where you had gone. But I did not tell. -They'll pay for this, Pedro. Believe me. By God, they'll pay for this. -I did not tell, senor. I did not tell. -Ah, Pedro I know. You're a very brave boy. Can you make it to the Padre's house? -Si, I think so. -Don't you tell the Padre what's happened. Tell him I'll be back soon. -And then you will take me fishing with you? -Then I will take you fishing with me. [KNOCKING] Sally. Come on. Let's go, quick. -Is he all right? -Yeah, he's all right. You take the wheel. I'll push you as far as I can so as to not make any noise. -Jose! I'm sure they went that way. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] -They're getting away in the taxi. -Let's get the station wagon. -Si. [MUSIC PLAYING] -There they go. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I've got an idea. Hold on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Looks like they haven't loaded yet. -You suppose anyone is guarding the boat? -I don't know. It's just possible no one is there. -Faster. Faster. -If we can get him to chase us into American waters, we might be able to nail 'em. We need every break we can get. -There is the first one. -This is killing me. My legs! [CAR HORN] What's the matter you idiots? Didn't you see that car? Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Sally! Come on! Get off! Get off! Come on. Pronto! Pronto! Come on. Get off. Come on. Pronto! Pronto! Come on. Get off! Get off! Pronto! Pronto! You better stay here. I'll need you for evidence. -Oh, mucho gracias. [SPEAKING SPANISH] . -Get in the cabin. Get in the cabin. Stay there! Hey, hurry up! Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Check the gas. -The tanks are full. -Great! Now we'll see if I'm Captain Bly or Captain Seaweed. -They got by Reeser. Come on. [BOAT SOUND] Let's get the boat. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Here they come. -Their boat is faster isn't it? -Yeah, but we've got a pretty good start on 'em. -Yes. Yes, I see. Thanks. Some sort of a fiesta going on down there. The police got our message late. Benson and the boat are gone. -Maybe he's headed back here. Notify the Coast Guard. -Yes sir. [BOAT SOUNDS] -Are we getting close? -Just a few miles more. We're starting to get light. -We're getting closer. -I better run you into shore. -No, Jim, I'm staying. I'm as much a part of this as you are. Besides, you see, Jim-- -Hold on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -That was a close one. -Yeah, I don't think we can play this more than once. If the follow us, we make a run for it. That might give us enough leeway to drag them under something if we're lucky. -They must be around here somewhere. -Jim. -Yeah. -You remember the headlines in the paper not long ago? "Wetback Runners Murdered Boatman." -Yeah. -He was my father-- Fred Parker. -He was your father? -He was running wetbacks under the same conditions you were. -Wow! Now it all makes sense. Their coming back. All right, hold on. [BOAT SOUNDS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -There! [BOAT SOUNDS] -That might be our second break. If we can just reach that freighter. -Get ready. He's getting close. Shoot! [GUNSHOT] -Get down, Sally. -Look out! He's going to pass us. -Senor, I want to go home. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BOAT HORN] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Call the Coast Guard. My radio is out. Hurry! -The fishing boat seems to be in trouble. Call the Coast Guard! [MUSIC PLAYING] STEVE: We've got 'em cornered. -Shoot! Shoot! [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -If you could shoot straight, we'd of had him. There they are. -Go back! Go back! [MUSIC PLAYING] BENSON: They're getting away! -They're not gettin' away, Benson. We've radioed a plane. -Boy, are we glad to see you. -To tell you the truth. We've been looking for you. -OK, Captain, I'll head in. But while you're out looking, try finding a guy by the name of Carl Shanks. He ran out on me. He owes me $800. -Say, Benson wanted us to look for a man named Carl Shanks. I gather the guy is a louse. He ran out on an $800 charter. -That's what I call a louse. Before you let him at me, be sure and tell them that $800 is deposited to his account. That kid is rough. -I know. We trained him. -Senor, this way we'll never get home. [MUSIC PLAYING]
