[guitar music plays] So what's the plan for tomorrow? City? I dunno. My mom might find out. Just tell her the truth. It's Field Day, right? Nobody cares. Yeah, she probably won't care. Rex? Yeah. I guess. Rex doesn't cut class. For God's sake, Rex, it's not class, it's field day. Do you really give a shit about that? No. You know, Scott and Flip are in. Scott even had to miss his flute lesson tomorrow. Do you know how big of a deal that is? You made Scott miss his flute lesson? It's for his own good. He needs to get out and socialize more. So are you in, Rex? I said yeah. I mean. I guess. Stop bothering him. Anyway, didn't you graduate like three years ago? Shouldn't you be away at school? No way. Everybody knows the coolest guy in school always hangs around after he graduates. Anyway, it's Field Day tomorrow, nobody cares and you're all totally fine to miss it. Right, Rex? No. I mean... right. Okay. I'll see you guys in the train station tomorrow at 10:00. [Rex plays guitar] Up a bit late Rex, no? Well it's Field Day tomorrow, so I wasn't gonna go to school. What's that, where you play sports all day and stuff? Yeah. Okay, I think you could skip that. What are you talking about? Shit. Did you say you're not going to school tomorrow? Yeah, but it's Field Day, so I don't really have to go. I told him it would be all right if he didn't go. Why? Why shouldn't he go? He hates sports. I do. Maybe he doesn't try hard enough. He needs to work more at it! Marie, he's 16 years old. I think that ship has sailed. Let him do what he wants. He's always by himself! Maybe if he got out and played sports more he'd socialize, make some friends, maybe even have a girlfriend! They just laugh at me when I try, ma. I'm not good at it. I think you should go. You can't spend all day alone playing your guitar and reading comic books. I was gonna go to the city with Chip and them. That's socializing. Well, okay. If that's what you want to do. But I bet Linda's son is going. Kevin? Yeah, of course he's going. He loves that stuff. That's what he does. Will you leave him alone? Anthony! Why must you always say the opposite! You've taught him that he doesn't have to listen to a thing that I say! Rex... Do what you want to do. I'm not going. I'm not going. Not. Going. [Guitar music plays] Hey coach. Sucks that we had to have Field Day indoors this year. That's all right, Kevin. We'll make due. I hate the rain. All right, everybody, relay race coming up next. Relay coming up Hey, Kevin. Relay race is comin' up. Now remember guys, this race is the most important thing we're ever going to do, so make sure to give it everything you got! I always do Okay, everybody relay race! Relay time! I want the blue team on the left, red team on the right. Let's go! What's up rex? I thought you'd cut with your friends today. Yeah, no, I... Whatever. I'm here.

Victory party at my house! Vodka and coke on my dad! Hey coach, um... My arms...I think I did something...to them. Yeah, right. Yeah. Hey man. Did you see Kevin? Holy cow was that a thing of beauty! Hey Rex, how are the games going? My arms kinda hurt. My God, Rex, look at your wrists! They look like boxing gloves! Come on, we're going to the nurse. [guitar music plays] This isn't too bad. You'll be out of the casts in a couple of months. I'm going to set this now. It's gonna hurt. That's good. Usually they scream when I do that. [guitar music plays] I told you that you shouldn't go. I told you! All he was doing was sitting in his room all day He needed to get out and socialize a little. And what's he supposed to do now, huh? How the hell did you do this, Rex? Did you fly off the handle and lose your temper? Jesus! Oh Rex. My poor Rex. Geez. Hadda happen right before summer. It happened on Field Day. Field Day's always right before summer. I just mean he's gonna have to be stuck in those things for two months. It's gonna get hot. He could have come to the city with us. and the last one is C? That's good, Rex. Okay, that's it for the multiple choice section. Sorry you had to give me the test separate from everyone else, Mrs. Lawrence. Hey, it was a bad break, Rex. Oh. Sorry. I meant... Sorry, Rex. Anyway, we couldn't have you read your answers in front of the whole class. All right, let's just try to get through this essay and then I'll check and see how everyone else is doing. How do you want to do it? You'll have to say it aloud. Okay... Hamlet... Okay, I'm ready. [clears throat] In William Shakespeare's play "Hamlet," the title character... ...Hamlet... [laughter] is, uh, indecisive, and.... Cannot come to a.... [more laughter] Go ahead. when he finds When he discovers that his uncle Claudius murdered his father in order to become king Hamlet had the chance to kill Claudius when he is praying [laughter] when Claudius is praying...

Yeah. Hey Rex. How'd you do that? In the relay race. Huh. All right, well, you can sit out today if you want. Hey Kev, I want to go over those moves again, that I was showing you before. [guitar music plays] Stop! What happened to you? Huh? Your arms. You didn't hear? No. Did you get into a fight or something? Yes. Wait, really? Yeah, you should see the other guy. Oh my God. Yeah, well, he... No, it was...it was a race. Wait, what? Yeah, the relay race. On Field Day. It was classic! Maybe if you hadn't been such an idiot I wouldn't have had to run so fast I ran into a wall! You ran into a wall? It was epic. No, it wasn't. You didn't even see. Nobody even noticed. Rex, all that matters is we won the race. Can you sign my yearbook, Rex? No. Can I sign yours? Okay. "Dear Rex: So sorry how everything turned out for you. I see all other signatures in here are making fun of your casts. That sucks. I know you'll have a great summer anyway. - Anna" [upbeat song plays] Let's get dancin' Let's get dancin' let's get dancin', everybody come on let's dance on let's get dancin' let's get dancin' let's get dancin' let's get dancin' let's get dancin', everybody come on let's dance on [song ends] [phone rings] Hello?
