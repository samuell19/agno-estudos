THE LAST METRO Paris, September 1942. Half of France is occupied by the Germans. The Occupied and Free zones... are officially divided by a borderline. In Paris, the curfew... is imposed at 11 p. m. No one can afford to miss the last metro. Hungry Parisians queue up to buy food... and flock to theatres for warmth. Movies are just as crowded... playing to full houses. At the Montmartre Theatre, rehearsals are under way... though its director, Lucas Steiner, has fled France: He didn?t have much choice! Excuse me, Mlle. I noticed you... I wonder... What time it is? It?s 6:40. No, I?ve got a watch. What else? Are you lost? No, I live around here. In that case... so long! Wait... I don?t want you to think I?m on the make... I mean it. Why would I think that? I was in the caf?... making a call... I noticed you... I mean it was your eyes... and your expression. So I figured... What? Well, this is my lucky day, so I thought... we might have a drink and talk. I?m not thirsty and not interested. Let me be! You?ve got me all wrong. D?you think I do this every day? No, only every other day! Stop pestering me. Okay, have it your way... No, wait... let me explain: do you know what it means to be attracted to someone? Please, believe me... I haven?t accosted a strange woman in... 4 years. What an honor... Look, that?s enough! D?you want a public scandal? Think about it. Let me have something: a name... an address, a phone number. I?m Bernard. You want my number? Great! Let me write it down. Odeon 84-00. Odeon 84-00... Hey, who?re you kidding? That?s the Talking Clock number! Who?s that boy? He?s the concierge?s son. She works at the theatre. What did he do to you? He patted my head. Let?s go and wash your hair out! Come back here at once! Is the theatre closed? No. Go in through the stage door. I?ve got an appointment. Mr Granger? Yes. Mrs Steiner is expecting you. Follow me. Beautiful theatre! It beats the Grand Guignol, right? It?s twice as big... I?ve been here before... I saw Mrs Steiner in "The Cherry Orchard". Any news of Lucas Steiner? The boss? He was lucky... One day, they came looking for him... Here? The Germans? No, the French. They were buzzing all around... but he had already skipped out of Paris. I hear he?s in America... South America... or around there. I hope he can work. The offices are upstairs. Bernard Granger... Mr Merlin. I recognized you. Merlin?s our business manager. He handles the finances. Wait here. A few minutes. Okay, thanks. Marion, I know Rosen?s Aryan Certificate is a fake... but they won?t check it with a magnifying glass. He?s got no work permit. He?ll claim he lost it. We could use our contacts. No, we may need them. With the papers he?s got, he manages to work... at the film studios. He?s lucky they?re so careless... but here, we stick to the rules: no permit, no work! What can I tell Rosen? The truth: no Jews in Marion Steiner?s theatre! Rosen, come this way... I didn?t know you were here! I?ll be right back. I?ll go get Marion. Did you explain my case to Mrs Steiner? What did she say? Sorry Rosen, she won?t hire a Jew... I just can?t believe it. Anywhere else, I?d expect this... but in Lucas Steiner?s own theatre... it?s truly an outrage! Come in. Hold it! I want to understand. What? I considered myself lucky to play here but if I must lower my pants... to prove I?m not a Jew... thanks, but no thanks! Besides, I refuse to take anyone?s job away from him. You?ve got it all wrong... That actor was not slated for the role of the tutor... but for a walk-on in the third act. Believe me! Believe me, Granger... You were my first choice as Marion?s leading man. You must realize our position... We need an okay for the play. We?re still waiting for the Censor?s visa. This is Bernard Granger. I?ve heard great things about you... from friends who saw you at the Grand Guignol. And I trust Jean-Loup. At first, l was doubtful about the Grand Guignol... but finally, I enjoyed playing "The Skeleton". I never saw it because I work at night. In the past... my husband managed everything. I knew nothing about administration... and business details. I had to learn quickly. Let?s discuss your contract. Right now? Let?s get it over with. What did you earn at Grand Guignol? I was looking for you. Here?s the script. It?s wholesome reading. Memorize it, child! This one? Yes, thanks. I couldn?t find it at the theatre bookshop. It hasn?t been published. I?ve never heard of it. It?s a Norwegian play, by a Norwegian playwright... Karen Bergen, a genuinely Norwegian name. Lucas discovered it and had it translated. Do you speak Norwegian? Neither do I. But I bet the critics will pan the translation! D?you know Granger? Is he here? In my office. I don?t know him... but we almost met. Hello! We expected you at Lucien?s house-warming party. I couldn?t make it. We?ll meet again. "I hereby declare I am not Jewish... and to the best of my knowledge... my parents or grandparents are not Jewish." How did it go? Okay! Great. I?ll see you around. You never really wanted to be an actress. I enjoyed the job I had. I know. If Lucas hadn?t kidnapped you... you?d still be in fashion. Right, and that?s not all: he said that if I refused, he?d ask Coco Chanel to fire me! It sounds just like him. Can I turn the lights off? Yes. I?m waiting for you. Right. Oh hell! Daxiat! I forgot we had a dinner date. I?ll see you later. Goodnight. Don?t let him see you... I forgot to tell you... that I?m having dinner with Daxiat. He can help us get the Censor?s visa... I sort of promised you might come. You shouldn?t have. I don?t see how you can associate with him. I don?t have much choice. Remember why he panned "Britannicus"? Yes, he claimed it was an effeminate play. Even so, we need his help for the visa... All I ask is for you to say hello... and also shake his hand. I?ll shake his hand... but no dinner. Figure out some excuse. I?m going home. Raymond, cut the lights. "Fine, Eric. Go to bed now." "Fine, Eric. Go to bed now." Eric hesitates... then turns back to his mother. "Mother, will Mr Carl return?" "l don?t know. What do you think?" "He will return." As Helena?s embroidery... drops from her hands... Carl hears a sound and turns around. "Who?s there?" He sees Helena. "Why are you hiding?" "Leave this house. Your presence here is harmful." "Before I go, you must hear me out." "When Dr Sanders hired me last Spring..." Wait... let?s reverse that... I think it?s best to start with "Last Spring..." "You must hear me out." Hello, darling. "Last Spring, when Dr Sanders hired me..." Come over here. Arlette Guillaume, our set and costume designer. Bernard Granger... he?ll play Carl. You must have seen his act. I don?t think so... Wait... yes, I have seen it. At the Grand Guignol? No, in a very banal role: Just a man... on the prowl. You can?t judge me by that part... I was improvising. You seemed to know it by heart! The rehearsal?s over... but I want to say something. I?m going to stage the play. Like all of you, I?d have preferred... that "Disappearance" be directed by Lucas himself. Fortunately, he left us explicit notes... as to the staging. It goes without saying that... we?ll be guided by his notes. I?ll do my best to help you all. That?s it! May I leave now? Run along. What about Daxiat, the drama critic? Can?t he help us... He got us the Censor?s visa, so let?s not make waves. Can you help me fix my bracelet? The clasp is stuck. You read palms? What do you see? There are two women in you. That?s true. Go on! Raymond, come quickly! I?m scared... I hear noises in the theatre. Don?t worry, Germaine. I?ll take a look. Anybody here? Anybody here? How did you get in? I watched the rehearsal. It looks great. I told you to wait outside, Martine! Calm down. Look what I?ve got. Still interested? I had no money. I?ve got to pay for it tonight. How much? 4 200 francs. It?s 14 lbs! I?ll go ask Mrs Steiner. The Grand Guignol has 100 orchestra seats... 200 with the balcony. You average half a house? Just about. A little more on Sundays... but they average half a house. The seats range from 20 to 40 francs... A daily gross of 6 000. How many players? Mrs Steiner? Excuse me. The ham? Oh, yes. How many? Four actors. Tree of us play two roles each. With the costs, they barely break even. It?s a losing proposition. I?m ready. Shall we go? Goodnight, Mrs Steiner. Goodnight, Marion. Come in. I?ve got your ham. It?s 4 200 frs. 4 200 frs? If it?s too expensive, I can give it back. No. It?ll last me the whole winter. 4 200? Right! Thanks. Here?s the cello. What do I want with a cello? Here?s the animal. Look... 14 pounds! You can?t walk around with a ham in your arms, can you? No, I can?t. Good thinking! Thanks. I?m off. Don?t forget the lights and shutters. The air-raid warden is a real bastard! I?ll remember. Sir? Valentin. Oh, forgive me. I?m so absent-minded these days. No, please don?t apologize... I know I?ve aged a lot. I left a script at the desk for you... a screenplay. Read it and tell me what you think. I won?t detain you. Goodbye Marion. This is for you. I know. Your keys? D?you have a minute? I keep on getting mail for Mr Steiner... Probably from people who don?t know he?s gone. It?s embarrassing. Should I return it to the senders, or give it to you? It?s probably theatre business mail. I?ll take it. D?you want all his mail? - Yes. - Fine. - Thanks. - You?re most welcome. Room service? No, I ate at the theatre. Did the reporter from "Paris Echos" call you ? No. Why? This morning, he was in the hallway with a camera. I told him you weren?t in. He said: "I just want to take a picture of her room." He said it was for a reportage on "The Stars at Home". I told him to call you. Didn?t he call? No. Was I wrong? No, you were right. I hate those snoopers. Are you watering your flowers? It?s not flowers. Vegetables? No. It?s for a pipe... with a match, it smokes. You?ll wind up in jail! Where the hell is she? For Christ?s sake! Do we rehearse, or not? We?re waiting for Nadine. I?ll give her an earful! You know what time it is? You joy-ride with the Boches and I get hell! I was dubbing. We worked late, so they drove me here. You?re not squeamish! I bet you?d accept a role in "Jew S?ss"! And how! But they didn?t have a role for me! Excuse me. I?m sorry. Take your time! You?re only an hour late. What?s your excuse today? Your alarm clock? No, I was dubbing. Must you grab every offer? Can?t you leave the dubbing jobs to those who need work? She needs it. She?s a pain in the ass! No, I can?t... I take every offer I get. I do radio in the morning and dubbing at noon. At night, I do walk-ons. On Thursday, I play Moli?re for school kids... and if it?s a bit part in a movie, I say yes! The only way to succeed is to accept everything... to get maximum exposure and make new contacts. If you want to fire me, say so... Sacha Guitry is casting. I can run right over. Have you anyone in mind? Yes, I?ve got two men: Raoul Coquet and Fernand Coustal. Remember them? Coquet sounds good. I?ll call him. I?m not so sure of Coustal. I?ll put a question mark on his name. Is that her? Yes... That?s her. Still a beauty! Why "still"? "The Sin" dates back to my Communion. You saw the film? How come? I didn?t see it, but I swiped all the stills... including the famous one! She really is beautiful... but she?s strange... I can?t figure her out. Let?s make the phone call! Lucas, I?ve got bad news for you. The Germans banned the play? No... You can?t leave next week. The escape route fell through. You said it was a sure thing. It?s never sure. The passer who guides people through Nevers was arrested. I?ve got another lead, but it?s risky. You?re afraid he?ll get caught too? No, worse than that... Some passers... so-called passers... after taking your money... drive you straight up to the Kommandantur. So they get paid off on both ends... You?re a special case: some people may recognize you, or spot your accent. Let?s stay put for a while. Will you be able to hold out? Of course I will... I must! But l hate to feel so useless... so trapped. Did you talk to Jean-Loup? Will he help us? Frankly, I?d rather keep him out of it... He knows too many people. He gossips, he fools around... it?s too dangerous! D?you know how many letters about Jews are mailed to the police? Guess! I don?t know... 300? 1 500! 1 500 letters daily! "My boss is Jewish,... my neighbour is a Jew..." No. They all think you?re gone... Let?s keep it that way. I?ll take care of you. Did you think I was being polite? Well, you?re wrong: I want to look at your legs! Wait, let me breathe in the smell of the stage. From the cellar, I follow all that goes on: when the lights are dimmed in the morning, I know it?s rehearsal time. When they go on again, it?s lunch time. When all the lights go out at night, it means... you?re on your way down. It reminds me of a play I saw in London 3 years ago: at night, the husband would pretend... to go out, but as soon as the gaslight grew dim... we knew it meant he?d come back and was up in the attic. Do you remember that play? I almost acquired the rights. He liked the Grand Guignol... but he?s very happy to be with us. He?s a little like Jean Gabin in "The Human Beast": very physical... and yet quite gentle. He says it?s because of you that he?s an actor. No, I?ll do it myself. Tell me how rehearsals are going. Jean-Loup is doing well. l was delighted today when he blew his top! Yes, just a minute. Jean-Loup, it?s Daxiat. What does he want? I don?t know. Hello, Daxiat. What?s up? I heard it yesterday, in the last metro. They may stop rehearsals of "The Dead Queen". Why? Is Montherlant a Jew? You?re pretty warm... Daxiat wants to expose the Jews who still work at the Com?die Fran?aise. He claims Jean Yonnel is a Rumanian Jew. I don?t know if Yonnel is Jewish, or half-Jewish... but I know he should have run away... far away from these maniacs. They?re really crazy... all madmen. Not only in Germany, but here: Daxiat and the others... Madmen! You wanted to know what Bernard Granger looked like. He?s just perfect. At least we don?t have to worry: he looks like a real goy! What have you got against goyim? Nothing against... those with short skirts and long hair. You dirty racist! My mother warned me I?d never be happy with a Jew. "You know, Carl... if you wish to remain in this house... you must never pronounce the name of Charles-Henri. Everyone noticed my new dress last night... except for you..." That?s very good, Nadine... but I want you to move over to Bernard. We?ll give you a lamp. You?ll put it on the table... it will help... Raymond, stop fooling around... Go get us a lamp. Let?s go on. "Don?t tell me it?s your work." "I know you work... more than I do... but some people in this house... should keep... their own duties in mind." "Why do you say that?" Because... it?s in the script! Yes, it?s Daxiat. Go over and say hello. Be friendly. Remember he helped us get the Censor?s visa. Don?t worry. I?ll thank him. Alright, kids. Let?s take a break. Who?s he? Don?t you know him: he?s the lnspector-General... Daxiat, the drama critic. Is that Daxiat? I had no idea... I?d love to meet him... You?re not fussy! He practically runs the Com?die Fran?aise. This may sound strange, coming from me... but I think your husband... was wrong to leave France. The new anti-Israelite laws... apply to theatre speculators and profiteers. But your husband was a rare pearl: the only Israelite theatre director... You can say Jewish! He was at once a brilliant executive... a talented stage director and an artist. You see, the Germans are deeply attached to culture. They don?t want talented artists to leave France. But there?s no need to worry about your play. I?m certain Cottins can handle the job. Still, one wonders why this play was chosen... Even Pitoeff turned it down! D?you know Mrs Fabre? She wants to ask you for a favor. Yes, of course. I know Madame. It?s about my son, Pierre. What?s he doing here? He likes to sniff around at rehearsals... when he?s interested in a play. Will he write about us? He will, or he won?t. I wish he?d forget us. Just stay here. Look... We?re all Catholics in our family... Here?s the proof... Fine... I?ll do my best... Come and meet our little circle. Nadine Marsac, the top student of the Simon drama course... Well? He?s going to help me. Bernard Granger... our leading man... straight out of the Grand Guignol, as you see. He plays Carl? Yes... Strange... he?d be ideal as "The Hairy Ape". Raymond will show you the way out. He doesn?t go for girls, does he? Is it okay to ask you a question? Look at this. What do you call it? A fishing rod. But we also call it a gaulle. Now, if we add a second one to it... we get "Deux Gaulle"! Bravo, Raymond... You?re very witty! I speak to you from the plant of a journal... that proclaims the truth! I say the French theatre must drive its Jews out... from the rafters to the prompter?s box! For a Jewish prompter at the "Menilmontant"... will worm his way to the high command of the Opera! We must oust the Jew from the stage and the wings... and keep him out! No Jew should be allowed in a key position in theatre... for his sordid practices are bound to corrupt it! Let these "gentlemen" be warned... that France is off-limits to Jews. Only in this way can true Frenchmen safeguard their nation! Here?s the money you asked for, Mrs Steiner. But I can?t raise this amount every month. Of course not. This is exceptional. In that case, there?s no problem. Hello, Mr Merlin... Come in. Marion, this is Rosette. Put your samples on the desk and run along home. How old are you? I?ll be fourteen in 3 months. You?re working... don?t you go to school? No, I don?t want to anymore. D?you like the theatre? Yes. Come see our play. She can?t come to the theatre: the kid can?t go out at night! Yes, I can! 3 months ago, I went to hear Edith Piaf at the ABC Theatre. I wore my scarf down to here... so nobody could see it. There was no trouble. We?ll talk about it some other time. Go home. It?s late. I?m surprised at you, Marion! Now, that child will insist on seeing the play... Her parents hate to deny her anything, but they?ll blame me. Forgive me, I?m sorry. I was sympathetic because... Are they French? The girl is, but her parents are Polish. The father?s a tailor. He works at home... in an attic. He can?t go out in the street... on account of his thick accent. Like Lucas? His is much worse... Besides, he hardly speaks French... lf a German asks him for directions, he?d be trapped! So he hides in his attic and his wife manages for him. Isn?t he scared of a denunciation? Can?t they go to the Free zone? They?d love to go... but it costs a fortune and they?re poor. Got a date tonight? Not really... I?m going home. Let?s have dinner. I?m sorry, I can?t. You can?t spend every night by yourself. I?ve got to go home. I?ve read them all, Mrs Director. Nothing of interest. You can return them... but first, make sure to burn the reader?s notes... they?re in my handwriting. I?ll take care of it. Let me explain about the money: I divided it in three wads. The first is for the conveyor who?ll take you to Vierzon. They call them conveyors? Yes, conveyors. He?s to be paid before he drives off. You?ll be comfortable. It?s a furniture moving van. I?ll sit in an armchair, like a minister! Listen, Lucas. This is serious. This wad is for the farmer who?ll take you across the borderline. His property is so big that it extends over both zones. At the furthest end, you?re in the Free zone. Let me guess: the third wad is for Spain. For Spain and for the rest. And in case you need more, I brought this. No Mrs! Not the jewelry. Not ? the ? jewelry! You may need it. So will you. Bring it along when you join me... I want you to join me... as soon as possible. To be safe, I?ve got to play the first 100 performances. Good God! What confidence! D?you think it will run till then? That?s 6 months... No, I want you to leave after the 50th... no later! I?ll tell them I?ve got a spot on my lungs... and to find another actress. I?ll turn the management over to Jean-Loup... and pretend I?m going to a sanitarium. Then, I?ll join you... And we?ll start from scratch. I?m not a barber... stop fidgeting. Don?t. It?s horrible! I?m trying to feel Jewish. It?s very hard to portray a Jew. If you underplay, they?re skeptical. If you overplay, they say: "He doesn?t look Jewish." What does it mean "to look Jewish"? Why ask me? Don?t move around. Listen, Marion... I love that song. How could I resist his romancing... or forget his manly embrace? My heart still believes... all the sweet lies... and the tender look in his eyes. I, who loved him so... the most wonderful man of St. Jean. He broke my heart... didn?t say goodbye... or tell me why. He broke my heart... didn?t say goodbye... or tell me why. - How?s the garden? - Okay. - Growing? - Yeah. Then, we can smoke! Jacquot, come here. Listen. Can you recite? - Sure. - Ready? Try to say: "?Mother, do you think Mr Carl will return?" "Mother, do you think Mr Carl will return?" Very good. Now say: "I like to study with him." "I like to study with him." That?s fine! Hello! "Mother, do you think Mr Carl will return?" What are you talking about? "I like to study with him." - What is this? - It?s him. - Who? - Him! - It?s OK now! - Good. Nadine, are you ready? You can come in. "Shall I prepare Eric?s room now?" "Please do. Don?t forget the salve for his hand." "I?m through, Mother." "Fine. Go to bed now." Now, you walk to the stairway... You stop on the second step. Don?t fall! Now you say your line. "Mother, will Mr Carl return?" "What do you think, son?" "He?ll come back. I like to study with him." That?s fine, Jacquot. Bravo! At least, we?ve got one good actor in our play. That?s nice. Thanks a lot! See you tomorrow. Do I get a kiss too? You get a handshake! Since you insist... please, allow me... I?ll read your palm: there are two women in you... Sorry, but neither one wants to sleep with you! So long! It?s my own fault... I was too obvious... too aggressive. Now, she enjoys needling me! When her job?s over, she?ll just vanish. I?ve got to score with her before opening night! D?you have my size in tan? D?you have my size in tan? What?s this? Stop bothering Mrs Steiner! She?s no bother, Raymond. It?s alright. I?ll get you a size 7. Don?t you need stockings? Sure, but I can?t afford them. Are you kidding? Not at all... I use make-up. So do I. You even drew the seams. How chic! To do it right, one needs a helping hand. GERMAN TROOPS INVADE FREE ZONE Is that today?s paper? Did you know about it? I heard it on the radio. People from the Free zone will be happy... They invaded the Free zone? So what? I?ll have to sneak across all of France instead of just half. No, the Germans are everywhere. They search all the trucks. The passer refuses to risk it... It?s much too dangerous now. What am I supposed to do? Wait till things simmer down. I can?t stay here. I?ll go crazy! This is no life. D?you know how I kill time all day? I read... I read a lot... I listen to lies on the radio. Then I read lies in the press. To keep from losing my mind... I do crossword puzzles. You want to see them? Just listen: across, in 5 letters... symbol of infamy: "kikes". Down, in 8 letters... stinking vultures: "sheenies". These are for the kiddies: "You can never trust one"... in 3 letters: the first letter is a J... So l give up, I listen to the sounds in the theatre... I wait for your footsteps on the stairs. I wait and wait. I can?t wait anymore! How many years can a man live? I can?t take it anymore... Please, Lucas... I?m going! Where? Away from here. I?ll speak to them! To whom? The authorities... the police... I?ll regularize... my status. I?ll register. Are you crazy? Stay here! What do you want? A concentration camp? Let me go! You?re not leaving... I won?t let you! Here, it?s real cognac... from the black market. You?re shaking... You?d better take a drink. I just realized something awful: I could kill a man... We?ll fix up the cellar. We?ll get a real bed... a comfortable armchair and some rugs. I need a desk. You?ll have a real apartment. I hope you won?t forget the wallpaper. Mrs Steiner wants a rifle for the gamewarden. We need an official permit for a prop rifle... It?s not so easy! It?s what she wants. I can?t go out that way. They?re here. We should have gotten up earlier. - Use the back yard. - Right. - Marion... - Yes? Don?t forget to lock the door. They sent him to another stalag... but he can?t tell me where it is... I mail them separately; one of them might reach him. They fit me. I?m the same size as your husband. He wasn?t my husband, he was my number two. I got them at the Colonial Exposition... for cash, of course. At times, he was fun... but what a bastard! Hello, Bernard. I bet you slept out: you haven?t shaved. Yes, I spent the night out: I ran into a raid for "Voluntary Labor in Germany". Two guys were checking everybody. So l turn this way and that way... Each guy thought the other had checked me out! It?s nothing to brag about: that?s why our prisoners can?t come home. How come you?re dressing up here? Don?t broadcast it. Yes, I spent the night out. I hate for a man to touch me. Can?t you do this instead of him? You want to know how I feel about it? Maybe I can?t stand touching a man! Don?t forget my other costume. What other costume? It?s written in the script: Act 2: "Carl enters, wearing a frown." I?d suggest something sober! You know Granger? The new actor? Yes. Tell him I couldn?t wait. Say Christian left this. I?ll give it to him. Marion... are you there? Where are you? Go over to the bed and say something. Say what? I?m by the bed. I can?t hear. Same here. I hardly hear you. Go over to the radio. Where is the radio? I don?t see it. It?s next to the boiler. The boiler? Here I am. Is it this hole? Yes. I hear you as if you were by my side. Turn the sound on loud and come up to the stage. This is very dangerous. It?s not... It?s great! I rigged up the old heating vent. With this set-up... I can hear all the rehearsals from the cellar. At night, I can give you suggestions to pass on to Jean-Loup... Now, "Disappearance" is sure to be a hit... it could run for a year! I?m back in business: I?m directing again... but strictly incognito! "Since I came here, I?ve heard nothing but lies... lies and contradictions." "They?re not lies, but blanks. They?re not lies, but blanks. For years, I tried to find out the truth. It?s dreadful not to know who one is... what one has done. Even worse is the fear it may occur again. At times, I feel as if I don?t really exist." "Why won?t Dr Sanders allow you to consult a doctor?" "He knows more than any doctor. Without him, I?d be dead. I?ll be eternally grateful to him." "A prisoner owes no gratitude to her jailer... and Dr Sanders has imprisoned you. But if a man tells you he loves you... why won?t you listen ?" No... wait a minute. Is it really necessary to shout all these lines? I don?t know... it sounds all wrong to me. Lucas? notes are explicit: this scene is to be played like a duel. Like a duel! Alright, but it seems absurd to me. "A prisoner owes no gratitude to her jailer... and Dr Sanders has imprisoned you. But if a man tells you he loves you... why won?t you listen?" "I have no right to love... no right to love, or be loved." You are simply voicing Dr Sander?s words. "I will tell you something about Dr Sanders." There... You told me to shout, so I did. But I?m not happy about it. I?m not happy either. You see, we?re not happy. Granger?s right. The scene should not be shouted. But that?s what you asked for! So I made a mistake... Jean-Loup shouldn?t take my notes so literally. What?s that? An electricity failure. Get a candle. A candle... It?s on again. It shouldn?t be played as a duel, but as a conspiracy. Am I boring you? Sorry, I?m simply exhausted. Then sleep here... No, I want to sleep at the hotel... I?ll go home. So, you?re deserting the conjugal cave? Goodnight. Wait... wait. I?m waiting. I?ll see you tomorrow morning. Raymond! Raymond! Did you see him? No. Are you the electrician? No, not the electrician: the engineer. Here he is! I know l?m late. While I stood in line at the hardware store... someone swipes my bike. So I take the subway... It breaks down: we?re stuck between two stations... As always. Why not take a bike-cab? We?d have paid for it. For his size, they charge double! That?s why I don?t take them! I?ve got my self-respect! I was just kidding. Can you see me spread out like a pasha... being hauled around by a poor bastard on his bike? Sure, I know: fat men are funny... good-natured clowns. Well, I?m not a nice fat man... I?m a nasty one... Go to hell! Listen, last year they stole my bike too... so I kissed it off. But 3 days later, in another street... unbelievable! What do I see? My very own bike... No. 813-HK-45. So I figure I?ll take it back. Just then, a creep walks up... real cool... I let him unfasten the lock. Then I say: "Look man, this is my bicycle!" The creep acts indignant. We swap insults... People gather around to watch the fight. You know what he pulls? He calls me a fairy. No offense, Jean-Loup. He claims I?m molesting him... making indecent proposals... the works! The people give me dirty looks. They all side with the crook! A real lynch mob! So I beat it fast and never looked back! There are the Boches, the Heinies... the Krauts, the Jerries... I don?t remember the other one... You forgot the buzzards... That?s right... the buzzards. Say, that?s my record-player! It?s not yours, it?s Marion?s. She lent it to me for a party. They swipe all my props: when it?s not an armchair, it?s a record-player. A gentleman is waiting for you. I wonder who it is. I don?t know his name. He writes in "Je Suis Partout". Daxiat? Yes, it?s Mr Daxiat. May I speak with you? I wanted to meet you outside the theatre... because it?s a confidential matter. I know you don?t like me... but I daresay it?s perhaps because... you don?t know me. I?m not judging you... but your articles have often hurt friends... whose work I admire. Others say you love the theatre. I just don?t know. Indeed, I am a paradox: I adore the theatre, I live for it and yet, I?m hated by most theatre people. It requires strength of character to cope with such hostility. I daresay I?ve got that strength. I?ve always admired Lucas Steiner... If he was here, I would tell him our real struggle is socialistic... anti-capitalistic... that we too, are men of the Left... but we go further: we want revolution! You know, Lucas... read newspapers, but only the theatre section. I do the same. But politics... You?re wrong: everything is political! But that?s not what I?m here for... Lucas Steiner is still in France. We?re sorry... It?s stupid, but obligatory: everybody down to the shelter! That identity card was found on a passer who was arrested. Your husband must be hiding out in some village... but at some point, he?s bound to contact you. Would you give him a message: if he comes back, I won?t write anything against him. It?s a matter of honor. But if he returns, you?ll be compromised. And what about your theatre? The name of Steiner can only harm you. You ought to get a divorce. Do you remember, Marion? Remember what? The elevator of that department store. Yes, I remember... I felt they all knew what we were doing... I was terrified... Only terrified? No, not only terrified... But the night of that premiere... There, you were scared... No, I enjoyed it... Go on... go home... Go back to the hotel. I?d rather you left right now. What if I stay here tonight? All night? Till tomorrow? All night. Till tomorrow! You mean it? I?ll put out the light to consider your proposition. "But if I tell you I love you... Why won?t you listen?" I know it?s in the script, but l?d rather you refrained during rehearsals. Save it for the perfomance! Let?s go on. "I have no right to love... no right to love, or be loved." "But if I tell you I love you... why won?t you listen?" Bernard, you?re supposed to... caress her face just then. Marion told him not to touch her. A large crowd is gathered here, I?m trying to make my way through... What was that? I?m told that blast is due to... an explosive device in a record-player! Admiral Froelich has been seriously injured. They tell me he was killed! The ambush was set up by some terrorists... A record-player exploded. Excuse me, Mrs Steiner. I?m busy, Mr Merlin. Please: this is important. I know who he is... You shouldn?t sell your jewelry. Let me take it to a pawn shop. If the play?s a hit, you can get it back. It makes sense. Thank you, Mr Merlin. I?m sorry, but I need some time... to think it over. As you wish. Would you help me rehearse in my dressing room? The kind of help you want can be picked up in a brothel. I can rehearse you. Never mind. I?ll manage. "Carl, if you wish to remain in this house... you must never mention the name of Charles-Henri." It?s at the perfume counter of the Galeries. Ask for Miss Yolande. She?ll let you have "Gone With the Wind" for 80 Frs. I wouldn?t spend that much on a black market book... but if Marion wants it... Yes, she does. Then, I?ll get it. Would you help me rehearse in my dressing room? I?ve never done it. It?s simple: you just read the text. I say a line and you answer me. Alright. It?s a nice room! Yes, it is. Essentially, they?re profiteers. Very few come here to work. The problem is that there?s no way for most Frenchmen... to recognize a Jew. Ilf we could spot them, we could protect ourselves. Some have typical racial features, but not all of them! If only all Jews had blue skin, but as it is... we need a foolproof way to detect them... They say: "It?s better to hear that than to be deaf," but at times, I?d rather be stone-deaf! How was our rehearsal? Great... I mean it was much better... The whispering improves the scene... but you could add to the intimacy by dimming the lights. The faces could be illuminated from the rear... as silhouettes. Don?t move... Remember, you?re silhouettes! Raymond... if you don?t mind! You?re a genius, Jean-Loup. I?ll shift the backdrop to sharpen the silhouettes. What the hell, Raymond? We?re in the dark! l know! The whole area?s in the dark! A light failure. Perfect for a shadow play! The whole neighbourhood?s blacked out. You?d think they?d warn us. Marc, let?s get some lamps. I know where we can get candles... for cash, of course! Nadine, we?re waiting for you. Let me explain. No need to. Don?t judge me. I?m not judging you... but try to keep your love life outside the theatre. Marion?s heartless. She?s too tough... She?s not interested in anyone. She has no sympathy for anyone. She doesn?t know I?m alive. She?s worse since Lucas? gone. I can?t stand it! Calm down, child... calm down... It?s not the end of the world. She opened a door that should have been locked. You see it as a tragedy, but... in two weeks, it will have been forgotten. I hope you?re right. I want to go home. Run along. Can I help? No, drop it. You?re the last thing she needs. She?ll be alright. I hate to see her so upset. Christ! I really was on the wrong track with her. That?s for sure! She?s no playmate for you... she?s more like a competitor. Were you really stuck on her? I just wanted to sleep with her... it was like a craving for a warm croissant! I wanted to warn you to drop her, but I figured... it was none of my business. You?re all going to the Joconde tonight? lt?s a cabaret. You know what the BBC says? They say all those... who go to night clubs will be held to account after the war. Jean-Loup wants to boost our morale. You... you had the right to be moody... to throw a party, or be by yourself. Why am I expected to be charming and smiling at all time? Even Jean-Loup picks on me. He?s right. And he doesn?t know half of it! I don?t mind that you neglect me... but for the others, the play comes first. You must pay more attention to them. Why don?t you answer? I?d rather not. The coffee?s ready. I?ve got to run. Marion! Yes? I heard you and Bernard rehearsing the love scene. So what? It seems to me... I feel... it might be improved. What do you mean? It?s the only love scene in the play. Try to be... more sincere... No, this seat?s for Bernard. I can?t stay. I?ve got to meet the producer of "Angels of Mercy". I?m not sure... it?s between me and two other girls. I hope you get the role. We?ll pray for you. I?m off. She?ll be good... but they may feel she?s too young. She?d be better in "School for Wives". Nadine in the role of Agn?s? When she announces: "The little kitten is dead..." the whole audience will think: "She?s the one who killed it!" Enjoying yourselves? Sit here! Well, I?m not alone. I brought a friend. Simone... Sit down. Take care of her while I check our things. Arlette, sit next to me. Just a minute. Give those back. I?ve changed my mind. Sorry, Mrs Steiner. I can?t stay. Come on, let?s go. I forgot... I?ve got a date. You?re free. We?re all free. I apologize. I?ll see you tomorrow. That man?s staring at us. Don?t look. He?s coming over. Hello, Cottins. Still in show business... a real trooper! Introduce me. I forget your name. Ren? Bernardini. Bernardini... Arlette Guillaume... Marion Steiner. I?ll be right back. You promise! This joint is tacky. Let?s go to the Monseigneur. No, Marion?s exhausted. Speak for yourself. I feel like going there! Wait for Arlette. No, you two are kill-joys. I?m not sleepy. It?s sinister here. Let?s go. What?s up? Tonight, I?m on my own. What?s going on? That?s Marion: the party fizzles, so she opts for an all-night disaster. I see Daxiat has two seats... I see Daxiat has two seats... in the 7th row. Remember: 20 seats for the Propagandastaffel! Why look at me that way? It?s mandatory: 20 seats every night. It?s a rule. At the Odeon, they put them in the side boxes. We?ll do the same! It?s too much! We give good seats to those who pan us... and we turn down genuine fans. Lucas would say: "We give our best seats to our enemies." My purse was in my dressing room. It?s missing. Oh, great! What a mess! Somebody searched this room. Well? They took my travel clock. I think that?s all they swiped. And you? They left my wallet, but it?s empty. It?s worse for you. I don?t mind the money, but my ration cards, my I. D. card, my work permit and my pass were in my purse. I?m glad I locked your door, Marion. I?ll get the police. No, we?ll do the searching. Just like at Radio-Paris: some "moving men" came for the piano. They never returned it. They were moving men like I am! That?s fine, but I need my papers. I wonder who did it. Well, I know who did it... I?m almost sure of it. Raymond, you know who I mean. I guess you don?t agree... Yes, I do! It could only be her. I guessed it at once... Martine... Raymond, you know where she lives. Run over there... No, I don?t know! Come on, she?s your sweetie! She?s not: she turned me down. She peddles her black market stuff around theatres. That?s how we met. I took her out once. That?s all. I don?t even know her address. I?ve never been to her place... but she?s a looker... I let people think we slept together. Let?s call the police. I don?t want the police to seet foot in this theatre. This way, please... This way, please... Clear the aisle. Thank you. Any seats tonight? No, it?s opening night. That?s Marion Steiner. Where is Mrs Steiner?s office? It?s on the landing. Her dressing room is there. No. Leave the flowers here. They?ll poison the air in there. I hear them, Marion. I don?t see how you can eat. I couldn?t. Sure you can. Here. No, I swear I can?t. What if tonight?s a disaster? We?ll do a new play. With what money? Have you seen our accounts? I have. If it?s a flop, we lose the theatre. I?m terrified. How can you be so calm? Lucas, you picked the play, you staged it... we followed your advice. It?s your creation. If it doesn?t work... if it doesn?t work... I?m to blame, it?s my fault... my own fault... but we?ll all be up shit creek! Have a drink. I don?t know how you do it... I feel faint... I?m sick to my stomach. Just relax... Wait, put this over your stomach... sit down. Thanks. I must go now. We?ll talk later. Sure. So long. I should be reassuring you. There?s no need to. I feel gay as a lark. "Isn?t Eric here?" "He was restless this morning. He?s probably at the gate, watching the road." "Dr Sanders wouldn?t allow him to go to the station." "My godfather knows best. I suppose he wanted to speak to the new tutor in private. But if I?d been consulted, I?d say... Eric has no need for a tutor. He?s too young and I enjoy teaching him the little I know." "You are right, Mrs... but this big house is too quiet for Eric. My mother says that when she worked here... she often served 20 dinner guests." There are 25 of us in Paris: we?re "public utilities". "On my birthday... when Dr Sanders told me I could eat with the grown-ups... I cried." How come she?s going in? My son is acting in this play! "Shall I prepare Eric?s room now?" You alright? As the boss used to say: "When you gotta go, you gotta go!" "Tell Eric to finish his homework." "This is Mr Carl, our new tutor. I should have warned you... The resemblance is striking... It?s truly amazing!" "l don?t know what you mean. But I expected an older man." "I?m an experienced teacher." "I don?t doubt it. But so far, my son has been raised solely by us. I had hoped he might be guided by someone who... Still, since my godfather trusts you... Eric, meet your new tutor." "Helena, be wary of your faulty memory. Here are his credentials. I showed them to you a month ago." What a bastard! "You?re surely right, I was confused..." "Certainly by the resemblance." "Every new face upsets me... But I?ll get used to him. Besides... Eric seems happy." "Can I take Mr Carl around the estate?" "Of course, child." "Listen, Gregory." "When will you learn to trust me? Don?t you realize how I cherish you? Besides..." "l don?t want to lose you." Hurry up! Germaine, we?ve only got five minutes! Don?t turn around! How did it go? We?ll know when it?s over. Watch it... Easy... What?s going on? We?re 5 minutes late. Can?t we go in quietly? "I must tell you about Dr Sanders." "You?ve no right!" "I must tell you, Helena: Dr Sanders didn?t come back after Charles-Henri?s death, but before it." "Since I came here, I?ve heard nothing but lies... lies and contradictions." "They weren?t lies, but blanks. I?ve spent years trying to learn the truth. It?s terrifying not to know who I am, or what I did. Worse yet, is the fear that it may occur again. At times, I feel I don?t really exist." "But when I told you I love you... Why didn?t you listen?" I had no right to love, don?t you see? No right to love, or be loved." "And now?" "Now, I?m coming to love and it hurts. ls love painful?" "Yes, love is painful. Like a bird of prey, it hovers over us... as if to threaten us. But it is also a promise of happiness. You?re lovely, Helena... so lovely that it?s painful to look at you." "Yesterday, you said it was a joy." "It is a joy and it?s painful." We won! I?m sorry, but Marion?s exhausted. I?m sorry, but Marion?s exhausted. You understand... She?s got to rest. You can come in. Send her a note. She?ll appreciate it. I didn?t know you were here. Come in. My husband?s with me. So he is! Put them there. - You were wonderful. - Thanks. I knew the torn dress would be effective. Sorry, but they insist on it. Captain Wiedekind and his wife. My husband doesn?t speak French. Cheer up! You look grim. I?m not. Here?s to you. It went smoothly. Except for that louse, Daxiat. What are you brooding about? I?m not. I was thinking about the play. I enjoyed playing with you. I was really moved. You gave a great performance. I?ll do better in a few days. See that man over there? The one who?s by himself? Yes. Please get him out of here. Leave it to me. Remember me? Yes. You can?t stay here... This is a private gathering... A working session. She?s expecting me. She?s not expecting anyone. She?s exhausted... That way out! Did she get my flowers? Were those your roses? They were so full of thorns her hands were all bloody! If I were you, I?d go home real fast! So long! Thank you very much. You were excellent! Bravo, you were great! I was? Thanks. Looking for someone? No, never mind. Are you pleased? I?m happy for Marion. I don?t understand you. You heard the applause! It?s a hit! A hit... a hit... Maybe so, but it?s far from perfect. From down here, you can tell all the weak spots. I made notes. I?ll read them to you. Sit down. In the first place... Are you crazy? We can?t do that now. They?re waiting for me. I can?t stay. Come back later on. How can I? We?re all together up there. You know what it?s like... Then, spend the night here. That?s impossible. Be sensible. I?ll come down tomorrow morning. Then take my notes. Study them. Alright. Wait... look at me! Where can I put them? Keep them till tomorrow. Kiss me... Goodbye. Daxiat liked it. He?ll give us a rave... Here?s Marion! Where were you? Some champagne for Marion... I want the "Petit Parisien"... "Aujourd?hui", "La Gerbe"... ??Comedia?? and ??Je Suis Partout.?? Listen to Daxiat: "The Montmartre Theatre has changed its management, but not its spirit. Its new play is a hazy vignette." "Hazy!" Sure... he missed the beginning. "Colorless... and apolitical, it deliberately ignores our real problems." Naturally! "Mrs Steiner maintains... the tradition of Jewish nihilism... which has always polluted that theatre. The play says nothing about Jews. Yet, it reeks of Jewishness. As to the staging by Jean-Loup Cottins... it is merely an effeminate version of Lucas Steiner?s style." Hear, hear! "What can I say about Marion Steiner?s performance? It?s all-pathos, but unfit for the stage. Back to the movies, Mrs!" See? "The only revelation is Bernard Granger..." "He creates a totally convincing character. A star is born." At last! It?s not funny. No, but the other reviews are good. With the booking we?ve got, the play?s a winner. Thanks to you, Marion. Your film fans come to see you in the play. "...the Jewish nihilism which polluted that theatre." He signed it, but it reads like an anonymous letter! You?re right. Daxiat and company have the same poisonous motives. Before, they were nobodies... Now, they rule the country, but for how long? Look at this passage... It?s about you. Me? Yes... Look here... "Not content to monopolize our stage and screen... the Jews steal our most beautiful women." They sound cheerful. It?s a private party. The director of the "Hebertot" wants to meet you. Miss Bataille... Mr Daxiat... Bravo! Congratulations. You were fantastic! Your article was outrageous! Apologize to Mrs Steiner! Certainly not! You?ll apologize to the whole cast! I won?t fight. Let?s go outside. You?re insane! This is absurd! You?re ridiculous! Apologize to Mrs Steiner. Apologize! I won?t apologize for doing my job! I won?t fight! Yes, you will! I refuse to fight! I?m not a prize-fighter: I?m a journalist! You?re irresponsible! How could you do this to us? What about my theatre? What about our play? All you care about is your theatre! "How are the bookings?" "Will we do a matinee at Xmas?" Yes, the theatres are full now, but so are the jails! Listen, we?ll go on playing together. But offstage, don?t you dare speak to me! "You?re lovely... so lovely it?s painful to look at you." "You said it was a joy." "lt is a joy... yet it?s painful." Look at this... lt?s crazy! Now that the play?s working out... you can relax. Why look at me that way... At times, I feel you hate me. Not at all... I?d be crazy to hate you! You are a little crazy! I know you by heart. I know you too. For me, that play belongs to the past. I?ve got a new project: "The Magic Mountain"... with a great role for you. Are you listening? Yes. It?s about a cruel woman... Me... cruel? No, the character! She?s gentle, tender, in love, and yet... she?s cruel. She doesn?t mean to be... She?s cruel despite herself. Cruel! It?ll be wonderful! No literature! We?ll use everyday language. I?ll use your own words, you see? I see that from now on, everything I say may be held against me. Mr Daxiat? Over there. I was reluctant to come, but with you, one doesn?t know... whether it?s an appointment, or a summons. Apparently, you misread my review... Was that a review? I?d say it was a vicious attack. Assuming it was, it wasn?t aimed at you. On the contrary... Across all the columns... And don?t forget the exclamation mark. I went to the theatre expecting to see a play... directed by Jean-Loup Cottins. Instead, I saw a nondescript show... with no style. I felt you were merely a front... and worse yet... a mouth-piece for a fugitive. Normally, I?d answer in kind. But as it is, I?ll just go. Wait... I?ve got a proposition for you. Whatever it is, my answer is no! I want you to help me save the "Montmartre". Steiner turned it over to his wife before running away... I found out the transaction is illegal... because the transfer was ante-dated. This kind of transaction is labelled a "fictitious aryanization". Meaning what? It means that legally, the theatre doesn?t belong to anyone... and the Germans can requisition it. Unless... Unless what? Unless it is taken over by someone they approve of. Daxiat didn?t beat about the bush. He proposed that they share the management... He?d select the plays. Jean-Loup would direct. I assume Jean-Loup refused. No, he didn?t. He couldn?t. All he could do was to stall for time. The only way to fight Daxiat is to appeal to a higher-up like Dr Dietrich. But Jean-Loup refuses to do it. Dr Dietrich, please. On the first floor. You?ll have to wait. Dr Dietrich, please. That?s impossible. I called him. He?s expecting me. What?s your name? Marion Steiner. I see you?ve got a 5 p. m. appointment... but it?s impossible. I don?t mind waiting. I?m sorry. It?s useless to wait: Dr Dietrich left for the Eastern front. He was recalled for active duty. Then, that?s that. Mrs Steiner, I?d like a word with you. I?m an admirer of yours... I am Lieutenant Berger. About Dr Dietrich... He?s not on the Eastern front: he shot himself last night. It?s tragic... He admired you enormously... and so do I. It?s an honor to shake your hand. I must speak to you. I?m sorry, but it?s absolutely necessary. I?m leaving the theatre. But I?ll give you time to find another actor. I should have expected this. No, it?s not what you think... You can?t forgive my row with Daxiat... and I understand your reaction. But even if you won?t speak to me, we are a good acting-team. I love the play and I love my role. So it?s not that. There?s no need to justify yourself. I?m not even sure we?ll replace you... The theatre may soon be shut down. I suppose you got a better offer from Hebertot. No, it?s not for Hebertot or any other theatre. I?m temporarily giving up acting... to join the Resistance. "Helena, I wish to speak to Mr Carl in private." "If it?s about my son... I have the right to listen." Civil Defense! Cellar inspection! "Mr Carl, isn?t it unfair? As Eric?s mother, I have the right to know." "Frankly, Dr Sanders... this is embarrassing." "Never mind, Mr Carl. Helena, please do as I say." "Since you insist, I?ll leave." "This is what happened: last October, she went for a walk... and simply disappeared." It?s for the cellar. - The cellar? - Yes. Out of the question! "When she came back, she was unable... to tell us where she?d been." "Was she amnesic?" "I suppose so." Put them in a side box. Follow me. "You?re right... Helena?s dependency on me may seem peculiar. She behaves like a child. Her gratitude is excessive." "At times, she seems too humble." "Why she feels guilty, I don?t know. But whatever it is, it leads her... to seek the affection of her inferiors: Charles-Henri was bewildered by it. And then the tragedy occured." "What tragedy?" "I know Dr Sanders... came back before Charles-Henri?s death!" D?you know them? Civil Defense. No, they?re Gestapo men. I know one of them. Gestapo? - Will you help me? - Yes. But no questions! "Love is painful. Like a bird of prey, it hovers over us... as if to threaten us. But it is also a promise of happiness. You?re so lovely, Helena... that it?s painful to look at you." "You said it was a joy." "It is a joy and it?s painful." No curtain calls tonight. What?s up? It?s Civil Defense... to inspect the cellar. This is Bernard Granger. Bernard... my husband. Don?t just stand there! You?ve got to conceal all this and hide! Take us to the cellar! No... wait for Mrs Steiner. I?m going in. No, she?s not dressed. Let?s be gentlemanly. So I made a mistake! Be patient. I?ll be right out. I never go down there. It?s probably full of rats. Have you got the key? Watch your heads! Seems to me it?s not deep enough for a shelter. There?s about 8" between the ceiling and the yard. What?s this? We used it in "The Cherry Orchard". There?s only room for 40 people. In any case, it?s been condemned since 39. During air-raids, we use the subway. The local station is open all night. Can we use that staircase for firewood? There are so many air-raids now... nobody bothers to go down. Well, they cleared out... till the next time. This is a hell of a life! It?s a life... it?s my life. Can?t you find a better hiding place? I don?t want one. This is my place... and this is where I stay! My wife is beautiful, isn?t she? Let me ask you a question: she?s in love with you, but do you love her? "I?m coming to love and it hurts. I?m coming to love and it hurts. Is love painful?" "Yes, love is painful. Like birds of prey, it hovers over us... as if to threaten us. But it is a promise of happiness. You?re so lovely... that it?s painful to look at you." "You said it was a joy." "It is a joy and it?s painful." Bernard, may I ask you something? Were you going to leave without saying goodbye? Of course not... I was waiting for the rehearsal to end. Well, it?s over now. It was sad... I watched it. Well? He was good. It?s a lesson in humility: we?re all expendable. Well, goodbye Bernard... I felt you were interested in all women... except for me. First, it?s not all women... and you intimidated me. You seemed to disapprove of me. At times, you were downright hostile. Hostile? Yes, I felt you were judging me. It?s just the opposite! I was so attracted to you... that I covered up so nobody would notice... and I made you hate me. That?s not true. I never hated you. But why did you act so distant after you?d kissed me? All actors kiss each other. But not on the mouth! I kissed you on the mouth? Yes... on opening night. I couldn?t have! You kissed me on the mouth! I know: you see two women in me. I do: I see two women in you: one who no longer loves her husband... No, don?t... You wouldn?t understand. Don?t forget your make-up. I won?t need it. I?ll leave it for my successor. I won?t be using any make-up. But you may need a disguise. Forgive me... And so, Lucien Ballard took over the part of Carl. Nadine Marsac, now famous, rushes off right after her final lines. A chauffeur drives her to the studios... where they?re shooting "Angels of Mercy" at night. Arlette Guillaume is the art director of the film. In June 1944, the Allies land in Normandy. Despite the daily hardships... Parisians keep on crowding the theatres. One night... ignoring the sirens... the audience stood outside... to watch the ballet of the RAF planes in the sky. Many theatres are shut down for lack of electricity. Thanks to Raymond?s ingenuity, the "Montmartre" remains open. He?s replaced the footlights by auto headlights Germany?s defeat is now inevitable. After 813 days and nights in his dark cellar... Lucas Steiner is impatient to see daylight. The street... is a scene of confusion and sporadic shooting. No... Not there! It?s a hectic period for Jean-Loup. Arrested by the F.F.I., he is released thanks to his connections... but re-arrested the next day because of his connections. As for Daxiat, he is a man on the run. The one-time press lord is now a pariah. He?s survived the bombing of Hamburg. After following Petain to Germany... he reaches Spain via a series of monasteries. Sentenced to death in absentia, he will die of a cancer in the ?60?s. But let us go back to the summer of 1944... and to our story. I tried to forget you. I couldn?t. If not for your pride, I?d have come sooner. You?d have had to make up a lie each time you came. Why should I lie? And to whom? He?s dead now. But you?ve got your career... No. I realized I didn?t care about it anymore... I gave it all up. The only thing that matters to me... is to be with you, to get you out of here. We can start all over again. No we can?t. There was never anything... anything real... between us. I toyed with the idea... but I never really loved you. It was an abstract notion. You believed in it because I believed it myself. I never stopped thinking of you... not even for a day. I thought of you too... but less and less often. And now, I don?t know what you?re doing here. I?ve almost forgotten your name... I barely remember the way you look. Go away! Listen to me. Listen carefully. It takes two to love... as it takes two to hate. And I?ll go on loving you. You make my heart beat faster. Nothing else matters to me. Goodbye. There?s Steiner! He?s back!
