The fucking Chevron refinery, you see the flames? The Chevron refinery just blew up. 2: Once a-fucking-gain, once again. : An important civil emergency message follows. There is an emergency at Chevron Refinery. Residents in Richmond are advised to shelter in place. Go inside, close windows and doors, turn off heaters, air conditioners and fans. Stay off the telephone unlessyou have a life threatening emergency. 1: It is going down. 2: The refinery just blew up, dog. 3: Yeah, we gotta leave this shit. 4: The Chevron burnin'. : A big fire at one of the country's largest oil refineries shot giant clouds of thick smoke into the air in Richmond, California. Fifteen thousand residents went to local hospitals complaining of health problems. 1: Follow the smoke. 2: It's chemicals from Chevron. 1: This is what happens when you live in Richmond. : The city also claims the stigma from the Chevron fire will affect property values and quality of life. : Okay, you guys, let's do it. I know, I know. I'm doing it, I'm doing it. I'm just putting his green thing on. Where's the pacifier? Here you go, here you go. -Do you remember? -Bye, love you. Love you, too. Hit your head? Did it hurt? I don't see no blood. You got extremely low income people. You've got crime, violence... a lot of economic desperation, you know. You can't be in a neighborhood like this talking 'bout let's save the polar bears. They're not, they're not gonna feel you. : Right over there that's the refinery... belching out pollution. The pollution based economy createda lot of haves and have nots. If you've been in Richmond, and you drive on that bridge overto Marin county, it's mind blowing, like, "What is this?" You know? They're hiding it just over the horizon. There was organic food, solar panels, an economy being built up around health, wellness and environment. I said, "This is not just going to be good for the earth, this is going to be investment opportunities, business opportunities, jobs..." We could have a green economy strong enough to lift people out of poverty. And I said, "This is what I'm going to dedicate my life to." -Hello. -Hi. The question is who can ry the country for a green outcome for everybody? Green For . That's our job. : That began this incredible coalition, Green For . We tried to get the greenest solutions to the poorest people. I said if we can have green jobs, we can solve the economic problem, the ecological problem... We said, "We need something concrete, where people can actuy see ordinary folks been trained to do extraordinary things." We're litery in the shadow of the Chevron refinery. And so you have the last century's pollution based economy, and then you also have the next thing. And Michele is the master of training people how to do this rk. In Richmond, the only time you ever saw Richmond on the news was t things, somebody's bleeding or something's burning, right? If the refinery has a fire, we get on the news. And if somebody gets shot, we get on the news. I t to create some good news in Richmond. I figured that solar is one great antidote to pollution, and jobs are a good antidote to violence. And that's what inspired me to start Solar Richmond. Green jobs are a possible solutionfor cities around the country because we're creating job opportunities. And at the same time, they're playing a part in this global movement to clean up the planet. This is a growth chart of the solar field. So it's been growing at about 50% a year. For me what that says is opportunity. There's money in this field, right? Since I've been laid off, that's I do is cook 'cause the wife expects it. Right, honey? She said "Okay." I try to put the house in the best situation it can be to keep the conflict down. I try to aid the conflict. You know, I know she's going to be frustrated at times. It's usuy at the end of the month, when the bills are due. She's a great . She's been taking care of me. And I think it's time for meto start taking care of her again. So it uld be cool to get solar panels, huh? Yeah. : I rey uld like that. It'll bring the cost down 70 bucks a month. With that 70 bucks we could go out maybe one more time or t more times a month to dinner. Or pay a bill. Sorry. Be practical. : A couple of... Ten years maybe? : No, more than that we've been together. : Ten years... it's a long time, but we dated longer than most people date. Who knows why, we just did. We're married for seven years? No, we're married 11 years. Eleven years right. So we've been together 13 before that, so we've been together 24-25 years. We're kinda like the old school, you know, you get married, you get married for life. If you have problems you rk through 'em, that kind of thing. Yeah, you try to rk through 'em. We're still underwater. We bought our house, and now it's rth less than f of what we paid for it. Foreclosure. Where you see that at? When it's foreclosed, they have those... usuy papers on the door saying the bank takeover. : Some of our other neighbors lost their home. We had neighbors come to our door, who were very upset but ted to let usknow they'd be moving. We're at the point ndering,"Okay, who else is going to be going and will it be us? Even though we're less than 5% of the rld's population, we're using more than 27% of its energy. Over f the electricity in the United States comes from coal. Coal is the biggest source of carbon that goes into the atmosphere. One hundred cars of coal powers a fossil fuel burning power plant for one day. One hour of sunlight hitting the earth is equal to the energy that every person on the planet consumes in a whole year. There's no shortage of solar energy. : We're one of the biggest residentialsolar companies in the country. We have 280 employees directly. We employ another 300 contractorsaround the country doing instations. The cost of Solar has dropped precipitously in the last five years by about 80%. We're starting to get to a point where clean energy will just compete without subsidies, so as we swap out and rewire the rld, we'll increasingly choose solar electricity because it is cheaper. Globy, we'll be majority solar powered by 2030. Who's going to lead that? Who's going to benefit from that? Where will those jobs be? : In my village, there was no electricity. In our house, we used kerosene and candles. I was seven years old whenelectricity bring to our village. Once they first see the electricity light, people think this is magic. In 2003, I started my own solar business. For solar, there is great opportunityfor growth in the market. At Westech, we set up the researching and ufacture. : When I started my business, I had only 15 people. Now I have 15,000 rldwide. We grow 50 percent every year. Okay, thank you. We see teamrk as one plus one equal eleven. My daughter, she come to my office. She said, "Hey Papa! You made a mistake! My teacher told me one plus one is t." I said, "Okay, one plus one is t is mathematics. One plus one is 11 is. This is economics." "Hello Elaine. Are you free now?" Yes. Elaine. Yes. Are you free now? My daughter, I will teach Green energy. Once she grows up, I hope she joins my business. A lot of people look at the clean tech relution that's going on in the rld and they look at China and they say, "Why is it that China has been able to pour of this money and be able to deploy so quickly?" It's actuy fear. Energy security is national security. If you have this much ded from people who t energy, you have to be able to supply that amount of energy, especiy for a country of 1.5 billion people. If you don't have enough oil, if you don't have enough coal or natural gas, where we're going to end up is with riots on the street. The only way to rey solve this problem, and not to create conflicts down the road with other countries, is renewable energy. China is a step ahead in thatthe Chinese government believes that the science of climate change is real. They believe that climate change is caused by . China is now the leading country in terms of how fast they are implementing sustainable technology at rey large scale. Today I believe that China now has industrial might. It has more ufacturing capacity for wind energy than any country in the rld. It has more ufacturing capacity for solar energy than any country in the rld. Renewable energy is the largest wealth creation opportunity of the 21st century, and the United States and China are in a huge battle to be the largest economic power. This rey is a race, the first one to deploy the most solar technologies at scale, wins. They get the most jobs, they get the most billionaire entrepreneurs and they become the most affordable place to do business. A thin PV crystal is like a thin piece of glass. It's actuy made out of the same stuff glass is, did you know that? -Silicon? -That's right. It's made out of silicon, only it's highly refined. They get it to what we c... : Men have at last harnessed the sunwith the Bell Solar Battery. Let the sun shine upon it, and you get an electric current. Solar is an American technology. The first commercialized solar panel was 1954, Bell Labs that was in real use, and that was through the space program. : The first solar cell that went uprked weeks, months, years... decades. It just kept going. And once that happened, solar became the power source for satellites. : The United States government continued to push solar forward during the space race. Kennedy's moonshot was so important to show the country that things that were formerly thoughtof as impossible, were actuy possible. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that chenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win. : Having that leadership, rying the country behind a common goal, and the government being able to make those investments in the technology, made getting to the Moon possible, and unleashed an era of technological adcement. When I hear the rd "environmentalist", I think of people going out and planting flowers everywhere who are gonna pick up bottles they see on the ground. In Richmond, you're not going to find any environmentalists. People have way more concerns. I rey never thought about none of these things until I got in this program. I went to college, but I didn't feel like it was for me. We was in class talking about Socrates. I didn't see anything long term. A bunch of minimum wage opportunities. If you don't go to college, you still can get a good job, but it's going to be a lot harder. It's going to be a lot harder. : My dad grew up in a place very muchlike Richmond, California. He grew up in the poorest part of Memphis and he grew up in abject poverty. He was able, though, to put himself through college. And then he put his little brother through college, and then he put me and my sisters through college. This is the biggest sock I've ever seen! Where'd you get these socks? He used to tell me the time that, "You've got to go through the internal disciplines of climbing that ladder out of poverty yourself, that's every individual's responsibility." My dad also said, society has a responsibility as well. Society has to make sure that every child has a ladder to climb. And that's what's wrong right now in places like Richmond. It used to be the case that if you didn'tgo to college, it was right. You could go get a blue collar job, we had ufacturing going on. Now, a lot of those jobs have left the country. And so you wind up in a situation where low income people have to try to climb a six story ladder out of poverty, but the ladder only has four rungs on it. So when you talk about green collar jobs, you're talking about putting some green rungs back in that ladder of opportunity. We pass the right policies, real people, are gonna have to get up in the morning, put on their rk boots, put on their green hardhats, get out there and do the rk. Environmental adcate Jones' new book, which makes its debut this weekon the New York Times best seller list is ced The Green Collar Economy. How one solution can fix our t biggest problems. Jones lays out a plan for a green economy, he says could help solve the nation's economic inequality. Seventy percent of global warming problems are in our cities. We can't beat global warming without greening the cities, and we can't green the cities without greening the ghetto. You are ground zero for our agenda, the only way we can save the polar bears is to save the neighborhood. This is BBC rld, and we were at the meeting this morning. Hey. Very good. : It uld be hard to imaginemy rk-life balance being any rse. If I get four hours of sleep, I'm doing great. But we're in the first minute of the first mile of a very long marathon here. You could put people to rk right now re-powering America with clean energy. That's what this movement is about. As a result of the fire at the Chevron Richmond Refinery, 15,000 people were treated at the hospital for respiratory related conditions. We are in a state of emergency. Why are we the city that leads the county in death and disease? People are still experiencing symptoms, some that may turn into very serious conditions like cancer or heart conditions. The day after the fire, Chevron raises the price on gas, and the people of this town are paying for their fire and I think they made, how much, three billion in the last quarter? And the fact that they put a lot of moneyinto campaign contributions for council members created a certain privilege for Chevron. Oil giant Chevron is pushing for a multi-million dollar refund on its property taxes. At the same time, Chevron announced big profits today. GAYLE: When I ran for city council, I n by fighting hard against a large corporation, who rey conducted an out and out campaign against me. We have a vision for green jobs that will not only put moneyin the pockets of our residents but will also show that we can meet our energy needs. We definitely could be a solar cityif you have the political will. There's a relving door between governments and fossil fuel interests, and so they are protected in large part from competition. We subsidize dirty energy with investment and tax credits, we refine them in communities that are already marginal and dispossessed, like Richmond. And they've concentrated a lot of wealth and power. So we've got to change power supply, and that will mean changing power relations, too. If we got full taxes from Chevron, we uld be so flush in money that we could put that moneyinto stimulating the green economy. Energy policy is social policy. Because solar power is distributed, because it is local, because it can be owned by the peoplethat use it, we can make a fairer, cleaner, lower cost rld. That's an amazing reversal of fortunes, putting power in the hands of the people both litery and figuratively. That is the potential of solar. Here's the power formula, lts times Amps equals Watts. Watts is power. : Training for a new field of rk at forties is frightening. It's absolutely frightening 'cause you don't know in the back of your mind if it's gonna be an age thing. Now I lost me. Yeah, you take a big step backwards. Look, you got eight modules. Right. One string... Is twelve. Twelve lts what? How y amps? One. : Here, I'm a college educated personand I have no job. So that's definitely frightening. -When you wire in parel... -Amps go up. So where did you get 24 from? Because it's the Watts. It's the Watts. : That fear uld be the method of my motivation. You didn't put the t strings together in series, you put them together in parel. Oh! You are like, this far away from having nailed it, . You're doing good! You got another cable? Down low. Down low. So yeah, just find a bare piece of wire there, that's perfect. And now you've got to go to the positive side. Okay, this one's good. That's the positive positive? Good. Yes, that's the positive positive. -And on the other side? -Which is parel. Good. Just watch your hair blow there, okay, ? I never thought that this uld be so easy to get a fan going off solar panels. I am cool right now even though I am in the sun. : What do you got going there, Rick? Well we found this music box here. We decided we ted to try to power this up with some solar modules. Hit the switch. It's too fast. Look at that. We couldn't recognize the song. We couldn't recognize the song, because there's too y lts running through it. Correct. When we cut it down to f. Ready? Stevie nder. And it's powered by the sun. Awesome. : Solar was started by hippies in the '70's. Yes, those crazy tree huggers that everybody hates, were right. By the way, it wasn't the hippies, it was us hippies, right? Yeah. : The early adopters were people concerned with the environment. But when it reached the public, it was more out of independence mixed with necessity. The oil producing countries of the Arab rld decided to use their oil as a political weapon. They will reduce oil production by five percent... : The solar industry had one of itslarger eras of public adoption during the oil embargoes of the 1970s. No more gas, out of gas. RICHARD NIXON: We must face up to a stark fact. We are now consuming more energy than we produce. : During the Nixon era, OPEC raised oil prices overnight, very much shocking the nation. The oil is declining, and the problem will be a problem of availability and not a problem of prices. When you are thirsty in the desert, you are ready to pay whatever you have money in your pocket for a glass of water. : We saw it again under the Carter administration during the Iranian relution. The Iranians cut back supplyand spiked the price of oil in America. : We were afraid we're going to run out of oil, not have enough oil and it was basicy being rationed. This intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our nation. : President Carter actuy set an energy agenda. He ted us to be on 20% renewable energy by the year 2000. Today in directly harnessing the power of the sun, we're taking the energy that God gave us, the most renewable energy that we will ever see, and using it to replace our dwindling supplies of fossil fuels. Solar energy will not pollute our air or water, we will not run short of it. No one can ever embargo the sun... or interrupt its delivery to us. : President Carter put solar panels on the White House. Ronald Reagan took 'em off the second day he was in office. One of Ronald Reagan's secretaries actuy said that solar was not a technology befitting a super power. We were left with of these greattechnologies in solar, wind, storage that were invented in the United States, but we just didn't have the policy in place to deploy them at scale. The oil industry, they receive 20, 30 billion dollars a year from the US government in subsidies. When you have a system that's been in place for 100 years and you've been making money for 100 years, the last thing you t is innovation that actuy turns that system on its head. Oil and gas produce massive amounts of energy. Wind and Solar don't. We couldn't build enough solar panels and enough wind mills. It uld still be fossil fuels... I t an energy policy that rks, not this nonsense of supporting wind and solar. I love the South. Solar makes sense for the South because... Look! Look outside today! Look at the sunshine. Solar is becoming so affordable, utility companies see solar as a threat. And they rey began to fight now very hard with everything they've got. : The Green Tea Coalition, as it's ced, hascome together to break what they say is the unfair monopoly state law givespower companies to deliver electricity. Solar, they say, is the way to do it. : The Green Tea Coalition, we asked Georgia Power to include more solar in their integrated resource plan. This was led by Republicans. But we're facing a battle, we were attacked. : Despite the Tea Party support, a political group founded by billionairebrothers Charles and David Koch ts Georgia's utility regulatorsto reject the new solar plan. Follow the money. Koch funded groups like ALEC and Americans for Prosperity are pulling out the stops on a local level to stop solar. Energy freedom and liberty is not a Democrat issue, it is not a Republican issue, it is an American issue. : As China moves from the factory of the rld to the clean tech laboratory of the rld, it's rking with partners from around the rld to deploy large amounts of capitalto be able to buy this equipment, inst it in large pieces of land in China. And it does it at a pace that is frankly, a China pace, right, in a blink of an eye. The government gave more and more support for clean energy. They gave me the bank's support. I got a low interest loan. They issued a law. And the government has started to promote local people to use more and more solar. We plan to create 8,000 job opportunities for the jobless in Texas. My solar city project is supported by the Texas governor. And this is Perry. He's my friend. He supports me very much in promoting solar energy in the U.S. I told you. I have a dream. I t to go to the U.S. and buy land to build the solar city. The solar city will be including the factory, training center, convention center, hotel and solar m. That's my dream. After the solar city is built, then we can use free energy, and also create jobs and also save money. : Green For is part of a much larger movement of groups that are trying to propose climate solutions that actuy create jobs and make us better off. We're gonna be trying to get legislation done this year in Congress. It's going to be very stressful. This is the first time I've heard rey be frustrated because she's got to be with t sick kids for a week. And so she's like, "Why are you going again?" You know? Like, "I don't understand why this is so important." And these kinds of things... It's just...it's hard. We have an opportunity to solve the t biggest crises possibly ever to face this country. An economic catastrophe and a climate crisis. We have an opportunity to do something that no generation of Americans has ever had the opportunity to do. We can build a green economy, we have the opportunity to connect the people who most need rk with the rk that most needs to be done and fight pollution and poverty at the same time. This is the chance for America finy to return to its roots as the most important economy in the rld, not because we are the number one consumers, but because we are the number one producers. That was pretty good. We got 500 million dollars for the Green Jobs Act! This is great! Excellent day! Excellent day! Thank you! We're just changing the rld, America changing the rld. No autographs. How are ya, how are ya? I don't t to rk at the Chevron refinery, I just don't t to be around those different chemicals and gases and whatnot. Like I think in the longterm, I think in the longterm it does affect a lot of people. And, like when my dad passed away from cancer it's just something I'm scared of. I know this one. This, oh, you and your dad. Boy, you guys tickled me. Right now in Richmond there's not much opportunity as far as employment. A lot of the industries have pulled out and left. I just knew you was gonna grow up to be an engineer of some kind, because you always ted to figure out how things rked. My hope for Edward is that he comes out of this program with skills and knowledge that cancarry him through his life, and be able to sustain himself. : I just t a job. It doesn't have to be a green job. I t a job, a good paying job. I was in the solar class, walked in, and seen an open seat next toa pretty girl, and I went and sat down. 's very talkative and so she just struck up a conversation. Yes, ma'am. uld you mark the rafters? already knew a lot about solar and construction in general. So she was able to help me a lot, because I was fresh and didn't know much of anything. rking with her, I grew an interest for solar. It makes it funner having a beautiful there helping you. Okay, you and up, just rk together, okay? You carry it like that, you bring it here. : Most men might be afraid of the whole electricity thing. It sounds dangerous, but I feel pretty confident in the things that I've learned. Just t to make sure that I'm doing everything the way I'm supposed to be. Get that belt tight. Okay, so the pants are not down to here right. It's the heat, he's delirious. I'm most looking forward to actuy insting a real solar panel on someone's home, like... because I never thought about this stuff. I know that I have it in me to become an inster. : A Bay Area homeowner today got thousands of dollars rth of free rk done on his home, and in the process some kids are learning a new craft. You might c it a win-win situation. Go to the first available bracket there. This is the point where we said that... Right there? This looks pretty good right there. Coming up, let me know when you got it. Let's lean that one up against here... Put it into place. Okay, great. Perfect. : Once I figured out what solar rey was and how you can supply energy to your own house, I was thinking I could wire up my own house with solar panels and save some money there. Five, four, three, t, one... Zero. : Solar! That's the free power that you're getting from the sun right now. right, get out of here, get out. : You're making more than you're using right now. So I'm not having to pay anything right now? -Not right now no. -This moment. I'm not having to pay nothing. Hello! I like them numbers. Are we going to do this in the City of Oakland? I live in Oakland. Yeah, we're doing it in Oakland. Well, how come I don't know nothing about it? I'll give you my card. Give me your card... They're doing it in Oakland... Oh, my God, am I going to be able to get solar? Am I going to be pumped from the sun? Obama, Obama, Obama. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, and begin again the rk of remaking America. We will harness the sun, and the winds, and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories, to meet the deds of a new age. For the first time we're going tohave a president that is taking the environment and energy and climate crisis seriously. I got a phone c from Carol Browner who is the Energy Czar for Obama and... She ts me to join her team. She said that she was facing a big set of chenges in the White House, and that somebody with my particular gifts could make a big contribution. You know aside from relocating the family and those kinds of issues which I feel, you know, like we uld just deal with, if that's what the decision that you make, if that's what you t to do, we'll just deal with that. My main concern is you running Green For is, in my opinion, rey important. I guess I'm just not sure that you going to the White House is gonna be the most effective way for you to use your skills to serve. For me like the criteria isn't you know, what's going to be the, you know, the best kind of like resume booster, the legacy I t to leave for these guys is "he got some people some jobs," you know, he made some stuff happen." We got anymore tape? Yeah. : A Bay Area community activist, who over the years has fought against the establishment, is now moving to the establishment's epicenter, the White House. President Obama has tapped Oakland's Jones to be the White House's special advisor for green jobs. : I'm moving the family to DC. I feel blessed in this crazy way. It's like three months ago if you sat me down and said, "What is the best possible job that you could have in the White House? The best possible job, don't hold back. And then we're going to add whipped cream and sprinkles to it." It's still only been f as good as a job I actuy got. I can kind of pick the problems I t to solve, and then have tremendous support getting them solved. I like the-- depending on how you do the math, somewhere between six and 13 billion dollars for energy efficiency for buildings. This is one solution that's good for the environment in terms of saving energy and cutting carbon emissions that will save you money. You know, I think we should retrofit every building in the United States. I have the authority to try to figure that out for the White House. I think that we should do a major effort with regard to green jobs for rural America. I've got the authority to do that. I get to pick those as problems to solve and do 'em. That's a great job. Joining me now the President's Special Advisor on green jobs, Jones. What Barack Obama ts to do, is give the people with the big ideas support so they can compete. And you're gonna unleash a tidal wave of innovation, a title wave of entrepreneurship for sm business for the new folks who get in here, shake up this energy sector and create new jobs. Last semester I was going to college and it rey wasn't for me. I didn't like sitting in the classroom, and I just didn't like school. I found this program and I'm saying they opened up brand new opportunities and brand new doors for me that I never thought about. I didn't even know how to drive a nail before I came in here. Thanks to Andre, though, I can hit nine in a minute. I t to thank of my classmates for helping me, I got love for y', and I appreciate everything y' did for me, thank you. You're turning your lives around improving your lives, for yourself, for your families. You're helping Richmond change its image because you are showing other cities that we are ready in Richmond, we are ready for those green jobs, we most definitely are. The moment we've been waiting for, Muldrow. Edward Wiltz the second. ! ! ! ! ! ! This is fantastic, I am so proud of him. It's been a long haul since his dad passed and my heart is full, my heart is so full. Thank you. I'm proud of you, I'm so proud of you. I'm ready to go to rk, right now. We can start. As hurricane Sandy moves west, it has left an unprecedented path of destruction. Over eight million are without power. What we saw after super storm Sandy is that Global warming threatens us , everybody. In business you rk in facts, and when you know 99 percent of the rld scientists agree that beyond a shadow of a doubt this thing is happening and it could have catastrophic consequences for huity. I'm gonna substitute my judgment for them? You know, no way. NRG, we're the second largestpower company in the United States. The biggest and most profitable of the power plants we have always owned are coal plants. Our fleet was aging and it was carbon intensive, and I didn't think that was good for the long term future of the company. At NRG we started a strategic shift towards clean energy. You're talking about somewhere between a trillion and a 1.5 trillion dollar market. You know, there aren't too y otheropportunities out there like that, so I don't think we can afford not to do this. The goal that the rld's scientists give us is reducing the carbon in the atmosphere 80% by 2050. The electricity sector is the biggest single issue. We have to go to zero. Zero carbon emissions. I'm confident the electricity sector can be 100% renewable power. Just three days ago, Gery was 75% on renewable power and you know Berlin did not collapse, lo and behold. : Welcome to Dusseldorf, ladies and gentlemen. Please keep your seat belts fastened. My suggestion is we can set up joint venture branding to develop the China market and the global market. Let's rk out strategy of what we can do in the future. We ufacture in China or in U.S. I don't see U.S. but... That's MOU. M-O-U. For business cooperation between Westech and Resol. Thank you. I hope we can do more business together. : Gery is the biggest market for solar energy. In Gery, they adapted very fast. They issued a lot of laws, to encourage people to use solar energy. Gery has decided to switch off its nuclear power stations by 2022. The move is intended to turn Europe's largest economy into a frontrunner for creating renewable energy and jobs. European Union has a target of 20% renewables by 2020. I think that's not going fast enough. I think we could easily come to80% renewables by 2030, no problem. It's not a technical problem at . It's a problem of political will. And it's a problem of breaking the influence of the big companies that provide our energy now. : For this renewable energy, we need the government to give the guidelines and encourage people to use solar energy. I think the U.S. needs to take action. The United States simply hasn't figured out how to do solar effectively and cheaply. You look at the country of Gery, it's rking out great for them. -And they've got lots of sun. -Right. They've got a lot more sun than we do, and the problem is that it's a cloudy day and it's raining, you are not going go have it. The sun shines on average in Gery as much it does in London. Even if you account for the subsidies the Ger government and the Gery people paid to get that solar, they still netted 300,000 jobs. So we are four times as big and twice as capable, so you do the math. It's t and a f million jobs if we did what they did. : If you t a green economy, if you t to stop dumping mega tonsof carbon pollution into our atmosphere then you have to look at the polluters, and give the polluters some reason to stop polluting. We had a strategy and the solution was cap and trade. The basic idea, very simple,nobody should be able to pollute for free. Simple as that. You can't pollute for free. If you go out here right now and throw a tin can on the ground and a police officer sees you, you'll get a fine. Why? It's a civilized country. You can't pollute for free. Big oil, big coal, you've got to say to these people, guess what, you're the most profitablecompany in the history of the rld. You don't get any more tax breaks and goodies from us. We're going to limit how much of this planet-baking pollution we can put up in a year, and every year we're going to put up lessand less until we're done. So you instantly begin to put yourresearch and development dollars towards the clean solutions. In new technologies, new innovations, and deploying them so people get jobs. On this te, the Bill is passed. Cap and trade legislation passes the House, now it's on to the Senate. I don't think we realized when we started tugging on that little string. What if the economy were better? What if it were better for poor people? What if it were better for generations yet to come? I don't think we rey realized how threatening that little thread was to people who make a lot of money with the tapestry just the way it is. : Fact. Cap and trade will mean higher electric bills. The fact is America can't afford the cap and trade tax. Tell your Senator to te no. The federal government taking over the economy, that's rey what cap and trade's about. You know if we let this cap and trade go through, if you think you're getting money taken from you now, just wait if that thing gets through. Americans for prosperity may look like a grassroots group because of its bus tours, and its ries, but the Koch brothers founded that and they fund that organization. So it's the big attack dog that they're using to defend their carbon-based wealth. In this report we went through the rld's billionaires from the Forbes list and we looked at who is actuy wielding their wealth to stop the solutions like solar, like wind, like energy efficiency and you see rey towards the top here, that's where we get to learn about Charles and David Koch. They co-own Koch industries, a conglomerate whose fortune is based on fossil fuels. They funnel millions of dollarsover the years to legions of lobbyists, think tanks, and fake grassroots agentsthat protect the fossil fuel interests. Let's bring in Phil Kerpen, he is the director for Policy for Americans for Prosperity. I think I this is a watermelon, Bill. And I think you're exactly right. This Bill is green on the outside and inside it's deep Communist red. : The idea of a price on carbon, Americans for Prosperity and Beckcame down hard on that idea. Now he's gone after the proponents of it like Jones. : He saw in green jobs kind of the kernelof capitalism's destruction and I think Obama agrees with that. At a certain point, I started getting Google alerts of . One day, there's like 30 that are just crazy, then there like 50, and there is like 60, I mean, it was just, you could see this kind of increase in chatter. He's a former Black Nationalist. An awed Communist. He came out an anarchist... And he is in the Obama administration. : Today, Republican congress Pence ced on Jones to resign, or for President Obama to fire this controversial Czar. Should he stay or should he go? Well, there is no doubt he should go. I nder if Obama has the guts to get rid of this guy. : And they're not about him rey. They're about trying to find an in-road into attacking the administration. : Before is was just Fox and now it's the mainstream as well. I think I should quit tonight. I think you should listen to it before you make a decision. Honey... I'm just saying. Honey, this is going to be every day, rse and rse and rse. I don't see... It has nothing to do with your job. The media has nothing to do with reality, but the people of the United States, will have heard of Jones by the end of this month, and it n't be good. I mean this is a full on war against me. We uld have to have everybody we know defending everything I've ever done, forever. : The heat is on President Obama and his controversial Green Jobs Czar, Jones. The question now, will Jones resign, be fired, or maybe actuy survive this whole thing? Joining us now, here in Washington... Jones resigned in a letter, quote, "Opponents of reform have mounteda vicious smear campaign against me. They are using lies and distortionsto distract and divide... I have been inundated with csfrom across the political spectrum urging me to stay and fight. But I came here for others, not for myself." : It was so devastating because you litery were one step away from opening the floodgates of private investment, of new entrepreneurs, of new jobs. And the House passed a rules change, but the Senate uldn't even take a te. : In nearly 80 different countries around the globe, solar is as affordable as electricity from the grid. : The sun is free to every country. So there is no end to the solar business. This must be a good market for the future. There's a huge market for the future. : There is a big ded, especiy for developing countries. Still some countries do not have a grid system. For solar, they do not need to build the grid. They just put solar on the roof. Then they can have light. Just like Johnny Appleseed. I spread my solar seeds rldwide. This year I've traveled to more than 30 countries. Hi. Bonjour. Hi. Bonjour. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. We can charge in the daytime and once nighttime is coming, we have this sensor, so this is rking. For the poor people, you can improve life. This is cool. Rey. Kerosene is so bad for the health. We are going to give light to 500 million Africans. : Everyday, I see the sunset and sunrise in a different country. We live on the earth. The earth is one globe. It's a village. A global village. So beautiful here. Oh, my God. I think more and more my dream will come true and more and more solar will be used. I think energy is just like love because y people need love. y people need energy, especiy need free energy. : Take him off my list. Seven eight seven seven... I'm a solar inster and I'm out here looking for rk and I was ndering if you were hiring today? : You know, I believe we are looking for rkers. Let me see if our HR department is available right now. w, I can't believe. That's the first time they actuy said "Yeah, I think we are looking for people." I waited a year for that. Good morning. - Muldrow. -, nice to meet you. The reason I got into solar, I believe that's the future. I kind of missed the dot com, so I'm kind of hoping this is the big boom that hasn't happened yet, maybe to you guys, but not me. : What are you targeting as far as pay rate? You know... It's whatever you guys are going to pay. I'm not going to try to go higher or lower. I'm ready to rk, showing up ready to rk, -whatever you tell me to do, -Yeah. these people say, "But I had an uncle who used to rkat a ufacturing facility 40 years ago and he no longer has a job, and therefore I hate China." Right, I get it. But when you look at a solar powered project, only about a third of the cost of thatis the actual solar panel. The other t thirds of the cost of that is design, instation, sales, marketing service, which are American jobs, 100% American jobs. You can't outsource those jobs to other places. If China actuy drives the cost of solar prices down, then more solar is cost effective versusthe electric utility industry and more Americans get jobs, because more solar can be insted. The thing that you learn from China is that solar can grow so fast. And so that means the government actuy has to send real signals to the market place for an entrepreneur to thrive. We need "We're gonna do this like the moonshot" kind of clarity. We're gonna go to the moon and back in a decade, we're gonna re-wire America with clean energy in a decade. We in America need to make that c and go forward into the future like those other countries or we'll get left behind. : Being pro solar aligns with Conservative values because it's free market. It provides competition for these monopolies. There have been some that have said that those that support green energy are communist. Well, I'm a right wing Conservative. I have been ced a lot of things, but I have never ever been ced a Communist. The Green Tea Coalition rked with Sierra Club and other environmental activistsand guess what, we n this battle in addition to more solar being added, so has more jobs. We don't have to wait on the gridlock in Washington DC. One state at a time, we will win this relution. GRID alternatives, this non-profit organization, mounts free solar on low income people's homes. I kind of think it's funny that, you know, I haven't been able to get a job yet, but you know I'm getting solar on my house. This is a live wire. I think I didn't make it because the ded's not there yet. But I got to tell you that putting solar on my house was the best decision ever. Our electrical bill was 80 to 90 bucks a month, now its chopped down to about five bucks a month. 'Cause it's yours. You ain't paying everybody every month and you get a low bill. Before we got solar, I uld alwayshear about the electrical bill, but its real low now. Right now my house is as green as it could be, and that came from solar training. The ten goes here? Yeah and that's the first panel we're going to lay. Okay. : I actuy just got full time. I luckily interviewed with this company first, I sent them an email and they ced meback in like 30 minutes, I had a job the next day. the panels are connected to each other and it's just through the J-box from the J-box and it travels to the inverter. Boom, boom. And boom, boom. I like insting in neighborhoods I'm familiar with and I grew up in, and where I got family and friends. I actuy insted these solar panels right up here. While I am at rk, I'm seeing people I know. And they're looking at me like, "What you doing?" "I am rking , that's what I'm doing." That's it. : After a while I found myself making tripsto come see him outside of class. I just kind of graduy moved in. : I t to provide a good situation for my girlfriend... my future family... With this career, I could be a project ager, engineer. I could help design systems. I hope to seize of those opportunities. Tell David to tell my 4:45 cer to c me closer to five, that might be good, to give us enough time, but just... Okay bye, but I'm ready now. Thanks, bye. : By the time the real facts came out, I had already resigned. I don't know what my next steps are. And, you know, I made the choice that I made. I'll always second guess it, I'll always go back, I will always walk it through in my mind, but nothing that has happened has reduced my faith and confidence in the final outcome. Maybe I n't be in the White House doing it or whatever, but that wasn't my goal in the first place. My confidence always was in ordinary people. JIGAR: What's so crazy about solar, is that the fight can happen locy. That means people actuy have to get inlved locy. Like, don't buy a Prius. For the love of God, go to your local city council meeting, go to your local utility. Tell them you t clean energy. That's how things change and that's how you'll get a job. Hey hey, ho ho, Hydro-fracking's got to go. : If you're waiting for Washington DC to act, you're going to be waiting for a long time. States, tribes, cities, that's where the action is going to be. And who are they giving the microphone to? I'm not on the main stage talking. They're giving grassroots activiststhe floor. Because they're gonna be the ones to get it done. I'm an Asian-American mother of kids with asthma, from Oakland, California. We are front line Asian immigrant families who face fires from refineries year after year because Chevron is in our backyards. We're tired of waiting for the United Nations to solve the climate problem. : You can't stop this green movement despite this collapse in Washington DC. You still have a green economy that's growing. We will have a global green economy. Close your eyes, go to sleep, we'll freeze you cryogenicy. When we thaw you out in 100 years, we will have a green economy. This is the future of huity, if we have a future, this is it. : In Paris this morning a potential landmark deal is being revealed on climate change after t weeks of talks. The agreement cs for almost 200 nationsto reduce -made emissions of green house gases and uld be legy binding. : How significant is this deal, do you think? Massive. For the first time ever, we are onthe verge ofhaving an agreement that moves us out of carbon heavy emissions and into a future that thinks about alternative energies. This is an incredibly ambitious planthat will completely remake the rld economy, if it's actuy enacted. We need clarity and signals from above in policy, we need to create more businesses and fill more niches with this incredible American invention. The solar cell, which is the heart of the machine, will be deployed on awnings and tent-like materials. Windows will have translucent photoltaics, they'll be facade materials for architectsto create a beautiful aesthetic, as well as some electricity for the building. The cell phone will have a solar panel on the back of it, and you n't have to plug the thing in. So now I'm hooked up to my solar electric power supply. So now I'm charging. It's solar. Carbon free. : You'll roll your electric car onto a mat and through inductive charging, your car will charge overnight. The only way you can do that is gonna be by harnessing wind and the sun. DANNY: In the United State, the solar industryis less than 1% of electricity supply, and we already employ 120,000 people. So when we're ten to 20% electricity supply, we'll be hundreds of thousands and millions of rkers. We'll be one of the biggest employers in the country. United States and China are the t largest emitters of carbon in the atmosphere. If the US and China rk together,that uld be a game changer on this-- on the idea of global warming climate change. It doesn't just take one country to implement solar and deploy solar around the rld. The rld is completely interlinked. Bottom line, we have very little time leftto get our act right. It's not the US and China at stake. The rld is at stake. : I love Texas. Total we have 210 acres of land. This side will be the training center. Because we need to train the people. That area my solar factory will be. This side will be the solar city. And we will build the hotel and convention center. More than 3,000 people will be rking here. This is my dream. Can you imagine it?
