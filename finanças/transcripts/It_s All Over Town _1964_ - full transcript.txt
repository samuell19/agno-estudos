Occupation: electrician. Preoccupation: girls! In fact, like most of us, just an average hardworking man protected by his employer's Insurance Policy should he fall down from his job, and protected by his Union from his employers should he fall down on the job. Tonight, after the show, he is going out on the town with his friend Willie. As he falls asleep, he thinks of girls. He dreams he is living it up in a bunny club with his friend Willie. That's the fat one. What is a Bunny? What indeed! A Bunny is a night club hostess who meets a modern human need. How to feel naughty without having to be naughty. Like so much of our contemporary culture, the idea was imported from America, where apparently the male appetite can be both stimulated and sated when girls are offered, and at the same time, forbidden. The Bunnies will dine with you, wait on you, twist with you, but woe betide the man who breaks the Commandment, "Thou Shalt Not Touch."

Here is what our two heroes have really been waiting for. The crux of the evening's entertainment, the art, for they say it is an art of striptease. Ever since it was reported in the Good Book that Salome danced the Dance of the Seven Veils, women have been shamelessly removing their garments in public, and of course, in private too. [joyful music] In this so-called enlightened, Freudian age, titillation, the hand maiden of this sort of performance, is ever present. Apparently, it requires from the "lady" a sense of poise, of timing, and balance. From the audience, it requires a sense of full participation and this it invariably gets! [general chatter] Shh. -Shh yourself. -Shh. [jazz music] [joyful music] [whistle blows] ♪ I've been a naughty boy But I regret it ♪ ♪ I'm gonna ask you now ♪ ♪ Oh, please forget it ♪ ♪ There's gonna be A most remarkable change come over me ♪ ♪ Now, just you wait and see ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ No more lies ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ Dry your eyes ♪ ♪ I've been a fool, oh, such a fool ♪ ♪ You'll never know how ♪ ♪ Gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ I am a simple boy ♪ ♪ I'm sentimental ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take you out ♪ ♪ And treat you gentle ♪ ♪ I wanna take you To the movies or take you to a dance ♪ ♪ Give me one more chance ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ No more lies ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ Dry your eyes ♪ ♪ I've been a fool, oh, such a fool ♪ ♪ You'll never know how ♪ ♪ Gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ I wanna spend my days ♪ ♪ With you I know it ♪ ♪ I've got a lot of love ♪ ♪ And I will show it ♪ ♪ I'm gonna give you All the pretty things you have ever seen ♪ ♪ I won't treat you mean ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ No more lies ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ Dry your eyes ♪ ♪ I've been a fool, oh, such a fool ♪ ♪ You'll never know how ♪ ♪ Gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ Gonna be a good boy now ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ [applause] [whistle] [narrator] And who is this seeking convivial company? Aha. It is the "Lady Peeler." In matters of sex, the cunning and finesse the Englishman is notorious. His apparent self-restraint is a key opening doors to the betrayal of good women the world over. What clearer example could you have than these two depraved creatures busy plying the lady with strong drink for a purpose only too easily imagined and imagined it will have to be, for this is a dream, and we can be spared the ignominious spectacle of their ejection. From the Bunny Club, Richard Abel and his crony move by taxi through the great capital city of London. It is said by the Sassenachs that London offers all that is best in the best of all possible worlds. Who, they can be heard to say, when passing the law courts, does not reflect on the incorruptibility of the London Police Force, on the freedom of British justice from the temptations to which we more ordinary mortals are subject. Who, they say, can pass the great bastion of English history, the Tower of London, without thrilling to its living tradition? Well, I can for one! Today, a tourist attraction, those beefeaters for 400 years have been faithfully guarding the Crown Jewels of England. Further up the river, we come to the temples of music, to the Festival Hall, the Albert Hall, and the Royal Victoria Hall.

The magical metamorphosis technically known in the theatre as the transformation scene. Now the theatre echoes with sounds of frenzied activity, and we are suddenly aware of that invisible bond binding artist and technician into a creative unity. Each knows his appointed place, each exercises an iron self-discipline directed to but one end, the end being that tradition of the theatre best summed up by those immortal words "The show must go on." [jazz music playing] [bear growls] [bear growls] [bear growls] -Brothers. -[bear growls] "It has come to my attention, brothers, that the management is engaging Russian bears for this film." [bear growls] [joyful music] "American bears, brothers, of course, are black." -[joyful music] -[bear growls] That not a single one of her bear members has been engaged. However, I have been assured by the management that these Russian bears are not fierce. Ah! [bear growls] [narrator] Unbearable indeed! And who would disagree with you? But if London has its spiritual wastelands, it also has its centres of moral and physical well-being. ♪ Please ♪ ♪ Let it happen to me ♪ ♪ Let it happen like love walk in ♪ ♪ Let the story begin ♪ ♪ If the time is right Somewhere along the way ♪ ♪ I will meet somebody who will say ♪ ♪ Please, let it happen to me ♪ [joyful music] ♪ I don't want a love ♪ ♪ Who will be just like any other ♪ ♪ She will see All I want is someone ♪ ♪ Who will care for me More and more each day ♪ ♪ In every way ♪ ♪ Please, let it happen to me ♪ ♪ Let it happen like love walk in ♪ ♪ Let the story begin ♪ ♪ If the time is right Somewhere along the way ♪ ♪ I will meet somebody who will say ♪ ♪ Please, let it happen to me ♪ ♪ Why can't it happen to me? ♪ ♪ Please, let it happen to me ♪ [clarinet playing] [church bell rings] [jazz music playing] ♪ There is the sweetest girl You've ever seen ♪ ♪ Just take one look And you'll see what I mean ♪ ♪ Take a look over there ♪ ♪ She's the one with the hair ♪ ♪ And I've been sippin' cider ♪ -♪ Beside 'er ♪ -[chorus] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ -♪ Beside 'er ♪ -[chorus] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ -♪ Beside 'er ♪ -[chorus] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ -♪ Beside 'er ♪ -[chorus] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ ♪ She's got the biggest pair of ♪ ♪ Deep blue eyes ♪ ♪ It don't take long Before you realise ♪ ♪ Can't remember her name ♪ ♪ Now, ain't that a shame ♪ ♪ Cause I've been sippin' cider ♪ -♪ Beside 'er ♪ -[chorus] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ -♪ Beside 'er ♪ -[chorus] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ -♪ Beside 'er ♪ -[chorus] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ ♪ Beside 'er ♪ ♪ I wandered over just before So I could see her clearer ♪ ♪ She got prettier more and more, yeah As I got nearer ♪ ♪ Well, now, I think I'll wander back to her ♪ ♪ She'll start to wonder What I'm looking for ♪ ♪ There is one thing I know ♪ ♪ That's she's loaded up with dough ♪ ♪ So I'll keep sippin' cider Beside 'er, yeah ♪ ♪ Wandered over just before So I could see her clearer ♪ ♪ She got prettier more and more, yeah As I got nearer ♪ ♪ Well, now, I think I'll wander back to her ♪ ♪ She'll start to wonder What I'm looking for ♪ ♪ For there's one thing I know ♪ ♪ Yeah, she's loaded up with dough ♪ ♪ So I'll keep sippin' cider Beside 'er, yeah ♪ ♪ And I'll keep sippin' cider ♪ [hiccup] ♪ Beside 'er ♪ [trumpet plays] [general chatter] ♪ Now, you listen, fellers ♪ ♪ You big drinkin' fellers ♪ ♪ You've caused trouble Since the world began ♪ ♪ Now, listen, all you fellers ♪ ♪ I've been thinkin', fellers ♪ ♪ Woman is the downfall of man ♪ ♪ The trouble with man is woman I believe ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ The trouble with man is woman I believe ♪ ♪ A woman called Eve a long time ago ♪ ♪ Gave Adam an apple and everyone knows ♪ ♪ That the Garden of Eden They were made to leave ♪ ♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah Woman is to blame ♪ ♪ Oh no, oh no Man puts us to shame ♪ ♪ The trouble with woman is man We do believe ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ The trouble with woman is man We do believe ♪ ♪ Napoleon loved his Josephine ♪ ♪ But he gave her the air When he wanted a queen ♪ ♪ The trouble with women is man We do believe ♪ ♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah Man puts us to shame ♪ ♪ Oh no, oh no Woman is to blame ♪ ♪ The trouble with man is woman I believe ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ The trouble with man is woman I believe ♪ ♪ Delilah made Samson rant and rave ♪ ♪ So she cut off his hair And he became her slave ♪ ♪ The trouble with man is woman I believe ♪ ♪ We do believe ♪ ♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah Woman is to blame ♪ ♪ Oh no, oh no Man puts us to shame ♪ ♪ The trouble with woman is man We do believe ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ The trouble with woman is man We do believe ♪ ♪ Anthony made Cleopatra cry ♪ ♪ When he went back to Rome She decided to die ♪ ♪ The trouble with woman is man We do believe ♪ ♪ We do believe ♪ -♪ Man ♪ -♪ Woman ♪ -♪ Man ♪ -♪ Woman ♪ ♪ We never will agree ♪ -♪ Man ♪ -♪ Woman ♪ -♪ Man ♪ -♪ Woman ♪ ♪ It's plain for all to see ♪ ♪ That the trouble with man is woman I believe ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ The trouble with woman is man We do believe ♪ ♪ We could argue like this All the whole night long ♪ ♪ So come on everybody Let's end this song ♪ ♪ The trouble with man is woman ♪ ♪ And the trouble with woman is man ♪ ♪ It's been the same Throughout our history ♪ ♪ But I ask you ♪ ♪ Without woman ♪ ♪ Where would mankind be? ♪ ♪ Oh yes ♪ Time, gentlemen, please!

For it is well known that any Londoner, with the inclination and a fast car, can drink 24 hours a day.
