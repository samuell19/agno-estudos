My lunch meeting finished early and he's still talking with the producers for this next movie. Pitching me for the lead role. He'll drop me off at my 1:00PM appointment so I just need you to leave my convertible at the Wilshire Valet. Alright, Katie. I'll see you later. Oh hey, Randall. So, what'd they say? How'd it go? I'm sorry, Madeline, they passed. They what?! I thought you said it was a sure thing? I know. I'm as surprised as you are. Look, I'm sure this isn't the news you wanted to get on your birthday, but... My birthday is next week. Thirty years you're my agent, you still don't know when my birthday is. So who'd they cast instead? Suzy James. - Suzy James? - Mm-hm. Suzy's Mercedes probably still has the training wheels on it. Madeline, hello? Are you hearing this, Richard? Yes, I know, sweetheart. Something else will come along. I just know it. Let's go. Just take a deep breath, Madeline. Look, the meeting wasn't all bad. There's another role. Here. Take another look. I know you're not suggesting I play the murderess to that little toddler. Suzy's 27 years old. That toddler's streaming deal's worth $200 million. Madeline, would you just consider it? Why don't you stop taking his side, Richard? I, I'm not siding with anyone. I just, I called you to let you know that I'm gonna stay another night at the beach house. Are you gonna be ok? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll ring you later. Maddie. I'm just saying as a friend, and as an advisor, that you are becoming a woman of a certain age and maybe that's something to think about moving forward. That's all I do think about. So, Madeline, I've studied your scans. And? Well... It needs to come out soon. But I want you to have a biopsy first. Take your time. Hey, this is Richard. Leave me a message. Richard, I really need you right now. I'm gonna head out to the beach house. I'll see you soon. Richard? Would you check out this view, huh? Well hello, Suzy James. Ah... Madeline, it, it... this isn't what it... Richard, don't even try it! You, out. Yep. I'll, I'll, I'll call... Look, honey, let's talk about this. This is it, Richard. Ok, I'm sorry. I... That's what you said the last time. But, I... I mean, did you... Did you ever care about me? Or was I just good for business? Madeline, let's just cool down and talk about this. Come here. This is my house. Built with my money. From my work. I want you out of it. I never want to see you again. Madeline, she means nothing to me. I need you out of this house. Tonight. Are you ok? What is that? Oh, it's my friend Sarah's. You met her last year when she taught you how to dive for that lake scene you did. I asked you if she could stay over in the guest suite overnight before she leaves for Montana tomorrow and you said yes. - I did? - Yes. - Well, fine. - Ok. Is something wrong? Yes. More than usual? Yes. Calls? Uh, Dr. Wiseley called, he said Dr. Moore can see you anytime in the next 12 days. After that, he will be volunteering overseas for the next three months and he left his contact information in New York. Are you going to New York? Yes? Um, Richard keeps calling. I don't want to talk to him. Ever. And I need you to call a locksmith, change all the locks in the beach house no matter what it costs, by the end of the day tomorrow. Ok. Who else? Grace Ballard from the... You know what? I'm done for the day. I'll call everybody back tomorrow. Just leave all the numbers in the kitchen and you can go. Of course. Have a good night. So Madeline, I've studied your scans. It needs to come out soon. But I want you to have a biopsy first. Just to be on the safe side. It's a straightforward procedure and I have a colleague in town who can take care of it for you. I don't want to do it in L.A. Everyone will know. What about New York? Well, I can recommend a Dr. Moore. Take your time. Richard, I really need you right now. You are becoming a woman of a certain age and maybe that's something to think about. Ok. Hello, this is Grace Ballard. Hi, this is Madeline Ellis, I'm returning your call from yesterday. Hello, Ms. Ellis, thank you for returning our call. You're welcome. How can I help you? I am an adoptees rights advocate for the New York Association of Children and Families. Oh, you did get this year's check, right? Yes. You've been so generous with your donations over the years. But I'm not calling about that. May I first ask you a few questions? Sure. Your full name is Madeline Rebecca Ellison, is that correct? That's my legal name. And are you the same Madeline Rebecca Ellison who gave up a baby girl on April 3rd, 1984? Ms. Ellis? Are you still there? Yes. Is that correct, Ms. Ellis? I need to confirm that information before I discuss this any further. Yes. I gave up a baby in 1984. Then I'm calling on behalf of your birth daughter. She has contacted the aid society in search of her birth mother. According to our records, that is you. And in her file there is a handwritten note signed by you that states that she may contact you after her 18th birthday, if she wishes. There is? Yes. So the question is, would you be willing to accept contact? Ms. Ellis? Uh, no. Thank you. Goodbye. Katie, call my driver. I'm going to New York. Mmmhmm. Well, no, I'd like to talk to Gary, please. Is he coming? Um... Alright, I'm heading out. Who are you? I'm Sarah. We met before. I taught you how to swim for that movie. Oh, right, you. Can one of you guys run upstairs and get the rest of my suitcases and bring them down to the driveway, please? I'm on hold. Do you mind, Sarah? Fine. How do you know her? We dated in college but it didn't really work out. But we've stayed the best of friends ever since. Hello? Gary! No, she only wants you. Is there another bus available? Luxury touring coach. Ok, thank you. I'll tell her. Uh, he has your bu... uh, touring coach in Detroit being repainted as per your instructions. I need to leave now, Katie. Right now. Do you want to fly? You know I don't fly. My heart is racing just thinking about it. Ok, I can arrange another driver but it'll take a... You know what, I will drive myself. Madeline, you can't drive to New York. This is crazy. You can't drive yourself across the country. You can barely drive yourself across town. I'll find you another driver, just give me a minute. No, it's perfect. It'll give me a chance to think. It's just what I need. Uh, can you get those bags over here, please? Hey, I remember you now. You got me to dive headfirst in some water and I don't even swim. Yeah, that's me. Do you need anything else from me today or can I go? You should drive me to New York. Madeline! Me? Yeah, you're young. Young people are always looking to make a buck. Plus you said you were going to Montreal or someplace, right? Montana. Practically on your way. I'll pay you. What, what did we pay Gary the last time he took me to New York? Oh, I don't remember exactly, but it was a lot. Plus gas and lodging. I'll pay you what I paid him. Plus gas and lodging? Yes. Oh no. How about my trip from New York to Montana? I'll pay for that too. And we take my car? Why? Because my stuff and your stuff are not gonna fit in this car. Plus, kayak has to go on top. Yeah, and it would ruin my roof. Yes, it would. Can you get me there in the next 12 days? Oh, with time to spare. - Deal. - Deal. Let's go! Oh boy. Does that mean we're... Does that mean we're leaving now? It looks like. Is she always like this? Yes, but this is a prize winner. Let's go! Alright. - Ok. - Shoot. I got it, it's fine. Have fun. Be careful with those. Very expensive. ♪ I hear the call of the highway ♪ ♪ Where the world stops... ♪ ♪ There's no need for, destination ♪ We'll be driving anyway ♪ - Madeline. - - Madeline? - - Madeline! - Huh? - Your phone. - Oh. Hi, Katie. What do you want me to do about your calls? Tell 'em I'll call 'em all back. And cancel all my appointments for the next three weeks. Ok. And, just so you know, Richard came by. Just after you two left. He did? What did you tell him? That we were out. Good. And tell him if he steps foot there one more time, or at the beach house, you're calling the police. Oh, it's Randall, Katie. I gotta go. Hey, Randall. You got a script for me? A lead this time. Hi, Madeline. Richard, what are you doing with Randall's phone? Well, Randall thought it would be a good idea if, that, you know, maybe you and I talked and, and made up. He only has your best interest at heart. Richard, your voice is literally making me carsick right now. Say what you have to say in the next ten seconds. Just, give him a chance Madeline, please. Sweetheart, I, I'm sorry. I was being... You're breaking up, Richard! Where are we? We're right outside of Barstow. Can we listen to some music? Yeah, sure. Maybe we could listen to something, with less noise? Uh, yeah sure. That's better.

The AC doesn't work? It is on. It's on as high as it can go. It's blowing out hot air. I mean, it's just circulating the air. Doesn't smell like it's circulating. What was that? I don't know. How did that happen? We ran over something. It happens. I threw my cell phone out the window. I... I can't call anybody. We're on a deadline. Calm down. I didn't throw my phone out a window and we have time to spare. What are you doing? What are you doing? What, you think it's gonna run better with less luggage? You can't leave my luggage out on the side of the road like that. I'm trying to get to the spare tire and I can't do that until I have moved the entire third floor of Saks Fifth Avenue. Well, you know, if you had cared for this car better, this might not have happened. Let's not talk about holding up, shall we? Need to borrow a pair of shoes? No. Thank you. These are more comfortable than anything I've seen you wear. Grace before comfort. Those do not look comfortable. You know what, who are you to talk to me like this? I'm paying you for this. You're right. I am a hired contractor paid to take you from point A to point B. Kind of like a piece of furniture. And you need me more than I need you. Especially now that you're stuck in the middle of nowhere in a pair of fancy high heels. - Fine. - Fine! And I thought Katie was exaggerating. What do you mean? Katie love me. Katie's paid to love you. Well maybe I should fire her then. Fire Katie? Katie would walk through fire for you. And how many people in your life can you say that about? You know what? Just fix the car. - Fine. - Fine. Madeline. Can't fix the car with you in it. - Fine. - Fine. Oh. Watch out in those heels. You know, you're really messing with people's heads, Madeline. I mean, who would expect you to be at a place like this? Certainly not me. What's wrong? Is there something in it? I don't drink out of plastic. Really? Hi. Oh, how sweet. Oh, good with kids, are we? Change places with me before I commit a crime. Mother of the year. Can you just keep an eye on my boat? Your boat? What's wrong with my boat? Just seems so inessential. That boat is made of 100 percent recycled plastic. A company from L.A. is paying for me to test it on rapids for people to enjoy. So I think that that's a win-win. Ok. Look, my ambitions might not match your standards of glamour, but, from what I've seen, being rich and famous hasn't made you the most fantastic human being. Can we have the check, please? I would choose my life over yours any day. Thank you. And, could we please get this woman a glass? I mean you can't expect her to drink out of plastic, it's Madeline Ellis, folks. That's a little more like it. You don't know anything about that. I actually didn't even know that they still played this on the radio. Yes. ♪ Now and then when I think about it ♪ It's almost like you were never gone ♪ If I try to be real about it ♪ I'm pretty sure that it's... ♪ You were young, and wild and beautiful ♪ I was lost in your emerald eyes ♪ You made me think I could have it all... We're changing that when we get back on the road. We've been listening to your music all day. Yeah. It's my car. Well, it's my money you're taking. Or do I have to pay extra for music privileges? If you want to fly, you can. No. Why are you scared of flying? I'm not... I'm not scared of flying. It's just that I don't like it. I don't like being squeezed up in a small space with all those people and everybody asking me for my autograph and selfies and I have to be nice. Madeline, we all know that you can afford a private jet. Why are we going to New York? Would you be nice to me if I asked you for an autograph? Fine. What, what is, what's going on? My car just doesn't like the altitude. We should have reached the interstate by now though. Can I please just turn on my GPS? No. I do not want to hear that thing talk. Besides, I like reading maps. And telling me what to do. Exactly. Uh-oh. Uh-oh? Uh-oh what? Oh my god! Is that a fire? No, we're- It's a fire! No, we're overheating. It's fine. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Overheating? It's- We're overheating. Got smoke! It's on fire! You've never seen a car overheat before, Madeline? No way. That is smoke. It's steam. That's smoke, Sarah. I know smoke when I see smoke. I don't want any of that smoke. It's steam, Madeline. It's just steam. It's smoke! Oh! Really? Oh, I'm not getting that. You know, she looks just like- Don't. But... Just. Like I don't know the difference between smoke and steam. That was smoke. My favorite pair of shoes... Well, there's a hotel two blocks over. Hotel? What do we need a hotel for? Just fix the car so we can leave. Ma'am! Ma'am. It's... may take a couple days to find a radiator to fit this old car. Ulgh! You said you wanted to take the scenic route. You could rent a car down valley. I'm not leaving my gear. Oh, for the love of... Ok fine, if you want to drive yourself, be my guest. Keep your money. I'm too tired to think about this. I'm gonna go check into the hotel. You stay here and deal with this car. - Fine. - Fine. Fine! Thanks for the jacket. You're welcome. Come on. I know she's... Yeah. Yeah. You know, the hotel's that way. Oh! Uh, hello. Hello. Are you? You're... Yes, hi, hello. I would like a suite please and a room for my companion. We don't have any suites. Uh, this is a bed and breakfast. As in shared bath? Yes, ma'am. Oh. Yeah, I don't share bathrooms with the general public. Is there another hotel in town? Uh, none that are open in the summer. This is a ski town. Fine. Two rooms, please. For how long? To be decided.

That is too dangerous. Well, it's a kayak not a canoe. So, we get the car in the next couple of days. We should reach Illinois... Oh, no. What? Remember that welder guy I was telling you about? Mmmhmm. He's coming over here right now. Hey. Hello. Do I recognize you? Well, I'm... The woman that passed my studio. You should have stopped to say hi. Well, yeah that... that was me. Alright, there's a pinball machine over there. You mind if I join you? Why not? Hey Carl, what can I get you two? I'll have a martini. I'll take a beer. Hope I didn't scare your friend away. Well, she's not really my friend. She's my driver. Oh, how fancy. So, what would a lady like yourself be doing sneaking around a metal shop? I wanted to say hello. Well, I guess I'm just not used to country manners. Besides, didn't your mom ever tell you not to speak to strangers? It's country trust. You're from the city. L.A. Well, no wonder you're so jumpy. Name's Carl. I'm Madeline. Yeah, I know who you are, Ms. Ellis. Well, you clean up real good, Carl. Well, it got me a drink with you. Well, I guess the shower was worth it. Want to make it interesting? Lowest score buys the beer? Cool. How about if I start? Ladies first. Uh, yeah, I'll play then winner plays Stan. Ah, sounds good. So how long were you married? Nine years. That's a chunk of time. Yeah. Gave her the best three years of my life. You're a real prince. How about you? Never married. Never? No. Very sweet of you to be so surprised. Well, you seem like the real deal to me. I do? And you're a great artist. Did you see my last series? I did. But that doesn't mean your next thing won't be great. Yeah, but you know what they say. You're only as good as your last project. No, you're only as good as your best work and you've racked up a lot of great work. Well, that's generous, but I appreciate it. Well. Would you look at that? You said you wanted to go next, right? Yeah. Cool. Be my guest. So, how did you end up here? A commission for the civic center. I, uh, fell in love with the town and never left. That was 15 years ago. Wow. Just like that. Yep. Just like that. I had a big studio in Chicago. Forty employees. Lots of politics and managing people and less and less time to make art with my own two hands. Sometimes you just want to bang some metal into something beautiful and forget about everything else. You know? Simplify. Simplify. That is a term I am unfamiliar with. Well, I highly recommend it. Finding the love again for what you do. Well, I do miss that. When I first started out, everything was an adventure. All the roles were so fun and challenging and deep and satisfying, you know? Yeah. Hits you in the heart when it's right. When it's good, you know. But those roles don't come along too much anymore, so... I think I've hit my expiration date. Come on, how many dewy-eyed coming of age romances do we need to sit through? Let's see some backbone and grit from women like you. Women with age and experience and knowledge. You know, sages in life. I just, I'm just tired of the hustle. So do your own thing. Think outside the box. Create your own next act. Write things down. Your story. Let something grow out of that. You know? That makes me really excited and tired at the same time. A good lie down is highly underrated. Amen to that. Speaking of the arts, would you like to go to a fundraiser cook-out with me tomorrow night? Let's see, tomorrow night. Am I free tomorrow night? Tomorrow night, tomorrow night... Yes. I'm free. Good. I think you'll like it. You like children? Uh, jury's still out on that. Ok, I'll pick you up at 6:00. And bring your driver. How do you know where I'm staying? There's only one place to stay here in the summer. Ok, well, see you tomorrow night. Alright. I'll see you tomorrow night. Good night. Good night. What? Nothing, just seemed like you were fitting in well with the locals. Well, I could say the same thing about you and your little pinball buddies. What is it? Just love places like this. Old cinemas. Want to go in? Are you thinking of doing something illegal tonight? Well if I was, I couldn't think of a better person to do it with than you. Just when I thought I had the Madeline Ellis figured out. It's not gonna be open. - Oh. - Madeline. Country trust. Come on. Oh, wow. This is beautiful. My parents used to love the movies. They would go to the theatre when they were teenagers. Three to four times a week. Sit in the front row and hold hands. Today's my birthday. Really? Happy birthday. Thanks. My mother was my age when she died. That's, um... Yeah. It's a big deal. I get it. But, you're not your mom. You're also very hardy. Don't ever call an actress hardy. But you are! I know you meant it as a compliment. And I am. But, I guess it just makes me feel a little guilty that I'll have more time here than she did. Don't feel guilty. I'm sure your mom would want you to have the most beautiful and long life that you could possibly have. Yeah. Yeah, she would. Let's go. Yeah, that's what we did back in the '80s, girl. That's what we did! Oh, man. Look at that. That is spectacular. You don't get that back in L.A. No. I don't think I look up in L.A. When I was a kid we used to shine our flashlights up to the stars and swear that the light bounced back to us. Of course we didn't know then that it takes years for the light from stars to get back to us. And, that they blaze the brightest right before they burn out. That must be positively dazzling. They're ok, I guess. Not the most robust of compliments, but I'll take it. Oh hey, the welder guy Carl invited us to a cook-out tomorrow night. But do you have the appropriate clothing for a cook-out? Uh, no, which is why I'll be borrowing something from you. When's the car gonna be fixed? Day after tomorrow, but don't worry. I'll get you to New York in time. Yeah, it's ok. This kind of feels like a vacation. It is a vacation. Which is why tomorrow I am taking you on a beautiful hike. Tomorrow when? Early. Ulgh. Oh. Tired? Exhausted. Sit down. Wouldn't you just kill for a cup of coffee? Yes. Me too. Thanks. This altitude. I don't know how mountain people do it. You get used to it. And how is there less oxygen up here than there is in filthy air in Los Angeles? Defies logic. Madeline, relax. Take in the forest. Isn't it beautiful? I mean, yeah. If you're into spectacular emerald forests. Coffee? Really? How about fresh-baked croissant? Yes, please! Look at you. So, uh, what about this Carl guy? Hm. It's just a great conversation with a mature fellow artist. That's it? I don't need or want anything else. At least not right now. How 'bout you? Is there a special lady in your life? Uh, there was, but not anymore. You know- I really don't want to talk about it. Um... But Carl and the cook-out? I mean, I'm all for you having fun, Madeline, because what's good for you is good for me. Know what's good? This croissant is good. Mm. Oh, children. A lot of 'em. It's a children's camp. Hello, Mr. Bowline! Hi, Jessica. This is Madeline Ellis and this is her friend, Sarah. Hi. - Hello. - Hello. I saw you in a movie once. - You did? Did you like it? - Mmmhmm. - Good. - You looked younger. Ah. Well, you know what? That's what they call in my business an occupational hazard. It's what happens when you see a movie with me in it and I'm 20-something and then in real life I walk in and I'm 50-something. I know it's kind of shocking, right? Shocking to me too. Well, you still look pretty. Aw, good save, kid. See ya later! You put her up to that, didn't you? I wish. And now, before we all go off to bed, who's ready for the final chapter in our fireside tale? And you know what that means? Who is going to act out our story tonight? Will it be you? You? You? - I'm... no, I'm semi-retired. - Come on. Please? I thought I was supposed to be the actress. You gotta go for it. I don't have a good feeling about this. You gotta go for it. I don't have a good feeling about this. Go have some fun. - You need to go up there. - Woo! Go Madeline! Alright! Alright. When we left off, the girls were meeting in Julia's basement to decide what to do with their find from the railroad yard. Thank you. Thank you. That was good. Alright, everyone. Time for us to say our good nights. This is nice. Car's fixed. It's beautiful here, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Thank you for bringing me here. You're welcome. How 'bout I get the car and you can take your time? Hello. Hey. Hey. Oh, wow. This is beautiful. Yeah, I think I'm over my slump. Yeah. You're leaving, aren't you? Yes. Will you be back? I don't know. I made something for you. It's a notebook. Just write down whatever comes to mind. Whatever means something to you. I think you'll figure out what you want to do next. Oh, Carl. This is... This is beautiful. Thank you. Well, I'll see you around. I'll see you around. Take care of yourself. You too. Hey. Let's do something fun. Ok. - Yeah? - Yeah. Ok, I'm... I'm a little nervous. I'm not that strong of a swimmer. Oh, don't worry. You'd hit a rock and die before you'd drown. - Really? I'm kidding. I did a river movie once. How is it you keep doing these lake and river movies if you're not that great of a swimmer? Acting, my friend. Ah. And very good stunt people. Mm-hm. Alright, what's that over there? Uh, rapid. A rapid? Oh no, we going this way. No, Madeline, I need your help. No! No, no, no. I don't know what to do. What do you need me to- Stay in the front and hold on. - Like this? - Yes. Oh, my gosh! Alright, stay down and hold on. You trust me? No! Alright, let's go! Ahhhhhhh!!!!!! Here we go! I'm not a great swimmer! You got this, Madeline! Well, we did it. You did great. So this is what you wanna do, huh? Drag neophytes like me down a river? Yeah, I mean I'd like to think bigger. I want a place in the mountains where I can have my own wilderness retreat. Completely unplug, just people in nature. I actually, last summer, got to do it professionally for the first time. Guiding people through the Grand Canyon. That's where I met... Oh! Do tell. You already know way too much about me. Come on. Um, yeah. That's where I met Emily. And we had a lot of fun together and I was completely in love. And she was amazing. What happened? She found somebody more amazing. Yeah, and that hurts, I know. So they found a lump in my breast and I have to have a biopsy in New York. Well, they're so great with stuff like that now. I'm sure it's nothing. Yeah, my... my mother died of breast cancer. But that was years ago. Everything's super advanced now. What happened to your mother won't happen to you. And what about your mother? Um, yeah, I had one. Oh, ok, good. 'Cause I just assumed you were raised by a pack of wolves. Yeah, we just don't talk anymore. Why not? Because when I got back from the Grand Canyon trip I told her that I didn't finish my last year of college. You dropped out of school? I put it on hold. Yeah, but that was like a year ago. What do you have to show for it except dragging my soggy pants down a river? Ok, now you sound like my mother. Oh really? Well, how's this? Finish school. What were you thinking? Man, I bet she was mad. Yeah, she was. But I was so upset about Emily that I couldn't even talk about school. Or anything, really, so, I left. And you two haven't spoken in all this time. Nope. Listen, I had my mother 40 years before she died and there's not a day that goes by where I didn't wish I could just pick up the phone and talk to her. Yeah, well that's your story, not mine. You're 24. You don't know anything. Ok, I loved my mom and I was devoted to my mom and maybe you don't feel the same way about yours. But, I'm telling you kid, when you're my age, time just runs through your fingers like water. You think you have forever, but you don't. You need to fix this. Alright, let's go. Hey, where are we now? Uh, Illinois. And what's after that? Indiana. Are you just pretending to read that map? Ok, calm down. Where are we exactly? Right there. Ok. So then we're going to Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus... My mom lives in Columbus. Columbus, Ohio? Is that strange to you? Yeah, because I thought you grew up in the mountains. I went to college in Montana, grew up in Columbus. You wanna stop by and see her? No. No, no, we talked about this. My mom and I don't get along. Plus we need to get you to New York. We have days to spare. If you wanna go by, we can- No, I just don't want to. Ok? Oh! I've been here before and the burgers are crazy good. Ah, ok. Mm! Right? So good. Mmm! Oh, yeah. Mmmm!!! Oh, wow. Mmmm!!! When's the last time you had a burger? Mm-mm-mm. Fifteen years ago? Mmmhmm. Madeline, why? Mm-mm-mm. The whole actress thing? Mmmhmm. Yeah, but that doesn't mean you don't have any burgers. Right, I'll stop talking. Enjoy. Mmmm!!! Mmmm!!! Wooooooo! Mm! Mmm!!! So, you're afraid of flying? I'm not afraid of flying. I just had a very bad experience on a plane once and I don't want to fly ever again. Ever again? Well, not for now. What if you could do it while on the ground? What? Just, hear me out. Put your hand outside the window. Just like this. Feel the breeze on your hand and it kind of feels like you're flying in a way. Ok. Is it a nice feeling? It is a nice feeling. Do you feel scared? No. Are you kind of flying on the ground? I'm kind of flying on the ground. ♪ Suddenly I see ♪ ♪ suddenly I see ♪ ♪ This is what I wanna be ♪ ♪ Suddenly I see ♪ ♪ suddenly I see ♪ ♪ Why the hell it means so much to me ♪ Suddenly I see ♪ ♪ This is what I wanna be ♪ ♪ Suddenly I see ♪ ♪ suddenly I see ♪ ♪ I feel like walking the world ♪ like walking the world ♪ ♪ And you can hear she's a beautiful girl ♪ She's a beautiful girl ♪ ♪ She fills up every corner ♪ ♪ like she's born in black and white ♪ She likes to leave you hanging on a wire ♪ Suddenly I see ♪ ♪ suddenly I see ♪ ♪ This is what I wanna be ♪ ♪ Suddenly I see ♪ I'm starting to feel kind of tired so maybe we should go back to that motel that we passed earlier. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Let's spoil ourselves. Really? Yup. There is probably a really nice hotel about 40 miles from here. Let's spoil ourselves. My treat. I actually have a treat for you. Happy belated birthday. What? I'm sure it's not like any of the gifts that you usually get, but... No way, Sarah. Oh. Oh, I love it! The road trip pen! Maybe you can use it next time you're reading your next big script. Thank you so much. Yeah. You can listen to whatever you want on the radio. Thank you. Ok. I like this. Me too. I like that song. Ok. I can rock with that. ♪ It's far from over, ♪ See? Don't you feel better? I've never had a manicure before, let alone a pedicure. You're welcome. That driving is exhausting.

Some old alley cat I should have kicked out a long time ago. So you're not married? No. Ever been married? No. Any kids? That's a yes or no question, Madeline. Oh. I had a daughter. I gave her up for adoption when I was 19. Oh, wow, I... But nobody knows this, not even Katie. Don't you dare tell her. She lives in New Jersey and she wants to meet me. Are you going to see her? No. Hey, did you call your mom to tell her that we're gonna come and see her? No, because we're not. Well, don't you think she wants to know where you are? No. No. And enough about my mom. What about your mom? What was your mom like? My mother and father were wonderful people. They were high school sweethearts. But, my mother's parents didn't approve. Spent so much time in the movies it was like their secret meeting place. But they were in love and when they got married, my mother's parents never spoke to her again. Then they had me that same year. My mother poured all her aspirations into me. College, career, stability. And when I started making movies, my mom and dad were at the front row of every single theatre that any movie I had played in. They were just over the moon at my success. Sarah, be careful giving up on people that you love. They don't come along that often. Why don't you want to see your daughter? Because I'm scared. Guilt-ridden. Heartbroken. It's... It's like it happened yesterday. It's just so clear and painful. Year after year after year. Hello? Hey, Mom. It's me, Sarah. Hey! Don't go so fast. Those are expensive bags. Good morning. Talked to my mom last night. You did? Yep. And we're having dinner at her place tonight. And it's annoying, but she's a big fan. Well, she's only human. Yeah, well, just don't be yourself and be nice. You know your mom is going to love me. Mmmhmm. Seat belts! Thank you. This is it. It's so charming. Oh! There you are! Oh, look at you! Look at you. - Oh, hi, honey. - Hi, Mom. Welcome. Mom, this is... Oh, I know who Ms. Ellis is. Please call me Madeline. Ok, Madeline. Well, I'm sure Sarah's told you that I've seen all your movies and all your TV shows. Well, actually she hasn't, but that is very sweet of you, Ms... Liz, please. Call me Liz. Um... Well, um, so Sarah, you and I will bunk up because I have a treadmill in your sister's old room and then you can have Sarah's room. Madeline doesn't want to stay, Mom. Oh yeah, I'd love to stay. I am sick of hotels. Plus this is so charming. Oh. Well, thank you. It's modest, but it is home. And that's what's important. It is. I just, I... I can't believe that my daughter is driving you across the country. You can't believe it? I can't believe it but isn't it wonderful? You just never know what surprises are around the corner. True, true. Now, uh, dinner's a couple of hours away but I did, I did make a strawberry rhubarb pie. I hope you like that. Mm! Yes, I love it. And would you like to freshen up and maybe relax a bit before dinner? I think I would. Ok, honey, can you bring her bag and show her the way and then I need a little help with dinner. That's a lot of bags, isn't it? It's only half of it. You'd think she'd have an overnight bag. Yeah... so, great to be home again. - Hi. - Hi. Smells amazing in there. Well, I'm making brisket. I love your brisket. I know you do. Madeline Ellis. Yeah. How crazy is that? It's pretty crazy. You look great. So I see all the equipment on your truck. That's not for New York, is it? No, I'm going to Montana and I'm gonna try out that kayak for a company. Oh. Is that a long-term gig? No, not really. After you called last night I was so excited I could hardly sleep. I know this has to be a good visit for both of us. But, I do need to talk to you. You know I love you, you know I only want the best for you. Which is why I'm hoping you've changed your mind and you're thinking of going back to college. There's just so many things I want to do, Mom. I want to start an ecotour company. Honey, a business degree is perfect for that kind of thing. Just one more year and then you've got it. And it gives you such a huge advantage for the future. Madeline was giving me grief about it too. Well, I'm sure she was because she knows the value of a college degree. I'll think about it, Mom. So, how long have you two known each other? Dinner's really good, Mom. She's right, it's delicious. Oh, well, I'm sure brisket is a little boring for you. Oh, no. It makes me very nostalgic. My mom made an amazing brisket too. - Oh, she did? Really? - Mm-hm. Everything worth knowing I learned from my mom. She was responsible for my success and I'll forever be grateful to her. That's lovely to hear. I have to admit, I'm a little jealous that you're getting to spend so much quality time with my daughter. Well, quality might be an overstatement. It wasn't a conscious decision. One out of desperation, really. Um, you mentioned there was pie, may I... Oh! Yes, it's right over there. Help yourself. Thank you. Honey. Is there something you want to talk about? Maybe. Well, we certainly have a lot to catch up on. I know you were upset last time you were here. And I know it wasn't just about school. Oh, and you never wanted to talk to me. Well, I tried. You never wanted to talk to me. Look... I know you think I'm old and I don't know anything. But, I've had my heart broken and I know you had your heart broken too. You've just always been so fearless about everything. And I want you to be that fearless about who you love. And if that's a woman, it's fine. It is. I just want you to be happy again, baby girl. I miss you, Mom. Oh, this pie! Oooh this pie! Oh! That's a good sign. Woo, Mama! What you put in this pie?! You know that, right? Thank you. Oh, my goodness. Drive carefully. Call me when you get to New York. I will. It was such a pleasure meeting you, Madeline. Oh, you too, Liz. Thanks for the accommodations. Best B&B in Columbus. Bye. Bye, Mom. ♪ Sun will set late in the day ♪ She set across the open road ♪ Only doing free, can be another way ♪ We won't stop until we hit the coast ♪ Time may roll ♪ ♪ And the wind may blow ♪ But you got to take 'er easy to get along Well, home sweet, haven't been here in two-and-a-half years, home. Look at this view. This is amazing. Yeah. Bought it for my parents when I was 30. So, five years ago? Now you're catching on. I miss this place. Hey, make sure you call your mom to tell her you arrived safely. I will. Oh, Katie called to say that she stocked up your kitchen. I'm gonna go see my doctor in the morning. Oh, good. That's... that's great. Might be a couple days before I get the results from the test, so I was wondering, uh... You know, I've never been to New York before. I was thinking maybe I could stick around and see the sights. If that's cool with you. That's definitely cool with me. Great, thanks. No, thank you. Alright, you want to see your room? Follow me. I think you're gonna love it. Ms. Williams? Really? Ms. Williams? Everyone knows it's you. I'm sorry, Ms. Williams, but it's just you for this procedure. I'll be here when you get back. That was quick. How did it go? Fine. When do you get the results? Tomorrow. He's rushing the tests. Thank goodness he's a fan. That's it. You can't stay in this apartment. You need sunshine and exercise. Come on. I don't want to. It's him. Hello, Dr. Moore. Yes. Yes. Oh. Oh, man. Thank you so much. Thank you, Dr. Moore. Goodbye. It's benign. Test came back negative. Madeline! I told you it was nothing. Want to go for a walk with me? I want to show you something. Come on. There it is. This bench is dedicated to the memory of Ken and Dorothy Ellison and their enduring love for each other. It's beautiful. Sit. My parents loved this spot. They came here all the time. My father died two years after my mother. I think from a broken heart. You know my mother always said, "life is who you love and who loves you back." And it's kind of terrifying to look up and realize, at my age, there's nobody in my life who fits that description. I mean, I would like to spend the rest of my life with people I love and who love me back. I think that would be a really worthy tribute to my parents. Hey, Madeline. Hey, I thought you said you were going running. I ran, now I'm back. Well, I'm having company. You need to run again. Run again? Madeline, what? - Yeah, just go. - Go where? Why? Who's coming over? Come on, who is it? My daughter. Oh, you're right. I need to go running again. No, it's too late. Just stay here, ok? Yes? There's a Rose Donner to see you, Ms. Ellis? Ok, yes, send her up. Thank you. I don't know why, but somehow I expected to see a child come out of that elevator. Isn't that funny? No. No, not really. Hi. I'm Rose. Madeline. Please, come in. Have a seat. You have a beautiful home. Thank you. You look like me. I know. I've seen a lot of your movies. Really? Yes. I mean, I didn't know you were who you are then. That must have been quite a shock. Surprising, yes. What do you do for a living? I am a doctor. Oh! Wow, that... that's great. That makes me so proud. Oh, I'm sorry. That's... that's so presumptuous. As if I had anything to do with your accomplishments. I'm sorry. It's alright. This is a unique situation for both of us. So, my mother died last year, my adoptive mother. Oh, I'm so sorry. Was she a good mother? Yes. We were very close. She was a wonderful woman. I really appreciate you meeting with me. When I began this, I didn't know if I would ever find you or if you would ever want to meet me. But after my mother passed away, it somehow seemed more important, you know? Yeah. I would think that it would. When my mother died it was like... Losing a big part of me. I want you to know, I mean, I think it's important that you understand the situation I was in. I was barely 19. I had just started college on a scholarship. We didn't have much money and I made a mistake with a boy I thought I loved. I couldn't have taken care of you then. I just couldn't have. After I had you, they took you away right away. That's what we had discussed. But that night, when I was resting, I asked the nurse to bring you to me. You were so quiet. You hardly cried the whole time I was holding you. You were content and that's when I knew. Everything was gonna be alright. You were gonna be alright. Then we must have fallen asleep together and... when I woke up, you were gone. And that was the last time that I saw you. But I never stopped thinking about you. Every single day. Every day. Have you had a nice life? I have. I'm very content with my life. - You need more coffee? - No, I'm fine. - How are you feeling today? - Fine. 'Cause yesterday was kind of a big deal. Yes, it was. You gonna see her again? Yes, we will. Really? That's amazing. You know, Madeline, you're kind of starting to show your age. I mean, why are you reading the newspaper on newspaper? So, I can do that. I talked to my mom this morning. Told her that I was going back to college in the fall. I knew you'd do that. That's smart. And here you go. Paid in full. Thank you, Madeline. And there's this. What's this? Uh, just a little seed money for your eco-resort or whatever tree hugging moniker you're calling it. It's like an IOU until after you've graduated. Madeline, I don't even know how to thank you. Name a boat after me. And speaking of deals, seems that nobody's in the market for an old movie theatre, so I got a fabulous deal on that little place in the mountains. You got that theatre. Yep. And that old charming house. You want to come watch a movie with me in about a year? Absolutely, yes. I'm thinking about starting a film festival and encouraging young talent. What do you think of that? That sounds great.
