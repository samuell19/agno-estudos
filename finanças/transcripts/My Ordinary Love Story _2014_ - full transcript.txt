- The bride is ready, sir. - Oh... I see. This is the song that was playing when we first met. Remember? You told the taxi driver to lower the volume. You're still mad? I'm not cheating on you. I only want to show you the best side of me. Don't you see? This woman and this man are in love. The woman is 30 years old, her name, Park Eunjin. The man is 32, his name, Kim Hyeonseok. Though I'm not sure what happened, the two must have had a fight. When it comes to love, there is joy, but also sadness. Furthermore, man and woman do not always see eye to eye. Today, Eunjin is about to a strange incident. [My Ordinary Love Story] Which one do you like? This one? No! It has to be this one! Oh... Is that so? Of course! Look at your place! It won't go with your interior. We need something minimal and simple. Yes, we should go with something more... Antique! I feel like we could have at least one antique item. For this apartment, we have to go with this! Even flea markets don't sell this kind of stuff! Come on! - What? - Fine. Let's go with this one. This one. No, not this one! Seriously! Okay. Let's get this. I'm going to get this one, okay? Okay, okay. - You mean it? - Yes. If we get this, we can try all positions you want on me. You brushed your teeth? Well, we had garlic with our pork lettuce wraps. It smells nasty. I ate them with you. I smell nasty too. It's fine. I'll make it go away. Uh, hold on. I'll go brush my teeth. No... I'm... Just give me a second. Seriously? This is about timing! Just a second. [I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself. D.H. Lawrence] This is no fun. That's much better. 016-312-2059? Why so many? Are they from his boss? [Honey, what time are you coming over?] Honey...? What are you doing? Tada! Isn't this much better? I think I should go home. But I brushed my teeth. I'd better spend more time with my parents before the wedding. Okay, then. Don't come out. I can go home alone. Why? I'll drive you home. No, it's okay. Stay home and rest. Okay, then. You're not asking me to stay? Good night. I should not believe men. That brings back old memories. [School bully] My first boyfriend. I was eighteen and rebellious. I thought this was my first love. But.. Didn't you say this was your first time? It is my first time. Girls usually bleed the first time, but you're not bleeding. [College student] My second time, I met him in college on a blind date. We were a campus couple, but then he joined the army. I even visited him at the training camp and waited for him for two years... At a cheap bar near base camp and became sergeant. Bastard... [Professor] After I got dumped, I found a tender and mature man. He was my professor. He gave me an A+on my thesis. It was perfect. But... He didn't tell me he was married. She pulled out so much of my hair that I still have bald spots. [Rocker] The fourth one was in an indie rock band. He was broke and he was younger than me, but he had a pure soul. Being around him almost made me feel younger. I even gave him money to buy a guitar. Who's that lady? But kids are so irresponsible. Cut! [Movie director] Let's continue after eating! Next, I met a pretty successful movie director. I visited him at work, which was fun. He was a true artist. It was an intellectual romance, which was what I needed at the time, but... [Actress 'Kim **' admits director '***' is her boyfriend] Then he never answered my calls. I was so mad that I decided to stay single for the rest of my life. [Eunjin's mom, housewife, 58] Like you could live alone. You always whine about feeling lonely. But when I turned 29, I started feeling restless. My friends were married, having kids, and bragging about their husbands. So I decided to get back into the game. [Boss] Office romances are a pain, but I endured. I was really tired of dating. I wanted to find a nice husband, a nice family, and live in a nice house. But... I'm actually engaged. Why is she standing there like an idiot? Come and help me! Did you meet that bastard again? Dad, it's not 'bastard.' It's Hyeon-seok! He's going to be your son-in-law! He's not my son-in-law yet! You'll never know until you have the marriage certificate in your hands. Mom's right. Is Eun-gyeol home? [Marine Corps] [Little brother Eun-gyeol unemployed, 25] - Oh, You scared me! - Give me your phone. Don't you know how to knock? Give it to me. I was chatting with someone! So hysterical! You came into my room. Hello? Is anyone there? What's wrong? Something happened? Hey, this girl says you're annoying. Damn it! Don't go through my texts! It's been 6 month since you were discharged. Girls hate stuff like this. Especially when you brag about being from the marines. Get a job already, will ya? It's not like you have a job! You're such an idiot! You piece of... Everything seemed fine when I first met Hyun-Seok. But it was the day I broke up with my boss. I don't know what to say to you. I'm sorry, Eunjin. This is so sudden. But didn't you see this coming? It's like what everyone says. There're girls to get married, and girls to date. You understand, right? I don't actually. Then what? Did you really think we would get married? Come on now. You were just messing around too, right? I don't care about getting married, but my parents keep pushing for it. You're pretty and nice. I'm sure guys will be lining up for you. I really don't want to see you go. I wish I could keep seeing you beside me. Do you know how much this cost? Why are you being such a mess? Just be cool! Who can stay cool during a break up? Everyone becomes a mess. Do you know how much I spent on those handbags I got you? Fine. I'll keep them happily for the rest of my life. Think you're forgetting something. I'm still your boss! I'm quitting, so just worry about yourself. I'm filing for sexual harassment and telling everyone how small your penis is! If I ever see you again, I'll rip your eyes out! Got it? What a prick! Break up with him! All guys cheat! Prepare your second, third guy. You pig, are you laughing at me? Get over here! Come here! I had grilled meat for lunch and dinner. Don't eat so much meat. That's why you're getting fat. To Gwacheon, please. I can't go there. Sinsa-dong, please! Oh, Sinsa-dong? Okay. Get in. That's messed up! Oh no. At this hour? It's too late to go all the way there. Are you refusing the customer? You know that's illegal. I'll go if you give me $10 extra. I'm going to call you in and report you! Then just give me $5 extra. Taxi drivers these days! Where'd my phone go? Come here. Hold on! Taxi drivers need to make a living too. I need to make a living. I have to go home now. Ew, you reek. What's the number? Oh come on! [Delete] Why did I take so many photos? He looks like a pervert. Excuse me. Are you going to Gwacheon? Yes. I'm headed that way. Do you want to share a taxi? We can save on fare. Sure. But don't try to talk to me! I'm having a bad day, so I want to go home quietly. You understand what I mean, right? This one time, he wanted to have sex at the office, so he made me work overtime! Oh... That's upsetting. Plus, he hates wearing condoms. He says he can't feel anything. Is that true for guys? How is it any different? Can't get it up? Miss, don't do this. Please stop drinking. Sir, can you turn that down? Hey! Taxi drivers... always pretend that they didn't hear anything. It's so annoying. He must hear us. They're right in front of us. Well, have you ever been to America? The States? No. Why do you ask? There taxi drivers are boxed in glass to keep apart from passengers. There's just a slot where you pay money. Like a visitation room at a prison. I think I've seen it in the movies. - Right - Yeah So? I want Korean taxis to be like that. Wouldn't it be impersonal? My father was hit by a taxi when I was little. - Really? - Yes. After my dad died, my mom got sick while working hard. In the end, both of them passed away. That's so sad... That's why when I see taxi drivers act rudely, I just want to kill them. I'm sorry. I hope I wasn't being rude. I had no idea about... What? My parents? I just made it up to make the taxi driver feel bad. What? My parents are alive and well. I see... Good night. Wait. Here you go. Oh, right. Thank you. What's this? My business card. I don't have anything to pay back. It's not like that. I just... Can I have your number? Are you asking me out? I think we have something here. Just because I got dumped, and I was crying in a taxi. So you think that I'm an easy girl? Is that why you lied to me? Definitely not. If you're not interested, you don't have to give the number. It's not like that. Uh, hold on. I was taught that all boys are bad, but since I was rude being drunk, I'll give you my number. This number... What's your name? Park Eun-jin. My name is Kim Hyeon-seok. That's how it all started. We watched movies, go shopping, and ate together. At first I thought he was a little slow... clumsy... But it was okay. Actually, I liked that. He listened to me, had eyes only for me. He was the guy I wanted. The only weird thing about him was that he loved going to the zoo. I wasn't into it. But it was close to my house, so we'd go together. Why do you like it here? Animals are always true to their nature. They never put up a front. Sometimes I just envy them. I'm not a fan. Why not? Look at that lion's eyes. They look sullen and out of focus. It's always lived in captivity, so it must forget its nature long ago. You think it's ever gone on a proper hunt? I think you're right. About what? This is just a zoo. Should we move to Africa? Africa? No. Africa really scares me. So you're okay with moving in with me. Why do you button your shirt up like this? Doesn't it get hot? You're beautiful. Why do you love me? Because you're honest and innocent. Me? Innocent? That's really important though. Most people have two sides. One that they want to show and the other that they want to hide. But you don't, and that's why I like you. Look. The good answer is "You're so beautiful". Is that so hard? Sorry. It's fine. Just don't say things like that when you meet my parents. A year passed. I'm almost thirty now... Why doesn't he know what I want yet? How about that one? Don't you think it'd look good on me? Should we go in and see? Oh, our dinner reservation. Let's go. We're late. It won't take long... What is it? You don't want to? It's not that. We like each other and we live together. Do we have to announce that to the world wearing that stuff? Were you saying that to me? No... it's not that. If you don't want to, just say it! Damn! Damn? A wedding dress upsets you that much? Then let's not get married! Why are we together? What are you looking at? Can't you hear me? What are you doing? This is embarrassing! Just wait. Why? - Can't find it? - No. I think it got washed down far away. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't even know. Is your hand okay? I wanted to make it really special. I'm sorry. I'm the one who's sorry. I have a really bad temper. I was just so mad... Eunjin. There's something I want to tell you. Should I tell you later? Say it. Is he proposing? I'm a real jerk... Hello? Hi, it's me. Thinking now, this isn't the first time. [Soyeong, 29, Police] Remember when he went on 3-day business trip? He kept his phone off the whole time. It is suspicious. When did he start two-timing? Am I his second? You're just over-reacting. Because you've been cheated on so many times before? You're probably the only girl who's ever been dumped by a guy in the army. Never bring that up! He doesn't have what it takes to cheat on you, he's a serious guy. Yeah! He's seriously cheating on me! And you know what else is weird? He's never introduced me to any of his colleagues. You said he isn't close to his colleagues. What about that text? The one with the hearts and stuff? Isn't that suspicious? How am I going to catch him? You really frustrate me. Just google his number. Some novices make simple mistakes. Really? This is the Italian direct imported sofa used in the store. I paid more than 3 million won when I bought it, but I sell it for 700,000 won at a low price. It's as good as new. If you come and take it yourself, I'll take out 50,000 won! Now. A lot of male offenders think that female police officers are a joke. When they threaten you with a weapon... Hit it away! Block! And twist his arm! Now, when he attacks from behind, use your foot to... Come out! Right now! Stomp with your foot! And do a headbutt! Lift your arm up! Hit him in the stomach! What? A sexy bar madam? Its so ridiculous. I searched up the number and found a job posting for a female bartender. [Wanted: A nice looking woman between the age of 20 to 25 years to work at Hermes.] [Experience preferred. Please call.] Isn't that insane? Do you have sex with him? I haven't been in good shape lately, so not as often as before, but still, twice a week! - And there aren't any problems? - None! But you're always the one who has to ask. Are you going to sleep? Come here. Come on, let's do it. What is it now? I was just thinking about that one guy from our high school. Hey! Do you want to die? So what are you going to do now? I'm going to meet her. I need to see her in person. But you're not even sure. Why are you so bad at hiding your feelings? Guys hate girls who nag! You think this is something I can hide? Besides, I'm going to do it in secret. You just said you couldn't hide it. Why would you do it in secret? Just ask him about it. That's your problem. It's like paying games. If you know everything already, then why are you still single? I'm single by choice. What are you going to do when you meet her? Pull her hair out? No, I told her I'm buying her sofa. Hello, I'm calling about the sofa you posted. I want to see it in person. When should I come by? Today? Please help me. Help you with what? Come with me. Oh, man. You're a police officer. It's your duty to help citizens. I'll buy you dinner. I want tripe. But I can't eat that. - I'm not going. - Okay, tripe it is. It's that one? [Hermes Bar] I'm speechless. I think they went out of business. Let's go in! Hello? No one's here. Why would you bring me here? You're unbelievable. Make sure you ask him later. - Be quiet! - What...? Are you here for the sofa? [Fake, Copy, bought in cheap mart] Wait... [Hermes scarf] Is that real? Hmm... Anyway. My man is cheating on me with this woman? Which of you called me yesterday? She did. I'm her friend. Are you Ms. Jeong who's selling the couch? Yes. I'll show it to you. Right this way. Come here. Had I known you were coming, I would've cleaned up. Come here. It's this one. Take a look. Isn't it pretty? This looks similar. It's like brand new. My boyfriend and I were the only ones who ever sat here. Do you live here? Yes. I sold my house. It's not bad living here alone. Business must be slow. Yes. My husband died when I was young. I had to survive. But I had no skills, so I opened a bar. So, you're closing it down? I guess there weren't any customers anyhow. The dealer is taking the rest, but this couch is too nice to just give away. You can lie down on it and it won't hurt your back at all. It's that nice. Your boyfriend will love it. It's very soft. So you did lie down on it! Didn't you? I'm really into mature women like you. Come here. So? Do you want to take it now? I'll think about it and then give you a call. Are you selling that elliptical machine? Huh? Oh, that machine? Are you interested? Then tell me now. I'm going to Macau with my boyfriend tomorrow. What? You're going to Macau? Yes. You're going on a trip with your boyfriend? Yes. We met recently. He's 9 years younger than me. 9 years younger... How old are you? How old do I look? How old do you look? Mid-thirties? Oh, thirties? Thank you. I'm forty-one. Then she's nine-years older than Hyeon-Seok. Did you meet your boyfriend here? He was one of my regulars. It just sort of happened. We were friends at first, but we found out we wanted each other. He's been helping me sell this bar. I'm going to start a new life with him. Oh, I can't believe I'm telling you all this. How embarrassing. Do you girls have boyfriends? I do, but I'm breaking up with him. Why? I think he's cheating on me. That's terrible. Right? Before you break up, make sure you're right. If you really love him, you might lose a great guy over a complete misunderstanding. Nobody is perfect. It's about finding the person who's perfectly imperfect for you. Mind your own business, woman. Anyway, you should meet someone before you get lonely. I'm hungry. Why aren't you eating? So that bastard is going to Macau with her? Is he crazy? Why didn't you ask her for his name? We could be mistaken. He might be buying that couch for you. Then what about the text? A lot of women who worked in bars send texts like that out of habit. Whose side are you on? I just felt sorry for her. Something was wrong with her leg. I'm sure there's a story behind it. What's wrong with her leg? You didn't see? No! [Tripe restaurant] It is him. Why? [I'm going to Hong Kong tomorrow on business. Shall we meet later?] Macau is in Hong Kong, right? What time is it? [Tripe restaurant] I'm going to murder him at his office. I can't hold it in any longer. Let's go! Uh, do I have to come along? Of course! You can't go home now! Hurry up! Is this the place? Yes! I'm sure. Follow me. It's your first time here too! What are you going to do? I'm thinking. I'm going humiliate him. Think carefully. You don't have any evidence. What do you mean I don't\have hard evidence? Then do I have to walk in on them having sex? Don't be so crude. This is crude. Bastards who cheat deserve to have their dicks cut off with scissors! Hyeon-Seok is dead today. Eunjin, did you get my text? Yes. You're going to Hong Kong? When? I'm catching a flight tomorrow night. I want to see you tonight, but I'm busy with work, so I'm not sure if I can. I'm only going for 4 days So where are you right now? I'm in my office. I'm getting ready to leave with my boss. Hold on. You're not going anywhere to until after you see me. Where are you? I'm getting ready to leave with my boss. Why did you hang up? Your boss? Yes. He's name is Kim Min-su. I told you already. He's a terrible person. He's coming with me to Hong Kong and I'm already mad because I think he's going to drink every night. - Hello? - I'll call you back. Are you Mr. Kim Min-su? Yes. May I ask who's calling? Are you Mr. Kim Hyeon-seok's boss? Who? Kim Hyeon-seok. Where is his desk? How did you get here? Who are you? We're the police. We're investigating Kim Hyeonseok for fraud. We'd like you to cooperate with our investigation. This is our business card, but I've never seen this man. Really? But he's been working here for a year. I've been working here for 10 years, and I've never heard his name before. There was a temp named Kim Hyeon-seok who worked for us a year ago, but he quit after a month. So this guy is lying about working at our company? Who is this guy? Wake up! Do you know what time it is? Get up, wash up, and eat! It's practically lunch time already. Don't you dare ask me for favors after you get married. Time to eat! Wake up! Instead of drinking every night, you should be helping out your mother. You don't know how to do anything! Where's Eun-gyeol? Your dad took him to a marine corps conference. That won't get him a job. That's just a waste of time. Mom... What? When did you first feel like you knew everything about dad? Why are you asking me that? Just because. Hmm... About 15 years after the wedding? 15 years? Yes, it took a while. But think about it. You fall in love and you get married. Still we were strangers before marriage. You have to have kids and go through troubles to become family. Mom, has dad ever cheated on you? How should I know? And if he did, why would I tell anyone? You've never even suspected him of it? You've never felt deceived? No. Then, do you still love dad? What are you saying? Did dad ever tell you he loved you, when dating? Those are just sugarcoated words that don't mean a thing. I've never heard them before. Not even from Hyeon-seok? Nope. But you've never said them either, right? Men are supposed to say it first. If you love him, just say it. You never give, but only know how to take. You're so selfish. I got it from my mom. I can't believe you said that. - Just eat up - Stop it! Be good while I'm still with you. Hello? - I have hard evidence. - What? I got CCTV footage near the bar. Look. Here. Isn't that Hyeon-seok's car? Sure looks like it. It's him, right? That bastard! No problems, sir! Hey! What did you just call me? You can't bring your friends here. I'm a victim! I really am! Damn it Sit down! I did some research on Hyeon-seok with the information you gave me. You said he majored Korean Literature in Korea University right? Yeah He's not on the alumni list. I also called his previous workplace. They said Hyeon-seok never worked there. Did you lend him any money? - $5,000? - Oh! Why? He said he'd pay me back. He always pays me back. That's what professional con artists do to gain your trust. And then later, they steal everything from you. Do you know his email address? Yes. He lost all his money in the stock market. Including my $5,000? Probably also including that bar lady's money. Answer it! Hey! You didn't answer my calls. What happened last night? I wasn't feeling very well, so I went to bed early. You swindler. Really? Are you okay now? Yes. I wanted to see you last night. I'm leaving for the airport from work. It's okay. Have a nice trip. I'll call you right away when I arrive You're dead. What did he say? He's going on a business trip. Give me that! Hello? We were there to see the couch. Can we drop by to buy it today? What? Okay. We'll go right away. She says she's going to the airport with her boyfriend. Bastards. You're dead now! Both of you! When are you buying me tripe? After it's all over. We should've bought it for me last time. Let me make a phone call. You only eat what you want to eat. Answer the phone. Make it stop. Marine Park Eun-gyeol! Please excuse me! That was from his phone? Nice. Why did you call? Really? You'll buy me grilled meat? Okay! I'll buy you grilled meat. Don't forget to bring your car. That car is too dangerous. It needs to get checked. I bought you that car! Bring it, or I'll kill you! Is your brother still unemployed? Yes. But he used to be in the marines, so he should be useful. He was in the marines? Didn't I tell you? No. You always called him a loser. You said he needed to join the army. But he becomes even bigger loser after the army. Wake up! Oh, no! What's this? Eun-jin! Where were you? The bathroom. Is he your brother? Hi. I'm Park Eun-gyeol. Hi. I'm Kim So-yeong. I've waited 25 years to hold this hand in mine. Ms. Kim So-yeong, I've been saving my virginity for you! It's all yours! - I can't watch this! - Why kick me? Go get the car! Hurry up! How many kilos can you bench press? Up to 50. Amazing! Do you want to do crossfit with me? There's a gym near my place, but I hate going by myself. Why aren't you in your uniform? I got changed after I finished my shift. Police uniforms are awesome. The marine corps' fatigues are pretty cool too. Wow. Most women call them uniforms, but you called them fatigues. You've been my sister's friend since high school, so why haven't I seen you before? Out of all of her friends, I've never met a gorgeous girl like you. Oh, stop lying. A marine cannot tell a lie. Shut up! Please. When are we eating? Later. Later? Do you know what time it is? It's almost midnight. - He's here, he's here! - It's him! Isn't that my brother-in-law? Who are you calling your brother-in-law? Did I marry him? If you say that again, I'm going to kill you. What are you going to do? Did you two fight? When he comes out with her, grab him. If he runs, you have to run after him and grab him, got it? - He cheated on you? - Shut up! So what kind of supplements do you take? Mega Whey Protein's the best. Really? I think it's a bit too sweet. Chicken Breast Muscle Mania's pretty good, too. Hey! Be quiet! Here they come! They are going on a trip together. We caught them. Should we grab them? Wait for the woman. Wait, isn't that the couch? Shouldn't we help him out? - She hasn't come out yet! - Forget it! Aren't you supposed to be catching a flight? How did you find out about this place? You think that's what's important right now? Are you happy that you fooled me? Marry a bastard like you? I must have been out of my mind! This is a misunderstanding. Yeah, right! Hello. I'm very sorry that you had to see this. Don't apologize to me. Apologize to Eun-jin. I have to tell that woman that I was seeing you! Get get her! Where is she? Is she inside? Who? What? What are you asking me for? The woman you're going to Macau with! Aren't you embarrassed? You dirty bastard! Where is she! Yes! She's all packed! Where is she? Hey! Where is she? The bar owner? She went to China or Macau or something. Yes! She was going with you! To Macau! With me? That's what you were thinking? Me and that lady? Unbelievable! What about your job? Didn't you say you work for a stationery company? Are you moonlighting? I guess you know everything now. You're right. I don't work there anymore. I used to, but only for a short while. I'm doing this because my friend told me I could make good money cleaning. So why did you lie to me? Because I was embarrassed. When I first met you, I didn't have a job. But I couldn't tell you that, and I gave you my old business card. It was in my wallet, so I just handed it over. I felt really bad from the start. So you tricked me? You've been lying to me this whole time! I was going to tell you the truth once I made enough money. I thought you'd break up with me if you found out. I was afraid. I didn't want you to think I was a loser. That's all. You expect me to believe that? It's the truth. And there's something else I didn't tell you. After I doubled and tripled my money in the stock market, I was going to propose. But I lost all the money that I borrowed you. Aw, man. How did I let this happen? You idiot! Did you think I was trying to marry you for money? Is that what you think of me? I'm really sorry. I don't know what to say. I don't even have a good excuse. But I really didn't cheat on you. I just wanted to treat you right. It's fine! Tell me everything you've been hiding from me right now! Afterwards, I'll decide whether to forgive you or not! Just tell me what you've been hiding from me! I love you. Can you give me one more chance? Eun-jin, get a hold of yourself! Do you believe this con artist? Mr. Kim Hyeon-seok, is that really your name? It is. Do you want to see my ID? Get up. If you lie to me one more time, it'll really be over. Understand? It'll really be over! I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... Oh, I'm starving! When are they coming back? Let's go. What about Eun-jin? What's she doing with him? It's a bad romance. She's ruining her own life. Aren't you hungry? Do you like tripe? Tripe... I love it. There's a 24-hour place near here. Let's go. What about Eun-jin and Hyeon-seok? They have a lot to talk about. Let's just go by ourselves. I think I let him off too easily. I should've tortured him for a month before I forgave him. Damn it Then why did you talk on the phone with her so much? Ms. Jeong Yunhui? To haggle with her. A lot of businesses that close down have lots of nice stuff. That's why I got the couch. It looked like the one you wanted. I thought it'd be perfect for our living room. You wanted that couch for our place? I'll have to clean it first. It was in a bar. Wow, this is nice! Eat up! Finally, I get to eat tripe. So, do you work out at home? Yeah. I used to work out at a gym, but I started getting night shifts, so now I work out at home. Oh, it must be nice living alone. I have a stair master at home, and I was thinking about getting a stationary bike, I found a nice one in that bar. She's selling it? I was going to ask the bar owner, but because of your sister, I couldn't. She said she was going to sell it. Then let's go and get it. We can't do that. Why not? She's selling it. Now's our best chance. Just put it in my car. Eun-jin, I'm going to the restroom, so take the nozzle out when it's done. Oh, right. My phone. What? Who is he going to call? Damn it. What are you doing? Huh? Oh, this is the couch we saw in that magazine, right? Yes, it is. Isn't it pretty? Yes. I just wanted to check it. - Shall we go then? - Okay. - Where's the light switch? - Ew, what's that smell? Can you point that here? Okay. It's not here. This way. Okay. Here? It was here? Yes. She must have sold it. I guess so. Ew, why is it so sticky? That was a waste of time. Let's go out for some beer and fried chicken. Well... What's that suitcase for? Oh, that? I stuffed some things from the bar in there. Like coffee maker and other small appliances. Stuff I can sell. Hi. I'm in Hyeon-seok's car. We're on our way home. What are you saying? Is this a joke? Why are you doing this? Okay. I'll call you back when I get home. Okay Who was it? So-yeong? Did something happen? No. She's eating tripe with Eun-gyeol. She wanted to know if I wanted to join. That sounds good. I like tripe. I'm thirsty. Is there a rest stop near here? I'm not sure about a rest stop. Maybe there's a convenience store someplace. Do you want anything to drink? I'm okay. I want some caffeine. Water, coffee, and some snacks. I'm hungry. Sorry. Were you waiting long? Shall we go? Do you want to listen to some music? This is the song that was playing when we first met. Remember? You told the taxi driver to lower the volume. You're still mad? I'm not cheating on you. I only want you to see the best side of me. Stop it! You scared me. I'm sorry. You weren't answering me... I was just thinking about something. My mind is someplace else right now. Do you want to sleep over at my place? I feel like we need to talk. I can't. I... I have a headache. I want to go home and rest. We'll talk later. I bought this for you. You don't want any? What happened to your hand? It's bleeding. It is bleeding. What happened? Let's go to the hospital. No, we don't have to. I just need to put a band aid on it. You must have scraped it when you fell down. Where are we going? Oh, this is yours, right? I found it by the car. You called the bar lady. You still don't trust me. I'll turn it off. Why did you pull over? Eun-jin, did you see it? See what? What is on the couch. Did you see it? So you did. How do I look? Beautiful. Come over here. Hurry. Let's take a photo. Can we get a photo? Wait, your dress. Here. - I'm sorry. - Take it from my left side Go! One, two, three! Eun-jin, I'm sorry... I'm really sorry Eunjin! I'm sorry. Eunjin! Calm down! I was going to get the ring, but I forgot. They won't hear you. Only your throat hurts. Calm down, okay? Calm down. Whe, where are we? My house. My real house. My real house. This guy seems to have a more complicated life than what Eun-jin thought. My father dying in a car accident that wasn't a lie. Sir, there's a child here. Please slow down. But he didn't slow down. My father died in that very seat. The driver didn't help, he just stood there smoking a cigarette. Memorized that bastard's face. When my father died, everything changed in an instant. My mom, who knew no hardships in life, suddenly started working at a factory. One day, she hurt her leg at work, And got fired without any compensation. She then started working at a bar. She did it for me. We needed to survive on something. She was treated like dirt. Men abused her, stole from her, and used her. I was young, but I memorized all those bastards' faces. My mom held on for as long as she could... But one day, gave up on life. That's when I realized... The person who ruined my life... That taxi driver... The year I turned twenty, I killed that taxi driver. That was my first murder. And then, I hunted down the men who wronged my mother one by one. They deserved worse than death. When I watched men abuse women, I thought of my mother, and I couldn't help myself. Fortunately, I never got caught. And then one night, I met you. Excuse me... Eunjin, do you remember? The first day we met? You were drunk and complaining about the driver. It was so adorable. After that, I started thinking. Maybe I could live a normal life. That's why I hid things from you. You had nothing to hide, and I liked it a lot. I loved how you were so blunt and honest with me. So I wanted to keep my secrets and keep living with you. But this woman... I just wanted to get rid of her and then get on with my life... But this couch, I really did get it for you. But why did you kill her? She had nothing to do with your mom and dad. Yes, she does. She was the taxi driver's wife, the first person I killed. Maybe it was because it was my first time, but for some reason, I kept thinking about her. So I kept an eye on her, even after I became an adult. But when her husband died, her life fell apart too. She reminded me of my mom. I thought that was enough for my revenge... But it wasn't I felt like swirling around a same place I wasn't going to kill her at first. She lied when she said she was going to Macau with her boyfriend. She always says stuff like that. She's always trying to go someplace far. Who knows? She might have just said it to sell her couch as soon as possible. But it's true that she had a boyfriend. He's a gambling addict. She even opened up the bar with his money, but he lost it all to gambling. He beat her all the time. That's why she was limping all the time. He was my original target. Even though the bar was managed by her. All the paperwork was signed in that bastard's name. I was going to kill him quietly, while the bar was empty, but she saw me. And she was in love with him. It was then that I realized that if you love someone you have to give up a part of yourself. So when I was with you... But how could you kill her? What else could I do? If she found out about me, I wouldn't get to see you again. Eunjin, are you scared of me? Are you afraid of living with me? If you're scared, should we... Die together? You can't be afraid of the person you love. Dying only takes a moment. Less than a second. And my life would be meaningless without you. I know a few ways to die painlessly. This is too big. If I hit your temple with this, you'll die painlessly. Pull yourself together! Pull yourself together, Eun-jin! I, I'll help you. I'll help you live like a normal person. I'll help you. Let's live together, okay? Normal person? You think I'm a monster, too. That was a mistake. - Quickly, say something else. - Hold on. How am I going to kill myself? That's a problem. I didn't mean that. I'll try harder. I don't think I knew. I never really tried to do anything for you. I never asked you about your taste in furniture or in foods. I only ever thought about myself. I was always selfish. Right? You even hid your past from me, you were always making sacrifices for me. I'm sorry. I treated you so badly. I'll try my best from now on. I didn't know then. But the words I said was true. Hyeon-seok? Eun-jin This is... Um... My room. Not bad, right? Can you accept who I am? Really? This photo... It's nice, isn't it? Eunjin had gained Hyeonseok's trust for a brief moment. She began to consider her options. Should she accept his heart? Should she escape? Now, she has made her decision. Eun-jin! Eun-jin! Oh... Are you sure it's here? This is where they were last seen by a security camera. I called for backup, so we'll search the place. Eun-jin! - Eun-jin! - Eun-jin! Here! Here! So-yeong! Eun-gyeol! I'm here! - Eun-jin! - Eun-jin! Hold on. Can you hear that? What? Over there! - Eun-jin! - Eun-jin! I'm over here! What happened? - Let's go. Hurry up! - What happened? Are you okay? What happened? Are you okay? We can talk later. Let's go. Hurry up! Go. What's wrong with the car? Hurry up! Step on it! Step on it! Eunjin! Oh, I warned her not to go around acting like an idiot. This is breaking my heart. Just look at her face. Leave her alone! She really is out of her mind You got lucky. You were in real danger. He said he was really in love with you, but who knows? Anyway, you won't have to see him again so don't worry. They found it at his house. He used to live in that field with his parents. They said I could give this back to you. You won't have to see him again so don't worry. Excuse me.
