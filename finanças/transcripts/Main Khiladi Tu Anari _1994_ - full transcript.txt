Ivebeen watching you. for the last two hours "It's like moving with a bloody mirror! I can't even think, because of you!" You ape me! You even smoke like me! Soon Im going to quit smoking! Me too! It is a bad habit "One second,... why are you getting so angry?' Are you Damodar? What is the telephone number of your residence? Im neither interested in your films nor your heroes! Got it?! Don't try to bug me! "- Karan, is Deepak there? - oh, sister-in-law. Im Deepak.' "While writing your name on her wrist, Shivangi slit her nerve.' Im calling from Holy spirit hospital Please rush here soon. And don't tell Karan anything. "Sister-in-law, don't worry, Ill be there right away.' Hey jerk! Not now sister. "Sister-in-law, how is Shivangi? Is she out of danger?' Yes. But even the doctors were scared initially. She just wouldn't stop bleeding. I thought I had lost her. "Sister-in-law, don't cry. Everything will be all right" Shivangi was my husband's favorite. She is like a daughter to me. - I wonder why she was so crazy? - I very well understand this. I have a cure for it too. Please wait here. What madness is this? You had told me that someone else is a greater fan of yours than me. Who had etched your name on her wrist "I also tried, but I don't know when I fell unconscious.' I had lied to you folks. - But I took it seriously. - But.. But why? So that my name is on top of the list of your fans. can anyone love someone so dearly? Yes. Will you come close? Closer. I love you. Whatever you are doing is not good. And what is it that Im doing? Don't try to hide from me. I know everything. You and Deepak... - It's better if you don't meet him. - Why? Isn't he a nice human being? "of course, he is a very nice person.' - But.. - But what? "Look, Chutki. It's not advisable to talk to Karan now.' "As, all he can think about is your brother's killer.' "If I talk to him now, he will get angry.' So I suggest you remain quiet for a few days and not meet each other. When the time is right Ill personally talk to him. "And Im sure, Karan will never say no to me.' " Don't cry, Chutki.' What happened? - Ill never meet you again. Not meet me? Why not? Because neither brother nor sister-in-law will be happy. Hence it's better.... if we don't meet again. Why not? Why won't Karan accept our relationship? We love each other. Ill straight away go and tell him... ...that I want to marry you. "No, Deepak. Karan will never understand our feelings.' He cannot see beyond the law and his duties. He won't understand our sentiments. Why won't he? Hitherto no one has made an effort Love can even melt a stone-hearted person. What? Love?! And that too brother Karan? "He can't even smile, what will he think about love.' He will Shivangi. We will teach him how to love. "When he realizes what love is, he'll value our love too.' And after that our path will be cleared. No way. He's always talking about guns and bullets. Which girl is crazy to fall in love with him? "There is a girl Shivangi. And he will fall in love.' Ill bring such a twist in his life that he'll be left with no choice. Not everybody get what they want Why not? Tell me something. How do you find Karan? Absolutely boring. of course. All the time he moves around with a sick look on his face. There's no smile on his lips. A curt look. And neither have I seen any sympathy in his eyes. You know how he looks when he walks? Like a loaded revolver dressed like a man. Don't say that He has lot of sympathy for you if not for others. oh forget it That's a load of bull-shit! He can never have sympathy for anybody. That's where you are wrong. You have only seen his face. Come down a bit and peep into his heart He's like a coconut A hard exterior and tender within. I don't believe you. Why don't you believe me?! I...I swear to...my make up. I stay with him 24 hours. And most of the time he only talks about you. About me? Really? "Ijust swore, and still you don't believe me?' - What does he say? - He says that.. He says that.. He doesn't say anything. He's foolish in this matter. - But one thing really hurts him. - What? That you dance on the streets and bandy words with men. And...and pick pockets. What do I do? I have to do something for a living. "No, Basanti. Don't sacrifice your love for your living.' Just imagine that you are a police officer's wife. You'll get so much of respect "Just imagine, your orphan children will at least have a father.' - You have come?! - Hey! At least leave my uniform! "- You want to be a police officer? - Yes, I do!" - You dare scold my children?! - I was only... You didn't answer my question. "speak up, Basanti. speak up!" What do I say? This dream can't come true. - It can Basanti. It can! - How come? - Will you do as I say? - I will Why did you get me here? "- Buddy, Im very unhappy today. - What do I do?' "Look, buddy. I have no one in this world.' Only Dhansukh... my secretary. "- And you, my friend. - Listen to me carefully.' Im no friend of yours. After your work is over we go separate ways. And why have you got me here? Whether you take me as your friend or not.. I want to spend the evening with you. - Why? Because today is my birthday. - Now what? - Today is my birthday. - How about a drink? - No. I lose control over myself. "You must've drunk hooch. Ill treat you to ""Deepak Kumar special"".' "- No, I won't - Today is my birthday!" - Only one. - okay. - Let's go. - One is for enmity. "- I don't care. I won't drink! - Scared, eh?' Me? - That's it - Is that all? I forget to tell you. Basanti had called this morning. She sounded scared. "She says every night at 10, someone knocks at her door.' - Why? - I don't know. You left her among the wolves. "Imagine, if someone breaks open the door, then her chastity will..' Why will anyone do that? Ive taken responsibility to protect her honour! Understood! You are here and she is there. I must go. He has not yet come. He is here! You? You are drunk? No. I...am drunk. "You here, at this hour of the night?' One should solve night problems in the night only. At 10 o'clock some son-of-a-gun... "...knocks at your door, and disturbs your peace.' He's here? Don't open the door. Im getting very scared. But what are you doing? Please stay away. "The next time he knocks, Ill pounce at him immediately.' And Ill beat him so much... Stay back. My clothes with hers? " Basanti, what happened?' You have ruined me! Im undone! Last night you did whatever you liked. - What..what did I do? - What did you do?! You... "- Basanti, don't cry. Listen to me. - Don't come near me!" One minute. Ill just come. Come again? You did everything? You raped that girl? People revere and respect cops. And that very inspector has outraged... a girl's modesty? I could never imagine that you are a devil in disguise. Poor Basanti. I didn't do it deliberately. It was an accident What do I do? What do I tell you? You have only two options. Either serve a term for seven years for rape... ...or get married to her. How's that possible? Neither does she know me nor do I love her. As far as knowing you is concerned by now she knows you too well And as for love... you know this country of ours is amazing. Girls here fall in love with their husbands after marriage. "Just get married, she will start loving you.' - Shall I send for invitation cards? - Hey! Wait! - But... - No ifs and buts. "Tell me something, if she tells you that she loves you...' ...then will you marry her? "- Yes...if... - Yes, speak up!" If she says ' I love you ' then it's fine. Deepak here. Do as I have told you. Im giving Karan the phone. Whatever happened last night.. I am.... ...extremely sorry. "- Basanti, here. - Yes?' Goli's goods worth millions have been delivered to a godown at Vashi. "If you wish, you can raid that place right now.' "- Now? - Yes, hurry up...' because at 4 p.m the goods will be shifted.... ...and delivered to their respective dealers. 4 p.m! "According to Basanti, there must be only four to five men here.' Im going down and you... will stay here. "- You won't come after me, okay! - Why?' Why not? I will come! Fine. Come after me. " Karan, if you don't release me!" Come on! The keys! Quick! Why? "If it wasn't for your timely help, Id have...' "By saving my life, you have proved that you are a hero and not a zero.' Today I saved your life. Will you give me anything I ask for? What? "Karan, I...I love your sister and want to marry her.' Such a big loss? Such a big loss?! Only half an hour more. Only half an hour more! And the goods would have been delivered to the dealers. There's someone. There's someone amongst us... ...who is a police informer. - Yes? - Should I say something? Im getting scared. You go in and Ill wait out? - Why? - Ive a wife and four children. Im the only bread winner. And this terrorist has committed 30 murders. - Thirty murders? - If I die they will become orphans. Im getting very scared. What's this? "Why are you fooling at this time? Forget it, sir.' What's this for? "When the terrorist comes, you'll lose your heel Keep it in!" "Sir, you go in. May God protect you.' This is loaded. Keep it Only to protect you. "If required, shoot only at the leg. If required.' And don't come out of the jeep. Don't step out of the jeep. "Stop, or Ill shoot Stop!" " Stop, or Ill shoot!" He has a machine gun! He is running away! Shoot! Stop! Stop! What have you done? You shot Ramlal?! No! I thought it was someone else. Do you know the consequences of shooting a police officer? No. Didn't I tell you not to step out of the jeep. Didn't I tell you to shoot at the leg? Why did you shoot on the chest? What have you done? Ive killed a constable. "My life, my career everything has got ruined.' Listen. - Give me this revolver. - You are arresting me? "If someone learns you've committed this murder, you'll be hanged.' Ill only lose my job. "And if I take the blame on myself, you'll be saved.' And so will your career. At the most.. ... Ill lose my job and will be sentenced for a year or two. You must leave this city and go away. Forget that such a thing ever happened or you saw it happen. Ill handle everything. Nothing will happen to you. Nothing. Give all kind of monetary support to Ramlal and his family. Ive explained everything to my secretary. "Appoint a nice lawyer, if you want Don't worry about the money.' One minute. Take this. Ill be here for a few days. Do keep me informed. "And Karan, Ill phone you after every half an hour.' Don't make that mistake. Because the lines will be tapped. "If someone hears our conversation, we'll be sentenced for a year or two.' " okay, I won't phone.' "Wait, Deepak. What are you doing?' "Karan, on one hand, is staking his life and his career.' And you are running away like a coward? Is your conscience dead? "You love Shivangi a lot, don't you? Then how will you face her?' "Get up, Deepak. And confess to your crime!" He was shaking with fear. He placed his head on my stomach. I was getting tickled ... I was about to jump. "Thank God, I didn't Or the truth would have been unveiled.' " But one thing is for sure, sir.' "The way you drove him out of the city, he'll remember all his life...' that even police officers are good actors. "- Who is it? - It's you. okay, tell me something.' I loaded fake bullets in the revolver. But how did you start bleeding? - Was that blood? - Then what was it? Tomato ketchup. "I filled it in a plastic bag and kept it here, and pressed it like this.' "And seeing the ketchup, he lost his senses.' "- Sir, only one clap. - Put your vest in.' To hell with the vest I feel like jumping with joy. How he ran for his life! "Let alone coming here, his plane won't even...' "- What is it? - The plane has landed, sir.' Landed? Where? This vest has become too long. Ill go and change it So last night... ...we were out to nab a dangerous terrorist? And I shot your constable by mistake? You did a great favour to me. You took the revolver from me and put your finger prints on it? "Look, next time you raise your hand...' "Let alone beating you, I can get you arrested for fraud!" You claim to be an inspector?! A police officer! But you are a cheat! And you and your cheap constable were making fun of me?! "I was crazy about you, because you were a complete man!" "By aping your style, your walk, I wanted to win an award!" But..but now I won't Because I don't like aping fakes. Just once you should have caught me by my collar slapped me... "...and asked me, how dare I fell in love with your sister?' I would have beseeched you. Fallen at your feet and asked your sister's hand in marriage. But no. Tears can melt hearts but not stone-hearted people like you. "You are a heartless, ruthless shrewd person!" You neither care about your sister nor her love nor her happiness! And not even her future! "Mr. inspector, first learn to protect hearts. You may then protect the law!" If moving around with guns and acting tough is duty for you... Then you are wrong! It's your pride and ego! We call it the act of a bully. "You wanted me to go away from your life, didn't you?' And your sister's life too? All right Im going away! Forever! "Be happy, and if possible let others also be happy.' "If I have made any mistake unknowingly, then do forgive me.' Take care. Are you happy now? "Are you happy, having broken your kid sister's heart?' You claim to be her elder brother! "But have you ever asked her what she wants, have you ever sat with her?' You didn't fulfill your duty but I will fulfill mine! "Im not only her sister-in-law, but her mother too.' And Deepak is the right choice as a son-in-law! "If someone else comes to marry her,...' I won't be alive to welcome him. "Had he been alive, then his decision would have also been the same, Karan.' " Dhansukh, where's Deepak?' He went upstairs. He was in a bad mood. Anything wrong? "Actually, Ive come to seek an alliance for my sister.' - That's good news. - I don't accept this alliance! You loved Shivangi a lot So what happened all of a sudden? She can't stay without you. Don't you love her? "I do! And I will till my last breath!" "But what you did with me, I can't forget all my life!" - I know I made a small mistake. - small mistake?! "Had I not returned from the airport, you had almost got rid of me!" But my conscience told me... that Karan is giving such a big sacrifice. "He's staking his life. Go back, Deepak!" And when I returned I saw this! What did you think I was?! "Deepak, you can't do this! You can't play with Shivangi's life!" - You have got to marry her! - I won't! What will you do? I... What can I do? Nothing. Nothing. - On one condition. - What? First smile and say please. " smile, Karan.' "- Get up, Ramlal - No, sir.' It's time to leave the world. "- Don't joke, Ramlal! - No, sir.' "Im not joking, sir. Ive been really shot" Today I learnt how painful it is when you get really shot "- Nothing will happen to you. Get up! - No, sir.' " Sir, will you do me a favour?' - What? - Won't you tell me? " Ramlal go and tuck your vest in!" " Say it, sir.' No. What's this? Such a short meeting? We had just met And he left? Friends! From today they are my foreign partners. They do the same business in their country which we do here. They don't stay anywhere for more than an hour or two. Because they are wanted by the police all over the world! Soon they will leave. So I wanted you to meet them. Because many of you will have to go to their country for business. "Come, Mr. Peter. Ill introduce you to my partners.' This is Mr. Ram Mohan. This is Mr. Peter. Basanti here. I have found proof against Goli. "Mona just left from here, she had camera in her hand" What? "someone has made a call to the police station from here, sir.' - From which room? - 402. From Mona's room. - What nonsense?! - She is on line! Put me through. This roll contains all the black deeds of these smugglers. And not only that With the help of these picture you can easily arrest Goli and his men. This is the best opportunity. "Through this roll you can get to your brother's killer.' "- And send them to the gallows. - Hi, love.' Ill call you later. Whom were you talking to? A...a friend of mine. Where is the roll? Which roll? Then why is there sweat on your brow so beautiful? What are you saying? Don't you believe your Mona? I was wondering... "...how our goods were being seized, despite all the secrecy.' And who has been giving information to inspector Karan? So it's you! You! I loved Mona very much. When I could kill her with my very hands.... ...you...you are just her look alike. Imagine what Ill do to you. " Tell me, where's the roll?' Look here and tell me where is the roll?! - Where it should have reached! - Where?! To inspector Joglekar! - There's bad news for you. - What nonsense are you talking? Your Basanti is in my custody. Ill tell you later who I am. - First give me the roll - Roll?! Which roll? Or Ill cut your Basanti into pieces... ...and throw her in the courtyard of your police station. But the roll.. " So inspector, are you dumbfounded?' "- I want an answer. - okay, Ill give you the roll" But nothing should happen to Basanti. " Tell me, where must I bring it?' Listen carefully. Is Basanti okay? Basanti's life is in danger. "They want the roll which they didn't find it with Basanti.' They think I have it But where do I get it from? - The usual trick! - Meaning? Buy any roll from the market Till they develop it.. -...we'll get her released. - How can... We shouldn't underestimate ' our enemles. "We'll take the roll but my way.' I might escape from the police here. But the police abroad will find me at any cost They won't spare me. You think Karan is a fool?! If I don't leave with Basanti in ten minutes... ...he will be here with the entire police force. Where is the roll? Get it here. First show me Basanti. "Look, Ive got another gift for you.' Which will make you come to me running like a small child. Look. Hey actor. Where are you going? You think Im a fool? "First the roll will be developed, then printed...' ...the photographs will be seen and then they will be released. " Deepak, move!" Stop those scoundrels! Quick! Blast the tire! Come out! Move! " It's very painful isn't it?' Actually you have also caused me terrible pain in my life. Therefore... ...there's a strange intoxication in causing you pain. I like it Im enjoying. " Look, tell me where the roll is!" Or you will undergo this torture for a week. I might get tired. But he is a devil Let alone a week. Continue this even for a year! yet I won't give you the roll I won't! Why do you want to torture yourself to death? Die like your brother died. An easy death. You know how your brother died? "At my behest, he pumped five bullets into him.' He was torn to shreds. You see this loyal servant of mine? He is very heartless. "Bloody hell don't hit me on my face!" You know the value of my face is more than your master's factory. "Never mind. When he comes around, start the torture again.' He won't acquiesce so soon. "Be it in film or reality, hero always rescues the damsel in distress.' Hurry up. Wait Come on out! Or your artist friend won't be alive to perform before the world! Come out! Or Ill kill everybody! Come out! Ask me what fear is?! When I leave home in the morning. Im not sure whether Ill return home in the evening or no! I can't say at which crossroad death waits to maim me! "He's saying exactly what I told him! Yes, exactly the same!" "- Sir, he has copied... - Be quiet" He is looking so nice in this uniform. - Where are you going? - I don't want to see this film. " Nice film, isn't it?' Is something burning?
