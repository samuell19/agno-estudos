Jesus, I don't know. I'm trying to, you know, sum my life up. And I can't.. It's difficult to do that. I was frightened it was going to be walking over old territory and what you really wanted was something, remember those confession programmes on television. John Freeman used to be the man who interviewed people. And with the camera just relentlessly on them, often in closeup. You waited for the tears to fall as the questions about their mother were answered in sobs. He tried to break people down. And you saw the real person behind the image. Well, I don't really have an image, do I? I'm an actor. Those are my images. And beyond that, I try to be myself. I am interviewed an awful lot. And I've learnt long ago to edit myself as I go along. You're announced. Your public persona is briefly described and on you walk. Now, do I walk on modestly, do I walk on confidently, do I betray that I'm scared stiff because I don't know what the questions are going to be? Very difficult just to be yourself. So I treat it as a bit of acting. Oh, here comes Ian McKellen. Now, what side of Ian McKellen am I going to present? The idea that an actor is discovered and their lives change, it might, but you're not really aware of it. Then or afterwards. Your life is a series of events, interconnected. I suppose the most crucial decision I made was deciding to try and become a professional actor. Looking back at the point in which I made that decision, which was toward the end of my first year at university, it does look as if from an early age I had been preparing for that moment, but I hadn't. But it looks like that. It makes sense. My love of theatre and my sister's love of theatre came from my mother and father. And my mother did a little bit of amateur acting. The first time I ever appeared on any stage. If you're a boy and your sister's five years older than you, that is a gap that's never quite bridged, and never was. Jean's dead now. No, Jean was a member of a secret society. She organised with some girlfriends. And I think the second rule of which was Ian McKellen may not belong to the society. Still rankles a bit, that. I was brought up in the northwest of England in the little mining town of Wigan. (chattering) I liked nothing better than going into town and just spending an hour and a half looking at things. And there was a weekly market. Stalls were set up by people just for the Saturday. And I would go with my sweet ration and just wander around the stalls and watch. Each of them were selling their wares. They put on a little show, you see. Every sort of 20 minutes, they did their pitch. A man selling hair restorer wore a wig, I noticed. (chuckling) There was a man who sold a polish for your tables. A little crowd would gather around these people as they said their pitch. And sometimes I was called into help. You don't know me, son, do you? Never met me before, no answer. Yes, well here, even a kid can do this. And I'd put on the black polish for him. Performers, you see. Right up close to performers I was. The fair, that was very important. Fun fair arrived twice a year. Took over the main square in town. Set up all their rides. They ran the rides, there were stalls that sold black peas, and it was Her Majesty's Smallest Subject. Wonderful marquee. A light landing on Anita. Who was inside the booth. And you paid threepence and you went on in and there was the smallest woman I've ever seen. She was about that high. Smoking a cigarette. In a cigarette holder so it wouldn't burn her skin. She had a little high voice. Move on, move on, go on, you've had enough. (chuckling) And the first smell I was attracted to were the greasy-haired tight-trousered young men who were running the caterpillar and the big wheel and all that. Fair, very important. And I went around there on my own. This was only five minutes from where we lived. So adventurous. When I was about eight, there was a big event in Wigan. The town stopped because the king and queen were visiting us. Exciting. And I thought, "How do they do this?" "They've got a light on in that car." "They're wearing makeup." "They've made this look very impressive." "This is our town, this is where I go to school." "I cross this street every day." "And now, no traffic except that car." Someone's organised that, I thought. So, at a very early age I was thinking how to put on a show. I don't know where it came from or what made me do it on the particular day that I did. I went up and I painted a little moustache here and mussed up my hair and found a hat and came down waddling like Charlie Chaplin. And everyone laughed. I dressed up as Sir Thomas Beecham, who was a famous classical music conductor. A bit of cotton wool for his beard and moustache. Once, when I was about eight or nine, I went out into the street with my clothes on back to front. Easy enough for the jacket and the trousers and the shirt and tie that tied at the back. Tricky with the shoes. You can't get the shoes in the wrong direction. And I would go out in the street. Tried to fool people that I was... You see, I walked backwards to appear to be walking forward. It's very, very intensely human activity, acting. I had a different accent at school than the one I used at home to fit in. And I was acting. All the world's a stage and all the men and women are merely players. They have their exits and their entrances. And one man, in his time, plays many parts. Human beings, as opposed to animals, act all day long. Select when they get up in the morning what costume they will wear, what impact they want, what side of their personality will be expressed. You're never just yourself. You're a part of yourself. My contemporaries would define themselves by their relationships with girls. I had this compensation that Ian was the lad who loved the theatre. That's what it felt like, I think, that when I woke up in the morning (gasping) we're going to the theatre tonight. Oh, I'm going to rehearse a play today. That was sort of how I defined myself and what gave me real satisfaction. For my mother's birthday in 1948, the family went and sat in the dress circle to see a new musical written by Iva Lovello. He wrote very, very successful musicals in which he starred, although he didn't sing himself. He played the piano. And when he lent over the side of a sofa and gave a glass of champagne to the leading lady who was reclining on the couch, aged nine or so, I had an erection. I could quote David Hockney who said when he was about the same age, he went to the cinema, and the man next to him put his hand on his cock and David says, "I've loved the cinema ever since." The same could be said to me about the theatre. I suppose I felt I was different, and that concerned me. And when it came to sexuality, there was silence. I was blind, there was nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothing to feel. Making me feel, in a sense, I didn't exist. [Interviewer] Were you conscious of the fact that it was illegal... No. I just didn't think about it. It wasn't a problem, it was just a fact. And I (sighing)... It's strange, looking back, when I meet 13 year old boys and girls who are pretty certain about their sexuality, can even define it, put a label on it, talk about it. It's another world. I suppose I was repressed. I suppose the fact that it wasn't talked about and that I didn't talk about it meant that I was not really developing in a very healthy way. Probably one of the reasons why I enjoyed acting, I could deal with emotions and self-expression in a very public way. Which I couldn't do in real life. And if it was a substitute for an interest in sex, then no wonder it's stayed with me as long as it has. I had a secret. Didn't talk about it, didn't understand it. But it was mine. When we got to Bolton and I was 12, there were three theatres. At the Grand, there was a changing bill of variety acts. Singers, dancers, comics, magicians, singing troupes. Quite famous, some of them, had been on the radio. On a Tuesday, when I knocked on the stage door, Mr. Bleakely said I can go down. Oh yeah, go down in. I'd go down onto the stage level. And in the dark and the dust, there were these ropes going up to the flies that pulled the scenery. I went into the dressing rooms, I met these performers. Having a wretched life, I suppose. Paid very little money. Touring around a different town each week. Every week of their lives. But when they stepped out into the light of the stage from the darkness, they were transformed. They smiled, they preened, they presented themselves. I'd go and stand by the stage manager. And I could hear the audience laughing and clapping, gasping. I'm always looking for that dividing line in the theatre. When are you onstage, when are you backstage? And these wonderful troupers knew that world so well and I just was fascinated by it. It was going backstage there and meeting professional performers at close quarters, I think, which decided my fate and that it was inevitable, although I didn't feel it at the time, that I would become one of them. While other boys were playing football or while other boys were playing in the playground, while others were going to the scout troop, I was putting on plays, every turn. It defined me. I was constantly trying to improve, trying to work out ways of which I could get better. I would, on a Monday morning, knowing the lines, knowing the plot, look in the mirror and think, what does this character look like? And it was the mirror that helped me. I'd try on those moustaches, pull those faces and, oh I see, oh that'll do. I was brought up by a very loving group of people. But North Wales is where we most went for our holidays to be with them, bicycling together, black berrying. Yeah, that's a big part of what I enjoyed about being a kid. When I was away in a school camp and my uncle John came down to tell me. And I then defined myself as Ian was the boy whose mother had died. My mother died of breast cancer. Love, comfort, hugs, kisses. I never talked to a psychiatrist about this but my dreams after she died were that my father had put her away, hidden her, taken her away. And sometimes in the dream, she would come back. And there would be a wonderful reconciliation of a woman who was not quite herself... but still loved me. I felt at the time I didn't feel it. But I must have done, and I still do. It was her having said to her sister reported to me after her death that if Ian decides to become an actor, she'd be happy because actors bring such pleasure to people. And I didn't need anybody else's approval. When I left home to go to university, I think I rather knew I wouldn't go back, because I had become, I might join in with this other part of the world which I could relate to. There is a world elsewhere, Coriolanus says, and I knew what world it was that I was intrigued by. To get into Cambridge, which is a series of colleges which have their own entrance exams, I failed at all those. But there was one last chance. And I went for an interview. (knocking) He was smoking Bachelor cigarettes and he offered me a glass of South African Sherry. And he said, "I hear you are an actor." Yes, sir. [Ian Voiceover] I don't like actors. Read any Shakespeare? Yes, sir. I played King Henry V, sir. [Ian Voiceover] Do me a speech. Now, sir? [Ian Voiceover] So I put my glass down and I stood on the chair and I said... Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more. Or close the wall up with our English dead. In peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness... And he gave me an exhibition lesson and a minor scholarship. (chuckling) So, the most important audition I ever did in my life, and that's how I got into Cambridge. The assumption was that you would work hard at Cambridge academically, and I was warned not to go down the previous path that Peter Hall had followed. I did 21 productions in three years with amateur undergraduate groups in Cambridge. And most of the people there spoke with a posher accent than I did and that's when I get rid of my Lanarkshire accent, I mean quite deliberately. Other undergraduates are doing the same sort of thing. I mean, who would guess that Derek Jacobi comes from deepest, Leytonstone. No, he had a bit of a posh accent too. Although my first year I was living in digs. I couldn't work there because of the television on below my little bedroom which was also my study. Because you had to be in your college by 10 o'clock at night, and if you didn't have permission to stay out later to rehearse the play with, you had to climb over the gates. I was away from home when I didn't have to have an ongoing relationship with my father and my stepmother, who would occasionally come and see the shows. So talking about my relationship with men was easy enough to avoid. The idea of being a homosexual wasn't alien within theatre circles at university. So, when I fell in love and was attracted to one person more than any other, it just seemed right. Some of the undergraduates were doing a production of Caesar and Cleopatra, amongst whom was Curt, Curt Dawson. It was innocent love on my part, I think, and on his. The big advantage to me of Cambridge was that I'm joined in that ethos, that group, that mafia of young people who were determined and confident and wanted to have a life in the theatre. The national newspapers would come down and review us. Anyone studying drama, to be reviewed by the Sunday Times or the Observer or the Guardian or the Telegraph, what a gift that was. Your name became current. When I was starting out, the parts I generally played were not people my own age, but people in disguise. Old people. Extreme characters. I was playing Justice Shallow in Henry IV Part Two, an old man. And the headline was Here's a brilliant Justice, but who is he? And then the piece then went on to say, I'd like to know this actor's name because it will obviously become a name to remember. And when I read that, I decided to become a professional actor, that was it. Your duty is to arrive in the theatre as absolutely physically fit and relaxed and alert as possible, having rested during the day so that when you come onto the stage full of energy. At the peak of your abilities, physical and mental. The people who have been at work all day say, "How do they do it?" Well they do it because they haven't been doing anything, but now they are. And you give your energy to the people who have been working all day, who need some energy to revive their spirits for the next day. That's what acting is about. That's how you contribute to society. The impact of your performance is not predominately facial, particularly if you're too far back in the theatre. What becomes important is the silhouette, the whole body. The way the character walks, gesticulates, his voice, the whole body is the way, probably, I'm going to get into feeling and believing that I am the character. I walk differently in every character I play because human beings do walk differently, I've noticed. You could not act in the professional theatre in London. You couldn't be on television. You couldn't be in a film unless you were a member of British Actor's Equity. Well, what could you do? You went out of London to work. That's what we all did. And we learned how to act professionally. We learnt the rigours of the routines and the techniques and the attitudes. The romanticism of my love for the theatre, it was indulged and satisfied. I had quickly moved into a flat. This new theatre had flats for the actors. We did modern plays that had come straight from the West End. We did reviews, we had to sing, I had to dance. Did adaptations of Dickens. We did Shakespeare. Did Chekhov. Being befriended by actors who had been working in the theatre for 20, 3O years and really knew what they were doing. Yes, I was in rep at Ipswich and just got myself an agent. And she received a call from the Nottingham playhouse which had just been built and asked me would I play, she thought, the first citizen in Coriolanus, which Turin Guthrie was going to direct. Now, the first citizen was quite a good part despite its anonymity, and unanonymity. And I went out there very thrilled to be doing that, and we sat around for the first day's rehearsal, which was going to be a read-through of the play, and Guthrie, just before that started, said, "Now, where is the Aufidius?" And everyone looked around, including myself, and until the finger was pointed at me, and I was told that I was playing Aufidius and my agent had just misheard over the phone, the first citizen, Aufidius. They have the same sort of rhythm. And I suddenly found myself playing what was turned out to be practically, well, the second leading part. At the end of Coriolanus, when his rival and dear friend slaughters him, Aufidius expresses his deep regret that he's killed his best friend. And that's normally played as ironic. And Guthrie said, "No, be truthful." "You killed him, you needed to kill him," "you had to kill him, you couldn't" "stop yourself killing him, and you do immediately" "see the other side of the situation." "So that's what you must feel." "You must turn on a sixpence." And he encouraged me to wail deep, deep subtle grief. Cry that wasn't written by Shakespeare. It was a moment I dodged in all the rehearsals. But I knew that I was going to have to do it at some point, and at the dress rehearsal, I tried to do it and couldn't. And Guthrie came down the aisle wrapped up in a scarf, he had a cold. And said, "lan, you have to do this." "You have to persuade the audience." "These are people who are living at the extremes." "You have to be heartfelt and you have" "to be utterly committed and let's do it again now." (dramatic music) And I did and found I could for the first time, perhaps ever, is to dare, risk, be carefree, to be unembarrassed, to be bold, not be shy, to know, or at least take advantage, of the fact that in that moment, you are in charge. However useless your life outside might feel as that's happening, you're doing Shakespeare's bidding as it were. And my dad came to see Coriolanus and he met Turin Guthrie. And Guthrie said, "You must be very proud of your son." Dad and Gladys, my stepmother, came to the first night party in our flat. Dad sat on the floor, I had never seen that before. Chatting up the actresses, I think. Well, they were all intrigued by him, he was an attractive man. Gladys thrilled to be with some professional actors. She's adored them since she was a child. And three weeks later, he had a stroke or something, a blackout driving the car before the time of safety belts. The steering wheel caved in his chest and he died a day later. During my teenage years, I was horrible to my father. I wouldn't talk to him. I just couldn't. I didn't know why. I saw only things that I thought he did wrong. I didn't see his merits. No, I wasn't much of a son. Well, that's because I was a gay and if I had a girlfriend I was proud of and wanted to show off and talk about getting engaged, of course I would have gone home. Well, I was in a play which there was a coffin on the stage. And I went to the funeral and I came back that evening and did the show. I don't think actors do it these days. I think if somebody close to you dies, then you take the day off. But we didn't then. The show must go on, you know? I must have tried to get into films. And yes, they didn't really want me. I went for an interview to play Noel Coward, just an interview. And somebody there said, "He's got the look of the young Noel." And I reported this to my agents at the time who was rather pushy who said, "Right." "Get yourself some photographs to take as Noel Coward." So back home, I asked a friend to come and photograph me. Impressed by these photographs, I was called in for a full day's screen audition. The man directing was the screenplay writer. He said, "You've got the part." "Dan Massit did it yesterday, but no, you nailed." Well, Dan Massit was Noel Coward's godson and I don't suppose my audition was ever taken seriously. And then there was an offer to be in a film with Gregory Peck, who was a big star at the time. And the snows arrived early that year and the whole thing was abandoned. So this young actor thought fuck it, really. If that's the way films are done, I don't want anything to do with them. So I threw myself into the theatre again. Maggie Smith, then at the National Theatre as a young actress, came to see her friend Phyllis Calbert, spied me and reported back to Laurence Olivier who was running the Old Vic as the National Theatre and said, "if you're looking for a Claudio" "in Much Ado About Nothing, I think he's done," "they're mending a bicycle onstage." I thought, this is big, big international stuff. This was the most famous theatre troupe in the world. I was employed to start off by playing the young hero in Much Ado About Nothing, which starred young Maggie Smith and her, I think, then husband Robert Stephens. Albert Finney was playing Don Pedro, the next lead. And I was sort of just below that. So I felt rather overwhelmed. Don't think I said more than 10 words to Maggie and they a few minutes when we were doing the play, I'd felt very much out of it, although my old friends from Cambridge days was in the company playing the villain, Derek Jacobi. I couldn't keep my eyes off Finney when we were rehearsing. And he was absolutely as charismatic offstage as he was on. But again, I couldn't feel I could befriend such an iconic young man. I didn't much enjoy doing it. I was very nervous all the time. And looking around me at all the other young men who were in the company at the National, I thought if I'm going to stay with this company, it's going to be a long time before I get to play parts in which I can really make my mark. So I left. And Olivier wrote a letter with typical florid language saying he was haunted by the spectre of lost opportunity. I got this offer to go and do a newly formed company called Prospect, it was Richard ll. And when that was a success, we revived it for the 1969 Edinburgh festival. And accompanied it with Christopher Marlowe's play Edward ll. It was a big production. It was 2O actors or more in the company. Simple sets, because they had to tour. There wasn't much money for anybody. My name's Ian McKellen. I'm a 3O year old actor earning 50 pounds a week playing Richard II in a play by Shakespeare and Edward ll in a play by Marlowe, at the end of a 12 week tour of theatres in Britain. (dramatic trumpet music) Alack, why am I sent for to a king before I have shook off the regal thoughts wherewith I reigned? I hardly yet have learned to insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend the knee. Give sorrow leave a while to tutor me to this submission. And yet I will remember the favours of these men. Were they not mine? Did they not sometime cry all hail to me? So Judas did to Christ, yet he and 12 found truth in all but one. I in 12,000, none. My swelling heart for very anger breaks. How oft have I been baited by these peers and dare not be revenged for their power is great. But shall the crowing of these cockerels affright a lion? Edward, unfold thy paws, and let their lives' blood slake thy fury's hunger. If I be cruel and grow tyrannous, now let them thank themselves and rue too late. [Ian] For me to be able to play two absolutely massive parts, established me as an actor in every sense. Sweet Spencer, we adopt thee here. And merely of our love, we do create thee Earl of Gloucester. [Ian] I was the leading, young leading man. I got the pick of the parts. You know. Although I wasn't really aware of it, I suppose I had become a young star. (upbeat music) - Ian McKellen. - Ian McKellen. - British actor Ian McKellen. - I think he's going to be a very important star. [Woman] One of his country's best actors. [Man] A man said to be the leading classical actor of his generation. [Reporter] McKellen could earn considerably more by staying permanently in London or going into films. But he prefers to go out on tour. I can't go through the stage door, which is where the actors and other theatre workers go of any theatre anywhere without being excited. Because there, I'm in this secret world that the public know nothing about. I relished, as a young man, being able to fill those theatres and reach people. The audience could forget where they were and just concentrate on the relationship that we were having. I felt that I could almost touch them, at least I could with my voice. My professional life is devoted to strangers. I'm in the company of strangers all day long. They're potential friends. I mean, I've had two or three stalkers for want of a better word. A young lady who I had met at a stage door no more than that, came into a rehearsal room when I was in London, picked up a glass ashtray, and broke it against the metal heater, and slashed her wrists, to what, get my attention or convey her misery with which she associated me. You can't really complain when you spend your life, professionally, trying to affect people's lives and their thoughts and their emotions. It's what you've been trying to do. You've been trying to get involved in their lives. To act for a long run in London doesn't hold that much appeal to me. It seems to me that the West End is mainly a tourist theatre. One doesn't really feel that one's contributing much to society in general from his acting to a lot of people who are just on holiday. When you come to Leeds, when you play to packed houses, you feel that for that week at least, you've set up your tent like a circus and you've made some sort of impact on people who won't forget you and their lives might just have been changed a little bit by the experience. The Actors Company was an idea that Edward and I had had together and we began by inviting some friends who, like us, perhaps had been with the big national companies. Felt a bit remote from how the organisation happened, and had been keen to organise themselves. If the play was going to be a success, it would be because the actors were working well together with the director. It's a subtle change. Normally, a director will choose the cast. In this case, the cast chose the director. I was touring. I wasn't London-centric. It was very, very hard work. But it revolutionised the abilities I had to present my case at a meeting. I've never had to do that before, really. Well, that changed my life absolutely. It was something I had initiated. It seemed easy because it was based on things I absolutely believed in the idea that it was only a group of like-minded people working closest together could put on the best productions. Well, you can imagine the sort of confidence that we all had that this was ours. It was us. My sense of inadequacy and discomfort and uncertainty. I felt strongly before I came out, I think. I related directly towards the first 49 years of my life, having on occasion to pretend to be something other than I was or not be honest about myself. I was absolutely not confident in being butch or over-masculine and that's probably to do with the fact that I was different and not interested in women, which these sort of characters were, I suppose. When I look back at TV stuff that I did early on, or film, I am not impressed at all. I'm a great believer in family, you know. Inheriting things and all that. Oh really? Oh yes indeed, it's amazing what gets passed on from father to son. And I don't just mean appearances either. Gracious. Liable to think not so bad on any terms. I can't bear it, and I won't. I've loved you every minute day and night since I first met you. Oh, doubt that the stars are on fire. Doubt that the sun's... Get off me. (Dog whimpering) I'm asking you to be my wife, Dora. If you love me even 1/10 as much as I love you, you can't refuse me. Dora, say you'll be mine. Say yes, Dora. [Ian] And it's when we did Macbeth in a very, very small theatre at Stratford, the other place with only a hundred people scattered around the stage, I realised that that was the size of theatre I most enjoyed. That discovery in 1976 began to fit me for television and the cinema. A handle toward my hand. Come, let me touch thee. Have thee not. And yet I see thee still. Art thou not a fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? [Ian] That way of doing Shakespeare is now the model for many people, that Shakespeare belongs in very small theatres where you're witnessing the dissection of a man's mind and imagination. Who lies in the second chamber? Donalbain. This is a sorry sight. [Ian] And in a small theatre, that's claustrophobically overwhelming, where every detail is available to everybody. Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold. Thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with. I was able to just be, exists, alert to the fact that it was a performance, but relaxed in the moment, making it fresh, and doing it just for these people now whose eyes I could actually look into as I was speaking if necessary. And that which should accompany old age. As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends. I was part of what's now looked back at as a golden era of the arts, see? A lifelong friendship with Judi Dench resulted from it. I loved working with her. She's not an easy actress to work with in one sense in that the audience are all in love with her. You feel rather cut out when you're onstage with her. Now, Judi can always be relied onto give you a good time, and she's, I think, would much rather be playing games, silly games. If she decides that we gotta do something, then we all do it. To enliven a matinee performance, she said she distributed little red sticking circles that you might put on a Post-it board. And we were each of us required to wear one of these red dots about our costume. And at the end of the performance, you would tell the group leader Judi how many red spots you'd spotted. (chuckling) John Woodvine playing Banquo knelt down to me as king and everyone else was able to observe that he got his other sole of his shoe. When we all saw it, we all laughed. Outrageous. Of course, the tricky bit is not to let the audience know you're laughing. Dear oh dear oh dear. We get away with so much, actors. I mean, the childishness of let's pretend, let's make-believe, bang, you're dead. We get to behave a way in which real adults don't do and we're allowed to do it. And thank goodness, because it's fun. I love laughing. Don't do it that often. Not many things make me laugh, but Sean Mathias makes me laugh, and our relationship, which began when we met as actors at the Edinburgh festival in 1978, I remember the first evening we spent together. What we were laughing about. (chuckling) (upbeat music) If you play the leading part in a hit show on Broadway, there are few more alluring prospects for an actor. Everybody knows who you are. Everybody thinks you're marvellous. It's a theatre town. If you make it there, you'll make it anywhere, you know. So it was terribly, terribly exciting. And the centre of New York was rather a wild place. There are no distractions of national politics in New York as there are in London. The main industry, really, supporting tourism is the theatre, is Broadway. And you're the top of the heap. Ian McKellen. (applause) My god, you're mixing with presidents. Almost every night, some local celebrity would drop by. Barbra Streisand arriving in the dressing room with Noel Coward. And I found myself introducing them to the other person in the dressing room. Do you know Rudolf Nureyev, who was the most famous dancer at the time. Rudy may have flirted with me a little bit. I don't think I really noticed. My name in lights for the first time. Whoa. It actually isn't that big a deal. But you say to yourself, oh I see, I've had my name in lights. Winning the Tony at the end of that year, it remains a confirmation that that was work well done. I think perhaps of all my awards that that's the one that means something to me, because it sums up what the year was like, number one. And when Sean and I fell in love, it seemed better for us to start our relationship of a formal nature by living in a place that neither of us had lived in before. So it became ours. Well, he's been a huge influence on my life. A director who's also a very close friend and who knows more about me than anybody else. And who loves me in a way that he won't let me do anything that is less than my best. My biggest weakness of an actor, don't tell anybody, is if there's a scene of high emotion, when a character's out of control of his emotions, you have to totally commit to that and in the moment delve into things that you perhaps don't know about yourself. And I found that difficult. What I can't get to grips with is the essence of the man. And so I'm having to go back rather in these late stages of rehearsal to absolute basics of what the man is. What do his attitudes spring from? An Englishman's home in his castle is quite a good summary. But it does mean, yeah, you don't interfere with other people. You have relationships with them, of course, you fall in love with them, you live with them, but beyond that network, you don't bother other people. Let them do what they want to do. Well, that is wonderful isn't it? But if it means that it inhibits you and that you don't express yourself and you don't risk and you don't stand up for yourself, then that's not good. [Max] I kind of pity him. [Prisoner] Germagnus Hershfield? Oh yes, yes, I remember him. - Berlin. - Berlin. He wanted to... Make queers legal. Yes, I remember. People who saw Bent, Martin Sherman's play about the ill treatment of gay people in the labour camps of the Third Reich in the 1930s couldn't help applauding every night. When I was interviewed about it I said, "Oh, this was a play about civil rights and humanity." I couldn't bring myself to say it was about the gay experience, which it self-evidently is. I'm not suddenly turning political, as it were. I'm not doing this play because it says something that I passionately believe in. I'm afraid behaving as a rather amoral actor who's seen a very good part in a very good play. [Interviewer] One of the methods of the play is the change that overtakes your character Max, isn't it? Who, initially, is more concerned with survival, later in the play does protest and declare his homosexuality. I mean, is that an important aspect of the character to you, in something about the play? You know, all great parts in good plays are charting of a journey. If Martin were to claim that it's mainly a play for homosexuals, about homosexuality, he would be denigrating his play. And that's not the case, I don't think. What woke me up was AIDS. [News Anchor] The sports council for Wales decided to fire the AIDS carriers from this pool and the National Sports Centre... [Woman Anchor] Firemen too were worried about the dangers. They fear they could contract AIDS in accidents from infected blood or from saliva when giving the kiss of life. [Reporter] 4,000 doomed to die from AIDS over the next three years. AIDS was the big, big issue of the 1980s. (sighing) It was a killer. It was a worldwide killer. And it killed some of my friends, including my first boyfriend Curt. And those of us lucky enough not to have the virus which led onto the disease which led on automatically to death, seeing friends dying around us, felt we had to do something. And one thing I could do was raise money for this centre that was being built called the London Lighthouse. And they needed funds badly because they were renovating an old school. And having just been doing my one man show act of Shakespeare in America, I thought if I put that on in London and don't charge for it, we could make a lot of money quite quickly, which is what was needed. The money from the box office would go the next day to the site where it would pay the workers who were opening up this building. And I would go into the audience with my bucket at the end and get further contributions. Carol Waters said could she have a word and as I was collecting money she said didn't I know anything about Section 28? And I didn't. But she gave me some literature and I came back home here and read it and immediately called her up and said, "What can I do to help?" Now, Section 28 was a mean-spirited little law brought in as a private members bill but adopted by the conservative government. Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay. All of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life. Yes, cheated. Which said that a local authority could not promote homosexuality. An odd phrase, 'cause you can't promote sexuality. But they meant it was a topic that should go on not being talked about, and certainly not in schools. Suddenly, I identified myself, before everything else, as a gay man, and cared about other gay men. Arguing the case against Section 28, I came out on a BBC discussion programme. [Interviewer] So, you would just like to see Clause 28 disappear altogether? Oh yes, I certainly would, yes. I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual. Apart from the whole business of what can and cannot be taught to children. The programme would not be broadcast for another two days and I had two days to tell people. They were all hugely supportive. Said they'd known for many years. And how glad they were that I felt able now to be honest about it. The image I've often used is of the removal of a weight on my shoulders that I didn't realise was there. And it fell off. Immediately. I felt physically healthier. And the shyness which I had felt all my life because I was hiding the fact that I was gay, found it difficult to talk about, I could now walk in a room and be proud. I found myself in the company of other people who wanted to make sure that that law or something like it could never happen again, because the law was passed and the law was changed and we did have Section 28. A new law which was clearly anti-gay. I've not been angry about many things in my life, but I got angry about that. And it was a fruitful act because it was a spur to use my methods of communication and my ability to communicate and my fame. Clause 28 is in part designed to keep us in our place. But it didn't work with me. Well do what you can, I think. If you want to join a group, go and join a group. If there's anything you can do on your own, do it on your own. Do whatever you can. And in doing that, come out, whether you're gay, lesbian, or straight, that doesn't matter. We all have to come out against Section 28. If you have to abseil into the House of Lords, do that. But it's the whole spectrum of our society which is affected by it, because gays and lesbians are everywhere and they must be seen to be everywhere. Being vocal, being sensible, being indignant. And if you can do it with a smile in your heart, we'll get there quicker, I think. And I went to other friends like Michael Cashwin, an actor who had come out about the same time as I did over Section 28. And he'd had the same idea that there should be an organisation to prevent anything happening like this again. There should be a permanent lobby. It should be a professional lobby. It should be paid for. Money could be raised to make it happen. And through that lobby, we would educate the public at a time when the press didn't talk about gays. Certainly not positively. So early on in setting up Stonewall, it was a group, and it was 10 lesbians and 10 gay men who eventually came together, gender parity. Founded on principle. And here I was, now in a committee hoping to make things happen. It felt like the Actors Company again. We were all on the same side. And then I gave up an awful lot of time helping to start Stonewall and imagining how it might be and raising funds, principle. My contribution wasn't much. I didn't understand the law. I didn't understand how to manipulate the press, which you have to do. [Reporter] Sir Ian McKellen's visit to Number 10 is believed to be the first time a prime minister has had an official meeting with an actor that is for homosexual rights. I directed and devised The Equality Show with Elton John and Sting performed together for us at the Albert Hall for free. Raising funds for Stonewall, awareness about the presence of gay people, suddenly the subject matter of being gay was in the public domain. In Britain, it is lawful for men and women to have sex at 60, but men can't have sex with other men until they're 21. This, say homosexual pressure groups, is an anomaly, and it's time to equalise the age of consent. I think the majority of people in Britain don't want this to become a more homosexual society. There has been a campaign for a long time to try to make homosexuality perfectly acceptable within society. We have it in the media. We have it with prominent people like yourself coming forward. I don't think it is succeeding. That is to say, I don't think that the majority of people. We don't want to go down the line of having more homosexuality because young people are particularly vulnerable. The majority of people are still very strongly opposed to spreading homosexuality, that they're not in favour of persecuting homosexuals. Well, you're repeating yourself. And again, it's the view of the majority against a minority and I don't approve it. But do please read the BMA report. And your idea that somehow people of 16 and 17 are vulnerable, was that your word? Undecided about their sexuality. No, sexuality is fixed. Everyone agrees, which is why the BMA has changed its mind, before puberty. Now that's not to say that young people are not confused about their sexuality, and no wonder when they hear, with respect, About it, and didn't walk about in the streets protesting that they were gay. You know, it took me 49 years to be honest about myself. And your arguments seem to be in favour of people being gay but not talking about it. Let's keep it to themselves and don't spread it. No one wants to spread it. It exists in society. Always has, always will. It takes two heterosexuals to make a homosexual. And so it carries on. Why not just be at ease with it? Admit there is a variety of sexuality. I'm not trying to stop you have children. I'm not trying to do anything to disrupt anyone. I just want some freedom for myself, and that's the argument I make on the behalf of the 16 year old that I used to be. And if I became known as that gay actor, I didn't mind at all. I was a communicator, I was an actor, I was a performer. And I felt I had found my place in British society. I didn't have sex until I was an undergraduate and I was just finishing Cambridge when I fell in love with a beautiful boy from Kansas who was about to become a professional actor. Curt and I and at last I felt I had joined the human race. But not entirely, because still we didn't talk about being gay. The idea of gay politics or any advance in gay rights just wasn't on the cards. And we were forced to live in this odd no man's land of loving where you could and no clubs, no bars, nothing. And one of the reasons I became a professional actor was that I'd heard that there were gay people in the professional theatre. (audience laughing) And it turned out to be the case. (laughing) The trouble about looking back on even your own life and who knows it better than one's self, and I get it wrong. My impression was that I always wanted to be a theatre actor and I was happy being a theatre actor. I had no ambitions to become a film actor. Well, my friends tell me that wasn't the case and I was always bellyaching about why has Tom Courtney got this part, why is Anthony Hopkins in films now? Why can't I be... I think I would judge the films I've made as before Richard Ill and after. After I had the confidence. When we were doing King Lear and Richard Ill in America over I think five or six cities across the States on the suggestion of Richard Eyre who had directed the play. When I asked him, "Couldn't we film it?" I started writing the film script. And I had to start being a film producer, something I had never done before. And will never do again. It took two years of persuading people that even on a limited budget of $6 million, we could ever make the money back. I used to get very, very nervous on a film set because of my insecurity of not having done much film-making. In preparation for a rather nerve-wracking business of starring in a movie, I visited, as I put it at the time, other people's films. I just got to see how it worked. What it was like to be in front of the camera. (sighing) We haven't got any business done tonight. [Stephen] Meet John Profumo, Minister for War. One day, I suddenly realised all these people behind the camera who had made me nervous, were all there not to observe and criticise and comment behind their hands, but to help. The director, looking. The cameraman, looking. Sound man, hearing. Makeup, checking. Costume people, looking. All with their own expertise, all contributing. And you're just the centre of their attention because everybody wants you to get it right. Everyone is supportive. They're not being critical. They're not observing, they're part of it. And that was a revelation. And now I find being on a studio one of the most comfortable places because everybody wants it to be good. Everyone's there together doing it. And I thought before they were the enemy really, rather than the friend. And the camera, well, you just forget about it. You can't forget about it but you know it's there but it's another friend. The rest was easy because I knew the part backwards. I knew what the production should be. I'd helped in the casting. We had a wonderfully strong cast of people who were very experienced in Shakespeare. And who were intrigued by the idea of putting it on film. Richard Ill comes out, I'm playing the leading part. I've got a credit as producer and as screenplay writer. And it got good reviews so oh hello, Ian McKellen, does Shakespeare on film. Oh, he's a film actor. Why I can smile and murder while I smile. And wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions. And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, I'm determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these deaths. Theatrical performance is appropriate because he's a theatrical showoff, Richard III. So a certain presentation was appropriate. Same with Magneto to a certain extent. Gandalf's a bit of a showoff as well. Those are the parts that I'm perhaps the best at playing. - Thank you. - The pleasure is mine. James Whale. James Whale, I found a very easy part to play. We had to shoot so much footage each day in order to get through in the time that the investment could buy. At the beginning of a long speech that I was delivering to Brendan at the end of a long day, I think with about half an hour to go. So that work has to stop, the director Bill Condon said to me, "lan, that's the situation." "And you've probably only got time" "to do the speech twice and it's a long speech." "You might want to do it more than that." "If you do, just keep speaking." "If you stop and come to the end of the speech" "and I say cut, that'll be the signal" "for the plugs to be pulled and for work to stop" "and you'll never get another chance." "That's the nature of film, it's your last chance." Well, that's how I got through the speech. I did it a number of times and I didn't stop. And you just sit there. You let me talk. Yes, the poor old man you think that I'm the crazy old poof. Why are you here? Let's get this straight. What do you want from me? I want to be a model, remember? Well of course I remember. What do you think I am, so fucking senile? Mr. Whale? How I could've been so stupid, stupid. Mr. Whale, you all right? What was I thinking about? The day I was nominated for an Oscar, I was playing in a repertoire of plays for the West Yorkshire Playhouse, which is in Leeds in the North of England and I had to do all my interviews on a telephone line in between performances. So I think life was going on as usual. I wasn't making any assumptions. The problem is, of course, once you're up for an Oscar or a Golden Globe even or a BAFTA or something, you are encouraged by the publicity department for whatever you're being nominated for to do all the interviews. To go around almost actively touting for the vote of the various members of these organisations. That's a bit unseemly. And all the actors know it. And they feel embarrassed even as they're holding their hand up and saying, "Look at me, look at me, look at me." (audience applause) And the success of that film, I think has given me as much pleasure as anything else in my life. It's fun playing man who once lived. You have more scope, don't you, if you're playing a character that is entirely fictionalised. I thought, at the time, I wasn't very good as Magneto, and I've had that confirmed for me seeing the films. If you look at the comics, Magneto is usually drawn from a low vantage point. His legs wide apart. A superhuman body of muscle and sinew and power. But then there's me, Ian McKellen, who (chuckling)... I did ask for a suit that was made for me which had false muscles in it and they used to put that on diligently each day to give myself wide thighs and calves and pecs. Becoming cartoon characters isn't easy. And we weren't helped by the costumes in which were costumes that fitted a film rather than fitted the outrageous nature of the story. (grunting) Mr. Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman, especially one who's interested in you. Those stories mean something, and I think that's what separates our, perhaps, X-Men from the other comic books. Superman, the Hulk, Spider-Man, I'd say even James Bond, are all the same people. Wimps who change their underclothes and become superheroes. Discover their inner life. That's not Magneto. Magneto is a political warrior, clear-sighted, pained, anguished, determined character. Really well worth playing. And in any civil rights movement, there is an argument between the Magneto character who says we bloody well fight to the bitter end and are proud of our difference and if necessary we'll be violent in our own defence, a sense that, perhaps, our difference makes us superior. Well, that may be the Malcolm X view of the black situation or Martin Luther King the Professor X, Patrick Stewart's character, who says let's learn how we can contribute to society, be a part of it. Fit in. Be proud of ourselves but care about people in society beyond ourselves. So, those are stories worth telling. It's not just adventure. It's not just fantasy. The war is still coming, Charles, and I intend to fight it, by any means necessary. And I will always be there, old friend. (dramatic music) Storytelling is so basic to human activity, as I suppose there isn't a nationality in the world in which young children aren't told stories. And stories bring human beings together. [Frodo] You're late. A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to. (laughing) It's one of the things I enjoy most about film is the reality of the set. In the theatre, it's all pretend, it's all make-believe, it's all hardboard and canvas. Nothing what it seems, which has its own delight. But you're on a set in Lord of the Rings, and there it is. One day, we were lifted up in a helicopter. I think I was the only actor, the rest were doubles. And certainly the pony wasn't a real pony, it was a boy and his girlfriend, that double. They had a hard time because we were dropped by the helicopter onto virgin snow on a high ridge. And you see this poor pony try to walk very, very slowly. Fall over into the snow. And we were abandoned by the helicopter, in which was a camera, and they filmed our progress up the ridge. I think only once because we had left our footprints in the snow and therefore couldn't do it twice. As we're going longer and I'm going snow up to my knees, with a perilous drop on one side and a bit of a peak at the other, I could be on Everest. It's about as far away from green screen as you can get. We were there. Constantly, we were there. And you ask any of the actors, there were other locations. I remember in The Hobbit other locations we were, again, lifted up by helicopter. I had to spend a day in the sunshine with a fantastic view over some lake or other and surrounded by mountains. Bliss. It was the lap of luxury in the wildest of settings. I was doing an early scene when all the dwarves, small, plus Bilbo, small, arrive in Bilbo's house, and big Gandalf is there too. So I had to look bigger than the rest of them. We rehearsed the scene. I met a group of actors who I didn't really know in full makeup. I then left their set and went into my own set which was made of green so that it could be removed, and a camera mirrored, it was then slaved, is the phrase, to the camera that was photographing the dwarves at the same time. So these cameras moved at the same time. Their lenses moved in and out. Mine was done by a robot. It was just me and a moving camera. Where should I look? 'Cause I'm meant to be talking to people who are on another part of the studio. Well, they'd obligingly put photographs of each of the actors on stands. And whoever was talking, the light flashed. The trouble was that these were photographs of the actors, not of the characters that I had just met. I didn't know who anybody was. That was green screen with a vengeance. And at the end of the day, my head fell so that my mouth was very close to the microphone which was hidden in my costume and I said to myself, "This is not why I became an actor." And I was quite tearful. This was broadcast across the entire studio. I honestly cannot remember what this has to do with the story at all, so... [Peter] You don't really need to. All right, so I'm just looking vaguely apprehensive. [Peter] Vaguely apprehensive and weary at the trees. This is potentially your first shot in Return of the King. And action. (eerie epic music) There are very few actors who have been in two what are called franchises, two series, popular, very popular movies. I was ready for it. I wasn't phased by it. I was in my 50s or even older. On gay issues, I had been a spokesperson. Now I could be a spokesperson for the films I was involved in. I was used to doing interviews. I was used to making the case. So that was a bit of luck not to become famous and successful in films when I was too young to quite know what I was doing. And very pleasing to me that it was an openly gay man who was playing Gandalf, an openly gay man who was playing Magneto. There it was, everybody knew. A few people said we can't have Gandalf the Gay, but apparently you could. Not that I played him gay. He's 7,000 years old, I think sex was a thing of the past for him. What I'm not good at is doing what I'm doing now which is trying to not edit myself. Not edit what I'm saying. Though of course we do. Just before we speak, we think what we're going to say. But really, I do. And sometimes I pause and think, hm, what would be the best way to put this. And it took, I think, doing a comic version of myself in a sketch written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, his writing partner, for their series Extras. They wrote a comic version of myself, a pompous actor, very pleased with himself and probably some sonorous tone came into my voice and I talked about the difficulties of my job and all that sort of thing. How do I act so well? What I do is I pretend to be the person I'm portraying in the film or play. Yeah. You're confused. - No. - Very simple, case and point. I was so alarmed at how stupid and comic I was with the slightly exaggerated version of myself that I realised that often when I had been on chat shows trying to be myself, what I had been is an exaggerated version of myself. The man who knows it all, the man who's wise, the man who's been there, done that. Well. Now I'm trying to just speak to you. Oh, here comes Ian McKellen. Now, what side of Ian McKellen am I going to present? Am I going to talk seriously about gays, in which the case I must drop anything that looks unnatural. Am I going to talk about the film or play I'm doing, which I'm hoping to persuade people to come see? I must convey my enthusiasm and I must also try and enthuse them, but who is them? Who am I talking to? It's a puzzle. But if you've got a message, it's a puzzle worth solving and coming to terms with. [Interviewer] And mark it. What are the things that you think about the most? Death. Every day- I think about how it might come about. I would think about how it would come about. It must be that feeling, oh I reckon, I'm really going to sleep now. Yeah, well, you can, forevermore. You can imagine that being quite attractive. Particularly if you're in pain or you've lost your reason or something. I renovated my house recently and I put in an elevator that was fortunate, room for a lift. And I don't use it as yet, but it's there. Otherwise, I think am I going to end up in a hospice or a hospital, or a geriatric ward, or an old people's home? Who's going to look after me there? I don't have family. I don't have any dependents who are going to look after me. So I have to sort of organise that myself. The other day, Sean Mathias, who is one of the executives in my world said, "Look, when you die", "we're going to have to organise a funeral," "but I don't know what to do." "So would you please sort it out?" That sort of turn. Well, I had an evening to spare and I did. I had the most enjoyable evening of (chuckling) my wish list of what should happen. Initially, my funeral, and then my memorial. I want no religion at either event. And I would like the memorial to take place in a celebratory way, in a theatre. Free admission. And I want a lot of beautiful people. I don't want anyone who didn't know me who was in it to be paid. And I thought I might like it to end with one singular sensation from a chorus line. When I finished this I thought, oh, I'd love to go to that funeral. (chuckling) So, I hope I might arrange a dress rehearsal before I go. You're not told that, when you're young, that when you're old, you think about death all the time. But I think it probably means as I've noted with people I've seen die, that they're ready. As I see other people getting decrepit and unable to work, I think, well, that may well happen to me. And when it does, there's not much I can do about it. But in the meantime, why deny myself the pleasure of rehearsing a play? What am I to say? _ gay I am happy. I am happy- - So am I. - So am I. We are happy We are happy. What do we do now that we're happy? Of all the methods of telling stories, the one which the storyteller is closest to the audience is in what we call live theatre. Well, I don't think I've ever been away from it, really. I've never imagined not doing a play again at the earliest opportunity. And when Godot ended, as we bowed to the audience, thank you, thank you for coming, hope you had a good time. Thank you, thank you. And I started to cry. (sobbing) [Friend] It's all right, it's all right. I feel that's my last performance on a stage ever. - That's silly. - No, god. No, darling, thank you so much. Thank you so, so much. The end of a play has been so intense, it's a family. A family has forged itself. A group who trust each other, who want to be in each other's company, who collectively are taking responsibility. And then it stops. Your life seems to be pretty meagre in comparison. Mine does. Now, I haven't brought up children. I haven't had one constant partner who I've been trying to nourish a relationship with a family life. Which, probably, is more satisfying than anything else you can possibly do. I don't have that, so I maybe invested what's needed to have kept that situation going into my work, perhaps. I am baffled how anybody can bring up children and act. Because acting takes everything out of me. I don't seem to have anything left. Sir Ian McKellen was in Gloucestershire today helping pupils put together a play about homophobic bullying. Students from across the county were there to learn some hints and tips from the master. What takes up quite a lot of time is visiting schools, at the moment. I tell them about my life and a child as a gay boy. A trend seems to be rather people in their early teens don't want to have labels because they don't find them relevant, that they want to be themselves. That's their label, me. And it's occurred to me that the label I put on myself as being gay is actually a label, although it has a new name now, it used to be queer, that other people have put on me, why should I be defined by my sexuality when anyone who's straight isn't? I now understand. So perhaps I shall stop being gay. Perhaps it's time I stopped talking being out of the closet. Remember, that's all in the past. So when you're with young people, you realise, even though you are old, you do have out of date attitudes. And how would I discover that if I didn't meet them? So, I go along and the part I'm playing is of concerned older gent who likes what I see because when I was their age, it didn't exist. Well, that's not true anymore. So I tell them what it used to be like and their jaws drop. And of course, I go along as the man who played Gandalf. And the first thing I say to them, and you know, I've polished this little routine that I have. If you don't do your revision properly, do you know what will happen? - What? - What will happen? You shall not pass. (cheering and applause) And you know, little Ian McKellen who thought he might want to be an actor, who enjoyed acting, never thought that actually the real centre of his life was nothing to do with acting at all. Well, that's what Roger Allam or Mike Gambon or Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Martin Alpers, would say about their lives, but they'd be referring to their children. I'm in the company of strangers all day long. My professional life is devoted to strangers. I think those of us who don't have children have a (sighing) need to feel that some part of our lives are just given to the next generations. It's very appealing if a young actor knows something about what I've done in the past and if it's had some impact on them in some way. Ed Norton tells me he decided to become an actor when he saw me do my one man Shakespeare show in Washington D.C. And Michael Brambidge, a big producer and director now, decided to become involved in theatre when he saw The Twelfth Night that I had set up and toured for the RC. That's lovely. It used to be that it was my secret, my life, my profession. I found it difficult to talk about, still do really. Although I'm coming on now. If I know about anything, and I don't, I can't cook. I can't run my finances. I'm not an expert on anything except this acting business. And I can't even talk about that because what I do is very personal and I'm in with a group of people who are all doing the same thing and they have been the most wonderful friends and lovers and protectors and guides and anything you could want from a human being, I've found in working in the theatre particularly. And now, I'm a senior member of this large troupe. (dramatic music) [Gandalf] You shall not pass! And isn't it funny, these visits to schools, my sister was a teacher. Her husband was a teacher. My uncle was a headteacher. Both grandparents were preachers. My father was a lay preacher. I'm one of them. It turns out. Trying to change the world, make it better. (upbeat dramatic music) And I wasn't in Harry Potter. (chuckling) Though sometimes they say they think I played Dumbledore. And sometimes I think I did. Oh, you know what it sounds like, is this an obituary? I'm still alive, I'm still here. What sort of music do you like? House? You what? No. I say indie pop- I don't know what it means. I think one thing I might say to young Ian is you know, you're quite attractive. I was. I didn't know. Nobody ever told me. (phone ringing) Hello. In fact, I thought on my 80th birthday one of the things I might get myself would be an orchestra. Just for the day. Playing only tunes I knew whilst I sang. Wouldn't that be fun? I've had most of my haircuts done for jobs, you know. Somebody I don't know and it probably not very good at the“ 'yob comes and cuts my ha“. Thank you. Free. And I wasn't nominated for Mr. Holmes. I was a bit disappointed. Because I thought it was sort of acting that they might have appreciated. And I said, "Who wins these SAG Awards?" And I looked it up on Google.
