A SILVER DOLLAR April 1865‭, ‬after the last North Carolina resistance with the surrender of Gen‭. ‬Johnston‭,‬ ends the bloody American Civil War‭.‬ Abraham Lincoln‭, ‬in his famous proclamation‭,‬ grants the brave southern troops the honor of arms‭.‬ ‭-‬The troops are ready‭.‬ ‭-‬Let them present arms‭.‬ Present arms‭!‬ Present yourselves in pairs‭.‬ Lt‭. ‬James Hamilton‭.‬ Lt‭. ‬William Morgan‭.‬ Capt‭. ‬Gary O'Hara‭.‬ Lt‭. ‬John Tery‭.‬ Lt‭. ‬Philip O'Hara‭.‬ Capt‭. ‬Charlie Stuart‭.‬ Lt‭. ‬John Hack‭.‬ Look‭, ‬Phil‭, ‬they sawed the cannon‭.‬ Mine too‭.‬ Look at ours too‭.‬ Captain‭!‬ This all have the cannon sawed‭.‬ Is this how you keep your word‭?‬ We promised you the honor of arms‭.‬ That gun can shoot‭.‬ You think so‭?‬ With the cannon like this the bullet deviates‭.‬ Maybe you're not a good shooter‭.‬ Let me see your gun‭.‬ Are you afraid‭?‬ Here you got‭.‬ Let's go‭, ‬boys‭!‬ First squadron‭!‬ ‭-‬What are you doing‭?‬ ‭-‬It's my turn now‭.‬ You already proved your skill even if it was a foolish stunt‭.‬ Quiet‭!‬ By granting you the honor of arms we wanted to award your courage as soldiers‭.‬ These guns are just a symbol of the honor we granted you‭.‬ Those who already have their guns can leave‭.‬ Lt‭. ‬Sam Maclnter‭.‬ The honor of arms‭...‬ Hundred ninety‭...‬ two hundred‭.‬ You took it all from us‭, ‬buddy‭.‬ You wouldn't have found a horse in 50‭ ‬miles‭.‬ So you decided to leave me‭?‬ Yes‭, ‬I'm sorry but I can't come back to Virginia defeated‭.‬ I made up my mind‭.‬ In the west‭, ‬either northern or southern‭,‬ only matters what you're worth‭.‬ Take this one‭, ‬it's better‭.‬ You have a long trip ahead of you‭.‬ Regards to Judy and our old house‭.‬ Will be given‭.‬ Take this‭, ‬the key to my coffer‭.‬ ‭-‬At the same place‭?‬ ‭-‬Inside the pendulum clock‭.‬ It's not much‭, ‬but you and Judy may need it‭.‬ Thanks‭, ‬Phil‭, ‬and good luck‭.‬ Same for you‭, ‬brother‭.‬ Don't forget in the west there's land and work for everyone‭.‬ For you and your wife too‭.‬ We'll see‭, ‬Phil‭.‬ Remember the last town on the road to the west is Yellowstone‭.‬ You'll have news of me beyond the border‭, ‬at Fort Best‭.‬ I'll remember that‭.‬ Goodby‭, ‬brother‭.‬ Goodbye‭, ‬Gary‭.‬ Who is it‭?‬ Who are you‭?‬ Judy‭...‬ Gary‭, ‬Gary‭!‬ Phil gave us this‭, ‬do you remember‭?‬ I've told you before‭.‬ Please‭, ‬Judy‭, ‬no‭.‬ You have to realize‭.‬ You saw it yourself‭.‬ There's no future here for us‭.‬ Yes I knew this moment was coming‭.‬ But not so soon‭.‬ In the war‭, ‬our doctor used to say‭:‬ ‭"‬If you have to cut‭, ‬better do it quickly‭"‬ That way there's less suffering‭.‬ There's no need if I go with you‭.‬ No‭, ‬Judy‭, ‬not yet‭.‬ ‭-‬Why‭?‬ ‭-‬Be reasonable‭.‬ I have to find my brother‭.‬ Find a job and a place to live‭.‬ Meanwhile‭, ‬you can sell the house the best you can‭.‬ It'll be just three months‭,‬ then we'll be together again‭.‬ Three months‭?‬ That's too long‭.‬ And then‭?‬ Where will I find you‭?‬ In Yellowstone‭,‬ the last stop of the stagecoach‭.‬ I'll be waiting for you‭.‬ You'll come with the spring‭.‬ Cheer up‭. ‬Smile‭.‬ ‭-‬Is this fine‭?‬ ‭-‬Perfect‭, ‬Mrs‭. ‬O'Hara‭.‬ It's not much but you could need it‭.‬ ‭-‬You'll need it more‭.‬ ‭-‬I wouldn't be fair‭.‬ Let's split it‭, ‬alright‭?‬ Alright‭.‬ This for you and this dollar for me‭.‬ ‭-‬But Gary‭...!‬ ‭-‬No‭ "‬buts‭".‬ You accepted splitting it and this is a split‭.‬ I assure you this is the first of a million‭.‬ O'Hara's word‭!‬ What can I do in this town to get a few dollars‭?‬ ‭-‬Jack‭, ‬it's late‭.‬ ‭-‬Yes‭, ‬very late‭.‬ Do you need help‭?‬ No‭.‬ I can work pretty well and I'll settle for not much‭.‬ I said no‭!‬ Excuse me‭.‬ What are you looking for‭?‬ A job‭, ‬just to buy a horse and leave‭.‬ In Yellowstone there's no work for outsiders‭.‬ You're southerner‭, ‬right‭?‬ So what‭? ‬War is over‭.‬ For us it did‭, ‬but southerners don't seem to think the same‭.‬ There's a band of outlaws around here‭.‬ They ravage‭, ‬loot and steal‭.‬ It's not your fault‭, ‬but I can't help you‭.‬ I just want to get across the border and go west‭.‬ How can it be that nobody can make me a few dollars‭?‬ Try McCory‭, ‬he's the richest man in town‭.‬ ‭-‬He could help you‭.‬ ‭-‬Where can I find him‭?‬ Over there‭, ‬where the sign is‭.‬ Thank you‭.‬ If everything is fine‭, ‬I'll come see you‭.‬ If not I think it's worth 50‭ ‬dollars‭.‬ ‭-‬Alright ‭-‬Thank you‭.‬ Damn Black Eye He dares to blackmail me‭, ‬McCory‭!‬ ‭-‬How much he wants‭?‬ ‭-‬Nothing‭.‬ He want us to leave town‭.‬ He dares to ask such a thing‭.‬ You could have called us‭.‬ James and I could take care of him‭.‬ You know I don't want trouble with the law‭.‬ We have to do something‭,‬ talk to the Sheriff‭.‬ Black Eye planned it well‭.‬ He knows the Sheriff it's out of town and won't be back until sunset‭.‬ That's why he cited me at 5‭.‬ I'll try to win some time‭.‬ But one thing is true‭,‬ I won't let anyone blackmail me‭.‬ What is it‭?‬ A man outside wants to talk to you‭.‬ Who‭?‬ By his clothes I'd say it's one of those southerners looking for a job‭.‬ I have no time for that now‭.‬ You take care of it‭.‬ It's impossible‭, ‬buddy‭.‬ You better leave‭.‬ I have to talk with Mr‭. ‬McCory‭.‬ ‭-‬He's busy‭.‬ ‭-‬I can wait‭.‬ I tols you to leave‭.‬ Let's go‭, ‬you dirty southerner‭.‬ Stop‭.‬ You know I don't want fighting in my office‭.‬ He refused to leave and attacked me‭.‬ I don't care‭, ‬James‭.‬ Take care of you business outside‭.‬ Now we'll see how brave you are‭, ‬southerner‭.‬ ‭-‬Mr‭. ‬McCory‭?‬ ‭-‬Yes‭, ‬that's me‭.‬ I came to see you‭, ‬but I have to take care of something now‭.‬ I'll be back later‭.‬ Stop that‭, ‬pal‭.‬ Put your guns away‭.‬ You're a pretty competent guy‭.‬ To risk your life like that without a weapon‭.‬ I can't do much with this one‭.‬ Oh‭, ‬unarmed‭.‬ A joke from the northerners‭, ‬right‭?‬ ‭-‬You are looking for a job‭?‬ ‭-‬Yes‭, ‬sir‭.‬ I may have something for you‭. ‬Come‭.‬ I see you're brave and also in big need of money‭.‬ You're right‭.‬ I can make you earn more than you think‭.‬ But you have to risk your neck‭.‬ Go on‭.‬ There's an outlaw in this town‭.‬ He's called Black Eye‭.‬ Very dangerous man‭.‬ He probably belongs to a band that infests this area‭.‬ He even tried blackmailing me‭.‬ So I decided to bring him to justice‭.‬ Why don't you talk to the Sheriff then‭?‬ I wouldn't be talking to you if the Sheriff was in town‭.‬ He went looking for a judge and won't be back till late at night‭.‬ But Black Eye will be already far away‭.‬ What should I do‭?‬ Face him and turn him over to the Sheriff‭.‬ And what do I get‭?‬ 500‭ ‬dollars‭.‬ And maybe a little land over the hill‭.‬ ‭-‬If everything works‭.‬ ‭-‬Pretty generous‭.‬ Facing Black Eye unarmed is risking your life‭.‬ It's better to pay than to break the law‭.‬ Alright‭, ‬I'll take it‭.‬ Here's half of it‭.‬ There's a hotel in town‭,‬ next to the saloon‭.‬ Be there at 5‭ ‬o'clock‭.‬ Ok‭.‬ ‭-‬What's your name‭?‬ ‭-‬O'Hara‭. ‬Gary O'Hara‭.‬ Peter‭...‬ How will Black Eye react when O'Hara tries to hand him over to the Sheriff‭?‬ I think he'll draw his gun‭.‬ Ciertamente‭.‬ So it's necessary to protect the kid‭.‬ If Black Eye pull his gun before an unarmed man‭...‬ With a murderer you don't need scruples‭.‬ I think the same‭.‬ We'll have a piece of land where we'll start our new lives‭.‬ Tonight all will be solved‭.‬ Wait for news of me before leaving‭.‬ I'm asking for just one more sacrifice‭.‬ But I can't wait to have you by my side‭.‬ O'Hara‭...‬ Black Eye arrived‭.‬ Alright‭.‬ Excuse me‭, ‬send this on the southern stagecoach‭.‬ I'm sorry‭, ‬but it already left‭.‬ The next one will leave in 15‭ ‬days‭.‬ Nevermind‭. ‬Thanks‭.‬ I'm ready‭.‬ Come‭.‬ Can you see‭?‬ He's there on the bar‭.‬ You're lucky‭, ‬he has his back to the door‭.‬ I'll pin him down before he notices it‭.‬ It can't look like an attack‭.‬ Tell him you're turning him over to the Sheriff so everybody can hear it‭.‬ That way he'll have time to draw his pistol‭.‬ Don't be afraid‭.‬ We're right behind you‭.‬ Ok‭.‬ Black Eye‭, ‬stay right where you are‭!‬ Raise your hands‭.‬ I'm turning you over to the Sheriff‭.‬ Raise you hands‭, ‬I said‭.‬ You‭?‬ Gary‭!‬ Gary‭...‬ Yes‭, ‬both dead‭.‬ Something must have happened in the saloon‭.‬ Follow me‭, ‬judge‭.‬ Who was it‭?‬ Good you came‭, ‬Sheriff‭.‬ Who was it‭?‬ This poor boy wanted to turn over Black Eye‭.‬ But Black Eye shot first‭.‬ Then James‭, ‬me and the others intervened‭.‬ Too late‭.‬ So you shot Black Eye‭?‬ Of course‭, ‬the other guy was unarmed‭.‬ It's true‭, ‬Sheriff‭.‬ That's what happened‭.‬ I didn't have the chance or I'd have killed that rat‭.‬ MacCory is honest‭.‬ But it's true that he and the others killed Blacked Eye‭.‬ What will you do‭, ‬Judge‭?‬ I think it's legitimate defense‭.‬ It's fair to defend an unarmed man if he's attacked‭.‬ ‭-‬You're all witnesses‭?‬ ‭-‬We've all seen it‭.‬ It's not McCory's fault‭.‬ That's right‭.‬ ‭-‬Yes‭, ‬that's right‭.‬ ‭-‬Alright‭.‬ No reason to procede‭.‬ Dispose of the bodies‭.‬ McCory‭, ‬come to my office‭.‬ ‭-‬You have to sign the declaration ‭-‬Alright‭.‬ Please‭, ‬Judge Take them outside‭.‬ Cheer up‭!‬ We won't let a couple of outlaws ruin the night‭.‬ Music‭, ‬Maestro‭! ‬Music‭!‬ Nothing‭, ‬no identification‭.‬ It's ok‭, ‬bury them‭.‬ Nice job to do at this hour‭.‬ Look‭, ‬another one with a sawed pistol‭.‬ Leave it‭, ‬southerners like that honor of arms‭.‬ Those look like southern migrants‭.‬ Fine‭, ‬they'll save us work‭.‬ Take them outside‭.‬ What's going on‭?‬ What do you want‭?‬ Let's go‭.‬ Take these too‭, ‬they're compatriots‭.‬ So now‭...‬ Get out‭!‬ Poor guys‭.‬ The hardest part of war is when it ends‭.‬ He's alive‭.‬ Almighty God‭, ‬a miracle saved him‭!‬ Look‭.‬ It stopped the bullet from reaching the heart‭.‬ ‭-‬Let's take'im back to the town‭.‬ ‭-‬Are you crazy‭?‬ Those who did this would kill him‭.‬ We'll take him to the West with us‭.‬ Fate wanted him to live‭.‬ Help me‭.‬ ‭-‬How's business‭?‬ ‭-‬Better each day‭.‬ You made a good deal financing me‭.‬ Good morning‭, ‬fellas‭.‬ Sorry‭, ‬Donaldson‭,‬ but I can't do anything for you‭.‬ I understand‭,‬ the bank can't wait‭.‬ That's right‭.‬ And we‭, ‬the landlords‭,‬ to pay our debts we'll have to sell our land‭.‬ And since nobody wants it you'll be able to buy it for just a few dimes‭.‬ There's no other solution‭.‬ I know‭.‬ Bandits kill our cattle‭,‬ steal our crops‭,‬ but you bank can't wait‭.‬ Just one day or two‭, ‬why not‭?‬ But not one day more‭.‬ Alright‭, ‬in a couple of days the debt will paid‭.‬ Allow me to doubt that‭.‬ Do you think you can sell all your fodder and wheat‭?‬ Exactly‭, ‬that's what I'll do‭.‬ And the others‭?‬ The smaller land owners‭?‬ We'll pay‭, ‬McCory‭.‬ You won't take our land away for a few miserable dollars‭.‬ Your game is over‭.‬ Someone will help us‭.‬ Who‭?‬ You‭?‬ Nevermind‭, ‬you'll get paid every penny‭.‬ Let's go‭.‬ James‭.‬ Go meet Brad at the border right away‭.‬ Tell him to gather all the men‭. ‬Go‭.‬ Peter‭.‬ I have a little job for you‭.‬ So‭?‬ We're softening him‭.‬ C'mon‭, ‬bastard‭! ‬Talk‭!‬ Stop‭!‬ Stop‭!‬ I'll talk‭.‬ What's in Donaldson's mind‭?‬ He has a friend‭.‬ A banker from Wisconsin‭.‬ He'll open a bank right here‭.‬ A bank with a gold reserve to pay our debts‭.‬ That's all I know‭, ‬I swear‭.‬ I know nothing else‭.‬ That's enough‭.‬ You don't need to speak no more‭.‬ Hey‭, ‬Brad‭.‬ It's the boss‭.‬ The men are ready with their uniforms‭.‬ ‭-‬Who's getting it now‭?‬ ‭-‬Donaldson's state‭.‬ Same job‭?‬ I want something else‭.‬ Donaldson's head‭.‬ It won't be easy‭.‬ He can resist a long time at his own house‭.‬ Just set fire to all and leave‭.‬ Once you're out it will be enough with two or three men‭.‬ Understood‭?‬ Alright‭, ‬boss‭.‬ You can count on us‭.‬ Get ready‭, ‬guys‭.‬ Goodbye‭.‬ The southerners‭! ‬The southerners‭!‬ The southerners are coming The bandits‭! ‬The bandits‭!‬ Quick‭, ‬take shelter‭.‬ Have the guns ready‭.‬ Quick‭.‬ Faster‭, ‬boys‭.‬ Let's go‭!‬ You three‭, ‬take out your uniform‭.‬ It's Donaldson's turn‭.‬ Don't miss‭.‬ We'll deal with him quickly‭.‬ We'll be back before it's dark‭.‬ Let's go‭!‬ Let's move quietly‭.‬ If they see us‭, ‬hide‭.‬ Do you know Donaldson‭?‬ ‭-‬Never saw him‭?‬ ‭-‬Then‭?‬ We must find him and follow our orders‭.‬ What the hell happened‭?‬ It looks like there was a war here‭.‬ Worse than that‭.‬ Southerners‭, ‬bandits‭.‬ And who are you‭?‬ Foreigners‭, ‬passing through‭.‬ I asked who are you‭?‬ Calm down‭, ‬my friend‭.‬ Are you the boss to be shouting orders‭?‬ No‭.‬ I am the boss‭.‬ Then‭, ‬we have to talk to you‭.‬ Speak‭.‬ Go on‭, ‬I'm listening‭.‬ As you wish‭.‬ You saved mi life‭. ‬Thanks‭.‬ ‭-‬Let's have a drink‭.‬ ‭-‬Of course‭.‬ My house is open for you‭.‬ The Sheriff and his men‭.‬ Tell him you kill those three bandits‭.‬ If you have anything to settle down with the law‭, ‬don't be afraid‭.‬ You're on the right side now‭.‬ I have things to settle down‭,‬ but not with the law‭.‬ You were lucky to escape‭, ‬Donaldson‭.‬ Congratulations‭.‬ ‭-‬What will you do now‭, ‬Sheriff‭?‬ ‭-‬What do you expect me to do‭?‬ When I reach the river‭,‬ I have to stop‭.‬ I can't change the borders‭.‬ Maybe those three will be waiting‭.‬ It's my only hope‭.‬ I if I find them‭, ‬they'll regret the day they were born‭.‬ To the horses‭!‬ Boss‭.‬ There's barely any wheat left and the fodder is all lost‭.‬ Damned bandits‭.‬ If only Black Eye was alive‭.‬ ‭-‬Why‭? ‬Did you know him‭?‬ ‭-‬Of course‭.‬ I convinced him to stay here‭.‬ He was a good man‭.‬ He was a brave man‭.‬ Bandits didn't dare to attack him‭.‬ I was told he was an outlaw‭.‬ An outlaw‭?‬ Him‭?‬ Who told you that‭?‬ Black Eye was the best ally of the land owners‭.‬ It's Black Eye‭.‬ Yes‭, ‬my brother‭.‬ What you just told me it's a truly amazing story‭.‬ It's clear that McCory it's involved in this‭.‬ Only he benefits from the bandits in this region And only he had an interest in his death‭.‬ Evidently‭, ‬my brother had his suspicions‭.‬ Now that you mention it‭,‬ Black Eye was here the day he was murdered‭.‬ He was happy‭.‬ He said he had discovered something that would be the end of our problems‭.‬ What‭?‬ We'll never know‭.‬ Before leaving‭,‬ he said he had a weapon a lot more powerful than his gun‭.‬ That night he died‭.‬ Maybe it was some paper‭,‬ a document‭.‬ That's it‭!‬ Black Eye found evidence that the bandits work for McCory‭.‬ Why didn't he use that proof then‭?‬ Because they killed him before he could do it‭.‬ Where did my brother live‭?‬ At an old state‭,‬ up north‭, ‬over the hills‭.‬ The big house‭.‬ The big house‭?‬ Thank you‭, ‬Donaldson‭. ‬That's very valuable information‭.‬ Do you think he hid some important document there‭?‬ There's one chance in a hundred‭,‬ but I won't waste it‭.‬ Excuse me‭, ‬when does the southern stagecoach arrive‭?‬ In at least 4‭ ‬or 5‭ ‬days‭.‬ Good‭, ‬that's enough time‭.‬ What are you planning‭?‬ Going to the big house‭.‬ I have to fin the evidence‭.‬ Joe‭!‬ Joe‭!‬ Where's he hiding‭?‬ Slept‭.‬ Is this how you stay on watch‭?‬ Let's go‭! ‬Get up‭!‬ Thanks‭, ‬buddy‭.‬ And with you there's six‭.‬ The seventh won't keep much longer‭.‬ He's the boss‭, ‬right‭?‬ Yes‭, ‬it's him‭.‬ Fine‭. ‬We'll wait for him‭.‬ Walk‭.‬ What happened‭?‬ You too get in‭.‬ Get in‭!‬ ‭-‬What do you want‭?‬ ‭-‬Who told you I want somethin‭?‬ If you wanted‭, ‬you could have killed us all‭.‬ You're right‭.‬ I had trouble in Wisconsin once because of a clerk who was a little deaf‭.‬ I think I can work well with you‭.‬ Here's my business card‭.‬ And this is a proof of my loyalty‭.‬ Untie the others‭.‬ If you accept me‭,‬ you'll be a lot more tranquil when you turn your back‭.‬ One fifth of the earnings and never argue my orders‭.‬ ‭-‬Deal‭.‬ ‭-‬That fifth was for me‭.‬ Shut up‭.‬ You let yourself be caught just like a turkey‭.‬ Because of this idiot‭.‬ He was at the window and could have shot‭.‬ Why didn't you shoot‭?‬ I could've hurt you‭.‬ You were afraid‭.‬ You had it right there‭,‬ you dirty southerner‭!‬ Stop‭!‬ You're a southerner just like him‭, ‬huh‭?‬ Yes‭, ‬but I'm not like him‭.‬ If I'm insulted‭, ‬I shoot‭.‬ You had your turn‭, ‬now it's mine‭.‬ Ok‭.‬ Captain O'Hara‭?‬ I could have killed you yesterday I didn't do it because I recognized you‭.‬ I'm from Richmond too‭.‬ Yes‭, ‬I was O'Hara‭.‬ But I wouldn't like you to spread it‭.‬ I know how to keep my mouth shut when I need to‭.‬ O'Hara is now a bandit‭.‬ And you‭? ‬Why are you a bandit‭?‬ Same as most‭.‬ I was a prisoner and fled with the help of a deserter‭.‬ The rest came along‭.‬ There's no honors for the defeated‭.‬ The honor belongs to you‭, ‬boy‭,‬ and no one can take it away‭.‬ But you're at the service of Brad too‭.‬ What are you doing in here‭?‬ We're talking‭. ‬Is it forbidden‭?‬ I told you‭, ‬Brad‭.‬ I can't trust you‭.‬ You're both southerners‭.‬ ‭-‬Watch your mouth‭.‬ ‭-‬Stop it‭!‬ Out‭.‬ The boss is coming‭.‬ The boss‭? ‬Who are you then‭?‬ The one who gives you orders‭.‬ I said out‭!‬ Good morning‭, ‬boss‭.‬ This is the new guy‭.‬ Haven't we met before‭?‬ Maybe‭.‬ He better be faster than that idiot Rex and his pals‭.‬ It's incredible‭. ‬Failing against Donaldson and getting killed‭!‬ The old man is a tough one‭.‬ Knows how to defend himself‭.‬ Don't say anymore‭.‬ Guys‭!‬ Get ready for the big hit‭.‬ Gold‭!‬ ‭-‬Did you say gold‭?‬ ‭-‬In ingots A friend of Donaldson will open a new bank at Yellowstone‭.‬ Tomorrow a stagecoach will arrive with the gold‭.‬ Fort Brest Sheriff's men will escort it‭.‬ But just up to the river‭.‬ Then they'll have to get through Falcon's Pass‭.‬ Then you'll attack‭.‬ In uniform as usual‭?‬ It's not important‭.‬ Dead men don't remember anything‭.‬ Boys‭! ‬Goodbye‭!‬ Quit playing that filthy southern music‭.‬ Play‭ ''‬Yankee Doodle‭''.‬ I play what I want‭.‬ I told you to play‭ ''‬Yankee Doodle‭''.‬ That was tha last bottle‭.‬ You did it on purpose‭.‬ You're wrong‭, ‬pal‭.‬ Without whisky I'm like a fish out of water‭.‬ I'm willing to fix it‭.‬ ‭-‬Where do you buy whisky‭?‬ ‭-‬There's a shop at the corner ‭-‬I'll go‭, ‬then‭.‬ ‭-‬No‭.‬ Not you‭.‬ You can just pay it‭.‬ Going out it's too much‭.‬ What's wrong‭?‬ Don't you trust me‭?‬ I didn't say that‭,‬ I just said you're not going‭.‬ You go‭.‬ It's less suspicious‭.‬ At least‭, ‬let me pay‭.‬ Hey‭, ‬boy‭.‬ Listen‭.‬ For the second time‭,‬ you life depend on me‭.‬ I'm not a outlaw‭.‬ I never thought you were‭, ‬captain‭.‬ Donaldson is my friend‭.‬ Go tell him what you know‭.‬ I'm not a traitor‭.‬ You have to‭.‬ I know honor is a vain word for you‭.‬ Stop‭! ‬Leave me alone‭!‬ You have to go‭.‬ Hey‭, ‬you two‭!‬ What's this‭? ‬Family life‭?‬ We were talking about whisky‭.‬ I like it Virginian‭.‬ Do you agree‭?‬ Agreed‭.‬ Wait here‭.‬ Hello‭, ‬Donaldson‭.‬ We're about to leave‭.‬ We have to change our plan‭, ‬Sheriff‭.‬ The bandits will attack the gold cargo at Falcon's Pass‭.‬ ‭-‬How do you know‭?‬ ‭-‬For once‭, ‬I beat you at your job‭.‬ What will you do‭?‬ Me and my men will go with you‭.‬ We'll go through the underpass‭.‬ Once the gold is safe you can go to Falcon's Pass‭.‬ The bandits we'll be waiting for the gold‭,‬ but instead you'll fill'em with lead‭.‬ What you say‭?‬ Yes‭.‬ Yes‭.‬ Seems a good idea‭.‬ What's going on here‭?‬ Damn me‭!‬ Since when do you arrive three days in advance‭?‬ I have 8‭ ‬daughters‭.‬ If it's a boy I want to be there‭.‬ If it's like that‭...‬ Welcome‭, ‬Ma'am‭.‬ ‭-‬Is there any hotel here‭?‬ ‭-‬Yes‭, ‬right there‭. ‬The Belle Star‭.‬ Watch my luggage‭, ‬please‭.‬ Of course‭.‬ Beautiful girl‭.‬ If she was at the saloon‭,‬ our income would triple‭.‬ Beautiful and alone in a border town‭.‬ Weird for a lady‭.‬ Why don't you go see‭?‬ You never know‭.‬ Excuse me‭.‬ Do you know Mr‭. ‬O'Hara‭?‬ Gary O'Hara‭?‬ ‭-‬Who are you‭?‬ ‭-‬I'm his wife‭.‬ You mean the one‭...‬ ‭-‬With the beard‭?‬ ‭-‬Yes‭, ‬that's right‭!‬ Actually‭...‬ ‭-‬O'Hara's wife‭?‬ ‭-‬Yes‭.‬ It's a pleasure meeting you‭.‬ Come‭, ‬I'll walk you‭.‬ ‭-‬Thank you‭.‬ ‭-‬Come‭.‬ Please‭, ‬Ma'am‭.‬ ‭-‬Look how she's dressed‭.‬ ‭-‬Who could she be‭?‬ Come over here‭.‬ What a beauty‭!‬ Must be a new addition‭.‬ Hey‭, ‬sweetheart‭!‬ Come‭, ‬we'll buy you a drink‭.‬ Go up‭, ‬please‭.‬ Over here‭, ‬please‭.‬ Very well‭, ‬Peter‭.‬ ‭-‬Way better than I expected‭.‬ ‭-‬Wait a moment‭, ‬Mac‭.‬ The lady is Gary O'Hara's wife‭.‬ Gary O'Hara‭?‬ Please‭.‬ ‭-‬Come in‭.‬ ‭-‬Thanks‭.‬ Take a sit‭.‬ ‭-‬Did you have a long travel‭?‬ ‭-‬Yes‭, ‬from Virginia‭.‬ Why did you come to Yellowstone‭?‬ Do you know that‭...?‬ What‭?‬ I had to meet Gary here‭.‬ Your husband was a good man‭.‬ A brave man‭.‬ Was‭?‬ What do you mean‭?‬ You have to be strong‭, ‬Ma'am‭.‬ Nonetheless‭...‬ Why‭? ‬What happened to my husband‭?‬ He's dead‭.‬ Dead‭?‬ No‭...‬ It's not possible‭.‬ It's not possible‭!‬ I can't be true‭!‬ Gary‭...‬ Gary was working for the law‭.‬ An outlaw‭, ‬one called Black Eye‭...‬ He was murdered‭?‬ Yes‭, ‬here‭, ‬at the saloon‭.‬ At a fight‭.‬ He killed him cowardly‭.‬ All the town mourned him‭.‬ And where‭...?‬ Where's he buried‭?‬ Actually‭...‬ Peter‭.‬ Do you know anything‭?‬ No‭.‬ Call James‭.‬ How is it possible‭?‬ You say you mourned him but don't even know where he's buried‭.‬ I don't think he's dead‭.‬ Yet‭, ‬there's no doubt about it‭.‬ You're lying‭.‬ You're hiding something‭.‬ What's the truth‭?‬ I have a right to know‭.‬ Please calm down‭, ‬Ma'am‭.‬ ‭-‬I'm here‭.‬ ‭-‬James‭.‬ If I remember right‭,‬ didn't you bury Gary O'Hara‭?‬ Of course‭.‬ The lady wants to know where was his husband buried‭.‬ Take her with you‭, ‬James‭.‬ You know where‭.‬ Alright‭.‬ Please‭.‬ We'll comfort the widow ourselves‭.‬ Come on‭, ‬walk‭.‬ What the hell is going on‭?‬ This southern pig went to see Donaldson‭.‬ Don't you move‭!‬ Where do you think you're going‭?‬ He sent him‭, ‬they're associated‭.‬ No‭!‬ He has nothing to do with it‭.‬ It was my idea‭.‬ And you‭, ‬what you have to say‭?‬ It's your duty to judge‭.‬ If I wanted to kill them‭,‬ I'd had done it the first time‭.‬ I had them on the palm of my hand‭.‬ If you're with us‭, ‬prove it‭.‬ I'll give you the honor of killing this damned spy‭.‬ I'm not like you‭.‬ I don't kill unarmed men‭.‬ It's no fun‭.‬ Give him a gun and I'll kill him like a rabbit‭.‬ Ok‭.‬ Hey you‭.‬ Give them two rifles‭.‬ Did you have fun‭?‬ You're an idiot‭.‬ On the other hand‭, ‬you're not‭.‬ You know what you want‭.‬ Now I want to know what you're looking for‭.‬ Hey‭, ‬you‭.‬ Speak‭!‬ Speak‭!‬ Speak‭!‬ Leave it to me‭.‬ Let's go‭.‬ I told you to speak‭.‬ Speak‭!‬ Stop for now‭. ‬He passed out‭.‬ Let's kill him and finish this at once‭.‬ After he talks‭.‬ Tie him and stuff his mouth with salt‭.‬ When we come back‭, ‬for one drop of water he'll give us a river of words‭.‬ Slim‭, ‬watch the southerner‭.‬ And now‭, ‬boys‭, ‬let's think about the gold‭. ‬Get ready‭.‬ ‭-‬So far away‭?‬ ‭-‬We're almost there‭.‬ Brad‭...‬ Look who's coming‭.‬ Who's her‭?‬ A very special guest‭,‬ McCory's property‭.‬ Let's go‭!‬ Leave her‭.‬ She belongs to the boss‭.‬ Take her inside and tie her‭.‬ She'll have do no more whims‭.‬ Easy‭, ‬Brad‭.‬ I'll take care of it‭.‬ Let's go‭, ‬beauty‭.‬ I said let's go‭!‬ Leave me‭!‬ Let go of me‭!‬ Let go of me‭!‬ Walk‭!‬ Judy‭...‬ Judy‭!‬ He's my partner from Fort Best‭.‬ He didn't make us wait one minute‭.‬ Great‭. ‬It's our turn‭, ‬Sheriff‭.‬ There's enough gold there to solve all of our problems‭.‬ Stop‭!‬ Hey‭, ‬guys‭.‬ How about taking some rest and having a drink‭?‬ Great idea‭.‬ It's a great day and we have to celebrate‭.‬ You go first‭.‬ McCory will be happy now‭.‬ Hey‭, ‬you‭, ‬take the carriage and pick up Brad at Falcon's Pass‭.‬ C'mon‭, ‬boys‭. ‬Let's have a drink‭.‬ It's on Donaldson‭.‬ You're free now‭.‬ Are you glad‭?‬ No‭! ‬No‭! ‬Don't get any closer‭!‬ No‭! ‬Coward‭!‬ Are you afraid‭?‬ I'm not going to hurt to you‭.‬ No‭! ‬Let go of me‭!‬ Leave me‭!‬ Judy‭...‬ Judy‭...‬ Gary‭...‬ Let's get away‭, ‬Gary‭.‬ He'll come back at any moment‭.‬ You looked everywhere‭.‬ There's nothing‭.‬ If Phil had any evidence‭,‬ it has to be around here‭.‬ Who cares‭? ‬You know the truth already‭.‬ The Sheriff won't take a southerner's word against the most important citizen of Yellowstone‭.‬ Gary‭!‬ The bandits are coming Come‭.‬ Come‭.‬ Find the Sheriff and tell him to come right now‭.‬ And you‭?‬ I'll think of something‭. ‬Go‭!‬ They won't see you‭.‬ Quick‭! ‬Go‭!‬ Go see if our friend is ready to talk‭.‬ Alright‭, ‬boss‭.‬ Want some‭?‬ Or would you rather have some more salt‭?‬ Talk‭!‬ You'll pay for this‭.‬ What happened to your husband‭?‬ He stayed there‭.‬ He helped me to escape‭.‬ You have to hurry‭.‬ His life depends on that‭.‬ Stay calm‭, ‬Ma'am‭.‬ After everything you told me I'm not wasting a second‭.‬ Sheriff‭!‬ Excuse me‭.‬ ‭-‬So‭?‬ ‭-‬McCory is going to the state‭.‬ Damn‭!‬ Someone must warn him‭.‬ Take this woman to McCory's‭.‬ We'll take care of it later‭.‬ You three‭, ‬come with me‭.‬ The Sheriff too‭.‬ Judy‭...‬ ‭-‬What happened‭?‬ ‭-‬A massacre‭.‬ Looked over there‭.‬ It's a miracle I'm alive‭.‬ Who did it‭?‬ The Sheriff‭.‬ He killed them all and ran away with the gold‭.‬ Traitor‭!‬ He thinks he's fooling me‭, ‬huh‭?‬ He'll pay for this‭.‬ Dead‭. ‬And all the rest too‭.‬ ‭-‬And the southerner‭?‬ ‭-‬He escaped‭.‬ Escaped‭.‬ And the gold‭?‬ Listen‭. ‬If someone comes‭, ‬shoot‭.‬ Here's the gold‭.‬ Fortunately‭, ‬the southerner didn't touch it‭.‬ You‭...‬ Yeah‭, ‬me‭.‬ The southerner warned me‭.‬ You crazy idiot‭.‬ We could've shared the gold‭.‬ Now it'll be only mine‭.‬ The southerner‭...‬ He cheated us‭. ‬Both of us‭.‬ That man‭...‬ He‭...‬ Is‭...‬ Who‭!?‬ ‭-‬Where are you going‭?‬ ‭-‬Stop him‭, ‬James‭.‬ Quick‭, ‬follow him‭.‬ Fast‭!‬ Where's Judy‭?‬ I don't know‭.‬ I know nothing‭. ‬I swear‭.‬ Let the men mount guard‭.‬ Shoot anyone who comes‭.‬ Watch it‭. ‬O'Hara's widow is inside‭.‬ ‭-‬How can it be‭?‬ ‭-‬The Sheriff sent her‭.‬ The Sheriff‭?‬ Guys‭.‬ You go there‭, ‬you go in the back‭.‬ How did you escape‭?‬ That southern pig‭, ‬huh‭?‬ Yes‭, ‬and he'll kill you all‭.‬ So that's how it goes‭, ‬right‭?‬ My men will take care of him‭.‬ Talk or I'll kill you‭.‬ Where's she‭?‬ In the house of McCory‭.‬ Here I am‭.‬ Come‭. ‬He won't shoot at you‭.‬ Let's go‭.‬ Quick‭, ‬get up‭.‬ Get up‭!‬ Watch out‭!‬ Let me go‭! ‬Let me go‭!‬ Stay quiet‭.‬ Or it's you who'll die‭.‬ Stop there or I'll kill her‭.‬ Drop your gun‭.‬ No‭, ‬give it to me‭.‬ Throw the other one too‭.‬ Now get over here‭.‬ You recognize me now‭?‬ O'Hara‭!‬ Yes‭, ‬in the flesh‭.‬ I owe my life to this‭.‬ It was Black Eye's‭.‬ My brother‭!‬ There's one bullet left‭.‬ And at this distance‭.‬ I can't miss‭.‬ Gary‭! ‬Gary‭!‬ Leave him‭.‬ It's Yellowstone's turn to deliver justice‭.‬
