I'm Michael Stone and I'm just gonna go ahead and jump right in to here. Now I'm sure you've heard about some of the chaos that went down in Madison last month. The police incident that spurred multiple protests intensifying over the next passing days culminating in that faithful night on June 8th but you haven't heard the entire story have you? Because until now, the entire story hasn't been visible. The events of June 8th were an enormous provocateur staged attack on the people of Madison implemented by major institutions within our own very system. right into the middle of this story that the mainstream media outlets have published is so misinformed and so full of propaganda, disgusting, truly. But thanks to the outstanding and diligent effort of my field reporter Tessa Monroe, we have in our possession, first hand account of that night and what actually happened. Now, to reiterate, at every branch, at every level within this machine, they do not want this video circulating at every level, they got something to hide and at every level, they are doing their best to prevent you from seeing what is truly going on. But tonight, you're gonna have a chance to see the truth and forge your own opinion. Now, be aware, some of this footage is violent and very disturbing, viewer discretion is advised, so put the kids to bed, dim the lights and get ready for this never before seen footage of these events from Madison. Hey Mark, check this out. Mark, look there's like these icicles, they're enormous. Hey, how old do you think this is? Wait what? I can't hear you. - Mark - The signals really bad, - you're going in and... - Jeez. Steph? Stephanie, Stephanie. - Mark, get off your phone. - What? What year do you think this became a park? I don't know, what do I look like Indiana Jones? Hey, he was an archeologist, not a geologist. Whatever, when did you get so interested - in all of this anyway? - Since forever. Wow, thanks for noticing the past two decades. Well poor little baby brother didn't get enough attention. Stop, stop. Seriously though dude, if I was half as smart as you, I'd start looking into something a little more beneficial, you know what I mean? - Such as? - I don't know, a doctor, scientist, a lawyer because something man. Well, I'm still young, you know, I have a shot at it unlike some people. - So now I'm the old fart? - Just saying. Dude, look don't worry about me alright? Once my business idea takes off, the whole family's not gonna have to worry about anything every again. Steph and I are getting married. Married, to your girlfriend of nine months? - A year, alright? - Uh huh. We get mom and dad a nice house, some cool cars, you can live in my basement. I am not living in a basement. Whoa, dude, dude it's gonna be the nicest basement you've ever seen, really, I mean a pool table, fuse ball, cute little race car bed. race care bed, great thanks. But actually, that's one of the reasons - I wanted to take this trip. - For a race car bed? No dude seriously, I mean my business. I know we've talked about it and mom and dad and I know that you're not thrilled with it. - Wait you asked them? - They offered. - You said no right? - No. How can you be so selfish, Mark? - I'm not being selfish. - Yes you are, you're being selfish. How is that being selfish? They don't have the money for it. - Money's not the issue. - Yes it is the issue. If it was an issue they wouldn't have offered. You're just doing this for you. I'm not doing it just for me, I'm doing it for all of us - because Steph said that - No it doesn't matter what Steph said, she's not family. Forgot your camera. Okay here it goes. Alright Ash, I know that you don't like birthday presents and I know you also hate being on camera but I promise this is strictly for personal use. I swear I will not put this on my channel unless, of course, I say something funny. Oh and also I borrowed your SD card, I hope that's not a problem. Hey, there he is, hey! No I get it Donny, but seriously I'll open it but not everything has to go on your stupid channel okay? What, c'mon man, can't I film my best friend opening his birthday present without being accused of trying to get views? Dude just open it up, I think you're gonna like it. It's a, yeah, it's a It's a new head mountain 1080P POV camera man! Yeah, it is, yeah, I love it man, yeah, just what I wanted You hate it. Oh my god, I knew it. That was just stupid, stupid me, I was just wanted to get a camera and I thought we could make videos together like we used to but you know what I still have the receipt, we can just return it, I'll take it back. No Donny, Donny, seriously it's cool I like it. - You sure? - Yeah man, it's awesome I can't wait to try it out. Alright then, let's get this bad boy opened. I didn't mean right now. Here take the camera. Guys, Donny D coming at you live with a new unboxing and tech review today. Donny, seriously? No We have an amazing, we have an amazing. It doesn't look terrible. I'm glad you're enjoying this. No dude I'm serious, look. See, it's cool on, you look like you're from the future. Alright look, I'll wear it today but only because it'll make for some cool home video or whatever. Understood, completely understood. Purely for family-oriented documentation purposes only. - But we better get going. - We still have time. Dude, it's almost three. Well why are you in such a hurry? Why aren't you? Mark is your brother and you guys haven't seen each other in forever. Yeah, there's a reason for that. Look dude, all I'm saying is if I had a brother and then for whatever reason we quit talking and then years down the road I had the opportunity to be the bigger man, I would take it. Life's too short to hold grudges. It's not a grudge man. Mark and I's relationship it's not like you and your imaginary brother, okay? What happened between him and my family and me, it's in the past but forgive me if I'm reluctant to take a trip down memory lane even if it is my birthday. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. That's alright man, I was just a little wound up that's all. Just relax okay? It'll be fine. I'll be there, Mark's wife will be there. - Fiance. - Well whatever. - Are you cool? - Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna be fine. And you're wrong, you do have a brother. Alright, I'm your brother. Wow, that was kind of weird man. Wait a minute, wait a minute, I know where I've seen that before, where I've heard that. Donny, Donny, I am your brother - Where are my keys? - Brother. Seriously, where are my keys? I have no idea, I don't live here. - And there, wait hold on, no - Stop. I got it Ash, stop leave it alone. Why do you need to have it on right now? Dude, we're gonna wanna film this, come on. Residents of Madison, when will we be silenced? Never! When will we surrender? Never! Dude it's that chick from the news. When shall we be free? What's she doing? Take back your country, follow me! I wish could. - Let's get outta here. - Do you have any idea how cool it would be if I had a channel like that? Now say it again. Oh come on, what're you doing, turn that off. - Say it! - I'm not gonna say it. - You look nice. - Nice? You say it again or I will make a huge scene right here. You heard me, come on what more do you want? - Marcus Whitmore! - Shh, shh! - What do you want from me? - Say it. Okay, okay, Stephanie, you're the most gorgeous fiance a man could ever ask for. I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have you in my life. You're my one and only. - And? - And I'm your Marcusaurus. - My what? - You heard me, come on. - I want you to yell it. - I'm not gonna yell it. I will post this all over your wall and your friends will see just how macho you really are. I'm you're Marcusaurus Rex! See, when's your brother supposed to be here? Soon I guess. Dude, all I'm saying is if I had that many viewers I would have sponsors lining up around the block to give me money. Yeah Donny, I get it but would you really wanna stoop that low? Wait you're serious? - Yeah. - Did you hear that? What the heck are you doing man? It's that woman from the news. Man she really knows her stuff. Hey, what're you doing in my garage kid? Sorry man I was just checking out your radio Yeah beat feet, get outta here, out. - Sorry. - We're just listening - Out, bye. - Okay. - Bye, bye - My friend's crazy. Alright, we're going, we're gone. Are you nuts man? What is this? A mechanic shop in Nazi Germany. They're here, Ash is here, be nice. You really think you should be filming this? - Hey Ash. - Hey, it's good to see you again. Happy birthday little brother. Mark, how are you doing? - What's this? - That my friend - is a brand spanking new 1080P - It's a gift. - You must be Donny. - Yeah, what's up Mark? How you doing? Heard a lot of good things about you. Yeah, I've heard a lot of, you too. Hey Ash, I'm sorry I wanted to get you something but with the wedding and everything. - It's fine. - Money's just tight right now - It's okay, really. - Where's mom and dad? They're out of town visiting Aunt Sherri. They didn't know I was coming? Well with work and everything it just must've slipped my mind. Hey, does anybody want some birthday muffins? Yes, that is great, I could definitely go for some muffins right now. When in Rome. So Donny, what do you do? Well I am an internet celebrity. - Oh really? - He wishes. So you make like videos and stuff? - Yeah, mostly tech related. - You get paid for that right? I mean how is that even work? Well usually big sponsors will pay you to run ads and promote them on your channel. Oh, so you can actually make pretty good money then? Well, yeah theoretically but it's a little bit of a work in progress. You gotta get a big audience, get a lot of viewers, that sort of thing. Everything is potentially public domain with Donny. - Really? - If he thinks it'll get him views, he'll record it. So you're saying, even I'm not safe? No, you are most definitely not safe. What, come on dude. You can give me a little bit of credit. No one's safe. So Ash, you still thinking about law school? No as it turns out I can't afford it. I know that feeling, Mark's business closed two years ago and we're still feeling the pinch. Can't afford our dream wedding. - Steph, let's not. - What? Mark, you're an entrepreneur. Your first business didn't work out, it's not a big deal everyone came out unharmed. - Stephanie. - What? Yeah, what's wrong Mark? Everyone came out unharmed. She didn't know, alright let's just drop it okay? - Didn't know what? - Nothing, okay? We'll talk about it later. No let's talk about it now, you tell her. - Just cool it, man. - Tell me what? You really wanna do this here? - Mark. - Oh, he's just bein shy Guess he never told you how he was able to afford to open that business, right? Ash let's just step outside for a second. Must've never shared the fact that his parents invested their retirement and put up their house for a loan and all because of his willingness to gamble their security with his ignorance in running a business, - they lost everything. - You watch your mouth. Or what, Mark? What else you gonna try and take away from me huh? After you bankrupted mom and dad and left for two years, I was left to pick up the pieces. I gave up my dreams, my life goals, all so I could get a nine to five to help pay for mom and dad's one bedroom apartment on 6th. - We're leaving. - Oh, what a surprise! Mark, you're running away again. Don't worry about paying for the coffee, I'm used to bailing you out. - You know what, you little - No you listen to me. Just tell the truth, Mark. You didn't come back for my birthday, you haven't been to one of my birthdays since I was 12. You need mommy and daddy again. What is it, another half baked scheme, another get rich quick scam? Oh, you need money for that dream wedding don't you? Oh, that's great, we wouldn't want you to miss out on any of the fancy amenities. Is that true? Mark? Yeah, I think that's about... - Donny. - Go. Okay, jeez just trying to help. Sorry for the disturbance people. Go back to your coffees, nothing to see here. Hey Ash, wait up man. - Not now Donny. - Look, maybe just calm down a little bit? You seriously gonna tell me to calm down right now? Alright, you're right my bad I'm sorry. It's just, look at it this way man, it's good to get all your feelings out in the open. Feel any better? Come on, how do you feel? - A little better actually. - See, I told you. It's soul cleansing, it's cathartic. - Look I'll be fine, alright? - Alright, good. Well, they're definitely not gonna let us back in there but I'll go grab the other two and tell them that - Ow, ow, what is that? - Get inside. - What was that? - We don't know. - You okay? - Yeah, Donny? Yeah, I think so, you guys ever hear anything like that? Never. What even makes a noise like that? I don't know but we gotta get outta here. Ash, your place is nearby right? - Yeah, yeah, up the street - You hear that? Dude I can't hear anything right now. - Mark, we gotta go. - Quiet. Yeah, I think I hear it too. There's nothing out here. I don't see anything, you guys see anything? - Donny. - Sorry. Maybe it was like a really loud car alarm or something. - Psht, car alarm? - I don't know, it would've scared me away. What is this? Guys? - Physically harmful? - Does that mean us too? Oh my god. - Oh my god what do we do? - Go, move move. Stick together. Get down. Go, move, move. Okay, what the hell is going on? Ash, you wanted to be the law student, - can they do all that? - I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I mean I don't know, it's not like I spend a whole lot of time going over the rules of civilian warfare, alright? - Enough. - Why the hell does a small town like this even have all that gear? I mean they had a fricken tank. Okay, okay this has to be protocol right? I mean, they are the good guys, they know what's legal, they're probably just trying to get the bad guys off the street and we happened to be stuck in the middle. - Ash it's her. - This is Tessa Monroe and I'm in the city of Madison where it has finally happened. Ladies and gentlemen, you're right to free speech has been revoked. The tyrannical police state has begun its assault and there is no end in sight. Hey, what the hell did you do? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, cool it. - You think we did this? Well you're the conspiracy theory nut. He doesn't mean nut. You see it out there. I've reported on people losing their freedoms for years and I don't know why now, but I do know this is the biggest, most blatant crack down ever and I could probably guess they're not going to stop. Wait, what do you mean, they're not gonna stop? They'll stop when they get the criminals off the street. Sweetie, if you think they're the solution, you have no idea what the problem is. Alright, so what're you saying? I'm saying if you had any sense, you'd get the hell out of town before things get any worse. - Worse? - Civil War response manual. L3G20? Maybe you should pay more attention to what your government does and less to your social media pages. - Enlighten us. - It's one of those documents passed under the radar that dictates their exact course of action in the case of a domestic terrorism attack. Wait wait wait wait you guys are protestors, not terrorists. Under these laws and documents, everyone is a terrorist. This is ridiculous. Believe what you wanna believe but I'm taking my crew and we're getting the hell outta here feel free to tag along. - Hey, wait up. - What are you doing? I think maybe we should go with her? - Are you insane? - No, it's just look, obviously she knows her stuff right? You might be safer with her, that's all. No Ash is right, we just need to go home and wait for this to blow over. - I don't know. - Yeah, I'm not buying into this just because you wanna tag along with her and be her intern or whatever. - Okay, come on. - We're going. - Excuse me? - You said, mom and dad are outta town, alright? So we go, we meet up with them, make sure they don't come back early and wander into this mess. Worst case scenario, we look a little paranoid, you get to spend the rest of your birthday with your whole family. Come on. Save those batteries. Guns fight enemies, cameras can fight tyrannies. And yet somehow, I wouldn't feel safer with either. I'm sorry Erin, Erin, just pause this for a second, okay? Sorry folks, but I didn't wanna bite my tongue for too much longer and miss the opportunity to add in some new information we recently gathered. For the past few months, we've been reporting that there were drills taking place weeks before the events of June 8th and just now, the corporate news outlets are reporting the same. The Dispatch: Routine Crowd Control Drills take place in Madison Last May. I mean, there were events taken place, drills taken place in Madison weeks before those incidents broke out and that's from the press okay? They were training how to handle a city wide event like the one that happened and how to prepare for a Marshall law type atmosphere but their denials of that? I mean, that just shows that they got something to hide. This is big folks, this is real big I mean this is the most we have ever been in because we are following this trail and it is hot. Folks, it is red hot but we have a lot more information and a very special guest star in our studio in a little bit so let's get back to the footage, Erin go ahead. Roll it again. So tell me again, why we're walking? Because your girlfriend wants to keep a low profile. Girlfriend. Please, I just happen to respect a fellow journalist that's all. - Yeah. - Why, did she say something about me? Where is everybody? Yeah, probably at home where we should be. Why can't you just listen to me for once? Think they'll ever stop arguing? Yeah, not as long as they are both breathing. Yeah, hey Ash. Okay, I'm not saying we need to trust her but we can use her to help us get out of Madison. We can find a way out of our own town ourselves. Yeah, and we might find ourselves in the middle of another war again. Alright, she can help us get outta here without finding anymore trouble. For all we know, she is the trouble. Ash, look I think Mark's right man. - Stay out of this Donny. - Dude, what's your deal? Alright, you hate me. Alright, I get that. But you're so wrapped up in it that you'd really put everyone here in danger, for what? To prove you don't need your big brother looking over your shoulder? Oh you think you know everything don't you? Oh my god, why are you here then? Huh, you're a big boy, why don't you just go home? You know what, maybe I will. Okay, come on guys. It's time for you to quit complaining. You know what, when you're in jail to. Oh will you? Oh, I'll send you a postcard from mom and dads. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, after you come up off your high horse and grow the fuck up little brother. Stop it, alright? I'm not gonna listen to this the whole way there, okay? If you two can't get alone, we will turn around right now and no one will go anywhere. You know what I mean. Hey, we're not alone. - What did she say? - Come on. Okay, go ahead. This is Tessa Monroe and I'm here in the city of Madison the epicenter of this new world order. Becca! Ops, I'm sorry sweetie are you okay? I'm fine. I told you stay with me, what happened? I'm sorry, I bumped into her, it's my fault. - It's okay, excuse us. - Ma'am. Don't you think she's a little young to be out proesting? We're not protestors, come on Becky. So you think we should've stayed? Hey ma'am, what's going on? They're not allowing anyone out of the city. - They can't do that. - Tessa, - wait up, hey. - Come on. Everyone will be allowed through shortly. Just give us time to set up the verification process. Who do you think you are? We're not cattle. We're not sheep. Tessa's getting pretty feisty again. We have the right to travel unmolested. Donny, tell your boss to shut up. Very funny, you wish. Whoa whoa, crap. Do you want to shoot us? Go ahead, shoot us. Ah, she doesn't really mean that. Please don't shoot us! They're rubber bullets. Get on the ground now. Get down you're under arrest - Now what? - We can head to Ventura Avenue, I mean this is the only way out of town. Well if they have this blocked off they could have everything blocked off. So we're just trapped here? Hey, what's the matter with you? Look! I said, people back. Mark we have to do something. Shut up, I don't wanna hear it. Stephanie, Stephanie. Please we have to do something. Are you okay sweetie? - Stay here. - Mark. Mark, what are you doing? - Mark! - No, Mark! Mark, no no. So how far is this waterfall? Not much further, alright it's right up here? How'd you find out about it? Known about it for a while, I think you'll like it. Cool, I'm having a lot of fun so far. Dude, I know we're in the woods and all, but I didn't expect you to get all sappy too. Get it? Trees, sap? Alright, okay you're done, you're done. Come on man. Sap! There's not even any sap in these trees. Well look at Ashie, you so smart, wow. Alright, alright, you're done, alright. I'll meet up with you at the falls. I think we made him mad. Hey, wait up Ash, Ash! Do we need to amputate? Just shut up and help me up Okay, how do you shut this thing off? Just set it down and help me, come on. Fine, well hold up. You okay? - Yeah. - Take it easy. It's just a little yeah, I'm fine. I feel like this would be some big brother, little brother teachable moment here. - Is that so? - Yeah. 'Cause dude, you know, family, family comes first and look I know it sounds cheesy but that's what mom and dad taught us. Family should always be there for one another especially when we fall, be there to help each other out. And I'll always be there for you man, always. And second, probably most important of all, I'll be there to laugh at you when you do something stupid like that. Dude, come on let's go, grab your camera. So your mom's a doctor? Yeah, so she's not home that much but it's okay, I guess. What about your dad? John, I don't know. He works for the government as a translator or something like that. He and my mom split up when I was young. We were actually on our way to D.C. to meet him before all this. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. Do you have any brothers or sisters? Nope. That must be tough, being alone all the time. Not really, I grew up pretty fast. Yeah, I can see that. You're a pretty strong girl. How long have you lived in Madison? I know you feel like you have some responsibility to keep me safe or keep my mind off what happened but you don't. - I can take care of myself. - Okay. - Can I interview you? - Go ahead, ask away. Maybe I'll even learn something, just send me the link so that I can put in on my channel too. You have a government truth channel? Yeah, but it's actually more sort of a technology truth kind of a thing. That's cool, so you knew all about those LRADs then today, that didn't surprise you at all. The what? The long range acoustic devices, the LRADs. Oh yeah right. Yeah those LRADs. Yeah that's crazy right? I never heard anything like that before. Well except for when I researched it to find out what it was but yeah I tried to warn the other guys, but they wouldn't listen. You know I really respect those of us who pay attention to what's going on in this world. Yeah well, that's totally me. The world needs more like you, Donny. Ah, come one, so my turn. How did you get so many followers? Wait first I wanna ask you more about your research in the government tech developments so tell me what you know about CTGWs, HD's, militarized max. Militarized max, CT, yeah well the last time I researched it and looked into it, what I found was, hey, what? What'd you say? You called me. - You need me over there? - No? I didn't hear him say anything. It's just he does that all the time, it's like an inside joke that he does but we should probably go checkout what he wants, come on. Rain check on the whole interview thing okay? Okay? Can you please talk some sense into your friend? Why, what's going on? He wants to go to the police station and quote "demand the release of Mark and Becca's mom." What? Ash are you crazy? No, I'm not crazy okay? This is me logically trying to solve a problem okay? No, if you go to the police station, the only thing that will happen is you will get arrested too - Dude, she's right. - Tessa, you said cameras fight tyranny, right? So we go down there, we show them the footage, and we show the captain what their psycho, we show the captain what those psychos did and we get justice. No we get a lawyer to get justice. Justice only happens when those who are intact are as indignant as those who are injured. What? Look, what I'm saying is we can't expect help from anyone who doesn't believe what's going on here is wrong in the first place and I really don't think the cops understand that what they're doing is wrong. Wait so we do nothing, that's your plan? No, I'm saying the opposite. We have to act now and fast, but going to the police for help, that's pointless. Okay Ash, Mark would not want this, you know that. - Mark's not here right now. - Yeah and you won't be either if you go with her. Okay, you had the right idea earlier, we never should've gone with her in the first place. Yeah, well now we need her. - No Ash! - Guys! My phone's not working. Let me see. All the channels are out. Whoa, what was that? - The phones are out. - Wait, so there's no TV, no lights, no service. They hit the kill switch, they're cutting us off from the rest of the country. Why? So that they can control what information is released. - No, we need to go. - Go where? I'm not leaving without my mom. There's no where to go, it's too late we're not getting out of town now. Okay, I'm going. - What's her deal? - I don't know, she's just upset okay? Look, I'm sorry, I am, you were right, alright? We should've just went back to my apartment after the coffee shop but you saw what they did alright? We can't just sit back and do nothing, alright? He's my brother. What do you think Mark would say, if he knew what you were doing right now? Well I don't know but I don't need yours or his permission I'm doing this. Okay, I love Mark just as much as you. - See that's the problem. - What, that I love Mark? No that you love Mark and he knows you do. Come on Ash, Mark knows you love him and you know he'd do anything to keep you safe. Well now I get to return the favor. No, no okay, Mark can still walk out of this okay, but that doesn't happen if you end up in prison or jail okay that's not a happy ending. Your brother isn't at the police station but if you wanna find him, we need to hurry. - Why? - Move. There's a good angle over there. - Are you sure? - You want viewers, - right? - Yeah. - Go. - Okay. Oh god. They can't do that. Tessa what are they doing? Looks like they're rounding up civilians. What is going on? Look at him. Don't move. I said don't move. - Hey you, freeze. - Jesus. Shit, I don't think they're using rubber bullets. Show me your hands, show me your hands. Hands where I can see them. If they have my mom. We're gonna get you your mom, - she's gonna be okay, alright? - What the hell Tessa, if Marks not at the police station, he's probably wherever they're taking those people right now. I believe so. Steph, First connects with High, High connects with Ventura right? Uh, yeah, yeah why? If we cross the street here, we can go down the side alley and then we can meet up with the trunk and follow it the rest of the way. No, if we cross now, the soldiers are gonna see us and we'll get scraped off the pavement. Well we don't have any other choice. He's right, if we're gonna do this we have to go now. Becca, you think you can do this? - I'll be fine. - Alright, we stay low and we stay quiet. My god. Oh my god oh my god, Ash help me! - Oh my god, Tessa. - Are you okay? You're gonna be alright, you're gonna be alright, come on. - Keep up. - Freeze. Guys, Ash, there's a building over here, come on. Faster, come on. - Over here. - Let's go. Lay her down here. I need something to stop the blood. Right, okay. You sure you know what you're doing? You don't grow up in a hospital without learning a few things. You need a doctor. No, they're gonna be stationed at the hospitals by now. Anyone that comes in with a wound like this is gonna be detained. So are you gonna be okay to keep going? What? She's not going anywhere. - You tell me. - Ash, if we can a car, we can get her to another hospital outside of town. No, no cars, we can't risk being seen. We can't drive. So what're we supposed to do? - You leave me here. - What? We're not leaving you here okay? I appreciate the concern Donny but your friends need you and I can take care of myself. We don't even know where Mark is right now. You're so concerned with your freaking cause - that you. - What was that? - Stay here. - Ash. I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Ash, look out. - Shooter. No no no no no, it's just a camera. - Drop it. - Alright. You're the guy from the mechanic shop right? - You're not with them? - No. We're not here to steal anything, you can have everything alright? You're not looters are you? - No. - Then who are you? No more questions. Please, she's been shot, we just need help. - Tessa Monroe. - Hey, be careful. - Do not move. - Do I know you? No ma'am but my name's Roland and that's my buddy Kurt and we're big fans. So do you two actually know what's going on over there? - Power down. - What? Listen if you need help, if you're dressing this wound, we're gonna need all hands all deck and if you want answers, we don't talk on tape so power down. So why else do you think they were buying up billions of rounds of amo? You just go do a little research for yourself and you'll find the ground work for this has been in place for years. In an instant these guys can take over communications, transportation, food. I mean, what's in it for them? Global totalitarianism. But you guys are like mechanics by day, - Rambo vigilantes by night? - We're patriots. Okay, we're humans, we're not sheep that just accept the way things are. If you guys are ready to wake up and join the resistance, good. But that's not what you want, is it? No they have our people, we just want 'em back. Then you all better record this. The organization for domestic aid and crisis control rode into town a few hours ago. With the help of what we believe to be the DHS. We think those were the fellas you met on the street. Wait the DHS is in on this? Yeah, they have a detention camp set up at the local school. That's where your people will be. Roland look, we don't know the first thing. We can't do this alone. Well lucky for you Kurt and I were prepping to do some recon on that camp and possibly set some of them innocents free. Okay this is going way too far. If what you're saying is true, we're talking about the Department of Homeland Security, alright? I want Mark and Becca's mom free just as much as everyone else and I wanna get the hell out of Madison but you're talking about taking on the actual U.S. army with a couple of wannabe badasses, three civilians, a wounded internet truther and a child. Hey. Yeah, I mean I played my fair share of Call of Duty and everything but you're talking about some real life serious stuff here okay? I am totally, totally not prepared for a war. No one's ever prepared for a war, but those who are victorious are the ones that rise up when all others falter. No wait, hold up nobody's saying anything about going to war, alright? We're not gonna be going in there, guns blazing like a bunch of commandos. Can you guys get us in there quietly? Sure, we can think of something. Guys, we're all out of options here. And you're running out of time. What does that even mean? Tomorrow morning the mainstream media will tell the country that a few terrorists were posing as demonstrators in Madison. Troops were ordered in early in the morning to detain the criminals and evacuate some civilians to a temporary safety camp at the county school. Unfortunately, there was a detonation at the camp and many lives were lost. Wait, there were no terrorists so why would they blow up the camp? Falsifying attacks are always a sure fire way to get the public on board with your cause. I'm sorry, you think the U.S. Military is gonna blow up that camp? I'm saying the danger is typically exaggerated to encourage submission. We live in a safer world now than we ever have but our perception is of a dangerous one and that's a perception that's manufactured by those who would like to relieve us of our rights. So why are they doing all this? Who knows, could be war profiteering, could be a political move or it could be just see how much they can get away with. Slowly ease the people into this new way of life. Nevertheless, it will surely cause more widespread marshall all the while demonizing those of us who believe in the Constitution. No, okay you don't know what's going on, okay? You are just a nobody. You're right, you're right we don't but the soldier Kurt and I talked to on the other hand well now he was pretty positive about it. So then how long do we have? 0500, then the bombs go off. I gotta get moving. - Come on. - Easy, easy You need to sit. Tessa, as much as Kurt and I would love to have you by our side, the little one's right. If you pop one of those stitches and start to bleed again you might not be so lucky next time. You can't stop me soldier. No ma'am I can't, but I can remind you of how important you are to this cause. Look, just bed down here for the night, alright? Take this here radio, call your friends in the morning and tell the story, that's what you're meant to do. - Becca should stay too. - No. No we need as many healthy hands as possible. Tessa, Roland's right okay? Just stay here we'll be fine alright? We can take care of ourselves. Besides, you and I still needa do that interview okay? So get some rest. You're gonna be a great journalist Donny. - Do me a favor. - Yeah, of course anything. - Run my camera. - Really? This is Tessa Monroe in Madison. Everyone remind yourselves that what you accomplish tonight will impact the world tomorrow. Help those who cannot help themselves. Free the minds of those who are lost to the chaos of misinformation and propaganda but always remember, if you forgo your freedoms for the promise of security, you will have neither. Okay, I'm gonna cut it there. Everyone just remember to send me your footage in a few days when this all calms down. The world needs to see this. You're a tough little girl, you know that? Thanks, you too. Hey, you really helped out back there. We're all really glad you're safe. We're gonna get you your mom okay? I know, I wouldn't be here if I thought you couldn't. Where'd you guys get all that sweet gear? We've had it, should always be prepared for an emergency. I mean, I've got a flashlight, extra battery or two, maybe half a tube of Neosporin somewhere but you know, when I left my house this morning, I just must've forgotten my assault rifle and bullet proof vest, I don't know. Yeah, well now you know for next time. Next time, there ain't gonna be a next time. My brother and I, our relationship is complicated and Stephanie has always been the one to try and bring us back together and uh, - Will she be okay? - I hope so. She's family, you know, and I'd do anything for family. What's going on? So what's the plan? I just feel a hoard of 'em's gonna be inside this school. A big and open area maybe a gymnasium. So how do we get in? Working on it. I saw this movie once where this crew, they snuck into a top secret government base by sending in someone as a decoy who pretended he was hurt. I mean chances are, if they already think you're injured, no one's gonna shoot you right? So anyways, all I'm saying is one of us could totally go up to the fence there with a limp or act like they're hurt and need a bandage. Wait, no no no no no no no no that was a bad idea. Don't listen to me, I don't really know what I'm saying. Wait, my camera. Hold my camera. - Oh, okay. - Okay, wish me luck. Alright, you two just hang back and find some cover. We'll take care of the guards and then we'll signal you when it's safe, okay? Okay. You don't know how good you have it. What? To have so many people who care about you. Becca you have family. I have a mom, when she's there. Your mom loves you, she would do anything for you. She would, that's my point. Even after giving all her energy to others, she will always be by my side when I need her. I would do the same for her 'cause that's what family really is. Are you sure you're only 10. Come on, Donny will kill me if he finds out you had his camera. - All clear. - I only see one of 'em. I can do this, I got this, no problem. Just take a deep breath alright? Okay, you're just acting like a wounded hiker. Yeah, just tell them that your buddy back here and he needs a medic okay? Nice, okay. But it is of vital importance that no matter what you do you turn around and you come right back here. What if they tell me to freeze? Well let's just hope your story about not shooting an injured man is true. I did say that I saw this on a movie right? Look, we're gonna be right here, okay? - We're right here. - Here it goes. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey I'm sorry dude. - Shut up. But my friend and I were hiking, - he's hurt real bad. - Freeze. Open the gate, move. Back there actually, not this way. - On your knees. - What do we do? Found a civilian in the South gate, how would you like me to proceed? Why aren't they helping him? - I don't know. - Copy. Roland, Kurt, Roland, Kurt? Really, oh my god. They need to get out of there. Should we do something? Dude you killed that guy. Where the hell were you? Look, unlike your Hollywood movies not all things go according to plan. Donny, you okay? Yeah man, I thought they were gonna shoot me. Well luckily that. And if it didn't? Look, we're here, okay, we're all in one piece let's focus on accomplishing our mission and getting out the same way. We gotta move now. Hide the body, go secure us some transportation. Signal the girls. Okay, let's go. - Good job, Steph. - Here, it's on. - Dude, look at this. - This is creepy. Come on, let's check this out. I don't know that that's a really good idea. Oh, come on man, how often do we get to spend together? Look at this place, doesn't it remind you of that cabin we used to stay with mom and dad? Oh, hey we're supposed to be hiking, not breaking in Yeah, we still will, let's check this out. Oh, here's the door. This is probably illegal. Oh, it's not illegal if it's open. All clear over here. I don't think this is the right time for a tune up Look we need to be quiet, okay? So I'm gonna use this, and you try not to use that. - Got it. - Stay put. - Aye, stop. - Sorry dude. Holy crap, dude I am so sorry, it's these stupid shoes. - Next time I say wait - You okay? - Yeah, we handled it. - Yeah I can see that. Ash, what the hell are you doing? Look I'm not a great shot but I can handle it if things get tough okay? Hey, what's all the commotion, Serg you there? - Serg you there? - Everything alright? Sending backup now. Alright, looks like we can expect some more company okay so stay tight, stay silent, stay calm, okay? - Hey you guys there. - Move! Come on. - So much for silence. - Move move. - Keep it up. - Where are we going? Straight up here to the left. Oh my god. - Everyone okay? - Yeah. Becca, how you doin'? Let's just hurry up and get out of here. Well, what do we do? Roland what do we do? Give me a minute. I don't think we have a minute. - Roland. - Move, get inside. My eyes are burning. Open up. We should be okay for now. - Mom, mom, mom! - Becca! Mark! Mark! Mom! Mom! Help Becca. Roland come on, we need you to open the cells. Use this to open the cages, do not let them out of your sight alright? Mark? Mark! Mom! I don't see her. Mom! Mom! Becca, Becca, what? What are you doing here? It's okay, we're gonna get you out of here. - We? - Oh that's Donny, he was with the group from earlier. I told you to get out of town, you can't trust that anybody is who they say they are. Mom, stop. It's okay, I'm fine. Really, we've been safe but we really need to get you out of here. You are so strong. You know that right? - And stubborn too. - I learn from the best. Alright, let me get this open. Mark! Mark! - Mark? - Ash? - Ash, what are you doing here? - Are you okay? Yeah, where the hell did you get a gun? - Mark, Mark! - Stephanie? What are you doing here? Look what they did to you. I'm alright, I'm okay. Look we're getting you out of here. We're getting everybody out of here. What? Obviously what they're doing is crazy illegal but you're breaking me out of jail, come on What are you thinking Ash? And you brought my fiance, you guys could've been killed. You could just shut up for a minute there's so many things happening right now, you can't even begin to know the answers to. Ash. Look, we've risked our lives getting here and you'll lose yours if you stay. - What do you mean? - We don't have time alright? - You just have to trust me. - Okay. - Who are you? - You're drooling. - Weren't you my mechanic? - One of my many skills. I don't know what's going on but I'm glad to see you guys. You too, no matter what you're my brother and I love you. Love you too little brother. Alright, how do we get out of here? My buddy Kurt is securing us some transportation out as we speak, til then we need to get the rest of these cages open and get the civilians ready for evacuation. - Let's do it. - Here we go, come on. Stay tight guys. Hey, why are you always filming with this thing? I'm making a movie. Give me that. Don't touch it, it's expensive, come on. Was the package acquired? Package acquired, awaiting pick up. Pick up in route, driving a big yellow Twinkie. Haven't been in one of these since I was knee high. Oh, and I parked Plan B outside the fence just in case. You boys didn't make it easy on me. Yeah, well we ran into a few more scuffles, not quite as covert as we expected, you okay? Yeah, just had to deal with a few more guards but I got it. Never heard no alarms though. Yeah well they don't wanna wake the whole town but don't worry they know we're here. Alright, pulling up now. Shit! Kurt! Kurt, do you copy? Kurt! Kurt! Yeah, but ya'll need to hurry. Just like I said before guys, keep your heads down, and go straight to the bus. Once everyone's loaded then we'll take off, alright? Stay close.

You're completely surrounded. I want you to lay down your weapons and rise up with your hands on your head. You won't get out of here uninjured if you don't comply. There's no escape. You are in very very serious trouble. We'd like this evening to end peacefully if possible. This is your last warning, you have five seconds to comply or we will use force. Five, four, three, two, one. Guns, guns, guns, guns. Keep going, keep going. Ash, the camera. Steph, Steph, you okay? Ash, go go go. Hang on!

Mark, Mark, we have to, Mark. No! Get off of me, get off of me! You're not going anywhere. Get off of me! Get, no we have rights! No, no! Mark, Mark, Mark, no! As promised, we have a very special guest in our studios with us right now, Marcus Whitmore. Mark, how you doing? Understandably, Mark is a bit shook up as we all are having seen this footage for the very first time but Mark, his brother Ash, and his good friend Donald Donovan, they've all been on an emotional rollercoaster these past few weeks from being in indicted for conspiracy to start a riot, escalating police tensions, planting a bomb at the ODACC Camp. Then a week later, being exonerated from all those crimes when news of our footage broke. So Mark, I mean we're not looking for a thank you has helped you and your family in this situation. - Exonerated. - Wait, wait, wait hold that thought, I just wanna say I am glad that we were able to stop these monsters from ruining these kids lives anymore than they already have. Now, they can go home and properly grieve their loss which I'd just like to say that me and my staff here our sincerest condolences to you and to Stephanie Grahm's family for their loss. This travesty didn't have to happen. She was an amazing woman and her memory will live on. Mark, can you tell the viewers what it was like to hold Stephanie when she took her last breath? Did she say anything to you? - Are you joking? - Excuse me? This is why you brought me on here? To exploit my fiance's death? For viewers? I don't think you understand what we do here Mark. No, I get it. Okay? You know, the only reason I came here was to tell our side of the story, the real truth. Not your edited conspiracy version of it. Myself and my field reporter Tessa Monroe. - Oh don't even. - We run. Don't even start with your brave reporter. Alright, if it wasn't for Tessa and you and this god awful site, none of this would've happened. You got our town all riled up and convinced two gun totting fanatics to lead my family into the middle of a blood bath. She and you are the terrorists. Mark, I know you're in a lot of pain but even you have to admit that this, this operation was a false fly, manufactured by the MGI, The Major Globalists Institutions. Mark, please. All of you, sitting at home in your comfy little chairs pretending like none of this is real, you should all be ashamed of yourselves. Because of people like you that humor this idiot a lot of good people are dead or in prison. Mark, where's he going? Go get him back here. Just, go! Alright, alright, you can cut the feed now. Cut it. Alright viewers, welcome back to the Donny D Show. We have a very special episode today, this is not a normal video, instead, this is a reaction video. I just finished watching my good friend I didn't wanna do a reaction videos but we just hit three million subscribers, thank you all for that and as you know everything I do is for you, you know, the shirt off my back, the belt around my waist, the cat that's running around my apartment. I don't know why you would need my cat and in fact your not getting my cat. But, the thing with reaction videos is I think they're pointless, they're stupid, and they're a waste of time and there are a lot of other things in life that are pointless, stupid, and a waste of time that you could waste your time on. For instance, unboxing videos. If you don't know what an unboxing video is, number one you're missing out, two, it is exactly what it sounds like. You watch a video wherein someone unboxes a box that they bought presumably from a box store. Sometimes, the box was shipped to them from an online distributor so they're opening a box inside of another box and sometimes those boxes have boxes in them as well. Now, I'm not gonna keep going on about unboxing videos because if you're watching my channel, you know what an unboxing video is. What're we talking about? Oh, right. The whole point of what I'm doing. We started talking about the fact that this video was going to be a reaction video and I haven't actually given you my thoughts on it. I think the whole thing was a terrible display of journalism which is really the state of America right now. Again, I'm topical and informative, put that down. So it's difficult to watch that Mark obviously, you know, hasn't spent the kind of time in front of the camera and in the media that I have so he wasn't really prepared for those kinds of things to happen and how to deal with that. I haven't heard from Mark in a little while. I've reached out to him a little bit, I'm sure he's busy and obviously he's dealing with a lot of things as thousands of people that were from Madison and were there during the whole incident are. Well hopefully he gets back to me. I would make a plead for him right on here to get back to me but he does not watch my channel. He told me so, it's not a big deal. It kind of is, I wanted feedback from him. Just give me something. I don't like this take. Can we do it again 'cause I don't really know what I'm talking about now. I mean they totally railroaded Mark with all those questions and to bring up all that stuff about Stephanie. God it's hard to say that name. We're not gonna use that part, hold on. Where was I? So Tessa, obviously she used the footage The FringeFacts, they used the footage to look the way that they wanted it to I still haven't receive my own footage from my camera that was taken, they said they would be getting back to me. I don't know where it is. They've been impossible to get in touch with. I mean, you cannot get in touch with anyone. The government's impossible to talk with, obviously as we knew they would. The lawyers, are even hard to talk with. You would think the lawyers would want to get in touch with us. Maybe that's them. No, it is not. Tessa, okay. Footage, is this the footage? That would be amazing if I'm actually talking about something and then it happened. This is not the footage. What is this? What is this? Are you getting this? Like it's not grainy on the screen, do you need me to move the screen at all? Yeah, yeah, yes sir we have them in our custody as we speak. Tessa, Tessa Monroe is nuts. I'll send her my footage 'cause I think that it'll help distract from tonight's events. I mean, the rest of them believed all the crazy conspiracies I mean, they were doubtful at first but it didn't take much to persuade 'em. Yes sir. Yeah, with his family in our custody, I don't think we'll have a problem getting John to talk. Yes sir. Yes sir, we'll wait for your call. Roland, what? What, no, Becca, Becca, no! - Let go of me, let go of me. - Move it, move it - move it, pipe down. - No, Becca! - Let's go, let's go. - No, no! - Quiet down, come on. - No, no! - Enough. - Becca, Becca, No, let me down! Becca! Do you know who your dad really is? Okay, uh we're putting that up online. I gotta call Ash, I should call Ash. You can cut, I just called my mom by mistake.
