(PA announcer mumbling) - Oh, they're going to substitute right now? They need him in the game. I'm sorry, Drew. - What's all that noise? - I'm at the Palace watching the Pistons kick their butt. You wanna make it quick? - All right, check it. I'm coming home for pops's retirement party, and I'd like you to come with me. - Oh, I can't do that. - What do you mean you can't do that? - Well because I had already made plans, and I have a date. Who made that? - You're bringing a date to my father's retirement party? - Yeah. - How you going to play me? That's cool, Cece. That's cool in the game. - Drew, they broke up. Oh, I'm missing the game! Okay, I'll call you back. - I ain't mad at you. - Million dollar contract. - I'll holler at you. - Bye, Drew. - No commitments. - No commitments. (laughing) - I'm telling you buddy they all do. That's why I just prefer to pay. Yo, what about that chicken I turned you on to, the singer? - Tatiana Michaels, nah. - Yeah, look your family will love her. She's talented, sophisticated, and fine. Plus if you take Tatiana with you, you'll find out that CeCe's about it. - How's that? - Look a man is never more attractive than when he has a fine little chicken on his arm. - Man, I don't want to play them games. - Think of the possibilities, Drew. Take Tatiana with you, have her do a few songs at the party, parade around in a nice dress, and you'll have this CeCe chicken right back where you want her. - Where do I want her? - Always available. (knocking) - [Tatiana] Who is it? - It's Drew. - [Tatiana] Andrew? - Expecting somebody else? - [Tatiana] Well I was hoping for Brian McKnight. - Yeah well people in hell hope for ice water. - [Tatiana] It's open, silly. Make yourself comfortable. I'll be out in a minute. - [Self-Help Narrator] I'm alluring, attractive, beautiful, confident, charismatic, charming, and cool. All men desire to be with me. All women aspire to be me. - [Tatiana] Have a seat in the living room - [Self-Help Narrator] Success and financial rewards of all kinds flow to me from all directions continuously. I have the uncanny ability to see people for who they are. And immediately upon meeting them find the perfect words to charm them and confirm their first impression that I'm as charming as I am beautiful. - Andrew darling, so lovely to see you. (funky music) You didn't tell me John was playing here. - You didn't ask. - He looks, I mean he sounds wonderful. - Tatiana, I need to talk to you about something. I gotta go back to Detroit. What are you looking for? - A waiter. How long have we been here? - We just sat down. - Service here sucks. - Hello my name is Matthew, I'll be your server this evening. Would you like to hear the specials? - I would have liked to have heard them five minutes ago. - Great, then I'll be right back to take your order. (man laughing) - God damn it. Check it, it's Brown Sugar Bear. - [Brown Sugar Bear] When they got a big ol' ass. - He had a notorious rukus. You know that white rapper with the dreds? - Pale face? - I heard he dangled the dude by his ankles out the window of a New York hotel room just to make him sign a new contract. - How barbaric. Anyway, what are you talking about? - [Drew] My father's retiring-- - Traction. - They are so ignorant. - Just ignore 'em. - Big ol' little thumb is crazy around here. - They must be from the projects. - My father's retiring, and he's having this-- - Is that cigar smoke? How rude! - Chill, baby. - It's not just rude. It's illegal. In case you didn't know, in Los Angeles smoking is illegal in restaurants. - On no, she didn't. (laughing) - Look here baby, I don't inhale. (laughing) - Oh no, this will never do. - [Drew] What are you gonna do? Tatiana. - What you need, baby? - I need you, your cigar, and your loud ass friends over there. - We's about to get beat down. - For what? - For about an hour. (laughing) - Come on. Let's give the lady some room. (funky music) - [Brown Sugar Bear's Girlfriend] Whatever. - You are incredible. - Talk to me, Andrew. - My father's having a retirement party next month in Detroit, and I need a date for a few days. - What are you saying? - I want you to come home with me. - Oh, well you have to buy me dinner first. (laughing) A few days, huh? - It'll be fun. I'll buy you a new gown. - When do we leave? - Hello. Hello, welcome. Hey. Hello, welcome. - Here we are 37 D and E. I'll take the aisle. - Coach, huh? Well I guess this will have to do. Andrew, I'll be right back. - I'm just gonna sit here and work on my toast for the party. - [Flight attendant] Good evening and welcome aboard Northern Airlines flight 333 to Detroit's Metropolitan Airport. Please remember that all carryon items must be stored in the overhead bin. - What the hell? - [Flight Attendant] And exercise caution when opening the overhead as items may shift during flight. - What are you doing? - I'm securing my instrument in the seats, isn't it obvious? - Yeah, but you can't do that. These seats might belong to somebody. - I'm sorry, I can't put it in the overhead. It might get damaged. - Excuse me, buddy. Can I get by? - Sure, sorry. - [Man In Trench Coat] Geez, Louise. - Tatiana, these seats might belong to somebody. You can't leave your instrument here. - Watch me. - Hey, watch it lady. - Sorry, but I'm not going to be sitting next to a screaming baby for the next three hours. (speaking in a foreign language) my brother. (speaking in a foreign language), bitch. (baby gurgling) - Tatiana, we don't own the plane. - Excuse me sir, is that your instrument in row 40? - No, it's mine. - Well miss, you're going to have to move it. You'll either have to put it into the overhead or store it under the seat in front of you. - Sorry, no can do. - Miss, you don't have a choice. It's a federal regulation. - Well show me where it says in the FAA rule book that a passenger cannot strap a musical instrument in someone else's seat. Go ahead, show me now. - Either you move it, or I'll have you escorted off the plane. - Drew, Drew! - Hey Angie. - Look at you. Hey sweetie. You look great. Wonderful. Who's this young lady my little brother has chosen to bring home? - All right. Tatiana Michaels, I want you to meet my big sister-- - Angela Williamson Charles, it is an honor to meet you. - Oh it is? Why is that? - Why you helped take care of my Andrew. - Oh, my Andrew. - You helped clean his runny nose. You helped him with his homework. You are so wonderful. I cannot believe that bastard cheated on you. (crackling explosion) (funky music) Domestic car, what a concept. (funky music) - Drew, it is going to be off of the hook. We have got one of the best caterers in town, a jazz trio, and a video crew. - A video crew? You mean this is gonna be video tapped? - Yes girl. - No, I can't be video tapped. - Why not? - Because after I become a star, they might sell the tape to Hard Copy. (funky music) I'm thinking about changing my stage name. - Why? Tatiana Michaels is a lovely name. - I want to call myself Nudity. ♪ There is a side of town to Detroit ♪ ♪ Houston, take a bow ♪ - Okay well, nudity does have a definite ring to it. - Yeah, I thought so too. I don't want there to be any barriers between my audience and I. - My audience and me. - It's between my audience and I. - Actually it's between my audience and me 'cause me is the object of the preposition between. - Anyway, before I was interrupted, I was saying that clothing can be such a wall between people. - I feel you, baby. Especially between those who choose some and those who don't choose any. - Oh, you understand, Angela. We're gonna get along famously. - Yeah, as long as you keep your clothes on, baby. (funky music) Tatiana, can you help get your bags? - Andrew, would you be a dear? That was the worst flight I have ever been on in my life. Rude, rude, rude, rude. - Honey, I'm home. - [Tatiana] I'll never fly that airline again. - [Kids] Uncle Drew. - Hey y'all. Hey Thomas, look at you, man. Necy, how you doing sweetheart? - Fine. I got a five of five in citizenship. - Really? - I rode the rollercoaster at Cedar Point. - That's 'cause you're getting big, boy. Thomas, Necy, this is my friend Tatiana. - Hello Thomas. Hi, Necy. - CeCe's prettier than her. - What'd you say, child? - Don't pay her no mind, Tatiana. Girl, what did I tell you about calling other people. - What's up, big bra. - All right, all right. Yes, I'm his big bra. So he grew up that way, and I kinda (grunting). - I see you met my girl? - Oh yeah, we done already met. She over here flirting and carrying on. - Oh yeah. - Your brother has a very sharp wit. It's very attractive. - Hey you know it's like Three Musketeers bar, fluffy not stuffy. - Well just remember, she's with me, all right? - I already told her I'm married. You ain't got nothing to worry about. Just had to let her know so that Carol wouldn't get upset. - I ain't stopping you, E.J. - Oh if she endured that nasty bankruptcy with you, I'm sure she can stand a little of my flirtation. - Excuse me. - Hey pops. (laughing) Tatiana this is my pops, Earnest Williams. - You can call me Ernie. - Ernie, well I can see where Drew got his good looks. - Watch out now, I'm married. Verlene! Come here and meet Drew's little friend. - [Verlene] Drew. - [Ernie] There you go. - Hello, how are you? - Are you all looking forward to the party? - Oh I can't stand all this whole fuss. - Don't believe that. He's loving it. - But I have to admit it is kinda nice everybody going out of their way n'all. But enough about me. They tell me you're going to do a couple of songs for us. - Well not for us, for you. Do you have a favorite one? - Well I always kinda like that song Summertime. - Really? Do you like white bread too? - White bread is your friend, girl. - [Carol] Come on y'all. Breakfast is ready. - Let's eat. - Ah Verlene? - Yes. - May I see the kitchen first? - Of course. Okay, you gonna sit there? - Where is Drew gonna sit, right here? Girl? - I need to see the kitchen. - [Angela] Sure is a bitch. - That child is special. - Did you hear that? She said she wants to see the kitchen. - Burnt up some pancakes. (laughing) - Why don't you take that seat? - She can sit in the kitchen. - Heavenly father, we come before you this morning to give thanks for all of your bountiful blessings. We thank you for the gift of family. We thank you for the gift of good health. We thank you for the love we share, one for another. We ask that you bless this food. That it be nourishment for our bodies as your word is nourishment for our spirit. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. - Amen. - It's good. (slurping) (plate clattering) - You see what I'm saying? - I see what you're saying. You two are never prepared for this-- - No, this street has been funky. It doesn't matter. (bell ringing) - Who's that? - Whether it's winter, snow, anything. - Here's Johnson. - What's up, black man? - Hey buddy. - [Drew] What are you doing here? - Yeah, I'm gigging over at the Holiday Inn over in Toledo. They just called me about it. How dope is that? - [Drew] Time and place, kid. - Yeah. [Drew] Look like you cleaned yourself up a little bit too. - Yeah, well you know how I likes to keep the ladies guessing, you know? Yeah man, one of the cats I'm working with lives in Detroit, so I caught a ride up with him. He'll be back tonight. - [Drew] How'd you find the crib? - Yvonne gave me all the four, uno, uno. - Yeah, just what I pay her for. - Yeah, you know. - Angie, mama, y'all remember John. - How you doing? - It's good to see you. - Hey Mrs. Williamson, how you doing? Good to see you. Thanks. (guitar music) (screeching) - John! - Tatiana Michaels, what's up, girl? - How are you? - Good baby. So you let Drew talk you into coming, huh? - Yeah, he needed me. - Let's not get carried away. You want something to eat, man? - When have you ever known me not to? Shoot. - Want some leftovers? - I want you to mind your business. - I am. - You keep your face right here. I'm talking to you. - You want some tea? - No, you go ahead though. - You sure? (dramatic music) That's CeCe. - Who's she? - Oh, she's a girl that grew up down the street. She and Drew have been friends ever since they were kids. - It's funny. Drew never mentioned her. - Guess the feeling's mutual. Recently I've seen her around town with this big, old, tall, fine, dark, handsome brother. Not as handsome as my baby brother, but he was fine. Like a cup of tea? - No. - I think I'll go get me some. (dramatic music) - This think ain't working, man. - What you mean? - I'm starting to think bringing Tatiana was a bad idea. - Explain Lucy. - She's crazy. - Crazy? - Tick, tick, boom, kid. - Yeah, but she's fine. - Yeah, she's fine, but that ain't everything. - Oh come one, man, you tripping. Now if she was bugged, you'd know it. Y'all have been kicking it, what, about a year? - We've been kicking it in Los Angeles. LA is different from other places. Hell, people trip there, and they're rewarded for it. But here people are real, and that Hollywood shit just doesn't play. - But what you gonna do? She here now. - I'm stuck with her. - Oh come on, Drew. It's all to the good. Tatiana will cool out. Plus you still got to support her to the party. Now remember baby girl's gonna be up in there flossing with that guy from the Pistons. And if you step in there by yourself, you gonna get played kid. - You right, dog. - I know I'm right. - I'll be damned if I'm gonna let Cece front me. Hey tomorrow, we're going to church, and when I step in there with Tatiana, CeCe's going to freak out. - See, stick to the plan. Tatiana's cool. - You know. All aboard the night train. - [John] Oh yeah man, I'll be right there. - Who that? - That's Hassan. He's playing this Toledo gig with me. He's cool. He talks too much. - Hey man, try and make the party, all right? - All right, but I'm going to have to bring Hassan with me. You know what they want to rent a car? Peace and happiness.

Cece, come on rehearsal's about to start. - Okay, here I come. I know I don't have to explain to you, but we go back a long way, and I want you to understand I'm at a point in my life where I need more than a friend who comes into town and wants to kick it for a few days and is gone again. - Isn't that what most pro basketball players do? My bad. I'm sorry. I'm all up in your Kool-Aid, and I don't even know the flavor. - Well people talk entirely too much around here. - Girl, you know you can't keep any secrets around Triumphant Baptist Church. - You know that's right. - CeCe, come on. - Okay, one sec. I'm coming. So how long you going to be here? - I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. - Same old Drew. What is it you keep rushing back to? - Work I guess. - Well, it was good seeing you again. - You too. I better get going. They're probably all waiting for me at the car. - Yeah. Goodbye. (choir music) - CeCe, what are you doing tonight? - Why? - I want to see you. - Did you hear a word I just said? - I heard every word you said. - I don't know, Drew. - [Drew] CeCe, please. ♪ For old times sake ♪ - Don't be trying to get that tired old mac on with me. - Please. Pretty please. - [CeCe] No, Drew. - With brown sugar on top. - No, I'm not-- Hey CeCe, come on ♪ I'm in my right mind ♪ - What's up? - Trappers Alley about six. Work on your begging. ♪ I serve O mighty God ♪ ♪ Lord O mighty God, we serve ♪ ♪ Angles bow down ♪ - Tatiana. ♪ Angles bow before him ♪ ♪ Heaven and earth adore him ♪ ♪ Lord almighty God we serve ♪ ♪ Mighty God we serve ♪ - [Ernie] Ready for some of that baked juniper, Verlene. - If he merry. - Tell your boys, did you see him looking at me? He was looking at me, boy. - Andrew, I need to talk to you. - Okay. - I need to talk to you alone. - Y'all excuse us. - She's is too many things. He need to grab her by force and drag her downstairs. - What's this about? - This. - What's that? - It's the program for the party. - Yeah so. - Andrew, there're 10 speakers tomorrow night, right? - Yeah, so? - And each one is in order of importance, right? - Right. - Well look. I'm second, second. - And your point is what? - I cannot be second. That won't work. - What won't it work? - My song, it would be anticlimactic for me to sing the song that I've chosen in that position. It just won't work, Andrew. - Huh? - Andrew, the song that I have selected will prove to be the dramatic apex of the entire night. As the evening progresses, the anticipation in the room will reach a fever pitch. Then I will step before the audience and serve as the vessel for their emotional release. My song will allow the night to crescendo. - What planet are you from? - Andrew, don't be mean. - Okay Tatiana, where do you think you should be on the program? - Eighth. - Eighth, my father's 10th. - And your point is? - You expect me to tell my family that my girlfriend-- - I'm not your girlfriend. - That my friend who they just met by the way has to go on eighth so that she may be the dramatic apex and the emotional release before the crescendo? Are you out of your fucking mind? - It can't be either way. - Oh yes it can. You can go on second like it says in the program. - Okay, well you forced my hand. - [Drew] What are you talking about? - If I can't be in the eighth position, I'll just have to sing another song. - What other song? The one you've chosen is perfect. - When the lights drop and my spot comes up, I will sing YMCA. - Come on. - Eighth, or I will do it. I swear to Buddha, I will. - This is insane. This is crazy. I'm going out for awhile, and I'm going to give you a chance to think about what it is you're asking. - It cannot be any other way, Andrew. (sighing) (samba music) (phone ringing) (samba music) - Make it good. - John, it's Tatiana. Did I wake you? - No, no. No, it's all right, darling. I had to get up to answer the phone anyway. What's up? - Andrew and I got into a fight. - [John] About what? - I don't want to talk about it. I'm too upset. I just wanted to talk to someone. - All ears. Well, maybe not all ears. - You know I really like him, but he just doesn't seem to understand me. - What do you mean? - You know like when you're performing and it's time for your solo? - [Johnson] Yeah. - You know exactly when to start, how long to play and when to finish. - Yeah. - How do you know that? - You just know. - Exactly. You know me so well. - I do? - You've been a big help. Thanks, John. - I have? (samba music) - Guess who? - Judging by the sweaty palms, it must be Marion Berry. - You're quick. - Hey, I wasn't even ready. - I know that's why I took it. People are so much more interesting when they're not posing. - I remember posing for you once, but you talked me into posing topless. - You remember that, huh? - Oh God, and my mother almost killed me when she found those pictures. - Now those pictures were artistic. - My mother was not trying to hear artistic, okay? - So what are you up to these days? - I'm with US Customs. I do inspections out of metro. - What's that like strip searches? - If I have to. Wow, look at this, Drew? - [Drew] You like that? - Yeah, it's beautiful, don't you think? - Yeah, it's gorgeous. I'm just surprised that you like it that's all. - Why is that? - Well, it's just kind of... - Kind of what? - Sensuous. - And it surprises you that I like something that's sensuous? - Yeah, it does. - Why is that? - You've always been a little uptight about sex. - I am not uptight. - CeCe, you are so uptight. - Oh why? 'Cause I never called you big papa? - You've called big papa. You've just used other words, sounds. - Sounds, oh really? - Really, see the problem is that you've never been able to appreciate the humor in sex. - There's humor in sex? - There's mad humor in sex. - How so? - Because people are funny looking. Men get bald heads, women get cellulite. - So? - So you have these two funny looking people hooking their bodies together in these bizarre positions bumping and grinding, and that's funny. - Okay, you're a very sick man. - See that's what I mean, just what I mean. - Just because I don't happen to find making love funny does not make me some kind of a prude. - Think about it, CeCe. You got feet, the sweat, you've got grunting. - Oh that's right, you do grunt. - Oh I don't grunt. - Oh you grunt, and you grunt loud. It's all starting to come back to me, sir grunt-a-lot. - No, no, no, no, no, no not me. I don't grunt. - Lord have mercy, Jesus mama. - [Tatiana] Angela. - Oh hey. - [Tatiana] I thought I heard you in here. - Girl, I always like to make me a little something on Sunday for the week. - Yeah, that smothered chicken was delicious. - Oh yeah, mama gets that one, oh yeah. - Um Angela, could I talk to you for a minute? - Sure, what can I do for ya? Excuse me. - Well I was looking at the program for the play. - Isn't it nice? I just love that black and gold embossed lettering. It's so strong and masculine like my daddy. - Yes, black and gold was an excellent choice. - Oh. This isn't about the program, is it? - Well, yes and no. It's not exactly about the program. It's about the people on the program. - [Angela] It doesn't meet with your approval? Excuse me. - Well I wouldn't characterize it in that way? - How would you characterize it? - I'm just not pleased. - Soda? - No. - Oh, that's too bad. That you're not pleased. What's the problem? - Well you see I was looking at the lineup of speakers and guests. And I couldn't help but notice that I'm second. - Well everyone is in order of importance, Tatiana. - Excuse me? - Everyone is in order of importance, Tatiana. - Well you see, Angela, I think that's the problem that I'm having. The song that I have chosen it just doesn't work if it's in second. - Excuse me. - Um, I don't quite understand what the problem is. You're already doing a song during the cocktail hour and the other one during the program itself. What's the problem? - It's very complicated, Angela. - Perhaps you can explain it to me in a way that my feeble mind can comprehend it? - Let's not be condescending-- - Let's not forget that you and I just met, and you're trying to tell me how to coordinate my father's retirement party. - I'm not trying to tell you anything. I'm merely suggesting that I be number eighth right before your mother, and there we could achieve maximum results. - Tatiana, everybody's asleep. Drop your shorts. - What? - Come on, girl, drop your shorts. - What? - See I've heard about women like you on Jerry Springer, but I've never seen one like you know in real life. I want to see it because I'm sure that it is long and hard. - How dare you? - Two things you should know. Number one, I'm getting read to take my mama's smothered chicken and go home. Number two, don't cross me little girl. (guitar music) - This is nice. - Yes, this is very nice. - How did we get here? - The Lodge Express way. - No, you know what I mean. I mean how did we end up like this? - Well you know it didn't have to be this way. - I know I asked you to move to California with me. Why didn't you? - I was 19. I was in school. Mostly I was scared. - Scared of what? - We were so young and California seems so far away. - I would've taken care of you CeCe. - But you didn't want to marry me. And I was not moving to LA with some man who just wanted to be my boyfriend. - I wanted more than that. - You wanted to play house. - CeCe Hogan doesn't play house. - I was too young to make that kind of commitment. - Oh please, men of that age make that type of commitment everyday. - I said I was too young. Besides, it's history now. - So where are you now? - You are the tightest kick in the ass. - See that's your problem, every time it gets real, you're not available. - You know what, this is getting way too deep. I just wanted to kick it a little bit. - Kick it a little bit? I'm not here for your amusement. Who do you think I am? - That's what I'm trying to figure out. - Okay, well why don't I just go, and I will see you at the party? - CeCe, don't go. I want to see you again. - Drew, what is the point? - The point is that you've lived in Detroit your entire life, and you've never even been to the Motown Museum. (guitar music) I thought I saw a bunch of lights on. Angie, E.J. what are y'all doing here at this hour? - That's what I want to know. - Okay baby sister, Drew is here now. What's this all about? - It is about that heifer Drew brought home. - [Drew] Excuse me? - She is too many things. - She is a little strange. I think her heart's in the right place. - Uh-uh mama, Dianna Ross left Detroit years ago, but the bitch is back. She upstairs lighting candles. - Angela, why don't you just say what you got to say, so I can get home? Carol gonna be worried. - Yeah, and we got to go to bed too. - [Drew] What did she do? - Tatiana, Miss Tatiana Michaels came to inform me that she is not pleased with going second in the program, that her number does not work in that particular spot, and that she thinks that she needs to move down in the program in order to achieve maximum results. - No, she didn't! - Oh did she, yes. And then I asked her well where do you think your song belongs? - [E.J.] What'd she say? - Oh she didn't even bat an eyelash. She looked at me and said I think right before your mother speaks. (laughing) - I like that baby. I know she got some great big ones. - That's what I said. - Well what'd you tell her? - I started to tell her she could sing her song on the God damned plane. Excuse me, mama. I started to tell her she could sing on the plane back to LA. And then I gave it some thought, and then I got mad, and then I got pissed that Drew's girlfriend-- - [Drew] She's not my girlfriend. - Whatever she is here. Whatever she is, you know hear me? Whatever she is, I don't have time to validate that heifer's ego. And I wanted to talk to y'all before I made any decisions. - Look Angela, you ain't asked me nothing about this whole thing that you've been planning, and why start now? - Ernest junior, don't even come bringing that because every time I came to you about something, you were too busy with this or being busy with that. - You're trying to make it seem like I don't care. - I'm not trying to make it seem-- - That's not fair. - That's not what I'm trying to do. - Hey, I've got a lot of responsibilities. I am still married! - Oh, you gonna go there. - Well, you went there first. - Oh so we gonna, ne-ne-ne, you go first. (Angela and E.J. talking at once) - Everybody just calm down. I said calm down! - Sorry daddy. - Sorry daddy. Mamma. - Mamma. - I think that's a great idea, pop. I'm gonna go home. - Good. - And I'm gonna calm down. - Good. - 'Cause if I stay up in here, somebody gonna get the backhand. - If you stay up in here, nothing is gonna happen here with your pajama wearing ass. - [Ernie] All right, Paddington. - Drew, let me tell you something, okay? I have been planning my, I have been planning our daddy's retirement party for months. And I'm not about to let that heifer that you brought up in here come in here in the 11th hour and tell me how to run things. You understand? I'm not having it. Mama, I am not having it. I'll see y'all tomorrow. - E.J. E.J. - Angie, can we save this for another day? - No, we cannot. What was that back there? That whole little thing, that whole little remark? Did you want to hurt me? Is that what you wanted to do? - No, that's not what I wanted but look I care for mom and dad too. - Well you need to act like it sometimes. - I do my best! - Maybe sometimes our best just isn't good enough. - Look I got my own family to look after. - Oh, here we go with the family thing again. - E.J. I'm telling you, you need a new act. - Angie, you can't make me feel guilty because I got my own family. - Guilty? Guilty? Guilty, are you crazy? Make you feel guilty? Mama and daddy are all I have got. - Girl, you got a masters degree. - And? - And a big house in Bloomfield Hills. - And a cat. I am alone. - You know I'm sick and tired of hearing you belly ache about what you ain't got. You're a big executive up there at the phone company. You get all the perks that come with that. I punch a clock everyday, everyday! I manage a loading dock. Let's talk about what I ain't got! - Let's talk about what you do got. You have got a wife that loves you very much. - And? - And children. And a very nice home. - Wanna trade? - No, no, I think I'll just stick with the perks of having a cat. Good night, Ernest. - Pop, I didn't mean to bring Tatiana here and cause all this drama. - It ain't all her fault. Hell, you know Angela and E.J. have never gotten along so good. - Bringing her was a huge mistake. - Ain't no mistakes in life, son. She's just one of those people that knows what she wants. Truth is I never should've made you feel as though you had to bring somebody with you. How you want to live your life is your business. I just know how much happiness my family has given me. - I just seem to do better by myself. I mean I either end up hurting somebody, or they end up hurting me. - So you're quitting? I don't recall raising any quitters. - I haven't quit, pop. I've just chosen not to get involved. Hell, look at E.J. Carol gives him more stress than a little bit. Angela's divorced. It just seems to be more trouble than it's worth. - What about Tatiana? - What about her? - You think she came all this way just because she want to sing at my party? - I haven't really thought about it. - Well you better start thinking about it. You brought her here for a reason. You need to stand by her. You skipped off tonight to go do Lord knows what, and you left her here all by herself. - We had some words. I needed some space. - Stop thinking about yourself all the damn time. (dramatic music) Go on and talk to the girl. I'm going to bed. (dramatic music) - Andrew, is that you? - No, it's Brian McKnight. - I thought you were upset with me. - No, I ain't mad at you. But Tatiana, why do you push so hard? - You wouldn't understand. - I understand that when we're alone it's dope. It's when other people get involved is when you start to trip. - Is Angela still upset? - Yeah, she's through. - Andrew, I don't mean to hurt people. But I'm special. I know how that sounds, but I am. - I know. I saw you make Brown Sugar Bear get up and move. - Who? - Never mind. Tatiana, somebody said to me that when it gets real, I'm no longer available. But I'm available for you right here, right now. - I don't usually talk to people about my problems. - Well I think you need to talk to me because we're here together, and your problems are now my problems. - You know I'm an only child, right? - Yeah. - Well I never learned to share. I never had to. I had everything. Everything. We had a big house. I mean I had more dolls than Toys 'R Us. I was always the best dressed girl in school. And I even got a new Mercedes when I turned 16. - I thought we were talking about problems. - Wait, there's more. I was pretty. - Indeed. - Father doted on me, and mother became jealous of our relationship, and it drove a wedge between us. Father began to pull away, and I was left all alone. - Well Tatiana, if you're alone now, it's because you push everybody away. - But it's always been hard for me to make friends. I mean women think I'm a bitch, and men only seem to want to use me. - That's not true. - It is true. Everybody just wants to take from me. - What is it you think everybody wants? - You know what I don't think I want to talk anymore. I want you to leave. - Huh? - Leave me alone, Andrew. Get out! - No, I'm not leaving until you make me understand. - Andrew, get out! - No, make me understand! - Andrew, I was raped. It was this drummer I had done a couple of gigs with. I went out with him one night, and the bastard beat me up and raped me. - Son of a bitch. - Yeah. Well I won't ever let anything like that happen to me again. I have to be in control. - Then he wins. - No, I win by controlling the world around me. - Nobody controls the world around them. - I can try. - You can't allow that to become your defining moment. - It doesn't define me. It's made me stronger. - You think walking through life kicking ass and taking names makes you stronger. - You think going through life unable to have a relationship with anything but a God damn camera is freedom? - Hey, this ain't about me? - I thought your problems were my problems or something like that? - No, it's about you and why it always has to be your way. - Why do you always get to set the boundaries? - You know what I'm done with this. - Wait a minute, I thought you were available. - I'm outta here. - Yeah, you know I know I have my problems, but you have a lot to work on too. Oh, and one more thing. I still must be eighth. - [Man Off Camera] Cut. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - No, is that how you answer the phone? - Angie, I'm sorry. But you woke me up. What time is it? - It's almost 11. Time for you to get your butt out of bed. - [Drew] Why? - Because you have to go take Nudity, miss thing to rehearse with the band. - And you're calling to remind me? - I certainly am, not by choice. - Angie, there's more going on with her than I realized. - Yeah well, I realized something going on with her. She can't ask everybody for everything she wants. - Well, she's still asking. Have you made up your mind yet? - And I won't until tonight. But I know one thing. That girl better be able to sing. - She can sing, trust me. Man, I'll be glad when this whole thing is over, and I can just go home and get back to work. - Listen Drew, let me tell you something. The career fast track is not what it's all about. - This coming from the fastest rising executive at Michigan Bell. - That would be me. I have bought into all that career bullshit, and what has it gotten me? - A six figure salary. - Yeah, but I've completely priced myself out of the pool of available brothers, and that's lonely, and it's no fun. They're intimidated by me. - Angie, there's a Mandingo warrior out there with your name engraved on his spear. - Oh, and I hope that's a long spear too. You know I speak Mandingo. Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby! (laughing) - Tonight's the big night, huh? - It most certainly is. You got your little toast together? - Oh yeah, most definitely. - Well I'm not together yet. I've got to go get my nails did and run a little more color through my hair. I think I'm gonna go Mandingo blonde, what you think? - Girl, you are crazy. - Like a fox, but I love ya. - I love you too. - Crazy boy.

I was just telling the rest of the group about back in the day when I was at Motown. - (speaking in a foreign language) - Excuse me. - Yes. - You worked here? - Well now, I don't want to make this tour all about me, but I was a singer. - (speaking in a foreign language) - Were you in a group, or were you a solo artist? - Oh I was in a group called the Mamazelles. - (speaking in a foreign language) - I don't remember the Mamazelles. - You don't remember the Mamazelles? - No mam. - Then honey you don't remember March of 1964. Our song Mr. Bus Driver Please Wait for Me went all the way to number 36. - (speaking in a foreign language) - I thought I knew all the big Motown acts, Tempts, The Supremes-- - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. - Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. - What you want to bring her up for? - Who? - Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, why'd you wanna bring her up? - We were just talking about what we remember as far as groups. - I heard you. You said Martha Reeves, and wasn't nobody talking about her. - Mam, but we were just talking about, you know the tour, and music, and how wonderful-- - Martha Reeves, Martha Reeves, oh that's all I used to hear about was Martha Reeves. Have you heard the news about Martha and the Vandellas? Martha Reeves movin' up the charts. Oh that Martha Reeves sure got soul. Let me tell you something, honey. Martha Reeves and her Vandellas couldn't carry the Mamazelles wig boxes. I couldn't stand them old cows walking around here like they owned the damn place. Right this way, we're going to go up to Barry Gordy's apartment. - Well you'll be going without us. - Don't mess with the Mamazelles. - And that's what you get for asking questions. - How was I supposed to know that woman had a bug up her ass about Martha Reeves? - By her makeup. (laughing) But you know what, that was kinda funny. The look on your face when she went off on you. - Oh I'm glad you're getting such a big kick out of it. - I have to, all that drama, Martha Reeves. What have we got here? (moaning) - Tammi Terrell was all that and a bag of chips. - You're so superficial. - [Drew] What do you mean? - She was a talented singer, and all you can focus on is the way that she looks. - No, I can just appreciate her beauty as well as her talent. - Uh-huh, you just did it again. - What? - You made her talent secondary to her beauty because that's all you men know how to focus on. - Wrong, it's just that men will admit to being attracted to physical beauty. Hell I think women are more superficial than men. - How do you figure? - Because at least men will admit what they're attracted to. But women won't admit that they're attracted to powerful men. - I'm attracted to what's on the inside of a man, period. - You are lying your hair nappy. - Excuse me, I am Madam CJ Walker's dream. - No, look at the way you practically had an orgasm up in Barry Gordy's old office. - So what are you saying, I'm shallow? I mean do you really think I'm capable of being with a man just because of his money. - No, not just because of his money but as well as. Look I'm just saying that a man has to have some form of power to attract a woman. It can be physical, spiritual, economic, but he has to have some form of it to attract a woman. - Now that's interesting. - [Drew] How's that? - Because I never noticed any of those qualities in you. - Oh wow, look at that. - Oh, you gonna go there. - [CeCe] Well, I went there. I'm gone. (hip-hop music) - So how far you going? - All the way to the top, they tell me. - Come on in, girl. Show me the way.

I just can't believe that you would ask me out all the while you have someone sitting over at your parent's house. - No see, it ain't really like that.

You can't even commit to a weekend. - CeCe. - [Drew] So how'd rehearsal go? - Fine. - What was the band like to work with? - Fine. - Ward Connelly was just elected president of the NAACP. - That's nice. - Tatiana, what's wrong? - Nothing. - Come on, you've barely said a word to me all night.

Did E.J. do something wrong? - E.J. didn't do anything wrong? - [Drew] Well who did? - I don't know Andrew, you tell me. - Why don't you stop talking in circles and tell me what's on your mind, girl? - Okay. Let's talk about what E.J. did. - [Drew] I knew it. Her flirted with you, didn't he? - No. He was a perfect gentleman. As a matter of fact, he spent the entire afternoon showing me around Detroit. - Ah so that's it. You pissed off because he showed you around, and I didn't. - No, that's not it either. - [Drew] Well what did he do? - Well he showed me the Renaissance Center, Greek Town, the Fox Theater. Oh, and he showed me the Motown Museum. - Motown Museum? - Yes, the Motown Museum. Of course, we didn't have time to stop, so we just drove by. - Did you see anything? - Enough. Enough to know that you're full of shit. - [Drew] Tatiana, I can explain. - Go ahead. I'd love to hear this one. - Go ahead, explain to me, Andrew. Explain to me why you brought me here all the way from Los Angeles to dis me for some other woman. Explain to me that while I'm rehearsing for the band for your father's retirement party, you're off kicking it with somebody else. Please try to make sense of this for me. I'm listening. I'm listening. - Tatiana, you have made this trip impossible. - Oh please, don't try to make this about me. - Oh, you have to accept some responsibility. I brought you here with the best of intentions, and you've been buggin' every step of the way. You tripped on the plane. You've insulted practically every member of my family. And you've insisted upon changing the program for a party that my sister has spent months planning. I needed something a little easier. She made it easy. But I didn't meant to hurt you, Tatiana, and I'm sorry. - You're not half as sorry as you're gonna be. (humming) You wouldn't. Tatiana, please. I said I was sorry. - Talk to the white one 'cause the black one don't want to hear it. ♪ Y, M, C, A ♪ ♪ Y, M, C, A ♪ (piano music) ♪ I'm looking for a party ♪ - Reverend, how are you tonight? ♪ I know it's gonna take some time ♪ ♪ He's got to be ambitious ♪ ♪ A man that likes to work ♪ - You see my brother the problem is not with the white man who see races.

(clapping) Where's E.J. - Don't worry about it, he'll be fine. - Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Firstly, I'd like to say when you look at this table. - Angie said that you could go on eighth. - Yeah, she did. - So it's all good, right? - Oh no, you don't get off that easy, Andrew. - [Angela] You're looking at love. - You used me, and I don't appreciate that, and you must be punished. - Tatiana, this party's going really well. Don't mess it up. - Argues the same way with the same passion and depth. I know you're wondering where my brother E.J. is. His mother-in-law became ill this evening, and he and his family were called away. Now that the announcements are out of the way, it gives me great pleasure to present our speaker of the evening, our moderator of the evening, Reverend Paul Gilliard. (clapping) - Now I'd like to bring up a very special lady. She worked in the public school system for over 30 years. She was brother Williamson's first grade teacher, Mrs. Bernice Watson. (clapping) - Oh, this could take forever. - Will you shut the fuck up? - Excuse me. - You heard me. - I said shut the fuck up. I didn't stutter. - Andrew, do not talk to me like that. - Good evening, good evening. You're a gem. I'm so glad that I had the opportunity to influence you in your life. You have been a dedicated person to this community. Your volunteer service with the boy scouts, the little league has influenced so many young men to continue on with their life. Happy retirement Ernest, and my God bless you all. (clapping) - [Paul] Brother Robinson. - Oh look, come on down. (clapping) (gasping) - I'm tired as hell. Sorry I'm late getting up here, but they got me way back there in the cheap seats. I could barely hear when my name was called. - He can barely hear because he ain't got his hearing aid in. - Now you just sit yourself back down, old man, 'cause I'm getting ready to talk about you. (laughing) Now as the Reverend said me and Ernie go back a long way. - Hey why is your boy looking over here? - He might see something he likes. - Ernie showed me what manhood is all about, responsibility, it's just that easy and just that hard. Thank you, Ernie. (clapping) - Thank you, brother. Another good friend of brother Williamson. Deacon Prior, come on up. (clapping) - And if you remember, I still have my song to do. - Look Tatiana, when you get up there, you can sing whatever you want to, and it won't change anything. - Oh yeah it will. It'll teach you a lesson. - I've learned my lessons. Let's see if you've learned yours. - I've gotta go get ready. - And brother Williamson came in at 10 o'clock and worked until about 1 o'clock in the mornin'. And then he was back at 10 o'clock to pass out the collection plate. Now I want to say an amen to that. - [Audience Member] Amen, yeah. - Could I have a water please. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Watch that gout there, deacon. - Hey, what's up T? - Your friend Andrew, he's impossible. - What did he do now? - It doesn't matter. He and I are like oil and water. I don't know why the hell you ever introduced me to him. - Greetings, Larry Cavanaugh, me boy. - Yeah, I've been wondering the same thing myself. - You have? Why? - Sorry Drew. I got to admit I've always been attracted to you. - So why did you introduce me to him? - Well your rep kind of proceeded you. I heard you were real high maintenance. - (speaking in a foreign language) - (speaking in a foreign language) Hey, I didn't know if I could hang. - Do you know if you can now? - No, but I'd like to find out. - So let me tell you that isn't the half of it. For without missing a beat, this man, he turned to me and say, "Well Larry me old son, "it's going to be mighty embarrassing "when we wind up at the hospital "with a foot stuck up one another's ass." - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Okay Reverend. (clapping) - [Larry] God bless ya, Ernie. - I still have a song to do. - Break a leg. - Another good friend, longtime friend of brother Williamson. Tatiana Michaels. - The smile on your face, all the time look at your face, back stabbers. - All's fair in love and war, my man. All's fair in love and war. - Drew, what is this fool getting ready to do?

(clapping) So I said well where have you been with some woman? And he said, "No baby, I've been walking around. "I lost my paycheck. "I lost the whole thing. "We don't have no money." He said, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. "It'll never happen again. "God as my witness, I'll never gamble again." Well Ernie is a man of his word. He never gambled again, and the welfare of our family always came first. And now I would like to introduce the man that we've all come here to honor, my partner in life Ernest Clarence Williamson. (clapping) - My cup runneth over. I'm not a man that likes to make a speech, but after all the nice things that's been said about me here tonight, I don't have a choice. I figured out a long time ago that the things that really matter are your family and your friends. So I just went about my life trying to do right by 'em. That's all. It ain't real complicated. I like coaching little league. Hell, I have more fun than the kids. (laughing) I can't imagine what my life would've been like without my commitment to family, community, work, and God. Seems to me that a life without commitments is a life not lived. (jazz music) So on that note, I'm gonna close. I want to thank you, each and every one of you for coming out tonight. May God bless you and keep you safe. Goodnight. (clapping) (jazz music) - As toastmaster, it's my job to offer the night's final toast. I heard a man once say, "Send me my flowers "while I'm alive." Tonight I find those words to be (paper ripping) anything but apropos and totally inadequate for what I want to say. Every man has to choose a path through life. And along that path, he has to make many choices. What he seldom recognizes is that each one of those choices costs him something. Sometimes, it costs a little and sometimes it costs a lot. So therefore, some of us choose not to make any choices at all. We're fooled into thinking that by making fewer choices, we'll somehow get off easier. But we don't. We really don't. In fact, I'll bet by not choosing it costs us more. So I stand and lift my glass to you, father. Earnest Clarence Williamson, to you. (clapping) CeCe, can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure Drew, what's up? - Yo man, go with me. Look, I've got much respect for your new relationship. I wish you and homey here all the best, but there's something I gotta tell you before you go. I love you, CeCe. I love you madly. There I said it. You can go now. - I love you too. - You do? But what about him? He's got money, and cars, and championship, n'stuff? - This is my cousin, stupid. - Cousin? - Yes, don't you remember Marcus from Rhode Island? - Little bean head Marcus. - Hey, all right now. Yeah, you know the one you used to kick off the court all the time. - But Johnson said, y'all was going to be fronting. - Fronting? Why would we do a stupid thing like that? - [Drew] I don't know what to say. - Yeah, you just be in the front. - [Marcus] Okay. - Don't say anything just kiss me.
