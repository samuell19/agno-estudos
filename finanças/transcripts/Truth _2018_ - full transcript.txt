Is it better out there? Than before? Your rebel leaders are still in charge. You haven't elected a president. But until then your leaders are happy to carry the mantle. The war isn't even officially over. After the initial revolution it's a bloodbath. I'm on the hit-list today. Tomorrow it might be you. - My name is Maria Ramsey and I'm your appointed attorney from the Truth and Reconciliation Committee. New government is gathering information to determine who deserves punishment and who should receive amnesty and become a part in the new democracy we are building. Do you understand? If you could please confirm your name for the record. Are you Lieutenant Colonel Xavier J. Faraday? - Yes. I'm Xavier Faraday. - Lieutenant Colonel Xavier J. Faraday of the Republic Army? There is no Republic Army any more. - But you were a lieutenant colonel in the army of the former regime? - Yes. - Lieutenant Colonel Xavier J. Faraday are you submitting yourself to the committee for amnesty. - No. - I don't think you understand. - I understand. Thank you but I don't want your amnesty. - If you don't do this the tribunal will see it as nothing less than an admission of guilt and that require... - What does it matter? My side lost. Guilty. - Please, I have to help you. It's what I do. I don't believe people should pay the ultimate price for their mistakes. Let me give you a chance. Please believe me. I swear. - I am former Lieutenant Colonel Xavier John Faraday. I formally submit myself to the committee for amnesty. - Let's start with your military career. Tell me about your Medal of Honor during the winter invasion. You were still in the infantry. You were wounded saving 17 men in your platoon from invading forces. Tell me about it. - I don't remember. - I find that difficult to believe. - It was 20 years ago. I have a hard time remembering what I had for dinner last week. - We could ask the prison chef. I'm sure it wasn't very good. I think this will help. Please state your name. General Thomas R. Theramin, retired. During the winter invasion you were involved in the Battle of Kerrigan's Pass, correct? Hell of a fight. I was barely a captain then. Lost a lot of good men that day. What can you tell me about Xavier Faraday? Was he in your platoon. He was, still a green kid but smart, brave. Saved I have no idea how many lives. Fought like a man possessed. Wouldn't wanna him dating my daughter but I want him in my trench know what I mean. And what happened after the invasion. When he came home they treated him like a damn hero. Hero of Kerrigan's Pass, remember? They cheered all of their survivors, gave 'em a parade. But Faraday got the damn Medal of Honor and the assignment of his choice. No idea where he ended up. - I do remember that. In school they taught us about the hero of Kerrigan's Pass. General Theramin, that's a great character reference for you. During your time in the Republic Army what was your assignment? - The majority of my service was in supply, nine years. - And when the revolution began, did you remain in supply? - No. - You were reassigned? - Yes. - What was your new assignment? - I was transferred to the north. - More specific please. - Bolton. - Bolton Internment Camp, correct? - Why are you asking me all this if you already know? - As I said, this is for the record. - Why don't you just look in your file? - You can't ask for amnesty for something you haven't admitted doing. - Are you really doing this for every soldier that you captured? - Cases that were involved in atrocities, yes. Like Bolton. - I was assigned to Bolton to be the executive officer of the guard staff. - From war hero to supply to a prison camp? - It's the military, it's the same procedural idea. Keep your higher-ups happy. Keep you paperwork organized and don't get killed by your own men. - Except I think there is a difference between inventorying cans of beans and extra blankets and overseeing a guard staff who interred more than 150,000 people over two years. - It's about forms, it's about numbers, it's about accounting. - That's a little cold isn't it? - Prisoners need blankets, forms. You transfer a guard, forms. There's a death... - I get it. - I didn't fight in the civil war, I did the paperwork. What were your responsibilities at the camp? Keep the guard staff organized. Specifics. - Daily schedules, payroll, training, disciplinary actions. - Against? - My men. - You never disciplined a prisoner? - My main responsibility were the guards and the support staff. Not the actions of the prisoners. - What happened to the misbehaving prisoners? - The misbehavers went before the commander but I tried to get my guards not to let it get that far. - What do you mean? - I tried to get my guards to put an end to problems before they got too big. - What types of problems did they encounter? - Cooking in the barracks, some contraband. My guards would confiscate it, take away some liberties. It was all manageable. Usually it was little things that grew into big arguments or grudges in public. Public is bad, very bad. If a prisoner tried to escape, it was public and they went before the commander. If the prisoner survived. I didn't blame the prisoners. If I was in their position I'd do exactly the same thing. but I tried to get my guards to understand that we were all in this together. So let's make the best of it. - Did you have regular contact with any of the prisoners? No. - You lived on site? Yeah. - I find it difficult to believe you were basically there 24 hours a day and you had no contact... - You said regular contact. I didn't have regular contact with the prisoners. It wasn't a social club. - No I guess not. So you issued orders about their lives without even knowing what was going on? - That's a bit naive, don't you think? - Do you think former prisoners would recognize you? If you were walking down the street and a former prisoner saw you would they remember you? - I don't think so. I don't think I really made an impression on any of them. I was just another face in a uniform. - Did you get to know any of the prisoners? - The handyman. Some cleaning women. - And you wouldn't consider these regular contacts? - I made it a point not to fraternize with the prisoners. Nothing good can come from it. - What types of prisoners were in your camp? - Please don't call it my camp. - Bolton, then. - Political prisoners, rebel sympathizers, anybody that the president and his government thought was dangerous. - For the record and context it included political dissidents, numerous university professors, and a large percentage of the native population. Would you agree? - I wasn't aware of an official census being done. - But it wasn't a prison for captured democratic soldiers? - That wasn't its intention, no. - Which was? - You'll have to ask the president, he's the one who set it up. But I think he's been executed so... - Huh, humor me. - It was set up to help control the chaos of war. - But the people in it weren't dangerous, they weren't soldiers or taken on the battlefield? - I didn't bring them there so I don't know. - Did you have women in your prison? - Yes. - Children? - Yes. - Dangerous children? Did you have sexual relations with any of the female prisoners? - No. - Any of the male ones? - No. I had them bring it for you. Go ahead you must be starving. Not poisoned. Why would everyone waste their time with me interviewing you if we were just gonna poison you? Tell me about your childhood. What were your parents like? - They emigrated here when they were children. - So they aren't native? - Like you? No, they emigrated here from Northern Europe. They were very cold. Very strict people, especially my father. - Did that affect the way you raised your daughter when it came to Ella? Did that make you more loving and warm to her? - Probably. - I hope to have children one day. Maybe when all this madness calms down. But you must be proud of your family to move to a new country and make something of themselves. - I don't know. We weren't very close. - Are they still alive? - My grandparents, they died a very long time ago. My grandfather smoked himself to death. My grandmother just willed herself to die. My father was killed during the artillery barrages of the invasion. - And your mother? - I don't know what happened to her. She disappeared shortly after my father was killed. - Help me understand this. You're surrounded by death, torture, agony. It's happening to them. I understand that. But did you consider the prisoners human, people? - No they weren't people. They weren't animals or anything. They were numbers in a ledger. You know we tattooed them? I hated that. But it eased with the administration. After a while there's something different. They aren't your people. The other soldiers, those are my people, my family. My people. - Family. Tell me about your wife. It helps people know the man, not just the soldier. What was her name? - Julianna. - That's a lovely name. This is her, right? Oh wait, no that's not her. Strange. Do you know who this is? - No. - When did you meet her? - It was a car accident. I rear-ended her at a stop sign with an army truck. Nothing serious, just dented her back bumper. Women were afraid of Republic soldiers, even back then, before the war. But not her. I fell in love with here right there, right then. I didn't even file a report. I paid for the damages myself. - How long before you were married? - 'Bout a year. It was wonderful. Then Ella came along. It was even better. Until. - When you were assigned to Bolton, what happened to them? - Julie stayed in the capital with Ella. Bolton was no place for a family. I didn't want 'em anywhere near it. I'd get leave about once a month and go visit 'em in the city. And I had an old army buddy who'd check in on them from time to time. They were safe, or so I thought. - And now? - I spoke with Julie on the phone the day the capital fell. She said the rebels had the city surrounded and they couldn't get out. And we had 'em moving in on us at Bolton. There was nothing I could do for them. Not too long after that, the rebels took the camp. - What did you do on that final day? - I drank. I'm not proud of it. I went into my office with a bottle of whiskey and I drank. I could hear the rebels in the distance, shelling our troops. And they were getting closer. But then I wanted to live, I wanted to survive. So I changed out of my uniform and I ran. - Before the democratic troops liberated the camp were you part of the purging of Bolton? - No! Was it an order from your commander? - There's no order! You make it sound like there was some sort of edict that came down from command. There was no order. This history that you're creating is entirely false. - Then what happened. - Madness set in. Discipline fell apart. Once the soldiers found out that the commander had left they turned on each other and they turned on the prisoners. Then they threw their weapons away and they fled. - Did you take part in it? - No, I told you! - So you were in your quarters drinking while all this madness was going on around you? There's a gap in the timeline. Bolton fell and a year later you were captured. - I stayed in the forest as long as I could foraging but eventually I needed real food. I found an elderly couple who ran farm. Supporters of the former regime, not fans of your revolution. They took me in. - Kind of them. - It wasn't an act of charity. It was more an act of defiance against the new government. So I worked their farm and when I could I snuck into the city and I tried to find... - You've been incarcerated here for how long? - I don't remember. - 274 days. When you were arrested how were you treated? - They let me clean up from time to time. - Were you abused? - Not any more than any of your other special guests I suppose. - Did you deserve it? If it was you, would you have treated a prisoner differently or better? Do you think you were treated as well or worse than the way you treated prisoners at Bolton? - I think I was treated proportionally as with all the prisoners at Bolton. And as for if I deserved it, no. I don't think some sort of cosmic justice is handed out by gettin' knocked around in my cell. - Are you a religious man Xavier? Never? As a child. - When I was a man I put away childish things. - 1 Corinthians. - My parents wanted me to have the best education possible. So for them that meant church school. I memorized a lot of Bible verses. Your family, did they survive? - No. - I'm sorry. - Republic soldiers forced their way into our home. They dragged us into the alley. I remember seeing the neighbors peeking out. Neighbors who were safe. They weren't like us. Or rather we weren't like them. The soldiers forced us onto our knees and they told my father to pick one. My father didn't understand. There were guns and yelling. But then he pointed at me. And the soldier shot my mother. And then they shot my father. - Is it better out there? Than before? - Some things are, other things are getting there. - Your rebel leaders are still in charge. You haven't elected a president. - It'll happen. It takes time. - Of course. But until then your leaders are happy to carry the mantle. The war isn't even officially over. - It's been over for a month. - I just meant that there's still groups out there, factions putting up a fight, a futile one I will admit. Even in my cell I overheard things. Your guards talking about your little revolution. Apparently it wasn't as glorious as your leaders insisted. - You're basing your views on new homeland off of snippets you heard from gossipy prison guards. - Well, you work with what you got. After the initial revolution it's a bloodbath. I'm on the hit list today, tomorrow it might be you. Odd though. My CO at Kerrigan's Pass, Theramin, he was a lieutenant, not a captain. Strange mistake for him to make. - He is getting up in years. - True, in fact I thought he was dead. - Do you remember a Corporal Jonas Teller? - Yeah. Troublemaker. I had to put him on report a few times. - He was transferred to fight the rebels in the final surge. And captured. State your name and rank. Jonas Teller, Corporal. You were captured? Yes. You said I could have food. Please answer the question. You were part of the military surge the Republic government used in an attempt to stop the revolutionary troops, correct? Yes. But before that you were assigned where? Bolton Internment Camp. I was a guard. They needed men at the front so they took guards from the camp. A lot of them. Corporal do you know the man in this photograph? Yes. Who is it? That's Lieutenant Colonel Faraday, our staffing officer at Bolton. What was his role in the camp in the final days you were there? He was tryin' to keep it together. They kept taking his men. I think it got to him. He would disappear for hours, usually with female prisoners. There was this one he had a real liking for. Rumor was he drank a lot. He started acting strange. Giving strange orders. Like what? I didn't wanna do it. It was an order. He said he would send us to the fighting if we didn't comply. If I had know I was gonna be there in a month anyway I would have refused. Refused what? He, he ordered us to sterilize the women, the native women. He told us to use some boiling water with bleach and some other chemicals... Did you do it? Yes. Heaven help me. - He's lying. - He's not Xavier. It's all true. I remember. What's your name? You can tell me your name, I'm not going to hurt you. Maria. Okay Maria, how many days has it been since you left Bolton? Maria you're safe. How long has it been? Four days. Did they hurt you at Bolton? Yes. What did they do? Maria, it's okay. We had heard rumors the freedom fighters were near. In the middle of the night the guards burst into our barrack. They attacked us. They, they raped us. Then started killing the women. Guard strangled my friend while he was still inside her. Right next to me. I though I was gonna die but suddenly they ran off so we hid. Maria? This wasn't the only time they hurt you. I don't want to. Maria, the other survivors, they've told us but I need to know your story. About a month before the end all the younger women, we were all brought into the mess hall and one by one were taken in the kitchen. We could hear the screams, but we couldn't run. One of the girls, Theresa, she tried and they shot her. As they stood there in line waiting for our turn. You could see Theresa's blood running across the floor. They took me in and strapped me to the counter. It smelled. They took a pot of boiling water and poured it into. They burned me from the inside out. Tell me, is there anything else? You're safe. Please believe me I swear. There was an officer, he chose me, I don't know why. Every Friday night he would send for me and he would... It's OK. Maria it's all right. - Hello Lieutenant Colonel Xavier J. Faraday. I'm Maria. No longer just prisoner 437721. It's funny. This is the first time you put a name to my face. My hair grew back nicely. No more lice either. I'm your inquisitor. There is no legal representation for war criminals in the new world. We need to wrap this up and move on. My job is to get answers to some nagging questions and then decide if you live or die and as of right now nothing has led me to believe that you will bring anything to our society. - What are you doing? - My part as an investigator for the new democratic government and Truth and Reconciliation Committee. Part of that job is bringing to light your activities at the camp including... - This is insane! I never hurt you. - You were captured bu police right here. So stupid, come back here. I would have fled the country to the mountains, no borders. Straight to freedom. By an old army buddy, by an old army buddy who is now a faithful democratic supporter. And why did you come back? Did you really think you were gonna find her? And why did you come back here? Did you really think your were gonna find your family? Your daughter was taken in by officials, given a whole new life. She's in a government school now and I'm sure she's doing quite well. As for your wife, two months ago she was still in the system. Now, honestly, I don't even know if I could find her if I wanted to. What a terrible thing to happen. Lost, forgotten, as a woman can only imagine. Lost, forgotten, and there's nothing, and there's nothing, and there's nothing you can do. And there's nothing you can do. This is a letter that was written to you. This is a letter that was written to you from your wife. From your wife, from your wife. But then she was shipped to a women's' prison. But then she was shipped to a women's' prison. It's the last record if could find of her. Last record I could find of her. "My dear Xavier, my dear Xavier. "I don't know if this letter will ever find it's way. "I am choosing to see this as a hope that maybe "we will now be reunited. "This slim hope. "But all I have at this time. "I love you Xavier. "I love you and my every waking moment "is spent praying that you and Ella are alive "but if I never see you again, "know that you are what completes me. "Before you there was nothing. "Even with our world on fire "and the thought that we may never be together. "Know I love you, know I love you, know I love you. "Know I love you, know I love you, know I love you. "My brave soldier. "But if I never see you again. "But if I never see you again." Do you deserve amnesty Xavier. You're a husband, a father, a genuine hero. Then the world changed for everyone. So was it just something horrid that happened during horrid times or was what happened the real you, you just finally had the chance to let it out? - I did what I had to do. - Don't you dare try to rewrite history. - I did what I had to do. - This is not a competition to see who is less evil. - Life is full of difficult decisions. You'll figure that out one day. Maybe when you're a wife or a mother. Ow! You're damaged. No man'll ever want you. Truly love you. Say what you want about me but I never judged you. It was brutal what they did to you. The boiling water, the chemicals forced up into you. When the order first came down I thought it must be a joke. I couldn't understand why they would want to... - You know exactly why they did it. An entire agenda to wipe my bloodline from a nation because of who I am. Don't act like you weren't tainted by it. You could've done something. - I didn't do it. - You didn't stop it. You could've saved me. You could've protected me. You could've ran away and taken me with you. Instead you hid like a coward. - You were just another prisoner that I wanted. I was the special one. You gave me extra rations. You would touch me. - Your imagination. - You would look into my eyes. No. It was real. - It's what you want to believe. - Did you ever disagree with any of the orders given to you? - My duty was to follow the orders given to me. - That's one step from I was just following orders. - Well I'm glad to hear you learned something in your crash course in international law. So do you really think this is a path to some utopia? That some golden era lies ahead. - Your cynicism is wasted. - See now that sounds like an official line if I've ever heard one. So is "I was only following orders." - This new democracy of yours isn't any different. It's just people making promises so you'll line up behind them. And when they break those promises, hey, you already pledged your loyalty. Better not go against the party. And that's where your true colors come out. That time where things are hazy and you can get away with so much. Theft, assault, revenge. Oh but Maria, you're above all that aren't you? You're the poster child of the revolution. The used, the abused, the victimized. But this war was fought for people just like you. Maybe they'll put your picture on a t-shirt. But for every victim there's an oppressor who has to be punished. - If I didn't know better, you are setting yourself up as the victim. - Some fireworks for your new democracy? - It was probably a transformer or a generator. Some of the equipment we've taken is a bit dated. As you can see we've made some of our own updates. - Equipment, right. - Tell me about your commander, Commander Bolivar. - How did you become and adjudicant or inquisitor or whatever the hell you are? - I found a home in the new democracy. I will help forge a new world. We will reverse the racist policy. We will restore the homeland. - Oh and you swallowed it all. I understand, I do. They offered you refuge, food, clothing. And their line of bullshit and you became a true believer. I understand. You had to protect yourself. But it's not any different than what you did at Bolton. You just climb into a different bed. - You are correct. I didn't receive a lot of training but the little I did was very, very good. And I don't think there's a person better qualified to prove what you did than someone who lived through it. - You and your little revolution, can go fu... Generator huh? You're under attack Maria. They're scared for their lives. Nobody's gonna come to help you. - Help! - They're running. - Hello? - So that means Republic soldiers are taking back the capital. They're moving closer, killing. They're gonna find us. What do you think they're gonna do to you? You think you've been through hell? - No. - You're a pawn, I can protect you. You're a pawn Maria. Little lost girl page. It impressed you. I didn't persecute you. I showed you how to be strong. I taught you how to survive. I showed you how to. And then look at this strong woman who stands before me now. Who's to say that isn't love? - You know you'll never make it out of here alive? - I've made my peace with that. - They'll throw you in front of a firing squad. And if you're lucky, in a dark hole the rest of your life. Dark hole. That's where they found us. A couple women and children. We survived the purge. Do you know how? We crawled into outhouses. We cowered in puddles of shit not knowing what was going on. And when the revolutionaries got there they didn't know we were there. They only found us because one of 'em took a leak. We huddled together clenching our mouths as one of 'em pissed all over us. As he turned away he caught a glimpse. They had to coax us out like animals, convincing us they wouldn't hurt us. Finally we came out, covered in shit, but we were still alive. It was you who ordered them to mutilate us. - No. - It was. It wasn't the president nor his cabinet or any general or anyone down the chain of command or to your camp commander, his second. No one until you. - Maria I can't help you if you don't set me free. - Why did you do it, explain to me why. - It won't work. That door's gonna open and I won't help you. - You gave the order! - Maria, I didn't do it. I saved you! You're alive because of me! You'd be dead! You'd be dead like everybody else! I saved you! Maria don't do it! I saved you! - You gave the order! There was not official order from your superiors. - No, no! - You gave the order for the sterilization of every native woman in the camp. - I didn't do it, it wasn't me! - You did it! Tell me you did it and why! You did it, you did it! Why did you do it Xavier, huh? Why did you do it Xavier? Admit you did it! - It wasn't me, I swear! I swear on my family, it wasn't me! I didn't do it. The commander was the order. He gave the order. He gave the order it wasn't me. He said he'd send me to the fighting. I didn't do it. Those final few weeks. Everything fell apart. The government splintered, the rebels were movin' in. It wasn't just you and the other prisoners. It was guards, the soldiers, family. Everyone got swept up in it. - But you survived. - There's some times I really wish I hadn't. My name is Lieutenant Colonel Xavier John Faraday and I was a member of the former Republic Army. I was the executive staffing officer at Bolton Internment Camp. And I had a sexual relationship with a girl, several girls. If you think that I need to be punished for this country to move forward as a unified whole, so be it. - Hmm. Do you know who this is Xavier? You know I know. - Nobody knows, it's not in my file. - Hmm. One Friday night at Bolton I was brought to your room. It was a few weeks before the liberation. I was still recovering from your sterilization order. You were piss-drunk when I got there. You were always drinking. Probably why you didn't recognize me. You've never seen me in focus. But that night you didn't want me. No, you didn't want anything but to cry. You curled your head up in my lap like a baby and wept about all the horrible things you've done. The rest of the country was celebrating your heroism when you raped and killed a girl in a drunken frenzy. But it was native girl so it was so easy to sweep it under the rug. Maybe you didn't cry like a baby. I might have just made that part up but the rest should sound pretty familiar. It took some digging but I am determined. - I was young, drunk. Stupid. I regret it every day. My commanding officer, the real Theramin, he took pity on me. Had me transferred to supply where I could serve in peace and no one would ask any questions. You're right. It's because of who she was that it was so easy. But I've changed. I've tried to be a good husband and a good father. - What makes you a good father? It isn't your behavior. You're not there for your daughter, you're at a camp... - I love her and she knows it. - Really? Really? Well hello there my name is Maria. What's your name? My name is Ella. Well it's nice to meet you Ella. Nice to meet you too. My you are a polite young girl. Who taught you that? My teachers. Not your daddy? I don't have a daddy. Oh, well what happened to him? My teacher said he was bad so he went away. I don't remember but it's OK. - It is? - Stop it! Yup, I have everything I need. I don't even care. - There's no way it's real. She would never believe that no matter what you did to her. - It took some convincing but she came around to new ways of looking at the world. Do you really think she was treated differently, Handled softer because she was a child? The mind is a malleable thing. Especially when placed in the proper hands. Be it adult or a child. - Did you ever wonder why Fridays? - Hmm. 'Cause you wanted to join in on the fun? The guards got their weekly pay then. They used it to get drunk and turn on the female prisoners. You wanted to be a part of the game. Big, strong officer gets his delivered to his quarters on a silver platter. - I knew what was happening to you. Do you remember what those nights were like? - Of course I do. - And then it stopped . because of me. I called you to my room every Friday night and you were safe. - You bastard. You think you were helping me? Some kind of hero... - Don't you act innocent. You knew, you did what you had to do. You played your own game Maria! You did! - Leave. Leave. The state police used these on me. When I was first round up they threw me into a cell with a dozen other scared women. They questioned us one by one. Tried to figure out what we knew. They tried really hard. Once they realized we didn't know anything. They marked us, shaved our heads, and then sent us to you! Why did you order it? Some sick inner desire to cleanse your nation? There were so many of us in that mess hall, waiting in line to go to the kitchen and we could those screams. You didn't even know their names. You destroyed their lives, I knew them! I knew them! Nicollette! Catherine! Theresa! Admit it, admit you ordered the sterilization! - I didn't do it! - Why didn't you save me? - Because you were just a number, just a number. There was a girl at the camp before you. Her name is Rose. I admit it I had feelings for her. I used to give her gifts, extra rations. Blankets, chocolate. Then one night she tried to escape through a hole in the fence and they shot and killed her. My men got 20 lashes each from the commander and because I was their superior officer I got 40 and at that moment, I stopped caring. - Oh that's a touching story. But that's exactly what it is, isn't it Xavier? Just a story. Another lie. Have you ever really cared about someone? I wonder about your wife. Or your child! Did you really love them? At night when you were finished with me, drunk and passed out I used to listen to you breathing and I had imagined you were somebody different or just different. You snore horribly. You were usually so go about hiding your life. You never left anything personal out. You've gotten really good about hiding things. In your quarters, in your life. You compartmentalize everything, your career, your wife, your camp whore. You compartmentalize it all, right? It's the sign of a sociopath, a monster. Are you a monster Xavier? What would Julie think if she knew about me or the boy you executed or all of your other youthful indiscretions? Would she still love you? Would you still be her big, brave, soldier? One day you were careless. You left a letter out from your wife, or maybe you wanted me to see it. Maybe you were reaching out. - That's your imagination again. - I read that letter. It talked about your daughter. About how they were safe and scared. About how she loved you. This woman, she had a life. A child, love. Things that seemed impossible to me. And I remember thinking there has got to be something good about you other than this drunken man who uses me and passes out. There's gotta be something decent about you! Give me a reason Xavier. Give me a reason to forgive you, to feel pity. Give me a reason you should live. - You had a friend at the camp. - Lucy. Did you ever wonder what happened to her? - You tell me Lieutenant Colonel. I don't know. She disappeared so I just figured she was dead. I mean no matter what happened she was gone which meant she was dead. - General, he used to come to the camp to fill his quota of women, for his troops. He wanted his officers to have their own whores on the battlefield. Natives only. Said that satisfying a man was the only thing they were good at. Then only barely. I knew he would choose you. There was no way I was gonna let that happen. So I offered up your friend Lucy instead. He took her. Yeah, you're right, I'm sure she's dead, but you're not. - Lies, I would have been informed of that. They would have told me, the records would have shown. - Yeah, yeah right. Your new keepers would have told you everything. Transparency in this new democracy you talk about. - Did your father beat you? - Yeah, my father beat me and I'm in love with my mother. Thank Dr. Freud, thank you. You've healed me. Can I go home now? - You beat your daughter. - No. - Never. Never laid a hand on her. Maybe she was acting like an annoying child and you just shoved her a little too roughly. Or maybe you drank too much. We both know that happens. Or maybe Julie came home late and got in your face and you just couldn't control yourself. But back here, in the back of your mind you wanted to. The monster. You wanted to scream shut up and then backhand her across the face like you did to that girl so many years ago. - I never touched her. - I don't believe you. I didn't know if we would need this but I'm glad I came prepared. Sometimes tying up loose ends can be messy but now that we've taken the capital and gotten things together other countries are happy to help. We have learned so much. The CIA has been exceptionally helpful. Injections for example. You and your Republic Army used to pump up prisoners with huge amounts of sodium thiopental until they talked or until they were dead. Barbaric. Our new friends taught us how to temper the effects. A touch of Flunitrazepam, a little midazolam and some MDMA to make you happy. This little girl has learned so much since the last time we met Xavier. I am so glad I get to use my training. Now, that does take a little while to take effect, but when it does, whew, nasty. When I found the file on your wife there wasn't much there, some notes, the letter, and a recording. Julie's interrogation. But you don't wanna hear all those silly questions. How you doin' big boy? This is what I think you might wanna here. Oh yes! I think they're just getting started. They knew who she was. They knew who you were. What you had done. Even if it wasn't real you know that's what she went through. But let me assure you, this is real. Listen to those screams. All because of you, admit it. Listen to that. Is that any worse than what you did to me? Any worse than what you did to that young girl when you were a stupid, drunk kid? Not strong enough? Easily taken care of. Nah, you're a big boy, no chaser. Shh, shh. Let me help you Xavier. Shh. Just let me help you Xavier. Just let me help you. I helped you didn't I Xavier. I took care of you. I did. I took care of you Xavier. What do you say? What do you say? - Thank you. - I took care of you. - You did. - Who am I? Who do you want me to be Xavier? Julie. - Yes dear, it's me. - Julie. All the things they did to you, oh Julie. Shh. - I tried, I tried to get to you. I couldn't protect you. Julie I'm not the man you think I am. I've done horrible things. - Xavier, Xavier it's me. Right here darling. Right here, see? I thought you were dead. Ella, where, where? - She's safe, she is safe, she's safe and you're with me. You're with me. You're here with me. Xavier, tell me the truth at the camp. Did you hurt them, the women? - No, no. Yes. - Xavier I love you, I love you. Just tell me the truth it won't change the way I feel about you. Did you order the sterilization? Did you? - No. No, no. The camp commander came into my office with the order. It was his idea. He wanted to sterilize all the native women. Wipe them out. He'd gone over the edge, you could see it. He said that if I didn't carry out the order immediately he'd send me to the fighting. I'd never see my family again. I wanted to beat him senseless. I wanted to kill him. I could feel my sidearm in my holster and I wanted to shoot him. Stop it. But I didn't. I needed to survive, I needed to get back to you. So I carried out the order. I carried, I did it. There was a girl, she tried to run. - Theresa? - And they shot her. And they carried out her body I saw it, I saw her eyes. Death, oh Julie. I never told, I never told, I'm sorry, I never told you. I didn't want you to know. When I came back from Kerrigan's Pass I didn't think I'd be alive. I was a kid. The whole country was celebrating, I was a hero. And then I saw her at that tavern. She was innocent. Different, it is not. I wanted her, I needed her. So I took her, took her. Went wrong, it went so wrong. I killed her. I'm sorry I killed her. I don't even remember her. I just remember her eyes. I killed her, I killed her I did, I'm sorry. And the girl at the camp, I couldn't save her. I couldn't stop it. And you and Ella, I couldn't protect you. I couldn't save any of them, I couldn't. I'm sorry Julie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please Julie please. Please Julie please forgive me please. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. - Your camp commander denied that he issued the order. Said that it would have been given directly by the staffing officer, you. The committee pretty much decided he was lying. He had a history of genocidal and racially charged positions. All of his other actions have been corroborated and there was enough circumstantial evidence to convict him. And execute him. But I was not convinced. I knew you and I wanted the opportunity to show my new friends what I was capable of. I just couldn't believe you didn't derive at least some pleasure from what you meeted out. I was convinced it was your way of ensuring that I would never be accepted by another. I hated you and you needed to pay. - Did you get what you wanted? - Whatever do you mean? - This. This personal vendetta of yours played out before the camera. - Oh that, purely for entertainment. Honestly I don't even know if it works. And this, dear, dear, Xavier, is absolutely not a personal vendetta, but I can't force you to believe me. I can't force you to believe anything. But consider this, I can walk out that door and recommend they drag you to the firing squad this very minute or I can tell them you are truly sorry, your commander was the guilty party. All of this goes away. But you don't know the woman I've become do you? So Lieutenant Colonel Xavier J. Faraday, are you an evil man or are you just a man who did evil things. Good luck Xavier.
