SO WHEN YOUR MAMA QUESTIONS MY WORD, SHE’S QUESTIONING THE WORD OF GOD. SEE, I BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS WORLD, AND I ALLOWED YOU TO STAY HERE, EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT DIFFERENT. AND I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT. IF YOU EVER THINK TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE GOOD CHRISTIAN WAYS OF THIS HOUSEHOLD... [sighs] DON’T YOU CRY HERE, BOY. I’LL HAVE NONE OF THAT. YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM IF YOU’RE GONNA CRY. - I THINK WE SHOULD GO SEE MAMA. - WHAT DID I TELL YOU? MATTHEW 15:4. - TO LOVE THE LORD, JESUS CHRIST, IN OUR VERY HEART, IN OUR VERY MIND, OUR VERY SOUL, TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOUL. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, ON A... - "...JESUS SCRIBES AND PHARISEES "WHICH WERE OF JERUSALEM SAYING, "WHY DO THY DISCIPLES TRANSGRESS THE TRADITIONS "OF THE ELDERS?

THERE WAS A FEW GUYS LAUGHIN’ IN THE CORNER. WE STEPPED UP A LITTLE CLOSER TO SEE WHAT WAS SO FUNNY. THERE WAS THIS SKINNY KID STANDIN’ UP AGAINST A WALL. HIS LIPS WERE ALL SWOLLEN OUT LIKE TWO GRUB WORMS. HIS FACE WAS STREAKED BY BLACK MARKER, EXCEPT WHERE HE CRIED OFF THE INK. BEFORE I KNEW IT, SHANE HAD ONE OF THOSE FELLAS CHIN-DOWN ON THE SINK, SPITTIN’ TEETH AND BLOOD. EVERYONE WAS RUNNIN’ FOR THE DOOR. SIX MONTHS LATER, WHEN SHANE CAME OUT OF CRAGGY, JEFFERSON HIGH CLOSED THE DOOR ON HIM. THAT WAS THE DAY I MET YOUR SON, MRS. PERKINS. THAT DAY IN THE BATHROOM. NOW THOSE TWO FELLAS PUT HIM UP TO THE BLACKFACE, I’M SURE. THEY DIDN’T BUST UP HIS LIPS. SOMEBODY ELSE ALREADY DONE THAT BEFORE AARON EVER GOT TO SCHOOL. - LIKE I SAID, I’LL DO WHAT I CAN.

ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED-- - THAT’S ENOUGH. HIT THE SHOWERS. GO! DANNY. I KNOW YOU AND GIL ARE TIGHT, AND I LIKE THE KID. HE’S GOT HEART, AND HE’S GOT ABILITY. BUT WHATEVER HE’S DONE, WHATEVER HAPPENS, YOU STILL GOT A GAME TO PLAY FRIDAY NIGHT. DANNY, ALL EYES ARE GONNA BE RIGHT HERE... ON YOUR FUTURE. OKAY? GRAB A SHOWER. - THEY’RE TREATIN' HIM LIKE SOME KIND OF ANIMAL. - HEY, DON’T COME IN MY OFFICE UNTIL--HOLD ON. JUST HOLD ON. DANNY, IF I’D HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE, IT WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED THAT WAY. - WHY WEREN’T YOU DOWN THERE, EMERSON? - BECAUSE I WAS WITH THE VICTIM. - THE VICTIM WAS ON THE FIELD. - HEY, LISTEN. JOEL AND ED HAVE GOT THEIR OWN WAY OF DEALING WITH A SUSPECT. AND IT’S A MORE CONVENTIONAL WAY. - YEAH, PERFECT TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE, I’M SURE. - HEY, DANNY. I GOT A DEAD MAN FOUND BURIED IN HIS OWN BARN, BEING CRAPPED ON BY HIS OWN ANIMALS. I GOT A RANCH HAND WHO EXCHANGED STRONG WORDS WITH THE MAN TWO DAYS BEFORE, ACCORDING TO THREE SOURCES, AND WHO RESISTED ARREST IN FRONT OF FOUR DOZEN WITNESSES, INCLUDING YOU. NOW, YOU WANT TO ADD STINK ON TOP OF SHIT? I’M JUST GONNA TELL YOU, WHAT YOU SAW TODAY IS THE WAY IT’S DONE SOMETIMES. YEAH. - [sighs] HOW’D TAYLOR DIE? - LOOK LIKE SUFFOCATION. MAN HAD A CLOSED SEPTUM. HE CAN ONLY BREATHE THROUGH HIS MOUTH. NOW, WHOEVER KILLED HIM MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT. GIL’S GONNA GET HIMSELF A LAWYER. HE’S GONNA GET A FAIR TRIAL. THEN THE TRUTH’S GONNA COME OUT. - [sighs] [dog barking] - WHOA! DUANE STINSON JUST ABOUT DIDN’T COME DOWN ON THIS ONE. [door rattles] BOBBY TURELLI TOO FAR BACK IN THE PACK. WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE DID LAST YEAR, TURNING IT ON TO WIN IN THE FINAL LAP. [TV clicks off] - WELL? - HE’S THE ONLY SUSPECT. - THAT’S GOOD, RIGHT? - WHY DON’T YOU ASK GIL THAT? - I MEAN, AS LONG AS THEY THINK THEY GOT THEIR MAN. - IF WE’RE REALLY LUCKY, IT’LL BE A SPEEDY TRIAL AND THE TOWN’LL CONVICT AN INNOCENT FRIEND. SHORT STINT ON DEATH ROW, AND HE’LL BE TOAST. CASE CLOSED. YOU’RE STARTIN' TO THINK LIKE A FUCKIN’ CRIMINAL, TAZ. - COME ON, MAN. THAT’S WHAT WE ARE. CRIMINALS. ALL FOUR OF US. LOOK, HEY, NONE OF US PLANNED TO HAVE GIL TAKE THE RAP FOR US. THAT’S THE WAY IT IS, MAN, ALL RIGHT? AT LEAST IT’LL BUY US SOME TIME IN THE SHORT RUN. UNLESS EITHER OF Y’ALL WANNA WALK INTO TOWN AND TURN YOURSELVES IN, WHICH I AIN’T GONNA LET YOU DO ANYWAY. - Y’ALL SHOULDN'T DRINK THEM THINGS SO MUCH. MAKE YOU THINK ALL LOOPY. YEAH, AARON. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE LOOPY STORY ABOUT THREE GUYS WHO DID SOMETHING PRETTY FUCKIN’ STUPID SO SOME KID DON’T HAVE TO SPEND HIS LIFE IN A CUCKOO NEST WATCHING CARTOONS WITH JUMPER CABLES HOOKED UP TO HIS SCROTUM. - THAT’S CRAZY TALK, MAN. - MAYBE IT IS. MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING HAS ME A LITTLE BIT ON EDGE. HOW ABOUT YOU, AARON? HOW DO YOU FEEL? - FUCK THIS. - WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU GOIN’? - OH, MAN. THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS REAL GOOD, MAN. LET’S JUST ALL GO AT IT WITH EACH OTHER, AND THE ONES LEFT STANDING CAN BLAME IT ON THE OTHERS. GOOD IDEA. DEAD CAN’T TALK. - I CAN’T STAND TRIAL EITHER. - DADDY SHOOTS BLACKBIRDS SOMETIMES. HE SAYS THEY’RE SPIES FOR THE DEVIL. THAT TRUE? - I DON’T KNOW. - I THINK THEY JUST COME AROUND FOR THE HOLLY BERRIES. - HE’D JUST SHOOT 'EM? - AND IT MAKES HIM LAUGH. THEN MAMA PICKS UP THE FEATHERS. WE SHOULD MAKE HIM LAUGH, TOO. I TRIED ONCE. TOLD HIM KNOCK, KNOCK. - DID HE LIKE IT? - I THINK I TOLD IT WRONG. - AARON... HE’S NOT COMIN' BACK. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT? - DO YOU THINK THEM BLACKBIRDS IS GONNA COME LOOKIN’ FOR ME, ’CAUSE OF WHAT I DONE? - WELL, THAT DEPENDS. YOU GOT ANY HOLLY BERRIES FOR ’EM? - NO. - I GUESS NOT. I WON’T LET 'EM FIND YOU, AARON. - DANNY, THAT RINGIN’ NEVER WENT AWAY. - IT WILL. - SHIT, CROW. YOU EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE? - WASN’T EXPECTING ANYONE. A LOT OF FOLKS’ HEADSTONES COULD READ JUST THAT. PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO BLAME IN A TOWN THIS SIZE. CAN’T MUCH KEEP 'EM STILL WHEN A NEIGHBOR TURNS UP DEAD, EVEN ONE LIKE MORRIS TAYLOR. - HOW’S GIL? - HE STAYED SICK OFF OF THAT CABBAGE THEY FEEDIN’ HIM, BUT, UH...HE LOOKS GOOD. YOU COULD’VE GONE TO SEE HIM. - I WILL. I JUST WANTED TO TEST A THEORY FIRST. YOU KNOW THAT DEBT SHEET YOU HAD OUT THE OTHER DAY? I SAW WALTER PERKINS’ NAME ON IT. YOU STILL HAVE IT? TRUST ME, CROW. THIS MAY HELP GIL. - YOU KNOW, WE ONLY PLAY FOR POINTS. WHOEVER’S GOT THE MOST POINTS AT THE END OF THE MONTH GETS A STEAK DINNER COMPLIMENTS OF THE LOSERS. OF COURSE, SOME FOLKS TEND TO GET SCARCE COME DINNERTIME. - MAKES SENSE. 1,300 POINTS. - MM-HMM. - THAT’S A HELL OF A LOT OF STEAK DINNERS. YOU’RE NOT GONNA ERASE TAYLOR’S NAME, ARE YOU? OR WALTER’S? - WHY WOULD I? - NO, I JUST MEANT, UNLESS YOU THINK HE’S GONNA PASS THROUGH AGAIN. - DEATH IS A POOR EXCUSE FOR A MAN NOT TO PAY HIS DUE. COWARDICE IS WORSE. AND YOUR THEORY? - SHERIFF BRODY HAS THE WRONG MAN. - WE BOTH KNOW THAT. - I THINK I COULD PROVE IT. - THIS IS A SMALL TOWN, SHEPHERD. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU. REMEMBER THAT. - [speaking indistinctly] - HEY, EMERSON. EMERSON, WE NEED TO TALK. - HEY. I GOT TEN MINUTES FOR LUNCH, AND THE SPECIAL TAKES 15. - SO DON’T GET THE SPECIAL. - AREN’T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE IN SCHOOL? - I GOT A NOTE FROM MY MOMMY. - DANNY... - SIGNED BY THE LORD HIMSELF. THEY COULDN’T REFUSE. LISTEN, THIS IS IMPORTANT. NOW, I CAN’T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN HERE, BUT THE PIT STOP MAKES AN EGG SANDWICH IN TWO MINUTES FLAT. - NOTHING’S CHANGED. WE’RE COMPILING THE EVIDENCE. WE’RE ASKING QUESTIONS. PERSONALLY, I’D LIKE TO SEE US COME UP SHORT. BUT THE MAN DIDN’T BURY HIMSELF. - I KNOW. I’M JUST ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER SOMETHING, THAT’S ALL. NOW, I’M NO HARDY BOY, BUT I KNOW GIL BETTER THAN Y’ALL DO. IF HE DID IT, THEN WHY? - HATE, REVENGE, MAYBE MONEY. MRS. TAYLOR SAID SHE SAW HIM SNEAKING AROUND OUT THERE THE DAY AFTER HE WALKED OFF HIS JOB. - YOU DON’T GO KILL SOME GUY JUST ’CAUSE HE STIFFED YOU A FEW BUCKS. I MEAN, EVEN IF THAT GUY IS A SPITEFUL BIGOT, AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU GOT A FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO. - I WOULDN’T, AND YOU WOULDN'T. BUT WHAT WE GOT ON GIL... MOTIVE, EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY, NO ALIBI... THAT’S ALL PRETTY DAMN SOLID. WE GOT NO ALTERNATE SCENARIO. - I DO. - OH, YOU DO? COME ON. - MORRIS TAYLOR OWED WALTER PERKINS $1,300. WALTER PERKINS GOT HIS OWN PROBLEMS, HE SKIPS TOWN. BUT ON HIS WAY OUT, HE STOPS AT TAYLOR’S RANCH TO COLLECT. AND HOW MANY FOLKS YOU KNOW GOT $1,300 LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE? TAYLOR DOESN’T. AND WE BOTH KNOW WALTER AIN’T MUCH OF A SWEETHEART, SO THE OLD MAN PAYS WITH HIS LIFE. TAYLOR WENT HUNTING ON WEEKENDS. WALTER KNEW THAT. MRS. TAYLOR WOULDN’T HAVE EVEN MISSED HER HUSBAND TILL MONDAY. - YOU... - Y’ALL OKAY HERE? - CAN I HAVE SOME MORE TEA, SWEET? - OKAY. - THOUGHT THAT UP BY YOURSELF, HUH? WHERE’D THE DEBT COME FROM? - I CAN’T SAY. - WELL, IT AIN’T GONNA HOLD A DROP OF PISS UNLESS YOU DO. - I WILL, BELIEVE ME. BUT RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO KNOW IF YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE. - ANYTHING’S POSSIBLE. - OH, COME ON, EMERSON. - I’LL LOOK INTO IT. - THANKS. - BIT CHILLY, AIN’T IT, MRS. PERKINS? - DON’T MIND NONE. - WELL, SOME DON’T. I’M EMERSON COTSWOLD, MA'AM. I’M A DEPUTY TO SHERIFF BRODY. - I KNOW. I KNOW YOUR MOTHER. - YEAH, I GUESS THAT’S RIGHT. WELL, I HATE TO COME TRAIPSING OUT HERE LIKE THIS, BUT I’M WONDERING WHERE I MIGHT FIND YOUR HUSBAND. - HE AIN’T HOME. - WELL, THAT’S KIND OF THE THING. UH, HE OWES SOME FOLKS SOME PROMISED WORK. AND A FEW OF THEM, THEY’RE KIND OF ON ME. THEY’RE WONDERING ABOUT THE SITUATION HERE. - WELL, YOU CAN TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN COME AND GET THEIR CARS AND DRIVE THEM STRAIGHT ON INTO HELL. SENDING YOU TO SLAP MY WALTER’S WRIST LIKE SOME NANNY ARM OF THE LAW. - IT AIN’T LIKE THAT, MA'AM. THEY JUST NEED TO KNOW, IS HE COMING HOME? - I EXPECT HIM SHORTLY. - WELL... OKAY, THEN. YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT ARM, AND... YOU GIVE US A CALL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING. - ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP. GATHER UP. [sighs] I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW, YOU REMINDED ME OF MY WIFE’S BRIDGE CLUB OUT THERE TODAY. AND THAT IS THE MOST MEAN-SPIRITED BUNCH OF WOMEN I HAVE EVER MET!

I LIKE WHAT I SEE. - YES, WE DO. - THAT’S RIGHT. SON, YOU GOT MORE THAN POTENTIAL. YOU GOT TALENT. NOW, I DON’T SAY THAT OFTEN TO FELLAS LIKE YOURSELF BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO GET ALL STARRY-EYED... - YEAH, THEY TAKE THE FANCY. - THEN I GOT NO USE FOR ’EM. BUT I CAN TELL YOU’RE DIFFERENT. THAT’S WHY WE CAME TO EXTEND AN INVITATION FOR YOU TO COME SEE OUR CAMPUS, MEET THE TEAM... - THE CHEERLEADERS. - [laughter] - YOU KNOW, GET A FEEL FOR WHAT WESTERN HAS TO OFFER, EXPENSES COVERED. - UM, WELL, I... UM... - DON’T THINK TOO LONG. - NO, NO, I MEAN, YEAH. OF COURSE, I--THAT SOUNDS-- I’D BE INTERESTED. - [laughs] WELL, HE’S INTERESTED. - WELL, GOOD. GOOD. NOW, YOU TAKE IT TO ’EM OUT THERE ON FRIDAY, AND WE’LL SEE YOU AT THE VICTORY PARTY, GET THAT VISIT SET UP. - THANKS. THANKS A LOT. HEY, UM...I COULD BRING A FRIEND ALONG. GIL PARKER? HE WASN’T OUT THERE TODAY, BUT... MAN, HE’S THE FASTEST BACK THIS PART OF THE STATE. - YEAH, WE KNOW. - HOW ABOUT WE HAVE JUST YOU UP, DANNY... FOR A START? I MEAN, MR. PARKER’S SITUATION, IT’S... - IT’S PEPPERY. - PEPPERY. YOU UNDERSTAND. - YEAH. - THAT’S ALL, SHEPHERD. GOOD WORK OUT THERE TODAY. - THAT’S A FINE BOY YOU GOT THERE, COACH. - THAT ONE’S A PILLAR. [gate clangs] [keys jangling] [gate clangs] [door slams] - GIL? - SHEPHERD? - YEAH. - DAMN, MAN, WHAT, YOU GET LOST ON THE WAY OVER HERE? - [sighs] I DIDN’T KNOW WHEN THEY’D LET ME COME VISIT. EMERSON KIND OF SNUCK ME BY HERE TONIGHT. - ALL RIGHT. - HOW YOU DOIN’? - MAN, I GOT THE RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER. OTHER THAN THAT... - I’M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS. EVERYTHING. - I AIN’T KILLED NOBODY. - I KNOW. - BUT THAT’S WHAT MOST FOLKS THINK, THOUGH, RIGHT? HUH? [scoffs] THAT DON’T...THAT DON'T... THAT DON’T WORRY ME NONE, ’CAUSE WHEN I GET BACK OUT THERE ON THAT FIELD, THE ONLY THING THAT THEY’RE GONNA BE THINKING IS, "MAN, THAT DUDE CAN FLY." - [chuckling] - WERE THOSE... WERE THOSE COACHES THERE FROM WESTERN THIS WEEK? - YEAH. YEAH. - YEAH? THEY--DID THEY SEE MY TAPE? - YEAH, YEAH, THEY... THEY SAID YOU WERE AS QUICK AS THEY’D SEEN. - FOR REAL? - YEAH. - [chuckles] OH, MAN. DAMN. DAMN. TOMORROW NIGHT IS IT, AND I’M GONNA BE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. FUCK ALL THESE SIMPLE MOTHERFUCKERS THEY JUST COME AND TURN MY LIFE ON END LIKE THEY SERVE GOD’S HAND. THEY JUST THE DEVIL OF A FUCKED-UP PAST. YOU KNOW THAT? AND THEY’RE ALL GONNA DIE LIKE THAT WITHOUT KNOWIN’ ANY DIFFERENT. JUST SIMPLE MOTHERFUCKERS. - GIL. I WOULDN’T TALK TOO LOUD ABOUT FOLKS DYIN’. ALL MY LIFE, MAN, I NEVER WANTED TO HURT NOBODY. IT NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY MIND TILL-- TILL THEY PUT ME IN THIS PLACE. - I’M GONNA MAKE YOU A PROMISE, GIL, AND ONE I HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP. YOU’LL BE OUT OF HERE SOON. YOU HAVE MY WORD. - SHEPHERD... I HOPE YOU’RE FOR REAL, MAN, ’CAUSE I NEED A PROMISE RIGHT NOW. I NEED SOMETHING. - TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF IN HERE. - ALL RIGHT. - GO ON AND GET THE REST, WHAT’S ON THE LINE. AARON, DID YOU HEAR ME, SON? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR HANDS? - THEY WAS OUT. - NOTHING WAS OUT. THEY’RE YOUR MAMA'S. - LIKE YOUR SCHOOL PAPERS? - NO, AARON, THEY’RE FROM YOUR FATHER. - WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - [sighs] THEY’RE FROM A LONG TIME AGO, HONEY. YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU DADDY WAS FAR AWAY THAT TIME-- BEFORE YOU WERE BORN? I SHOWED YOU ON THE MAP. - WHEN HE WAS IN THE WAR. - THAT’S RIGHT. WELL, I COULDN’T TALK TO HIM ON THE TELEPHONE A LOT OF THE TIME, SO I WROTE DOWN LETTERS, AND I’D SEND THEM TO HIM, AND HE’D SEND ONES HE WROTE BACK TO ME. AFTER I’D READ 'EM, I’D PUT 'EM IN A COOKIE TIN SO THEY WOULDN’T GET LOST. THESE ARE THEM LETTERS. - HOW COME THEY’RE KIND OF YELLOW? - IT’S 'CAUSE THEY’RE OLD. - AND--AND YOU KEEP ’EM STILL? - YES, I DO. THEY’RE PART OF MY LIFE. JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WROTE THAT NICE CARD FOR ME FOR MOTHER’S DAY. I KEPT THAT TOO. - AND DADDY BOUGHT IT. - YEAH. IT WAS REAL NICE. [sighs] AARON... I KNOW YOUR DADDY HAS SOMETIMES SAID THINGS THAT...HURT YOUR FEELINGS. HE’S DONE STUFF TOO THAT--THAT SEEMS MEAN, BUT... WHEN YOU GET RESTLESS, YOU KNOW, I TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT’S WRONG, OR I TAKE YOU TO SEE DR. HUSKINS. WELL, YOUR DADDY’S WORRIES ARE... WELL, THEY’RE JUST HARD FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT IS ALL.

WHY HE LEFT THE TV, I NEVER WATCH THE THING. - MRS. PERKINS, WE FOUND YOUR HUSBAND’S TRUCK. IT WAS OUTSIDE THE COUNTY. - WALTER WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS TRUCK FOR LONG. HE MUST BE ROUND ABOUT WHERE YOU FOUND IT. MAYBE HE JUST NEEDED SOME TIME AWAY, WENT TO A MOTEL. - MA’AM. THE TRUCK WAS 100 FOOT DOWN PAINTER GORGE. - SWEET JESUS. - NOW, I DON’T THINK WALTER WAS IN IT. - [sighs] - TELL ME, DID HE EVER MENTION BEING OWED ANY MONEY? - THERE WAS ALWAYS FOLKS SLOW PAYING FOR WORK... - RIGHT. - I DON’T KNOW.

YOU KNOW THAT WHEN I MARRIED LILY, I TOOK HER CHEROKEE NAME. WELL, SHE KNEW YOU FROM THE TIME YOUR MOTHER DIED, WHICH WAS THE YEAR YOUR DAD CAME TO WORK FOR US. SHE ALWAYS CALLED YOU "LITTLE SHEPHERD," ’CAUSE YOU'D CHASE ALL THE SQUIRRELS AWAY BEFORE YOUR FRIENDS COULD SHOOT ’EM WITH PELLETS. [chuckles] ANYWAY, WHEN YOUR DAD LEFT HERE LOOKING FOR WORK AND NEVER CAME BACK, LILY HAD YOUR NAME CHANGED. SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT A PERSON’S NAME SHOULD SAY MORE ABOUT ’EM THAN WHERE THEY’RE FROM. [dog barking] YOUR DAD’S NAME IS REED. HE TALKED ABOUT THIS PLACE A FEW TIMES JUST BEFORE HE LEFT. IT’S--IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE ALBERTA. - [sighs] THANKS, CROW. - I HEAR THE FISHIN’S REAL GOOD UP IN CANADA THIS TIME OF YEAR. STEELHEAD TROUT SEASON. I’D HURRY ON UP THERE, IF I WAS YOU. GO ON.

HE EITHER AIN’T SHOWING, OR HE AIN'T HOME. - TAZ! TAZ! LOOK, WE DON’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS SHIT. NOW, YOU CAN EITHER STEP OUT HERE AND GET IN THE GODDAMN TRUCK, OR YOU CAN STAY HOLED UP IN THERE, AND THE SHERIFF’S BOYS BREAK DOWN THE DOOR WITH THE SPECIAL BOOT THEY GOT PREPARED FOR YOUR ASS. YOU GOT ABOUT FIVE SECONDS, ’CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A DAMN EITHER WAY. - YOU MEAN THAT? - WHAT? - YOU DON’T CARE WHAT I DO? - [sighs] TAZ, WE’RE STANDING HERE YELLING AT AN EMPTY CABIN FOR ALL WE KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? - WELL, HOLD ON. - [sighs] - 129’s GONNA TAKE US INTO TENNESSEE. WE HIT INTERSTATE IN KNOXVILLE, THEN IT’S A FLAT-OUT RUN. - WELL, THAT’S IF WE STAY AHEAD OF ’EM. - OKAY, SO, MAN, LET’S GO. - WAIT. 1974 RUNS BACK INTO I-40.

REAL LIFE-LIKE TOO. - WHAT’S HE TALKIN' ABOUT? - I DON’T KNOW. THERE’S A PAGE MISSING FROM AARON’S BOOK. I NEVER FOUND IT. - Y’ALL GOT ONE MORE DECISION TO MAKE. SO TAKE YOUR TIME. IT’S UP TO YOU. BUT LET ME TELL YOU HOW THIS SHOW’S GONNA END. YOU’RE GONNA WALK OUT ON THE PORCH, YOU’RE GONNA COME ALONG WITH ME, AND WE’LL TALK THIS THING THROUGH WITH 12 REAL REASONABLE-TYPE FOLKS. - [scoffs] YEAH. - BECAUSE Y’ALL ARE TOO DAMN SMART TO DO OTHERWISE.

THEY CAN COME GET US. - THEY SHOULD LET JIMBO LEAD THE CHARGE. - DANNY... DANNY. - WHAT IS IT? - WHAT YOU DOIN’? - HEY. - CARRIE? CARRIE, STOP. WE’RE NOT PLAYIN’ AROUND OUT HERE. - LET ME SEE HER. - GOT A GUN. - PUT IT DOWN. PUT IT DOWN. - SHE KNOWS WHAT’S FOR REAL. - GET HIM BACK IN THERE. - [sighs] - MAN, I CAN’T SEE A DAMN THING. CAN YOU? - NO. [sighs] BUT THEY CAN. - ONLY WHERE THEY’RE POINTING. SEARCHLIGHTS DIDN’T MAKE THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. - FELLAS? WE’RE READY TO TALK. WE’VE BEEN READY. COME ON OUT ON THE PORCH. DANNY? - I’M GONNA GO. - OKAY, WELL, I’M GOING WITH YOU. - NO, JUST STAY PUT. - SHIT! - [gun cocks] - YOU’RE OUT THERE? - RIGHT HERE. - HOW ABOUT THE FRONT STEPS? - OKAY. SHIT, DANNY, WHAT’D I TELL YOU? - OH, COME ON, MAN. WHAT GOOD IS THAT? - MAYBE GET YOU TO THINK FOR ONE GODDAMN MINUTE... THAT THIS IS SERIOUS. WE GOT A COUPLE GUYS OUT THERE ACT LIKE THEY’RE SPOTLIGHTIN’ DEER. THEY’RE JUST WAITIN' FOR Y’ALL TO GIVE THEM AN EXCUSE. - ALL I’VE BEEN DOIN' IS THINKING... ABOUT HOW TO TURN THINGS AROUND. - YOU SHOULD’VE NEVER LET IT GET THIS FAR. THERE MUST BE 100 KIDS IN THIS TOWN WHO’D HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO HAVE YOUR FUTURE IN FRONT OF ’EM. NOW LOOK WHERE YOU STAND. DON’T PUT MY SISTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS AND MAKE THINGS WORSE. THAT AIN’T THE WAY. - THEN TELL ME WHAT IS-- - THE WAY BY LAW. - THE REACH OF YOUR LAW STOPPED AT THAT KID’S FRONT DOOR FOR 17 YEARS. YOU’RE RIGHT. WE NEVER SHOULD’VE LET IT GET THIS FAR. WHY DID YOU? - I ALWAYS LIKED YOU, DANNY. I TREATED YOU LIKE A BROTHER, ’CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT SEEMED SOMETIMES. BUT YOU’RE NO KIN TO ME. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO CARRIE... [door rattles] - [sighs] - WHAT’D HE SAY? - HE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? - BEIN’ WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW, I’D LET US GO. - THEN WHY DON’T YOU SUGGEST THAT? [sighs] LOOK. FIVE MINUTES OUT OF THIS COVE IN ANY DIRECTION, AND THEY’RE GONNA BE RIGHT ON TOP OF US. WE GOT SHIT FOR ODDS. - GREAT PEP TALK, CAP’N. - HE’S RIGHT, SHANE. WE CAN WAIT THIS THING OUT A LONG TIME, BUT THEY’LL WAIT LONGER. IF THEY DO DECIDE TO BUST ON IN, I DON’T KNOW. - NO, YOU DON’T. NEITHER OF YOU DO. [sighs] - COULD YOU GIVE US A MINUTE, PLEASE, CARRIE? PLEASE? SIX MONTHS IN CRAGGY PRISON JUST ABOUT DOTTED ME. OKAY? IT WEREN’T THE SICKOS OR THE QUEERS, OR THAT CRAP THEY FEED YOU. HELL, ALL THAT SHIT MADE THE DAY INTERESTING. IT’S WHEN THE WARDEN... IT’S WHEN THE WARDEN CALLS LIGHTS, AND YOU’RE LAYIN' THERE IN THE DARK, JUST YOU AND YOURSELF. YOUR EYES START TO ADJUST. YOU CAN MAKE OUT EVERY CRACK IN THE CONCRETE, EVERY PAINT CHIP. EVERY SHADOW. AND YOU RECOGNIZE IT ALL. ’CAUSE IT WAS THE SAME THE NIGHT BEFORE. AND IT’S GONNA BE THE SAME EACH AND EVERY NIGHT TO COME. FOUR WALLS. SO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, AND TRY TO IMAGINE SOME FIRM-ASS CHICK DOIN’ THE RHUMBA ON YOUR FACE, JUST TO GET A HARD-ON. BUT PRETTY SOON, THAT DON’T EVEN WORK. SO YOU START THINKIN’ ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, OR YOUR FRIENDS. AND YOU HOPE THAT GOD CAN READ YOUR MIND. THEN ONE NIGHT, YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, AND THERE AIN’T NOTHIN’ THERE. JUST A SEA OF BLACK. CAN’T PICTURE A SINGLE GODDAMN THING. YOU JUST LOOK OUT AT ALL THAT BLACK, AND YOU WONDER IF THAT’S ALL THAT THERE IS LEFT. THAT WAS SIX MONTHS. [rifle cocks] - OKAY, MAN. [rifle cocks] READY FOR THIS? - YEAH. LET’S GO. - GO TO YOUR BROTHER. - WHAT? - LOOK, CARRIE, YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE TO DO THIS. - DANNY, THOSE AREN’T FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS OUT THERE. AND FOR ONCE, I’M NOT IN THE STANDS, OR SERVING BARBECUE TO SOME HICK, OR WAITING FOR YOU TO GIVE ME TWO PRECIOUS HOURS IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY CAR. YOU CAN’T DO THIS WITHOUT ME. AND I’M GLAD. - SURE ABOUT THIS? - IT’S THE BEST COVER WE GOT. WITHOUT THE MOON, YOU CAN’T SEE YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE OUT THERE. WE SHOULD BE OUT OF THIS COVE BEFORE THEY GET A CALL THROUGH. HEY, THIS SHOULD BE A TURKEY SHOOT. - YEAH, AS LONG AS THE TURKEYS DON’T SHOOT BACK. - WELL, LET’S JUST DO IT BEFORE THEY TRY SOME SWAT BULLSHIT THEY SAW ON TV. - HEY. NOW, THINGS DON’T ALWAYS HAPPEN THE WAY YOU THINK THEY WILL. OKAY? - IF WE’RE REAL QUIET, MAYBE THEY’LL FORGET WE’RE OUT HERE. THAT THE IDEA? [gun cocks] - DANNY. THIS IS DESPERATE. HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU’RE GONNA GET? CARRIE, WILL YOU TALK TO HIM? - I GOT HIM, EMERSON. - Y’ALL STAY COOL. I DON’T TRUST NONE OF YOU WITH THIS SHOT. WHERE THE HELL ARE... [gunshot] [glass shattering] WHERE’D THAT COME FROM? STAY DOWN! HOLD YOUR FIRE. DO NOT RETURN FIRE. [gunshot] - [screams] [gunshots] - YOU WANT US TO JUST SIT HERE? - THEY’RE SHOOTIN' AT THE DAMN HEADLIGHTS. [gunshots] [gunshot] - HEY, HOLD IT, NOW! - AARON, DON’T RUN! - DANNY! - NO! [gunshot] - [screams] DANNY, NO! - [grunts] - HOLD IT! HOLD YOUR DAMN FIRE! STAND DOWN! - COME ON, COME ON, COME ON! GO, GO, GO! - BOYS! HOLD IT! DON’T RUN! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!
