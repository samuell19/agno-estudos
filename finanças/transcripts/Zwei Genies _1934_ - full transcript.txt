TWO GENIUSES - Thanks. - Miss Spatz, can you understand it? Not a single bookkeeper has applied. Unbelievable. Yes, and that although the sign hangs on a busy corner. That's it. - Excuse me? - I'm off for lunch. But of course, Director. - Permit me. - Thanks, Miss Spatz. If a bookkeeper shows up, have him wait. Of course. You may start on the additions in the meantime. Have a nice lunch. Bon appetite! Excuse me. But Director, why didn't you say something? Two, four. Two carried over. Pencil. A hundred. Come in. What do you require? No, I don't require. I merely permit myself. - Please excuse me. - It's quite alright. I'm much obliged. So? Oh, you wouldn't be here on account of... - Of course. - On account of the advertised job. Very much so, if I may. - At last. - Yes, I couldn't agree more. You'll have to wait for the boss. It'll be my pleasure. Many thanks. Are they looking for a bookkeeper? Yes, first floor on the right. One question, please. Do you think there's hope for me? One question, if I may. Do you think there's hope for me? Well, you are the first applicant. If it works out, you'll start at once. I'll even start if it doesn't work out. Excuse me. I mean, it's all down to the manager's decision. You see, some managers are like this- and some are like that- What's ours like? My boss. A fabulous boss. Calm and modest. - Even a little shy. - Shy? How pleasant. Allow me another question. You must know the manager. What's he like, as a person? Calm and modest. Even a little shy. Shy? How pleasant. Make yourself useful right away. Add this up. The manager will be pleased. Adding up? I'm to... I may? But at once. Of course. No. Thirteen. One left over. One. Fourteen. Thirty-six. Three left. Three. Add five. Come in. Seventy-seven. Excuse me. I hope I didn't interrupt. Excuse me. While waiting for you, I've been busy with these additions. Yes, I see. But please excuse me. This would be your seat. Please. Thank you. Please don't trouble yourself. Please, no trouble at all. Marvellous manager. Marvellous manager. Won't you take a look at my additions? Naturally. That'd be my job. I did all these additions in a brief moment. One carried over. Three carried over. Seven carried over. Your adding up is excellent. So is yours. Naturally. Oh, yes. Who would add up more naturally than you? I appreciate your acknowledgement and hope we'll work together well. That's totally up to you. Yes, of course. But it's mainly up to you, isn't it? To me? Yes, I understand. You're referring to the job. Regarding the job, when would you like us to start? - Whenever you like. - No, whenever you like, of course. No, I'm fully at your disposal. No, I am fully at your disposal. How about we discuss the wages? Oh yes! Please. Thank-No, first you. No. After you. No. After you. Oh. Excuse me. Don't mind me if you want to smoke. This is your home. Most kind of you. You know, I roll my own cigarettes. - So do I. - You do? Would you care for my tobacco? Most kind. Would for care for a rizla? - Many thanks. - You're welcome. A bit more? Oh, yes please. So then, concerning the wages... Yes, concerning the wages... Yes, concerning the wages... Would you care to make a suggestions? Who? Me? Oh, no. I... have to admit I'm not in the habit... Nor am I. May I? There you go. No. Allow me. First you. Wages must enough to live on of course. Of course. How much did you think? I'll take my cue from you. From me? Well, I thought... I'm thinking... - Well, two hundred- - Yes? - And ninety-five. - Holy cow! You think it's too much. Not at all. Quite the opposite. There's no such thing as too much. Quite right. We could perhaps say... five hundred. - Or perhaps 1.000! - Or 2.000! And 5.000 would be even more. Let's put it down in writing. - This morning? - Of course. Unless, perhaps, you'd like to eat first? Food? Marvellous. Let's go now. Yes, let's. The bookkeeping post has gone south, young man. It's been taken. Here's the scrounger from this morning again. You're right. And he's not alone. He looks shabby too. Do you like it here? Charming. Cosy. Elegant. Allow me. Me too. - May I? - Thanks. Your idea was excellent. - Let's set up the contract here. - Of course. - Please. - No. But I couldn't... Well, I... Waiter! - Paper. - And ink. And a dip pen. Make it two dip pens. Very nice. A good selection. Fixed prices. That's to say, I once tried the fried herring here. It was first class. A fried herring? Oh, you probably meant the fried chicken. I don't know how much I can indulge myself. Oh please. That's a good one. For you the sky's the limit. Well, that changes things. In that case I'll have, provided you allow it, roasted goose. Don't you fancy it too, roasted goose? Do I? Roasted goose. Marvellous. With apples. - Apples? - Yes. With red cabbage. Okay, red cabbage for you, apples for me. Waiter- Allow me. I'm a regular here. Well, of course then. Waiter! Two portions of roasted goose, one with apples... - Apples. - Apples. ...one with red cabbage. At once. Bring plenty of apples. And plenty of red cabbage. Why, order some for yourself. - Me? - Sure. Well, I... You. All right, but only if you do too. Very well, in that case. Two cognacs, waiter. Two cognacs. - Large ones. - Large ones. So, let's put: "Berlin, 1 April, 1929." "Berlin, 1 April, 1929." "The signatories, Jakob Senf, resident of Berlin, - "153 Krumme St..." - 153 Krumme St.? - 153. - 153. "...and Emil Pinne, 27 Potsdamer St..." - Pinne. 27? - "...A." Ah. "...enter into the following agreement:" - Colon. - Yes, colon. Well, first of all one should put down the exact profit share of each of us- The profit share, naturally. There you are. Do you know those two? No. The taller one trained as a clerk. But he's worked as a diver in Hamburg. Then he opened a bank. With a crowbar, eh? It soon went bust. Now he's totally broke. And the shorter one? He can't be any better off. It's those kinds of people. They're rootless creatures. Like cats, they always land on their feet. In... In this particular case, a profit participation of let's say, - 5- - 50- - 50. - 50. Naturally it's your call. Well, yes, 50 - 50 appears quite right to me. They're fine gentlemen after all. I said it all along. "The signatories declare with immediate effect, "the profit sharing agreement as follows," - Comma. - Yes, comma. - "A- - "...fifty per cent..." "...profit share in the business for both partners is thusly provided." Excellent, very good- What wine would you care for? RÃ¼desheimer 1928? It comes highly recommended, a fabulous year. Bring us the most fabulous year you have. Provided you concur, naturally. I concur. Well, now I got apples too. And I red cabbage. May I give you mine? May I? - There you go. - Thank you. And I'll give you my apples. Very kind of you. - There you go. - Many thanks. Well, as we said... The capital contribution needs to be discussed. - Quite right. - Do you have any idea? Idea? No. But allow me one question. What do you estimate the capital of our future company to be? Well, I'd rather you decided. Since you're in charge. But you are even more so. What do you think? Well, let's say... just under 100.000 marks. Why just under? Oh, it's not enough? Then let's say 250.000. Wow, that's a handsome item. Naturally, it'd be important to know what your cash assets are. Cash assets? I never mentioned cash. All right, no cash then. Of course not. - But funded. - Why funded? Your company as guarantee. Why my company? Well, of course. Now it's our... ...company. In that case we could name any figure at all as the basis of our company. Great. Marvellous. Why don't you name it? Well, 500.000 marks? But since it's not cash? 600.000. Quite right. It doesn't matter. How about 800.000? Wouldn't 750.000 suffice? Why complicate things? Let's say 1.000.000. A nice round figure, easy to remember. Done deal. Let's write, "One million". Those are big fish. They deal in millions. Yeah, I know the kind. They dress shabbily, but carry millions in change in their pockets. How about some champagne now? You're proposing a toast to the deal, eh? Champagne, waiter. May I enquire if the gentlemen are satisfied? Yes, thanks. We've had worse. - May I? - Please do. I assume you gentlemen are estate agents? - Yes, that too. - Would you care for champagne? - Yes, please. - Look at that. They ordered champagne. - The short one? - Nope. The diver. I don't want to be indiscreet, but would you be interested - in buying some land? - Sure. In principle we're interested in all kinds of deals. - I have an amazing tip. - Oh yeah? If I had the necessary funds, in the New West End... How much are we talking about roughly? Well, about 100.000 marks. 100.000. Any objections from your side? Of course not. From yours? None. I'll look into it. Naturally. The location is excellent. - They're planning a horse racing track. - Oh. The value will double or triple in two or three years. Buy it. Don't lose any time. There's another interested party. I don't know. To prosperous deals! - To prosperous deals! - To prosperous deals! I'm taking my leave. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I'm going there at once. - At once. The bill, waiter! Say, any objections to trading at the stock exchange? - None at all. I have a brilliant plan. - You do? It just came to me. You'll be surprised. - You asked for the bill? - No, he's paying. Did I... But no. Oh, you mean being your sozius. Well... Holy cow. How embarrassing. I left the house in a hurry and... Would you perhaps? Well, I also left in a rush. Why don't you collect the money from the office? Of course. Collect the bill from our office. 12 Pichler St. Of course, from the office. May I offer a cigar, gentlemen? Why not? Could I trouble you for a light? Here you are. Many thanks. Now, let's get to work. Yes. I'll see you when? Now, in the office. Of course, in the office. THIS LAND 110.000 SQUARE METRES IS FOR SALE THROUGH BOCK & HENNE Oh no. 100.000 marks is out of the question. But listen. Ten years from now the land will be worth a million. And 10 million in a hundred years. I can't wait that long, dear sir. All right. If you don't want it, somebody else will make a killing thanks to the horse race track. What do you know about the horse race track? Listen, there's no use pretending. I'm well informed... ...about the planned horse rack track. Horse rack track, did you hear that? Right, mister. My name is Wockt. Wait, Mr Wockt. I've made up my mind. I'm in a hurry. How much for that desert land? I regret, but it's practically sold. The gentleman is paying 100.000 marks. What? How much? In that case it's mine. I'm paying 110.000. Dear fellow, you can't keep up with me. I'm paying 120.000. So, 150.000. What's this all about? I've no time for banalities. Do me a favour and go home. You won't keep up with me. 200.000 marks. And that's that. Holy cow, he is loaded. Loaded, me? You'd be surprised, gentlemen. I don't have a penny. And that's my strong suit. But... what, I mean... why are you here? My business partner is loaded. Allow me, I'm Senf of Senf & Pinne. Business assets: one million. Would you care to see my credentials? Please, of course not. Surely in that case you'll be paying in cash. That's self evident. When the contract is being signed. Oh, I'll permit myself at once to fill in the bill of sale. Sir, since you're so rich why do you want to ruin me? You see, I urgently need this land to... to farm nightingales. Nightingale, you trot like a horse. Oh no, mister. Take your lousy 100.000 marks and rent a loft. I'd gladly compensate you. What, right now? Made out to cash? Yes. 50.000 marks. Do you cede? Made out to cash? Oh yes. All right. I cede. Many thanks, dear sir. Not at all. 50.000. It's purely for the sake of the nightingales. I told you already we're bankrupt. Then I'm just the man for you. Stop. Gentlemen, our company can only be saved by an immediate major purchase of our shares. Their value has declined for days. As you know, today's price is 12 %. Nobody's buying our shares. While nobody's buying they keep plummeting. Now it's up to you, gentlemen, to improve the company's standing by buying into it using private means. Our current situation is the consequence of lack of confidence. We're lacking the man with the means and the confidence. Therefore, gentlemen, any volunteers? I don't have money either. Nor do I. But I'm confident. How? What? Confidence in whom? Not in you. But in my business partner. He's got money. 100.000. 200.000.300.000.500.000. One million. - What? - So? Doesn't that suffice? I'll consolidate your company. Obviously, I'll want to get something out of it. So you want to buy our shares? Yes, I have an initial purchase on a million shares in mind. One million shares? At today's price that would be 120.000 marks. Allow me. I'm Emil Pinne! Of Pinne & Senf. Business assets: one million marks. For collateral I'll leave you the deed of association- Please, no. I don't ask for collateral from a company of your size. If you allow me I'll call our stock exchange agent. - I insist that you do. - May I? Hello? Stock exchange? Mr Bremer? Take this down. One million Batalia shares on behalf of Senf & Pinne. Excellent. Understood. Thank you, Mr Pinne. You're welcome. - A sensation! - What? Somebody's buying up Batalia. Batalia? They've been consolidated. Batalia? Impossible. But Batalia is bankrupt! - I'm buying. - Holy cow! The uptick is sensational since Pinne & Senf made their buy. What? From 12 to 26? - Unheard of! - Amazing! Reserve 10.000 share at once, Mr Bremer. Yes, 10.000. I want 20.000! - I want 50.000! - Me too! - 50.000! - I want 100.000! Mr Bremer! Mr Bremer? He's available? Thank God. I've been trying for a while. Pinne here, of Pinne & Senf. How much do Batalia shares go for now? Yeah? Can you buy some more? Aren't you a cutie? I want some myself. If you have a million, I get you some for 40. Just a minute! Yes. No. Why don't you get rid of mine? At 40 each. You're quite welcome. I'll pick up the money right now. I'm here for a bill. Bill? Two cognacs, two roasted geese? RÃ¼desheimer champagne, 15 cigars? What's this? I never ate at your place. Not you. Your bosses. My bosses? I'm the boss. You got it all wrong. No. Look. 12 Pichler St. Get lost, you! - You first. - No. You first. Here come your bosses. What do you think, Pinne? The door needs widening to fit the both of us simultaneously. Of course. I reckon this entire joint could do with a thorough overhaul. - But, I... - Don't stand in my way. Please, out of the way. What do you think, dear Pinne? Shall we sit side by side or facing one another? I'd prefer side by side. All right. - There. - Thank you. I'm here for the bill. Well, go on then. Pay it. - Me? - Don't just stand there. Pay it and leave us alone. - But I- - Don't you see we're busy? - Allow me to- - No, I won't allow a thing. Especially no shouting from you. - This isn't your place. - What? Of course it's my place. The cheek of that guy! He's probably the cashier. No idea. What? You don't know your own cashier? Excuse me, but he must be your cashier. No. Certainly not mine. Yes, excuse me, but you're the manager here. You're the manager. Allow me. I'm the manager! Shut it. Permit me. When I arrived this morning, you received me. No. You received me. No. I came to apply as bookkeeper. - But so did I. - No. If I had known, I would have never- Nor would I. What... can we do now? Yes, what... What is it you're doing here? Yes, what are we doing here? Let's buy this joint. Joint? Yes. 15.000. Twelve is enough. Agreed. 10.000 then. 10.000 marks for this office? Deal? We can go still next door. - No. Deal. Of course. - I thought so. The waiter's waited longer. Keep the change. - Thanks. - Now to you. - Five... - Thousand. And five... - Thousand. - Thanks. Many thanks. But gentlemen, what about me? - You, child? - You're staying. We're doubling your pay. KG subs by Tim Cooper
