Swamiji must be telling lies after keeping the sacred thread with h - Swami, are you telling the truth? - What, madam? - Are you suspecting Swamiji? - Hey. This is the age of Kali, moreover she is highly educated. She will understand if she experiences - You want sacred thread, right? - Today is full moon day. 10.30 and 12 o'clock time is inauspici Wear black clothes... ...and go and search from where you took the sacred thread.

How did it come here? Don't touch it! Go to Swamiji's house. Swami! Swami! Forgive, Swami! I didn't believe when you said ghosts exists but now I believe. As you said, sacred thread is there. I had thrown it away. I don't know how the sacred thread came to me.. over here. - Where is the sacred thread now? - I left it in the vehicle. Sacred thread is waiting who will touch it. You went and touche Even if you leave it, it will not leave you. Swami, will there be so many problems for touching the sacred thread? As you are thinking, it doesn't belong a woman, it is a man's sacred thread. Man's sacred thread? - Cannot she escape from it? - There is only one solution to it. What should I do? Can you arrange for a woman's dead body? Woman's dead body? - Tell him it is not possible. - It is possible. Apply powder, turmeric to the dead body and put flowers to it... ...and dress it up like a bride and tie the sacred thread to it. One more important thing, your hair, clothes, dust from your feet... ...keep them inside a box along with the dead body... ..and take it from the house located in front of the sea... ...and keep it at 100 feet distance. Since your belongings are there in it... ...so it will think it is your dead body... ...and thereby it will seek its reveng on the dead body... ...and will leave after taking its sacred thread. One more important thing. Don't go near that sea at any cost. Okay, Swamiji. Will our problem get solved if we do as you said? - Everything good will happen. - Thanks a lot, Swami! I will do as you said and then I will come to meet you. Thanks, Swami. One more thing, Swami. Anyway we are doing to leave the dead body box from 100 feet distance.. ...similarly can we shoot the arrival of that ghost. You are too crazy. If you want then try. Oh.

I am telling my father from the beginn He didn't tell you. He said I will gain virtue if I marry a girl like her. Son, please don't say like that. - My daughter cannot tolerate. - Father, let me ask you something. Instead of marrying mother... ...you should have married a girl like her and gained virtue. You want a normal girl but you want to get me married to such girl. First we should practice and then preach others. - Son. - Hey. Leave me! Don't do that, son. - Listen! - Son! Gayatri! Are you happy? Marriage got cancelled! Leave! Everybody leave! No, dear! Are you happy now? Go! Go and tell friends! Tell everyone that nobody will marry this lame girl! All of you be happy.
