Oh, Jake, finally. Oh, Eileen, hello. I thought you were my brother. Is Jake making you do all the work again? Oh, no. Jake has been banned from the kitchen since junior high when he almost burned it down making gumdrops. He enjoys the operational side, you can't over boil numbers. No, you can't. I'll have my usual. Okay, three mint melt-aways. Oh! And here is a salted coconut caramel buttercream for you to try. Ooh, you are a dear. You're gonna like that. Mm. Oh, I also need to pre-order two boxes of toffee for my grandson. Okay, two boxes, you got it. When does Megan get home? Oh, I was hoping for Winterfest, but she's studying in Luxembourg this semester, so probably not till summer. What a smart world traveller you've raised. She didn't get it from me, I am such a home body. See you next week. Oh, don't forget your chocolate. Oh, thanks. You're late. Sorry, Ma'am. - Come on. - Sorry. I know, I know, I'm late getting these to you, but I was talking to Ophelia... Oh, it's okay. I'm just glad you're here. I mean we have so much to do before Winterfest and I... Jake, are you alright? Oh, great, yeah but um... But what? Hey, uh... you free for dinner tonight? Should I be worried? No, not really. That's not reassuring. How about 7:30? Kerrie, Jake, hello, hello. - How is everything? - Hi. Oh, it is delicious as usual. - Thank you, Adam. - You outdid yourself - with the crab cakes. - I'm glad you like it. I still need to come by and place my candy order for Winterfest. Is Alexandra working this week? I believe she is. Great. - Enjoy your meals. - Thank you. So not that I don't enjoy being treated to dinner by my big brother, but can you please tell me what's going on right now? Okay, so... Ophelia got offered her dream job teaching English literature in London. She's beyond ecstatic, I couldn't be happier for her. Jake, that's fantastic. You are such a supportive husband. It's too bad Ophelia couldn't be with us tonight to celebrate. And how perfect that London is less than a 30-minute drive from here. Not London, Ohio. London, England. Silchester University. She accepted a job in England? One of their professors left unexpectedly, and so Ophelia flew out early this morning. She really wanted to tell you herself, but there wasn't any time. Okay, well... What about the store? I can't run it alone. Especially with Winterfest coming up. There aren't enough hours in the day for me to do everything myself. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've been thinking about long-term solutions, and I think the best one might be for me to sell my half of the business. I'm sorry, I know how you feel about change and this is a lot of news all at once, but in a major stroke of luck for both of us, there's an interested buyer who we both already know. Who? Brooks McLead. Wait, what? He's a financial genius and extremely successful entrepreneur. It's a gift that he wants to buy into our family shop. No. Not happening. Why not? Because I remember what he was like in high school, that's why not. Kerrie, that was a long time ago. Look, I'm gonna be in the UK for the next five years and... Five years? Gosh, Jake, I'm... I'm really gonna miss you. So come with us. We'd love to have you. I mean you've lived your entire life in Bedford. We could sell the shop. Every memory I have of Mom and Dad and Nanny and Pop centre around the shop. Mom and Nanny taught me how to pour the candy moulds. You painted the sign outside with Pop. It's our family legacy. It's our history. This is my home, Jake. Listen, I know that Brooks wasn't your favourite person back then. That's an understatement. But he's incredibly competent, smart, trustworthy, and his businesses always double or triple their profits. I just want you to have a nice nest egg to retire on one day. I can't believe I'm going to say this but... Okay, you can sell your half of the store to Brooks McLead. You won't regret this. How are you settling in? Ah, better than the last place. Why can't your next venture be in Hawaii or Florida, yeah? You can move us there. Brooks, what ever happened to that job in Silicon Valley? Check. Turned it down. After everything that happened in New York I thought, yeah, just... I just wanted to have a quieter life. The uh, Bay Area retirement community they... they had ocean views. And they offer surfing excursions. There's just no comparison. Sorry, Dad. Listen, you know you can always move in with me if you'd like. You don't have to live here. Oh, does your house have luxurious amenities, decedent dining, daily activities, an organized social events calendar? That's a really good point, I should move in here instead. Why, to cramp my style? I don't think so. That's it, check. You know I'm just hoping that one day you'll just settle down permanently. Look, I'm not gonna be around forever to take care of you. Tried it, Dad, didn't work. Sierra wasn't the right one for you. You could've let me know that earlier. Would've saved me a lot of grief. You wouldn't have listened, you're too stubborn. You always try to learn it the hard way. Thanks, Dad. Checkmate. I'm, I'm... - Rematch? - No, no, I got to go. I gotta go sign papers with the lawyer and Jake. Rain check? Yeah. I love you, Dad. I love you too, Son. I can't believe Jake and Ophelia are moving to England. Oh, I know and the timing couldn't be worst with Winterfest coming up. I haven't even told Megan, I don't want her to worry. I just want her to enjoy her semester abroad. You're such a good mom. Thanks, and thank you for coming on board full-time. I mean, we are going to be working 'round the clock to get all this done. I am happy to help. One of our biggest events of the year, and we already have more orders than last year. Ugh, and less than two weeks to fill them. And I will gladly pay you double over time. That's very generous. So, when does your new business partner start? Oh, they're signing the paperwork right now. I'm so glad this worked out. I'm really excited to be a part of it, perfect timing too. So you're sure you're not gonna miss the city? Nope, I'm through with it there. Really looking for a change in scenery now. - Ah, yeah. - So now this is taken care of, you wanna go out and get a bite and drink, celebrate? Yeah, yeah. Uh, it's gotta be quick, I need to get back for the movers. Oh, you're coming tonight? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah. That reminds me, I still need to place my candy order. For you or your customers? For my customers, of course. Unless I eat them all first. Which is what usually happens. Can't say I blame you. I'm surprised Brooks isn't here yet. You invited him tonight? Uh, no, no, you can just forward any of my mail to my new address in Ohio. Yeah. Yeah, I hope I made the right decision, too. Okay. - Hey! Hey, man. - Brooks, I'm glad - you could make it. - Thanks for having me. I got you something. I think I'm gonna appreciate this more than I know. I heard they only drink the tea over there, matey. Oh, hey, you remember my sister, Kerrie? Your new business partner. Hi. Hi. - Long time. - Long time. It's nice to see you again, Bean. Can I talk to you outside? - Yeah, sure. - Excuse us. Sure, yeah, see you soon. I've changed my mind about the partnership. All he did was walk in the door. He called me Bean! Well, I mean you did fail miserably at your attempt to create jalapeño hot sauce jelly bean. Oh, come on, you know that was my experimental candy phase. I know, I think I still have a hole in the roof of my mouth from it. That man made my life miserable in high school. It'll be better all around if I take a home equity loan and I do everything myself. That man uprooted his life to move here to help us. But if you really want me to, I'll ask him to nullify the contract and I'll refund him the payment. What about that little cottage you were thinking about buying? Don't worry about that. There are other places Ophelia and I can rent. Kerrie, I didn't want you to be finically strapped by taking out a loan. That's why I thought Brooks was the perfect solution for both of us. But we'll figure something else out. Okay, okay. I might be overreacting. It's probably just the shock of seeing him again. But you're right, high school was a long time ago. I'll give it a try, but if it doesn't work out... Then you can take out that home equity loan and you can buy him out. If it doesn't work, I will. It's a good thing you're moving so far away. You will thank me for this one day. Mm. Don't count on it. Come on, let's go back in and enjoy this wonderful going away party that you organized for me. Fine. I can't believe Brooks McLead is my business partner. Have you heard from Jake? Oh, yeah, he arrived safely and he's getting settled into their new place. So far they love Silchester. Oh, good. So how do you know Brooks again? High school. He and Jake were two years ahead of me. Oh, you were all friends. I wouldn't say that. Brooks was always at our house, but he just teased me relentlessly. He was always picking on me. I couldn't stand to be in the same room with him. Oh. A bully? Oh, no, nothing like that. You know he was just... popular and athletic, handsome. You know, that type. I swear I was the only girl in school that didn't treat him like royalty. - No wonder he liked you. - What? No. Though there was that time... What? Oh, nothing. It's such a long time ago, it's meaningless now. - Okay. - It was his senior year and he was hanging out at our house waiting for Jake. Eating everything in the kitchen, I might add. And he happened to mention that he didn't have a date for the Winter Snow Ball dance... What happened? Well, he said that he would have a better time going with me than any of the other girls in school. Okay, maybe I didn't dislike him as much as I thought I did back then. I thought he meant what he said. I thought I was his date. The night of the dance, he never showed up. Come to find out he took Erin Smythe, captain of the cheerleaders instead. Oh, no. Did he have any idea that he thought he'd asked you? Probably not. I don't know, I avoided talking to him after that. And then he moved after graduation. I'm sorry. It must've been devastating to your sweet little teenage heart. Yeah, well, it was at the time. Now I just hope he remains a silent partner that stays... Hello! Or not. Oh, hi! Good morning. Alright, ready to get started. Jake used to bring me here all the time. It's like my favourite place. Your parents were always so nice to me. Um... what are you doing? Um... I just thought I would promote some of the higher-priced products by putting them in the customers' eye line, if that's okay? I'm not interested in manipulating my customers into buying anything they don't want. I think you mean our customers, and I'm not interested in manipulating them either. But they can't buy what they can't see. You know the average shopper makes three unplanned or impulse purchases on four out of every ten store visits. Oh, let me guess, you're upping the odds? Exactly. Um... so do... do you think we could move the cash register over to the candy counter? What do you know about candy making? Absolutely nothing. Although candy is my favourite food group. Oh, this was a bad idea. - What's that? - Oh, I said, "I have an idea." Uh, we need to get a raffle prize for Winterfest. Yeah, all the vendors donate something, and then the money raised goes to the local schools' arts programs. I can do that. I can take care of that. Great, thank you. Oh, hello, young man, what is your name? - James. - James, are you here alone? No, my Mom's shopping next door. - Well, how can I help you? - Um... I want to get one for my Mom, one for Nana, and one for Lily. Well, aren't you a sweetheart? Is Lily your sister? No, she's my girlfriend. She's a girl and she's my best friend. Okay, I see you have your piggy bank. Wow. 10... 20, 30, 40... - 60? - Yeah. Do I have enough? You have the exact right amount. Here you go, my friend. And this is a little something extra for you. You got everything? Hang on, let me get the door for you. Alright, you go straight to your mom, okay? Thanks, bye. Bye, honey. What a cutie pie. Very cute, very cute. So just out of curiosity, how much free product do you give away every month? I don't know. I've never counted. Oh. - Is that a problem? - Uh... I hope not. Brooks, you remember Alexandra from Jake's going away party? Oh, yeah, of course. Hello, hello. - How are you? - Hi, busy. - Good. - Winterfest is ten days away. Yeah, so glad it's still a tradition. I have some very fun memories from Winterfest. Oh, it gets bigger every year. Used to a couple of hours after the student dance, now, it's a full day and evening event for the entire community. Hmm. Ooh, excuse me. Hi, honey. Mm-hmm. Um, does she clock out to take personal calls? Alexandra helps take care of her five-year-old niece so she can take a personal call whenever she needs to, for however long she needs to without punching a clock. Okay, just getting to know your modus operandi. We are a family owned and operated business. Our MO is we treat everyone like family. Good, good to know. Listen, are you free to get together for lunch? Discuss our business plan. Oh, I... I can't, I'm really busy. What about dinner? I mean, you have to eat at some point in the day, don't you? Uh... okay, dinner. - A quick dinner. - Quick dinner. Great, I'll make a reservation. Uh, your choice, anywhere you like. - Adam's Eatery is fine. - Okay. - Say five P.M.? - Five is fine. Excellent. Hey, hey! Hey, sorry I'm late. I got caught on a call for another... different business venture. Yeah, I understand that happens and it's not a problem, but anytime you're going to be 15 minutes late, a text would be appreciated. You're right, you're right. That was really rude of me not to text you. I apologize. Thank you. I don't know if you remember, but this used to be Margolitas. Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez retired. Oh, oh, that's too bad. I liked this place, they had the best chips and salsa. - Yeah, you're right, they did. - Yeah. Adam took over several years ago. He is really the best chef in town. - Oh, oh, uh... - No, no, sorry. - I'm sorry. - I got it. - Sorry. - Sorry. - Okay, thanks. Oh. - It's no worry. Oh! I, uh... I got it. Sorry. Yeah. - Sorry. - No, that's okay. - Is it broken? - No, all good. - Should we go in? - Yeah. - Thank you. - You were right, - that was delicious. - Oh, I usually am... right. I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Okay, I went through the shop's entire history. Oh, you're thorough. Mm-hmm, before I buy any business I do all the research. Oh, your great-grandparents, they have a very impressive history. Well, they did bring their candy making secrets over from Europe. Oh, here's a list of things that I think we should consider implementing. The business is not necessarily in trouble, but I think we can be doing a lot better. Change name to Murphy and McLead Candy and Gift shop? No, no. Absolutely not. Wait, you're right, that's a bad idea. I think it's certainly important to preserve the original brand name, not necessarily change it right now. You're right. Create an employee handbook? We only have one full-time employee. Well, for now but... what if we expand or franchise? I think it's really important to have everything in writing. That way there aren't a lot of miscommunications. You're very by the book, aren't you? I'm a businessman. That's what I know. Candy, good. Candy makes people happy. That was my great-grandparents' mission and it's mine too. That's what I know. And I admire that, I really do. And my purpose is to create more profit. That's for all of our sakes. How is everything here? - Oh, fabulous, thank you. - Good. The roasted sirloin rivals anything I've ever had in New York City. I'll gladly take that compliment. Good to see you, give Alexandra my best. I will. Well, thank you for dinner. As much as I would like to stick around and discuss marketing strategies and new signage, I need to get back to my candy moulds. - Oh. - Because without them, we won't have a business. Let me get the check. Oh, no, no, I got it. It's fine. Oh, thank you. It's a business expense, so it's a right off. Right. - Hey. - Hey, morning. You're here early. As Ben Franklin says, "Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise." Oh, and where does that leave the artist who finds their creativity at night? That's a really good point. Speaking of creativity, I want you to look at our new website. What was wrong with our old website? No, nothing, I just... just wanted to run a few ideas by you. Where's the picture of my great-grandparents? It's right here, I moved it to the history page. You changed the logo? No, no, no. Those are just options. - Wow. - I thought you could see them maybe in case you liked any of them. You don't waste any time. No. Wasted time, wasted profit. Did Ben Franklin say that too? No, that was me. You know, I've always been partial to: don't fix what isn't broken. No, you'd be amazed what a great website and a strong social media presence does for a business. We need to expand our reach. Brooks, I don't have time for any of this. That's... that's what I'm here for. Right. - Okay, anything else? - I thought we could offer free Wi-Fi service and then maybe after Winterfest, we could open a coffee bar in here so people could come and hang out. Wait, actually that's not a bad idea. And a hot chocolate bar. Yeah, I've been... I've been working with this new drink called a hot cocoa bomb. I'm not sure we have enough space in here. We might have to knock down a few walls, expand a little bit. Maybe find a new premises? No, I'm not knocking down walls or moving. Of course after we expand, we're gonna have to outsource the chocolate and candy making to a factory. - What? - But this will always be our flagship store, so if we invest in it, it's gonna be fine. This font is driving me crazy. Fine, you work on the font, I'm gonna open the shop. You're emailing Megan? Yes, I'm filling her in on what's happening around here. How Brooks wants to change the name of the shop, change the logo, knock the walls down and expand. Do you know he wants to find a factory to make the candy? Yeah, he's uh... very enthusiastic. And presumptuous and as arrogant as ever. You know I told Jake I'd give this a try, but it just isn't working. Well, isn't it too late now? Well, we'll see about that. So you own half of Murphy's Candies and Gifts? Yes. Okay, just to make sure I'm clear, you want to buy out this new partner - you told me about? - That's my plan. And what do you have as collateral on a loan? I don't have much savings, but I do have my family home. My parents put it in my name before they passed. I'm sorry for your loss. And the house is fully paid off? Yes. I wanted to enquire about a home equity loan. I always recommend a home equity loan or using your house as collateral. Well, you have a solid credit rating, no debt. Let me see what I can do for you, and hopefully, he won't be your partner much longer. I'm really sorry, but your ex-husband didn't sign a quit claim. You're gonna have to get him to sign a notarized one to clear the title. Oh, no, I thought he signed that. Well, that's gonna take some time. According to my daughter, he's in some remote part of Mexico working for the next six months. Oh, no, that means I'm stuck with that obnoxious, controlling egoist for a business partner. Oh. Okay, this is it. Clean! You cheating, kid? What do you mean, it's putting, how could I cheat? Hey, where's my chocolate? You own half of the best candy store in town, don't you? Sorry. Yeah, I forgot. Next time. What, what's the matter? Something wrong? Ah, it's... it's not going as smoothly as I expected. Well, unlike you, most people resist change. Yeah but all... all I'm trying to do is turn a bigger profit for the store. That helps everybody, right? And everything I suggest, everything upsets her. Huh, it's a dilemma. Oh! Did you see that?! - Nice shot, Dad. - It's like your mother always used to say, you know, "There's a... There's a lid for every pot." What's that got to do with anything? Well, she always used to say, "In the end, it's the people, not the things that matter." Yeah, and what do you say? Well, I say... that maybe you should look at the situation from your new partner's point of view instead of just your own. Okay, from Kerrie's perspective. Yeah, I mean, this is a lot of change for someone who's had no change their whole life. Yeah. Alright, that can't be easy. Mm-hmm. Here you go, have a great day. Alright. Oh, sorry. - Don't say it. - Say what? That you might've been right about moving the register. Oh, no, I didn't say a word. Yeah, well you didn't have to. I can see it all over your face. I can't help it if you're a highly perceptive woman. I got you something. Yeah. - Here. - That's for me? Yeah, you said we needed it. - What? - It's the prize for the raffle. It's a jelly bean jar, Bean. Yeah, great, I see that. Okay. - You like it? - I... It's perfect. Okay. Listen, I got this, um, display case. I think it's gonna fit perfectly, I just have to put it together. Jelly beans, that's funny. Oh, yeah. Real funny. Oh. Oh, dear. I better go help him before he ruins the whole shop. Uh, take it easy on him. He means well. Fiddle sticks. - Is everything okay? - Oh, yeah. It's fine. You know, I didn't realize you and my brother kept in touch all these years. He never mentioned anything. Yeah, I thought about him through the years, but we actually connected on a high school class's social media page. Oh, I'm surprised you left an exciting city like New York. Well, I had my reasons, you know. I don't know if you remember this, but my dad, he was in the Air Force. Oh, right, I did know that. Well, 'cause of his job we'd move all the time and I uh... just kind of got used to that. I don't think I've ever lived anywhere longer than two years. You know, so I guess it was just... it was time for me to make a change. That must be hard on your friendships or relationships. Yeah, I guess so. But you know, I get restless. I just get that restless feeling. I want to move, you know? Uh... No, actually I don't know. I'm not a big fan of change. I've lived in the same house in the same town and had the same job, well, apart from babysitting, my whole life. What about college? Uh, well, the university's regional campus was 30 miles away, so I lived at home. Unlike my daughter, who went as far away as possible. You must have missed her, I'm sure. Very much. But she is following her dreams and I'm really proud of her. That's uh... that's amazing. Yeah, she tells me about her adventures. But I like it here in Bedford. I'm content. Are you content or are you happy? Well, aren't they the same thing? Well, no, not really. Okay, isn't there anything you've ever wanted to do, that's not in this little town? Well, I have always wanted to go to Europe. My great-grandparents, they're from a small village in Belgium. It's actually where they learned their candy making secrets. You should go. Just book a ticket. Make a reservation and go! You make it sound so easy. I mean, between school and taking care of my parents, and raising Megan, and then taking over at the shop, there was just never enough time. But I'm sure I'll get there one day. I hope you do. Well, I guess I'd better get back to the kitchen. Yes, I'm her aunt. Does she have a temperature? No? Okay, good. I'm on my way. Is everything okay? No, that was the school nurse. Paige isn't feeling well. I have to go pick her up and take her home. Take your time, I hope she feels better. Alright, thanks. Oh, hi. Bye. - Where's the fire? - Oh, she had to get her niece. Oh, okay... um... listen. Can we meet for lunch? My treat. Oh, I would love that, but with Winterfest five days away, I am so busy. No, that's exactly what we need to discuss. But um... you know what? If you're busy, I'll go get sandwiches and I'll bring them back here and we can eat here. Yeah but... That's okay. I... I could probably use some fresh air. Just give me 20 minutes to finish this. Great. I'll meet you in the square? - Yes, sure. - Great. May I have one? Oh, are you gonna personally cover the cost for that? You know I'm good for it. Uh... okay. Wow... that's amazing. That's even better than I remembered it. I had gourmet chocolate all over the world - that doesn't compare to that. - Well, that means a lot. - Thank you. - Our price point's way too low. Oh, here we go. No, you're way under valuing the product. Okay, look, I really appreciate the compliment, but there are a lot of hard-working people in this town trying to make ends meet, and they shouldn't have to budget to treat themselves to some candy. Oh, okay, point taken. Um... - I'll see you in the square. - Yeah. Mmm! So good! Brooks. Wha... Hi. Erin Smythe. We went to high school together. That's right. Hi, how are you? Nice to see you. Um... so what... What have you been doing? Where are you living now? What's your work? Tell me everything. Well, my parents still have a place here and I have a satellite office in Cincinnati. I am... an executive head hunter. - That's impressive. - What's impressive is your career. I've been watching it over the years. - I've been very fortunate. - Mmm. What surprised me was the candy shop, though. That's such a huge departure from your usual ventures. It is, but it's nice to be back here in Bedford. Mmm. - Hi. - Hey. I don't mean to interrupt, we can talk later. No, Kerrie, do you remember Erin Smythe? That's still the last name you go by? Yes, yes. I've never married. Oh, yeah, I sure do. Erin, how are you? Good, thanks for asking. This is Kerrie, Jake's little sister, my new business partner. Oh, Jake, I adored him. He was the best. He still is. - I'll tell him you said hello. - Please do. So you got to come by the shop sometime. She makes the most unbelievable chocolate and candies. Sounds delicious, but I don't eat sugar. Alright, well, I don't want to keep you two from your business, so we should catch up more later. I'd love that. That'd be great. Alright. Uh... Italian or turkey? Oh, Italian. - Hey. - Oh, thank you. So I have been going through the financials for the past five years. And I think with a few changes uh... We can double last year's numbers. This is the amount of free product that was given away last year. What? I thought that was a charitable tax write-off. Charity is a wonderful thing, but um... I think that number's way too high. There are a lot of deserving people, Brooks. There's first responders, teachers, the elderly at the senior village. You are a bleeding heart, Kerrie Murphy. Yes, it bleeds candy. Brooks, not everything is about the bottom line. Well, unfortunately when you're running a business and you're trying to be in the black, it is. If that's all you care about, why did you buy into a small family owned business? We are a far cry from a Fortune 500 company. No, I see great potential. Why did you buy Jake out? 'Cause Willy Wonka's my favourite movie. I've always wanted to own a candy factory. I'm sorry we don't have a chocolate river for you to fall in. Or Oompa Loompas. That'd be great, wouldn't it? It'd really help you out. That's important, by the way, a strong work-life balance. To the bottom line. Well, if you're exhausted and burnt out, you're of no use to me. No, but seriously. You do, you work all the time, you're really devoted to the shop. You need some down time. Why don't you take a vacation or a staycation? It has been a while since I've had any time off. I didn't even take a honeymoon. Free time, I don't know what I'd do with myself. Take a trip to Europe? Alone? No. How long has it been since you were divorced? I mean... sorry, that's a personal question. It's okay, um... I got married relatively young and the marriage lasted about four years. I naively thought that love could conquer all our differences. But he's a good dad to Megan and that's all that matters. What about you? Oh, never... never married, no kids. Huh. But I am known to all my friends' children as Fun Uncle Brooks. I was voted life of the party in high school. - Do you remember that? - Oh, right. So that's the real reason you wanted to buy into the candy store. - You wanted to keep your title. - Well, yeah, of course. You're seeing right through me right now. How is Paige feeling? Oh, it's just a tummy ache, she's back to a hundred percent. Oh, good, I'm glad. Have you heard from Megan, how's she doing? Oh, she is having the time of her life visiting a different country every weekend. - Oh. - You want some more hot cocoa? Oh, well, I'm good, thanks. Oh! I found this, this morning. I have been dying to show you. Wait... - Look, look, look. - Oh! Looks like a year book. - Yes, it is! - Let's see! Look. This is me. Right here, my sophomore year. You are adorable. Goodness, where does the time go? Let me see if I can find my brother. - Oh, there he is. - Oh, look at Jake. What was his senior quote? Oh, uh, "Life is like a box of candies, you get what you get and you don't get upset." That is fitting. Mm-hmm. Oh, and here is Brooks. - Oh! He was handsome. - Mmm... And looked super confident even back then. Hm, confident, arrogant, whatever you want to call it. "Life belongs to the living and he who lives must be prepared for changes." That's pretty deep quote for a teenager. Hmm. And the polar opposite to your outlook on change. Yeah, I guess that's true. Thank you. Here's an order form. Order form for you? Order form for you. Oh, Adam. Order form? Thanks. - Do you have a pen? - Oh, yep. Ah. Thank you. - What do you recommend? - Oh, I mean, everything here is delicious. That's the problem. Here's a better question, what's your favourite? Oh, um... peppermint bark. Peppermint bark, it is. Wow, you guys are busier than ever. Yeah, we are, it's gonna be crazy until after Winterfest. Uh... I actually wanted to ask if I could... I guess I'll catch you later. - Yes, please. - Yeah. I'll be back with more forms. Bye. Thank you. Hi, I'll have three mint melt-aways, three of your new salted coconut caramel buttercreams, please. Three... Here you go. Kerrie always gives me a sample. Uh... - Don't tell anyone. - It'll be our little secret. Oh, you need someone sweet in your life. Well, no, I have my dad. Although I wouldn't call him sweet. The word I'd use is "cantankerous". Well, keep your eye open. You never know. Thank you. Oh my goodness, you weren't kidding. It's the busiest time of year, it's like a madhouse out there. We're out of vanilla buttercreams. No, we're not, I made a batch earlier this morning. - I'll go get them. - You are unbelievable. You're just figuring that out? Teenage boys are not known for their wisdom. Oh, yeah, what's your excuse now? It's unbelievable how good these are. Some day you have to teach me your magical candy-making secrets. Well, I'm making chocolate snow flakes tonight, you're welcome to stick around and help if you want. - Really? - Sure. I wouldn't be in the way? And if you are, I'll kick you out. I believe you would. Yeah, I'd love that. I'll bring coffee. Oh, make it a hot cider and you're on. Aye, aye, Bean. Oh, thank you. - Don't give me that look. - Hmm... Oh, hi, Erin, how are you? You will never guess who I just got off the phone with. A global top ten company and they are looking for a new COO. I immediately thought of you. Global top ten. Wow, that's incredible. As you know, these positions rarely open up, they are highly coveted and very prestigious. Not to mention the bonuses and the benefits. Now, their main office is in California, but they would be open to you working from the Cincinnati office. I told them all about you, they're very impressed. Wow, wow. They want to meet you. I... listen, I... I know this is a once in a lifetime offer and I'm very flattered but... Listen, you don't need to decide this minute. Take some time, alright? Alright. Listen, I've got another call, I will fill you in on the rest of the details later. How does over a late dinner sound? Okay... okay sure but... Great, can't wait. Okay, ready for my first lesson. Alright. This is a cacao bean from South America. Yeah. Our family's been doing business with the same cocoa farm for generations. Oh, it's not like a coffee bean but with a little alchemy, it'll turn into... Liquid gold. Yes. And there's a reason they say chocolate is the food of the gods. Um... pick a mould. Okay, any mould? Any mould. Uh... oh! I'll do that, winter tulips. Oh, you're a romantic. Who knew? I think people are beginning to suspect. Okay, this is your chocolate, it's the right temperature. - Okay. - It's pretty simple. You're gonna take it and you're gonna pour it into this mould. You're an artist and chocolate is your medium. I think it is a good combination of art and science. You know, I never get to do anything creative in my line of work. It's all spread sheets and numbers. - Hmm... - This is fun. Well, if you think this is fun wait till we make butterscotch candy pillows. Have you ever thought about teaching a class? Actually, I... I would like to teach a class. In fact, Jake and I talked about that, and then we never organized anything. Really? I'll be happy to set that up for you if you want. - Really? - No problem. Thanks. - Oh! Um... - Oh. That's okay. That's okay. We're just gonna do this. All you have to do is dip that... and it'll fill all the moulds. Hello! Oh, Erin! Hi, how are you? - Hi. - Come in. Thanks. You didn't text me back about what time you wanted to have that late dinner. Oh, um... I... Sorry, my phone was off and we were just in the middle of... Kerrie's teaching how to make and pour chocolate moulds. Yeah, I find that's a useful skill for a candy shop owner. Of course. Oh, who knew you of all people would've turned out to be Willy Wonka? That's actually just what we were saying. Well, you should get going. No, but the lesson with... Oh, no, it's fine. We can do it another time, go have fun. - Oh, I... - Come on. She doesn't mind. Alright, I'm gonna go get my coat. Do you want some candy? Oh, no, you don't eat sugar. Right. What was I thinking? I practically kicked him out the door. Sounds like someone's catching feelings. What is that, like catching a cold? Girl, it means you like him. No. No, no, no. I mean I will admit the business partnership is working out better than I expected, but no. I do not need any romantic entanglements to complicate my life. I like my life just the way it is. Change isn't always a bad thing. Like you said, the new partnership is working out, maybe a new relationship will too. Even if... no. Anyway, he's dating Erin. That's the cheerleader he took to the dance over me. - You're kidding? - But it's okay, if he's happy, I'm happy for him. I see the way you two look at each other. I wouldn't write him off just yet. Alexandra! You forgot your scarf, I wouldn't want your neck to get cold. Oh, that was so thoughtful of you, thank you. Anytime. Ah. Looks like someone else is catching feelings. Oh! He's just being friendly. He's a very conscientious restaurateur. I don't know about that. If I left my scarf, I'm pretty sure it would end up in the lost and found bin. Oh, come on, Winterfest is just two days away, we got a lot to do. Morning. Morning. I'm gonna finish the last batch of peanut brittle. How was your date? Oh, I really wouldn't call it a date, just a couple of friends getting together, having pizza and catching up. Erin's an executive head hunter. I would like to think that I've left that world behind. Oh, well, good for her and good for you. Yeah. She's a good person and a good friend, but not what I'm looking for. What are you looking for? It's funny I was thinking... thinking about this the other day. I... I think... I was thinking I'd like a... like a best friend. You know somebody who challenges me, but also, you know, who has my back. Who's genuine, but you know, genuinely cares about me, you know? I agree. That is the least of what you deserve. Okay. Well... What, uh... What do you mean? Well, I'm just saying um... that you deserve someone who sees that underneath that often bossy, take charge, sometimes socially tone deaf, successful suit exterior, is a really decent guy. Thank you. That's nice, thank you. You're welcome. Oh, hi, welcome to Murphy's. - Hi! - What can I get for you? I'm off to the senior pavilion. - Need any help? - Oh, no. I shouldn't be that long. Um... Also, Brooks will be by after lunch. Okay, sounds good. I've got everything covered here. I can see that, that is amazing. - Thanks. - You're so talented. See you later. This... will look like nice on your door until next spring, at least. This is for my new friend, Eileen. Okay. Isn't tomorrow the big Winterfest? Yeah, yeah it is. Oh, that reminds me. I brought you your favourite candy. - Rocky Road fudge? - What? Since when that's your favourite? I got you toffee. Oh. Well... I'm just testing. Toffee is my favourite. Come on. Yeah. Hey, how's that all coming along with your new business partner? Great, she's feisty. She's like a momma bear with a cub when it comes to her shop. She really speaks her mind. - Oh. - But she's also passionate about her craft, so... But then when she lets her guard down, she's... she's sweet. Pardon the pun. But she's fun, she's funny. Sounds like a perfect match for you. No, not like that, Dad. Just because you've been burned once doesn't mean you have to give it up altogether. Dad, we're business partners, that's it. Look, it seems to me, Son, that if you share the same values and goals and outlooks and you know how to comprise, well, you've got most of the ingredients to have a successful relationship. I had a big offer, the kind you don't refuse, come across my desk. And? Uh... well, I'm thinking it over. I told them I needed some time. Although I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted. But also I don't really miss that... shark and piranha filled world. And I made a commitment to Jake and Kerrie, so... The only important question is are you happy here? Yeah, I am. That's all that matters. Brooks? Kerrie, hi. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Ah... oh. This is my dad, Joel. Everybody calls me Papa Joel. Well, it is very nice to meet you, Papa Joel. I see where Brooks gets his sparkling eyes. And his sweet tooth. Well, it sure is nice meeting you. I've heard a lot about you. Oh no, if you've heard it from him, it's probably not true. Oh, I like her. Well, he doesn't say that about very many people. Well, I'm honoured. Um... what are you doing here? Are you, uh... you're making deliveries for Winterfest? Uh... well, you know, you would probably consider this a bimonthly tax deductible, charitable donation, but I like to call it, "Never showing up empty-handed when you're visiting friends." Oh, Martha! That is a beautiful wreath. I have your favourite candy, you're gonna love this. Well... Oh, making these winter wreaths just wears me out, I'm gonna take a nap. Oh, yeah, Dad, it's real strenuous. And uh... I think... that you should just go over there and help that pretty business partner of yours. - That's real subtle, Dad. - I'll see you later, alright? Alright, enjoy, you guys. - Hey. - Hi. Do you need any help? Sure, um... would you mind giving this to Jack? He's over there. He has allergies, so I make this special for him. What? Nothing, just... You continue to surprise me. Oh, well, I could say the same about you. Thank you for helping me. Oh and for not lecturing me about all the product I'm giving away. I would never do that. I mean, look how happy you're making everybody here, it's... Okay who are you and what have you done with my business partner? That's true, I have spent my whole life being obsessed with the bottom line, but I think now I'm realizing that... I don't know, there's more to life. Well, I suppose without a profit, there wouldn't be any product to give away, so... So you're saying that we make a good team? Yeah. Hey, listen, when you're done with this, there's something I want to show you, okay? Okay, yeah. Yeah, I found this place when I was out walking with my dad. Oh, it's really nice. Um... how come your dad lives here and not with you? Or is that too personal? No, no, not at all. Uh... he says it's because he doesn't like my cooking. He's just very independent and he also has a very active social life. I think it comes from years of living on a military base surrounded by people. Oh, that makes sense. I bet Papa Joel is popular with the ladies too. Well, he has friends but uh... he says that my mom was the love of his life, his soulmate, and the only one that's truly in his heart. - That's beautiful. - Yeah. I always wanted to have that kind of devotion to someone but... But you never live in one place long enough? Okay, I accept that. But now I've answered all your questions. Come here, I got some... Why did you shun me so much in high school? I didn't shun you in... Ugh. Okay. This is gonna sound really childish now, but you picked on me all the time, relentlessly. Well, yeah, of course, you're my best friend's very cute off limits little sister. Of course I picked on you. That... that was my job. You were also very arrogant. Okay. Yeah, I accept that. I think I was a new kid in a new school every other year since the time I was five years old so I just, I learned to go in strong. Otherwise I'd be eaten alive. Kids are vicious, especially in high school. So it was a facade, was it? Yeah, more than you know. Listen, I want to apologize. I didn't mean to pick on you. I never meant that meanly. I'm very sorry. And I want to ask you if there's anything else that I did during that time, because I would like to apologize for that too. Fine. When I was a sophomore and you were a senior... I was under the impression that you invited me to be your date to the Winter Snow Ball dance. What? I bought a dress, I did my hair and makeup and... I waited all night. You never showed. What I... I'm so sorry, Kerrie, I never knew that I gave you that impression. If I had known, I never would've of... I know. - I'm sorry, Bean. - Oh, that's another thing. I detested that nickname. Because of you in high school, I was called every variation a person could think of. Uh... Stinky Bean, Bossy Bean, Jelly Bean. Ugh, the list went on and on. Sorry. Listen, I would like you to consider forgiving me, and I would like to ask you if this could be a fresh start for us. What do you say? Okay, fresh start. You never did tell me why you moved back. Here? Oh I just... Yeah, fond memories of Bedford, and then I wanted to get out of the city and Jake called right at the right time, so... And also... What? It's nothing. It's okay. We should get going. Lots to do before the big day tomorrow. Okay, alright, let's go to it. - Okay. - Fresh start. Yes, fresh start. Oh, I remember when you and Jake planned the senior prank, and you bubble wrapped the hallways. I plead the fifth. Although I will say, whoever thought of that, absolute genius. Oh, it was funny. I also remember a very sweet sophomore gift to the entire senior class, their own personalized box of candy. Yes, well you almost didn't get one. My parents made me include you. This is kind of embarrassing, I never had a... I don't know how a cocoa bomb works. Oh, well, I'll show you. Take this, you put it right in there, and then you add some hot milk. Watch this. See that? And then it explodes and there are all the marshmallows! - Oh, that's cool! - Yeah, try it. Oh, thank you. It's amazing. You made all those? That's incredible. Oh, it's not that hard, I can teach you. Well, that is the last one. I think we're all set for tomorrow. Okay, well I have some financials to do so... I'll lock up, you guys can take off. Okay. Oh, well don't work too late, we have a big day tomorrow. Yes, ma'am. I'll go get my coat and my things. I haven't seen you smile like this in, I don't know when. Yeah, after my divorce, I just focused on raising Megan and running the shop. I didn't want another failed relationship. Maybe you didn't fail, maybe the marriage failed you. Maybe. I'm happy for you. Everyone deserves a second chance. Especially when it comes to love. Jake, what time is it there? And what are you eating? I was hungry for a midnight snack. It's almost one A.M. I couldn't sleep. Beans on toast. Funny with the beans. So, you all set for Winterfest tomorrow? Yes, the candy is all made and Brooks is gonna meet me early and help me set up the booth. Yeah, he mentioned that to me when I spoke to him earlier. Oh, you talked to him? Don't worry, he's gonna turn down Erin's business proposal. Wait, what business proposal? I thought he told you. Uh, apparently not. Do you care to fill me in? Jake, I'm waiting. There you go, happy Winterfest. You know, I'm feeling a little thirsty. Would you like a hot cider? - Mm, I'd love one. - Okay, I'll be right back. Hey. Uh, there you go. What's going on with Kerrie? - What do you mean? - I mean, is she okay? Oh, she's probably just stressed. This is the biggest day of the year for the shop. Right, right. Where'd she go? To get us a couple of hot ciders. Oh, do you want one? No, thanks, one's plenty for me. Oh right, okay. Bye. Two ciders, please. Hey! Hey. Busy day, huh? Oh, yeah, very busy. You're okay, right? You're not upset with me or anything? No, I just have to get back to the booth. Uh... can we talk later? Great. Hey, you. Oh, hey, Erin. Hi. I had a really fun time the other night. It was fun, connecting with old friends. - Yeah. - Not that you're old. That's not what I meant. I do, I do, I know what you mean. Not to sound cliché, but it's true, you know, what they say, old friends are the best. Absolutely, yeah. So, not to pressure you, but I need to know. Here you go. What's going on with you two? Nothing, what do you mean? Yesterday was all fireworks. Today, it's like the ice age. Oh, hi, Eileen, how are you? I have your order. I am fantastic and enjoying this wonderful festival. - How are you? - Oh, great. Winterfest is the best time of year. Are you alright, dear? Yeah, it's just been a tumultuous month and once again, things aren't certain. Nothing in life ever is, but I do believe that what's meant to be will always find a way. The client is really interested in meeting you. And between you and me, you are a shoo-in for the COO position. It would be a huge step up in the corporate world. But I need to know either way. Listen, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this offer. But uh... even though I might regret this in the future, I'm gonna turn down the opportunity. I'm very committed to this little shop. I understand. Alright, well you know where to find me if you change your mind. Oh! Sorry, little something in my throat. One second, I have your order. Megan! Surprise! Oh my goodness! You're supposed to be in Europe, what are you doing here? I got your email and I wanted to come surprise you. Uncle Jake helped me with the ticket. Oh, that was so nice of him. I have to fly back on Monday but... It doesn't matter, I'm so happy you're here. Oh, um... Megan, this is Brooks, my business partner. Brooks, this is my daughter, Megan. Hello, hello, I've heard so much about you. Yeah, same here. I've missed this. I haven't been home for Winterfest in years. Well, that is the nice thing about traditions. You can always come back to them. But I do worry about you, especially with Uncle Jake and Ophelia and me so far away. I'll be fine, I'll figure it out. Aren't you the one always telling me communication is the most important thing in any relationship? Well... things are a little more complicated with good ol' Brooks. Only if you let it be. When did you get so smart? I get it from my mom. Um, I see a couple of friends I want to say hi to. Oh, okay. Oh! And here's our raffle ticket. Let me know if we win anything. - You got it. - Alright, love you. Love you. Hi. I hope I didn't interrupt. No, she just wanted to say hi to some friends. Um... I'm told that it's a tradition here at Winterfest for partners to dance. Would you dance with me? If you don't tell me what the problem is, I don't know how to fix it. I just had my whole life turned upside down, so if you and the pretty head hunter are gonna leave me in a lurch, I'd rather know sooner than later. I knew it. No, wait, wait, wait. Let me explain. You asked why I bought Jake out, and I just didn't tell you everything. When I was in New York, I was engaged. And the relationship wasn't perfect, but I was dedicated to it, until I discovered that the woman that I was with, she wasn't the woman that she said she was at all. It was just... It was utterly humiliating to know that the person I trusted most in the world, she... she betrayed me, in more ways than one. And then the fallout professionally and personally, it just... Brooks, I'm so sorry, I had no idea. So that's why you left New York. I just started revaluating my life, my career choices, everything. And I decided that I wanted to make a clean break from that world. And that's... that's right when your brother called me. What about this new business opportunity with Erin? I said no. I don't want to go back into that world. Are you sure this is what you want? Yeah. That chapter in my life is closed. It's finished. And I'm very excited to be writing this new chapter with you, together. Thanks. Oh, Adam, hi. I didn't see you earlier. Oh, let me find your order. I finally managed to escape the restaurant. Ah, no, it's for you. As are these. They're beautiful. My favourites, how'd you know? I was hoping we could have dinner this week? It'd be nice letting someone else cook for once. I'd like that a lot. Well, I've got to get back to the eatery. I'm not complaining about being busy but... I understand. Thanks again for these. You're welcome. Hi, sorry. Um... I... I, um... I think we should probably get back to the booth. Sure. How's it going? Oh, good, better than ever. We thought you could use a break. Oh, thanks. Oh, do we have more chocolate peanut butter fudge? - We're all out. - Yes, I made a batch this morning, but it's back at the shop. I'll get it. I'll be right back. Thank you. You two looked pretty cozy out there on the dance floor. Oh, it's a Winterfest tradition, business partners have to dance at least once dance together. Mm-hmm. These are some nice flowers, where'd they come from? Uh-huh! David, give these to your grandmother, they are her favourite, thanks. - Kerrie. - Oh, Tim. - Do you have a minute? - Sure. I've been meaning to call you. I did a little digging and the paperwork was signed, it was just filed incorrectly. So, your loan has been approved, congratulations. Now you can buy out your obnoxious, controlling, egoist of a business partner. You're free. Congratulations. I acted impulsively because I was upset about something. I'm sorry, Tim, but I'm not gonna need that loan. Things with my new business partner are better than I could've ever dreamed. Again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Oh, no worries. I'm glad to hear it. Hey, why don't you come by the booth for some peanut butter chocolate fudge, on the house? I'll gladly take you up on that. Hey, Erin, it's Brooks, um... Hey, I had a bit of a change of heart. Um, I'm wondering if you could go ahead and set up that interview for me. Uh... call me back, let me know, thank you. Mom, you won! What? I never win anything. Well, you did this time. Open it. Oh. Are you kidding? Seriously? It's meant to be. Mom, a couple of my friends are getting together - at Izzy's house. Do you mind... - Oh, go have a good time, okay. - Thank you. - Love you. Love you too. See you, Alexandra. See you. Uh, did Brooks say when he would be coming back? He did, he just said he had some calls to return. Hi, I got you a coffee. - Oh, thanks. - Hey, have you seen Brooks? I looked for him after Winterfest last night, and he hasn't returned my messages. It's not like him. Yeah, I haven't seen him since he dropped off the fudge at the booth. You know what? I'm starting to worry. Maybe he just lost his phone. Yeah, well whatever, I hope he's okay. Oh, still no response. What's so urgent that you had to interrupt bingo? I was winning. You remember that big offer I told you about? What, the one you can't turn down? Yeah, that's the one. And the main campus is in California, so get your surfboard ready. Oh, I... I thought things were going pretty well. You and Kerrie seemed to be hitting it off, am I wrong? Uh, no, no, I was. What? I thought you wanted to move to the Golden state. Well, I kind of like living in the Buckeye state. Come on, what happened? I don't know, Dad. Just uh... wrong about a woman again. Anyway, listen, if you want to stay here, there's offices in Cincinnati that I can work out of. I'll make sure everything's taken care of, whatever you want. No, no, I go where you go. I've had a great life. Your happiness, that's what matters to me. Okay, thanks. I love you, Dad. You don't look very happy. Matter of fact, you look downright miserable. - You wanna talk about it? - No, no, not really, no. You got to remember that Kerrie isn't Sierra. I gotta go to Cincinnati, sign these papers. I'll be back in a few hours. Let me know, I'll be ready to go. - Jake, hey. - So, how was Winterfest? We nearly doubled what we made last year. I told you Brooks was a financial genius. And how are things going with him? Good, great, we sorted out the job thing, and now everything's perfect. I had a feeling you two would hit it off. Yeah, I just don't know where he is right now. Any sign of Brooks? No, he's never been this late before. Okay, that's it. Something is not right. Where are you going? Well, I'll tell you where I'm going. I am going to break out of my fortress and get some answers, no matter what they might be. - That's where I'm going. - Yes, girl. Papa Joel. Kerrie, what a nice surprise, what brings you here? Oh, I thought everyone might need a break from all that candy. Is Brooks here? Um, no, sorry. Papa Joel, do you have a minute? For you? Absolutely, sit down. Thank you. Oh, I'm gonna miss these snowy winter days. Oh, well, not to worry, you still have a few more months of snowy weather. Not where I'm moving. You're moving? Yeah, didn't Brooks mention anything to you? No, he did not. Well, I don't think it's my place to... He's in Cincinnati at a business meeting, and if all goes well, we'll be relocating to California. And by the sounds of it, pretty soon too. I don't understand. Look, I don't know what happened between you two. But there's one thing I do know. When you get to my age, well, you won't regret the chances you took for love. Only the ones you let pass you by. Do you know when he'll be back? Late afternoon. Thank you. Oh, and... Please don't tell him we talked. Oh, I won't. Kerrie. I want you to know... I'm rooting for you. Me too. The only thing that's missing from this is your signature. Now if you don't like the California campus, you can always come back to Cincinnati and work from here. No, no, my dad's stoked for the sun and surf. I don't blame him. You're lucky to have him. I am. I worked so hard my whole life. I sacrificed nearly everything to be successful. I think you and I are two of a kind. These are from a client, have one. Thank you. What should I do with this, regift it? It's starting to grow on me. Oh, excuse me. Murphy Candy and Gifts. Hi. How did you find me? Papa Joel. Oh, yeah, should've guessed. - Can we talk? - No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry that this didn't work out, but I will sign any papers that you have. Brooks, what are you talking about? I'm talking about the loan documents. Unfortunately for you, I overheard you talking to the bank manager. So please don't worry. I'm not gonna cause any problems. Brooks, is that what you thought? That I would confront you about leaving me in the lurch and I'd go behind your back and get a secret loan to buy you out of the business? I told Tim I don't want the loan. I had him cancel it. Yeah, yes, at first, I did want it, but... that was before I got to know you. I had the contract in my hand... and I couldn't sign it. - You didn't sign it? - No. Why not? It's because this restlessness that has driven me my whole life from place to place... is not here anymore. It's gone. Since I met you. I guess I'm changing. Well, life is for the living, but... he who is living must be prepared for changes. Is that my high school yearbook quote? What about you, why didn't you take the loan? What changed your mind? Well, I might have fallen in love with you. You might have? I have fallen in love with you. And it's wonderful and terrifying, because you know how I feel about change. But I had to come and find you and tell you, and honestly, if you don't feel the same way it's... - I like it. - Me too. I got something for you. What? It's a surprise. Two tickets to Belgium? That's right. We're gonna go back to the very little village that your great-grandparents learned to make candy, and then we're gonna see Jake and Ophelia, and of course, we'll see Megan. I love you, Brooks McLead. I love you too, Bean. Subtitling: difuze
