I don't wanna be late for the party. Just a couple minutes. I got an idea of what we could do while we're waiting. Oh yeah, what's that? Butt stuff. What? Kissing, I thought we could just kiss. Classic American kissing. I should call my sister and tell her I'm gonna be late. Sure. Yeah, do that. Family first. Then teamwork. Hey. No, we're on our way. No. Jay's car overheated, so we're just waiting for it to cool down. No, I'm fine. I am fine, trust me. No, he's not. Mandy. Trust me. Okay, I'll see. Mandy, please don't tell Mom because, you know, the way she gets. Everything okay? Yeah. How's the car? Probably just got another couple of minutes. Hey, I stole some Halloween candy from some kids in my neighborhood. You want a piece? Yeah, actually, I do. Ah. What? What do you say? Trick-or-treat? There you go, go for it. I can't feel anything. You got it, just pull on it! Pull on it! - Please. - I'm trying, it's stuck. Just keep pulling on it. Keep grabbing. It's like a Toostie Roll. It's a full-size candy bar. What? What happened? What? You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Where you going? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You don't have to go, it was just a joke. You're fucking disgusting. It was a joke! What're you doing? Jay, just fuck off. You're just gonna walk home? I'll find a ride, just go. Sara, it was just a joke. I'll find a ride, just go, just go. You know, it's going to be hard for you to find a ride when you don't have this. Give me that. Give me that. You want this? Give me the phone. - Give me the phone. - Ooooooh. Have fun walking, bitch. Jay! Jay! Asshole. Fuck! Oh, shit! Hello? I just need to use your phone. Can somebody help me, I just need, I just need to use the phone. Hello? Hello? Is anyone in here? Hello? Hello? Hello? Sara. Jay? Jay! Trick 'r treat. It's another beautiful October day here in Yost Town. Halloween's right around the corner, folks. I'll be in Inebriate City for the two for ones and don't forget, the girls with the sluttiest costumes get in free and drink till they pass out. I'm your man, DJ Dick, "from 105.6 The Mix," putting hits all up in your mouth. Have you ever killed anything? What? Like, when you were younger. Every kill a bird, cat or anything? I killed a pet fish by overfeeding it once. Have you ever just wanted to just kill someone? I don't know, maybe. Hey, what's up with you and Ricky anyway? Did you fuck him yet? Jesus, Mandy. What? Don't tell me you haven't fucked him yet. Maybe. Whatever, Melissa. At least given a handy? You're such a slut. Oh wait, look. There she is. Who? Old Aunt Ethel. Why do they call her "Old Aunt Ethel?" Because, like 20 years ago, she killed her entire family in that house and all the neighbors could hear someone inside yelling, "Stop, Aunt Ethel! "Please, God, stop, Aunt Ethel!" Hey! Jesus, Mark. You scared the shit out of me. What're you scared of? I haven't even pulled it out yet. Ew. Gross. Guys! I love this girl. Oh. Just telling Melissa, here, the story of Old Aunt Ethel. Oh yeah, it's almost Halloween, huh? What does that mean? So Old Aint Ethel, every year on Halloween, she lures the kids inside. Says she has very special candy, candy that's gonna make all their wishes come true. And when she gets them inside, she slaughters them, sawing off their limbs, one by one. Yeah right. No, it's true. Then why isn't she in jail yet? Because if you don't have a body, you don't have a crime. What does that mean? They say that Old Aunt Ethel, she turns all the kids' body parts in Halloween treats, leaving behind no remains at all. That's one psychotic bitch. You definitely don't wanna go trick-or-treating at her place. She'll turn you into pumpkin pie. 11, 12 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 11 more to go. Hello. Hey, girl, what you doin'? You know, just "twerking the fleek," right? What? I don't know. You going to Mandy's party tonight? I don't know yet. I still have a lot of studying and stuff to do. Bitch, you better. You on the rag or something? What? No! Mmmmm. You got that heavy flow. Girl, just double up. Double up? Yeah, girl, just stick two super heavy flows right up in that bitch and you could party for four hours straight. No leakage. Ha. What, no, I'm not on my period. I just don't know if I'm gonna go yet. Girl, you gotta live a little. This is not Ohio or wherever the fuck you from. We party hard out here, okay, hoe? Okay. Hey, do you know about all that "Old Aunt Ethel" stuff? Yeah, girl, everybody has heard about Old Aunt Ethel. I mean, is it true that she takes all the kids on Halloween night and stuff? Bitch, you worry about the wrong things, okay? Get your shit together, we partying hard tonight. Okay, hoe. Ah. Let's see. What do I need? Bop! Ah! Ah, yes, I need you. Yeah! Ah, I love that. Woo. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Look at that. Oh, I'm getting excited! I'm getting excited! Ricky! Get the fuck out of here! Oh! Sorry. And now! Time for my famous pickled chocolates. Mmmm, it already smells good. Oh, the heel. The heel and the balls. The balls of the feet are the best. Mmmm-mmmm, I can almost taste 'em. I can almost taste 'em. I love it. Everybody loves them. I'll eat 'em, that's for damn sure. Yes, sir. Perfect. Perfect. All right, now, let's get these in the oven. Ah, yes. Of course. With this soul, another day will come. 100! Yeah, bitches! Aren't you with Melissa? What? No, I ditched that bitch. No fucking way. Hey, what's up, bitch? Are you seeing this? Ew, what a dick. Just come on, fuck him. Melissa, wait! I just can't believe he would do this to me. Fuck him, Melissa. Who cares? I care! Well, what did you expect? What does that mean? You haven't even given him a handy. Great, thanks. Nice pep talk. Melissa, can we please talk? She doesn't want to talk to you, Ricky. Melissa, please, just give me a chance to explain. Come on. There's nothing to explain. I can handle this. Fine, go ahead, I was just trying to help. I really don't care about what you have to say, Ricky. It's all bullshit anyways. Just leave me alone. Yeah, fuck off, Ricky. Leave me alone, Ricky. It's me, Mark. Well, is Ricky there with you? No, he left, like, a long time ago. Are you kidding me? Whatever, fuck him. Let's party. Dr. Dick in the house. I think I wanna go home. Come on, Mel. I'm really not in the mood to party. Come on, don't let him get in the way of you living your life, Melissa. It's not just him. I was up late last night studying, I'm tired. I'm just gonna go. I'll walk with you. Fuck, seriously? You don't have to do that, Mandy, I'm fine. She's fine, babe. Mark, shut up. This is girl code. You don't fucking get it. You're right, I don't fucking get it. And don't make me pull a "Ricky" on you too. Really, Mark? Too soon? Fuck you. Eh. I'll tell you what, Mark. You go ahead and pull a "Ricky" on me but you better make it worth your while because it'll be the last time you stick that little pee-pee in a vagina ever again, got it? Got it. Now you're gonna get it. Seriously? Jesus. You need to get over him, ASAP, seriously. I wasn't gonna say anything but I fucked him last year and he was, like, the quickest cummer ever. It was pitiful. Mandy, are you serious? What? It was last year before you guys even met. And you weren't gonna tell me? I did just tell you. Jesus, Mandy. Whatevs. My point is you need to get over him. He's a waste of time. Seems like everything's a waste of time nowadays. Oh, look. There's Aunt Ethel. Come on, let's go look. No. Come on. Seriously? Well, wait up. She looks like a regular old lady baking a cake to me. It may seem that way but I assure you it's not. She's probably boiling someone's skull right now. Oh, come on. Yes, sir. This is ridiculous. Why are we creeping around some poor old lady? Poor old lady? Yeah right. I'm going home. This is stupid. Mmmm-mmmm. Yes, sir. Mmmmmm. Oh, it's delicious. Mmmmm. Put that back in there. Yes, sir. Shit. Hey! What're you doing there? You trick-or-treating? Trick-or-treat. Well, Halloween ain't for a couple days. You're early.

Raised on the streets, son. Don't get clapped up. You know what, fuck you. What was that? I said, fuck you. Prove it. Just get out. You are one crazy bitch. So, what did you have to tell me? Oh, right. Okay, so last night I couldn't sleep, so I ended up going on this walk. It was like 2AM or something and I ended up going past Old Aunt Ethel's house and I went up and looked in her window and she caught me. See saw you? Yeah, she asked if I was like trick-or-treating or something. Are you kidding me? Uh uh, and then she asked if I wanted any of her pickled chocolates. You didn't eat any, did you? No. Why? Because those are chocolate-covered body parts. Oh, yeah right. I'm serious, everyone knows about her picked chocolates. What are you looking for? My fucking weed. I bet my mom took it again. Mom, did you take my fucking weed again?! Fucking bitch! For the last time, Mandy, I did not take your weed! Yes you did, you stole my fucking weed! Fucking bitch! I hate that bitch! Hello. Hi. Hi.

You're totally fucking with me. No, it's true. Did you tell her our plan yet? No, okay, so listen. Tomorrow night is Halloween, right? So we're gonna have a stakeout at Aunt Ethel's house.

Okay, here we go. See? I told you! I fucking told you! He could come back out. Oh no, they never come back out. He's been in there for like 10 minutes now. Look. Look, another kid. Trick or treat.

Listen, I didn't tell you everything about tonight but now you see why we have to do this. Do what? Mandy, what are you talking about? We're going to kill Old Aunt Ethel. I'm gonna blow her fucking head off. Calm down, Mark. You guys are crazy, you can't kill her. Why? She's killing poor, innocent children, Melissa. How can you let that happen? We have to call the police. Those kids will be fucking dead before those cops ever get here with a search warrant. I'm gonna blow her fucking head off. I can't do this, I can't fucking kill her. Look, there's a kid at the door. Trick or treat. That's my nephew, Gio! Gio! You can't go running up there, screaming like that. You'll never see him again. Let go of me. Listen to me. Look at me, you dumb bitch! There's a right way to do this, okay? We're gonna save your nephew, I promise, but not like this. I need you to calm down and trust me. So, look at "Miss Toughy Pants" now, huh? Just a second ago you didn't want anything to do with this. Now look at you. It's different, Mandy, she has my nephew. It's always someone's nephew, someone's brother. Someone's sister. It's funny how everything changes when it's your own family, isn't it? Well, I know exactly how it feels, Melissa. Aunt Ethel took a sister from me. She took my brother from me. Guys, I didn't know. I'm so sorry. You ready to kill this fucking bitch? I'm ready to kill this bitch. Let's kill this bitch. Gio. You can't cause a seen by letting him see you. If he starts screaming and yelling, Aunt Ethel's gonna come out here and we're gonna lose out chance to end this once and for all. We're going to save him, okay? Come on. All right, all you have to do is wait for me to get inside. Okay? Then you're gonna knock on the front door and distract Aunt Ethel. She's gonna think it's trick-or-treaters. When she opens the door, bang, I blow her fucking head off. You guys okay? Hey. I got this. Just trust me. I love you. What are you girls doing there?! Nothing. Hey, you're that girl from the other night. And you brought a friend with you? Yeah. Trick-or-treat. Well, I'm so glad you came back. I have some delicious treats inside. Come with me. Mmmm. Sit. Sit. So, where are your costumes? I'm dressed as her and she's dressed as me. Yeah. We were trying to be funny. Not impressed. Mmmmm. Mmmmm-mmmmm. Care for some of my famous homemade pickled chocolates? No, thank you. We've already eaten so much candy tonight. Well don't look disgusted. They're delicious. Mmmmm. Hey! Hey! Oh my God. Dude, we're fucked. I can never get enough of 'em. Oh man. Mmmmm, mmmmmm, mmmm, mmmmm. Hey! Hey, what the fuck?! I can never get enough of 'em. They are so good. I make 'em myself, you know. Homemade. Can I use your bathroom, please? Yeah. Sure, it's in the back, there. Come with me, Melissa. I'm gonna go with her, if that's okay? Mmhmmm. What are we gonna do? I don't know, I don't know. Let's just climb out this window. No, we can't leave without Gio. Right, okay. Think, think, think. Look for anything we can use as a weapon. Okay. Did you find anything yet? Not unless we can use a toothbrush or a toilet brush. You girls all right in there? Yeah, we'll be right out. Well, you have some company here. Company? Yes, your friend is here to see you. Okay, okay! Sit, sit, sit. He wants it to be a surprise. Yes, he wants it to be a surprise! Stay right there and I'll be right back. Look who's here to save you. Isn't that sweet? Awwwww. "Hey, "look at me. "I'm the coolest kid in school "and I'm here to save you." He's here to save you. Mark? Oh, right. So, listen, I slit this throat. He's only got about 15 seconds to live. So, little girls, you got anything you wanna say? Mark, I'm so sorry. You know what? Yep. I was wrong. He's dead. He didn't hear a word you said. Fucking bitch! You're fucking dead! No so fast, sunshine. Does this look familiar? Your little friend here said I could have it. I've never had a gun before. I can't wait to try it out. You having fun, buddy? Yeah. Hey, let's check out the next house. Hey, hey! Calm the hell down, buttercup, unless you want me to lay you down beside her. Is that what you want? No, no. Well then get a hold of yourself. Get up. Come on, get over here. Get up and get your ass over here. Push your little friend here out of the chair and sit down in it. What? Oh, is this too hard? Push him out of the chair and sit down in it. Oh. Would you put some muscle into it? Oh, for Lord's sakes, let me. Now, was that too hard? Now sit down! What are you going to do? Little poor baby. Listen, don't take it too personal. You're taking it too hard. Please don't do this. "Please don't. "Please don't." There is good news. I need to deliver 31 souls. You get to end it because you're number 31. What do you mean? Do you believe in witches? No. How about curses and evil spells? No. Well you should. On this very day, 40 years ago, a witch put a curse on me. I need to deliver 31 souls for every day that dead walk. And you, little bunny, make 31. If I make 31, then Gio's 32. You don't have to kill Gio. Who? There's a little boy in your barn. His name is Gio and he's my nephew. If I'm 31 then he's 32 and you don't have to kill him. Please, just take me and let him go. Yeah, sure. Wait, wait, wait, wait. How will I know you'll let him go if I'm dead? You'll just have to trust me. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Jesus Christ, just wait a second! Oh, come on! I'm dying to use this thing again. Please, there must be another way. Trick or treat. Okay, it's done. There's your 31st soul. Can we go home now, please? I forgot to mention one little thing. What? What, are you going to let us go? Oh, you can go. Then why are you laughing? The only way my curse could ever be broken is if someone else offered to take the 31st soul for me. What? You took the 31st soul for the dead. What does that mean? Well that means that you are the cursed one now. No. No. Aaah! In 31 hours or less, you will receive a message. It will tell you everything you need to know.
