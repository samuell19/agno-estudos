Ren? at 11 years of age. Get up, lazy bastard! Stop it, Daddy, stop it! I'll teach you your place, you bastards! - Everything'll be alright. - I've had enough. You're going to school this afternoon. Dad won't be back until tonight. He treats me like a dog. He's been like that since Mum died. - It'll work out in the end. - It'll never work out ever! Go to sleep. I'll wake you up by noon. See you later. Shame we won't see each other again. Alfred at 12 years of age. But... Are you crazy? What's come over you? - Don't you like it? - You're nuts. - Do you love me, darling? - Yes. Please! - I said no. - Why? - Because I don't feel like it today. - Please! What are you doing here? My parents are dead. I don't want to go to an orphanage. You and I, we have things in common. Who's talking about orphanage? et me introduce myself: Ren?. If you want to start a new life, discover new things, come with me. Yves at 4 years of age. We'll have to send that kid to school. Go and play outside, little punk. One can't have 5 minutes' peace in this fucking house! Fed up! You're right, for once. He wouldn't bother us so much if he went to school. For today's lesson, I'll just ask you to take a few notes. JoÃ«lle, open the door, please. Yves at 13 years of age. I'm bringing you a new pupil. His name is Yves. That's all he's told me so far. A little bit shy, I think. You're starting the year a bit late as you've just arrived here. But don't worry, I'll help you, and your friends, too. Everything will be alright. This is Yves. I hope you'll all be nice to him as he's just arrived here with his parents. He'll need some good friends. Here. Go and sit next to George. School, school, I wonder why. He doesn't need school. School, what a damn thing... Stop moaning, idiot, he doesn't need to be as stupid as you. That's what he needs to learn. Man's only predator, particularly in India, is the man-eating tiger. One can say it is the only animal that hunts man, to protect himself or his female and her offspring. Yves, what are you doing? - Put that knife away. - I don't agree with you. - You don't agree with what? - Not only the tiger eats man. - Please, make your point. - Men do it, too. Yes, cannibals. But they don't exist anymore. - Not true! - Calm down and give me that knife. Knives are not allowed. You're okay, sir? Already here? So, how was school? - Very good. I know I'm your son now. - Why now? I've killed my teacher and the headmaster. What? Are you nuts? What came over you? Ren?, I told you we shouldn't send him to school. You've brought me up. Taught me things and now you're telling me off. True. I can't blame you for it. It's your fault. You souldn't have sent Yves to school. He belongs here. You don't learn anything useful at school. Now they'll find us thanks to your stupidity. - We can always run away from here. - Run away? Where to? We already ran away over 6 years ago. And nobody has ever found us. And you have to be stupid enough to send Yves to school. - Don't worry. The mountains are big. - Will you stop talking nonsense? From now on, let's be cautious. Many people have disappeared around here. The longer it goes on, the more we're in danger. - It won't stop us from eating. - Talking of which, I'm hungry. I'll be back. Damn Alfred. Good riddance. I never ran so fast. Nor me. My morning jogging is less than half an hour. Tell me when you want to stop. I feel okay now, but maybe I'll drop dead in 5 minutes. Carry on without me. Come on, one more effort. I'll have something to tell at work when I get back. - Oh yeah, what? - He tortured me during the whole holiday. - Shall we carry on? - Okay. It's weird. I feel as if someone is watching us. I am not surprised. You're so pretty, one cannot stop staring at you. It hurts! - Okay? Nothing broken? - I don't know. - I'll take your shoe off. - It hurts. You want to get up. You won't be able to walk back to the village. And carrying you all the way is impossible. Go and get some help, but hurry up. - It hurts! - Okay, I'll go. Don't worry, I won't be long. It hurts! Sorry. Did I frighten you? Have you got a prolem? - Can I help you? - No, thank you. I strained my ankle but my friend has gone to get some help. - He won't be long. - Shall I stay until he comes back? No, that's not necessary. That's quite a bad strain. - Do you think it's broken? - Surely not. I hope my friend will come back soon. The village is very far away. I'll stay with you until he comes back. - What are you doing here? - I live very near. Really? In these mountains? For more than 10 years now. Before, I lived in the city. Why did you reject our society? I didn't reject it. I'm looking for the criminals who savagely murdered my younger brother, his wife and their baby more than six years ago. They'd be in the mountains. In the last 10 years, many people have disappeared. Didn't the police look for these freaks? They did, but all they found was an abandonned hut and the remains of the bodies. How dreadful! So, your brother died. Forgive me. I am really sorry. That's nothing. It doesn't bother me to have talked to you. Maybe I shouldn't have. Did I frighten you? These people are evil. They're the incarnation of evil. I must absolutely find them and eliminate them. So that they don't ever do it again. That forest frightens me now. It looked so welcoming a while ago. I am glad not to be alone. Here he is! It must be Fr?d?ric. Help! Mister, come, quick! Why are you screaming, little lady? I am sorry, but you scared me. Where is the man who was with me? He's gone to... ...another world. I don't understand what you're saying. Who are you? A nasty man who is going to bust your arse. eave me alone! Help! I am one of those nasty men who've wandered around these mountains... for more than 5 years. Do you see what I mean, bitch? You've got bad luck. I don't like you. You! You'll taste better than the other bitch! I need help. My friend strained her ankle in the mountains. She can't walk anymore. Go to the garage. They'll be men to help you over there. - Where? - Straight down the main road. Right there. I am looking for some help. My friend strained her ankle and she can't walk anymore. - Up there? - Just over there. - Is it far? - Yes, we ran quite some way. Give me 5 minutes. Food! It's a tough one. It'll be nice. Arthur, you know what to do. You cut him up and prepare us a little meal we won't forget for a long time. et's go. I found some people. You'll enjoy that. Fucking brain. It's shaking about. It turns you on. Here you are. It's ready. It's so fucking nice. The bastard is better in our stomach. It's good to eat some fresh flesh. We should follow our goal: that of creating evil. Satan can save us a seat next to him. I'll follow my mission like you do. - I'll make everybody I meet suffer. - That's good, my boy. I don't understand. She was just here. Try to call her. Anne, where are you? Here! Here you are. It's a madman. He tried to rape me. He killed a man who was with me. He was so nice. Calm down. I don't understand anything you say. Come and see. I know what she's talking about. Shit! - It leads somewhere. - Do you know the one who did this? It must be these madmen of the mountains. The three psychos. - It must be. - He was on his own. It doesn't mean anything. The others shouldn't be far. Poor man. He was looking for them for such a long time. He was so nice. It's been going on for too long. et's get some men and look for them. All this violence must stop. Here, drink some. I've come to get support. They're too close to the village. et's find them and deal with them. - I'm coming. - I'll get my gun. - No, stay here. - There are no more men in the village. They're all at work. But we shouldn't waste time. Stay here. It's none of our business. Don't worry, I'm not alone. Don't go. You'll see, sister. If we meet the cannibals, we'll cook them. We should be careful. They're smart and they know the mountain well. What's happening, Simone? Jacques went looking for the psychos who live in the mountains. What for? The madmen killed a man again and tried to rape a woman. It's dreadful. Jacques and my son went off to kill them. Don't move, I'll tell the priest. Why can't I come along when you go hunting? - Because you're too young. - He was too young. But since he went to school, he's become big enough. Next time, you'll come along. You'll see how good it is to see blood flow. I gives me a hard on when I see blood flow. Evil needs that blood. We need to feed Satan. Tomorrow, we'll escort you near the village. - And you'll pick your victim. - What kind of victim shall I pick? - Whichever one you want. - A boy my age? I'll drain all the blood from his body. My first victim will be... dedicated to Satan. Calm down and explain to me what's happening. The men of the village went looking for the psychos. The women are scared. - You stay since you're wounded. - No way. We talked, and we're coming. But you can't walk! Don't worry. If her ankle isn't better by tomorrow, we'll go home. et's stop talking, we're wasting time. Now that you've told me everything, calm down, Verdoux. Alright. Not the first time they go looking for them. They never saw them and always came back. God protects them. But this time, they don't just want to put them in jail. They want to get rid of them. - They've got a gun. - Killing won't change anything. Arresting these men is a good thing, but killing is the worst thing. I need to deal with it. - What will you do? - Find these men before them. Don't do that. They are evil beings. They'll kill you. - All you need is faith. - I'll come with you. No, I don't want any violence. I want to convince these men that they're wrong. With God's help. It's daylight! Get up! - We go hunting. - Why are you waking us up? What's up? We should get up. We go for my first hunt. You're crazy? With all that we ate yesterday. et me digest in peace. - We'll go tomorrow. - Fuck! I'll go for a little walk, it'll help my digestion. - I want to come along. - No, not now. Thank you, ord! The bastards are hiding well! et's just hope they haven't spotted us yet. Most of the missing ones were like us, they had enough of these madmen. And those people were never seen again? One of my friends went looking for them. He wanted them alive, he said. - But... why did he go alone? - His 11 years old daughter went missing. He thought it was those three who did it. And did they? The police found the girl in a ditch. She had been raped. The criminal was found a month later. It's the priest. - What are you doing here? - I was trying to find you. Without God's help, I wouldn't have. You're coming with us? I wanted to tell you that you can't fight evil with evil. Go back to the village. I'll carry on alone. Strength never did anything against evil. But God can. If He wants to, He'll guide me. No, we're not going back. But if you want, we'll come with you. You'll guide us. With God's help? If you want. But if you get in trouble, we'll help. Violence always! What a herd of fresh meat! And there's even a priest. I never tasted one before. Guys... take your tools. I spotted a herd, including a priest. I think they're looking for us. They're near. We'll take them by surprise. We won't need to go down to the village for food. You stay here. It's too dangerous for you. I hate you. But... it's me. So, I was born in Paris. If we find their hut, we'll attack at night. If we take them by surprise, we'll stand a better chance. I'll leave you here. I don't want to carry on with you. I've got to go alone. Good luck. Good luck, priest. Fuck! I'll burst! But, they are evil beings! They've been sent by Satan. He must have followed us for a while. You're just cowards! Morons, that's all you are! - I don't need you anymore. - You're nuts. Shut up or I bust your fucking face. She's losing her mind. Fr?d?ric! I love you! Is there somebody? Do you need help? My child, what's happening? You're in such a state! eave me alone! - I've got to find them. - What happened? - Where are the others? - Fr?d?ric is dead. The three madmen murdered him. Where is Jacques? - The moron didn't get lost. - The three madmen must have got him. Shit, let's go, night's coming. - Are they all here? - They all behaved. They've been well brought up. All this makes me feel like dancing. Stop it! Bastard! You can't do that! But I like your friend, you know. And if he were still alive, I'd bust his arsehole. I would never have imagined that people like you existed. I'd rather be in hell. But you are in hell. It makes no difference being in hell. You have a hard on, you ejaculate eternally. Eternal sexual sin. - It looks beautiful to me. - You didn't see everything. I haven't finished my slow dance. Move to the left, move to the right. I've had enough dancing. He lacks motivation. The living ones are more interesting. What you're going to do to him? eave me alone! You can't do that! - Special permission from Satan. - You're a scumbag! You were being smart with your friends. You wanted to destroy us. You'll pay for it! I can't believe it! I am going mad! We'll humiliate you in front of Satan. Destroy your bodies. Make a bodily break. We're going to crack your soul. You'll feel yourself go. I'm a fingernail expert. Your turn now. I must have gone mad. It's a nightmare. - I want to have fun, too. - You will when you go hunting. ook how beautiful he is now! Enough for today. I'm exhausted. Do what you want, I'm going to bed. et's go to bed, we'll tidy up tomorrow. My son... I'm proud of you. You're youth. You're beauty. Softness and innocence. I love you like one loves a tulip opening up on a spring morning. I love you for your beauty. And I will protect you whatever happens. Your body turns me on. Satan, I don't know who you are nor where you are but my father talks about you. So help me. What shall I do? You are evil. I must obey you. Spill blood. Although I have doubts about you. When you have to face good, maybe you'll lose. Help me. Prove to me that you're the strongest. Thank you! Early risers, you two! Today, I'm going on my first hunt, I'm sure. It's my day. You're a lazy bunch. Only men who sleep a lot become strong. - Stop talking rot. - You always want to be right. It's tiring to hear such bullshit when you've just got up. And who's dealing with everything here? It's me. And I am the only one who knows how to fuck. I'll learn. I don't worry about you. Think carefuly. The first hunt is very important. Pick your weapon. I pick the chain. So I can capture my victim without hurting it. Then I can play here with it. You decide. I'm proud of you. You'll become a man. I'll accomplish my mission like you. - Good thing you knew a shortcut. - I know the mountain better than anyone. If we'd gone through the little valley, it would have taken us 4 hours. This way, less than an hour. Bye, darling. Thank you for walking with me. - Be careful. - Don't worry, I know the way. Shit. Are you nuts? If you say one word, I split you open from the neck down to your arse. - Is that clear? - Alright. Don't panick. What do you want? - If you follow me, you'll be alright. - Okay. Mission accomplished? What do you want? I'll be late for school. - We want your blood and your innocence. - What? Never mind. We have to create evil. ittle punk, will you wake up? Where am I? Who are you? - We're angels. - Help! Shut up, you brat. eave my son alone! Hey! What is she doing here? First lesson: No witness when you pick your victim. - If it's the case, eliminate it. - It was crazy to come here. We have to create evil! Create evil! Go on, show her what you can do. Spill her blood. - Make him suffer as much as possible. - Wait. I'm going to help you. - Leave me alone! - You'll pay for all those who don't like us. - You'll suffer for them. - You'll feel pain. No! eave my son alone! Go and give your mum a kiss. - Wait for us. - See you at the hill. - What a moron. - I won't run. - Where are you going? - I have to deserve my body. Come and get me if you're a man. You've asked for it. Stop it! You're cute, you know? Isn't it funny? A few minutes ago, I almost looked like you. What? Nothing. What are you doing here, girl? I had an argument with my boyfriend. He is jealous. He is such a spoilsport. He cannot stand my looking at another boy. He makes a big thing of it. And you, what are you doing here? I'm wandering. Tell me... Are you not afraid all alone round here? No, why should I be? Because of the three psychos. It's nonsense. Nonsense. Just rumours. You don't believe it? I am not very fearful. et them come, these three psychos. These ugly men. I'll tickle their toes. Go for it now! Scratch my toes! So you're one of them. So, it's not a psychosis. It's not a legend. No, I don't think so. It is reality. And reality is going to let rip on you. isten to me. There are lots of things to do. There are lots of exciting things to do. Did you know? Oh yes, lots of things. So, you see...? Aren't you a little bit sadomasochistic? Sadistic, I don't know. Masochistic, I think so. Anyway, that's what the rumour says. And what are you suggesting? First, I'd like you to shut your mouth! If you think I'm going to dip my brush in your crater, you've got it all wrong. I fucked like a dog today. I'm satisfied. At least from that point of view. Untie me now! But... there isn't just sex in life. - What else is there? - I'll show you. Homosexuality: A sexual attraction to members of the same sex. Immoral, shame, suffering. Paedophilia: The condition of being sexually attracted to children. A major crime. Immoral, murder, decadence. Fellatio, sodomy, immoral, disgusting, decadence, dirty, filthy, disrespectful. Transvestite: Me and mine. It's me without the others. Me alone with myself and sometimes with him. Immoral, unbearable suffering. I want to die. I'm going to die. I'm happy, thanks to the man who erased my life. My unbearable life. The rest? Corpse, bones, a human being's ashes. The rest... ife, death. I was dreaming I was a bird to take life's happiness on my wings. To feel heaven's air on my body. To dream about the "me" I was before and which disappeared. The bird was flying to forget its past. The bird was flying because he loved life... that gave him the power to hover above the dramas of below. Despite his torn heart, he could hope that everything would change. He had hoped so much. I'm falling asleep. Those simple words that feel so good: to fall asleep. To stop living. To perish. To disappear. To die from living. The bird that never was never will be. Who made mistakes? Daddy. I've fallen asleep. What did you do? Nothing at all. ook... a priest! We'll massacre him. Why so much hatred? I came to warn you: some men are looking for you to eliminate you. No kidding! We're so scared! Your suffering will stop to exist. All for Satan! I came to vanquish you with Good. Come to my side, you'll feel good. Are you telling the truth, priest? Yes, you should believe me. Everything you did until today can be straightened tomorrow. I apologize for all the evil I've caused. Forgive me. I want to be on your side. Thank you, my son. Satan... we offer you this power of Good. They piss me off, these three. I won't always wait here without doing anything. I too know where the hill is. They'll never stop! Bye, priest. I'll see you some day. Now we have to eliminate the kid. Our mission here is over. We should go. - I'll kill him by myself. - Go on! - I want to be alone. - So go outside! But make sure he doesn't escape. - eave me. - Wait, further. What are you doing? You can go. I'm sorry. Here, I give you my knife. After what we did to your mother, you can kill me. I would never do that. It's not your fault. It's those three men's fault. Nothing to do with you. - I forgive you. - How can you be nice after what happened? You must be an angel. I think that every time you do a good deed, every time you love and help someone, an angel awakens in us. - Are you sent by Good? - We are all children of God. - Do you want to come with me? - No, I can't. Finished, already? We didn't hear anything. There was nothing to hear. I let him go. ittle punk! Do you realize? He knows where we live. He'll tell on us. - I don't care. - What? You're the devil. What you taught me was horrible. The truth. We only taught you the truth. That's right. Come on, let's go. We won't get caught because of a kid. et's go, Yves. - Go without me. - eave him, teenager stuff. This time, it's my blood that flows. Where are you? I'll find you! The bastards! I'll find you! What do you read, granddad? An incredible article. A woman is said to have been attacked by a man in the mountain, and the man she was with is said to have been killed in that very mountain. The article says there are three men and a boy... who've been hiding in the mountain for many years. And they're doing some very bad things. What kind of bad things? You're a little too young to know what these people have done. But I can tell you that they are very bad people. But when they were little like me, they weren't bad. So why did they become bad? You know, some people are weak. They can't resist evil. I think it's that kind of people who live up there in the mountain. - Thanks. - That's nothing. Bye. Yves at 15 years of age. I'm sorry, I've made a mistake. - Wait, who are you looking for? - Dr. Richard. Exactly the same door, but one floor down. You can't go wrong. Shall I come with you? - You'll be alright? - I'm fine. - What you were singing was very nice. - Really? Yes. Could you sing it again? Yes. You've got a minute? Well, come on in, then. Sit over there. So, what's your name? I am Guilaine. Pleased to meet you. So, you have an appointment? I was supposed to see the doctor, but as it's the first time I've come, I got lost. Never mind. Good thing you made a mistake, so you heard me sing. If you ask me again to sing, I'll be delighted. - Do you want to have a drink? - I'd love one. - Here you are. - Thank you, madame. Not madame, Guilaine. I'm warning you, I've just finished composing it, so it's not perfect. We'll try, huh? - It's nice. - Do you want to sing with me? - No, I'm alright. - I'm telling you, it's easy. - I don't even know how to sing. - Never mind. It doesn't matter. It's very easy. That's good! - I'm going to be late. - Oh, sorry. I'd forgotten your appointment. - Don't make him wait. - I've got to go. I understand very well. Anyway, it was a pleasure singing with you. Same here. Come back whenever you want. You know... I like you. Okay, bye then, Guilaine. Today, Tuesday 15th September, fate knocked on my door, at last. While singing with this young boy, I found again, just for a moment, my smile and my joy... which I had lost for such a long time. 3 years. 3 years already since the two people I cherished most in the world left me, taken by fate. Damn truck. Why? Why did they leave so early? How are you today? - I'm fine. - You have less nighmares? I sleep quite well. I've got good news for you. You'll be able to live in a real family. ike a normal teenager. You'll have... a father and a mother who'll look after you well. - When will I see them? - Tomorrow. In 10 days you can move in. - Are you happy about that? - Yes. From now on, you'll come to see me only once a week. Would you like to talk about something in particular? Nothing in particular. Tell me again about your anguish. It's because of these three men who brought me up. - You won't see them anymore. - Yes, I know. But I saw all the atrocious things they did. They live with evil. They are evil. The police will catch them and they'll pay for everything they've done. - What will happen to them? - ife sentence. You look disappointed. Yes, especially for Alfred. - I was very close with him. - Too close? I know. You must try to forget these men. At first, you'll live with your anguish, then it will diminish, and they'll disappear eventually. When a bad picture comes to your mind, you should replace it by a beautiful thought. Give me an example. - I'm thinking about my mother. - You remember your mother. She was so beautiful. She had the face of an angel. Think about her when you feel bad. You'll see, it will help you. A mother, even if she isn't at your side anymore, always remains our best support. - I think about her often. - You miss her? Since I left these three men, I've missed her a lot. Do you remember your father? You miss him? Not too much. - I miss Alfred. - That's the man you were very close to? - Yes, that's him. - A contradiction. What do you like in him? Do you believe in God and Satan? Yes. For me, they do exist. Alfred told me that the world was going to come to an end and that evil would win. Good will win. It's all planned out. Alfred told you this because he lives with evil, for evil. It's logical that he believes in it. I'm deeply convinced of the opposite. I've studied the scriptures. "Harm a child, you harm God. " Maybe you'll find me corny, but everything that's written in here is true. I think our society will fall. For instance: "Then I saw a mighty angel come down from heaven. " "And the earth was lit up with his glory. At the top of his voice he shouted: "Babylon the Great has fallen. " "It has become the haunt of devils, a lodging for every foul spirit... and dirty, loathsome bird. " "All the nations have been intoxicated by the wine of her prostitution. " "Every king on the earth has committed fornication with her. " "And every merchant on the earth has grown rich through her debauchery. " Who is Babylon? Do you know? Babylon represents capitalism, i. e. money and power. I'm looking forward to reading it. Here. It's for you. Thank you. It's the first present I've received for a long time. The only way to eliminate the evil these men have taught you... is God. You should have been priest. Maybe. You okay? You look strange. - You said I'll forget my past. - Some of it, yes. I don't believe it. There are some things one never forgets. The kind of things which are engraved in you and which hurt like a knife in the back. I'll never forget the horror these men taught me... and what they did to innocent people. I'll never forget Alfred's ice cold hands. I'd like to be like a star at dawn, dimming away into oblivion to stop my suffering. 2 years ago, you couldn't even take a walk in the mountains. - Now, the psychos have gone. - I wonder where they're hiding. Maybe they're still around here. - Stop it, that's not funny. - Just kidding. We got them! - They got us. - I thought I was going to faint. - You're okay? - Yes, I'm fine now.
