If you see it, it's terrible. It doesn't affect me, except it makes a bad odor. - That's terrible. - Chaotic, I've never seen anything like it ... Today's other news ... Regarding the recent crisis ... Hey! Hey you guys! Let's go! We got the board. Stop them! Do not stop! Make them stop! Hey! Stop That's not your board! Come on! Move! Give it back! Stop Hey clown head! Come on! Beat him up! Come on! Sick! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Is this just me ... Or getting crazy out there. This is clearly tense. Disappointed people. The struggle, looking for work. This is a hard time. How about you? You keep your journal? Yes ma'am. Nice. Do you take it with you? Arthur. Last time, I asked you to bring your journal, but was disappointed. Can I see it? I use it as a journal. But also as a joke diary. Funny thoughts, or or quotes. I think I told you I was pursuing a career in comedy. No, you are not there. I think I exist. I just hope my death makes more sense than my life. How does it feel to have to come here? Does that help? Is there someone to talk to? I think I'm better when I'm locked in the hospital. And think more about ... Why are you locked? Who knows. I just wanted to ask the doctor if I could ask for additional treatment. Arthur, you're on 7 kinds of medicine. Surely they must have a reaction. I just want to feel not too bad anymore. I'm not bothering him. Stop it. It's okay, I have a card .. Sorry.. Hapi, can you check the letter, when you're there. Yes ma'am. No, nothing. Authorities say the city was attacked by a herd of rats. And now we fight mice. You stopped taking my letter. Thomas Wayne. Is he the one. Please ... I walked down the aisle for years. At least you can fight back. I can't, I'm tired. This. You have to eat. Look how thin you are. He became a great mayor. Everyone says that. Oh, yes. I guess too. Who are you talking to? Everyone on the news. He is the only one who can save the city. He owes it to us. Sit here honey. Well. From the NCB studio In the city of Gotham, this is direct. With Murray Franklin Tonight we welcome comedians Murray Franklin We have a great audience tonight. Wow, thank you, thank you. Thanks. So everyone heard about super mice in Gotham, right? Today, the mayor says he has a solution, are you ready for this? Super cat. Seriously, I mean ...

Okay, there's something special with you Arthur, I know. Where are you from? / I live here in this city. With my mother. Okay, wait, wait, there's something funny about that. I lived with my mother before, I succeeded. Only me and him. My father went to buy a packet of cigarettes. And he never returned. I know how Murray feels. I've been home for as long as I can remember. I take good care of my mother. All of those sacrifices, he must really love you. He really is. He always tells me to smile and show a happy face. He says I'm prettier spreading happiness and laughter. I like it, I like it very much, come here. Come on, tonight you have to go down. Come on! Come on! Okay, we have a big show tonight. Stay put, we will be back soon. That's great Arthur. Thanks. I can't say a word, it makes my day beautiful. Thank you friend. You see all this, the light, the show, the audience, all of that stuff, I'll leave it in a moment to a kid like you. Hello, Miss. Hey, how are you? One more day in a crazy city. You will come back? You are okay? I heard about the beating you experienced. Basic savage They are just a group of children, just leave them alone. No, they will take everything from you if you do that. All crazy things out there. They are animals. Hi guys. You know what. What is this. Take. It is for you. You have to protect yourself out there. Otherwise you will be harmed. Maybe. Jeez. It is okay. Nobody must know. You can pay me anytime. You know you're a good girl. Arthur. Hoyt wants to meet you in his office. You know what I always think? No, I do not know. You call it miniature golf, or just golf for you? Hello Hoyt. Gary said you want to see me. How about comedy? Are you famous? Not yet, still working on my material. Do not say. There is a big one. See. I like you Arthur, many think you're weird, but I like you. I don't even know why I like you. But I have a complaint. Begins to upset me. Kenny Music. Uh, the person said you disappeared. Not yet returned the sign. because I was robbed. Didn't you hear? The sign. That is bullshit. Does not make sense. Return the sign. He will go bankrupt, for the sake of Arthur. I do not know, sorry. How could I know why nobody did anything? If you don't return the sign, I have to take it from your salary. Are we clear? Look, I'm trying to help you. Okay, let me tell you something else. There are men who do not feel comfortable. Wait for me, wait! Thanks. Hi. This building is bad, huh? This building is bad, mom. Yes dear. That's very bad mom. Right mom? This building is bad, right. Hey. Hi ma'am. You'll come down later. Ma'am, why is the letter so important to you? What do you think he will do? He will help us. But you already wrote a letter 30 years ago, why would he help us? Because Thomas Wayne is a good man. If he knows how we live. If he saw this place, it would make him sick. I can't explain him better than that. Nobody cares mom. Or me. Everyone says that my joke is really for a big club. Hapi, what makes you think you can do that? What do you mean? / Well .. Do you want to be a comedian? Hey, what's your name? Arthur. Hey Arthur, you're a really great dancer. Oh, yes. This. Happy, are you okay? Mother, what? / What happened? I watch war movies. Shrink it! Sorry mom. Glad to see the couple on my show. I have a wife, we like playing roles. Yes, yes, very sexy. My favorite now is professors and seniors who passed my graduation time. Yes. So I did. I'm a professor at university. And my wife is senior in my western internal lessons. I know, I know, you should see it on the Intro. I don't believe too. He dumped me on my office watch. Monday and Wednesday, 3-5, so excuse me, professor Louis. I can't use my last name at this university, because they don't employ Jews. Something that seems outside, for now. Excuse me Professor Louis, I think I'm in danger of failing in western lessons. And I just want you to know I'm willing to do anything to graduate. I said, anything? He says.. Oh, hey. You followed me today? Yes. I feel you. I hope you come and rob this place. I have a gun. I will come tomorrow. You're so funny Arthur. Yes. You know what, I do comedy. You should come watch the show when and when. I can do that. Yes, you tell me when. Hm Wait, please, I like this job. Arthur, I want to know why you brought a gun to a children's hospital. This is a tool. Part of my play. That's bullshit! Nonsense! What kind of clown is carrying a gun? And Randall told me you tried to buy 38 of him last week. Randall tell you that? You're crazy, Arthur. And liar. You're fired! Next stop Gotham. I'm telling you he ... That was a mistake ... No, thank you. This... Very good He tried to be nice to me. This. Anyone bastard? Something funny, tell us, what's so funny? I have a condition ... Stay down, weird! Please! Please! I read he is a man with full makeup. No, it says mask here After all, it's good for business. They have clowns in all newspapers. Big people with big sentences. Hey Arthur, I know what happened. Sorry, man. It seems unfair. Fired like that. You really brought a gun to a children's hospital? What did you do it for? Is that funny? I guess he knows the trick. You gonna shoot yourself? Why don't you ask Randall about that? Here is his gun. I still owe you that, yes. What are you talking about? Stop talking from your butt. Oh no. I forgot to be absent. And while our city tries to make sense. 4 murders on the subway last week. we are joined by Thomas Wayne Look, Thomas Wayne is on TV. Yes, mom. They asked him about the subway murder. Thank you Thomas, I know this is a hard time. Oh yeah. - Looks like he's a campaign. There are only 3 words for Wayne Investment. Good, well educated, though I do not know them personally. Like all workers, they are family. You heard that, I told you ... Shh ... the anti-rich center in the city. Almost like the unfortunate townspeople took the side of killing. Yes, too bad. That's one of the reasons why I consider running for mayor. Gotham has lost its way What about eyewitness reports, the suspect is wearing a clown mask. That makes sense to me. What kind of coward does something so cold-blooded someone hiding behind a mask. So, they are more fortunate than themselves. If they are too afraid to show their own faces. until people like that change for the better Some of us are Making things in our lives, always looking at those who haven't It's nothing, just a clown. Thank you for coming. I heard this song on the radio that day. And that person sings His name is Clyfield. Arthur./ This is crazy. Because it's my clown name. Until a moment ago. It's like no one is there He and I don't know if I'm really real. Arthur, I have bad news for you. You did not hear me. I did not make you He only asks the same question every week, How is your work? Do you have negative thoughts? All I have is negative thoughts. But you did not hear either. I said for the rest of my life. I don't know if I even exist. But I exist. People are starting to lose They cut our funding. They closed the office next week The city cuts funding across the council, social services are part of it. This is the last time we will meet. how could they? They don't care about people like you Arthur. And they really don't care about people like me either. Sorry Arthur. I think most women see sex as buying a car. I can see myself for a long time. Is that safe? Can it be relied upon? Men see themselves as car parks I want to see this. Okay, it's finished my time, thank you all so much. Okay, next from southern Gotham. from a young age, everything he saw purpose in his life Is to bring laughter and excitement into this cold, dark world. I'm ok Please help me welcome Arthur Fleck. Hello, nice to be here. I think.. Who are those kids? I hated school when I was young. My mother would say What do you want to be later? There is no ma'am. I will be a comedian. This is one.

I think the same as you. What do they say mom What is your name I'm Bruce Get away from that person./ That's okay, I'm a good person What are you doing? Who are you? / I'm here to meet Mr. Wayne You shouldn't talk to his son Why did you give these flowers. No, they aren't real. This is magic I'm just trying to make him laugh. That's not funny, huh You want me to call the police? / No, please. My mother's name is Penny. Penny Fleck, he used to work here, could you please tell Mr. Wayne to meet him? You are the son. Yes. Do you know? I know about that too. He told me everything. There is nothing to know. There is no them. Your mother is stressed. She is sick. Just go. Before you make a fool of yourself. Thomas Wayne is my father. What happened? Straight to the back door. - I'm doing it. Is your mother on medication? When was the last time you talked to him. I don't know. Mr. Fleck. Sorry to bother you, I'm Detective Garrity, this is my detective Burke. We have a few questions for you, but you're not at home. So, we talked to your mother. What did you say to him? Did you do this? What? No, no, I'm just asking him a few questions. He was hysterical, breathing heavily, The doctor said he got a stroke. Sorry to hear about that ... Like I said, I still have a few questions for you. This is about the subway murder last week, you heard about them, right? Yes. That's terrible. We talked to your boss at Hahas I heard you got fired for bringing a gun to a children's hospital. That's a tool, part of my action. I'm a party clown. Why are you fired? He said I wasn't funny enough. Can you imagine that? If you don't mind. I have to take care of your mother. Your boss also gave us one of your cards. What's your condition, laughing You ... what kind of clown act. Action clown? / Yes. It means party action. What do you think? That's the only way out. I made coffee. Do you want some? So, that night I told my son Billy, you know the new one. I said trash can where Billy was, and he said I wasn't joking, and he said So where do we get our trash? And finally, in a world that everyone thinks can do my work. We have video tapes from the comedy club, this is the guy thought he could keep laughing and somehow that made him funny. Look at this joke. Jeez. My mom always says What do you want to be? No ma'am, I'll be a comedian. You have to hear your mother. And one more Bobby, look at another one, I like this guy. That's funny, when I was little And tell people I'll be a comedian. Everyone laughed at me, nobody laughed now. You can say that again, man. OK. I have a good program for you tonight. So stay here ... And new music for enthusiasm ... Tell Mr. Wayne, this is what was said, this whole system. Wayne recently announced his candidacy for mayor will attend the event. You might remember Thomas Wayne who first mentioned Gotham citizens as a problem, and today He offered help with political means. I will say there is something wrong with those people, I'm here to help them. I will lift them out of poverty, make their lives better, that's why I nominate. Maybe it's not realized, but I'm their only hope. Can I help a friend? That hurts to say. Do you want an autograph or what? What did he ever do to you? Penny Fleck is my mother. Gosh, You came to my house yesterday. Yes, sorry I just came. But my mother told me everything. And I have to talk to you. / I'm not your father. What is wrong with you? Look at us. I'm sure you're my father. That's impossible. Because you were adopted, and I didn't sleep with your mother. I wasn't adopted. Oh, God, he never told you? Tell me what? Your mother adopted you when she worked for us. That is not true. Why did you say that? / Because he was arrested for robbing a hospital When you were little. I don't need you to tell lies. I know it looks strange. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable, I don't know why people are so rude. I don't know why you are, I don't know why I think of you. I'm just asking for a little courtesy. What's with you people? You see what you made for my mother? / She's crazy. Do you think this is funny? This is me. You touch my son again, I'll kill you.

No. They could not carry the grave to save their lives.
