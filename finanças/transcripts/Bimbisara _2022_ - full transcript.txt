Friend… Friend! This feels eerie. We must somehow escape from here. Friend, soldiers are coming. Let's go this way We are between the devil and the deep sea. -Welcome, my Lord! -Who are you? I am a spirit imprisoned in the mirror. I am released from my curse thanks to you. In gratitude, I present you this magic mirror which will be useful for your present and future. Please accept it, Emperor. Where are we going, Dad? To the kingdom ruled by the great emperor Bimbisara. Is it? But what is there? It has the Dhanwantari, an encyclopaedia, which is the life line of humanity. It has amazing secrets that even science cannot fathom. If we get hold of it, the world will be in our control. The Dhanwantari you have been waiting for all this time is just one step away. Ah! We have done it, Sastri! We have done it. Stop the boy from rushing, Sastri. Go on! Subramanya! Stop! Subramanya! Don’t touch it! No, no! Subramanya! Dad! -Sastri! Dad! Renowned industrialist RK admitted to hospital with severe health issue. Treatment is on under the supervision of Dr Subramanya Sastry. People around the state are waiting for his safe return. -Good morning sir. -Good morning. Please check on him every hour. Wait, wait! The patient is ok. No need to worry. -Please wait. -Sir, patient's family. -How is he now, sir? -He is fine. Ok, -Thank you sir. -Namaste! A new sensation in the history of Medicine is Dr Subrahmanya Sastri! Dhanwantari Hospitals stand address for so many new treatments. You are really great, Sir. There are numerous doctors in the city. None of them could revive him to conscious. But with your one touch, he got back his life. The entire state is talking about your success, Sir. This is no success. These are no achievements. My success would be when I find Dhanwantari. And when I fulfil my to my dad. Huh! Ketu! “Most formidable of all worlds, have mercy” “The commander of the Shivites, be pleased” “Hail, Mother Kali! Show mercy!” How long, Kethu? How many years should I wait? I left no stone unturned for it. My dad wished this world to surrender to my feet. Will it remain a dream? Will it come true, Ketu? It will come true. It will definitely come true, Sastri. Kethu! Just because I ask you about the book every morning, are you telling me a fairy tale? Do you take me for a fool? Time defines everything that happens in the world. Time is the only bridge between both of you. The one who discarded the book will ride over time and hand it to you. It is his duty. When Saturn commands Jupiter in the eighth House, as Venus wanes and Moon gains power, wading through that very time- while entering the present, it’s time to stand in the face of death, Sastri. He will come himself. He will open the treasure trove. His acumen startles history itself. He is a genius with keen sense of observation. He is someone who killed his own kid brother for insubordination. He is Bimbisara. Without ever sheathing his sword, occupying all the kingdoms that his horse rode, hacking the kings who confronted, erasing the borders of his kingdom, drenching the land in blood, using tireless despotism, commanding a kingdom with no enemies, and vassals who could not stand up, was the imperious emperor. In the times when weapons fought for their own life against him, an overbearing emperor who built invincible empire of Trigartha, is Bimbisara. (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) Hail, Bimbisara. (Praising Bimbisara) Jagajjajjarika! (Praising Bimbisara) Zubeida! -My king? What is the court’s agenda today? Nothing much, my King. People are celebrating your victory as theirs. It’s only praise of you all around, my king. And? Er…hailing your victory and seeking your alliance, the neighbouring kings have sent presents to you, my king. In that case- -My king! Allow them. -As you command. Huh! My king! What is it? Melting his own crown, the Pandya king- has made a sword and sent you, King. A sword out of his crown! So he has kept his head at your feet, my King. Next! What is it, fool? This is the Sanjeevani flower, my King.	-Aha! If used within one hour of death, the dead person will come back to life. But this can be used only twice, my King. Ha ha ha First revive him. Or you will die. -I got rebirth! -This is a real Sanjeevini, my King. This is a miracle. Felicitate him. -My king! But why do I need this flower? Valour to kill Bimbisara is yet to be born, Zubeida. Bhageera! -My King! Removing all obstacles, our kingdom shall expand across the borders beyond the other kingdoms. Send a message to the Kingdom of Asmaka warning them of Bimbisara’s imminent invasion. Surrender shall mean survival and confrontation shall spell death. Bimbisara’s warning to the Kingdom of Asmaka. Along with you all the kingdoms that expanded under your patronage- -must bow to the throne of Trigarta, respect our annexations and agree to slavery under us. Those who disagree lose their heads. Kingdoms that refuse will burn. Before this victory tour turns into invasion Before this edict spells death I must hear your reply. Tell him it is not possible. Shall I carry the same message, Princess? Also convey that threatening is no quality of the valiant. If Bimbisara hears of it, not a soul will be left in Asmaka kingdom. (Scoffs) Convey that Asmaka Kingdom will not bow down to a despot. Diamonds, gems and emeralds! Elephants are getting tired carrying this big treasure. Make it fast. Oh no! My king! You have saved us. All the diamonds and precious stones- Gems and sapphires- They are all reaching our treasure trove. -Hmm. Mmm…I have a doubt. -Cry it out. What if someone eyes the treasure in your absence? Is the treasure pulling your heart’s strings, Zubeida? When my heart is filled with you, where is the place for wealth? I gave my life for your happiness. But you suspect me. Don’t worry, Zubeida. You have to face the aborigines of the Cherokee race. It is not humanly possible. What if the Cherokee tribe is tempted? After all it’s wealth. No one can open the door except me. I sealed it with my hand prints, my voice... Jagatjajjarika! ...and my blood drops. -Aha! If someone else tries to open it, they die instantly. A wealth that the world hasn’t seen is the property of Bimbisara! “Mighty king who rules the warfare” “A romantic charmer” “Be it war or love” “You are your equal” “Moonflower like youth” “Hums around, take notice” “Young maiden’s jubilant heart” “Welcomes you to it” “This beauty pines for you” “Caress it to your heart’s fill” “A feast awaits you” “Step across the borders” “Rock me on the swing of pleasure” “Sway me on the melodies of romance” “Pamper me tenderly, Bimbisara” “Vocables” “This peahen has dreamed of you, come closer.” “Vocables” “This peahen has dreamed of you, come closer.” “Let desires take charge” “Let Cupid excel in his job” “Wish for the maiden’s company” “Let your chivalry embrace her” “Let romance be ripe” “Grab this great chance” “No one around is as handsome as you” “No one has your glow; nor today nor morrow” “This is no overstatement” “Making the moon sleepless” “Making the jasmines blush” “Imprison me in your golden hug, Bimbisara” “Vocables” “This peahen has dreamed of you, come closer.” “Vocables” “This peahen has dreamed of you, come closer.” “Moonflower like youth” “Hums around, take notice” “Young maiden’s jubilant heart” “Welcomes you to it” We have erred, o King. Please spare our lives. Why do you grovel at his feet, Father? Death is more welcome. So is it better to kill? Father! Father! I am impressed by your hope and attempt to kill me. A proud princess like you deserves a place next to me. What comes of killing you? Romancing is more pleasurable. Father! Father! Father! Father! Master! The situation is horrible. Hail, Dhanwantari! Stop it! Stop it, boys! Stop it! Stop it! What happened? How dare you help the enemy? Medicine is our duty, son. We only did our duty. You committed treason. How dare you back answer on top of that? Stop! Wait! Please don’t be hasty. Did they rebel knowing it was Bimbisara’s army? Yes, your majesty. Why do you want to involve in such a small matter? With your permission, let us send the Karala army, my King. A spear on a sparrow, my King? A spear on a sparrow? -My King! I mean Minister! When we approach a sparrow what does it do? It flies away, my king. What if it steps forward and stares at us, instead of flying? Er…we wonder why it wasn’t flying. What if it takes another step and stares at us? We will be afraid it might peck at us, my King. Fear… The fear in your eyes raises the confidence in its heart. The vassals are waiting to see fear in Bimbisara’s eyes. They wait to annex this empire. But no one dare stand up to me. In such a kingdom of mine, the sound of wastrels beating my soldiers… That sound is heard by my enemies beyond borders as the inefficiency of Bimbisara. It gives them the courage to look into my eyes and speak. Is this a small thing? It is not a small matter, my King. But they are innocent villagers. For generations, they have been treating our people and the people of other kingdoms. They are not capable of a revolt or a rebellion. Why don’t you once consider- Watch him, Zubieda. The audacity that began in a remote village now makes even this weakling raise his voice. Tell me now. Is this a small matter? -Hmm…no, my King. What shall we do then? Kill, my King. -Kill what? Their courage, my King. By the way grandpa, why are we lighting so many lamps? Today is the birthday of Dhanwantari, God of our sect. Who is Dhanwantari? -He is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Who is he? One who appears from time to time in order to establish order. Lord Vishnu is a God who incarnates himself in order to quell the wicked. At the time of churning the milky ocean, when the gods were saved from demons and while distributing the elixir among the gods which was earlier stolen by the demons, a drop of elixir fell to Earth. Every plant that sprung from that drop became medicinal. It became a panacea for all diseases. Ayurveda is the science created by Dhanwantari. It’s a divine book for the entire humanity. Grandpa! What if the demons come for it again? A demon every eon and an evil man every generation keep appearing. But along with them, God also appears to our rescue. You saved our Master and taught the commander a good lesson. By his grace… How dare you defy us? Grandpa! Grandpa! Lord Shiva! Grandpa! He is saving it risking his life. Is it so valuable? -Probably, my King. In that case, isn’t it supposed to be with us? Grandpa! -Sarvari! Grandpa! Please leave this book alone. -Don’t hurt my grandpa. Grandpa! Mercy, mercy! My king! Please forgive us and spare our lives. So, old man! You were narrating some legendary stories on the festival day. You should also teach Bimbisara would appear if someone rebels. We don’t have either the idea or the courage to defy you, My King. You had no fear while helping the enemy soldiers. Why are you afraid now? Public that doesn’t fear the king is no good for the kingdom. Grandpa! -Dear! Is he the demon you were talking of? No, dear. He is not a demon. Wait there, old man! What else did your grandpa tell you? He said when a demon comes killing people, God would also arrive to save the people. Why hasn’t God come yet? -He will appear. When will he appear? He will come when you light this lamp before him. Oh! Is he going to kill me? -Yes, he will. She is just a kid and spoke out of innocence. Please spare her, my King. No one is born yet who is man enough to confront you, my King. Is there anyone else? Bhagira? -My King! Please don’t! She is just a kid. Please spare her. Please! World’s- -Dear! Sarvari! World’s- -Don’t go. World’s enchantress! -Grandpa! -Dear! The lamp has reached your God. But there is no sign of God. Life has left before the wish was fulfilled. Sad! Dear! Sarvari! Sarvari! Dear! You had no compassion even for a child. Why did you kill so many innocent people? These deaths shall be the beginning of your ruin. Every step you take from now will be towards destruction. Your kingdom will be in ruins along with you. Your sin will become your curse. Look at that, Bhagira! He knows God won’t appear. So he thinks he is god and is cursing me. Bimbisara is synonymous with a death warrant. Whether a demon or a god- It is Bimbisara alone here. Their belief that lamp brings light into their lives, shall be burnt in the same flame. My king! I have invited artists from across the nation. With your permission, I shall present to you your handsome personality in a portrait. Please come. If I find my portrait exquisite, half my kingdom shall be given. Otherwise, his head… -will be yours. HA HA HA. Zubeida! -Ah! Whose is it? -It’s Your Majesty’s my Lord. Do I look like that? -No, My King. Why did he portray me that way then? He was painting Lord Bimbisara himself. His hands must have shivered. In that case take him away and get him trampled by elephants till death. Who is there? Let him be trampled. Hmm. He has painted a bigger picture. Let us take a look. Oho! So, his time is running bad. -Huh? The portrait of Bimbisara. Please behold. Marvellous! Charmer! What is this device? This is called a mirror, my king. It reflects our form as it is. You have redefined creation. A magician has made this, my King. We have carried it from far off lands because you enjoy rarities. Lord! Please don’t. It should not be touched. -Huh? It shatters when touched. It should be handled with care. Felicitate him with gems and precious stones. -Your command, my King. I am blessed, my king. Let this be a little higher. How are you Zubeida? Though not as handsome as you, I am ok with my thin moustache. -Huh? Ah! Pardon me, my King. You are looking at your image in the mirror meant for me. So I would like you give you a present. -Will I be trampled by elephants? A thousand and one whip lashes. I am blessed. You confined it to whip lashes. Such a wonderful mirror deserves to be in my chamber. As you command. Place it in King’s chamber. My king! I have a doubt. -Express it. This body, this regality... Who would own this? Stop wasting your time with flattery but go and the princess- I understand. First drinks and then the girl. His Majesty is a romantic, passionate lover. Is this real or is it intoxicant? It's real. What you see is real. Are you still alive, Devadatta? The Devadatta you killed is standing before you. Though I am your blood brother, you pushed me away from the kingdom. I never looked back at the kingdom or the people. Why are you here now? To get killed in my hands? No. For the Trigartala. With all your arrogance and presumptuousness, you destroyed a village and cruelly killed a small kid. You deprived me of what I wanted and yet stood in my way. I have come to get rid of you and take over the kingdom. You wanted something and I deprived you of it? Princess Ira of Asmaka Kingdom. Ha ha ha. Oho oho! So my brother is in love. And now you are here before me to win your love. Nice. What is the fun in romancing a princess? Imprisoning you and romancing your love in front of you is fun. Hope buried in the womb of time has moved the universe. This is the end of demonic darkness. With the creation as witness arrives the champion of champions. You won't know where you landed and you won't be able to come back. This kingdom and these people are mine now. The girl I loved is mine. Devadatta shall be the Bimbisara who would rule over Trigarta. Sastry! A miracle is going to take place in the great universe. It's time for your dream to come true; for your anticipation to bear fruits. Defying the planetary movements and overpowering the wheel of time, at a lightning speed Bimbisara is going to step on to the earth, Sastri. Has Bimbisara arrived, Kethu? -Yes. To catch hold of him and to get what you want depends on you, Sastri. Search. Search every nook and corner. Hey, what are those sounds from the container? We have precious antiques inside. If something goes wrong, we will lose our jobs. Let's go and check. Careful! Come on, climb up. Hey! There is someone here, man! Brother... -Wait. Don't panic. Who is this guy? Hey, he looks more ancient than the goods here. I guess he got drunk while loading and slept off here. Let us throw him out. Give me a hand. Ok. Ok. Let's go. Hey, he seems to be gone. Sir! You wanted to see -You have to find someone. Oh, my! This guy is alive. Finding is our profession. From Ongole to Mongolia wherever he is on the planet, I will bring him before you in ten days. Give me his name and details. He belongs to the fifth century. He is here right now. Is he in coma? Hmm. He is alive. He is now visiting our times. He is alive? In the present? How did he travel? In a space ship? Time machine? Come on, Sir. Stop joking. I have lots of things to do. Hey, you may have lots of things to do. But for me this is the only job. But how do I recognize him? Among the one crore thirty lakhs people in this city, he would look unique. Time, air and people...everything would look strange to him. He struggles to adapt. Sir, a photo of his will be helpful. Will he be in this costume? Baburao! Be careful. I want him alive. Umm... aha... What is this sound? In what world am I? So, the mirror wasn't an ordinary one. It had powers. My wicked brother! How cruel you were! What shall I do? What shall I do? I must first find out which world I am in. Hey, dummy! Watch your cut. Maintain uniform size. Check. First finish that job. Hmm...what world is this? This is Earth. Our world! -Umm... You are masquerading in the middle of the night. Pshaw! Get lost. This man is full of attitude. I will show him. Have you seen him? No? Hit it...hit it...that's right. Stop. Uncle...there is some nuisance going on there. Go and check. I mean... they look like filthy rich Banjara Hills batch. Should we interfere? Check! God! Stop it! What is this drunken nuisance in the middle of the night?	-Hmm! What do you mean hmm? Madam is calling. Come! I didn't respond even to Ivanka. How do you think I would come if she asks? Ask her to come here. Boys! Start the music! Madam! Hey, what is this nuisance at midnight? You address me ‘hey'? Who the hell are you? Madam...SI Vyjayanti. You are no police. You are like a fatless chicken. Madam, let's go. -How dare you? Oh, no!	-Hey! -What are you blabbering? Hey, right company at the right time! Do you know who I am? I am SI Vyjayanti. How dare you refuse to come when I call? -Round her up and show her our power. Hmm...who is there? We are here. Who are you? You look so different. King of Trigarta! Bimbisara! We are no less. We are kings too. He is MS Raju. He is Dil Raju and I am Bangarraju. The gold man! Hmm! Who is bothered about you? That sound is hard on our tympanic membrane. Stop it. What did you say? -HMM...tympanic membrane! Ha! I get it. The prize you deserved in drama was given to some dimwit. So you are frustrated and are on the roads. An artist should never be on the streets. We shall present you a gift. Let me give you this gold chain. Please accept it. Fool! How dare you gift me gold? We use this for horse's shoe in our kingdom. You deserve the first prize for sure. There was definitely some foul play. Hmm. Stop your drivel and suspend that clangour. No. Hey, turn up the volume. What would you do? Are you going to hit me? Hit me? Bhagira! -Bhairava! Brother, one peg. -That's the timing. My man is here and served me. Where is your man?	-Umm! What do you mean ‘umm'? Are you going to hit me? Hmm? Hit me? Do you dare touch me? Can you survive in this area after that? Can you?	-Umm! Sir, I have gravely mistaken your appearance. I didn't know you were Samara Simha Reddy in flash-back. Please forgive me, Sir. Madam! -Hmm... We should have someone like him with us. Our range would go higher. Hmm. I feel the same. Wow! We are in sync for the first time. Hmm! -Thank God! Hello! Hello! Er...I am Vyjayanti. -Who is this Jayanti? Not Jayanti. I am Vyjayanti. Ask him. Er...if you come with us, we will give you a job. What does 'job' mean? Go with us. Follow Madam's orders. And you will be paid. Fool! How dare you offer me work! Vanish from here. -Hey, hey! Wait! Listen. The king doesn't seem to be in a good mood. We better leave. Hmm! Who are you? How dare you sit next to me? Sit elsewhere. Hey, old man! Do you hear? I am very hungry, Sir. I will have food and go away.	-Hmm! If you are uncomfortable, why don't you go elsewhere? Hmm! How dare you talk back to me? -Ouch! Ouch! Why did you kick him? -He sat next to me. What's wrong with it? How can a beggar sit next to me? I am Bimbisara. Kicking a blind man in the presence of God, who is the origin of good and evil is wrong, son. Hmm! Who is he to decide sins and virtues? Who are you to tell me? The arrogance that you are greater than God is stupidity. History is yet to see a man who won life with his ego. As long as you remain egoistic, you will not see value in anything. By the time you realize the value, you won't find your own life. Let go of your ego. Brahma, who writes every one's destiny, has marked his fate like this. Find out what your destiny is. "A never before miracle happened on earth" "A never before miracle happened on earth" "A destiny that was never written in heaven saw light" "That you are your own God is a thing of the past" "This is a world full of demons worse than you" "Time has thrown a circle round your heavy head" "God has played a new trick" "The proof is Bimbisara became a mendicant" "God has played a new trick" "The proof is Bimbisara became a mendicant" "Life lulled in royal pomp has tasted the smell of soil" "Life lulled in royal pomp has tasted the smell of soil" "Heart yearning for blood now craves a sip of water" "There is one who determines the right and wrong" "There is Karma that pronounces punishment" "In the same life...o...o" "You bear the fruits of your actions in the same life" "God has played a new trick" "The proof is Bimbisara became a mendicant" "With the quelling of hell, the festival of lights began" "With the quelling of hell, the festival of lights began" "With the story of unethical Ravana, a new history blossomed" "Whether you are a demon or a defender you remain a question" "Whether you will grow into a ray of hope is an unknown dream" "When shall...O...O..." "When shall your journey take which direction" "God has played a new trick" "The proof is Bimbisara became a mendicant" "God has played a new trick" "The proof is Bimbisara became a mendicant" Yuk! What is this stink? Oh no! What is this? It looks like my mirror. But how did it fit into this box? Let me take a look. Wait. Some guy calls it a mirror or terror. What is this? -Who the hell are you? You are dressed in strange costume and checking your face on the one crore worth car as though it were your bathroom mirror. On top of that you call it a box! How dare you? Tsk. This guy has a lot of attitude! What do you mean? -I will show you. Bah! Bah! What is this? Great man! He left the girl alone. Hey, close the door. If comes back, he won't spare even my inners. Yay! My mirror! When I open my eyes this time, I will be in my kingdom. This doesn't look like my kingdom. In that case, this is not my mirror either. Let me search for it. Hmmm! -Is this decency? What did the poor mirror do? You broke the mirror and refused to pay the money? Do you call this decency? Hey, how indecent? I am talking to you and you are walking away! This is not my mirror. Decency! Decency! Decency! O magical mirror! Where shall I look for you? All decency is gone. Only this was left. Even this decency is gone! Madam is busy in interrogation, Sir. She will call you. Ok, Sir. I mean it’s third degree. So it takes time. Ok, Sir. Ok. Damn! Why this torture, Madam? His expectations are Everest. Our performance is worst. Solve just one case. Promotion for me and elevation for you. Moreover, the entire department is against us. Especially the DGP! We have only one option. -Which is? Bimbi… If he is with us, not just in the department, you will be famous all over the city. I wonder who he is. I wonder if we find him again. Very well! If it is our destiny, not only will we find him. He might come back to us and make friends. Who knows? Madam! I think it’s a terrorist attack. Charge! What sort of decency is this? I brought you to the station for breaking the mirrors in my shop. You display the same decency here! What sort of crazy decency is this? Hey! Bimbi! Madam! Didn’t I tell you? It’s in our destiny. Hello, Sir! Come in, Sir. Come. Please come. Hey! Tsk! Hey! Why did you break the mirror? To go back to my kingdom Which kingdom? -Trigartala Agartala? -Hmm…fool! The kingdom of Trigarta. Ok, you should catch a bus to go to your place. Why do you want to catch a mirror? Because I came through it. -There you go. Some mirror must have broken on his head and blocked his mind. I will set it right. Just wait. My King! -Hmm? Let me tell you a secret. I have also come through the mirror. Which is your kingdom? You are from Kingdom of Trigarta. We are from Kingdom of Praise. Why didn’t we annex your kingdom? -Ha ha ha. If you come with me, you can enter my kingdom through my mirror. You can exit to your kingdom through your mirror. Then come back and annex my kingdom to your fill. His idea sounds quite good. -Then don’t tarry but hurry. Hmm. If I do, will you get me my miracle mirror? Hmm. Along with the miracle mirror, I will also get you magic dressing table, magic talcum powder, magic lipstick. Apply all over your face and leave for your kingdom. Follow me first. -Hmm… Madam, please advance. I should first change his language and dressing. Or it gets difficult. Uncle! How long? -Here he comes. It’s all dark through this. I am very fond of darkness. Let me wear them. What? -Please proceed, Bimbisara. Enough of staring! Proceed. As usual, on behalf of our Foundation, the minister will felicitate the selected few involved in public service through the fields of health, education and trust activities. Why did the chariot stop? I have some work here. I will be back in five minutes. Stay here till then. I request chairman of Dhanwantari Hospitals, Mr Subramanya Shastri, who has done extensive service in the field of health, to come on to the dais and accept the award. -Hello sir, congrats! -Thank you. Honourable Minister, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for having me here tonight. I am deeply honoured and moved by your gesture. I like to thank Icon Awards for having me here tonight. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Sir, we need your signature here. How did my Prasadam come here? I now invite on to the stage Mr Viswanandan Varma, who has been serving the poor through his charitable trust, to receive the award. Hello sir! Ok, Sir. Jayanti! O Jayanti! -What is it? Ok, thank you, Sir. Hello! This glory is not mine. No one deserves this glory. No one can. I am coming, uncle. Only one person deserves all this fame and glory. -Let’s go. Our dynasty’s renowned king. The great emperor Bimbisara. Bimbisara? Yes. He owns all the glory and reputation. You may be surprised. We have been doing this service for 40 generations now. We are still following the path they have laid. Bimbi! But no matter how many generations pass by, no one equals him. His character is our idol. As king, right is his principle. As a person, humanity is his way. His ideals are our lives today. He established righteousness. We safeguard those values. As his descendent, it is my honour to receive this award on his birthday. My descendants? -Do Bimbisara’s descendants exist? Shafi! -Sir? -They are his descendants. If he comes to know, he will definitely go to them. If you find someone new or strange near their house, you must inform me immediately. Got it? -Ok, Sir. What happened, Bimbi? -Follow that chariot. -Are you fine, Subbaiah? -I'm fine, sir. -Is everything ready? -Ah, ready Dad. Greetings, Sir. Please come. Did Rajeev call? Yes, Dad. He is not done with his work yet. Where is the baby girl? -She is playing over there. Let’s go, Dad. Is the whole staff here? Let's go. -They are all here, Sir. Namaste, sir -Who is he? This is Srinivas, Sir. He studied here since school. He doesn’t want to go abroad in spite of many offers. He says we give value based education and so insists on working here with your permission, Sir. You want to do your bit for the generations who have faith in values. What more do I want? Good decision. Carry on. What is the status of C block construction? Jagatjajjarika! -Grandpa! Paradise is only in a woman’s lap. My Lord! I see a new angle in you! I have just discovered it, sweetheart! What if His Majesty Bimbisara comes to know of our romance? How would he? But he has changed a lot you know? He has become more romantic. Really? Is this romance because of that? Ah…come, my precious! Lord! Lord! My Lord! There are not so many lords here. Only one. Tell me. King Bimbisara wants you immediately. Such hurry makes lots of things drop. Move. Come on. My King! Zubeida! Send a message to the princess. -Yes, my King. Wait! -Yes, my King. What message will you give her? What else? That King Bimbisara is arriving for a consummation. Be ready. Otherwise he will forcefully smooch you. It is our custom to respect ladies. -Mm hmm… Extending our apologies for bringing the princess forcefully, tell her we will be sending her back in all royal customs. How strange? Bimbisara wants to apologize? Hmm! -Er…I will convey it. Why this new message of apologies? I know you too well to trust you. Do you take me for a fool, Bimbisara? You are not at all wrong. But you should know the truth. I won’t fall for your tricks, Bimbisara. First of all I am not Bimbisara. I am the one who sent Bimbisara, your abductor, to endless space. I am Devadatta, his brother. Bimbisara has a brother? -Yes. We are twins. He tried to kill me after our father died, thinking I'd come in his way for power. I could escape death, but permanently went away from this Kingdom. While I was travelling so, I saw you one day. This is what you call beauty. You can only see beauty. I can see the danger behind it. She is a princess in a palace. You are a commoner outside it. Do we really need this jam? “O honey-tongued maiden” “Your slender waist sounds a clarinet” “It drags me to you” “O gentleman with a pencil moustache” “Your furtive looks dance around” “It feels so good” “Your smooth cheeks” “And their red hues” “Entice me” “Your witty speech” “And your sporting spirit” “Toy with my heart” “They push me to follow you” “They prod me to join you” “They bring smiles in your favour” “They goad me to walk your path” “Your coy looks across the wall” “Arouse a fire” “The silken beds and jasmine couches” “Become unbearable” “Lip curves and sweet pains” “Provoke and watch on” “Knifes of grace and pains of pleasure” “Laugh stressing further” “Bold thoughts of you” “To open the doors of passion” “Keep knocking without break” “They push me to follow you” “They prod me to join you” “They bring smiles in your favour” “They goad me to walk your path” “O honey-tongued maiden” “Your slender waist sounds a clarinet” “It drags me to you” Friend? -Ah! Ugh! Who is there? Catch them! Let’s go, friend! I tried several times to tell you this. But this had to happen before you knew the truth. Even after hearing this, if you don’t trust me- I leave it to your decision, Ira. This pest asks me to find a man who doesn’t exist. Tell me, Sir. Where are you, Baburao? -I am looking for him, Sir. When you are happily roaming bars and pubs, how will you find him, idiot? Do I smell so far? Phew! He was born in the 5th century. And he travelled forward here. I am supposed to find him! Who on earth would name himself Bimbisara? I must look like a fool! Hey, get up! What did you just say, brother? Fool… -Before that? Who on earth… -Between both of them? I used a name. -Exactly. What was the name? Uff! Bimbisara. -What’s your business with him? What do you care? -I just want to help you. How I wonder. -Just missed it, bro. He made me see death from so close. Messing with him is like getting a passport to death. Are you talking about this guy? He almost looks like this, bro. I am saying this for your own good. Stop looking for him and take some rest. Hey, put this guy in the car. He may come in useful. Why don’t you understand? Bah! Alladi Baburao here. No one can stand before him. -He is gone! Grandpa! This sin will turn into a curse for you. I have wronged. Pride overtook my humanity and I killed a child. What wrong have you done? Caught in the wheel of time, you are giving in to false reality and forgetting the actual truth. That’s why I stand before you as a witness. Bimbisara had done nothing wrong. He had! Not one or two but hundreds of wrongs. What are they? Wasn’t it wrong to kill your own brother for power? But that is a war strategy. Wasn’t it cruel to treat people like slaves? No. That was royal justice. What was Dhanwantaripura’s crime? -Defying the king. I cruelly and mercilessly killed a girl. Wasn’t it wrong?	-No, it is not. But today the same girl saved Bimbisara’s life. What about that? -That’s destiny. The same destiny made Bimbisara come here. It made me realize my mistakes. It turned me into a human being. You have lost your way and speak without sense, Bimbisara. You forget that you are a great emperor. I didn’t forget. I just became human. Hi, Uncle. "A story came out from the heart and the throat" Can you forgive me, dear? What for, Uncle? I committed a unforgivable crime because of my stupidity. Now I ask for your forgiveness. Will you forgive me, dear? "A story came out from the heart and the throat" “Happy tears rolled from my eyes” “Friendship making fun with the times” “Crossing the days, borders and the worlds” “A relation asked to give hand” “A bonding to repay, this is the destiny” “A relation asked to give hand” “A bonding to repay, this is the destiny” “I’ll be the brother to give anything if asked” “I’ll be a shadow as companion if called for” “No kingdoms can match your company” “No worry in day and night” “Eyes got wet in love never known before” “A relation asked to give hand” “A bonding to repay, this is the destiny” “A relation said to give life for you” Bimbi, Bimbi! Leave me. -Drive, man! -Bimbi! Who brought the kid? -What if we don’t tell you? You are not even 100 in number. You may not know what a battle is. I say this for your own good. Hand me the kid and leave. Ha ha ha! There are no men here to shiver at your warnings. We are wolves. If any of you is interested in life, bring the girl you abducted and hand her over to me. ‘No, we won’t budge. We won’t leave. We will kill you.’ If you want to say that, you will see how it feels when war lands on you. You will hear no cries for mercy but howls of death. (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) This is what war is! Didn’t I tell you that once he enters the rink, it feels like a tiger’s claw? You wanted to trap him, catch him and kill him and carried death along. (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) Bimbi! I am scared, Bimbi! (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) If the God of Death asks you who sent you there tell him that there is someone down below. His name is Bimbi. Tell him, it’s the Sovereign of the Trigartala empire, Bimbisara. Can a man be so violent? This is massacre. He is no human, Sir. A demon! Om kreem greem! Attract Bimbisara. Sastry, who came here is no other but the Bimbisara we have been waiting for. This is the only proof showing his appearance. Look at his magnificent form. An image of Ravana that the demons never got to see. A demon's cry that no battle heard. A war that no enemy wins. The emperor of Trigartala... Bimbisara's resplendent awe-inspiring form! It never happened till yesterday. We only helped people and never had enemies. A girl is born after generations. And they have abducted her.. just a little girl. If he didn't appear like God that day, could we have got the child back? I don't understand whether this indicates the end or the beginning of something. We don't know what sins were committed and by whom. But we are paying for them now. Daddy! Hi! Hi, baby! How are you? -Fine, daddy! Greetings, Dad. Greetings, Sir. We are forever indebted to you for saving the baby. “I’ve seen the glowing smiles with my eyes” “I’ve met myself hidden in the eyelids” “Every minute with you feels like a rainbow” “No worry in the day and night” “Heart felt happy in love never experienced before” “A bonding is ready to sacrifice life” “This is the relation, the destiny” “A bonding asked to give a hand” “A heaven is seen in dancing and singing” “Kingdom where King turned slave is yours” What is the reason for this crisis in our kingdom? We don't know who has sinned or who has cursed, my King. All the crops have caught fire turning into ash. People are dying in disasters. They have no grains. People are facing terrible problems, your majesty. Open our granary to the public. Impossible, my King! We can save only a few with the stocks we have. Such a huge empire! We are so many! Can't we think of some solution to help the people? Think! There is a solution, my King. -What is it? The treasure you have saved. -The treasure I have saved? I mean the treasure you have sealed personally and saved. Greetings, your Majesty! You wanted to see me immediately. I will ask you some straight questions. Answer them as straight. -Yes, your Majesty. Who am I? -Our emperor Bimbisara. As per your knowledge, who am I? Your Majesty! What must be in your mind... Be fearless, Minster. Bare your heart without any fear. Your Majesty! Your father had different ideals. His administration was entirely different. Ego and power are like two swords that can't get into a single sheath. You think the kingdom is ruled by power. Power clubbed with ego doesn't last long, your majesty. Forgive me if I have spoken wrong. No, Minister. You are right. Two men were born sharing my father's ideals. One of them became the king of this kingdom. The other is dead in the eyes of the world. There is something no one knows. He is not dead. He stands before you in the place of Bimbisara. I could come back to this kingdom. But I am not able to help this kingdom. I cannot retrieve that treasure, Minister. You can, your Majesty. There is a way. What is it? Based on a man's speech, lineage and radiance, an aura forms around him. For you to open it instead of him, we must perform a ritual. As the oblation concludes, a light will burn symbolizing each offering Each time a lamp lights up, it wanes Bimbisara's power. The embrace weakens and helps us open the treasure. Then make all necessary arrangements. But there is a risk involved, Your Highness. Since you share Bimbisara's star, sign and blood, only you can break his aura. In the process you may also lose your strength and may even die. People faced atrocities in Bimbisara's times and are leading peaceful lives only now. Now they face problems again. I am ready to risk my life to help them. I must save this kingdom and its people. Bimbisara shall remain a great emperor in history. You are ready to sacrifice your life for people. What about the responsibility of the kingdom? Princess Ira who stood up to Bimbisara! She will be the crown princess. Chief Commander is not a mere servant. He should command and assume authority when the kingdom is in trouble. Bimbisara's power is complemented by Bhagira's efforts. That's why Trigartala became an invincible empire. Now someone escapes Bhagira's eyes, enters the palace, replaces Bimbisara and is now ruling the kingdom. What are you saying, Chief? This is unbelievable. A king who resembles our king? I move so close and yet I can't believe this. Chief! No one would believe when you say Devadatta replaced Bimbisara. But that's the absolute truth. -What are you going to do, Chief? Bhagira is the emperor of Trigartala from now. How treacherous! I shall inform the king. You are dead. My king! My king! My king! Are you in your bed chamber? My king! My king! I wonder what he is busy with. I am hungry. Let us have fruit. My King! Apple! Where did it come from? Who cares? I might as well eat it. What happened to the apple that fell on the mirror? Did it fall behind it? Has it vanished? Or has mirror swallowed the apple? What is this? -It's an apple, Dad. I can see. Can't you space out your bites? You gobble the whole thing like a buffalo. Where did you get this apple from? It has fallen out of the mirror. -I will kill you if I catch you lying. How can the apple fall out of the mirror? Watch it for yourself. Oho! Strange! Would you eat this apple? Or swallow it? Swallow it then! Ouch! My face! Argh! Dad! This must be some ogre. If we stay longer, it might swallow us. Let's run, Dad! So what Bhagira said was true. Did Devadatta use this mirror and send my king to the other world? My king! How unjust! I must get my king back to the kingdom. This conspiracy must be exposed. My king! I come to you with your sword as my defence. Hail, Bimbisara! Hail, Bimbisara! What a strange world this is? It looks so different. Look at these people and their dressing. They have covered even their noses! What a strange custom! Is my sneeze so powerful? Who knows? My king! My king! Have you seen Bimbisara? -How does he look? He is dark-skinned, sports a wavy moustache and very tall. Where is he? There is no one like that here. Get going. Wait! My King! My king! Where shall I look for you in this wild, strange world? My king! Bimbisara! Where's my King and how is he? Bimbi, take a look at these. What's this? -Details of those who attacked the girl recently. When we enquired deep, we came to know they don't belong here. We went to the hospital to talk to the survivors but they were in no condition to talk. This looks like a perfectly planned attack. Hello -I want to speak to Bimbisara. Bimbi! You have a call. Who is it? -Hello, Mr King! How are you? Who are you? Do we have to get acquainted? May be we do. The elder one went to the temple along with his wife. The old man is alone at home. The third one went out on some work. If they all have to stay alive till you go home, we have to get acquainted Mr King. Hey! If anything happens to my people, you won't stay alive. Cool down, Mr King. Cool, cool! I give you information and you give me warning. Where are you? -What's the hurry, Mr King? Just turn to your right and you will find the father of your favourite child. Try and save him. Rajeev! Hey! Are you relieved he has escaped? Ha ha ha! I averted it because there is still half minute left for the death time. But no one can avert this tragedy. Rajeev! Rajeev! Take care of the child. Rajeev! Rajeev! When I hear the fear in the voice of an emperor who startled history, it feels so good. What the hell do you want? I have been dreaming about you. Looking for you. Waiting for you. Wanting you to come and fulfil my dream. Finally I have found you. There is a vehicle by the side. Get into it and you will come to me straight. Come on! My King, to break the three restraints safeguarding the king's treasure, we have to perform these three rituals. An eternal torch burns symbolizing each of these. Only then can the ritual add its strength and open the doors to the treasure. We have initiated this ritual for the sake of people. Only good will come out of it. Go ahead. What did we do that you keep hounding us? You killed my son who wouldn't hurt a fly. I don't know what you did to the little one whom we brought up with utmost care. What do you want? Your only sin is to be the heirs of Bimbisara. And your sin today turned into a boon for us. You don't get it, do you? The one whom you worship like God, the one to whose ideals you are the inheritors, he is an emperor of whom history itself is proud, Bimbisara! When we were looking for him, we found you like a huge tree in a vast desert. Hey! How can you look for someone who doesn't exist in this world? And yet he crossed over time and entered this world. He saved the girl I abducted and became one of you. Sastri! Here comes Bimbisara who is going to establish the kingdom of your dreams. Take a look. You are right, Kethu. The history I have waited for is walking towards me. Yes, Mr King! This is the kingdom you had ruled over. Do you recognize this? You sealed this door with your own hands. What do you want? -The book of Dhanwantari. Yes. With no idea of its value, you threw the book into the treasure. Open the trove, get the book and hand it to me. Not possible.	-Not at all possible to take a 'no', Mr King. You may face me and save your family. But you won't save the girl. What did you do the kid? -Why do you panic, Mr King? Take a look that side. Baby! The child's blood carried the D40 virus that kills humans. It weakens her by the hour and kills her in 24 hours. There is no anti-dote in the world except in the book of Dhanwantari. Now you need it more to open the treasure and get the book. Without further delay, open the trove. My king! The first ritual is over. Please offer the oblations to Fire. What is happening? Why did the man who is supposed to break the chain, fly? Is he the real Bimbisara? -Of course. If he is Bimbisara indeed, why couldn't he open the treasure? Tell me, Kethu, tell me. He is Bimbisara. He is definitely Bimbisara. His is a history written by time. History never lies, Sastri. Something is wrong somewhere. Hey! I don't know where you would go or what you would do. Dhanwantari must be in my hands before sunset. Or the kid will die. Then God himself won't be able to save her. Your Majesty! The second ritual is complete. Please offer the oblations to the Fire. Handover that Dhanwantari by Sunset to me else the kid dies. "Life is gone into the hands of demons hissing" "When my cute moon is being a prey to Kethu" "Whom do I ask for what? You should shower blessings." Where is your god then? -He will come. When will he come? -If you light this lamp, He will come. I squashed the belief that day that light will bring God. Today, I plead you with the same belief. The life of my saviour is in danger now because of me. I don't know what to do or how to save her. Bimbisara never bowed before anyone. Never sought help. I beg you for the first time, Mother Goddess. Give me a chance to save the kid. After that, I am ready for any punishment you give me for all my misdeeds. “A relation said to give life for you” He looks like Bimbisara. My King! Bimbisara! It is King Bimbisara! Zubeida! -My King! What are you doing here? My King! Trigartala is waiting for you. The kingdom is in chaos, my King. How did you come here? -Through the mirror, my King. Through the mirror? -I know where it is. Let me take you to it, my king. Please come. This is the final segment of the ritual. As soon as this is complete, the chains will weaken and the door to the treasure will open. What are you doing, Bhagira? Devadatta! I am not sure if this ritual is going to save the people. But Bhagira's sword is sure going to kill you. You displaced Bimbisara and came in his place. Now I shall displace you and occupy your place. I shall rule over the empire of Trigartala. Bhagira! You seem to forget the punishment for treason. Once I am the king, who is going to punish me? Or will Bimbisara come to punish us from the other world? Bimbisara! Bimbisara! Bimbisara! -Hail, Bimbisara! (Praising Bimbisara) (Praising Bimbisara) So you have come in search of death across times, Bimbisara! Let me get rid of you both and make Bhagira the address of Trigartala Empire. Then or now...to touch the history of Trigartala, you have to first face the sword of Bimbisara. Trigartala is a champion of wars. Trigartala is not god written story for others to meddle and rephrase. It is the destiny decided by Bimbisara. If there is a man chivalrous enough, face me! That is Bimbisara's wielding. It is impossible for you to open the treasure, my king. Why? -The seal is controlled by the ritual. Devadatta started this to help the people in drought. Unless the ritual is complete, the treasure won't open. Then complete the ritual. Once it's complete, your death is imminent, my King. The girl I need to save there and the people here- Both suffered in my hands. I shall correct my mistake even if it costs me my life. Complete it. -Your Majesty! Devadatta! I tried to kill you. But you made me a great emperor in history. The wealth in the treasure shall remove the drought from the kingdom. Dhanwantari should regain its glory form ashes. From now, this kingdom and this book are your responsibility. I take leave. My King! What about the kid? I will lay my life if necessary but will save the girl. What is all this, Kethu? Is that Bimbisara and the treasure true or fiction? -It is true, Sastry. -Will he come? You captured his life in the kid. He will definitely come. Bimbisara is back, Kethu. He is back. My wish is fulfilled. I am going to rule the world. Dad! Your son has done it! Hey! I sent you for the book but why did you return empty handed? I realized the value of the book and so kept it in the safest place. You have no idea what it feels to lose something you value. I will kill the child and your family right before your eyes and make you experience the hurt. Immolate them! “I’ll be the brother to give anything if asked” “I’ll be a shadow as companion if called for” “A relation said to give life for you” “A relation said to give life for you” Dear! -Get up! Get up! Was it Bimbisara whom we worship as God that has stayed with us and protected us all these days? I can't believe it. The courage that patted on our shoulder in difficulty and filled this family with joy- When I know we are losing it now, how can I take it? Time is wicked. It showed us the truth in your last moments. Time distances people. Your presence with us is a boon. Losing you is our ill fate. The time you call wicked actually brought me to you. No one can go against destiny. I lived a life of wars and power. I won many battles as king. In the battle I fought overcoming that ego and authority. I won against myself. This is my real victory. Bimbi! Bimbi! Bimbi! Bimbi! Bimbi! Bimbi! Grandpa! Ask Bimbi to get up. Bimbi! Bimbi! Bimbi! No one is born yet with the courage to kill Bimbisara, Zubeida.
