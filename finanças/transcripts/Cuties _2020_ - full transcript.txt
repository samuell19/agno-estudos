NETFLIX PRESENTS What are you doing? Stop it! This is for Mama. Get down! Ismaël, careful. Ismaël, careful with my things from the market. No! Go on, go to your room. Mama! Go to your room. That's not my room. This is my room. Not here! No, that one is mine. -Stop it! -Calm down, you two. Come out. Ismaël, come on. Stop it, please. No, no. I'm not kidding. I have a lot to do. There. There you go. Look here. This room doesn't belong to anyone, okay? Slow down. You'll share this room. No! I'm always with him. Why can't I take this one? Be quiet. Ismaël, take this off your head. It's for girls. I don't care. Leave me alone. Our soul dies. It loses some of its light. How do we nourish it? Dear sisters, you can't imagine how happy the angels are to see us gathered here. Because the angels have heard us praise the name of Allah. They came to us, coming down from the sky to envelop us in their wings. That is the reason why women must be pious. Because in hell, they will be much more numerous than men will. That is why we must follow Allah's recommendations, because we are precious in the eyes of Allah. Do you know where evil shows itself? In these scantily clad women. We must remain modest. We must obey our husbands. We almost must be fearful as we educate our children. -Amen. -Amen. Thank you, sisters. Auntie. Are you settling in? Yes, Auntie. Thank you. It's a good housing project. Everyone gets along. What about you, Amy? Why, she's grown. How are you, then? Everything okay? Yes. Study hard at school so you can support your mother. Work hard. Okay? Do everything you can to please your mother. You see... these are like ghosts: only seen at night. You hear this?

It washes your sins away. How are you? We're fine. I miss you so much. Of course I think of you. And you? How are the children? I have something to tell you. My husband has married another woman. He's put another bed next to mine. That's right. He's taken a second wife. Right now he's in Senegal. He's coming back with her. You know... All I wish for them is that they marry for love. Goodbye. Call someone else. No, I can't. You have to. It's your duty. Auntie. Be a real woman. That's all I'm asking. Don't let people criticize you. Hello? Yes? This is Mariam. No. I just wanted to tell you that... my husband... he has taken a second wife. Right. Yes? Hello. I'm sorry. It was the connection. I'm sorry. The line was bad. There's always bad reception.

What were you doing? -We dance. -We're going to dance in a competition. We're going to be the bomb! -Totally! -What about you, do you dance? Can you dance? Of course she can. No, but I can learn.

If you carry on, I'll call the police. I know she's here. She's not here. To hell with both of you. You cleaned it? Wait. There. Good, he's gone. See you. PUBLISH Imagine if the guy peed in your mouth. You dummy, that's nature. Nature? You think that's how babies are made? That's gross. -She's making a weird face. -That means it's a rape. A rape? It can go through your whole body. The boy gets inside you. If it's a rape, it can come out of your mouth. No way. It's not long enough to reach your mouth. Depends on the boy. I've seen my brother naked. It wasn't big like this. Maybe your brother's isn't done growing. That's too much. It's as big as his head. Whoa, that's gross. Can't see a thing on your crappy phone. Do you have a brother? Yes, two. He's here! Quick! -Hey, stop it. -Come on. Toilet time. -Come on, hurry. -He's going to hear you. What's wrong with you?

We just need to rehearse. Where's the contest? Amy, Amy! Look! Ismaël! Ismaël! What the--? What are you doing? What the hell? I just wanted to make a pool. Don't do that. It's not lipstick.

Yes, it's Kim Kardashian, on my mother's head. Look! She's so hot! I'll do a runway show. You'd better go on a diet first. There's something missing. Go on, Yasmine. Do your runway show. -Go, Yasmine! -Go, Yasmine! -Who's that? -It's Yasmine! -Who's the best? -It's Yasmine! -Yeah! -Yeah! Cool! Go ahead, have fun. Look, a boob! I've found a boob for Yasmine.

Look at his face. -He just woke up. -He's so handsome. -Turn on your camera. -No! No way. Are you crazy? Say it doesn't work. No, it doesn't work. Tell him. "Give me a clue." I have an idea. Look... "I have big... -boo--" -No! "Boobs." -You're going too far. -Coumba! "Do you want to... touch them?" Look how he's blushing. -He looks like a tomato. -He's unsettled, poor thing. Are you serious? Go play with dolls. You're just a kid. Who are you calling kids? You're the kid, okay? You panicked when we said big boobs. You old lech! Why did you touch it? Are you nuts? Is your mom going to pay for the computer? Why turn on the camera? -What's going on here? -Get some help, okay? At least she didn't kill you. Calm down. She exposed me. What about the pre-selection dance? We'll dance with her, but we just don't speak to her. Easy. You don't care about Yasmine, us, the routine, or getting pr-eselected. You're overreacting. It wasn't mean. She was just messing with you. She turned the camera on. Oh, come on. Have you calmed down? Fuck off, bitch. Are you nuts? You're calling me a bitch? What do you want, huh? What is it you want? You're going to get it! -What do you want? -Calm down. What do you want? -You're totally insane! -What do you want? -Calm down! -What's wrong with you? Calm down, stop it! Calm down. Whoa, Angelica, let her go! Are you nuts? You, over there. Yasmine, principal's office. Stupid! What did you call me? What did you say? You, go over there. I said "Stupid--" Go over there! -I'll kill you! -Stop talking. Angelica, stop-- You, over there. I'm dancing with you. -What? -I'll replace Yasmine. You can't even dance. There's no time to teach you. The pre-selection's on Sunday. Cool. You know the routine. But I don't know if the girls will be okay with it. What are you doing? You good, Amy? What do you want? Is Angelica here? Angelica! -Angelica! -What, dumbass? Excuse me? What are you doing? Stop it! -Stop! -Kids, I'm trying to sleep! Angelica keeps bugging me. Damn liar. -Your friend's here. -You're dead. I've been dancing since I was little. My mom would say I was already dancing in her belly. But now I never see my mom or my dad anymore... because of their work at the restaurant. I hardly see them. They say that... I'm a bad daughter... that I can't do anything. But people like me. Right, Amy? People like me? Everyone says I'm crazy. Even my mom and dad don't know I have a gift. I dreamed they came to see me dance and said they liked it. They say if you have the same dream three times, it comes true. It's two times so far. Do you have dreams? -Yes. -What is it? My father never coming back. IT'S ANGELICA PRE-SELECTION AT 10 Aminata? Amy, wake up. Wake up, honey. It's time. Today I'll teach you how to be a woman. We're going to cook for your father's wedding. Already? You couldn't possibly do everything in one day. You're going to peel all these onions. Hold this well. And then chop them up in very small pieces. All by myself? Of course, by yourself. And then cut the tomatoes, and crush the chilies. I'll help you to make the fritters. Amy, I'm ready! I'll be right there. Come on. Amy, what are you doing? Keep it on your head. We're not in the village. You talk back. Amy, listen to me. Amy? Amy, come back here! Hey! Hey! Amy! BIG DANCE CONTEST MOV'UP It's okay. Start over. Thanks. That was great. We'll let you know. Thanks. Next! It's your fault too. Your stupid friend. I want to kill her. Where were you? Every child I've raised obeyed me, except for you. If I tell your mother, what is she going to do? What are we going to do with you? You only do what you please. That's nothing. All women go through that. When I was your age, I was engaged. I was barely taller than you. A few years later, they washed me, dressed me, and covered me... in a white cloth, from my head down to my feet. Then they took me to my husband to get married. When he lifted... the white cloth covering me, he presented me to his friends, his guests, his family. It was a grandiose wedding. I wish that God... grant you the same destiny. Come. I'll show you what to do. You're a woman now. Where were you? You took off. Speak! At home. My aunt locked me up. -Your what? -You were locked in a cellar? I'll kill you if we lose. She's such a liar. I swear to you. The routine was great. -You're a jerk. -The judges loved it. -Yeah? How do you know? -But you didn't go. Why do you say that? You're weird. -I was late. -Late? She just freaked out. You don't take this seriously. -I swear, the routine was-- -You're such a liar. -I swear! -Let go of her! Let go! Fuck you, I'm not a liar. -I swear to God! -You're the biggest liar ever. The door was locked. I did rehearse. Look, the baby is crying. Leave me alone! -No way. -I'm sorry. The judges really liked it. Why are we listening? Let's get out of here. Let go of me. -I believe her. -I'm out of here. So? Still nothing. No wonder. We messed up big time. Okay. Let's go. Get a move on. Quick! -What is this thing? -What's this? Okay, girls. It's real simple. You got in without paying. Give me your parents' numbers and I'll call them. We didn't know we had to pay. The door was open. -Sure. -Anyway, we don't have parents. Right. We're just sisters. We're orphans. That's enough bullshit. Have compassion. We're orphans. Knock it off. Okay, we're out of here. Where are you going? -Hey! Let go! -Calm down. Let go of me! No, I won't. Stop groping me, you child molester! You're groping her, seriously? We're children. We're going to call our lawyers. Give me your parents' numbers. What's going on in here? Your buddy's been groping us. No, that's not what's going on. These young ladies came in through the back door. Now I'm asking for their parents' numbers, they're telling me tales and calling me pedophile because I grabbed her arm. Let's call the cops. -We're selected! -They're making fun of us. Call the cops. We've been selected! This is no laughing matter. Please, sir. We're dancers and we're going to a competition in the park. If you call the police, we can't go. But I'm a dancer too. You should lose weight. Honest, we're dancers. Look. Go, go, go! Go, Amy! Go, Amy! Go on, get out of here. -I don't want to see you again. Get out! -See you later! Seriously? We're in the finals! You aced it with your dance. We're going to hypnotize them. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! How many do I get? I don't know. You do it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... nine, ten. Yeah! She's showing some cleavage. You rock. All right... totally. People flipped over you. Did you see all the likes we got? Insane! You rock, girl. Who's a hit? -It's Amy! -Who is it? Who is it? It's Amy! -Who is it? -It's Amy! Hey, calm down! Little man's in a hurry. Little man... Snotty little dwarf. Look who's there. The Sweety-Swaggs. And Toilet Time? Forget about it. I did nothing. Whoa, what the--? Let go of her! Get off her! Let her go now! -Check out the panties! -What are these raggedy undies? Plays big, but gets clothes from the trash. Okay, that's enough. Get off her! Fuck off! Give me that stupid phone! Come on, girls! Quick, let's go! They're crazy. Come on. Hey! Where did you get this toy? -Where did you get this? -Someone gave it to me in the park. Look at me. Darling. Where did you get the toy? I'll give it back. Tell me. Speak to me. Where did you get it? Tell the truth. Amy bought stuff for me and her friends. Stop lying. Amy, will you tell the ghosts? Will they kill me? Mama! Mama! Mama. Mama. You scared me. I'm okay, darling. I'm all right. Let's go ahead and eat. Amy, it can't go on like this. Everybody's talking about this video. Everybody's seen your undies. They're saying we're kids. They're all talking about your damn undies. We need to do something. Your mother's resting. She's better. That's my phone. You had it all along? We looked for it together. You said-- -Please give it back! I need it. -Why? It's my phone! Enough! I won't give it back. -Give it back! -No! What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Give it back! -Let go of me! -Give it back! I said let go. -Give it back! -Let go of me! Amy! My phone! Open the door! Amy, my phone! I'm not leaving here! My phone! Open the door! Open up, I said! Come on! I don't have time for this. Hey! PUBLISH Listen to me! Come on, open the door! This is bullshit. Using a compass, place N symmetrical to N in relation to the straight line. Is everyone good? Everyone's done? Good. Amy, come up here, please. Malcolm, what was that? To the principal's! She's the one who posts nude pictures online. -What's this garbage? -You shut up! -Shut your trap! -Are you the slut or is it me? Be quiet. I'll call your parents, both of you. That's enough. I'm calling your parents. She's the one... What's wrong with you? What game are you playing, Amy? Where do you come from? Who are you, Amy? Aminata! You lie to me! You steal from me! You attack your classmates and behave like a whore! What do you do in the neighborhood? The things I've heard! What are you playing at? You want to humiliate me, your mother? Aminata! And your father who blames me for everything! -And who takes another wife! -Leave her alone. -Leave her alone. -You want to make me suffer more? Who are you, Amy? -Give me that. -You're not my daughter anymore! -I'm going to kill you! -Go get some water. You haven't started? No. What's going on? You know very well. Because of your stupid photo we've got a bad reputation now. -Happy? -Frankly, you've gone too far. If I'd done that, my mom would've sent me back to the village. Who cares? We'll show them we're real women. Now we're in the same boat as you. Did you even see the comments on your photo? Did you know people are asking us to pose like you? We're not stripping. We're not you. It doesn't matter. What matters is that we win the contest. Wake up. We have to rehearse. I don't care. I'm dancing. Come on! Have you gone nuts or what? What are you doing? Come on. Give me back the phone. -Give it back! -Get off me! -Stop it! -Let's go! Come on. -Let go of me! -Come dance, Coumba. -Jess, come on. -Let go of me! -Come on! Do the steps! -Stop it now! Let go of her. You're ruining everything! Dance! Do something! I'm sick of your moods. -Come on. -Get some help. Let's go, girls. How are you? Let me do this. I know what you're going through with your husband... is very difficult. But God has never imposed on women more than they could bear. If your burden is too heavy, you have the right to leave this marriage. But know this: There is no devil or evil spirit here. I'm going to go now. No, thank you. Keep your money. -Yasmine in da house! -Oh, yeah! Hey, how are you? Hurry up over there or it's detention! Amy, I want to stay friends with you but, honestly, I can't in front of them. And the contest? Give it up. Stop now. You don't dance with us anymore. Enough. It's over. Let go. You're hurting me. You're hurting me. Amy! LONG LIVE THE NEWLYWEDS! Amy? Amy, aren't you getting ready for the wedding? Not even an answer. Please make as much noise as you can for the Sweety-Swaggs! If you please! Thank you!

You stand here. We'll call you, okay? We'll wait for Yasmine. She'll be here. There's no time left. She has to dance with us. She's actually better than Yasmine. True. She's better. Come on. -All right. -Let's hustle. -Who's that? -The Cuties! -Who's that? -The Cuties! -Who's the best? -The Cuties! Let's have a big round of applause for the Pinkies! Thank your audience. Thank you. And right now, we're going to welcome the C. U. T. I. E. S... They've got wings. They're going to soar and make you shiver. Give a thunderous round of applause for... -The Cuties! -Let's do it, guys. Amy? Mama! Mama? Where were you? What do I see? The clothes of a whore! Who told you to wear this? Auntie. Leave her alone. Why should I? Look how she's dressed! A respectable person's child wouldn't wear this. -Leave my daughter alone. -I won't leave her alone. Go and put on your dress... for your father's wedding. Leave my daughter alone now, Auntie! Mama. Please don't go. Come on, then. You know... you do not have to go.
