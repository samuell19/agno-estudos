Perfect Obedience: "You act and think like him who asks you to do things, as the one whom you love; you are a stick with no will, like a corpse" I take this opportunity to express my feelings of highest esteem, His Holiness Benedict XVI Holy Father Yes, yes, I know it will be difficult, I know it will take time. Sure. Count on me. Before I created you in your mother's womb, I knew you. Before you were born... I dedicated and destined you to be a prophet of the nations. Children, let's eat. Julian. Let's eat. Will you bless the food? Bless us, Oh Lord, and these spices we receive from your divine goodness. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Lord, we thank you for calling one of our children to serve you. We ask you to always enlighten him. - Amen. - Amen. And for Julian, that he does well at the seminar. - Amen. - Amen. Virgin Mary, give us strength to not miss him. Amen. Hey, all closer together. Closer. That's it. Closer, man. There, perfect. Come on. - Ready? - Yes. - Everybody watch the camera. - The camera, the camera! - Say Cheese. - Cheese! I'll move back. Don't move. Father Robles! - Welcome Mario. - Joaquín, good to see you again, man. - How are you? Give me that. - Family day, right? Thank God, yes. When did we last meet? - Was it at Carlos' party? - Two years. You were just 2 feet tall and now look, you're taller than Dad. About this tall. Thank you. And how do you feel? Good. Good. Although we'll miss him, we know that he'll be in good hands. What better hands than God's. Don't you think? My mother told me that a priest in the family is better than a doctor in the house. And she was right. Are you excited? Yes. Really? Yes. You'll see, you're going to have so much fun. You'll meet new friends, know different countries. And you know what's best? You'll save souls. That, not anyone can. Behave. Eh? And do everything they tell you. Don't put your hand where it shouldn't be. Be good. Lola! Take care, my love. You have all your stuff? Let's go. - Ms Rosa, good to see you. - Delighted. A pleasure to have you back with us, bringing new seminarians. This time we were lucky in the Bajio, my land. Children, this is father Galaviz, he'll be your father-teacher. - Hello, Father. - Hello, how are you? Hi, welcome. Welcome. This lovely woman is María Rosa Alcérreca, our beloved benefactor. Such cute boys. Mrs. Alcérreca helps several of our seminarians as their godmother. Everything for Christ's Crusaders and father Angel. Father Lomeli, Professor Romero, please. I'd like to introduce... the father was just ordained as priest. Just unpacked coming from Rome. Thank God, father. Welcome. - And Professor Romero will still take... one year? - One year, Father. One year to become a priest. God willing, it will be so. Here, we can have no women. They have very long hair. Let's have their hair cut. Bermudez, Jimenez, help them. Is this yours? Julian... Your teddy bear? Not too short. Ay, he has beautiful hair! Julian Santos. This is your bed, son. Bernardo Urrutia. - René Gómez. - Here. That's it. And Raul Ponce, the one in the corner. Finish unpacking, dress in your cassocks and I'll wait for you in the dining room. Okay? Yes, father. Sounds good. - What you got there? - Cookies. - Will you give me one? - Yes. Where do you think the bear should sleep? - In the crib. - In the crib. Goodbye, friend. Good. Well, you heard the father. Change your clothes and meet us in the dining room. These are not vacations, do it now. We're very happy because from now on, dear children, you are part of our family. And if you want to be true Christ's Crusaders you must become the image of our dear, of our beloved founding father, Father Angel de la Cruz. I'm very happy, very moved. My heart, like that of God, our Lord, is full of joy... to see these brave youngsters... coming to serve him and his Legion today. You'll soon realize that things that are normal here, even virtuous, out there people see them as crazy. But pay no heed to what they say out there. I want you to know that when you feel sad or distressed... we are here... I'm here to give advice. Welcome, children. This is your new home. And we are your new family. Are they your brothers and sisters? Yes. And my cousins. I have no sisters. Why don't you carry the book the way I told you? Looks like you're carrying chili and tomatoes, son. I said this goes here. Look at your brothers. - Ave Maria Purisima. - Conceived without sin, Father. How long since your last confession? Two days, Father. I want you to confess your sins. Yes, father. We thank you, Lord, for this food we will share. It's a sign of peace, joy, fraternity. Amen. Amen. Remember that the worst danger for a Crusader is slander, which means speaking bad of others. And especially about a superior. So if any of you has reason to suspect or accuse a Christ's Crusader, you can only tell a superior in rank, otherwise it'll be the worst of sins. This sin is the most obscene and goes against the spirit of Christ. That's why we must loath it. That's why we must detest it. Alberto. Alberto. ♪ Ave Maria ♪ Go to your classroom, no talking. No talking. Silence. Why I want to be a Christ's Crusader. Let's see. Who can tell me why you want to be a Christ's Crusader? Julian? - To save souls. - To save souls, yes! First reason, fine. Reasons, motives. Reasons. You want it? Here. What was that noise? What happened? - What were we saying? - To save souls. Not here, not yet. Calm down. Quiet. You'll see how things are here. Here I want you, here, in the eyes. What, weren't you the macho? Don't look elsewhere. Here. Hey! What is this? Everybody out. Get going! Julian, not you. What happened? You can't allow being hit or abused that way. You're not able to feel anger, rage in your heart? I'm talking to you. - Julian. - Yes, Father. When you talk to someone, raise your head and look into his eyes. Prove that you are a brave young man. Yes, father. Louder. Yes, father. Is that all the passion that you have? Loudly. - Yes, father. - Louder. - Yes, Father. - Yell, dammit! Shout! Shout what comes out of your heart. What do you feel? Don't cry, Julian. Don't cry. Come on. Yes, father. - Yes, Father! - Louder! - Yes, Father! - Good! You see? Nothing happens. It's fine to express your feelings. Do you think Jesus Christ, Our Lord, had done what he did if he didn't have the courage to show he's the Son of God? How do you feel? Better? Good. Listen here. I don't want to see you letting anyone abuse you this way. No matter who you are facing. Do you understand me? Yes, father. I'm afraid. It's natural, but very soon you'll begin to feel that this is your home... and that we are like your parents and siblings. To remove the fear, there's nothing better than entrusting yourself to God, Our Lord, and Our Lady. I need you to come here every Monday at 5PM to get spiritual help. I absolve you of all your sins in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Amen. - Go in peace. God wants to do great things for you. I love you very much. Alberto. Alberto. Now, dear brothers, I invite you to participate in the foot washing that reminds us of the love, humility, and service of our Lord Jesus Christ. Before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him, And Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, that he came from God and was returning to God, he gets up from the dinner table, takes off his mantle, and taking a towel, wraps it to his waist. He then pours water into a basin and begins to wash his disciples' feet, wiping them with the towel he wrapped to his waist. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, dost thou wash my feet?" Jesus answered him, "What I do thou knowest not now but later you'll understand." Peter said to him, "No, you will never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I don't wash you, you have no part with me." Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not just my feet but also my hands and my head." What sins have you committed? Impure acts and thoughts. What kind of thoughts, son? About women, father. Just thinking about them naked. And you got excited? Yes, Father. Have you touched yourself down there? Our Lord instructed us to spread his word around the world... and to defend our truth before everybody. Yes, Father, with your help and the Lord's we're sure to succeed. It has already been said, nobody here runs away. We are going to spread it and nobody is going to detain us. Pay attention here. "Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to?" The man replied, "The woman you put with me gave me fruit off the tree and I ate." And God said to the woman, "What hast thou done?" And Eve said, "The serpent beguiled me and I ate." Then God said to the serpent, "By doing that, cursed are you above all livestock and all the wild animals. I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between your offspring and hers. She... will crush your head while you shall bruise her heel." And he told Eve, "I'll multiply your suffering in pregnancy and you'll bring forth children in pain. You will always need a man, and he shall rule over you." - Alberto, you sing so bad! - Shut up. Today I had bad thoughts and performed the solitary sin. Do you know what the solitary sin is? - No. - Well, on your own, with "Manuela". Julian, up straight. Great, Julian, a goal. - How are you, my sons? - Fine, thank you. I'm glad to see you play sports. A healthy mind in a healthy body. - Who scored the goal, son? - Julian. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Father. Go on. I don't want to distract you. Staying with our beloved Father Angel is a great opportunity. You must promise me that you'll behave. I promise, father. You give me your word as a man and as a Crusader? I give my word as a man and a Crusader. Very well. Never in my career I met another child who obtained the level of obedience that you reached. Who lead me so softly on the path that goes from teacher to man. They just stopped in the attempt, between confusion and eagerness to meet what I was commanding them. - Thanks for bringing him, Father. - You're welcome. Well, I have to go. You're home. Do you know why I choose you? When I was washing your feet I received a sign from heaven. God in his infinite goodness decided to put you under my care for this year. I don't want you to tell anyone what I'm telling you, because it's something special between you and me. Did it ever happen to you that somebody provokes a feeling... you thought was only intended for the Lord our God? It's a feeling that doesn't happen each day. Sometimes not even in a lifetime. It happened to me with you. Only with you, not with anyone else. Come, I'll show you your room. You remind me of those kids who came to Jesus. That's what I felt. This is your room. You gave up your family, but you did well. Because as Jesus said, "He who does not detest his father and mother, his brothers, his wife and children, can not be my disciple." Well, that about women and children was not about you, but about one of his apostles. Now the Crusaders are your new family and I'm your father and you're my son. And I need you to put all your confidence in me. Yes, beloved father. From now on you'll give up your parents' surname as sign of resignation of your family. Repeat after me, "Yes, I renounce the name my parents gave me from today and forever." Yes, I renounce the name my parents gave me from today and forever. Kneel. Close your eyes. I baptize you as "Sacramento Santos", and you'll respond to that name until the day of your death. Per secula seculorum. Amen. From now until the purification on next Lent, you'll become my shadow and my mirror and perform all my commands... and learn what I know and be the mirror of my words and my deeds. Per secula seculorum. Amen. I thank you for choosing me. You are the chosen of God. To reach perfect obedience, I'll force you to feel pleasure even of what you dislike. You'll know what you most hate and scares you, which is yourself. That's the only way you will achieve a final transformation. Imperfect Obedience of the first grade. You do things out of love for he who asks you to. I was attentive for months, observing you. Good day, beloved father. I would like to give account of the day that you finally... would yield your will to mine for good, so you would begin to wish only for... what I want from you. Let's see, hold on. - Well, well, come on, show us. - Yes, right away. Look. Just look at this. Oh, the 10 commandments! Yes, but you don't know the 10 commandments. Look. Let's see. Just look at those buttocks! She looks like Osmar's mother. It's true. See? She has better buttocks than Bernardo. But not better than yours. You know what? I have a surprise. Just look. Come on, you light it. No, no, I won't go for that. - Come on, smoke it! - Aren't you the macho here? Yes I am. I just wanted to be begged. - He can't stand anything! - This tastes horrible! I'll teach you how. This guy's the expert! - Come on, give me that. - No, you're still young. You need to grow. - Let's go. - No, take it easy. Stay here, we are very fine here. We'll dance the Jarabe Tapatío... the party will get better. - Maybe he doesn't like it? - How come? Look how he gets red, and you white. See, there aren't guys like this at Bajio. - Tell me. - They were smoking and laughing. What else? They were looking at a magazine with naked women. Did you look at it? I also saw an adult magazine. With photographs of men or women? I asked if the magazine you read had pictures of men or women. Women, father. And when you see the photographs, do you touch yourself? Do you masturbate? I masturbate, father. When you masturbate, do you think about men or women? I think about the Servants of Mary, father. That's too bad. You shouldn't think of the Servants that way. Very bad. Try not to. The woman is a temptation to have very bad thoughts. God sees everything. We can't fool Him about those disgusting acts. Aren't you ashamed? Jiménez, what are you laughing at? Do you find it funny what I'm saying? Come over here. Undress. As God brought you into the world, so you'll feel what Adam felt when he was expelled from paradise. And you'll learn to respect your superiors. Kneel here. Stretched arms. Quichas, help me. The heaviest Bibles. For your classmate. He'll hold them, and if he lowers his arms he'll face worse. What happened, Alberto? - We were just playing, father. - Playing? What were you playing? Nothing, father. Just looking at a magazine with naked women. What else, Alvaro? We were also smoking. What else? We were groping each other, father. Groping? What kind of groping? Don't lower your arms, or you'll face worse. We groped each other's butts. You too, Bernardo? Yes, father. Just a little bit. A little bit. A little bit is mediocre's ways and that's what you are. Mediocre. Bleached graves, hypocrites who want to go to hell. You'll go to hell. You have no idea how hard it is for me to punish you, but I have to. 30 days cleaning the bathrooms and the sacristy. Get out, all of you. Not you. You wait for me there. And you too. And you, is this the way God brought you into the world? In underwear? Sit down, son. Here. Remaining silent is not the same as being discreet. And now you have been discreet. Never forget that under any circumstances, you have the right to report to a superior. Jesus said, "Whoever is not with me is against me." And today I would like to give special gratitude to our friend and hostess, Mrs. Alcérreca. Thank you. The last time I was with His Holiness, he asked me to thank you deeply for everything you have done for us. And to let you know that he himself is interceding for the salvation of your soul and those of your family. And I brought a small gift I hope you'll keep forever with much fondness. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Cheers to you all for being here. Cheers. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. Mrs. Cristina represents the Mondragon group and is here to help us. - Madame Cristina, it's a pleasure to meet you. - The pleasure is mine, Father. The audience with the Holy Father is already arranged. It's settled. A private audience. There I'll take the chance to tell His Holiness of these entrepreneurs and politicians who commended me to invite him to Mexico. They will finance everything. It's a great gift to the Mexican people. A votre santé. Cheers, Brother. Cheers. We've got the money for the order. God bless you. God bless you. And this is for my godson. What do you say, son? Bless you, godmother. I will pray for you. With this I'd even be pleased to be punished. Serve me. How funny! Serve me. - I'm not your Servant. - No, for a Servant nun you miss some attributes. Well, we have a new member. We have a new member in the drunken's club. - Let's see... Sacramento. - Don't worry, it's the blood of Christ. - Here. Nothing bad will happen, right? - No, nothing will happen, I tell you, it's the blood of Christ. Bravo. Welcome. Welcome to the club. A toast to friendship and... well, whatever it is, let's drink on it now. Don't spill it. Can't you see we're short of it? No wonder why they became priests! Jimenez. You're such a pig! Really, were you holding on to Our Lady? I don't agree that priests marry. I can't imagine a priest saying a Mass after being with a woman. For me that's the end of the Church. Let that be clear. Come in, come in. What's up? To see you with women makes me angry. That means that you're spying on me. And that you doubt my good intentions. And I can't tolerate that. Come over here. Here. Two hands... up there. So you to learn to respect your elders. Ask God for forgiveness. Ask God for forgiveness. - Ask God for forgiveness! - God, forgive me. Louder. Ask God for forgiveness! - God, forgive me. - I can't hear you! God, forgive... - Louder! - God, forgive me! God, forgive me. Go to your room. I don't want to see you. Sacramento! No! No! You shall worship the Lord, your God, and only Him you shall serve. Good day, beloved father. I'll tell you one thing, and engrave it in your mind. While living in this house, dedicate yourself to do what's required... and otherwise try to go unnoticed. As if you don't exist. Dismissed. - Sacramento, what happened? Let's play. - What happened? Beloved father. This damned pain which condemns me to suffering. Go get Father Noel. Let him know what's going on. Get him to bring Alberto or any of the boys. Son. Son. Son, good thing the Lord made you come to relieve this pain! I prayed so much today! Leave us alone, Father. Let's go. Son. Beloved father. Why do you get these pains? It's a test God bestows on me son, but I'm okay now. What did Alberto do to alleviate it? Horrible things are happening, Mom. I swear. These aren't fantasies, Mom. I need your help. Please come. Please come, Mom. Please. Beloved father. Beloved father. This damned pain has me condemned to suffering. I don't understand why I get it so often. Do you want some tea? No, son. Sit. It's God who sent this pain to test me. It's my seminal ducts, they are very narrow. I've seen many specialists and they say I have to empty my testicles to heal. I even spoke about it with His Holiness and he authorized some of my seminarians to help me when the pain is as deep as now. Help me. Help me. Turn off the light, it hurts me. Lie down. Like this, don't fear. Here, like this. Like this. I'll be back at 2 PM. Your Father Angel de la Cruz. I told them not to expect you in class. Imperfect obedience of the second degree. You should love to do what you are asked to. I want to go home, Mom. I really want to leave here. Father Angel touched me, Mom. I don't believe you. Mama, what have I done to you? Pardon the interruption. Alberto, will you allow us to talk to your mom, please? Thank you. Why do you think he invented that story? Dear lady, do you think we could lie about something so serious? You'll see Alberto will soon call to tell you he's happy, and you'll realize that he made up everything he said. - These are fantasies! - It's true. All teenagers make things up. - Trust us. - We are here to help. You know he's a good boy? You've always had good taste in choosing them. Father, the food is ready. Thank you, daughter. Coming. The Archbishop asked me, obviously "off the record" that if you do it, be sure you do it with a woman. The risk of a scandal is less. There's always one available. Let's eat. Very well. Now, let's do it. Don't laugh, focus. Let's see. Give me your hand. Now this way, open it. Don't look at it. Look into my eyes. Give me your hand. Very well. For every theological virtue... hope and charity are born. Repeat after me. Don't laugh, it's serious. "I swear by my love for God, love for the Crusaders and love for you, that whatever happens will remain our secret." Repeat. I swear by my love for God, love for the Crusaders and the love of you, that whatever happens will remain our secret. Don't laugh. Look into my eyes. To happiness, and so we don't forget. Done. Dance. Dance. Try it on. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - I spoke ill of a superior, Father. - Whom of, son? Of Father Angel de la Cruz. Why? I don't feel good about what we are doing, father. You know speaking ill of a superior is the biggest sin a Crusader can commit? - Yes, Father. - Then don't do it again. We are your family, and you don't speak ill of your family. Look, what I mentioned before. My grandfather gave it to me. It's cool, isn't it? It looks just like father Angel's one. The skull is cool. You like it? I asked if you like it! Whatever, because it's mine. Let's go. I'll catch you in a while. Jesus' love for us is greater than all human misfortune. I want you to promise me one thing. I don't want you to be with anyone but me. You didn't understand a thing, did you? I belong to no one. And we can't afford these desires of possession. Our sole mission is to guide as leaders. Learn it by heart. Over here. You don't know how much I'll miss you. Perfect Obedience of the third grade. You think and act like the one you love, you don't have a will of your own anymore. Answer me with your hand on your heart, if you ever again felt the delights you experienced under my care. The only thing that you might reproach me about these times, is that it was too short. But you know, our affair could not last any longer. For if it were so, it would have ended gradually, corrupting and eroding itself, as the most beautiful things of this world wear down when their time is over. Sacramento. Come here. Turn around. There's no one here. Let's go. Let's go to the rock. You already reached perfect obedience and that will never leave you. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Go with God. Go in peace. Thou, the most beloved and indispensable of the sacraments. The most perfect obedience of all is one in which, as in the perfect obedience of the third grade, you act and think as the one you love. Furthermore, the one you love also thinks and acts the way you do, because he truly loves you above all things. Up to the end you've done what I wanted you to do. And until the end I have done what you wanted me to do. Based on a true story. Transcription and translation by jpf Editing by Subransu
