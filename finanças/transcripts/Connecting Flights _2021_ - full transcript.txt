I have myself full confidence that if all do their that they'll all do their duty, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war and to outlive the menace of tyranny. We'll defend to our death our native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. We shall go onto the end. We shall fight in France. We shall fight on the seas and oceans. We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. We shall never surrender. There is, perhaps, no condition more confusing or unwelcome than grief. There's no escaping it. This is a river that must be crossed, a desert that must be traversed. The mountain that must be climbed. One day we will be able to look back and truly appreciate that Wendy is in a better place, resting forever in the arms of the Lord. Amen. And now I believe Wendy's granddaughter would like to say a few words. Thank you so much, everyone, for coming. I know Nana would have been thrilled to see you all, though she probably would have scolded you for being in church when there's a match on. Growing up, I always knew that I had the nicest, sweetest grandmother in the world, but what I didn't know was that she was also strong and fierce and resilient. I never met the Wendy that got kicked out of her parent's house and had to learn to make it on her own. I never met the Wendy that worked nights for 20 years so that my dad could go to school. Sweetness and gentleness are wonderful qualities, but sometimes I wish that I had met the other Wendy. The one that kicked such serious ass. And I'm grateful for that Wendy and I wish that I could have known her. Well, that was a weird speech, Claire bear. Thanks, Kev. Where is Gordy? Wasn't sure if he should come. He barely knew Nana and I thought it might just upset him. Malcolm took him for the day. You let the wanker take him? Praise be to God, Mrs Crabtree. Don't call him a wanker, we're not supposed to do that. Why not? I don't know, health? It's all the rage now. You're not supposed to hate each other, you're supposed to consciously uncouple. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Honestly, I miss him. Well you shouldn't. He's a wanker. Who's the suit talking to dad? I don't know. Are you coming home? Yeah, Malcolm's dropping off Gordy. We'll stay in the spare room. I'm planning an early night, though, so don't let me have any wine. And the dandelions. Oh my God. Every spring, more of them, just like a carpet. I bet it drove her neighbors mental. Oh, it did. She would never let them touch them. And then in the spring, dandelion fluff everywhere. Beauty in all things, that was Nan. Oh God. To Nana Barlow. All: To Nana Barlow. Is Gordy in bed? Hours ago. Poor bunny. I wish he'd got more opportunities to meet his Nan. Me too. Right, dad, do tell. Did she leave you any money? Kevin. What? She wrote me a letter. Apparently she wrote it just before she passed away. Why? She wanted me to know more about your grandfather, my father. It's a bit late, isn't it? What does it say? My dear son, I have never told you much about your father, mostly because... It's okay. It's her handwriting. Here, dad, let me. My dear son. I have never told you much about your father, mostly because there's not been much to tell. You know that he was a pilot in the air force. You know that his name was Gordon, but there were two things that I did not tell you. He was a Canadian and his name was Devereux. I used to ask her what his last name was. She would just say your name is Donald Barlow and you should be proud of it. You didn't know he was Canadian. I just assumed he was RAF. I used to invent stories that he was from Wales or Scotland or came from a titled family. Was it just a fling? More than that, I think. I didn't notice it when I was younger, but looking back, she always talked about him like they were married. Were they? No, never. That's why she got kicked out, when her parents learned about the pregnancy. I only ever had one letter from him and it was a postcard. Let me read it. I can do it. My dear Wendy, I have to tell you that I'm on the move again. We have to help finish things off with Japan. I'll write when I get there and as soon as I can. All my love, Gordon. And she never heard from him again? Not that I know of. Ahem... He was a fine man, Donald. He would have been so proud of you, and you of him. I wish life had been different and that you two could have known each other. With much love, mom. - That's weird. - Claire. No, I mean, it's a beautiful note. Very romantic, very sad. But why wait until now to give it to you? Maybe she, he didn't want to discuss it. It was probably a very painful memory. Maybe she wanted me to find him. Don, be realistic. Yeah, what are the chances this guy's even still alive? 23rd of May, 1945. May... And he went to the Pacific. You know, I have a friend at the Kew archives who could probably- Somebody stop her. Claire, this isn't one of your human interest stories. This is your father's life. He's right though. What if Nan wanted dad to go looking? Don't be absurd. There's a postscript on this. Your father used to say that when he got back to Canada, the first thing he would do is pack his tent and head west to go camping in the mountains. Why would she write that if she didn't want you to go looking? She's giving you a clue. Gordy, what are you doing up? Let's get you some water and put you back to bed, okay? Come on. Let's go. There, you cozy? Did you have a good day with your dad? Or did you miss your old mom too much? Can dad come and pick us up in the morning? We're going to stay with grandma and grandpa for a couple of days, but that will be fun, right? Hey, I love you so much. Goodnight, Bunny. Is he okay? Oh, he'll be fine, it's his mom who's a mess. Par for the course. What are you looking at? There's an organization set up for people like me, whose fathers were visiting serviceman. Connection Closure. It, it sounds like a scam. Well, the BBC covered them. But you have so little to go on and you've always assumed your father had died. Why would Wendy let you think any different? Maybe she thought it was better to have a dead parent than one who would just walk out on you. No, Claire, I didn't mean... No, of course not. It's okay. Gordy knows his dad loves him. Besides, it's different now, anyway. That's right, lots of children these days only have one parent. In the '40s and '50s- Did Nana have any boyfriends growing up? As far as I know, there was just him. Gordon Devereux. I think we should let sleeping dogs lie. Mom. Dad should call these connection people. What's the harm in asking? I don't like it. Well, it's not a democracy, mom. It's up to dad. What do you want to do? I'll need some time to think about it. I just don't understand why you're so worried about it. What's the worst that could happen? The worst that could happen? That's really good, Gordy. What are you building? Nice. The worst that could happen is your father gets his heartbroken. Not if he finds Gordon Devereux. Claire... Imagine that you're an old man at the end of your days and one day you're sat at home and the doorbell rings. You open it and there's some person standing there, a woman say, and she says, "Hi, you don't know me," but I'm your daughter. "Fancy having a cup of tea together?" What would you do? I'd slam the bloody door in her face. Mom. Cheeky bitch, DNA does not make you family. I just don't understand how you could not want to dive headfirst into this. I mean, the intrigue, the romance. Claire, I'm not the journalist. You dive in all you want. I'm going to focus on keeping your father happy. Maybe keeping him happy means letting him have a parent that's still alive. If your father knows what's good for him, he will forget all about this. Mom I... Try an orange one or a red one. Hello? Yes. Oh, perfect. No, that would be wonderful. Yes, perfect. Thank you. Thank you so much. Connection and Closure originated five years ago. It was my mother who started the whole thing off. Like you, she was searching for her father. Did she find him? She did. That's wonderful. Isn't that wonderful? How many people are in a similar situation? Fathers who came and went during the war. In the UK? 25,000, another 10,000 in the Netherlands. My own mother is a US citizen, but even there, she's not alone in her situation. Soldiers moved around a lot. And they shag a lot, too. Kevin! He's not wrong. More and more people that were fathered by servicemen now want to know who their fathers are. Who their father is. Surely they can each have only one. So let me get this straight, Mr Hoogstra. Please call me Alex. You get what information you can from us and then you just ship it off to Canada to find the father, right? I will take the information myself. The United States is my home, I travel from there. And when you find him, if you find him, you simply just walk on up, knock on his door, announce he has a son to meet, chop, chop, and hope he doesn't die of a heart attack? Well, I'd be a little more gentle than that. Daphne. If I locate your father and he's still living, I alone shall make the initial contact and if I find that he's amenable to the idea of meeting with you, at that point, and that point only, I shall release his personal information. It's a system that requires patience, but it provides absolute confidentiality to you and the person you're seeking. You mean, even if you find him, you won't tell me who he is. And vice versa, unless both parties agree to meet. How long will it take? Between two to six months. We'll need some time to discuss it. Of course. Thank you for coming. I look forward to hearing from you. Was your mother glad she'd chosen to meet her father? They never met. He refused to see her. I was ecstatic when the agency told me they had found my father, but a week later they told me he wouldn't even see me. He wouldn't even admit I existed. Jane's story is sadly typical. Less than 10% of fathers contacted agreed to meet with their children. If the expense worries you... At our age, it's this or Monte Carlo. I just don't understand why you suddenly need a father. I thought you were happy. I am. Then why is it not enough? Why are we suddenly inadequate? Sweetheart, it's not that. It's just knowing that he didn't die, that he's really there, would be like filling in a space that's been empty my whole life. Would be like knowing a part of my mother. Is this for her or for you? Both? Okay. You do what you have to, I suppose. Are you sure? You don't need my permission, Donald. How you doing? Are you feeling grouchy? No. A little grouchy. What's that? What does it look like? A plane. Yeah, it's an old plane. Helen? Mr Devereux. Yes? My name is Alex Hoogstra. I'm a researcher with Connection and Closure. Connection what? Closure. May I come in? Researching what exactly? We try to make connections between people like yourself, who had a significant role in World War II and- Oh, yeah, I don't want to talk about that. The book is closed. I'm working on behalf of someone that would like to reopen it. Yeah, well I'm not interested. But if someone were to want to- I said no. Well, would you mind confirming for me that you flew for the 532 squadron and that in November, 1944, you were on loan to the Royal Air Force for a special operation? Stop. This person, the one who sent you, who is it? I'm not permitted to say. Was it John Webster, my navigator? How's he? Is he still alive? I really can't say. Eddie Solomon. I need to respect their privacy. Their privacy. How did you even know all this? Your military records are now public domain. Public domain? Accessible to anyone. Yeah, well, I'm not. This interview is over. Did you spend time in Nottingham during 1945? Late 1944, first quarter of 1945, you were on location primarily in London. But, you spent time in Nottingham, correct? Then, perhaps you remember meeting their daughter. I, I, I don't recall. What was her name? Let me see here. Wanda Barlow. Wendy. Wendy. Huh, how silly of me. She, umm... Is Wendy the one who's looking for me? I'm sorry to say, she passed away several months ago. Mr Devereux, it was Wendy's son who wanted me to find you. Oh, okay. Why would he want to do that? Mr Devereux, he claims that you're his father. No. I assure you. No, it's impossible. He's got information that identifies you. No. He's a con artist or a liar. He's not my son. And Mr Devereux, he only wants to meet you while there's still time. I don't want to meet him. You understand? I don't want to see him. I don't want to hear from him, ever. - Mr Devereux... - Good day. Mr Devereux. Mr... Please. The blue jays are back. No blue jays for six years, then suddenly blue jays. Who was that at the door? Nobody. Does he have another family? I cannot say more than I have. I'm sorry. Did you get the sense that he might possibly change his mind? I did not. I'm truly sorry. Well then, that's that. I appreciate your visit. You're not alone. - You know, many other people- - I understand. Thank you. Let me show you out. Are you disappointed? I mainly just feel tired. Does Gordy know about the search for his great-grandfather? No. I think I've made our family confusing enough for him at the moment. Can I show you something? But you'll probably want to ask mum to make you a drink first. You know that I've been hired as a staff member at Source Magazine? Mm-hmm. Well, in about six months time we're going to start publishing a series called, "Where Are They Now" about people who made the news once and then faded into the background, the first heart transplant patient, triplets who were famous when they were five years old. My editor has been looking for proposals on more meaty topics and I think I've got a great one. You're not suggesting- No, not Nan's story, exactly. Let me start at the beginning. So in 1944, as the Allies advanced into Europe, there was a fear that they may execute some high level prisoners being held in the castle. Well, a prison really, near Bruge. The Allies set up a special two level task force. The air force would come in and breach a hole in the castle walls and disable the guards by bombing their quarters. And a commando unit would be parachuted in nearby to get the prisoners out. So, you're going to be interviewing the prisoners. I want to interview the pilots. It's recently come to my attention that many of them are still alive. No, Claire, it's out of the question. Gordon Devereux was the flight leader. He was first on the target. He led the other planes in. It's a great story. Hoogstra will never give you his address. He doesn't have to. The public records office has everything I need. That man has nothing to do with our family. I won't be there for our family. I'll be there for the story. That's all? That's all. And maybe I'm a little curious, fine, but it's a great story. And don't you want to know if your father was a war hero? You're not going to get my blessing on this. I'm not going to ask for it. Claire. Dad, he's not going to know who I am. I'm still using my married name for now, so he won't even make the connection. What came first? Hoogstra or the story. Hoogstra. But it's a great story. I just want to go in and get his version of events. My editor's excited. It's a spy story, and a war story, and a, Where Are They Now, story all rolled into one. It could be huge. And if the opportunity arose, you'd say to him, "Oh, did you know that I'm your granddaughter?" Yes, because I'm an idiot. Claire. No, of course not. I wouldn't ruin the biggest opportunity of my career just because I'm related to one of the subjects. The atmosphere would have to be extraordinarily conducive for me to even make a hint. Which you won't. Which I won't. When do you plan to start? As soon as Gordy's out of school for the summer. What? You're taking Gordy with you? We need to get away for a bit, especially while the house is being sold. Are you going to tell him? No, no. As far as he's concerned, it will be just another interview. You really think a war veteran is going to open up to you? I don't like it, Claire. Not at all. Well, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And bears. They have bears in Canada. No. umm, mm. Here are the books. Do you need anything else? No, that should be perfect. Thank you so much. Oh, Bunny, you can't bring that shirt with you. We need to make a good impression in Canada. But it's my favorite shirt. And don't call me Bunny anymore. But you are my bunny. You're my little Snuggle Bunny. You're my little Snuggle Bunny, aren't you? You're my little Snuggle Bunny. This is to announce the arrival of flight... Airlines Flight 700 from New York. Well, you never know when you were coming back, right? Each one was the last one. Thank you very much. Well, thank you. Enjoy your day. This is maple syrup, this is a Canadian delicacy. Gordy. Get out of that pond, right this second. No, Mum, we never do anything fun. I'm hot. Get out of the water. No. If you don't get out right this second, I'm getting in the car and leaving and you can grow up in Moose Jaw. Mum? Mummy? Mummy! I think this is it. Of course, Shea Stadium didn't open till 1964. It was a bad year for it, anyway, because Casey Stengel... now he was a bum as a player, a real clown, but a good manager, you know. A good manager at heart, or he was when he managed the Yankees. When the Mets hired him, disaster. They didn't have a good year in 64, oh no. That's very interesting, Mr Fournier. Pete, please. Pete. But what I'm really here to talk about is the raid. The raid? In Bruge, Mr Fournier, 1945? Yeah. Yes. Terrible time. We lost one, you know? So I've come to understand. I'm very sorry. Oh, don't be sorry. I got over it. It took me a lot of drinks, a little baseball, but I got over it. Not everybody does. I understand, it must have been horrible. You understand? What is this? Some kind of damned therapy? I assure you I'm only a journalist. I just know that post traumatic- You know what they used to call therapy in my day? Jack Daniels. I'm just trying to corroborate some details. You don't know. None of you knows. All these anniversaries come up, Deippe, Normandy, people like you come in here and say you want to know what it was like. You don't want to know what it was like. Not really. Saw a friend in a field hospital once, Jim Guido, 19 years old, already a hockey legend back home. He lost his leg somewhere in France, got infected, filled him full of morphine. Used to use that stuff back then. It gives you nightmares. It gives you nightmares like you wouldn't believe. I looked down at Jim lying there, 19 years old, never going to play hockey again, so full of morphine that he just moaning in his sleep. Just moaning, crying, and shaking like a baby. 19 years old, his leg blown clean off, crying for his mommy. And I wanted to pick up a bed pan and smash his face to pieces. I wanted to pick up something heavy and smash his face, and smash, and smash, so he wouldn't make any more noise, because I couldn't listen to it. I couldn't listen to anymore crying. We all felt it. We all had nightmares, but he had no right to cry like that. You keep that inside you. He had no right. He had no right. I think perhaps I should come back another time. There were things we did to people, young men, younger than us. Of course, when Casey Stengel was managing the Yankees back in the fifties, that was a good time. 10 pennants in 12 seasons. That was the good times. Wish I could go back there now. That was the good times. I wish I could go back to then. Good times. I'm really sorry to hear all that, Bunny. Maybe it wasn't a good idea for me to bring you along. I just mean that I wanted to take you on an adventure and now you've gotten to see all the boring parts of mum's job. Lots of travel, and waiting, and getting yelled at. This is the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Have you ever heard of Enola Gay? Yeah. I have. Pretty sad stuff. You know, you're really grown up in a lot of ways. One more interview to go. We just have to head West one more time and then we'll go see some mountains. Okay? We're taking flight, Captain. We have to get out of here, Captain. - Captain? - Standby. Mr Devereux? Yes. Claire Summers, how do you do? Not interested. In what? In whatever it is you're selling. Did you not get my letter? Mrs Summers, come in, come in. Gordon, this is Mrs Summers, the reporter I told you about. You didn't tell me about any reporter. Oh, I'm sure I did. I must have. Come in, come in. Your English. What gave me away? Would you like a coffee or tea? That's what you people like, isn't it? I'll just make some tea. Why are you here? Gordon, she's doing a newspaper project. She wrote to us all about it. Claire Summers, staff writer, Callishawe Press, sluff berks. Slough Berks. Gordon, I didn't know you knew so much about England. I was about to make some ice tea. What do you think? Oh, that would lovely. Thank you. Gordon? Thank you, Helen. So a project. I'm sorry that you weren't expecting me. I didn't mean to spring myself upon you. I'm a staff writer for Source Magazine. It's a middle road publication rather like your Maclean's, I think. We report on historical events, semi recent histories. Right now, I'm working on a series about people who were involved in a major historical event that has since faded from public memory. So you really are a reporter, huh? What else would I be? And you just happened to pick me? Not at all. I found a record of the RAF's raid on a Nazi prison in a castle near Bruge, November, 1944. I see. Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't give interviews about what I did during the war years. Matter of principle. I haven't revisited the war years since I was decommissioned in 1945, not even with my wife or our daughter. You've a daughter? No, when I took off my uniform for the last time I shut the door on all that, on all of it. Did you keep your uniform? Young lady, that is a very personal question. I've already told you I do not do interviews. Sorry. I didn't mean to offend. It's just that Patrice LaPage kept his, so I was curious. You spoke to Patrice? Flight Lieutenant Patrice LaPage, I should have said. And yes I did, and Ancienne Lorette in Quebec. My navigator trained there. John Webster. I met with him as well. I really am a journalist. Hmmm. I haven't just snuck in to steal your valuables and I think that this story deserves to be told. You don't need me for that. You was a pilot in charge. You led the raid. You were the first to fly- How on earth do you know this? Flight Lieutenant Wagner. Charlie? Charlie Wagner. He's a doctor now. Oh, Slap Dash Charlie, a doctor. Well, semi retired. He lives in Devon. I spoke with him before I left England, and I can give you his address if you'd like. No. No, I don't want anything. That part of my life is closed, besides he wouldn't want to meet me. No, put all of that behind me. It was difficult, but I had help, my wife, Helen and our daughter. That's behind me, now. Mr Devereux, it's not my intention to delve into painful memories. I just wanted to write a story that shows our readers what happened next, that there is life after... We will be besieged by people wanting to know more, banging on our door, expecting me to tell them everything, all the juicy details. You'll destroy our privacy. No, we can protect your identity and conceal your location. That would be entirely your choice. And you must remember the Source is only sold in the UK, so no one would even see it here. Iced tea. So... will you be staying long in Edmonton? Only about five days. We want to head to the mountains after. We? Is your husband with you? My son. Your son? How old is he? Nine. And where is he now? Helen, that's none of our business. He's waiting for me in the car. In the car? Oh, it's all right. He's got his books and his Gameboy. Well, we should bring him in. Oh, I wasn't sure if that would be a good idea. I thought, that is, Mr Devereux and I have potentially sensitive subjects to discuss. Oh, it's quite all right. We'll go to the other side of the house and leave you two in peace, but he shouldn't be left in the car. It's not right. Well, if your sure it's okay. Yes, all right, I'll be right back. You bored out here, Bunny? Do you want to come in for some iced tea? I wish you wouldn't. We should make them feel at home. Well, I should anyway. And you should have a chat with Mrs Summers. She seems very sympathetic. Gordie, these people are very nice. And I want you to be careful to be on your best behavior, all right? Don't talk about our family, okay? Mommy's a reporter and reporters don't share personal details. Understand? You will mind your manners, won't you, Gordon? Hello. Please come in. What's your name? Gordie. Gordie Summers. Gordie. We love that name in this house. Gordie, this is Mr and Mrs Devereaux. It's a pleasure to meet you, Gordie. Looking for something, Gordie? You don't have a picture of a mosquito? Gordie. We don't get too many mosquitoes at this time of the year. I think Gordie was referring to something else, weren't you, young man? De Havilland Mosquito made of plywood. Mom said that you- That's enough, Gordie. And where'd you learn about that? I have a book. What you been telling him? He learned that on his own. Now it seems we all have cool drinks, but I haven't offered you one. Why don't you come with me and we'll see what we can find? Would you like a soda? Go on. It's all right. Come with me. Where did he learn all that? I assure you- - Did you coach him? - Why would I- It's shameless. I'm not going to spill my guts out just because you trained your kid to come in here- Mr. Devereaux, I would never train Gordie to do anything. I know that you don't like to talk about your flying days and I'll tell him not to bring it up again. Then how does he know so much? He saw my research on the story and got interested. And when Gordie's interested in a subject, he's like a sponge. He just hones in and learns everything he can. Just like that? Just like that. I assure you, I would never use my son to manipulate anyone. He does this all the time. I must say his train phase was the worst. Well, my daughter went through a similar thing with dolphins. Still not going to be interviewed. - Thank you. - Don't thank me. You're not going to get anything from me. I was just going to say thank you for having Gordie in. I'm sure he's much more comfortable in the kitchen with Helen. Well, that's Helen for you. Whoa, it's huge. It's four layers. What's that? I made it for my grandson. It's very cool. Now, tell me everything. So your son, he's also named Gordon? No, he's just Gordie. Is he named after anyone in particular? Yes. Who? Gordie Howe. The Canadian hockey player? I know. - But you're- - I know. You're so English, I know. His father insisted. I couldn't find the strength to argue because I was so, so- - So what? - Pregnant. I succumbed. What's his middle name? Howe. Don't laugh, I was so pregnant. So how's the cake? It's very good. How's school? It's nice. Does your husband actually play? I don't even think he knows how to skate. Malcolm's always going through phases. First it was hockey, then it was safari travel, then me, in the end. How's young Gordie Howe taking it? He's fine. He's... Sorry. Sorry, this isn't why I'm here. He'll be all right. I'm not sure. I mean, sometimes I think if a father can't be 100% there, if he can't be a good... Maybe it's better for the child. Anyway... what did you want to ask me? What was it like to go overseas as a young man? Well, I'd never been east of Saskatoon, so I was excited. They told me that the girls danced naked in France. I bet your mother loved that. She sent a Bible with me. Go ahead. They've been in there for half an hour. If he was going to turn into a bear, he would have done it by now. His eyes weren't good enough for flight school. Did my wife send that? This is the Mark XVI. Though I flew the Mark IV before that. Was there 20 millimeter cannons? - Yeah, just about knee... - Knee level. Sometimes. It depended on the type of flying that we were doing. Gordie, I'm not sure that Mr Devereaux wants to talk about... Oh, no, no, no, it's all right. Tell you the truth, Gordie, none of my own kids have any interest in planes. It's nice to meet a fellow aviator. Do you like horses, Gordie? Yes. Gordie, you've never touched a horse. Supper's in the oven. Claire, Gordie, you'll stay and eat? Hello? Mum. Claire! What's wrong? Is that Claire? No, nothing. I'm so sorry, mum. Shit. What time is it there? It's gone 1:00. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot about the time change. No, no, we were up anyway. Claire, is everything all right? Is Gordie okay? Gordie's fine. He's... He's what? He's gone horseback riding. Did she say he's gone horseback riding? Claire, did you say he's gone horseback riding? Yes, just for a few hours. Claire, you took your son to a foreign country and now you're not with him? He's fine, mum. Well, this is actually why I called. He's, uhmm... He's with his great grandfather. What? Does he know? No, not at all. - How could you possibly- - Mum, listen. This is why I called. I called to say that everything's fine. The interview went well. He let you interview him? He and Gordie have become friends. Friends? Claire, I don't mean to sound like I'm interfering, but is Gordie safe on his own with this man? They're not alone, they're at a ranch. You let a strange man take your son to a ranch and ride a strange animal? He could break his neck. They're not doing show jumping, mum. Is he at least wearing a helmet? Mum, Mr Devereaux, Gordon, knows what he's doing. And Gordie was enthused. When was the last time you saw that? And you say, he's cooperating with you? Not at first, no. But because of Gordie. Gordie? He was the first talking point. The two of them just clicked. Why didn't you go with them? I don't know, it's just everything that's been going on with Malcolm, Gordie's just so stuck in his shell. I just don't think he needs his mum hovering right now. Anyway, I've got to go. They're having us over for supper. Claire? Yes? Be careful. I will. I love you. Love you too, sweetheart. Love you, sweetie. I hope she knows what she's doing. I do. I do too. I hope she knows what she's doing. Horse. Want to try riding it? Sure. All right. Then that is what we will do. Hello Jordan. This is my little friend, Gordie. Jordan: Hey, Gordie. Nice to meet you. Hello. Can we rustle up a horse for him? We sure can. Gordon: Hi boys, how you doing? Good. Good to see you. They're big. Gordon: Yeah, they're very big. Here we go. Do a circle, here. Isn't she nice? Yeah. Come on, babe. Just a little bit more. That's a good girl. Yes, you are. I think we may be getting a bit of clouds coming in. That's it. Well, Gordie, what do you think? Keep going? Ready for takeoff? Yes, sir. What are they doing? Flying. Now, when you want to climb, you pull back on the control column. Like this? Whoa, gently. You'll flip us right over. When you want to descend, you push forward. When you want to turn to the right, you press down the right pedal and turn the wheel to the right. That's right. We've got to do both at the same time to get a smooth angle to bank. Good. And left pedal for port? You got it, skipper. Now start the engines. Do you see the throttles down by your left knee? Push them forward? Yes, but smoothly. Okay. Now release the brake. Look straight ahead. All right. We've got an air speed of 190 knots. Pull back on the stick. And we're airborne. Now, turn starboard, skipper. Force 177 degrees, climb to 5000. 177? Ease back on the throttles and level out. Leveling out. Good job, captain. Aren't you the captain? I'm just enjoying the ride. Any fighters in the sky? Taking flight, captain. Shot down, captain. Any fighters in the sky? Big Gee, any fighters in the sky? Gordon, any fighters in the sky? For today, Little Gee, why don't we just fly? I met Gordon after the war. Men were in short supply around here, but that's not what caught my eye. What was it about him? He was so quiet. Not constantly bragging or talking about himself the way the boys I knew growing up. Plus, you wouldn't think it to look at him, but he was a stone cold fox. I know he went through a lot in the war, but he never wanted to talk about it. Men never did in those days. Sometimes I think it's healthier now with all the therapies and yoga and talking about your feelings. Yoga can't help with PTSD. Do you think that's what he had? I don't know. All I know is that as happy as we've been, I've never seen him let go the way he just did with your little boy. And now he's Big Gee. Mr Devereaux was too clumsy, and Uncle Gordon was too formal. Does that make you H for Helen? No, I'm Mrs Gee. Oh, I hope that doesn't bother you. We don't mean to lay any sort of claim on Gordie. It doesn't bother me at all. I'm so glad. After all, you can never have too much family. Claire, unless this is an emergency- I think dad needs to come here. What? Does he know? Claire, did you tell him? No, but just now he and Gordie, they were flying together and- They went flying? No, not actually. It's just that, well, they've become friends. Even Helen, Mrs Devereaux, says so too. I, I don't know, Claire. I wouldn't want to burst their bubble. But there's a chance that... To protect Gordie, not Devereaux. If Gordie's opened up to someone, I wouldn't want to risk that. Gordie will be fine. A tiny little window has opened up here and you won't get another chance. I'm not sure if the reward outweighs the risk. Stop talking like a banker, dad. I'm not asking you for a loan. Claire, dinner's ready. We're eating chow mein. That's right. I helped cook it. That's great, love. I'll be there in a moment. Look, in three days, Gordie and I are saying goodbye and leaving this place forever. They'll probably invite us to come back, but we probably never will. If you want Gordie to keep having a relationship with his family, you need to take a risk. I'm not sure. Just think about it. There's a flight leaving from Heathrow tomorrow, or today your time. You'd be here within 24 hours. Claire. Just think about it. I love you. Obviously, I can't go. What's she thinking of? You were right about this whole thing. You said I should stay away from Devereaux. I should've listened to you. Now Claire's gotten all mixed up in it. What are you doing? I'm booking you a ticket to Canada, you daft... You said it was mad. You thought this whole thing was mad. I'm allowed to change my mind. Good Lordy. It's just full of airports. This bloody country is full of airports. Airports and bears. Edmonton. Look for Edmonton. That's terrible. I know, it's a good one. Look what Gordie helped me make. It looks so delicious, doesn't it? Do you want the big pie? No, but what we're going to do is go back and paint. Thank you so much for taking Gordie to the ranch, Mr Devereaux. He was over the moon. Please, call me Gordon. Gordon. It was my pleasure. And thank you for a wonderful dinner, Mrs Gee. Would you and Little Gee be interested in going to West Edmonton Mall with us tomorrow? It's terribly touristy, I know, but you can't come all this way and not see it. It's one of the biggest in the world. I'm sure Gordie would love that. We also have a family friend flying in tomorrow afternoon and we'd love for you to meet him. Wonderful. Well, why don't we take Gordie to the mall while you go get your friend, and then we'll all have dinner together? Are you sure you think it's a good idea? It's a great idea. Any friend of Little Gee's a friend of ours. All right, let's go. Come on. How you doing, Bunny? Don't eat any of that Canadian bacon, though. Okay? Love you, sweetheart. Love you too. Say hi to Claire and Gordie. I will. You got everything, dad? The mini. You had to bring the mini. Oh, you don't like the mini? Psychological, isn't it? Got room for that? Oh, you'd be surprised what I got room for. Oh, yeah. That too, yeah? Are You ready for this? Honestly, Kevin, I don't know. Could have taken the Land Rover. Could've had you on the back of a Triumph too. I flew with the Canadian Air Force most of the time, but late in 1944, I was seconded to an RAF squadron. Seconded? Sent on loan for about three months. That's when you flew on the Bruges raid? Little Gee, do you have a swimsuit with you? How'd you know about the Bruge raid? That's what mom's writing about. Sort of, Bunny, not so much about the operation, but about the pilots and navigators who flew it and what they're up to now. Like horseback riding? Mm-hmm and building model planes, and giving medals to young pilots. What's that for? This is the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. It's from when I was a pathfinder. What's a pathfinder? A pathfinder flies over the target, ahead of the bombers. I dropped flares over the target, very bright lights, so the bombers could aim at them. Were you scared? Yes. Often. Were you sad that you had to help drop bombs? I think this look is about complete. Would you like to have a look at yourself, Little Gee? Yeah, Big Gee. Well, what do you think? I wish Grandpa Barlow could see me like this. Who? Granddad Barlow. Can we take a picture for him? Is Granddad Barlow your mom's dad? Yeah. You wouldn't happen to know his first name, would you? I don't know. I see. This Grandpa Barlow, did you ever meet his mother? It'd be your great-grandmother. Yeah, but she died. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What was her name? I don't know. I called her Nan. She lived in Nottingham. Oh no, Mom said not to tell you. She said it's not good journalism. Everybody ready to go? Little Gee, Why don't you get out of that uniform and go put your your shoes on? Go on. What's wrong? What happened? Gordon? Ready to go? I'm almost finished with your logbook. What's wrong? You take Gordie to the mall. I need to talk some more with Mrs Summers. Gordon, what's- Or should I say Ms. Barlow? Gordie, Why don't you to the mall just with Mrs Gee? I need to talk a little bit more with Mr Devereaux. That's right, Gordie. Go grab your jacket. Okay? Are you sure it's okay to leave? Of course. Have fun. I didn't mean for you... Sit down. You're his daughter. Donald Barlow. A man who claimed, he claimed that- I never intended- What? To humiliate me? To spy on me? No, I just intended to conduct the interview and leave. Oh, you don't expect me to believe that. You set this whole thing up. The project. The research. What for? Money? You wanted an inheritance? Is that it? The project is real. The magazine I showed you is real. I'm researching... Stop! Stop. You even dragged the boy in here to soften me up, to worm your way... I told you I would never use Gordie to get a story. You primed your son to trap me! I promise you, Gordie is innocent in all of this. Oh, Gordie. Gordon! You must think I'm an idiot. You named the kid after me. All along, you planned this. That's not true. I told you my husband named him Gordie. He's named after Gordie Howe. You don't expect me to believe that story? Not after all the lying that you've done? Gordie Howe Summers. If I was going to make something up, I would've made it less stupid. I have never lied to you, Mr Devereaux. I only concealed my relation to you because I know that you want nothing to do with my family. But everything else that's happened over the past few days has been an honest result of seeing my son happy and wanting to keep him that way. You are my granddaughter? I am. But that means that this boy, Gordie, he is my... He's your great-grandson. And you'll exclude him from any recriminations? Of course. Then I'll say goodbye. Thank you for everything you've done for Gordie, but this has been a mistake. I'll be back in a few hours to pick up Gordie. I don't want to ruin his time here, so when I come back, we'll be civil. Agreed? Thank you for everything you've done for my son, and I'm sorry to have caused you pain. Claire, a family friend that you're going to pick up from the airport? My father. Your son. But I won't bring him here, not unless you tell me that's what you want. You have my phone number. The rollercoaster goes zooming, goes so high... And then it falls down. It was so, so... Big Gee, we went to the slides and the amusement park and there was a skating rink and Mrs Gee bought me a hat! Why don't you take everything inside, Gordie? Has she gone? Yes. She'll come get Gordie when we call? Yes. You know that she's your granddaughter? You knew? Of course I knew. How? I looked this place up, Connection Closure. They only do one thing. Plus I bribed Gordie. With what? Cake. Like great-grandfather, like great-grandson. Stop. This is private. From your wife? Oh, it was before your time. You can tell me. I don't want to talk about it. I didn't know about a child. And I didn't want to tell you that I had been with someone before you. Oh, Gordon, this isn't 1945. Did you love her? You have to talk to somebody sometime, Gordon. I was so terrified. Night after night. Searchlights probing. Flack sliding towards us. Guns on the ground. Never knowing if you would be... When the weather clear, there'd be a stand down and everyone I knew would go to London. But there were so many bombed-out homes. One morning... She was still holding a doll. Then I'd get in the plane and I'd go help do that same thing to little girls in Germany. Got to make way for the bombers, Captain. Roger that. Prep munitions. Roger, Captain. The next stand down, I got on a bus. I'd get out of the city and run up to Nottingham, that's where I met Wendy. And Wendy didn't ask questions. There were no bombs falling. I could just forget. I didn't mean to abandon her. I don't think of it like that. And I swear, I didn't know about the child. When the war ended, I promised myself I'd just start over. I'd just erase the nightmare, pretend it never happened. I didn't realize I'd be erasing other things too. Oh, Gordon... have you told Claire any of this? No one. Ever. I think you should. I think she'd understand you better. Might be too late. Where are you going? I'll be right back. It's a mess. I've made a horrible mess. He found me out. Oh, Claire. I'm so sorry. It's all right. It's not. You came all this way. I took a risk. It's all right. And now I'm in Canada. Should we do some sightseeing before we head home? Yes, absolutely. We just need to pick up Gordie on the way home. Are you sure you should have left him there? I know. I know, but none of us wanted to ruin his day. You can stay in the car so you and Mr Devereaux don't have to meet. So close and yet so far. I'm so sorry, Dad. Don't be sorry. It was my decision. And now, I get to see my daughter. It's not that I dislike the idea of having a great-grandson, though that does make me sound a little... Distinguished? Old, I was going to say. But I suppose if one could choose a great-grandson... Of course, there's a corollary. You can't have a great-grandson without having a son first. What you going for? This is your Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. Canada. Bloody hell. Dad. Hello? Granddad. Hi, Granddad. Hello again. Gordie, how many sweets did you eat? All of them? Well, why don't you do your granddad a favor and go help Mrs Devereaux make some tea? I'm sure he'd love some. All right. Hello. Would you like to come in? Please.
