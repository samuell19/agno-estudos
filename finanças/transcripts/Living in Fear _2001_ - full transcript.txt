(bombastic music) (light piano music) [Woman] Don't touch me. Let go of me! No! (woman moaning) (screams) (light piano music) (man grunting) (door slams) (engine revs) (light piano music) Yes, Jason, central California is beautiful. Now give me the real news. [Jason] I've been trying with that guy. I haven't had any luck yet. Well, what's the problem? Look, I'm gonna level with you, Chuck and I are in a bind. We're depending on you to secure the next round of financing. The whole business is riding on this. I'm counting on you, Jason, just make it happen. [Jason] I'm gonna do everything I can. Okay. Bye, bye. Can he do it? I dunno. This wasn't a good time to take off. I didn't let you talk me into coming to the funeral. I shouldn't have let you talk me into coming now. You know, it's been a long time. Things change. These people never change. That's why I didn't want to drag you out here. (dramatic music) I think his church is just up the road here. The cemetery's behind it. Well, we should stop and pay our respects. Why? 'Cause this is where the healing starts, Chuck. (dramatic music) (crow caws) You will not do this. I forbid it! Don't turn your back on me when I'm speaking to you. You wanna hit me? Go ahead. Remembering only the bad isn't going to help you, Chuck. He was a preacher, a man of God, there must be some good things you can say about him. He was smart, I'll give him that. Book smart, people smart. Folks around here, they look up to him. Wouldn't make a move unless he sanctioned it. He loved having that kind of power over people. I didn't know she was buried here. Was only 19. I was 20. We were only married eight months. Longer than us. (dramatic music) Poor child. Lost control of her car, drove right over a cliff. 20 years. But I still remember that night like it was yesterday. First fatality I ever saw. Sorry about your dad, Chuck. Nobody even knew he was dying until one day he was almost comatose. At least he went quick after that. This lovely lady your wife? Rebecca. Lyle Pointer. You ever meet Leo? No. There was nobody quite like him. So I'm learning. Didn't mean to bother you but how long you in town for? Only as long as it takes. That's good. No sense hanging around stirring things up. Well, I'll be on my way. Have a nice day. (suspenseful music) Hausman. Come to pick over your father's bones, huh? Missed the funeral. Guess the reading of the will is another story. Nice to see you too, Gromek. People 'round here don't forget. They still know what you are. It's been 20 years. Give it a rest. Not until you're six feet under, like my boy. What was that all about? He hates me because his son came home from the Marines in body bag and I didn't. I don't understand. His son, Donnie, and me enlisted together. I got sent home on a medical discharge. Yeah, you tore your knee up, so? Well, look at what the wind blew in. Art Sannar, I'll be damned. You leave here in the dead of night, don't tell anyone, don't say goodbye, and after 20 years you can't even manage one damned phone call. (laughs) Good to see you. What are you still doing in Deerfield? I'm running the Bar and Grill. I took it over from my dad. I heard you're living in Los Angeles. Yeah, I have a small computer software company. And people said you'd never amount to anything. Looks like life's been good to you in every way though, Chuck. Oh, this is my wife, Rebecca. Hi, Art Sannar. Nice to meet you. Chuck always did end up with the prettiest girl. Am I right, Chuck? What are you guys doing here? Oh, Wilkerson told us to come by. He says there something in Leo's will about the money we gave him to invest. I didn't know he was still doing that. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, every year like clockwork. This year he got us to dig deep. But he died before he told us what happened to it. Chuck. Glad you could make it. Come on in, we're about ready to start. I have here the last will and testament of the Reverend Leo Hausman, summarized in a letter by him. Which I'll read to y'all now. Dear family and friends, my bequeaths as stated herein, reflect the modest means of a man who devoted his life to his church. So that there'll be no misunderstanding, it should be noted that this money is my personal savings and not in any way connected to any investment funds. To my son, Chuck, I leave the sum of $10,000, as well as all of my worldly possessions whose sentimental value far exceeds their monetary worth. To Katrina Ford I... Anybody seen Ms. Ford? Probably out scaring little kids. (laughs) To Katrina Ford, my loyal housekeeper and cook, I also leave the sum of $10,000. And to Art Sannar, because he has shown great appreciation for them, I leave my entire collection of old record albums. My final thoughts are addressed to my investors, Pete Gomek, Cliff Bartok, and Art Sannar, I will not hold you in suspense any longer, the money is gone. What does he mean gone? Cliff, wait until I finish, okay? Although I invested the money according to plan and with good intent, it was a miserable failure. We lost everything. I am truly embarrassed and humiliated. Nothing more I can say except, I'm sorry. May God bless you all, Reverend Leo Hausman. Your dad fucked us! I wouldn't know about that. I haven't spoken to Leo in 20 years. Look, I didn't know Leo, but it doesn't make any sense that he'd swindle you when he was dying. What's he gonna do with the money once he's dead? All I know is there was never a problem with any investment but not until we gave him $250,000. That's a shame it's taken you so long to find out Leo could let you down. Some of us learned that a long time ago. If you have a grievance you can sue the estate. Or you can call in the Feds. You know we can't do that, Jay. We can't have anybody poking around our finances. We'll handle this our own way. I'm really sorry about all this. Chuck, I have something here for you. Leo made me promise to give this to you in person. And in private. Why? That I couldn't tell ya. I just know it was very important that it be done this way. Tell me something, what do you think happened to the money? Did Leo pull a fast one? I dunno. I don't wanna know. I tell ya something, those boys are not just some little old ladies from Iowa looking to play the stock market. Their tax cheaters looking to make a quick killing. And if Leo ever needed some help with those investments he sure as hell didn't call me. Word of caution, I'd watch myself with those others. You know, some dogs mellow with age, and others just keep getting meaner. (door slams) [Jeanine] Chuck. Who's that? Someone I knew in high school. [Rebecca] Looks like she really wants to see you. I'll just say hi, I'll be right back. Hey! I been thinking about what you said in there. About why would Leo con us out of our money when he knows he's gonna die. Maybe you're right, maybe he did lose the money like he said. Then again, maybe Leo wanted to leave Chuck a lot more than $10,000. You don't leave a pot of gold to a son you've been estranged from for 20 years. He's Leo's blood. His only son. I woulda done the same for mine. Chuck told you he doesn't know about the money. What's it gonna take for you to believe him? I'd never believe him, why should I? He's sick in the head. That's why they tossed him outta the Marines. What? They locked him up in a mental hospital. Hey, hey, Gromek. Leave her the hell alone. Man never knows when to let up. So I've noticed. Jeanine Riker, did you meet her? No. A real piece of work. Chuck's first girlfriend. Nothing serious though. Just a high school crush. Didn't last too long. Probably because he was already making eyes at my girl. (laughs) Anyway, I gotta get going. Mind if I stop by later and pick up those records? Sure, whenever you like. Great. See you then. [Rebecca] See you. Come on, let's get out of here. Saw you talking to Gromek. What'd he want? He has this idea that Leo stole the money to give to you. What? I'm just telling you what he said. Said something else too. I mean, he told me that you were discharged from the Marines because you were in a mental hospital. Chuck? It's true. What do you mean it's true? Leo wanted me to go to college so of course I signed up for the Marines. I knew right away I'd made a mistake. After 18 years of living under the same roof with Leo I couldn't stand being ordered around by anybody. Unfortunately my options were limited. I chose insanity. What does that mean? It means I faked it, the whole thing. I started acting crazy, hyper one day, paranoid the next. Landed me in a psychiatric hospital for a couple of months. But it did get me outta the Marines. And that was all I cared about at the time. You should've told me, Chuck. You're absolutely right. The truth is, I wasn't sure you'd marry me if you found out. I love you too much to risk that. (door slams) Very nice. The church owns all of it? Most of the furnishings too. My god, it's my old Mustang. I thought Leo would've sold it the first weekend I didn't come back. Maybe he was saving it for you, hoping you would. I'm gonna go take a look. (suspenseful orchestral music) [Leo] You disobey me. You're full of the devil and I'll not have it. Come back here! Leave me alone. (young Chuck crying) Chuck, are you coming? (door creaks) (suspenseful orchestral music) I'm gonna go look around. (suspenseful orchestral music) Pray with me. Pray for forgiveness. Chuck, don't go. (door slams) Rebecca! I'm in the kitchen. Hey, Chuck, who cooked for you when you were growing up? Chuck? Chuck? Chuck? [Woman] Don't blame this on me. This is your fault and I don't care what happens to you. I hope you die! I hate you! Honey? What's wrong? Oh just... Got lost in my thoughts for a minute. It's been a hard day. Maybe you should go sit down. No, I'm alright. Just a little thirsty. Think I'll go in the kitchen and get a glass of water. Okay, I'm gonna go check out upstairs. (door slams) (suspenseful orchestral music) (laughs) There's no food in the house. I'll drive into town and get a few things from the store so we can have something nice for dinner tonight. No, you rest, I'll go. You don't even know where the store is. Besides, I was gonna take my old car out for a spin. Kill two birds with one stone. You stay here and have a look around. See if there's anything you wanna take home to L.A. with us. Well, there's a few things that I'm interested in. Anything you want. (suspenseful orchestral music) Be back before you miss me. (engine revs) (suspenseful orchestral music) Alright, Jeanine, you got me here. Now, what's this all about? Let's just try to be nice to each other okay, Chuck? Like it used to be. I don't have time for games. Are you happy with your life, Chuck? Jeanine, please. I hate mine. I should've left Deerfield when you did. There's nothing for me here. My husband, Stuart, he's a... He's an abusive son of a... I'd leave him if I could just scrape enough money together, you know? But tips at Art's bar just don't amount to much. That's about it for jobs around here for me. Spit it out. What do you want? Like I said, I need some money. I don't need much, I'm not greedy. The 10,000 that Leo left you, that would be plenty. Why the hell would I give you 10,000? Because you owe me dammit! I let you start a new life now it's time you do the same for me. What are you talking about? I was there the night Mary died. She called me. Told me you two had a big fight. She was high as a kite. Asked me to come over with a couple of ludes to help her come down. So I drove over thinking she'd be alone. That's when I saw you... Coming out of the house carrying her body. I never told anyone 'cause I didn't wanna see you go to prison. I was... I was still in love with you, Chuck. Then don't do this to me, Jeanine. I'm doing what I have to. I gotta get outta this town, Chuck. You can do it without blackmailing me. This isn't blackmail. This is just you saying thanks for 20 years of my silence. And if I don't pay? You got 10,000 you didn't have yesterday, maybe a lot more if you can find the money Leo took from his friends. There is no other money. And I couldn't explain it to my wife, giving you $10,000. Could you explain to her how Mary died? (dramatic music) (phone beeping) [Operator] Directory assistance. Could I have the number for the Deerfield sheriff's office? (truck idling) Let's get outta here. Come on, let's go. (screams) (knife slashing) (Jeanine grunting) No, they didn't come onto the property. They just sat in the truck and they drove off. [Sheriff] What would you like me to do, Mrs. Hausman? Well, I thought if you could talk to them, maybe you'd put them on notice. [Sheriff] Sure, I'll be happy to speak to them. Yeah, I'd feel a lot safer if you did. [Sheriff] Okay. Thank you, Sheriff, I appreciate that. [Sheriff] Don't worry, ma'am. Bye, bye. [Sheriff] Bye. (frantic knocking) (gasps) I'm Mrs. Ford. Did I frighten you? (engine rumbles) (door slams) Honey, why were you gone so long? I'm sorry, I took a drive to clear my head. I was worried. Why didn't you call me on the cell? I tried, the battery's dead. Well. Oh, honey. I was worried. We have a visitor. Mrs. Ford. Chuck. We thought we'd see you at the reading of the will. I knew everything I needed to know. Reverend Hausman told me. I was with him, even at the end. Through all that pain. But he was very strong. I didn't see a car out front. You still walking around everywhere at all hours of the night? You only need a car if you have places to go, or people to see. Well, I'm sure that Chuck would be happy to give you a ride home. No, I'll walk. It's only a mile. Well, is there anything we can do for you? I'm here to cook dinner, just like always. Oh, Mrs. Ford, that's awfully nice of you but you don't need to bother. I have made dinner in that kitchen every night for 30 years. It's what I do. Well, you go right ahead. We'd be very grateful. I guess I'll put these in the kitchen. Why did you buy groceries? I left plenty in the refrigerator. Well, the food looked spoiled so I threw it out. What a wasteful thing to do. (knife banging) (suspenseful orchestral music) (door creaks) (suspenseful orchestral music) [Leo Voiceover] When a father looks at his young son he wonders what kind of man he'll make when he's grown. Then when his son has finally become a man, all the father sees is the face of the boy he once loved. This photo means everything to me. Give it your careful attention son. This is how I always picture you, an innocent, young boy, full of life and promise. Just browsing or are you looking for something in particular? I thought there might be something in here about the money. Such as? Where it is. Sounds like you don't believe Leo any more than the others do. I wanna find the truth. Think it's in there? Leo's version of it anyway. I don't know if he stole that money but if he did, it's a pretty good bet that it's somewhere in this book. And he'll tell us where he hid it and why he did it. (rapid knocking) Hey there, Mrs. Ford. How are you? I just don't buy the story about a bad business investment. Leo was too smart. The money's around somewhere. The way I figure it, he knew he couldn't cheat death so he (laughs), he cheated us just to show he had us by the stones even when he was in the ground. I don't know what to tell you, Art. I haven't seen you or Leo for 20 years. I don't know what was going on between you two or the others. But in all that time I never got a penny out of him. He left me the money you heard about today and not a cent more. Just let's say you just happen to find the money, what would you do with it? (suspenseful music) Turn it over to the sheriff, let him handle it. It's just an awful lot of cash. It's tempting to... What? What are you trying to say? I'm saying that... I'd think you'd keep it. (dramatic music) Food's wonderful. Paid too much for it. The Reverend was content with simple dishes. I'll make sure you have clean sheets and towels upstairs. We're fine, I already checked. I'll see for myself. Another reason why I stayed away so long. She's tough but I bet it took someone like her to put up with Leo. (Chuck chuckles) What was that for? Telling Art that you wouldn't keep the money if you found it. I know how much we can use it right now. That's for sure. I don't want anything to do with that money. I was glad to hear that you don't either. (suspenseful music) (car engine rumbles) (dog barking) That Leo sure left you a bunch of crap, didn't he? No, Cliff, there's actually some classics here. Aint' worth the money you gave him. That old Reverend, he sure took us for a bunch of chumps, didn't he? Yeah, it sorta looks that way. What are we doing about it? Nothing. What can we do? We can look under every rock in this town 'til we find where he hid the money. Now, Pete, you'll just be inviting trouble. Better that then sitting around here crying in our beer. I want my money. Yeah, you took the words right outta my mouth. Where do we start? The house, that's where we gotta look first. What were Chuck and his wife doing when you went up there? Just going through Leo's things. Picking through stuff to take back to L.A. with them. They could find the money? Yeah, they could. They could find the money and be gone before we get there. We better make sure that doesn't happen. Let's get outta here. I was just thinking about something I saw in Leo's journal. What? It was a picture of me up in my treehouse when I was about 12 years old. A photo of you? (laughs) Do you realize I haven't seen a picture of you before the age of 21? There's not a single one in this entire house. Alright, well I'll get it for you. Don't make a mess up there. (dramatic music) Mrs. Ford. Did you move a journal from the desk up here? Hang on, Chuck, I'll ask her. (dramatic music) Mrs. Ford? Where are you going? (suspenseful music) Mrs. Ford! (suspenseful music) Where is she going? She's got the journal. Mrs. Ford, what are you doing with that book? I took care of him every day, morning 'til night, 'til they laid him in the ground. That money is mine! Hang on! Come back! Can't let her take the journal. Chuck, wait! (suspenseful music) Chuck! Where are you? (suspenseful music) Chuck! (suspenseful music) Chuck! Answer me! Chuck! Becca! (suspenseful orchestral music) Mrs. Ford. Oh god! Chuck, is she? There's no pulse. Oh my god, Chuck, what happened? I don't know. She fell and hit her head on the rocks. I found her like that. We better call the sheriff. No! We have to report this. I can't think! I can't think... Chuck. We can't call Lyle. We can't call anybody. There's been a death! We have to tell somebody. They'll think I killed her. Why would they think that? It was an accident. They won't see it that way. But it's the truth. They don't care about the truth. What are you talking about? Don't you understand? Don't you see what I'm up against with this narrow-minded town? Chuck, listen to me, people are going to think whatever they want no matter what you and I say or do. Okay? Now, we can't just leave her here because they're gonna find her body later and it's gonna be worse. Alright, sweetheart? Alright. Call the sheriff, go call the sheriff. I'll stay with her with the light so you can find your way back. (dramatic music) (phone beeping) (car rumbling) (door creaks) (dramatic music) Take the basement. (Rebecca gasps) (dramatic music) Where's your husband? None of you damned business. I'll tell you what is my damned business, our money. Now, I'm gonna search this house from top to bottom and if I don't find it, I'm going to go out to he garage, through the flowerbeds, and tear up every shrub and tree for a mile around. You have no right to do this. And Leo had no right to steal our money. (dramatic music) Don't do this! Stay outta there! Oh no! Get your hands off of me! You watch your hands, little lady. (knee thuds) (Cliff grunting) God! Get back here! (suspenseful orchestral music) What the hell happened? She's upstairs, get her! (gun fires) You put that damned thing down. Next one won't be a warning shot. Now, get out! Better do what she says. I warned you boys to stay away from here. What about our money? I don't care about your money. It's not my problem. But you keep harassing people like this you're gonna make it my problem. You wanna press charges? No. Well, it's your lucky day, boys. Now clear outta here before she changes her mind. (dramatic music) [Cliff] Just get in the truck for crying out loud will you? [Pete] You get in the truck. Did you see the way... [Cliff] I saw the way she looked. This isn't going to do any good for you... [Pete] I'm gonna go back there and they're gonna make off with all our money! Why don't you give me the gun? (car engine rumbles) What the hell happened here? Leo's charming friends paid us a visit. [Chuck] Thank god you're alright. You're wife might've bagged one of those dumbasses if I hadn't shown up when I did. Why are you here? I'm investigating a missing person. Who? You know damned well who. It's his wife, Jeanine. What? You're old girlfriend? She was supposed to go to a friend's birthday party tonight but she never showed up. You know anything about it? No. Reason I ask is, Art told me he saw her get into a car with you this afternoon. I didn't say I wasn't with her. I just said I don't know anything about her being missing. Did you know they were out driving around together? No. I didn't tell Rebecca about it because 'cause there's nothing to mention. I ran into Jeanine in town and she asked for a ride home, that's the extent of it. Anybody see you drop her off? I don't know, Lyle. You seem to think I know more than I'm telling you. Sheriff, why so many questions about a person that's only been missing for a few hours? There's a little bit more to it. Stuart here found her scarf on the ground behind the house, there was blood on it. Oh my god. Well, maybe Stuart knows more than he's telling. The hell with you. Jeanine said he was abusive to her. You bastard! You're a murderer and everybody knows it! Get the hell outta my house! [Lyle] Okay, outside. If you've hurt my wife, I'll kill you. Stu, you go home and you cool down before you do something you're gonna regret. If I were you I wouldn't be pointing fingers at anybody. Especially being the last person to see Jeanine. I'm sorry. Now, I'm going back to the office. I'll probably be in and out the rest of the night. If you think of anything you call me. And if I'm not there you leave a message. Sheriff, wait. There's something that we need to tell you about Mrs. Ford. Mrs. Ford took a few things from the house. I guess she felt entitled. It's upset Rebecca. But I'd just as soon not make a big deal out of it. Sounds like something you should work out between yourselves. You're absolutely right. I sure hope Jeanine's alright. Me too. (dramatic music) (door creaks) Why did you stop me from telling the sheriff about Mrs. Ford? I had to, they were grilling me about Jeanine, bringing up Mrs. Ford would've only added fuel to the fire. Well, we can't just leave her out there. As soon as they find Jeanine we'll tell them about her, alright? No, Chuck, it's not alright. There is nothing more that we can do for her. She deserves a proper burial. I know, and she'll have one, I promise you. But for my sake and for yours now is not the time to let anyone know she's dead. (suspenseful orchestral music) None of this would even be an issue if you hadn't given Jeanine a ride. I did an old friend a favor. It was completely innocent. I had know way of knowing it would turn out like this. Look, this all will be worked out very soon. Just hang in there with me. I love you, Rebecca. (suspenseful music) What is it? Why did Jeanine's husband say you were a murderer? (dramatic music) I tried to tell you about it back in the woods. This town is full of people that swear that I'm a... A lot of people swear that Mary's death wasn't an accident. Is it true? No. We were just a couple of mixed up kids living under the same roof with Leo. It was a bad situation that only got worse. By the end we were fighting constantly. Her drinking, her drugs, it all got out of control. But despite all that people liked her. She was fun, made friends easily. Me, they all hated. I was the angry, young man who wouldn't march in step. Not to mention a former mental patient. So when Mary died they were all quick to believe I killed her. It became the gospel around here. Truth be damned. So that's why you left and never came back. Yes. (suspenseful music) (knife banging) Mrs. Ford! (dramatic music) (gasps) (door creaks) Chuck! (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic music) (Rebecca gasps) (screams) (shovel thuds) Oh god. Every year on this day I say a special prayer, and yet every year I'm less sure about how it all happened. [Leo] Mary was weak and all those who constantly indulged her are as guilty as she. Her weakness was not Mary's sin, it was her undoing. Once she had committed such an unforgivable sin she should have confessed only to God, and not to Chuck. If only she had. If only she had her life would have been spared. (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic music) (engine revs) (dramatic music) Rebecca? Hi. I'm so sorry to disturb you. Could I talk to you for a minute? It's important. - Sure come on in. - Thank you. I don't know whether it's the town that sets the mood or the people themselves but whatever it is Deerfield is one angry town. Year in, year out, never seems to change. If you're not part of the crowd, it you play your own tune, you're just asking for trouble. Chuck found that out the hard way. Well people can be narrow-minded and mean and still be right about Chuck. (suspenseful music) Are they? You're asking me it Chuck killed Mary? Yes I am. Mary's car went over a cliff, her system was full of drugs and alcohol, medical examiner ruled it accidental death. Her parents wanted to reopen the case but the state attorney saw no cause to reinvestigate. So, I don't know what I can tell you. Tell me what you really believe. Well, given what was going on between Chuck and Mary at the time I think there's a bit more there than meets the eye. But Chuck a murderer? No, I don't see it. Course what I think doesn't matter. Only Chuck knows the whole truth. (suspenseful music) I wake up and you're gone. So was the journal in her car? I don't know whether to be angry or worried. I went to see Wilkerson. Why did you do that? I found myself wondering whether or not I could trust you. Then I read this. Go ahead. Read it. (suspenseful music) You didn't show this to Wilkerson? Depending on what he told me, I wasn't sure if I was coming back. And here I am, and whether I stay or go depends on what you tell me. I love you, Rebecca. Tell me the truth, Chuck. What happened to Mary? I want you to trust me. I need that. But I'm trying to protect you from all this. No more secrets. It's not about that. It's about getting you involved in a crime. What crime? Mary didn't die in a car accident. Don't touch me! But it wasn't me, I didn't have anything to do with it. I wasn't even there. It was Leo. Tell me how could you do this? They were upstairs arguing. It got violent, Mary tried to run from Leo, and he caught her on the landing. (Mary screaming) He pushed her or she pulled away, I don't know which. (Mary thudding) What were they arguing about? Mary slept with Leo. Oh god. She told me about it that night. She was cruel. They were both cruel in their own way. And to tell you the truth I don't know who seduced who. My wife sleeps with my father and then throws it in my face. Burned in my guts like a cancer. We had it out that night, it got vicious between us, but I swear to god I never laid a hand on her. I ran outta the house before... I jumped in my car and I drove away. I was so angry it was a miracle I didn't kill myself. When I was gone Leo came back. She told him everything. That I knew that they'd slept together. He snapped, he flew into a rage, all that guilt turned into anger. When I came home... (Leo sobbing) I found Mary at the foot of the stairs he was beside her. Begged for forgiveness. From me, from god, from my dead mother. Pleaded with me to help him. I'd never seen him like that before. He cried like a child. I knew then that I had to help him. In some strange way I felt sorry for him. So I did the unthinkable. I put Mary's body in her car. And I sent it over a cliff to make it look like an accident. I left town the day after the funeral. I don't know what to say. You can start by telling me you believe me. I can't. I just need a little time to let it all sink in. Do you even have an instinct about it one way or the other? No, not after everything that's happened today. And what about Jeanine, for God's sakes? Why do you care about Jeanine? I'm just trying to put it all together. I mean did you really have a chance meeting in town? No. She was trying to blackmail me. She saw me put Mary's body in the car, she kept quiet about it for 20 years, she's desperate for money. What did you tell her? That she wouldn't get even one dime outta me. Trust me it's all been taken care of. Trust you? Those are empty words to me right now. I don't know if you're the man I fell in love with or if you're... Or if I'm what? A murderer? In that case. What are you doing? Chuck, please no. You don't trust me? You had better keep this with you. I'm sorry. Keep it pointed at me because you never know. Don't do this, okay? (door creaks) (suspenseful music) I'm closing up, Stu. You okay to drive? Yeah, yeah. Go home. I got nobody to go home to. Yeah, I know, Stu, it's a raw deal. I'm sure she'll turn up. Yeah. In how many pieces? Look, I can't help thinking we wouldn't be having this conversation if I hadn't let her leave early. Let me ask you something. What excuse she give for cutting out on ya? Said she was meeting somebody. Chuck Hausman? [Art] She didn't say. But that's who it was, wasn't it? I guess. You saw her get in the car with him, right? Yeah, so? That lying piece of garbage. Said it was just a coincidence he met up with her. Said it right to my face! Well, if that's what he said then that's probably what happened. Don't get all worked up, Stuart. Now come on, don't do anything foolish. (swing squeaking) (suspenseful music) (book thuds) (suspenseful music) What was once your refuge from me, is not the repository of your reward. (dramatic music) (Chuck grunts) (swing squeaks) (suspenseful music) (dramatic orchestral music) (keys jingling) (dramatic music) (Rebecca gasping) (dramatic music) Are you alright? What's wrong? I found the money. Leo hid it in the treehouse. Really? (dramatic music) Wait! What's gotten into you? Get your hands off me! Not until you tell me what this is all about. - You killed Jeanine. - What? I found the body in the trunk of your old car. This is crazy, I didn't kill her. I don't know anything about it. I don't wanna hear any more of your lies! Get away from me! Rebecca. Rebecca, listen to me. I didn't kill anybody. You gotta believe me, Rebecca. Rebecca, I don't know what you're talking about. I swear. Wait a second, wait a second! I didn't! Please, don't do this. I didn't kill anybody. (sobbing) (tires screeching) [Stuart] Jeanine! You gotta die. (rifle blasts) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (men grunting) (rifle thuds) (dramatic music) (engine revs) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) Art! (knocks) Art! [Art] What are you doing? Chuck killed Jeanine. [Art] What? I found the body back at the house. Oh god. I went to the sheriff's office, he's not there. We have to get ahold of him. Alright, alright take it easy. I don't know where Chuck is. He could be coming after me right now. You're safe here, don't worry. Come on, come on. Just go into my office and stay there. I'll make sure the back door is locked. And I'll phone Lyle. (door slams) (Rebecca breathes heavily) (dramatic music) Like you said, Lyle wasn't in his office, and he wasn't at home either so I left messages both places. So what do we do now? Just wait 'til we hear from him. (tires screech) That could be Lyle. Just stay here. (Chuck knocking) [Chuck] Let me in, Art! Open the damned door. Art! Open it up, come on! Open the damned door, Art! Open the door! Art! Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, Chuck. Hold on, hold on. Where is she? Rebecca! Calm down. I know she's here I saw her car out front. (skull cracking) (suspenseful music) What will happen to him? He'll finally pay for what he's done. Look, don't you feel sorry for him. Jeanine's not the first person he's murdered. Mary? Yeah. Yeah, he got away with that one and he would have gotten away with this one too if you hadn't've found Jeanine's body in the trunk of that old Mustang. How do you know that? What? Where the body was. It was the first thing that you told me when you came in. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. I'm gonna try Lyle again. (suspenseful music) (phone beeping) [Answering Machine] You've reached the Deerfield Sheriff's office. I'm not in so leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. (machine beeps) Yeah, Lyle, it's Art again. Where are you, man? This situation here is serious. I need you to get to the Bar and Grill as soon as possible. (gasps) It's not always good to be so smart. I never told you where I found Jeanine's body. You wouldn't know that unless you put her there yourself. Sit down. Sit down! I did Jeanine a favor. She was miserable, and no one knew that more than me. It was a mercy killing. Pinning it on you that's the reward. Jeannine had to die so you'd finally get what's coming to you. I waited 20 years for him to pay for what he did to Mary. My Mary! The woman I loved and you took her away from me. Twice. First when you married her and then when you killed her. Yeah, you never fooled me with that phony accident. I was with you when they brought Mary up from the ravine. Remember? You never even shed a tear. Chuck didn't kill Mary. Leo did. Bullshit! Bullshit, it's bullshit! All I wanted is for you to take the fall for Jeanine. Bartok and Gromek they were supposed to find her body but they fucked up. Well, looks like we've got a change in plans here. Never a dull moment in Deerfield, Chuck. I'll have to take care of you myself. Now, she has to die too. You'll never get away with this. You called Lyle, he'll... And he'll what? He'll believe every word I tell him when he gets here. He'll believe every word. He'll believe Chuck killed Jeanine and you found her body. And then you tried to tell him and couldn't find him so you came to me for help. And then Chuck, he figured it all out, so he shows up like a fucking lunatic, busts in, grabs my gun, and kills you before I could stop him. And now, of course, I have to shoot you in self defense. Case closed. The money. The money, Chuck found it. Art, thousands of dollars and you can have it all. You can leave Deerfield and you can live really well forever. But if you kill us, then the money will be gone for good. You're lying. No, I'm telling you the truth. I'm telling you the truth but only Chuck knows where it is. (suspenseful music) Where is it? Let her go and I'll tell you. Not until the money's in my hands. (dramatic music) Do anything stupid and I start shooting. You understand? I understand. (sirens blaring) Damn! Pull over. Keep the motor running. (siren blaring) Hey, Lyle, what's up? Why don't you tell me? I don't know what you're talking about. What are you two doing out together at this hour? Is there something going on here I should know about? Whoa, Lyle, so many questions. (gun blasts) (Rebecca screams) Too many! Get the hell outta here! (Rebecca sobbing) Go, step on it! (tires screeching) Another murder you'll take the fall for, Chuck. By the time we're done you'll beg me to kill you. (suspenseful orchestral music) Get out and untie your husband. Try anything and she's dead. Where is it? In there, in a bag wedged up the chimney. Get it. (suspenseful orchestral music) Open it up, let's see. (dramatic music) Put it down. And you'll share this with Bartok and Gromek? Just put it down and step back. Chuck, give him the money. Listen to your wife, Chuck. (fist thuds) (Art groans) Get up! I said get up! You just give a reason to pull the trigger. I should give you what you gave Jeanine, a way out of your misery. Go ahead, shoot me. You always were a coward. I wish I could feel sorry for you. You're pathetic. Only a coward like you would kill Jeanine. - Chuck! - Drop the gun! Drop it! Wait a minute, Art. Stuart, what is this? I want to know what's going on here. He killed your wife. What? He killed Jeanine. Why the hell would I kill Jeanine? He's trying to frame Chuck to avenge Mary's death. That's a load of bull. Use your head, Stuart. She's his wife, she'll say anything to get him off the hook. It's the truth, he loved Mary, he never forgave Chuck for taking her away from him. Don't listen to her, Stu. She's lying, you know the truth as well as I do. He and Jeanine always had the hots for each other. Then why would he kill her? It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense because he's crazy. He's always been crazy. He told me what happened. He told me he got Jeanine alone and lost his temper and stabbed her over and over again. If you're hellbent on killing me you better do it now, but it won't change the truth. I never touched her. Art did it. He killed the sheriff too in cold blood. You've known me all my life, Stu. You know I could never do a thing like that. But you know he has to pay for what he's done. Then call the state police, let them handle it. You call them and it'll all be over. He'll walk away from Jeanine's murder just like he walked away from Mary's. Jeanine once told me that you had something to do with Mary's death. It wasn't me. It was Leo. Listen to him. Leo killed Mary. I killed Jeanine. Everybody's a killer but him. He's the murderer. And murderers deserve to die so shoot him! [Rebecca] No! What if he's wrong? What if I'm innocent? Can you look me in the eye and pull that trigger? Are you willing to take that chance? You should've listened to me, Stuart. (gun bangs) (screams) You're gonna be big news in the paper tomorrow. Front page. You killed four people before I could stop you. Oh, and thanks for the money. (gun blasts) (Rebecca screams) (Art gasps) Stuart, it's alright, just take it easy, okay? I'm sorry. Shh, it's okay. I'm going for help. Alright, Stuart, it's okay, buddy. It's alright, it's alright. We're gonna get you some help. Okay? (light orchestral music) I guess this is goodbye to your old hometown. Yup. Just one quick stop. I'll send you a check for Mrs. Ford burial as soon as I get back. I'll take care of everything. How's Stuart doing? Oh, he's gonna be okay. May take a little while but that shoulder should heal up just fine. Tell me, what do you think Leo did with that money? You think he even had it? Nothing Leo did would surprise me. Thanks for everything. Sure. Thanks, Jay. Take care of yourself, you hear? I found something in here that might interest you. [Rebecca] What is it? Last page. Read it. [Leo] The approach of death changes one in profound ways. In fact, the old me is already dead. It was that other man who hurt you, Chuck. And for the pain I caused you, for the happiness I've robbed you of, I will die broken and humbled, and yet not without hope. Hope that my passing can set you free. I'm very proud of you, Chuck. Proud of what you've become in spite of the ordeal of growing up with a father who lost his way long before you had a chance to find yours. For my transgressions I'm truly sorry, son. And I ask you and God to forgive me. There's nothing I can do to change the past but the future is in God's hands. I ask him to bless you and your new wife and give you the happiness and success you richly deserve. (light orchestral music) [Rebecca] I think we did the right thing giving that money back to Gromek and Bartok. [Chuck] Yeah. And Art finally got his share too. (light orchestral music)
