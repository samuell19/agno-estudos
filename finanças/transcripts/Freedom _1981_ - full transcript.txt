Sorry. - [Rachel] For what? - Messing up your life. - Oh. - [Libby] I am, aren't I? - I think you like to think you are. - I thought you'd be angry 'cause I got expelled. - What was it this time? - There's a rule about walking barefoot through town. You asked me, and I told you. - Well, what is it now, three schools, four? - Get off my case, will you. - [Rachel] Get off mine. What do you want me to say, Libby, give me a clue. - How's Jessie? Perfect as usual? - Yes. - And your friend? - Richard? Richard's all right, he's out of town for a few days. - Must be rough. I'm not going home. - Oh? Then what, I'd like to know your plans. - I wanna be free. - What does that mean? Right, you have to live somewhere, you have to go to school, you're not 16 yet. Free to what, Libby? I don't understand. - Live my life. - What does that mean? That's not good enough. - Oh yeah, right, of course. - Freedom's responsibility, that's what it is. - Means free of you, okay. Free of why don't you, why can't you, why aren't you. Well, why don't you? Why can't you, and why aren't you? I'm not gonna be Jessie for you, understand? - I don't want you to be. - Oh no? - No. - Well, I'm not going home. - Heard you the first time, dammit. - I'm not going home. - I don't see that you have much of a choice, Libby. - I'll just split again if you send me home. What's the point? I love you, Mom, I can't do it your way. I mess up, and we hassle, and I screw up your life, right? - Don't play into my guilt, Lib. It won't work anymore. - Libby, we could make you a ward of the court. Now, that means that you'd have to stay in Juvenile Hall until you were placed. I'd hate to see you do that. I mean, we had a youngster up there last week who had all of her teeth knocked out. I'm not trying to scare you, it's just a fact. Now, the other alternative is a halfway house. - [Libby] What's that? - [Officer] Well, you'd live with a family for a cooling off period, your mom would come up to see you from time to time. It's just a neutral ground where the two of you could work your problems out. - Maybe it's worth a try right now. - Can I make a call please? I wanna call my father. - He's not gonna take you. - Can I call my father, please? - There's the phone. Would you like to be alone? - Yes, please. Thank you. - Here you go. - [Libby] He wants to talk to you. - Excuse me. - You were wrong. He never puts me down. That's the difference between the two of you. - Whatever you say, Libby. - Know what he said? - I don't really care, Libby. - He said no daughter of mine is gonna be put in a halfway house. - Terrific. - He says he'll take full responsibility. He wants Libby with him. - Okay. Come on, Lib, I'll drive you back. - No, I'll... Thanks, I'm gonna go with Mr. Owens. - Oh, okay. - I love you, Mom, you know that. - I love you, do you know that? - It's better this way. You know how bad I wanna be with dad. I'll call you, okay? - Yeah, keep in touch. - I'm terribly sorry about all this. - Yeah, me too. - See, look. I'm glad everything is resolved. - Right. - You take care, honey. - [Libby] Okay, thanks for everything. - It's pretty rough on you, huh? - Mmm, I don't know about that, I guess. I did my share. - Can I get you anything else? - [Libby] No. That was fine, thank you. - Well, your dad meant to be here before you arrived. - This is okay. - Finally. Your dad is home. (both chatting faintly) How was your day? - It was good. Hey. - Hey. - Listen, I spent half my of life being thrown out of one school or another. Don't sweat it. - No, I won't. (chuckling) - You're not gonna make the cover of Vogue, kid. - Well, I'm leaving that for Jessie. - Come here. - What? - Well, you gonna kiss me, or what? - Or what, of course. (chuckles) - Will you be all right in here? - Fine, yeah. - It's an awfully tiny room. It's really claustrophobic. Used to be a sewing room, or something, and we haven't had a chance to fix it up yet. - [Libby] It's fine, thank you. - I'm gonna get a radio. Is that all right? - That'd be nice. Thanks. - [Jessie] Mom! - Yep! - They were kind to-- - Mama! - I'm working. - You want something, Rae? - Mom! - Did you call me? - [Rachel] No! Nevermind, Richard! - [Jessie] Libby's home! - What? - Michael's getting her stuff out of the trunk. Libby! Hi dad. - Hi. - Yo. How you doing, Rae? - Hello, Michael. - Hi mom. - [Rachel] Hi. You back? - No, not really, don't worry. - Don't do that, Lib. - [Michael] Where do you want this? - Right here for now, thanks. - Libby! - Hi. - Hi. - Still mince meat, huh? Skinny as ever. - Yeah. - Hi, baby. - Hi. - I'd like to know what's going on. - I'm gonna tell ya. How's it going? - Fine. - I'm gonna be out of town a few months, Copenhagen. So, you're gonna have to take over. - [Rachel] Why don't you take Libby with you? - You know that's impossible. - No, I don't know that at all. You told the officer that you-- - I would have told the cop anything to keep her out of that place. - Did he explain-- - I'm not interested. You would have let her go. - Christ sakes, it was someone's home. - [Michael] I don't know what's in your head sometimes. - Come on, Jessie. (sighs deeply) - What, do you really need to punish her, or what? - Will you ever listen to anything? - Listen? (dog barking) I don't know what you've been doing the last 10 years, however many years you've had to mess her up the way she is. But you've done one hell of a job. - Right, right, single-handedly. - But you're not gonna put any of this on me. All I know... All I know is that I get a call whenever there's a crisis. That's the only time I ever hear from you. - I thought you might wanna know that your daughter had disappeared. - No, I don't wanna know that. I don't wanna be handed the mess. - I didn't hand you the mess. - And I always help, don't I? - It's impossible. - [Michael] Hey you, don't give me that. I always help, don't I? - You're a brick. You're not even calling me about-- - What's the problem here? - Oh, what's up, Richard? - Michael. Well, the Rams are getting killed by 20 points. - [Rachel] Libby's back. - Oh? Well, good. - [Michael] So, do you wanna talk or what? - Uh, look, why don't you guys just-- - This is no secret. You might as well be part of it, Richard. Libby? Now, Libby knows she has to finish school. And that's a given, we've been over all that. But she wants her own apartment. She wants to try living on her own. I think it's worth a try. She won't live here. - How do you plan to do that, Lib? - Well, the deal is she passes with no worst than Cs, I give the child support directly to her. - Can you live on 150 a month, Libby? - Yeah, sure. - "Yeah, sure?" Where do you plan to go to school? - [Libby] In Ojai. - Ojai? - The public school. I got a lot of friends there. It's safe, it's a small town. You can walk down the street at night, and nobody's gonna bug you, you know. It's okay. - Well, am I supposed to talk now? Am I supposed to say what I think? Because I think the whole idea is crazy. I mean, I don't even know if it's legal. You're still a child. - Maybe legally. - You're still a child. - I was on my own when I was 14. - We're not talking about you. - What do you wanna do? Lock her up? 'Cause that's what you're gonna have to do, and I won't let you do it. - Okay, you take responsibility then. - Hell no! You have custody, this is a mess you made. This is your responsibility. - I don't want you guys to fight. - You're my best, babe. You two are gonna have to work this out. You let my attorney know whatever. I love you. Everything's gonna be okay. - Thanks. Have a good trip. - [Michael] Listen, if you need anything, I can be reached, right? - Right. I'll walk you to your car. - [Michael] Richard. - See you. - [Michael] Good luck, huh? - [Richard] Rae, listen to-- ♪ Every dark corner is another man's dream ♪ ♪ Do you know ♪ ♪ Do you know ♪ ♪ Dream ♪ ♪ You know what I mean ♪ ♪ Dream to me ♪ - Is that one of yours? It's nice, I wanna hear some more. - It's all I have. I haven't finished it yet. - I think they're really good. Your songs, I mean. As good as I've heard. Really special. - Yeah, well, you know, they're all about me. - Not all. - Yeah, they are. They're either about me or for me, one of the two. You don't give a damn about Dad, do you? You know how bad that hurts him? - Don't start on me, Libby. - What? - I mean, I hardly know him. - Well, you never call him. - He never calls me. He's my father. He should call me, don't you think? - No, I don't. You're mama's girl, all right, you're like a parrot. You haven't a thought that isn't hers. - It's not true. - Ha! Not true, huh? It's okay, you're my baby sister, I love you anyway. - I thought you were asleep. You wanna talk? Hmm? - I'm the enemy. Can you believe it? Or still I feel like the enemy. - Let her go, Rachel. - I can't. - Let her go. - She's a baby. - She's not, Rae, and she's tearing you up and herself up. You can't hold her. She'll end up tearing us up. She's not gonna let it go. - (crying) Don't throw us in the middle, but please give me a break. I can't just throw her out into the world. - She's already gone. Give her a chance to find her way back. - You can come up with such garbage sometimes. It's like she's racing head on into a brick wall, and I keep on throwing myself in her way, and she just rolls right on over and there's nothing I could do to stop her. (crying) (mellow guitar music) (Rachel crying) (laughing) - Yeah, yeah. - Oh god, girl, let's try one. - Let's do one. - [Man] I got an open door out here, boys and girls. - [Man] Hang on a second, we gotta change reels. - [Man] Get in the club, Joe. - Are we making any noise? - In the state of California, you can be legally emancipated at the age of 14 with proof of support and parental consent. Now, what I've drawn up here is an informal document that'll save you the trauma of court appearances. It's not legally binding, you understand, but it'll allow you to register at school, get an apartment, sign hospital consents. You'll have all the responsibilities of an adult, you understand?

I'm never gonna-- - Get something, will you, Libby? Make her happy. - Well, take these out, they don't fit. - [Rachel] Oh. Oh. (Libby clears throat) - Thank you. (laughing) - [Jessie] Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. I love you. - It was good, huh? - Yeah, it was nice. It was good being together. I like to pretend that that she's all right. - Well, maybe she is. - Maybe. It was nice. It was pretty warm, great family. You should come up with us. - No, I shouldn't. Let me make an honest woman of you. - No thanks. Didn't much like it the first time. - Rachel, marry me. - You know, you should see someone about your timing, you know that? - My timing's always gonna be wrong, isn't it? - I don't wanna fight, you wanna fight? - What I want is some footing around here. We have to be some sort of family. - Aren't we? - You know damn well we're not. You keep this relationship very, very separate. - It's not fair. - You bet it's not. - I've got my own life in shape before I can take on someone else. - (chuckles) You'll never get your life in order. You thrive on chaos. - I don't, I hate it. - You thrive on it all the same. And Libby is her mother's daughter. - Oh yes, and Jessie? - Don't kid yourself. Jessie stays out of the line of fire. She protects herself at all times. - You stink. I don't think I like you. - I can leave whenever you want. - You'll find your way out on your own stink. - I'm not going until you tell me to. - All right, go. Go. Go. Go. Go! - Tomorrow okay? - Tomorrow's fine. Never. (muffled rock music) - Throw a pie at me? - Wanna give it a try? ♪ Always be the grown one ♪ - Come on, one stop, plus five.

They've come for me a couple of times. I just come on back. I've spent some really rotten nights in some of those tanks waiting for my mom to come and get me. Never again. - Bill doesn't like me very much, does he? - Hey, that's Bill. I mean, he takes everybody's life serious. I mean, like me. He and Ron are like brothers, and Ron falls in love every two minutes. And, I mean, it's real when it happens, but well, he's just head over heels every two seconds. And we got a spinner trailing with a sign at the next spot, and he doesn't know what to do, so Bill ends up putting her on a bus and getting her home. - Why don't you just tell the girl to come on out, and save us all a lot of trouble. - There's no one here but me. - Look, her mom wants her home, and I've got to take her in. - Do you have a warrant? - Why do you want to get your nose into this? - There's no one here but me. And you're not invited in, so you don't have a warrant. - Don't need a warrant. - Hey, this is my house, man. You can not come in here. It's against the law to do this. - You want law, okay. I've reasonable proof and knowledgeable evidence that you are harboring a runaway. You're gonna be in a lot of trouble, you know that. - No, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble, man. - [Officer] Amanda, right? Come on.

What'd you expect? - Nothing, nothing anymore. - I didn't do nothing. - Well, you know how to speak English, Lib. What are you doing, trying to impress me, or what? - I didn't do anything, all right. Why don't you talk to the counselor. I mean, did you talk to him? - Harboring a runaway, obstructing an officer, resisting arrest. - What about what he did, man? He broke the law like six times over. He's breaking and entering, he didn't have a warrant. He jumped on Amanda-- - We're talking about you now. - You never let me finish. You never listen. - It's always someone else's fault, right? Well, you listen to me. You wanna be free? You have to take responsibility for what you do. - Don't give me that junk. Don't preach at me. - Don't you talk to me like that. - Why don't you just go back to your perfect house and your perfect daughter, wonderful lover, and all your important work. Just forget about me, okay. Right now, if you already have, anyway. - You really know what buttons to push, don't you? Just once, it'd be nice to hear an apology come out of that mouth. - I didn't do anything wrong. - All right, let's add truancy to that, and $200 worth of bad checks. You didn't think I knew about that, did you? - I'll take care of it. Don't worry, you won't have to pay it. - Don't worry, I won't anymore. - Big deal. (scoffs) - Listen, everything I do is wrong. I accept that, okay. But what you don't wanna see is that your life is going straight into the toilet. - Of course you'd say that. Why don't you just go back 200 years and drag up some more stuff, to the day I was born. Put me out somewhere and tell me I'm exactly like dad. Go to hell. Perfect. Perfect. I was maced! I got maced, don't you care? I'm your daughter. Dad would have a fit on me and he'd tear this place apart. - And where is he, Libby? Why isn't he here, Libby? - Because this is your mess. You got custody. - Not anymore, remember? You wanted to be on your own, well you got it. - Don't say anything bad about my father. - (scoffs) I wouldn't dare. - [Libby] What happened to Amanda? - The girl? She's back home, I guess. - They're not gonna make me stay here, are they? - No, they're not pressing charges. - Well, they're not gonna make me go with you, are they? I wanna get back to Ojai as soon as possible. - No, I don't think they can make you do anything. You can leave whenever you want. - Okay then, see ya. - Oh boy. You too, huh? (upbeat music) - Who's that? - Where? - The guitar? - [Ron] Oh man. - I hope she stays. It's somebody for you to jam with. - Ron. Hi. - Yeah, hi. How ya doing? - Libby from Ojai, remember? - Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. - I'm Sherri, hi. - Hi. - So, how you been? - Okay. All right. - Amanda back? - Uh, no, no. What the hell you doing here? - I thought you wanted me here. - Did I say that? Did, um, you ever hear me say that? - No, it's-- - Libby, I'm sorry. I don't have old ladies tonight. I don't want old ladies. - [Sherri] I'm his old lady. - [Ron] Libby, why don't you, uh, get on a bus, and-- - Hey, hey Ron? - Go back home. - Ron. Cool it, huh? - [Libby] I messed up. My fault. I messed up. - No, he messed up. It's his fault. He's just... He's just mad at himself, that's all. Doesn't wanna grow up. Listen, if, if you don't have enough money for the bus fare, I can probably scrounge it up for you. - I can't go back. I need a job. - You don't wanna work here, though. (sighs) All right. Take you to the boss is all I can do. - You got a work permit? - I got this. - You know, I really don't need anybody for just the, uh, just the one spot. No, I'd love to sing. - Yeah? - [Libby] Yeah. - Okay. Better get your spot to spot on your own steam. Okay, you can cart a ride with one of the trucks, or one of these bum cars, but... Cathy, go help Linda, she's an airhead. Right now! If you want comfort, you can thumb, all right, with a buddy. Anyway, it's your headache. If you're late, you're fined. If you're drunk or stoned on the job, you're fined. First time, all right. Happens again, you're canned, thrown off the midway. Okay? You're one hour on, one hour off. At the end of the night, you can't leave the midway at all. You wear jeans and a shirt. If you're caught wearing tank tops, or something like that, you're fined, okay. You get, uh... You're getting any of this? (laughing) - Yeah. (people shouting) - [Carnie] We got a winner! (people shouting) (upbeat music) - Lib! Take a break. (people shouting) (upbeat music) - [Woman] Come on, let's go. And three. Three for a dollar, three for a dollar, that's the mark. How many do you want, sonny? - One. - Only one? - That's, uh, that's Mama J. She's older than God. She goes into her ticket booth every morning with a coffee container, and never comes out till closing. Friends? - If you want. - Good. Good. I gotta get back to the joint. You okay? - Yeah. (upbeat music) Hey. Thanks. - What for? We're all family here. (upbeat music) (people shouting) - [Man] Party time! - [Woman] Party time! Party time! - Hey! (kids screaming) - I woke you, didn't I? - No. Libby? - I'm okay. Just calling to tell you that I'm okay 'cause you'd be worried. I'm not dead or anything. I'm working with the carnival, and I love it. I'm really happy here for the first time in my life. Be happy for me, okay. I love you. Mom? - Yes. Just give it a second to sink in. (chuckles) - I love you, mom. Is Jessie there? I'd like to talk to her. - [Rachel] Jessie, your sister's on the phone. - Libby, hi! How are you, where are you? - I'm with the carnival. - [Jessie] Really? How exciting, it must be fun. - It's fantastic. Carnies are fantastic. I'd like you to come up and visit me sometime. - Really? I'd love that. - I gotta go. Tell mom I love her and tell her I'll call her later. - I'm still on the line. How can I get in touch with you? It's hard 'cause we're moving all the time, but I'll call you. And I'm really happy, mom, really. - [Rachel] Well, that's something. - Okay then. - [Jessie] Bye, Lib. - Bye. - Love you. (dial tone buzzes) She's joined the circus. (laughing) Not funny. - I think it's wonderful. (laughing) - [Sherri] Hey, you ready now? One in wins. On your break? - Yep. It's slow, huh? - [Sherri] The worst. Made a buck and a half in the last two hours. It'll pick up. - [Libby] Can I get you anything? - [Sherri] No, uh-uh. - [Libby] Well, how are you feeling? - Fine. Heavy. (chuckles) Kid moves like crazy. Kicks me all night long. Kicked Ron last night. - So what, you gonna marry him? - No, I don't think so. Ron doesn't want any kids, and I do, of course. I can't wait. - But you love him. - Everybody loves Ron. I could never be possessive, you know. I don't believe in it. And Ron wouldn't put up with it. We're friends now, and that's good. I wouldn't wanna fool around with that. You can't understand that, can you? - No. I mean, it's his baby. - It's my baby. Ron's gonna pick up on another chick, soon. I can feel it. No use getting torn up about it. We all gotta live together, right? You know why you never hear a carnie put down someone else's old lady? Because sooner or later, she's gonna be his old lady. You can't understand that 'cause you want someone crazy in love with you. You want ownership, you want forever. Hey. Hey! Ron likes you a lot! - Ah! - He thinks you're talented. And you are. ♪ Yes, I cry myself to sleep ♪ (upbeat music) - Hey, what's the matter? Come on, don't you like me? - What are you doing, man? Get lost. Where's your dime? - Hey, be nice. Come sweetheart, come here. Come here. - Get off this counter. - Relax, huh? - Get off the counter. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. The lady's trying to work, okay. We're not supposed to sit on the counter anyway. Let's go. - Hey, why don't you take a hike. - Get off the counter! Come on. I got him, I got him, get off, get over here. I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him. You okay? - Are you? - [Bill] Terrific. - [Carnie] We got a winner! - So, by all powers vested in me by the state of California, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. (everyone cheering) - Hold on, hold on. Back down. You okay? They gotta go around three times before it's legal. It's just tradition.

Come here. Come closer, I won't bite you. Do they say I bite? - No. - All right, then. Now come over here and sit down. I said sit down. Now. Do you know who I am? - Papa J? - Old Man Johnson, Papa J. Do you know how old I am? - 92? - 92. And all this is mine. Every bit of it. Yes sir. Now, you know what a mark is? - Anyone who ain't a carnie? - Well, partial. You know the story about the train mule? - No. - See, this man advertises he's got a train mule for sale. You ever come across a train mule? - No. - Well, this clown who comes along, and he buys the mule. Now, he's back in a week because he can't get that jackass to do a damn thing. Well the man says, "Well, that's impossible." The farmer says, "Oh yeah?" So he tells the mule, "Sit down! "Stand up! "Walk!" Nothing happens, right? Well, the man says, "No wonder." So, he reaches back till he gets a two-by-four, and he wallops that mule right across the eyes with it. Then he says, "First, you gotta get his attention." (laughing) Now, that's what a mark is. 'Cause all those people out there live their lives getting smacked across the face with a two-by-four. You have got to learn how to duck them two-by-fours, little lady. Understand? Check. - Yeah, check. (upbeat fiddle music) - So. You girls are going to Red Bluff, huh? - No. I don't think so. Twins, can you imagine? - You okay? - Terrific. Sit down. Did you see them? - Nope, not yet. - They're gorgeous. Gorgeous. - Who can I call, can I call anyone? - You can call my mother. - Oh, I'll get that, wait. Who else? - Tell her to come get me, okay? - She won't be angry, or anything? - No. I don't think. I mean, after all, it's your mother, for God's sake. Would yours? - Be angry? I'm not sure what my mother would think. - Anyway, mine was always looking forward to grandchildren to keep her occupied. Well, she's got them. (laughing) It's a miracle, huh? (muffled voices echoing) - Hi there. I'm Wizard. Uh, sorry about looking so grubby, but, we came to L.A. to pick up some stock, and, been loading the truck all day. Libby! - Mom. - [Rachel] How'd you get in? - Don't I get a kiss first? We haven't seen each other around 100 years. - [Rachel] You know I don't like surprises. - Yeah, you do. This is Wizard. - We met. - [Libby] And this is Bill. This is my mom. - Hi. - I think I might have given your mom a start. I think I scared her a little. - We came into L.A. to pick up some stuff. Thought it'd be a good chance to see you. - How'd you get in? - Mom, there's about a zillion ways to get in to this house if you want to. You ought to do something about it, you know. I mean, anybody could break in. It's kind of dangerous. So, where is everybody? Where's Jessie? - She's out shopping with friends. - (chuckles) Figures. What about you, what are you doing? You're working hard? - Yeah. They want it yesterday, of course. You left the kitchen a mess. We don't have anybody to clean up. - Oh, what happened to the last one? - What difference does it make? - None, I guess. These are my friends. - Yeah, I understood that. - [Bill] We were loading a truck all day, that's why we're so... Libby jumped right in and helped us. We're not always quite this messy. - We can even look human when we want to. - Yeah, she just thought that maybe we could, you know, come here... You don't want us to. - No, it's just a little bit of a shock to see strange people in your home. - People? This is me, these are my friends. - Come on, Lib, I can-- - No, it's rotten. I told them they could come here. I told them they could clean up and take showers. I said you wouldn't mind. - How could you think that? No, I mean... Go ahead if that's what you told them. - Maybe we should-- - It's so unfair. - No, of course. If that's what you want, take showers. I mean, why don't you show them the rest of the house, if you haven't already. - You're really glad to see me, aren't you, Mom? - Yes, as a matter of fact I am. That's the silly part. - I called Dad, he was out of town again. - [Rachel] Oh. - Come on, the showers are upstairs. Come on. - [Richard] You know, if I wanted to be alone, I could have gone into another room. - Yeah, I suppose. - Well, either the pope just died, or you've heard from Libby. (laughing) - Yeah, she dropped by. - Oh. Well, that's nice. - [Rachel] Quit it. - Well, how's she doing? - I don't know. - Well how did she seem? - Cut it out. Lousy, awful, we were both awful. Pushed her farther away. - [Richard] I doubt that. - I fell back on all my old stuff. I'm terrific. - You know, you two are so hooked into each other, it's pathetic. - Nobody asked you. - Tough. You two are a team. You oughta go on the road with that act of yours. You let go with one hand, you strangle hold with the other. Where you going? I wanna talk to you. - I don't wanna talk about this. I think we're gonna have to keep this separate. - Well, I don't think I can. - She's my daughter, you understand? She's my fault. - Yeah, well, that's the problem, isn't it? That's all you see is your daughter, and she sees her mother. And neither of you see each other, or want to. Look, you're people, got it? You got flaws just like the rest of us, and neither of you is gonna live up to the other one's fantasy. Now, you're not gonna get another crack at those 16 years. So, live with it. Leave the kid alone. She's doing the best she can. - Is she? - Yeah. Not the best you can, because she's not you. She's Libby. And she's 16. (sighs) Give the kid a break, and yourself, and Jessie, and, uh, me too. Okay? - You finished? Can I go now? - Rae, I'm not gonna be sacrificed to this crazy ritual dance the two of you are doing. - Right. (door slams) (sighs deeply) - She's young, your mom. - Not so young. She's pretty, huh? - Yeah, okay. - I think she's pretty. - It's quite a house. - Yeah. - Don't know why you'd wanna leave. - Oh, no? You try living there awhile. - Come on, Lib, you gotta admit we look pretty raunchy. I know how much I wanna walk through my front door and see us all sitting there drinking my booze. - No, that's her. We're allergic to each other. (laughing) - That's funny. - When I was a kid, she was gone all the time, you know. She's a big time journalist, so they were always sending her all over the place. I got expensive gifts, clothes. I didn't want them. I never wanted them. They got divorced, that got even worse. I always hated being rich. - It's not a crime. - I ain't so sure. It does lousy things to people. I don't want to talk about it anymore. - [Bill] Okay. - I just thought... I don't know. I don't know what I thought. - Want some company? You wanna be alone? - I don't know. No. - This is where I live. - I gotta feed Joe. - I'm sure Whiskey fed Joe. I think he's asleep or something. - Yeah, (clears throat) yes. - Keep you company, if you like. - Yeah, okay. - Not much of a housekeeper, but it's home. You wanna sit down? Wanna talk? - We just sit here. Sit here quiet with you. - Okay. - I need someone of my own so bad. - [Woman] One in wins! (people shouting) (upbeat music) - Papa? Papa? Bill! Papa? Get Bill! Papa J? - Bill? Bill! - [Brett] Bill. - [Bill] Papa J's okay, right? He looks dead. - But I think he's still breathing. - Go get Sam or Kenny, come on. - Let's just get in the van. - Quick, move, come on! - What happened? What happened? - [Brett] He just toppled over, Link. - Help me get him up. - I think we should leave him here, Link. - Help me get him up. Help me get him up. (baby crying) - [Man] Come on, Link, you can come too if you want. - It's not a holiday. 11:30. Come on, everybody. Let's, let's got to work. Let's open up. - It's not the end of the world, folks, let's go. (sirens blaring) - I, I, I, I've got to open up. - Relax, we'll take care of you. - But I've got to open up. I've got to. - To Papa J. - [All] Papa J. - To Sherri. - [All] Sherri. - To the twins. Damn. - Don't do that. The man was 92 years old. He died exactly where he wanted to be watching his show. Everything he was looking at when he died belonged to him. - My dad's dead. - I could go for some of that myself. - Let's take it easy, okay? - [Man] That is real pretty hair.

Let's quit, huh Libby? - [Libby] Do you think this is what Jessie wants? Jessie didn't want this. - Jessie likes Richard; she loves him. - Well, she'd say anything she thought would make you happy.
