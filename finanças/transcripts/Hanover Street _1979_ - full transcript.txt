Oh, my God, it's the baby. Oh. Are you all right? I'm frightfully sorry. It appears you've missed your bus. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't... You missed your bus. - I don't own a bus. - I'll buy you one. Oh, how nice, a rich Yank. No thank you. Well, if you don't want a bus, would you like a cup of coffee? I don't drink coffee. I drink tea. There probably won't be another bus along here for quite some time. Probably not. You really drink this stuff, don't you? No, we just like to pour it into cups and stir it. Why did you ask? Tastes too much like boiled water. It is boiled water. I knew there was a reason. Where are you from? - Chicago. - Chicago. That's where gangsters come from, isn't it? Not all of them. Some of them come from Detroit, New York. Chicago happens to grow the best ones. - Are you a gangster? - Twelve arrests, no conviction. Nobody's supposed to look like that in a uniform. - Well, how am I supposed to look? - Like a short man. Your boiled water is getting cold. Well, then let's order some more. Please. All right. What about you? What about... what about me? Who are you? What are you? I'm a short man. I was born in London. I lived here all my life and most probably always will. - What do you do here? - I work in a hospital. I tell young men that they're going to be all right. Then they believe me because they want to. Because they're so young. Then, I watch them die. I want it to all end. I'll win the war for you. That would be nice. Are you stationed in London? No. Our base is an hour and a half from here. Normally, I get a day every couple weeks. - You're a pilot? - Yeah, Mig-25s. Do you like to fly? I hate to walk. My name's Halloran. What's yours? Tell me about America. I think you're lovely. Tell me about Chicago. Chicago's very windy. Something is happening here. - Please don't. - Please don't what? - I have to go. - I don't want you to go. - I shouldn't be here. - Yes, you should. I have to go. - I have to catch the bus. - Please don't leave like this. - I have to. - I wanna see you again. I can't. Oh, please. I just have a few hours before I have to be back. Please don't do this to me. We got to get into a shelter. - I can't. I really can't. - Why? You're trying to go away again, but I'm not gonna let you. I'm not gonna let you. I can't think. I have to go home now. - I'll take you there. - No, you can't. I have to go. Hey, my name's Halloran. David Halloran. I'm from Chicago. I'm not gonna let you go. - Tell me your name. - I'm sorry. You're in my arms, you won't tell me your name? - Oh, please, let me go. - I have to see you again. My next day off is in two weeks, Thursday. - I can't. - Meet me here. Right here. - No. - On the same corner. - Right here. - I won't be here. I will. I'll be here all day. Please don't. I won't come. I'll be here. You can't act like nothing's happened. There's not enough time. It's too late. Now, the objective this morning in this airfield... north, north-east of Rouen. Reconnaissance showed we didn't do too well here last night. These dark circles here are fuel storage tanks. Now, they're under concrete, so it will take more than one direct hit to knock them out. Now again, the recon photos Show they didn't take even one direct hit. Now, we'll approach from the east. We'll have the sun at our backs and in their eyes. - Now, they've got two fighters. - How come he says, "We"? He's not going. We're "we." We can expect light to moderate flack. We'll approach from 12,000. The cloud cover is 6 to 8,000. We'll drop at 6,000. I wish I were going with you. We'll stay, and you can go. Lieutenant Halloran, something you wanna say? No, sir. I'm sure none of us want to miss whatever it is you have to add, Lieutenant. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir, what, Lieutenant? Yes, sir, I'm sure that none of us would like to miss anything I have to add, sir. Except, I don't have anything to add, sir, so there's nothing for any of us to miss, sir. Take-off is at 08:00. Good luck, gentlemen. Light to moderate flack. What the hell is light to moderate flack? Less than heavy flack. It's more than no flack. You got a point there. He wishes he could go with us. Well, somebody's got to stay behind to volunteer us. - This is radio check. - Pilot to tail. Farrell, okay? Everything's fine, sir. Radio's okay. Ammo's okay. Radio check. Pilot to waist. Giler? Yes, sir? How we doing? All set, sir. Radio's okay. Ammo's okay. Radio check. Pilot to turret. Lucas? Yes, sir. Ready, sir. Ammo's okay. Radio's okay. - Bomb bay closed? - Bomb bay closed. - Flaps locked? - Flaps locked. Cimino. I don't understand it. They make it so goddamn hard to get in these things. I don't even want to be here in the first place. I mean, I can understand them making it hard to get out. Everybody wants to get out. You know these things are made of metal, right? Did you ever try and pick one up? - You can't. - You know why? Because it's made of metal and metal's heavy. Very heavy. You don't believe me? Just try and pick one of these things up. You'll see. You'll wrench your back, that's what you'll do. Air isn't heavy, you know? This pile of junk is heavy. It's heavier than air. Much heavier. Don't you see? This thing is not supposed to be up in the air. Aw, Jesus, I hate these things. Pacer Leader to Pacer Group, we are 20 miles from target. Descending to 6,000. Bombs away at 6,000. Roger, Pacer Leader. Descending to 6,000. This is Pacer Leader to Group, maintain your positions. We are 12 miles from target. Rate of descent... 1,000 feet per minute. Hey, they're shooting guns at us. Somebody forgot to tell the Germans... they're only supposed to have light to moderate flack today. Bomb bay open. Six miles to target. Feather it. - Number two feathered. - Let's turn the hell back. How far from target? Five miles. Let's turn the hell back. He's right. We'll have to slow to 200. We'll be sitting ducks at that speed. We're gonna get our asses shot off. How far from target? Three miles. Am I the only one who's not crazy here? Hey, Cimino, you ever take a look at Hyer? If there's a god, he doesn't spend all that time putting a guy like Hyer... through prep school and Yale to let him do something messy like die in an aeroplane. So, as long as we're in the same plane as Hyer, God's gonna have to figure another way to get at us. Yeah, I'm messy enough to take Hyer down with me. We're over the target. We're over the target. The wing is gonna fall off. I'm gonna drop the bombs. Let's get the hell out of here. Just a second. Son of a bitch, we're over the target. The engine's falling off. Hey, Chief, what do you think? Well, I think it'll hold if you wanna wait. Terrific. We've got Sergeant York on the plane. I hate you, Lucas, goddamn it. Look, we're over the goddamn target. I'm gonna drop the bombs. Let me drop the bombs. We're over the target, I swear to God. My guess is you may be sighting a little bit early... because you're afraid the wing's gonna fall off, so I'm gonna wait just a few more seconds. If anyone's interested, I hate Lieutenant David Halloran, Serial Number 057327... 9-6-9. For God's sake, let him drop the bombs. If we don't hit the stupid target now, we're gonna have to come back again. Okay, now we're really over the goddamn target. Well, drop the bombs. They're away. Oh, Jesus, I hate these things. I was there on the hollow of the Street for over an hour, just watching you. I was afraid, so I stayed where you couldn't see me. Are you still afraid? Yes. It wasn't a few minutes ago when we had something to do like driving or walking, but now I just feel awkward again. I don't know what I'm doing here. Yes, you do. Yes, I do. I'm not hungry any more. Neither am I. I can get back to London next Thursday. Yes. - Tell me your name. - I can't. - Please. - No, I'm frightened. It's all happening so fast. I bet your name is really... Fred, and you're embarrassed. Hey, Fred... I think I love you. Yes. Pacer Leader to Pacer Group, we are 20 miles from target. Begin your descent now. Bombs away at 8,000 feet. Ten thousand. Open bomb bays. Bomb bays open. Hey, they're shooting guns at us again. How come every time we fly over them, they shoot guns at us? Because we drop bombs on them. They have no sense of humour. Can't you guys take a joke? - Nine thousand. - Five miles to target. How far is target now? Three miles. - Altitude? - 8,500. We're just about over the target. Altitude? 8,200. 8,100. - Cimino, drop them. - Now? They're away. Halloran, I love you. There is a god. There really is a god. Ladies and gentlemen, there really is a god. I'm gonna go to church as soon as we get back. Oh, I haven't been there in a little while. What kind of babies do you get when you cross a parakeet with a tiger? I give up. What kind of babies? I don't know, but when he sings, you better listen. You think that's terribly funny, don't you? Yes. You're a wretched little child. - If I am, it's your fault. - Really? Why? Mrs Thomas said today that Children are the reflection of their parents. Do you think that's true? I don't know. If it is, how come Dennis Caine... doesn't have a moustache like his father? He's a reflection of his mother. Dennis calls his mother and father by their names. I think that's smashing. Oh, you do. I'm getting a little too old to keep on calling you Mummy and Daddy. You don't call me Mummy and Daddy. You call me Daddy. I'm serious. I think from now on I shall call you Paul. If that's what you'd like. Yes, Paul, that's what I would like. I think that from now on I shall call you Margaret. And I think from now on I shall call you Rover. I think I'll call you Mummy. For a very short person, you're not bad at all. - Do you like more tea? - Yes, Love some. Judy Fox stole my key chain, the one with the four-leaf clover. - Stole it? - Yes. How do you know she stole it? I brought it to school... I always carry it... and when I was getting changed after hockey, I couldn't find it. And then later, she had it. When I told her it was mine, she said she always had it. I wasn't the only person who had a four-leaf clover key chain. And I know it's mine. She's really a nit. Everybody's supposed to be nice to her just because her father died. When did her father die? A few months ago. He was in the hospital. She said it was her key chain, and it isn't. I'm glad you're intelligent and you won't get killed. I'm in Intelligence. I'm not intelligent. And you should be especially kind to her now. You won't die, will you, Daddy? I thought you were gonna call me Paul? - Promise me. - I promise you. - And you will always love me? - I will always love you. - And you will always love Mummy? - I will always love Mummy. - Even when you're 80? - Yes. I will have to take my false teeth out of the glass... and put them in my mouth to kiss her. Now, we're going back to Rouen today. I think I'm going to be sick. We have reason to believe the Krauts are sending a train of ammunition from Rouen, south. Now, they're gonna be expecting us. It's not gonna be easy. We reckon we'll get a lot of flack. I'm definitely gonna be sick. Halloran, you fly lead. Patman, you fly second lead. Now, we got cloud cover from 8-10,000. Scattered clouds from 15,000. You make your drop at 6,000. Now, I know what it's going to be like, so be careful. "He knows what it's gonna be like." He flew 100 missions over Lackland, Texas, and he knows what it's gonna be like. Now, we should have five to ten-mile visibility below 8,000, and you make your approach from south to north. You got to hand it to him, nobody ever took Texas while he was there. Take-off is at 0830. Good luck, men. I wish I could have gone with you. Dismissed. Lieutenant Halloran, I'd like to speak with you for a moment. Take it easy with him. Don't say anything you'll regret later. Don't take it easy with him. Say something you'll regret later. Maybe we'll get grounded. Sit down, Lieutenant. You know, in every group of men, there's always one man... the others look to for leadership. Now, in this group, you happen to be that man. You set a good example, the others will follow. You know, you've got the makings of a very fine officer. You could go far. You could go very far. It's your attitude that concerns me. Now, you understand what I'm saying? No, sir. I don't like you either, buster. Now, you stop crapping around in the briefings, you understand? No, sir. What do you mean, "No."? No, sir. I don't understand, sir. What's "crapping around," sir? You're a wiseass. You even say "sir" like a wiseass. How should I say "sir," sir? I'm gonna get you. That's what I'm gonna do. Blink the wrong way and I'm gonna nail you. Do you understand? Yes, sir, you're gonna nail me. Will you get the hell out of here? - You okay? - Yeah. What did he say? He said he didn't like my attitude. - Lucas, did you check this gear? - I checked it, sir. I checked all of them like I always do. Tyre pressure? Fine, sir? What's the matter, sir? You've never done this before. Check them again. I like this attitude. It's different, but it's one fine attitude. When I was a little girl, I used To spend summers at my grandfather's. - It looked exactly like this. - You worked on a farm? - Yes, why? - I don't know. You just don't seem like the farm type to me. I can milk a cow. - Her Ladyship can milk a cow? - She can. - With her very own hands? - No, with her feet. Why do you find it so incredible that I can milk a cow? Lots of people can. Haven't you ever milked one? I opened a bottle once. Don't they drink milk in Chicago? Sure. How do you think baby Gangsters grow up to be big gangsters? There's a place to eat over there. You hungry? - Famished. - Good. So am I. I want some tea. I love tea. - Did I ever tell you that? - No. Well, it's true. I drink it all the time. Halloran? Yes. I love you. My name is Margaret. No kidding? No kidding. You love me? I love you. Your name's Margaret? My name's Margaret. Maggie. I love the name Maggie. I can't stop it, you know, no matter how hard I try. It terrifies me how much I want you. It must be wrong to want somebody this urgently. I know later that I'll feel guilty. Later, I'll hurt terribly. Except I'm with you now And that's all I can think about. I love you, Margaret. I love you, Halloran. Captain Sellinger, I believe you've met Captain Lester? Yes, sir, I have. New tobacco. Do you like it? Yes, it seems quite pleasant. Aromatic. Bad business. Very bad. - I Beg your pardon? - Captain Lester. As you know, two months ago, one of your agents, Reed, was dropped in Lyons. - Two weeks later, he was killed. - Yes? A month ago, you sent another agent in. - Forbes. A good man. - Quite. Yesterday, we received word That Forbes has been found dead. What do you think? I trained both of those men. I knew them well. Very well. They... They were not the kind of men to make mistakes. Especially mistakes so glaring they would be found out in two or three weeks. There's a leak. There has to be a leak somewhere. The identity of those men had to have been known before they were dropped. It would take that long just to find them. There's a double agent here, fairly high up, I'd say. It's the only explanation I can have. I agree. The last communication we received from Forbes... was that, Gestapo headquarters in Lyons... has a list of double agents in London. He said he was going to get that list. That's the last we heard from him. This stuff is bloody awful. It may smell good. It tastes like hell. Well, it's obvious we're going to have to send somebody in to get that list. In Gestapo headquarters in Lyons? That's where the list is. That's where our man will have to go. - He had three children. - Did you say something? I was saying that Forbes had three children. Yes. It's obvious we're going to have to do this differently this time. No one, I mean no one outside of this room may know of it. No one in O.S.S. No one in G-2. No one. Our man can't even transmit the list back. Once he gets it, he must make a copy of it and bring it back without the Germans knowing about it. - Who do we have? - I've narrowed the list to two... McCallum and Wells. - I say Wells. - Quite right. - You will work with him. - I'm not sure if he's ready. You make him ready. Oh, that's better. They can take that aromatic and put it in their noses. Oh, God, I think I'm going to die. - Of what? - Look, Mummy, - isn't she beautiful? - Yes, she is. Isn't she the most beautiful thing you ever saw? No. Who's more beautiful than she is? You are. She can close her eyes, and you can curl her hair. Yes, she's a wonderful doll. Let's think of what to get Daddy for Christmas. I suppose there's no reason in particular that you wanted me to see that doll. No reason in particular. It has nothing to do with Christmas? Of course not. Mummy, when am I going to get breasts? - Next Tuesday. Why? - I don't know. Sometimes I think they look silly. Well, they do look best with formal wear. What would Daddy like? I think he'd like anything you'd get him. I want to get him something special. How about a tie? A tie's nice, but Daddy has ties. Daddy has most of the things we've seen. I want to get him something that he doesn't have. Well, get him a dress. Just get him something you like. Daddy will love that because it's from you. Not because it's blue or red, but because it's from you. Mummy, do you know any Germans? - Not too many. - What are they like? I don't really know. Probably very much like us. Do you think there are German children buying Christmas presents... - for their fathers right now? - Yes, I suppose so. Handkerchiefs. Let's get Daddy handkerchiefs. I can never get over the way it looks like the propellers are spinning backwards. Backwards? The propellers are spinning backwards? - Forget it. - Forget it? The goddamn propellers are spinning backwards. I'm supposed to forget it? It's an optical illusion. I was simply saying... Forget it. Optical illusion, my ass. How do you know forward from backwards with a propeller? When we take off for France, if we land in New York, the propellers are spinning backwards. I hope they're spinning backwards. Tower, this is Leader. Over. - Leader, this is Tower. Over. - Starting to taxi. Over. Roger, Leader. Over. Just my luck. They're spinning forward. Want me to take it up for you? No. - Listen to number one. - Why, what's wrong? I don't know. Something doesn't sound right. Leader, this is Tower. Over. Just one second, Tower. Over. - Check the RPMs. - RPMs normal. - Oil pressure? - Leader, this is Tower. Over. Lucas, are you hearing number one? Something doesn't sound right. Can't tell from here, sir. Did you check the gauges? - The gauges are okay. - I can't tell from here. I hear something wrong. I hear everything wrong. Something's not right. The gauges don't always show it. Leader, this is Tower. Please answer. Over. Tower, this is Leader. Over. Begin your take-off. I got a problem with my number one. I'm coming back. Over. Repeat that please, Leader. I got a problem with my number one. Over. I'm coming back. Roger, Leader. You are returning to base. Patman, you're the new leader. Over. Roger, Tower. Over. Price, you become Patman's number two. Patterson, please follow Price. Patman, you are clear for take-off. Over. Roger, Tower. Clear for take-off. Now listen, you creature, it's very late. If you want Christmas morning to come, you'll have to go to sleep now. - But I can't sleep. - I know that, but you have to. Father Christmas will not bring you anything until you're asleep. - Why? - It's the rules. - I just want to say hello to him. - He's busy. Will the Germans shoot him while he's flying? No, no, of course not. I don't care what I get. Well, I mean, anything will make me happy. Of course. There's nothing in particular that you want. Oh, no, nothing in particular. Anything will make me happy. It would be nice, though, if I had a little friend of my own to play with. I'll have another baby. You know what I mean. Not a real person, just a... Well, you know. I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Now, good night, old friend. Dream the sweetest dreams. Tomorrow is Christmas. If you don't go to sleep now, I'll strangle you. Well, young lady, if you're not tired, I am. Wait till you see what I got you. If it's from you, I'll love it. Good night. Good night. I'm sound asleep. Did you put her present out for tomorrow? Yes. It's right in the Middle of the living room. Her glazed little eyes staring at the window. What is it she wants with another doll? God knows. I've never seen a child want anything more than she wants that doll. Sarah's hands are so small. I don't know, during the day when she's rushing around like a maniac... she doesn't seem so small. But when she's in her bed and she's sleepy... I think she shrinks. I know what you mean. It's so strange. It's Christmas Eve, and we're fighting a war. Fighting wars never seemed to make much sense. Just seems it makes less sense on Christmas Eve. I wonder what the other Side is thinking right now. Good night, darling. Good night. I love you. I love you. [CHATTANOOGA CHOO-CHOO] Harriet, you haven a beautiful throat. Do you know that? - My name is Phyllis. - Of course it is. You have a beautiful throat too. - Do you want to dance? - Susan, my darling... ordinarily that would be a wonderful suggestion. Under certain conditions, I am your actual Fred Astaire. However, since the injury... What injury? I don't like to talk about it. I didn't know you were wounded. Just a little shrapnel in the leg. How come they didn't send you Home if you were wounded? They wanted to. I wouldn't go. Nothing will keep me from flying. Oh, Lieutenant, that's really very, very... Paula, my sweet... Paula, it's really nothing to make a fuss about. Sometimes the pain... What's life without pain, I always say. How about another little drinky, huh? Hey, Cimino. Hyer. Hello, Hyer. Listen, listen, you got to help me. - Have you met Barbara? - Phyllis. Have you ever seen such a throat? Listen, Jerry. I got this one all primed. Except she won't leave her friend alone. Hyer, you know, I've always harboured a suspicion that blue eyes don't see so good. Too much inbreeding. Have you... Have you taken a good look at Dorothy? What am I gonna do? How about Halloran? Give one to Halloran. - I don't think so. - Come on. It's a terrific idea. Come on, Rita. We're gonna all go over and be with Halloran. Hey, I thought you had an injured leg. My God, I can walk again. Ladies, this is our leader. Leader, these are our ladies. This is Elizabeth. Elizabeth, meet Halloran. Hello. - This is Audrey. - Phyllis. - Where are you from? - Illinois. The decorations are very pretty, aren't they? Yes. Let's go somewhere we can be alone. I want to stay here. It's Christmas, and I am Your actual serviceman alone overseas. I want to stay here. Marion, perhaps you are a spy. - Hey, are you all right? - Yeah. Let me put it another way. Let's fool around. - Okay. - There is a god. They're back. Where's Patman? He'll be here in a minute. Don't worry. - Who's Patman? - Patman, my luscious Linda... is the brave soul who flew lead instead of us this fine day... because of a port engine with the holiday spirit. He'll be here in a minute. - Hey, Beef. - Oh, Halloran. How you doing? - How did it go today? - Not so good. We lost three. Yeah, you are one lucky son of a bitch, let me tell you. Where's Patman? - One lucky son of a bitch. - Where's Patman? I never saw an aeroplane break up into so many little pieces. - Where's Patman? - He took a direct hit. It must have been right in the bomb bay with a full load. - Maybe he bailed out. - Not a chance. I never saw so many little pieces. Hey, where's that Cimino, huh? I wanna tell him. If it hadn't been for that engine of yours, it would have been you instead of Patman. I wanna tell Cimino to go kiss that engine of yours. Hey, what's the matter? You heard it, didn't you? The port engine, something was wrong. Sure. Come on. Sit down. You heard something wrong, didn't you? Every time an engine starts up, I hear something wrong. It was something. It was. Ladies, let's all play follow-the-leader. Come on, Francine. - You found it, didn't you? - Lieutenant? You found it, goddamn you. You found it, right? I don't know yet. - Tell me you found it, you jerk. - Take it easy. - He heard it. - Take it easy. Excuse me, Flo. Don't go away. - Hi, guys. - I heard it. I heard it. Come on. I heard it. I heard it, believe me. Patman, I heard it. - I thought we were gonna play. - No, we're not gonna play. Believe me, Patman. I heard it, Patman. Goddamn you. Goddamn you, Patman. Keller. Helmut Keller. Essen. 1908. Major. Ruth. Carl. Please, don't smoke. Lieutenant Wells... English is a language you do not understand. You have never spoken a word of it in your life. They didn't teach you English in Essen. You must never speak in English or respond to English, even around here. No matter who is talking to you, if it is in English. You do not understand. I don't care if it's the P.M. himself who's talking to you. One slip like that, and you're quite dead. All right, lesson over. It's time we took a break. Don't be discouraged. You're doing fine. Just fine. Come on. I'll pay for the tea. Come on. It's all right. Lieutenant Wells, class is over for the afternoon. [IN GERMAN] Sometimes when we're together... I feel so close that I don't know where I end and you begin. I never knew it could be like that. I was 19 when I got married. He was the only man I'd ever known. I never felt I lacked anything, it's just that I wasn't sure if this was it. If this was everything. Maybe that's why I went with you that first day at the bus stop. It's so damned unfair. I try so hard to forget you. I really do. I wind up spending more of my Time trying to forget you, which is the same as thinking of you all the time. I don't want to hurt anybody. I don't want to do anything wrong. Sometimes I sit across the dinner table from him, and I watch him. And I want him so Desperately to do something... or say something or be something that I can hate. But he never does. I've hurt him so much. It makes me hate myself. I wish I'd never met you. But then when I'm with you... and it's so strong, and I don't ever want to let you go. Why don't things work out the way they're supposed to? I don't know how things are supposed to work out. And I don't know any more what I heard in that engine. A couple of months ago, the whole propeller could have fallen off... and I wouldn't have gone back. It's so damn easy to be brave when you haven't got anything to lose. I'm scared now. I don't want to die and not see you any more. Nothing makes any sense until I'm with you, and then everything makes sense. I don't wanna let you go. I just wanna be with you all the time. I don't want to wake up in the morning and not know if I'm going to see you ever. I'm tired of missing you, and I don't even know your last name. I'm all in pieces. I want you to put me back together. Hold me now and make everything outside go away. On the way in to see you... I was trying to think of a way... to tell you that we shouldn't see each other any more. I did the same thing. Now, here you have your two main types... your combination lock and your key lock. Now, with your combination lock, which works on what we call a series of tumblers... first you have to find out whether it's a three or a four-number combination. And then whether you first move to the right or the left. If it's your key lock, it's just the matter of finding a proper key. In the absence of a key, a problem which has confronted many folks, there are certain very delicate instruments that do a right proper job. And then, why it's just a matter of learning how to use them. How long will it take to learn to open one? Well, I... You got to understand that, opening these things is not something any old bloke can do, you know. It's what you might call a gift, even if I do say so myself. Well, let's say that Lieutenant Wells is gifted. Well, if it's a key lock, a couple of days. If it's a combination lock, I'd say about six months. Well, the safe we're interested in is a Kohner 3-3-5. - That's a Gerry safe. - Yes, Harry. You may have noticed we're at war with the Germans. You've got a point there. - Which is it? - Well, you're in luck. It's a key lock. Any school kid could crack it. As a matter of fact, I cracked one almost like it when I was a school kid. Right. Now, gentlemen, here you have before your eyes your lock pick. And you have here your safe, which is almost the same as your Kohner 3-3-5. Now, you insert your lock pick into your Kohner 3-3-5. Feeling your way through the elements. For your personal information, there happen to be four. One. Two. Three. Four. Apple pie. Bleeding apple pie. Hey, nice to see you, Lieutenant. - Nice to see you, sir. - Why don't you sit down? I have a little problem. It's a mission. A special mission. The group sent down word that they needed a volunteer. Now, it is considered a bit risky, so they wanted to put it on a voluntary basis. It's for tomorrow night. Oh, about the other day. I checked with the mechanic. It's strange. He couldn't find a thing wrong with that port engine. Now, if you felt there was something wrong, well, I'm sure there was. If you heard it... Look, a mechanic's not a pilot, right? I don't listen to any kind of rumour. Never. Sure there's been a lot of talk around. You know what a base is like. You can't pay any attention to that kind of talk. Look, I don't believe for a moment... that you made the whole thing up about that engine. Not a word. Just gossip. Now where was I? Oh, yeah. That mission tomorrow night. Now, I knew that you'd want to volunteer to do it. It's not that you've got anything to prove. I just felt that you'd like to go for it. Now, I told Operations... to have those engines double checked. So, I'm quite sure you won't be disappointed and have to cancel that flight. Is he ready? I think he's as ready as he ever will be. What do you mean by that? I can't be too specific. There's nothing wrong with Wells, he does everything the way he's supposed to. I'd simply prefer him to be a bit more spontaneous. Spontaneous? Well, once you teach him something he learns it. However, I'm not totally sure how he will react... if something occurs that he isn't prepared for. Well, then, let's hope you prepare him for everything. Well, that would be nice. New stuff, this? It's supposed to be a cooler smoke. We're not going to send Wells on a regular flight. Afraid we have to be a bit paranoid about the leak in Intelligence. We're going to drop him in a totally different way. If this stuff is supposed to be cool, I'd hate to think what they call hot. No, we're not going to use Intelligence for the flight. Chaps don't even know about it. We're not even going to use a transport aircraft. As a matter of fact, we're not even going to use a British aircraft. I say, Sellinger, would you mind coming with me across the street? There's a tobacconist over there. - Hello, how are you feeling? - Fine, thank you. - Hello, handsome. - Hello, what's it today, then? I do hope you like potatoes. Your dinner is served, milord. I think I'll take it in the study, thank you. Very good, milord. There's a phone call for you, Margaret. Where? - The nurses' station. - Thank you. - Hello? - Hello? Hello? I can't hear you, it's madness here. Is that you, Paul? Yes. Yes. Can you hear me now? It's better, but you'll have to speak up. Is this all right? It's fine. Is anything the matter? No, no nothing. I had no special reason for calling. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I just wanted to hear your voice, that's all. Don't be silly, you haven't disturbed me. I'm glad to hear your voice too. - I love you, Margaret. - I love you too. - I know I'm not that special. - What are you talking about? Of course you're special. Oh, no, I'm not, and we both know it. It's just my curse to be so damned ordinary. Paul? I do so want... I do so want to be dashing. It's not that I don't want to be, but I can't blame you for finding me unexciting. Paul, I don't know why you're talking like this. You're very special, and very dashing. Mrs Sellinger, ward four, please. I didn't mean to disturb you. Paul, I'm so glad you called, but... Mrs Sellinger, ward four. Paul, I'm sorry, I have to go now, they're calling me. I understand, darling, I'll talk to you later. - I love you. - Paul? Yes, Captain Sellinger? Will you get me Lieutenant Wells on the line, please? - Hey, it's dark out. - No kidding? No, really, I wouldn't fool you. Why are we the only plane taking off? Because we got a special mission. Lucky us. You know, when it's dark out, you can bump into things. I'll be real careful. Hey, Cimino, where are the bombs? There's no bombs on board. We're a bomber, we're supposed to drop bombs. - Where are the bombs? - No bombs. I like that. You know, bombs are dangerous on account of the fact they can blow up. Both of you shut up, will you? We're waiting for an English guy named Wells. We're going to drop him instead of bombs. I like that. Dropping a person instead of a bomb on account of the fact... that people don't blow up the way bombs do. - Starting port engines. - Starting port engines. How do they sound, sir? They sound fine, Giler. Even if they don't sound fine, they sound fine. Wonder where the hell that English guy is. It's dark out. Maybe he's not so stupid. Is this Wells? No, there's been a change of some kind. - Are you Captain Sellinger? - Captain, Lieutenant Halloran. - Hello? - Mummy, Mummy. Hello, darling. Oh, your hair smells nice. Mrs Clarin washed it for me and got soap in my eyes. Did you cry? Wouldn't you cry if Mrs Clarin got soap in your eyes? Yes, I think I would. Where's Daddy? He came home early, then went out again. Mrs Clarin gave me dinner and was just putting me to sleep when you came home. - Did he say where he was going? - He left a note on the pillow. I think that's romantic. What does Daddy say? Is it mushy? Daddy has to go away on a little trip. When will he be back? - Soon... very soon. - Will he bring me something? Your coat's all wet. I did a painting Of Tyrannosaurus Rex in orange. Have you ever seen an orange Tyrannosaurus Rex? Come, Mummy, look at it. Mummy, come on. Listen, I don't mean to be pushy, but you know that Englishman we got on board? He isn't an Englishman, he's your actual Kraut. You can tell by the Little lightning bolts on his collar. Oh, I forgot to tell you. We decided the Germans can't lose. We're going to be on their side now. Oh, good. I like the uniforms. - Captain Sellinger, you okay? - Quite well, thank you. We're over the French coast, we'll try and avoid any German position. I'm beginning to think this isn't such a crazy mission. When the times comes, we'll remove The belly hatch where you'll drop through. Remember to keep your arms tight to your body until you're clear of the props. I shall remember, thank you. Oh, Jesus Christ. How bad is it? How bad is it? No. It's a mistake. You're not supposed to die. Please, stop it. It's all a mistake. Lieutenant Halloran? Are you all right? We're hit up here, bad. I don't know if I can keep it flying. I'm afraid we've been hit back here. How bad? Rather bad, I think they're both dead. Lucas? Giler? Cimino? Cimino. Oh, Cimino. Don't do this. Please don't. My God. He has no face. The two men back there, they're dead. He has no face. Keep your hands tight. Don't pull the ring till you're clear. It's like somebody took a vacuum Cleaner and straightened out the mess. They're all gone. It's not right. Should've left a mark. I'm really sorry. I know how you feel. I'm so sorry I caused all this. It's not your fault. Do you know where we are? About 20 miles south of Lyons. Well, that's where I have to go. I got to make my way to the channel. It's the other direction. - Good luck. - Thank you. And thank you for everything. I beg your pardon, Lieutenant. Lyons is north of here, you say? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I hate to impose on you, but, you happen to know which way is north? - Yeah, that way. - Thank you again. Oh. Damn. I say, Lieutenant Halloran, I'm really sorry to be such a burden to you. I wonder if you wouldn't mind giving me a hand? It's probably sprained. It's not broken, it's going to be sore for awhile. You mind if I ask you a question? No, not at all. I was wondering, seeing as how you don't know north from south, and you can't take ten steps without falling on your ass... I was wondering, have you ever done anything like this before? Well, now that you mention it, no. Wonderful. Well, you look real spiffy in the uniform. I don't want to go with you, you know. Not one bit. You don't know what the hell you're doing. And I certainly don't know what the hell I'm doing. But here I am, as we speak, going with you. We're going to get our asses shot off. Well, I'm really grateful to you. I really am. That's just swell. - Hello? - This is Mrs Sellinger? - This is Major Trumbo. - Oh, my God, it's Paul. Is he all right? The plane he was on was shot down. I have no more information than that at this time. However, it's quite possible that he bailed out and he's absolutely fine. I just don't know right now. Mrs Sellinger, are you there? Yes. As soon as I learn anything more, I will be sure to call you. Your husband's a good man, intelligent. I'm certain he's all right. I just can't understand why he went in place of Wells. Can't understand it at all. Not like him to be so impulsive. I'll call you as soon as I learn anything. I'm sure he's fine. Mrs Sellinger, are you there? Thank you. Thank you for calling. Mummy, is everything all right? How far do you think we've gone? How am I supposed to know? You're the goddamn spy, not me. Don't you guys have a magic manual or something... - that teaches you all that stuff? - Oh, yes, yes, we do. - Didn't you ever read it? - I helped write it. Well, what does it say about measuring distances? I forget. Jesus, we're going to get our asses shot off. [TALKING IN GERMAN] [CHATTERING IN GERMAN] Oh, no. [TALKING IN FRENCH] [CONTINUES IN FRENCH] You think you could give me a hand here? She's going to kill me, she thinks I'm German. I wonder why she thinks you're German. Betty Grable, Hershey bars, Yankee Stadium? Hello, Joe. She said she had a brother who was killed by the Germans. Her father refused to do anything about it. He's a collaborator... out of fear more than anything else I should suppose. She says she's doing what he should be doing. [TALKING IN FRENCH] It's his car, she says we can take it. [THANKS HER IN FRENCH] This is... This is going to work out rather well. I'm thrilled. As an SS officer, I'm entitled to an aide. You're wearing the uniform of a Sergeant. You won't look at all out of place. Where won't it look out of place? At Gestapo Headquarters in Lyons. Listen, you've got a perfect Right to get yourself killed... and I've got a right to stay alive. I fully appreciate the position I've placed you in, Lieutenant, but I just don't think I can do this thing alone because my leg is hurt... and this thing has got to be done. It's that important. I don't speak German, in case you didn't notice. How am I going to fool anybody if I don't speak German? Well, If you don't speak to anyone, then no one will know you don't speak German. - That makes sense, doesn't it? - Shit. Better get rid of those cigarettes. What? And the lighter. They're American. - Mind if I ask you something? - No, not at all. Why did you decide to go instead of that guy, Wells? Ah, that's rather complicated. I don't know how to answer that. Try. All my life, no matter what I did... I've always been the same thing... pleasant. I'm pleasant. I was a teacher, that's a pleasant profession. I'm rather pleasant looking, if I do say so myself. If anyone were asked to describe me, they'd say I was... pleasant. Oh, I've never minded it that much before. Except now, it's beginning to hurt. More than I ever thought anything could hurt. - I don't know what you mean. - Well, take a look at yourself. - I can't, I'm driving. - I'm serious. Take a good look at yourself, and you'll see a hero. I'm not a hero, and I don't want to be one. Even if you don't want to be one, you are. You can't help it. You're the one who is ice-skating on the lake... when the little boy falls into the freezing water, and you save him. I'm the one who gives you my coat to wrap him in. And when it's all over, you're on the front page of all the newspapers, saying it was really nothing... and I have a wet coat. Are you kidding? You're supposed to open the door for me. They changed it. They put in a new safe. It's a combination safe. I haven't the foggiest notion how to open it. I love it. Why, Mrs Sellinger, what a pleasant surprise. I am sorry to barge in on you like this, Major Trumbo. It's just that I haven't heard anything since we spoke last night, and I've been beside myself. I was hoping that you'd learnt something new. Won't you sit down? Would you like a glass of sherry? - No, thank you. - Cigarette? Major, what the hell happened? We don't know. The plane is missing. Not a word, not a trace, nothing. I still can't understand why Paul acted so impulsively. - I can. - Really? Why? It's not something I can explain. Well, Mrs Sellinger, I do assure you I will contact you... the moment I hear anything. I've spoken to the American Colonel Bart, I think his name is, and they're waiting for some word themselves. Who's Colonel Bart? Paul was in an American plane from the Eighth Air Force. This man, Bart, is the wing commander. Where's he located? At Windsor Field. Thank you very much, Major. I do apologise for pestering you so. Mrs Sellinger, seeing Colonel Bart won't accomplish anything. He knows no more than I do. I'm sure you're right. Thank you again. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] Cigarette? [WHISPERING IN GERMAN] [CONTINUES IN GERMAN] [WHISPERING IN GERMAN] [CHATTERING IN GERMAN] Are you out of your goddamned mind? Achtung. [SHOUTING IN GERMAN] - Mrs Sellinger? - Yes. I'm Colonel Bart. Major Trumbo told me you'd be coming around. It's nice of you to take time to speak with me. - Not at all. Please sit down. - Thank you. You must think I'm an awful pest. It's just that I have to know for myself what's happened. Well, yes, of course. We received no notification of survivors. Can't send reconnaissance aircraft in to check... for fear of drawing attention to the mission. - You understand? - No, I don't. Yeah, well... there's every chance they managed to bail out. - But you don't know for sure? - No. No, I don't. Except I do know that if they did bail out... your husband is in very good hands. The pilot, Lieutenant Halloran, is a very determined, very resourceful man. Apple pie? [IN FRENCH] Well, we did it. We actually did it. Look, I don't want to cramp your style or anything... but we're still not out of France yet. We'll get out all right. It'd be silly for us to come this far and not get out. Ruin my whole day. [IN FRENCH] I can go back now. I can be more for her to see. She must be very special. - She is very special. Have you ever felt that way about any woman? Yeah. I do now. Except with me it's different. Ever since I met her... I don't know who I am any more. Well, I know who you are. You're a good and brave man. I don't feel very brave. That's absurd. Look what you've done. I didn't do anything except try and stay alive. Whatever I did, I did because I was too scared to die. The only men who are brave are the frightened men. Men who aren't frightened aren't brave, they're insane. You're only brave when there's something to lose. And you still try. When we get back, go to her, hold her... and never let go. That's what I'm going to do when I see Margaret. Tell me more about your wife. What's her name? Margaret. God, I love that name, don't you? Yeah. How do I tell you about her? Well, if there is really such a thing as one woman for you... it's Margaret for me. I know that sounds like something out of Mother Goose... but it's true. We have a daughter, Sarah. She looks like her mother, which is reason enough to think she's beautiful. Here, this is Margaret. - She's lovely, isn't she? - Yeah. [BOTH SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [CONTINUES IN FRENCH] Well, that's marvellous. She says there's a bridge... about eight kilometres from here to the left. There's a resistance group waiting for us. Merci. Come on, old man. Eat something. - Here's your watch. - Oh, thanks. Son of a bitch. That girl's fink Father must have called the Germans. [SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [MEN SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [CHATTERING IN GERMAN] Perfect. Will you come on. I think I left my kidneys back there. You've still got your ass. - Grab on. - I can't, go back. I'm too scared to argue with you. Grab on, goddamn it. You're going to get us both killed. When you get back to London, please look up my wife. Her name is Margaret. Please, tell her her husband died a brave man. Tell her... yourself. Well, I... get the wet coat again. No, pal. This time you get the girl. No. Oh, no. No, you don't, not now. If you die on me, I'll kill you. Do you want to play cards? I feel like demolishing you. You're trying to be cheerful because you're worried about Daddy. He's going to be all right. I love you more than it's possible to love anyone, you know? Hello? Yes? Mummy, is it good crying or bad crying? I knew it. Captain Sellinger, which room is he in please? I'm his wife. 4-4-2, Mrs Sellinger. Just down the corridor. Hello, old friend. It's so unfair for anybody's eyes to be that colour. Halloran... I... Me too. Are you all right? Are you hurt? I was lost for awhile, but I think I'm back now. I just wish your eyes weren't that colour. There's a man in a room down there. A good man. I wish he wasn't. When I first heard that you'd been shot down together... I felt I was being punished. Then after awhile... I knew that you would take care of him, that you would come back. I love you enough to let you go, which is more than I've ever loved anything or anybody in my life. I wish I didn't cry all the damn time. I will never care for anyone the way I care for you. And do things have to work out this way? Things work out the way they're supposed to. Listen, you got to go to him, and I got to turn and walk away. That's what we have to do. You know that and I know that. I'm entirely capable of messing this whole thing up, so you got to help me. - I love you, Halloran. - I love you, Maggie. Think of me when you drink tea.
