Dad, how much longer? Just a couple of hours, little one, then we're here. I'm bored. Hopefully we will be there soon. Listen now ... We are still across the Atlantic ocean. Then you can easily calculate how long it takes before we land. Have a look Look out the window and see what animals you can see among the clouds, or something like that. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our tespasses ... ... which is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our tespasses. Chill a while, sister. You shouldn't worry. Were in God's hands. Oh father, I'm such a nervous flyer. Have faith, sister. I suppose they told the story of when I became a priest? or how I became a priest? Oh well ... I've heard it was a miraculous conversion. That you were such a awful L.A. gang members You had let Satan into your soul. More than that, sister. Satan had parked his car just outside the house of my soul. He busted the locks and was squatting his slimy self in there. He was taking a dump in my toilet and kicking back on my couch. Dialing himself a pizza with the intention on staying for good. - Satan eats pizza? - It's a metaphor. There I was ... Locked up in my cell at Pelican Bay. In satan's grasp. And Jesus came to me in a bright light and told me to become His warrior. Now I am fighting for Jesus! Amen, fader! Amen! And that's the winning team. We're going to whip Satans ass. -Father, really mind your words. -I apologize for the cussing. But we will whip his ass on that Judgement Day. Hay! Can I get me a refills here? Bada Bing, Bada Bing! Is the frickin bar devil closed, or? Yes Sir. Ohh Jeezz ... I was hoping for the loveley lady who brought me dinner. You know with experience ... Just the way I like it. Stewardess uniform. Well Sir, we all have uniforms. Yeees, but hers fit just right, just the way I like it. You know what I mean? Guess not. Hehe oh boy. What can I get you Sir? Well if you could get Tinkerbell to give me a refill, before he flitters his way back up the top of that Christmas tree? Okay. One more. And then maybe we should think about getting some sleep? Well yes, blankets, some pillows and ... -I've heard it all before Sir. -We can ...? -If I...? -I've heard that before too. Now you drink your drink and be a nice quiet little frequent flier, or I'll have to spank your bottom and and throw you outside and play with the naughty boys. And it's minus thirty out there today. Ok? Yes, she likes me. There's something on the radar. Dad, I saw a shark between the clouds. -That's great! -No, a real shark. There! How is that possible, boy? How can a shark fly? It is a sea animal. Wait. Several readings. Breach! Holy shit! Look into the light, spawn of Satan! We interrupt our program for an important message. News just came in that flight NHL 234 crashed on its way from Vancouver to Frankfurt, near Iceland. We currently have no further information, but air traffic controllers emphasise that a terrorist attack can not be ruled out. This was Jason Konrad live from the AT&amp;T House in Tribeca, Manhattan. Your voice at night. Age: 115. Injection unit 4 ml currently adapted K7B, based on analysis from 05.05.2017. The structuring of the existing DNA sequence is now reconciled with cell decay. The substance ia absorbed for another two months. Physical condition age 75. Dna matched. Access granted. Welcome, Angelique Richter, welcome. Seen this? ... images recorded from passenger seat 270. Yeah, it's bad. Could be a whole bunch of things. Pilot error, terrorists ... But this is why the civil aviation authority will take care of it and not our division. Recording for Case 234. Present Captain Brent Tyler and Dr. Rachel Milner. We took the lead 36 hours ago. The plane crash occured according to a previous investigation, between Greenland and Iceland. Flight NHL 234 was on it's way from Vancouver to Frankfurt with a stopover in Iceland. The doc... The documents revealed, that 157 passengers and seven crew were on board. Flight NHL 234 disappeared 19:02 from the radar. The Immediate "innitiated search of the Icelandic authorities was inconclusive. Eight bodies have been found so far. Once we know more I will report back. Do you think this and our attack are linked Now I know. You send her to the Arctic? She will be pissed. She hates the cold. Let's just hope your sister gets there in time. Just a few kilometers from here. Our research team is already at the site. Currently scaning the object. We been busy tracking the retreat of the glacier, Since the effects of global warming greatly accelerated the thawing process. Right now, I still wish it would get warmer. Look at the size of that! This craft looks like some kind of warship. I have never seen a design like this. Me neither. That's why I called in Richter. That's why we sent an advanced party to check it out. -You don't know what the hell is in there. -This is our finest team. Highly motivated. Their dedication is faultless. I think they can handle this. You'll see more details of the helmet camera. It's a live feed. That's ah... Maynard's camera. Fuck! We have to get out of there. Get help. Get help! Live feed from the Arctic. Connected to: Diabla Richter. Dr. Richter! We need help! Send help now! This... They have captured oen of the scientists. It's her camera signal were watching. No! It's too late, you can't save her. Just get the hell out of there! Maybe she's alive. Oh my God... - Did you see all that? -Yes. My past is finally catching up with me. But you have to get out of there now! I'll try. Why does she never listen to me ?! -What's happening Sir? -It's worse than I feard. A nation built on a foundation of freedom. There is no country in the world that is stronger, more powerful and greater than the United States of America. We bring prosperity and peace. Richter Technology shakes hands with the weak.

Dad, I've never seen anything like this before. Did you forget to tell us that you may know something? Don't tell me... Come on. The devil must rest. How did I get here? Our rescue team saved your life. Age: 115 Injection unit 4 ml currently adapted K7B based on analysis from 05.05.2017. The structuring of the existing DNA sequence is now reconciled with cell decay. Please, have a seat. Thanks. Takahashi-sushi. Mom's favorite food. From the East Village. Let's talk about something else. Yes. Let's talk about your past, Dad. That's all. Thanks. Project Himmelsfaust was the brainchild of the brilliant Nazi scientist Dr Hans Kammler. Pioneer in genetic mutation surgery. By 1944, the Nazis were in desperate for effective superweapons, and Kammler thought he had them in spades. - Is it okay now, Martha? -Yes, Major General. Now. Highly honored ... ... SS leader Heinrich Himmler. As a party member, I have ... ... the following sincere statement ... ... about the special construction project S3 ... ... to present. I want my soldiers to advance. I want this place, as far as possible ... Our engineers have already implemented ... ... their first successful antigravity tests. "Antigravitations tests" or "test"? Test. We have to start over because we have forgotten the secret project Glocke. SWING DANCE PROHIBITED Dr. Kammler. Your visitor is here. He has to wait a bit until our construction application is complete. Mr. Marshal ... I must ask you to be a little patient. Mr Kammler will have time soon. This is offensive! Hermann? My dear Kammler! You have to help me! -Good evening, dear Hermann. Brandy? -A double! Listen now, dear Kammler. My entire aviation division has been wiped out by these British pretend pilots in a cowardly and shameful ambush! Now I'm standing here like a total idiot, not knowing where his going. Say you have a solution to my problem. For the final victory. My research team has been working on a dynamic aviation program for a long time , with a genetically engineered serum called K7B. I know this I have known this for a long time! What can this K7C do? K7B, Hermann. -Hermann, the bowl. -Nonsense! Think, dear Hermann, that this project, which I now intend to show you, can turn the tide of war. That would enable the Reich to recapture dominion over the sky. That was a bold statement, Kammler! I'm all ears. Impress me. I present: Project Himmelsfaust. SECRET DOCUMENTS This is an appeal to the German people. Everyone must clearly understand their task. Every countryman knows the serious situation of our beloved Reich. Millions of faithful comrades have died the heroic death of our fatherland, in the necessary fight against the enemy. We have so far been able to counter the enemy's superior strength only courage, honor and determination. But there is hope. Thanks to German engineering and Dr. Hans Kammler's genius it has been possible to develop the retaliatory weapon K7B. Under the leadership of Dr. Klaus Richter , the weapon is now ready to resist the enemy. In men, the serum has a regenerating effect and builds up tissue and makes our brave soldiers indestructible. The not yet completely completed research indicates that K7B can prolong the life of a healthy person. In this way, the millennial Reich can be under his rule forever. In women, the weapon affects the cell structure and causes zombification. The external changes and aggressive behavior may seem unpleasant, but Dr. Kammler sees the desired positive effects throughout. Women become stronger, more enduring and more decisive. This allows our country's women to fill the ranks at the front. K7B, produced in our laboratories, has finally undergone the test phase and is now ready to begin its triumphant march. Across the eastern battlefields, Africa's arid deserts and rebellious nations will soon wave the flag of victory. K7B will finally turn the blade of fate in our favor. Through tactical air operations to disperse the gas our dead soldiers will become millions of undead super soldiers. Like Phoenix from the ashes, they will rise from the battlefields where they fell, reborn to serve our German homeland. Through K7B, the dead heroes of our nation become the protectors of a new age. Carried by the cries of patriotism , they guarantee the final victory. Indestructible and tireless, division after division will rise to march in line to the weapons factories. Each of them will man their aircraft - the Reich air sharks! These wonders of engineering together with the super soldiers constitute the ultimate weapon of retaliation. Equipped with jet engines, machine guns and the shark's aeronautical concept they rise to the skies, united by their unwavering will to victory. It is the commandment of the moment. Get up, soldier! Attack and break free! Victory! Prepare a presentation to the Führer! I guarantee he will be happy. Many thanks, Kammler. I'm in debt to you. Maybe we should hunt together sometime. I have just had a delightful little hunting lodge built in Braunschweig. If my research allows it , I will gladly consider it. -Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. Himmelsfaust was the central facility. It belonged to the SS Parachute Battalion 500. Thus it was directly supervised by Göring himself. That was what was crux of the matter. After the Stalingrad fiasco and the following months Göring realized that their thousand year Reich would not even turn ten years old. But he saw the potential with Kammler's idea. So we got everything we wanted and took our chances. The Horten brothers built the engines, Henkel took care of the steering column construction and the doctor and I synthesized K7B. How could you?! You have played god. No, we did not play god. We were gods. How do you think I got this position? And who do you think you worked on for the last twenty years? Let me summarize: Once these predators are in the air, nothing and no one is safe. And they can become invisible. That's a disaster! So that was what's in those water tanks at Himmelsfaust. Genetically mutated flying Nazi sharks? Sky sharks are much more than genetically manipulated animals. They're perfect weapon systems. They're lurking in the clouds, watching and preying mercilessly. There's twenty hunting sharks of model RFH 3. We could not produce more, but believe me, twenty are enough to destroy whole cities. After the fierce attack on the Reichs capital on 21-22 November I declared in Berlin that the time had come for retaliation against the British. The British press hit me hard the next day with the mocking question of whether the new weapon I announced had arisen at the Ministry of Propaganda instead of the Ministry of Armaments. Secure it! Do you not comprehend the situation? My God, the Russians will be here soon. We have to fight! We won't not do that. We'll take K7B. And then we take the next last seats to Argentina. It's treason! Look around, Klaus. This is the past. Himmelsfaust is over. The experiment failed. - We're not going to run away. I do not allow it! -Klaus! I never agree to run away! I will not accept it! For the German fatherland! But you came to the West after the war and worked for the military here. How is that possible? -I owe it to Paperclip. -Paperclip? - You were you one of the Paperclip boys? - What is Paperclip? Project Paperclip originated from Operation Overcast. They tried to aquire the best scientits of the German army rearch institure behind the backs of our allies. Jet operation and rocket engineering. Stealth technology. We found ourselves in the world's biggest toy store, and under no circumstances did our foces wanted to share it with Russians. So we signed conspicuous Nazi scientists and made them our Paperclip boys. Overnight, Wernher von Braun became the America's greatest rocket scientist without anyone ever asking about his past. I told them all I knew. They found it hard to believe at first. The scope of the Himmelsfaust project. I told them I'd lead them to Kammler. and they would get all the evidence they needed. I had had enough of Kammler's special brand of madness. He was going to drag us all down with him. I signed up to build a stronger Germany, not destroy it. I really want to start all over. But you have to trust me! -Give us a reason why we should. -Because only I can save the world. But more than a thousand of us came to the US. And you changed sides, just like that? All is fair in love and war. And then you just stopped, started a family and played a Mr nice guy. How can we trust you again, after you have lied to us all those years? Hello this is Natalie Rochefort from MTP News. We have word of several terrorist attacks taking place throughout Europe. It seems that London is under attacked. Several ... Sky Sharks! Oh my God! They tearing people apart! Here is Clara from the Lubb direct for you from the Reichstag. What is it...? Did you get it, Matze? They will not believe it ... Matze? Did you get it. It is... What have you done? - How much time do we have? - A week max. We'll call a NSC war council meeting. Time to strike back. Security level 7. Authorisation granted. Angelique, I need you to get me the head of German intelligence. And see if you can reach our French friend Colbert. And we need the Japanese shark expert Dr. Katsube. But we can 't do without that weird CIA guy Martin Keele. He may be in Venezuela, what do I know, but we need ... ... that fucking arrogant bastard from London, whatever his name is. And my friend Frost, of course. Sorry I'm a little late, gentlemen. And ladies. Hello, Klaus. How are things? - Not bad, Mitch. Not Bad. How's Marjorie? -Ohh fine. She still makes the worst cornbread ever. My research indicated that the Himmelsfaust project was destroyed. Program neutralised. But I was wrong. What I'm sad to say I helped create seventy years ago has been dormant. waiting for an opportunity to strike. There's no reason to cry over spilled milk, Dr. Richter. If you can now call 400 airline passengers chopped up like beef jerkey in the span of 24 hours "spilled milk". The reality is we must destroy these abominations, or no aircraft in the air is safe. Gentlemen, Dr Richter! These are sharks? But they can fly, you say? Yes, they have beeen frozen in the ice of the Arctic. Look, this is a clear and present threat, senator. We have an elite commando in the French Air Force. We will make them availabble, I will arrange it. Oh? We just happen to have one or two good pilots in the US Air Force too, my friend. Bah! Your "Top Guns". Our French elites, can fly better. -Oh really? -Don't forget. If you ever want to get into a pissing contest, any time, Colbert! I can send a coupe of my carriers down the river Seine and blow some wind up your skirt, my French fry. But if the Sky Sharks can re-establish the breeding program, no one knows how many could be uleashed. - What there are more of these things in the pipeline? -Do they have a breeding program ?! So how many of these things are there? What a squadron? a flock, What? It is inevitable. This is how the project was conceived. World domination. Sure did a great job thinking of this, Dr. Richter. Talk about ticking time bomb, it's lilke a God Damn Nazi reunion tour. "Ohh did you miss us in 1945? Guess what we're back!" Believe me, no one regrets this more than me. If they mutate, which they most likely will, they wont we as easy to hunt as regular sharks. Dr Katsube has studied the data. She thinks there could be a solution. Are they harder to hunt than other sharks? Yes, from the initial data, it seems that Sky Sharks have developed a form of genetic camouflage. - What ?! - He said you can't see the target ... ... doesn't matter how many missiles you have. -Their cloaking defense makes it difficult. -Exactly. More research! I feel we apoint a subcommittee to report on this information. By inverting the natural sonar-sensitive glands in the Sky Shark's skin they are able to deflect standard radar pulses. This means that the Sky Sharks' sonar impulses can be disturbed with an opposite sonar signal. This will render their invisibility cloak innefective. Do we have the equipment to do this? If we can get a military transport close enough with a device that emits a sonar pulse, then we have a chance. The UK must take a leading role in this action. Military intervention is not cheap. We have to consider the federal budget. The time for talk and bullshit is over! We will have to get the President and Congress to aprove this. We have to get all civilian traffic out of the sky. We need to create a no-fly zone. The sky martial law, is the only way to be safe. Make sure it is implemented. Dr. Richter, continue on a solution. Senator, Richter's team is ready. We have to strike fast. You have your orders. Get started with the work! Shoot the freaks with our sonar, and then our fighter jets can blow them apart. I want to see them drop to the ground, like hookers panties on Mardi Gras. What he saying is: Fuck the President and Congress. We just do it! I love living in a democracy. Hello this is Harold Everton here from the New York City News, with a special report. I'm in front of the New York's financial center right now. The world wide no-fly zone is a disaster. Our economy is in freefall financial collapse. And Wall Street has not opened today. Is this another Friday the 13th? Can the government really keep us in the country? It apears so. All flights are canceled nation wide, and nobody is leaving America. What's going on? Why are they holding us here? How long will this continue, and are we under martial law? The president needs to give us answers. Please God help us, and save our great country! I am Harold Everton from New York city. signing out, back to the studio. All flights are canceled. I repeat, all flights are canceled. Kai ... Please stop playing with the stupid ball, for god's sake! Where do the flying sharks come from? Who are the strange men on them? Hi, Tyler. We have the sonar impulse ready. Yes, we did it. You will receive a suitcase with the antidote. And you know what to do with it. Now the Eiffel Tower is also gone too. -I just want to get out of here, damn shit! -I'm quite with you. For five days I've been crouching here. Witnessing how Europe is turning into something ugly. The no-fly zone has to be lifted. Then off across the pond welcome back to the States. What happens if they attack us? I'm the best air marshal between Paris and New York. No flying fish stand between me and my passengers. I did not think I would go hunting sharks in an airplane. - You okay? - Yeah I'm fine. You sick or something?? We can have one of Tyler's paramedics to give you a shot. No! No, I'll be fine. It's just some stupid flu bug. If you say so. Let's go. I never thougth I would see you again, after the mess you left for me. You must be Angelique. - You...! - What? -Look! at this, our flight is clear. -What where? Where. You're right! When energy becomes a weapon. When the last remaining oil reserves rest in the hands of fanatics. If our idea of ​​freedom is threatened, we must act. War and terrorism must never again be tolerated again. Setting out your challenge. Fighting at the Dead Flesh Forces. Whoever occupies foreign countries nowadays no longer need to be ashamed. On today's battlefield, no one has to die. Your avatar, your willingness to train and our knowledge ensures the safety of your family. The Dead Flesh Forces, our sword of justice. We stand between good and evil. Where injustice becomes law , resistance becomes a duty. This is the final call for NY 7887. Boarding has begun at gate 84. I repeat, all passengers on flight NY 7887 from Nice to New York are requested to immediately go to gate 84. Okay. - Strange ... My office says tells me all Americans are allowed to fly out. -But I only see our small group. -I could not care less. The important thing is that I'm getting out. INVISIBILITY MODE Green light! Launch the attack on that Nazi character! This is your captain speaking. I'll have you there in a bit. Expect some turbulence. Switch your body cameras off. Ah Jasmine, I don't know why you are you bother? You look prety enough without that mess out there. -It's part of our job. -You'll learn. Excuse me, flight attendant. This stupid plane is going realy slowly. Can you tell that, that pilot of yours to speed it up a bit? I really have to be somewhere! Hmm don't we all? You know what why don't I can ask the flight captain if we can throw out some of the difficult passengers in economy class. I saw some fatties, but maybe we should spare the kids. What do you think? - This will have consequences. - Okay. - What kind of game is this? Show me. - This is the coolest game in the world. Does the female lead at least get clothes when you reach the next level? Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking with a short status update. We have just passed the Faroe Islands, and we will comitted to U.S. Air monitoring in about an hour. In another Three and a half hours we will be landing at JFK Airport. So enjoy your flight. What did you expect? He just visited Europe. -They should be happy to leave. -You're right about that! You alright? I have a headache ... Guys! There's fucking something out the plane! What?! Everybody calm down! I'll be right back. Fuck... 05-01. We will reach the object in 40 seconds. - Multiple readings. - Approaching target. Prepare the pulse device. - Get ready for the pulse device. - I'm ready to shoot. - Get ready boys! - Yeah! Do it. Fire pulse! Thank you! We made it! -They mutate to defend themselves. -Shit! Okay, listen to me very closeley now. Your father suspected that something like this could happen. He gave me this. In case it is doesn't turn out. This is the antidote that keeps your sister from falling to greater evil. If she turns, give her a fucking shot. Hi dad. We're in a pretty bad situation here. You know what's going happen here tonight never was my intention. You have to believe me. It could get worse? We use innocent people as live bait! I swear, I'll retire once this is over. Anyway... How is Diabla? She claims it's the flu, but we both know better. Listen, there is one thing you need to understand. Everything is connected with everything. They can feel Diabla's presence, and they want her. Are you out of your mind? Are we just guinea pigs for you? No, no, no don't worry. They wont harm her. They see her as one of their own, but ... Just look after her. Will you? - Is that the reason why I'm here alone? - No, you're not alone. But I'm too old for the battlefield. I can be of more help here. U.S. Navy patrol should send shot 30 minutes ago. The pulse did not work. The Sky Sharks are stronger. They mutate to defend themselves. I believe Himmelsfaust and the Sky Sharks may be on their way here to New York. What do they want on the eastern seaboard? I got a daughter goes to Columbia College. Why do they coming to land? I think they want to kill their maker. I'm the only one who can create an antidote and reverse the programing. They need to know that I'm working on a way to neutralize them. My God! They will destroy New York! This is why, ladies and gentlemen ... ... our only choice is to let the genie out of the bottle. Project Dead Flesh. Project Dead Flesh ... May God have mercy. I thougth that was some story to they told in the corporation? Something the agents can tell their children in at night to scare them. So your telling me that there really is a ProjectDead Flesh? What is Project Dead Flesh? It all started when the U.S. losing in Korea and Vietnam. I had come over in 46 from Germany with the help of Project Paperclip. For a few years, I was just a side kick to the U.S. generals, but in March 68, after the massacre of Maylay, I came into the picture. That was when Project Dead Flesh project was born. All of a suddenly I got all the fundings and all the support I asked for. And nobody was asking questions. My team and I moved the lab over to Fort Hammerhead on the border at Da Nang. Project Dead Flesh was about creating the perfect soldier. Resistant, indestructible and unstoppable. We called him Damian. My team implanted neuroreceivers in the brains of fallen soldiers to be able to control them. With microwaves in the lower beta range, allowed impulses from one brain to be sent to another. I wanted full control of my super soldier. My technology had always worked in the lab, but now we had a chance to test it in the field. We were given permission to use an imprisoned Charlie unit as guinea pigs. My special unit infected them with K7B, and my team and I documented their morphing into bloodthirsty vietcong zombies, who were suppoed to attack Camp Hammerhead. We knew that the U.S. unit would lose against Charlies army of the dead, but we had an ace up our sleeve. We flew there my super soldier Damian. A Green Basque soldier trained to maneuver behind enemy lines. What others call hell he called his home. He was active service between 67 until 69, when a bullet killed him in the field. His body reacted to K7B in a unpresedented way. The good soldiers from Camp Hammerhead had just come back from a regular mission and did not know what was coming at them. They expected to have a quiet night and to rest after a few drinks. Damian was in sleep mode. We connected his brain to my assistant, Dr. Greene, to control his thoughts and movements. We woke Damian and got him ready for his mission. Everything exactly as planned. Open the gates. The Vietcong zombies attacked Camp Hammerhead. All hell broke loose and Dr. Greene started to control Damian through the wire connect. Everything unfolded precisely as planned. It was a full success. Damian was unstoppable. But there was one flaw: Dr. Greene. Unfortunately, secretive adrenaline in Dr. Green's blood circulation disrupted transmission. First he got cramps, and then he twiched. Damian tore the receiver from his head, and fell into an unprecedented bloodlust. We lost control. He was unable to distinguish between friend or foe. The experiment failed. I stood there, could only watch, could only wait until the smoke had dissipated. Until the K7B had broken down in Damian. Considering it was a disaster, still something amazing came out of it. I had finally found the error in the system. You can't break a dead persons will. Somewhere between all the muscles, bones and blood Every organism has its own unique energy. But now, with the help of modern nanotechnology, I can overwrite the will of any given individual. This is the solution! - What is the combat status? - I'm K7B! Megalodon ready. Holy shit! Go get them, boys! Fuck them up! Step one. Good job, everybody. Yeah! That's what I want to see! It's raining BBQ fucking cat fish! Yeah! She shot me. Don't act like a pussy. Were safe now, sir. Danger averted. Every zombie dead. You're safe now. The plane is under control again. I wish you a pleasant flight home. Security sign in required. Authorisation granted. -Chardonnay or sake? -Or a little spicy tuna? What? We will order seafood pizza. Were gona be at your place in two hours. Take what you prefer, is fine with me. Are you okay? Yes, just fine. Just get here will you. - Are you ready to talk about your retirement plans? Dad - Later. What the Fuck is wrong with him? Maybe he's just getting old! Warriors of New Germany.
