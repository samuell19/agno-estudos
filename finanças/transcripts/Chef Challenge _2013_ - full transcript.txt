Green and white asparagus, carrots, your celery, apples, chervil. By the way, no grapes. They were too green. And your lamb. Peppers. OK. 4.15 this afternoon. You won't forget? SHARED TASTE MENU OF THE DAY - Class swot, chives. - Yes, chef. Hot. Such a clumsy goose. It's busy again today. Lost your memory? Can you remember a day when it was only half-full? OK, let's get going. The amnesiac, you finish the lamb. - Class swot, carrots. - Yes, chef. Clumsy goose, don't just stand there. Chef! Yes, chef. - Chives... - Yes. NO DOGS NO CHILDREN What are you doing here? Clear off. Go on! Clear off! Shoo! I don't want you here! Move over. Lamb next. Let me taste. Good. Dress them. Send them. Watch out. They're hot. Wait! Has anyone seen my dog? I left him outside and he's gone. His name is Cyprien. Usually I keep him with me, but... Don't worry. We'll find him. I'll come with you. What? The sign says: "No dogs, no children." Victor... You get me every time. I don't want to go. We'll go around. I have to come down here. Why doesn't Fran√ßois come to me? His father came to see me. And why did he retire? A doctor shouldn't retire. It's not good for people's health. Come on. I'll wait for you. - Have a good day. - You too. 4.30. It's my turn. Victor... The Victor from the restaurant? We had finished. Oh, OK. As mayor, do you treat the village as you do your patients? Kind of offhanded, "Next." What's she talking about? The village is an obsession for him. He'd sacrifice his life for his village. We do wonder why. I didn't know. Sorry. You could at least have knocked. Right, my results. No beating around the bush. I can't bear it. You have polyarteritis nodosa of the heart. Your heart is being enclosed in a fatty shell which protects it but stifles it. It's too far advanced to operate. There's no drug treatment either. You must ease up, even in the kitchen. If you slow down, it'll be fine. I'm going to die. How long? One year. Maybe more. It's my heart. I've got another year. Anyway, I don't care. It's about time. It was time 30 years ago. I know it makes you sad but you'll manage very well without me. We managed without Maria. There's no reason why you won't. Everyone dies one day. There's no point in making yourself ill about it. Don't think it's going to change anything or that I'll slow down. Why? What would I gain? The problem is my restaurant. When I'm dead, who will take over Chez Victor? No one, with a bit of luck. Or more likely it'll be Chez Bucon. And that's just unbearable, Ferdinand. My restaurant mustn't die. It must live on. You must look for a successor. I must look for a successor. I'm looking for a successor. I'll find him, train him for a year - and retire. - No. Yes. I won't hold you to your contracts in the changeover. If you want to stay, fine. If you don't, I'll pay you severance. - You're joking... - That's it. Discussion over. To work. - Why not me? - Yeah. Not in a month of Sundays. I said to work. - Maybe he's in love. - Come off it. With Victor women are here for five minutes and then leave. Women are like glue. If you're not careful, you can't get rid of them. Why did he say that to me? It's a bit early but I can work hard. If I work hard I'm sure I can do it. He'll never let go of his restaurant. - I see. - What do you see? - You want the restaurant. - I want the restaurant? Have you seen me? Why do you think I've been here 25 years? Victor pulled you out of the ditch and told you, "When you're 20 you shouldn't sleep it off at 7am, "and not outside my place. We're working. "Potato peeling. Can you manage that?" I realised a long time ago that Chez Victor is Victor. There are no second or third ranks. There's one chef and that's it. And if you don't like it, tough. There's only one chef. It's Victor. He won't move. I'll still put myself forward. As you like. Anyway, he's not likely to find his successor. That's for sure. I've done it like you said. One potential successor per day for one month. And 3pm, not 3.05. I certainly don't need them to be late. Faster. No, slower! Have you put in the basil? Not yet? Faster! Benjamin. What are you looking at? Clear off. Get out! Sticky, bland, awful, there's no seasoning, disgusting! Is it better like this? She's mad. I always say, "No women in the kitchen." Not bad. The white of the egg is hard. Not bad. What is it? No emotion in the kitchen, apart from in the cooking. Not bad, but he doesn't have what it takes. No. - Just good enough for a canteen. - Loser. You can keep your restaurant. No one's ever spoken to me like that! I don't like canteen food. It's frozen. We're not getting very far. He wanted to poison me with his mushroom omelette. - Are you alright? - Yes, I'm alright. - You must rest. - You go and rest. We prepare for service in an hour. Go on. I want to try. I've been here for three years, so why not? I cook "al dente" pasta like no one else. Even you say so. Very well. Fried egg with green beans. Hurry up before I change my mind. One millimetre of cooked yolk. Perfect. Toast is excellent. The beans... Crunchy and tender. All the same size. Nothing to say. It's good. It's good but it doesn't tell me anything. I eat your beans and nothing happens. You cook meticulously. You're good. Good for the brigade, but not to be the chef. You don't have what it takes. Not your fault. You either have it or you don't, and you don't. Go into the restaurant. So? I must keep working. I'll get there. Justine, the cutlery. That'll do. Enough! I won't put up with this! I won't put up with this, Benjamin! I've got a stain. Apron! It's a very bad sign in a kitchen. I'm going to die. I'll die of a stain. Benjamin, help! What's going on here? What about your siesta? Get out! Clear off, all of you! Get out of my sight! Out, I said! I don't want to see you any more! You ungrateful traitors! Chocolate, orange. Flat-leaf parsley. Cloves, nutmeg and... And what? What is it? This is the successor. I've found him. Benjamin! It's not possible. Benjamin! Where does Benjamin live? Must be thick. - Victor? - Where does Benjamin live? Right, then left. 3, rue de l'Envol. Crazy! It's the first time he's been to the village in 30 years. Benjamin! - Who made the tart? - Are you OK? - Who made the tart? - Her name's Annabelle. A woman? Just my luck. But she's very nice. - I want to see her. Where is she? - I'll show you. She's Gustave's granddaughter. He ran the butcher's shop and deli in the village. That's nothing new. Gustave was making the best pies in the region before you were born. She inherited her grandfather's house. I know this house very well. - Right. I'll leave you. - Benjamin... The chocolate tart. Cloves, nutmeg, parsley... What else? Don't you ever knock? I'm sorry. What else? Orange-blossom water. One drop. Oh, that's it. A teardrop of sweetness. This is when I'm depressed. Then I give them away. I'll taste them. All of them. Pumpkin, chestnut pastry. Traditional, but effective. The pieces of hazelnut are a little fine. It's a shame. It's not serious, but crush them instead of grinding. Otherwise you don't get the... Maple syrup. Not bad. And a touch of almond milk. Excellent. You're talented. You lack basic knowledge and rigour, but you're gifted. I'll teach you to cook for a year and you'll take over the restaurant. You know I'm leaving. It's all over the village. Yes. But no. No? You don't want the best restaurant in the region? No. I want a quiet life. I spent 10 years working in my father's company to please him. But I hate the building industry. We shared in the profits, 2.5%. But it wasn't enough. It was never enough. The day before he died, all he said to me was that we were down in the last quarter. I sold the company for nothing, just enough to live on for a year. But I realised I must do what I want and not what others want. So no. She says no and tells me her life story. Mad. The only one who can take over is mad. You must buck up your ideas, my girl. Who do you think you are? You think you'll get another chance like this? You won't. Exactly. That's typical. That's exactly what I don't do any more. I'm busy. I'm leaving. You can't deal with a madwoman. I'm inviting you to dinner. Tomorrow, Sunday, 7pm. Come and have dinner. No strings attached. Please. - Do what you like. - OK. Victor? - Good evening. - Good evening. - Sit down. - Aren't you eating with me? I'm not eating on my own. Thank you. Your thyme crust is delicious. How do you make it creamy like that? You put some cardamom in. I love it. You taste it. It's fantastic. So? How do you do your thyme crust? Egg yolk and cornflour. It's brilliant. Put your dish down. Normally we chink glasses now. Yes, really. Whipping cream in a risotto changes it completely. There's no whipping cream in a risotto. Yes. It changes it completely. We'll see what we'll see, Ms "It changes it completely". It's crazy. They're all the same size. You know what I'd like to know how to make? Sauces. I'm rubbish at sauces. So, when is it time, Ms "Whipping cream"? It's now. You do everything by guesswork. But you're not bad. My grandfather said that cooking comes from the heart. And she's off again. That was my grandfather. Those are my best childhood memories. - Do you have children? - Mind your own business! I'm listening to you. I don't have to answer you. No, I have no children. You wouldn't be here if I did. Now you know everything. Are you happy? Good. The way you stir is good. You've got the knack. Actually you're like a hedgehog. Prickly, but nice underneath. It's divine. Not bad. Stop it. It's yummy. We're good. A digestif? You can tell me what you think. I was right. My restaurant is for you. Won't you ever hear me out? I was saying... You're made for this. You want to do what you want, but that's cooking. You have talent. I'll teach you technique for a year. You'll be paid as a commis chef, Ms "Company-seller". Then you'll take over the restaurant and you can do what you like, in every sense. Alright. The house rules. You initial each page and then sign it. You're kidding. Do I look like I am? I don't like rules. You need them. That's how it works. Yes, but not too many, and not just any rules. - What? - I'm not allowed to wear red? Red blurs the vision. Vision is part of taste, therefore red blurs the taste. I love red. Alright, you can wear red. We'll negotiate. Except for no dogs and no children. - Why? - I won't give way on that. That's how it is. We can debate the rest. And whoever wins must drink. Agreed? OK. You're allowed to wear red, so drink. OK. So, a daily menu inspired by fresh produce. The sole supplier is Ferdinand. So every day we go to see Ferdinand. We leave here at 6.30 on the dot. Not a minute later. Are you going to sign? There. See you soon. 9.15 in the kitchen. I know. No need to thank me. See you soon. Be on time. I've found her. She's great. She has incredible talent. But she does what she wants. I can't keep her, she's aggressive. She was right about the whipping cream. She says I'm nice underneath, but that's not true. She contradicts me. She doesn't listen. She's stubborn. Couldn't be more so. She annoys me. She's very annoying. But she's so talented. What am I going to do? You'll make her your successor. - I'll make her my successor. - That's it. And now go to bed. And now I'll go to bed. We said, "On time." Come on. I went to bed at five and I'm 15 minutes late. And don't argue as well. They are on time. Who's this? - The successor. - Annabelle. Richard. At your service. Ask me anything and you'll get it. - We know each other. - Yeah... - Is this the successor? - I'm Annabelle. - I'm Justine. - Pleased to meet you. - And...? - Val√©rie. It's alright. I can still talk. OK. Chitchat is over. Today's menu. The conciliator general, you're on mains. Class swot, choose the wine. I've no time. Don't think about it, do it. Then come back to the kitchen. - Benjamin and silly goose, peeling. - Yes, chef. You, with me. Cutting turnips. You must say yes so the chef knows you heard. - Yes. - She has no uniform, of course. It's OK for today. Benjamin, an apron. Hurry. Right... For a fricassee we cut them in slices. Thin enough so they cook through and thick enough not to turn into mush. Five millimetres is ideal. Then it's all in the wrist to go faster, but we'll start slow. - So... - OK, I understand. You haven't understood, listened to or watched a thing. - It's the same. - The same? You've cut horizontally. I've cut vertically. Yes, it's the same. No, it's not, Ms "Know it all". Depending how you cut it, it tastes different. Right? Don't argue. Cooking is about talent, but it's also about technique and rigour. Yeah. And yours... Beyond compare. It's crunchy, soft. You're quite right. Taste it. Of course I'm right. Can you do it on your own? Flexible wrist, the blade always touching the board. - Ah, the wine? - Vin Jaune 2001. Not half bad. No need for that. It's good. Make the white sauce. - OK. - Not you. Her. She'll be able to do it when she knows her basics. For your sins you can do the parsley. As if you're using a chopper. And don't rip the leaves off. You were having me on about wearing red. Your aprons are red. I can renegotiate a rule. Claret. The aprons aren't red, they're claret. It's the same. No, it's not. You must learn to be precise. Yes, it's true. You know, we're a team. We should eat together. I know. I signed. Separate tables. But I'd had too much to drink. I'm sure of what I'm saying. I'm really not trying to annoy you. Do you always talk so much when you eat? I'd rather eat with you. It's more friendly. Who do you think you are to change things? - What's your problem? - It's that you've come from nowhere and you think you can do anything. She just doesn't know the rules. The restaurant is mine. I know how it works. Talent is 1% of success. The rest is work. True. You'll have to talk to Victor. He came to find me. In the end he'll realise I'm the best. Is she always like that or is it me? - She'll get over it. - It's not against you. No one likes change. I like you. And I love your jeans. Thanks. Is this new? - That's a homemade tomato sauce. - Great! Ferdinand, your carrots don't have skins. I love it. Don't touch anything! This is impossible. And don't you ever shut up? He's not easy, is he? Who is? - Right. Class swot, the veal stock. - Yes, chef. The social dancer, preparation of the soup. Yes, chef. - Silly goose, peeling and chopping. - Yes, chef. Benjamin, selection of the spices. Yes, chef. And Ms "Know it all" on the dessert. - Aren't tarts your department? - Annabelle. - What have I said now? - You said Ms "Know it all". I'm Annabelle. It's not nasty. Yes, it is nasty. - So is silly goose and class swot. - I can defend myself. I call people what I like. - OK. - Alright, alright. Don't make a fuss about it. Annabelle on tarts. And quickly. Who wants salad? It's the last ones. They absolutely love it. Hot. Sending. - No, wait! A drop of lemon. - To lift the coriander? - And to prepare the palate. - Yes! I love it. Victor, I adore you! Go on. - Justine, have you got a new bloke? - Yes. - Val√©rie, your pasta is great. - Thank you. - Classy. - So you break hearts? No. But why are you single? It's a terrible waste. A woman who can cook is a woman who must be married. - He can't help himself. - It's you who can't help yourself. What's the matter now? I'm not stupid, you know. Two months ago you couldn't slice a vegetable and now you're acting like the boss without telling him. Whereas I... Whereas you are perfect without him. Thanks. Is that it? A competition. Good idea. We'll have a competition. You'll choose who takes over the restaurant. - It won't count. - It's not for real. - No, it's a good idea. - It's ridiculous. Admit you're scared. OK. This afternoon we have an hour and a half. - You can even choose your dish. - Certainly not. We'll do an ingredients test. You can decide the rules. Perfect. - Are you sure that... - Yes. Right. One dish. No tarts. The ingredients are veal, peppers, courgettes, squash, aubergines, Jerusalem artichokes, flat parsley and balsamic. Are you sure that... OK. You have 45 minutes. Go. Stop. It's good! They're both excellent. This one's delicious. It's very subtle but you expect it. You don't believe in this one, but it works. It tells us a story. It's that one. OK. That's the game. It doesn't change anything. What's going on? What have you done in my kitchen? Unbelievable. It's obviously you. Can't you stay still for a minute? In 10 months you'll do what you like. Till then it's my kitchen. Don't touch anything. Val√©rie, the wine. Never seen her before? Where are your uniforms? Go! Tidy up and start preparing! What's the other one doing? Pressing the grapes? Richard, go and get her. I need her in the kitchen. Silly goose, take his place. Val√©rie? There you are. I was worried you might have gone. What would it matter to you? Anyway you prefer her. That's nonsense. You know me. I do my thing so everything goes smoothly. It makes me feel better. But you're my friend. I'm rubbish. I'm rubbish at everything. I was rubbish at the violin. I'm rubbish in the kitchen. I'm rubbish. You're not rubbish at all. - You're very good. - That's right. I'm good. Good enough for the orchestra. Good enough for the brigade. My father was right. You see? It's rubbish. I'm rubbish. No, you're not rubbish. You don't have a gift. It's not the same thing. You want a gift? You have one! But you don't see it because you're obsessed with your goal. A gift is when everything becomes easy, when you don't suffer, when you forget yourself. Does that happen to you? There you're a genius. Thank you. Right, I'm running late. Now dry your tears and blow your nose. I can't stand emotional outpourings. Come on. What? Does everyone have to get involved in everything here? She's alright. Back to work. Go, go, go. Go on. The aubergine? Deseeded, so it's not squidgy. We could add sugar to caramelise it a little with the magret. And a touch of chilli to counter the sweetness. - So no sweet peppers. - Fennel instead. - Brilliant. - Who's the chef? Chef. What? A red Pessac-L√©ognan. A good structure with toasted and exotic notes, which will go well with the duck. But it's not so good with ratatouille. Unless the ratatouille is more spicy. A very good choice. Isn't it, Annabelle? Couldn't be better. What's up with her, the silly goose, Justine? Never seen me before? And the rest of you. Get to work! Answer it. Hello? Yes, this is Chez Victor. Well... Fix a date. Take the number. No, ask them to call back. Put them on the waiting list. I can take your reservation from 25 August onwards. I know it's in five months but we're full till then. Waiting list, but at their own risk. If you like I'll put you on the waiting list but it's at... I mean, we can't guarantee that anything will come up. Yes, we'll still have our two chefs. 2 September? OK. For five people. Perfect. Thank you. Have a good day. Goodbye. Great. Chef, we're full for the next five months. That's no reason for so much noise. It stops me sleeping. Chez Victor. Hello? They're going to build an organic chicken shed. Marie, clear the table. Let's get to work, boys. Richard said it's full for the next eight months. We all know Richard exaggerates. Well, I'm full for the next three months. I've even taken on a young lad to help me. - Some new blood at last. - Hey. My son's coming back to help me. We'll make an eating area in the barn. A grocer's shop and bistro is a good idea. I'm going to try your chestnut flour. I'll come back for coffee. My best customer. And new blood for someone. He's always looked at her like that. Don't you remember? She spent her holidays here as a child. She was in the shop with Gustave. And you watched her just like now. And you didn't dare speak to her just like now. Anyway, it's good that she's here. He agreed to put in three extra tables? Yeah. It goes to show things are changing. A couple booked three months ago, but they have a child. And? - No dogs, no children. - It's rule number one. Richard, when Victor isn't here, I decide. Justine, give them a table. I take responsibility. Go on. What's this? What's it doing here? I don't want children in my restaurant! Whose is it? Who did this? Is it you, silly goose? Get out! Out! I don't ever want to see you again. You're fired! - It's not her, it was me. - I don't care. She's fired! You see what you make me do? No children! I said no children! It's not difficult. In fact I was wrong. You're irredeemable. There's nothing in you to be saved. I resign. I'm leaving. That's right. You go! Go! You'd have sold it anyway, like your father's company! What? Your thyme crust is delicious. How do you make it creamy like that? You put some cardamom in. I love it. Better take a look. - The bouillon is too salty. - Too salty? Too salty. OK, what can we do? Justine, bring back all the bouillons. We'll replace them with carpaccio and tomatoes. Val√©rie. Benjamin, leave the fennel. Help Val√©rie. Right. No, not at all. The chef isn't depressed. Shall we make another date? I'll call you back when he's better. Alright. Goodbye. This is a disaster. What's the matter? "When a chef is depressed, his cooking becomes sad. "If you like soup with a grimace, go to Chez Victor." It's on the biggest amateur food critics' website. It's been up for four days and now it's everywhere. That's why the cancellations are coming in. It's a disaster. Marinated lemons, cherries in brandy, clementine jam... That's yesterday's list. An over-salty bouillon. Victor, you're losing your head and your cooking. She was a good girl. You just need to back down a little. There are adjustments to be made. Like with your food combinations. Sometimes it excites the palate, it surprises, it irritates. But in the end it's good. And it drives everything forward. Give me what you like. - Victor. - You're up early. - I knocked. - Yes. - Can I come in? - Yes. I brought you this. I don't need it in the kitchen any more. - You're eating that? - Is there a rule about it? Yes, you can't eat ready foods. There's too much salt, too much sugar. You'll ruin your taste. The palate takes months to recover. In spite of what I've taught you, you're still doing the wrong thing. Would you please leave? I don't need you in my kitchen. I've finished the vinaigrette. What shall we do for the main? We'll do chicken with herbs. - Which herbs? - Traditional, so we can't go wrong. Chives, parsley, thyme and bay. Tables six and nine want to leave. They say an hour's wait is too long. While they wait give them... Serve them a glass of Domaine d'Ott 2006 with green tapenade. Tapenade will kill the taste of it. We're closing. No service today. We can't close. It's impossible. It's not possible to... Victor is in a bad way. He closed in mid-service. We don't care about his moods. This isn't just about him. True. Does he know what he's doing? We're all going under with him. My bistro has lost money for three weeks. OK, we used to get by without it, but... Well, I can't get by. I'm in deficit for the first time in 30 years. I haven't sold a newspaper, let alone any sweets or ice creams. The hotel has been three-quarters empty for two weeks. He's always been selfish. He doesn't care about others. It's easy to kick a man when he's down. I don't need any lessons from you. - No! - Calm down. Sit down. We have other problems. We must resolve all these things for Victor and for the village. What do you mean, the village? We'll do the same as everyone. Shut our doors, end of story. Claude, if you can't be constructive, you may leave. It annoys you when people tell the truth. Right, Mr Mayor? Well, I'm going, and I'm pleased to go. - Yeah, leave. - Very clever. Richard, Val√©rie, can you take over the restaurant? Between us, we can do our best. That's all. And Ferdinand? He says it's bad and Annabelle should come back. We can't force her. We've all tried to get her back already. I'll try again. OK. Thank you, Richard. I know you don't want to talk any more. But, please, it's important. Come in. You haven't lost your taste for cooking. - Why do you say that? - Well... He, on the other hand, can't cook any more. - What do you mean, he can't cook? - He needs you. Before he could cook very well on his own, but now he can't. It's all in his head. Things are running around in there. You can almost see his brain whirring. Seriously, it's getting critical. It's bad for him, it's bad for us and for the village. You have to come back. He came to find you. That's a big deal. No, he brought back my apron. Anyway, that's not the question. He's the one who wanted me to cook. I know what suits me. What, this? OK, that's it. I don't need any lessons from anyone. You all get on my nerves. Are you doing it deliberately or what? But these are just amateur daubs, and of food! Do you want me to spell it out? You're proud and you're stubborn. In fact, you're like him. You're exactly like him. Thank you, for the tea and the smile. Are you leaving? I'm going to see if I can help somewhere. Victor? We could take out the three tables. It would be good to make it like it was before. No? No. There's nothing wrong with me. He's annoying me. Leave him. I'll see to him. Ten. That's a bit low. You need to rest. Not you as well. Are you alright? I was so scared. I'm alright. I've talked to the insurers. The adjuster will come today. Why? We're closing. I'll still pay you, obviously. Victor, let them take care of things and then you'll get back to cooking. I don't want to get back to cooking. I don't want to do anything! I want to be left alone... - Alright, Doctor? - Yes. He's exhausted. There's his polyarteritis. His vital signs are weak. We'll keep him for observation. I'll try to see him in each of my consultations. Very well. And do we tell them about the polyarteritis? No. Patient confidentiality. Ferdinand knows. See you tomorrow, Doctor. So? He had a blackout, but he's better now. He's asleep and stable. We'll take care of him. - You should go now. - I'm staying. Come in. Hello! Work has started and when you come out it'll be like it was. In the meantime, this will make you feel at home. Today we have prepared a salad of scallops and courgettes, a rocket and leek salad, a nice Marengo, and also pasta with basil, very simple, the way you like it. Val√©rie timed it. It's perfect. Don't eat the hearts. They're just to look nice. Hello. Your friends have brought you food again and you still haven't eaten. I don't want it. Victor, three days is already too long. Four will be dangerous. You must eat. Right, everybody out. It's time for his treatment. Go on. You too. Oh, you're back. - I'm just here to move out. - Good. I'll take that and a loaf of bread. - You're really leaving? - Yeah. So you're going to help elsewhere? You don't want to help here? - Never mind. I won't buy anything. - Victor blew up his kitchen. What? - He's in hospital. - I have to see him. Victor... No, not her. - Please... - No! Come along. It's not your fault. He has nothing against you. But it's too much for him. Too many emotions, too many changes. He doesn't know how to be any more. And he hasn't eaten for five days. - He hasn't eaten for five days? - No. The others bring him his favourite dishes every day, but... He has no taste for anything any more. We have to make him want to eat again. I'll try. I've prepared a food basket for him, if you'll take it. Don't tell him it's me or he won't want it. I made a... Well, it might make him curious. Well, I think it might. If you don't mind... I'm sorry. A small salad of citrus and king prawns. Next we propose... wild Scottish salmon cooked on one side on a parsnip pur√©e with Ferdinand's green beans. Smell that. And since you always like to finish with something sweet, a fruit salad from the orchard. There. Well, I wish you "Bon app√©tit". Come in. I've nearly finished. I've made a lentil salad with a rosemary infusion. I know it might seem... Oh, it's a delegation. I know you want your freedom, but as you've started cooking again... - It'd be good if you take over. - When the restaurant is finished. Until Victor comes out of hospital. No. You know, the restaurant is the heart of the village. - Does he agree? - We haven't told him yet. - He'll think we don't need him. - And he'll say no. But we need him, and the restaurant. Not just for the village. Without him, I'd be on my own. So would I. Well, there's my mum too, but... It's important. It's temporary. As soon as he's better, we'll tell him. Annabelle, you should do it. No. I don't want to do it behind his back. - Ferdinand? - Come in, Annabelle. Sit down. - You should take on the restaurant. - Oh, not you as well. It's good for the restaurant and for you. It's a shame you're not where you should be. - Victor can't stand me. - Victor is like you. He doesn't always know what's good for him. And what's good for him is good for the restaurant. And that's you. Afterwards you can do what you like. Listen. - Annabelle, are you alright? - No. But yes. No, I don't want to take over without telling him. But yes, I'll do it. That's good. All this because of a tart. 10cm doesn't mean 15cm. It changes the light. - OK, we'll make it 15cm, then. - That's it. Thanks. And for the chrome, it's matte, not shiny. It changes the taste. I'll show you where the induction lights go. It's normal. Absolutely normal. 18 covers. Here we go. You're better. I'm pleased. Your dinner. They brought it this afternoon when you were asleep. You should have woken me. I will next time. - May I? - Go ahead. Thank you. And you have another dish. So let me go over it again. You dip the chicken pieces in flour. Then you brown them on both sides. You need a high heat and olive oil. Nurse, nurse! I won't put up with this! And he wanted to leave. It's the first day we've been full. It's great. - You must tell him I've taken over. - It's too soon. - It's working well like this. - The phone is ringing again. - It's best not to. - He's coming out in two weeks. Tell him. That's all. He might get angry and have an attack. It'll be the same whenever you do it. No. We'll tell him when he's in his kitchen. Agreed? Nurse! Where is she, then? Nurse! Someone should be looking after me. Normally you come at 6.30pm on the dot. Excuse me. You're very well. You'll leave in five days. You're going to start cooking again? You'll miss your food baskets. Come in. You can have lunch with me. Sit down. You've made progress. I know the food baskets aren't from Richard. Only you could do it. When you brought me back the apron I didn't understand. I confused it with what my father would have done. He said such mean things to me. When you say mean things, I hear him and I go into a spin. It's stupid. I know it can work. Remember how we were at your first dinner? It was simple. We just need to stop being afraid. You and me. I'd like that. The restaurant, you and me. I like that. I like that. About the restaurant... You still talk just as much. Do you want me to call someone? It's my heart. It's being surrounded by fats. It's being stifled. There's nothing to be done. Don't look like that. It won't happen tomorrow. I was just told not to over-exert myself. You mustn't give me too much trouble. Victor... Please. Thank you. You see? I know how to say thank you. It's good. - What do you mean, it's good? - It is good. Victor! - Victor! - Leave me! No, please. I know what you're thinking. Leave me alone! Ferdinand. - Have you come out already? - She's betrayed me. She took over the restaurant without me. And you knew. And you didn't tell me. I really can't trust anyone. I don't want to see you ever again. - That's enough. - What? You've got the wrong idea and you're saying the wrong thing. Annabelle took over the restaurant because the others asked her to. She didn't want to at first. I insisted and she said yes because it was a good thing. Then she wanted to tell you. But the others were scared of your reaction. Not Annabelle. But as you're an idiot she had her doubts too. You ruin everything. She's the best thing to happen to you in 30 years, since Maria... What is life? A life where you count for no one and no one counts for you? A life like a ruler, with everything programmed, everything set? No, that's death. It's death before death. You should think about that. Will you make me a coffee? Annabelle, can I talk to you, please? Yes, of course. This is where you get the best view. Sit down. My wife's name was Maria. We met when we were 20. We fell in love right away. She introduced me to cooking. She was gifted. Then one day we decided to set up a restaurant, so we travelled around and we came here. It was beautiful. The land and the house belonged to Ferdinand. He sold them to me. We did up the house and set up the restaurant together. It was good. It was hard, but we loved it. Then Maria became pregnant. I completely panicked. I wasn't ready. Well, I didn't feel capable. I didn't feel capable of being a father. When she had the baby I didn't even go to see them in hospital. I got yelled at by Ferdinand, but I couldn't. I couldn't. It was a boy. I had a son. Maria didn't want to name him right away. She said on the phone that we'd choose together. And I let her come back from hospital on her own with the baby. I was expecting them. I'd prepared a nice dinner. It was the police who arrived. They said... They said, "Your wife and your son were hit by a hit-and-run driver." "They died immediately," they said. Your wife... and your son. I didn't want to see the baby. Maria was beautiful. She was really beautiful. I often say to myself that the baby must have looked like her. I'd have liked to tell her that I wanted to call him Romain. I think she'd have liked that. She'd have liked that. - When's he coming, then? - He's not coming. What do you mean? No, I don't want him. We can raise the prices, but it's too complicated. I've found out about him. In the end Victor was right. - What do you mean? - He's too young to know. The baron had two stars. Yes, sir and madam. And he gave it all up. - I'm going to be late! - What do you mean, late? 3pm doesn't mean 3.05. You'll have your work cut out. She's as crazy as he is. Tables six and nine want potatoes instead of vegetables. - We already said... - No potatoes with duck. It dries it out. - Do they like carrots and turnips? - Yes. Then they don't mess about and they eat. Send it. Go on! We could add some strips of orange peel. Madeleines are plain. Madeleines can be how one wants. Madeleines are plain and if you're not careful it'll be on the floor. Are you alright? Yes, I'm alright. Go to bed. I'll look after them. It's your turn tomorrow. You'll have a hard day. Who thought of accepting a christening party? Go on. Victor? See you tomorrow, Ferdinand. Are you going? Yes. You're perfect. I'm going to rest. - See you later. - See you later.
