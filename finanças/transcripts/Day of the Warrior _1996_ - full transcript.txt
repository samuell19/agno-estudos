You could own me if you just call me cobra. Lethal force security code compromised. Tiger, Amanda black is in a budget meeting. Red alert, Sherry. Washington has to protect our funding. I'll make black hawk aware of that immediately. Red alert. I'm relying on you. I'll handle it commander. There's been unauthorized access to our master computer here in Dallas by supercomputer in Washington. It's only a matter of time before they identify your agents in the field. Doc Austin is in south Texas about to bust open the warriors fine art smuggling network. Cobra's in Beverly hills deep cover posing as an exotic dancer. She's plugged into his diamond pirating scam. Our other two agents, shark and scorpion are in Las Vegas. They've infiltrated the warrior's porno operation. Dammit. We've got to get word to them. They're in danger. The warrior 1s our top priority. If this break in is connected to him, he'll kill them all. Hey! You ok? You ok? All right, Jeep's in the woods. Go get it and bring it back. Hey. Mexico's 50 miles that way. Start walking. Give me the gun, Juan. There's no way to contact the agents. They're scattered all over. If we call them, it'll blow their cover. Tiger, how long has it been since you've been in the field? About two years. Well get it together, sweetheart. You're going out again. I'll contact Jordan in Washington and fill him in. Then I'm off to Vegas to warn shark and scorpion. I'm teaming you up with Tyler ward. Your assignment is to find doc Austin. Tyler is at the Dallas air station just outside of town. He's taking his yearly proficiency tests. I don't trust anyone else. Colonel. Nice flying, major ward. Us reserve could use more men like you. Just missed out on desert storm. You're the ones who saw real action. Speaking of real action, there's a beautiful young lady from us internal affairs waiting to see you. Thanks. Tyler, big trouble. The security code has been violated. We think it's a warriors people. They could have a mole in Washington. My god. That means our four agents on this case will be hung out to dry. Willow is trying to locate shark and scorpion in Las Vegas. What about cobra? Is she still in Beverly Hills? Yeah, in deep cover posing as an exotic dancer. We haven't figured out how to reach her without revealing her presence to the other side. Our assignment is to find doc Austin. He's in south Texas just this side of the Mexican border. We've got to bring him in from the cold. Bring him in from the cold? That's real spy talk. I love it when you do that. Affirmative, top dog. Now, let's clear the area. Kym, this is better than I expected. Paintings from the great masters of Europe, gold and Colombian art from south America and Mexico, the warrior will be pleased. Our share will be worth millions. Manuel, you are a genius. I'm proud to be with you. You should be. Here's your nephew, sir. Two Mexican federales had him. Caught them on this side of the border. Totally illegal. They were beating him to get him to talk. Did you kill them? Not quite, but I got their attention. Hey, don't worry. You know they didn't check with the rangers before they chased Juan in Texas. I smoked the radio in Jeep. It's a two day walk to civilization. By then our work here will be finished. Good thinking. Killing federales, even the crooked ones, could cause a real problem. Juan, you are my nephew. You stole from me, then you were stupid enough to let the Mexican police catch up with you. I should have let them keep you, but you would have talked. We don't have all day. Not to worry. You I trust. I could use more men like you. Load these things into the Van. We must deliver these goods to the warriors cabin on lake Dallas. Clean up the area. We're abandoning this location. We'll be back for you in three days. It's a long drive, my dear, almost to Dallas. What would you do to entertain me? Oh, I'll think of something. Here he is, boss, the guy the boys caught snooping around the cabin at the lake. He's a fed. I was out camping. I got lost. He's a bad ass, boss. It took four of them to take him. He broke a few bones before they got him down. Get in there. I'm going to give you a break. If you take me, you walk away clean. In fact, I'm going to fight you with one hand tied behind my back. Delicious. Bring more. Latest weather report from Malibu climate looking great. Two surf nerds downloading soon into your mainframe. Just as I hoped. If anyone has infiltrated our operation, we'll know within a few hours. Our contact man in Washington has succeeded in breaking into the lethal force computer system. Who's that? All you got to know is his code name, hard drive. Hard drive. Mr. drive has spoken with his two proteges, new blood, a couple of high shots from Malibu. They have no police record. They're suppose to be two of the best hitters around.

We slipped them through customs yesterday morning with our regular shipment from South Africa. My god, they're beautiful even uncut. Yes, they are. Count them and sign this inventory. This is a one time operation. Warrior knows this. It's far too dangerous to ever try this again. Notice, I'm putting your signed piece of paper in the case of the diamonds. I'm sealing the case. This is a key to a post office box in Beverly Hills. Here take this case, put it in the post office case, and destroy the key. Do this immediately exactly as I've instructed.

How long have you been using this act as your cover? Six months. Not exactly packing them in. Hey, I haven't hit my stride yet, babe. Yeah, right. Fu, I have a suite here at the hotel, and we have a lot to cover. Ah so. This guy, warrior, who the hell is he anyhow? The bastard was on our side. He was a world class athlete. Won gold medals in wrestling and two international events. He was a perfect candidate for the CIA. He did damn good work for the CIA in Russia for four years. Then the cold war ended. Like many other agents, he was dismissed. His services were no longer needed. Warrior's mother was part American Indian. So after his Russian gig, he came back to this country. With his great athletic ability, he became a professional wrestler. In memory of his mother's heritage, he put on war paint and called himself the supreme warrior. With this masquerade, he was able to travel throughout the world as a professional wrestler. Through contacts he made when he was with the CIA, he set up a black market network. He was able to smuggle fine art out of Europe, especially from Russia, diamonds from Siberia, and gold and silver and precious artifacts from Mexico. The sobs even into pirating porno films, and he's involved in furnishing women for clients in the mideast, white slavery if you will. Can you believe this guy? Yeah, I can. As we asians say, truth is stranger than fiction. Cool it with that rice petty crap, fu. Continue, grasshopper. I'm here because shark and scorpion have infiltrated his porno business, and now that the warrior has access to our computers, their lives are in imminent danger. If we don't get to shark and scorpion fast, they're going to get whacked. Since you were stationed here, I wanted to recruit you to help me find them before it's too late. The last time shark contacted me, he said he and scorpion would be working in an industrial park area but they did not know which one or where. Due to security reasons, I'm unable to make contact with them. Shark did say that they would be driving a white Audi station wagon with Louisiana plates. All we can do is hit it in the morning, try to find that white wagon and them. We're approaching the area where doc was last contacted. Man, there are a lot of trees down there, not like west Texas where I'm from. It's really flat where I come from. How flat is it? It's so flat when your dog runs away from home, you can see him for three days. That's flat. Hey, look at the map. There's a hunting cabin up ahead. We'll spend the night there. Is there room service? Yeah, right. When hard drive recommended you, he said you have a certain flair for the absurd. I see your cover's that of a couple of California surfers. You got it. You are”? Smith, sir. And you are”? Barney, sir. Smith and Barney. Yes, sir. They're code names. Not our real names. Not our real names. Can either one of you work a video camera? Dude, are you kidding? We're totally celluloid literate, cyberspace film school two day intensive. Isn't it amazing what you can learn on the net? Enough. You'll take the next plane to Vegas. Your instructions are in here. Radical. Go. You, Mr. Barney, my name is not dude. I can dig it. Do that. Dig it. That damn owl again. Shut up. Kym, the fax. My, my, my. What's it say? There's strong evidence that gringo friend, doc Austin, is working both sides of the fence. I will take care of it personally. Well, what do we do? I said shut up. Fax this to warrior. Finish loading these things into the cabin and guard it with your life. Ok, kym, get in. We have a long drive back to our camp. That Southern owl is an endangered species. Well, it's not endangered anymore. You think you'll need that? Never doubt. Explosive tip. Everything I touch has a way of exploding. Mind if I try it sometime? Be my guest. There's something I have to get off my chest. \what is it? This. How do you like these? I just got them. Really? Who had them before? Hello? Scorpion, I do believe. My name is, Pete. Pete, and I'm stoked. We've heard about you and shark, and we've seen your audition tape. Now we're ready to do it big time for all the world to see. We've been waiting for your call. Where should we meet you”? No, no, no, no, no, no, you don't meet us. We'll pick you up. We have a lot of props. Perhaps, we should follow you. They have props. Ok, that may do. You stay right where you are. We'll be in touch. Hey, at last we have their trust. We'll be on the inside. If we have to be performers in a porno film to do it, so be it. Yeah, we may as well give it the whole nine yards. It'll distract them. Then we'll nail the bastards. I think we should rehearse until they get here. Shark, you two start without me. Should be about a half a mile up the road. Juan's getting a little ripe. Son of a bitch is heavy. You know something, the dead deserve respect. I'm going to give this guy a one gun salute. Dammit. Fu, I'm calling Jordan right now. They call that foreplay. Ok, I understand. Tyler and tiger have gone to locate, doc. You and fu are in Las Vegas searching for shark and scorpion. How the hell did this leak out, Jordan? You told me this couldn't happen. We are trying to locate the problem. Obviously, it's internal here in Washington. Dietrich and I are on our way to Dallas. Locate your people. Meet us there the day after tomorrow. I'll need more time. If I'm successful here, I'll need to locate cobra in Beverly Hills. Cobra's on her own, Willow. You can't mean that. The hell I can't. You have your orders. Dallas, two days. We've got to salvage what we can from this mess. I don't trust that bastard. Come on, fu, let's go. I have a way to contact cobra. With this phone, I can activate her warning device. Her device will respond in 60 seconds. It's a code red signal, return to Dallas home base immediately. So do it, Willow. It's not that simple, fu. Why? The warrior's people could intercept the signal. And if they know she's being warned, they'll kill her immediately. But we have no choice. Hey, where's Tony? He came down with 3 real bad headache. I'm filling in. Boy, my pool man's really going to be pissed. I hope it doesn't clog my filter. Hey, that looks like Manuel's car. Something's up. He ain't supposed to be back until tomorrow. Grab him! Hold it. So you gringo bastard, you work for Jordan. This will be fun getting you to talk. Take him inside. They're shooting down. Come on. Kym, get in your car. Kym, stay down. Ah, damn. That son of a bitch has got a big gun. You wanted to try this? Be my guest. Yeah. Here. Flat. Nice to see you, doc. Yeah. Damn it, how'd this happen? These bastards trusted me. I've been here for two months. I was this close to getting everything we need to nail him. I discovered a security leak in the computer system. The four agents on this mission are on red alert. You mean someone on our side is giving us up? Afraid so. Ain't life grand? Matter of fact, it ain't. Let's go, doc. We got a plane over here. What's the status on the others, cobra, shark, and scorpion? Cobra's on her own. Willow is trying to locate shark and scorpion in Vegas. This used to be a sleepy little town. Now look at it. There must be dozens of industrial areas. Finding a white Audi station wagon is going to be tough. This must be them. Shark and scorpion, this is Pete. I'm Charlie. We're going to make a hell of a film. Oh, yes, we are. Flight 1628 departing Los Angeles for Dallas fort worth international airport is ready for immediate boarding at gate 41b. Come on, man. It's your turn. Take off the robe. We need to go handheld. (Get some sounds. Oh, oh, baby. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, you're so good. Oh, I love you, baby. Flight number 887 from Washington DC now arriving Dallas fort worth international airport gate number 24. Baggage claim is located in the lower level of the terminal. I'll get the car. The Dallas office is about 15 minutes from here. Hey, this way. I think we got some good stuff. Hey that was great but we're gonna need a few more shots. We'll meet you here tomorrow at noon? Cool. We set the line, dude. I et's see if the fishes bite. We have to meet with Jordan tomorrow. I can't wait. I've got a few things to settle with him. Welcome to Dallas fort worth international airport. Baggage for flight number 1628 can be claimed in carousel number two. Cobra here. I've arrived in Dallas. Ok, what's the combination? 1851. Let's go back. Try it. Shark, the camera recorded him going behind this screen. Look at this. They're counterfeiting every kind of film ever made. This is a multi-million dollar scam. Look at this little puppy. I'm good. I bet I'd get siskel and ebert's two thumbs up. I don't think so. This is one tape they're not going to get. We've got what we need. Let's get out of here. Chaz, here they come. It's shooting time, baby. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. We're getting them. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hey, this is cool. I can do this. Top of the world, ma. Gunshots, fu, around the corner. With you, babe. Let's go. Hey, we're doing pretty good. Did you see me hit the chick? Yeah, and I got the guy. Now go over there and finish them off. - Me? - Go ahead. I got you covered. They're hit, fu, they're hit. Get the phone and call for an ambulance. Damn you! How bad is it? Sure, Jordan. We'll escort them to the hospital. Make sure they're under 24 hour guard. I want you two back in my office by noon tomorrow. By the way, cobra checked in 10 minutes ago. She made it back here ok. Thank god. Hey, come here. There's someone locked up inside. Willow, I'm coming with you. Help, we're in here. Help, please help. Thank god. Thank you. What the hell happened to you guys? We were jumped vesterday by two maniacs. They tied us up and threw a dozen burgers at us. Yeah, with extra ketchup. You two must be the real Pete and Charlie. - Yeah, right. - That's right. I'm lucky to be alive. I could have died of indigestion. Right. Something's wrong. Tiger, you take the outside. You got it. Hey, it's ok, Tyler. Blondies home. Damn, cobra. You scared the hell out of me. You scared me too. I could use a little protection. What's the similarity between real estate and kissing? Location, location, location, location. Yeah. Ok, Tyler, yeah, I'll be right there. First I gotta get something off my chest. So shark and scorpion were only wounded, and you idiots knocked out Pete and Charlie at my studio. They worked for me, you morons. Hey, we went there. We told them who we were. They got real pissy with us. Yeah, yeah, they showed us no respect, man. We're college educated. My whole damn Vegas operation is up in smoke now. Well, who would have figured that fu and Willow would have showed up. Yeah, we're cool man, pros like us packing heat. Yeah. Yeah. Hand to hand with fu and Willow was out. Word on the street is that they're both black belts. Really? That's very interesting. Well, I'm going to give you two monkeys one more chance. (So work out. Get your bony little asses into shape. Your boy doc got away too. We were attacked, surrounded by a small army. Not to worry, sir. All the items were previously taken to your cabin at the lake. There was nothing left at my camp to implicate our operation. Hard drive wants his money tomorrow. You know what to do. Everything's going to be just fine. Just follow his orders. He can be brutal. By the way, where's your lovely associate, kym. I left her at the hotel. She was going to go shopping. Please, put in a good word for me with, warrior. Of course, Manuel. Don't worry. My dear, you are a woman of 1,000 faces. That's one way to put it. Kym, I don't know which part of your body to kiss first. Surprise me. No, absolutely not. He's responsible. Downright responsible. All right. All right. Settle down, everyone. We've gotta get back on track. Hey, track this, Jordan. You want to fire me? Be my guest. I can retire in two years, or you can can me now and pay me off. Four of us put ourselves on the line. We infiltrated the warrior's top operations, and your department let some turncoat jerk off give us up. Can I say something? Yeah. No, no, I mean something off the record. All right, sure. I'm not so sure you're not the jerk off who fingered us. Me? You son of a bitch. Yeah, you. Who else knew what we were up to and how to access the master computer in Washington? What was it, Jordan, money? What'd you get? 30 pieces of silver. You're crazy, doc. The only person in this room that can access the computer is tiger. I'm the only one as far as we know, but it can be done by any expert given enough time, data, and access codes. Face it, Jordan. It could be you. Why did you get so ticked off when cobra told you I contacted her on the red alert beeper? You could have compromised the whole operation. My call saved her life. You want to talk about shark and scorpion? The leak that put their asses at death's doorstep came from your end. It came from Washington. All right. Let's stop this. We aren't getting anywhere. I say when we've arrested the warrior and this operation is over, you kick Jordan's ass on general principles. What about you, Dietrich? Have you've got anything to say? I must advocate Jordan's feelings on this matter. The computer infiltration was an unfortunate incident. Unfortunate incident my ass. Dietrich, you're not in the field dodging bullets. Come on, folks. What are we going to do next? Let's consider our options. The warrior obviously has a central computer office somewhere in the city. We don't know where, but what we do know he has a home in the Nob Hill district of north Dallas, a very expensive gated community. He pretends to be a solid citizen, he frequents the arts, and he donates to charity. He puts up a very good front. We know his primary contraband. Paintings, artifacts, and gold were transported from Manuel's location in south Texas to a secluded barn on lake Dallas. Those artifacts are priceless. The Las Vegas porno operation, that was small potatoes just for kicks. The contraband from south Texas and the diamonds cobra handled in Beverly hills, that's his score. The warrior's consolidating. He's going to make a big move soon like out of the country. I can feel it. Tyler and I'll stake out his place in Nob Hill tonight and see we can come up with. Cobra, tiger, and fu can stay at our place in case you need them. That'll be fine. Willow, I'll need you for a while longer. We have a hell a lot of paperwork to cover. Sure. I'll get my files and be right back. I don't trust those bastards. You guys keep your asses covered. Yeah, that's why I mentioned the stakeout to see how they'd react. Which one of these cars belongs to Jordan and Dietrich? That white one right there. Good luck, guys. This should keep tabs on them. Ten. Man this working out stuff is killing me. Yeah, after this set we can have a cigarette break. There's a lot of construction going on around here. Doc, that's the warrior's place right over there. Are we on the same page here? Yes, sir. Everything is under control. The cowboys are in the woods behind us about 100 yards back. Do your thing. Don't screw up. It's our worst nightmare, Tyler, to have someone in our organization giving us up, probably for money. I'm going to drop out, grace my bike, get laid. Dammit, out the back, Tyler. Out the back. It's those two idiots again. How'd they get a bulldozer? What the hell? Let's get out. They're shooting at us, doc. I got a crush on you, baby. Do it, Chaz, do it. Push it back. Push it back. All right, I'll clear one of them, Chaz. Duck, duck. They got guns too. We got no bullets left. Are you all right, buddy? How bad is it? Are you ok? Oh my god. We're lucky we got away. I see your dossier. So you're a California girl. That's right. Your bio said you were working at Disneyland when you were recruited. What did you do there? I was one of the rides. All righty, here we go. Let's hit the bar for a cool one. Yeah. We'll see you in the morning Dietrich. We'll hit it early. This should really piss off the agency. I don't know, man. I think most of it will rub out. There's a general store a couple miles back on the road. Can you make it? Yeah, let's go. I wonder how the rest of our troops are making out. Jordan? Do you think anyone in our department knows about us? God, I hope so. Otherwise they would suck as agents. I'll get us some grub. You get us a cab. House specials, donuts, chili, ice cream, and beer. Well that pretty much covers all the food groups. Yes, sir, I'm parked right out front. I'll get ready. I'll meet you downstairs in 10 minutes. That was Dietrich. He received a top priority fax from Washington. We're meeting two interpol agents at 10:00. He says his agents have received information from the lacross satellite, information as to where the warrior has his treasure stashed. Room service please. Hey, I'm going to grab some breakfast and call fu to pick me up. We'll meet you at the office this afternoon. Here's the fax, sir. Ah, lacross satellite, I'm always amazed the amount of information that can be gathered by a satellite 200 miles up in the sky. We're to meet the interpol representatives at that lake site. It's about a 30 minute drive from here. This is fu. Fu, I'm at the holidome. Pick me up in half an hour. I'll be waiting out front. I assume you will have much to tell me, little butterfly. Your body's like a temple. You must have used it to exiract an enormous amount of information from Mr. Jordan son. I didn't get Jack from him. All we did was hump our brains out. You have a way with words, little flower. I shall be there in 30 minutes. I got to haul ass. Room service. You fellas can set that down right there. Today's special, waffles a la beretta. And you better make that to go. Thanks a lot. We leave tonight on my private jet for south America. This is my day, Ron, the day of the warrior. First, I'll kill these two with my bare hands. I can feel the power. Then I'll leave this wretched country taking riches beyond my wildest dreams. The world is my oyster. Ron, take these two to lake cabin and pack up everything. Prepare them to fight. Here's a gift for you. Thanks. When fu left to get Willow he said he'd be right back. That was over two hours ago. Nobody's heard from Jordan or Dietrich. The lake cabin, it's the only lead we have. Let's go. Well, this is it. According to the map, this is where we're supposed to meet them. You know what? Please open the case. This 1s a bomb. It's very simple. We give Mr. hard drive the case. We get back in the car. He drives away. I press the button. He blows up. I like it, Manuel. You think of everything. So we burn up a few dollars with the explosion. It costs money to stay in business. It'll be money well spent. We've got to find their cabin. It's somewhere on this lake. The homing device signals we planted only carry five miles, doc. We need to get lucky. Here it is, Mr. Hard drive, I believe. Open it. $1 million in unmarked bills. This should keep you in style for the rest of your life. Money goes far in certain parts of Europe if you don't overdo it. This is only a fraction of what I helped the warrior unmask. If I decide to overdo it, tell him I'll be back for more. I'll do that. The back roads are tough. The camps about 100 yards this way. Come on. We're going to get killed. I've told you a thousand times, you've got to think positive. I'm positive we're going to get killed. Soam I? It's the bug on Jordan's car. Oh my god. What happened to you? He's lucky to be alive.
