The Constructor of the First Rocketplane Academician P. I. Sedych. How many times have I to tell you - no filming until I'm back from the Moon. It's bad to be so bothersome. I sympathize with you- popularity is awfully tiring! I'm an inventor too! My invention - the catapult with telescopic aim - former slingshot. That's amazing! Let's go, I'll show you my invention. JOSEPH STALIN. USSR 1 KLIM VOROSHILOV. USSR 2 Yeah! This is stunning! The passengers' cabin - Command Center of the Rocketplane. What a lucky man you are! You'll be the first man on the Moon.

EXPRESS TELEGRAM STUNNED BY SEDYCH'S DECISION TO FLY TO THE MOON stop STOP THE INSANE stop HAVE PROOF stop KARIN. So where is your proof? Here's the brilliant proof: At 100.000 kilometers from the Earth ...and heart rupture. But, my friend, I'm not a rabbit. You're an old man though... Until my experimental rockets give a signal from the Moon, I shan't allow you to risk your life. We can't risk the life of a man like this... We can't risk the life of a man like this... That evening the prof. Karin's rocket ♪ 128 was setting off to the Moon with a new test object aboard - a pussycat. These experiments can last forever Victor! Let's fly ourselves and open the way into Space! It began the night of the space voyage and the last preparations were under way. At the Sedych's house everyone was preparing for the voyage. Why are you packing so many things, darling? Listen to me! I can't keep quiet anymore! There's a whole conspiracy against you. Karin has been plotting with Victor to stop you flying to the Moon! Victor too? Mother always called Victor a cry-baby. But I'm here, ready to go with you anywhere you want! Comrade on Duty! Let these young astronomer through to the hangar. Prof. Sedykh. But where are you going? To the Moon. They won't even let you through to the starting area! Don't harass mom, I'll bring you a present from the Moon. That night Prof. Karin was waiting for the landing flash of the Rocket ♪ 128 Get ready - just a few minutes to go! Comrade on Duty! Let these young astronomer through to the hangar. Prof. Sedykh. JOSEPH STALIN The Lift-off Brigade. Take your places! The rocket ♪ 128 has disappeared! Pavel Ivanovitch! We won't let you fly away...! Crew! Get ready! Marina! I suggest you to fly with me to the Moon. To the Moon?! I'M READY!! Pasha... you're insane... STOP! Andriusha! I'll fly! My old man is going to fly to the Moon. The temperature there is -270 degrees, but he's forgotten his warm felt boots! Forward - INTO SPACE! And May Live the Youth!!! Do what you want with me but I'm not leaving. Before the start the Crew immersed themselves in special baths to avoid the fatal jolts from the blast-off. At the 5th minute of the flight, at 80 km from Earth, Academician Sedych switched off the rocket engines and at that very moment the austronauts became weightless. Be careful! Mind you're weightless! Velocity. Kilometers. Bravely! What a wonderful feeling it is! I want to fly to you but fly back... What a world without weight! Let's open the portholes and start observing. Aim more accurately!! There it is - Our Moon! The Lunar landing time was approaching. Astronomers on Earth were waiting for a flash from the rocketplane as agreed. The Moon was approaching. Get into the baths! Quick to the porthole! The Moon!! On 9th August, dressed in impenetrable costumes, supplied with oxygen apparatus, the Austronauts went out onto the airless Moon surface. Radio equipment gave the voyagers the possibility to communicate with each other. Where's the Earth? We landed on that side of the Moon which can never be seen from the Earth. What's there to think about? Let's start the rocket and fly over to the opposite side. But the oxygen supply is only enough for the way back. I won't risk it. Make all the preparations for the signal flash and I'll go to explore. You know - I haven't slept for 48 hours. Then eat something and go to bed quickly. It's hard - going out there... But then I've seen the Earth! Pavel Ivanovitch! It seems the oxygen tank is damaged. An unexpected accident - our return is under threat. We have to tell Earth that we have reached the Moon. Let's send the signal straight away! Let the kid sleep - this journey is beyond his strenght. Marinochka, I haven't slept so well in ages! An unexpected accident - our return is under threat. Comrades! We've had an accident on board but you conceal it from me!? You're sending the signal but didn't took me!! What? Am I a small boy?! The Earth!! But where is Pavel Ivanovitch? Pavel Ivanovitch!! Pavel Ivanovitch!! Cheer up, Marinka! The expedition must go on! Quick to the telescopes... The Moon!! USSR Let's search - quickly! Pavel lvanovitch!! Pavel lvanovitch!! What are the flashes over there? Pavel lvanovitch! The rocket ♪ 128 is signaling. It means the pussycat is alive! Pavel lvanovitch! Radio. Marinka! His radio! He is near. Look - these are my sling shott's balls. We've signaled to the Earth! And we've got an answer!! What is this white stuff? Is it snow?! No - these are frozen remains of the Moon's atmosphere! They'll replace our lost oxygen!! You collect the atmosphere and I'll recover the pussycat. Many days have passed since the signal from the Moon. The rocketplane hasn't returned. The decision has been made to send a second interplanetary giant on a voyage... The first austronauts have paved the way into Space... They reached the Moon but some obstacle don't allow them to come back home. We'll reach the Moon and all return together! Give these flowers to Andriusha! Look, a rocket is landing with parachutes! It's them!!! Greetings to the fearless Andryushka. And where is the 4th passenger? The pussycat! Alive!! So professor Karin, as you see the Moon has been reached and our hearts still intact.
