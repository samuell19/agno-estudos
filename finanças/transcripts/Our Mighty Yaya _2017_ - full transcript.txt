--== McEphie ==-- [upbeat music playing] -[man 1] Hey, be careful. -[man 2] Okay. [Virgie] Love! Are you hungry? Let's eat. [Oca] Hand it over. [Virgie] Here. Come on. Let's eat. [Oca] You're right on time. Phew. [Virgie] Let's eat. Gie, did you borrow some money? We still need 5,000 pesos, Oca. Love, can't we just work instead? What kind of job will you get? Think about it. My mom's too old. And who will take care of our child if you leave? [Virgie] Sis, what about my husband and son? [sister] And what about your debt? The hospitalization of your mother-in-law? You know... every year, your mother-in-law is on the verge of death. How about Jonel's education? Don't you want him to go to college? I'll think about it, Sis. Sis, they are offering a salary of 8,000 pesos a month. And that's just a starting salary. And you will also have a meal allowance if necessary. You will also have a 13-hour-check bonus. You will also have a 14th check as a Christmas gift. That's why my sister Tessie took home about 36,000 pesos last Christmas. Thirty-six thousand only for being a nanny? It's not so bad. Where will you earn that over here? -Good afternoon, my godmother! -Hey! -Mom. -My child. -Have a snack. We have rice cakes. -Okay, I'll change my clothes first. -Then we'll have dinner. -[Virgie mutters] Sis! What now? Do you want your son to go to college or not? [Oca] If Tessie's job has good benefits, then why is she leaving? It's because Tessie is getting married. They're planning on staying in Cagayan de Oro after the wedding. That's why they need a new nanny. Jonel, what is it? Dad, I need to pay for something at our school. -[scoffs] What is it again? -[clicks tongue] How much is it? It's 200 pesos for our project. Two hundred... Oh, my. Give me a minute. Here it is. -Here are the 200 pesos you need. -Thank you. Oca. Look at this. -Do you understand now? -[somber music playing] [Virgie] Jonel. Please study hard. And don't give your dad a hard time. Yes, Mom. -[both sniffling] -I won't stay there too long. -I will come back as soon as I can. -[Jonel sniffles] [Virgie] Love... Love, do not cry. You're ugly when you cry, hmm? You're uglier when you cry. That's why we shouldn't cry. We're both ugly when we cry. Love. -Love, take care. -Hand it to me. Give it to me. Please take care. -Love... -[sister] Let's go, Sis! -[engine starting] -Mom... [melancholy music playing] Sis. I'm not going to cry. [upbeat music playing] Where am I? Where is she? Are you Virginia Redoble? -Yes! -Are you sure? Yes, that's me! I am Nelson. I was asked to pick you up. Ah! Really? Let's go. -Hey, where are you going? -To the parking lot. -It's where the van is! -Ai! [lively music playing] Wow! What a huge house! Can you please help me with my big luggage? [Nelson] Okay. -I only see this on television. -[Florence] Bring her things inside. Hello! Are you the new nanny? -Yes, I am Gigi. What's your name? -I am Florence. [Bibing] Is she here yet? Is she here yet? My God, Nelson! Why are you late? Ms. Bibing, her bus was late. Why didn't you text me? I've been texting you but got no reply! -My phone has no credit. -You're always like that! Why do you have a cellphone if you won't buy credit? Ah! -You! -[exclaims] [lively music playing] -[Bibing] Florence. -Yes? Can you tell her... What's your name again? It's Virgie. -Guide her to the servant's quarters. -Yes, yes, yes. -Move faster! -Yes, yes, yes! Ma'am Monique and the children have been waiting for you! -Nelson! -[Nelson] What? Miss? Is she the new nanny? Hmm. She's Vangie. It's Virgie. Virgie. Virgie, Vangie, they're all the same! [Rosita] How are you related to Tessie? She is from the same province as my husband. Oh. They came from the same province? You're married? -Yes. -What? Just one. -Oh. -Wait, wait, wait. Did Tessie tell Miss Monique that you're married? Because we don't accept helpers here that are married. Especially those with kids! [kids in English] Shoot her! Shoot her! Yes! [kids screaming] Kevin! Stop that! -But she's the evil enemy! -Evil enemy? I'm not the enemy! I am the maid here! I am not the enemy! And why are you guys shouting? Kevin, Peachy, didn't I tell you it's unruly to act like that? -[huffs] -[Monique] Jocelyn. -Ma'am. -Oh, my God, Jocelyn. -[in Tagalog] What happened to you? -It's the kids. They said I'm the enemy. Chased me and stuck this on me. [sighs] [chuckles] [in English] What's this? [in Taglish] Uh, she's the new nanny, recommended by Tessie. [in English] Good afternoon, ma'am. [in Tagalog] Hello, kids! [in English] Man! This one's really ugly. Kevin, don't talk to your nanny like that. It's true, Auntie, she is ugly. Yes, I know that she's ugly, but it's rude to talk to people like that. You don't tell them that they are ugly even if they really are. It's bad manners. Remember that, okay? [laughing] [in Tagalog] What is she saying? Sis, they said that you are ugly. [in English] So there will be days when I spend most of my time outside the house, because I am busy, and I work a lot, so I really can't attend to all the needs of Tonichi's children. That is why I greatly rely on the competence of the nanny to take care of the daily needs of Kevin and Peachy. Do you understand English or should I translate into Tagalog? [stammers] Ma'am, I understand English, but slow-slow. Slow. Slow. What's "slow-slow"? I talk English slow-slow. [in Tagalog] Slowly. [in Taglish] Okay, this is Aunt Bibing. She's in charge and she's always been in charge, ever since before I married Tonichi. Hi, Auntie! I came from Sir Tonichi's parents. Yeah. Do you have any questions, Vangie? Ma'am, it's Virgie. Virgie. I thought your name was Vangie. You said her name was Vangie! You told me your name was Vangie! No! it's Virgie. I'm Virgie Casugay Redoble. I am a Virgie, I am not a Vangie. I'm a Virgie. And I am, uh... Evidence. What I want is just simple. Make sure they are clean, never hungry, make sure they get what they want. Are you following me? Yes, ma'am. Yes ma'am. I follow. I follow. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. They have to be good children. -All right? -Yes, yes. So I don't like messy, noisy, naughty. I don't want them mischievous in this house. -All right? -Yes, yes. You can discipline them, but make sure it's in a nice way. Are you still with me? Huh? With you, ma'am. With you. [in English] As much as possible, make sure that you do not talk to them in any language but English. [in Tagalog] Don't talk to them in any other language but English. [in English] Not until they're 15 years old. -[in Tagalog] Will be a while. -[in English] What did you say? -[in Taglish] Yes. Yes, ma'am, English. -Ma'am. Do you know that Vangie already has a family? Is that so? Yes, ma'am. My husband's taking care of my son. Anyway, he is old enough. Oh, no. I'm really unsure about this. We've had one like you before. She also had a husband and a child, and now what? Always asking for advance payment. Usually, the reason was her husband is sick or for her child's tuition fee. Or she has to claim back their carabao or their boat! [Virgie] We don't have a boat. My husband doesn't know how to swim. That's why we don't have a boat. [Jocelyn] Kevin. Peachy. Meet your new nanny! [cheering] Okay, she's ugly and she stinks. Hi! I'm your new nanny. No, you are not. We already have a nanny. That is nanny Tessie. Get her out of here. I don't like your smell. [Marla] Jocelyn, can you ask Florence about the shorts and pants that I asked her to iron? I'm going to fetch my friends in an hour. Okay, ma'am. Ma'am, it's... Good afternoon. Is she the new nanny? Yes, ma'am. Please call Florence. I'll just freshen up. All right. Who's that? Ma'am Marla, eldest daughter of Sir Tonichi. That one's the real snob. Them? They don't even come close. Hey. Mmm. Here. What are these, Auntie? Ma'am asked me to give it to you. It's your uniform. Tomorrow I will buy you more. This is from the previous nanny. It hasn't been used yet, and I think it will fit you. And why? Is there any problem? Uh-uh. It has kids' drawings, Auntie. So, do you have a problem with it? Nothing. [chuckles] Do you know what that is? It is alum. You rub it on your armpits. Good afternoon, sir. Where's Ma'am Monique? She's upstairs. She just got home. Okay, then. Hi! Where have you been? I was actually with Mitch and Michael at their new condo, and the interior designer showed us the designs. -Oh, that's good. -Yeah. Have you guys eaten? No, we waited for you, but Marla's not here yet. She's not here? [Tonichi] What's that? She just went out with asking permission? Who picked her up? I don't know. I was in the kitchen cooking. Your eldest just left. Ton, why don't we eat first? I mean, I'm sure she's okay. She's with her classmates, her friends. Well, next time, talk to her. Don't you think I try to do that, Ton? But she doesn't listen to me. Maybe she'll listen to you. You are her father, after all. Hi, sir. Hi, ma'am. Good evening! Ton, this is... What's your name again? Sorry. It's Virgie. Virgie. Virgie? Are you the one sent by Tessie to take care of the two children? Yes, yes! I am the one. Peachy, do you like your new nanny? Hi! Not really. Not really? How come? She's ugly and funny. Peachy, we don't talk like that about our nannies, okay? We discussed this already, right? [scoffs] We didn't have a chance to meet the mother of the children. But Auntie Bibing, Auntie Rosita, and Auntie Tessie have met the mother of the children. Because they've been here for quite some time. Auntie Tessie always tells us that Ma'am Marilen was really good to them. But unfortunately, she died early. Oh, my. The poor kids. They lost their mother too early. That's why they became close to their previous nanny. -For sure. -Ah, that's why... So, if Tessie really loves the kids, why did she leave? Virgie, it's because she cannot bear sir's new wife. -Ah. -[upbeat music playing] As Auntie Tessie said, Ma'am acts like she was born rich. Also, Sir Tonichi's family says that Ma'am Monique forced their marriage. Florence, it's not nice to talk that way about her. Auntie Bibing might hear you. [both] Huh? Even Auntie Bibing and Auntie Rosita say bad things about Ma'am Monique! She's fake. It seems to me that Ma'am Monique is kind. [both scoff] It seems that Sir Tonichi is taking care of her. -[scoffs] -Why are you always saying that? -[both chuckle] -What do you mean by that? It's for you to find out! -[exclaims] Give it a little more time. -[muttering] It seems that the children are good. They're a little naughty just because they are kids. Virgie, it's not that I'm trying to scare you, but take this as a warning. Those children are monsters. Come on. It seems like you treat them like murderers. They were close to killing their previous nanny! Oh, yes. Where did you put your pencil? Under the mattress. Tss. You're getting on my nerves! Why is it soft? [laughter] Hey! [screams] [Bibing] Wait a minute! Can't you wait for sir to arrive? No! I don't like it anymore! I can't take it anymore! [shouting] I'll go ahead. I'll show myself out. The worst thing happened to Auntie Violy. Of course, Auntie Violy is already old. She cannot take care of the kids. What happened to Auntie Violy? -Nana! Peachy's old bicycle. -[Violy] Where are we going? Why old bicycle? You have a new one. Just get it for me, okay? Where? -There! -[grunts] [all screaming] [woman] Poor Auntie Violy! Oh, my God! What happened? I think she's fine. She's still alive. [exclaims] [stifling laughter] Kids? Did she really die? Not really. She doesn't want to come back anymore. Since Auntie Tessie left, no nanny lasted because of the kids. So, good luck, Virgie! We will pray for you. Thank you! -Hey, thank you so much! -Of course. That's why we're friends. [gentle music playing] Marla, why are you so afraid of your father seeing us? Steven, let's not have any complications in our lives, please. Look, when you introduce me to your dad, I'm sure... [chuckles] Please! I'll introduce you to my dad? Really? How about Sunday afternoon? -Are you coming to Alabang? -Steven, we'll see. -Okay? -Come with us. -My Dad's here. He might see you. -Please come with us. -I love you. -I love you. Wait. -I'll go ahead. Take care. -[chuckles] -[Marla] Bye! -[Steven] Bye! Good evening, ma'am. What are you doing here? -It's because I'm going to throw-- -Did you see who I was with? No, because you were in the car. Come here. I'll talk to you. -You didn't see anything, okay? -Mmm-mmm. If anybody asks, you say nothing. Even Auntie Bibing. You didn't see anything. Understand? Yes. And don't ever tell my dad and his girl about this. You wouldn't want me as your enemy! Get it? Get it. Go on now. [bright music playing] It's too cold in here! I think I will get pneumonia in here. Hey! Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. Peachy. Wake up. Wake up. [exclaims] What the... [Bibing] As I told you before, cook breakfast early! You're too slow! You just have to push it like this! -Yes, Bu. -Come on! I'll have a heart attack because of you guys! Peachy! Faster. You're already late! Nanny, I don't understand you! [in English] Me also. Just make it fast! Kevin! Wake up! [stammers] [in Taglish] Just get up there. It's really hard for me! Virgie, hurry up. The kids might be late. Okay. Will be right there. Do you know when nanny Tessie is coming back? I don't know. -[in Tagalog] Where did she go? -Uh... What did you say? Huh? -You know how to speak Tagalog? -Shh. Don't tell that to our stepmom. She'll get mad. Oh, okay. I will tell Auntie Monique that you were talking to her in Tagalog. You, too! You can speak Tagalog! Oh! I find it so hard to speak English, and now I find out you know how to speak Tagalog! -Come. I will help you. -No, no need. [jolly music plays] [in English] Okay, whatever. [in Taglish] Yeah, you took a bath, but your English is still bad. Okay, whatever! Better luck next time! You eat. Eat. Peachy, stop playing with your food. Why is it oatmeal again? It's good for you. It has fiber and-- Maybe she's tired of oatmeal. Peachy, what do you want to eat? I want... cornflakes, Daddy! Cornflakes? -Thank you. -Nanny, can you give her cornflakes? Huh? Cornflakes. Can you please get her cornflakes? Yes, ma'am. I'll just get this. Peachy, wait for your cornflakes. [Virgie] What are cornflakes? Do you like your food? Rosita, Peachy wants to have cornflakes. And? Get them. In that container. What container? Come on. I think you have eyes, shoulders, and a head. I know you know how to read. It's there! [muttering] [lively music playing] Excuse me. Mina, what are cornflakes? Here it is. Oh. It's rice flakes. So that's the English term for this. This is not rice flakes, it's cornflakes. I'll get it done. Peachy. [in English] She wants to eat her cornflakes. [in Tagalog] Pardon? [in English] Peachy wants to eat her cornflakes. The cornflakes are... The cornflakes are... How can she eat her cornflakes? "How"? -The cornflakes... -Peachy, here you go. Here's the milk. [in Taglish] Ah, that is how it's done. [chuckles] Ma'am, sir, sorry. I'm not familiar with that. It's okay, Virgie. But, sir, you know, it's like ginumis. Daddy, what's ginumis? It's something the natives eat. [Virgie] Faster, kids. Faster. Speak English, nanny. Faster! Faster! You mean "hurry up." Here, you'll be the nanny. It seems you like to be one! [mutters] -Bye. -[Virgie in English] Faster! Open! [in Taglish] Can you open, please? Open. Florence. Florence. Put these in the washing machine together with the children's used clothes. Washing machine. Florence. Washing... [upbeat music playing] [stammers] Florence! How will I wash the clothes? [screams] Virgie! Virgie! Wait! Virgie... Hey! Why are you hand washing the clothes in there when we have a washing machine? I really like the stream here. And the one you mentioned, I am afraid of that. The washing machine? Yes, that's the one. -[whining] -[Virgie] I was thinking it might explode. [whining] No, it won't explode! It won't? Damn you! Hi, Auntie! Yeah, it was okay. Yeah, and then, oh, my gosh, the training was so intense, -my feet hurt. I was exhausted! [laughing] -Yeah, it was so tiring, right? I really don't know. I don't know what to do. Mitch, you know that my parents split up when I was, what, five years old? So I was taught independence out of necessity. I don't know anything about being a mother. -And besides-- -[chuckles] I know you don't like kids. Hey, I like children, okay? Yeah, Mons. You like children. -[giggles] -[sighs] Okay. I like them when they're babies, and when they're cute, but not when they're noisy, and sluggish-- Okay, let me speak. Okay, go. You knew that Tonichi Sevilla has three kids, and you knew that the kids are a package deal from his late wife. And you said you could handle it. I thought I could. Mons, just give it time. The kids are adjusting to you. Hey, I'm not stupid, Mitch, okay? I know they are trying to be nice and polite, but I know that they don't like me. [laughing] I don't want this to have to affect their relationship with their father. Okay. May I speak again? Okay. If he has to choose between you, the second wife, and the three children, who would Antonio Sevilla choose? I don't know! Okay. Can you help me? That's why we're talking right now! I know you can do it. It's simple. Just try harder. I know you can do it. Go drink some tea. -Look, I'm turning into a brat again. -It's okay! [woman 1 chuckles] Kevin and Peachy have a new victim! Poor thing. -[woman 2] I know. -[both giggling] Hello. Are you new here? -Yes. -Shall we? [giggling] Are you the one taking care of Peachy? -You know her? -Of course! Peachy's brother is Kevin, right? Yes. She's classmates with the ones I'm taking care of. So where's Jocelyn? She's at the house. She's actually just a substitute. -I'm the new nanny. -[bell rings] -[woman 1] Oh, they're here! -[woman 2] Where are they? [Virgie] Peachy? [kids clamoring] Peachy, come here! [woman 2] Oh, my God, Adonis, you smell like paksiw! [Virgie] Go, eat your sandwich. I don't want to eat this. I want chocolates! Where can we get chocolates? I'm telling you I want chocolates! Auntie Bibing told me not to let you eat chocolates! I don't want a sandwich! -Here, take some. -No, they're for him. It's okay. I have plenty of chocolates here. His parents came from abroad and bought a lot. Okay. I'll take two. Mmm! You took so many chocolates! Go. Thank her. Thank you! -You're welcome! -Let's go! -[kids clamoring] -Peachy! Don't run around! I told you not to allow Peachy to eat chocolates! Why did you still let her? Ma'am, she wanted some because she was hungry. If she was hungry, then why didn't you give her the sandwich? She really wanted chocolates. Ugh! Where in the world did you get those chocolates? Did you give her the chocolates? No! All the chocolates are in your room's fridge. [angrily] Virgie, let this be a warning. You follow the rules. You don't give the kids everything they want. That's not good. You get me? -I get you, ma'am. -Hmm? I do. [lively music playing] -[grunts angrily] -[stammers nervously] She's acting as if she's the real mother! Tonichi just met her someplace! Please be quiet. She might hear you! [angrily] Let her hear it! [bright music playing] [Virgie] Have you been with them for a while? [Jocelyn] About two years. That's why we're already so close. I'm so happy! Lodjie has finally married Tessie after coming back from Riyadh. -They're now living in Cagayan de Oro. -[Virgie] Really? Yes. I hope I'll be as lucky as Tessie. Imagine. She's 37, yet she has met a stable man. Really? -How about you? Do you have a boyfriend? -None! I prioritize my career. -There are eight children in my family. -That's a lot! I'm the fifth one. I need to earn well for the education of my younger siblings. We're on the same page. When my youngest sibling graduates, I'll get a boyfriend. -[tittering] -Really? A handsome one like Piolo Pascual or Alden Richards! [giggles] They're so handsome! Then he'll marry me and make beautiful babies! Jocelyn, giving birth is not as easy as farting. I know I can do it. I'll do everything as long as the baby's cute. What if it's not? You'll put the baby back in your womb? [laughter] Kevin, go do your homework. Stop using your tablet. What are you doing there? Monitoring your time so you'll do your homework. Okay, okay, I'll do my homework. [whispers] You're crazy! What does this word mean? [mispronouncing] Ren-dez-vous. -Rendezvous? What does that mean? -I don't know. I don't know. Stop reading already. That might be a bad word. Peachy, why ask her? Just Google it! What's Google? -Don't you know what Google is? -Is it something you put in your hair? [laughter] -You're so funny! -She's not funny. She's stupid! Hey! I'm not stupid. I'm resourceful! What's that? Google it! [Monique] Marla, please don't turn your back on me when I'm talking to you! What's your problem? Just stay here, okay? You cannot leave this house without asking for permission! From you? Why? Why would I ask permission to you? You're just my dad's wife. You're not my mom. -[melancholy music playing] -[sighs] I cannot be their mother because they don't want me to be their mother. I'm not asking you to replace Marilen. If you can't be a mother to my children, at least try to be their friend. Reach out to them. You know you just have to show them that you can be trusted. And you can be a friend to them. Okay. [gentle music playing] -Wait. -Tag me in the photos too. How can I tag you if you don't have an account? Nanny, let's play. We're short of players. I don't want to. I don't know how. -[kids clamoring] -Please. Just for a little while. I don't know how to play that. Jocelyn, go play with him. I don't want to. I'm on my period. It seems like it has already lasted for a month! Go. Play with the kid. Please? I'll play with you as long as these two play also. -[kids cheering] -[Jocelyn shrieking] [kid] Faster! [kid laughing] You hurt me! -Sorry. Did it hurt? -No! I'm not hurt. [kid] Yeah! [screaming and cheering] [laughing] [screams] -[crying] -[woman mutters] Oh, my God! The game wasn't supposed to be played like that. -Hooray! -Yeah! [lively music playing] This one or this one? [grunts] [kid laughing] [Virgie] Hey, stop it! Tickle tickle! -[Virgie muttering] -[laughter] Don't go away. We'll be right back. Do your job well! -[kid screams] -Don't run down the stairs! -[imitating fanfare] -[screams] -[screaming] -[exclaims] Ma'am, are you okay? -[light music plays] -[moans] -[Virgie] Hey, hey! Wait for me! -[kids clamoring] [Kevin] Geronimo! Ai! Kevin! Stop that. -What were you telling me again? -[woman] He was caught! -[Kevin screaming] -They even had a hard time. -How were they busted? -They even called the police! Oh! Don't... don't... hear. -This is only for big people. -Big, big. No. Big. -Mix it like that. -Do we need more eggs? [sighs] We're from Guimaras, but I'm from Bulacan and married an Ilonggo. [woman] What are you doing to him? -[Virgie] Hey! -He fought him! -He's bigger than him! -You don't do that to him! What do you want to do? Want some of these? Good evening. Have the kids eaten already? [Bibing] Yes. Earlier. Are they sleeping already? They're in the family room playing with their nanny. Hon, it's past nine o'clock. Ah, it's okay. It's Friday, anyway. Okay. [cheering] -Kevin, it's your turn. -Go on. We should be thankful. They get along with their nanny. [Kevin] Got it! Why? Do you a have a problem with her? Don't you like Virgie? She's okay. Ton... I mean it. She's okay. [Kevin] Yay! I did it! [Peachy] Come on! [cheering] [Virgie] Your turn, Kevin! -Here it comes! -Here it comes! [upbeat music playing] [all screaming] -Kids, let's enjoy it! -[kids] Yay! [kids screaming] [Virgie] Kevin! Peachy! [Kevin] So we're not allowed in the roller skaters. [woman] Remember. Your mom told you that you can't ride an attraction without a guardian. So who will we go with? Hmm. I can't go. I get dizzy a lot. So who will we ride with? [jolly music playing] Please. [sighs] At this age... I can't go. -[upbeat music playing] -[screaming] Are you all right? After everything that happened, you ask me that? I want to ride the Rio Grande. I'm so exhausted. Can we do it later? Please? [kids screaming] Yay! Yay! [screaming and laughing] [Virgie exclaiming] Don't! [muttering] -[Virgie] Can we go home yet? -Where are those kids? I don't know. They don't get tired. [sighs] Can you go with us? Aren't you getting tired? Please? Where? There! Look! [kids screaming] -[exclaims] -[Peachy] Yes. [lively music playing] Nanny, it's your son! -My son! -[all exclaiming] Hi! Mom, how are you? -I'm good. It's Marla, Kevin, and Peachy. -Hi! -[Virgie] How are you? I miss you so much. -[Marla] How are you? [Virgie continues indistinctly] [in English] "The end." One more, please! [in Tagalog] I've been reading again and again. I'm already tired of speaking in English. This is the last. Please. -[in Taglish] Promise me this is the last. -Promise! -[Kevin] Okay. -Okay. Okay. Let's read a new one. "Hansel and--" I know that name! I've already read that! I like the story. Go ahead! Read or no read? Read. I've already forgotten where I started. Where did we start again? The introduction of Hansel and Gretel. Okay. "Hansel and Gretel were brother and sister." "Their mother died when they were young." "And their father married another woman." Hmm. This story seems familiar. "But the woman that their father married did not like Hansel and Gretel." Okay. Let's look for another story. -Please continue. -There are a lot of other stories. Just continue! "So the stepmother told the father..." Dad will take us to the forest and let us get lost? So we could never get back home. So what do we do? Don't worry. I have a plan. What's the plan? "What the father and stepmother did not know was Hansel heard the plans." Daddy, I'm hungry. Can you get me some bread before we go? Okay, I'll get you some. Why did you ask for bread? Never mind. I have a plan. "This time, Hansel used the bread to mark the way back to their home." Isn't it really stupid to leave breadcrumbs? I don't know. I'm just reading the story. "So the father brought Hansel and Gretel to the woods so that they can be lost." "But this time, something went wrong." [Peachy as Gretel] It is because you used breadcrumbs as a marker on our path! You have not anticipated that this is a forest, which means there are many birds here, so the birds ate your markers!` Well, if you are so smart, why don't you come up with a plan? Whatever! Just tell me! How will we go home now? [sniffing] Gretel, do you smell that? It smells like... cookies! It's like somebody's baking cookies! But... here in the forest? Come, I smell the cookies in that direction. Come! [lively music playing] There! That's where the smell is coming from! A cottage? Would anybody live here in the middle of the forest? Maybe... that's where the delicious smell is coming from. Come! [both giggling] [both] Yes! Oh, my God! As in, "Oh, my God!" Gretel, these are real! Look. And I am so hungry because you scattered the bread in the forest. Come. I think there is much more food inside. Let's go inside. [Virgie] "Imagine, when the two children went inside, they saw so many candies, cookies, and chocolates!" [Peachy] So they ate? [Virgie]"They didn't just eat, they voraciously ate as their hearts desired." [giggling] So what happened next? Wait. [engine roaring] [coughing] My broom's damaged. [exclaims] What happened to my house? It's a mess! I cleaned this before I went out to the forest. What happened? What happened to my house? Why are there so many scraps? What happened? Damn this contractor! I told them to make me a house that's good to live in. Not a house built with biscuits and sugar! That's why it's infested with ants! -Damn! -Excuse me. -Good evening. -We are the ones... Huh? Who are you? Who are you? My brother and I just wanted to apologize. Is that it? Where are you? We are here. Uh... There and then? It was not the ants who ate your house. Right! If not ants, then it's the rats. It's not them. Then what? We are the ones. You! And you are proud of it? You fools! We're actually not proud of it. There's so much food on the table but you chose that? My house? We didn't know. [shouting] You didn't know that my house is food? There's so much food in here, so why did you eat my house? It's because we were hungry! Hungry? You were hungry and you chose to eat my house! Here! Get ready, because I will eat you two! It did not say that! Let me see that! No, this is a different version. What happened next? Uh... You will not escape me! Please! We want to go home! What are you saying? No! I will eat you two! No! So how did the story end? Nanny, what happened to the witch? [stammers] They lived happily ever after! No! Please don't! Please, no! [kids] Die, witch, die! Die! Die! Die! [Virgie] Why is the ending like this? No! There will be no killings. Let's just sleep. -No! -Hey! -Here's your juice, ma'am. -Thank you. [Monique] Kevin! Peachy! Auntie has something for you. Do you like it? Thank you, Auntie! Do you want me to help you play with your toys? Uh... later, Auntie. We're busy. Okay, so I guess just tell me when you're not busy and then we can play with your new toys. Okay? My God. What was that? [mocking] You like your new toy, honeybunch? [imitates laughing] [Monique] And I feel like they have their own world. -Mmm-hmm. -And they've locked me out of that. I feel like Tonichi thinks it's my fault. That I don't care about his children. And I've tried what everyone tells me. I tried to reach out. And? How are you? Are you talking to me? Yes. How are you? I'm fine. How was school? It's okay. Uh, can you remind Auntie to get my laundry tomorrow? -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you. Mons, you said it yourself. You know Marla was close to her mom. [sighs] Hey, it's not like I'm asking her to come up to me and kiss me and hug me every time that she sees me. Mitch, all I want is some respect. How about the little kids? Nanny, can you get the kids ready? We're leaving. -Okay, ma'am. -Where are we going? We're going to the mall. Auntie Monique has decided to spend the whole day with you. -Go, nanny. Get them dressed. -Okay, ma'am. We'll be ready by 11:00. Oh, you're not included. Why, ma'am? This is a family trip. Just stay here in the house. It's a family thing. So what happened? How did that go? Did you enjoy it? What happened? [upbeat music playing] -[screaming and laughing] -[Peachy] Wait! [Monique] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Kevin! Peachy! Oh, my God. My shoes will break. Oh, my God! Kevin! Kevin. Oh, my God! Kevin, I've been looking everywhere for you. Buy this. [stammers] Um... -Where's your sister? -Buy this! Kevin, where is your sister? -[loud voice] Buy this! -[loud voice] Where is your sister? I told you to watch over your sister! I thought she was just around. English, please. [in English] I thought she was beside me. [in Taglish] Madam, can you give us a description of the missing kid? -She's small. -Of course, she's small. She's a kid. Uh, what I mean is, uh... Auntie, she's there! Oh, my God. Peachy, you're okay! Thank goodness, you're okay! You left me alone! [gentle music playing] [in English] Peachy, English. [in Taglish] I don't want to! You left me alone in the store! Good afternoon, ma'am! How was the trip? Take them to bathe. I need to rest. What happened? [both] Nanny. So what did Tonichi say after he found out you almost lost Peachy at the mall? Nothing. But I'm sure she told her dad about it. [sighs] Tell me, Mitch. Aren't my efforts enough? I mean, I am really trying. You're talking serious stuff here, aren't you? -What is it? -[Mitch] Nothing. Is everything okay? Yeah? Yeah, we're just talking about the weather, right? Yes. It's so hot now, right? Marla, I saw this in the TV room. It's been ringing. -That's my sister's boyfriend calling. -Shut up, Kevin! Go. Call him back. Just be discreet. Your Aunt Monique's there. Okay, nanny. I love you so much! -I love you. Thank you! -[Virgie] Fine. Fine. -Can you just leave, Kevin? -[Peachy giggling] [Marla] My God. So Mitch is asking if we want to come. With the kids? No. Just the both of us. Well, after Easter, it's the kids' vacation. -Thank you. -So who do we leave them with? Ton, that's why they have a nanny, remember? You're saying we're going to leave them nine days with the maids and Nanny? Yeah. -What is it? -I'm telling you, they're fighting every day! -[Kevin] Go! -[boy] Okay! -Look at how you eat. -Nanny! -Kevin escaped! -Huh? -[Virgie] Kevin! Kevin! -[energetic music playing] [all clamoring] -[Virgie] Kevin escaped from us! -[clamoring continues] [Virgie] Hey! Come back! Kevin! Stop! [screaming] Kevin! Come back! Kevin! -Give me the bike! -No! Who are you? Just give it to me! I'll explain later! This is an emergency. Yeah! Wait! Wait! Just a sec! [Virgie] Kevin! Kevin! Kevin, come back home! [Virgie] Your dad will kill me! Come back! -[Kevin] Faster! -[Virgie] Hey! Come back home! Kevin! -[Kevin] Whoo-hoo! -Kevin! Yeah. So all the arrangements for Singapore are ready. [dramatic music playing] Can I call you back, Cathy? Kevin! Nelson, was that Kevin? [Nelson] I think so, ma'am. Oh, my God! Didn't I pay you to watch over the kids? Ma'am, I really watched over them. But I saw you on the road with Kevin, riding a bike during midday traffic. Yes, ma'am. It's like this. Peachy and I are were at the garage and then Kevin's friends came. Joseph and Kyle. And then they rode bikes out there. Then where did you get a bike? [Virgie] I grabbed it from another maid. Which maid? I don't know her, but we're friends now. Oh, my gosh! Ma'am, it's like this. The kids were too fast. I even told Kevin, "Kevin, come back! Come back!" But he didn't want to. Ma'am, I'm already 50 years old. And I don't really know how to ride a bike. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Virgie, you're not getting paid to say you're sorry. But I'm really doing my job, ma'am. If you were doing your job, then I wouldn't be seeing Kevin in the middle of the road biking! [huffs] You know what? If you can't do your job, like you said, you're already 50... just let me know, okay? [melancholy music playing] [Virgie] It's my fault, Jocelyn. How can you say it's your fault? That kid's a brat by nature. When Kevin's being a brat, only his dad can stop him. It's because he's a kid. But you know what I've been wondering? Why is Ma'am Monique so mad at me? The kind of rage she can't get out. Sis, do you know the real reason why Tessie left, even if it was hard for her to leave the kids? What is it? Because the kids were following Tessie rather than their stepmom. So, remember, she can feel you're already getting closer to the kids. So what? They're my responsibility. You know what I mean. I think my masters are going to separate. Really? Why? Did they fight again last night? Correct. They're more dramatic than television shows! And there's even extra drama! They're throwing plates! -Yeah! -[phone rings] They're unbelievable! Kevin, why did you call? Nanny, I'm in the clinic. I'm sick. Huh? Sick? Why are you sick? -They said I have to go home. -Virgie? -Wait. Okay. -[woman exclaims] I'll see you there at the clinic. I'll call your Aunt Monique first. We'll tell her to pick us up. Stay there. Don't get... Don't... don't go away from the clinic. -Okay. -Okay, bye. Virgie. Hey, Virgie. -What is that about? -Hello? Ma'am Monique? [Virgie] The kid said they're telling him to go home. You didn't ask? [Virgie] Ma'am, what are we going to do? Ugh. I can't have Nelson go there because I have a meeting, and it's in Makati, and I can't cancel. Just call Tonichi and tell him to have Dave pick you up, okay? -Ma'am, it's just that-- -[angrily] Just call up my husband, okay? Gosh. Mrs. Sevilla, is everything okay? No, it's not! Okay? They won't be able to pick us up since his father is in Subic golfing. Isn't there anybody else? How many cars do you have? Two cars and two drivers. [chuckles] Us, we have five and three drivers. Okay, then, you're the rich one. You have plenty of drivers. Not really. Why don't you take a cab instead? What about the other child? Ask the school doctor to talk to her teacher so you can go home at the same time. You're right. Wait. Can you check this? Will this be enough for a cab? [gentle music playing] Is that enough? You, can you lend me some money? I'm so sorry, I don't have extra money left now. Because I sent some money to my family in the province. See, you told us you have many cars and drivers, but you don't have money. -I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. -Right. I'll go ahead. Ma'am, excuse me. She will pick up Kevin Sevilla. All right, then. -[nurse] Are you the nanny? -Yes, nurse. Okay. Excuse me, Dr. Meneses. She'll be picking up Kevin Sevilla. Where are his parents? They're kind of busy, Doc. Where is Kevin? This way, ma'am. Kevin. What happened to you? I'm sick. Sick? You're right. You're hot. Doc, why does he have a high fever? That's why we are sending him home. We're trying to contact his stepmom, but it seems she changed her number. He should be monitored because his temperature is unstable. Doc, how will I bring him home? His sister is here, and I cannot leave her in school. Okay, I will excuse her from her class so you can bring them home. -Okay? -Thank you. Oh. Kevin, come. We will go home. Can you get up? No. Nanny, where's the car? [Virgie] We don't have a car. They can't pick us up. [woman] Virgie, how will you go home? We'll take a jeep. [Peachy] Jeep? [Virgie] Why? Haven't you been on a jeepney? Never! [Virgie] Now you will be able to ride one! It's fun! [jolly music playing] [angrily] You made them ride a jeep? You know that the boy is sick, yet you made him ride public transport. While he was exposed to all these germs! Why didn't you take a cab? I don't have money. I only have 50 pesos and I don't think that is enough for a cab from Quezon City to Alabang. Why didn't you tell me? Ma'am, I called you and even told you. Monique! Can you stop being hysterical? Do you know that I can hear you from afar? Did you know that this woman made your sick son ride a jeepney home? Monique, what do you expect? Of course they will ride a jeep because you didn't send your car. I was in a meeting! Exactly! You prioritized your meeting even though you know the child is sick. Monique, I was in Subic. And you? Where were you? You were in Makati. The nanny and the kids are just in Alabang. And you didn't get them picked up? I still don't think what she did was right. [sighs] Let's talk upstairs. Tonichi, wait. I said we'll talk upstairs. [gentle music playing] The new champion! The bad-smelling nanny! [laughing] You know, sometimes even you are crazy. I still think what you did was right. [laughs] What's wrong with Kevin? He has a fever, ma'am. Sir, I think we should bring him to a doctor since his fever hasn't improved. All right. I'll just get the car. I think we should bring him to the hospital. Daddy, is Kevin going to be okay? Yes, my child. Don't worry about your brother. He's going to be fine. But tonight, you sleep in our room. Sir, I will be the one to watch over Kevin in the hospital. Okay. We need to immediately administer a series of blood tests on your son so that we can ascertain if his condition is brought about by dengue. Dengue? How can he possibly contract dengue? We make sure there are no mosquitoes in our house. He could have contracted it anywhere. There's an incubation period before the symptoms of dengue emerge. The child should be confined in the hospital so that he could be monitored and observed. What is important is we'll know what is wrong with the boy. Kevin, the doctor wants to run a series of tests. Just to make sure you're going to get better. What will they do, Dad? This will not hurt, Kevin. It's just like an insect's bite. That's nothing, Kevin. I've done that so many times. I swear it will not hurt. See? If your sister can do it, then you can do it. They're going to take a small amount of blood from you, okay? Blood? Why? We just want to make sure you're fine, Kevin. It's not going to hurt, Kevin. Okay? Nurse, what's this? That's where the blood goes after the blood sampling. This much? And this? Are you going to cook a blood stew? [Virgie] Or maybe you'll cook batchoy too. Don't worry, Kevin. Your Aunt Monique is here for you. Yaying. Yaying? -Where is Yaying? -He's calling for you. I am here. Hey! What? What's the problem? Uh... It won't hurt. Just like an ant's bite. -You can do it. -[in English] Yaya, English. Please, not now. I cannot. I cannot. [in Taglish] I know you can do it, Kevin. You can do it! It's just like a bite. A bite. Okay, Kevin, clench your fist. -[Virgie] Boxing. Just like boxing. -I'm gonna tighten it a little bit, Kevin. It's okay. It's just like boxing. That's right. You can do it. Okay, Kevin, stay still. -[Kevin] Yaying! It hurts! -[Tonichi] It's okay, Kevin. -You can do it, Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. -[Tonichi] Nanny, are you okay? [Marla] Oh, my God! Nanny! Yaying. What's wrong with me? -You have dengue. -[nurse] Good morning. Good morning, Kevin. Good morning, ma'am. The doctor's ordered to get some blood samples from Kevin. Can you get it tomorrow instead? You just got some last night. We need to analyze his platelet count so he can be cured. They got so much blood from the child last night. -So much. -Yaying. It's okay. -[light music playing] -Okay. Yaying, don't look. I won't. I will not. Have you bought yourself a ticket to Iloilo? Yes, sir. [chuckles] You're really something. Come to think of it, you've been with us for a year already. -Yes, sir. -That's quick. Just stick to our agreement, okay? Come back right away. The kids will miss you. Yes, sir. How about you, Mina? When will you go? -By the end of the month, sir. -Oh, sir. Her boyfriend, the seaman, is home and she's getting married soon. Sir, you and madame are invited. Are you sure about that? She's the one unsure? She's been texting her boyfriend all along! Admit it! Admit it! You know, sir, we're really happy for Mina! Always remember. Even if you worked here just for a while, we never treated you like a stranger. You are family to us. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -[Virgie] Oh, my! -[Jonel] Mamay! -Mamay! -My handsome son! -[joyful music playing] -My handsome kid! -How are you, my son? -I missed you! -Love! -[Oca] Yes? -Here's my gift for you. -Thank you. This one's for my handsome son. -This is so nice! -That's yours. My son's so handsome! -I missed you, my son. -Mamay. Are you going back to Manila? Yes, son. I have to. -[Jonel] Until when? -As long as I have to. Do the kids love you? Yes, son. The kids love me so much. Please leave a piece for me, okay? Oh, come on! You're crazy. Of course! You got that from your over-acting father! Why do you have to include me? [woman] I can't imagine my eldest son is turning 15! And my eldest daughter will turn 13! They're no more babies! I know! Just last week, my Paolo shaved, and you know, I cried. Hold on, Milette. Does Ria have suitors now? They should try. They have to get past me first. Hey, be cool. Hey, Anton, how about Marla? Does she have a boyfriend? Boyfriend? No way. She's too young. Come on, Ton. It's not a matter of you approving it. How old is she? 16? -Fifteen, Mitch. -Uh, she's sixteen. Turning 17 next month. -What? -Yeah. Seventeen. Wow. Wow. [woman] You're the dad and you don't know. Of course, for Ton, Marla is still his baby. Of course. Yeah, I mean she's turning 17, but she's still a bit childish. I don't know. [chuckles softly] Good thing you still have little kids. [woman chuckles] They're little kids but look at how they think. That's why I always make sure to guard their internet. That's why I always tell the nanny to watch out where the kids visit. The sites that they go to. We don't like Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram. But I mean, everybody has Facebook nowadays. Even Twitter. And I think even Kevin has an account. -Kevin has Facebook? -Yeah. -How old is Kevin? -Eleven. No wonder. That's how it is nowadays. Right? You see, that's the problem that I have. I think that our new nanny is irrelevant. Irrelevant? Like how? She's old. She's like 51, 52. -Fifty-two? That's not old. -[woman] Not bad. You know the kids. Having Kevin and Peachy are a handful. They need somebody younger. Right? Somebody that knows stuff like that. This nanny probably doesn't even know what the internet is. I still have to teach her. That's a hassle! Who told you that you can use my car without my permission? Dad, I had no choice! Nelson used the SUV because Peachy has an event at her school. Marla, you aren't even 17 years old! Plus your license is a student license, which means you cannot drive without Nelson or Dave! Whatever! My friends can drive on their own, even if they only have student licenses! Just because they do that, does not make it legal or right to do! Ton, you talk to her. [angrily] How did you even get my keys? Huh? Nanny, who keeps the keys here? That's your fault. You should've asked permission from your dad if you were going to use the car. Virgie! Tell this kid how to behave! I'm already old, but she's still fooling me around! -I also got scolded! -Uh... -But the kid doesn't know-- -What kid? This is not a kid anymore! That's why her horns are growing big because you keep on tolerating her! -But I'm not tolerating her-- -Whatever! See? Now I'm dragged into this! I only showed concern, but now I'm dragged into this! This is your fault! I told you to ask permission from your dad if you were going to use the car. You're already itching to go out! -What can you say-- -I know! What else do you want? I'm now grounded! [gentle music playing] [Marla] I was bad to my dad. I took the car without his permission. How can you not come? You already bought a dress for the prom. Hannah, as if he cares about that. Do you want Hannah to ask permission from your dad? No. He might think I'm turning his wife into a villain. So you're really not coming? Steve, I didn't say anything like that. I only said I'm grounded. But I did not say that I'm not going to the prom. Dad, please. That's JS prom. That's once in a lifetime. Marla, can we talk about this later? We're going to have dinner first. Yeah, that's why you should understand! You always go to parties with your friends! Marla, don't talk back to your aunt like that. But, Dad, all my friends are going! -Oh, so I assume Steven will be there. -So what are you talking about? Oh, come on. I know about Steven. Steven? Who's this Steven? I don't know. She's your daughter. Talk to her! Remember I told you you cannot go out alone with Steven. Dad! How come alone? Hello? That's JS Prom. Everybody will be there. Marla! Come back here! Did you see that? Come on. Let's have dinner. [Virgie] Marla! You forgot to eat. Here, I brought you some. I have no appetite. Hmm. Here you go. [sighs] You know, it is you. Why do you have to talk back to your Aunt Monique? I just don't know why they have to always persecute me here. My friends are allowed to go out without curfew. Angelique has her own car. But me? None. Too bad for you you weren't born into your friend's family. What you should do is look at what blessings you have. And you're not a child anymore! It seems like your Aunt Monique is not in a good position now. I don't think so. She's having the time of her life ever since my dad married her. Really? Haven't you thought about what she has to do every day just to please you? Look at how you treat her. [chuckles] You're being too harsh, Yaying! You make me sound so bad. True! [in English] You are bad if you want to be very bad. -[giggling] -[in Taglish] Is my English okay? Slightly, yes. See? I now know English from staying in this house. Here, eat up. Don't think about it first. Go ahead. Eat up. Thank you. Eat. -Have some. -Okay. -Sir. -Don't forget my instructions to you. Yes, sir. I left my address and phone number in Hong Kong on my work table, so tell that to your ma'am. Yes, sir. When is she coming back though? -From what I know, this coming Sunday. -Sunday. -All right. Take care of everything here. -Yes, sir! Take care! -Here! -[exclaims] -[upbeat music playing] -Here are the padlocks. Here are the keys. Lock up all our gates. Okay, but, Auntie, why do we have to lock up all our gates? It seems that there are prisoners here. We have to make sure that no prisoners will escape! Bring those keys back to me. Okay, no problem. -You make sure. -Okay. Yes, I promise. Okay. [upbeat music playing] [phone chiming] Oh, my God. So what's the plan? Is Marla coming? I don't know. [phone ringing] Guys, wait. Marla! Give me 30 minutes, okay? Or make it an hour. What about? Pick me up here. I thought you told me you are grounded? Steve, just pick me up! I'll just get dressed, okay? Marla, be honest. Are you using drugs? How many times did your Dad say that you are prohibited from going out? Please, Yaying! This is a matter of life or death! And what if we get caught? You're alive, I'm dead! -Please stop it, Marla. -[sighs] Okay, Yaying, can you give me one or one and a half hours? Yaying, everybody's looking for me in the JS Prom! My friends are all there except me! Okay, but how will you get out? Look, all our gates are locked up, and all the keys are with Aunt Bibing. You want me to help you escape to the car? What do you mean? I'll be the one to get the keys? Are you out of your mind? Yes. And when you come back from the party? I'll be the one to wait for you? No way! No way! No way! Yes way! No, Marla, that won't happen. I'm sorry, Marla. Please.... [snoring] [inaudible] [clears throat] [snoring] -[Virgie] Marla! -My friends are here to pick me up. Keep your phone close. I'll be calling you when I'm coming home. All right. Please make it fast. When your Dad finds out about this... [Marla] I love you so much! [Virgie] Don't say that to me anymore. Just hurry up! [Marla] Make it fast! [Virgie] Please don't get impregnated by the guy you are with. [Marla] You're too vulgar! [Virgie] Hurry up! I'll be dead when your dad finds out about this! Come back early. [suspenseful music plays] [phone ringing] Virgie! Virgie! What the... I was so scared! I might have a heart attack! The phone is ringing! Hello? Hello! The telephone is the one ringing! Is it the telephone? That's Marla. It's Marla. [phone ringing] Hello? [man] Is this the Sevilla Residence? Yes, who is this? This is the Taguig Police Precinct. To whom can we talk about Ms. Marla Sevilla? Marla's in a police precinct? [man] How are you related to Ms. Marla Sevilla? Your father specifically and repeatedly told you that you could not go to the prom. And everyone in this household was given instruction not to let you out! Sorry. That's all you can say? "Sorry"? After you and your boyfriend had an accident? Marla, all you can say is "sorry"? You almost died! And the gate was locked. Manang had the keys. So how did you get it? Uh, I'm just curious... we were all asleep. The gates were locked. [Bibing] The keys were with me. In my room. So that's it. How did you get it, Marla? Helen. -Yes? -What do you know about this? -I just woke up-- -It's me, ma'am. I was the one who helped Marla. [Monique] Are you doing this on purpose? You deliberately went against my orders. Everything is ruined. Look what happened. Ma'am, I pitied the child. And she told me they have a JS Prom. Wait a minute. What right have you to make decisions for my husband's children? That what you think is more important than what Tonichi says? It's because I understand the child. Okay, so we don't understand her? Is that what you're trying to say? That after one year, you are suddenly a better parent than me and Tonichi. [voice breaking] No way, ma'am. No way. Virgie. I have given you enough chances already. I don't think this is going to work out anymore. Ma'am? Prepare your things. In two hours, I will ask Dave to take you wherever you want to go. [melancholy music playing] I've prepared the check for three months' worth of your salary. So that you won't think that we are not grateful for everything you've done for the kids. I think... this will be enough for you and your family until you find another job. [melancholy music continues] [Monique sighs] [sniffles] [woman sobs] Virgie. [crying] [Kevin] Yaying! [all crying softly] It's okay. That's enough. [Kevin] Are you leaving us? Yaying. I'm so sorry. That's all right. I want you all to be good. [crying] Be good, children. Don't be naughty! Take care of yourselves. -[Jocelyn] Bye, Virgie! -Bye! Can you open the door, please? Sorry, I'll do it. It opened. [Kevin crying] Yaying! [all crying softly] Sis, sorry. It's all so sudden. We weren't able to clean up. It's because no one really lives here. That's why we made it into a storage room. Mina, I should be the one who's ashamed. I'm the one who bothered you guys. Mina, Virgie, I bought some roasted chicken. Let's eat. You know, I'm so thankful to both of you. You know I have no relatives here in Manila. That's why I am so thankful that you let me in here. -It's nothing. -Okay, I'll just prepare our dinner. All right. [gentle music playing] Look, what I cannot understand is why didn't you wait for me before you asked the nanny to leave! Wait a minute. Who am I in this house, Ton? You give more importance to the nanny than me? I am your wife, aren't I? -They love her! Do you understand? -And they don't love me, is that it? Is that why the nanny should stay here rather than me? Look, I'm sorry... You know that's not true. Then what should I believe? Because I've done everything to win your kids over. But they don't want me. And you don't believe it, Ton. Look, Ton, I don't know anything about children. I'm not Marilen. And I am not trying to replace her. All I'm asking for is a little respect from the people who live in this house. [knocking on door] Marla, please, we are still talking. I know that. That's why I need to speak up. Auntie, I am sorry. It's my fault. If someone should leave, it's not Yaying. Certainly it's not you. Because it is my fault. I'm the one who made the mistake. I'm the one who should leave. I'm so sorry, Auntie. I'm so sorry. [cries softly] It's my fault. Because I never gave you a chance, thinking that... you wanted to replace Mommy. Marla... how could I ever do that? Many people can love us, but we can only have one mother. I just want to be your friend. Virgie, you can stay here. In two weeks time, I'll be leaving again. I'll be on the ship again for the next six months. My God! You'll be in the middle of the sea for six months? And he has been to so many countries, you'd be surprised. That's how we Filipinos are. We bear all the sacrifices just for the welfare of our families, for them to have better lives. How about you, Virgie? What's your plan? I will just look for another job. Hopefully, at my age, someone will still trust me. Sir? Why are you here? Virgie, get your things and come back to our house. [lively music playing] Sir Tonichi. Good morning. This is my husband, Moy. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. I asked Rey to accompany me. I asked Virgie to come back to our house. Oh, don't ask anything. Go back to the house because we need you there. -Sir... -What? Uh... how about ma'am? You won't have any problem with her. Why? You don't want to work with us anymore? -Sir-- -What? Do you want it or not? I want to, sir. [chuckles] Okay, then. Get your things so we can go home. [laughing and sobbing] [crying] Virgie, are you crying or laughing? Same sir. This is the first time you've seen me crazy, but I've been like this. [giggling and crying] [upbeat music playing] [woman] Ma'am. Virgie, after you fix your things, let's talk with your ma'am. Yes, sir! [girls screaming] Good evening, ma'am. Virgie, the reason why I asked you to come back is that the kids explained everything that had happened. -And I wanted to tell you that-- -Sir, sir, wait. Can I speak up? Just to be clear. I'm the one who's at fault. Ma'am was right. She's been telling me to look after Marla, so she won't get away, but then I helped Marla to get out. So you're admitting that you are guilty? Yes, sir! I am guilty. It was really my fault. Promise. And also, ma'am, sir, maybe you're fed up with my apology, but... I'm really sorry and thank you for giving me a second chance. Okay. But we have to be clear on one thing. Are you still with me? Yes, ma'am. I am very much with you. -You have to help me, okay? -Help? What kind of help, ma'am? Help me raise the kids, Virgie. You're the one who's experienced with kids. You're a mom. Please help me. Ma'am, you're the mom, and I am a nanny. And, ma'am, wait. Here's your check. So that there won't be any problem. We are okay now, ma'am, right? Okay, then. Go to the children's room and clean it. It's been two days since you left, and it's already filthy and smelly. I also think so, ma'am. And you know what, ma'am? The two kids really want to love you. And you know what, ma'am? Anyone can be a mom if they're only given a chance to love the children. I'll go ahead. Ma'am, sir, I'll go upstairs. Oh, what are those smiles for? [both] Welcome home! [joyous music playing] How are my babies? [Virgie] Text me when you arrive where you will live, okay? Okay, Mamay. How many times will you tell me that? [giggles] I promise you. When I finish my studies, you won't have to go back to Manila to work. I will take care of you. Thank you, my child. Okay, Jonel, you should go ahead. It's a long trip ahead of you to the city. Ma, I wanted to ask you. Do you really love the kids already? Yes, my child. They're just like your siblings. Siblings? Yes, my child. Being a mother is never a job. Whoever needs motherly love, you can give it. Because that is what's right. I hope they also love you, Mamay. Just like they are really my siblings. You take care. -All right. Take care of yourself, Jonel. -I'll go ahead, Papay. Take care. Text me, my child! [Virgie] Buy some credit for your cellphone. [voice breaking] Text me. -Why are you crying? -[joyful music playing] You should be happy because our child went to college, and that's your dream. That's the fruit of your labor. It's because everything we've been through, every hardship, it's all done. I know, but in a few days, you will go back to Manila. I will just go back to Manila, but I will still come home here, my love. Promise? Promise. [giggles] [engine revving] [joyful music playing] [joyful music continues] [upbeat music playing]
