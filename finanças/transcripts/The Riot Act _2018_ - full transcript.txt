Yes? Are you certain? Of course I'm certain! Papa? Papa? No, no, no, no. Papa, no! Excuse me, Jamieson, sir? Pardon me. Yes? Dr. Pearrow is waiting to speak with you outside. Dr. Pearrow? Now? Yes, out front. Thank you. Good evening, sir. Remove your gloves. Excuse me? Take off your gloves. It's humiliating enough that my daughter was seen sneaking around town with a married man but to think that she was gonna board a train tonight with someone of your hobby. Sir. She is my daughter! I swear to God, if you weren't the only reason that my seats are full in my opera house, I would kill you right here. Tonight will be your last night on my stage! After that there won't be a worthy stage or a concerned father either side of the Mississippi that doesn't know of your defilement! If I was you, I would catch that late train tonight... Alone. Yah! Oh. Allye. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Your father, he said I have to... He's a fool. You were leaving without me. I had no choice. He knows. Nobody can mind their own business in this town. Hey. It's me. It's us. It's everything we dreamed about. Okay? Of course. Of course. No, no. No, no. No, no, no, wait, no. We have to go, please, please. How many have entrance to the theater? Only the two keys. Change the locks today. The entire engagement will end two weeks from tomorrow. The first week's only dress rehearsals but I think it'll still spark interest among the public. The theater itself, however, will remain off limits until the evening performances. Nickelodeons and side shows will be situated along a street generating completely separate earnings from the seat sales. How many fixtures are not currently in use? They're all in use, sir. Make sure that a bulb is burning in the house whenever vacant. May I inquire to the request, sir? Safety reasons. About the electricity. No matter the cost. Sorry to interrupt. You did. Sir? You interrupted. August, knock before entering. Of course. I sincerely apologize, sir. What is it? They've arrived. Ah, this will do. Good day, Mr. Grimes. The company looks just like the flyers we've been receiving. That's because we've been the one sending them. We're so glad to finally play host to you. This is our proud owner and world-renowned physician, Dr. Willard I. Pearrow. A fine town, it seems, Doctor, and a quant venue. We shouldn't have trouble filling your seats. That's why you've been brought here. In my experience, fine theater doesn't put asses in seats anymore but don't worry, behind me, here, is the finest vaudeville in the east. And our main attraction, well, we'll have even the gentlemen running to check their undergarments. Same two-bit thrills under a new vail. Well the days of the three act are dying, Doctor. People need entertainment. Whatever will remove them from the wretched lives they're living. Instead of two parts, I deliver an eight. Four acts with an intermission followed by another four. The first three dumb acts will captivate the audience before we hit them with a strong act heading into intermission. Our lovely ladies will pull us back in before we introduce our main attraction, as I was saying before, in an experience like no other company in the wold! That, alone, makes our fee well worth it, I assure you. Well, you have a limited engagement, as discussed. Well then, no need to waste any time, is there? If you please, I prefer to load in the rear. It'll be my pleasure. Jack. Oh, I'm certain my correspondence was with August. I'll unlatch the doors, sir. It's gonna be a fantastic show, Doctor. I trust this isn't your main attraction, Mr. Grimes. Miss Rosa is one of our dumb acts. He means silent. Ah. Please forgive our inexperience, Mr. Grimes, we've never played host to a vaudeville show. Only opera. Wonderful, dear. Thank you. Gentlemen, I've developed a way to fulfill the human desire for riveting sacrifice. Thanks to my latest, if you please. Jack: Oh! Holy Christ! What is going on here? Explain yourself. Dear gracious Lord. What we have here is one step closer to bridging the gap between make believe and reality. My guess is you'll fancy at this trick, Doctor. A simple physician's bulb with reusable rubber tubing attached to a tiny bubble of animal intestine. Run the tube to the chest and/or stomach, anywhere you like, really, fill the device with whatever animal blood you can spare and at the sound of a gunfire, voil√†. Well done, Mr. Grimes. It' like witnessing an actual killing. See, unlike our doctor, here, who has seen this before in your profession, we have never experienced a truly convincing death on stage. There's something about seeing the blood run from the wound that makes it sincere. No shame, no guilt, in seeing something you otherwise wouldn't. Because you can simply walk out of those theater doors and go back to your normal life. Indeed. Well done. Jack will accommodate what you need. Looking forward to it, Doctor. Do not forget, you are not to be backstage during the shows. You are to purchase a ticket like the rest. Yes, sir, of course. Sidewalks need sweeping. What the hell are you doing back here? You're supposed to be in the opera house. Are you gonna tell me now what I have to do to get rid of you? What are you doing? What are you doing? Why did you come back here? These are not sets to be moved in and out like an opera, Mr. Jack. Yes, sir, and I completely understand what you're saying. Well, I'll say it again. We have over a half dozen acts. Our sets must be flown in an out quickly. We do not have the manpower, nor do you have the wing space to house props. Let alone, if the trestles will hold the weight, we've never done this sort of thing. I was assured we'd be properly outfitted with this venue, Mr. Jack. Trestles will hold fine. It's reinforced steal. Molded myself to withstand winds from a tornado, same with every other building on Main Street. You did, aye? Only blacksmith in town. Doubling as a stagehand? August came to use shortly after our doors opened. It's nice to have someone on the inside who helped with construction to build it. Very well. Good to have someone educated around. August, we agreed I'd be kept up to speed with all the details. I know, I'm sorry. Pearrow would read me the Riot Act if there's even the slightest hitch in this show. Of course, I know, and I'm sorry. I'll be more thorough, I promise. I trust you, August. It's gonna be great. I'd like to honor the man who puts this town on the world map. His contributions make our town soon to be one of the greatest in the world. Doctor, to your most recent blessing, the electrifying of the courthouse, without your kind and generous heart we would be a lessor society. Truly. Where there is potential, no amount of money can surmount the reward. Now, if we could just rid the town of the filth that still lingers. To Dr. Pearrow. So, Doctor, I think what we are all interested to hear about is the new event taking place at theater this weekend. Yes, the show. It's been stirring quite a buzz amongst the merchants downtown. More enthusiasm than uncertainty, I assure you, but a bit of both. Well, it will be a fine show. Things unseen by anyone here before. It's the latest rage in the theater back east. Word is the main attraction is the likes of a superhuman being. They say he can bend steel with his bare hands. Even take a cannon ball to the stomach with little more than a flinch. Have you seen it? I heard the same. Well, you'll just have to come and see the show. Seats will be reserved to members only, I hope. I mean, I hate to take Grace to market anymore, what, with all the people around. You know, diseases. Well, of course our seats will be reserved. It's no different than a night at the opera, right, Doctor? I think it'll be a fantastic evening. I've always wondered what it'd be like to attend a variety show. It's not a variety show. It's high end vaudeville, it's quite different. Indeed. And I assure you, the audience will be divided in their respected places. The theater always feels best when her seats are full. As do your pockets, aye, Willard? Well, it is rightful time to see the theater operating again, regardless of method. Will it be lamb today, dear? I think I'd like to try something a bit less fatty. Do you think they have quail like we had in Little Rock? Ow! Dear, that was Allye's meal. Since when was the club open to nonmembers? My apologies, sir, but it is only open to members. Hmmm. No, sir, not on the bottom floor. Your seats are on the balcony. You are not allowed to stand here. - But I was told... - Front of the balcony, sir. These are for members only. Com on! Move, let's go! Go get Lillian. Yes. Lily's on right now. Go get someone then! Sit down. What's wrong with you? Everything okay, Mr. Grimes? Uh... Uh, well... No, no, no, it isn't. Our headliner has injured himself. This is him. What happened, exactly? This genius thought it wise to assist in moving sets right before his own damn performance! If you hired stage hands that could lift more than a bag of flower... Shut up! Shut up! Is he still able to go on? Not if we don't get it back in place quickly, no. What happened? He's an ignorant fool is what happened! Dislocated again, Lily. Move back, please. It's going to hurt. I know. Come on! Harder! Has anyone have a gag? Yeah, I've got a... I'm not going to be able to do it. Damn it! We need an actual doctor. I know set a dislocation. It just won't take. Where is Dr. Pearrow? - No. - No. You don't want him to know about this. If we don't pop it back in place like normal, something is more seriously wrong and then we don't have a goddamn show! I'll try to find Jack. We wanna thank you all again for joining us this evening. Please come back tomorrow night for a replay of the show and the vigorous presentation of our main event! Come on! What is this? Hey, Lily. How do you always know what to do? My father was a doctor. You must've made him proud. Just keep it as still as you can until morning. Hey! Reveal yourself. Remove it. Take it off! You? How did you get into the theater? What on Earth are you doing? What is this about? I have a thing for stage. Don't play with me, I saw you, I saw you at... I've seen you around here before in that costume. I saw you too. I don't know what you mean. It was certainly a surprise. But I was confident that I recognized your face. As anybody from here would. And again, when I saw you here. The phony accent isn't enough to distract from that. I'll only ask once more, what are you doing with Dr. Pearrow? I can't tell you that. You don't have much of a choice! If you so much as breathe a word of this, don't approach me. Don't even look in my direction. Do you understand? Wait. I have no idea your intention's worth turning. And to be honest, I'm not sure I want the answer. But your secret will die with me. I need to know mine will do the same. Lily? How are you today? I'm sorry? Are you feeling well enough to perform? Of course. Are you all feeling well enough to do your jobs today? Hmmm? My clinic was at full capacity this morning when I arrived and I thought it to be a good day. Yet, not a single one of them was waiting for medicine, no! One by one, they inquired about a refund from last evening's show. Because of some unexplained reason the one performance they came to see, which has been posted all over town, the most shocking human being alive, decided to stay home! Why wasn't I informed of this immediately?! Huh?! Why?! You see, Doctor, unfortunate circumstances sometimes do arise. Especially given our profile of risk. We tried you numerous times by wire, sir, but we were never able to reach you. I was indisposed. Had we reached you, we may have been able to continue the show in time or today, at the latest. It was, in fact, a medical emergency. Show me! You stay. I must be asleep and dreaming if you think I'm more fool enough to put a negro on my stage as a main attraction. Sir, you are thicker than I first thought! Negros are not new to the stage. Not here, not on this stage! This is not a goddamn circus! This is an acclaimed opera house! Not grounds for your experiments. How could you have allowed this? Mr. Grimes never made me aware he was colored. This is the strongest human being these people have ever witnessed, okay? One they'll pay good money to see. And now he's gone and hurt himself? He's dislodged joints before but we can't seem to get this one back in place. I'm afraid, this time it's more serious. And now you're in need of my medical expertise. If Dr. Pearrow fixes, fixes his arm, will he be well enough to perform tomorrow? A day's recovery at the very least. You know that, Doctor. Unbelievable. Drop your hand, sir. You will not be paid for this evening or last night's performance. That was not our agreement, Doctor. It states clearly in the contract that acts of God may happen. Please, oh please, threaten me. We both know good and well that you couldn't feed your horses or your clowns without my pocket! The only act of God will be you recovering from being thrown out of my acclaimed opera house! Just inhale. Deep. There you go. Slower. There you go. A cigar? Wish I could take credit myself. From your father. Thank you. It's the least I could do. For keeping your word. Likewise. You're a household name here. Mothers and fathers use you as an example for their children now. Only to them, I'm rotting in the ground somewhere while my father walks around as the hero who murdered my assailant. Two years and never finding my body. Why has no one questioned it? It's a matter of who they're questioning. It's your father. Half this town wouldn't exist if it wasn't for him. There's many rumors as to why you were killed. But I have to say, I'm more interested in what prompted him to pull the trigger. Either way, he knew he was losing a daughter that night. My father's never seen far enough past himself to see his daughter. Your only concern is why I returned. You already knew I was alive. Thought you'd at least get one. Ah, never lecture. Hope exceeds your own grasp, August. If it wasn't for us, the damn walls wouldn't even be standing. Oh, stop with your mouth. If it wasn't us, they'd have just caught the next two able-bodied fellas capable to the job. Be grateful for the work and the smell of the freshly stained timbers. The vibrant red glow of the curtains. The creaking of the tight stretched ropes just groaning with a strain. Twas the life or wasn't it? Truly. Why don't you head on home now, okay? It's freezing. I've one this a hundred times. I know. I'll finish up as soon as the train leaves. And don't bother the engineer. Allye. No. No, no, no, no, no. Jamieson, no. No, no, you don't have to go. Please, don't go, please. Your father stated in his report that he was attacked that night by the actor with a ball-peen hammer. Are you the only one who knows? My grandfather. But he made me promise on his life that I wouldn't breathe a word of it. The hammer belonged to us. No question where the blame will go. You have no intention of having your father convicted. I could've done that two years ago. You know what a girl like yourself would receive if she walked into your father's clinic with a cough and a fever? An exam? Perhaps a treatment of oxygen? Right. You know what I would get for those same symptoms? Just told to breathe deep and smoke until the pain subsides. That it would relax the throat and lungs. See, people like your father, they live above everybody else. He's only for himself and the people like him. No outside greater balance exists, even within his own circle. Thank you, again. Westbound train passes through here tonight. It's not going to again for two days. See you around here tomorrow? I have yet to accomplish what I came here for. Sir? Sir? The entire block smells like horse shit. What, sir? I bring in a new show for the first time in two years and I promise it's gonna be new and cutting edge. Not the lesser sophisticated variety coming form up north. And yet, it smells like we are housing the entire Union Calvary behind the theater. And the patrons who saw the show last night don't have the slightest idea that the headliner they missed was, in fact, a negro. So tell me, Jack, what do you propose that I do now? I don't know, sir, I didn't know, as I said. You didn't know. Sir, August was... Sir! August, the foreman? Tell me, son, what do you think I should do? Sir, I could only imagine refund the patrons. Perhaps offer them a simple apology. Apology? Apologize. My employees haven't the slightest idea how to manage their responsibilities. I wasn't able to attend, sir. I couldn't afford a ticket, sir. Perhaps August is right. Refund them for last night and we'll surely sell any remanding tickets for tomorrow night. Of course. Why shouldn't I sacrifice for the hard working and deserving people of this town? They have a right to a town and my practice, and of course, entertainment. After all, it was their callus little hands the forged the bricks that I build it with. So it's settled. Be off. The theater needs cleaning before tonight. It's already done. Do it again. When is money more valuable than your reputation, Willard? This show, this show is eroding my reputation. And the main attraction will be well to resume Saturday? Two days is long enough. Is he really like everyone is saying? His size, his strength. I've yet to see what he does in person. Supposedly it's remarkable enough it brings people back three or four times just to see it. That, according to Jack, apparently. Well, I think it is a wise idea to make them wait. Exclusivity only leads to heightened desires. I wanna ask you a question. And I want you to think openly about it. Have you ever seen the dead? Willard, still? It's worse. Any new ideas who it could be? I've told you before, it's not a man. Oh, Willard, it is a fool in a mask. A fool will only be demanding money. That's all they ever want. There was no one else on that platform that night. So? I see him wearing exactly what he had on that night. Then who? An accomplice of his? No one new him. How about another degenerate taken with Allye? I swear, sometimes I wish you hadn't killed the bastard so I could kill him myself, that precious girl. But I'm sorry Willard, as I was saying, either someone is patronizing you or you've been drinking with someone more than just me, in which case, we have a real problem. Oh yes, I wrote to my brother in New York. I told him of the show that you brought in. He and his wife love the theater and attend regularly. I'm sure he's seen or, at least, heard of them. As for tomorrow night, just give a nice and heartfelt apology. I have nothing to apologize for. Then make something up, Willard. And after you've finished, come back to my lovely establishment. You know you're welcome here anytime. You've never seen that thing here, right? No. Willard, sometimes people need to see us reduced to their own understanding. Let them see you relate. I'm so sorry. I had no idea how difficult this was gonna be. I miss you. I miss my little girl. I have to apologize. Some of you may remember, two years ago, on this exact day, my child, my only child was taken from me from a performer from this very stage. I miscalculated, I miscalculated about... seeing her seats full again and... how much we enjoyed that together. But I assure you, I assure you that if, let me see, I assure you we will reopen tomorrow night with a fire and excitement that I know my daughter would welcome. Prayed she'd be with us this evening. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I wanted to take a moment and address you properly. To inform you that this evening's performance unfortunately is canceled entirely and will reopen again tomorrow night. Everyone here, this evening, including the victims of last night's letdown will be given a full refund for your ticket price. And, in addition, a free ticket to any street activities outside for the remainder of the weekend. I have to apologize. Some of you may remember that two years ago, on this exact date, was the evening my only child was taken from me by the hands of a performer from this very stage. But for the love of theater and entertainment we all come here for, my daughter was murdered. I chose this weekend intentionally, after these two long years, to reopen this theater to honor my daughter and to restore the hope that theater brings. But I miscalculated how difficult that would be seeing her seats full again, as she and I used to enjoy together. So, I ask your forgiveness, and that out of respect that you please join me in closing this show this evening in remembrance of my precious Allye. But I assure you that we will reopen tomorrow with the fire and excitement that I know she would welcome, should she have been here with us this evening. Thank you. Come here! Who are you?! Who are you?! Why couldn't you just do it? Sorry for what happened to you. I know you've never had the comfort of hearing those words and I can't imagine going through that on your own. Kiss me. No. Kiss me. Where's the hat, Allye? Allye, where's the hat? I was right there. All I had to do was pull the trigger and I couldn't. He grabbed me. He what? - I didn't mean to... - What?! There are rules, Allye! Specific methods to follow when wearing this mask! You do not speak, you do not touch and God forbid you ever corner yourself in a situation where you could be caught. Be calm, he didn't see who I was. That's not the point! He's only terrified of this because he believes it is not real! It is out of his control if it's not real. Have you seen him alone in this theater? No! Because he believes in what lingers within these walls! For over a year I've haunted him as the man that he murdered and you just ruined it. It's not ruined. Really? Then let's act now. Before the sun rises. The two of us, we can overpower him. Overpower him? You think I'm gonna help you murder him? Hey! I came here for one thing! You've been the only obstacle in my way! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even still be in this pathetic town! You don't even exist in this pathetic town. You have resolved to the same felt as him. You can create an entirely new life for yourself and you came back here. For two years I've been plagued with knowing that my so-called father robbed me of the only desire I ever pursued. Every day I look around and I wonder how much better my life would be if I had, indeed, just done as he had asked had I pursued medicine as was expected of me. Maybe he was right. But then he proved his intentions when he pulled that trigger. Revenge is nothing but self-serving. There's no freedom in that. Oh, and you're not taking the same? Had my father given you and your grandfather seats in the front row, I'd imagine you'd feel differently. I've tired to move on. I will only be able to forgive him when he feels the same pain he's dealt. That's not forgiveness. Get out of that suit! August. William, here, is just asking me some questions about the vaudeville troop we've been hosting. Jack tells me you're the mastermind behind this operation. I think he's just being modest. He said you found the troop yourself. Did all the research on them and the legwork to get 'em here. I did, yes. And had you seen the troop prior? No, sir, I had only heard of them. They're one of the most talked about shows in the east. Oh, indeed, they are. My brother happens to frequent the theater in the east, a fair critic, I might add. Most talked about only of embarrassment. They've been kicked out of numerous venues for their progressive agenda. August, how much research did you do prior? Who did you even speak to about this? It is my guess that your foreman was only out to soil the name of Willard Pearrow. You were determined for this show to fail, where you not? Sir, I'm sorry but August has been nothing but a valuable asset to this theater. He's never do anything so destructive. August? You don't deny it? You knew Allye, didn't you? You knew the boy who killed her. Is this some sort of payback for Willard killing your reprehensible friend? Hmmm? Get Willard on the wire. Hey! Hey, where do you think you're going?! Get back here! Hey! Hey, you think you're just gonna walk away from this?! Hey! You turn around when I'm addressing you, boy! You turn around! Out of my way! Hey, August, where do you think you're going?! This is our town, boy! August, hey! Do you think this suit makes you powerful? Huh? Here, I could injure you right now and I'd be gone before anyone knew what happened to you. Willard will hear of this. Do you think that's wise? That's not all you're doing to him, is it? Hmmm? Oh, you don't intimidate me the way you do him. There's a night train headed west tonight. He knows. I don't know the extent but he knows something or he will very soon. I'm not leaving until I have what I came for. The first night that I encountered him, I had every intention of disclosing what I'd seen that night under a mask that would protect me. Before I even uttered a word, the look of fear in his face from what he thought that he was looking at was more humiliating than anything that I'd ever seen. He look terrified. Like a pathetic little bully who was finally facing backlash from is peers. I wanted him to pay for what he'd done. I wanted to see him tried and hanged. But little-did-I-know that this would be so much more fulfilling. Death does not feel the same to all of us. I have a plan and I can't do it without you but he stays alive. Do you understand me? How the hell did you get this?! You stole it from my house! What now, coward? Show me your face! You keep it covered because you know what I could do to you! What? Are you gonna kill me now? Finally? You stop. You stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! You stop! No, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, no! No! No! No! No! No! No! Boo. Do you know how this knife was made? Starts nothing more than a block of ore. It's heated in a kiln. Slowly melted. Longer, thinner, sleeker. Then an edge. Finally, a shinny and polished blade. A tool made from the very callused hands that you despise. Yet, in this moment, when in these hands make no different, does it, you and I? It was you all along. I thought it was reaching out from the grave. I gave you a chance. You had a chance. I let you get away with murder once and it wasn't gonna happen again. What? What're you talking about? I only ever asked for one thing from you. I had in my possession your most damning secret. I needed your help in return. The thought of my grandfather was never your concern. Only how the people around you stared. See, if you had taken the moment to look at my grandfather the first time, you would know that cigar smoke only worsens his condition, doesn't it? But an old blacksmith like him, he wasn't warranted a diagnoses from Dr. Pearrow. I didn't know. You knew. It was that moment I fully realized death brings no concern in your life. Father. Allye? For two years I tried to rid you from my life. You've come back. Oh, darling. It was you? It was you the whole time? Not a day goes by that I don't despise the man I once called my father. Please, let me see your face. Please, Allye, I need to see your face, please. Please, Allye. Please, no, no, no, no, no. Please. Please, Allye, please. - Papa, look, there's Dr. - Pearrow! I don't deserve this. You're gonna wish you were dead after this. Allye, no! Allye. No, August. - Oh God, are you okay? - What'd you do? Is it deep? Hold on. August, we have to go. We can't miss the train. You have to walk. You can make it. - Just a bit. - No, I can't do it. Ow! Okay, let me see it. - Oh, okay. - Is it bad? - Ow! - Put pressure on it. Okay, stay right here. Where you going? What're you doing? I got to find something to put on it. Okay. Ow! I know, I know. No. We have to make it to the station. No, no, no, I can't do that, I can't walk. You have to. I can't do it, I'm not gonna be able to do it. Okay. Okay. You have to tell them that you had no part in this. I forced you to do it, you didn't know. No you're not, you're not going. You can't leave me here. He's not here anymore. You don't have to worry about him. We weren't supposed to kill him. We agreed that we weren't gonna do that. Why did you do that? I'm sorry. Would you have still come with me? I would, I... Would you have still come with me? Okay. Okay. - I'm so sorry. - Stay with me. - I can't. - Please don't do this. Allye, Allye, you're not gonna go, please! - I'm so sorry. - You can't go. Put your hand here. You have to leave your hand here. It's gonna be okay. You little shit! Arrest this one! Can't you see he's been shot? Yep. Just passing through. Wait! Just me. "I am the spirit that negates", "and rightfully so," "for all that comes to be" "deserves to parish wretchedly." "'Twere better nothing would begin." "Thus everything that that your terms, sin,." "Destruction," "evil represent." "That is my proper element." He must be handed over to the marshals at once! Sir, you can't arrest him in his condition. He hasn't woken since his surgery. Will he? He's in no immediate danger but as I said, he hasn't waken since his surgery. I want to know as soon as he awakes. I will let you know if he wakes. Daniel, I'm needing to close all the the accounts of Willard Pearrow as well as any safe boxes in his name. I have his testament here. Of course. Give me a moment. And his accounts. Well this is it here. All that remained in his lockboxes are. There must be some mistake. It shows here that the trust was emptied two days ago. Emptied by who? Who would have had access to Willard's trust? All his family is dead. Well that's not possible. She's... Thank you. Excuse me. Is there any chance the boy wakes up? I'm sorry, sir, are you family? No, no, the boy has no family. His former employer. Look, we've done all we can. All right, we've found no further damage. The bullet went through his stomach, yes? Actually, it missed his stomach. Missed all major organs. Coma's a funny thing. It can be induced by a severe trauma of any kind. Doesn't have to be the head. How long can he live like this? It could be days. It could be weeks. Thank you. Miss, how long do I have to be in this? I got to get back down there. Well, it isn't gonna do you any good if you're not alive to spend it. How? This will change everything. I know it, I got to get out of here. Down. Can I interest you in a fountain drink, ma'am? Mixture of syrup and carbonated water. It'll certainly quench your thirst on what's looking to be a warm day. Coming right up.
