"THE MIND IS ITS OWN PLACE AND IN ITSELF, CAN MAKE A HEAVEN OF HELL..." "...A HELL OF HEAVEN." - John Milton, Paradise Lost The great poet, Goethe, said at the end of his life that he couldn't see one single mistake among his fellow human beings that he hadn't himself committed. If Goethe saw his fellow humans like this, how do you think then that the Son of Man looks upon us? Jesus' message is one of forgiveness. So, my dear friends: There is no Hell. Now you want to sing, right? We will. Now it happeneds that there are two psalm numbers on the board. So which should we take? We'll actually do both at once. Because it's so that in the psalm book from 1937, we'll be singing psalm number 21. I've written 297 to prevent confusion in case it should so be that any of you has the edition from 1986. But both my dad and me... ...we might snort a bit about these kinds of modern things. But now you know. Psalm 21, "Wonderful is the Earth". If it is so that one imagines certain things, Elsie, it is possible to receive medical help. One can talk to a doctor, one can get medicial help... Nothing helps. I see things. When is the last time that you saw a spirit? I see one right now. - Now? In here? - Yes. To the left, behind you. I can't see anything. - Can you see who this spirit is? - Yes. It's your mother. Really? I see. And what does little mom want? She is sad. Extremely sad. - About whom? - About you. I think that we do so that you go home and take a calming bath. And then you open The Good Book and read something from The Book of Psalms. - And which psalm should I read? - It doesn't matter. They're all hits. - Hello. - Hi, Karolina. - Has he eaten? - Sausage and macaroni, and a little chocolate ice cream. - And a little... Seems there's always room for that. - Just like last time. It's gone very well. And the meeting with Elsie? Yes, it... It went well. Yes, I think so. It went well. I'm meeting her tomorrow. - Did you sleep last night? - Yes. Did you dream again? About your mother in the kitchen? - You have been dreaming the same dream for two weeks. - Please, it'll work out. Is he in his room? He's going to be really happy about that. How are you? Is everything going well? It looks like it's going well, so I won't disturb. It's just that it feels a little lumpy here in the sofa. Do you think - I think there's possibly a present lying here. A small present to Jesper from daddy. It's not... It's no... Just a small thing. - Hi! - Hi, mommy. - We're going to have fun tomorrow. - Hi. Hi. I'll take it. - Are you going to tell your daddy goodbye? - You're at Henrik Horneus' place. I'll let you steer. Tell your daddy goodbye. He's a little occupied. Can I tell him anything? Super. Super. I understand. - Come on. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, son. - Have a good time then. - I'll tell him. Bye. It's just a phase. - Who was it? - It was the expert on forensic medicine in Hammerdal. The expert on forensic medicine in Hammerdal? What did he want? Henrik... Your dad is dead. - I'm sorry. - What? Okay. How... - And how did he die? - He drowned. I see. Right. Did he say anything else? But he must have said something. Didn't he leave a number? Don't you think that it's odd that it is... ...the expert on forensic medicine calling. It's the Police that should be delivering such messages. Is it the expert on forensic medicine that calls around saying such? Maybe there's so few people working with such up there. - There are few working with such? And you know this? - No I don't, but I could imagine... Yes, you can imagine, but you don't know. And I don't know either. None of us knows. I just find it odd. I think it's really odd. Extremely odd. - I need to go up there and solve this. - Now? You want to go now? - I'm planning on leaving now, yes. - You can't go tonight. And why can't I drive now? Because it's almost dark, and you're upset. It's dangerous for you to go. Okay. - I have to go. - Yes, of course. - You... - Goodbye. Very well. - Tell me if there's something I can do. - Yes, no worries. I can sleep over if you want me to. No, thank you, that's not necessary. Henrik! And in this late hour we have a listener with us. It's Gunn from Hede. Hi, Gunn. Welcome. Gunn, this is not the first time you're calling Hammerdal's local radio. You called last month to reveal a recipe. A recipe on a cake that has been passed down in your family for generations. - Yes, it was my father's mother's. - And what sorts of reactions did you get? - Reactions to what? - Was there a big commotion when you revealed your family's recipe? No. So, what makes you call us at an hour like this? - I want to tell someone hi. - And who do you want to tell hi? - I want to say hello to my mother. - Your mother? - Her name is Gurli. - And where does your mother live? She lives at... And what do you want to tell her? If she listens. Is she a night owl? I want to tell her... Hello! Hello! Hi. You're up very late. Do you live here? Together with your mother and father in the house over there? Has anything happened? How are you? My name is Henrik. And I'm a priest. - Hello? - Who is it? - Who is it? - No! I'm a priest! I actually am a priest. I'm a priest. That could be good to know. So you don't think that it's some unpleasant person that you're letting in. That you would possibly be willing to let in...I hope. I'm Henrik Horneus, by the way. My father was Gabriel Horneus. Who was... Who was a priest up here, from what I've understood. We offer our condolences. You can have Olle's room. You sleep on the sofa. Thank you. This is better than Grand Hotel. You... Excuse me, I didn't catch your name. Nora. - What were you doing by the barn? - By the barn... By the barn... Do you have more children? No. No... Do you know the expert on forensic medicine here? I need to ask him some questions in relation to my father's death. Then we wish the priest a good night's sleep. - Then we say good night. - Good night. Olle, we're sayig good night. Help me. Help me. He was a big man. I got it from your father. When I started at the faculty. I quit my studies. There were too many frauds. The Swedish church is full of them. It must have been fantastic to have a father like that. Without faith I would never have made it in this...family. But your father... - At every church service he read the psalm. - The psalm? Psalm 21. I assume that you, if anyone, are familiar with it. Yes. "Wonderful is the Earth." No. Olle, I want to ask you how... Whether you know how dad died? - Was it an accident? - I wouldn't say so. He was murdered. He was murdered? I don't understand what you mean. How was he murdered? His body was found in the Dead Lake. It's been light in the barn every night since he died. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Who murdered him? Time will show. Wait a minute... What is it that you're telling me? How do you know this? - God showed me. - God showed you? I wasn't allowed to go to the funeral. Ivar forbid me to. - Has dad been buried? - Your father was buried yesterday afternoon. They were obviously in a hurry to get him under ground. - Yes, it's Henrik. - It's me. - How are you? - Not so well. Why not? What's wrong? - Karolina, What's wrong? - Elsie... What is it about Elsie? What is it about Elsie? Has anything happened to her? Yes. She's dead. - Oh, Henrik... - When did this happen? - Yesterday. Yesterday evening. - When? - Does it matter? - At what time? - What time? - Sometime just before midnight. She didn't answer when I knocked, so I entered with my key. And in the bathroom... In the bathroom... Something was written on the bathroom wall. - What did it say? - Something was written. - What did it say? - And there were containers. - Containers for pills. - What did it say on the wall? - She had written it with blood. - What did it say? "Must Henrik... Must Henrik Horneus burn in hell!" And... Her face... We'll talk about it when I come home. - Don't hang up. - We'll talk about it later. - Please. - We'll talk about it later. We'll talk about it later. Yes, I think so. I don't know. I'll take him to the road. To the car. Then we'll have to fix that somehow. Yes, somehow. No, I don't think so. Then he wouldn't have stayed. Yes... Ivar. Very well. I thought... Now I and the priest with go to the priest's car and fix this. Yes, but I thought we could call the expert on forensic medicine. Now we'll make sure that the priest's car gets fixed. The practical part first. Yes, right, but we said yesterday that we should call the expert on forensic medicine... Det practical part first. When the house is built, can we put in the furniture. The practical part first. You can borrow Olle's boots. We'll fix the car first, then we'll fix the other things. The practical part first. No, it's dead. We're just going to have to wait for the tow truck. Let's remove it from the road. Yes? Hello? - Hi, my name is Henrik. - Go away. Are you related to Gabriel Horneus? Gabriel's boy. In Stockholm. With old grandmother. I haven't heard anything. He lived up there until the end. - And grandfather? - Alvar? He killed himself. In the broken tree by the road. Your father cut him down. One didn't talk about such. But my, the boy could preach. You can be proud. He frightened the entire village to healthy fear of God. He described the last judgement. What happends with those that betray God. What sort of pay that awaits. "If we can't hold our fingers in boiling water for a second," did he say, "how would it then feel like to be in a boiling pot for the rest of eternity?" It worked. But the Tempter hated it. Hated. And that was why he sent a messenger. He sendt her. Yes, even your father was a man in the flesh. It was disgraceful woman. A dirty, dirty little whore. And he fell. Over and over again. I asked him to fight! And Christ was victorious. But in the end... From the dirty stump spread the bad, and the bad got the upper hand. And it screamed in him. It screamed. The last day he walked around here as a foaming stallion. That was the last that I saw of my boy, when he went over to the whore for the last time. I think dad was murdered. I think it was the father of the Lidman family... No. No. The father of the Lidman family is an irreproachable man. There's a child there. It's no good child. So you must have felt. It's a damaged, horrible, evil child. A child that killed your father. No. Henrik. Henrik... Come, Henrik! Come. Mommy will show you. Mommy will show you everything! What were you doing in the barn? - Nothing. - What were you doing in the barn? I did nothing. Please, Olle, you have to believe me. My father. lvar... I hate that man. Hate. But our carnal fathers are nothing. Our spiritual father is everything. "Our God is coming. God's anger burst forwards like a storm." But the Roman letter... Paul says we should fight the evil with the good. Nahum from Alqosh: "The Lord is a vengeful God full of suffering." "The Lord revenges his opponents." Psalm 137: "Happy is the one who repays you according to what you have done to us." "Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks." "The mercy of the Lord infinite, his compassion never ends." - Psalm 58. - To forgive is the central part. Isaiah 1, verse 25: "I will avenge Me of Mine enemies." "And they shall both burn together, in a fire that will never end." "Glowing coal and sulphur: burning winds is the weight they'll get." Jesaja 66, vers 16: "With fire and with his sword the Lord will execute judgment on all people." "And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me." "The worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched." The Swedish church has since 1983 - refused the existence of a hell. - They're cowardly. They're cowards and infidels... The disgracful... Murderers! Their place is in the sea burning of sulfur and fire. "They shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." Book of Revelation, Chapter 20. 1983... Can you feel it? The Bronze Gates has opened. All the way down to the Ninth Circle. Open your eyes and see! Take the sword that God has put before you. PSALM 21. PSALM 21. "Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies..." "thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee." "Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace" "in the time of thine anger." "The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them." "Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth," "and their seed from among the children of men." "For they intended evil against thee," "they imagined a device," "wherewith they shall not prevail. For thou shalt make them turn their back," "thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them." "Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength," "so will we sing and praise Thy power." "Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies," "thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee." "Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace" "in the time of thine anger." "The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them." "Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth," "and their seed from among the children of men." "For they intended evil against thee," "they imagined a device, wherewith they shall not prevail." "For thou shalt make them turn their back," "thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them." "Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength," "so will we sing and praise Thy power." "Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies," "thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee." "Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace." Henrik, why did you do it? Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me?! Good God, help me! There is no God! Why did you leave me?! I believe you. It exists! Hell exists! What have you done? Who told you? Who told you? No! - He's coming now! - Calm! - Nobody's coming! - It's coming! It has started now. It's you! They're going to take you like they took your father. Don't you see? The expert of forensic medicine is on his hunting team. He killed your father, and the expert of forensic medicine covered it. Run! Olle! Now it's time to reap what some has sowed. Tonight when the lamp in the barn is lighted again... He's coming now! In fire! With the Lord's flaming sword! Help me... Help me! Are you so weak? Are you so weak that you're letting him laugh scornfully? Are you so weak that you let him murder your father and then laugh scornfully? No! No, I'll report him. Report him? What do you think that will matter? If justice is to win, you'll have to take fate into your own hands. It's time to do what you came for. It's time to revenge your father. I'll show you the way. I'll give you the tool. I'm so tired. Rest. When you awake, you shall arise in new shape. Yes, well then. Nora. Olle... Where have you been? But sit down. Who lit the light in the barn? Who lit the light in the barn? Olle, who lit the light in the barn? First I will read a psalm to you. A psalm that his father read at every church service. You'll probably remember it. It's a psalm expressing the core of the faith. It's about the enemies of God. It's about you. - It's psalm 21. - The priest shall... We'll call Lars- Erik. It's too late! The priest has asked you about calling Lars-Erik for three days, but you have declined. Because you know that he's lying! You know! If one takes the life of a God's servant one has commited a deadly sin. You know. You know, and you will get your punishment now and in all eternity. Olle... Psalm 21 goes like this: - "Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies." - It was you. - "Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace." - It was you that lit the light in the barn every night. "Make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger." There's something you need to know. There's something you don't know. "The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them." - There's something you need to know. - "The fire shall devour them." "Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed..." - Tell! - "For they intended evil against thee..." - Tell! You've misunderstood everything! - Silence! - Tell him! - "...with thy bowstrings against the face of them." Amen! Amen! Hit! Amen! Hit! Hit! Hit! He did horrible things! One aren't allowed to do so. One aren't allowed to do so. Him and me in the barn when we were reading. "The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them." "Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth," "and their seed from among the children of men." "So will we sing and praise Thy power." "Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies." "Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger." "The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath..." Amen. And it continued after the wedding. It continued after the wedding... It was a disgraceful woman. A shame. A dirty, dirty little whore. She's lying. She's lying. Lies. - Hit! Hit! Hit! - Oh, Olle. Gabriel is your father. It's strange... It strange, but I always felt that was the way it should be. And it makes it so much easier. It was my fault! There is a child there. It's not good child, so you must have felt. A damaged, horrible, evil child. - It was me that did it. - A child that killed your father. It was my fault. You and dad was in the forest. Mom was cutting my hair. Then... Then came... He talked to mom. They talked well. Then... Horneus, he... His hand... His hand... And mom...she saw... Mom talked... And mom pointed... He bent over... And mom... ...mom... ...mom... DROWNING Olle! lvar! Olle! I didn't say anything. Dad. I didn't say anything. But you told, Henrik. You told. No, I didn't. One isn't allowed to tell, Henrik. And you knew. It was our little secret. Our little, little secret. That mom wasn't supposed to know. It was between the two of us. Between the two of us. - But I didn't say nothing. - Henrik, she did know. Confess now, Henrik. It's better that way. - Henrik, do you know what happends when one tells? - No. Henrik, I've told you many times. What happends when one tells, is that one has to be punished. Punished hard. For a very long time. Very long time. Forgive me! Dad...forgive me! It's too late. Henrik, it doesn't help that you've been standing there preaching, pretending that the punishment is just an idea. You cannot lie away the Sword of Truth. The lies will get you. You can't joke away the Day of Judgement. When God shows you His face of anger, will you understand how gruesome a God he is. I cannot believe in a God that is less merciful than myself. You're just making it worse for yourself. You have to be thrown down. Now. Down into the dark abyss from which noone returns. Down into the lake that burns of fire and sulfur. Down...into hell. Oh God! Oh God! He can't help you now. It's a completely different power that you will meet. You will meet yourself. My boy. My pretty, pretty boy. It's here. We found you on the floor in the kitchen last night. Dad carried you up. How are you? Yes... Lars-Erik Niskala. Expert on forensic medicine in Hammerdal. - The priest will meet at the assembly? - Yes. Ajna want to say something. "It leads your way through life," he said. We used to sit here and read. Your father would have wanted that someone believing in it should have it. Yes, after all it does say some good things as well. The topic of today's sermon is possibly a little... ...unorthodox. Maybe. The last week has been... The last week has been a bit odd for me. But I sleep a lot better now. I sleep better than I've done in a long time. I dream different dreams. Good dreams. I dream about a world without shame and without blame. Do not judge, so you will not yourself become judged. A carpenter's son from Nazareth once said this. But what does the religions do? What does the Churches do? The way I see it, religions exist for one reason only. In order to repress the people. To scare the serving classes into obedience. So they will not dare to challenge the privileges of the elite. And the elite, ladies and gentlemen, are you. You never had sin and shamed beaten into you. The elite, that has always been sitting in this church, not in some country church, has never needed to listen to sermons about hell. What is he saying? At the end of the 1800s, when one wanted dedemonise the church, arch bishop Sundberg said "Yes". "But a peasant hell will always be needed." "A peasant hell will always be needed." - Is he joking? - The one with the power defines what's moral in the name of the Holy Lord. But noone, noone, has monopoly on God! I told you last week, I don't know if you remember, but I said that there is no hell. But I was wrong. I was wrong. There is a hell. I know now. Oh, yes, there is a hell. In the religions. There was no hell until religions. The religions invented hell. - Now he'll have to pull himself together. - Do not judge, so you will not yourself be judged. So said the Son of Man! And still this is what the church has been doing for 1700 years! - 1700 years... - What is he saying? ...of torture, execution, crusades, blood, fire, violence and abuse! John wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians: "The one that does not love, remains in death." This is the Law! This is the Answer! - Now he'll pull himself together! - No! Silence server the power! The only way in which to defend oneself from the silence is to tell the truth. The truth will set you free! The truth, and love! The endless, unconditional love. This is the only God that I have left. Down! Down! Certain people don't agree with me. But I think it is a good God. It's a God that I would want to be. Out! Out. Out of the House of God! Praise the Lord in heaven... Praise Him in height... Praise Him, all of His angels... Praise Him, all of His army... Praise Him, sun and moon... Praise Him, all shining stars... Praise Him, you heaven of heaven, you water over the sky... They shall praise His name, for He commanded their creation... He gave them their place in eternity. Decided an orden that will never perish. Yours is the day. Yours is the night. God's river is full of water. You take care of the earth, give it rain, make it fertile and rich. You make the seeds grow, water the fields. Where you pass forth grows fat crops. The grazes of the wasteland goes fertile. The heights dress in rejoicing. The fields are adorned with flocks of sheep. The valleys are covered with seeds. Everything is rejoice and song. Everything is rejoice and song. Subtitles by catzviol 2012
