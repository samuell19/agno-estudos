MOTHER AND A GUEST Based on the short story by Ju Yo-seop Adaptation: Lim Hee-jae Director of Photography: Choi Soo-young Gaffer: Lee Gye-chang Art: KANG Sung-bum Music:Jeong Yoon-joo Mother: Choi Eun-hee I(Ok-hee):Jeon Young-sun Guest: Kim Jin-kyu Grandmother: Han Eun-jin Maid: Do Geum-bong Egg Seller: Kim Hee-gap Uncle: Shin Young-kyun Fortuneteller: Huh Jang-kang Director: Shin Sang-ok This is my painting of our town. You can see the church, a kindergarten and a middle school. Look! There is a river too. Isn't it pretty? There are many small houses all over the town. And one of them is my house! That's my house. WIDOW'S HOUSE That's my house. WIDOW'S HOUSE WIDOW'S HOUSE People call it a widow's house. I don't know what 'widow' means. So I asked grandma... She says I don't have a father while others have. That's why they call us the widow's. GRANDMOTHER That's why they call us the widow's. GRANDMOTHER GRANDMOTHER My grandma living with my dad's brother. The person my mom is most afraid of But I'm not scared of her. Grandma is a deacon. If she gets a scary face I sing a hymn smiling. MOTHER My mom. MOTHER MOTHER My painting doesn't show it, MOTHER MOTHER but she's the prettiest in the world. I'm a widow's daughter so it makes my mom a widow. My father passed away one year after she married him. A month before my birth. Maybe that's why... I've never seen my mom laughing out loud. FATHER laughing out loud. FATHER FATHER I haven't met my father in person. FATHER FATHER He taught at the middle school here. Heard that he was a great person. It's the picture of him. I don't know why mother of my mom says to put it away whenever she visits us. AUNTIE MAID says to put it away whenever she visits us. AUNTIE MAID AUNTIE MAID Our maid. AUNTIE MAID AUNTIE MAID She's a widow too just like my mother. She's a widow too just like my mother. She works well, eats well, sleeps well and she's got a warm heart. They say she's the happiest one at our house. But I don't know what 'happy' means. ME But I don't know what 'happy' means. ME ME I'm a 6-year-old maiden. I am Lim Ok-hee and go to the kindergarten. Later! Get chicks! For healthy soup! Get fresh eggs, too! Hello, chicken! Good chicks. - Ok-hee! - Mom! Welcome home. They are newly hatched chicks? Yes, please pick one. - Want to buy eggs? - No. We don't need any. Be my first customer for today. Please pick one. Please, madame! Chicks! For healthy soup! - I hate bean sprouts. - Chicks! Eggs! Let's go this way. Eggs! Get fresh eggs. Hey! You! We've got eggs. Don't need any! What? I said I don't need eggs! Are you a blind or what? Can't you see what you've done? You should've watched out! What did you say? What the... Rabbit dear. Where are you going now? Hopping, hopping here and there. Where are you going now? Oh, brother! How are you? Ok-hee! How's the kindergarten? - Hello. - Is everyone well? This is Mr. Han. I've told you. She's mother of brother Kyung-seon. I see. How do you do? You've come a long way. Sorry to cause you inconvenience for a while. No way. Please make yourself at home. And that's my sister. Ok-hee! Come and say hello. - Go ahead. - You're so cute. - She is... - Yes, Kyung-seon's daughter. You look like your father. Come here. Ok-hee! Say hello. What's with you? You're a big girl now, behave like one. - Greet him properly. - Yes. He's old friend of your father's. He'll be staying at the guest room. Greet him now. Good girl. - I greeted the guest. - Good. He looks kind, doesn't he? You silly girl. Let's go to your room. Hope you'd like it. Ok-hee's mom cleaned it. I just loved him at first sight. So we became close from the first day. He's got lots of picture books. When I go to his room to play he shows the books holding me on his lap. Sometimes he gives me sweets and kisses me. You want this book, Ok-hee? - Really? - Keep it. - No thank you. - What is it? Mom will scold me. It's okay. It's my present. Thank you. Instead, I will ask mom to cook something delicious for you. - You shouldn't. - Why not? I'll show it to mom. - Be careful. - Don't worry. Gosh! You should behave, don't make a fuss. You're always scolding me! It would give him a bad impression. No way. He gave me the picture book saying he likes me. Look! - He even kissed me. - What? Who's making a fuss here? - Did he really give it to you? - Yes! We can go and ask him! Mister! - It's me again. - Come in. It's not much. But please help yourself. - Why don't you join me? - No. - Mom will hate it. - Then excuse me. Yes, please. You must be hungry. - Eat eggs! - I will. What's your favorite food? - Boiled eggs! - Really? How about you? Well, I like boiled eggs too! Wow, just like me! Really? I'll tell mom to give you lots of boiled eggs. Don't do that. - Mom! - What's in your hand? Mr. Han likes the boiled eggs best! Why took his food? I said no, but he insisted. And he asked me to tell you he likes boiled eggs like I do! Good lord! Help yourself. Chicks for healthy soup! Fresh eggs! Is she home? Why don't you buy some eggs? - We won't - Please. No one to eat it! Go away! - You have hard feelings for me? - What? Don't despise me, Mrs. Sung-hwan. We're exactly even on a social scale. So don't be mean to me. How can we be even? Of course, we can! When you're a widow, and I'm a widower. Remember? I did nothing but smiling when you splashed the water all over me. So what? Nothing. I'm just telling you. It doesn't matter if you buy eggs or not. How dare you touch me? Go away! - Right now! - Okay, I will. What a pervert! - Wasn't it the egg seller? - Yes, ma'am. Why did you kick him out without asking me? Go get him. Who would be eating eggs? The guest likes the eggs. - Buy a dozen or two. - Yes, ma'am. Chicks and eggs! - Chicks and eggs! - Wait, egg seller! Are these fresh? Let me see if they've gone bad. Don't shake it. It'll go bad. You should pay me back if these are not fresh. I'll never cheat anyone. Especially you. - You mean it? - Sure. Don't worry. I'm reliable. Then two dozen of big and fresh ones. You buy that much all of a sudden? It's for our guest. What guest? He's weird enough to like the boiled eggs only. A strange taste, indeed. Would be perfect if he likes chicken. Who does cooking and laundry for you when you live alone? - Myself, of course! - Is that so? Pathetic, but I don't get pessimistic. I've got a house and some savings. And I work everyday like this. No reason to be gloomy. - Mrs. Sung-hwan. - Yes? Why don't you introduce me a widow? You're asking a widow to introduce another widow? You want me to die out of anger? I'm done. - Are you? - Yes. Let me see. You're better than me. What are you looking at? Nothing. There's mom! It's her, right? Mom! Mom! You've got your father's nose. And you've got your mother's eyes and lips. Haven't you? Your mother is pretty like you, isn't she? Haven't you seen my mother yet? Of course, she is pretty! Prettiest in the world! Yes, she's the prettiest! How do you know when you haven't seen her! I'll introduce her when we get home. - No, you shouldn't. - Why not? Just no. - You sleep with your mom? - Yes. Why are you afraid her? She is not a scary person. - For me, she is. - You're a coward. She's the scariest person for me. Then I will ask her not to make a scary face to you. How come you have hairs on your leg? Because I'm a grown-up. But my mom has none! Look! There goes a train. Salute! Look, there comes Ok-hee with her father. Hi Ok-hee! Where have you been to? - Over there. - Where? - The hill. - For what? To paint! Like you know how to draw. - I do, right mister? - Sure. - He's not your father? - Let's go. Seems like she doesn't have father. She surely doesn't. I told you to clean the room. What are you doing? Laundry... - Come out, I'll do it. - Yes, ma'am. I wish you were my father. You should not say such a thing! Mom! Why are you crying? - Mom. - What is it? - Mr. Han... - What about him? He... You must've heard a word for not behaving. He cursed me when I said I wished he were my father. - He's such a liar! - Why do you say that? He said I've got father's nose and your eyes and lips. And asked if you are pretty just like me. - Did he? - Yes. But he's never seen you or dad, so it's all lie! Lower your voice. He will hear you. - He spoke ill of you. - What did he say? You're the scariest person in the world! Scarier and fiercer than a tiger! Did he? Today is Sunday. I go to church with grandma and mom. But Mister is a sleepyhead. On every Sunday, he sleeps until noon. I decided not to play with him but I've changed my mind feeling pity for him. What if he's still mad at me and ignore me? Where are you going, Ok-hee? I won't talk to you! You'll get dumb if you don't. I won't. Please forgive me just once. - You won't get angry again? - I won't. Where are you going today? To church with mom and grandma! Are you? You want me to take you too? - Ok-hee. - Yes? Let's go. Don't go anywhere and look out for our house! Stop it! Mr. Han! - Do you like him that much? - You don't like him? Tell me! - I like him if you like him. - I knew it! - I'll tell him! - Don't do that. - Hello. - How was the sales? Bad. You want a few dozen? - Yes, come tomorrow for money. - Don't worry. - Is the lady away? - She went to church. - The guest is away, too? - Yes. So you're alone. Did you eat too much? Not that much... I've got healing hands so let me. Hands off me! How dare you! Wait! Stay still. How's it? Feeling better? A little bit... maybe. You must! These are healing hands! Don't hit too hard! My chest! I think you need a full-scale treatment. How is it? - Feeling better? - Well... - How's it? - How dare you! Why touch there when I've got an upset stomach? You should heal from the bottom to soothe the pain in the chest. You feel much better, right? My chest! It's killing me! You should lie down. I'll rub your chest. You must have acute indigestion. Don't move. Lie still. Hey you! Why do you put your hands inside? Have you thought about my proposition? What proposition? See! The hiccups stopped! It got digested! Thanks to my healing hands! Guess you are right! Jesus Christ is the gift from God... While everyone is listening to the preach, I get so bored. So I look around to see if Mr. Han is here. And there he is! God loves even the sinners. But he doesn't love the sin. - God hates the sin. - Mister! He's really strange. I called him as I was glad to see him. He ignores me. And mom is strange, too. She scolds me all blushing. Mr. Han is also very upset. So funny. I don't understand them. Stop it. And look now! She even hits me! I don't know why everyone is mad at me. Why are you crying? Stop crying! I said stop! If you want to cry, go out! In Jesus' name we pray, Amen. Auntie! Open the door! Open it! Oh god! Lady is returning. - Open the door! - Is the service already over? I'm coming! Hurry! Use the back door! Auntie! Don't forget what I told you. - I don't know, I'm yours now. - Yes, trust me. - Hurry! - Open the door! Coming! Open the door! Opening now. Ok-hee? Why are you alone? Where is your mom? - She hit me! - Oh gosh! - That's why you cried. - You don't need eggs? Give me a few dozen of fresh and big ones. Such a cute girl. You must be a good kid. Don't buy the eggs! Why not? I hate mom and Mr. Han. Don't buy them! So adorable little one. I won't buy any. I promise. I'll excuse myself. So long. I'll wait for you. I will come often. - Have a good sales! - Thanks. The more I think, the more I feel resentful. I wish I had father just like other kids. If I could tell my father to scold them for me. I would feel great. So I thought of an idea... to play a trick on mother. Ok-hee! That kid needs some discipline! What an embarrassment at the holy church? - Mrs. Sung-hwan. - Yes, ma'am. Where is Ok-hee? Well... She was in the living room just now. She came home crying saying you hit her. Why is your skirt inside out? Gosh! - You took a nap again. - No way. It's going to rain. Go cover the crocks. Crocks. Ok-hee! Come out now. Strange. - She's not there? - No. Is she at the guest room again? Ok-hee! Ok-hee! Weird. - She's not there? - No. The guest might've taken her out. He was at the church and left with us. Then where should she be? Did Ok-hee come home? Sure! Then where is she now? She might be hiding to play with us. Ok-hee! Ok-hee! Ok-hee! Come out if you are hiding. Ok-hee! Where did she go? Ok-hee! Have you seen Ok-hee? No. What is it? Her mother sent her home for not behaving at church. She disappeared after she came back home. She might be at her friend's. Maybe... I checked almost everywhere... What if she fell into the well? Why do you say such an omnious thing? Have you checked her kindergarten? I haven't but, no reason for her to go there as no one is there. So? She's nowhere to be found. What shall we do? It's already been 5 hours. Something must've happened. Guess we should report to the police. - You're right. - I'll do it. Don't worry too much. I will go check on the kindergarten. Ok-hee! Ok-hee! - Have you seen Ok-hee? - No. - Ok-hee! - Don't look back! - Have you seen Ok-hee? - No, ma'am. Ok-hee! Ok-hee! How was it, mother? She didn't come to the kindergarten. - No news from Mr. Han? - Not yet. She must've met the trouble. Something very serious. Please compose yourself. She will turn up unless she's dead. Ok-hee, poor thing. Isn't this Ok-hee crying? - What? - Listen! I'm not sure. It's coming from the main bedroom. Ok-hee! Oh dear! My little girl. She was sleeping in the attic! You wicked one! You want your mother to die? I'm sorry mom. Don't hit her. Please forgive me. I won't do it again, mom. - Ok-hee! - Mom! Spring has gone and Summer is here. It's been quite a while since he came to our house. The egg seller comes everyday. And mother never forgets to serve the boiled eggs to Mr. Han. How are you? You dressed up! What is it? Going on a blind date? My lonely days will be over soon. I hope you don't bite the dust like the previous time. I'm confident this time. I found the perfect widow. Good looking and an excellent homemaker. She will definitely bear the healthy child, too. Good to hear. I'm meeting her today. So I was wondering... if I could borrow your watch. My watch? I'll return it safe. I promise. Of course, you can borrow it. But this watch stops often. Will it be okay? It's for fashion not for checking time. You've got a point. You're seeing someone, aren't you? Nonsense! My brother came to town to sell a cow so I'm meeting him. Here it is. Thank you. I'll return it safe. It would look weird to walk separate like this. Let's walk like a couple. Why act like a couple when we are not one? Why do you keep looking at me? - Isn't this scarf nice? - Really nice. You're such a smart dresser. How much did you pay? - For this? - Must be a lot. It's already past noon. - You must be hungry. - No. Shall we go to a restaurant? - You hungry? - Yes. I prepared the lunchbox. Then let's go somewhere quiet. Go ahead. I don't like eggs. You eat them. - Help yourself. - No you eat it. - I am okay. - Listen to me. - People will see us! - Eat it for your health. - No! Oops. - You're too stubborn. What a waste. - Give it to me. - Lift your foot. - Give it to me. - Lift it, please. - Your foot! - What foot? Lift your foot. I'm sorry. What is it? Having an upset stomach again? No, I'm not. Those damn healing hands got me into this! My healing hands? What did they do? Don't have any clue? Tell me, what clue? I'm pregnant. The thing on that day got us the baby? Really? Don't ask me. Are you sure? It is my baby, right? Then whose baby would it be? - What shall we do? - Why worry? Perfect, let's get married! Let's live happily ever after with our baby! My darling! One day, I picked some flowers at kindergarten, to please my mother. She loves flowers. Then I wanted to play tricks seeing her happy. - Aren't they pretty? - Where did you get them? Mr. Han isn't home yet? Mom, the truth is... these are from Mr. Han at the guest room. What? He asked me to bring them to you. - Are you angry again? - No way. Did he really tell you to give these to me? Yes. - You are not supposed to receive these. - Why not? Listen to your mother. - Ok-hee. - Yes? Don't tell anyone about the flowers. Why not? Just don't. Okay? - Not even to grandma? - No. - I'll go get the vase. - Yes. I never expected mom to get angry receiving the flowers she adores. To see her get mad, I thought I did a right thing to lie that the flowers were from Mr. Han. Mom is really strange today. She's never touched the piano since my father passed away. What made her play it now? Excuse me, Ok-hee is... Oh gosh. I didn't want to wake her up. Mister. What brought you here? You never come out. I was at the market. Why don't you come in? Come! - How's the business? - Not good. Thanks to people like you sticking to the old style. You did our maid's hair, didn't you? - Yes, isn't it nice? - Not really. I heard some good news about you. What? What did you hear? - Tell me the truth, prude. - What truth? I heard you get along well with your guest. - What? - I knew it! Nonsense! Who told you that? Your face shows it! Stop it! It's disgraceful! Your problem is this. Time's changed. Widows can get married again. You can get married as many as you want if it can make you happy. Don't worry about me. Think about your life. It's simple for you as you don't have a kid. I should quit this business and get married! You have someone, don't you? It's between you and me. Don't tell anyone. - What do you think? - Oh, gosh. And who is a prude now? He's a widower with a kid, and really into me. - Really? - Give it back. Jung-sook! Let's get brave from now on. To start, let me cut your hair short. No way. Come sit here. - It's not about the hair. - In a way, it is. If you cut your hair your old-fashioned point of view will be changed! Would it? Come here, madame! I will tell everything about your fortune! Come. No one would hear us. By face reading or astrology? By astrology. Year and date of your birth, please. I'm 28 years old. Born at 5 am on May 5th. Let me see... age 28. May 5th, 5 am. Please raise your face and look this way? Raise your head, please. And turn this way. You've got a noble feature. Let me see your hand. This is the life line. And it's the emotional line. Good. Now, please allow me... Really nice. You're born with a superb fate. But as I shouldn't lie to you, forgive me saying this to you. Please go ahead. You're destined to lose your first husband. What do you say? - Did I see it right? - Yes. But you have good days ahead. Even though you're lonely at present, wind will melt the ice and an old tree will see the spring when someone noble comes from the north-east soon. Thanks to this noble man, you will become happy enjoying all the wealth and prosperity. Trust me. I see you already have someone in your mind. Don't you? If you do, tell me honestly. It'd help me read your fortune more clearly. I'm sure there's one. Tell me, please. It's okay for now. How much is it? Even though she watered them everyday those flowers withered. Mom took petals and put them inside her hymn book. She still thinks those are from Mr. Han! She would think that way until her death if I don't tell her the truth. One day, the funny thing happened. You know the maid at the widow's... People say our maid got pregnant. So people in the village started talking how the widow got pregnant. I don't understand. Why is it wrong for a widow to get pregnant? So strange. Then is it why my mom doesn't give a birth, either? - Are you in? - Hello. Is Mr. Han home? - Not yet. - Let's get in. You should let the maid out right away. And Mr. Han too. This is too scandalous. What is it, mother? That cunning bitch got pregnant! Pregnant? Heard that it's been already 4 months. The whole village knows it. Whose baby can it be? Mr. Han's, of course! It must be. He arrived 4 months ago. See? I knew it. Mrs. Sung-hwan! Wake up. Let me hear your thought. Is Mr. Han really the father? There's no smoke without a fire. Even if he's not involved, this kind of rumor itself is a humiliation to our family. I'm worried about Ok-hee, if I let him leave... But I can't let those shameless people stay at my house and feed them. You can't see through the people's minds. Who knows? He might do you a harm! So do as I tell you. Did you hear that? The guest got a maid pregnant? That's what I've heard. Someone even saw them together! The lady got him eggs everyday but the maid got him! So funny! - Here he comes. - Where? Him, right there. Bastard. It's none of your business. Just sit back and enjoy the spectacle. - Let's get back to work. - Sure. You will catch a cold doing that! I won't. Don't need eggs. Go away. - And don't come again! - I see. Mr. Han, are you in? Can I talk to you for a minute? Please, come in. So it's true. How dare she cheated on me! I'll tear you into pieces! Are you there? Answer me. It's me! Come here! I didn't know you are such a filthy bitch. - What is it? - What? Tell me the truth. Whose baby is it, really? - What are you talking about? - I heard it all! You got someone else's seed and told me it's mine? You bitch! Tell me the truth! I'm speechless. Someone else's seed? I am about to being kicked out because of you! I get it. You're doing this as you don't want me now? I'm so pissed. All men are thieves. What shall I do now? Poor me. Someone else's seed? I just don't know what to say. So it is not true? Tell me the truth! The baby is really mine? I don't know! I'll throw myself into the well and die! I'm sorry. It's my fault. - Are you awake? - Yes. What brought you here? It's quite late. Mother We almost made a huge mistake. What mistake? The maid. The father was the egg seller. The egg seller? The egg seller who comes everyday. Is that so? She was all smiles whenever he came. I see why now. What a shame. I'm relieved we found out before Mr. Han knew about this. You are right. Then can we let him stay? The house feels too big and Ok-hee likes him so much. Please let him stay. No, you should let him go. Some bad rumors can spread with a man staying at a young widow's. It could ruin your reputation. My mother-in-law died as widow, and so will I. But it's quite difficult to remain faithful. Mom, have you seen Mr. Han's painting of your face? What? Did he draw my face? It looks exactly same. Especially the eyes! Don't talk about him anymore. Why not? You hate him now as he doesn't pay the rent? Yes, I hate him so much so I'll kick him out. I feel pity for him. Ok-hee! If you keep talking about him, I will run away alone leaving you with him. No! Then Ok-hee, promise me not to talk about him anymore. I promise! Good. Let's go. Mom, there goes Mr. Han! Mr. Han! Where have you been? - Grandma's. - I see. Let's go. - Mr. Han! - Yes. - Mom's angry. - Why? Because you didn't pay the rent. She hates you and will kick you out. You're in trouble. But don't worry. I'll break my piggy box and pay for you. And mom said she would run away if I talk about you. Gosh! - She's strange, isn't she? - You can live with me. Who will cook and do the laundry? - I can do it. - No way. - Can you cook? - Sure. Mom! Mr. Han said if you run away I can live with him. Ok-hee! What I told you about kicking him out was a lie. Really? I'm so happy. Mister! Mom just said that kicking you out if you don't pay the rent was a lie. - Really? - Mom is good at lying. I will never know what's on your mom's mind. I've got a headache. - Me, too. - Let me see. It's very hot! - Right? - Aren't you cold? - Yes. - What is it? Mom, I have a headache. Are you ill? Let me carry you. - Want to be on my back? - Yes. That night, I was burning up with a fever. I even said strange things. But I thought mom deserved this as she didn't let me go to the guest room. Mom! Yes, I'm here. Mom, I'm not sick. Let me play with Mr. Han in his room. She's not herself. Finally he's coming. Yes. - Sorry to call you late at night. - No way. Doctor is here. She was okay after dinner. Then suddenly she got cold sweat and burned up. We fed her salt thinking she got an upset stomach. The fever is very high. She played too hard today. Mr. Han! Ok-hee, I'm here. I am not sick. I want to play in your room! Yes, get well soon. Mom doesn't let me go to your room. Dear Jesus, our life, who is in control of our life and death. Please listen to the low voice humbly asking for your grace. Sister. Brother, what brought you here? Heard that Ok-hee's ill. How is she? She's fine now. She had an acute indigestion. Mr. Han had to bring the doctor at night. Your mother-in-law must've been surprised. How is your family? We're well. I was going to your house as there is something to talk to you. What is it? Let's go somewhere quiet. Who said that? Such a disgrace! We don't need to listen to that nonsense and I hadn't thought it that way. But I guess there must be rumors with a young man staying at a widow's house. - What do you think? - Think what? About Mr. Han. There is nothing to think about. Do you really want to spend your life like this? You lost your husband right after you got married, and went through hardships since then. I've never thought of my life that way. I feel lonely at times as I'm still young. But I've got Ok-hee. I understand your feelings. But I just can't let you live like this. If a woman passes 30, no one gets attracted. So think about getting married before you get too old. Your late husband would think like me if he had truly loved you. You need to pursue your own happiness yourself. You know the situation I am in, brother. Right. You can't scratch your own back. I'll talk to Ok-hee's grandmother tonight. What do you want me to do? I don't know... But I can guess she must be quite frustrated. So I hope she can come to us and stay for a while. You want to take her for good or for a while? Well... that's... I see your point. You want to take her to get her re-married. But she came under my wings when she's married to my son. To get her re-married or not should be my call. It's not appropriate for you to talk about it. Don't you think so? I'm quite displeased! I am not making her get married right away. I can't allow it. But if she wants it, how can I stop her? What about Ok-hee? I guess her mother should raise her until reaches certain age. No! Over my dead body! The house feels so empty after auntie maid left. And mother doesn't talk much, smile nor eat much. She only keeps sighing. And Mr. Han is also angry and hardly talks. Come in. What is your mom doing? She must be lonely as the maid left. So she doesn't talk or laugh. And doesn't eat much. She only sighs. Why did she leave? Grandmother kicked her out as she hates her eating too much. I eat a lot, too. What if I get kicked out? - Don't worry, you got me. - How so? I can give you my food without telling anyone! - What if she still wants me out? - I will go with you! How about your mom? Mom... Who do you like better? Me or mom? I like you both! Ok-hee Give it to your mom. - It's rent for the last month. - I see. - Don't let grandma see it. - Okay. Mom, Mr. Han said this is for you. - Last month's rent. - Okay. - What is it? - Nothing. Ms. Lee, I will leave this house... as you asked. But I can never let you leave from my heart, a place now fully seized by you. I love you. Now I realize I love you. I need to confess this even if this might be wrong as I'm certain and proud of my love for you. I won't say much. This is all I want to say. I'm sleepy. Let's go to bed. Okay. Let's sleep. - Welcome. - Hello. How is she? - Got better from yesterday. - I see. Welcome. How are you feeling? I'm okay. I called you in because... I have talked with your brother. My feelings got hurt first so I said no to him right away that day. But I thought it over after he left. The dead ones are the poor ones. But you're bound to live your life. The world has changed and now calls us fools for remaining faithful. How can I stay stubborn and ruin your future? You should live your own life. It's just that although having met as in-laws, we became so close and intimate. I just feel sad and lonely thinking you would be out of my life. That's all. I will be happy to see you living happily with a good man. You're a kind and diligent girl, so you would be well off wherever you go. Hope you meet someone nice and live well. And visit me sometimes. For Ok-hee, do as you wish whether to taker her or leave her here. Mother. My girl. Mom! What are you doing? - Are you sick? - No. Why are you crying then? Go sleep. - You too. - Okay. - We need to pray. - You're right. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, And lead us not into temptation, - Not into temptation... - Let me finish! but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom, and power, and the glory forever. Amen. Let's sleep. - Ok-hee. - Yes? I need no one but you. You will live with me forever, won't you? Yes. Even when I become an old lady? Yes. When you graduate kindergarten, elementary school, middle and high school. And when you become a great person after the college. You will live with your mom, won't you? - I'm not getting married? - What? The next day was Sunday. But suddenly mom said she was sick, and didn't go to church. And in her bed, she kept writing and tearing something. She's got really strange recently. That night, she combed my hair, put ribbons and new clothes on me. - Are we going somewhere? - No. This is Mr. Han's. Go give it back to him. Yes. Come back soon. Don't stay long! I won't. - Hello! - Yes. You're dressed up. What's the occasion? This is yours. Mom told me to give you. Did she? Dear Mr. Han, don't put the fire on the barren tree. What if it starts to burn up? The thought of it horrfies me. Ok-hee is all I have. I can't do anything about my unfortunate destiny. If you love someone like me, please forget me. Mom! Has it run dry? Or have I gone mad? The next day, the maid and the egg seller visited us. I found out later, that the maid married the egg seller. I guess they get happy when get married. - Ok-hee! - Auntie! - Doing well? - Yes. - Your mom's well? - Yes. Good. Madame and lady! - How have you been? - Welcome. What brought you here? We got married. Oh, you did! I wanted to do it after I saved some money. But the baby came along with a one time fling... so we did it simple before her belly gets too big. - Come on up. - Yes. Sit down. It's not the first marriage for both of us but it feels so much fun as if this were our first time. - Good for you. - Right? Of course. Honey, don't forget about it. - Oh, yes. - What is it? It's not much... but we brought some food from our wedding. You didn't have to! - Ok-hee. - Yes? - Take that. - I'll do it. - Give it to me. - No, you go up. She always says you are like her family. - Why didn't you invite us? - It was really a simple one. Mom! A guest from Seoul! From Seoul? A pretty lady. Excuse me. Mr. Han Sun-ho is staying here, right? Yes, and who are you? I'm his sister. Our mother has been sick for three years and is in a critical condition. So I came to get him. You will forget me soon after I am gone? No! Really? - Mom! - Yes? Is he really leaving? Why don't you go with him? Really? Yes. - Then what about you? - Me? I will get married. Then I'll get married too following you! Don't be silly. Go go get all the eggs from the shelf. Eggs? Thank you for everything. Take care. It was my pleasure. What are they doing? Ok-hee, come out and say good-bye. Take care, Ok-hee. These are from mom, for you to eat on the train. Don't cry. I'll be back. - Mom, he's gone! - Yes. Why do you cry? He said he would be back. Rabbit dear. Where are you going now? Hopping, hopping here and there... Ok-hee! Shall we climb the hill? Yes. Okay. Mom! The train is here! It's leaving! Mister! Mister! He's gone. Mom, let's go home. a SHIN FILM production, 1961 Subtitles translation support Literature Translation Institute of Korea Subtitles Translation: EJ CHO Proofreading: LIM Jiyoon
