Scenes of horror in the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. Scores of videos posted on the Internet show something terrible has happened here. The footage cannot be verified, but experts have told the BBC that these appear to be symptoms of poisoning by chemical agents. The victims, many of them children, appear to be struggling to breathe. There's almost no blood, but many are dead or dying. If this is found to have been a chemical attack, it's likely to have consequences for the future of Syria's war. The West will have to look even harder at its decision not to get more involved at a conflict... Are you okay? Stupid kid. May I? I'm a doctor. It's just a minor scrape, really. Don't worry, doctor. I'm sorry, I didn't see you brake. Yes. Yes, but we should... exchange insurance details. Angela Caroni. Pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. Simon Bell. Can I help you? No, it's... it's nothing. It's nothing, really. It's just a... It's just, you... you raised my blood pressure. Now I'm sure you have a concussion. I'm taking you straight to the hospital. You are most welcome to come visit my store in Brussels. It's quite wonderful. Thank you. One baklava. Just the way you like it, my dear Simon. For you, sidi, a lovely kanafeh with extra pistachios. Anne-Marie's gonna love it. Nineteenth-century. Victorian. Exactly the sort of thing she's into, right? It's beautiful. I'm sure Anne-Marie will love it. So, how much you said it was? - Are you joking? - Don't start. It's her birthday present. I swear, I haven't a clue. It's been in the store for ages, I never wanted to part with it. But for you... anything. So what have you got for me? I don't know much. But I think the woman will lead you to it. You just have to make her trust you. General. We gave up our arsenal a few years ago. Even if we have them, we wouldn't use them. And we have never used our chemical, uh, arsenal, uh, in our history. So what happened? As I said, the only source is Al Qaeda, we cannot, uh, take it seriously. But our impression... Oh. To what do I owe this extraordinary pleasure? Avram, we have a code red situation. It's about General Nader. The boss is here. He wants to talk to you. I don't understand what happened. Do we know where they're keeping him? Do they smuggle him back to Damascus? We don't know yet. - Poor man. - Yeah. How long has it been since the general pointed you in the direction of the woman from Viro? - What's her name? - Angela. - Two weeks. - Well... Wouldn't it make more sense that their old friends try to take you out? Why the rush to take him out? Forty years on the job, I don't go looking for sense anymore. Nor do I. Why do you think I came all the way over here? Because of the general? No, it's you. What kind of bullshit are you trying to spit me, huh? I always shit what's bullshit, Avram. I really do. But you've been lying to us. The general said nothing to offer for a while now. So you, you just went and started making things up. Me and Pe'er are going to escort you tomorrow morning to Israel. There will be an investigation. A tough one. I already told you this a couple years back. It's time to call it a day. Spend some years in the sun. You know as well as I do... how limited our window of opportunity is before these biological weapons fall into the wrong hands. There's so many wrong hands out there, and you wanna give it all up just because you no longer trust your number one man. Can you live with that? Can the Prime Minister live with that? This woman is our best lead in years. I just need some more time to make her trust me. Then she'll give me everything we need. You have to give me this chance. Bye. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We'll shortly arrive at Brussels International Airport. Inspect your check-in time and check-out schedule. Thank you. The best book ever written about the single most fascinating war in mankind's history. I was always fascinated by the character of Russia's Minister for War, Vladimir Sukhomlinov. It turns out he had the hots for this young girl who's married to a Russian army officer. Sukhomlinov's best friend and confidant was this Austrian guy. What did they do? Pinned some bogus charges on the officer. Poor officer had to get a divorce. In two seconds, Sukhomlinov married the girl. Later, it turns out the Austrian guy was the Austria-Hungarian Empire's greatest spy in Russia. Fascinating story. Fascinating. It's my wife's. I've already read the book twice. So, I won't leave any surprises anyway. Well, I hope the hero doesn't die at the end. It always make me sad. No, no, no. it's a happy ending. Don't you worry. Okay. So now, I don't have to read it. Simon Bell. Ruud van der Veen. Heading back home? Amsterdam? Rotterdam. - It's been a long week. - Indeed. How about a drink, then? Sure. Let me just make a quick jog to the gents' and I'll join you in a minute. - Yes? - Yes. Stay right here. - Samuel's orders. - What? To get in my way? I get off at Rotterdam. That's where I'm meeting her. So, if you'll excuse me... We have a week to spend together, so... A week, eh? Suppose I need an extra day... or two, what then? Off to jail anyway? I won't let them dump me in some cell and throw away the key. I won't be Prisoner X. My god. You're as strong as your father was. I'm glad you're here, Daniel. But I'm really sorry you got stitched up in this goo. You deserve better than being a babysitter. Pity about you quitting university. I hear you're quite the mathematical genius. Come now. Let me pee in peace. That's one out of the way. What the fuck are you doing? Ladies and gentlemen, Rotterdam terminus. In a few minutes, we'll be stopping into Roosendaal station. Roosendaal station is next. Fuck. We gotta get out of here. Stop! Stop! Stop! Jump! Stop! What the fuck were you thinking? If you're a literary man, you'd know that Justin Quayle gets beaten to death at the end of the novel. Didn't you at least see the movie? It's a good one. God is in the details, Daniel. It's the fine print. It will bite you in the ass if you don't stop and read it. That's what I always tell my recruits. I'm not one of your recruits. Okay. We'll... We'll go that way, get some wheels and take it from there. Actually, I wanted to do the opposite. That's exactly what they expect us to do. I'm sure they've already set up roadblocks. I've been waiting for hours. Where are you? That cannot be. Look at all these waste of human life, Daniel. So much blood. And for what? Listen, kid. There are a lot of people out there who'd do anything to stop me from exposing the truth. Viro works for whoever pays them more. This case, the Syrians are paying millions to build up their biological arsenal. Bullshit. Our intel shows no sign that Viro is involved. They know nothing. Trust me, I'm their only source. And I know there are Viro people in on it in their facilities in Belgium, Holland. And not only Viro. This thing runs deep. Hey, Daniel. From the day you signed up, I've been watching you from afar. Making sure you're okay. I owe it to your father. Your dad and I... Stop! - Wait. - Stop! Come. No, no, no. Oh, he'd be delighted. You know this little hotel called Winterhof? I haven't been around it for years, but... I think it's not far. I thought you were supposed to meet that woman in Rotterdam, no? Yes, yes. But that can wait. Don't worry. We're fully booked. Who's playing? Hm? Amateurs. Are you for the Castle Lords? Or the People's Club? My guess would be the Castle Lords. Am I right? I'm for the People's Club. Or was it the people? Otorongo. Johan and the Alverman. It's a great show. This Otorongo was quite a character. He was my uncle. Your uncle? That's amazing. Yeah, the poor man died years ago. I remember when... Yes! Oh. I think that deserves a drink, don't you? So, do you have a room for us? You smell like a prostitute. Thank you. So, what did Samuel tell you then? Nothing that I wanna share with you. Thank you. - Is that it? - Mm-hm. You can't go to dinner like that. Careful. It's not as innocent as it looks. Leave your passport with me. I took the liberty of ordering for us. And it smells great. Okay. You're probably thinking this is just a simple pea soup. But no. It's not simple at all. The secret lies in the ingredients and the slow cooking. And there's a test. You're supposed to be able to stand your spoon upright in a good pea soup, but... peas are not to be taken lightly. You could spend a lifetime looking for the perfect one. If Judah can see us now, both of us sitting here, he'd die. He did. You forgot. Your dad and I were the same. Same passion for life. Same drive. Same taste. We first met... Nader Khadir Abdulkhara in Bonn, Germany. Yeah, I know where Bonn is. I was born there. Yeah, I know. Anyway... He was a colonel then. And we had reason to believe that he had information about our dear friend and master spy, Isaac Leevy... who vanished in Damascus. We asked permission to recruit him, Nader, and HQ said, "No. We're on it. Stay out of it." So your dad said, "Fuck them. We're not gonna leave poor Isaac out there. Fuck them." He was something special, your dad. Nader had just finished his term in Germany. He was getting ready to leave for his next post in Brussels. We knew he loved antiques. My cover was a Brussels antiques dealer. I introduced your father, presented him as my dear friend and client, Freddy. Freddy Blaine. I figured we'd soon become fast friends, which we did. We had him in our hands. His code name was Ahab. Daniel. There are many things I could tell you. Good evening, gentlemen. I'm Anne-Marie, the owner. Have you been enjoying your time here? Simon Bell. This dinner is a true testament to Madam's exquisite taste, and, if I may say so, beauty. - It's just a pea soup. - Ah, but an exquisite one. Peas are not to be taken lightly. I could swear I've seen you somewhere before. I get that from a lot of people. I must have one of those faces. Now, if you'll excuse me... We should at least have a drink in honor of your birthday. One would have to be blind to miss your adoring fans. Spiegelau. Nice. I keep them for special occasions. But I'm not sure this one is. Come on. All birthdays are special. Mm. My god. - It's you. - Mm-hm. Wow! I was totally in love with you. A lot of men fell in love with me back then. - Women too. - Ah. But that's all in the past. Only memories are left. And they're not all that sweet. You're too young to talk like that. You're really kind. I've been meaning to ask you. What exactly brought you here in the first place? My dear. My bladder's about to burst. I'll be right back. You cannot stay here, Anne-Marie. What? So this whole charade is just so you could come here and tell me there's no point waiting for Nader? Is that what it was? I gave up so much to be with him. And I regret nothing. All these years, I kept hearing, "One day, something is going to happen. And I won't be back. But you will wait for me. You mustn't go anywhere. Because in the end, no matter what, I will be back." I was Nader's big secret. No one knew about me. If you feel anything's wrong, anything at all, call me, okay? I'll be okay. I just want Nader to be okay. Yeah. Me too. Don't forget to bring my poor car back. I left you something in Nader's black briefcase. But I don't have the code. I left it open. Let's go. You can keep on saying how weird it is 'til the Mossad comes, but it wasn't until I got off that train that I realized how close we actually were to Anne-Marie's place. I don't believe in coincidences. Not the guy on the train, not Anne-Marie. Do you believe in God? - What? - Einstein once said that, "Coincidences are God's way of keeping his anonymity." You see? Even he was a man of faith. I bet you never suspected him, hey? Are we close to the border? That's... What the fuck? Take it easy. Easy, easy, easy. - Martens. - Samuel. My agents are bringing you the old-timer and the kid. But I really can't cover up for you much more. I know, I know. - Don't worry. - Mm-hm. Listen, Martens. We would never act on Belgium solely without your permission. I never doubted that, my friend. I simply wanna make sure there are no misunderstandings. None whatsoever. How amusing. Do you have a problem? Take it up with our good friend, the State Security. Martens gave me a call and asked whether we happen to be in the middle of some assignment or operation he wasn't informed of. They were onto you the minute you boarded the train. Luckily, you didn't kill the poor guy who was tailing you. You, with me. You. Don't move. Daniel. There's a lot more stories - I can tell you about him. - Okay, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. They just love you, don't they? Oh, most of these kids I used to train, so... I know. I was one of those kids, remember? I really admired you. And now you betrayed us. - Samuel, I don't... - The conclusive result of the check we ran on how the general was handled by you over the years should be coming in really soon. I truly wanna believe that you forging the reports is only a recent thing. Okay. Now... These are the latest images from the chemical plant in Al Safir. We really tried, but we couldn't find anything. So, it's pretty damn simple. You bring us the smoking gun you've been promising, and you live. You don't deliver... Where were you yesterday? I waited for nothing. See you at seven o'clock at the restaurant. There's something I've been curious about. But you have to be honest. I'm always honest. Why me? This country's full of beautiful women. Ooh. Why you? Well... It's just that in my line of work, we have to be super sensitive about industrial espionage. I was convinced you were following me. Well, I was following you. But for other reasons. Other reasons? You make me feel... May I offer you desserts? I'm sorry, but my boss is insisting adjourning this meeting. - Is that right? - Right. I want to kill your boss. I'll do it myself. Good evening, madam. Good evening, Philip. What? I didn't tail her because I wasn't about to leave you without your back covered. Rookie's mistake. License plate of the car she got into. You should have followed them. Leaving you unattended once was more than enough, thank you. You gotta think outside the box, kid. How old are you, anyway? Old enough. And to you. My license plate number, 1-BGK-912. And, sorry? My name? Yes. Johan Slegers. What is the latest address you have for me on file? We got it. Um... 41 Van Breestrat. Yes. That's where I live. You're very kind, thank you. - Can we go now? - Yes, yes. Sorry, old-school. Can't help it. So what do we want from the Sleger's? We don't want anything. We need to find out what he's about. How? Wait. Excuse me. Uh... We're in... a bit of a jam with our car here. I was wondering, would you be so kind as to help us out with a bottle of water maybe? Ain't got none. No use, the battery's totally dead. I mean, for real. Um... A phone call, perhaps? Sorry, no can do. Comrade. Sergeant John Paul Mondong. Eleventh Paratroop Division. Battle of Kolwezi '78. Well, as I live and breathe... Private First Class Alexander Jacobs. Second Parachute Regiment. Iraq, 1991. "Every legionnaire..." "...is your brother in arms, whatever his nationality, his race, or religion might be. You show him the same close solidarity that unites the members of the same family." First five bottles in the car, we'll be saving for Michelle. My friend Alexander here is thirsty. Well, I am thirsty. Thank you, Alexander. We gotta move on. Our guys will take the car back to Anne-Marie. See you later, old chap. Daniel, how do we get back to town? I don't know, but based on these, he's nothing special, this Johan Slegers. An attorney specializing in environmental suits. It states here that Dr. Angela Caroni, is an expert witness in a lawsuit against a polluting factory in Shaqlawa. Nothing to write home about. "Nothing to write home about." Are you kidding me? It means she's totally kosher. How? Oh, come on, Daniel. Do you think the General pointed her out to me for nothing? She's a senior consultant of Viro's CEO on all matters related to toxic waste, hazardous material, and all environmental issues. Environmental protection is her soft spot. Okay. How do we benefit from it? Okay. Viro listens to her... because they know that without her thumbs up that they're clean, they'll never get the government's stamp of approval. They need her. We need them. All I have to do is to get her to need me. Easy. I never said it was easy. Yeah, but you think it is. My dear. I was just thinking about you. Oh, come on. No need to be sorry. Well, as long as he didn't keep you up too late. I'd be delighted. Tomorrow? Four o'clock? Sounds wonderful. No, no, no. Let me choose the place. Bye. So, do you have a plan? I'm working on it. Do you want to eat? Try it. Aah. Good for the soul. I love this. The eels are from the River Scheldt. And they're prepared with whatever fresh herbs they can find along the riverbank. They're all added at the last minute to preserve the green color. A bit too green for me. Well, your dad wasn't a big fan either, but he was a good sport. He faked it. The seat you're sitting in now is the exact same one he used. Is that why you brought me here? Come on, come on. Sit down. Eat. It became a tradition, us meeting here. That last time, we were both pretty much already on our way out. We delivered the intel on Isaac Leevy. The Syrians hanged him anyway. Poor guy. So, we decided to come for one last round of pale et gruit, a drop of Jenever. Your dad had this way of saying things. His head would be halfway down, only the eyes looking up at me. "Any regrets, Avram?" He asked. "Hell no," I told him. "And you?" Something wrong? You didn't like it? - Uh... - His dad didn't like it either. Like father like son. You're the brick. Is George here? I'd really love to say hello, it's uh... Tell him Simon's here with Freddy's son who is just as handsome as his father was. 'Cause it's been a long, long time since I've seen him. Sorry, he passed away five years ago. I'm his son. Were you good friends? Oh, yes. I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm really sorry to hear that. What can I say? Continuous allegations of chemical weapons in various fighting zones in Syria. Since 2014, allegations... So, based on your plan, I found this place for a good price and no questions asked. Great. Yeah, okay. I'm willing to pay six months in advance. When do you want to start? Right away. Something's on your mind? Nothing. I'm just happy. Me too. Okay, guys. Take your positions. Oh. What on earth happened here? This is organophosphate. It's an agricultural pesticide. Whoever committed this ecological atrocity literally dumped a container's worth of this stuff into the river. People everywhere will do anything for money. Not everyone. There are still good people out there. Minority. So let's agree we are part of that minority. Well, I have to think about that. I'm not so sure you are. Bastard. Of course, I am. It's what I do for a living. What's that? I try to protect people. You're blushing. That's cute. I've got the most vicious craving for this Portuguese cake. Pastel de nata, it's called. It's heaven. When did you last have it? It was in Lisbon. And it feels like a hundred years ago. What did you lose in Lisbon? Lose? Love, I guess. Love. He was an idiot. And? There is no and. Just a broken heart. May I come in? No. Who are you? Who sent you? I'm not at liberty to tell you, but... I do have a wonderful present for you. Fresh from the oven. Remember your brother-in-arms? Alexander Jacobs? - Guard from the Slegers' house? - Yes. Turns out he spent years working under Martens. Very interesting. Where'd you get this? Made some inquiries, you know. Does Samuel know? That's what you're worried about? No. Samuel doesn't know. I'll tell you what I'm worried about. I'm worried about whatever Martens is up to. Good job then, you signed up with us after all. How did your mom feel about you joining the Mossad? Mother? I had no contact with her in years. It was my grandmother who raised me back in Israel. Yeah, right. I should have known that, sorry. Sorry? English. Oh, ah. Your dad seems in top shape. Yeah, but the mind's not really there anymore, you know. Oh. It's not easy for them. It's sad. Did you notice how she was checking you out? Hm? Oh, come on, Daniel. You don't turn your back on a sure thing like that. When I was your age... I have some bad news. Shoot. It's Anne-Marie. The Syrians got to her. Ah. Wipe your hands. A week before he passed away, he couldn't talk anymore, he asked me with his hands, to fetch him that Book of Psalms from the table. Somebody's left it there at noon that day. Right, I figured. Judas finally lost it. And he starts leafing through it. Knew exactly what he was looking for. "Man is like a breath. His days are but a fleeting shadow." Coming. I just wanted to see you. Come. You make love just like you live life. Meaning? In despair. Why do you say that? Because I feel it. And I know what it's like. You... You know what it's like? I know what it's like to want your independence. And the price you pay for it. And what's that? Loneliness. Good morning. Sleep well? This is one of my last remaining indoor space. You really should have a go. Cleanses the soul. I could really use some soul-cleansing today. Yeah. It was a bad day. Let's talk. We tried real hard not to put you on the spot, but the Syrians are playing it rough. We have to respond. I've always had your back, Samuel. I'll look the other way when it was necessary, but I am about to go into early retirement, and I would like to go quietly. Better hurry, Samuel. I'll be out of cards soon. Hey! Looks good, huh? What? All of it. The offices, the logo. The boys have been working really hard to make Leptrochemicals look like a real working company. Yeah. Great. You okay? Oh, much better than okay. Pretty damn excellent, as a matter of fact. Yes? Hold on a second. Well? The prey has been trapped. Matter of days now. You look... pale. Me? No. Strong as a bone. Why? Oh, you did well last night. Thank you. Sorry, Martens. I'm with you. No worries. Things are moving fast with Angela. That's why emotions come in to play. You had to move quickly to get her emotionally attached. Intentionally, do just about anything to keep you. A couple more days, I'm going to have to kill. She's not in love with you. Why'd you say that? She just... pities you. Nonsense. I can feel her. My senses never fail me. Never. Let's go. - Wanna sit down for a second? - Maybe. You can't go on like this. I'm going to Samuel. This is nothing. And you're not saying anything to anyone. No way I'm gonna give them that satisfaction. No goddamn way. Daniel? Sit down. "We took the plunge because we chose to. No one twisted our arm into doing anything. We wanted to save a friend." This is what your father said to me. So, I said to him, "Listen. I'm the one who made all the decisions here. So, I'll just tell them that I'm the one who pushed you. Lied to you. That the bosses okayed Nader's recruitment." So... he takes a swig straight out of the bottle. And he says, "Avram, my dear... I haven't got much time." And I had no idea what he meant, so I asked him. And that's when he told me about the cancer that he'd only just found. And he swore me to secrecy. And I was crying. And he goes... "No tears, Avram. That's not, um... I'm at peace with myself. I'm happy." Hey. Not the smartest thing to leave your door unlocked. Brought you something nice. Hot tea. That's the first time in my life someone's brought me a cup of tea in bed. It's stuffy in here. How about we go out for a bit of fresh air? It'll do you good. You have to promise me something, Daniel. Don't go making the same stupid mistakes I made. It all goes by so fast. You turn your back for a minute, suddenly, everyone's gone. You're all alone. I think I'll just have a quick shower. You're a common thief and liar. If you promise to hear me out from start to finish, I'll tell you everything. If I promise? You've been conning me every step of the way, and you almost got away with it. - Daniel... - Shut up. Shut the fuck up! Do you know what my orders are? Do you? These are my fucking orders. Do you understand? These are my fucking orders! You stole the money that was meant for the general. Just admit it! Admit it! Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck! - What? - Nothing. It's just that for 40 years, you get up every morning, put on a mask, and got and con people. And you get applause, you get standing ovations. And then one day, without warning... they say, "Leave the mask at reception. Thank you very much. Off you go." And it's terrifying, Daniel. It's terrifying because nobody's gonna remember you. Until one day, you just drop down. Dead. Gone without a trace. But you know that as long as you keep delivering the goods, they'll keep you around, keep you alive because they still need you. So even though the general's intel was becoming useless, I made it look good, important, relevant. And they bought it. Things went wrong when... the general gave me this tip about the Syrian army going into high alert, and I spiced it up a bit, as always. Next thing you know, the military draft in 50,000 reservists and tanks on the Syrian border all for nothing. So, the brass started getting suspicious, started... triple-checking my reports. And then, whammo. My dear, old out-of-touch general brings me this lead on Angela. And just like The Boy Who Cried Wolf, now that I can bring them the real deal, they wanna kick me out. Kick me hard. I have nothing, Daniel. My father left Iraq some 60 old years ago. In Iraq, he was king. Went with the undergrounds, saved Jews in '41. Hold the British army during the war. So, in England, he thought he would continue to be king. But no, he was not. I saw how hard it was for him. How no place would have him. How he spent his days either sleeping or drinking. Missing Cafe Bouqs where he sat every day in Baghdad. Then he just died. And I swore, I'll be someone else. Someone who matters. Why did you sell out my father? No, no. I did no such thing. I was gonna take the rap. I wanted him to come out of this clean. But what did the moron go and do? Denies the whole thing. He wasn't going back to Israel. He wanted a child. He wanted a child before he died. He was obsessed with the idea. Then he met your mother. Immediately got her pregnant with you. Then they got married. I will do whatever is needed to help you, and to protect you. I appreciate that. But when this is all over, I will turn you in. I'm kosher. Yes, I know you are. By the way, Avram's not sick, is he? Not that I'm aware of. Why? He's been taking loads of Verelan. Something heart-related. He has a heart. Well, that's new. Judging by the way he's looking at that woman of his, I would say his heart is beating fast. That was quite wonderful, my dear. I want you out of here. Oh, that. Um, I can explain. Get out of my house. Out of my life. But I was gonna tell you... Out! Ta-ta. Hello? Dr. Angela Caroni? Who wants to know? Belgian State Security. Just follow us. This is the moment. We're in the money time. How old this place our guest determine from this moment on. I'd put all my chips on one number. Don't be surprised if you end up broke. I won't be surprised at anything. She's gonna take the bite. What if she doesn't? You know whom I miss the most right now? I miss your dad. I miss that son of a bitch. So how come we never saw you? You never came to any of the memorial days, nothing. Hardly ever heard about you before I signed up. Because I couldn't bear it. Couldn't you get that? I want nothing to do with you. Please, just listen. And if you don't accept my explanation, then you never have to hear from me again. Just go away. I don't want any drama. You have to listen. I lied... for absolutely no reason. Honestly. After Chernobyl... I decided I needed to take action. And that's how I ended up co-founding the green activists. We're kind of hardcore. Breaking the law pretty much everywhere. Got people after us, and I'm undercover. So, you're telling me that I work for a company that's actually your biggest enemy. Now I understand those other reasons. Look. The end... justifies the means. And if you have to put up a front, so be it. Yes, it can hurt, and sometimes, it does feel immoral, but... You have no other choice. So, you chose to fool me. No. I chose to fall in love. Take the flowers. That's where we're meeting tonight. Bitch. You see? I told you she would take the bait. Sorry, the driver took me somewhere else. My assistant, Daniel. Daniel, Angela, friend and fan of the cause. - Yes? - Yes. Tonight, we're taking action against the company responsible for the poisoning of hundreds, of thousands of fish. The result of a toxic waste they've been dumping into this river. Now, listen up. If anyone gets arrested, then the one and only name you're gonna be giving up is mine. For those who don't know me, I'm John Paul Mondong. Are we clear? - Yes. - Yes. Yes. So, what do you think? I think I might be able to help you guys. He's an impressive man. Yeah, inspiring. I'm worried about him. I'm worried about his heart. I'm taking good care of it. I really admire your dedication. I used to dream of going to Syria to help those poor refugees. I would adopt a Syrian kid without a second thought. They've really touched my heart. What? Nothing. All good. Come on, tell me. It's just... It's not child's play. It's very risky business. I know what I'm doing. If you're right about Viro, I'd be happy to help you. Really. Well, the file we're looking for is called the "Spider In The Web" I just hope you can find it. You just have to trust me a little. It will do you good. Want to join me? In a minute. I love you. I can't hear you. I said, I love you. No, you don't. Yes, I do. I really do. How are you, Dr. Caroni? I'm well, thank you. And you? Thank you. Have a nice day. You, too. Good morning. Listen. The "Spider In The Web" can be found only in the restricted area computers. It will be very complicated to break into them, but don't worry, I'll find a way. It's you I'm worried about. I don't want you getting hurt. You're my responsibility. I'm about to get my hands on the documents. We can't stop now. - "We"? - Yes, we. I'm pulling the plug. I know exactly what we have to do. Trust me. I'm pulling the plug. Have you totally lost your mind? She'll get caught. The system will latch onto the security breach in two seconds. Not with that flash drive we gave her. It's literally untraceable. I don't trust technology, you know that. Their security system's a tough one. We should find another way to do this. Avram, stop thinking with your dick and use your brain. If I don't have all the documents with me within the next 24 hours, I will personally make sure they put you on trial and lock your ass up in an egg cell. No one will know you ever existed. Am I clear? Twenty-four hours. Daniel. Hm? So, explain to me again. She doesn't have clearance to access the restricted area. The guy you're about to meet does. Easy. Easy. So what do I have to do... Wait. Now's your chance. That guy? He's a guard at Viro. He's on the late-night shift. Hey. - Cheers, my friend. - Cheers. So, it was really nice meeting you, man. See ya. I'm arriving now. I'm already inside. You don't have a lot of time before the morning shift arrives. - Be careful. - You, too. Thank you, doctor. I don't know what's happening. I'm... I was sick whole night, and I'm never sick. Well, we've all gotta be sick sometime. So that our mothers can... look after us. Give us a big hug. Give it 24 hours. You'll be as good as new. Ha, come on, son. Let's get you home. - Thirty minutes. - Okay. Take this guy out of here. Are you okay? It's nothing. Hey, stop! Hey. Oh, no. No. - I need to go in for a second. - You can't go in. No, you can't go in. - Can you stand? - Let's go. Drop us off at my car. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Now I'm starting to think she might be an extraction. You've gotta calm down. Everything is under control. I'm in. It's going to take 20 minutes to download. Shit. What is this? You sent over the wrong files. No, this is everything she got. There's got to be more. This is nothing. What do you mean it's nothing? This is the file we were after. Where is the smoking gun? This is all there is. Daniel. He's coming with us. You're done here. Thank you. As far as she is concerned, she carries the sun and the moon. Brave girl. Risking her life the way she did, and for what? I thought we can keep this civilized. I didn't want to shame you, Avram. But the entire investigation report came in. Out of a total of ten reports you signed off, you, in fact, saw the general only twice in the last two years. Twice! A warrant for your arrest has already been issued. I'm sorry, Samuel. He stays with me. I'm warning you. Stay out of this. I'm in charge until we finish this. You're both insane. Daniel, that's enough. Give him the gun. You go with them. No, that's not right. I'm one step behind you. If anything should happen to me, I want you to have this. It's the keys... to everything I have in the store in Brussels. You'll figure it out. Just don't tell anyone. No, no. You'll be fine. I don't need anything. A couple of years ago, I had a mild stroke. Got on the train, everything went dark. That's how I feel now, Daniel. I'm done. We should head to the airport and get on that flight. You're not going back with me. They'll bury you back home. You turn up without me, and they'll bury you. Especially after that stunt you pulled with Samuel. That wasn't very smart. Not very smart... but effective. We should go. I'll stay behind, fix a few things... then I'll give myself up. Don't worry about me. I'll just put the blame on you as always. I kept something for you. Go on. Wait here a second, okay? I appreciate you coming so quickly. Are we friends or what? We've left the club for you. - I need to talk to you. - Bad answer. I think she's in trouble and I'd appreciate it... Pleasure to meet you finally. Likewise. Tell me what the problem is. You have reached Dr. Angela Caroni. Please leave a message. Where are you? You're not answering your phone. Come as quickly as you can. We're in danger. I thought I locked the door. I have the keys. In fact, I own the place. I thought you were leaving. You know me. Need to get the job done. Yeah. That was always your biggest problem. Sublime. All we need now... is a glass of good Cognac. Sorry, I'm on duty. Meanwhile, I see you've been looking out for number one. Did what everyone else does. Want us to make sure we're sitting pretty before retirement. You know how it goes. If it hadn't been me, would've just been someone else. Hm. Your wife's ring. That was meant for Anne-Marie, the general's lover? That wasn't very fair. That was your biggest mistake. It wasn't the general. It was me. When Mussad started sniffing around Viro, when they was starting to get suspicious of Viro, I threatened the general that if he wouldn't give you the lead to Angela, I would kill Anne-Marie. And from that point on, it all just played out nicely. You, Grand Maestro Adereth, cleared Viro's name. Why did you have to hurt him? And her? That, I don't get. It was a threat. It was easy, really. I just leaked it to the Syrians, and they took care of the rest. She was just an afterthought. Cleaning up. So... how come they didn't go after me? Hmm. Love has really dulled your senses. I'm sorry. You should know that I really thought I... She was the best I had. I needed someone who could be your match, and she had motivation. Her real name was Amal Halinem. Her father was a Syrian businessman that your people killed years ago. I'm so sorry. Good that you found those photos. You surely realized what she was holding on to then? Obviously, planning to blackmail me later. I was always careful. You know me. Yes. I feel so sad, my friend. Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to land...
