Flament, you alright mate? Beer? 'Explosions In The Sky' is starting! Explosions here as well... Up to my neck in shit! Damn! Shit happens. Flament, Flament, Flament! Here we are now! Entertain us! We've made it! Can't remember anything. You? Nope. Checking yesterday's clips now... Want a Louis Vuitton? A handbag? Handbag? Really? Are you serious? Is this your first time here? That dude! Want a Louis Vuitton? Handbags are for fags. All my videos are gone... Creepy! Weird... What the fuck happened? I think I know! It's for on the beach. It's a windscreen. Maybe we can make a tent out of it. No. I'm not sleeping outdoors for 4 days. We'll work something out. - Work something out? Really? Wankers... Noise pollution... You got to pay attention. And what is this? I brought the wrong tent. I can see that. It's a windscreen. There's still room in my shroom. Yes. Great! - No. Why not? You can crash over there... That's a good idea, no? What else are we gonna do? Lucky bastard. Really. Super! Let's go. Wow! Check out this tent! It's a real mushroom! Polly wants a cracker? I'm not gonna eat that artisanal shit! But that's where my name comes from. From that missing girl? After a concert, some psycho tortured her. Guess how? With a hammer? No, not with a hammer. Idiot. A razor blade. A whip. A welding torch. Sick. Fuck. So? Polly... Three... two... one! Feeding frenzy! Fuck yeah, Mushroom Polly. Putain... Sweet little Kiwi... Kiwi, get up! Get up, Kiwi! Kiwi... Help! Help! Help... Polly... I'm gonna pay you in kind. - Oh really, mate? Whip. Heard you stole my bra. Razor blade. Naughty boy. Kiwi! Flament? Welding torch. Give him a golden shower... Did you tie me up, mate? Naughty. Kiwi... What do they say about me? Kiwi... My dear friend... Look at me now. Look at me. Look... Do you remember? Do you remember? Remember that poem? I forgot. Kiwi, I'm not really dying, you Know... I'm only on the toilet... Flament! Flament? Flament? Where are you? Kiwi... Kiwil Flament! Come on! Come on, Flament! Come on! Come on, Flament... Kiwi? Kiwi? Flament? Flament! Flament, it's Kiwi! Listen to me. Your friend's here. Can you hear me? Flament! Say something! Flament? Say something, goddamnit! Say something! Flament! Help! Flament! Flament, can you hear me? Help! I was so frightened, mate. Why did you do that? Normally it's me doing the crazy stuff... This is something that I do... We'll get through this...
