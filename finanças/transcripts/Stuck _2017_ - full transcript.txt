In the city's underground, there's a symphony of sound, a sonic chaos for the lost before they're found. There's a beauty in the sorrow, a kind of kinship that we borrow. For no matter how you hate it, I know I'll see you here tomorrow down on the subway. Just get off right here. No, I told you, I left it on the desk.

Your guess is as good as mine. He locked the door. Ladies and gentlemen! It must be apparent that I'm about to ask for money. But I will neither regale you with my tale of woe, nor will I claim to be a plagued veteran of the U.S. of A. I prefer, sirs, madams, to earn my wage. So I have prepared a performance, for your listening pleasure, from the work of Sir William Shakespeare. To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or by taking arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. To die... sleep, no more; and by a sleep to say we end... Excuse me. Could you not do that? Is it your intention to deprive these fine people of their entertainment? Soft you now? Twill do, fine sir. Ah, there's the rub. My man! We'll probably move in a minute or something. I'm an artist, actually. Sor... Uh, kinda like an artist/writer, I guess. Not professional or anything... yet. Um, I've been working on this comic that um... Uh, see? It's about a teenaged, handicapped superhero. She's risen above her misfortune to battle... Look, I don't feel like talking right now. Oh. You speak E... Yeah. Your, um... Your dancing is... is good. How do you know? Uh, what? You a dancer? No, um, I'm not. Then why are you hanging around the studio? Well, like I said, I'm an artist, actually, and I wanna... Right. Remember just a second ago, when I said I didn't wanna talk? - Yeah. - Yeah. I meant that. Okay. Yeah, um... I don't wanna talk at all, about anything. Okay? We could talk about nothing. Nothing's good. No thing. Which is fascinating if you think about it in the nihilistic sense, because... Seriously?! Do you think when I say, "I don't wanna talk," that I really do wanna talk to you? No. I... I just wan... I don't see you trying to show your stupid comic book to anyone else on this train. That's because I... I thought you would enjoy it, too. What? Did you think maybe I was some cute little Asian girl that was gonna cover my face and giggle at all your clever little quips? Oh!

Oh, no, he'll understand. He... Oh! You're speaking English. I should've... My Spanish is... You might be interested to know that, um, the Spanish that I do know, I learned from our janitorial staff... I mean our, um, maintenance men. You're just like them. I mean, you're not just like them, but you, um... Well, I can see you're a very diligent worker. Well, I... I just think you're very fortunate. It's clear for you why you work. I mean, you're lucky. You know who you are. Fortunate? This country wasn't made for people like me. It was made for people like you. Then why are you here? Seriously, why? Maybe because when it comes down to it, it's better than anywhere else in the world. Better if you're a rich white man. - I'm not a rich white man. - Maybe your papiis. What makes you say that? Your English is too good for a Chinese girl. I'm Korean. I don't have anything you can't get for yourself. You've never had to decide between seeing your family and feeding your family. You probably never even had to pay for your own toilet paper. Nobody forced you to have a bunch of kids. I think it's incredibly honorable that he puts the needs of his family before his own. Okay. I get that. But what if something bad happened to you? What if you got hurt? What would you do? Go to the hospital, right? And you'd be treated. Only, and correct me if I'm wrong, you don't have health insurance, so you wouldn't be able to pay. Well, that's a rather heartless way of... Right! I know. That's the conundrum, right? So what happens is a bunch of hospitals have to shut down because of the overwhelming demand of people who get sick and hurt and can't afford to pay their bills. You think people are just supposed to be left bleeding in the street? No. I didn't say that. So they're not supposed to go to no hospital? There are reasons we have the laws that we do. There are reasons there were slaves. Illegal immigrants are not slaves. They come here because they want to. And do the work nobody else wants to do. Okay, but if they don't pay taxes, then... Wait, wait. How do you know he don't pay taxes? Most of them don't. "Most of them?" See what I'm saying? Racist. I don't mean Hispanics. I mean illegal immigrants. "I don't mean to be racist, I mean to be racist." No, no, no. You're twisting my words. Girl, I got you. You've been tagged. - Okay, listen to... - Tag! - Most... - Tag! - Most imm... - Tag! - Most imm... - Tag! Can I finish my sentence, please? Yeah, you can finish your racist sentence. Go ahead. Okay, first of all, I'm not the one who's racist. We're not all Chinese! And most illegal immigrants don't pay taxes because they have to get paid under the table. That's a fact. Doesn't matter if they're Mexican, Bengali, Indian... Damn! Do you hear yourself? Which means they enjoy the benefits of our society without contributing, which hurts everyone! If he wants to live in America, then he... You wouldn't even be here if your mommy and daddy could make their own kids. Wow. You got a bad case of rude. Oh, yeah? You people got your shit 50 years ago and still don't have it together. Excuse me? "You people"? You had a black president and still kill each other like it's your job. Which is good, 'cause you usually don't have one. So I defend your sorry ass, and that's what you got to say? You only opened your mouth 'cause black people love to call racism any time they can. I call it when ignorant people put it in my face. Well, maybe if you weren't so ignorant as a people. Okay. I'm gonna need you to watch your tone, Speedy Gonzales. What the hell are you doin' all day? Standin' in the street, fumandomarijuana, blarin' shit from your stereo. mamita. Life ain't your ride and your weave.

How much did you give that guy, anyway? $20. Takes me three hours to make that. I can give you some, too, if... if you want... No, no, no, no, no. I work for my money, mijo.

You'd make a fantastic mother. How could you be so sure? Just some "white-woman bullshit." Maybe she'd actually be doing a service by saving some kid from a life of misery. I didn't mean that a kid would be miserable with you specifically. I-I just... I just meant it's hard, you know, for... for anyone to feel connected to anybody else. It's all pretty pathetic. I mean who in this city... actually, who... who in the world ever just tries...

Wow. Deep thoughts from Creepy Time Subway Stalker. You know, it's weird how you think that you can say anything you want to anyone you want. I don't think that. No? What about all that smack you were talking to him earlier? "Smack"? I wasn't talking smack. It was just a debate. Oh. Right. So it's totally okay for someone like you to have a debate, but you feel fine telling me when I need to shut up? - I didn't tell you to shut up. - Yeah, you did. Seriously, what... what is the deal? Is someone just handing out entitlement cards to girls like you that just give you the go-ahead to act like a... Bitch? I didn't say that, but, okay, yeah. Whatever. What's that like? What's whatlike? Being entitled to pick and choose the guys allowed to look at you or speak to you. I don't get to pick and choose that stuff, 'cause if I did, you wouldn't be talking to me right now. See?! That's what I'm talking about. Th-That's exactly what I'm saying.
