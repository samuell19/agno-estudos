American Come on, come on! We will take you to Arezzo. On what basis? There are plenty of reasons. Starting from this corpse... But we did not know anything about him! You explain this to Lieutenant Ferry. But who told you that we are here? An unknown called she saw the burning lights. We thought we would catch drug dealer, and here... I'm sorry, I didn’t want get you in trouble. If this is trouble, then you better Do not meet them alone. Would you like to hurry up? Police. Command post. Arezzo. How did you know that under magnolia were these remains buried? We did not know anything about this. Ahh! And what did you do there? Looking for mushrooms? Vasco is telling the truth. Neither he nor I could know what is stored under magnolia. But you unearthed there! This means that you were hoping to find something. You know, all these evasion answers... make me think that you are covering someone. Who sent you there? Good. I’ll just remind you what is the behavior exacerbates your position. He has nothing to do with it. I asked him to dig there. Susan, I don't want to... It’s best to tell the truth. And what is this truth? In one old diary hidden in the old box, in the castle of the Duke of Foskey... And where is this castle located? In the village of Aretino. Please let me say Signorina! In this diary it was written what's under this magnolia... hidden the secret of the Foski family. So I asked Vasco help me dig there. And who wrote this diary? I dont know. Guess girl but she does not give her name. Where is this diary now? They stole it from me... along with a passport. Does this mean that you have no documents? She has temporary documents issued American Consul in Florence. Who guarantees me their authenticity? Hello? Am I talking to Consul Berger? - Who is it? Who's calling me at three in the morning? This is Susan Anderson. - Susan Anderson...? Is it Susan Anderson? - Yes, let me give you the call... Excuse me, how is your... - Let me! Says Lieutenant Ivan Ferry from Arezzo police. We have a duplicate passport here Signorins Susan Anderson, which was detained today when excavating a corpse. Excavating a corpse... This is Susan Anderson - it's just a punishment! At first she falls asleep at the wheel... then they rob her... and now she already walks through the cemeteries! In fact, we didn’t detain her at the cemetery. Not in the cemetery? - Not! Say what can I do and i will do it. We need someone to come to us. confirm the authenticity of documents. I understood. I'll sort it out now. Well thank you! Thanks for your help! Waiting for you! Oh... Susan Anderson... Can we go now? Let's see... Your identity has been established, but I advise you to speak with a lawyer. I did nothing and I do not need a lawyer. But your lawyer has arrived five minutes ago. My lawyer? Lawyer, come in! - Good evening! - Good evening! Lieutenant, good evening! - Good evening! I want to talk in private with my client. Of course Bucca’s lawyer. It's your right. Please settle down! Be calm, I'll be back soon. Where are you from? - Louisville, Kentucky. - Gee! How did you know that I'm here? In the village they learned about what happened... The bar owner called me and I came. Should not have. - How was it not necessary? I live five minutes from here I'm a lawyer... and not come? I already told the investigator that did nothing. And so I don’t need any lawyer! This, please, let me decide! Vasco, I'm talking to you as a lawyer. You should listen to me. How are you connected with the find of these remains? This story is related to Susan. I do not think it will be right tell you about it. Of course, Susan... Listen, I understand that you are upset... - Upset...? I am angry like a dog! If I am not mistaken, did you and I have an affair? Novel? You tried to keep everything is a secret... And are you talking about a novel? You forget that I just split up in her husband? Already three years how do you not live with him! You just didn't want You were seen with someone like me! It is not true! In any case, I'm not here for that. Tell me what happened to Susan? We agreed to meet at 11 in the evening, to go to the bridge of Buriano. Where do lovers go ?! Did you make love - Forget about this story! Do you know what I will say? Very well, that you're in trouble because of her. May protect you public defender! Is that you? You can go now. But remember that you must come to answer the judge’s questions. I don't know anything about this corpse. - Yes, I believe you, I believe! But criminal will be required expertise, to at least establish the identity of who was buried 20 years ago. And now Lieutenant Ferry lets you go home. And Signorina Anderson? It's a little more complicated for her because we must still establish her identity. Go! Go! All the best! - Good night! Susan! Vasco, I thought you were gone. I didn’t want to leave you alone. What did they do to you? They are all very helpful. We are waiting for the Consul. And then they must inspect the castle. I have to show them the place where did i find the diary. Anyway, remember that i am with you. Thanks. You have no idea, how dear to me your help. Signorina Anderson? - Someone came... See you in the village. Okay bye! - Till! Here is the coffee, let's start with it. This day promises to be long. Good afternoon! I'm sorry, that I woke you up at night. But I did it only to release Signorina Anderson as soon as possible. Don’t worry, Lieutenant Ferry. I would have arrived earlier but I asked to send me... by email from Kentucky also birth certificate. The identity of an American citizen Susan Anderson has been thoroughly tested. And that means if you are at her have nothing else... it would be better to send her home as she planned. But I do not want to leave! - Yesterday you said something else. Signor Consul, anyway, Signorina must linger... until some circumstances of this case. I want to stay here as long until they reveal this secret regarding the story of my family. As you wish, Signorina Anderson. Let me know when you fly to the States. So I will be sure that I can finally relax. Good luck My respect, lieutenant! - Thanks. Bye! Look, the police! - What happened? Someone robbed? Check this out! We haven’t seen the police here. Why did they come? That night at the Buriano Bridge something terrible happened. Look, American... American...! Here to the left. Susan? - Vasco...? Remember that I am with you! - Thanks! If not you... Who's there? - Police. Good afternoon! “Signora, we have to look around the house.” I better go now. - Go! You are welcome! What is interesting here? - Nothing. I wonder if Nilda knows that her handsome smith... revolves around this American...? Since when are you so worried about her? Since I noticed that between her and Vasco is more than she says. The subscriber is temporarily unavailable. Signorina Anderson claims that the idea of digging under magnolia came to her... after reading the diary, hidden in the secret room of this castle. There are no secret rooms. Empty, abandoned rooms - yes. - There is one secret room! I got there on a spiral staircase. - What are you saying? I saw through the keyhole how she approached from the other side... and so I escaped through the window! - Well, what are you saying! Above the spiral staircase there is only a small closet. Okay, so let's look at this closet. - Of course. You are welcome! Watch it! There he is! In this closet I found a diary which talked about magnolia. Could you open it? - Of course. And inside this box except the diary, there was still a fragment of a photograph of some girl. Maybe you think that thieves put everything back in place? May be... Howbeit, there is no diary here. And no piece of photography. “But he was there!” I got here through this door. Behind this wall is a spiral staircase, which the servant had once used. She’s stuck because she’s already About ten years no one uses. But I entered here without difficulty. Baffled, impressed by what happened tonight. She confuses sleep with reality. I didn’t inspire myself and I’m not confusing anything! A diary is not a fantasy I took it and did wrong. But then they stole it from me. He had a cover with patterns. Light with blue lilies. If you do not believe me, ask Vasco, he also saw him. Here they are, those notebooks that Susan is talking about. I wrote down the expenses of household chores in them. My little one, there are no diaries. If you saw some kind of notebook it was a notebook with expenses. Listen to your scourge who loves you as a mother. Come on! Signora, we can inspect Signorina's room, as well as your room? Well, of course. Nilda, I have to talk to you. This applies to both of us. Vasco. Do you want to see how the police will find any paper, and we will be left without a village? I don’t even want to think about it! Maybe Vasco can tell us something? It seems to me that our Vasco now thinking about something else. Burgetti, enough! Lieutenant Ferry, nothing! Signorina Anderson, you must stay at our disposal and you can’t leave Arezzo, until the investigation is completed. Come on! Bye! - Bye! You are welcome! - Thanks! Here they are, here they are! The American remained inside. They must have searched. This is not for the protocol, I'll just ask you a couple of questions. You actually held that diary in your hands What is Signorina Anderson talking about? Of course yes! Maybe you read it? - No, I just saw a notebook with blue lilies. As we expected. Ok, thanks for the help. Sergeant, I'm starting to believe that this diary did not exist. Hey, home! Who did they find there by the bridge? Who was this buried? Sergeant maybe will you tell us something? You are not telling us anything... “You have nothing to know about!” This is the secret of the investigation. This is a diary and this is a picture of my daughter. Hide in a safe place! - Yes, be calm. I'll put them in my bank box where the mural documents already lie. I should have given them to you earlier. We took a big risk. Maybe it would be better to destroy everything? Well no, these things are too dear to me. Oh Susan, we were here with lawyer Berruccini. Too bad he arrived so late. The police just left. Biche just told me about the search. This lieutenant Ferry wanted to confuse these fiction diary! This is not fiction! If they hadn’t stolen it from me, I could provide it as evidence. I understand... but if there is no diary, it is useless to insist. And you... You would say that you mixed up, and the police would let you go home as you planned. Tell the truth don't you believe me either? Of course I believe you! Let me do business and everything will be alright. You do not believe me. I do not need a lawyer who considers me either a liar or a madman. Lawyer, I refuse your help I will find another lawyer to whom I can entrust all questions concerning the castle and the ownership of the village. Susan, think carefully! That is why I do this. If you are really so sure... - Very sure! Well, then I have nothing more to add. I can only prepare the documents... for referral to a lawyer, which will take my place. But your grandfather wouldn’t like it. - Leave my grandfather alone! He cannot serve as an example to me after all that he had done. As you wish, Signorina. And now, lawyer, Biche takes you to the door. You undoubtedly have a lot to do in Arezzo. Come on, lawyer! Let's not waste time. I doubt that I will succeed to convince her. I never thought that she is so stubborn. Anyway, I go to the bank, and there it will be seen. Biche, now that it's all over... can i finally come in? What do you need? “I need to talk to Susan.” Stay away from these walls! They bring misfortune and sow discord. Or you let me in in a good way or I'll go in bad. Vasco, for God's sake... I'll go with you! “No, you better stay at home!” I won’t let anyone close me at home! Let's go to! It would be better if local will no longer see us together. End up with that they will all be against you. It does not matter! And then, everyone knows that we were together at the Buriano bridge. Moreover, we will not aggravate the situation. Do you know what we will do? Go around the castle and get quietly into my car. It is parked on the other side. And I'll be there in five minutes. Where are we going? - I need horseshoe horse near Arezzo. Nobody will see us there. Good. - Till. - See you later! O Lord do this so that they are not together! Otherwise, I can never find peace. For a long time? - You can get out! Thank you for coming with me. I also wanted to see you. Are you sure that where we go there is no one from the village? What bothers you so much? I don't want because of me you had problems. Your bride... “She's not my bride!” I understood perfectly what are you together. Therefore, she should not see you with me. To be honest, you and I too should not see each other again. Susan, after this night, Nilda and I no longer talking. And I think more we will never talk. It was a gamble. - What does it mean? I met her two years ago in Arezzo. She has a riding horse and I shoe her. She liked me and I liked her. But love is another. Come on! Let him gallop on the occasion. How exactly he rides! And when will you mine? - Never! He's good for nothing. “Now I'll show you.” Let's go! You must think as well about the inhabitants of the village. They take too much that I am on their side. It is right. It's a pity, that no one is on my side. You are alone and you are tired. Overnight at the police station search, diary gone... You have to calm down. - But how? Whose remains are these? And who wrote the missing diary? Daughter Biche or someone else? And not to mention the pain which I experienced upon learning that... my grandfather was a terrible person able to take advantage of a young girl. Praise God that I did not know him. Otherwise, I would worry even more. Sorry. Hello, Billy? Susan, where did you go? You should have informed me when you arrive, but didn’t call. I'm still in Italy. Here something serious happened. What? Are you not feeling well? No, physically everything is fine with me. But strange things happen. I found an old diary in the castle... - A diary... But there is something in it What will help us sue the village? No, this is not connected with the village. It speaks of a secret hidden under magnolia. But when we went looking... Billy? End the conversation! - Signorina, we will talk at a meeting. When you come back? “I get it, you can't talk.” Bye, Billy. - Thank you bye! Come to my office! “I'm coming, lawyer.” I have to pretend that I didn’t hear anything, but... The man who called you from America is this your fiance? I do not know. From the moment I arrived to Italy, I don’t understand anything anymore... neither about me nor about others. Listen, I’ll finish the horse shoe. and take you to one place where you can forget about your problems. Good. "Garden of lovers" And what is the name of this dish? It is called "Arrostichano." - Very tasty! I didn’t suspect but I was hungry. I noticed. Did you try almost everything that was on the menu. Can i pick up - Thanks! And to complete the meal, we have very good desserts. A slice of cake with pine nuts, macaroons or catalan cream? Tuscan cookies I've already eaten enough. Maybe better skip the dessert and let's go for a walk? She prefers to take a walk. - Good, have a nice walk! - Thanks! The police do not believe in the diary story. And they suspect that I'm hiding something. They want to find out everything, even if it’s possible crime has expired. And when they give you permission to leave, Who will take up the dispute about owning the village? What about the hotel project? - Who else thinks about the hotel? I thought it would be great bring some "America" to Tuscany. But I realized that this was a mistake. People come to us from all over the world to see to the beauty that surrounds us. And we want to save her. Now, let's enjoy this beautiful evening. You're right. Forget about the hotel locals, americans... And about everything else in the world. This evening there are only the two of us. Everything seems so incredible to me. But it is a reality. Such a magical reality! You think you need a lot of money to restore the castle? If you do everything yourself, then you can reduce costs. You ask because thinking about staying here? I have to get Master's Degree in Louisville. Master of Italian Literature Middle Ages: Dante, Bocaccio, Petrarch... They all lived here in Tuscany. So, are you considering staying here? Moreover, you must stay here! Do not say things that you will regret. “I will not be sorry, I am sure of that.” We must protect love who was born between us. From everything and from everyone. I don’t dream of more. But first you have to... part with your... like him there... an American guy. You know very well that his name is Billy. We met when I was in my first year at university. The problems are not in Louisville, they are in this castle. Are you still thinking about the diary? I came here to find out about my origin. And what did I find out? Only terrible things. Is it true or not I won’t calm down until I find out. Have you spoken to biche? I did not have the courage ask her about her daughter. And about my grandfather she said that he had a "black" soul. Susan, if I could help you... - You can. - How? You talked about an old blacksmith who was familiar with his daughter Bice. I even remember his name Bartolo. Yes, but be that as it may, he is a very complex person. And then... so much time has passed I think he doesn’t remember anything. Please, Vasco, let's try! Can I ask you something? - All you want. Why did I have to persuade you for so long so you take me to this Bartolo? Bartolo and his late wife took me from the shelter when I was 10 years old. All the families I've been to before abandoned me. You are an orphan. I lost my mother too when she was little. And my father got married so quickly. I'm lucky my grandmother loved me very much. And I didn’t have anyone. Maybe somewhere there is my father or mother. Howbeit, I grew up very far from here. In one mountain shelter called "Region of Southern Italy". There I spent my rebellious childhood. It's not easy being born with the stigma of the refusenik. But Bartolo and his wife They loved you very much. They are yes. Mom louise died when I was 17 years old. She really wanted so that I learn to be an accountant. By the way, I even got a diploma. But Bartolo realized that my horses were real passion. And therefore, he trained me his ancient profession as a blacksmith. And left me his workshop. He was good. Even if he has difficult character. Even worse than mine. And I really like your character. But you told me that I was unbearable...? “Well, I didn’t know you yet.” Now I know that you are faithful, honest and you know exactly what you want. What I don't brag about is that that it’s very difficult for me to forget the insult. Thank God we arrived otherwise I could continue for a long time. He knows I'm nobody I don’t want to see here. Bartolo? Bartolo? This is Vasco. I'm sorry, but he is not. - It's strange. The coals in the fireplace are still hot. Let's go to, let's look on the street! Bartolo! Bartolo! Come on! Hi father! What about the girl? Where is she? Don’t say she’s not here because I smell her. I'm here. But I didn’t suspect I smell so much. The smell of youth and flowers. What has not been seen here for a long time. Her name is Susan Anderson, she is American. She is the granddaughter of the Duke of Foskey. You can find out why did you bring her here? In one of the rooms of the castle, Susan found a diary written by some girl. It speaks of the duke. So what? - Vasco said that you knew daughter Bice well. And I'm sure this is her diary. The girl speaks of a secret hidden under magnolia in a park near the Buriano bridge. And under magnolia we found... - You can not continue. Hidden under magnolia the remains of the girl. Fragile creature she did not have time to take a sigh. Who is the father of this girl? Fifty years ago at Beach daughter Angelica was born. She was so beautiful. Biele insisted so that my daughter doesn’t walk a lot. She had no idea what to use... beauty and innocence 15 year old daughter maybe the duke. Angelica wrote about her bad luck in love. Her photograph was torn in half, as if she didn’t want to show who was next to her. And you don’t have enough what did you find out And you know nothing more about this story? Nothing. Nobody came to the castle. Sometimes antiques experts came, to estimate the cost of furniture, which the duke was selling. Sometimes restorers came. The castle was full of valuables but the duke squandered everything. Buriali, try to work, rather than molest a girl. Just a few words. - Work, work! This was not his worst sin. When Biche noticed that Angelica is pregnant she decided to declare to the duke for child molestation. And he, to avoid scandal and prison, made her a promise. I promise you lifelong maintenance for your daughter provided that you take her away from here so that no one suspects anything. Want to buy my daughter's honor and my maternal dignity. Do you want to send me to the judge? Come on! In court, it turns out that your daughter I was provoked every day. It is not true! “It turns out that your daughter is a whore!” It is not true! - My word is against yours... Who will the judge believe? They will talk about your daughter in all okay, does that suit you? Think about it well! Hope I help Angelica... But God knows how I would like see you in jail. Angelica gave birth prematurely gave birth to twins. Baby I myself buried under magnolia... You? - At that time, my household belonged to Foski. Sorry, but why didn't you tell me anything? “And the other twin?” It was a boy. Biche asked me accompany Angelica... to a small shelter in southern Italy. Her late husband was from those places. Small indoor guesthouse at the abbey of San Dorotheo? It is he. Angelica by the time already completely desperate. After some time she committed suicide. And the baby was left an orphan. You say biche didn’t leave a grandson? Instead of loving her grandson, she kept in her heart daughter's mourning and hatred of the duke. She also thought about the poor creature, born under an unlucky star. For him, the family could become guarantee of peace. But the child was rebellious. Therefore, all the families who took him under guardianship, brought him back to the shelter. So I did everything to take you to me. A way to atone for what i did not. For not declaring to the duke. And the one who is silent is an accomplice. And since then I don’t know how to tell you that you are the son of the Duke of Fosca. And the grandson of Bice. Oh my God! If he could forgive me then I could also forgive myself. I fell into hell. I came here in search of paradise... We should never see each other again! If someone told me that the duke is my father I would beat him to death and then fed to pigs! See why we can’t see each other anymore? The duke is also my grandfather. Vasco, one blood flows in our veins! But we did not know! Our love is innocent! - No more! We must forget, and better yet. cross out from life what happened. It's as if it's that simple! All these years, I see Bice every day, and Today I find out that she is my grandmother. Then, I fall in love with you and it turns out that we are blood relatives. Do not say! Enough now! This will never happen again! This should not happen anymore! Why? Listen, it will be better if you come out here. For you and for me too. You're right. As you can see, at this table we collect signatures of all residents of the village. They voluntarily united in order to resist... ridiculous demands Signorins Susan Anderson. First hearing scheduled next week. We will show her! Our village and do not touch it! Our village and do not touch it! Our village and do not touch it! One minute I want to introduce you with our representative. Here is a journalist from Arezzo television. She wants to talk to you. Come, or you are more not interested in the village? Of course I’ll go. And then I must stay to collect signatures. I know where to be and with whom to be. You wanted to talk about it, when did you write a message? What message? - Last thing. In which you spoke that we should talk about you and me. Yes, of course... about that... yes. Do not let foreigners come here! The village belongs to the inhabitants! Vasco, forget about what happened! I also want to forget. So even better. Susan! Susan! - What? What do you want? Listen, I don’t know if I am doing the right thing... But I wanted to tell you that I have a letter written by the duke to my father. It could come up and interrupt the period of acquisitive prescription in the village. I say this because we could agree with you. I want to get out of this war. Do not worry! I hear more I don’t want about this village! Never! Billy! - Surprise! What are you doing here? Oh my God! I'm so glad! - I, too! I'm so glad to see you! “I could no longer be without you!” I can not believe it! Come in! - Good. Billy! - This technique is worth it to spend 20 hours on the road. When did you arrive, and how? You seemed to me on the phone so sad and confused that I flew on the first flight. And here I am! You should have arrived earlier much earlier. It was necessary to say. But when am I to you called you were always out of sorts... I was wrong, Billy! If only you knew how wrong I was! I shouldn't have let you go alone. But now it's over. I'm here. - Yes. Even if I don’t know him, I let him in anyway. I thought you would be glad meet him here. If you need anything: relax or wash, everything has already been cooked upstairs. Now Billy and I will go chat over a glass of wine with a slice of cheese. And it will be visible there. “I'll set the table right there.” No no. Don’t worry, Biche! I myself. As you say. If you need anything, I'm upstairs. Good. Let's go! What a delicious wine! “It's from my grandfather’s winery.” Why don't we make it and not send to America? From the moment I'm here so much bad happened. Why don't you explain this story to me with magnolia, I didn’t understand anything on the phone. Forget it. Billy, now it’s important so you take me away from here. Even if negotiations with residents The villages are not finished yet. It’s more likely not negotiations, but... like this... what’s called when they swear...? This is a contest of property. And this discourages negotiations with hotel investors. Forget the hotel, Billy! I want to go home to Louisville. Well then, call the lawyer of Beruchchini, let him prepare the papers. He has already prepared the papers. But how are you Can you do this in Louisville? My boss has connections with one major law firm in Rome. We will send all the documents to them. It will be the easiest way. We can go back to America and there, we can even get married. To get married? - Why not? I love you... you love me... and then... I got a small share of the profit in our law office. Look, I'm an enviable groom! Think about the wedding when we get home. For now, take me away from here. It is not so easy, my passport stayed with the police. But you are an American citizen they cannot do that if you didn’t do anything unlawful. This is exactly what claims American consul. But that day I was stupid and said with him that I want to stay. Now you want return with me to America. Just call the Consul and say you want to leave. Right. But it will be better if you call him. Of course, but now we will go to the hotel. To the hotel? - Yes, I don’t want to stay here. Not even here hot tub. Hotel "Vasari" in the center of Arezzo. Enough for you to take me out of the village. Let's go to! I didn’t ask... How was the travel? Not bad... I just wanted to sleep and the stewardess constantly woke me. Maybe because it was supposed to to serve me, whether she liked me. Billy, stop talking nonsense! Not now! Come on, Susan... I'm here with you. Stop being sad! And you agreed to sleep here? This room is like the witch’s room from Snow White. By the way, I didn’t sleep a wink. Who is this? - One ancestor. He is terrible. He has such a look as if he was peeping. Billy, you're starting to bother me. Go down! - But... You don't want did i help you with your luggage? Billy, I'll call you. Go down! Why are you packing up? Billy prefers to stop at the hotel. I will go with him. I'm so glad to see you together with this nice guy. I didn’t hear you come at night and I was worried. Biche, we have what to say to each other. About my grandfather, about the diary, as well as about your daughter... No, I can’t talk about her. This wound has not yet healed. And what about your grandfather, what did you learn about him? What is enough to want to run away from here. Just think, I was in such delight, having come here... I had dreams and hopes... I wanted to know about my roots and take root here... Instead... You will not believe, but i love you so much. You are a beautiful and good girl. Okay. Billy is waiting for me. Better not go back to sad events... Neither you nor me. Enough to get me back my passport and let me leave. I told you from day one that you don’t need to stay here. I had a right to know! But let's not talk about that anymore. Billy, I'm ready! Take the bags! I'm coming! Here I am! - Take this one! And it's all! - Yes. All the same with whom I came. Take a backpack too! Let's move! - One minute. Susan, at work I'm like a mastiff, who does not let go of the victim. You will see that we are in one day solve the problem. Are you satisfied I am glad that you are here. You Susan know me as a man but you don’t know how to be a lawyer. Enough about that! Let's go to! Open up! Why is this woman so looks at me? She is a lawyer for the villagers. Ah, a colleague. Maybe go talk to her? No, Billy! Come on! I will give her my business card. “Billy, I said no!” Wait Susan! - Come on! Come on! Susan, why are you in such a hurry? Should it be an American bridegroom? Take this suitcase! - Yes. - Thanks. Move! - I'm coming! He arrived at the right time. What are you talking about? “Forget it, forget it.” Vasco, what's going on? Everything was so wonderful until she showed up. Nilda, this is a very complicated story. But in my opinion everything is very simple. I think of you, and you think about her. Do not do like this. We are each other made no promises! I would like now so you promise me a lot. Nilda, forgive me. “Vasco, let me go, please!” Just one minute, Nilda. It will pass. Forget. I am a lawyer, I understand when the business is lost. This yours. Hello? Yes, this is Billy Jackson. I called an hour ago. I wanted to talk to the Consul, if possible. I was told to call back. Yes. - On the line is lawyer Billy Jackson. Says it is urgent. Connect with him! Hello, Signor Consul. First of all thanks that you agreed to talk to me outside working hours. I am calling on a question regarding my bride, Signorina Susan Anderson. Oh, Susan Anderson, Louisville, Kentucky. - Exactly. I am very pleased that you remember her. How can you not remember her ?! What happened this time? Nothing. Signorina wants return with me to the USA but the Italian police her I haven’t returned my passport yet. Omit that the investigation of the case, to which she is involved is not yet finished. Signorina Anderson wants to leave today, but yesterday I wanted to stay. Yes, because yesterday she I didn’t know that I would come. So Signor Consul, what can i say susan Please tell me Signorina, that I died for her! Let it get out and never calls me again! Signor Consul? Hello? Have you talked to the Consul? - Yes. He is an old tantrum you can’t rely on him! Tomorrow morning I will go to the police and try to fix it myself. What a pity! I was hoping to leave tomorrow. Even if we stay a couple of days, I know a great way to spend time. We haven’t made love for so long... A long time ago. We have to catch up... “But... aren't you tired?” Road, change of time zones... “I'll sleep well later.” I'll take a shower and get back to you. - Well. We are in local Arezzo Police Department to listen to the important statement of lieutenant Ivana Ferry. Recall the body of a newborn girl was discovered at the Buriano bridge... American Susan Anderson and a blacksmith from the village of Aretino Vasco Benchi. Yes. Examination confirmed that the body belonged to a girl who was born dead at least about thirty years ago. And the results of the examination exclude any criminal motive. Moreover, since the statute of limitations body burial has expired, we can declare this case closed. Of course still remain incomprehensible motives... like burial places and body detection... Billy, wake up! - What happened? Have you washed already? The case of magnolia is closed! Means we can go! My passport will be returned! Excellent. But why shouldn't we lie a little longer? After all, nobody chases after us ?! Are we lounging and finally making love? Susan, but where are you going? Another night in the yard! Billy, it's seven in the morning! We need to go to the police first. Then you go to Beruchchini’s lawyer, I'm at the travel agency. But if we are in Italy, why not we do not stay for a couple of days in Rome or visit Venice. Finally, me to work only on monday. Between me and Italy should lie across the ocean. Scourge! Bartolo told me that I am your grandson. He promised me not to tell you anything. Why should he be silent? Let's go to the house! Biche, I have the right to know the truth. And I want to know her now. Well? - You won’t believe me, but I refused about you just for your good. What do you think was so simple leave you in a shelter? I did this only because I was sure what will you be calmer far from mourning and arbitrariness. Let's say it's true, but This is an explanation for the child. But now I'm already a man. How could you see me near In workshop... and not even feel the desire tell me you are my grandmother? When Bartolo told me he was leaving this workshop for you, I was hit by a blow. He did it on purpose! - No need to change the subject! We are talking about you not about Bartolo! I wanted to wait until the duke died and then tell you everything. I would hug you and I would apologize. Do not lie to me! Old Man Foski is dead and you continued to be silent. No, don't be so bad to think about me. My fault is great, but I'm trying to find a way pay for what I did. Give me time, Vasco! Give me some time! You will understand! - What is there to understand? If Susan hadn’t come, most likely you wouldn’t tell me anything. Not. I swear, it is not so! Vasco! This is not true! Biche, let’s leave it! It will be better to forget about it! I should have been right from the start forget about everything. Now it's late! Too late! Beruchchini's office is here. You rise and in the meantime I’ll go confirm the flight. Good. The impression that your land is burning under your feet. Since they returned my passport, no more reason to wait. As you want. But on a honeymoon we'll go to Venice, okay? I promise. I'll be waiting for you on Rosario Square in an hour. Under the arches. How will I find her? - It is impossible to make a mistake. It's around the corner. Big square. I advise you not to be late. Beruchccini's attorney is very punctual. Good. Susan! What are vaults? “Arches, Billy.” - Ahh... good. Take it easy! - Thanks! Lawyer, you can’t imagine how glad I am to meet you personally. I see you are a very young lawyer. Congratulations, damn it! Listen to what you bring? Mineral water, juice, coffee...? - Mineral water, please. You americans watch your health! Please come in and settle down! Arisa? - Yes? So, mineral water for a lawyer Jackson and coffee for me. This very minute, lawyer. Well... dear colleague, you yourself Can't imagine how glad I am that the granddaughter of the duke of foski will be in such good hands. You know, I would be very sorry transfer documents to someone else. But I think that with you Signorina Anderson will be protected at the highest level. I am sure about that. - Thank you, lawyer, you are very kind. So here. These are cadastral maps, these are acts of origin, related documents here with the village and its inhabitants, and this is a notice of the lawsuit of Nilda Bucca. Of course, your Italian laws, and really very complex. We are right in the homeland my dear colleague. But sometimes these old laws become an excessive burden. This is the blackthorn... a maze from which there is no way out. Therefore I advised your bride to sell the castle. So far, lack of content and desolation it was not completely destroyed. In this case, nothing prevents to continue dispute over the ownership of the village. Be that as it may, from that moment as I saw the situation in the castle I completely agree with you. Only, in my opinion, will be not so easy to find a buyer. And here you are mistaken, dear colleague. You want to say that you already have is there a buyer in mind? I like to deal with such smart interlocutor like you, understanding everything at a glance. Let me one moment. Arisa? Yes. Find me Signora Buchirossi. We have a buyer. And very good. Hello! - Excuse me, do you have a free table? There’s that free one, settle down. - Thanks. Yes Yes. Jackson Lawyer at your disposal. Yes. He is here in my office, sitting opposite. Signor Buchirosi, if this suits you, we can sign the contract today. Good. Let's say at 15.00. Here in my office. Good. Thank you! See you! Thanks! Well, it's done! Well then, lawyer, I will take the documents. No no. So take it away Notice of Attorney Bucca's lawsuit, and I need the rest for agreement. - Of course of course. I was really pleased to meet such a competent lawyer like you. In fact. I’ll warn you my bride and see you here at three. Come, I will accompany you. - Thanks. You are welcome. Ariza, call back Signora Buchirossi. Ask to arrive early, at 13.00. Yes. We need to talk with him. At 13.00... Yes, at one in the afternoon. Good. What a rush sign it today? Susan, from the moment I arrived you tell me you want to sell the castle. I want to get out of here. If due to meeting with Beruchchini we will be late for the plane... This is a couple of signatures. Everything is already prepared. Beruchchini takes only one percent. Can you imagine how much it costs do it through an agency? Susan, you want to sell, Yes or no? I do not want any more return to Italy. Okay. So it will be better if we sell this castle before it collapses. We can deal with this today and you, instead of rejoicing... You're right. I am extremely happy! This is just a castle... I get it. The fact is that you are excited. But you know what we will do to celebrate...? Of course I know! Putting things together. - Things... yes... This is not what I was thinking... Will you pay? - Yes. Look, Bartolo. For a hundred years he was not visible in the village! I was still in elementary school, and he was already walking with a gun. He is a blacksmith, but his real passion has always been hunting. Why does he walk with a gun Does he have permission? He doesn’t part with him, when the hunting season begins. Hi Bartolo. Vasco? Vasco! This is Bartolo. This one always walks with a gun. Better call your boy here. Giannino! Giannino where are you? Giannino? I'm here. What happened? - Quickly come here and sit next to me! He left unexpectedly and now unexpectedly returns. Calmly. If he hears you, it can bend in half. Hi Bartolo! - Hi. I'll bring you something have a drink, Bartolo? Bring something. I'm looking for Vasco but the workshop is closed. I have not seen him today. Do you know where Biche is? I saw Biche when she left. Wait, sooner or later she will return. Bring me a glass of Fanta. When Vasco came to say that he knows everything, I felt, that the earth is getting out from under my feet. Is that all? That I am his grandmother. That his mother was called Angelica, and that duke... No need to tell me family history. You didn’t tell him about the mural? - Not. I needed to tell him that I deceived the duke. But you are a witness... I did it, just to make money... and give them to him, poor guy, who had such a terrible childhood. But now, knowing the truth that he is a son Duke, he will begin the struggle for his rights. And how the son of the duke owes him half of all that is available. You think it's easy to prove something with such and such relatives. You see, you can do a DNA test, but it takes years of litigation. Hearings, documents, evidence, this does not include legal costs. My dear biche, you say so because you don’t know that I managed to convince the groom Americans sell the castle. Contract signing take place today. Today? - At three o'clock everyone will gather to sign the contract. and as soon as the deed is done remove the wall from drywall... and Signor Buchirosi gives us one million euros each. And what will he do with the mural? What will do? Will show her at exhibitions. He is one of the new rich, a wine producer. He even made a request to the Institute of Heraldry, when I was sure that he found the original portrait of the baron. Be that as it may, I no longer want neither be silent nor wait. You waited thirty years because of the acts of the duke, and now you want to drop everything what was done? Biche, come on! Stop talking! I'm worried too and about the happiness of your Vasco. Instead of doing it right you want to ruin everything. From this story my head is spinning. There is no reason. Are you in good hands, hey? Come on! Now go! Because at one o'clock in the afternoon will come Buchirossi discuss the terms of the contract, and at three I have Americans. Come on! Go ahead Go ahead Be calm! Everything is going perfectly. Please Signor, come on in! A lawyer is waiting for you. I need to refresh my face. Where is the toilet? There at the end of the corridor There is a toilet for visitors. I'll go down to the bar to eat a sandwich. You feel at home here, right? Yes. As you wish. Lawyer, I want everything to be legal or I refuse. That's why I invited you to a few words in lunch break while no one is here. So I'm buying a castle. I give you two million euros for assistance in... and for hiding the mural. But I... it should be clear to you... I won’t give you another euro. Yes, and as for the housekeeper, then we will agree with her. But I do not think that this woman happy little. She realized that this mural attributed to the brush of Leonardo. We say we messed up that we were wrong. And then, you can file a lawsuit, if you want. If you do this, then she will go to jail. She hid the mural behind the wall. from drywall after the death of the duke. I will solve this issue. 50 - 100 thousand euros, and I will get rid of it. You convinced me. But I insist that everything should be clean. Draw up a clear and concise contract she will read it and will not go anywhere. And you can sleep peacefully. “I trust you, lawyer.” Listen i tried Brunello... - Mine? Yes. Excellent wine! Write to my account. “I'm treating you, Bartolo.” - Thanks! Why are you here? I need to talk to you. - Speak! Not here. Let's go to the workshop. So what made you come down from the mountains, father? The desire to make you think. About what? “About your interests.” You are the son of the Duke of Fosca. Your castle! The duke also had a daughter, and now there is a granddaughter. So you share the property, according to the law. Me from this castle do not need anything. It seems to me that this is wrong. - You say: wrong? And then what is right? It is true that the duke took advantage a young girl? That's right that he forced her get away from here... to hide your sins. It is right? Answer me! There is nothing right in this story. I will not participate in this. Now you say that. But are you sure why don’t you regret it? Roger, I know that I’m always calling at the wrong time. I wanted to tell you what I accepted proposal of lawyer Beruchchini. Later we will sign a contract, and then let's go straight to Fiumincino airport, okay? Good. Let me know in what time will you be in Louisville, huh? I will come for you at the airport. - Okay bye. Susan how many in Italy such ruins like this? It's not a wreck, it's one from the masterpieces of medieval architecture. This is the church of St. Eugenia in Bagnoro. How can you not understand what is this wonderful place? That could be Fosca’s castle if... - He is the same pimped... Okay... Ok listen! If you like it that way antiques, then we can furnish our home in the style of Old America. Are you satisfied “Stop asking if I'm happy!” The more you ask the more I feel like crying. Good. We better go now. I do not want to be late to Beruchchini. Take your suitcases! Vasco! Vasco, stop! Stop I need to talk to you! If you want to talk about the same thing, then he already told me everything. You can not strain. Even if it concerns his rights, he does not need anything from the duke's inheritance. Do not insist! He is more stubborn than me! Do what you want. Do you know that lawyer Beruchchini trying to steal Susan? So what? She thinks of herself I'll think about me! You can’t even imagine what is stored in the castle! Only pain and evil, that’s what! This is your grandmother listen to her! This castle holds one fresco. The fact that it is old was known. But five years ago, a professor came to evaluate the remaining paintings, which the duke wanted to sell. He looked at the mural and said that perhaps it belongs to the brush of Leonardo. And why no one knew anything about this mural? I hid her... Behind a drywall wall. Why? I obeyed lawyer Beruchchini. This snake did not want after the death of the duke this masterpiece fell into the hands of the granddaughter. And he promised that after the sale of the castle, I get a lot of money. I agreed. I wanted to give everything to you. And today I realized that he is deceiving me. And it won’t give me anything. He won’t give you anything because Susan didn't sell him. That's why. Wrong... Susan today signs a contract. You have to intervene! If you don’t do it, I will do it! I was silent for thirty years. And from that day I couldn’t calmly fall asleep. It will be better for everyone if Susan returns to America. Do as you know! But you're right, father! What they are trying to do with Susan, this is wrong! So you go to Beruchchini and arrange for him...! Yeah but susan to me would never believe. Someone is needed to convince her who can explain to her what a treasure hidden in the castle. This professor about whom did you say where is he? I don’t know, he is English. And the documents in the safe at Beruchchini. So she must take a word? Maybe... Do you remember? That guy from the Art Institute... from Castiglion Fiorentino...! - Not really. More than thirty years have passed. That young man said that the fresco has great value. And I wanted to restore it. But the duke suddenly drove him out. And you suddenly try to find him and bring to Arezzo to Beruchchini. See you there. But... that young man... do you even remember his name? Let's go... let's go... This guy wrote a letter to the duke. I saved it. Here it is... Sender... Here is the address of Castiglion Fiorentino. Go! - Yes. Answer Susan! Who is it? - No one. Listen, can you do it yourself? I don’t feel like... all these papers, lawyers... Maybe I'll go for a walk...? I can’t, I have to have power of attorney from you. I will write her. Tell me your details? It is not so easy. Need a notary and then it must be deposited. Believe me, this cannot be done. So should I go there? Listen, it only takes one hour. - One hour! But at nine in the evening we have a plane! Maybe we'll finish earlier. But if we do not rise... As you say. You are a lawyer. And now, when you met, let's move on to reading the contract. Please settle down! So! The contract of sale is concluded according to the law between those present... Signorina Susan Anderson born in Louisville 04/24/1987, living at... ... and Signor Hugo Buchirossi, born in Figline Valdarno 08/12/1948, living at Filino Valdarno, Dante Street 22... Who are you looking for? - Artist Roberto Buriali. This is my dad, but he is not. And where he? In Arezzo, in the administration building. He is restoring one fresco there. Arezzo... - Let's go, we will not lose time! Chapter 4. The amount of the transaction - 10 million euros, which will be paid by bank check... Good afternoon! - Good afternoon. We are looking for Signora Roberto Buriali. It's me. Do I know you. You are the mother of poor Angelica. Yes it's me. We need your help. Of course. Please come here! ... from now on, the seller transfers to the buyer in the property the subject of this contract, that is, the castle, as well as everything in it... ... all paperwork costs assigned to the buyer. We have finished this question. It remains only to put a signature. This is how they park...?! - You are right, take care you! Come back immediately! I will call a tow truck! Call a tow truck! Signorina, look who calls it so boorishly. Signor. - Here it is, signed. - Thanks. As you allow yourself call so persistently! I'm looking for Susan Anderson. “Where are you going?” Can not wait, when it's over. Susan! - Not! - Susan! No, stop! Susan! You must not sign! How do you call yourself break into here? Signorina, take him out! - Leave me! But we agreed, see you no more! Who is this type? - This is a representative of the residents of the village. They have a lawsuit in court against my bride. But this has nothing to do with the castle... Signorina, you sign. Police will take care to throw him out of here... Susan, don't sign! This is a catch! You are a scammer. Who impersonates the duke’s son, to cash in on this sale. Duke's son? So he is the heir to Foskey? No, no... If there is also another owner, then I do not agree. I am a decent person and I want everything to be according to the rules... How decent are you? You are in collusion with Beruchchini’s lawyer, to rob Signorina Anderson. Susan, look at me. I tell you as a friend, as a brother... Listen, you have no right... - Shut up! Damn, look what you did! - He started it! Susan, there’s a mural in the castle, attributed to Leonardo. They hid her from you behind a wall of drywall. They rob you! I don't want to know anything else about this business. I'm leaving. Signor Bukirosi, this is a misunderstanding. I can explain everything. Believe me. “I just want to get home.” I'm not interested in the fresco, which I didn’t even see! Well done, well done! Listen to me, Signorina! Listen up! There is a fresco. When I studied at the Institute of Arts, I was sure that she belongs to the brush of Leonardo. Signora Biche said that not so long ago one expert confirmed this. Be ashamed! Go talk these tales are in another place otherwise the police will kick you out! They will arrive in a couple of minutes. - Like this. Who will arrive in a couple of minutes? - Police. You wanted to call her so I called! Call back and say that you were mistaken! I'll go, and you kick them all out of here! Hey my dear lawyer! You won’t go anywhere! Now we wait for the police. Meanwhile, listen to this signor. ... a call to lawyer Beruchchini’s office, someone is trying to prevent the sale of the castle, owned by signorina Susan Anderson... Susan Anderson? American? - Yes. Didn't she leave? - What do you say, lieutenant, let's go and see? Warn patrol mobile branches. Turn on the siren! Twenty five years ago I had the opportunity to see this mural. I was at Foskey Castle... restored one canvas which the duke was about to sell. And then, what happened 25 years ago? There was spring love... Angelica was fifteen I’m only eighteen. The Duke found us and kicked me out with threats. I was a boy... I didn’t have enough courage to object to him... and I escaped. Not listening to the entreaties of Angelica, who She said that she was expecting a child from me. I thought this was just an excuse... way to hold me back. But I didn’t notice anything. But I did not forget her. In a couple of years I came to find her. But it was too late. Angelica is dead. I always hoped that this child has found a family. It took me years to forgive myself. Meanwhile, the baby turned into a two-meter man. I can be this man...?! Oh my God! That means you not the duke's son! And does not flow in us kindred blood! This means that we can love each other... Susan, loving someone...? You are my bride... What's going on here? You on time. My shoulder is already tired. This man burst here like a thief. Arrest him! Take it, it’s still not charged. So... You can find out what's here happening, yes or no? Generally... Calm Please calm down! One by one, and try to understand something. Have you agreed? It all started with that diary that Susan found. Does this diary still exist? - Of course it does! Susan is right. Beruchchini hid it in your bank cell. You are welcome. Here it is, the diary! This is my daughter Angelica. I saved this... This is the second half of the photo. Ok i think that now everything is clear. But let me ask... This is irrelevant. DNA analysis to determine Vasco's biological father already done? 18 months later... How long are they there? The notary arrived more than an hour ago! Give them time. Transfer of ownership - this is a transfer of ownership! We need to confirm that we can stay in the village for 99 years free of charge. Help in the reconstruction of the castle - this is not empty talk to you...! Yes, I personally contributed two thousand euros! And who said that everything is needed to count as in the accounting report? Just think, Susan gave me wedding dress and holiday banquet... Instead of chatting go and see if they are finished! Long live the newlyweds! Congratulations! Bitterly! Bitterly! Bitterly! Dear Susan, when I wrote to you in Kentucky, I had no idea what this story can so nice to end. In truth, so am I. Howbeit, I need to go back to the office. This is out of the question! You stay to celebrate with us! Scourge? Vasco? Go to mom! What a pretty one! Is this your child? - Yes. What's his name? - Bartolo. Bartolo. Notary, this is my father. We will meet later. They are waiting for us. I'm glad you are not angry with me. - For what? For the fact that I said that this mural not written by Leonardo. Forget the fresco. Come, they are waiting for us. Father! Damn it you and your gun! The hunting season is over! I left the gun at home. I have to celebrate the wedding and the appearance of my first grandson! It seems like a fairy tale. But how notary assure that all this is true! Bitterly! Bitterly! Bitterly!
