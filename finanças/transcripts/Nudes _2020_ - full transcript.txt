Damn it. Damn it! Look. Did it break? No. But what would happen if it had? You’d die. For god’s sake. My whole life is in this cellphone. Come. - Let’s take a selfie. - My make-up. Come on. I want to post it. - Was it good? - Yes. I look gorgeous. Right? Yeah, sure. Maisa, is it coming? It says… 4 blocks away. No. So it’s pretty near. Is it blurred here? Holly shit, Adélia! What? Do you remember Isadora who studied with me? Isadora... - From high school. - I do. She has just posted a nude picture of her. On her friends group? No. Do you know these groups…? With everybody? Yeah. - Let me see it. - I think it was unintended. Poor girl. She is fucked. She is so fucked. - Where is the photo? - Here. She is hot! So what, Adélia? She is totally gorgeous. - Seriously? - She leak it on purpose. She has always been like that... - What do you mean? - I know her. And she is like that. Like that how? I don’t know… I think she leaked it on purpose. and sent an ad of the product. She is needing some sex Why would someone do that? Maisa… Can I tell you the truth? I just I think it’s really odd that someone does that. Why would someone take a nude picture in the first place? But think about it, It’s just a body. Ok, it’s her problem. Yeah, exactly. Thank God everyone lives their own life. Hey, it’s here. What? The naked girl? No… the car arrived. You're an idiot. Where were you? Leo, I told you I would go out with Adélia. I don’t like that girl. Can you tell me why? Because she is a bad influence on you. Seriously, Leo? Don’t bother me. You could’ve answered my texts. - I could, but I didn’t want to. - Ok,! Whatever... By the way... The can is on the furniture. Thank you. You welcome. Do you know Isadora from my High School? Yes. She posted a nude today. Unintentionally, I think. A nude? Yeah So embarrassing. I’m going to take a shower. Ok. Do you want some help? No. - Hi. - Is that the best you can do? No, I am better in live action. That was actually better. Am I being tested? Test drive. Drive-in? No? I'm sorry... ... I'm new at this app thing. You look so innocent. The face is not index... ... To the heart? ... to what matters. That's so witty. I like it. Could we do this by the phone? Sure. You’re all dirty. It's lotion. I see. You look so pretty in this robe. Leo I’m not in the mood right now. Is something wrong? No. No? Are you sure? I don’t know what you are talking about. I’m talking about... I’m asking if something has happened. Did I do something? I don’t know, did you? I don’t know, did I? I think you know what you'e done. I must have done something, but I don’t know what. You could tell me, right? Is it about sex? I really don’t know. Honey, tell me for God’s sake! We don’t have sex in ages! Maybe is something that you haven’t done. I was just now trying to do it. Trying to make love to you. Come here... I don’t want to talk about this now. I got to do my nails. You need to do your nails now? Do you need to have sex now? No, I want to. Well, I want to do my nails. Whatever. Leo? What? You need to take out the trash. Adélia? Heitor? Oh, sorry. Do you prefer bar or a coffee shop? A bar. I usually go to coffee shop nearby. Alright. It’s a bit early, right? To drink? It’s not that. and haven’t eaten since then. I had an early lunch today We can go to the coffee place. We can go to the bar as well. Coffee or bar? Sorry. It’s ok… Work... Do you have to go? It’s done. What? Nothing. It’s my chance now. your chance? To recieve my scaping text. I asked a friend to text me… …asking if you were boring or ugly so I could scape. What do you mean? Just like this message you got. No, but mine wasn’t… …wasn’t supposed to be obvious. You got me. No, but I'm about to. So, ugly and boring... or coffee? Bar. Great! Let’s go? Yeah. Are you coming? Yeah, of course. The red one I told you about. Right there! Red one, right? Do you think they have my size? Go in there and ask. They never have my size in these stores. You can go in there and ask… And sometimes it’s a bit tight on the shoulders. There is a sale’s woman over there. Do you want me to ask? You're so rude. What did I say? You're being weird. I’m not in the mood anymore. No? No. Can we eat then? Please! I’m hungry. You are always hungry. And you’re addicted to buy. And you only criticize me. Am I wrong? Yes. Oh, am I? You’ve told me you were buying one present to your mother. Look at this! I thought we were having fun together. I’m not having fun. I’m hungry. Yeah, I got it. Look who is there. Adélia! Hi Ma! Hey, how are you? Whats up? I’m fine, how about you? Fine as well. Leo. Hi. Hey what’s up? This is Heitor, guys. This is Leo. What are you doing here? We came for a walk. You? Buying a present to my mom. Really? I see. Is it her birthday? It is her wedding anniversary. I ended up buying other things too. You know me. You like wine, don’t you? I adore it. Just let me show her, really quick. This reminded me of you. It’s actually Leo’s. He loves wine. That is beautiful. Look how beautiful. It’s really beautiful. Actually, I don’t know… …What are you guys doing on Friday? You could come to our place. I think we can’t, right? Friday we have a… Friday is great! Cool! Friday is great! It’s all right, right Leo? Well, you have the glasses, we’ll bring the wine. Ok. Nice. And how is your mother? She is great. I miss her. Hey sweety. Can we go? Oh right, guys we were going to eat. We just had lunch.

I wanted to do. I liked it. It was sweet. Let’s go? Wait a second, Leo. I remembered that we didn’t take any photo today. Really? What’s the matter? One picture. Couldn’t we eat before? It's just a second. Smile! Cute. Did it hurt? No. No, right? Hi Ma! I'm so glad you're here. Are you ok? I am. Do you need help? No. Everything is under control. Let me check the bread. Oh! Wait, let me think… Oh darling, it burned. If I just remove this part here. No, I don’t think so. It's just the top... Nice wine. Say what? Was it you who choose the wine? Yeah. Sure. Good one. Is it Formula 1? Yes, F-1. Do you like it? Why? I love it. I have some miniatures on my office. Is that so? Yeah. I used to watch it with my dad. When I was a child And my uncles too. I remember until today Senna’s death. And they used to share Fittipaldi’s stories, you know? I do. I even meet him. Fittipaldi. My grandfather knew him. Seriously? It’s not working. No. Look here it isn’t ruined. I’m going to take a look in the fridge. And we can try to make something else. It's not ruined. We can try something new. I’ll call... Leo, honey, bring the wine! It’s coming! I started riding karts... but my sport has always been volley. Really? I used to play volley all the time. I was on my college’s team. You are kidding?! I swear! What did you major in? Linguistics. I did engineering. It suits you. You look like a linguistics guy! I went twice to the UNI Championship. The University’s Championships? On both times I drank myself out. Blackout? Where is my wine? I think there is no problem. Let me see it. It is not that dark. Give up. No I won't give up... There is no way, it looks like coal. Damn it. I almost burnt my hand. What now? I think I’m going to throw it away. Oh, this smell. Crap! I’ve ruined everything! No, you didn’t. I’m Sorry! Look at me! It’s all right! Let me say something important. No, just wait. I wanted this night to be nice. that we have a couple friend to hang out. For me it’s important and there is Heitor and Leo. You are my friend, I just wanted tonight to be perfect. But it’s working out. And I’ve ruined. Everything's fine. Then, you don’t know, the guy is naked… …With superman’s cape. The only thing missing was he wearing a tong. Hi. Hey. Your wine. What is this burnt smell? It is my fault... She opened the window! The smell is coming from the neighbor. How wonderful is this? Look at this. Ma, you were fabulous. It is awesome. Taste it. Guys, let’s make a toast? Try it, Leo. It’s delicious, Ma! Is it good? Let's make a toast? Lets! Wait, wait. Before we make a toast. so we can take a selfie! Let me grab my phone Really Ma? Is it always like that? Just a sec. A toast guys! Fist of many, I hope. Drink up. Heitor? What are you doing here? Ma? I’m working near by this place now. Really? Yes. Where? On that building on the corner. I also work nearby. Cool! and stooped here for a coffee. I just had lunch I have fifteen minutes yet. I’m also on my break. Join me. What a good coincidence. Yes, it's great. What are you reading? Ah, it’s nothing. Something silly. So, how is Adélia? since I last talked with her. It has been a while You two vanished. Wait a moment. Won't you tell me what are you reading? It’s a book. A book? Really? It is called Perfume. This book is heavy! Have you read it? I did. I've seen the movie as well. I didn’t know there was a movie. Yeah, but the book is way better. By the way, what a ending! I’m almost at the end. So I wont spoil it to you. No, you can tell me. What do you mean I can you? It’s nothing... You don't mind me telling you the end? I have this weird thing... It's nothing... I was just curious. it's just... For me... ... a book is like an experience... ... what it counts is to read, you know? There are some books that I… I’ve already read three – four times. When the book is good. And… For me, it is like a… Meditation, you know? It doesn’t make sense, right? No, it makes total sense! I do this with Dostoyevsky. Every time I read one of his books. I read it two or three times. Yeah. I’ve read it six times. Crime and Punishment. I’ve never read six times the same book. Have you read Crime and Punishment? No. Everybody talks about it, but I’ve never did. I’ll lend it to you. You must read it. I bet you’ll read it six times. Yes, probably. Do you always have lunch around here? Yes. I’ll bring it tomorrow. I’ll have lunch with Adélia. We all could have lunch together. That would be great. What about Leo? I’ll talk to him. He works a bit far from here. But I’ll ask him anyways. I have a meeting now. I must go. But I'll see you tomorrow . Sure, see you… Bye. Who still listens to CD’s? You even gave me these two. I do. What’s the problem? It’s just old fashioned. Old fashioned? Come on, you listen to vinyl. The sound is way better. You must agree with me. It’s true. You got to be kidding me. I’m not kidding. It’s way better. If only it played MP3... ... I could understand. But better sound? I don't think so. It’s better. Actually I think there is a blue shirt of in the wardrobe. On the second drawer. On the second drawer? Yes. Go check it out. Look, empty. I didn’t find my blue shirt, but I do have clothes here. I know. I didn’t know that I had clothes here. One more that I’ll give to you. This empty one. Do you want these CDs? Other wise I’ll throw them away. Throw it away? Yes. You are going to throw away something that still works? Why will I keep it, if I ain't using it? Just taking place in the shelve... Look at this one. Lets live together? Are you serious? You are laughing at me. Of course, I’m serious. Don’t you think it’s a bit soon? I got it! I am not trying to... You don’t want to take the cds with you! Stop it. It’s way easier. Don’t be silly. Of course not. I’ll take it away if you want. But I don’t know... I would like to move in and live with you. Ah. It’s too soon, isn’t it? I’m not asking you to marry me. I know. Adélia, stop for a moment. I’m done. What? Hun? What are you hiding over there? I’m not hiding… …it’s just a CD that I like. Which one is it? I love that CD! Me too. I don’t have it. This one I won’t give, lend or sell. No! This one has an emotional value. Emotional value? Yes. What is the emotional value? I was listening to this when I... What did you do? What’s that? That I had sex for the first time. Oh... I want it. No. Give me. I’m not going to. Come on, give it to me. I am gonna have to use force. You even took your glasses off. Oh, I’m so scared. Are you making fun of me? You’ll give to me. I won’t give it! It’s gone! I’ll find it. It’s not here. Let me go! It's finished! We won! Leo and Maísa won. What was that? Leonardo! Oh, sweety! Let me see it! I shoot her! Hey Ma! Come here! Let me see the mark! Cut it out! I wanna see it. I am leaving. Ma! I am not playing anymore. You cannot post this video! But it’s so funny… Do not post this video. Let’s go pay? Do you have the keys? You are funny in the video. You guys are so annoying… I liked the last part! I won’t play anymore… Look at the ending. I refuse to see it. Hey, don’t take too long. Ma… Heitor wants to move in. Really? That’s so cool! I’m so happy for you guys. But I don’t know if I want to. why? I don’t know. I won’t let you do this. I think it’s too soon. Dear… … hear me out. Heitor is a nice guy. He is good for you. Ok. and we are not living together, Ma. My neighbor is also a nice guy There is something going on, right? What? Is Carlos the reason? Of course not, it's not about him. Why then? I just think it’s going too fast. I don’t know. But did he give you an ultimatum? No, he just brought it out. That’s it then. You don’t have to do anything. You don’t have to do anything. I just think you should give him a chance. You two are good for each other, you know? I also think so. in this relationship with him. But I’m afraid to get stuck Let’s take a selfie. I thought you were going to hug me. I’ll hug you. I think you are only afraid to be happy. And I need to change these clothes. I can’t take it any longer, it’s too hot. When did you go? I went in 2002. Its way back. I wasn’t able to see the finals. But I did see Brazil vs Italy on the quarter-finals. I think it was 3 x 2 over the tie-break. That was when Brazil first won the World Championship? Yeah, it was. Of the World Campionship. Yes, of course. But I wasn't in the final. But you were there. You got to see something. I did. What were you doing in Argentina? I went backpacking with a friend. He invited me. I had just finished high school. I wasn't dating Maísa yet. Also I had not been accepted into college. So I was sorta free. Did you stay only in Argentina? No. We went up through chile, arrived in Peru... Then we came back passing trhough Bolívia. That's amazing, man. Best trip of my life. I can imagine. There's no doubt. It was the best period of my life. Actually, Really? Fuck... At last you came back. It was only two minutes... Where is the menu? We already ordered. Did you order for me? I did. I ordered for us. What did you get? A steak. You like it, don't you? It's so great you are eating what you want. I have something to share with you. Guys, We can cancel the order. No. Too late to cancel. No, no, no. It would take too long and I am hungry. Guys, I was about to tell you something. Go on. I’m going to be a godmother! We are going to be godparents. That’s nice, who’s? It’s my cousin’s daughter. You don’t know. But it’s cool, right? Pretty cool. I don’t think it’s cool to have children. How silly. it’s something very egocentric. I think I didn’t know you felt like this. Egocentric? Egocentric. I’ve never understood the need of making little copies of yourself. That's not what my friend who have children say. Quite the opposite. Anything to justify just that. Egocentrism. I think it’s great. For me, I would have kids know. But this one wants to wait. Leo... What? Don’t need to say this. it’s because you're not the one caring a burden in your belly. Nine months caring a ball. You are really against it. A child is not a burden. The illness, the back pain. because you fell sick all the time. You can't to go out I don’t think it's like that. I think man shouldn't even give an opinion. I think that man have to give an opinion. How so? As much as the woman. Why? What do you mean why? It is the women’s body. It's our life. We are the one to decide. We decide what we want. Kids, no kids. Abortion. Even decide if we want to have sex. You are joking. I am not. Yes, you are. Why do you think I’m joking? Abortion? You are serious. I am. It’s pathetic. Why pathetic? It isn’t your life. It isn’t your body. I don’t get this about women... Men have zero risk involved. May I talk? You may. I don’t get this women thing. To think that she can abort whenever she wants. Now if the man doesn’t want the baby and the woman wants… and the jerk has to pay pension. She just has the baby Can you explain this to me? And also he is called an inconsequent and some other shit. Are you serious, Leo? Yes, I fucking serious. Let’s evolve! Hey guys. Isn’t it that actor? Won’t you say something Maisa? who is in lots of movies now? Isn’t it that actor But which one are you talking about? I’m not seeing. I think that I mixed it up. did you know my cousin is an actress? By the way, Is that so? Is she on TV or theatre? Theatre. to make a living out theatre? Is it possible Leo! That's so stupid. Your comments are so stupid. Calm down, Adélia. I just asked. I’m curious. Can’t I be curious? Calm down guys. You can ask her. The premier will be next month. She is in a play. We can all go together. I love going to the theatre. That’s so cool. So? I don’t really like theatre. Leo… No. But I’ll go… Leo, I know something you’ll like. Can you get it for me please? interactive plays, right? It isn’t one of those Quit it, Leo. You’ll really like this! We never do anything. This does have interaction. We know It’s your birthday next month. But for you to use this gift, I had to give it in advance. Wow, a present? You don’t deserve it, but you’re getting it. at the publisher’s automotive section. A friend of mine works Automotive? And he got it for me. F-1? Formula 1. This is a ticket for formula 1? No. Not a ticket. Isn't it? It’s a free pass. What? Three days of free pass. to enter into Mercedes’ box. You’ll be able Really? Holly shit. That's awesome! That’s so cool. Did you like it? I don’t even know what to say. I loved it. Finally… You don’t have to say anything. Let’s make a toast. My juice didn’t come yet. The food is taking forever. Let me take a photo of you guys. Take a selfie. With all of us. Ok. Good. That’s great! the intention is the same. After all, for me, I don’t know. I don’t agree. is to depressing some times. I think Fernando Pessoa I wouldn’t use the word depressing. I would use the world he uses himself… ... Disquiet. He faces anguish. That's it. I don’t agree. But... Look. I like Vinicius de Moraes better. Period. Ok, but there is also anguish in Vinicius. I don’t know... ... Maybe you like him better... Because he says things in a softer way. Yeah, it’s really softer... what really bothers people. He prefers not to face What do you mean? Ok. It’s just my opinion, alright? For me, Fernando Pessoa... ... is a poet that chose to face Anguish up front. He didn't go around his darker side. Ok, exactly! What kind of person keeps looking and facing it's darker side? The Shadow is a part of us. Nobody is good all the time. I don’t know, Heitor! You’re making me feel like... about the world like that. I don’t like to think It's weird... Now I am anguished. My dad was just like that. Like what? Just like Fernando Pessoa. Depressed? No, anguished. He had this dream of being an artist. A poet. But his life took him in another path. Banking cashier. I think people are afraid to face their own shadow. They hide behind a curtain. People are too worried about… …about what others will think. Yes. That's probable it. I was going to say something else, but that makes sense. “I am nothing... I will never be... I can't desire to be... Besides that... all the dreams of the world.” I have in me Isn't it beautiful? "All the dreams of the world." Fernando Pessoa. And you only like Vinicius. Hey, I’m home. Hi honey. Look. I brought some cake. I brought cake for you. Thanks, you can leave it there. It's your favorite. Don’t you want to eat it? No honey, later. I brought it for you. I got that. "To Dream is the only thing that is really ours.” It's impossible not to love fernando pessoa. What is it? Nothing. Leo... I want to talk to you. Go ahead. I am not happy. Why aren’t you happy, Maísa? Are you sure you don’t want to eat? I already told you. Later. What are you doing? I’m going to eat it. Wait, wasn’t it for me? You don’t want it, Leonardo! I'll finish this, then I’ll eat it. If you are able to finish before I eat it. You are a piece of work. I’m a piece of work? Yes, you are, Maísa. Everything has to be as you like. That's bullshit! Bullshit? Maísa. Go have some fun at the mall. You are such an idiot. I am idiot? Yes. I stoped for one minute to… Fuck, …to play, to relax. Give me a fucking break. I was being serious with you. Stop pissing me off. Did you listen to what I told you? What was that you said? What do you want? Speak God damn it! I told you I am not happy. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do Maísa? Don’t you have everything you need? Do you want me to buy you more things? It’s not about that Leo. Oh no! I can buy my own things. I work. Oh, that’s true... I forgot. Why are you mocking me? Oh, for God’s sake. I bought the cake with my money. Oh, thank you. Why are you being so stupid? Oh Maisa. Give me a break. Ok then, just don’t complain when I am gone. It could be now. Yes! Hey Adélia Come here. on the bottom or on the top? Do you prefer the one It doesn’t matter. Come here. Can I keep the one on the bottom then? You can keep both. I take all my stuff back tomorrow. Just come here. Ok, you keep the one on the bottom. The one on the top is more practical. Would you stop for a minute, come here and stay with me. What is this? Cake, do you want some? Obviously. Are you putting anything else here at the living room? This cake is amazing. Ma gave it to me. Maísa? Yap. Shit, Maísa. I forgot. What? Friday What's on Friday? Card’s night. What do I do here? What do you do? Yes. You get the book and put it in the shelf. Everything is separated by topic. Topic? Topic and color. The top shelf cold colors, bottom shelf hot colors. For real? Yeah. Are you judging me ‘cause of the books? No! It’s not that. Heitor? Can we talk? Sure. Come here. I’ll fix it later. Yes, you will. Tell me. What is it? It’s just that everything seems odd to me. Odd? All of this, with you moving in. I was alone for a long time. I am used to having my own life. And you think I’ll mess that up? It’s not like that. It’s just that I conquered my freedom. I like to have control of my own doing. I like to be free to do what I want... ...when I want. A relationship will mess that up? That’s what I am afraid of. Look... Having a relationship is also a choice, you know? I know. this will be forever. I’m not saying But it’s an attempt. I’m not here to make you less happy. I want to make you happier. in th way of your freedom. I don’t want to get I want to boost you. You're cute. must make things better. For me a relationship What’s the point of it? Or else... That’s my point. I want you close to me. I want to be together... but I also want my freedom. I want to do things whenever I fell like… Ok, but too much freedom becomes debauchery. Are you saying I am a debaucher? No, no. I want to understand… I am not going to fuck some random person. I didn’t do that before. Why now? Then explain. I don't know what you are asking for. I am talking about an open relationship. It's like that cookie before lunch... I couldn’t wait for the lunch to finish so that I could eat the cookie. Do you want the cookie? I want lunch. But if someone prohibits me from eating the cookie… Then I want the cookie... Look, ok De. I’ve never done this before. But we can try it. Ok? Is that it? That’s it. Darling… Hey Wait, where is Heitor? He is late. He sent me a message. Should I put it in the wine cooler? Lets drink it. Ok then, do you want to open it now? Where is Maísa? Is she home? No, she hasn’t arrived yet. but you can stay here with me. I am just going to finish this. Can I open it then? Go ahead. What are you cooking? I’m making an eggplant pate... ... with cherry tomatoes and oregano. Fancy. What’s the main course? Falafel. Hum, falafel? Falafel. It just made my mouth water. You bought it? No, I made it. Come on, you made it, Leo? Of course I made it. Tell me another lie. You obviously bought it. No! Taking them out of the packaging... ... is not the same as making. I followed a recipe! You are all dressed up. How come you were cooking? I took it off because you rang the bell. Come here, let me help you. Come here. What is it? I’ll tie you up. I think I’m alright… Ok then. Look. it’s looking really good. It looks great. I’m wonIt looks great. good? I’m wondering if it is good? I'll try it later. Let’s drink some wine first. Weren’t you… Wait, stay here. A toast. Chears. A tost to them who are late and to us who are here. Yeah. But tell me, how did you make it? I got the recipe from the internet. Internet? Yep. Did you follow it right? I obviously followed it right. You obviously did. So it can be good. Leo Why are you like that? Like what? Uptight. Always doing the right thing... Why? I don’t know. My mom didn’t think so. Oh no? No. Neither does Maisa. Now everything makes sense. I figure it out. to avoid disappointing your mother. You always do the right thing Oh Therapy? it’s not therapy. It’s just a comment. How about you? Was your Father an absent parent? Why are you hitting me back? Maybe that’s why you don’t trust men, is that it? No, it’s not that. I just think men are douchebags. Nothing to do with my father. Nothing. I think you like douchebags. Heitor isn’t a douchebag. Yeah, Heitor isn’t a douchebag. What is that? This is tahini. Look. Now you can properlly smell it. Sorry. You're an idiot. Wait, it’s still dirty. Yeah, Heitor isn’t a douchebag. You’re a douchebag. Me? Yes, you are. Am I? You’re a douchebag. I’m probably your type then. What did you say? I am your type. Hey, I’m home! Hey, we are here! Where are you? In the kitchen. I brought tequila! Look what my love made. Lier. - A falafel! - He didn't do it. - He bougth it. - they say it's a lie. But I believe him. I'm too hot. ¡Arriba, abajo, al centro, adentro! One more! What is it? Left hand on the red. - But it already is. - What do I do? Take it off. My turn. Spin the bottle for me, please. I think it’s not big deal, I find it very nice. Is it not a big deal when a guy dates two? - Not two, there were three at some point. - No! There’s a moment he’s with three. Open your mind, would you? It’s just a movie, ok? I don’t want your feet here anymore. Nothing to worry about. Thats right, it's just a movie. I think it’s alright to date two girls. I think it’s cool. I don't mean me. I don’t even like the movie. It’s not his best work. His best is Midnight in Paris. - Shut up! - Yeah! - I think so too. - It's poetic. because of Scarlett Johansson. Vicky Cristina Barcelona I knew it! - Yeah. She's so pretty! - She is gorgeous. She is not pretty. She is hot. It’s true! The thing is... I wish I had her body. That’s why I said she is hot. I think you're hotter. Yeah, right! Let me say something. It’s important. Maybe she is hotter, but you are prettier. You're right, and I would fuck her. I wouldn’t mind watching that. And I'd like to participate. We should to go to Hollywood for that. - Yeah, lets go! - I wouldn't! I wouldn't go. I’ll to tell you the truth. Be careful with that drink. Watch out for my sofa. No way I would make out with a girl. Maisa, Don’t be silly! You kiss that idiot every day. Hey, fuck you! That’s not true. Men are different. What’s the difference? - It's different. - A beard? No, we are different. Get out with that same sex shit. you’ve never felt attracted to… Are you saying ... someone of the same gender. Never! - Look, I’ve never... - Yeah, right! ... seriously, I can look at a guy.... ... and say: He is hot. - I’m even a bit jealous of the six pack. - You see! He is hot? but not sexual attraction... oh fuck... What? You think a man is hot?? Well, can't you see when...? You're jealous cause you're a little fat. You are so gay. - What a douchebag. - Totally. - He doesn’t even know these things exist. - You're fag! You like harry nipples. Stop, he is a flexible straight guy. No, I’m kidding. I’ve already kissed a guy. You liked it... what? I’ve already kissed a dude. It's true. He kissed a dude. - It's a lie! - I did! I swear I did! Tell us all about it. It was new year’s eve. I was hanging out with some alternative people. I was drunk. They dared me to do it, so I did. - We weren't together yet. - Were you drunk, Leo? - Were you drunk? - I was very drunk. - What about now? Sorta. Kiss Heitor then. - Come here! - No. - He is not my type. - Whats the deal? That’s 'cause you don’t know this tongue. Let me see it. No! Stop it! I think we relate to people, not to gender... It’s just a body. I agree. He didn’t even pay attention to what I said. She said it isn’t a matter of gender. I already got in love with people because of their intellect. With people? - Man, woman... Transgender... - See? in an open relationship... That’s why I believe And not in marriage. - Ah, okay Adélia. - It’s true. It’s very easy for you to talk about it. I wonder how it would be if you had one. Who said I don’t have one? What do you mean? You two are dating for like twenty years. You met at kindergarten. You’re fucking for many years with the same person. That’s not healthy. I don’t really share that opinion, but I respect it, honey. but you do as you please. I don’t agree, Guys, seriously. Give her some water. Do you never wanted to have sex with another guy? I’m not talking about that here. - Leo, you’re attracted to other girls... - Quit it, Adélia! - But it's ok for men! - You’re drunk. You're being rude, honey. - Let's change the subject. - I doubt it! I don’t want to drink water. - Don't throw up in my living room. - Drink some water. You’re going to be sick. You drank a lot. Are you going to throw up? - Oh, no! Come with me! - I might. Give her some water. let’s go to the bathroom. Help me out girl, It was the falafel you did, Leo. The tequila had nothing to do with it. Yeah, right. Open relationship? Yap. That’s something cool, hum? How did you do it? How did I do? Iwish I had one of those, dude. I don’t think you would. I mean it. There is to much stress. that can race for multiple teams. It’s probably like a driver Run for ferrari and Benetton... Ma! Hey! - You are wearing glasses. - What’s up? Yes, I have to use them now. I can’t see as well as I imagined. I have 0.75 and 1 in the other. I see. Yeah, I'll have to use them now. But you look beautiful. Do I? It looks great on you. Thanks. You should wear it more often, you look... Smart and sexy. Yeah. That's it. Do you mind if we go a bit faster today? I need to get back to the office. Ok. No problem? I already ordered for you, a capuccino. You did? Oh, how cute. But tell me, what are you reading now? It’s a Novel. A novel? Who would’ve figured right? So? I don’t know. I think I’m not so romantic anymore. What happened? Why? You... What? We always end up talking about my problems. I like hearing you talk. I know you do. Sometimes I feel I take advantage of you. I don't mind. No? Nope. So, tell me. I think... ...there is something that I wanted to tell for a while now. It's... hum… it’s hard. You can tell me. I had an abortion. When? I don’t know… I don’t even remember. About a year... It was just before I met you. When we all started hanging out together. Actually it was good... We all started hanging out. I thhink my relationship would ended right there. Leo didn't want to have it? No, Leo never... Leo never got to know about this. Doesn’t he know about this? I didn’t have the courage to tell him. But did you lose it? Was it spontaneous or….? I did it. Why did you do it? Ma... ...come on… Tell me. Why? I don’t know. I’ve never… I don’t… I… I think that… I love Leo. Truly. But it didn’t feel right. I don’t know if we were capable. You should tell him. Yeah, I didn’t want to. He is your husband. He has the right to know this. Yeah, I feel guilty. If you feel guilty, there is still time. Tell him. It’s not like that, Heitor. He wouldn’t understand it now. You scared of facing this situation. How so? You are afraid to face this situation. You are like that. You hide yourself... Keep it down please. I look at you. Do you face the situations? This is not about me Maisa. IIt’s about you. Exactly. It’s not about you. You always know what others have to do. What do you want me to do? You throw this bomb over me. And you want me to say nothing. I thought you would hear me ... and understand me. I am trying to understand you. But I’m not a confessionary. Keep it down. Maisa, you can tell me whatever you want. But I have the rights to have an reaction. You expect me to be quiet? Is that too hard? Fuck yeah. Of course it’s hard. I guess I apologize. I didn’t mean to bother you. Will you run away again? Can’t you see that this is... Keep it down. ... this is what’s ending your relationship? There is nothing ending my relationship. Maísa. (Hi Honey.) (hey) We should stop doing this. because we've just fucked. You’re saying that And then you’ll get horny again and call me. That's what happens Leo. Isn't it? Yes. By the way Leo, you have to call me. You shouldn't send me emails. It is too evident by email. Ok. Someone could caught us. (I want to go out. What do you say?) (Go out? I don’t know. Why?) Has Ma set something up with you? We agreed not to talk about them. I know, but... She just scheduled something for saturday. (I wanna do something just the two of us.) I’m bringing that wine. By the way Leo, You know that one you like. I do like it. So. Where does Heitor buy it from? Heitor? Yes, I always forget to ask. I’m the one who buys it. Heitor knows nothing about wines. I thought it was him. Can we stop talking about them? I dont know... Can we? (I’m tired.) Do you want to fuck again before you go? (Pizza?) What? Never mind. No, I do. Do you? (Yay! I love you.) Darling Yes... Have you seen my car keys? I’m late. I think it could be in my purse. And where is it? I don’t know Heitor. Look for it, I’m in the shower. Your phone is ringing. Hello, Leo? Heitor? Hey man, whats up? I’m fine and you? Me? I’m good Do you need to talk with Adélia? She is in the shower now. Well... No.. It’s just that… I think that I miss called. Miss called? Well, okay then, I have to go. Okay. So… Cool! Then see you on saturday, right? Yes! Saturday, it’s a pub, right? Yes, right! I’ll see you there then. Bye bye! There's a poster of John Coltrane. Have you heard him? But I hadn’t seen that picture there. I did. Guys, I’m a bit bored here. Guys... You are bored. Why are you bored? This pub is boring. I don’t know. And empty. We could always go home. I think we could have one more... And then we decide. Thanks. We think this placê is boring. A bit empty right? Yeah. Yes, kind of... Kind of... I don’t know. At least we are not standing like in that crowded pub downtown. Downtown is always like that. But the bartender was telling me. There will be a show down stairs shortly. Yeah? - it will get better. - Show? Yes. No, guys. that I’m not into this things. Leo, you know Let’s go home? I’m not in the mood for a show. We could play a game back at home. A game! Game... What will we play? Game is a good idea. - Have you paid for the beers? - It’s paid. Ok. Shall we? let me post the photo. Just a minute, So, what will we play? Canasta? Oh no, not Canasta. We always lose on Canasta. What is the score? Hum... It’s 8x1? There it is, we always lose. 8x1? That’s unfair. I don’t want to play like that. - Okay we can reset the score. - Let’s reset? So I thought we drop by the marketplace… … to get some finger foods and wine. - Wine? - Yes. We always get wine... We don’t… We could try something other than red... Champagne? - Let’s have Champagne! - Great! Champagne. We could have that one we... ... Yeah that fine brut... I like it! Do you remember? Sure. What was the name of the...? What if we change pairs? Change pairs? Yes. Why? and I’ll play with Maísa. You play with Adélia You don’t want to lose another one, right? What do you think? You get to be with Leo and I with Maísa? I think it could be. Right? I rather play with you. Hum… me too. I also rather play with you. I rather play with Ma. No, calm down! It will be nice. resetting the score, right? You were talking about It doesn’t make sense to reset it. Why to count it then? New pairs, new score right? - Alright... - Cool. But we could end up fighting... - We could play another game. No guys, we are grown ups. No fight. Nice. Right Ma? - Play an individual game. - Right. - Then there is no fight. - No, come on. Maisa, what do you think? Whatever. Let’s get going? - I’ve already posted here. - It will be fun. - Lets go. - I'll get the car. - Sure. I’ll leave this beer here. I am so bored. (What the fuck?) Get her beer. Are you having it? Yes. What was that all about? what you’re talking about. I don’t know It was ridiculous. what you’re talking about. I don’t know Stop acting like an idiot. You know what I’m talking about. Okay I do know. You know, don’t you? I know everything! Everything. what you’re talking about. I don’t know Oh no? Stop it Adelia, come on. What is it? Just admit it. What do you want me to admit? Leo? Really? What about him? You're fucking him. Wasn't there anyone else in the city? - Tell me how could this be my fault. - It’s your fault. Oh, you know it Heitor. - I know shit Adelia. - Don't you? - You fell in love with Maisa. - No, I don’t. - Are you kidding me? - Really? Maísa? - You must be delusional. - Fuck you! You're throwing things at me. You are crazy! Do you think I‘m stupid? Do I look stupid to you? There is nothing going on between me and her. I see the way you look at each other. You have lunch together every day. I can’t believe it! Just because I... Just because you think something is happening. You just fuck with Leo. Is that your answer? What the fuck Adelia! You are a moron. is that what you think? - Yes, you are a moron. - I am not. Is that so? that you didn’t fuck Maísa. So tell me - No I didn’t fuck Maísa. - Oh really? No, I didn’t. Now you tell me. Tell me you didn’t fuck Leo! Heitor? Heitor? Is everything alright? Sit down. You seemed weird in the message, I got worried. I have something to tell. - Ok. You can tell me. - I don't know how. it’s better if I don’t. You know, cause I’m too confused. You better leave, it’s all right. I came here to talk to you. So tell me! Didn’t you notice it? Where is your mind? What are you talking about? the world is not a romantic novel! I’m saying that Why are you talking like that? Because that’s what you need! You need to wake up! I didn’t come here to be offended. No, wait! God dammit Heitor, are you stupid? - What’sthe matter with you? - I'm sorry. I need you to understand me okay? Look... Spit it out! Okay, we already talked about this, Heitor. They are having an affair. - That’s it. - What? Leo and Adelia are having an affair. Heitor… Are you listening to yourself? Of course I’m listening. I’m saying it. My chair is all wet. Do you have any proof? Adelia confirmed... She confessed yesterday. I’ve noticed They were acting weird. They were closer together. So I checked her phone. They were talking every day. They meet every day to fuck. So I confronted her and she confirmed. I don’t believe it. Of course, why would you? Yes… you could be making this out. Why would I do this? - Tell me why would I make it out. - Keep it down. I don’t know… Because you're in love with me. - Get out of your delusional bobble! - Are you not? That tiny bobble that you live in. This fiction you live in. Let me explain you something. I'm a woman. ok? I feel things... - I am not an idiot. - Oh do you? Adelia could have… What guarantees that Adelia... ... also didn’t realise something was going on? She said that to give you a lesson. - Because this meant something to you. - Yeah sure. I’m just going to tell you one more thing. This is just a distraction. - Everything is a distraction to you. - Maybe it is. Go away, go hide. Why don’t you take a selfie now? Show the world how you thruly are… Do you want make a scandal? Here! This is your scandal. You can live with that now. Maísa... Is that you? I don’t even know anymore. I was thinking about going to the park... Leo sit here for a moment. - Sit down? - Yes Are you going to stare at me like an idiot? - Sometimes you act like a crazy person. - Well, I am. You have something to tell me. I’m not in the mood for a fight. You can do that by yourself. You like turning things right at me. Stop pissing me off, Maisa. Did you cheat on me? What? What are you talking about? Are you high? Yeah, I’m high. It’s a simple question. Did you cheat on me? Who do you think I am? That’s what I’m trying to figure out. I wouldn’t do that to you, ok? Maísa... - You wouldn’t? - No. I don’t know. I’m asking cause I don’t know. I don’t fuck you when you want. You’re always complaining There you go... That's something it’d be nice to talk about. - You want to talk about that? - Could I know why? I want to know why you don’t want to have sex with me. Can you explain? You’re not answering my question. Neither are you. I asked it first. Answer Leo, it’s simple. Okay, I’ll be clearer. Are you fucking Adélia? - Yes, Adélia. - Adélia? Where did you get that from? - Cause you are pathetic. - Why are you laughing? Answer my question. What’s the question? If you're fucking my friend. No, I am not. - Are you sure? - I am positive. Okay then. So I can take… Can have a look at your phone? Won’t I find anything here? if I check the calls out? So? Can I look? Why Leo? Maísa... Why did you do it? You had no reason. How could you do this? How did you have the guts? Tell me how. Won’t you say anything? Won’t you say anything? What do you want me to say? I want you to say anything. That it was wrong! That you didn’t mean to do it... It was wrong. Why? Say something! Because she wanted me. Because she wanted me, that’s why. Is that your answer, Leo? It’s obvious that she wanted you. Maísa. Someone wanted me. I don’t know if you get it. Someone wanted me. To fuck me. And liked to fuck me. She was happy fucking me and... Stop being ridiculous! Why are you saying that? Do you know how long I’m… ... that I’m being ignored? At least she wanted me. - How long have you been doing this? - For God’s sake! Are you deaf? I’m talking to you! I love you! I didn’t want her, I wanted you. but you haven’t been around for awhile. You know what? I got married to a monster. You are a monster. - A monster? - Yes. And what are you? I am... I... I’m a whore. You know why? Because I fucked all of your friends, Heitor included. You're not for real. - Let me say something. - Maisa come here... - Calm down. - Look. Sit down. I don’t want you to be here when I get back. That's what I want. Maísa... - Excuse me, Leo. - I love you. Your t-shirt is wet. I know. I’m glad you’re back. I live here. ... for now. You do. I still do. What is it? What I’ve done has no excuse. - I didn’t want to hurt you. - What'd say? I didn’t want to hurt you. Oh, you didn’t? No. Looks like you did. Did it? It does. Give me a reason. Just one. what you want me to say. I don’t know Give me a reason. I don’t know what to do. I want you to give me a reason why... ... I shouldn't to go out that door and never come back. That's what I need. My father… He used to take me once a month... ...to my grandparents’ house in the countryside. What do I have to do with that? Will you let me tell it? Your father used to, bla bla bla... We would go there... and return on sunday after lunch. ...every friday night I… do you mind? I'll get it for you. there was a pool and an orchard… There was awesome, neighbours’ daughters. I had a few friends, We used to have so much fun. I loved it because my dad was there... ... I barely ever saw him. and I thought that was awesome. We slept in the same room My grandparents used to spoil me. My favourite foods, my favorite games. with all that, Adelia? What do I have to do And then on Sundays... ... usually, I cried. Did you cry? I cried. I cried because I didn’t want to leave. One day I cried so much that… I got to stay. I convinced them to let me stay. But my dad didn’t stay. Then I got scared of sleeping alone. And ended up sleeping with my grandparents. because I was missing my mom. I cried a lot And I cried so much... for so long... ... that one day I stopped crying. Why did you stop? Because I understood. What did you understand? Tell me. What? I understood that I would never be completely happy. How so? Everything is very apart inside me. Half of me wants to go and half wants to stay. Half wants to cry and half to laugh. I am not following you. I’ll be happy and I’ll cry. If you want to stay, But if you want to go, I’ll also cry. So it doesn't matter? No! It’s not it doesn't matter. Have some water. I don’t want to. Give it to me. I’ll always lose something incredible. Okay, but then what? Then what? You are amazing. So are you. And I love you. But the decision must be yours, not mine. I want you to stay. But I also like to be alone. you’ll have to know that. If you stay, I don't know what to do. Me niether. I never know. Look. Okay, Adélia. I do know what I want. What I want is not to have an open relationship. I want you and me, that’s it. Are you willing? Yes. Really? Ok. What about your freedom? Really? Come here. Oh, right... What? I kind of told Maísa. Seriously? Yeah, seriously, I told her. I can’t believe it. What? Did you really do that? Yes. Won’t you open it? I better do it, right? - You should. - Yeah! Go. just thinking about one thing. I came all the way from home how come a friend could do this? I thought, But then I realized. You don’t like me. You were never my friend. The world doesn’t spin around you. Neither around you, you bitch. It doesn’t need to be like this. It does! Because when you decide to fuck my husband... I can do it however I want it. Don’t you think? Actually, I should kill you both. Grab a knife now. Kill you and … - Don't touche me! - Stop it. You can’t even kill an ant. I’m really pathetic. The truth is I really can’t. I wish! But I wanted to say, you know. I wanted to tell you this. I can’t believe it, Adélia. I'm like... I can’t believe. Because II’m not only losing my husband. I’m losing my best friend too. He won’t leave you, Maísa. I’m not like you. I can’t accept that. Believe me, you don’t… You wouldn’t like to be like me. I think I would. I would have more freedoom. Maybe I could do more things that I enjoy. Maybe fuck with somebody’s husband without caring. Why? Why did you do it? Because I am shity selfish person, that’s why. That’s why. I was so afraid to lose Leo. I still am afraid to lose him. That’s even more ridiculous. Because I’m under thirty years old and I’ll be divorced. It’s really pathetic. It is also pathetic to be over thirty and not be married. I don’t think so Adelia. you never wanted to. It was your choice. And didn’t you choose to marry? Wasn’t it? You’ve hurt me, my friend. I know. I’m sorry. I know that what I’ve done has no explanation. I’m so sorry. It doesn’t. The worse is that I’m so lost now. what I’m going to say to my parents. I don’t even know - My mom will be so disappointed with me. - Ma? - There are also my friends from work. - Calm Down. Look at me. What is it, Adélia? Stop it! Look at me. Stop caring about others. our school’s message group. Send a nude on Take some risks in life. A nude? Yes, #NUDES. #NUDES - Hi. - Hey. So, how are you? Fine.
