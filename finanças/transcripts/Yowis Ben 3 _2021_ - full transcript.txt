SOLO CITY MANAHAN STADIUM SRIWEDARI STADIUM, SOLO ALL-AROUND JAVA TOUR Mia, where's your baby? Huh, where's my baby? Oh, he's with his father. Mia, your husband's in the makeup room. Goodness gracious, I left my baby on the bus! Darn! No time to take pictures for IG! - It's the last! - Hey! Last city! Are you guys ready? We have to perform well. Chairs with our names on them. - Cool, right? - Bay, what's his problem? Mr. Dono. Hey, come here. - What's wrong, Bay? - Here, please read the name. - Doni. - Who's sitting there? Maybe your dad? Huh? No. It can't be my dad. What are you looking at? Nothing, sir. Give it up, Don. His hair's all white. Let this elderly man sit here. - But, I... - Wait, let me take care of the fans. They're coming in. Just a moment. Hey, get out! I'll bite your neck! Get out! - Bay. - Sir, excuse me. What? Who are you? I'm about to get on the stage. So are we, sir. We're all performing. Who are you people? We're the band. What band? I don't know you. Please, look this way... Where? Wait, miss. Let me see what this kid wants. See? "Yowis Ben." That's my poster. Bayu. I sit here. And that's Nando. Here's Nando. This one. Oh, right. You're the same. - And Yayan is that one, sir. - Right. There's Yayan. Yayan. Goodness, what's with your poster, Don? Just a moment, sir. - Doni. - That one's me, sir. This is his seat, sir. Look, "Doni." Just wait. I have to get on the stage. Wait until this lady finishes doing my makeup. Miss, let's finish this. - Are you a magician, sir? - A magician? What magician? - We're done, sir. - We are? All right. I'm getting on the stage. I need to earn money. - Sir, wait. - Now what? You forgot your hat. Yowis Ben? I've never heard of your band. Who was that? Probably a rain pawang. - Mr. Ustad. - What, Di? Will the weather be good? Don't you know who I am? I apologize, sir. Just making sure. Thank goodness, today's weather will be good. Well, not necessarily. - What do you mean, Mr. Ustad? - Prayer is important. And behave yourself. Leave everything to Allah. Have faith! Guys, make sure everything's good, okay? - All right! - All right! - How's the sound? Good? - Good? Bro, let me check the lights. Okay! Good, they're all good. Awesome! What do you say, Mr. Ustad? All good? By Allah's will, all is good. This is good. I think I'm confident. If you're confident, be confident. Don't say "I think." Are you confident? I'm confident! - I think. - Huh? How nice it'd be if they served us pizza at every stop of our tour. I missed my mother's pecel rice in Malang. Be patient, dear. You'll be home soon. You can eat all the pecel you want. You're right. Doni, your parents sent you tumpeng rice. Dad, Mom, you shouldn't have. Thank you. Right, Don. Your mother and I are proud of you. Dear. Don, we actually want to ask you for a favor. What favor, Dad? Please transfer me some money. Yes. After the concert, I will stop by the ATM. Right now if possible, Don. I really need the money. Mia, you forgot your stroller. - Where's Mia, Yan? - The toilet. Stev, why isn't Nando getting his makeup done? Nando is handsome. He doesn't need any makeup. What are you looking at, Nando? No, it's... Uh... I'm chatting with my dad. He says hi. - Really? - Yeah. - Husband! - Yes, Mia? Singo bit me! - What? - Huh? What did Singo bite, Mia? Come here and see for yourself. Right. Ouch! Husband, it hurts! Calm down, I'm trying. Don! Don't get any weird thoughts. Singo is their kid. But what did Singo bite? That's important, Bay. Gosh. DRESSING ROOM Guys. Hey! - It's time. - Okay, Uncle. - It's time. - Is it time, Mia? What are you saying, Don? Watch your mouth! - Mi! - Hey! Focus! Yeah, it's time, Bay. Asih, I'm going on stage now. - All right. You have to perform well. - I will. - Okay. This one? - Okay. It's time, Nando. Yeah, it's time. All right, Stev. I'm going on stage. Go get them, Nando. They left already? Of course, Yan. It's time. Hurry up. Is he done biting you? Wait. Of course, he bites, his name is Singo. How are you going, Solo? - Fine! - Fine! How are you going, Indonesia? - Fine! - Fine! Today we will watch the performance of the band... What was the name? Who is the MC? Why are you asking me, Jon? Then who am I supposed to ask? Makes me emotional. Don't hold me back, Ustad. Who's holding you back? Please welcome Yowis Ben! So you're the performing band. You, sir? - Can you play well? - Yes, we can, sir. We're Yowis Ben, sir. From East Java. You are awesome. I thought you were performing. Turns out you're the MC. I'm the most famous MC in Central Java. Is that so? Without me, you wouldn't have been invited to perform here. - True. - That's right. Who's the MC? He makes me emotional. You have to calm down. But such a small crowd. Not even 100 people. Actually, I have another MC job in Manahan Stadium. They're having a huge concert. - Great bands. - Right now? Right now, at the same time as this event. That's why we only have this small crowd. Hello, Dad. I'm at the concert. Yes, after the concert, I'll return straight to the hotel. Let's watch the performance by Yowis Ben. - I have to go to Manahan. - Yowis Ben. - Bigger paycheck. - Yowis Ben. - Yowis Ben. - Yowis Ben. Wait, you're from East Java, right? - Yes. - Watch it. Play well, jerk. Hey, crappy MC! You suck! - Calm down, Mia. - Calm down, Mia. The first time I looked upon your face There are sparks inside my heart... It's them, bro. My favorite band, Yowis Ben, with their song "Gandolane Ati." To you I've been searching... - Interesting pop-punk genre, huh? - Yeah. I'm positive that they can attract a huge audience that will buy my drinks. Awesome. You are the one in my heart... YWB SQUAD NANDO, I CAN'T SLEEP I'm getting goosebumps. This song was inspired by the guys' loved ones. Where's your loved one, Jon? What are you saying, Ustad? You're ruining my mood. I promise you, I will make it happen The truth is, I love you There'll be no one else, I swear to you I've been searching Now that I've found you I'm not lying You are the one in my heart... Bro, what kind of band is this? I came all the way from Kebumen just to see this? Gosh, what a waste! ...in my heart Bro, aren't you sorry for your mother? Tattoos all over, punk hair, and listening to this? It's my hobby. I'll smack you with this flask! I'll hit you with this! Taking me to a crappy concert! Shut up! Stop fighting! Let me sell these drinks in peace! The one in my heart I've been searching Now that I've found you I'm not lying You are the one in my heart I've been chasing Until my life breaks apart I'm not lying You are the only one in my heart - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! I've been searching Now that I've found you I'm not lying You are the one in my heart I've been chasing Until my life breaks apart I'm not lying You are the only one in my heart - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! So tense. I bet you ride your bicycle a lot. - Sir. - Yes? I'm here. - Where? - My feet are here. Then what am I massaging? Where? - Here? - That's right. Lower. Still a virgin I see. - Uncle Jon. - Yeah. It's time. Time for what? Sucking what? It's time to eat. Eating your hand? Whatever! They're waiting for you. Yeah. - Sir. - Yeah. Who was that? - Kamidi. - Who's Kamidi? You wouldn't know him anyway. I never thought I would eat meals like this. True. "Sepa dikareti." It's spaghetti! Dutch noodles. - Wrong again. - Jon. Don, where are the kids? They just went to have some fun. It's boring to just stay in the hotel room. They're big boys. Don, you're a celebrity bodyguard. Why are you just sitting here? What if anything happens to them? Look, Uncle. There are four of them. There's one bodyguard. You think I'm an amoeba that can split itself? Like that? What about you, Di? Why didn't you take them shopping? There are four of them and only one bus. Should I have given them each one tire? Like in the circus? Like this? I'm sure it would be boring for them, being on the bus after a month. Mr. Ustad didn't go with them? There are four of them and one of me. I just prayed for each one of them. That's enough. The kids said goodbye to me. They wanted to walk around a bit, each with their own loved ones. Is that so? Fine then. - What? - Where are you going, Jon? - Looking for some fresh air. - We're coming! Why are you coming? - Because we're your loved ones. - We're your loved ones. Loved, my ass. Uncle Jon. Sir? No sound at all. Must've fallen asleep. My massage technique is the best. Our ancestors were sailors. Do you want to go for a swim? All right, you want to swim? - Husband. - Singo wants to swim? Yes, our boy wants to swim. But Singo can't swim yet. That's why you should go with him. Oh. Fine, I'll check if it's deep or not. Look. Daddy. How is it, husband? Is it deep? It's safe, Mia. It's just a bit... wet. Ouch! Husband, calm down. Let it go. Mia, help me! She's coughing. No, sir. I'm making batik. - Yes, sir. - Okay then. Marion. Doni, you're here. - Great timing. - Yeah. - Do you like batik? - Of course, I do. I'm looking for one for your future father-in-law. - What a coincidence. How nice of you. - Of course. All right, let's try some. This one? This is too big for me. And I prefer more colorful ones. That's right, colorful. This one suits you. Nice. You sure know what's good for me. Dear, have you found one? Dear, I've found one. Doni helped me pick them. - Sir. - Yes, Sir Officer. - All right. - My boyfriend. All right. Thank you for helping me pick the shirt. If you're looking for souvenirs, they have a lot at the back. - Okay? - Yes, I know that. - Bye. Let's go, dear. - Take care. She used me to fit shirts! Damnit! Thank you, sir. What are you watching? Smiling like that? Nothing, Stev. It's this arrogant basketball player. He claimed that he can shoot from anywhere. It's not important. I think he's lying. Can I see? So what did you order, Stev? We have kolang-kaling, serabi pancake... I'm curious, Nando. Curious about their taste, right? All right, try it. It's still inside the plastic, Nando. I forgot. - So that was... - Here, try it. Everything I choose gets taken away. Shirts. Girls. I'll take this one. Hey, damnit! What? Grumbling by yourself? Alisa, why are you here? Are you with your dad? No, my dad's at the hotel. Then what are you doing here? I just watched Yowis Ben's last concert. Before I go back, I stopped for some souvenirs. - Souvenirs? - Yes. - For your boyfriend? - No. - So? - For my husband. What? Your dad married you off already? No, I'm just kidding! Gosh, her dad's mean and she likes to joke. Be serious once in a while. - Coughing, ma'am? - No, I'm making batik. I'm making batik. I've told you many times, I'm making batik. Very well. She's coughing. The red-faced one is Ravana. He kidnapped this girl, Sita. When Sita already has a lover. - What? - It's true. His name is Rama. This Ravana is such a bad guy. The white one is Rama's friend, - The White Munyuk. - Munyuk? Munyuk means ape. The White Ape, Hanuman. He helps Rama take Sita back. They're fighting. The ultimate weapon. He's shooting the arrow. It's over now. Great show. Asih. Would you like to be the Sita of my heart? But Sita is different, dear. I just want to be myself. Yes, I mean... You can be Sita and I can be Rama. A couple like them. And there's also Hanuman. Hanuman in the real world... If you are comparing them, Doni can be Hanuman. Then Doni is an ape? I didn't say that. Leave me out of this. You said it. Praise be to Allah. I'm the most grateful one. I get to witness Yowis Ben's success. I used to drive a trishaw. Now I drive a bus. A tour bus! Yes, I'm the same. If I hadn't met those boys, I'd still be a school security guard sitting around like a bird contest judge. I used to sell perfume. - And now? - And now? I still sell perfume. Although this is the first time Jon has invited me to come, I can see the aura of success around those kids. That's why the effort will never betray the result. I never thought those kids had such talent. At school, sometimes they forget to flush after they pee. - My, my. - Is that true? It's thanks to me, who always stood by them. You stood by while they peed? No! While they achieved this success. Me. "Monecot." Awesome. - What is it? - My phone. My wife's calling. My loved one. Mr. Ustad, your perfume works like a charm. My wife always misses me. She keeps calling me. Praise be to Allah. All right then. I need to go. I have to buy some perfume ingredients. - Where? - In Semarang. So far. All right. May peace be upon you. - Take care, Mr. Ustad. - And upon you as well. - Answer your phone. - Oh, right. Hello, dear. Yes, I'm hanging out with these useless boys. - Jon, want to buy perfume? - No. Uncle Jon, the usual. Bothering me. So how is it? Bay... Yes? What? Gosh. All right. I'm returning to the hotel, yes. - Bay, what happened? - Uncle! How did it become like this? Uncle, we've worked together for a year! And you're still like this! I'm sorry, Bay, guys. Sorry? Miss Short Hair. Can't we discuss this? We can't, Uncle. You booked the wrong date. Miss Receptionist, I'm asking for a favor. This lady booked the rooms first. Miss, I'm asking you a favor, for real. All right, miss? Just for one night. Let the guys sleep in their rooms. Miss. Take a look. Don't you feel sorry for him? And their baby keeps crying. How could you let him sleep on a bus? Miss, please help. Just for one night. My group is about to arrive. So I can't. Just for one night, miss! What are you doing, begging like that? Come on, guys! Take care, guys. Bay, guys, I can still try! You said you were the "Monecot"! Be patient, Uncle. Calm down. It's all right, we can sleep on the bus. What's important is that we're together. Together, my ass! I still have to drive! Calm down, jerk! Hey, noisy! Come down here if you dare! Guys, now what? This pilgrimage entourage, so impatient! Sheila on 7? Guys, it's Sheila on 7! - Really? - Come out and see! Sheila on 7. - Right? - You're right. -Sheila on 7 -You're right. - We have to take a picture. - For sure. Hello, guys. Look at the bus! So huge. I bet it has boarding rooms inside. I think they're coming from the concert in Manahan. Oh, right. Sheila on 7 is on a pilgrimage? Band. So they're the ones who took our hotel rooms! If I were you, I'd brawl with them. Done. It's not their fault. It's my fault. Sleeping on the bus again! - That was good. You have to be strict. - Okay. - Dem. - Ms. Rini. How are things? All good? All good, our band members are in their rooms. What happened back there? There was this band from Malang. The manager booked the wrong date. - From Malang? - That's right. Malang? Which band? That's their poster. You haven't changed it? Please don't forget, miss. - The poster, miss. - Sorry, I forgot. I'll change it now. YOWIS BEN ALL-AROUND JAVA TOUR - Where's Yowis Ben now? - I heard they're returning to Malang. What? Ms. Jum, you said your son was in a successful band. But you're still selling pecel. Ma'am, it's more important to be a blessing for others. "Blessing"? Sounds like a cracker brand. As long as the crackers don't go limp. Unlike Bayu, always limp. Oops, time to pay the rent! Thanks, ma'am. May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. - Ma'am. - Ms. Jum. It's about the house. Sir, let's stop. I can't hold it anymore. Don't be weird. This is a forest, there are lots of wild animals. We should get a bus with a toilet inside. A huge one, like Sheila on 7's bus. Uncle, let's stop! Singo needs to poop! - All right, Yan. - What do you mean, "All right"? You'd stop the bus for Singo but not for me? That baby is the king of the jungle. True, he poops a lot. If he poops here, he'll fill the whole bus. Fine, me too. I really need to go. It's so dark. - Hurry! - Wait! Excuse us, O forest dwellers. - Come on, I can't hold it. - Wait. Want to do it here? Let me spit on it. No way. I go now. A cowardly bodyguard? Shut up, I'll tear up your vehicle registration certificate! Fine, I'll go with you. Gosh, I can't find a good spot. - Excuse us, O forest dwellers. - Yes, excuse us. Here. Sir, give me the water. Don't stand too far. So big, Don. It hasn't even come out yet. I mean the tree. Damn, what did you eat, Don? Shut up, it hasn't come out! - Your fart came out! - Just a little. Don't stand too far. You said you'd stand by me. Dono, don't stand too far. - You said you were our friend. - Okay. Come sit. Sit next to me, as a friend. - What are you looking at, Nando? - Nothing, I'm pushing my rank. I see. - Where are you going? - To get some fresh air. YOWIS BEN ALL-AROUND JAVA TOUR Gosh, it's dark. Bayu. What are you doing? Get inside, Asih. It's dark. Aren't you scared? Of course not! I'm not scared of this. - Are you scared? - I am. - So you want to come with me? - Yes. All right, come here. Watch your step. It's dark. Come here. - I just want to see this road sign. - What? Oh, that way is Banyuwangi, Sih. Malang, Kediri. Malang is still 185km away. What's that? - That's your own ringtone! - Oh, my god. - It scared me. - Who's calling this late? - Oh, it's Mother. Just a moment, Sih. - Sure. - Yes, Mom? - May peace be upon you, son. And upon you as well. What is it, Mother? You surprised me, calling this late. Yes, son. I just finished my night prayers. Look, son. I just got some news. The owner of this house said she intends to sell it to someone else. Huh? But we paid the rent for a year, Mother. Well, it's already been a year, son. - Our choices are to buy this house... - Who is calling? or to move out. Gosh. How much if we have to buy it? Gosh, son. It's expensive. One hundred and twelve million rupiahs. She only gave us a week. If we don't buy it, she'll sell it to someone else. Dear Allah. I have my savings, but it's not enough. All right, Mother. Just relax. Calm down. Let me worry about it. All right then, son. - Take care on the road. - Yes. May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. Dear, what's with your mother? Nothing. Mother is doing just fine in Malang. Who's this? Yes? Yes, Yowis Ben. Yes, I'm the manager. Banyuwangi, 350km. Bay. What is it? You scared us. Now what? Somebody is asking us to perform in Banyuwangi. Do you want to? Let's take it, Uncle. - We'll take it? - Yes! - Fine, I'll accept the offer. - Yeah. But... dear. What about college? Well, about college... That can be arranged. He said it's in Banyuwangi. Banyuwangi is just straight from here. Nice. Malang is still far. Malang is that way. We need to take a longer route. But look. Banyuwangi is still 350... Well, that's if we take the main road. We'll take sideroads. Shortcuts. Just trust me. Come, just get inside the bus. This forest is huge. You'll meet a ghost or... Am I right? The smell is terrible. What? - I can't get closer, you stink, Doni. - Sir. What? Damn! What? Run! - Wait, I'm not done! - Just squeeze it back in! Sir! What's taking him so long? Maybe his poop is as big as a helmet. - What's that, Yan? - Sorry, excuse me. Okay, Yan. Yan, what did you throw away? Singo's waste. So stinky. Kamidi! Eh, guys? You said you're my friend! In times like this, I have no friends! What's wrong, sir? What is it? I was in the forest. I just saw a partition! An apparition! Don't say it, you'll invite her! Dono, why are you afraid? You're the security! But this is a supernatural matter. It's not my job! - Let me resign. - Don't! What's with you? Incompetent! Wait, where's Doni? - You're right. - Wasn't he behind you? Behind you, I ran first! Bay, I told him to squeeze it back in! Then he didn't do it. There, stop blaming each other. Supernatural matters, let me handle them. Thank you, dear God, we have a solution. I don't need to resign. Show us the way, let's look for Doni. - Go back? - Come on, hurry. You with the flashlight, upfront. - You walk up front! - Hurry. We go together. - Come with us, Uncle. - Me too? Bayu! Asih, I'm not afraid of this stuff. It'll be quick. I know you're not scared, but you're jumpy. It'll be quick. Nando, please take care of them. Guys, don't leave me! Don? - This is where Doni pooped, right? - Yes. Where is he now? I don't know. Let's just follow the smell. Where's the ghost? Bay, don't say that, you'll invite her! So calling her will invite her? Bay! What's that? You invited her, Bay. - What's that? - It's your responsibility, Bay! - You invited her! - What's that, Di? - I already told you. - Yan, start praying. - What, Bay? - Uncle, come with me! What is that? - Come on, Uncle! - You're the one who invited her! - Leave me out of this! - Come on, slowly. - Yan, come. - Okay. Okay. Bayu. I'm staying here. - I'll open this. - Don't, Bay! One, two... Run! - It's Doni. - Who? - It's Doni. - Guys! What are you doing, Don? I'm trying to clean myself but I have no water, Bay! What's that? - White figure, Bay! - Now what? - White! - What? - Pray, Yan! - You invited her, Bay! Yan, pray! - It's not working, Yan! - Bay. This is my ultimate prayer! Feel his ultimate prayer! Yan, she's getting closer! It's not working! - Bayu! - Run! - Bayu! - Why did it happen? Guys! Guys, where are you? Damnit! - Get in! - Sir, behind you. - What is it? - What happened? Get in first! Uncle Jon, don't leave us! I go first! Put him down! - Me first! You're the driver! - Uncle Jon, me first! - Help me! - Why are you sitting here? Get in! Close the door! - Hurry! - Move it! Uncle, get in! What is this smell? - Yeah, what is this smell? - Sorry, Sih. I haven't cleaned myself. - Calm down! - What's wrong? Get down. Just wait. She's moving around. She goes somewhere else. - Don, go check. - Why me? Go on, check! - Come with me. - Get down. - It's gone! - Stand up. It's clear, she's gone. Yeah, for real! Let's look together. Uncle, Mr. Dono passed out! - He's the security, but passed out? - Uncle! Not so loud. Calm down. - Singo, my baby! - Hurry, Mia! Let's get out of here! - Jon, come on! - Sir, let's move! Stop it, hey! Hey, lunatic! Out in the woods scaring people! Come on, I'll take you home. That's why you shouldn't have run for the village chief. Now you're insane. Come on. Go on, keep going. Keep going. - Dear. - What? I was afraid. Relax, Asih, you have me. Let's go back. - Hurry. - Yes, sorry. What's wrong? Hey, already cleaned yourself? - I did. - Get rid of your underwear! Yeah, I'm not gonna keep it, Bay. All right, friends, let's gather up. Uncle Jon just received a phone call. We're asked to perform in Banyuwangi. Right, Uncle? - Praise be to Allah. - Praise be to Allah. We'll perform acoustic songs. - And the hotel's already booked, right? - Right. All right, Bay. I need money to send to my dad. - I'm ready now. - Praise be to Allah. Singo brought a lot of fortune. - Let's go, husband. - Okay, Mia. All right, ready to go to Banyuwangi? - Ready! - Sorry, guys. I can't. - What's wrong, Nando? - I miss... Missing who? Stevia is coming with us. Well, I miss home, Dad, Aunt Jeje. You are awesome, Nando. You're handsome, you care for your parents. But to be more perfect, you have to care for your friends, Nando. Look at Yayan. He needs money for Singo's milk and diapers. Look at Doni's face. His parents appreciate him now. His performance on stage made them proud. And Mr. Dono, Mr. Kamidi. They still have to pay off their debts. Think about them, Nando. I'll let you decide, Nando. - If you miss them, you can call them. - True. BLAMBANGAN PARK Bayu, what island is that? That's Bali Island, Sih. So near. Banyuwangi is also called "The Sunrise of Java." You can see the first sunrise in Java is here at Banyuwangi. So pretty. - Hello, Uncle? - Yes, Bay. - How are things? - Yes, I'm at the stage. Uncle, I'm asking you to be more focused this time, all right? Yes. Okay. - Wow, this looks fun. - Join us, Bay! What? Were you the one who called last night? - We've met in Solo, right? - Yes. Sorry about what happened in Solo. It's all right, don't worry about it. Is this your event? Yes, the performers couldn't come. So I asked you guys. No wonder. Beautiful people always have kind hearts. - Going for a swim? - Yes, Mia. - Take care of your kid. - Yes, Mia. You're not legally married! It's the "husband." You guys are a couple. Cute frog. - That's a cactus. - Really? Don't splash me, I'm holding my phone. - So white. - Green! Hey, come on. Like Titanic. Don't do that. I will get drowned. - Come on! - No way. - Oh, you're staring at Asih's legs? - What are you saying? - I'll tell Bayu! - No, I'm... Don, don't pee there. Bad habit. Take care of your kid! Don't! Excuse me. I'll check it first. Check, one. Check, one, two. - Jon. - One. Check. - Jon. - What? Check... Rini? Thank you, Dem. I'm not dreaming, am I? You've become... Become what? Your hair has become wavier. Too much. What is this thing? Rini. Rini. What do you say if after the performance we walk around the beach? Watch some crabs? Like this. Or jellyfish? The cure for my heart I went through The mountains and the oceans For a long time I've been searching I've been waiting Days and nights For some peace in my heart You and I must become one... - Rin. - Yes? I didn't know that Yowis Ben was invited by your event organizer. Oh, this is the event organizer I started two years ago. You're amazing, Rin. Demila has been helping me. For some peace in my heart You and I must become one... What is this show, Mr. Edi? Why did you invite an unknown band like this? Never mind that, as long as my daughter's happy. - Shadow puppet shows are better. - Inviting an unknown band like this. All feelings become one If I'm wrong, please forgive me But the love in my heart is for real Days and nights... - Mia, let's go there. - Hey. The hotel's nice, and the AC is cold. Let's stay here. Jon, I'm sorry. That night. I didn't know that the band checking out in Solo was the band that you manage. Yes, Rin, Bayu is successful now with his band. It's been two years. You're amazing. But, Rin, I think... It is time. For me to stop taking care of Bayu. You and I must become one I feel love Inside my heart... Surprise. Sir, why are you here? You're disturbing. Is the event successful? If you want this to be successful, just guard upfront. Jon, I'd like you to meet... Captain Arjuna. - Sujono. - Rini's fiancé. I've been waiting For some peace in my heart... - Success? All good? - All good. I really like your hair today. Really? Thanks. Dear, let's talk over there. - Okay, excuse me. - Jon. - Watch your step. - Yes. Guys, prepare the car. Our boss is going for lunch. For a long time I've been searching - I've been waiting... - Uncle Jon. - Days and nights... - Uncle Jon, please monitor. For some peace in my heart... - Uncle Jon! - Jon, please monitor. Uncle Jon! What's wrong? If I'm wrong, please forgive me - But the love in my heart is for real... - Uncle Jon, the sound is off! What is this? What is this? He's suck! Uncle Jon, please monitor! Uncle, what happened back then? I was shocked. - Why were you shocked? - That thing. Uncle, why do you keep doing this? Whatever! - Whatever! - Bay. Let's just go back to Malang! Bay... - Whatever! - Bay. What's wrong, Bay? We only got paid half! Let's go back to Malang. Gosh. Kamidi, please monitor. - Let's go back to Malang. - Hey! I'm right here. Still here? Mia, Uncle Jon... - The boys are upset at him. - Huh, why? Because of Ms. Rini. - Goodness... - Just a minute. Why are you surprised, Mia? Who's Ms. Rini? Tell her everything, Stev. Ms. Rini is Uncle Jon's ex. They were about to get married but they canceled it. If so, then what will happen to us? I think we're going back to Malang. By the way... Why is there no water here? Singo still can't swim. What's with you, Uncle? Meeting Ms. Rini should make you happy. She's your ex. Nice hotel. Great swimming pool. Soft bed, it's your reunion. Reunion, my ass! What's with your ass? Her fiancé came! What? The solution... We turn back, let me face him. Be my guest if you dare. Uncle, I dare, I have lots of guts. Don't look down on small people. Just sit tight. Watch McGregor fight, all right? I'll turn this bus around. Go on if you want to fight a military officer. Uncle. Not all problems... can be solved with violence. Especially with a military officer. We can talk about this nicely, Uncle. He takes care of our nation, as well as Ms. Rini. Hey! Uncle, do we go straight or left to a dead end? Whatever! Reunion, my ass! Guts, fight! MALANG CITY HALL Mom, I'm home. Please open the gate, Mom. Mom? Dad? Mom? I'm sorry, Don. Your mother and I haven't told you. Don't be surprised. What? I said don't be surprised. Your mom, brother, and I have to return for a while to Blitar. I'm having trouble with my business. I have a lot of debts. Every day, debt collectors were chasing me. Goodness. If only Uncle Jon could be more focused just a little, Mother. Gosh, the performance would've been a success. With the payment and my savings, we could've bought this house. The performance was a mess, the organizers were upset. Just let it go, son. Don't blame your uncle. But it was his fault, Mother. But all this time, your uncle has been understanding you. Now it's time for you to understand him. Then what about the house, Mother? We'll find a way, son. Oh, right, son. About the house, don't tell your uncle. I think... He has a lot on his mind. - Jum. - Yes. I bet you're making pecel, I can tell. Of course, Jon. What else? Bay. You're running. Let's go inside and get you a drink. When you grow up, you'll be a soldier. This green one, it's fresh. This blue one is soothing and calming. - You will be a soldier. - Don't try them all. - I'm buying. - My profit is by millimeter. - Ustad Jarno. - Yes? Thank goodness you're here. Pray for Singo, he will become a soldier. Amen, he'll be like his grandfather. - Singo will be a soldier! - Amen. No! - Singo will become a musician. - A soldier. - A musician. - A soldier! Sir. - What? - Excuse me. - This quarrel confuses me. - Why are you confused? - A lion wants to be a soldier? - A musician. What is this, a circus? Singo is my grandson, he'll be a soldier. - Musician. - Gosh. So your grandson is in a circus? Sir, what are you talking about? Singo is the name of Mr. Khairul's grandson. I got it. Husband! I'm pregnant again! Praise be to Allah. Singo will have a sibling. His sibling will become a soldier. - Musician! - Soldier! Darn this kid! What is this, Nando? I told you, you can't go to school abroad. But that has been my dream for a long time, Dad. Can't you be like my friends' dads, who support and listen to their kids? Facilitate what they need. What haven't I done for you? I've been supporting you in your band. After you graduate college, you must carry on my business. But I don't want to take care of your store, Dad! I want to go abroad and study music! Calm down, honey. Your son just got home and you're fighting with him already. Can't you two wait until we finish breakfast? Whatever! You never understand me. Nando! Fernando! Father. Excuse me. Thank you for letting me sleep here last night. Who let you? I'm sorry, Father. I... It's all right. In God's house, everyone is welcome. Why didn't you knock? I could've lent you a blanket and a pillow. Why did you sleep here? That's because... My house was confiscated, Father. And my family moved back to Blitar. Would you like to stay here and help me take care of the church? Yes, Father. Thank you so much. Don't thank me. So this is our church's storeroom. That's the sofa. You can sleep there. - But you have to clean up after yourself. - Yes. - Thank you, Father. - Yes. Bay. I want to tell you something. Tell me what? So right now... The truth is, I have a problem. Me too. I have a problem. What problem, Bay? Our house. Last year was about the rent. Now, suddenly, the owner wants to sell it. How troublesome, right? How can we buy it? It's expensive. Yeah. - Just be patient, Bay. - Yeah. - That's your problem. Now, my problem... - Right. So right now... - Sorry I'm late. - Oh, it's all right, Yan. Yeah. What's wrong? Living with your in-law, everything is fixed. - I'm upset. - Calm down, Yan. Life is hard. I feel it too. I'm... Sorry, I have a headache. My dad is still the same with his old-fashioned way of thinking! Can't grow. That's how parents are, Nando. You should hold back, calm down. We all have problems. We have to face them. - Just like me... - That's right. - We all have our own problems. - That's right. Why don't we start our practice? "Konco Sing Apik," okay? - "Konco Sing Apik," huh? - Okay? Let's. One, two, three, four. Good friends Guys. I'm sorry. But you don't have any practice schedule today. But we booked the studio as usual. No info from Uncle Jon. See? Today's fully booked by another band. They're here already. What should we do now? Pack up your stuff. Sorry. Milk egg honey ginger drinks, to cure your broken hearts. - Come drink, don't be shy. - Okay. - Thank you, Uncle. - Yes, Uncle. - Tastes good. - So delicious. Sorry, guys. I just finished my afternoon prayers. It's all right. Bay, you're not praying? It's all right, I'll stop by Jami Mosque. Always delaying. Fine, I won't do it again. But true, praying is not something you should delay. Do you guys know? What else we shouldn't delay? - What? - Taking this chance. To become bigger, more professional, more popular. - What do you say? - I agree. If Yowis Ben can be bigger, more professional, we can get more money. We can rent a bus like Sheila on 7, nice. True, to guarantee Singo and his sibling's future. - What? - What? - Singo's having a sibling? - Singo's having a sibling? Yes, praise be to Allah. What will you name the kid? Munyuk? Hey! You and your harsh mouth. I was just asking. What then? Panda. - Panda bear? - Panda bear? Just a moment, Yan. We've been having concerts, busy. When did you do it? After performing, all I can do is sleep at the hotel. What else would you do with Bayu if you didn't sleep? -True -Play Carrom? We did it that night when our bus passed Pandaan. So that's why we encountered a ghost. - Yan, don't do it too often. - It's all right. Yayan's a legal husband. Yeah, it's all right, Bay. No wonder when we passed Pandaan, the bus' shock breakers were bouncing, Yan. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Yan, congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations, Yan. - Thank you. - A direct hit? - Yes, a direct hit. Back to our business. Our band, Yowis Ben has to be bigger. More popular. We need a manager who can focus. Bay, I disagree if the solution is leaving Uncle Jon again. - No way. - It's not like that. - So? - Let's think. About how we can make Uncle Jon be more focused. - Yes, how? - How about we let Uncle Jon meet Ms. Rini? That'll make him more focused. Ms. Rini is in Surabaya. Let's go see her. What do you say? - We go to Surabaya? - Yes. - I'm coming! - You'll come? - I will. - Surabaya, count me in. - In the name of Allah. - Okay. - Let's toast. - Come on. - A toast, Yan. - Wait, he hasn't ordered. - Huh? Yan? - A toast. Uncle Sindu, one glass, please. Like this one, for strength. - Don't, Uncle. - Yes, don't. He'll have another kid. It'll be a mess. - One coffee then. - No! He'll wake up all night and make another baby. Don't. Fine. Gos is the greatest. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God. Susan? Bayu? Why are you here? Bay, how are you? I see you've become successful. I'm so proud. Praise be to Allah, San. No matter what, my first inspiration was... you. I see you look more beautiful wearing a hijab. Praise be to Allah if you think that way. Thank you. By the way, have you returned from "Next to Kauman," Germany? So here's the story, Bay. I wanted... Hold on. Just a minute. Who's this? Um, San. My mother is asking me to help her buy some pecel ingredients. So I have to go. - I'm so sorry. - That's all right, I understand. But, Bay... Is your number still the same? Oh, my number's still the same. All right, I'll go on ahead. - May peace be upon you. - And upon you as well. Yes, hello? Are you picking me up at the campus? Yeah, I'm heading there straight. All right, take care. STATE UNIVERSITY OF MALANG Asih! - Bayu. - Yes? Where are we going? Should we go to my boarding house? What? To your boarding house? - Yes. - Don't, Sih. Why? That's indecent. Hold on. Here is your order. We're here Dear, it's hard to take off. It's stuck. It is hard, wait. Ah, there you go. - Okay, come on. - Okay. - Hi, guys. - Hi, Stev. MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING Why are you having a date here? People go on a date to Songgoriti. Payung. Stev. Here, I can put it in my tab. What will you order, Sih? I'll order... I'll have a glass of warm water. - What? - Here's the menu. No, let's order iced milk coffee. - No, it's all right. - Okay. What about you? Let me see. Warm water, just like hers. Yes, sir. Gosh, you take your pretty girlfriend out just to drink water? Bro, not just water. Warm water. Besides, it's all right. I feel like it. Also, I'm on a diet. So I'm cutting down on sugar. Right, Dear? Oh, right. - Are you cutting down on sugar too? - Yes, Bro. My father died from diabetes. Is that so? Miss, one glass of warm water, please. Keep going like this, Bay, and you're putting me out of business! Consider it charity. - Asih. - Yes? I'm asking permission to leave. I'm going to Surabaya with the boys tomorrow. Wait. Don't you have classes tomorrow? I just copied the materials that you've missed. You have graphic design, animation. And last week, when you wore a blue shirt, didn't you skip class? And a friend of yours told me. The previous week, you were sleeping in class. You sat in the right corner at the back. - And after that... - Asih. This concerns Uncle Jon. You know lately, Uncle Jon has been losing focus. You mean about Ms. Rini? Huh? How did you know? Stevia and Mia told me everything. - Everything? - Yes. - Even the details? - Yes. - Here. - Oh, right. - Grab them yourselves. - Yes. - No, this one's yours, this one's hers. - Okay then. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - So you knew? - Yeah. This women's society really likes to gossip. - Of course, it's fun. - Yeah. And also... Actually, I'm having trouble at home. I bet your mother's mad at you for skipping classes, right? You can't keep doing this. You can't neglect your studies. I'm trying to catch up on all the materials that I missed since I went on tour with you. I want to graduate together with you. Go to the ceremony with you. I know, Sih, but... My problem is not that, but... Who is it? MAY PEACE BE UPON YOU, BAYU... Who is it? No, it's the guys. When we go out together like this they like to tease us. How come their notification sounds different? Usually, it sounds like... Like that. Why is it different? It's, uh... The update. The software gets an update every week, see? Sometimes the settings get reset. - Really? - Yeah. Come drink your warm water. It will get cold. Stev, thank you. The water here tastes great. If you boil it, the temperature is just fine. Let's toast. Drink it. Update? Your phone got updated? Bay. This is not like what the brochure said. Mr. Kamidi. Excuse me. What's wrong, Bay? You said 400,000 to Surabaya. Comfortable ride with musicians, live music. Why are we with these ladies? Live music? Ladies! Music until we reach Surabaya! White agati, white agati Planted in the grand garden There's sparkle falling You wonder what flower it is White agati, white agati Planted in the grand garden There's sparkle... SUNAN AMPEL PILGRIMAGE TOUR Nando got so excited to go to Surabaya, and he left us on his own. Never mind, Don. He's visiting his sick relative. Yan, is this the right alley? I hope so. It's been three years, things have changed a little. - Peneleh Street 1 is that way... - There it is, Pitikih. Oh, right. - Shall we go inside? - Yeah. Damn. I think that officer is Ms. Rini's boyfriend. - What a strapping man. - Gosh. Can Uncle Jon compete with someone like this? Forward! Forward! Eyes to the front! Roll over! March! Return! You have good intentions, guarding our nation! But you have no talent! Don't imagine it, Yan. That won't fit. - Sir. - Yes, ma'am. Let's wait inside. I'll keep you company. It's fine. - But he is so manly, Don. - That's why he suits Ms. Rini. Can Uncle Jon do that? - No? - It's hard. Wrong way, Yan. Even worse way, Yan! Well, it's hopeless. It's easier for us to keep Uncle Jon happy. Yeah, some dough balls will make him smile. Yeah. - Let's return to Malang? - Let's go. All right. Guys! Huh? Miss? Why are you here? - It's, uh... - What is it, Yan? - What is it, Yan? - What? Come stop by for a while. I'll serve you something warm. - These guys keep asking to go home. - Come inside. - Yes, something warm. - Sir, please. What's the hurry? Something warm. Miss. Busy with work, ladies? Am I bothering you? Bay, the atmosphere here is warm. I apologize. - Don! - Something warm, right? Where do you kids come from? We're from Malang, ma'am. - Oh, from Malang? - That's right. We're a band, ma'am. You're in a band, but none of you are handsome? You're the most handsome one here, sir. So why are you looking for Rini? That, uh... What was it? - What was it, Don? - Huh? It's like this, Mr. Military. My friend Yayan will represent me. Come on. Mr. Military. What are the requirements to join the military? Why join the military, Yan? Singo's grandfather wants him to be a soldier. A lion becomes a soldier? No, ma'am. Singo is the name of my friend's baby. A male can have a baby? So what exactly is your purpose? - You haven't answered. - That... - What's our purpose, Yan? - What? - What's your purpose, sir? - Huh? I'm a client, sir. Huh? You said you're a band, why's he a client? Yes, we're a band. I'm the bassist. - I'm the guitarist. - I'm the drummer. - I'm a client. - Why are you a client? What do you play in this band? I'm a client, ma'am. A client. What's your instrument? Cables or something? I don't play anything. I'm a client, ma'am! - You said you're a band! - But I'm a client, ma'am! You dare lie to me? I hear you, don't shout! Yelling at the elderly! How mannerless! - I see we have guests. - Speak more clearly. Excuse me. Yowis Ben members. Bayu, Doni. - Miss. - Yayan. Nando? What do you mean "Nando"? I'm a client, miss! I have a job, I brought money! For you, for Pitikih! A job? Why didn't you say so earlier? Should've said that from the start. Come, let me serve you some refreshments. - Let's. - This is nice. Why are you standing? To have something warm? I don't know you kids. This man is real. He brought money, let's go. A feast for you! Why didn't you say so? You have a job for us, come inside. Dear Juna. Why are you still here? You said you were heading for your base. Right. I was entertaining your guests. - Thank you. - Yes, you're welcome. I need to go now. - Miss. - Boys. - You came all the way from Malang? - Yeah. Let me serve them something warm. Oh, right. Sweet or not? Everybody's sweet here, miss. - Three sweet ones. - Okay. - Thanks, Dem. - Coming right up. I'm sorry, I thought you replaced Nando. No, miss. Yowis Ben is the four of us. We can't replace Nando. Kind of looks like him. Older version of Nando. This is my office. Right in front of my house. Miss, I need your fingerprint here. What's this? Done. - Thank you. - You're welcome. How nice. This event organizer, right? Including that miss, so nice and friendly. All my employees are females. They're all pretty, miss. And hard workers. Please sit down. Thank you, miss. Here's something warm. - Here you go. - Thank you, miss. Thank you, miss. So this is what she means with something warm. What did you expect? You know, coffee. - Can't be exhaust pipes. - Please have this. Bay, how's Ms. Jum? Oh, Mother is thankfully fine. She's still selling pecel in Malang. I'm glad everyone's fine. What exactly are you here for? Here's the story, miss. We came to Surabaya, first, to apologize for what happened in Banyuwangi. Our performance was a mess. Well, that's how you run an event business. You will face risks. Never mind, don't worry about it. And? And we also... have this idea. Is it possible for Yowis Ben to be managed by your event organizer? Like that. Well... It's possible. Their songs are nice. Yowis Ben has potential. If your event organizer can handle us, - we'll get more money. - Yes. - More income. - Yes. I can help my mother a little. I too have to support my family, miss. That's nice. True, miss. Singo needs his milk. Lion? Drinking milk? Dear Allah, how many times do I have to explain this? It's like this, miss. Yayan's son is called Singo. Gosh. Yayan has a kid? Yes, miss. He's about to have two, miss. Right now his wife is pregnant. Singo's sibling will be named Panda. Why Panda? Because the baby was conceived in... Pandaan. We have this tour bus. And at the back... Don! Nando, how's your relative? Good? Good, I visited them. They're all healthy. - Thank goodness. - Yes. Hey, how's Ms. Rini? What did she say? She got us a gig in Kediri. Should we take it? What about that song "Turi Putih," Yan? White agati, white agati Planted in the grand garden Come on, Don. Planted in the grand garden Stop! Why's the bus moving? Where are we? - Pandaan. - Pandaan? Huh? What about "Turi Putih"? Where are the ladies? We thought they're all going to Surabaya. Don. The ladies live in Sukun, Malang, Don! So we left them? You didn't say anything. I was sleeping. You should've woke me up, Don! We already paid 400,000 and we have to wake you up too? My ass! Just for 400,000 I might end up in the Emergency Room, Don! You know, their husbands are martial artists, Don! Forty husbands are waiting for me, Don! Gosh, in Malang, they will beat you up. Why do you have to clarify that? A bump here, a bruise here. - Scary. - What should I do? Driver, turn back. White agati... Be quiet, please! Driver, turn back! - The husbands are calling, Don! - Answer it! Hello, sir. We left "Turi Putih" behind. What should I say? - Do it like this. - Like this? I'll take responsibility, sir. Rice price at Malang Grand Market is lowered. Shallot price at Oro-Oro Dowo Market is lowered. Jon, what haven't I done for you? You took a year off, now you come back asking for another show, I allowed it. Why are you so unenthusiastic? Prices are lowered, Jon. That's good news, don't be sad. I'm sorry, Yance. What is it? Come here and tell me. Here's the story. The other day, I met... my ex. - Pregnant? - No. - She's more beautiful now? - Yes. - Want to get back with her? - Ye... Yes. Well, just ask her. That's the problem, I can't. Why not? She has a fiancé. Goodness, Jon. No wonder you sound like this. What's with you? This, sir. Just like my love story. Fellow listeners. Who among you has the solution for Uncle Jon's love story? You're a security guard but have a heart like Hello Kitty. Bowo, what's your solution? Uncle, I know a paranormal expert. Just give a pelet to your ex. You're making things up. You think I'm a catfish? - For your ex, Jon. - My ex is not a catfish. Tilapia fish! - Should we order food or drinks first? - Food. Sir, can we get a picture? Yes, miss. Of course. Di, please take our picture. - Dono? - Huh? - The picture... - Shut up. Huh? Cool, Di. Sir, I mean a picture with Yowis Ben! I'd be embarrassed if I were you. - A picture with me is just as fine. - No, thanks. Do you want my WhatsApp number, miss? - Enough. - Sit down. I have an important announcement. We got another gig. In Kediri. I can pay my installments. Husband, will you get paid a lot? - By Allah's will, Mia. - When's the concert, Bay? Sunday. All right, good then. - All good. - All good. - Dear, we need to talk later. - What do you want to talk about? Guys, I too have an announcement. - Is it important? - Well, not really. So it's like this. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry, Bay. I can't come. - What? - But this is important! Yes, Bay. I'm afraid I'll make more mistakes. What? Look... Enough, that's it. I'm afraid I'll change my mind. I need to do my radio show. - Uncle Jon. - Uncle, don't be like that. Dear, let's talk first. Talk about what? I'm concerned about Uncle Jon. But we need to talk. Asih, what do you want to talk about? Do you love me? What? Of course. From 0 to 100, how much? A million. Times a million, full. Then if you love me, why don't you go to college? You asked my permission to go to Surabaya. Now this, a concert in Kediri. It's like this, Sih. This is the result of our trip to Surabaya the other day. A concert in Kediri. Our intention is to get Uncle Jon closer to Ms. Rini. Tell you what, you better not come with us to Kediri. You can focus on your studies. I promise. After Kediri I will catch up with all the studies that I missed. - Really? - Really. Do you love me? I do. From 0 to 100? A billion. For goodness sake! - Come on, Bay. Go after Uncle Jon. - Yes. From 1 to 100, Bay? Let's go. All right! Listeners, we have a letter from Sulastri in Kauman. Her message for Uncle Jon, "Be patient, Uncle. My kids and I are waiting for you." "Ahmad, Wawan, Mawar, Dewi, Joni." Gosh, Sulastri. Do you have an orphanage or an agency? We have Selvy in Sawojajar. Listeners, we have Uncle Jon in the studio. Jon, your love story went viral. Is that so? Look, people sent you food. Flowers, letters, there's so many! - Jon, would you like to become more viral? - What do you mean? - Just a second, Lo. - What? We've been eating pecel rice here for three years. What do we get? This is a competition, see who's stronger. - What do you mean? - If you're not strong, you can leave. The strong one gets Ms. Jum. Then I'm the strong one. You were complaining. That was before. Now, I'm strong enough to get Ms. Jum. - I'm stronger. - I'm stronger. Ms. Jum, why is Uncle Jon on the radio? He has a radio show. - Why is he climbing the roof? - What? All right, Uncle Jon is on the roof of Elfara Radio. That's what happens when you're heartbroken. Especially when your most beautiful ex is marrying someone else. Crushed to the deepest. Your heart, gall, pancreas, kidneys, everything hurts. - I think he's stealing mangoes. - Picking up kites! Fellow listeners. You all now have the chance to give suggestions. Or choose the ending of Uncle Jon's love story. A happy ending or a tragic one. Just send a message to us. - Ms. Jum. - To Elfara Radio. What's with Jon? Yeah, acting like a madman. Bayu said the other day, Jon met Rini. But Rini already has a fiancé. I'd say goodbye immediately. Quickly, call the radio. I don't have a cellphone, how can I call? - What are you calling for, sir? - So that he won't jump, he'll get hurt. - Then what? - Getting hit by a train is a better way. Shut it! Watch your mouth! - Uncle Jon. - What? Our listeners demand a tragic ending. Is that so? Jump! Uncle Jon, be brave! Jump! Face first! Goodness, Jon. Dear God. Let's... Uncle, what are you doing up there? - Fixing the roof? - Watch your mouth. Come on, what's your request? Happy or tragic ending? For Uncle Jon's love story. If it's tragic, he jumps? - Of course. - You're insane. No! - Uncle, get down! - Don't be reckless! We can talk about this, Uncle. What's your request for Uncle Jon's ending? Uncle, we talked about this. We won't leave you like that time. We agreed to trust you, right? You can be more focused. Come with us to Kediri, Uncle. Thank you, guys. For still trusting me. What's with you kids? We're live on air, the rating is good! - Uncle Jon, come on jump! - No, Uncle! He's still my uncle! He's old, let him be. Just jump, Jon! - Uncle, don't! - Get down! - Get down! - Get down, Uncle! Jon! What, Jum? What the heck is wrong with you? Attempting suicide? As if you don't have a religion! It wasn't like that, Jum. We were just pretending. To increase our show's rating. Look, I get a lot of presents. My fans sent these. Pretending to give me a heart attack? What are you... Hallowed be thy name Hi, Don. Father. - Enjoying your meal? - Yes. - Good? - Good. Of course, it's free. Thank you, Father. Well, do you enjoy staying here? - I do. - Thank goodness. - Try to feel at home. - All right. Go ahead and have a rest. No, Father. I'd like to do my prayers first. Nice. But take a bath first. It's not nice to face the Lord with a dirty body. - Yes, Father. - Bless you. Bless you. Son, have some fries. All right. Where are you going, Son? I have a gig in Kediri, Mother. Then what about your college? Come sit first. So here's the thing, Mother. This concert in Kediri has a lot of missions behind it. To buy this house, and also to... Make Uncle Jon happy. Is that so? All right, if you have good intentions may God show you the way, son. Amen. Let me iron your underwear. Mother! I'm a big boy, why do you have to iron my underwear? Embarrassed? When you were a kid, I had to count for you to pee. One, two, three. Enough. I will iron them myself. Fine. I miss Dad. Mom. And my brother. Please give my family safety. Happiness, health. I also pray... for Yowis Ben... to become more successful. Kept away from problems. Doni, your humble servant... beg for You to grant me... abundant love in my life. Alisa. Oh, so you go to this church too? Yes. You never go to church. You only come when you have troubles. It's not like that. I always sit at the back, so I never see you. Why did you... come all the way to Solo for Yowis Ben? Well... I like the songs. Do you like the songs or the guitarist? The songs. The guitarist's songs, right? Thank you. While it's hot. - Sweet, right? - Yeah. Like you. I guess this much's enough, just for a day. Huh, it has a hole. Susan? BAY, YOU STILL HAVING YOUR CONCERT GIG IN KEDIRI? To Malang riding a carriage, but there's no cow to pull it. We pray that Yowis Ben's concert will be successful and fortunate. Sir, we're leaving. - We're leaving. - Okay. - We'll be leaving. - Sir.

Don't be like when you were a kid, all right? - Why, Uncle? - Draw letters. No, Uncle. That was when I was a kid. Yan, get it straight. You missed the target. Oh, right. Who is that guy, investigating us? I think he's an officer. Yes, but an officer of what? Uncle, ask him. You're the manager. Yes, Bay. Sir, excuse me. They're not sons of a kyai.

So today's event is from your event organizer? Thank you, Rin. Oh, right. I'd like to apologize. For the trouble in Banyuwangi. Because I was... Because you were what? I was shocked. I'm sorry if I shocked you. You wouldn't expect me to still wait for you after three years, would you? Yes, Rini. I understand. Is your boyfriend all right with this? It's fine with me. These three years, I've been looking after Bayu. That's nice, Jon. They've reached this kind of success. That's consistency. Right. Rini, let's eat. They say it's the best stew in Kediri. How can we tell its taste? Oh, right. It's tasty just by looking at it. Moreover, if you twist it like this. Everyone who eats here will return. - Really? - Yes. Because they miss... The taste. Sir, the spoons, please. CHICKEN STEW PODJOK Thank you, Rini. - Jon. - Yes. Wrong end. Oh. That's fine. Right. Jum, how is she? - She's all right. - Still selling pecel? My sister is like that. She only knows how to make pecel. Right. - What about your chickens? - Chickens? It has been three years. I only had four chickens. - Five died. - What? What's with you? Always joking. How did Bayu get to form a band? What's the story? Yes, that. Nowadays kids are creative. When I was a kid, I only thought about chickens and pigeons. - They make their own songs? - Yes, their own songs. Actually, it was their trick. They made songs to get girlfriends. Don't you want to write a song? I'm thinking of writing a dangdut song. But if I make one, it will have sad lyrics. Crushed. You're an excellent weaver. This performance tells the story of Bujang Ganong. And his battle against Pratolo Dragon. To take back Kediri Princess, Songgo Langit. Who won? Look. Bujang Ganong, of course. I want to be like Bujang Ganong. You'll have to fight the Pratolo Dragon. I can do that. - Really? - Yes. If the princess is beautiful like you. You'll have to eat glass shards. We have special guests tonight. Who are they? - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! We invited Yowis Ben to Kediri so we can all... Don, I think Uncle Jon is focused tonight. I think so too. Let's watch the performance by Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! - Yowis Ben! To have a calm life To have peace inside my heart To have meals on my table I don't need to struggle But that's just my imagination None of them is real I've worked hard day and night But I still gain nothing To make a living in this world We must go through hardships But we all still have to work hard Leave it to the Almighty Don't hurt other people Let's hope we can live a noble life To have a noble life It's what everybody in this world wants Don't use wicked ways And steal other people's right Don't complain too much Always remember the Almighty Let's pray for a noble life And some peace inside our heart... I don't know the machinery. Bro, what happened? Miss? - What happened? Bro? - Bro? - Why's the power down? - I don't know. Uncle Jon! - Just a second, Bay! - What's wrong? - Just a second, Bay! - Uncle! Why do you keep doing this? Goodness! Bay! Get in! Quick! Hurry! Please check what's wrong. Rin, look at this. - I've checked the cables! - I know, Jon. Why do I keep making a mess? - Why's my life like this, Rin? - Jon. What is this, Uncle? Why do you keep doing this? I feel bad for Ms. Rini, I'm embarrassed! Yowis Ben can never be big if you keep doing this! Incompetent! - Bay, I... - What? What more do you want to say? Listen, Uncle. If you weren't my uncle, I would've fired you! Goodness, Bay! Yes, I understand, Bay. Yowis Ben can't go big because of me. True! You can't stay focused! Enough, Bayu! Remember! This is your uncle. It's not proper for you to say that. This person has been with you since you were a kid. Up until now, he's been focused. Focused on Yowis Ben, on you! You have no idea what he has sacrificed. Be careful what you say. - Calm down, Jon. - Yes, Rin. So this is what you've been doing? I didn't come once to your event. How does it feel to cheat on me? Dear, what do you mean by that? This, you two are hugging in front of me. You still ask what I mean? I've been suspicious since this kid came to Surabaya. But you have to know the problem first. - I'm sorry, sir... - Shut up! Don't interfere! You're just Rini's bitter past. What, am I wrong? Am I right? This person is just your bitter past! You still deny it? - Rini! - Rin, wait! What? Listen well. If you ever approach my fiancée again, I'll guarantee, your every concert, wherever it is will be a mess. Do you understand, handsome boy? Your mustache is like a cricket. Uncle. Dear God, it wasn't Uncle Jon. Uncle. Uncle. Excuse me! Uncle Jon. - Bayu? - Susan. Are you upset about the concert? It was insane. I just don't get it. There, Bay. Don't worry about it. But I know who did it. And I also... Dear God, I made a mistake. Bay, calm down. Bay is with another woman. At a concert, you face many kinds of problems. Bayu! Asih? I didn't come to your concert once. Now you cheat on me? What? I'm not cheating on you! - You jerk! - Asih! Please wait, I can explain! - Asih, I can explain! - Drive, sir! Wait, sir! Please stop! Sir, please stop the car! Bay. - Bay, I need to talk about... - I'm really sorry, San. - I have to chase... - That girl? No, someone more important. I'm sorry, but I have to leave you here. Sorry. Uncle Jon! Uncle... - Pecel Boy! - Pecel Boy! Stop it, go home. Be patient, Bay. Have a big heart. Yes, Uncle. Uncle Jon, where are you? Uncle! I'm getting married! - ...15,000 rupiahs per kilogram... - Uncle! Shut up, I'm having a live broadcasting. Why did I treat my own uncle like that, Dear God?
