(MultiCom Jingle) - Fucking. That's what you were doing, right, Ralph? It's something about being aggressive. Knowing you're the one looking down at someone. Pinned underneath you, responding to your every thrust. It's comforting. It's not just a male thing you know, to want to be on top, to protect what's yours. Well, I learned that much watching my mother deal with my father while she was alive. A woman knows. Are you dressed yet? Cause you've got to get out of here. My father has business tomorrow, and I've got to make sure he's ready, and I don't want him seeing you leave. Yep. I learned a lot about making sure you're the one doing the fucking, and not the one being fucked. (clank) (boom) (dark music) - Uh, the Puerto Rican kid. Him, I could deal with. Him, you could trust. But the Columbian kid, what, what, what was his name? - Garcia. - Yeah, he's a snake. He's not to be trusted. Are you listening to me? - I am, Boss, but we've been over this already yesterday with Toni. - We did. - I can handle the Spaniards, trust me. Remember my cousin, Tommy Marone? - The garbage cop? - Right, you met him at the wedding. Yeah, anyway, he's a boss and in sanitation now, right? I got it, the state is using DEC and DEP to make a major sweep down here. - How come our friends down at PD haven't called? - Cause it's the Attorney General's office, they won't leak it to the PD until the last minute. - Yeah, they're just fucking with us with nickel and dime bullshit. - 150 thousand dollars in fines is not small potatoes, not to me anyway. Can I take this? - Yeah, go ahead. - Yeah? Sure. Hey, Fin. Fin answer me this. Why the fuck do I need you? You can't do a simple fucking thing I ask you? You fucking retard! Know where I am? That's right, don't fucking apologize, just handle it, now! I'm sorry. (suspenseful music) - Can't do that, I can't make heads or tails out of this shit. - Let the Jew handle it, that's what you pay him for. - Yeah, I know, I just, uh. You, do you know who died? That, uh, Bill Furente up in, a. - Yeah, Sing-Sing, he had the cancer. - Last week Anthony. We went to the funeral. You, me, Toni. Remember? - In Westbury? (Anthony laughs) - Yeah, right, right. Heart attack. I want you to move what you can move, and, uh collect what's owed. - Why don't you call Joey Apples and Pasqual? - No, no, no, no, now, you keep this among us. If the other family see a drop of blood in the water, they're coming for the kill. - You don't trust the capos? - I do not. Not now. This is very important business, huh? Capiche? - Capiche. - Capiche? - Oh, the gang's all here. - Whoah. - Jesus Christ. - What's up, babe? - Hey, another one, okay? - How you doing? How you doing? - Hey, Jim. You look great. I'm trying to lose a couple of pounds myself, I'm doing that Weight Watcher's like Gaetano. - It ain't fucking working. Anthony, sorry to come unannounced, but, uh, I was in the neighborhood. - It's fine, it's fine, Jimmy. Anytime. - Look at this guy, huh? You're getting back in the ring? - Nah, I don't know about that, I ain't got no wind anymore. Mickey the Mick. I ain't seen you around. - That's cause I don't hang out in subway johns trolling for fags. (laughter) And it's not Mick. It's Mickey. Or Mr. O'mara to you. - Easy, I'm just kidding. How's Toni? - Toni's uh, busy with this and that. - I just want to sell them. - What can we do for you today, uh, Jimmy C.? - Well, Anthony, people talk to Gaetano, he's been hearing some things. Things that just don't sit right with us. - What things? - Gaetano got some unsettling news. - Hm. - It seems your capos, Pasqual and Apples? They're doing you dirty. They're skimming your profits, and uh, we know for a fact that they took down, three trucks out of Kennedy last month. - Are you certain about this? - I wouldn't be here if I wasn't. - Come on, right under our noses? - Well, I, uh, I appreciate this information. - Well, Gaetano would expect the same courtesy if the shoe was on the other foot. - Ah, yes, of course, of course. - Alright, he also said he'd like to see you as soon as possible. - Hey, I'll clear my schedule, and, I just need to digest this news, ah, a few days. Thank you, Jimmy. - Alright Anthony. - Hey, come here. (click) (shot) - Ah! (shot) (shot) (shot) (shot) (multiple shots) (rapid shots) (dramatic music) - That fucker. (shot) (somber music) (shutter clicking) (click) (click) (clicking) - Carmine, just in time for coffee. - [Carmine] What, no cake? Just coffee? - Why don't somebody get this guy an expresso? Yeah, so what are you doing here? What is this, high school reunion time? - What, I have to have a reason to come visit my friends? You got the Dutchman back there, Richie. Richie's back there. Joey Gugott's over there. The man with the tattoos, the fucking Mummy, and uh, Jimmy C. Almost didn't recognize you without the fucking numbers under your chin. - You're a funny guy, Cavelli. - Yeah, I'm a regular fucking Bob Hope. - So, Detective, what can we do for you? - It's what can I do for you. You heard about Anthony Albano, I'm sure? No, and Mickey, no, and Mickey O'mara, you didn't hear about that? Guess what? They're taking a big dirt nap, somebody whacked them out a few minutes ago. - Well, it's a dangerous neighborhood, Detective. - It is a dangerous neighborhood, you've got to be careful, you walk out in the street, get hit by a bus or something. I just came here to help you. I just want to throw something out there to you. - Is this friendly banter? Is that what this is? - Friendly banter, yes. But I'm here just to make sure you guys are safe, you fellows are all safe. - Well, if we hear anything that can help your case, I'm sure we'll be happy to give you a call. - You know how to find me. - Yeah, usually I look out the window, there you are. (laughter) - Good. - You say hi to your wife. - Say hello to your mother. And you, uh, say hello to Snow White and the rest of the fellows, huh? - Where the fuck is my brother? - Look, Toni, my brother's in charge now, and nobody's going to get in his way. You and I can forget all this nonsense, and go to London for real this time. - What, and just run away? I love this life. - Your father's way of life? It's over, time's changed. Yeah, he had long, good run, longer than most, but his time was up. You've said it to yourself 100 times. - What are you saying? - I'm saying that I loved your father, and I don't want to see him end up like that. - He really liked you, too, you know? He really did. - Yeah, well, birthday bash tonight for my brother at the club. I'll come by before I go. - Great day for Gaetano. He eliminates the competition, just in time for his birthday. - Come on, Toni, you know it's not like that. This is just business, my brother respected Anthony. - Mm, okay, if you say so. - I'm going to buy the airplane tickets. (techno music) - I told my wife that I'd be right back, I'd be back early, I told her. - That's my baby, I'm telling you. Mm wah Come here, come here. Mm wah. - Not a bad birthday party, huh brother? - Nice job, nice job. Listen, it's good to see you, you know? I mean, I'd talk to you, but when I call, you've got to answer. - I'm around, man. You don't know anything. - Yeah, I know anything. But you know what? I haven't seen you, and I don't care what you're doing, I don't know what you're doing, alright? But when I call, you've got to show up. - I was going over the notes. - Uh huh. - And you're saying 300 thousand? - Good point. - Yeah, I'm looking at my numbers, and saying oh, we're a few, you know, we're over a million. - Nah, I'm around, baby, you know that. - Anything for you. Well, I've got to see you more around, I've got to see you around the club, I've got to see you around the place, I've got to see you at a restaurant, I don't see you. What's that about? - You know, you've got to be right, my loyalty's to you. Don't ever question that, brother. - Jimmy, come on, you can't listen to her. - I can't listen to her? - No. - What are you doing, you calling my fucking girl a liar? - I'm not saying that, I'm just saying. - Oh, my God. - You're in charge now, right? Who am I to question? - That's right, I'm the boss. You understand that? - What are you fucking kidding me right now? - No, I'm not, no, listen. - Let me ask you something. - I could show you. Oh. - I'll fucking kill you if you fucking rob me. You understand? - Now, listen, after this Albano thing shakes out, we're going to send you and Jimmy on a trip, alright? - Good, you got it. Anywhere you need me to go, you know that. - Good, you're good with that, right? - For you, anything. - So, what've you got set up for us after? - Now get the one, get that guy right there to the right, see him? - I got him, I don't know who he is. - Through the window, through the window. And would you look at the size of that house. I mean, can you live in a house that's the size of a hotel? I mean, it's nuts. Liberal fucking judge couldn't give us the wiretap, motherfucker. - We need to get you and your sister together, go over the will. - Mm. - Hard to believe Anthony's gone. - Yep. Tomorrow is promised to no one. - Sweet Jesus, you're cold. - He was your employer. - He was more than that to me. He kicked my ass, straightened me out. Put me through law school. - He was fucking your mother. (click) (click) - You think this is a funeral? This is a feeding frenzy. Wonder what's going to happen now that the old man is dead, huh? Hey, you know that, that fucking coffee I had this morning, my fucking eyeballs are floating. Look, I've got to go take a piss. (murmuring voices) (foreign language spoken) - I'm very sorry to hear about your father. Listen, we're going to need to talk though. - Soon, not today, but soon. - I'll come back. My condolences. - Okay. - Any messages? - No. - You sure? - Yes. - You've checked that thing like 50 fucking times since we got here. Will you calm the fuck down? You could make coffee nervous. Waiting around here for this bitch just turns my stomach. - Would you keep your voice down? - Who are all these people? - The local industry. - I need a cigarette. - You need a Valium, and a glass of bourbon. Jesus, grow a pair of balls, why don't you? What, you think this skinny brat's going to have you whacked just for lighting up in her house? - Sorry for you loss. - Thanks. - We've got to talk. - Well, I can't talk right now. - It's kind of important. - Joey, I've got a room full of people. - Understood, but soon. Okay. - Detail sucks. Cavelli got us this crap. - [Cop 1] I mean, he's not going to sit out here in the fucking car. - No, of course not. - If you had a chance of banging Ava Albano, or Toni Albano who'd you put over the kitchen table? I'd, I'd take Ava. Because Toni would put you over the kitchen table. Ava was on surveillance, alright? And her boyfriend at the time, she was bitching that he bought her a necklace that only cost 27 fucking grand. So, she gets rid of the guy, and she keeps the 27 grand. She's like, the uh, all the women at Hallowed Beach in Five Towns. By the time they're 31, 32, they already been married two or three plastic surgeons, and they're like multi-millionaires. - [Toni] Take a walk around, Frank. - Don't you even want to know how I'm doing? He was my father, too. - No, Ava, I'm not interested in your feelings right now. - You like Johnny Pisano's sausage right, I, I hear you love Johnny Pisano's sausage. You know why it's so good? Because that big fat motherfucker, Frank-the-butcher-Marcello, okay, when he kills someone, he cuts their bodies up, and it goes into the fucking sausage. You eating like spleen, your eating decay, and rectum. (foreign language spoken) - You've got to make it a a little more spicy. - Johnny, how much is that (foreign word)? - Johnny, I just love your sausage. - Well, your husband better not find out. - We take care of that thing? - Yeah. I did what you said, it's all good. - Hold on. Hey, Rocko. Make something nice for my pal, Charlie over here. - Hey, John. - Hey, movie star. Nice suit. - Oh, you like what I'm wearing, you want my tailor's number? - How come you smell like Marc Anthony, and I smell like provolone cheese, huh? What's with this, you don't shave no more? - This is the style, what, you live under a rock? - The style comes and goes, you know that, right? Come on, I want to talk to you. You eat yet? - No, I didn't eat anything. (knocking) - Yeah? - I want to talk to your boss. - Why, what do you want? - Just do your job, errand boy, and get your boss, huh? - Errand boy? - That's right. - Is there a problem? - I'd like to speak with your client, Antonia Albano - In regards to? - In regards to the murder of her father, Anthony Albano. - Oh, we've already been questioned down at the precinct. Mrs. Albano was satisfied that the department is doing all it can to apprehend those responsible for her father's murder. Do you have other information on the case? - No, not this time. - [Man Wearing Tie] Any suspects? - Yeah, a few hundred. That's not funny, Detective. - Sorry, Counselor. - Miss Albano is not available to speak with you today. I'm going to suggest next time that you give a call first, save yourself the trip. - See you around. - Alright, tough guy. - [Toni] Well? - [Counselor] Just a fishing expedition. - Is he on Nunziatta's payroll? - This guy? Nah, he's a Boy Scout. - That's what I'm afraid of. - [Ava] Did he really need to die like that? Closed casket? - Live by the sword, die by the sword. - Please. - Would you take a look at the men surrounding us? These are dangerous men, Ava. And our father was their boss. - I don't believe that. - Oh, okay, well, you just keep your head up your ass, that's fine. - Well, Rich is not like that. - He's a lawyer, they're the worst. - I'm going to miss Dad. - Oh, stop. The only reason you're here is because you need more money for your nose candy. - I always thought you were a smart guy, G. But what you did was just plain stupid. - Albano was slowing down, okay, he was slipping. - We stayed off the front pages for 25 years. - It couldn't be helped. - What'd you say? - We discussed this. - Don't play me, movie star, please. - John, you and I both agreed that something had to be done with that old man. - That old man? You take it upon yourself to whack him out, without getting a green light from me, or the commission? That's plain arrogance and stupidity. - I'm sorry, John. - Sorry don't cut it. We're all over the news. Last week, Time magazine said, "The American Mafia is dead." And you, at one foolish act, fucked it up for us. - John, you're like my favorite uncle, okay, due respect, but you guys were moving too slow. Now, I made the right move, okay? It's on me, I'll take all the heat from the commission. - Jesus, no man's allowed in our business. You don't get it, do you? I saved your ass, the others wanted you in the ground. - Well, I appreciate that, John, thank you. But they're going to forget, okay? The others are going to forget once everything else starts up again, it's going to be business as usual. - What about the skirt, what about her? - What, she's going to take a walk. She knows enough to take the money and run. - I know Toni Albano, she's just like her father. - Toni Albano. That girl'd be crazy to come at me now. Come on, besides, I'm going to have all the Albano capos in my pocket by the end of the week. - Joan of Arc, did you ever hear of Joan of Arc? - Yeah. She was burned at the stake. - I'm talking to a brick wall here. Let me tell you something. You keep this up, keep going against the commission, nobody's ever going to save your life, I won't have the juice and nobody else. Nobody, you're dead. - John, I'm fine. And so are you. Don't worry about it. - That guy Peter is here from Toronto. He, he wants to see you. - It's okay. - I'll get him. (man speaks foreign language) - Si, I understand. (man speaks foreign language) Whatever arrangements my father had with Mario will continue. (man speaks foreign language) Si. (man speaks foreign language) (Toni speaks foreign language) - Get the license plates, man. Old man, old battle, man. He banged more women than Wilt Chamberlain. Ava and Toni, they must have like 15 fucking brothers and sisters they don't know about. And this fucking guy didn't believe in condoms, you know? Hey, Tony, put on a fucking wrapper on your rocket, baby. See if you can get it through that window over there, there, through the blinds. - It's open, just enough. - Who exactly was my father, Richard? - Your father was a complicated man. But he always made sure that you and your sister were taken care of, and that's all you need to know. - Bullshit, that's not good enough. - So when's this boyfriend of yours showing up? You know your father was not happy with you living up in Connecticut. - I know, I needed to get away. - Well, we need to sit down with your sister, and go over your dad's assets. - Mm hm, I know. - Okay. - Okay. - Well, check this out, check it out, man, oh. (click) Shit, that's got to be one of old Donald's girlfriends. Holy shit! - Oh, that's a wide load, huh? - Oh, man. - Well, maybe we should do that, set a later date, say next week in my office. - Jesus. - Toni's coming out of the house. - Look, sweetie pie, I'm not leaving here until we see that will. - Ah, you look well rested. - Oh, let's cut the bullshit, shall we? - What are you doing here today? - I want what's mine, what's owed to me. - My father took care of you quite well. - Nice try, honey. Your father loved me. After your mother died, I made him very happy. - My father had needs like any man, and that was his business. But he gave you cars, he gave you the clothes on your back, the condo you live in, and God knows what else. - He loved me. - Look, you were just the end of a long line of sluts that my father was banging. - I should kick your teeth in, you selfish skinny brat! - Your talk is as cheap as you are. - I don't have an army of goons to back me up, honey. - No, you don't. So, whatever's in the joint account, is yours. You can have it. - He promised me, he told me. - You were fucking my father while my mother was still alive! - He said he was very grateful for it. - Get the fuck out of here. - Don't fuck with me, Toni. - And if you go to the cops, or the press, I'll fuck you good. (click, click, click) - No, I got him, too. - Yeah, good on his mama looks. (click, click) - [Toni] How's business, Norton? - It's alright. Did you see the arrangement me and Carney sent? - [Toni] Yeah, it must've cost you plenty. - Oh, we figured it was the least we could do. - You should've put some of that money towards what you owe my family. - Well, I, we came here today. - To jerk me off? - No, not at all. - 165 thousand dollars. That's what you owe. - What? - Mickey O'mara, he's not here now. He's gone. He's not here to run interference for you two degenerates. I expect you to pay the money you owe my family by the end of this month. - You can't be serious. - I'm as serious as a heart attack. - Hey, business has been very good for you two fucking guys. Besides all the money you're making with the bulls, and those fucking lap dances. And don't think we don't know about those fucking whores and the coke deals these guys are doing on the side. We know every fucking thing. You understand? - I just. - Think, before you utter another word. I never liked you two. I want my money, and I want it by the end of the month. And if you're thinking about blowing me off, or running away, Frank will bring you back, he will find you, and it will give me great pleasure to watch him cut your balls off. Have a nice day. By the end of the month. (dreary, heavy music) (flushing) - They may let you keep the house. The rest is gone, you're out of the family business. - I am the daughter of Anthony Albano, I will not end up like the others. - Toni, you know these thick, heavy gimmes, they'll think nothing about slitting your throat from ear to ear. Since the feds froze you and your dad's assets, you're basically, uh. - Fucked, yeah. I know that, listen, we've got to clean up this mess. I need a meeting with Gaetano. - You're just putting off the inevitable. Gaetano's been after your dad's piece of the pie for years. You don't have the support of the other families, your own people'll be jumping ship soon. (thudding) (grunting) - Yeah, nice. Hey, what's up, Jimmy? - Hey. What's going on, Jim? - Hold on with it. - Yeah, I've got to stay in shape, you know, we've got a lot of shit going on. - Stay in shape? Looks like you're trying to give yourself a fucking heart attack. (laughter) - So, how we doing that Albanos over there? - Just like we said. They're running like fucking cockroaches. Like chickens without heads. - Yeah. Those skeletons are going to start crawling over here now. You heard from my brother? It's inevitable. If this sells, you're going to get him to do some work around here. - I talk to you, that's your call, Boss. - Free ride's over. Anybody else reach out? - Yeah, that fucking asshole, Pasqual. He's already trying to have a sit-down. - We have a lot of his shit. - Oh, yeah, you have no idea. - Alright, how about a pot of coffee? We're going to get a lot of sit-downs like this. - Come on. (rapid thudding) - Toni. Joey Apples and Pasqual want to see you tonight. - Tell them not too late, I'm tired. (chime tones) (knocking) - Your boyfriend's here, from Connecticut. - Oh, Michael, thank God. - That knuckle dragger, Frank, he wouldn't let me up here till I showed him a picture of you on my cellphone. - Well, I hope I was decent. - What do you need, Joey? - I need to know when you're moving out of this house. My moving company could come in here, pack up your stuff, and send it anywhere you want. - This ain't no social call, Toni. You and I, we have unfinished business. I want what's owed to me. - The Albanos have lived in this house for 40 years. And on your say so, a captain, in my family, you're going to toss us out onto the street? Oh, I don't think so. - Before you go handing over all your assets to Gaetano, you better make sure you pay me my part of the split from the airport job. - What are you talking about? - Don't be cute with me, Toni, and don't play me for no fucking fool. You and I both know Gaetano's moving in here. - This home is the property of double A Construction. (Toni laughs) You and your sister are a tiny part of that. You're going to sell this fucking joint. - Well, if you feel that way, why aren't you talking to Gaetano? - Gaetano's no fool. He knows it's been you running things around here. He's been looking to take over the Albano family for years, but just couldn't do it. - Joey Apples. You call yourself a friend of my father's. If he were here to see this, he'd, he'd cave in your head with a brick. - Bottom line, Toni, is you owe me. This whole family owes me. Me and my crew, we've been kicking back party. I've been a loyal capo to you and your father, and you know it. - Listen, your father was my boss, and he was my friend. Business is business. One way or the other, you're going to be out of this fucking house. So out of respect for him, pack up your shit. - I owe you nothing. I'll burn it down to the ground first. The family's froze me out, no broad's allowed, it's a boy's club only, remember? - You want to run this family? You want to keep your territories? Back me. You back me, I'll run this family. Yeah. - You'll run my family? - I'll run this family, and we'll make money together. - For years, I stood in your father's shadow, listening to your fucking bullshit. Those days are over, girl. - I'll survive. - No, this is where you're wrong. And you'll see it soon, and then you'll be crawling back to me. - Fucking bullets will explode. - You think about it. (dramatic music) - [Ralph] Look, Toni, my brother's in charge now, and nobody's going to get in his way. - You're just putting off the inevitable. - [Richard] Gaetano's been after your dad's piece of the pie for years. - [Joey] No one's going to back you now that your old man's in the ground. - You don't have the support of the other families, your own people'll be jumping ship soon. - Your father's way of life, it's over, time's changed. Out of respect for him, pack up your shit. - [Pasqual] You owe me, this whole family owes me. - He was my father, too. Don't you even want to know how I'm doing? - I'm not interested in your feelings right now. (man speaking foreign language) - [Joey] One way or the other, you're going to get out of this fucking house. - [Toni] I'll burn it to the ground first. - [Richard] It's hard to believe Anthony's gone. - Tomorrow is promised to no one. I'll survive. (suspenseful music) - Where is she? - Sleeping. - I'm going to wake her up. Have you lost your mind? You told Joey Apples you're staying put? Hm? - Bad news travels fast. - What the hell's got into you? I thought we were getting out of here together. - You know the U.S. Attorney's office, they've frozen all my accounts. I have no access to anything overseas, I'm totally fucked. I'm lucky I have cash in the safe. - [Ralph] I have enough for the both of us, you know that. - Well, that's not good enough. I'm not leaving like that. - Well, I can't save you if you stay. What do you want from me, huh? Let's forget about all this bullshit, and meet in London like we planned. - It's over, I'm not going anywhere. Your brother's going to try to take everything from me, and you're not lifting a finger to stop him. - You didn't expect me to cross my own brother, did you? I did the best that I could. - Well, that's not good enough. - [Ralph] What are you saying? - I'm going to have to kill your brother. - What? That's never going to fucking happen. - Really? - Really. You could never get to my brother anyway. You'd have to go through Scarpetta, Jeruso, Tommy, Tat, Junior fucking Almato, Jimmy C. and me. - Goodbye. (dramatic music) I'm sorry, Ralphy. And just for the record, you were a lousy lay. - You know, this wasn't in the plan. - Things change. Can you clean this up? - Sure, that's what I do, remember? - Do I have blood on my face? - No, you look good. - Hi. - Hey. - I called St. Vincent's, and they're going to come pick up my dad's things tomorrow. You know, we used to be close. We used to play here all the time. But after Mom died, she changed. It was like, well, everything changed. But especially Toni. She started acting like my mother. She was controlling, she wanted to know every move I made, I had a mother, I didn't need her. So, I left. And I never regretted it, really. Till now. - Clancy? Fuck him. The deal died with Clancy when Anthony died. - You saw Toni, and I know because I paid a visit myself. The future of the Albano family's got one foot on the fucking banana peel. - This whole fucking thing is upside down. We're under new management now. We'll see what we can get, you know, a little bit of something. It's better than nothing. - Take a seat. I'd offer you a cup of coffee, but you look like a live wire. What's on your mind? - I was thinking maybe we should talk. - The boss isn't even cold yet, and you're looking out for your future? - Yeah, I, I got a few questions I need to ask. What's going to happen to my crew? Who's going to run my family? You know what I'm talking about? - Your family died with your boss. Get it? - I was thinking maybe me and Joey Apples. We could, uh, make a deal with you and the other five families. - What's a five letter word for idiot? - Moron. - Moron. You and Joey Apples don't got the weight to make deals. Now, me and the other bosses, we talked about it, and we think the best thing is to split up that family. - Gaetano's a fucking snake, Toni's a fucking broad, who the fuck would think a fucking broad, I mean, what the fuck is the world coming to? - Listen, the two of us, we've just got to stick together, and we'll get through this. Agreed? - Alright. - You alright? You want a glass of water or something? Cosmo. Get this gentleman a nice glass of ice water. You didn't happen to see my brother, Ralphy over at Albano's, did you? - No, I wasn't there that long, I didn't see nobody. - You sure? - 100 percent. - He's not answering his cell. - Have you seen Ralph? I've been trying to get ahold of him on his cellphone, and I'm not getting dick. - Listen, he's upstairs with the boss. You know what I mean. - Yeah, but. - Just leave them alone right now. It's no big deal. Don't bother them, alright? We'll go up by the garage, I've got a nice bottle of bourbon in there. You, you like cigars? Smoke a cigar too. - I don't get it, Frank Why are you still here? - [Frank] I'm a creature of habit. - So the broad, Toni. - You know I could help you with her. - You're a smart fellow, Pasqual. But don't try to play me. You saw your boss go in the ground, you figured you'd be right after him, right, so you come over here? Now, I know you and your crew have been busting those banks up in Queens and Brooklyn. How many banks, Jimmy? - 23. - 23. Holy shit. - Fucking guy? - That's pretty good. But I also know that you didn't kick back Albano's taste on those jobs. Now if you did that with me, you'd be fish food. (dramatic music) That's not going to happen with me. You're going to continue to be a good earner, you're going to be a real team player. From now on. You understand? - I understand. (boom) - Hey. You got promoted to the majors. You got traded to my team. Look at it that way. - Hm. - We're clear now, right? Now, what did Cavelli want? - Cavelli? - Boys. So how's things in the smut business? - How the fuck did you get in here? - Door was open. - [Man Seated] You just can't come waltzing in here. - You don't like it, call a cop. - Can I get you something, Detective? How about a cup of coffee? - How about a little lawsuit? (laughter) - That fucking coat, that's a good one, Joe. - Nice fucking cigars you got here. - Yeah, what do you want here, Detective? - Just here investigating the Albano homicide. - Let me ask you something. What are you fucking down here breaking our balls for? You know we ain't going to talk to no fucking copper. - Joey, he ain't that smart. He thinks me and you whacked Anthony Albano. - I just got to take you pricks off my list, that's all. Now, um, Don Joses, Luis Casillas? It's a beautiful cigar. You know, a fucking truckload of these were lifted from LaGuardia Airport. - You don't say. - Yeah. But, you two wouldn't know anything about it anyway. - What are the odds? What a fucking amazing coincidence. - What's this fucking world coming to, Detective? - Yeah. - Well, listen boys, thanks for the cigar, and uh, try to stay healthy, huh? - He was just fucking with us, he doesn't know nothing. - You talk to that scumbag cop again, I'll kill you myself. - It's alright. You just keep you mouth shut from here on in, alright? Does that sound like a plan? Alright, get the fuck out of here and do whatever it is you do. - He ain't going to fuck with me. - I'm going to need another word for asshole. - Everything alright? - Yeah, I. - What? - I just needed a quiet place to make a phone call. Emergency at work. (suspenseful music) - Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Why is Sal driving Ralphy boy's car? Fuck it, come on, let's tail him. (dramatic music) - Oh, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. I'm Michael. - What is it you do? - Travel agent. I own a small agency in New Haven. - And my fiance. - Ah. Irish, nice curtains. Mother took good care of you. Congratulations. I'm sure you'll both be very happy. Now, if you could excuse us for a moment. - He stays with me. - This is family business. - Yeah, that's for the best, Ava. - Stay out of this, Richard. - It's okay, Ava. I'll be outside the door if you need me. - Oh, good Lord. Okay, what do we got? - Your dad left you each 500 thousand dollars. - And? - And that's it. - Joey said he expected us to vacate. - What? - He said the house was in the company's name, now how that could be, I don't know. - I assumed you knew. The house was under the company contract, but I never dreamed that they would as you to leave. - Well, that's not happening. I'm not going to bend over for these motherfuckers. I'm keeping control over what's mine. - You are not in control over anything. Legally, it's not yours. Everybody knew that you were running the Albano family, your power came from your father. - This is the life he gave me. This is the only life I know. I will keep this family's assets. And I will not go down without a fight. - You've burned bridges, you have no allies. All the other families knew that Anthony was slipping. You running the family kept him alive another two years. You know how these grease balls think, uh, as long as everybody's making money, they'll look the other way. - 500 thousand dollars is not going to last long. - You must have something stashed away. - You know, I've heard enough. - You are not going anywhere until I tell you. - You don't have the right to. - It is not safe out there, I can't protect you. - Protect me? - These are associates of our father, they won't hesitate to kill you and dump your body, do you understand? - I am not a part of this. - You are. - I am not a part of this. - You're an Alabano, by defacto, you are a part of this. They'll try to use you to get to me, what aren't you understanding about this? - She's right, sweetheart, you're fucked. - You're not going anywhere, now, get out of here. - Oh, don't even tell me. - And get me Frank. - You ladies need to make a truce. - My sister can be such a bitch. You know, she can't make me stay. - Maybe we should stay a little while, give her a chance to get to know me better. - You don't know my sister. - Hey, hey, hey. Things change, give it a chance. Look, we'll get your finances in order first. - I just inherited a half a million dollars. Right? - Hm. - So. That's going to take care of my debt, and then you'll take care of me. (cellphone ringing) - I, uh, I've got to take this. - Really? You can't call him back? - It can't wait. Emergency at the office. You're going to get me killed, you know that? Yeah, I placed them. Hey, look, you guys got my back, right? (dramatic music) - What are you doing, my man? - Uh, dumping some garbage. - Police, show me your hands. Come on! - Gun! (succession of shots) (cellphone ringing) - Yeah? What? No, no, no. Say that again? Where are they? What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Calm the fuck down. Just tell me what happened. Where are the feds? Who called them off? Who's watching the fucking house? What do you mean nobody? No, I'm not fucking yelling at you. Alright, fuck this shit. Where, where are the cops? Listen, tell their wives, get somebody here to pick them up, and I'll meet you at the hospital, man. Fuck. - Where's my sister? - Upstairs. Look, I know things have been tough for you, and you haven't exactly been close. Maybe you can put aside your differences and be a real family. - Mm. Look, Dr. Phil, you don't know me, and I don't know you, and you sure as shit don't know anything about my family, so take some friendly advice, and go fuck yourself. What, are you fleecing the place? Your boyfriends not going to be able to help you when the bull dykes start passing you around in some federal penitentiary. - They want you, don't dump this on me. - Why do you think Daddy was using your accounts? - I don't know, Toni, I don't know shit. - Maybe it's because there were large sums of money being passed through them. It's a guess. Listen you were a part of this whether you want to believe it or not. - This is insane. - Ah. - Kind of early for that shit. - Okay, Mom. One more. One more. Oh, Gaetano, glad you could make it. - What am I doing here? - Hey, you know why they make gold chains? To remind you Italians where to stop shaving. (cackling laughter) - That's why I drove all the way down here? To listen to this bullshit? - No, no, no. A business deal. - [Gaetano] Business deal. - We want you to come in with us. - In this joint, like a partner? - Oh, uh, this place, and maybe the Misty Mood, too. You know. - Oh, yeah. You want me to be your partner? - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, gee, thanks. - Yeah. - That's really sweet of you. - Well, you know, we go back. - What do you think I'm fucking stupid? - What? - Toni Albano's got a piece of this place, no? - That was just a loan, besides, Toni's gone. - She's not gone, she's fine. - I thought you meant, I thought you meant her old man. - Are you a fucking idiot? - Hey, there's a lot of Tonys. You, you know why there's so many Italians named Tony? Because before they got on the boat, in Italy, their mothers would pin a little card on their jacket that said, "To NY." Tony. Tony. - That's funny, go ahead, laugh. - A fucking comedian. (laughter) (pop) (thudding) (groaning) Fucking bullshit! You fucking disrespect me again, you motherfucker, you disrespect me again, you stupid motherfucker. Piece of fucking shit. Shut the fuck up! You're lucky I don't fucking kill you, too, you fucking piece of shit. Bad enough I got to drive to this shit neighborhood, and I've got to listen to your bullshit. You go to her before me? Irish fuck, you disrespect me again, I'll fucking kill you. And I'll kill you, too, I'll kill both of you motherfuckers, and I'll put your fucking head on my fucking mantels. (painful groaning) Don't make me come back. - I, I. Fuck. - I'm sorry, Toni. You know, being back here, after all this time, is, it's been crazy. You know, we haven't fought like this since mom died. - You remember when she found that pack of butts in my purse? - Yeah, I do, and she kicked your ass. - I deserved it, I lied to her. - You did. You know it's amazing, though, you look exactly like her. Remember that song, um, Dad used to sing it to Mom, all the time. It was like, sweet iris, it was Irish. - My Wild Irish Rose. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Toni. I've been gone too long. - Yeah, you have. (dramatic music) (rumbling engine) - Hey. What are you doing? - I'm looking for you. They called here twice looking for Ralph Nunziatta. You can't just disappear a guy like that. - Will you stop your whining, you work for me now. He was here, now he's not here, that's all they need to know. Ah. (pouring) - Gaetano's people are looking for Ralph again. I'm not good at this. - Bullshit. You're a lawyer. A professional liar, just do what comes natural. - Fuck me. (dark, intense music) - Michael. Where you going? Did you, uh, know that your boyfriend is leaving bugs in our house? - No, you think that I did that? No, I've never seen that before in my life. - I watched the home surveillance, stupid. - So who you working for, Mikey boy? Huh? Huh? The state cops, the feds? The attorney general's office? - The DEA agents office, they busted me. I was moving some stuff for some friends. One deal to make lots of money. - Stuff? What kind of fucking stuff, what are you moving dolls? - It was heroin. Look, I didn't have a choice. - Everybody has a choice, Michael. Did you really think you were going to waltz in here and make us look like fools? Are you kidding me? - All he cares about is his fucking self. - I am not like you people. I can't go to jail. - How long have you been working for them? - Yeah, go ahead, tell her. - Ah, you fucking prick! Heroin? All this time, pretending you were better than me and my family. - Fuck you, cheese eating motherfucker. - What are you going to do? Be sensible. The DEA's office knows I'm here. You can't kill me. - Really? - Ava, I'm sorry. I didn't want this to happen. I love you. And I'm not like you people. I'm going to open this door now, and I'm leaving. (choking) (sad music) ♫ Ah ♫ Ah, oh ♫ Ah ♫ Oh - You still need my help? - You're free to go. But you must go far away. I can clean this mess up. You should have enough to get started. And once the smoke clears, I'll make sure Richard sends you more. - You can come with me. - Sorry, I can't. (forlorn music) - You know, if they're going to come at us, it's going to be real soon. We've got to be ready. - If you want to leave, I understand. If the ship goes down, you don't have to be on it. - Listen, if Gaetano hasn't restocked all his shit, we're as good as dead. But I'm not good at running. - Me neither, Frankie. (rapid thuds) (click, click) - If you got three guys coming at you, you aim for the middle one, and all three of them go fucking down. - Never used to be this complicated. Tell somebody to do something, they do it. Now a 100 people got to tell you what they think first. Everybody's got an opinion. Then the most important voice gets lost, and then nothing gets done. There's no respect for the chain of command anymore. - Frankie. - What? - Did I ever say thank you to you? Thank you. - Toni, you know, you don't ever have to say thank you to me. I mean, how many years we been together? Huh? As a family, your father raised me. I don't have a mother or a father no more, it's all you. You're my, you're the only family that I have. Do you understand? You are my sister. - My brother, he's MIA anytime he wants, and he doesn't call me back. And this woman. You know, I've got to type in code and send her a little message to setup a face to face to straighten out this bullshit. I've got to type it in, and send it. (cellphone tone) - Gaetano's willing to meet. - That's nice of him. - 15 years ago, would she be a problem? She'd know her place. - Remember when we were young? Where your father used to say, "Make sure you "take care of my daughter. "Make sure you make sure nobody goes near her, "make sure she's safe." - You'd always have my back. - I will protect you till my dying last breath. - It's fucking internet. It's a different world. That's why I like to have you around, big fellow. You know how to keep your thoughts to yourself. Let's get the car. (rumbling hiss of traffic) (foreboding music) Nice spot you picked out here. Got two security cameras, you got some traffic cameras in the parking lot. - And a precinct around the corner. - You look good. I haven't seen you in awhile. You know I went to school with your sister, but I always had a thing for you, you know that? You see my brother Ralph today? - Yeah, a few hours ago, he uh, he was there with that moron. - Rizzo. - Yeah. Rizzo, big ugly one. - So, we're here. I just have one question. When do you plan on vacating the premises? - Don Nunziatta I have no plans to vacate the premises until I get some answers. - Answers? - Answers, like, who put the hit on my father? - I don't know. - You're such a cocksucker, you know that? Of course you know. We all know. - Sweetheart, why would I have your father killed? I mean, Jesus Christ, he was the only Albano with a sense of humor. - You couldn't hope to be half the man my father was. - Okay. Why don't you ask those two nitwits that work for your family, um, Pasqual and uh, Joey Apples. They've been skimming off you for awhile now. Everybody knows it. In fact, the Albano family's becoming a joke. You're thinking. Good for you. - Between you and me, we both know who killed my father. And you will pay for it. - You've got some balls, I'll give you that. Unlike your father, I'm not a patient man. I don't believe in threats, but, I'm going to promise you that as soon as we're done with your beautiful baby sister, we're going to start on you. - I slit his throat. - What? - I slit your brother's throat. - Are you fucking with me right now? - Yeah. - Get home to your sister. She shouldn't be alone right now. - Bitch. - I don't care what she said, find Ralph. Jimmy, let's get this done. Send it all over. - Where you going, Mr. Lawyer? - Home for a bit. Shit, shower, shave, I'll be back. - You better watch your ass. - I'll be fine. I'm just a mouthpiece, right? (suspenseful music) - Why don't you just give them the house? - It's not about the house. It's about everybody disrespecting this house. - The surveillance has been cut. Frankie, take Ava to the boiler room. You don't come out of there unless you hear a knock. - Don't move from this room, alright? You're going to hear a lot of gunshots, it's going to sound like fireworks. But don't worry, I'm going to come back to get you, soon as everything stops. - Okay. - You stay calm. Go ahead. (intense music) - Toni, it's been a long time, huh? (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) I'm sorry about your father. (speaks in foreign language) (boom) (rapid shots) (gunshots) (gunfire) (knocking) (boom) - Hello, little sister. (Ava screams) Drop that gun, or I kill your sister like I killed your father. - Not today. (shot) (boom) ♫ Ah, ooh ♫ Ooh (Ava cries softly) - Listen to me. I will settle this mess with Gaetano. - Hey, Johnny. (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) - Carmine, you're a true cop. Always showing up on time for dinner. - Yeah, yeah. Well, you know what my Uncle Eugene always says, bad news is easier to swallow with food. - Yeah? Well, that's good, cause I just ate. - Really? Well, I'm going to fuck up your dessert right now. Your boy, Larry Rizzo? You know Larry Rizzo. We found him in the trunk of your brother's car. And somebody shot him in the back of the head, blew off the right side of his face. - What the fuck are you talking about? - You know DeStephano? Crazy Horse DeStephano, Sal DeStephano? Yeah, well guess what, he's fucking pushing up daisies now, too. And I've got two of my fucking cops in the hospital. Two cops with fucking families. Homicide wants to talk to your brother. - I don't know where he is. - You don't know where Ralphy boy is? - I don't know where he is. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, listen. We're going to find Ralphy boy, see, when we find him, we're going to take care of him, and then we're going to take care of you. Hey, today's paper? You mind? My horoscope, I missed my horoscope today. "Everything's coming up roses." Ain't that fucking beautiful? Hey, here you go. Have fun with your dessert. And have a cannoli for me, huh? - Fuck. Cocksucker. - Oh, oh. - Sorry. - It's alright. - We need to talk. - What the fuck are you doing here? - We really need to talk. - It's alright, it's alright. - The men you sent to kill the Albanos are dead. I saw it. I was there. Watched it all from behind the bushes, they're all dead. - How about those bitches? - Maybe you ought to hear Toni's offer first. - Oh, she's got an offer now. - Toni killed your brother, you killed her father, that cleans the slate, she wants out. One million dollars. Call it, uh, an exit tax. Toni and Ava walk, leave the country, never to be heard from again. You get it all, they get your assurance that you won't hunt them down. - And how do they know I'm going to keep my word? - If something happens to them, I have instructions to mail a package to the attorney general's office. 500 thousand now, the other half tonight. Look me up at Pisano's restaurant, we meet in public, seven thirty. You know it's the smart play. - Get the fuck out of here. - Well, it's all set with the bartender. Don't worry about it. You know why the cops call it organized crime? - [Gaetano] I got fucked up. - Again. - Again, I got fucked up again. - Very sloppy, very messy. - Just tell everybody that I got it under control, okay? I've got it handled. - How? You going to let her kill some more of your boys? - I'm going to make a financial arrangement. She's going to walk, she's going to disappear. - Well, you're not going to walk without kicking something in to us. - What do you want? - We're going to take the Albano business, and divide it up equally. - What do I get? - What do you get? You get to keep breathing, that's what you get. Now, get the fuck out of here. Fucking punk. (hum of traffic) - Hey, how you doing, sexy? - [Bartender] Hey. - Things good? - Things are good. - Good, good, good. - How about you? You look good. - Ah, man, I'm feeling much better now. Everything seems to have worked out for the best so far. Have uh, you seen my friend Joey around? - [Bartender] Yep. - [Pasqual] He left me something? - Yep. This is for you. - That's great. Thank you, thank you very much. How about a kiss? - [Bartender] Always for you. - Am I going to see you again later tonight? - Of course, the usual place. - Alright, great. I've got to run to the bathroom, I'll be right back. - I'll freshen this up for you. (dreary music) (boom) - Hey, Joey, have a great night, man. - Take it easy, I don't like gelato. How about you girls beat it? I got some business to take care of, but I'll be calling you soon. (pop) (heavy, gloomy music) (foreboding music) ♫ Ah ♫ Ah ♫ Oh, oh, oh ♫ Oh, oh (shots) (shots) (rapid shots) ♫ Oh, ah ♫ Oh, ah, oh ♫ Oh ♫ Ah, oh ♫ Oh ♫ Ah, oh - This is a fucking waste of time. She was on her way back to the other side by now. - Maybe? - It's either that, or we're going to find them floating in Sheep Head's Bay, you know what I'm talking about? - I hear you. At least Christmas is coming, get a little overtime out - of this. - Oh, a little overtime won't hurt. - The only people who are going to be missing these two clowns is their mothers. Hey, here's your notebook.
