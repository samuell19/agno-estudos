Miriak, down, repeat Miriak is down. Multiple hostiles in sight, Request permission to engage, over. Permission denied, Death Angel. Your extraction point is five clicks away, x-vil at 10:00, satellite shows multiple enemy hostiles at your location. Bear, you copy that? We need to move or we're not gonna make it. Roger that. We got bad intel, there's more threats then reported. Lay some hate, brothers, lay some hate. Death Angel, your QRF team just went out on another mission. Don't get any crazy ideas, you're on your own. Gotta love those budget cuts. Bear, we gotta move to the extraction point now. I'll get us in, you get us out. Bear, we're gonna miss out exit window, we gotta move now. Copy that, Cowboy Bear is off comms. Nash, get him out of there. No one come for you, you are expendable, no? We both know we're not gonna talk, so why don't you just get on with whatever you need to get on with. We don't want you to die too soon, that would ruin our fun and my experiment. Nothing strikes fear into my men more than when they hear the Marines are coming. You have very big price on your head, you must be proud. How did you find our location? If you tell me what I want to know, you will save yourself and your friends a lot of pain. I call this the tour of Afghanistan, only the purest of heroin for our celebrity. She will be your greatest lover and your worst enemy, all in one. Focus on this beautiful woman, your girlfriend, and tell me everything or you will never see her again. Bear, Bear. Hey, you get us in, I get us out. Now we gotta go, and we still gotta find Ryan and Nash while the guards are still at a call to prayer. Up Marine, let's go. Okay hold, hold, hold. Come on, let's go, move, Marine. Let's go. Come on, I got you, I got you, come on. We want our weapons and our gear, then you're gonna tell us where we are. - You'll never make it. - No? Okay. - Who won't make it? - Wait, your weapons are next door down. Get the laptop, I'll tell you what you want to know. Hey, me and Ryan can take of the rest of the guards, you guys get out of here with this intel. That intel's priceless. Meet us three clicks due north at 06:30, Semper Fi, boys. If we're not up there by 06:30, you guys move out. Maintain radio silence until 06:30. You're alright, Cowboy? Alright. Lost sheep to Shepherd, Lost sheep to Shepherd, come in. - I said Lost sheep to Shepherd, Lost sheep to Shepherd, come in. - Move out, don't wait, - we're a little tied up. - Keep fighting we're coming back. - That's a negative, Death Angel, proceed as planned. - En route to you hold fast. Negative, we found Comms, air strike called, danger close. - ETA? - ETA 30 seconds, tell my son I'm proud of him, - even if stirs three. - Get out of there. Semper Fi. They were our responsibility, Bear, our responsibility, - and we got them killed, no, you broke them rules. - Keep your voice down. None of this had to happen, man. This is your fault, Bear. We kill Hajis, that's what we do, as many as we can, as often as we can. We kill them all. And Ryan and Nash just paid the price. We move right now or we die, now get up. Besides, Mia wants that baby you promised. Baby, it's useless, now leave me, or leave me alone. I am not leaving you, Cowboy now get up. Get up. This aint going away, Bear. Alright, move your legs not your lips, let's go. And exactly when can I go home? That's what we're trying to figure out right now. Looks like your amylaseand lipaselevels are elevated and your liver function really isn't what we want it to be. I mean, you've gotta understand that they injected you with some pretty bad stuff. - Such as? - That's part of the puzzle we're trying to put together now. I understand this is difficult for you, just try to be patient. Bear? - God, you're alive. - I promised I was coming back for you, Skylar. - Remember the plan? - Yeah, I remember the plan. Get you out of here, you wanted space, I gave you space. Yeah, you gave me plenty of space. You broke up with me three years ago. - Let's just start over again. - Why, so you can leave me again? - I had to leave. - You chose to leave. I was protecting you. No, you were running. I hear the guys call you Doctor Rev, so you're a reverend and a doctor, you heal the body and the soul? Well, I don't really heal anything, I just... I don't know, just try to help out a little bit, that's all. See now you're talking, see I want out of here today, Doc, and that's what's gonna help me. I tell you what, if you let me out of here today, I'll go to one of your little Bible meetings you do with the guys, deal? Jesus would want you to let me go. So you're telling me you know Jesus. Oh yeah, he was on my first sniper team, Hispanic guy, five foot seven, great shot. Jesus has got skills. Yeah, looks like Chris has got jokes. Spare me the sermon, Doc I know all about Jesus. I guess I just feel guilty because I only call on him when I'm getting shot at. You know it's not really about that, right? If you wanna be my friend, Doc, let me out of here. Oh Chris, I am your friend, and trust me I want you out of here 'cause you're driving me nuts, man. I'll check in with you soon, buddy. Sign me out, Doc. Bear, what are you doing here? Just thought we'd hang out a little bit. With a box of my favorite chocolate? That's not random, do you remember the time that you stole a box from Howard's, and we scarfed the entire thing in the alley? We got so sick. My dad got ahold of us, made us clean the entire gym. Your dad drove me to the boys home, he almost dropped me off. I think he would've, if you weren't such a great fighter. - So what is all this? - I wanna fix this. There's nothing to fix, everything's fine. I promised you I'd be back, and now we're like this. You left me. I see you, I hear your dad's words coming out. Don't blame dad, he took you in and he trained you, and he got you a title fight. You had a shot at the title, and you blew it. There's something you need to know about that fight. It's too late, you lost and then you ran away, and I am not the girl that you leave. I'm the girl you hold onto. Skylar. ♪ When did I become so lost ♪ When did I lose myself ♪ All the words That leave my tongue ♪ ♪ Feel like they come From someone else ♪ ♪ I'm paralyzed Where is the real me ♪ ♪ I'm lost And it kills me inside ♪ ♪ I'm paralyzed Bear, Bear, Bear! Let's go, we're not gonna make it. Ryan and Nash were our responsibility, our responsibility! I am not the girl you leave behind, Bear. If you love me, let me go. She will be your greatest lover and your worst enemy all in one, your love and your hate for her will never go away. Tell my son I'm proud of him. - This guy's rolling, man. Wakey, wakey. - Wake up, fool. - I hope you've got something for us. - Here's one, here's one. Oh, he's playing dead on us. Watch out. Get up, wake up, wake up. Get on the ground! Get up, come on. Hey. Hey! Get up, get up, get up. Look what you did. Why would I let him go? It's in everyone's best interest. Everyone's best interest? I don't speak bureaucracy, who is this guy and why would I let him go? His name is Bear, and the rest is top secret. - All things exaggerated. - Look, Hardwick, his team is our most lethal weapon, that's all I can say. Now let's just pretend that Bear doesn't exist and that this whole thing didn't happen. I take assault and battery on my men pretty seriously. You're lucky they're not dead. Besides your department has had seven brutality complaints in the last year and if this goes to press, you're gonna have another riot on your hands. So, let's just call this even. On who's authority? As high as I need to go. Charlie, is he a good guy or a bad guy? He's necessary. Necessary. Bear, this can't happen again, did you hear me? This isn't Afghanistan. Sometimes the lines get blurry, but these are the people that we're supposed to protect. We're gonna get you a little help, we owe you that much. You will report here regularly for treatment. That is an order, do you understand? Well, I still think you need to treat in-house, but I mean if you don't want too, that's fine too. I'll write you a prescription for your withdrawals. I almost forgot, remember what we talked about, you know, just in case you need it. That's just really not my thing. No, I'm not trying to push it on you, it's just uhm... Leave it laying right there. You never know, Bear, you might just change your mind. Hey, Doc, tell me you got my test results back because my wife wants me back home if you know what I mean. Yeah, I've got them right here. Let me guess, I've got six months to live. I wish we had that much time. Doc's always got jokes, that's not funny. Actually that's kind of cruel. I'm not making a joke, Chris. Buddy, you have three months to live. Are you serious? Well, check it again because that's wrong, I'm, I'm fine. Chris, I've run them three times. When they captured you, they injected you with something called zinc cadmium sulfide, it gets into your system and tries to poison it, it tries to shut your organs down. They, they've got to have a cure, we're only ten minutes away from the CDC. It doesn't matter, the VA they're not gonna pay for it 'cause they can't afford it, they're broke. What are you saying to me, man? I'm sorry. You're sorry? Yes, it is. You're sorry, you're sorry. I wanna be alone, Doc. - Listen, Chris if you... - I wanna be alone, please. - I understand. - No, you don't understand. Three months! - Hey, Doug. - Hey, Bear. Hey, man I need you to hook me up, contract job, private sector, good pay. Cowboy needs helps paying for his medical treatment. You still got your TS clearance? - No man, they got me benched. - I'm sorry, Bear. No clearance no work, bro. There's nothing I can do. There's gotta be something. Bear, you remember that kid Tommy Brown, that Seal we worked with in Iraq? - Yeah, man, good guy. - Yeah well, look he's about to fight this psycho Darwin. God I hope he gives this guy a beating. Need to get back in the ring, Bear, that's gonna be your ticket. - Hey. - Hey, I heard somebody's been asking for a cowgirl. That would be me. - Are you not happy to see me? - I'm always happy to see you. We're gonna be fine, I have some news. You're gonna be a dad. A dad? I thought you would be ecstatic. I... I'm very excited, I mean, this is fantastic, we're gonna have a baby. I... I just wanna get out of here. Wait, were you gonna tell me something else? Yeah, no, look we're gonna have a baby. - I love you, baby. - I love you too. I thought you were gonna leave me again. No, I'm not leaving you ever again. - We did it. - Yeah. After all these years, we finally did it. Yeah, we did. We're gonna have a baby. Yeah. - Hmm. - I love you so much. I love you. I'm gonna go get a snack, I gotta feed the baby. Yeah, you do. What was supposed to be an exhibition match to help wounded veterans, turned tragic only minutes ago. Tommy Brown the former Navy Seal turned MMA fighter faced Jabari Darwin, the reigning light heavy weight Mixed Martial Arts World Champion. We take you now to Corrine Dyer who was live on the scene. Darwin the most controversial fighter in MMA took this fight in an attempt to clean up his reputation. These cheap shots literally knocked Tommy Brown into a coma as his son watched the tragic ordeal from the front row. Darwin is now suspended for a year if not permanently. Here comes Darwin now, Darwin, tell us your thoughts. What would you tell Tommy's son right now? I'd tell him what I tell everybody else, your pop should never have got in the cage with me. He knew the consequences and he suffered the risk. But this was an exhibition match that was supposed to help clean up your reputation, you clearly made it worse, in fact you've recently been suspended from Mixed Martial Arts for a year, how did that help your career? Look lady, I don't gotta talk to you, man. Get out of my face. There you have it, folks. Let's go! Be careful, Bud. What can I do for you? Is Coach Bronx still around? Uh, yeah he's in his office. Are you a friend of his? - Yeah. - Are you gonna get a membership? I can give you the first month free, but don't expect many favors from me. Cody Blackbear, come to visit your old trainer huh? Skylar told me you were in town. - How you've been, son? - Outstanding. Yeah, well you look good. I thought you'd be all shot up by now. Sorry to disappoint you. So you're still dancing with the devil? No, I gave up dancing, but the band keeps playing don't you know. Oh come on, just a game. Nah, I'm expecting a grandchild, but I'm sure Skylar mentioned that. Congratulations. Thank you, Bear. I knew you'd understand. Understood. You always made your position on me and Skylar very clear. It was Skylar's decision. Skylar's decision? I stayed out of it. I'm older and wiser. Oh, you're wise... now. Bear, she's moved on, she's finally happy. Red? Engineer, graduated from Tech, helps me train. He breaks down fighters stats, and all that smart stuff, you know? So you're still training then? Yeah, we got lots of kids in here. Keeps them off the streets. Off the streets... A role model. Father Teresa here. What's going on, Bear I never said that. I never said I was a role model. I still see the same old broken down nightmare. Are you drunk, Bear? So you gonna train me, or be my life coach? Train you? You can't be serious about fighting again, pal. Is that why you're here? I'm here for your wisdom. I can't train you, Bear there's too much... Just too much. Tell you what, Bear you can work out here. I cannot train you. I know you got more than this. Come on, you can do better. Three more. Three more, I can't even do one. Let me see here, I think they gave me the wrong paperwork. - What's that? - Because it says here, mistakenly of course, that you're a Marine, but let me correct that, 'cause you're more like a Girl Scout. I see you failed out of charm school. Oh, and I see the Marines made an exception to the "man", in we're looking for A Few Good Men. Easy, easy, easy, how you doing, buddy? Oh, everything's wonderful, I feel like I'm in Disneyland, I'm having so much fun. Oh, don't worry, Doc it'll get tougher, I'm just easing him into it. Well, I kinda got some good news for you. We have an anonymous donor that's gonna help you get into that treatment program that we talked about. It's not gonna get you all the way through it, but it is gonna get you started, and Nurse London here she's gonna get you back on track. Does Nurse London also specialize in waterboarding? Nurse London is the best that we have, so just stick to the program, Girl Scout. So does Mia know about your diagnosis? No, not yet. Hey, pappy. - Hey. - Hey. I can't wait to show you the nursery. I love you, Mia. I carried Bear over the mountains of Afghanistan just to see that smile again. Pretty sure I heard that a little different. I'm sure. I don't think I'm gonna be there when our baby is born. Okay, okay so you'll be in here, we'll just... we'll just figure it out. Here, I won't be here. Another mission? You told me you were getting out, you can't go. - You can't go. - My last mission was my last mission, Mia. Take another mission, it'll kill me. I mean, I've only done it like a thousand times. There are no more missions, Mia. I'm dying. My organs are shutting down, I... No, no, no, no, pappy, no, no, we're starting a family. - No. - No, and you're gonna be right there beside me. - You're not going anywhere. - You've gotta be strong, Mia. You've gotta be strong. - I can't do it. - Yeah, you can. I knew it, I knew it, I had a feeling and I told you, I said not this time, not this deployment. Stop, stop, Come here, come here. You can't leave me. Stop it, you've gotta be strong for all three of us. You've got too. Hey bro, check out Father Time, trying to be fancy over here. Get out of the ring before you get hurt. - We got a Mike Tyson here, huh? - Yeah, you're the champ, don't waste any of your time with this old man. Yo, he might be ugly, but he aint stupid. Hey, hey, I'm talking to you. Yo, I'm talking to you, you're not listening to me now. Old man, you washed up old man. Don't you know who I am, huh? - Oh! - Who was that? - You, come here. Get up, Chulo. - That didn't happen, okay. It just happened, man. Hey, listen to me, that didn't happen. Let me see your phone. - Get it now? - Got it. - Take a walk, good night. - Hit the road, Jack. You kidding me with this? Get him up, get him out of here before somebody sees us. So, can we talk? I've been thinking about what you said and I changed my mind, I wanna train you, Bear. It'll be like old times, only better. I know you heard me, I said I wanna train you. Nah, I changed my mind too. There's a huge underground fight, it's called the Basement, single elimination event, winner takes all, big cash prize, ever heard of it? I know you wanna fight in it, Bear, I can get you in. I know you heard me, I said I can get you in, and it won't be easy, by the way. You know you got some nerve, Father Teresa. First you turn Skylar against me, then you don't wanna train me. Now you see an opportunity for yourself, and now you wanna train me. Hey look you wanna fight the Basement, I'll train you, we'll split the purse 80/20, not negotiable. I train by my rules, and we train with who, what and how I wanna train you, no exceptions. The game has changed out there, little buddy, now you surprised Chulo, but I don't think that'll happen again. And that punk Darwin, he's been suspended, so he'll be going underground, he'll be fighting in the Basement. What do you say, pal? Nah, I'm not interested. Rule number one, you've gotta drop that monkey that's been sucking the life out of you. And I knew you tuned up those cops, half the APD works out here, and in 30 minutes I want everything I don't want you using on my desk. If not, deals off. And I'm gonna screen you too, I'm gonna drug test you once a week. If you pop up positive, you're done, pal. 30 minutes. ♪ When I go I'm never coming back ♪ ♪ When I go I'm never coming back ♪ ♪ When I go I'm never coming back ♪ ♪ When I go I'm never coming back ♪ ♪ When I go I'm never coming back ♪ ♪ When I go I'm never coming back ♪ ♪ When I go Red, William.

Well, if that's nothing, you might want to consider starting a career as a fighter. You'd give those girls a run for their money. I don't think so. Hey, um, I'll see you at home, okay. Sounds good. Alrighty, here we go. - What's he doing here? - He's part of the deal and you already agreed to it. - We need Red to help us win. - Are you out of your mind? For what it's worth, Skylar said you guys were through. Stop talking. Look, pal, I know a lot of things are eating away at you. When I came back from Nam, I had to make some adjustments too. Things don't have to be this way, pal. Just training, that's it. Just training, that's it. Warm up five minutes with the rope, then grappling, then circuits of the weights, cardio, lots of cardio. Lots and lots and lots of cardio. You've got this, Bear. What's up, big boy? - How you're doing, Micah? - Alright. Alright, put your... put your feet apart like mine, there we go, alright come on, give me some. Whoa, whoa. How's school? You studying hard, how's your mom? - Good. - You taking care of her? Put your hands up like this, like this. Alright, lean over, lean your head in, now go. Whoa, that's pretty good, alright square up. Alright. Micah, come here. Take care of your mom. No time for an old friend? Why you been fighting, Bear? You got a death wish, or a miracle up your sleeve 'cause Darwin can't be beat. Had to fire him from my crew, man. He's crazy. He beat up some of the girls, ruined some of them for life, he ends careers. You're too good to talk to me now? Listen, if you're still mad about Skylar, you need to drop that, man. Her and Red's been friendly for a long time, and I mean really friendly. Now I know Coach Bronx kept you around 'cause he needed you for his big payday, but you and Skylar were never gonna happen. I mean you had to know that, right? What do you want? Hey, you know the drill. I might need a little favor. We'll be in touch. Micah, take a break. I'm running out, I don't mind picking you something up. - No, thanks. - I haven't seen you eat all day. I'll, uh, leave my number on the counter in case you change your mind. Here are the pictures, congratulations you two. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. Yeah. I need you now. Please. Let me stay here so I can be a good father to this child. Please. Lift those knees, lift those knees, there you go. Push it. Push it. Come on. Can you excuse us for a minute, Drill Instructor Sergeant Nurse London ma'am? Okay, we'll take a break, but it's gonna cost you. What are you doing here? Just came to check on you. Well, here I am. Cowboy, I'm trying to make things right. Well, I'm trying to make things right too. I'm fighting for this little one, so he can have a dad. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Alright, now you see, I'm right where you put me. You always had to push it, you always had to go that extra mile, you always had to take another shot. - We're done here? - Yeah, we're done here.

He did it, he did it, Bear won. - He did it, he did it. - Ah, who did fall? He did it. Take him down, What are you doing, man. Crush. Stop, let him up, let him up. Tell Bear, I'm coming for him, and when I'm done with him not even the Boy Scouts will want him. Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo. Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo, Chulo Get the fuck out of here. You think your better than my Ain't nobody better than me. Fetch! Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing you. I just thought I'd come out here and say congratulations and I was hoping I could take you out to celebrate. I mean if you're hungry and don't mind the company. Micah's with my mom, so it would just be us. - I can't, Summer. - Yeah, I don't want to disturb the tournament. I just thought maybe you needed to relax. - Eh. - No worries. Um, maybe after the tournament we could hang out. I mean Micah has really taken a liking to you, - and I don't know... - Summer, you don't want this, trust me. Just tell me you're not interested, Bear. I'm a big girl, I can take it. Cody, listen, uh, you're gonna take a tumble in the first round, okay? You're gonna go down, I'm gonna make a lot of dough, but most importantly is you and I will be square, you got it? That's not gonna happen. Okay, alright I'll tell you what, I'll cut you in, 20%. Hey, I'm patriotic, you big jarhead. Now you listen to me Coach Bronx is into me for several G's, you got it? He came to me to get you in on this deal. Hey, hey, first round. Hi, who you calling? - The cops. - Yeah, alright, tell them I said hello. First round, remember that or we'll make sure you never forget it. Alright, Bear give them a good show. You both have been here before, we will have a clean fight, protect yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, back up to your corners, we'll fight on my signal. Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's fight! You're a dead man. That guy can't take a hint. Hey, Bronx, I lost 'cause of your boy Bear. Uhm. Now he's got some heat on him, but you're gonna set it straight. No, that would be your problem, since your the idiot who bet against him. Actually it's your problem, because his debt is your debt. That's not the way that works, that's between you and Bear. I got nothing to do with it. See, Bear owes me and you owe Bear, so I'm gonna collect from you, that's how this accounting works. I owe Bear nothing. Are you crazy, or are you going senile. - You owe him everything. - I don't owe you or Bear a thing, now what you guys gonna do, gonna cut off my legs? I don't think so. Is he serious? You, you really don't know, do you? Know what? Hey, hey, interrupting a transaction here. - As requested. - Thank you so much. - Don't mention it. - I owe you one. - You've got about ten minutes. - Okay thanks, pal. Hydrate. Let's get ready to go. Alright, give me your back. Let's go. Oh, Bear, hey, Come on man. Gonna get a cheap shot, it's not happening again. Look at me, hey, look at me. That's enough, that's enough, back in your corner. Stay in your corner. Take off your jacket. Let me see your hands. Your head. Put your arms out. Oh man, what's up, what's up, grandpa? - Are you ready? - Back up for me, back up. You ready? Let's go. Bring it in, guys. Gentlemen, welcome to the semi-finals. Touch gloves, back up to your corners. Breath for me, deep breaths. Bear, wake up, wake up, buddy. Wake up. Wake up, buddy. Why didn't you tell me? I mean did you really believe that I wouldn't find out? You cost me my future, Skylar's future. Get on line, Marine. Get your hands up. Oh, I ought to tear you apart from your eyebrows to your toenails. You think I'm a fool? How dare you come into my gym after all you've done? You didn't think I could handle it, did you? You think I'm a weak old man, I'll show you weak old man. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me you threw the title fight to protect us from Scorch. You didn't have to throw the fight for us. We could have won. We would have won. Yeah, you protected us, but I can't fix this thing, Bear. Bells rung and you can't unrung it, the fights over. Oh thank you. Oh, oh, Bear. Hey, bud. Hey, is your mom gonna lock up? - Yeah. - Awesome, I'll see you tomorrow, okay then. See you. Micah, where's your mom? She's in the back, she doesn't feel very well. - She doesn't feel well? - No. Summer. Summer, come on. Summer, wake up. Summer, come on. Bear? No, go, get out of here, no, go. Three years of fighting this every day, gone. And look at what I did to Micah. - Oh God. - Shh. What kind of mom am I? Shh. It's my past, right? Maybe if I wasn't a young mom... Then would you give me a chance? Summer, listen, there's something you need to know. Shh. Hang in there, hang in there. I'm just gonna give her a little Phenerganfor the nausea. - You okay, buddy? - Yeah, I'm okay, is my mom gonna be okay? Yes. But I need you to take care of her from now on, okay? Okay, I can do that. I know you can. These are for me? Yes, listen, - I need you to be tough like a Marine, got it? - Got it. Alright. Pappy, pappy, wake up. Pappy. Bear lost. Pappy, Chris, Chris, wake up. Chris, this isn't funny, wake up. Pappy wake up. I need a nurse! Alright, let's see what we have going on here. He's not waking up. He's fallen into a toxin induced coma. - What does that mean? - His liver is starting to fail, okay? His vitals, they're actually not as bad as I expected. Uh, get transport to get him to the 3rd floor now. Right away. He's in a coma. - Just don't, don't. - I'm sorry. I uh, I'm sorry, Mia. Yeah. What? I'm back in the fight? They mickey'ed my drink? You cannot do this. I beg you, don't do this. Bear, you can't pretend to me, little buddy. You're hurt and bad. Even at your best, your very best, you're an underdog with this guy, he's a killer. I won't be a part of this, I will not be a part of this. If you walk into that ring, if you walk into that ring you're not walking out the same, do you understand? That guilt gets trapped in the soul, doesn't it? It's hard to keep from choking on it, it's just itching to come out. Guilt? You're talking crazy, Bear. - Just let it out, Bronx. - You got a lot of nerve,. What do you got to say? Spit it out, tough guy. - Red told me. - Red told you what? Somebody mickey'ed my drink for the Chulo fight. Why'd you do it? What mickey your drink? I didn't mickey your drink. I mean, you got hit in the head one too many times. I just wanna know why? Why what? Why I mickey'ed your drink? I didn't mickey your drink. Why would you say that? How much did he pay you? Pay me, you crazy, who? - Why'd you do it then? - I didn't do it, I had nothing to do with it. You're lying. It was the only way to protect you, Bear. You're like my kid. You can't win this one, Bear. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restored my soul, he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff thy comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me, in presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. You do that again and you're done. Stay in your corner, stay in your corner. Come on ref, that's what they here for. Alright, listen up, Jim this round we're gonna start off punishing his legs, taking them to the ground, go for the submission. I don't care if he taps out, you don't stop. Put him away, and put him away now, let's go. Round two, gentlemen. Come on. Americana, push the Americana, let's go, fight the fight. Break it, break it now, finish it. Break that arm. Stop, up! Fight's over, you're finished. Come on, Bear. I gotta stop this fight, you're finished. You stop this fight, I'll kill you. This ones on you, Bear. Woe is me, for I am in peace in my last day on Earth from here. I will lift up mine eyes to the hills from whence cometh my help. Okay, God, I'm through fighting. Help me. Bear, listen, we've got one shot and one shot only. Switch to southpaw stance, that'll put your weak leg in front, that's the bait, and Darwin won't resist it. Block his kick and give him a shot to the chin with everything you've got. That's gonna stun him, then you choke him out. Bear, if you don't land that punch, we lose. ♪ On and on ♪ Thinking about the way You stained my heart ♪ ♪ Just allow it To be torn apart ♪ ♪ On and on and on ♪ We're playing hide and seek ♪ Feel your poison Flowing over me ♪ ♪ On and on and on and on ♪ While you're hiding ♪ I'm here dying ♪ Sometimes that's Just the way it goes ♪ ♪ That's just the way it goes ♪ When you're fighting ♪ I can't take it ♪ Sometimes that's Just the way it goes ♪ - Thank you God. - ♪ That's just the way it goes We don't always know where this journey we call life is going to take us, do we? One of the greatest gifts that God gave us in this life is friendship, love and friendship. The two are inseparable. Jesus lead by example. He died willingly as our savior to pay for our wrongs, but he was and is our greatest friend. Jesus said there is no greater love then when one lays down his life for his friend. I'm reminded of that old hymn, what a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear. And so dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of one of our most precious friends. We will greatly miss you Staff Sergeant Cody Bear Blackbear. Bear was a warrior, a man of war, who was at times at war with everyone, including himself. Yet Cody was that friend who in the end gave everything. When he was captured, he was poisoned with toxins by his captors, but chose to suffer in silence telling no one. Cody had a choice, he could either have saved himself or another. His last mission was to fight to save Christopher Cowboy Parker. Knowing it would cost him his life. The Marines motto is Semper Fidelis, which in Latin means Always Faithful. So today we recognize the perfect example of Always Faithful in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Today we also recognize an imperfect example, the example of Staff Sergeant Cody Blackbear. Godspeed, Bear, Semper Fidelis. On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States Marine Corps and a grateful nation please accept this flag as a token of our appreciation of your loved ones faithful and honorable service to country and corps. ♪ Yeah, sometimes all you Gotta do is just trust ♪ ♪ Let's go, let's go, Yeah, people don't know What I've been through ♪ ♪ People don't know what I feel The fact that I'm back on This mic is making me sick ♪ ♪ Another rapper who won't Swallow the pill, Munchausen, I wanna be ill ♪ ♪ Turn up the music and Send me the hospital bill ♪ ♪ I rather do this, be me Forget everyone ♪ ♪ I just wanna be real, yeah See I stepped in the ring ♪ ♪ I stepped in the ring, gloves On, fist out took the hits boy, Took the hits for ♪ ♪ The ones that I love Now I'm down on the ground, Body bruised ♪ ♪ Eyes closed, blood flows Blinded by lights and The roar of the crowd ♪ ♪ My deamon stand over me now Yeah, I flash back to my worst days ♪ ♪ With my worst pain Full of mistakes ♪ ♪ Full of myself These days I'm with Hades ♪ ♪ Facing blue flames in The form of my true shame Full of disgrace ♪ ♪ where's your grace, Where's your face I swear to God these are my last days ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm outside of the Gate I feel so untouchable ♪ ♪ I feel so ashamed, a leopard Who knows his miserable fate ♪ ♪ With no faith I'm a man Blinded by my rage ♪ ♪ By my hate, God I ask Again, where's your love ♪ ♪ Where's your grace, All I see is pain, yeah ♪ ♪ I see you Lord Against the storm ♪ ♪ My mind is jarred But the light is gone ♪ ♪ With my battle scars, My shattered heart ♪ ♪ And all I hear Are empty words ♪ ♪ My mind is torn But we are known ♪ ♪ Rumors lost In the winds roar ♪ ♪ The precious words That can save my soul ♪ ♪ But all I hear Are empty words ♪ ♪ And if you hear me I just Wish that you would know ♪ ♪ That I don't have a plan I don't understand ♪ ♪ Think I can't get up again All I know ♪ ♪ Is that I'm not enough All I know is that I fell time and time again ♪ ♪ Time and time again, every Motion just flood in like Violent waves on the ocean ♪ ♪ That run dark with my scent Blood water, My hands they run red ♪ ♪ Once again, what have I done I see the bodies Float in the stream ♪ ♪ I scream God, please help me I've been losing it lately I've been feeling so crazy ♪ ♪ Bible inside of a drawer I never read it anymore ♪ ♪ Every prayer locked away, Inside the darkest doors ♪ ♪ But I give you all the keys And I'll give you all of me ♪ ♪ Yeah, just break This prison that I'm Able my own words from me ♪ ♪ I mean I'm my own worst enemy God give me mercy, mercy ♪ ♪ Look me in the face, face and Tell me that someone like me ♪ ♪ Really gets all that grace ♪ God give me mercy, mercy ♪ Look me in the face, face ♪ And tell me That someone like me ♪ ♪ Really gets all that grace ♪ I see you, Lord Against the storm ♪ ♪ I'm under stars But the light is gone ♪ ♪ With my battle scars My shattered heart ♪ ♪ And all I hear Are empty words ♪ ♪ My mind is torn By the unknown ♪ ♪ Rumors lost In the winds roar ♪ ♪ Precious words That can save my soul ♪ ♪ But all I hear Are empty words ♪ ♪ Now I see you, Lord Against the storm ♪ ♪ I'm under stars But the light is gone ♪ ♪ Battle scars, My shattered heart ♪ ♪ And all I hear Are empty words ♪ ♪ My mind is torn By the unknown ♪ ♪ Rumors lost In the winds roar ♪ ♪ Precious words That can save my soul ♪ ♪ But all I hear Are empty words ♪
