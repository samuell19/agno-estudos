Steven is getting married in a couple of hours, I don't know what the hell we're doing talking about hunting a last time before the Army. The whole thing, it's crazy. I'll tell you one thing. If I found out my life had to end up in the mountains, it'd be all right. But it has to be in your mind. What? One shot? Two is pussy. I don't think about one shot that much any more, Mike. You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that, they don't listen. You really think about Vietnam? Yeah. I don't know. I guess I'm thinking about the deer. Going to Nam. I like the trees, you know? I like the way the trees are in the mountains, it's all different. The way the trees are. I sound like some asshole, right? I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy I go hunting with, you know? I like a guy with quick moves and speed. I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes. Who's an asshole? Who do you think's an asshole? They're all a bunch of assholes. I mean, I love them. They're great guys. But, you know, without you, I'd hunt alone. Seriously, that's what I'd do. But you're a fucking nut. You know that, Mike? You're a maniac. Control freak. I just don't like no surprises. Damn thing won't open. Well, give it a kick! Hey, hey, not like that, not like that.

Don't say no. When a man say no to champagne, he say no to life. You saw this before? Up north. Oh, yes, of course. I gotta go. But you must come in. I insist. What is there to be afraid of after this war? War is a joke. A silly thing. I'm going home, ace. Naturellement, I pay my players. Cash. American. However, should you prefer German marks, or perhaps Swiss francs, that, of course, can be arranged. I can arrange everything. You got the wrong guy, ace. But you must come in. No, don't do that. But, I insist. Nick! Hey, Nick! Hey, Nick! Listen, if you are really brave and lucky, I can make you very, very rich. Wow, would you look at that? Just keep goin'. Just keep goin'. You said Logan Street though, man. I just wanna keep goin'. The trailer was right there. Wait till Michael gets here, huh? This is it. This is Michael. Oh. All right, everybody, stay where you are. Stay right there. I'll go get him. I'll go get him. Everybody stay here. Three cheers for the red, white, and blue! Hip, hip, hurray! Hip, hip, hurray! Hip, hip, hurray! That cab ain't stopping. What's going on? I can't wait for him to see all this. What happened? Hey, Stosh, what happened? I thought it was him. So, his plane could be late! Take it easy will you, Axel? You're driving everyone nuts. You okay? I know Nick will be back soon. I know Nick. He'll be coming back, too. Right, Axel? Fucking A. Go straight on down to the highway. It's your bread, man. Hey, wait! It's open! It's... Michael. Oh, Michael. Oh. Oh, Michael. Oh, Michael. Oh, Mich- Oh, gee. Gee, you look beautiful. Oh, yeah. Let me take your coat. Boy, everybody was here. You missed them all. Oh. They're gonna be so mad when they find out they missed you. Welcome home. You know, I was hopin'- I was hopin' somehow, Michael, maybe you had Nick with you. No. No. Did you hear anything on Nick? No. Nothing. He's AWOL. That's all we know. He'll be back. He never wrote to me. He never called me. Well, maybe you were out. Yeah, maybe. So how are you, anyway? I'm fine, okay. How are you? Uh, me? I'm okay. I'm fine. I go along, you know. Still working at the market. There's a million things to do. Y- You sure you're all right, huh? Yeah, I'm all right. What about your wounds? There's nothing. Just the usual complications, that's all. We heard- No, that's not true. A lot of guys go through it. Mmm. I made Nick that sweater. I couldn't remember the exact size, but I think he's about the same size as you, huh? No, too big. Oops. Well, I could fix that, though. I mean, one thing about wool, it's really a cinch... to fix. Oh, Christ! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. How's your job? Great. Fine, yeah. Once or twice we almost had to close. I gotta go to work now. You gotta go now? Yes. Uh, would you mind if I walked you to work? Mikey, you're so... weird. You're always such a gentleman. It's cold out there. Yeah. I'm not used to it. Oh, I'm so glad you're alive. I'm so happy. I really don't know what I feel. Hello, hi, Mike. Linda, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about Nick. And how... I know how much you loved him, and I know that it'll never be the same. I just wanted to tell you that. Maybe... I don't know. Maybe you don't want to talk about it. How's it going, Hot Lips? Yeah, no kidding. He's a real tough guy. It's okay. Why don't you come in with me? Just say hello. Come on. Oh, Mike, please. Just say hello. They want to see you, I know. Yeah, just for a second, okay? Okay. Hey, look who's here? It's Michael! Look who's here. Hey, everybody. Oh, Michael, I read about you in the paper. Oh, Michael. Oh, Michael. Oh, dear. Doesn't he look terrific? What a nice coat you have. Hi, Michael. Mike.

Oh, Michael. Oh, Helen, come on. Janie, leave me alone. We really won over there, huh, Mike? We won. I have to go to work now. Good seein' you, Mike. See you, Michael. Come see us, Michael. Can I see you later? Okay. After work? Yeah. Where? Where. At home? At home? Okay. One beer at John's. One beer. What? Come on, I'll buy you a beer. All right, just one. Hey, Axel! Hey, Stosh! Hey, Axel. Hey! Hey! He-hey! Look at this! How you doing? Mikey! Hey, man, how are you doing? All right. Hey, where was you? Where was you? What do you mean, where was I? Where were you?

Yeah, it looks... Come on, we're going to John's. So, how have you guys been? Hanging in there. You know? How does it feel to be shot? It don't. Mmm. It don't hurt, if that's what you want to know. How you been? Been okay? Yeah. Yeah. Same old thing, you know? Nothing's changed. I'm getting more ass than a toilet seat and Axel here, he's getting fatter than ever. Hey, Stan, why don't you show him that gun? Shh. Take it easy. That little pussy thing you carry around, look at that. Watch it. What's that for? Same thing the other one was for. And what was that for? He's a worrier. Ah, forget it. Come on, let's go have a drink. Yeah, let's get a drink. Hey, Boom-Boom! Look what I found! Hey, Michael! Never seen somebody... Let this man through. A little room! How you doing, Mike? What's up, buddy? "But she never complains of the fast times and the bad things he's done" Come on, come on, in the back, in the back. Get in the back. Come on. "She just talks about the good times they've had" "and all the good times to come" Hey, what's going on here? Stosh, get the glasses on the sink. Which ones, the dirty ones? Yeah, use the dirty ones. Phew, no shit. Shit, what did you do? Win the war all by yourself? Look at this stuff here. No help from you. Here we go! Misha... To you, Mike. To everybody. Fucking A. Hey, hey, wait, wait! To Nick and Steve. Mmm, mmm. To Nick and Steve. "He likes the bright lights, the night life" You look great. How's Angela? "Lord knows, she don't understand him" "She does the best that she can" Not so good, Mike. Worse since, uh, she talked to him. Talked to who? To Steven. She talked to Steve? I didn't know he was back. Oh, you didn't know he's back? Oh, Jesus. No, I didn't know he was back. Is he back? You didn't, you didn't... Where is he? Where is he? Okay, hey, John, come on. Come on, John. Where is he? Just answer me. Where is he? Mike, I don't know. I don't know where he is. Just tell me where he is. I don't know where he is, Mike. Angela wouldn't tell us. Angela wouldn't tell us. She wouldn't talk to anybody. Is that true? Yeah. Boom! Angela, I heard Steven was alive. Where is he? Where is Steven? Where is he? Just tell me where he is. Angela, where is Steven? Just tell me where he is. Where is he? Where is he? Please, you gotta tell me. Now where is he? Do you know? Where is he? Take care. Michael. Right here. What are you doing? Nothing. Just got my gear, and I was gonna go. What? I was just gonna go. No, don't go. I have, uh, all this food. I'll make you a nice sit-down dinner. No, I can't. Mikey. Why don't we go to bed? C- Can't we just comfort each other? No, I can't. Not here. I gotta get out of here. Sorry, I just gotta get out. I'm... I'll be... Look, I don't know... I feel a lot of distance, and I feel far away. I'll see you later. Feels kind of weird, coming to a motel. You know what I mean, Michael? Mike? I gotta put my can down for this one. "Here we are" "staring at each other" "with that crazy look" "in our eyes" Michael, it's on the house. No, thanks, man. "It happens every time we get together" "Did we ever really say goodbye?" How you feeling? You okay? I'm feelin' okay. I'm fine. You sure? Yeah. "...our eyes keep looking at each other" "They're talking over places that we've been" Yeah! What do you think of her, Mike? I don't know. Huh, no? Come on, on the level. I don't know, Stosh. Is she-is she beautiful? "And everybody knows" Is she beautiful? Is she? "Tattletale eyes" The truth? Yeah! Nope. No. No. Well, do you think she's intelligent? No. Neither do I. "Tattletale eyes told on our minds" I don't think she's intelligent either. Then what the hell do you see in her? I don't know. That's what... I came over to ask you. Maybe she's good in bed. Why don't you ask her? "Tattletale eyes" "Told on our minds" "Oh, it's somethin'" "How they read between the lines" "Tattletale eyes" "Told on our minds" Oh, where the fuck is my fucking ball? Goddamn pinsetter. "...keep a thing from tattletale eyes" Where is he going? What's he doing? Axel! Axel! "...you can't keep a thing from tattletale eyes" Michael! What the hell happened? The pinsetter came down on him. Stan, get the jack out of my trunk. Nothing works around this damn place anymore. Come on, Axel. We're gettin' you clear, here. Watch your - Watch your elbow, there.
