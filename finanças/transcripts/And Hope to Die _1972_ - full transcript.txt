Darling... go and play, make yourself a friend. We are but older children, dear, who fret to find bedtime near. Antoine Cardot. Our brothers in New York were clumsy, Tony. The long road ends here. Look, I'm not a pilot, I'm just a book seller. It was an accident, it was proved in court. We have our own courts, Tony. Come on, be brave. Don't make me do it here! No, you won't be needing those. Are you a doctor? No. You're always trying to be smarter than everybody else? Dubargin's dead... Do you hear me? Dubargin's committed suicide. Easy... let me help you. No, God, no... My wallet... in my pocket. Open the envelope. Take it! Buy yourself a good time! Stop! Come down, and make it fast. I didn't take it, he gave it to me. You're mistaken, I didn't kill him. He didn't kill him. Save the explanations for later, come on! It's better like that! You are not the police? What's he saying? He wants me to choke him. Not before Charley sees him. Out! Paul, Paul! Help him, come on! Leave me alone! No... It's Charley who decides. Come on. Paul! Leave me alone. Plenty of ducks here. This time I'll be chasing ducks. A little Frenchman, aren't you... Plenty of ducks... We got Renner... Who's that? A witness. Charley won't be happy! Come on, you're not gonna die. Ten bucks says I am. I've got him. Who is he? Someone about to die. Well... can he have a coffee first? What happened to Paul? Hey, she's talking to ya! What happened to Paul? He stepped out of a moving car. You are Charley? This opens what? My room. Where is your room? In Paris. Where in Paris? Rue Notre-Dame des Champs. Charley knows Paris. No. I'm going to see Paul. Where is the money? What money? Did Renner give you this empty wallet? Who is Renner? Let me have him, Charley. No, he's got our piggy bank. Just a little tap! I said no! What were you doing in that balloon? Dreaming I was somewhere else. Is that here? Did the cops follow you? We didn't see any cops, we just heard the sirens. You, keep an eye on him! A moral dilemma: Is it OK to beat the prisoner? Charley already answered you. Right! What did Charley say? You got a sweet little face. I bet the ladies like it! That's not fair! Where is Charley's money? You're pushing your luck, Froggy. What's that mean, Froggy? Means you eat frogs. That's how we call Frenchmen here. I told you to leave him alone. He started it! That's not true! He was a good heavyweight once. What's up outside? Pepper, running up some food. I'm hungry. How do you like this guy? My name is Sugar. It's good, eh? I've had 4 husbands, and they all loved to eat. Do you still have the fourth? I don't know... Last time I saw him I poked his left jaw with a silver mirror. No... the right. Is that why they call you Sugar? O no, it's because of my pies. The big brute... is Matonne. And the guy who brought you here is Rizzio. And you? Froggy. When did you get to Montreal? This morning. Who's after you? No one... Come on, Charley told me. Charley's never wrong. The police. What for? A holdup. That's hardly a reason to come all this way. I killed a cop. Charley! That's Paul's. That's Renner's. Everybody's got a right to his arms! You'll have one when you want to kill yourself. Arms first. Tell him, Froggy. I was saying that I killed a cop. In France, during a holdup. Him, a holdup? He's lying. We need to get rid of him right away. We're listening. I took a freight ship. Yesterday I was in New York, but the police spotted me. He's lying! I jumped on a train for Montreal, but the police were waiting for me, here too. That's a lie! They even fired a few shots. Rizzio, give me a cigarette. Take out the handcuffs. That's all I can do for you, Froggy. On the other side of the island there's a bridge. 2 miles after the bridge you find the main road. Good luck. I can go... just like that? Why not? You're one of us. You're cool, Froggy. Not like him, you give him 10 bucks he wouldn't come back. If somebody can explain why he came back... it's not wasted money. He came back because he likes my pie. Perhaps he saw me following him. I believe what he says, he simply needs to hide. My money, Froggy? My 15,000 dollar. If you don't know where it is, you were wrong coming back, Froggy. I know where it is, but I'd like to put myself in your place. Conclusion? As long as I won't say anything, you won't do anything. I'm too valuable. You're bluffing. You don't know anything. 500 dollar bills, brand new, in 3 wads, their paper bands still on. There are ways to make you talk! Right. Try. Put these back on him. My grandpa, in Michigan He would press his weekly pay with an iron. It was me who put the embers. One thing you forgot, Froggy. I got all the time in the world. I don't need that money right away. It'll be a lot longer for you than for me. He's gonna stay here? The 10 bucks he lost, that pays for his room. Where will he sleep? There are no more beds. There's the iron bed in the barn. But that's a kid's bed. For 10 bucks he can't expect the Ritz. In Paris, Charley slept at the Ritz for nothing! If the cooking is what I think it is, it'll be fine. You know something, I like him more and more! Me, I don't like him! I don't like you either. It's been 10 years I don't like you. Go and look in the canoe. If the money's not there, go look at the pier. Like I'm to go after nothing. He knows it already! He must be having a good laugh inside! Make an effort, little one. Charlie... Yes. Listen. I have to find that money back. To pay for equipment, you understand? Thanks to Renner Charley, I'm not afraid. Paul. Charley. Charley's right, he'll never make it back. I carved those myself. That's worth a fortune to a collector. Hear that, Charley? Rizzio is an artist. He also paints. OK, I'll go there. You are cool, Froggy. First Sugar, then Rizzio, you are fast. It's a beautiful view from this room. Which part of the landscape do you like best? Over there, by the bench. OK. If by tomorrow morning you haven't given back my marbles, that's where we dig your grave. In this famous exposition dome the body was found. Julius Renner, 48, was a guard at the theatre at the Place des Arcs. He must have been killed by a burglar. We can only lament the rise in crime in our city over the last 10 years. It might be settling of scores, the investigation will tell. End of the news alert. Renner learned the hard way, you should never trust a cop. An ex-cop. Makes no difference. Instead of doing the job with us he goes off with the money. Which job? Did you ask something? He doesn't need to know. Nono, why do you speak. Listen Charley, it's not my fault if I didn't find the money! I've searched everywhere! It's good, right? Well I think it's pretty good. Evening Pepper! She's Paul's sister. Meet Froggy, Pepper. She takes her name too seriously, don't pay attention to her. You'd better pay attention! She's got a gun. She's got a gun so she can hunt. When she finds out who touched her big brother, then we'll find out what she hunts. I'll roast it for dinner tomorrow, with mushrooms. He's not going to die, is he? Of course not. He needs a doctor. You know we can't. We used to have our own doctor. That used to be, Pepper. Who did this? Renner. And Renner is dead. How about a game of gin rummy? 2 cents a point. You want to play with them or with us, Froggy? 25 dollars for my watch, Rizzio. It's not working! Nothing ever works with the French, except having kids. I read that in a book once. You already have a watch! I'll give you $20, for the sake of bargaining. 20 plus 3 cigarettes... for the sake of bargaining. I bet you my $20 Charley. If you can do that, you win. Froggy must have a steady hand to pull off a trick like that. It could be useful. I'll deduct it from what you owe me. You don't love me, Charley! I'm always on the receiving end. What has he done? Nothing Sugar, just watching you taking a bath that's all. Get up! It's no big deal. And if he plays havoc with the operation, that's no big deal? We need professionals, and he? He's got nothing in there! A public danger. You, learn and lose the door. What do you want? I don't have any clean clothes. And did you decide to give back my marbles? No. So what. In 1 hour you'll be dead. I want to die properly. Look at Paul's stuff. You can take what fits you. When you stayed at the Ritz, was that during the war? One can't hide a thing from you, Froggy. September '44. What did you do in the army? Tourist. And as a civilian? Thief. I've always had the same trade. Who is that? A mare from your country. Her name was Jelly Nut. She is dead now. Here, I've never used it. Soon I'll be living in Paris. And I'll buy all the descendants of Jelly Nut for sale. You'll need a lot of money. I'll have all the money I need. Charley, why Paris? Because every day that God gives there is a race. Look here, the great lady! We'd need to make some rules for the bathroom. He was inside for a billion years! Would you like eggs? A dozen! I'm hungry! The question is how to kill him. Do we get him to talk first? Obviously. Not bad. Paul! Paul, we have to go back right now! Pepper, open up! Charley, Paul is dead! Charley, do you hear me? Open up! Nobody comes in, Charley. I'm not giving back my brother until I get a priest. You hear me Charley? I want a priest. What are you talking about, open the door! I want a burial, I want a priest! First Renner, and now Paul. Yes, we're off to a good start. Who will go up to the bedroom? He will. Why me? 'Cause we're going to dig a hole, it's up to you to decide who goes in it. Does she have a lot of ammunition? An arsenal. If Pepper wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead. You should walk right in. I want a priest, and prayers. We can't call a priest. You know, he was 4 years older, but I was always looking after him. Who looked after you, Pepper? Charley. Charley is a good and magnificent man. Once, when I was at the orphanage with Paul, he came to get us both in the middle of the night. He smuggled me out in blanket, He took us to New Orleans and we lived a magnificent life. Before he died, my dad was in prison with Charley. We'll say a prayer Pepper, I promise you. A real prayer? Yes. They're digging a hole near the bench. They have to dig under the trees. My brother liked to be under the trees. I want what I was promised. A prayer, and under the trees. Froggy, you can have until sunset to tell me where my money is. Who is gonna say the prayer? Sugar. A woman can't be the priest. Matonne then. I don't know no prayers. There's nothing in my head. Rizzio will say it. Cannot, it's not his religion. And Froggy neither, he's not one of us. Then we don't bury my brother. Charley... I never remember it. Besides, it got nothing to do with a burial. If it's a prayer, it's a prayer. Now lay me down to sleep I pray the lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord to take, good night. I bet Paul $ 10 he wouldn't die. Keep it, you did the digging. If I pay it's like a real burial. So, spying, are we? It's a fire engine. What for? You never know when a fire starts. I made rose pie. A what? With rose jelly, The flowers... it's pretty good. Where are the others? Montreal. Are you guarding me? Mmm, I even have a rifle. This place belongs to you, Sugar? And you belong to Charley? When he thinks about it We know each other for 15 years. Of those 15 years, 10 he was in prison. I saw him Thursdays, behind a grill. And otherwise, it was between 2 jobs, when he came to hide. And for me, between 2 divorces. And now, will he take you to Paris? The only way Charley can live is alone. And you? Me? Exactly the opposite. And Charley isn't jealous? It's good, huh? We ought to change that bandage. Knock out... Yes! There's somebody above your head. What? I am a medium. Wait! Come, don't be stupid, come! Listen here, that won't do. She is a medium! With the money you're gonna make you can take dozens. Plenty of mediums! Charley will kill you. You said that he's not jealous. That's not the point, Tony. It's not a bullet that'll kill you, it's a knife stab. You're not obliged to tell Charley. The gun... You scared me. Not enough. I've knew somebody once who let his gun be taken... He didn't have time to be scared. The sun is setting, Froggy. Are you winning? No, you're taking my queen. You weren't playing all afternoon, what were you doing? Thinking. Conclusion? Renner, and then Paul. That means you shot 2 men. I'll tell you where your money is. Because now you have a better reason to hold on to me. But take these off. If you can tell me where my money is, you have my word. It's in Paul's coat. Yesterday, when you brought me here, I didn't want those bills found in my pocket. So I put them in his. What coat? The one he is buried in. We got to dig him up? He's gonna do the shoveling! You promised... now take these off. Pepper found these when she dressed her brother. And you didn't do anything? Maybe I came to the same conclusion, Froggy. What's yours? Suppose you'd cut me in on the job you're planning. I'd have enough to go to Vancouver, then to Australia! It's full of kangaroos down there, they'll box the hell outta you! Tony, go and do some painting with Rizzio. OK Charley. Your room in Paris, you still got it? Yes. I'll play you for it. Against what? I'll tell you what you did this afternoon. If I'm wrong, you keep the room. First, you had a rose pie. I think it's lousy, but to each his own. Second, you came up here with Sugar. I think that's lousy. But she has the right to do what she wants to... You come back every time, don't you Froggy? I went to Australia during the war. I think it's lousy, but hell, it's your life, not mine. There's something else Charley. Sugar changed my bandage. It wasn't a bullet, it was a knife. From a New York cop? We fought, it was my knife. Why do you tell me this? So everything will be clear. Shut that door. You have 6 bullets, you fire 5. If this key ring is still hanging, I'll put the last one in your head. Is that clear? Just one left... You're gonna miss! Go ahead, shoot. A real pro knows you always leave an empty chamber in a revolver. Rizzio didn't move, he knows. He tried to kill me, he pulled the trigger! Correct. He chalked up a point. Besides, he doesn't shoot so bad. Charley, is it "to wake over my soul"? Yes. What are you doing? I'm composing a prayer for Charley. What's the use of that? That's for Christians. That's not written in it, it says God, that's all. If it says God it's Christian. But that's not in there! But there's only one God! Right. So why do you write that? Because mine is God. 10 dollars says it's another. Accepted. Where's the mustard? In the kitchen. Pepper, get it for me. Pepper, I'm talking to you! I'm going. You stay there, I asked her! It's always the same with her, do you hear me, get me the mustard! Hey, did you see what she did, did you see? Imported silk shirt, did you see? Enough, water and bath salt. It's not my fault her brother's dead, it was him who hung him from the car. Enough now. It was him who hung him, not me! Not true! Get your care elsewhere! What did I do to you, Sugar? Lie, Matonne. A 23 dollar shirt... Froggy, was he the one who got care this afternoon? So, what was it? What? His wound. I'm waiting. I cannot, Charley, I can't. Soon I will have no one left. Don't drink, Charley, one doesn't drink before work. Looks like things are not like they used to be. Me too, I've grown older. I'll do whatever you want, Charley. Have a good time with Froggy if you want, I don't mind. But please warn me if something happens that could put me behind bars. Because anyway, I wouldn't survive being behind bars. Now, I'll quietly have a glass or two. Just to feel like an Eskimo husband. Who will sleep in there? Huh, who will sleep in there? Charley? Yes. Maybe three of us could pull it off, with Froggy on the team. There are already more than enough maybe's in this business. I'm confident Froggy will play ball. I can never sleep in here... It's Rizzio, he's going to sleep downstairs. Talk to me. What am I gonna do with Charley? It's up to Charley to tell you. Tell me about afterwards. I don't know. I know. Charley will live at the Ritz in Paris, we'll see him at all the race courses. With an Italian duchess. You know how he'll call his horses? "Like us" And then? Rizzio will get a farm, in Saskatchewan. He'll have a nice wife, half Jewish and half Indian. And you know what he will call his children? "Like us" Pepper will go back to New Orleans. She'll learn nice manners. She won't eat with her fingers any more. And Tony he'll get a harem, and end up in a crummy boxing gym. with some young buck who can't punch. And you? And us? You don't agree. Come lay down. I'm not sleepy. Be careful my, friend... be careful. Tony... Tony! What? Get dressed, we're going. Where to? Somewhere, nobody will find us. I know a place, the other side of the border. But Sugar, think about it first. I've been thinking for hours, let's go! Why? Because I'm afraid. I don't know what you're running from, but it's not the police. In your sleep you talk about dead children. Your holdup... that was it a lie. and now, I would tell Charley, but he'll kill you. And if not Charley, it'll be Pepper who'll kill you. Here or there, they'll kill me anyway. Tony, don't get involved! That's enough now! Matonne! I'll explain, Charley! Enough, just try to open your mouth! I don't want to hear you one time until we split, do you get me? But... Not one word! What happened? Pepper wanted to leave, but I stopped her from taking the canoe. Who did she shoot at? At Matonne. Go back, you too. Get me that bag. But... If you get arrested for vagrancy, you'll blow everything! I'll either succeed, or I die. I won't leave anyone behind. Not even you, Pepper! Are you staying or not? Is it him or me? Give her that gun Charley. Finish this thing once and for all. You think maybe it's not loaded. Give her that gun. Is it true that you killed my brother? You chalk up another point, Froggy. My name isn't Froggy. Tony. My name isn't Pepper. Myrna. Hi Charley. And the cartridges? In the other box. That's Froggy, he's with us. Mastragos. Renner is dead. I heard on TV. Doesn't that change things for you? Why should it? He gave me all the blueprints. For your brother, Pepper. Where's Paul? In town. 15,000, as we agreed. You should also bring me a car, Mastragos. You'll have it. When? I have my worries, Charley. Paul who isn't here, Renner who's dead, all that worries me. I have a lot at stake in this too. Hey, redoing the lawn Charley? Can I see? You, help him. You come with me. Try it on. Still one left for a group photo. Great! That'll be yours? Yes. Just to recognize it. Don't move! Not bad. Show me! The photo was taken before. Who had the camera yesterday? He's photographed you, and you had no suspicion. I like photography. Go on. Well, nothing. You sure have noticed something, with those 2 men. Sure, the one who came later, he had a watch on each wrist. I thought, that's not practical. If they show a different time, you can't be sure of anything. OK, that'll be all madam. Isola. You know, that's Ilo in Italian. Say, will I be in the paper? You wait for the others in Montreal, I'll take care of the car. We're closed, didn't you see the sign? You don't refuse water to a man with a gun. You can get it over there. You're more welcoming to others. The French for instance. You've given me water, I'll tell you a story by way of saying thank you. Don't bother. It's a sad, but very interesting story. Get out! Once upon a time, in France children were singing at the beach. Children of our race. What is that? A theatre. That'll be our point of departure. To go where? Suppose we're in America. We attack a skyscraper, and we'll have all the police against us. You'll attack police headquarters? Exactly! There, 18th floor. What are you going to steal up there? Something priceless, Froggy. Might be worth $1M, or nothing at all. In our case, a million dollars. OK. When? It's for tonight, Froggy. The prison, Froggy. That's where you get out. I've bought 2 tickets to New Orleans. Tomorrow at noon. Two? I have my passport Paul's. OK? OK. Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Hi Lester. Hi. How is McCarthy? Nervous. Everybody's nervous. Except you. Where will the exchange take place? I'll take you there. Now burn that photo in your brains. If tomorrow something has changed in the landscape, you don't discuss. You don't think. You shoot. Another problem. We will have the sun in our eyes. They must really be on guard to have the sun in front. Yes, that's how they are in McCarthy's gang. Well, then we'll be there first. Exactly. My grandpa, in Michigan, he told me that he was born in a tree. That was always around this time. He drank a lot, my grandpa. So did you guess what we're going to steal tonight? No. A human being. A woman. She's worth a million dollars to an Italian gunman who amassed a fortune and who calls himself McCarthy. He's being held in the Montreal penitentiary, faces trial in 1 week. This woman is the top witness, they guard her on the 18th floor. He's known her since she was 13. After that something got stuck in her head, she's still 13 years old. She talks and talks, she doesn't know what she's saying. They call her Toboland. Come with me. Renner talked before he died. I've already told you all I had to say. Conclusion? No use inquiring any further. I'll get into that 18th floor and I'm coming out. For nothing? For $1 million. Did you get it now? I'll replace Toboland by another and I pull it off myself. What will Matonne and Rizzio say? I have other worries. And McCarthy? When he finds out he paid for nothing? He'll have other worries. You talk better than Renner. You talk like a real professional. What are you making? A passport for Mr. Smith. $20 on your part, Froggy. Exactly. What have they told you? Everything. Conclusion? You can imitate Charley all you want, he will not venture out with an amateur. You really decided for Charley tonight. Give me a chance, Sugar. Tony, why that passport? I have to leave. With me? Give me a chance, too. Is it true? I'm just waiting for the moment you're alone. We won't come here tomorrow with the others. Why did we put on evening clothes? We can't cross to the lower level otherwise. Yes, sure. This number, does that mean you're with security? My photo is in the papers tonight. I beg your pardon? The one who attacked me is here. Box 18. Look Miss, I... Isola. I have to call inspector Barney. It's my turn. Hey, tell Froggy to join me at the Bonaventure hotel. OK? Tony won't come, Sugar. He'll leave with me. I don't believe you. Mr. Hale, Mrs. Smith. He was here. Are you sure? Yes. She was with him. Would you come with us, please? I beg your pardon? Follow me. You too, Miss. A present from Renner. They can block all the streets, we'll come back the same way. Jelly Nut! Jane Bargim is dead. She went and committed suicide. Mama is home alone, but her sister's name is Jackie. I thought we had more time before they change the guards. I don't remember which watch I checked. It shows the same time. Get out! Sir, a call for you. Pretty music. Charley kept his word. He's taken Toboland. Where's Rizzio? And Toboland? Come on. It's not my fault. They told me to phone, so I phones. I'm talking to you. Go back to your dad. I don't have any. When I was little, you know what my mother used to say? If you talk about your dad once more, the Gypsies are gonna get you. Who? The Gypsies. Yes, the Gypsies. There's a ring in the back of the doll. Pull it. Please don't send me back to school! What are you doing? Teaching her another language. You want to take her picture too? I know Rizzio. He'll never talk. Alright... I know where they are. OK, let's go. Where are they? On the back. You go first. Now lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. Jimmy! Ah, don't make me repeat, come up now! Good night! Look, you're rich Charley. All the money in the world, you see? I see two bags. OK Pepper. Talk to me. Medium! Come on, come home. Look how they've tattooed you. Charley! Bang bang! Don't move, you're dead! A rifle. Is that him? And they were all involved in last night's raid. Where did you get that? From her. The guy we caught at the shoot, that Rizzio, he had a watch on each wrist. Who is he? Somebody who bet $10 on God. For Rizzio. Where are the others? What others? If you do that I'll shout! Whoever held this gun lost a lot of blood. I'd say if he couldn't see a doctor... That's not true... You know him better than me. Was it somebody who abandons his gun? Perhaps you still have time to grant him a doctor. How many were you in that box? Those others... I wasn't with them. And the others? I didn't see them. And they didn't do anything to me. And why wasn't he with them? That's all I know. Get a doctor first. Give them a doctor. Very well, we'll get them at your place. Always the same. People like me to play, but I don't really count. I'll tell you where they are. I'll tell you, yes, I'll tell you! Take a glass. Will Sugar come? The line is cut off. Go and look outside, Pepper. What's your name, Froggy? Antoine Cardot. Mine is Charley Ellis. They're coming to the island, Charley. By the bridge? By the river. Take the bag Tony, and get out of here you both. No! For 7 years you haven't disobeyed me. You're not gonna start now. Take her with you. And you? Get the hell out! What's the matter? I think they're here, on this side. Are they there? Get me my plane ticket. What? We can't leave together. I'll join you tomorrow, with the noon flight. I don't want to leave you. And I don't wanna leave Charley. I promise, I'll be in New Orleans tomorrow. I promise, Myrna. Do what I tell you! I promise! It's me, Charley! Pepper has left. My grandpa in Michigan, he tamed a hare once. A real hare, with big ears. He ran away and the hunters opened fire on him. You couldn't imagine... They came from everywhere. For 3 days. For 3 days on end they chased him all over the field. And each time, he found a new trick and he ran faster, and faster. And in the end, did they get him? No. My grandpa taught him too many things. Why did you come back? To bring you marbles. I'll play you for them. We're going to welcome quite a crowd. It's time to open up the joint. A marble each time a shot hits the sign.
