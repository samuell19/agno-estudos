02: Alone I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke I could make a woman hang on every single stroke I was an iron man I had a master plan But I was alone I could hear you breathing With a sigh of the wind I remember how your body started trembling Oh, what's a night it's been And for the state I'm in I'm still alone And all the wonders made for the Earth And all the hearts in all creation Somehow I always end up alone Always end up alone So I play, I'll wait Cause you know that love takes time We came so far Just the beat of a lonely heart And it's mine I don't want to be alone Well, since I got no message on your answer phone And since you're busy every minute I just stay at home I make believe you care I feel you everywhere But I'm still alone I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate Am I the subject of the pain Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone And if there glory there to behold Maybe it's my imagination Another story there to be told So I play, I'll wait And I pray it's not too late We came so far Just a beat of a lonely heart And it's mine And I don't want to be alone Gone, but not out of sight I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home Face the heat of the night The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone Shine and search for the light And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home 03: Massachusetts Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts Something's telling me I must go home And the lights all went out in Massachusetts The day I left her standing on her own Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco Gotta do the things I wanna do And the lights all went out in Massachusetts They brought me back to

take your heart away It's only words and words are all I have To take your heart away It's only words 07: Closer Than Close She'll read your mind, she's smart as a whip She'll suck you dry, but look at how much I drip At the point of ecstasy, I write a symphony Of poetry in motion, and leaving me there to die I tell myself, let no one take her place To confide in someone, and look at how much I paid I want you next to me, call it telepathy We drifted into vision and look how much we see I just want to get closer than close to you I know that one way or the other Any test of my faith will do

no conversation We ride it together, ah ha Making love with each other, ah ha Islands in the stream That is what we are No one in between How can we be wrong Sail away with me To another world And we rely on each other, ah ha From one lover to another, ah ha I can't live without you when the love is gone Everything is nothing when you got no one And you just walk in the night Slowly losing sight of the real thing But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt Too deep in love and we got no way out And the message is clear This could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry Baby, I will hurt you never We start and end as one In love forever We can ride it together, ah ha Making love with each other, ah ha Islands in the stream That is what we are No one in between How can we be

one Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun The taste of love is sweeter like honey on the vine Like the wind that feeds the fire, two souls become entwined Someday baby you and I should be one, one So I'm standing 'round this corner Tall enough to touch the New York sky, oh yes My love is so blind I just cannot hear or see the world go by, oh yes Someone can love so completely One kiss should break the sea Truth can be stranger than fiction This love is real This love is real Someday baby you and I should be one, one Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun Ah, we are one, we are one I will follow Count on me, I'll never let you down, oh yes My devotion If love is like an ocean I will surely drown, oh yes You'll be my only possession I'll be a slave
