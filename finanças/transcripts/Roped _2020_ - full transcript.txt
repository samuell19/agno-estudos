Think you can handle it? - Yeah, no problem. ♪ Yeah, when all your worries get stuck in your trucks ♪ ♪ Hey, oh, hey, oh ♪ ♪ When you think well, that's all she wrote, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, oh, hey oh ♪ Not a fan of the rodeo? - Yeah, that's not my cup of Kool-Aid. - My family and I are examples of mindful living. I've made myself perfectly clear on this issue to our esteemed mayor. I don't see why we have to have a rodeo back in this town after all these years. Our community has long stood for high values and common decency to all creatures. Mr. Mayor. You've not represented the wishes of the people of Potter Creek by bringing this display of animal abuse to our town. - Are you gonna let me speak or is this the Robert show? - I feel like you have spoken by making this decision without consulting any of the council members. - I talked to Carl and he thought it was good idea. - I'm calling for a complete boycott of this event. Spread the word to your friends that people still run this town even if our elected official refuses to acknowledge that. - Good job in there babe. - Thank you sweetheart. Eddie and Carl are still gonna go. - Hey, can I go to the diner with Britney? - Tracy, don't you have something to say to your dad? - You killed in there Mr. Councilman. - Thank you. - Can I please go to the diner now? - I could really use your help setting up for the farmer's market tomorrow. - Luke can do it. - Hey. - I can use both of your help. - We have enough volunteers for two farmers' markets. Go ahead. - Thanks Mom. - Yes. - Let's do it. - Okay, we're gonna go to the diner because their fries are so good. Are you coming? Hello, space to Tracy. Oh, my God Trace. Your dad is such a buzzkill. - I know. I cannot wait to get to college. - Do you know my parents want to drive me? Like can you imagine Ernie talking to my dorm mates, like oh my gosh, I used to go here like a hundred years ago. - No. - That's so embarrassing. - Well, Dylan wants to drive me. - Of course he does. Because he wants to piss all over your territory so none of the college boys hit on you. - That is not why. Oh, my God, that's totally why. - Totally why. Ugh, why don't you break up with him? - We're gonna be like a thousand miles apart. That's kind of like a breakup, right. - No, that's kinda lame. - Shut up. Look Trace. It's the rodeo. - Oh, yeah. Where are you taking me? Duh, I want to see what all the fuss is about. Britney! What? What are we gonna do? - You're gonna live a little. Come on. Come on, come on. Aw, they're like 20 sweaters waitin' to happen. - This is the big bad rodeo. - Or maybe it's the petting zoo. - Wait, what are you doing? - I'm gonna catch one of these broncos. - Britney! - Shh. Get the shot. Tracy get the shot, get the shot. Get the shot. - Fine. - Take the shot. - Okay, I got it, now get out. - No, switch. - No. - Switch! - No. - You're such a scaredy cat. Get in here. - No. - Are you scared they're gonna smell your daddy, come on. - Fine. Gosh. - Here, give me your phone. Go! - Ha! Get it girl. Get it cowgirl. Get it girl. - Hey, what the hell you girls doing over here? - Let's get out. - Get outta here. Y'all all right? They bother you? Anybody get their names? Dylan's outside you know. - Yeah, I saw him. I'm not here to hang out with the bros. - Are you guys fighting? - When are they not fighting? - Shut up. - You girls gonna order anything? - Oh, hi, Jenna. - Hey, Britney. - Um, can I order fries please. I'll get a chocolate milkshake. - Fries, milkshake, got it. - And I'll have a cheeseburger. - No way. - Are you serious? - Okay, vegetarian girl gone wild. - What, I can order a cheeseburger if I want to. - So a burger? - Yes. - Okay, darlin'. - Your mom thought Luke would have more fun with you ladies. - Sure thing, Mr. Peterson. - Okay, well then I'll just leave him here with you then. Uh. For, uh. - Thanks Dad. - Will you save my spot, I gotta use the restroom. - Yeah. - Well, you better enjoy that burger. It's gonna be your last meal. - Ah, dang it. - Man, are you kiddin' me? Hey! Watch it pal, it's a brand-new truck. - Aw, I'm sorry, is this your car? - It's a truck pal. And yeah, it's mine. - Well, I think it looks okay. - I don't think you can tell in this light. - Uh, wanna take a look yourself. - Just said you can't tell here. What's your problem, man? - Ooh, I don't have a problem. You know what? I'll be in Potter Creek all week with the rodeo. If you see any damage of any kind, you can bring it by there and I'll take care of it. - So I'm supposed to just trust you? - I don't know. Do you have any other ideas? - I'll find you. - Won't be hidin'. Howdy y'all. - That's him. He's cute. - I know. - Scooch. - Luke, please stop. - Oh, come on, just scoot over. - No, find somewhere else to sit. - Man. Too much. - I'm not mean. Sorry, Luke, I need the booth for a group of six. - Oh, man. - Hey, buddy? You need a seat? - Nah, I'm fine. - No, hold on. Um... Hey, guys, are you saving that seat for anyone? Kid needs a place to sit. - Sure whatever. - Thank you. Here's the thing, he's with me so if you guys could just slide down, that'd be great, thank you. - Let's get outta here. Dumb hick. - Now we have three seats. Come on. - Thanks. - No problem. - Thought that guy was gonna punch you. - Aw, he just needed a little love, that's all. Hey, isn't that your sister over there? - Yeah. They won't let me sit with them. - Sounds like a big sister. Are you hungry? - Yeah. - What are you gettin'? - I'm thinking about beef sliders or some fries. - Okay. Here you go darlin'. - Dig in. - Luke. My brother and I have to go. - Wait, we just got our food. - Yeah, Luke's a vegetarian. - Could've fooled me. - You should not have bought him all that. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - Yeah, there's a lot you don't know cowboy. This town doesn't want your rodeo here. - Yeah, I heard. I was at the meeting. - Yeah, that loud old guy was my dad. - Wait, so he's like the spiritual leader of the city or what? - Yeah, he likes to think so. Look, I'm sorry, but we really have to go, come on. - Thanks Colton. Luke! - Sorry. Seriously? That's great. - Wouldn't want you to get anything on your pants or shirt. - Well, I appreciate that, sir. - Hey, hey, hey! Why the hell are you just getting back? - Oh, hey, Shawn. I just got a little turned around coming back from town. I'm sorry. - You understand that this job isn't like a job on a cruise ship, don't you, son? Where you pull into a different port every night. - It won't happen again, sir. - See that it doesn't. Well, don't just stand there-- put your toilet paper away and come help me in the damn barn. - You got it sir. Don't worry about him. He's throwing his weight around to feel important. - Yeah, well, he's more important than me. - Well, yeah, by a lot. He just told me one of the riders got hurt in PBR Premier Series. - Wait. - Hold on, show respect. - Vince, that's insane, are you kidding me. - Mm-hmm. - They called you up? - Oh, no, not yet, I just need a clean ride this weekend, I have the points to qualify. - That's amazing. - Mm-hmm. I talked to my wrangler rep about you again. Thinking about sponsoring you. Be here this weekend. - Uh, this weekend? - Mm-hmm. - The town hates the rodeo. - A few people aren't gonna stop a PPR event. - No, it's not just a few people. It's a whole town of people. Everyone wants to boycott it. - Ah, it'll be fine. So, it'll stir the pot in this town, you know. We got plenty of folks to fill our seats. - But Vince, you know-- - Hey, look, I've seen this deal before man. We all have. Just focus on your rides. Be a wrangler man in no time. - Why are you just getting back? - Hank, you scared me. - Everything okay, dude? - Yeah, I guess so. - Yeah, so why'd it take you four hours to go get toilet paper? - Some local idiot let the hours out of one of my tires. - Was he bigger than you? - Not really. - So he's dead now? - No, Hank, I didn't see him do it. - Aw. Come on man. You're terrible at making friends, you know that. - Hey, would you help me with some of this stuff? - I will. I will help you carry one roll of toilet paper. - Hank. - I'll go install it immediately, too. Poop is weakness leaving the body. - You kiddin' me? Nope! - Did you guys have fun? - Yeah, I met a cowboy today. - You did? - Yeah, he was sittin' by himself at the diner, so I kept him company. - Oh, that's nice of you. Go get ready for bed. A cowboy? - Yeah. It was just some guy from the rodeo. - You know, you two aren't making this week any easier. - I'm sorry. - Your dad's waiting for you in his office. - Well, that sounds fun. - Mm-hmm. You know you can catch more flies with honey. - I know, I know. - Go. - That was illuminating. - Dad, I'm sorry. - Apologize to the cow you had killed for your dinner. - Dad, I just wanted a burger this one day, this one time. - This family stands for something. Doesn't the mean anything to you? - Yeah, it mostly does. But, why does it have to be so rigid? - You're either part of the solution or you're part of the problem. - Can I go now? - You can go. ♪ Setting me up on top ♪ ♪ Don't try to put me down ♪ ♪ Holdin' on for dear life ♪ ♪ Eight seconds at a time ♪ ♪ Some folks say I'm crazy ♪ ♪ But it's the only life I know ♪ ♪ Just a cowboy ridin' in a rodeo ♪ ♪ Drive from town to town ♪ ♪ To try to take the prize ♪ ♪ Keep my name up on the board ♪ ♪ Catch the latest eyes ♪ ♪ The rope is my salvation ♪ ♪ For how long I don't know ♪ ♪ I'm just a cowboy ridin' a rodeo ♪ ♪ I'm a cowboy ♪ ♪ Ridin' a rodeo ♪ - Hey, Colton.

So what, what's good here. - Well, if you haven't tried a tofu dog, then you really haven't lived. - Okay, I always wanted to try new things I guess. - I see you've met my girlfriend. - Didn't see that comin'. - So, you two know each other? - Yeah, yeah, we had a nice conversation yesterday. Left me feeling a little deflated, though. - Aw. That's a real shame Mr. Cowboy. Maybe you just don't belong around here. - Dylan. - Yeah, I been gettin' that a lot. - Come on babe, gotta get some tomatoes for my mom. - Okay. Bye Colton. - Yeah, bye Colton. - He's a tool. - Yeah, I kinda picked up on that. - You must be the cowboy everyone's talking about. I'm Robert. - Colton, sir. I heard you speakin' at the town hall yesterday. - I thought that was you that walked in. You learn anything? - I learned that you and I think very differently, sir. - We all do. We're a progressive community with forward thinking ideas about the world we live in. Rodeo's from a day long since passed. - I don't know, I think there's still plenty of cowboys in America, sir. - Maybe your rodeo draws a crowd in some parts of the country, but so do dog fights. We stand on the right side of history with this one. Luke, go find your mother and tell her we're heading home. - But Dad... - Don't call me "but Dad," go find your mom, come on. Maybe I can't force you out of our town, but I suggest while you're here, you stay on your side of the tracks and away from my family. - Shouldn't you be driving a Prius or something. - Oh, I like havin' a little muscle between my legs. - It's loud. Is it fast, too? - Fastest ride in town. - You wanna put that to the test? - You challenin' me to a race? - I guess I am. - Well, you really are dumber than you look and that's sayin' somethin'. - 3 o'clock then out at the fairground. - Oh, I'll be there. - Hank. We all good? - You got lucky Buddy. Shawn went into town to sign some permits. He didn't even know you were gone. - Hey, I need your help with somethin'. - Why you always givin' me stuff to carry? - No, that's just some stuff I picked up at the farmer's market. - You risk gettin' fired over some local fruit? - Do you remember that guy that was messin' with my tire? - Is this organic. Hank! What? - Tire guy. - Oh, yeah, tire guy, I remember. - I think he thinks I'm after his girlfriend. - Shut up. You met a girl? - No. Maybe. - Colton Burtenshaw, Mr. Hardworking Cowboy, falls in love with a townie. You know I bet she shaves her pits. I knew you had some real blood flowing in your veins and not just cow poo. - What is wrong with you? - You know if I was him, I'd just slash all your tires. - Hank, we got bigger problems with now. - Bigger than a boyfriend lookin' to kill you and your vehicle? - Bigger in scope, yeah. - I do not know what that word means. - Come on, I'll show you. And it may or may not have to do with a race and Trigger and a big ol' truck. - Sounds stupid. No, it's not, trust me, come on. - Hey Trace. - Are you serious Dyl? - What? - So what, you're gonna go all macho on this cowboy with your big bad truck? - Why are you mad at me? He's the one that wanted to race in the first place. - Really? So, you had nothing to do with it. Colton just walked up and challenged you to some stupid race? - You worried about me, Trace, or you worried somethin' might happen to your new friend? - Friend? I don't even know him. - Mm-hmm. - Dylan, you don't even care what I think. - You don't care what I think. - Okay, well great, don't kill yourself. Yeah, I'll try not to. - Barrel racin'? This is how you're gonna impress the town folk? - It's not exactly barrel racing. - No, it's a lot dumber. Look man, I don't like that Trigger's caught up in all this. - Trigger's gonna have fun today, don't worry about that. - If anything happens to him, I will kill you before any boyfriends can. - I hear you. - And then Shawn's gonna kill you again and he's gonna light your body on fire. - Anybody ever tell you you worry too much? - No, they don't. 'Cause then I'm gonna go get some marshmallows, and I'm gonna stick 'em on a stick and I'm gonna light those marshmallows on your body flames. - Okay. - Hey, you know, why don't we-- Speakin' of flames, why don't we just get flamin' hoops and you just-- - Get back to work. - All right. - Yo, Dyl. Dude, there's like dirt all over my mom's Prius. She's gonna like kill me. - Dude, shut up. - All right. - You made it. - 3 o'clock as promised. - Very good. Well, I laid out a course here. We start at the poles. Make sure you go all the way around the barrels. A couple surprises on the back end and then we're gonna shoot down here through the finish line. But it's nothin' you can't handle. - All right. I'll play your little cowboy games. Let's see what you got. What do you think you can drive that's gonna beat my ride? - Oh, you're lookin' at him. Trigger, I'd like you to meet Dylan. Dylan, this is Trigger. - What is this? - This is your competition. One horse power, that's all I need. - Really, you're gonna race me on a horse. - You're gonna race us in a truck? - Aw, let's get this thing started. - Let's do it. - Hey! Come on! Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you think you're doin'? - Winnin' pal. - Yah! Come on. Come on! - I understand you put on quite the little show today. - I got all my work done. - Well. You got all your work done. Well, son of a gun. Seems to me everybody around here got all of their work done today. But it also seems to me that there's only one person's name around here I keep hearing about and that name happens to be yours. - Shawn, I was standin' up for the rodeo. At least the town's talking about us now. - You wanna answer to the PPR? Because some kid in some town broke his neck while racing a cowboy in his truck? I've had it. I've had it up to my eyeballs with this town, I've had it up to my eyeballs with you, with this whole let's boycott the rodeo nonsense. Here's a newsflash for you, Colton. I'm not gonna let you ride this weekend. - But Shawn, I got a sponsor comin'. Trace, you should go see him. - Okay, so what, what do I do, just walk in there and ask someone for the guy who raced against a truck? - That sounds like a plan to me. - What about Dylan? - What about him? Look, in my mind, he lost you in battle. - Stop. - Look at the facts Miss Lawyer Girl. Dylan bad. Cowboy good. - You know this weekend's big for both of us, right? - I know, I just, I got into a beef with this guy from town. - A guy from town. Colton, man, you gotta start thinkin' about the big picture. - I'm sorry. - Don't be, it's over. Look, when you turn 30, you'll stop doin' dumb shit. Until then, you gotta shut this down. - You got it. - Okay. - Wow. Cowboy and a carpenter. - What are you doin' here? - Oh, I just thought that I would come by and congratulate you on your big win today. - Well, uh, you caught me celebrating. - Looks fun. - Yeah, I basically got my ass handed to me about the race. - Yeah, I'm sorry, but that was kind of stupid. - I know, I know. But it's bigger than just racing a horse through some dirt, you know. Like, it's about a man and an animal working together for a common goal. - That sounds important. - It is. It is to me anyway. - I get that. - Well, hey, I, uh, think I can punch out. - With who? - Rodeo god. What, it's a thing. - Yeah. - You want me to show you around? - I do. I don't need a hammer, do I? - Oh, no, just an escort. - Lead the way. - Ooh. - Watch out. - It's like a minefield in here. - Nah, I'll get you through. Can't have a rodeo without these guys. - Baby calves? - They're roping steers, but. - They're really cute. - I guess so. - Don't you feel bad, roping them up and riding them and stuff? - You know cowboys don't actually ride cows, right? - Come on, I'm serious. - We only rope 'em when we have to. Other than that, we treat them like the little princesses that they are. Come on. I want you to meet somebody. Here's the fierce stallion. - Wait a minute, his name's Trigger for real? - Yeah, it's classic. - So what's that make you, John Wayne? - Uh, Roy Rogers actually. - Oh, like the restaurant. - Oh, my gosh, you're kiddin' me, right? - Yes. - Better be. So what's your story? You being groomed to take over the family business? - Hardly. I'm off to UC Santa Cruz next month. - That sounds cool. - Yeah, it is. They have this joint program where I can get my bachelor's degree and my law degree in six years. - Are you gonna be a lawyer? - That's the plan. - Wow. You know I could never do that. Sittin' in a court room givin' speeches and askin' questions and all that. - Oh, I bet you'd be better at it than you think. - Maybe. If I was sittin' on a horse or somethin'. - No, you just have to be passionate about what you're saying. - Still sounds scary. - What about you? Mm, you gonna be a cowboy your whole life? - It's all I've known. I grew up on a ranch up north. - Family business? - Four generations on my dad's side. - You being groomed to take over the family business? - Nah. We had to get rid of the ranch a while back, but I hope to have one of my own someday. Till then I'm just a travelin' cowboy. - Do you sing? - What? No, why? - I thought all traveling cowboys sang and play guitar under the moonlight. - You got so much to learn. Think you're comin' to the rodeo this weekend? - Well, now I really want to. - Well, I'd love it if you could come. - I'll see what I can do. - You gonna get home safe? - I can drive these roads with my eyes closed. - I don't know, maybe don't do that. - I won't. I promise. - You wanna know somethin'? I would really, really like to kiss you right now. - I have a boyfriend. - Yes, ma'am, I'm aware of that. I shouldn't have said anything. - No, it's okay. - Goodnight, Miss Tracy. - It has been an absolute pleasure. - Goodnight cowboy Colton. And the pleasure was all mine. - You know he's a lucky guy. - You're late. - Yeah, I'm sorry, I totally lost track of time. - Where were you? - I was just out at the diner with Britney. - It closes at 11. - Well, we went to her house afterwards. - You have a curfew of 12:30. I don't want to have to start to check up on you. - Well, you don't, Dad. I'm practically in college. - Does this look like college to you, 'cause this looks like my home. It's my home, it's my rules and in my home you have a curfew. - Okay. Fine. - I heard about what happened at the fairgrounds today. Were you there? - Yeah. A bunch of us went out there. - It doesn't help me to convince the townspeople that the rodeo's a bad idea if my own daughter won't stay away. - Well, it wasn't the rodeo Dad. It was a race that Dylan was in. I had to go. - Your behavior reflects upon me. I don't wanna hear about you going out there again. - Okay, fine, Dad, whatever. I'm going to bed. - Goodnight. Colton, get a move on. These animals ain't gonna take care of themselves. I see you peekin'. Don't you dare go back to sleep Colton. Colton! - Shoot. - Come on man.

Why the sudden interest in wantin' to be a cowboy? - Well. Girls like cowboys. - What makes you say that? - My sister likes you. - All right. Well, let me show you the ropes. And like really, there are ropes. Just set the bucket right over there. There you go. And stay back. Now the idea is to stay away from the business end, so come on over here. Here you go boy. Use a little brush. And just nice and easy go with the flow of their hair. You got it, you can go a little harder than that. Good. You gotta do this every day. Ooh. - Whoa. - It's only poop. Gotta get used to it if you wanna be a cowboy. You ever pet a sheep before? Check it out. Let's give him a little nibble. That's it. That's it. How cool is that? Good job. You wanna give him a little more? Here's a little more. All right, put your foot in. Now swing your leg up. No, no, no, swing it over the back. Hand on the horn lookin' forward. There you go, that's it. Good boy. You got it? Good work. How's it feel? - Good. - Now you're a cowboy. Hit some. - It's getting late. Where's Luke? Have you guys seen Luke? Nope, sorry. - My dad's gonna kill me if we're not back for dinner. - Well, his bike is gone. Maybe he just left. - And I think I know where. - Okay, man remember chin down, chest out, lift on that rope and keep pulsin'. Ready? Lift. Bear down. Bear down! - How's he stay on? - He's been doin' it a long time. You know he's one of the best bull riders in the PBR? We're lucky to have him. He just needs a few more points to get back to the big show. - Get back? - Yeah, he took a rough spill about a year back. He doesn't always stay on. - I knew I'd find you here. - Colton's teaching me how to be a cowboy. - Luke, Dad would be so pissed if he knew you were here. - Why? - Yeah, we're not doin' anything wrong. - We're not supposed to be here. At all. - I should probably go. Thanks for helpin' me today. - I'm sorry. - Bear down. Come on Vince! - I passed out over 300 flyers today. We're gonna have a good showing at the meeting tomorrow. - That's great. - Thank you. Tracy, Luke, don't make any plans tomorrow. I'm gonna need your support, okay? - Sure Dad. Hey, did you guys go to Potter's Creek today. It was so hot. - Yeah, it was great. - You go in the water? - Not exactly. No, he'd rather buzz around on the stupid bike than ever go in the water. - I just don't like getting in with all the people. - Tracy. Don't tease him. - He's such a wimp. - Colton doesn't think so. - Wait, the rodeo guy? He was there? - He just came down to the river that's all. - You know him, too. - Dad, he's so awesome. He showed me around the rodeo. I met his horse. - Today? Yeah. - You were supposed to be watching him. - I was. - By lettin' him hang out with a cowboy. - Well, he obviously took care of him. - You don't even know this guy. - Yes, I do. Dad, maybe you don't know anything about rodeos. - Wait, wait, have you been hanging out with this guy? You like this guy? You think he even cares about you? I mean a small town girl on one of his stopovers around the country. - Robert. - Thanks, Dad. Thanks for thinking of me as just some small town girl. - I love you babe, but sometimes you take it too far. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doin'? - Well, my truck took a bit of a beating yesterday. - Yeah, well, that was a pretty wild race. - Yeah. Cowboy did all right. - Everybody was asking about you at the river. - Cool. - Dylan, we need to talk about us. - Yeah, what's there to say? - I love you Dyl. I have since I was five. And what we've had together has been good. When it's good. - What are you saying? - I'm saying we've grown apart this summer. Way, way apart. And I think we can both agree on that and this is not anybody's fault. I think it's just something that happens. I mean, we're both going to different colleges in a few weeks. And if we fight like we do in the same town, how are we gonna make a long distance relationship work. - So is that your closing argument counselor? - I'm sorry Dyl. - Me, too. - I'll see you around? - Yeah. Hey. You're gonna make a hell of a lawyer. - Thanks. - Probably a divorce lawyer, but. - I'm goin' to bed. - Our little girl's gone. - Our little girl was gone the day she started middle school. - Only this is different. - Honey, this is nothing. A rodeo, cowboy, I mean, it's right on schedule. - I just, I don't want her to get hurt. - Well, I can't promise you that she won't. It comes with the territory. - I don't know if I can handle that. - Well, I think you're gonna have to, 'cause you either get on board or you get left behind. - I wish it was that easy. - That's what you have me for. 'Cause I challenge you. And I raise your game. And I'm not goin' anywhere. I seem to remember another very sexy rebellious teenager. - That doesn't really help. - Don't stay up too late. - Gosh, man. I'm beat. - No one told you to stay up till 1 a.m. - How'd you know I did that? - Look around you, man. You think we got anything else to talk about around here? Our last conversation was about dirt, true story. Colton. - Tracy, what are you doing here? - Can we talk? - Yeah. - Looks like another long night. - Shut up. I just thought you should know. - So your dad's behind all this? - Yeah. He's on a mission. - Man, he must be beside himself. - Oh, no, if it wasn't the rodeo, it would be something else. - No, I'm talking about you leavin' for college. - No. I think he's happy just to get rid of me. - You're his little girl. - Were your parents mad when you up and joined the rodeo? - They had bigger problems. - What does that mean? - I had a little brother. His name was Tommy. He would've been about Luke's age by now. - What happened? - My dad and I were bringing in the cattle. Tommy wasn't even supposed to be there. He was always so eager. And I don't know. The cattle got spooked and he slipped through the fence. I couldn't get to him. He didn't make it. - Your poor parents. - Yeah, my mom blamed my dad. She never let him live it down. And I guess one day my dad had enough and he just up and left. He didn't say goodbye or anything. He just disappeared. - I'm so sorry Colton. - It's just I, I look at your life and I miss that. I wish my family still looked like that. - I get that. - And I know family is hard. I remember fightin' with my folks. But, we lost that fight. Your folks are still in your life. - Yeah. - And now you're leavin' them. Leavin's hard, it's always gonna be hard. - Yeah. - Hey. But there's a good way to do it and there's a bad way to do it. And the bad way hurts a lot worse. - You wanna know something? - What's that? - I really wanna kiss you right ow. - You wanna know somethin'. You have a boyfriend. - Not anymore. - Just a second. What? - Sorry to bother you, sir, but I found this flyer. - You found the flyer? - Yeah, look, they're tryin' to shut us down. - I know what they're tryin' to do Colton. I've seen the flyer, okay? - Well, what are we gonna do about it? - Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do about it. You're gonna go out there and you're gonna do your job or you're going to lose it. - I am doing my job. Hey, that is my problem, okay? I'll handle it. Now throw that thing in the trash. - Yes, sir. - We have to get everybody on board. Otherwise we can't legally stop it. - I am glad you called me Robert. This is exactly the kind of fight the ARA needs to be having right now. - Have you guys stopped other rodeos? - Rodeos are one of the top enemies for us. It is a true violation of animal rights. - Well, this town is all about supporting the animal rights. - I think we're gonna do some good work here today. - Colton. Did you hear? They're gonna shut us down. - Yeah, I heard. - What do you mean you heard? You need to get to that meetin'. - I'd make things worse. - What are you talkin' about? You're like the only person around here that even cares about this thing. - Shawn and Vince care, and they blame me for the whole mess. - What, that it's your fault the whole town doesn't like the rodeo? - No, that I made it worse. - Shut up, they're just lookin' for someone to blame. Go to the meeting. - You know Shawn's gonna be there. And he threatened to tell the wrangler rep that I caused the whole problem. - They're just blowin' smoke. - He'd fire me on the spot and you know it. - You're missing the bigger picture here Colt. Those are businessmen. They care about money. You care about us. You care about this rodeo. For real man, this is actually somethin' that you're passionate about. - Well, what if I. - You know I'm right. - Yeah. Yeah, you are. - I know, I usually am man. - All right, cover for me. - Yeah. - So I'm suggesting to you ladies and gentlemen, the decision to shut us down solely based on your personal beliefs is nothing short of irresponsible. Thank you. - I appreciate your concern, sir. But your rodeo is within our city limits and we have the final say on whether or not it happens. If all five council members vote nay, we will overturn the mayor's decision and there will be no rodeo. And there's nothing you can do about it legally or otherwise. Now to enlighten you all on the evil of the rodeo, I've invited ARA representative Gary Smoot to say a few words. - Thank you all for inviting me to take part in your honorable cause to put a halt to the barbaric practice of rodeo events in your city. I would like to show you some of the horrors that are taking place in the name of entertainment. Rodeo performers entertain the audience by provoking animals into unnatural behavior to make them look more impressive. They jolt the animals with electricity to make them more aggressive than they really are. They wrap bucking straps around the abdomen and groin of the animals and burn their skin to make them buck wildly. Riders yank calves into the air and slam them on the ground while they cry out and defecate in fear. Rodeos are constant trauma for the animals forced to participate. They suffer horrible injuries. - Wait. None of that's true. The ARA stands by these facts. Thank you Gary. I think you've proved your point. - I'm sorry, son, we've already heard from your side. We're gonna vote. Please sit down. - Mr. Councilman, if I may be heard. I don't mean any disrespect, but this young man has a right to tell the people of your city what he believes. And out of respect to everybody who's here today, let's hear what the kid has to say. - Yeah, man. - Okay, okay. Hey, everyone, settle down, settle down. Colton, is it? - Yes, sir. - You have the floor. - Thank you, sir. This gentleman, Gary, has shown you all some very serious animal abuse. And having seen that, I would vote right along side y'all to shut down whoever was doin' this to our animal friends. But it's not true. That is not what we do in our rodeo. I was raised on a ranch. I lived side by side with these animals my entire life. They are my family. They're our lifeblood. We do not hurt them for show. We don't zap them with those electric shock sticks. No, every bronco rider I know, he sits in that pen and he tries to calm that creature down. 'Cause it's his life on the line out there. And those straps that irritate the underbelly of the animal? No, that's not how the rodeo works. Those straps are lined with fleece. All right, I want everyone to picture the softest sweater that you own. That's what's pressed up against their skin. These animals are trained athletes. Their job is to kick that strap off. That's why they buck. They know what their job is. And they are treated very well to be a part of the rodeo. You can ask any stock contractor around. The animals are way more important than any of us cowboys. - Yahoo! - Ain't that the truth. - They are well fed and attended to at all times. If there is a medical issue, it is handled quickly and efficiently. The rodeo is a celebration. It's a celebration of skills that we have to use every single day. These events were born out of ranches wanting to compete with other ranches to see who had the toughest cowboys and the most talented workers. We rope calves because we have to day in and day out. Look, if a calf gets sick, do you think he just lies down and lets the doctor work on him? No. No, we have to rope them and tie them and that's how our job gets done. And don't get me wrong, the rodeo has changed over the years. It's evolved, just as America has. It's not some throwback to "Little House on the Prairie Days." No, this is our real life every day. So, come celebrate with us. Come be a part of what made America the country that it is today. And yes, I understand it is entertainment, but it's born out of our lives. It's my life. I'm a cowboy. And I'm damn proud of it. And I really hope to see y'all there. - All right now. - Thank you Colton for your impassioned words. You paint a very honorable picture of the rodeo and what it stands for. I hear what you say and yet what does the rodeo mean to the people outside of your experience? What do they get? Could something like this happen? This is what a rodeo looks like to people. You can talk all you want about your cowboy skills and your cowboy way of life. But when we hear the word rodeo, we picture animals being mistreated by people with no concern for their well-being. - Sir, would you please reconsider. - Cowboy! You said your piece, now sit down. - Time for the council to vote. Carl. With my vote, that makes it unanimous. There will be no rodeo in Potter Creek. Thank you everybody. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - For those of you who were not in town today, who actually stayed here, did your jobs, first of all I want to say how much I appreciate that. Second of all, I want to tell you that the rumors are indeed true. Tomorrow's show has been canceled. - What? - Come on. - Yeah. And for those of you who were in town today at the meeting, I have half a mind to fire you on the spot, but I'm not gonna do that because you all have a whole helluva lot of work to do. Weather man tells me there is one hell of the storm coming our way, so batten down the hatches. Colton. I appreciate the hell out of what you tried to do up there today. That is a cowboy. - Right here. Vicious attack dog. Ooh, you like that, you're a Chopley, yeah, you think you can beat me? Yeah. - Careful, Dad, looks like animal abuse to me. You had no right to use that picture today. - I didn't take that picture, Tracy, you did. - That was before I knew about Colton or the rodeo. - Not every person in this town is gonna get to become friends with a cowboy. That picture you took represents a disrespect for animals that the rodeo brings with it. - So you just embarrassed me in front of everybody. - I did what I had to do. At my expense. - You left me no choice. - Oh, Dad, no, you did have a choice. You chose your stupid cause over me! - Tracy. - No, save it, I don't wanna hear it. I have someone who deserves an apology from me. - You are not to go to those fairgrounds. - You left me no choice. Round up. Come on, get 'em over there. Come on, get to the back and hold 'em. Ooh, come on here. - Colton! Colton! Hey. Have you seen Colton? - Mm-mm. I'll put the rest of the saddles. - Colton. - Not a good time. - Colton, I'm sorry. - I'm busy, dammit. - Are you okay? - I'm not okay. Are you kiddin' me. Man, I thought I could handle anything they threw at me today. But you settin' me up, that was a low blow. You know nice work, lady lawyer. I never saw it comin'. - You have to understand, that picture was before I met you. - You made me look like an idiot. - But I didn't give it to him. I don't know, he must have found it somehow. I never even knew he had it. - Colton, come on. Help me secure the animals. The storm's comin' in. Up, up, bring 'em up, come on now. Make sure those are tied off. - Yeah, he's out of the pen. - Get around him. You got it. Come on. Come on now. Come on now, let's move. Hank, that gate's open. - I'll go get him. - No, kid, wait. Colton, the kid. - Dammit! Hyah! Luke! Colton, hurry. - Luke. - Colton's after him. Luke! - Hey, come back! Come back! Wait! Aah! - Luke, where are you? Someone help! Luke! - Help, help! Help! - I'm comin' for you buddy. Just hang on, I got you. - Help! - Luke! - Luke! - Grab the rope Luke. - Oh, my God. - Luke! - Luke! - Are you okay? - Hey, hey, hey, are you hurt? You okay? - I'm okay. - Luke! - Dad. - Are you okay? - I'm so sorry, Dad. - Are you okay? Look at me. - Tracy. - Oh, Colton. - Don't you ever do that to me again. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - I don't know what we would have done without you. - I think he's gonna be just fine. It's what we do here. - Hey, sweetheart. Can you give Colton and I a minute? - Be nice. - You saved my boy. - Trigger and I did, sir. - I guess that's some real cowboy skills in action. - That's what I was trying to say at the meeting, sir. It's what we do. - How about you show me around this place. I promise to keep an open mind about your rodeo. - Be my pleasure. You know, it would only take one person to change their vote. - Is that right. Yes, I know what I said Carl. But I witnessed what they do with my own eyes. I was wrong about them. - Well? What do you think? - I think you're an amazing woman. - Thanks, Daddy. - I learned something today. I learned that you're old enough to teach me a few new things about the world. - Now, where do you think I learned that from? - Probably your mother. - Probably. Where did you get it? - I know a few cowboys down at the rodeo. What do you think? - I couldn't think of a better way to complete this outfit. - That's my girl. - Always and forever. Next up is the current first place rider in the ropin' event. Colton Burtenshaw. Rider, you ready? And he's out. And that's a solid throw. Look at that, it's gonna be done absolutely perfect. - Whoa, he is good. - Yeah, I knew he would be. Colton Burtenshaw takes first place. Well, it's been an exciting day folks. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the main event. Now the PBR is here tonight and with a clean ride, our very own Vince Lockwood has a shot to get into the PBR Premier Steering. - Hey, give 'em a good show will you Vince. - You not scared your girl might fall for me? - Nah, I don't think she likes volunteering at the old folks home. - Ooh. Thanks for what you do, Colton. I wouldn't be here without you. I mean that. - You would have done the same, right. - All right. - Give 'em hell Vince. - He missed us, but I know he can. He'll be back to the big time. Everything comes down to this ride. You can do it cowboy. - This is Vince, he's the best. - That's it Vince. It's your time buddy. It's your time. Go, go, go, go. Stay on. Hold it, hold it! Yeah! Come on! Ooh, that's an official ride, folks. Eight seconds. - Yes! Bleed dry. You have done it cowboy. - Whoo! - I saw him practicing. I knew he could do it. - Yeah! - Thank you, sir, I sure do appreciate it. - Good luck. - Was that who I think it is? - I just got my first big dog sponsor. I guess my boss Shawn put in a good word for me. - He knows talent when he sees it. - You were awesome. - Thanks, buddy. - It was a great show. - Thank you so much, sir. It means the world that y'all came out. - Yeah, we wouldn't have missed it. - You know, there's a barn dance after. I would love if y'all could come out to that. Y'all ready for this? - Yes. - Well, not your average barn.
