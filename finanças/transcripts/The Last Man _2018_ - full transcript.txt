Subtitles by explosiveskull Go. Go. Go! We need to get in the car now. We need to get in and go before the girls... Johnny. Johnny. - Johnny! - We're already dead. Dead. Dead. Johnny. Kill me. Wake up! My name's Kurt Matheson. I'm 35 years old. I've lived through 12,787 days. I've had the same nightmare for the last 5,475 nights. Surviving has always been something I'm pretty good at. But I don't know how much more of this I wanna take. Kill me. I know your name. Kurt. Thousands of years of progress, and all it took was 30 days to destroy it. The world I used to know is gone. Two. Environmental disasters and a global economic fallout... - How much? - Hundred. ...sent everything into chaos. Okay. Populations decreased. People fled the cities. Western civilization collapsed in about 30 days. They called it the "Black Month." I don't understand what you are saying. Five? Get down on the ground! Shut the fuck up and get down on the ground! You fucking hear me, cocksucking motherfucker? Huh? Shut up! Shut up! Hey. Okay, Steve, we got everything. Come on. We gotta leave. Boom! Then there was the war. Long and aimless. By the time it was over, I couldn't recognize where I was. There was just too much destruction. Now, in this dust that was a city... I think if I could find a souvenir... Just to prove the world was here. You see the world around you? You all know what's happening as well as I do. I'm not a prophet. I am not a messiah. I'm just a man who sees the truth. And we are to blame. You okay? It is our fault. We are the cancer... the metastasis that corrodes our Mother Earth. The world has been exploited. The end of life on Earth is now... I saw the best minds of my generation desperate, destroyed by madness! Searching for the angry prick of drugs! You, too, over there see the truth. We sit on an arsenal of atomic weapons controlled by madmen. We choke nature with pollution and radiation. We destroy life in the name of progress. Shame on us! We have only one place to live in the cosmos, and we are poisoning it. We have an entire menu of destruction. Nuclear holocaust. Bombs are old-fashioned. Melting ice caps, which could cause a slight deviation in the Earth's axis. A slight deviation, which in turn, will set off an apocalyptic electrical storm that will burn up all the oxygen in the atmosphere. Yes! It's the end of the world! Everybody fuck! Come on! Everybody fuck! Don't touch me. - Get outta here. - We wanna hear this man. You came back? - No way! - Loser! He came back. 12,790 days. Man created time. And because of this, we suffer a paralyzing fear that no other animal endures. The fear of time running out. I remember when I was a kid, my dad kept a large jar of marbles on the bookshelf in the living room. And he said he figured he had one for every month he had left to live. On the first Sunday of every month... he'd remove one. I just keep a running tally in my head. - Can I help you? - Yeah. It doesn't work. Nothing here works. Maybe you should have a sign or something that says that. You see that sign? We can't sell military-grade equipment that works. It's all for show. Government doesn't want this shit getting into the wrong hands. Give him a refund. Yeah. Yeah, give me a refund. Why don't you pick up a book? What? Take a book. It's free. Uh, yeah, I... I don't need a book. Try this one. I wrote it myself. Hey, that's good for you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. But this, you know, it's, uh... Nah, this is of no use to me. I don't need a damn handbook. It's more than a handbook. It's a mind book. I need supplies... that work. I'm sure my employee mentioned we're limited in supplies. Who? Hippie Hansen? Yeah, he sure did. All right. I can recommend suppliers, if you'd like. Take my card. A lot of people think that the world is coming to an end. I don't think it. I know it. People chatter but do nothing about it. But it's coming, and we're going to be ready. I'm going to be damn sure that the best of our species survives. Along with myself, of course. That's funny. Call me if you like. I can help you find things that work. Come to one of our meetings. Don't worry. It's not a cult. We're just survivalists. Yeah, I've seen you out there with all those people before. I know it. Think I'll pass though. Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. Oh. That can be fixed. It's just a broken gasket. You shouldn't let a flimsy piece of rubber be the end of you. We need to learn to fix things ourselves. Study it. The book. Thanks. Got nothing but old shit in here. Where'd you find all this old shit? Don't like old shit. Why does that guy look familiar? Does he looks familiar to you? Hey, look, man. Another survivor. And I know the weirdo. How do you know that man? He was at the store that we were robbing the other night. Come on, pussy. What's up? What's up? Come on. What's wrong, eh? Is all of this necessary? Wow. Wow. Okay, okay. It's okay. Um... You have something that's ours. Um, I don't... I don't know if you're aware, but to be in this specific location, you need to pay. I don't have any money. I'm just here to help. Money will be useless soon anyway. I'm going to kill you! Come on! Nice kick, man! This ought to teach him! Thought he could actually survive! And he's got a gas mask. Come on, French. Get him up. Come on. Whoo-hoo! Where do you want to go, huh? Yeah, French, kick his ass. If money's not gonna be necessary, old fella... then why are you selling all this shit? Well, we need some to sustain all this, buy supplies, prepare our refuge in the mountains. We've spent all our money. Jesus Christ. You might be dead before you get to spend that. No one gets out from here. What the fuck, French? Man, he's just a bum! Don't do that. Don't fuckin' move, or I'll blow your brains out! Come on, man! What you gonna do? Gonna take us on, huh? I'm gonna shoot myself in the fucking mouth if you don't shut the fuck up! Goddamn it. I'd rather you not do that. Jesus Christ. Impressive. Thank you. Just come around. Come around. Come on. Let's go. Come on around. He's not gonna survive this one! Pussy. Come on! Oh, shit! Get the fuck up! We're civil people. We really are. We don't... Come on! Get up. We don't wanna hurt anybody, but, uh, you never know... where somebody might end up and, uh... Enough, please. You're going to kill him! Yeah, man. Call them off! Let's go. Come on, guys. We're done here. Yeah. Hmm? Money? Tomorrow? All of it? Hmm? Today's gonna look like a picnic. Right? Yes, yes. Yeah. I have you. I have you. You're a backstabbing... ...local storm is hitting the five counties with massive... You're dead. Kill me. We're all already dead. Kill me. ...hundreds of thousands of fatalities and billions of dollars in property damage have been reported. Do it! Hey! Don't. Don't say nothin'. Where are you? Come and help us. Come and stand on these corners. Keep up. Ghosts haunt these halls. Electrical power failures, a lack of running water, and police forces stretched to their limits... 12,792 days. Families have nothing. There was a family that died in the strong winds. We're on the verge of a health care implosion. You have to remember it was not only homes that were destroyed but doctors' offices... Emergency services have collapsed. Doctors are fighting against time and limited resources. They're leaving kids in squalor. They have no electricity. They have no communication with the outside world. This area is devastated. Kill me. Meteorologists are talking about a possible massive tsunami hitting the East Coast, and new storms and hurricanes are being discovered from one minute to the next. Weather models are forecasting winds of up to 80 miles... We must wake up. The storm... The storm is coming soon. I've spent the last 20 years traveling the world preparing people to survive. I believe my long pilgrimage ends here. The atmosphere we have relied upon for our breathing has become a hothouse of poisonous gases. There is a layer that exists between Earth and space. The charge residing in this layer measures 500,000 coulombs at any given moment. Yeah. Yeah, it does. What does that mean? An apocalyptic electrical storm that will destroy life on Earth in a blink of an eye. I need more supplies. I've nothing left to barter, so I need money. Guess I gotta look for a job. Same bullshit, even at the end of the world. Hello. You aren't dead, are you? I don't think so. What do you think? Is it true that you were a soldier? My best friend told me that you were some kind of a mad soldier. But I don't think that you're mad. Hey kid. What's your friend's name? All right, well, you want me tell you my name first? I already know your name. Kurt. My best friend told me everything about you. Oh, yeah? What's your friend's name? What do you call him? He's like you. Yeah, but what's his name? His name is Johnny. He told me that you were dead and that you were a ghost. But I don't believe in ghosts. I'm a big boy. Well, I have to go. Bye. Chap's information here. All right. What was that, darling? Well, there's still an interview for don Antonio. There's still an interview? Yeah. Okay. I forgot about that. Hey. Jessica, wait. Can I talk you about something? About what? About many things. And maybe not now because I see you are kind of... Yes, I'm kind of busy. Busy, yeah. How about later? I'm gonna be free tonight. Tonight? Well, I've... I've got stuff to do. Stuff? Yeah. But we'll talk later. Sure. Hi. Sorry for the wait. Uh, you ready? Hey. Are you there? Uh, yeah. Are you Kurt? Yeah. Yeah? Okay, come in. Follow me. You need some ice for that? Oh. No. No? Sure? Yeah. It's nothing. You nervous? I'm okay. Good. Just don't let him intimidate you. Okay. Come. Sorry, Daddy. The last candidate is here. Ah. Have a seat, kid. Jessica. Sure. I'm gonna get to the point. I have read your résumé, and I think you are what I am looking for. Clean background. Engineering experience. Great. I just need someone to maintain the place. And I think you'll do fine. Kid, do you speak, or what? Yes, sir. Yeah, when I have to. Oh. I like that. Good. Uh, 'cause, for a second, I thought you were a mute. And, you know, I couldn't handle a fucking mute. It's... It's fucking freaky. You know what I'm saying? Yes, sir. Yeah, good. So... what am I not seeing? What do you mean? Don't play dumb with me, kid. I saw your résumé. It's great. But I feel like you're leaving something out. Why don't you tell me? Just... What is it? Nothing. I run a security company. That means I have access to all kinds of information about anyone who walks through that door. Yeah, sure. I like your service record. I seen it. Listen. I know, most of the companies, they don't want to hire a combat veteran. But, personally, I don't think it's bad. As a matter of fact, it could help me out. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Okay. Sorry, Daddy. Nobody knock on the door. ¿Qué pasa? Gomez. He wants me to tell you that he's waiting to finish the thing you talked about earlier. He was just here. The thing. Yeah. Like it's some state secret. Jessica. Por favor. Sure. Sorry, Daddy. Ah. I'm leaving now. I got stuff to do anyway. I know this place is not the best for a girl, but at least, you know, I can have her close. For me, my family come first. Do you have family? No, unfortunately not. Oh. Sorry to hear that. Anyway, as you can see, if I don't solve problems here, nobody does. If you bring me solutions, you've got the job. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Is it a deal? Yeah, absolutely. That's fantastic. No, that... that's great. Thank you. Go with Jessica, and she will get you through all of the paperwork. All right? All right. Thank you. Hey, kid. Kid. You know, shave. Just, you know, get yourself clean. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. No problem. - All right. All right. Hey, thank you again. No problem. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. I go to bed, and then I wake up underneath it. 5,481 nights with the same dream. The same fire and blood and death... over and over. Because they know that this system can fall! And we have the energy to fight this today, tomorrow, and the next day. Public debt stands around $73 billion. 80 percent of the city as covered in water, so... Four million people died. A systemic failure of the government. We have gone on strike. We have also engaged in acts of civil disobedience. The economy has been stagnant for more than a decade. That means it hasn't grown. The storm's lasting effects, not just on the city's geography and infrastructure, but on... Morning, sunshine. Hey, how many times are you gonna fucking shoot at me? I was just trying to find some milk for my coffee. What, you got no milk? It's good to see you, pal. Johnny? Hey, you know, the kitchen looks good. Needs a little bit of upkeep, but easy fix. Fuck! What? I was just kidding, man. No, it can't be. No, no, it is. Give me a hug. It's good to see you. - All right, who the fuck are you? - Hey, hey. Hey. You better answer real quick, buddy. Put the fucking gun down. Put the fucking gun down. My front door's locked. How the fuck did you get in here? Hey, look at me. I want you to put the gun down. It's me. It's me. It's Johnny. It's impossible. No, no, no. Put it down. Hey, hey, it's fine. Now come here. Come here. Got to the door and into my car by the time the husband even gets to the door. And then I was peeling off, and he was chasing after me down the street in his stupid fucking suit. You know, this is shit. I hate this song. It's progress though, huh? You know, what the fuck happened to this city, by the way? I go away for a while, I come back, and all of a sudden, it's... I can't even speak English to people. It's like the goddamn Tower of Babel. Yeah, a lot of people left. Lighten up, old man, huh? What the fuck's going on? Aren't you the guy who posted up on top of a fucking mountain? For three days, three nights, you didn't eat, you didn't sleep. You just took out an entire fuckin' battalion all by yourself. I don't get it, man. I mean... How are you here? No, man. You died. I shot you. I... I put a bullet in you myself. I made you. I fuckin' made it out, man. Medevac unit found me the next day. I woke up in the hospital, three days and ten fuckin' blood transfusions later, to the ugliest goddamn nurse I've ever seen, by the way. She looked like a fuckin' horse. I swear to God. Oh, you should've been there, man. So, listen to me. This is what I want you to do. This is some sage advice, all right? I want you to stop all this crybaby bullshit. Huh? I want you to go out there. I want you to find yourself some fuckin' tail. My God. You must have some hot little secretary at work, okay? Some little floozy on the side? Do you even work? I'm taking off. Good talk. See you around? Yeah, I'll see you around. Hey. Hey. Were you talking to some little kid about me? Hmm. 12,793 days... and this is my first on the new job. ...of SOS, Save Our Planet. Shut up, I need to print this. Do it now. Is it ready? Yes. I'm finishing. ...thousands take to the streets to demand an economy that works for people and the planet. I need to check this. A world safe from the ravages of climate change, a world with good jobs... It seems okay. ...clean air and water, and healthy communities. Hey, what are you doing here in the basement? I'm, uh... You know, I'm still trying to learn the building. But I can't figure out what this door is to. You can't be here. See the No Trespassing sign? Yeah, it's just... The door is not on the blueprints, so I can't make any sense of it. Yeah, that's for me and Antonio. Okay? Move on. Move on. Hey! Hey! Hey! You feeding him? You can't feed him. You need to get him out of here. Is he bothering you? He is a vagrant. Fuckin' British! Well, it's my house. Yeah, well, it's my fuckin' neighborhood. And I don't want that hanging around here, pissing on the sidewalks. Hey. Hey, are you listening to me? Hey, I'm talking to you. - Are you listening to me? - K urt. Listen to me. Hey. I'm fuckin' talking to you, you fucking prick. Hey. I knew your parents. They were good people. There were never any problems when they were around. Now I've got all this to fucking deal with. Hey! Hey. What's your problem, you prick? We must build shelter... gather food, arm ourselves. We have to disappear from society. No trace. Close our bank accounts, cancel our credit cards. Get rid of all the material goods that are not needed in our real lives. Not depend on technology or electrical power. Only in this way we'll be strong enough to endure the apocalypse. Sweet, huh? No, come on. Can't you see her boobs are fake? They look real to me. But they are not. Okay, let's go. I mean, Gomez will kill us, okay? Okay. You're officially a pussy. She's a grown-up woman, okay? This is legal. I might be a pussy, but I'll keep my job and my life, so close that up. What eye are you using, man? Look at this cuerpo. I'm leaving. Go, go, go. Get out of here, you pussy. Hey, new guy, come here. Check this out. Don't be maricón. Here. Huh? What are you doing at my computer? Huh? We were just... Oh, my God! - We were just looking. - What the fuck? Yeah, just looking. What's your problem? Get your ass out of here. God, I'm so embarrassed. You know, these pictures are kind of old, and... What is this? Do you believe in this stuff? What are we listening for? There's no birds. It's like they all left. There are never birds around here. Can I ask you a question? Why not a triangle or a square? Oh, you mean... Yeah, the circle on your neck. I like circles. Sure, me too, but... what's-what's the meaning? Emptiness. That's how I mostly feel. I guess my life is pretty hollow. Well, you know, it's also the number zero... which is like a starting point. You know, the zero point, it represents potential and growth. It's... It's like the embryo. You know who that guy is down there? The one talking to Gomez? Mm-hmm. No. You must be careful with Gomez. Oh, yeah? Why's that? He does Daddy's dirty work. Hey. Haven't you turned on the generator yet? I'm gonna get a coffee. Great. I'm sorry. What was your question? The generator. We have a generator? The power goes out, the generator gets turned on. It's your job to make that happen, Mr. Maintenance. Copy that. Be careful there with the boss's daughter. Don't get the wrong idea. You can look, but you can't touch. I'm watching you. Yeah, sure. Move on, smart guy. Darkness lurks everywhere. And every shadow has a face. When you look into darkness, darkness looks into you. Hey. I fuckin' know you. You're the faggot from last time. You shaved your beard, but you're still a faggot. I've been thinking about you. And looking for you too. I was thinking about how... last time, I should have fucking blown your brains out. I let you live. Yeah, fucking lunacy. So I'm glad I fucking ran into you, man. Yeah. Yeah. Baby-faced motherfucker. What... No, man! It just feels like the same fire and blood and death. I have to be prepared. Do not doubt your strength. If you fail the test, I will test it again. We must all be strong together. One alone does not work. How can one alone repopulate the planet? Oh. Hello. They're decorating now too, huh? You know, I need to do something about them before it's too late. Well, at least they are consistent. This is the only way they see to get attention. No, that's crazy. People like that, you know, they never change, man. They're like hungry dogs. They may be in denial. And you? You are the reluctant hero of course. I get it. You've been through hell. And self-destruction is a hell of a lot easier than taking responsibility. Make yourself healthy. Try it. We are leaving in three days. Come. Come with us. No. And find yourself a girl, for God's sake. Hey! There's one now. Good to see you. What... What are you doing here? I was looking for you. Just a joke. What's going on? Did I interrupt? Hey, uh, Noe, do you know Jessica? Jessica, this is Noe. Yes, I know him. He's the preacher. What's happening? Did you somehow plan this, preacher? I'm not a preacher. Do you mind if I stay? Course not. You see the world around you. You all know what's happening as well as I do. The only law in times like this is the law of survival. And survival means preparation. In the coming storm, there will be those who will fall prey to their bodies, others who will be like terrified animals. We must remain lucid and be prepared for the worst of humanity. A nuclear world war will be catastrophic, not only for the direct deaths that could ensue but also due to the collapse of certain... I told you. He leaves now. If you don't deal with it, then I'm gonna... Take it. Keep him off my property. I feel like the end is nearly upon us. I can't explain it, but it's almost a relief. A lot of media commentators are speaking about the possibility of a war breaking out, and have contemplated the use of nuclear weapons sent against civilian populations. Thank you so much for the time that you've spent with us in this. Now... millions march decrying police violence. 12,795 days. People don't understand what's coming. Still going about their lives in denial. I gotta finish my bunker as soon as possible. Well, this is fucking insane. I mean... What the fuck is this? What the hell are you even doing here? Preparing. Preparing? For what, the apocalypse? And why? Because some moody old man says so? A fucking scammer? Kurt, can't you just tell he's acting the whole time? You know what they should do? They should give him an Academy Award. You have any idea how crazy all this shit looks? Dude. I know things have been tough. I know that. But they're looking up. You got a girl, you got a job. Why not just see how things turn out? You don't understand. Damn fuckin' right I don't understand. Who would? Listen to me. Kurt, you're destroying the house where you grew up. Do you hear me? Stop what you're doing. Listen to me for a second. Hey. Listen to me. You sold the couch on which your old man died. Okay? The one where he waited for you to come home, and everybody told him that you were killed in the war. He never believed that. And one day, you show up. What were his last words, Kurt? "Brave. You must be brave." Yo. Don't you ever talk about my father again. You understand me? Come on, buddy. You cannot ignore the fact that you come home from the war, you lose your dad the next day and your mom two months later. It's a huge burden for a 19-year-old boy, don't you think? Honestly, if you're asking me, none of this shit makes any sense. I think you're fucking cracking, buddy. I really think you are. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What's that? Okay. Okay, a drink! Whoo! Let's have a drink. You and me, like old times, okay? Let's do this. No, no, no. What... What are you doing? No! Oh, Kurt... Are you fucking kidding me? That's, you know... It's official. You've lost it, man. You're a lunatic. Actually... things are finally making sense. Oh, are they? Yeah. And speaking of, what's your deal with this kid that keeps roaming around my house? You talked to him about me? What the fuck are you talking about? Which kid? You know, a little kid. Like, yay tall. Creepy as fuck. Okay, I'll try to keep an eye out for him. Yeah, do that. What the fuck are even you doing? You gonna get that? Shh. Kurt, are you there? Hi. Do me a favor, would ya? Fucking stop doing that. Oh, come on! Are you sure you wanna let her in? Kurt, it's me, Jessica. You know... - Fuck off! - What? Tear down one of these walls, fresh coat of paint, and you got a lovely little bachelor pad. Kurt! It's me! Open up. I know you're there. Fuck! I can hear you. For Christ's sake. Oh, yeah, definitely cover these up. Yeah, there you go. Hey, aren't you forgetting something? Kurt, what are you doing? There you go. Open the door. Usually, I like to ask a girl to dinner before showing her my bunker. Please, man, shut up. It's a penis joke. - Just open the fucking door! - Also, just a detail. Might wanna take off that creepy fucking mask. All right. Go now! - All right, I'm going. - Please, Johnny, go! Fuck. Johnny, be good. Jesus, Kurt, I know you're in there. Open up. Jesus. Where have you been? You're making my dad nervous. Home. What the fuck? - You sleep in here? - Uh-huh. There's trouble, Kurt. Money's gone missing. A lot of money. - So? - So? So I overheard my father and Gomez. Daddy was raving, throwing around accusations. It was a lot of money, Kurt. A lot. And in the middle of it, Gomez mentioned your name. Okay. "Okay"? So? So. Jesus, Kurt. Look at this place. Huh? What is this? What the fuck is this? What are you doing here? Are you building a fortress? Kurt. If you took the money... we can fix this. Okay? I didn't take the money. Swear to me. Swear that you didn't take it. Come on, Kurt. I need the truth, you know? Swear to me. I need to know. Swear to me. Yeah, I swear. I promise. Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm. You really do? I promise. You sure? Yeah? Swear to me. Swear it. Yeah? Yeah, all this stuff I paid for myself. Yeah? Are you sure? You're not lying to me? No, I'll never lie to you. What's that? It's nothing. It's nothing. No? So, when was the last time you had a woman? Long time. Could you tell? Yeah, right. Just... You're not a very good liar. No, it was just very... very intense. I mean, I like to be wanted. This feels different though. Do I scare you? Well... You did sell all of your furniture... spent all of your savings, and turned your house into a bunker. You're pretty special. Go open that closet right there. Hmm? There's a false door behind that shelf. Go open it up. You serious? Yeah. You gotta open up the hatch. What is this? It's okay. There's no monsters down there. - So? - She's been there for an hour. Kid's got some serious fucking pelotas. Bangin' the boss's daughter after stealing him? You think she helped him take the money? I'm not paid to speculate. - What do we do then, boss? - We wait in the car. That's some setup down there. There's not enough water for two. You plan on joining me? Unless you want me to fend for myself in the wasteland. No, I mean... I don't wanna die out there alone. You can't tell anybody about this. Sure. I won't tell. No one. Absolutely no one. Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. Nobody ever listens to me anyway. Yeah. Not even my dad. He doesn't take me seriously. I'm just his little doll, you know? Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm dumping a lot on you, aren't I? I should have saved daddy issues for the third date. Anyway, I... I haven't told them where you live. But they will find you, Kurt. And Gomez is very dangerous, you know? I can handle him. Let me ask you a question. Don't take it personal, okay? Shut up, you moron. She's leaving now. Okay, I'll follow her, boss. Wait. Keep a distance. She's not stupid. It's been reinforced. - Check the window. - Yeah. There's a metal plate behind the glass. What? It's a fucking fortress. Listen, kid. We just want to ask you a few questions. That's all. Oh, please, don't make this worse than it has to be. Now, listen to me, you stupid shit. I know you took the money, and I'm gonna get it back. This could mean a civil bloody conversation over a cup of tea... or I end up nailing your goddamn kneecaps to the floor, remembering the good old days, right? Go back to the car. Okay, boss. Or maybe... just maybe... it means I pay a little visit to your girlfriend. Oh, fuck, I know she's the boss's daughter. But then, he'd never know. I could make sure he never knew. Oh, poor daddy. The fucking things I could do to that little, tiny, tight, maybe-not-so-wet cooze. Guess you're in deep shit. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, don't give me that look. Don't give me that look. I told you not to listen to that prophet. I told you building a fuckin' bunker was twisted, not to mention what it does to the resale value of your house. You wanna barricade yourself from the world, but you may as well draw a fucking target on your chest, 'cause these guys are real. Kurt, listen to me. Hey, hey, hey. You're trading your heroes for ghosts. That's a line from a song, yeah? Yeah. I thought it sounded good for a bit of drama. Sounded better in my head though. Great song though, right? Hey, hey. No, no. Where are you going with that? To help a friend. Look, Kurt. You have to worry about yourself, bro. You gotta get your life back. Okay? I'm serious. That's ironic coming from you. Shine on, you crazy diamond. I got a million of 'em. 12,796 days. Storms are constant. Tonight, Noe and his flock... Come on! ...make their pilgrimage to the mountains. I can't go with them. I'm on my own. But maybe I can help see 'em off. The army took kids... put guns in their hands... Oh, shit. ...and told them what to shoot. Where is the old cunt? This is different. Going somewhere, old fella? I don't think that's gonna happen. What do you want? Money? Night's come for you, old man. What? Oh. Oh, you think we're bargaining now? Now? Okay, okay. Give us all the fucking money you have on your fucking bus, and maybe, maybe, if we feel fucking charitable, we won't torture your followers before we kill 'em. What do you think, your swastika is going to make your skin tougher? It's still gonna bleed when it's cut, and it will freeze when it's cold. You piece-of-shit Jew. I knew you'd pull this shit! Let's do plan B. That's where we burn you all alive! No! No! See, old man? See your piece-of-shit friend? Look. Now get us the fucking money, you old kike! What's it gonna be, you stinking kike? Ain't nobody up there gonna help you now. Move, motherfuck... What the fuck? There's someone out there. - Get the fuck back. - Watch him. What's happening now? What's going on? - He... He came back. - Where is he? He came back! Shut the fuck up! Get the fuck out! Move out. I'm tired of you, man. Everything you do is wrong. You have no clue. No clue. You don't even know what's coming. Get the fuck out of here. I choke on familiar dread. I'm terrified. And not because of the storms on the horizon. Not because I reject Noe's salvation. But because of how easy it was to kill again. Ventilation system with radiation-cleaning mechanism. Water tank with filtration system. 2.5 liters hydration pack. Chlorine tablets. Activated-charcoal tablets. Light source supported by a clean dynamo generator. Baking soda. Isopropyl alcohol. Hydrogen peroxide. Sterile supply of gauze and wraps. Antibiotic ointment. Surgical stapler. Suture kit. Lensatic compass. Shortwave radio and satellite phone. Very high density protein food. Nuts and dried meat. Canned food. Stay away from heavily flavored or salted nuts. The amount of salt present in the unsalted nut mixes is still sufficient enough... to replace electrolytes. Well, you were right. What an apocalyptic fucking storm. And all over the world too. It's unbelievable. You awake? First storm you sleep through since the war, and it's... the biggest one of all time. If you were awake, you'd find that fucking hilarious. 12,797 days. Kurt, please open up. Brave. You must be brave. Welcome... to your new life. This... is your new family. Oh. Fresh meat? Fresh meat? Fresh meat! Hey! Hey! Hey you, new guy! Do you hear me? You're mine! Go back to your cell! Go back to your cell! Go back to your... You're mine! Do you hear me? You're mine! You're mine! Go back to your cell! You're mine! You fresh meat! You're mine! You can't escape me! You can't escape me! Shut up! Shut up! I'm gonna get you! I don't know how many days it's been. And that's a problem for someone like me. I know where I am though. This is where people get put when they need to be forgotten. There's something wrong with me. But I don't think I'm crazy. Not like this. But then I feel the warmth... of the sun. Kurt, are you aware of the seriousness of your situation? Probably not. Your file states a long history of panic disorder, suicidal tendencies, possible dissociative disorder. You were in treatment for PTSD, but you stopped. And now... Murder charges. Your house was searched. The police found your... shelter. Ah. Hello. What they found is not the home of a healthy man. I can help you, Kurt. But you have to work with me. The police report indicated that you'd become involved with a man named Noe. A self-fashioned doomsday prophet. His real name is Allen Green. He was arrested and convicted twice in the United States for fraud since moving here. He's a con man, Kurt. Not a prophet. You are sick, and you've been clinging to the ravings of a false prophet to reinforce your beliefs. The world is not ending. What about the storms? Yes, the scope was historic, record-breaking. But we are talking about the records of only 100 years. That's a drop in the bucket of the history of our planet. Something is changing. But there is no more evidence to suggest we are on the verge of a sudden, cataclysmic ending than there is to indicate we are not. And the storms have ended. In your case, after the trauma you've experienced, these kinds of delusions are common. In fact, they are exactly what men like Allen Green feed on. Now I'm going to go through a checklist with you, and I need you to answer honestly. First. Have you experienced any audio or visual hallucinations? Kurt, are you listening to me? It's important. Have you experienced any audio or visual hallucinations? Don't listen to him. He's just asking you these questions to hear himself speak. Kurt. Tell him what you did. Tell him about the three nights on the mountain. Tell him how many men you killed. Tell him what we did together. It's you and me against the world, buddy. I'm sure you oughta know that by now. He's not gonna be easy to crack. 'Cause he's fucking insane. I was robbed by a fucking madman. How the hell am I supposed to recover my money now? We have our people turning the house upside down. If it's in there, we'll find it. Give me some time. We have to use a task force that doesn't involve us. Dead men are not useful for me. I want my money first. And then you can do whatever you want. I told you, I don't have a fucking lawyer. Shut the fuck up, loony! He's over there. How you doing? What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost. No. No, not a ghost. Allen Green. Not a ghost. Definitely not a prophet. Nothing special really. Just... Just a professional hustler, yeah? Allen Green. You know, I can't believe I actually bought into your bullshit. What are you doing here anyways? I thought you'd be off in the mountains by now, like, hiding in a little cave or something. Unfortunately, after the incident in the park, the police confiscated our bus and all the supplies on it. I myself had to go into hiding. The reason for the disguise. Oh. Well, that's... that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. What will you do? How will you survive? Oh, right, yeah, I forgot. You're a fucking survivalist. You saved our lives. Unfortunately, the men you killed work for powerful people. Those guys collect money for the guy you robbed. And to them, I'm as guilty as you are. I didn't steal money from anyone. How much money did you scam off all the people that believed in you? I never scammed anybody, Kurt. Storms are over, all right? They're done. And I'm in here, stuck in a fucking loony bin. But you know what? This place is not so bad. The storms are not done, Kurt. We're just in the eye of the hurricane. It's a bit clinical maybe. But, you know, what they lack in design... they really make up for in service. You listen to me. The storms are not over. This is merely the calm before the storm. These are the end of days, Kurt, the end of days. You were destined for more than this. Don't do this to yourself. Don't do it. Who told you these things? Who told you these things about me? That was in another life. Forget it. I think it was that girl you were seeing, her father. Forget it. It's bullshit. You saved our lives, you understand me? You saved our lives. You stood up. You showed up. You showed who you really were. Don't give it up now. Don't sink back into that place. You are my hero. Fuck everybody else. Fuck them. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay? Calm down. I'm gonna calm down too. Okay. Okay, get a grip. You get a grip. Come on. Come on. You get a grip. You're mine! You're mine! Do you hear me, fresh meat? You're mine! You're mine! Do you hear me, fresh meat? You're mine! - You're my fucking fresh meat! - Shut the fuck up! Allen Green, where are the storms? Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Huh? Huh? 1,000 volts, motherfucker. You killed Romhess, didn't you? Yeah. Gomez told us all about that shit, you sick fuck. Get the fuck down! Get on your fucking knees. Get on your fucking knees, man! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Fuck you, faggot! Fuckin'... Yeah. Come on! Thomas. You're fucking sweet... Fuck you. Fucking nigger. ...blond ass... ...is mine. I'm gonna fucking kill you. Fucking kike. I ain't no fucking faggot! You are so lucky. Your lawyer pulled some strings, so I could get you out of here. But the deal is only good for today. So, if I see you here tomorrow, you are my new pet! Ooh! A Nazi. Always wanted me one of them for a pet. Now get the fuck out of here! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait. I'm here to help. The guards out front, they're switching over. There's room for you to leave, but you have to go now. So what, you're... you're a double agent now? Needed a new line of work. Uh, here, for you. What's this? It's from the preacher, a change of clothes. You'll never get out of here wearing the stuff you are now. That's a satellite phone. Something about the satellite still being functional a while after the final storm. But you have to leave now, okay? Please. Quick. All right, thanks. Don't thank me. Thank the preacher. You know where he is? He's getting ready to leave. He said I should join him after he's gone. But... Wait. Hit me. What? Don't fuck around, okay? You know those guys. They'll kill me. Fuck. They found my shelter. But, thank God, not the bunker. Are you fucking kidding me? How the fuck could he escape from that facility? Tell the police to not do anything until I tell them. We'll take care of this. Listen, Gomez, there's something else. I'm putting you in charge of security detail for Jessica. I am worried about her getting tangled up in this. Keep that nutjob away from her. I don't care what she thinks about this. You just do what I command. You can't just let it go, can you? Look at you. You know, maybe she left. Maybe she gave up on you. I don't know. Or maybe she was in on it. Who knows? But you know what? You're gonna go out there, you're gonna fucking get yourself killed. These guys are fucking dangerous, Kurt. Do you not see that? You're fucking walking into a suicide and you won't even look at me. Hey! Look at me! You don't have to put that coat on, okay? Don't put that coat... You know what we have to do? Even if the world doesn't end, you could use a vacation. So what say you and me, we go into the mountains, all right? We have a fucking break of our own. I'm sorry, Johnny. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. Bye, Johnny. Hey. Well, see you around? Yeah, on the dark side of the moon. ...are forecasting winds of up to 80 miles an hour and 60 inches of drenching rain over the next 24 hours, like a world record. The emergency services have advised taking shelter and keeping informed. This weather is totally out of control, and there will be more around the corner. Jessica told me she didn't want to die alone in the cold. Neither do I. What are you doing here? You have to go! He waited for you while everyone was telling him that you were killed in war. But he never believed that. Until one day, you showed up. Brave. You must be brave. My daddy told me that. It's just a matter of time, boss. He's a lonely puto. Yes. If you give us just one more day, we'll get him. Where's Jessica? Fucking great. I have paid half of the fucking city to look for you, and you just fucking waltz in my door. Look. Nice. I really like your daughter, okay? So I don't want to have to shoot you. Oh. You do love my daughter, huh? Yes, sir. And I need to know where she is right now. Shit happens. Don't fuck around! So, here you are, you sick fuck. Calm down, Gomez. Don't shoot. Where's Jessica? That's right. Where the fuck is she? You're supposed to be watching her. Yeah, yeah. But let me kill this bloody thief first. I'm not a thief. All right? I didn't take your money. I'm gonna reach into my pocket now, okay? Hey, hey, don't move. Don't move. Hey. Hey! Let him talk. I want you to hear your friend here talk. You might have some questions for him after. Or maybe, just maybe, it means I pay a little visit to your girlfriend. Oh, fuck, I know she's the boss's daughter. But then, he'd never know. I could make sure he never knew. Oh, poor daddy. The fucking things I could do to that little, tiny, tight, maybe-not-so-wet cooze. Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on. You fucking robbed me! Come on! You saw the security camera video. He was sneaking by the vault door. He took the bloody money. Wait! There's a reasonable explanation for everything. What is it? Just tell me. Come on. It was just a tactic. I was working him over. Look at him. I mean, a guy like that... What the fuck are you... Fuck. Hey, kid. Find my daugh... You ever wonder how different life would be if certain things never happened? You know, the things that you don't want. And you gotta accept things you don't want to know but you gotta learn. From our beginning, it was clear that we were new. Power we held, and it grew. Until it grew out of control. And now we're gliding towards the end. All I've ever done is survive. And maybe that's all anyone ever does. Until you don't. And then, what dreams may come? "Visions, omens, hallucinations, miracles, ecstasies... gone down the American river. Dreams, adorations, illuminations, religions. The whole boatload of sensitive bullshit. Breakthroughs... over the river. Flips and crucifixions... gone down the flood. Highs, epiphanies, despairs. Ten years' animal screams and suicides. Minds, new loves. Mad generation down on the rocks of time. Real holy laughter in the river. They saw it all... the wild eyes, the holy yells. They bade farewell. They jumped off the roof to solitude, waving, carrying flowers. Down to the river, into the street." "In my dreams, you walk dripping from a sea journey on the highway across America in tears to the door of my cottage in the Western night." Shh. Shh-shh. It's okay. It's okay.
