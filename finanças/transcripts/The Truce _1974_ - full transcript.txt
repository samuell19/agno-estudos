TRUCE -Good morning. -Good morning, Dad. -Good morning. -Did you have a good time yesterday? -As usual. -And you? -I went to the club with my friends. -What did you do? -Nothing. -Sundays are very boring to you, aren't they? -Yes. -Good morning. -What are you doing here so early? They changed my shift this week. Come here, Blanca. What are they up to? -Hey. -Yes? -What are they up to? -I don't know. Remember the champagne. Don't forget. -Have they paid you? -No, not yet. -Do you need money? -No. -It's just to remind me I owe him money. -That's right. Jaime, Julio wanted to know if his belt was ready. You' re working for your loafer friends again. You' re a jerk. -You know what they call guys like you? -No. But I know... -...what they call guys like your friends. -You starting again?! -What do you care if he makes a belt for a friend? -Friend?! -They just take advantage of him. -Mind your own business! -Do I mess with your friends? -They' re not like your friends. What do you mean? Don't make me talk. It's not advisable for you. Your son talks like a gangster. He utters threats with suspense. -Do you have a cigarette? -There you have. -Look at your face. Someone died? -lt' s my 49th birthday. Today? Oh man! We have to celebrate. Shut up! What do I have to celebrate? -You' ll celebrate with your family? -No. My sons and daughter forgot my birthday. It's better that way. So? Let' s go and have fun. I got a girl for you. She's great. -Robledo, do you have lbanez's file? -Yes, l' ll look for it. 1 1 were right. It's the second time. I' ll have a heart attack. Speaking of football pools, Loco hasn't come. Maybe he won it. Martin! Martin! How do you do? Wait! -Martin! Martin San Tome! -Asshole! How are you? I' m so happy. Give me a hug. -Don't you remember me? Vignale. -Oh, Vignale. -Where were you going? -To have lunch. Just there. -l' ll go with you. We have to celebrate. -And your car? Yes, it's okay! Come on, let's go. I' m so happy! My monthly net profit is 3 million, 3 million and a half. Your food was good, uh? We couldn't go to that joint. -What will you have? -Coffee. Coffee? No, have a drink. -OK, bring me a brandy. -And a whisky for me. A small one. You' re really something! You were always like that. You were always so discreet. I used to have lunch... ...at your house every day. Your mother was a great cook. You had lunch at home every day? I don't remember that. Well... So to speak. But I did it often. Everyone in your family spoke in a low voice. The Vignales speak in a loud voice. We' re very cheerful. I talked about my business and didn't ask about your children. -They must be grown-ups. How many do you have? -3. Esteban is 26,... ... Blanca 23 and Jaime 20. My children are younger. I was older when I got married. I really had fun. You were very young when you got married. You fell in love when you were a kid. Isabel was beautiful. -How is she? -lsabel is dead. What? She's dead? You serious? No, l' m sorry, I know you' re serious. That's so unfortunate. -When did it happen? -20 years ago. 20 years ago! And you haven't married again. It's as if you were single. So many years... You like freedom, don't you? -lf you' ll excuse me, I gotta go back to work. -Sure. Let's meet again. Come home, you' ll meet my family... -...and l' ll show you some photos. -What photos? -Are you nuts? It' s my treat. Our photos when we were kids. I'd like that. How can we do that? Here' s my number. Give me yours, l' ll call you. I don't have a card. I' ll write it here. Call me at the office. I' m always there. Clavacho! One of these days you' ll win the football pools. I know what l' m talking about. You' ll win some day. You' re kidding me.But I guessed 9 right answers this week. -l' m getting closer. -Mendez guessed 1 1 right answers. -1 1? -And for the second time. He's a winner. Yes, he's a winner. But he hits incredible scores. I hate people who choose any result and win. It's a matter of luck. And if we all gather some money and play together? -Do you think so? -There' s nothing to lose. Okay, but we' ll do it in an organized way. One of us will be in charge of the ticket every week. Everyone will have his week. If I don't write it, I don't wanna know the answers. It makes me nervous. The manager asked me to introduce the 2 new employees... ...of this department. Miss Laura Avellaneda, Mr. Alfredo Santini. -Nice to meet you. -You won't introduce me? -Robledo. Give me the file. -Allow me. -Have a seat. -Thanks. -Excuse me. Miss Avellaneda, due to your experience it' ll be advisable... ...for you to work in the calculation of increase in sales. -It's more difficult but it's not so boring. -Okay, sir. -What's wrong? Are you scared? -A little. It's the first time I work in a large company. Large? We no longer think that. Mr. Santini,... -... you know the system we use in our stock books. -Yes, sir. Is there any chance for me to work facing a window? I' m claustrophobic. -Facing a window? -I wouldn't want to upset you the first day... ... but it's a psychic problem. A trauma. Yes, don't worry. -Mendez! -Yes? -You have the desks keys, right? -Yes, sir. -Robledo, the lady will work here. -That sounds great. Give her the locker keys. Tell Sanchez to give her... ...the production books. You' ll work here. Give Mr. Santini a desk facing the back window. -Facing the window? -l' m claustrophobic. I' m sorry. -Really sorry. -There's nothing to be sorry about. Mendez, come. Come, l' ll introduce you to your workmates. Martinez. A woman at last! -Hi. -Nice to meet you. This claustrophobia thing must be terrible for you. It's psychosomatic. But facing it does not cure it. Oh, Sierra, excuse me. Avellaneda, Santini, our football pools expert. -You' re a Leo. -What? -Your birthday? -August 20th. Didn't I tell you? A typical Leo. -Why typical? -Games of chance are irresistible for Leos. He can make our horoscope. Let's check. Ibanez. Yes, lbanez. Pretty girl, isn't she? How old is she? -24. -She's not a girl. No? Then I am Tutankhamen. No, why? What does it have to do? Nothing. But age is not a good topic of conversation today. -Did you find it? -Yes. Ibanez and Company... ... 200 spark plugs. -Happy birthday to you! -Happy birthday, Dad. -Thanks. -What's wrong? -I thought you'd forgotten. -Okay, let's have dinner. I' m starving. -What's that face? To your places! -What's that? A present for me? -I don't know. From the three of you? -Let's see. -Let's see. -This is a luxury robe. -You like it? -l' ll be ashamed to wear it. -You deserve more than this. -Hold it. I' ll try it on. -Give me your jacket. -You' re so elegant. -It's too much. -Let me see. Here... -How do I look? Great. You look like me. You' re not ugly at all. You look really handsome. -Really? -You look great. When I quit my job, I put it on and l' ll never take it off. -And l' ll have dinner with the robe on! -Very good! Yes! -You' re planning to quit your job next year? -Sure. I can't believe you' re sick and tired of working. What are you going to do at home all day long? How do you know l' m gonna be locked at home all day long? She divides the world into 2: The happy people who work... ...in an office and the unhappy ones who stay home... -...taking care of their family. -That's a lie. I never said that. Don't start to argue. Let's make a toast to me. What do you think about that? -Do I have to make it? -No, of course not. I hope you have a nice evening with your children. -Cheers. -Amen. Today I ran into an old friend of my childhood. He talked for an hour. At first I couldn't remember who he was. Didn't he tell you his name? Yes, Vignale. He said it right away. But I couldn't remember him. And I remember all my friends. Poor guy! When he asked about Mom, he felt terrible. -He knew Mom? -Yes. -He remembered her? -Sure. -l' m happy for him. I don't remember her. -I do. Excuse me. If you' re gonna talk to me, make up your mind. Skinny women get more wrinkles with age. My younger sister was thinner. Now she looks older than me. She hates that. She doesn't say anything but she hates it. I can't stop thinking. I' m always thinking about something. I can't even read because l can't keep anything in my head,... ...I' m thinking about something else. It's the same when I sew. -And my parcel? Where's my parcel? -There it is. My customer must be waiting for it. I' m a great sewer but I don't like it. It' s the same with everything. Being locked up at home. My husband gets mad when I tell him I hate the house. It's easy for him. He's at the shop all day long seeing people. He tells me to watch TV. Are you a banker? -No, why? -But you keep accounts at work. Sometimes. Why? You make that face in bed. -l' m sorry. -That' s the street. At least he should pretend. He doesn't work, he' s always late, he cuts work. They' ll make you sub-manager by the end of the year, l' m sure. But if you' re quitting, he' ll be the sub-manager. There's a whole year ahead of us. He won't be here that long. Show me those glasses. Excuse me. They really suit! You must wear them all the time. You wear them in the street? 406-6 from June 7th to June 1 4th... ... 237 thousand pesos. 425-9 from August 1 5th to August 22nd... ... 1 13 thousand pesos. Santini. Santini. Santini! I' m sorry. I was absent-minded. Yes, I realized that. Tell me, Santini. Are you sure... ...that a refined guy like you likes a job like this one,... -...a job you' re not interested in? -l' m interested in my job. I think the claustrophobia doesn't let you focus. Sierra told me you' re an expert in signs of the Zodiac. Do that. You could have a section in a magazine. I just got distracted. It doesn't mean l' m useless. No! Nobody said that. But I think you don't like your job. Perhaps you'd like another job. Why are you kidding me?! Do you like this kind of life?! Are you happy with this routine?! Haven't you ever imagined you' re somewhere else... ...Ieading another life, doing something better than writing... ...numbers in papers that nobody reads?! Jerks! Wouldn't you like to be millionaires, artists,... ... handsome?! Are you happy with this miserable life?! What's wrong, Santini? Why are you shouting? -l' m sorry... -It's our fault. We were kidding him. I' m sorry, Santini. Why don't you calm down and work for a change? Listen, Suarez, did you solve Avellaneda's problem? I can't work miracles with so many people. We've been working overtime for two weeks and... ...it's your section's fault. If you have a formula for... ...not working, use it, but don't fuck with me or my people! I've been making calculations. When I retire, I'd have saved... ... enough money to live on for 3 years and 2 months. With a few accountings or gigs a year, l' ll... ...earn enough money to live on for 5 years and 2 months. Can't you talk about anything else? You've only worked for a over a year, and you' re sick of it. It shouldn't surprise you after 35 years doing the same job. Have you thought what you' re going to do? I don't know. Other than that, l' ll just think of something. Right now all I want to do is loaf about. We' ll see. I've never had enough time for me. But l' ll just waste time,... ... not what I do in the office,... ... stupid calculations nobody cares about. As Santini says. He's right. -Who's Santini? -A new worker. -He's kind of weird. -Weird? He's... ... effeminate. He had an attack today. He started to shout at Robledo and Mendez,... ...asking them if they were happy with their lives. What he said was quite right. Robledo says that this guy, due to his problem, in the case he's... -... a freak... -You mean sissy, Dad. -That's what they' re called. -Yes, of course I know. But it' s hard for me to accuse him. Why accuse him? Is it a crime? And what did Robledo say? That... that' s why this guy is... ... margined. He looks at things from outside... ... because society isn't built correctly. Everything is adverse. And for you? -What? -For you, an ordinary man,... ... things are not adverse? -What are you doing? -You scared me. I didn't hear you. -Where are you coming from? -The movies. What do you mean? It's 3 am. -What are you laughing at? -You. You have the face of a father. I like to have you shaking with fear every time I utter a word. What are you doing? I' m looking for some pictures Grandma gave me. I thought they were here but I can't find them. And you' re looking for them at 3 am? Yes, I just felt like it. Today I told a friend of mine... ...something that happened to me when I was a kid. -And I remember there's a photo of that day. -What day? The day both of us went out alone. You took me to the zoo. You were a little girl. Yes. We never went out alone again. That's why I remember. This room looks terrible. It's a mess but I don't know where to start. -Mom's sewing machine was there, wasn't it? -Yes. Dad,... ... how did you love Mom? -That's a strange question. -Yes, but how did you love her? I don't know. A lot. And you never got bored? We didn't have time. -Do you like widows? -What do you mean? I' m just asking. -You want me to get married? -Why not? -You' re very handsome. -Why don't you get married? And leave you alone with those beasts? And I don't have a boyfriend. I don't know... I want to do something... ... but I don't know what. Sometimes l' m afraid. -What do you mean? -l' m afraid. I' m afraid that nothing will happen to me. That nothing will ever happen to me like... I've finished. -Okay. -Do you want me to wait while you check it? -Did you check it? -Yes, twice. -That's okay. Leave it there and go home. -Thank you. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. You can't complain. Why, Sir? The guy they hired to replace Santini is a cute boy. Come here. I' ll help you. -Bring your list. -But you've finished. But I gotta stay all the same. Come so we' ll leave earlier. Dictate that to me. -Bancalari... -No, wait, wait. -500 spark... -Where were you? I marked it down in pencil. I' d rather not write on it... ...because after so many checks it' ll look untidy. It' s a feminine mark. You need the glasses or you wear them to cover your face? In high school a friend of mine... ...used to put them on and take them off, like you do. He didn't need them but... ... he was shy and he thought the glasses covered his face. I need them. The ophtalmologist prescribed them. Donado, 100 spark plugs. Model: 17 M. 30 platinum, model: 20 E. Flores, 165 spark plugs, model: 17 F. I'd rather you wouldn't have worked overtime, but last week... -...Robledo, Mendez and Sierra did it 3 times. -Robledo told me. It's a good idea to take turns. It's unfair for you to be... -...the one who always works overtime. -I don't have a choice. And I don't care. Nobody's waiting for me. Poor Geller, he was desperate. -Maybe somebody was waiting for you. -No. Nobody? Not today. Today. But you do have a boyfriend. Kind of. And does he know he' s " kind of" a boyfriend? Is anybody waiting for you? -l' m a widower. It' s been 20 years now. -I didn't know. Do you live far from here? -One hour trip. -You' ll get home starving. -Let's go and have dinner. -No, thanks, they' re waiting for me. Mom and Dad. Dad... ...doesn't stop working till I get home. -What does he do? -He's a tailor. -But a very bad one. -What do you mean? All his jackets are the same. With "sad shoulders", as he says. His jackets only suit the mannequin. Poor Dad! Do you know what he uses to say? The only well done thing in this world is Bach's music. Are you an only daughter? Why? -Does it show? -No. The streets look strange at this hour. I' m kind of a maniac. -I like to walk, to walk through different places. -Why? I don't know. For a change. I don't like to walk always through the same places. -You must think l' m crazy. -Not at all. -Here it is. -Thank you for your company. See you tomorrow. -Bye. He's leaving. Where to? -I don't know. He's leaving home. He' ll live on his own. -Why? Dad! You know what's going on with Jaime. -I didn't know anything. -Yes, you knew. We all knew. You also said his friends were weird. He's like his friends! Blanca, what do you mean? Do you know what you' re talking about?! It's okay. Don't cry. -So you' re leaving? -Yes. Can you tell me why? It's easier this way for all of us. -I don't want it to be easy. -But I do! I don't want to be judged or treated as a sick person. -Why, Jaime? -I want to be alone, I want to live in peace. That' s not what l' m asking? And what are you asking? Jaime, I don't want you to suffer. I don't want you to be alone. I don't know what went wrong with you. -I don't know why I didn't realize. -You didn't want. -But don't worry, it wouldn't have helped. -No? Jaime... Are you sure? Are you sure things are that way? Yes, yes, l' m sure. Don't suffer. That thing you' re scared of, hasn't happened yet. I' m so miserable. -lnchauste's file, sir. -What's going on with Avellaneda? -You' re singing a serenade to her? -Why? -You've been talking a lot to her. -Poor girl. I saw her... ...arguing with a guy at the diner. I think she was crying. Have you seen her face? -Did you have a fight with your boyfriend? -Yes. Sometimes it's good to have a fight so you start all over again. -I don't want to start all over again. -But you' re sad. It's not that. I cherish an illusion and everything goes wrong. I knew what I had to tell him but... ... I got so nervous that I burst into tears. I hate to cry. Hi, Dad. -Mr. Alejandro Ferrero, my father. -How do you do? He has come to get the tools Jaime left at the workshop. -Do you want some coffee? -No, thanks. I don't have time. -Then l' ll go get those tools. -Yes. -Excuse me. -Okay. -So you' re a friend of Jaime' s? -Yes. This kind of houses are nice. Jaime told me you've lived here since he was born. No, long before that. I've lived here since I got married. Jaime is living with you? With me? No, why? He's living in a boarding house. -Why have you thought he's living with me? -No... -lt was just an idea. -What kind of idea? Excuse me, but aren't you too old to be Jaime's friend? -What do you mean? -You know exactly what I mean. No, I don't know. You' ll have to speak clearer, Mr. San Tome. You think l' m the pervert who corrupted your son... ... and you don't dare to ask. Ask me. If you ask me, l' ll answer. I don't know. I don't know what to ask. I' d like... ... to hear about Jaime. I'd like to know how he lives. But I don't know. Listen. I' m not the pervert who corrupts your son. There' re no perverts. And nobody is corrupted. I don't know anything about that. About what? -About what? -Don't laugh at me. I don't know my son. Your son? Your son is a sad boy... ...who doesn't have the same sexual propensity as you. At this point, I don't know if he has any sexual propensity. He's too scared to do anything. Scared of what? Of being different. You can be different, you know? -Thanks. -You' re welcome. You should grin more often. It really suits you. -What does my face look like when I don't grin? -Excuse me? Do I look like a banker? I don't get it. They told me once I looked like a banker, no... That I looked like a worker who keeps accounts. No, you look like a man. See you tomorrow, sir. Avellaneda. -What a coincidence. -What a coincidence. -Do you want to have a drink? -Okay, thank you. -There's a place there. -l' m in a hurry. I' m going to... -...the movies with a friend. -No boyfriend? -Not anymore. Nice, isn't it? Yes. -Good afternoon. -What will you have? -A cup of tea. -A cup of coffee. -Okay. It' s no coincidence. This meeting, I mean. It's not casual. I've been coming here every afternoon for a week. You once said you came this way every time you visited... ... a friend of yours, remember? So? So I sat down here waiting for you to come by. Why? I' d like... ...to find the perfect way to put it into words. I think l' m in love with you. The most logical thing would've been to keep it silent. Anyway, whatever happens,... ... take it as a homage. And please don't feel you' re obliged to do anything. I think... ... I began to realize I was in love... ... the first time I walked you to the bus. That day we... ... talked about your boyfriend. -Remember? -Yes, I do. The day of the argument. Well... I just had to tell you, do you get it? I get it. You get it but don't you have anything to tell me? Okay... First tell me what you mean when you say you' re in love. I think l' ll feel even more ridiculous. You don't want to make a fool of yourself but neither do l. To be in love might mean many things to men. Okay... Take the best of those things. It makes me... ... feel very bad to tell you this but... ... you could be my daughter. And we both know that. And there lies the problem. What can I offer you? Courtship? Ten years from now l' ll be 60. What l' m proposing is... ... an agreement,... ... a deal between... ... what I feel,... ...between my love and your freedom. The day you came to the office... ... was my 49th birthday. And I've been a widower for 20 years. I've never felt that a woman could be my couple. But I do feel that with you. I don't know, l... ... I have the feeling you' re... ...the only person with whom I can talk about certain things,... ...with whom I'd like to wake up every morning. And I know you. And I know you. I know how many moles there are in your face. That you comb your hair when you' re nervous. That routine bores you to death. That you cross your left leg over your right leg. Well... I think that's love, don't you? I resigned myself to so many things in life: To not being important to anyone. To not understanding my children. To not travelling, I don't know, to not writing a book. I don't want to resign myself to losing you... ... without attempting to do something. I knew. More or less, but I knew. That's why I don't look so surprised. Because l' m not. I was waiting for you to tell me. But I don't know what to do. I like you. I love you,... ... I think. But... ... it's all so complicated, isn't it? Maybe we should think it over. I... I' m not too brave. I don't know if l' ll be able to stand a situation... ... that's kind of strange. -I'd like to be older. -Or that I'd be younger. No. You are what you are because of your age. But I don't know. There are so many things I don't like. And if we hurt each other... ... and we feel miserable? I have nothing to lose. It's better for me to suffer... ... than to be living the way I live. But you' re so young. You could overlook this whole thing. No. I don't think I could. -Okay. Until tomorrow. -Until tomorrow. Martin... I wanted to tell you you' re very kind to me,... -...you' re really behaving yourself. -Really? I' m serious. You say that but... ... when I was a kid they taught me... ... that when you behave properly, you get a prize. Of course. You deserve it. Nice. -What's wrong? -What a shame! -ls it me? -What a shame! What a shame! It's a shame it all turned out to be this way. It's a shame that I wasn't born before... ...and that you lived all this time without me. I' m so sorry! -Mr. San Tome, can you explain something to me? -Sure. How can I restrain myself from kissing you at work? I don't know but l' m glad you feel like kissing me. Thank you, Mr. San Tome. Mom! He's trying to hit me! Children, please! -Stop fooling around! -Go inside. Come here, Martin. Rosa, bring me that envelope! And we want to be left alone. -Do you want a liquor? -No, thanks. -Just a little. -Bring me that envelope.You know where it is? Yes. I' ll go get it. What a mess!You must be used to it with your three children. -But they' re grown-ups. -At their age they only make... ... noise. They' re like my brothers and l, full of energy. Here you have. Don't you want a glass of liquor? -Don't ask him, just serve it! -Thank you. -Alejandro is still hitting her. -Don't worry. They won't die! -Sugar? -Will you leave us alone?! -Hey. -Yes? -Come back when your husband leaves. -You' re so rude! My sister-in-law is pretty,uh? Leave that coffee. Come and sit here. I' ll make you suffer. Do you remember this one? Of course! Your parents were so young. You remember that neighbor? That was Mrs. Luisa, my neighbor from the back. This Spaniard sang very good. And look at you. Your face looks just the same. Even as a kid you looked serious. I was thin. I was really skinny. And do you remember this one? -He's Cayolas! -Of course! Cayolas! You remembered Cayolas! He was the funniest of the gang. He listened to the funniest... -...jokes and he never laughed. -He was amazing. I had dinner with him a month ago. I see him once in a while. But he's changed now. He's bald, fat. And he laughs! -He laughs? -More than I do. You' re a beast. I' m sorry, sir, but you' re a beast. He hit... ...her face with a monkey wrench. She' ll die and... ...it' ll be your fault. I begged you not to leave your tools there. Okay! Women get scared. -Look what I found here! -Let me see. New Year's eve. The picture of all the gang at the Chueco's. -Her sister was about to get married. -Here' s Saverio. We called him "Cruel"! -What? -Look who's here! -Who? -Paving Block. He's so elegant. Paving Block, damn it! -I don't find it funny. -What? You know I hated it. What? You know I hated being called Paving Stone. Oh, that's you. Of course it's you. -What are you drinking? -Chocolate. -What are you laughing at? -Chocolate. I feel l' m a satyr. -It's delicious. Have one. -No, thanks. I' ll stick to coffee. Coward! -You want to go to the movies? -Weren't you supposed... -...to see Blanca? -At 10:30. She' ll introduce his boyfriend to me. I' m happy. But l' m scared. Well... -You wouldn't want me to make a speech. -No, on the contrary. I've been thinking l' m the one who should make a speech. But you surely want to know about me. Yes, sure, but... ... I don't know how to ask. I've no experience. Neither do l. I' m not a good match... ... and... I don't intend to change. Blanquita says you' re not interested in that... ... but I think it's better for me to tell you. I' m not a successful man of tomorrow, as they call them. I don't know. I don't earn a lot of money because... ...I' m not interested in working 20 hours a day. I'd rather do other things like... ... working in politics. I can't think of anything else to tell you. Do you want to ask me anything? Excuse me. I laughed because I remembered... ...I told lsabel's father exactly the opposite. Isabel was my wife. I told him I was the successful man of tomorrow. Poor old guy! I' m sure he didn't believe me. -What' s wrong? -Nothing. I' m fed up with working overtime. You don't want to work in the evening so you come earlier. It's not the same. I come to work an hour earlier. Anyway, I can't sleep. -You planning on staying there all the morning? -Yes, sir. Until my shift begins. What' re you looking at? I just want to leave earlier. To have the evening for myself. For yourself and who else? You think it doesn't show? Come on, spit it. You' re seeing a woman. This might be tragic. At your age it's dangerous. So? You won't tell me? No. I woke up an hour later for nothing. Be careful. You' re the right person to be a victim. If you take it too seriously, you may end up in trouble. Why? What may happen to me? What's worse than an empty life? -You' re right. -Do me a favor. -As long as it doesn't involve working. -Fill in the... -...pools ticket. I don't understand anything. -Me. As Loco says, l' m a blockhead. The guys prepared something for him for next week. -You' re always playing jokes on him. -It's great. When we... ...fill in the ticket, he doesn't want to know what we choose. They' ll make him believe Mendez hit all soccer results. He' ll have a heart attack. Be careful. Oh God! Racing vs. San Lorenzo... Racing will win. You' re planning on being discreet for a long time? About that girl, I mean. -At last! -Careful. -Turn on the light. Take off your clothes. Quickly, come on. -Hurry. -Here's a towel. Careful. You' ll throw me to the ground. -Are you wet? -Yes, dry me off. -l' ll make tea. -Take off your clothes or you' ll get a cold. -And the matches? -On the first shelf. This. Happiness is exactly this. -How are you? -Always the same. You' re always behind the newspaper. I sometimes forget you have a face and I think of you... ... as a sports headline. Are you drunk? One day I don't say good morning and you think l' m drunk. Unbelievable! What' re you going to do? You won't go to the match? No, we played in Rosario and I didn't feel like going. You won't go out with your girlfriend? You' re playing a matchmaker or a detective? A father. -Too late. -ls that an accusation? No. Listen, Esteban. Esteban. Yes? Can you put down that paper for a change?! What' s wrong with you? Now you' re shouting? What's wrong with all of you? You' re always bothering me. Blanca tried to talk to a newspaper? She was trying to find out why you don't live here anymore... -...and why l' m so bitter. -And did you help her understand? What? Why you left without saying anything? It was that, wasn't it? Alright. I' m living with a woman. I love her. I have that right. She's a very nice person but she's much younger than me. That's it. I told you. Now that you' re having a relationship you wake up. The father opens his eyes, looks around and says: " What's wrong with this boy? He's always so bitter." You' re my father, that's what's wrong! I don't know how to escape from this trap of doing... ...the same work every day for 30 years just to retire! Because l' m just like you! Just the same! And that's what scares me! It's like having a mirror in front of me, you understand? A mirror that is set ahead. The worst of all is that I have nothing to reproach you with. You' re a good guy, you' re smart. What's killing me is the thought of living all my life this way. No. That's if you want that. Why? You wanted it to be that way? No. No, dear, no. I just gave up. Because at your age, I wasn't furious. If I had been furious, l wouldn't have led the life I led. But you' re still on time. -You can change things. -It's easier said than done. I can't do another job. You want me to starve to death? But my son! If at my age... ...I dare live with a woman who could easily be my daughter,... ...if I have the boldness to start over again,.. ...why wouldn't you do the same? You must do it. Think about the kind of life you want... ...and you' ll see it doesn't depend on your job that much. I've just come to learn that. What you really want is what you' re meant to be. So you must take it or give it a try. You can spend your whole life looking for that... ... but it's a better life... I don't know... ... than trying to get promotions or making money,... ... or giving up. That girl... The girl you talked about... Yes? What's her name? Laura. Is she as pretty... ... as Mom was? It's really easy. Mendez calls and says we won on the pools. You' re shocked and you give the phone to someone else. I' m no good for that kind of things. I' ll blow your cover. -You' ll get the phone. -And where will you be? -I told you l' m no good for this. -But you' ll have to pretend... ... or you' ll ruin our joke. Don't you think that joke's too risky? -How long will you cling to that joke? -For some minutes. Mendez will be right back. Be careful! Good morning. -Mendez hasn't arrived yet? -No. Do you need him? No, why would l? I'd better stay here so that I can answer the phone. -Robledo, did you see Mendez yesterday? -No. Why? As you go to soccer matches together I thought... No, I haven't seen him. -What was the prize for the football pools? -7 40 million. Get out. He's about to call. Hi. No, Martinez. Who is it? What's wrong? Mendez. What? What?! What are you saying? Don't play jokes on us. What?! -All of them? -What is he saying? All our soccer results were right! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! We won the soccer pools! I knew it! I knew it! 7 40 million! We won! We won! We did it! We' ll all retire... ... but we' ll all be rich! Rich! Come on, Sierra! Come on, Sierra! This job is over! It's over! I' m through with this! Come on, Sierra! Come on, come on, Sierra! -Come on, come on, Sierra! -What's all that shouting? I' m shaking to death. I have some news for you. We' re millionaires. Millionaires! All of us are millionaires! And you can go and fuck yourself! Let me kiss you. You' re still afraid of him? -We can hire him to open the doors of our car. -Stop it. We' re millionaire! Millionaire! But don't worry. We' ll give you some money, Piggy. Listen, Sierra. The guys... All of us decided... ... until you get another job... It's no sacrifice to any of us. We' re several guys. We' ll gather your salary... ... until you find another job. Come on, man. Why don't you go and fuck yourselves? Do you remember that day Santini had that attack,... ... a week before he left? Yes, I remember. Did you realize? In another way, he talked about the same things as Sierra did. Who, Santini? Yes. I know they were different but... ... he couldn't stand it either... ... and called us slaves all day long, like Sierra. I don't know but I think... ... that's why we plot without even realizing. And we do something to... ... get them off our backs,... ... to stop them from disturbing us,... ... to stop them from dreaming in a loud voice. You can't stand it either. Why don't you take some vacations? -You know l' m retiring, don't you? -Yes. -Don't you find it crazy? -No, why? Now that Suarez's been fired, everybody's saying l' ll be... -...sub-manager. -But you don't want to go on working? -But how will we manage? -We' ll think of something. -You' re okay? -Yes. You wouldn't mind living with a retired worker. If you don't mind living with a woman with a cold. You look so good. I've never seen you so happy. -Do you love her a lot? -Yes. -Aren't you going to get married? -No. She's too young. It wouldn't be fair. -ls that what she says? -I say that but she understands. What is she like? Would you like to meet her? He has a girlfriend! He has a girlfriend! He has a girlfriend! Blow your nose.Don't embarrass me in front of my daughter. -Hi. -Okay, the time has come. Don't get nervous. I' m more scared than you are. -Hi. -At last! The rice was overcooking. Did you miss me? -A lot. -So did l. The rice! I've something to tell you. Geller mimics Robledo. Today he walked me to the bus and I couldn't stop laughing. Martin! I was waiting for you. Let's go have a coffee. -l' m sorry, someone's waiting for me. -Just a coffee. -They' re waiting for me. -I must talk with you. I' m desperate. Why? It happened. -What happened? -My sister-in-law. -What sister-in-law? -I saw it coming. She was always seducing me. I have a reputation... And now she' s driving me crazy. I think my wife found out. I don't know what to do. That's the fate of seducers. -l' m leaving. They' re waiting for me. -I tell you... ... I' m desperate and you leave. I' m sorry. I was with Santillan. Have a seat. Okay, San Tome, here we are. I won't tell you any news. You know the sub-management... ... is vacant. That position is yours. We just have to make it official. -Actually... -No, don't thank me, please. Your help will be really useful. I must take my wife to Europe, otherwise she' ll kill me. You should come and work in this floor... ... during the afternoons. How much time do I have to give you an answer? I' m sorry, I don't get it. An answer to what? If l' ll accept the position or not. San Tome, what's wrong with you? Are you sick? No, l' m okay but... ...after 30 years I feel like doing something else... -...and I'd like to retire. -Don't talk nonsense! Do you think they' ll offer you an executive position knowing... ...you' re planning to retire? What' re you planning to do? Go and sunbathe at the park? Aren't you ashamed? Five months from now everything will be different. Although it's too late for some things, with you... -...it' ll all be different. -Too late for what? -For so many things. -What things? To... ... write a book,... ... to dance like Fred Astaire. Why is it too late to write a book? Do you love me? -Excuse me? -You've never told me you love me. It's so hard to be romantic with that cough. -Yes. -You have fever. We' re two fools. You should've seen a doctor a week ago. -He' ll tell me to stay in bed. -And you' ll do it. You' ll call the office and say: " I can't go to work. I've to look after Avellaneda." I'd better go to my parents' for some days. You don't want to be alone? Then I won't go. No, you should go. Your mother will take good care of you. But don't stay here alone. Go with your children. You' ll get sad. -How are you, Dad? -How are you? Sit down. And Blanca? She's getting dressed. -You' re going out? -Yes. -We' re going to the movies. -They' re so stupid. Look at that! -Of course! -Again! Dad! I didn't know you were coming. You' re staying? Come, come. -Anything wrong? -No. Laura has the flu. She' ll be at her mother's for a few days. -Did you have dinner? -No, but l' m not hungry. -Don't you want to join us? -No, l' m tired. -It's getting late. -Good evening, sir. -Bye. -Bye, Dad. -Bye, honey. -Bye. -You want to come? -No, I want to go to bed early. -So you' re staying? -Yes. Wait for me. I' m coming. -ls there anything wrong? -No, l' m fine. -Really? -Really. -Alright. See you later. -See you later. Hello. No, Robledo. Who is it? Oh yes. How is she? Okay. No problem. Send her our regards. I hope she gets better. No problem. I' ll tell him. -On behalf of Avellaneda. -They wanted to talk to me? No, just tell us the doctor ordered her to stay in bed. -For how long? -I didn't ask. I didn't want her to think we were hastening her. -Sure. -Anything wrong? -No, why? -Your face looks awful. I' m just tired. That thing with that woman... ... is okay? Okay. Please, now you push when you cover. -That doesn't mean they' re playing. -What do you mean? You call that playing? That's so nice! So that's playing? Give me a break, man! Playing was what we did at my time. I'd like to see one of your players playing today. -There wasn't anything. -I mean the younger ones. -When they' re in minor leagues, they play. -Yes, they do play. Hey. Robledo. -Give me a break! -Robledo, stop it. Robledo! Cut it out! Hello. Yes, it's me. How is she? What are you talking about? Shut up! Shut up, bastard! Shut up! What are you talking about? -Shut up, bastard! -What's wrong? -Shut up! -Give me the phone. -Tell him to shut up! -Who is it? What happened? How did it happen? No, l' m sorry. But he's shocked. Yes. We were all very fond of her. Excuse us. Avellaneda... She died this morning. -Sir? -Excuse me. Good afternoon. The tailor lives here? Yes. -I wanted to have a suit made. -Come in, please. They' re looking for you. -Good afternoon. I wanted to have a suit made. -Sure. -You brought your fabric? -No. I' ll see if I have something you like. You live in the neighborhood? No, he was highly recommended. These fabrics are good. Okay. This one. When will it be ready? I have to get your measures and you must choose a model. -Like this one. -Hold on a minute. I' ll take your measures. Pretty, isn't she? She was our only daughter. Forgive me. My wife will take your measures. She's good at that. Excuse me. It's you, aren't you? She talked about you. She spent the last 10 days talking about you. He doesn't know anything. I wanted to let you know but... ...there was no time. Everything happened so fast that... And there was no reason... The doctor said it was her heart... ... and that that kind of things happen. You can't take precautions. I pictured you the way you are. I think I recognized you when I opened the door. Forgive me but... ...I didn't want to come. I don't know why l' m here. I've been stunned all this month. When I left the office, I came straight here. I don't know what to say. Since that day... ...I haven't talked about her with anybody. I needed... I understand. I have something for you. Laura wanted to show you her pictures as a little girl. She was going to show them to you when she saw you again. I' ll give them to you. Here they are. And now leave and don't ever come back. Forgive me,... ... but he doesn't know anything about this... ... and I wouldn't know what to tell him. -l' m sorry, Dad, but we were worried about you. -Come in. How are you? Fine, son. May I help you? Not much. That's it. It's over. I know what l' ll tell you will sound stupid... ... but you mustn't think it's all over. It was not just her. You felt like living again. Does that have to end?
