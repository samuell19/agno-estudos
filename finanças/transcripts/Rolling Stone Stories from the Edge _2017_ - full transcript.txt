But when hip-hop came along, I would try to rhyme like the rappers in hip-hop rhymed, about parties and stuff. - ♪ Scream, whoopee-doo, go for yours ♪ ♪ 'Cause dreams come true ♪ - And my friends were like, "Say that shit you say about us!" You know, I'm like, "But those are criminal rhymes. Like, you don't want to say those." And they would-- they said, "Say them, just sing them!" So I did a song called "6 in the Mornin" with, "6:00 in the morning, police at my door. "Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor. "Out the back window I made my escape. "Didn't even get a chance to grab my old-school tape. "Mad with no music, but happy 'cause free, "and the streets to a player is the place to be. "I got a knot in my pocket weighing at least a grand.

The first big piece that I did with him was I did a feature when the "New Jack City" movie came out. And then we did some other things in between. I remember speaking to him on his car phone in the midst of the L.A. riots. Ice-T, by this time, had established not only his rap career, he had already started exploring these other interests that he had. He made no secret ever that he was also this metalhead, rock and roller. [upbeat hip-hop music] - Now, I'm doing this rap, and I noticed that when we would play the up-tempo records, they would mosh. Mosh pits would start. ♪ ♪ A mosh pit is fascinating. What is really going on? Is that dancing? Is this some kind of release of energy, you know, male testosterone just going crazy? So I came back home and I'm like, I want to do a rock band. So I got my bandmate Ernie C., who played guitar all through Crenshaw. I got Mooseman, who was a weed dealer, but he could play bass. Beatmaster V, who was a weed dealer, but he could play drums. I said, "We're going to make this group Body Count." We're going to mix Suicidal with Slayer with Black Sabbath. It's gonna be fast, evil music. [Body Count's "Body Count" begins] ♪ It's real fucked up ♪ At this time, Body Count, we were just a concept. We hadn't made an album. We were playing, like, pizza joints. ♪ Goddamn, what a brother gotta do ♪ ♪ To get a message through ♪ ♪ To the red, white and blue? ♪ Yo, Beatmaster V, take these motherfuckers to South Central. ♪ ♪ Ha ha! The craziest member of Body Count was my drummer, Beatmaster V. We used to always say he's got, you know, one foot in the penitentiary, the other one on a banana peel. He was that guy. - ♪ Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est ♪ - I, uh, walked into the rehearsal hall singing, "psycho killer, qu'est que c'est." And he goes, we need a cop killer! And he started just rambling off all the stuff the cops were doing, how they were whupping people's asses, running up in the spot, shot this guy's baby. Just dirty cop shit. And my wheels started turning. I'm like, "What if somebody snapped? What if police brutality sent somebody over the edge?" So coming off of "Psycho Killer," I turned the psycho killer into a cop killer. This next record is dedicated to some personal friends of mine--the LAPD. For every cop that has ever taken advantage of somebody, beat 'em down or hurt 'em, for every one of those fucking police, I'd like to take a pig out here in this parking lot and shoot 'em in their motherfucking face. ["Cop Killer" begins] ♪ ♪ The album was out for a year... ♪ Cop killer ♪ Before it was brought to the attention of the Fraternal Order of the Police from Austin, Texas. all: Hey-hey, ho-ho, Time Warner's got to go! - Texas police who started the controversy urged Time Warner to pull the album made by Ice-T. - It calls for cold-blooded, premeditated murder. - And I call on every American to condemn that kind of thing! - Actor Charlton Heston, an NRA supporter, joined the protest against the album. - "Die, die, die, pigs, die. Police, I know your family's grieving." Catchy little number, isn't it? - ♪ I know your family's grieving ♪ ♪ Fuck 'em, cop killer ♪ ♪ But tonight we get even, ha ha ♪ - For the police, it was a very savvy political move, because at the moment, the cops were under siege, just like they are today. They turned me into the enemy, and everyone got mad at me and stopped looking at what they were doing. So they--they-- they used me in a way. ♪ ♪ - When this story broke, I remember going to Jann's office and saying, "Look, I can make one phone call and go and get with this guy." - "The Source" magazine, which was the hip-hop so-called Bible at the time, they were telling me, "You got to give an exclusive interview to us." So I was like, "You guys aren't the source, I'm the source. Y'all report on the source." "Rolling Stone" was very polite. Alan, who wrote it, was a friend. He was like, "Ice, you know, we would really be-- we'd like to give you this," and I was like, "You know what? "I can be in 'The Source' every day of the week, right? I'm gonna do 'Rolling Stone.'" So now I go to "Rolling Stone," I say "Yeah, let's go. Let's talk about this shit." No, I mean, I wrote the record. It's a record about a character. I know the character. I've woken up feeling like this character. I've never clicked over, but when I saw that shit on TV, I wanted to get out there. I know a lot of people did. And to me, to say I can't write about this because I'm gonna offend somebody is bullshit, you know? I didn't think it was going to be the cover. Mark Seliger, he took the picture, right? He had these ideas. "We're going to put you in a police uniform." So I'm like, "What?" [chuckles] He goes, "No, this is the ultimate nightmare "of a racist cop, is getting pulled over by you and having you have the billy club." And it actually did what he said it was going to do. It outraged a lot of people. See, one thing about being, you know, a black artist, a lot of people don't think that rappers are capable of art. They don't--they take everything we say literal. They don't understand that we might have a grain of intelligence. So that's all a part of the racism and shit that goes into it. You know, like, when they attacked the record, they called it a rap record, which it wasn't. It was a rock record. - ♪ B-C, B-C ♪ - ♪ South Central, nigga ♪ - ♪ B-C ♪ ♪ ♪ You know, if they say, "Well, it's a rock record," well, people might go, "Well, hey, I like Fleetwood Mac. "Maybe, you know-- maybe it's like "one of those '60s records where people were against the police, you know?" But by saying it's rap, it's like, "Oh, it's the niggas talking that shit." That became the issue. I saw deeper than even the song. It was me transferring black rage to white youth, and once you cross that border and you put those white fists in the air singing about the same injustices, that's the fear. The fear is he's crossing over to our kids. And, you know, when that parent wants to say, "Oh, yeah, you know, those niggers are rioting," his little daughter is going, "They're not niggers, Dad, and they have a reason." ♪ ♪ But I learned firsthand that you have the right to say anything, but people also have the right to get angry. If I want to say something anti-gay, well, I got to be prepared for the gay movement to attack me. If I say something against women--they have that right. So you can't just, you know, like I say, you can't go home to your girl and say, "Yo, I fucked your sister. Free speech." It doesn't-- you know, it's like, "Yeah, free speech, but, yeah!" So my mistake was thinking I could sing anything and there would be no repercussions. - Sitting next to Ice-T is one of his main critics, Tipper Gore, who is founder of the PMRC, which for years has been actively fighting what they call the destructive influence of today's music lyrics on children. - We have freedom of speech in this country, and you have a right to have lyrics that abuse women, that use racism, but was have a right to speak out against them, and we also have a right to alert parents that this is being marketed aggressively to very young kids at a time when they are forming their opinions. - I think what nobody was prepared for in this situation was just how strong an adversary they had picked in going after Ice-T. - I'll just put it all in a nutshell. The enemies of the music is what fuels the fire. As soon as a kid comes home from school and his mother says, "Have you listened to your Ice-T album today?" I'm through. Rock and roll has always got to have an enemy. That's what keeps it rock and roll! [overlapping shouting] - Stop hating his music! - You were dealing with somebody who was absolutely up for whatever sort of debate, whatever sort of challenge you were gonna throw at him. - You know, Tipper was very outspoken, but if you noticed when Clinton and Al Gore ran for president, you never heard anything else from her. Someone issued a gag order. Someone says, "We're trying this youth vote. You must remain quiet." And I guess Tipper is just shopping for shoes now. I don't know where she's at. But she ain't, uh, speaking. She was unhip, and they came off as the hip guys. - Here's Arsenio.... Hall! [lively saxophone music] ♪ ♪ - Bill Clinton was the first Baby Boomer to run for president, and the first Democrat to come along in a long time, and, of course, I found this extremely compelling. ♪ ♪ And I just thought this is a perfect subject of "Rolling Stone," which accompanied the rise and spoke for this generation through the music we spoke for, the things that they had read in "Rolling Stone" or the crusades we'd been a part of. - The big man... [crowd cheering] - The first time we interviewed Clinton, we went down to Little Rock, Arkansas, during the campaign. It was kind of this joint interview between myself, Hunter, P.J. O'Rourke, and Bill Greider-- our top political team. - I was managing editor at "The Washington Post," and Hunter claims that he was up late one night taking a leak and thought of me, and that was the inspiration for my career change. In "Rolling Stone," you're not talking to the professor you had in English 201. You're talking to the people who read this magazine. It was liberating. - ♪ Come on, baby, let the good times roll ♪ ♪ Come on, baby ♪ - You know, Jann Wenner was this kid who loved rock and roll and decided he'd start a rock and roll magazine, and he's interviewing the next president of the United States in this group that he assembled that's a pretty weird group. - ♪ Come on, baby, show me how you feel, yeah ♪ - We had drank too much the night before and got up in the morning raring to go. It was taking place in this joint called Doe's Café, which is where all of the campaign people and the press people ate and drank. - ♪ Come on, baby ♪ - Jann was in love with the Clintons, but Hunter was also quite thrilled. And he gave Clinton a couple of high-quality French saxophone reeds. - I think we're on the right side of history. I think the time has come for America to change its policies fundamentally. - Hunter had his own list of questions about the gun laws but also the drug laws. - You've seen the statement I put out last week... - Clinton wanted that interview to make it very clear that he was not your standard-brand liberal who was for smoking dope. Hunter was so offended. He gets up from the table. He came back in about 15 minutes with a tall drink, and he never asked another question. It was like, "Interview is over for me. You've shown me who you really are." And then P.J. O'Rourke, who was a sharp-witted right-winger, has come to the table loaded for bear with ideological questions. - Sometimes the most conservative thing in the world to do is to change. It's the only you can preserve those things which are most dear to you and that's what I'm obviously hoping the American people will believe. - And Clinton just turned him around on a dime. So it's now down to me and Jann Wenner, and I'm left entering into a pretty wonkish conversation with Bill Clinton. Shift in tax burdens and savings and loan... He knew what would fetter my ego, asking about obscure things that most people had never heard of. That was terrific. - You're a really smart man. Thanks, Hunter! - Jann, P.J., Hunter were of a certain age. - You remember Hunter Thompson. - They had a feeling that they were going to change the country again, maybe the world, and, uh, I didn't share that self-glory because I was a bit older. - So now we know, you know, his favorite Beatle is Paul McCartney. He voted for the skinny Elvis stamp, and he bites his nails. - So you came away feeling less enthused than you were going in? - I'm not going to, uh, go out and campaign for him, 'cause there's other people to. - Is that good or bad news for Bill? - During the war in Vietnam and during the Nixon era, the youth culture had gotten pretty well stomped, but rock and roll prevailed. - Together for the first time since 1982, Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Stevie Nicks!

My one regret is that I was slow, and I'm talking months, not years, in saying in print what I saw happening in Washington. - ♪ Yesterday's gone ♪ - Clinton was essentially abandoning organized labor and working people. It happened literally in the first year of the administration. And that was a sort of double-cross of the values he expressed as a young candidate. - I think I do need to be reminded that what I'm doing every day is for these folks. - Right. - It was a very quick thing for Clinton to make some gestures... - Hi, folks! - Hi, Bill! - Which his people applauded and made a big deal out of but were actually trivial or even deceptive. - I think we accomplished an awful lot. Maybe you can say some of it was due to newness or a touch of, you know, the arrogance of being new. - There's a word called hubris. - Sure is. Greek word. - Certainly is. - At the beginning of his administration, he had just come off a couple of big victories and Bill Greider went on to interview Clinton in his little executive dining room off the Oval Office. - To understand Clinton, you have to understand he was a seducer. He knew how to appeal to people in a way that would flatter them or beguile them. And he's good at it, but I'm a reporter. After everything else, I'm a reporter. And I realized there was something that I should have asked about. At the very end, as we're literally getting up from the table, I said, "What do you care about that you would fight and die for?" And he--he just exploded. - I have fought more damn battles here for more things than any president has in 20 years and not gotten one damn bit of credit from the knee-jerk liberal press, and I'm sick and tired of it, and you can put that in the damn article. - He thinks he has beguiled me especially, but also Jann. And this was a signal that he did not succeed in seducing me. - And you get no credit around here for fighting and bleeding. And that's why the know-nothings and the do-nothings and the negative people and the right-wingers always win... because of the way people like you put questions to people like me. Now, that's the truth, Bill. - I'd been toe-to-toe with angry politicians over the years. He was more personal in his tone and bearing. - And I'm sorry if I'm not very good at communicating it, but I haven't got a hell of a lot of help since I've been here either. - Thank you. - I think Bill was a well-intentioned good man. As a president, he was a little slick by half and flawed and-- and somewhat undisciplined as a person, but you do have to accept in politics and in life that it's not all going to be pure, and it's not all going to be exactly what you wanted. - I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that. I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. I was also very concerned about protecting my family. Indeed I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate.

So we would do Britney Spears and NSYNC and Backstreet Boys. Every generation of readers thinks that magazine has sold out, because they're putting who's currently popular on the cover, not who was popular when they were 17 or 18.

She is the perfect celebrity for America in decline. Like President Bush, she just doesn't give a fuck. But at least we won't have to clean up after her mess for the rest of our lives. [jet engine whooshing] - I remember, in the time I was brought in, being struck by the way "Rolling Stone" was perceived. I was interviewed on CNN, and the host of the program said, "'Rolling Stone, ' I thought they just covered music." That was really the reputation of the magazine. People didn't know P.J. O'Rourke and Hunter Thompson. The great tradition that the magazine had on the political scene had really been forgotten, even by people in journalism. - So, at that moment, Jann was really focused on restoring the magazine as a primary source of hard-hitting political journalism. "Rolling Stone" interviewed every president it could interview. Certainly we would have interviewed George W. Bush had he let us. And Obama arrived in such a history-making way. Obama was the first president where the magazine decided to endorse a Democratic candidate for president before the primaries were over. - At that time, there was the war in Iraq. There was the financial meltdown in 2007 and 2008. There was no shortage of pressing political issues. While there were all those issues, there were still a lot of stories that weren't being told in a very compelling way. I had been lobbying for months and months to do a piece on Afghanistan. Afghanistan was kind of off the radar at that moment. But I was really convinced that there must be some way back into Afghanistan. And then we met Michael Hastings. - I'm not trying to be a smartass here, um, though it takes effort for me sometimes, and I apologize for that. Uh, working for "Newsweek," the most interesting parts of my stories were actually being taken out. The news was always there, but it was, you know, the offhand comment, what people really say, how people really act, what it was like to be there. These sort of details that I find really fascinating. When I decided to leave "Newsweek," one of the things I wanted to do was capture all those details. - Michael was absolutely obsessed with Hunter S. Thompson-- shocker for a young journalist like him, uh, but, you know, he even named his corgi Gonzo. Writing at "Rolling Stone" was something that was always very aspirational for him. - "Rolling Stone" is a rock and roll-style journalism. You know, no holds barred, kick down the doors, you know, toss the hand grenade, expose the powerful, sort of journalism. - He went in to pitch about five articles, and one of them was that he wanted to profile General McChrystal, who was the commander of forces in Afghanistan. At the time, he said, you know, "I don't know if I'll get any access at all." - Michael himself thought he was never going to get to see McChrystal, that McChrystal would turn him down. And I said, "Well, give him a call, because I think you'll be surprised." "Rolling Stone" at that point had really remarkable access to the military for a very simple reason, which is that the U.S. military wanted to recruit and send our readers into battle. - ♪ Only in dreams ♪ ♪ We see what it means ♪ ♪ Reach out our hands ♪ ♪ Hold on to hers ♪ - So he called up McChrystal's folks, and lo and behold, they said, "Come along, and we'll give you all kinds of access." - ♪ And so it seems ♪ ♪ Only in dreams ♪ - Generals tend to be tight-lipped, and their press aides aren't just, you know, giving you unfettered access. It was just so bizarre, and it doesn't happen like this. It had never happened like this in his previous reporting. It really was "Almost Famous" but with the rock star general. - McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a Jedi commander. He carries a custom-made set of nunchakus in his convoy, engraved with his name and four stars. And his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. "The fucking lads love Stan McChrystal," says a British officer. He went out on dozens of nighttime raids unannounced, with almost no entourage. You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like, "Who the fuck is that?" And it's fucking Stan McChrystal. ♪ ♪ Paris is the most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine. It's a Thursday night in mid-April, and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the Hotel Westminster. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies... to keep up the fiction that we actually have allies. Last fall McChrystal dismissed the counter-terrorism strategy advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as shortsighted, saying it would lead to state of "Chaosistan." Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-liner. "Biden?" suggests a top adviser, "Did you say, 'Bite me'"? In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and veteran of the Cold War, a clown who remains stuck in 1985. - It was very apparent that the opening section, in particular, where they're saying nasty things about Joe Biden and displaying their contempt for the presidency and the commander in chief fairly openly was really explosive, but Michael was telling me that he was convinced that McChrystal was untouchable and that nothing could happen to McChrystal. [sirens wailing, gunfire] - World Police! Get down on the ground! - The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, and outright maniacs. - You lose. - They jokingly refer to themselves as "Team America," and they pride themselves on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ After arriving in Kabul, Team America set about changing the culture. McChrystal banned alcohol on base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess. - McChrystal himself keeps a murderous schedule. Up at 4:30, this is his idea of leisure time. - In the month I spend around the general, I witness him eating only once, a staple in almost every media profile. - He eats one meal a day. Anything more makes him feel sluggish. - You have what you have, and that's all you need. You realize you don't need a lot of other stuff. One thing of course you miss is family, but besides that, it's-- it's pretty much perfect. - It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man single-handedly winning the war. - General McChrystal was challenging the status quo. You know, McChrystal wouldn't allow Fox News to be played. He wasn't your typical Republican general. That was something that Michael found fascinating. He found Mike Flynn, who at the time was General McChrystal's intelligence chief, also to be a really interesting character. It was, you know, a lot of men who had really dedicated their lives to fighting these wars and had suffered great loss, and so, I think on some level, they got each other's mentality, but at the end of the day, he was going to be honest no matter what. He saw as his main responsibility telling the truth to his readers. - After nine years of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using the word "victory" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible, not even with Stanley McChrystal in charge. - I remember walking into the managing editor's office and saying, "I think this story is really going to get some attention." I remember no one else taking that very seriously at the time. It was kind of like, "Oh, yeah, really? Okay, great." But there was no moment of recognition until the morning that the story hit. - "Rolling Stone" making trouble. How did you get the leading general trashing the President, trashing the ambassador, trashing the head of the-- - The story was supposed to come out on a Wednesday morning. On Tuesday morning, at 4:00 in the morning my phone rang, and it was a producer from "Morning Joe," and he said, "The story has been leaked, "and President Obama has called General McChrystal back from Afghanistan." The McChrystal story brought down McChrystal before it was even published. - The conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general. It undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system. - The White House was fighting. The State Department was fighting. It was openly spoken about among people who were over in Afghanistan, and no one was really telling the story. - A lot of blowback came not from the Pentagon, but from other reporters who began to attack the story almost immediately, saying, "This can't be true," or, "Michael must have heard these things off the record and violated that agreement by printing them." - He was a rat in an eagle's nest. What he did is removing a fine soldier who's risked his life for this country time and time again. - Okay, okay, I got it. Geraldo, we got it. "Rolling Stone" says it ran the quotes by McChrystal. Do you believe that? - I--I-- If they say they did, I know Jann Wenner, I assume that it's true. I have to take him at his word. - He really broke an unspoken code of putting military leaders up on a pedestal, and by stripping off that veneer and reporting honestly, he got so much flak. - Michael Hastings, if you believe him, says that there were no ground rules laid out. And, uh, I mean that just doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, because I know these people. They never let their guard down like that. To me, something doesn't add up here. I just--I don't believe it. - It wasn't so much that they played by certain rules and we didn't. The real issue was that they were beat reporters. They covered this day in and day out. So they had to make certain choices every day about the things that they saw and the things that they heard and whether sharing them would mean that they wouldn't be allowed back in the room. It disappointed me that they would attack Michael when what Michael did was a very different kind of journalism. - What it illuminated was the extremely cozy relationship that many in my profession have established with--with very powerful figures and how much they cherish that relationship. Basically, the criticism is, "Wait. This guy wrote down what he heard and saw. Wait a minute. We're not supposed to do that." - The McChrystal story was the biggest story that "Rolling Stone" had ever had online, because it's history. It was a piece of history, and that work, the work of long journalism, in-depth journalism, deep-dive journalism, there's still a hunger for it. - In the early-morning hours of June 18, 2013, Michael Hastings died in a car crash in Los Angeles. A colleague remembers, part of his passion stemmed from a desire to make everyone else wake the fuck up and realize the value of the life we're living. He always sought out the hard stories, pushed for the truth, and let it all hang out on the page. [indistinct chatter] - The very first editorial meeting I went to, it was a story-idea meeting, and Jann was leading it. I was the only woman at the table, and so I was thinking of stories that I might be able to bring to the paper that would be important. The level of violence towards women was at that time completely unknown. So I had thought that if people understood what a rape was, what an actual rape was, what--what a rape did, that it took the most, uh... precious relationship between two people and turned it into the most horrible thing-- And I thought that if we could really get a rape case and simply go through the rape case, it would wake people up. Well, when I started to tell this story, of course I was a nervous wreck, and someone at that table said, "Why don't you just lean back and enjoy it? Then it wouldn't be a rape." I, um, was carrying on about how the story would be constructed, how the ideas, what the ideas would be, and there was still this titillating laughter, and I turned around and looked at Jann, and Jann was looking at me just like, "Yes, yes." He wasn't laughing. He took me seriously. - Sipping from a plastic cup, Jackie grimaced then discreetly spilled her spiked punch onto the sludgy fraternity house floor. The University of Virginia freshman wasn't a drinker, but she didn't want to seem like a goodie-goodie at her first frat party. She smiled at her date, whom we'll call Drew, and he smiled enticingly back. She took his hand as he threaded them out of the crowded room and up a staircase. Drew ushered Jackie into a bedroom. The room was pitch-black inside. Jackie began to scream. "Shut up," she heard a man's voice say as a body barreled into her, sending them both crashing into a low glass table. There was a heavy person on top of her, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms and excited male voices rising all around her. "Grab its motherfucking leg," she heard a voice say, and that's when Jackie knew she was going to be raped. - I'm drawn to stories about people who do bad things or bad things have been done to them, especially people who deceive other people. I think that really fascinates me. And then on the other end, I'm really interested in, like, the repercussions of all those bad things. You know, what happens to people when bad things happen to them? - Sabrina was very, very valuable at "Rolling Stone," like an MVP. She was somebody that they could count on. She turned out a lot of really good stories that were really hard, and she nailed them. - A chilling account of a gang rape at the University of Virginia has reignited a tension over the problem of sexual assault on campus. In this case, it is provoking new investigations and questions about the university's response to assault cases and whether it has covered them up. The story appears in "Rolling Stone" magazine. It's an account of what happens to an unidentified freshman who is called Jackie. - The article comes out. The first thing off the bat, it galvanized everybody. It got so much attention. We felt, "Oh, great, look at-- we're causing the issue of rape on campus to be examined." Surely a worthy issue. - Sabrina, thank you for talking with us. First of all, how is she doing? And what's--is there is an investigation under way? Where does it stand? - Jackie herself is still incredibly traumatized by her assault, and, um, she feels really good about having spoken out. Um, it was a very difficult situation for her to speak out because she was really criticized for it by her peers and very much discouraged for it. - And then within a couple days, the writer of the article called up in tears, saying she doesn't trust her principle source anymore, and it was like a punch in the gut. It just started collapsing from there. - Two weeks ago, a "Rolling Stone" article with this headline got worldwide attention. Well, today "Rolling Stone" magazine backed off the story. In a letter to readers, the managing editor wrote, quote... - At "Rolling Stone," a big part of my job is managing a lot of personalities, a lot of creative people and sort of figuring out... how you get the most out of each person. These were our best people. I had no reason to second-guess. You know, maybe I should have, but, you know, I didn't. - The magazine also acknowledged its reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, never talked to Jackie's alleged accusers, saying Jackie asked the publication not to for fear of retaliation. - You've got this very young woman who's telling you that she's afraid of retaliation by this fraternity where you believe she has been gang raped. And the other thing is that in the ten years that I worked at "Rolling Stone," there were men at the top of the masthead the entire time. Being a progressive man, working at an antiauthoritarian magazine, they believed that they should not question women about cases of rape. - Representatives with the fraternity released a statement saying they never had a party during the weekend in question and sexual assaults are not a part of a pledge ritual, as Jackie alleged. In an article today, "The Washington Post" reported Jackie's friends recently began to question her account. - Nothing like that had ever happened to us before. 50 years. - The editors of "Rolling Stone" committed one of the worst journalistic sins in recent memory. - How can you fact-check something and not go around to some other people who were there and say, "Is this how you remember it?" - This is actually a tremendous act of public disservice to survivors of rape everywhere and to the people who are doing everything we can to make sure that this becomes a culture in which we honor and believe survivors of rape. - You know, it was a disheartening and dispiriting and sad experience. The only thing I could do about it was commission an investigation. So I called up the Columbia School of Journalism. We'd open up everything we had, all of our records on it, and would they come in and investigate and write a report up and I promise to publish it. - "Rolling Stone's" repudiation of the main narrative in "A Rape on Campus" is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. The problem was methodology. Journalists with decades of collective experience failed to bring up and debate problems about their reporting. - Most of the famous cases of journalism failure involve a fraud. So Janet Cooke invented and lied to her editors about that. So did Jayson Blair. So did Stephen Glass. What's so interesting about the "Rolling Stone" case is that's not at issue here. Sabrina Erdely worked honestly. She did not invent anything. She took really rigorous notes. And it also wasn't primarily a failure of fact-checking. It was a systems failure. - The fact-checking system is essentially based on the notion that the person is telling you the truth. And we had this extremely rare situation where someone has made up a story that is so elaborate and so complicated at so many different levels and layers. - The failure of "A Rape on Campus" was not due to a lack of resources. "Rolling Stone's" editorial staff has shrunk in recent years, yet the magazine continues to invest in professional fact-checkers and fund time-consuming investigations. Erdely and her editors had hoped their investigation would sound an alarm about campus sexual assault. Instead, the magazine's failure may have spread the idea that women invent rape allegations. - It was pretty damning. It did not help us in the eventual trial. I mean, we had been writing these kinds of stories for a long, long time. Maybe we were too cocky or sloppy, or it was just dumb fucking luck. Dumb fucking bad luck. - We opened ourselves up to a very transparent investigation, and it wasn't seen as like, here's an otherwise trustworthy place that made a mistake. It was seen as, oh, this is those elite mainstream-media journalists revealing their true colors. People used to view "Rolling Stone" as being on their side, and something shifted more recently where... you know, it became just another piece of the mainstream media that couldn't be trusted. ♪ ♪ - 2015 was a very, very bad year for this magazine. The UVA thing had happened. We lost our managing editor, and it was a big blow.

I'm surprised they're still in circulation after those guys sued the pants off of 'em. - It was in that summer that Donald Trump had announced his candidacy, and covering this was a chance for the magazine to get back to what it has always tried to do.

It is a landscape in which you have to be prepared to face the truth. "Rolling Stone" has always been unflinching, not afraid of the truth. - ♪ I've heard newborn babies wailing ♪ ♪ Like a mourning dove ♪ - What "Rolling Stone" is, and certainly was, and I hope continues to be really good at is dissecting a story that nobody is even aware of and finding its larger universal meaning. ♪ ♪ - "Rolling Stone" never lost its idealism, but also it got tempered with a lot of cynicism and, you know, reality, and-- and yet continued to fight and struggle for the things that we believed in, a generation believed in, and it's still a struggle. I mean, it hasn't been won, it hasn't been lost. And I think that the heirs to this generation, our own children, our next generation believe in all those things and are there to fight the fight and will be even smarter. ♪ ♪ In that sense, time is on our side.
