(whimsical music) (wind whistling) (suspenseful music) (vocalizing) (gong clangs) (slashing) (groaning) (groans and shouts) (gong clangs) (hollering) - Give it to her, give it to her, give it to her! (shouting) (gong clangs) (weapons clanging) (grunting) (groaning) (funky music) (vocalizing) (cheering) - Fellow Amazons, hear my words. I shall not waste time on oratory. I propose to you as our warrior to force Dharma to reveal his secret. The secret of the sacred fire. (cheering) (mellow music) - You sure this is the place? - Yeah. They say he eats here every day. - There are no free tables, I'm sorry. You'll have to come back later. - This will make things easier. If we make a disturbance, we can dispose of him in the confusion. Boys! (whistling) Get down here! - [Boys] What do you want us to do, boss? - Clear everybody out. (shouting and screaming) We're ready to eat, wench, now what have you got? (grunts) - Again. (grunts) - What are you waiting for? You eat afterwards. Go on, let's finish him off. (whooshing) (clanging) (wacky music) (clattering) (clanks) (smacking) (grunting) - Hey he's the one we want! All of you, knock him unconscious! (groaning) - Hmm? - No no, not again! - Heh. - All right boys, all together! (shouting) Now we got him! (shouting) (crashing) (smacking) (screams) - If you want a word of advice, Philonus, I think we got the wrong man. (chuckles) Hey, wouldn't it be better if we looked, you know, if we went and looked somewhere where it's a little quieter? - Just a minute. I'll teach that muscle-bound ox a lesson. - He's not a man to be trifled with. - Yeah? You'd be surprised. Hey. (crashes) (laughing) (screaming) (sword clangs) (groans) (clattering) (groaning) - Oh, my head. - All right my hearties, you've had your rest. On your feet! Get over here and give me a hand! Hurry up! Right, now pick up that weight. (groaning) Now hold it up in the air above you, you (mumbling), jump to it, get a move on! - I mean... - Come on now, sit down on that end. - Oh dear. - Come on, sit down. - I don't know if it's gonna work. (shouting) (screaming) (crashing) Sorry. (shouts) (groaning) (bonking) - Pretty clever. - I said I was sorry. (grunts) - Let's finish him off! Forward! (roaring) (wind whistling) Forward! Before he comes after me! (crashing) (funky music) (clanging) (bonking) - Let's go, m'hearties! - The name is Moog. The pleasure was all mine. (chuckling) (light music) - Egods, what's that? - Must be a tourist, the horse looks foreign to me. - Doesn't look like the type to put up a good fight. (bells jingling) I guess nobody told him he can't ride through our territory without permission. - Why don't you teach him a lesson? (shouting) (groaning) - Thanks. - Philonus. - Uh huh? - What are you waiting for? Show him who's boss, eh? - Yeah. Are you lads on vacation or something? Attack that stranger! He's trespassing! (chuckling intimidatingly) (suspenseful music) (shouting) (weapons clanging) (hitting and punching) (smacking) (shouting) (wobbling music) (shouting) - Can't you fools do anything without me? Now stand back and watch me bring him to his knees. - Great words. - Engarde, stranger. Up til now we've only been kidding with you, fight back! (smacking) (groaning) - Uh huh, only kidding, eh? (shouting) (weapons clanging) (smacking) (shouting) (clamoring in fright) - Cunicula, you know what you are? You're a lousy Jonah! - Hey, wait for me, where you going? I'm not a Jonah. It was you who wanted me to molest him. (chuckles) - Whoa! (shouting) (playful music) (weapons clanging) (shouting) (smacking) (gentle music) (bells jingling) (mysterious music) (vocalizing) (shouting) - Are you the head man of these people? - Yes. - As of today, your village is under our protection and you'll be taxed accordingly. - But this is one of Dharma's villages and we're under his protection. A quarter of all we produce goes to him and we need the rest to survive. - We don't want your produce, we only want one thing. The sacred fire. Share it, or suffer for it. - Only Dharma knows the secret of the sacred fire. - Then tell me where to find him, old man. - You can kill me, and everyone else here, but Dharma, nobody can kill. For four centuries he's ruled over the people of this valley but where he lives, no one knows. - Then how do you make him aware that you need his protection? - When such a need arises, he appears out of nowhere without warning. - You lie, old man, you lie. - No! - Then why doesn't your Dharma appear now to save you from us? (explosion booms) (horses neighing wildly) - [Dharma] I am Dharma! - [Amazon Warrior] After him! (shouting) (explosions booming) (horses neighing wildly) - Why are you looking up there? I give you a choice. If you leave these people in peace, you will come to no harm. If not, the power of Dharma will destroy you! - I want him alive, after him! (whimsical music) (hollering) - This way! (shouting) - This is your last warning. Raze this valley again, and none of you will leave it alive. (explosions booming) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (mysterious music) - Oh immortal Dharma, hear the plea of your humble servants. And give them the benefit of your great wisdom. (flames crackling) (wind whistling) - Here is your Dharma, my defenseless children. What is it, how do you wish me to help you? - We do not seek your help. We only wish to thank you for saving us this morning from the Amazons. - I cannot accept thanks that I have not earned. Since last night I have been in meditation with my ancestors. - [Old Man] But if it was not you, great lord, then who could it have been? - It was probably the soul of someone recently passed on. That saw that I was busy and chose as a gesture of good will to protect you. - Even if that's so, what happened this morning is still your doing. For only you have such powers. And that is why we have brought you these gifts as a sign of our appreciation and thanks. Without you, we are at the mercy of the Amazons. - Since you insist, I have no choice but to accept your presents with profound emotion and rest assured that Dharma's protection will be as strong in the future as it has been in the past. For hundreds of years it has been my destiny to defend the people of this valley and the sacred fire that burns forever is the symbol of my immortality. - Tell us, great lord, what should we do if the Amazons decide to attack our village again? - Very good, very good. Place the baskets around my feet as usual. Where are my favorite hot peppers? Don't say you've forgotten again! - I put them personally in one of the baskets, great lord. - I thought I made it quite clear, no peppers, no protection! - I assure you that they are in one of the baskets, great lord. - Ah, there they are! You wanted to know what to do, uh... - If the Amazons should return and attack! - You need say no more. If that terrible day should come, there is only one cause of action that I would advise you to take and that is to do nothing. - Nothing? - Dharma has spoken! - But they'll kill us all! - Not if you practice the art of passive resistance and put your faith in Dharma the all-powerful. - But what if... - Silence! My defenseless children, if you are attacked, you will turn to me as you have always done and I'll help you as I did today. Do not worry, my immortal presence is constantly awake and always on guard to protect you, and now my children, I leave you. Lower your eyes, bow down, bow down. (mysterious music) (flames crackling) (light music) Put out the fire, Grog, and place these baskets in the storeroom. And as for you young man, how many times have I told you not to impersonate me while I'm sleeping? - The more he talks, the less I understand him. - Now what's all this about the Amazons? - They were out in the village looking for you and I scared them off with a few of your tricks. - All these accursed women think about is making war. Well, I suppose we'll have to arrange a meeting and try to talk them out of it. - That'll be impossible. But look Dharma, if you'll allow me to expose myself to the sacred flame so attain immortality, I think I could handle them. (bubbling) Look, I know almost all your tricks now, and I know I could impersonate you perfectly if only you'd allow me to become immortal. - Come with me, hmm. (grating) Do you believe that by simply passing through the so-called sacred flames, you will become immortal, eh? - Yes, isn't that how you became immortal? All you have to do is tell me the right way to do it. I put my hand in it once, it nearly burnt my fingers off. - You did? (chuckles) Well, when you put your faith in old wives' tales. And I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I'm not immortal. - Ah, you only say that. - You don't believe me? - No. - All right then, my boy, let me ask you a question. If I really am immortal, then why am I taking such pains to teach an impetuous youth like you everything I know? To amuse myself? - Never thought of that. Hup. Maybe that's it. Gets boring doing the same thing for hundreds of years. - The only reason has been to prepare you to inherit this costume when I die. For 400 years it's been passed on from master to student. The only thing you can call immortal about Dharma, whether you like it or not, is the style of his clothes. - So you're just like any other man. - And I make mistakes like any other man. One of them being to adopt an irresponsible youth like you. You may have learned the tricks, but it is his wisdom that makes Dharma great. - If it's not true, then who invented the story of the sacred fire that gives immortality? - When the first Dharma stumbled across this cave and discovered its secret, he was inspired to call himself the keeper of the sacred fire and appear before the people of the valley behind a curtain of flame, wearing the mask I wear today. He was also... He was also the first one who levied a tax. In return for advice and protection. But as for why the fire burns at all, that's a mystery that has yet to be solved. - But without immortality, there's no way to destroy the Amazons. - If you rely purely on physical strength, you will never destroy them anyway. You must use guile. And I will decide our strategy as long as I'm alive. - How long is that gonna be? - If I have my way, as long as possible. - Well I hope I don't get tired of waiting. - Well done. But remember one thing. The more you learn now, the easier it'll be when I do pass away and you become the new Dharma. We have a heavy responsibility towards the people of this valley, and we must try never to let them down. And now it is the hour to retire and resume my meditation. Oh, and no taking advantage of my spiritual absence to steal my costume. - I intend to go hunting so you don't have to worry. Sleep well. (chuckles) - My boy, you're not as dumb as I thought you were. (gentle music) - Oh! (horse neighing) Oh, oh. (groaning) - Can I help you? - I think I sprained my ankle. - Well there's nothing broken as far as I can see. What are you doing out here alone? Where do you come from? - I lost my way. - Well I'm happy it was I who found you. - My horse shied and bolted. I fell off and twisted my foot when I landed. Surely you could do something if you looked at it. - Not me, but I know somebody who can. - Ah! - There you are. Keep your weight off it for a day or two and it'll be as good as new before you know it. Well, it's time for my meditation. Mind if I leave you? - It's the best think you could do. - Hmm, I thought that's how you felt. Well, I'll leave our guest in your hands, and, uh, don't forget she needs rest. (light music) - Glad I found you? - You know I am. But even though I want to stay with you, I must soon return to my own people. (crying out) - The Amazons! The Amazons! Must save Dharma. (mysterious music) - Here, wait for me here. Dharma, Dharma! (Fire crackling) Let me help you. (groaning) - No Aro, it's useless. Those evil savages. I tried to get them to listen, but you are right. And now you inherit the role of Dharma. Take my costume, and ride towards the east until you reach a large city. And there you will find two friends of mine, they are waiting for you. One is called Chang and the other is called Moog. The three of you will avenge me. - But what if they refuse to help me? - They also seek immortality, and they know that Dharma is the one person. Aro, all you have to do is pull the wool over their eyes. They wanna believe so it won't be difficult. Throw my body in the fire and you must avenge me to save this valley. From the Amazons. (sighs) (birds chirping) (hollering) - Lena! - Can it be that the stories of his immortality are true? I pierced his chest with my lance. (arrow whooshes) - I want him alive. (whimsical music) After him! Get after him! Find me him! (shouting) (clamoring in foreign language) (gentle music) (smacks) - You mention that name to me again and you'll make a big mistake! - Do you need some help, friend? - Not especially. Now, tell me, why can't I mention Moog? (smacking) - You're gonna bite off more than you can chew again, let's get out of here. - What are you waiting for? Destroy him! - Keep him alive! - I heard 'ya. - Hey! - Tell me something. What are you doing with types like these? - You tell me why you're prying into other people's business. - Need some help, friend? - No thanks! - Hey you? (banging and clanking) (clamoring) (whimsical music) (thwacking) - Milady, I could not resist the urge to steal a fleeting kiss. Farewell! - Need some help, friend? - No thanks! (whooshing) (boinging) (trumpeting) (boinging) (whistling) (kicks) (groaning) - Help! - The offer is still open. - Then join in, friend! (smacking) (weapons whooshing and clanging) Go to the right. - It's just a question of time. (crashing) - Moog! - Thanks for helping out, friend. - What are you talking about? I'm trying to find a girl. - What's she look like? Well, wish you luck! - Oh, wait! (shouting) (whooshing and clanking) (smacking) Sorry. - Why don't you introduce yourself? - What's your name? - Moog. - My, that's a fine name. I think you rather like me, eh? My name is Myra. And I live in the village of Junga, not far from here at all. Perhaps you'll come to see me. Like it? I'll be expecting you. (bangs) (thwacks) (playful trumpeting) (clanking) (boinging) (light music) (hands smacking) Myra. - Philonus, Philonus. Hey, he's what's the matter with you? Philonus. Hey! Bumbling fool almost broke a cat. (clanging) (thwacking) - With my compliments. - Ah! (whistling) (smacking) (shouting) - I think the time has come for us to get the hell out of here! - I think you're right, let's go! (clamoring and shouting) - Again. Three towers of strength united... - Just give me a message. Your enchanting is more impressive in public. - You should not sneer at religious rituals. All right. You must attack as soon as you can. Wipe out all the villages, carry off or kill the young men, show no mercy. You must eliminate all resistance, leaving no one to help those three. - I'll use Mila. - No, Akela, trust me. You should not put your faith in her. - [Akela] Why not? An Amazon could never be a traitor. (gong clangs) - The sacred fire of Dharma. It's been burning like that for thousands of years. But take care, stare at it too long and the flames will blind you. - Are you trying to tell us that to attain immortality, we have to get burned? - Mm hmm. - Well it didn't hurt you, you look pretty good for 400 years old. - Look, what are we waiting for? Let's proceed with the ceremony. - Have patience, my friend. I must first consult the gods. It is only through them that I can determine when is the right moment. So while you two make yourselves at home, I shall retire to my quarters and seek their advice using the power of meditation. (snaps) (grating) - Honorable partner, if you ask me, we are being taken for a pair of fools. - Well let's hope he finds it easy to get through to the gods. - Let's hope so. - He could keep us waiting around for weeks. - If you want my opinion, I don't believe he's telling us the truth. I think that story about the gods is just to put us off. Look, let's try passing ourselves through the flames and see what happens. All right? - But what if he's telling the truth and we do get burned? - He must have done it, so we can too. - You think so, eh? - Why sure, as far as he's concerned we're just a couple of suckers. - Better a sucker than a cinder, that's what I say. Besides, we don't know the right way to do it. - It's simple, look. Just put your hand in to start. I'll bet it doesn't even get hot. - You bet me, big deal. What if I get burnt? - You win the bet. But nothing will happen, you'll see. - So why don't you try it? - Why don't I try it? I guess I could, but, uh, at the moment I don't happen to have a hand free. Go on. - All right. I'll give it a try first. (fire crackling) Hey Chang, you're right! - Try it again? - Not even a blister. - You see? What did it tell you? (hollering) (laughing) Chang, wasn't it you who said it wouldn't burn your hand? - But it didn't burn yours! What, poor me. - I used to work as a blacksmith when I was a kid, I guess that's why the fire didn't hurt me. - Why didn't you say so? - I'm sorry, I just didn't think about it. - Oh god, it's all scorched! - Well you're the one who talked me into doing it. - That's no excuse, you could have stopped me. (laughs) - May the great goddess Ares protect you! (hollering) Forward! (dramatic music) - Come on, wake up. - Ai, ugh. - What do you say? - I said, "Ai," 'cause that means ouch in dialect. - So, you put your hand in the sacred fire, hmm? - Only to see if it was hot. - All right, serves you right if you got burned. - It's okay for you. - That's right, I hope it's taught you a lesson. Without my guidance and without the approval of the gods, whoever touches those flames will get a nasty burn. We have to wait for a sign. - Hmm, what did I tell you? We've got to wait for a sign. Otherwise, will you listen, no! You talked me into it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - That right? You don't, huh? Ah, you can't fool me. (chuckling) - Yeah, you're too smart for your own good. - Oh come on, come on. This is no time to squabble. If you follow me, you can hear the decision of the gods. First, I must congratulate you on your good fortune. You have been selected to fight against the Amazons, after which you'll be able to pass through the sacred flame. And so attain immortality. - Are you sure you heard that right? - After four centuries of experience, I can guarantee the message is correct. - Couldn't they have meant the other way around, immortality and then? - One of the requirements for admittance to the ranks of the immortal is the execution of an noble deed. And in your case that means fighting the Amazons, so make your choice. - The old man's right. - Who are you calling old man? - Sorry, but you are 400 years old. - It's going to be dangerous. The Amazons are warriors. - If you don't want to earn your immortality, then I may as well go and look for someone else. - All right, if you say so. I just think it's risky. - Don't tell me you're scared! Look at you, you oughta be ashamed of yourself. I'm not afraid. - Hmph. I don't know what it is with you, you always say one thing and mean another. - All right, I'll do it (mumbles), but honorable master, there's only one thing. I can't fight with this hand. - There's no need to call me master. I'm Dharma to you. I'll look for an ointment in the old man... Old ointment I mean that I'll prepare especially from magic infusions. (suspenseful music) - At every full moon you will give us another 100 sacks of grain. - Leomides, don't give into their demands! (smacks) - Does he speak for all of you? - No, not all of us. He is young and has yet to learn restraint. - Amazons, back to camp! (dramatic music) (hollering) (screaming) - In 400 years, this is the first time I've ever seen anybody riding a cow. - It's a buffalo. - He's right. By the way, where are we going? - To the village of Junga. We have to convince the people there to fight at our side. - The village of Junga? - Yes, why? - Well it's just a place that interests me. (clamoring) - What has happened here? - [Old Man] Oh great lord, the Amazons returned and carried off the best of our young men. And 100 sacks of grain. - The come has come to fight back. - How, great lord? We are at the mercy of these evil women. Better to pay their taxes than to be massacred. - And to allow your young men to be carried off as slaves? (gentle music) - At last, come. Oh, I was almost sure you would force me to ride away with you, and I feel so weak and defenseless. - Why, I'd rather die before I lifted a finger against you. - Oh, when I think how strong you must be, I don't think I'll ever be able to resist you. Tell me how. - Didn't you hear what I said? I have no intention of forcing you. - No, but won't you do anything to possess me? Don't you like me or something? How about if I kiss you? (laughing playfully) - Well, what do you think? - Oh great lord, it was you who told us that we should seek to live in peace. Times have changed Leomides. - You must listen Leomides, we must resist! We'll be wiped out if we listen to you! - The boy is right. You must give us time to decide, great lord. Go to the other villages. If they decide to fight, then we will too. - [Aro] Moog! Moog, in the name of the gods, where are you? - You have to go now. I live for the day when you return and carry me off. - [Aro] Oh great Dharma, where the hell is he? Moog! (sighs) - See you soon, my little goddess. (laughing) - Let's go, Moog! - What on earth's got into you too? - No you're the one who's been burned. - Burned? - I was just getting some information. - Sure, and I can't help you with a magic potion. (laughing) (fire crackling) - We've been to every village in the valley, and none of them are willing to fight. - We'll go it alone. - You know old man Dharma used to, rather I was thinking that... - That's all right, we know you're old and wise. It's our friend Moog here who lacks wisdom, suggesting we should fight the Amazons alone. - I think Moog's got a point. We should be more than a match for them. According to the gods, if we stick together, there's no force in the world capable of beating us. - And I say they're right. (dramatic music) - There's no way in from this side. - No. And unless we grow wings, we'll never get over the palisade. - That's right. There's only one answer. Learn to fly. You'll have to keep up a slow, continuous movement! - [Moog] What am I up here for if you know so much? - There can be no progress without risk. If you succeed, then all humanity is going to be indebted to you. - And if I fail, what will humanity do for me then? - Moog, you the heaviest! If you manage to fly, then it'll be easy for me! - I guess I just don't have the pioneer spirit, and if you ask me, I'm not gonna make a good pigeon. (shouting) (crashing) Slow, continuous movement, huh? Oh. (groaning) - You know, flying will work if use a different method. I guess humanity isn't ready for wings yet. I've got something better. (mysterious music) Ready? (whooshing) Jump! (whooshing) (whooshing) (clanking) - Release the prisoners. - The horses, Chang. Get the prisoners mounted and all of you ride out in the confusion. I'm going to open the main gate. - Come on, this way, hurry! (whimsical music) - Do your worst, hurry! (gong clanging) Hurry, hurry! (hollering) (dramatic music) (vocalizing) Show no pity! - Go! (shouting) (whooshing) There will be no peace for the people of this valley until those three have been captured and the vultures have consumed their bodies. (hollering) - Your escape has put us all in danger! The Amazons will come back and we'll be worse off than before. - You're wrong, Leomides. - Look, you haven't seen the way Dharma and those two friends of his can fight. If they can help us, we can defeat those women. Put it to the council of elders. - So be it, Azov. Tomorrow we will vote on whether to fight or not. - No, they're not mine. - Myra, Myra! - I have to go, that's my mother. You wait here. Keep an eye on the children. I won't be long! - Oh, if only we could get our hands on those three. That would really be an accomplishment. - Well so far we haven't had much success. How do you propose to do it? - You realize who we could deal with supposing we capture just one of them? - The Amazons? - Nah, you may be right, but every time we go to the camp for those witches, I get the feeling that we're really asking for trouble. - They're not gonna hurt us. - Yeah, sure. (light music) - We wish to request an audience with your queen. This is my squire and I am Philonus, lord of the forest within the valley. - We have information about the men who released your prisoners. - Open the gate. - Hello noble Queen of the Amazons... - May there always be peace between you, him, and me. - You let me do the talking. - Well I thought it was optional to mention me. - What is this information you have for me? - Noble queen, we have heard that you wish to penetrate the refuge into which Dharma and his friends have withdrawn. - Well we know how to do it and for a certain consideration... - You mean you can show us the secret way into the mountain? - Exactly, noble queen. - The sacred fire flows out of the mountain. - And I can show you how to acquire it. - I see, and your price? - We wish for... - Philonus, listen. - No! We ask nothing your majesty in return. - These men are under my protection. Accompany them to the guest tents and provide them with food, drink, and whatever else they want. - That sounds like a good deal, eh? - Tell the captain I wish to see him. - Thank you. We appreciate your hospitality, your highness. - You wish to see me? - We are entrusting you with command of the expedition which will capture Dharma. - If such an undertaking is possible, I shall succeed. Although I am aware it will not be easy. - [Akela] We will devise a plan. - Even so, he is still immortal and in my opinion he could be more use to us as a friend. - Friendship with Dharma would mean losing our control over the villages on the other side of the mountain. - Your desire to increase our power in that valley will become the reason for our downfall! - Enough, enough Mila, you have not been called here to protest our decisions but to receive orders. And as a military commander, you will obey those orders without question. Capture Dharma, I want him in my power. If you fail, I advise you not to return here. You will find yourself suspended by your feet. (suspenseful music) (whooshing) (crying out) (screaming) (whooshing and smacking) (shouts) - Take your horses. - Chang, Moog! (hollering) (crashing) (wind whistling) (groaning) (chuckling) - I see no reason for you to laugh, there is no escape, your fate is sealed. You have, however, one way to save yourself. Tell me the secret of the sacred fire. Make me immortal, and in return for immortality, I will spare your life. - Since I am already immortal, my life is not at stake. - Let's see how true that is. Now that you're no longer behind that curtain of fire. - Be careful! According to the legend, whoever harms Dharma will die! (grunting) - You must not forget that until he has told us the secret, it is important to keep him alive, oh noble queen. Mila already knows where the eternal flame is. - That's no help to you. Put your finger in that fire and it'll burn up like a torch. - Every mystical ceremony is based on specific formalities and rites, we'll never learn the secret if you kill Dharma. - Very well. Torture will persuade you to tell us all you need to know. - Allow me time to consult the gods. I must seek their cooperation. (chuckles) (blowing) - I'm not worried, Dharma's not going to die. Even if they try roasting him. He's immortal. - But we're not and we never will be if he doesn't come back. What the hell are we waiting for, to grow old? No, we gotta free him. - I thought you had arranged for Meme to meet us outside the gate with the horses. Well she isn't here, so what do you expect us to do, walk all the way? - Get out of sight! She probably got lost, do you see what I see? Two horses. - You figure... - What are we waiting for? - Love, Philonus. You really mean to tell me that you want to run off with a couple of horses? We don't even know who they belong to. - Either we steal them or else we walk home so you better make up your mind what you wanna do. - I think I did already. - Well? - I don't like walking. - Okay, we'll take 'em by surprise. The best way will be to close... - And hit 'em when they're not looking. What if it happens to be those two friends of Dharma's? We'll be flat on our backs before we know it. But come to think of it, I got what we want right here. You know what this is? It's a secret weapon, that's what it is. - If you're not gonna help me then I'll have to handle it by myself! Forward! Surge! (mysterious music) (shouting) - I give up, I give up, it was my idea. (grunting) - If you let me go, I'll save your life. - I'm beginning to pity you. Where did you come from this time, huh? Where did you come from? - We've been to the Amazons. They're old friends of ours and they're always happy to see us. We come and go whenever we please. - Well he's telling you he's a friend of the Amazons. - That's right, and if you don't believe it, I'll give you some proof! We saw Dharma being questioned by the queen. - I don't believe a word you're saying. Why don't you tell us how you caught him if you want him to open up? - As we approached the gate, I give him a hail. "Advise your noble queen that Philonus "and his humble squire request an audience." They open up without even looking at us. - That's all you do? - Yeah that's all, and once we're in the camp, we walk around and go wherever we please. And I'll tell you something else... (smacks) (groaning) (warbling music) (chuckles) (laughing slowly) (mysterious music) - Advise your noble queen that Philonus and his humble squire request an audience. - I knew you'd get here. - You did, huh? - Yeah. - Suppose you know how to get away too, huh? - Where there's a will, there's a way. Come on, hurry. It's coming. Let's get out of here. (whips) (shouts) (crying out) Mina, you hurt? There, he knows here. (moaning sexily) If you two have reached an honorable agreement, it would be a good idea for us to get out of here. - A man sure knows how to handle a woman. Come on. If you're ready, let's go. (whimsical music) Quick, over this precipice. - We can't escape that way! - Don't be so sure. Here, take this. Here's one for you. (grunts) Here. Now, grab the corners, hold it over your heads, and jump. - Ay yay yay, how do you know this works? - I don't, you'll find out on the way down. - Ay yay yay. (whooshing) (gong clanging) (laughing) (arrows whooshing) (whistling) Now all we need is horses. Hey. - I happened to be passing by. I can lend them to you if you'd like. - Lend them to the great Dharma. I'll take Mila with me. - You know, I may be wrong, but I'm getting the idea you're following me. - And I thought it was you who was following me. - You coming? - No I'm not. Philonus is my guardian, and even if he's a bandit it would be wrong to desert him. - Well how do you like that? When you next see your guardian, you can give him our thanks for helping us get away. Hyah, hyah! - Advise your noble queen that Philonus and his humble squire Cunicula greet her and request an audience. (arrows whooshing) Hey, didn't you hear, we wanna speak to the queen? - You are speaking to her, you vermin, and I now give you fair warning. Keep well away from here if you value your lives. Fire! (arrows whooshing) - Look, if you listen to a word of advice from me for once Philonus, I think we'd better get out of here. I mean before one of those arrows finds its mark. You stay if you like, but I'm going. - Get back at that butch if it's the last thing I do. Hey, where'd you go? She might at least have told us what we've done wrong. (clamoring) - I knew I'd see you again. - Good news for you, Dharma. - Leomides and the council of elders has voted in favor of war, and the other villages have too. - My friends, the Amazons will try to destroy your village. There's no need to panic, though, we have plenty of time to get ready. According to their custom, they will not launch an attack before the full moon. That means we still have eight days, and that's more than enough time to prepare a surprise or two. I know that with hard work and some luck too we'll put them to rout. (villagers cheering) All right Chang, let's go. Find Moog, we'll start at once. - This is the forest at the lower end of the valley. You can count on Akela to come through there. - That's just what we want. - Our plan depends on the men from the other villages attacking at the right moment. What's he looking for? - I don't know. (bubbling) - You know something about that smell? Well the sacred fire, it smells the same way. (chuckles) (chattering) (whooshing) (crashes) (cheering) - I am sorry Leomides, but we've talked it over again and we are not prepared to risk the lives of our men by fighting against the Amazons. - You mean you decided that now? At the last moment? - You must understand that there was much to debate, much discussion before the decision was taken. Listen to reason, Leomides, you have no chance of winning. It's a lost cause. There is still time to escape into the hills with us. - That's not true. There's not even time to warn Dharma. The full moon is risen. (mysterious music) - [Villager] I blocked the neck with the rope to keep the liquid in. - [Villager] What are these things for? - [Villager] it's a new weapon, Dharma showed us how to make it. (suspenseful music) (hollering) - Amazon warriors! Forward! (dramatic music) (vocalizing) (explosions whistling and booming) (horses neighing wildly) Rally to me, to me! To the river, to the river! (explosions whistling and booming) Back to the village! - Where's that? - Rally to me! (explosions booming) (horses neighing wildly) Get behind the palisades! (screaming) - Attack, attack! (horn blowing) (hollering) (dramatic music) (shouting) (explosions booming) (whooshing) (cries out) (groaning) - Moog can hold them back. If we capture the queen, we're safe. Half of you that way, the rest that way. Hurry! (whimsical music) (smacking) (shouting) Behind you, they broke through! (shouting) - That's the way, teach those evil witches a lesson they won't forget! - Why don't we help? - We should, but we don't have any weapons. (clattering) - Well how do you use it? - Use it? This little invention's right out of the future. This insignificant ball will pulverize the whole world. (shouting) (clanging) (smacking) (shouting) - What happened to the reinforcements? Leomides must have backed down. - He'd better come up with something soon or we'll lose our skins as well as immortality. - Well, we haven't lost anything yet. I've prepared a little surprise for our friends. Get to the cave as soon as you've taken care of our visitors. (whooshing) - How many have you got? - A whole bag full. More than we need, Philonus. - You and I may be prepared to go down there, but what about the others? - So are we. - If this weapon works, we'll be heroes! - Philonus, we must hurry or the Amazons will win and kill everybody! - All right, each man will arm himself with a new weapon. Our surprise attack will be the turning point in the battle. Victory will be our triumph. And in future those witches will respect the name Philonus! - And his humble squire, of course. - Hmph. (whimsical music) (weapons whooshing and clanging) - Get ready, my hearties! It is within our grasp to free this valley from female tyranny! Ready, forward! - Charge! - Come on! - Forward! (laughing) (whooshing) Now what? - I guess it has to be perfected. - Idiot. What do we do now, Meme? - We fight anyway. - Right, let's go. - It should have been tested. - Now you tell me! (dramatic music) (weapons whooshing and clanging) (shouting) (groans) (shouting) - Let's get out of here! - Run for your lives! (arrows whooshing) (groaning) (shouting) (thwacking) (whimsical music) - Flank number two, full speed ahead. - Full speed ahead! - Flank number three, ignite flames. (flames whooshing) - Left, right, left, right. Keep those (mumbles) clear to your right. - I can't see to the right, I got a guy with a limp on the left! - Left, right, left, right, (mumbles) left, right. - Retreat into the woods! - Can't you keep those flames straight? - I'm trying, I got a man on the right with a limp now. - Left, left, left, left, left right left. (flames whooshing) - Hold steady, Amazons. Fight to the end! - Forward my hearties, now's the time to save the day! Open the gate, open the gate, come on, move! - Forward Amazons, hold your ground! Fight back! (crashing) (thwacking) (shouting) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (screaming) - Kneel down my brothers and listen to my words. Prostrate yourselves. (laughing) My noble allies, I say goodbye to you. I go now to a place that is not of this earth. (fire crackling) You must have faith, you must have patience. I will teach you the secrets of immortality when I return. Farewell! (creaking) - What does he mean, farewell? Where did he go? We've been tricked!
