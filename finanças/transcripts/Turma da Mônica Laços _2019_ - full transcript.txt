So. As soon as they leave the ice cweam stand they will see Fluffy faint. -How will you do that? -Just listen, easy! How? As soon as they pick up Fluffy you will tell them: "There is a vetewinawy acwoss the woad!" But there is no veterinary across the road. Thewe will be! I will put up a sign that says "Vetewinawy". That's it! Okay, Plan Master. Do your thing! Wait, let me finish! So, this is how it's going to happen: They will wun with fainted Fluffy to the vet, and I will be by the door disguised as a secuwity guard and I will say: "either the stuffed wabbit or the dog, you can't come in with both". That's it! What do you think? I think if you say "stuffed rabbit" they will notice. Just say "stuffed toy"! -Why? -Guess why? Oh, yeah. "Either the dog or the stuffed toy!" -Better? -Mm-hmm! And how are we going to get Fluffy to faint? -Ha, I got you now! -Not weally! -You are very prepared, huh? -I planned evewything! -We will see... -Wanna bet? -Yes! -Follow me. Okay! Cabelol: what is the secret of this magic formula? "In a survey carried out in the Limoeiro neighborhood, it was clear that the majority of the users are very happy with the regrowth of their hair. The results are astonishing, but so far no one has discovered the secret of this magic formula, a true mystery". -What is the magic formula called, love? -Cabelol. Cabelol! It's a scam, it's absurd! I don't know why daddy worries so much about his hair when we love daddy's bald head! -Morning, morning! -Listen you two! Listen, you two, breakfast is... Come, Fluffy, come! Where's my boy? Show him evewything you learned! How long will this take, Jimmy Five? Because I've to have lunch soon. Let's show him, Fluffy. Come with me! Fluffy? Fluffy, wake up! Come on! Why did you do this to your...? I twained him to faint with this! It's a whistle that only dogs can hear. Okay, but how do we wake him up? Fluffy, come here! I told you this plan is flawless! It could work! -Good morning! -Good morning! I'll have the usual, please! A scoop of strawberry and one of chocolate for Monica. -Yes! -How about you Maggy? What flavor? I'll have chocolate, strawberry, pineapple and mint. -He's got to be joking! -Who? Who do you think? I told him to remove all of them! Fluffy? Fluffy! Come here, Fluffy! So cute! -Fluffy! -He's so cute! He is... you wouldn't think he belongs to Jimmy Five. Fluffy? -Fluffy? Fluffy? -Wake up! -Fluffy! -It's serious! -Somebody help us! -Help! -How did this happen? -I don't know! Fluffy? There's a new veterinary clinic right there. -Okay, thanks! -Hold this. -Dogs only, stuffed toys aren't allowed. -Thanks! We need to come in! Dogs only, stuffed toys aren't allowed. No! I need both! Either the dog or the stuffed toy. -You can't take both. -Why not? Stuffed toys create chaos among the dogs. No, I'm not gonna give you my Samson. Move out of the way! My ice cream! Jimmy Five! Wun, Smudge! Come, Fluffy! Fluffy? So, these black ones are quite rare because they come from an old soft drink -which I didn't even... -Wun, Smudge! -And where did you find them? -I found them... Move! The most beautiful apple for the most beautiful girl in the world! Get down, Smudge! Sorry, Bucky. Bucky, are you okay? Why didn't you stop him, Mr. Juca? -Hi, Mr. Juca! -Hi, Maggy! -Two hot dogs, please. -Two hot dogs. -Hi, boys. -Hi, Bella! Fluffy, a friendly warning: Don't mess with Monica. You'll never have my Samson. This time Monica was harsh. She really hurt me. It was like in a video game. How does that shorty wun so fast? It's like Samson is made out of rocks. Yes... But my new plan will be flawless. No, no! This is getting boring! I can't, my mum is always complaining when I get home hurt. Let's play, let's do something else! Smudge, do you think I have time to play? I need to get Samson so I can be our stweet wuler. -And what are you? -Vice-wuler, of course. So, what do you think? Are you in? The problem is... Your plans never work. Smudge... But the next one will. Do you know what? Do it alone. Looks like it's just you left. Come, let's go! -It was Monica... -Really? Was Smudge with you? He doesn't want to be part of my plans anymore. He says they never work. Maybe your friend wants to do something else. What he doesn't understand is that if we get Samson we wule our stweet. Sometimes friends are like that, love. One moment you play something they want to and the next they play something you want to. But he doesn't understand I need to defeat Monica. Are you sure this is what you want? Go rest... He's mine... He's mine... Samson is mine!! Fluffy! Fluffy? -Mum, did you see Fluffy? -No my love, isn't he out there? Fluffy! Dad, have you seen Fluffy? No! Fluffy! Fluffy? Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy? Hey, Jimmy! I brought visitors. Hi, Jimmy Five! -Monica and I baked you a carrot cake. -Hi. If you want it. Oh, and... Sorry about yesterday, okay? I got a little carried away. Don't worry, Fluffy will come back. Everyone is looking for him. Our parents are looking for him! This isn't the Jimmy Five I know. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I think it's to cheer you up but... Devise a plan. Go get them. We have 122 posters. We have to put them up awound town. And see if anyone has any information about Fluffy. -Make it a big one! -A big one? Is this for you or for Monica? -For me, of course! -Have you seen a little doggy? -His name is Fluffy. -No. He is about this size... -Good morning! -Good morning! Do you know anything about this dog? -No, I don't. -Have you seen this dog? I'm very wowwied. And you? And you? -Have you seen this dog? -No... I haven't, have you? Okay, thanks. -Have you seen this dog around? -No. -Not around here. -Thank you very much. Bye! Get off! I can't even be left in peace. -Hi, Mister! -Hi! Can we put this poster up here? -Oh, did you lose your dog? -Yes! Our friend's dog. Is he green? Yes... Okay, put it up there. -I hope you find him. -Thank you! -Bye! -Bye, thank you! Bye, bye! Calm down, kids! Let's organize this! You talk first. Did you see anything peculiar yesterday or today? I see a lot of peculiar things every day. Something specific, a gween dog... The most peculiar thing I saw... a man who was walking around, here and there. Tall? Short? Neither tall nor short, more or less my height... -Medium. -Carrying a sack on his back. -What was in the sack? -I didn't see. But whatever it was, it was moving. -Moving? -What size sack? Between this size and this size. And... did he have a beard? He had a mad man's beard. A bit bigger than mine. -What was his hair like? -I couldn't see... He was wearing a cap. Okay, so... Is this him? Yes, I think that's him! Yes, that's exactly him. Guys, we have a composite sketch! -We have a composite sketch! -Bye! -Nobody wants a balloon? -No, no! Bye! They come full of questions and don't buy a single balloon... Where shall I put it? Here? -A bit further up. -That's it. Brother, what is going on here? The poster you put up is covering ours! -Our dog! -We are trying to find Fluffy. Listen, Bro, get your ugly dog off our poster. -Come on, off you go! -Guys, it's better we leave. -Yes, you better! -Better! Guys, it's just that I am vewy wowwied about him! Have you seen this dog... -I am vewy wowwied! -Where do you sleep? In a baby crib? -You can't even talk properly! -Big Baby! Jimmy Five, let's go. They're not worth fighting with. -Go home! -Go home, big baby! What do we have here? -Give it back! -No! -What an ugly drawing! -Give it back now! -Horrible drawing! -Give it back to him. -Who did this? -That's right! -Listen to shorty over here! -Yes, listen to shorty! -Buck-toothed and brave! -Are you angwy? Plucked up the courage to talk to us? -Very brave! -You can call her all the names you want! -She doesn't mind! -Really, shorty? -You are too tall for her. -That's right, too tall! Now we're talking. It's not worth fighting them. You taught me that. Here, take it, bucktooth! Watch out for shorty! -So brave. -Oh no, be careful! Give us a smile so we can see your teeth! Here bucktooth, take it! -They called her bucktooth... -And shorty! Stop! Please stop! Okay, we know who the man in the sketch is. It's the same man who took our dog, Apollo. -Where is he? -We don't know. Where have you looked? In the Swallows Park. -Nobody needs to know about this. -Nobody! I'll get her later. Okay, okay, calm down! One at a time. -Who did the sketch? -Jimmy Five! What a wonderful drawing, son! Who is it? -The man with the sack! -He took Fluffy! He cawwies a black sack on his back that moves. And how do you know this? Are you sure about this? Yes! Absolutely. -Hi, guys. -Hi... Did you find anything, love? No. I've looked everywhere and nothing. -Nothing for now. -Dad, this is the man who took Fluffy. -Who? -Yes, the Man With The Sack. He hangs around the Swallows Park. -Jimmy Five drew it. -Great drawing, son. -Dad, it's twue, we're not playing. -I know you're not playing. -Listen. -We know who took him. Guys, calm down. This is for us to deal with. -Let us come with you. -You have to wait here. Do you trust Daddy? I'll bring Fluffy home. Okay? I'm coming with. -Really nice drawing. The key! -Really nice. -Really nice. We didn't... -He's desperate, James. We'll be right back. Guys... They left the sketch on the table. Adults know nothing about dogs. -Nothing! -Nothing at all! We know evewything about Fluffy. -We've to go after him. -Where? -Swallows Park. -Alone? -Yes, Smudge. -It's too dangerous, Jimmy Five! What if our parents find out? We're doomed. And what if he spends more time away from us? He might never come home. We don't even know if the guys from up the road are telling the truth. What if it was your pet? I'm in. Thinking about it... I'm in too. Guys! -Let's stop by that tree over there. -Okay! -What now? Which direction? -I don't know, I've to think. Maggy, are you seriously going to eat now? It's just an apple, Monica. There's more. Guys, let's stay alert. Anything could be a clue. Like that? Good boy! Good boy! -I'm sure it's him. -Me too! -I've a plan! -What if we... Genius at work. Maggy goes in from the right, Smudge from the left. Monica and I thwough the middle to get Fluffy. You guys distwact him. Okay? Wait. Where is he? What are you doing here? Give us Fluffy back! Who? Fluffy, my dog! What do you mean? Is your dog missing? -You didn't take him? -No! I pick up cans, scrap and cardboard... But never dogs. I've my own dog! Big Mike. Do you want to meet him? Jimmy, he didn't take Fluffy. Then who did? Forgive me for not having more comfortable chairs. No worries! You've got good food and no shower, this is a 6 star resort and, best of all: no swimming pool! Something smells good... -What are you cooking? -Beans. Smells amazing. I've added bits of sausages to it. You're hungry already, aren't you, Maggy? Have you by any chance seen this man? When I found Big Mike... he was wandering in the forest. He'd been so badly treated, he couldn't even stand up properly. Wasn't it, Big Mike? The man you're looking for... I think he lives in an abandoned hut in the middle of the forest. I always see smoke coming out of the chimney. And how do we get there? At the bottom of the park, the forest starts. Through the middle should be the shortest route. But forget it, it's too dangerous for you. You better go around it. You'll get there later but... Alive. How much further? Double the distance. I don't have time. But this forest is too dangerous for you at night. There are things in there that aren't from this world. Who goes in doesn't normally come out. I must go. -Jimmy, did you just hear him? -Are you sure you want this? I do. For Fluffy. Then I'll come with. I'll come too. Thank you. Bye... Bye, Big Mike. Bye, thanks. Bye... Bye, friend. I'll never forget you. Bye, Big Mike. Remember to follow east and look for the smoke. Thank you! This way... No, Jimmy. Follow me, I know where it is. -I'm telling you it's this way. -And I'm telling you... You guys are fighting! Guys, look at that! What? -That dark cloud! -Smudge, look at the size of this cloud. And it's not dark! And look at how many clouds there are here. -Don't worry. -But, what if... They start to breed? -And have lots of babies and... -Breed? -Smudge, calm down. -Smudge, do you think that... -It will not have babies. -Come on guys, let's go. In fact this cloud looks like... -A hot dog! -Hot dog? I'd love one now... DANGER! NO TRESPASSING If we go down, we won't be able to get back up. Are you sure this is the way, Jimmy? The man said that thwough the fowest is faster. Guys, let's go back. Didn't you see the sign? But what about Fluffy? What do we do now? Wait. I've to think. -Jimmy! What if we... -Wait! -What if we... -Wait, Smudge! -What if, Monica and I... -Maggy! Genius at work, okay? I know! Hey, fwiends! Look who's here! How is the search for the doggy going? -What's his name again? -Fluffy! -I'll take care of it. -Not this time! -Oh, how cute! -Look at her! -Such cuties! -What are they gonna do? Monica, do something! There's nothing I can do, Jimmy! Look at them! Girls... Attack! Give it to me! Come back, Jimmy! -Come, quick! -Come, Smudge! Run! Let go of my food! -It's mine now! -Armpit attack! Wun, guys! -What now? -What are we gonna do? Let's go, bro. My legs! I think a fatty has landed on them. -A fatty? -Guys, this is not the time. All I'm saying is that it's hurting. That's all. I lost my shoes. -Me too. -Me too. Wow, you guys always lose your shoes. Mine are still on my feet! Didn't you learn how to tie your laces? Help! Anybody there? Can anyone help us? I knew this wouldn't work. -Now we have to follow east. -Wait, hang on. We better mark the way with these ribbons. So if we get lost we just follow them back. Thank you. Thanks. Shall we go? Hello? Hi, Mrs. Jane, it's Louise here. How are you? -Hi, Louise, I'm okay. -Did Fluffy turn up? Not yet. Oh, no, what a shame. Well, you know that if you need anything just let me know. I know, thank you so much. I'm calling because Monica forgot her pajamas at home. Can Jimmy lend her one? A pajama for Monica? What do you mean? Well, she said she was gonna sleep at your house tonight. Isn't she there? No, I thought they were with you. As I'm pwepared, I bwought a flashlight each. -Thanks, Jimmy. -Take this one, Monica. -Thanks. -Shall we go? Are you scared, Monica? No, I'm not. It's not funny. -Are you sure you want to continue, wimp? -Yes, I am. Okay, follow the leader then. -B, C, D... -What are you doing? -Singing the ABC! -Are you sewious? -Were you scared? -You are a scared baby! I ain't scared of no ghosts! You are! I'm not scared of ghosts or lost souls. Okay, let's go. Holy moly! Take him, he stinks more than me! You go! I swear I'll bathe if I'm spared! And I... swear I won't take Samson fwom Monica. -Really? -And I won't come up with flawless plans. You look like two fools! Are you scared, Jimmy? It was just another flawless plan! -You just didn't know! -Exactly! So you already knew -that we were going to do this? -"A flawless plan!" -Yes! -Mm-hmm. -And you fell for it like a dummy! -And you can't act. -Dummy? -Come, we're wasting time. So now you want to change the subject? -We should stop to sleep. -And eat. Okay, but far from this place. Guys, shall we stop here? Okay. This one is mine. I heard The Man with the Sack takes childwen and not dogs. I heard he turns children into soap. -Soap? -What do you mean soap? -What's wrong, Smudge? -Is there something wrong? No, it's just that... When I was little my mum used to say that if I didn't bathe The Man with the Sack would get me. I don't think the threat worked. -Did you hear that? -I did. -Is it the Man with the Sack? -Maybe... or an animal. I have a plan, guys. While twhee sleep one stays awake watching. This one wakes this one and this one wakes this one. -What do you think? -I like it. -Good idea. -I like it too. I'll be the first one. -I'll be second. -I'll be last. I'll be the third then. So, Monica... just in case and for our safety... you could lend me Samson. Wow... Of course... -Then I could... -Not! I will not give you my Samson. Maggy, put this next to you. Let's sleep. Good night, guys. Good night. Thanks, bro. The kids came here and talked about The Man with a Sack. Man with the Sack? Who's that? I don't know, I thought Jimmy was being creative. You know how the kids are. I'm sorry, guys... No, don't worry! Mrs. Jane, this is a crazy story. No one would've believed it. Do you remember anything else? I don't know, I was so worried about Fluffy. -So I didn't pay much attention. -Love... The kids will be here soon. We just need to look for them. -Yes. -Shall we go? They couldn't have gone far. -No, not at all. -Can you lend me a flashlight? You'll wake the whole forest like this! Who are you? And who are you? -I asked you first. -And I asked you last. I'm Jimmy Five. Who are you? I am what you see. What do you see? A man with cwazy hair who looks like he's going to a costume party. Costume party? What a brilliant idea, Jimmy Nine! Jimmy Five. I've been to many costume parties. In the palaces, in the planets, in the parishes. Look at this! What's happening here, now. Can't you see? That one: dressed up as a firefly. Jamie Jameson Smith. He was a plane pilot! Miss Maddy! How are you? That one there: was born inside a crystal ball. And was water crazy in her childhood. Jimmy Nine! This is Elijah. The best tree electrician ever! The best leaf mechanic I know! Look! Look! It was all him! All of it! You are vewy cwazy. Crazy... Me? And how about you? Tell me about yourself, Jimmy Nine. Talking to a stranger in a forest in the middle of the night. Alone. But I'm not alone, I'm here with my fwiends. -What? What's wrong? -This is truly crazy. -What? -Jimmy Nine. Just think about it! Go to a forest in the middle of night is strange enough... Now imagine convincing your friends to go with you! But they are my best fwiends. One only needs friends when he doesn't believe he can do it all by himself. Friendship is crazy! You don't need friends! -You are gonna drive me cwazy. -I'm just playing the opposite game. It's easy! If you want to say you like it, just say you don't! If you want to tell the truth, just tell a lie! -I don't get it. -Neither do I. Give it back! Give it here! When the time comes, you have to wemember. Together you can overcome any challenge. Separated... it's not crazy to imagine the worst. Are you still playing the opposite game? Could it be? You can't be normal for a single minute, can you? Is there anything more boring than being normal? I need to watch my fwiends. Sensible. I have to stay awake. But I don't think I can. I'll keep you company. Trust me! How can I trust you if I don't even know your name? Licurgo Orival Umbelino Cafiaspirino de Oliveira. I don't think I'll wemember. Let's abbreviate. What is madness, Jimmy Nine? -Are you Jimmy Five's mum? -Yes, I am. -Do you know where he is? -Tell her Big Bob. You can tell me! Monica. Wake up. Maggy, wake up! Smudge, wake up! I don't want to go to school. Close the window! -Guys, I didn't take my turn watching. -Me neither! Jimmy Five... you watched the whole night? The whole night? Thank you. Thanks, Jimmy! Well done! You finally did something right. I agree, Smudge. Let's have some breakfast. Let's. Maggy? -Jimmy, where do we go now? -We have to go... It's the house, we found it! -I don't know if I'll get there. -Me neither. -I'll be hungry all day. -Guys, I've apologized already! I can't control myself. -Do some therapy! -Smudge, you're afraid of water! Guys, I'm very tired. Let's stop for a while. -Smudge, we have to continue. -Only if someone carries me. -We have to go, Smudge! -Are we or are we not Monica's gang? No. We're Jimmy Five's gang. -Monica's gang. -Here we go... I thought we were Jimmy Five's gang. You thought wrong. I think we are Jimmy Five's Gang. Who is stronger? Who is smarter? Me! Oh, boy... Good morning... -Can you help us? -Yes, of course. Let's go see. Just over there. The bikes! Guys, the park boundary is this way. Let's go. I'm tired... I want my mum... What else could happen? Oh. My. God. East is this way. Yes, but there's water over there. What if I carry you? You could drop me. We can jump on the rocks. But I could slip. How about a boat? It can sink. I know! A stone path. Guys. Sorry, it's not gonna happen. What do you mean? We don't have time, Smudge. We'll find a way. Jimmy, he's our friend. A good friend. An now I have to find a way! What do we do now, officer? Well, we're gonna call the helicopter rescue team. -Just find them, please. -We will. AP, Clóvis. I knew there was another way. Monica, please tell Jimmy Five it didn't even take that long. Monica, please tell Smudge that a little water never killed anyone. Monica, please tell these two babies that they're right next to each other. -What? -I need more raw material. It's difficult to find. There are no dogs left in town. I'll have to charge extra. Well, bring me the best you have. -The usual place? -Yes. -Cash only. -Okay. See you soon. What's that noise? I think it's my stomach. Maggy, where does this hunger come from? I don't know, I think there's a monster in my belly. It's stronger than me. I'm afraid he'll break free. Just one second guys. We have to go this way. Maggy! All I do is get in the way, sorry. I better leave. Hurry up, Maggy! But this dog isn't furry. But he's got a pedigree. That's not how it works. I need more fur. No fur, no fat, No fat, no formula. And no formula, no hair growth. I have a hairy one. But it's green. Green? Double the price. Okay. I need it today. Guys, I think we better go back. We're not going back, Smudge. -We have to continue. -Well, then... -let's ask for help. -When we asked nobody helped us. Yes! Which way do we go now? This one obsviously. No, Jimmy. This one! Monica, we have to go this way. No, we have to go this way. -I know this is the wight way. -And I know this is the right way. -Monica, it's here. -Here. -I'm sure it's this way. -I'M sure it's this way. We have to go this way. Why don't you listen to me? You're the one not listening. -Monica, we'll go this way. Twust me. -Why do you always want to be the leader? And why do you always want to wule our stweet? -Twust me! -But we're here together. -Why does everything have to be your way? -Because I'm smarter. But your plans never work. My plans do work, shorty, bucktooth! So? I'm sorry, Monica. I'm sure this is the house. -Me too! -Look at the smoke. -True! -But we have a problem... How do we get in? Monica, he's looking at Samson! Do you want me to throw it to him? In your dreams! Thwow it as far as possible. Come! Come, quick. Guys, this way. -I have a plan! -Are you insane? There is a crazy man inside and a giant dog and you want to play genius? This is not a game, Smudge! Smudge... Just think that when it's all over we can celebrate with pizza -with Fluffy. -Okay. -Smudge... this plan will be flawless. -Jimmy, I've known you for a long time. I've never seen a single plan work. Do you by any chance have a plan? My plan was always to go home. -I have one. We could... -This is how it's going to work: Each one will have to use their abilities to get the keys. Maggy is vewy skinny. Monica is vewy stwong. And Smudge... wuns as fast as the wain. And you? I know how to annoy people the best. This is the only part of the plan that will work. It's true. Enough! Silence! Silence! Enough! All clear! Stop it! Enough! Maggy! Enough! Enough! Smudge! He's coming! Jimmy, do something! Please, do something! Enough! Enough! Where is it? Maggy, excuse me! Hey! Hey! Come back here! Come on, Smudge! Hey! Come! Attack me! Come and get me! Ha! The doggy can't get me, huh? Fluffy, finally! -Where's Jimmy? -He's coming with Fluffy! Let's go! It's not this one! -Try this one! -This one! Come on, Smudge! -Smudge, quick! -Come on, hurry! Smudge, he's coming, hurry! Come on! Quick! He's coming! -Come on! -Smudge!! Let go! -Come here! -Let me go! -Let us go now, do you hear me? -Come! Let me go! Mister! Stop hurting me! I'm serious, let me go! Come, come! -You. You... and you! -Fluffy! -We know what you do! -Oh, really? And what do I do? You steal dogs! I'll take care of you after lunch. What's for lunch? Stay. Guys! Jimmy Five. -I have a plan. -That's the last thing I wanted to hear. Go on... The plan is to... listen to you. I like this new dynamics. Are you serious, Jimmy? Are you okay? Any ideas? This plan is flawless. I think this will be the only time I'll agree. That's because we did together. Well, it's not perfect, but it'll do. For this plan to work, we'll need bait. Like... A stuffed toy! -I'll not give it to you. -This is no game, Monica. -We need him. -No way! It's the only way to get out of the cage. I'm not giving it to you. This is sewious. We need Samson. What if you use it as bait and then steal it? -Then you hit him. -How? Without my Samson? I'm not twying to steal him, I'm sewious. -Twust me, at least once. -You've made knots in his ears before. A million times. How can I trust you? I'm not playing. I swear. On who? Whose gang? All four of us. Who? Monica's gang. Give it to him. We need him now, Monica. No. Monica, Monica! Without him we'll never leave. This is sewious. -He'll be back. -I need him. -Give it back, Jimmy. -You crazy? Trust him. Stay. Can't get us now, huh? The tables have turned. Guys, Fluffy! Do something! -Great meeting you! -Bye! Hey, Fluffy! Hey, my fwiend! I missed you! -Jimmy! -Come here, Fluffy! -We did it! -I told you this plan was flawless. Finally a plan that worked. Because we did it together! Yes! We did it! We did it! -Hello? -Hi, mum! -Son! -I'm okay... They are fine! -Son... -We found Fluffy! It's twue! -Where is he? -Where are you, love? Calm down... I don't know where we are, all I know it's a house in the middle of the fowest. Do you pwomise to come and get us? Just follow the wed wibbons thwough the fowest. Don't worry. Mummy loves you. We're coming to get you. Okay? Don't worry. We're coming to get you. AP, Clóvis. The kids are fine, tell the parents. -What a shame! -What are you going to do now? -Apollo! -Jimmy, aren't you forgetting something? Oh yes! Hold him a minute, please. Fluffy! A pleasure doing business with you. Jimmy Five! -Hi, mum! -Hi, my love! -Hi, mum, I got you a sweet corn. -Have you eaten? Maggy... One at a time. Give one to dad. Who wants some? No, thank you. What a lovely kiss. This story is so sad... How dare they do that to these dogs? Thankfully, no one else will use this Cabelol. -This is over now, love. -Yes!

You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen! And now... I dedicate this apple to you. Bucky, you're so sweet! Do you want an orange? Thank you. And... a biscuit? And a sweet corn? Hey, Jimmy! Smudge, this plan will be flawless. You'll be dressed as a baby, and then, when she's distwacted, you'll get her Samson. Monica, the window! Let's take a... shower? Baby don't want, baby don't want!
