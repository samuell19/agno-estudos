Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick [DOG MALE VOICE] What is the meaning of life? Are we here for a reason? Is there a point to any of this? [SQUEAKY BARKING] First, I had no idea what was going on. I... I couldn't see a thing. It was warm. [CHUCKLING] There was my mother. - [YIPPING] - Every day, I had fun. Was having fun the point? The whole point? No, it couldn't be that simple. (MAN) Here's one. [WHIMPERS] And then it was over. (MAN) That's it for you. No more fun. It seemed like such a short life. I mean, what exactly did I do? There was some playing. There was some eating. I dug in the dirt. But when I really thought about it, it didn't add up to much. I was back. And I was a puppy again. Alive and ready to ask the big questions. To dig for answers. Just let me in there. Um, where am I? - (MAN) So what else do you have? - [dogs barking] - Uh, this one here. - Oh. - What is it? - It's a red retriever. Oh. Oh, yeah. - [GRUNTS] Oh! - Nice dog. Good breed. Easy to train. You got something smaller? I got some cute Yorkies over here. - Oh. - I got this Japanese Chin. - Ah! - Uh, poodle. Corgi over here. Got a Pomeranian. [DOGS BARKING] (DOG) Look at all this great stuff. Somebody knew I was coming. Oh, yeah. [WHIMPERS] Hey, look at this. [DOG WHIMPERS] What do we have here? Look at this little guy. Bet it's worth a couple bucks. Yeah, it was a knockout in the second round. I lost everything. Hang tight, guy. - Now, you're buying this time. - [DOORS CLOSE] - Not today, buddy. - [CHUCKLING] (DOG) I thought about my life. I still had so many questions. But I kept coming back to the same one... How do I get a drink of water? [WOMAN LAUGHING] Do you want to get an ice cream? - Sure. - [DOG WHIMPERING LOUDLY] What flavor? Mom, I hear something in there. Hey, honey. Ethan! Hey, Mom, come here. [PANTING] [WOMAN GASPS] My God. It looks so thirsty. (ETHAN) It's too hot in there. (MOM) I think we need to get him out. (ETHAN) I can't open the door. (MOM) Wait, it's locked. (ETHAN) Please, Mom. (MOM) Okay, stand back. [SIGHS] - You poor thing. - [WEAK WHIMPERING] You poor, poor thing.

I think this little guy is gonna make it. - (ETHAN) Can we keep him, Mom? - I don't know. I think your father might not... [CHUCKLING] I decided right then and there I am definitely keeping this boy. [LAUGHING] [BARKING] Yeah! Dad, can we keep him? - [TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] - Well, who's gonna feed him? - I will. - Who's gonna clean him? I'll do everything, Dad. - You think you're ready to do it? - Yeah. - Oh, I don't know, son. - He's a good boy. - He's a good boy. - [SIGHS] [DOG BARKS, ETHAN CHUCKLES] (ETHAN) Come on, please. He's a retriever, Dad. He'll fetch your slippers. And the paper when it rains. Name something you want fetched. He can do it. Look. Hey, come here! - [DOG BARKING] - What are you doing? So, Ethan and I discussed that the dog - would be his responsibility. - Come here! Yeah. Good boy. (ETHAN) Please, Dad? (MOM) Come on. He needs a pal. - [DOG WHIMPERS] - (DAD) All right, this thing that you two are doing, it's dirty pool,... okay? Take him away. I want to talk to your mother alone. (ETHAN) Okay. (DAD) We'll keep it till tomorrow... (ETHAN) You nervous, boy? Don't be. It'll be okay. Yeah. (MOM) We don't have much choice. (DAD) They make a mess. - You gotta clean 'em. - Oh, come on. - He's gonna be bored with it. - Oh, come on, Jim. (DAD) You know it. You know how he is. If he says no, we can run off and go find another family. [DOOR OPENS] Ethan? Yeah? You have a dog. - Yes! Oh, my gosh, yes! - [BARKING] Come on, boy. Dad! - Whoo! Yes! - All right. Oh, my gosh, thank you! Come on! Come on! (MOM) Bailey. B-A-I-L-E-Y, I-I would think. (ETHAN) And I'm Ethan. I'm the owner. Do you think he knows how to spell my name? I would think so, honey. (ETHAN) Here you go. Good boy. Here you go. Ready? - Come on, Bailey. - [BARKS] Bailey, sit. Sit. Roll over. Roll over. [BARKING] [BAILEY WHINING] Get that out of your mouth! Get that out of your mouth. Okay. Come here. Shake your paw. Shake your paw. Come on. Yeah, good boy! Turn around. Turn around. - Come on. - (DOG) What's he saying? - It's too many words. - (ETHAN) Come on. Okay. - I'm gonna do this now. - (ETHAN) Come here. Good job. Good job. But one word got said more than any other. Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey. After a while, I came to understand the words that mattered. I had a boy, and his name was Ethan. I got a name. My name was Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey. Oh, gee, honey, I wish I'd have known that you and Wes were... I learned my place in the pack. Mom liked me. - (DAD) Yes... - Dad liked me. - Yes. Yes, no, I understand. - A lot. Oh, excuse me. Hold on. Come on. Get down a bit. I was sad for the cat. Obviously, he wanted to be a dog. [CAT HISSES, YOWLS] Wasn't my fault he couldn't be a dog. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Ethan, it's time to go to bed. Time to turn out the light, okay? Okay. [DOOR CLOSES] Okay, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Okay. - [BAILEY BARKS] "Don't! Don't do it, Cap. "Let him have it, Bucky. "We'll pound some sense into this character. "Pow! Stomp! "It's coming right at us. Jump for your lives!" Ethan always came up with such great games. - "Boom!" - Making noise under a blanket, genius. - "Zap!" - Every night as I fell asleep, I thought about how happy I was that I had an Ethan. And that I wasn't a cat. [YAPPING] Bailey, get in the car. (ETHAN) Come on, boy.

Here, take him. Just take him. And you say, "I am the boss!" You gotta show him who's boss. [JIM SIGHS] All right, everything goes back where it belongs. I want this place spick-and-span. Do you understand? Well, do you understand? Do you understand?! - Yes, sir. - Thank you. I want everything just the way I like it. Spick-and-span. Why? Because I'm the boss. That's why.

No! Hey! (DOG) Ethan was good to me. - Boy! No! - He always shared his food. Do you have it in your mouth? Did you swallow it? - Wasn't my favorite treat. - Come on, show me. - And he wanted it back. - Come on, come on. - Why? - [DOORBELL RINGS] [GASPS] - (WOMAN) We made it. - Hello! Ellen. Come in. Welcome. - Yes. - I am glad we were finally able to make it out here, because I have been wanting to, uh, visit the field office for a while now. Oh, yes, and it's... it's so nice and... quiet out here in the suburbs. - It sure is. Yeah. - Yes. Well, we're happy to have you. Um, so I-I've been meaning to say we... uh, we're real impressed with your numbers this past year, Jim. Real impressed. You know, I'm glad you brought that up. Uh, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that. You know, I-I was thinking, with the numbers so high, maybe it's time I get off the road and take an office position. Well, we... we really need you on the road. That's the backbone of the whole operation really. I'll be honest, Jim. You are one of our best traveling salesmen. I mean, I would be crazy to take you out of the field. (BOSS) Um, are you still collecting coins? (JIM) Oh, sure. (BOSS) What... what's your showpiece? Nineteen Saint-Gaudens golden eagle. (ELLEN) Oh! Well, Herman, I don't know anything about coins, but I know that that is special. - That is special. - That is a treasure. Yeah, I have never seen one up close before. - (ELIZABETH) It's quite a coin. - (JIM) Yeah, it's a beauty. I'll show you. I'll go get it. Well, maybe after dinner. [CHUCKLES] (JIM) Let me go get it later. [chuckles] May I please be excused? Huh? May I please be excused? Need to take Bailey out for a walk. Sure, honey. (ETHAN) Go on, do it. Please, Bailey. Please, Bailey, do it. Come on. (DOG) What does he want from me? Come on. Come on. I really wish I knew what he was saying. Go! Go! Come on! What's your problem? Come on! [SIGHS] I don't know why he was so upset, but it made me anxious. And when I'm anxious, things kind of move super fast. [BARKS] [GASPS] This was a first. I'd never seen him so happy to clean up after me. Yes! Found it! [CHUCKLES] It's important it shouldn't be too sweet. - No, it's nice. Mmm. - See this? - Oh. - Now, this... - Mm-hmm. - that's something - for your eyes to feast on. - No! What? There's a rat. - What? -What? - Right there! - Where? No, I don't like rats. - Where? - Where is it? -It's okay. - Under the table. - (DOG) I love rats. - Yeah, go get it, Bailey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - [ELLEN SCREAMS] - (ELIZABETH) I don't see anything. - (JIM) Where? - It's running over there. - (JIM) Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! - Get that dog! Get the dog. - [GASPS] - Get the dog. Get the... - Bailey! - I don't see anything. - [GASPS] - Come here. - It's right there. - Maybe you saw Smokey. - Definitely not Smokey. - (JIM) No, it wasn't Smokey. I really don't like rats. I don't like rats. It's more scared of you than you are of him. - Oh, oh! - Come here. Come here, Bailey. - Come here! Come here. - Can you grab him? Grab him. - Jim. - Bailey! Bailey, come here! - [ELLEN GASPS] - (JIM) Come here! (ELIZABETH) Wait. Please, Bailey. - Can you grab him, Jim? - (HERMAN) I don't see anything. - (JIM) Bailey! - [Ellen gasping] Bailey, come here. I think it's gone now. (ELLEN) Oh, I don't like rats! Whoa! [GASPS] (JIM) Bailey! What was that? [GROANS] - [BARKS] - (ELLEN) Herman! (JIM) Bailey, come here! Come here! Come on! (ELIZABETH) You got him, Jim? You got him? [GRUNTS] [ELLEN GASPING] - [ELLEN SCREAMS] - (JIM) Whoa! Any chances I had of a promotion, forget it. Dad! Dad, stop! - It's not his fault. It's... - You made us look like fools! (DOG) Dad always talked so loud when he smelled this way. (ETHAN) Don't punish him! My fault! (ELIZABETH) Jim, why don't we take a moment before you... (JIM) No, from now on, he stays out here. (ETHAN) He didn't do anything! I do not want to see him. I do not want to see him in the house. But it's cold outside. (JIM) Well, he's got fur for that. (ELIZABETH) We should at least set out a blanket. (JIM) It's a dog! (DOG) Ethan? Hey, boy. Good? I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. Even though I couldn't see him, I knew Ethan was very sad that night. [SNIFFING] [STEPS APPROACHING, COLLAR JINGLING] [GASPS] Hey, boy. [BAILEY WHIMPERING] Hey. It's cold out there, isn't it? (DOG) I knew he needed me. And I needed him, too.

(ETHAN) Yeah, exactly. 'Cause every time we run that play... (DOG) Everybody wanted to walk next to the alpha male. (ETHAN) Yeah, that's what I mean. Almost everybody. (ETHAN) 'Cause he's right there every single time. Yep. Ethan, why do you always have this dog with you? Hmm? What? It's like a girlfriend replacement or something? - [CHUCKLES] Huh? - Yeah, good one, Todd. Give a little kiss? Huh? I'm just asking. Excuse me. [LAUGHTER] (ETHAN) Oh, I'm sorry, Todd. Did my, uh, girlfriend replacement just trip you? Very funny. - Relax, man. I'm kidding. - The dog's laughing at you. - Dogs don't laugh, you moron. - Bailey, come here. [DOG LAUGHING] That's funny. - (ELIZABETH) Got everything? - Yeah. When Lou dropped that pass at the start, - I thought we were done, man. - [LAUGHING] I know! (ETHAN) Here. [ETHAN AND ELIZABETH LAUGHING] (ETHAN) Bailey, come here. Hey, Dad. - (ELIZABETH) You hungry? - (ETHAN) I'm starving. - I got a casserole in the oven. - Yeah?

(TODD) It's pretty obvious. - Can we go? - Yeah, we're going soon. Oh, oh, and his girlfriend's fighting his battles, too. If Michigan State knew the real Ethan... - [TODD GRUNTS] - (HANNAH) Whoa!

(FRAN) It's so good to have you here. (DOG) Ethan never wanted to play anymore. Oh, Bailey. I'm so sorry. Even though he carried a great new stick everywhere he went. [BARKING] (ETHAN) Bailey, come on. Hey! (GRANDPA) Come here, Bailey. - No, no, no, no, no, Bailey. - Bailey. (GRANDPA) Come on. Come on. I couldn't make him play with me. All he wanted to do was sleep. I had a lot of free time now, so I made a new friend. It was like a small horse. Or a giant dog. [SNIFFING] With its own special smell that was so wonderful and disgusting. Oh, I wished I could roll in it. - [BARKING] - [BRAYING] Oh, we had fun. - Until we didn't. - [BRAYING] At least Hannah still came around. Hey! - Hey. - [LAUGHING] Hi, Bailey. Hi. Hi. I missed you, too. Good boy. Good boy. Ah, you're such a good boy. Come on. Come on! - Hey. - Hey. You, um... do you want to go to the pond? I made some sandwiches. Yeah. I mean... Yeah, if you want. I just... I thought it'd be nice if we could get out of the house, get you out. [SIGHS] What? Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to... you don't have to do this. You don't have to help me. I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for us. I want... No, you're doing this for me. You leave for college in three weeks. But I'll be back all the time. Uh-huh, and I'll be here. With that. You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself. You can't do this for me, Hannah. I'd do anything for you. I don't think we should be with each other anymore, Hannah. Whoa. We shouldn't be with each other anymore. It's not gonna work. I'm sorry. Why are you doing this? [WHIMPERS SOFTLY] [CHUCKLING] Bailey. Good boy. Yeah. You want your ball? [SNIFFLES] Okay, here's your ball. Go on. [BAILEY BARKS] [HANNAH CHUCKLES] [CRYING] Bye, Bailey. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Wait. Wait, no. No, stay. I really missed Hannah. Ethan missed her, too. I could tell. Ethan, I made you a sandwich. I'm gonna put it in the backseat, okay? - All right, Fran. - Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey. Good boy. You're gonna miss me, huh? I'm gonna miss you, too. (GRANDPA) Don't look so glum, women. It-it's a good agricultural school. He's gonna learn everything he needs to know about running this farm. - Mm-hmm. - Yes, absolutely. Yes. (ETHAN) All right, go on. Come on. Better grab him. He's not gonna understand. Come here. - Good boy. Good boy. - Have you got the dog? Let's come here. - Stay, Bailey, stay. - (GRANDPA) Come on, boy. [ENGINE STARTS] (GRANDPA) Great day, huh? (FRAN) He's so grown-up. What's he doing? - [BAILEY YELPS] - Oh! (GRANDPA) Oh, my goodness. Good boy, Bailey. You keep that for me, okay, Bailey? - (FRAN) Caught it. - (GRANDPA) Yeah. (FRAN) Bye, Ethan. (GRANDPA) Drive safe. See you, Ethan! [WHINES SOFTLY] - [BAILEY GROANS] - (ELIZABETH) No, Bailey. - Stay. - (GRANDPA) You got him, honey? (DOG) Stay? We're playing fetch. - Bailey! - [BARKS] It's been so long since we've played. [GOATS BLEATING] Bailey. [DOG PANTING] I like this new version of fetch. You're crazy, you know that, boss dog? Maybe not... drive so far next time. Take care of things around here for me, okay, boy? I'll be back soon. Promise. [BAILEY PANTING] [ETHAN SIGHS] Come on. Go on. Go home. [WHIMPERS] Humans are complicated. They do things dogs can't understand. Like leave. Ethan and I were meant to be together. But if there was no Ethan, what was the point of my being here? Maybe the point was not to look for a point. (GRANDPA) Okay, hold on. Hold on. [BAILEY PANTING] Okay. I'll be right back, Bailey. (DOG) Everything moved at a slower pace now. Which was okay, because I never felt like running anymore. I was tired all the time. I didn't feel like playing anymore. Not even with horse-dog. [BIRD CAWING] Hey, Bailey. [WHEEZING QUIETLY] Are you okay, boy? [BAILEY WHIMPERS WEAKLY] Bill? - Careful. Keep a... - Okay. (MAN) Okay, let's see what we have here. (FRAN) His eyes just didn't look right. They just, uh... they were... they were kind of rheumy. And he... and he was panting, he was, uh... his breathing was labored. He's-he's also got this little lump in his, uh... Oh, yeah. Has he been drinking - a lot of water and peeing? - No. Lethargic, so he... he doesn't want to go for walks anymore? I had to carry him into the car. What can we do for him, Doctor? What do you think? Well, we-we... we could do testing, but I'm afraid that it would probably be the same results. His... his kidneys are shutting down. (FRAN) Can we just... (DOG) Everyone was so sad, but I was too tired to cheer them up. Dr. Joyce, can I, uh... can I use your phone? Yes. Oh, absolutely. Doctor, Doctor, uh, if this was a person... If this was a person... You're the veterinarian... If this was a person, would you say that... - [CONVERSATION FADES] - [ROTARY TELEPHONE DIALING] (BILL) Uh, hello. Yeah, uh, I'm looking for Ethan. It's his grandpa, Bill. Ethan, it's Grandpa. Ethan. Are you here? I can't smell you. Where are you? [LIGHT BUZZING] (ETHAN) Hey, Bailey. [SNIFFING] (DOG) There he was. I could tell he was still sad. I didn't want him to be sad. Doodle dog. - Boss dog, huh? - [WEAK BREATHING] I knew I was here to love Ethan and make him happy. (ETHAN) Oh, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey. I didn't want to leave him like this. Good boy. Good boy, Bailey. (VETERINARIAN) Don't worry. He'll just feel a little... A little prick in his neck, and then the pain will go away. (DOG) And then it happened again. The mother, the milk, the tongue, the warmth. I was back. But why? Where was Ethan? Other things were missing, too. I didn't have a... What? I'm a girl? Come on, come on! Good girl, good girl. My man was very serious. Look. - Over. Over. Good girl! - We worked hard. Even when we played, he made it feel like work. Easy, easy. Down, down. - Find Wally.

My job is to seek, find... - and show. - [ELLIE BARKING] Good job. Good job. [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] But even when I did a good job, my man was still sad. [TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] He was lonely. I could smell someone else used to live here, but their scent was faint. They hadn't been around in a long time. That's when I realized being alone might be the worst thing that could happen to you. [THUNDER RUMBLING] I knew how it felt to miss someone. Did he miss someone, too? [ELLIE PANTING] [WHINING] Stop that. Hey. What? Dog bed... now. [CARLOS SIGHS] Ellie... Dog bed... now. Why did I listen to him? I didn't want to go. And I could tell he didn't want me to go, either. Oh, gosh. - [CARLOS GROANS] - [ELLIE WHIMPERS] Would you give me a break?

You're gonna be okay. [ELLIE WHIMPERS] You're gonna be okay. You're a good dog. I could tell from Carlos's voice I'd done a good job. [SOBBING] You're a good dog. I need to rest. Can I just sleep in your bed? [CARLOS CONTINUES SOBBING] That was a different life. Not so much fun, really. But I did good work. Here we go. Now I'm tiny and all ears. (WOMAN) Aw! Hi, you.

You read my mind. I think this is it, Tino. I think it's just gonna be you and me. I-I don't know. It's fine, right? Because I love you and you love me, and... love is all that matters.

For some reason, Al always came, too. It wasn't long before... we slept together. I'm really starting to get it now. If there's a point, Roxy is the point. Wait. What's going on? Um, Maya?

(MAYA) You gotta relax, honey. She's breathing, okay? (AL) Uh, maybe we should wake her up just to be sure. I didn't understand why they got a baby. It took all their attention. Good thing Roxy and I already had everything we needed. - [ROXY GRUMBLING] - Each other. (MAYA) Hey, baby. (DOG) Then they went and got more babies. Seemed like a mistake to me. Soon, I had to live my life on the run. [GASPS] Found him! [WHIMPERS] There was no escape. I let them do what they wanted to me. I'd do anything so that Roxy could be safe. That was my mission, to protect her at all times. [KIDS SCREAMING PLAYFULLY] I guess, if I was really honest, I liked all the attention. [BARKS] [KIDS LAUGHING, SQUEALING] Boo! [WHIMPERS] As Roxy and I got older, our connection grew stronger. [ROXY BARKING] And she never lost the spark that drew me to her in the first place. One day, Roxy went to the vet. And she never came back. - (BOY) Look at me! Look at me! - (GIRL) Oh! Everyone was good to me. But as the years went by, I missed Roxy. It just wasn't the same without her. Hey, Tino. Hey, Tino.

[HORN HONKS] [BIRDS TWITTERING] - Had I been here before? - [SNIFFING] I was so happy to leave the town behind. My nose was full of fresh new smells. And then there are the smells you never forget. [SNIFFING] Train. Moss. Trees. Horse. Garbage. It was horse-dog! [BARKING] Could it be the same? - [SNORTS] - Ah, it was the same. Could it mean Ethan was here, too? (MAN) That ought to cover us to the end of the month. Ethan? That can't be him. (MAN) Tell Fred that I will be in town... Is that him? tomorrow to settle up, okay? (MAN 2) Will do. It is him! It's him! Yes! Yes, it's him! Hey! Hey! Hey! [GRUNTS] It's me! - Boss dog! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey. - [LAUGHING] - Doodle dog! - Hey! Where'd you come from? After all these lives, I'd actually found him. I found Ethan. I'm gonna make a bet you're hungry. Here you go. [COWS MOOING] Wow. You must be. Nobody likes my cooking. - Don't look at me like that. - [WHINING] You can't stay here. You gotta go home. You belong to somebody. Home. Yes. Yes, I'm home. [BARKS] Go home, dog. Go home. You're a stubborn one, aren't you? [MAN OVER RADIO] Then, Tuesday night, we got three tenths of an inch of rain. [DOGS BARKING] Be sure he gets a good home. He's a good dog. (WOMAN) Sure. No. No, don't leave me here. This is a white-coat place. I belong with you. So long, dog. [BARKING] [WATER RUNNING, DISHES CLATTERING] [DOGS BARKING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [WHINES] You want to get out of here? [BARKS] [LAUGHING] Do you want to go? Come on, let's go. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] (DOG) I was back in the front seat. Okay, buddy. Guess it's gonna be you and me. And the donkey. What's a donkey? (ETHAN) Now, when was the last time you got a bath? That's a good boy. Yeah. There you go. All right. Just step out. Out. Let's go! There you go. You're getting a new collar. Yeah! Doesn't look like he's missed too many meals. - He's in good shape. - Yeah, he's a good boy. Aren't you, huh? But Ethan still seemed sad. Maybe it was because he slept alone. I wanted to help him, but I didn't know how. Wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Okay, Bailey, let's do this. Hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. - This is the place. - [DOGS BARKING] I'm looking for... [SNIFFING] (WOMAN) Come on, Carly. Come here, girl. - Come on, Carly. - Come on, Carly. (BOY) Come here, Carly. Can you get the gate for me? - Yes, Mommy. - Thank you. (BOY) Good girl. Oh, sorry. Rach. (RACHEL) Oh, hey. Look, Will. - Grandma's here. - (WILL) Hi, Grandma. There's that smell again. - How are you feeling? - I'm pretty good. This is a surprise. It's stronger now. I thought I'd bring you some groceries. - It's Hannah! - Aw. Hmm, thanks. You're still here? Oh, you look different. But you still smell like biscuits. - [SNIFFS, BARKS] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [CHUCKLES] (HANNAH) Who is this? It's the, uh, stray from the park. A stray? Really? - Well, hello there. - [SNIFFING, PANTING] What a good dog. Well, he's certainly not a stray, 'cause he's got a collar. Let's see. His name is Buddy. Let's see. He belongs to... [PANTING] - [BUDDY BARKS] - [ROOSTER CROWS] [GASPS] [FOOTFALLS ON STEPS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [SIGHS] [KNOCKING] Come on, Ethan. I can smell you in there. I don't want to leave you here. But I guess he's not home. [BARKING] [GROANS] [BARKING] [GASPS] Hi, Ethan. Hi, Hannah. - [BUDDY BARKS] - [HANNAH CHUCKLES] I brought your dog home. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] (ETHAN) Must have been tough on you, losing your husband after all those years. Yeah, it made me miss my daughter a lot. [SIGHS] And then, with the new baby coming, I thought Rachel and Miguel could really use the help. Yeah. How long you get to stay for? Uh, well, I'm... I'm not visiting, Ethan. I moved back about a month ago. - Y-You did? - [HANNAH CHUCKLES] Welcome home. Thanks. [GROANS QUIETLY] Well, this place is still the same. [ETHAN CHUCKLING] Yeah. (DOG) Oh, come on. So, what about you? You... you never met anyone or... Never found the right fit. Mm-hmm. I'm really stubborn. I know that. [CHUCKLES] When you put your mind to something, that was that. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. That's good for getting things done. It's not so good for relationships. - Uh... - Mmm. Okay, well... Okay, here we go. They're gonna lick faces. Well, look, this was really nice. I gotta go. Thank you, Ethan. (DOG) Wait, what? Oh, come on! (ETHAN) Hey, thanks for bringing back my dog. You're welcome. Bye. Hey, Hannah. I, uh... I owe you an apology. For what happened to us. Back then. Well, don't worry. It was a long, long time ago. No. I pushed you away. And I was... I was really mad at the world. And I just want you to know that not a day goes by that I don't kick myself for doing that. There's that sweaty smell. You think, uh, it'd be crazy if... we did something together? Are you asking me out on a date? Well, I just think that I'd be an all-time fool if I just watched you drive away. (DOG) Enough talking. Use your nose. Then don't. [BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY] Okay, now you're getting it. - Yes! Yes! - [BARKING] [CHICKENS CLUCKING] [BUDDY CONTINUES BARKING] Get out of here. Give 'em some space. [QUIET CHATTER, LAUGHTER] Few right there, that's why... Hi, you little cutie pie. Ew. My water has mint in it. You have a good time? (DOG) Once they started licking faces, no one could stop them. Ethan finally had what he needed. He was happy. I was happy, too. - Excuse me, everybody. - [GLASS CLINKING] I-I would like to thank you all for coming here today. - It means a lot to Hannah and I. - Cheers. - Hear, hear. I've always wanted a big family. All in one day, I've got one. You didn't tell me how big it was. [LAUGHTER] I just would like to say how grateful I am, that my beautiful girl walked back into my life. - (OTHERS) Aw. - Thank you. Life's a mystery. - (OTHERS) Cheers. - [applause, cheering] There was one thing I still wanted. I wanted him to know it was me. (HANNAH) We had so much fun last night. That I was Bailey. (HANNAH) What a great night. Stop. You were amazing. Yeah. You, too. - [BARKS QUIETLY] - [ETHAN LAUGHS] - Wait, didn't Bailey used to do that? - Yeah. It's a dog thing. [HANNAH CHUCKLES] Bailey. I'm Bailey. There's gotta be a way. Hmm. Wait. [SNIFFING] That's familiar. [SNIFFING] I smelled... me. What do you got there? Where did you find that? [SNIFFING] Hey. You want to play? [BARKS] Get ready. You have to really go after this one. Go get it. Good boy! Come on, bring it here. Good one. All right. You go play, all right? Gotta get back. [CHUCKLES] [BARKING] What? What do you want? [CHUCKLES] This is nuts. [BARKING] All right, Buddy. You want to go for the showstopper? [CONTINUES BARKING] You want to try it? You want to get it? Ready? I am ready. Okay. Go! Where did you learn how to do that, Buddy? [SIGHS] You are really starting to freak me out, boss dog. - [BARKS] - Yes, Ethan, that's right. I'm your boss dog. I'm Bailey. Say it. [BUDDY BARKING] Boss dog? [CONTINUES BARKING] [WHIMPERS] Are you the boss dog? [BARKING] No. Yes. It's me, Ethan. It's me. Bailey? [BARKING] Bailey. [WHIMPERING] [LAUGHING] Boss dog. Bailey, Bailey, Bailey. Bailey, Bailey. Aw. Mmm, yeah. - [LAUGHING] - [BARKS] So, in all my lives as a dog, here's what I've learned. Have fun, obviously. Whenever possible, find someone to save, and save them. Lick the ones you love. Don't get all sad-faced about what happened and scrunchy-faced about what could. - Just be here now. - Go! - [BARKS] - Okay, go get it. - Be here now. - That's it.
