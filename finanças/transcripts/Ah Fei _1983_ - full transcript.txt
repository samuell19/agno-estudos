["You Ma Cai Zi"] "Rapeseed" (aka "Ah Fei") [children playing - Taiwanese dialect] Brother, I am bored of this. Let's play "Say Say Say". Say Say Say. One, two, three. Four, five, six. Seven, eight, hands on waist. Nine, ten, call on phone. Hello, is Ah-Shong at home? Speaking. Hello, is Ah-Whay at home? Speaking. Mix it around. Scissors, paper, stone. - This one? - No. - This one? - Correct. Say, say, say. One, two, three. Four, five, six. Seven, eight, hands on waist. Nine, ten, call on phone. - Hello, is Ah-Shong at home? - Here. Speaking. - Hello, is Ah-Wen at home? - Here. Speaking. Mix it around. Scissors, paper, stone. Every day back so late. Where on earth have you been? Eh, what are you doing? Give it me. Give it me. You only know how to spend money. Earn your own money if you want to spend it. Shame on you! Give me some money. No man should behave like you. Give it to me. - Shut up. Give me money. - No. This is my dowry. I have only such a little dowry. You can't take it. You can't take it. This is my dowry. Shame on you. You can't take it. My mother gave this to me. My mother gave this to me. You can't take it. Mama. Mama, where are you going? Mama, let's go home. Shou-Ching, you're having some difficulty, aren't you? I am going back to my mother's family. Please help me take care of the children for a few days. All right. Ah-Shong, let's go in. Ah-Whay. Ah-Whay! Ah-Whay, go on, let's go in. Come on. Shou-Ching is really to be pitied. She grew up in a high class family. How could she marry such a husband? He doesn't care about his own home. Husband, or no husband, wouldn't it be the same for her? But it's these two children who are paying the highest price. Shou-Ching. Bring the two children back first. I have to talk to Shee-Chean. Shee-Chean, I have brought Shou-Ching back. It's your fate to be together. When Shou-Ching was a little child her mother died. Perhaps I spoiled her too much. Since you are a couple now, you must tolerate each other. Mother, is father coming back? Father will be back soon. Just wait a bit longer. Mother, I'm really hungry. Doctor, hello. Want a haircut? Doctor, your daughter Shou-Ching ... I haven't seen her for a long time. She hasn't been back all this time? Your grandson must be grown up already. How has your son-in-law Shee-Chean been lately? Doctor. Doctor? Doctor?! Father. Food's almost ready. I won't be eating at home tonight. I've got to go out. - Where is Ah-Shong? - Playing outside. Ah-Whay, tell Ah-Shong to come back in. Okay. Brother, father wants you to come back. Brother, father wants you to come back. Father. Ah-Shong, Daddy is going to take you out. Come on. Where are you going? When are you coming back? [drunken singing] Coming inside without taking your shoes off again? Come and wash your face. Ah-Whay, take your brother's and father's shoes away. Your father wastes too much. Why did he buy this sword? It wasn't father who bought it. If not father, then who bought it? Hm? Tell me - who bought it? Father told me not to say. Tell your mother. Your father won't scold you. A woman bought it. A woman? What woman? Hurry up. Otherwise I won't wait for you. Ah-Shong, bring me that sword you had yesterday. Your father wastes too much. Why did you buy this sword? Ah-Shong. Come over here. Was it your father who bought this sword? It wasn't father who bought it. If father didn't buy it, then who did? Speak! Father told me not to tell anybody. Tel your mother. Your father won't blame you. A woman bought it. What woman? What woman bought it? Tell me! Which woman was it? Which woman, for goodness sake?! Come on, eat something. Yes. Eat. Mama will give you something to eat. Oh? Good boy. Mama opened it. Eat. No, don't take such a big bite. Don't choke yourself. Dad, did you buy "Oriental Youth"? Your salary was already paid a while ago this month. There should be 1000 dollars. But there's only 220 left. What the hell have you been up to? What's this? What do you mean by this? Did you cut it up? That was a good suit. How could you cut it like that? Are you crazy? Your family is rich, right? You're a rich woman, right? ["My mother."] Lee Wen-Whay, why have you drawn a hand? Ah-Whay, we women one day will run the family. You need to know how to save money. Mama will teach you. For example, if you buy vegetables in the morning, it's expensive. We don't buy food then. We can wait till afternoon. When they close the shop, we go to buy. If you are lucky in the future, you will marry a good man. But if not, you will have to take care of yourself. Girls are better than boys. Ah-Whay helps mother with the housework. Your brother stays out day and night. You don't know how tough it is for mama. Ah-Whay, do you want a sister? Mama, are you really going to have another baby? Mm. Anybody at home? Anybody at home? What is it? - Is this your child? - Yes. He stole my bananas. I'm sorry. You see, the bananas are still green. We can't eat these. He led a group of children stealing bananas from my farm. How much did he take? I'll pay you. Money is not the point. Your son needs a lesson! Yes. Teach your son properly. He shouldn't do that. Sorry. Sorry. Ah-Shong, come here. What are you playing at? Those bananas aren't ripe. Even if you pick them, you can't eat them. It wasn't just me. How dare you defend yourself after doing things like that! You won't dare to steal again! You won't dare to steal again! You must confess. Stand still. Don't block me with your hands. If you beat me, I'll have father beat you. Ah ...? What are you saying? You dare ask your father to beat me? What kind of son are you? I've loved you in vain. I'm so angry! I'm so angry! Today I'm going to give you a hard lesson. Come! You're still young. I can't believe it! I don't believe I can't teach you well. I don't believe I can't teach you well. Ah-Shong! Ah-Shong! Ah-Shong. Ah-Shong. Ma. Ah-Whay. Ma? Bring a tissue. Ma, what's wrong? Mama... Ah-Whay The baby in Mama's belly needs help Go and call Ah-Fu. Get the doctor. Mama, you can't die! I'll be back soon. I'll be back really soon. Ah-Fu... open the door. Ah-Fu, open the door, quick! Ah-Fu, open the door. Ah-Whay, what's the matter? My mother is bleeding a lot. Quick, get the doctor. Hurry! Ma, ma... the doctor is here! - Ma. - Ah-Whay, turn on the light. (boy playing outside) Ma. Mama is sleeping now. Try to keep quiet. Ah-Whay, Are you any better? Here... This is for you. Take it. Father bought it for you. Anyway, rest well, okay? Ah-Whay, bring some wood. The Fortune Cakes haven't risen well. I just know ... our luck this year will also not be good. Let's talk about this outside. Bit late to worry about that. We'll talk inside. Here, here... have another cigarette. Smoking?? You're thinking about smoking? Is your wife home or not? Tell her to come out. I can deal with this by myself. You want to solve this? Can you even solve this yourself? Your husband is an intellectual. How dare he do a thing like this? He had an affair with someone's wife. According to tradition, his heel should be cut off. Do you know that? Anyway, what's done is done. By seven o'clock tonight, bring 10,000 dollars to my home. Otherwise ... Don't forget to bring firecrackers too. Shou-Ching. this problem... we need to think carefully how to solve it. 10,000 dollars is not a small amount. You are a junior technician. How much money can you earn a month? Someone comes here demanding money... only you could do such a thing. Shame on you! There is almost no money left. This house is all there is. Do you plan to sell that?? Ah-Shong. Ah-Whay, Father and I are going out to pawn some things. If you're hungry, eat some rice cake in the kitchen. Just take it when you want. Don't go anywhere. We'll be back soon. Eat up! After the New Year's holiday, we'll move to Taipei. We can't stay here any longer. Will father come too? Ah-Whay, bring a bucket of water here. All right. Go and tell Ah-Shong and Ah-Shing to come back to wash and eat. When your father leaves work, tell him come back soon, not hang around somewhere else. All right. Really? Is it true? It's time to eat. What are you buying sugarcane for? Ah-Whay, go and wash Ah-Shing's feet. Mm. Here's this month's salary. It's all there, you don't need to check. Eh? And what about the overtime payment? So little! Didn't you work a couple of extra days? I bought two packs of cigarettes and repaid the noodle shop owners 40 dollars. There's no money left at all. Ah-Shong, how much needed for the tuition fee? 200 dollars. Ma, I have to pay an extra tuition fee. Ma ... I have to pay an extra tuition fee. Let's talk about it next month! But everyone in class has already paid. I'm the only one who hasn't... Go and ask your father. What are you thinking about? Private school tuition is very expensive. You must study hard! Dad, Mama told me to ask you for the extra tuition fee. Is it really necessary? The teacher said if we don't, we won't pass the Junior High School entrance exam. - How much? - 30 dollars. I only have 20 dollars. Just take ten, all right? But that's not enough! Tell the teacher to lower the price. We're not very well-off. - What score did you get last time? - Eighty-two. You dropped four points. One stroke. - What score did you get last time? - Seventy-five. You dropped ten points. Two strokes. Put your hand out. Put it higher. - How much did you get last time? - Eighty points. How have you dropped thirty points? Put out your hand. Let me see. - What score did you get last time? - Sixty. Why have you dropped twenty points? I... I help my father at work. There's no time to study. - Really? - Yes. Okay. Give me your hands. Cane twice. You moved! Put out your hands. Higher. The last one doesn't count. - How many points did you get last time? - Eighty-five points. Dropped ten points. Put your hands out. Two strokes. - How many points did you get last time? - Forty points. Not enough. Put out your hand. Teacher, this is for the extra classes. My father only has 10 dollars. That's OK. Never mind. Lee Wen-Whay, you have talent in painting. Keep trying! Thank you, teacher. Ma. Ma, I came Second place in the painting contest. This is the prize. What's the use of painting? You're the same as your father. He only paints all day long. He doesn't care about things at home. Ah-Whay, for women, marrying the right man is the most critical thing. Marry well, and everything will be okay. Marry badly, and you'll be like your mother... hard labour every day of your life! Ah-Shong? Why so quiet? Ah-Shong. Ah-Shong. - He must be asleep again. - Ah-Whay, check if your brother is studying. All right. Brother, wake up. Brother! Mother says you have to study. Brother! Ah-Whay will finish Elementary School. I think it's needless for her to attend Junior High School. - Does your print-house need new staff? - No. Then send her to the factory to work. She can make some money and help support the family. Don't be silly. What work could such a young girl do? You mean she continues to attend Junior High School? Yes. Let's be clear. If you want her to keep studying, you'll have to find a way to pay her tuition. I can't afford it! We don't have money! [list of names] [list of names] [list of names] Ah-Whay. Ah-Whay. Have you heard any good news yet? I think you cannot pass the entrance exam. Even if you do, your father won't be able to pay for it. Ah-Whay passed the exam. Ah-Whay. Ah-Whay. Ah-Whay. No need to listen any more. The notice has been posted. Ah-Whay already passed the exam. City Junior High School. It's her first choice. Every colleague congratulated me. Ah-Whay is terrific. The same as her father. I knew you would get in. Are you going out again? Fooling around all day long. Why don't you study more during the holiday? From now on, you're not allowed to go out. Study hard at home. "The pig hasn't grown fat, but instead the dog has." Are you all right? The girl enrolled successfully, but you are not happy? It's lucky that she was accepted by a public school. What would we do if she gets into a private school? Come with me. Let's pray. You are a Junior High School student now. Are you happy? This morning when we were registering, I found the classmate standing behind us only got 169 points, and almost had to drop to his second choice. So my Ah-Whay really is excellent! Let's celebrate, okay? What shall we eat? I don't mind. You must have exactly what you want. Let's think... Beef noodle, boiled dumpling, or fried oyster. Look. Do it like this. Father, do you really have the money to pay for this?? Yes. Count it into the registration fee Don't tell your mother! This is for you. Use it as you wish. Uh-uh. It's okay. It's my overtime pay. Why are you so busy early in the morning? It's Sunday today. Men get Sundays off. Women have no such luck. - Go and buy some bean milk. - Okay. Where's the money? Tell him I'll pay him later. Ah-Whay, what are you learning there? English! Okay, father will teach you. This... is... a... book. This... is... a... book. Follow after me. This is a book. Still no bean milk. The child is studying. Why are you bothering her? Okay, I'm going now. Dad, how do you say "milk"? Milk? "Milk." "Milk"? "Milk." "Milk". The money in the box has disappeared. That's strange. I definitely put it in the box. How did it disappear? - Ah-Shong, did you take it? - No. - Ah-Whay, did you take it? - No. It's not me! Why should I take your money? - I have my own personal money! - Your own personal money? You dare to hide money from me? Come on, let's see where this secret money is. Where is it? It's been so long. I've forgotten. Ah-Whay, come and help me look for it. - Any more? - No. I don't believe you, Let's look upstairs. Where have you hidden the money? Tell me. I've told you, there isn't any. You have been hiding this in different places. How much have you kept? It's all here. You've found it all. If I find any more, you'll be in trouble. Okay okay okay, go and look. If you find anything, you can keep it. If not, it's still mine! What are you saying? So you don't care about this? If you don’t go and ask, who will? - Where are you going? - Overtime work. Overtime? There's always overtime work when you need to do something. How much overtime payment have you ever actually brought home? Overtime indeed! I give you all my money. How do I know what you do with it? You know how much you earn? Do you think the family can survive on that? Think about it. So many people in the house. Adults and children. Food. Clothes. Water. Electricity. Also, school fees. And extra tuition fees. You said it yourself, Chen-Shen's family was doing well. But now? The investment has gone bust. What are you going to do? It was your own stupidity. You wanted to invest in this group. I did that because of this family. I'm about to give birth to a baby. Is it wrong to prepare for our future? I've saved money at home, and just wanted to invest a little. Who knew they would go bust? - I need to go to work. - You... Extra work! Men are all the same. When they meet trouble, they just turn around. The family isn't my sole responsibility. But everything depends on me. It's not fair on women. Just think, the baby will come soon. There's no money. I don't know what to do. Why do I have such a husband? He has no sense of responsibility. Ma, you need money. Let me give this to you. That's your savings, to prepare for your high school and university study. I can't take it. Ma, it's okay. Just take it. It's your savings. You should break it open. Ah-Whay, father has received your letter. You said you want to find a teaching job at night. Father cannot agree with this. This sounds like your mother's idea. Speaking frankly, Dad sends money home each month. There should be some left, after the home expenses. Your mother's ideas... Father finds it more and more difficult to understand her. Father still hopes you concentrate on your studies. First, pass the College entrance exam. Then we'll talk. Father will back you up. So, Ah-Shong enlisted for one year? How is life in the army? I hope you can tell me something about that in your next letter. Father works in the Philippines. Sometimes I am homesick, and almost three years have passed in no time at all. Though the pay is good abroad, I always feel lonely and strange as an outsider. From time to time, I think of everything back at home. Oh. Yes. How is Ah-Shing, and Ah-Ping? They must be taller now. I miss them. Remember me to your mother, and write to me when you have the time. - With much love from me... - Ah-Whay! - Father. - It's almost seven o'clock. Eat up, it's time to study. Ma, I'm going now. Send 300 dollars to your brother. Tell him to use it wisely. All right. What are you looking at? Eat up! Ah-Whay, tell your brother to come back on holiday. Father has written him so many letters. Tell him to reply. All right. Sister, brother has come back. He's upstairs. Okay. Ma, I got the first prize in this month's test. Mm. Ma, please wash this military suit for me. - You're back. - Yes. Ma, I have to go out. You don't have much holiday. Can't you stay at home to eat? I've already arranged to meet a friend. I've just taken 300 dollars from your handbag. I sent you 300 dollars only last month. You've spent it all?! - Come back as soon as you can! - Mm. Ma. Ma, I'm going out for a little while, okay? You've already dressed up. What are you asking me for? Is it seemly for a girl to go out so late? Where are you going? It's late. You don't need to walk me further. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Sister, mother is waiting for you in your room. You had better get upstairs quickly! Get in here! Sit. Where have you been? Dating? Who is this man? It says: "Sender's address not supplied". Not even a name written. What is "The name is already known"? Tell me. Who is he? Speak! It doesn't matter if you don't say. I'll go to school tomorrow to ask your teacher. I'll ask him what kind of classroom he's been running, letting a student date like this. Just tell your mother. It won't be a big deal. Mother won't blame you. What's his name? Chen Leh-Way. What school does he attend? Shin-Ta Junior High School of the Teaching University. Ah-Shing... - Ah-Shing, go and get the scissors. - Yes. Now, come over here. Go downstairs. Go on, downstairs! Tomorrow I'll tell your school you'll need sick leave for a month. Father, I haven't written to you for a long time. Don't blame me. Do you still remember, I told you before about a student at Shin-Ta Junior High School of the Teaching University? He was forced to move to another school because Mother spoke to his teacher. I heard he left Taipei. I had no opportunity to say sorry to him. The College Entrance Exams are starting. I buried myself in books. Father, I didn't fail you. I finally got to my first choice of university. I am enjoying campus life. But I also feel that I have lost something. I am just like the common bombax flower by the window. It seems so lonely. Father, when are you coming back? I really miss you. I hope you can come back as soon as possible. Always love you, Ah-Whay. Yes? Assistant manager Li, you have a call on line 2. Haven't I said, I don't want to take any calls during meetings? It's your mother. All right. Hello... this is Ah-Whay. Ah-Whay! Don't forget, When you collect the clothes, check carefully whether the tailor loosened the waist for me. Collect the clothes? Ma, haven't we said we'll do that tomorrow? Originally, we were going to do it tomorrow. But the tailor just called. He said the clothes are ready. We can collect them now. I'm in a meeting now. Wait for me to finish work, and I'll do it then, okay? Okay. Oh, Ah-Whay, your brother came back from Kaohsiung. When you finish work, come back as early as possible. Who came back? Your brother. - From where? - From Kaohsiung! Oh, okay! Ah-Shong is coming back today? Mm. Ma, hurry up! I'm going back to Kaohsiung this afternoon. How can I borrow so much money in such a short time? Every time you come back, it's such a rush. You don't even have time to eat. Can you handle your business? I would've closed it already if I couldn't handle it. I am not an idiot. Take some advice. If you can't do it, then just let it go, and stop doing it. I also used to think it would be easy to make money. But I now know, it's not like that. Doing business is very tough. That is because you are useless. You think our son is as useless as you are. Ma, your clothes have been altered. I've already paid. - Hello, brother. - Mm. Ah-Whay, could you cash this cheque for your brother? It's Saturday today. Where can I cash this? Just do it on Monday. Ma, I have a lunch appointment with a customer. I won't eat at home. Ma, I'm asking... please help me. All right, all right. Come on, finish up. Just wait a minute. I'll think how to sort it out for you. You'll "think"? How long's that going to take? I really need the money this afternoon. So what do you want? Do you think I have enough money for you just to come back and take? - Anyway, finish your food. - I'm not in the mood to eat. I'm not asking for much. Only 200,000 dollars. Wait a moment. Let me have a word with your sister. Eat, eat. We agree the deal in principle. We'll discuss the details later. Excuse me. Chen Leh-Way, Long time no see! Seven years! Just now I hardly recognised you. You've changed a lot. That time, when you had to change school, there was no time to explain to you. - I felt really bad. - It doesn't matter! When I served in the army, I wrote many letters to you. - They were all returned! - I never knew! - What do you do now? - I work at an advertising agency. Just now I signed contracts with two clients. How about you? I work for a construction company. - Ah-Whay, a call for you. - Thanks. Hello? Yes, it's me! All right! See you tomorrow. Ah-Whay, Ah-Whay, Who was that man on the phone? No one. Just someone from work. - Ah-Whay, hurry up! - Coming. Hello! Yes, speaking. Where are you? What are you doing there? No! I'm going out with my mother to the department store. All right. Just wait a moment. Ma, I'm just going downstairs for a moment. Who was that man downstairs just now? Chen Leh-Way. Chen Leh-Way? That name sounds familiar... - Mr Chen, here's some tea. - Thank you. Er, where do you work? I majored in Construction in university. Now I work for a construction company We are similar. I majored in Machinery. Is the construction business improving now? Yes, but our company's projects are mostly things like bridges, roads, and underwater tunnels. Oh, infrastructure. You don't do residential buildings. What does your family do? My father used to work for a state-owned company, but now he has retired. Anyone else in the family? I have two younger brothers and a younger sister. They're studying. - Oh, so you're the eldest. - Yes. Our Ah-Whay isn't the eldest. Her brother does business, but he always loses money. Everyone in this family relies on her. It looks like we're all right, but actually we don't have anything. Ah-Whay’s father hasn't worked for two years. The monthly expense, the two young boys' school fees, food and clothes ... everything is on Ah-Whay. Yes, indeed. So whoever marries Ah-Whay will be lucky to have such a good woman. Mr. Sun, congratulations. - Mr. Sun, please drink some tea. - Thank you. Ah-Whay, marriage is so important to get right. It will be torture if your marriage isn't happy. Speaking frankly, every day you look gorgeous when going to the office. You don't need to serve anyone. You don't need to depend on anyone, either. Isn't it good to be so free? I think this boy, Chen Leh-Way, is the same as your father. He works for someone else. He has no ability. And he also has to maintain his own family. I think ... you need to think about it seriously, hmm? - I feel exhausted! - What's wrong? I don't know what's in my mother's mind. After graduating all I've ever tried to do is make money to support the family. I hadn't realised how the days have passed. Now I just don't know what to do. I have always obeyed her. After I come back from my business trip, I'll ask my father to call on your family. My mother won't let me go. I am afraid that the same thing in Junior High School will happen again. It won't happen again. Don't open the door! Why not? "Why not?" Your daughter comes home at half past three in the morning, and you ask me why! She's not a child anymore. What does it matter if she comes back late? Of course it matters! Dating a boy, coming back late. How can you think it's not important? Don't be like this! If you don't open the door, where else can she stay at this time of night? Who cares where she goes? Doesn't she have somewhere to go? It'd be better if she just didn't come home at all. Ah-Shing, go and open the door for her. You dare open that door? You'll see what happens! It's Lee When-Whay. Nothing. Good night. You came back! Come with me. I've run the hot water for you. Have a bath first. Hey ... what's going on? What is this?? Hey – what are you doing? What are you doing?? Don't touch me! Don't touch me! - Give me the scissors. - Get off! - Let me die. Let me die. - What's wrong? Let go, will you! Why is my fortune so bad? Why is my fortune so bad? Why have I raised such a daughter? She won't listen to me. What was the point of raising her? I brought her up with hard work and sacrifice, and now she won't even obey me. Hello. Who are you looking for? Oh, wait a moment. Assistant manager Li, telephone. Yes, this is Lee When-Whay. Ah-Whay. Father, what is it? You shut yourself in your room these days. You don't eat, or talk. This is no good. Whatever it is, please talk to me about it. Father, there is one thing I want to talk to you about. What's that? - I want to move out. - Move out?? That's not good. Your mother won't agree. Anyway ... let's talk about it when you come home. Tell him I am not in! Ma. Ma! I have decided to marry Chen Leh-Way. Ah-Whay, when your mother married your father your mother's father thought he was honest, and decided that I should marry him. Your grandfather said... "A woman's fortune is like rapeseed: it'll grow wherever it falls." Chen Leh-Whay is your own choice. It's good to make your own choice. But whether your husband is good or bad, it's all in your fate. Ah-Whay, mother has chosen the day for your marriage. The fortune teller said... December 29th is an auspicious day. But he said that mother should not attend your ceremony that day. The Bride God is not pleased with mother. He is the most important. So mother can't go on that day. But we can change it to another day! I have worked out your horoscopes. The fortune-teller said Ah-Whay must marry before she turns 30. She is 29 this year already. She can't put it off until next year. Daughter, I've seen you growing up... ... but I won't be able to see you wear the wedding dress on that day. It's not worth it. Ma, I can wear the dress before the wedding day, for you to see. Ah-Whay, remember everything mother has taught you. After he gives you the ring, keep your finger bent. You can't let him push it to the bottom of your finger. In your new home, keep your clothes above his clothes, otherwise, all your life you will be bullied by him. Another thing... the bridal flowers, the jewellery that I gave you, and earrings... you must remember to wear them. I know! Anything else you want? Do you need anything else? I want that doll. Ma, could you get it for me? Ma! Are you alright? Don't worry. Let mother have a good look at you. Ah-Whay, you are beautiful. How happy I am! Don't cry. Smile. You mustn't cry. Just smile. Be happy. You can't cry! Mother!
