[ Panting ] [ Cheering ] [ Speaking foreign language ] >> I do hope this will contribute to the peace in Texas. >> Damned if I can see how or why. You'd think they both had the same mom, them two. >> Well, britt Johnson says that one injun is responsible for his bringing back all those women and children the kiowas and comanches took last year. That bein' so, we owe him a considerable debt. >> Captain Barry, I want you to meet my kiowa brother, running dog. >> He speak texan? >> No, but I speak English. I hope you can understand. Black fox, my gift for you for winning the race. And pick one out for captain Barry. >> I don't know. I'll give you this one and mine for him. >> Oh no, not that one, he's sacred to me. He runs without even touching the ground. >> That's a fine horse, all right. >> Running dog, you sure I can't change your mind? >> Mrs. Holtz, how are you? >> Captain Barry, I'm not Mrs. Holtz anymore. I'm running dog's wife now. They call me morning star. >> Well, now that you're a man of peace, and walking the path, you won't be needing a war horse anymore. >> I walk the path of peace, and my tribe walks with me. But I will fight those texans if I'm attacked. >> [ Speaking foreign language ] Nobody from elm creek will ever attack you. That's why I brought captain Barry and sergeant dill here today, to convince US we all must be friends. >> The kiowa and the texans will never be friends. I walk the path of peace now, but I'll keep my war horse and my arrows ready. >> I have traveled far and wide in this great land, rain or shine, to bring the word of the lord to his chosen people. [ Thunder ] >> You here on elm creek, so brave and determined in the face of the attack by red savages a year ago, have lost loved ones and have suffered mightily. But I know that you have never lost faith. >> Amen! >> I know you will remain true to the word of god. >> Amen! >> As our white race spreads ever over this mighty continent, so that the savage races may be redeemed by our savior's pure blood, which is also the pure white blood of you brave Christian soldiers. >> Are you sure you want to be seen standing so close to a colored savage like me? If he's a follower of Jesus, I'm a horse's behind. Excuse me. >> You were chosen, you were tested-- >> [ speaking foreign language ] For a man who now only has to hunt meat to feed his people. >> If I kill with my own arrow, I know who did the killing. If I own this and hunt with others who use a rifle, who will know who killed the buffalo? >> Never thought about that. >> Well, I'm glad I can show you that Indians can think. >> Because I trust Mr. Johnson, and he trusts you, I believe that you'll do no more raidin' on the settlements that I'm responsible for, running dog. But I have to tell you that we're gonna rendezvous with our men and ride out to stake plain, join up with the rangers and chase down your war chief, lone wolf, and his bloody raiders. And we're not going to be so nice when we catch up to them. >> Lone wolf is not my chief now. There are too many of you here now to drive from these lands. But lone wolf has his own vision. >> Well, we ain't gonna catch any renegades sitting here. I appreciate the food, and the horse, and your pledge of peace. Ma'am, I have to ask, you want Mr. Johnson to take you back to your people at elm creek? >> These are my people now. I won't go back. >> Well, it's my duty to ask. Thanks for your hospitality, and good luck. >> [ Speaking foreign language ] [ Music playing ] [ Chattering, cheering ] [ Neighing ] >> Hey, Ralph. I didn't think you holtz's would drive all the way in here from hell and gone just for a little party. >> Didn't come for no party, Jordan. I got serious business to do. I'll be talking to you about it later. Ethan, take these horses down to the creek and give 'em water. >> Damn. >> Now, boy! [ Thunder ] >> Rev. Thorne? >> You'd be Ralph holtz? >> If you're done selling bibles, maybe me and you can do some business. >> Wouldn't be bibles that you're interested in, Mr. Holtz? >> Bible don't preach to what I got in mind, reverend. >> Now I wouldn't say that. An eye for an eye is a very simple dictum. And no man shall covet another man's wife. The Bible speaks plainly to your situation as I understand it, Mr. Holtz. >> Wouldn't let an innocent lamb see that, huh? >> Frank, honey, go over there near Mr. Holtz and that preacher he's talkin' to, try to listen to what they're talkin' about. Be smart about it. They don't like our kind. >> Yes, ma'am. >> I understand the heathen kiowa made off with your precious wife. >> They still got her. >> Peace, my brother. The lord has sent you the means of her deliverance. >> Had some traders ride down through my place recently. They'd been up in the territories. Said they'd come across a small camp of kiowa down by the washita river. Said there was a white woman with them. They described my wife. >> Get out of here, burr-head. >> Git boy, move it! That boy's father helped them kiowa to keep my wife after the raid last year. I'll get him for it some day. >> You remember this place? This is the first place we stopped on elm creek when we got here three years ago. >> We all ran right down and waded right in the water. Swam all day till dark. Times I thought we'd never reach this destination. >> We're so lucky for everything we have here, Sarah. We're gonna prosper here. And after the war's over, everything's gonna start growing again. Maybe we'll be blessed with children. >> No. >> Sarah, please. >> I'm sorry Alan, I can't. [ Heavy breathing, moaning ] >> Hey frank, I'm home. >> Daddy, you're back. >> Hey, how ya doin' frank? Ahh! I got a present for you. >> Is one of those horses mine? >> Yep, I think that spotted one is about your size. Isn't it? >> Help me on him, dad. >> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They ain't like our horses, frank. They--they need a little work. Look, I'm tired and I'm hungry. I want you to take these horses and lead them to water, all right? >> All right. [ Chuckles ] >> Britt? Britt? >> Mary. Mary, look at you! Come here! Come here! Say, brother. >> Say, britt. Glad to see you back. Still got your scalp in one place, huh? Looks like you bought a couple horses, too. >> Oh, I won those racing. And I think running dog was being friendly by lettin' me win. You know, he had a much better horse that he didn't want to dishonor by racing. I've never seen such an animal. >> You know something britt? Your friendliness with those Indians doesn't sit too well with some people around here. Your liable to get US all in trouble someday. >> Oh, I think I'm saving this community a whole lot of trouble by being friendly with these Indians. Running dog is definitely walking the path of peace, and I want to keep it that way. >> Yeah, well you and I will just have to disagree on the subject of comanches and kiowas. Not gonna change my mind on that subject. There you go, boy. >> How's Sarah? >> Not good. She's still not getting over what happened to her. What about Mrs. Holtz? Did you see her up in the territory? >> She's much happier now that she doesn't have Ralph holtz beatin'up on her all the time. She's not coming back. >> Ah, britt, I hope you know what you're doing. You're putting yourself right in between two groups of people that hate each other. You're gonna get yourself shot in the back by somebody red or white. >> Man can't live worrying about dyin', brother. Come on, let's go get something to eat. I ain't had nothin' but buffalo meat and bear grease all week. >> Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before Christ, the royal master-- >> look, daddy. There's that preacher mama was telling you about. >> Onward into battle-- >> that wagon is sure ridin' mighty heavy. >> He must have a ton of bibles in the back there, huh? >> I seen him talkin' to Mr. Holtz, daddy. They didn't want me to hear 'em but they was talkin' about Indians. >> You mind seein' frank back to the corral? >> Yeah, sure. >> I'm gonna go see what this preacher's up too. >> All right. [ Gunfire ] >> Mary? >> Sarah, Alan. Sit down, I'll get some coffee. Where's frank? >> Got him outside in the garden weeding. >> Well what are we doin' here? Takin' the rest of the day off? >> I followed that preacher. >> So called preacher. >> Followed him down to Ralph holtz's. >> Oh Mary, no thanks. Bet he was real glad to see you joined their party. >> I watched him from the river over by holtz's place. >> Yeah. >> And I found out the reason that preacher's wagon is ridin' so heavy in the dirt. >> Why? >> He's a gun runner. >> Gunrunner? >> They took what looked like a hundred Henry rifles out the back of that preacher's wagon. Holtz fired one of them things faster than any repeater I ever seen. >> What's a civilian doin' with repeatin' rifles? I mean, you think they'd be with the armies, right? North or south. >> I don't know. But if he's a friend of holtz's, he must have stolen 'em. >> I don't know how good people could listen to that man's words and not know he's up to no good. >> What's holtz doin' with repeating rifles? >> He was talking about his wife being held by the kiowa when frank was listening. >> All right. Let's-- let's talk about this another time, all right? >> No. I don't mind. Can't very well go on living in Texas if nobody's allowed to mention Indians around me. >> If there is as many rifles in the back of that preacher's wagon as I figure. >> And with captain Barry gone off chasing comanche raiders on the stake plains. >> Holtz must be planning on raisin' an army to ride down against running dog's kiowa band. Now he must know that they split off from lone wolf. >> Well, the man's got a right to get his wife back. >> Not if she doesn't want to come home to a man that beats her. >> All right, let's you and me talk this out another time. >> Talk it out here, say what has to be said. >> Alan, I know how you feel about what happened to Sarah. >> And what happened to you. >> I didn't have it as bad as she did. But it wasn't a picnic for any of US that was taken hostage. Now Ralph holtz is just that kind of man that might start something that would never end. >> Well, it's never going to end till you get all the Indians moved out of this area. >> This was their land before it was ours. Where the hell are they gonna go? >> I thought they got away from hatred when we left the south and slavery. >> If britt says this chief is a good man then he must be. And we must show him understanding, Alan. >> Understanding? How can you say that? He rode on that raid with all the others. >> Alan. [ Coyote howls ] >> Are you angry at him, britt? >> No. No, it's more like I'm sad. You know, Alan and I we-- we have so many plans together, well, we all have plans together. But they way he feels, I don't know. >> Alan has good reason for the way he feels. >> You don't feel that way, I don't feel that way. I don't know, Mary, maybe they're just not strong like US. >> Now don't you start talking like that. That's just the other side of what that preacher was saying. They are just people, like US. If we're strong it's because we've had to be strong just to stay alive. Now let's get some sleep, hmm? >> You thinking about Ralph holtz? >> Uh-huh. >> You know Alan, maybe britt was guessing wrong, maybe those rifles weren't even for that purpose. >> It's been a year now, Sarah. Every time I go to touch you I feel the shivers running up and down your body. When I think about you suffering with those Indians, I hate them so much that I could go on a killing rampage myself. >> I just don't know if I could take it if it started all up again. The killing. Alan, I'm getting better. When my mind goes to that, I pray. Comes back a little less strong each time. >> I love you so much. >> Make love to me. [ Horse neighs ] >> Look at me, dad. >> Hey boy, now you take it easy on that pony. She's only half broke, yet. >> Oh, let him alone, britt. Can't hurt himself too much if he falls off in this grass. >> Alan, don't tell me how to raise my boy and I won't tell you how to raise yours when you have one. >> Hey Alan, i--I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put it that way. >> It's all right, it's all right. You don't have to pussyfoot around that subject anymore. One day soon Sarah's gonna be over all of that and we're gonna have ourselves half a dozen kids. >> All right, papa. But I hope she has 14 brats and you have to change diapers on each and every one of them. >> Yeah, Sarah is getting better. I gotta quit worrying about it, otherwise she never will. >> Yeah. And I shoulda never mentioned that talk last night about holtz and the Indians. >> Oh, that's all right, you had to bring it up. That's part of her getting over it. I just hope you don't expect me to do something I can't do. I also hope you don't bite off more than you can chew. What you did last year, bringing those captives back after the raid, that's more than any man can ever thank you for. I just hope it doesn't make you think that you can overcome an eternity of hatred in this world all by yourself. >> You throwing everything you had in Carolina, to get me and my family out of slavery? I could never match that. But just remember, you set the standard for laying it on the line for other people. >> Thanks, just hope you don't expect me to ever care much about Indians. Not anymore. >> Jim Jordan, I need to talk to you. >> Hello Ralph. Boys. >> Jim. I'm looking for volunteers to go up on a hunting party up in the territories. I want you to go along. >> Nice looking rifles. You must be going after big game. >> The injuns still got my young wife. We intend to get her back. >> Who's "we"? How many you got? >> I got enough. >> Well, are you riding with US? >> Kiowas may not wanna give her back. >> Won't be no more kiowas when we get through. I got over a dozen of these. Intend to put a man behind each one. >> Vigilante. >> Well, are you in? >> We started this sort of thing against the Mexicans down in San Antonio when I was there. Lots died before it ended. >> Lots will die this time, too. Are you a white man or not? >> I was the last time I looked. >> We're riding up the creek, stopping at every ranch. I'm putting on a big feed up at my place day after tomorrow. Bring your jug, we'll have a good time. >> Thought you didn't like parties. >> This ain't just a party, Jordan. We'll be making plans. >> What about britt Johnson? He's friends with that kiowa bunch. He know about this? >> That nigger gets in my way one more time, he's gonna swing from a rope. >> Ya! >> Ya! >> I'm a beef contractor, fellas. So I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. There's a war on and the troops need meat. So I'm gonna make you a little proposition. I'd like to get up a herd, drive it down to fort worth then on to Louisiana. You boys could make as much as twelve dollars a head, less my commission, of course. So what do you say, do you want in? >> Which troops do you intend to feed with our beef, Mr. Wilson, north or south? >> That's politics, Mr. Johnson. I'm a businessman. Whoever wants to buy them can eat them any way they want. >> Well, I don't much fancy feeding confederate soldiers. >> You suffer from the same scruples as your partner here? >> I don't support the confederate cause, Mr. Wilson. >> The buyers I've contacted at this point happen to be Yankees. Their barges are on the river at shreveport. >> I'll take you at your word, Mr. Wilson. You can talk to my brother about the price. >> Say, I've been to a couple of ranches today and it sounds like somebody's trying to get up a war against some Indians. You part of that? >> Thanks. >> When does Wilson intend to move the herd? >> Soon as he gets them rounded up. >> You going with them? >> Far as fort worth. You? >> Well, I'll help you get them together but I ain't goin' nowhere with all this business goin' on. You don't need me, do you? >> No, I'll be fine. [ Horse neighs ] [ Cows moo ] >> Gentlemen. >> Howdy. >> If you're lookin' for cattle we got some other brands mixed in with ours, but we'll cut out a few for you if you want. >> We're going down to holtz' place. Ain't you goin'? >> Holtz didn't send me no invitation. >> He ain't welcome at holtz's. >> No offense. >> None taken. >> Alan. >> Yes? >> You're gonna have to finish up without me. >> Why? Where you goin'? >> I gotta go see about something. >> All right. >> All right? >> Yep. Come on, move on, bring 'er around that way. [ Chattering ] >> Hey, give me that. >> Dwayne, how's that doin', boy? >> Think it's bout ready, pa. >> Well why didn't you tell me? All right everybody, come and get it. Carve off whatever you want, there's lots for everybody. Ethan, here. >> Yes, pa. >> Get them guns off the wagon. We're gonna have US some fun. >> Mm-hmm. [ Chattering continues ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunfire continues ] [ Cow moos ] [ Horse neighs ] >> Say, britt, where you been? >> I figured right. Holtz's got his whole clan, maybe twelve more men, outfitted with those Henry's. He's gonna have them into an army before he gets done. >> Well, what do you want me to do about it? >> Well, I could use some advice. >> Well, can't take an army by yourself. Even if I was inclined to help you, which I'm not, two men can't take on twelve. >> You know I'm not saying that the settlement owes me for getting their women back when they couldn't have got them back. I'm just sayin' they owe me enough to listen. >> Yeah, I sure owe you that much. Shoot, if holtz has got that many men riding with him, may not be many left to try to stop them. >> Well, holtz and them, they were just getting drunk and having target practice right now. They ain't ready to ride yet. Why don't you help me to gather as many people as we can? >> All right. >> Fella. I think that's about all that's coming, Brett. >> Let's see, you want to-- I ain't much good at making speeches. You wanna tell 'em what's going on? >> It's your cause. You'll have to do the talking. >> All right. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'm glad you all could come to town. Uh, I'll get right to the point. Mr. Ralph holtz is gettin' together an army, vigilantes. He's going after his wife who's now living with a peaceful band of kiowas. >> Ain't no such thing as peaceful kiowas. We all learned that last year. >> These kiowa are led by a man who helped US bring our women and children back after last year's raids. He's a man of peace now. He swore it to me and to captain Barry. >> He's the one who has Ralph holtz's wife. >> That's her own free will. >> Now britt, it's been a year. I'm sure holtz is just gonna go make sure his wife don't wanna come back to him. I would. >> She don't. And holtz knows that. Last year after all the others came back she chose to stay with running dog. Captain Barry asked the woman again if she wanted to come back to holtz and she said no. She's even taken an Indian name. >> My brother-in-law is just goin' to make sure. >> I think he's goin' for revenge. >> I think you're an injun lover. I ain't. And I ain't sittin' around here listening to no hog wash. Ralph wants his wife back. And he has a right to go get her. >> What do you want US to do, britt? >> Running dog is a peaceful man. But he ain't gonna let holtz take her back by force. Now we gotta stop holtz from taking his army up there. >> Then the injuns will just get what's corning to them. >> Look, holtz bought cases of Henry repeating rifles off that preacher come through here the other day. Running dog's braves have bows and arrows. It'll be a massacre over what? Over some woman who doesn't want to come home? Is that what you all want? >> We ain't soldiers, britt, and I gotta drive my cattle to fort worth. I think if them Indians are peaceful now, there won't be any problems. I don't see what we can do till captain Barry gets back. >> That'll be too late. I gotta do something, Alan. You got any ideas? >> I'm gonna drive cattle to fort worth. Look, you can't ask me to care about Indians, britt. There's nothing I can do about it anyway. Some things just can't be stopped. >> Running dog is my brother, Alan. I thought you might understand that. >> I said I might have to swing britt Johnson from a rope. Or something close to it. >> How'd I ever get so lucky? >> A man makes his own luck, you like to say. >> I'm countin' on you and Mary to keep britt from doin' anything foolish while I'm gone. >> Well, Mary and I always try to keep either of you two from being fools on your own. We know how much you like being fools together. I love you. >> Uncle Alan's leaving for fort worth, dad. Let me go with him. >> No, boy. Next time. You ain't old enough to go on that trail yet. You just let him go. >> Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. I'm ready. Let's drive 'em on down south. Come on! >> The hero of the tale which I beg the muse to help me tell is that resourceful man who roamed the wide world after he had sacked the holy citadel of Troy. He saw the cities of many peoples and he learnt their ways. He suffered many hardships on the high seas in his struggles to preserve his life and bring his comrades home. But he failed to save those comrades, in spite of all his effort. >> Mary, if I can't get help around here to stop holtz's gang, I'm gonna have to ride to the territories. >> What good would that do? >> I could maybe persuade running dog to head to the mountains. >> Mountains won't stop holtz. He's killed Indians before. >> Then I'll ride to the stake plains, find captain Barry and bring him back. >> Why would he come, britt? >> Because he's a fair man. >> Fair? Alan is a fair man but you can't make him love Indians. [ Banging ] >> Oh my god! >> Hold it right there. [ Screams ] >> Get in the bedroom, get under the bed and don't make a sound no matter what. [ Grunts ] [ Gunshot ] >> That's two empty barrels, bitch! >> I wanna kill you, Ralph holtz! Please make a move so I can do it with a clear conscience. >> Throw down your guns, get on your horses and get out of here. >> And take him with you. >> Come on. [ Groaning ] >> This ain't the end of it! [ Gunshot ] >> Ya! >> Ya! >> It's okay, baby. It's okay. >> Oh god. >> Mama, is he alright? >> It's all right, baby, it's all right. >> I'll ride for uncle Alan. >> No. You stay here and help your mother and guard the house. I'll get Alan. >> I can walk. I can walk. >> Hang on, sweet baby-- >> I can walk-- >> hang on, britt. >> Hang on. [ Coughs ] >> Get me some water, some alcohol and some cloth. >> I'll be all right. >> Yeah. You'll be all right. [ Horse approaching ] >> That Jeb coming in? >> Alan! >> Sarah! What are you doin' here? >> It's britt, he's hurt. >> What happened? >> Ralph holtz. >> How is he? >> He looks terrible. >> He'll be all right. A few broken ribs and a broken nose, but he'll live. >> Hey. Who's there? Who's there? >> It's Alan, britt. And Sarah. >> I can't see straight. >> Well, that's all right. You never could think straight. >> Is everybody all right? We're fine. >> I-I gotta get up. >> No britt. >> Mary, Mary, pack me some biscuits. And Alan, saddle my horse. >> Where the hell do you think you're going? >> I gotta go warn running dog. >> Now listen to me. Where was running dog's camp when you were up there? >> Due north. Where red river meets cache creek. Why? >> I'll go. I'll just use that dun horse, put a bag of grain on him. I'm gonna wash up, get changed. >> Sarah, I'll help you pack some food. You stay put. You stay put. >> Uncle Alan, i-- >> frank, come here. >> You're a good man, Alan Johnson. >> I'm a damn fool. I only got one brother. >> And he's a damn fool, too. >> You know what? I'm not gonna argue with you. >> All right. >> It's just some dried beef, biscuits and coffee. >> Thanks. >> Thanks, son. You take care of your father. >> You look after him. >> Britt! Britt! >> Oh my god. >> Have you gone crazy? You can't get on that horse! >> The hell I can't. Help me on this horse. >> I will not. If you can't get on the horse, then you aren't fit to ride it! [ Grunts ] >> You're gonna be a lot of help. >> Both fools. >> Damn fools. >> Watch your words, mama. [ Laughing ] >> What are you two laughing at? >> You. Last night you was all set to shoot that white woman when that--that other woman come out the door with a shotgun behind you-- >> that ain't funny! Well, we beat the booger bad enough he gonna stay out of our way! >> Sure did. >> Come on, boys, let's go! [ Shouting ] >> Oh, easy boy, easy. >> What are you slowing down for? Can't you keep up the pace? >> Britt, you gotta take it easy. Can't go too fast. >> Water your horses! We'll camp here tonight. [ Chattering ] >> How much farther do you think it is? >> Another day and a half, if I don't die and these horses don't give out. [ Chattering ] >> What if these injuns just run off on US? They've had scouts out there all day flanking US. They know we's coming. >> Our friend the preacher'll make sure they won't run off. He's gonna sell 'em a bunch of guns. Them rusty ole flintlocks he got in his wagon. They ain't gonna do US too much harm. Just make 'em brave enough to stand and fight. >> Damn dumb injuns, fall for a trick like that. >> Hey, brother. Sun's up. Let's ride. >> Here you go. >> All right? >> Yeah. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Gunshot ] >> What? >> Injuns! [ Clamoring ] >> I slept out here on the cold ground last night. My young wife, she slept on a bear skin and fur hides with another man, not even a white man. But a red nigger injun! I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna tear his heart out. I'm gonna eat his liver raw! Saddle up, all of you! Come on, move it! [ Gunshot ] >> Now, all you gotta do to reload-- Here, ready to fire again, slick as a whistle. [ Gunshot ] >> We don't want your guns, they'll just bring the white eyes riding down on US. If we use the guns, they will fear US. White eyes kill what they fear. >> What I'm trying to tell you, chief, is that the white eyes are riding down on ya right now. You took this man's wife away from him and he intends to get her back. Now if I read this fellow right, and I know I do, he's not gonna be satisfied with just getting the lady back in his arms. He and his army is planning to kill each and every one of you Indians. You understand? Now them bows and arrows your boys are carrying just ain't gonna get the job done. You need to purchase a bunch of these. >> When will these men come? >> Any day now. I heard them talking about it, I saw them buying up ammunition. And I figured I just better high tail it up here to make sure you had something to protect yourself with, my red brother. Our lord Jesus Christ teaches US that all men are brothers under the skin. [ Speaking kiowa ] >> If you buy up all these guns I got, I'll throw in ten jugs of this whiskey. Free! Your men will fight better with a little whiskey in them. [ Speaking kiowa ] >> There's a preacher out there who wants to trade whiskey and guns to US because Ralph holtz wants to start a war. >> It would be like him to come looking for vengeance. And with captain Barry out of the way now is the time he would pick to come. He's a cruel man. If he's been thinkin' on this for a year... I don't want people killed. I don't want you killed. I'll go back to him. >> No. You will not go back. My heart would die. What do you want for your guns, all of them? Well, I prefer gold or greenbacks. But I'll take hides, furs, what do you got? >> Where'd those fellas get rifles? I thought the kiowa were walkin' the path of peace. >> I wonder. Looks like somebody got here before we did. [ Speaking kiowa ] >> Welcome. >> Running dog, my friend. >> Looks like you butted heads with a buffalo, huh? >> Something like that. You remember my brother, Alan Johnson. >> You can come down off your horse. We won't bite you. It looks like the white eyes are coming to fight. >> Yes. And they have rifles that fire like lightning, every one of them. Where did your braves get these old flintlocks they're carrying? >> Hello, black fox. Mr. Johnson. >> Ma'am. [ Speaking kiowa ] >> No! I need to hear this. They're coming for me. >> Where did your people get these old rifles? Did a white eye preacher come through here? >> Yes, he's an evil man. >> Let me see. Misfire. [ Gunshot ] These are worthless. >> I told you I would not start a war. But I will fight any attacker of my people. >> And you'll be slaughtered, all of you. Look, running dog, let me take your people to the mountains. At least there if you fight the mountains will be on your side. >> I will not run away. >> Then let me take your women and children then. >> I will think on this. First I must offer food to my brother and his brother. >> There's no time, running dog. >> I have my braves watching for white eyes. They will warn me before they come. And when they come, I will fight. >> Morning star, you have to convince him. This will be a massacre. >> I've tried. But when he decided to walk the path of peace, he had a vision. He did not see himself running away. >> Something bothering you? >> I guess they're just people. >> Running dog, will you let US lead your women and children away? >> When the dianos come back, the women and children will not be here. But I will not run away. [ Cocks gun ] >> Mrs. Holtz? >> Where is Ralph? >> He's camped down there by them bushes. [ Snoring ] >> Ralph. >> What? Delores? >> I've come to go back with you. >> Oh... Oh, feels so good to hold you again. >> I want you-- US to turn around and ride out of here now. >> But you're my wife. >> I'll be your wife when we get back to elm creek. >> Throw some more wood on the fire and make US coffee. Livin' with the injuns, you forget what coffee is? Go on, move, girl! [ Children laughing ] >> Morning star. Did she come back? >> No. When we fight, you will be with them? >> No. >> Then you'll stand with US? >> My heart is with you. Look, running dog, they'll kill US all if there's a fight. My family is back with the white eyes. They'll kill them if they find out that I fought against their people for you. >> Well, then you better leave now before the war begins. >> If morning star went back to Ralph holtz, there may not be a fight. >> You said he wants revenge, not just the woman. I will be ready. >> Which way did the white eye preacher go that sold you those worthless guns? >> They say he's on the bluff by the river, with ten ponies wife. Ten ponies is half a man, he traded whiskey for the use of his woman. >> How far to the bluffs by the river? >> Half a day's ride. Less. >> I'll be back. Look, running dog, if you care about your people, you will lead them to the mountains. Why do both my brothers cause me so much pain? >> Want some coffee? >> Nope. >> What's going on? >> Morning star's gone back to Ralph holtz. Presumably to stop the massacre, I reckon. >> That's best. There's nothing we can do here either way, britt. >> There's one thing I can do. >> What? >> That preacher's still in the area. >> So? >> Well maybe I can't step in the middle of it. But if people get killed, captain Barry's gonna want the one responsible. You comin' with me? >> Yeah. I'll see you through. >> I want you to be my wife right now. >> I told you, I'll be your wife when we get back to elm creek. >> You lay with the redskin nigger, didn't you girl? >> I won't defy you again. >> Oh, oh, you won't ever defy me again. Never. >> No, no. No! No! [ Grunts ] >> Ethan! Crane! Stop her! Don't let her go! >> Delores! Easy girl. Put that rifle down now. >> Grab her, tie her up! >> Oh! [ Horse neighs ] [ Coughs ] >> It really hurts. >> Her and her Indian chief are gonna die for this! Saddle up! Saddle up. >> What do you intend doing when you find that preacher? >> I don't know. I never looked the devil in the eye before. I guess I get to do so today. >> Yeah. >> I'll try my best to keep from hangin' or shootin' that sonofabitch. >> Whoa. >> Ten ponies wife. Running dog said she had been with that preacher. Come on! Preacher man, where is he? Fire-stick man, fire-stick man, whiskey man, whiskey man. [ Speaking kiowa ] [ Speaking kiowa ] [ Speaking kiowa ] >> We're moving? >> Yes, we must. >> Christ, our royal master, lead them as to war... >> Yah! >> Yah, git, git! [ Gunshots ] >> He's dead! >> Alan, come here! >> He must have held up an army supply wagon to get that. [ Gunshots ] [ Clamoring ] [ War cries ] >> Hold your fire! Stop firing! Stop firing! They're just harassing US! >> Hold up. >> Now go slow. Keep your guns out and reload if you wasted ammunition. >> We won't get to cache creek before dark at this pace. >> We'll get there. Come on, let's move! Come on! [ Shouting ] [ Speaking kiowa ] >> Here we go. That it, here we go. Here we go. Keep it coming. Little more. >> That's it. Let it go. That's good. [ Indians singing ] >> Must be hunkering down. It's gonna be a dark night. They'll never see US coming. >> Just working up their courage. >> Well, let's hit 'em. >> No. We'll wait until sun up. Don't want none of 'em running off in the dark. I want 'em dead! >> No more of that tonight. Get some sleep. We'll ride in on 'em at first light. Any of 'em run off, hunt 'em down! >> Whoa, whoa. [ Indians singing ] >> Let's go! [ Shouting ] [ Gunfire ] [ Shouting continues ] [ Gunfire ] >> Hold it! Hold it! Stop firing. Listen. Listen. [ Shouts ] >> It's a trap! [ War cries, gunfire ] [ Shouts ] >> There's the bastard that stole my wife! [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] >> Hold it! Hold it here. Come on, get in line! Hurry! [ War cries ] [ Gunfire ] >> Ya! [ Gunfire ] [ Shouting ] >> Anyone moves, I'll cut him down! [ Horse whinnies ] [ Cocks gun ] >> Holtz, holtz, I said hold your fire! >> No, don't. Let him go. It's gotta end. [ Shouts ] [ Gunshot ] [ Groans ] >> I told you when I kill an animal with my arrow you will know who did the killing. >> You keep yourself alive. >> You stay alive too, brothers. >> Pick 'em up and ride south. I'll fire on anyone who goes after those Indians. Move! [ Gunfire ] [ Shouting ] >> Got you. >> Okay. >> You got it? >> Yeah. Let's get balanced. One. >> Easy. >> Two. Three. >> Let's go home.
