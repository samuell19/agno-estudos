I was the one who found you. You were the only survivor. Pinky... Longfinger! What's that? But I'm no baby anymore. Why can't I go on the raid? Because we already have a deckhand, pinky. And we're going to ape island. The most dangerous island in the seven seas. - Be quiet. - Yeah, yeah. Looks like we have arrived. - Atishoo! - Hush! Hey, didrik, get down. We're going in there. Longfinger, there are deadly apes in there. We have a treasure to find, and you're standing here babbling? Move on. I saw that, obviously. Come on, longfinger. One, two, three, four, five, six... Seven, eight, nine, ten. Wally, wimp... Dig. What's the point of burying an empty chest?! - Captain... - What? "In lam... In lama rama, king Rufus reigns." "In lama rama, king Rufus reigns." "His palace brims with gold and jewels." "His most precious treasure is the king's Pearl." This is a map that shows us the route to lama rama. Stop him! Pinch his nose! Stand very, very still. Nobody make a noise. Save yourselves, everybody! We're going to die! Run! Run! Apes are afraid of water. Back to the beach. Come on, come on. Help! Mommy! Help! Hurry! Are they afraid of water? Are you little apes afraid of water? I think we need a new deckhand, captain. That hurt! Mommy! Set course for abra harbour. Send the raven with a message that we're on our way. Write that there will be an ordeal by fire when we arrive. And that the winner will be our new deckhand on our next raid. Finally we know the sea route to lama rama. Pinky! Pinky! Up here! Captain sabertooth is on his way and needs a new deckhand. - Uh-uh... - Is that true? Yes, there's an ordeal by fire tomorrow and the winner can go on the next raid. There's something you have to help me with first. Come. Hi, pinky! Longfinger's coming tomorrow. You have to tidy up. - I will. - You're lucky he lets you live there. I know. Ok, the ordeals by fire start there, and you have to run to that edge. - You can do that easily. - I need help with something first. - What? - I can't swim. What? You can't swim? No. “What? I never had anybody to teach me. Ok, off with your shoes. “What? Take your shoes off. Ok, now what? - What are you doing? - That's how dad taught me. - Get to the edge! - I can't! You have to try! Help me! - Try to grab the rope! - I can't! Look at that moron. Didn't you have a dad to teach you to swim? - How's that possible? - Moron! Hi, pinky. So, how is everything? Ready for the ordeal by fire? Now's your chance. Or... Er, how... Get your feet moving, longfinger. Sure. You're going to do well swimming... Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh... was it you who made that noise? You want me to set you free? Did that make you happy? Maybe you'd like an apple? Or maybe you'd prefer a banana? What do fishermen need swords for? Pirates. Come, we must tell captain sabertooth. Not even a hundred furious apes could stop us. Finally the world's greatest treasure, the lama rama treasure, is to be mine come on... But first of all, we need a new deckhand. Conrad, the mooring line. - Where do you think you're going? - Let's have an ordeal by fire! They're stealing the ship... They're stealing the ship! The dark lady! Bjarn the brave, you lousy traitor! You swore to serve the king of the seven seas for eternity! I will chase you to the ends of the earth! You can try to catch me in my old bucket of a ship, pasty face. - Pinky! - Help! My revenge will be harsh and ruthless. This is how we bid farewell to losers. - We'll chase them. - In brave's old bucket? Do you think I'll let that codfish of a Norwegian ruin my bad reputation. We'll set course for the marmalades. When those condescending whatnots spot the dark lady, they'll throw their gold at us, because they'll think it's sabertooth. Smartly now, wenches! That goes for you too, Conrad. Get that fat ass of yours moving. Get everything aboard. This bucket is sailing in 10 minutes. Aye, captain. - Hey! What do you think you're doing? - I must save pinky. You're not going to save anyone. I'll talk to longfinger about that, my little friend. Give me that key. Give me the key, raven! Raven! Let me go, you stupid tub of lard! - You'll never get away with this! - I see... a feisty little sprog. What's your name, sprog? - What's your name? - Pinky. Pinky...! What a name. Pinky... some years ago I met a moron from abra harbour who said he'd named his son pinky. Was that your father? - Was his name Morgan? - Maybe. My dad's name was Morgan. Let go! But that can't be! He drowned just after I was born. He was far from dead when I met him. You're lying! Where is he? Where did you last see him? I can tell you a lot more about Morgan, your dad... If you tell me what this is. What does it say? What does it say?! You're useless pirates if you can't even read a treasure map. Frida... Just tell us what it says. I refuse! Captain sabertooth would never forgive me. Let him walk the plank. That'll make him talk. - Come here now! Come here! - No! Pinky, pinky... All alone in the world. Come on, or would you like to taste my steel? - Come on now! - Do you want to swim with the sharks? What does the map say? What does the map say?! No, no! The treasure map shows the route to lama rama. Lama rama? You're lying. Lama rama doesn't exist. We found it on ape island, in a chest with maga Khan's name on it. Maga Khan...? If you're lying, I'll cut your ears of and serve them to Conrad. - Me? - I'm not lying, I swear! Set course south south-west for lama rama! - Can I Chuck him overboard now? - No, we need someone who can read. Conrad, tie him up below deck. If you get up to something, you'll be shark bait. Hello? You followed me. Come and help me. Please, untie me. Longfinger! Full speed ahead! These sails are too old. We must shorten sails if the wind picks up. We're losing them. We're not shortening anything! Get us out of this peasouper! But how...? It's not possible,.. Bjorn! Frida! Captain sabertooth in sight! Can that be? When we get the dark lady up to full speed, no one can catch us There must be a telescope somewhere in this old bucket. More speed! Longfinger! Why is this door locked? He didn't see that one coming. - Stowaways. - No. No, no. It was an accident. Longfinger, throw these chickens overboard to get our speed up. You just try! Enough... cackling. Get these wenches out of my sight and get me a telescope. What are you doing here? You can't be here. - Pinky's my friend and I must save him. - That's my job, not yours. You only do what sabertooth tells you. - You're a very feisty lady, Rosa. - Thanks. I take that as a compliment. - Damn hellcat! - What did you say? Telescope. I said, telescope... Tully? There it is. We must cut the sails and stop the ship. - You mean mess with those bandits? - Yes, and you must help me. - I don't want to be shark bait. - Should I do it alone then? Hang on. You take care of the bandits and I'll make you a lovely rat stew. Getting close. Grab that wretched squirt! Stop him! - Stop him! - I've got hi... Conrad! Get him! Frida! Get him, Frida! He's going for the sail! Get that squirt down! Now you're done for, you miserable tadpole. No, no, no! You're done for... codfish. Put down that sword. Bjarn the brave... Pinky! - Hi! - You alright? We've damaged all their sails, captain. Let them drift to the ends of the earth and fall off the edge. - Get the speed up now, boys. - That goes to the galley. So you think you can get the better of bjorn the brave? - Bring out the spare sails. - They're completely rotten. Frida! Stretch me! - Was it you who stopped them? - Yes. Crew! We are bound for lama rama! On our way to the treasure all pirates dream of getting their hands on. Today one of you has proved himself to be a true pirate hero. It was he who saved the dark lady from bjgrn the brave and his band of men. Tully. Tully, good work. I've never liked that green rat soup of yours. Do something. But today you have proved yourself to be one of my very best men. I only did my best, captain. Those crooks didn't stand a chance against my rolling pin. It was pinky who saved the ship. Next time you address the king of the seven seas without permission you and that twig of a seaweed may well end up as shark bait! Is that clear? Longfinger, have those mushrooms scrub the deck until it shines. And we'll find a proper deckhand when we get back. Set course for lama rama! - Aren't you going to tell the captain - Yes, I... Hey, cheer up. You're going on a raid to lama rama. Not bad. Bjarn the brave said my dad isn't dead. Bjoern the brave? What does he know about that? He said that he'd met him some years ago. Pinky, bjgrn the brave is a crook and a fibber. He's lying. Why would he lie about that? Bjarn the brave has obviously given you hope. And hope can be dangerous. It can make you blind, and make you spoil things for yourself and others. Do you understand? You've proved that you're going to be good pirate. Sabertooth will see that. But you have to promise me that you'll forget everything to do with your dad. Agreed? Agreed. And one more thing: If we're going to test these cannons before the storm we'll have to start now. Come on! Get a move on, you lousy slackers! It's time for a raid then the deck will need scrubbing and the cannons will need loading it's time for a raid it's time to set sail then we'll heave up the anchor then we'll batten down the hatches it's time to set sail heave ahoy here we stand set sail for a far-off land it's time to get rich row to land when it's midnight then we'll dig up lots of treasure it's time to get rich it's time Pinky! We have arrived. Everything's made of gold... There's a secret guard entrance at the back of the palace. - We'll slip in there. - How do we unlock the door? You and Rosa pose as a German married merchant couple. - Married? - You were caught in a storm. Your sails got damaged, and you'll ask to stay until tomorrow. - Rosa and I are... - What?! - We're... married? - Is that a problem? No, that's not a problem. While you're in the palace, we'll go ashore. You will take out the guard at the door as night falls. Then we'll unlock the door and let you in? Afterwards we'll help ourselves to the treasures while they're asleep... And set course for abra harbour at dawn with the king's Pearl on board. Look at this. Oh, Tully-boy! Hero of the ship! How... lovely you look. How perfect you look... For the job, just perfect... yeah. - Get going now. - What about pinky and raven? This is a job for captain sabertooth's men. The mushrooms will stay on board ship. - You promised we could go. - There's nothing I can do. You know just as well as me that pinky has earned his place on this raid. - If you had any backbone... - This is no sewing club, Rosa. It's a pirate ship. The captain's calling the shots. All hands on deck! Start operation German merchant ship. - The flag! - Lower the flag, Benjamin. - The skull! - Cover the skull! - Cover the cannons! - Cover the cannons! - Get a move on! - Smartly, you useless idlers! Remember that we're from Germany, ok? We have to speak German. Deutsch. We'll be fine. - That cheeky shrimp. - You defied sabertooth's orders. You'll wait in this boat until Wally and wimp return. - Longfinger. - Is that clear? Longfinger! Move along now. Move along. My name's prince badal, and I'm the brother of the... - Beloved... - And popular... - And popular... - And funny... And funny king Rufus of lama rama. Long live king Rufus! And you are...? Monsieur prince badal, I am lord fandango of Germany. And this is my petite cherie, lady fandango of Germany. - Not France? - France? No. Germany. You know, champagne, baguette, chateau neuf... Chat noir, chateau marmont, chat de fuck up... Roquefort, rock'n'roll, fish balls, camembert... Germany. Und mein husband comes from die grense, just between... - Germany! - Yes. And francois. Yes, yes... Away from lama rama. Raus! Hello, hello! What a lovely day it is. Hello to you. Isn't this funny? Why not? If you're a king, you're a king. Yes, yes, yes. And who are these funny characters? Je m'appelle... mein nam ist... This is lord fandango. - What did you say. Lord...? - Fandango. Lord fandango...! Excuse me, but I've never heard that before. Sorry, it's just... that's so funny it sounds like something you made up. - No. - They claim to be shipwrecked. - And in need of provisioning. - Badal... We have guests. We haven't had anyone shipwrecked here for 20 years. We can have a party! That means food, drink, dancing and not least... - Fun and games! - They don't want your fun and games. - Nonsense! - Don't do that! No one can resist my amazing collection of fun and games. Except you. Konung? Und behalf of the mademoiselle und mein we express our deepest getakk. Blah, blah, blah, blah... Blah, blah, blah, blah... Come on. - Report back to the captain. - There's a party! Did you forget we're here on a raid? - Your majesty, can I attend the party - You're going back. - And this is... fandango junior? - Yeah! Of course you can come. Come on, I'll show you something fun. I'll show you my treasure chamber. You see, in lama rama we've got plenty of gold, jewels, pearls and diamonds. But that's not the fun bit, far from it. That's the door we must open tonight. I get so mixed up with all these security codes. To the wig chamber, to the crocodile pit... I'm not even allowed to write them down, even though I'm king. Please turn around. Right... you too. Just checking. Six... Four... Then it's three and five make eight... And three and four make... Seven. There. Now you can turn around. Just a moment. Fun, isn't it? A king bird. Come on. Look at this. You take that, and... - Fun, isn't it? - That's the king's Pearl. This is exciting. Where did I put that again? That's right, there! This is one of my most precious treasures. My father, king Ravi, gave it to me when he told me I'd succeed him. I was just 11, and he said: "This is our most precious treasure." Do you want to open it? To see what's inside? Be very careful. Funny. Tricked you. Sorry, I'll pull myself together. I'll get serious. Please be seated over there, and I'll tell you about the riches of lama rama. No...! Surprise! I think that's so funny. Isn't that good? This is the greatest of all treasures a whoopee cushion? Er, a fart pillow... A wind bag, a fart cushion... Why? No, no, no, laughter. Laughter is the most precious treasure. You can have all the jewels and gold in the world, but without laughter you have nothing. Then, not only are you poor, you are also extremely... boring. - Isn't that right, dear brother? - Laughter, your majesty. Dear friends, tonight we'll hold a great party. To celebrate laughter! Torch! Row! Now you try to be king. Put that on. If you face life smiling you'll never lose if you're happy, you can keep away from the blues the night may be long but you can't go wrong if you can just laugh and sing this song one, two, three, four! Don't be shy let yourself go break all the rules and put on your own show if you have fun, then life won't be the same keep the laughs coming life is just a game This is great! Don't be shy let yourself go break all the rules and put on your own show if you have fun, then life won't be the same keep the laughs coming life is just a game don't be shy let yourself go break all the rules and put on your own show if you have fun, then life won't be the same keep the laughs coming life is just a... Stop! Do you know what you are? A shame to your nation. You make us into jesters in front of our guests with your foolish prank and all this talk about laughter being the greatest treasure. It's nonsense. The greatest treasure is gold and precious stones. And we have loads and loads. We could have expanded our borders and conquered. But our king wastes it all on... Bunk and baloney and nonsense. My dear, dear, angry brother... As long as it's I, king Rufus, who sits on the throne, lama rama will be a land of smiles and laughter. And you, dear brother, are free to go wherever you want, to seek the happiness you desire. Wherever you want. Very well. That's how it will be. I will be back before you know it, brother. Your majesty... I think we should retire to... our vessel now. No. You are my dear guests and shall obviously stay here at the palace. Ensure that our guests find their room and that they're safe. I'm afraid this party's over. Entschuldigung, fraulein, but we don't need any protection. - What are we going to do now? - I don't know. Have you seen the guards out there? They're armed to the teeth. The only thing we have is a fruit knife. I know how to get hold of that key. How? By making yourself invisible and sneaking past the guards? I wasn't planning to go that way. That's a great idea, pinky. It might even work. We'll tie the sheets together and hoist you down. Good idea, Rosa. But be careful, pinky. It's a long way down. Stop, stop. Ok... A bit more. Look at this. Search the ship. Quick, quick, quick, come on. We'll hide down here. Then we'll wait for pasty face to load all the treasures on board the ship. - All the treasures. - Then we'll strike. Then we'll strike. Just what I thought. Shut up, Conrad! Come on. Get down there. I'll keep watch up here. - We'll hide here, then we'll strike. - Shut up, Conrad. Get down there. - Hi, guys! - Stop that girl! That little bitch! - Open the bars! - Come back, or I'll flay you alive! Hello? Is there anybody here? Hello? Hi. Who are you? I'm no less than prince badal, who is honouring you with his presence, and... What? - Is this a pirate ship? - No... Conrad... What was that? What sort of gang is this? They're pirates. They came to Rob lama rama, and I stopped them. No, no, no, we're not pirates. We're honest merchants. This is captain sabertooth's ship. - He's after the king's Pearl. - Captain sabertooth... He's in lama rama even as we speak, to plunder all your treasures. Not so fast, my dear. - Maybe... - Hush! - Where's longfinger? - Locked in the guestroom with Rosa. Look what I found. There are loads of treasures there, more than we can carry. You surprise me, boy. One of these days you might make a fine pirate. To the treasure trove. I would dearly like to usurp that useless brother of mine, king Rufus. I could do with some scallywags to assist me. And what would these scallywags... Whom you would wish that we were... Yeah, what would be in it for them? King Rufus' famous Pearl, perhaps? The Pearl...! - What do you want us to do? - Kidnap king Rufus. Put him here on captain sabertooth's ship. I'll take care of the rest. - I want one more thing. - What? Captain sabertooth's head on a plate. With a ball and chain, if need be. Hush. There are two guards outside the room where longfinger is as well. Get that on. - Have you ever had your fortune read? - No. Shall I show you? Give me your hand. I caught him heading for the treasure trove. What... Look at this. I can see that you'll be held prisoner in a room and meet a tall, handsome pirate, who'll be the love of... It was the sprog who managed to find the key. - Good work, pinky. - Benjamin, get your rags on. Badal...? What are you doing here? And who are all these strangers? Your reign has come to an end. Take him to sabertooth's ship and hide him. What do we do now? Meow. Put these things in the jungle. To make the guards think he's been eaten by crocodiles. I'll take care of captain sabertooth. Thank you. King Rufus has fled through the secret tunnel. - And hidden in the jungle. - Why? The deadly dangerous captain sabertooth has broken in with his men and they are trying to steal our treasures. You must do your job. Arrest the pirates. Six... One and three make four... Three and five make eight... Gold... Come on, boy. Three and four... seven! The king's Pearl... So it really does exist. The lama rama treasure... At long last it's mine! Time is running out if we're going to get all this out, captain. I'm getting a bad feeling about this. Can't we just leave the place? Captain? Captain? We have to get out of here. So that's what the king of the seven seas looks like. And who are you, you cabbage head? How did you know that we're here? - I met an old acquaintance of yours. - Who? I'm not telling. But he was very... brave. He had got hold of a map, and got help from a boy on your crew to read it. Impossible. There are no traitors on board the dark lady. Yes. Or what do you say, boy? Spit it out! You toadstool! Look at your captain! Have you betrayed us? You traitor! You betrayer! You have sailed on your last raid with the dark lady. That applies to you too, captain sabertooth. Take them to the dungeon. Pinky! Raven! Pinky? You swam. Prisoners? Have they all been put in the dungeon yes. It's all my fault. I've let captain sabertooth down. We didn't manage to find king Rufus yet, but we caught these pirates. - Where did you find this? - In the jungle, by the river. Eaten him? The crocodiles... The crocodiles... What are we going to do with these pirates, your... highness? - Set them free. - What? They're honest merchants, held prisoner by sabertooth. - They don't seem very honest... - Hush! Raven, wake up! Raven... Longfinger! - Is that pinky and raven? - Is that traitor... That useless sprog trying to make off with the dark lady? - What are they up to? - This is mutiny! - The helm over hard, raven! - It's not that easy. He's preparing the cannons. Move! Excuse me, captain. Look! Hold her steady! Back! He did it. Pirates! We know that we're pirates. - They're firing at the beach! - Then stop them. Forward march! You are renowned and feared as captain sabertooth's men. To battle. Longfinger! The stairs! - They're going to smash the ship! - We have to wait for sabertooth! - We're going to die, pinky! - I refuse to give up. When we're back in abra harbour, would you join me for dinner? You'd better ask the captain first. Should he join us? To hold your hand? - Is that a yes or a no? Ladies first. - Be my guest. See you down there. No eating on the job, boys. - Bjarn the brave! - Pasty face. The only true king of the seven seas is captain sabertooth... You stinky stockfish! I thought you, the "king of the seven seas", were a master swordsman. You're quite right. I haven't even started yet. - I'm not done with you yet! - Stop nagging, you hog roast. Frida! My back! Frida! My back! Stretch me! Captain! - Where did they all come from? - Let's get out of here. Longfinger! - Captain! - Wally! Wimp! - Hep! - All hands on deck! There you go! Now we've got him! It's the crocodiles for pasty face! My dear brother... it wasn't me. These terrible people made me do it. I'm not king badal, you're king Rufus. I'm badal! I'm king badal! The gentle, kind king. Captain sabertooth. Be thankful these children found me and set me free. Or you'd have been lingering in lama rama's darkest dungeon forever, see? That rhymed. To show you my gratitude for setting free and saving me from these crooks I will let you choose one thing to bring home with you. Your majesty... I'd like the king's Pearl. The king's Pearl? Well, a promise is a promise. Where's the key? Oh, you've got it. Just a moment. On one condition... you can't open it until you get home. Understood? Set captain sabertooth and his men free and let them take the king's Pearl. And get me a better headpiece than this boring thing! Captain sabertooth... The king's Pearl is for you. Of course it is. Were you thinking of keeping it to yourself? Longfinger! Make ready the ship before that clown changes his mind. Captain... You heard the captain. Get a move on, you slackers! - Yes, please. - What? - That dinner invitation. - What? Oh yes, that's nice of... - You're welcome. - This one's so funny. My favourite! Captain sabertooth! You wretched pasty face! I'll get the better of you, I swear! Sooner or later! You... Tell me what you know about Morgan. Why should 1? Because king Rufus is planning to feed you to the crocodiles. The crocodiles... If you tell me about Morgan, I promise I'll make the king change his mind. A long time ago I sailed on the same ship as your father. A few years ago I met him in a drinking hole in the marmalades. He wanted to know the best sailing routes north. North? Where was he heading then? He wanted to set course for the northern lights. The coast of Norway. No one's seen him since. Did he say anything about me? Or something? He said that he'd abandoned his son and was sorry about it. That he couldn't return. Why couldn't he return? I have no idea. Remember what you promised me, pinky. Pinky! Pinky... Have a word with Rufus. I can understand that he wants to throw these crooks to the crocodiles. But I'm his kind and loving brother. I don't want to be eaten by crocodile. Relax, it was just something I said to get bjorn the brave to talk. So you would throw us to the crocodiles? Frida... Give him a good stretch. Captain sabertooth! When will the ordeal by fire take place? There will be no ordeal by fire. I have already chosen my deckhand. And his name is... Pinky! Now, let's open the king's Pearl! This is one of the most famous treasures in the world. And the most prized possession of king Rufus of lama rama. At long last it's mine! Pinky! Unlock the king's Pearl before the excitement makes me croak! That useless clown of a king. So this is where monkey 1 and 2 are. Do you think Morgan's alive? You were best friends. Wouldn't you like to talk to him once more? Pinky, today you have shown yourself to be a proper pirate. Why don't you celebrate that instead of sitting here dreaming? Ok? I will find him. Even if I have to travel to the ends of the earth. Subtitles: Tone sutterud B BP
