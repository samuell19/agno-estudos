One day soon... Maybe even tomorrow... An earthquake 30 kilometers under Suruga Bay in Shizuoka Prefecture. Two hours later... Numazu, Shizuoka Hey! Hey! Are you okay? You're all right? Yes. THE SINKING OF JAPAN Original Novel by: Sakyo Komatsu Executive Producer: Kunikalsu Kondo Executive Producer: Kazuya Hamana Producer: Toshiaki Nakazawa Screenplay: Masato Kato Music: Taro Iwadai Starring: Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, Kou Shibasaki Mitsuhiro Oikawa Mayuko Fukuda, Hideko Yoshida, Akira Emoto Jun Kunimura Special Guest Star: Kouji lshizaka Also Starring: Etsushi Toyokawa Mao Daichi Supervisor of Visual Effects: Katsuro Onoue Director of Special Effects: Makoto Kamiya Directed by: Shinji Higuchi These images, based on our research, show the end of the Japanese islands. It is clear that in the near future, Japan will sink. The large earthquake the other day in Suruga Bay was one such sign. The probability is 50% within 30 years... and 80% within 50 years. Due to mantle convection, the Pacific Ocean plate below the Japan Sea... is accumulating at the border of the upper and lower mantles. The accumulated plate is known as a megalith. Once it exceeds a certain size, it collapses. This phenomenon is called 'megalith collapse. ' This massive event is starting to occur right under Japan. The Japanese archipelago, located on the edge of the plate... will be pulled into the ocean by changes in the earth's crust. Accompanied by catastrophic earthquakes and eruptions... Japan will sink. The only positive thing is that we can predict this decades in advance. Unfortunately, however, there is no hope for Japan. Off Kinkazan, Miyagi Prefecture Center for Ocean Development Deep Submersible 'Wadatsumi 6500' This is Wadatsumi 6500. In Japan Trench, depth 5830 meters. Dropping ballast. Water temperature 1. 2, salinity 36. 4. Trim is good. 120 meters to target. What's that? That's new to me... That's a lot of gas. What's happening? The camera! What the hell?! The how's damaged. Take her up. Full speed. Roger. Drop ballast. Wait... 4.5... 3. 2... Drop! You did it again! Thanks. Yokosuka, Kanagawa Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology 3. 2... drop ballast... Surface... It's your mother. Were you okay in that earthquake? At least call and let me know if you're all right. Right there. If you would. Onodera! You've got a visitor. I'm surprised you found me. Here. I fixed it. Thank you. I'm sorry! I had a few problems... Uh, thanks. Wow! What's this ship? A deep-driller. 210 meters long, with a 121-meter tower. It can put a pipe down 4,000 meters... and drill 7,000 meters into the sea-bed. It can reach the mantle... for tectonic research, or environmental change... Too fast? I always hated maths and science... SOT“!- Can you climb to the top? Yes. I'd love to do that! Sorry? My grandpa was a fireman. Head of the citizens' fire brigade. At the New Year's rite, he'd be up on the ladder. That was cool. Are you listening? Uh, yeah... Because of him, I came to just love high places. So you joined the rescue unit? I wished I'd been born a man like him. Yeah, but... when you rescued us... you were as cool as a man. Even cooler. Thanks. Misaki told me you were trying to save her. Misaki? The girl. Could you visit her? The earthquake killed her father. They pulled her mother out of the wreckage, but she's in a coma. The girl's depressed... but she wants to talk to you. Shinagawa, Tokyo Hyottoko Is it ready yet? No! We're waiting! Not yell Beer for you? 'Scuse me. There! Not quite. It looks OK now. Yeah, OK. I'm putting the sake here. Great! OK? Give her a clean one! I don't need advice from you! Aw, shuddup! Turn off the gas! Another earthquake! Yasu! What's going on? Don't ask me! Why not? You work for the city taking my taxes! Since when do you pay taxes? What's City Hall got to do with earthquakes? It's okay. You'll be fine. I'm thinking of creating a Ministry of Disaster Management. Make it an additional portfolio. For whom? You, Minister. Along with your science portfolio. Wait, Prime Minister... The others have no sense of crisis. They say we've still got 30 years. But... In the face of this crisis, we should abandon the weak. Postpone evacuation of citizens over 60. Many in the party think that. Ms Takamori... what do you think... is most important now? I think it's 'head. ' 'Heart'? Or at least the heartfelt wish to save every single person we can. Am I being impractical? No, I don't think so. Then take the portfolio. You have the heart for it. Off Cape Ashizuri, Kochi Prefecture Deep-Sea Drilling Vessel 'Chikyu' A team under Dr. Yusuke Tadokoro of the Earthquake Research Institute... begins research into earthquake prediction. Investigations with this drill-ship... examine changes in mantle flow in the 'Japan Trench'... which runs parallel to Japan in the Pacific Ocean. A segmented pipe string is lowered straight down from the vessel... to depths of up to 4,000 meters. Blowout Preventer Secured to the sea floor, it can drill 1,000 meters into the earth's crust. Fire! Induced-tremor research. Crust analysis through propagation of ground waves. Undersea Mountain Range, Kagoshima. Depth 3,803 meters. Take a sample. Roger. Cook Islands, South Pacific Mangaia Island We simulated the lower mantle. 100 gigapascals at 3,000 degrees. It was a shock, I'll tell you. Where did you get this? In the South Pacific, on the Cook Islands. What did you find? Like you said. It's 20 million years old. About the time Japan split off from Eurasia. The bits of megalith that fell into the mantle then... came up in the Cook Islands. The ohm readings have changed over the past six months. The magma's moving strangely. You've been sniffing around. Have you hit on anything? The mantle's moving strangely down in the Cook Islands. From ground waves at Daisetsuzan, Tanzawa, and the northern Alps... I've found unusual activity in the earth's crust. I see... If you're right... something big is about to happen. Data analysis predicts time of geological event. Doctor... Doctor? The results should be up soon. Be right back. Hey! What the hell?! What is this?! Hey! No! No! No! Will you stop wasting our time and get to the point! Megalith collapse is not the only problem we face. Another change is taking place, which spells the end for Japan. Delamination. 'Delamination'? Layers of the crust peel off. These are... bacteria from the mantle boundary. These bacteria digest organic material to produce methane gas. They flourish between the mantle and the plate... and produce huge amounts. This methane liquefies and works as a lubricant. That speeds up the plate as the megalith pulls on it. Combined with the phenomenon called 'delamination'... it means... Japan will sink much faster than the Americans say. If your hypothesis is correct... when will Japan sink? This simulation takes 302 seconds. That converts... to 338. 54 days. Not even a year? This should receive urgent consideration. Nonsense! Prime Minister, this is unmitigated foolishness. Tadokoro... this is all 'hunch' and imagination, isn't it? 'Objectivity and repeatability. ' ls that not what science is? Repeatability? Are you stupid? Tadokoro! Show more respect. Get lost, flunkey. What?! Listen up! The fracture will start up in south Hokkaido. And the Izumi fault down in Kyushu. Mt. Aso will blow. Then the Median Tectonic Line right across the middle of the country. South of that will sink. The energy will fracture every active fault zone in the country. On the main island here... once the Fossa Magma formation splits, it'll be all over. Fuji will blow, and Japan... Will sink, just like that. To study these changes, Prime Minister Yamamoto... will form the 'D1 Team.' We don't even have a year. It's no time for 'studies. ' Have it your way. You are free not to participate. However, all your very latest in research equipment... will be transferred to D1. Get serious! I've got a million things to do with these ships! Stop screaming like some kid who's had a toy taken away. Why won't you ever grow up? Fighting in front of the Prime Minister! We split up 20 years ago. Stop acting like a wife. You can stay out if you like. But D1 will be doing the research. Maybe instead you should be thinking of how to get people out! Tokyo Fire Department, 8th District Attention! Hyper-Rescue Unit Brake! Land! Next! Rappelling Practice Begin! Releasing! Brake! Ready! Right! Brake! Brake! Next! Brake, check! Ready! Carabiner: Locked! Rope: Clear! Fall point Begin! Brake! Brake! Bye-bye. What happened? I had a bit of a fall. I'll be off work for a while... so now we can play! Come on! It's love. Huh? My work. I really love it. Oh. The truth... The truth is... I'm like Misaki. I was in the Kobe Earthquake. My parents got killed. I was left alone. That's how I came here. I was trapped, it was pitch-dark, and I was scared. The next day, someone from the Rescue Unit saved me. So... I always thought I'd become someone who could rescue... a girl like me. Now, with all these quakes... when I need to be ready... this happens! There's no rush. I've liked the ocean ever since I was a kid. The deep ocean. I was always reading books about it. Deep-sea fish excited me. Weird, huh? Down deep there are creatures, unchanged in millions of years. Oh, sorry... I started talking about science again. It's okay. Tell me more. When I'm at the bottom... it's like the planet's holding me, like, I don't know... I feel safe. Maybe like you're in your mother's womb? Yeah. Like that. What? If you'd been my science teacher, I'm sure I would've liked science. My research team is dissolved as of today. You've put up with all my nonsense, and you're the world's best pilots. You'll find other jobs. But you'd better get out of this country right away. However, the fact that Japan will sink in less than a year is top-secret. Not a word to anyone. The Wadatsumi 2000, the first Japanese submarine... able to reach 2,000 meters. Tokyo International Airport Haneda These are the essentials of the D2 foreign evacuation plan. I wonder how many China will be willing to take... Rain What do you think? It's my grand-daughter's name. She's three tomorrow. My daughter likes this song 'Layla', but it's too 'pretty' a name. I said to give the poor kid a break, but she just wouldn't listen. I want Reira to be happy. I've had people in different fields... give me their opinions on the future of Japan. Their visions of what we should do, assuming that with our economy gone... America and the other countries are bound to abandon us. One idea surprised me. An unusual idea, maybe... Unusual in normal terms, anyway... but one which several people in different fields had. And that was... the idea that we should do nothing. Together with our loved ones, we should die with the land. An idea like that... might be one only the Japanese would think of. But... I'm not speaking as Prime Minister. This is just my personal opinion. To tell the truth... I like that idea best. Prime Minister, it's time. All right. I know. It wouldn't be acceptable. And... before Reira is 'Japanese'... she is human. We're human before anything else! We all have the right to live... and to hope. It's going to be hard, but look after things while I'm away. Daisetsuzan Range, Hokkaido Mts. Tokachi and Furano erupt. All right. Just a minute. We've got earthquakes in southern Hokkaido. Contact the Prime Minister. But he'll be over Kyushu... Ml. Aso Official charter flight. City of Kumamoto Mt. Aso, in Kumamoto Prefecture, erupted at 1:50 pm today. The largest eruption ever recorded... has reportedly obliterated the entire Aso Caldera zone. Prime Minister Yamamoto, en route for China... is also reported missing over the island of Kyushu. General Disaster Standing Order 46 The Air Self-Defense Force scrambles RF-4EJ reconnaissance Phantoms. Mts. Unzen, Myoken, Kuninfi erupted. Sakurajima Island, Kagoshima Prefecture Erupted. Earthquakes on Shikoku and around Osaka at 3:52 pm. Epicenter: Yoshino River, Shikoku! The Median Line... Contact with Kochi lost. Intermittent tremors in the north of the main island. Minister, our lines to Kyushu are down. I invoke the Disaster Measures Law. Call out the Self-Defense Forces. Alert the Chiefs of Staff. Earthquakes, Eruptions Without End Kumamoto City Obliterated Faults Crack Open Massive Earthquakes Continue In Northeast The register's down! Wait! Hold still while the Johan Expressway... is backed up 80 kilometers north from Tokyo. All domestic flights... have been suspended due to risk of earthquake. State Of Emergency Declared Stocks Plummet ATM Closed Five years? You mean lie to the public? If I don't lie... this panic will destroy the country before it sinks. If you don't like lying... then speed up our talks with other countries. You're interim Prime Minister. That's your job. Go to China and the U.S. Let the Foreign Ministry do that. I don't want to go like Mr Yamamoto. It's my duty to protect the public. It is now clear... the Japanese archipelago will sink within five years. The government... with its experience of past disasters... has prepared a coordinated response... to this eventuality. All Japanese citizens will be evacuated to foreign countries. You will be informed in due time of which countries will accept you. Even now, arrangements with those nations are being made. All that remains to be decided is which families... will go to which countries. You will be informed as to where you are to assemble... Reiko, is this OK? No, this way... Like that. There. Can you believe this?! Japan's going to sink in five years! Where do you think they're going to send us? It's Las Vegas or Monaco for me! What?! You don't have any money. You shut up. I'm a gambler. I've got money! You only ever play pachinko! Hey, Yasu! as no rail lines can be used. Turning to airlines... Hokkaido Kyushu Shikoku Hiroshima New Tokyo International Airport, Narita What are the countries saying? They're reluctant to accept any more Japanese. Tell our ambassadors to push harder! I know that. And find us ships. Right. Passenger ships, freighters, tankers, I don't care. All the big ships you can find! Kyoto Bring that. To America. Those ships carrying national treasures could be carrying people. Shouldn't we be thinking of that? Tell me about it. I'm going to the States. Just like you wanted. Bribing America with art treasures... ls that the Prime Minister's job? Takamori, watch your mouth! I'm talking about lives! Look, here's the situation. The red line is the 33.4 million we've evacuated. The blue line is the 36. 35 million dead. And these... are the projections. Some reports predict as many as 80 million dead. So... how many people outside will take isn't a problem. They'll be dead anyway. Dead Missing Japan... Tell me how we save its people. Tadokoro Laboratory A thousand... A hundred... No... even one life more. I want to save the people who are left here. Let this newspaper be the plate that's pulling Japan into that trench. Pull on it. Go on. Pull hard. That's how to save Japan from sinking. As the plate is pulled... it bends, and cracks start to appear. We drill shafts deep into the crust, and fill them... with explosive. We set hundreds of them to blow in sequence. And the plate... fractures. Is there an explosive powerful enough to do that? 'N2.' It's still experimental... but down in those shafts, it'll be like a nuclear bomb. If we can slow down the Pacific plate, we can save more people. If we're lucky, we can also limit how much of Japan sinks. But we'd need just about every drill ship in the world. Getting all those ships will be almost impossible. We interrupt this program... violent tremors... Call this number for emergency information... powerful earthquakes in the center of the country... Dead Missing Injured Buildings Destroyed evacuate to higher ground. Yokohama Harbor Kobe Harbor God dag. God dag. We've made friends, haven't we? Remember Mr. Weis in Norway? From the North Sea... Yeah. He's got a cottage. My wife and son are there. An English research team's made me an offer. Want to come? Me? They'll take us both. Ma... I'm staying. Why? Dr Tadokoro's starting something, trying to save Japan. I want to help. Why? My son. To take him to the coast, where I used to go when I was a kid. I want to teach him about the ocean. Stupid, huh? Please move to your designated assembly point. Misaki, I... What's wrong? The hospital your mother's in just phoned! Your mother! She's woken up! Mom! Pressure 50. Dopamine, 20 gamma. Bradykinin! Atropine! Mom? Mom? Mom! Here. Your daughter's here. Misaki? I'm so glad! What? What? Stay... alive. Arrest! Excuse me... Mrs. Kuraki! Hold on! Mrs. Kuraki! Your daughter's here! Mrs. Kuraki! She suddenly woke up. All I can say is... it was a miracle. I guess it was pure desire to see her daughter again. Your mother... she told you. "Stay alive," she said, didn't she? Misaki... Off the Boso Peninsula America... Norway, France... Even from China! I'm amazed how fast you got them. Is this really all right? What? You're risking what it's taken you more than 20 years to get. Japan's sinking. My job's the last thing I'm worried about. Thanks. Sorry? Hakodate Gate 1 will be opened, and the area will flood. Granny! Why do we have to go?! Come on! I like it here! Coming through! Reiko! I promise it won't be long. I'll see you soon. Let's go. Tokyo Bay has passed the danger level. The seafront breakwaters could fail at any time. Water Gates 6 and 1 will thus be opened tomorrow at 6 am. And this area will flood. Please leave the area. Um... I've got an offer to go and work in England. Oh? When are you going? I'm not sure. Before all the airports are closed. Oh. Come with me. I want you to come with me. Just like that? They got me tickets for you and Misaki, too. You, me and Misaki. I want us to be together. I have to go back to the rescue squad. There's a lot of kids like Misaki still waiting for help. I want to save them, if it's the last thing I do. But Japan's going to sink. I know how you feel, but there's no time. If we don't get out now, we'll be abandoned here. They say five years, but... What? Nothing. Anyway, I really want to save you and Misaki. And leave Aunt Tamae and the rest? I don't want to. But brave words won't help. It's not just words! I... I can't be happy if they're not. Iruma Air Base Air Self-Defense Force Kyushu Nanao, lshikawa Neither North nor South Korea will allow private vessels to land. All aboard unauthorized vessels will be treated as illegal immigrants. Aizu Region Fukushima Prefecture This area remains undamaged. Warnings have also been issued for the Aizu region. It is to be evacuated by the 15th. This is our yeast. With this, you can brew our sake anywhere in the world. All the best. Let's go. You take care! I'm sorry. I didn't follow Dad into the business, so now it's all on your shoulders. If you'd taken it over, we'd have gone broke years ago. What's this new job, then? Studying ancient forms of sea life. The ocean's like a time machine. The deeper you go, the further back in time you get. Oh? If only you could go deep enough to bring your father back... You miss him? Of course! You two were still small... and it was busy and it was hard... but those were the days I enjoyed most. Do you remember when those fledglings fell out of that swallows' nest? Yeah. Then you fell going up the ladder to help them... What a day that was! It's still there... It's been empty for two or three years now. I've decided I'm going to stay here. What'?! This place is going to sink! All my family memories are scattered through this brewery. Of your father, too. The place is steeped in them. I want to be with your father until the very end. That's crazy. What? Some things mean more than life. Like loving someone. Chofu Airport, Tokyo Careful! Owl That hurts! Stop it! This way, Minister. All right? Don't push! Get back! Get back! Places willing to accept the Japanese, like America, China, and the EU... are struggling to cope with the flood of refugees. However, many in these nations are concerned over the influx. Even our multinationals' stocks are going through the floor! It seems America's started selling yen and our bonds. They promised us a year! We've been cut loose, haven't we? Evacuation Committee reporting. Komatsu and Hiroshima report volcanic ash over danger levels. And? No more flights will be possible in that region. Maritime Self-Defense Force Transport Vessel 'Ohsumi' LCAC Hovercraft Transports Temporary Evacuation Center Hino, Tokyo Toshio! Toshio! Misaki, I... Mr Onodera! Look! Cabbages! Cabbages? And tomatoes! Cabbage! Great! Here goes! This is good! Great, huh? Here. Mr Onodera's father made this. Savor it. It's great! Thank you. Bu! you're lucky. You're going to England. We“... It looks like we're not going anywhere. Why not? Well, they got us all together... to wait our turn for a plane... but now they're moving us to higher ground, they say. They're abandoning us. So you're just going to go off and die, then? If the whole place erupts, does it matter where we are? We'll cook monja pancakes on the lava! Great ideal Reiko told me. So you asked her to go with you... Yes. Thank you. But she said no. She was real happy. She likes you a lot. But men and women... it's complicated. Those guys gulp this stuff down like it was cheap sake. That'll do. Is this you? Where? Yes! Look how young I am! The girl beside me... is my younger sister, Reiko's mother. And that's your father? The fireman... Reiko told you that? Yes. It's not true. Reiko never knew him. He was dead when she was born. When Reiko came to us from Kobe... she was a lot like Misaki now. The kids teased her at school... So I told her to tell them, "My grandpa was a fireman!" That way the other kids would leave her alone. It all started with a lie I told. Then before I knew it... she'd turned him into a genuine hero. D1 reports... multi-centered earthquakes in Shizuoka, Nagano, and Niigatal Magnitude 7... 1. 4... still rising! Tokyo, scale 6! It's coming! Switching to generator. OK? This is Fuji Observation Post. Tremors increasing! Eruption imminent. It's happening too fast for us. The Fossa Magma's shifting. That's the country's backbone. If Mt. Fuji blows, it'll tear the main island in two... and we'll start sinking. Minato and Chiyoda wards are sinking faster. We're not safe here. Have the Imperial Household Agency get the Emperor out. We'll move to our back-up facility. Osaka “an Kyoto Maw!' Uozu, Toyama Fukuoka Nagano Sendai OK? I'm tired. Yeah... How far do we have to climb? My shoulders! Keep going. Yep. Are you all right? Excuse me... Excuse me... Excuse me... JOIDES Resolution reports Drill Line 3 complete. Explosives in place? It's taking time to repair Pits 18 to 26 after yesterday's quake. We don't have time! Hurry them up. This is Operations Control. Feed repair status to our monitors. How's the 6500? Yuki here. Ready to dive. Dr Tadokoro. It's me. The shafts and the explosives are all in place. Now all we have to do is put the N2 igniter in place. Evacuate the post! Get everyone out! Without a miracle... Mt. Fuji's going to blow sky-high. Speed's up from 1.6 to 2 knots. Yuki, are you OK? The current's getting faster. I can handle this speed. I'll finish this and be right back up. This is Wadatsumi 6500. Depth 3,750 meters. I'm at ignition point. There's a lot of debris spewing up out of the trench. Be careful. Roger. Tidal current gaining strength! Water density 1.053! A density current! Hey! Yuki! The igniter's broken free. That's all we've got. Can you reach it? I see it, 50 meters away. Moving to recover. Yuki? Do you read me? Doctor? Propulsion system down! Yuki Hey! Yuki! Yuki left these. Give them to his family. I can't give them his ashes. I sent him into that current. It's my fault. So what about your plan? It sank with Yuki. It's all over. And Japan? What about the people still here? Just a little bit longer. Tera-Chan... It's not far. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going, everybody! It's just past that next rise! Keep going! What happened?! The damn road's cracked! What's wrong? It won'! move. Here we go... Heave! Thank you! Thank you. OK, now, push! Here goes! Run! Quick! Hurry! Misaki, I... Don't let go! Hang on tight! Misaki, I... Are you all right?! Misaki, I... Come on! Quick! Hurry! Central Rift Valley 'Fossa Magma' Hokkaido Kyushu Tomorrow... I leave for England. Oh. So I really wanted to see you. Thank you. All this way, just for me. Well done. I may never see you again. What do you mean, 'well done'? You always just shut me down. If you don'! like me, say so. I do like you! Of course I do! I'm glad you came. I just don't know what it is I should say! My mind... is made up. In grade school... my father... my mother... and all my friends got killed. So I made up my mind. I decided I'd never love anyone again. Then... I'd never be so sad again. But... then I fell in love with you. I don't know what to do! Sorry... Promise me something. What? I swear I'll come to England with Misaki. Wait for me until then. Sure. I'll wait. Thank you. Onodera... Make love to me. Right now I can't. Why not? We just promised, didn't we? You said you'd save Misaki and your aunt... and come to England. Then we'll be happy. I want that. I owe you an apology. My going to England is a lie. I've decided not to go. Doctor... I'll take this boat down to the ignition point. Don't be stupid. A boat this old won't make it. It only goes down 2,000 meters. Just as you risk your life for your mission... I have found a mission of my own. To help you save every life you possibly can... I will go into the sea. I've only ever done what I wanted to. Now I realize there is something I must do. If you go down there, you'll never come back. I know that. Then why? This... Give it to Yuki's family. It was only for a short time, but with you I've been happy. It'll take more than a miracle for this to work. I can't kill you, too. I won't allow it. Now... I know exactly how Yuki felt. I've got someone to protect, too. I'll bring about... a miracle. I believe... one day you and Misaki will be happy. Live... and promise me you will. I'm glad I met you. Thank you. Damn it! For some reason dreams never last The morning breeze steals them away Love suddenly becomes a struggle All the places words go... are all closed in. Unbreakable... is this desire. This love words can't express... I have to fight so hard... to keep it inside. I want to protect it... and not lose my way Til my heart stops beating These lives we've found... echo together beyond time And even if tears should fall... I want to be held, and forever... It's right here. There's the drill-shaft. You pick up the N2 igniter, and you drop it in. The instant you do that, the fuse lights.

Marine Self-Defense Force Transport Vessel 'Shimokita' Temporary Headquarters, Government of Japan We should put out a statement. Yes. Have Acting Prime Minister Nozaki fly back right away. No. You should make the announcement. No one but you. Observations indicate... the movement of tectonic plates dragging our nation under the sea... is coming to an end. This unprecedented disaster has taken many, many lives. With all our heads we pray for those whose lives have been lost... and for all those bereaved. We, the people of Japan... must stand the test of this ordeal, and unite in heart and soul... in joining to rebuild Japan. Those evacuated abroad... will soon be able... to return home. Finally... to save Japan from sinking into the sea... two submarine pilots have given their lives. Toshio Onodera... Talsuya Yuki... To both... we give our deepest expressions of thanks... and of sorrow. Misaki, I... Reiko! Um... Reiko... thank you! Reiko! Reiko Abe, Tokyo Hyper-Rescue Squad. We're here for you! Reiko! Aunt Tamae!
