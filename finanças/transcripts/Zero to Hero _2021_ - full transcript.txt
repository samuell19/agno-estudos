This is it. 2008 Paralympic Men's 200 m T36 final is underway at the Beijing National Stadium in front of more than 90,000 spectators, and I'm not seeing any empty seats. Which is rare, as the Paralympic Games have never witnessed a full house of spectators in any events. Rumor has it that Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau is known to be a keen supporter of one of today's runner, So Wa Wai which may be the reason why this event has attracted a mass of spectators. Andy Lau's fans? It's time now, Wonder Boy. You got this. This is the fourth consecutive time So Wa Wai has competed in the Paralympic Games since 1996, winning numerous gold medals. However, at age 27, he's considered to be an aging athlete to compete at the international arena. This may be his last run to glory, his last medal. Will we witness wonder from him again today? Men's T36 200 m finals is about to begin. Athletes, please approach the starting line. On your ma. Set. Go. Hey! Hey! You have to go up to the second floor! You have an appointment, go! Your grandson has hemolytic jaundice. Because his mother's blood type is different from his, her antibodies are causing his bilirubin level to rise, resulting in jaundice. What does that mean? It has affected his brain. The part that controls his muscles is permanently damaged. In layman's terms, he has cerebral palsy. Even if he survives, he may never be able to walk or eat on his own. All we can do for him now? is exchange transfusion. The question is whether or not you want to do it? Yes! Whatever it takes! Due to his cerebral palsy, his muscle tone are not as good as someone without his condition. His limbs, for example, his fingers are showing signs of atrophy. In terms of his lower limbs, since his muscles are very underdeveloped, based on my experience, if he isn't able to walk at this age yet, his chances of walking are very slim. And I'm afraid we've discovered another complication, His hearing is in 10 to 20 percent, hence his difficulties with communication. He needs to start wearing a hearing aid. Can I have a coke, please? Sure. Huh? Uh? It's all right, I'll give it to him. Why are you giving it to him? But what about them? Here, take this. Why did she get us stop? I can't believe-- What's the hold up? Why aren't you working? Oh, apparently, Mrs. So's son lost his hearing aid. She's looking for it. Are you and your son both mentally challenged? I already agreed for you to bring him to work. But now I've got to stop operations? I have a deadline to meet. Hurry up and find it! Get back to work! Stop messing around! Wai? Wai? Wai? Wa Wai! Wai! Wai! Wai! Wai? What are you doing there? Who put you in there? You may not walk, but you can still scream, you know! What's that smile? What's so funny? What's so funny, huh? You have to walk right now, or we can just die here! Walk. Get up and walk! Get up and walk! Look at me, get up and walk, Wa Wai! Get up and walk, please! I'm always watching. I'm always watching. Come here. No one will ever treat you like an ordinary person. So just be? extraordinary. All right, good job, Wa Wai. One more step, that's it. One more time, what's your name, big boy? Shu Ah Ai. Mmm, that's "Wai". So. Wa. Wai. So Wa Wai. Show Grandpa how you walk. That's a good boy. Papa, Wa Wai is doing well. Honey, I went to see the doctor. He said Wa Wai's condition isn't hereditary. He said if we had another child, he should be fine. Yeah, but that would cost a lot. So what? When we get older, someone has to take care of Wa Wai. Quit playing around and hurry. Come on. Brother! Brother! Hello! Where did you go, little guy? Hurry up you two. I still have a lot of laundry to do, and I have to bring them to the factory. -Oh, and by the way, your homework-- -Ma? I really need to go to the toilet. Jeez, not again. Hurry up. Okay. Kin Wai. You must really love egg so much because you've got another zero. Okay, tell me. What's this word? I don't know. And this one? I don't know. It says, "Sports Association for the Physically Disabled." "Sports Association." "Track and field." "Track and field?" It's me, the God of Fortune! Mrs. Chan, the God of Fortune is here! You're gonna be rich! -God of Fortune is here! -Huh? Wow, you can write already? How smart! Nice handwriting! Okay, here's ten bucks for you, Wa Wai. Thank you, Mrs. Chan. -You're a good boy. Bye now. -Thank you so much. One, two? Hey, hey, Wa Wai, I'm supposed to tell you to come home for dinner. What are you doing over there? My Fortune Charms! We're gonna eat like Kings tonight, little brother! Oh, wow! Hey, you, who said you could sell those here? If you do, you gotta pay me first, you understand? What are you doing? Don't you move or I'll hit you. Mama, there's some bullies out here! What? Wai! Hey! Stop running, you jerk! -You'd better not let me catch you! -Wai! Can't you run any faster? -Let's go, let's go! -Come on, hurry up! Go get him! He's upstairs! Hurry, hurry! Faster, get a move on! Chase him! To the left! Wai, go faster! Run faster! -Will you stop following me? -Where did he go? -Go around him! -Over there! Where are you going? Hurry, he's up ahead! Hurry up, Wai! Don't let them catch you! Wai, keep running faster! Run faster! -Run faster, Wai! -Hey! Stop, Wai! Stop it, you jerk! Back off! Go! Go, go! -Let's get out of here. -Come on, let's go, come on. Wa Wai, are you all right? Huh? Do you feel sick? We can eat more. I'd like to register my son. Here, Wai. How old are you, young man? I'm 13. I'm afraid he's too young. ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST BE 14 YEARS OLD AND ABOVE. ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST BE? He has the right Korean age, 14. Korean? Fine. Let me put it this way. He's 13 years old. If I let him in, he'll be raising against older kids. That wouldn't be fair to him. Look at him, he's so lanky. He's probably a lot taller than most grown-ups. He's even taller than you right now. Come on, just give him a chance. Ma'am, bring him back next year. -All right, come on. There you go. -Keep the record. Goodness! Let's go! Wai! Where are you going? You're almost to get to the finish line. Just look over there. Keep running, go! Wai, they're older but they are not as tall as you. All right! On your marks. Set. Let's go, Wai. Wa Wai! You already finished the race! Wai! Wa Wai! The race is done! -Come on back, Wai! -Excuse me. -Wa Wai! Come on, son. -Hey, ma'am. -Come back! Huh? -Hey, ma'am. He's your son? Uh, yeah. I'd like to invite him to train track and field with me. I'm Coach Fong, I trained the Para-Athletics Team. Huh? Bring him on Monday at seven o'clock. Wai. You'll start training soon. Listen to Coach Fong. And if you have questions, you ask. Don't you give up easily. You hear me? Can you do it? Okay. But it's just running. How difficult could that be? Seven more to go! Don't stop running! If you can't do it, just go! You're just slowing down everybody else! Coach Fong, are you really sure about keeping this guy around? -You okay? -Let's get someone else. Are you tired? Here drink some water. You know what? If you wanna rest, go home. Keep going. I got this, go. Mrs. So, if you want me to be his coach, you have to trust me. Look, you can't be here. Also, stay off the track. You're not an athlete. Here you go. Have some water. Drink slowly. A word of advice? Don't take Coach Fong too seriously, okay? If he tells you to run ten laps, just say, "Yes, Coach!" Then run for two. And walk the rest of the way. All right. Are you part of the team too? Coach Fong is my brother. By the way, that guy over there, why is he running with a bag over his head? He's just crazy. You know what he told me, it's similar to high-altitude running. He's training as cardiovascular function. From what I heard, he used to race trains at a distance of 100 m as part of his training. And you know what, he actually beat the train. And that's why we call him Train Tung. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Will you just stop it? It's not gonna work. No. What's all that about? Pitch me, man. Only Gai can understand him. So we need him to translate what he's saying for us. All right, fine! Do what you want. Just don't blame me if you end up getting killed. Whatever, suit yourself. What does he want now? He said that there's a faster way of passing the baton, but whatever. -Hurry up. Come on. -All right, all right. Okay, I'll see you right here. Hurry up. Aah! Hey, Tung, train by yourself. Okay. Gai and Keung. Run five laps. Do one more round after a three-minute break. Sprint for the last 200 and then repeat. Then afterwards baton passing with me. -Mm. -Got it. Wa Wai, ten more laps for you. That's 20 in total. Nonstop. You know what does mean, right? Yeah. Go on. Hey! I said run, not walk. Okay, I'm all done! The lights are out, but you're not. You're not going anywhere. Not until you finish the last eight. Go on. Do you know why I chose you? You had very steady frequent strides when you race that day. I've never seen such an incredible first-timer. But I haven't seen it since. You haven't shown me that you can do it again. Wa Wai, the reason why coach is tough on you is because he's pushing you to be good enough to take his place. He took Tung, Keung, and myself to run the 400 m relay at the last Paralympics. Even with our times from practice, we could have won a medal. But then Keung and I thought we already crossed the changeover zone during the baton passing. and then we lost time. In the end, we came into fourth and didn't get a medal. It really affected Coach Fong because that was his last Paralympics. Why did Coach Fong stop running? He hurt his back really bad, plus his age. All three of us are over 30 years old. This could very well be the last year we can run too. So? we're counting on you. Are you saying that we might get a gold medal if I run fast? Who knows? At the rate you're going, maybe a silver. No way, I have to get a gold medal! Yeah, I have to get a gold medal! His record is still over by 15 seconds. Oh, that's not too bad. I think we can work with these numbers. What I'm most worried about is his balance. I mean look at him. He can't be the first or the third runner because of the curve. So that just leaves the second. And his baton passing isn't that good yet. Hurry! Oh, no, we'll be in big trouble. But why? I've always been the anchor leg! That's my final decision. Is he really that special? We're a team, Tung. It doesn't matter who crosses the finish line. Oh, it doesn't! I quit! -Hey, Tung. -Let go! Are you done overreacting? If he runs third, then we're through for sure. But if he's last then will still got a chance. You really want him to run fourth? He'd better do it under 15! You heard him. Go on. Slowly. Find your balance. Squat down lower. Don't rush it, find your balance. -Oh! -My goodness! -Aah! -Wai! You think you can do it? Wai? Why are you covering your head with this bag? Huh? Wai? Why are you crying, huh? What's wrong? Huh? Come on and tell Mama, huh? I want to? I? I want to run faster. I'm really trying my best. It's better to run than to keep crying. Let's make it under 15 seconds together! Faster! Faster! A nice and juicy hamburger. Wa Wai, from now on you have to eat more beef. You need to build more muscles, so one day you'll be strong enough to carry even two Gills. Kin Wai, this one's for you. What? Yours has cheese on it. Wa Wai doesn't have any. Hey, look on the step. Wait for me. Look, Ma! Go! Eggs for you, Papa. Eggs for you, Mama. And eggs for you, big brother. Hand! Hey! Young man. Excuse me, for a second. This is my usual spot. What's up? Train Tung didn't show up again today, huh? It's his decision if he wants to run with us or not. But there's only three of us, are you gonna run again? You think you can give him a call? Are you crazy? He doesn't have any problem with Keung. You call him. Come on, Gai, why me? You know how he is! Never mind, let him be. Uh? I'm not allowed inside. But you are, you just refused to. Well, there are a lot of mosquitoes here. They're so annoying. Hey, did you know that you have a fan? That silly boy Wa Wai wears a plastic bag over his head like you. I'm using this the wrong way. I used them for carrying stuff. Want some? It's good. Let's share, okay? One day, that boy came crying and crying. And then he said, "I wish I could run as fast as him." It must be cool? to be admired. Run! Run! I told you to run, you idiot! Run! Run! Get your butt out there and run! Run! Grab it! Run! Hurry up! Faster! Faster! Run faster and go! Go faster! Faster! Run! Keep running! 14.57! You did it! Yeah! Do your best, my boy. I told all our relatives to watch the live broadcast and cheer you on. But there's no live broadcast of the Paralympics in Hong Kong. Oh, really? It's not right when Lee Lai Shan won an Olympic gold, I saw it on television. How can the Paralympics compare? We only get less than a hundred thousand and that's it for bringing home a medal. You know how much Lee Lai Shan got for her gold? She got a million from the government. But why the difference? Equal pay for equal work does not exist. I'll check us in. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. -Let's go. -This way, please. Wa Wai? Mama, can you hear me? Mama? Yes, I can hear you. I can hear you. I can only talk for five minutes. Huh? Oh, all right. Then I'll talk really fast. You flew for 12 hours, are you tired? Did you get some sleep? Eat lots of beef, US beef is really good for you. Yeah, there's a lot of beef here. They have steaks and burgers. Everything is free. Well, that's great. Stuff yourself then. You will need the energy for running. But I don't wanna run anymore. You're not here. And I'm all alone. You're not alone, you hear me? Mama is always watching you. How is that? Are you gonna fly over here? Hey, when you start running, imagine Mama watching you at the finish line. It's kinda like what they say at the beginning, "Look at Ma, set go!" Huh? "Look at your ma, set go!" Oh. It's not "look at your ma." It's "on your mark." By the way, where's Papa and little brother? Well, they're both sleeping soundly like little pigs. Let me listen. Just a second. Hang on. Men's 4x100 m T36 to 38 relay is about to begin. Athletes, please approach the starting line. Final call for the men's T36 to 38 4x100 m relay. Athletes? How is it? It's not working, there's no signal! How about now? No, nothing! Move it a bit more. There's no signal! How about now? No signal! It's working! Don't move! Oh, look, there he is. Men's 4x100 m T36 to 38 relay is about to begin. Athletes, please? I need to pee, Mama. Just hold it in. The race is gonna start. Final call for the men's T36 to 38 4x100 m relay. Athletes, line up behind the starting line. All personnel should clear the tracks. Keung! Keung! Keung! Don't be scared! You've got this, so don't be afraid. -Don't give in to fear! -Sir, you've got to get off immediately. -Listen to me, I know you can do this! -Come on! Come on! -Come with us, sir. -This is our last race. Win this medal for us, Keung. Do you hear me? -You can do this! -Come on. I know you can! Yes! I can do it! Yes! Yes! Men's T36 to 38 4x100 m relay. On your mark, set? Gai! Gai! Faster. Must go fast. Start running! Hand! Go faster! Head for the finish line! Head for the finish line! Hong Kong is catching up and closing the gap between Japan and the United States with Great Britain right on their tails. We're into the last 20 m. Everyone is chasing hard. This is very tight. It's just at the line! Japan, United States, and Hong Kong. I believe we'll have to wait for the replay to know who's taking home the gold medal. This shouldn't take long. All runners are looking at the big screen. It's Hong Kong! The time, 50.46. Men's T36 to 38 4x100 relay champion goes to the Hong Kong team, silver for the United States, and Japan gets the bronze. Congratulations to Hong Kong for winning their first Paralympic gold for this event! -Get up! Get up! -Get up! We just won first place! -We won. First place. -Yeah. Get up! Look! First place! First place! Yeah! -Yeah! -Yeah! Yeah! -Sir! Sir! -You can't be here. Sorry. Yeah! Yes! Yes! My team! My team! Yes! -First place! -First place! Oh, they're here. I'm so excited. -Yay! -It's So Wa Wai! The bus is coming! He? he's looking over here. Wai! Hey, guys! Mama! Mama! -I miss you so much! -Wai! Mama, I miss you! Well done, guys. Wow, this is so heavy! -How are you? Are you tired? -Excuse me, So Wa Wai. How does it feel representing Hong Kong and getting your first gold medal? And you, Mrs. So? Your son represented the country at such a young age and garnered incredible results, how does that make you feel? It's? it's wonderful. So, "Mrs. Wonder Mom," just what exactly is your secret in raising your "Wonder Boy"? Eat lots of beef. As the mother of a Paralympic athlete, what do you think the government needs to improve on? Equal pay for equal work. What? Well, it's true. They're just the same as Olympic medalists. Why do Paralympians get so much less than Olympic athletes? They should be getting paid equally. For the work that they do, there's no difference. That's great. Well said! Ma. This is for you. When I was little, Grandpa always told me? that when you married Papa, you didn't have any gold jewelry. I promise I'm going to win lots and lots and lots of gold medals just for you. Runners are on their marks. SO WA WAI'S MOM SUPPORTS HER SON The gun has went off! Japan and Ukraine had a good start, Hong Kong started late and has got some work to do. Japan is in a good place, and he's already passing the British and the Chinese, Hong Kong in last. Things are not looking good for Hong Kong. Can he catch up after the turn? Japan is still in the lead with China right on their shoulders along with Ukraine. Japan, China, Ukraine, Great Britain. We're in the sprint now, Hong Kong is trying to get it up to second last place, and now he's closing the gap from behind, but there's still quite a stretch. This is the last 100 m. And everyone is giving it their all. Hong Kong is chasing hard, and he's still going strong. This is So Wa Wai, he's storming through the crowd! Japan is in danger now! He's going extremely well, and he's taken the lead! I cannot believe it! This is sensational! He is flying! Ukraine is catching up, with Japan still in second, but So Wa Wai is out in the clear! He's a force to be reckoned with. What an extraordinary run for So Wa Wai! He's gonna take home the gold medal! History is made for Hong Kong once again! The time is 24.36, a new world record! -Yes! -This is the third Paralympic gold medal for So Wa Wai of Hong Kong after the men's 100 m and 400 m final. This is also the third consecutive time that he has broken his own world record. Congratulations! Aah! -That's my son right there! That's my son! -Congratulations! Aah! Wai! -At the 2004 Paralympics? -Please stay back there. -?held in Athens, -Ready? Our Wonder Boy, So Wa Wai, won a gold medal for Hong Kong in the men's 200 m T36 classification, and at the same time broke his own world record. Congratulations to all our wonderful winners for receiving the 35th Hong Kong's Ten Most Outstanding People Award. Please step forward for our group photo. Thank you to all our media partners. Hi. Thank you. Again, congratulations to all the winners. -Hello, Mrs. So. -Oh. -Hi. -Hi. -Did I startle you? -Oh, no, it's okay. -This is my card. -Oh. Mr. Lau? Please call me Victor. My company specializes in representing athletes and the like. We help negotiate sponsorships and sometimes arrange advertisement deals. You see, gaining popularity is one thing. But what's more important is the extra income. I'm sure, you know how hard it is to be an athlete especially in Hong Kong. Excuse me. -Huh? -The reporters are waiting. -Oh, uh,? -They want to interview -both you and Wai. -?just a second. -It's all right. Go ahead. -Okay. Mr. Lau, how much can one earn from, uh, single advertisement? Uh, it's really hard to say. But if there's one thing I can tell you, it'll be much more than winning a gold medal. Ready, ma'am? Uh, okay, I'll be right there. Guess I'll be seeing you. I'll look forward to it, ma'am. Bye. Goodbye. Take care. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. After four years, the next Olympics will be held in Beijing. Um, for us Hong Kong athletes, uh? It is? It's extremely meaningful. Um? I hope that I will be able to run faster than ever before. And hopefully, break my own personal record. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, everyone! -Coach Fong? -Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much. -I got it. -Oh, this beef is so good. -Here have some of it. -Oh, yeah, I'll have some. -Thank you very much. -Gill, we have your favorite fish balls, so go eat up. Yes, I will. This is so delicious, thanks. Coach Fong, for the next Paralympics, I want the 100, 200, 400 events. Sure. That didn't take much convincing. Look, if only Gai and Keung weren't over the age limit, -I'd have put them in the 4x100. -Wow. Wa Wai, your coach has so much faith in you. No, no, I'm just spreading my bets evenly, that's all. -Happy a good Festival. -Happy Festival. Wai. Huh? Here. Why do you always wear flip-flops? Ooh-ah! You don't cut your toenails? -Of course, I do. -I'll cut your nails for you, So Wa Wai! -So Wa Wai! -Don't! Don't! Want some orange? Wa Wai. I have a brain teaser for you. What, Ma? Why do you think Ming runs faster than a train? Because Ming runs really fast. Wrong! Because? because it's a toy train! Why is it that you and Gill have the same answer, Ma? Why is it so hard to believe that Jack could really outrun a train? Why do you always talk about Gill, Wa Wai? Why don't you tell Gill that you like her? Why would you say something as silly as that, Ma? Don't you ever, ever repeat something? like that in front of her, okay? Stop pretending. You can't fool me, kiddo. The sun is bright, the wind is cool. It's a perfect day to ask a girl out. Wa Wai, you're a big boy now. So ask. Too bad, I can't hear you. Hey! What was that? I can't hear you! Wai! Faster! Faster! Wai! Come on! Oh, you did it. My son ran faster than a train! Oh! Wa Wai! How am I supposed to know why he got into a fight? Uh, excuse me, nurse, where's the Osteology? -Take the elevator to the seventh floor. -Thank you. I have to go now. I'll sue him! Honey, take me to a private hospital. Make sure you get me the best neurologist. He has to pay for what he has done. You fell down the stairs on your own. Who do you want to sue? Don't lawyers have fees, huh? All the doctors here have fees. Tell me, how much exactly do you have? The doctor wants you to rest for two months. If you twist your neck again, you'll be paralyzed. Ma, I spoke to Keung about this a while ago, and he said he could recommend me to the courier company. No, Wai. You're out there training all day, and you want to do courier work, -how could your leg survived that? -Even better, it will be -a part of my training. -I said no, Wai. I can just get another job. Kin Wai, stop playing basketball for the time being, maybe for two months. You can help me take care of your papa. Help him with going to the toilet and stuff. I play football. Hello, Victor? Yes, who's this? This is Mrs. So. I'm wondering if you could get advertisement deals for my son? It's a little difficult nowadays. The Olympics are still years from now. No one will get athletes for advertisements. But given your capabilities, I'm sure you can find something. Oh, how kind of you. I'll make some calls and get back to you right away. Thank you. I'll call again in a couple of days. All right, I'll get back to you if I hear anything. Get some rest, Mrs. So. Goodbye. Here. Take it. Give them the money and take the gold medals back. Take it, go on. No? Here. I still have 3,000 in the bank. That is all that's left in my savings. Take it! Take it all here! Take it! I said take it! Take it all! Do you know that your brother won each and every one of those medals with his blood, sweat, and tears? How dare you sell them? You're a disappointment! I already know that! I'm a loser, not like my brother! Have you ever looked after me? Do you know my favorite food? When we go out for Christmas, my steak is always missing. My hamburger has no patty! I'm your son too, Ma. You just had me to take care of him. That's why I'm making money! You know what? I don't play basketball. I've been playing football, Ma. Ma. I spoke to Keung about maybe working with their courier again. Then he said they were still willing to hire me. I told you not to worry about the money. Come on, Ma. Ma, I don't wanna run. I wanna make money. Think about it, Mama. I've already been to the Paralympics and won several gold medals. It's all right. I don't wanna see you working four jobs a day anymore. I don't want my little brother to make a living just so I can keep running, Mama. Hmm. I don't want any of us having a hard time. It'll be harder for me to see you quit running. People look up to you because of what you've done. But I don't look up to me because of what you're going through. No? Wa Wai? Okay. No. Okay. All right. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine, Mama. Wai, have some breakfast. Okay. Uh, and this one? I've been waiting for you, you're so late. Hey, stop it! You're still eating? It's 3:30. I'm sorry because? I don't understand what you're saying! The Paralympics Committee called and they want you to be the official torchbearer. I don't think I can. I'm not really an athlete anymore. I'm a courier now, Coach Fong, you see. Are you sure about that? You'll be over 30 by the next one. This might be your last chance to do it. Coach Fong. My father still isn't able to go back to work. Right now, I'm making around 7,000 a month working at a courier company. Once I become a regular employee, then I'll be able to get a 13th month's pay. If I go back to running, I only get 3,000 government subsidy a month instead. The historic Olympic flame touched down in Hong Kong from Ho Chi Minh City earlier today. The torch relay in Hong Kong has formally begun. The first time Hong Kong ever since part in the torch relay was in 1964 during the run-up to the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. This is the city's second Olympic torch relay. At eight o'clock this morning, the Olympic torch relay officially commenced at the Hong Kong Cultural Center Piazza in Tsim Sha Tsui. Notable celebrities and athletes will join hands for the passing of the flame. The entire relay will last for about eight hours, passing all throughout Hong Kong. Crowds holding the national and HKSAR flags have lined the route while the torchbearers are happily waving to the excited crowd as they pass by. What a spectacle indeed. Everyone wants to get a glimpse of the historical Olympic torch relay. COUNTING DOWN TOWARDS 2008 BEIJING OLYMPICS HONG KONG TEAM STRIVES FOR ANOTHER GROUNDBREAKING VICTORY Hello, Victor. It's Mrs. So again. Mrs. So? How may I help you? I remember you said that you were having difficulties finding deals for Wa Wai? The Beijing Olympics are about to begin. Maybe now you can help him? Sure, Mrs. So, but I thought Wa Wai wasn't running anymore. Honestly, it might be difficult not unless he runs in Beijing. Of course, for sure. He never said he'd quit. -Wai! -Huh? -Run faster, you're too slow! -Okay. Wa Wai. -Hmm. -I got some ad deals for you. With the extra money, you can keep running. What do you mean? Advertisements? You look so adorable. -It's very nice, Wa Wai. -Thanks. Ma, can you stop laughing? You really look the part. No, Mama. I don't look anything like him, do I? -You look cool! -Doesn't he? Absolutely. You just like the real Wonder Boy in the flesh. -The clients gonna love this. -Really? I'm not kidding. The client will fall in love with this. Okay, he's ready. All right. Wa Wai, we'll do a rehearsal first, okay? Mrs. So. I've gotten a few sponsorships for you. We got some shirts, pants, shoes, socks, and some health drinks. Just sign here -then I'll send them to you. -Oh, look there? -Okay, Wa Wai. It's almost over. -Are they free? That's what sponsorship means. I see. -I'll help you with that. -Oh, thank you. That's fine. Wow. They are generous. Oh, it's not that they're generous. It's because I'm that good. I see. You're really running today. You sure about that Wonder Boy. Why would you say that? How was it? How long? You're back to the time you were at Atlanta. That's pretty normal, it's not like you've been training. You have eight months before the Beijing games. I know. You need the deals to keep running. Don't worry. We'll make up for the lost time. Since you have a slow start, you've got to run up to 50 to catch up with the rest. That's why 200 m is the best distance for you. Because there's time for you to catch up. But you have another issue, it's your balance. The 200 m track is curved. You have to start practicing from the outer track going inwards. You have to run towards this line, turning it into a straight track. It may take longer, but we need to lessen the curve. Please try one, sir. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. Again. Your start has always been your biggest problem. Because you're wearing a hearing aid, you start late. You're the last to hear the shot. One, two. One, two. One, two, three, smile. If you want to get faster, then we have to focus on how you start. Hey. Are you So Wa Wai? -I am. -Oh, my gosh! You're even more handsome in person. Here's a balloon for you. I can't. My fingers are too weak. Then make them stronger. You're not a celebrity. For you to catch up, you have to try methods you've never done before. I will train your fingers as well. Even if the progress is one-tenth of a second. Hmm, again. Look over here, look at my hand. Do you see me? Lower, stride. Can you do it higher? Over here. Higher. Come on, now. -Lower. -Higher. Lower. Faster. -Higher! -Again! -Higher! -Lower! Lower! Higher! Wai. Come on. One more time. No, I really need to train now. You would have been done if you did it right away. Can he train now? Do you want him to get in or not? All right. Fine. He's coming. Go on, go ahead. Mrs. So. Victor, I'm not saying we're not gonna film the ads. But Wa Wai's current time is worse than when he was in Atlanta. For now, he has to focus on training, huh? I've negotiated these contracts for you this week. Take a look at this one. Oh, I'm sorry. Just look at the numbers, Mrs. So. Why are you still hesitating? This is Wai's most profitable time right now. Does he have any plans after retiring? Here in Hong Kong, it's hard enough for a normal athlete to support himself after he retires, let alone someone like Wai. In helping him earn money. That's the best way to support him as his mother. There's this saying? one that every athlete should know. "Moment of glory is temporary." It is not forever. How can a champion go around smelling like a tramp? -Hmm. -Cut! Good take. Now, for the next scene? It's going very well. By the way, I'm really sorry. We're a little late because of training. You call a five hours a little? Will you be paying our overtime? Will he show up late for races? I understand, but I need to take a break. Wai, what are you doing, huh? What happened? Wai? The director just told me I was speaking too smoothly, and I didn't sound like So Wa Wai, and he told me that I should stutter on purpose to sound like someone who has cerebral palsy. I don't get it. Why does he want me to do that? Yes, but you have to listen to him Wai. Do what the director asks you to do. If that's stuttering or speaking differently then you have to do it! Isn't it normally hard for you? Go on, finish the shoot. Come back. Again. Press harder. Again. One more time. Wai! What's the matter? I just wanna run, I don't wanna keep practicing this way! Fine, then quit! Forget it! I've been trying to help you! But it's only ever your way, not mine! How long are you going to keep wasting my time? I know that the only thing I need to do is to keep looking forward, and not I'm looking at that! Yes, I know I starts slow, I get it. But that's exactly why I sprint so that I can catch up with everybody else! Catching up was the story of my life! Wa Wai. The interview that has been scheduled by Victor was moved to tomorrow. I have training tomorrow. No problem. Then we'll just take a leave from the Sports Institute. Why would I? But I need the training, Mama! All right then. I'll just tell Victor to reschedule it. I thought I only needed to do it once. Why do I keep getting more? Just be patient, Wa Wai, there's only a few left. Hang in there. Ma, I just really wanna run. Wa Wai. You can't run your entire life. After shooting these, you'll get a few more hundred grand. It's worth it to run less. Run a bit less? Back then when I skip the lap it wasn't fine. Now you're saying it's enough! Wai. Now, you're telling me everything is okay. The key is with me. Cut! Let's watch the playback. Okay, playback! Excuse me, is there an outlet where I could charge my cell phone? You may use that one. Moving on to the next sequence. This is okay. We're ready for the next scene. What happened? Did you find Wai? My phone battery just died. The next scene we're filming is Wa Wai's. Yes, yes, okay. -Mrs. So. -Huh? Mrs. So, you have to talk to him. If he does not show up to the shoot, they will sue me for sure. And you'll have to pay too. All right then. Maybe he's just stuck in traffic. As soon as my phone's charged, I'll call him, right away. Please find him. For both our sakes. Fifty-eight times. What do you mean 58? That's how many times your mama's tried calling. Mrs. So wants you to earn more money because she cares about you. What if you tell Victor that it's all right for me to stand in for you? It would solve all my problems. Oh, you know what, Gill, there's? there's this one guy who wanted me to do a starting pose, and then he kept trying to tell me to turn my head up and look higher and higher. I said how could I possibly do that? -He kept-- -Wai! Did I get you a phone for the ringtone, huh? -Go on. Wai, go on. -Why didn't you answer my calls? Stay where you are! Do you know that we waited for you for eight hours? -Mrs. So-- -We will owe a lot of money -if you don't shoot the ad! -Have some water first. You talk to him! What reason would he have to listen? Maybe he'll listen to his girlfriend if not to me! Will you stop saying ridiculous things, Ma! You've always hidden your feelings, kept them locked up inside. I'll tell her if you won't. He's always seen you as someone special to him. You've never had a boyfriend, right? Not one in ten years. My son is a good man, why don't you like him? Well, ma'am? He doesn't have what I'm looking for. There are just certain things that I would rather keep to myself before anyone else finds out. Why did you have to say that? But I was helping you! Yeah, but you're not helping. You just want to control me. I just want you to find someone who cut your toenails for you. I don't need others to cut them for me. I can do it myself! You'll got them yourself? All right, go ahead. Show me right now. Show me! For over ten years, you have won so many gold medals from running. I've told myself, "My son is a genius." That my son is an extraordinary boy. But after this Paralympics, will you still be able to run? A time will come when no one will remember who you are. Who will look after you when your father and I are gone? Will you be content with the subsidies? I'll be a courier again. But your friend helped you. Otherwise, who would hire you? Anyone would prefer a normal person over someone like you. You're just like them, you never really treated me like a normal person. Since I was little, you've treated me like a handicapped. Even with my brother, you only had him because I was handicapped. You had me run because I'm handicapped, and you accepted all these advertisements for me because I'm handicapped. I can only imagine how hard it is to be handicapped. And it's just as difficult for me to keep being your mother. From the very day you were born, I was blamed for you. When I sent you to train, your father asked me why I was forcing you to run in the race. When you couldn't walk, I forced you to walk. And they would keep judging at all. "What on earth were you thinking, can't you see your son is crying?" Wa Wai! You have never been blamed for the way you are, right? I shouldered all that blame. Mama. Wa Wai couldn't even walk when he was younger. Who would've thought that he would turn out to be an Olympic champion one day? Turns out, nothings impossible once you put your mind to it. Even if you're slow in the beginning, you can still win. I believe in Seon Bon Insurance. I bought some wine. Coach Fong. Take this with you to Beijing. You could have given it to me tomorrow. I won't be there tomorrow. What's going on? Take care of him for me. Wa Wai is an adult now. He doesn't need anyone to look after him. On the track, it's very simple. Just keep going forward and you won't get lost. But in life it's different. Right now it is you who Wa Wai needs the most. Coach Fong. What do you think about Wai, is he extraordinary? I believe in him. If he says he can, he can do it. Much to everyone's surprise and disappointment Hong Kong's front-runner So Wa Wai only came in third place in 12.38 seconds. The men's T36 400 m race is about to commence. All participating athletes are ready at their starting mark. The crowd favorite, So Wa Wai, had a rough start in the 100 m run placing only in third place. Let's see if he's able to warm up and have a much better performance later on. Men's 400 m T36. On your mark. Set? The race had begun and everyone started out strong. At lane number four the aggressive Zheng Hai Feng from China. He's already overtaking Ukraine's Viktor Buka at the first 100 m curve. Russia is closing in at third place, meanwhile, Hong Kong's champion So Wa Wai is still lagging behind in the first 200 m. Unsure if he can catch up in the end. Looking at the final 100, Zheng Hai Feng is definitely speeding through leaving the rest by a mile crossing the finish line with 54.14 seconds. Ukraine takes home the silver, and Russia gets the bronze. So Wa Wai only came in sixth. He's probably just as surprised by his shocking performance today. I told you, the plastic bag doesn't work. Instead of crying hard, run hard. Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. Don't be afraid. You'll fail if you are. But I am a failure. I've lost two races already. Exactly. Why are you scared? -Ma. -Hmm? Do you have any idea why Jack runs faster than a train? It's because? He's got a Wonder Ma. That's enough. If it's wasn't for Wonder Boy, there wouldn't be a Wonder Ma. Oh? Wa Wai. You may walk slower than others, but you run faster than all of them. On your ma. Set, go. -On your ma. -On your ma. -Set. -Set. -Go. -Go. -On your ma. -On your ma. -Set. -Set. -Go. -Go. -On your ma! -On your ma! -Set, go! -Set, go! On your ma! Set, go! It's time now, Wonder Boy. You got this. Hey, Wai. Do you know when you look the coolest? No. -Wai! -Wai! -Wai! -Wa Wai! When you start running, imagine Mama watching you at the finish line. Get up! Wa Wai. You may walk slower than others, but you run faster than all of them. I want to run faster. I will always be there for you. On your ma. Set. Go. Faster! Faster! I know I can do this, Ma. Trust your mama, you will love this. I'm going to win lots and lots and lots of gold medals just for you. Yes! He did it! Wa Wai won, Grandpa. He won! Wai! Aah! Yes! You won, Wa Wai, you're incredible! AT THE 2008 BEIJING PARALYMPICS 200 M T36 FINALS, SO WA WAI BROKE HIS OWN WORLD RECORD AT 24.65 SECONDS. HE'S STILL THE CURRENT PARALYMPIC RECORD HOLDER IN THIS CATEGORY.
