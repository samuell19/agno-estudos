(maître) This is a plumcake of dried fruit ... ..with apricots, pistachios and marron glacé. This is a mini pavlova with pomegranate and spices. the recipe is secret. The chef doesn't reveal it to me either. Our flagship is the selection of nitrogen ice cream. - Nitrogen? -The fruit compounds, in contact with liquid nitrogen ... .. freeze and give life to a soft, silky ice cream. Everything's perfect. The location, the menu. That's what we wanted, isn't it, love? I am pleased to. The number of guests is 350, right? - Actually it's 400. - 400? Australia's cousins ​​have joined. Is it a problem? How can you contradict it such a beautiful woman? - What a treasure! - He's right. I leave you to desserts. - Let's talk about the details later. (Claudio) Thanks. (Anna) Thanks. - How much does a dinner like this cost? - 200 euros, at least. - For 400 guests ago? - 80,000 euros. -80000? People are crazy to get married. The next test? - Noah's Ark restaurant, all fish. I said you're from Catania. - No. - Yes. It's good, isn't it? - Yes. It's nitrogen. It is silky. ALARM SOUND (Anna) Good morning. - Is there nitrogen ice cream for breakfast? - Rusks. - Nitrogen? - No, with palm oil. You can start the day with a shower with water at the right temperature. - No, another time the water heater? (Anna) Yet he is not old. He is 15 years old, he is not old. Hello Uncle. - Good morning. (Anna) Good morning. The water heater is broken. A cold shower is the perfect start for another shitty day. Today's interview it will not go wrong, it will go very bad. He won't like your project. They will treat you like an idiot. Thank you. Crack the wolf. - Hello. - Hello. - Will you give me a lift? - Eh? - Eh! - Ah! It does not seem, but they are very comfortable. A web portal that allows you to evaluate the experience of professionals ... - How am I? - You are disgusting. Good luck. Let's do the dog. The panda. (together) The flower necklace. Aren't you going to break your cock? Guys, sit down! (Paolo) Come on. - Sorry, I was looking for the director. Claudio. - Yes. -Zero preambles. You have a minute to do your "pitch". - Go. - So... - Now. - All right. Practically ... ..we know that there are sites on the net that allow to evaluate ... ..hotels, restaurants, hospitals. - Whores. - Like? -There are sites that allow you to evaluate whores. All right. What is missing is a portal ... ..that allows you to evaluate freelancers ... ..and choose them based on the experience of other users. How do you choose an electrician? By word of mouth. Ask a friend. So I had the idea. "LavorAdvisor". You connect ... ..read if one has been good or if he made the invoice ... - See how many stars it has and choose. - You are very good, Claudio. But you are old and cannot do two things simultaneously. Okay, is that ... Sit down. I checked your Facebook profile. You are 38 and you are from Rome. I'm Roman, but I've lived here for many years. My fiancee is from here. (Milanese accent) By now I'm practically Milanese. - It's a joke. - Do you know what I like about Rome? - The plane to Milan. - We, on the other hand ... - It wasn't a joke. You have to put the profile photo. If you want to work on the web, the face is fundamental. I don't like taking selfies ... The photos. - LavorAdvisor is a brilliant idea. - I have a degree in Computer Engineering. - What do you do now? - I work as a computer technician. So repair virus-infested computers taken from porn sites. How much you need to put LavorAdvisor online? - I thought 20,000 euros. - On the net you do them easily. - What do you mean? -This project it's perfect for crowdfunding. You launch an online fundraiser, create a community ... .. then we enter and we sell you a bigger portal. Easy, right? Funded project. 5,000 euros per month, car, driver, beautiful secretary ... ..Business Credit Card and private flights. Did it go so badly? I'm sorry. - But I have a solution. (Anna) Let's talk about it later. - Okay. - Hello. (Linda) Giovanna has a surprise. Are you pregnant again? - Yes. I work two more months ... .. then certified and see you in a year. - It's nice to be tenured. Lucky you. If I was tenured, I got pregnant twice a year. - I'm going to those bastards. - Best wishes. (Claudio) Submit the project on the web and, if you like, they make you an offer. ninety two 00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.959 - I do not understand. (Claudio) You don't listen. - I have to make a presentation video. I wanted to ask for information. My daughter is getting married in October ... - Excuse me, is it open? - No. - Its tuesday. - Can't it be closed on Tuesdays? Outside it says that you close on Thursday. This week, we are closed on Tuesday and Thursday. - When can I go over? - Try Thursday. I like your friendliness. If you do this, you no longer work. - Are you afraid you won't pay the rent? - Keep your face even at home. If this muzzle bothers you, I'll go away. I wanted to be a fashion photographer ... ..and I ended up in Gallarate doing weddings to support the family ... ..and that comes to me to say:"The relationship he fell apart. Let's give it a shake. " "The solution is separate houses." - Separate houses. -If you show yourself like this, Ivana doesn't change her mind. It was you who said: "Come to us for a week." "You will miss her and she will change her mind." Four months have passed. - These modern bullshit! - Show yourself more independent, superior. Show yourself more smiling. Can you smile a little? Here, this. Bravo, like this. - You make me the video for crowdfunding? -That would? I explained it to you, is an internet fundraiser. - Do they really give you money? - It's sharing. It's the beauty of the Internet. Come on, let's get started. (Claudio from the monitor) LavorAdvisor. Read the reviews ... ..and contact the best professional. - What are you saying? - Not - 20,000 euros. -I can do it. The first offers are coming. - It takes time... - How much have you collected so far? So far, 41 euros. (sing together) Happy Birthday to You! Even the candles? Come on, mom! I have 20 years. Even the song? (sing together) Happy birthday to Silvio! Happy Birthday to You! (Ivana) Best wishes. - Best wishes. - You're such an asshole. - Don't treat it that way. The boys, after 18 years, have these attitudes. In fact, he was an asshole even as a child. Matter of DNA. You, Franco, how are you? - She's fine, aunt. - Great, really. - The activity is also fine. - We never see him at home. He is always cheerful. Smiling. How can one, after 30 years of marriage, to do such bullshit? - I understand. Happy birthday, Silvio. - Explain it to me, really. - I've been thinking about it for four months and I don't understand. - Don't start again. It is a modern thing. It serves to rekindle the passion. What do you say, Ivana? It is not a normal thing. These are things Americans do. To do a strange thing it was enough to sleep in separate rooms. We don't have two rooms. Anyway, I didn't kick you out of the house. I made a proposal to save the relationship, the LAT ... .. "Living Apart Together". Like when we were engaged. You were shaving, showering ... It's beautiful. Come get me to go to the cinema, let's go out for dinner and take me home. - Then maybe I'll get you up. - Will you let me up? This is my home. - I paid the mortgage too. - You are material. Come back, you have the keys. I don't even think about it! Did you want to be strange? You will ask me on my knees to come back. Let's go away, please. From my home. - Well, isn't it? - Very well. (Franco) It's bullshit! - What do we want to do? We can't send it away. We need the money in the little room, at the moment. What does money have to do with it? He is my uncle. He's your aunt's husband and between them both ... To a student we could ask for a higher rent. - Claudio! - Of course, you can't. - Can not be done? - You can't send it away my uncle to put a student. At best, to put a baby in it. (Franco) Fuck you! (Claudio) A newborn would make us sleep more. LAUGHING This is dead. Dying, I would say. We need to put in a new one. Then there is the disposal of the old one, pipes, gaskets and labor. - It takes 600 euros. - Can't fix it? - 200 euros and I fix it. - 200 euros are less than 600. But in a month, I will have to come back. This certainly breaks. Maybe it's probable. What is the percentage of possibilities that it breaks again? Let's say 80% certainly breaks. - 190 and 200 euros. - Thank you. See you in a month. It's safe. On LavorAdvisor it would have a star. - I understand why it got stuck. This stuff is illegal. - It's not illegal. - I did research for work. - Have you become a gynecologist? For which research did you click on "obedient schoolgirls"? - Even paid sites? - I thought they were safer. Instead of throwing money into this stuff, make a donation for my crowdfunding. - At least it's useful. - Okay, send me the link. - I sent it to you already. - I missed it. Already. GEMITI FROM THE COMPUTER Is that a pony? - No. - Yes, it is. Mum! HIGH VOLUME MUSIC - Hydrobike? Where did you find it? - Free lesson was selected ... .. together with belly dance. (instructor) Come on, girls! (Giovanni) Swimming pool and cycling. They invented a sport with the things I hate most. (instructor) Let's pedal. Anna and I have spoken again to have a child. - Just talk or ... - We want it, but we make little money. - If crowdfunding got in the way ... - How is it going? Not much money came ... ..but two weeks have passed. - I gave you 20 euros. I can't do more. My wife he doesn't want me to spend money on fucking. (instructor) Come on and on. - It's nice when friends encourage you. - Come on, go? - Well. - How much? - 73 euros. - There were 78 yesterday. - One withdrew 5 euros this morning. Do not panic. You also said which is normal at first. - The money will come. - What do you say? I asked for friendship on Facebook to many people and I put the profile picture. Look this. He raised $ 30,000 for tariff underpants with pocket. - What is the pocket for? - What the fuck do I know? He collected the money in 10 days to rate this bullshit. - These panties intrigue me. - Come on! - Tonight we're going to the 40-year-old party of Giovanna's husband. - A party, no. - If we stay at home, you get depressed. - I don't want to see people. - What are the two words most beautiful in the world? - "I love you". - I'm serious. - "Open bar"? Open bar. (Sergio) By now I look at her and she gets pregnant. laughs (Sergio) True, love? Will you accompany me to have a drink? (Sergio) Love, will you get me a mojito? What do you do? - I'm a computer engineer. - Where do you work? Self-employment. I am developing a web portal. - A web portal? - I started crowdfunding to finance it. I'll show you. It's called LavorAdvisor. - I'll show you the presentation. (Gabriele) Show me. You can't see it, the screen is broken. Look. - What's this? -Yes but ... - Have you seen the video of that of Salerno? - No, which one? - The husband comes in, finds her with his lover ... ..and they do a threesome. - It's fake. - No, she's a slut. (Gabriele) Show me. Look. You know those nights when you don't want to drink ... ..and in which you would never get drunk? - Is this so? - Yup. - So smooth water? - Very smooth. MUSIC IN THE HALL yell - Fuck you! - To me? No, fuck you in general. - In general. - Do you know what I would be if I were born in America? American. I can't ruin my life, because people don't understand shit. Vodka tonic it opened your mind. They don't understand shit. They stand in front of the computer watching people fuck. - Claudio, shut up. They hear us. - No. They must know, these shit wankers! - Claudio, they hear us. - Shit jerks! - They hear us. - Now I'll tell you. - To who? - To wankers. Now register. Wankers of shit, people of the Internet ... RASPBERRY I asked you for 20,000 euros ... ..for an app that would improve your life. Instead you just like it stand in front of the computer and make the saws. Claudio, that sucks. What do you say? They need to know. If I made a porn video, they would be more interested. Let's do like this. If you give me 20,000 euros for the app, me and my beloved girlfriend Anna ... .. let's make a good porn video and we put it on the Internet. Are you happy like this? This is what interests you. Come on, people of the Internet, raise your hands from your underwear and put them in your pocket. - Now I'm publishing it. - Thing? - They need to know what I think. - If someone you know sees him? Who sees it? They gave me 80 euros in two weeks these fleas. Pulciosi! Here, I uploaded it. Do you know what we do now? We make ourselves a nice beer. - To degrease? - Good, love. To degrease. (Claudio) Plan. LAUGHING - Of course Milan is beautiful. - Italy is all beautiful. ANNA VOMITA Too bad there are Italians! CLAUDIO VOMITA (Franco) Did you have fun yesterday? You have a face! Now I read you in thought. You are thinking: "I will never drink again in my life." In the head, you hear a hammer making BUM, but don't worry. You will be like this all day, in "hangover". What a refined term, to say that one is shitty. It's bothering you? DRILLING NOISE I leave you in good company. HAMMER SHOTS This raised $ 17,000 ... ..for a cake mold in the shape of a Greek Pi. - Better the pant with the pocket. - I thought this would solve it. - I was already thinking about teaching algorithms to our son. - It's not a tragedy! The important thing is that we want a child, the rest does not count. - And how do we do that? - We save. I talk to my parents and you say to your father to return your money. - I don't remember what we gave him. - I do. 4,850 euros. Okay, I'll close. I close everything and amen. In Italy these things never work. In America, yes, but in Italy with a crowdfunding they gather ... - 600 euros? - What do you mean? LavorAdvisor has reached 600 euros. I do not believe it. They make offers because they think we were serious in the video. - "10 euros to see this nude I am happy to put them on. " - "Come on guys"! - Close everything. - There is a comment in English. - Close immediately. -Sure. You thought you were doing something to improve the lives of these people! - What happened? (Anna) Nothing, why? - You're spoiled. - Because every time I'm coming, must something have happened? - Wasted and nervous. Is Claudio okay? - Yes, he's fine. - Some problems with work. - It doesn't matter, you have your salary. - It's not so easy. - We live with the minimum pension and nothing is missing. - You are another generation. - No, you are. When your mom and I took the bar, we planned everything ... ..and we could pay you for university. - I had a scholarship. - If I hadn't taken it, we were covered. - We don't do absurd shopping. How many tears do you use of toilet paper? - What do you mean? - When you go to the bathroom, how many jerks do you do? - I don't know, I don't count them. - Minimum 7 or 8. Two are enough. Spend a quarter. Yet you teach math. In a year, they are almost 300 euros less. - Indeed? - Yup. - Yeah. - Only toilet paper. - How do you deal with the unexpected? - If you foresee them, they are no longer unexpected. Already. Filippo, I go against my interests, but you have to calm down with porn. - "Granny-World". Pure old ones? - I like to wander. If I were to die in an accident, what would your mother find on the computer? Mom, no. Promise that if it happens to me something, make the computer disappear. It sucks me just to touch it. Find a hobby, read a book. - A girlfriend, right? - the Internet is cheaper. - The coolest girls are in here. - I see. - Yours is also very pretty. - I know Anna is nice. - Where did you see Anna? - In the crowdfunding video. It makes you laugh a lot. I also made an offer. - We were drunk and I closed it anyway. - No, I made the offer this morning. - This morning? - The idea is really cool. I can not wait. - This morning? - Yes. Great. You can't make a collage, with us in the middle ... ..and around the clouds with photos of grandchildren? - Can not be done. - If we pay it to do something, she has to do it. -Mrs... This was an extraordinary morning. I was happy because, coming here, in the car, I caught a strike. A traffic of the Madonna, all pissed as if they were in a hurry to get there. But get where? To do shitty work. A job where a lady asks you to do ... .. a bad photo collage ... ..with the clouds that, mind you, they float. Do you know what the real tragedies of life are? Those who push you to enjoy a traffic jam. - Franco, I need to talk to you. - Mrs. - What ways! - A disaster has happened. Goodbye. Nothing personal. What a mess? - Look. -What? - Offers have reached € 4,000. - For your project? - Not exactly. - For what? When we were drunk, I recorded a video where I said ... .. "If I reach the budget, me and Anna we make porn ", and they believed it. - Get the money and don't make the video. - No, they are promises of donation. P - Close everything. - I thought I did. I sent four emails, but they don't respond. - I was a jerk. - No, you weren't a jerk. You're a jerk. Here you are, bye! He is my son. How do you do? You are getting uglier. Strange, because the genes were good. - Hi, I'm Anna. - Pleasure. - You are STONE. It is Russian. - Romanian. - Nice to meet you, Claudio. Come here. I'm glad to meet you. Manlio has spoken so much about you. You are not so ugly as your father says. - Thank you, STONE. - No, Petra. - Petra! - No, stone. Feel what stuff! - You don't do these things in public. - I do. -Thanks very kind. How can you afford these places? - There are no more luxury hotels than once. - The hotel is beautiful. - How long are you staying here? - Some day. - How do you do with the restaurant? - I gave it up. -When? I can't close every night. I'm busy at night. - The restaurant is dead. - In Italy it's the only thing that works. - In Rome, then. - Everything has changed. Global warming, the greenhouse effect, melting glaciers. The temperature of the globe has increased by three degrees. Are so many. - We have a duty to do something. - What, though? We must invest in air conditioners. How beautiful these shoes are! - Dad, I need to talk to you about something. - STONE, these are called "sandals". - You don't have them in Bulgaria. - Romania. - Do you like them, Anna? Yes, but I wouldn't spend that money for shoes. Why don't you have them. What a pain. What a pain! (Manlio) Thanks. (Petra) Thanks. Dad, I have one thing to ask you. Tell me. (Claudio) I don't know how to say. If you can't say, meanwhile, I'll say it. That... - I do not have... - The sniper struck again. You didn't have to say it. It was a surprise. - The sniper? - I think it means that Petra is pregnant. 65 years old. I am infallible. - How did it happen? -I'm back at home drunk and I slept on it. You are such an idiot! You are a beast! - Best wishes. (Petra) Thanks. -Best wishes. - Give it to me. - No, absolutely no. - Manlio, it's not a problem. - No, you don't have to touch the receipt. We were thinking to move here to Milan. The baby must be born in a city ... .. less provincial and more oriented ... No, so you offend me. You don't bring a receipt to a woman! Then there is the problem of the climate ... I didn't find it so difficult. (Manlio) It is not true. - I understand. Thank you. (Manlio) Isn't it so cold and the fog? In Civitavecchia there is fog. - How was your evening? - Very well. Manlio returned the money and offered us dinner. Right, Claudio? - Like? - Why are you stuck to that thing? Nothing, a nuisance of a computer ... From the site do not respond and they started sharing the video. - You should tell her. - No, Anna doesn't know. He must never know. Ever and never. Find out for whom What happens? On behalf of the whole class. My father won't let me use the card of credit. Everyone put something. What are you talking about? - When the fuck were you thinking of telling me? - I thought I closed it. - Send an email. - I sent 18. - I told you not to publish the video. - We were drunk. I didn't think that people was so deficient. (Franco) 15,660. - Thing? - You have arrived at 15,660 euros. - That's a nice figure. - What do you say? It's money. - 15,720. They made a donation. - Don't get in the way. All right. I'm going over there. 15,750. - Uncle! - Do whatever the fuck you want. Tomorrow morning this stuff must be gone. - They replied from the site. - Did they shut it down? No. We have reached the required amount and crowdfunding cannot be closed. We have to wait for the deadline and refuse the donation. - The amount requested? - 20,000 euros. - How much? - Actually we are at 22,000. People keep sharing the video. He almost seems to be enjoying himself. Let's stay calm. Two weeks left. What do you want it to be? In the end, on this story, we will have four laughs. Anna. DOOR THAT CLOSES Claudio, everything is resolved. Don't worry, but don't show yourself like that. Be cheerful, enterprising. You smile. Can you smile? A little less. Here it is. I knew you weren't badass as you seemed. Those like you are the worst. - Anna is pissed off black. - There is nothing else in my office. - Someone put two euros as a joke. - What joke is it? - You challenged the Internet people and they replied. - It was a provocation. - There are millions of videos on the net. - Those are professionals, you are not. - He likes to spy on you. How far has it come? - 33,000 and is going up. - 33,000 to do it with Anna. It is brilliant. - I can not do it. (Giovanni) Poor thing! - I meant to go up. - I broke my cock. (Giovanni) Where are you going? (Recorded voice) Next stop, Cimiano. MOBILE PHONE RING Ready? Now? Yup. - You'll know why you're here. - Yes, for my project. - We want to be part of it. - I thought you wanted to wait ... ..that LavorAdvisor was online. - My project, LavorAdvisor. - Isn't that about porn? We are here to talk about the video, the viral video ... ..the one where you get drunk with what you call "girlfriend". - "Let's make a video, if you give us the money." - It is brilliant. This is rampant. If we move well, you make 150,000 euros. - There's nothing behind it. Then I don't call that ... "girlfriend". That's Anna, my fiancée. It really is. We just want to help you. We provide you with the facility, our know-how, skills. I'm serious. We were drunk, we recorded and published it. It was a joke. I didn't think this mess happened. RIDE Excuse me. (Claudio from the monitor) Take your hands off from your underwear and put them in your pocket. - What's up? - Professor Fassi. Can I speak to you, please? It is a misunderstanding. I won't be shooting that video with my boyfriend. I understand her. I had no doubt that it was a misunderstanding. But from Monday I have to stop it until a date to be destined. Such as? He said he understood me. What do you mean by suspending me? If he were to make the video, I would be forced to fire her. It's clear, isn't it? - The situation is getting worse. -I send mail, but they always answer the same thing. Something must be done. Let's go to their home. They will have one. - They don't even have a number. - This crowdfunding must disappear. (Franco) Are you sure? - I don't make my life ruined like this. - After all, they are asking you ... ..to do something you always do. - Yes, but nobody sees us. Not even for all the gold in the world. It's not all the gold in the world, but they are 60,450 euros. And they increase. - If this continues, we reach 150,000. - Claudio ... - They suspended me from school. - Then you need this money. Do as you wish, but some ships only pass once. Those were the trains. I do not know what to say. What are we doing? Tell me. Let's go to sleep. We'll think about it tomorrow. So much, at this point ... ..today or tomorrow... BUZZ PHOTOGRAPHS Ah! trickling Claudio. I had a dream. I dreamed that we had a home in the countryside, near a lake ... ..with white parquet and a fridge of the American ones ... ..with the ice thing. You had a studio with a bay window ... ..and I was teaching in a school with very polite students. And we had three children playing in the garden with our Labrador. - The Labrador? - Yes, the Labrador. Let's do it. - What? - I did two math. If we do that, we move house, we launch LavorAdvisor ... .. let's have a son and we are quiet for four years. - Are you sure? -Yes, if we do for a son, there is nothing wrong. - Listen, Anna ... - Listen, Claudio ... It is a matter of doing it only once. In the end, it's just ... ..to do... A porn. Viralize, socialize, monetize. Let's viralize the statement in which you say that you will make the video. We spread it on social networks with a link to crowdfunding ... ..where people make a donation ... ..buy the access password to your bedroom. Live streaming event upon the expiration of crowdfunding. - Live? -If you move well, you make at least 200,000 euros. What do you earn? The advertising return for our agency. - And LavorAdvisor? - With your money, do whatever the fuck you want. Now you will make a new video in which you announce your choice. How do I tell my parents? And think about your father. My father? As a kid he bought me porn. (Paolo) They have no idea of ​​the mess in which they are ending. Try offering them to me. - What is this? - It's chicken, dad. - Did you wash it? It's chicken curry. It looks like earth. It looks like chicken fallen on the ground. (Manlio) Since we haven't come for a nice meal ... ..that were you supposed to tell us? - We have to tell you something. You get married. I understood perfectly. What did I tell you? It's wonderful. Compliments. Are you getting married? Aren't you ... that stuff there? Atheists, but you can get married in the municipality. - What ceremony is it? It lasts a minute. - An ID card takes longer. (Anna) We don't have to get married. - Then I understand. Male or female? (Petra) You are pregnant! - That's why she's nervous. - I'm not pregnant. (Manlio) It's not even easy. You have to go by attempts and we know it, STONE! (Petra) Of course, my love. But what attempts? We can't afford a son. We couldn't afford it, but now we will do this. What will you do? - Claudio explains it to you. - Yup. It is quite simple. I had an idea for a web portal and I launched a crowdfunding ... ..that did not get results, until we have ... .. declared that we would a video ... hard. It had to be a joke, but people started donating. Now there is the real possibility to reach more than 150,000 euros ... ..and so we decided to do it. - I don't understand shit. - I only understood "150,000 euros". I got it. They have to make a porn video. What a porn! She doesn't understand, she is Moldovan. - Romanian. (Anna) In truth, he understood correctly. This is not really a porn video, it's more an intimate video. (Anna) Underwear. - An intimate video with whom? - With nobody. It is something we do among ourselves and that people will see on the web. If it is among you ... I said people will see us. They don't give it on Rai 1. Who sees this "web"? Who sees it? Do you want me to comment this bullshit? It's a huge bullshit. Always have children and there has always been a way to grow them. What does the video have to do with it? If you want to have a child, do it ... ..and somehow you will. - "Will you somehow"? - What does it mean? - Is Italian. Somehow you will. - It is easy to understand. - Say it too "It was better when it was worse." "Somehow you will do." Thanks, nice advice. I'm not telling you what I think, I'm telling you what I've done. You went on vacation ... - We made debts for yours brace. You did your debts and mom paid them. I don't want Equitalia's nightmare. (Manlio) Because you want the stroller with three wheels. You want to pay him the music course, the horse, football, swimming. Stop it, we're not at your house. This is a shared terrace. If your mother and I had waited the right time, you wouldn't have been born. Leave mom alone. You always made your cock. In my house, children have always been made and, as you can see, I still do them. The first one didn't turn out well. Let's go away, STONE. Thanks for everything, even for the food, especially chicken with sand. (Petra) Good evening. - Good evening. - How do you feel? - Relaxed, you? -At ease. I got these. With the white shirt and the rhombus one it sucks. - Wear them. - Yup. - Right here we have to do it? - "Right here"? We use a friend's photo set before they take it off. Do you see what a stylish place? Rather, do you mean this bullshit? (together) Yes. - All right. Releases ... ..and enter as I told you. Ready? Action. - We are here to tell you that we will share with you this experience ... -Intima. Intimate and personal. For some time, Claudio and I we think of creating a family. So it will be a family experience. It is increasingly difficult to save to be able to afford it. - Our choice will have a strong impact ... - Social. - Social and also existential. - Yup. You can continue to donate beyond the expected threshold. You will receive the password for private viewing. (together) We share our future. - Stop. - "Existential impact" was too much. - I missed it. How it was? - I'll confirm, some bullshit. (TV) A couple agrees to make porn ... ..to give birth to a child. - Come on! (TV) The subscription is approaching 200,000 euros. Let's see. (TV) - What do you mean? - No. - Sure. chuckles I would do anything for 250,000 euros. - 250,000 euros ... -I would think about it. - Would you think about it? - So? - 250,000 euros, hey! - Even for 100. - Never, even if I had a nice physique. INAUDIBLE WORDS (TV man) But did you see my wife? (TV woman) With my husband? (TV reporter) Parodies flock on the web. (TV) We are here to tell you that we will share ... - A porn. I have decided for some time to have this experience. - It's an ... anal experience. - Anal. - If we want... - It's hard to afford it. - Thanks ... thanks for the fuck. Impact... - Anal. Anal impact. Wankers of shit! RASPBERRY - Internet people. Impact... - Anal. - Anna? - Goodbye. - Let's take a selfie? (Anna) Yes. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Do you also take selfies? I'll give you three serious reasons not to do this. One, the video will always remain on the Internet. Two, your son will see it ... ..and also your son's son. - We understood. Three, the children are shown the video how they were born ... ..not how they were conceived. - You speak well. Your husband is a manager and you are tenured and pregnant. - Claudio is not jealous? - I don't betray him, he does it with me. - What about him? - No. - They'll see you naked. - It's full of naked people on the Internet. You want to be strange. Do not say anything? For all that money I would have made even the series! (Franco) I'm coming. - It is you. - Like If you were interested, you would ask me when I come home in the evening. Then I'll ask you another question. Didn't you say anything to Anna? - Tell me you discouraged them. - I'm helping them instead. - I do this modern thing. - It's an absurd thing. Only you can do modern things? I wanted to save our relationship. Because of you, I sleep in a future baby's room. Are not you happy? We no longer fight over dirty clothes. I'm not complaining about your shoes, you can see the matches ... - You can avoid me during menstruation. - You're in menopause. - You noticed, weird. - What a ferocious irony. What refinement to close a wedding. I have given up almost everything for this. "Quit"? I couldn't take you home anymore in his underwear... ..to complain that you had not become Oliviero Toscani. But you never thought that maybe you had no talent? TELEPHONE RING Ready? Anna and Claudio's manager? It's me. Say. Just tell me. What is it about? - Who are you talking to? - I do not know. It acts as a manager. - Are you free on Saturday? - To do what? Disco evening. They pay you. - I don't even think about it. - No, we're not interested. It is not a question of money. How much? Saturday you have a disco night. We are honoured. (Franco) A sudden change of course. Power of music. Sun glasses? Do you send them right home? Photochromic. For makeup? Yes, she only uses your products. Extraordinary products. Just take a selfie and leave it to us? Tribute? One selfie only. Let us reflect. (Franco) What transmission is it? "In their place"? Beautiful! I always watch it! I talk to them about it, but they will be thrilled. - Thank you goodbye. - I don't tell my facts on television. Tell me no every now and then. Anna, remember the dress test. - I don't know if I want to. I will be uncomfortable, I know. A lingerie firm. If I wear it for the video, they pay me. Anna! Sorry. I can? You did it. Now they take you in a fiction or reality show. - You turned. - I don't want to be an actress. Then I go back to doing what I do. I really like teaching. Sorry, what are you meaning for? Are you kidding me? You're too nice. - That's crazy. If I dress like her, drive me out of the house. (Claudio) How? - Yes, I speak on the wall! - If you take a selfie with that cell phone ... ..and you publish it, they give it to you and they give you 2,000 euros. No, the selfie is not. - Porn yes and selfie no? - No. Sorry if I allow myself, but it's a fucking value scale. (TV) Two guys make porn to have a child. I am ashamed! (TV) You left the country in these conditions. (TV) Now she tells me so, after 30 years of government. (TV) Honestly, she never gives me an answer. No. No. - Then? - They sent it to Sergio on the WhatsApp group of soccer. (Linda) He shouldn't have shown it to you. - What jerks. - Have you thought of everything? - I think so. - Have you booked the waxing? - Yup. I would not be able to show myself naked. With my husband, I do it with the light off. - Hair removal? - The day before. - No ... - It's not difficult to understand. It is difficult for everyone to have a child. I mean depilation ... there. - What do you mean? - Everyone will see you. How do you do it? - I don't know, I'll fix it. - Yes, but how? Classic, integral, Brazilian style, mustache, mushroom ... - To the mohicana, to the San Siro? - How would it be at San Siro? Thick in midfield and free on the wings. If you are undecided, go with the "total look". It's like the black décolleté, you're not wrong. Although this year the trend is hipster. (sommelier) We will taste the wine to understand its persistence and longevity. Then we spit it into the spittoon. Do this. (sommelier) The first white is young, yellow in color, with greenish reflections. - How do they give you money? The money is frozen on the site. They only give them to us if we make the video. - On social networks they will massacre you. - They're already massacring everyone. -Yup. - They make him a fanpage. - Money isn't worth all of this. For that money I fuck my mother-in-law as well. - Do you know how many people will see you? - Streaming? -Yup. - They donated more than 15,000 people. - 15,000? - It's like doing it in a Serie B stadium. (sommelier) Let's move on to the second. It's a more structured white, as seen from the golden yellow color. - If you can't do it? - What do you mean? You know how. You are there, the sweat ... - The agitation. - The thought of people looking at you. - And make a fool. - It never happened to me. - Everyone says that when it happens. - It never really happened to me. Then they say that too. (sommelier) The third wine is red. It is a young wine ... ..clear, almost crystalline. with garnet hues. Anna. We have just exceeded 200,000 euros. 200,000 euros? - Let's not celebrate. - No. - Claudio, what are you doing? - Sooner or later we'll have to make the video. At this point, let's try it out. Maybe it's fun. Who do you want me to come to see me drinking a gin and tonic? What the fuck do you care? Just pay us to drink. Good evening, here's Claudio. I am Franco, his manager. What are you already doing here? It's 22:40, were scheduled for 02:00. We normally ... ... we arrive a little early to make an inspection ... technical. Then there is a question linked to the metro timetable ... At a certain time it closes. Let's wait... What a shitty place! It's empty. Better, they pay us for nothing. I want you loads! SCREAM OF THE CROWD DISCO MUSIC (DJ) Here we go. We go on until 06:00 in the morning. - Let me understand. Are we staying until 03:00? - They pay us for this? - Think about how stupid people are. (DJ) Friends, here we are. We have a very special guest. The protagonist of the video that split the web. Milan people, put your hands on Claudio! (DJ) Guys, a scream! (in English) Welcome, Claudio. Are you ready? VOICE INAUDIBLE VOICE INAUDIBLE (Claudio) Shh! Only two sentences represent well evenings like this. The first: "Life is something elusive". The second:"But how much dumpling was there"? chuckles What the fuck do I care. (Anna) Claudio ... ..what do we call it? (Claudio) Who? (Anna) Goodnight. Who said these things? No. (Paolo) Click-baiting. You will find it worse. Click-grab headlines. Read a title, click on it, and inside there is nothing ... ..but those sell banner ads based on how many balls they click. (Anna) They quote quotes and people insult you. Social networks give the right to speak to the imbeciles who previously spoke at the bar ... .. instead, now, they have the same right of word of a Nobel Prize. - It's the invasion of imbeciles. - That's what you say. No, this is what Umberto Eco says. It's the web, beauty. - I have a strange feeling. - They are imbeciles behind a keyboard. - What do you care what they say? - We explain everything in the interview. (Claudio) It is not mentioned. Television, no. - I hate those broadcasts. - At least we'll stop the controversy. They just understand that we are decent people, everything dies down. Come on. All right. You are ready? Nervous? - He she... - Relax. You, follow me. Today's theme is: how much is our intimacy worth? For what amount would we sell it? She is a teacher, he is an engineer. They came to motivate their choice. We welcome Anna and Claudio, the sexiest couple of the moment. (presenter) Welcome. Take a seat. (Anna) Do I have to sit there? - You are welcome. -Hello, I'm Anna. Hello Anna. Hello Claudio, We are curious to know everything about you. Claudio, explain your project. LavorAdvisor is a portal that allows to judge the work of professionals ... ..and then ... - How the new portal is combined ... ..that connects professionals and customers, with a porn? - It's not porn. -At the beginning it was a joke, a provocation. But people paid money. Yes. Claudio and I have been around for some time we planned to have a child. - Only that, with our work ... - You have a good job, don't you? I am alternate and earn 800 euros per month. At the first delay on the cycle I am fired. You were expelled from school because of the video. When you go back to teaching, will you be a good educator? I think so. Audience murmur Claudio, you said to do all this for your child ... ..but what will you tell him when will it be big? Tell him about your disco nights. Look, Claudio. A busy evening, you will have fun. No, this is an evening ... Meanwhile Anna was home, and she is pregnant. - I'm not pregnant. - No? But are you trying? I mean ... - Let us understand, why are you doing this? For need of notoriety? Why do you like being watched? Or you want those 250,000 euros that would change your life. Is your intimacy worth so much? Or so little? Anna and Claudio, tomorrow at 22:00, they will take us to their room ... ..for 250,000 euros. You, what would you have done for them? APPLAUSE Fast, out. (TV presenter) Marco, before the interview ... .. tell me what you think of those who just came out? (TV) They are two geniuses. Look at what they invented not to work. It went well, we explained everything, the audience loves us. Now dust off the Telegatti and they give us a couple. Better than this... - Better than that, what? - I was joking. They think they treat us idiots, but now we treat them as fools. - What do you mean? Then they offered us the evenings and the money for two selfies on Instagram. - Yes, but with a massage oil in hand. - Let's get this money. - I'd stop taking the pill. - There is always time to make a child. If these are demented enough to pay for a photo with a condom in hand ... ..I take that money away. So much is tomorrow. Tomorrow. Let's make this video and it's over. Anna! Very cool interview. You were a crash. Look. (Miriam) TA DA! Franco, okay. Don't touch it. (Paolo) Put it more in the center. - You're very beautiful. - Are you joking? Cicciolina, in comparison, it seems a sophisticated woman. How are you? - What do you say? - Why the jacket? So it seemed more ... That is ... In fact, it is a sponsor. Everything good? Let's remember it's you and me and we're here for our son, okay? Yup. I asked you if you're okay. - I'm here for the two of us and for our son. (Franco) Ready. I put dim lights, "see and not see" effect. - Thank you. You stay? - No, I'm going to get some air. It won't last long, right? It is a joke to play down. I go. Guys. 254,000 euros. - Streaming is ready. (technical) Here we are. Crowdfunding expires in eight ... .. seven ... Come on, let's start. Five... ..four, three, two ... ..one. - We are here for us and our son. - What the fuck are you doing? - What did I do? - I can not do it. - Are you mad at me? Oh! (Claudio) Stop fucking! I can't do it like this. What the fuck are you doing? - Get out or I'll make you the scene! - Anna, please. - No kidding. -If we don't the video, we don't take the money. He reasons. Do I have to reason? What's wrong with you? Look at me, it's me. I'm Anna, the one who goes to school, shop at the discount store ... ..and corrects homework until midnight. You are the one who studies the programs to improve people's lives. I don't give a shit. I want my money. I can not stand it anymore to save 1,000 euros in seven years. It's not right. I committed myself, I studied and what did I solve? I panic, if the water heater breaks. Now I do like them, there is no way to do this stuff with dignity. In two minutes, I will have a good erection and we make this video ... ..we take our money and we will be happy. Fuck! Felici. I'm sorry my love. I'm so sorry for you. burps Are you coming back for lunch? DOOR WHISKING - Excuse me, a photo. She is sorry? - Please no. It's easy, just press the button. - Hello Claudio. Is the computer ready? - Not yet. - I need it for an urgent thing. - I know, I was messed up. You could have told me. I wrote it to you on Twitter, Facebook and Linkedln. - I don't have Linkedln. - Because? Because? Why Facebook? Why Twitter? Why Instagram? And Linkedln and Snapchat. Do you have Snapchat? And fiber and 3G mobile phone ... ..and the 7G and the machines Euro 3, Euro 9 ... ..and the web, friends, followers, i like, and "take a picture" and "tag me" ... ..update your profile, take a selfie, update status. Where are you? How are you? You could have given me a fucking call! Fuck you! Monday passes, it will be ready. Have you seen those two? Look at them well. It will be the second exit and they are about to kiss each other. They are looking for the right excuse to do it. See in the air that restrained, suspended excitement. Sorry. Claudio, I'll give you some advice that a friend gave me. Try to leave home. In a week you will miss her and will change his mind. I have to go, otherwise I'm late. - I bring Ivana to the theater. - How, Ivana? I'll explain later. - Including the split, 760 euros. - 760 euros? Without invoice, do you give me a discount? Yes. In the end, you save ... - Thank you. - Goodbye. (Manlio) How do you say "hurry up"? (Petra) "Grabeste-te". - GABRETETE! - No love. "Grabeste-you." - Claudio. - I'm busy, dad. - I have to tell you something. Come. - What's up? Come. - Put your ear here. - No. Come on, do me this pleasure. - That you feel? - What do I hear? DUM ... - DUM DUM. Is it the heart? - No, it's the feet. Your brother gave you the first kick in the face! - GABRETETE! - "Grabeste-te". - It's the same. I know you are taking courses here this year. I wanted to tell you it's going to be a shitty year. It's a terrible fifth. They sent that of English in hospital. Crack the wolf, thank you. - How are you? - Very well. I met an Albanian prostitute and I fell in love. She got pregnant. Difficult birth. He had an umbilical cord around the neck. But I prayed a lot. I converted. I became one of Jehovah's Witnesses. It's called Goran. A very sweet child. And you? I met a retired pilot, widower, with three children. A handsome man. We got married in Las Vegas ... ..dressed by Elvis and Olivia Newton-John. I have to buy the test to see if I'm pregnant, but not him. I had a fight with a steward Spanish. The condom broke. - You betrayed yourself with the conversion. - Your story was beautiful. It was improvised. - Instead? - I work with my father. He moved here. Opened a shop of refrigerators and air conditioners. - LavorAdvisor? - A guy in America did it. - He made a lot of money. - I'm sorry. Not to me. It means it was a good idea. - I already have something else in mind. You? - I'm not complaining. I'm no longer the school bunny. Just a few jokes every now and then. - Anna ... - I have to go. -Hello. And this? ARRIVAL MESSAGE SIGNAL (Claudio's vocal message) "I found it a restaurant for Friday night. " "Fake wedding?" ARRIVAL MESSAGE SIGNAL (Anna's voice message) "I can't, I have a refresher course." "Anyway, I'll leave the house too. Come get the last boxes. " "All right bye." - Thursday? - I have a wedding. Friday? - No, Joan Baez is in Milan. - Wasn't she dead? - No. - I'm coming too. - It sucks you. - Indeed. - Sunday. Saturday I have a dinner with those of high school. - Weren't they dead? - Just a few. - Alright then. - See you on Sunday. Hello Claudio! - Hi, Ivana. - Are things better? - I got an apartment. It is small, but it is close to the shop. Since we live apart ... ..I feel like I'm 16 again. - Has the passion rekindled? No, he's making me sweat. The other night, I took her home ... .. we kissed in the car, but he didn't let me up. - Nothing? - Just a few touches. In my opinion, this sex ... ..is a bit overrated. DOOR THAT OPENS (Claudio) Anna, is that you? - I didn't think you were coming back so soon. - Don't worry, go ahead. I'm practically done. I was leaving. I'll leave you the keys. I take it to repair. - I rest it here? I'll open the door for you. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Anna ... .. I wanted to tell you that I don't miss you. When I wake up, the first thought is: "Anna, who?" Making love to you is a pale memory ... ..also a little boring. Seeing you now leaves me indifferent. I wanted to tell you that I don't love you. For nothing. (Anna from the intercom) "Claudio." - Yup? - "Are you still there?" - Yup. - "Let's fuck." - Yup. - "Get in." - "I was wrong. I shouldn't have said that." - No. - "Sorry." - I don't have the keys, open. - Claudio. - Yup? Have you been careful? - What do you mean? - I stopped taking the pill. - Have you stopped? - Yup. - All right. - If I got pregnant? What should I tell you? Somehow we will. - I close. Come with us? - I make this phone and join you. I'll wait for you at the bar opposite. No!
