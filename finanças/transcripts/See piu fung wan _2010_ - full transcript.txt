Brother Mann, barbeque goose and pork for your daughter again? You are a good father. Here is today's news. Tang Qing, who has been charged for murder and drug trafficking, was released today, having found not guilty. That's ridiculous. Everybody knows that Qing is a murderer but he is freed because of a legal technicality Brother Mann, you police have got guns, Why don't you guys just shoot him? No trial is needed. We must uphold justice. lf l take the law in my own hands, l am no different from Qing. You're right. What are you looking at? Shit! It's a cop. Bobo, have a game with Brother Qing. Sure. Have a seat. What game would you like to play, Brother Qing? What game? l'd like to play rough. l haven't had sex for a week. Please stop. This is a public place. Brother Qing, please don't... Please behave yourself. No... Just do what Brother Qing asks you to. What's the fuss? l'll pay. No... Brother Qing. She is still young. Let her go. Eva, haven't seen you for a long time. lt's from Brother Qing, just take it. Brother Qing, congratulations! You won the lawsuit. Eva, I do admire you. Our big boss Brother lce is so powerful. Everybody respects him and address him as boss. But he is as gentle as a kitten when he is with you. Brother Ice is my good friend. He often comes to see me because he cares for me and wants to protect me. Brother lce, right? Here he comes, Brother ice. Take him to the roof top. l am giving you a present. Kid, it's hard to find you. l really fear that l will be screwed in court today. l got him ten days ago. Bastard, how dare you betray me! How dare you! Take your time. When you are done, let them take care of the aftermath. Do it nicely and cleanly. Don't worry about that. Uncle Dragon! lce, long time no see. How are you doing? lt is a young man's world. l am getting old. ls there anything you want from me? No. l just came here to see my god-daughter. Just have a chat with you as l know you are here. You are making a fortune lately. The business is quite good now. l supply all the drugs in these clubs. lce... l heard that you have a crush on Eva. She told me about that. But she said she doesn't want to hang out with anyone at the moment. l got it. Let's go and get something to eat. Who did this? lt's Qing, I told him to do it properly. Are you out of your mind? Get going, the cops will be here soon. Let's go then. Okay. God-daddy. l already said that. You still can't forget that cop? Did you see him? lt's been a year. He just vanished into thin air. l can't find him. lt is good fun throwing people down from the rooftop. You are drunk. Stay away. Get lost! l can drive even if I am drunk. There is a road block ahead. We are almost home. What are you afraid of? You damn cops! Checking cars in front of my home? Just go away. Your driver's license, ID card, please. l don't have them with me. Sir, I am sorry... Get lost! You are suspected for drunk driving. Please do an alcohol test. Test? Go home and test your mother. Please cooperate. What, cooperate with you guys? What if l don't? What are you gonna do? Okay. Don't come near me... Don't! Don't... Or i will kill her. l will kill her... What has that got to do with us? Psycho. You okay? Get in. Dad. Hop in. Uncle. What time is it now? Don.t you have school tomorrow? Tomorrow is our school's swimming gala. We are having our periods, so we are not going. Having your period again? F4 are coming to HK? They are out. Now the hottest idols are 1 987. 1 987? What is that? They were all born in 1 987, they are so handsome. We joined their fan club. Fan club meeting until 2:30a.m.? Uncle, can I stay overnight at your place? Have you eaten? l will heat the food for you. Call your mom and tell her that you will stay at my place for tonight. Mom went to Macau gambling. She switched off her mobile phone. And your dad? l haven't never seen him. Tonight, at 1 :30a.m., A physical assault case was reported at Kowloon Tong. Three Chinese men were attacked by thugs posed as policemen. Two of them died at the scene. The other one died on the way to hospital. The police suspect... Ridiculous. One man was taken away. Dad, can you give me $200? Take it from the drawer. Thanks, dad. Come in my room, let us go to the chatroom. Who did this? We used to hear you complaining about your daughter. Aren't you fed up? You don't have any children, you won.t understand. With such a long face, no wonder your daughter avoids you. PC 9388 report for duty, Sir. l am the new transfer from PTU. My nickname is Rocky. Have a seat. They call you Rocky? l was so skinny when I was small, that they used to call me Rocky. The name sticks with me. Our leader in PTU is Keung. He used to talk a lot about you. He told us Brother Mann was once a brilliant detective who solved many difficult cases. lt's been long time ago. l am old now, useless. l have nothing to do all day long. How can that be? Now, team A takes charge of all the big cases. Their head is Tiger. His team all wear sunglasses. They look like models rather than cops. Our team, the B team keep losing manpower. Just two of us left. You are the first new transfer in three years. l am here to learn from you Sir. You will regret. Brother Mann, i got important information. A new superintendent is coming. Someone called Koo. whose father is the Deputy Police Commissioner. So? That means the Commissioner will retire in three months, the Deputy Commissioner will then be the Commissioner. Koo will be the new star in the police force. lt doesn't matter who is the Commissioner. We will just do our duty. Miss, what would you like to have? Set A. Set A. Brother Mann, that chick is staring at me. Cause you are handsome. Brother Mann, that chick follows us. Girls nowadays are too outgoing. Come on, all the chicks are crazy about you. Morning. Superintendent Koo, morning. l am lnspector Tiger Chan of team A from Organized Crime Unit. You can just call me Tiger. Hello. You must be Inspector Mann Cheung of team B. Hello. l am Koo, the new superintendent. Looking forward to working with you all. Koo? Well. l have a man's name. You can just call me KK. My father talks a lot about you, lnspector Cheung. Thanks. We should go upstairs to attend the meeting. Alright, after five minutes. l will go and get changed, see you in the conference room. According to our sources, Qing is not the first mafia boss who has been missing. Dino, Kimo, Big Dough, have been missing for a while. With our success in undercover action these two years, many mafia bosses had left Hong Kong. They might be hiding in Thailand, the Philippines or else where... But our undercover agents inform us... something is wrong with their families. Their family members are selling everything at very cheap prices... Don't you think that's weird? lnspector Cheung, what do you think? l won't make a wild guess. l need more information. Sir, I think we don't need to bother Sir Mann. Uncle Mann is the wise old man of our unit. He is so precious to us. Give me the case--I will find out the truth. The police force require team work. We don't need any hero. Let's split into two teams. Team A will investigate Qing's case. Team B investigates the missing of the mafia bosses. Any question? Sir, just in case team B flops... l don't mind doing their job as well. Don't mind him. He solved three big cases in these three months. He's getting arrogant. Momentum is crucial. But experience is much more important. lnspector Cheung... Just call me Mann. There is no need to be so formal. OK--Mann, do you think the cases of the missing mafia bosses... are somewhat related? l am afraid they are. Firstly, they were all rich men, with big money. Secondly, they had all been arrested But got free due to lack of evidence. Lastly, they are all well known for being brutal and dishonourable. Even small time thugs won't respect them. No one cares when they've gone missing. l do have a daring assumption. The solution of many cases begins from a daring assumption. Take this case as an example, l don't think it's gang war. l think it is kidnap and blackmail. Honey... We want $1 0 million within three days. No $1 ,000 notes, only $500 notes. No consecutive serial numbers. They will contact you. Do as they say, or they will kill me. Just give them...the money. What should l do now? What can we do? l had kidnapped people when i was young. lf we don't pay the ransom, they will kill the hostage for sure. The Flood Gang did it. Let's kidnap their boss and trade in. No. Qing has so many enemies. How can we be sure who did it? What is the point of kidnapping their boss if the Flood Gang was not the culprit? Drop the whole idea. What? Then we will be disgraced. Yeah. That's enough. The boss of the Flood Gang has been missing for two months. l heard that they paid the ransom already but the hostage has not been released yet. The guys who did this are no ordinary thugs. Please tell me what to do. I am now at a loss. l will do anything to get Qing back. l will do my best. Then I put Qing's fate in your hands. You guys escort Qing's wife back. This way please. Can l take a look at the video? What did you find out? l was wrong. l thought that it's my tailor. Really? Eva lnform me immediately when something happens. l am leaving. Let's eat. Hey guys... Will you keep your words after you get the money? Let's see then. Have we met before? Just eat. lf you don't want to eat it, l will take it away. l will...I will eat. You can't forget her. l broke the robot badly. lt's a pity that you can't have her, right? l purposely keep it. l want to test you to see if you still think of her. Stop such nonsense. After we get the money, we will go to Europe. Then we will have kids and never come back to Hong Kong. Have some soup. How is that? My asthma is getting worse these days. You have to tell me when you don't feel well. lt's time to call Qing's wife. Only $500 notes. No consecutive serial numbers. They will contact you. Do as they say, or they will kill me. Just give them...the money... Just pay them... What do you think? lt's right to report this to the police. They have guns. They are dangerous. l think it's a bit weird. lf they just want money... they should kidnap the super-rich rather than mafia bosses. They are no ordinary thugs. We have no idea whether they are ordinary gangsters or not. You should report this to the police. Take the case. Yes. Tell Qing's wife to come to the police station to give her statement. Uncle Dragon, you are here? Mann, you are too impertinent. The coffee is getting cold, why don't you refill it for Uncle Dragon? He came to report a case. What is it? Let me have a look. No consecutive serial numbers... They will contact you. Uncle Dragon, thanks for your cooperation. George, David... Take Uncle Dragon over there to get a statement once again. l did it already. Mann, I am in charge of team A. l dare not bother you. I'll do it myself. What do you mean? Spring. How dare you talk to your superior like this? Mann, did you not teach your men to be respectful? Kid, you are smart though. l did want to give you a chance to work for me. But, not any more now. l will only work for someone that l respect. But that's not you. Okay. Why didn't you take Uncle Dragon over there? Yes, sir. Try to do it as slowly as possible. Hello? Qing's wife? Yes. Your husband is with me. Don't panic. ls your mobile number 98379837? Yes. Bring it with you, l will tell you what to do. l have to talk to my husband. Not now, maybe later. There are cops in your home. Hello? They know how we wiretap the call. They did the counting too. What should l do then? Will they torture my husband? Madam, you just do as they said. We have someone to protect you all the way through. ls $10 million ready? Yes. Get another $1 0 million. Because you don't keep your words. l don't have that much money. You own three apartments as well as $30 million cash. Selling drugs brings you a big fortune. l will call you three days later. Remember, if you want your husband back alive, get rid of the police. Otherwise... you won't see your husband again. Hello? Something happened. Hawk calling. The bird has flown. Go! Have some coffee. Thanks. Business? No, l just want to have a chat with you. Do you mind? l did smoke when I was in college. l quit now that it's prohibited in so many places. You are something. l have tried to quit six times, but in vain. You are not determined enough. Or you have something that you can't let go. Who teaches you this? When I was in college, l had a boyfriend. l broke up with him five times but every time l came back for him. He sweet talked me to go back to him every time. Then? l beat him up. l broke his ribs, then we really broke up. Do you really have to use violence? Anything that bothers you? You can tell? Tiger doesn't follow your order? He's a bit arrogant, but he is quite competent. l am afraid that he's too confident. About Qing's case...i am still wondering... We still don't know whom we are dealing with. When will the ransom be paid? Three days later. l hope your team B can take part in this action. lf you were them... where would you want the ransom? $20 million cash, in small dollar notes. lt's gonna be a huge pack. Ordinary kidnappers will choose a crowded place, where it will be easy to get rid of the police. They know the police won't open fire in crowded places. But I think they are no ordinary kidnappers. They might not do that. The ransom will not be delivered in a crowded place. We only want the money, we will try not to hurt any one in this case. They will tell Qing's wife to go to different spots. Hong Kong, New Territories, Kowloon... So that we don't have enough time to set up our trap. When the police are moved around a lot, they will get annoyed. As they get annoyed, it will be more advantageous to us. We can't mess this up. We must stay calm. So that they won't have any advantage. And they will get nervous. Then they will make mistakes. That's when we'll get them. Eagle, you take the high position. Bill, Hui... You guys hack into the police's computer system. l want to know what their plan is. Can, tomorrow you do as we plan. This time, I have a sixth sense that... we will be up against a worthy opponent Long time no see, Can. Very busy lately? Yes, take a seat. Thanks. Watch out. When are you going to have your baby? ln two months. Where is Sam? l haven't seen him for long time. l thought you are with him... My husband is from Taiwan. l bought you guys some cakes. Thanks. You are welcome. They have all gone out? Yes, I am handling some files for them. Are you okay? l get you a glass of water. Are you okay? l almost choked. Let me finish this, then I go for a walk with you. Okay, do your work first. lt's already half past eleven. Why didn't they call? Calm down! No point in being nervous. Hello! ls the money ready? Yes. Take the money and leave. Where to? Central, i will call you then. l know they will choose a crowded place. Central Tiger calling Swallow, Dove, Crow... ...Vulture, Phoenix. The Bird is off, you guys tag along. Don't lose her. Don't go to Central, go to Tsim Sha Tsui instead. Hello! Hello! l am now in Tsim Sha Tsui. Keep going, don't stop. Swallow, Dove, Crow, Vulture, Phoenix, don't get too close. They might be following the bird too, don't let them see you guys. Drive to Hanoi Road. Hanoi Road? lt's a one way street. Block it on both sides--no one can get away then. Hello! I am now at Hanoi Road. Take the money with you and go down to the MTR station. Okay. MTR station? Hello! Don't take the MTR. Take the bus to HK Island. Don't hang up. Get in the cabin and stay close to the door. Stay close! Stay close! l am now taking the bus. Get off now! Now what should we do? Go to the opposite side and take the MTR to Central. Take the Pedder Street exit. Lose them! They are fooling us. You are all rubbish. Pedder Street We have all been fooled. They forced us to abandon our cars and run. l am at the Pedder Street exit now. Go straight ahead to Lan Kwai Fong! Don't stop. Lan Kwai Fong To Lan Kwai Fong? lt shouldn't be! Lan Kwai Fong is a one way street, it's hard to escape. Maybe to some higher spots. Let's go up there. They want us to run from Central to Mid Levels. And give them the money at Mid Levels. My dear, who can run such a long way? We will get fussy and this is to their advantage. Hello! You can go shopping for five to six hours. lf you don't want to see your husband, you don.t have to go on. No...I am going. Just tell me where to go. Take the money to the Man Mo Temple at Hollywood Road. Man Mo Temple Stay close to her! Hello? l am now at the Temple. Walk up the stairs by the Temple. Tiger is really something. Have no back up, just like us. The back up didn't follow the main group. Once the location is confirmed, they can get to the scene as quickly as possible. No shooting without my order. Got it, Brother Mann. l am here. Did you see the truck ahead? Yes. Put the money next to it. Put your mobile phone on the money bag. Then you are done. They saw Qing's wife. They must be on the roof top or something. l didn't see anything up there. What should we do now? l don't feel right at all. What is it? No one comes to take the money. Maybe they saw us and dare not come out. Why were they here? Madam, did you tell them? Don't mind that, what should we do now? Something wrong with the truck, get those two guys. You stay and protect Madam. Freeze! Take them to the car! Move it. Hello? Tiger. Who are you? lf the organized crime unit only has guys like you... That would be pathetic. Come out, if you dare. Okay. l will count to three. One... Two... Run. Rocky, go get him. Okay. How is it, Brother Mann? lt's not gonna work, our guns can't reach that far. Go away! Don't move! Go away! Shoot at the sky. Cover me. Okay. Why did you close your eyes? l am trying to get the feeling. What feeling? The feeling of those past years. Have you got it? Almost... Don't shout. Good marksmanship. Go! No, l am gonna kill him. One more shot. l got it. What? l shot him. lt's done. Freeze! Lots of money... Don't pick that up. Police! Don't pick that up. Stop! Don't pick that up. These guys acted like an army rather than kidnappers. l think they are much more like the Special Unit in the Police. Bastard. Stop beating him...otherwise you kill him. l am doing this for Eagle. Please let me go... l have a big secret to tell you. l am not interested. You did recognize me. l know you are Eva's boyfriend. Shut up! Don't you wanna know who killed your little brother? My little brother... Stand still. Listen to me. l arrested many bad guys every day. And at the end they would all be released by the court. l fell in love with a woman... then they said l have links with triad societies. What is the point of being a cop? lt's not what you think. You are the pride of the police force. You stand here, i will go get a taxi. Go ahead. You let me go then i tell you. Once you release me... l will leave Hong Kong right away. And l won't tell. lf l die... you will never know. Okay. l promised. lt's lce. Not just your little brother, he killed Mann's wife too. Lock him up. Brother Sam, you go and kidnap lce. He should have at least seven to eight hundred million dollars. lt'd better to kidnap him instead of me. Brother Sam, please let me go. l can help you. Sam, calm down. We had fucked up today Eagle is dead. You'd better stop and don't go after Ice. Okay? l have been investigating my little brother's death for over a year. l can't stop now. But Ice is so powerful. lt's not easy to get him. Please leave me alone. Happy Birthday. Let's go for a drive. l won't take it, it's too expensive. lf you don't like it, just give it to your mate. l appreciate your good intentions. You have sent me flowers already. l want you to have something of mine with you all the time... How about this? lt's mine now. Good. Eva. Long time no see. Sorry. lt's all my fault. l thought you would never see me again. You suffered a lot because of me. l am thinking of quitting. l don't care anymore. l have too many enemies. My little brother died because of me. l don't want to get you involved. l don't mind getting involved. So long as I can be with you, l won't mind anything. One thing that l have to tell you. l am with Can now. Why did you come to see me then? l need a favour. l want to avenge my little brother's death. What can I do? You can do a lot. lce is the murderer. How is Tiger? He'll live, but he lost both legs. They suffered a big defeat this time. Madam, who is the man who got shot? The headquarters are getting nervous. He was once a sniper in the Special Unit. He was expelled because of indiscipline. An ex-policeman? Brother Mann, you have to help me this time. There are three men only in my team. lf you are willing to help, l.ll give you whatever you need Okay. What? Don't you need to go home? Dare to come with me to see 1 987? l haven't seen my father for a few days. As long as he left me the money for meals, I don't care. Please let us in. We won't disturb them. You know 1987 will come here for recording? We have been waiting here for a long time. Please let us in. What? Come with me. What's up? Just come with me. Please let us go inside. No...sorry, no entry. They are doing the recording; you will disturb them. Let us go inside. No, no way. Just let us go inside. Sorry, excuse me. Sorry, you can't go inside now. l live here. Sorry. Thank you. Sam is not here? No, he is not. All the computers in the organized crime unit are off. I can't hack into them. Never mind, we are gonna move. There are many fans downstairs. Reporters may come soon. lt's not safe here. l will call Brother Sam, and tell him to come back as soon as possible. You take a rest. lt's just up there. Let's climb up. Are you out of your mind? It's so high. What? You're scared? Me Scared? i will show you. Come on, get up. Are you okay? Yes, I will be careful. lt's the kitchen---did we go to the wrong floor? They said the studio should be dark. Be quiet. lf the security guards find us, they will kick us out. l am sorry. There is music, we came to the right place. Help...I was being kidnapped... Call the police. Are you okay? l am fine. Can, how are you doing? Let's pack up and go. lt's confirmed that there are six kidnappers. Five men and one woman. lncluding the sniper that was shot dead. One of them is a boxer... and the other one is a computer expert. Who is not likely to be an ex-policeman, We'll ask the computer crime unit to search his identity. The remaining man and woman... should be husband and wife or a couple. One of them has asthma. The man should be the ringleader aged 40 to 50. The woman aged 30 to 40. Tell them to start searching for suspects. Oh, my god! How do you know that much? You can know as much as I do if you observe well. l will ask someone to take you home. l don't want to go home. l want to stay here. Don't you feel cold? No. After i finish my work, let's have dinner together. Have you got any clues? l have checked the underground ammo trade, no record of any transaction. l have checked the triad societies. Since this incident happened, nearly all triad bosses are in hiding. Brother Mann. The forensic department did not find any matching fingerprints. Why take so long? Computer matching should get results very soon. l will check that again. No need. l just heard that the computer system of the forensic department got hacked. They will never find any matching. That's the problem. The kidnappers knew what team A's plan was. What are you doing? l am checking what software they used to hack into our system. You are good at computer? l know a bit. You know what? While we wait for retirement... We study computing. Big mouth is now a computer expert. l have never thought that you have been upgrading yourself. See---l am appreciated. Ha! Brother Mann, look! The Devil incarnated. Public enemy Number One. We will sacrifice our lives willingly. To do God's work---ridding the world of the Devil. What's that mean? A challenge to us. Wide mouth, can you get through to him? Brother Sam, the police is tracking our signal. They want to talk to you. lt's connected. Tell him that l almost know who he is; he can't get away. l know who you are. You can't get away. Bullshit. He has no idea who I am. He is not worthy to be our opponent. Tell him to hang on for 1 min 30 sec, l will know who he is. Either you disconnect now, or you chat with us for 1 min 30 sec, l will know who you are. Good. Just play with him. Send him our information. Ask him if he regards himself as the judge... and he can perform God's work on earth? Our law has too many loopholes. Criminals break the law but managed to get away taking advantage of these loopholes. lf we don't take action, they will continue to do harm. This is unfair to law-abiding citizens. You have killed so many people. You are a criminal too. l only killed criminals. But you just killed a 16-year-old girl. That's an accident. That is not an excuse. An innocent girl is dead, incident or not. This is collateral damage. It can't be avoided. We have the rule of law in Hong Kong. The law will judge who is right and who is wrong. You keep saying that you kill for justice. ln fact you are a greedy thug. Money is useful. lt is better to let me use those money grabbed by the mafias. At least I will donate half of it to charities. Stop being a hypocrite. l have to revise my opinion of you. You are not only a thug. You are a self-centered stupid thug. How about you? Your wife was murdered... and you just withdrew into yourself and cried. Why don't you avenge her death? l am not like you. l will avenge my brother's death. Sam Ho... You lost. How do know he is Sam Ho? l saw him once at Mid Levels that day. l sense that I have seen him before. After the sniper's dead, l begin to recall... He's with the sniper. But I couldn't remember who he is. l spent three days looking through the files and i narrowed it down to three men. Only Sam has a brother who was a cop. His brother resigned a year ago and was killed in a car accident. From our conversation, I deduced that... his purpose is to find out who killed his brother. To avenge for his brother's death. Raise your right leg and point it to the ceiling... Open your right arm and maintain your balance. Okay, turn your right arm. Pull your right leg back. Straighten out your left arm. Then pull your right leg back. Bend your knees. Straighten out both of your arms in opposite directions. Keep looking in front. Bring your palms together. Turn your upper body to the right. Open your arms. Keep looking at the ceiling Okay, turn back your upper body, bring your palms together Let's do another set of movements. Open your arms. Never for once do you accept my invitation to dinner. Today you asked me out for dinner. What do you want from me? l will get to the point. l lost five million in futures index last week. Can you lend me the money to pay it back? l will just give it to you. Don't tell my god-father about it. Of course. l won't pay you back the money. But...I can give you something else instead. Great. l will be your mistress for one month, then we don't owe each other anything. But you can't tell anyone. Or else l would rather sell my bar than to accept your money. Okay. Starting now. After you transfer the money into my bank account, i will be your mistress. The transfer will get done before 5:00 p.m. today. l will go to your place for dinner. Boss. Do you need me to go inside with you? Are you nuts? You wanna watch me having sex? Sorry. Stay here! Don't disturb me unless it is absolutely necessary. Got it. You are here? l am in the kitchen. You cook? For you, l cook. Go wash your hands. Dinner will be ready soon. But I want to have sex with you first. Don't be naughty! Go wash your hands! Okay. Dad, you are back? l will reheat the meal for you. No need... lt's rare that you cook for me. Don't eat takeaway any more. Try my cooking. Dad, I am warning you... You can only say it's delicious. You can't say it tastes bad. Or else l will never cook again. lt is salty. Salty? lt's really salty. l like your honesty. No wonder so many women fall for you. Don't bullshit me. Dad... The money is in the drawer--take what you need. No. l just want to say l had been unruly before and i said you are an useless cop. Will you still be mad at me? How could a father stay mad at his own daughter? l just hope that you will live happily ever after. Dad, I won't be a star chaser anymore. That's good. No star can be as cool as my father. Hello? Brother Mann, big news. Nga Tsin Wai Road was reported to find illegal firearms... l am coming right away. Don't you eat? Put them in the fridge. l will eat them later when l am back. Don't stay up late. l got it. Bye. l heard that your ex-boyfriend killed Qing. l don't want to talk about him anymore. He's now a wanted criminal. He has probably left Hong Kong already. l don't give a shit. l am going to take a bath first. How could you leave me alone? l have been waiting for you a long time. Bitch. You want money? How much? l love money. How much do you have to pay for my little brother's life? You can't take me out of here. My men are outside. Freeze! Police! Sir, what's going on? We suspect you of possessing illegal firearms. lt must be a mistake. Who's got firearms? Get down. Stand still! Don't move! lt must be a mistake. No one has any firearms. Brother Mann, we found something. l need to call my lawyer. Call your lawyer at the police station. Take them back. Yes, sir! Take them to the car. Be quick. Hello? Dad, I am having a stomachache l will take you to see the doctor. Okay, bye. Take him back to get a statement. l will join you later. Wide Mouth, give me the name of the owner of Ming Yuen Court, in 1 52 Nga Tsin Wai Road. What is the matter? The registered owner is Eva, owner of Fancy Bar. We have been set up. Take lce's money and leave Hong Kong. Take me with you. No. You can't stay behind. The police and ice's men will come after you. Did you just use her to kidnap ice? Now we got Ice, why is she still here? We must take her with us and leave Hong Kong. We leave with her? She leaves with us? Or she leaves by herself? Give him a break. Do you understand... l am not talking to you. That's enough. She'd better stay away from me. Otherwise... l don't know if l can control myself. l may just shoot her. l ask you once again, do you need to make a phone call? You kill all your hostages-why should I trust you? You have no choice. Don't bluff me. Three...two... l have 1 00 million in cash. lf you promise not to kill me, l will give the money to you. How can you make such a big fortune? Drugs. You must have ruined many kids' lives. Do you know how many psychotics there would be in 20 years? lf I care about this... l won't do drug trafficking. l will be a priest. Where's the money? At my place. The money is under the mattress. The entrance code to my front door is 2822 #. Are you okay? Go and take a rest, let me take care of this. Be careful. l found the money. Hui is dead. Let's go, the cops will be here soon. Why didn't they come out? Buddy, your wife is in my hands. Let's talk business. Let go of my boss and i will give you back your wife. Bastard. Shit, I will blow your head off. Shit! Calm down! Calm down! Let me go. What if you kill me? You won't get any money and your wife won't come back either. Let's do business. How is the boss? He's been sitting for four hours. He is in deep remorse. How can he fall for the setup so easily? At that time, Sam was probably in the house. He used to be mad at himself whenever he lost to his opponent. Sam Ho. You don't have to look for me. You know me so well. lf you want your daughter back, you have to cooperate with me. l won't bargain with criminals. You already lost your wife. Do you want to lose your daughter too? What do you want from me? My little brother and your wife were both murdered by ice. Didn't you get him already? My woman is in their hands. l hope you can help me. l told you l won't bargain with criminals. You'd better think it over. In helping me, you also helped yourself. Okay, i will help you. But you have to do as l said. That cop promised to help me... No matter what, tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.... You put his daughter on a taxi to take her home. This is your passport. And this is my Swiss bank account number. You can't stay in Hong Kong. You have to come back. l won't leave until I see you. You are the one who kidnapped my boss? Cut the bullshit. Where is my boss? l have to see my men first. Okay. Come out. Let's exchange 'prisoners'. Okay. Don't play games with me. You know what we've got. Don't let him run away! l want to torture him. You do love her, don't you? l want you to see how your beloved one dies. Shit! Go down and rescue them. Lock them up. Yes, don't move. You are safe. But now you are under arrest. l want to go to hospital. Can you walk? Come down first. Hold on me. Don't move. Put down your guns. Don't move. Put down your guns. Don't move. Don't come near. Don't move. Sorry, I have to save my husband. Brother Mann, Can has escaped, Rocky went after her. Block all exits. Yes. Give me five minutes. Wait. Watch out. Gundam... You just run. Go back and take Eva with you. The money...I give it to her. No... l won't leave you behind. l will never leave you behind. Don't move. You? Don't force me to shoot. At the back. You never thought that. l do want to blow your head off. But you are lucky that l have to keep you as hostage. Put down your gun. You put down your gun or i will kill him. Kill him. Don't mind me... Put down your gun. lf you shoot, l will kill you first. What's going on? We are the Police. You can't go inside. l am the daughter of lnspector Cheung. You can't go inside! Miss! Can! No! l don't care! l won't let you die! Put down your gun. Sam! Sam! Sam, get up. Are you okay? Sam! Sam! Sam Ho. Mann Cheung. We finally meet. Having this match with you... lt's my honor Sam is mine. No one can take him away. l will stay with him forever and ever. We will have our own kid. Brother Mann! Clear up the scene. Are you alright? Luckily I have worn the bulletproof vest. Brother Mann, your daughter is waiting outside. Dad. Madam is very beautiful. And the way she looks at you, it seems... Cut the bullshit. l am not. I am a girl too, l know a woman's heart more than you do. Do you believe me when I say she will ask us to have breakfast together? Forget it. lt's true. Brother Mann, let's have breakfast together. We will have a busy day ahead of us. Okay. Don't say anything---let's go.
