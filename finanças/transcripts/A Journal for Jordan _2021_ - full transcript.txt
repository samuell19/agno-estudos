And you don't even live here. - You seeing somebody else? - What? - Are you seeing somebody else? - No. I'm serious. No. I'm not. I would never ask you to give up your career just to follow me. You know that, right? Yeah, I know. I'm not saying this is gonna be easy, but we can make this work. How can you be so sure? I can't. I can't predict the future either, but I know we got a shot at one. Do you trust me? Yeah. Then be my girlfriend. Officially. I already am. [♪♪♪] You know you could've told me that earlier, right? I had to make you work for it. Now it's about to be your turn. Lead the way. Leave them open. Baby. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Hold up. Do you want a ride? Now, you know you don't wanna drive to the airport this early in the morning. It's freezing out. And you could put this one under the tree. - Another one? - This is for Manny. The doorman? It's a Mets hat. He's from Queens. I didn't know you two were friends. We're buddies. Oh, buddies. Bet you didn't know he was a marine. No. He never mentioned it. That's because you two aren't buddies. This is for you. It's a bunch of grandpa music? Hey, that's grown man music right there. Crazy woman. Am I? - What? - Crazy. Absolutely not. - I'm gonna call you when I land. - Be careful. I will. You know, you can leave some of your new stuff here. I can clear out some closet space. If you want. [♪♪♪] [DOOR CLOSES] [PHONE RINGING] - CHARLES: Hello? - DANA: Guess what. CHARLES: Chicken butt. DANA: I'm serious. CHARLES [CHUCKLES]: Okay, what? DANA: We're doing a whole series on race in America. I'm writing one of the stories, and they want me to be an editor too. This is the biggest opportunity they've ever given me. CHARLES: Hey! Congratulations. DANA: But if I don't nail this, my career at the Times will literally be over. - Woman, please. - No, no, I'm not kidding. They'll fire me. I can't lose this job, Charles. New York is too expensive, and... Stop. Listen, they picked you because you're qualified and you do outstanding work. I'm proud of you. Thank you, baby. And I can't wait to read what you write. I gotta start flying to Akron once a week before I write anything. Not looking forward to that. Okay, well, just give me a couple weeks. Let me get my new soldiers squared away, and I'll see if I can fly down. - Really? - Yeah. I'd love that. [KEYPAD BEEPING] [LINE TRILLING] You've reached First Sergeant Charles King. Please leave a message after the beep. - [BEEPS] - Hey, sweetie. I made it back to Akron. I think all this traveling has got me sick. - Thank you. - Thank you. Anyways, I, uh... I can't wait to see you. Call me later. Bye. [LINE TRILLING] You've reached First Sergeant Charles King. Please leave a message after the beep. Charles, where are you? Starting to get worried. [PHONE RINGING] - Charles? - CHARLES: Hey, baby. - Where are you? - I'm at the hospital. One of my soldiers' wives just had a baby. Well, I've been calling you. I'm sorry. I had to come to the hospital to help him. Help him what? Dana, he's 19 years old. You know, he was scared. He needed me. Well, they don't have phones at the hospital? It was pretty hectic in here. I tried, but I couldn't get away. Well, since when is delivering babies a part of your job description? How about we both get some sleep tonight, and we'll talk about it in the morning? It is morning. And I'm sick as a dog and stuck in Akron, Ohio, waiting for you. I thought you were in a plane crash. I-I'm sorry. I should've called you, but you know I have to be there for my men. And what about me? Your official girlfriend. I haven't seen you in two months. Baby, it's only been six weeks. Okay, I don't think you understand how hurt I am. Dana, his wife had complications. Well, what kind? I don't know exactly. So, you've been there all night and you don't know anything? All I know is that she needed a C-section. Hmm. I see. So maybe you're the one that's seeing someone else. - What? - That why you missed your flight? What? No. No. No. You wanna talk to him? He's in the other room with his wife. Charles, you can get your soldiers to say anything that you want. Come on, Dana, you're talking crazy. Crazy? I have been sitting in a hotel room for hours - waiting on you. - Why would I lie? You did not even bother to call me to let me know that you're not coming. - Relax. - I don't need to relax. We're... You... I can't do this. Goodbye. [CLEARS THROAT] [♪♪♪] - Hey, Manny. - Welcome back, Ms. Canedy. You got a delivery earlier. - I hope you don't mind, I put it upstairs. - Thanks. What are you doing here? Dana, I screwed up. And I'm sorry. No, no, you can't just show up like this. We haven't spoken in weeks. Because you won't return my calls. Because I didn't wanna talk to you. I'm sorry I didn't show up in Akron. You're right. I should've called you that night. I had no idea where you were. Or who you were with. I wasn't with anybody. Dana. Baby. I'm... I'm not your father. I will never be with another woman. I love you. - You don't love me. - I do. No, you love your men. - I'm just better looking. - No. Dana. I love you. I might've given you a reason to leave me, but... I'm never gonna leave you. I love you. I love you too. I'm not going anywhere. You can trust that. Okay? You can trust that. Okay? Okay? [♪♪♪] I love you so much. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You know, it's not a bad color on you. Sometimes I forget you're a soldier. Can I ask you a question? Have I ever been able to stop you? What's combat like? My dad never talks about Vietnam. You never talk about Iraq. To be honest, I don't remember much. Smells. Sounds. Training kicks in, so it's kind of a blur. Were you scared? Of course I was. Have you ever actually killed someone? [SIGHS] How can you be a soldier and believe in God? [HELICOPTER WHIRRING SOFTLY] I believe in evil too. Protecting people who can't protect themselves. [CHANTING] Hard work work! Hard work work!

Oh, my God! - [PEOPLE SCREAMING] REPORTER: Another plane has just hit into another building. I want you to go home and don't leave. Call your parents, tell them not to leave the house. Don't do anything till you hear from me, got it? - Yeah. Yes, I got it. I got it! - Nothing. - All right, I gotta go. - Charles. Wait. - Yes? - Please be careful. You too. - Okay. - All right, bye.

There we go. A little head. Spine. And heartbeat. - Dana, thank you. I love you. - I love you too. You guys wanna know the sex? - Yes. - Yes. - It's a boy. - I knew it. Yes! It's a boy. What's up, little fella? How you doing? It's Papa. [LAUGHS] I knew it was a boy, I knew it. Doc, can you take a picture? - Charles. - Just one. - Sure. - I'm sorry. Say, "It's a boy." BOTH: It's a boy. CHARLES: There's enough money in these accounts, so you can withdraw whenever you need to. My combat pay gets deposited on the 15th of every month. I'm not gonna need to spend much over there, so it's gonna add up. Okay? This is a power of attorney, so you can sign - for military dependent benefits. - DANA: Can I ask you a question? CHARLES: Yeah. Sure. DANA: When people go to war, what do they do about sex? [SCOFFS] I don't know. I never think about it. I'm more worried about getting shot than I am horny. I was just thinking that if you need sex in Iraq, I mean, to help you get through it, I want you to know that you have my permission. - Have you lost your mind? - I'm serious. - Me too. - If you need human contact - or someone to hold, - Dana, stop. - or to be held, I don't want you... - Dana, stop. Dana, I don't want another woman. And I'll never disrespect you or my son like that. I hope you don't expect me to extend that same offer because you better keep that shit locked up. [LAUGHS] - Shut up. - I ain't laughing. Okay. I want you to keep this some place safe. Just in case something happens to me. Nothing is going to happen to you. I know, but I don't want you to worry I got you something. about funeral arrangements or anything like that. - What's this? - It's a journal. So you can write to your son. Even if it's just a page or two. Open it. [♪♪♪] I, uh... I don't know what to say. What do I write? Well, it's especially for dads, so there's some questions to get you started. Tell him who you are. What you believe in. And tell him you love him. Just so he knows. [THUNDER RUMBLING] CHARLES: Jordan, always remember, your thoughts and actions must be open to change and improvement. But your convictions must be non-negotiable. So live by your convictions. And on your journey, if you ever get down and feel like you need to talk to someone, then talk to the one who can do something about it. - Mom. Mom. - Yes? You said my dad couldn't come home when I was born. - No, sweetie. - Why not? CHARLES: Ma, can you hear me? DANA: Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you. Hi, baby. Hey, baby girl. How you doing? I'm, uh... I'm good. Hang on, hang on. Say hi to your son. Hey, what's up, soldier? A-ten, hut! - Oh, he's kicking. - He's kicking? He hears you. He hears you. Yeah, he know Daddy voice. - We miss you. - I miss you too. How are you? Well, "gainfully employed" would definitely be an understatement, but... Sorry I haven't called you. Mm-hm. It's been three weeks. Where are you? I wanna look at it on my map. You know I can't tell you that. Thank you for my pictures, though. You look beautiful. I mean, shit! I'm loving the belly. Yeah, it's easy for you to say. You're not the one who has to carry him around. It's true, it's true. - Can't wait to meet him. - You and me, both. You know, hold him. Which reminds me, you need to tell me when you're coming, so I can set a date to be induced. Yeah, uh... I don't know yet. Well, you must have some idea. Haven't you put in a request for your leave? No. Not yet. Well, you're cutting it kind of close. What are you waiting for? Charles? I don't know. You don't know what? Charles? Yes, ma'am. What are you telling me? Let's go, let's go. Move it, come on. You're not coming, are you? Hello? Ma, I just need you to please, just try to understand. We got in country a couple months ago. - I can't do this without you. - My guys are not... - No, Charles, you promised me. - Things change. - But you promised me. - We adapt. That's what we do. I'm having your baby. I'm responsible for an entire company. If my men got killed while I was gone, I wouldn't forgive myself. That can happen whether you are there or not. It's not like I'm asking you to go on a cruise. - I can't do this. Just breathe. - Charles, please. - You promised me. - You know I love you. - We need you as much as they do. - I love you so much. - Give me some time. - Please, Charles, I am begging you. - Charles? - I love you. We're moving out. - I gotta go. I'll call you soon. - No. Don't get off this phone. - Charles? No, no, no. Charles? - All right. [YELLS] [♪♪♪] CHARLES: Son, I couldn't be at your birth because of the war. And I hope you and your mother can forgive me. Every time I roll out of that gate, I pray I don't run out of time. Time with you, time with your mother. So much to do, Jordan. But I have faith that you are safe and sound. Because you're surrounded by strong women. These are your first teachers, little prince. [SCREAMING] And all of these women embody the reasons you should never, ever disrespect or lay your hand against any woman. The woman you choose to be your partner should guard your friendship first, son. DOCTOR: You're doing good, good! LIEUTENANT COLONEL: Company, attention! CHARLES: And just like you, she should be honorable. And take pride in how she carries herself. But remember... Here we go! Here we go, push! ...beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Roll call! And real beauty comes from deep inside. He's here. He's coming, he's coming! PFC Coats! Here, first sergeant! - Private Bryant! - Here, first sergeant! Just take one look at your mother, and that'll tell you what I think beautiful is. [JORDAN CRYING] CHARLES: Corporal Light! Corporal Robbie Light! Corporal Robbie Glen Light!

I know, Daddy's home. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Someone else thought I was his nanny today. He's so light-skinned, no one thinks he's mine. He just gets that from my mom. - So you know what I did? - What? I pulled out my boob and I breastfed him right there, in front of her. Lucky I didn't squirt milk on her little punk ass. Guess I gotta get you a ring, then. [COUGHING] Man, white people, they won't think twice. - Are you all right? - Yeah. It's just asthma. Since when do you have asthma? Our base is by a power plant. Doc said I probably got it there. It's nothing. - Are you sure? - Yes. Don't worry about it. But I'm serious, though. I can get you a ring. We could do the whole thing while I'm in town. What whole thing? Jordan could be my best man, we can get him a little tux. - You mean get married. - Why not? No. I don't wanna cram our whole lives into one visit. I want a real wedding. With white calla lilies, and flower girls in tulle dresses. - What kind of dresses? - Tulle. And look, you've got six weeks left. I can wait. Then so can I.

All right? [THUNDER RUMBLING] JORDAN: You know, technically, he didn't free the slaves. They freed themselves. Did they? The Emancipation Proclamation only applied to Confederate states, but it also allowed Black people to join the Army and help win the war. Someone's been paying attention in history class. How did my dad die? I told you, baby. All you said was that a bomb exploded. I wanna know what happened. Your father was a part of the First Battalion 67th Armed Regiment from Fort Hood, Texas. [♪♪♪] They called themselves the Death Dealers. Which was fitting because most of their missions in Iraq took part in a place the military called "the Triangle of Death." Your dad's nickname was Top, because of his rank. He was in charge of 105 men of Charlie Company. Their nickname was the Carnivores. Your dad's job was, and I quote: "to teach them to stay alive and kill the enemy." On October 14th, 2006, he took them on a mission. He could've stayed behind that day. He even let his battle buddies sleep in. But your dad would never ask his soldiers to do anything he wouldn't do himself. He went where they went. Let's move out. [SOLDIERS WHOOP] DANA: That's the kind of man your dad was. - It's go time, Imhoff. - Cherry, let him know. Load up! [SOLDIERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] We trust in you, oh, God. We trust in you in the name of the Father and the Son, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. DANA: Their mission was to re-supply a place called the Island. It was an isolated spot where about 60 soldiers were posted. At 10:38 in the morning, their convoy passed a place called Jurf Al Sakhar. It was about two miles from the Island. [♪♪♪] [WIND WHISTLING] - SOLDIER 1: IED! IED! - SOLDIER 2: Return fire! SOLDIER 1: Light it up! Light it up! [SCREAMING] Imhoff! Drop, drop down. Cover the rear! Cover the rear! Return fire!

What's going on? Wait. I'm sorry, what happened? He didn't... He didn't make... [EXHALES SHARPLY] No. No, no, no. Where is he? No, where is he? Tell me! Where is he? - No! No! - [SHUSHING] No. [DANA SOBBING] No, no. No! No! No! They had a plan in place. A secret plan, in case something happened to your father. He didn't want me to be alone when I heard he was gone. Why were we even fighting that war? Well, that depends on who you ask. Some might say we were fighting to free a country from a tyrant and stop terrorists. Others might say we're the reason they became terrorists in the first place. But I bet if you asked your father, he'd say he was fighting for his soldiers. To keep them alive and to get them home. But he had to die to do it? Well, that's what heroes do, baby.

[♪♪♪] - What is this? - I sent an e-mail. It went a little viral. More people wanted to come, but they couldn't make it. - Jordan, why didn't you just ask me? - Mom. - Hi, baby. - Hi. How are you, pumpkin? Oh, my God, I can't believe you guys are here. Hi. You helped him with this? He wanted to surprise you. It worked. Excuse me, everybody? Can I have your attention? Mom. Thank you all for coming. Some of you came from pretty far. I'd like to read this. It's from my dad. "Family means everything, Jordan. It's why I wake up in the morning. It's why I put on the uniform and risk my life. And the great thing about family is that when you get older, you get to choose who's in it." He underlined the word "you." "So choose wisely. Surround yourself with people that love you for you and love them back. Because love is the one thing in this world that's worth fighting for." So I guess that makes all of you my family. Mom. Since you never got a flag, my dad would want me to make sure you got one. Private Imhoff, Private Mohammed. [♪♪♪] On behalf of a grateful nation and Charlie Company, we wouldn't be here if it weren't for Top. None of us would, ma'am. This belongs to you. DANA: Dear Jordan, when your father died, I thought my life was over. But the truth is, it was just beginning. You and your dad both showed me how beautiful life is when you live it below your neck and in your heart. Risky place, the heart. Because it's fragile, so it breaks. And it hurts. After your dad left, I tried my best to feel nothing so my heart would never break again. But even pain is better than nothing. Because without pain, it's impossible to find joy. I hope these words will help you understand the remarkable love your father and I shared. I want you to have that kind of love, Jordan. The kind of love that does not ask her to be anyone other than who she is. And that does not ask any more of you. T.J.: Dear heavenly Father, thank you for bringing us here as family to honor the life and remember the life of Charles Monroe King. DANA: My prayer for you, Jordan, is that you carry with you the knowledge that you will always have two parents guiding you. But my mother's intuition alone will not be enough to teach you to be a man. For that, I give you your father's journal. And the wisdom it contains. Its pages should give you an idea of where you came from so you can decide on exactly where you're going. I love you, son. Always and forever. Mom. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
