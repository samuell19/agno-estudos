I just love what you did here. You know, just blowing the background out and keeping her in focus. It really makes a statement I think. And we'll do it in black and white. Like a whole monochrome thing. I think all we need now is a really strong lead in. Something on the, uh... light side, though. Because this is very kind of powerful, - already overwhelming. - We don't want it be too heavy. - We talked about that. - Sorry. Sorry I'm late. - Oh, God! Fabulous. - Thank you. So raw. It's like I can see who she is just from the photograph. Mm-hm. Like right there it's like her soul. - And I'm just looking into it. - They're never the same after their first big story, the innocence is gone after that. She hasn't been innocent since she got to four million Instagram followers. I love what you do with her eyes. 'Cause she has such beautiful lashes, you know? It's what her following loves her for. It's what she's known for. That and her overbite. Which I think was so perfect for this setup. ¶ Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me ¶ ¶ I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed ¶ ¶ She was looking kind of dumb with her finger ¶ ¶ And her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead ¶ ¶ Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming ¶ ¶ Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running ¶ ¶ Didn't make sense not to live for fun ¶ ¶ Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb ¶ ¶ So much to do So much to see ¶ ¶ So what's wrong with taking the back streets? ¶ ¶ You'll never know if you don't go ¶ ¶ You'll never shine if you don't glow ¶ ¶ Hey now, you're an all-star ¶ ¶ Get your game on, go play ¶ ¶ Hey now, you're a rock star ¶ ¶ Get the show on Get paid ¶ ¶ And all that glitters is gold ¶ ¶ Only shooting stars break the mold ¶ ¶ It's a cool place and they say it gets colder ¶ ¶ You're bundled up now Wait till you get older ¶ ¶ But the meteor men beg to differ ¶ ¶ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture ¶ ¶ The ice we skate is getting pretty thin ¶ ¶ The water's getting warm so you might as well swim ¶ ¶ My world's on fire How about yours? ¶ ¶ That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored ¶ ¶ Hey now, you're an all-star ¶ ¶ Get your game on, go play ¶ ¶ Hey now, you're a rock star ¶ ¶ Get the show on Get paid ¶ ¶ And all that glitters is gold ¶ ¶ Only shooting stars break the mold ¶ The National Influencer is really the Vanity Fair or the People magazine for the modern day celebrity. Celebrity obviously meaning people with large - social media followings. - Mm-hm. Someone does a lip synch number with their family. Um, gets a million views on YouTube. Someone manages to, you know, light themselves on fire. Not quite get hurt, yet have it go viral. - That was a great spread. - Yeah, The National Influencer - went public after that one. - Yeah. It did. And we're the ones who break those stories, who cover those stories and those characters. It's so important those stories are told. Absolutely. And we're proud to be going on five years here at The National Influencer. Um, and we're currently in the midst of working on our fifth anniversary issue which we're very excited about. Yeah. Fifi the Frenchie was really just the Cinderella story, you know, of the issue. She's the up and comer. - Where did she come from? - And she's only at four million Instagram followers. But you know numbers aren't everything. No, we don't hold that against her. - No, we like an underdog. - And the pun was good for the story as well. Fifi's involvement was so important because it really just humanizes the issue. Um, that being said, Fifi did not make the cover of the anniversary issue because the cover of the anniversary issue are the real stars of the show. It'll be the top five social media influencers, all who have over ten million followers. So, you know, get ready, hold on to your hats, yeah. I'll be doing the shoot, actually. And I plan it to be very Annie Liebovitz style. - Yeah. - It'll be obviously group photo shoot with these five influencers. Mm-hm. We're calling them the Social Ones. And our goal, you know, ultimately is to just kind of peel back the layers on these five sages, so to speak. There's so much more to them than meets the eye. - So much more. - And the iPhone. There's Dan Summers, the king of Snapchat. Hey, y'all. Top of that tree in ten seconds. I know I have 60 seconds for this snap, but I'll do it in ten. Brenda, start the timer. Let's do it. Come on! Oh! Whoa! Yo, it's silk. It's 100 percent silk, so I'm just flying, that's all. Let's get it. My grippies, grippies! Come on! Twenty-five million followers. It's hard to really explain what he does. He's just Dan Summers. Oh! Cut it, that one's good though. That one's high. And then there's the fashion Instagram star, JosieZ. Wow. Incredible. What is this look, 45 for today? It's actually 43. - There she is. - It looks so-- - There she is. - Probably looks so good. - Just get down there. - Yeah. - Whoa! - I like that. Probably a little better if I was doing it, though. Right? - No. - Just completely on the pulse - of couture. - Completely. Uh, Dixie Bell, who is the goddess of viral food. Yes, Instagram, yes! Want that ready for YouTube in two minutes! Okay. We talked about this yesterday. And the day before. If you do not understand how to combine a deep dish pizza and a donut to make a beautiful hybrid dessert... I don't know how to talk to you. I don't know how to talk to her! - No vision! - Making quick food images and videos shareable and viral is her expertise. Yeah. Completely. And then there's the vlogger, Jane Zap. She has a good presence on Facebook. What? This is a bowtie? Uh, we need a blazer and some pants. This is just so unrealistic for a red carpet Instagram event. I'm just-- I'm just not really sure... Um, hey, Karen? Do we have any other options for Clementine? He looks like he's going to the gym. It's not always clear what her angle is, but her photos and videos of animals dressed in costume always get great engagements. Uh, and last but certainly not least, the meme god, Kap Phat Jawacki, with 19 million Instagram followers. Me sending a new meme out into the world. How will the people be impacted? It's always a roll of the dice. Boom! What a get for this issue. He is just so versatile. He's not just a meme god anymore. He's completely expanded his brand. He's the new face of Clinique now. - No? Wow. - And Pampers. What you're doing on social media is who you are. - That's you. - I could not have put it better. You hit the nail on the head. - Thank you. - Yeah. Engagement. It doesn't mean marriage anymore. - No, not in the slightest. - What does it mean? - It means shares, views, reach. - Likes. - Horse likes. - Comments. - Even negative comments. - Any comment will do really. Even a letter. We don't know how these influencers do it. These are the gods of today, really. These are the 21st century deities and that's why we've been telling their stories for five years now. What do you say to a guy with 19 million Instagram followers? Where do you even begin? It would be a bit like casually approaching Gandhi at a dinner party. What's the icebreaker with someone like that? Someone like Kap Phat Jawacki has a way of Instagramming where the Instagram just becomes immortal. They're modern day poets. And there have definitely been one too many times where, you know, episodes do happen for me. - Anxiety attacks. - They're not quite anxiety attacks, just more like 30 minutes or so at a time where I can't breathe or I feel like I'm gonna die or there's an elephant kind of just sitting flush on my chest and he's not getting up. Anxiety attacks. As we covered more people, you've gotten more comfortable. She's gotten more comfortable. It's true. I mean, how do you get to Carnegie Hall? After five years, the elephant's become more like, you know, kind of a hippo or a small Buick. - Right, you said that last time. - So that's an improvement. We do always bring Xanax to shoots with us now. - Miracle stuff. - Yeah. Um, but this group photo shoot is set to be our biggest story yet. All of these influencers will be... - Mm-hm. - ...in the same place... - Mm. - ...at the same time, Come April 10th. And we are prepared for that. - Right? Um... - Yeah. - We've even been-- - Excuse me. Just... just need to get a snack. We've even brought on experts, um, on the periphery of social media to be part of the anniversary issue. Just as to give all of this context. People say social media is fast, but its history, its ten to 20 year history is in fact slow. What I'm here to do is break down the theory behind being, as they say, social on the world wide... on the world wide web. Now, we've grasped what a "like" is. But can anyone tell me what... is... a... share? Anybody? Hot. Well, it is true that I haven't had as much time as I'd like to... to build my own followings. I certainly am an expert in social media theory. They've not yet awarded doctorates for the subject. But if they did, I would no doubt have one. A, uh... a PhD. I actually preemptively asked friends and students and colleagues to call me Dr. Schpelnick, just take your questions to the doc. I'll show you this function. Press the home button and the power off at the same time. You got a screenshot. What I really care about is what I'm teaching... these kids. They need me. All I can do is give them the tools. After that, it's, uh... it's up to them. Don't forget that fashion can also take nature into account. See that? Wingtips. Oil is our enemy. You wanna have everything be completely matte. Most meditation practices say "tune out, shut off, don't let anything come inside." I say no. I say let it all in, because if your phone rings, you gotta know. I don't know what people mean when they say you have to do crazy things to get followers. You just have to be your authentic self. That's what social media's all about. What would you normally wear on any given day? What do you throw on? You know, what would you do on any given day? This is as high as it goes. Fashion beats range of motion. That's what you wanna chronicle. Your followers will know if you're not being real with them. I'm gonna lay here, and then this shot needs to be up from a window, higher up, like fourth story at least. - Up there. - My nose job is fresh. I know how I want it to look. It needs to be an aerial view. Sure. Just that window, right up there, huh? Benjamin, I hear hesitation in your voice. - Oh, no... - And when you hesitate, I hesitate because you're hesitating. Okay! Scale away, Spiderman! Ever since my last intern shattered both her collar bones while she was shimmying up a fire escape, clumsy gal, I make all of them sign waivers before they start working with me. Because they may look sturdy, but they may not be. It's not that I don't care about their bones or their bodies or that I'm deliberately putting them in danger. I would never do that. So there's got to be a way we can get the shot from inside of the oven shooting out. So it's like I've just baked something and I'm pulling it out of the oven. It's the food's point of view. I wanna see what my pie is seeing. - So just... - In the oven. Okay. Sure. If they want to live the life, if they want to have in the thousands of followers, then they need to learn from me. They need to follow my lead. I consider my internship with Josie to be the single best thing that has ever happened to me. - So... thank you so much. - Okay. - Thank you. - Stop it. I started an Instagram story series following the progression of my arms and hands. The recovery. - So every morning, I... - Okay, let's take it... I peel the bandages off and... - Pick up the pace. - And then I take photos and videos and people are just loving it. - It's disgusting! - But it is very shareable. - My-- - Tell them what your follow account is up to. Remind me. Tell them. Since the burn series, I'm at about 11,000 followers - on Instagram. - Eleven thousand. When he first started with me, he was at 11. And six of them were bots. Ow! Ow! Ooh! Think of how many followers he'll have when he can use his hands again. Uh, yeah, cross my fingers, you know, it'll be about six months and it'll just be... - back to normal. - I'll cross 'em for you, Ben, 'cause you can't. But Ben, it's more like a year, maybe two. The doctor did say it could be two full years like this. So we've developed a special selfie contraption so we can keep posting to my social outlets. Content does not sleep. We can't post less due to some skin grafts. Unbelievable! Let's go over to black and white now! - Do I need more contouring? - God, no, your cheek bones look incredible, like they could cut steel! Cut steel. That would collapse a building. - Yeah. - Get closer. Closer. Closer. A little closer. A little closer. That's where my audience wants me to be. Nose to nose. Yo, this moss is really susceptible to moonwalking. The biggest star of our anniversary group cover shoot is, no doubt, Dan Summers. Oh! Master Snapchatter. Also has a crazy YouTube presence. He is just completely dedicated to his craft. Maw! But-- Fuck, man. Ah! Yo, Brendan, they didn't explode like you said they would, but... Just coming to you from my neighbor, Mr. Radley's, house. I'm gonna juggle in his house while convincing Mr. Radley there's a fire in his home! There's a fire in your house! Oh, my God! Oh, people are dying out here! He's like 90 years old! Dan. - Dan, hi. - Hi. - Huge, huge fan. - Oh! Your most recent YouTube video where you sat on the couch and, um, oh, God! In real time, reacted to videos of other people doing extreme sports was... oh! It was genius. - Thanks. - I mean, I don't know how you come up with stuff like that because, you know, I myself am also a content creator. - So when I try to create-- - Andy! - Yeah? - I need you to post the tweet - about the stylist. - Okay. I will. - So, um, when I try to-- - Now, please. Hold that thought. I will be right back. What the... Refresh! You are arguably one of the biggest Snapchat celebrities. What's the definition - of good content for you? - Unique. And what would your advice be to those trying to create great content on social media? Deliver. Could you elaborate on that, Dan? Dan doesn't provide more than one word answers, unless it's on social media. In the worst case, he'll give an answer that's exactly 60 seconds long. That's the maximum length of a Snapchat video, but that's more for philanthropic or political issues. Issues he truly cares about, or real life encounters. Life or death situations and stuff like that. Like serious situations. No, literally life or death. Uh, Dan was mugged at gunpoint last year, and only exchanged 11 words with his mugger. He Snapchatted the whole experience, of course. I'll be in the back. Understood. Um, do you have a second favorite social platform? Instagram, maybe? Do you like Instagram? I... was told I was not gonna be asked about Instagram. - Dan doesn't-- - Yeah, I don't talk... about Instagram! Okay? Do your fucking job! My mom was right about you! That stories bullshit? Where you think they got it from? From me! Fuck, man! Fuck Instagram! Fuck Instagram! Fuck Instagram. You simply can't ask a social media influencer about a following they're not as strong in. If a person has two million Snapchat followers, but a million on Instagram, well, that isn't something they're going to want to discuss, or even share for that matter. I've seen the case many times. It all happens right here in the cerebral cortex, in this point in the frontal lobe. This is where emotions, reasoning, and planning are associated. And when a person has stress or anxiety about a low Pinterest following or negative comment on Facebook, well, that activity, it happens right here. And when a person has a significantly weaker following on one platform, it creates a kind of frenzy that moves throughout the frontal lobe. It can lead to anything. Anxiety, depression. I've seen it lead to hospitalization. The point is, you have to know these people's follower counts before you interact with them. It's crucial. And I would give this advice to anyone who's in the same building as an influencer. It's an entirely different ballgame, dealing with these people. You have to be sensitive. You have to take care. We've been a bit stressed because no one has heard from Dan Summers. - He officially stopped snapping. - Eleven hours ago. - Wild, wild stuff. Yeah. - Basically stopped. Um, so as you can imagine, we're in the midst of some contingency planning here at the magazine. I'd say a lot of contingency planning. Yeah. - Has he done this before? - Only when he was, you know, protesting the length of a Snapchat being extended from ten seconds to 60 seconds. But then he was still posting ten second videos on YouTube - every ten seconds. - The ten on ten wave. He really moved the needle there. - Hey, Andy? - Yeah? What's next on the Instagram queue? Todd... ler. I need more information than that. There have been like 11 toddler memes this week. - Why... - What am I missing here? He's trying to do that one word answer thing - that Dan Summers did. - Is that supposed to be commemorative? I don't... And also writing the sentence down is exactly the same thing as speaking it out of your mouth. - Yes, it is. - You're giving me anxiety which is a very easy thing to do, but still. Leave. Exit. Thank you. Oh, my God. Yeah, so is texting it to my phone. Texting it to my phone is the same thing as writing it down. News alert. You're officially fired. Oh. Okay. No, it's, uh... it's a Dan Summers news alert. - And? And? And? - Um, well, he... he sort of checked himself into a hos-- - Oh! Oh, God! - It's the one upstate. - They have Pilates. - Yep. This is very disconcerting! Very disconcerting! God! Rob is very sensitive about our interview subjects. Yeah. There was... an incident a few years ago. - Yeah. - We're not supposed to talk about it, we don't go into it. - Exactly. - Injunctions of any kind are hard when you're trying to run a publication. - Is this not talking about it? - Just the detail. Side note. Great. Anyways, we don't wanna be responsible for driving - anyone insane. - No. Especially someone with 25 million Snapchat followers. - They have a responsibility. - Yeah. Uh, so once the dust settled, we went to see Dan after he got out of the hospital. He's living with his mom temporarily. Doing very well. Um... He's been off Snapchat for a full week now. But doing well. Sure. Wow. A CD player. How retro. It's true, I really loved those growing up. I didn't love those growing up. I always use the word "retro" when I see something - I haven't seen before. - She does. So listen. I know we didn't quite get what we needed - for your individual story. - This would be... a very interesting angle. Okay. We would still love for you to be part of the group shoot. Right? I think it wouldn't be the same without you. - She speaks for both of us. - Mm-hm. I do. We talked to your mom upstairs, and, uh, told her all the details, the shoot's in two weeks. She's gonna, you know, drive you. And, um, until then, you know... you... you just take some you time. Or, uh... whatever-- whatever it is that you need to do. It's very common after an influencer experiences a breakdown for he or she to procure a very serious case of AND. What we in the mental health space call it, it's Acute Nostalgia Disorder. And the subject can revert back to a time where he or she thinks is... things are slower, things are simpler. And that can manifest itself in a variety of really disturbing behaviors. Anything from playing Mario Kart all day to going to arcades, buying DVD players, searching for the last remaining Blockbuster video store. Sometimes the subjects have physical posters in their rooms of '90s boy bands. Anything from NSYNC to Backstreet Boys. And in the more serious cases, 98 Degrees. Does it make you angry? Does it make you sad to think about a time that might have been... better than now? I don't know, just like a douche. It makes you feel like a douche. - Yeah. - We have 42 minutes left in our session. We can talk about anything you like. I'd like to talk about... flashcards. - Flashcards. - Yeah. You know, like at school. When you study for a test. And you write. Like you write, like with a pencil. You'd write the answer on one side of the card and a question on the other. Is that something you used to do in school, Daniel? No. No-- no, of course not. My parents once told me about it in a story. It sounds kind of nice. The answer... and the question. You used to use flashcards. Right? Or like floppy discs? I've never even seen a floppy disc. Well, you're lucky. Um, Daniel has a long way to go. And I need to use my knowledge to bring patience and understanding to the situation. Despite what I believe is his sometimes... How to describe him? I... I think the only way sometimes is just he's... He can be something of a shit. I cannot reach the mountaintop. I'm nowhere near the mountaintop. You're very near the mountaintop. No, I'm nowhere near the mountaintop! And if I do not reach the mountaintop, I cannot tweet it. What is that sound? It's like a ticking, it's like a tick, tick, tick. - Do you hear that, Benjamin? - Of course I hear it. It's, uh, it's maddening, the ticking. Yes. How is anybody supposed to get anything done around here? I think you might be famished. I'm going to go get you a Fig Newton. Yes. I'm practically wasting away. - Wait! - Yeah. Benjamin, I think it's more of a Mallomar kind of a day. - I'll get you a Mallomar. - Yes, get me a Mallomar! - That's what I just said! - Yes, yes. I've had two-- Ben, what is it? - Three, actually. - Three! I've had three nervous breakdowns since I started this job three years ago. Which is par for the course, you know. Time flies when you're breaking down. Jobs are stressful. And I'd imagine if you'd ask any surgeon or president, - they'd also agree with me. - Oh, absolutely. And then the third time that I was admitted to the "facility," against my own will, of course, they strapped me down to a gurney and restrained me. My whole body was shaking and I was shouting things like, "I hate you! I'm gonna kill you!" You know, playful things like that. But Ben and I had this very unique moment where we looked at my leather straps mixed with my chunky bracelets. Ben, do you remember this moment? - I love that moment. - It was almost like this very-- - It was very meta. - Meta is the perfect word - to describe-- - Thank you. I said meta. That's why I said it. It was the leather straps mixed with the gold. National Influencer covered it. Stackable is everything. We even got a sponsorship from... - It's true. - What's that-- - What's that little tiny place? - Cartier? Cartier. I love Mr. Cartier. Just in time for my release. It only took Ben about eight months to convince the doctors I wasn't a threat to myself. Or to anybody else. Ha! I like to keep him on his toes. Hi, guys. I like to think in the park. Where do you like to think? Talk soon. Hi, guys. Hi, guys. Hi, guys. Hi. I'm so excited to share what just happened today. I got a whole new litter of new models. I need you to cast your votes. One barrette or... two. Let me know. Love you guys. So what I'm hearing is that you have real feelings of loss, of remorse, that you feel powerless. Mm-hm. Yeah. It's how I've been feeling. The following is just... It's okay, Jane, you can say. The following has just plateaued. Jane, it's important for me to say what I am about to. I think it's gone a little too far. What makes you think that? Well, the dogs are with us at all of our sessions. And they're with you even when you're not vlogging. You said that this building was dog-friendly. - I did. - That's why I chose you. I... I did. I did say that. It's just that I think you could use a little bit of a break. And I don't want you to take this angst into your shoot for The National Influencer. I think this cover shoot is a great opportunity for you to get yourself back out there. It's the litter, isn't it? It's partially the litter. Yes. But let's get back to you. - I could move that-- - Just stay still. Oh-- Right there. Stay. I think it's very, very dangerous territory when someone starts to see their numbers slide. It feeds a vicious circle. They see their numbers slide, they lose confidence, so the numbers keep sliding, so they lose their confidence, so the numbers keep sliding. And they go to greater and greater lengths to hit that high again. It's like an addiction. And first it's animals. And then the animals get smaller. And then there are baby animals, and there are baby baby animals. And often it results in miniatures. Dogs, turtles, what have you. And of course there is a rampant amount of ODAUFI: Obsessively Dressing Animals Up For Instagram. It's probably our biggest fight right now in the medical front, to find a cure. You know, we have run up against PETA on a number of occasions. I think the patients I'm dealing with certainly are coming with benign purposes. Of course, there's no intent to harm the animal. Now, who can say whether or not the animals enjoy being dressed up? I don't think there's a lot of research on that. They may or may not. We don't know. There's a lot we don't know now. A lot we don't know. I'm planking! I'm planking! Being me. It's a lot of pressure. A lot of pressure. The memes. The captions. But for me, I just let it flow. You know? I let my mind run wild. But I also have a system. I can it for you right now. I'm gonna get up now, I'm gonna walk over to this Wonder Wall. Okay? That's what I call it. I call it the Wonder Wall. Come on. Let's see what I have here, hm? Hm... Okay, I got "when." I got the word "when." Hm... And I got "bae." So now I got the phrase "when... bae." First step. Hm! Now, over there... Ooh, do you feel that? Ooh, do you feel that? I'm feeling it. I can't see it, but I'm feeling it. There's something, there's something, there's something jumping out at me about this angry-ass looking penguin! Do you see how angry this motherfucker looks? This motherfucker is cold! Okay. So I got the words "when" and "bae." And I got a picture of an angry-ass penguin. So now I'm working my mind here. Sh, sh, sh... What makes bae angry? What makes bae look as angry as that angry-ass penguin? Ah! Oh! Ha! Bingo! Uh... Strip club. Hm... Oh... Dry cleaners! When bae thinks you at the dry cleaners, but finds out you really at the strip club. And that's how it's done. Hey, Julian! Come over here and stick the pin with the red strong on the wall, I just did it! Julian! I'm not saying there's no such thing as meme gods. Of course there are meme gods. It's just that this meme magic, as we like to call it in the mental health space, I found that it's fleeting. I had a patient, it would just come to him, day after day, meme after meme after meme. He called himself Mofodicktacious. I'm sure you've heard of him. He was a modern-day Hemingway. Just this spartan beauty. Combination of gifts, pictures, phrases. It just came pouring out of him. Each post more viral than the next. And then one day, he just... One day the magic just left. And he... All that raw talent and all of that creative inspiration was just... He would look at a picture of a chubby baby, or a silly picture of Kanye West, or even a Kardashian, and... nothing. I mean, just nothing. It was gone. And then he was gone. He disappeared and no one knows where he went. Glory fades. Glory fades. Okay. Can anyone here tell me what a Twitter war is? An internet troll? As a doctor, I have a responsibility. I can let my students learn to turn the other cheek and only see the bright side and only prepare them for that, or I could prepare them for what's really out there. Just the other day, I posted a Facebook photo that I was quite proud of. I had gotten a new bowtie. I bought it special to wear to my nephew's bris. And I had a very harsh, bullying situation. Or trolling, as it's called on social media. Mother likes to joke. But nevertheless, that wasn't easy to hear. Social media trolling is a huge issue. And we actually uncovered a troll in our publication. - Right, Mia? - Yep. We did a whole undercover expose on trolls for the anniversary issue. Unbelievable undercover reporting. It was like an operation, like a... like a... a sting. - A sting operation. - A sting operation. Yes. This particular troll, she was running a pretty large-scale program out of a basement in Queens. We went undercover, exposed them, closed the place down. Now that we've decided on your salaries, minimum wage split between the two of you, I can show you where you'll be. Julie over there is in charge of trolling the celebrities. Jaime, the models, Sheila, the nighttime TV hosts, and over there is Emily. Emily is completely in charge of the royal family 24/7. Okay. It's... they actually wear the troll costumes? They don't wear troll costumes. - They are trolls. - Hm. And if you two are gonna be covering award season and Lena Dunham, you'll be expected to do the same. - Okay. - Now, ladies, in terms of ventilation, there isn't any. So if at any point you feel like you're going to faint, don't. Don't. Cardboard really ties the room together. - Yeah. - Well, work environments are very important for productivity. - Mm-hm. - Your next break is in three days. I saw a finger not moving. In the industry we're in, you see certain things you just don't necessarily wanna see. - Ever again. - Mm-mm. This one troll, um... The one in charge of trolling the Kardashians, she was understandably a bit feisty, and she just grabbed on to my hair when they found out who we were. Almost pulled a chunk out. Um, but mainly, she just kind of, you know, held on and would not let go. And I'll tell you, that'll... that'll give you anxiety. - Yeah. It even gave me anxiety. - Yeah. I got her off eventually, though. - Yeah. You got her off. - Mm-hm. This is how you make a hybrid dessert, or it could also be a hybrid entree. I invented this. It's called rainbow cake. Put some cereal right on it. Go further with that cheese. More. More. Less. Went way too far. Way too far. Did I tell you to stop? Yes, eggs. Love it. I like where your head's at. Actually, I like where my head's at. 'Cause this was my idea. I think you could run that through the deep fryer one more time, huh? Everybody plan to be Insta-ready in five. Yes, chef! I didn't hear you say, "Yes, chef." Yes, chef. Here at Fattish F.O.O.D. we just stay super focused. We're really just concerned with your six basic food groups. Pizza, burgers, fried hybrid desserts, fried chicken, and stuff stuffed with cheese. Three, four, five... And also... anything you can dye rainbow. That's the sixth one. It's very rewarding work. Um, we're always very happy to see an incredible response in terms of engagement. I want this to be a treat for people! I want this to be a food they come home to after their shitty day jobs, when they're ready to blow their fucking brains out! We do everything really, you know, from... overhead how-to recipe videos to before and after shots of certain foods. For example, just off the top of my head, um, a piece of... un-fried fried chicken versus a piece of deep-fried fried chicken. Did you fry this again? Did you put this in the deep fryer? - Yeah, uh-- - Well, it sure as hell doesn't look like it. In fact, this looks like a piece of shit! Go put it through... at least two more times. I always tell my chefs to think outside the box. A phrase that I came up with. Look, avocados are viral on their own. Just as they are, avocados are perfect. That means you don't have to do anything here. Literally, don't even touch 'em 'cause you'll probably mess it up. Think of something you think you can't stuff with cheese. And realize... there's probably a way to stuff it with cheese. Or, if it's already stuffed with cheese, there's probably a way to stuff it with more cheese. Take the cherries off! We need a strong defense! Defense! No, no! Those fries are not gonna-- Don't let those fries score! Strength and honor! What is that from? - What... - It's from the movie Gladiator! Same things goes for putting an egg on something. Treat bomb. Eggs are viral. Yeah. We actually have our motto right up on the wall. Oh, there. I forgot where that wall was. "You can put an egg on anything." That and YCFA. "You can fry anything." We got a deep fryer right over there. And we'll just throw anything... anything in there, 'cause we are creatives. Gimme an Instagram of a deep-fried Supreme sneaker, I'll give you one million engagements. No big deal. I really admire and respect what Dixie does. Because she gives me such a good jumping off point for some of my memes. Yep. Yep. Like this image she created of these double-stuffed cheese fries that have been fried again, you know? See, I could take that, and I can make this meme like, "When your girl makes salmon, but you all you crave are those double-stuffed triple-fried cheese fries." Wow. Did you see that? I owe a good amount of my posts to Dixie. - Oh, stop it. - Mm-hm. Kap and I, we just go... we go way back. You know, we still collaborate. I mean, it's a process. It's a workshop. - Kap said that. - Mm-hm. And Kap just has a massive... following. And he always-- you know, he... he credits us and tags us whenever he uses our creations. As I should. Hm. When you are collaborating on work of this nature, it is just, honestly, almost impossible... for things not to get... personal. We've had sex. Love between social media influencers is really my bread and butter. Social Submission was no doubt a turning point in my career. It was an erotic novel that was a passion project of mine for quite some time. Sorry. The two characters, or lovers, as I'd more accurately call them, um, never actually meet. Yet they share a, um... a sensual kind of bond that all the social platforms, the many different ways they allow you to engage, only make more titillating. And I was just astounded at the reception it received. I have never thought myself an expert on the couples space. Um, but it led me to write a second book, to major fanfare, entitled Touching... Without Touching. This was more a nonfiction self-help book for those that are more concentrated, focused on cyber-sexuality via social media, versus physical sexuality, which many, including myself, would now say is highly overrated. And this led to major notoriety and some pretty incredible speaking engagements. Anonymous would have you believe that a female or male's basic erogenous zones are areas such as the ears, the cervix, the neck, what have you. An area I proffer they have overlooked... is the fingertips... i.e. the area through which all social media activity stems from. The eyes, the windows through which we see everything, um, such as a tawdry engagement on Instagram. Or a lewd post on Facebook. When I started my practice, I by no means had given any thought to couples counseling. And I only counsel influencer couples. That's my specialty. Because I came to realize these partnerships can be quite volatile. Everything's fine until one party experiences an uptick in his or her following, and then the honeymoon phase is over. Which is a real shame, because honeymoons are a terrific opportunity for viral posts on social media. I just unpacked this amazing blue dress, and I am so excited about it. - I think it makes-- - Hey... - Uh-oh! Hey! - Uh-oh! You have to suffer for your art if you want the shot that's gonna break the world. Just a swipe on the cheek. A swipe on the other cheek. A little bit on the forehead here. Maybe a dab on the chin. What's cooking in the kitchen? Oh! Sneak peek. Bam! - There we are. - There's little old me too. - Look at that. - We love you guys. And we love each other more. Okay. Mika. Can you try and explain what happened one more time? - Just a little bit calmer. - Sure. Um, let me just take myself there again. I had taken a photo of room service on my phone. With a beautiful backdrop of the fireplace. And Kingston asked me, incredibly casually, if I could text it to him. I assumed he wanted it as a memento of our vacation. Go on. So we go to dinner that night. And everything was normal. Same with, uh, sex. Everything was, um... fine. So then I wake up. And... Kingston had posted the photo to his Instagram account. - Did he tag you? - No. He didn't. And what did Kingston say when you confronted him? Well, let's see. He offered to take it down. But I think at that point, he knew that those were empty words. I mean, the damage was astronomical. It was already up to 300,000 likes, 4,000 comments, I mean, poof! Gone. I truly didn't think that she was planning on posting it. Okay? She had already done a breakfast shot that trip, and I mean, yes, yes, yes! Yes, it was a little bit different. - But it was still eggs. - Okay. You know, you have two egg shots, like right next to each other. I mean, I don't know. It just, it looks a little lazy. - Are you kidding me? - I think it looks lazy. - Are you kidding me? - What is this, Andy Warhol? This is unbelievable. If you had seen it, the first breakfast photo was a completely different filter, ambience, theme entirely. Unbelievable. Yeah, but they're both sunnyside up. So... I'm done. I'm done. You can slap all the brightness filters you want on it. - It's still sunnyside up. - You didn't know how I was going to frame it, okay? The way I frame things is different from the way you frame things. Maybe in that moment, while you were acting from an artistic place, which I totally respect, maybe there's a way to deliver that information to Mika personally, which I know this sounds strange, but without posting it. Maybe tell her how you feel about two eggs being posted at the same time, don't just assume she knows. I was going to tag you when I posted it. I would have tagged you in the photo - that you would post. - I'm not an egg. Kingston, do you generally post food photos? Well, I have a little bit more recently. Um, I have a very, very specific diet, very special kind of diet. It's the keto diet. I don't know if you've... you've heard about this? Well, it's... it's a little exciting, it's a little novel, it's very en vogue right now. No carbs, all fats. Okay? All fats and proteins. Very high in fat and protein. So a lot of cheese. - A lot of, um, you know... - Would you say... And Mika, I do not say this to hurt you. Would you say eggs? - Do you post eggs? - Well, yeah. Well, that's the thing. 'Cause eggs are on this diet. I can show grace for that. I will show you grace. Thank you. Kingston, did you hear that? Mika wants to show you grace. - Uh-huh. - Mika? I think maybe you could show Kingston snacks. Like photos of snacks? I feel like that's just gonna make it worse. Maybe actual snacks. Maybe you could explore this diet, find appropriate snacks, and in that way participate with Kingston in this experiment. This is a creative endeavor you can do together. Like cooking? I wouldn't go that far. You could probably order it. - Oh, good, good. - Like Seamless, I don't wanna... - Okay, yeah. Thank you. - You can do that on your phone. - I have an idea. - I'd love for you to share it. I think, um, sometimes I've seen some couples do a time out symbol. Like, time out. Let's take a breather. And I'm thinking, what if... What if we did a hashtag? Like hashtag, take a breather. - Hashtag... - I feel like Kingston's - thinking about this. - Yeah. Yeah. - Are you open, babe? - Yeah, I'm open. I'm open to talking about that, the "take a breather." I mean, I did that with my, you know, my asthma awareness campaign. So we might have to kind of - switch that up a little bit. - I forgot about that. - That's right. - I will say that tagging is something that I think we need to explore further - in our sessions. - Thank you. And each person's definition of how that is acceptable is different. You're not wrong, you're not wrong. But we're going to have to find a place in the middle. Yes, I think that, about me not being wrong, is a good... is a good take away. - Us. Us not being wrong. - Us not-- us not being wrong. I would never question the sex lives of these influencer couples, who are just all so ever present in all the social platforms. I think, as... Kama Sutra was to the '70s, they are to the 21st century. They hold the hidden keys to a... deeper, more profound exploration of sexuality as we know it. Well, we've been married for about two years? - Two years, yeah. - Yeah. - We actually met on Instagram. - Yeah, it was very kismet. - Yeah. - You know, very meant to be, Romeo and Juliet, stars aligning kind of feel to it. We coincidentally both were at Coachella. Yeah. Of course, I knew who Kingston was. I was following him. He wasn't following me. But I was following him. He didn't know that, though. - I have a lot of followers. - Yeah. Yes, he does. He sure does. He's got a lot of followers. I do! I commented on an Instagram of his that just really... spoke to me. I was rolling at the time. Yeah. - And then he just pounced. - Oh, I pounced. - Yeah. Yeah. - Full on. Yeah. He DM'd me, of course. And it began. We commented, we liked, we pinged, we DM'd. Like back and forth for just eight months. Yeah. We actually didn't meet at that Coachella physically. We only met eight months later, coincidentally at another event. - Yeah. - Mm-hm. - But those eight months... - Best eight months of my life. - Aw! Mine too. - Oh? The whole marriage angle is great for social media. It's the whole reason we're in The National Influencer's anniversary issue, even though our follower counts aren't quite up there as the other influencers - who get to be on the cover. - Yeah. Uh, just to be in the issue... - Not on the cover, though. - Yeah. - So that's... - It's okay. Yeah, no, just us and a French bulldog. - Who we love. - Side by side. Whom we love. We do love. I will say that we did notice, when we got married, we were able to merge our follower counts - to create this bigger number. - Mm-hm. Which was very exciting. I mean, after he proposed, our post-engagement post engagement just skyrocketed. We're always working on the relationship. - Yes. - Always looking for ways to up each other's followings, you know, support each other. I would say that social media's a really good barometer for whatever is going on inside the relationship. Yeah, we always wonder what other couples fight about. Yeah. Like, what else is there? - Uh-huh. - Are you doing a... an Instagram Live of this right now? Oh, yeah, babe, it's right behind you. Oh. Thank God. With social media, these influencers have found new ways, not only to connect, but to communicate. There are so many ways to express one's self and who you are now. It's self branding. And these influencers are the masters of that. You know, everyone has been given the instruments. But they're the ones who play the symphony. It all comes down to craftsmanship. And the complete and total dedication to their craft. It's a case of perfectionism. Pure, unadulterated perfectionism. And they will settle for nothing less. - That's my clementine. - Oh. That's also my clementine. In my hand. Off you go. Hip, hip! Boom! Good one. Got it! Oh, hey, Francesca? Francesca, let me get a green tea latte, cashew milk, three straws, hold the cup. Okay? Jane. Grande latte. Four straws, hold the milk. Hold the straws. Benjamin, we're gonna get some behind-the-scenes shots, okay? Can we move this? I'm gonna move this. Excuse me, sir. You're in my way. What am I wearing? I'll be honest, I find this garment incredibly disorienting. I put my legs through and I found out they were in one... one hole and there was a whole other hole that was empty. What's that supposed to be for? I just guess I put my leg in each one and... It feels wrong, though. What do you think, babe? No. That looks really uncomfortable. Do you have anything else, sir? Yeah, I mean, I actually might've saved the day here 'cause I brought this, which is my chef jacket which I wear every day, but this one's a formal one. It's pink. I mean, of course, I wanna respect your vision, so, you know, you have final approval, of course. But I approve it. We could even leave some of these buttons open to show some of the slip underneath, if that's what you like. I wanna respect your vision, as I said. But I'm just gonna button all this up. Button it right up to the top so you can't see what you dressed me in. I'd say, though, we keep it, we keep the slip underneath, but then we scrap it and we put the jeans that I brought, put this on top, so just to... to recap, we have everything I brought and we're not using anything that you suggested. We're just trying to stay calm here. You know, I'm calm, she's calm. Everybody is calm. Yeah. You have said you're calm a few times. Well, I am calm. My hands are shaking, but my mind is calm as a whistle. No, it's "clean as a whistle." Good, okay. To be honest, we weren't fully aware of what came with all of them under one roof in one space. We're used to tackling them individually, one by one. - Just keep your voice down. - Sorry. Sorry. They're vicious people. They're an eccentric group of people I'd say. I can't feel this half down. I can't feel it. I can't feel my legs and I'm sure that's normal. Oh, it's gonna be an amazing day, right? We have what most would call I'd say the five pillars of society right now. We've got your meme god, Kap Phat Jawacki. Your food YouTuber, Dixie Bell. - Your vlogger, Jane Zap. - She bit me. - She did not mean to. - Yes, she did, she bit me. I tried to touch one of her dogs, which don't do that. And she bit me. Not the dog, the dog didn't bite me. The vlogger, the vlogger sank her teeth right into me. We've got your star Snapchatter, Dan Summers. Hasn't gotten here yet. But we're excited to see how he's doing. - I don't think he's coming. - And your fashion Instagram - star, Josie Z. - You call this contouring? Where are my cheekbones? Ben! - She's spunky. - Yeah. She's spunky. - She's lively. - Vivacious. We and our makeup artist were under the mistaken impression that makeup can only help to accentuate one's cheekbones. Our mistake. 'Cause apparently, like Rome, cheekbones can be built from the ground up with the right makeup artist, which was not first, second, third, or fourth one we've had here today. I have a pretty good feeling about the seventh - that we hired, though. - She keeps saying something - about a ticking. - Yes. Ticking. You know, I don't hear a ticking. She doesn't hear a ticking. None of us hear a ticking. But obviously, we are all saying that we hear a ticking. And now I'm actually... Yeah, there it goes again. I'm starting to hear a ticking myself, so... yeah. - Well, there's... - Get that checked out in my ample spare time that I have. Tell them about prep. Let's change the subject. Let's talk about prep. Let's talk about prep. We are making sure to keep separate any two influencers who might have a strong following in the same platform, because that could be just a little uncomfortable. So we put Jane Zap and Josie Z together. And Dixie Bell and Kap together. Fat Ben Affleck! Santa Claus! - He's been doing that all day. - Yeah, every 14 minutes or so, I'd say he yells out like a certain combination of things. Sometimes it's an unhealthy food item and a rapper, or, you know, a politician and a porn star, and a character like Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, any of the Muppets really. He says it about cheese fries a lot as well. - Yes, yes. He does. - Chili cheese fries! Where is this ticking coming from? I'm so sorry, we're looking into it. - Go look into the ticking. - There is no ticking. I know. Just do what I did last time. Just get up, go the bathroom, come back, and say you told the guys to work on the ticking. Can I ask a question? Who are the guys? - There's no guys. - There are no guys. - Just... this is fake. - There are no guys. - This is fake guys. - Go get me a sandwich. - Guys? - All right, thank you. Yes, I'd love it to look like an egg. - I want the yolk... - These people are completely incompetent, they're like animals. One of them I heard was saying something so stupid to the other one. They're all stupid. Ben, you're so bad at gossiping. - Hey. - Yes. Hi. - We're starting any minute now. - Dan Summers is in the spread. - That's what I was told. - You were told correct, yes. He is in the spread. He's just a little late. Okay. See, that's what I don't like to hear. If I took a picture of Cardi B, and then I added the word "delicious..." pow! But then I got no picture of a slice of pizza. Hm. What do you think that means? You tell me. I'm never good at guessing games. Um... - I'm trying to-- - It means the story's dead. The meme dream is dead. No Dan, the no me, no story. Okay? He's the only one here who is anywhere near me in terms of follow count. All right? You got me taking a picture with a vlogger with only 10.1 million followers! I mean... That was her. - That was her. That was her. - With the cats... Now, it usually takes me like a minute to catch up to Kap. And, uh, I'm caught up now. So is Dan Summers not coming? 'Cause I thought he was gonna be here. - Here's the thing about Dan - They're trying to pull - something on us, babe. - What's going on? The guys are looking into the ticking. - Ugh, thank God. - Where is Dan? Oh, Dan's coming. He's just a little late. - Right? - Yeah. Yeah. He's two hours late. And if he's not in this, then I am not in this. Yeah. If he's not in this, she's not in this whole thing. I hate memes. She doesn't care for your memes, man. And I don't like girls named after country music bands. - Yeah, fuck you. - Don't even get me started - on animal kingdom over there. - Animal kingdom. Classic. Is that the ticking? What is that? Oh, my God. - What a waste of food. - Now I gotta listen to that and the ticking? This is truly my hell. I mean, honestly, I hate to agree with this very bitter, strange lady. But, I mean, is he coming or not? Because I could be-- You know, I could be - frying something right now. - Yes. Yes, baby, you could. You could be. She could. Well, we-- we haven't heard from him. - But he said-- - They haven't heard from him. - They haven't heard from him. - I'm out. Boom! Oh! Me too! I don't know what they're doing with their hands. Come on, Ben, let's go. This is a waste of our time. Ooh! Now you're in trouble with Josie now. Benjamin, what did I tell you about engaging in conversations - that I am not a part of? - She said under no circumstances ever. You know what? I hope you're all happy. But more importantly, I hope one day I am happy! So Dan Summers never showed up to the photo shoot. - No, he did not. - Yeah. But he did leave us a message to explain why he wasn't there. Not a text message, he left this message on a VHS tape. Do you know anyone with a VHS player? - Because we do not. - No. We don't. We searched everywhere. We searched on eBay. - Craigslist. - Pawn shops. Even checked with both sets of grandparents, and got laughed right out of Shore Hills. Embarrassing. As a journalist, you do have to follow the story. So we went back to see Dan Summers again to get some answers. We wanted to tell his story. Whatever it was. - However bleak it was. - Yeah. We wanted to give him that. Unfortunately, though, - Dan had disappeared. - ...disappeared. He'd gone in search of answers. We found a note that he left. But it was very hard to make out the words. We believe it said "back to the source." Dan Summers went totally off the grid. But more importantly, though, he did what so many of us cannot do. He went on a personal journey just completely unplugged. We soon discovered he actually had our intern Andy - go with him, though. - Makes sense. I mean, if you are going to successfully unplug or do a tech detox, you've simply got to share that - on social media. - Oh, it would be a crime not to. The point is Dan himself is not physically carrying a phone or a tablet on this journey. No. Unless something happens to Andy. Yeah. Something happens to Andy, we would expect that Dan would have to bring the tablets back. Yeah. - Would be a win-win. - Oh, yeah. Come in! - Dan Summers? - Yes. - I've been expecting you. - You know who I am. I know all my chosen ones. Your-- your chosen ones? Anyone with more than ten million followers - on any given platform. - Obviously, I haven't - checked my Snapchat lately. - Oh, please. We all lose our way. But what goes down must come up. Especially on Snapchat. - So what can I do for you? - You are the Architect. The Architect behind the inception of social media since the dawn of it, since MySpace. Don't mention MySpace. But yes. That is who I am. You know, it's about time The National Influencer - covered me. - Of course. They'll cover any millennial Joe, Dick, or Harry worth a tablet. But the one who started it all, the one whose inception it was, the Architect, as you so beautifully put it... - no. - To be fair, I'm not really sure they know who you are. You know, it's typical that they should come to me through you. Ageists. But I digress. So... what do you wanna know? I wanna know why. Why what, Dan? Why are we on social media? Why did it all begin? You've engineered all of this, but why? Well, you might as well ask why do we breathe? Oh. To tell you the truth, Dan, I don't like people. I don't like interacting with people in person. - Mm-hm. - And confrontation. Who likes confrontation? Physical confrontation makes me nervous. - Right, right. - I mean, if my ex-wife cheats on me, and then she goes on vacation with her new husband, I think it's easier to write a nasty comment on her wall than to call her up on the telephone, or God forbid you confront her in person. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's... that's off the record, - that last part. - Sure. Do I talk to you or do I talk to them? Oh, no, no. You can just talk to me. Okay. I wanted to engineer a kind of a chasm, a chasm where people were... they were linked, not through physical interaction, but rather through digital ones. Okay? I mean, that's where the world is going! Who wants to live in a physical world like we're living in today? No! Dan, the future is a digital existence! Okay, but isn't it the physical that makes us human beings? No. No, I think if you pick up a copy of Sheila Burger's Touching Without Touching, you will realize that it is quite oppositely not about the physical. We're engaging with each other wholly and entirely, body and soul, via social media. But what if I want both? You know, to be both a chosen one, but also a physical human being. Do you wanna live in a world where one minute you're the host of Celebrity Apprentice and the next minute you're the most powerful man in the world, where one minute you're OJ Simpson's lawyer, and the next minute you're the patriarch of the most televised family in the history of the medium? Where one minute you have a wife and you have a Labrador retriever, and the next minute she takes the house and the dog and the Lexus-- Yeah, no, I get it. - I digress. - Yes, you do. Quite often. But can I ask you... Can I have both? No, Dan. Do you really wanna live physically in the world we live in today? I'm offering you a key. The chance to escape. My chosen ones will be the first to depart from this physical world. And the rest will follow. - Yeah... no. - What? - I can't do that. - Yes, you can. Um, I'm sorry. I just-- I can't help you. I have to stay. And I have to save what's left of the real. Thank you. No, Dan. Dan, you're missing my point. - Dan, listen. Dan, Dan. - Yeah? Amazon has gotten so big. - Okay. - I can't wrap my brain around it. Yeah, I mean, the brand is definitely-- I-- please, sit. Because I can't understand it. And I need to talk to somebody about this. Okay, sure, but I do have to leave before three. And Alexa, talking to you in your home. Because she can walk your dog virtually. - No. No, she can't. - Yes, she can. - No! - Dan, she can. Where are you reading any of this? Memes. I've been scrolling through memes. And there's this vlogger, Jane Zap. I don't know-- she has the most adorable videos of cats. Little cats and kittens. And she dresses them all up. And some of them go to the prom, and some of them are on a cakewalk, - and it's charming. - I have to go. But if I continue talking about Jane Zap... - I'll go faster. - Okay. Um, thank you so much. It's been a pleasure. - The pleasure's all mine. - You'll email me, yes? - Email? Wow. - Godspeed. Yeah, I'll email you. Okay? I'll email you. You do good work. And you know I'm right. - Maybe. - Don't you argue with me, Dan. - Bye-bye. - Have a good one. Can I help you with something? Just... yeah. - Good? - Sorry. One more. Thanks so much. Love your work. Tag me! Once I found out the Architect's plan was to turn us all into digital bots, switching from the physical completely to the digital, I felt I had to step in. To warn the other influencers to do something. They had to be the ones to lead the way. So I started a franchise of workshops entitled PICW: Physical Interaction and Communication Workshops. What's great about Dan's Physical Interaction and Communication Workshops? Hm. - It's a mouthful. - Yes. Yes, it is. Well, what's great about them is that bae and I... Mm. I mean Dixie and I, because that's her name, you know, that's the name her mama gave her. - After the cup. - Hm. Dixie and I, well, we're learning to communicate with each other in new and authentic ways. Taking what we have going on here to the next level. Yep. - What's the next level? - Yeah, I'm not sure. You know? But it's there. Whoo! It's a level, for sure. Because it's not about the memes or the captions or the food. Mm-mm. - No. - Mm-mm-mm... Mm-mm-mm-mm. - It's about us. - Mm-hm. Yep. That's just what I was gonna say. Word for word. Kap, communicate. Where do you see this going with Dixie? Yeah, where do you see this going? I see it going... There's like a picture of a goat, and then some sort of variation on a pear. Ariana Grande! - Wow. - Kap, what we talked about. Okay? How we practiced it. Okay. Okay, baby. Take those fucking stupid glasses off. Yeah. I should take them off. Dixie... Dixie, I see this going... to a place. Wow. A place. - Yeah. - As I'd planned all along, whatever epiphany I made by going back to the source, that would ideally be the new group cover story for The National Influencer's fifth anniversary issue. That message was lost in translation. Well, not technically lost in translation. Lost on a VHS tape. - But still. - My ball! It works. For this next round, no hands. Speak the ball into your partner's existence. - I trust you. - I trust you. Okay? Now, fall. - That's a little bit scary. - It is. - Scary's good. - Okay. I trust you. Dan's movement has really reminded me to be more mindful of "people." They're people. They're not just followers. And I'm learning to let go of a lot of my rage. Both for myself - and per the court's request. - Stupid judge. I have become so much more aware of how my actions affect others. - Influencers are people. - Who knew? I mean, what Dan has done is amazing. Yeah, amazing, and as he had planned all along, we were making this story, these PICW groups, the new cover of the anniversary issue. The entire issue is dedicated to this topic. You can tell them. We pushed Fifi the Frenchie. Which we did not feel bad about. No, neither of us did. She was just... She was very arrogant. Don't you think? - Very. Um... - Yeah. We were just perplexed because Dan had put this message out to all the influencers, and started this whole movement and we just heard nothing from her. Not a word. She went on posting exactly as she had been. And that just rubbed us the wrong way. - There's no excuse for that. - No. It... You know, to be that out of touch with the people around you is just... - It's just not acceptable. - It's not acceptable. No. But otherwise, I would say... - Yeah. - ...Dan's vision Has inspired everyone. I mean, everyone has been affected by this message. - Everyone has. - Mm-hm. Everyone has. I thought Dan Summers was crazy. When I first heard about this whole movement I was stunned. These new things he was preaching, you know, about... about real life interaction... ah! It-- it was jarring. But the truth is... you know, if you give it some time, some practice, it makes sense. At some point, I said to myself... Steven, doc. You gotta just put yourself out there. I've been on two actual real life dates. Both insisted that I not contact them again. But, you know... My mom gave me this pup. Bar mitzvah present. I was hoping for a bike. I got a ceramic spaniel. She told me its name was Steve. I said, "Mom, that's my name." She said, "It's a coincidence." I have just started working on my third book. Which is definitely largely based on the... goings on in the real world. I... I like to stay relevant. I try to stay young and... And hip. In this book, um, uh... there are certain scenes of... of a more physical nature. So to speak. Sex. Physical sex, that is. Which... is... is definitely out of my skill set. Um... But I happen to think that you don't necessarily have to have experienced something to write about it. I don't... I don't even think you have to have experienced it in your lifetime. That is why they call it fiction. Dan's work has actually been a huge influence on my life. Um, after my breakdown... during The National Influencer shoot, I had to give back all my pets and stop vlogging for a little bit. Obviously. Which is really hard. But actually, the pause helped me figure out what I was really passionate about. And it's origami. Some people would say that it's a lost art. This is my cat. Hey, kitty. Here! She's so cute. Um, and this is a bird. Well, technically it's a parakeet. But with just one shade of construction paper, it's hard to make that clear, parakeet. It's a parakeet. Um, and this is Dr. Spacelli. Uh, looks just like her. Um, and I take her with me everywhere. We're up to five days a week. So that's really helping too. It's just been such rewarding work. It isn't easy, but... we take it day by day. The first step, the influencers. The next step, the people. Because we aren't just social beings. We're human beings. That's the headline. That's the headline right there. Breaking news. - Who are we? - Humans. - What are we not? - Handles. - Who are we? - Humans. - What are we not? - Handles. - Who are we? - Humans. - What are we not? - Handles. - Who are we? - Humans. - What are we not? - Handles. - Who are we? - Humans. Apparently, the girl who was supposed to be the fifth influencer had some sort of a breakdown. - That's sad. - Yeah, it was terrible. - So sad. - But the good news was - once she was out... - We were in. - We were in the cover! - Ah! - Mm! - Yeah! Yeah! We danced around our apartment for like 20 minutes. - I Snapchatted the whole thing. - It was amazing. Ah! Oh, and... we love what Dan has been saying. Oh, yeah. No, it's so important what he's saying about the people who... need people... Yeah, it's very much so. It's completely changed our outlook. - Yeah. - Hey, guys? - Yeah, how's it looking? - Yeah, what's up? This angle, from the side here, is not great for the Instagram Live. It'd be better if you were more centered. Oh. Well, that's not good, Kingston. - Sorry. - Can you move? Yeah, sorry, could you move over for him? He's shooting an Instagram Live from my phone. Look, I'm trying to shoot a documentary, guys. Okay, but this is important. - So move. - Yeah, did I stutter? You're gonna have to move over for him. I'm sorry, buddy. - But you have to move over. - What are you doing? Yeah, we... we still on with that Instagram Live? ¶ Congratulations Your face on a billboard ¶ ¶ I saw it coming round the corner on Sunset ¶ ¶ High as a kite ¶ ¶ High as a kite ¶ ¶ I bet you had a beautiful cocktail party ¶ ¶ With skinny minds and bodies ¶ ¶ Staring at yourself on TV ¶ ¶ And everybody misses you at home ¶ ¶ But I guess when you're in Rome ¶ ¶ Walking with the queens and gods ¶ ¶ You gotta do what the others do ¶ ¶ Just don't lose what they've lost ¶ ¶ Making hay while the sun is shining ¶ ¶ Spending gold while the miners mining ¶ ¶ Your brightest of friends ¶ ¶ Your darkest enemies ¶ ¶ Groomed to your perfection ¶ ¶ Your sunken eyes reflection ¶ ¶ You're staring at yourself on TV ¶ ¶ Staring at yourself on TV ¶ ¶ And I truly miss your soul ¶ ¶ I can't see it anymore ¶ ¶ The prototype's been made ¶ ¶ At a reproduction grade ¶ ¶ Walking with the queens and gods ¶ ¶ Zombies on parade ¶ ¶ Zombies on parade ¶ ¶ Zombies on parade ¶ ¶ Zombies on parade ¶ ¶ Zombies on parade ¶ ¶ Zombies on parade ¶ We're talking about trust.
