DAIEI FILMS THE LIFE OF MUHOMATSU THE UNTAMED Original story by Shunsaku Iwashita, Script by Itami Mansaku Cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa, Music by Goro Nishi Directed by Hiroshi Inagaki Tsumasaburou Bandou as Matsugoro Keiko Sonoi as Yoshiko Yoshioka, Kamon Kawamura as Toshio and Akio Sawamura as young Toshio ISLAND OF KYUSHU, KOKURA, 1897 Hurry up and get home! Get your work done and stop playing around. The policeman will come and get you! Look! A policeman! Is your father home? What a surprise! Bring him some tea. Don't trouble yourself. Look pops, Matsugoro's back I hear. What? Really? It's very hot, work must be tough. Well, is Matsugoro here or not? You'd know better than I. Last January, after all the trouble he was sent packing. I know that. You know I'm not asking about last year. I know perfectly well from a reliable witness... he came back here 3 days ago. One of my men has investigated. Did he get into a fight with someone again? I wonder who. Kid! Kid! Oi! Can't you hear me? Okay, you've got me. I deserve your anger. I'll be honest with you. He's had a burning fever for 3 days. He was asleep until just a moment ago. Where are you taking that? To Matsu? Why does someone so sick want tobacco? Tobacco? For Matsu? Well take it to him. So he was asleep... and now fancies a smoke? I know that doesn't sound plausible but... Look pops, you're in an awkward situation here. But the serious injury, that's completely true! I'd rather die than be suspected of lying. Where are you going? Where are you going? The shop? For Matsu? Six? Six plates? I think you might as well stop pretending. I'm not saying anything. I don't know anything. I just want to know he's here. I'm not arresting him. Don't worry. That's good. So who did he have a fight with? A bad opponent. The kendo instructor of the Wakamatsu police. That's bad. Wow! It's hot! Two, four, six. You've actually had six! So after three days lying on your sickbed... You're famous for both waking up and eating 16 bowls of udon! Matchan here is telling us about his fight... You're in the midst of the story? I can't miss this! So what happened next? Don't mind this idiot, just carry on! I've started, haven't I? So I'll finish. It was around dawn... I'd been here and there without much luck and got to Kurosaki just before dark. Rickshaw man. Rickshaw man! How much to Wakamatsu? Well, let me see... It's a long way around, so 5 kan. 5 kan? Oh, you mean 50 sen? That's expensive. 40! I'm not doing it for 40. 40's more than enough. I'm worn out. Get another rickshaw. Another rickshaw? There aren't any around! Take me, without complaint! What do you mean by laying hands on my vehicle? What the hell are you on about? Don't you realise you have a customer... Nope! Do you think I'd let an idiot like you aboard? Get out of my way! What? Wait! You're in the way! Shift! What! Right! And? Are you insulting your customer? Do you want a fight? You've picked on the wrong guy! I'm the guy that fights to the death! I'm that Matsugoro! - So what! - Well, if we'll fight anyway... he who punches first, often wins. So what happened after? Now it makes sense. Matsu, who do you think the guy was? No idea. He's a senior officer in the Wakamatsu police. - How do you know? - The local policeman told me. He's a professional. Even you would have problems. No wonder it hurt so much! Today's performance is by the Kawamami Sangoro troupe! Let me through! Let me watch for a bit! For free? When we're so busy? No way! Come back after 9. I'll let you in to see one act. You mean I'm not good enough for this production? Really sorry to have troubled you. - But I'm a Kokura rickshaw man. - And? What do you mean? Rickshaw men are always allowed in. I've never heard of us being forced to buy a ticket! Next please! Garlic? That's intolerable! Shall we add some Chinese chives? What's going on? Stop that! It's outrageous! Shut up! You can still watch your show even if it does stink! It's not a kitchen! Go elsewhere! If you've got a complaint I dare you to come here! I'm Muhomatsu the unruly! I paid for my box and I can cook and eat what I want in it! Quite right, sir! Thank you! Thank you for your understanding! Anybody got a problem with that? Lift the lid! Let's put some more on! What the hell do you think you're doing? As you can see, a few bits of food with my sake! It's bothering other members of the audience. We need you to leave. Have you got a problem with me cooking what I like? These days people don't cook in their theatre boxes! - This is no lousy small town theatre! - Take this as a starter! - He's a celebrated local fighter. - What, the little guy? Here comes the Oyabun! He's a big boss. He's a real power in the construction business. Enough! Enough! Look out. He's here! Thank you. Thank you for heeding me. You over there, you said you're called Matsugoro? Piss off! Do you want some too? Under some circumstances I'd be happy to fight you. But I'd like to talk about other things. I am called Juuzou Yuuki. Would you perhaps allow me to sort matters out? First, watching without paying is not a good thing. However... The Kokura rickshaw man's coat was as good as a ticket. That's been the custom. People have kept the custom going... and there's surely good reason for that. And one doorman arbitrarily changing that... no wonder he got angry. That being said, I can't approve your way of dealing with it. I understand your anger. But... But what about all those uninvolved who were unable to watch the show? If the two of you shake hands now, then matters between you are settled. Though there's still the impact on the audience members. Well, what do you think? I didn't realise. Matsu... I apologise. I apologise. Impressive. You dare to say it. I've never met such a clear cut and honest man. Your words alone have almost cleared the debt owed to the audience. I'll sort out the rest. Okay? Needless to say we'll leave it to you. Good! Good! And I've kept face too. Well, I must be going. Let's go! Wait for me! Go for it. He's fallen! He's fallen. He's hurt! That's scary! Here... There you go! Come on. Try to stand up! Come on! Boys shouldn't cry like that! Come on. Can you try and stand? So it hurts here? Where's this kid's house? He's from one of those posh mansions. Kid, what's your father's name? - What? - Kotarou Yoshioka. KOTAROU YOSHIOKA Hello? Come on. Don't cry! What has happened to Toshio? Toshio? What happened? I don't think it's serious but you should probably take him to the doctor. Please take him to the doctor. I'll follow you. ♪ Sakura folk melody ♪ This is just a little something. I don't need it. I see, but please take it for my sake. No, I must earn my money by my work. But my husband will be angry with me. Missus... Even unworthy folk like me sometimes like to forget their status and do something for the sake of others. Well? Does it hurt? Does it hurt? Apparently you cried a lot. I don't cry! You say you don't cry? I wonder! Your crying reached us in the barracks! I only cried a little bit! At last you can admit it! I brought a change of clothes for you. I wish we at least knew his name. I asked around and the lady in the shop told me that. He's from just around the corner and he's called Matsugoro. Matsugoro? - It must be Muhomatsu! - Do you know him? I do indeed! What is it? What's so funny? Well, you'll probably remember that last spring... His Excellency General Okuta came to a memorial for the fallen. Yes, I remember. The one who took him was Matsugoro. None other than Matsugoro. I see. - By the way... - Yes? Can you pour me one? Let's eat! Good lad. And? After he gave a speech to the elementary school students, he was just about to get into Matsugoro's rickshaw. Do you know the destination? I certainly do. Rickshaw man, do you know where I'm going? How many times do you need to ask me? It's rude of you to ask so many times, mate. - Did he say something disrespectful? - No, not at all. I was amazed that Matsu dared to call him 'mate'! Yes, what a surprise. After that he had quite a reputation. I asked around and discovered he's called Wild Matsu. He's quite famous. There seem to be quite a few interesting stories about him. Maybe I can thank him and also chat with him. That's a good idea. Excuse me, is this where Mr. Matsugoro lives? Yes. I'm afraid he's out at the moment though. He should be back any moment. Ah, Mrs. Yoshioka! How's the kid? Thank you so much for yesterday. He's much better. But I'd like you to take him to the doctor again, please. Of course. Let's go right away then. Would you like a ride to the house? I'm fine. It's really close. It's so close it's not worth getting in and out. No problem. Get in! ♪ Shukuzen, a celebratory song ♪ Well, just another one! Don't pretend. You said you would... I will. I will. I will. But with your wife here... It feels a bit awkward... So it seems you dislike me! Then I will withdraw and leave you. Is Toshio in bed? Yes, some time ago. Good. Right, Matsu. Drink some more, Don't hold back! I don't quite know why, but I really like you. I think I'm a bit drunk. Yoshiko, I'm cold. Please shut the window. It is shut. Oh. Excuse me, I'm going to lie down. Of course. Please do. Are you feeling unwell? I really feel cold. That's odd. It's such a warm evening. You're really hot. That can't be. I'm going to get the thermometer. He must have got drenched during training. Tell him he's got a fever of 39.9. I'm sure he'll accompany you back. I'll make him come whatever! And bring a kilo of ice. Perhaps I should come too... No need. I'll drag the doctor here if need be. Please, thank you. It's as if it were a dream. That such a splendid man should die so young. And some worthless creature like me live. Please don't say that, Matsugoro. Let's not speak of the departed. From now on, this one will be my life. And him alone. I think that's right. That's how it must be. But I fear I'm not strong like his father was. I'm not as strong in mind or body as he was. But Madam, the boy's still very young. It's too early to worry about whether or not you can raise him. Really? I wonder if I, a woman, can raise him tough. I'm sure you can. If I had just a little education, perhaps I could've helped you. But I'm just a rickshaw man. I'm ashamed of myself. That's not true at all. I'd like to ask a favour of you. If you have the opportunity, please train him up. I will certainly do whatever I can. It's an important role! I can't fix it straight away. I've just got to take that customer. You stay here and I'll be right back. Okay? Hi! Hi Bon-bon! School finished? It's so cold. Your cheeks are bright red! Normally you'd be hot if your cheeks were that red. They're cold to the touch! What did you do to your leg? This? You'd need to work every day to get your legs as sunburnt as mine. I see. - Does it hurt? - No. - What if I do this? - No, not at all. - And if I do this? - No. It feels as if there's a little fly on it. Right, how about this? Ah, that feels nice. Come on, it must hurt. No matter how much it hurts, I won't burst into tears like you! But you're an adult. I bet you cried when you were a kid. I've never cried. That's not true! Everyone cries when they're little. Well maybe that's true where you come from. I wasn't a cry-baby like you. Well, actually. Just once, I howled and howled. I did cry. Really? Do you want some? - What is it? - Pickled onions. Do you want one? Yuck. I've never had them. Well try one. It'll make you strong like me. Here... try it. Crunch it. And scrunch. You've got to force it down. Is it true what you said? - Is what true? - That you've only cried once. Yes, it's true. It must have been... when I was about eight. My mother. Well, she was my step-mother. Your mother is really good, so you won't understand. She was a really terrible mother. Do you want another one? How about it? One day... I'd been really badly told off, as per usual. I was on the edge of tears, but I managed to contain it. My dad was away in Hirano buying army supplies. It was way off in the mountains. I thought of my dad and I desperately wanted to go and see him. I was barefoot and had no money. So... Do you have udon noodles? We have udon. Is it for you? You can pay after. - But where are you going? - Hirono. - And where have you come from? - Kokura. That's a long way away! This kid says he's going from Kokura to Hirano on his own. You're very grown up for your age. Come here, kid! Why are you going to Hirono? My dad's there. So are you with your mother? I think she must have been angry with you. Am I right? My mum's not my real mum. I thought there might be some reason. I see. Eat up. Eat a lot. Here you go kid. Eat a lot. How wise is he? A child from the city. Eat up. I'll give you as much as you want. Get it down you! Look, there's a kid. What? That's weird at this time of night. That's no kid. It must be a raccoon-dog cub. Kid, come over here. Come inside. Show us your tail! Hey. It's Matsu! What's happened? How on earth did you make it here? Now now. Don't cry. You've made it, so it's okay. No need to cry. It's okay. Come on. What's the matter? I cried and cried. I cried myself to an exhausted sleep. I'll tell you kid, that was the only time I've really cried with every fibre of my being. AUTUMN SPORTS DAY VISITOR SEATING Ready! Go on! Knock 'em over! Weaklings! Chickens! Put some effort into it. Defend it! And don't let go! What are you doing! That's it! Now push! What's wrong? Does my loud shouting embarrass you? All right, I'll stop. Special event! Go and get one for us. Toshio, please go and get one. Never mind. I'll do it. Hey! And one for me! Here you go, I got one for you. Madam, what does it say? "Next is the open competition. A 500 metre race. "Anybody with confidence in their legs can join in." So anybody can enter? Yes. That's what's written here. Well, shall I have a go? Are you a fast runner? I may not have many talents but when it comes to running I'm confident. Can you really win? If you support me by yelling as loud as you can. Is it a deal? Remember our deal! Ready? Hang on, hang on! One more! Ready! Go Matsu! Represent Kokura! Faster, Muhomatsu! Mum! Can he win? Can he really win? Come on Matsu! Don't let him beat you! Mum! Mum, he's won! He's won! Hooray! FIRST PRIZE I've never seen him so enthusiastic. Shouting so loudly. It's the first time I've ever seen him get so excited. I really think his character is emerging now. I'm so pleased, it's made me cry. Thank you. I don't know if what I did is enough to earn your thanks. But if I made you both happy that's enough for me. I must be going. But you're forgetting your prize. I don't really need that kind of thing. I'd like the kid to have it when he's older. I must be off. Well... if you're really sure. No problem. See you! Bye! He's amazing. So fast! I was so delighted when he won. Running fast is not the only reason he's amazing. He had some bad luck so now he has to pull a rickshaw. But Toshio, you're a man, and you should be like him. Have the courage to do as he does. - Understood? - Yes. Let us be rid of the evil! May the gods protect this house. Now run and close the other doors so the demons don't return. Round we go. Demons out! Demons out! Good luck in! It's nothing much but please eat. You're always so kind and thoughtful. Such a treat for me is bittersweet. It's actually you always looking after me. In an army household, a man's hand is really needed. Thanks to you, it's been no problem. You always take him swimming and so on. He's so happy and energetic these days. I hardly recognise him! No, no, I've hardly been of any use at all... TOSHIO YOSHIOKA KOKURA HIGH SCHOOL Come on, you owe it to your classmates and... Keep your voice down. I already told you I would. My mother will be worried if she hears, so speak quietly. It's not just you. No parent would let us out to fight if they knew. Shut up. She'll hear. You go ahead. Very well. You are coming, right? We'll gather just before the lantern march. Hurry up. It's your turn. Toshio, I am looking after you for your father. Don't make too big a deal of it, okay? Please don't do this. Not today. Why try and stop me today? - I've got a bad feeling about today. - That's just superstition! No it's not. A mother knows! You can't know. I can't break my promise. - Toshio! - I won't be long! Is anything the matter? You look really pale. Can you stop him? Well... Can you do anything? I'll try. Who are they fighting? The way they went, I think it's students at the teacher's school. A-ha! That's surely it. You must be right. So he's old enough to fight now, is he! I wish his father could see it! Well... Well, at least he's active. But I'm not quite sure... Don't worry. I won't let him get hurt. - Please. - Understood. Sorry, our game will have to resume later. Here they are! Come on then! Hey! Help! Chicken! Chicken! Why are you running away? Watch this. This is how you fight! I'm home! Welcome back! - So how did it go? - What? Your exam of course. I've applied. Good, good! Kumamoto University is close enough for me to visit. I don't know whether I'll pass or not. You will. There's no way to be certain, mum. You must be confident. Remember your father is always with you. Is there anything to eat? Nothing. Again? You're just like a kid. - Something's bothering me. - What is it? Matchan. Did Matsugoro do something? It's nothing much, but... Hey kid. Hey, Yoshioka kid. Hey "Bon-bon," uncle wants you. Why don't you answer? - Do you want a smack in the mouth? - Hey Bon-bon. Does it really embarrass you to be called "Bon-bon"? But I'm not a little kid. It's fine when we're together but it's another thing in front of my friends. I'll wait for a chance and have a word with him. If you're a man, you've got to be tolerating and let it go. So Bon-bon is embarrassed if I call him Bon-bon. He's too old for that name now. I'm sorry to ask. Shall I call him "young master"? If you do, he'll be even more angry. Oh, right. So instead... Call him Yoshioka-san, please. Yoshioka-san... okay. But it's like someone I'm meeting for the very first time. Yoshioka-san... Yoshioka-san... Are you crazy? He's finally gone. Yes, letting your child leave home is a big moment. Those proverbs really express it well. Soon I'll be all alone. You'll just have to wait. Until the summer holiday. Summer holiday... Summer. Let's go home. Welcome! Hot sake! Hi there. How are you doing? It's hot! Really hot. Hey. It's Matsu! Matsu! Is it you, Kuma? Haven't seen you for a while. What's new? Nothing at all. Like the old days. I'm much the same as ever. Hey, get one for Kuma here. I'd rather not have it hot. I'm hot. You're doing well these days, I hear. Well, not so badly. I've got a couple of young lads who work for me. Had help from Yuki, but it's all because of what you did for me. You're grown up enough to flatter me then. I'm not just saying that. I really thank you. Enough, enough. Are you living in Kurume now? I'd like you to come and visit. I hear rumours about you from time to time. I hear you don't fight or drink or mess about. You've changed, you're no longer Wild Matsu. You'll end up being rich next! Me? As you can see, I'm still drinking. But he's only started drinking again recently. He hasn't been inside here for years. He's always walked past and averted his eyes. Actually, my dad lost his life drinking alcohol. Really? So sake is scary stuff for me. Sooner or later, it will be the same for me. I'll end up having what they call a heart attack. Excuse me. - Is anybody there? - No, I'm here. I was up late last night and had a deep sleep. Can I do something for you? Toshio's coming home. Wow. That's earlier than expected. He said he'll arrive after noon today. And he's bringing a guest. Someone amazing he says. - Well you'd expect his friends... - No, it's his teacher. This isn't the proper, traditional drumming. This is just what they call "kaeru-uchi." This isn't the real thing. So we can't see true drumming any more? It's a real pity. Well, I could try and do a rough imitation of it. Can you play? Hey lad, how about letting me have a go. I'd be grateful if you'd do it and give me a break. My hands are really sore. Look. Those are nasty blisters. Here we go. Let's go! This is "kaeru-uchi." This is the Gion "nagare-uchi." And now, "Isami-goma." Who's playing the "Isami-goma"? I don't know, but I think someone from the audience. I heard that there was no one left in Kokura who could do it. Is this the one you were always going on about? That's the true Gion festival drumming. Listen carefully. Now let's get wild! Every gift he's received from you was stored away, the seals unbroken... in his chest, as if they were his greatest treasures. SAVINGS Please look at this. With his low earnings, how could he have done this? He's put more than 500 yen in an account in your son's name. That's the kind of man he was. He had no desire for money at all. He was a rare thing. A generous man. A really good man. THE LIFE OF MUHOMATSU THE END
