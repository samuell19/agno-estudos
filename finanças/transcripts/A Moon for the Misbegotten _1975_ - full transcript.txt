Five past eleven, and he said he'd be here around nine. To hell with you, Jim Tyrone! What's bringing him home an hour before the Inn closes? He must be more paralyzed than ever I've known him. Ah, here you come, do you, as full as a tick! I'll give you a welcome, if you start cutting up! I'm in no mood to put up with you! Hurroo! Down with all tyrants, male and female! To hell with England, and God damn Standard Oil! Shut up your noise, you crazy old billy goat! A sweet daughter and a sweet welcome home in the dead of night.! I've had all I can bear this night, and I want some peace and sleep, and not to listen to an old lush! That's right. Fight with me. My own daughter has no feelings or sympathy. As if I hadn't enough after what's happened tonight.- What's happened? He's agreed to sell the farm, that's what! Simpson came to the Inn to see him with a new offer from Harder. Ten thousand, cash. Ten thousand! Sure, three is all it's worth at most. And two was what you offered that Jim promised- What's money to Harder? After what we did to him, all he wants is revenge. And here's where he's foxy. Jim won't have to wait for his half of the cash till the estate's settled. Harder offers to give him five thousand cash as a loan against the estate the second the sale is made. Jim can take the next train to New York. And Jim accepted? I don't believe you! Don't then. You'll believe it tomorrow! Harder proposed that he meet with Jim and the executors in the morning and settle it, and Jim promised Simpson he would Maybe he'll get so drunk he won'tremember He won't. Harder's coming in his automobile to pick him up and make sure of him. I don't think because he forgot you were waiting...in the moonlight, eating your heart out, that he'd ever miss a date with five thousand dollars, and all the pretty whores of Broadway he can buy with it. Will you shut up! And where were you when all this happened? Couldn't you do anything to stop it? I couldn't. Simpson came and sat at the table with us... And you let him?! Jim invited him. Anyway, I wanted to find out what trick he had up his sleeve, and what Jim would do. When it was all over, I got up and took a swipe at Simpson, but I missed him. I was too drunk...too drunk...too drunk...I missed him, God forgive me! If you don't keep awake, be God, I won't miss you! I was going to take a swipe at Jim, too, but I couldn't do it. I'd come to love him like a son- - a real son of my heart! to take the place of that jackass, Mike, and me two other jackasses. I think now Mike was the only one in this house with any sense! So I only called him a dirty lying skunk of a treacherous bastard, and I turned my back on him and left the Inn, and I made myself sing on the road so he'd hear, and they'd all hear in the Inn, to show them I didn't care a damn. Sure, wasn't you the hero! A hell of a lot of good... Ah, well, I suppose the temptation was too great. He's weak, with one foot in the grave from whiskey. Maybe we shouldn't blame him! Not blame him? Well, I blame him, God damn him! Are you making excuses for him, you old fool! I'm not. He's a dirty snake! But I was thinking how do I know what I wouldn't do for five thousand cash, and how do you know what you wouldn't do? Nothing could make me betray him! Or it couldn't before. There's nothing I wouldn't do now. Do you think I'm lying? Just give me a chance- I remembered something. You know, Josie, for all his Broadway wisdom about women, you've made a prize damned fool of him and that's some satisfaction! How'd you mean? You'll never believe it. Neither did I, but he kept on until, be God, I saw he really meant it. Meant what? It was after he'd turned queer...early in the night before Simpson came. He started talking about you, as if you was on his mind, worrying him... and before he finished I take my oath I began to hope you could really work Mike's first scheme on him, because all his gab was about his great admiration for you.! He said you had great beauty in you that no one appreciated but him.! Great strength you had, and great pride, he said...and great goodness,! But here's where you've made a prize jackass of him, like I said. Listen now, darlin', and don't drop dead with amazement. He believes you're a virgin! He does, so help me! the poor dunce! He thinks you're a poor innocent virgin! He thinks it's all boasting and pretending you've done about being a slut. A virgin, no less! You! Stop saying it! Boasting and pretending, am I? The dirty liar! You don't have to tell me. Are you taking it as an insult? Why the hell don't you laugh? Be God, you ought to see what a stupid sheep that makes him. I know why he didn't keep his date with you. It wasn't that he'd forgot. He remembered well enough, for he talked about it... You mean he deliberately, knowing I'd be waiting- God damn him! His conscience was tormenting him. He's going to leave you alone and not see you again... for your sake, because he loves you! Loves me? You're making it up. I'm not. I know it sounds crazy but... What did he mean, for my sake? Can't you see it? You're a pure virgin to him, but there's more besides your beautiful soul he feels drawn to, stop it, Father! You know I'm only a big... So he'll keep away from temptation because he can't trust himself, and it'd be a sin on his conscience if he was to seduce you. Oh, be God! So that was his reason... So he thinks all he has to do is crook a finger and I'll fall for him, does he, the vain Broadway crook! - and sitting at the bar,... having a drink together! It must have been mad, surely. I wish I'd been there to laugh up my sleeve. But what's all his crazy lying blather got to do with him betraying us and selling the farm? Nothing. I only thought you'd like to know you'd had that much revenge. A hell of a revenge! I'll have a better one than that on him...or I'll try to! I'm not like you, owning up I'm beaten and crying wurra-wurra like a coward and getting hopeless drunk! Get your wits about you and answer me this: Did Simpson get him to sign a paper? No, but what good is that? In the morning he'll sign all they shove in front of him. It's this good. It means we still have a chance. Or I have. What chance? Are you going to beg him to take pity on us? I'll see him in hell first! There's another chance, and a good one. But I'll need your help- And look at you, your brains drowned in whiskey, so I can't depend on you! You can, if there's any chance. I'll make myself as sober as a judge for you in the wink of an eye! But what can you do now, darlin'? You haven't even got him here. He's down at the Inn sitting alone, drinking and dreaming of the little whores he'll be with tomorrow night on Broadway. I'll get him here! I'll humble my pride and go down to the Inn for him! And if he doesn't want to come I've a way to make him. I'll disgrace him till he'll be glad to come with me to shut me up. If I was a dainty, pretty tart he'd be proud I'd raise a rumpus about him. But when it's a big, ugly hulk like me! If he ever was tempted to want me, he'd be ashamed of it. That's the truth behind the lies he told you of his conscience and his fear he might ruin me, God damn him! No, he meant it, Josie. But never mind that now. Let's say you've got him here. Then what will you do?! I told you this morning if he ever broke his promise to us I'd do anything and not mind how crooked it was. And I will! Your part in it is to come at sunrise with witnesses and catch us in... In bed, is it? Then it's Mike's second scheme you're thinking about? I told you I didn't care how dirty a trick... The dirtier the better now But how'll you get him in bed, with all his honorable scruples, thinking you're a virgin? But I'm forgetting he stayed away because he was afraid he'd be tempted. So maybe-! For the love of God, don't harp on his lies. He won't be tempted at all. But I'll get him so drunk he'll fall asleep and I'll carry him in and put him in bed... That's the way! But you'll have to get a pile of whiskey down him. You'll never do it unless you're more sociable The best way would be for you to drink with him. It would put him at his ease and unsuspecting, and it'd give you courage, too, so you'd act bold for a change instead of giving him brazen talk he's tired of hearing, while you act shy as a mouse. You're full of sly advice all of a sudden, ain't you? You dirty little tick! Didn't you tell me to get hold of my wits? Be God, if you want me drunk, I've only to let go. That'd suit me. I want to forget my sorrow, and I've no faith in your schemes because you'll be too full of scruples. Like the drinking. You're such a virtuous teetotaller... All I meant was, it's not right, a father to tell his daughter how to- I don't need your advice. Haven't I had every man I want around here? Ah, thank God, that sounds natural! I was beginning to think you were playing the virgin for me just because that Broadway sucker thinks you're one. Shut up! I'm not playing anything. And don't worry I can't do my part of the trick. That's the talk! But let me get it all clear. I come at sunrise with my witnesses, and you've forgot to lock your door, and we walk in, and there's the two of you in bed, and I raise the roof and threaten him if he don't marry you... Marry him? I wouldn't marry him now if he was the last man on earth! All we want is a paper signed by him with witnesses that he'll sell the farm to you for the price you offered, and not to Harder. Well, that's justice, but that's all it is. I thought you wanted to make him pay for his black treachery against us, the dirty bastard! I do want! It's the estate money you're thinking of, isn't it? Well, so am I! If I'm to play whore, I deserve my pay! I'll make him sign a paper he owes me ten thousand dollars the minute the estate is settled. I'll bet none of his tarts on Broadway ever got a thousandth part of that out of him, no matter how dainty and pretty they are! And here's what'll be the greatest joke to teach him a lesson. He'll pay it for nothing! I'll get him in bed but I'll never let him touch me! Och, Josie, that's the best yet! Oh, that'll teach him to double-cross his friends! That'll show him two can play at tricks! And him believing you so innocent! By God, you'll make him the prize sucker of the world! Won't I roar inside me when I see his face in the morning! Stop it! You're letting yourself be drunk again. We've done enough talking. Let's start- Wait. There's another thing. Just what do you want me to threaten him with when I catch you? That we'll sue him for outraging your virtue? Sure, his lawyer would have all your old flames in the witness box, So what threat... I can't think of any he wouldn't laugh at. Well, I can! Do I have to tell you his weakness again? It's his vanity about women, and his Broadway pride he's so wise no woman could fool him. It's the disgrace to his vanity...being caught with the likes of me... My mug beside his in all the newspapers... the New York papers, too... he'll see the whole of Broadway splitting their sides laughing at him... and he'll give anything to keep us quiet, I tell you. He will! I know him! So don't worry By God, you're right! You're steady on your pins, ain't you, you scheming old thief, now there's the smell of money around! Stay outside until you see me come out with him. Then you can sneak in the Inn yourself and pick the witnesses to stay up with you. But mind you don't get drunk again, and let them get too drunk. I won't, I take my oath! Be God, you've got the proud, fighting spirit in you that never says die, and you make me ashamed of my weakness. You're that eager now, be damned if I don't almost think you're glad of the excuse! Excuse for what? To show him no man can get the best of you... what else?... like you showed all the others. I'll show him to his sorrow! Come on. Wait. I'd better give a look at myself in the mirror. Sure, those in my trade have to look their best! A look in the mirror and she's forgot to light her lamp! God forgive me, it's bitter medicine. But it's the only way I can see that there's a chance now. There, now. Don't I look ten thousand dollars' worth to any drunk? You look a million, darlin'! Come along, then. Look! There's someone on the road... Be God, it's him! So he didn't forget! Well, it proves he can't keep away from you, and that'll make it easier for you... Oh, the dirty, double-crossing bastard! The nerve of him! Coming to call on you, after making you wait for hours, thinking you don't know what he's done to us this night, and it'll be a fine cruel joke to blarney you in the moonlight, and you trusting him like a poor sheep, and never suspecting... Shut up! I'll teach him who's the joker! I'll let him go on as if you hadn't told me anything... Yes, don't let him suspect it, or you wouldn't fool him. He'd know you were after revenge. I can't sneak away or he'd be suspicious. We've got to think of a new scheme to get away... I know how. Pretend we're fighting and I'm driving you off till you're sober. Put me out of my own home, will you, you undutiful slut! Celebration or not, I'll have no drunks cursing and singing all night. Go back to the Inn. I will! I'll get a room and two bottles and stay drunk as long as I please! Don't come back till you've slept it off, or I'll wipe the floor with you! Just in time for the Big Bout. Or is this the final round? Who the hell... Oh, it's you, is it? What was the big idea, Phil, leaving me flat? Leave you flat? Be Jaysus, that reminds me I owe you a swipe on the jaw for something. What was it? Be God, I'm too drunk to remember. But here it is, anyway. Stop it, you damned old fool, and get out of here! Taking his side against your poor old father? A hell of a daughter! Don't expect me home tonight, Miss Hogan, or tomorrow either, maybe. You can take your bad temper out on your sweetheart here. Bad luck to you both. Well, thank God. That's good riddance. Christ! I've never seen him that stinko before. He didn't seem so lit up at the Inn, but I guess I wasn't paying much attention. I should think, if you were a real gentleman, you'd be apologizing to me, not thinking of him. Don't you know you're two hours and a half late? I oughtn't to speak to you, if I had any pride. You've got too damn much pride, Josie. That's the trouble. What do you mean by that? Nothing, Josie.Just forget about it. I am sorry, Josie. I do apologize. Haven't any excuse. Can't think up a lie. Or, now I think of it, I had a damned good honorable excuse. Nuts. Forget it. Holy Joseph, you're full of riddles tonight. Well, I don't need excuses. I forgive you, anyway, now you're here. Come on now and we'll sit on my bedroom steps and be romantic in the moonlight, like we planned to. Had to get out of the damned Inn. I was going batty alone there. The old heebie-jeebies. So I came to you. I've really begun to love you a lot, Josie. Yes, you really proved that tonight, haven't you? Jim, wait! I'll forgive you for being so late. So go on about love. I'm all ears. I thought you'd have given me up and gone to bed. I remember I had some nutty idea I'd get in bed with you... just to lie with my head on your breast. Well, maybe I'll let you... Later, I mean. The night's young yet, and we'll have it all to ourselves. But here's for a starter. There, now. Thanks, Josie. Hark, Hark, the Donegal lark! "Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird." Can't Phil sing anything but that damned dirge, Josie? Still, it seems to belong tonight- in this moonlight...or in my mind... "Now more than ever seems it rich to die, To cease upon the midnight with no pain, In such an ecstasy!" Good God! Ode to Phil the Irish Nightingale! I must have the D.T.'s. Maybe it's only your bad conscience. What put that in your head? Conscience about what? How would I know, if you don't? For the sin of wanting to be in bed with me. Maybe that's it. Oh. Forget that stuff, Josie. I was half nutty. Och, for the love of God, don't apologize as if you was ashamed of... All right. I certainly won't apologize...if you're not kicking. I was afraid I might have shocked your modesty. My modesty? Be God, I didn't know I had any left. Nix, Josie. Lay off that line, for tonight at least. I'd like tonight to be different. Different from what? All right. I'll be as different as you please. Thanks, Josie. Just be yourself. This being out in the moonlight instead of the lousy Inn isn't a bad bet, at that. I don't know why I hang out in that dump, except I'm even more bored in the so-calledgood hotels in this hick town. Well, you'll be back on Broadway soon now, won't you? I hope so. Then you'll have all the pretty little tarts to comfort you when you get your sorrowful spell on. Oh, to hell with the rough stuff, Josie! You promised you'd can it tonight. You're a fine one to talk of promises! What's the matter? Still sore at me for being late? I'm not. I was teasing you. To prove there's no hard feelings, how would youlike a drink? But I needn't ask. I'll get a bottle of his best. Fine. Maybe that will have some kick. The booze at the Inn didn't work tonight. Well, this'll work. God damn it! You'll be crying in your beer in a minute. "And baby's cries can't waken her In the baggage coach ahead." Drunken son of a bitch! Thank God! Ah! At last the old booze! You'd think I'd been gone years. You didn't seem so perishing for a drink. It's you I was perishing for. I've been dying of loneliness... You'll die of lying some day. But I'm glad you're alive again.. I thought when I left you really were dying on me. No such luck. Och, don't talk like that. Come have a drink. We'll use the boulder for a table and I'll be barkeep. What's come over you, Jim? You look as if you've seen a ghost. I have. My own. He's punk company. Yes, it's the worst ghost of all, your own. Don't I know? But this will keep it in its place. Here. But wait till I join you. Hello! I thought you never touched it. I have on occasion. And this is one. I don't want to be left out altogether from celebrating our victory over Harder. Don't look at me as if I was up to some game. A drink or two will make me better company, and help me enjoy the moon and the night together. Here's luck. All right. Here's luck. Some of it went down the wrong way. So I see. That'll teach you to pour out baths instead of drinks. It's the first time I ever heard you complain a drink was too big. Yours was too big. I'm my father's daughter. I've a strong head. So don't worry I'll pass out and you'll have to put me to bed. Sure, that's a beautiful notion. I'll have to pretend I'm a drunk... Nix on the raw stuff, Josie. Remember you said- I'd be different? That's right. I'm forgetting it's your pleasure to have me pretend I'm an innocent virgin tonight. If you don't look out, I'll call you on that bluff, Josie. I'd like to. You know that, don't you? I don't at all. You're the one who's bluffing. Josie!Nix. Let's cut it out. How about another drink? That's honest-to-God old bonded Bourbon. How the devil did Phil get hold of it? Tom Lombardo, the bootlegger, gave him a case for letting him hide a truckload in our barn when the agents were after him. He stole it from a warehouse on faked permits. Have another! Let's sit down where the moon will be in our eyes and we'll see romance. Here's hoping before the night's out you'll have more courage and kiss me at least. That's a promise. Here's how. Now don't sink back half-dead-and-alive in dreams the way you were before. I wasn't. I had a good final dose of heebie-jeebies when you were in the house. That's all for tonight. Let the dead past bury the dead. That's the talk. There's only tonight, and the moon, and us... and the bonded Bourbon. Have another drink, and don't wait for me. Not now, thanks. They're coming too fast. Trying to get me soused, Josie? I'm not. Only to get you feeling happy, so you'll forget all your sadness. I might forget all my honorable intentions, too. So look out. I'll look forward to it... and I hope that's another promise, like the kiss you owe me. If you're suspicious I'm trying to get you soused...well, here goes. There, now. I must be scheming to get myself soused, too. Maybe you are. If I was, it'd be to make you feel at home. Don't all the pretty little Broadway tarts get soused with you? There you go again with that same old line! All right, I won't! I must be eaten up with jealousy for them, that's it. You needn't be. They don't belong. And I do? Yes. You do. For tonight only, you mean? We've agreed there is only tonight... and it's to be different from any past night...for both of us. I hope it will be. I'll try to control my envy for your Broadway flames. I have a picture of them in my mind as small and dainty and pretty... They're just gold-digging tramps. While I'm only a big, rough, ugly cow of a woman. Shut up! You're beautiful. God pity the blind! You're beautiful to me. It must be the Bourbon... You're real and healthy and clean and fine and warm and.. I have a beautiful soul, you mean? Well, I don't know much about ladies' souls... But I do know you're beautiful. And I love you a lot...in my fashion. Jim... Sure, you're full of fine compliments all of asudden, and I ought to show you how pleased I am. That's for my beautiful soul. You have a beautiful strong body, too, and beautiful eyes and hair, and a beautiful smile and beautiful warm breasts. Nix! Nix! Don't be a fool, Josie. Don't let me pull that stuff. You meant it! I know you meant it! Be God, you're right I'm a damned fool to let you make me forget you're the greatest liar in the world! I mean, the greatest kidder. And now, how about another drink? You don't get me, Josie. You don't know...and I hope you never will know... Maybe I know more than you think! There's always the aftermath that poisons you. I don't want you to be poisoned... Maybe you know what you're talking about... And I don't want to be poisoned myself...not again...not with you! There have been too many nights...and dawns. This must be different. I just want... Don't get in one of your queer spells, now. I don't think you know what you want. Except another drink. I'm sure you want that. And I want one, too. Fine! Grand idea. You're not polite, pouring your own first. I said a drink was a grand idea...for me. Not for you. You skip this one. Oh, I do, do I? Are you giving me orders? Yes. Take a big drink of moonlight instead. You'll pour me a drink, if you please, Jim Tyrone, or... All right, if you want to take it that way, Josie. It's your funeral. Thank you kindly. Here's to tonight. I've slept with drunken tramps on too many nights! All right, Jim, if you don't want me to... I'm sorry, Josie. Don't know what the drink got into me. Here. I'll pour you another. No, thank you. I'll skip this one. But you drink up. Thanks. That fat blonde pig on the train...I got her drunk! That's why- What are you talking about? What train? No train. Don't mind me. Maybe I'll tell you...later, when I'm... That'll cure you...for all time! I guess I'm more stewed in the center of the old bean than I thought... I better beat it back to the Inn and go to bed and stop bothering you, Josie. Well, you won't, not if I have to hold you. Come on now, bring your drink and sit down like you were before. Everything is far away and doesn't matter... except the moon and its dreams, and I'm part of the dreams... and you are, too. I keep forgetting the thing I've got to remember. I keep hoping it's a lie, even though I know I'm a damned fool. Damned fool about what? Never mind. I've just had a thought. If my poor old father had seen you knocking his prize whiskey on the ground... Holy Joseph, he'd have had three paralytic strokes! Yes, I can picture him. But that's all a fake. He loves to play tightwad, but the people he likes know better. He's a grand old scout, Josie. He'd give them the shirt on his back. The best friend I've got left... except you. I love his guts. Och, for the love of God...! Yes, I suppose that does sound like moaning-at-the-bar stuff. But it's true. Do you? Well, I know my father's virtues without you telling me. You ought to appreciate him because he worships the ground you walk on... and he knows you a lot better than you think. As do I...almost. That's not saying much. Maybe I can guess what you think you know... If it's that, God pity you, you're a terrible fool. If it's what? I haven't said anything. You'd better not, or I'll die laughing at you. Why don't you drink up? Real bonded Bourbon. Still trying to get me soused, Josie? I'm not such a fool...with your capacity. You better look out. It might work- and then think of how disgusted you'd feel, with me lying beside you, probably snoring, as you watched the dawn come. You don't know... The hell I don't! Isn't that the way I've felt with every one of them, after? But take it from me, I know. I've seen too God-damned many dawns creeping grayly over too many dirty windows. But it might be different with you. Love could make it different. And I've been head over heels in love ever since you said you loved my beautiful soul. Don't stand there like a loon, mourning over the past. Sure thing. Real bonded Bourbon. I ought to know. If I had a dollar for every drink of it I had before Prohibition, I'd hire your neighbour, Harder, for a valet. You'd better remember I said you had beautiful eyes and hair...and breasts. I remember you did. So sit down and I'll let you lay your head... No. If you won't watch your step, I've got to. And don't let me get away with pretending I'm so soused I don't know what I'm doing. I always know. Or part of me does. That's the trouble. You better look out, Josie. She was tickled to death to get me pie-eyed. Had an idea she could roll me, I guess. She wasn't so tickled about it...later on. What she? I hope you don't think I'm scheming to roll you. What? Of course not. What are you talking about? For God's sake, you're not a tart. No, I'm a fool. I'm always giving it away. That lousy bluff again, eh? You're a liar! For Christ sake, quit the smut stuff, can't you! Listen to me, Jim! Drunk or not, don't you talk that way to me or... How about your not talking the old smut stuff to me? You promised you'd be yourself. You don't get it, Josie. You see, she was one of the smuttiest talking pigs I've ever listened to. What she? Do you mean the blonde on the train? Train? Who told you...? Oh...that's right...I told you that... What blonde? What's the difference? It was long time ago. Coming back from the Coast. There is no present or future... only the past happening over and over again... now. I just can't get away from it. Nuts! To hell with that crap. You came back from the Coast about a year ago after- Yes. After Mama's death. But I've been to the Coast a lot of times during my career as a third-rate ham. I don't remember which time...or anything much...except I was pie-eyed in a drawing room the whole four days. What were we talking about before? What a grand guy Phil is. You ought to be glad you've got him for a father. Mine was an old bastard. He wasn't! He was one of the finest, kindest gentlemen who ever lived. Outside the family, sure. Inside, he was a lousy tightwad bastard. You ought to be ashamed! Of what? To speak ill of the dead? Nuts! He can't hear, and he knows I hated him, anyway...as much as he hated me. I'm glad he's dead. So is he. Or he ought to be. Everyone ought to be, if they have any sense. Out of a bum racket. At peace. Nuts! What of it?- Jim, don't. I hate you when you talk like that. Do you want to spoil our beautiful moonlight night? And don't be telling me of your old flames, on trains or not. I'm too jealous. Of that pig? You're a fool to be jealous of anyone. You're the only woman I care a damn about. All right, I'll try and believe that...for tonight. Why did you say a while ago I'd be leaving for New York soon? Well, I was right, wasn't I? Why are you pulling your hand away? Was I? I suppose because it seems crazy for you to hold my big ugly paw so tenderly. But you're welcome to it, if you like. I do like. It's strong and kind and warm... like you. Och, for the love of God...! Wasting kisses on my hand! Sure, even the moon is laughing at us. Nuts for the moon! I'd rather have one light on Broadway than all the moons since Rameses was a pup. You'll be taking a train back to your dear old Broadway tomorrow night, won't you? Tomorrow night? Where did you get that? A little bird told me. You'd better give that bird the bird. By the end of the week, is the right dope. Phil obviously got his dates mixed. He didn't tell me. He was too drunk to remember anything. He was sober when I told him. I called up the executors when we reached the Inn after leaving here. They said the estate would be out of probate within a few days. I told Phil the glad tidings and bought drinks for all and sundry. There was quite a celebration, Josie.. Funny, Phil wouldn't remember that. It is...funny. Well, he's stewed to the ears. That always explains anything. Only sometimes it doesn't. No...sometimes it doesn't. Phil certainly has a prize bun on tonight. He never took a punch at me before. And that drivel he talked about owing me something... What got into his head, I wonder. How should I know, if you don't? Well, I don't. Not unless... I remember I did try to get his goat. Simpson sat down with us. Harder sent him to see me. You remember after Harder left here I said the joke was on you, that you'd made this place a gold mine. I was kidding, but I wasn't too far from the truth. What do you think he told Simpson to offer me? Ten thousands dollars! On the level, Josie. And you accepted? I told Simpson to tell Harder I did. I decided the best way to fix him was to let him think he'd got away with it, and then when he comes tomorrow morning to drive me to the executor's office, I'll tell him what he can do with himself, his bankroll, and tin oil tanks. So that's...the truth of it. Of course, I did it to kid Phil, too. He was right there, listening. But I know I didn't fool him. Maybe you did fool him, for once. But I don't know. And that's why he took a swing at me? Well, if so, it's one hell of a joke on him. All the same, I'll be good and sore, Josie. I promised this place wouldn't be sold except to him. He ought to know I wouldn't double-cross you and him for ten million! Jim, I know that! I knew it- Oh, Jim, I love you. Thanks, Josie. I mean, for not believing I'm a rotten louse. Everyone else believes it... including myself... for a good reason, too. I'm a fool to let this stuff about Phil get under my skin, but... Why, I remember telling him tonight I'd even written my brother and got his okay on selling the farm to him. And Phil thanked me. He seemed touched and grateful. You wouldn't think he'd forget that. I wouldn't, indeed. There's a lot of things he'll have to explain when he comes at sun... When he comes back. The damned old schemer, I'll teach him to... to act like a fool. What a bluff you are, Josie. You'll get out the old club? You and your lovers, Messalina...when you've never... Shut up, Jim! "Pride is the sin by which the angels fell." Are you going to keep that up...with me? You think I've never because no one would...because I'm a great ugly cow... Nuts! You could have had any one of them. You kidded them till you were sure they wanted you. That was all you wanted. And then you slapped them groggy when they tried for more. But you had to keep convincing yourself... Don't, Jim. You can take the truth, from me. Because you and I belong to the same club. We can kid the world but we can't fool ourselves, no matter what we do... or escape ourselves no matter where we run away. Whether it's the bottom of a bottle, or a South Sea Island, we'd find our own ghosts there waiting to greet us... "sleepless with pale commemorative eyes," as Rossetti wrote. The old poetic bull, eh? Crap! You don't ask how I saw through your bluff, Josie. You pretend too much. And so do the guys. I've listened to them at the Inn. They all lie to each other. No one wants to admit all he got was a slap in the puss, when he thinks a lot of other guys made it. And they know you don't care how they lie. So they go on and on... For the love of God, Jim! Don't! Phil is wise to you, of course, but although he knew that I knew, he would never admit it until tonight. So he admitted it, did he? Wait till I get hold of him! He'll never admit it to you. He's afraid of hurting you. He is, is he? Well- For the love of God, can't you shut up about him! Oh, all right. I wanted to set things straight, ok?... For Phil's sake as well as for yours. You have a hell of a license to be angry, you know that? He's the one who ought to be. Don't you realize what a lousy position you've put him in with your brazen-trollop act? No. He doesn't care, except to use me in his scheming. He- Don't be a damned fool. Of course he cares. And so do I. I care, Josie. I love you. Do you, Jim? Do you? Then... I'll confess the truth to you. I've been a crazy fool. I am a virgin. And now you'll never...and I want you to...now more than ever...because I love you more than ever, after what's happened tonight ... But you will! I'll make you! To hell with your honorable scruples! I never believe you really wanted me! Tonight I know. It's in your kiss! As if I gave a damn what happened after! I'll have had tonight and your love to remember for the rest of my life! Jim, haven't you said yourself there's only tonight? Come with me. Sure thing, Kiddo. What the hell else do you suppose I came for? I've wanted you all along. I know what you want, Bright Eyes. Love, nuts! I'll show you what love is. Come on, Baby Doll, let's hit the hay. Jim! Don't! Jim! I'm not a whore. Did I try to rape you, Josie? I'm sorry. I'm drunk...not responsible. Don't cry. You stopped me, right? No harm done. You stopped me! I knew what I was doing. I was seeing things. That's the truth, Josie. I thought you were the blonde on the train... The old heebie-jeebies is coming back. Hair of the dog. I'll have another shot... Pour the whole bottle down your throat, if you like! Only stop talking! Can't forgive me, eh? You ought to. You ought to thank me for letting you see- Well, here's how. That was a nightcap. Our moonlight romance seems to be a flop, Josie. I guess I'd better go. Yes. You'd better go. Good night. Not good night. Good-bye. Good-bye? Yes. I won't see you again before I leave to New York. I was a damned fool to come tonight. I hoped...But you don't get it. How could you? Jim.. Whore? Who said you were a whore? Why did you have to act like one, asking me to come to bed? That wasn't what I came here for. - you promised tonight would be different. Why the hell did you promise that, if all you wanted was what all the others want, if that's all love means to you? Oh, Christ, I'm sorry, Josie. I know how you feel, and if I could give you happiness I would, Josie... But it won't work. You don't know me. I'd poison it for myself and for you. I've poisoned it already, haven't I, but it would be a million times worse after... No matter how I tried not to, I'd make it like all the other nights...for you, too. You'd lie awake and watch the dawn come with disgust, with nausea retching your memory, You'd hate yourself and you'd hate me. not for a day or two but for the rest of your life. Believe me, Kid, when I poison them, they stay poisoned! Good-bye, Jim. Good-bye. I'll find it hard to forgive, too. I came here tonight looking for love... just for this one night, because I thought you loved me. Nuts. To hell with it. Jim, stop this! There's nothing to hate you for. There's nothing to forgive. Sure, I was only trying to give you happiness, because I love you. I'm sorry I was so stupid and didn't see... But I see now, and you'll find I have all the love you need. Thanks, Josie. You're beautiful. I love you. I knew you'd understand. Of course I do. I didn't want to leave you. You know that. Indeed I know it. Come now. We'll sit down. That's it...with my arm around you. Forgive my selfishness, thinking only of myself. if there's one thing I owe you tonight, after all my lying and scheming, it'll be my pride and my joy It's easy enough, too for I have all kinds of love for you and maybe this is the greatest of all... because it costs so much. Jim! Don't look like that! Like what? It's the moonlight. It makes you look so pale, and with your eyes closed- You mean I looked dead? No! As if you'd fallen asleep. Listen, and I'll tell you a little story, Josie. When I was a kid, I loved race-horses. I thought they were the most beautiful things in the world. I liked to gamble, too. So the big dream was that someday I'd have enough dough to play a cagey system of betting on favorites, and follow the horses south in the winter, and come back north with them in the spring, and be at the track every day. I thought that would be the ideal life...for me. Well, you'll be able to do it. No. I won't be able to do it, Josie. That's the joke. I gave it a try-out before I came up here. I borrowed some money on my share of the estate, and started going to tracks. I played my system, but I found I didn't care if I won or if I lost. The horses were beautiful, but they didn't matter anymore I could't wait till the last race of the day so I could go back to the hotel room... and to the lousy God damned bottle who was waiting for me Why did you tell me this? You said I looked dead. Well, I am. You're not! Don't talk like that! Ever since Mama died. I've felt all along-it was that sorrow was making you... Maybe if you talked about your grief for her, it would help you You'd better look out, Josie.! Why? I might develop a crying jag, and sob on your beautiful breast. You can sob all you like Don't encourage me. But if you're such a glutton for punishment... After all, I said I'd tell you later, didn't I? You said you'd tell me about the blonde on the train. She's part of it. I lied about that. I can't tell you, you couldn't understand or forgive- But you might. You're the one person who might forgive. Because you really love me. And because you're the only woman I know who understands the lousy rotten things a man can do when he's crazy drunk, and draws a blank... especially when he's nutty with grief to start with. Of course I'll understand, Jim. But I didn't draw a blank. I tried to. I drank enough to knock out ten men. But it didn't work. I knew what I was doing. No, I can't tell you, Josie. You'd loathe my guts, and I couldn't blame you- No! I'll love you no matter what... Remember that's a promise! Maybe you'd better not...if it will make you suffer. Trying to welch now, eh? It's too late. You've got me started. Suffer? Christ, I ought to suffer! When Mama died, I'd been on the wagon for nearly two years. Not even a glass of beer. Honestly. And I would have stayed on. For her sake. She had no one but me. The Old Man was dead. My brother had married...had a kid... had his own life to live. She had only me to attend to things for her and take care of her. She'd always hated my drinking. So I quit. It made me happy to quit for her. Because she was all I had, all I cared about. Because I loved her No one would believe that now, who knew... But I did. I know how much you loved her. We went out to the Coast to see about selling a piece of property the Old Man had bought there a couple of years earlier And one day she suddenly became ill. Got rapidly worse. Went into a coma. Brain tumor. The docs said, no hope. Might never come out of coma. I went crazy. Couldn't stand the fact of losing her. The old booze yen got me. I got drunk and stayed drunk. And I began hoping she'd never come out of the coma, and see I was drinking again. That was my excuse, too...that she'd never know. And she never did. Nix! Kidding myself again. I know damned well just before she died she recognized me. She opened her eyes, she saw that I was drunk. and she was glad to die! You only imagine that because you feel guilty about drinking. After that, I kept so drunk I did draw a blank most of the time, and no one guessed how drunk I was because I went through the necessary motions But there are things I can never forget... the undertakers, and her body in a coffin with her face made up. I couldn't hardly recognize her. She looked young and pretty like someone I remembered meeting long ago. Almost a stranger. To whom I was a stranger. Cold and indifferent. Not worried about me any more. Free at last. Free from pain, from suffering. From me. I stood there a long time looking down at her, and something happened to me. I found I couldn't feel anything. I knew I ought to be heartbroken but I couldn't feel anything. I seemed dead, too. I knew I ought to cry. Even a crying jag would look better than just standing there. But I couldn't cry. I cursed to myself, "You stupid bastard, that is Mama. You loved her, and now she's dead. She's gone away from you forever. Never, never again..." All I did was try to explain to myself, "She's dead. What does she care now if I cry or not, or what I do? For God's sake, can't you leave her alone even now? For God's sake, can't you let her rest in peace? But there were several people around and I knew they expected me to show something. Once a ham, always a ham! So I put on an act. I flopped on my knees and hid my face in my hands and faked some sobs and cried, "Mamma! My dear mamma!". But all the time I kept saying to myself, "You lousy ham! You God-damned lousy ham! Christ, in a minute you'll start singing 'Mother Macree'! Jim! Don't! It's past. I had to bring her body East to be buried beside the Old Man. I took a drawing room and hid in it with a case of booze. She was in her coffin in the baggage car. No matter how drunk I got, I couldn't forget that for a minute. I found I couldn't stay alone in the drawing room. It became haunted. I was going crazy. I had to go out and wander up and down the train looking for company. I made such a public nuisance of myself that the conductor threatened if I didn't quit, he'd keep me locked in the drawing room. But I'd spotted one passenger who was used to drunks and she could pretend to like them, if there was enough dough in it. She had parlor house written all over her... who looked more like a whore than twenty-five whores, with a face like an overgrown doll's and a come-on smile as cold as a polar bear's feet. I bribed the porter to take a message to her and that night she sneaked into my drawing room. She was bound for New York, too. So every night...for fifty bucks a night... Oh, how could you! How could I? I don't know. I had some mad idea she could make me forget... what was in the baggage car ahead. It was like some plot I had to carry out. The blonde...she didn't matter. She was only something that belonged in that damned plot. It was as if I wanted revenge- - because I'd been left alone... because I knew I was lost, without any hope left... that all I could do would be drink myself to death, because no one was left who could help me. No, I didn't forget even in that pig's arms! I remembered the last two lines of a lousy tear-jerker song I'd heard when I was a kid "And baby's cries can't waken her In the baggage coach ahead." I couldn't stop it singing. I didn't want to stop it! Jim! For the love of God. I don't want to hear it anymore! Well, that's all... except I was too drunk to go to her funeral Oh! Don't want to touch me now, eh? I'm a damned fool. I shouldn't have told you. Jim. Don't say...I don't want to touch you. It's...a lie.- I wish I could believe in the spiritualists' bunk. If I could tell her it was because I missed her so much and couldn't forgive her for leaving me- She'd understand and forgive me, don't you think? She always did. She was simple and kind and pure of heart. She was beautiful. You're like her deep in your heart. That's why I told you. I thought... My mistake. Nuts! I don't like your damned moon, Josie. It's an ad for the past. "It is the very error of the moon: She comes more nearer earth than she was wont, And makes men mad. I'll grab the last trolley for town. There'll be a speak open, and some drunk laughing. I need a laugh. No! You won't go! I won't let you! I understand now, Jim, darling, and I'm proud you came to me as the one in the world you know loves you enough to understand and forgive... and I do forgive! As she forgives, do you hear me! As she loves and understands and forgives! Do what you came for, my darling. It isn't drunken laughter in a speakeasy you want to hear at all, but the sound of yourself crying your heart's repentance against her breast. She hears. I feel her in the moonlight, her soul wrapped in it like a silver mantle, and forgives me, too.
