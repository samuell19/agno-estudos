Peninsula Apartments, Eastern District Tai, a veteran sergeant, fell from a high floor onto the atrium and severely injured Ghost, come this way Tai! Tai! You must hang on! Sir, another bloodletting with electric drill Inspector Ling... is fainted on 7th floor! Ling, Chief Inspector of Serious Crime Unit found fainted on 7th floor corridor Ling Sir! Ling Sir! That murderer is downright mad He never stops until all blood is drained So why did he only spare Ling? Tai's body with bloody holes all over I still remember it clearly 15 minutes before Tai was attacked His phone shows a call from Ling Why did he only bring Tai to Peninsula Apartments? He could go with me! Or with you! Hey Leo, did Ling bring you along? - What are you getting at? - Say it! Can't I say what I think? Including Tai, 3 victims were blood-let already! Shouldn't we know what happened? Why only Tai went to Peninsula Apartments with Ling? If we were there too, Tai might not be injured Tai was alive and kicking when he went out and came back wounded like this While Ling has no wound at all! What do you want? Calm down! We're colleagues! Ling will explain when he wakes up and I'll make you kneel and apologize to him Shut up! George! Are you alright? Who do you think you are? Gangsters? What's the use of arguing when Ling Sir is still sleeping? Go now! Team B, everyone leave with me now Let Ling Sir take a good rest It'll be fine Don't worry You're awake? What happened really? Why am I here? Where's Sonny? - Sonny - Daddy Ghost Ling! What does the murderer look like? Tell me! And we'll dig him out! Murderer... What murderer? You and Tai met the murderer... at Peninsula Apartments Don't you remember? Peninsula Apartments? Why did I go to Peninsula Apartments? Why am I here? Where's Tai? Tai is still in Intensive Care Unit Tai has been blood-let with an electric drill and pushed down the atrium The doctor is trying to save him I hope he'll come around - Tai - Ling - Doctor - Tai How do you feel? Tai Why is he like that? His head impact may lead to temporary memory loss Temporarily, he may forget recent things This is normal. Don't worry. He will recover Doctor, when can I recover? Some recover in days, some take months. It depends Doctor, I need your diagnosis, not a wild guess! I am not guessing Before the report is ready, I cannot give a diagnosis Ling Sir, take a rest and try to relax Calm down and take a rest We will arrest the murderer Tai Tai Here you are Report says before Tai fell down the atrium he has been struggling There's fiber from his clothes and yours on his fingers Nothing else is found He looks like he has a lot to say Tell me what happened on the day of accident You, me and Tai, were working on this serial murder In 2 months, this bloodletting murderer has killed 2 innocent citizens already But we have no clue on his motive The murderer is extremely brutal He drills holes in the victims' bodies let their blood drain off and bleed to death Both our unit and Headquarter are very anxious Yesterday, you and Tai should both be off duty Your wife said you suddenly went out... at 2:30pm We checked the call logs in your phone and Tai's You called Tai at 2:18pm CCTV tape records of Peninsula Apartments... showed that Tai and you... went in at 3:00pm and 3: 15pm respectively Tai was 15 minutes earlier than you Then we received a call from the station Tai was found... injured on the atrium You have fainted on the 7th floor They suspect you hit your head and fainted We couldn't figure out why Why you and Tai went to Peninsula Apartments together Tai always tells us where he's going and you seldom go on operation alone My guess was, you suddenly came across some clues otherwise you won't meet the murderer by chance We searched the 7th floor, talked to all the occupants and checked all the CCTV tapes but no suspicious person has entered the building The murderer just disappeared as if he could fly Only you and Tai know... what happened that day Don't worry We will catch the murderer I must bring justice to Tai! Police Headquarters Ling Sir! Ling Sir! Chief! Sergeant! Have you got all the stuff? Take the stuff to the main office first I'll see if Intelligence Bureau has anything new OK Let's go! - Go. - Yes, Sir! Ling Sir! Chief... you've come back so early? Why don't you take more rest? I am fine. I don't need rest. Who are they? The Headquarter just sent them here Put all the stuff here first Yes Sir! Give me the file Meeting starts in 30 minutes Yu Sir! I know you won't stay in the hospital How are you? Feeling better now? I'm much better now I want to handle the case sooner Those reporters... They know you're injured and dug out everything about you overnight The rumors are filling the papers every day Now you're famous The Headquarter is very concerned about this case Too many issues involved The trickiest thing is this happens just before... your Superintendent promotion There is nothing you can do now but to wish that we'd close the case as soon as possible Then how about my promotion next month? It'll be on hold. We need to clear this case first I think you can understand In fact as a Chief Inspector, you've proven your ability already It's your health that's most important I heard that your memory... It'll just take some time There won't be a problem Ling George's team can help out this case... for the moment so you can take a good rest I don't need help, and I don't need rest I just want to follow this case It's up to you then You can also pass this case to Ghost You two buddies What's yours is his, and what's his is yours, right? Are you feeling better? Hiding from the world? How long has George's team been here? Since Tai's accident, Headquarter sent them here And today their whole team moves in Surely... they won't tell us what they find We all want to solve the case, that's all The first victim was found on September 20th Ken Cheung, aged 39 Dozens of holes found on his body They suspect an electric drill as the murder weapon He's a sports professor. No bad habits, no debts, a thoroughly decent man Less than 2 weeks later, on October 12th the second male victim was found Juno Ma, 40 years old His mouth slit open. The killer didn't treat him like human Used to be a comic artist, lives in Yaumatei area No wife, no money, no enemies Any connection between the 2 victims? On the surface, only connection is the way they died Both are blood-let using an electric drill We have no idea of the murderer's motive That's why the case has been so tough Both murders happened on Jagged Island It's near to where you live Watch out when you leave or go home You were in charge of this serial murder all the way Ling, you really can't remember a thing? I think I recall something Sonny! Don't make the computer so loud, understand? I understand! Morning daddy! Good boy Let's turn this down All right! You're awake? - Morning, Honey. - Have some breakfast When did I come back last night? Were you so tired that you forgot when you came back? You came home really late last night, wet through You slept all the way until now Come, Sonny, Daddy wants to join your game Look at you. So careless It's nothing Darling, why don't you drop this case? Why make it so hard on yourself? Can no one else solve the case? You needn't worry about me I'll solve the case very soon I just knew it You'd rather have me worry than give up the case Honey I've marked "Day off" on these 3 days What did I do on these 3 days? Usually you stay at home on day-offs Can you be more specific? I must know what I did on these 3 days These 3 days... I really can't recall anything You always stay with us on day-offs That day, you were at home all morning then you suddenly left in the afternoon Did I say where I went, or what I would do? No, you said nothing and left in a hurry Daddy's always gone suddenly Sonny, eat your food! Mommy, I want one more egg I'll go make one Sonny, now tell daddy What was I doing before I was in hospital? You were eating the cake I made What else? How did daddy go out? Sonny doesn't remember - You can remember. - Sonny doesn't remember You didn't lose your memory! You must remember! Sonny really can't remember! Come on, think! Sonny can't remember! - Mommy... - Sonny! When we adopted Sonny we said we'll love him like our own son Do you still remember? Yes, I said that I will not let our son get hurt again He makes such an effort to kill a person He must know that will give us more clues He is trying to get attention He must have his purpose Maybe this is his motive It's 9th floor! Not 7th floor! When Tai was lying here, I was standing on 9th floor I am sure it was 9th floor 9th floor? What are thinking so hard about? It's him! Who is he? I can't remember! I can't remember! The pump room stinks worse than a garbage room So many mice! Who'll collect your garbage? Smelly bastard! So many mice! Stinky mice! Goodness! What a stink! This monkey was also blood-let! It's the murderer Finally we have a clue The report says that on the crime scene there were no other cars or passer-bys - Ling Sir - Chief How is it? Any progress? We're waiting for Identification Bureau's report Don't worry, Chief. We'll handle it Ghost From now on put down what you're handling Just watch him carefully, understand? - Ok! - Yes, Sir! Those reporters, they know you're injured and searched your data Rumors are filling the papers Now you're famous When can I recover? They know you're injured and searched your data Some recover in days, some take months Then how about my promotion next month? It'll be on hold. We need to clear this case first Tai was found injured on the atrium Rumors are filling the papers And you were found fainted on the 7th floor There's fiber... from his clothes and yours on his fingers Some recover in days, some take months Take a good rest Your memory... Take good rest... George's team can help out this case... for the moment Speak! Ling Sir Coming back so early? So are you I know you're waiting for... the new report so I bring it to you We're doing the same case, so we try to help On the yellow electric drill found in the pump room they found Tai's blood It is certainly the murder weapon Unfortunately no fingerprints were found Thank you It's nothing Jagged Island Daddy Daddy, eat some cake - What's this flavor? - Chocolate What will you make next time? It depends! Who damaged your toy? You made those holes in my toy! Nonsense! It's true On the yellow electric drill found in the pump room they found Tai's blood I am innocent You also know that, don't you? You're the only one... who can prove my innocence I lost memory of so many things I tried to find evidence but what I found all point back at me I know someone's framing me Why? Why? The electric drill that drained your blood why is it the same as the one I have at home? Why is that? You are the only one who can testify what happened I can trust no one but you The murderer is after me He stalked me to my home He has stalked my son But I dare not move my home or I'll never know who's after me Honey! Sonny! Honey... Honey... Wash your hands, OK? Where have you been? You're home so early? I took Sonny to enjoy the sun Was it fun? Shall we go again tomorrow? No, you can't! From now on, don't run around Tell me where you'll go and I'll take you What happened really? Could you stop asking me why? Do it even if it's unreasonable. Just once I know you don't want me... to be afraid But I'm not afraid. Don't hide from me I am your wife What is it that you can't tell me? Minnie's coming back from US in 2 days Are you going to pick her up? OK I'm going out for a while You just came back. Where are you going? I need to change all the locks Doctor When can I regain my memory? I feel so dreadful I don't even know if I'm lying now I feel that I keep telling lies I've always been an honest person But nobody trusts me now My team, my wife. Why did I become like this? So sneaky I feel like dreaming every day I cannot concentrate at all I don't want to make mistake again Make mistake? It was 2 years ago I saw a criminal in the park I left my son in the park... to arrest him I did arrest the criminal but when I went back my son had fallen into the fishpond and was drowned I cannot forgive myself I cannot make mistake again I fear I'll lose my son again Time can heal the pain Shall I refer you to a psychologist? There's no need Then let's do another blood test and a brain scan, all right? I found something Holes on the victims' backs are not random I checked the other 2 corpses they look the same as Tai The holes were not made randomly It's a pattern - Chief! Ghost! - Chief! Ghost! Ling Sir Chief, be careful... you might throw up So sick! I never saw anything so awful Where did those nails come from? Goodness, that's so gruesome Ling Sir. Ghost Sir Ling Sir Where comes this stink? What a stench Ling Sir lives near Jagged Island too. Creepy This looks like the pump room should be the murderer's den Chief Investigation Bureau said the woman was... kept here many days before dying The murderer was away for many days? Impossible! He must have come back recently! How do you know? Have you been here? Nothing What I mean is it's impossible for a woman to last so long Have you recalled something? No, I recall nothing You're here Do you miss me? Tell me quickly, who do you love the most? Who do you love the most? Look at you, still like a kid in your 30s! Don't you feel embarrassed? I'm your little sister no matter how old I get I'm telling you, I won't go back to US I will follow you anywhere from now on Have you settled your things there? What's to settle? You just need a signature to divorce I come right back after signing Minnie I won't let you go back to US It's not safe around here don't go out so much Spend more time at home Why? Hey, I haven't finished! Just let him go He's been like this since the injury Brother is always responsible since he was small He gives his best to everything Dad was most fond of him He said Brother will have great success Brother is Dad's biggest pride Tell me more! When will you get well? I'll soon be fine I promise you Sonny What's the matter? Mommy... there's a monster! Good boy, Mommy's here. Don't be afraid I think I better sleep with him Good night The report shows that your brain scan is normal The previous impact on your brain... is recovered But there's a problem with your blood What? We found a drug... called "Propranolol" in your blood It cures high blood pressure, but it has side effects It causes dizziness and short-term memory loss That's why most doctors stopped using it But in recent years, some psychiatrists use it on patients... with severe mental anguish It's very strange that your blood shows high concentration of this drug It is like chronic poisoning Poisoning? You mean I cannot regain my memory because I've taken this drug continuously? It's this drug Tai You must hang on I know you can hear me You can hear what I say Wake up! I can't take this anymore I really don't know I don't know who's trying to harm me The murderer could be very close to me I fear that he would hurt my wife and son Why are you staring at me? What do you want to say? What do you want to say? Tai Get up! Get up now! Wake up! Get up quickly! Are you crazy? Nurse He's awake! Wake him up! Teammates I thought about the holes on the bodies and thought about the pattern That gave me an idea Look at the holes It's an animal shape when the holes are linked Looks like a rabbit or a mouse Like a child's drawing of an animal Study the pattern more carefully It does look like a rabbit to me From now on watch out for similar patterns Don't miss out anything I also want to solve this case soon I am as anxious as you are I don't care if you believe me I know the murderer is stalking me I feel he is here now watching us It's him! Don't run! I will catch you this time! I can prove to you! Don't run! Don't run! Don't run! Don't run! Freeze! I really saw the murderer Come have a drink at my place The last time I came to your place you just adopted Sonny and held a birthday party Tai was there too Wow, so many locks! You haven't been here in a while Thank you Have some Why so quiet? Don't you know each other? My sister Minnie, just returned from US Ghost - Hi! - Hi! Here, I return these photos to you Look, this cool kid here is my brother Guess which one is me? This one, obviously Pretty girls are always easy to spot Isn't your beauty standard a bit low? How long are you staying? I'm not leaving. Brother will take care of me The first victim was found on September 20th Less than 2 weeks later, Ken Cheung on October 12th, aged 39 the second male victim is found Juno Ma, 40 years old used to be a comic artist, lives in Yaumatei area No wife, no money, no enemies Sonny This is your Grandpa, this is Grandma Let me see There's one thing I haven't told him I'm having a baby Really? Then tell him quickly! I don't know if he'll be pleased Of course he will be pleased Don't cry, don't cry Mom told me, if the mother cried the baby would be ugly when it's born So don't cry, and be happy. Understand? It is true? Do you want a little brother or a sister? I want both! Sonny, tell Uncle Ghost Why did you draw this picture? What have you seen? Why did you draw this picture? Tell Uncle quickly! I didn't draw the picture! Can you give this picture to Uncle? No! You can draw another one if you like Hey, it's dessert time Come and try my nice work! Uncle, can you return the picture to me? What have you done? Stealing from a kid? Hey, bring it here if you've stolen it! Gee, and I wonder what it was Did you draw the rabbit, Sonny? Daddy drew it! It's late. I should go now. Thanks for dinner Come again soon, Ghost Sure. Goodbye Finish dessert before you go? Ghost Let's talk tomorrow Hey I was just kidding! It's just a dream. It's fine I don't even know if it's a dream These photos are from the victim, May Tong's home Ghost, are you alright? I'm fine Hello I know who the murderer is I saw him on the beach last night. I fought with him Why would I lie to you? I really saw the murderer! Tell the truth! Can you explain last night's drawing? Why is it the same pattern... as the victims' backs? You were on leave every time those murders happened You've been hiding all of these. Why? You just don't trust me! Right! I don't trust you now! Tell the truth and help me trust you! I really didn't draw that picture! I cannot regain my memory because someone was poisoning me How much longer are you going to lie? This photo was found in the female victim's home Why did you cover this up? You knew all the victims They were all your childhood neighbors All the evidences I found are against me If I told you earlier, would you believe me? What's the difference? Trust me, Ghost I really saw the murderer He's like a beggar, long hair and moves quickly Enough! Enough! I bring you here because I want to know if you have any truth to tell me! If you really don't trust me give me one week I will catch the murderer If you've given me time and I can't catch him then I have no one to blame No! You can't cover this any longer! Just one week! Don't hand in the photo now I will give you an answer in one week If you hand in the photo now, I'm finished! You give me this bullshit just to cover up! How long can you cover this up? If you are innocent, God will show you justice! If there's justice, Tai would not die! I just want to clarify this matter Listen to me. We have been friends for so long You know I will not hurt Tai I am innocent! Just because we've been friends for so long I give you a chance to tell the truth! You were having your promotion already! Why did you do all these? Ghost! Listen to me! Why don't you trust me? We are friends Give me that photo! - What are you doing? - Give me that! Don't you dare! Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me! You want me to die, right? You are jealous of me all the way, aren't you? No... You were checking on me! You want to finish me! - Haven't you? - No! I have been trying to help you! Bullshit! You pretend not to care, but you do mind You wanted the promotion most badly! Am I right? Am I right? Am I right? You're jealous. Even you are jealous of me! I'm not! Look at yourself! You are becoming a demon! You're jealous! You're jealous! Ghost Ghost... Ghost Ghost You're trying to kill me too? No - I'm not - I won't let you get away! I won't let you get away! No! I'm not! - I won't let you get away! - No! I'm not... No... No! No... I'm not! No! No! I'm not! No! No! What happened? Did your car break down? You're sweating so much! Why did you ask? Call a taxi next time if the car breaks down Don't walk home You said it's not safe around here Hello I was at home all day What happened? How did it happen? What's the matter? What happened? Ghost... He had an accident What happened to Ghost? Ghost... died All the 3 victims are my childhood neighbors The bloody holes... look like Baby's drawing Baby drew the picture 2 years before he died No one has seen it. How can the killer know? How am I to tell others? They think I'm unfit for duty and made me take a long leave But... no one will believe me now If it goes on like this, I'll never catch the murderer The case will never end Darling The day Ghost died, you were not at home Ghost is our friend. Why did you lie? Why did you lie? After I arrest the murderer I will bring you justice I will not owe you anything Freeze! Sonny! Sonny! Sonny! Let go of him! Daddy, don't leave me behind Sonny... Daddy will not leave you behind... Don't be afraid. Don't cry Daddy... Daddy don't leave me behind Brother! Why don't you let us go out? You locked all the doors and closed all the curtains! What's going on really? Do you know you look very scary now? Brother! Quiet! I'll explain when this is over Don't cry It's no use crying now You needn't worry at all. Just don't go out and I will protect you Minnie! You want beggar boy or your brother? Brother, he is my friend! My dad is not your dad! I'll teach you a lesson! I didn't lie! I didn't lie! Eat this mud! Your mom is miserable to have a son like you! I'll teach you a lesson so you'll never lie again! Do you admit that you lied? Sonny, tell daddy at the school that day besides the beggar, who else was there? It's me! The beggar boy! Can't recall? Your mom is miserable to have you! I'll teach you a lesson so you'll never lie again! Beggar Boy I am not afraid of you! I don't care if you are a ghost. Leave my son alone! Are there really so many ghosts? If so, they are in your heart I'm the Beggar Boy! I am human, not a ghost Who are you? Why do you look so alike? We're the same person, we surely look alike! Impossible! Ling, I haven't been myself for a long time I shouldn't call you daddy I should call you brother. My dear little brother I really didn't lie back then Impossible! How can you look the same as 30 years ago? Impossible! You are a ghost! Is it easier to accept that I'm a ghost? You'd rather accept a ghost... than a freak like me I never grow taller or older I always look the same, 10, 20 or 30 years old Until I was put into hospital I realized I have "Anti-aging sickness"! Anti-aging sickness? The body stops growing... after certain age but intelligence is normal. Get it? In Southeast Asia, 6 people have this sickness They are all kept in the State Hospital Originally, I was one of them But maybe God took pity on me He let me find my family again, to feel what "love" is Impossible Impossible! This is ridiculous! This is crazy! Crazy! I am over 40 years old now Your dad named me Ling Fook-Wing I remember every single face in your family 30 years ago, Mom brought me... from Southeast Asia to find Dad Have you forgotten your key? - Lily? - Feng! Let us in first! We came illegally! You should tell me you're coming! Father! You haven't grown taller? Dad married a rich woman in Hong Kong and had a son and a daughter We won't even know... if we hadn't come I don't know how to explain. I have my reasons Go now and we'll talk later, ok? - I'm not going! - Listen to me! I'll take you back first - My wife is coming home! - I'm not going I'm not going! Hurry up! Your dad threw us out We lived on the streets for a month Then we had to go back to Southeast Asia Our life got worse day by day People discover that I never grow up and they treated me like a freak We lived on the garbage we collect from one place to another Sometimes we could find food Sometimes we went hungry... until we found food But Mom did not let me starve I watched her become old I watched her suffer for a son... who never grows up and I could not protect her What you said was so right My mom is miserable to have a son like me! Mom, I promise you. I will not die! From the day mom died I had to make use of my body... to survive At first, a kind family adopted me but I knew they would soon... discover my body's secret I could only stay with them... for a short time I must plan for myself I sold their child to a baby trafficker The first time to harm someone felt terrible but you soon get used to it First you're sad; second time you're upset third time you'll be very vicious It just gets worse and worse Like using dirty water to clean a wall it gets dirtier and dirtier Gradually, my schemes became more sophisticated I understood the mechanism of evil-doings You should know what I'm saying You're not human. You're a ghost Whatever. Back then, I only thought of your mom I imagined how happy and noble she was Then I stopped thinking about your mom I thought, it's time for you to get married A man like you... must have married a beautiful wife I imagined sleeping with your wife all the time God knows, things you imagine... do become real Shut up! Say it! What do you want? I want you to know the feeling of being wronged But it's impossible You can't possibly do so many things! Who is the bloodletting murderer? You've seen him many times. That scavenger! His name is Mang Same as I, Mang was taken for research Fortunately we met in the hospital He suffers from "early-aging sickness" His body ages abnormally fast He is talented and moves very quickly With Mang, I decided to leave the hospital I tried every way to return to Hong Kong with Mang You chose me among so many kids Do I really look like your dead son? Well, we are brothers. We should look alike. You still can't recall the day at Peninsula Apartments? You really ate too much cake I fed you Daddy, finish this cake Is it good? You put poison in the cake You made me lose my memory I'll be disadvantaged if you're sober, right? I had a foster father... who's a psychiatry professor I used the drug on him. It's quite useful So I've kept it like treasure After we met again, of course I'll let you try it Without memory, you're like blank paper and I can do an experiment on you - Hello. - Hello, Uncle Tai I've lost daddy I have his phone but don't know how to go home... Don't be afraid Tell Uncle Tai where you are now I am in... Peninsula... Apartments Don't run around. Uncle Tai is coming to fetch you Your pistol is on 9th floor, Peninsula Apartments Delete message? Message deleted Tai is innocent! So is Ken Cheung Juno Ma May Tong They are all innocent! I don't want to hurt innocent people either I thought it over, and chose your old neighbors They are so famous, I found them from the internet And yet you don't remember them For Tai, he said openly at my birthday party that I've never grown taller over a year What a nosey man! To play safe, he must be sacrificed He only made one comment and you killed him? You're wrong. I never killed anyone really I just go to school, ride my bike, play my dolls Did I kill anyone? It's you who killed! You are the murderer! You've always seen yourself as a hero Always above others, a noble policeman I helped you find out the real you! You even killed a friend for your own interest This is the real you! Are you still a policeman? You should be a prisoner! You have been forcing me You forced me to do all this You had choices. You can choose not to kill him Isn't Ghost your good buddy? You had choices in every single step. Did I force you? Give me one week I don't believe you - You can't cover this any longer. - Just one week I will give you an answer No! No! If you want me to die you can just kill me Why did you do all these? Still don't understand? I don't want you to die I want you to go to the jail! To be a piece of shit! There are many feelings worse than death I've been through many, but you haven't I have blood on my hands already I might as well kill you too I will kill you, bastard, even if I'll go to jail! Brother... Bastard! Are you mad? Do you know what you're doing? He's your son, Brother! Why have you changed completely? Sober up! I'm not sober? Minnie Remember beggar boy... who played at our house? He is that beggar boy! He has anti-aging illness and is 40 years old! He comes to harm us! - What are you talking about? - Minnie! He is that beggar boy! He is that beggar boy! Beggar boy! I am Andy Chan from the Serious Crime Unit We need Mr. Ling to assist in an investigation On September 20, October 12 October 24 and November 10 where were you on these 4 days of incidents? I have nothing to say. Release me on bail. May Tong, Ken Cheung and Juno Ma what is your relationship with them? I have nothing to say. Release me on bail. I asked you many times. Don't fool around Answer me! - Don't hit! - You dare hit me? I'll beat you up! - I'll beat you up! - Chan Sir, don't! Don't you dare! Don't stand in my way! Hazel It's my fault I've been watching you... all this time My heart aches so much Maybe you won't believe, but I just want to say no matter what happens and how others see you I will always stand by you And there's one thing I haven't told you I'm having a baby Really? If I've listened to you and dropped the case things wouldn't become so bad Don't worry, I will bring you the best of luck Yes You are the best luck I ever had I'm sorry Hazel you have to promise me no matter what happens in future, leave Sonny alone and go back to US with Minnie You must believe me This boy is weird. He comes to harm us What are you talking about? Sonny is only a kid It's fine if you don't trust me but you have to promise me as soon as I'm out of here leave this place with Minnie. Remember! Don't say that You will be fine. You will be fine Remember, if you see Sonny is not growing at all leave him alone, don't investigate anything Don't let Sonny know you're having a baby You must promise me Promise me... I'm missing your wife again Mommy It's such a fine day Come Let's go swimming If I have to die, I'll finish you first! I'm scared! It hurts... It hurts! Mommy, Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... I'm so scared! Mommy, Mommy... Mommy, Mommy... Mommy, Mommy... On what condition would you let my family go? If they are stupid, I might let them go But if they are smart, it's hard to say I survived all these years on my own You think a mere floating platform... will scare me? Why did you pretend to be scared? If I were not scared, would you bring me out here? Do you know that I can easily kill you here? See how Mang can save you now! I never thought of asking Mang to come Mang is busy now Hazel? You don't look after your wife, who can you blame? Hazel Honey, Honey! I'm having a baby Honey! Honey!
