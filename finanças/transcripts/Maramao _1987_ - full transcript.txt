When telling a childhood memory, adults find it very embarrassing to dig in it. Always something is left out. La Testa. An animal that eats a lot, an elephant. No, because the elephant is afraid of the mouse. Better a mouse. No, even mom is afraid of mice. Then after dead mamma becomes an elephant mamma, a mammoth! Mamma after her death becomes an elephant mamma. And Dad? A baboon. Grandfather Nanni becomes a cat, Sandro becomes a donkey, has already been decided. And me? What will I become after death? A dog! Oooo! Bauuu! Bau! Barks, but a dog bit me. The Viper... gets entangled. A hornet, ant, mosquito, firefly... No, if they grab me I become 100 lire. The cow...Moo! If it "bellows" it's a bull. Giannino the bull. The deer...Uhuuu! And what does the deer? "Endearement." A bird! A Seagull. A seagull, a parrot, a blackbird... A Pheasant, a "piscivorous" bird. No, not "piscivorous", indeed! Owl! Yes, Giannino the owl. Meanwhile, let's see if I fly. Certainly, coming here makes me reborn. What a paradise! - And to think we've found it! - It was us from Turin, instead. No way! They were on the other side of the island, they came only to hunt. Come on, guys, it is useless to insist, it was us. Oh, how can it be, damn, I'm the only loser in the stock market from day one, I'll never make fortune! If you have a half a million helicopter, you can buy this island. - The helicopter is just a mask. - But you trip here in an hour, and when you want. He won't come with the helicopter. I'll be ashamed! You buy a four million helicopter, then you are ashamed? He did not know! I am ashamed. - They say he's lame. - Beware, do not goof. Once I goofed with Filippo's lady professor. - She has a glass eye and I... - I'll get 450 million for it, you'll see. Yes, I know. But I may change my mind. The kids had grown accustomed to this paradise. Where do you find a place like this? Sorry too, after twenty years, but... You want to fight against a bank all alone? If they want to buy, they buy. Let's enjoy this summer, then we'll sell the most expensive possible. The kids have grown, Filippo is not as excited as before. Where are you going with that raft? Because I wanted...There is a stream. To wait for Sandro to go... meet Patrizia. The raft... - You were able... - Get appart. - Let's go to the stream. - Kids, you have to wait for Sandro. Here's Sandro! Sandro, come. We will go meet Patrizia. - Where is Giannino? - I do not know, I have not seen him. Look, he did not come. - He didn't come? Now where is he? - Sandro! - Where is Giannino? - I do not know, I thought he was here. Sandro...Where is Giannino? I do not know, Dad, I was studying. - But, you fool!? You said you'll keep an eye on him. - Ah, no, no, I know where he is. I know... Giannino! Giannino, are you crazy? I had almost succeeded. Did you see how fast I was driving? You can not do it, it is impossible. I almost succeeded. If not for the wind, I would "take off". I was sure! If not for the wind, I'd "take off". Look, now they'll get angry at me! It hurts? - Yes, very much. - But if you tell mom you want to stay with me you must stay. You understand? - The guy from the French bank. - The one who will buy our house? I come for you... because Paolo and Chiara have gone to swim, they wanted to be alone. How many miles have you done? - Three. - By the way, 3 miles is a long way. Once... but I had frog legs, I did 500 meters. Do you want us to bath in the gutter? The water is clean there, but you are already bathed. It's clean. Three miles. An helicopter has landed. Did you know? Sandro has broken a leg. - When? - This morning. Not true. - Are you stupid? - Just kidding! We are very close. If he had broken his leg, I would be the first to know. In the morning he studies. How can he break a leg while studying? He was postponed, but that does not mean anything. Sandro is a smart kid. Even I was about to be postponed... But my father has sent a jug of oil to the teacher. Just kidding, multiple chioce questions. I'll take you to the riverside, so... Giannino, hurry! Maybe she likes me a little bit. Today, on the raft it seemed almost... - If you were me, what would you do? - Do not know. - You speak well of me to her? - Of course, I speak very well. What things you say? I say that you're nice, that you make the others laugh a lot, that you're a true rebel... that you answer back to the teachers, that you are a weird guy, a dangerous guy. What do you mean by "dangerous"? Sandro! Sandro! Sandro, how can you know where the wind comes from? - You use meters, flags. - No, what flags?. You do it so, look. The first side that dries, the way the wind comes. Look. Sorry, guys. Sorry. Can you tell me where is Mr. Lombardo or Lombardi's house? It is we, from Lombardi's house. You are his children? I have an appointment with your father. - C'mon, I accompany you, I know a shortcut. - Thank you, very kind. I'm late. - You do not come? - Come! - Well, then, see you soon, guys. - Bye. Arrivederci. As my name is Querci, Pippo Querci. Although you and I could never be brothers. I know. C'mon! Come on, faster! Faster? Look at this child! Please do not run. Is it true that you want to buy our house with everything inside? No, I want to buy the land. - Also the garden? - Yes - Even the street? But use can it be to you? - I must buy the whole island. - The entire island? - Yes - This place too? - Yes, this place too. - That too? - I must buy everything on the island. - Even the rocks? - Even the rocks. Take, I sell them to you. They're authentic stones from the island. They are beautiful. - How much cost your stones? - 10,000 liras. Damn! They are expensive. - Yes, they are authentic stones from the island. - Let's see... You're lucky, they are the last ones. And keep the stones, give them to me later. I put them here, because if you buy the island, it becomes your home. This is my home. For fifteen years we had came here. - Fifteen years? You how old are you? - Seven. My mother does not know what to do. She says that if we are left the two of us alone, what can we do? - My father will never sell, he's a passionate. - You'll see he will sell the first, right now. If yours sells, mine sells too. They are always together. Guys, my father does not start. I hope he will. I'm tired of being here, there's nothing around. I can not even bring the motor bike. I have the Cagiva, suit, helmet... - But I can not drive on holidays! - Being in your boots, I would tell him. Who? Your father. I would say: "Dad, I want to do motocross." "On the island there is no fun, no disco." "I'm bored." He'll sell right away. I told mine to do so. I told him: "Dad, before deciding think of Paolo, too." And he say? - Tell what he said, Paolo. - No, I can not. You tell him. You tell him, Chiara. Pippo, sorry. Guys, did he say? He said: "If you see Pippo Querci..." - If you see Pippo Querci? - "Greet him on my name." - Who's is the beer? - Mine. - Marino, they also bought you? - Do not worry, nobody buys me. We had thought of separating this building site from the other three... because it is the largest. It's located across the street. - Who is Querci? - It's him. It's me. It is bigger because we came first, twenty years ago, when nobody was here. - Well, those of Turin were here. - You said they were here? They came to hunt. - But they were here. - The true pioneers of the island are we. - Anyway, they came first. - No, we talk of installement. - Gentlemen, I have two separate bids. - What do you mean? You're a dog. For the lots of Innocent, Di Floro and Lombardi, 5,500,000 francs. At current exchange rates this is 1,200,000 liras, to be divided in three shares. For the Querci's lot, only for the reasons we said... You're a dog. - We offer 2,200,000 francs. - At today's exchange rate, how much is it? At today's exchange rate, he said, it's about 480 million liras. 480,000,000? I must second thought. If I get a "little million" I sell even the raft! - Franco, take the guitar. - Yes, yes! Oh, beautiful lady, hello! - You look a lot like your father. - What? You look a lot like your father. - On the nose? - No, in the nature, how you both have fun. - Tell me the truth. You can't wait anymore, right? - To what? To organize a party with all your friends, to drinki, to sing. Last year for my birthday we organized a pi?ata. You were ill. We had fun. And driving? You would like to be eighteen and drive the car... to go to the college with the car. Yes, I would like, but do not know whether I'll do the university. Tell me something. How long have not you cried? Me? It may be... very long. Three years, three years and a half. And you? - No, I still want sometimes to do it... - So what? I want to do it sometimes, too... Patrizia! - If you my mother looks for me... - I'll take care. Tonight I can stay up late. Should I ask her now? Sandro? You tell her, ask her if she likes me. - Would you come with me? - Where? To see what Paolo and Chiara are doing. - I know what they're doing, Chiara told me. - What did she told? - She told me of that moment. - What moment? The moment that arrives and... - One understands by itself, you feel it. - You look a lot like your mother. How long since you last cried? - Very long. And you? - Not long ago. - I look like Giannino. - So what? I cried too recently. I also look like Pippo Querci. Shooting stars, where they fall from? - Want to know exactly? - Yes Well, if you ask me exactly where from, exactly... I do not know. There is no specific point. It's like... like... sort of phenomenon. - Giannino, is something that is studied in fifth grade. - You do not know! Why not try with Pippo? - Try what? - To know if the moment has arrived. You...are...idiot. I... I give a shit... for the moment. So? Have you asked her? What did she say? That this was not the moment. - What did he say? - That this was not the moment. Sandro, you become a donkey because you have failed in math. Pippo Querci becomes a pork, Paolo and Chiara become pigeons. - Why pigeons? - For they lull. - Patrizia becomes sea dolphin. - Dolphin. - After my death what will become of me? - Do not know, you have to choose. I would like to become a cat, but this is already grandfather Nanni. - You really believe that this is grandfather Nanni? - Yes, the day he died... I found the cat. It all fits perfectly. The lizard and the ass get along? - Do not know. Why? - Because maybe I will become lizard. Look. You like it? Have you seen how he moves by jumps? I look the same? The same! I have not decided. Marino says that if someone grabs me by the tail... - it gets off. - Well, we'll think about it tomorrow. Now go sleep. It's late. Do not tell dad nor mom. Do not worry, but tomorrow better hide the box. If mom sees it, she'll make a fuzz. Turn off the light, sleep. Sleep. Maybe the Turin guys did it. On the island there's only us and them. - Why should they? - Maybe they were angry on me because I've sold. I think it was you and you can not remember. You drank too much wine. Sure, do laugh, do laugh! - Who has buried it here? - Do not know. It has not buried by itself. - Hopefully it will not fall down. - Giannino, get away, there is wind. How do you get it out? I made a hole near the water, then I took it and... Under the sand, with a huge shovel! With all my strength I have drawn it and... Filippo! Call Marino, tell him to bring a shovel, or else it don't comes out. - Yes, okay. - I've thrown it in and then... I come too. No, call Sandro, so he sees it as well. Hurry. Okay, I'm coming. But you do not remove it until we get back. Run! Run! - Sandro! - Look, it doesn't get off loose. - But if it had get off? - Does not get off, test it. - No, save it again! - Marino teased you. You should not always believe everything they say, you must believe me. - Why did you come home? - I came to tell you about the raft. The raft? What happened? It has been buried. Hurry, before they get it out. - Buried? And where? - It has been buried by the sea. - And who did it? - It is not known. - We must hurry. - Run! Hurry, Giannino! Come on! So, what if it got off? What if it got off? Marino said he had come tonight and he is average crazy. He is not average crazy, he has said he is totally crazy. I think it was him. -Hey, no one there? -Hey,"Bad thoughts"! Come on, guys, may have not been him. - When did you come? - Tonight. - You know that this island is private? - Yes Do you recognize this raft? - No. - So, who buried it? I do not know. - Stop, Paolo. - It should not happen again, understand? - Understand, Fogart? - I understand, sea ostrich... Shut up, he'll get mad! - If he gets angry, too bad for him. - Too bad for him? Too bad for us! That guy holds the reins, the whip! You saw that face? That guy has knives, guns! But if he shoots, he sinks. Zoff! I am Zoff! Shot, Sandro! - Sorry. I'll spike the ball! - Forget it, they are only kids. Go and play beyond. You too, Giannino! Shot, Pippo! Guys, I do not say it again, I catch it and I spike it! Get out now! - Now my turn. - Look, I'm not kidding. Understand? - Sandro, are you ready? - Yes! - Giannino, shot softly. - Tip shoot. Now, enough! You are rude. I said I'll spike it... and I will, really. Enough games, game over! I said that I would puncture it, and I will. Do not get angry, be patient, they are children. No! Good manners must be taught. Sandro, you're crazy? Do not get mad, I came to apologize. Apologies? What madness is this? - I know it was not you who buried the raft. - Raft? What raft? Marino told Pippo...is it true that you've been around the world two or three times? Yes - The fish, where have you catched it? - Here below, last night. - We had not catch even one. What bait do you use? - Fish. - With small fishes I do catch the large ones. - We did not catch even small ones. - You who? - My father... What is that story of the raft? It's Paolo, who does not understand... But how do you catch them so big? With the cane. I throw the hook with the bait and wait. I wait till they pull, and when they do, I pull harder, and I catch them. - Why, how you do it? - We does it with the fishing net. Well, with the net... - You must use cane. - Mr. Querci catchs a lot with the fishing net. Then ask him. I fish with a rod. And then you eat them? Holy Virgin! Your father hasn't taught you anything? Right, I fish them first and then I eat them. In what world do you live? It is very difficult to go around the world? No so difficult, because it is round. Like this... understand? But if it was flat... When it was flat it was difficult. When they thought that it was flat it was extremely difficult. So difficult that no one did. But on second thought, with some strings...understand? With a pulley... It could be... No, not possible. You know how to drive a sailboat? Me? - Those are sharks? - Go straight or else I'll slap a shark in your head! - How do you do to go straight? - Going straight! Take wind. - We are going backwards! - Do not worry, it's the bulb. Fulvio? Fulvio who? The bulb...Aho, what are you doing? Hey, I want to go home. - Turn, there are rocks. - And how do you do to turn? Coming. Rest. Give me the helm. As a sea wolf you're useless. You like to drive? Yes - Now you drive, I have things to do. - Do not leave me alone, I'm affraid! - My, it is great! - Should I know, I spent a life doing this. - You're not afraid to be alone? - No. No, not affraid. When I was at home with family, friends,... sometimes I did. Perhaps I agreed an appointment at a precise time, at nine in Gianduiotto... - Eh? - Gianduiotto. The bar, oh! Came in five minutes late and the others had gone... to have fun, and I was left alone and crying. Or, at night, in bed, everybody was sleeping and you can't. Then I was scared. At sea, when you're awake, nobody sleeps. Do you mean? There may be a boat full of people sleeping! At sea, in the ocean? Not likely. There's no one to do so. Perhaps the whales, or maybe the dolphins. You are afraid of storms, of coral reef. Once I crashed. You do not see them, but so are there two, three, four. - Two plus seven? - Nine. - Easy. Thirteen plus three? - Sixteen. Easier. Try to count the numbers based on sixteen. - Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen... - Stop, that's not the right way. You do not try, do not make any effort. Try to count the numbers by selecting each one, one by one. How...choosing them? - You said that numbers are infinite? - Yes Then you can choose them. Start at a number that suits you, any one. - Zero? - Bravo! Go on. Thirty-one. - Bravo! Another. - 700. - Go! Once more! - A million and a half. - Go on, once more! - One million eight hundred thousand! - Go on! - One billion, 10 billion, 25 billion... Enough, enough, 25,000 million. But, you know long it would take you to reach 25 billion... if you had counted no choosing as you have done? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...it would take two or three days. You have to count up to 25,000 million, and someone says "Stop." And you, 25 billion! How long did it take? I'll ask you a problem similar to that they ask you at school. If a man needs 1,000,000 to pay the last installment of his boat. Of what use is to him to have the first 100, 200, 300,000 lire? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Result: nothing. The solution of the problem is one and only one: 1,000,000. - I need 1,000,000 lire. - And who gives you 1,000,000? Bravo! That's another problem. In fact, I hope...yes, but now tell me about a problem of yours. A school one? - Whatever, you surely have one. - Yes Go ahead. I wonder why this year they asked me to care for Giannino but not last year. What has changed? And why they have to sell the house?, Who cares if it's a good business? And why Chiara and Paolo behave that way? Why is Pippo Querci in love, why Patrizia says the "moment" has come, what "moment"? Certain things make me ashame. Also in school I am always embarrassed when they ask me and I get a good note. When I speak English, I am ashamed, but they do not, they have no shame anymore, they like it. They have changed, and they believe I've changed too... as if it was required. Is it? - Solution. How old are you? - Fourteen. The solution to the problem is only one: fourteen. Well, what should I do? You're still young, do not get caught up, escape. - Tomorrow? - Yes, at dawn. He said he'll wait to meet me. And when you come back? When we go through here, because the earth is round. - And the test? - The review, who cares about the test? You've seen so many guys that teach you to count: one, two, three, four, five. - But, where are you leading to? - And your father and your mother? My father and my mother... My father and mother are no problem, they'll get used, even Giannino will. How will they get used? Getting used. Try one of these days go visit them. "Good morning, madam, any news on Sandro?" "Sandro is going around the world, among the whales, in Calcutta." "He'll return when the wind changes." Even at school, you will see at check in. Alessandro Lombardi. Absent. Justification? Justification? Whales, yes, justification: whales. - And you? - Me what? Pippo Querci, justification? - Family affairs. - You see what difference it makes not to go? Our parents have not seen whales, for them it is not important. But I, tomowrrow... Among the whales. Justification: whales. And our blood pact? Should not we do everything together, be together forever... even as adults? Look, Pippo, now if I stay here, we can not be friends anymore. Why? Look, you've changed, and you do not even have noticed. You're in love. And if I go too? How stupid, I had not thought of! Ssssh! - Are we going? - I can not, my throat hurts, I have a fever. I can not swallow. - I knew you could not come. - What do you want of me? With fever I can not leave. Can you wait a week for me? Goodbye. Get well soon. - Pippo? - Yes? I wanted to tell you of the raft. No, nothing. Jerry! Guys, let's play a game? grownups versus small ones. Force against brain!. Let's see if they learn something. When I played for Virtus they used to call me "spanker", I used to make 140 in a row! Ready? - Watch Filippo! - Pass it! Lombardi, watch below! Bravo, that's it. Come on! - Ridalla! - Come on, shoot now, come on! But, if they never pass me the ball! - Come on, Pippo! - Enclose him! Enclose him! - You had to lock him up! - What could I do? I was watching only one! - Go ahead, come on! - Dribble! Shoot! - No! - Why did you not take it? - Ready? - Come on! Come on, Sandro! Come in again, everybody! - Hold him back! Hold him back! - Come on! - Come on! - What are you doing? With your hands? - Pass the ball! - Come on, go down, that way! - Damn, I don't play no more! - What happened? Already tired? Ay! - What happened? - Let's see. Holy Virgin, what has he done! - Oh... - Dad! - It's broken. - No, it's just the beat. Sandro, you're crazy? You did it on purpose. - And you also buried the raft, right? - Yes, on my own. - You and Pippo Querci, he told me. Go to apologize! Bring the gift yourself and see what you've accomplished with all the excitement! You never think about the consequences, you do not care about anybody! You bring the gun, I'm embarrassed to go! Bring this too. Because of you he won't be able to use the gun! The only gift we can bring him is a bottle of whiskey! - Can I go too? - No, he must go on his own. Donald Duck, where are you going? - Where are you going with the gune and the bottle? - To apologize to Mr. Querci. I thought you were one of those who never apologize to anyone... But... you're like Donald Duck, you rebel out and then you regret. Runaway! You say you'll travel around the world, but then you're afraid and you will not. - Pippo told you? - Who told me was... Daffy Duck. Think, now someone is watching the whales. Splash, splash! Instead you lower your head and say: "Sorry, I didn'd do it on purpose" He forgives you and everything is fixed. You start doing things because you like them, but then you got afraid... and stop doing them, like Donald Duck. Not like Donald Duck, as Paperinik! Sorry, I'm sorry I made you lame. What can I give you? Maybe I exaggerated a little... but when I see a hairy leg like yours... I do not know! I can not resist. But you were shooting to Giannino. You can not do certain things on my face. When I play football I'm a locomotive, trampling everything. Either way, I'm sorry, at heart, even for the raft. I do not know why I buried it. Perhaps for the sake of beauty. My father had given you this, but, on my fault... you can not use it. Who knows how many fish you would have caught! I'm sorry, really. No! Just as he wanted, 10 atmospheres. This runs through the walls. Remember! Yeah, yeah, okay! Mom and Dad come to dinner tonight. Thanks for the cake. - Well? Has he forgiven you? Imagine if you had broken him a leg! Among the disasters, it has been better this way. If I had done that, you would not see me until Christmas. Now, to match, you should break his father's leg. And yes! That way it would never end! Giannino breaks mine, Chiara's father breaks Paolo's leg, Marino breaks... - I have to go. See ya! - See you tonight. - No, I can not come, I am punished. - But you do come? No, I can not either, I am punished. - But how can it be you're punished, why? - Because my mother punished me. Bye, see you. Looks good! Now you get punished like that, without a reason. Just tonight, when there was a party! So who remain? Me, Paolo and Chiara. After a while, Paolo and Chiara go. So, kids... What kids remain? Me alone. Are you crazy? Do you want to wake up my mother? Shut up, I put on my shoes and off we go. - Enough! - That way you'll wake my mother! - You're going to make her angry! - Off we go right away! No, Sandro, not now, let's go off. See? Does not change anything. Now bury me...and pray for me. She was the best of all us... how she used to swim, to float. Everybody liked her. You might ask: "Why her?" And I tell you: because. I remember her most beautiful moments, the moments we spent together. I remember she used to spray her hands with glue... blow on them, and when they dry she had fun pulling off the shell. He loved the full-backs' smell, the spirited ones. She used to pent hours smelling rather than studying. When they asked the lesson she used to scratch the blackboard... and made the chalk to screech on. I like to remember her that way. That way, no wrinkles, no dark circles, without the "celluloid." Without old age as well. If you agree, I had an idea! Let's embalm her! But...she loved mostly Giannino. She died before learning the most important thing. Giannino finally chose his animal. What one did he choose? Run, come! Sitting. Lie. You're afraid, right? Now I feed you. - I'll take another bath! - No, you can't! - I want to take another bath! - You can not! - Why? - I said no! You have eaten, you understand? I just want to take another bath! - I only took two! - After lunch you die if you swim! - Sandro, you tell him he can not. - Sandro, do not come! You can not swim, the water is cold! Also, you've just eaten! - Let me! - You have a sandwich in hand, you can not swim! But who do you think you are, his mother? What do you care if he swims or not? But are you crazy? I do it for you. Then if something happens to him... the responsibility is yours! He has just eaten. He has just eaten, and then what? You always swim after eating. Why will not he? Want to swim, Giannino? Come, I'll take you. No, Sandro, let him off. He must not swim. - Oh yeah? And who objects? - I, I forbid! Come on, try it now, try it! Come on, Sandro, you can shoot by accident. Come on, do not get mad! It does not fire if you do not pull the trigger, I'm no fool! I just swim after eating. Because it's not true that it hurts you. See, Giannino? Nothing happens. As the lizard that was not leaving the queue, you are a shit! You do not understand! I do not care what's wrong, but you stay only if you do scenes! Sandro! - What are you looking? - No, nothing... Buh! - What are you doing here? - No, no, nothing. Do not worry, yeah? Smoke? Yes, I smoke. do not worry. - I watched? - No, I tell you something important. - Then come, let me know. - No, I'm out. Pippo, what's wrong? You like Sandro, you see, you understand. There is nothing wrong, by contrast, is good, cute, intelligent. He has been postponed, but if you like, you like. I was wrong, I thought you and me...I thought you liked me. I was wrong, there's nothing wrong with that. Sandro and I are good friends, as Chiara and you, that says it all. - I also have told us. - From us, what? Exactly, nothing! Because I was wrong. So he is not coming to get you to the raft when you swim. The raft is mine, but it soon, we're friends, there is nothing wrong. This morning, I understood why Sandro was so strange, my fault, but... now I say, I was wrong. You see, he'll take on the raft. Went out. You might wonder what I will. Well, I...do you want? Sandro thought I was in love, but no. I have my things, fishing, rifle. Because the network, with my father in that state, too...You'll see, everything will be fine. You know I do not like to look worried. If for exams, stay calm... everything will be fine. If nothing else, say, do not keep it inside. I'm here for that. Even your mother has noticed. I would like...I think I look like a strange and distant. Not so, I want to be close, especially if you have any problems. Do not think about being alone. Understand? I know, but...I do it on purpose. You have nothing to do, nor mother. But you must understand, you look so strange, with dark circles, I do something, no? Is that I...well...I want...Well, I guess I should apologize. But, how, what's wrong, you should not apologize, what matters is that you are well. - Money, Money! - Let me see. Look, Dad! We fish money. Bravo, Giannino! Let's see... Yes, well, looks good! Tickets are 100,000 lire. A million, exactly one million. A million! It's mine, I found myself! We buy a helicopter? A helicopter... Who will lose? Perhaps a boat. It's strange. What do you guys? - Devolv?moslo the sea. - Are you crazy? I found myself. Truth, Daddy? If you find something in the sea is yours, right? First we must ensure that he has not missed any of the island. Yes, indeed, throw donkey is the sea. - Zoff! - See what you heard from the street. Zoff! What have I done? Stop playing. Stop playing! I do what I did? Come on, answer, tell me what have I done! Do you drink? Bebo. And do I care? If you like, drink. I drink it all myself. - What have you bought lately? - Nothing. I paid the rifle to Querci, oysters Marino, and nothing else. It seemed he had brought more money. - Everything costs double. - I know, but we must be more careful. I call Mom? What are you doing awake? And you? I...Do not worry about me. Why do not you sleep? At night you sleep. And why do not you sleep? Because I have no sleep and am also higher. Come back to sleep. And where have you been? - I was out I was wrong. - Dress Indian? Yes, Indian, to vomit. - So you want to call mom? - No, no, do not call anyone! - So tell me where you've been. - Okay, okay, I'll tell you the truth. Look, I...I can not sleep, I stay awake, I must protect everyone, including you. I watch that all is well. - Dress Indian? - You have not understood anything. I am a warrior, I have seen and to scare them when they come. - Who, The Skeletor? - Yes skeletons. - The Skeletor, the masters of the universe. - Yes, the same. They are afraid of the Indians. It is the only way to drive them... I protect the island from invasion. - I am Indian and I saw myself. - No, it is very dangerous. - So tell mom. - Okay, I'll take with me, but it's a secret. - He swears he will not tell anyone, swear! - I swear. What food! To remove it would need a week. - There were more than ten kilos of fish. - Fresh fish has a different flavor. You teach me how to do that sauce, we must repeat. - You know the fish and I do not get along. - It was delicious! I ate too much, I loose. - Marta, no more whiskey? - There are two or three bottles. Well! For me not to worry... - I helped clear the table. - What food, guys! No, no, listen. Go, go get some whiskey, go! Let's go. - Oh! But there is no more. How is that possible? - I've taken it all. Between parties, dinners and birthdays, it turns out you get drunk every day. It's strange. I'll make coffee. Come on. Giannino, go to bed, eh? And sleep! Sandro, do sleep. Yes! But now sleeps, eh? Yes, but you have to read me some "Mickey Mouse". I read it. "Mickey Mouse and the Bull of the cow that speech." "Look, Mickey, the talking cow. Come." "Hey where are you?" Cow says he speaks. "Moo! This field can only enter the cows." Giannino and fell asleep! Justification: Whales. Sandro. "At home, when everyone is asleep," "Everyone is asleep and you do not." "There was fear." Hello. Why do not you sleep? Everyone sleeps. "The End of the Whale" Two letters. Yo. Go swimming? I dare you. - From here to the coast. - Boom! You bet. I get to the coast. Well, you lose. Are you ready? - So you're ready or not? - Wait! Wait! Hear that? - You hear it or not? - No. Wait, close your eyes. He who comes last is an ass! Sandro? Sandro? Sandro! Sandro! Whatever you need, you know, you can count on us. Yes, I know, but now... - I'm with you. - Never mind, let's go. - Yes, it is better, so I drive the car. - The car does it matter? Why...I want to know why! Come, spirit. - No fair! - Must be strong. Congestion on the island fucking shit! Calm down. Go with them and driving the car. With the cast I can not. - I told you, but do not want. - Stay close to Marta. You must do everything in the house, at least initially. - It's terrible... - Do not worry, I talk to Enzo. Marta, lean on me. I'm going with you, and drive the car. Giannino, come to mama! I never give up! Giannino, where are you going? Why are not you with your parents? You have to be with them, you are a man. You must be strong. Sandro would not want to see you mourn, he would not cry. He gives the example. I do not understand exactly what happened to him. It is not fair. Sandro was my best friend. Goodbye, I'm going! - I'm going, and you? - I do not. You're not going to swim? - I do not know, maybe later. - But you do not know what is congestion? - Even I know. But you do not you go too? - I do not know, to make ends meet, as usual. Then go. - Giannino I call you by phone this winter. - Me? Yes, you. I call you by phone. But you say, "Is Giannino?", But do not give me the phone. Goodbye, dolphin of the sea! Dolphin? Sandro! Sandro! Sandro! Sandro! I knew it was you! I knew it! We were going to leave without you. Everyone was crying. I let go of the lizard, I did well? It was not me, I understand. The snakes eat lizards, it is better to be snake. You get along with snakes? Now, where we put you? In the garage there is room. I got a ball to inflate it using a needle. I on the arch and you pull. But the petty, right? Ah, Skeletor! So many, myself have seen. Patrizia said I will phone this winter. I hope you call me later, I'm at school tomorrow. I'm going to dress up an Indian every day, so we will be more peaceful. Aren't you hot with all this hair? We could cut it off a bit. Thanks, from my very heart, grandfather Nanni, grandmother Sinna, grandfather Gigi, heaven had taken you away.
