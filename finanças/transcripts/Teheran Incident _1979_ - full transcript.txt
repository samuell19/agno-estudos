(speaking Russian) (gunshot) (scream) (car engine revs) (rapid gunfire) (screaming) (speaking Russian) (phone ringing) -We celebrate. Mm hmm. -Champagne? Ringo. Champagne. Am I invited to the party? We just received word on negotiations we've been involved in. Obviously you got your way again. Obviously. Would you excuse us? We have a few details to discuss. After the champagne. Nina. Except for Edward, everything is exactly as you'd planned, but doesn't it bother you that we caught an American diplomat snooping around the warehouse? It would have bothered me a great deal more if we hadn't caught him. Forget that one. He's just a minor official. Besides, we'll soon know what he was doing here. Do you think he heard about the fifty million at Teheran Bank? Stop speculating about Atwood. He might have stopped at the warehouse because he couldn't find the men's room! Could have been hundred reasons, none having to do with us. Oh, thank you, Ringo. Nina! Business is over. To one week from today. What happens one week from today? If you knew that, my dear, you would know a bit too much. Would that tongue-less hulk really kill for you? He has. And he will again. The thought of a man without a tongue makes me feel uncomfortable. It's nice to know that something can bother you. You never will. You can be sure of that. Enough. Tell the skipper to get on the way. He's a big boy now. To me, he's un-expendable. By day, or by night? -Does it disturb you? -Nina: (laughs) Not at all. Well, it's been a long day. I think I'm going to take a nap. Coming? Is he coming to the cabin with us? Well, it's comforting to know that his left arm is with me at all times. But you won't tell me why. I hope you never have occasion to find out. Man, you're too much. If you don't care about your face, Atwood, think about my hand. It's starting to hurt. Now. Talk. Okay. (grunting) Hey. He stays alive. Maybe when the Baron gets through with him... ...he'll give him back to you. Toni and I have some business, we'll join you in the office. Good evening, Dr. Nikolaeff. How soon? The only thing about unpredictables is that they are predictable. Every unpredictable delay has happened: breakdowns, incompetence, in both men and machines. You have seven days. Precisely seven days to accomplish your work. Nikolaeff: I am aware of it. Well, this is good, ability of competence is better. Someday it will be ready. How soon could you complete your work for the remote control guiding system, if you had the prototype? Forty-eight hours, perhaps less. So I can have the assurance that your work can be completed within 48 hours? Well, the prototype shall arrive in less than eight hours. I don't understand. You don't have to. Did the Baron say anything about me? Arthur, you are paranoid. Every time I see you, the same question. "Did the Baron say anything about me?" Are you really concerned with what the Baron says about you? Yes. And how's that for a nice simple, direct answer? (door opening) Good evening, Baron. Arthur, I reviewed last week's courses. You're doing well. Arthur: Thank you, Baron. (chattering in foreign language) Mm-hmm. Not a bad house, for this time of the night. Well, I think I'll try my luck, Rex. No markers, use your own money this time. Atwood, the gentleman snooping in the warehouse, I would like to talk to him. Of course, Baron. George? It might be better if you were not here while I chat with Atwood. I understand. You've been at the tables again, Arthur? So far I count 18,000. How much? 32. You may leave. I'm starting to worry about him. You needn't concern yourself, you have all of my worries. Not yours. So, how it go? Perfect. We'll deliver the Russian missile to the Baron in about eight hours. It's a beauty. It'll blow that peace conference on Phoenix to hell and back. Did the 50 million arrive? Yeah, it's in the bank in Teheran. (gunshots) Did you get anything out of Atwood? No, he made a break for it. I had to, uh, kill him. Kill him? You stupid moron! You know the Baron's orders. No mistakes. Understand? Hey, wait a minute. I had to kill him. What else could I do? he was getting away. Listen to me. I had no choice. Alec! Masters wants to see you. Something just came in. Hi, Alec. Can't it wait a couple hours? Hello, Alec. Thanks for the workout, Mike. No question about it, Alec. It was Atwood. His prints checked against those circulated by Interpol a few days ago. His pockets were clean, and the Iranian police are satisfied that the motive was robbery. Alec: Do you buy that? Alec, we've got enough problems in the Middle East. In case you need reminding, any time any one of us clears the continental limits of the United States, our only official capacity is "Embassy Liaison." Is that clear? Yes. We don't know what business took Atwood from his desk at Teheran to Abadan. We had to assume it was private business. Nothing else. Understood? That the way you want it? That's the way State wants it. Ah. Then it's settled. You'll be booked on tonight's flight for Teheran. You, of course, will be replacing Atwood. The situation is very delicate. Their Heads of State will be meeting for peace talks in the Middle East, and you are to do nothing, do you understand? Nothing to disturb that. Atwood's death was not connected, so leave it alone. And check in with the ambassador as soon as you get there. How did Atwood get it? Shot in the back of the head. They found him floating in the gulf. Doesn't say much, does he? Only when it's important. If I know Alec, you can be sure he'll take an "unofficial" look. ( tires screeching) -Mr. Franklin? -Yes. Welcome to Teheran. There's a Sergeant Jackson waiting for you when you clear immigration. -Thank you. -It's a pleasure. (indistinct chattering) Franklin? Sergeant Jackson. We're running a little bit late, sir. If you'll give me your baggage I'll take it to Corporal, and they can take care of you here. Whoa, slow down a minute, son. I'm sorry, sir, but your plane is ready to take off. Well, you tell them to go right ahead. (indistinct chattering) Toni. The Baron was right. I see. Hold on. Baron? Yes? A U.S. Air Force lieutenant met someone at the Teheran airport, but he went off alone. Oh, so my information seems to be correct, that they were replacing Atwood at the Embassy. Well, let's be sure he's just that. Have Ringo and George go to the shuttle service airport, just in case. There's only one more flight to Abadan tonight, 9:00. And if he tries to board... ...time is too short to take chances. Hello, George? Yes, right, you got it. (indistinct newscast on the radio) Alec: Wait. News vendor: Teheran Chronicle, get your Teheran Chronicle! Ayatollah Khomeini, a new threat to the Shah in Iran. Security tight for peace conference. Twenty followers of Ayatollah Khomeini jailed in Abadan prison. What do I owe you? That'll be only 1,000 rials for the ride. And I figure for the sightseeing tour, 2,000. Since you plan on retiring, I guess you don't mind taking U.S. dollars. No, sir! That'll be 50 dollars American. I've been here before. Ah, 35 dollars? Would you believe 20? (sigh) News vendor: Teheran Chronicle, get your Teheran Chronicle... Hey mister, wait a minute. Carry your bags? What, do you think you're big enough? Good. Hold it. Turn around. Alec: What would the Chamber of Commerce say if they knew how you greeted the tourists? George: Shut up. Hold it. All right. Move. No funny stuff. Keep moving. There you are. Hey, you no like those friends who pay me to carry bags? (laughs) It's all right, son. Thanks. (airplane engine starts) He must be more than a diplomat. No milquetoast barring the best embassy attaché... ...could take care of George and Ringo. All right, Baron, all right. We'll run another check. But to date, all of our information is like fact. He is an attaché. He is an attaché, he puts away two of our men, and is on his way here, while he should be on his way to the conference on Phoenix. And that's all he is, an embassy man. He'll be spotted as soon as the plane sets down. He'll be under constant surveillance. We'll know every move he makes, every place he goes. He is in our town. Is there any more on the information we received about the Russian agent arriving in Teheran? Toni: We're checking it out. Checking it out, checking out. I don't need it checked out, I want to know. Now. You understand? (sigh) (Speaking Farsi) Take care of my luggage, please. Welcome to Abadan. Thank you. I'd like a room, please. Would you wait a moment, please? Yeah. Diplomatic passport. Legal attaché in Teheran? Mm-hmm. Do you have a reservation, Mr. Franklin? No, I'm sorry, I don't. Okay. Give me five or ten minutes. I'm sure I will find something nice at diplomatic rates. I might even pay to get transferred. Why don't you wait in the bar? I'll have you called, okay? -Thanks. That's it? -Uh-huh. Man: Waiter? Bottle of Nuits Saint Georges for the man at the bar, please. Yes. Do you have a bottle of Nuits Saint Georges? Where'd that come from? Gentleman over there. Man: Alec. Konstantine, for God's sake. -Good to see you. -You too. Pour two of those. Here, sit down. Nuits Saint Georges, you've got a good memory. How about Patricia Tringham and Gladys Benton? Patricia and Gladys. Oh, yeah, I wonder whatever became of those two. Oh, I don't know, but if they're married now, it's a great loss to the single man. -(laughs) -Here's to them. I'll drink to that. You get more western every day, is that Saville Row? Naturally. You wear it in Red Square? Strictly for travel. (laughs) Say, aren't you a little off base, Alec? Shouldn't you either be in Teheran, or on your way to the conference? I have a little playtime before the summit. Concierge: Your suite is ready, Mr. Franklin. Thank you. I have a feeling we've got things to talk about. I'll meet you in an hour? Yeah. I must talk to you. Sit down. Outside. What is it, Galina? Who was that man you were talking to? Just an old friend. An American? I met him during the last summit. He was just assigned to the conference on Phoenix. Galina, you're an electronic and missile expert. Please remember that. And let me take care of my business. Is it possible, even remotely possible, that he's here to negotiate for the purchase of the missile? No. Konstantine, I don't understand you. Even if we don't know where, we do know that the stolen prototype is here. He's an American! I assure you Alec has nothing to do with the stolen prototype. Alec? Alec Franklin, that's his name. He's here just to find out one thing: who killed Atwood. May I make a supposition? If Alec Franklin were here to bargain for the missile, do you think just for one moment that his government would want it known? Obviously not. Konstantine, you're forgetting. We're trying to establish a new world order. I try to keep my work separate from politics. Yeah, but a principle is a principle. Of course. But you must recognize that there may be a lot of people who honestly do not believe in your world order, any more than you do in theirs. My world order? The years you spent in the embassy in America must have eroded your brain. There are really times I'm wondering if you're still Russian. What do you intend on doing about Alec Franklin? Nothing. Nothing? But remember: when it comes to what has to be done, I have no friends. Konstantine: I don't know, Alec. That's really not too much to go on. A gambling chip, the inscription of a name on the back of a watch. Alec: What about the Baron? His chip, his place. Konstantine: The man is in an international cartel, trading company, some shipping, electronics. He seems to be in everything. But as far as we know... ...he's clean. Legitimate. Never any talk? Well, there's always talk. But there's never anything you can lay at his door. And, he's got a lot of doors. You're trying to lay something at his door, aren't you? All right, Alec. I'll tell you this much. Obviously, I'm here on business. I've been following the trail from my country, across the Caspian Sea, to Teheran, and now here. Could Atwood's death be in any way tied in with what you're working on? Now, come on, I don't want all your secrets, but give me something, fill me in. The faith, the portent, it's devastating. Konstantine: A religious group headed by Ayatollah Khomeini is headquartered in Paris. The Ayatollah claims to be a messenger of Allah. He is uniting people against the Shah. The way it looks now, the Shah's days are numbered. You Americans will lose Iran, and then, who knows what will happen. Fifty million dollars came from that religious group and was deposited in the bank. Alec: In Teheran. Yes. Probably. In gold. How much? 50 million. Ooh. That's a nice round number I'll say. Yeah, but, to what purpose? Do you think the Baron and the secret account are the same? Konstantine: Well, if we knew that, we'd know a great deal more. As I said, they're still checking. A little bit ago, you said, "devastating." Now, Konstantine, wouldn't that only mean nuclear? We're not that far from the island of Phoenix. If an atomic missile drops into that conference, the assumption would be a crazy Russian or a crazy American triggered it. No time for questions, just instant retaliation in both directions. Doesn't make any sense. There'd be no real winner. Not in the aftermath. Well, there could be two. Two? Let's assume the secret bank account and the Baron are one and the same. He picks up a lot of money, and whoever financed this operation moves in and picks up the pieces. Like to gamble? We Russians have been gambling ever since Lenin stumbled across Marx. (indistinct chattering) The American? He's here. Who's the other one? No, I never saw him before. Thank you, George. I wonder what he's after. We'll soon find out. Can I get a straight answer? Straight as I can. Did Atwood's name come up in your investigation at all? Whatever the hell it is you're working on. The straight answer? No. His death was just a notation, a report that came across my desk. Gentlemen, care for some company? Perhaps later. We'll look forward to it. Welcome to the club. Name's Marchant. Baron Marchant, I am the owner of the club. Perhaps Mr. Glanert and I can show you around? We believe in taking good care of our guests. All of your guests? The special few. Thank you, Baron. Incidentally, you might have an opinion on something my friend and I have been discussing. Try, mister... Franklin. Alec Franklin. And this is Mr. Senyonov, Russian embassy. We were talking about flushing game into the open, especially when the season's running short. Would you say... it's best to go charging in after it, or to use some bait to worry it, and bring it into the open? I would say it depends on the size of the game, and how well it's equipped to defend itself. What do you think? Perhaps, perhaps. Of course, they do say that a mouse can panic an elephant. Probably, Mr. Franklin. But I think you missed the real point. First, the mouse has to find the elephant, doesn't it? (laughing) Talking about games, there should be one out there to interest you... ...and your friend. Konstantine, why not? I for one always liked pushing my luck. Yes, I won this the hard way. Not at the roulette table, but in a fruit market in Teheran. I find it hard to believe that an American diplomat and a Russian agent are working together. Believe it, Toni, believe it. At least we know what we are up against. Good performance, Alec. But was it smart to show our hand? No, my hand. He still can't be too sure who you were. Banking on his ego, you plant a seed, and he has to do something. When he does, I hope he'll expose their weak side. And we'll around to follow it. One of us better be. (indistinct chattering) Oh, oh, oh! No? Let me help you. Thank you so much. No, thank you. It's not every day I get to pick up a beautiful lady's pearls. How sweet. It's a pleasure. Now, what do we do with these? Uh-huh. One over there, on red, and seven. Hello. Later is now. Okay, sit down. Thought I'd turn the tables for awhile. Join me? Sure, I'll be a good left hand. Couldn't ask for a better one. How do you like working for the Baron? Oh, I only met him once, when I first started to work here. Actually, I work for Mr. Stetson. Stetson? Yes, the manager of this casino. Play 1,000, will you, Charlie? Didn't you hear me? Yes, sir, Mr. Stetson, but-- But what? The Baron's in downward number credit. As long as I'm the manager of this casino, you'll give me the cash I ask for. I'm sorry, Mr. Stetson, but you know we can't disregard an order from the Baron. I'm sorry, but you'll have to excuse me. Wait, my card, in case you care to see me later. Sometimes... Thank you. Mr. Stetson? Perhaps you'll permit me to buy you a drink. Talk over your financial situation. You won again! Oh, I've never been so lucky! Alec. Why don't we leave? We can't go home on a lady's money! First time I've ever been turned down when I asked a man to leave with me. I didn't say I wouldn't leave with you, I just said not on your money. (laughing) Maybe I'll get lucky and I lose so we can leave. All right, there. (laughing) We lose. We lose. Hey, Toni. Take a look at this. What is it? Stetson. A man who is the manager of a casino whose credit has been cutoff, there's only one problem. Money. That's my business. While I don't have unlimited resources, I might be able to help you. Let's get to the bottom line. Okay, I need money. What have I got that you want? I'm looking for a man. A very important man. A Russian. How much money? Sufficient. I'll be back in a minute. All right. I think I may know the man you're looking for. If you can tell me his name, we can deal. Nikolaeff. We deal. You're wanted in the office, Mr. Stetson. Nina: Ready? Sorry, Nina. Tell the Baron it could've been fun. Keep moving. You take the right, I've got the left! Wheel's rigged, it's crooked! Oh! -What the hell's going on here? -Stetson, the manager. We've gotta get him out of here. Which one is he? I don't see him. (gasps) Nina: Alec, look out! -Thank you. -(Nina screams) (sirens blare) (screams) (whistles blowing) Oh, Mr. Franklin. You've run into some excitement, I see. Oh! That's one way of putting it. Has Mr. Senyonov come in? Oh, no, his key is still there. Well, ask him to call me as soon as he does, will you? -Of course. -Right, thanks. (music plays over radio) Please, close the door. It's drafty. (laughs) Drafty. I wonder why they bother with locks in this hotel. (laughs) It only took a hairpin. Thought I'd give you a chance to thank me. Nuits Saint Georges? Nuits Saint Georges. Nina, it's three AM It's been a tough day, and it's going to be a tough day tomorrow. Now, do we play question and answer, or did the Baron make you an offer I can't match? I came here on my own. It's strictly between the sexes: you and me, me and you. You and me, huh? I may not be an angel, but I'm not a liar. (laughs) Radio presenter: And now, for the latest news. Good morning, Iran. The Middle East peace conference starts tomorrow, on Keesh Island, as planned. Over 600 delegates representing 46 countries will participate. The first dignitaries, from Bahrain, Qatar, Sudan, and Kuwait, arrived yesterday at Teheran airport. Large scale security measures are in effect on the island, and in Teheran. Ayatollah Khomeini, in Paris, is threatening to disrupt, at all costs, the conference on Keesh Island-- It's no time for news, now. Whose side are you on? My own. 721, please. (knock on door) Coming. Where is Konstantine? Please, don't mar his beautiful body. (gasps) Easy, easy, easy. You're welcome, darling. What have you done with Konstantine? What's your connection with Konstantine? Who the hell are you? Oh, I know you. The electronics expert he brought with him. A-ha. Did he tell you that? No, they cabled me from Moscow. Now, listen, I've been trying to find Konstantine since I got in last night. He's missing, isn't he? Yes. His bed wasn't slept in. In the last conversation we had, he said he would keep an eye on you. I haven't seen him since he left the casino last night, with someone we both wanted to talk to. Both wanted to talk to? That's right, that missing missile of yours affects both our national securities. We decided to pool our efforts. But you are an American. Terrific. And now, we're playing on the same team. May I? I'm Galina Fedorovna. Galina, Konstantine and I have different flags, but our schools are the same. Now, would you go to your room and wait for me? I think I know where we can find Konstantine. Put the gun away, stick to electronics, will you? You pick some strange friends. No, I'm getting the feeling some strange friends are picking me. Let's go back to bed. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we can't do that. I have a wonderful idea. Why don't we fly to Istanbul for a few days? Istanbul, huh? No, now, listen... ...how about the island of Phoenix? Phoenix? There's never anything going on in Phoenix. It's the dullest place I know. It might not be after tomorrow morning. We'll have fun. I promise you. Oh, you promise, do you, huh? What did the Baron promise you for last night? He suggested I meet you. That's all. What happened is because I wanted it to happen. Oh, that's a nice performance, Nina. Did he turn you on to Lee Atwood, too? Atwood? Who's he? Oh, just somebody your playmates put a bullet into. Before they tossed him in for a swim. Believe me, I don't know anything about that. How about the man I was with last night, Konstantine? Time is running out, Nina, Iran is smoldering, and all hell is about to break loose! -Well? -Nothing. Konstantine is a clam. He just passed out again. Is that so? The boys are still okay. Well, I'm gone for 20 minutes. I spent 10 years teaching you, but then you stupidly tried to pull them off on someone in the carpet club? Couldn't you wait? Until he was outside? I think Nina was right. You don't have it. Did she get back yet? But I wouldn't say she was exactly helpful last night. She's much smarter than all of you, at least she knew she couldn't get anything out of someone with a cracked skull. Now we have to know if that Russian got anything out of Stetson... ...that could have been passed on. There wasn't time for Stetson to tell him anything. It took three of us to nail Konstantine. By that time, Stetson was gone. Ten seconds would have been enough! Toni, so help me, if you cost me that mountain of gold-- A rabbit like Stetson won't stay-- You never know what a scared man will do. But let's try that Russian clam again. (water splashing) Why make it rough on yourself, Senyonov? Nikolaeff recognized you. That defecting traitor. Look at the man this way: a brilliant scientist who also happens to like money. Is that your excuse for living? Money? What did Stetson tell you? Does Franklin have any other man in town? You're a fool. A Russian agent, and yet you're willing to let an American agent steal your missile. You will talk. You may as well kill me now. Dying isn't going to be that easy. Look. He lost three fingers and half a palm in a fight, and I improved on nature. Behind this rubber glove, there is Swedish steel where there used to be human tissue. Oh no, not for you. That would be the easy way. We'll try the hard way. Interesting, isn't it? Tough enough to penetrate metal, or play with flesh, or bones, depending on how he feels or what I order him to do. Think about it. You have 20 minutes. Well, Nina. Call him off. Stop. Against the wall. Bring him out. Who? Oh, save your games for the casino. Glanert! Just take it out of there and put it on the floor, then kick it over here nice and easy. There are times to be a hero. This is not the one. I want Konstantine in here, now. Get him. And Glanert. Nothing funny, or he dies laughing. I guess you are the altruistic type that can't be bought. You talk too much. -Galina? -Alec? Alec: In here. The gun. What took you so long? All right, let's get out of here. Move him away from that door. Over this way. Behind you! (gunshots) Alec! (gunshots) Move! You just had to raise your voice! Anything but let him in the door. With a gun to my head? I heard when he had a gun at your head you weren't so brave. Don't ever talk to me that way. And don't take out your failures on me! Failure? Whatever you're into, it's obviously coming apart. That's failure, isn't it? Failure means losing, and I'm going to win. Are you sure Franklin didn't say anything? You can lead a man to bed, but that doesn't guarantee he'll talk. I have told you that. What about this morning? Phone calls? Visitors? Nina: A visitor. Anyone interesting? A woman. I think her name was Galina. I overheard something about a missile. What the hell is it all about? Anything else? You may leave now. Toni! I want Franklin and Senyonov, and I want that woman, Galina. And I want Stetson! Walking or laid out, I want him. I want him now. And, Toni. If Nikolaeff is ready, I want to move up the schedule. And if possible, Toni, I want Franklin alive. I want to teach that pig what it means to put his filthy hand on me. Hey, slow it down, slow it down, will you? We don't want the police. What did you get out of Stetson? Plenty. Yeah? Galina? Galina: Yes? Nikolaeff is here. He's working for the Baron. Who's Nikolaeff? Galina: Before he defected, he was our top remote control specialist. Developed our newest guided missile. Galina... ...what's the effective range of that missile? Forget politics. Answer him. A low flying missile. Special attack warhead, first developed by new propelling charge. Maximum operative range, 120 kilometers. Low cruising ability, 70 miles. It was confidential, you know, Comrade Semyonov. Seventy miles. All right, the range might be only 70 miles, but the target has to be the conference at Keesh. And Keesh is only 15 miles from where the Savatz River empties into the Persian Gulf. And Nikolaeff's specialty is? Remote control. Now all we have to do is figure out how. Boat, plane, submarine, what? What? Stetson knows. We've got to find him. Yeah. How'd you find time to manage that? I'm a Russian, remember? We haven't got much time. There are riots, demonstrations, huge religious uprisings. We've gotta move fast. Alec: Well, here we are. (doorbell rings) Yes? Konstantine: The girl who works at the casino, is she here? Woman: No, she is not. She gave me this last night. May I come in? Business? Konstantine: In a manner of speaking. If we are speaking of the same thing, it's business. If not.... We're speaking of money. For what? Konstantine: Information. I must talk to Stetson. I don't know anything. Please. I have to find Stetson. I need your help. Just his address. That's all I want. 1244 Hafez Avenue. Thank you. (footsteps fade away) (car engine revs) Last minute checks. Problems? Not a one. You've done well, Dr. Nikolaeff. You've lived up to your reputation. Thank you, Baron. Eight hours? According to the master board, it should be a few minutes less. I would like to start now. With the missile on deck in broad daylight? (laughs) Of course not, I was thinking aloud. Hmm. Speaking as a scientist, all the newly designed equipment is destroyed when the boat disintegrates. Perhaps you would rather be on it, operating it manually. I also was thinking aloud. I must commend you, Baron. Your plan is brilliant. The missile hits, explode the boat, no evidence. Nothing but retaliation on both sides. Truly brilliant. We load a few minutes before dark. That puts the impact schedule back from seven to four in the morning! The three hours do not matter. The assumption is the same, an attack on the conference. I have to go over that. Things are getting close. Nikolaeff: Expecting trouble, Baron? Doesn't matter. Nothing can stop us. We can't lose. Think of it, Doctor. The enormity of what we are going to accomplish. I understand Mr. Stetson has disappeared. Not for long. Unless he's stopped breathing. Konstantine, watch out! (gunfire) Galina, out of the car. (gunfire) George: Toni, Ringo, get in the car. I'll cover you. (sirens blare) That's it. The department will never believe this. Alec Franklin in an Iranian jail with two Russian agents and a felony charge. I would think between the Russian Embassy and the America Embassy, we should be out of here by now. I don't think my home office is going to be very happy with me. I didn't even check in with my ambassador. And if we're not out of here soon, Alec, -I wouldn't worry about it. -Yeah. (door unlocking) Captain. I like your rooms at the hotel better. The rates here are far less. (laughs) This way, please. Would you believe this? Did it ever occur to either of you to come to us for help? You are registered at your embassies with our government. There are certain matters I cannot discuss-- You are looking for Stetson. And you, Atwood's death, why didn't you come to us? Because they told me you said he died in a robbery. Do you have information contrary to that? I'm certain that the Baron was behind it. The Baron? Yes. Can you prove it? Alec: No. We think we can. Do you know where Stetson is? We are completely familiar with his habits. His women, and the places that he frequents. We think the Baron killed Atwood, and Stetson knows about it. Will you get us out of here and help us find him? I'm sorry, but this is a matter for our State Department. Please, it's a matter of great urgency. Any contact with the State Department would only delay us. And any delay could be fatal. What we're talking about is the possibility of an international confrontation. Please. You must believe us. For your two countries to be working together, I must believe you. I think I know where we can find Mr. Stetson. ♪ (Middle Eastern music plays) Stetson? (speaking Farsi) What's the matter, you don't want to make love? I've got big trouble, baby. By now, everybody's looking for me. The police, the Baron, the CIA. Even Russian Intelligence. Well, they won't look for you here. Don't count on that. As soon as it gets dark, I've gotta clear out. That means goodbye, baby. In my country there is a custom. If a man must go away, his woman dances for him. And then they make much love. It's a nice custom. If you had thought about it, you'd realize that we Iranians are just as interested in what's going on as you are. Our country is in the middle of the mid-east powder keg. Unfortunately, up till now, we didn't know what was going on. And the Ayatollah's about to light the fuse any minute if we don't stop Stetson and the Baron. Konstantine: Would you mind telling us where we're going? Lately, Stetson has been seeing a lot of a local village girl. For somebody on the run, her house is a perfect place to hide. ♪ (Middle Eastern music plays) (boat engine approaches) Stetson: Get moving, or I'll blow your head off. It's Stetson. He's making a run for it! Stetson: Faster! Faster! (gunshots) Alec: Give me your hand. Let's spread out. I don't care about the others. We've got to get Stetson before they do, and shut his mouth for good. I'll take my men and head that way, and try to get behind them. Remember, Stetson is no good to us dead. Oh, I understand. (speaks Farsi) All right, we'd better split up too, Rosetti can't cover us all. Galina. (cows mooing) I'll go on this way, you try over there. (gunshots) Come on. (gunshot) (cows mooing) (gunshots) Wait here. Hold it. Move. Come on. Come on. Move. (gasps) (door creaks) This way. (dog barking) (gunshots) Stay here. (gasping) Stetson. (struggling) You're the American. Ringo always was partial to that.... We'll get you to a doctor, you're going to be all right. Yeah, for a funeral. We need your help. We have to find Nikolaeff and the missile. All right, Stetson, you're dying and you know it. Now, you don't owe the Baron anything. Listen. And there isn't any time for questions. Okay. An Iranian vessel has entered the launch area, professor. Professor: That ship's within 40 miles. Turn right. Turning right. Activate the firing antenna. Antenna operating. Excellent. Tide's holding. We'll be in position on schedule. Target pickup, then the final countdown. (machinery) Everything's on schedule. It's going exactly as planned, it's only a matter of minutes. You seem troubled. I didn't know what you were into, until.... Rex, when the retaliation starts, what about all those people? Nina, the world never changes. The strong survive and the weak... ...does anyone really care? Wait here. We are close! (gunfire) Baron, what's going on? No need to worry. They'll never get through the bullet proof glass. (gunfire) (screams) (gunfire) (screams) Professor: Start final check. Man: Final check complete, professor. Professor: Missile on target. Ready to fire. (door opens) Baron: Toni. Get her. -Alec? -(gunshot) Baron: Fire! Alec: Hold it! Get away from there. Fire! (gunshot) Galina? Take care of it. Get her. Alec: Hold it! I wouldn't. You're bluffing. Try me. (gasps) (gunshots) Galina. Now move away from there. (beeping) Alec, it's on automatic. All I can do is explode it! How much time? (beeping intensifies) Ten seconds. Explode it. Something has been puzzling me. Those last few minutes, would you have shot the Baron? Galina, now that you're one of us, I've got to tell you. A pro would never ask a question like that. You know, something's been puzzling me, Galina. How certain were you that you were pushing the right button? Mr. Franklin. A pro would never ask a question like that. (laughing) Konstantine: Where to now, Alec? Ah, recalled to Washington. Seems a certain ambassador in Teheran doesn't like his legal attachés taking delays en route. But you know what? I'm going to take one anyway. I'll see you.
