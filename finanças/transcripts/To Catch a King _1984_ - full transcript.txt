[escalating orchestral music] - I, Edward VIII of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the seas do hereby declare my revocable determination to renounce the throne. But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love. [horn fanfare] [daunting symphonic music] [dramatic symphonic music] [melodious music] [melodious music continues] [music escalates] [fast-paced string melody] [birds chirping] [music fades, gravel crunching] - The Duke is expecting me. I am the British Ambassador. [gate squeaking] [tense music] [birds chirping, water trickling] [chirping continues] - Sir Walford Selby, Your Royal Highness. - Ah, Selby. [Selby]: Your Royal Highness. - I won't be a moment. Fraser? Give those to Her Royal Highness, would you? Now, Selby. What is the news from home? - The government want you and the Duchess to come back home as soon as possible. Two flying boats are in Lisbon Harbour now at your disposal. - What about my brother? How does he feel about us coming home? [shutter clicking] - The King has been consulted, yes. - Tell me Selby, if we do come home, will my brother give the Duchess and myself a private audience? [shutter clicking] God knows we only need quarter of an hour. [shutter clicking, shrill chirping] [shutter clicking] [shutter clicking] - Hello. - Hello. - Ah, you must be English. The world is falling apart and you English continue to chase the Trogonoptera brookiana butterfly. - You collect as well, then? - Oh, no longer. One must have the time. A beautiful view from here. [shrill chirping] [grunts with effort] - I'm sure, sir, that the Prime Minister will find you an appropriate person. - I wish I had your confidence after the way I've been treated since I left home. No proper war job, and my wife not even allowed the courtesy of being called "Her Royal Highness". - The Queen does not feel that her... uh... Highness can be received as a member of the Royal Family at this time. - It's unfortunate, isn't it? That the Queen, my brother's wife, has forgotten that the only reason she is queen is because I chose not to be king. [grunting] - Ah! Ah! Ah! [struggling grunts] [choking sounds] Uh! [unsteady breathing] [coughs] [water trickling] - Tell Churchill... I shall return to England on two conditions. One, that I be assured a proper part in the war effort that goes with my station and my experience. [leaves rustling] And two, that my wife be accorded a quality of rank with the wives of my brothers. Now, until these conditions are met, I shall stay here in Portugal and consider my options. - Your options, sir? - Yes, Selby. My options. [dog barking] [barking] - Oh, I'm... I'm sorry I'm interrupting. - Not at all Your... Uh... Highness, I was about to leave. Sir, I will transmit your wishes to His Majesty's government. - Will you stay for lunch? - No thank you, Your... Uh... If you will excuse me, sir? - Of course, Selby. Goodbye. - Your Royal Highness. - Such lovely flowers, David. - Well I'm glad you like them, darling. - Oh, I do feel sorry for poor Selby the way he struggles with my title. "Your, uh... U-uh-ur Highness." I must be the only -ur Highness in English history. [chuckles]: Well... - Darling, as an American, all this fuss over titles seems very foolish to me. But the way I'm adressed as your wife reflects directly upon you. And we mustn't permit any disrespect to be shown. - Yes, I made that quite clear to Selby. We'll return only under my condition, and I did mention options. [melodious strumming] [singing in foreign language] - Good evening, Your Excellency. Everything satisfactory? - Very nice. Thank you. - Are you enjoying the food and the wine? And the singing I hope. - Oh yes. - Good. - Good evening, Colonel. - Good evening, Vedras. I want to see your boss. - He is occupied. But... - Tell him. - I'll tell him you're here. Would you like a drink? - Thank you. - You're welcome. [snapping] [singing in foreign language] [woman]: It's Etruscan. An original. [man]: La Ragazza di Palestrina. [woman]: Exactly. - It's Colonel da Cunha. - Da Cunha? - He wishes to speak with you. - All right. And send the Duke of Alba a bottle of champagne with my compliments. It's his birthday. - Bye, Joe. - It's worth 25-30 thousand. But I'll take much less. Just enough to buy a visa. My sister's in Chicago. I have nothing else. - Go see this man. He'll buy it. He'll try to cheat you. But tell him I said that if he doesn't give you a good price, I'll never give him a table in here again. - Thank you, Joe. You're a saint. - And wrap up in Chicago, Baroness. The wind really whips up off that lake. - Good evening, Baroness. - Good evening. Good night, Joe. - Good night, Baroness. [music fades] [clapping] Give the Colonel a cognac. - These refugees, so sad. So many lives destroyed. Know him? Butterfly collector. - This town is filled with butterfly collectors. Making my business not to notice who's collecting what butterflies and for whom. - This collector was killed in Estoril, just above the house of Ricardo Santo e Silva. Do you know who is in residence there? The Duke and Duchess of Windsor. - Well they haven't been in here yet. - There are rumours circulating. Although it sounds fantastic, the Duke and Duchess are impressed by the story of an attack against them by British intelligence. Also that the Duke is about to go in with the Germans and make an attempt to regain the throne. - I never listen to rumours. - Hmm. Very wise. [laughing] - I hope it's good news, Your Highness. - Thank you. - Such a wonderful place you've created, Joe. It's a tribute to your taste. It would be a shame to lose it. Hmm. Now, as to these pictures... - I'm sorry, Da Cunha. - Just routine, Joe. Just making my course. Thanks for your time. [background chatter] - Trouble, Joe? - "Just routine". That's how they bury you. Routine. [upbeat horn music] - Here is the Duke with the British Ambassador to Portugal, Selby. According to our photo interpreters, the Duke is quite angry. - How did we get these? - The British Secret Service are interested in the Duke until he meets. They were confiscated from a British agent, subsequently neutralized by our people. Anything else? - There's the film you ordered, herr Grutenfuhrer. - Well, let's see it. These were taken during the visit of the Duke and Duchess to Germany three years ago. Didn't you meet them? - No, I was in charge of their luggage. I can proudly say that not one of their 37 pieces went astray. [chuckling] - That's the end, herr Grutenfuhrer. - Very well, you may go. - So, what's the point of this show, Reinhard? - Von Ribbentrop is convinced the Duke can be of great value to us. He proposes that the Duke be brought to Germany now either willingly, or as a prisoner. - Why would he come willingly? - The Duke was a friend of Germany's before the war. And at the moment, he's furious with the treatment he's receiving from the British government. So, while he's in this mood, we invite him here to make a few broadcasts from Berlin which will help shorten the war, and after our victory, be restored to the British throne. - With the dog Duchess at his side as queen. - Ah, he's madly in love with the woman. - I think Von Ribbentrop is drinking too much of the champagne he used to sell. - Himmler is considering the proposal very seriously. If he approves it, I will order you to undertake the mission. - I am to go to Lisbon with his offer? - Exactly. - And if the Duke laughs in my face? - You will escort him and the Duchess across the border into Spain. From Spain, we will have no trouble in bringing him to Berlin. - Kidnap the Duke? - Having an ex-king of England to play with might create some interesting opportunities. [sighing] - Are you interested in my opinion of this little plan? - No. Just draw up a method of procedure should Himmler decide to approve it. - Very well. Reinhard, I may appear at times sardonic, sarcastic, negative. But you know me well enough to be sure that I would give my life for the Third Reich. - If I didn't believe that, Walter, you'd be dead by now.

[chuckles] Come in, it's all right. - I didn't know. - Hannah, I would like you to meet Irene Neumann. Irene, this is my niece from America. Very talented singer. - Oh, very happy to meet you. - Well, same here. I'm sorry I rushed in like that. I'll come back in a while. - It's all right, you can say anything in front of Irene. - Well, actually I just wanted some advice about that General what's his name. - Schellenberg. - Yeah, yeah, Schellenberg. Well he sent me flowers again. I mean they're great flowers but this time there's a note, "Would you do me the honour of joining me for some champagne?" I mean this is three nights in a row. Do I keep ignoring him or what? - Schellenberg comes here? - Hannah, uh... Walter Schellenberg is not just a general, he's a top man in the intelligence. He's a very powerful man in the Third Reich. - Oh, well in that case maybe I should have a drink with him and, I mean, thank him for the flowers. Just for the good of the club, of course. - If you find him attractive there's no harm. - Max! - Better than ignoring him. - Well, just for a minute. I mean I'll thank him for the flowers and that'll be it. - Yeah, good, good. - Okay. See you later then. Oh very nice to meet you, Miss Neumann. - Oh, same here. - Huh. - Such irony, Schellenberg and your niece. - Yes. - We must find another place then. If Schellenberg sees me... - Of course, of course, of course. [rhythmic strumming] [lively jazz music] [applause] [indistinct chattering] - Miss Winter, how kind of you. - General Schellenberg. I just wanted to thank you personally for the very beautiful flowers that you sent me. - My pleasure. Would you do me the honour of joining me? [sighs]: Well, I guess so. Just for a minute, I suppose. - Thank you. You'll have some champagne? - Uh... Yes. [snaps]: Glass. [faint jazz music] [cars passing by] [tense music] [lively jazz music continues] [chuckles] Miss Winter, I must tell you, when you sing, you remind me very much of the great Billie Holiday. - Really. I remind you of Billie Holiday? Have you ever seen Billie Holiday, General? - No but I've got every one of her records. - Oh. I see. [sighs] So you really like jazz and blues, huh? Well... You're some funny kinda general, aren't you? [chuckles] You really are a general, aren't you? - In American terms, yes. - So General, there's a war going on. Why aren't you at the front? - Not all important battles are waged at the front, Miss Winter. [applause] [engine humming] - Yeah well everybody asks me about the name Hannah because it's so old-fashioned. The thing is, when I was born I was really ugly and when they showed me to my father, he said, "Holy Hannah, is she ugly!" And so, I became Hannah. - I don't believe you were an ugly baby. - Well, it's true. - They tell me I was a very beautiful baby. [sighs]: Well I certainly can believe that. - It's been a charming evening, Miss Winter. - Yes it has. Thank you very much for the flowers, all of them. And thanks for the lift. [romantic music] - Perhaps you'd offer me a drink? - Oh, you mean come up? Uh... No, I don't think so. Not tonight. - May I see you again? - Well I'm only gonna be in Berlin for three more days and... But I'll be at the club every night. So until then, good night. - Good night, Miss Winter. [ringing] Schellenberg. [typewriter clicking] Yes, Reichsfuührer. Of course. Right away, I'm going to Reichsfuührer Himmler's office. Make five copies of this report. [rumbling music] Usual distribution. - Very well, General. - I won't be long. [casual horn music] [faint ringing] - Good morning, Frau Neumann. - Good morning, Frau Gouba. - I need this right away, five copies. - I'll put it in the machine immediately. - Rushy rush the whole day. [music intensifies] - Why don't you go and have a cigarette? And come back in ten minutes. - Good idea. I will. [intense string music] [Himmler]: Where are the pessimists now? No one admits to a single doubt about our victory. - Well I certainly wasn't one of them, Reichsfuührer. - There are some names I could mention. And I will at the proper time. Ah, Schellenberg. Finally. - Sorry to keep you waiting, Reichsfuührer. - Heydrich has informed you of the details of the Windsor Project? - Yes, Reichsfuührer. And I have taken the liberty of preparing memorandum containing my thoughts on the matter. - Save me some time, Schellenberg. Summarize your thoughts. - Secrecy, of course, is vital. - Naturally. - I would like to be given written authority to carry on this negotiation. - You will be, signed by the Fuührer himself. - The Duke must be convinced that he is acting in the best interest of the British. He's after all not a traitor. - Of course. And that's why you've been chosen to speak to him. You have a reputation for brilliance, and your social background, well, he will be at ease with you. - You have drawn up a plan for the kidnapping should persuasion fail? - It would have to be improvised according to opportunities. - I leave those details to you. You understand how important it is that the Duke and Duchess be brought to Berlin? It could bring us a very quick victory. - I understand, Reichsfuührer. - Should someone be assigned to assist him in this matter? Especially in case the kidnapping is to be undertaken? - I have thought of that. A member of the Gestapo, a man who knows Lisbon, will accompany you. - Thank you, Reichsfuührer. - Good. You will proceed to Lisbon by train from Paris as soon as all the arrangements can be made. - Very well, Reichsfuührer. [symphonic music] [quacking] - Boy, this stuff is really bad. - You think so? It's supposed to inspire our youth. - Oh really? Well it inspires me to puke. I mean, it's mostly propaganda isn't it? - Isn't that always propaganda? In one form or another. - Well that, General, is one of those... [tense music] ...seemingly profound yet basically stupid statements of... [chuckles] - What about Goya? - What about the Mona Lisa? - Good god, we are arguing about art. - Well, it's worth arguing about, isn't it? - I agree completely. But it's a subject I don't discuss much anymore. - Oh. Well General, you brought me here to see these sculptures, you must've had something in mind? - I'm trying to impress you. - Oh, well... Keep trying. [chuckling] [tense music] [huffs] [tense music continues] - Excuse me, do you have the time? - No. I don't have a watch. - Huh? Crazy woman! [music climaxes] - I was a very good football player. - Really? How much do you weigh? - Why? - Never mind why, how much do you weigh? - 75 kilos? - No, I mean in pounds. - Oh, let me see... About 170. - Oh, that's too small. - Too small? - Yeah. - Oh, you're thinking about American football. I am talking about what you call "soccer". I wanted to become professional but I couldn't because of my military career. - Oh. Well, it's okay. You know, there's nothing sadder than an old athlete, they say. - Ah, I would have liked you to have seen me play. - Oh, I'm sure you were a sight to behold. Well, I really should be going you know, I have a show to do. - Can I take you somewhere? - No, no, I'll take a cab. - Please allow me to do so. - No it's all right, I'll get a cab. It's okay I... I like you very much. Don't worry. [children yelling, birds chirping] [engine revving] [mysterious music] Fritz? Where is everybody? Hey, Arti? [suspenseful music] Anybody around? Oh, where is everyb-- - I tried to find you! - Max, what's going on? - You must get the first train out of Berlin to Hamburg to Paris to anywhere, and then you must go home! - Now Max, calm down and tell me what the hell is going on here. - It's nothing to do with you. - Max, I'm not leaving until you tell me what's going on. Huh? - Hannah, it's no surprise to you that I hate the Nazis, everything they stand for. So I... I began to help one person here, couple there. Jews, liberals, whatever. And I helped them get out with false documents and underground transportation. I knew it was just... just a question of time, but... [fire crackling] Two hours ago... Irene Neumann was... arrested by the Gestapo. - Oh... - She worked at the chancellery. But today, she finds a plan to kidnap the Duke of Windsor and bring him to Berlin. [sighs] If this succeeds, it changes the course of the whole war. And it will be carried out in Lisbon by your friend, Schellenberg. - Schellenberg. - He leaves for Lisbon tomorrow. And here, I have a copy of the plan and no way to warn the Duke. There's a courier coming later tonight but... Well perhaps she'll get here before the Gestapo does. - I could tell him about the plan myself. - Of course there is the passport the... courier was to use. - Why don't I use that one? - If you get into trouble, you throw away the false passport, you hear me? You show your American passport and you go straight back to USA. - Yes, I promise. - And this must be seen by the Duke himself. So how you're gonna do that in Lisbon, I do not know. - I'll figure something out. - Well, I know someone in Lisbon who might help you. He's an old friend from the Spanish Civil War. Joe Jackson, Joe Jackson. - Okay. - He's American. He... He owns a restaurant in Lisbon called O Fado, O Fado. - Joe Jackson, O Fado. How do I get to Lisbon? - I made arrangements for the courier to go to Ludwig Strasse 79. The Durrer brothers, they take you to Paris by truck. The courier was to make her own arrangements to get to Lisbon from there. - Okay. [paper tearing] Durrer brothers to Paris, and then I take the train to Lisbon? Don't worry, if I get scared I'll just run home. I mean, I'll tear up these pieces of paper and I'll flash my American passport and I'll just zip back to Milwaukee, okay? Look, I'm not gonna give my life to this. [sighs] I'm gonna get this paper to the Duke. I promise you that, Max. [tires screeching] - They're here. Come on, come on. Out through the cellar, up into Krumme Strasse. Go. - Max. Max, I love you. - Oh. - Oh. - Go, go, go, go, go. - Max Winter? - Yes? - Come. - No. I'm sorry. [gunshots] [eerie music] [gasps] - Get her. [intense music] [Hannah screams] [struggling grunts] [gunshot] [discordant music] [intense music resumes] [breathes heavily] - Oh! [music intensifies] [panting] [ringing] [loud banging] [knocking, ringing] [panting] - Yes? - Max Winter sent me. He said that you'd take me to Paris. - Ah, sorry. I don't know any Max Winter. - I'm Rose La Noire. - Oh, you are? - Yes. - You have some identification? - Yes. - Huh. You have changed quite a bit since this picture was taken. - Yes I have. - Oh, the hair, nose, eyes. Everything. - Yes I have. There's no question about that. - She must be a right. No Gestapo agent would be so stupid. Come on. [whirring] - Put your own picture in there. The next person who looks at your passport may not be so friendly. - Okay. Thank you. - Come along. - Well what, uh... - In you go - Uh... You mean inside the, uh... - It's quite comfortable. Very well padded. [sighs]: All the way to Paris, huh? How do I breathe? - There's a crack in the lid. We have done it often. Come on, it's late already. [loud whirring] - You'll keep me informed, of course. - Of course. - There's very good communication through the German Embassy. - You will know my every move. - If I don't, Himmler will. - General Schellenberg. - Yes. - I'm agent Kleiber. I've been assigned by Reichsfuührer Himmler to assist you in your mission. - Very kind of the Reichsfuührer. - You know Lisbon, General? - Before the war, Major. - I've been there very recently. I hope I can be of great assistance to you. - Why don't you get on board, Major? I'll join you in a moment. - Very good, General. - A Doberman. They always look like Dobermans. - Be a little careful, Walter. What you say, what you do. There may come a time when even I cannot be of help to you. - But I don't have to eat with the Doberman in Paris, do I? - There's something you should know. A possible problem concerning your friend, the singer. - I have a friend who sings? [chuckles]: There are no secrets between us, Walter. I'm talking about Hannah Winter. Something unpleasant happened last night. Her uncle was killed trying to escape from the Gestapo. - Max Winter? Why did the Gestapo want Max Winter? - A copy of your report concerning the Windsor matter was stolen from the chancellery by a woman employee. She was picked up by the Gestapo and confessed she gave it to Max Winter. He was a contact point for the Underground. The niece... Are you interested in what happened to the niece? - Yes. - She was with the uncle when the Gestapo arrived. But she escaped, killing a Gestapo man in the process. All quite bizarre, isn't it? [propellers whirring] The most bizarre part is the copy of the Windsor report has disappeared with her. - Miss Winter is an American with an American passport. - She killed a Gestapo agent, and she apparently has a secret document in her possession. Oh, come now, Walter. We're not going into mourning over a little piece from the States, are we? - Bye, Reinhard. - Good luck, Walter. [engine revving] [whirring continues] [symphonic music] [birds chirping] - Open the back. - Oh. Just a dead body, my friend. - Open. Take it out. - You have no respect for the dead? - Take it out. Open it up. - No. - This is desecration. - Open it up. [birds chirping] Wait! - Oh! [suspenseful music] [engine accelerating] [prayer in French] I'm being chased by a German. - Stay close to us as we leave. Continuons à prier maintenant. [prayer continues] [music fades] [rails squealing] [background chattering] [speaking in foreign language] [whistle blowing] [speaking in foreign language] - Passport, please. Hello. [air hissing] [intense music] - Here you are at last. You made the train. I was afraid you'd miss it. - Excuse me, sir. We have some questions for this lady. - I am General Schellenberg, Special envoy of the Fuührer. This lady is my guest. - But General, she fits the description-- - It must be a mistake. Is there anything further? - No, sir. Have a nice trip, General. - What a pleasant surprise. Where's your luggage? Already on board? - Uh... - Good. Major Kleiber, would you get something for my friend and me to eat? And after that, find yourself another compartment. And a bottle of champagne. There must be champagne on the train. Please. Make yourself comfortable. Sit down. - Thank you. - I'm sure it was a misunderstanding. - Yes, uh... - With this war. There are so many misunderstandings. So, where are you going? Madrid? - Lisbon. - Lisbon? I too. Singing there, are you? - Yes, I'm singing. [faint whistle blowing] How about you? - Not singing. [whistle blowing] [loud chugging] [accelerated chugging] I feel like a glutton eating alone like this. - I'm not hungry. - Hannah, I'm sorry about your uncle. You know, when Mozart's friend Barisani died... - Please don't tell me a Mozart story. - You don't like Mozart? - I'm crazy about Mozart. [sighs] It's just that every German when he wants to show how refined he is, he tells a Mozart story. Okay, go on. - When Mozart's friend and physician Barisani died, Mozart wrote in his diary, "Today I was so unfortunate to lose by death a noble man. He's at rest. But I shall never be at rest again until I have the felicity of seeing him again in a better world, and nevermore to part." [solemn string music] - Mozart's friend, Barisani, he wasn't shot down in cold blood by a bunch of thugs, was he? - I once told you that not all battles are fought at the front. [sniffles] - This man that I shot. Did he die? - Yes. - Worst thing I ever did before in my whole life was to kick the back-up singer in the shins in Detroit. - We're all capable. - Of anything. - To survive. - I don't believe that. What's your excuse? Don't blame it on anybody else. My Uncle Max could have survived. Just kept his mouth shut. [chuckles] Book Dixieland. - Let's not fight over politics. - We're not fighting. - Excuse me. I'll make sure that we're not disturbed tonight by the border inspectors, if you'll give me your passport. Any passport. Doesn't matter, I'll see to it. [gentle strumming music] [indistinct chattering] Quite comfortable, Kleiber? Cognac. - That woman, she's the one wanted by the Gestapo. - Brilliant. - Why didn't you allow her to be arrested? - Isn't it better to know whom she meets in Lisbon? Know the enemy, Kleiber. - It's very risky. She has the stolen document. - And we shall make sure that it is never seen by His Royal Highness. Won't we, Kleiber? - I for one will do my duty. [indistinct chattering] [rapid chugging] [train whistle sounding] - How did I get here? - You were talking. Suddenly you fell over and went to sleep. - Well why didn't you wake me up? - I'm a gentleman. Also I enjoyed it. - Well. Well did I talk? Or snore? Or anything? - No, you were so quiet I was afraid you were dead. [sighs] - Where are we? - Approaching Lisbon. Hannah... Last night when I said I was sorry about your uncle, I'm even more sorry because it hurt someone about whom I care. - Yes, I understood that. I think I'll go freshen up. I'll be right back. I'll see you back here. [mysterious music] [clacking] [indistinct chattering] [clacking] [speaking in foreign language] Excuse me. Sorry. Oh! So sorry. May I get through? Please, please. - Out of the way. Out of the way! [yelling in foreign language] - Go after her. Bring her back. [shrill whistle sounding] [whistle blowing] [train chugging] [lively music] [indistinct chattering] [engines revving] [lively music continues] - Hey, excuse me. Do you know where's O Fado Club? - It's to the top... - Okay. [indistinct chattering] [panting] [loud chattering] [children laughing] [panting] [music intensifies] [indistinct chattering] Ah, I'm looking for a Joe Jackson. - I'm sorry, he's busy. - I gotta talk to him, I'm an American. Oh, is he here? Hey! Are you Joe Jackson?! [panting] I gotta talk to you. I'm an American. Please? Is that him? - Yes, ma'am. - Hey. My uncle, uh, Max Winter? He said you could help me out. I'm an American. There's a Gestapo chasing me, this is the guy. Can you help me? - You. You come with me. - Stay where you are. - She's a criminal. She must come with me. - Isn't that really up to the lady? [gasps]: No! Please help me. - I suggest you leave. Wait a minute. Keep your hands off. Now just leave. Quietly. - I'll be back. [indistinct chattering] - Vedras, will you see that we're not disturbed while I take Miss, um... - Hannah. [voice breaking]: Hannah Winter. - ...Miss Winter back for some coffee. - Yeah, uh... Look, I have this document I have to get to the... Duke of Windsor. It's a plan to kidnap him and take him to Germany, and Max said it was very important. [sniffles] - Where's Max now? - They came to pick him up and he was in the Underground so they killed him. [dismal music] - What were you doing in Berlin? [chuckles]: I was singing. I'm a singer and Uncle Max asked me to come and sing in his club and I'd never been to Europe before and... [sniffles] I hadn't really ever seen that much of Uncle Max. I mean he came to Milwaukee a couple of times and I always liked him very much. So, when he asked me to... ...to come, I did, even though there was a war on and everything and I didn't have any idea that he was in the Underground. - Max wasn't one to stay out of a fight. [sniffles] - You knew him well. - I knew him well. - Yes... Well... [sniffles] Well, uh... We were booked for four weeks and everything was going just great, you know? I mean the drummer had a beat problem but the place was packed and then two days ago I came in there and Max said that they were gonna come and pick him up and that he had to get some information to the Duke of Windsor in Lisbon. And I didn't have any idea of what he was talking about. [sniffles] He really didn't want me to get involved, you know? But there wasn't any other way. [sniffles] And... And then the police came or the Gestapo or the SS or whoever they are and... And I got away. But... There were some shots and... Max was on the floor dead. [sighs] So you'll help me? - The first thing I'm gonna do is to take you some place where you can get some rest. That's safe. [tense music] - She should have been arrested in Paris. - You should have caught her before she got to this... restaurant. Now this Joe Jackson. What about him? - An American. - Walter. - Ah, Hans. Nice to see you again. - Welcome to Lisbon. - Thank you. Do you know Major Kleiber? - Yes, we've worked together many times. Walter. We all know about your mission. You understand, of course, that the Embassy can't be involved officially. I will be your contact. Provide communication with Berlin, any logistical support you may need. [sweet music] - So you're a singer? - Yeah. - What kind? [sighs]: Jazz, blues. Big bands now and then. Well, once. - Have you ever heard Fado? - Fado? No. What's that? - It's the Portuguese folk music. Melancholy, sad, and it means fate. - Fate. - From the Latin. - Oh. Fate. That's funny. [sweet music continues] - Hello, boys. Good dogs. - Oh. Are those dogs okay? - Oh yes, they won't hurt you. No government in their right mind would go ahead with a thing like this. - Who says they're in their right mind? They're going ahead with it. - How do you know? - Because that document is signed by a General Schellenberg. And that General Schellenberg is here in Lisbon, I came in on the train with him this morning. - You came in with this, uh, Schellenberg? [sighs]: Yes. In his compartment. He helped me out of Paris. [sighs] I mean I was about to be arrested because I think they knew that I had this document. And I... killed a Gestapo man in Berlin. [sighs] It was an accident. I was trying to get away and, he grabbed me in the cellar in the club. Then his gun went off, and it was an accident. Anyway... When I got to Paris, he kept me from being arrested at the train station. I knew him from before. He used to come and hear me sing in my uncle's club. He likes blues. [chuckles] He helped me out. - Does Schellenberg know that you've got that document? - I don't know, I'm not sure. - And he just let you get off the train? - I jumped off the train. - Pretty careless of him. [seagulls squawking] - Look, if you don't believe me, why don't you just tell me where the Duke lives and let it go at that, huh? - And you'll just walk over there with your little piece of paper and say, "Hi, I'm Hannah Winter from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. I'd like to talk to the Duke for a sec, it's about a kidnapping plot." - Yes. Something like that, yes. - The Duke is in Estoril. That's about ten miles down the coast. But his villa is crawling with secret police and agents from both sides. And agents from some sides I've never even heard of. So get the idea out of your head that you're gonna do it alone. - Well I'm gonna do it. Whether I do it by myself or with you, I'm gonna do it. [melancholic music] - And get killed like Max? Look. This isn't our fight. Every 20 years or so, countries get together and kill off their young and wait for a new crop. It's a disease. - Really, is that what you believe? Joe, there's good and bad, there's a difference. - Those are just words. - Well my Uncle Max died for those words. - You wait here. I have to have time to think about that. - You can't think about it. This whole thing's gonna happen today or tomorrow or the next day. - All right. You stay here. - Joe? [casual symphonic music] - Lord Monckton to see His Royal Highness. - O que? - Walter Monckton. 1st Viscount of Haycroft to see by appointment His Royal Highness, the Duke of Windsor. - My dear Walter. How good of you to come. - How are you, sir? - I'm all the better for seeing you. [clanking] Governor of the Bahamas. - Governor of the Bahamas. [water trickling] Now that's it? - I spoke to Churchill yesterday and he advises you to take it. - Virtually sending David and myself into exile. - It's an important post. - Oh, come Walter, I'm not a fool. - Might as well be Siberia. - Siberia isn't British. [whispers]: Of course. - Tell me, Walter, has any member of the Royal Family anytime in history served as Governor of the Bahamas? - No, sir. But I must make this clear to you as an old friend. The conditions that you yourself laid down for your return to England will not be met. - Are my conditions that outrageous? After all, I am a former king. And brother of the present one. - I'm sorry, sir. - Oh, surely there must be a post more suitable than the Bahamas. - An American cargo ship will be in Lisbon on August the first. The Embassy will arrange suitable accommodations. You will be taken to Bermuda and a Canadian ship will accompany you directly to Nassau. [leaves rustling, birds chirping] - Well then. I must go to New York first. Buy some new clothes and... see my family. - Please Walter, make one more effort. I mean, what's wrong with America? We have so many friends there. - If you wish. Certainly. No one wishes to force a decision upon you, sir. - But that's exactly what they're doing, Walter/ It's their way or no way at all. [tense music] - Becker! Becker! [waves crashing] Becker! Come down or I'll set the place on fire. - Who is it? - Be careful with that, Elric. You'll lose some toes. - Schellenberg. [chuckling] What the hell are you doing here? You're a General already. At the age of 39. Quite remarkable. - And you are still alive and working. That's quite remarkable too. Well, my friend, it seems we've won the war. - I'll be driving up to Buckingham Palace any day now. [chuckling] Shall we talk business? - If you insist. - I need a reliable contact inside the Duke of Windsor's villa in Estoril. - That's not so easy. - I can pay highly. [grunts] - Frankly, Schellenberg... I've been thinking of getting out of this line of work for today. - You will do this for me, Elric. You have been useful to the Reich in small matters. We also know that you have been useful to the British. - That's not true! - We allow it to continue because we feed you false information for them. As I suppose they do for us. But should you no longer be useful. - Well. Since you put it that way, my friend. The head of the security police is a Colonel da Cunha. But he's beyond bribes. Probably a little pro-British. However, There is an officer stationed at the Duke's villa. Captain Jose Mota. A man with expensive tastes. And no ideologies. - Jose Mota? Fine. Get him for me, Becker. [malevolent music] [low rumbling, bells clanging] [crickets chirping] - We breed the bulls for courage and for the length of their horns. The small, timid bulls go directly to the slaughterhouse. - Very similar to the human condition. - You're quite near the border here. - Ten miles. Smugglers pass by every day. Would you like to see the feeding pens? - Oh, no, no. I'm afraid we haven't any time, do we David. - No we, um... We must get back to Estoril. [hooves clopping] - I hope you will do me the honour of attending my annual festival next week. We show the new bulls, there's singing, dancing. It's very gay. - It's very kind your invitation but we really don't know where we'll be next week, do we David. - Ah, this war. Every day I pray for peace. - No harder than we do, I assure you. - We've had a lovely day, Senhor de Oliveira. - It has been my honour, Your Royal Highness. Believe me, you and His Royal Highness are deeply loved by my country. - You wish to be escorted directly back to the villa, Your Royal Highness? - Oh, yes please, Captain Mota. And no stops. Drive Tom, back to the house. - Very good, Your Royal Highness. [engine revving] [melodious strumming] [singing in foreign language] - Last week you showed me some pictures of a butterfly collector. What I want to know is, any new collectors in town? [indistinct chattering] - I am flattered, Joe. You never asked for my advice before. Do you know how I keep my job? The secret is not seeing too much. - There is a gentleman at the bar who wishes to speak with you. His name is Schellenberg. - I'll be right back. - And not talking too much. [singing continues] - Mr. Jackson? I am Walter Schellenberg. I understand you've been of some help to Miss Winter. - A man tried to grab her. Apparently, he was your man. - I don't want to see Miss Winter come to any harm. - You have a funny way of showing it. - She has told you why she is in Lisbon? - She's told me why you're in Lisbon. - And now our cards are on the table. - Face up. [applause] - There is no possible way she can talk to the Duke. To help her would be very dangerous. - Dangerous. Is that some kind of a threat? - A statement of fact, Mr. Jackson. From what I've heard, you seem to be a reasonable man. You're an American. This is not your fight. - You're beginning to make it my fight. - Miss Winter is very attractive. Sometimes one is inclined to do things for an attractive woman one might not ordinarily do. - Yeah, Schellenberg. That's a trap we all fall into. - It could be very expensive for you. Place like this? The wrong move and it could disappear. And just for a pretty face? - You know what I'm hearing? I'm hearing a lot of warnings and a lot of threats. I don't like warnings, and I don't like threats. And I don't like you. So you better get outta here before I personally throw you out. - I've made myself clear then. - Get out. - It's all right? [horn sounding] You see that boat, Joe? The US cargo ship Excalibur. It sails for Bermuda in three days. They're tearing out bulkheads to make a royal suite. Accommodation for the Duke and Duchess. - How can I get somebody in to see the Duke? [horn sounding] - In person? - In person. Alone. - I couldn't do it. It would be a violation of trust. I can tell you who might be able to make such an arrangement. - That's good enough for me. [waves crashing] [typewriter clicking] Becker? - Joe Jackson? - I want to see the Duke of Windsor and I've got dollars for you. - American dollars? Fine. Fine. [discordant string music] [peaceful string music] - They're all letting you down, you know. - Oh, darling. Walter is an old friend and I do trust him. - Don't you see? You're completely isolated. They treat you like a stranger with a dreadful disease. [laughs]: It's not as bad as all that. And we do have each other. - I've ruined your life. - No. No, you've given me something very precious. [sighs]: Oh, David. I feel so miserable that we're being shipped off into virtual exile. - Not quite yet. We still have a few days to play a little poco. with the foreign office. [inhales audibly, dogs barking] [waves crashing] - Joe! Oh, boy did I sleep. I tried to stay awake till you got home but the sound of the waves and, clunk. - Your friend Schellenberg came into my place last night. - He did? God, I can't believe it. - Well he did. He said that you and I better stay out of his way, to try to see the Duke would be dangerous. - Oh, what'd you tell him? - Look, how well do you know this man? - I told you. He used to come into the club. He loves jazz, I had a couple of glasses of champagne with him. I went on a date with him once. - You didn't make a point of meeting him? As part of Max's underground activities. - I didn't know anything about that. - And isn't it coincidental that Schellenberg signed the document and he's the one that helped you get to Lisbon. [chuckles]: Joe, I've been thinking, you've really been very great to me, I mean, you've kept me from these people and you gave me a place to stay and you gave me something to eat and you've really been very nice. Now if you just point me the direction of the Duke's house, I'll be happy to go on my way, huh? - Okay. Take it easy. I made arrangements for you to see the Duke. - Joe! [laughing] Oh! Oh... - You'll see the Duke. - Oh. - You'll tell him your story, you'll show him the document, and then you go back to the US, right? - Joe, you're wonderful. When do I see him? - Tonight. [frogs croaking] - Now it's 100 yards from the shore, right? - Right. This is your only shot. There's a gazebo. Do you know what a gazebo is? - Of course I know what a gazebo is. We had a gazebo at our summer place. It was a great gazebo. - Okay. [splashing] - He'll be sitting there, the Duke. He goes there every night at ten to smoke a cigar, right? And no guards around. - That's what I paid for. [church bell ringing] It's time. If you get into any trouble, scream. Can you scream? - I'm a singer, I can scream, of course I can scream. I wish you were coming with me, Joe. - Alone, that's the deal. Do you want to call it off? - Uh-uh. [birds chirping] - Better go. - Okay. - Hannah? Be careful. [gentle warm music] - Your Highness. - Mm? - I'm Hannah Winter, I have to talk to you. [gasps sharply] Oh. - Good evening, Hannah. Strange how we keep meeting each other. [inhales tremulously] Now, if you'll just give me the document which was stolen from my office. Give me the document. Forget about seeing the Duke. Be reasonable. - I don't have any document. I don't know what you're talking about. - Hannah. - What. - I like you very much. We are not enemies. Certainly we have more in common than you and Joe Jackson. - Well you don't understand anything, do you? - Kleiber? [Hannah gasps] - Ugh! - Take Miss Winter back to the Embassy. [tense music] - I'm not finished yet! General! - Hold her until I return. [muffled screams] [voice muffled]: Let me go! Joe! Schellenberg was in the gazebo! - Shh! Come on, keep quiet! - What happened Joe?! - Come on. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch, Becker. I'm gonna kill him! - Scotch is fine, Your Royal Highness. - Still plenty of good whisky in Lisbon. All right, Captain Mota, you can leave us now. - Very good, Your Royal Highness. - Captain Mota, many thanks. - Here you are. Very reliable man, Mota. So Schellenberg, you've... You've just arrived in Lisbon, is that it? Oh. Please, please. - I've come only to see you, sir. To bring you the Fuührer's personal greetings. He was very concerned that in the defeat of France, you and Her Royal Highness might have suffered some hardship. - Well, we... We did have a few difficulties but we managed. - More important, I am here to invite you and Her Royal Highness on behalf of the Fuührer to come to Germany. - Schellenberg, my country is at war with Germany. - The war won't last much longer, sir. We want peace with England. Only the Churchill clique stands in the way of peace. [clock ticking faintly] The Fuührer proposes that you come to Germany now. And when peace is achieved, help establish good relations between our two countries by again assuming the throne. With Her Royal Highness by your side as queen. - I... I... Are you suggesting I betray my country? - Absolutely not. I'm suggesting you can save hundreds of thousands of men both English and German. If the English people could be assured by you, that you and Her Royal Highness would again assume the throne, a just peace could be concluded without invasion. - Well, um... [sighs] I certainly would like to see this bloody war ended. - No more than the Fuührer. You know he has great admiration for the English people. - I must say, I do find all of this a bit startling. - We don't expect an immediate answer. You could come to Germany temporarily. Consider your future there. Without the pressure of your own foreign office. - Do you care to join me in another whisky, Schellenberg? - With pleasure, Your Royal Highness. [malevolent music] - You promised me you'd go home. - If I saw the Duke is what I said. - You said if I helped you, you'd take the next plane. - So how have you helped me?! I got to see Schellenberg again, I didn't need you for that. - Look, I'll handle this from now on. You're out of it. - Oh, leave it all to you right? - Give me the document, you go home, and I'll see that the Duke gets it. - Forget it! I've come this far, I'm not quitting now. - Wait a minute, where are you going? - Anywhere, away from you. [sighs] - Don't you understand? I'm worried about you. - Well, don't worry about me. [romantic music] Why do you worry about me? - Because. I do. [romantic music continues] - That's a sweet little scar. Where'd you get it? - Oh. Good morning. - Got it in the war with Uncle max, right? You don't like to talk about yourself much, do you. You don't trust anybody. You don't trust me. - Yes, I do. - So how'd you get the scar? - I got the scar in the Spanish Civil War. - Why were you fighting in Spain? - I was teaching at Upstate New York. Comparative literature, no big thing. And this friend and I, um... We kind of harvested Some anti-facist groups. This friend was a girl. A woman. We were very much in love. [gentle music] And we felt strongly about what was happening in Spain and decided to take the plunge and save the world for something, I guess. She came to Spain with me. That's where I ran into Max. He was a bigwig with the German free people's battalion. In the last days, we were thrown together. Max and I. We were near Barcelona. In a losing battle. Max was one of the bravest people I've ever known. More than that, he believed. - And what about you, Joe? Did you believe? - The last days, we ran for our lives. Max went north to France and I headed south. And the woman... She was killed. Senseless. So there wasn't much to go home for and I ran into Vedras and we opened a place. Small at first, and then... Built it up. Or something. - I'm so sorry, Joe. - Enough talk. - Yeah. Enough talk. [birds chirping] - Well, at least my regiment have let me have Fletcher back. Now, what are the chances of a stop over in New York? - I'm sorry, sir. The American elections are about to take place and it would be politically embarrassing. - But we have so many friends there. My wife wants to see her family. - Sir, the government wishes you to go directly to Nassau by way of Bermuda. Arrangements have been made for you to leave on August the first. - In two days time? What do they think I am? A wayward child? - Frankly sir, the government is eager for you to leave promptly because of the unhealthy atmosphere here in Lisbon. - Unhealthy atmosphere. Do they think there's a plague or something? - I'm talking about the fact that General Schellenberg is here. You met Schellenberg last night. - Well I... I'm free to entertain who I please. - You have a certain public position to consider. - Well a position that's been given damn little consideration by the present occupant at number 10 Downing Street. - Sir, if you're flirting with the Germans, in order to wring concessions out of our government, it's a dangerous game. - Don't be impertinent, Walter. [leaves rustling] Tell Whitehall that my wife and I will leave Lisbon on the first of August. - Aboard the Excalibur. To Bermuda and then onto Nassau. - I've made my position quite clear. - Perhaps you have, sir. Perhaps you have. [intense music] - All right, Becker. I gave you 1000 American dollars yesterday. And you sold me out. I'm talking to you, Becker. [climactic music] - Somebody beat you to it, Joe. He arranged a meeting for you last night. It didn't work out. - And I would've taken my 1000 dollars back. But killing is not my style. - That's true. Have any idea who did this? - He would've double-crossed his mother for a buck. - Too bad you got involved in all this, Joe. - Where do I go from here, Da Cunha? - Back to running the best restaurant in Lisbon. - That's all you got? - That's all. Joe, there is a fiesta tomorrow at the De Oliveira ranch near the border. A showing of their young bulls. Some distinguished people will be there. But I'm sure you can arrange an invitation. - You know who killed Becker, don't you. - I may be neutral, I am not stupid. - Apparently your conversation with the Duke last night was fruitless. We intercepted a wireless message this morning from the British legation to London. Monckton feels the Duke will leave Lisbon on the first of August for the Bahamas. - I will try and arrange one more conversation with the Duke as soon as possible. - No, no, it's too late for that. I informed Heydrich and Himmler of the Duke's intentions. This is the response. - So... I'll have to kidnap him. - Walter, this is neutral territory. It must be done discretely. - Well Kleiber, any ideas how this kidnapping should be carried out? - I am here to assist you, Herr General, in any action you propose. - Very helpful, Kleiber. Hans, I require two reliable men who cannot be traced back to me, to you, to the legation. One must be an expert sharpshooter. - A sharpshooter? We're not here to assassinate the Duke. - I know why we're here, Kleiber. And you by the way, will have an important part in this plan. Maybe a little painful but you are prepared to undergo a little more pain for the Fuührer, aren't you Kleiber? - Even my life, Herr General? - I hope we won't need that. Hans, You may inform Himmler and Heydrich that within 24 hours I'll have the Duke and Duchess across the border into Spain. In my custody. [festive music] [cheering] - I'm so delighted... Royal Highness. [indistinct chattering] [De Oliveira]: General Schellenberg you know, I think. - Quite a treat, all this, eh General? - Quite a location, Your Royal Highness. Your Royal Highness. - Nice to see you. [applause] [lively Portuguese music] - Tell you one thing if the Duke is there today, nothing's gonna stop me from talking to him. - Well you won't have long to wait. [upbeat marching music] [faint marching music] They're here. - Are you sure? - That's the Duke's car. - Oh. - Is it all right if we leave this here? - Certainly sir, I'll keep an eye on it for you. - Thank you. [suspenseful music] - You're a little late, Joe. This entrance is reserved for the Royal Party. - All right. [pounding drums] [horn melody, rhythmic clapping] [cheering] - There they are. - And Schellenberg too. - I can't believe I'm this close to them and I can't get to them. - He is a very skilled and great horseman. [upbeat festive music] - Excuse me. I seem to be leaking oil. Would you have a look? - What's your car? - The same as yours, a few years older. It's just through there. - Yes all right, then. - Very kind of you. - Oil? [unsettling music] [thud, loud grunt] [thud] [horn fanfare] [audience roars] [festive music resumes] [applause] [indistinct chattering] [cheering] [music fades] [The Duke's voice]: Has any member of the Royal Family at any time in history served as Governor of the Bahamas. [echo] It might as well be Siberia. [echo] It's their way or no way at all. [echo] Governor of the Bahamas [echo]. [music resumes] [cheering] Are my conditions that outrageous? After all, I am a former king. And brother of the present one. [echo] - These are the vulcados. [horn fanfare] - Ho, ho, touro. Touro! Wup! Whoa. Touro! Hey! [audience roars] [The Duke's voice]: Tell Churchill that my wife and I will leave Lisbon on the first of August. [echo] - Finally the bull leaves the ring where the banderillas are removed. But he is now too clever to be allowed to come into the ring again, so he is put out in the fields. [cheering] [music ceases] - Okay, that's it. [accordion folk music] [applause] [suspenseful music] [accordion folk music continues] [indistinct chattering] [suspenseful music] - This lady has to see the Duke. - Hey, I'm a personal friend of the Duchess. Went to school with her in Baltimore. [dark music] [gunshot] [hysteric screams] [Schellenberg]: We must leave, Your Highness. Immediately! Mota, into the car, quickly! [screaming] For the Fuührer, Kleiber. - Yes, General. [intense music] - Drive quickly. You know the way. - What happened? - They switched chauffeurs. They're headed for the border. [engine humming] - David. - Oh, don't-don't be alarmed, my dear, there's nothing to worry about. - I think we're quite safe now, Your Royal Highness. - Thank you, General Schellenberg. [intense music continues] - If they get to the main road, we'll never catch them. - Faster. [engine roaring] Your window. [tense music] - This isn't your driver. - No, no. No this isn't my driver. - Uh! - All right, come on. Who do you work for? - Is there a problem, Mr. Jackson? [birds chirping] - Problem? No. Somebody stages a phony shooting and then substitutes this man for the Duke's chauffeur? - Oh, I'm sure it's all a mistake. - Yeah, yours. He's a phony. - I know, Joe. We'll take care of him. Your Highness, someone knocked out your chauffeur. He's quite all right now. One of my men will drive you back to Lisbon. - What is happening? - Will someone tell me what the hell is going on here. - Your Highness, I think this document will explain everything. It is signed by General Schellenberg. - Thank you. - Well, Mr. Jackson. I'm sure we'll meet again. - Yeah, I think that's going to happen. Just something that has to be done. - Surprising, Hannah. When I met you, I never dreamed you might change the course of history. You know as Mozart said... - General, do yourself the favour. Forget Mozart, huh? [bittersweet music] - Perhaps you would like to ride back to Lisbon with me. - No, I'll go back and consider the condition of my hate. - You're so close to the border here. You might consider leaving Portugal for good. - It has crossed my mind, Colonel. [bittersweet music continues] [hopeful music] [victorious music] - Well we did it. - Yeah, your Uncle Max would have been proud of you. - Well he was a very good judge of people. I mean, he sent me to see you, didn't he? - I've booked you on a plane to leave for the States. - Hey! What do you mean? [dispirited music] - I mean you're going home. - Joe, I'm going to stay. - You can't stay. All hell is gonna break loose soon. The US is going to be in it. And it's better you're not here. - I'm staying, Joe. - No. - A little while longer. - No. - Two more days. - No. - One more day? - No. - One more day. - All right. One more day. - Hmm. [melodious orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music] Subtitling: difuze
