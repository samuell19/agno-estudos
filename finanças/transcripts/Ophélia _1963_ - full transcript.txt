Come, there are limits to what the human mind can bear. Father! A turkey, turkey with chestnuts. And Bellerophon became melancholy. Alone he reached the bank of the Allion... devouring his soul. Fleeing the roads frequented by men. It's always the same. Every boss is the same. - Yeah. Nothing new under the sun. But it's not the same. This one's harsher. For me it's the family. The family Lesurf. They say he drives a hard bargain, like the other one. Yes, but with this one knows we want to strike and he's scared. He tries to protect himself. He's got guards. - Guards? - Armed! A small beer. Good evening, Mr. Ivan! Thank you. A small glass of white wine. I haven't paid. The guy's scared... the mother lies down, and the son's completely... What are you reading? "Kidnapped on her wedding night." It's beautiful! "Kidnapped on her wedding night", it's beautiful. Butterfly. Dragonfly. Grasshopper. It's not a compliment, it's an insult. Tell me the price of my drink. Mr. Ivan, I never know how to take you. I'm strange, aren't I? - Now tell me the price of my beer. - 10 sous. Here's the price of my beer. What's your name? Don't tell me you don't have a name. What's your name? My first name? - Yes. - It's Ginette, Mr. Ivan, you know that. - Ginette. Ginette... Here's a tip for the service. 10 percent. - Ginette! - What? - What did he say to you? - I don't know. - Did he say something crazy? - I don't know. It's not dirty if you don't know what it means! The death of his father, the new marriage... All the same, they keep it in the family! It doesn't surprise me. His head's empty now, he wasn't prepared for this. He's had to grow up, all at once. That's how it is with the Lesurfs: The man's good for nothing. The wife's a beautiful whore, and as for the son... Why such a pure manner, when the messenger deliver the most ignoble words pronounced by Man? Earth is more beautiful than asphalt. Man destroys everything he touches. I must have been born in the wrong century. I should have existed in a time where it was possible to live. Now we've got crows. Filthy beasts! What do these crows want from me? What do they want? Locked. I'm locked out. Even iron slowly rots. Come on, open up! If you yell you'll scare them, and you'll be outside all night. - Who's there? - Me. The password! I tell you I'm Ivan Lesurf. You know me, don't you? You've got to know the password! What does that matter? I'm the master here. I won't say another word. You've got to know the password. If you don't, you can't come in. I refuse, imbecile. And I'll throw you out of here! You'll throw me out? That's good! You didn't hire me, how can you throw me out? Let me in, in the name of God! What's with all this noise? He didn't give the password. Are you completely crazy? Don't you know that's Mr. Ivan? Quick, open this gate! I'm only doing as I was told. allez, laissez ca. - I'll fire him! - Excuse him, Mr. Ivan, he's new. He's replacing Maximilian, who broke his leg. Mr. Lesurf has given us strict orders... And this kid didn't know. But he's a good egg. He's stupid. He's not stupid, but he just got out of the army... For him, discipline is a religion. Orders are orders! We must really be on our toes now. The strike probably won't end soon. Mr. Lesurf fears agitators, he's received death threats. You think he's in danger? Well you know, there's always a risk of dying! Excuse me. Hey, you clowns there! You're not paid to beat up weaklings! You call that work? Come on! When I'm alone with you, my thoughts and memories, your hand in mine, seated at your side I abandon myself to soft pleasures I let the hours pass into oblivion. When in the depth of the forest, I take you by the hand, when your soft sighs alone beguile my ear, I repeat the promises of the night before, I swear to worship only you. When finally content in your sweet rest my trembling knees your only support, And with a gaze as steady as your own like the greedy bee on the leaves of the rose... Adrien, how well you read! I read well because I love you. And because you love me to read to you. It isn't just that. You read well. - Better than... - Yes, better than Gabriel. Good evening, Mama. Good evening, Uncle. Hello, my darling. Did you have a nice walk? I saw some crows. - You seem preoccupied. - No, not at all. They didn't want to open the gate. - They're so loyal they're stupid. - Sparkos says you're afraid. - Not afraid, but taking precautions. - Afraid of what? - Afraid of the workers. - What's happening, Adrian? - Nothing! I'm not afraid of the workers. Only among them there are instigators. It isn't that I'm afraid... but that they want to break me. Don't worry. And with a gaze as steady as your own like the greedy bee on the leaves of the rose often in the depths of my heart penetrates... a sudden terrible wave. You see me tremble, I start I shudder and, troubled, bound suddenly with true happiness. I feel your tears and my soul's amazed. I wrap you suddenly in my affectionate arms... You question me... Are you trying to keep me from reading? No. Why? You could play some other time, couldn't you? I regret this is the hour when I love to play. Ivan, you want to play? Then I leave it to you. Never mind, I'm done. Goodnight, Papa! Goodnight, Aunt. There's a movie tomorrow. Try to get out of guard duty, we'll go together. - What's playing? - I don't remember the title. A weird title, an American film where they fight with swords. You like that, huh? Fights, I love 'em! - Good evening, Lucy. - Good evening, Ivan. What a lovely beast. Bravo, Paul. Give my compliments to Marie. I hope you haven't spat on it? - Monsieur? - Pay no attention, Paul. - Have a big helping. - Please, Ivan... If you don't take more, Marie will be offended. I'll have more later. That's not the same thing. Marie will think you detest her cooking. That's how you antagonize the servants. - That's enough, Ivan! But it's not enough, you have to taste it first. No. - What's the matter? - Don't you want some fish? No, I'm certain Paul spat on it. Ivan, this is intolerable! I agree with you. Paul is well paid, lodged and fed. There's no reason why he should spit on the food. Ivan, this joking has gone far enough. But it's not a joke! Paul spat on the food. Isn't that right, Paul? Isn't that right, Paul? Don't deny it, I saw you. You don't have the right to say such things, Mr. Ivan. I don't hold it against you, Paul, because I know you. You wouldn't have done such a thing if you didn't have a good reason. I suppose that my uncle committed some injustice against you... And has no doubt had spoken to you rudely, reproaching you for some fault of which you weren't guilty. That's so, isn't it? Ivan...this game is intolerable. I command you... I don't take orders from you! Papa. Besides, Paul knows I was only joking. Paul likes me. Isn't that right, Paul? Yes, Mr. Ivan. I know that your fish is as good as it is beautiful, give my compliments to Marie. But I don't want any. I don't want anything. I'm not hungry. I won't permit pranks of this kind! Forgive me. You know what I'm thinking? No, my darling. What are you thinking? I believe I'm not comfortable in my skin. Are you leaving? But the meal is not finished. Excuse me, I have to meet someone. In any case, you'll find it agreeable to be left alone. Eat well, eat a lot, don't get on each other's nerves. Farewell. Where are you going? To Youth. Youth goes to youth as sin goes to sin and as money goes to money. I'm going to meet Lucy. Listen, Claudia... Claudia, my darling. Yes? This can't go on. Ivan is becoming odious, as much with you as with me. - I know. - Well then? I can't much longer endure scenes like this. Did you understand his allusion to money? He thinks he's been robbed. As if he was capable of handling what's happening at the factory. I should have emancipated him. Fortunately you haven't. You know exactly why I haven't. Adrian... Your patience has been wonderful. And you know perfectly well why Ivan is in such a state. He can't bear the death of his father... and our love, our marriage... have shattered him. Of course. Would you like more fish, Madame? - Adrian? - No. No thank you, Paul. You must try to understand. The way he carries on, for the love of God! What's the matter with him? Claudia, Adrian... Good day. Good evening, Andre. What's the matter? My dear Claudia, you can see how upset I am. Don't be so agitated, take a chair and sit down. So, is there a problem? Yes...There's a problem. What's the matter? Certainly it's not serious. It's not what you think, Adrian. The tenants have been dealt with. And that's the norm anyway. No, it's something else. What's happened, Andre? You're so distressed. Distressed? I'm not distressed. I'm afflicted, that's what. Listen... - Could I have a glass of wine? - Of course you can, go ahead. Pardon me, Claudia, but it's about Ivan. Yes, Ivan and Lucy. He's after her. I can see it. He tries to conceal what he's after... Telling her stories. - What is this nonsense? - It isn't nonsense, Claudia! He's got his eye on her! He's always watching her. It scares me. Ivan and Lucy have known each other all their lives. They practically grew up together. I'm not crazy, Claudia. Things have changed. Ivan's never been that interested in Lucy or girls in general... But for some time now... He looks for her. I tell you... They're together right now. She didn't even finish dinner. I tell you, something must be done! I like Ivan a lot. But he's a riddle, all that with Lucy... Since her mother died, she's all I have and I intend to keep her! I've been devoted to this family for 15 years. Understand my anguish... seeing my daughter deflowered by your son. - Come now, Andre. - Deflowered! If you don't put a stop to this, she'll be deflowered! Deflowered. But we'll take care of it. So I'll return to the main point. You're disturbed by Ivan's pursuit of your daughter in general... And that at this particular moment he's with her. - That's it exactly. Very well. On your first point we shall take stock of the situation. As Claudia says, we'll take care of it. And the second point is simple: That you find Ivan and tell him to come back here immediately! Look at how the light pays homage to the shapes of the trees. Look! The sky is part of nature... and completes the landscape with the light and the trees... not with men. Do you understand what I'm saying? Perfectly. A leaf such as this one... summarises all the beauty of nature. Look. Laugh again, Lucy. Laugh again. But I can't. I beg you. Excuse me for interrupting you... but I can have a laugh too. Good evening, Andre. Don't play innocent with me, I saw you, you were touching her! How delightful to meet you! And you let him do such things? You think it's funny, eh? Your uncle demands your presence, if I were you I'd come immediately. - Your duty is done. - Immediately! Your zeal will be appreciated in high places. - One minute! - Leave me alone. Aren't you ashamed? Come on, aren't you ashamed? What did he do to you? What did he do to you? What did he do? He described to me the beauty of nature. Nature? Oh yes! He didn't touch your ass? - No, he smiled at me. - He was touching you, I saw it! I put out my hand and he took it. Understand me, my daughter, you're all I've got! I can't bear him running after you. I don't want to lose you. Slut! Peace go with you. I tell you I understand people. But if he continues to subject us to more and more of his outlandishness... You're exaggerating, my darling. He's the one who exaggerates, my darling. He's odious. Odious! I met her so simply Without ever trying to please All the same I adore myself with such a burning love That there's nothing that could... displease... Say! Fights! There's gonna be fights, look. - It's not disturbing, is it? - No, it's a love story. It's starting. Shakespeare! Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust. Thou knowst 'tis common: All that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity. Aye Madame, it is common. If it be... why seems it so particular with thee? Seems, Madame? Nay, it is. I know not seems. Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother... Nor customary suits of solemn black Nor windy suspiration of foreced breath That can denote me truly. These indeed seem For they are actions that a man might play. But I have that within that passeth show These but the trappings and the suits of woe. Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, to give these mourning duties to your father. But you must know your father lost a father, that father lost, lost his. and the survivor bound in filial obligation to do obsequious sorrow... Lucy! - Come to my room in a little bit. - No. It's imperative, I'll wait for you. Hamlet... "Erneles". ERNELES ELSINORE Caligula! Death! - I snuck in. - Come, let me show you the mirror. - What are you doing? - Making faces. Look. Paris needs a Mass! Henry IV. Louis XVIII. Cleopatra. Napoleon! It all began with the reign of your brother! Agrippina. Louis XIV. Robespierre! Marie Antoinette. Hamlet. Ophelia. By the name LaGrange, I know my daughter! I should know her. I used to be like you, I didn't suspect anything. But she's with him in his room! They're having a rendezvous, it's certain. What's going on up there? Horrible things... Won't you do something? You're being ridiculous, Andre. Ivan is a gentleman. A gentleman! Of course he's a gentleman, I haven't said otherwise. But even a gentleman... has his moments... That's enough, Andre! You're acting like a fool. I order you to be quiet. But Adrian...it's the honor of my daughter at stake. The honor of your daughter is in no danger. Look. It's done. See you later, Ophelia. I'm not Ophelia, Ivan. If you aren't Ophelia, you won't kiss my hand where everyone can see? I'm Lucy. See you later, Ivan. Lucy? Ophelia? To be or not to be! - Hello, Ivan. - Hello, Sporos. You're going in there? The beer is disgusting! I'm not here for the beer. HELP THE STRIKERS Not a word, just money. Ginette! - Hello, Mr. Ivan. - What have you got there? It's a mouse. In its trap. Give me this little beast. Death! Don't you recognise Death? Francois... Come sit down. I was waiting for you. No, leave it with me. Hello, Mr. Ivan. Francois my friend, my brother... Let there be no "Monsieur" between us. Have something. What do you want? A glass of red. Ginette! A glass of red. Two glasses. Francois, you're my only friend. You are my friend, aren't you? Yes. I carry a secret that's stifling me and I can only confide in you. Do you accept? - Yes. I must unburden my heart. Do you know what a murderer is? - Yes. What is it? It's someone who kills. I know a murderer. I think I know two... and that each of them has committed an atrocious crime. Who? My mother and my uncle. - But that's impossible! - Ssh! - It's impossible. - They have. They killed my father and then they married. They killed him so they could get married. That's what I think. I want to unmask them. Do you know about Hamlet? No. He was a prince. His father the king had died. He returned from the kingdom of the dead to tell Hamlet his brother and wife had murdered him in the most cowardly way. You understand? It's exactly the same situation. I have clues and evidence that the same story has repeated itself. I must act as he did: To unmask this criminal couple, I must pretend to be mad. He terrorised them until they confessed. The only means I have to unmask them... is to create the same circumstances that Hamlet did to simulate madness. Some of these circumstances have already shown themselves. You could help me create others. I don't understand any of this. I'm not asking you to understand, only to help. Do you want to help me? Yes. The character I must play is that of Ivan becoming Hamlet. The simple fact of his presence, the fact that I play him, will in itself be a clear accusation. First I must trouble them. First trouble them, and then make them worry. And then they'll be terrified. They must understand they cannot escape punishment. They'll understand the failure of the crime, their defeat. They'll realise justice will catch up with them, and this shall be a horrible nightmare. From which they will try to awake, but they cannot remain awake, for I will stand before them. Listen. This is what I have to do and this is how you'll help me. Are you listening? Yeah, yeah... I'll set a trap for them. In order to unmask his mother and his uncle, Hamlet set a trap. So he could trap them like rats. This will be mine: You and I will make a film. - We'll make a movie? - Yes. But tell no one the reason for it. The subject of the film, in disguised form, will be the murder of my father by my uncle and my mother. When we show the film... the mousetrap will enclose them. Do you want to? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah! - Thank you. - Can Ginette be in it? Very well, but don't tell her the reason. You must not tell her the reason! I promise. Hey, Ginette! The money. - What do you want? - I'm going to make a movie with Ivan. - Do you want to be in it? - A movie? I don't know. We'll be the stars. What are you doing? You've lost it! What are you guys doing? You talk, you walk but you're so soft about it! Act like men, Jesus Christ! Who laughed? Me. What makes you laugh, Matton... with your voice like a virgin's? Nothing, nothing. We're not paid to sit around doing nothing! It could happen at any moment, understand? Lesurf sleeps and we're awake. That's what we're paid for! And he's too scared to sleep with his eyes closed! Monsieur is a rich man... And the rich are afraid of being robbed and killed. That's what politics is all about. So Lesurf's afraid of the strikers? It's all the same. They strike because they need money. And Lesurf doesn't want to give it to them. Because then he'd have less. He's afraid the others will kill him to get his money. And he pays us to prevent it. He'd do better just to give it to them. No, idiot! Because he's afraid that they'd just want more! There's someone in the woods! Come on! Come on! The hunt's on! It's not a fire, after all! Search! Spread out! Cretin! You dumb animal! Trying to get yourself killed? This way! - What's happening? - An alert! There's a man in the woods. What? Ivan! Quick, close the door. What's going on? Why are you wearing that cap? - Didn't you hear the gunfire? - Yes. - Is that all you can say? - It made me turn my head. It's me they're after. They thought I wanted to kill the beloved Adrian. Because of the cap and the scarf. If I'd worn my bowler hat... They wouldn't have worried. You see? People always confuse things with their appearances. Ophelia. Ivan, don't start that again. I know the story of Hamlet. Ophelia was a blonde. I love your blondness...Ophelia. Behind Lucy stands the blonde Ophelia. Ivan, I think I know what you have in mind. - Really? - Yes. And I'm afraid it will make you... I'm afraid you're going crazy. On the contrary... it's everything else that will make me crazy. To endure all this and do nothing... Bravo! You come to have it off in my house now? Not at all! I came on behalf of my uncle, that is on behalf of my father, That is on behalf of Adrian, to invite you to lunch. You and your charming daughter. But I just saw him, he said nothing! Because he left it to me. Then thank you Adrian... I mean Ivan. I accept with pleasure. Then goodbye, dear Andre. Goodbye Lucy. See you soon. - Well? - He vanished like a puff of smoke. Incompetent! Good for nothing! Idiot! Go on, keep looking! What's going on, Smurkos? I heard gunfire. Smarkos, Mr. Ivan. We're hunting a fleeing suspect, always on the lookout. Bravo, Snartos! My uncle will be happy. - Yeah. My precautions were for nothing. Those bastards! What happened? I heard gunfire. A strange man invaded the park. And your uncle's received another threatening letter. Letters have never been that important. The guy hasn't been caught? I don't think so. He got away. Perhaps it was a ghost. I've invited Andre and Lucy on your behalf to have lunch with us. Are you crazy? This isn't the time! What's done is done. Polonius. Could you pass me the salt... Polonius? - Polonius? Don't know him. - Obviously not. You've got other things to do. Eat, for example. One cannot eat before reading the poet's letters. Isn't that right, Papa? Isn't that right, Papa? You're awful. You're stupid. You're old. You're vulgar. That's enough, be quiet! Leave me alone! When I'm assailed on all sides... Then I must speak! But what possesses him? Lucy. Do you know where Mama spent Christmas? In a cabaret. They threw streamers. They put on turbans. They broke plates over each other's heads. And she danced. Christmas. The holiday of God... and of children. It's enough to make you sick. Everything should be forbidden. Under pain of death. Under pain of death! Under pain of being kicked in the ass! This time I think I finally understand. He's a drunkard, a degenerate, completely crazy. You'll never see him again. I say you'll never see him again! You hear me? You understand? - Yes, yes. - I forbid it! - Or else what? Aren't you sleeping? Hey, you! You can't stay here. It's forbidden. I love you, Ophelia. Ivan, I've got something serious to say to you. Say it. I can't see you anymore if things remain as they are. If they remain how? You know very well. You're bitter, cruel, unbearable. You think so? You've been listening to Lagrange. My father has forbidden me to see you anymore. - Obedient little girl. - You know it's not that. An obedient little girl who no longer wants to be my friend. No, I don't want to be your friend! And I don't want to see you either! Not because my father orders me. But for my own reasons. Why? Because you hate people! Lucy! On the contrary, I love them. But I can't bear their turpitude. They ruin everything, they break everything. Evil is hidden in them. It makes their actions vile... it infects their thoughts. I don't know what to tell you, but I'm sure you're wrong. I love you, I love being near you, but you frighten me. I fear for you. You fear for me? My angel! Yes...Even if you're right, you act strangely, and it frightens me. There's something bad in how you behave. No, it's what surrounds me that's bad. It isn't me. Become yourself again, don't evade reality. That's what I'm looking to do. Do as you please. For now leave me alone. Oh, Ophelia... My love. Here I see you descend into your tomb in the first light of day. Here in your madness you are dead, Ophelia... Because I am just. Or, if I am not just, is it because Evil is all around me? I've known those who were gracious and amusing, good and just, but who are now nothing more than dust. How could you not think on it? Hello. Hello, sir. Life is good. - You like this work? - Certainly. You're outside, you breathe the fresh air... and nobody bothers you while you work. And then it's good soil, like butter! - Have you been a gravedigger for long? - This is my first grave. But my father dug graves for 30 years. An excellent gravedigger, well-known around here. With him, never any problems, infiltrations, nothing like that. Never, never. He's the one who taught me. I hope to keep at it. For whom are you preparing this grave? I'm digging without digging, you could say. In short, I'm digging... the lease has expired, so I have to remove the cadaver. And where will you put it? In potter's field. Nobody wanted to pay for another lease. And you can't just leave him! - Would you like to act in a comedy? - What? I'm making a film. Would you like to be in it? Yes, I was in the choir in school. Why? Because I must make a film, and I'd like you to act in it. You have a cheerful air. - I'm not the sad type. I'd love to, as long as it doesn't interfere with my work. - Absolutely not. - Then okay. Sir, you'll have to excuse me, but I have to get back to work. These things don't wait. Go right ahead. Pardon! - You're dead! - No I'm not dead! Don't fight! Don't fight and don't argue. Imagine that Death is standing up there at the turning. Be good... And be good to yourselves. Forget that you're acting. Forget yourselves. Don't gesticulate merely for the pleasure of doing so, but then don't forbid yourselves either. I chose you because I want you to play yourselves. Don't imitate other people. Don't try to make your audience understand. Only make them understand what you're saying. And that you understand the nuances of your characters. Your characters don't exist. Only you do. Understand? Another thing. Be modest: Don't try to get yourself noticed on the screen or elsewhere. There is nothing important about the actor. Acting is honorable. Nothing more. So no plunging necklines or funny get-ups. No laughing out loud... or listening to us talking. Finally, no quarreling over the opening credits, over the size and order of your names. That would be perfectly ridiculous... and perfectly vulgar. - Yes, but... - Silence, not a word. We'll begin. Mama, Uncle... What is it? I'm making a film with young people in the village. It's to surprise you. Would you like to see it? - You made it? - Yes. - That's very good. - Bravo, Ivan. Congratulations. I never thought you were capable of such work. You seem very mysterious these days. - You really want to see it? - Certainly darling, with pleasure. Not only do we want to see it... but we'll organise a party in your honor. And we'll invite all our friends to come see your masterpiece. Plus the servants, Sparkos and his men, everyone will be invited. How wonderful! I didn't realise, I didn't hope for so much. - Are you pleased? - I'm delighted. Kiss me. Is it good? - So, this film... - You'll be seeing it, Madame. - What type of film is it? - That depends on the audience. You could find it funny, or you could find it painful. - But we won't know how to react! - Laugh only if you feel like it. Excuse me. - Is it going well? - Very well, Mr. Ivan. Is it ready? - Ready. - Then let's go. My friends, the show is about to begin. We'll move to the parlor. Ladies and gentlemen... allow me to present the cast of the film. Dear Andre. If you would be so kind as to sit there. Ophelia, I want you to stay near me. When the decisive moment comes, the light will finally break. It's ready! Silence! Put out your cigarettes. The Mousetrap M. Ferlus, grocer, Doted upon by his wife, does the monthly accounts. For some time now, the store hasn't prospered. Madame Ferlus isn't happy. Fred, the brother of M. Ferlus, drops by to say hello. But he has another end in mind. M. Ferlus is stubborn. Madame Ferlus is sensual. And Fred knows how to make the most of it. They must remove the obstruction. Oh, how great is feminine treachery! As great as the treachery of men. So impatience has paid off. Crime has paid! But your story is horrible! Very well, very good. My compliments. I found it a little...twisted! Bravo. Very funny! That really made me laugh. Crime has paid! That's the norm. - I liked the beautiful girl. - It was funny. And what should I do, Mr. Ivan? Nothing. Mama. I know it's late... But what do you think of my cinematic talent? - Go away. - Didn't you like it? You're mad! What you've done is contemptible! How could I have been so blind? You hate everyone! You're a monster! You'll be cast out like a dangerous beast. What you've done to Adrian, my husband... No! Adrian isn't your husband, he's the brother of your husband. You know what that's called? Incest! Did you give your mouth, your body to the other while my father lived? Ivan, I beg you! He killed my father for money and for lust. It was no longer enough to have you in his bed. What is this nightmare? Where do you get these frightful visions? I accuse the two of you of incest and murder! Be quiet, be quiet! Goodnight. Why, my God, why? We are only animals... and our hearts rot before our bodies do. The solution is simple. He's gone crazy! You can't let a madman go free. I don't like speaking like this. But in my opinion, he must be watched. But it's impossible. Have you got another idea? We've got to do something, Claudia! Perhaps at this very moment he's preparing more mischief. Who knows what's going on in his head? His solitary walks worried me. And I was right! Did you talk to him about his charming film? No. - Where is he now? - I don't know. He's certainly going to meet someone. But who? Not my daughter at any rate. She's locked up, well locked up. I promise you she had nothing to do with it. I interrogated her last night about that film. She didn't even know about it, she hadn't seen him for two weeks. - What does that matter? - I defend my honor! Your name is spotless, Andre! Could you do me a favor? - Don't you treat me like a friend anymore? What does does that matter? I'd like you to watch Ivan. What do you say? Could you do this for me? - Gladly! What do you think? Spend all your time on his trail. I'm afraid he'll find out something. And I can no longer live in fear. Go. It's succeeded beyond my wildest hopes. But I'm alone now. I've got no one but you. Dear Horatio. Dear Horatio. The bastard. The bastard! My poor heart. Oh, jays! A nest of jays. Things don't mean the same to you that they do to me. You're brave, kind. You can bear the faults of the world... for you don't see them. But for me, they burn my eyes. Everyone says you've become mean, but for me it's the opposite. Dear Horatio. What's he doing up there? Good Polonius! Are you getting closer to Heaven? Mr. Ivan, I think he's dead. Trees bear strange fruit these days. Rats! Rats in the trees! Go get help. Poor Lucy. Lucy? Look at me. I'm sleeping. Look how I sleep. I sleep, but I can see you. You stroke your hair. You take off your coat. You arrange flowers. You smell a flower. Stop it, you're scaring me! I wanted to scare you. To keep you from crying. Your father is dead. - Paul, have you seen Andre? - No sir. It's the first time in 15 years he's been late. He won't be coming. Why not? - He's at supper. - He's eating supper? I didn't say he was eating supper, but that he was at supper. Not where he eats... but where he is eaten. I don't mean to bother you, but I found M. Lagrange in a tree. - Did you say diamonds? - Stop talking rubbish. It's up to you. Good play. - You're playing for sous? - What do you expect? - You playing? - I am. "All professional categories." "Stop the massacre, that's all that matters!" - Are you having a drink? - Yes. Yes, yes! Leave me, I have to think. Alone won't do. Fine, I'll be upstairs. Forgive me, I have to think things over. More than anything, we need to pray. You can't protect yourself. Why should I have to protect myself? I've done nothing. I've done nothing! No more than the others. And no one's a saint! Why am I hounded? I need to forget. Why do I suffer? Why does he make me suffer? His madness infects me. Claudia abandons me. I can't take it anymore. I'm going to kill him! Sparkos. Sparkos! Monsieur? Sparkos...I want to talk to you. Sparkos, give me your revolver. My revolver? What for? Because I need it. I depend on my revolver, sir. I need it! Lend me your revolver, I'll give it back. That's an order! But why do you need it? Come on! These things aren't for you, sir. Leave it to me! Give it to me. You're making a mistake, M. Lesurf. Thank you. - Not a word. - You know me, sir.. At least I'm paid for it. Understand Elise, with what goes on in this house... we won't be servants much longer, soon we'll be the masters. You've come to kill me, uncle? What's happening? M. Lesurf took poison. He's going to die! Get out. Get out! I don't want you to look at me. Get out! Adrian. - I hate you. - My darling... I hate you. I don't want you to look at me. I feel like I'm abominable. Monster! Don't stay here. Ivan? Come here. Well? You're dying? Yes. I'm dying! Are you happy? Less than I imagined. I wanted to tell you... It should make you laugh: That you be damned. It hurts. You die like a rat. Why like a rat? It hurts. - And as for me... I suffer too. To the point I can't stand it anymore. - Ivan? - What? I can't live for long. How death hurts! - Don't speak. - I have to! I must tell you... that you were wrong. That you've been completely wrong. And that you'll always suffer for it. I only killed myself. I couldn't kill a fly. - And yet... - And yet? I feel like a criminal. Why? Yes, why? You don't know. I feel the same way and I don't understand. Ivan? What? Do you think that Death... is the end of this pain? Of all my pain. I don't know. Do you think that I'll be happy? I don't know. Ivan... My Ivan. My son! Ophelia. What have I done? Why did I want to mete out justice? I judged him, I condemned him. And I killed him. He loved me and I killed him, Ophelia. What have I become? You're what you've always been. You're Ivan, and I'm not Ophelia but Lucy. It's Lucy who is next to you. Lucy. Lucy, my beloved. Support me, protect me, defend me. I'm all alone. I love you. subs by ironhills for KG December 2011
