[Piano Keys Struck Once] [Piano] [Piano Continues] [Strings Join In] [Orchestra Joins In] [Orchestra Continues] [Orchestra Continues] MAN ON RADIO: At the top of the news this morning... Senator Barry Goldwater is campaigning in Colorado today. The Warren Commission, almost a full year after the Kennedy assassination... said that it's close to releasing... - Glenn, it's time. - No, no, just a little more. Come on, if you don't get up right now, I'm gonna cut one of your piano strings. Oh. Oh. What time is it? - Quarter to 7:00. - A quarter to 7:00. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, God. Does the sun really come out this early? It was a surprise to me too. I took a picture of it in case it never happens again. Nobody gets up this early. Oh, yes, they do. Come on, come on, come on. - Please, please, please. - No, no, no. - No, no, no, no, no. This is a stupid idea. - Come on, come on, come on. Oh! Oh, this is definitely not my scene, Iris. It's just a gig. If it doesn't work, you can try something else. - What time am I supposed to be there? - 7:30. 7:30? What kind of people like to go to work at 7:30 in the morning? [Music] # One, two, three # # Oh, that's how elementary # # It's gonna be # # Come on, let's fall in love # - # It's easy # - # It's so easy # # Like takin' candy from a baby # - # A, B, C # - # A, B, C # # Fallin' in love with you was # - # Easy for me # - # Easy for me # # And you can do it too # - # It's easy # - # It's so easy # - # Like takin' candy from a baby # - Hi! - I'm Glenn Holland. I'm the new music teacher. - Vice Principal Wolters. Holy cow. - Corvair. - Yeah. I take it you didn't read Ralph Nader's book. Well, unless Ralph is willing to buy me a new car... I think I'm gonna have to stick with this one until the wheels fall off. Well, you may not have to wait that long. [Chuckles] - Have a nice day. - Thanks. - # It's easy # - # It's so easy # - # Like takin' candy from a baby. # - You look lost, Mr. Holland. - Helen Jacobs, remember? I hired you. - Oh.... Of course you did. I'm sorry. No, no, I'm not... it was not that I'm lost. I was just looking for the... Well, yes, of course I'm lost. What an auspicious beginning. This way. Your first day as a teacher, Mr. Holland. Excited? [Sighs] Nervous. Boy, I never thought I'd be here. No? Why not? Well, like most people, I only got my teaching certificate... so I'd have something to fall back on, - and now I have. - This isn't a drive in, Mr. Claridge. Hands off. You know, Mr. Holland, I don't think of teaching as a "fall-back" position. - No, no, I didn't mean it that way. - I grow nervous around people who do. - I'm... I'm really very happy to be here. Really. - Good. You'll drop by my office later on. I have a list of students you'll be advising. "Advising"? Can I ask when I'm supposed to be doing this advising? That's for you and the student to arrange. - You meet your orchestra when? - Fifth period. - Are they any good? - They try hard, and by the way, I'll need a complete lesson plan from you by Friday. Right. - For September and October. - Right. [Students Chattering] [Sighing] [Door Opens] [Chattering] [Bell Rings] BOY: Let's go sit up in the back. All right, people, come on, let's, uh... Let's take our seats a little quicker, please. A little quicker. We're losing time. Come on in, come on in. Take... My name is Mr. Holland. This, of course, is a title of courtesy. And I will extend back to you... uh, Mister or Miss as the circumstances allow. Uh, welcome to Music Appreciation. This is a class in which we will be studying the... the history of music, um... Who would like to give me a definition of what music is? Any music. What do you think? Music. What do they think that music is in... in general? What do they think? Anybody? Nobody? Okay, let's, uh, let's go to the text. and we turn to page... um, four. and we read that music is... "sound in melodic or harmonic combinations... whether produced by voice or instrument." Now, questions? Anybody... at all? No? Hmm? Good. All righty, uh, now, I just... You know, I just want you all to relax. Have a little fun. You know, we're not here to impress each other. [Chuckles] Okay. All right, let's get ready. Everyone. Come on. You ready? Okay, here we go. [Beethoven: "Fifth Symphony"] [Dissonant] [Dissonant] [Playing Stops] It was good. Miss Aronson, would th... Ma'am... would you stand up, please? Stand up, please. Is that skirt regulation length? - Try on your knees, both of you, - Yes. - right now. On your knees, right now. - I just got this dress. I thought so. Come with me. You're coming to the principal's office. We're calling your parents, and you are going home. You can come back... - when you're dressed properly. - Oh, Mr. Wolters. - But you're not being fair. - I am being fair. If I allow you to do it, everyone is allowed to do it. - Hi. - Hi. Come on. Out of my way. - Teachers don't wait. - Pardon me? High school is not a democracy. Teachers don't wait. Bill Meister, phys. Ed. - Glenn Holland. Music teacher. - Hi. There you go. Oh, my God, what is this? It's Monday. It's turkey Spam surprise. You could mortar walls with it. Word of advice. Always bring a bag lunch. - Where's yours? - I ate it in second period. Sylvie, don't tease me. I need extra. MEISTER: So what have you been doin' for the last ten years? I've been playin' music. Been on the road. You know, um, clubs and weddings and bar mitzvahs. - That sort of thing. - Wait a minute. I bet you met a ton of chicks in those clubs, huh? So you're in these clubs, there are all these women there... why'd you become a teacher? Oh, actually I started teaching because... I was hoping it would give me some free time to do some composing. I'm a composer. That's what I really do. - What? What's so funny? - Oh, the free time. Glenn, I can't remember the last time I had that was free. [Children Chattering] IRIS: I've got it all figured out. With your salary, plus what I take in with the photography... in four years we should have enough for you to quit... and do nothing but compose music... - and become famous and make us rich. - I'll never make it. - I made us $32 today. - Big deal. I made 32 kids sleep with their eyes open. Ow! Right there. Right... yeah. Right there. Yeah. [Sighs, Chuckles] Iris, I think this is gonna be a lot rougher gig than I originally thought. [Sighs] You know, when I was in high school, I wanted to be someplace else, you know. Anyplace. It never occurred to me that my teachers would feel the same way. Well, you can still quit. Naw, we've been through all that. I thought the band was getting pretty good actually. Yeah, yeah, we could play Holiday Inns for the rest of our lives. - Or Los Angeles. - I don't want to be a studio musician. So, it's four years teaching then. Come here. When you were in high school... did you ever wonder if your teachers went home and got it on at night? When I was in high school, my teachers were all priests and nuns. I had such a crush on Mr. Griffith. - He could have taken me home anytime. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - And who was this Mr. Griffith? Oh, he was my music teacher. [Both Laughing] [Woodwinds: Dissonant] [Note Cracks] - Okay, okay, that wasn't bad. - [Playing Stops] That wasn't bad at all. Um, Miss... I'm sorry. - Lang. - Pardon me? - Lang, Gertrude Lang. - Okay, Miss Lang. Um, would you take it from bar 37, please? [Shakily] [Note Cracks] [Students Snickering] - Okay, okay, good. - [Bell Rings] - [Bell Rings Continue] - Good, um... that's enough for today. I'll see you all tomorrow. Very good work. Miss Lang? Would you mind hanging for a moment, please? You seem to be having a little trouble getting through the break. I know. - How long have you been playing? - Three years. Really? Uh... [Chuckles] And do you find that you get all the practice time that you need? I practice constantly. Yeah. [Sighs] Well, then I think... I think maybe... you and I should find some time to work on an individual basis. - That... that would be great. - I... I don't have a lot of time. That's okay. Doesn't matter. Whatever you can give me. That would be wonderful. I just really, really, really want to do good at this. Oh, I bet you do. Um, well, why don't you... come in about a half hour before first period tomorrow and we'll just start? Okay. All r... Thank you, thank you very much. Thanks. [Door Opens] When a flat precedes a note like this... it indicates that the note is to be played a half step lower. A piece based in the F major scale should have a flat sign... at the beginning of every stave. These tests... are pathetic. "Name an American composer." - Miss Swedlin, your answer was? - Bach? - [Student Giggles] - Johann Sebastian Bach. Oh, this... this is my favorite one: "How do you know what key a concerto is in?" Mr. Mims, your answer was: "Look on the front page" question mark. Now, this question mark. Was that because... you weren't sure or because your English skills... are on the same level as your musical theory? These tests are a waste of my time and yours. No kidding. I'd rather be somewhere else. Mr. Sullivan, why don't you pay a visit to Mr. Wolters? Right now! Get your books and get outta here! As for the rest of you, get your textbooks out. We're gonna go over these answers one by one until you get them right. [Bell Rings] BOY: Aaron, wait up. [Chattering, Laughing] [Clarinet] [Note Cracks] Give it up, Miss Lang. [Crying] [Crying Continues] I meant for the day. School's out, Miss Lang. I... I meant give it up for the day. - I... I... I know what you meant. - Then? - Why are you crying? - I'm terrible. I'm... I'm terrible, Mr. Holland. I just practice 'til my lips swell up. - Miss Lang, it takes a lot of work... - I just all I make is noise... I... - to learn a musical instrument. - I just... I just want to be good at something. My sister's got a ballet scholarship to go to Juilliard. And my brother's going to Notre Dame on a football scholarship. My mother's won the blue ribbon for watercolors at the state fair so many times... they've retired the category. My father's got the most beautiful voice. He's... I'm the only one in my family who's... I... I just can't... It... it doesn't make any difference anyway. I... Mr. Holland! Just the man I was looking for. We're forming a textbook committee for next year's curriculum. And I would like to have your ideas and suggestions. - We meet next Tuesday night in the library. - Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Jacobs. - I'm... I'm very busy on Tuesday night. - Uh-huh. You know, for a good four or five months now, I've been watching you, Mr. Holland. I've never seen a teacher sprint for the parking lot after last period... with more speed and enthusiasm than his students. perhaps you should be our track coach. Mrs. Jacobs, I get here on time every morning, don't I? I'm doing my job the best I can. A teacher is two jobs. Fill young minds with knowledge, yes. But more important, give those minds a compass... so that that knowledge doesn't go to waste. Now, I don't know what you're doing with the knowledge, Mr. Holland... but as a compass you're stuck. I really hate that woman. And I hate teaching, Iris. I hate it. Nobody could teach these children. Nobody. I don't know what I'm gonna do. They just sit there staring up at me. There... there's no there there. - I've been trying to teach them... - Listen, you've played a lot of tough houses. When they didn't listen, did you quit and go home? Or... - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - keep playing? Aren't we supposed to be on the same side? I am. It's just that I... I... What? I'm pregnant. I wasn't... I wasn't sure if I was. But I went to the doctor and I... I am. We are. S... Say something. Wow. Iris. Iris. I... I don't know. I knew... - I knew you wouldn't be, but I just... - Iris. - Iris, it just took me by surprise. That's all. - I just hoped you... Let me tell you a story, okay? When I was 15 years old, I used to hang out at a local record store. And there was this guy who worked there who... you know, thought he knew what I liked and he handed me this album one day, and it was John Coltrane. So I took it home, and I put it on the machine. And I hated it. I mean, I really hated it. I just didn't get it. So I... played it again. I played it again, and I played it again. And then, I just couldn't stop playin' it. I kept listening to those notes. And I realized that... that's what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. You know? Make music. [Sighs] Tsk. [Sighs] What am I tryin' to say? Look, Iris. Look, you... you tell me that... we're gonna have a baby. Well... that's like falling in love with John Coltrane... all over again. If that is a lie... that is the sweetest lie I ever heard. - [Bell Rings] - Let's take our seats, please. Anybody here know the difference between the Ionian and the Dorian scale? - GIRL: Uh-yeah. - Anybody? [Chuckles] I just wanted to confirm the fact that... I've made absolutely no impact on you in the last five months. Mr. Sullivan. Yeah? What kind of music do you like to listen to? - Um... - Don't be afraid. Rock and roll. - What about you? - Rock and roll. - You? - Classical. Brownnoser. [Students Laughing] Does anybody here like Johann Sebastian Bach? Other than you. I'll bet all of you, whether you know it or not... already like Johann Sebastian Bach. ## What's this called? [Together] "Lover's Concerto." - Who wrote it? - The Toys. Wrong. That was "Minuet in G". And it was written by Johann Sebastian Bach. You hear it? # Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum # And he wrote it in 1725. They are both prime examples of the Ionian scale. Now, listen, and see if you can hear the connective tissue... between what I just played and this. [Rock and Roll] ## HOLLAND: Whoo! ## And their hands were up in the air and they were answering questions. And it was so much fun. It was rowdy, you know. It was... it was just great. Hey, hey, hey. Let... what do we think, huh? And it only took two tries and three hours. Well, you didn't realize you'd married such a handy man, did ya? But now we really don't have any space. Oh. Well... How would you feel if we moved into a house? - You're kidding. - No. But we can't afford that. If we used our savings account we could and I taught driver's ed during the summer. - You were gonna only compose this summer. - Well, we could make it work. - That'd mean taking the crib apart again. - Never. [Laughs] I'll tear a wall down first. It's up to you. - I think we should do it. - Really! Play the song you wrote that made me fall in love with you. - The song that made you fall in love with me? - Mm-hmm. The song that made you... oh! Yes, the song. - # Give me some men... - No! - # who are southearted... # - No! - No? - No. Come on. ## - Mr. Holland? - You're late. And you left your clarinet here the other day. Yeah, um, if you know anyone who wants it... I... I'm giving up the clarinet. I... I'm just... I'm just goofing everybody else up anyway. So, um, I just wanted to say thanks. Thanks for trying. Is it any fun? I wanted it to be. You know what we've been doing wrong, Miss Lang? We've been playing the notes on the page. [Machine Clicks] Well, what else is there to play? Well, there's a lot more to music than notes on a page. [The Kingsmen: "Louie, Louie"] These guys, for example. Now, they can't sing. And... and they have absolutely no harmonic sense, and... they're playing... the same three chords over and over again. And I love it. - Do you? - Yeah. [Chuckles] Yeah. Why? [Record Continues] I don't know. Yeah, ya do. - Because it's fun? - That's right. Because playing music... is supposed to be fun. It's about... heart. It's about feelings and moving people and something beautiful in being alive. And it's not about notes on a page. I could teach you notes on a page. I can't teach you that other stuff. - [Record Continues] - Do me a favor. - Pick up your clarinet and play with me. - Okay. - And this time no music, - Oh... what...? Because you already know it. It's already in your head and your fingers and your heart. You just don't trust yourself to know that. Okay, here we go. Ready? One, two, three, four. [Music] - Ah! - Okay. Let's do it again, and this time not so much lip on the mouthpiece. - Okay. - One, two, three, four. [Music] - [Note Cracks] - Oh! All right. No, no, don't do that. - Let me ask you a question. - What? When you... look in the mirror... what do you like best about yourself? My hair. Why? Well, my father always says that it reminds him of a sunset. Play the sunset. Close your eyes. - One, two, three, four. - ## [Laughing] Don't stop playing. [Piano Stops, Clarinet Continues] [Clarinet Continues] ## ## LYNDON JOHNSON: I do not find it easy... to send the flower of our youth our finest young men, into battle. But as long as there are men who hate and destroy... - [Helicopter Whirring] - We must have the courage to resist. We will stand... in Vietnam. Just relax. Try to use one foot. Try to use one foot! Try to get two feet off! That's it! Right! Right! One foot! One foot! That's it! # Keep on runnin' # # Keep on hidin' # Uh, you're goin' a little too fast. A little too fast. A little too erratically. A little too erratically. Just a little to the right... oh! # Keep on runnin' # - Okay, what have we learned from this? - # Runnin' from my arms # # One fine day I'm gonna be the one # # To make you understand # - # Oh, yeah I'm gonna be your man # - [Classical] [Classical] [Horn Honking] Whoa. That was a... that was a stop sign you went through back there, Mr. Holland. - You're definitely speeding, Mr. Holland. - Yeah. - [Tires Screeching] - [Laughing] [Horn Honking] I don't think you're just allowed to just pass on the right like that either. - [Tires Screeching] - [Horns Honking] - Geez! - [Front Seat Student Gasps] - This is a one-way street, Mr. Holland. - Mr. Hosta! Shut up! [Horns Honking] [Whimpers] [Panting] Um, um, Maternity. Thank you. [Babies Crying] [Mouthing Words] [Knocking] Iris. Come meet your son. Coltrane Holland. - How you doin'? - Okay. [Whispering] Look. - [Cooing] - Can I? Sure. Oh! He's beautiful. - [Yawning] - [Laughing] [Sputtering] [Coughing] [Piano] # I know an old lady who swallowed a fly # # I don't know why she swallowed that fly # # Perhaps she'll die # - # I know an old lady # - [Chuckling] # Who swallowed a spider # # That wiggled and jiggled # # And tickled inside her # # She swallowed the spider to catch the fly # # I don't know why # - [Laughing] - # She swallowed that fly # Perhaps she'll die The kid is a natural. It must have been all that music you played at my stomach while I was pregnant. [Upbeat Jazz] Ladies and gentlemen, Radio City Music Hall is proud to present Coltrane Gershwin Holland. ## Mr. Holland, it has come to my attention that you are teaching the students rock and roll. - Is this a problem? - "Is this a problem?" Yes, I think so. Our only job is to teach. We cannot teach and the students cannot learn if there is no discipline. Uh, I'm sorry, uh, what exactly is your point, Gene? My point is, rock and roll by its very nature leads to a breakdown in discipline. What would you like me to do? Deny that rock and roll exists? What I am... what we are saying is that you should be pushing the classics. Brahms, Mozart, Stravinsky. Stravinsky was the music of the Russian Revolution... if you want to talk about a breakdown in discipline. - You are deliberately exaggerating. - How about the Kingston Trio, Gene? - How about Sing Along With Mitch? - Oh, please! Just a minute, gentlemen. Mr. Holland, I do not want to interfere in the curriculum of any teacher. But next week I have a meeting with the school board. And there are people in this community who believe... that rock and roll is a message sent from the devil himself. Now when that issue comes up, what can I tell them? Mrs. Jacobs, you tell them... that I am teaching music... and that I will use anything... from Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock and roll... if I think it'll help me teach a student... to love music. That's... a reasonable answer, Mr. Holland. I can tell them that. Was there something else? Yes, um, have you been to any of the football games this season, Mr. Holland? I can't say that I have. No. Well, Mrs. Jacobs and I feel that there's something missing. Touchdowns. [Laughing] I'm sorry. [Laughing] What do you know about marching bands? Pardon me? Blue, 32! Set, hut! [Grunting] Get him! Get him down! [Whistle Blows] COACH MEISTER: That's the way. - MR. HOLLAND: Hey, hey, hey. - That's the way to crash down. Uh, drums and sousaphones. Come on, line up here. Sousaphones on either side. And, baritones, and, and saxes. Here. Third line. Put your shirttail in! This isn't a dance. It looks like a party dress. Get it in! Let's do it a little quicker. You know, we don't wanna be here 'til it's dark. Now, we're not... we're not even. I'd like to make some attempt to, um... Can you even up here? Can you, like, even this... Do you understand what I'm saying when I say "even up"? Line up. There you go. All right, all right. Take care of even some... next time. - Get over here! - All right. They're over there. You're over here. What are you doing? - Sorry, Coach. - Are you trying to kill me? Watch my hand, okay? One, two, three, march. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. - Left, right, left, right. - [Boy Murmuring] This is stupid. No, no, no. Left, right, left, right. - Left, right, left, right. - Hey, John, let 'em take a knee. No, no, no. We're clumping. You're clumping up. No, no, no, people. Spread out. I want you to spread! - BOY: He said "spread." - Spread out. Spread. And turn. Turn around and keep marching. Keep marching. Left, right, left, right. Left, right, left, right. Left... [Sighs] [Whistle Blowing] Stop! Take a knee. - [Football Players Laughing] - All right, start runnin'. Hats on! And don't stop 'til you hear this whistle. Glenn. Glenn. Man, oh, man, oh, man. Oh, man! I take it you were never in the army. [Both Laugh] Now, that's a stupid question. I was. Man, I marched my keister off. Well, then, help me out. Okay. You see this kid up in the stands here? That's Lou Russ. He was the greatest halfback this school ever had. I had to toss him off the team because of his grades and... now I'm about to lose him for wrestling if I don't get 'em up. Bill, what are we talkin' about? What do you want me to do? Take his tests for him? No, but I bet if he played in your band... I could talk Jacobs into giving him an academic credit... and then I'll help ya out here. - What instrument does he play? - He doesn't. He doesn't play anything. [Laughing] - What? Are you kidding? - No, he'll fit right in. Glenn, listen, you get him to play anything... and I'll get them to march. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Coach Meister... your marching buddy. You know anything at all about music, - Mr. Russ? - No, sir, coach. You don't have to say "sir", and I'm not a coach. - So Mr. Holland is just fine. - Sorry, sir... I mean, Mr. Holland. Don't apologize. You haven't done anything yet. Um... You know how to read music even a little? - No. - No. No. Well, you do realize that you're gonna have to learn... at least some of the fundamentals of music... - before you can get into the band. - Listen, Mr. Holland. I'll work hard. I know how to work hard. I'm just not a school type of person. Okay. Well, which instrument do you think you'd like to play? Well, I was kind of thinkin' like... How about electric guitar? Well, this is a marching band. The extension cord would kill us. How about the tuba? Tubas are for fat guys with pimples. Well, given the time constraints, how do drums strike you? A drum! ["The Stars And Stripes Forever"] [Humming Along] - You're ahead, Mr. Russ! - [Beating Out Of Rhythm] Get on the beat, Mr. Russ. Bum, ba, bum, ba... whoa, whoa, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What happened? Where did you go? I keep losin' my place. Well, why don't you find it? Enough of us here already think that time is a magazine. And I don't want you confusing us any further. And by the way... Mr. Barr... it is not as they say, considered couth... to empty your spit valve in the middle of the performance... especially not on the foot of the person sitting next to you. Okay... Let's, uh... take it again from the top. One, two, one, two. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop, stop. [Bell Rings] Boy, were you saved by the bell. All right, same time, same place tomorrow. Thank you very much. Mr. Holland, look, I just want you to know that... That you're gonna work very hard. I know, Louis. Thank you. - Thanks, Mr. Holland. - You're welcome. Will you tell me some stories about the chicks you met when you were on the road? That was a different time. I was a very different guy. - Check. - [Exhales] Oh, you must be keepin' something so good for me because you're always avoiding... - this line of questioning. - I'm not avoiding anything. - I know you are. - It's just, I lead a very different life now. I have a beautiful wife, a gorgeous child. Something you know nothing about. Check. - I want to have kids someday. - You ought to find a wife first. - I don't want kids that badly. - [Laughs] Checkmate. [Sighs] All right, all right, all right. Besides, the kids at school are like my kids. I wanna smack 'em sometimes, but mostly I just want to see 'em do good. So, Lou Russ. He gonna make it? Is he gonna make it? - I don't think so. - Glenn, come on. I need him! [Chuckles] A kid doesn't wrestle, it's not the end of the world. For him, it is. If he doesn't wrestle, he doesn't have anything else. It's not about wrestling. I care about the kid. Bill, how am I supposed to keep a kid in the band if he can't play an instrument? You teach him. You're telling me that you cannot teach a willing kid like Lou Russ... - to bang a drum or something? - I tried! - No, no, you teach him. - I tried and I can't. Well, then, you're a lousy teacher. And I just can't see a chance like this gettin' away from him if I can stop it. Look, I was a kid just like him. And if someone hadn't given me a chance to excel in the one thing I was good at... I never would have become the brilliant gum-chewing coach that I am. [Chuckles] I was kept off the chess team, and, well, it's ruined my life. [Laughs] Do it again. Come on.

All right. Have a good time. Ready? No, no! No, no, no, no, no! Back. - OFFICIAL: Kennedy High, get in there. - Back, back, back. Just relax. - Let's go! - Just take a deep breath. We're gonna have fun. - Let's go, Kennedy! - We're doing the best we can, damn it! Hold it. Hold it. Ready? Mr. Benson. - One, two, three, four! - [Drums Beating Cadence] [Whistle Blowing] [Cheering] [Whistle Blowing] ["Louie, Louie"] ANNOUNCER: Now we have a real treat coming down the road: The John F. Kennedy Marching Band. - [Cheering] - And aren't they good! Their first year in this parade, led by Glenn Holland. Yea! - [Laughing] - Hey! That's my boy! That's my boy! Hey, Louis! Louis! Louis! Louis! [Laughs] - Hey! - Yeah! [Fire Truck Horn Blasting] [Baby Crying] Iris. Cole. Was that fun or what? There's something wrong with Cole. - What? - I don't know, but I've... I've tried different things. Um, sneaking up behind him and... banging pots and screaming his name and stomping on the floor. He... he turned when I did that. Big smile. - He thought I was playing a game. - Iris. I don't think he can hear. Cole? [Clapping] Cole? Cole! [Clapping] Cole? [Clapping] Cole has a 90% hearing loss. Now, with training he will learn to use what hearing he has left. Treat him as if he's normal. Talk to him as if he can hear you. I notice Cole uses gestures to help himself be understood. Let me caution you, don't use them back. Gestures won't help him find his place in a hearing world. When he's older, there are schools that will help him and you to find his voice. [Beethoven: "Symphony No. 7 In A Major"] He couldn't hear. Of all people. Not a thing. And because Beethoven couldn't hear, the thought of him conducting... or let alone composing was... pathetic to most people. And so to answer them, he composed and conducted the "Seventh Symphony". [Continues] Just try to imagine... Beethoven standing on that podium... holding his baton... his hands waving gracefully through the air... and the orchestra in his mind... is playing perfectly. And the orchestra in front of him... trying desperately just to keep up. [Clicks Tongue] There is a story... that in order to write his music... Beethoven literally sawed the legs off his piano... so that he could lay the body flat on the ground. And then... he would lay down on the ground next to the piano... with his ear pressed to the floor. And he would pound the keys with his fingers... in order to hear his music through the vibrations... of the floor. Mr. Holland? Mr. Holland? If he couldn't hear, how would he even know what the notes were? Like, if he never heard a "C..." how'd he know that's what he wanted played? Well... Beethoven wasn't born deaf.

She said it's the best, and it's way ahead of any other school in the state. It's probably the most expensive place in the state. Yeah, but if it's the best! I'm just a little worried about where the money's coming from, that's all. It's probably a great place, Iris... - but I... I worry about the money, okay? - What do you want, honey? Show me. Show me what you want. Want a dessert? This? - [Trying To Speak] - I don't... I don't know what you want. - [Whining] - What? Cole. - [Whining Continues] - Dessert? No? - This? This? I don't know what you want! - So they were signing, huh? The school emphasizes it, and she said it's for parents too. What? What do you want? - Dr. Sorenson said that gestures meant... - It's way more than gestures! That gestures meant that Cole would never learn how to lip-read or to talk! He can barely talk now! He can't say two or three words! The guy is a specialist, Iris! Oh, he's a specialist who thinks that deaf people are retarded... - and he is not retarded; he's... Cole! - [Door Banging, Cole Wailing] - What does he... give him what he wants! - I don't know what he wants! I don't understand what he's trying to tell me! Don't you get it? You go off to school every day with all of your children who are normal. I can't talk to my son! I don't know what he wants... or what he thinks or what he feels; I can't tell him that I love him. I can't tell him who I am! I want to talk to my son! I don't care what it costs; I don't care what the stupid doctor says is right or wrong! I want to talk to my son! [Sobbing] [Sobbing] Oh, Cole. Oh, Cole. Okay, now we'll talk about what is today. Can you tell me what's today? Tuesday. Good. Can you spell it for me? T-U... E-S-D-A-Y. TEACHER: Wonderful! Now, can you tell me what is tomorrow? WOMAN: We encourage talking and signing at the same time. And, as you can see... today, the class is learning the days of the week and the months of the year. Would you care to step out for just a moment? - Wednesday. Great. What is yesterday? - Shall we? - GLENN: Can we talk about tuition? - Yes. - Is there any chance of government subsidy? - I'm afraid not. IRIS: Well, we can handle it. Uh, so... so how long would it be before he learns how to sign? Well, not as long as it'll take the two of you. You see, children learn very quickly, but adults... Well, so much depends on how much you put into it. - And... when would we begin? - Well, our next intensive program... the one that we gear toward parents, starts in June. It's three months, three hours every day. The most important teacher your child will ever have is you. [Bach: "Minuet In G Major"] So, who was Bach writing all this for? [Continues] Mr. Tidd, care to join us? - Uh, Lurch in the Addams Family? - [Students Laughing] [Softly] You're the Lurch, you dipstick. How 'bout I shut your smart mouth, man? - Anytime you wanna try. - GLENN: Tidd! You take one more step and you'll think you were born in detention. Get back to your seat. Stadler. Sometimes the best way to deal with a pest is to ignore them. - [Bell Rings] - Okay. Don't forget pages 280 to 314 for tomorrow. Stadler. - [Students Chattering] - [Sighs] - You stoned again, Stadler? - I don't need to stay straight for this class. I know this stuff. I can give you all the names and dates you want. I know all the scales, the modes, - counterpoint... - So what? The name of this class is Music Appreciation. I don't see you appreciating anything. - This is such lame bullshit. - Sit down. You are this close from being suspended, pal. [Stadler Exhales] You think you are real smart, don't you? Okay. Prove it. I want a paper on my desk by the end of term. I want it to be single-spaced; I want it to be annotated. I want the name of this report to be "Music: The Language of Emotion." - You can't make me do that. - Watch me! This is not extra credit. You don't do it, you flunk. This isn't fair, Mr. Holland. - Life is not fair, pal. - [Door Opens] Mr. Holland? Yeah. - You can tell Mrs. Jacobs I'll take care of it. - Okay. - Am I released yet? - No. I want you to meet me here Saturday morning at 10:00 a.m. - Why? - Research. We are honored and we are proud that we have known him. And our lives are forever changed. Louis's gifts live in each of us. Let us burn bright his spirit... his courage, his love. - Amen. - ALL: Amen. "In Flanders fields the poppies blow... "between the crosses, row on row... "that mark our place. "And in the sky, the larks, still bravely singing, fly... [Speaking With Difficulty] "Scarce heard among the guns below." So, uh, who's the... who's the one, uh... You know. Just some kid I taught to bang a drum, named Louie Russ. [Poem Continues Nearby] He made the... state wrestling finals three years running. He was never as smart as you are. He had to work real hard even to graduate. Maybe that's why it meant so much to him. [Gunshot] Aim. Fire. - [Gunshot] - Aim. Fire. [Gunshot] Present... arms. [Trumpet: "Day Is Done"] On behalf of the president of the United States and a grateful nation... I present this flag in recognition of your son, Corporal Louis Russ... for his long and faithful service to his country. About face. Forward. You can go home now. [Exhales] Hi, Glenn. - You okay? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, brother. [Breathes Deeply] What a waste. We know too many of these kids. Come on. Let's get outta here. [Chattering] Son. - Smile. - Dad. Of course, Daisy was also the former Miss Idaho. - Is that right? - Her dress is made of a potato skin. Seriously. - Will you stop it? It's very nice to meet you. - This is Glenn. - It's nice to meet you. - And this is Iris. - Hello. Hello, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Cole, say hi. This is Cole. - And Cole, my son. - MRS. JACOBS: Hello, everybody. - ALL: Hi. - Mr. Holland, a word. - Mrs. Jacobs, with you, it's never just one word. - What are your plans for the summer? - Oh, the usual, I guess. You know, the Clyde Crashcup School of Driver's Ed. What about you? Oh, I'm going to be very busy. Gardens to plant. Grandchildren to visit. I'm retiring, Mr. Holland. What? [Sighs] I've been promising my husband for several years now. It's time. I have something for you. A momento, if you will. [Chuckling, Sighs] I'm honored. Mr. Holland... of all the teachers here at John F. Kennedy High School... you're my favorite.

People, - let's get through this. - But you tell him, you know? - [Teachers Chattering] - Now. People, please! If we could move on... to the next item of the agenda, which is the senior class play. - Now... - Oh, yes, yes. Um, after our critical success... last year with Romeo and Juliet... Um... Mr. Holland and I have come up with the most wonderful idea for this year's production. Well, we're not doing a full production. We're going to do a revue. A George and Ira Gershwin revue... - with very few costumes, one set... - Much cheaper than... I know this is going to bother some of you, but I think we have to consider... cutting the senior class play altogether this year. - Are you nuts? Yes! You know what? - People. - People - Oddly enough, it's going to bother me! People, people. Please. Let's keep in mind why we are here. We're looking for things which will keep money in the school coffers, not take it away. At the expense of what? I have a responsibility to the Board of Education... and there just isn't the money to fund... - programs like this; not anymore. - Then what am I doing here? - I mean, why are we teaching any of this? - Let's just move on. This is the kind of thing that's... - important to me. - Excuse... excuse me, Gene. Yes? Bill? I think I can guarantee that this year's show will make money. - I'm listening. - What if we get some of my football players... to be the dancers in the show... and then people will show up in droves just to see them fall on their asses. Bill, I don't want to turn this into a farce. It wouldn't be a farce, because we would get them... to be better than the damn June Taylor Dancers, and then that'll shock the hell out of everybody. Who's going to teach the football players how to dance? - Me. - [Teachers Laughing] You? I minored in modern dance. - He minored in modern dance, Gene. - [Teachers Chuckling] I did. The coach had us do it... so we'd be more graceful. - Glenn, hold my leg. Come on. - Hmm.

Whoa. Whoa. Slow down. Slow down. You're goin' like a rocket. He wants to be an astronaut. Good. - Who put that stuff in his head? - As a matter of fact, his teachers. - I thought you were going to meet us. - Well, I wanted to... but I had to get these orchestrations finished by the end of the week for the kids. We're gonna do a Gershwin revue. It's always something, isn't it? If it isn't a school play, it's band practice... or grading papers or some student committee needs an advisor. Missing the science fair isn't the end of the world. - Maybe you didn't hear me this morning. - I heard you. I always hear you. - He wanted you to be there tonight! - Oh, God. You know, it's really amazing. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try... sooner or later anything I try turns out being wrong. Why is every other child more important to you than your child? - I'm a teacher, Iris! - You are his father! I'm both! I do one thing: I let him down. I do another thing: I let the school down. How the hell am I supposed to be everything for everybody? - You have to make priorities. - I have! He's my son and I love him. And I do the best I goddamn can, Ok? Well, you know what? Your best isn't good enough. So go on. Write your music. [Exhales] Write my music, huh? Write my music! When do I have time to write my music? # Won't you tell him please to put on some speed # # Follow my lead # # Oh, how I need # # Someone to watch # # Over me # That was perfect, darling. Mr. Holland. - It was good. Can I talk to her for a second? - Sure. Let's all take a break for a minute. - I was trying to sing my best. - It was fine. I just want to ask you a question. [Inhales] What do you think... the girl's really feeling here? - I don't know. - You have to know... or you can't sing it. This song is wistful, Miss Morgan. It's about a woman who is alone in a very, very cold world... and all she wants more than anything is to have someone hold her close... and to tell her that everything's gonna be all right. It's about... the need for love... in your gut. Okay? Try it again, from the top. This time I wanna do it in a lower key. [Piano] # There's a saying old # # Says that love is blind # # Still we're often told # # Seek and ye shall find # # So I'd like to seek a certain lad # # I've had in mind # - Here you go. - CUSTOMER: Thank you. Okay? All right. Hi, Mr. Holland. - Hey, Miss Morgan. - What are you working on? [Inhales] Nothing important. Just... sometimes it's easier to work here than at home. - Would you mind if I join you? - No. Not at all. Want some coffee... or tea? - Anything under a buck. - [Laughs] There's something I always remembered about your class, Mr. Holland. You have this very highly developed sense of humor. Thank you. I loved your class. The way you taught. [Exhales] You love music and you made the kids love it with you. - I always wanted to tell you that. - Well. I'm glad you did. So... you're a senior now. You got any ideas about where you're gonna go to college yet? No. My mom and dad have a little restaurant downtown. My dad's dream. He wants me to stay and help him with it. Really. What do you wanna do? - What do you mean? - Well. I mean... If you had one wish, you know? If you could do whatever it is that you really wanted to do, what would it be? Sing. I think I'd rather sing than do anything. Sometimes I dream about going to New York and being on the stage... in front of thousands of people. That's what I'd wish for. [Inhales] Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, Miss Morgan... but you have... a great talent. And if you have the passion, if you have the hunger... then you ought to go to New York... and do what you want to do, no matter what anyone tells you. Can I get you anything? No. I should get going. - See you Monday, Mr. Holland. - Yeah. I'll see you later. [Plunks Discordant Notes] Cole. Cole. Take this stuff outside. It stinks. Go open the window for him. - [Piano Resumes] - Hey, don't bust my butt. No, no, no, no! I don't believe it! - He didn't do it on purpose. - Are you kidding me? Of course he did. Cole, help clean up. Careful. Wait. Just wait, wait, wait. I'll... I'll do it myself. - Help me out here. - He said he's only trying to help. Well, he's making a bigger mess than he already has! This is off-limits, Cole. Do you understand? - Don't touch. - That's "don't sit". # We may never, never meet again # - # On the bumpy road to love # - Don't push. # Still I'll always always keep # # The memory of # # The way you hold your knife # # The way we danced 'til 3:00 # # The way you changed my life # [Chuckles] Where did you go? [Giggles] - I think we ought to call it quits. - Oh. Could we work on "Someone to Watch Over Me"? - I've been working on it. - It's pretty late. Next time, then. What's this? Oh, that's what I was working on the other night. You wrote this? Well, I... I pick at it once in a while. Would you play this for me? - [Chuckles] - Please. La, da, da, da La [Humming Along] [Inhales] It's wonderful. Is there more? Yeah. Yeah. - It's just not finished. - [Door Opens] YOUNG MAN: Ro. Are you done yet? Are we? Good night, Rowena. [Music] Who's Rowena? - Huh? - Who's Rowena? Uh... a legend. A heroine from Norse mythology. I got a book about it somewhere around here. I was just wondering what you thought would be a good night... for Cole and I to come see the show. - Opening night. - Yeah! Er, uh, no. Um, I've got a meeting on Friday with Cole's teachers. - Saturday then. - Yes. [Chuckles] Great. - [Orchestra] - [Cheering, Applause] FOOTBALL PLAYERS: # I got rhythm I got music # # I got my gal, who could ask for anything more # # I got daisies in green pastures # # I got my gal, who could ask for anything more # # Old man trouble I don't mind him # - [Calculator Beeping] - # You won't find him round my door # # I got starlight I got sweet dreams # # I got my gal, who could ask for anything more # # Who could ask for anything more # [Duet] # Still I'll always # # Always keep the memory of # # The way you hold your knife # BOY: # The way we danced 'til 3:00 # # The way you changed my life # # No, no, they can't take that away from me # # No, they can't take that away # # From me # FOOTBALL PLAYERS: # I got starlight I got sweet dreams # # I got my gal, who could ask for anything more # # Who could ask # # For anything # # Anything more # [Applause, Cheering] [Whistling] - Great! [Laughs] - MAN: Good job! GLENN: Good night, Sarah. Mr. Holland. How was I? The truth. You were great. - I owe it all to you. - [Chuckling] No. Nope. I just accompanied you. Mr. Holland, I'm doing what you said. I'm going to New York. I'm gonna be a singer. [Inhales] You know, someday, we're all gonna say that we knew you when. No, you don't understand. - I'm going tomorrow. - What? There's a party at Miss Olmstead's after we close the play. I'll be there to sort of say good-bye to my friends. They don't know... but the bus leaves from downtown at midnight; I'll be on it. Rowena. [Sighs] Oh, Rowena. You know, when I said that you should go to New York, I didn't mean right away. - You have so much time. - If I wait, I'll never do it. I'll end up waiting tables or working in some store. It has to be now. You could come with me. I know you think I'm just a kid. - I know you're married and you have a son. - Rowena. I know. Don't you see? You could be writing great music. The bus stops at King's Drugstore, tomorrow night.

Do you wanna come? Um, I should get Cole home. Okay, okay. Well, I'm not gonna be late. All right? Okay. You pack light. You got a place to stay? Y. W. C. A. That's the name of a guy that I used to play in a band with. I've already called him. He and his wife are expecting you. This isn't the way I imagined it. But it's the best way. [Bus Approaching] Good-bye, Rowena. [Exhales] [Sighs] I love you. I know. MALE NEWSCASTER: Tonight John Lennon is dead. A victim of what police call "a deranged man". FEMALE NEWSCASTER: The spirit of the Beatles is dead tonight at the age of 40. MALE NEWSCASTER: The mood was silence and reverence... at the appointed hour of 11:00. But as the crowd continued singing the Beatles' songs... the songs of John Lennon... they became happier, vibrant, more spirited. That was the purpose of John Lennon's music and his life. At O'Bryan Square in southwest Portland, this is Jim Collins reporting. [Dog Barking] What happened to your eye? Sorry? - Later. - [Tool Clanks] In a second! Someone was... was killed. No, no, Cole. That's not funny. John... Lennon. The musician. [Sighs Deeply] You wouldn't understand. You okay? It's so sad. [Door Slams] - [Exhales] - Cole, what is it? He wants to what? He wants to tell you something. He wants to be sure you understand. - Couldn't we do this another time? - Now! Why do you assume that John Lennon's death would mean nothing to me? Do you think I'm stupid? - I know who John Lennon is... - I never said that he... I... I can't read your lips if you don't look at me. I never said that you were stupid. You must think so... if you think I don't know who the Beatles are or any music at all. You think I don't care about what it is that you do or what you love? You're my father. I know what music is. You could help me to know it better, but... no. You care more about teaching other people than you do about me. - [Door Opens, Closes] - Iris. [Clears Throat] What does this mean? That means "asshole". [Exhales] Come to bed. It's really late. I was only tryin'... [Sighs] Protect him. I just didn't wanna see him hurt... or disappointed. Hmm. [Engine Revving] [Revving Continues] The second, uh, would be, uh, if there are songs with words, you will need an interpreter. Someone to sign the words... - along with the music. - Okay, so what we can... - We can do two kinds of listening. - Right. The... the first kind would be the... the pure music without words. - The music. The music. - The pure music without words... that they could experience through putting themselves closer to the language. The lights. Maybe lights flashing. [Beethoven: "Symphony No. 3 In E flat Major"] [Applause, Whistling] Ah! Did you like that? Okay. Okay. For our final selection tonight, we are going to do a song by John Lennon. Now, to those of you in our audience who cannot hear... this evening you will be grateful for your hearing difficulties... because I am going to sing. - [Laughing] - And to those of you who... have no hearing problems... my profound apologies. [Audience Laughing] Um. [Embarrassed Chuckle] On a personal note... [Sighs] I would like to dedicate this song... to my son... Cole.

All right. I'll come right to the point. You know how acrimonious the budget meeting was at the Board of Education meeting... last Tuesday. Be that as it may... each school in the district has been asked... to submit proposals on ways of reducing costs by ten percent by September. This is what I've decided. [Sighs] [Chuckles] The entire music program. And art. And drama. Well, congratulations, Gene. You've been lookin' for a way to get rid of me for 30 years... and they finally gave you an excuse. You know, I'm not as popular as you. I'm not anybody's favorite anything. That's because you're the enemy, - Gene. You just don't know it. - But... I care about these kids just as much as you do. And if I'm forced to choose between Mozart and reading and writing and long division... I choose long division. Well, I guess you can cut the arts as much as you want, Gene. Sooner or later, these kids aren't gonna have anything to read or write about. Mr. Holland. If there's anything I can do. [Laughs] A recommendation. I'm 60 years old, Gene. What are you gonna do? Write me a recommendation for the morgue? - Jacobs would've fought this. - She would've lost. Yes, she would've lost, but she would have fought this. And so will I! No. No. Do not misunderstand me. I am not talking about my job! I am talking about the education that students once got at Kennedy High... versus the education that you people are willing to give these kids today. We have been going over and over this, Mr. Holland. We've done all we can. Then, do it again. That's what I used to tell you when you were my student, Michael... and it served you pretty well then. - Well, that was a different time, Mr. Holland. - I don't think the time... was that different; I think that more was expected of us. - Fifteen seconds. - I think that the big difference... is how little you people care. - And how lazy you've become. - I resent your tone, Mr. Holland. And I don't think you have any real appreciation for our financial problems. Oh, come on, Michael! You know the big problem here is that you people are willing to... create a generation of children who will not have the ability to think. - Or create. Or listen. - BOARD OFFICIAL: Time, Mr. Holland. MICHAEL: Mr. Holland, as I've said, we've done the best that we can. Your best is not good enough! "A very flattering offer has been made to me to teach... at a university for the deaf in Washington, D. C. I'm not sure that I'm going to take it... because I'm fond of the students in the school that I'm at now. It's something to think about. No girlfriends yet... at least not serious ones. And tell Dad that I'm never going to give his car back. Love always, Cole". [No Audible Dialogue] BILL: Hey! Hey. What are you doin' here? You know, I had some jock straps in the rinse cycle down in the locker room. - Came to see if you needed any help. - Nope. No, no, no. So you decided what you're gonna do yet? Too old to start a rock band. Probably hang out a shingle and teach a few piano lessons. [Exhales] - I'd love to retire. I'd... - I'm not retiring, Bill. I'm getting dumped. [Sighs] And I don't think you have anything to worry about. The day they cut the football budget in this state, well, now... that will be the end of western civilization as we know it. [Sighs] I'll tell you the truth. [Chuckles] I'm scared to death. They have no idea how much they're gonna miss you around here. - You really think so? - What, do you doubt it? Well, as a matter of fact, yeah. It's almost funny. I got dragged into this gig kicking and screaming... and now, it's the only thing I want to do, and... [Sighs] You work your whole life. You work for 30 years because you think that what you do makes a difference. You think it matters to people. Then you wake up one morning, and you find out, well, no, you've... you've made a little error there. You are... expendable. [Inhales Deeply] Oh, God. [Chuckles] Oh, I should be laughing. You sure you don't need any help, huh? All right. [Sighs Deeply] [Door Opens, Car Horn Honking] [Door Closes] [Honking Continues] Dad! What are you doing here? School is out for me too. The old car. It looks pretty good. It's a classic. You can't have it back. [Door Opens] No, no. You don't have to do this. I don't want an old fart like you to strain yourself. Okay, okay, asshole. [Sighs] That's enough, you two. Let's go out to the car. [Clears Throat] [Piano] Now what is that? Um, I don't know. What? You can't hear what's going on in the auditorium? - Oh, yeah. I... I... I hear it, but... - Well, there's something going on in there. - There isn't supposed to be... - Well, it could be a summer program. No, the summer programs don't start for another couple of weeks. ## ["Louie, Louie"] # Oh, oh, we gotta move now # [Cheering, Applause] Mr. Holland! Mr. Stadler? I wouldn't have missed it, Mr. Holland. Hi, Cole. Uh, I'll sign myself. Uh, hello. [Clears Throat] Our master of ceremonies seems to be a little late... so I guess it's up to me to begin. Um, when word first got out that the music program was cut... and about the retirement of my husband... Well, I've never seen such a response from the community. Oh, looks like my watch is fast. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, may I present our governor... and Kennedy High School alumnus the most Honorable Gertrude Lang. - Gertrude. - [Chuckles] It's been a long time. [Chuckles] - Thank you so much for coming. - Oh, thank you. My... my apologies for my tardiness, and, uh, Principal Wolters... I'd like you to know... yes, I brought a note from my mother. [Audience Laughing] Mr. Holland had a profound influence on my life. On a lot of lives, I know. And, yet, I get the feeling... that he considers a great part of his own life misspent. Rumor had it, he was always working on this symphony of his... and this was going to make him famous, rich. Probably both. But Mr. Holland isn't rich... and he isn't famous... at least not outside of our little town. So it might be easy for him to think himself a failure. And he would be wrong... because I think he's achieved a success far beyond riches and fame. Look around you. There is not a life in this room that you have not touched. And each one of us is a better person because of you. We are your symphony, Mr. Holland. We are the melodies and the notes of your opus. - And we are the music of your life. - [Cheering, Applause] Whoo! Mr. Holland, we would now like to give something back to you. To you and to your wife... who, along with you, has waited 30 years for what we are about to hear. If you will, would you please come up here and take this baton... and lead us in the first performance ever... of "The American Symphony" by Glenn Holland.
