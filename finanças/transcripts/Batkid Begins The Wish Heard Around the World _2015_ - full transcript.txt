SO LET ME EXPLAIN HOW THIS HAPPENED. I'M NOT REALLY SURE I CAN, ACTUALLY, BUT HERE GOES. Natalie: MILES, WHEN HE WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS, NINETEEN MONTHS OLD, HE CAME INTO BED WITH NICK AND I, AND IT WAS ON A SUNDAY MORNING. AND WE HAD NOTICED THERE WAS A LITTLE LUMP, LIKE, RIGHT NEAR HIS JAW. AND IT WASN'T PALPABLE. IT JUST WAS KINDA HARD, AND SO WE WERE LIKE, "THAT'S REALLY WEIRD." AND WE TOOK HIM TO AN URGENT CARE, AN IMMEDIATE CARE, IN KLAMATH FALLS THAT DAY. AND THEY SAID, "OH, HE HAS AN EAR INFECTION." WHICH WE WERE LIKE, "THAT'S REALLY WEIRD. THAT DOESN'T REALLY RELATE TO THIS. HE'S NOT COMPLAINING OF EAR PAIN." HE STARTED ANTIBIOTICS AND THEN WE FOLLOWED UP WITH HIS DOCTOR THE NEXT WEEK. I'M A NURSE, AND I WAS ACTUALLY WORKING FOR THE DOCTOR, FOR MILES'S DOCTOR. AND I HAD NICK BRING MILES UP, AND THEY DID THE BLOOD WORK. AND THEN THEY LEFT, 'CAUSE HE WAS KIND OF FUSSY AND TIRED. WHEN DR. BRITCH CAME OUT, I KNEW. I SAW HER FACE. [ PHONE RINGS ] Nick: NATALIE CALLED ME IN JUST ABSOLUTELY IN HYSTERICS [ PHONE RINGS ] Nick: NATALIE CALLED ME IN JUST ABSOLUTELY IN HYSTERICS JUST SCREAMING, CRYING. AND SHE TRIED TO TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT SHE WAS SAYING. "OKAY, YOU GOTTA STOP AND SLOW DOWN, 'CAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU JUST SAID," AND...AND SAID, "MILES HAS LEUKEMIA. WE NEED TO PACK, AND THEN WE GOTTA BE ON A PLANE AT SEVEN." AND I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK. WELL, HE HAD AN IV PUT IN, AND WE WERE ON AN AIR FLIGHT, PANDA FLIGHT, TO PORTLAND. AT THAT TIME, HE WAS A REAL DADDY'S BOY AND SO I HAD TO FLY WITH HIM, AND NATALIE'S TERRIFIED OF FLYING. AND HE WASN'T GONNA BE ON A GURNEY BY HIMSELF, AND SO I WAS STRAPPED TO THE GURNEY. HE WAS STRAPPED TO ME, ON TOP OF IT. SO WE GOT UP THERE, AND NATALIE AND HER MOM DROVE UP THERE THAT NIGHT. THEY DROVE ALL NIGHT. Natalie: THEN WE WERE IN PORTLAND FOR THREE WEEKS. AND THE FIRST WEEK WE WERE INPATIENT, AND THEN THE THE NEXT TWO WEEKS WE WERE AT RONALD McDONALD HOUSE. WHEN HE WAS IN PORTLAND, HE HAD BONE MARROW BIOPSIES AND LUMBAR PUNCTURES, AND THEN, UH, DAILY CHEMO. AND THEN, UM, HE HAD A BLOOD TRANSFUSION. Nick: WE HAD TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM A LOT OF CROWDS, YOU KNOW, WITH THE WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM. Natalie: SO AFTER THAT, HE WENT EVERY THREE MONTHS, HAVING A LUMBAR PUNCTURE, BUT EVERY MONTH HE WOULD GET CHEMO. WHEN MILES WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED, WITHIN THAT FIRST COUPLE WEEKS, WE MET UP WITH A SOCIAL WORKER, AND-AND THEY TOLD US THAT HE QUALIFIED FOR MAKE-A-WISH. Patricia: IT'S FOR CHILDREN WITH LIFE-THREATENING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM GO ON TO LIVE INTO ADULTHOOD. THEY GET TO PICK WHATEVER WOULD MAKE THEM THE HAPPIEST. Nick: AND BEING EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD, WE SAID, "NO, WE DON'T WANNA DO IT NOW. LET'S HOLD OFF AND WAIT TILL HE FINDS SOMETHING HE LIKES AND GO WITH IT." IT WAS THE LAST YEAR OF TREATMENT FOR HIM THAT WE ASKED ABOUT IT AGAIN, AND, UH, SHE SAID, "YEAH, WE'LL PUT IN THE REQUEST." WE'D MET THE COUPLE THAT DID OUR INTERVIEW FOR MAKE-A-WISH AT NATALIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE IN YREKA. Natalie: THE WIFE DID PAPERWORK WITH NICK AND I, AND THE HUSBAND JUST TOOK MILES ASIDE AND HE DREW PICTURES... Nick: ...AND TRIED TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT HE LIKES. AND HE CAME BACK AFTER ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR AND SAID MILES WISHED TO BE BATMAN. HE SAID, "I WANNA BE THE REAL BATMAN," WAS HIS EXACT WISH. WASN'T, YOU KNOW, "I WANNA ACT LIKE BATMAN. I WANT A BATMAN SUIT." IT WAS "I WANT TO BE BATMAN." Natalie: I-WE WERE JUST REALLY WONDERING HOW THAT WAS GONNA WORK OUT. [ LAUGHS ] HOW ARE YOU GONNA BE THE REAL BATMAN? HOW DO YOU DO THAT, YOU KNOW? WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO THINK. Patricia: OUR PROGRAM DIRECTOR LINDA WENT POPPING IN MY OFFICE, AND SHE SAYS, "I HAVE A SUPERHERO WISH FOR YOU." SO I WAS LIKE, "I'LL TAKE THAT!" SO I TOOK THE FILE, AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANT FOR HIM TO BE BATMAN. YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF CHILD HE WAS, WHAT KIND OF WISH THIS MIGHT BE, AND JUST REALLY GET A SENSE OF THE FAMILY AND HIM. Natalie: WE LIVE IN TULELAKE, CALIFORNIA. IT'S RIGHT ON THE CALIFORNIA-OREGON BORDER. QUIET, QUAINT SMALL TOWN, NOT MUCH GOING ON. REALLY TIGHT-NICHE COMMUNITY. VERY NICE PLACE TO LIVE. NICK AND I ACTUALLY WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER, ELEMENTARY, JUNIOR HIGH. AND WE DATED IN JUNIOR HIGH. "DATED," RIGHT? THAT'S NOT REAL. Nick: I GREW UP RIGHT HERE ON A FARM. I'M THE FOURTH-GENERATION FARMER IN THIS AREA. WE HAVE HAY AND GRAIN NOW. IT WAS HARD 'CAUSE HE WAS DIAGNOSED IN APRIL AND THAT'S WHEN WE START REALLY GETTING BUSY PLANTING. AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE JUST GETTING OUR FARM KINDA ON THE GROUND. FRESHLY MARRIED, DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, AND THE WHOLE TOWN, LIKE, CAME TOGETHER. OTHER GUYS HAD THEIR CREW SENT OUT HERE TO PUT UP PIPE FOR US. ALL THE OTHER FARMERS CHIPPED IN. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I'M CUTTING THE GROUND. AND SO ONE NIGHT, THE OLD ADAM WEST "BATMANS" WERE ON NICKELODEON, I THINK, AT THAT TIME, AND SO, LIKE THEY WERE JUST WATCHING "BATMAN." HE JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. AND SO FOR WEEKS THERE, EVERY NIGHT WE'D WATCH "BATMAN." AND SO THAT WAS HIS INTRODUCTION TO SUPERHEROES. Man: WHY DO YOU LIKE BATMAN SO MUCH? BECAUSE HE'S MY FAVORITE SUPERHERO. Nick: I THINK IT'S BECAUSE BATMAN'S JUST A REGULAR GUY. I MEAN, HE DOESN'T HAVE A SUPERPOWER. HE'S GOT GADGETS AND MONEY. HE'S ALWAYS LIKED ALL SUPERHEROES AND STUFF, BUT HE ALWAYS KINDA COMES BACK TO BATMAN, BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS HIS FIRST, YOU KNOW, LIKE, FIRST LOVE-TYPE THING. ONE OF HIS DOCTORS, I THINK, TOLD US THAT WITH THIS DISEASE, THEY JUST BECOME LIKE A FIGHTER, YOU KNOW. THEY HAVE TO BE. THEY FIGHT FOR LIFE AND STUFF. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BATMAN SEES THE BAD GUYS? Miles: HE FIGHTS. Nick: AND SO I THINK HE SEES THE GOOD VERSUS EVIL BATTLE IN SUPERHEROES AND JUST RELATES TO IT. Natalie: HE HAD TO TAKE STEROIDS EVERY MONTH FOR FIVE DAYS, AND THAT WAS WHAT TOOK THE MOST TOLL ON HIM, 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE WAY HE FELT, AND IT MADE HIM REALLY MOODY, AND HUNGRY, AND TIRED. AND HE'D HAVE NIGHTMARES. Nick: AND IT'S NOT JUST MILES. I THINK IT'S ALL KIDS THAT HAVE A DISEASE OR, YOU KNOW, AN ILLNESS LIKE THAT, THEY GET MORE COMPASSION AND THEY WANT TO HELP PEOPLE. AND SUPERHEROES, IN GENERAL, ARE HELPING PEOPLE. WELL, THE FIRST THING HE EVER HAD OF BATMAN WAS A PAIR OF PAJAMAS. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN INTO DRESSING UP. THAT'S BEEN SINCE DAY ONE. LIKE FOR CHRISTMAS, HIS FIRST FOUR YEARS OF LIFE, IT WAS LIKE, "I WANT CLOTHES AND PAJAMAS," WHICH-- WHAT KID SAYS THAT, YOU KNOW? HE WANTS COSTUMES TO DRESS UP. I THINK HE JUST LIKES TO PUT ON THE COSTUME AND BECOME WHOEVER THAT PERSON IS. HE USED TO CALL HIMSELF THE CHANGER BOY. "I'M A CHANGER BOY!" AND HE WOULD JUST CHANGE ALL THE TI-- HE COULD WEAR COSTUMES TO THE HOSPITAL. HIS DOCTORS AND EVERYONE, THEY WERE LIKE, "OH, WHAT SUPERHERO ARE YOU WEARING TODAY?" WHEN WE'RE GOING ABOUT, UH, DOING A WISH, IT IS WHIMSICAL. AND IT'S ABOUT USING YOUR IMAGINATION AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD WOW THAT CHILD AND GIVE THEM AN EXPERIENCE THAT GIVES THEM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR CHILDHOOD BACK THAT'S BEEN ROBBED. YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES, AND SAY, "WHAT WOULD BE GREAT?" [ CHILDREN SHOUT ] Miles: THAT'S FUN! Patricia: THE WISH FAMILY ASKED FOR HIS WISH TO BE IN NOVEMBER BECAUSE IT WAS GONNA BE AFTER HIS TREATMENT. IT WAS GONNA BE AFTER HIS SURGERY TO HAVE HIS PORT REMOVED. SO IT WOULD BE AFTER HIS HARVEST SEASON. SO NOVEMBER MADE GOOD SENSE, AND HE'D HAVE MORE ENERGY NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. IT GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN SOME OF HIS DARKER DAYS. WHAT WE BEGAN PLAYING WITH IS TO DO S-- MAYBE AN EPISODE, YOU KNOW, AND HAVE HIM HAVE THESE CAPERS. SO I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO HAVE A FULL-SIZE, A-A GROWN-UP BATMAN, AND HE WOULD BE THE KIND OF MINI-ME. UH, SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS A PERFECT, UH, FIT FOR HIS WISH, SO THAT HE WOULD HAVE A BUDDY. AND THEN I REACHED OUT TO EJ AND ASKED HIM TO BE BATMAN. SHALL WE DO IT? Man: WE SHOULD DO IT. WHOA. SHE SENT EMAILS SAYING, "THERE'S A LITTLE GUY WHOSE WISH IS TO LEARN TO BE BATMAN. YOU KNOW, CRIME-FIGHTING, ACROBATICS, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER BATMAN DOES, THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO." Patricia: WHEN I SENT THE EMAIL TO HIM, HIS WIFE, SUE, SAW IT FIRST. AND HE GOES, "I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THIS, DO I?" AND SHE SAID, "NOPE." [ LAUGHS ] EJ: HECK, YES. LET'S DO IT. GIVE ME THE SUIT. Patricia: HE'S A FORMER STUNT DOUBLE AND ACROBAT. HE'S AN INVENTOR. HE CREATES GADGETS. HE DOES EVERYTHING. Patricia: AND HE'S JUST SO GREAT WITH KIDS. TEN YEARS AGO, EJ AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON A WISH. EJ: IT WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD LEUKEMIA PATIENT NAMED BEN, WHOSE WISH WAS TO MAKE A VIDEO GAME WHERE THE PLAYER FIGHTS CANCER SO THAT HE COULD SEND IT BACK TO THE FRIENDS OF HIS WHO WERE STILL STUCK IN TREATMENT. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL IDEA. I APPROACHED SOME OF THE VIDEO GAME COMPANIES AND WAS LAUGHED AT, AND SAID, YOU KNOW, "I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT. WE'RE TALKING A MILLION DOLLARS OF VALUE. AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO, AND YOU'RE-YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE THIS TIME." I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH WHAT BEN WANTED TO DO, THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO TAKE BUT TIME. Patricia: FOR SEVEN MONTHS, UM, EJ WORKED WITH BEN EVERY WEEK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE, WHEN BEN WAS GROUNDED, UH, FOR NOT DOING HIS HOMEWORK BUT CREATED, UM, THIS GREAT VIDEO GAME THAT'S BEEN DOWNLOADED OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES. THIS IS THE MOST FULFILLING PROJECT I'VE WORKED ON. HE BROUGHT IN GAME IDEAS THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE COME UP WITH. HE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN SOMETHING CALLED A PORT ONE DAY, IN A JAR, WHICH IS A DEVICE THAT THEY IMPLANTED INSIDE HIM. AND HE SAID, "THIS IS HOW THE PLAYER GETS INTO THE GAME." Patricia: BOTH OF THEM ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE DALAI LAMA FOR THEIR UNSELFISH ACTS. I KNEW THAT IT'D BE MAGIC WITH HIM. AND THEN IT WAS, "LET'S DECIDE WHERE IT'S GONNA BE," AND I PRESENTED SEVERAL OPTIONS OF DOING SOMETHING IN THEIR HOMETOWN OF TULELAKE OR SOMETHING NEAR THEM. I FIGURED IT WOULD PROBABLY BE, YOU KNOW, IN A PARK. KIND OF A FAMILY, AND MAYBE SOME FRIENDS OF HIS, AND, YOU KNOW, PUT ON A BATMAN SUIT AND DO SOME STUNTS AND ACROBATICS. MAYBE HAVE SOME MATS THERE AND A LITTLE TRAMPOLINE. WE DIDN'T WANNA DO IT HERE 'CAUSE WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE, BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ON MANY FAMILY VACATIONS. OR I HAD THIS BOLD STATEMENT, WHICH I MAKE, THAT I WAS GONNA TURN SAN FRANCISCO INTO GOTHAM CITY AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT RESONATED AND SOUNDED MOST TRUE AND NEAR HIS REAL WISH. SO IT JUST MADE MORE SENSE TO GO TO THE CITY. Patricia: SO I HAD THIS VISION THAT THERE WAS GONNA BE A BREAKING NEWS STORY. Daetz: I THOUGHT, "SURE! THAT'D BE AWESOME. THAT'D BE SO MUCH FUN." I CAN SEE, "BREAKING NEWS: BATMAN IS NEEDED IN THE CITY." Patricia: I KNEW I WANTED TO INVOLVE THE POLICE CHIEF. AND THEY SAID, "HEY, THIS LITTLE GUY LOVES COPS, AND HE WANTS TO BE BATMAN FOR A DAY. DO YOU THINK WE COULD DO IT?" Patricia: RESCUING A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS. Sue: WHILE THE CATWOMAN OUTFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN FABULOUS I HAVE TO SAY, I THINK THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO KIND OF BE THE HERO AND RESCUE ME WAS REALLY WONDERFUL. I'D HEARD THAT THEY WERE GONNA SHUT DOWN A CITY BLOCK AND RESCUE SOMEONE OFF A CABLE CAR. AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, THAT...THAT'S NEAT." Patricia: WHEN YOU HAVE A WISH LIKE THIS, IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF BIG ENDING. AND I THOUGHT, WHAT BETTER BIG ENDING THAN TO HAVE THE MAYOR PRESENT THE KEY TO THE CITY? Mayor Lee: I GREW UP READING THE COMICS. I'VE WATCHED EVERY BATMAN MOVIE THAT WAS EVER MADE, AND, UH, OF COURSE, WATCHED THE TELEVISION SERIES GOING UP. Patricia: AND I REMEMBER SUGGESTING THAT. BEING SO BOLD, GOING, "CAN HE HAVE A KEY TO THE CITY?" AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOME CRITERIA FOR THAT. YEAH, OF COURSE. LET'S-LET'S DO SOMETHING, AND WE'LL KEEP IT VERY SIMPLE. KINDA WHY I'M GOOD FOR IT, I JUST KINDA GO. I ASK QUESTIONS LATER. I'M ASSUMING BY NOW THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA BE WATCHING THIS HAVE MET PATRICIA WILSON BEFORE. Fajardo: SMALL OR BIG, YOU DON'T SAY NO TO PATRICIA. Suhr: THE ANSWER'S ALWAYS YES. IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY NO TO PATRICIA. Clovicko: SHE IS A BIG THINKER AND SHE ALLOWS YOU TO NOT ONLY THINK IN THE SAME WAY, BUT ALSO CHALLENGES YOU TO DO SO. Patricia: I REMEMBER GOING TO LUNCH WITH ONE OF OUR FORMER BOARD MEMBERS WHO HAD A CRAZY CAR. I TEXTED HIM ONE DAY AND SAID, "WHAT KIND OF CAR LOOKS LIKE THE BATMOBILE?" AND HE SAID, "MINE." AND I SAID, "RIGHT ANSWER." [ LAUGHS ] AND EVERYONE SAID YES ON THIS PROJECT. THEY NOT ONLY SAID YES, THEY SAID, "HOW ELSE CAN I HELP?" I HAVE TWO BOYS. I SEE THEM IN HIM. MY-MY OLDER SON GOT WRAPPED UP IN THIS THING, TOO. Patricia: I THINK EVERYBODY REMEMBERS BEING A KID AND WANTING TO BE A SUPERHERO. SO IT STRIKES A CHORD. WELL, I WANTED ENOUGH VOLUNTEERS AT EACH CAPER TO MAKE SURE HE WAS SAFE, AND IT WAS FRIENDLY, AND PEOPLE CHEERING HIM ON, SO HE'D FEEL LIKE THAT SUPERHERO. TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE SOUNDS LIKE A CROWD. I THINK THE MOST WE'VE HAD FOR A PUBLIC WISH? WE HAD A CHILD WHO WANTED TO BE KASSAUNDRA, TO BE A FAMOUS SINGER. I THINK THE MOST, MAYBE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE TO FILL THE BALLROOM. IT WAS STANDING ROOM ONLY. IT WAS PRETTY COOL. SO THAT WAS KIND OF MY THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE. SO OUR GOAL WAS TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS THERE TO CHEER, AND-AND THEN HE'LL FEEL GREAT. I ASKED FOR TWO MOTORCYCLE COPS FOR POLICE ESCORTS FOR THE BATMOBILES AND TWO PARKING SPOTS. EJ: WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE VILLAINS ARE. THE JOKER IS TOO CREEPY FOR A FIVE-YEAR-OLD. HE'S TOO CREEPY FOR, YOU KNOW, GROWN-UPS. YOU KNOW, I WAS TRYING TO THINK THROUGH WHO, YOU KNOW, WHO OF OUR FRIENDS WOULD MAKE A GOOD SUPERVILLAIN. AND THAT NIGHT, SUE AND I WERE ON OUR WAY TO A BARBECUE AT MIKE'S PLACE. AND SUE, WHO IS MY LOVELY MUSE. IN OUR RELATIONSHIP, ONE OF HER JOBS IS SHE HAS THE GENIUS IDEAS. AND SO SHE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, SAID, "MIKE." AND I LOOKED AT HER. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT, AND SHE SAID, "PENGUIN." I WAS LIKE [GASPS] I WORK HERE AT LUCASFILM, AND, UM, I'VE BEEN A SOFTWARE ENGINEER HERE FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS. I MET EJ HERE AT INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC, AND WE'RE SORT OF WEIRD SOFTWARE PEOPLE, LIKE AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE--THE BACKDROP HERE. THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU USUALLY SEE IN A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING COMPANY. UM, OF COURSE WE MAKE- WE MAKE FILMS HERE. EJ: WE WENT OVER TO HIS PLACE AND GOT TO THE BARBECUE. SAID HI, GRABBED A BURGER, AND THEN SAID, "OKAY, ARE YOU IN TOWN ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH?" SO I JUST KIND OF PULL OUT MY PHONE, I'M LIKE, UH... EJ: IF SO, THEN SAY YES TO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO ASK. I SAID, "OH, YEAH, LOOKS OPEN. YOU KNOW, UH, SURE." 'CAUSE I FIGURED, IT'S ERIC, AND SO IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING CRAZY. HE'S GONNA BE UP TO SOMETHING TOTALLY RIDICULOUS. OF COURSE IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING, AND I'M GONNA WANNA BE A PART OF IT. AND SO, YEAH, I JUST SAID YES, AND THEN ASKED WHAT I'D AGREED TO. AND HE SAID, "WELL, I NEED YOU TO PUT ON A-A KIND OF A- PUT ON A COSTUME AND GET CHASED AROUND BY A KID FOR A WHILE. UM, IT'S JUST SOMETHING SMALL, YOU KNOW, NOTHIN' BIG." IT-IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP YOUR ADULT SENSIBILITIES ABOUT YOU WHEN HE'S INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON SOFTWARE, YOU GO, "OH, WE WANNA LIMIT THE FEATURES WE HAVE IN THIS SOFTWARE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE SO MUCH TIME, AND THERE'S THE SCHEDULE. BUT WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF IT DID THIS AND THIS AND THIS? YES! I'M GONNA STAY EXTRA TO DO THAT." AND YOU DO, AND IT ENDS UP BEING GREAT 'CAUSE THEN YOU START THINKING, "OH, AND." I STARTED WATCHING YouTubes OF ALL THE OTHER SUPERHERO MAKE-A-WISHES THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE U.S. EJ: AND THAT'S THE ENTHUSIASM THAT IT TAKES TO DO SOMETHING AMAZING. IF I MAKE THE KID CRY, I FAILED MISERABLY. EJ: THE PROJECT CHANGED WHEN WE ADDED MIKE. HIS ENERGY SEEPED INTO IT. SO WE HAD A FEW MEETINGS. WE HAD PLANNING MEETINGS. AND THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE, LIKE, A PHONE OR A TABLET THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT THE VIDEO ON AT EACH ADVENTURE, BEFORE WE WENT OFF TO THE NEXT THING SO THAT MILES COULD SEE THE POLICE CHIEF. HOLY BATWINGS, BATMAN AND BATKID! EJ: IF I PULL OUT A PHONE TO SEE THE POLICE CHIEF'S MESSAGE, IN MILES'S EYES, I GO FROM BEING BATMAN TO BEING A GROWN-UP ON A PHONE. I THINK--I THINK WE SHOULD TRY INSTEAD OF A PHONE PROJECTING IT, LIKE BATMAN. I HAD DONE A PROJECT OF MY OWN A COUPLE OF YEARS PRIOR THAT INVOLVED A WEARABLE PROJECTOR. IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A WAY MORE KIND OF BATMAN-ISH THING TO DO. Suhr: GOTHAM CITY NEEDS YOU, BATMAN. Patricia: I PLANNED IT INITIALLY JUST BY MYSELF. IT'S LIKE I THROW EVERYTHING UP IN THE AIR AND GO, "NOW-NOW YOU HAVE TO DO THE DETAILS." SO THEN TERESA AND JEN GOT INVOLVED AND REALLY BEGAN PUTTING THE SPECIFICS, AND THE FEW OTHER PIECES THAT WE NEEDED. MAKE-A-WISH. THIS IS TERESA. Clovicko: I PLAN THE LOGISTICS OF THE WISHES. BASICALLY COORDINATING WISHES. SOMETIMES, THAT MEANS TRAVEL COORDINATING. SOMETIMES, THAT MEANS COORDINATING WISHES TO BE LIKE MILES. AT FIRST, WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE, YOU KNOW, A-A-A LITTLE GUY. KIND OF LIKE A PORTION OF THE DAY. DEFINITELY NOT AN ABNORMAL WISH THAT WOULD-THAT WOULD ENTAIL SO MUCH PLANNING. Patricia: SO THE PLAN IS THIS: WE'RE GONNA START WITH MILES IN HIS HOTEL ROOM. HIS MOM'S GONNA POP IN A DVD. IT'S GONNA HAVE A BREAKING NEWS STORY FEATURING THE CHIEF OF POLICE. AND HE'S GONNA BE ASKING FOR HIS HELP. THEN BATMAN WILL KNOCK ON THE DOOR. AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME HE SEES BATMAN. SO IT SHOULD BE GREAT. BATMAN WILL HAND HIM HIS COSTUME AND ASK HIM TO REPORT TO DUTY. THEN THEY GO DOWN TO THE LOADING DOCK, WHICH IS REALLY THE BATCAVE, AND THEY'RE GONNA GET INTO THE BATMOBILE, AND WILL EXIT UNION SQUARE IN DRAMATIC FLAIR, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SMOKE AND EXCITEMENT. AND THEN THEY HEAD TO THE CORNER OF HYDE AND GREEN, WHERE OUR DAMSEL IN DISTRESS WILL BE TIED TO THE CABLE CAR TRACKS. MILES WILL DEFUSE THE BOMB, AND RESCUE HER JUST IN TIME TO GET ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF OF POLICE, TELLING HIM THE RIDDLER IS ROBBING A BANK, AND HE NEEDS HIS HELP. THEY'LL GET BACK IN THE BATMOBILE, AND RACE TO THE CLOTHING STORE WINGTIP WHICH IS REALLY THE OLD BANK OF ITALY BUILDING. THEY'LL CATCH THE RIDDLER RIGHT IN THE ACT, AND SAVE THE DAY. THEN THEY'LL GET ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF OF POLICE, SAYING, "GREAT JOB," AND LUNCH IS ON HIM. SO THEY'LL GO TO LUNCH AT BURGER BAR, OVERLOOKING UNION SQUARE. AND JUST AS THEY ARE FINISHING THEIR LUNCH, THEY'LL GET ANOTHER BREAKING MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF, SAYING THAT THE PENGUIN'S UP TO NO GOOD. HE'S KIDNAPPED LOU SEAL, THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS MASCOT. THEN HE'LL LOOK OUT ON UNION SQUARE, SEE A FLASH MOB, AND THEN SEE THE PENGUIN COMING OUT OF THE PARKING LOT WITH LOU SEAL TIED UP IN THE BACK OF THE CAR. IT'LL BE A CONVERTIBLE. AND THEY'LL BEGIN THE CHASE AFTER HIM, WHERE THEY'LL GO TO AT&T PARK. THEY'LL CATCH PENGUIN, FREE LOU SEAL, SAVE THE CITY. CHIEF WILL SEND ONE LAST MESSAGE-- WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THE JUMBOTRON. --CONGRATULATING BATKID AND TELLING HIM TO COME DOWN TO CITY HALL, WHERE THE MAYOR HAS A SPECIAL PRESENTATION AND WILL GIVE HIM THE KEY TO THE CITY. THIS IS SUCH A FUN IDEA. AND IT'S A HUGE IDEA! AND HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT WORK? [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] IF HE CAN CLOSE THEM. THE PENGUIN IS ACTUALLY CALLING ON THE LINE. Jutan: WE'D GONE TO AT&T PARK A COUPLE OF TIMES-- EJ AND I-- TO SCOPE OUT THE AREA. AND I'D ASSUMED, GETTING THERE, THAT PATRICIA OR AT&T PARK WOULD SAY, "OKAY, SO WE WANT YOU TO DO THIS AND THEN GO OVER HERE, AND THEN LEAD MILES THIS WAY." AND, WE WERE JUST KINDA THERE TO CHAT ABOUT IT. SORT OF ALLOWED EJ AND I TO KIND OF FALL BACK TO OUR COLLABORATIVE NATURE, AND SAY, "OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS REALLY COOL. LIKE, WE COULD START HERE ON THE FAKE STREETCAR AND BATMAN AND BATKID CAN CHASE PENGUIN THROUGH HERE, AND THEN MAYBE I'LL JUMP OUT HERE AND RING THE BELL WITH MY UMBRELLA." THERE'S THIS BIG GUST OF WIND AS EJ'S CAPE JUST STARTS FLAPPIN' IN THE WIND. I WAS LIKE, "OH! LOOKS SO CINEMATIC." SO I WHIP OUT MY iPHONE. CERTAINLY GOTTA TAKE THAT PHOTO FOR MYSELF. MESSAGE IT TO MY MOM AFTER I LEAVE. SAY, "THIS IS WHY I'M NOT AT WORK TODAY." ONCE WE HAD DONE A REHEARSAL, WE SENT AN EMAIL TO OUR VOLUNTEERS TO INDICATE HOW MANY PEOPLE WE WANTED AT EACH LOCATION. MAYBE LIKE TWENTY PEOPLE HERE. AND THEN, TWO HUNDRED AT THE END. IT WAS THE WHOLE LAYOUT FOR THE DAY, SO THAT WAS PICKED UP BY ONE OF OUR VOLUNTEERS, WHO SAID, "THIS IS, LIKE, THE COOLEST WISH EVER" AND CUT AND PASTE THAT, AND PUT IN TO HIS FACEBOOK STATUS. Jutan: I KNEW THAT SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON FACEBOOK WOULD FINALLY PAY OFF. AND ONE OF THE TOOLS IN MY TOOLBOX IS CONSTANTLY BLABBING EVERYWHERE ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING. MY MOM WOULD SAY, "DON'T SHOW OFF." AND, UH, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU COULD SAY, LEADING BY EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW. UM, I ASSUMED THAT MAKE-A-WISH COULD USE A LOT MORE VOLUNTEERS, AND BY TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT IT AND BEING VERY OPEN ABOUT HOW FUN THIS IS, AND HOW EXCITING IT IS AND HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING THAT I MIGHT INSPIRE SOME OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE PART. YEAH, I-I'VE HEARD THE THEORY IS THAT THAT STARTED THE BALL ROLLING, WHICH IS CRAZY. Patricia: WE SAW IT BLOGGED AND THOUGHT, "OH, LOOK AT THAT." UM, THEN I STARTED SEEING IT IN TWITTER, AND PEOPLE POSTING IT TO MY OWN FACEBOOK PAGE, LIKE: "DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?" LIKE, YE-- YEAH, I KNOW ABOUT IT. THIS IS MY WISH. AND IT JUST, IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE WILDFIRE. AND IT JUST, HUGE, JUST, LIKE, IT EXPLODED. Suhr: WE DO STUFF WITH MAKE-A-WISH ALL THE TIME. THIS WAS GONNA BE NO DIFFERENT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S IN A BLOG ON ONE DAY, WHICH BECOMES ANOTHER DAY, WHICH BECOMES A PHONE CALL FROM THE EAST COAST, WHICH BECOMES A PHONE CALL FROM NORWAY, WHICH BECOMES A RADIO CALL FROM AUSTRALIA, WHICH HAS A T-SHIRT CAMPAIGN, AND EVERYBODY WONDERING, "WHAT CAN I DO?" Mayor Lee: THE CHIEF WAS SAYING, "UH, MAYOR? I-I THINK SOMETHING IS GROWING HERE WITH THIS-WITH THIS MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION, WITH, UH, MILES." Pomponi: I WAS ON REDDIT ONE NIGHT. THERE WAS A LITTLE BLURB ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BECOMING GOTHAM FOR A DAY FOR THIS LITTLE BOY WHO, UM, HAD CANCER. AND SOMETHING ABOUT THAT JUST REALLY STRUCK A NERVE. AND I REACHED OUT TO THEM, AND JUST SAID, "YOU KNOW, WE ARE A SAN FRANCISCO-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA AGENCY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOCIAL MEDIA PLAN, WE'D LOVE TO PUT ONE TOGETHER FOR YOU." TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AFTER THAT, WE PRESENTED THEM WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLAN FOR #SFBatKid OUR GOAL, ACTUALLY, WAS TO GET THE LOCAL COMMUNITY EXCITED AND TO SHOW UP AND SUPPORT MILES. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS A CROWD AROUND HIM JUST CHEERING HIM ON. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN INFLUENCERS WHO BLOG, WHO ARE ON INSTAGRAM, ON TWITTER, ON FACEBOOK, PINTEREST, AND, REALLY ANY SOCIAL CHANNEL WHERE WOMEN ARE INFLUENTIAL. Patricia: I'M TALKING TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE, AND THEY'RE ASKING ME HOW MANY PEOPLE I THINK ARE COMING, AND I SAID, "I HAVE NO IDEA." LIKE, HOW DO I GET A SENSE? I PUT UP AN RSVP FORM ON OUR WEBSITE, AND WE STARTED TWEETING AND PUTTING ON FACEBOOK STATUS, ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO RSVP SO WE'D HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE COMING. WE WERE ADDING, MAYBE, A THOUSAND PEOPLE OVERNIGHT, AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR SO RSVPS HAPPENING EVERY NIGHT. Suhr: AND THEN, KIND OF THE NEXT PIECE WAS, THEY SAID THAT THEY GOT SEVEN THOUSAND RESERVATIONS FOR LUNCH AT THE BURGER BAR, WHICH WAS IN THE ARTICLE AS PART OF THE ITINERARY. AND-AND THAT WAS A GAME CHANGER. WE KNEW, UH, WE HAD A TIGER BY THE TAIL. Mayor Lee: THERE WERE PREDICTIONS THAT WE'D HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE AT CITY HALL. MAKE-A-WISH, THIS IS JEN. Jennifer: I'M USUALLY TRYING TO PITCH STORIES AND COME UP WITH A LOCAL ANGLE FOR A LOCAL PAPER OR PLAY UP ONE ASPECT OF THE WISH THAT MIGHT, I THINK, APPEAL TO THE PRESS. UM, AND IN THIS CASE. YEAH, WE HADN'T EVEN REALLY DONE A PRESS RELEASE FOR THIS WISH. Cooper: THERE WAS A LOT OF FERVOR ONLINE. A LOT OF COMMENTS. PEOPLE REALLY STARTED, LIKE, TALKING ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S BIG IN THE NEWSROOM WHEN THE JOURNALISTS ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER ABOUT IT. LIKE, THEIR WATER-COOLER TALK IS ABOUT THE NEWS STORY. MY FRIENDS STARTED POSTING IT ON FACEBOOK, AND ONE OF THEM MESSAGED ME AND SAID, "SO IS GOTHAM CITY'S 'CHRONICLE' GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO ABOUT THIS?" AND I THOUGHT, "YES! WE DEFINITELY SHOULD." Taylor: IT'S INTERESTING BEING A JOURNALIST. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE THIS DESIRE TO COVER THINGS IN A VERY NEUTRAL WAY, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU REALLY WANNA USE YOUR MEGAPHONE FOR GOOD. UM, THIS WAS DEFINITELY A CASE OF THE LATTER. I WROTE A STORY ABOUT IT. THE HEADLINE WAS SEVEN THOUSAND STRANGERS COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE, YOU KNOW, ONE KID'S WISH COME TRUE. BY THE NEXT DAY, I HAD TO CHANGE THAT HEADLINE TO TEN THOUSAND STRANGERS. THAT STORY, I THINK, GOT SHARED ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND TIMES. Cooper: AT SOME POINT, WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEWS, AND THEY BECAME MORE AND MORE EXCITED, AND MORE AND MORE AGGRESSIVE. Jennifer: INSTEAD OF US, KIND OF, YEAH, CHASING THEM DOWN, IT WAS THEM TRYING TO CHASE US DOWN. Patricia: SHE WALKED IN AND SHUT MY DOOR ONE DAY, AND I SAID, "OH, DEAR GOD, NOW WHAT?" AND SHE SAID, "THERE'S TV CAMERAS DOWNSTAIRS IN THE LOBBY. THEY WON'T LEAVE UNTIL YOU COME DOWN." CNN CALLING MY HOME. Woman: PATRICIA WILSON IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CHAPTER OF MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION. SO, PATRICIA, YOU ASKED VOLUNTEERS TO HELP MILES' WISH COME TRUE. GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN LIKE. Patricia: YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE THE RESPONSE THAT WE'RE GETTING. AND IT WARMS MY HEART HOW COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE ARE. AND THE CALLS COMING FROM ALL OVER. THE STORY'S BIG IN NORWAY RIGHT NOW, APPARENTLY. AND WE HAVE PEOPLE FLYING IN FOR THIS, TO EXPERIENCE THIS, SO IT IS... WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PEOPLE ARE FLYING INTO SAN FRANCISCO? YES. ♪ THIS IS A NEW BEGINNING ♪ I WAS ON TWITTER SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE MORNING. I WAS A FEW BLOCKS FROM MY HOME AND I HEARD AN NPR REPORT. Van Auken: WE HEARD ON THE RADIO THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WANTING VOLUNTEERS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FOR A FLASH MOB. WHEN I SAW THAT FACE, I'M LIKE, "I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT." IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS A BIG MAGNET PULLING ME. SO I BOOKED THE TICKET, LIKE THAT NEXT DAY. SO ABOUT FORTY MINUTES LATER, WE HAD PURCHASED OUR TICKETS. Van Auken: WE'RE BOTH RETIRED. WE JUST HAD TO FIND SOMEBODY TO STAY WITH THE DOGS. Patricia: THE NEXT WAVE OF JUST SEEING SO MANY PEOPLE WHO PHYSICALLY WANTED TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO, IT WAS SCARY. W-W-WHY ARE THEY COMING? THINKING ABOUT THAT MANY PEOPLE IN ONE SPOT, AND THAT I'M TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE AN EVENT. WILL IT MEET THEIR EXPECTATIONS? WILL EVERYONE BE SAFE? Suhr: WE ONLY HAVE WHAT WE HAVE ON A GIVEN DAY, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE A BIG CITY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE AN ANOMALY, YOU NEED TO HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN THAT'S SCALABLE, BASED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE COME. AND IN THIS INSTANCE WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. IS THIS REALLY WHAT MILES AND HIS FAMILY WOULD WANT? IS IT RIGHT FOR THE FAMILY? Natalie: WE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT. WE WENT TO IDAHO. OUT OF CELL PHONE SERVICE. OUR PHONES JUST STARTED BLOWING UP ON THE WAY HOME. NICK'S AUNT CALLED AND SAID THAT THERE WAS A ARTICLE IN THE "HUFFINGTON" NEWSPAPER DOWN IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND..."HUFFINGTON POST," I THINK IT IS? WHERE DID I GO FOR A WEEK? YOU KNOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S... THE WORLD'S UPSIDE DOWN. WHAT DID WE-WHAT DID WE GET OURSELVES INTO? Natalie: AND I STARTED GETTING EMAILS FROM PATRICIA. "WELL, THERE'S GONNA BE ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE." AND WE'RE LIKE, "WHAT?" WE WERE JUST ALL-JUST KIND OF TERRIFIED, LIKE... AND THEN LIKE, THE NEXT WEEK, "OH, WELL, ACTUALLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND." ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP, AND OUR SON IS SO SHY. Natalie: HE'S NOT USED TO BEING AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE, 'CAUSE HE'S NOT-- I MEAN, HE GOES TO SCHOOL, BUT, IF SOMEONE WERE TO ASK HIM TO DO SOMETHING IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, HE-HE GETS EMBARRASSED. Nick: THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE COMING AND THEY'RE GONNA BE REALLY DISAPPOINTED, 'CAUSE HE'S GONNA SEE THAT AND BOLT. Natalie: PATRICIA'S LIKE, "OH, WE'LL JUST WING IT. YOU KNOW, IF SOMETHIN' HAPPENS, THEN WE'LL JUST KINDA PLAY OFF OF IT. AND IT'LL BE FINE." SO SHE JUST KINDA NIPPED THAT RIGHT IN THE BUNS. TWO WEEKS OUT WAS JUST PANIC. IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL. NO ONE WAS SLEEPING. I JUST SOBBED ON MY BIKE RIDE TO WORK EVERY DAY. Patricia: SHEER ADRENALINE IS W-HOW WE SURVIVED. Pomponi: WE NORMALLY TAKE THREE WEEKS TO PLAN AND BUILD UP TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE GONNA START KIND OF, THREE WEEKS LATER. WE STARTED JUST ASSIGNING PEOPLE. LIKE, "YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE GIFTS THAT ARE COMING IN." "YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF FIELDING REQUESTS FOR MORE BATMOBILES." I-I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY, FOURTEEN CARS, INCLUDING LAMBORGHINI OFFERING CARS. AND I WAS LIKE, "WE'RE SET. WE'RE ALL GOOD." IT WAS UNNERVING TO THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE WERE COMING AND-AND THAT WE WERE GONNA BE UNDER A MICROSCOPE. Jutan: IT WAS NOT LOST ON ME AT ALL THAT THEY WERE ENTRUSTING US WITH SOMETHING HUGELY IMPORTANT. IT JUST SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD SEE THIS. AND THEN, PEOPLE WOULD THEN WANNA VOLUNTEER MORE. AND THAT MORE KIDS WOULD BE REFERRED. AND THEY COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE WISHES. EJ: IT'S LIKE WE'RE ORGANIZING A STAGE PRODUCTION THAT'S HUGE, WHERE THE LEAD CHARACTER DOESN'T KNOW HE'S IN IT, HAS NEVER BEEN TO A REHEARSAL AND IS FIVE. RIGHT. SO WHAT COULD GO WRONG? THERE WAS A LOT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT. WELL, HIS STORY HAS GONE VIRAL WITH FOLKS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD CHEERING HIM ON. Jennifer: A WEEK BEFORE THE WISH, WHEN WE REALIZED THAT WE WERE OUT OF OUR LEAGUE, IN TERMS OF MEDIA AND THE DEMANDS OF THE SOCIALLY VIRAL STORY, HOW FORTUNATE WERE WE THAT WE JUST HAD A NEW BOARD MEMBER JOIN THAT WAS THE, YOU KNOW, TOP CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS PERSON AT APPLE? Cotton: I'VE DONE BIG EVENTS. AND I'VE DONE PR. AND I'VE DONE FOR NONPROFIT AND MANY DIFFERENT STARTUPS AND MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND SO I'M USED TO THAT. I-I ALSO MANAGE CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS, AND SO-- NOT THAT IT WAS A CRISIS. IT WAS CERTAINLY A BIT OF CHAOS. AND SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID, "I'M GONNA PUT A-- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY TEAM FOR THE WEEK." AND SO, OF COURSE, WE ALL WANTED TO BURST INTO TEARS WE WERE SO RELIEVED. SOMEWHERE IN THERE, TWITTER CALLED ME. I THINK I FOUND IT ON TWITTER. AND I SWEAR I STARTED TEARING UP AFTER READING MILES'S STORY. IMMEDIATELY REACHED OUT TO PATRICIA. "OH, I WORK FOR TWITTER, SO I WORK IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA SPACE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO ON MY OWN TO SUPPORT THIS DAY AND TO USE THE SKILLS THAT I HAVE?" WHICH IS BASICALLY A PASSION FOR-FOR TWEETING AND-AND AND CREATING CONTENT IN A HUNDRED AND FORTY CHARACTERS. UM, AND SHE STOPPED ME RIGHT THERE, AND SHE SAID, "WE DON'T DO A GREAT JOB AT TWITTER." UM, "WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OVER THE AT-SFWISH TWITTER HANDLE FOR THE DAY? RIDE ON THE CARAVAN AND JUST DOCUMENT THE DAY AND PUSH OUT UPDATES ON TWITTER?" I'VE ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA THAT I WANTED TO TWEET A WISH IN REAL-TIME. AND THIS WISH WOULD REALLY LEND ITSELF TO IT BECAUSE I HAD ALL THE VIDEO IN THE CAN ALREADY. SO THAT PEOPLE COULD SEE IT IN REAL-TIME AS MILES WAS SEEING IT. IT SOUNDS GREAT. SIGN ME UP. AND I THOUGHT THAT IF I DID IT THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, FEWER PEOPLE WOULD FEEL THE NEED TO PHYSICALLY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO. AND THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THE CITY. De Jesus: I TOLD MY TEAM, YOU'RE ALL TAKING THE AFTERNOON OFF ON THAT DAY, AND YOU'RE GOING TO CITY HALL. AND YOU'RE GOING TO SUPPORT THIS KID. I MEAN ADAM WEST CALLED. HANS ZIMMER, THE COMPOSER, CALLED. HI, MILES. I THOUGHT I'LL WRITE A LITTLE TRACK FOR YOU. HERE WE GO. WE'D BEEN WORKING ON AND OFF ON OUR BATMAN TRILOGY FOR ABOUT NINE YEARS BY THIS POINT. HOW DID I GET TO BATMAN? BECAUSE I WAS A FAN AS A KID. WHY IT RESONATED WITH ME PERSONALLY WAS BECAUSE HERE WAS A KID WHO SAW BEYOND THE CONFINES OF WHATEVER THE POSSIBILITIES WAS. HERE WAS A KID WHO HAD A DREAM, AND HE WAS GOING, "OKAY, I WANT TO HAVE THIS DREAM HAPPEN." I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT, "IF HE WANTS TO GO AND CREATE THIS WORLD, WE SHOULD GO AND SUPPORT THIS WORLD." THE PART YOU GUYS ARE MISSING IS YOU'RE MISSING THE SCORE. SO LET ME JUST-- LET ME JUST GO AND FILL IN THE GAP HERE. I FELT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO. JUST SHOOT IT ON AN iPHONE AS OPPOSED TO DO A BIG PRODUCTION. THE WHOLE THING WAS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, "HEY, LET'S JUST GET TOGETHER AND JUST LET'S DO THIS. LET'S JUST JAM." IN A WEIRD WAY, WHAT MILES DID, OF COURSE, BY SAYING "I WANT THIS. I-I WANT TO BE THIS" HE GOT A WHOLE CITY TO SORT OF JAM, AND THAT'S A- THAT'S A VERY NATURAL THING THAT HAPPENS TO MUSICIANS. AND I THOUGHT, "YEAH, IF YOU POINT YOUR BAT-CALL SIGNAL UP INTO THE SKY, I'LL BE THERE." AND THERE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PERSONALIZED BAT-CALL. HOPE YOU LIKE IT. WE'D LAUGH AND SAY, "WHO'S GONNA CALL NEXT? WHAT, THE PRESIDENT?" Natalie: WE DIDN'T TELL HIM ANYTHING ABOUT THE WISH. ALL WE TOLD HIM WAS THAT, WE'RE GONNA GO TO SAN FRANCISCO AND YOU MIGHT BE GETTING A NEW COSTUME. 'CAUSE THAT'S THE MAIN THING. WHEN HE WANTS TO DRESS UP OR DO SOMETHING, IT'S, LIKE, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE COSTUME. AND IF IT'S NOT PERFECT, THEN IT'S A BIG ISSUE. THE BATKID ARMOR WAS ACTUALLY BUILT BY A DAD FOR HIS OWN KID. John: YOU TAKE A STEP INSIDE OF IT LIKE THAT. James: WE MADE A HALLOWEEN COSTUME IN OUR FRONT YARD. IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO MAKE IT. MY DAD, UM, WENT ON FACEBOOK. John: MY FRIEND TARA POSTED A LINK TO THE UPCOMING BATKID THING, AND WE REALLY GOT MOVED BY THE STORY. I-I ASKED JAMES IF WE COULD JUST LET HIM BORROW IT. AND I KIND OF EXPLAIN CANCER AND WHAT IT DOES AND, UM, HE KINDA JUST SAID, AT THAT POINT, THAT HE CAN KEEP IT. I'M JUST HAPPY THAT MILES HAS IT NOW. Patricia: THE ADULT COSTUME WAS A BIT TRICKIER. EJ: WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE COSTUMES, AND WE JUST COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET A GOOD-LOOKING COSTUME. I SAID, "WELL, IT'S OKAY. PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA BE LOOKIN' AT ME. THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKIN' AT MILES." AND SUE SAID, "HE'S GONNA BE LOOKING AT YOU." AND I WENT, "OH. YEAH, WE GOTTA FIX THE COSTUME." WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD FRIENDS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO OPERA. AND THEY SAID, "PROJECT SOUNDS REALLY FUN. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO, LET ME KNOW." AND SO WE DID. Verdosci: SO WHAT I NEXT DID WAS DID SOME RESEARCH. UM, NOT THAT I HAD TO DO TOO MUCH, BECAUSE, UH, I OWN EVERY BATMAN ARKHAM VIDEO GAME EVER CREATED. UH, AND I-AND I GREW UP ON THE ADAM WEST SHOW. SO IT WAS REALLY FUN TO SORT OF DO THE RESEARCH AS FAR AS WHAT THEIR LOOK WAS IN THE SIXTIES, VERSUS WHAT THEIR LOOK WAS IN THE NINETIES, VERSUS WHAT THEIR MODERN LOOK WAS. THE BATMAN COSTUME ITSELF IS-IS A LITTLE MORE THE MODERN VERSION. HE PURCHASED THE COSTUME. THE DELUXE, EXPENSIVE VERSION. AND IT NEEDED A LOTTA WORK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT WE REALLY ENDED UP USING WAS THE HOOD, THE BREASTPLATE, AND THE GAUNTLETS. THE, SORT OF, BREASTPLATE WAS A MOLDED LATEX BREASTPLATE. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SORT OF MOLDED IN, "THIS WILL FIT THIS SIZE TO THIS SIZE." AND SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS IT JUST-IT WAS A LITTLE OVERSIZED. IT HAD THESE MOLDED PECTORALS THAT WERE COLLAPSING. PADDED IT OUT. WE ALTERED IT. WE MADE IT FIT HIM PERFECTLY. THE PENGUIN WAS EASY. "I'M GONNA BRING OUT A SET OF MONOCLES." HE'S LIKE, "NOW DON'T LOSE THIS 'CAUSE THE OPERA HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONOCLES." I MEAN, THE PENGUIN IS IN AN OPERA COSTUME. SO I WAS LIKE, "OKAY. I THINK I LIKE THIS ONE. AND I WAS TRYING TO GET IT IN AND IT KEPT POPPING OUT." Verdosci: THE PENGUIN'S IN A TAIL SUIT, WITH GRAY-STRIPED TROUSERS AND SPATS. I'VE PROBABLY GOT THREE HUNDRED OF THOSE DOWNSTAIRS. Jutan: THIS CRAZY TUXEDO THAT SOMEBODY'S WORN ON SOME "CARMINA BURANA" THING OR SOMETHING. [ OPERA MUSIC PLAYING ] THE RIDDLER WAS A LOT TRICKIER. I HAD STEERED THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF A REALLY CRAZY LIME GREEN SATIN SUIT THAT WE COULD BUY. AND MY THEORY WAS, "OH, WE'LL JUST PRINT THE QUESTION MARKS ON IT. IT'LL BE SO FAST." WELL, THAT HOUR OF PRINTING QUESTION MARKS TURNED INTO TWO DAYS. THEY HAD SOME MASSIVE OPERA SHOW I THINK, THE WEEK OF. AND SO THEY WERE SUPER BUSY. Verdosci: WE WERE OPENING AND PERFORMING THREE TO FOUR DIFFERENT PRODUCTIONS. BECAUSE WE PERFORM IN REP, IT'S A DIFFERENT PRODUCTION EACH NIGHT. EJ: DURING THEIR BUSIEST SEASON THEY PULLED ALL-NIGHTERS TO GET OUR STUFF TOGETHER. Verdosci: THOSE OF US THAT WORKED ON THIS DID THIS ON OUR OWN TIME, AFTER WORK, IN THE EVENINGS. THERE WAS NO WAY WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS. I ALMOST PUT MORE EFFORT INTO IT BECAUSE IT WAS GONNA BE SUCH A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR MILES. WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH EMOTION AS WELL, IT KIND OF TAKES OVER AND YOU REALIZE HOW PERFECT YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO BE. AND HONESTLY, MY EXPECTATION WAS, "GREAT. DONE. MOVING ON TO THE REP. UH, I'LL PROBABLY NEVER EVEN HEAR ABOUT THIS." EJ: SO TWO DAYS BEFORE THE EVENT, I BROKE THE PROJECTOR. THE PROJECTOR, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, THE SHOOT-THE-MESSAGES- FROM-MY-ARM-OUT-ONTO-THE-WALL. THE LITTLE COMPUTER THAT RUNS THE THING JUST STOPPED WORKING. LIKE, STOPPED WORKING IRRECOVERABLY. MILES WILL NEVER KNOW THAT IT WAS MISSING, RIGHT? WE'LL HAVE A PHONE AND WE'LL SEE THE POLICE CHIEF'S MESSAGE. AND MY WHOLE LIFE, I WILL KNOW THAT I COULD'VE MADE IT BETTER. I PLACED A NEW ORDER. ON A WHIM, I SENT AN EMAIL LATE AT NIGHT TO THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE LITTLE COMPUTER I HAD FRIED. "WE'RE DOING THIS BATMAN PROJECT FOR MAKE-A-WISH. AND IF YOU COULD SHIP IT NEXT DAY, THAT'D BE GREAT." AND IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK. THE CEO OF GUMSTIX, THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THIS LITTLE COMPUTER CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY AND HE SAID: "I'M HAVING ONE COURIERED OUT TO YOU TODAY. I THINK THE PROJECT SOUNDS GREAT. IT SOUNDS REALLY COOL. HERE. TAKE THIS ONE AND SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK." TESTING, TEST. TESTING. TESTING. Man: SO, WHAT-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO? GONNA BE BATMAN. Daetz: I MET HIM, ACTUALLY, THE NIGHT BEFORE AND I DID AN INTERVIEW JUST AS A PREVIEW STORY TO AIR ON OUR AIR SO PEOPLE COULD SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO BE HAPPENING THE NEXT DAY. Daetz: YOUR WISH WAS TO BE BATMAN? YEAH. WHY DO YOU LIKE BATMAN SO MUCH? BECAUSE HE'S MY FAVORITE SUPERHERO. Daetz: VERY QUIET, VERY-- KIND OF SHY. YOU KNOW, TALKS TO DAD. Nick: HI, MILES. HI, MIL-- DAD. ARE YOU ON YOUR MAKE-A-WISH TRIP? YEAH. COOL. WHAT DO YOU THINK? UH...GO EAT DINNER. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? UH-HUH. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? UH-HUH. THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON. AW. WHAT ABOUT CLAYTON? YOGURT. LOOK HOW PRETTY MOMMY LOOKS. MOMMY. Clovicko: YOU WANNA SHOW EVERYBODY ELSE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE? THIS IS JUST SOME INFORMATION ABOUT-- Natalie: WOW. WHOA. ARE YOU GONNA READ IT ALL TO US, BUDDY? THAT WAS JUST-- Natalie: WHAT DO YOU HAVE, MILES? BATMAN? OH, I THINK CLAYTON LIKES YOUR BATMAN. BATMAN? OH, I THINK CLAYTON LIKES YOUR BATMAN. CLAYTON, WHAT DO YOU GOT? BA-BA. Man: HOW'S THINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO SO FAR? Nick: HECTIC. BUSY. BUSY. BUSY SCHEDULE. Jennifer: THE FAMILY WAS ARRIVING IN TOWN AND THE MEDIA FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. Natalie: WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TODAY, MILES? UM, PLAY. THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR STATION THAT WAS REALLY DESPERATE TO GET B-ROLL FOOTAGE OF THE FAMILY. THE REPORTER SAID, "DON'T MAKE ME CHASE THEM AND I'LL SPEND THE NEXT TWO DAYS TRYING TO FIND THEM." AND WHEN I HEARD THAT, IT REALLY SENT CHILLS THROUGH ME. THIS WAS A LITTLE FAMILY THAT WAS COMING HERE FOR THEIR WISH, AND YET THERE WAS THIS POTENTIAL FOR THEM TO BE HOUNDED BY THE MEDIA IN A WAY THAT WOULD NOT ONLY SPOIL THE WISH, BUT WOULD JUST BE AN ABSOLUTELY SORT OF TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE. ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHILD. HEY, I MEAN THAT ONE. YOU THINK BATMAN LIVES IN THAT ONE? YEAH. AND SO I KNEW THAT WE HAD TO REALLY BE CAREFUL. ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO GO TO THE CIRCUS CENTER AND DO TRICKS? CAN DO SOME TRAINING TONIGHT. OH, TODAY IS THE CIRCUS CEN-- CENTER. NO? IT IS. ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT, OR ARE YOU TOO TIRED? YOU GOTTA GO TRAIN TO BE BATMAN. SINCE WE HAVE THIS CIRCUS SCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT'S GREAT, I ASKED THEM, "CAN WE DO HIS BATMAN TRAINING THE DAY BEFORE THE EVENT?" THEY SAID, "ABSOLUTELY, YES." WHAT WE'VE GOT IS PENGUIN'S OBSTACLE COURSE. WHAT HE HAS DONE IS TO RIG THE BALLPARK SO THAT THE FLOOR IS ELECTRIFIED AND IF BATMAN AND BATKID TOUCH THE FLOOR, THEY'LL GET ELECTRIFIED FOR SURE. AND THEY DON'T WANT THAT. SO... ALL OF THIS BEHIND US IS GOING TO BE WHAT THE PENGUIN HAS PUT OUT TO GIVE BATKID THE CHALLENGE OF HIS LIFE. SO I THOUGHT, "WELL, IF HE'S GOING TO GET SUPERHERO TRAINING, SHOULDN'T MILES BE TRAINING WITH OTHER SUPERHEROES?" EJ: ALL OF THE ACROBATS WHO NORMALLY TRAIN THERE ON THURSDAYS CAME IN DRESSED AS SUPERHEROES. Kendall: COSTUMES ON HAIGHT, THE COSTUME SHOP DOWN THE STREET, UH, VERY GENEROUSLY LOANED US THE COSTUMES FOR FREE. EJ: THEY WERE RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME. Kendall: RIGHT AS HE CAME IN THE DOOR, THE FLASH JUST SORT OF WALKED BY, YOU KNOW, VERY CASUALLY INTO THE MAIN GYM. AND HE STARED AND HE LOOKED UP AT HIS MOM AND HE SAID, "THAT WAS THE FLASH." HE WAS JUST LIKE, BESIDE HIMSELF. Kendall: 'CAUSE WE WANTED HIM TO JUST SORT OF FEEL LIKE, WELL, THIS IS JUST NORMAL, RIGHT? THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS HERE. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE REGULAR PEOPLE GET TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO BE SUPERHEROES. UM, AND SO WE HAD OTHER PEOPLE JUST WALKING AROUND IN REGULAR CLOTHES, RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY, DOING THEIR REGULAR TRAINING. HE WASN'T DRESSED IN SUPERHERO CLOTHES YET, EJ WAS NOT IN SUPERHERO CLOTHES YET, BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS PART OF HOW YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN, IS THAT DREAMS COME TRUE SOMETIMES WITH A LOT OF HARD WORK. EJ: SO WE WERE GONNA TRY AND TEACH HIM SOME SUPERHERO MOVES, TEACH HIM TO FALL, AND SOME STUNTS. HE WOULD MAKE THE "HIYAH!" SOUND AS HE WAS JUMPING DOWN. I MEAN, HE WAS VERY MUCH INTO CONNECTING IT WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WAS FIGHTING CRIME. EJ: TO KIND OF GET HIM COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF ACTUALLY BEING BATMAN, WE SET UP AN OBSTACLE COURSE AND THEN EVERYTHING THAT HE LIKED, WE TRANSPLANTED THE NEXT DAY TO THE BALLPARK SO THAT WHEN HE GOT THERE AND THE PENGUIN IS SCARY AND THERE'S FIRE AND THERE'S ALL THIS STUFF, THE PENGUIN'S EVIL TRAP IS FAMILIAR. WHILE WE WERE GIVING HIM HIS BATMAN ACROBAT LESSON, HE AND I GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WAY BETTER. WE HADN'T REALLY MET FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE THAT. DURING THAT EVENT, I SHOWED HIM THE SECRET ACROBAT HANDSHAKE. THERE ACTUALLY IS A SECRET ACROBAT HANDSHAKE. YOU KIND OF GRASP FOREARMS LIKE THAT, BECAUSE IN FLYING TRAPEZE AND OTHER ACROBATIC DISCIPLINES, THAT'S HOW YOU HANG ON TO SOMEONE WITHOUT LOSING 'EM. THEY DIDN'T TELL HIM I WAS GOING TO BE BATMAN THE NEXT DAY. Kendall: AND BECAUSE HE HAD SUCH GREAT ENERGY, AND IT WAS GOING SO WELL, AT THE END OF THE NIGHT WE THOUGHT, "WELL, LET'S SEE IF HE WANTS TO FLY. YOU KNOW, HE'S A SUPERHERO. A LOT OF THEM FLY, RIGHT?" AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS LITTLE KID CLIMBS THAT LADDER UP TO THAT BOARD... Natalie: I JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT 'CAUSE I'M REALLY SCARED OF HEIGHTS. I DON'T LIKE FLYING, I DON'T LIKE THE FERRIS WHEEL. Kendall: ...TOOK A HOLD OF THAT WHITE BAR AND TOOK A SWING ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE. [ APPLAUSE ] Woman: NOW, THAT'S A SUPERHERO, RIGHT THERE. Man: ALL RIGHT! EJ: THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRETTY GOOD MAKE-A-WISH DAY. I KNOW IF-IF NONE OF THE REST OF IT HAD GONE AS PLANNED, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS AT THAT POINT. Miles: WHAT? WHAT, A-WHAT? Nick: WHAT DO YOU THINK, BUD? GO EAT LUNCH? Nick: AT NINE O'CLOCK WE WERE TOLD TO PUT IN THE DVD OF THE WHOLE NEWSCAST THING. GO EAT LUNCH. YOU WANNA GO EAT LUNCH? GO EAT LUNCH. YOU WANNA GO EAT LUNCH? YOU KNOW, NATALIE AND I ARE SITTIN' THERE AND WATCHING OUR WATCHES. OKAY, NOW WE'VE GOT TO PUT IT ON, AND WE SCREWED UP THE-- ENDED UP TURNING THE TV OFF, AND LIKE, OH. Reporter: ABC SEVEN NEWS STARTS RIGHT NOW WITH LIVE BREAKING NEWS. WHOA. MILES. Natalie: WHAT IS THIS? WHAT'S THIS? COME HERE. Natalie: WHAT IS THIS? WHAT'S THIS? COME HERE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE, I'M AMA DAETZ. OH, DID YOU MEET HER YESTERDAY? GOOD MORNING EVERYONE, I'M AMA DAETZ. OH, DID YOU MEET HER YESTERDAY? WE BEGIN THIS MORNING'S BROADCAST WITH BREAKING NEWS FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S HALL OF JUSTICE. YEAH. HI THERE. FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S HALL OF JUSTICE. YEAH. HI THERE. POLICE CHIEF GREG SUHR CALLED AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE HE ISSUED A VERY URGENT MESSAGE ASKING THAT ANYONE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAPED CRUSADER'S WHEREABOUTS TO PLEASE CONTACT SAN FRANCISCO'S HALL OF JUSTICE IMMEDIATELY. GOTHAM CITY NEEDS YOU, BATMAN. THIS IS POLICE CHIEF GREG SUHR, ONLY HOPING YOU CAN HEAR MY VOICE. IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU CALL ME RIGHT NOW. YES. WE HAVE A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS, YES. WE HAVE A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS, BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING, BATMAN. PLEASE, CAPED CRUSADER, WE NEED YOU. AND BRING THE BATKID! Daetz: IN OTHER NEWS, THE GOVERNOR SAID-- BATKID? THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP IMMEDIATELY ONCE IT WAS OVER, BUT THERE WAS LIKE A FIVE-MINUTE DELAY, AND WE'RE JUST LIKE, "DOOT DOOT DOO." Clayton: STOP! TELL COMMISSIONER GORDON. Clayton: STOP! TELL COMMISSIONER GORDON. COMMISSIONER GORDON? MM-HM. YOU GONNA GO TELL HIM? WELL, HOLD ON. WE'RE NOT READY TO GO YET. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, MILES? [ YELLING ] WHAT? AND THEN FINALLY SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] GOOD MORNING. THE POLICE CHIEF SAYS THERE'S TROUBLE. YOU'D BETTER GET DRESSED. WHOA. WE'VE GOT SOME ARMOR FOR YOU AND THERE'S QUITE AN ADVENTURE AHEAD. DID YOU PRACTICE? YEAH. DID YOU PRACTICE? YEAH. DID YOU PRACTICE SOME ACROBAT TRAINING YESTERDAY? YEAH. GOOD. YOU'LL NEED IT. AND YOUR ARMOR IS ON BACKWARDS. OR "BAT-WARDS," AS WE SAY. Patricia: AS SOON AS HE SAW THAT I MEAN, HE JUST STARTED STRIPPING DOWN. I GOT BATMAN SOCKS. YOU DO. I GOT BATMAN SOCKS. YOU DO. THAT'S FANTASTIC. Natalie: YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS SHIRT OFF? YOU'RE STARTING TO LOOK LIKE BATMAN. AS SOON AS WE PUT IT ALL ON HIM AND IT FIT. OH, YOU LOOK GREAT. YOU KNOW I'M A MOM, RIGHT? I CAN'T HELP IT. I LOOK AT IT AND THE CAPE IS WRINKLED. WELL, I CAN'T HAVE A WRINKLED BATMAN, SO I ASKED THE HYATT FOR A STEAMER. AND I'M STEAMING, AND... IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE ONCE HE PUT ON THE COSTUME, IT WAS LIKE, HE JUST DID THIS. HE'S-HE'S JUST LIKE... WOW. OH, MY GOD. I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU. WHERE IS MILES? AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND I SAID, "WHO ARE YOU?" AND HE SAID, "BATMAN." AND SO IT WAS LIKE, "YES!" THEN THEY DO THE HANDSHAKE. I SAID, YOU KNOW, "SECRET ACROBAT HANDSHAKE." HE DI-DID THAT, AND HE KIND OF WENT, "WAIT A MINUTE!" YOU COULD JUST SEE HIS EYES JUST, LIKE, LIGHT UP, AND-AND HE CLICKED, LIKE, "I KNOW YOU." SO HE JUST FOLLOWED EJ, AND HE'S GOT HIS STRUT ON AND-- Suhr: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, HE WAS A MINIATURE JOHN WAYNE. I MEAN, HE WALKS LIKE HE WEIGHS TWO-TWENTY. Nick: YES! YEAH. IT'S BATKID! Nick: NATALIE AND I ARE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE, "WHO IS THIS KID?" YOU KNOW. HE'S NOT OURS, 'CAUSE OURS WOULD BE LIKE, "HM-MM." Patricia: AS WE'RE BEING ESCORTED INTO THEIR LOADING DOCK, WHICH WAS THE BATCAVE, AND I CAN SEE THIS PICTURE OF BATKID NEXT TO HIS LITTLE BROTHER WHO WAS DRESSED AS ROBIN. AND IT WAS MAKING ME ALREADY CHOKE UP. IT WAS REALLY HAPPENING. [ APPLAUSE ] [ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ] Natalie: THERE GOES MILES... IN THE BATMOBILE. I'M LIKE, "OKAY, WELL, HE NEEDS A CAR SEAT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COPS AROUND, AND HE NEEDS A CAR SEAT." AND THEN I JUST MADE A BIG POINT TO EJ, LIKE, "JUST PLEASE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, THIS IS MY SON, THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE, DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF HIM." HE'S LIKE, "WELL, YEAH. OF COURSE." I MEAN, HE'S BATMAN. OF COURSE HE'D TAKE CARE OF BATKID. Patricia: I WALK UP OUT OF THE LOADING DOCK, THE BATCAVE, AND THAT WAS A MOMENT OF JUST SHEER... I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE. I MEAN, 'CAUSE THEN I HEAR THE HELICOPTERS OVER, AND THERE'S THREE NEWS HELICOPTERS. AND I SEE THE MASS OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AT A PLACE THAT I DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO BE. SO I CAN FEEL LIKE I CAN'T-- THERE'S NO AIR. I CAN'T BREATHE. AND I LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF POLICE AND THE WHOLE UNION SQUARE IS SHUT DOWN JUST TO SEE A LAMBORGHINI COME OUT OF A GARAGE. YOU KNOW, WOW. [ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ] Nick: ALL THESE PEOPLE AREN'T AT WORK TODAY. THEY TOOK OFF TO COME WATCH OUR SON PARADE AROUND TOWN. AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "THIS IS INSANE." THIS IS INSANE. Natalie: AND THEN ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, ARE, "OH, THIS IS INSANE." AND I'M LIKE, "WELL, I KNOW. PLEASE QUIT TELLING ME." Patricia: THAT WAS THE MOMENT KIND OF WHERE YOU JUST GO, "OH, BOY. THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG DAY. I JUST HOPE I SURVIVE IT, AND EVERYONE ELSE DOES, TOO." THERE'S NO WAY TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR WHIPPING THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO WITH A POLICE ESCORT IN A LAMBORGHINI FOLLOWING ANOTHER SUPERHERO WITH PEOPLE LINED UP ON THE SIDEWALKS IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD CHEERING. EVERY PERSON WE PASSED WAS SMILING, WAS HAPPY. EJ: IT MADE ME KIND OF DEEP-DOWN HAPPY. I REALIZED THAT NOBODY EVER GETS TO DO THIS. I JUST ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. YEAH. HE'S LIKE, "I HAVE TO RESCUE HER." Clovicko: WE HAD JUST REALLY ASKED FOR THE PARKING AND FOR ONE STREET TO BE SHUT DOWN. WE LEARNED THEN THAT THE COPS DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN ALL THE STREETS. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A PARADE ROUTE, BASICALLY. AND-AND THEY DID THAT BECAUSE OF PUBLIC SAFETY. THE COPS KEPT BEING LIKE, "WE NEED MORE YAMAHAS," AND THEY KEPT BRINGING IN MORE AND MORE OF THEIR MOTORCYCLES. Suhr: SO ALL THE MOTORCYCLE OFFICERS ARE CALLING ME, SAYING, "I'LL COME IN FOR FREE." AND THE GUYS THAT WERE THERE, WHEN WE SAID, "HEY, THERE IS NO OVERTIME"? "WE'RE GOOD, WE'LL JUST STAY." THE FEELING ON THE STREET WAS ELECTRIC. IT WAS ELECTRIC. IT WAS LIKE A REALLY NICE, LOVELY, COMMUNAL FEELING THAT, LIKE, I'VE NEVER FELT. IT WAS, LIKE, PALPABLE. Van Auken: YOU COULD FEEL THE ANTICIPATION IN THE AIR. WE ARE TOTALLY HERE TO SEE BATKID TODAY. BATKID! Woman: SAVING OUR BEAUTIFUL CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. BATKID! Woman: SAVING OUR BEAUTIFUL CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. Man: NO, GOTHAM. WE WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR THE WORLD. Man #2: WELL, BATKID, YOU'VE DONE IT TO ME. I-I'VE COME TO TURN MYSELF IN. WE NEED MORE SUPERHEROES. BATKID! All: BATKID! All: BATKID! Man #3: NICELY DONE, EVERYONE! OUR FIRST STOP AT THE CABLE CAR WAS KIND OF CHAOTIC. Taylor: I SEE THEM SITTING IN THE CAR, I'M LIKE, "OH, THIS ISN'T SO BAD. THERE'S A SMALL CROWD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET." THEN I REALIZE WE'RE ACTUALLY TWO OR THREE BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE THE CABLE CAR RESCUE IS GONNA HAPPEN. I TOOK A FEW PICTURES OF THAT. THAT WAS AS CLOSE AS I GOT TO HIM ALL DAY. Martel: BATKID HAD BEEN CALLED OUT TO HELP WHAT THEY WERE CALLING A "DAMSEL IN DISTRESS." THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS TIED TO A BOMB. Sue: I HAVE ADVICE FOR OTHER DAMSELS -- DON'T TRUST BATMAN TO BE ON TIME. SO YOU MIGHT WANNA HEAD TO THE LADIES' ROOM EVEN IF THEY TELL YOU HE'S GONNA BE THERE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES. I WAS ACTUALLY SITTING ON A BIT OF AN INCLINE, AND THE RIDDLER'S BOX WAS EMPTY SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO SUPPORT MYSELF WITH. SO I BASICALLY HAD TO HOLD MYSELF UP WITH MY QUADS FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES WHILE I WAITED FOR BATMAN. ALL THESE REPORTERS CAME UP AND CAME, LIKE, ABOUT TWO INCHES FROM MY FACE. AND THEY'RE LIKE, "ARE YOU SCARED?" AND I SAID, "WELL, I WASN'T BEFORE, BUT NOW I'M PRETTY TERRIFIED." Clovicko: AND THEN THE ONE TURNS TO ME AND HE WAS LIKE, "WELL, HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE?" AND I'M LIKE, "FOUR MINUTES, ONCE WE START IT. WHY ARE WE NOT STARTING IT?" AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE KIND OF WAITING ON YOU." SO THEN I REALIZED I HAD TO TELL THEM A LOT MORE. BECAUSE IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD. Martel: WE COULD LITERALLY SEE THE TRAIN COMING SLOWLY WITH THE IDEA THAT, IT'S AMAZING HOW BELIEVABLE THIS BECOMES WHEN YOU'RE STANDING THERE, THAT THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS GOING TO BE BLOWN UP. AND, OF COURSE, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS WELL. LOOK! LET'S GO! [ APPLAUSE ] EJ: I WOULD GET A POUNDING ON MY LEG, AND HE WOULD SAY, "CAN'T SEE. CAN'T SEE." HE HAD A LITTLE HOOD UNDER HIS BATMAN COWL AND THE LITTLE HOOD WOULD SLIP FORWARD LIKE THAT. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING YOU CAN'T PLAN FOR, RIGHT? HOW'S THAT? LET'S GO! YEAH! Natalie: I JUST REMEMBER THINKING, GOSH, THEY HAVE TO BE SO HOT IN THOSE SUITS. IT'S SO HOT." LOOK WHAT'S HERE. THERE'S A DAMSEL UP THERE. AND SEE THAT? DOES THAT LOOK FAMILIAR? THE TRAMPOLINE? I'M GONNA GO. YOU FOLLOW ME, OKAY? LET'S GO! EJ: I LOVED RESCUING SUE. SHE SO RARELY GETS INTO ACTUAL TROUBLE. ARE YOU OKAY, MA'AM? SHE LOOKED UP AT US WITH THE "PLEASE HELP ME" LOOK. WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS? AND THAT KICKED IN TO MY CORE. SHE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. PROBABLY THE RIDDLER. PULL THE WIRES OUT! IT MADE ME GO, "OH, WE HAVE TO-- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING." PULL THEM ALL OUT. GOOD JOB. PULL IT HARD. PULL. [ BELL DINGING ] AHH! I THINK WE'VE GOT IT. NOW TAKE HER MASK OFF. THANK YOU, BATKID. THANK YOU. CAN SOMEONE UNTIE ME? [ BELL DINGING ] THERE YOU GO, MA'AM. LET'S GO. BATKID! VERY GOOD. OH, THANK YOU. EJ: THE HUG THAT SHE GAVE MILES... THAT HUG WAS ON MY MAKE-A-WISH LIST FOR A LONG TIME. Man: HEY, BUD! MAN #5 IN CROWD KISS HER! MAN #6 IN CROWD HEY, BUDDY. I WAS TWEETING FROM MY PHONE FROM THE OFFICIAL HANDLE. I WAS TAKING PICTURES AND PUSHING OUT TWEETS. AND THE WAY HE'S WALKING AND THE WAY HE WAS SO EXCITED, I HAD TO TAKE A PICTURE. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] Taylor: AS SOON AS I SAW THAT ONE INSTAGRAM PHOTO THAT MAKE-A-WISH TWEETED OUT THAT JUST SAID "HERE HE COMES," WHICH BECAME THE MOST RETWEETED TWEET OF THE DAY, IT WENT INTERNATIONAL. AND MY PHONE BASICALLY DIED MANY TIMES DURING THE DAY BECAUSE I WAS GETTING ALL THESE NOTIFICATIONS. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ENGAGEMENTS AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE TWEETS. Patricia: THEY BROKE OUR WEBSITE, AND OUR WEBSITE WENT DOWN. WE HAD OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED HITS PER SECOND. WE COULDN'T GET A SIGNAL. CELL SERVICE WAS OUT. EVERYONE WAS TAKING PICTURES. De Jesus: YOU KNOW, I WAS GETTING TWEET RESPONSES FROM EGYPT, FROM THE PHILIPPINES. PRESIDENT OBAMA RETWEETED ONE OF MY TWEETS AND BASICALLY MADE MY LIFE. EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MY PERSONAL HANDLE. Taylor: YOU KNOW WHAT, AS SOON AS I SAW THAT, I KNEW THIS WAS A SOCIAL MEDIA PHENOMENON. Patricia: EVERY ACTOR WHO HAD EVER PLAYED BATMAN WAS TWEETING. Pomponi: THE POSTINGS THAT WERE FROM, LIKE, ALL OVER THE WORLD, WITH THE CUTE LITTLE SIGNS AND KIDS DRESSING UP, AND, LIKE, TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN, AND PEOPLE FROM AUSTRALIA. Sue: I HAD FRIENDS WHO WERE TRAVELING IN MOSCOW WHO WERE TEXTING ME, SAYING, "I'M SEEING ALL THESE NEWS REPORTS AND I THINK THIS IS YOU." De Jesus: HASHTAG SFBatKid WAS TRENDING. IT VERY MUCH WAS A GLOBALLY VIEWED EVENT. EVERYONE WAS WATCHING ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND EVERYONE WAS WAITING FOR THE NEXT TWEET, WHICH ADDED PRESSURE ON ME TO TWEET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WHEN I SHOWED UP TO THE INTERSECTION AT GREEN STREET, THERE WERE ABOUT SIX OF US THERE. AND SO I HAD MY JACKET AND MY iPHONE AND MY PURSE AND I JUST PUT THEM ON THE CORNER AN-AND I SAT DOWN. AND THEN ALL OF THESE PEOPLE STARTED COMING. AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY... KISS AWAY THE LEATHER JACKET AND THE iPHONE AND THE HANDBAG." BUT AFTER EVERYBODY LEFT, NOBODY TOUCHED MY STUFF. IT WAS REALLY, YOU KNOW, IT WAS THAT KIND OF DAY. NORMALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A CROWD AND YOU NEED TO KEEP A STREET OR KEEP AN AREA OR KEEP A DIGNITARY SAFE, IT'S ALL US. AND IT'S ALL PUSH AND PLEAD AND PROD, AND PEOPLE ARE MAD AT US. EVERY SINGLE TIME WE WOULD TELL THE PEOPLE, "HEY, LOOK, YOU'RE MAKING THE LITTLE GUY NERVOUS... CAN WE JUST GET A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM?" REGULAR CITIZENS WOULD JUST TURN AROUND AND SAY, "HEY, COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO HELP OUT" OR "WE'VE GOT TO BACK UP." WE WERE LIKE, "WOW, WE-WE'D TAKE THIS ALL DAY LONG IF WE COULD GET IT ANY OTHER DAY." DON'T PUSH ON THE TAPE. THERE'S A CALL COMING IN FROM THE COMMISS-- FROM THE POLICE CHIEF. HEY, BATKID. Women: GO BATMAN! WATCH! READY? DYNAMIC DUO, I'M AFRAID YOUR OLD NEMESIS THE RIDDLER IS IN TOWN WITH ENOUGH DYNAMITE TO BLOW THIS CITY'S VAULT SKY-HIGH. YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE STEALS THE TAXPAYERS' HARD-EARNED MONEY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO STOP THE RIDDLER! Officer: EVERYONE BACK UP! BACK TO THE CARS! THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORST, AND THEN WE WERE OFF TIME LINE. I'M LIKE, "THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GETTING TO CITY HALL BY TWO." Taylor: THEN I TRIED TO BEAT THE RUSH TO THE NEXT PLACE AFTER WITNESSING THIS CABLE CAR RESCUE. AND THERE WERE EVEN MORE CROWDS AT THE NEXT SCENE BY THE-THE BANK VAULT. IT WAS MONTGOMERY AND SANSOME. IT WAS EXACTLY WHERE I WAS STANDING TWO OR THREE YEARS EARLIER FOR THE WORLD SERIES PARADE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO! AND THERE WERE MORE CROWDS FOR THIS THAN THERE WERE FOR THE WORLD SERIES. [ PEOPLE CHEERING ] LET'S GO HERE. ALL RIGHT. HEY, BATKID. WHAT DOES THAT SAY? "SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT." YOU THINK THAT'S WHERE HE IS? LET'S GO GET HIM. Man: GET HIM, MAN. Woman: GO GET HIM, MILES! Woman #2: GO GET HIM, MILES! Natalie: WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND INTO THE VAULT. THAT KINDA SCARED HIM AT FIRST. AND HE DIDN'T WANNA GO AT FIRST, BUT THEN EJ KINDA, "LET'S DO THIS." EJ: SO HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE'VE BLOCKED THE BACK EXIT. WHEN HE GOES BEHIND THE BARS, WE CAN SHUT 'EM, OKAY? Woman: NOW WE'RE GONNA WAIT HERE... LET'S GO GET HIM. THE KEY TO THE WHOLE DAY WAS EJ. THEY BECAME FRIENDS THAT NIGHT BEFORE AT THE CIRCUS CENTER. THAT, TO ME, MADE HI-- YOU KNOW, THE SHY KID, COME OUT. IN HERE, IN THE VAULT. EJ: THERE WERE JUST ALL OF THESE LITTLE EXCHANGES BETWEEN US 'CAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY TWO GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING AS EACH OTHER. THERE HE IS. Riddler: WHERE'D YOU FLY IN FROM, BATMAN? AND WHO'S THE BIG GUY? YOUR CABLE CAR TRICK DIDN'T WORK. BUT IT DID. IN TWELVE SECONDS I'LL BE GONE AND YOU'LL TWO BE TRAPPED IN HERE IN THIS BANK VAULT FOREVER. TWELVE SECONDS, THAT'S NOT MUCH TIME. LET'S GET HIM. DON'T LET HIM GO OUT THE SECRET BACK WAY. CLOSE THE GATE. SHUT THE GATE. SHUT IT ALL THE WAY. WAIT! SHUT IT. BEHIND BARS ALREADY, RIDDLER? THAT'S GOT TO BE A RECORD. BATKID! RIDDLE ME THIS, BATKID! WHAT FLIES UNDERWATER, SLY AS A GHOST, WANTING TO SNATCH WHAT THIS CITY LOVES MOST? WHAT FLIES UNDERWATER? LET ME OUT! Officer: EXCUSE ME. Batkid: NO! THERE'S- THERE'S A CALL COMING IN FROM THE POLICE CHIEF. LET'S TAKE IT ON THE CEILING. DYNAMIC DUO, I'M AFRAID YOUR OLD NEMESIS THE RIDDLER-- HERE WE GO. THE CALLS SOMETIMES DON'T COME THROUGH IN THE VAULT. NICELY DONE, DYNAMIC DUO. YOU'VE SAVED THE CITY. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE WORKED UP QUITE AN APPETITE. HEAD ON DOWN TO THE BURGER BAR AND TELL 'EM, "LUNCH IS ON THE CHIEF OF POLICE." TIME FOR LUNCH! TAKE HIM AWAY, GUYS. Riddler: BATKID! Officer: THANK YOU, BATMAN. NICE GOING, BATKID. Riddler: BATKID! Officer: THANK YOU, BATMAN. NICE GOING, BATKID. HOW DARE YOU!? WIPE THAT LOOK OFF YOUR FACE. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED. THIS IS ALL PART OF THE PLAN! Man: THANK YOU, BATMAN. BATKID, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Miles: YOU'RE WELCOME! EJ: WE DID IT. WE CAUGHT THE RIDDLER. [ APPLAUSE ] WHO ARE YOU? BATMAN. I'M BATMAN. HANDSHAKE. DONE IT AGAIN. WE'VE DONE IT AGAIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PUT YOUR ARMS UP AND CHEER. READY? [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] ARE YOU HAVING FUN? YEAH. YEAH? YEAH. YEAH? YEAH. I WAS SO HUNGRY IN THERE. OH, ME, TOO. I'M HUNGRY, TOO. AND THE BANK VAULT GOT US CAUGHT UP ON TIME, AND THEN WE HAD A LEISURELY LUNCH. I DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO GO TO UNION SQUARE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT, BATKID. ARE WE READY? WHOA. PUT YOUR HOOD UP. AH, I CAN'T SEE. CAN'T SEE. OKAY, I'LL GUIDE YOU. I PROMISE. EJ: I'M GONNA PICK YOU UP. READY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO! Man: HEY, BATMAN, RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE. LET'S RUN. RUN. LET'S GO! HEY, RIGHT HERE. THIS WAY. GO IN RIGHT BEHIND US. HELLO, EVERYONE. YOU CAN WAVE, TOO. YAY! HAVE YOU WORKED UP AN APPETITE? YEAH. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. Miles: I KICKED THE RIDDLER'S BUTT. YOU HAVE SAVED THE DAY. Miles: I KICKED THE RIDDLER'S BUTT. YOU HAVE SAVED THE DAY. YOU KICKED THE RIDDLER'S BUTT? AW, THAT'S MY BATMAN. LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE. WOW! HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE? UH-UH. Cotton: WHEN YOU LOOKED DOWN AND YOU SAW THIS SEA OF PEOPLE IN THE CARS, IN THE MOTOR BRIGADE, IT-- LIKE, I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISITS. PUT YOUR RIGHT ARM WAY UP IN THE AIR. RIGHT ARM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AH, THEY ALL WAVED! Patricia: WHEN YOU WATCH WHOLE CONSTRUCTION CREWS LEAVE THEIR CONSTRUCTION SITE TO COME DOWN AND WAVE. AND IT WAS LIKE ONE-A THOSE REALLY CHEESY HALLMARK SHOWS ON TV WHERE YOU GO, "THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN!" BUT IT DID. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT ARE THEY DANCING AROUND FOR? [ LAUGHS ] BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THEY'RE DANCING FOR YOU. [ DANIEL MARTIN MOORE'S "TO MAKE IT TRUE" PLAYS ] EJ: ONCE IN A WHILE HE WOULD LOOK AT ME AND SAY, "WE CAUGHT THE RIDDLER!" AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT-- I DON'T KNOW W- WHERE REAL AND NOT REAL WAS, THERE, BUT HE WAS SO EXCITED. ♪♪ Clovicko: BY THE TIME THAT WE ARRIVED FOR LUNCH, THE BIG CARAVAN, LOU SEAL WAS SUPPOSED TO ALREADY BE HIDING UNDERNEATH THE PARKING LOT FOR HIS BIG KIDNAP. Jutan: HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND WE WERE GONNA HAVE A CHAT AND TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF-- THE STAGING AND THE CAR AND-- Clovicko: I CALLED OUR STAFF MEMBER THAT WAS COORDINATING THAT AND SHE'S LIKE, "YEAH, A LITTLE HICCUP." THE TRANSPORTATION THAT WE HAD DIDN'T WORK OUT. AND I HAD TO CALL AN UBER TAXI TO BRING LOU SEAL TO UNION SQUARE. Aziz: I GOT THE BEEP. I ACCEPTED THE BEEP. IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD AT FIRST. I'M LIKE, "WHAT IS THIS GUY DOIN' COMIN' IN TO MY CAR?" Jutan: BECAUSE, OF COURSE, WE HAD CLOSED THE ENTIRE CITY DOWN, LOU SEAL WAS STUCK IN TRAFFIC. Aziz: SO MANY PEOPLE. TRAFFIC STOPPED. Jutan: IT'S THIS GUY IN A MASSIVE SEAL COSTUME, LIKE, STUCK IN TRAFFIC. ANOTHER COP GOES, "WELL WHERE ARE THEY?" AND THEY HAD TO SEND A POLICE ESCORT TO GO GET 'EM. Aziz: IT WAS EXCITING, YOU KNOW? GOING THROUGH ALL THIS TRAFFIC WITHOUT NO STOPS. AN UBER TAXI PARTED THE CROWDS... CAME IN TO UNION SQUARE. I'M, LIKE, LOOKIN' AT THE CLOCK. I'M LIKE, MAN, WE GOTTA... Clovicko: LOU SEAL WILLINGLY GOT OUT OF THE CAR, WAVED AT ALL THE FANS, WALKED UNDER THE PARKING GARAGE INTO HIS CAPTURE. Jutan: THANKFULLY THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO WERE KIND ENOUGH TO, UH, YOU KNOW, SORT OF SUSPEND THEIR DISBELIEF FOR A LITTLE BIT. AND HE'S GOT HIS COSTUME ON ALREADY, SO I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. HE'S LIKE, "HEY, HOW'S IT GOING'? UH, I'M LOU SEAL." HIS COSTUME'S LARGE, SO...IS HE GONNA GO IN THE FRONT? IS GONNA GO ON THE BACK? WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW HE WAS GONNA FIT IN THE CAR, EVEN. AND WE'RE LITERALLY DRIVING OUT IN TWO MINUTES. WITH EVERY NEWS AGENCY IN THE WORLD ABOUT TO FILM US. SO WE GOT HIM IN THE FRONT AND ME IN THE BACK, KINDA KNEELING ON THE REALLY EXPENSIVE LEATHER SEAT. Clovicko: ONE OF THE GUYS, WHO WAS HELPING FROM OUR NATIONAL OFFICE, TURNED TO ME AND HE WAS LIKE, "WE'RE ON TIME." AND I WAS LIKE, "WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. WE ARE NOT MENTIONING THAT." Natalie: HE ATE SOME FOOD AND THEN WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I THINK I'M DONE SAVING PEOPLE FOR THE DAY." AND WE'RE LIKE, "WELL, I THINK YOU HAVE MORE WORK TO DO." AND HE'S JUST LIKE, "NO, I'M TIRED." EJ: THIS WHOLE DAY IS FOR HIM. AND IF HE CALLS IT AT LUNCHTIME, IT'S OVER AT LUNCHTIME. Nick: MILES HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NAPPER. HE SAID, "DAD, I'M-I'M-- DON'T THINK I WANNA DO THIS ANYMORE." DID YOU HAVE A GOOD LUNCH? YES. YEAH. DO YOU LIKE THE GIANTS? YEAH. DO YOU KNOW WHO THEIR MASCOT IS? WHAT? DO YOU KNOW WHO THEIR MASCOT IS? WHAT? THEIR MASCOT IS A SEAL. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT? WHAT FLIES UNDERWATER? Natalie: THERE WE GO. A..? BIRD. A PENGUIN. PENGUINS CAN SWIM. THEY CAN FLY UNDERWATER. LOOK! THERE'S A BANNER. WHAT DOES IT SAY? WHAT? THE PENGUIN HAS LOU SEAL. LOOK. IT'S THE GIANTS' MASCOT, LOU SEAL AND THE PENGUIN. THEY'RE POINTING. OH, MY GOODNESS. EJ: AND THEN AS SOON AS HE LOOKED OUT AND HE SAW THE PENGUIN WITH LOU SEAL, HE STARTED TO REV UP. [ CROWD CHANTING "BATKID" ] BATKID? [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] I THINK THERE'S A CALL COMING IN FROM THE POLICE CHIEF. Suhr: HOLY BATWINGS, BATMAN AND BATKID.

YA GOTTA GET THERE. YA GOTTA STOP HIM. FOR THE GIANTS AND THEIR FANS, YA JUST CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. [ CROWD CHANTING "BATKID" ] EJ: AND HIS DAD CAME OVER AND SAID, "WHAT IF I RIDE IN THE BATMOBILE WITH YOU." OH, OKAY. AND THAT WAS-- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S- THAT'S IT. HE HIT ME ON THE ARM AND SAID, "WE HAVE TO GO!" THE THING IS, MILES, YA KNOW, HE BATTLED LEUKEMIA, AND WHEN YOU'RE TIRED, YOU CAN'T STOP. NO. OH, NO! OH, NO! LET'S GO THIS WAY. RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE. WE'LL CATCH UP WITH HIM. Penguin: BATKID, IT'S ON, BABY! Natalie: HE'S LIKE, "WELL, DO YOU WANNA GO WITH HIM?" I'M LIKE, "NICK, I DON'T CARE ABOUT RIDING IN A LAMBORGHINI. I KNOW YOU WANT TO, SO YOU JUST GO." Nick: SO I GOT A RIDE IN THE BATMOBILE WHICH IS PRETTY NEAT, BUT, UH, NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR THREE PEOPLE IN ONE OF THOSE. WE CREATED THE PENGUIN TWITTER HANDLE, AND THEN SCRIPTED ALL OF HIS TWEETS THAT WERE TAUNTING MILES AND TAUNTING THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND IT WAS A WAY TO GET INFORMATION OUT IN A CUTE, CREATIVE WAY. Penguin: GOTHAM WILL BE MINE! BATKID WILL NEVER STOP ME! [ CROWD BOOING ] PENGUIN! PENGUIN! Kyle: AND WE SHOW UP AND THERE'S, LIKE, JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WALKING ON THE SIDEWALKS. AND IT'S-- IT WAS-- IT SEEMED BIGGER THAN EVEN, YOU KNOW, THE BASEBALL GAMES THAT HAPPEN HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS. Fajardo: THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GATES JUST TRYING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE CAR OR HIM KIND OF RUNNING INTO THE BALLPARK. LUCKILY THERE WAS A LOT OF EXTRA POLICE AND SECURITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE KIND OF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE BALLPARK TO HELP MANAGE THE CROWDS OUT THERE. WE'RE GOING IN. THERE'S A GATE OVER HERE. LOOK! LOOK. Man: BATKID! SAVE LOU SEAL! DO YOU SEE HIM? OH, NO! IT'S BATKID! OH, NO! OKAY, LET'S GO. Kyle: THIS KID WAS WALKING UP THESE STAIRS.

AND TO PROVE IT, YOU NEED TO HEAD ON OVER TO CITY HALL. WHERE THE MAYOR OF GOTHAM AWAITS YOU WITH THE KEY TO THE CITY AND A WELL-DESERVED HERO'S WELCOME. HERE'S LOOKIN' AT YOU, DYNAMIC DUO: SF'S FINEST. WHOO! THAT WAS THE HEAD OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. EJ: IT HIT ME PRETTY HARD A FEW TIMES DURING THE DAY. YOU KNOW, I GET CHOKED UP BUT I HAVE A SUPERHERO MASK ON SO NOBODY CAN TELL. YOU HAVIN' FUN? MM-HM. YOU HAVIN' FUN? MM-HM. YEAH? WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY? UH. CATCHING THE RIDDLER. CATCHING THE RIDDLER WAS YOUR FAVORITE? UH-HUH. CATCHING THE RIDDLER WAS YOUR FAVORITE? UH-HUH. De Jesus: WELL, WE WERE ON THE BUS AND THERE WAS A MAN AND HE BASICALLY TAPS ME ON THE SHOULDER, AND HE'S LIKE, "OBAMA JUST REPLIED TO YOUR TWEET!" AND THE ENTIRE BUS STARTED, YOU KNOW, CHEERING AND APPLAUDING. AND I LOOKED AT MY PHONE AND I WAS SHAKING BECAUSE I SAW, YOU KNOW, "BARACK OBAMA, UH, REPLIED TO YOUR TWEET." WAY TO GO, MILES. WAY TO SAVE GOTHAM. De Jesus: SEE, I THINK I TOOK LIKE THREE SCREEN SHOTS JUST TO BE SURE, YOU KNOW, ON YOUR PHONE SO THAT I HAD IT FOR PROOF. [ SIREN WAILING ] CAN I GET A HIGH FIVE?! YEAH! GREAT DAY! Natalie: THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST NERVE-RACKING PART FOR ME. WE LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN AND SO YOU HEAR ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THESE SCARY THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT THESE BIG EVENTS. BUT THAT WAS NOT. I MEAN, EVERYONE WAS SO HAPPY. Clovicko: I HAD TWO FRIENDS THAT WERE THERE. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY SAID THAT THEY'VE EVER BEEN THERE WITH THAT MANY PEOPLE, AND PEOPLE WERE NICE TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS LIKE THE BEST THING I'VE EVER PARTICIPATED IN. Man: I WANTED TO BE BATMAN WHEN I WAS LITTLE, TOO. THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Mayor Lee: FELLOW CITIZENS OF GOTHAM CITY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO GOTHAM CITY HALL. IT WAS A FANTASY FOR ME TO BE UP THERE SAYING I'M, FOR AN HOUR, THE MAYOR OF GOTHAM CITY. I WANNA THANK THE BATKID FOR SAVING OUR CITY! LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT. LOOK TO THE MAYOR. WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT YOU?! THE STREETS OF OUR CITY ARE SAFER BECAUSE OF YOU. IT IS MY PLEASURE, TODAY, TO PRESENT TO YOU THE KEY TO GOTHAM CITY BY THE BAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. LOOK TO THE RIGHT. Suhr: AND MILES THOUGHT IT WAS CHOCOLATE. HE WAS TOLD, "YOU'RE GETTIN' A CHOCOLATE KEY TO THE CITY." SO THAT'S WHY, IF YOU LOOK AT 'IM, HE'S TOTALLY, LIKE, "WHAT'S UP WITH THIS, MAN? I MEAN, I GOT TOLD I WAS GETTIN' HOOKED UP WITH TWO POUNDS OF CHOCOLATE." THE MASTER OF CHOCOLATE MANUFACTURING, TCHO CHOCOLATES, MADE A SPECIAL KEY FOR YOU AND YOUR BROTHER. LATER ON, YOU'LL GET TO MUNCH ON THAT KEY ALL YOU WANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY DECIDED TO GIVE US AN ADVANCED COPY OF TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPER. "GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLE," "BATKID SAVES THE CITY!" NORMALLY, AS CHIEF OF POLICE, I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF FLASH MOBS. BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THIS IS ABOUT AS COOL AS I EVER SEEN. Patricia: NOW FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. AND LISTEN UP. MILES FINISHED HIS CHEMOTHERAPY IN JUNE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OUR SUPERHERO IS IN REMISSION AND, TODAY, I THINK WE GAVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF HIS CHILDHOOD BACK! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ CROWD CHANTING "BATKID" ] IT'S...IT'S H-- ARE THERE WORDS? I DON'T THINK-- NO. I DON'T THINK-- NO. SO MUCH BIGGER THAN I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED. SO MUCH MORE LOVE. EJ: AFTERWARD, AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE GOT TOGETHER FOR A LITTLE AFTER-PARTY. AND THEN MILES AND HIS FAMILY SHOWED UP. BY THAT TIME, I HAD ACTUALLY PULLED THE MASK OFF. AND I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THAT HE SEES THAT THE COACH IS BATMAN. SO I JUST SAID, UH, "I BET NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THE ACROBAT COACH IS ACTUALLY..." AND HE SAID, "YOU'RE RIGHT!" AND, UH, HE EVEN TOLD ME ONE TIME THAT-THAT BRUCE WAYNE IS FOR THE MOVIES. EJ'S BATMAN. IT'S LIKE PATRICIA'S CITY. SHE LIVES IN GOTHAM CITY. Woman: HAVE YOU BEEN THERE? YEAH. THAT'S WHEN I BECAME BATKID. WAS IT FUN? YEP! EJ: FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES WHATEVER HAPPENS, THERE WILL BE GOOD STUFF, THERE WILL BE BAD STUFF, WE WILL HAVE THAT DAY. THE NEXT MORNING, WE WOKE UP IN KIND OF A WEIRD DREAM, JUST TOTALLY RELAXED. AT SOME POINT DURING THE DAY WE LOOKED AT OUR EMAIL. I HAD SEVENTY-ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-NINE UNREAD MESSAGES. AND IT WAS OVERFLOWING. Patrick: I HAD VOICE MAILS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD JUST BREAK DOWN AND CRY. I WANT TO JUST THANK THEM ALL. IS THERE A WAY TO DO THAT? WE GOT FAN MAIL FROM FRANCE. WE GOT FAN MAIL FROM CHINA. Nick: I MEAN, WE GOT POSTCARDS FROM OVERSEAS JAPAN, GERMANY, U.K., STUFF FROM ALL OVER. WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF FROM AKRON, OHIO, LIKE SCHOOL CLASSES THAT COLORED PICTURES AND DREW PICTURES. Natalie: THERE WAS A CLASS, I THINK IT WAS FROM TENNESSEE AND THEY WROTE A COMIC BOOK ABOUT MILES. Clovicko: SOMEBODY JUST SENT, LIKE, "BATKID CARE OF CITY HALL." AND SAN FRANCISCO'S SO AWESOME THAT THEY GOT US THE MAIL. Patricia: ONE OF THE INTERVIEWS REVEALED THAT THEY STILL HAD MEDICAL EXPENSES THAT WEREN'T COVERED. A COUPLE OF FOLKS DONATED TO COVER THE FAMILY'S MEDICAL EXPENSES. THE WISH MOM SAID, "WELL, I HAVE TO TALK TO NICK. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN ACCEPT IT." AND I SAID, "WELL, TOO BAD BECAUSE IT'S BEING GIVEN OUT OF LOVE." I WISH EVERY PARENT DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. Mayor Lee: WELL, WHEN IT GREW FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE A VERY SIMPLE COUPLE OF EVENTS TO OVER FIVE DIFFERENT EVENTS WITH A MAIN STAGE AT CIVIC CENTER AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING DOWN... OBVIOUSLY, THERE WAS A COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT WHICH THE CITY PAID OUT OF THEIR CONVENTION FUND BECAUSE IT WAS FEATURING SAN FRANCISCO, SO THEY THOUGHT IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT TO FOCUS ON SAN FRANCISCO. I HEARD ONE OF THE NEWSCASTERS SAY IT WAS THE BEST MONEY SAN FRANCISCO EVER SPENT. BUT SOME PEOPLE USED THAT TO SAY, "WELL, I DON'T THINK THE CITY SHOULD'VE FUNDED THAT." WE WERE VERY, VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE JOHN AND MARCIA GOLDMAN OF THE GOLDMAN FOUNDATION STEP UP. AND THEY SAID THEY WERE SO MOVED THAT THEY DONATED ONE-HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO COVER ALL OF THE COSTS. Patricia: THAT DISCUSSION'S OFF THE TABLE. THERE'S JUST NOTHING NEGATIVE YOU CAN SAY NOW. Jutan: WE HEARD SOME CRAZY STATISTIC LIKE TWO BILLION PEOPLE, UH, POTENTIALLY SAW THIS. Mayor Lee: I TOOK A TRIP TO CHINA, AND PEOPLE IN CHINA CAME UP TO ME, SPEAKING IN MANDARIN, "I LOVE THAT BATKID. I WISH WE WOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF EVENT IN OUR CITY." Patricia: I TALKED TO A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO SAID VOLUNTEERISM IS UP, THAT PEOPLE ARE CITING BATKID AS A REASON TO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Jutan: I DO REMEMBER THE NEXT MONDAY, I TOOK A BUS TO WORK. I GOT ON THE BUS AND EVERYONE WAS SMILING. THERE WAS SOMETHING POSITIVE IN THE AIR. THE BUS DRIVER WAS, "HOW'S IT GOIN'? HOW ARE YA?" PEOPLE SEEMED TO BE JUST...KINDER THAT DAY. Clovicko: IT'S AMAZING THE CAPACITY THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT I DON'T THINK WE GIVE OURSELVES OR WE GIVE ONE ANOTHER SOMETIMES. AND A FIVE-YEAR-OLD RESTORED HUMANITY. Jutan: IT'S KIND OF ODD, ALMOST, THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN MORE. Natalie: SO FRIDAY AT SCHOOL HE GOT IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO LITTLE BOYS THAT WERE FIGHTING, AND MILES WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM WHILE THEY WERE SWINGING. AND MILES ENDED UP GETTING KICKED, BUT HE WAS TRYING TO RESOLVE THEIR ISSUE. AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "SON, YOU HAVE TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS." YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THEN HE WAS SAD 'CAUSE HE GOT IN TROUBLE 'CAUSE HE WAS GETTING IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. HE WANTS EVERYONE TO GET ALONG. FOR THOSE THREE YEARS, YOU'RE RETRAINING HIS BLOOD CELLS, AND YOU'RE GIVING HIM MEDICINE, AND SO YOU'RE KEEPING THINGS AT BAY. AND THEN IT'S LIKE YOU STOP, AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WELL, WHAT IF?" I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING ANYMORE. LIKE, I SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING. "WHEN I'M FEELING LOVED, I FEEL WARM AND SAFE AND PROTECTED." Nick: FOR THE MOST PART, IT'S BACK TO NORMAL, YOU KNOW. AT SCHOOL IS-- EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM AS BATKID. IT WAS AT THE PERFECT AGE THAT THIS WISH HAPPENED. IF HE WOULD'VE BEEN OLDER, I THINK IT WOULD'VE GONE A LOT MORE TO HIS HEAD. UH, THAT'S WHY WE WERE KINDA, AFTER THE BASEBALL, WHEN HE THREW OUT THE FIRST PITCH, WE WERE KINDA LIKE, LET'S KINDA STOP IT SO IT DOESN'T... HE DOESN'T GET CONCEITED, AND WE DON'T-WE DON'T WANT THAT AT ALL. HE HAS THE BATKID SUIT STILL. HE DOESN'T WEAR IT UNLESS HE'S DOING SOMETHING WITH EJ. REMEMBER WHAT TO DO IF THE HOOD COMES DOWN OVER YOUR EYES? YOU JUST GO, "CAN'T SEE. CAN'T SEE." IT'S LIKE HAVING A NEW LITTLE BROTHER. LIKE THAT? WHO ARE YOU? BATMAN! I MEAN HE'LL WEAR A PIECE HERE AND THERE WHEN HE'S PLAYIN' DRESS-UP, BUT LIKE THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER IS FOR WORK. AND IF THERE'S NO WORK TO BE DONE, HE'S NOT PUTTING IT ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Natalie: AND OBVIOUSLY HE HAD FUN, BUT I DON'T THINK HE REALLY GOT IT. WHAT ARE THEY DANCING AROUND FOR? [ LAUGHS ] BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THEY'RE DANCING FOR YOU. I MEAN, HE SAW ALL THE PEOPLE AND STUFF, BUT HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IMPACTED THEM SO MUCH AND WHY IT MADE EVERYONE SO HAPPY. Taylor: I THINK THAT WE-WE ALL LIKE TO PLAY, AND WE ALL FORGET HOW TO PLAY. AND WE-WE DESPERATELY NEED IT. EJ: WHEN KIDS ARE KIDS, THERE'S A TIME DURING EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY RUN ABSOLUTELY AS FAST AS THEY CAN. AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE A GROWN-UP, AT SOME POINT YOU STOP DOING THAT. WITH THE BATKID DAY, THERE WERE SO MANY REASONS NOT TO DO IT. GOOD NEWS IS, HE DIDN'T HAVE THE GROWN-UP PART OF HIM THAT SAID YOU COULDN'T DO SOMETHING. Zimmer: LISTEN TO A LITTLE BOY. LISTEN TO SOMEBODY DREAMING. LISTEN TO SOMEBODY HAVING A PREPOSTEROUS PLAN. IN A FUNNY WAY, I MEAN, THAT'S HOW I LIVE MY LIFE. EVERYBODY WANTED ME TO BECOME AN ACCOUNTANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IF YOU'RE A MUSICIAN, EVERYBODY TELLS YOU DON'T DO IT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. AND MILES WAS SAYING THE SAME THINGS. YOU KNOW, HE WAS SAYING, "BUT WHY ARE YOU GUYS TELLING ME IT'S IMPOSSIBLE?" Man: SO WAS THIS WHAT YOU GUYS EXPECTED? MM-HM. NO. NO. DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE HOLDING UP SIGNS SAYING, "SAVE US, BATKID" AND I TH-I TH-I LOOKED AT THOSE SIGNS AND I THOUGHT, "YOU MEAN THAT LITERALLY." IN HELPING HIM TO LIVE THIS DREAM, WE WERE SAVING OURSELVES. WE WERE SAVING SOMETHING ROTTEN ABOUT OUR GROWN-UP SOULS. AND WE WERE REMEMBERING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. WE WONDER WHY WE'RE NOT HAPPY A LOT OF THE TIME, AND IT'S BECAUSE WE FORGET THIS SORT OF THING.
