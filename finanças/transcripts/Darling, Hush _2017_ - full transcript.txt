An obelisk topped with a sculptured hand holding seven severed heads. In 1663, Alexander, the 13th chief of the McGavern clan, took it upon himself to hunt down the followers of the pagan god of fertility, Cernunnos. These seven disciples stole the newborns from all corners of the land. (DARK TONES) Pure blood would rejuvenate the soil and deliver riches. The spirit of Cernunnos is said to still walk the woodlands and glades, sacrificing bairns in sanctified burial grounds. (DARK TONES) Blah, blah, blah. Their ken, known as loners or hillbillies, can still be found in parts of the Highlands today. I think I need another drink. (BOAT HORN BLARES) Fucking hell.
