It's the fourth time I'm changing the water. Good for you! Please, come along. Come, Mommy. I'll get an ashtray, but don't lock the door, OK? I look like a whore, don't I? Mhm. Do something then or I'll go crazy! My eyelashes, wait! It's all your fault! I might have graduated from school... and been somebody, had a cushy office job... Careful, it stings! Instead I was landed with a little squirt like you! And you regret it? No. Don't you dare ask me that again, or I'll kick you so you will hit the wall. You're gorgeous, just like a film star. Did you learn that at school? They teach us how to blend colours. Maybe you'll be a proper artist, a painter? You must do well at school, get straight A's. - I do. - But do you work hard? - I do! - Do you focus? You're the only man in my life. - What's this? - I... I... Why did you eat her sandwich? She should take a look in the mirror. Last week he ate mine, and now Mariola's. - Fetch your mother. - I swear I won't do it again. Go home and get her. She's at work. He's lying. His mother's always at home. All day in her dressing gown. That's not true! She's gone to work. Then she must let me have... the name and address of her employers and her working hours. Where exactly does she work? Go now, go. Mom, open the door, I know you're there! What do you want? I said I didn't want you to wear that dressing gown! I told you a hundred times! I told you a hundred times! - What's the time? - 1 1 o'clock. - Go back to school! - I won't go! You must let them have the details of where you work. - Oh, really? - Really. Name, address, and working hours. - Who said that? - My class teacher. Then ask her what business is it of hers? What do I do? I don't know. Stay away from school, and the playground as well. Go to aunt Lena's or to the movies, and manage to get yourself a lunch. Go on, don't worry. You're the only man I love, you know that? Ralphie! Give me a hand, dear. You're a good boy. None of my four husbands was as much use. Look out! Ralph! Ralph! Did you bring the stamp? Ralfie! Let him sleep. OK, I'll let him sleep. It's all settled. Sweet dreams. You don't want tea? Come along then. Mom! You wrote: "Come and see me in the morning". Mom! Where have you been? What do you want? You've been drinking again? Don't bother me. Who was it? - None of your bloody business! - Who was it? That's not your business I said! Nobody was to come here! I don't want any guys here! You're a trollop, a slag! I hate you! Ralph! Ralph! Present! Present! Present! Present! What's this? Here's the firm's stamp. Café Mascot. - What's that? - Where his mother works I expect. He was told to bring the address. You bet she works! What does she do? - Why won't you say? - He's ashamed. She works with her knickers down. What's this? What are you doing?! Fetch his mother at once! Excuse me, sir, did you call me because he trashed those brats? - He was quite right! - It's not because of that. Look sir, after school he stays at home, he doesn't steal, he's a good boy! Come inside. He's read all the books they have in the library! Did you know that? He grew a lemon tree at home which... was so good... the teacher put it in the flower contest! Did you know that? He gets good grades and doesn't tell tales! Is he to be insulted by... some stupid bitches with establishment dads? He has no establishment father, thank god! He has no father at all, only me. And I won't let him be bullied. Please calm down. The point is he's hungry and high-strung. I understand your difficulties. We want to help you. Come inside and write an application. We’ll find some way of financing extra meals. Pardon me, but what do you mean by saying that he's hungry? It's true. He's growing and so is his appetite. There have been complaints... that he takes food from other children's lunchboxes. Wait a moment. Tell me, are you hungry? Are you hungry? No. He never tells lies! What sort of frame-up is this? Who's paying you? - Please come inside! - We’ll find another school! I won't be insulted like that! Ralph! Do you have everything? We're leaving! Good bye! You'll get what you deserve in the end! Just wait! Take a deep breath, it'll settle your nerves. That's the third school this year. So what? You'll have some rest. I'll think up something after Christmas. They'll send me to a community home... if I don't attend school regularity. No, they'd have to lock me up first. Why should they put you in prison, mom? Mom, help! Here you are. - Bon apetit. - How much do I pay? A kiss. - I'm serious. - So am I. Will you step aside for a moment, sir? Do you know, that I love you, young man? And that I'm jealous? That lady means nothing to me. Why this particular school? Witek made the arrangements. Who's Witek? A fellow I know. Someone we can depend on. Are you nervous? Chin up! Quiet! Wait here. He fell asleep over a book. Look: - "Language and the Universe". - How fine that sounds! Take your coat off. I must put my shoes on. - What's his name? - Ralph. - How old is he? - Eleven. - Is he a hooligan? - Of course not! - You want to see his grades? - Yes! Quiet... quiet! I can't find it. Look! - You're right. - All straight A's. - Shall we drink to him? - I'll just put this back. Take the book. "Don't be afraid that the going is tough". "There are wrong turnings ahead". "But straight paths enough". - You know what she said? - Wait! "It is the point to always walk ahead Despite frequently seeing Your precious dream has fled". She said she'd never enjoyed going to bed with me. And that it was only he... who started her sex - glands roaring... - Do you have any kids? - Three daughters. Stupid, the lot of them, like their mother. Who's the man then? - A smuggler. - The real one? A long-distance trucker. He's loaded with contraband. Don't those customs officers... - ever notice anything? - Quiet... Did you see them? First she hotfooted it down to the bathroom... stark naked; he had his clothes on. When they came out, they were both in the raw. Then the light went out and I couldn’t see anything. Later she said... that our entire marriage... All the girls around got married, so she had to, as well. Our three daughters, she said, were just a fluke, because I didn't... give her any pleasure, and it's only now, with him that her sex-glands started roaring. What am I to do? Wait. Ralph, Ralph! Listen to this! In the kitchen there's a guy... Wake up, listen, please! This guy has a wife and three daughters. His wife deceives him with a smuggler, a long distance trucker, who cheats the customs. Those customs men don't notice anything. His wife says she's never loved him, and their whole marriage was a mistake. Just today that guy's found out, that his whole life has collapsed. - What should he do? - Mom, he isn't someone we can depend on. He said... you know what... Aunt Lena, come quickly! - Is it bad? - No, it's only her nerves. My third husband was an orderly... in an asylum, so I know all the symptoms. Bring a bottle and my knitting from upstairs. No! - Do what she says. - You're not to drink! - Maybe he's right? - Give me the vodka. Go, quickly, go! Did you take any pills? Do I look as if I took some? He chucked them all out. - A bloody guardian angel. - I'm neither an angel nor a guardian. He turns up day after day. He threatens me, won't leave me alone. Ralph, go and do your homework, there's nothing you can do now. Get out. Hi, Ralphie. Can we have a talk, you know, man to man? I have no time, I must do my homework. I saw your monthly grades. Nothing but A's. - My name is Stan. - You the one with the smuggler? Does she have somebody, you know...? She has me. - You know what I mean. - I don't know and I don't want to. Wait. Wait! Ralphie! - Why cover up for her? - You think I care? Listen, of all her acquaintances, I'm the only one, who's half-way decent. Decency! What does it have to do? Go home and do something about... your wife and her smuggler. And leave my mother alone! Ma! Your mother's living high. Not really. Not really? She could have gone to Canada with me. - Did she tell you? - We're doing fine here Not so cocky! Why aren't you at school then? I was. I get nothing but A's. But it's the third school this year, isn't it? You see, I'm well informed. Is your mother seeing anyone? - She does. - Who? Me. But seriously! Seriously! Little smart-ass, aren't we? What do you want? I'm the one who asks questions round here! Get it? Slow, slow, quick, quick... - What are you doing here? - Why did you give him a key? What are you talking about? I told you I didn't want anyone moving in! I'm not going to end-up nursemaid to some bawling kid! - What are you up to?! - Even if it's solid gold! Hear me? I swear I'll always be true to you. Do your homework. Coming! Good morning. We have a search warrant... What is it about? It's with regard to illegal sales of liquor. At my place? We’ll start with the kitchen. Check the cupboard. How long have you been peddling vodka? During the war I did a bit of peddling, but never liquor, as God's my witness. Don't take the lord's name in vain. - What's the kid doing here? - His homework. - Please, open the sofa-bed. - It's too heavy for me. We’ll give you a hand. - Chris Traczyk's boy. - So big already? She doesn't look after him, does she. Why don't you get off my mom, and look after your Cath who's kissing boys in the cellar? Keep cool, you are here as a witness. Go home, this isn't a fit place for you. I don't have a key. Besides, she was to help me with my sums, right? Right. Here it is. Only two? For Christmas, you know. - Well, what do you say? - Me? - I just don't want any trouble! - That'll be all then. Good bye. Go-od-eve-ning Miss! Excuse me, was this paper no good? No, it was good. But it's not your own work. If it had been my own, what would you have given me? - An A+. - Then give me an A Are you crazy? A child your age using complex subordinate clauses! I'm not a child! I'm Ralph Traczyk. Give me your record book. I'll have to write a reprimand. Here's the letter to the Mental heath clinic. Mental heath? What's he been up to? He got a bad grade and tore up his record book. I'm sure he didn't deserve it. She said... I didn't write it myself. So who did? The pope? Nobody ever helps him with his homework! This child does everything on his own, I work and he doesn't have a father. - He did not write it himself... - What he wrote is good, but you don't understand it. Mealy-mouthed mediocrities... That's who you prefer and who you give A's to. You know where you can stick it? C'm on Ralph. Are you taking him away from school? That's right, good bye! I'll take you to court for persecuting the kids in your care! - Who is it? - A friend. I've brought you fish for Christmas. - That one doesn't like me. - But it's clear Stan does. - That one's his spitting image. - Look, it's Stan! You ought to thank God for a son like him. - What about the presents? - It's time, now! For mother from Santa Claus. - A dressing gown! - For aunt Lena. Thank you. Look, it's fantastic! For Chris and Ralph. Thank you! For Ralph. Terrific! How did you know? Now I'll show you something. You're in luck. A real man... Tell me who gave it to you? Was it Stan? Why should Stan give me anything? - I think he's in love with you. - Don't be absurd! He is in love, I can tell. - They all want the same thing. - Will you marry him, mom? Get good grades at school! How much is it worth? I do get good grades. With very good grades you can even become an officer. Whatever you want, mom. You're all I have. You must get an education and become somebody! And he'll earn peanuts! You can have it. Do you think I give a damn about the ring? You want it Ralphie? If you like I can chuck it out of a window. I don't care! Hell of a Christmas! Have it! The right foot... - Do try, please. - Come back and help me. - Right foot... - Which one? In the silent night, the shepherds as they lay Heard the voice ring out God is born this day. I love you. Mom! Aren't you ever ill? At my age, that would mean I was dead. Mother's still asleep. She drank too much. Now my third husband... he could keep pace with me. Something else is bothering her. Has she fallen in love? That's bad. First she gave that Joe the cold shoulder, And now Stan will get the same treatment. - What's that for? - To cheer us up. My goose! Get your mom! Right away! Get up! Dinner's ready, and you look like a slut! Get out another bottle, Ralphie. It's Socked. Do you have the key? Sure I do. What the hell! You've been up to something? Come here. Come. I'll bring some from downstairs. - Mom! - Leave me alone! Let go! I expect the key got mislaid somewhere. - What are you looking for? - My pills. I'll give you some other. They're no good. I want my special prescription. Mom! - Did you hide them? - I threw them away. - Give them to me. - I threw them away... Come on, let me have them please. You asked me to get rid of them yourself. Really, have a look. - Give them to me! - But I told you I can't. Come on, please... You'll cut your wrists again or jump out of the window! Mom! Mom! No! Mom... Mommy... Mom... Here. Christine Traczyk, the daughter of Victor... - Hush, she's asleep. - Please, wake her up. - Wake her yourself. - Get up! Hurry up, get dressed! Pull off the cover. What's happening here? Who tied you up? Red Indians. - And who are you? - Winnetou. Making false statements is punishable by law! Why are you here? You're under arrest, you're coming with us. No! No! - Are you taking him too? - He'll go to a children's home. - You've been deprived of custody. - By whom? - By court order. - Was there a trial? There was. But you didn't trouble to turn up at the hearing. It doesn't matter now, the child can't be left alone. No!!!! Ralph! Kick her! Get your hands off him! Ralph, bite her! Calm down, it'll be aright! Mom, it's a mistake! It's no good, we won't get away. - I love you. - I love you too. I'll get nothing but A's. B's will do. Come along. Come. - Your grandma's here. - I don't have one. That's true. She's brought heaps of food. Aunt Lena! Sonny! - What about mom? - She's inside. Did she kill someone? What an idea! Just a little racket at the Café. She always had a little racket going. That's for you. Evie's old man turned up with a bag of cookies! Hey, kiddo! Have a piece. - Come on, it's your turn. - I can't. - I'm waiting for that old slut. - She won't turn up. She will. You're crazy. You'll come, you stupid bitch, you'll come! Give it back. Eat. Where did you get it? You stole it? I got it from home. Would you like to be my brother? No. Why not? Do you have a sister? No, - but I'm only staying a few weeks. - They all say that. If you agree to be my brother, you can beat me up whenever you like. Please, Ralph. My darling, my one and only love. It's not so very dreadful here. Maybe because my thoughts Are always with you. In my dreams I see your eyes, your smile. You know how I loved you to smile. That’s when I felt my lousy life might take A turn for the better. I need you very much. I know I didn't treat you well, but I swear I'll change. Don't send me anything. We live in hopes of an amnesty. Just find me A lawyer... and pay the rent. Maybe they'll let me see you at Easter. I send you 1022 kisses, the kind you like best. All my love. Yours for ever. - Ralph? - Yes? I'm Witek. Come over here. I've a letter for you. Your mother put it in the wrong envelope... Have you had a letter from her, by any chance? No. Ralph! Do you need anything? Money maybe? No. Mother needs a lawyer and perhaps someone... could pay the rent. That's all settled. Ralphie! She's gorgeous! My dearest mom! Come on, let's go! Mom! Let's go or we’ll be late! I can't take you home. Why not? I have no place to go. I let our apartment to some couple with a child... Mom... What about you? I'm staying with aunt Lena. You won't have to go back to prison? Don't worry! I'll stick it a bit longer. Come for the end of the school year. On June 20, don't forget. Jesus... Sit down. Have they moved out? Who? The tenants with their baby... Chris, where's my bath robe? I'm sorry. Hello. That's Witek. He's been very good to us. Remember, I don't like it too dry. I remember. He lives in my room? For the time being. We're looking for something bigger. Do you love him? Yes. Not so long ago you said something different. What? You said I was the only man in your life. Ralph, that hasn't changed. You let him have my room and my bath robe. The one I bought you for Christmas. An orphanage for me and eggs for him. You never made me scrambled eggs. I love you. I know the things went wrong. That was my fault. It'll all be different now, you'll see. You'll get scrambled eggs, proper meals, it's what you always wanted. I no longer need the pills. Aren't you glad? I go to bed early. After all that's what you wanted! You always wanted to have a vacation. He suggested the mountains But I told him it had to be the seaside... because that's where you always wanted to go. He's closing the store for the whole July. And he's bought three deck-chairs. We were so full of plans, but nothing ever came of them. He'll bring us luck, you'll see. Believe me, it's our very last chance! I let you down, but you're still the only... man in my life. He'll be my husband. He told me he loved me. That he'd waited for me for all his life. Say it's all right. Please! What's the matter with him? A bad case of homesickness. Ralph! You had a fever, I couldn’t sleep a wink. I've brought you something. I don't want it. Take it. - Where did you get it? - It's Evie's, I pinched it. - Please, take it. - I don't want it. Please! I could do with grades like that! Hi. You're late. I was putting my make up on. You know how long it takes. Conduct-outstanding. Just as I promised - straight A's. Your room's waiting for you. And him? - What about him? - Has he moved out? No. He's waiting too. We all are. - Are you coming? - No. Just a little longer, gentlemen. OK, you can clear off. Subtitles by: Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka
