Subtitles by explosiveskull There are moments in our lives that seem to define us. Moments we keep going back to. My life before him was so simple and decided. And now after him... there's just... after. Tessa! Okay, what are we forgetting? - Hair dryer? - No. - Flashlight. - Mom, it's college. It's not a survival course. Towels, battery charger, phone charger... I can... I can always drive anything up if you forget it. Okay, we should get going. We have a long drive ahead. - Okay. - Let's do a last-minute room check. Oh, wait. - Mom. - Thanks, baby. - We're on the right floor. - B-22... - B-22... - Um... B-22. Twenty-two. Hey. Hi. Um... Steph? In the flesh. I'm Tessa. Hey, it's my new roomie. This is Tristan. - Hey. - Hi. - I'm Tessa. - Come in. We're not gonna bite. Oh, sorry. So, this is my mom and this is Noah. - Hello. - Hi. Full disclosure. I was pretty bummed to be paired with a freshman, then I thought, "Hello, bright side... I'm gonna be your spirit guide." We can get you into all the best places, even without a fake. No problem. Mom. I like your sweater. Thanks. I, uh... I got it from The Gap. Cute. We're going straight down to the housing office right now - and requesting a room change. - What... What are you talking about? That room reeked of... Can you please not make a scene? I'm not. - We have worked too hard for this... - Okay. ...and I don't want you to be distracted by anyone. Mom, this is me that we're talking about. Can you please just trust me? It will be fine, I promise. I promise. Guys. Wait up. The house is gonna be so empty without you. I know. I'll miss you. Oh, God, I am so proud of you. Thanks, Mom. Okay. I love you, my baby. I'm going. See you later. Bye. I got it. This is the part I've been dreading. Me too. Oh, I was actually talking about the ride home with your mom. Mm. Mm. Okay. How much did I freak your mom out? Um... She thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence? She's just very protective. It's always only been the two of us. No. No thanks. See? Seems like she has nothing to worry about. Your brother's cute. Oh, you mean Noah? No, he's my boyfriend. - Sorry. - No, it's okay. He's a senior in high school. That's Tristan. I'm supposed to meet her. What's with all the old books? Who brings books to college? Me... I guess. The bookish vibe. I like that. - All right, I'm out. - Okay. Bye. - Hi. - Hey. - Econ 101? - Yeah. It's locked. Yeah. - I already tried... I tried it. - Right. Couple of early birds, huh? Have fun in there. - Oh. After you. - Sorry. After you. - No, no... - No, no... - Honestly. I insist. - No, I insist. - No, honestly... - No, my mother raised me to... Okay. - Are you a first year, too? - Yeah. Are you an econ major? That's the plan. You? I'm an English major. - I'm Landon, by the way. - Tessa. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. Good morning. I'm Professor Alexander. And welcome to Econ 101. This might be the most important class you take here, so I expect everyone here to closely pay attention and benefit from the 25-year career I had on Wall Street. Now let's get started. Um, uh, excuse me? Uh, I th... I think that you're in the wrong room. I'm in the right room. How did you even get in here? Okay. Can you please go out into the hall - so I can get dressed? - Don't flatter yourself. I'm not looking. You took your time. There they are. Hey, Tessa. Hi. Uh... Can you please ask your boyfriend to leave so I can get dressed? Uh, not my boyfriend. What did you say to her? Nothing. I've been minding my own business. Okay, well, whoever he is... You're going out with us tonight. Yeah, I don't know. I'm trying to picture this one at a party. Just not seeing it. You're not gonna stay in here forever, right? Nope. The Great Gatsby. It's a good book. I'd hate to spoil it... but it was all a dream. Actually... it was all a lie. Hello. Can I get, um, a cappuccino with almond milk and cinnamon on top? - Sure thing. - I'll have a regular black coffee, please. - And for you? - Can I have an Americano, please? No prob. - Thanks. - Ooh, such a player. - Now pick it up. Nicely. - Thank you. You're picking us all up, right, Zed? - When am I picking you guys up tonight? - I don't know, 8:00? We're raging tonight! - Guess what. - Shh! We're gonna go to a party tonight. I don't know. You're going. Don't you want to have fun? Shh! You shh. Yeah, of course I do. - Then grab your shit. - Steph. - Okay. - Let's get ready to party! What do you think? What? It's... It's pretty. Maybe it's just... a little too formal? You said be myself. You know what? I love it. I love it. Oh, this is gonna get crazy. - Hey! - Hey, what's up? Chug, chug, chug! Ooh, chug, chug, chug. There's my baby. Hey. Hey, I'm not done. - Hi, Tessa. - Hi. I need things to be way less in focus. Do that again, do it again. Do it again? I'm dying over here. I've lost my touch. Hey, guys. This is my new roommate, Tessa. This is everybody. Oh! Nice to meet you. - My name is Zed. - You've met Hardin. - That's Molly. - Hey. Wanna sit down? Cute dress. Oh, yeah, and that's Jace, the townie. What's up? What's your major, Tessa? I'm thinking business or maybe economics. Very cool. You want a drink? I don't really drink. Come on, we're all drinking. Just have a drink. - Do it. Come on. - Just a small one. Oh, my God, Steph, where'd you find this girl? No one's talking to you. Oh! Yes! That was good. Babe, kiss. - Cheers to that. - You okay? Oh, babe. Oh, baby. You're so pretty. Okay, so, um, guys... truth or dare. - What? - Truth or dare. - No, no! - Come on. Isn't this a kids' game? Not the way we play. Hey, Tessa, truth or dare? Truth. Craziest place you've had sex? Um... Pass. Why? It's an easy one. Wait. Are you a virgin? I'll do a dare. - Dare. - All right. I dare you to make out with Hardin. She won't do it. This never ends well. Do you want to do this? You having fun, Molly? I'm done playing this game. - Oh! - Ooh! Sucks to suck! - Oh! - I like this girl. Hardin Scott got his first rejection. Denied, bro. - Hey. - Hey. Thought we were gonna FaceTime. Yeah, sorry. Where are you right now? It's really loud. Um... I'm with Steph and her friends, but they're all just, like... - I don't know. - So, uh, you're at a party? - Have you been drinking? - I just had one drink. Okay, so you go to college and now you drink. That's... That's really great, Tessa. Noah, can you not be so, like... So, like, what? I'm not the one who's out partying right now. - Just forget it. - Tessa, I wanna... Oh. My bad. - What are you doing? - Hmm? Nothing. You looking for something? Are you drunk? I don't drink. Just like you don't. "He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of... his and mine are the same." It's Brontë, Theresa. I know it's Brontë. And my name is Tessa. What are you doing in my room, Tessa? Your room? Yes. Are we still playing? 'Cause I think you owe me a dare. Wa... Wait. I can't. I need to go. I've got this. Look, look, look. Here we go. Ready? - Oh! - Good shot, right? All right, all right. - Hi. - Hey. I'm glad I'm not the only freshman in this class. - Yeah. I'm psyched I got in. - Yeah. All right, folks. Let's get started. Jane Austen's masterpiece. Who in here has already read Pride and Prejudice? And what did you think of it on the first read? Let's hear from our newcomer, Mr. Scott. Pride and Prejudice? Elizabeth Bennet needs to chill. She gave Darcy a way worse time than he deserved. Are you saying that Darcy was not in love with Elizabeth? Love is just a transaction. We're all hardwired to desire. We present the correct set of desirable traits, and boom. We can turn it on and we can turn it off. - Yes, Miss, um... - Young, Tessa. I think that it was the most revolutionary feminist novel that I'd ever read. That a woman of that era would have the strength to reject Darcy - when he treated her poorly... - That's a load. It was Darcy's very attitude that attracted Elizabeth to him. Darcy's attitude was rude and mocking. I think he was lucky to be with a woman with as much integrity as Elizabeth. The only reason he even asked her to marry him - was she wouldn't stop throwing herself... - Throwing herself at him? - He was pursuing her. - She's clearly not satisfied with her life and is looking for excitement wherever she can get it. Well, I think that it's obviously all in his head that she had any feelings for him at all. Well... there you have it. That's the power of a good book. That was exciting. No, it was annoying. - I enjoyed it. - Look, whatever you're thinking, don't. Nothing happened between us, okay? I have a boyfriend. Us? I thought we were talking about Pride and Prejudice. Hey, uh... Do you want to go get some coffee? How can someone be so arrogant? Oh. "Elizabeth Bennet needs to chill." Like, who even... Who even says that? That's just Hardin being Hardin. - You know him? - Yeah. We're, uh... We're practically related. My mom is dating Chancellor Scott. Chancellor Scott is Hardin's dad. And Hardin and I, we tolerate each other but barely. His father's the chancellor? Yeah. Listen, Tessa, he's just trying to get a reaction. Well, he's not gonna get one from me. Hmm. It actually does hurt. You should get one. My mom would literally kill me. You need to get this. I bet she'd love that one. Yeah, dice. I feel like my mom has everything planned out for me. Like, I think she's been planning my wedding to Noah since we were five. Wait, is Noah the only dude you've ever gone out with? That's sad. Ooh! Ow! Watch it. Yeah, you guys really aren't selling me on this. Shh. You look so good tonight. Shh. Can I get a small coffee, please? Here you go. Yeah. Thanks. Hi. Hi. I can't stay away from you. What? Well, we're gonna see each other. I'm friends with Steph, and you're roommates. Tessa, let's just start over. - Just reset, and we can be... - What, friends? Well, why not? I want to show you something. So, show me, then. It's a... It's a place. I think that it's better if we... keep our distance. I'll see you around. It's down this way. Come on. Welcome to my favorite place. It's beautiful. - How about a swim? - Hmm? What are... - What are you doing? - I'm going swimming. Hardin. Hardin. Come in. You can wear my T-shirt. It feels amazing. A little privacy? Please? Okay. What? I like it better on you. Oh! Can I ask you something? Do I even have a choice? Who do you love the most in the whole world? Easy. Myself. Of course you do. What's your boyfriend's name? It's Noah. Noah. Does he go here? He's in high school. High school? And what does a high school kid do to deserve you? He is nice to me. Nice. Isn't that just another word for boring? Not always. Can I show you something? Hold your breath. The silence. It's peaceful. You think that's weird. No. Not at all. I thought that you just wanted to be friends. I don't think we can ever be just friends. Have you never been touched before? Why did you stop? We've got time. So, why do you call them chips? - Why do you call them fries? - 'Cause they're fried. They're not French. You've got plenty there! Um, I ordered mine without ketchup. - Oh, right. I'll be right back. - Thank you. No ketchup. That's very un-American. I'm full of surprises. So, what's your story then? My story? Yeah. Like your... your family, how you ended up here. I'll pass. I just don't think asking a bunch of arbitrary questions about someone's past is really going to tell you who they are. I can find out who you are by sitting here and spending time with you. What? What? What are you doing? I'm just waiting for you to reveal your true self to me by just sitting here and spending time with you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Okay, fair enough. One question. Um... Why do you have all those romance novels if you don't believe in love? Who says I don't believe in love? You did, in Soto's class. True. Maybe don't believe everything I say, then. Oh, hey, guys. Hey, Tessa. Guys. Let's just hang out for a minute. So, what have you two been up to? - We were just, um... - We're just getting some food. Oh, how's the boyfriend, Tess? We're leaving. Perfect. I need a ride. It's not a good time. You can ask Zed for a ride. Dude, we literally just got here. - Excuse me. - You're excused. All right. Tessa? Really? Yes. I won't be long. I'll be at the bar. See you around. - What's up, bro? - So, fill us in. - What was that? - What was what? Were you, like, embarrassed that they saw us together? No. You know, I am going to tell Noah about us, I just... Us? What do you mean, "us"? If you want to dump Mr. High School then go ahead, but don't do it on my account. What? Look, it was fun, but I don't date. Are you actually kidding me? You're here. What are you dreaming about? Surprise! What? What are you... What are you doing here? Mm. How are you? Thank you. You okay? Yeah! No, yeah, yeah, of course. - Okay. Yeah. - Thank you. So, what are we gonna do? Hey, it's Tess. - What's up, Tessa? - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. We... I think we met at the dorm. - So, he does exist. - Nice to meet you. - What's up, man? It's Zed. How's it going? - Good. How you doing? Cool. Campfire. Tessa. - Here you go. - Thanks. The cops will probably be here soon, so... Oh. Should we... Should we get out of here? Hey, Tessa. Didn't expect to see you here. So, how about we play a game of suck and blow? Suck and blow. I'm down. Okay, I got it. - Yes. - Aw. - Guess you know what that means. - Uh... - No, no, I'm... - Dude, dude, dude. Dude, don't go there, all right? Chill out, man, it's just a game. Hey, man, she doesn't have to. - Relax. - Okay, relax. - No, no. - No, I'm... Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Get off! You're gonna regret this. Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing, man? - Hardin. Hardin. - Hardin. Hey. Thanks for coming. What happened? Uh... Well, it started about his father and then your name sort of came up. He won't talk to me, so... I figured maybe he would talk to you. Where is he? What are you doing here? I was worried about you. Shouldn't you be with your perfect little boyfriend, Theresa? Don't bring Noah into this. I thought you didn't drink. I don't. I didn't. What does it matter? You made a real mess in there. I was celebrating. Didn't you hear? Dear old Dad is getting married. You should see the dump my poor mum lives in back in London. Don't you feel like you've had enough? Don't. I can get it. Ah! Damn it. Come with me. I'm sorry for how I treated you. Um... If... If you don't date, if that's how you feel... I don't think that is how I feel anymore. I'm a mess. I think that we're both a mess. You don't ever have to cover up, not for me. Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. Where were you? I texted you, you didn't answer me. I'm sorry, my... - My phone died, I'm sorry. - Where were you? Uh, a friend needed my help. In the middle of the night? Noah, I can explain. Can we... Please, can we just... can we just go inside and talk? I... Noah. I don't believe this. No, Noah. Noah, wait. Noah, I'm... I'm confused. I wanted to talk to you about it for a while. I am so, so sorry. Noah. Tessa. Go home, Hardin. Noah and I just... broke up. I feel like I just lost my best friend. Come over here. Come on. I didn't expect to see you. When my dad left... I was ten. He left us with nothing. And my mom, she just... sort of fell apart. I had to take care of her alone. But... Noah was there for me, you know? I hate myself for what I did to him. Tessa, it's not your fault. Yeah, it is. Noah is my best friend. But you... you're so much more. Library's closing. Library's getting ready to close. Library is closing. - Follow me. - Hmm? - Come on. - What are... Down here. "You could draw me to fire, you could draw me to water, you could draw me to the gallows, you could draw me to any death, you could draw me to anything I have most avoided. This and the confusion of my thoughts, so that I am fit for nothing, is what I mean by your being the ruin of me." Why'd you stop? We should go. Hey! What are you doing here? Stop! And perhaps the most mesmerizing of all systems is the binary star phenomenon. Two stars find their way across vast stretches of space and time to find another wandering body and become attached for eternity in each other's orbit, each star pushing the other to explode in supernova. Becoming either the nucleus of a planetary nebula or, just as often, resulting in the death spiral... What are you doing, Tessa? Learning about the stars? The stars assist in each other's destruction. Do you have any idea how beautiful you are right now? What are you always writing in there? None of your business. Show me. No. - Come on. - Not a chance. I just want to see what's... Tessa, hon? I've called all day... - Tessa? - Mom? What are you doing here? What the hell is going on? - Nothing. - Who's he? - Is he the guy Noah told me about? - I... So this is how you spend your time, instead of going to class? - No! - I think I should go. You think? Can we talk about this outside? Please? Please? You, go. Come with me. You have got to be kidding me. I knew as soon as I saw that roommate that something like this would happen. Are you serious right now? I mean, and after all this work and you are going to throw it away for some boy. What are you talking about? I'm not. You're going to break up with this boy and you are going to focus on your schoolwork. Do you even know what it has been like, trying to be perfect for you? Having you mold my life into the way that you wanted it to be? I did it for your own good. I am so, so sorry, Mom, that your life didn't work out the way that you wanted it to, I really am. But this is my life and you have to let me live it. Is that really what you want? Yes. If I leave now... you're cut off. He's gonna break your heart. She's cutting you off because of Hardin? I'm just a little worried, is all. Why? Hardin is... Hardin is complicated. Yeah, I know, but... he's different around me. Just be careful. You okay? Yeah. Where have you been? Jump in and I'll show you. - You ready? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes! Whose place is this? Friend of my father's. A professor. Where are they? She's in Italy. All year. I'm meant to be watering the plants. Ooh! She paints. It's really nice. Imagine if it were our place. Sure. It can be. What, you mean like... live together? When you told me your mum was going to cut you off, I had to do something. We can stay here for the rest of the year. Just you and me. You did this for me? - Here. - Mm-hmm. You're gonna bring out the best in others. Oh! Check out that one. It looks a bit like you. This is crazy. I still can't believe it. Hmm? Believe what? That you're mine. Not this again. I don't deserve you. Nothing... could ever change the way that I feel about you. I cannot believe you've talked me into this. It's a wedding reception, it's not a jail sentence. Hey. - Hey. You guys made it. - Yeah. - You look beautiful, Tessa. - Oh, thank you. You clean up well, man. This is so fancy. Yeah, it's beautiful. So we're brothers. Yep. You must be really happy for your mom and Ken. Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'll see you two in there. This looks so good. Look who's here. It's good to see you. - You too. - And you must be... - Tessa. - Tessa. - I'm Karen. I'm Landon's mom. - Hi. It's so nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. It means a lot to me that you could be here. Congratulations. Thanks for coming. I'm happy you decided to join us, son. Landon tells us you're in Professor Soto's seminar. - Yeah. - So, you're an English major? Um, I... I would love to, but I think if I want to be employed, maybe business or econ. If you're interested in the business side of literature, my friend owns a publishing company. - You mean Vance? - Yes. - I can call Vance for her. - Of course. I'm sure he'd be happy to hear from you. Ken... Dean has arrived. Come on, I think we should go say hi. Enjoy. - Nice meeting you. - Yeah, you too. Let's just have fun. I can't. Why not? You made me promise to be on my best behavior. Thank you all for coming. Tonight we celebrate great good fortune. And her name is Karen. The love of my life, and... And frankly, she saved my life. I'm suddenly blessed by a new bride, a new life, and not one but two brilliant sons. Hardin... and Landon. I remember an earlier time, when my greatest pleasure was to listen to Hardin, who loved to recite passages from novels, all by memory. And he would perform them, leaving me with tears... That's not the man I grew up with. ...or laughter... - My father was a drunk. - ...or sometimes both. And nothing more. - I don't think he had any idea... - At least he's trying. ...just how important those moments were to me. Which is more than my father ever did. - People change. - Clearly. This doesn't change what happened. What happened? One night, when I was eight... My dad was at the pub. Drunk, as usual. He messed with the wrong guys. They came to our house for payback. He wasn't there. They found my mum instead. I tried... I tried to fight them off, but I couldn't. Thank you, my friends... family... - And that's my dad. - ...and university faculty. The beloved Chancellor Scott. Let's have fun. I don't suppose you recall any of those passages. Not the way you remember it. I would love to have a dance with your brilliant son. I want you now. Are you sure? Yeah. Do you want me to stop? No. Just go slow. - Car. - It was "cat." Do another one. Uh... That one is... - I have no idea. - I'm really good at this. Yeah. Okay, just do one more. I promise I'll get it. Um... Um... Mm... I don't know. What was it? I'm probably gonna stay up, finish it up. I'm gonna stay up late and work on that. - And then I'll... I'll text you. - I'll just see you. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? I haven't seen you since, like, the bonfire. Yeah. I've been busy... I guess. How's it going with you and your boyfriend? Uh, we're not together anymore. Ouch. Bye-bye, high school. Yeah, it was pretty painful. I can tell you moved on pretty quickly. - How's Hardin? - What do you mean? He told me you guys have been hanging out. Yeah. We have. Cool. Really? Yeah. I mean, Hardin does what Hardin does. What's wrong? What's all this about? What didn't you tell me? Nothing. I don't know what she's talking about. - You don't know what she's talking about? - I mean, I don't know. - What didn't you tell me? - Nothing! - I need to go. - What? Now? Hardin, answer me. - Where are you going? - Out. What's going on? - Do you trust me? - Of course I do. Then what's the problem? What are you doing in Hardin's car? What, I can't borrow his car? Jace, just tell me where he is. Maybe he's at Blind Bob's. Oh, my gosh, hey! What's the matter? - Are you okay? - Yeah. You want some fries? Are you hungry? I haven't seen you since you moved out. Um... I've been living with Hardin off campus. Wait. - You two are living together? - Yeah. Wow, Tessa. I didn't know you two were that serious. Yeah, we are. How long has this been going on for and... - Look who I found. - Oh, hey, Jace. Hey, Hardin. What's up? What's up, Tessa? I got you. Tessa. Hi, Hardin. Tessa was just telling us the latest. Tessa's been filling us in on all the details. - Moving in together. - And you guys are so adorable. Is there anything you want to tell Tessa? Yeah, like what's been going on between you and her? - Nothing's going on with me and her... - I don't believe you. What have you said? - Tessa, I swear... - I saw the texts that she sent you. They didn't mean anything. I didn't even reply to them. - They meant nothing. - Oh, you got to be kidding me. Tessa, nothing's going on. Don't you think this thing has gone a little too far? What thing, Hardin? Something's going on... but it's not what you think. Molly, shut up. Tessa... Let's get out of here, and I'll explain. I'll explain everything, I promise. Remember truth or dare? What? Molly, don't. Molly! I'm done playing this game. - Oh! - I like this girl. Looks like Hardin Scott just got his first rejection. You lot don't think I could make it happen? Make what happen, Hardin? Here's a dare. Make her fall in love with me. And then... I'll just... turn it off. It was all a game. Tessa? Tessa. Tessa, please. You have to believe me. Tessa, that was before everything. Before I got to know you. Is that true? And all of you knew? Tessa. Tessa, wait. Tessa, wait. - Tessa. - So what exactly did you tell them, then? Nothing. None of it was real. I actually thought... I thought that... You're just a liar. - That was all before. - Before what? - Before... - You snapped your fingers, turned it off? You said nothing could change the way you felt about me. Then I guess we're both liars. Hi, Mom. What happened? I don't really... want to talk about it. I just... I came here to say... that I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry too. I love you. So how come you're back? I just needed to come home. I'm so sorry, Noah. I never meant to hurt you. Yeah, I know. I guess I just never saw... any of this coming. Yeah, but... that's, like, the point, right? We, like... We change and we discover who we are. I think that's okay. Yeah? Yeah. On a parting note, I was deeply impressed by all of your papers attacking our themes for this semester. Congratulations on all of your good work. Good job. Ms. Young. This is what Hardin turned in. I think it was actually written more for you than it was for me. Thank you. What is that? Um... A secret spot. And a good place to think. "I've read hundreds of novels in my life, most of them claiming that love was the center of the universe. That it could heal any damage inside of us, that it was what we need to survive. From Darcy to Heathcliff, I thought they were fools. That love was something fictional, only found in worn pages of a book. But that has all changed since I met my Elizabeth Bennet. I never thought I would find myself completely and utterly consumed by another until her. She took my hand and led me out of the darkness and showed me that whatever our souls are made of... hers and mine are the same. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. You once asked who I loved most in this world. It's you." Subtitles by explosiveskull
