(slow dramatic orchestral music) (bird squawking) - [Narrator] Only Sor, the blind prophet, truly believed that nightfall was coming to destroy the perpetual sunlight of our planet. We rejected the prophecies of darkness. We had seen clouds and we had walked in the shadows, but we never lived without suns. Aton, the astronomer and master of our city, believed the suns were eternal in their orbits. Ours is a planet of light, he would say proudly. None-the-less, there were signs of disturbance. In the city, Sor's predictions were changing peoples lives. Aton himself became obsessed with a mysterious woman who walked out of the desert and into his life. He lost interest in his work with the great telescope. He neglected his friends and he forgot his duties. He put Sor out of his mind, his own assistant becoming uneasy, listened for clues to the disturbance in the atmosphere. While Aton slept and dreamed, the prophet waited and worked. (crumbling) - It's a hole, it's a hole. (bird squawking) (thumping) (dramatic orchestral music) (thumping) (thumping faster) - There's two of them. (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh yes. They died together. They could not face the darkness. That was before the eighth nightfall. Here, here. Here it is. The proof. (crumbling) (gasping) - Are you spying on us? Tell Aton, we have found the proof of the Book of Illuminations. - Sor, what will Aton do? - Nothing, nothing. He is a weak man. In the face of disaster, he thinks only of his flesh. (people talking) - [Woman] Aton, look at this. - Not now. - Please, it's important, just listen. - Yes, yes, another time. - It's amazing! It may be too late, Aton. Maybe this is telling us something. - Give it to me, I'll look at it. - You don't look at it, you listen to it! (wind chimes ringing) (frustrated sighing) (birds chirping) (calming orchestral music) - I brought you something. A gift. It's for you. Be careful. - [Ana] Is it a game? How do I play it? - Ana, it's not a toy. It might break. - You gave it to me. - Yes, I know. (splashing) (cheerful bell music) (humming) (applauding) - That was beautiful. - It's music for three suns in time. Hey! Could you hear it up there? What do you think? - What are they doing over there? - Well, they're trying to prove their prophecy about the end of light, the end of our planet, the end of life. (energetic percussion music) (sighing) - Who are you? Where do you come from? - Out there. You always ask me that. - You're mine now. (sighing) (grunting) - What's wrong? (pained breathing) - It'll pass. When I was a child, I had very poor eyesight. I used to have blackouts. Everything would turn dark red. Later as I began to study the suns and their motions, my eyesight improved. Saved by science. - Oh your science. It's all made up, like a story, like a song. - Sing to me. (humming softly) (tapping) - Bet. Bet. Bet, what's the matter? - I can't get that woman out of my mind. - Why are you so jealous of him? - Jealous? What are you talking about? Jealous of my own father? - Bet, remember, Roa left him, he didn't leave her. And knowing your mother, I'm not surprised she ran off with those people. - What are you trying to say? - I think your mother needs looking after. - Is that what you think, that I'm like my mother? - Aton, there's still time. Join us. Together we can face it. - Face what? - The darkness. - You left, Roa. - I led the way. - You joined these people. - I needed faith, something to believe in. - And I loved you. - Passion wasn't enough. - I can feel the empty space now, near the side of our suns, dark, cold, black. (shivering) I've already started to feel it in the wind. Can't you tell, Zol, the wind is turning? - Something's wrong. Their building patterns are changing. The shapes are becoming irregular. - It must have something to do with the atmosphere, maybe because it's been colder lately. - So, nightfall is approaching and when the darkness comes, we will be swallowed up in a great cave. Those with plain blind faith, the believers will survive and see. We will witness the night, nightfall, total darkness. Aton's woman. (mysterious orchestral music) - That creature, she's like a ghost in this city. - Yeah, she will bring about the death of someone. (slow calming orchestral music) (light breeze blowing) (bird squawking) (horse whinnying) - Do you believe in the prophecies? You believe there will be a world without light? - You've seen the bodies in the temple. Perhaps Sol faked them. He's capable of it. Two skeletons from anywhere? The power of a prophecy has nothing to do with whether it's true or false. It's a question of whether people believe it or not. Look at the natives. They're going back to the range in superstitions. You know they believe in reincarnation? - I believe there are other beings inside all of us. Look at Aton. He's not one person. He's three or four people. (calming orchestral music) (people talking) (slow drumming) (sloshing) - Tell Aton to come and see for himself. Get him away from that evil spirit. (slow drumming) It is not too late to join us. Our drums are more powerful than your bells and when the darkness comes, it is we who will prevail. - Sor is becoming dangerous. The people are getting nervous. They need reassurance from you. - Listen to her. (soft humming) Go home. Compose something for her on those journey bells of yours. - I'm talking about nightfall. Can't you see it? - What's the matter with you? - It's not just Sor. Our own people want to get rid of her. - She doesn't know who Sor is. Now go home. Make something for her. - [Kin] Who is she? What does she see? What does she want? - Nothing. Everybody wants something from me, but her. - You're the father that I never knew. I'm only trying to protect you. You used to listen to me. - No, I've listened enough. Given enough. I want something for myself. - Aton, she won't help you. (dramatic orchestral music) (screaming) - Aton! Aton! Aton (crying) Aton. (people reacting) - She's finally gone. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Man] Now she's gone. He'll pay attention to his responsibilities. - [Man] I'm uneasy. - You can't soften now. It had to be done. (horse whinnying) He'll forget her, like a bad dream. - [Man] I'm not so sure. - Where is she? What have they done with her? - She was using you. She was-- - Where's my light? (somber orchestral music) (horse whinnying) (panting) - It's all here, isn't it? Isn't it? Why didn't you stop them? - What could we do? - Whose side are you on? - What sides? What are you talking about? - I'm talking about him, that blind man is eating into my life. (bird squawking) (soft orchestral music) (soft breeze blowing) - So, are you worried yet? - Get out. - Anger. You know how welcome you always are, how wanted in the Temple of Illumination. - What do you really want? What are you after? - After, after, after? Nothing, I'm not after. I am before. Before the darkness. What would you say if I told you that one sun, and then the other-- - This is a city of light. - And then the third sun will disappear and not come back again. - We exist in the light. Our suns are our life. - This nightfall will be the ninth nightfall and the darkest one of them all. - Could he be right? Could it have just vanished? (rattling) What's that noise? What are you doing? - I'm tracking the dark sun. - Darkness is a state of mind. Believe in what you discover. (panicking) - How? - I send out a certain impulse which bounces back. (rattling) - Let me see. - There's nothing to see. It's all sound. A telescope for the blind. (dramatic orchestral music) (chanting) - Light this. - There's a pattern to it. Like the bells. - Or the drums. (chanting) (dramatic orchestral music) (shivering) - Oh, it's cold. (blasting) Oh. The darkness. Oh. (blasting) Oh. (shivering) - What do you see? - Flames. The darkness, the madness of the people. - And in the sky? The sky? - Nothing. Nothing. - I won't leave the dwarf sun goes. Will we know if Sor's right? - I can feel it, Aton. There's something changing beyond our suns. - The first sun has gone. - So, nightfall has begun. - Then Roa must be elevated, the time's now. - Is that necessary? - Are you jealous, Zor? - No, of course not. - Belief will need leaders in the coming darkness. The belief will grow in the coming darkness. It will need leaders as well as followers. This woman will be a leader. (chimes ringing) - What happened? Where is the dark sun? - It's gone. The nightfall has begun. (birds squawking) (dramatic orchestral music) (birds squawking) (chanting) (dramatic orchestral music) (screaming) (thunder cracking) (birds squawking) (slow dramatic orchestral music) (humming) ♪ As it is written in the Book of Illuminations, ♪ ♪ the blind shall see and the sighted will be retrained. ♪ - [Ana] Oh your science, it's all made up, like a story, like a song. (humming) - Kin. Kin, I want her back. I can't stop thinking about her. Over and over again, I can't get her out of my mind. - It's too late, it's past-- - It's not too late. Find her. - Oh, where is she? - Find her. I want her back before the darkness. - Supposing she doesn't come with me? - She will come with you. She has no home. And she loves me. - [Kin] What if she doesn't want to come back with me? - Don't argue with me. You owe this to me. I've given you a great deal. - How will I find her? - She's a nomad, she'll be with 'em in the far country. Don't come back without her. (rattling) - Please don't go. Please. - I have to. (people talking) - Is love blind? What was Aton's passion like? When you were together like this? What did he say to you? - He said, I want you so much, I can't even tell if I love you. I don't care. Through the flesh, I want something beyond the mind. Then we talked about our planet and our suns and whether there were other planets beyond our suns. - Do to me what you did to him. Do it. (slow orchestral music) (groaning) (sighing) (chimes ringing) (dramatic orchestral music) - How's it coming? - The main problem will be installation. We have the volume. You can see here how each area interconnects so that there's a continuum. In the darkness, people will surely want to be close together. - Wait, I recognize these. These are the designs for the original laboratory. - Your grandfather's father obviously prepared for the nightfall. Just look at the models he made. Must have been quite a visionary. Just dreams of course, never be built. - If only I could have my grandfather's sense of vision. - Strange isn't it? What this nightfall does to you. I realize now, I'm not a great architect. Efficient with second hand ideas, that's me. I'm not sure I can execute these plans. - Don't underestimate yourself. That's exactly what they'd like. Soul (inaudible) is the death of the planet and if you believe that, then you will die. - Well, well, that sun will never return. Now, you have proof of course. He's discovered it. What we've always known from the book. - Yes, where is this amazing book? I'd like to see it. - You're welcome. You're always welcome. But only the blind can read it. - Well that's convenient, isn't it? - Accept the inevitable. Loss is inevitable. All of us will be losing something. - More predictions. - Soon you'll be alone in the darkness. Then you'll come looking for me, but I won't be able to help you then. - What is it you do to people? You convince them that what has happened has been written in your book, that it was inevitable. And they're frightened. They're frightened of the future, because you were able to convince them that the future is written there as well. - Aton, you are clever and so sometimes you can half see. - Yes, that's what you do. - But what do you want? For yourself? - I want to create, discover. - I don't think you've discovered anything except a few sensations of the flesh and the smartness of alcohol. You're at the end of the line. (people talking) - [Man] Move along, hurry. - We are facing a great crisis in our lives, in our civilization. I've discovered that the prophecy of the coming nightfall has a basis in scientific fact. The dark sun has left the sky and will not return, not for a while. And after that, the light sun will vanish as well. Now listen to me. - At nightfall, there will be a new beginning. - We can do nothing to prevent this, but we can prepare for it. Sor and his people are praying that we will panic and that is not what is going to happen. - There will be destruction and madness and those without belief will suffer. - We will build ourselves an underground keep to protect ourselves from the coming darkness. - Do you understand, this city will be yours. (chanting) - [Man] How long is the nightfall? - I do not know. But I do know one thing, the suns do not die. They merely move, their orbits shift and they will return. - Oh. - And we will wait, just as our ancestors must have waited. We will work together and we will survive. - The faithful will survive. The faithful will survive. - The faithful will survive together. Now let us begin. (group agreeing) - Faith, faith, and again, the faithful. (chanting) (tapping) - I'll support you, but don't take that creature back. I hope Kin never finds her. (birds squawking) (energetic orchestral music) (humming) (cheerful flute and tambourine music) - Who are you? - You don't recognize me? You must know who I am. I'm Aton's son in-- - You never spoke to me. You looked at me a thousand times, but you never spoke to me, not once. And when they took me away, you didn't do anything to stop them. So why are you here? - He needs you. - Then why didn't he come himself? - He is working to protect us from the nightfall. - Nightfall, what do you fear about nightfall? Everything comes to an end. Look at them. We believe in the present. To us there's no past, no future, it's all one time. (flame crackling) (horse whinnying) The future is behind us, the past is what's ahead. (horse whinnying) - So are you coming back with me? Or are you going with them? - You don't understand. I've already left. (flames crackling) - [Man] These are much better. - Here you go. Two more now, come. Move over, come on. (creaking) - Aton, the dwarf sun is going. (rattling) - The second sun, the second sun, the second-- (thumping) The second sun is going. Here. Here, here, can you read it? Can you feel the words? You'll have to learn. It'll come, it'll come. (laughing) (teasing) (laughing) (growling) (humming) (cheerful orchestral music) (sheep baaing) (people talking) (twinkling) - I wonder if we can find a way to use these somehow. - They're so beautiful. - [Aton] Look at them, the energy. They're almost alive. (monkey chattering) - What are they doing? What are they doing? - They're trading pieces of quartz for fruit and vegetables. - They trading. The planet's dying, nightfall's coming, they're trading for a future they haven't got, they're trading. (bell ringing) - [Aton] One bell, one kite. - These belong to Kin. - We need them to trade. He'll understand. - Aton, you can't go on destroy-- - Our survival is what's at stake here. Understand that. We'll use anything, anything that works. - Not anything. I'm beginning to understand why Roa left you. You're just like Sor. You talk about survival, all you want is power. - [Man] Three bells, one kite. - [Aton] Done. (screaming) (groaning) (birds chirping) (hissing) (dramatic orchestral music) (gasping) (screaming) (hissing) (spitting) (screaming) (spitting) (spitting) - Shh. Look at her. She is wise. She sees everything. She never sleeps and when she blinks, she dreams. (flapping) (twinkling music) (people talking quietly) - [Aton] Incredible. They are useful. - What do you think? - What do I think? (screaming) - [Roa] No! - You're going back! I'm taking you back. I'm taking you back before nightfall! Listen, I have a responsibility towards Aton. I came to get you for him. - You are lying! You are lying and you're weak. Lying and weak. - No. I came to get you for him! (splashing) - [Roa] No! - You think that I am weak, huh? Look at me, I'm weak. If I'm so weak, how come you want me? - Your nightfall, it means nothing, it means nothing. - This snake, you keep calling it a her. How do you know it's female? (whacking) (screaming) (groaning) (gasping) - Take me back. I'll go to him. But I want you now. Now, or I won't go. - Roa? - Aton? Aton? - [Woman] Look, it's her. - What have they done to you? - Oh, I've longed for this for so long. I wish you could have been there. I can see so clearly now. I was so confused before, but blindness is so necessary. You must see that, you and Bet. Oh, I worry about Bet and you-- - [Aton] Shh. - Oh, you're shaking. You're afraid, oh poor Aton. Maybe you'll come with us, hm? We are going to go on to such great things. (flapping) (chimes ringing) (clipping) (birds chirping) (thumping) (screaming) - Get him, now while he's asleep. - [Man] And if the believers try to stop us? - Get him. (people talking) - [Man] Come with us. - Oh, wait, wait. - [Man] You're under arrest. - Why are you taking him? - Being arrested? - [Man] Aton is waiting. - Go, go! (birds chirping) - Why, why did you have the chords cut? - I did not have the cords cut. - What are you afraid of? - Nothing. - Take him. - Oh no, Aton, this is a mistake. - No, this is not a mistake. - This is not written. This is not in the book. - You really think you are written in your book? - I am the interpreter of the book. - And I am the interpreter of my city. Go. Don't worry, we'll leave you your visions. - You've seen Roa. - Yes. - She will be with me at nightfall and you will probably be destroyed by this. - Perhaps. But not by you. (drumming) (chanting) (clanking) (birds chirping) - When I take away my hands, you will see clearly what you must do. (humming) Keep this with you. You will be told when to use it. Now you can return to your people. Remember, this is what you want. You can only be free after you've done it. - What's the matter with them? (buzzing) (humming) (walking hooves) (chimes ringing) - You did find her! Oh, oh. - I did. She's here. - Why? (woman laughing in the distance) (slow soft orchestral music) (birds chirping) - A long time ago, I was a snake princess who fell in love with a golden bird. She loved to hear his song and the way he cried out at night, but she could neither understand nor speak its language. And the princess went to go see a wise old snake to ask him for the secret of understanding the language of the bird. He told her that the secret was hidden in the liver of a snake and only by eating it could she gain this knowledge. I could never kill one of my kind, said the princess. Then you must eat your own liver, said the old snake. But I will die, said the princess. You will not die, whispered the old snake, but you will lose your snakeskin and be transformed into a woman princess for the rest of your life. (birds squawking) The princess heard the golden bird cry out and she was so overwhelmed with love for him that she cut open her side and swallowed her own liver. Instantly her snakeskin fell away and she became a woman and for the first time, she understood the song of the golden bird. And she realized that this song that so enchanted her was really a love song he was singing to his wife. The princess lived for a very long time alone. She longed to go back to her snake people, but now they were afraid of her because she had become a woman and they no longer understood her language. Desire had caught the snake princess by the tail. She had given up everything for a passion that could never be hers. - Aton, you should have left Sor alone. His influence is growing. You can feel it on the street. People are saying that you imprisoned him out of revenge. - Our people are saying buzz like bees. What's the matter with you? - Don't get angry with me. - Go back to the keep. Angry, you understand what's happening? We're under siege. When the light sun goes, we're on our own. - My assistant was wearing this. He's become one of them. (thumping footsteps) (dramatic slow music) (humming) (slow percussion music) (grunting) (thumping) (panting) (grunting) (slow suspenseful music) (humming) (chimes ringing) (thumping) (slow suspenseful music) (humming) (tired breathing) - [Sor] Oh, my friend, my friend, oh. Oh, my friends. Oh my friends. - What is it? - When I'm with you, when I close my eyes, I can feel the nightfall. It's the excitement in it, fear, of the unknown. My passion for you is part of that. Your eyes are so dark. You are my nightfall. (wind blowing) - We have several problems. - Yes, I know, there's not enough room. We'll fit them in, let huddle together. - Our people are going to be affected by the darkness. They're scared already. - Then we must reassure them. - [Man] There's a shortage in sleeping accommodations. - Let them sleep together, make love, be good for the morale. - If there's a high wind, we could lose the kites. If that happens, we lose power! - What the matter with you, with both of you? - We're telling you what might happen. - Might, might. - What happened to Aton the realist? - I was never a realist. I'm an optimist. - You're turning your back on the situation. - Yes, well you're back's always turned on something, isn't it? - You're impossible! - Nothing is impossible. - I want us to leave, now, together. - Leave, that's crazy. No, no. - Don't throw me on the street, then there'll be nothing to eat and we're going to kill each other for food. - Because there's been a way. You've gotten scared. - Oh please, Kin, before it's too late. - Calm down. Wherever we go, the darkness will be there. We won't escape it. Your father's right. Come. We're strong. We'll survive. - I don't believe him. If he's so strong, why does he need that woman? - Because she's extraordinary. - Extraordinary? Tell me about her. You've been with her for quite a while. What's she got? - He loves her. - Know what I think? You want to stay because of her. (groaning) (screaming) - [Man] This place is like a prison! I can't stay here forever! (screaming) When nightfall comes, we'll all die! - [Aton] We'll not die. - We are nothing, nothing! - [Aton] Invent something for panic. - Everything is in our heads. I believe we can do anything because we can imagine anything. (chimes ringing) (soft orchestral music) (birds chirping) - [Ana] I knew you'd come. - I was dreaming about you. Leave him now. - I can't, not now. - Yes you can. Come with me, we're leaving. - You'll leave your wife? - Yes, I will. - Someone might see us. - Do you care? (chimes ringing) - What is it? - I'm staying. - Why? - I belong here now. - Look at this, the orbit continues to shift, but precisely, rhythmically. - I'm listening. - That must mean that the dark sun is moving in exactly the opposite direction. It will return. - When the light goes, what happens to life, to the plants, to us? - Some will die. With the darkness will come another kind of energy. - [Ana] I want to be with them. - Why didn't you stay with your own people in the desert? - Because I wanted to be with you. - With me? Or with him? Why did you come back? To be with him? - It's not as clear as you want it to be. - Or did you come back to die? - Ana, Ana? - You are looking for Ana. I am looking for Kin. - What are you saying? - I hate this time. I hate this place. I hope we all die. (rhythmic drumming) - [Woman] Help me. (birds squawking) (rhythmic drumming) (wind blowing) (gonging) (slow mysterious orchestral music) (wind blowing) (birds squawking) - I had to pull in some of the kites. If this wind gets too strong, they'll be torn away. - The end is beautiful, isn't it? (chimes ringing) (gonging) (wind blowing) (gurgling ripples) - [Woman] Please, no, calm down. - It's all right. It's all right. Don't be frightened. (slow calming orchestral music) - Have you seen Ana? - I haven't. Come along. - Are you looking for Aton? He went to the keep. - Aren't you coming? - No, I want to see it from here. - I have to go. (chimes ringing) - Take it! (slow mysterious orchestral music) - Please, it's going to be all right, please. (people panicking) - It's going to be all right, isn't it? (chimes ringing) (wind blowing) - Ana! (people panicking) (chimes ringing) (wind gusting) (slow mysterious orchestral music) (chanting) - The city in flames. - Oh, I feel wonderful. - Everyone must join us. Go into the streets, bring them here. Take this. One night, the power will be yours. Everything is fueling up. And the beginning is near. (bird squawking) (energetic music) (people panicking) (cheerful dance music) - Come with me. - Too late. There's nowhere to go. - Then I'll stay here with you. (energetic dance music) (people panicking) (energetic dance music) (screaming) (groaning) (thunder clapping) (wind blowing) (chimes ringing) - Why? Why? - Cause it has to be. - What has to be? - We are in a dream, Aton. You, Ana, myself, all of us, we can't change the dream. It has to be. And when we wake, we die. It's simple. - Get a weapon. (thunder clapping) (chimes ringing) I don't know which of you to kill. (wind blowing) (clamoring) (grunting) (blasting) (grunting) (bells ringing) (splashing) (bells ringing) - No, no. (splashing) (grunting) (thunder clapping) (bells ringing) (groaning) (wind blowing) (bells ringing) (flames crackling) (grunting) (chimes ringing) (people panicking) (humming) (flames crackling) (chimes ringing) (people talking) - Oh. No. No. (humming) (humming) (screaming) (groaning) (rhythmic drumming) (chanting) - The real question is, how long will the darkness last? - How'd you get up here in the dark? - The darkness is relative. But you can't see that, can you? - Relative? The Book of Illuminations is the truth. Your planet is dying! Are you afraid? - Yes, I was afraid. You took our doubts and you turned them into fears and you frightened us with your visions. - Illuminations. - That time is at an end now, isn't it? Cause we will survive. With all our doubts, because without our doubts, we confront nothing, we create nothing-- - Telescopes and crystal sticks and kites! - Without doubt, there's no sense of purpose. There's no sense of direction. And where is your direction? Where is your direction now? (distant chanting) (baby crying) - Mother, is that you? - Bet, Bet? Oh, Bet. (crying) Why are you crying? This is a time for happiness. Oh, don't be afraid. Here, here, stop, come with me. The time has come. The sighted shall be led by the blind. (slow calming orchestral music) - It's beautiful. - Look at that. - [Woman] What is it? - We're still on the surface of things. All our history, our progress, are nothing. Is it possible that nothing important has yet been said or even understood. It's possible. (inspirational orchestral music) (rattling) (quiet ringing music) (quiet dramatic orchestral music)
