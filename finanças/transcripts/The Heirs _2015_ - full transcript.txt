No, Kennedy, this way! Come on! Come on! - Coyo! - What's up? - Ha ha, you should've seen your face... - Shut up, dumb ass. Oh yeah, of course you do. So, you'll do it? OK, but tell me how. - Pull him hard, he's very strong. - Yes he is. - If he goes too fast and you get scared... - Piece of cake. Crazy bastard. - Hello Gera! - What's up, Ruco? - Is that your dog? - No, it's his. - And how old is he? - One, one and a half. - It's a male, right? - Yeah. - Do you want to mate them? - Yeah, right. How? - I have a rottweiler too. - Really? Her name is Madonna, exactly like him. You're not chickening out, are you? - No, let's mate them. - Cool, dude, come on. - What, now? - Yeah, now, dude. What? You think they should date before? - OK, let's go. - Come, Kennedy, let's go! Get right in there. Make sure he lies on top of you, OK? - Where do you think you're going? - With you guys. - Who owns the dog? - He does. That's it then. Only the owner. That's the rule. Get in. - I guess we'd better leave them alone. - Right on. - You want a Coke or something? - Sure. In√©s! Will you bring us a Coke? I'm busy right now, your father has guests. This way, man. - Is that your dad? - Unfortunately. Rogelio. What are you doing? We are mating Madonna. Give me the cigarette. Aren't you ashamed your dog got laid before yourself? And you, aside from the fact you're even older than me. - Yeah, but it's your dog, not mine. - So what? Hey, check out what Ruco gave me earlier today. - Far out! - Should we light it? - Right on! - OK. God bless! Hey! Let's sit here. I'll go for the shade. Who's given a blow job? - Come on, raise your hands! - Don't be such liars! Raise your hands on three. One, two, three. Oh, come on! Nothing but girls? - What about me? - I was listening to you. I'm a virgin! I swear! If you get the tip in, you are not! The tip does count! No, no, no. It was just the tip. - That's what we're saying! - It was the tip and everything else! - It is never just the tip. - Unless it is that small. A real gentleman dips in just the tip. Yeah, real slow. - Ruco here... - Wants to make out with Erika. You fancy Erika? - No, I don't like her. - You fancy her. No. Yeah, right! You're so horny. There he goes... Ruco! - What? - Good luck. Hey. Hey. Hey, Ruco! They're so lame. He's not your boyfriend nor your lunch! Get your hands full while you can! I dig the peeping feeling! Hey guys! You can use my house. It's really close. Very close. Fucking Ruco. Picuy, Picuy. Dude, what's with your girl? He's stealing your girlfriend, man. You won't do anything? He wants to cry. He wants to cry. - What the fuck Picuy? - What's wrong with you? Raise his head. I'll get him some tissues. Oh, that looks awful. Unbelievable, fucking Picuy. - Oh God, it's bleeding more. - This is too much! Let's get him on his feet. Get him to the swings. - It hurts! - Give him space to breathe. Hold on, dude. Come in. I won't bite. - Where's Gera? - In the backyard. Wait, wait. Tell me how it happened. - He fell off the skateboard. - I know that, but how? - Kennedy was pulling him. - Why? I always do that. And nothing has ever happened to me. And that's how he broke his nose? Yeah, I didn't explain him well. So, when Kennedy pulled him hard... he fell and hit the ground. - Hi Ricky. - Hi Carlos. - How are you? - Fine. You? Thank you for the Christmas present. Look how you left my son. Yeah, thank you... Don't worry. It's OK. Have you met Sofi, my niece? - No. Hi! - Hello! - Do it right. 'Hi, my name is Ricky...' - Nice to meet you. I'm Ricardo. - Better call him Coyo. - Coyo? - Yes, Coyo. - Why Coyo? Because when he was a kid he would run away... when a girl got too close to him. I named him Coyo after that. Not true! You did that. At least I've had a girlfriend. - No, you haven't. - Really? Where is she? Well, it's not that interesting, it's just that in the end I wasn't into it and... I broke up with her and that's it. You broke up with her? Yes... well... Yeah, she was too grippy. But I don't even remember. It was a long time ago. How come I didn't know that story? I didn't consider it was worth telling. How old is she? Don't play fool. Don't you know her age? - Yeah, fifteen. - Oh, OK. And when will you see her again? Tomorrow? Don't know. You should wait three days and then call her. Right, now hit the brakes, carefully... And remember to always mind your mirrors, OK? You're doing fine. How do you feel? Fine, I guess. Then stay on your lane, kiddo. - You suck! - Your mother! I'm still on top, still on top! My score is highest. - Why are your hands shaking, Ruco? - He's always touching himself. Come on Coyo, shows us the money. The money? Try throwing two at the same time. - Right, now look. - Yes, like that! Come on, come on! Wait dude, wait... OK, I wont tell you the end of Graco's story. This guy was mad as hell, you can't imagine how. He takes out some bills and throws them to his face... take this, go buy yourself a life. It was beautiful! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Holy shit! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Hello! Sofia! I'm so glad that you're here. - How are you, gorgeous? - Great you made it. Hey, it's my cousin. - How are you sweetheart? - I thought you were not coming! - I know, but... - It's all good. Sofia! I called, but you didn't answer. I wanted to pick you up. Had the two of you met before? Way to go, Coyo! What's up? Why don't you call me anymore? Let's toast to Sofia! Cheers! Hey, they are up there! What are you doing up there by yourselves?! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Suck it. Sofia and Coyo! No, come on! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Where are we going? Why do you want to know? You have something better to do? Look at this. - Cool, where did you get it? - I've got my ways... Hand it over. Sofia asked about you. Really? Yeah, I told her your mommy didn't allow to have a girlfriend. Dude! I'm kidding. Chill out. So what about my cousin, man? Well, she's mine. - Are you serious? - Yes. - When will you see her again? - Dunno, you know how girls are like. - Are you high yet? - Nah. - You? - Nope. Stupid Kennedy... Come here. You want to play? Alright, Kennedy, time to run! - Shh. - What happened? - Someone's in the garden. - Where's Kennedy? - Dad, where's Kennedy? - Sit down, son. Ricardo, Ricardo... Come here, please step away from the window. Who's out there?! What's going on is really important, son. But Kennedy is also important. I know he is, son. We'll both look for him tomorrow, OK? - What if something happens to him? - He is fine Ricky, go to bed. - Mom, please. - Stop it Ricky! Go to bed. We'll look for him tomorrow. - Kennedy! - Kennedy! Holy crap. Let's go. He's here. Where were you? - Looking for Kennedy. - Why do you disobey me? You didn't want to go look for him, but he's our dog. Your dad and the cops have spent 2 hours looking for you! - It's not my fault that... - You dragged Gerardo into this! What's the matter with you?! Who do you think you are?! - It's my dog! - Don't talk to me like that! Tomorrow we'll go look for him. Ricky, I'm talking to you! Come here! Hello? No, you didn't wake me up. What happened? - Did you kill my dog, motherfucker? - I didn't do shit. - Of course you did! - I didn't do shit! Stop it, dude! I didn't do it, man. Did they find out what happened to Kennedy? Not yet. Isn't there anything we can do about it? We've done everything that could be done. That's not true. It isn't? How so? You could've fired your gun. I didn't know what was going on. I wasn't going to shoot just like that. Besides, that's what police are for. The police do nothing. And we can't do much more. How was it? Where did you find it? Down at the park. Did you see the body? It will pass, you'll see. You'll feel better. - You almost hit it, dude! - Fuck! Move your asses. - Make sure your arms don't break apart. - Yeah, don't break down... - Dammit! - It's my turn. - You missed both shots. - Go to hell. Be careful Coyo. Careful, my ass. There it is... You're such a bad shot! The sight is crooked. Not as crooked as your mother! Now dance, faggots! Easy dude, relax. Graco, stop it. Put it down. You want it? You shoot us, you die! Hell no. Don't do it. Now who's a pussy? Enough of this shit, man. Gimme the gun, you moron! Hand the gun over now! Stop fucking around. Now I'm going to teach you a lesson. Gonna break your skull. - Hey, I didn't shoot you. - Dance, idiot. - I didn't shoot you, man. - You too! Dance! Who's laughing now, eh? - Who's laughing now? - Don't be an asshole. - You shit your pants! - Don't you ever do that again, OK? Oh, if you want, I can do it again! Chacho, stop. Enough you douche! - I'll fucking kill you! - Oh, yeah? Just try! OK, guys, enough. What do you fucking want? You want a piece of me? Cool down, you both. I can fuck you up! - You mess with me and you're dead! - Is that right? Bring it on! This is so boring. Yeah, let's go somewhere else. Can you bring the SUV? Yeah, but where do we go? I don't know. Somewhere cool. - Get up, ladies. - You moron... Let's go, Chacho. Your time has come you morons! Fuck yeah! - Did you see his face man?! - Holy shit, dude! - Hit those faggots there. - Don't miss them! Run motherfuckers. Run! Awesome! Who should it get? The girl walking right there! - Here, you faggots! - Right on, dude! Right on! - Run, assholes! - Dude, you got them! This is fucking great! Dude, I did get one! Hit those faggots there. Suck it motherfuckers! That was so cool, Graco! Did you see that? They were so scared! - This is so cool, man! So cool! - Who's next? Come on! Jesus! Look at those boobs! I fucked her once at a party. - You're kidding, did you fuck her? - I swear I did. - I'm sure you were drunk. - I can remember, so I wasn't. You are always drunk. It wasn't easy, she plays hard to get. I'm not joking, she plays really hard to get. - Yeah right, Chacho. - It's true, I scored. - Good evening, sir. - Hi. - How much? - Three hundred pesos please. That's not enough, man. It's OK. Not enough for who? For your mother, dimwit. Is it for you? Pay for it, then. Why me dude? - You never pay for anything. - I agree, the man's got a point. - Of course I have, you idiots. - Exactly, you've never paid a dime. Ok, ok, stop whining, I got you covered. Holy crap. I'll write it down. "Ruco pays gas for the first time." I can't believe it. Hallelujah. Dude, dude! Hey! We ain't gonna pay, OK? - Start the car, start the car! - What the fuck is this?! - What the fuck are you doing?! - Stop it, man! Don't talk to him like this. Don't yell at him. Please, sit down. - It's Gera. - Tell him I'm taking a nap. - What? - Yes, I'm going for a walk. Ah, OK... Are you mad at him or something? No, just tell him I'm taking a nap. I'll call him later. - OK. - Bye. Look, man... You can mark up to three girls, whichever you like. And they can be your girlfriends, or not. But the mark's the mark, and you have to respect that. I marked Sofia first. Hey man, it's not only for you! Dude... Did you bring it? - Of course. - Let us see it, come on! - I want to see it. - Not until we get there. - Come on, dude! - Just show it! Holy shit! - Let me see it. - What did I tell you? - It's awesome! - Out of this world! It's not a toy, asshole, be careful! Yeah, it's not a toy. Fucking kids. - That's it. - Hold on dude. Later, later. Haven't touched a weapon before, ladies? Go fuck yourself. Let's get the hell out of here! Not so fast smart-ass. Where should we go? There's nothing. Somewhere isolated, man. Everything's closed. Maybe a taco stand but there's people. There! That little joint. - OK dude. - But there's someone there. - It doesn't matter. - Park over there. Here, quick! Park here. Come on! That guy is leaving, no sweat. - Right on! - This is it. - Who's turn is it? - Uneven finger game. - OK, good idea. - Come on uneven game! Un-e-ven! Un-e-ven! Again. Un-e-ven! Come on dude, put that finger down. - Why? - You flipped it. - I didn't see anything. - You flipped it. You're cheating! And what if I did, huh? Guys, he's chetaing! Dude, you'll have to go anyway. And why me first? Dude, just go! Don't be a pussy! - Come on. - Give me the gun, asshole. You'll see, I'm not a pussy. - Oops, someone is upset. - Fuck you! Hurry up. Come on, Chacho! He won't do it. A thousand pesos say he won't. The hoodie. He forgot the hoodie. Wow. He's doing it! What the fuck is he doing? What's that in his hand? Run asshole! Run man, run! - Let's go dude, let's go! - Drive away! Pull back! - You hit the trash can man! - Go, go, go! Holy shit dude, I did it! I robbed him! How much money did you get? You should've seen him. He was standing there and I told him... 'Come on, give me your money', and he said 'give me a break'... And I said 'the money!' And then he gave a jar with the money. - There's only fifty pesos here, man! - What a bummer! It was just a fucking street joint! What did you expect? Don't fuck with me! Stop bullshitting us, you pussy. - Go fuck yourself! - Shut the fuck up guys! Give me that, you idiot! - You got scared dude! - You point at me again and I'll shoot you. Come on, stop this thing. Stop it! Calm down! The hell with you, assholes. Dude, come on! I put myself in there. - Yeah dude. - Yeah, that's enough. Chacho! Chacho, it was awesome dude. Let's go for something else. Something better. - OK, let's do it. - Let's go! But some cool place. OK, keep going straight. Right here, right here... - Yeah, right here. - The bakery. Whose turn is it? Another uneven. OK, but you do it. I'm done. - Shut up! - Come on dude. - Give me a fucking break. - Come on. - Don't cheat this time. - Fuck you. Un-e-ven! Your turn Coyo. Now? Yeah, make it quick. Bring some real money, not fucking coins. I'll drive dude. We are gonna have to flee out of here. OK. - Just be careful with the car. - Or course, don't worry. Wanna bet he won't do it? How much? - What happened, Coyo? - I couldn't do it. Dude, come on. You were scared, that's different. People were there, dude. - It's fine. - What do you mean, it's fine? It would have been a disaster. Let's go somewhere else. No. Let's wait until they leave the store. Come back with money this time, asshole. I will. - Well, your call. - OK. - Good evening. - Good evening. Thank you. Nine pesos. Don't you have a smaller bill? No, just this one. I don't have change. You need to have some change. No, I've already told you I don't have any change. Please! But it's just five hundred change. - I told you I don't have any change. - Yeah, but I really need to break this bill. - I already said no. - It's just change! You go change that somewhere else. Look, I don't know how to explain this, but I really need the change. You want the bread or not? - Why won't you change this bill? - I already told you I can't! Please ma'am, check in your drawer. I'm sure you have some money there. I don't have any! Come on ma'am, don't be an ass. Hey asshole, don't talk to her like that! Who the fuck is talking to you? Just leave, go somewhere else! Is this how you treat your customers? Or even worse. Go fuck yourself! - What did you call me? - What you heard asshole! Shut the fuck up! You stay there motherfucker! You, give me the money! And you, stay there! - Money, right now! - Easy, easy... Shut the fuck up! Stay there! - Shut up! Stay there. - That is not a fucking toy. Open it! Open that damn thing! I thought you said you had no change. Take everything, take it all. Wait up! Dude! Taxi. - Dude, what happened? - What happened with you? Where's the SUV? We left it there. You're not going anywhere. What do you mean you left it? Why? Listen, go to your house and say that you got mugged. - No, dude. - Trust me, asshole. Go to your house and tell them you got mugged, OK? No dude. It's my father's SUV! Just leave, dude! Fuck! What happened? I was on a red light when someone approached me... and when I realized, he was pointing a gun at me. He told me to get out or else he would kill me. Did he point his gun at you? And then what happened? He told me to turn around and don't look back. How many were them? Maybe more than one, but I only saw one. How did he look like? Could you identify him? Did you see his face or did you not? Yes. Then you'd be able to identify him, right? Yes. Can you sign here, please? I'm so glad you're OK. Were you scared? Yeah, a little. Me too. Wake me up if you need anything. Sure. - You promise? - Yes, mom, I promise. I'm fine. I love you so much, my son. Me too. Get some rest. I've already told you everything. What else do you need to know? The same person that stole the SUV, killed a man in a bakery store. Who told you that? Wait. I'll explain how this goes. The suspect will come out. You'll lean out and hide behind the officer. You take a good look at him, and that's it. Don't worry. Bring him out, please! Come. It's alright. Don't worry. So? - Yes. - Yes, what? - It was him. - He pointed his gun at you? - Yes. - Are you sure? Mom. - Where's Dad? - In the restroom. - Dad? Can you come here? - Yes. I have to tell you something. I have to tell you both. Ricardo, come here! What is it? No one stole the SUV. I went for a ride with my friends, and the gun went off and I hit someone. Come in, come in. It's a big house. And how come it's empty? It was rented, but the tenants left, and I decided not to rent anymore. - Such a beautiful day. - It's perfect. - Good morning Rick. - Good morning. - How are you? - Fine, you? Fine, thanks. Is your mom in? - She's still sleeping. - Is that so? - I had a dog too. - You did? Where is it? - He died. - Oh, I'm sorry. Come on! Go ahead Otto. How's your dad? Have you talked to him? No. Don't you know when he's coming in? Oh, we love it. We're so happy, aren't we? - I love this town. It's amazing. - That's good. - The weather is really nice. - The weather, the sky, I just love it. Now we want to... ...enroll Ricky at the local school. That's a good thing. Can you advise on this Jane? What do I need to do? What is the paperwork involved? Where should I go? Do you know what would be your grade here? I think here I would be in 10th. - Yes, because in Mexico... - Is that high school? There's a high school near the house. It must be about three blocks away. Ricky! - Your dad called. - What's up? - We're going back. - Where to? Mexico. He's not coming here? No. Ricky, we can't stay here. But we already have everything figured out. Everything got sorted out, we must take this opportunity so we're going back tomorrow. But can't you try to convince dad? I don't want to convince him, it took him an... enormous effort to sort things out, Ricky. Can't you understand that? - I don't want to go back. - Well, I don't want to live here! We have nothing here. The house isn't ours, we have no friends nor family. Nothing. Our life is elsewhere. I need your support for this, can you do that, or not? - Yes. - Alright. Please, start packing your stuff. - What do you guys think? - It's OK. - It's nice. - You like it? Very much. How about our rooms? - Upstairs. Wanna go? - Yes. I'll be there in a minute. Hi, Luisa. What are you doing here? I came to see Gerardo. He's not home. When is he coming back? Did you call him on the phone? No. Well, don't look for him. When can I see him? I forbid you from looking for him. You can't see him here or elsewhere. You can't even call him on the phone. Understood? Yes. - People are saying things about you. - Like what? You know what. Coyo, are you okay? Why don't you answer me? Are you through with dinner? Would you like something else? No, thanks. Let's go. Come on. Here. Yes. Look.
