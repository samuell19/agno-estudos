(Horse hooves clomping) (Laughter) (Instrumental music) Okay Sonny. Yes'm. Do you know a man by the name of Billy Reynolds? Mr. Billy Reynolds? Yeah. Oh sure. The grocery. I saw him go in there about 5 minutes ago. Thanks honey. Potatoes 40 cents a bushel. Won't be long though. You'll hold steer the way those cow hands of mine eat. A lot of new folks settling here. It runs the prices up on things. I'll get your coal out from the drum outside. Good Mike. Ten gallons. Billy. Abby Nixon. - It's been a long time. - Not long enough to suit me. I got to do you a good turn no matter how I hate it. Where are your guns? Guns? Oh, well I don't wear them anymore. I'm not the Marshall now. I can still see the Tin Star. Anyway, get out of town quick. Why? Cole and Bud Gorman are here. Oh...you certain? (Instrumental music) I'm not going to spell it for you or try to hammer into that thick head of yours, gets going. We're still riding with the guns. Why you telling me this? that I owe you one favor. For what? The hold up in Carson. You could have shot me but you let me get away. Oh. That time? I might just ran out of cartridges. Don't act noble. Now, once is enough from you. It's like eating crow everyday being beholden to you. (Instrumental music) Well, now we're all square. You better make a run for it or else get yourself killed. It's all the same to me. I know that. Maybe you'd better walk out ahead of me. Oh, so I'm not on the level huh? I'm settin' you up for blood and coal, is that what you think? I wouldn't put it past you. Why you stupid knot-head. They'll be coming down the street any minute. I shoulda let them shoot you down without a chance. Look, I'll walk out in front of you. They won't dare take the risk of hitting me. Go. Well that would be a pity and a waste. Pretty girl like you. Don't try to talk human. Well I've done all I could for you. You stay right here and take what's coming. Abby Nixon, ain't it? Jesse Gorman's girl. You talk too much, Mike. (Instrumental music) Happy. Ooh, hello Billy. He he. You drinking in the morning now? You got some guns I can use? Sure, got some I took away from Luke Masters a couple of months ago. Nice pair of guns. But Luke almost shot his foot off in the condition he was in. You goin' hunting? Bud and Cole Gorman are in town. Now you're not going to do nothing like that, are ya Billy? Like what? They've been shooting their mouth off about how they were gonna get me ever Ever since I sent their brother Jesse to prison. I heard Judge Roberts say the other night that there's gonna be a real jury trial on the next gun killing. Somebody better tell Cole and Bud Gorman about that. Time's are changing. These new church people want things civilized. Sure, the time they get the Gorman's civilized, I'd be dead. Billy, let the sheriff pick 'em up. I pick up my own trouble. (Suspenseful music) (Buzzing sounds) - How's that, Mr. Reynolds? - Fine H. (Suspenseful music) (Gunshot) (Dramatic music) (Suspenseful music) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Suspenseful music) Cole, drop your gun. Drop it! (Gunshots) (Dramatic music) (Footsteps) (Instrumental music) (Instrumental music) (Footsteps shuffling) Hope they ain't gonna hang you for this, Billy. (Dog panting) rs on that jury. They don't care what the custom was before. They just want the gunfightin' to stop now. So they turned the page of the calendar over on me. Well, it's, it's progress I guess you'd call it. Was it just and fair, Ed? I don't know. You had official legal warning. And besides, we're all going to work to get you parole. - No. - What? - Well I don't want it. Wow now Billy. I didn't get a fair shake. I don't figure what I did was wrong, and I'm not taking this. What they say by a clock and a calendar. That don't make it right. Alright, off! Wind up right there. Hiya Billy. Oh you remember me. Joe Holbert, Dodge City. I used to tend bar there. Yeah, how are ya? Fine. Sorry to hear about all this. Some of us don't think you got a square deal. Kind of sad to see the country grow up ain't it? People like you and me just ain't gonna know how to live any place where killing's illegal. No talking to the prisoners. How come? Never mind how come. It's just one of the regulations. All right, everybody in the wagon. See ya soon, Billy. Yeah. He don't look as discouraged as I would, if I was going up for 10 years. He ain't got a look at that prison yet, maybe he's forgotten Jess Gorman's still in there. (Chains rattling) (Instrumental music) What kind of place is this prison? Shut up and get in that wagon. (Train horn) Let's go. (Instrumental music) (Dramatic music) The new prisoners are coming in, warden. Yeah, I saw the wagon. Everything quiet? Yeah. Everybody's too hot to make a move. I'll be it's 130 degrees in those cells. Well anyway, it keeps them a little quiet. Not their minds. You know the feeling of hate's so strong around this place, you could cut it in slices. Yeah. This always takes care of everything. So far. Here they are. (Dramatic music) Want to talk to him? No, you handle him. Give it to the warden, will you? Drop your chains. All right, listen closely you men. We had a little trouble here last month. Little boys decided they'd like to get out for a spell, and they went to a lot of trouble to see what they could do about it. Well, they got out all right. They're still outside. In the cemetery. Now if you'd like to know about this prison, it's solid rock. You got the river and quicksand on two sides of ya, and walls 8 feet thick on the other two. You've got a sun here that boils up to around 130 in the shade. If that's not enough to cool off your boisterous spirits, we've got solitary cells. Plenty of guards. Plenty of guns. (Hammering) Long time since I've seen you, Billy. You don't remember, do you? When you were marshall, you brought an old cattle rustler up here. Cussed me, so I wrapped him one. You thought I acted a little too tough. So I got a poor memory for faces. I never forget a punch. It was a left on the jaw. Punched a lot of people. and I've been punched Hope you recovered? Oh I'm doing fine, Billy. Doing fine. Better than you'll be doing. You three, inside. You'll find everything real clean and cozy. Ah, welcome Señores. Come in, sit down, please. You will never regret choosing this cell, amigos. The company is delightful, the food's incredible. I hope you don't turn out to be one of them talking Mexicans. Only when there is something interesting to say. And who has ever seen the day when this is not true? I've seen so many of them days I couldn't count them on one calendar. I am Jorge Jose Pedro Enrique De La Torres Garcia Gomez We'll try to figure that out later. This is Virgil Gates. - Oh. - Yes. This is Billy Reynolds. Billy Reynolds? I am honored, Señor. Why? You give character to this whole cell, and besides, We can have many delightful evenings discussing your fabulous exploits. This is going to seem like one of the longest 50 years sentences on record. Which is our bunk? Uh take your pick. Whatcha in here for, Gomez? Just a little matter of property dispute. What kind of property? The cattle. I bought a few from this man. He claimed I forget to pay him back. No, why a cattle rustler? Ah no, I think of myself more as a speculator in livestock. (Laughter) Huh. Maybe the judge didn't see it in the same light as you did. Mmm. At least you're in here for doing something. Me, I didn't do nothing. Truly, nothing at all. What'd the judge say you done? Nothing. I just stood there and watched the warehouse burn. I like to look at fires. Your warehouse? Mmm hmm. Insured? Yeah, but I forgot I owned it. The judge said I should've called the fire department, but I said but judge, you got to give a fella time to remember things. Well, he did. He gave me three years. (Laughter) An ill-timed remark, my friend, eh? (Laughter) How big is this cell? Seven feet North. Eight feet West. Hah. I have paced it a thousand times. And when the walls, they start closing in on you, it seems more like about two by two. When they start closing in on me, I'm going to bust right through. It's not too bad. You get used to it. Not me. I'll never get used to it. Come on, Reynolds. You're getting a special treat today. Don't ever just sit there and look at me when I tell you to move. That's the way we run things Reynolds. My jumping when we're told to jump. Smiling when we're told to smile, and even giving up our teeth when one of the guard's seems to want 'em bad enough. Take him to the warden. This life of a celebrity. Heh. It must be very difficult at times, no? Not be lost in the crowd. It's the only way to get along when in prison. If they can remember your name they'll always think to call it out if it's in the dirty work or in the punishment to be give out. You know I've lived through 8 prisons. In about the same amount of wives but just blending into the background when the noise gets loud. (Laughter) You can wait outside. Hello Reynolds. How are ya? I'm sorry to see you here like this. Now these are letters from prominent friends of yours. That assure me that you're innocent and shouldn't be here. Is that the way you feel about it? Yes. And why did you refuse to sign application for a parole or a pardon? Because I wouldn't get it. They're trying to make an example out of me. Somebody has to be made an example, Reynolds. You really believe that? Yes, I do. Maybe you haven't got this straight in your mind. The New Order said, no more gunfighting. You ignored the order. You killed two men didn't you? It was a stupid order. That wasn't for you to decide was it? We have 500 men in this prison. Each one of them decided some law was stupid. Or unjust. Or inconvenient to them personally. You've been the keeper of the peace. What started your thinking in this twisted way? Maybe I've seen the inside of your prison. Well I'm not proud of it. The criticizing prison conditions isn't an answer to the question. Look Reynolds, There are just two ways for a man like you to go. You can accept your punishment and come back on the right side of the law where you belong, or you can turn renegade to every decent thing you ever believed in. Whatever the warden says. I'll only bore you for a moment longer. It's a rough deal on the other side of the fence. When you get to know your new friends better I hope you'll see that. I don't plan on being around that long. That's an even rougher deal. Well I'll take it I doubt it. You're not stupid, Reynolds. And the fact that you felt obligated to warn me of a breakout gives me a lot of hope. And I'll be just as honest with you. I intend to work on you. Turn your back to a keeper of the peace. But if I fail in that and you start anything, you'll be treated just the same as any other prisoner. I didn't expect it any other way. g us and the raw gang two nights only five men down today from sunstroke. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What does the warden do with their fried brains when they croak? Feed 'em to you guards? (Laughter) It ain't funny. Did Reynolds check in yet? Yeah, we got a good look at him. Eh, he ain't so much. No, without his guns... You'd like to take him on, huh? He's quite a man. You're going after him, ain't ya? Did I say I wasn't? No, but praising the man who killed you bro... (Dramatic music) Reg's tongue slipped, he didn't... - I forgot Jesse. - Don't forget! How ya plannin' to get him, Jesse? In the warden's office, with all the doors and windows locked. That'll pin it on the warden. Huh? You're asking me for a plan. I haven't got one. Reynolds needs the plan. How to keep me from getting them, it's his life. If I am to study him is if I find out how he thinks he's going to stay alive. He's thinking about me awful good. Huh. All right. Get your harmonica and play it, yeah. Sure, Jesse. What would you like? Oh, something funny. something real funny Guard detail coming in. (Instrumental 'Camptown Races' music) (Door slams) Pretty hot, eh? You know there is a man here who wants to kill you? I know there's a man here who wants to try. How'd you know? I'm a likable person. People, they tell me things. Thanks Gomez. What is that music? It is saloon not too far from the prison. When the wind she is right, you hear all the festivities. Listen. That is the same girl who was there last night. Haha. She is drinking too much. (Woman laughing) (Carnival music) (Door slams) Polk, get back there! (Machine gun firing) (Yelling) Get down from there! Don't try it! You can't stop me, nobody can stop me. I can't take any more of this! I'm gettin' outa here! (Door slams) Oooh Aaah! (Thud) Hey Wells, I got a dead one by the wall. (Indistinct shouting) His pal's too scared to move. Good work, Davis. We'll take care of him. Some cons are awful stupid. Blowing their tops and rushing the wall. The sound of the gun gives their screws a swelled head. Sometime I'm going to show them how it's done. Real smart. Anytime soon, Jesse? But not tonight. (Laughter) Virgil. How long you say you in here for? Three years. Three years. If I was only in here for three years, I wouldn't even take my shoes off. Hey you, I'll tell you when to rest. Gorman. He's still staring at you. Something on your mind, Gorman? Reynolds don't scare that easy. He's got a real bad temper too. But your brothers found that out, didn't they? Here, what do they mean, here? You argue that with the judge, warden. All I know is what he wrote on the paper. Armed robbery. Well, bring the prisoner in. In here. Miss Nixon, you have been sentenced to 2 years in Arizona Territorial Prison. That's right. Well. You're not exactly what I expected, No. I guess you were expecting something more in the order of a man. Well, it's a man's prison. Well I was perfectly willing to leave it that way but This judge was sort of insistent. The judge had absolutely no right to send you here, Miss Nixon. I kinda seem to feel that he did. He said there was no other place to send. Well, what I meant is we don't have facilities here for taking care of a woman. There are 500 men. That should prove interesting. These are desperate, dangerous men. I'll try not to make them anymore desperate. And as for being dangerous, I didn't know they made any other kind. (Laughter) Now this is only temporary, and I'll try to keep you separated from the men as much as possible. What in the world is a girl like you doing mixed up in an armed robbery? Holding up banks, Stagecoaches, Well, it seemed like a profitable line of work, warden. And it keeps you in the open a good deal. Don't you have any family? None that I want to have notified if that's what you mean? (Sighs) Get her processed. Ah, put in an extra room in the hospital away from the other prisoners. You want her hair clipped, warden? No. No, but arrange to put her in some sort of uniform. I, I'll speak to the prison doctor. Maybe you can give him a hand? Um, it'll help kill the time while you're here. Thanks. And don't worry about the other prisoners, warden. I've taken care of myself with men. Even when they had guns. This way. (Muffled chatter) (Jeering) Go on, make room. Go on. Step back. - Is it a mirage? - It must be. Nope, she's real. If I had a razor, I'd shave. Well, you visiting here, Abby? For two years. I'm sorry. Sorry about Cole and Bud Gorman too? No. Only that you got caught. Huh. Where's Jesse? I don't know. Road gang I guess. Get moving Reynolds. - You seem well acquainted here. - Yeah. I used to get around quite a bit. Well... It's like home. Only cleaner. Thanks Things may not be too bad in here for you Abby, if you behave yourself. Well I'll sure try and behave Captain Now you're a very pretty girl, Abby. Thanks. You don't belong in a place like this at all. I'm ready to leave anytime you say. I might even be able to arrange that once in awhile. Maybe a trip into town now and then when the warden's away. Now why would you want to do a thing like that for me? Oh like I said, you're a very pretty girl. - You... - You mean you once had a sister that looked like me? No, I don't mean that. A mother? Now look sister, don't play games with me. I can make it easy for you or I can make it plenty tough. Plenty tough. And you get one thing straight, stupid. You ever threaten me again and I'll really put you in a bind. You? Ha ha. What could you do? - Do you want me to give you an idea? - Yes. Go ahead. Well, I guess this might be a good time at that. - Aaaah! Aaaah! - What's the matter with you? - What are you doing? Cut it out. - Aaaaaah! - Aaaah! - Shut up, will ya? Shut up! But I didn't do anything. And if I ever catch you doing it again, I'll throw you out of this job and out of this prison so fast. - Warden, you don't understand. I understand perfectly. Now you get it through your head, That girl wasn't brought here for your entertainment. You get back to your job and don't let me ever catch you near that girl again. - But warden, I... - Get out of here! Get out! (Indistinct chatter) I watch behind you Billy. Hope you got tea in your stomach, Virgil. Ooh, what is it? Well I'd say that's some leftover dishwater from last night with a few chunks of chalk in it. That floating by you right there, might be a sheep's eye. No, it it must be a slightly mildewed pickled lamb's kidney. What would you say Gomez? It could be a goulash of underdone eel. with ah, some dried driftwood. (Laughter) Ah, you better look out for splinters Virgil. How can you eat it? But my friend, think of the adventure. The suspense. You know this does have a touch of fishiness in it. You know it's pretty good stew as stew goes around here. Of course I wish old Cookie'd stay out of it with his feet when he's mixing it up. What's the matter, Reynolds? Don't you like the food? Well speak up. I'm willing to listen to complaints. We're sort of proud of our food here. Hey Wells, I got a complaint. This grub stinks like you. (Laughter) (Suspenseful music) (Shouting) (Grunting) (Dramatic music) (Crashing) (Jeering) All right. No more food. Get 'em all back to work. Break your arm? Nah. Probably just dislocated it. All right. Take these two over to the hospital. Then put 'em on the pumps and keep them there the rest of the day. All right. Come on. All right. Everybody out. - Back to work. - Aww. All of ya. Jesse. Oh. Here, here, here. None of that. - You can't stop me. - Listen Abby, they put you in here. There ain't nothing they wouldn't do. You're hurt. Captain thinks this one has a dislocated shoulder. He has a cut on. Sit down here. It's just a bad sprain. You'll be all right. On your feet Gorman. Aren't you going to let him rest a while? Don't ask no favor of him. Well you better see she's treated right doc. Come on. Sit down here, Reynolds. Get me some hot water Abbey. It's a pretty bad cut. How'd it happen Reynolds? It was a fight in the mess hall. Where was your knife son? I didn't have one. Try to make out Jesse took unfair advantage. Put on plenty of medicine doc. He'd like to get blood poison. - Get Jesse in trouble. - There's not much chance of that. You don't know him. He's mean enough to die of blood poisoning if it'd hang Jesse. I know him better than that Abby. (Chuckles) The way you women pick men to love and to hate just never made no sense to me. Hello Eddie. When they give you animals a breather? Yeah, we like to give our mules a rest once in awhile. We're always glad to find men with the get-up-and-go you two showed back there in that fight. (Instrumental music) All right. All right. Let's go. Lay on it! I won't miss ya next time! You better not! You're going to try. I suppose you thought I'd just let you get away with killing Bud and Cole. I never thought about you one way or the other. Sending me up here, then waylaying em in an alley That's how you got him wasn't it? I said how did you get em! They just kind of kept coming. It wasn't very hard. It wasn't much fun. You never could have got 'em fair. Kind of like you. They were so crazy hopped-up mad they couldn't shoot straight. I warned them not to take chances. Well they did. Somebody must have warned you. Who warned ya? WHO WARNED YA! That's another account I'm going to settle. Ya hear me! Why don't you fellas tell 'em to quit fighting. Shouldn't we ask to have Dr. Betts take a look at em? Sun's got him. He's plumb tuckered out. Here Billy. What's that? Whiskey. Mean that's good whiskey? Hehe. They serve it for several years. Hey, stop it. Don't you know better than to get whiskey to an unconscious man? He's not unconscious. ohhhh (groans) - Oh (Laughter) - You have an infection. Aw, there's something wrong with my vitals. Desert fever. They call it my alcoholitis. (Laughter) Yeah. Puh. Aaah! Yeah you take it Gomez. I'll just kill them all sort of gradual like. (Laughter) Now, I'm surprised you kept at it Abby. There ain't much money in robbing stagecoaches anymore since the railroads came in. How do you know? Hmm. Me and a second cousin of mine used to be real active around the Las Cruces area. Why'd you quit? Ah the guards and the passengers started getting so touchy. I even got shot at a couple of times. (Laughter) It's discouraging when people act like that. Yeah. Say, how'd you like to do me a little favor? What? Fix it up so I can talk to a friend of mine. - Who? - Jesse Gorman. Ah, what do you want to talk to him for? He's the meanest guy I ever seen. (Instrumental music) He's 20 bucks. There's another 20 in it for you as soon as you fix it. Uh uh. It's too risky. You don't get wealthy if you don't take chances. Oh I couldn't do that. Where do you want to see? My room at the hospital. Bring them later tonight. Through with your food? (Sighs) Yeah, but I bet it ain't through with me. Baked snake. Aah. You only get that on Sunday. (Instrumental music) Abby. (Romantic music) Whats wrong? Nothin Jesse. Nothin that can't be fixed. Come here, we don't have much time. Wouldn't want to waste any of it. Stop it! (Sighs) Don't tell me you've changed your mind about me? You know I haven't. I just don't like the surroundings. Do you? You trying to drive me crazy acting like this? I want to get us out of here. Oh sure. Just go in nice and polite and ask the warden. This afternoon you acted like your own self. Now you're trying to change the subject. No Jesse. Listen. We can break out of here. Pete and Tommy and Marty are in Yuma. - Yeah? - Yeah. They got it all worked out. How'd you like to spend Christmas in Mexico? Fine. But I ain't interested right now. (Instrumental music) Ugh! When you act like that, you're not making love to me. I'm just anyone. First gal you'd meet on the outside. (Knocking) I gotta take him back now. Not just yet. In a minute. Are you going to listen to me for 2 seconds or do I have to turn you over to the guard. Abby I swear I wouldn't take this from any other girl. Then be patient and listen. All right. I'll listen for 2 seconds. Let's understand each other. I'm breaking out of here and I need your help. Sure honey. All right, then. No more fights with Billy Reynolds. I don't want you in solitary a crippled man. Don't join any break till after I've settled with Reynolds. That's stupid. Let him rot in here. You calling me stupid? Don't act high and mighty with me. I want your word, no more fight with Reynolds. I give the orders. I run this break. I set the time for it. (Instrumental music) You're the man I said goodbye to, crying like a fool. Sure I am happy, Abby. You come in here like a drunken cowhand after a barroom (Indistinct). I'm sorry. I've always been crazy in love with you. I still am. A man in love doesn't keep me in this hellhole just cause he has a killing idea in his head. All right. I'll take care of Reynolds later. - After the break? - After the break. (Instrumental music) What are you doing here? I've got a spider or something in my shoe. Your post is in front of the doc's office, not here. Well, doc sent me with some medicine for Miss Abby. She's (Indistinct). Get back to your post! Yes, sir. (Instrumental music) Quick, Wells just went by the door. - Hurry Jesse. - See ya. Be careful. Oh well, you should be kept in the hospital with this arm, but he thinks I'm coddling you. Best I could do is get you light duty for a couple of days. What's light duty? He can lie down. - If he faints. - Uh. Anybody else for me today? Oh there's a prisoner in cell E6. I couldn't get kick him awake this morning. But you can bet they sure tried. Oh Doc I'd like to talk to him for a minute. Is it all right? Sure. I'll tell the guards you haven't finished the bandage. Thanks. (Door opens) (Door closes) There's something I'd like to know. What? Do you still feel wait of that tin star on your shirt? No. Well, you're smarter than I thought. I can learn. They beat it into my skull. Don't tell me you side with outlaw and disorder? I don't go along with the warden, if that's what you're trying to find out? (Door opens) All right, Reynolds. Let's go. I'm not through with him yet. Well, hurry it up. (Door closes) Theres a break out being planned Why you telling me? Victims sore-headed against you is a pleasure I can't afford right now. And you might be a pretty handy man to have in a break. Does Jesse know about us? Only the break part. Not that I'm inviting you. It's no good. Yes it is. Jesse said he's stop fighting you. I've got a poor opinion of Gorman promises. - Take my word for it? - No. I never lied to you. Tie this. I don't say you'd lie to me Abby. It's just that you keep on with Gorman. That you can't see what he is. Get out. She starts screaming and crying like a bellering calf. My wife says she couldn't live no place unless her ma was right there with her. How old is your wife? Well at the time I'm speaking of, she's about 47. And she couldn't live without her mother? Well she was sort of a young 47. Anyways, I put up with it for years. Seeing the old lady get the best cut of meat and not kicking when she watered my whiskey to cover up how much she'd stole. But one night a bunch of us was playing poker at the house and this old bat was winning over two hundred dollars. She played cards? Look, she not only played them son, she made them. That woman was so handy with a deck of cards I'd a swore she had eight fingers on each hand till one night I grabbed them and checked them for myself. Ah, then what happened? Well I just lost a maze half pulled to here four-of-a-kind. And she must have moved wrong. I heard something elastic snapped inside her dress. Cards started pouring out of here like a water spot. Aces dropping from her bonnet and straight flushes shootin' from her bodice. It was like one of them wind up spring toys that breaks and parts shoots all over the room. There must have been 15 decks of cards shot our of her before she's finished. - What did you do? - Do? I grabbed my gun and I emptied it at her. You killed her? No, she a sneakier than a greased pig. She start dodging around that room like she'd been doing it for a living all her life. You, you didn't hit her? Didn't even nick her. But I did shoot and kill one of the best friends I ever had that was there at the party. I got 50 years. She ain't got a mark on her. Where is she now? Running the card game in the living room of my house. My wife and kids ain't never had so well in all their life. (Knocking) (Instrumental music) This is the last time I bring him. It's too risky. Don't you like money? I don't like Gorman. Hurry it up. I heard from Pete today Well what did he say? When is it going to be? It ain't what Pete says It's what I say. All right, but when? Is it tomorrow? We've gotta get out of this place. It's giving me the willies. Oh ease off. It can't happen that fast. Yes it can. Look. The map of the whole layout. Now the first move is to grab that gatling gun. (Crinkling) What's the matter? I do the thinking. This is a surprise. You're talking like this. Well...you've been through a bad time Jesse. I should understand that. Yeah. (Snickers) (Ominous music) Yeah, both of us have. It was some evening, I'm afraid. (Laughter) It'll be funny. Ha, ha. Real funny. - How evil. - Jesse! - Don't talk like that. (Smirks) Huh? Aw, don't pay any attention to me, honey. I got a bad habit of thinking out loud to myself sometimes. I'm gonna be awful good to you Abby. Awful good, once we're in Mexico. Sure Jesse. I know you will. Here's the plan. They'll be a shipment of medicine. Pete's gonna hide guns in the packing case. Just be sure you get to it before anybody else. Yeah. (Knocking) (Instrumental music) Time's up Miss Abby. All right. Can I pay you for another time? No. What I said about him was a kind of a hint for your sake. Now, you'll keep. (Instrumental music) (Hammering) You ask Stinky? It's the stuff that's planted in Reynold's cell. Wells might like to know. - Ah. -You got a nose like a bird dog, Ward. Stinky tells me Billy Reynolds is (Indistinct). Reynolds? - Why I thought Jesse Gorman. - So did I. Well Stinky tells me Reynolds has got a knife, a saw and other stuff in his cell. Reynolds? I should have guessed it. And he has to breakout, or kill Gorman or get killed. He warned me of a breakout. I'll strip him down and stick him in solitary. Now wait. Hold on. Let's try to be a little smarter than that. Oh I get it. You wait for Stinky and the other stoolies to tell us whose in it with em. Right. I'll work all angles. We got to stop this before it gets started. If Reynolds weren't so bitter and in such a tough spot. How do you stand with him doc? Friendly I'd say. Maybe you'd better have a talk with him. I could do that. But he'd be much more apt to listen to the girl. Abby? (Snickers) Has the heat go you? - She's Gorman's girl. - Just a hunch of mine. Based on what? Well, the clinical observation you might stay. I didn't ask you to explain your hunch. Now, now wait, doc. Wait, now. It's worth a try. You send her over to the house this evening. Will ya? - All right. - Hmm. Doc said you wanted to talk to her. (Sighs) Yeah. Wait outside. Sit down there. Like some coffee? No thanks. I've had it. I suppose you wonder why I sent for you. Well Abby, there's going to be a break. Is that news to you? - Yes - Now I thought it would be. Since you're the only woman behind the walls the only decent thing for me to do is to warn you about what might happen. That's very thoughtful of you. No doubt you've read about attempted prison breaks. And a few that were more than just attempted. Oh yes, now and then several of them get beyond the wall. But mostly they don't get that far. You know I remember one time oh... it must have been 10 years ago. I was superintendent of guards at Huntsville. Ah that's a Texas state prison. Five prisoners were trying to get away. They'd made some knives and they had a couple of guns. Then what? Then they captured three guards and the family of one of the guards who was visiting the prison. A wife and two little girls. (Instrumental music) Well, when they were cornered with their hostages, they ran out of ideas. They saw they weren't going to make it. The more desperate they got, the more brutal they became. You sure you wouldn't like some coffee? Well, they killed the guards. Their way of doing it wasn't very pretty. When the warden still refused their demands, they turned on the woman and the two little girls. By this time, they weren't even human beings. (Sinister music) Warden I'd, I'd like to leave. Don't you want to hear about the woman and the little girls? I could tell you a story about what happens in your own prison. Yes, the guards are brutal. Some of them. But remember this, the prisoners started the rough stuff long before they got caught and were put in here. The law says I have to stay here and listen. The law is talking to you right now Abby. The law says that when men start a war against society, the peacemakers have got to fight. It's a cruel and bloody business but we have no choice. And we always win. Sure, sure. Now, if you want take this morning for yourself, Isn't there someone in there that you care about? I don't know anything about a break I don't know anyone who's planning a break. But if you did, would you help me talk him out to keep him from being killed? No. You kill a man anyway. Everyday you take a week, month, year away from him. He'd be better off dying all at once. May I go back to the hospital now? Guard! (Instrumental music) That's all. Thanks for the history lesson. - Sit up. Now come on, come on. Outside. Get 'em outside. Take 'em out. Come on Reynolds. Come on, come on. - Get down. - Out, out, go! - What are you looking for? - I think you know. (Rummaging) Hey Captain Here it is warden Well. You want to name the others or do you prefer a stretch in solitary? That stuff was planted there. - Maybe by Wells. - (Smirks) Say something smarter than that. Put him in the hole. What about the others? He's the one you want. You'll like solitary, Billy. I'll make it nice and comfortable for you. Aah! - Why you... - Wells! Take him away. Alright the rest of you... Inside! all of ya! Now i'll know where to find em. (Instrumental music) Don't let him open anything unless the guard's there. How about this medical stuff? Tell the doc to check every box himself. Guard. Hope up there. Help unload this. It's gonna be pretty hot for those guys in that cell block. Espcially when that sun goes to work. I can't help it They're going to stay locked up until someone decides to talk. (Instrumental music) (Sigh) Doc's supposed to check this stuff. Where is he? Well he's not here yet. I guess you better Put it all in the store room there. Let's take it in. (Muffled conversation) (Shouting) (Yelling) You figure the guns got here? Lie down. It'll be a long sweat until tonight. (Suspenseful music) (Knocking) Abby. Yeah doc. Uh, we were out of the carbonic solution and I thought I'd come here and get one. Warden says to inspect all this stuff. He's nervous about a break. He put Billy Reynolds in solitary Too bad he had to do that. (Suspenseful music) Hey doc, got a new patient. the sun's got him bad. I'll be right with ya. Straighten up this mess Abby. I may be needing you in a minute. (Dramatic music) (Banging) - Find out what's keeping Abby. I need her. - Yes, sir. (knocking) (Knocking) Hey Abby. Yes. Did you have to make this mess just to get one bottle? Doc did it hunting for guns. Push along. Doc needs you. Guard. Where's the guard over this post? Coming up. Coming up. Doc I, I want to talk to Billy Reynolds. Talk? Bet you just want to get him out of that baking oven for a spell. No, I want to talk about something very important. I'll ask the warden. Well, let's see if we can keep this man alive. (Shouting) Warden says Dr. Betts wants to see him. It's all set. For tonight I thought I told you to leave me out of it. Go with us. They'll never let up on ya in here. I don't want them to break you or, or kill you. I thought I disliked you so much it wouldn't matter But it does Now tell me the real reason. All right. You're a good man with a gun and you can keep your head. I wanted to give you the last chance but I'm not going to beg you. But there isn't a chance Abby That's how much you know. We'll walk out of here like it was a cracker box. You'll never make it. And if you do make it, what lies ahead of you then? Mexico. - Life, freedom - With Jesse? Yes, with Jesse. I know how you feel about him. He's not himself in here. They've changed him. He'll be all right once we're free. Free? You're not ever going to be free with that gun crazy maniac. All right. I've said my say. I'll call the guard. Wait. There's something I want to say. What's going to happen to you? All of a sudden it makes a great deal of difference to me. What? You, Marshall Reynolds? Why you'd laugh if anything happened to me. No. No I wouldn't laugh. (Romantic music) Don't You want me to break out of here? All right. But not with him leading the way. And don't follow me either. I'd like for you to have something you've never had before. A good life. A decent one. Guard! Guard! You needn't have done that Good luck Abby. Finished with him? (Door closes) (Muffled chatter) Remember you're sick. You're real sick. Lie down. Hey Scrooge, there are two men down in here. You gonna let 'em die? Shut up Gorman. go get Morgan. - Go get him I tell ya. - I said shut up. (Yelling) (Commotion) Open E7. (Indistinct shouting) Shaw and Red can't take anymore. Their hearts are gone bad. Now listen, all of you. You are going to stay in these cells until you decide to cooperate. I know there's a break planned. And a lot of you know it too. (In unison) Yeah! (Screaming) All right, all right. That's the way you want it? You'll stay locked up with nothing to eat until somebody talks. Who are you trying to fool, Morgan. You know it's Reynolds. Why don't you work on his pals. Put a stove in that cell, why don't ya. The ransom is down to post number three, warden. The doc says he's pretty bad. Oh sorry. Camp hospital. You hear that boys? a screw drops from the heat and Morgan's sorry. (Laughter) (Door closes) It wadn't Morgan that framed Billy. Joe and Red acting sick to tip-off I figure. Do you think Gorman's gonna break? If he has, whose side are we on? I'd sure like to get out of here. Get Billy out of solitary. On the other hand, I despise joining up with Gorman All right. Quit puzzling me. l music) You can finish that in the morning Abby. I'm dead beat. I'm going to call it a day. They're outa water in the ward. As soon as the guard comes with the water cart, I'll turn in myself. Right. Goodnight Abby. Goodnight Doc. Not a sound. Back in the door. Get inside! Move! What about the other guard? He ain't gonna bother us. You want to live you'll do just like I tell ya. Pick up that can and take it out to the car. Cmon! Well it's about time. - What is it? - One sound out of you and you get it. Open Gorman's cell. Take his post mike. One move and your a dead hero. Open those two cells Can I give you a piece to speak. You better say it just right. Y'all get out of here if and when I say so. Make any noise and...(Indistinct). I want three of them out here. The rest of you stay put. Hey Dawson! Dawson! Dawson and gibbs are looking at some men that claim they're sick Maybe Wells better come and check on em. Ah they're faking Jack Bring em over here I'll find out they're sick or not (Instrumental music) Think all I gotta do is visit that stinkin' hole every time some con gets a belly ache. (Dropping) (Footsteps shuffling) (Instrumental music) (Door squeaks) Just a minute. (Dramatic music) (Indistinct) if they make any noise, blast 'em! (Dramatic music) (Door opens) All right Jesse? Smooth as a run outa here. Come on, Red! (Instrumental music) Hey Ed, what's all that rumpus in the warden's office? Guess Wells is roughin em up a little You better go see. Okay. (Suspenseful music) (Keys rattling) (Door closes) (Dramatic music) Through the door and get that gatling gun. You can make all the noise you want to now. Jess has taken over the whole prison. (Indistinct shouting) Maybe they'll sort of overlook Billy. Hired help. - Got 'em all? - Yep. They can holler their heads off. Won't do 'em any good. You will rest better on a horse heading for Mexico. Jesse, we need every minute. You musta heard that shooting in Yuma. No big rush man. Man don't get to be warden everyday. All right, you've had your big moment. On your feet. We got to get out of here. Peet's waiting with the horses. She's right Jess. She don't know the whole of it. And who you talking back to Red? I ain't talking back. I'm just saying that... Hey Jesse, none of them fit the dynamite lock. Better ask Morgan here. Yeah. - Dynamite, we don't need that. - Shut up! (Suspenseful music) Give me the key Morgan. - I haven't got it. - You know where it is. I want the key. I'm going to count one, two. Then you talk or I start killing every guard in the place. Commencing with Wells. Don't tell him nothing. Still not talking? - The key's in his pocket. - Get it Red. Why loose time blowing the place Jess? Yeah the whole town of Yuma will be out here. That what you think? Nah, Yuma won't come out here. Five hundred cows will be in Yuma. (Laughter) It'll be real funny. I turn them loose, they'll keep those folks so busy we can slow foot it to the border. - No posse after us or nothing. - That's slick. I'm gonna to try this key myself, Morgan. It better be the right key. (Dramatic music) (Door closes) (Instrumental music) Why don't you men get away while you can? Gorman's insane. You know that don't you? - Oh sure. - Just crazy enough to take your prison away from you, Morgan. Crazy enough to loose it back to me too. Then blame you for his failure. Come after you and kill you. Scared talk. Jesse knows what he's doing. First he takes care of Reynolds Then he turns the cons loose and then hes going to blow this joint to simthereens Funny huh? BIlly! Billy it's Abby! - What's gone wrong? - Jesse's gone out of his mind. He wants to turn the prisoners loose on Yuma. We've got to stop him. Our only chance to get the gatling gun. Try to work your way back to that door in the wall. You'll be all right? Yes, I'll try to stall Jesse. Get going. (Dramatic music) I'll take the sky right from them. They won't have no prison left. I'll make men better than they are. Jesse. - Mike and Stuffy know how to use dynamite. - Jesse, You seen Abby? Hmm? Abby went out of here some place. Huh? I told her to stay here. - Disobeying my orders. Joe. - Yeah. Take the stuff and give it to Mike and Stuffy. Tell 'em I want the whole layout blown sky high. You stay here, and I want that door on the wall kept locked. (Suspenseful music) - Well what do you think you're doing? - The doc's hurt. Bleeding bad. Never mind that. I told you to stay in the warden's office. - Doc's been good to me. - You obey orders just like anybody else. All right. Come with me. I got a little surprise for you. - Surprise? - I want you to see something funny. (Suspenseful music) This way. You promised you'd forget it Jesse. Things are different. Come on. And why are you so interested? Huh, I'm not. Except he hasn't got a gun or even a chance to run for it. Oh I'll give him a chance to run for it. Evening Mr. Reynolds. I hope you've still got running speed in your legs. Miss Nixon wants me to give you a chance. (Dramatic music) Who let 'em out? I don't know. He must have had a friend of one of the guards. - I don't know Jesse. - Quit lying Abby. You done it. Oh, that's crazy. I hate him. Why would I do a thing like that? Where's your gun? I don't know. I must have left it in the hospital. - You put me out of this so fast. - Stop! Now I know who warned him Bud and Cole was in town. Stuck on Nettles all the time. - No Jesse. - Double crossing no good little... Reynolds won't get very far. He's in my prison. I'll find him. And you're still going to Mexico with me. (Suspenseful music) Hey Red, come here. I got a special job for ya. Taker her to the warden's office and keep her there. - Abby, what's wrong? - She double crossed me. Turned Reynolds loose. What? I thought I heard a noise on the roof. Maybe he's hiding up there. He ain't that stupid. Take her in there. (Indistinct shouting) Hey Reynolds, you can't hide no place. I'll get ya. (Inmates shouting) Yeah! - You argue with him Pete. He might listen to you. It was time to leave 10 minutes ago. Jesse, are you out of your head? The boys are waiting with the horses. Let 'em wait. I got more unfinished business. No. - We ain't risking our necks on no rope. - He's talking sense Jesse. All this racket you raised. A posse will be starting from Yuma any minute now. I risked a lot. - Either you go with us now or I'll... - You'll what? (Suspenseful music) I owe you the favor. We'll go. Time to go. Let 'em all out! (Inmates shouting) Yay! (Shouting) (Yelling) (Gunshot) I'm running this. You get outa here when I say so. Anyone who don't obey orders will find me a whole lot meaner than Morgan. Jesse, you can make speeches in Mexico. Then I get the idea. How'd you boys like to spend the rest of the night in Yuma? (Cheering) (Indistinct)...and that's a win! (Shouting) Wanna get a free run of the hotel? (Yelling) (Gunshots) (Dramatic music) (Gunfire) (Gunfire) Give me that gun. That too. (Gunfire) Yellow bellies, scared of just one man? I'm gonna blow that dead one. Reynolds wait. (Dramatic music) (Rumbling) (Debris falling) Gate's open. Wide open! I told you I'd catch ya. I'm gonna splatter your brains all over that wall. (Gunshots) Now get back in your cells. Back! If the governor finds out how noble I am, maybe he'll cut my sentence to only 49 years. (Instrumental music) All right, come on. Back, back in there. Get 'em in and lock that cell block. (Instrumental music) (Dramatic music) (Romantic music) - Are you hurt bad? - No. No it's all right. Thanks Billy. Looks like we kind of wrecked your a gate warden. The governor will give me a new gate. Maybe I can persuade him to give me a couple of pardons too. Better get him to the hospital. (Instrumental music)
