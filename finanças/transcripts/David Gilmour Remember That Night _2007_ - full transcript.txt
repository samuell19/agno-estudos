Breathe, breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground For long you live and high you fly And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be Run, rabbit run Dig that hole, forget the sun And when at last the work is done Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine Staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run You missed the starting gun And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking And racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter Never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over Thought I'd something more to say Home, home again I like to be here when I can And when I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire And far away across the fields The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spells Thank you very much. Good evening to you. A few tunes from The Dark Side Of The Moon. We're going to play the whole of the recent record for you in the first half tonight. We'll play lots of better known stuff, for some of you, later on. This is On An Island. Thank you. Remember that night White steps in the moonlight They walked here too Through empty playground This ghosts' town Children again On rusting swings getting higher Sharing a dream On an island, it felt right We lay side by side Between the moon and the tide Mapping the stars for a while Let the night surround you We're halfway to the stars Ebb and flow Let it go Feel her warmth beside you Remember that night The warmth and the laughter Candles burned Though the church was deserted Al dawn we went down through empty streets to the harbour Dreamers may leave but they're here ever after Let the night surround you We're halfway to the stars Ebb and flow Let it go Feel her warmth beside you Thank you very much. Can I introduce you to Mr David Crosby and Mr Graham Nash? That was a song called On An Island, the title track. It's about how friends live on in your memories after they're gone. This is called The Blue. Shameless sea Aimlessly so blue Midnight-moon shines for you Still marooned Silence drifting through Nowhere to choose Just blue Ceaselessly Star-crossed you and me Save our souls We'll be forever blue Waves roll Lift us in blue Drift us Seep right through And colour us blue Wait for me Shameless you, the sea Soon, the blue So soon Soon, the blue So soon All the pieces fall into place When we walk these fields And I reach out and touch your face This earthly heaven is enough for me So break the bread and pour the wine I need no blessings but I'm counting mine Life is much more than money buys When I see the faith in my children's eyes I've felt the power in a holy place Wished for comfort when in need Now I'm here in a state of grace This earthly heaven is enough for me So break the bread and pour the wine I need no blessings but I'm counting mine So break the bread and pour the wine I need no blessings but I'm counting mine Life is much more than money buys When I see the faith in my children's eyes Mr Robert Wyatt playing the cornet for you here tonight. Right. Obviously, as well as Robert Wyatt, we have a few other people up here. We have Mr Dick Parry. Who I've been playing with, on and off, since we were teenagers. He played on Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here. As you all probably know. Next to him we have Mr Jon Carin. Who I played with at Live Aid in 1985. He's playing the keyboards, the slide guitar and he's singing. And I taught him everything he knows. To my far right, El Magnifico, Mr Phil Manzanera. Who helped produce the album we're performing for you this half. Next to him we have Mr Guy Pratt. On the bass guitar and on stand-up. Boom-boom. Next to him we have Mr Steve DiStanislao. Who I saw when Polly and I went to see Crosby & Nash last year at the Festival Hall. We just thought he was too good not to nick, so... And, of course, Mr Richard Wright. Right. This is a song called Smile. Would this do to make it all right While sleep has taken you where I'm out of sight I'll make my getaway Time on my own Search for a better way To find my way home to your smile Your smile Wasting days and days on this fight Always down And up half the night Hopeless to reminisce through the dark hours We'll only sacrifice what time will allow us You're sighing You're sighing All alone though you're right here Now it's time to go from your sad stare Make my getaway Time on my own Leaving's a better way To find my way home to your smile Your smile Take a breath Take a deep breath now Take a breath A deep breath now Take a breath Take a deep breath now Take a breath A deep breath now Take a breath Take a deep breath now Take a breath A deep breath now Take a breath Take a deep breath now Take a breath When you're down is where you find yourself When you drown there's nothing else When you're lost you'll need to turn yourself Then you'll find out that there's no one else To make the moves that you can do When you fall from grace your eyes in blue Your every breath becomes another world And the far horizon's living hell Take a breath Take a deep breath now Take a breath A deep breath now Take a breath Take a deep breath now Take a breath This kind of love is hard to find I never got to you by being kind If I'm the one to throw you overboard At least I showed you how to swim for shore When you're down is where you'll know yourself That if you drown there's nothing else When you're lost you need to find yourself Then you'll find out that there's no one else Take a breath He's sending stones skimming and flying Circles spinning out his time Though the earth is dying his head is in the stars Chances are this spark's a lifetime Out of touch he'll live in wonder Won't lose sleep, he'll just pretend In his world he won't go under Turns without him 'til the end Rivers run dry but there's no line on his brow Says he doesn't care who's saved It's just the dice you roll The here and now And he's not guilty or afraid One day he'll slip away Cool water flowing all around In the river and on the ground Leave a pocketful of stones and not believe in other lives Until then he'll live in wonder He won't fight or comprehend In his world he won't go under Turns without him until the end Where we start is where we end We step out sweetly with nothing planned Along by the river we feed bread to the swans And then over the footbridge to the woods beyond We walk ourselves weary You and | There's just this moment I light a campfire away from the path We lie in the bluebells A woodpecker laughs Time passes slowly Our hearts entwined All of the dark times left behind The day is done The sun sinks low We fold up the blanket It's time to go We walk ourselves weary Arm in arm Back through the twilight Home again We're home again We waltz in the moonlight and the embers' glow So much behind us Still far to go Still far to go Thank you very much indeed. We're gonna take a short break, about 20 minutes. We'll be right back. Remember when you were young You shone like the sun Shine on you crazy diamond Now there's a look in your eyes Like black holes in the sky Shine on you crazy diamond You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom Blown on the steel breeze Come on you target for faraway laughter Come on you stranger, you legend You martyr and shine You reached for the secret too soon You cried for the moon Shine on you crazy diamond Threatened by shadows at night And exposed in the light Shine on you crazy diamond Well, you wore out your welcome With random precision Rode on the steel breeze Come on you raver, you seer of visions Come on you painter, you piper You prisoner And shine Mr Dick Parry. This is Fat Old Sun. When the fat old sun in the sky is falling Summer evenin' birds are calling Summer Sunday and a year The sound of music in my ears Distant bells, new mown grass Smells so sweet By the river holding hands Roll me up and lay me down And if you sit don't make a sound Pick your feet up off the ground And if you hear as the warm night falls A silver sound from a tongue so strange Sing to me, sing to me When that fat old sun in the sky is falling Summer evenin' birds are calling Children's laughter in my ears The last sunlight disappears And if you sit don't make a sound Pick your feet up off the ground And if you hear as the warm night falls The silver sound from a time so strange Sing to me, sing to me Sing to me, sing to me Sing to me, sing to me Sing to me, sing to me Sing to me, sing to me Where were you when I was burned and broken While the days slipped by from my window watching And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless Because the things you say and the things you do surround me While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words Dying to believe in what you heard I was staring straight into the shining sun Lost in thought and lost in time While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted Outside the rain fell dark and slow While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the moment had arrived For killing the past and coming back to life I took a heavenly ride through our silence I knew the waiting had begun And I headed straight into the shining sun Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the Division Bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before time took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed-of world Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There's a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we've been SO many times The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river Forever and ever Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air And deep beneath the rolling waves In labyrinths of coral caves The echo of a distant time Comes willowing across the sand And everything is green and submarine And no one showed us to the land And no one knows the wheres or whys But something stirs and something tries And starts to climb towards the light Strangers passing in the street By chance two separate glances meet And I am you and what I see is me And do I take you by the hand And lead you through the land And help me understand the best I can And no one calls us to move on And no one forces down our eyes And no-one speaks and no-one tries And no one flies around the sun Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes Inviting and inciting me to rise And through the window in the wall Come streaming in on sunlight wings A million bright ambassadors of morning And no one sings me lullabies And no one makes me close my eyes So I throw the windows wide And call to you across the sky So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell Blue skies from pain Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change And did you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl Year after year Running over the same old ground What have we found The same old fears Wish you were here Thank you very much indeed. Just inviting David and Graham back up here. We're going to sing one of their songs for you now. This song is for old times. Find the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body down Find the cost of freedom Buried in the ground Mother Earth will swallow you Lay your body down Before we finish... I'd like to invite Mr David Bowie up here to sing a song for you. Thank you very much. I hope I warrant that. Any time, David. David Gilmour. Thank you so much for the invitation. Thank you. One more? Hello Is there anybody in there Just nod if you can hear me Is there anyone at home Come on now I hear you're feeling down Well, I can ease your pain Get you on your feet again Relax I'll need some information first Just the basic facts Can you show me where it hurts There is no pain, you are receding A distant ship's smoke on the horizon You are only coming through in waves Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying When I was a child I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons Now ['ve got that feeling once again I can't explain, you would not understand This is not how [ am I have become comfortably numb I have become comfortably numb Okay Just a little pin prick There'll be no more But you may feel a little sick Can you stand up I do believe it's working, good That'll keep you going through the show Come on, it's time to go There is no pain you are receding A distant ship's smoke on the horizon You are only coming through in waves Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse Out of the corner of my eye I turned to look but it was gone I cannot put my finger on it now The child is grown The dream is gone And I have become comfortably numb Thank you very much indeed. Good night to you. Thank you very much indeed. Good night.
