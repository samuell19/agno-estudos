Director:All right, let's get last looks on these guys and let's do it again. and action. Santa:(laughs) Herman:Gees, Santa. Only a few billion left to go on the naughty list spreadsheet and you're already dozing off again. Director:Cut! All right, let's go back to one, people! And try it again, please? Action! Santa:(snores and laughs) (coughs) Herman:Gees, Santa. Only a few billion left to go on the naughty list spreadsheet and you're already dozing off again. Santa:I gotta check it twice but- Director:Cut! Nick! Great stuff. The ho's, really fantastic, don't change a thing. Herman on this next tape, I want you to think about the children of the world, walking down, Christmas Day, to find their trees empty because you haven't done your job by waking Santa up to check the naughty list! Herman, god forbid! A nice kid ends up there by accident! Let's try it again, guys! All right! Take it back. This is the martini. We're gonna finish it up, wrap it up, put a ribbon on it. Okay, and rolling and action! Herman:Gees, Santa! Only a few billion left to go on the naughty list spreadsheet Director:You know, I don't wanna be here. Do you wanna be here? Crew guy:I don't know man. This sucks. Director:I know, it's an energy drink. Herman:The only way to make it around the world is with this! The only energy drink with the legal limit of nitroglycerine! Santa:(chuckles) Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Herman:Rocket Fuel! The cure for the common suck! Director:And cut! Herman! Nailed it buddy. Thank you so much. I really believe that you are one of Santa's elves and not a midget. Herman:Please don't call me that. Director:Guys, can we check the gate? Crew guy:Gate's good! Director:Good gate! That's a wrap, guys. Thank you so much, really great stuff.

Miller:Hey, you! Herman:I've got a top order table. Probably displaying I heart New York t-shirts. Miller:Oh, do not be afraid to add gratuity to their bill. Herman:One step ahead of you. So, how's the boyfriend thing? Miller:Ah, we broke up. Herman:What happened? Miller:Turns out, he doesn't like me. I really thought this one was going somewhere. Herman:Don't be so hard on yourself. It's just a few weeks. Miller:Six. But my first kiss was at my door. Ah, my door. I'm used to it being in a bar. I keep getting into these relationships that go absolutely nowhere and I should probably just be single for the rest of my life. Hey, so how was your commercial? Herman:Oh, another day of candy cane Spandex. Miller:It's your third elf shoot this month. Herman:Hey, when your ass looks this good in tights, speed dial. (Miller chuckles) How's your audition? Miller:Um, I didn't go. Herman:Miller! Miller:The role was for me to seduce some Russian thug. I am not a seductress. I cannot seduce anything and I get all nervous and insecure and then my hands are shaking and I just, I can't deal with it. Herman:Maybe you can play somebody extremely cold. Miller:(chuckles) I don't know I think I need an agent or something. Herman:I gave you Tyrone's number. Miller:I said an agent, not a pimp. Herman:There you go. And now, what can I get you? Tourist Mom:I'd like to have a green salad please. Tourist Dad:And I'll have the grilled rib-eye, extra well. Tourist Mom:Honey, I thought we were on a budget? Tourist Dad:We are on a budget. Make this a two-income household instead of one-income, we would have more budget conversations. Tourist Son:(scoffs) You're such a hypocrite! Tourist Dad:Say it again and we're gonna yank you out of that frou-frou school that taught you that word. Tourist Son:I'm not afraid of you! Tourist Dad:Yes, you are. Herman:I'll go put your orders in. Juan:Hey, Mr. Herman. Herman:Juan, how are you? Juan:Fine, thank you. How was your commercial? Herman:Oh, I'm already tired of talking about it. How about you though? Have you seen any movies you can recommend? Juan:I went to [film fare] last week and I saw a great French one by Truffaut. Herman:You know French? Juan:I read the subtitles. Herman:Subtitles, oh. That's too much multitasking for me. Juan:Hey, Mr. Herman. If you're not busy, could you please take this up to the bar? Herman:Sure. Juan:Thank you, Mr. Herman. Herman:No problem, my friend. Pete:You meet anybody then? Customer:Yep. Pete:Really. Somebody saw? I knew that. Oh, thanks, little man. I was getting pretty low. Oh, that was funny. Come on, you get it? Herman:Yeah, my name is Herman. Pete:Well, my name is Pete. Nice to meet you. Herman:Haven't seen you here before. Pete:You're right, you haven't. First day. Herman:It's a great place to work. Pete:Beats unemployment and used to be a producer over at Rachael Ray. Herman:Never seen it. Pete:Never seen Rachael Ray? She's a cultural icon. I mean who else could say that they cook homemade ravioli during an interview with [Cole Cody]- Herman:Sorry, dude. If Ryan Seacrest isn't hosting, I'm not watching. Pete:Seacrest, man. Yeah, well, Rach might be a little high brow for you anyway. Herman:Enjoy your clean glasses. Pete:All right, thanks, little man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Little man, come on back here. Do me a favor and run these things back to the kitchen, there's spots all over them. Herman:First off, I'm not your busboy, secondly, my mother owns this restaurant, so you might wanna try remembering my name. Pete:Wait, your mom owns this restaurant. Herman:Yup. Juan:[sings in foreign language] Herman:Juan, have you seen Gregg? Juan:I think he went to the storage room. Gregg:(sobbing) Herman:What are you doing? Order up. Gregg:Herman I can't. Something terrible has happened. Herman:You can't react this way every time somebody sends a dish back. Gregg:Herman, that happened two times. Three maybe. Herman:So, what's wrong? Gregg:(cries) Herman. Herman:Gregg, I don't have time for a guessing game. Come on. Gregg:Mom died. (funeral music) Bouncer:And where are you going, little man? Herman:It's my mother's wake. Bouncer:Not until I see some ID. Herman:For what? Bouncer:For the open bar. Everybody's up on the roof. Hula Girl:Aloha! Herman:No thanks. I didn't come here to get laid. [inaudible conversation] Pelvis:(singing Hawaiian song) Tyrone, who invited you? Tyrone:Ha, ha, Herman! I heard the news. Sorry about your mama, baby. Herman:Yeah, me too. Tyrone:Well, how'd you do on that Rocket Fuel commercial thing? You make us some money. Herman:Your 15%'s in the mail. Tyrone:Oh really? See, I thought we agreed on 50. All right, I'm just messing with you. Herman:Where is the casket? Tyrone:I think I saw a floatie over there (chuckles). Hey, I don't know if this is a good time to talk business- Herman:It's not. Tyrone:All right. I got you an audition for a made-for-TV Christmas movie, Santa Claus gets arrested for using child labor when the elves go on a union strike. You're gonna a tiny teamster baby. A gumdrop Jimmy Hoffa. Herman:I'm speechless. Tyrone:Hey, come on, Herman. Let me buy you a drink. It's on me. Herman:I'll pass. Pelvis:(singing Hawaiian song) Miller:Hey, you. Aww. I'm sorry for your loss. How you holding up? Herman:I thought I'd feel really depressed today but when I walked in and saw that coconut bikini right here, all seems right in the world. Miller:The hula girl got confidence. Herman:Truly. Miller:I didn't think they'd be celebrating your mom's passing like this. Herman:Miller, it's news to me too. Miller:It's a really fun party though. Herman:Miller. Miller:Mm? Herman:Have you seen Gregg? I need to have a few words with him. Gregg:Attention, attention. Can I have everybody's attention please? Hello, my name is Gregg Campieche. Camilla is my mother. I am her youngest son. You know, all our lives, my older brother Herman and I wanted to bring our mother to the tropical island paradise of Hawaii. We wanted to have the wind blow through our hair, have the sand in between our toes, the sun basting our skin like a butterball turkey (chuckles) but that never happened. So, today, I wanted to bring Waikiki to her. (chuckles) And now, I'd like to raise a toast, mm? To a wonderful woman, a loving mother, and my best friend, Camilla Rose Mitchell Campieche. Mm, oh my god. This is like a party in your mouth everybody. (chuckles) Oh, this is my older brother, Herman. Herman, do you wanna say a few words? Herman:What the hell is wrong with you? Mom never asked for a carnival. Gregg:I thought this would be thoughtful. Why are you trying to ruin it? Herman:Why is mom orange?! Gregg:I had the mortician give her a spray tan. I didn't want her to look pasty in her own wake. Herman:You're sick! Sick! Gregg:Herman, this was going really well. What, are you just jealous because I look like the better son? Herman:I'm this close to shoving that palm tree so far up your ass, you'll be coughing up coconut milk! Gregg:It's a plastic pineapple tree. There is no coconut milk in it. (everyone gasps) Herman:You're next! Gregg:Oh, aww! Tyrone:Who's got the bets for the little guy! Miller:Stop it! Enough! Enough! (everyone talking and screaming) Stop! Bouncer:Take this outside! Herman:Gregg, come on! Miller, bring the palm tree! Gregg:Ah, nothing like a death to cause a family squabble, right? Please everyone have a drink. Enjoy yourselves. For the love of god, play Pelvis. Play! (lively ukulele music) Pelvis:[sings in foreign language] Herman:Put me down! Bouncer:Go check yourself before you wreck yourself. Herman:I'm gonna wreck something all right! You! Over here! Gregg:Herman, I don't know why you're so angry. Herman:Seriously- Lawyer Ron:Gentlemen. Herman:Who are you? Lawyer Ron:I was your mother's attorney. You must be Herman. Ron [Wilidies Pinky] esquire At Gregg's request, I've come to explain your mother's last will and testament. Shall we go inside? Gregg:You know what, we're having some issues upstairs. Why don't we just discuss it here? On the veranda, here have a seat, Herman. Herman:I'll stand. Lawyer Ron:No one wants to deal with legal proceedings, especially on the sidewalk but so it goes. Gregg, I'll start with you. You and your mother shared the same passion for food and hospitality, so you will inherit the family business. Gregg:Thank you, mom. Herman:What else? Lawyer Ron:The remainder of her personal possessions have been donated to the Helping Hands Halfway House in Yonkers. Herman:So, I'm left with? Lawyer Ron:The directive. Herman:The directive. Lawyer Ron:Your mother's dying wish was that you take your acting career more seriously. No longer settling via punch line at the end of some bad joke. She wanted nothing more than you be successful and know you did it on your own. No handicaps Herman. Herman:Let me be perfectly clear, Gregg has inherited the thriving business and one of the most expensive markets in the entire country, the rest of my mother's state has been given to some homeless people in Yonkers and all I'm left with is a worthless dying wish? Lawyer Ron:That's correct but you will get a copy. Gregg:If you ever need to work at my restaurant, you're welcome. Herman:I'm gonna kill you. Lawyer Ron:Let's have a drink. Gregg:Yes, a drink sounds good. (sad piano music) Miller:Hey, you! Herman:Hey. Miller:Pretty shitty day, huh? Herman:Yeah, to say the least. Miller:I'm so sorry. Herman:This is the best part. (Tyrone laughing) Tyrone:Damn boy! Check this out. I just got a sweet tweet about a role that's perfect for you. I'm talking this is the apex, baby. The pinnacle, the crème de la crme- Herman:Spit it out. Tyrone:My boy, Marty Scorsese is doing a remake of the Wizard of Oz and you're gonna be playing, the mayor of Munchkin Land. Herman:Is Leonardo DiCaprio playing Dorothy? Tyrone:Come on, Herman baby. We gotta roll on this. The audition is tomorrow. Herman:Tomorrow's my birthday. Tyrone:And this is your present. Look, you got two options. You can sit here and have a little pity party with ice cream and cake or you can follow the yellow brick road right on down to fame and fortune. Miller:Okay, I don't know what his answer is but he's done talking to you right now. Tyrone:Hey, nobody's gonna stop Tyrone Valentine from communicating with his client. Miller:Is this guy for real? Tyrone:Live and in living color. Miller:All right, come buy me some ice cream. Herman:Sounds good. Tyrone:Herman, baby. Give me a call, all right? Miller:Oh my god, my feet hurts so bad. Herman:Why are you wearing those? Miller:Because they elongate my leg. Herman:You're fooling yourself. Miller:Hey, I didn't say anything to you when you went to a Pilates class yesterday. Herman:That's cold. Mom left Gregg everything. Miller:What? Herman:I got a directive. Miller:What does that mean? Herman:A directive to stop wasting my life and finally pursue my acting career. Miller:Oh my god, that's great. Herman:It felt more like a slap in the face. Miller:Or a swift kick in the ass, you know, in a good way. Herman:I mean do I need that though? I mean I get that on a daily basis. Miller:I know, I think Herman, this is exactly what you need to stop playing it safe, you know? Herman:I can't help that I'm constantly offered small roles, pun intended. Miller:Are you gonna audition to be a Munchkin tomorrow? Herman:Oh, not just a Munchkin, mayor of Munchkin Land. I mean there is a hierarchy that deserves to be recognized here. Miller:Well, I think you should go for something bigger than that. Like I think there's lots of roles in the Wizard of Oz and that you could be the Lion. Herman:That's unbelievable. Miller:Why can't the Lion be little? Herman:A little lion with no courage, takes away the irony of the character, that's why. And they're not gonna make a short, scarecrow with the intention of keeping away birds. Miller:Okay, well, you could be the Tin Man. He's just a dude looking for a heart. That's perfect for you. Herman:You look fat in that dress. Miller:I think you'd make an adorable Tin Man. Herman:You think I would make an adorable everything. (Miller laughs) Is anyone else gonna buy it? Miller:I don't know but you won't either until you try. I look great in this dress. Thank you for walking me home and the ice cream. Herman:Any time. Miller:High five. Herman:Smart ass. Miller:(giggles) Goodnight. Herman:Goodnight. Miller:Herman! Herman:Yeah? You should listen to your mother. You're good enough to be a leading man. Herman:I'll audition for the tin man if you come with me tomorrow. Miller:It's a date. And who knows, maybe I'll read for Dorothy. Herman:Dorothy with hypothermia? Miller:Goodnight! (Herman laughs) (light music) Herman:Excuse me. Could you help me reach something please? Beer Lady:Sure, honeybun. What would you like? Herman:Um, that beer right there on the top shelf. Beer Lady:Oh, beer (laughs). You know, the Babylonians, they were the first brewers. They took their beer brewing so seriously. Do you know what would happen if you mess up a batch of beer? They would drown you in it. (laughs) Herman:Oh. Um, yeah, could you just pass me the the Brooklyn IPA? Beer Lady:You betcha (giggles). There you go. Herman:So much thank you. Beer Lady:You are so welcome. Herman:Thanks very- Beer Lady:Yeah, I get that too when I get drunk. Have you ever been drunk before? Herman:Once or twice. Beer Lady:I think it's so much more fun to get drunk with people than [cats]. (both laughs) Herman:Yeah, yeah. Beer Lady:You know the Vikings, they believe that there was a giant goat whose tits were filled with beer that would wait for them in heaven. Herman:Hmm. Beer Lady:Do you believe in heaven, little guy? Herman:Okay, goodnight. You must've sent this before you died. Another dollar older. Didn't get it all, Gregg. Didn't get it all. (television playing) Crew woman:Next! Cliff:Herman, what's up? Herman:Not much, Cliff. Cliff:I heard you got the Rocket Fuel commercial. Herman:I did. Cliff:I would die for that job. So, what else is new? Herman:My mother just died. Cliff:Oh, man! Herman:Hey, Miller! Um, do you mind if she Cliff:Oh, yeah, sure. Miller:Happy birthday! Herman:Welcome to Munchkin Land. (Miller giggles) For future reference, this is what it's like to wait for an audition. Miller:Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm so nervous and I'm not even auditioning. (laughs) My hands are shaking. Look! That is no joke. Are you nervous? Herman:Apparently, you haven't learned the secret of mastering anxiety. Just a little swig of liquid courage, always seems to do the trick. Miller:I see become an alcoholic. No, thank you. (both laughing) Cliff:Hi! Miller:Oh, hi! Cliff:I'm Cliff. Miller:Hey, Miller. Nice to meet you. Cliff:Likewise. So, you two um, together? Miller:What? Herman:What do you mean, Cliff? Cliff:Are you bf/gf? Miller:Boyfriend, girlfriend? Herman:Ah, we're just friends. Cliff:Oh, so you're single. Miller:Oh, Cliff, Cliff, Cliff. I wish you wouldn't have brought up, the bf/gf with Herman and I because I was going to have a conversation about raising the level of our relationship right after your audition, Herman. And now, look what you've done, you, cat's out of the bag. Herman:I knew you were hot for me. Actor :Herman, you're next. Herman:Oh, thanks. I'll return, my sweet. Miller:I'll be waiting. High five, go get 'em! Cliff:Hi, my friends say I got a big mouth. Miller:The damage is done, Cliff. Back it up. Director:Okay, so, we're going to have you say your name to the camera and then you can take it from there. Herman:Before we get started, I was wondering, are there any other roles that I could audition for besides mayor of Munchkin Land? Director:We're also considering you for Munchkin violinist number two and for the Munchkin treasurer of the Lollipop Guild. Herman:Let me rephrase that, are there any other rules available without the word, Munchkin? Director:Well, you can read for one of the winged monkeys. Herman:Actually, I was hoping to get a chance to read for the Tin Man. Director:Sorry, you're not the right shape. Herman:With all due respect, he's just a guy looking for a heart. Director:Look, you know what, there are a lot of people waiting outside, do you wanna audition or not? Herman:I just wanna know why I have to be typecast, I, I- Director:Next! Herman:I'm not leaving until I get a shot. Director:Get him out my sight. Herman:I just want 30 seconds. 30 seconds, I could read for the Tin Man, I think you'd be really happy with it. Director:You have 30 seconds to go. Herman:No, I would really like to read- Come on, I just want- No, I'm thinking in 30 seconds, I could really show you something, I just want another chance! Miller:You nailed it? Herman:This was a bad idea. Miller:Hollywood's not gonna change overnight, Herman. Herman:That's for sure. Miller:(sighs) (people laughing and talking) Herman:Hello, what may I get for the two of you? Wine Snob:Nothing but a bottle of red, something full-bodied, a generous of amount of fruit, well integrated [tannin] scent and orgasmic finish. Herman:What's your price range, sir? Wine Snob:Don't insult me. Herman:I've got just the wine for the two of you. Wine Snob:(chuckles) Okay, we'll see. Pete:Yeah, that chick's smoking man. Herman:Pete, I need a bottle of Barbaresco. Pete:Barbaresco. Herman:Mm-hmm. Pete:I'll get it for you if you can tell me the color of her tong. You know it, don't you? You dog, you! Herman:Sorry, she's sworn me to secrecy. Pete:Oh, you. Seriously, dude, if I was your height, I'd use it to my full advantage. You know what I'm saying right? Herman:I hope you don't charge for your advice. Pete:Hey, for you little man, it's on the house. Go get 'em buddy. It's red, isn't it? Wine Snob:So, my investment broker says, "Congratulations, your portfolios increased "by 25%." and I said, "Good luck finding "a new job, asswipe" (laughs). Herman:Here you are. Wine Snob:Yeah, yeah. What? Couldn't reach the top shelf? Herman:Sir, it must be truly hard to savor a fine wine when you're so full of shit! Wine Snob:I demand to speak to your manager, I will not be talked down to by a midget. Miller:Shit! Wine Snob:Maybe he'll bring back the other six dwarfs. That was a Snow White reference, do you know that movie? Gregg:* (lyrics) Oh, making some [poblano] Oh, you'll just have to wait for my [poblano] Um, oh my [poblano] and my [poblano] oh, oh. Okay. What's going on Mr. Herman man? * Hey, why are you running into the storeroom? Was it my singing? Herman:Nothing. It's been I needed some space, it's been a long day. Gregg:Okay, something happened? Herman:No, I'm fine. Nothing happened. Gregg:All right. Well, if you need me, I'll be slinging hash. (chuckles) Miller:Hey, what's going on? Gregg:Oh, Herman needs some space. Miller:Why? Because that douche bag at table 12 called you the "M" word? Gregg:What? Oh, hell no. Miller:Herman? Come on, don't let it get to you. Herman:Every day, every day Miller. Miller:No, it's stupid. They're stupid. They don't know better. Don't let them get you down on your birthday. Herman:Screw my birthday. 36. What do I have to show for it? I'm working in this place. No matter how hard you try, no matter how much you push, it doesn't matter. Look at me. What do you see? Miller:I see my friend. Herman:I see a freak. Everybody else sees a freak, Miller. Miller:No, no. They just- Herman:I'm a freak! Miller:Okay, Herman, you are not a freak and I will not let my friend talk about himself that way anymore. You've got to stop paying attention to everybody else and focus on what's good In your life. You are paying attention to the wrong things Herman. Herman:How do I stop? How do I stop when it's down my throat every second? Miller:People are gonna stare at you. People are gonna call you names. People are gonna do things to you. Little kids are gonna poke at you and be like, "What's wrong with that guy?" That is your lot in life. You have to ignore all the bullshit. Like just ignore the bullshit and focus on you. Herman:Yeah. Miller:Every day Herman. Every day, I will help you. Herman:Okay. Miller:Does my makeup look like shit or am I fine? Herman:Miller. Miller:What? Herman:You look great. Miller:Okay. I'm gonna go back to my tables. Herman:Thank you Miller. Miller:High fives? Herman:You're such a smart ass. (Miller laughs) Wine Snob:Oh, you're cold? Yeah, of course you can wear my jacket but I'm just gonna be peeling it off you later. I'm talking about porking. Gregg:Hello, my name is Gregg Campieche. Is there something I can help you with? Wine Snob:Yes, I don't care that you employ handicapped people but I don't tolerate bad service. And I'm not paying for this bottle of wine. Gregg:Is there something wrong with the wine? Customer:I lived in Piamonte for three years. plucked Nebbiolos from the vine. I know what this is supposed to taste like and serving me a 2004 bottle of Barbaresco is like asking Beethoven to sit down at the Steinway and play Chopsticks. Gregg:You are a classy individual and I apologize for anything you may have experienced. There's something, hmm. Oh, wow. Mm, mm-hmm. Listen here, your vulgar behavior made me do this. Now, take your bushy nipple dick out of here, you asshole. (phone ringing) Herman:What Tyrone?! Tyrone:What kind of shit is you smoking? I just got a call from my casting peeps and they said they had to throw you out of an audition. You're trying to get us both blacklisted? Herman:Did you hear how they treated me? Tyrone:Herman, this is show business. So, I'm gonna be real with you. When you get paid, my family gets paid. There is no way that you're gonna get an audition for the Tin Man. That's like me, trying to audition for the remake of Gandhi. That shit just ain't gonna happen. Nobody is gonna let you headlight your own movie unless you foot the bill and do it yourself. Now, check this out. Lucky Charms is looking for a new face. How do you feel about leprechauns? Because they're gonna can that cartoon and go with live action. but you know what, we'll talk about that later because you are cutting into my bubble time. Miller:Doing a stellar job on your napkin folding. Hey, Herman. You gotta pay the rent. I can't pay the rent. You gotta pay the rent. I'll pay the rent. My hero! Hey, everybody [get out of my door] What are you doing here? She's got to pay the rent. Why are you paying her rent? Because I think she's real pretty. Hey, you guys looking for a good time? Oh, I'm knife face. I got a knife on my face. Seriously, my throat or my [unintelligible]. Herman:I don't think we can use this anymore. Tyrone has another audition for me. Miller:Oh, brother. Herman:Mm-hmm. I'm going to be a leprechaun! Miller:You cannot do that. Herman:That's not what he says. Miller:Seriously, Herman. You have got to start playing roles that show what you're capable of. If you're gonna be the leading man, you have to do other things. Herman:I've tried Miller. Miller:One time. What, you're just gonna give up? Herman:It's a dead end dummy. The casting director wouldn't even let me read for the Tin Man. Miller:So, go above the casting director. They don't make all the decisions. Herman:I don't know Martin Scorsese. Pete:I can get to him. Herman:How? Pete:Inside information. Turns out Marty is doing an unscheduled appearance on Rachael Ray this week. I could drop off an audition tape for you. Miller:Martin Scorsese is doing the Rachael Ray Show? Does he cook? But you don't work there anymore. Pete:Hey, I'm in the industry. One call. Miller:Okay, that's awesome. We can do something from the Wizard of Oz. Pete:Great. I can direct it. Miller:Really? Herman:I think I want Juan to be the director. Juan:Uh, Mr. Herman, Pete has a lot of experience, I only have a subscription to Netflix. Herman:Yeah, but I need somebody I can trust. You know more about film than any of my friends. Juan, will you direct my audition tape? Juan:If you want me to, sure. Miller:Well, Pete, you could be the cameraman. Pete:Um, yeah, sure, I can do that. Fine. Herman:I need a very talented young actress to play opposite me. Miller:Oh. (chuckles) Thank you very much. You are talking about me, right? Herman:Yeah. Gregg:Happy birthday! Both:Tanti auguri, it's your special day. You're older! Miller:Okay, make a wish. Gregg:Ohh! (Miller laughs) So what'd you wish for? Herman:Can I shoot an audition tape for Martin Scorsese at the restaurant, please? Gregg:What? (chuckles) I mean I can't just shut the restaurant down for an entire day. (chuckles) Miller:Please Gregg, it's for the Wizard of Oz and we could do it after hours. Gregg:Well Well, okay. But only if I can play the Lion. I just really feel like I'm the king of the forest. Herman:Deal. (Gregg laughs) Gregg:I'm gonna be a star. (laughs) Seriously, you're not done wrapping the silverware? Miller:Sorry. Gregg:Can we really wrap these up? I do pay you, so. Miller:Okay. This is gonna be fun. Gregg:You know, if you really wanna catch Scorsese's eye, you need some costumes that pop. Herman:You can be in charge of that. I still need to pick out a scene for us to do. Pete:Why don't you ask your buddy Juan for advice. He's the expert. Herman:You know, that's a good idea. Juan, you're coming home with me. Juan:When? Herman:Right now. We got work to do. Miller:All right. I'm going home. Goodnight. Keep me posted. I'm exhausted. Pete:Hey, I'll I'll walk with you. Miller:Okay, sure. Pete:Hey, have fun gentlemen. Gregg:Well, they make a cute couple. Herman:No, they don't, Gregg. Shut your mouth. Not even close. Gregg:Well, I'm gonna watch some trashy TV. Pete:So Miller:Oh (both chuckles). Pete:You and the little man seem pretty close. Miller:Herman? Yeah, we've known each other a long time. Pete:Any romance? Huh? Ha-ha? (Miller chuckles) Miller:No, he's one of my best friends. Pete:Best friends, come on. Somebody's always gonna like someone. Miller:That's not true. It doesn't always have to be some hidden agenda when it comes to the opposite sex. Pete:Yeah, it does when of them looks like him. Miller:(laughs) Okay. What's your deal? Where are you from? Pete:I'm just a dude made in America. All right, I'll tell you where I'm from if I can buy you a beer. Miller:Okay. Pete:What do you drink, stout? (chuckles) Miller:I actually, prefer long necks. Herman:All I have is IPA. Juan:Oh, no. Thank you Mr. Herman. I don't drink alcohol. Herman:Well, then I'll just have one for both of us. Juan:Sure. Herman:So, Juan, any ladies in your life? Juan:Only one, my wife back in Mexico City. Actually, I have a picture of her. Herman:Wow. How come I never noticed a ring on your finger? Juan:Well, I sold it. To send money back to my family. Herman:I see. So, do you think Miller likes Pete? Juan:What? I don't know. I can't see anything back in the kitchen. Herman:Yeah, but did you see the way Pete was acting around her when they left tonight? Juan:I just thought he was being a gentleman by walking her home. Herman:You're being deceived my friend. Listen, we gotta save Miller. The only reason Pete's helping out with this project is because he wants to get in her pants. He doesn't care about you or me. I'm not dogging Pete here. All I'm saying is that Miller's too good for him. She deserves to be with someone who will treat her with respect and appreciate her for who she is. Now, is there any way we can articulate that in the scene? Juan:Sounds like you want romance. Herman:Yes! Juan:Mr. Herman, the Wizard of Oz is not a love story. Herman:It is tonight, Juan. We're gonna write a new scene with Tin Man and Dorothy. Two friends who deserved to be together. They're destined to be together. Except one of them doesn't know yet. Dorothy is blind to the truth and the only way that the Tin Man can open the eyes of his fair maiden is to kiss her. Kiss her before Pete does. Juan:Wait, what? Herman:This one's for you, Juan. (playful music) (easy listening rock music) Miller:Cheers. (chuckles) Pete:Cheers. Whoa, whoa, ojos. Miller:Ojos? Pete:Juan taught me that. We gotta do it again. Gotta make the eye contact with the cheers. Miller:Oh, eye contact. Okay, all right, sorry. Cheers. Pete:Hmm. Miller:You didn't drink. Pete:Oh, sorry about that,. I got distracted with those eyes of yours. Miller:(chuckles) You're stupid. Pete:Mm-hmm. (Miller laughs) [I don't know but you have a point.] Miller:Oh, I'm scared. Pete:You know, you should be. Yeah, it's no big deal. Miller:Okay, what? What is it? Pete:Smile if you wanna kiss me. Yeah, I thought so. Miller:It's happening at a bar. (Herman snoring) (phone ringing) Herman:Juan. Juan, what are you doing here? Hello? Miller:Hey, you! Herman:Who is this? Miller:It's Miller. Herman:Hey, Miller. What's up? Miller:I was just reading your script. Herman:Huh? Miller:The scene we're shooting for your audition. Herman:Yeah, I'm still trying to pick it out. Miller:Oh, you already e-mailed it to me, you silly butt (laughs). Herman:I did? Miller:Yeah, (laughs). Hey, I thought we were gonna just do something from the Wizard of Oz. I didn't think that you're actually gonna write an entire scene. Herman:Juan, we e-mailed the script to Miller? Juan:I didn't send it to her. Miller:I should probably listen to some Ray Charles or walk around my apartment in the dark or something like that. Herman:Can you hold on for a second? We wrote a story about a blind girl? Juan:It was your idea. Herman:I was drunk. Juan:Drunk? You had only two beers. Herman:So, uh, what what'd you like about it? Miller:Oh, Dorothy having to go blind so she can see the Tin Man for who he truly is, I love it. Herman, it's great! Herman:Oh, you know, we were We were looking for something with a little more depth. You don't really find that in the original. Miller:Hey, what are you doing right now? Because we should probably run these lines as soon as possible. Herman:Yeah, sure, sure. I can meet you. Miller:Okay, great. I'm at Toast. So, get here because I'm starving. Herman:All right. Miller:Mm! Thank you for meeting me on such short notice. Herman:No, thank you. Miller, I truly appreciate all you're doing for this. Thank you very much. And you, you look beautiful. Miller:Aw, Herman. Hey, do you mind if I run to the bathroom real quick? I've been holding it in for a while. Herman:Of course. Miller:Okay, good. Don't you dare. You know how I feel about that. I got eyes at the back of my head, Herman. Pete:Hey, little man! How's it going? Herman:What are you doing here? Pete:Miller said you guys are running lines. Thought I'd listen in. So I can visualize the shots. Herman:You can do that from just reading the script? Pete:I could but it jumps off the page when you hear the actors say it, you know. Herman:Yeah. So, the two of you been hanging out? Just the two of you? Pete:I got a late start this morning and Miller was starving so I came over here. Herman:What'd you do last night? Pete:We hung out. Herman:Just hung out? Pete:I very much enjoyed getting to know her better. Herman:Well, how much better do you know her now? Pete:Well, let's just say that I spent the night at her place. So, how's your love life, little man? Herman:It's okay. You know, I'm playing the field right now. Keeping my options open. I have a lot on my plate. Pete:Hey, so I wanna ask you. How do you guys hook up, you know, you people? Herman:My people? Pete:Yeah. Herman:Well, every Christmas, we meet at the north pole. We mix, mingle and mate and then we slip back into the wilderness. You know, like marching penguins. Pete:That movie sucked. Miller:So, what did I miss? Pete:Hey. Miller:Hi. Pete:We're just shooting the shot. Herman:Yeah, just shooting the shot. Miller:Okay! Let's get started. Herman, when we get to the kissing part, we'll just be like, lalalalala, we're kissing. Herman:Yeah, of course. What page is that? Miller:Page three. When Tin Man confesses his love to Dorothy. Pete:Right. I didn't know there was a kissing scene in the Wizard of Oz. Herman:Well, we We tweaked it a little. Juan and I did. Just kinda give it a little pop. Punch it up a little bit, you know. Pete:You rewrote Wizard of Oz. Miller:Pete, you know, they worked really They worked really hard on it. Pete:I'm just saying it's an American classic. Isn't it a little weird to be rewriting it? Herman:Yeah, it's you know, children's story and we just thought it needed a little more flavor. I wanted to show my range. I was trying to prove myself, you know, be a leading man. Miller:Mm-hmm. Pete:Mm-hmm. I see leading man written all over him. Miller:Anyone else hungry? I feel like kind weird that no one eating. Herman:No, suddenly I've lost my appetite. Miller:Really? Well, I could go for some eggs right now. Pete:Salad maybe? Miller:And some turkey bacon. Mm-mm. Herman:I'd like a good stiff drink really. Miller:Okay. Kinda early for that, right? Herman:Not for me. (upbeat music) (Gregg chuckles) Juan:So, Gregg, how do you know the designer again? Gregg:Oh, he was college roommate but now, he designs costumes for Broadway shows. Strawberry:Greggory? Oh, (laughs loudly) oh, you old show queen. Gregg:Hi, Strawberry. Strawberry:Oh my goodness, you got taller? Gregg:No, thinner. (both laughs) Strawberry:Maybe that's it. Maybe that's it. Gregg:Anyway, thank you so much for doing this. Strawberry:Oh, are you kidding me? It is my absolute pleasure. I already have your costume ready. It was one of the prototypes that I pitched when I was originally working on the Lion King. Julie Taymor, did not like it. Gregg:Well, she's a fool because I have jungle fever. (both laughing) Juan:Are you feeling all right? Should I call a doctor? (Strawberry laughing loudly) Strawberry:Oh, you are delicious, Juan. Can I keep this one? Gregg:Okay, the sanctuary is [unintelligible] okay? Just hands off. Strawberry:You are bad. Gregg:Oh, am I? Oh, I hope you don't spank me. Strawberry:Well, I might. Gregg: Oh no! I may, I may, I may (both giggling). Gees, is my little tulip here gonna be the scarecrow or ... Juan:No, Gregg. I am not in it. Gregg:No, you have to do it. It'll be so cool. We'll have the entire Oz gang there because we already have a Dorothy and then my brother, Herman is playing the Tin Man. Strawberry:Right. Oh, I absolutely died when you told me. I hung up the phone and I literally fainted and just laid there for several hours. (sighs) It's a hard day. But I do have something for Herman that would be perfect. Let me see. I might need to make just a couple alterations. It's from my sequin line with a silver sequins live! (laughs loudly). Gregg:I love it. Strawberry:Yes? Gregg:But I think Herman's gonna say, "Less liberachi." Strawberry:Okay. Gregg:What do you think? Juan:I don't really like it. Gregg:Wow, didn't sugarcoat that at all. Strawberry:That's how you really feel. Bitch. Gregg:[inaudible] Herman:Miller, the eHarmony table is still going at it. Miller:They sure are. Man, they have been all over each other. Pete:Drop the check, little man. We are closed. So, how's your night? Miller:Yeah, pretty good. Pete:Yeah, did you make some money? Miller:I did. Pete:Really? Miller:Mm-hmm. Pete:Did they tip the bartender handsomely? Miller:We don't do that here. Pete:Really? Miller:Kind of a new policy. Pete:What kinda joint is this? Herman:They didn't even look at me. Miller:Well, give them a reason to look at you. Wait, wait, what are you doing? Oh my god, what are you doing? (laughs) Oh no! Herman:Hey! Right there! (laughs loudly) Yeah, plug it in! Leave a tip! Down the middle! Miller:Goodbye! Pete:Goodnight. Herman:Yes! Pete:Wow. Miller:Classy. One word to describe you. Classy. Gregg:Good evening. Can I get you something to drink? Can I get you something to drink? Good evening. Can I Juan, how's my delivery? Juan:It can use some work. Gregg:Wow, you just refuse to soften those blows. Juan:Look, Gregg. As the Lion, you are completely between you raising for power and that nagging insecurity that plagues your ability to lead. Gregg:Wow. I never thought about it like that. Good evening. Good eve Good eve- Good evening. Herman:You've got to be kidding me. Miller:[inaudible] (gasps) Oh my god! (laughs) You are the cutest thing I've ever seen. Herman:I'm gonna kill Gregg. I feel ridiculous. Miller:You'll get over it. Hey, is my lipstick too much? Herman:No. You look beautiful. Gregg:Are we off to see the wizard or what? Miller:Wow. Gregg:I know. Didn't these costumes just turn out great? Miller:Hey, Gregg. Aren't I supposed to have ruby slippers? Gregg:Well, in the book, they were silver and Strawberry really wanted to stay truthful to the source material. Miller:He couldn't find any, could he? Gregg:Nobody will see your feet. Herman:Juan, what are you wearing? Juan:I'm the Scarecrow. Hey, Mr. Herman, would you mind if I say a little prayer for us before we started? Herman:Sure. We need all the help we can get, right? Juan:Bow your heads. (translated) Our Father who are in Heaven ... (phone ringing) Pete:Yo! What's up, dude? Yeah, I'm still at work. Yeah, (chuckles). No, you're not gonna believe what's going on over here. Yeah, yeah, she's still here. Mm-hmm. No, I should probably go. I'll call you back. Okay, bye. Oh, sorry. Go. Juan:(translated) Humbly, we come before You and ask that You would care for us. May we make the best movie we can. And Jesus, please ... May Martin Scorsese give Mr. Herman, the part of the Tin Man. in the new Wizard of Oz movie. Amen. Herman:Amen. Miller:Amen. Juan:Now, everyone, take your places. (Miller giggles) Pete:Lights, camera, action. Gregg:So exciting. Oh! Miller:This is your time to shine, Herman. No more small parts. Herman:I'm an actor. Miller:You're an actor. Let's not use those faces. Juan:Okay, guys. I want this to have a new way kind of feel. Very conversational, very casual, okay? Pete:Save your breath, Francois. Juan:Okay guys, everyone ready? Herman:Mm-hmm. Pete:And we're rolling. Okay Juan, as the director, would you like to say, action? Juan:(chuckles) Sorry. Action! (light classical music) Gregg:Good evening. Can I get you something to drink? Miller:Water please. Herman:We'll have the bottle of the Dolcetto. Thank you. Gregg:Dolcetto? Why don't I just save the glasses and urinate directly into your mouth? Juan:Cut! Gregg! You got to say what is written in the script. Gregg:I know. I'm sorry. But Dolcetto is a terrible wine and I do not want my restaurant on film, serving Dolcetto. You should choose Barolo. Herman:Fine, I'll choose a Barolo. Let's just keep going. Come on. Miller:How's my blind face look? Herman:Solid. Pete:Scarecrow. Juan:Action! Gregg:Oh wait, you haven't ordered this yet. Ah, I'm a psychic! (laughs) Dionne Warwick! Oh wait, is she dead? I don't know. Pete:We're still rolling. Juan:Action. Pete:Shit show. Gregg:Good evening. Can I get you something to drink? Miller:Water please. Herman:I'll have a bottle of the Barolo. Thank you. Gregg:Barolo? What a fine choice you've made here at Vareli on 111th in Broadway in Manhattan. Juan:Gregg! Miller:Oh, Tin Man. I'm so thankful for you. Ever since that wicked witch cast that nasty spell on me, I felt so helpless. Herman:Dorothy, taking you out for a bottle of wine is the least I could do to help you forget about your temporary blindness. Gregg:Barolo. Just Oh! Miller:(gasps) I can hear it pouring! My other senses are so heightened now since I've been blind. Herman:(clears throat) Miller:Sounds like a lot. Herman:(clears throat) Juan:Cut! Gregg, could you please try pouring a little less wine, next time? Gregg:I know, I'm sorry. I got nervous and I did a bit of a heavy pour. I'll just pour some of it back into the bottle. Herman:No, it'll spill all over the table. Just pour it out and we'll get another one. Gregg:I will not. This is a very expensive vintage. Herman:Right, we have multiple takes. Gregg:Maybe we can use this. Pete:Okay, you know what? Miller:Holy crap! Pete:Nice. It's dry. Here we are. Problem solved. Moving on. Herman:Yeah, but don't we need a shot of Gregg pouring the wine? Pete:I'll fix it in post. And rolling. Juan:Action! Herman:I remember when you were just a girl from Kansas. Miller:Oh, you make me sound so plain. Herman:But you're a woman now. With needs. Miller:Tin Man. What are you getting at? We're best friends. Herman:The dreaded f-bomb. How could such a little word have such big impact? I got something for you to read. Miller:(gasps) Do you really mean that? Herman:With all my newly acquired heart. I can't stop thinking about you. Miller:You don't know what you're saying. Herman:I know life's tough for you, Dorothy. It's tough for me too. But with your height and my eyes, we make a damn good team. Miller:It's just Herman:If there's any hope that we might make this work, putting that friendship on the line is totally worth it. Miller:You took the easy way out by putting it on a card. Are you Tin Man enough to say it? Herman:I love you. Miller:(gasps) Herman:I can't reach. Miller:What? Herman:I can't reach. Juan:Cut! Pete:Wah, wah, wah. (laughs) Oh man, back to one. Juan:It's okay, Mr. Herman. We just do a close up for this shot. Go ahead and slide up a little closer to her. Good. Okay. Pete, soom in. Pete:Soom in? Juan:Yeah, soom in. Pete:Soom in. Juan:Yeah. You know, when you Pete:Zoom, zoom in? Juan:Exactly. Pete:Okay. Juan:Thank you, man. Pete:No, thank you. Herman:Are you ready for this? Miller:Yeah, of course. Are you okay? Herman:Yeah. I'm all right. Miller:Yeah, doing a great job. It feels real. Juan:Okay, Mr. Herman. When I say action, wait a few seconds and then slowly lean in. Pete:All right. Let's get this over with as soon as possible. Okay, we're rolling. Juan:And action! Juan:Cut! Pete:Hey, hey! Miller:Herman, stop! Pete:He said cut! The hell's wrong with you. Now, this whole thing is unbelievable. Miller:Pete, come on. Pete:No, why, why? I'm defending you. Why do you wanna be sexually harassed for some audition that's not gonna go anywhere? I mean have you looked at yourself in the mirror. Seriously, you really think that you would have a shot with Miller? Gregg:You shut up! Pete:What?! Gregg:Shut up! Pete:You talking (laughs) Yeah, you are talking to me, aren't you? Huh? Gregg:You need to leave. Pete:All right. You people all deserve each other. Have fun with your make-belief. All right, I'm done. I'm out! Especially with you! Gregg:You're fired! Pete:Oh, yeah? I quit. How's that? Freaks! Herman:Miller, I'm I'm so sorry. Miller:It's okay. It's okay. Herman:No, it's not okay. Miller:We were just acting. Herman:I wasn't. I wanted to kiss you. I just have to deal with the fact that no woman's never gonna love me. Miller:Herman, that is not true. You're great! You're funny and charming and a great listener and Herman:That's it, every time I walk you home, not once did you invite me in. For the first time, Pete walks you home and he spends the night. Miller:Who told you that? Herman:He did. Miller:Well, I shouldn't have let him in. Herman:Why did you? Miller:I don't know. Herman I care about you a lot. You know that, right? But I don't see you like that. Not that I couldn't maybe I don't know ever see you like that. Herman:Come on. At least be just honest with me. Juan:Mr. Herman, what about your audition tape? (sad music) (knocking on door) Gregg:Oh, Herman. Thank God, you didn't kill yourself. Herman:What are you doing here? Gregg:You forgot your ax. Herman:Gregg, leave. Gregg:I'm going to stay. Herman:Really, Gregg? Gregg:Am I interrupting something? (chuckles) All right. And now, you've got me as company. Cheers. Man, that was really hard to watch tonight. It was like a Shakespearean tragic- Herman:Please- Gregg:It's very difficult to stay on- Herman:Are you trying to send me to mom? Gregg:I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this. If you need time off from work, you've got it. Herman:I think her death has finally caught up with me. Gregg:Have I told you yet about my last conversation with mom? Herman:No. Gregg:Well, we were talking about which Golden Girl we were and she got really quiet. Which I thought was because I told her, I'm a Blanche. But I looked back over at her and she was signing your birthday card and she said, "I would give anything "if Herman haven't had to struggle through life." Herman:I wonder what it would be like to have some other abnormality you know, color blind or deaf in one ear or have weird birthmark. Something that people couldn't look at you and judge you right off the bat. See you and know why you're not normal. Gregg:You're right. It's not fair. It's not fair that you can't hide your uniqueness. and so in that spirit, I I have something to confess to you. Herman, I know this might be a little bit surprising but I'm a gay man. Oh my god, I can't believe I said it. I am sorry I've never told you and I'm sorry I had the ability to hide it. Herman:Sure you do. Gregg:You know, mom She was very supportive of us and she always supported my dream to own a restaurant. And now, she's supporting your dream to be an amazing actor. Herman:Gregg, don't try to make me cry. Give me a hug. Gregg:Good. Herman:Thank you for letting me use your restaurant. Gregg:Of course, we're brothers. Herman:Half-brothers. (lively music) (knocking on door) Gregg:I wonder who that could be. Right on cue. Miller:Hey, Tin Man. Herman:What? Juan:Mr. Herman, your dreams are not going down without a fight. Miller:After everything we shot last night, I'm sure we can get an audition tape together. Herman:Look, I think we should take a little break from my dream for a while. Miller:Herman. If you're gonna have one regret, please don't let it be that you never tried. Scorsese needs to see your tape today. Juan:Wait a second, we can still post your audition on JuTube. Gregg:YouTube. Miller:YouTube. Gregg:You Juan:You? Herman:You. Miller:You're saying JuTube. Juan:YouTube, I got it. Could you please start the camera? And Miss Miller, you know what to do. Herman:No, guys. In order to guarantee that Scorsese sees this, I gotta do it in person. I gotta break in to Rachael Ray's studio. Gregg:What are you, Nicholas Cage? You're acting all kinds of crazy right now. Herman:Crazy? Gregg, look at me. I'm Tin Man. I've only got one chance to make this happen. This is my opportunity to be a leading man! I've got to do this. This is what it takes to make it in this business! Miller:Well, what are we waiting for?! Gregg:(giggles) Grab your ax, Tin Man. Let's get on this yellow brick road. Miller:You think she signs autographs? Gregg:I don't know. She seems like a bitch. (fast paced music) Juan:Taxi! Taxi Driver:Let me guess, Emerald City? Herman:Close. Rachael Ray's studio. Taxi Driver:You got it. Gregg:Come on [camel] cab, drive us to war. Miller:Oh, sweet Jesus. (fast paced music) Is this a bad time for me to tell you guys, I get carsick? Gregg:Yes. It's a terrible time. Herman:It's the place right there. Miller:What if we get arrested? Gregg:Oh, god. Herman:I wouldn't do well in jail. Gregg:I feel like I would do well. Crew guy:Hi, Marty. 10 minutes until we need you but if you need me to grab you another Raging Red Bull or call a taxi driver to get you through the mean streets, I'm that kind of good fella. I'm also a writer and since you got some time on your hands, I'll just, my Hotmail is at the bottom of the page, so. Juan:So, guys, what's the plan? Miller:Okay, I'll go in first and do some recon. Wish me luck. Gregg:(laughs) It's so exciting. Miller:Okay Miller, you can do this. You can seduce him. You are one hot bitch. Oh Miller, don't call yourself a bitch. All right, let's do this. (light jazz music) Hi, there. Desk man. Jimmy:Oh, hello there lady. How can I help you? Miller:I was just wondering what floor does the Rachael Ray Show tape on? Jimmy:Oh, it's five. Miller:Ohh. Jimmy:But you're gonna need a special clearance on that. Miller:Oh. How's this for a special clearance? Jimmy:What, um ... Well, that is classified information, which you're trying to get your hands on. Miller:(chuckles) I know something you can get your hands on. (alarms sounding) Jimmy:Oh! I'm just gonna have to check that. Miller:Can't you just look back here for it? Just you know ... Jimmy:Do me a little favor and just stay here for a few moments and I'll just take care of this emergency. Miller:But I- (alarms sounding) Gregg:Go! Save yourselves! Ralph:Come on, you need a pass, let's go. Gregg:I surrender! (cries) Do with me what you want. Ralph:Just sign it. Just get up. Okay, come on. Everything is just all right. Gregg:Okay. I don't have ID. (alarms sounding) Guard:What the hell are you doing?! Hey, what are you doing?! (both shouting) Herman:(sighs) Okay. Jimmy:So, we got Dorothy, Scarecrow and the Lion. Boys, we got a Tin Man on the loose. (lively music) Herman:Where am I? Crew guy:Hi, Rach, five minutes and I think that Marty's gonna freak out when you put your meatballs in his mouth. (chuckles) (Herman screams) Guard:Get him! Crew guy:Marty, it's show time. Janitor:That one is wet. You can go around that. All right. Fair enough. Guard:There he is! Janitor:Shit, it's Tin Man! Crew guy:Right this way, Mr. Scorsese. (lively music) Herman:I wanna be your Tin Man. Ralph:Come in, Jimmy. Jimmy:Yeah, Ralph. Go ahead. I just talked to Marty. He said the little Tin Man was with him. So, he's clear? Jimmy:What do you want me to do with these guys? Ralph:I don't know. Release them I guess? Jimmy:Oh, Ralphy. You're no fun. Ralph:Uh, tell them to wait outside. Yeah, tell them to wait outside. Over. Jimmy:10-4. All right, my pretties. You can go. There's no place like home. Miller:Ugh, I can't believe I showed him the top of my cleave. Gregg:I've done worst for less. Miller:(sighs) Well? Herman:I didn't get the Tin Man. Gregg:That hack. What the hell does Martin Scorsese know about movie-making? Herman:Don't feel sorry for me. Gregg, I'm gonna need someone to cover my shift next week. Gregg:Of course, you need a vacation. You take it. Herman:I think I'm gonna get some sun in LA. Miller:Wait, what? Herman:Martin asked me to come audition for the Wizard. Miller:Herman! I'm so proud of you! (lively music) Juan:You really did it, my friend. Gregg:Oh, my brother is gonna be the wonderful Wizard of Oz! (laughs) (everyone laughing) (phone ringing) Herman:Hello? Tyrone:Herman, baby. If you are standing, you better sit down because I got the role of a lifetime for you. Tostitos is looking for a little person to be the new face of their everyday Cinco de Mayo campaign. They wanna put you on a deserted island. Dress you up in a sombrero, give you some maracas and let babes in bikinis eat pico de gallo off your little head. Need I say more? Herman:Sorry, Tyrone. I'm not interested. Tyrone:What, you got something better to do? Herman:Yeah, I do. (light guitar music) (Gregg humming) Gregg:* (lyrics) Oh, Herman Oh, oh, moment alone, Gonna be the Wizard Herman oh, oh Living your dreams * Something like that. (light guitar music) Miller:Hey, you! You wanna walk me home? Of all the excitement, I forgot to tell you about my big news. I have an audition tomorrow that I am going to. Herman:I'm glad to hear you didn't come to the city just to wait tables all your life. What's it for? Miller:Apparently, George Lucas is retaking Gone with the Wind. Herman:Wow, there is nothing sacred. Miller:(chuckles) I'm kidding. It's a taco commercial but I said on my resume, I could do a kick ass Spanish accent. Herman:I would kill to hear that. Miller:Herman, you could put your audition on the Jutube. (laughs) Herman:You shouldn't ever do that in front of Juan. (Miller laughs) Just a little unsolicited advice from your acting coach and your friend. Miller:Friend? Wow. You just dropped the f-bomb. What's going on with you? Herman:I'm leaving New York. Miller:I know. Herman:Permanently. Miller:What? Herman:Miller, I finally got a legitimate job to go to LA and regardless of what happens, I'm gonna stay. Miller:Okay. Well, when you make it big don't forget about us, little people. Well, goodnight. (chuckles) Herman:Goodnight. Miller:High five! (chuckles) Herman:Why do you wear those shoes? Miller:They elongate my legs. Herman:You're still lying to yourself. Miller:(cries) I'm gonna miss you so much. Herman:I'll miss you too. Miller:Herman! You wanna come inside and help me with my accent? Herman:Not tonight, I'm gonna keep walking. (easy listening alternative music) (easy listening alternative music)
