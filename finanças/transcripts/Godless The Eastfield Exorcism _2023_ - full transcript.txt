God hear me as I pray over this woman who has come to you as a sinner! (parishioner groaning) - Enter the golden chariot and canter across the clouds into the Kingdom of our God. (people yelling) - [Preacher] Who has let the spirits of your enemies come inside and influence us. With the power invested in me, by the Lord up above, free her from witches, and curses, (parishioner screaming) I free this woman. - Amen. (clock ticking) Doc? - Sorry Mr. Levonde, just a minute. - Call me Ron. If while you're writing that you want to do that referral we spoke about on the phone, we can just, I just, I wouldn't want to waste your time with all this medical stuff. - Given the nature of Lara's symptoms, I can appreciate the value of you being here, but I really need to hear it from Lara. What's been happening? - It's hard to say really. Things were subtle at the start. - It's been about three months, around the time of the anniversary. - [Doctor] Yours? - No, not that one. - That's in the past. - Nevertheless, we need to acknowledge trauma, and Lara has been through a lot. - Doc, with all due respect, you have no clue what my wife's been through. - Can you tell me a little bit more about what's been happening recently? - I'm not, I'm not sure. - At the um, at the start, we thought it was some weird sleepwalking thing. You know, I had a mate who used to do that when he had too much to drink. So I mean, was I worried? Sure, I'd seen it before. Then it got worse. - How did it get worse? - Dancing. (ominous music) (dark instrumental music) (dark instrumental music continues) (dark instrumental music) (dark instrumental music) Lara? Lara! - Dance with me, lover. - What are you doing out here? - I said dance with me! (Lara screaming) Get off me! Put me down! (screaming) (Lara screaming) Let me down. - She ignores me when I talk to her, but then I'll see her talking to herself, almost as if there's someone else there. Lots of staring off into space. It's like an emptiness and anger. - How do you experience these things? How are you feeling right now, Lara? - Are you aware when you're dreaming? I know what I'm experiencing and hearing isn't real, but at the same time I believe it is. (radio crackling) (radio static crackling) (radio static crackling) (radio stops) (radio static crackling) (radio stops) (radio static crackling) (water dripping) (water dripping) (man yelling) - All I ever wanted was a family, and a garden, a pretty one. Just something simple. Do you think it's something I can have one day? - Of course it is. That's why we're here. - Your goals here are perfectly valid. Just being here is the first step towards those goals. But it's going to take some time, and I can't promise you a miracle, but I can promise that I'm going to do my best to help you. I'd like to have you under observation. - Absolutely not. Not again. - [Lara] Ron. - I understand your reservations, but I really think that it's. - Yeah, look, I'm a diesel mechanic, not a doctor, but you medical people put her in that place. Only the Lord got her out alive. - I'm not questioning your faith, I'm just trying to facilitate what's best for the both of you. - And we, we appreciate that, don't we? You may not believe me when I say it Doc, but, I think you have Lara's best intentions at heart, but you've been deceived. - Deceived? - This is not a medical problem. - [Doctor] What do you believe it to be? - A spiritual one. (eerie music) (acoustic guitar music) ♪ I danced for the scribe and the pharisee ♪ ♪ But they would not dance and they wouldn't follow me ♪ ♪ I danced for the fishermen, for James and John ♪ ♪ They came with me and the dance went on ♪ (muffled singing) (eerie music) (muffled singing) - Ron? Ron? Ron. - Sorry Barb. - Come with me. (muffled singing) Good sermon today, yes? - Always. - Old one of Dayrl's. Sue me when I get to heaven. How are things at home? - All right. Lara's still not well. - I can remember when Daryl got sick, when the doctors started the chemo. Like good little sheep, we did exactly what they said. Let them put poison into his veins. They said as much. Anything to beat cancer. But he was dying, and I could feel my strength being sapped too. And then we made a friend, a friend outside of the congregation, an exceptional boy. He'd been dealing with his ma's illness for years. He knew what was going on. They were keeping us from going to church, making me sick and him sicker. And that's why we went back to church every single day. Even if I had to carry him. And we stopped taking those pills and listening to those doctors. - I feel for you both. - It was too late for Daryl. Those experts had done their damage. (solemn orchestral music) - I really miss him. He was a good pastor. Even better bloke. Terrible on a barbecue though. (both laughing) - We're family. I can't tell you what's wrong with Lara without seeing her. When you're ready, I'm here to help. And if I can't help, I know those that can, those that helped me. - Thank you Barb. (dark music) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) (thunder crashing) (demon screaming) (door opening) (door creaking) (pills rattling) - These are the pills the Doc gave you? - You mean Dr. Walsh? - Mm-hm. - Yeah. - You take 'em? - [Lara] No, not this morning. - [Ron] How do you feel? - Tired. - You can open your eyes, you know. (bed creaking) I was talking to Barb. She was saying that the pills her husband's doctor gave him, made him feel pretty crook too. - Well, sometimes you need to get worse before you get better. It's how they fight it. It's better getting sick from the pills than dying. - Think of it this way. You've been feeling more and more tired since you've been taking them, right? - Yeah, but she said - - And you just told me that you don't feel they're really doing anything. - I said not yet. - Not yet. How about this? Just for today. Don't take one. See if you feel better. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. - Maybe. - Maybe? I need more than maybe. (both laughing) - Sure, I'll think about it. (laughing) - What are you laughing at? - Nothing. - I'll have you know that this nose is a part of my European bloodline. - No, I'm just thinking about stuff, about how much of a dork you were when I met you, the way you'd look at me. - I'm still looking. - And? - Excuse me, I know exactly what you're up to, young lady. Come on, let's quit mucking around. (water dripping) - How long do you think it'll take to fix the harvester? - Couple of hours maybe. You going to be okay? - Yeah, I'll just try and be productive. Get some stuff around the house done. - You sure? I'll see you in a bit. Love you. - you too. (door closing) (Lara clearing throat) - [Plumber] Oh, hello? - Hi. - Yeah? - It's just, sorry can I get a glass of water, or will that mess everything up for you? I just need it to take my pills. - Oh no, no worries. I'll, I'll get out of your way. Nearly got it flowing nicely for you. - Would you like one? - A pill? - No, sorry, I meant a glass of water. - No, I don't normally drink water from other people's taps. - Really? Why is that? The water I mean, aren't you a plumber? - That's exactly why. I know what's in it. It's fluoride. Mate, it is awful stuff, really. I mean I got some um, big filters back at home, which take out anything that's not good old H2O, because ordinary tap water mate, that'll fuck you up. It's poison. - Poison? - Oh yeah. But worse. Well poison, it just uh, it just kills you. But the micro metals, they turn your brain into a receiver, so, so so that they can send remote signals to your brain. Ah, you should educate yourself. Me, I didn't even get vaccinated. These veins, clean as a whistle. So what about you? Did you get your kid vaccinated? - My kid? Did someone tell you I have a child? - You did. Looks like they're here. - What the hell are you talking about? - Yeah. Yeah, we're all just in the process of moving in. Yeah well, its been pretty stressful to tell you the truth, but um, but this place, it's, it's the perfect size. (sinister music) Flowing. - I think you should leave. - Did you hear that? (sinister music) - Hear what? - That. (baby crying) Isn't that your baby? - My my baby. (heart beating) (eerie music) (floor creaking) (baby crying) (sinister music) (sinister music continues) (door creaking) (baby crying) (heart beating) (baby fussing) (heart beating) (eerie music) (heart beating) (dark music) (demon screaming) - Look at me, Lara. (Lara crying) What's, what's wrong baby? Look at me, Lara. (Lara crying) Hey baby, angel, angel. Angel, hey, look at me, look at me. (Lara crying) Shh. Shh. Shh. (dark music) This is not your fault. None of this is your fault. we're going to get through this, okay? Okay? Whatever it takes. (muffled speaking) Doc, there are forces a play here that you and I aren't prepared for, things beyond human understanding. - I want to be very clear, Lara's condition is medical, a mixture of hypermania and paranoid schizophrenia. If she continues with her medication, then her brain chemistry will eventually correct itself. - This is not her brain doing it, it's not even her. - Please. Take a seat. - I'll stand, thank you. Sorry. - [Doctor] I understand that you might feel like the system failed you, but that was a long time ago. - Well, Ron thinks it's just we've, we've tried this, we went down that path. - But treatments have improved. - We're on the same page. - I mean the pills are making me feel a little better. - Come on. You see what you're doing? You've confused her. Talk to me. What's going on? - I'm scared. - It's okay, baby. This is what these doctors do. They want to scare you to sell more pills. Doc, can you just give us the referral? We'll get out of here. - I can refer Lara to another doctor if she's not happy with her treatment here. But they'll likely tell you the same thing. - We've talked about this before, Father Argento, but he won't see her until we can prove we've exhausted all our options. We've exhausted them. Please. - Lara? - I'm sorry. Ron thinks this will help. I can't go back to the ward. I trust him. - I strongly recommend that we continue with our appointments. We can create a new treatment plan for you. - Stop. Doc, the only reason we are here is because the priest won't even look at her without a psych signing off. Please, just let us get the help she really needs. - [Doctor] And what is that? - Formal sanctioned deliverance. An exorcism. - Ceremonies and rituals conducted as exorcisms are extremely detrimental to her personal- - You see? There she goes again. You know, I find that a little insulting. Father Argento is an exorcist trained by the Vatican. They do this all the time. - Moving away from medical practice, in my opinion would be unwise. - Are you going to tick the box or not? - It's really not that simple. - Then thank you for your time. Let's go sweetie. (sinister music) Angel? Suit yourself. (door closing) - You should talk about what you really want. Talk about Ron. - He's just trying to help. - Yeah, I understand that, and his frustration, but I'm concerned about the level of that frustration. - No, he would never put me in danger. - This is my private number. If anything happens that makes you feel unsafe, call me. This is a small town and you need to be able to speak to someone that isn't everybody else. Please. Take my card. - Thanks doctor. - [Marisa] Marisa. - Marisa, thank you. (sinister music) (door closing) (sinister music building) God give me strength. (tense music) (banging) You going to let me in? Please? I'm sorry. I got, I got overwhelmed. Please let me in. Can you open the back door? I need to lie down. (door opening) I know that's not what you wanted. - What are we going to do now? - I was feeling a little better. - But you don't tell her that, do you? We agreed. You go in there, we say what we've got to say, get your referral and tick the box. - I was being honest. I was feeling okay until I stopped taking the pills. - Angel, I love you, but you are far from okay, haven't been for weeks. It's me that's got to deal with it. - What? What did you fucking say? - Are you having an episode now? - Are you joking? (engine revving) (tense music) (engine running) - You just don't get it, do you? - Ron, stop. - This isn't just going to go away. - You don't think I know that? I'm the one who's been living with it. - You're not acting like it. - How am I meant to act? I'm exhausted. I'm tired of the stares, the comments. Everyone talks down to me, including you. - I do not talk down to you. - You just did. Like I'm the first person in the world to be sick, like, like I can't be fixed. - This is spiritual warfare, Lara. What don't you get? You need serious spiritual realignment. You're too far from Christ. Everyone at church knows it. You know they talk about you. Where's Lara? Where is she? And when you are there, you're like a fish out of water. - Well it's nice to know I'm nothing more than an embarrassment to you and all your churchy little friends. - Our friends. - If you wanted to marry a nun then you shouldn't have married me. I want to live life, I'm not going to church. - Don't be like that. All right, tell me this. How do you think doing nothing's going to help? - I'm not doing nothing. You're like one of those brainwashed missionaries. Wouldn't give soup to the starving unless they pray your way. Everything has to be your way, doesn't it? - I've never said that. - Then shut up about it or I'm getting out. - No, I'll shut up when you get into your head that taking pills and pruning roses isn't going to fix anything. - Let me out. - For the love of everything that is good and holy, stop being such a lunatic and a complete bitch. (Lara gasping) (Lara gasping) - I'm sorry. (Lara gasping) I miss being a team, you know? (Lara gasping) Lara? - [Lara] There's nothing wrong with me Ronald. - Do you want me to pull over? - Pull over?, drive us into a fucking tree! Do it cunt, do it! - Just breathe, okay, calm down. - Shut up dickhead - Lara? It's me, calm down. (Lara gasping) (tense music) - We entered her body A body the perfect size. For us to feast and fade into. Us flowing into her. Her flowing into us, feeding us. (Lara gasping) She didn't even fight it - Stop, just stop! - Stop, I am legion. I am fire and war, I will skull fuck you in hell farmboy! (Ron yelling) (Ron panting) - You almost killed us. Whatever you call yourself, give me back my wife! - God made your kind for us to feast on. This is your divine purpose. Why do you think He never answers your prayers? - You want to bet? Never's a long time. - No difference. Us are one. All of us together. I into you, you into I, one. A body flowing together legion. - Shut up, shut up, shut up! By the power of God. - Fuck your God, we are legion, you are nothing. (Lara whimpering) I don't want to play - I'll take you home. - I don't want to play, I don't want to play, I don't want to play. (screaming) Please just stop, just stop. Please stop. (dark music) She's getting worse. - We'll take the congregation to her, a home visit. - This is private. I don't want the whole town knowing she's sick. What will the church say? - They'll say that in your hour of need you turn to God. (tense music) - I need your help, Barb. - Anything. But you need to tell me what's wrong. - That bloke who helped you? - Daniel. - Daniel. What does he know about demonic possession? (sinister music) (yelling) I am Hitler - Satan, Beezelebub. I am Morlock Mother Mary's bleeding cunt. I am Legion. (yelling) - Do not look away from the face of God. (possessed yelling) So, what is it? - Another call came through. - They said he's coming. - Praise be. Daniel answers to the Almighty and the Almighty alone. Not to the Vatican. He doesn't need a referral from a doctor. Bare your soul to him, just like I did. He will help. (sinister music) (sinister music continues) (sinister music continues) (sinister music continues) (door closing) (knocking on door) - Barbara. Ron. Daniel James King, Danny and Dan are fine. - Barb tells me they refer to you as the instrument of God. - A silly nickname. But if I was, I'd be a tuba. Good, you've put the plastic up. I see you followed my instructions. - Yes. Will that keep the demons out? - An old trick. Where is the afflicted? - She's in our room. - Unrestrained? Hang on, you haven't locked it up at all? - I told him but he wouldn't listen. - These things are patient, unpredictable beings. Dangerous at the best of times. The demon poses a threat to the vessel, your wife. But also to all of us. I don't want to see anyone being thrown out a window or having their throat ripped out. So from now on, I think it's best for all of us, if we had it restrained. - Why do you refer to my wife as it? - Well your wife is possessed, correct? Well then while she's possessed, we must separate the body from the person. Confusing the two is just part of its trickery. Have you been feeding it? - She hasn't been eating. - Oh, it's probably best that way. From now on, no feeding it, no bathing it. Lara's body is just a vessel for the demonic now, and it must be kept weak. Hey, I am here on behalf of Jesus Christ himself. I come to you as nothing more than just to follower of his commands. You must obey any and all instruction that I give you without question, without hesitation. I know my methods may seem excessive, but you must have faith, Ron. Do you have it? - Of course. - Hallelujah. Now, I'm going to prepare my divine tools. Just know that the demon will do and say anything to toy with you and be let loose. But God's strength rests within you, Ron. You know, a test like this only brings you closer to God, bonding you with the Holy Spirit. What a reward that is. What a reward. (door opening) (door creaking) (chair thumping) - Hey angel. He's here. We're still on the same page with this, right? Whatever it takes. - What are you going to do to me? - Nothing, nothing. We need to keep you safe. It's only for a little while. - Am I dangerous? - No. None of this is your fault, understand? - Look at me, look at me. I will keep you safe. I promise. (dark music) - I trust you. - God is with you, Jesus is with you. All the angels and saints in heaven are with you. No one is an instrument of God's justice like you. This is what you were born for, what you were made for. (slapping) (dark music) (Lara gasping) - Lara, wait. Lara! (Lara screaming) (high-tension music) - Let me go! - Don't show it weakness Ron. (Lara struggling) Let me go - What are you doing? - Enough. - No! No no no no please. You don't have to do this. Where's Ron? No! (Lara screaming) (door slamming) (dark music) (sinister music) (eerie music) - Ron! Ron! (ominous music) Ron! (Lara struggling) - Name? Name? Name? - Lara. (dark music) - Chair. Chair. I'm speaking now to the primary demon residing in this vessel. I command you, give me your name. - Please, please. Let me go. - Oh, come on, let's not play games. Show yourself. - Please, just take me back inside. Where's Ron? Ron? Ron! - Barbara, I have a leather bag and jug of water, could you bring it to me? - Yes. - Thank you. (Lara crying) - Ron! (door closing) - Name? Lara. Name! - Lara, my name is Lara. - I don't care how many of you there are in there. I'll break you all, one by one. You will bend to God's will. My will, before me. Before God. You are weak. You are nothing. You are nothing! Thank you Barbara, just set them down over there. - Barbara. Barbara, please please please. - [Daniel] Persecuted by the church, not selected. - Please. - [Daniel] Lift them to the most high. (Lara crying) - For haughty men have risen up against me, and fierce men seek my life. Turn the evil back upon my foes and destroy them. God, who wants all men to be saved. (ominous music) (Lara crying) God, commands you - I can take my pills, come to church. - Church? It's a bit late for that. It's not men in white coats or pills and potions that you need -- it's prayer (high-tension music) (Lara grunts) (Lara gasping) Fuck you, dog! (screaming) - There you are, demon. One by one you will all show yourselves to me. And I will have no fear for I am a soldier of God. I do not relent, I do not tire. I do not yield. - Pig fucker. You think some drunken pisspot with a Ouija board intimidates me? Cockroach! You are nothing, nothing! (Lara gagging) (dark music) Are you going to sing to me? - I didn't come here to sing Kumbaya and clap for you darling. I came here to exorcize the devil. (tense music) (Lara laughing) (Lara laughing) (Lara screaming) (Lara laughing) - We need reinforcements, people who comprehend the gravity of the situation, who understand the power of prayer, who have been baptized in the Holy Spirit. Lara's not just possessed, she's infested. There's one that sounds like a child, one that sounds like a tradie, and legion. I assume these have all manifested themselves to you. Is that correct? All three? - All three. - We've got my congregation to pull from, and a very supportive community in general. - The only way to eradicate an infestation of such scale. - I dunno about that. - Ron, I'm the only man capable and willing to save your wife, and I'm telling you that we need more of our own. - [Barbara] Remember Galatians 6:2, it's okay to ask for help. - Make the call. (mysterious music) (bus running) (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (soft piano music) (drawer opening) (tense music) It's your time to shine. (soft music) (ominous music) (door closing) (group chatting) Demonic attachments have been placed all throughout this house. Pathetic attempt to cling to this child of God, to linger, but they will not persist. What do you have to say about that, demon? Huh? - What are you doing here, Danny boy? Out in the sticks. Where churches send their boy-fuckers. - Silence demon, father of lies. God, you are the merciful one, forgiving. Accept our servitude, Almighty. Accept our prayer that this servant of yours, this lamb, may she be restored. And with your power and the power of the Holy Ghost expel these evil spirits. - [All] Amen! - Help me, brothers and sisters, help me sing this poor soul back to health. - [All] Amen! (Lara gasping) - Do you feel Christ's power? The power and the glory of heaven are within me. Can you feel it? - [All] Amen! - You can feel it too, can't you serpent? You can feel that power. The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Be gone demons, be gone. (people shouting) Serpent be gone. (people shouting) Hell is your only shelter, that is your only home now. (Lara whimpering) - She said, stop. Can't you see she's done!? - Ron, she's not done until I say she's done. - What are you talking about? - Settle Ron, settle. That's not your wife. - [Lara] Please? Please, you don't have do this. - Don't be a pawn in the demon's game. - Maybe we should take a break. - This is just a feeble attempt at deception. We wont fall for it. This right here, this is the war against Satan. You are living it. So put your war face on and fall in line. - [Lara] Ple... Please. Water. - Water... (dark music) - Water... - Please....water. I need water. Let me go! (crying) - Do you want us to stop now? We can all go home. Your wife will waste away. She'll be dragged to hell. - Shut up. - [Daniel] Do you want that, Ron? - Shut up! - [Daniel] Do you want your wife to burn for all eternity? - Please, won't anyone help me? - But darling, we are. - I know it's hard. I know it's hard, brother. This is the hardest thing a man can go through. But, the power of God, the power of the Holy Spirit is within you. Think of Noah. Everyone. I want you to all think about Noah. He and his family were on that fabled ark for 150 days. 150 days, with nothing but ocean, ocean where land used to be. Tell me now that you wouldn't falter once. Tell me now that your faith wouldn't be tested. No. This man, this man right here. This man is strong. - [All] Amen! - Amen. You see, Ron, it's going to be okay. We will save your wife. - You don't need do this. You said he was just going to pray over me, you promised. You promised. You promised. (soft music) - Perhaps now is a good time to take a break. Let us help our brother out by breaking bread together. We'll get some supper in us and get back here in about an hour. How does that sound? - [All] Amen. - I'm sorry. (pensive music) - Please, please. Please help. Please, please, please, I'm not sick. I mean I'm only sick. - Have faith child. I love you, but I know what you are. - Let me go! (screaming) (Lara gasping) (Lara crying) Please. My jacket, Dr Walsh, please. - [Daniel] Is everything okay in there? - She was just making noise. - Please, Dr. Walsh, please. (door closing) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - Did you see the Pope just pardoned Galileo? - That's not like them to be consistent. You know, I don't think the Holy Spirit's moved in the Vatican the way that I felt it move here, in this house with all of you. You all felt the fire? What about you, Ron? You felt the fire these past few days? - I'm, I am struggling to celebrate. - Celebrate? We're not celebrating. Ron, we are congregating. By being closer together, we're making it harder for the demons to break us down. We are here because we love you. We've done a lot of great work these past few days, that's for sure, but Ron is right. We've won some battles, but we haven't won the war. I do remember the first time. (door opening) - Lara's missing. - Missing? (eerie music) Everyone grab a torch and partner up. It can't be far. (dark music) (eerie music) - [Speaker] Lara! - Lara! - Lara. (high-tension music) Fan out. She can't have gone far. (high-tension music) Lara. - [Ron] Lara. Baby? Lara! Lara. - Lara. (Lara panting) (dark music) - [Barbara] Lara. - [Ron] Angel. - [Speaker] Lara. (ominous music) (eerie music) (eerie music) (eerie music) - [Speaker] Lara! (tense music) Lara! (baby fussing) (tense music) (tense music) (fire crackling) (high-tension music) (demon growling) (tense music) (demon growling) (sad orchestral music) (baby fussing) (music fading) (sad string music) (birds chirping) - I need to speak to Peter. - Yeah, you just need to sign in. You know how it is. Peter's around here somewhere. - Marisa? - I'm trying to do a welfare check on one of my clients. She's not picking up the phone. - Kim, could you start taking some details? - She's schizophrenic and I'm extremely concerned for her wellbeing. - Okay, come on through. - [Daniel] How are you feeling? - Exhausted. Can't imagine what now. - Well, the righteous path is not for the fainthearted, but God's magnificent creation makes it all worth it. We worked tirelessly throughout the night last night, for which I expect no thanks at all, but what I don't expect, nor can I accept is your interference. We expelled many lesser demons last night. We are on the edge of deliverance, Ron, right on the edge. But these last three will require the most out of us, out of me. - I just hate seeing her suffer. Can I ask you a question? - Of course. - Why Lara? - I looked into your lives. You know what I found? Nothing. Nothing that would suggest that your or your wife were doing anything to allow the demonic into her life on such a scale. And then I did find this. And yet no child to speak of, which simply leads me to wonder why? What happened? You don't know? - She doesn't like to speak about it. - Barbara also told me that your wife spent some time in an institution. - Yes. - Ron, what do you really know about your wife before she met you? Whoever she is now, we have no idea who she was before. - She said she felt responsible for the baby's death. Elliot, his name was Elliot. Can we save her? (eerie music) (muffled singing) ♪ Glory glory hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory glory hallelujah ♪ ♪ His truth is marching on ♪ - I hold in my hand this, the final attachment. You last three demons will be expelled, and Lara will be returned to her body. You hear me, serpent? I said, do you hear me? - Oh no, no! - You see this? This is fear. The Almighty has terrified them. Brothers and sisters in God. Present arms, show our enemy your faith. - Lord. - God, God, I'm calling upon you to grant me constant faith as I perform this deliverance. See to it that everyone here in this room be impervious to satanic trickery and black magic, and grant me the strength that I, with your strength, can expel this evil spirits. - [All] Amen. - Take this. Take it. You know what must be done? - No. - Look upon this. - No. - Look at it. - Fuck you. - Look at it. - Please, please. - Advance. Christ compels you to leave this person, now. - [All] Now, now, now. - I bring down upon you the power of heaven, the power of Christ. Ron. - No no no. - In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. (Ron yelling) (Lara screaming and crying) - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry - Tremble before God. Bow down before the Almighty. Beg for his mercy. Beg for his kindness. (slugging) You will get neither. Pray with me. Soul of Christ. - [All] Soul of Christ. - [Daniel] Sanctify me. - [All] Sanctify me. - [Daniel] Body of Christ. - [All] Body of Christ. - [Daniel] Save me. - [All] Save me. - [Daniel] Blood of Christ. - [All] Blood of Christ. - Inebriate me! - [All] Inebriate me. - Get her on the floor. - No no no no. (Lara crying) No! No, no! (Lara screaming) (thunder rumbling) Please, please. (crying) - I command you to leave this vessel. (Lara screaming) I compel you to leave this vessel. I compel you, leave this vessel! (Lara screaming) God has spoken to me. He said to me, He said, I am giving you the power to tread on serpents, to tread on scorpions. He told me that nothing by any demonic means would ever hurt me. (demon growling) That's right everyone, touch this woman, pray over her. Pray upon her. Pray for her. Legion is clinging to life inside her. With all our might, we must push this final demon out. - [All] Push. - [Voice On Radio] Flowing, flowing. Flowing clean water like never before. You'll not only save money, but also filter out dangerous minerals and micro metals in your water that can- - We should get one of those. - A water filter. - Sure. The less garbage we put in our bodies, the better, right? Plus, it's got to be better for Elliot. - What garbage? - I don't know, minerals and shit. Micro chips. - Okay, yeah we'll, we'll pick one up tomorrow and we'll get some tin foil to block out the secret government signals too, yeah? - Right. - I'm changing it. (radio crackling) - [Voice On Radio] (indistinct) the boy Legion and the other demons are upon us. - This radio's broken. (baby fussing) - What, why? What's going on, mate? (baby fussing) - Did you not just hear that? - No. - Really? (crashing) (soft piano music) (fire burning) - [Rescuer] Take her first come on. Easy. Take it easy. - [Rescuer 2] Somebody help that guy. - David! (driver screaming) - Elliot. Let me go! Elliot! (driver screaming) (explosion) No! (Lara screaming) (solemn orchestral music) - [Daniel] Lay her back down. We will deliver this woman now, we will exorcize the devil. Be humbled, enemy of God. Enemy of the church, enemy of all that is good, fear him He unites us, all of us. Push dam you, push We have to squeeze the demons out of her. - [Speaker] Amen. - [Legion] Legion, however many of you there are in there, I compel you to leave. - [All] Out, Out, Out, Out, Out. - Get out, out of this house, out of this woman, I said, be gone. (bone cracking) Restrain it (Lara moaning) (Lara gasping) - [Lara] Let me go! - [Daniel] Amen. - [All] Amen. - [Daniel] Hallelujah. - [All] Hallelujah. - [Daniel] Amen! - [All] Amen! - I command you, ancient serpent, in the name of the law, his law He is the judge of the of the living and the dead, creator of the universe. He who has the power, to part. (all yelling) Give way Legion. Give way. Give way to the Lord. I beg of you. I know you want to leave. Get out, get out of this woman. She repels you. Jesus compels you, compels you. (Lara screaming) (ripping) (Daniel panting) It is done. (Daniel panting) (Ron crying) - Angel. Angel. Angel. Angel. (Daniel panting) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (pensive string music) (mournful string music) (brighter orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) (Ron sobbing) - Ron, is she breathing? - No! Help! Will somebody please help? Somebody please help me! (mournful orchestral music) - Angel. (Olivia sobbing) (sad orchestral music) - Sweet baby Jesus spoke through me. Fear not. He said, she will rise. - [Speaker] What? - Resurrection my good man. A miracle will happen here today. - You killed her, she's dead. You killed her. - No, she will rise. - I'm calling an ambulance. - You doubt the word of God? Are you questioning God? Are you questioning me? Then there's no need for an ambulance. - She's dead. - Well of course she's fucking dead. That is the prerequisite for resurrection. Olivia. Just get out. I said, get out you blasphemous whore. Get the hell out. How dare you question God? How dare you question me? (growling) Oh God. Oh God. Forgive me. (Daniel breathing heavily, muttering) Any other naysayers in this room? that want to question the word of the Lord, huh? You? Huh? You? Then just shut up. Just shut the hell up, all of you. Let me do my fucking job. Hey. My child. We have a miracle to prepare for. Make no mistake. God has chosen us, us of all people. The most spectacular of miracles. The most magnificent of events. The body is dead, yes. But her soul lives on, Ron's wife is alive. Her spirit stands beside God. And in three days, on the day of her funeral, she will be returned to her body. God is trusting us to deliver this poor soul from evil. She will be returned to us, yes. She will. Spread the word far and wide. Invite them, they will come. They will come and she will follow. She will rise. She will rise. (eerie music) - As a man of faith, what do you make of this? - You'd have to say, I was lapsed, but I am a Christian. I'm not crazy. - Someone should have been here sooner. - The decision was always out of my hands. This is not something we prepare for. This, this isn't normal. What could we have done? (somber orchestral music) - Detective Chambers. - Hey, Skinny. So today's the day. You're finally going to let us go in? End this madness? Or do I get a chance to exercise the warrant you people made it so hard for me to get. - Well come on in. Just take it slow up the driveway. There's a lot more people come since you were here last. A lot of new faces. (eerie music) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music continues) (dramatic orchestral music continues) (dramatic orchestral music continues) (dramatic orchestral music continues) (soft piano music) (people shouting in the distance) - So today's the big day, eh? - Indeed it is, Detective Chambers, the hour is upon us and God smiles down at us. You must be the famous Dr. Walsh I've heard so much about. - You people kicked up a big stink about religious freedom, so much so that I couldn't do my job. Well now your time is up. When are you going to throw in the towel? - You're more than welcome to witness with us today. I'm sure Lara would love to talk to you herself. - I'd like to speak with Ron. - I'm afraid that's going to be impossible. As you can see, he's busy saving his wife. To disturb him now would jeopardize all of our hard work. Now it is my understanding, Detective, after speaking to your superior, that we have until the end of day to surrender - yeah? - It would be unwise to continue to harass us. - I'm here as an impartial observer, hand to God. - I'm here when you're ready to talk. (soft piano music) - You might as well be talking to a brick wall, Doc. (soft piano music) (door closing) (mournful orchestral music) (mournful orchestral music continues) (mournful orchestral music continues) (mournful orchestral music continues) (mournful orchestral music continues) (mournful orchestral music) (mournful orchestral music continues) Gentlemen, I can honestly say, hand on heart, that a little piece of me really hoped that this might work. Lara sure didn't deserve what happened to her. You ready to call it a day, now? Listen, I'm not here to pass judgment on your faith or your beliefs. I have beliefs. All of us down at the station have beliefs, but your actions are not judged by their sincerity. - I answer to a higher authority. - Mr. King, would you please escort me to my vehicle? Come on Danny, you don't want to be dragged out anymore than I want to drag you. - I surrender. - I'm going to stay here with him. - You have five minutes. - You doctors, you think that you can cure everything with your pills and you're talking. When she was bubbling over with demons, you couldn't save her, only I could save her. I saved her, I saved her. Her body might be gone, yeah, but her soul is freed, thanks to me. You couldn't save her doctor. So I had to. - Try not to save anyone else on your way out. (door closing) - What are you doing here? - I came for Lara. - Why didn't you do your job? We needed that referral. - I did everything that I could. - Oh, you were so willing to tell me what was right. You never stopped to listen to what I had to say. - I'm sorry for your loss. - There is no loss. The only reason Lara didn't come back is because it's better to be with God, than be with us.
