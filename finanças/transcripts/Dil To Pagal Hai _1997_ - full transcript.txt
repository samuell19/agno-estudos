What is love? Love? Love is life. Love? What is love? Why and where? I believe that God predetermined all our emotional relationships. But He left it to us to find each other. He made us all couples.. ...and each one has a soul mate. A soul mate? What nonsense! I don't believe in all this.. I'm absolutely sure. Somewhere, someone has been made for me.. ...and that someday, I shall certainly meet him. Okay, but will someone please tell me.. ...how would I know who was made for me? I mean, will she be holding a placard with my name on it? When I see her, will there be a clap of thunder.. ...or a flash of lightning? What? How would I recognise her? I don't know what others would do, but I'll certainly know it's him. He will tell me.. He will give me a sign, and my heart would know its him. What is all this? - This is love. Love? "However far apart they may be.." "Their paths will meet, come what may." "When two people are made for each other.” "Made for each other." "Like the heart and heartbeats.. - Made for each other." "Like the eye and the mirror.. - Made for each other." "Like the monsoon and the rains.. - Made for each other.” "There's a man for every woman.. - Made for each other." "Made for each other" "Made for each other" "When God made a heart.." "..He split it in two." "He gave them two names.." "..Radha and Krishna" "Now the two hearts beat." "They part and they unite." "For they are made for each other.” "Made for each other." "Made for each other." "Made for each other." "Made for each other." "1 didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "1 didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." " .stole my heart away." "Stole my heart away." "1 didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." " .stole my heart away." "Stole my heart away." "Stole my heart away" "In the hide-n-seek of my first love..” "In the hide-n-seek of my first love..” “..1 took refuge in the shelter of his eyes without a thought.” "Now I'm frightened.." "..because furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." " .stole my heart away" "Stole my heart away" "Stole my heart away" "My hair dishevelled, my gait uncertain as if ll were drunk.” "My hair dishevelled, my gait uncertain as if ll were drunk.” "Were I seen, it would raise a million questions." "Oh, how do I go home?" "..for furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." " .stole my heart away" "Stole my heart away" "Stole my heart away" "1 didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." " .stole my heart away." Jimmy, is Rahul at the entry point? - No, Rahul's not here. What do you mean not there? He's supposed to enter in two minutes. Find him, fast! Oh, God. I'll be right back. "Stole my heart away" Shruti, did you find Rahul? - No. "Stole my heart away." "Stole my heart away." "1 didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "1 didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "The first glance of love.." " .stole my heart away." " .stole my heart away." " .stole my heart away." " .stole my heart away." " .stole my heart away." Yes, very good. Keep it up, everyone. - Rahul.. Rahul! I've told you numerous times that.. ...you should be at the wing five minutes before your entry. When you're not there, I start fretting that you'll be late.. I got this idea at the last minute And I thought that if I shoot out on to the stage.. ...the audience will freak out, and that's what happened. And anyway, there was no goof up. What's the fuss all about? Look Rahul, I'm fed up with your last minute entries. Hey Nisha, I'm the director. I can change whatever and whenever I want, including you. Forget it. You'll never find another dancer like me. I can get Shruti to dance better than you. - Shut up! Nisha! Fight with him later. It's time to go on stage. Take the mike. - Go and tell Suppandi. - I'll tell. What? - What? Okay everybody, let's get the lights. Idiot. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'd like to thank you all on behalf of the entire team.. ...for making this dance show a huge success. Thank you so much. As you all know, this is the last night of this show. However, I promise you that we'll be back here in three months.. ...with a new story, new songs.. ...and a new name. Maya. Maya? - Yes, 'Maya" is the name of our new dance show. Thank you very much everybody, and good night to you. Cheers! Wonderful. - We had good fun at the show. Hey, hang on a minute. Rahul, this new play 'Maya'.. What's it all about? Tell us. Tell us Rahul. Please. - Get up. Tell us about it. - Okay, okay. Maya. Maya. I don't know. - What? - I don't know. - What is this? If you didn't know that, then why did you tell everyone.. ...that we're doing a new play called 'Maya'.. ...and that we'll do it in three months? Now look, even ll don't know who or what Maya is.. ...but I do know that in three months we'll do a play called 'Maya'. Do you have in mind a girl who's like Maya? She's still in my imagination, not in my mind. Nisha! I've got a girl in mind. Rahul! aren't you talking about Pammi, the Colonel's daughter? Am ll right? Isn't it Pammi? Rahul, is Maya the kind of girl you can fall in love with? I don't fall in love with girls. Girls fall in love with me. - There he goes again. But Maya is the kind of girl that anyone could love. Maya is the kind of girl for whom you would leave your Soni. You dare not cheat on my sister. - Bally, relax. Quite. What does she do? She comes in dreams. Is Maya beautiful? Very. This Maya must be doing something. She must be working, singing, dancing.. Maya dances, but not like you. - What? - She dances only for herself. Excuse me, but she is a feeling, A fantasy, she's beautiful.. ...and she dances, and we've got to find her in three months. So who is she? Maya is all these things, and yet she is only Maya. Oh, Rahul. There you go again on the same topic. I'm hungry. I'll get something to eat. Okay? Hey, leave him alone. - You all carry on. I'm coming. Maya. I've spent my life managing chores. I'll make a decision today. Good morning, aunty! - Silly girl! Where were you? I've been looking for you all over. - I was outside. Now you must to come with me. Where? - I'm tired of you uncle's daily nonsense. So, today there will be a fight, and you must take my side. Okay. Let's go. "Sometimes, a thought.." "..crosses my mind.." Bravo, bravo! "As if you all have been called only for me." Wow. - "You've been scrubbing dishes so long.." "You've been made to sit in the audience for my sake." Bravo, bravo. What a performance! Sir. Excuse me, Sir. Go on, Chandni..l mean, Shanti. If you permit, could we have a tea break? Break whatever you want. If you don't mind, may I have a word with your students? Of course. Watchman, gardener.. - Yes, ma'am. Shankar and Ramu. - Yes. If you don't mind, will you all get back to work now? Where are you going? - Thank you. Why are you driving away my audience? - Quiet. You gather all the servants here and stall all the work. I have to do all the chores myself. Today onwards, no more music recitals. Henceforth, only you will listen to your music. No audience. My music isn't appreciated in my own house. How would anybody else appreciate it? Thanks to your aunt's attitude, I could never become a great singer. I know, I know. Now forget it and have a cup of tea. No, I don't want any tea. - Oh come on, Uncle. Have a cup of tea, and sing a song for me. Will you listen to my song? - Of course. Really? - Certainly. So let me have the tea. Pooja. There's a parcel for you. It's from Ajay! Should be his cassette. I'll hear it right away. - Hear my song first. Later, Uncle. please! See that? You always drive my audience away What are you dreaming of? I was thinking how fast time flies. It seems like yesterday that Mr. Khanna and Geeta had that accident.. ...and the ten-year old Pooja came home. And now, it seems as if we never had a life without her. And I have never seen such close friends as Pooja and Ajay. 'Hey, fatty! How are you?' Shut up, I'm not fat. 'I've heard that these days you've really put on some weight.' 'Don't do that or no one will marry you!' Idiot. Don't worry about my marriage. Who's going to marry you? "By now, you must have finished cursing me. So I'll proceed.” 'I'm having fun, as usual, and work and girls are keeping me busy.' 'Tell you what? I never realised how handsome I am when I was in India.' 'Don't make faces. If you wish, ll can fax you.. ...a list of my girlfriends. No, thank you. 'For your information.. I've broken up with Tina..' '..because she doesn't like Hindi films.' Thank God. She was so stupid. 'And now I've fallen for someone else.' - Who is she? 'Don't yell, I'm telling you. She's Dolly.' - Dolly? "There's no need to worry. She loves Hindi movies. Wow. - 'Oh, I forgot.' ' might be coming to Bombay for a few days." - When?? 'No need to stand. Sit down.' 'It's not fixed as yet. As soon as I get to know, I'll tell you.' 'Okay, I'm off. Dolly must be on her way.. '..and even though you haven't said so, I'll convey your affections.' There's no need. -'Okay, I won't! 'Hey. Here she comes. Okay, I'm going.' 'Give mom and dad my love. Take care, bye."- Stupid. Hi. Nisha, where have you put that cassette you took from my car? There was a really important music piece of our play on it. Anything that goes into your room vanishes forever. Where is the cassette? Rahul, don't you have the manners.. ...to knock before coming into a girl's room. Is there a girl here? ...Stop it, Rahul. I'm serious. Look, don't give me all this girl talk. Please! You have also entered my room at times when I had nothing on. So? That's different. - Why is it different? Don't I feel shy? Shut up, Rahul.. - You shut up! Go on now. Get my cassette. Oh. Thank.. First say sorry, and then you'll get the cassette. Must I say sorry? - Yes. Say sorry to you? - Yes. Why you.. Nisha. Nisha, give that here. Don't play stupid games with me. - You stupid. If ll catch you, you're dead. - I'm not giving it to you. I'll get you. Give me back my cassette. Come on, give me back my cassette. Give it to me. - I won't! Give it to me, I say. - Okay, okay. Now say you're sorry. - Sorry for what? Sorry that you've wasted my time, and made me run around. I'm not saying sorry. - You won't? I'm sorry. - Say you'll never annoy me again. I'll never annoy you. - Say 'Rahul is the best'. Never! Rahul is the best. Okay? - know. Thank you very much. Rahul is the worst. Rahul is a dog, Rahul is a monkey. Come what may, I'm not going to dance in your play. So be it. I'll find dancers like you aplenty. There isn't a single dancer as good as me. "Fall in love." "Fall in love." "Lose your heart to someone. Fall in love.." "Fall in love.." "You're still young. Someone out there is meant for you." "Find him, oh, lovelorn heart." Pooja! "You are young. There's somebody for you." My wedding has been fixed. - Wedding? I'm sorry. - Six, seven, eight. "Fall in love.." "Fall in love.." What's wrong with you, Anjali? You're going to marry someone you haven't chosen? Someone you hardly know. I do know him. He's Mr. Kapoor's son. I've known him for years. But you don't love him. Well, Pooja. Love will happen in due course. Love happens in due course? Are you saying that, Anjali? We're not kids any more, Pooja. It's time we out grew our world of fantasies. We are Indian girls. Our companion for life is never same as the man in our dreams. We don't even choose him. Someone else chooses him for us. We learn to love him. This is the truth, and the sooner you realise it, the better. Don't make this mistake, Anjali. Someone, somewhere is made for you.. ...and you should wait for him. Perhaps he is the one. I believe that this is the one who was made for me.. ...and I'm going to live through with this belief. And who knows? This might happen to you. Tomorrow you might marry a man whom you merely know.. ...and slowly you might realise that he was the one you were waiting for. "There's someone for you. You find him out.” Nothing like this is going to happen to me. I'll choose my companion myself. This is impossible, Rahul. There can't be a girl like this. What does that mean? - It's a meaningless character. Maya refuses to come out of her dreams. Modern girls aren't like this. What do you know? You're not a even girl. Stop it, Rahul. I'm serious. Modern girls.. - Maya is not one of these modern girls. She's different. She is my Maya. Your Maya, indeed. What do you know about girls? You know only one. And that's me! What do you mean? I don't know anything about love.. ...and yet I make love stories. What of it? Rahul, your Maya looks absolutely crazy to me. Don't you call my Maya crazy. And you are the only one who thinks like that. Nobody else talks like this. - Definitely! Rahul, I think Nisha is right. - Thank you. I don't understand 'Maya' either. Her character seems fake. Isn't it Raju. I agree. Looking at it from a psychological point of view.. ...1 feel that you're on your own trip of Utopia. I'm on a fantasy trip. I'm sorry, Maya is not in. I'm sorry. You want to say something too? - I think we need a lunch break. Exactly. See? I don't know if such a girl exists or not..and I don't want to. Whether she is a lie, a fantasy or crazy or whatever.. ...she's Maya. If you don't understand this, I'm very sorry, I can't help it.. ...But all of you get one thing straight. I am not going to change Maya's character, come what may. Excuse me. What's this? - I think Rahul's right. You shut up. You are Rahul's yes-man. I was only saying that.. - Okay.. what were you saying? Do you know of such a girl? - No! Is your Soni like this? - No. You figure the character of Maya? - No. Should we do this play? - Never. That's exactly what I've been saying. - Right, but.. Not again. - Hey, what is going on? What do you think you are doing? - Shut up. "That innocent face." "The mischief in her eyes.” "oh my!" "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "..stands afar shying away." "oh my!" "For a fleeting moment she shows herself, and then turns away" "oh my!" "If you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her." "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "..stands afar shying away." "oh my!" "For a fleeting moment she shows herself, and then turns away" "oh my!" "If you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her." "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "oh my!" "She's no ordinary girl, she's a wonder.” "How else can ll describe her?" "Last night she came in my dreams with her tresses flowing." "When I woke up, I wished I could return to my dream.” "If this is how I feel without meeting her.." "..what would happen when I do?" "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "..stands afar shying away" "oh my!" "For a fleeting moment she shows herself, and then turns away."” "oh my!" "If you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her." "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "oh my!" "Dark as the monsoon clouds is the kohl in her eyes” "Her gait has the grace of the waves in the ocean” "Wonder what He created her of." "1 wish she appears before me out of nowhere.” "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "..stands afar shying away" "oh my!" "For a fleeting moment she shows herself, and then turns away."” "oh my!" "If you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her" "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "..stands afar shying away" "oh my!" "oh my!" Yeah! - Hey, what are you all doing? Rahul, how do you like this? Hold this. Nisha, maybe you didn't notice that everyone is staring at us. So what? I don't care. - But I'm looking funny. Oh come on. How do you like the orange? Very nice. Nisha. - I'll be back in a moment. Nisha. *..you are requested to collect your parcels..' ...from the delivery counters.' Shopping? - Yes. Alone? - Yes. Very good! Never make the mistake of going shopping with a girl. How do you like this shirt? Cool, isn't it? - You like it? I really like it. -llove it! Let's go. Try it on once. - Both of us like it.. let's go. Rahul. - To hell with Rahul! So sweet! - What did you say? Nothing, nothing at all. Off you go! Who is it? Sorry! Idiot. Okay? Happy? Why are you laughing? What's up? Where are your jeans? I'm wearing it.. It happens. Who is it? Crazy! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday. Everybody clap.. Open the cake box. - Hey. Pooja. How did this happen? "What happened and when did it happen?” How did this get swapped over? I had ordered a chocolate cake. You must have picked up someone else's parcel. I'm so stupid! I should've checked. I'm sorry, uncle. - It's all right, dear. Other people celebrate their birthdays by cutting a cake. I'll celebrate mine by cutting sandwiches. No big deal. Come on. Come on. Let me see who got my cake. - Where are the candles? Rahul. - Pooja Who's Pooja? - I don't know. And who's uncle? - Must be Pooja's uncle. First time I sent you on an errand, and you picked the wrong parcel. What have I done? I brought the parcel the shopkeeper gave me. But you should have checked. Excuse me..but it wasn't up to me to check. Next time, do it yourself. Okay? I'm hungry and this cake looks awesome. Let's dig in. Stop it. No one's eating this cake. Why not? - Because it belongs to someone else. They must be eating our sandwiches too. There's an address written here. It's nearby. Go and return it. Are you nuts? This is someone's birthday cake, ordered with love. Someone's party will be ruined. Go and give it back. I'm not going. Rahul - To hell with Rahul! Jimmy, let's go and return it and say 'Happy Birthday!' Come on. So sweet! - What did you say? Nothing. Shut up! Yes? Good evening. Are you uncle? No, I'm aunty. Actually, by mistake I got your cake, aunty. The sandwich man. - That's right. Here's your cake, and wishing you a happy birthday. Thank you and sorry. Why sorry? - Because we've eaten all your sandwiches. That's all right. Actually, I ate a bit of your cake on the way here. No wonder! - Yes. Okay, I'll be off Uncle. - No. Come in, and have some cake. No thanks. I'm in a hurry. Some other time. Just a minute. Just one minute, please. Let the person who bought this cake thank you. There's no need. - No, no! Uncle. - Pooja, Pooja. Pooja, Pooja. - Yes, Uncle. That poor man, whose sandwiches you picked up by mistake.. ...has brought the cake back. - How sweet! He's at the door. Go and thank him. - Okay. Thank him. - Okay. "The cake has brought a twinkle in my eyes.." "..and a musical rhythm to the strings of my stomach." "The cake is here." To fit or not to fit. Not to fit. What a fool! 'We welcome you.' 'Happy Valentines Day.' Why are you buying all this stuff? Come on, Anjali. It's Valentine's Day today. Valentine's day? What is this Valentine's day? - Don't you know? The one you love most in the world is called your Valentine. On this day, all lovers pour their hearts out to each other. This is all about love. You won't understand. Very funny! But whom are you buying all these things for? For myself. - What? Look, I don't have a lover who'd buy me all these lovely things. So I'm pleasing myself. You've lost it. Do you know, today is no ordinary Valentine's Day. It falls on the same day as the full moon. Know what this means? I don't, but I'm sure you're going to tell me. It means that if you believe that someone is made for you.. ...and you are waiting for him with a true heart.. ...you would certainly meet him today. And you really believe this? Of course. I'm absolutely sure.. ...that before midnight I shall meet my soul mate. Pooja, you're really mad. - That I am. Rahul. - Forget Rahul! I'm going home. You can come along if you want to. Rahul, we all came together and we'll all go together. This is a very boring party. Tell me if you want to come. Rahul, when will you grow up? Look, how beautiful the night is, and you're so unromantic. Just look at those couples. They look so lovely.. ...dancing in each other's arms. You think that they're all in love? - Of course. Sit down. Tell me something, Nisha. What do you think.. what is love? Love is when you're so fond of someone.. ...that you want to spend the rest of your life in his arms. That's what we call love. I see. You think all these people here.. ...want to spend the rest of their lives with each other? 1 think so. Girls are so dumb. Do you know, most of these romances would be over before the night is? They'll fight over small things.. ...and will never see each other after tonight. And next year, you will see the same faces.. ...at the same place but in different arms. Boys are so stupid. - I'm telling you the truth, Nisha. You must agree that you need to know someone really well.. ...to spend your life together. - That's right. And in order to know someone well you need to spend time together? True. - In today's times, who has the time? Look. In this party, no one's known each other.. ...for as long as we've known each other. Does that mean that we can spend a lifetime with each other? Let me put it this way. Will you be able to spend a lifetime with me? Here you are, Rahul. And everyone wants you outside! Why? - Nothing as such. Everyone wants a song from you. Oh no.. - Oh, come on. - 1 don't want to sing. "Tell me, will you be able 10 spend a lifetime with me?* Yes Rahul, I can. I could spend my whole life with you. Rahul, Rahul, Rahul, Rahul. Rahul, Rahul, Rahul, Rahul. Rahul, Rahul, Rahul, Rahul. "The moon whispered something.." "..which the night heard.." "The moon whispered something, which the night heard." "Did you?" "Fall in love." "The moonlight came..to say.. "The moonlight came..” "..to my street and to my house, to say.." "Fall in love." "The moon whispered something.." "..which the night heard.." "Did you?" "Fall in love." “"What can I say, what can ll do?” "This strange thing that has happened to me." "It is a sign or did my heart whisper.." "It is a sign or did my heart whisper.."

"But who's voice is this that says.." "Fall in love." "Fall in love." "The moon whispered something.." "..which the night heard.." "Did you?" "Fall in love." "My love is oblivious to the one I lost my heart and soul to." "My love is oblivious to the one I lost my heart and soul to." “"But ll can't complain. I can't call him unfaithful.” "I heard the words which he never spoke." "Oh, my heart, be careful while you.." "Fall in love." "The moon whispered something.." "..which the night heard.." "Did you?" "Fall in love." "The moonlight came..to say.." "The moonlight came..” "To my street and to my house, to say.." "Fall in love." "Fall in love." "Fall in love." Happy Valentine's Day. Dance. Dance. Hello? - Have you lost it? Are you out of your mind? Why did you leave without telling anyone? You said we had come together, and we'd all leave together. Then you run away all on your own. You know that we're all worried. Idiot. Stupid. Fool. Hello? This is not 6711237, is it? No. - I thought so. I'm sorry, I thought it was someone else. You're right. ll am someone else.

Yes. - I thought so. You know, I wanted to buy it too. Where did you buy it from? From Rhythm House. - Ihaven't been there. Do you think they'd have it in stock? How would I know? I'm so stupid. How would you know? You don't work there, right? I'm really sorry about all this. It's okay. - Good night Good night. - I'm really very sorry. It's okay. - Happy Valentine's. Happy Valentine's.

You scared the hell out of me. How far will you run? Wait till I get you. - There comes the fatty. How dare you call me fatty? Dare you scare me. Move aside, Uncle. - Take this. Catch me if you can, fatty. You called me fatty again? Aunt, look at him. Aunt! Wait till I get you. Tired? Shall we? Cut it! Ballu! What are you up to? - Why, what's wrong, Rahul? The spotlight should move from me to Nisha after the drum roll. And I thought.. - Shut up. Come on, Nisha. Do it again. Let's take it from the top. Rahul.. - Rahul's done for! What is it? Please pack up early today. - Why? What's special about today? Nothing. Come on. - Come on, let's take it from the top. Rahul, you forgot? It's Nisha's birthday. Really? Why didn't someone tell me? - Yes. Nisha, what's wrong with you? - Catch. Thanks. Why didn't you tell me? There are some things, Rahul, which one knows without being told. Even then.. you people should have said something. Honestly, you guys are the limit.. Rahul! Just relax! - I'm very angry. Rahul! Just relax. - Very angry. You've been forgetting it all these years. This is just another year. Stop drop that stupid face, and take us all out to dinner. Come on. Yeah! - Come on guys, let's go. Nisha. What is it? Happy birthday. You remembered? Why didn't you say it? There are some things which one knows without being told. You idiot! Thank you. - It's okay, Nisha.-Yes. Let's rehearse. - Rahul. Just joking. Come on, everybody. Then she didn't agree at all. - So sweet. Cheers! - Okay, everybody. Tequila time. Rahul, I want the bigger one. Yes, the largest one. Raju, for you? Jimmy okay. - What are you guys drinking? Tequila. I want some. - This isn't for girls. Go, and have a soft drink. No, I want some. - I told you. This is not for you. It's my birthday today. Happy birthday. - Thank you. I'll do as I please. Nisha. Okay, suit yourself. Pepsi. Give me another glass. So sweet. Nothing. You're in love? Give over. I know your kind of love. It changes every week. This is your kind of love, not mine. You mean, the marrying kind? Really? Who's the girl? Do I know her? Really well. Tell me who she is, please. Ajay. Must 1? - Yes. Forget it. - Ajay. - That hurts. Okay! One, two, three, go!

Nisha! "1 feel lonely..” - Nisha, shut up! - Rahul is a bad boy. Nisha, please. Shut up now. Yes. "Don't say a word.

Don't leave me, I'm scared. It's really late. Now quietly go to sleep. Good night. No. First promise me that you won't leave me. Okay, fine. I won't leave you alone. You won't leave me, even if I ask for an ice-cream, will you? No, I won't. You won't leave me, even if ll don't dance well, will you? No, I won't.

I love you. Pooja! There she is..still asleep! Come on, Pooja. It's 7:00am The sun is up, Pooja. Pooja. What is it? What is it? You? You idiot. Is this the way to wake someone up? I'm so sorry, but seeing you fast asleep, I just couldn't resist it. How could I miss out on such an opportunity? You idiot. Stupid. - I'm sorry.. sorry, sorry Listen, get ready quickly. We've got to go to the airport. Airport? Are you going somewhere? No. We are. We? And where are we going? Well, that's a surprise. It's not far from India, it's nearby. We'll return by tonight's flight. Get ready quickly. I don't get you. Silly. It's very simple. I have to go on some business. It'll take me just an hour..just sign some papers.. ...and then I am free. If you come along, you'll see a new city .. ...as well as get some shopping done. And anyway I'm leaving for London tomorrow. That leaves only today.. ...which I want to spend with you. So simple. But Ajay, I must find out if it's okay with uncle and aunt. I've already got their approval. It's only you who has to decide. So fatty, are you coming or not? Of course, I'm coming! - That's great. Then hurry up and get ready. The flight is on time. Wait a minute. What's that under your eye? Where? - There. Now wait, you fatty! Stop there, fatty! Never mind. I'll get you for this. - Come and get me. Oh! You're going shopping, aren't you? We'll see. "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted.” "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted.” "It makes lovers meet for the first time.." "..it ignites passion in their hearts."

"..,Al101 are requested to see the immigration office..' .-Well, Mister Ajay. Time to go. Now I'll have to go. - Did you say something? Pooja, I want to tell you something. Tell me. What is it? This quick business trip of a couple of days was all a pretence. I came here for something else. It's been eight years since I left India. I've earned enough of respect and money. I've had enough of this hectic life. I want to stop now. I want to settle down now. And whenever ll close my eyes.. ...to think whom I'd like to spend the rest of my life with.. ...it is always your face that I see. In those moments we spent together, ll don't know how or when.. ...my feelings for you turned to love. But I had no clue about your feelings. I don't know whether you like someone.. ...whether there is anyone in your life. That's what ll came here to find out. I don't know what you think of me. I don't even know if you would want to spend your whole life with me. But ll know for sure thatl love you.. ...and ll want to marry you. "This is the last and final call for passengers travelling.. *..on Air India's flight Al 101 to London.' I'll go towards the departure gate now. Once I'm there, I'll turn around and look. If your answer is affirmative, stay here. And if you're not here, I'll understand. And one more thing. Don't forget that whatever your decision is.. ...we were friends, we are friends, and we'll always be friends. Okay? "Who knows, it may happen to you too! 'You might end up marrying a man..' '..you only know but don't love.' '..and then gradually you realise that he's the one.. *.whom you've been waiting for.' What? But why did you stay? Sometimes, there's so much joy in making someone else happy.. ...that I can't think of anything else. You should have seen his face, Anjali. He was so happy. I have never seen him so happy. And what about your happiness? You don't love him, Pooja. Love? What about love? It happens in due course. Isn't it? And we are Indian girls. We can't choose our life partners. Someone else chooses our life partners for us. We learn to love them. Isn't that true? The girl finally outgrows her dreams and turns to a woman. No, Anjali. The girl has become a woman.. ...but she hasn't given up her dreams. She believes in them completely, even now. She's sure that Ajay is the one for whom she has always been waiting. Maybe He is delaying the indication. I'm sure that you'll be very happy with Ajay. I hope so. What happened, Nisha? Take her to the doctor, hurry. Slow down, Rahul. We're almost there. Slow down. Get a stretcher, Suppandi. Admit her. - Take this. - Okay, sir. Hi, Doctor. - There's no need to worry. It's a small fracture. She'll go home in a week or so. I told you Nisha would start dancing again in a week. I'm talking about going home, not dancing. She can't dance for another three months. Three months? - Yes, Rahul. Her heel is very delicate. If she doesn't take care, the fracture could recur.. ...and it could be more serious. Does she know this. - Yes. - May I see her? Of course. You don't need my permission. - Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you guys. Who's going to get me a cup of tea? God! You'll never learn to knock, will you? Don't give me that girl talk. I have something very important to discuss. Yes, tell me. - Can you see me properly? How many fingers? Stop it, Rahul. - Jokes apart. Okay! Look, this Dr. Kapoor of yours isn't up to much. I think you should see some other doctor. - Why? This doctor was talking about getting you discharged in a week. So what? - No, it's not done. It's been such a task getting you to the hospital. You should spend at least a month or two in here. Mean..- And while you are away, we'll also have some peace. Rahul, I hate you. You're so horrible. - Slowly.. You're always making fun of me. I hate you. You're so bad. Nisha, behave yourself. Sorry, nurse. She has gone mad with the pain. But don't worry, I'll take care of her. I'm a psychologist. Sis.. - Rahul. Yes? - I'm sorry. For what? I've put you through so much trouble. You've taken so much money from the sponsors.. ...and how would you find a dancer so soon? And for three months, I.. - Now look.. ...there's no need for you to worry. Rahul. - Rahul's done for! What do you think? You're a good dancer? There are scores of fabulous dancers in town. Sure, but you'll never find.. - A dancer like you, right? Right. - Now you don't worry about this. Now get some rest and I'll see you in the evening. Okay. - And you don't need to eat the boring hospital food. I'll bring some food. We'll eat together. It's a deal. Right? Bye. - Bye. Rahul. - I know. Chinese, right? Right. Not to worry. It'll all work out. - How will it all work out? We've borrowed money from the sponsors, ...and paid a deposit for the stadium. Where are we going to find a dancer like Nisha? Come on, if we try, don't you think we can find one good dancer? There are plenty of dance schools. One is right next to our rehearsal hall. We'll find a dancer there tomorrow. Yes! Yes, Jimmy. You're right. How about that, Rahul? Come on, relax. Whatever happens will be for the best. Let's go, and have some chilled beer. No.. You go ahead. I'm not in the mood. - Come on, buddy! Relax, pal. Try to understand. He's tired. Come on, we'll push off. - See you guys. Take care. Bye, bye. - Come on, Supandi. - I'll see you.? First you give me your address and phone number. Maya.. I'll find her. Maya. "Water, water.” "Water, water in my eyes." - Excuse me.. The sandwich man. Shanti, has a parcel come here by mistake? - No.. Il haven't come for a parcel today. - Then tell me what ll can do for you. I want to meet your daughter. - I don't have a daughter. No daughter? - No. Then sir, Ms. Pooja Malhotra? Pooja is like my daughter. - I see. But how do you know her? I saw her last night. - Night? Where? - In the dancing school. She dances really well. - So? So, I wanted to meet her. - What for? I wanted to ask her something. - What did you want to ask her? If she'd..sort of..with me.. - What with you? If she'd work with me. - What work? I do plays, and I'm looking for a dancer - You are doing a play. Yes. Are you a director? - Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me before? I did, when you asked me. - I'm sorry. Come on in. Actually, I'm a singer. - I see. I've done years of practice. Sit.. As it happens with many great artistes.. ...you don't really meet too many connoisseurs. You've met me today. You don't know how lucky you are. I know, sir but I've come to meet Pooja. Now that you have met me, you'll meet Pooja, too. I won't give you a penny more than 75. The prices have gone up, ma'am. Rs.80, no less. Only last week I bought it at.. ...that price and the prices have shot up within a week? Trust me, ma'am. That's the correct price. You can taste for yourself how sweet it is. I will give you Rs.75 and no more. - Seventy five.. Show me the watermelon. - Here you are, sir. - Show.. Seventy-five is the right price. How many do you want, Ma'am? Just one. - Pack this for Ma'am. But.. - Oh, come on! It's your first sale in the day, and you're haggling for five bucks? Come on, give it to ma'am. I'm there. Hi. - Hi. Recognise me? We met last night at your dancing school. Remember? - Oh, yes. I'm Rahul. You must've heard of me? No. Well, never mind. Actually you are a pretty good dancer. Thank you. Actually, I'm doing some musical shows.. ...and I need a special dancer for a special role. When I saw you dancing yesterday.. ...I thought that you'd be ideal for this. So what do you think? Would you be interested? No, thanks. Rahul is done for. Sir, watermelon! My career's at stake here and all you can think of is that watermelon. Here, take this. Watermelon. Excuse me, but perhaps you misunderstand me. The shows I'm talking about are no ordinary shows. Here ll am. They're high-class shows with a very high-class audience.. ...and ll am sure you would also enjoy doing it. Why don't you give it a try? Not for me, for the sake of art. Dancing is my hobby. - That's really good. But dancing on stage in front of an audience makes me nervous. What's there to be nervous? - I don't think ll can do it. No, no. - I'm sorry.. - No problem. Just.. Take 3. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Look, I'm in a tight spot. Actually, my lead dancer has fractured her foot. I've already borrowed money for the show. If we don't perform, I'll not only incur a loss but also lose face. Just come once for a rehearsal, and if you don't like it, it's fine. But please, just once. Please come to the rehearsal. I'm really very sorry. - Please -1 can't do it. Please. - Why don't you hire someone else? I beg of you, please. - What are you doing? You don't know me. I'm a stubborn and crazy guy. I'm not budging until you agree. - Look. Please get up. Please come just once to a rehearsal. Don't come back if you don't want to. - Everyone's looking at us. Please. Please come, just once! Okay. I'll come. -You will? Promise? - Promise. When? - Tomorrow. - What time? 2:00pm. - Can't you come at one? Okay, I'll come at one. - Thank you very much. Thank you for all this. By the way, I hope you know that.. ...our rehearsal hall is right next to your dancing school. I know. - We're neighbours, you know. - I know. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ma'am. You'll come, won't you? Yes, you will. Ma'am. Yes. For you. Yes. He's crazy. How is this sketch? - No that good. This one's better. Sir. That's okay. But this one, this is what I don't like. Make this proper. I'll do that. The colour scheme's okay. Okay. But look at this one, here, this one.. Rahul, you said that girl would come at 1:00pm.. It's already 4:00pm. I don't think she"ll come. So what should I do? So if she doesn't come, won't we do our play? I was only.. - Go and get on with your own thing. Go. - Okay, relax. What happened? - Please, don't disturb me. Quiet, quiet everybody. Ballu, spotlight on the entrance. Hi. - Hi. Rahul. You must've heard of me? Cut it. No, no. No, Pooja. No. No, Pooja. You're not putting your heart into it. You are concentrating more on the steps and music. I don't want to see how well you dance. I have already seen that, and you are very good. I want to see whether you are Maya or not. I want to see the zenith of Maya's love and passion. I want to see what happens when Maya pours her heart out. Right? Okay. We'll try it once more. All right, music. Cut it! Why don't you understand what I'm trying to tell you? Forget that there's anyone sitting here. Forget that there's music playing. Forget that this is a rehearsal. Just think of Maya. God knows where you're lost. I've cried myself hoarse that ll don't want to see your dance. Il don't want to see you dance. ll want to see your madness! Maya's madness.. I'm sorry, Pooja. - Don't touch me. I'm really sorry, Pooja. ll was just.. Never in my life has anyone yelled at me like that. I know, Pooja. I'm an idiot. I don't know how to talk to girls. I told you I can't do it. But you're doing it really well. It's just that I'm going on about Maya. I don't understand this Maya. - Never mind.. I don't want to do this. - Don't worry if you don't understand. We don't have to do this today. We can do it tomorrow. Okay? I don't want to do it tomorrow either. I'm not doing this. - Okay. Maya, relax. - My name is Pooja. Of course, it's Pooja. I'm sorry. Sit down, please. Sit I'm really sorry, Pooja. Don't dance if you don't want to.. ...but please stop crying. Don't want water”? No problem. You see Pooja, it's a habit with me to yell during rehearsals. I wasn't having a go at you. I was only trying to explain to you about Maya that's all. Pooja, maybe you just don't understand Maya. Maya is the kind of girl.. ...who lives in a dream world. She believes that one day her dream prince will come.. ...and carry her away. Her friends have always made fun of her.. ...but that did not shake her belief. And today, she has met the man of her dreams.. ...and she's dancing. There is love in her dance.. There's mad passion and arrogance. As if to say, "I knew he would come..” *..and now, see, he has come." "My dream man has come." Music. Wow, wonderful. - Brilliant. - Brilliant. - Thank you. It was nice. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Nisha, I can't believe we got such a good girl so quickly! Had I not got the right girl for this role.. ...I'd have cancelled the play.. ...given back the money, and willingly faced the music. But I was destined to meet Pooja. Her name is Pooja? - No, it's Jeetendra. Of course it's Pooja. Is she beautiful? - Really beautiful. Remember how I described Maya? She's just like her. That innocent face, those dreamy eyes and that bashfulness. She is too good, Nisha. She's brilliant. Yes. Is she a good dancer? When she dances, you can't take your eyes off her. I know that you will go crazy when you see her. I see. - Yes. But can she act? But of course, she can. If she can't act, what am I for? If ]I can get you to act ll can get anyone to act. Very funny. There's no water, no soft drink and you've called me for dinner. Wait a minute, and I'll get something to drink. Rahul. Is she as good a dancer as me? Are you crazy? There's no dancer as good as you. Right. - Right. Idiot. Can't even lie properly. There go your pants. The stitches gave away. Hey Shruti, get my bag. - Relax. Let's go! -Okay, we'll push off now. See you tomorrow.. Bye.. - See you tomorrow. May I say something, Pooja? - What? When you smile.. - I know, I look good. Then? When you laugh, it rains. Give it back. "With the gait of a horse, with the majesty of an elephant.” "Oh, king of the rains, where do you come from?" "With the gait of a horse, with the majesty of an elephant.” "Oh, king of the rains, where do you come from?" "1 know a girl, when she smiles..” "1 know a girl, when she smiles, the rains come pouring down." "1 know a girl, when she smiles, the rains come pouring down." "I know a boy, when he sings.." "I know a boy, when he sings, the rain clouds mask the sky." "I know a boy, when he sings, the rain clouds mask the sky." "The clouds have descended.." "They stand in our path." "Tell us what your intentions are, oh clouds.” "Won't you let us go home?" "There's rain ahead, a storm behind." "The weather is treacherous. Oh, where can we go?" "1 know a girl, when she smiles, the rains come pouring down." "I know a boy, when he sings, the rain clouds mask the sky." "The heavy sky stoops low with clouds." "Everything has come to a standstill.” "How lovely is this season." "Take the sign of the rains." "In such a weather, say something.." "..do something. Why do you stand silent?" "With the gait of a horse, with the majesty of an elephant.” "Oh king of the rains, where do you come from?" "With the gait of a horse, with the majesty of an elephant.” "Oh king of the rains, where do you come from?" "1 know a girl, when she smiles, the rains come pouring down." "I know a boy, when he sings, the rain clouds mask the sky." The doctor has said clearly that you can't go out of the house. There's no need for you to strain yourself trying to get up. Now get into your bed, and rest. Who are you calling now? Rahul. - Oh yes, he called.. .-To say that he's at Soni's house. At Soni's? Oh yes, Soni and Jimmy are getting engaged today. Aunt, get my clothes out quickly. I want to go there. I'll just come. Look, I'll call the doctor. - Aunt, please! She just won't listen. "The girl is beautiful..” "The boy looks morose.." "The two don't match..” "The two don't match.."” "They don't make a good pair.." I'll not give this to you. I hate these weddings. I don't understand why people get married. If two people have decided to spend their whole lives together.. ...why are the others making such a fuss? Why are they all getting excited? These days it has become a fashion.. ...to have seven days long wedding celebrations. Give me a break. Get married, have a quiet ceremony, and then go home and sleep. I've even come to hate the word 'marriage'. Excuse me, may I have another one? But the one good thing is that in all this fuss.. ...you get lots of goodies to eat. Thank you. Have you eaten? Later. - Let's sit. I really love weddings. The small rituals, dancing, singing, and making merry.. ...1 love every bit of it. - Very good. I'm going to have all of them at my wedding. Are you getting married? Yes. I mean, you never mentioned it. When are you going to do it? Actually, nothing is fixed yet. He works abroad. When he comes back.. ...we'll fix a date when we've found an auspicious time. That's why I haven't mentioned this to anyone. I see. Congratulations. Thanks. Rahul, when are you getting married to Nisha? Nisha and me? Are you crazy? The two of us are just good friends. There's no chance of us ever getting married.. ...and in any case marriage and me, no thank you. Actually, I don't believe at all in the institution of marriage. I don't know how two people decide.. ...to spend their whole life with each other. 1 fail to understand and I'm certain.. ...there can't be a girl who could spend her whole life with me! You're mistaken. There is one such girl. Where is she? - Somewhere or the other. Rubbish. I've always believed that God made all relationships of the heart. But then He left it to us to find each other. He created all of us in pairs. For every one of us there is a soul-mate. You just have to wait till you meet her. Do you think that's true? At least in my life, that's the ultimate truth. True. That means that you've found your soul mate. Yes. I've found him. I found my soul mate. Something is amiss. - What? The dessert is amazing. Have some. - No. Okay. I don't know where he keeps it.. ...Nisha! When were you discharged from the hospital? - Hey, Ballu. I ran away from hospital. - Great. Jimmy and Soni will be delighted to see you. Where are they? - They are sitting in the lawn, go and meet them. Rahul is there, isn't he? - Rahul's gone to drop Pooja home. Ballu. - Coming. You go ahead. "He has come, he has come with a sword.." Pooja. Thanks. See you tomorrow. Pooja. - What? It's that story you told me at Soni's. That some special girl is made for me..etc, etc.. I've been thinking about that. I don't get something. - What? How would I know who's made for me? You have so much faith in this theory. I'm sure you know how I'm going to meet this girl. I mean, will she be holding a placard with my name on it? Or, when I see her would there be a clap of thunder.. ...and a bolt of lightning? Would music start playing? What would happen? He will tell you. He will give just one sign.. ...and your heart would recognise the girl. I've tried reasoning with her.. but she just wouldn't listen. She does what she wants. - Hi, Doctor. Doctor. - Rahul, good you came. I'm fed up with this girl. - Why? What happened? I told her clearly that she needs to stay at home to rest. But look at her, she's packing her bags to go somewhere. Where to? - How would I know? I've tried my best to explain. - She doesn't listen to me. You're the only one who could convince her. Don't worry, she won't go anywhere. I'll go in and take her to task right away. Okay? - Best of luck. - Okay, see you. - Bye Nisha. What are you doing, Nisha? Are you nuts? The doctor told you to rest, right? By the way, where are you off to? I'm going to London. - London? Well, Mum and Dad keep calling me.. ...and it's been months since I met them. I thought I'd visit them. Besides, I want to run away from here. Want to run away? From whom? From myself. - What's all this nonsense, Nisha? I've begun to get scared of myself, Rahul. I want to leave.. ...so that I can avoid doing things like the one I did yesterday. Nisha, you haven't done anything of the sort. You were just dancing. Look here.. - Rahul.. ...now we should stop evading the truth. We both know what the problem is. What's the problem? The problem is that.. ...-1 love you, and you don't love me. Look here, Nisha.. - I know.. ...that you know how much I love you. That night I wasn't sozzled enough.. ...to not hear what my heart was saying. Actually, Rahul, we've become such good friends.. ...that we take each other for granted. So ll think that a bit of space will give us time to think. But I'm sure.. ...that when I'm not here, you'll miss me a lot. Then maybe then you'd realise my worth. One thing is certain, that an idiot like you.. ...doesn't deserve a girl like me. And ll don't know why, but ll feel that.. . When ll come back.. ...you'll be on your knees begging me to get married to you. And who knows at that point in time I may not be in the mood for it. Get lost. Well, maybe you haven't seen your face.. It's better than yours. Hey, Nisha.. - Rahul. Nisha, you're really nice. I know. Come on now.. I must meet everyone on my way to the airport. Come on, Rahul, hurry up. We'll see you. - Bye, see you guys. Take care.. - I'll really miss you. - Thanks. Bye. - Enjoy yourself. Take care. - Bye, Nisha. - Bye buddy. Rahul, has our stuff arrived? Ballu is mad. We haven't been properly introduced. Let's start from the beginning. Hi! I'm Nisha. - I'm Pooja. Now that we are friends.. ...will you forgive me for what I did yesterday? Forgive you? For what? Pooja, what I did with you yesterday, wasn't right. Actually, ever since this place was built.. ...I'm the only one who's danced on this floor. This floor has become my identity. So when I heard that someone else had taken my place.. I felt bad. Without seeing you or knowing you, I was jealous. I shouldn't have felt that way. Had I been in your place, I'd have done the same. Moreover, I really enjoyed dancing with you. You were the one dancing. I was doing something else. I'm really sorry, Pooja. - It's okay Come on, Nisha. The pilot of your flight just called for you. I always told Rahul that there could never be another dancer like me. But I can't say that any more. And I'm sure that.. ...no one can play the role of Maya better than you. Not even me. All the best.. Bye. See you. - Thank you! Bye. Come. Who is coming to drop me to the airport? - Me! Hi. I'm Rahul. You must have heard of me? I'm looking for a special dancer for a special role. I saw you dance yesterday and felt you would be ideal for this. Check, check.. 69.. Ballu, what are you doing? Throw the spotlight properly. Pooja, good, good. But.. I think that you are not opening up. I want to see how Maya looks when she's happy. I want to see the zenith of Maya's passion and love. Okay? Do it again. Okay. Quiet everybody. Take it from the top. Music! Cut it! Cut it! Haven't ll told you to forget that you are you.. ...to forget that there are people sitting here? Forget that there's a rehearsal going on here. But you refuse to understand. Pack up. I don't get one thing, Pooja. How I would know which girl was made for me? Will she be holding a placard with my name on it? When I see her, would there be a clap of thunder.. ...and a flash of lightning? "Oh dear, what's happening? I don't really know." "I only hope this does not turn into a tale of love." "Oh dear, what's going on? Nobody really knows." "But if this is a tale of love, then so be it." "Take my hand in yours, as long as you are here." "Let's sit talking, as long as we can." "Let's look into each other's eyes.."” "..as long as the night lasts.” "Oh dear, what's going on? Nobody really knows." "How do I describe the state of my heart?" "Even the dewdrops seem to burn, with the fever of my heart." "Why do I feel as if someone has caressed me" "Oh dear, what's going on?" "I don't really know." "I only hope this does not turn into a tale of love." "Oh dear, what's going on?" "Nobody really knows." "But if this is a tale of love.." "..then so be it." "Please move away for a while, so I can collect my feelings.." "..and calm the violent beating of my heart." "Let's slow down so that we don't move ahead of time." "Oh dear, what's happening? Nobody really knows." "There is something between us, don't deny it." "And no one know how far it would go." "For you should know, your heart is not what it was." "Oh dear, what's going on?" "I don't really know." 1 only hope.."” "..this does not turn into a tale of love." "Oh dear, what's going on?" "I don't really know" "1 only hope this does not.." "..turn into a tale of love." ll hope your uncle would be asleep so I won't have to hear him sing. Bye. - Bye Rahul, I forgot to tell you.. - What? I can't attend rehearsal tomorrow. - Why? Tomorrow I'm going to Khandala. - Khandala? Why? My sister lives there. - Which sister? She's my dance teacher. She taught me everything I know. It's her birthday tomorrow. If ll say no, will you not go? I'd go anyway, but if you said yes, I'd go happily. I'm joking. Go on. I'll look into the other jobs tomorrow. Thanks. Bye. - Bye. Rahul's done for. Rahul? What are you doing here? - Hi. I have a friend in Khandala. He's been asking me over for ages.. ...but I've never had a chance to go. And since we can't work without you.. ...I thought I'd meet him, and give you a ride too. As it is you're going alone, so I thought you'd have company. What are you staring at? Hurry up, hop in. If we go early we'll beat the traffic. Come on. Well, why are you smiling? Nothing. Let's go. Today I'm really missing my friend. Really. Tommy, Ceasar, quiet! Quiet! - Pooja, I'm scared of dogs. Pooja, Get them off me. - They won't do anything. Sister's taking a dance class there. I'll just go and surprise her. Stay here. Don't worry, they won't bite you. I'll be back. - Sir Tommy, please. Want some soft drink? You can have these flowers too. Sandhya, what are you doing? I'll give you one now. You've put on so much weight, you can hardly move. No more chocolates and ice creams for you. Get it right this time. Move the neck. Arms straight. You..Why are you laughing? Shut your mouth. If anyone gets it wrong then no one will watch TV tonight. Don't come begging me again, please sister. Please Sister, let me watch TV. Look. There comes your dear Pooja. Sister, how did you recognise me? There's no need to act smart. I know all my girls from the sound of their footsteps. Happy Birthday to you! What's this? You've brought me another ugly saree. Yes, I chose the ugliest ll could get my hands on. Thank you. - Go on, class is over. Where you are going? The class isn't over yet. Now I'm here, and the class is over. You're spoiling them rotten. They behave well all year round. And the moment you step here, they start misbehaving. Sometimes one should be spoilt. No! Sir Tommy, No! - What happened? Tommy, no! - Don't let him go! Nab him! Sister! Wait! He's Rahul, my friend. Your friend? - Yes! Leave him, girls. - Come on, leave him. Tommy, Ceasar, go inside. Go. - Tommy went? They're gone. Why are you so frightened? Hi! Happy Birthday! Ok. - Where are your feet? What are you up to? - I'm trying to touch your feet. Do I look that old? - Not at all but out of respect. Give me your hand. - Pardon me? Your hand. - Yes. Nice to meet you. Oh, you've caught a cold. Come, let's go in. - Yes Pooja please. Save me from the dogs. - They won't hurt you. You don't know. They're very dangerous. - Sister, who's he? I don't know but I'll have to find out. Pooja, you didn't tell me what Rahul does. Rahul? He directs plays. These days, I'm working with him. - I see. I think that you don't like Rahul specially. No, I like him very much. Very much? No, I mean to say, he's a good friend. Good friend? You mean you don't love him. Sister, Rahul's just a friend. A dear friend. I see.. a dear friend. It's not what you think.. ...and in any case, I wanted to tell you something. There's no need to tell me. ll understand everything. Stop it, Sister. Sister, you've got it all wrong. Pooja. Pooja. - Rahul. Rahul. Pooja. - Rahul, what's up? - Hi! W Hi! hat's up? Nothing. Why are you standing with the spoon? Come join us. Stupid! - Hey everybody! Come on everyone, follow me.. this way. Okay. Come on. If it's not love, then what is it? Sister.. honestly! - Look here, girl! I've known you since you were twelve years old. What your heart doesn't let you know, it tells me. The look in your eyes says that you love this boy very much. Now stop lying to me. Understood? Okay? "Just a dear friend". Listen, Sister.. "I can't recollect when this happened.” "It's become difficult to hide this secret from everyone.” "If you say so, today I'll ask God for something." "Oh dear, what's going on? I don't really know." "What this leads to.. - Let it become a romance." So when is Ajay coming back? Nothing is definite, but he could come at any time. Say D. Say O. Say N. Say K. - K. -Yes. Now say E. Say Y. - Y. - I'll be right back. Alright. Very good. Very good. Let's start all over again. Okay, okay. 0.0. N. - N. K. - Pooja, give me your hand. - Why? I won't hit you! Give me your hand. Here it is. Here. What's this? - Hush. Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Ever since you were a child.. ...you've always put others before yourself. I've always been overwhelmed by your behavior. But today this same behaviour has made me sad. But .. - Quiet! Sometimes, it's very important to think of oneself, Pooja. I see that you are running away from your dreams. You won't let them come true. Don't do this, Pooja. Not everybody is fortunate to have their dreams come true. Don't do this. Let me tell you something. One can fall in love many times. True love only happens once. The step you're unable to take.. ...Lord Ganpati will help you. He'll show you the right path. He'll give you the strength to fulfill your dreams. Keep Him with you always. I have faith in Him. The Lord will set everything right. I love you, Sister. Stop it! I don't want to make a habit of crying. Pooja! No. No way. You are very fat. Sister will scold me if I give this to you. Why are you frightened? - Pardon me? Why are you frightened of being in love? Tell her. Love and me? I was just.. Okay, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Nice to meet you. Take it! What's this? - This is, in a way, my blessing. I'm very stingy in such matters. I don't give my blessing that easily. But when I saw you I thought that perhaps you need it. This will help you to say what you're unable to say. Keep it very carefully. You get it? - Got it. Bye. - Bye. - She's on her way. If you can't say it, then I'll say it.. - I'll say it. Definitely? - Definitely. Okay. - Okay. Mark my words carefully. Bye! - Bye. Bye! - Good bye, Sister! Bye! - Bye, Sister! Okay! Okay! First, the bride. You can drink straight from the bottle. Okay. Here's to Soni and Jimmy. Everyone together. Cheers. For the most beautiful couple I've seen. And now I'm going to give a speech. Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.. May I have your attention, please? Aunty, please.. thank you. Since I am Jimmy's best man.. ...it's my good fortune to make a speech.. ...and it's your misfortune that you all have to listen to it. Till today, I didn't understand how two people can take a vow.. ...to spend their entire lives with each other. I didn't believe in these vows of marriage. And seeing Jimmy and Soni together.. ...only strengthened my conviction. Because there can't be anyone as innocent as Soni.. ...and there can't be a scamp to beat Jimmy. I used to worry that Soni and Jimmy are too different.. ...to spend their lives together. But today, I realise that I was wrong. I'm a little ashamed to admit.. ...that I have started believing in love. The kind of love in which lips don't speak.. ...eyes do. The kind of love that binds two people together forever. And today, I keep thinking of just one thing. I remember something.. ...a very dear friend told me.. ...about God.. ...God has already brought hearts together.. ...but then He left the hearts to find each other. He made us all in pairs. For every one of us, somewhere, there's one soul mate just for us. He made Soni for Jimmy. Today, to that God.. ...1 give thanks for bringing Jimmy and Soni together. ...and I pray that.. ...He may give each one of us the ability to recognise our soul mate. Thank you. Thank you. My bangle? Rahul, have you seen my bangle? Darn! Now I'm sure I won't find it. It was my favourite bangle. - Mine, too. Rahul! Come on, give it to me. Come here and take it. What childish behavior! Give it to me! Come closer. Here goes.. happy? Come closer. Rahul! - Closer.. Stop it! Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "We'd rather have died than reveal our secret.” "Oh, my love." "Oh, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." “"You were a few steps away from me. 1, a few steps away from you.” “"You were a few steps away from me. 1, a few steps away from you.” "Yet we may as well have been hundreds of miles apart” "Step by step our wavering hearts came together.” "Oh, my love." "Oh, my love" "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "Come, you have won me over and I am defeated by my heart." "Come, you have won me over and I am defeated by my heart." "Today, with great difficulty my lips say love." "Now I'm wildly in love.." "..don't ever leave me.." "..don't ever leave me, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "We would rather have died than reveal our secret.” "Oh, my love." "Oh, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something.” "You say something, I'll say something, my love." Careful. Hey, Suppandi, watch the scenery. Jimmy, watch Soni. What's up, Supandi? Tell me. Oh. - I'm coming. I'm coming. Just do this for me. How much do I work tell me? - Keep this on top. Take it. - Where's Pooja? She's nowhere to be seen. Rahul! The set is ready. Good, well done. Call Pooja. - Okay. Shruti. Call Pooja. - Yes! Pooja, we're ready. Are you angry with me? - Not at all. Then why aren't you speaking to me? I am speaking to you. For three days, I haven't seen your face or heard your voice. I was very busy. I have been calling you everyday. Why haven't you been answering? The phone has been out of order for some time. What is the problem? Tell me. I want to know the cause of your restlessness. There's no problem. - There is a problem. Serious problem. The fact is that we both love each other very much. We can't tell each other about it. Today, I've come here to tell you.. ...that I love you. I love you very much. And I know that you also love me. So then, say it once.. ...and that will be the end of your restlessness. Everything will be all right. I don't love you. - You're lying. I'm not lying. - You aren't? Look into my eyes and tell me.. ...that we weren't made for each other. We weren't. Tell me that when I leave you, you don't turn to look at me. I don't. Tell me that nothing happens to you when I touch you. Nothing. - Tell me.. ...that you don't want to come into my arms right now. I don't. Look into my eyes just once.. ...and tell me that you don't love me. I don't.. "For each other." - I don't.. "For each other." - I don't.. I don't.. I don't.. Terrific performance! Very well done! Excellent! Fabulous Rahul! Wonderful. Fantastic. - Thank you, buddy. Rahul, there was no problem with my lighting, was there? Soni, I'd told you. - Nisha! Nisha. ?Let's go and give her a warm welcome. - Welcome. Hi. - Hi! Great to see you back again. Hi. - Hi. Oh, Raju, I'd told you she'd come back soon. - Hi. 'But I'm sure that when I'm not here..' ...you'll remember me often..' *..and ll don't know why, but when I get back..' *..you"ll be on your knees begging me to marry you.' 'And then perhaps I may not be in the mood for marrying.' Well, I'll be off. I'm a little tired. I'll see you all tomorrow. Okay. As you wish. - Bye. What's up with Nisha? - She's tired. She'll come tomorrow. Don't get unnecessarily worried. I'm not a nice girl, Rahul. I'm bad. I'm really bad. No Nisha, you're my friend. And no friend of mine is bad. No, Rahul, you don't know.. ...that I'm not a nice girl. Now you see.. ...-1 love a boy.. ...and have always loved him.. ...and today I realised that he doesn't love me. He loves someone else. I feel bad.. I'm hurt.. I'm upset. I feel jealous. Rahul, I shouldn't feel like this. I'm bad. I'm very bad. No, Nisha.. - No, Rahul. Actually, that boy isn't just the one ll love.. ...but he's also my best friend. Today, for the first time, ll saw love in his eyes. I couldn't bring that love in all these years.. ...but that other girl has. Perhaps they are made for each other. Perhaps I was never meant for him. Perhaps her love for him is true. So you see, I should be happy for my friend. I should revel in his happiness. But I'm not happy.. I'm not! I'm very bad.. ...really very bad. Nisha, you're not bad.. ...you're really nice. You know who is bad? He is bad.. The One who plays around with us mortals.. ...making A love B.. ...while B loves C.. ...and C loves D.. I don't know why He does this. When He makes one person love another.. ...He ought to make sure that the other one also loves her in return. Right? But that's not what He does. He's really bad. He's really bad. You're not bad. He's bad. You're right.. It's He who's bad. He's bad! You're bad. I'm not. You're bad. I haven't done anything wrong. You are the one. You are bad. You are bad. You are bad. You are bad. I'm not bad. I'm not bad. - I'm sorry, Nisha. Don't say sorry, Rahul. Else, I'll cry. I'm sorry, Nisha. - Don't say sorry, I'll cry. Sorry. No, Rahul, don't say sorry. I'll break down. Rahul! Ajay.. ...when I was a little girl, you used to tease me about my dreams. When I used to tell you that I am looking for the one meant for me.. ...you would say that ll am crazy and silly. You'd say that when I grow up.. ...my dreams will vanish. But you know, I have grown up.. ...and my dreams have not vanished. They have grown with me. That day, at the airport, when you suddenly asked me to marry you.. .At first ll didn't realise what ll should do. Then I saw you going. But then I thought, I was crazy.. ...you were my dearest friend.. ...and the one who knew me the most. Who could be better for me? And I was standing lost in my thoughts. You left, and silly me made you a part of my dreams. I started believing that you were the one made for me. And then.. ...and then I met Rahul. You're marrying Pooja? What are you saying Ajay? But Pooja hasn't said anything to me about it. I had forbidden her from telling you. I wanted to tell you myself. Oh, God! I can hardly believe you! I'm so happy! When are you coming? I called just to tell you this. I'm coming tomorrow. - Tomorrow? What can I tell you about Rahul? Where do I begin? Well, you should realise that I've never met anyone like him. Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes a devil. Sometimes crazy.. and sometimes a genius. Sometimes he scolds so harshly.. ...and sometimes he makes funny faces to make me laugh. At times he's more stubborn than a child.. ...and at times he's a beloved companion. In three days? Oh, no. I want time to get things ready for a big wedding. Mom, I don't have time. The company's sending me to Japan for a year. You'll have to wait for eight to ten months. Think about it. I can't wait that long. All right, you come here, and I'll start the preparations. The dreams of your crazy girl have come true, Ajay. She's found the partner of her dreams.. ...and she wants to know whether.. ...she can make all her dreams come true. Can she make her dreams come true? Ajay phoned just now. He's told me everything. He's coming tomorrow, Pooja.. ...and he says to get the wedding organised as quickly as possible. You're a silly goose. You would tell me your smallest secrets.. ...and you hid such a big one from me? Come here.. ...sit by my side. You know, Pooja, ever since you came to this house.. ...I've had a dream in which.. ...one day, you'd become my daughter-in-law.. ...and I, your mother. But ll was afraid.. ...of how you two would be when you grew up. Whether you would be friends. Whether you'd take a liking to each other. Hence, I never revealed my heart's desire. I also wanted that.. ...you should decide, if at all you wanted it.. ...but not for my sake. I wanted you to choose Ajay out of your own free will. You don't know how happy I am, for I know.. ...that there cannot be a better girl.. ...than you for my son. Just watch. I'm going to give you a grand wedding. You have no idea how happy I am. May you live long. 1 want full lights and ll want to see.. ...M6 on both left and right of stage. Suppandi, in a while I want to hear the music tracks. Soni, the elevation should be three feet higher.. ...or else the audience on stage right will not know what is going on. When Ballu lights M6, one spot light will filter here on this side.. ...and the audience gets a glimpse of the entry before it happens. Rahul. - Hi Pooja. You just make sure this doesn't happen. I want them in complete.. - Rahul. Sure. Sure. - I'll take care of it. - Yes. I need to talk to you. The show opens in two days, we'll talk later. Shruti. Soni, you just take care of this. I'll see you. Hello. Show me all the costumes of act three's dream sequence. Always sitting with Soni. Never does any work. - That's not so. All are approved? - Yes, this one's approved. Yes. - Trials done? - Yes. - Rahul. Yes. - Rahul, I have to talk to you. Pooja, just a minute. I'll just finish this.. - But.. One minute. One minute. Shruti. Shruti, pay attention here. Okay.. tell me what's the problem? Shoot. Rahul, please try and understand what I am about to tell you. Rahul, Nisha's calling you. There's a call from the auditorium. - Darn. I forgot to talk to her. I'll be right back. Supandi you come with me.. - Rahul. Where's Nisha? Rahul, please be serious.. Ajay? My name is Ajay, but if you like you can call me Rahul. Fatso! I love you! - Nisha, you'd said.. I really missed you. Remember Pooja, I told you that I'd come to get you anytime any day? Here ll am. I came here after meeting mom. She is so elated. Hey, I hope you haven't changed your mind. You're marrying me, aren't you? Have you told your friends? I was going to.. - Hear that! I'll have to do that, too? Come on. I'll tell them all that we are getting married. Ladies and gentlemen.. I'm sorry for the intrusion. You don't know my name. It's Ajay. I'm Pooja's childhood friend. And since she hasn't found a worthy guy.. ...1 took pity on her, and I'm going to marry her. Congratulations! - Alright, okay. Thank you very much. Congratulations! - Thank you. Thank you. Okay, okay. In three days, we're getting married. ...and you all must come, with family. Okay. Definitely. - We'll all come. Rahul! Pooja, you're weird. Why didn't you tell us before? We had begun to feel that you were our Maya. We forgot you're Pooja, and you have your own private life.. ...and your own relationships and even prior commitments. We are really stupid! Oh, I forgot.. Pooja, congratulations. Thanks. - And this is.. This is Rahul, our director. Rahul, she likes your name a lot. She likes only the name? - I hope so, man! Congratulations. - Thank you. Rahul, I have a request. - Goon. May I take her away for an hour? - Oh, come on! You're taking her away forever from us. That will be in a ceremonious way. What say, Pooja? This is just a lunch date with Pooja. Do I have your permission? My permission! Now I'll have to get your permission to meet Pooja. Besides, now that you've come.. ...Pooja won't be happy here, will you Pooja? So, go on. I'll get by without you. Are you sure? - Yes, of course! Absolutely! You guys go, and have a good time. Go on. We have his permission.. let's go. - Go on. Okay guys. - Okay, see you. Bye. After three days, okay? - We'll be there. Bally, show me the final mix. Shruti, show me the sketches. And Nisha, call up the auditorium and tell them.. The thing is that.. ...in two days we're going on stage.. - Rahul! Lights! why aren't you showing me the lights. There are just two days, and you're taking it easy! Come on, the lights. Shruti, show me the sketches. Quickly bring the sketches here, fast! Tania, hurry up with the band. We've got to finish the music rehearsals, too! Come on, everybody. Faster everybody. Come on. This is our last meeting. I'm getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just assume that I was never a part of your life. As soon as I start to move, track me with the spotlight.. ...and the other will stay on Pooja. When I get right up to the audience.. ...then slowly dim the light. The show will be over.. The End. That's it. Any questions? I don't want any mistakes, okay? - Okay! Raj, everything all right? - Yes. Okay then, tomorrow be at the stadium on time. Pack up? - I'll take that. - All Right. Hey, Rahul. Something is bothering me. - What? I don't like the end of your story. - Why? This ending's too sad. A love story should always have a happy ending. The audience should come out smiling, right? People like to live in a dream world. They have seen many dreams.. ...now let them see a little reality. Every love story is like this in real life. Full of sorrow and pain. No, Nisha. This ending is absolutely right. There can't be another end to this love story. "1 know a girl, when she smiles..” ".it rains.” "I know a boy, when he sings.." ".it rains.” Jimmy, just go and check the next entry stage left. - Okay. The heart is crazy, just refuses to listen. "Oh dear, what's going on? I don't really know." "1 only hope this does not turn into a romance.” "Oh dear, what's going on? I don't really know." "But if this is a romance, then so be it." Pooja's last entry is after this. Get her ready, and bring her here. Don't worry. Nisha's getting her ready, and bringing her. Thanks. Don't make this mistake, Pooja. Very few people are lucky.. ...enough to love and to be loved. You can't break the tie which He has ordained. You can't break it. I've spent my years giving love the name of friendship. Now, you're going to spend the rest of your life.. ...giving friendship the name of love. This is a betrayal! A betrayal of love.. a betrayal of friendship. Don't do such a thing! This is our last meeting. I'm getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just assume that I was never a part of your life. I want to ask you something before I go. Did you ever love me.. ...even for a single day or a single moment? This line is not in the play. - Raju! Tell me just once.. ...have you ever really loved me? Even for a moment? What is Rahul saying? - Shut up. I won't leave without an answer to this question. I'm not going! Did you ever love me, even for a single moment? No. - What did you say? 1 didn't hear that. No. - Speak up, I couldn't hear. No. - Louder, louder Pooja.. No, I've never loved you. Not for a day, not for a moment. Never. That is all I wanted to hear. Rahul.. you'll remember my name, won't you? What can I tell you about Rahul? Where do I begin? Well, you should realise that I've never met anyone like him. Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes, a devil. Sometimes he's crazy, sometimes he's a genius. Sometimes, he scolds so harshly.. ...and sometimes he makes funny faces and makes me laugh. At times he's more stubborn than a child.. ...and at times he's a beloved companion. What he is or is not, I cannot really express in words.. ...but I don't know why, I feel that.. ...when he looks at me, I feel beautiful. When he laughs, I feel like dancing. When he's upset, I feel like holding him in my arms. When he loves me, my eyes fill with tears. He's made me realise.. ...that I am made for him.. and he for me. I love him very much.. ...not for one day or one moment.. ...but for my whole life. I love you, Rahul. I love you. Yes. Rahul! Now that I've seen them, I believe that someone, somewhere.. ...was made for me as well. Isn't that so? - Yes. My name is Ajay. Yours? I'm Nisha. - Nisha! Are you married? - What? "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted.” "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted.” "It brings along sleepless nights. It steals sleep and solace.” "It shows them the path of love." "It brings joy and tears." "The heart is crazy." "The heart is besotted.” "The heart is crazy." "The heart is besotted.” "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted.” "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted.”
