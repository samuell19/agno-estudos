THE BLACK SQUARE Not to cause alarm, but shouldn't Charly be here by now? Don't you want to call him? I mean, we only have 45 minutes. Without tickets or passports, it might get tight. -Listen, Nik. -Nils. -Charly never turns up late. -Okay. He's never been late. He's usually early. It gets on my nerves. He always comes too early. He has our bags. Don't you want to call again? Maybe he's waiting at the terminal. Ladies and gentlemen, dear passengers... And? Shit. Please go to check-in immediately. Well... Then plan B. They must have nabbed Charly. Let's go. No use anyway without tickets. Follow me after I'm around the corner. Cover their mouth and nose. -Watch yourself. -Is it chloroform? -German or English? -German. Great. For our late guests, we've set up a fast check-in. -You'll get on board quicker. -Fast check-in? Would you come with me? Come with me. Follow me, or the ship will sail without you. Nik - Take the damn suitcase. Quick, quick. We're closing. Open the suitcase. Not that one. The other one. That's right. My daughter painted it. She's five. My daughter's four. She can do houses and trees. Let's go. I'll never do a handover on a cruise ship again. Police. Yes. Two were attacked on the dock. That sounds good. Did you already inform the ship? No? Then I'll do it. I'll call security right away. Lock it. And? The corridors are really long. Sun loungers on deck, but they're reserved with towels. What else? I don't know... "Check everything." Soda machine at the end of the corridor. What about ventilation systems? Exits? Christian and Sabine, 62 and 54, from Bensheim live next door. Dentist and dental assistant. -Nik, how did you? -Nils. -How did you find that out? - I just knocked and asked. -Knocked? -Yeah. Anything else I can do for you? WE GOT A TIP. THIS COULD BE HIM. BUT BE CAREFUL. COPS ON BOARD. Hey, how did Charly come to hire you? My mother's cousin. Mate, I'm so happy this all worked out. Don't draw attention to yourself. Sure. Shit. My guy's a pervert. Mine too. You're here after all. What a surprise. We thought you weren't coming. I'm Helen Caracas, the cruise manager. And you're... Tarek Amadi and Alexander Stauff, correct? -Yes. -Very good. Ticked. Ticked. Who's who? Well, I'm... Alexander. So you're David Bowie? -And you're Elvis? -Right. Stars without makeup always look like shit too. -Here are... God, did you hurt yourself? -Just a scratch. Thank goodness. Here are the timetables. You're off tonight. Tomorrow at 10:30 a.m., photo wall shoot, deck 4. 4 p.m., photo wall, deck 1. The first show is on the 23rd at 10 p.m. Hall 3. After that, twice daily at 6 and 10 p.m. Mingle with the crowd after the show. General rule, make the people happy, especially the ladies. [ Will. Our pianist Mia will drop by soon. She'll show you around. Have a nice time. And don't get seasick. Fuck. And now? Call in sick, or what? Both sick for two weeks? Forget it. They'll never buy it. There'll be enquiries, complaints. Then... Shit! Hide? It's just a little cruise show. It can't be that hard. No one's paying attention. Are you nuts? No. I won't do it. I won't. Whenever something's at stake in my life something always comes along and fucks it up. If those pseudo-art arseholes, those... snobby critics, gallerists... Those fucking Nazis. If they hadn't needed a scapegoat back then... I would've been one of the most relevant artists today. Internationally. Shit. So, let's go see the main hall. -Everything okay? -Maybe a bit seasick. Ouch. Always focus on the horizon. -What are you guys doing again? -We're David Bowie and Elvis. No, really? You look more like Harold and Maude. You look like what's her name, that annoying blonde. Heidi Klum? No... The other one. So that's how it is. Should I arrest you now or should we cruise a bit? -I don't understand. -Be a good girl, Martha. I was on my way to security anyway. Join me. You won't get away this time. Let's see what I can do for you if the painting is handed over freely. -Wow. -You're welcome. Right. It's nicer being together here. Approaching one another. Doing things together. We create connections. No one here has to be alone. And with that in mind, to us. To a nice swig. And bon voyage. To your health! Now the most important place. The bar. You can only get through a cruise like this with enough alcohol. -Three beers, please. -My pleasure. Shouldn't we finish the tour, then we can... Oh, I'll show you the dressing room. But it's first come, first serve. -Here you are. -Thank you. I'm a huge Bowie fan. Oh, right. No, I'm Elvis. You're Bowie? Which phase? The late phase. Although the early phase was good too. Right. I love Ziggy Stardust the most. Yes, I love him too. He was just so unbelievably progressive. Which one? Bowie. He died much too soon. The virus carried him off. What virus? AIDS. No, he died of cancer. -What do you mean? He was gay. -No, he wasn't. Levi. A good friend of mine. Just a sec. Do you have a clue about anything? To your health. And yours. -Hello! -Levi. -Cheers. -How was your summer? Like a barbecue, and yours? This is so stupid. Bored and drunk, on a fast track to their own demise. I think it's pretty great. Take a right up there. It's hard to put lipstick on in this weather! Do your job, Bernhard. I've been doing this job for 25 years. And nothing's ever happened. In the last ten years, 17 passengers have gone missing. That's not quite right. The last two turned up in Newfoundland. -Dead and washed ashore. -Well... "Missing” can't really be used in this context. I mean... What's up with you? I can't do this anymore. Now one of the ventriloquists has a stomach bug. A search bulletin came in today. A painting worth 60 million was stolen in Frankfurt. -A black square. - I would’ve stolen something nicer. Who cares, when it's worth 60 million? CONTACT SECURITY ON BOARD. IF THE SUSPECTS APPEAR, OUR GUYS CAN HELP FROM THE WATER. BAD RECEPTION HERE. TEXT FOR NOW. UNEVENTFUL SO FAR. I'll BE IN TOUCH. GALLERY MESSAGE IT'S FUN WORKING LIKE THIS :-) You have to stop sweating, or it won't work. You're breathing on me. -You're so close! -Then do it yourself. I don't paint anymore. I haven't picked up a brush in 30 years. Why waste my time being like those fucking art arseholes? It's undignified. -Shit. It burns. -Good gracious! This costume fabric breathes like a tyre. Your eye looks really sore. -Should I go fetch you something? -No. I've gotten through serious shit in my time. In 2003 I had a job in a museum in Barcelona. The blueprints were off. Crawled through ventilation shafts for four days. What do we have here? The ultimate souvenir photo with David Bowie and Elvis. Sabine, this will be fun! -Come on, Werner. Take a picture. -No. -Yes. Come on. -Not again. We have to have a picture. No way those two are look-alikes. Weird, huh? And? -Oh, no. -What is it? Can we take one without him? -Let's take one with him. -Wow. Let's put him in the middle. That Bowie is nasty, at any rate. But Elvis is sweet. -Have a nice evening. -You too. Are you a clown? What's this? Huh? Oh, those. Gambled them off that Hitler guy in the dressing room. Hitler? Yeah. Some kind of Hitler show. Really sick. Did he happen to have a cane and bowler hat? Yeah. Cut out the stealing. Total risk, you're drawing attention. Sorry, I can't help it. It's in the genes. Listen, mate. I'm well-trained. I'll whack you if I like. Look at these babies. I can still do 60 centimetres until today. Don't believe me? Okay. Can you get us coffee? It's so beautiful. Like a painting. -Maybe they're spies. -What? Who? Elvis and Bowie. Are you still thinking about those two? Wait. -Did you come already? -Oh, you weren't finished? I need water. Maybe they pose as long-lost relatives. With all these grannies here on board. They're just bad look-alikes. It wouldn't be the first time. Remember two years ago? That Michael Jackson. 68-year-old fatso from Darmstadt. Too funny. No, they're up to something else. And this here... will help us answer the question. A card for cabin 7308. Are you mad? That's illegal. Andi, one of the receptionists, is a friend. I told him it was for a surprise party. Even with Andi? -Have you gone completely crazy? -We're going in there. Why? Those guys are harmless. We're going to find out. I don't think they are. Mia. -Mia. -Yeah. This may be a strange question, but honestly... How am I in bed? You want an honest answer? No. Come on, let's go. Get out of bed. Levi! Let's check it out. It's so embarrassing they hired those guys. It's so unprofessional here. Idiots. Fuckwits. If they keep gaping at me I'll saw those arseholes in half. Well, then. ...I can't do... I can't do it. You have to. We'll pull through. Ladies and gentlemen, you can look forward to a grand artist who's much better than the original. -David Bowie, alias Mr. David B! -Good luck. Well, then. What are you doing? Nothing... -One last look. -Shit. I'm leaving. Hal! Is it a tough audience? Don't fuck it up for once. And? That was easy. SPECTACULAR ART THEFT: "THE BLACK SQUARE" STOLEN That one's really good as Elvis. I've been an Elvis fan ever since I was a kid. Drink your nightcap, gramps, and off to bed. Unbelievable. We'll see who has to go to bed. David Bowie. Poor man's version. Your stage presence is unique in a truly special way. -Really? -Yes. Your show reminded me of a performance I once saw. "Genital Panic". It was all about... Sorry. I'm boring you. I used to work in art galleries. So I tend to fall into artspeak. Are you interested in art? Some of it. Some of it? Yes. I find a lot of it dishonest. Even malicious. Just think of Durer. Godfather of art Nazis. Puts nature on his canvas and Kills it. -It's horrible. Artistic destruction. -Yes. Let's drink to what art should be. Another one? The woman is unbelievable. -She finds Pollock kitsch. -They really liked me! What was that? I've never seen anything like it. So bad it was almost good. This will have consequences. I'll think of something. Extra shifts for you to compensate for this outrage, my friend. -Good job. -Thank you very much. That song's so uninspired. No one told me it had to be better than the original. -Shit. -Yeah, really. I thought you were really good. I hope we'll be done with this soon. It's all so unprofessional. There's that legal finder's reward of 3%. At 60 million, that would be... Loads of money. -Nearly 5 million. -Exactly. What do you think Ernie and Bert are getting? They're not going to say, "Oh, the picture's gone. Let's have a cruise." I like the little one. I don't think they're dangerous. The old man is pathetic. -And those are the worst! -Oh, please. Shit! -This isn't good. -A drink? Are you sure? This has never happened to me. -I've always worked alone up to now. -Say... -Where is it? -No idea. Sorry. After "Get Rich or Try Dying" 50 Cent bought a 500 SLK for his Mum. What a twit. I bought one for my mom too. On credit! I need the dosh. That fucking painting! How can you be so... Just sell it again. CHARLY CALLING It could be a trap. I can imitate your voice. Why? I'll answer it. Disguise my voice. Hello? Hey, Charly. Oh, not too bad. And you? Listen... Where were you on Friday? Traffic jam. Bit unprofessional. I mean, we were sitting there, waiting... Of course. We did. When? Regarding Friday, we really have to... Okay, okay. Bye. That arsehole. "Traffic jam". When I see him, [I'll... What did he want? The handover for the painting is tomorrow. 10 p.m. Cabin 9633. One of Charly's guys will pick us up with a boat at midnight. Tomorrow? Do you want me to do it? You want to forge a Malevich? You two-bit thief. It's too white, of course. Much too white. Could you please turn around? Otherwise I can't do it. Oh, that's how you do it. It'll never work. Just another nuance. No, it's getting too yellow! Damn! Oh, shit. Shit. This is just as unpleasant for me as for you. Once I start, I can't stop. The picture was hidden for a long time in the Hermitage. So the people couldn't see it. Once a comrade wanted to see it. He asked a functionary why the painting was stashed away. If it were hung next to key socialist artworks, the people would understand that the work was ridiculous. The functionary told the comrade he was wrong. He said the people wouldn't understand the Black Square, but it would see that there was something else than society and the state. Art as an alternative to authority. That's what makes the Black Square so special. This is dangerous. The Black Square is a confession to grief for me, an invitation to protest. I think it stinks and we shouldn't do it. Hello? -Detention with Levi! -Oh. Our gentleman host. What's your suit size? We'll find something. Please be on time. Arsehole. DEAR LEVI, LOVE, TRUST AND HAPPINESS DON'T COME CLOSE TO WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU. "Now I know why I eat, drink... and breathe." Here you are. Have a lovely time. Here you are. Have a lovely time. My name is Levi Stauder, first gentleman host of the ship. -I'm Alex. -Hello. -Here you are. -Have a nice evening. I'm supposed to hand out flowers. Aha. You'll need me. Can you dance? Hello. May I ask you to dance? "Make the ladies happy with a dance." Our motto. I'm a bit short on time at the moment. There's an airflow here, by the way. To dry your sweat after dancing. There he is. David Bowie. Shall we? Off we go. Maybe I should lead? No. But you're not doing anything. At the right moment I will. Just a moment. You can't even dance! Hey, there. -And where do you live? -Frankfurt. Frankfurt? Frankfurt/Oder or Frankfurt/Main? -Where the money lives. -Where the money lives? We're quite thirsty in Frankfurt. I'd like another, please. Two more, please. Two. Hey, Elvis. - I heard you were really good. -Hi. Uh... -Really? -Yeah. I'm playing later too. You should drop by. -Okay. -Good. If you don't find me... I'll give you my number. See you later. Martha. Would you like to dance or are you guarding the stairs? I... am looking for the airflow. Supposed to be here somewhere. -Do you want to lead? -In a minute. Otherwise, I could also do it. If you like. Tell me, Martha... If you're interested in the two of us... Well, I... -I'd really like to paint you. -Paint? I'm not just a one-night nude. No, of course not. That's not what I meant... What's your room number? 7308. Good, then I'll see you later. Wrong side. Vincent, the door won't open. -You have to sleep somewhere else. -What? Come in. -You have to sleep somewhere else. -What? Why? I feel like painting again. A lady visitor. Lady visitor? All that love waits for is opportunity. What? Cervantes. Cervantes... Cervantes? A risk is what it is. Just when you need an Adorno or a Camus, there's none to be found. You risk drawing attention to yourself. You can't be serious. You owe me one. Hey, Mia. Guess who? The basic step is already good, isn't it? And... after the basic step... a turn. Just like that. Very good. Fuck. Why would he steal that? He's a kleptomaniac. If you want to know what I think... Look. I told you about this. SPECTACULAR ART THEFT: "THE BLACK SQUARE" STOLEN Fuck. That's ridiculous. Fuck. That would be unbelievable. We should investigate him. - I don't want any stress here, police... -Helen. I'm a pro. Shit! That's never happened before. It doesn't matter. It's really the first time. -And... -I'm afraid... We'll have to wait a bit. Takes a while. Well... We need strong works of art. Precise. Unfathomable forever. Yes. Only idiots believe art should be veracious. Art... involves truth, not veracity. Listen, I think... None of this is a good idea. I'm sorry. Bye Elvis. How was it with the woman? Great. Really? Yes, my God. Why are you wearing the Elvis outfit? No one ever painted me before. If you like. Not so contrived. More to the front. Cross your legs. Look off into the distance. And a hint of a smile. What? My what? My picture? My picture? Where's my picture? Oh, it's yours? You want your picture? Come on. Come over here and get your picture! Jesus and Maria. Hello there. -Are you okay? -Yep, everything's fine. I got to know Elvis better. Aha. Right. And? Did you fool around? Oh, right. No. -Definitely not. -Oh, God. He's a really good kisser. Have you gone completely mad? They're criminals. -Criminals. -Yeah, man. Something exciting. What if they notice something? That's... -Oh, my God. -Where's the suitcase? I hid it. For your protection. -What? -So you aren't incriminated. Are you stupid? Me, stupid? After what you told me, I'm stupid? -Yes. -Aha. I'm stupid. I have news too, incidentally. I have good reason to believe that several people on this ship are involved in all this. Why? Who? An old lady in the ballroom with sunglasses... was staring at me. -And? -Well... Staring in a knowing manner. A knowing manner! What does that mean? How do you stare knowingly? You sense it... When you see it you know it. -They all sit around staring here! -Not this way. Not this way. Where is the picture, you dick? Mia, it's for your sake, really. Just because you're a woman... you think you can bear torture better? Yep. Exactly. -Good evening. Here you are. -Thank you. Elvis. They're even painting themselves... Bernhard. It's gruesome. -Maybe they're dangerous or really sick. -Don't worry. If that's true, we'll be famous, you and. Saviours... of the Malevich. Nonsense. Thank you. Sorry. Somehow it's really cool. Whoever sends flowers anonymously is older than 50 and weighs more than 80. How moronic can you be? -Can I see my portrait? -No way. It's not finished yet. Let's see how the other baby is. It must be dry by now. How can this be? They steal like pirates here. Honestly, after the trip I'm writing a complaint to the tour operator. Everything gets taken here! It's not okay. It's simply not okay. The nerve! We need to leave a really bad rating online. Definitely. -Not cool. -And say everything gets stolen. Something might go missing once. But twice? Something's wrong. Just steal another square picture. I'll start mixing the colours. The nerve! -60 million. -Mind-boggling. Yes. If we hand them over to the police with the painting, we won't get anything. -But we have to. -Why? It's worth a try, right? I think we should report it to the police. -Maybe we'll get a reward. -Reward? Even if we do, the cruise line will get the reward if we do it officially. Bernhard. Once in a lifetime. Shit. Just a sip... I'm better at writing it down. Thanks. Well, that's... lovely. -How sweet of you. -Really? So you feel it too? Well, I... You feel it! No. No. I only feel it... partially. We should just toss all this aside. - I think the ship's nice... -Yes? Nice? I think it's nice too. We could start out afresh together. Some place really nice. I have something that could bring us a lot of money. It's perhaps just a bit... -...sudden. -Yes. -Just a moment. -Yeah. It smells like urine. A chimp could have painted it, but it's worth 60 million. Huh. -Where did it... -60 million. -How did you... -I found it. -How? -It wasn't hidden very well. I'll do it alone. Always do a handover alone in case it goes wrong. Hey. Good luck. I hope they don't kill you. I don't think they will. MANHUNT FOR ART THIEVES Fuck. Please put the picture on the table. -Not really a surprise, huh? -Unpack it. He's saying this picture is better than gold. It will be eternally valuable. When the last thing on earth disappears, humanity will feel the need to be perceived as meaningful. Any construction worker can buy gold. But art is the currency of the top 10,000. It's the best investment for him. And in just ten years, it will be worth 30% more. And the... the... -The prudery... -What? Prudery? -What? -Prudery? I'm not fluent. It doesn't matter. Everything he owns he worked for with his own hands, and he slaved away... And... now I've lost my train of thought. Ask him if he knows the symbolic value of this painting. What it stands for. What it stands for in Russia. This painting is a sensation. Malevich played an important role in freeing art from the burden of the objective world. This isn't just a picture, it's... the experience of pure abstraction. You're sacrificing Malevich for a guy like that. You are too. Charly's guy on the boat will be here in 15 minutes. -They're after me. -Bullshit. They are. It's everywhere. I'm on television. There are surveillance images of me with the suitcase. -Oh, shit. -Oh, shit. But that doesn't matter for a master of disappearance. Last time I disappeared so well, no one noticed when I showed up again. In five minutes. I can't do it. I can't do it. -I -What? I want to stay here. Put the fucking life vest on. What kind of shit are you talking? I'm not like you! I can't just disappear! I can't! What is this bullshit? If I leave this ship, everything's over for me. You don't have a choice! Yes, I do! I'll find the Black Square and make everything right again. Vincent. I won't let the Malevich go under. There's a way to get you out of all this. Without me you won't find the painting, and we need it. What about you? I've done other things before. I want to paint again. Going underground's the best place to do it. I thought about your wanted photo. It gave me an idea. There must be tons of surveillance cameras here. It doesn't sound good. They're Russians. It's a fight for true love. Half deck 8, yes. I'm on my way. Stress with Russians. Just what I needed. "A fight for true love"? You call next time. SEARCH THE ARCHIVE BY TIME 127 RESULTS Oh, man. He's a Peeping Tom. Oh, God! Your girl's in on it too. Good evening. Now's not a good time. Give it back to me. -Give what back? -The Malevich. -Who? -The picture. I don't know what... Oh, fuck. Man, it was just... -It was just a joke. -Just give it to me. -I can't. -Cut the crap. I swear. I can't. I want to give it back. No messing around. Mia, please. That dimwit Levi hid it. He's lost it completely. I really don't know where it is. I'm really sorry. Where's the painting? -Which painting? -Where is it? -Are you out of your minds? -What? What? Helen has the picture, I swear. Helen has it. Helen? Nils! Psst! Are you breaking in here? I'm investigating... a case. Should we... Or if you're just about to leave, we'd... What you're doing right now... is unlawful entry. Well, we... We happened to come in because the door was open. In the name of the ship... What's going on? Well, you see, we... My hair! Have you gone mad? Good night. Thanks. Look for the painting. I'll try to find my nipple. It'll grow back again anyway. Hey! Hey! Cool. Here. It smells like piss. Smells like piss. Why does it smell like... -Where's the original? -No idea. -I've never seen it before. -Stop lying. You know that you've committed a criminal offence, right? -We just want to give the original back. -Likely story. But then we'll all go to jail! -We don't have another one. -She's being honest, for once. We were going to give this one to the authorities. -What's gotten into you? -Nothing. Pull yourself together. We can get through this together. -"Together". -Yes. You mean, you and Levi. -You're despicable. -You can't be serious. Still thinking about us? That was in 1993. Drunk and seasick to boot. -You were so pretty. -We didn't even sleep with one another. Tell me that isn't true. Tell me that isn't true! -Disgusting. -Wonderful. The gigolo definitely has the suitcase. He really took us for a ride. Not too bad, really. -As a bodyguard. 500 euros. -What? 500 euros! -Personal protection till we arrive. -Per day? -"Per day"? I don't have any more. -From tomorrow. I have him. What? Oh, no. Shit. What do I do with him? We'll sort it. Shit. Shit, shit! Arsehole. It's in my front pocket. An extra key for the cuffs. So? You could reach it. -How? -Well... With your tongue. What? With my tongue? In your pocket with my tongue? -No way. -Oh, well. -Left or right? -Right. -Where's the painting? - I already told you. You're lying. Last chance. Are you completely insane? Wait, how did he... He's in here. Mia, what are you doing here? -Can you do the robodance? -A bit. We can try. -How did you do that? - I don't know. -Where's my painting? -I told you. Helen has it! -Helen has my fake. -What? I've got him! No! No, no, no! -No... No! -I've got him! So where is it? Where is it? Just tell them. Then nothing will happen. So? So? I've said it so often. I won't say it again. Okay. Alex. Alex? Okay. -Where did she take it? -From my cabin. Your cabin? That isn't... Oh! How? What? Oh, then... That means it's still in my hiding place. In the dressing room, behind the radiator. It was just a misunderstanding. -My pistol is pointed at your balls. -I'm least vulnerable there. Give me the painting and the bag, Vincent. So this is it then... I'll take care of the Malevich. Everything will be fine. Come on. Oh, my God! Stay right there! Enough is enough! We need to de-escalate... Bernhard! -All right. I'll do it. -Just be careful! -Is she still inside? -I have no idea. I hope she hasn't fled too. Let's go, men! Thank you, thank you! And now applause for our wonderful Elvis! Come on, boy. Now 18 passengers have gone missing. But no matter. -It's our little secret. -With all the pollution in the sea, I don't have a good feeling about it. Such a big box... I love you. I know. THREE WEEKS LATER... Do you think it smells like urine? Strange. No Limits Media 2020 Subtitles: T. Dennie et al.
