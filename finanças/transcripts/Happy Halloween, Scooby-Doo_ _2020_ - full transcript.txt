Guys, we're here to prove that there is no monster. And P.S., we have a flawless track record. [Shaggy] You don't understand, Velma. I'm like the boy who cried wolf. I keep warning you, but like, you won't believe me until I finally get eaten. I don't think you guys were listening when I told you that story. Point is, being afraid is a waste of time.

Or should we call you... [grunts] Regular Scarecrow? Whoa. I guess you should. Aren't you sweaty in there? Not just any scarecrow, but the Scarecrow. AKA Dr. Jonathan Crane, former professor of psychology in Gotham City turned supervillain. And recently, an escapee from Arkham Asylum. [whistles] Nice work. That's a mighty big fish you kids trapped there. It wasn't a trap. It was an app. They're totally different things. Still. This one's wanted for crimes all over the East Coast. I can already feel the paperwork burrowing into my skull. Any last words before the law throws a book on you? "I would've..." Come on, say it with me... "I would've gotten away with it too if... If it hadn't been..." Oh, but I am getting away with it. - Drones. - A dead man's switch. You shut down the signal I use to control my gas grenade drones, but that same signal is the only thing that stops my friends here from plunging this entire town into 76 hours of unmitigated terror. And so the fate of Crystal Cove was left in the capable hands of the Avocado Toast Generation. - I... I gotta let him go. - [Velma] Wait! [gasps] [gasps] [Shaggy yelling] [Shaggy continues yelling] Shaggy. Shaggy, it's over. You got them all. I know. I'm just rewarding us for a job well done. [gulps] - Ralvsies? - Ralvsies? Rabsolutely. [both laugh] [annoyed groan] - [people cheering] - Special thanks to Mystery Incorporated, for proving once again that most creeps are just regular guys with bad gas and worse ideas. - [all cheering] - [laughter] - All right. Let's see some dancing up in here. - [upbeat music playing] Elvira's Halloween Highway of Horror Parade is back on. - [siren wails] - [music stops] Um, no, sorry. That's not true. This is, uh, this is sort of a federal crime scene now. This isn't possible. I was in hiding until you meddling young adults came along. How could you have known where to find me? We're Mystery Incorporated. This is who we are. This is what we do. - Word. - Okay. We've always solved mysteries and we always will. Nothing but net! Frankly, taking you down was easy. [Daphne] Basic. I found traces of an unknown substance on a piece of fan mail sent to Elvira. Analysis confirmed it to be residue from a toxic gas derived from the Tibetan Blue Poppy, the signature weapon of the 53rd most infamous supervillain in the world. How about a little sick burn, Scarecrow? From there, we assumed you'd strike during the parade and tracked your gas leak with an air quality meter. I wrote the app to counter the signal used to control your gas grenades myself. Womp womp. Just one problem. I only steal Toe Omni-Tech gear. It doesn't leak. - [siren blares] - [vehicle doors open] Get him in the truck. I'm not afraid of you, Crane. Fear is an illogical reaction to an imagined threat. Fearless, then. Intelligent. Proud and stubborn. You remind me very much of the one person in this world I care about. For that reason, I'll do you one favor and tell you... that while I might be the one in chains, I believe we are both caught in the same trap. - It was an app. - Wait. What's that supposed to mean? [door slams] [grunts] Guys. She's gonna be okay. She told me. [door creaks] Guys. Check this out. My arms aren't shaking. And I feel super weird. Like my heart's beating in slow motion. Yeah. Me too. [both] Internet medical site. No! You guys just have a temporary case of "not being scared." Probably because we finished our Halloween mystery before dinner. Well, then, like, what are we waiting for? We should be celebrating. [giggling] Scooby-Doo, old buddy, we need to be trick-or-treating right now while the trick-or-treating is hot! - Trick-or-treating? - Aren't you two too old for trick-or-treating? No. Oh! Shoot, though... We don't have costumes. I would need the perfect costume. We didn't think we'd need costumes. Last year we were up past midnight chasing the ghosts of The Three Stooges. [mimicking The Three Stooges] [objects clattering] Like, necessity is the mother of invention. All we need to do is chew up some candy like so. And we chew it to produce a sticky resin, thusly. - [humming] - [groans in disgust] Sprinkle some happy little wrapped candies, and top it off with a couple of buckets. And boom. We're, like, spilled Halloween candy. [ethereal music playing] Oh, my. But sort of brilliant. If you already had all that candy, why do you want to trick-or-treat? This is, like, our seed candy, Daph. You gotta have candy to make candy. Like, we'll meet you at the Corn Maze. [chuckling] Scoob. We did it. This is the mother lode. [laughs raucously] Scooby Snacks. This totally makes all the itchiness from the candy drying on our skin worth it. [both] Phew. [distant whirring] [both] Hmm? [both gulp] [gasps] It's like one of those drones we shot down. Bleh. [Shaggy] "Tot-alli Frame." [chuckles] Totalli Frame, man! [gasps] Scoob, those pumpkins are, like, drinking up a mixture of toxic waste and concentrated fear gas. Like, we need to get these Scooby Snacks as far away from here as possible. [grunts in agreement] [sinister laughter] I think we need to get us out of here, too. [sinister laughter] [shivering] [grunts] Giddy up, Scoob! Oh, no. You giddy up. - No. You giddy up. - No. You giddy up. - You giddy up. - No. You giddy up. - [rumbling] - [cackling] [growls] Okay, we both giddy up. Double giddy up, on the double. [roars] [both yell, grunt] [both gasp] [Shaggy] Run, Scoob. [panting] - [cackling] - [yelling] - [yells] - Huh. [laughing] [both laugh] - [howling] - [both gasp] Oh. Run. Run! - [all laughing] - [Sheriff clears throat] Ever since you kids unmasked the Trash Monster of Scranton, it's me who's been warning you not to mess with law enforcement. I want you kids to remember that whatever happens next, you brought this on yourselves. But we caught the villain. You're in over your heads on this one. Just go home and leave it to the pros. [whistles] Jeepers. I hope we did the right thing. Of course we did. [chuckles] Thank you for saving Crystal Cove. Happy Halloween, pardners. Oh, my gosh. Thank you? Oh, little girl, you don't have to do that. It's cool. She wanted to do it, so I told her it was okay. Aw, well, thank you both. No problem. I'm Mike. This little cowpoke is Michelle. You guys really did save the town. You ever need anything, just ask. Maybe I'll buy y'all a caramel corn later on. Hey, nerds. Oh, you all turned around? Wow. Well, it turns out these reporters want to interview you for capturing the Scarecrow instead of me for being the hottest Grand Marshal this side of the River Styx. No accounting for taste. Who? Us? On TV? [laughs] This could be big, guys. This could be our moment. [reporters clamoring] Please. One question at a time. Victoria Hasselbaum from Newsy McNews Face News. Is this all of you? I was told there were five. I see less than five. Scooby and Shaggy were right here. They're always nearby. Just usually hiding. - [both panting] - Those are the ones. Toxic waste and fear gas combo. Like dogs, but pumpkins. They're pumpkins. They were like jackals, only they were like Jack-O'-Lanterns. Jackal Lanterns. [whimpering] Only terrifying. And they're coming this way. You gotta believe us, man. Have you caught sight of these Jackal Lanterns? I never heard... Uh... This is Shaggy and Scooby. They're, um... really into the Halloween spirit. This isn't cosplay, Velma. Halloween's turned upside down and inside out. The pumpkins are trying to eat the people. We need to go somewhere to hide. They're perfectly sane. From a certain point of view. They're... they're just wired up on candy, I think. Excuse me. Excuse me. But does that young man have an owl stuck to his butt? - [owl hoots] - Who? Oh, my gosh. They mean you, Mr. Owl. Okay, tell... tell you what. Let's do this a little more formally somewhere else. It's been a crazy night and... Velma. This is real. I'm crying wolf here. You have to believe me. No, I don't! You guys are a mess. You've eaten way too much candy, we've already solved the mystery, and you're talking nonsense. You guys locked yourselves in the Mystery Machine instead of helping. Maybe you can just skip this part too. - [hooting] - [yelling] Just... [sighs] Go get cleaned up. But, Velma... [grunting] Come on, let's de-owl you. [Daphne] ♪ From the shores Of the chocolate fountain ♪ ♪ To the peak of the rock Candy mountain ♪ ♪ I've been seeking trick-or-treating for your love ♪ ♪ Well, when it's time To wash an owl ♪ ♪ And you wish that you had a towel ♪ ♪ But you don't have a towel ♪ ♪ So you got to use Your sweater ♪ [scatting] [groaning] Hmm... [groaning] Ah... [chitters] [Daphne] Oh, what a cute little baby. Oh, you're just such a cute little owl. Ah, who's cute? You are. [hooting] - Man, what a... [screaming] - [hooting] What a night. If you guys are cool here, I've got this amazing plan to score the perfect costume. All I have to... - No, we are not cool here. - Uh-uh. Did nobody hear what we said about toxic flying monster pumpkins? Jackal Lanterns? We've fought some dumb monsters, guys, but that's just dumb. Well, I'm not making it up, so it's reality that's dumb. Why you gotta be like that, reality? Well, you said these things were right on your tail, so where are they now? What if these things turn into monsters too? Help me out, Scoob. We need to, like, squash every squash that we see. [both grunting] [Velma] I mean, we've been doing this forever. Since we got a pup named Scooby-Doo. Anyway, we make a heck of a team. There is no "I" in Mystery Incorporated. Except for the obvious one. [Velma] Thank you. They're gonna have to tow the old girl to the body shop, and the bill ain't pretty. I figure maybe we can get dishwashing jobs to earn money. [phone ringing] [Velma] It's Bill Nye. Now, that Bill is pretty. Velma, Fred. Hey, I was just watching the news and I saw you guys. I just wanted to call and say congratulations. Thanks, Mr. Nye. Hey, no problem. But this isn't that sort of "thank you." I got you something. [engine whirring] - An air drop? - Before the mic drop. [loud thud] [tires screech] [both] What is that? [Nye] It gives me great pleasure to introduce the future of mystery solving... The Mystery Machine X. Whoa. Electric. Massive touchscreen. An autoclave. This thing has it all. Except a soul. Hello, Mystery Incorporated. Welcome to the Mystery Machine X. Where can I take you on this invigorating Halloween night? Whoa. And you made the nav computer look like you. Better. This actually is me. I'm just talking to you through the vehicle now. I'm chillin' at home tonight handing out candy to trick-or-treaters, but I do have a costume. You're sitting in it. I'm like a nav computer, a science resource, and a friend, all wrapped up in one convenient package. Being a hologram is highly entertaining. Hang on, Nye Riders. [both gasp] So you're going to... what? Ride around and solve mysteries with us? Why not? It sounds like fun. What about when trick-or-treaters show up? Or if you have to go to the bathroom? Well, there's a real computer inside this thing too, although it's not as charming as I am. Just press the "Bill me now" button to summon me and "Bill me later" to switch to autopilot. Wow. This is so generous, Mr. Nye. Thank you. Fred, we don't have to worry about fixing the Mystery Machine anymore. This night just keeps on giving. The Mystery Machine doesn't need fixing. She said she's gonna be fine. [screaming] - [Fred] What happened? - It's... it's Victoria Hasselbaum from Newsy McNews Face News. Something... The pumpkins. They just came alive and took her. Took her where? [straining] Hank, can you unhitch this thing from my car? I mean, I don't want to have to pay double toll on the highway. [Daphne] Elvira. Oh. Hey, girl. I just wanted to say that I love your look. Gaultier? Oh, Gezundheit. Same with my scarf. Have you ever considered mentoring anyone? One of me is more than enough. Or so the legends say. [chuckles] I don't want to be you, silly. Just to look and think like you, but still have free will. Have you ever done circus work? You know? Like, getting shot out of a cannon, wrestling a bear, breathing fire... Not officially for a circus, no. All right. You're in. Yes! But remember, you're getting an education, not a job. First thing you need to know is how I like my luggage packed into my car. [cackling] [tired grunting] [both panting] Maybe Daph was right. Maybe we imagined the whole thing. - You think so? - I don't know. Maybe. I mean, if they were real, then where did they go? [cackles] Like, zoinks! Oh! Help, Scoob. I've got a pumpkin butt. - Hello? Miss Hasselbaum? - It's Mystery Incorporated. We come in peace. [cackling] - Uh-oh. - This is what Shaggy and Scooby were talking about. Is this even possible? - [rustling] - Huh? [straining, mumbling] Miss Hasselbaum. It's me, Fred. - We're here to rescue you. - [thudding] [grunts] [Victoria] My glasses. - I can't see without my glasses. - [snarling] [screams] I didn't want to see that. Oh, no. Victoria Hasselbaum. [burps] [cackles] This isn't happening. [snarls] [roaring] [Fred] Run! Fred. This is so dumb. It's the dumbest monster ever. It can't be real. Oh, I believe you, Velma. [roaring] I just don't think my legs do. - [cackles] - Oh! [grunting] [cackling] Wow. You're a regular Mary Sue. Daphne. Now step on it, Elvira! [straining] I'm trying. Parade's back on. Oh, no. They got Hank. They zombified him, only they pumpkified him. [slurps, snarls] [distant snarling] - [both sigh] - [electricity crackling] They turned the power off. How could they turn the power off? They're vegetables. [both panting] [roaring] It's, like, the Alpha Jackal Lantern. [both screaming] [motor whirring] Halloween. One more thing I don't like about that big orange guy. He cheats! Well, if you can't beat 'em... [grunting] [both] Phew. Yeah. [people screaming] It begs the question, is this a natural occurrence, or perhaps another problem caused by the so-called "Information Superhighway"? [screams] Guys, over here. Come on. [roaring] [honking horn playing funeral march] [mimicking honking horn] [tires screech] [Elvira] Coming through. [both sigh] [rumbling] [both gasp] Mike. Hey, Mike. We need your help. Remember me? I'm Fred, from Mystery Incorporated. Yeah, now's not a great time, man. It's just that Michelle said we saved the town, and you said you owed us one because we saved the town. Our friends need a ride. I said caramel corn. Fine. Get in the back. Come on. [terrified gasp] Mr. Nye, get us out of here. Ludicrous speed. Engage. - Huh? [gasps] - Whoa. You know what's terrifying? It's so messed up, I'm not even hungry. Y'all cowpokes want some of this here licorice? [both] Yes, please. Wow. You guys are having a wild Halloween. If I weren't virtually right here, I'd be jealous. Pumpkins that were mutated by toxic chemicals and can bite people and turn them into other pumpkins. In what world does that make sense? [gasps] She's still back there. My love. No, Daphne made it out with Elvira. They're right up ahead. No. No. The Mystery Machine. We left her back there all alone. It's okay, Freddy. We got the X now, and it's got way more tech than the old one had. We're gonna crack this mystery like a gourd. [purring] Ah, what a hideous night for a drive. Ah, so hideous. - Is everyone okay? - [Shaggy] Like, no. Heck no. Look, I don't even live out this way. It's been a crazy night, we're all tired, and these guys smell like the bottom of a trash can in a candy store. And I kind of have to go. And my little girl kind of has to go. Sorry, Mike. Let's pull over at the next exit and we'll sort it all out. We already solved the Scarecrow mystery. I can't believe that this... event is a coincidence. It's not. You saw what the toxic waste and the fear gas did to that pumpkin patch. Did I? What do you think, Mr. Nye? Do you have any science-based wisdom to impart? Well, Velma, if you stacked every ruler on Earth, end-to-end between the Earth and the Moon, they would all drift away before you could measure anything at all. Okay, yeah. I mean science wisdom that applies to our current situation. Oh. Well, no, then. Nothing yet. No idea on the pumpkins. The town should definitely not have collapsed, though. There are no fault lines in the area. There was talk of underground lithium mining a few years back, but it was shut down over concerns about the impact on the environment. Hmm. Crystal Cove gets its name from the stalactite anthodite crystals in the area's sea caves, but none of those caves extend this far inland. Anthodite crystals are, by the way, my sixth favorite crystal. Daddy's had about enough of Halloween night. Yes, sir. What the... [cackling] [heavy metal music playing] No way. Mr. Nye. More RPMs, please. [both] Whoa. Hey, I thought we were stopping. Speed up. Go, go, go. Really? It's a parade float. Um... Mentee of the Dark. Yes, Mentor of the Dark. I don't suppose you've ever disconnected a parade float from a car going eighty miles per hour before, have you? Um, of course I have. Do you have a cutting torch? Duh. Of course I do. [grunts] Daph, hurry. The Jackal Lanterns are coming in fast. I know what I'm doing, Freddy. [rattling] Do you want me to come over there? I think you're supposed to hold it like... Frederick Herman Jones. Do not torchsplain to me when I am carrying a torch for you. I mean... [grunts] No, yeah. I'm sorry. It's just... - [Daphne grunts] - No. You do you. You do you. - [gasps, grunts] - [tires screech] [chittering, screaming] Whoops. Butterfingers. [metal scraping, clanging] Fire extinguisher? [screams] Ha! The old "hotsy coldsy" trick. Nice. Check this one out. Light 'em up, Mr. Nye. [gasping] [all scream] [laughs] [shudders] [whooping] - Yes. - Yeah. [cackling] They're still coming? Well, at least we bought ourselves some breathing room. [sighs] After all that, I'm starting to wish there was more breathing room in this corset. Ooh, ooh. Can I wear it? Thanks for the assist back there. No problem. But now we need to solve this mystery. The trouble is, we can't slow down to collect clues with those things chasing us. Do we even know they're real pumpkins? Mmm. Stringy. Seedy. Smokey aftertaste. [slurps] - Mmm. - [both] Delicious. Definitely real pumpkins. [chuckles] The fear gas. Maybe we've been exposed to it. Nope. The first thing I did was check the air quality. It's remarkably clear out there. [groans] Velma, are you scared too? Of course not. There's got to be a logical solution to this somewhere in my mind palace. Wow. You live in a palace? No, it's a mind palace. It's a place I can go in my imagination. It's where I keep all of my memories and store the clues for the cases we solve. Eh. That's not as fun. Normally it's a lot of fun. [groans] I just can't seem to find anything in here today. It's because she's scared. Scared? I'm not scared. You sure? Because I can never find what I'm looking for and I'm scared all the time. I'm not scared. You can't be scared of something that isn't real. - But they are real. - Real pumpkin. But not real monsters. Aw. There's no shame in being scared, Velma. Well, good. Because I'm not. Now can everyone be quiet so I can focus on my mind palace? [sighs] Now. What do we know about these Jackal Lanterns? They can turn people into other monster pumpkins, like zombies in the movies. Like, they'll eat your pants right off your butt. Uh-uh. No joke. Right off your butt. They smash real good. We know that chemicals generally don't cause mutations this extreme in nature, so these Jackal Lanterns probably aren't what they appear to be. "Probably"? You're saying there's a chance these things are really monster pumpkins for real? As scientists, we can't discount anything without evidence. Even the seemingly impossible is possible, technically. Man, I thought science was supposed to make people feel better. Nope. Science is a means to get to the truth, and sometimes the truth hurts. [distant cackling] Right now, truth is that I don't know what to make of any of this. [cackling continues] Occam's razor suggests that the solution requiring the least explanation is the best solution. Uh, usually. Oh, great. Pumpkins are tired of getting smashed, and now they want revenge. And we all fell into their trap like hair in a drain. [gasps] A trap. A trap? Shaggy, I could kiss you. - Oh... - [chuckles] Whoa. Like, that escalated fast. Not literally. But you just reminded me. Dr. Crane said that he and I were caught in the same trap. I couldn't figure out what he meant, but... [gasps] Mr. Nye. Step on it. We need to catch up to the Scarecrow. So you're the sheriff in these here parts? - Howdy, Sheriff. - You kids! What are you doing all the way out here? Sheriff, we need to speak to Dr. Crane. Have you completely lost your minds? It's, like, about the Jackal Lanterns. The what? Orange. Freaky. Aggressive drivers. What is that? What's happening? Sheriff, please, we don't have time to explain. And we can't explain. We just need you to patch us through to the truck. Look, Crane isn't my prisoner. He belongs to the Feds. I'm lucky they even let me drive behind. I'm just trying to have a cool sheriff moment here, and... Are those pumpkins driving cars? [cackling] - Please, Sheriff. - What have you done? I gotta call this in. Don't do anything. [fearful babbling] Mr. Nye, can you think of a way I can communicate with Dr. Crane? - Of course, I can. I'll just need to check... - [doorbell ringing] Trick-or-treaters! Hang on one second. Wait, what? Mr. Nye? [children] Trick-or-treat! [Nye] Whoa. All right. Those are some amazing costumes. In real life, in order to exist, of course, Aquaman would probably need gills. Your version is accurate to the source material. But the source material is somewhat unreliable. He's handing out candy. Hey. Let's go see Bill Nye. [siren blaring] Get out of here, son. Leave this to law enforcement. We can help, Sheriff. No. You stay safe. As much as I grumble at you kids, I feel almost like you're the only family I've got. But we've only talked, like, eight or ten times. - [cackling] - [screaming] [Sheriff] The horror. Sheriff! No! Mr. Nye? Hello? [beeping] [automated voice] Engaging autopilot. What are you going to do? [automated voice] Activating seat adjustment. Adjusting seat position to exterior of vehicle. - [beeping] - [Velma] Whoa! Oh, Bill Nye. What have you done? Whoa! You brilliant, lovable man. I'm okay. Speak for yourself. Finally found the flaw in this thing, I guess. [Nye] Well, yes, but the pressure in Atlantis would have to be over 35,000 kilopascal. And that's on top of the social pressures. [growls] You... monsters. [howling] [howling] [giggles] Daddy, this ride is fun. That's right, baby. It's all a 3D motion control ride. - None of it's real. - [cackles] - [grunts] - [engine revving] Daddy just ate too much pizza and fell asleep with the TV on again. It's that pepperoni-Westworld combo. - Velma's got the right idea, Scoob. - [thudding] It's, like, safer in the armored truck. Time to eject. You guys comin'? What? Are you offering me dog treats? Get out of here with that. [pops] [giggling] Pepperoni Westworld. [knocking on door] Happy Halloween, boys. I realize that this isn't normal, but extenuating circumstances. Don't worry. He's behind three inches of reinforced laminate. We'll be right here if you need us. [both breathe deeply] Ms. Dinkley. I didn't expect to see you again so soon. So, you know who I am now, Dr. Crane. I may be the 53rd most infamous supervillain in the world, but I'm still fairly resourceful. [imperceptible] You weren't in Crystal Cove to attack Elvira, were you? What makes you think that? Motive. You don't seem like a crazed fan, and you recently escaped from Arkham Asylum. Why risk your freedom to attack a celebrity at a high-profile event? Need I remind you that I am quite mad? I am also a fan of Elvira. I did write her a fan mail, so technically I am both crazed and a fan. [chuckles] But you are correct. I had no plans to attack Elvira or to do anything tonight other than watch the Halloween parade. You said we were in a trap together. I thought that maybe you were speaking figuratively, but you weren't, were you? Tell me... Are you frightened yet? - No. - [both trembling] You said that fear was an irrational reaction. You are incorrect. Fear is ancient. Primordial. Fear knows the answer before you do, Ms. Dinkley. So, yes. I was speaking figuratively. But we are also both in a very literal trap, as I'm sure you've surmised based on the nature of this unusually desperate little visit. But, dude, who would be out to get the Scarecrow and the Scooby gang? It's true that we do not seem to have anything in common, but logic dictates that there must be a link. Someone went to a great deal of effort to track me down and to lead you to me. Do you think this is all linked to the "Jackal Lanterns"? - The what? - [loud crash] [cackling] Mr. Nye, this is Fred. Come in, Mr. Nye. Over. [Nye] ...and that's on top of the social pressures. You know, dolphins have kind of a mean streak... [man] Seriously, Mr. Nye. Thanks again. It's past their bedtimes now, so maybe we could just wrap this up. [Nye] Oh, no. No problem. Have a happy Halloween, everyone. [sighs] Great. Power steering's gone. This thing is tight! Hey, we should just switch outfits. Why? Think about it. You're famous, so naturally the monsters will try to eat you first. If I'm dressed like you, I can act as bait while you stay safe. I've heard of being hungry for fame, but this is ridiculous. - [cackles] - [window squeaks] All right. I'm up for anything. Give me your scarf. - [cackling] - Huh? [yells] [Fred gasps] - Computer. - [automated voice] Acknowledged. Mike and Michelle need our help. [automated voice] Initiating rescue protocols. - [screams] - [laughing] Lasers. Computer, use the lasers on the pumpkins. [automated voice] Activating type 1-4 UV laser defense system, patent pending. [powering up] All right. Now we're talking. - [alarm blares] - [powering down] The power's down. [yells] And this whole thing's electric. Game over, man. Game over. Ha! Found the flaw. - [loud crash] - [all yelling] [roaring] - Daddy? - Yeah, baby. Now I really have to go. Guys! [both scream] [roars] [honking horn playing funeral march] Come on. Hurry. Get in the car, Velma. I can't leave Dr. Crane in there. Yeah, you can. It's easy. I already did it. "Don't worry. I won't sting you," said the scorpion to the frog. [cackles] [gasps] Whoa. [screaming] [straining] [yelling] [groans] I'll need my personal effects. [cackling] Extenuating circumstances. [roars] Freddy, Mike, Michelle, grab on! A little help, Dr. Crane? Dr. Crane? Dr. Crane? [exhales] What did you expect, Velma? Hang on. [laughing] [sobbing] Be brave, baby. Be brave. There is no time for bravery. Run! [all screaming] [beeps] - Ow! - Freddy! [Fred yells] Yoink! [roars] [grunts] [yelps] I love your work. Big fan. Oh, with an outfit like that, you'd better be. No! Phew. [gasps, screams] [gasps] Um, I don't want to be a party pooper or anything, but we're out of gas. [engine sputtering] Uh, now what? Jeepers. It's the creepers. Like, man, I vote we run. [howling] [sighs] I'm sorry, everyone. I failed. What are you talking about, Velma? I got cocky after we captured Scarecrow. Before, even. Like the Sheriff said, he's been warning us that we're in over our heads since we caught the Trash Monster of Scranton. The poor Sheriff. I assumed we couldn't fail, and that I couldn't make a mistake. Because of that, I didn't listen to Scooby and Shaggy. Now we've had someone arrested for a crime they didn't commit, and we're no closer to solving this mystery. And we lost a shoe and some good luggage. And we're on the run for our lives. It's these dumb Jackal Lanterns. They're unstoppable. That's not true. We've stopped a lot of them. They smash real good. Yeah, but there are so many of them. And that alpha pumpkin seems to disrupt anything electrical that gets near it. We don't need gadgets, Velma. We have me. What are you going to do, Freddy? I'm going to do what I do best. I'm gonna do traps. [distant howling and cackling] [battle cry] Ugh. These Jackal Lanterns are like a force of pure chaos that resists every attempt to apply order. If I can just get a few quiet minutes in my mind palace, maybe I can puzzle this out. Well, if Scoob and I were in your mind palace, we'd help you look. And I'd be the handsome prince who lived there. [chuckles] I wish I could take you two into my mind palace. We'd just break something. Seriously. Sometimes I think I don't appreciate what you guys bring to the table. We wouldn't have a Scooby gang without a Shaggy and a Scooby. - Well, there is a way. - A way to what? A way we can join you in your mind palace. [Scooby-Doo reading] Scooby Snacks? [Scooby-Doo gulps] What are you... [sputtering] Hey. These actually aren't bad. Scooby Snacks bring people together. And they're delicious. And now that we've all shared Scooby Snacks together, a part of us will be right there with you when you go to your happy place. - Mind palace. - That too. Thanks for the gesture, guys. It was really sweet. Okay, think, Velma. Think like your life depends on it. Okay, Ms. Dinkley. Time to review the facts. - Like, for some reason I thought there was going... - [yelps] ...to be a lot more math floating around. You guys are really in my mind palace? - As advertised. - It's the Mystery Machine. Weird. Your mind palace looks like the Mystery Machine. For some reason I thought it was gonna be a hobbit hole. Yeah. Nerd stuff. It can look like anything you want it to. I guess this is just where I feel the most comfortable. So, like, what do we do? We just drive through my memory and look for clues. Let's start with the Halloween parade. [crashing] Drive a little further. Stop! Scarecrow's equipment. He said it was stolen from Toe Omni-Tech. Hmm. Huh? Hmm. Imaginary. Oh. Come on. We need to hurry. Oh, boy. [nervous laugh] This is starting to creep me out, man. Like, we shouldn't have come. Shaggy, Scooby. You were in the pumpkin patch too. What did you see? We, like, saw the Totalli Frame drones here and then the pumpkins started to come to life. Totalli Frame? Yeah. That's what it said on the side. It was spelled all funny. See? Ah. Totalli Frame. [Fred] Time's up, guys. They found us. [distant cackling] - How'd the mind tricks go? - Mind palace. And not great. These things aren't real. I just can't prove it yet. I have no doubt that science will prevail eventually, but there's something I trust even more than science. - Bazookas? - No, silly. It's you guys. Now let's go smash some pumpkins. [gasping] [nose squeaks] [explosion] Yes. Mystery Incorporated... incorporate. [all yelling] ♪ You and me were meant to be I knew it from the start ♪ ♪ Sugar sweet You were like a thief ♪ ♪ The way you stole my heart ♪ ♪ Perfume Just like butterscotch ♪ ♪ A smile, oh, so fine ♪ ♪ Seeing you, I somehow knew I'd make you mine ♪ ♪ Oh, look at us now ♪ ♪ Nothin' that We can't overcome ♪ ♪ Always down To have some fun ♪ ♪ Oh, look at us now ♪ ♪ Never thought this could be ♪ ♪ But look at us now ♪ ♪ Look at us now ♪ [roaring] - Stop. - [roaring, cackling stops] It worked. I'll admit it. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of failing. Of failing science. Failing justice. Failing my friends. But you've been using those fears against me. And I'm not afraid of you anymore. [Velma grunts] [all] Velma! [sinister laughter] - [Velma] Freddy. The app. - [gasps] Punch it. [all groan] [giggles] Yay, high score. [roaring faints] - Velma? - Velma? Are you in there? - It was a robot? - Drones, to be more precise. I owe that discovery to Shaggy and Scooby. [Scooby-Doo] Hmm? Shaggy and Scooby noticed that the Scarecrow's drones had some writing on them. Shaggy thought it said "Totalli Frame," but the "Al" and the "Li" were written like elements on the periodic table. Aluminum and lithium. The text actually read "TOT Aluminum Lithium Frame," meaning that the drone itself was made from a lightweight lithium alloy. Light, but strong enough to carry something heavy like Scarecrow's gas tanks. Or a pumpkin. All drones. Go figure. What about the Sheriff and Victoria Hasenpfeffer and everyone who got turned into pumpkins? They're still right here. [all gasping] Ugh, my ankles are swollen. [gasping] [Velma] Everybody got put into the monster's mouth, then their personal possessions were switched - to a Jackal Lantern drone and sent back out. - Hey. The big guy here puts out an electromagnetic pulse which disrupts electronics and makes sure that no one can contact the outside world once they've been eaten. The same would've happened to me if I hadn't known what I was getting into. So that weird Scarecrow guy did it after all. No. Dr. Crane was telling us the truth. He was framed to draw us in and distract us. Distract us from what? Bill Nye reminded us that Crystal Cove is rich in lithium. The proposed lithium mine would have run under Crystal Cove, but it never happened because the science said it would damage the environment. Oh, man. Like the town square collapsing. That's right. Someone decided to mine the lithium anyway, and engineered this whole mess to cover it up. Someone who's gotten to know us well enough that he can push our buttons. Let's see what happens when we start pushing his. [buzzing] Huh? I'll take the "big reveal" from here, Velma. - [Shaggy] Reveal? - [Daphne] Who's that? - [overlapping conversations] - What's happening? Who is that? [all] The Sheriff! That's right. But Sheriff who? You never bothered to ask. I kept telling you ever since you unmasked the Trash Monster of Scranton that you were in over your heads. I warned you that if you kept meddling in other people's business, that there would be consequences. It was me. These last few years, it was all me pulling the strings. But why? Because he's not a sheriff at all. This is Cutler Toe, former head of Toe Omni-Tech. TOT. Also known as the Trash Monster of Scranton. [overlapping conversations] Um, I'm not seeing it. [all] What! That's right. Once you exposed my plan to make everyone think a trash monster was causing pollution instead of Toe Omni-Tech, I went to jail and lost half my stock. To make things worse, scientists said my lithium mine was going to pollute the environment, so I lost that too. In prison, I'd learned that Dr. Jonathan Crane, AKA the Scarecrow, was a fan of my tech. So I did what anyone in my situation would do. I spent my remaining millions to amass an army of drones and moved to Crystal Cove to impersonate a local Sheriff. I used my position as an authority figure to get under your skins. I'd tell you that you were breaking the law to wear down your confidence, and then tell you I supported you to build it back up. [Daphne] The old "hotsy coldsy" trick. [Cutler Toe] Once the trap was set, all I had to do was unleash my robotic drills. The robots would extract millions of dollars worth of lithium while I chased everyone out of town with my pumpkin drones. And made you kids look like fools. And I'll bet the toxic waste wasn't even toxic waste. [Cutler Toe] Thanks to you, I'm not allowed to have real toxic waste anymore. So I spent another million dollars to buy green glow sticks and I snapped them all into that tanker truck. And you might've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for these friends of mine. Friendship's O-P. Well, whatever. Go ahead and celebrate. Even you baby geniuses can't arrest a hologram. The real Cutler Toe is in a very fast sportscar packed with more money than you dweebs will ever see in your combined lifetimes. I could be halfway to Guam by now. Not even the Feds can catch me. We'll see about that. Right? What do you think, Mr. Nye? Did we keep him talking long enough? Perfect, Velma. He's headed southbound, still on Highway 13 by the Oak exit. Hope that sportscar is as swift as justice, Mr. Toe. No! No! [Malarkey] That's Toe's car, all right. He couldn't have gotten far. Come on, it's not like someone could just swoop in and grab him. [crows cawing] [engine sputtering] [Elvira] Well, at least if the dead ever come out of this graveyard, they'll have a lot of dead cars to choose from. I can't believe it. I think they're all wrecked. [groans] These shoes are the real monsters. Well, they say that the best way to get to know someone is to walk a mile in their shoes, young Mentee of the Dark. [sighs] It is a nice night for a walk. Yeah, I'm not complaining. Like, me either, Scoob. All that sitting and screaming wears you out. Yeah, makes you hungry. Hey, guys, check it out. I did not lead us astray. Civilization. Dude. You are a lifesaver. For real this time. I'm... I'm still not sure I ever want to see you again, though. Happy trails, partner. Keep in touch, Mike. I don't think Calamity Jane here would let me have it any other way. Hey! You guys looking for the Halloween party? No. We don't have perfect costumes. Can't you see that? Oh. Well, I thought you guys were dressed like those kids from the news. The Mystery Teens or whatever. [Fred] Uh, Mystery Incorporated. Yeah, man. Anyway, come on in. We don't have an invitation. Uh, well, good, 'cause we didn't make any. [laughing] Is there food? Only if you count the sandwich tray, cheese fountain, the cookie station, the ice cream bar, Uncle Ernie's hot wings, and the taco truck. I can also make you some pizza bagels if you want... [laughs] - What do you think, gang? - Dancing? Looks like fun to me. I'm in. I know I shouldn't ask, but, really... can I have the wig? It's not a wig. Daphne, have you been trying to get Elvira's outfit as a costume all along? No. But that's a great idea. Now we can go to this party. Wait. Were you just trying to replace Elvira and take over her life? She's done this before. [chuckles nervously] We once solved three mysteries with Phyllis Diller before we even figured it out. You are one weird kid. And I'm proud to be your Mentor of the Dark. It's not a wig. It's a macaque. - [screeches] - And her name is Meredith. Go ahead. Put her on. You've earned her. After the day we've had, I'm not even gonna ask. You coming, Elvira? Nah. I'm afraid I'm due back at my usual haunt. Well, thanks again. See you around. Every couple of hours, just stick a piece of fruit or some nuts up in there. And, like, maybe if you find a cockroach or snail. But those are sometimes foods. Got it. You're the best, Elvira. I know. Well, there you have it, my children of the night. The true story of the fourth weirdest Halloween night I've ever had. And what have we learned? That friendship is stronger than monsters. That there's an answer to every mystery. And that there is nothing to fear, but fear itself. And maybe this. [distorted voice] Happy Halloween. [laughing] Ah. Ooh. Ooh. [sobbing] [heart thumping] - She's alive. She's alive! - [thunder crackling] [Scooby-Doo] Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
