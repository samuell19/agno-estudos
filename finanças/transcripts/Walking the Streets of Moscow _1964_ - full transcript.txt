What? Nothing... You leaving or just arrived? Me? Meeting someone. - Who? - My husband. - Oh, yeah?! - Yeah, really. My husband. Must be nice to be met! Get married and you will be! - You feel good? - Really good! - No, that can't be! - Yes, it can be! Yes, it can be! I WALK AROUND MOSCOW Lift it up! Starring: Nikita Mikhalkov Aleksei Loktev Galina Polskikh Yevgeny Steblov Don't push! Take it easy! What're you looking at? Which station do I need for Stroitelny Lane? - I'm just visiting. - Which lane? It's in Cheryomushki. Cheryomushki? No, it's not out there. Listen... Go to Paveletskaya, up the escalator to the left to the shoe repair - you'll find your way. That's not it at all, even you don't know. Get off at Kirovskaya, go 3 blocks turn right and there you are. How would you know? I know Moscow like the back of my hand! And you like helping others? I was born here. I could tell you a thing or two about Moscow. - Clever, are you? - Very. - Think you're clever? - I do. Watch out someone doesn't crack you one! Teach you to be clever! It's a draw. - Clear Ponds? - Yes. Once called Dirty Ponds, but Peter I had them cleaned and renamed. - Visiting? - Yeah, from Kachemsk. - Where's that? - Siberia! - On business? - Passing through... Stuck... - Viktor? - Hi. - Viktor. - Ermakov. Why didn't you come by? Mother was disappointed. I couldn't, a meeting. Anya didn't tell you? - She wasn't there either. - Where was she then? - She doesn't tell me anything. - Where else would she go? Maybe she came after 11, that's when I went to work. No, she was home by then. - See you. - Good-bye. - Brother? - Cousin. - Married? - No. Me neither. Thanks, mister. - Friend of children. - It was nothing. - Asta! Asta! - Got bitten. You've just earned 40 shots. - Think it's rabid? - Look at that drool. Disgraceful! Get your dog out of here! Whose dog? - Your dog? - They gave it to me to look after. - Who? - Some lady. - Where's she now? - In church. - Come on, show me. - I won't go in. - Why? - An atheist. I won't make you pray. Show me. You'll recognize her, she's got on a cotton kerchief. Forgive as you are forgiven... Hello. Sorry, is it your dog outside? Excuse me! Is it your dog outside? Is that your dog outside? - Did you leave the dog outside? - Did it run away? Your dog? Let's go outside... - Yours? - Yes, ours. - I'm off then. - Go on! Show her. While you pray your bulldog bites people. - Forgive me! - That's God's job! - Healthy? - Got sick once... I'm not asking about cholera! - Is she rabid or not? - How would I know... Probably not. - What about the drool? - Maybe she's hungry? We feed her a ton, and she's still hungry! Hungry, God's servant! Should get shots in case. - Are you selling the dog? - No. - ID? - She's got tags. - That means nothing. - No, it bit me, that's all. I see: you - to the hospital, the dog - to the slaughterhouse, the owner - to court! It's the landlady's dog! I studied this language so long and understand nothing. This is me! Take the first lane on the right. - Thanks! - Good-bye! It's bad to read while you eat! - Take off that record! - What? Take off the record! I can't sleep! - Play it more quietly, can't you? - I can't, or I'll get distracted! Don't get distracted! Long time, no see! No one's home. Seems they've left. Can I leave my things with you? - Don't want to carry them all day. - C'mon up! - Something to eat? - No, thank you... Do you have needle and thread? Trousers got torn. Katya, get a needle and thread. Just who needs it? Me! Hello! A dog bit him. Sew his trousers, Katya! You go get Vanya from kindergarten and I'll sew your friend's trousers! I can do it myself. - This is my sister, the beauty. - Idiot. Give them to me, I won't look. Take them off while you can! Come on, hurry, I'm late as it is! - Some tea? - No. Have a seat. OK, you get Vanya from kindergarten, and get your grandmother whatever she needs, she's not well. And do the dishes! Don't talk back, for once in your life. I'm not, I'm just tired... We all work. A man works all night and everyone nags him, right? - I'll do the dishes, if you'd like. - We would. That does it... - You here for long? - I leave this evening. Too bad. I'm off. - Good-bye! - All the best! Pushkin once lived in that building. - Who lives there now? - Relatives. His great-grandson plays wing for "Torpedo." - What d'ya want? - How's the leg? - What'd the doctors say? - They suspect it's the knee cap. - A resemblance! - Maybe... - Hello! - Hello! Your children? - Yes. - A lot! This is Misha, Kolya's father, Sanechka, Lyosha, Vitya. They all died in the war - and I live. C'mon, grandmother! All boys. I'd make shirt for Sanechka, then Vitya'd wear it, then Misha, and never complained. But he had big feet... ...and got the boots after Sanechka. Grandmother... Turn off the music! Don't you understand Russian! Kolya! - Come with me to the draft board! - What for? We'll ask them for a deferral! - But they gave you a deferral. - No they didn't, I got scared when I got to the door. I feel awkward asking myself, and already told Sveta they did. Sasha, I slept 43 minutes. Shatalov, Alexander Industrieich. Due here the 5th. - So? - He's getting married today. - So? - He'd like a deferral. Had no time to marry before? Seen a fiance put it off like that, Angelina Petrovna? How old are you? I'm not getting married, another is. Expecting a child? No. Hey, what happens if you lose your draft card? Don't know. Go on in... They're asking for you. - Permission to enter! - Enter! - This is the fiance. - How old is he? - 19. - Too young to marry. At his age I was at the battle of Kursk. - Sit down, Alexander Industrievich. - Thank you, I'll stand. Why'd you send you lawyer instead of coming yourself? - He's shy, Comrade Mayor. - I see. - You expecting a son or a daughter? - In what sense? That's not the reason, Comrade Major. Got a request? Let me see it... Alexander Industrieich! With your permission!? Svetlana Mikhailovna, please! Sveta! It's me, we got a month. Happy? You don't sound happy! It's awkward to talk? Something I did? - Kolya says hi. - With all my heart. The suit? We're going to buy it now. I'll take Kolya with me. - OK. - No, I can't go, I need to sleep. He'll go. Sveta, don't you love me? Yeah-yes? - Or yeah-no? - Let's go, people are waiting! Kisses, Sveta! Sasha, don't you love me? - What? - Yeah-yes? Or yeah-no? This way, from here... to over here... Excuse me, please, are you looking for buried treasure? Who are you? What's it to you? C'mon, let's go! It's just the 4th time you've been digging here. We're digging 'cos we got to! - Got it? - Got it! - You guys speak foreign languages? - Which? I don't know. Been driving 2 hours, keep asking him where to go, and he just waves left, right... 6 rubles on the meter and here we are. - I see. - I say pay up and get out! He doesn't know a word of Russian! What's he talking about? He's in raptures about our amazing capital... I think he needs to go to the Tretyakov Gallery. To the Tretyakov Gallery? Not this way, they're building the Novy Arbat, New Arbat, - you see... - Tell him about the money... Tell him about the money. No, I can understand but I can't speak. Listen, come with me? I'll drop you off anywhere you want free. Should I get e 3-piece? I don't know. If I were you I wouldn't buy one. You've already got one, and when you get out there'll be a new style. It's grey-I need a black one. - Going into the army? - Uh-huh! - Why do you need a suit? - He's getting married. Fool! - Have fun while you're young! Navy? - Infantry. He's been here already. Peace, friendship! Ask him if he's Chinese. Excuse me... Are you Chinese? No, Japanese. No, Japanese. Silks and furs on sale for credit on the first floor, first row.

Listen! Lend us your suit. You can pick it up this evening. He's getting married. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Agreed? - No, I'll buy one. - But he's giving it to you! I'm not getting married in another's suit! No one will know! Why waste money? Better to buy your wife something. - You think? - Of course! - You want it now? - He has to be at the registry by 5. You'll have it by 5! He's been driving me out of my mind with this suit. - Sasha! - What? Let's buy a boat. 100 rubles! - What for? - We'll take a break... and sail to the Black Sea. Sail where? I'm going in the army. - What about after the army? - We'll buy one then. Gimme 2 kopecks. Thanks. - So, you're a writer. - No. Don't lean! - A fitter. - So what's this? It was for our local journal.

Looks like him. "Taiga." - Miss, I haven't got all day. - Right away. Volodya, give Alyona your story. I haven't got one now, but I can stop by later! So you work out in the taiga? Lucky guy, it's quiet there... Move out there. - And what would I do? - Sell records. - In the forest? - We'll build you a shop. - So, you build shops? - No, it's a chemical plant. And soon it'll be done by machine. Thank God. At least you won't flirt with machines. So, can someone with no advanced degrees become a geologist? Of course not a geologist, but go on expeditions and study at the same time? - Of course. - Why leave? We need geologists in Moscow, too, for the Metro. - It's true. - Comrades, come on now! Here, take your record and go, I don't need complaints. Good-bye. I'll bring you a copy. Here. So we're agreed? I'll meet you after work downstairs and we'll go to the wedding. And then you can go to the taiga. - And you? - Have you got Robertino? - No. - Why not? Increased sales. Look! There's your Anya! - Hi, Kolya! - Hi... Too bad we don't have a camera. We could take a photo and show it to your cousin, poor fool. Enough. What a family! In front of your eyes - don't get it. Forget it, it's not your concern. I'd have killed him if I were you... You'll have time on your own. Kill him when you get out of the army. What're you hinting at? You'll have your own reason for killing. You saying that you don't trust Sveta? That's not what I meant. Anything's possible. Repeat that! Say that again! A soldier has a heavy fate Unlike a friend who waits... - Go on then! Hit me! - Calm down! Enough, calm down! - Fool! - You're the fool! Look, it didn't break. - She said they're all unbreakable. - Forget him. Hey, you think she'd really move to Siberia? - Who? - Alyona. Yeah, she's already getting packed to go spin records "My dear friend the kind shepherd." Wait! Kick my foot, or we'll fight. Along with the Execution Block, other ancient wonders include the Cathedral of the Intercession, otherwise known as St. Basil's, built from 1555-1560 to commemorate the defeat of Kazan... And to the left stands GUM, built in the pseudo-Russian style from the end of the 19th century. - Get outta here! - OK. The Cathedral is unique in that it unifies 8 onion-domed chapels. Listen how do you get to... - Kirov Street? - Uh-huh. You go straight to Children's World, at the 4th street go right. - See you. - See you. Where're you going? - Voronov lives there. - Who? The writer. Asked me over. He read my story. Hey wait...! - I'll go with you. - Where? To Voronov! Well... to meet him. - It's kind of awkward. - Tell him I'm a novice poet. Let's go! Svetlana Mikhailovna, please. Sveta, hi, it's me. I just wanted to... Why do you sound so unhappy? It's OK. Sveta? Hello? - Can you make change? - Sorry. - Can you make change? - I'll have a look. Here. Svetlana Mikhailovna, please! Why'd you hang up? Why? It's not nice talking to me? Is it? You won't have me around much longer, if that's what you want! Forget it! ...let's see if they're friends. - Who'd you need? - To see Comrade Voronov. - Come in! - Hello. Hello, wipe your feet! I turn to my friends... That way. Make the steppe my bed Covered in fog... Are you Comrade Voronov? What's on your mind? They told me you'd read my story and wanted to talk about it. I'm Ermakov. A beginner? Sit down. What's your story called? - "Taiga," in YOUTH. - What d'ya know! A writer. Everyone is, these days. Pretend... this is a screen. The jacks get stuck in the tubing, these rings of reinforced concrete. The screen can cut into the rock, you see... Tell me later. - Who are you? - A poet. Works in the Metro. Like Lev Tolstoy. - What? - Nothing. You heard the saying, if you can't write, don't? I don't have to write. Didn't you like it? We like girls. Literature is art. What's it about? - It's about good people. - Not enough! A writer should get to the core of life! What do you do? - He's a fitter. - A fitter... A writer is an engineer of human souls. Think your prose rings true? Opportunist! Where'd you get that idea? Because literature has its rules! If there's a rifle on the wall, it has to be fired! What rifle? There's no rifle... - That was Chekhov, right? - Don't be funny! I'm being figurative. Each character must be true to life. Yours aren't. I don't know, maybe it's not the greatest, and my rifle doesn't fire, but it's all true. - Truth - with no essence. - What essence? A fundamental essence. People let this guy in the house... ...feed him, give him a drink, and don't ask for money. Essence? Either they wanted to take money, or just pretended. - Pretend to who? - The guy in the story. Or themselves. What kind of good people are we? So to you, people are selfish? People! It wasn't for nothing the Greeks said... ...people are governed by 3 things: love, hunger, fear of death-egoism! I don't know about the Greeks, but during the war an unknown woman took me and my sister in, fed us, raised us, which wasn't easy. Or was she pretending? And those who died for our homeland? Were also pretending? And love? Love is only egoism! Egoism. Listen, I had a love once. A woman. I broke my leg, didn't work a month, and she married another man. There's a story! - You think she loved me? - I doubt it. Exactly! She was pretending! - And now? - What now? - Leg stopped hurting? - It's all better. Listen last year I went to Orel... So we had a bit to drink, and I went to the store... ...had a lie down on a bench, fell asleep, woke up... ...no watch, coat taken. That's a story! The story? A writer should really get to the essence of life. I'm writing a novel. - Good morning! - We said good morning this morning! I was just having a chat till the floors dry. Hello, boys. I'm Voronov. Ermakov... I have a project for you. We want to publish a collection of young Siberian writers. You could help us, you know your writers well. I don't get it! - Who was that? - Floor polisher. - He's really clever. - I'm afraid of him myself. Aleksei Petrovich! I read your novel... And... - And? - Talented, - but not... - What? Not true to life. What do you want? I don't want a deferral! What deferral? I don't need the extra month! Ah, it's you, fiance? Didn't recognize you! - It's hot out! - Changed your mind? - Yes, sir! - It happens. - You'll marry after the army. - I'll never get married! Wedding Registry - A quick shine? - No. - There's the fiancee. - And the fiance? Sasha! He bought a suit. With that haircut he looks like a common criminal! Where's apartment 92? - Don't know. - Who do you need from 92? - Alyona. - You mean Lena? - Not here. - Where is she? At a concert in the park. - Pity! - Had plans to meet? No I just had a question for her... - What question? - What's it to you? I'm her father! Really? I just wanted to know if she really wanted to come with us or not. - With who? With you? - To Kachemsk. - What Kachemsk? - To Siberia! - What'd she forget in Kachemsk? - Nothing. Maybe she's bored of selling records. What records? You can see it's immortal love, right? - Why would she go to you? - Not to me... To no one! - So you came to Moscow for her? - No! - Then why? - A stopover. - Got you! - Here's another! I got to GUM, they told me another postman asked for her address. Knew it was you! Where is she? At a concert, let's go! Remember I introduced them, he took her away! Where'd they meet? - At GUM today. - Her father. Didn't have time to get acquainted and already want to get married. Hello, I'm Nikolai. - Which park? - Gorky Park. - Who's getting married? - Your friend! - Taking her to Siberia! - Oh?... No, can't be. Wife, children, - he's a writer. - Get lost, writers, before I wring your necks! - Damn, that wasn't too good. - Chatterbox! - Me? - You! What? Wind bag! - That's how it is? - That's right. - See you. - All the best. Hey! Alyona! Come here! Come on! - What for? - Come here! - What? - Hi! - So, let's go? - Where? The wedding! They're waiting! So, friends, the first act is over. Intermission 30 minutes. So then he says "Get out of here before I wring your necks!" You deserved it. There he is! So, writer, - don't recognize us? - I do, good evening. - What's wrong? - Don't want to bother you. Don't be silly! - Let's go? - I'm not going. Why? Then I'll hypnotize you. Look into my eyes. Don't. I get hypnotized at work all day. If that's how you want it. I'm telepathic: I order you to turn around! He will. - Anytime soon? - Now! Telepathy! Again! - Where'd he go? - Don't know. - That's a watch! - My grandfather's! Let me see. Not like that! - Thanks! - No thanks. What's going on? Giving out prizes. - What kind? - All kinds. I'll go look. Are you here on business? A stopover. - I was on leave, in Minsk. - Visiting relatives? No, a friend's parents. He died last year, hunting, fell under ice. So we visit his parents every year. - You made up your mind? - About what? About moving. Let's go have a look! Comrades, we need two more people. Don't be shy, comrades. Women too! Miss, come this way please. Don't be shy. Not you, thank you, you'd better sit and watch. We need one more... Young man, this way please! Now we're going to play an interesting game. There'll be two teams, and whoever draws an original horse the fastest wins. - You have 5 seconds. - Not enough! And you'll count with me. Let's practice all together now. Let's go... One, two, three... That was good, quiet please. You draw the body, you-the legs and tail, me-the head and ears. - Ready? - Ready. - Go! - One, two... That's good! So, this team got best time, but the quality... What does this horse remind you of? Kangaroo! Crocodile! Right! So, this team wins! - What're you doing? - What'd I do wrong? - He was trying to steal! - I was not! - Catch him, he's a thief! - You're the thief! Grab him! Citizens! He's a bandit! Hey, you didn't pay the bill! Catch him! Catch him! Get him! No the other one! Get him! Stop! Tickets, please, tickets! Where're you going?! - What happened? - He was running away! - Are there witnesses? - Wait, I'm a witness! I'm the witness. - He's a thief! - What thief? - Let's go! - You got it wrong! I don't get it what exactly did he do? Just as I wrote: he was in a gang, or something like that, they were following me to rob me! - What gang? - Stay out of it! Another gang member pretended to draw a horse on stage, while he attempted to steal, and started a riot to get away... I don't get it what horse? Everything's clearly written here, but if you don't like it I'll start over. Start over. Comrade Lieutenant, - he's got it all wrong... - Write it down. As a statement or in order? - Write down what happened. - Exactly. Can I have some paper? May I? - Citizen! - Hello! - What happened? - Brought me in. - You know each other? - He's my friend. I find the thief and they drag me in. ID, please. - Where's Alyona? - I can't find it... Comrade Lieutenant, let him go. He's a writer on a stopover and leaves tonight. Volodya, show him your ticket, please. You can hold me if you like. - Known each other long? - Since morning. And what difference does it make? He's the one drawing the horse! Get him! Why are you holding me? Tell them you drew the horse. - I did. - He admits it! You followed me in the park, chased me! Quiet! No need to shout! - He admits it! - What horse? He's confessed, you see! - Did you chase him? - We were walking behind him. What were you following him for? We wanted to see what he'd do. Hypnotizers! Put you in a trance then strip you! He's out of his mind! - Think about what you're saying! - I've got a concussion, anything can happen and it won't be my fault! - He's drunk! - He is! - Comrade Lieutenant, he's drunk... - Lies! Barefaced lies! He reeks of vodka. Sniff him, Comrade Lieutenant, check his breath! You've got me all mixed up with your hypnotic writers and horses with concussions. You, this way. - They've confused us all! - Take it easy... Just one little mug of beer. Tiny! Have a seat. There. Now calmly write everything down so that we can understand it. You two sit on that bench and wait. - We can't, there's... - It's an outrage! I'll complain. Ah, go ahead! Not very polite... Then please do! One ice cream! There's a criminal over there! I'll distract him and you go get a cop. Just give me time to go over. - Comrade! - What? I have a favor to ask... Would you take a ride on the rocket with me? You see, I want to make someone jealous. - What? - What what? I'll give you 3 rubles. 5. - 3.15. After! - Give it here! They're in that plane! Excuse me, may I ask a favor? We're on our way to a wedding, and our friend has strict parents. She wants to call home from a friend's, they'll say, put her on, and we don't have one! - Where's your friend? - Over there! - What's your mother's name? - Maria Nikolaevna. Hello, Maria Nikolaevna! What's my name? This is Nadya. - What's your name? - Alyona. Alyona's with me. - What are we doing? - Nothing. Nothing special, just reading a book aloud! Good night. - Thank you! - Not at all! And you? What's up? What happened? It's bad to read when you eat! What's with him? - They've put off the wedding. - What do you mean? Sveta found out he didn't want to. - Wait, how's that? - He told "I'm not getting married!" - Shut up! - He's crazy. They'll teach him discipline in the army. - This true? - Yes! - You've had the ceremony? - We did... now we'll get divorced! - Right away! - Not right away. We'll go to court first. Don't stand... Sit down! Enjoy yourselves! Thanks, we have already. Let's go. Congratulations! Kolya, we'll be downstairs! Kolya, does he need to give back the gifts? Of course! People gave them to make them happy, not because they were getting married - or not. - Get out of here! Turn it on! People are dancing. My day started with dancing. It's ending the same way. You managed to dance this morning? Not me. When I landed, a girl was dancing, alone, no music, just humming. A ballerina. She just felt good. When people feel good, you can see it immediately. Pretty? Well... Quite pretty. Like today's girls. I asked, "You feel good?" - and she said... - ...really good! And I said "That can't be!" And she? Yes, it can be... Thank you! Where's your mom? Went to Sveta's. Drink? No! We argued on the telephone, so I told the officer I could start. They we went to the registry, then back to the officer to get another deferral. That's how she found out. But now I'm a free man! - Egoist. - What? Egoist! It's easy to kick a man when he's down! You didn't get dumped by your fiancee. She loves you! - A lot can change in 2 years. - How did my mother wait 5 years? - And yours? - It was the war. It's not about war, it's about people! You tore my shirt, and I though you were my friend. A guy feels bad and gets his shirt torn... - You kept moving around! - So it's all my fault, isn't it! Stop yelling. I feel so bad right now... that I don't feel like going on. I'm a real jerk, Kolya. Not worth it. She won't pick up. Sveta! Sveta! Sveta! Pick up the phone, it's me! Pick it up! Hi Sveta, it's Kolya. - How're things? - Is she crying? He says he's sorry for his mistake. - Tell her I'm a jerk. - He's asked me to tell you he's an idiot. - Not an idiot but a jerk! - He'll tell you himself. Sveta? I'm just... so nervous. GOGOL Get going, you'll be late. We're going to Voronezh for a competition soon... Good-bye, Kolya, - thanks for everything. - You take care. I'm sorry I can't see you home. I have to go to work. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Sometimes you feel good But don't know why It was the summer rain Or a familiar face Happy eyes Reflecting the Ring Road Then the summer storm And I walk around Moscow One day I'll cross... Young man! Why're you yelling? I'm singing. Citizen! Come here! Get over here! - Keep singing! - OK. And so I walk around Moscow One day I'll cross The salty Pacific The tundra, the taiga I'll raise a white sail But don't know with whom If I start feeling homesick I'll find a violet in the snow And remember Moscow Written by: Gennady Shpalikov Director: Georgy Daneliya Director of Photography: Vadim Yusov Art Director: A.
