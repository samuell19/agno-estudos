(MultiCom Jingle) (soft tense music) (keyboard clicking) - Beans! Kitty, you're not supposed to be here. No your not, I know you want to eat the fish. Oh, kitty! I got to go, go back to sleep. Kitty kitty. Kitty kitty. - But then Mr. Mouth said, "I don't have anything to say to you." And he ran away too. Mr. Nose had said, "I won't play with you." Ms. Ear had said, "I won't play with you." And now Mr. Mouth wouldn't play with him. It's terrible, awful. Wouldn't anybody ever play with him? Just then Mr. Eye turned a corner and came face to face, or rather eye to eye with another eye just like him. "Hi," the other eye said brightly. My names is Ms. Eye, what's yours? - [Jeff] Jeff! - Jeff? My name is Mr. Eye. - Tiny, no bumping. Tina! No bumping. Look at me. Look at me, Tina. Thank you for looking at me. I like it when you do. You have such pretty eyes. Okay. Alright. - I'll rent Kiss me Deadly and Double Indemnity. You'll come over, we'll have popcorn, what do you say? - Dan's leaving tonight, maybe after. - Forget it. - Why? - You think I wanna sit there and look at you? That man is so hot. - He's not bad. - I'd give my doctorate for a guy like that. Sell him to me please. - Alice. - Susan, can I see you for a moment? I got a call today about a little boy named Evan Parks. - No way. - [Chris] Age five, severe aberrational behavior. I'd like you to evaluate him. - Chris, I'm working with six children as it is. I'm in the middle of my dissertation, I am swamped. - So is everybody else. His parents sent over his history, I said we'd see them tonight. - Dan's leaving at seven, sorry. - No problem. I'll call them, we'll make it for eight. - You wouldn't believe the progress I've made, mom. We finally finished the bathroom and I put up this little wall between the, sorry, between the office and the dining room. Of course I'm coming. Well you know I wouldn't miss your anniversary party for the world. Hang on I'll ask him. Dad wants to know if the Marine is coming. - You tell him, if the Marine can juggle his flight schedule, the Marine will be there. - He says maybe. Okay I gotta go. I love you. Alright, bye. They've been married for 50 years. Dad's like a little kid again. He just rented the Elk's Hall for their party. Mr. Beans! You get away from there kitty, you aren't supposed to do that. No no, you're not supposed, kitty don't I feed you enough? - Susan, that fish can take care of himself. He's Thai fighting fish. They eat cats for breakfast. - Is that what they told you when you bought it? - Yeah. That's one of the great things of flying all over the world, you get great gifts to bring home to your girlfriend. - Here you go. Yuck. - Sometimes these guys aren't so friendly. - How long this time? - Just an overnight hop. Be back tomorrow. - I'll still miss you. I always miss you. - So marry me. - Whoa! Whoa. I let you move in here, Buster, what more do you want? We'll set a date, maybe. - Come on, let's eat. - Evan had just turned four here. - [Man] Hi everybody, big smile. - A few children in the neighborhood and all the nieces and nephews. - Our doctor then, Dr. Vance said he thought it would be fine to have a party. - Quack. Coming into it, watch the bat. - Look at that, it's a bat. - [Man] Look at that Evan, look at the bat. Grab the bat Evan. - Okay, we'll try another present. What about this one? Evan! - Evan, Evan! We got the bat away from him before he could hurt any of the kids. - I don't think we need to see anymore, Mr. Parks, thank you. - Has there been any significant change in the way that he relates to you? - He doesn't relate to us. He doesn't see us, there's nothing. - I'd like to meet him. - Evan. Evan this Miss Andrews. - Evan. My name is Susan, Evan. (low tense music) - It's time, Gumby. Bag your face. - What about the other people in the store, man? - Those other people in the store, we own them. Hey. Gross, huh? (suspenseful instrumental music) Hey! We're here. Put it in the bag. You take four eyes and his old lady in the back. - I can't do it. - Come on, move! - [Robber] Get back. Move move! - They don't try something. - That's all the money there is. - [Edward] Nice work. Let's go. - Please, don't kill me. Please. Please. - Luther, get real. - Please. - [Edward] I'm just gonna lock you up in the cold room to buy some time. - Don't do this. - That's all. - Man. No, no. Hey no man. No. No, no! No, no. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Give me your professional opinion, doctor. - Doctor? A bit premature aren't you? You know, Chris at the rate you're working me, I'm never going to finish my dissertation. - So give me your layman's opinion. - Possibly autistic, could be emotionally disturbed. But in any event, I'm gonna have to run a diagnostic evaluation. - Your game then. - Do I have a choice? - None. Evan Parks, first thing in the morning. - Night Chris. (suspenseful instrumental music) - I can't believe what you did, man. You just wasted those people. Just smoked them, man. - Yeah man, stop your whining man. You're acting like something outrageous happened. Junky, they freak me out, needles. (suspenseful instrumental music) - [Robber] Look out! - Come on, stupid, gotta go. - Hey, are you alright? (sirens blaring) - Think you could recognize this guy if you saw him again, Miss Andrews? - Yes, I got a very clear look at him. - Okay. - I can't believe the guy just ran away. What if I'd been hurt? - There are people in this city, Miss, who don't care much about your wellbeing. - Evidently. - Eat it and choke, headbanger. Extra grease. - Man I'm starving. Like I could eat this stuff while it's still living. - It is. - Ice your face, clown. You look like a splatter flick. - I told him. Got all these Marines up here walking around on leave, don't be messing with them. What's he do? Geek. - We gonna get together later? Maybe go to Venice, bust some heads. - Whatever you want. - You are flying. - I love this. I love it. - [Man] Take care man. - [Officer] Is that it? - KAO772. Same tags hit the market over on Western. It was stolen today down in Cover City. What's the final count over there? - Three out with a shotgun. - Same freak in the ski mask? - Yup. Got his total up to seven. Just for the hell of it. Picks up the casings, no prints no nothing. - Until now. You find anything? - Found a set works up under the front seat. Somebody's gonna miss it. - [Lou] Find anything else? - What you'd expect. Sunflower seeds and spit all over the place. Blood on the steering wheel. Probably from the wreck. There's a witness. - Someone saw the wreck? - Driver of the other car. Lady name Susan Andrews. - She saw the guy who drove this piece? - [Officer] She saw him. - I mean you wouldn't be kidding me or anything like that, would you? - She saw him well enough to give me damn solid description. - Yeah. Okay bring her in run some mug books. We got this guy. - Yeah. - Lieutenant. It's just, it's just too bad she'll have to go through all of this. She's a real nice lady. - Well there's not a damn thing I can do about that. Right now she's a real nice witness. - Hi, good morning. Sorry I'm late, finished with the preliminary? - What happened? - Oh it's nothing, I'm fine. - Chris said you were with the police all night? - Some guy ran into my car and then ran away and the police wanted me to look at pictures. - Mug books? - No, the police call them suspect files. - Hey what happened to you last night? - Some guy rams her car then takes off. - No, somebody wrecked your car? - It's in the repair shop, I have a loaner. - Could you finger the guy? - Yeah, I fingered the guy at like four a.m. after looking at 3,000 pictures. - Of men? (laughing) - If you two don't mind. Hi Evan. Having fun in here? I was watching you from the other room. I thought we could do something together. We could see what sort of colors you like. Or, what sort of stimuli you respond to. Do you like that? Or else we could just start off by making friends. Well, that's a start. - Suse, excuse me you got a call. - I'll call them back. - It's the police, they say it's pretty important. (people chattering) - Miss Andrews. - Hi. - How ya doing? - Uh fine. It's a lot busier here during the day. Sergeant? - Nelson. - Nelson, Nelson sorry. Well, did you find the guy? - You tell us, follow me. - Lieutenant. - Oh, Susan, welcome. How are you? - Fine. - Have a seat. - Thanks. You guys work fast. - We're the city's finest. What we're gonna do is we're gonna parade four or five of these guys out here on the stage. Now they can't see you, but I want you to watch them very carefully and see if you spot the guy that climbed out of the car last night, okay? - Fine. - Are you scared? - Of course not. - Alright then why don't we get started? Bring them in. - [Susan] Second guy from the right. - [Lou] Number four step forward. (tense music) - That's him. I'm sure of it. (low tense music) If we could wrap this up, lieutenant, I really need to get back to the center. - Call me Lou. You're some kind of a doctor, aren't you? - Yeah, well, I'm working on my doctor dissertation. I'm at the center working with children that have developmental disorders. - Sounds real nice. - It can be. When I'm there instead of somewhere else. - Can I offer you some coffee or water? I think we have some soft drinks around here. - No. Thank you but I really gotta get back. - Miss Andrews, this man you identified, is Edward Reeves. He's under arrest for the murder of seven people. - Murder? - May I get you a little water now? You can link Edward Reeves to the station where they hit you last night. 18 minutes before, two men killed three people. Got into that same station, and then drove away. Sure you don't want that water now? There have been four others. Sometimes he acts alone sometimes he brings a friend. You certain you can't identify that second man? - Oh my god. Murder. - I'm playing this straight with you Susan. But I've got to know that I can depend on you. - What do you mean depend on me? - To get this animal off the street. If you back out now we've got nothing to hold him on. People don't get involved, society breaks down, there is no society with a guy like Reeves. - You don't have to guilt me into anything. Does he know who I am? - No, he doesn't and he won't. There will be an arraignment set but I'll see to it that bail is denied. You and he won't come face to face until the trial. Then he's inside forever. - Murder? - Yes ma'am. - Well Suse, I think you've got every right to be concerned. This is serious business. - I'm not really concerned concerned. - Alright, you got this guy for murder right? What if he gets out on a technicality? Where do you stand then? - In front of my word processor unable to work. Does neurasthenia have one E or two? - Suse, something like this comes into your life it can change things. Tyrell won't tell you that because he doesn't to scare you off. Not bad huh? Veal with tarragon butter and sauteed grapes. - Couldn't we just have a hamburger sometime? - Could we just talk about this for a second please? I'm worried about you. - It bothered me a little bit today but not so much anymore. I'm doing the right thing. If more people step forward like this. - [Dan] Here we go again. - It's true. - I know it's true. And I'm very proud of you, I really am. - [Susan] Thank you. - I just don't want you to think that this policeman has everything tied up with a nice neat ribbon. - I don't, I don't. - When I was back in the corps for instance. - Oh another fighter jock story. - When I was flying F4s for Uncle Sammy back-- - Steve can ya, G8 and his battle-- - The first thing you learn out there is that it's just you. You can't even look at your wing when he's too busy covering his own behind. - We don't live in a jungle, Dan. I don't believe we're at war. That kind of talk scares me. And frankly I resent it. This is you big guy. Evan? (humming) Evan? Good job, alright. Now this is me. Pretty good picture, don't you think? Susan. Susan. - Wah wah wah, wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah. - What do you think? Will he fit in with our program? - He's a doll. - I'm sure. But will he fit in with what we do here? Is he capable of bonding with you? The bonding process just began. - [Man] Suse! Suse, you've got a visitor. - You would agree, I hope to think that in our free society Mr. Reeves deserves a fair and adequate defense. - Well, yes Mr. Toner, how did you know to find me here? - At the arraignment I made a motion for discovery attending to the prosecutor's case. - And they just gave you my name and address? - Well how else can I prepare my client's defense? Now, shall we get started? - He has an entire file on me, Lou. He knows my name and my address and my phone number. - It doesn't do Reeves any good. Remember I said his bail would be denied? - [Susan] Yes. - Well that's exactly what happened. Reeves is inside, he's gonna stay there until the trial. And like I said he's gone for good. - Are you sure? - Susan. You do your part, I do my part. Then we'll work, we'll make it work. Now I want you to rest easy and I want you to remember I'm here if you need me. - Okay. Thanks, goodnight. - Oh man. (phone rings) - Hello? Hello? (dial tone buzzes) (phone rings) Hello? (soft tense music) Hello? Who is this? Hello? (soft tense music) (dial tone buzzes) (phone rings) (people chattering) - Hey, what's happening with your murder case? - It's not my murder case. - You are the chief witness right? - Alice. - Alright alright. Geez Mr. Wonderful is out of town out it's hormonal changes. - You're incredible girl. You're great with kids and you're lousy with adults. Alright, he's been out of town a couple days. - It's a good thing he's in the bus, the way you two live on the phone. I tried to call eight times last night. Eight times, busy. That son of. - Had some trouble with people calling up. Alice, don't go out there. - Hi Susan. - I'm gonna call the police. - What's the matter? - Some guys by Susan's car. - I'll take car of them. - Cory, call the police. - No that's alright, they don't belong on center property. I'll take care of them. No, I'm alright. - [Chris] What happened? - Some guys jumped him in the parking lot. - I'll get the police. - Cory. - Put your head back. - Thanks I'm okay, alright. I'm alright. - You said I wouldn't have to worry about this guy. - Look. - You said there was no way this maniac could find out who I was before the hearing. - Reeves is still in jail. - Yeah, well his friends aren't. How did they find out about me? - There was a break in at Toner's office. Your files we riffled. - Oh that's great, that's just fabulous. They know who I am, they know where I am. They even know my bra size. - I'm sorry. - That's how they got my number. I've been having some phone calls. I've had to take the phone off the hook. - Look, is there any place you can go any place you can stay? - Move? Well, uh, no, I mean, I can't just up and leave. I've got a life to maintain. - Well that's not going to help me get my job done, is it? - Am I supposed to stick my head in the sand? - No. I'll have a black and white cruiser at your apartment every hour or so. There's two numbers here. One is an emergency response number that'll get you two blue suits if you need them right away. The other number's to me at my home or in my office you can get me. - Is there a trial date yet? - Any day now. - Listen, are you still with is? - Yeah. (soft tense music) I'm alright, Dan. Lieutenant Tyrell says he can take care of it. - What he says he can do and he does are two different things. Okay sweetheart, you gotta ditch the digs and go stay with Alice or some other safe place. See? - What could be safer than here? - Susan, come on. - You come on. You're beginning to sound like my mother. I have good locks on the door, I have police coming up and down the block all night long. This is my home. - Then back away from this thing, tell the cops you won't testify. - [Susan] I can't do that. - Why not? - Because I'm in it now. Besides what I'm doing is right. This is my responsibility. - Okay then go to a place called Harris Guns and see Pete Sims. Just a little 25, a first gun, you won't even know you have it. - Honey this isn't helping me, it really isn't. - Suse, I love you. I'm just worried, that's all. Suse? - I love you, Sky King. (gentle tense music) - Sure sign that a daughter loves her parents. An expensive anniversary gift. - You don't understand. My grandmother gave a bowl exactly like this to my mother for her wedding gift. When I was six there was this accident. - Oh no, you broke it. And now all these years later after a six month search you're replacing it. How utterly saccharin. - Perfect of me, isn't it? - Oh boy, postal service has gone to hell. - Subpoena. I can't get court that day. No, my parent's 50th wedding anniversary. 50. The whole family. I understand. I understand that. Can't you reschedule? Can't you at least try? I know the courts are crowded. My whole life is crowded. - Oh Suse, I'm so sorry. (door buzzes) (low tense music) - All rise. Marking 114 of the Superior Court of the State of California is now in session. The Honorable Robert Hansen presiding. Be seated, come to order. (tense music) (door buzzes) - First case to be assigned, the people versus Edward James Reeves. - [Toner] You honor. How can you continue this without the blood test, that's ridiculous because I have to seize your honor. I don't understand, how can I go to trial if I don't have the evidence that the district attorney is supposed to supply. (people chattering) (tense music) - I don't believe this. - [Judge] Next case, state of California versus Marcus Freeman. - Next case? - You're a continuant. - What? - Toner asked the judge for continuance and he granted it to him. Now listen, Susan, you're gonna have to go through this whole thing all over again. The DA did what he could to stop this but it happens. Now you'll receive a subpoena notifying you of your next court date and I want. (tense music) (gentle instrumental music) - Dan? Would you bring me a glass of water please? Dan, if this is a joke, I'm gonna clip your wings. No. (dramatic music) No! - Guess who? - No! No, no! No! No! Dan. Oh Dan. I couldn't believe the dream I just had. - [Edward] Describe it. - No! (dramatic tense music) No. (phone ringing) - Oh Suse. It's breathtaking. - Nearly broke my heart. Place owned me as soon as I saw it. - With what you pay, I would say that's an appropriate choice of words. - [Dan] Gonna need some more wood screws, girls. - Girls. - Girls. They're in the closet, would you mind? - Sure. - Thanks. - So there you go. A pro couldn't do a better job, could he? - Not bad. Like a few of your good men. - What the heck is this? - Oh, that's my old shotgun. - It's so big. - Yeah it's a 12 gauge skeet gun, I used to do some of that. - Why is it here? - Well I was going through some stuff I keep in storage, you know and, I thought I'd clean this thing up. I figured it might come in handy. - How does it work? - It's simple, really. Feed the shells in here, load it. Pump the action, you're ready to go. It's a lot like the shotguns that police use. You know, pump action like this. Asked a buddy of mine once why the cops never went to automatic weapons. He said you'd lose the sound. The wrong end of that sound is like death tapping you on the shoulder. - Susan maybe you should have something like this. - I want that thing out of here. Now, are we gonna build these shelves or not? - [Lou] You put Eddy Reeves in this place? - [Detective] Rodgers and Juvy said Reeves was picked up here about eight, nine times as a kid. If he has any friends, they're bound to be around here. - I want an undercover cop in there, pick a few names. - You gotta think, we got a bunch of monsters out there. Dudes who go through life doing the most outrageous things and we don't have a clue. - You think about something, here this woman is spending her whole time trying to get little kids to talk now somebody's trying to shut her up. Think about that. I'm gonna ring a few bells, you stay right here. - You get burned doing something like that. - I got a witness whose life is going to hell, who's looking out for her? You better stay here. - Okay. - If someone saw this picture in a magazine I'd bet they say, "Look at that girl. "Her name is Susan. "Look at that little boy. "I bet his name is Evan." You look like an Evan, don't you? I know how you feel. Sometimes I feel like sticking my hands in the sand too. Sometimes I feel like putting my whole head in the sand. - You wanna come inside for a little group work with the other kids? - Oh, no I think we're doing okay here. You might want to bring some of the other kids outside. (child whining) (soft intense music) (whining) What? (whining) Oh, no. - Congratulations, doctor. - Cory! - Yeah? - Alice said I had a phone call. - Yeah it's Mr. Tyrell, line two. - Lieutenant. Even you aren't going to ruin today for me. - I went over to Eddy Mack's part of town, I put out a strong warning. His friends should leave you alone now. - The word should inspires such confidence. - The wheels of justice may be slow, but they turn. You got a court date, Susan. - Oh, great! Alright, yeah. Bye. (cat meows) Mr. Beans, get down from there! Bad boy, bad boy! Sorry mom, sorry. Yes my new number. It's 555, no five. Okay, 8581. I just had to change it, that's all. I only have about a million people to call. Yes, they set a new trial date today. It'll all be over soon, thank god. Dan and I will set the date when we are both ready. Yes mother I know. A bird in the hand is worth a whole flock in the bush. (people chattering) - [Lou] You okay? - [Susan] Yeah I'm alright. - Good. When this is all over, lunch is on me. - Montage for dinner, something expensive. - [Prosecutor] I need to see you. - I'll see you inside. I just spoke to the lab, they said the blood tests are on their way. - They said that two weeks ago, I'm still waiting. I'm on in five minutes and I've got nothing. - You've got an eyewitness. - I gotta show that the blood in that car came from Edward Reeves, that's called physical evidence. I got no physical evidence, I got nothing. - Oh man. - You testified that after the collision you got a clear look at the driver of the vehicle that hit you. Is that correct? - Yes, sir. - Were you hurt at all? I saw pictures of the cars, it must have been a pretty nasty hit. - No. - You were just shaken up a little, I guess. - Yes sir. - Just shaken up. The police report said the suspect vehicle was over 200 feet from you when it crashed into the other cars. The man that you saw, the man that was running away, how long was his face turned toward you? - Just a couple moments. - It would sure help me ma'am, if you could be a little more specific. - Well, maybe just one second. You don't stop to look, Mr. Toner, you just see. - Yes that's right, see. You were admittedly shaken after the accident. At night, 200 feet from a man running away. That's almost 70 yards. That's nearly two thirds the length of a football field. Of course there have been some nights that I wished Jim Plunkett had nights like that. (people chuckling) (gavel pounds) - Mr. Toner. - Oh my apologies, Miss Andrews, I didn't mean anything by that. Just one last question, Miss Andrews, and then you can get down. The traffic officer who came to the scene that night, did he give you a field sobriety check? - Objection! - Sustained. - No, of course not. - No more questions, your honor. - Why would he? - Mr. District Attorney. - Your honor, we request a five minute recess to evaluate new evidence. - Thank you Miss Andrews, you may step down. Five minute recess. - You want a case? Find me the other guy in the car. - Why don't you just play the hand your dealt with and convict this guy? - Andrews says that Reeves was driving. We have blood tests here that don't match Reeves and I should have had that information two weeks ago. - Alright, they screwed up, it was an accident-- - I want you to kick tail down at that lab. - You got an eyewitness that put Reeves in the car, use her! - It's somebody else's blood. It's a junky's blood. The defense will say someone else was driving the car. You want Reeves, give me something I can work with. Right now it's over. (gentle tense music) - As much as it may pain the court to do so, I must now act upon a motion from the prosecutor and call this case and all charges against Edward Reeves dismissed. (dramatic tense music) Send out his release from custody. - It's just you and me now, baby. (soft intense music) - It's supposed to end now, Lou. That guy was supposed to go to jail and this whole thing would be over. - If we would have pressed ahead with the trial, we would have lost, and if we found more evidence, we wouldn't have been able to retry him. - I know about double jeopardy. What's supposed to happen to me now? You know what's been happening. This maniac is now set free and he knows my face, he has my address. - Believe me, by tomorrow morning this cretin won't even be in town. - Yeah but he said something to me. He said, "Just you and me now babe." - [Lou] I'm going to talk to him. - You stay the hell away from him. - Don't you tell me to stay away from him, I'm gonna talk to him. - Look, I am not gonna have any future action prejudice by you! - What do you mean prejudice by me? - [Susan] Great. - Look, it isn't always like this. You're seeing the part of the system that's slow and painful. But it does work. Hang in there. Please. - I'm gonna send some black and whites around to the apartment. I'll even come by myself. I know this is scary for you now, but I want you take it easy alright. Please, come on. (toilet flushing) Call your lawyer! File a claim! I'm with you and I'm gonna stay at you until I get you back in here another day. You go around that woman again and you're mine. (phone ringing) - Dan? - [Edward] Sure, darlin', I could be Dan. (unsettling music) - How did you get this number? This is a new number. - [Edward] I was in your apartment, that's how. I just went right in there, copied it off the phone. And I'll be coming in there again. Looking for you. (tense instrumental music) - Come on, come on. Lieutenant Tyrell please, hurry! (soft unsettling music) (tense music) - No! - Which of these is best? For meat. The regular or the serrated? - There's a man back there! Eddy Reeves, he has a knife and he's very dangerous. I want you to call-- - [Man] I don't see anything. - Please, where's your phone? Call, he's back there he might do something. He just killed seven people. - Okay, give it a try. - Guest Lock Installations at your service. That's great, it's great. Thank you. - Well I've got time for most of a shower before I leave for the airport. - Hey, what's the matter? - I'm worried you know. I feel really rotten. Going off and leaving you here all alone. - I have Mr. Beans and I have a fish, a Thai fighting fish. I'm okay. Okay. - I wish you'd keep my gun. - This is really wearing thin. - Suse, why not? - Because I'm afraid of guns, okay? Besides, if I had your gun you'd be defenseless against the Ayatollah. (door knocking) I'll get it. It's Lieutenant Tyrell. Lou, come in. - I hope this isn't too late. - No, it's alright. Dan Edwards, Lieutenant Tyrell, Lou, Dan. - [Lou] You alright? - [Susan] Yeah, do you want some coffee? - I'd love a cup, thank you very much. How you doing? Great. Well I've got one myself, but I don't dare show it in polite company. I came by myself personally to tell you that I talked to the people in the store and nobody ID'd Eddy Reeves. - Of course. How do you take it? - Oh black, thank you. - Lieutenant, is Susan safe? - As safe as anybody. I didn't see these locks. These are very good locks. - Yeah great. - I have a few (low speaking). The thing to do now is to relax, don't panic and most of all, use common sense. - In other words she should look after herself. - Dan wants me to get a gun. - Let me tell you what we got going here. We've got the cops, we've got the courts, none of it's perfect. None of it's perfect. But people start losing faith and when they start losing faith, they go out and get guns and laying booby traps and they end up hurting innocent people. You understand what I'm talking bout? - Well faith's gotta be earned, doesn't it? - Dan. - Well it does. Your faith gets broken in the cops, and the police, you gotta find another source of faith, don't you? - What does that sign say? Forget the dog, and beware of the owner. The premises is protected by Smith and Wesson. Prepare for an armed response, is that it? - No I'm talking easy answers, just personal responsibility. - Listen, Mr., I don't know anyone like Charles Bronson from Death Wish. The guy that goes out and gets a gun to protect himself, ends up shooting himself in the foot or getting some poor innocent cop killed like me. A gun is an accident waiting to happen. Leave the guns in the hands of the police. - I intend to. - [Lou] I'm sorry, I intruded your evening. - [Susan] It's alright. - [Lou] I'm gonna get ahold of Reeves so I can put a scare into him. - Yeah we'll look forward to your getting Reeves off the streets. - Count on it! I'm just a phone call away, you hear me? - Thank you. - I better get in the shower, I'm late. - Dammit! Hi big guy. Let's go see what the other kids are doing, okay? Evan? Evan! Evan stop it, Evan please! No, Evan stop. Stop, Evan please stop. Evan stop, Evan. Stop, please. - [Chris] Pulling back from you. - Chris, what you're saying is silly. - You're under enormous strain, he's almost certain to react to it. - I don't let my personal life affect the children, I've never allowed that. - I just wanted to mention it, that's all. You've worked wonders with Evan so far. - Thank you. - Maybe today was just an off day. (gentle mellow music) (tense instrumental music) - [Susan] Beans! - [Alice Voicemail] Hi, hi Suse, it's me, I'm just calling to see how you're doing. Hey listen, I'm gonna rent some movie tonight, get some popcorn, so you wanna come over? Call me. (phone beeps) - [Dan Voicemail] There's a man standing in the Bangkok International Airport who desperately wants to lick your neck. This man will be home in two days. Watch out for him, he's dangerous. (phone beeps) - [Edward Voicemail] Here kitty kitty kitty. Come on kitty, come on. - Mr. Beans? - That's a good kitty. Here kitty kitty kitty kitty. - Kitty? - [Edward Voicemail] What a pretty kitty. Come on. - Beans? - Here kitty kitty kitty. Come on kitty. - Mr. Beans? Come on Beans. Kitty? (dramatic music) Mr. Beans? Beans? Kitty? Beans? Mr. Beans. (dramatic music) - [Dispatcher] 97 one's responding, stay away. - Why don't you guys tell me how this could happen. - Come on, you gotta calm down. - I cooperated with you. I did the right thing, I did the good thing. When I need help, what do I get? This maniac is trying to kill me. He killed my cat! - I'm gonna get him. Susan, you gotta trust me, can you believe that? - Oh god. He's been in my apartment. Wash everything, my sheets, my silverware. You really can't do anything, can you? I really am all alone. - Don't believe that. Honest to god, I'm gonna do everything I can to put him in jail. I'm gonna talk to everybody, I'm gonna go through every piece of garbage until I get him in jail. - Forgive me lieutenant, if I don't wait for you. You're kidding. - Danny, it's been a while. - Susan Andrews, Pete Sims. Pete, I'm trying to fix Susan up with something she can depend on. - Why I think we can help out. Now if you're looking for something in the way of home defense, you owe it to yourself to consider one of these. - Pete, we were thinking in terms of handgun. - I know. Just a little gun shop humor. Come on over here. How about a 380? A four inch barrel, nine shot clip. - What about that one? - It's a waste of time. 25 caliber purse gun. Oh it's alright, if you wanna get up next to some guy and lay four right in his gut, but that's about all. - Pete, will you give her a break with that? - I was thinking, nine millimeter, something compact. - What's that? - It's the diameter of the bullet. Come over here. This one takes nine millimeter Parabellum bullets, that's a high velocity round with plenty of knockdown power. - Oh knockdown means that this bullet produces enough striking force to take a big man off his feet. - It's too heavy. - Well got an Israeli nine millimeter automatic. Steel frame, 14 rounds to the clip for a little extra fire power. Look, if you guys want a good revolver, I've got a beauty from Brazil. - Dan, I thought we'd just come here, get a gun. I didn't think we'd have to go through all this. - [Dan] Pete, let her see that one. - Danny, it's a 32, it's no stopping power. - Let her see it, alright? (soft instrumental music) What do you think? - What about the stopping power? - There are ways I can help that. Suse, if you're comfortable with this gun, then let's get it. You really should. - [Susan] Yeah. I guess I should. (guns firing) - Good that's it. Take a deep breath. Let it out. Still yourself. Fire! - Hardly kick at all. - That's because the bullets boom, no one more time. Come on, imagine there's a bad guy coming after you. - Oh come on. - Hey there he is, he's coming, come on. Let him have it. (guns firing) How does it feel? - Feels good. What'd you mean when you said you could help this gun? - Well when you learn how to use this thing, I'll get you a box of hollow points. - [Susan] Yeah? - Hollow point has a little hole in the tip. That way the bullet hits something and it mushrooms. - Very sexy. - Yeah, well you should see what I'm looking at. It mushrooms, you get more striking power. - Terrific, isn't that illegal? - No, you can buy them. When I was a kid, we used to make our own by knocking them with our knives. - Lovely. - Don't you think about that. You just concentrate on learning to use that gun safely. The gun you can trust. - I'm gonna miss you. - Well then marry me! You said we were gonna set the date. - I know, I know. I just need my life to settle first. Come on, come on. - Well at least you got this thing, I'll rest better. - It matters doesn't it? - Yeah, one thing about a gun, it matters. He's still coming. Empty the clip! (kids chattering) - [Susan] I bought a gun. - You really bought a gun? Your own gun? - I thought you were all for it. - Well I am I just. Can I see it? - Not in front of the kids. - You brought it here? - He's out there. Like some sort of animal. Maybe if someone could just talk to him. Scare him. - You know, you can't carry that without a license, it's illegal. - I can't just sit. (soft tense music) Hi Alice, it's me. I'm not gonna make it to the center tomorrow, okay. Oh I'm just not feeling very well. Would you tell Chris? Okay. Thanks, bye. (gentle suspenseful music) (building suspenseful music) - Boo! It's too much. What'd you do? Stake out your house until I showed up? And then you followed me? - I want you to leave me alone. - You been sniffing glue. - I want you to know you cannot do these things to me anymore. And if you try, I have got this. It is a 32 automatic and I have got nine bullets in here and I will put every last one of them into you. - You're one tough bimbo huh? That's a rush. - I want you to leave me alone. I want you to get out of my life, you bastard! - Kinda sexual, huh? I'll see you again babe, real soon. (gentle tense music) (soft unsettling music) - Susan, could I talk to you please? - I'm fine. Really. Police say it's gonna be over any day now. - I know. I trust in that. I know you have a gun now, Susan. It's all the others want to talk about. I won't ask you if it's in there. I'm assuming you have better sense than to bring it to the center. - Well I'm more than willing to make certain changes, Chris. You said it yourself, the strain I've been under is enormous. - Yes and I'm glad, relieved that you're willing to consider changes. Susan, I think you should take a leave of absence. - Chris, no. I can't stop working. I can't just leave the kids. What about Evan? - I'm letting Alice take Evan. - I'm working with Evan, we're making progress. - [Chris] Evan is regressing. He can't help but to react to what you're going through. - Oh Chris, no. - [Chris] Any child would. - Please, don't take Evan from me. - Evan perhaps more so. - Susan. - This is exactly what this maniac wants. Do you see that? He's taking everything from me and you're playing right into his hands. Do you get it? He's filling my life, he's taking everything and now. - I know what this man has been putting you through. Alright, take the time off, go away for a while, finish the dissertation. Susan I can't take the chance that Reeves might bring his vendetta here. To the center, to the children. You see that don't you? - Morning. Suse? (sobbing) - No. No. (bar rock music) - I hear you're a friend of Eddy Reeves. - [Man] I never heard of him, dude. - Get in the car. - Hey you got nothing on me! - Keep it tight, my man. You just met your nightmare. Cuff him. Get him in the car. Now the night Eddy Reeves murdered three people, he had a partner and I think he was you. - I could sue you for this, man. My lawyer's in the ACLU. - [Lou] You're under arrest for murder, pal. Your ACLU hotshot's gonna have to be very very good to beat this wrap. - You've got to be crazy, man. What do you want? Come on, I don't know who he was with! - [Lou] Give me names. Give me anyone that Eddy hung with. Start with the junkies. - You can leave a message for him at the flight operations desk. Ask him to call Susan. I called the hotel where he's supposed to be laid over but he wasn't registered. Yes. Well I appreciate you doing whatever you can, thank you. (gentle mellow music) (phone rings) Hi mom, it's me. I thought I'd come home and visit for a while. Finish the dissertation. Things have slowed down a little bit at work. Especially as I missed your anniversary, I thought I'd come home, visit. (phone beeping) - Where you been? Hansen told me you were gonna be on the-- - I called in a couple of favors so I'd get back into town. - Ride in with me, I wanna talk to you about buying that rattle trap Corvette of yours. (gentle mellow music) (phone rings) - [Susan] Hello? - [Edward] Guess who? (soft tense music) (phone rings) I haven't been able to stand it since you put your moves on me. I liked it a lot. - Leave me alone. - [Edward] What do you say I come over for a while. - Leave me alone. - [Edward] Give me what I want. (dial tone beeps) (door pounding) - Go away! (door pounding) Better be good. - Junky! They're looking for ya, Benny boy. - You're under arrest for murder. - You're going down for murder! Where is Edward Reeves? - Who? - Where's Edward Reeves? - If you cannot afford an attorney-- - Come on junky, tell me. You don't want to live with that little skinny junky boy, where's Edward? - Will be held against you. - He's not here. - Where? You tell me, he may be-- - Come here boy! - The girl. - What? - He went for the girl. - Get up! (soft ominous music) (tense instrumental music) (gun firing) (gentle instrumental music) - [Susan] Dan! - You shot the wrong guy, babe. Guess what's gonna happen next. - I don't have to guess, I know. (police chattering) Alright, let's go. - Does it still hurt? - You guys got me so high, I won't feel anything for a week. - You'll thank me. It's cut up pretty bad, it looks like hollow point. - Come on, let's give them-- - Hey look I'm sorry. We got him stabilized, you wanna ride to the hospital? - No wait wait. Give me the gun. - I don't want the gun anymore. - Give me the gun. - It's okay. (soft instrumental music) - I'm right there baby. - We got a solid case. We're gonna be charging him with the murders and that's the end. - No, no. - Wait. They still want you to testify. Will you? - Oh yes. Oh yes. (people chattering) (ambulance siren blaring) (mellow peaceful music) (MultiCom Jingle)
