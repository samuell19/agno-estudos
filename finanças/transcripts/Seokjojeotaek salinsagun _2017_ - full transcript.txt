We charge the accused, Nam Do-Jin for murdering a man named Choi Seung-Man on the night of Oct. 22nd last year. The police went to the crime scene after a report call from an eyewitness and found the trace of incineration of a mutilated body at the incinerator in basement as well as a part of a finger which seems to be the victims. The police arrested the suspect who was at the scene. Freeze! Police! Directed by JUNG Sik and Kim Hui Your honor, there is a saying of the court. Your honor, there is a saying of the court. There's no conviction without a body. It does sound right at first but an important word is missing in that sentence. Which is the evidence. It'd be more accurate to say there's no conviction without any evidence of a body I would like to submit this as the evidence. The Tooth and the Nail SEOUL - 1945 Can I borrow some money for a taxi? I'll pay back for sure... 1 won would do, I beg you. Thank you, sir. Now return my bags. Are you kidding, young lady? This is way little! You said I was short of 1 won. And here it is. Listen, lady. Do you know how much I wasted waiting for you? It's way too little! Not even close! Have a sense of conscience! You're asking too much. Taking two bags for only 1 won? Do you want to be in a serious trouble? Then please give me this. I really need this. Please, sir. Damn! Let go of me! - I said let go! - I cannot! - Let go! - Can this work? There must be some gold inside. Thank you. I guess you came a long way. Do you have a place to go? Pardon? I'm asking if you got a place to stay. Well, listen. I am grateful you helped me. And it was me who asked for the help first. But if you had other intentions lending me the money... You mean this? See? Now you do me a favor, please. You might be frostbitten. Oh, I left that in the car... As you can see, this is a real gun. Who would kill me? No one? Beautiful lady over there. Come up here, please. What's your name? Ha-Yeon. Jeong Ha-Yeon. Ha-Yeon. What you'll do is to just pull the trigger at my signal. Everyone! Count three! Three. Two. One and shoot! It doesn't fire. No way. Try once again. - It's not working. - Pull it harder. Harder, you should... - Oh my god! - Is he really shot? He seems not dead. - He's getting up! - Marvelous! I was startled a bit but I had fun. By the way... is Abdullah Lee your real name? Of course not. My name is Seok-Jin. Lee Seok-Jin. You are a young gentleman. I'm not sure... if I can ask you this. - Go ahead. That gun magic. How did you do it? You make a guess. The gun must be fake... If the magic were that easy... You made the gun not fire for the first three times, right? So it doesn't blow for three times and bang from the fourth! Just stop right there. I paid a lot for this trick. I should get going. Thanks for everything. I was so helpless... but I could avoid the cold and enjoyed the magic thanks to you. Where are you going? The sun would rise soon. So long. Wait, Ha-Yeon! How about sharing my room? Pardon? I work until this hour every day. The room is empty during the night. So I can sleep during the day and you sleep there at night. - But... - Now that I've met you I can't let you go like this in this cold winter. I would feel guilty for doing that. Then only until I get the job I'll accept your favor. I'm so sorry. Don't expect too much. It's a hotel only on the outside. I don't look like it but I'm a poor man. Let's go. Right, I forgot! - Warmer than they seem, right? - Yes, they are. I feel like being a magician in these shoes. JULY 15TH, 1948 THE 1ST HEARING OF STONE MANSION MURDER CASE Who called you? - Pardon? - The man who reported this case. Telling he heard a gunshot and saw the body through the window of the basement. I don't know. Not a clue? He hung up after saying that. In most murder cases, witnesses are afraid of the retaliation... But this all started with that telephone call. And the police haven't verified this person's identity yet? Let's talk about this finger. When you found this were there other parts? What other parts? Other parts of the body. For example, the head or the organs of Choi Seung-man? Or at least pool of blood? He burnt them all. There was nothing left. You say as if you saw him burning. I did not but... - the circumstance is... - Circumstance! Right on point! Your testimony is only circumstantial. Your thoughts on how it must've happened, right? But we've got the evidence. The definite evidence that a person was killed! What definite evidence? You mean this finger? Then let me ask you one last question. You believe a man would die if one of his fingers is cut? Will you die if a finger is cut? Objection, your honor! He's forcing the witness the assumption! It's the prosecution who forces the assumption. We need the witness or the corpse or the motive of the crime for the least to establish a murder case. But the prosecutor cannot present any of these. It's not the attorney's job to judge the evidence. I would like to remind you that we have shown yet less than 10% of the evidence. I cannot wait to see those evidence myself. Again! Are you a vampire or what? Why do you crawl into it at every night! Hey, who is that bitch? Why did she steal your room? Do you owe her money? How dare you call her bitch? Did you knock her up? - Gosh! - You bastard. Can a nomad magician afford that? I'm already worried about the slow business. Don't do this to me. Wait! Shall we hire one more staff? You said you need a girl in the kitchen. I said we're losing customers! Stop staring at her! You'll make a hole in her face. Okay, isn't she? Listen, lady. Aren't you good at anything? Pardon? Not really... Why do you need a specialty for a kitchen staff? Do you really want this beauty to work in the kitchen? I have a better idea. Dancing is all about feet. The steps. Come here. Yes, right foot first. Step forward. Four... - Three. - Three. - Two. - Two. - One. - One. - Get in. - Yes. I never thought the stage would be that frightening. Only at the beginning. I made many mistakes at first. When you first became a magician? No, way before that. I worked at the circus when I was this little. Circus? You know being a clown... is very sad. You clown around wearing a loud make-up. But after the show no one recognizes you. And you constantly wander around in the cold and the hunger. Why didn't you just quit? I couldn't. - Why? - I was sold to them. After my parents died a man came and took me. And he sold me to the circus the next day. Only for 10 wons, gosh. Ready? Come out and stand together. How do you like it? Beautiful. Exactly what I imagined. But your skirt is too... Right? I thought that too. - It's too long. - Shor... It must be up here. Hey, get closer! Right, much better. Are you sure? It shows your thighs. Strike a pose! Why? What? Are you worried or jealous? You really don't know? Envy you. Stunning! Rock, paper, scissors! - Wait, please! - Wait, sir. It's pretty. - Don't even think about it! - But it's beautiful! Let's go, come on! I like it! Ta-da! I love you. JULY 22ND, 1948 THE 2ND HEARING OF STONE MANSION MURDER CASE I will show the evidence you analyzed. Please explain, doctor. It's the index finger of an adult man. It was cut by a sharp object and left in the water at least for an hour. DOCTOR JANG JI-HO, 45 FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST What is the blood type of this? Type A. What did you find in the sewer of the boiler room? Along with dust, grime and resin, we found the human blood. Could you figure out the blood type? Type A. It's an adze found in the basement. There is lots of blood on it. - Was it the human blood? - Yes. - Blood type? - Type A. You know what is in this bottle. The ash sample collected at the boiler room. Along with cinder and wood ashes, I detected lots of animal protein. No further questions. That animal protein you mentioned, can you list all the living things containing that? - All? - Yes. All of them. Humans... and... dogs, pigs, cows, foxes... lambs, goats, raccoons, moose... Thank you, doctor. That's enough. So among 4 types of blood of human beings - which is the rarest? - Type O. - And the most common is? - Type A. I see. I'm a type A too. How about you? Type A myself. Thank you. No further questions. Ha-Yeon... The Japanese leaving Korea smuggles assets out of country. - Boo! - Gosh! You scared me! You seem so focused. What are you reading? How was the meeting? - Busan? - Yes, your hometown. - Isn't it great? - Yes, but... we're doing a good business here. That's how we do this business. As people get bored of a long-run show eventually... Are you taking me with you? Of course, I am. Why? You don't want to go? I do but just... By the way, who was she? Who? I saw you earlier from the tram. She didn't seem ordinary. I saw you handing her something. Oh... She dropped something so I returned it to her. Let's have good shows in Busan and get to the bigger stage when we come back. Why isn't he coming? I wanted to say good-bye in person. Let's go. We might miss the train. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Seok-Jin! Ha-Yeon! I wish you the best. Glad we could at least see him. Do not worry a thing. We'll do just fine there. ROMANTIC MAGICIAN ABDULLAH LEE IN BUSAN! Are you alright? I'll manage myself for a while. Go to see a doctor tomorrow. Yes. - She is sick! - It's none of my business! Missing the show calling sick? I will deduct it from the salary! Damn son of a bitch! Hey, Mr. 603! A man left this for the lady. I believe you've kept the copperplateâ€™s safe. Will call to the lobby at 11 PM tonight. Copperplate? Must be a wrong delivery. Hey. I went to the club earlier to talk to you. - You know... - Explain this to me. Aren't these... the plates for the fake bills? Why are these in your bag? Jeong Ha-Yeon. Why do you keep such things? Tell me. Because the person who made them is my uncle. Your uncle? For what? I didn't plan to hide it from you. I was just too scared because of the Japanese. What Japanese? What do you mean? Tell me from the beginning. Okamoto... His name was Okamoto Shigeroo. He came to my uncle, who was a chalcographer. Who was it? Uncle? He paid my uncle a big sum and discreetly ordered something. OKAMOTO SHIGEROO and discreetly ordered something. Not after a long while... Uncle! My uncle was murdered. Oh, no. And I saw it was the same man who'd come to see my uncle. Okamoto Shigeroo. Japanese detective named Abe Masayoshi came to investigate the case. He didn't give a damn about my uncle's death. He only wanted to know where the copperplates were. Even after the liberation, Abe often visited my house asking for the copperplates. When I found the copperplates that my uncle hid I understood why they were so eager to find them. What about this letter? It's him. Okamoto. He hasn't left the country. I should've thrown them away. From the very beginning. Calm down, will you? Calm down. You did it well. They should've hurt you even if you'd given them. I'm sorry. - I am so sorry. - No. We should not be involved in this. We can't keep them anymore. Let's give them to him and leave. Wait here. I'll try to talk to him. Do you remember the man who left the letter? How could I? So many people come and go. But he looked like he is loaded. The hat and coat... looked good on him. He was tall and fabulous. I wish I were him. You're that magician! Right? Abdullah Lee! She's... dead. No, she is murdered. JULY 27TH, 1948 THE 3RD HEARING OF STONE MANSION MURDER CASE Where did you get these two fingerprints? The right one is from the cut finger. INSPECTOR LEE TAE-HO, 37 POLICE FORENSICS DIVISION The right one is from the cut finger. The left one is from Choi's driver's license. What's your opinion on these two fingerprints? They match at least for 99%. Thank you. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Anything you want to talk? I can give you a bargain to a life sentence. The life sentence? And you call it a bargain? I decline. - If you want a reduced... - Listen, prosecutor Song. My experiences tell that this is an all-or-nothing case. Death penalty or innocent. It sounds like you want to gamble on your client's life. How could the judge take this as the murder case when there is no corpse? The law never presumes the death. We have tons of evidence other than the finger, so don't worry. Why should I worry about the case with no witness, no corpse and no motivation? You think we didn't find out the motive of the murder. To commit a torso murder and burn the corpse, one must hold a big grudge. But there are no hard feelings between them. So Nam will walk out innocent with lack of evidence. Is this what you think? Whatever you want to guess. There can be thousands of reasons other than the grudge to kill. And we can think of something if necessary. Can we call the accused to the stand as planned? I don't know what your strategies are. Are you waiting for the accused to make a false confession? I'll be more than happy if he does so. A single government? Who approved it? Fake bills' circulation increased amidst the disarray. Fake bills' circulation increased amidst the disarray. What a shamble we have! Did you know that your wife was pregnant? Bug off! Don't play your drunken frenzy here! Don't you dare to come again! Damn it. You didn't have to kill her. Okamoto. Okamoto Shigeroo. He mustn't have returned to Japan. The copperplates are for forging bills of Bank of Korea. I need to find Abe Masayoshi. He might be the only one letting me know about Okamoto or he can be Okamoto's accomplice. He was preparing to leave for Japan selling his stuffs and house. Excuse me, but what brings you here? I'm here to meet Abe Masayoshi. Have you made an appointment? I think I haven't seen you before. Take me to Abe! If you go back now, you'll be safe. - Shut up! Do you want to die? I'll ask you only once. Who sent you here? Okamoto Shigeroo! What? The copperplate for the fake bills... Why do you want to meet him? To kill that bastard! Kill Okamoto? But if that's the real reason, you've come to a wrong person. We ordered the copperplates and paid for them. But Okamoto who was the agent got everything and ran away. He even killed the chalcographer! If you can find him, go ahead. I'll let you go. How can we trust him? There's not a single picture of him. The only thing standing out is that he's fluent in many languages. Chinese, Japanese, English and even German. Few Koreans are like that. What? Is he Korean? Didn't know? He's Korean. And one more thing! He was always with a woman. He was really into her. Start searching from Seoul. Seoul is the only city big enough to circulate the fake bills. Advice from a former detective. Let him go. You should pay us back for letting you live? What have you done with this gun? I fully loaded it. Use them wisely. AUGUST 7TH, 1948 THE 4TH HEARING OF STONE MANSION MURDER CASE OFFICER, LEE JIN-WOO, 30 JONG-RO POLICE STATION This is the gun. Was the magazine full when you found it? It's a six-shooter and there was one bullet left. It's the first bullet you found at the scene. Where did you find it? At the head of the bed. Did you find only one bullet? No, one in the stair railings. One each in the wall and the floor of the living room. - And... - And... Last one in the incinerator. Yes, total five were found at the scene. Thank you for everything. - May I ask you one thing, sir? - What? On the rug under your feet, something is written, right? Well, yes. So what? A young gentleman looked at it and laughed so hard. Did he? So I'm wondering if you can tell me what it says. No... if it's Japanese, I could... it looks like English... Hey, you! You think you can read it? I was so sure. If you are a man with an endless supply of money... you can never say no to the alcohol and women. I had to become a clown again. He might remember my face from my performances with Ha-Yeon. And I got a night shift job at a taxi company. I bribed the touts of Seoul's luxurious clubs so that they could pick rich clients for me saying I want to be a chauffeur of a rich family. I drove many rich men and more fake rich men but nobody could read the German on the rug. I had to burn the large bills. As the fake bills would burn with the green spark. So I could never make my daily quota thus was threatened of being fired every day. But what tenured me the most was the lapse of time. Time increased the distance between me and my revenge and almost erased the pain of losing her. That's how you do that trick? Gosh, it's too easy. Yes, it's easy. It just hides what is seen while showing the unseen. Do you remember when you gave me the ring? You told me something but I don't remember it. I didn't want to forget the time we spent together. Not a single moment. Didn't you miss me, Seok-Jin? Of course, I did. Every moment. Happy to hear that. Why aren't you looking back at me? 'Cause I know you're not there. If I look back I'll see you are not there... AUGUST 11TH, 1948 THE 5TH HEARING OF STONE MANSION MURDER CASE What did you do at the mansion? OH SOON-IE, 19 HOUSEMAID I did the housework twice a week. Cleaning and the laundry... You have an episode to tell us, don't you? The story you wrote in your statement. There was a call a few days before the accident. From a Japanese man called Okamoto. Any special reason for you to remember that call? I talked about the phone call... To the accused? Yes. Then his face suddenly got stiff. Did he mention his trip before that phone call? No, he didn't. And as soon as he heard about it, he prepared his trip. - That's right. - Objection, your honor. - No further questions, thank you. We're here, sir. Gosh... What are you doing, sir? Why do you go through his wallet... I have a client waiting... Sir. Which direction should I take from the crossroad ahead? I'm new to this part of city... Where did you get this rug? Pardon? Do you even know what it says? "When you go to the toilet, pull the handle when you finish." It means 'Flush after you shit.' Keep the change. Thank you so much, sir. Welcome! Oh, you're here. Wait a bit. Are you having a good time? Yes! The real show will begin soon but I can't help but notice the great allied force is bored. Hey guys! As loyal Korean... I wanna say, I thank you... for--for our liberation. Let the real show begin! One... two... three... See you next time! - It's so cold! - It was fun! He will bring her his home. Understood? He's coming. Sir! I have long waited this day to come. I finally got the chance to face him and put the bullet in his head... to end my long wait for the revenge. THE 5TH HEARING AUGUST 11TH, 1948 Be seated! You rode the taxi with the accused when he met Choi Seung-man for the first time. Correct? Yes. HONG SE-HEE, 21 HOSTESS AT CHUNHEE HALL And did you spend the night at his mansion? Yes, I did. Tell us what you witnessed. While leaving the house in the morning I saw them talking at the front door. Choi begged all through the ride to hire him as chauffeur the night before. He didn't seem to mean it telling Choi to come back. But Choi turned up the next morning. I brought all the documents as you said, sir. My birth certificate and the proof of employment. I am sorry but... I spoke amiss last night because I was a bit drunk. Let's forget the chauffeur thing. What do you mean, sir? Take this as an apology. Go ahead. I don't care about petty money. I believed your promise and quit my job already! My goodness... This can't be true! Didn't it seem if Choi approached him on purpose? He did seem... too persistent. You took the bread out of my mouth, - He mentioned about police. - I should go to the police. Hey! Let's get inside and talk. No further questions, thank you. So we have one witness left? Yes, your honor. Prosecutor Song, come close. Are you sure about this? He will surely testify against you. I have no other choice. He is the only eyewitness for now. Alright, then. Continue. I am calling the accused to the stand. Sir... I am tired of driving taxi. I'll give it a thought if you can commute. But moving around here would cost quite a lot... It's none of my business. Please spare me mercy, sir. You never know when you would need a car. And... I can do other errands. Are you an orphan? Yeah, it happened somehow. Well, I guess you might be useful. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you! I'm grateful, sir. I will offer my best service. By the way... may I ask your name? Why ask? I should at least know my master's name. My name is Nam Do-Jin. Sir Nam. Do. Jin. And yours? You don't have to know your servant's name, sir. Choi... Seung-man? It's Seung-man. Choi Seung-man. Please call me Choi, sir. Your statement says you met Choi for the first time that night. Let me ask again since you take the stand now. Did you really meet Choi for the first time that night? Have you not known him before? Answer me! You knew Choi before, didn't you? No, I didn't. Then you hired him on a whim like that? I was thinking about hiring a chauffeur anyway. I felt sorry for him as he seemed a bit dull. I felt a responsibility that he lost his job too. Wasn't it because he was going to the police? No way. It must be a misunderstanding. Yes... We can all misunderstand. However... the suspicion about your fortune cannot be misunderstood. How could you accumulate such wealth? Objection, your honor! The defendant's accumulation of his wealth or its size is irrelevant to this case. The accused doesn't have a decent enterprise nor source of income. Considering the motive of most homicides are either resentment or money issues, this is a relevant issue. Please proceed. Answer me, Mr. Nam Do-Jin. How could you accumulate that much of wealth without a decent enterprise nor a source of income? You cannot answer or you will not? Then let me rephrase the question. Choi did know the secret of your fortune, didn't he? And that is why you killed him! Your honor! This is not a questioning but an interrogation! - I request the court to adjourn! - Answer me, Mr. Nam! No, you don't have to! Do not answer him! You don't have to be worried. The prosecutor has no other means but shouting. Well, do I look worried now? You're doing just great. The prosecutor will keep trying to provoke you. He waits for your slip of tongue as this is a case without evidence. I used this method quite a lot when I was a prosecutor. By the way... Didn't they say there's an eyewitness? The initial reporter. No worries about that, either. If they had one he must've been brought. Well... Fair enough. But you should be prepared for the issue around your property. What do you mean? Once they've found fault with it you will not be able to keep your illegal fortune intact. Illegal? Feel free to find out if I have any criminal records. Mr. Nam. I am not interested in your past. I don't care if you really killed Choi Seung-man. As long as I serve as your attorney you are innocent to me. Then... What shall I do now? Consolidate your property first. Keep some cash in case we're going for the settlement. Then? Please settle the balance of my fee as soon as possible. Please don't be offended. You can allege your innocence only when I stay as your attorney. Good. Suit yourself. I couldn't be satisfied like that. The desire to kill the bastard surged up when I found him. But I should restrain myself. He didn't deserve the peace of a sudden death. So I changed my plan. I wanted to take away what he'd earned unlawfully and to witness his miserable collapse. So I had to find the means to destroy him more painfully. Choi! Yes, sir! He entrusted the plates to a printer and shared the profit with him. Madame Sung helped him traffic fake bills to high-rank officials. I couldn't know exactly who they were. Because he didn't deal with them directly. Let's go. Feel free to check. They turned out brilliant. From now on, I'll take 50%. I can't even pay for the papers with 20%. Remember to whom the plates belong? It's not easy for me, either. I should print them my ass off after my employees go home. Anyway, divide in half. I see Mr. Kim got a point. I should raise my fee, too. Don't you think so, Mr. Kim? Of course! You should. Sir. There was a call for you in the morning. From whom? It was Okamoto something... What? Right, Okamoto Shigeroo. He said you'd know the name. What did he say further? He wanted to talk to you so I asked who he was. Then he just giggled and said that name before he hung up. Is it someone you know? No, not at all. Okamoto... I have clients waiting. Say it quickly. We clear up the business and leave here. As soon as possible. Someone knows who I am. What are you talking about? There was a call looking for Okamoto Shigeroo. To my house. You thought you'd never be traced? Great. Let's leave. That's what I want. But when? As soon as you get the plates back. Do it yourself if you want them back. I won't do it. I can't. Do you really think Kim would give them back to you? Do you really think I am asking you? Only you and I know about Okamoto. Right? Then you're threatening? You threatening me? Do you think I turned my back against you after all this? Too much money should've allured the smart brain of yours? You'd better look around carefully before picking on me. Think what's been changed. Sir, did you call for me? Find someone to check the boiler. Better have it checked before it gets cold. And have the car examined, too. Are you going on a trip, sir? No, I'm just arranging. - Let me do it for you, sir. - No, it's okay. Let me do it myself. Go ahead and do your job. BIRTH CERTIFICATE This son of a bitch... THE 5TH HEARING AUGUST 11TH, 1948 You left the house in the morning on the day of the murder to go for a trip. Is it correct? Yes. Why did you return that night while you were supposed to go for three days? No special reasons. There was a heavy storm... Where was your destination? I was going to meet a friend I knew for business. Mr. Okamoto? Never heard that name. Was it for your... mysterious business? Objection, your honor! Abstain from emotional expressions. Let's return to this suspicious trip. What did you do for the whole day? Your honor, this is about the accused's privacy subject to the lawful protection. Choi Seung-man was left alone on that day because of this trip. It is very important to find out if the trip was premeditated. Moreover, the accused remains silent on his whereabouts since he left the house till he returned. You can carry on. Thank you, your honor. What is the name of the friend you were going to meet? Do you want me to falsely confess that I killed Choi Seung-man? Answer only to the question! I am asking what you've done and where you've been before returning home. I already submitted my statement. Listen. You exercise your right to remain silent? Why did I have to kill Choi? Why on earth! Do you know? Then enlighten me why I had to kill him. My motive of the murder. Your honor. It is beyond my understanding why we should go on like this. The prosecution pressed the charge by force and forces the accused the false testimony! This is a threat! We refuse the further statement. I announce the court to adjourn. Your honor! The attorney is claiming nothing wrong. I can't help but dismiss the selection of witness. Haven't you found him yet? The initial reporter claiming he saw the body. Remember I'd have to dismiss the indictment unless you have an unfailing witness or evidence. It's not easy to fabricate the case, is it? Sir! Read it. Pardon? Read, I said. Well... at 10PM call 8500. "I got the copperplates. Don't look for them..." Assume that you called 8500. Say it. Sir? Show me how you will say it. I got the copperplates. No, not like that. In a deeper voice, like you really mean it. Do it again. I got the copperplates. Don't look for them anymore. Good, you do great. Then you hang up. Understood? Why don't you take me if you're away for three days? Stay home, You have other things to do. Connect me to 8500, please. Hotel Hong-shin, is it? Room 301, please. What? This isn't a hotel. Where is it then? It's a printing factory, a very busy one, for god's sake! - We go home first then. - Did you finish it up? - Yes, sir. - Go ahead, then. - Good night, sir. - Good night, sir. - See you tomorrow. - Good night. Who the hell is it at this hour? Hello. I got the copperplates, don't look for them anymore. What? It can't be... Hello, it's me. You got the plates safe, right? Go check, right now! No, it's just... I got a strange phone call. What's all this about? You don't have them here? Yes, sir. Mr. Choi Seung-man? Yes, speaking. It's been a while, Mr. Magician. I just did what that bitch told me. She has the plates, you know? She told me to call you... I don't even know who the hell Okamoto is, believe me! Listen! I'll behave, please! Give me a chance, Mr. Nam! You should've listened to me. Funny how he played a smart ass when he had a tiger under his nose. Don't you agree? Mr. Lee Seok-Jin? I have an excellent memory. As far as it goes with men's faces. It's a professional instinct. Since when did you know? Does he know, too? What do you think? Say it unless you want to die now! Let go of... me! Whatever your plan is... if I scream now, it would go up in smoke! I have a proposal for you. I will help you. Kill Nam Do-Jin for me. You know what they are? Take them. Nam will chase you down even if you don't want it. You are not his woman? No way. I am not his woman. In the past and even now he has only one woman. Jeong Ha-Yeon. Such a fool. Think about it. Why didn't she throw them away if she ran away from him? Why did she keep them while living with you? Because Nam entrusted the copperplates to her. They promised to meet again when the Japs took off. What are you talking about? - Ha-Yeon was... - Do you think you know her? Ha-yeon worked for me. God how she played excellently being an innocent girl. Especially the story of her uncle with dementia? That even made me cry, who knew it was a made-up bullshit. Stop saying nonsense! We didn't know where she was. We were on the run, too. When I found her in Seoul and came for her with Nam you were already left for Busan. Nam had no intention to kill her. He just planned to distract you to bring her back. Well, she got pregnant. A child of another man! Shut up! Ha-Yeon couldn't have loved such a bastard! She was frightened that night. Did you know that? Why would I lie to you at this point? You think you knew her? She even gave me a letter. Can you guess what she wrote? That she still loved Nam Do-Jin? Or she found another love so not to find her again? Better be prepared for the truth you'll find out soon. Where are the copperplates? Make your choice. You leave with me giving up the plate or... you will end up dead. Bring me the copperplates! I am truly sorry but... I don't have them anymore. I had a secret man behind your back. He is more than willing to kill you. Did you... give them to my chauffeur? That Choi Seung-man bastard? So you put the rat in my house! You crazy bitch! Can we please go back? To when you loved me? It's all because of that bitch! Ha-yeon took you away from me. It was because of her, wasn't it? Both of you live in your own fantasies. Not a minute... I've never loved any of you. Do you know why I killed Ha-Yeon? Because she knew me like you know me. You will die tonight. THE 6TH HEARING SEPTEMBER 20TH, 1948 I will call a new witness to the stand. Well... objection, your honor. We were not informed of it. A new witness? I have not heard about... We found him. The initial reporter. Call the new witness. Your name and the reason why you've decided to testify. My name is Lee Seok-Jin. I witnessed the murder and made the report that day. We cannot trust his testimony. It was raining hard with thunder. An ordinary person couldn't have recognized the gunshot. Mr. Lee has performed the gun magically more than 100 times. He has of course heard the gunshot numerous times. Is the witness' profession a magician? Yes, it was. Please take off your hat at the stand. Why didn't you step forward sooner? I was afraid of the retaliation. You son of a bitch. Are you that... magician? I can see it now. Your honor! He is Choi Seung-man. That bastard is Choi Seung-man. Gosh... what are you talking about? The finger... let them check his finger! The finger! We ask your permission to check the witness' finger, your honor. Proceed. Please take off your glove, the right hand. Can I put it back? Crazy son of a bitch. Your hand... when did it happen? There was an accident while practicing a new trick. My hand meltdown in the hot steam. The medical certificate by the doctor who operated him and the statement by the owner where the accident happened. It's all lies! That prick! He made it all up! - We are all being fooled! - I request the removal of the accused for the smooth proceeding of the hearing. You crazy bastard! You tried to kill me first! Tell the truth! Say it now! You'd better give up if you're waiting for Sung. She's not coming. You should've gone with these. What a fool you've been to trust a woman. I want to ask you one thing. Be my guest. But... I'm not sure if you'd tell the truth... The truth? Who are you? You know why I've left you alive? Better be prepared for the truth you'll find out soon. What is that? Who the hell are you? Thanks for your service, Choi. Guess you've got no time to read it. You bastard! Son of a bitch! Die! Die! Then... how can you explain your presence here? According to you, Choi is a crazy man who tried to kill you. And you're saying he didn't kill you after knocking you down? And now he shows up as the witness against you. Do you think it makes sense? Please explain. Why Mr. Lee does such thing to you? What are you to him? What on earth did you do to him? You bastard. This is what you're after... He's after what? Give us your explanation. Your honor. - For disturbance in court... - I will! That son of a bitch! That bastard...! Die! What shall I do... What shall I do, Ha-yeon? Tell me... Please talk to me. Sometimes I think... of all the people in the world getting to meet you and falling in love with you... all these might be the magic practiced by someone. Because it is this easy. Hiding what is seen while showing the unseen... that's my magic. For you for you and me only from now on I want to show you only what you want to see by your side forever. I am who you see and who you think I am. I love you.
