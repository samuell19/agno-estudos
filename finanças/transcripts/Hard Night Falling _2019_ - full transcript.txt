Gentlemen. Our treasure is untouched. The most expensive, privately owned collection of rare coins is still ours. Rossini Enterprises has based its business on this collateral that has allowed us to become as rich as we are today. There is no Wall Street collapse or economic crisis that will ever undermine its value. We're running out of time. We're always ready. Copy. I have everything you need. I hope so. You already confirmed delivery. They're all inside. You can count them if you want. No problem. I trust you. Quit! Drop it. I said, drop it. This is why I always carry two. Now walk. Walk. Walk. Stop. Drop the guns or I kill him! I said, drop the guns or I kill him! Walk back. Walk. You drive. Thanks. You're welcome. Drop the weapon. Interpol. Can I show you my badge? Where is it? Back pocket. Are you gonna stay there for a while? - Okay. There. - Can I relax now? Yeah. You just screwed up a joint operation to capture an international network of arms dealers. The screw-up comes from your office. We haven't been briefed. Are we free to go? Are we free to go? Let me. May I? Yeah. Well, they're not gonna be selling any more guns. We'll never get to their supplier. What about the clients who bought the gun stuff? We should debrief before you go. I'll write my report tomorrow. I've got a marriage to save. And... And? My daughter's gonna be there. I didn't know you had a daughter. Yeah. I haven't seen her for quite some time now. Quite some time. All right. Uh, how do I look? Handsome. Well, good luck with your wife. And your daughter. Do you always go to parties like this? Once in a while. Part of my business. Fell two floors. Beg your pardon. Mary. You look lovely as always. Who's your friend? Diana, my husband's daughter. And Gabriele. Gabriele Damiani. So nice to make your acquaintance. Is Michael joining us tonight? Maybe. Yeah, right. He's working as usual. I haven't seen my father in four years, and he still can't make it in time. Diana. Well, I will see you later. I've been told that Gabriele has been hovering around. If that's hovering, I'm terrified what a full-scale attack would be. Handsome, wealthy, single. What's the problem? I'm married. You're separated. Meaning, go check if the grass is greener on the other side. You and Michael got married way too young. - Enjoy this while you can. Ah. Speak of the devil. What excuse will it be this time? Hi, Michael. Yeah. Diana's here. - Do you think security can let him in? - Do I have to? Sara. Okay. Yeah, she's right on it. See you soon. Bye. Mary. Hi. Wow, you look great. And you look pretty good yourself. So... So where's-- where's Diana? Hi, Diana. Oh. Hmm... Wow, you're--Dad, I missed you so much. Yeah, I missed you too. It's silly of me.It's not silly. It's not silly missing your dad. It's all right. Don't worry. I just wish we could see each other more. Yeah, me too. Me too. Hey, sorry I was late. I got held up at work. Look at you. Wow, you look beautiful. What happened? You grew up. You got so big. Let me see. My pet. Yes. You're gonna be my little girl.Shall we? Okay, let's go. Let's check it out. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have a moment of your attention. After two years of strong sales, continued expansion... Wait. How old are you now? What are you, 12? No, 24? She's 29. I can safely say that we have emerged out of the crisis. Thank you. Rossini Industries is investing heavily in new technologies to stay well ahead of these important trends. Please, sir.Sorry. Madam. I'm sorry. Excuse us. Sorry. Like every one of us, I like to see... some profits of our enterprises. But on one condition: respecting the world we live in. Respect for the environment, the people, plants, and animals that live on this beautiful planet. This is a major concern of mine and of our enterprises. Come in. Let's go. Come on, come on. What's going on? Sit down! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My apologies for the interruption. My men and I are going to be here for a few hours. We expect your full cooperation. What do you want? You, come here. Me? She stays with me! You're in no position to bargain, no matter how much you love your daughter. Miss Sara Rossini, please. How did you know? Who told you? I'm going to ask all of you to follow my men upstairs. You'll be divided in groups of ten and kept as prisoners until the end of the operation. Let's go. It's fine. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Stop. Copy. Diana. Let's go. Leave him. I'm a doctor. I'm a soldier, and it suits me to see him die. You bastard. Thank you. You go upstairs with the others. Take him away. How do you know about this room? Ah! Give me your phone. Give me your phone! Come on. Come on! Go. Dad. Look. You screwed it up already? Scott. You have to get the team down to the Rossini villa, ASAP. We've got a hostage situation. Details? What's going on? Fifteen to 20 armed men. About 50 hostages. We need backup. No. Mary's in there. What about your daughter? She's with me. Copy that. With you in 20 minutes. Okay. We're gonna have to get you safe first. You have to go by yourself. Yes.Go to the village. Where's your cell phone? I lost my purse. Okay. All right. Here's some money. Go down, find a hotel, a restaurant. Call me when you get there. All right? Okay. Okay, here we go. So... You'll be fine, all right? Okay? Okay. Talk to you soon. Lock the perimeter. Stop. Goro. Two are fucking down. Did you find the keys? No, sir. Stop! Move! Come on! I said move! You stay back. Be gentle. Doctor? Feeling like saving someone? I prefer no women dying in this operation. We need a flat surface. The kitchen should do. - Kitchen? - Yes. Can you get your men to help me? Okay. Go.Yes, sir. All right, listen up. The doors are rigged with explosives. And don't even try the windows. Step outside and you're dead. Do you understand? Do we have an understanding? Yeah? Have I made myself clear? Yeah? Good. She's been shot. What's happened? You've been shot. Oh... You're bleeding. Am I going to die? No. Not if we can get the bullet. Knives, alcohol, sharp scissors, and lots of towels, lots and lots of towels. Yes, of course. I've done it many times. You're going to be all right. I've done this lots of times. We found Ho-jin by the door, Eito and Ki-nam out on the perimeter. But Ho-jin's weapon is missing and the police might be on the way. We knew we'd have to deal with them at some point. But who is he? Don't know. No idea. Not on the list. Last-minute arrival. I'd like to find out for whom he works. Come on. Sir? Cop car coming up solo. Good evening, officers. Bianchi? Bianchi? Take him in. Hide the cars. Maybe more cops are coming. Yeah? Dad? Are you okay? Yeah, I found the hotel. Okay, great. I love you. Dad? Yeah? Get Mary.I will. Here. Bianchi? You are going to get us killed. I don't think there's a sniper allocated to our windows. A bluff.Are you sure? Pretty sure. I don't like "pretty." We can't wait for them to kill us all, can we? They would have already done it if they wanted to. Not sure. So that's what you came for? How do I open it? Sara! The code! I don't have it. How am I to believe this? One hostage. What are you doing? A test. They're going to kill us one by one. Do you enjoy killing? Yes. We can keep on for quite a while, but maybe... Maybe you will be more receptive if your daughter's life is at stake. Ten. Nine. Eight.Dad! Seven. Six. Five.All right! Stop. J-D... W-K... 89-54-A-S. I've been briefed that... I need three keys to open the vault. You had one. The other two are in Singapore and in Paris. But not today.I don't know who has them. We have been preparing for a scenario like this. I know, but you do have information that those scumbags you call shareholders may want to trade for a few coins. Look. I'll give you 10 million if you walk away right now. Ten million? Yes. Wait, wait. There is 150 under our feet. Untraceable. Thank you. No. No, thanks. Take them off. I have it. Keep her down. Oh, God... That's... Where's the bullet? Oh, God. I got it! I got it. She's hemorrhaging! - What? - Put pressure on the wound. We've got to take her to a hospital. Push. Push! - Please hurry! - Keep pushing. Keep pushing really hard. Shit. Sophia... It's gonna take a while without the other two keys. Every single guest went through the metal detector. Wait. Zoom in on it. I got it. It's not metal. I will strip naked every single hostage if I have to. You always manage to get all the fun for yourself. Janko, the keys are not metal. Check the hostages again. I know what they want and how to find them. Where's Mary? I have to find her first. We have to join forces. We'll go find her.Okay. Let's go. Drop the weapon. Who the fuck are you? Freeze! It's my time, Dad. Why? You sell Rossini Enterprises as a great, conscious, people-loving company. But I know what you did in the Congo, Liberia, and Iran. I know about the illegal financing and the child soldiers occupying the mines. I know about the fields in Afghanistan. It is what paid for everything you've ever had. Take them away. Thank you. You'll be rich. And I will be in power. Maybe. Excessive baggage. What's the situation? Approximately 15 to 20 commandos. Apparently, Rossini has a treasure buried underneath the villa. How did they secure the area? Explosives all around and sniper on the roof. Easy. But efficient. We shouldn't underestimate these guys. Mary? Hey! Just wanted to cut a tampon. Cooper, knife? - What are you doing with a half tampon? - Cooper. This thing was actually developed in World War I by a French surgeon for bullet wounds. Only later, they realized... Well, you get the idea. Cooper, check the wound. Still bleeding. Okay. Hold her, okay? She may wake up. - Hold her still. Hold her down. Hold her down. Hold her down! Hold her... down. How long? Without the keys? An hour. All right. Just keep a light pressure on the wound, okay? Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Bianchi? Bianchi? Bianchi? Bianchi? Two armed men walking out of the main entrance. They're not in the main hall. They're upstairs. It looks like they've been separated in different rooms. I've got visual on the sniper. He oversees the whole perimeter. I'll have to take him out before you can go in. Good luck. Did you find the keys? I've got visual on the sniper. Sniper down. Phase three. Proceed. In position. Looks pretty good. Pretty good. We have to jump. We'll call for help. Okay, okay... Okay, okay. Stop! I love you. You don't love anyone. I almost forgot. Ah, shit. Good for them. Mary? What's wrong? Her pulse! Put pressure on the wound. One, two, three, four, five. - One, two, three, four, five. - Come on! Come on, Sophia! - One, two, three, four, five. - Come on. Come on, save her! Sophia, come on! Sophia! Sophia! No! Sophia! Sophia... Police here. Good evening, gentlemen. I wouldn't do it if I were you. I'm ready for a deal, Captain. - What kind of deal? - I'm going to free all the hostages. - What do we have to do? - Nothing. I've concluded my business with Mr. Rossini, and it's time for us to leave. You provide buses for the hostages, and once they are loaded, we'll be gone. No tricks. Free five now. - For good faith. - That will not be necessary. I'll execute five hostages every time you try to break our deal. Just think about it. If everything goes right, you'll be known as the man who single-handedly managed the worst hostage crisis on Italian soil since... I'm not sure since when. Did you save her? A casualty of war. What war? Redistribution of wealth. Stealing? You don't strike me as a Robin Hood. No time to explain. You come with me. Get it out. Shit. Okay. Okay, listen. You're all gonna be free very soon. Buses are on their way, but we're gonna need to tie your hands and put hoods over your heads for this exchange to go smooth, yeah? So don't be alarmed. Cooperate and everything will run smooth. Understand? Behave. Get your hands off me! Visual on Mary. Where? The underground site. They're going down. Let's go. Come on. Good girl. Good girl! You'd better run. Psst. Wait. Shh. Anybody hurt? Okay, you're safe now. I'm gonna check the others. Stay quiet. What's going on? Okay. So, you can just leave me here. No. No way. - You don't need me. - You'd be dead by now if I didn't. But I know who you are. You're the wife, therefore I do need you. Go get Mary. Okay. Got it. Let's go. Go ahead, now. Go, go... Tell him I'm sorry. My father. Okay. Let me help you. I'm sorry. No, no! Stay with me! Frank, what happened? I'm okay. Shit.Just got a bad headache. But I'm good. Okay. Yes? Copy that. Go. Go! You navigate. I'm with you. Where are they? Most of them dead. It's over. Let's go outside. Sara? She said she forgave you. What the fuck? You son of a bitch! What's going on? Phone Tracker. App on. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! You dumb fucking bitch! I knew you were a bitch. Turn the lights off. Left, left. Fifty meters hard left, 90 degrees. Then 100 meters straight, slight right at the fork. Stop here. Hundred meters straight, slight right at the fork. This road leads right to the red spot. Come! Come on! Come on, baby! - Let go! Let go of me! - Get over here. You son of a bitch! Fuck you! Here. Come on. Not another step. Not one! Let her go. Not just yet! I don't care about the gold. Just let her go. Don't come closer! Bring me your car. I'll drive down the hill and leave her there. Deal. Come on. Here you are. Come closer. Take the bags and put them in your car. Okay. Come here. Thank you. And now... this is yours! Oh, God. He got away with it. Do you think so? A couple of stitches will do. I think it will be more than a couple. I don't like talking business at a party.And what a party. Hey. Frank, how you doing? Michael. Glad to see you're okay. So am I. Dad? Okay, okay. You're okay. I was so scared. It's okay. It's okay. Everything's good.
