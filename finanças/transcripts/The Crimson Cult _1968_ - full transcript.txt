[SCREAMING] [WHIP CRACKING] [SCREAMING] Stop! Peter Manning... Peter Manning... Peter Manning... I am Lavinia, mother of mysteries, keeper of the Black Secret. Do you know me? I know you. Do you know why you're here?I do. Are you ready to sign? I am. Sign, then. Rise, Peter Manning, enter our world of darkness. You know what you have to do. I do. [SCREAMS] The pact is done. [GRUNTS] ROBERT: Well, it's not the first time you've let us down with deliveries, you know. Only this time, it's cost me money. Yes. Yes, 1,000 pounds. Well, I'll tell you one thing, it'll be a long time before you work for me again. Well, that settled him. Money or your life? [GASPS] It's all right, spring blade. But how did you know? Well, I had a look at it this morning. You don't think I'd have done that with a real dagger, do you? What's it used for? Come here, my child, and I will tell you. This is a false bodkin. It was used in witch hunts. Now... Ooh. Now you see, if I'd done that 300 years ago, you would have been burned at the stake. Oh? Yes. They'd have probably burned you anyway. Yes, you see, if a witch hunter could stick this into a woman without drawing blood, then she'd be branded as a witch. Do you think this actual thing was used? Oh, yes. Yes, without a doubt. Well, what else did Peter send? There's a letter.Oh. Shall I read it?Yes. This is nice. What's the date? Ah, 1650... It's a lovely piece. These usually come in pairs. Is there another one? What does he say?I don't understand this. Listen, "Dear, Bob, the good stuff is getting harder than ever to find. "See what you can get for the two pieces. "I haven't been feeling all that well and intend to cut this trip short. "Will be back on Tuesday. Peter." Well, what's wrong with that? Look at the date, it was written on the ninth. Yes, that was what? 10 days ago. Not like Peter to be ill. Tell you what, ring this number, 0264122. 0264122....122. Right. Greymarshe. It's funny. What? It's what you might call my family seat, my father was born there. His family lived there for generations. Oh, hello... Who should I ask for? Oh, Morley. Is Mr. Morley there, please? Thank you. He's being called. Do you know him? Morley, do you know him? No, that must be one of Peter's contacts. Oh, hello, is that Mr. Morley? Just a moment, please, I have a call for you. Hello, Mr. Morley, my name is Robert Manning, I believe my brother's staying with you. Could I speak to him, please? Manning. Yes. His name is Peter Manning. That's odd, because we've just... You are J.D. Morley of Craxted Lodge? I see. Thank you anyway. Bye. What's that all about? He says he's never been there.What? He said he'd never even heard of him. Oh, what are we going to do now? I think I'll go down to Craxted Lodge and see this Mr. Morley. Hey, what would you like, sir? Supreme.Very well. [WHISTLING] How far is it to Greymarshe, do you know? Greymarshe, sir? Oh, yes. You would want to go straight down the road to the end of the crossroads, and then you turn left then it's first on the right. Anyway, you'll find a signpost down there. Thanks. What are you, down to celebrate, is it? For what? It's a celebration, witches' night. You get rockets, fireworks, bonfires, it's quite a spectacle. That'll be one pound, and seventy three, sir. Yes, sir, some witch or the other, they burned there. Of course, it was outlawed years ago, now, but the locals still keep up the celebrations. Oh, yeah?Thank you, sir. Oh, that's all right, thanks. Oh, thank you very much, sir, very nice of you. Do you know Craxted Lodge? What's that, sir?Craxted Lodge, it's somewhere in Greymarshe. Oh yeah, I know Craxted Lodge all right, sir. You get to Greymarshe, you'll find it all right. Thanks. Craxted Lodge. Ha! [WOMAN SCREAMS] [CAR HONKING] [LAUGHING] Hold it, hold it, what's all the panic? No excitement. I see naked girls being chased through the bushes every night of my life. He's got a point, there, but not a very big one. Say, were you going to take on the four of us? Well, I hadn't really thought about it. Well, I think you're very gallant. To the victor belongs the spoils and that's the game. Well, thank you, but I'm not really one of the players. Tell me what's this all about? It's a rather sophisticated kind of hide and seek. Oh, I see. All good, clean fun, eh? Yeah, what else?Come on, I'm cold. Listen, the gates are locked. How can I get my car round to the house? Round the back as far as you can go.Okay, thank you. And, sorry about that. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL CHANTING INDISTINCTLY] [SCREAMING] Now! One, two, three, go! Right, you both know the rules, no painting below the belts. Ready? On guard. Go. [PEOPLE CHEERING] Come on. Go on. Welcome to the party. Would you like a drink?Yes, please. Are you with anybody?I'm not really at the party. What?I've come to see Mr. Morley. I'm sorry, I can't hear. Mr. Morley! I can't hear you, you'd better come outside. Before we go any further, I'm Eve Morley, who are you? My name is Robert Manning, how do you do? Morley... It must be your husband I've come to see. No, my uncle. Is he expecting you? Not exactly, no. Well, you'll find him up the stairs, through the door and on the right. You will come back to the party? Well, I'd love to... Oh! Could you? Here.Don't be too long. I'll try not to be. Uh, excuse me? Are you Mr. Morley? Yes, I am. What can I do for you? My name is Robert Manning.Manning... Oh, yes, you're the one who spoke to me on the telephone this morning. Yes, about my brother, Peter.Yes, I remember. Well, please come in, Mr. Manning. Thank you. Sit down, won't you? I'm afraid you had a bit of a wasted journey, Mr. Manning. As I told you on the telephone this morning, I don't know your brother, and he certainly never stayed in this house. I wondered if you could help me with this? Excuse me. As you can see, it's written on your note paper and dated 10 days ago. Yes, it is. Well, I think I can explain that one. You may not be aware of it, but my niece has a rather large circle of somewhat peculiar friends. Any one of them could have taken this paper. Frankly, I think you've been made a victim of a practical joke. Not in very good taste, I admit, but then, these things do happen. See, the odd thing is that this is my brother's handwriting. Why, I'm sorry, Mr. Manning, I... I can't explain it. Well, thank you anyway, hope I haven't been too much trouble. Certainly not, no trouble at all, I'm sorry I couldn't have been of more help. Tell me, is there a hotel in the village? No, there isn't a hotel. There is a pub though, The Red Lion. I think I'll stay tonight and have a look around tomorrow. Do they have rooms there? Do you know? Well, they do, but they're a little primitive. As a matter of fact, I don't think you'd get in anyway. This is one big night of the year, here. However, I've got a better idea. Why don't you come and stay with us, here?Oh, no, I couldn't, really. Oh, certainly, why not? No problem, this house has got plenty of rooms. Anyway, I feel a slight sense of responsibility for you. After all, as you rightly said, that letter was written on my paper. Well, it's very kind of you. You sure, it wouldn't be too much trouble? Of course not. Elder, this gentleman will be staying tonight. Do you have any luggage? Oh, yes, it's out in the car, shall I... No, no, no, no, it's all right. Elder will get it for you. Car key? Oh, it's open. That's fine. We'll see you later at dinner.Yes, lovely. Mr. Manning... I think I ought to warn you that my niece is giving some sort of a party this evening, she'll probably drag you into it. I think I already have been. You know, this is a very interesting old house. I don't know, it gets a bit creepy sometimes. It's a bit like one of those old houses in horror films. Yeah, I know what you mean, as though, Boris Karloff is going to pop up at any moment. Here you are, the grey room. Do you like it? Lovely. Tell me, why do they call it the grey room? I don't know, we just always have. Should be called the Tudor room. Ever slept in one of these? Nope. I wonder if it's big enough for two. [CHUCKLES]What's your business, Mr. Manning? Name's Bob. Antiques. Well, the lodge is full of them.Yes, I've noticed. But, that's not the reason I'm here. I'm looking for my brother, Peter Manning. Does that name mean anything to you? Peter Manning? No. Well, he must be around here somewhere. And he said he'd never heard of him. Well, I hope you find him. I'll see you later. Oh, let me know if you find out. What?If it is big enough for two. [PEOPLE FROLICKING] Graveyard... So I see. What's that for? Do you mean the electricity goes out sometimes? Oh, thank you for bringing up my case. This is a very special night for us in this part of the world. The locals take it very seriously. I thought Guy Fawkes was the traditional night for burning. EVE: In other parts of England, it is. But then, only we have Lavinia.Lavinia? Yes, the Black Witch of Greymarshe. Her full name was Lavinia Morley. She was my great aunt, seven, eight, nine times removed. Does that make you a witch as well? It's not wise to joke about such matters. The devil is not exactly noted for his sense of humor... And he never sleeps. Over by my favorite corner, Basil. Then that will be all for the moment. John, why on Earth didn't you come to dinner? Oh, shall we say an unexpected obstacle arose? I'd like you to meet Professor Marsh. John, this is Robert Manning. How do you do?Manning? Manning... That name rings a bell. Do you have a family here? Well, my family used to live in Greymarshe many years ago. I knew I was right. Well, John, if you don't know what's going on around here, nobody does. Professor Marsh is the acknowledged expert on this part of the world. Past, present...And future. Elder, would you get Professor Marsh a drink? MARSH: Oh, don't bother, Elder. Just bring the glasses. As a matter of fact, I brought something rather special along with me tonight, honor of the celebration. I'll help myself. Be careful of this brandy, Elder. It's as rare as gold, but infinitely more precious. Thank you, Elder. Good girl. Completely wasted on women. Well now, what do you think of it? It's marvelous, John. Absolutely marvelous. And you, Mr. Manning? Yes, good stuff. Good stuff? Is that all you can find to say about it? What are you doing in this part of the country anyway? Well, it seems that Mr. Manning has come here to trace his brother. Yea, my brother Peter, although 'trace' is putting it a bit strongly. I'm just looking for him. I thought he might be around here somewhere, probably in the village. Probably came down to make a mockery of our ceremony too. No, I don't think so. Although, from what I've heard, it does sound a little absurd. Oh, really? Well, let me tell you, young man, in spite of it sounding a little absurd to you, Lavinia's influence has spanned the centuries. Oh, she must have been a woman of enormous power and character. Of course, she wasn't guilty of the things of which she stood accused. Maintained her innocence up to the very end. But they didn't believe her and burned her at the stake. When they mocked her as a witch, she cursed them, cursed them and their descendants. Root and branch. There's been good reason to rue the day they burned Lavinia. Many people have died, Mr. Manning. Mysteriously, horribly. There's always been a link between those who burned Lavinia and those who died. And there will be more. Well, do you still want to go to the burning? Yes, why not? Oh, good night, Professor. It's been very interesting talking to you. We shall meet again. [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] ALL: [CHANTING] Burn the witch. [DRUM BEATING] Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. Burn the witch. [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] [PEOPLE WHOOPING] [EXCLAIMS] LAVINIA: Elder, can you hear me? Yes, I hear. You did well to bring me these. There's more. How much more? The bodkin. He brought it back? He has. Then, you must fetch it, Elder. It's not easy. You can get it, Elder, if you try. I will. Good. Guilt. Will I be free of the guilt? Only part, Elder. Only part. Now, go. I was rather hoping my brother might be there. He's mad about fireworks. I think if he'd been staying at the village, he wouldn't have missed it. He might have been there. There was such a crowd. I don't think so I think if he'd been there, I would have seen him. Well, this is my door, yours is down there. Huh? Yeah. Well, see you in the morning. Good night. Yes? Get out. Go, while you can. What are you talking about? Just go before it's too late. The graveyard. Elder! A moonlight stroll, Mr. Manning? Perhaps we can help the young man in his search. First of all, we'd have to know what he's looking for, wouldn't we? [CHUCKLING] That would be most interesting. Well, Elder mentioned something about a private graveyard, so I thought I'd come down and have a look. MORLEY: Aren't you afraid of ghosts?No. I believe the dead stay dead. You may find, Mr. Manning, that when the time comes your skepticism is rather a fragile shield. I must admit, the most extraordinary things do happen on the anniversary of our burning Lavinia's effigy particularly in the village, children get upset, people walk about graveyards in the middle of the night, friends fight.Some die. It's getting very cold. I think we'd all be the better for a good, stiff drink. Don't you think, John? Splendid idea. Well, after tonight, there's not going to be much more left of this, John. All the best things in life are short lived. Do you believe that, Mr. Manning? No, I don't. I deal in antiques, you see, and I believe that antiques keep their beauty. Mr. Manning is quite young and has a great deal to learn. A decent appreciation of a fine brandy, for example. Mr. Manning, you said something outside about Elder telling you to go to the cemetery? Yes. That's not all he said, he told me to leave. Oh?Yeah, his exact words were that I should get out while there was still time. Really? Get rid of him, I've told you. Well, I shall certainly speak to him in the morning, I must apologize for his rudeness. Oh, it's quite all right, I didn't really take him very seriously. I'm afraid he's a little... To put it mildly. I have a certain sense of responsibility for him, you know. His father was one of our tenant farmers. The Elders have lived on Morley property for centuries. About 10 years ago, his father died in somewhat tragic circumstances. Elder had a sort of nervous breakdown. After that, he couldn't go on working on the farm, so my father gave him a job in the house. But I won't have him annoying my guests. I shall have to give him something to do in the garden. Why don't you pension him off and be done with it? Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't brought it up now. Well, thank you for putting me up, Mr. Morley. But I've had rather a long drive down and it has been a rather hectic evening. You won't think me rude if I say good night, turn in now? My dear fellow, of course not, you know the way to your room. Good night. Good night, Professor.Good night there. Are you going to be in the neighborhood for a few days? Oh, yes I am.I have a rather amusing little collection you might be interested in seeing. Oh, really, what do you collect? Instruments of torture. [GASPING] PETER: Robert, Robert, Robert... Peter... [LOUD RUMBLING] Sign. Sign! Sign! Sign! No! Good morning.Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late. I didn't sleep very well last night. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I had a most incredible nightmare last night. Really? Yes, I dreamt I was at some sort of witch's Sabbath. And the odd thing is that the witch in my dream was exactly like the one that we burned on the bonfire last night. It was so vivid. Almost as though it wasn't a dream at all, as though it was really happening. Sounds to me as if you'd been slightly affected by our local festivities. Yes, possibly. What are your plans for today? Well, I thought I'd walk down to the village, make a few enquiries about my brother and if I can't find out anything, go back to town, I suppose, this evening. Well, you're welcome to stay here as long as you like. Oh, that's very kind of you, I might take you up on that. Well, I've got a lot of things to do. I have to get on. Will you excuse me? Yes, of course. It was very kind of your uncle to ask me to stay on here. We're a very kind family. Yes, I've noticed. Tell me more about your dream. I'm very interested. Well, it was a bit confused, really. I think it was some sort of ceremony. All sorts of odd people there. There was a goat, I remember. And, the witch I told you about was sitting on a kind of throne. Oh, yes, and my brother was there too. Most peculiar. What are you going to do when you get down to the village? Well, I thought I'd make a few enquiries about my brother. I'll go to the police station, find out if there's been any accidents or anything like that. Then go to the pub, various places. Oh, are there any antique shops in the village? Yes, there are two, there's one in the High Street and one by the memorial. Thanks. I must go.Oh. Aren't you going to walk down to the village with me? No, I have to go to work. Work?I'm typing for Professor Marsh. He's writing a book.What's the book about? Oh, didn't you know? He's one of the worlds leading authorities on witchcraft. I must go. No, don't get up. Finish your breakfast. I'll see you later.Bye. [GUNSHOT] Keep still or I'll break your neck. Now, why were you shooting at me? I said, why were you shooting at me? What do you expect the man to answer when you're practically strangling him? What the hell are you doing here? Oh, don't be a fool. Let go of him. Do you want to kill him? He wasn't shooting at you. Can't he speak for himself? Even under normal circumstances, I'm afraid not. He's a mute. If he wasn't shooting at me, who was he shooting at? Not who, what. Quite harmless even for the birds, I'm afraid, this morning. I don't know about harmless, he nearly blew my head off. He can't speak for himself, so I apologize for him. Well, I suggest that you don't give him any more loaded guns to play with, or he really will kill somebody. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? ROBERT: It's me, Bob. Hello. Has Peter showed up yet? No. Isn't he with you? No, he's not. Any mail from him? No, nothing. How are you doing? Fine. That woman came in for the clock. Oh, how much did you get for it? Fifty pounds! Not so bad. Are you all right? You sound strange. Yes, I'm all right. I've had a bad night, that's all. All right, I'll see you soon. Bye. Yeah, bye. Did you find him? Oh, hello. No. Nobody's seen him, nobody's heard of him. What are you going to do? I don't know. Go back to town, I suppose. What does he look like? Who, Peter? Well, he's about as tall as me, he's got fair hair and blue eyes. Oh, that's funny. We had a man staying here a couple of weeks ago. He was tall and fair, but his name wasn't Peter Manning. It was Bosper... Dennis Bosper?Yes. Of course. That's the name he uses when he doesn't want people to know he's a dealer. We get things cheaper that way. Of course. Why didn't I think of that before? How long ago did you say he was here? About 10 days. How long did he stay? Two or three. I didn't really see much of him. Oh, don't worry, he's probably gone home by now. No, he's not. I rang my secretary while I was in the village. She hasn't heard from him. Well there's nothing I can do about it tonight. I'll sort it all out in the morning. Perhaps he's gone off with some bird. I'm going to bed. Good night. [MOANS] Yes, I know. My room's over there. Good night. [SOFT TAPPING] I must fetch the bodkin... You're going to tell me what's going on in this house. Now, what's the matter with you? What are you afraid of? And what were you doing in here? Was it this you were after? It's all right, I'm not going to hurt you. [STUTTERING] Bodkin... Give... Not until after you've told me what I want to know. I must fetch the bodkin. My brother stayed here, didn't he? My brother Peter. Dennis Bosper. He stayed here, didn't he? I thought so. In this room? Where is he now? What happened to him? Tell me what happened to him! Dead... Oh, Mr. Morley...Yes? Could I have a word with you? Yes, by all means. Go to the library. I'll be with you in a minute. I see you're having a look at my collection. Yes. That's quite an interesting piece you've got there. We call it a bodkin. One of a pair actually. The other was a fake, spring-loaded. As a matter of fact, it disappeared recently. Disappeared? Yes, I think someone must have stolen it. I really don't know. It'll probably turn up soon. Brandy? Yes, please. Thank you. Now, what was it you wanted to see me about? My brother was in this house. We have been through all this before... Yes, you probably knew him as Dennis Bosper. Dennis Bosper? Ah, yes. I do remember somebody of that name. He was here about a week ago. As a matter of fact I sold him some silver. I don't quite understand though why, if he was your brother, he took all that trouble to change his name. Well, that's not important. The point is, he was here, and I want to know what's happened to him. Well, I've already told you I haven't the slightest idea. Elder told me he was dead. I think you must have seen enough of Elder to know that he isn't entirely normal. You really shouldn't pay too much attention to what he says. Now, that may be, but I'm sorry, Mr. Morley, I'm not happy about this. I think I should be putting it into the hands of the police. By all means, do. I just hope they can be more help to you than I've been. Look, Mr. Manning, if you take my advice, you'll finish your drink, go to bed, and get a good night's sleep. I'm quite sure this'll all work itself out in the morning. Good night. Good night. [ECHOING] Robert. Robert, I'm here. [RUMBLING] [ECHOING] Bring in Robert Manning! You are Robert Manning. Are you prepared to sign? [INAUDIBLE] You will sign! Sign! POLICEMAN: Stop! What are you up to? You all right, sir? You can't go walking around in pajamas on a night like this! You'll catch your death. I must have been sleepwalking. Here, you're bleeding. That looks bad, sir. Where are you staying, up at the house? Come on then, I'll help you over there and we'll get that arm fixed. Come on, sir. EVE: Who is it? It's me, Bob. Wait a minute. What have you done? You'd better come in. Let me have a look. Careful. Oh. Come over here and I'll clean it up. Better take off your jacket. How did you do this? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? Well, where have you been? Down by the lake. By the lake? At this time of night? I must have been sleepwalking. I found myself down there. Oh, you're shivering. You'd better get into bed and keep warm. I'll find something to put around that. I'm sorry to be so much trouble. Oh, that's all right. This is a very deep cut. I don't understand how you could have got this without knowing. Do you know it looks as though you've been stabbed? I think I was. What do you mean, you think? You must know! Well, I had this dream again last night. I dreamt I was back in the same room, and the witch had a knife and she stabbed me. Yes, but that was only a dream. Well, I'm not so sure. You see, when I woke up, I was down by the lake and my arm was bleeding. Have you sleepwalked before? No, never. Okay?I'm afraid that'll have to do. [MOANS]Feel all right now? Yes, fine, thanks. Oh, this is a comfortable bed. I don't feel like moving. Well, it's only big enough for one. Well then, where are you going to sleep? Come on, Bob, you'd better go back to your own room now. I'm too ill to be moved. Come on, Bob. You must go back to... Sorry. Look here, I've got a much better idea. Hello, you're up bright and early. We haven't opened up shop yet. Oh, it's you, sir! Didn't expect to see you about today. How are you feeling? All right. Thanks. Oh, and thank you for helping me last night. Yeah, that's all right, sir. What can I do for you? I don't really know where to start. Try the beginning, sir. All right. As you know, I came down to Greymarshe to find my brother. Oh, yes. Mr. Manning. Well, I found out that he definitely stayed two nights at the lodge, and than he disappeared. And that was over... Over a week ago. Well, do you want me to list him as a missing person? No, I think he's still around here somewhere. Well, what makes you think that then? I don't know. It's just a feeling I've got. Well, how can I help you? Well, I think there's something strange going on up at the lodge, and I'd like you to come up there with me. Why? Well, in the first place, I found a secret panel in my room leading up to a room in the loft. Now, this room... Oh, shouldn't worry too much about that, sir. Lots of old houses around here have secret passages, you know. Anyhow, I can't go up there without a search warrant. What would Mr. Morley say? Well, what about Elder, the butler? He told me my brother was dead. [LAUGHING] I shouldn't take too much notice of what Elder says, sir. We don't in the village. You know... How do you account for all that business last night down by the lake? I've never walked in my sleep before in my life. And how did I get that cut on my arm? That business of the candle... Are you all right, sir?What? You didn't get very much sleep last night, did you? Why don't you go on back to the lodge and get your feet up for a couple of hours? I think you'd feel a lot better, you know. Sergeant, I'm all right. I know there's something wrong going on up at that lodge. And if you're not going to help me, I'm going to do it myself! Do you know where Professor Marsh lives? It's the last house in the village, sir. The white one on the right. Why, Manning, what a delightful surprise. After yesterday's misunderstanding, I hardly expected to see you again. Yes, I'm sorry about that, but it's just that I don't like being shot at. Tell me, is Eve around anywhere? I'm afraid not. She went to do an errand for me, and won't be back for some tine. Oh, it's probably just as well. Actually, I came to see you. Oh, of course. I was going to show you my collection. Now, here, an extraordinary 13th century... I really didn't come to see these. I came to talk to you. Oh. Sit down, won't you? Thank you. I understand, you are an authority on witchcraft. Well, yes, I suppose I am. Well, tell me, in witchcraft, is there any significance in writing one's name in a book? In blood? Yes. Oh, great significance. Once you've done that, you're trapped. There's no turning back. Why do you ask? Well, it's just that these past two nights, I've had the most extraordinary dreams. Nightmares really. Tell me about them. Well, they're not very clear, really. It seems as if there's some sort of ceremony. And there are all sorts of odd people around. There's a goat... Ah, yes. The goat god. The Great God Pan. Eroticism. Then there was a man with antlers. Herne the Hunter. All traditional figures going back to the Middle Ages and beyond. What I don't understand is how a person like me, that knows nothing at all about witchcraft can have dreams in such detail. But we all know the subconscious mind can play strange, sometimes terrifying tricks. The living bridge between this world and the unknown. Particularly in your case. Did you realize that you're the linear descendant of Jonathan Manning, who was the principal accuser of Lavinia at her trial for witchcraft? No, I didn't.Well, it remains a fact, and it could have great significance, coupled with the fact that you're the sole surviving member of the Manning family. Apart from my brother. Yes, your brother. May I offer you a drink? No, thanks. I really must be going. Oh, and thank you for the information. You'll forgive me if I leave you to find your own way out? Yes, of course. Oh, when Eve comes back, could you tell her I'd like to see her? Yes. Thank you. Bye. Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, I got your message. Listen, come upstairs, there's something I want to show you. When I got back to my room this morning, I found some blood stains on the floor. Blood?Yes, blood. I thought it was mine. Watch. You really didn't know about this, did you? No, I promise. Come on, I'll show you. I saw all this in my dream. Oh, but that's impossible. I tell you, I did. It didn't look like this, but this is the same room, I'm sure of it. And this was here. There was a fire in that forge. There was a man with antlers on his head. And there was a goat. Oh, don't be so ridiculous. Nobody's been up here for years. Well, just look at the dust. Yeah, and all these cobwebs... Eve... These cobwebs are fake. What? They're made of a rubber solution. I knew it! I didn't dream this place, I was brought here. But why? Let me think. They wanted me to sign a book. I was sitting in this chair. They brought the book over, and I wouldn't sign it because I knew that if I did, they'd kill me. Is this the book? Yes, that's it! Look.Peter Manning! My brother was here. That's his signature. There must be some meaning to all this. I say, you should ask my uncle. I think he knows already. What do you mean? I'm not sure yet. Look, what about these names? Do they mean anything to you? No. Are there any village records anywhere? Oh, there must be. Well, who would know about that? The vicar, I suppose. Look, I've got to have another look round. You go down to the village, and see if you could find out who these people were. Be careful. Oh, and remember, don't say anything to your uncle. Yes, I think we might be able to help you, Miss Morley. It's very important. I'm sure it must be, for you to call at this hour of the night. All their names, I think you said... Yes, the names of all those at her trial. Yes. Well, 1652 will be the year you want. [SIGHS] 1652... Here we are. "January the 25th. On this day was put to death "Lavinia Morley, accused and proved to be a witch." And that's all it says? It's the only entry in the parish register. Of course, we do have an account of trials here. There might be something in that. Is there anything else? Afraid not. Oh, unless... My predecessor collected all sorts of bits and pieces. He was going to write a history of the parish. He never did though. I'm afraid that's not it. That's not it. Bless my soul, this may be what you're looking for. [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] "An exact and perfect relation of the life and devilish practices "of Lavinia Morley."Uh-huh. Look, the names of the accusers. Elder's name. Where did you get that list? It's rather extraordinary. We found a secret passage at the house. Sergeant, you'd better come up to the lodge right away. Oh, not that again. Look, I've found Elder's body in the loft. Body?Yes, and I've found this, too. It's my brother's identity bracelet. All right, sir, this is a CID matter. I'll get on to them right away and I'll follow you up there. Eve! Eve, dear, have you got a moment to spare? Yes, of course.I'd like to have a chat with you. [EVE SCREAMING] And I shall see the curse fulfilled. But you, descendant of Lavinia, blood of her blood, you have betrayed us. Your life shall be forfeit. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? This is the vicar here. Oh, good evening, Vicar. I just hope the information that I sent you will be of help to you in writing your book. What information? Well, Miss Morley's just been here. Eve, yes. You didn't send her? Certainly not. Well, she told me the most amazing stories about Craxted Lodge. You mean you didn't know about the witch room? You say the entrance is in the grey room? Thank you very much. Goodbye. Basil, get the car. [CAR APPROACHING] ROBERT: Eve! Eve! A Manning and a Morley. A fitting tribute. Now it is complete. Lavinia, this child has betrayed the trust I placed in her. She's no longer worthy to bear your name. Therefore, I offer you her blood. [SIREN WAILING] He was mad. For years, I suspected he had a split mind. He thought he was a warlock. Sworn to destroy the descendants of poor Lavinia's accusers. But how was he doing all this? I mean, how did he get me up to that room and induce those dreams? Hypnotism. I knew about the existence of the witch's room. I realized that once Morley knew that you and Robert had been there, he was bound to destroy you. You were the last of the Manning line. The lest chance I had to force Morley to give himself away. Here, look! High on the roof, here. [SHOUTING] [FIRE ROARING] [CACKLING]
