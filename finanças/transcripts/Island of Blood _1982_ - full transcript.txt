You got it. - The old widows giving the island and the school to a city church group for a retreat. In return, she's gonna get some damn big tax break. - Knowing the old widow, I'd probably say you're right. She done it yet? - Not till the end of the summer when they come out to look it over. That's a shame. It's a valuable piece of real estate. - That's all you ever think about. Just building more and more of them damn junk homes. Now, Bert. That's how I make my living. Just like you sell information. - The only real value on that island is the school. It's a landmark. A landmark of memories, good memories.

Boats here. ♪ Black hole ♪ - Director guy doesn't like boats, does he? Hi. Hi. Oh. I'm just looking for a place to change. I'm BJ. I'm Donna Lincoln. Is this your first film, too? Well, as an actress. I've done a few commercials. - Well, it's just everybody's first film. That's weird. What's so weird about that? It's a chance. I'm going to change. - Well, why don't you change upstairs? Why? That's where I changed. Okay. What's the matter? Scared ya, huh? Are you crazy? It's only cardboard. It's just a joke. It's just a joke. Just a joke. My names Steve Faith and this is our director, Franklin Phlem. Right. Phlem? - I'd like to make a few points before we start here. Please, no drugs or alcohol. Franklin Phlem. What a name. Sounds like a case of pneumonia to me. - We have a caretaker named Bert. Now, seeing as there are no phones on this island, the only phone we have is a radio phone on Bert's boat. We need his cooperation. So please, don't annoy Bert. Okay? Now, I'd like to tell you a little bit about the film that we're gonna make. You know, when you look at books and magazines, movies, watch television these days, it always paints the picture of the world as being some kind of sewer and that we're all gonna go up in some big holocaust. Amen, pal. - Well, we're gonna do something different. We're gonna make a film that's very positive. Has something to say to the youth. That makes a statement. Shows 'em what is right with the world. What is? - Would you mind holding it down? Down as far as it gets. - Now, not everybody is an exploiter or a sex maniac, or a thief or a murderer. People do help people and that is the point that we're gonna make with this film. This is an up up film. Right? That's right. - And we have a real hero played by Betty John. Betty Jean. Right. Basically, our storyline is about Betty Jean and her friends who put on a rock musical to help raise money for the school's musical scholarship program. These are up up people. Right? That's right. So, we're gonna start Monday as soon as the crew gets here and that will give us a couple of clays of rehearsal. - I'd like to start working with Betty Jean. - Do you need the two of us? Later. When do we eat? Later. - Okay, I'm sure we're all gonna do a wonderful job here and that's it. Look, guys and gals. The only way to save our school scholarship fund is to put on a rock musical. We can all be performers and we can use my uncle's barn. Are you with me, guys and gals? Hello. They call this a rehearsal hall? Okay, we don't have much time. So I want you to turn to the beach scene on page 76. - Can I say something about the script? What about my script? It, it it was good. 76. Now, up until this point the audience has seen your character as very shallow and inane but in this next scene, the beach scene with Rick, we see for the first time how much real depth and feeling she has. Make love to me, Rick. I need you now. Right now. I can't do this play without you. I need you, Rick. That's it? Too much emotion? Too much? Should I give it less? Less? It's the scene, it's overwritten. Just cut it to one line. I need help. I need help? Right. Can I go to the bathroom? Please. Go from one disaster to another. So, how's she doing? Huh? BJ. Oh. Great casting. She has a definite quality. It's different. Excuse me. Can I get something to eat? - You'll eat when the foods ready. Can I ask what we're having? - You'll find out when it's served. Thanks. Look, fella. I don't like nothing about your generation. If I owned this island, you wouldn't be here, none of ya. - What have we done that you don't like? So far just showing up. You tell the others, they eat what I put on the table or they don't get nothing. I'm not gonna mess with a bunch of food picky drug freaks. Know any jokes? Don't mock me. I may look old but I'm still strong enough to break some bones. I believe you. Nice guy. I hope he can cook. - Makes it pretty clear he doesn't like our generation. - There aint gonna be anymore generations. What are you a prophet? - Where do you live, a tree in Disneyland? They've got enough bombs on this Earth to blow us out of orbit. That's a fact. They're gonna do it and there's nothing we're gonna be able to say about it. I think I've lost my appetite. - They're gonna blow up the world and you're worried about your damn stomach. Get smart, pal. - He's as much fun as the guy in the kitchen. - He's right when he said the world sucks. Where you going? To shoot myself. I want to be first at the pearly gates. I hate long lines.
