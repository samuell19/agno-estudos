(EXHALES) (CELL PHONE CHIMES) (CAR LOCK BEEPS) (CELL PHONE CHIMES) (STATIC SOUNDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, Brian. Hey, how ya doin'? What's up, Clint? How ya doin'? Yo, how about that Bills game, huh? I told you, didn't I? Number one! I told you! Yo, Thomas, got another load for you, man. Whoa! Hey! Come on! Come on, Brian! I told you a million times not to sneak up on me like that! I called out. What? Sorry. Well, you'll be really sorry if a spark catches that beautiful head of hair on fire. (CHUCKLES) Hey, man, me and some of the boys are gonna stop by Bulldog's for a beer after work. You want to come? Oh, by the time you're finishing your shift, I'm crawling into bed. Come on, man, it's Friday night. I appreciate the offer, Brian. I really do. But the girls have an early meet tomorrow. I gotta be rested. Yeah, yeah. I got it. Mr. Responsibility. You need to live a little, man. What am I gonna do at a bar? I don't drink anymore. Which is why you're gonna drive me to poker night tomorrow. Uh, unless you're too old and tired for that now, too. Oh, I wouldn't miss that. I wouldn't miss it. Good, 'cause I'm gonna have some beers. Don't wanna have to worry about driving. Brian! You wanna quit playing grab-ass with your boyfriend there and get back to work? You got it. (BELL RINGS) (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) THOMAS: You saw the difference, though, right? See how much more pull you got when you keep your arms close to your head on the downstroke? Yeah, Dad. So, good. And, Amy, you keep shaving time off like that... Whoo! We're gonna be at the finals before you know it. Thanks. I call shotgun! Why do you always get to ride in the window seat? Because I'm older than you, Amy. Dad? Oh, it's a five-minute ride, Amy. Just... Stacey, next time, your sister gets to ride shotgun. STACEY: Fine. Stace! Keys! (GRUNTS) STACEY: Give me that remote. AMY: No! You always get it! STACEY: Why does it matter? We always watch the same thing. AMY: 'Cause we only have one TV. Oh, come on, now. You two fight all the time. Sorry. I told you to let Shadow in. STACEY: You were supposed to do that. AMY: No, you were. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Attaboy. Yes, yes. You missed me, didn't you? You missed me, didn't you? Yeah. I can't eat this, Dad. Do you know how much fat and salt is in this stuff? You don't need to worry about your weight, honey. You're perfectly healthy. Not if I keep eating this. Well, I am terribly sorry, Your Highness. But I don't have time to make you a gourmet meal every night. I have a job, you know. CAROL: I'm home! Hey, Mom. Hey! Hey. Sorry I'm late. Hey. Work. What's for dinner? (KISSES) I'm starving. (KISSES) Do you know how much fat and salt is in this stuff? (AMY AND STACEY CHUCKLING) STACEY: I told you. Stacey, only one hour of TV tonight, okay? You have an early meet tomorrow. I want you rested. STACEY: Okay. I'm taking Shadow for his walk. Can I come? Yes, you can, peanut. Come on. You know that new TV show I've been watching? Well, you wouldn't believe how much money they spent on this girl's party. They gave her two cars. Can you believe that? Two cars. And it's supposed to be reality TV, but it's all for show. I mean, it's like it's better than real. Right? Better than real? I don't even know what that means. THOMAS: I love you both. Good night, girls. Finally asleep? Finally some peace. MAN ON TV: This sister act performed alongside The Champagne Music Makers, The Lennon Sisters. WOMAN ON TV: I'm gonna say $750. MAN: $750. I'm sorry. You have underbid... WOMAN: Oh! (ALARM CLOCK BEEPING) Mmm. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on. GIRLS: Oh! Come on, sleepyheads. Hurry it up, you two. We gotta leave in 10 minutes. Eat, eat. Boom, snap, clap. Ba-boom, snap, clap. Snap, boom, snap, clap. Ba-boom, snap... (CROWD CHEERING) Whoo! (CHEERING) Thanks, Mom. Amy, I'm so happy for you. Thank you. You did really great. Thanks. Amy got first-place medal, which was really great, but Stacey did good, too. Yeah. I mean, yeah... Oh, um... I don't see why not. I'll just talk to Thomas, and I'll call you back, okay? What's that? Um, Tina says that everyone's meeting up for dinner at Applebud's. Oh, no, tonight's my poker night. Remember? Oh, that's right. Oh, come on. You can skip it one night, can't you? One night a month, Carol. One night I get to spend with the guys. Okay. Just a suggestion. This is delicious, Carol. Oh, I just threw it together. Could've fooled me. Your mother does feed you every once in a while, right, Brian? What can I say? I'm a growin' boy. (ALL CHUCKLING) Nice work, hot shot. First place, huh? Yeah. I set a new school record. Good one! Thanks. Watch out, Olympics. Here comes Amy "The Barracuda" Montgomery! You ready? Yeah. Not as ready as you are. Let's go. We're gonna be late. Well, take it easy, man. It's a poker game, not a movie. We'll get there when we get there. Ladies, don't wait up for me. Have fun tonight, okay? STACEY: Thanks, Dad. Let's go. You're always late. This is my one night out a month. Man, you could stand to take it easy on the cologne. Or at least have the decency to switch up your smell every once in a while. I'm just trying to counteract your locker room and distillery stench. Hey, give me a break, man. I just woke up a few hours ago. Youth is wasted on the young. Yeah, well, you'd understand if you knew what kind of night I had last night. Oh, yeah? How so? You don't wanna know. No, I do not. I do not wanna know. Her name's Mandy. She's in one of my classes... And, uh, I've had my eye on her for a few weeks now, so I invited her and her friends out last night. Okay, enough stalling. I call. Let's see 'em. Ah. Read 'em and weep, boys! Ah. What? You gotta know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em. (ALL CHUCKLING) Now don't be sore losers. That's not why we're groaning. RAY: Yeah. BRIAN: Yeah. (ALL LAUGHING) So many chips. Yeah. Ante up. Consider yourself lucky. When I was your age, I was liberating Kuwait City. And that's worse than filling hoppers full of metal all day? It's a lot better than hot metal flying over your head all day, I'll tell you that. (CHUCKLES) Tell him, Thomas. I'm afraid I can't support you on that, Jake. My... My time in the Marines was some of the best times of my life. It was tough, sure, but it's supposed to be tough. I'd probably still be in, if I hadn't gotten hurt in a training exercise. I... I was stupid. Truly, I... I miss my time in the service. Take my word for it. Combat ain't all it's cracked up to be. Whatever. I get my degree next year, and as soon as I do, I am outta here. If I ever see another steel rod, it'll be too soon. What are you trying to say, Brian? That you're too good for a career in the manufacture of portable abrasive power tools for grinding, deburring, sanding, and polishing? Huh? Yeah, Ray. That's exactly what I'm saying. (ALL LAUGHING) This guy. Well, don't forget about us little guys when you're gone, Mr. Big Shot. Well, it has been a pleasure taking all your money, but it's late. I gotta go. Are you kidding? It's just midnight. It's Saturday. I know. But unlike you, some of us have responsibilities. Ooh. I wish we could play more than once a month. Yeah, well, we do. We play at All Betz Off. We got a game or two going almost every night. Where's that? Uh. It's at your house, dude. (CHUCKLES) It's only one of the biggest online gaming sites in the world. You do know how to use a computer, don't you, old man? Of course I do, but I... I don't really... We have one. I don't really look at the Internet much. But it's not just the game. I like talking to you guys. Most of the time we're doing more chatting than playing, anyway. THOMAS: What do you mean? You're on the phone while you're on the computer? No. We play poker online, and then we send messages to each other to talk. Really? Look, just type that into your browser and then, uh, follow the sign-in instructions. Those names below are our user names. Just come tomorrow night. We'll show you how it's done. Okay. I'll give that a try. Right on. Now for the cashing-out process. RAY: Oh, man. Might want to make yourselves comfortable. Oh. Mmm. You have fun tonight? Yeah. You? Mmm. Missed you. Mmm-hmm. You want to try? Sorry, Carol. I think I'm just tired, is all. It's okay. I love you, Carol. Hmm. I know. I love you, too. Hmm. (WHIRRING) Good boy. Good boy, Shadow. Good boy. (INDISTINCT) No. Hey. What you doin'? Oh, the guys told me they meet on this website, play poker sometimes. They invited me to join. Nice. Welcome to the 21st century. I don't know. Seems a little impersonal to me. It's not like sitting together and playing. I think you'll be surprised. (KISSES) Oh. I have the early shift tomorrow, so can you get them up and ready for school? Uh, sure, no problem. Okay. Don't stay up too late. (KISSES) Mmm-hmm. Wow. How am I gonna... (COMPUTER CHIMES) Huh? How does he know it's me? Noob. Ah. Ah-ha. Oh, my God. This is crazy. Oh. Yes! Ah. I'm gonna take all your money, man. Ha! Oh, boy. (CHUCKLES) You're dead. I like this. I never get straights. I don't have to smell your cheap cigar! Ha-ha. Very funny. "Talhotblond." What? Well, I like your name. What's not to like? (EXHALES) (EXHALES) Are you kiddin' me? Wow. Hmm. ...making it through regular high school. Oh, my God. Hi, Katie. Call me Tommy. Oh, no. I don't have a picture. Uh... (EXHALES DEEPLY) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come on, ladies! Rise and shine! Let's go! Come on! Come on! It's only 6:30. We've got plenty of time. I know, I know. Come on, girls! Get the lead out! STACEY: All right. The bus is almost here. The bus? Seriously? I'm sorry, honey, but I've got some things to do before work, and I just won't have time to take you. Bye! Bye, Dad! I'll pick you up after school! I love you! Love you, too! What happened to you last night? What? Last night, online. You were on a roll, then you just up and disappeared. Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Uh, I didn't realize how late it was. Okay. Well, you gonna be back on tonight, give us a chance to win back our chits? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Girls in bed? Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. (TV PLAYING) How was your day? Oh, long. You know, not only did I have to go in early, but then, Elizabeth called in sick because Theresa got the flu or something and she had to stay and take care of her. And Dr. Thompson, you know, sometimes I think he's losing his mind or something, because he keeps asking the same questions over and over again. And, I mean, he's almost 80. And he goes into work every day, which is commendable, but sometimes I think he's getting Alzheimer's. Mmm. You must be tired. Mmm, when am I not? Maybe you should get ready for bed. Get a good night's sleep. Yeah, maybe I should. Maybe that's just what I need. Good night. You win some, you lose some, boys. Come on, Katie. What you doin'? Oh, I just, uh, figured I'd play a few hands with the boys. Two nights in a row. Three if you count real poker night. It's relaxing for me. You don't have anything against me relaxing after a hard day's work, do you? Well, of course not. You could use some relaxing, obviously. Okay. All right, don't stay up too late, okay? Come on, Katie. (COMPUTER CHIMES) Hi, Katie. So impatient. Here it comes. Harrison Ford. (CHUCKLES) "Old guy." Not so bad yourself. I know. Worse when I'm deployed. Afghanistan. How far is that? Not brave... A true marine fights to defend what he loves. Of course. I like chatting with you, too. I gotta go. Wow. You are so beautiful. What on earth are you doing on there? Oh, you know, e-mails, surfing. The usual. Why? You have been online for two hours. Oh. Look who's talking. You've been hogging it practically every night for the last month. I'm just gonna be a little bit. What? I told the guys I'd be there at 9:00. That was an hour ago. Can't you do that some other time? Oh, yeah. Like I've got all the time in the world. You can miss one night of computer online poker every once in a while. It won't kill you. I'm home! STACEY: Can I see it? AMY: It's not yours, Stacey. THOMAS: It's not a toy, and it's not yours, either. THOMAS: Hey. Hey, what's going on? Dad got a new computer. This one's way more awesome than the old one. It's awesome. Wow. That's unexpected. Girls, don't you have some homework you should do? Now? Dad. Now, please. Come on. Thank you. What did you do? Oh, now, don't start... We have a computer already. I know that, but it's old and it's slow, and I figured, why fight over the one we have? How did you pay for that? I put it on the credit card. Ah. Well, it's only a few extra dollars a month on the bill. We don't have a few extra dollars a month. Well, I work hard all day for us, Carol, to take care of you and the girls. I work hard, too, Thomas. I work just as hard as you do. I know that. That's not what I'm saying. What are you saying, then? What made you think that you could go out and buy that thing without talking it over with me first? We couldn't survive without you working. I know that. And I... I appreciate it. I do. And together, we make sure the girls have everything they need, and you, too. If... If one of you needs a new pair of shoes or some makeup, we take care of that, right? That's ridiculous. A new pair of shoes doesn't cost as much as a computer. I've been wearing these same boots for the last eight years, Carol. How many pairs of shoes have you bought in the last eight years? All the money I bring in to help us, I don't ask for much, do I? I just wanted something. Just once. Just for me. Would you begrudge me that? No. Okay. Thank you, Carol. I love you. Dinner's on the stove. THOMAS: I love my time with you. Someday, Katie. When I get back from my tour. I promise. THOMAS: Don't be sad, Katie. I'm not. The time I spend here with you, it's what keeps me alive. Sometimes I feel like you're the only thing I've got going for me. The men in my platoon are okay, but they don't take the time to understand me like you do. And my C.O... Well, I've got to stick with him because that's the way things are. But sometimes I wish I didn't have to. I gotta go. We'll talk tomorrow. Oh. I love you, Tommy. I love you, too. Oh! You still up? Oh! Don't go creeping up on me like that, Carol. You almost gave me a heart attack. I thought you'd gone to bed. Yeah, I was, but... Come on. It's so late. Oh, just, uh... Let me just finish this one hand. Mmm. Okay. Hey, I was thinking, um... It's been awhile and we're both so busy. Why don't we go out tomorrow night, just the two of us? Are you, like, asking me out on a date or something? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. I mean, what about the girls? Who will watch them? Well, we'll just go to dinner and a movie. We'll be home before midnight. They can watch themselves for a couple hours. Okay. Yeah, okay. It's a... It's a date. Now let's go to bed. Come on. Okay. This place is so nice. I'm surprised we've never been here before. I'm not. Look at these prices. Says the man who just bought himself a new laptop computer. Oh, come on. I'm just ribbing you, honey. Live a little, why don't you? It's worth it just to have the time together, don't you think? MAN ON SCREEN: Are you kidding me? I don't have a car. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Are you kidding me? I don't have one! That was really nice tonight, Thomas. Thank you. Hmm? Oh, sure. Of course. I thought the movie was pretty funny, didn't you? Oh, damn it. Come on. What are you doing? Ha. They're not my friends. (SPEAKING) No. What is it? Tommy, what's wrong? Oh, nothing's wrong. I'm sorry, it's just... Look, I play with those guys, but they don't know the truth about me. What I'm really doing here is, it's not something that I'm even supposed to be talking about. But I have to keep my real self separate from my gamer self. You understand? Yeah, of course. Are you mad at me? No, no, of course not. I just... You just don't need to be playing with those guys anymore. Okay? I was so worried. You left so suddenly the other day after I said... After I told you that I loved you. I don't wanna freak you out. If we're moving too fast, we can, you know... I mailed you something. It should be at your dad's house by Monday. Really? Mmm. What is it? Just a little something for my brave soldier. I can't wait to find out. You are excited, aren't you? I want you so bad. I want you too, baby. (KATIE SPEAKING) Oh. (PANTS) (CHUCKLES) Mmm. Good morning, sleepyhead. What are you doing? What's... How long have you been up? Got up early and went for a run. A run? Yeah. I'm gonna be 50 soon. I figured it was time to get back into fighting shape. You know what I mean? Okay. Never too late to turn over a new leaf. Sure. Never too late. I'm gonna go get the girls up. Then I'm gonna hop in the shower and cool off, okay? Okay. (CHUCKLES) BOTH: Morning, Mom. Hi! What up, Thomas? Same old, same old. Literally. I feel ya. Hey, uh, so, what's up with that tall hot blonde, huh? What do you mean? I mean, look, where'd you meet up with her? She just... I meet all kinds of people online. We just chat, you know? I wouldn't mind chatting with her some more myself. I mean, she seems... She seems pretty cool. Yeah. She's... She's cool. It's too bad she lives so far. Uh, what's... What's the deal with you two, anyway? (SNICKERS) Nothing. We just chat. This and that. Like I said... I figured as much. I mean, you're old enough to be her father, right? She's really something, though. I mean, we only chatted for a few minutes, but it's crazy how much we have in common. She's a cheerleader. I was captain of the football team. She wants to major in Media when she goes to college next fall. That's the same major as me. I mean, how perfect is that? Yeah. How perfect is that? So, is she... Is she, like, really tall, hot, and blond? How would I know? I... I don't know. I figured maybe she sent you a picture or something, how well you guys know each other. Nope. Sorry! Huh. Now I gotta know. Maybe I'll ask her for one next time we play. Don't worry. I'll let you take a look, too. All right, get back to work. (GRUNTS) THOMAS: Hey! You're home early. Well, it's Dr. Thompson's wedding anniversary, so he closed up early today. Hey, girls! STACEY: Hey, Mom! AMY: Hey! Why do you look so surprised? I told you all about it Friday night at dinner. Oh, that's right. How romantic. I promise, I'll take off early when we're old and have an anniversary. (CHUCKLES) News flash, honey, we're already old. We are not old. Gimme that. I'll go feed Shadow. You sure are hungry. Yeah. I guess the exercise is affecting my metabolism. Hmm. Speaking of, I better go walk Shadow. Can I come? No time to wait, kiddo. You gotta finish your food. Maybe tomorrow, okay? Shadow. KATIE: My dearest Tommy, I hope this finds you well and that the things inside help you through your dark days. I can't wait until you return to me. I love you. Katie. Oh. (KISSES) What? (CHUCKLES) Come on, Shadow. Come on. THOMAS: As of this day, Thomas Montgomery, 47 years old, ceases to exist. He's replaced by a 20-year-old, battle-scarred marine. All paperwork, birth certificate, social security card, is set. He is strong, good-looking, and battle-hardened. He has money in the bank. 2.5 million dollars. He is six feet, two inches tall, 200 pounds. He's a great lover. And he's moving to Indiana to be with the love of his life. I don't know, Amanda. Normally, he's not the most talkative man in the world, but lately he's been so distant. If he's not at work, he's either exercising or walking the dog. And if he's not doing those things, he's on the computer playing his poker. You've been complaining about this for a while now, Carol. I know. Because I'm waiting for him to get out of this funk, but... You think it's a midlife crisis? If it is a midlife crisis, I wish he would hurry up and get into old age. I don't know. It's like there's something not right with him these days. When's the last time you two had... Don't even ask. (STAMMERS) I hate to bring this up at all, but, uh... I mean, have you considered that maybe he's having an affair? (CHUCKLES) Thomas? When would he even have the time? I don't know. Becoming emotionally distant, exercising? Spending hours online? It is the digital age. You... You don't have to leave your house to have an affair. No. Not Thomas. I know him too well. Nobody ever really knows anyone, Carol. Amanda. We have been married for almost 18 years! My point precisely. It's, uh... Maybe you're right. Maybe he is just spending time playing poker with his buddies. Maybe it is just a midlife crisis, but if it were me, I'd do a little detective work the next time I was home alone. Honey, it's better to know for sure one way or another, right? (CHUCKLES) BRIAN: That's it. (ALL LAUGHING) ALL: Oh! Nice! His luck. It's like playing with a robot or something. Yeah, what's the deal, Thomas? Where's all the gloating we've come to expect when you take our money? Sorry, fellas. I, uh, I guess I'm just a little tired. That's all. That's what happens when you stay online past your bedtime. Ooh. You know, maybe you're right. I think I'll have to leave a little early. Catch up on some shut-eye. Whoa. Come on. Don't... Don't... Don't be such a wimp. Let's play a few more hands, at least. What's the deal, Thomas? You're acting like you're gonna be late for an important meeting or something. (SIGHS) Okay, fine. Just deal... Deal the damn cards. RAY: Attaboy! MAN: Yes! Carol. Amy. Stacey. Shadow. Semper fi? Oh. (ECHOES) Would you pass the meatloaf, honey? Honey? What? Would you pass the meatloaf? Thank you. You okay? Sure. Yeah, I'm okay. STACEY: So, what about the talent show? THOMAS: Carol? Carol? Oh, there you are. Going to bed already? Huh? Mmm-hmm. Guess I'll play a few hands with the boys, then, okay? Sure. All right, then. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (DIALING) KATIE: Hello? (CHUCKLES) Oh. Tommy? It's so great to hear your voice, baby. You too, Tommy. Why are you whispering like that? It's late here. I'm not supposed to be calling outside the base. I might have to hang up in a moment's notice, just so you know. Okay. Okay? Okay. Baby, I can't stop thinking about you ever since you sent that package. Mmm. (CHUCKLES) Maybe you could send another one? Anything for my brave soldier. Why can't you send me something special? Oh, there's nothing but sand and rocks here, Katie. Mmm-hmm. But when I get home, I'll send you something. Better yet, I'll bring it to you. (LAUGHS) I think I know what you're talking about. No. (SNICKERS) No. What? It's not what you think, Katie. I... Oh, you're so bad. Tell me. Hmm. Let me finish. I love you, Katie. You give my life meaning. I... I'd die out here if it wasn't for you, and I'm not about to let that go. Tommy. When I get back... Will you marry me? (GASPS) Yes! Oh, my God, yes! Yes, I will! I'm gonna make you so happy. I promise! I know you will, baby. I know you will. Oh, I love you, Tommy. I love you so much! Tommy, there's so much that we're gonna get to do together. That's great, baby. That's great. But I gotta go before they catch me, okay? Oh, okay. Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. All right. I love you. I love you, Katie Brooks. I'll be Katie Montgomery soon. I'm so excited, Tommy. I love you so much. Look, I gotta go, baby. Okay. Bye. Bye. Oh, cool! Mom's home early! Hey. Hi, Mom. Hello. What are you doing home so soon? Have a seat, Thomas. What's wrong? What happened? A seat. Am I not tall enough for you, Thomas? What? Maybe I'm not hot enough. I'm certainly not blond enough, either. Mom, are you okay? Girls, would you leave us alone for a little bit, please? What's going on? Do what your father says, Stacey. Why don't you and Amy take Shadow for a walk, okay? Your father and I need to talk. Come on, Amy. I'll let you hold the leash. I had a feeling, but I didn't want to believe it. I couldn't... How could you, Thomas? Oh, it's not what you think, Carol. Oh, stop it, Thomas! I've read it all! You've been doing this for months, and saving all of the e-mails and messages and the pictures. (STAMMERS) I know what I did. It's not right. It's not fair to you. But come on, Carol. It's not like... It's not like I cheated on you. I never even met the girl. I don't want to hear it, Thomas Montgomery! You can deny it to yourself all you want, but you had an affair. And of course you didn't meet her, you son of a bitch. Then you'd have to admit the truth about who you are. (STAMMERS) No. No, you've got to understand, Carol, it's got nothing to do with you. How could you say that! It's got everything to do with me! No. I love you and the girls. You know that. But it's, uh, it's not you. It's not. I couldn't help it. She just started to talk to me and this and that, and it was innocent at first, but she kept at it. Oh, don't try to blame her, Thomas! You were the adult here! At least you were supposed to be. Well, why don't you try being an adult now and you tell me, why? I don't know. I honestly don't know. I got caught up in it, and... I... I can't explain it, Carol. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I feel... (STUTTERS) It just didn't turn out... I just wanted something that would... Mmm... You wouldn't understand. I have been beside you for almost two decades, Thomas. Sharing the burdens of this life. The disappointments. You think I don't understand? (EXHALES) I... I... Don't bother with the tears. And don't expect any from me. I've known about this for days, and I've cried my tears alone in our bedroom while you've been out here... Playing at love with this girl. I'm so sorry, Carol. You should be. You should also be ashamed of yourself. That little girl is only 18 years old. She could be your own daughter. It's bad enough you had an affair... But what you did to her... It sickens me. You sicken me. Oh. What are you gonna do? I should kick you out of the house right now, but for the sake of the family and for the sake of pure economics, I'm not gonna make you leave. But you're gonna have to find somewhere else to sleep. Okay. I'm so sorry, Carol. I will do anything. I don't know how I'm gonna explain this to the girls without breaking their hearts. Oh, oh. (STAMMERS) I made a mistake, Carol. I know that, but... Please, just give me a chance. But there is one more thing. The girl. I'll... I'll... She thinks Tommy's at war. I'll kill him. I'll just, I'll kill him, Carol. And she'll be sad for a bit, but she's young. She'll survive it. You think that you can cover up your lies with more lies? What is wrong with you? Well, what do you expect me to do? I don't expect you to do anything. I already took care of it. What did you do, Carol? (EXHALES) CAROL: Katie, enclosed is a picture of my family. The girls are my daughters, age 11 and 13. The woman is me. The that you see is Thomas Montgomery. We've been married for over 17 years. Nearly as long as you've been alive. We don't have a son. There is no Tommy. I've read the correspondence that you and Tommy have had over the last year. My husband has been lying to you. Playing with your emotions this entire time. I'm not writing this to hurt you, even though it might. I'm writing this so that you can know that the fantasy is over and move on with your life. Do not trust words on the computer, Katie. Unfortunately for us, we are living in the real world, and I have to see the real deceiver every day and deal with his behavior and lies. Carol Montgomery. Oh, my God. What have I done? (EXHALES) (INAUDIBLE) Good night, honey. Good night, Dad. Good night, peanut. Come here. You know I love you girls, don't you? Very much. We love you, too, Dad. We love you. Are you gonna sleep in the garage again tonight? Yeah. How much longer is it gonna be like this? Well, I don't know. As long as it takes, I guess. But I promise you, I will never leave you two, okay? Ever. Okay. Good night. Love you. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) What? I don't know... Is that couch uncomfortable? Oh, you know it. But I'm okay. I'm just glad I get to stay under the same roof, so... I'll see you in the morning. Good night, Carol. Good night, Thomas. Hello. Hello. You go out to lunch and you come back with flowers. Secret admirer? These are for you. What's this? Hey, is Thomas still in the dog house? No, my dog's in the dog house. Thomas is in the garage. Oh. Well, he should have been sending you flowers weeks ago. What's wrong? I can't believe I forgot. (SHADOW BARKING) (INDISTINCT) (EXHALES DEEPLY) Just a few hands. No harm in that. What the hell? Oh. (SIGHS) Come on, come on, come on. (MUMBLES) I'm so sorry, Katie. I know it was wrong. I'm sorry. You made me feel special. Never to hurt you. Oh. Tommy loved you, too. Please. Mmm. Can we stay friends? (CHUCKLES) Okay. Hello, Katie. My name is Thomas Montgomery. I'm 47 years old. Nice to meet you! I missed you so much. Oh. I gotta go. Bye, Katie. Good night, honey. Mmm. Hey. Look, Thomas, I, uh... I just wanted to let you know that I've been chatting with Katie a lot the past few days. And, uh, I hope you're cool. What do you mean? We're friends, Thomas. I don't want a girl to come between us. But at the same time, I... I want to let you know that I... I really like her, man. She's not just some conquest to me. I want you to know that. She said that you and her were, you know, okay after you... After what happened. I just want that to be the same with us, too. Hey, everything's cool. It's all fine. Okay? You all have yourselves a virtual good time. I'll probably see you online tonight, okay, man? Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right. I'll, uh, I'll see you later. Come on. Come on! (SCOFFS) Maybe. He's not real. ...you doing this to me? ...tramps. (SIGHS) You will regret it! He's not what he seems, stupid girl. He does this all the time. Of course I do. Of course. ...you do this, Katie. Fine! (BANGING ON TABLE) It's really hot in here, Thomas. I know. Maybe... You should come inside, in the air-conditioning. Come to bed, Thomas. I can't sleep with you standing there like that. Good night, Carol. Good night, Thomas. (KATIE GIGGLING) BRIAN: Katie. Hmm. KATIE: Oh, Brian. Morning, girls. BOTH: Morning, Mom. BRIAN: The things she sends me, it's... It's kind of hard to believe she's really a virgin. MAN: Not for long. BRIAN: Well, don't get me wrong. I'm looking forward to that, too, I feel like this one's different. Feel like there's something real there, you know? Come on, man. I hear all of your stories at lunch. Yeah, that's just talk. It's all B.S. I... I really like this one. MAN: We'll see if you're singing the same tune come Monday. BRIAN: All right. Good luck, man. BRIAN: Thanks. You son of a bitch! Hey! Hey, stop it, Thomas! Take it easy! Screw you! Hey, what the hell is wrong with you? I heard you! I heard what you said about her! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) Hey, hey, I... I'm sorry, man. You... You okay? Don't touch me! Well, you've lost it, man! You really have. She's just a kid! Well, to you, she is. And she warned me about you. Says you're crazy. She's been trying to get me to tell everyone that you're some kind of pervert, but I wouldn't do it 'cause I thought it wasn't true. 'Cause I thought we were friends. You can't do this to me, Brian! Hey! You're in love with someone that's not real, Thomas! It never was! You need to calm yourself down, take it easy, think straight! I swear to God, Brian... Hey! FOREMAN: What the hell is going on here? Nothing. It was nothing, Al. Get back on the floor, Brian. No, seriously, Al... Now! Anybody else would be out in the street. But you've given us years of good work, Thomas. But these last few months and now this? I know. I'm sorry, Al. You're skating on thin ice around here. Don't give me an excuse to fire you, because I just might take it. I have a teenage daughter myself. Don't look at me like that. It's a small town, even smaller company. People talk. I want you to go home. Use the weekend to get your head together, all right? And, Thomas... Don't screw up like this again. You understand me? Yeah. All right. Oh, I'm so stupid. Ah! Stupid. Stupid! (CHUCKLES) (GROANS) (SCREAMS) (MUMBLING) Katie. Please. Are you seeing him? Come on! Tell me. Tell me. Stupid girl. Talk to me. I know this guy. He doesn't love you! Please. Please talk to me. (GROANS) Fine. Whore. I tried to warn you. Payback's a bitch! (SCREAMS) God. (PHONE RINGING) Dr. Thompson's office. Hold on. It's Thomas. Oh. Yeah? Friday night's billing, you know I get out later. What? Extra shift? You never work a... Surprise? What kind of surprise? Well, I don't even know if I can get out early enough to pick up the girls. Okay. Amanda says she'll cover for me. No. It's cool. I understand. Okay. I'll see you then. Working an extra shift, hmm? Are you sure that's what he's doing? Yeah, I am. He's really... I don't think he has it in him to do anything stupid anymore. (YELLS) (GRUNTS) (CHUCKLES) (CELL PHONE CHIMES) (CAR LOCK BEEPS) (GRUNTS) WOMAN ON TV: The African lion... Mmm, that one's so cute. Hmm. Aw. There's my girls. What was that for? Motivation. Come on, let's get out of here. What? Where are we going, Daddy? It's been too long since we've gone and done something as a family, don't you think? I say this weekend we go camping. Up at the lake, just like old times. Really? Oh, Thomas, you can't be serious. I am serious as a heart attack. I told you. I told you I had a surprise for you this weekend. Go get your swim gear and put your boots on! Chop, chop! Come on! Good girls. Thomas, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm better than I've been in a long time. Yeah, but this is just... It's so late. No, we... We can be there in an hour. I'll get the fire going and put up the tents while you and the girls are making s'mores. Come on. It'll be fun. I just want us... ...to be together again. Just once. Hmm? Nothing wrong with a little spontaneity, right? I thought you ladies liked that kind of thing. Yeah, we do, but this is kind of crazy. (CHUCKLES) Well, that's... That's just why you like it, isn't it? Come on. Come be crazy with me. You go pack a bag. I'll get some food, okay? Don't just stand there! Come on! Ow! We're never gonna get there in time if you don't pick it up! * Lost my keys, spent all my money * But I just don't worry, it's kind of funny * Now, I believe in love... AMY: I don't want it black. It caught on fire. It wasn't my fault. It was your fault, Stacey. Why is it my fault? I can just blame it on you. STACEY: Get mine golden brown. AMY: Ah! Ah! The bug will bite you. I don't know what's gotten into you, Thomas Montgomery. You think the girls are asleep? For sure. It's been such a full day. Are you tired? I should be, but I'm not. I'm actually feeling relaxed. That's good. That's good. What are you doing? Thomas. Oh, Thomas. CAROL: This is so nice. I'm glad you were so spontaneous. Yeah. (CHUCKLES) And last night... You think you can do it again tonight? We've got some lost time to make up for, you know. I hope so. I really do. BOY: Guys! (POLICE SIREN WAILING) What do you got? M.E. puts the time of death somewhere between 9:00, 9:30, Friday night. COSTA: Now he was texting at the time. A girl with an Indiana area code. Hi. Can I help you? Yes, ma'am. Are you Katie Brooks? Yeah. I have a few questions for you. Okay. Katie, who is it? Um, I don't know. What's, uh, what's going on? What is this? Katie, what do you know about Brian Barrett of Rivershore, Michigan? (INAUDIBLE) Thomas, you almost done? Yeah. Come on, Dad! I'm coming. Sit there, now. Sit there. Hey, girls. Wake up. We're home. Who's that? THOMAS: Shadow, stay. Thomas Montgomery? Yeah. Detective Moretti. Detective Costa. Rivershore Homicide. Homicide? Why? What... What happened? What's going on? We're investigating the shooting death of one of your husband's co-workers. A Brian Barrett. What? Brian? Oh, God. No. Oh, it can't. I'm terribly sorry you had to hear the news like this, ma'am. You also knew the deceased? Yes. Yes, we all knew him. He was a family friend. I don't understand. Why are you here? We want to ask your husband here a few questions. Oh, Thomas? He wasn't involved in this. He and Brian were friends. They play poker together. Okay, there must be some mistake. Thomas has been with his family all weekend camping. Well, Brian was shot around 9:00 p.m. Friday night. Thomas was working then. Ma'am, Brian was killed in the Grant Abrasives parking lot. No. That... That... It can't. We understand that you had an altercation with Brian at the site of the murder, Friday morning. What? What are they talking about? Carol, would you take the girls inside while I talk to the detectives? You're gonna have to come with us, Mr. Montgomery. What's going on here? What did you do? Take care of the girls. I love you. I always have. Don't ever think I didn't. Daddy, what's going on? (SHUSHING) I love you, girls. I'm sorry. Mom, what are they doing? Why are they taking Dad? Mom? Let's go. COSTA: Crime of passion. Happens all the time, Thomas. Things will go easier if you just tell us what happened. We've got motive. These files from Brian and Katie's computers lay it all out. Your foreman at your work saw you attack Mr. Barrett. Your wife tells us that you own an M1 rifle like the one that killed him. It's only a matter of time before we find it, Thomas. Now, come on. Your cooperation will go a long way when this goes to trial. I think it's best that I wait for my legal counsel to arrive. Fine. We can wait, too. Right? And in the mean time, you should take another look at that tall, hot blonde. That's not necessary. She's a beautiful, young thing. Who's this? This is Beth Brooks. It's Katie's mother. Come on. You think you're the only one that lied about themselves on the Internet? Huh? MAN ON TV: Sorry. The actual retail price is... Stop. (CHUCKLES) Mom! Smile for the camera! Yes! God, yes! I love you, Tommy. (SIGHS HEAVILY) OFFICER: What do you know about Brian Barrett of Rivershore, Michigan? I don't know who that is. I don't... Mom? Oh, my God! Mom. Oh, my God! Thomas here just figured it all out. I'm gonna leave this here with you. Your lawyer will be in, in a minute. Mmm.
