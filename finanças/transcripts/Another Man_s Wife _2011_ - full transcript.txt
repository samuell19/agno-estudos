It's been said that coincidences are just routine patterns we haven't yet realized, but sometimes, in the midst of chaos, routine is what keeps us sane. Every day we take the same way to work, through the same roundabout, drinking the same coffee, to the same job, and starting it all over the next day, hoping something will be different, but the circle continues to turn. Strengths, weakness, opportunities, threats. The SWOT model is not just a business plan. It's a life plan. And life is something I have always planned out to the minute, - leaving nothing to chance. - Mom! I dare you to be late. Oh, no, I've got to get to work, gotta shake the money maker. You're evil. You know that? There's no rest for the wicked. Boo. Jerk. Were you looking for this, this morning? Oh, now I'm the jerk. Yes, you are. Oh. Oh, this must've cost a fortune. Oh, you're worth it. Here. Oh, why are you so good to me? I don't know. Must be all those little things I love about you, huh? What do you think? Like what? Like what? Hm. Well, let's see. I love the fact that you eat cereal with a fork because you don't like the taste of milk. I love the fact that you always have to have one leg outside of the covers at all times, and I love that you say "fustrated" instead of "frustrated." Oh. I know I've been really distant lately. - Mm. - Thank you. You're welcome. You should wear that at all times so people know someone loves you. I will. And there's more. - More? - Yes. Champagne mimosa for the lady, a little orange juice for the man. I don't have to drink this. No, no, drink up. Hey, to new beginnings. Happy anniversary. Happy anniversary, honey. - Mm. - Mm. All right, now, for the truly important question of the morning. Mm. Do all of these incredibly romantic gestures get me any action? Well, yeah, but later, sailor. Come on, Had, 20 minutes, 20 minutes, 10... - Uh-uh. - Five. I would love to, but I have a presentation first thing this morning. Hm. Well, Hadley, funny thing about that presentation. I am your presentation this morning. It's our anniversary. I knew I'd have to schedule myself in there somehow, so I ask you. Did you really think you had a meeting with Hans Someman, Inc.? Hans? Handsome man. "Handsome man..." that was the best you could come up with? Sad, but true. Yeah. All right, well, you got your 20 minutes. Hey, I only need five minutes, sweetheart. No, I want the full 20. Twentyight. It's my birthday. Mom, come on. We're going to be late. Coming. Fifteen minutes late. You're never even 15 seconds late. Wait, you got some. - What? No. - You did. - You did. - Um, sick people, I'm right here. Sky, your parents have been married 18 years. When sex happens, it's monumental. You know what? I think we should rethink carpooling with Aunt Lis'. What do you say, Sky? Is that a hickey on your neck? No. But you looked, which implies... Sick. It's good seeing you guys back together again. Yeah. If anyone took the time to sit down and watch us, and I mean really watch us, they would see no coincidence, no change, and an easy, predictable, traceable routine, a breathing version of connect the dots, but every so often, fate gives us a nudge, like a giant elbow to our skipping record... just to make sure we're still alive. Mom! Oh, come on, Skylar. I said pack for one week, not three, honey. A woman has her needs, Dad. What did you pack in here, dumbbells? You boys fear a strong woman. Don't you, Dad? You're scary, how much you and your mother are alike. You know that? Did you get my overnight bag? If by overnight bag, you mean these two suitcases and the one in the car, yes, you're ready to go. Did you turn off the coffee machine? Yes, I did. - Yes, yes... - Hm. Best vacation ever. Now we're going to our favorite getaway, far from the memories of the accident and our separation... "...but we do have high forest fire risk... hopefully to become a family again. We should really be there by now. Don't worry. We're almost there. Do you want me to drive? Mom, how do you manage to get us lost every year? Yeah, this is us. So? Huh? Good idea? Good idea. I love the mountain air. Yeah. Sometimes it's nice not always being the one behind the plans, isn't it? Yes. Do they have Wi-Fi up? - Uh, I'd lean towards no. - Are you going to survive? Barely. They better have cable. Come on, guys, no busy work schedules, no plans, no stress. Just us, huh? We have a new TV... Oh, my God. Is that a VHS? Uh, um... You okay? Yeah. I know I've got this down right. You know, you probably didn't. Let me try. All right. Of course, why would I have written it down right? See, I think that's a two. See? Oh... Oh, look at that. Between the two of us, we are absolutely no good. Mwah. Hello. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to... No, no, no, it's okay. We didn't know anyone else was up here. Hey, Al Paunovic. Staying next door. Uh, where's Bob Hamilton? He's visiting his son for a couple of weeks. I'm just staying at the property, helping fix things up. Oh, great. Hey, I'm Brian. This is my wife Hadley, my daughter Satan there. - Dad. - Brian. - Skylar. - I like that name. You guys having troubles with the door? Yeah, I don't know what's going on. Let me see. Okay, hang on. Think he's coming back with a banjo or a knife? Universal key. You're a locksmith? I am a fireman, and this can open any cottage, townhouse, condo, lockbox from here to L. A. Okay, a little unnerving, but in this case, glad you're here, Al. Okay. Welcome to Stillwater Cove. Anything you guys need, you let me know. - All right, thanks. - All right. Thanks. You behave. Uh, no bars in sight. Sky, you're 17. Dad, I mean cellular bars, which means... - Which means... - Oh. My life is over. Oh, I can't get used to that. I'm getting the bags. Might work upstairs. I love this place. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Hm, welcome. Oh. I told them to get rid of all of that stuff. I believe you. Hadley, I didn't. Okay. Happy? Wait till you see the renovated bedroom. Don't get ahead of yourself. You tease. - Hey. - Why are you smiling? Huh? Endorphins. Did I hear there's smiling? That can't be right. That would mean you guys are actually having fun. Come on. You've got to admit this was a good idea, right? Fishing for complements again. Fishing... that is something we are going to do on this trip, you and me. I don't fish. Yes, dear, it was a good idea. Thank you, honey. I appreciate the support. Mm, you smell nice. Hey, Sky, why don't you see if you can scrounge up some firewood in the back yard. We'll have a bonfire later. If it's 'cause of what I think it is, then no. - I will help you. - Hey, hey. - Later. - Oh, sick. Come on. Mom! Hey. You know they put peeping Toms in jail. You scared me. Wait. I'm sorry. My bad. It's okay. And about earlier, I should've closed the curtains. I don't... It's okay. I'm not shy, and someone as beautiful as you just, you caught me. Oh, no, no, I wasn't... I mean... thank you. Okay. You guys all settled in? Mom? Mom! Oh. I've got to go. Okay. Well, if there's anything you need, anything, you just let me know. - Okay. - Okay? My door is always open. Okay, thanks. Bye. I think that's enough, Dad. Hey, come on. Go big or go home. - Right? Right? - Home would be good. You know, Sky, I think you can go a week without a cell phone. Maybe you can. I can't. All right, watch out. Get ready for the fireworks. Yah. - Well, hey. - Go bigger, go home. - Not bad. - Yes. Thought it would be a little bigger than that. All right. Thanks. It's a good fire, Dad. - So... - Who's hungry? Hey, there she is. Ew, do we even know what's in those? That's half the fun. No, what's in a hotdog? Oh, don't overanalyze. Yeah, she's your mother's daughter, right? Besides, I'll tell you what, Sky. You and I tomorrow morning are going to go fishing, and we will have something a little less nitrate-cicle I don't fish. Since when don't you go fishing? You used to always go fishing with me. I'm not 10 anymore, Dad. You're still my little girl whether you like it or not. I'm not that little either. All right, you know what? I will go fishing tomorrow by myself, I will have a fabulous time, and you'll just have to put up with my crying myself to sleep again. Aw... Oh, poor Dad. Poor Dad. All right, here, put your own next to here. The Three Musketeers again. To the Warners, huh? May this little getaway bring us back together again. All right? Hey, guys, I'm sorry, but there's a fire ban. Just one ember can send the entire hillside up in seconds, and with all that dry underlay on the forest floor, it's like a matchbox on the ground. We could all be burned alive, and we wouldn't want that. Sorry, gotta be safe. Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't know. No, no, I'm sorry for having to be the literal wet blanket. Um, tomorrow night, what do you say, my place? I'll cook or just attempt to. - Uh, great, thanks. - Yeah. Yeah, thank you. All right, so change of venue, huh? Let's... Ow, my... ouch. You all right? You need a hand? Nope, nope. What happened? Oh, it's just an old sports injury. I used to play a little ball in high school. That's all. What were you, quarterback? No, linebacker. The most important position to winning the game. And what were you, the head cheerleader? What, me? What... Don't laugh. No, actually I was more like a... A nerd. Yeah. I wish the nerds at my high school looked like you. Looks like you got the best of both parents. Thank you. So I'll see you guys tomorrow night? We will. - Good night. - Good night. See ya. I can't get to the phone right now. Please leave a message. Hey, Dad, I know you can hear me. If you don't pick up... Hey, your son called. Sky? Skylar! Skylar! Skylar! Let her go! Let her go! Hey, leave her alone! Uh... - Mom. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I... I thought... Thought you were... Skylar, I thought you didn't like to fish. She does now. Uh... Ooh, I can't kill it. I know. I hate that part, too. Here, catch and release. Everyone should do it. Sorry if we scared you. No, that's okay. We've just been a little on edge these days. Yeah, Skylar mentioned something. She did? I'm going to go clean up. Al, thanks for the lesson. No prob. She's a good kid. She must get that from her mom. She has her moments. That is a beautiful necklace. Oh, thank you. Brian has his moments, too. It was an anniversary gift. Wow. He must really care. That's an expensive piece, even for an anniversary. You know your jewelry. Yeah, I know what I like. Skylar mentioned some problems, and I don't want to interfere or anything, but if you want to talk... Sometimes you forget the effect your relationship has on your kids. Mm-hm. Right. You remember that age being younger and not wanting to be talked down to and then you get older, and you want to be younger. Like you know anything about getting older. Like you do either. Touché. Well, I'll see you later. Hey, I'll see you tonight. - Oh, yeah, what time? - 7:00. Can we bring anything? Just you and your beautiful family. - Okay- - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. you don't want to come fishing with me? No, Dad, been there, done that. All right. I can't get to the phone right now. Please leave a message. Dad, I know you can hear me. Dad, if you don't pick up the phone, I'm coming up there. All right, I'm coming up there. I'll see you soon. - Why, yes. - Hi. - Come on in. - Thank you. Oh. - Let me take your coat. Thank you. There is the master fisherman. Fisherwoman. They're going to write books about me one day. I'd buy it. - Hey. - Hey. Thank you, sir. Al, nice. All righty, let's get this night underway. - Beer? - Oh, no, I'm good, thanks. Oh, come on, one's not going to kill you. Juice? - Yeah, that would be great. Thank you. - Cool. And what can I get you ladies to drink? Uh, whatever takes the pain away. The child will have water. Oh, and wine? That would be great. Thanks. All right. Wine for the lady, Mr. Brian. All right. Al, this is great. I see you've been clear cutting out there, huh? - Wow. - Yeah, the pine beetles have been eating the trees dry out from the inside out, kind of a fire hazard waiting to happen. Well, it smells delish. So that necklace, the diamond... Some nice work there. You saw that, huh? It's hard not to notice. Well, one of those things where I saw it, and I knew Hadley would love it, so why not splurge? Yeah. What did you do? What do you mean? Come on, no worries. Bro code. I won't say anything. Usually when I guy gets his girl something like that, he's done something. No, no, nothing like that. - No? - No. No, I love my wife, Al. I'm sure you do. What's not to love? Come on, we're guys. It happens. It's all right. Your secret's safe with me. No secret to tell, Al. You know? I mean... okay, honestly I was... drinking a little bit more than I should've. It was affecting things, and... Anyway. - Let me get that. - Cheers. - Whoa... - Oh, hey. Don't worry about it. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa... All right. That's one hell of a smoke detector you got there, Mr. Fireman. Yeah, I need to add that to my list. You do that. All right, here we go. - Oh. Thank you, honey. - You're welcome. - Thanks, Dad. - Here you go, sweet. Hey, Al, what is this? That is something I'm fixing up for the station. It's called RSD machine, so when you're stuck in traffic on a call, you can tap into people's radio frequencies, you know, tell them to move out of the way kind of thing. - Hm. - Huh. So you're obviously taking a little break. I am just up here researching, really. The fires have been spreading really quickly this year, so I've been working with the tri-counties to try to improve methods of prevention and awareness. I didn't know Bob rented this place out. I'm just helping him bring it up to code, sealing the windows, reworking the gas lines. I can... get that. No, I got it. Don't worry about it. Enjoy your wine. I'll be right back. Make yourselves at home. - Hey. - Hey. Who are you? I'm Al. Al. Robert. Where's my father? Your father? Um, this is his house. Well, I rented it from Bob Hamilton. He-He's your dad? Rented? Uh, yeah. My father lives here. He built this house himself. He only rents out next door. Well, I'm sorry, man. I don't know what to tell you. Well, is he here? He said he was going hunting. I don't know if that helps. No, he didn't say anything to me. Hm. You want to come in? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Oh. Jeez, I am so stupid. Sorry, he did mention that you might come by and that... Yeah, he left something for you in the freezer out in the garage. Oh, okay. Salmon, I think. Judging by all the photos, you guys like fishing, huh? Yeah, we used to. What the hell? I'm guessing you want to try that on. - For reals? - Absolutely. Anybody else want to try some stuff on? I'm good. I think I'll pass. Oh. Okay. Who was at the door? Just somebody looking for directions. Oh, we got lost, too. Mom's kind of a wrong-way Jones. - We did not get lost. - Little bit. We... You know what? Just let me make sure he made it out okay. Make yourselves at home. I don't know why I'm having flashbacks to "YMCA," but... Okay, then. That looks good on you. You're going to need this. Huh. You know, you're old enough now that you could be up here helping us fight fires in the summer. - Really? - Yeah, sure. Can always use a strong girl like you to help keep us guys in line. - No. - I hear you. If it gets her out of the house, I'm all for it. - No. - No? - No. - Apparently not. Brian, would you like to lead the prayer? Oh, uh, no. No, Al, you go ahead. - Please. - Okay. We thank you, God, for bringing together new friends and for those who have passed and for this wonderful feast on our table, and we thank you for keeping us safe as we walk our different paths of life, and we pray for you to continue to do so. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Let there be food. This looks really good, Al. - There you go. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Sleep well. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Good night, fisherwoman. Good night. Thank you. All right. Yep. - Thanks again. - My pleasure. Have you seen my cell phone? Uh, nope. Well, tonight was fun. I think Skylar officially has a new crush. Uh, yeah. What's up with you? Me? Nothing. Yeah? Usually "me nothing" means "me something. - Hm. - Nope. Why do you smell like alcohol? Oh, Al, he spilled a beer somewhere on my shirt. - It's just... - Yeah? Sure? Yeah, I'm sure, Hadley. You want to ask him? What did you guys talk about in the kitchen? Nothing, just, you know, guy talk. He didn't tell you anything interesting? Nope, just guy talk. Hey. Um. How come you always seem to find me without my shirt on? Oh, is that Celtic? Yeah, it's a traditional Celtic cross. Looks like it must've hurt. There were tears shed. How about you? You got any ink? Me? No, I'm just a boring housewife. I don't see anything boring about you. Besides your skin's too perfect to scar up anyway. That's a lie. It's very nice, but it's a lie. No, I'm serious. Any man would kill to have you. Your husband's a lucky guy. I hope he does everything to appreciate that. He does. Yeah. Oh, you know I... I hope you don't think that we were rushing off last night. No, it's your family thing. I don't want to get in the way, but you were looking at me yesterday. Don't make me call the cops. I wasn't. Okay, it was more of a leer than a look. A leer? No, I'm happily married. For how long? Oh, we've been married for 18 years. How many happy ones? I got to go. Hey, um, Brian mentioned some drinking. I grew up in that household, so I know what it's like the trust broken over and over again, but deep down he's a good guy. He is. And I'm sor... I know I shouldn't, but, um... he's hiding something from you. You know that, right? I don't think I know what you're talking about. I think you do. I'm here if you need to talk. I don't. I've got to go. Hey. How was your run? You okay? Yeah. No. I don't know. What is it? You want to talk about it? I want you to talk. Okay. What do you want to talk about? What are you not telling me? What do you mean? Ever since the separation, I... I feel like there's something you're not telling me. Brian? Brian? I never thought you were coming back. You were the one who left. - Not because I wanted to. - Then why? Oh, come on. You know exactly why, Hadley. You stopped talking. You completely shut me out. You know that. We were like two separate people living two separate lives under one roof. We didn't hate each other. We didn't love each other. I never stopped loving you. What are you not telling me? We were separated. And I needed something. And if I couldn't have you, Hadley... Why didn't you tell me this before? Because we started to work things out between you and me, and it was good, and I hadn't felt that great in years. I lost you once, Hadley, and I promised myself I would never do anything again to lose you. That's why I didn't tell you. I'm sorry. It had just been so long, and... I needed to be needed. And if I couldn't be with the person that I wanted, then I could be with somebody who wanted me for a change. How long... How long was it going on? Couple of weeks. Maybe a month. Maybe longer? Maybe. I'm sorry. Look, we're here now. Right? We are right here. We're working on this, and I don't want to go back to the people that we were. I know it's a cliché to say that if I could go back and change everything, I would, but I would. And, um... there's one other thing. Something else? The woman in the accident... What about her? It was her. The woman that I hit is the woman you were having an affair with? I'm sorry. - How can that be? - I don't know. I don't. It was like a random coincidence. - I don't know. - There are no coincidences. You knew but you didn't tell me. What else are you not telling me? I swear, nothing. - Are you sure? - Yes. Oh, God... I-I need some air. Hadley, wait. Hadley. I'll never stop loving you. I don't believe you. Where's Mom going? Oh, she just went out to get some air, just... You're fighting again? Everything's going to be okay. All right? I'm going for a run. And the water shut off, for whatever reason. Yeah, I'll... get on it. I'm sorry. For what? That you had to find out that way. Look, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so just leave me alone. Look, I know you more than most. I know you need control just like I do, and I think that you're trying to figure out whether your life has become boring or whether it's you who's become so boring, and I think you've thought about me in ways that you think you can't and that scares the hell out of you more than anything in this world. Leave it alone. It or you? Are you telling me there's not even a spark here? Can't do this. Keep running. It's got you this far. Hi. How does anybody live up here? The mountain air... I don't... not good. You know, the isolation lets you be you, become who you want to be. Leave that... tom boy behind. Let Daddy's little girl... become a woman. I get it. You do? Yeah. I've had frustration, too. Living in the shadow of my father, Him a decorated war hero, me just some punk trying to be himself. Hey. I can tell you it all gets better, a lot better. I promise. Just don't let them take you from you. Don't let them. I've got to go. Any man would kill to have you. How is it you always seem to find me without my shirt on? Ever since the separation, I feel like there's something you're not telling me. He's hiding something from you. You know that, right? The woman that I hit is the woman you were having an affair with? I needed to be needed. We are right here, and we're working on this, and I don't want to go back to the people that we were. I will never stop loving you. Thought you guys were staying up the whole week. Going back early, beat the traffic. Traffic? Look around, man. The only traffic up here is you and me. You told her, didn't you? What goes on in my life is none of your business. How could you let that go? If I had someone like that in my life, I'd pull them in tight, and I'd hold them till I was too old to hold them anymore. I don't want you near my wife or daughter. Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot. Really? Well, to be honest, Al, I'm not too concerned about it. See you around, sport. You should really do everything and anything for someone like that. You honor that every moment you wake up and every time you go to sleep because either one day you won't wake up or you will, and she'll be gone. Are you threatening me or something? Is that what you think I'm doing? I honestly don't know what the hell you're doing. Whatever it is, it stops here. Now you're threatening me. I don't know. Is that what you think I'm doing, Al? Whatever it is you're doing, I suggest you go easy. - Really? - Yeah. You want to hit me, don't you? You need to leave now. Did you wife tell you she watches me in the shower? Brian! Dad. Oh, it's okay. We're going. Get your things. Why did you hit him? I'm sorry I caused you any trouble. Oh, my God. You know, we're just going through our own stuff right now. Yeah, well, nevertheless, I wish you the best. Daddy, why did you hit him? - Don't worry about it. - Are you okay? It's fine, all right? Don't worry about it. Now, get your things. We're leaving. I swear to God, Hadley, if he comes back I don't know what I'm going to do. - Okay. - What's going on? Just listen to your father and go get your stuff. No, I asked a question, and I want to be answered. Now now. You don't get it. Whatever. Kissing him... did that feel good? That make everything go away for you? He kissed me. - You didn't pull away. - Neither did you. You know what, Hadley? We were separated. It wasn't anything, Brian. And how would I know that? Huh? You never tell me anything about anything, Hadley. I mean, these walls talk more than you do. He's not the one I want. You kissed Al? No. He kissed me. Skylar? Skylar. Every time I close my eyes... that accident is there. I wake up hoping that it will go away, but it never does. Every time I hear a siren or tires screech, I'm right back, right there. I see her face over and over again. I see my hands on the wheel and I start wondering what if? What if... What if I turned just a little bit more to the left, or what if I hit a red light instead of a green light just a block back? You have no idea how many combinations of what if go through my mind on a... on a hourly... On a momentary basis. And then the whys start. Why her? Why me? Why does any of this have to happen? Why can't I get over it? Why can't I get out of the rut that I was in before and after the accident? When am I going to have a break from reality for a second, for a moment? So, yeah... you want full disclosure. There was a moment. There was a moment in that kiss And then it went away. Then there was my family, and then there was you. And I'm guessing that if anybody's going to understand, it's going to be you. Is that enough anything about anything? I'm sorry, Had. Me, too. You okay? Just tell me, are you and Dad getting a divorce? - No. - Never? We're working on making everything okay. Then why did you kiss Al? He kissed me. Come on. Let's go home. We have a lot to talk about. You're going to need to hear what I have to say. We're leaving. No, you're going to want to see this. Honestly. Why? What's happening? - We are in the middle of it. - Middle of what? Hell. A brush fire just sparked up south of the I-60 off of Logging Road. It is moving south by northwest, joined by divergent east winds coming through the valley there. - What does that mean? - The fire is circling us. - Circling? - Well, like hunting. Then we should leave now. It's already blocked the south here, right? It's moving at about 5 1/2 hours miles per hour. These things can eat anywhere between a hundred and a hundred thousand acres if it picks up fuel, and with all that dry underlay on the forest floor... It's like a matchbox on the ground. - Exactly. - All right, so what are we supposed to do? Okay, Old Logging Road... We move west through the forest. Can we stay ahead of the fire? Realistically, you won't see an inch of flame. Fire eats oxygen out of the air, so the smoke will be like breathing under water. You'll suffocate before you see any chance of fire. - How much time do we have? - Hours. Less. Can we wait it out in the water? The smoke will get you if the hypothermia doesn't, and getting down to the water right now, the tree line all along the lake is already on fire. It's literally circling us. We need to move. - Now. - All right, we go west. - Brian, I can smell the smoke. - Come on, follow me. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Brian? Skylar, run! Come on! Had, I can explain. Please, don't hurt my family. I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to kill them. Had, come on. Open up. No. No. The woman, Emma... She's your wife? Was. No, this can't be. You don't remember killing her, or you just don't believe it? No, she came out of nowhere. - It was an accident. - It was no accident! Yeah, it was an accident. You're aware how I can pry open a steel door, right? Like a cap off a beer bottle. You really think you can get past me, Had? I know I scare you, but you have nothing to fear, Hadley. - Hadley. - Brian. Let's go! Let's go! Run. Where to? Who knows? No roads out. No roads in. And if by some chance you did make it through the smoke, well, there's the fire! Yeah, you'll be back. Go on! Get in the car! Go on! Just drive. Let's go. Fire crews are asking residents to evacuate via West Logging Road 49. Damn it. Put a coat on. Well, his name's not Al Paunovic. Yeah, big surprise. It's Matthew Sorum. What? Did you say "Sorum"? Yeah, as in the Emma Sorum. No, that can't be. Yeah, the woman I hit is the woman you were with, and she also happens to be Al's wife. Hadley, that's not possible. I told you there are no coincidences. She meant to get hit, just like he meant to put us in this situation right now. Fire crews are working overtime to control the sub-slope fire around Stillwater Cove. Residents are being asked to take Logging Road West 49. Fire circle has established a perimeter around Stillwater Cove, meaning all residents will die before rescuers arrive. - Brian? - Does that sound about right, Hadley? You can get out and try on foot, take a different direction, but pretty soon it'll be like trying to find your way through complete darkness... on top of only having 60 to 90 seconds of breath time available, depending on which direction you choose. The smoke will be like... Like breathing under water. You'll suffocate before you see any hint of civilization. He's got us surrounded. What to do. What to do. Hm. I'd hate to be stuck in your position. You keep driving forward and you kill your entire family. I seem to be the only one who knows his way out of here. I also seem to be the only one trained to handle such a situation and in possession of the equipment to do so. What to do. Do we go back, wait for him to leave, and follow him out? Or do we keep driving and die? I guess I'm more of a question than an answer man right now, so, um... I'm heading out. It was... It was great meeting you guys. What do we do? We can't go back. No, we can't go back. Mom? Okay, strengths... There's three of us, there's one of him. Weaknesses... His knowledge of the terrain and the situation. Opportunities... we live. Threats? We die. - Mom. - Get in the car. - What? - Get in the car. We've got to go back. We die without oxygen tanks. We're going back? So what do we do? He's got to leave sometime. What if he already has? And if he hasn't, what do you think, he's just going to let us in? We haven't got a lot of options right now, Sky. If we just keep waiting, the smoke is just getting thicker and thicker. I don't think he's in there. - Do you see that? - Hm? What? I saw it, too, the curtain. He's in there. Listen, what if it's not us waiting him out? Okay, think about it. He's got the respirator gear in there. Why doesn't he just wait for the smoke to get thick enough that we can't breathe, and he just walks out leaving us? - He's not going to do that. - Why not? Because he wants to watch us die. He wants to do to us what he thinks we did to him. Well, whatever we do, we've got to do it now. Okay, Sky, you stay here. All right? Okay. - I love you. - We'll be back. How you making out there? I'm guessing you've already done your SWOT analysis, which is what brought you back here. Am I right? SWOT. Strengths... my ability to survive in any condition. Weaknesses... None. Opportunity... A sort of cremation, really. So no signs of a crime. Threat... I don't see anything there either. - You ready? - Yeah. So where could I be? Upstairs? Downstairs? Behind you! Psst. Behind you. Brian! Honey, get the tanks! You freak! Brian! Brian! Skylar. Fisherwoman. Hadley, I've got something to show you. You're going to want to see this. Hadley. Good girl. SWOT. Strengths... my ability to survive in any condition. Weaknesses... none. Don't touch her. Opportunity... Now. If you hurt her... Threat... eliminated! Best case scenario... How's this going to end up for you? A nationwide manhunt, living your life constantly looking over your shoulder. Al, please, don't hurt our daughter. She hasn't done anything to you. Brian took away your wife. You want to take away his. Then take me and leave my family alone. Emma was pregnant. It was a girl. She stepped in front of my car on purpose. None of this is our fault. For every action... there is a reaction. You take mine. I take yours. Al, listen, you let them go. All right? It's me that you want. Brian, what are you not getting? I'm going to keep you alive long enough so you can watch your wife and daughter die just like I had to. You were there? Yeah. I started watching her watch you. You think I wouldn't find out, or did you think I just wouldn't care? I've had a lot of time to think about what I would say at this exact moment, trying to figure out how I'd be feeling when I finally got to say it. Do you remember standing up there, at the alter? In front of our friends and family, and you were so nervous that you were blushing from head to toe. Us, just two stupid kids promising forever, not knowing what it meant. I've had a lot of things taken away from me, a lot, but no one, not you, not anyone can take that moment away from me. I'm sorry. I'm pregnant. Really? - A girl? - A girl. I always wanted a girl. It's Brian's. Does he know? Does he? What did you think, you'd just watch him, his life, his family, and it'd become yours? Is that what you think? Is your life so sad, so pointless, that you had to pretend to be some other man's wife? Is that what you thought? Emma! Emma, no! No! Emma, hold on. Emma. I want to die. Oh, no, God. Oh, no. No! And then when she wasn't there anymore, that just left you. Life's a vicious circle, huh? You can stop this. That's exactly what I'm doing. No! Brian, your propane tanks outside... They're going to come smashing through this window, on fire, destroying everything in their path. Their bodies will be cremated, just like Emma's. Do you really think this is going to bring her back? It's not about bringing her back. It's about getting back. What makes you think you can take a life and just go on living like it never happened, huh? This is not going to end well for you. It's not going to end well for you, Hadley. It's already not ended well for me. Everything I had, you took away from me. Now, look around. You got nothing, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. Run, Skylar! Run! Run! Run! You son of a bit... Brian. Brian. Brian. Baby, you've got to wake up. Brian. Thank God. Where's redial? Hadley, this is a surprise. Are you all having a great time? Help me. Please, help. Who is this? Where's Hadley? Why are you on her phone? My name is Robert Hamilton. He killed my father. Please, help me. Where are you? Stillwater Cove, the Hamilton House. Please, you have to help. Please, call for help. Breathe. Breathe, baby, breathe. Skylar. Fisherwoman. You know that in fires, more people are crushed to death by thehings they hide under than the actual fire? You're going to get the best of both worlds. I'm not going to lie. This is going to hurt. Don't breathe it in too deeply. I've personally done it. Which, while a cool little head buzz... will alter your metabolism and change your DNA. But we may be getting ahead of ourselves here. Getting kind of hard to breathe in there, huh? Yeah, fires eating up any O2 it can. Gasoline in an enclosed environment like that doesn't even need direct contact with the flame. Just the fumes could ignite at any moment. Good luck. Whoa. That was a close one, huh? Whatever we did, whatever, we can fix it. We can help you. What I got broke, you can't fix. Please, I... I will do anything that you want. I am doing what I want. Please, I don't want to die. Oh, nobody wants to die. Dying is not a choice, honey. You have the choice right now not to kill us. Please. It seems my choice is leaning slightly the other way, isn't it? Do yourself a favor and call your mama out here. You know, I can just wait right here... wait for the candle to catch the fumes. Tip her over, about right there. I'll walk right out of here. You... You go up like a Christmas Tree. And do yourself a favor and call your mama out here. Call your mom. Do it. Run, Mom! Run! Skylar? Run, Mom! Run! How brave of you, Hadley. A fire like this, you'll go up in flames. Those flames will jump to the yellow brick road and all the way back home to Skylar. What's your rush to die, Hadley? I don't want to die, but I'll do anything to stop you from hurting my little girl. How nice, Hadley, the brave little mother. When did you know, Al? Or should I call you Matthew? When did you first know that Emma stopped loving you? She never stopped loving me. Oh, but she did. She did, and that's what makes you and me the same. We both live the same nightmare. That is not true. You do not know me at all! Matthew, everyone deserves to be loved. Brian and Emma loved each other. What about us? Listen, I'll drop this candle if you don't stop. Stop. Matthew, what are we doing here? We don't need to resolve this with hate or with violence. I've seen the way you looked at me. I know you want to get even with Brian, so then do it. Do that thing that I know you really want to do. You don't know how it was. But I do. I'm the only one who knows. We shared the same deceit, the same lies, the same cheating, the same heartbreak. But we can heal together. We can take care of each other, Matthew. What do you think? Really? Let me take care of you. Okay? I know you like me. We can do it... together. Okay? Run! No! No! Brian! So Matthew... You're no fireman. Firemen save lives. They're heroes. You're no hero. You don't know what you're talking about. Nobody knows how it was for me. Is that right? What about Emma? Emma knew everything about you. Is that why she killed herself? I'd be worried about your family right now, Brian. There's enough propane in the air to blow up this entire house, you and your family. When the fire gets here, it's all over, man. Go. Go! Run! It's been said that coincidences are just routine patterns we haven't yet realized, but sometimes, in the midst of chaos, routine is what keeps us sane. Hey, Mom. Hi, Lisa. Hey, baby. How was your day? Torture. So I heard from Robert Hamilton today. I don't know where this family would be if he hadn't called you. You guys really saved our lives. Yeah, he really is a brave guy. - So sad about his father, though. - I know. But he said things are good and that he's rebuilding his dad's log house. - That's great. - Yeah. Yeah. Matthew Sorum is nothing but ashes now. I'm really glad you could come over for dinner tonight. Oh, of course. Hey, guys. Mwah. - How was your day, Sky? - Torture. Of course it was. So glad life is getting back to normal around here. All right, everyone, I have a little good news, a little bad news about this evening. The good news... There will be food. Yes. The bad news... It ain't going to be this chicken. Oh, Brian. Yeah, I got a little distracted watching the game on TV. Pizza, everyone? - That sounds good. - Pizza sounds great. Excellent. I want pepperoni. And every so often, fate gives us a nudge, like a giant elbow to our skipping record just to make sure we're still alive. - Cheers. - And we are. Closed-Captioned By J. R. Media Services, Inc.
