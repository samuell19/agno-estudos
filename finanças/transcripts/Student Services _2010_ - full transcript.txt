Devotional poetry is the most remarkable with Teresa of Avila. She had hoped for martyrdom which she believed would open the gates of heaven to her. ln this text by Teresa of Avila, we should listen for the extreme meaning, what l call the "art of stages." I'll explain: in a sentence such as this, "Often when a person is distracted and forgetful of God, His Majesty"... What's going on? - What's the matter? - l don't know. Call the fire department. Are you all right? You say you can't pay 15 euros a week for the cafeteria. 3 euros a meal can't be beat. That's 60 a month. Where do l find that? You can always sue your folks. People do, you know. They have to provide for you. It's your right. And your heaIth. So I'm reduced to that? Dad's a mason. Mom's a nurse. They would, but they can't. You say no to soup kitchens. l have no miracle solutions. l look too heaIthy; is that it? It's my fat cheeks? l thought we agreed, when you moved in, to share expenses. So lay off. Then you asked for haIf the rent. That wasn't the deal. You live here, you share. Not getting by? Eh, baby? I'll look for a second job. Too bad. Sure. Get a second job if you're broke. You're not hard enough. You smoked too much. Help me. What is it? - You didn't pay the electric? - Sure. Then what is it? You didn't pay? No. I'll pay tomorrow. With what?

A kiss. Okay, quick. You smell nice. You're Laura? Yes. Hello. Joe. What's this? l read it? ln front of you? "Hello, Laura." "First of all thank you for being 'on time." And if l'd been late? "Today we'll play together." "Read my letter to the end, following instructions." "First, l want you to undress entirely." This is why l don't like professionals. They don't look innocent like you. "Now take a shower. Then l will." "Thank you for being here." You really excite me. Now here's how it goes. l love playacting. l fantasize about it a lot. Come over here. Caress yourseIf for me. Stroke yourseIf like it was the first time. Touch yourseIf more. Excite me more. l can't. l can see that. l understand. You're more the type to be dominated. Come sit beside me. I'll take over. Sit down. We'll talk. How old are you exactly? What are you studying? Applied foreign languages. Freshman year? Why are you here today? You know why. Got anyone in your life? Your family from here? You were born here? No, I'm here for school. ls the money for you? It's good, what you're doing. l also have people who depend on me. I'm divorced. l have a daughter a bit older than you. l remarried a very beautiful woman. It's been a while now... - And my fantasies... - Don't tell me about your life. You're right. It's not the same. We combine business with pleasure. Right, Laura? l don't fantasize about Lolitas. Next time, I'll bring you something. You'll like it. You can get dressed. I'm delighted, you know. Our first contact was super. l enjoyed it. You're magnificent. l didn't expect someone like you. You're sensitive. You're attractive. l really appreciate it. Thank you, Laura. How about a karaoke? - Where you going? - To work. - What do l owe you? - 27 euros. - With the cr?pe? - Everything. Thank you. - You okay? - Yes. The cort?ge... and the crematorium. Yes, ma'am.

They're relocating some to the Limoges plant. But I'm not wild about moving. I'll check with my colleagues. Why are you here tonight? ln this restaurant? No. Here with me. Why looking for a "masseuse"? How can l put it? It's complicated. l've never done this before. - It's the first time. - But why, I'm asking? I'm married to someone really nice. As for the sex, l don't understand what's wrong. It's complicated. At first, l thought it wouldn't last, you see? We've been married a year, but nothing's new in our sex life. She keeps pushing me away. l don't dare say anything or force her. l don't have many friends for advice. So my marriage... A marriage without sex is friendship, not a couple. Say it; you're starved for sex. Yes. Let's go. - Now? - Sure. We've talked enough. But where? You have money for a hotel? I'm pretty stressed out. Maybe if you undressed... I'll put on the heat. Would you mind... helping me? Please? Sorry. Forgive me. Do l pay you now? 1 40 euros, right? Manu? What? You pinched a slice of ham? l don't know. Maybe the other day. Then replace it. I'm starved. Not even any ham. Look at me. What? Mom's invited you for Christmas. Stupid jerk. What's the matter? l got raped to pay your fucking rent! Don't get sordid. The stuff she comes up with. "She" is leaving. It's over. No more swiping ham. What's this game? It's not. It's over. l got a tree. Daddy got a tree. Sorry, but it's 10:00 a.m. How are you? Say good morning. That's sweet. Let's decorate the tree. That's not funny! Now wash your hair. Stop fooling around. I'm fed up. Wash your hair. Do as l say. l left the corrected exercises in the kitchen. For you. A gift. No, l said. Relax. Have a drink. It's on us. l don't want it. We're out tonight. Have a drink. We've got time. Whatcha doing? You've never had exams to take. For what? You got that wrong... That's not right. Sorry I'm late. It was hard to find cigarettes. It's Prince Charming. We'll offer you a drink. Have a drink. What's your name? Benjamin. I'm only on my third whiskey and Coke. l think l can say that you're very... How can l put it? You already find me pretty? After three whiskeys? l found you pretty an hour ago. Maybe even longer than that. l can help you study for your exams, if you want. l don't know. How do you rank? My rank? Top rank. It's fine. So after the water damage, the insurance claim and all that... So l moved back in with my folks. It's well heated. You don't make any money? Make what? - Money... - Okay, l get it. Money. Sure. Sometimes. So you have work? Some work, some unemployment. This is it. Here we are. So l don't have your number. l told you, l don't have a phone. What? I'll call you. When? After my exams. How low can you go!? Tell me instead, "After l dump my boyfriend." "After my exams.. ." Help! I'll call you. Another try. We'll get there. Come on, relax. Look at me. Look at you. You're not exciting. Try to... Be less of a lump. More sex. Sexier. There you go. Good. Open your mouth. Move. Move. Nice. Okay, baby. l've got what l need. Get dressed. If you want to make a hit, don't be afraid to be a bit sleazy, a bit smutty. Think of the girl who likes that. You have something all your own. Use it. l don't plan to make a career of this. What do you want to do? Be a translator or interpreter, to travel. No connection. You're not Kate Moss either. But l may have something for you... If you need more. I'm telling you because l like you. It's a great deal. A client is looking for a girl just like you. It's for a threesome. Nothing too nasty. It's just him, a nice guy, and another girl like you, a college student. You let the girl lick you off while the guy pulls his pud. Who's the girl? How should l know? Some slacker after some easy cash. You interested? No. No. You pose for photos. That's different. Posing occasionally is okay, but no one touches my body. l don't want to. Don't be so fussy. You'll see a pair of shoes in a shop window and call me back for the guy's number. He pays 200 euros... An hour! l don't give a damn. "Student prostitution" "l took the plunge long ago.

But you should see her drool when l come home with a Chanel bag. Check out my bag. lsn't it awesome? - It's gorgeous. - l can't complain. My girIfriends tell me it beats being a checkout girl. l have to hang up. See you, maybe. Where do the shirts go? The closet in the bedroom. You like it here? The apartment... Not much... It's fancy. If it's cramped at your friends' place, l have a spare bedroom. What do you mean? The big bedroom. The guest room. At the other end. Completely independent. What's the rent? It's free. You understand? If you like, it's a popular sharing arrangement. l think. You offer a room and access to the common areas. ln exchange, we have a good time once in a while. Good time? Yes. Depending on the arrangement. For instance, with the girl before you, it was four times a month; I'm not greedy. It was a good deal for her, but then she met a guy. Think you might be interested? l don't know. I'm going to dust. l have class in an hour. Think it over? I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore. "For rent: maid's room." "Rent: 300 euros, deposit: 250 euros" I'll call you. - I'm right here. - I'll call you.

What are you going to do for your 1 9th birthday? What have you planned? Nothing special. I'll be working. Go up ahead of me. This is the last time, Laura. Come in, master. No laughing. Lie on the bed on your stomach, crosswise. Now let your head drop and feel under the bed. You'll open it later. Sit beside me. l can't. It's not my thing. What if it's mine? I'm going to tie you up today. l feIt you might like it. Don't worry, Laura. Not too tight? See? It doesn't hurt. What's wrong? l thought you liked submission. You leaving? We said two hours. You still have an hour. It's my birthday today. My friends are waiting for me in a caf?. l should have warned you. Don't take it so bad. It was just a little fantasy. Not showering? No, I'm going. You forgot this. It was good. l liked it. You knew it was my birthday? No. Don't feel like it? You're strange. You can't? Have your period? You don't want to make love? l do. What's the matter? l don't know. You do know. Tell me what it is. Some kind of a block? ls it me? What is it? You looked so... So much in love. So excited. What's the matter? Did someone hurt you? You can tell me everything. You can trust me. Were you raped? Don't tell me you couldn't afford to eat- l don't know- peanuts at your friend's bar. l did. But there comes a time when you want to have 1 O euros to eat decently. I'm not crazy. What's your old man's name? Joe. Did Joe give you pleasure? Did he excite you? No, never. Are you nuts? You never feIt any pleasure? Or excitement.. . from the situation, just from the transgression? Never. Poor little woman. Do you mind being with a whore? You're not a whore. Doesn't it bother you? Doesn't it disgust you? No. Maybe because I'm not jealous. Or you have no morals. - Or it excites me. - What a bastard! You're in for it this time. It's time to pay? Yes, it is. This is 20 euros. We said 200. It's 200 minus a zero. You're kidding. Sorry, but it's all l got. You all right? What happened? What a swine. Son of a bitch! But it's your fauIt too. Get paid first. Don't lift a finger until they fork out. l never had problems with anyone else. Poor darling. Alone and confused. l sold my ass for 20 euros tonight. That's six beers! It makes me sick. What did you do for 20 euros? I'm not telling you. It's too sick. l want you to keep me posted now: where you are and when. l can take it because l know you have your reasons. But do nothing without telling me, okay? Call it a pact. Okay. You're my pimp, kind of. Pay first. Sure. Enough. You've got it down. Can you hear the beauty? You're the beauty. Come on. Shit! What's wrong? Gotta cancel. l got my period. Don't you have enough to pay bills? We could have gone out to dinner. What? Come here. l have to run. That a new jacket? Yep. See you tonight. No, l don't do that. I'll give you an extra 50 euros. No. You should have said so. Are you nuts? The chicken... Thank you. And the lamb. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. He sees me doing a PhD. Can you believe it? No. Dummy. Sorry. l have to take it. My client tonight. Yes? Laura? Yes? l'd rather meet at the station at about 1 O:30 p.m., okay? At the station? l don't know. Don't worry. I'll have my car. Then we'll go somewhere else. No, something's come up. l can't make it. Okay? Fine. l cancelled. Let it ring. He'll harass me. l want him off my case. Laura, why did you hang up? We can get together another time. We'll work it out. No, don't call back. l won't be available. What are you doing to him? Nothing. Nothing special. Hello? Who are you? - Put Laura on. - l won't put her on. She's with me now. Don't ever call again! Son of a bitch! Let me calm down. We can't keep this up. You've had enough. Naturally, it affects you. It's my problem. You shouldn't be mixed up in this. We went completely overboard. Sorry, it's my fauIt. l shouldn't have. Forgive me. I'm sorry. It's okay. We drank too much. l have too many revoIting images in my head. When we go out, there's always a moment when l wonder what you had to do so we could order this. It's as if each dish was worth part of your body. l can't quit my job. I'm almost retirement age. And I'm president of the local S?gol?ne Royal election committee. It's important to me. l support her ideas, but l admire her as a woman, her brains, her mind-set. She'll achieve her goal. If l can contribute... Why do you do this? What? What attracts you to young women? Who wouldn't be attracted? But why do you have to pay? It's the times, the society we live in. It's all for sale. Organs, sperm, children, everything. So... l pay for my fantasies. It's not immoral, as long as the girl consents. l didn't consent last time. Hey, look... That was a misunderstanding. It was for you. You didn't understand that. Forget about it. l see it as an exchange of favors. There's something in it for both, the buyers and the bought. It's free trade, in a way. ln our case, we're consenting aduIts, right? l wouldn't go for underage Thai girls. l have ethics. l don't hang around school playgrounds. l have money. l use it. You use your ass. The score's even. It's 4:00 p.m. ls that Joe? You followed me? l can't believe you did that. I'm your guy, right? l have a right to pick you up after work. Cut it out. You're wearing lipstick. Stay out of this part of my life. It's not me. I'm with you. The girl who left the hotel is not me. You have nothing to do with her. Sure it's you. I'm no fool. It's you all over. Don't touch me! You reek of that geezer's cheap scent and mildewed cum. You're still seeing that pig. l thought you wouldn't... That he made you sick, scared you. Waiting till he clubs you in the face? He didn't touch me today. He just talked. Nothing better to do than listen to some clown's sob stories? For 200 euros? I'll stop seeing him if you want. It's for you to decide, you idiot! You're just a kid who sucks cock to buy Diesel jeans. What did you say? l bought jeans once. The rest goes to pay bills. You know that. What's got into you? Go get fucked! Wait. Come here. I'll take care of you. Don't be jealous. l love you. Don't be jealous. Stop it. Stop. You're schizzed out, Laura. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Look, it's no good. l spy on you. I'm jealous. I'll drive you nuts. l won't be that way. We have to stop. It's over. l can't do it, in fact. I'm not up to it. You can't do that! You can't leave me! Not after helping yourseIf. That's enough. - Don't treat me that way. - Cut it out! Free room and board... You're 30 and do nothing all day. No degree. You don't know hard times. Don't judge me! What are you talking about? Expect me to work at MacDonald's 20 hours a week for peanuts and flunk out? You never even went to school! You never open a book! You don't work! Not even to help me out so l can quit! Help me, and I'll stop! What do others do? You're not the only student on Earth! How do others manage? Do they all have to suck cock? You and your studies! How will you look when the truth gets out? How will l look? l thought you were special. You're just a spoiled papa's boy. And you're a whore! It kept you horny for a while! What do you want? My photos. All the pictures you took of me. l want them back! What are you talking about? This is the digital age. Think l pasted them in an album? Don't jerk me around. Erase them from your computer. Why would l do that? Because I'm asking you to. Cut it out. Think your goody-two-shoes look sells? Your pictures are worthless. They're crap. Look! That's an ass. That gives guys a boner. Not your flat ass and fish face. I'll pay you back. l swear. I'll pay it all back. Erase the photos. That's all l ask. I'm begging you. Yeah, right. Show me how you beg. Beg some more. You might coax me with your hot little tits. You like that. Think you can touch me, asshole! What do you take me for? What you are... a whore. What? What did you say? A whore who can't do much but comes cheap, l hear. Yeah, it's a small world. Word gets around. You're a whore, period. So lay off about your crummy pictures. Now beat it! I'm so glad to hear your voice. l've missed you. Really. You vanish into thin air. All those emails, and no answer. l was afraid. Afraid of what? That something happened. That you ran into trouble. l had trouble with a photographer, a guy who did some erotic photos. l wanted him to give them back. He said the whole town knew l was a whore. - He called you a whore? - Yes. What a jerk. Anyway, I'm quitting. I'm leaving. l can't stay. I'm going to Paris. Where in Paris? l don't know yet. l have to work it out. No more meetings? No, it's over. I'm changing my life. l understand. l worry about you. You'll need money. The cost of living is much higher. l know. Look, I'll offer you 1,OOO euros. 1,OOO euros for five hours with me, if that could help with the material side. One last rendezvous. We'll end on a high note. No. Even for 1,OOO euros? 1,OOO euros, Laura... So.. .yes? "Today we'll stay and talk for a haIf hour." "Then we'll go to a place near the hotel. "It's a club l know. We'll have fun and some pleasure." Come sit on the bed. It's a nice place. It gets me hot. Right nearby. l'd rather not. l don't want to be seen. l'd rather stay here. You know, I'm very shy and discreet too. It's a place for regulars. It's very dark. No one will see us. Trust me. We can watch videos. It's exciting. l've taken women there. There's never been a problem. l went to a sex shop once, with my first boyfriend. For laughs. It's for fun. It's a change. Did you bring the things l asked? Good. That negligee is very pretty. Here, put this on. l can't go out like this. With what I'm paying? l leave my stuff here? Sure. We have five hours. - Hello. - Hello. - How is it going? - Fine, and you? Fine, thanks. Thank you. Enjoy your afternoon. Sit down. We'll watch a bit of the film. You can let him near you. l told him about you. He's harmless. l know him. Same with him. He's on the level. Come on. Enough images for today. Take that off. No! For 1,OOO euros, you can! Where are we going? Come and you'll see. If it makes you nervous, we'll go back to the hotel. What are you doing? Keep going. You'll see. Calm down, Laura. For that price, what did you expect? Give me my money now. Go get dressed. I'll leave the envelope on the bed. See you Thursday? See you Thursday, right? Yes, Thursday. Hello. Leave a message. As you see, there's only 100 euros, instead of the 1,000 euros agreed. The rest Thursday at 2:00 p.m. l wanted to be sure l saw you before you left. Trust me, you'll get your money. Have a good evening. So that's okay with you? Of course. I'll Xerox everything and send it weekly. - Everything? - Absolutely. But what about the sections? You'll need an excuse, or you can't take tests. It happened to my cousin. You need a doctor's certificate. l know. If it's more, I'll send more. Don't worry. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. l delayed my departure, and you stood me up. Now l've got to take the train, but listen up. Call me by tonight and send my money, or I'll call your wife, your boss, and tell them all about you. Hear me? If l don't have word by 7:00 p.m., I'll call. Don't worry; l've got the numbers! Asshole! Laura? Shit, Joe, send that money right away. l know. Let me explain. Explain what? You just took me for a fool. l want my money. I'm not at home. l had a heart attack. I'm convalescing in the south. My wife blocked my accounts. No wires. She must suspect something. No email either. l don't believe you. It won't work. l want my money! I'm telling the truth. I'm very ill. l have cancer. l won't live long. What about a check? Send me a check. Too risky. l can't leave a trace. See, you're bullshitting me. Quit taking me for a jerk! You just mentioned wiring money. Because of you, l couldn't buy my ticket. l have to hide in fiIthy toilets. Look, l get out of here tomorrow. We have to meet so l can pay you. You'll get it. l promise. l really want to see you again. We'll meet, okay? You should have said it was an all-nighter. l worried. My battery was dead. Let me take a shower? You didn't shower there? No, that hotel has no water pressure. How sleazy! What are you doing? - Counting... - The rent. I'll give it to them. Good-bye. We need someone full-time. That won't work. We're not offering a student job. Thank you. Good luck. Good luck. Bye. Thank you. Hello? I'm calling from a friend's phone. You're not dead yet? "Just one last time. And I'll pay your train ticket." "4,OOO, Laura, think it over." Leave me alone! Can you smell it? Lighter than the last. Sure it is. A bit lighter. You can smell it. Anyway, Loire Valley wines go with the lighter wines. Here's Philippe, my wine steward. Laura, my friend Laura. That's my daughter's name. Pleased to meet you. Know how l met her? In the street. Sitting on a bench. With cheese? And red meat? Cheese, game grilled meat with red wine. Even a light one. She was looking for a job, and I hired her. lsn't life wonderful? So everything okay? I'm tasting your wine. The new one. But... I'm still in the dark. It's not as good as school. Feel ready for your exams? He wants the critical analysis based on the Judeo-Spanish lectures. - Shit. - Laura? I'm so behind. I'm beat. I can't do it. God damn it! Let's eat! Stop, you can't quit now. Of course you're struggling. Look, I'll call you back. Once I finish setting up. Come eat, Laura. l don't have time. Forget school. It's useless. Just look at us! "End of second quarter" "Exam resuIts: Applied Languages, first year Spanish" It's coming. Elsa, hurry up. She doesn't speak Italian. l don't believe it! l passed! An A in Spanish... What an ace! A-minus in composition. Only a B in English, but that's okay. That would have suited me! Leave a message and I'll call back. Joe, it's Laura. l took my exams. And l passed, with an A average. l just wanted you to know. So what did they say? They happy? Yes, very. Anyway, you seem to like it. You like it? Very much. l like the feel of it. No job contract to pad out your file? Any extra hours besides your waitress job? No. You students are something. Meaning? Great expectations but slim means. This terrace is nice. If l rent to you, we'll drink champagne on the terrace. Today would you say categorically that you had no choice? Yes. You don't say in your book whether since you came to Paris, you've again turned to prostitution or if you've managed to make ends meet without it? We'll respect your silence, Lola. And thank you for coming to talk about it here, tonight, on this program. You're welcome. Let me remind you: a large number of students turn to prostitution to pursue their studies. It is thus not an exceptional phenomenon. Figures revealed by the student movement in the spring of 2006 were intended to draw the government's attention to the students' plight. According to one organization, over 45,000 students live in extreme poverty, and 225,000 struggle to pay for their studies.
