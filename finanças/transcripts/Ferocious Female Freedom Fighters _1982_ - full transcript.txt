[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Good afternoon sports fans, and welcome to the Troma's Woman's International Invitational Wrestling Championships. Coming into the arena now is Edna Santosa, the crowd loves her. [FART NOISE] She's one of their favorites, and she is the defending champion. Now let's step into the corner of her opponent Bambi Bersuki. What's that smell? Forget it, wrestle. BAMBI: (THINKING) I need a change. Who am I? Am I really happy wrestling? If only I could sing like Banana Rama, or direct like Lina Verspule. Gee, I hope one of those girls gets undressed. Wouldn't it be great? -Hello. -How you doing? -Hi. -What's going on, how are you. Hey, let's check out the the menu. [SHOUTING] Chick in the centerfold. Uh oh, I think that guy recognizes me. [INAUDIBLE] table three. [INAUDIBLE] Oh, look at those girls. I hope one of those robes falls open just a little bit! Oh, oh, the woman in the [INAUDIBLE] red. Remember, today's broadcast is brought to you by Marco's Footwear. If it doesn't say [INAUDIBLE], it's not a Marco's shoe. MOTHER: Nana, don't let him watch that. You know it will only excite him. But it's his sister. Ma, come on, just five minutes more. MOTHER: Five minutes more and your head will explode. Uh, I better applaud real cool so she'll notice me. Heh heh heh. Oh, he's handsome. I better speckle on more makeup. [GRUNTING] [FART] Oh, hot babes on canvas! Oh, skin, naked skin! I'm getting excited! I can't take it anymore! I'm getting too excited! [GROANING] Oh, can't take it anymore! [SCREAM] Mrs. Bazooki, your kid's too much fucked up! [SQUISHING SOUNDS] -Stand back! Oh, I told you this was going to happen. Oh, I can feel the semen rushing to his brain. Quick, go under the sink and get a 10 gallon scumbag. [WHIMPER] [GRUNTING] [INAUDIBLE] Smell this! ANNOUNCER: Bazooki has done the impossible, not only beating Santoza, but getting both refs to quit as well! -I quit! -Uncle! Hey, number nine with a salad bar looks great. -OK! -Hey, Debbie! Hey, champ! Come on over to my place, baby! I've got a vibrator! And it's this big! Thanks! I got my own, and it's got an all-wood base! [MUMBLING] Oh, oh, hey, baby! Hi, let me introduce myself. I'm Nathan of Nathan's House of Trophies. Here's my card. You know, with a body like yours-- [HUMMING] NATHAN: --you'd make big bucks as a trophy model. Really, really-- there's big, big money in it. Say, did you ever hear the fable about the lion and the TV repairman? OK, bad example. Listen, how about the one where this Greek sailor meets the gay Pentecostal? Is it-- MIA: Hi, Bambi! Oh, I see you've met Nathan the bullshit artist. Hey! Is he handing you that line about trophy modeling? Forget it. -[BURP] I once spent three days naked on a fire hydrant for this prick and he didn't even spring for lunch. Let's split. [GRUMBLING] Fucking Mia is a but-insky. Think of your futures! I got my hair styled and my best gray leisure suit pressed for nothing. Dam! Sure, Nathan's an asshole, but he's right. You think so? Wrestling's just not as creatively satisfying anymore. Just once, I'd like to express myself without beating the shit out of perfect strangers. My whole family wrestles-- my mother, her mother. When I was born, I wasn't slapped. I was body slammed. Watch it, stupid! Hey, you broads want to come over to my place and do some trophy modeling? MIA: Oh, beat it, schmucko! Ah, how about rolling around in some rice, then? Oh, come on! You love to roll around in rice! But I know these guys. They won't cook it first. -Hey, baby. BAMBI: Oh, what the heck. Let's party. [INTERPOSING VOICES] BAMBI: Oh, come on, Mia. Don't be a tease. Pull over. This is better than cruising the valley. I love it! Come on! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Let's party. BIKER: Get her off, get her off. [INTERPOSING VOICES] BAMBI: Oh, there's so many flavors to choose from! BIKER: [INAUDIBLE] BAMBI: Wow, look, a lava lamp! Oh, wow! Oh, baby, you want my lava lamp? Oh, how about a kick? [INTERPOSING VOICES] Oh, look at my new Adidas! This looks like a job for [INAUDIBLE], the man who talks like Elvis. Wish I had a big belly. [INTERPOSING VOICES] (HARMONIZING): Hello! (HARMONIZING): Hello! Hello! [ELVIS-LIKE GIBBERISH] Over here, come on! Ha! Hey, get out of here. [INAUDIBLE] Wow, this guy fights like Elvis. [HUMMING] Will you stop that humming? We're here to [INAUDIBLE] chicks! Mind if I finish the song? [HUMMING] Christ. I used to go steady with Chuck Norris too! [HUMMING] Oh boy! [INAUDIBLE] Hey, you look familiar! Weren't you in the pit at the Sex Pistols concert at the Fillmore? -[HUMMING] Shut up, God damn it! I can't hear the heads crack! [HUMMING] [SQUEAL] BAMBI: Bye, call me, OK! You've got my number, right? Let's do [INAUDIBLE] Wow, you're an unbelievable fighter. Well, thank you very much. I haven't seen action like that since John Davidson's Christmas special. Yeah, I saw that, uh-- Do you always talk like Elvis? Yeah. You know, as a rule, you should never refreeze sea bass. Yeah. [HUMMING] Hey, milky face! Any bones hanging? Ah, talk to you later. The boss wants me to piss on this van over here. Enjoy. Y'all want to hear some Hawaiian nose humming? No, there's a-- the big fish came in, but there's a guy-- you can't refreeze seaweed, duh, ther'es-- That's sea bass. That's Bambi's line. Well, the, uh-- Did you forget your fucking lines again? Uh, yeah. Let's go. Uh huh, yeah. Mom, I have to speak to you. It's important. Yvette! This is the last place I expected to see you. What do you want? It's about my career. I'm not happy. I want to spread my wings. I want to be all I can be. I want to blossom! I want to sore! I want to be part of the Pepsi generation! I know my mother and my mother's mother and my mother's mother's mother before were all wrestlers. And your mother's mother's mother's mother, mother fucker. Mom, wait a minute! The point is, it just isn't working anymore. The point is, your brother is lying in that hospital bed with a terrible case of dicosis and all you can think about is yourself. That's not true! So how is the little pervert? You know how yes he is. He's very sick. He needs a veinectomy and he needs it fast. Otherwise, we'll be scraping chunks of him off the ceiling. And you'll be cleaning it up! Well, put a paper bag over his head and tape his eyes closed. Have you ever heard that voice inside of you that says there's more in life than slamming another woman to the mat with incredible force? There's beauty out there! There's freedom! There's Lowenbrau! I'll give you beauty! I'll give you freedom! I have half a mind to put a half-nelson on you and slam you through these tile floors myself. You don't have to get physical, mom. Look, you're a nice old lady and I'd really hate to have to kick your ass, but I'm a modern woman now. Things have changed since you were young. [WHISTLE] MAN: Yo! OK, I'm coming. Asshole! May I go in now? Yes, but remember, no cleavage. [HEAVY BREATHING] Nice tits! Don't change the subject, Dr. Mengele. What's going on with my brother? What's that thing in his nose? All right, I won't beat around the bush. Uh, your brother's got acute dicosis. The vane that should be going to the tip of his dick is going to the top of his head. And if he gets too excited-- [HYPERVENTILATING] --kaboom! A regular Mount St. Helen's! But the corrective sugary is very expensive, kid. [COUGHING] But I don't have any money for an operation. Oh yeah. Oh, that's-- that's tough rugella. Maybe you could blow me. I'll think about it, Dr. Mengele. Ah, well, excuse me. I have an addition for [INAUDIBLE] two. My poor little brother. You don't know how badly I want to give you a big, wet, sloppy French kiss, but I'm afraid it would arouse you and your head would explode. Look at that wet spot on the pillow. Oh, you poor little pervert. [SLOSHING SOUND] SECURITY SYSTEM: Lock car. Lock car. Put key in pocket, douche bag. Request time! Want to hear &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;? Give me a fucking break. [HUMMING &quot;HAVA NAGILA&quot;] Oy vey, [INAUDIBLE] This fucking humming's got me [NON-ENGLISH] Hey, Bambi! Have you given any more thought to doing a little modeling for trophy work? -Get lost, jerk off. -Huh? Go away. Oh, wait a minute. How about, uh this? There's a-- there's an opening as a stress tester in a dildo factory right down the street. Let go, sleazeball. BIKER: -Hey, Bambi! Bambi, come on over here! [BURP] So now you know my problems. What do you think I should do? The first thing you should do is tell that guy in the leisure suit to take his dildo job and shove it. If I were you and I needed to make money, I'd consider a high class job like what I do. You dress up. -Mmm? There's never a dull moment, the pay's pretty good, and it's better than being corn-holed by old doctors. That's blow jobs. Anyway, why not just give it a try? [GRUNTING] [INAUDIBLE] ANNOUNCER: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen and masked persons of all ages to the 10th consecutive day of Wrestleholics Anonymous Wrestlefest! Have a seat! You anorexic bitch! Hello, my name is John X, and I have a wrestling problem. What's your name? [GLASS SHATTERING] So then, the gay Apentacostal says to the Greek sailor, surf's up in my asshole! -Mmm. -You like that one? Yeah. Listen, I have a book full of them with illustration-- Oh? --back at my place. Mm-hm. CAMERA MAN: Could we lose the bald man camera right, please? Could you please sit down? You're blocking the shot. Oh-- the bald headed man in front of-- [RIPPING SOUND] CAMERA MAN: Get-- sit down, sir. That's it. No, sir, out of the shot, please. You're-- sir, would yo please get out of-- that's it, sir. Oh, no. Oh, damn it. There's something about the sight of hot babes with underarm hair. I know what you mean. I have a veritable forest. Mmm, mmm. Here's one you haven't heard. What's brown and has got holes? Mmm? Swiss shit. Hm. Ew. [INAUDIBLE] Here's my picture with Gary Hart. Oh, [INAUDIBLE] I didn't know you could fit that many people into a sink. Where is she? Where's Devorah? Will you be brutally honest with me? Mm-hm. Do you think that joke would have been funnier if I wore a blue mask with little wings? Mm-hm. Are you sure you can design the office the way Devorah wants it? Of course I can. You know, wrestling skills aren't necessarily transferable to interior design. Most people think of wrestling as a circus from hell performed performed by partially conscious sub humans. But what the hell, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for giving me the chance! [SLOSHING] I've got a really great sense of-- Sammy. [SLOSHING] Ah, take this box. It's tea from Devorah Thank you, suit woman. Take this money. It's Confederate, so watch where you spend it. -OK. -Devorah says, drink the tea. It'll help with the office design. Think like her, drink like her. Can I fold the money? -Yes, you can. -Good. Otherwise, it won't fit into my purse next to the baked potato. Good thing I wasn't in the mood for anchovy pizza. Don't you hate it when you get hot mozzarella on your compact and cigarettes? [SLOSHING] Mm-hm. Gee, this looks just like monkey face in drag. Hope she doesn't recognize me. At least she doesn't hum. You're going to drink that shit? What did I do, raise a moron? You know what Devorah put in there? Monkey urine, and North American moose phlegm! Yuck. You want some motherly advice? Forget that stuff. Suit up and get back in the ring. I'd rather drink this shit any day than wrestle. As a matter of fact, I'm going to have a second cup of this shit. Hm, she never wants a second cup of my shit. [FART] Gee, that noise smells funny. I wonder where that came from. I wonder what-- hey, it's that rickshaw driver over there. Hey, Franco-America! What did you have for lunch? [INAUDIBLE] and a half slab? [INAUDIBLE] uh oh, he's coming over here. I better get out of here now. I'm going to split. There's my honey. [MUSICAL HORN] Classy horny, buddy. Hey, uh, marry me, baby! Come on, marry me! I-- I'm telling you, if you marry me, I-- I could solve all your problems right now, Bambi. Come and live with me at the gym. Get serious, clown. You think you could just pull alongside a girl and she's yours? By the way, certain kinds of deciduous plants can be effective anti inflammatories. [SLIDE WHISTLE] -Hm. BAMBI: How do you like what I've done to your office? Bambi, I think that you and I should have a little talk. Honestly, I have some misgivings. Take that tree, for example. It doesn't go there. Well, where do you think it should go, Ms. Devorah? Well, I don't know, but it certainly doesn't go there. Maybe we should get an objective opinion. Jane, where do you think it should go? Up her ass, Ms. Devorah! [GASP] I don't mean to nitpick a contract, but this says you're supposed to be an interior decorator, not an interior decorator. You've got my office looking like the business end of a toilet. And I mean that in the nicest possible way. It's just bad design. Don't beat around the bush! I can take it! Tell me what you really think. OK, take that door, for example. Cheap, hollow core. JANE: Occupado! [FLUSH] I'm in here! Now, let's talk about my office. You call a cheap plastic rose and a cheap plastic vase and an old framed picture of me good design? Why the file color and the wall color don't even match. It's not what I paid for. [SIGH] Sifi, get me another special, and make it a double. Can I ask you a question? Where did you get your degree? The Ray Charles School of Design? I've seen Cuban prisons with more decorum! I'm supposed to listen to a woman who drinks moose phlegm about taste! [GASP] [SCREAM] Property of Motel 6? Souvenir of a one night stand? [GASP] You [INAUDIBLE] Yankee bitch! Oh, you have no sense of pride! Uh! The only thing that goes with this rug is your butt and nothing goes with the book case, not even your shoes! I'm calling Goodwill. BAMBI: Dial nine first, bitch! All my work is museum quality, you pig! [SCREAM] GOODWILL GUY: Somebody call Goodwill? Yeah, here's your donation. Where? Oh! Ah! Nice desk! Hey you can't hit my boss? Oh yeah? Watch this, [INAUDIBLE]. I wanted wall paper! [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Oh. -[INAUDIBLE] have a seat! Hey, bitch. I'm-- I'm beginning to get the idea that you're not happy with my work. How about a second opinion? I will not ask for my deposit back, but as a personal favor to me, I would like you to redo the entire room again. And this time, avoid earth tones! Oh, Bambi, you're home. I had a really neat day. And yours? How did things go with your new job? Ah! I had a step back on the Devorah project. Do you want to hear a little more about it? Well, she took me like this. Let me tell you how it went. We had design problem and then [INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE] fake colors! [CHOKING] OK! You don't have to be so graphic. [CHOKING] I think-- I think I understand what you mean. [CHOKING] Big deal. So you had a little problem with her. [CHOKING] Sorry I asked. I guess I don't hear [INAUDIBLE]. I hate that! Never interrupt me what I'm telling a story! I hate it-- [FART] I hate it! [FART] They didn't like the design idea? Like it? They didn't-- [FART] - --like matzo ball soup! [FART] Gee, I hate to change the subject, but I think you just knocked off one of my earrings and now you're standing on it. It was very expensive. It was a gift from my grandmother. Could you please move it, huh? [GROANING] Stop pulling on my leg. MIA: Oh, could you pick up those dogs? Move! Look, if you don't stop it, I'm going to do a Vulcan mind meld. So we don't agree on interior design. I say let bygones be bygones I'd like you to meet my on the staff design consultant. You could use a little overwhelming at this point in the film. Check him out. One, two, three-- oh shit, what comes after three? [BOING] Mmm. [BOING] Well, three, three-- Tell me after you've seen him naked. We can compare notes. BARNEY: E is for Elvis, K is for King. G is for Graceland, S is for sing. D is for Doctor, K is for Kernal. U-- hey, baby. It's a small world, isn't it? Stop fighting it, mama. Come on, go out with me. You know you will before this movie's over. Whoo, I got to work off those 37 Monte Christo sandwiches with cream gravy I had for lunch. D is for Doctor, N is for-- I'd rather wrestle than go out with him. Ho, ho, ho, come on. Oh, oh! Ha. There you go, baby. Having a good time? Can I get you a soda or assorted nuts or deli sandwich? Turkey leg? A spit burger? Anything, baby. Some day. I'd rather be wrestling. How about a kick in the spine? [GONG] Oh, come on, baby. Let's dance. -Oh! -Come on. Huh! Huh! Come on, baby! [GRUNTING] Come on, baby! Oh! Get the king! [GRUNTING] Oh yeah. Multiplication dance-- everybody join in! [GRUNTING] Nothing like good [INAUDIBLE] gin and good gash, uh huh. Yeah, yeah. You got him, Bambi! That's the position! Eat her! -Huh? -God damn it, Bambi! [TRAIN WHISTLE] You get a woman with legs like those, you don't do nothing? Eat her! -Hm. I said eat her! Mmm. Now, go on! [GROANING] That's it, Bambi Make a move! Come on, girl! Jeez, uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Get her, Bambi! Now we're getting some place baby! All right. Let me get a Polaroid. [GRUNTING] Why did he speed up the music like that? Does he always do that? Yeah, he always does that on a first date. It's his idea of a good time. BARNEY: Hey, monkey-face! Where's my camera? Count your lucky stars. He used to make all his girlfriends wear cotton [INAUDIBLE] and do the bunny hop. OK, let's start from the top. [CASH MACHINE SOUNDS] And there's one of me and Gary Hart. That's nothing. Here's one of me, Gary Hart, and Liberachi at Rock Hudson's house. Hey, look. Lo-- ah, fuck you. You ain't even paying attention. [SQUASH] [SQUASH] [SQUASH] ANNOUNCER: Tonight, our match is a no holds barred quadruple elimination grudge match competition and mixed grill. Also, will the owner of a 1972 White Matador with a shit-brown roof and green interior, please move your car. It's not blocking anyone, but it is so fucking ugly, you're driving down property values. SPECTATOR: That my car! [INAUDIBLE] my car! That my car! That my car! I smell tuna melt! Ah! Tuna melt! Tuna melt? [INTERPOSING VOICES] (CHANTING): Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna-- Gee, Bambi. You're not your same old self. Could it be that everything is not working perfectly in your existence? It began as a date with Barney and before I knew it, I was back on the mat. All I wanted was a new career and to be the best me I could possibly. And instead, my whole life's going down the toilet! [WAILING] Here, Bambi. Take this. It's an empty envelope. I'm depressed and you give me an empty envelope? What the hell's the matter with you? When I was a little girl, my mother used to tell us, if you had a problem, put it in an envelope and mail it to an angel. An envelope? Mail this envelope to an angel? I'm worried about you, Mia. You're worse off than I am. Is it wrong, Bambi? Is it so wrong for a modern girl to hold on to their dreams, even if they are pointless, meaningless, and stupid? Man, get serious. My career's in overdrive in reverse, my little brother needs an operation or his head is going to explode, and I got Bippo the Clown as a roommate. On the other hand, my father used to say, if things couldn't possibly get worse, get a couple of big ugly guys, have them, come over, and beat you up so you really have something to cry about. [KNOCKING] BIG UGLY GUY: Ah, we're the big ugly guys. Someone call? -You're early. I thought so. I'm gonna go out for a danish. MIA: Sorry, Bambi. I thought I told them before that they're on after the salesmen, but you know how big ugly guys are. They just can't wait. [HUMMING] BIG UGLY GUY: Have you ever considered sales as a career option? Hm? Hi, how are you? Here, take this original rope necklace, for instance. -Well, uh-- -Want to be my sales rep? -Uh-- -Make lots of money? Uh-- Looks even better with a strapless. Huh-- Go on, try it. See for yourself. -Hm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, don't think so. But are you open for suggestions? [GRUNTING] What do you think of my designer [INAUDIBLE]? I don't [INAUDIBLE] to know [INAUDIBLE]. [GRUNTING] Someone call for the ugly guys? Yes, and you're late. [INTERPOSING VOICES] What's the matter with you? Oh, and you can't make sell it as an ankle bracelet, either? Oh! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Let's get her in the boat. -Can't let her cast off! -Hey! Hey! Bambi, I just want to talk to you about a future in sales. Huh? -Rope bracelet jewelry. -[INAUDIBLE] You're going to have to learn the ropes, kid. You know, you got to change your makeup. Huh? What's with this mustard [INAUDIBLE]? --[INAUDIBLE] mess with the US mail. Huh! Huh! Look out! Take that! Hey, do me a favor. Smell my foot, tell me if it's a rash. Oh, Barney! BARNEY: Now, if you fellas are done with your presentation, kindly pack your shit and get the hell out of here. Come on! Ya! Listen, monkey-face. [GROANING] No woman of mine is going to work for a living. Most people would die to kiss the feet of the king. Now, smell them! Tell me what you think. Smell them! Very nice! Very nice! [APPLAUSE] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the ugly guys! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. ANNOUNCER: Put your hands together for the ugly guys. UGLY GUY: Show me love. We'll be here all week! Thank you, Boston! Rock and roll! Hey, mama Mia! Where have you been? Sorry I missed all the fun. You have a good night, OK? (STRAINED): Uh! Good seeing you too! Can you believe it? The 711 was out of milk. Mm-mm. BARNEY: Hey, ladies. There are no carbon based life forms in this sector. Thank you very much. I knew he was my kind of guy. [BOINGING] BARNEY: Ah, OK. I got the diaphragm out. Everything's fine now. You have no yeast infection either, baby. Come on, you got to get in there. You got to win this one. I'm going to get big money on you, baby. You can do it. You can do it. Come on, honey. Hey, uh, buddy. You happen to know any jokes that, uh, I could tell in mixed company? What's brown and got holes? Hm. Uh-uh. Uh, no, no. Not even funny. Dude, I'm so fucking stoned. Huh-huh. U-gan-da! -U-gone-da! -U-gan-da! ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third annual Wrestle [INAUDIBLE] Geographical Nomenclature Wrestle Contest Festival Wrestle-Off. Back in there, Bambi, and come on. Come on, do it for the king. Come on. Get in there. Rip their God damn hearts out. Kick some ass. Come on, baby. Yeah. WRESTLER: U-gan-da! U-gone-da! BARNEY: [INAUDIBLE] WRESTLER: U-gan-da! Pardon me, are you Madonna? I didn't think so. What a coincidence! I didn't think so either! Oh, damn. Oh, yoo-hoo! Huh? You know, I've been thinking. Maybe I am Madonna. Hm. Well, you look like Madonna, but, uh, where's that ugly black mole on your lip? I had it removed and reapplied to my cervix. Want to see? -Oh, oh, oh, hm. Enough bullshit. Who the hell are you, anyway? Hm? I guess is either Zorro or somebody's pet raccoon. Let's say you and I 86 these goofy looking masks. All right. Wow, jeez, put it back on! Oy, what a [INAUDIBLE]! Hm, thank God I saw action in Iwo Jima. Say, what were you born in high school? Most likely to be queen of the jack-o-lanterns? [WHIMPER] I was Little Miss Pumpkin Patch four years in a row, thank you very much. Mm. After I left, they retired the crown. Hm. They bronzed my seeds in appreciation. Hm. [SHUDDER] -U-gan-da! -U-done-da! U-gan-da! -U-gan-da! -U-done-da! U-gan-da! BAMBI: U-gone-da! WRESTLER: U-gan-da! Hey, let's call the whole thing off! I said U-gan-da and that's final! Do me a favor, would you? Take this envelope down to the post office and mail it to an angel, OK? Hm, hm. OK, boss. Mm-hm? By the way, smart money's on U-gan-da. Mm-hm. Caribbean! Caribbean! Caribbean! Caribbean! Caribbean! Oh yeah, man. Women in [INAUDIBLE] spandex! Hi, I'm collecting business cards for the fish bowl raffle. [GROAN] Bitchin'! How about you, sir? Count me in. Ah! OK, Caribbean! Caribbean! I give! -That's it! Get on with it. Good morning! Morning! Well, actually, it's not really a good morning. It's more like a pretty fair kind of morning. Actually, if you think about it, it's not fair. The sky's full of clouds and everything. Mm-hm. Well, I-- look, I don't mean it that way. I'm trying to tell you something here. I wanted-- -Get to the point. Oh, OK, OK. I-- I got a problem here. Uh, it's a mail problem. Well, I-- it's not my prostate or anything like that. It's-- it's-- I actually-- Jesus Christ, what kind of [INAUDIBLE] is that? Boy am I glad I'm not in this scene. NATHAN: Well, I know it's not mine because my name isn't Bazooki. Um, actually, it's, uh-- it's Nathan. Anyway, I've been looking for a place to stay around here, and I understand that your son's going to be dying pretty soon, so-- One more scene like this-- [RICOCHET] --I'm moving to Samoa! When he dies, call me. Mm-hm. [SLOSHING] OK, Andre, open wide. Time for a double dose of mom's homemade saliva. Andre? Andre? Hey, schmuck! Hey, sis! What you got in the bag? Is that for me? Yes, it's an extra special surprise just for you. Oh boy, what is it? Something special. Wow! Oh, I hope it's that deluxe model sex doll I've been wishing for! You know, the one I saw in the magazine! Oh, I'd be so excited-- the one with the simulated, battery-powered vagina that has real hair! You mean, like mother's? ANDRE: So exciting! Oh, a cheap plastic sports car? You've gotta be kidding. Can I still take it to my room and fuck it? Andre, you're even more disgusting than I thought! Oh, ma. It's not like I was jerking off again! Ignore the old bag, Andre. She's never enjoyed having sex with plastic, or iron, or lumber, or pop bottles, or dad, or uncle Banya, or aunt Martha, or me, or Fluffy, or Spot, or farm equipment, or plastic fruit, or chickens, or-- Bambi, where have you been? Tell me! Mom, take this money. Here, I want you to have it. This is it? This is all you've been able to scrape together? Operations don't grow on trees, you know. Mom! Operations, smoperations! Get the kid a 10 year old hooker! [GASP] Well! Well! That's all I get is a well? I insult her baby and all I get is a well. I hope she falls down a well. Three, three-- [GRUNTING] Three-- [GRUNTING] Three. [GRUNTING] Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentleman. Thank you very much. Say, uh, can I jump in there before you start another set of three? Hey, go away. Why don't you leave alone? What, well, what, well, wait, wait a minute. Look, look. I'm-- I'm here to tell you that getting the babe isn't a hard thing. It's keeping her. Huh? Look, those muscles are-- are good for bagging the babe, but you need something more than muscles to make romance. And you're probably wondering how I keep all the babes. Well, the suit and the shades aren't the whole story. You know, I like you and I've-- I've got one word for you-- videotape. BARNEY: That's two words. Well, my friend, I hold in my hand the key to success with all women. It's the book that tells you not only how to, but where to, when to, why to, and what to do to keep your romance alive. And it's from Troma, so you know it's got to be good. That's right, Troma-- the people who brought you &quot;Surf Nazis Must Die&quot;. [MUMBLING] And because you're special, I'm going to make it available to you at a very low price. Just give me a few bucks, just a couple. Put it right there. Mm-hm? -Eh-- Mmm, mmm, mmm, No, that was not what I meant. What's your least favorite music to run to? I'd have to say flute music, I guess. I hate that electric crap too. Yeah, especially medieval choral techno pop shitty flute music that sounds like it's from another movie. -Hey, girl. Hey, girls. Can I ask you a question. What's brown and got holes? Get lost, pal. We already heard that one. By the way, where are we going? Some kind of therapy. Barney set it up. What kind of therapy? Ha! Breaking [INAUDIBLE]. You were on 9:15 and 9:30, respectively. [GRUNTING] Oo, it's an out of body treatment-- good for your skin, good for your hair. You look good on the outside, you'll look good on the inside. Let's not miss any spots! The hippopotamus mating ritual has its own strange and peculiar creatures. Only the females participate. Heh heh heh. The strange and somehow beautiful ritual that happens only once a year in secluded part of the jungle-- a hypnotic sight, as we watch nature at its most raptuous and poetic. Heh heh heh. [HIPPO NOISES] [GROANING] -Uh uh. -You see? She's eating it up. She's loving it. You're in like Flynn because of the Troma tape. I want my money back. Huh? Aw, come on, Barn. be reasonable. Give an honest guy a break, huh? This is sure fire stuff for women. Oh. Look, besides, there's absolutely, positively no refunds, either. Company policy. Is that so? Now-- [INAUDIBLE] scumbag! [GROANING] Aw, look. Perhaps I can extend you just a little bit of credit, OK? I'll work on-- -Refund! Look, do you realize the expenses involved in this kind of thing? Ah-- I had to provide boxed lunches for everyone here at the mud hole! I spent the money! I'm telling you, I don't have it. I-- I got a wife and a kid to support. I got overhead and I got telephone bills and I got insurance. I don't have the money. I'm telling you, Barn! It's a-- oh. Oh, well, ah-- look, maybe I didn't spend the money. Ah-- you sure you don't want a little credit? I've got a confession to make. Here, Mia. Take this envelope. They're made of balsa. -Huh? -Bambi, you too. Here. Don't pawn your problems off on me. I'm no angel. No, this time, it's money. I'm sorry, girls. We've all been duped. I was behind that mud therapy in the last scene. The geek in the suit sold me on the whole idea. What? It was supposed to make you happy and it turned out terribly wrong. There were people watching, and they paid good money. And I think I should share it with you. By the way, it was a nice match. I hope I haven't ruffled many feathers. But the king would have done it. Oh! That makes me mad! That made me ferocious and I'm female! I'm ferocious and I'm female and I could fight! As a matter of fact, I could fight for my freedom! I'm a ferocious female freedom fighter and nothing can stop me! Thanks for slapping me, Bambi. God I needed that. Now I don't feel so guilty. You know, I believe you. Why don't we go out for dinner or something and maybe we can talk quietly about this? What do you say? Yeah, what did you have in mind? MIA: There's a little place I know called Chay Pierre. Chay Pierre-- holy shit. I've eaten there. I had a meal there I'll remember the rest of my days. For openers, the place was 1,000 degrees and they insisted on putting us in the smoking section. [GOOFY SOUND EFFECTS] Nothing was going well. The maitre D didn't like our wine selection. [TOILET FLUSH] And the maitre D was getting impatient. My date was just coming back from the bathroom. She'd been complaining about a gas attack and stomach bloating and the waiter seemed concerned and showed her back to the table. To be honest, I wasn't crazy about the ambience of this place. They have something in mind but I wasn't sure what? It was one of those minimalist gray and maroon joints, the kind of places you see on the west side. One of the waiters had a suggestion to relieve her bloated feeling and the hiccups. That didn't work either. Another one suggested she should try scare tactics to relieve the hiccups, but, well, that didn't seem to work at all. To be honest with you, we both had felt better in our lives. Then it happened. The maitre D suggested red wine with fish. Red wine? Not with fish! [SCREAMING] That was when I knew we had to get out and get out fast. [GOOFY SOUND EFFECTS] And my girlfriend wanted to leave too, but they insisted we stay for desert. They had a flaming chocolate souffle that the chef insisted we see. And to add insult to injury, I can't tell you how long we have to wait for that dessert. I was reduced to entertaining my dinner companion with cheap spider impersonations. (SINGING): The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout. [ELVIS-LIKE MUMBLING] Come on, baby wake up. I'm doing my best spider impersonation. [ELVIS-LIKE MUMBLING] But She was not amused. Between the gas and the hiccups and the 23 kamikazes, she finally hit the meltdown level. [SNORING] Then came the cruelest joke of all-- no mints. [SCREAMING] Need I tell you it was a cash-only place and the parking valet put a scratch in my BMW Coup? Shit [INAUDIBLE]. We could always go someplace else. After that place, I don't think I'll ever be able to go to another restaurant again. I know a Chinese place. We could order in. Huh? Mmm. OK, but I want fortune cookies and not those fucked up orange slices. I hate orange slices. You want won ton soup with that? [MUMBLING] TV: [SCREAMING] WRESTLER (TV): What are you screaming about? WRESTLER (TV): [INAUDIBLE] WRESTLER (TV): Yeah, put your fist on this. Ow! [CREAKING] WRESTLER (TV): [INAUDIBLE] [BOING] Oh, help me with this ham. Ow! First Chinese food, and now &quot;Three Stooges&quot;. What a perfect date. I'll tell you [INAUDIBLE] stupid. Come here, grape head. We're the plumbers, and we're here to lay the wallpaper. [CURLY NOISES] Watch it before I tear your tonsils out. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] torture! Ow, my foot. I love you, Bambini baby, and I'm a Phil Donahue, supportive, stand by your man kind of guy. WRESTLER (TV): --genius Einstein. WRESTLER (TV): Ow! We'll find your career together, but for now, you both should disappear. it's getting hot with these guys after us. [BONK] Jeez, Barney, I'm not sure this is such a great idea. How do you know the geeks from Wrestleholics won't come looking for us? They'll never find you in this bag. Now, trust me. Did they ever find Jimmy Hoffa? Keep it down, they're here. [CLEARS THROAT] [MUMBLING] [GRUNTING] Oh, Bambi, lay off the sweets. Uh, can I help you? Hi I'm George. This here is Vito. You already know the three ugly guys. -Yeah, what's going on? -How you doing? OK, Barney. The Wrestleholics want Bambi. Now hand her over, or Vito here will do his James Cagney. James Cagney? You're trying to threaten me with an impersonation? You dirty rat. You killed my brother. You dirty rat! You killed my brother! You dirty rat! You killed my brother! Well, Barney, have you had enough? Or should I let him go on longer? Yeah, it sucks pretty bad, ah, but I can take it. Straight to the top, ma-- that's where we're going. Straight to the top, ma-- that's where we're going. Straight to the top, ma. Well, I'll be a Yankee Doodle Dandy. UGLY GUY: Oh, that sucked worse than the rest of them fucking guy. Kick his ass, [INAUDIBLE]. Let's rip him a new ass, Marty. UGLY GUY: --a new ass. [GROANING] Are you crazy? Ah! Barney! Sorry about that, Mia. [GRUNTING] Yeah, sure, you ain't going to get me. Come on! [INAUDIBLE] take us all! Oh. Hey, look out! [INTERPOSING VOICES] BARNEY: Does anybody else want to fight me? Come on, I want to fight! -Had enough? -Huh? Speak. Talk. What, am I going deaf? Talk. I've been thinking about it. BARNEY: Yeah? Your character's not so bad. BARNEY: Thank you. You ever want to go on the road, here's my card. Give me and the Colonel a call. [GRUNT] Ow! Well, if you're going to be that way about it, have this dry cleaned. I want it back by Tuesday. -Bye, Barnes. See you, Barney. Oh, see you later, Barney. -See you at the big meeting. -Hey, I know-- Take care now. --cantina where we can go, boys-- UGLY GUY: Thanks for the fun, buh-bye. UGLY GUY: Look into your soul, Barn. MAN: Hey, baby. [SNEEZE] BAMBI: Barney! Barney, are you there? Hello. [MUMBLING] What's the matter? Well, that's the only problem with my James Cagney impression. What do you mean? Well, every time I do it, I break out in zits. Perhaps I should have done Eaves Montan. Look, Bambi, why don't you marry me and end this misery for both of us? You still don't understand, do you? I've got to find the me inside myself. Well, you keep talking that way and I'm putting you back in the bag. I get the big bag this time! No way! All right, I'll get beaten up once more for you in this film for your career and that's it. That's the deal. Hey, Barney, on the way out, take the trash. This just arrived. Here. Take it into the next room and do me a favor and blow it up. See what it turns into. Groovy, man. Dig it. I think it's cool. I dig it, man. -Uh huh? Yeah. Yeah, nice Sammy Davis there, Lance, but you better save it until we really need it. IMPRESSIONIST: Hey, man. If anyone can blow it up, the candy man can. George, a one and a-- [BEAT BOXING] Take it easy, I'm booked for the Macy's parade. Mm-hm, you'll have to introduce me to Snoopy. [GROANING] -No, Tom. -Hm? [GROANING] Yes, oh wee, yes. Yes. Yes, baby. You starting without me? [MOANING] TOM: Listen, before we get all hot and heavy, let me ask you a question. Where's your [INAUDIBLE] release valve? [SUCKING SOUND] Hm, Calgon, take me away. [SPIT] Man, that's the worst crack I ever smoked. Damn. Oh, nothing like a spit facial. Really opens up the pores. [SPIT] Shit, what-- what time is it? Where's my watch? Hey, where's my arms and legs? I had arms and legs when I came in here. Shit, my wife's going to kick my ass when I get-- hey, where's my ass? [SPIT] Ah, so relaxing. Shit, ain't got no ass, ain't got no arms and legs. Where the fuck is the door, motherfucker? I want out. Mmm. [GURGLING UNDERWATER] SNAKE: These boys got fucking hair on them! What are these, Chinese boys? What [INAUDIBLE] Pagoda? Park this shit! Hey! Hey, where the fuck am I? Damn! [INAUDIBLE] I spent $200 [INAUDIBLE] I can't find my [INAUDIBLE]. Someone help me! Somebody better come in here! Hey, lady! Hey bitch, tell me where the hell I am, huh? All I know is, I came here for a birthday party with my cousin Arnold. [GASP] Next thing I know, I wake up in a trash, fucking no arms, no legs, fuck [INAUDIBLE]. I got no watch, I got no money. I can't find my way home. That's right, I spent $200 here on crack and you don't pull no shit with me. Don't look at me like that because I'll kick your ass. Now, listen. You think you can get away with that without buying me dinner? SNAKE: I want my arms and legs, God damn it! Now don't fuck around! I can't be going home with no arms and legs because my wife will kick my ass! Now don't fuck with me! We're going to do that right! Don't play that! If I had my arms and legs, we wouldn't be playing this shit. What you trying to do? Hey, get your-- don't put-- you be wiping your ass with that dirty rag, go put it in my face now.

Now, hang up the phone-- BAMBI (PHONE): No, wait-- --and get back on the mats. BAMBI (PHONE): Don't-- You know something? Even after bad phone sex, I still want a smoke. Boss, blow some my way. Into my noise, OK? [SNORT] Now put that one out and do it with an unfiltered cigarettes. Vito, I'm not supporting your habit anymore. You want your own, you buy your own and put them in your own mouth. You got any threes? -Go fish. Everybody dancing, dancing Party, party! Just look at me. I want to go home smelling like an ashtray. Disco, disco [INAUDIBLE]. All right, I'm a regular [INAUDIBLE] Walter! Hey, you're a pretty good dancer. Yeah, I got some help. I got a snake in my pants. Hey, look, man. I'm sorry I'm in your pants. I was looking for directions. I didn't know there was another snake in here. I'm not trying to date your balls, man. I'm just trying to find my way home. Some motherfucker opened up her pants and get [INAUDIBLE] in a bathtub. Hey, monkey-face. I was-- -Not right now! -Ah, fuck you. [MUMBLING] Isn't that Robert Goulet over there?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Attention, passengers. Attention, passengers.

Please return your stewardesses to an upright position. Thank you. So, Nate, how's the trolley convention in Akron? Oh, super. I saw the whole future of trophy making, and it's one word-- cryogenics. MAN: Huh. NATE: Little frozen midgets on top of those trophies instead of those brass models, which are way too expensive. Freeze dried midgets-- that's the future, my boy. Uh, I got a short uncle who's out of work. Great! When he's dead, have him call me. Hm. Mm-hm. Hey, wake up, stupid. It's me, your boss! Hey, boss.

The place comes with a few acres! Now you fucked up my Mary Kay stuff! Pardon me. Listen, I got to be honest with you. We're friends of Nathan's over here. You know, I'm beginning to think this real estate business isn't the glamour work it's cracked up to be. -Hm. -Hey! You turn around over there so I can hit you in the back of the head. Go on! Oh, you mean like this here? Hey, ever do elephant tranquilizer, baby? One whiff of this and you'll be seeing Dumbo in your sleep! Heh heh heh. You won't be able to go to the circus anymore. THUG: Take off that designer rope jewelry. Turn her over. Eh, that's good. Great, now get out of my shot. Yeah, it's the latest thing-- combination telephone and barbell. I'm importing them. Every time you take a call, you get a great workout. Ah, that's great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it right here. Don't worry, you'll get that order for 10,000 trophies. I got the model right here. Yeah, don't worry. No, no, I'm not set up for cryogenics yet. But, uh, give me a call if you run into any dead midgets looking for work. Male, female, transvestite, I don't care. Mmm, ah. Oh, I can see it now, your supple lines immortalized forever, cast in artificial bronze. They'll be smoothed down to shiny perfection, buffed for all the world to see. When I reproduce you in 1/12 scale, you'll be worshipped by some and fondled by millions. That turned up little nose, those dimples on your cheeks, that little Cupid smile, that silky white skin immortalized forever. Oh yeah, airplane six coming in for a landing. Open up your hanger! Oh ha! Hey, listen. As long as I'm down here, you mind if I stick my tongue in your ear! La la la la la la. Whoa! I may be drugged, but I'm not dead, you disgusting, slobbering anteater. Now it's my turn. NATHAN: Oh, oh, ow! Thank you. [FIGHTING SOUNDS] Party in 203, pass it on. Hey, get [INAUDIBLE]. [GROANING] I love it, I love it, I love it. Eh, eh, eh, oh. [GROANING] Listen, maybe you better hold my calls, huh? Ya! [GROANING] I said close with a C. Listen, show me your box. Ow, damn it, that's not what I meant! [FIGHTING SOUNDS] Hey, your right leg asleep? Mine certainly is. I can move it a little bit, though. Actually, it's more my right arm. Got any nines? Go fish. Come on, boys. Let's save Bambi! [PANTING] Well, there you are. Hey, Bambini. What's going on? Ah, ah, did you rent a place? Nein. That's no in German. Hm. Yeah, well, let's get out of this scene, Bambi. Come on. You too, monkey-face. Let's go. [PARROT NOISES] How did it feel? Smooth, real smooth. Real refreshing. Say, why does she smell like that? Didn't you know? She bathes in my special solution of vodka and moose phlegm. Keeps her skin smooth as macaroon paste. Here's some hot coffee to help your bowels move. [MOAN] She can't shit today, so I made her some strong, hot coffee. That'll loosen her up real good. Last night, she complained of headaches, fever, and constipation. [BURP] But a good swim in cold water and a-- These broads are sick. DEVORAH: --and she'll be so loose, she'll open up like Boulder Dam. She might even pass some vital organs. Eh, that's very nice, but what about Wrestleholics? DEVORAH: Oh yes, we all know attendance is down and we're in trouble, but I've got a solution. We need one big card. Your little friend Bambi-- we've got to get her to stop screwing around with her career and get back into the ring. And I know just how to do it. What do you mean I can't marry two women? It's the law, pal. That ain't the law where I come from. My daddy had nine women. But if you say it's the law, well, it's the law. Which one will I choose? They're both so pretty. The young one is nice. Oh, what a dilemma. Help me! PASTOR: Eh, pick the tall one. Here's the deal. You touch his, he touches yours, bada boom. You're married. Heh heh heh. Excuse me, Pastor Reverend. Uh, Bambi-- [CLEARS THROAT] --where exactly did you find this guy? [CLEARS THROAT] I'm not much of a religious man, Reverend, but what kind of service was that? Eh, the $10 kind. Here, sign a marriage certificate right here. Hm. The King-- and by the way, what church did you say you were a priest of? PASTOR: First Church of Mohammad Ali. Oh. Uh, Bambi, can I have a word with you, honey dear? Heh heh heh. Best service yet, Father Dominic. I was really moved. Nice sales job, too, on the combined honeymoon package. Where are you sending them? London? Paris? Madrid? Barcelona? My boy, I'm going to send them on a trip they'll never forget. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. Ah ha a. I had an inspiration while I was watching Judy in &quot;A Star Was Born&quot;. Let's make the arena four corners and we'll have two chairs here where the fighters can sit. And then we'll have canvas on the floor, I figure a nice mauve color. And, uh, what-- what do you think? -Four corners. -Hm? -You're a genius. -Mmm! And canvas too! Hm. My how incredible. Ah. Excuse me. He's a simpering idiot. Just go with the flow. He's the only guy who will rent us a ring. IDIOT: Anyone for chips and guac? [INAUDIBLE] girls. Here's the love test. So this is the bridal suite? Huh. Where's the heart-shaped bed and the view of the ocean they promised? Yeah, where's the fucking hot tub? Now, you all quit your bitching. Ah, I'm going to limber up my love machine before hitting the sheet. PHONE: Wing, wing. Uh, hello? Honeymoon's over, jack off. [MOANING] Riddle me this. What's got four legs, an ugly face, a bad case of dicosis and is sitting on the floor of my basement right now? Give up? -Huh. What's up, doc? Get into your wrestling gear. You're shitting me. We got a match. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Oh ah, I got to take a dump. Cover for me. Go for it! [INTERPOSING VOICES] BARNEY: [INAUDIBLE] oh, I'm pinching a loaf. I can't control my right arm! Hey, is this the employees lounge? Members only! Get the hell out of here! Beat it, jack off! Well, I got a dump truck real bad! Our bathrooms are private! Then give me some toilet paper! Hey, wipe your ass with this! The hell, are you guys in charge of the men's room! [GROANING] Oh yeah. You had to [INAUDIBLE] shit! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Oh. Come on! Oh man. [INAUDIBLE] in my eye. Hey, there's a bathroom. All right. I bet that's Larry [INAUDIBLE] under that mask! [GROANING] Is this how you get your kicks, man? Watching a guy taking a shit? You fuckhead, you knocked me down for wearing white? I just want to use a toilet! Oh, man, that's what they all say. Besides, I'm not even done yet. I had a big lunch! Yeah, what did you have for lunch! Oh, [INAUDIBLE] Ah! They love me. This is my crowd tonight! [GROANING] But you must validate the parking. It's the least you could do. These girls can't afford those rates. Look, [INAUDIBLE] validate! I just want to get out of here. Listen, stupid! You've got to stay in the ring. Otherwise, he'll make you pay for your own parking. -Ugh. -Oh please, stay. I'll-- I'll pay for your parking. She'll pay for my parking? It's a deal! [GROANING] Hey, can't a guy take a leak in private? BARNEY: I'm just looking for some toilet paper! -Hey, wipe your ass with this! -No way. I got piles. [GROANING] OK, I'll see if there's any in here. Hey, how about this here? -Naw, too thin. -Oh sorry. Too thin. Mm-hm. I know where the paper is, but let him suffer. Ha ha. I better let the broad and the kid out. Let's see how it takes me to get to the other side of the room. Ah, two seconds-- not bad. All that running made me hungry. Ribs! I better start the grill. [SCREAMING] Oh boy, we're going to have ribs! My ribs! Oh shit! I dropped all the God damn barbecue stuff! Fucking kids leaving all the toys all over the friggin' house! Ugh. -Hey, what's that? -It's the coleslaw! All right, well, just put it-- you spilled it all, you asshole! Hey, Barney! Help the old lady get the barbeque together. I'm going on a beer run. Yeah, you got enough money? Yeah, plenty. I'll be right back. There you go. Ah! Hey, you believe the hand's quicker than the eye? -Yeah. -Well, jack me off quick! Nobody's watching. We've got ribs and slaw. How about a shoulder chop? Oh man, what you doing? I'm wearing white! What's-- are you stupid? Ribs and slaw's enough, you understand? We got enough for-- how much you want? I said ribs and slaw is enough, understand? You understand? OK, all right. All right now, go get the beer. [SCREAMING] PHONE: Wing wing, wing-- [INAUDIBLE] Deli. Oh, hi, Barney. What's up? When monkey-face gets there, tell him to pick me up a pack of cigarettes, a bottle of catchup, and a pint of coleslaw. You got it. [CHEERING] Guess what, Bambi? We're going to have a barbeque! Oh yeah, slaw, [INAUDIBLE]. Better get this match over with! I'm starved! CROWD: Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! [GASP] This isn't the men's room! Listen, I'm married, but I still like a little on the side. DEVORAH: No, no, I'm a frigid Catholic! [MOANING] [GROANING] I quit! I'm the best wrestler there is and I'm proud of it! And I just took all the skin off my chin. [MOANING] By the way, you're standing in quicksand, stupid. Attention, all extras! Please leave the set, as we are now beginning to shoot in cinemascope and there's not enough room in the screen for all of you. [SCREAMING] Oh, Andre! Andre, you're cured! What did Doctor Mengele say? He said he got the part of Rommel in [INAUDIBLE]! Oh, that's wonderful! And I've learned that I can't hide behind a pompadour and a Karate punch, that I've got to be me! [ELVIS-LIKE MUMBLING] I whooped the [INAUDIBLE]. Now, take it easy [INAUDIBLE]. CROWD: Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt! Tuna melt!
