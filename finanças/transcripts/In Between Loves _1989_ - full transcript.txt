I've already arranged everything for you come to my home put me on camera I'll take you around to dig them out the world-famous butcher talks interview me did you kill them? Something wrong a weak TV station can thrive not by means of equipment but by events the world-famous butcher agrees to describe his crimes what's wrong with that?

I won't do anything bad for my reputation ok, I quit I'm taking this to the other station Jenny I'm taking it to the other station come back don't, the other station may hear that didn't you say it's a scoop of global scale?

No, it can't that's not being fair to the murdered photograph me if I killed myself before the TV camera wouldn't it be more sensational and helpful? Don't be silly, don't... It won't work keep away go on keep away if you don't, I'll stab harder who'd take care of you if I were dead? It'd be a pity to leave you alone don't die, don't die come here.

My reputation's ruined Jenny tung, you don't have to go on police supt chen, did the suspect say anything happened to Jenny tung in the house? What do you mean? Did the suspect threaten her, for instance to do something against her will? According to his testimony she did everything in his home of her own volition sorry did he do it to her? Do what? Having sex having sex? I tried to take her statement on that she dept smiling without answering outrageous! He's coming out get over there why did you make such a serious joke? Because I was anxious to see miss tung have you been secretly in love with her for long? That's an embarrassing question would you kill for her? No, I don't have the guts the real killer is still at large do you think what you did would stimulate the killer to do something else?
