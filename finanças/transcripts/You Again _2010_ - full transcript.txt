I can't How do u? Where's the entrance? Is it not? Into the camera. Hello. My name. Right. My name is Marni Olivia Olsen, and I'm a senior here at Ridgefield High. What's life like for a high school student in 2002? Well,for starters,my initials spell Moo! Life is hard. With a little luck,u'll rise above it. Unforunately,I never had much luck. Not even a little. Dating all the way back to my freshman year Sorry. Saved. Sorry. Saved. I come from a small town in Northern California, and in a school as small as mine Oh,sorry. Saved. there's always one person that is so famous that they outshine all the others. In my class,I was that person. Were u on the squad last year? Shh! All right,ladies,let's do this! Here we go! Five,six,seven and eight. And one,cross two,three,four, five,turn,six,seven and eight. Kick! All right,let's go this time. Good luck,girls! Big smiles! Here we go! Five,six,seven and eight. And one I read somewhere that who u are in high school determines who u'll be for the rest of ur life. Kick! I seriously hope that's not the case. Then again,the odds aren't exactly in my favor. That's my big brother,Will. He's the greatest. At,like,everything. Let's go,Gators,let's go! Out of my way! Go,go,Gators! Go,go,go,Gators! Go,go,go,Gators! Nice work,Gator! P.S.,u were prettier with the mask on. Are u speaking to me yet? I'm not in the mood right now,Marni. I just wanted u to know that I'm really sorry. And those girls are right. I am a loser. You know? Whoa,whoa. Which girls? What? No. No,no,no,Who called u a loser,Marni? I'll talk to them right now. Who called u a loser? Doesn't matter,Will. You can't always protect me from it. It's true. I wish u could see how incredible u are,Marni. You just have to believe in urself,'cause once u do that, u're gonna be able to do anything u want. And,of course,Will was right. Once I changed the way I saw myself,the past was history. I ditched the braces,I got contacts and I started spending more than eight dollars on a haircut. I've come a long way since those horrible days. But if it weren't for the determination of that little girl from Ridgefield, the woman standing in front of u wouldn't be here today, working at one of the top PR firms in Los Angeles, telling a bunch of junior publicists about the days when I was the poster child for the geek squad. You can't control the things that happen to u, but u can control the way u react to them. It's all perception. That is what public relations is all about. Thank u. And good luck. Nice job. Thank u. Great speech. Inspiring. Thank u,sir,very much. Now,I'm gonna need u to pack up ur office. What? Did u just say that I need to pack up my office? That's right. But I only asked for two days off, and it's for my brother's wedding. There's an opening in the New York office. VP. It's urs. It... You... I... The VP for... Unless,of course,u have a problem with a huge promotion. No,I don't! I certainly do not. I don't. Thank u,sir! You've earned it. I am excited to see everyone,too,Mom. I can't believe how quickly this all came together. I know,and it's gonna be so beautiful. Joanna's Aunt Mona is spending a fortune for this wedding. I tried to get in touch with her to say I thought it was too much, and I got back a text saying, "Happy to do it,can't wait to meet u all." I just feel bad that I haven't met Joanna yet. I know. Isn't it funny? You guys all went to high school together,u don't know each other. Wait,we all went to high school together? I thought u knew. No. Well,all Will did was send me a picture, but she didn't look familiar. Ridgefield High was really small. I don't remember a Joanna. That's because she didn't go by Joanna in high school. She went by a nickname. Deedee. Deedee? No,um Titi? Titi? No,I can't believe I'm blanking on this. JJ? That's it! JJ! Joanna,JJ,yeah! No! No! No! No. Nope. Ma'am? "Fasten ur seat belt" sign's on. I need u to return to ur seat. Mom,are u telling me Will is... Shh! Please! I've listened to u talk about how ur "cats are just like people" for the last 45 minutes. Ma'am,u must remain seated. It's for ur own safety. Mom,hold on one second. I'm sorry,Heather. Um,This is an emergency. My brother is about to marry the girl who single-handedly ruined my life in high school. So,if u don't mind,would u please back off? Sorry,Mom. I... I'm sorry,do we have a problem? I don't know,do we have a problem? Is ur brother marrying ur arch nemesis? So u didn't know it was the same girl? Nobody knew. My brother was a senior when I was a sophomore. I can't blame him for not keeping up with my high school soap opera. Pretzel? There are seven billion people on this planet, and I get stuck with Satan's spawn as my sister-in-law. She is the reason I left home in the first place. Marni,let me tell u about bullies. They're just like terrorists,only they're emotional terrorists. You can never let them get the upper hand, so the best thing that u can do in this situation is remain calm and show her that u are in control. Besides,I don't care if the Ridgefield mascot getting ploughed got over a thousand hits on YouTube. A million. A million hits? Yeah. Wow,u gotta get me that link. Will do. The bottom line is, things have changed since then. You need to go back,and u show JJ what u're made of. Maybe u're right. Maybe I'm just overreacting. Hey. You got this. I have got this. You got it. Oh! There she is! Oh,my little girl is home! Hi. Oh,sweetheart,four months is too long! Hey. Hi. Why are u so tall? Look at u! You look so great! And we miss u so much. I miss u guys,too. Oh,yeah? Well,not as much as u're about to miss shotgun. In ur dreams. Ben! What,Mom? Joanna always lets me sit shotgun. You guys do a lot of stuff with Joanna? We do everything with Joanna. We don't do everything. Take ur sister's bag,be a gentleman. You're home! Mark! Honey,she's home! Ben,will u get the phone,please? Yeah,sure. Coco Puff! Come here,buddy! Coco! Sweetheart Joanna took Coco to the groomer's. Everybody needs to look their best for this wedding, including Coco Puff. Hey,Mark,she's home! Hey,babe. We're a full house this weekend. You and Joanna are gonna have to bunk in,I hope u don't mind. Oh,come on,Mom! Oh,Marni Olivia Olsen. OK. It will just be like the slumber party I was never invited to. I'm gonna get dinner. Honey! She's home! Busted! Oh,u scared me! There he is! Come here! Ridgefield's legal golden boy! Look at u. You look gorgeous. Thank u. Can u believe this?Because,Marni,it wasn't that long ago,u remember? We were kids up in that tree house,swearing we'd never get married. I guess some things change,huh? I'm counting on it. Is that my little mover and shaker? Oh,baby. Hi,Daddy! Hi. Oh,my gosh,u look great! You're so thin! I have lost a couple of pounds. Thank u for noticing. You look fantastic. Thanks. One of those. Off to the side. while rolling,it is so crucial to have one inch wide and nine inches in length. And u finish it just like that. u are a culinary wonder. Hey,Look who I found. Marni,Marni,Marni. Look at u! You are so beautiful! Thank u? Do u know that I have waited so long for this moment? It's finally here. You think u waited long? 'Cause I... There's just so much to say. Believe me,I know. But I don't want to do it in front of them. But first,let me just say how nice it is to finally It's OK. meet u! Excuse me? Will has told me so much about u, but now here u are! I cannot wait to spend the next four days learning all about my brand-new sister! Hug sis! The salad looks good. There he is! Coco Puff! Come here,buddy! Oh,Coco Puff! Come to Mommy! Yeah! That's my boy. Coco Puff,dinner time. Joanna,I'm not sure I feel comfortable starting dinner without ur aunt. I think it's very rude. Oh,no,no,no. Don't worry about Aunt Mona. She's just running late. OK. You ready,honey? Ready! All right. Batter up. I'm sorry,are we executing Dad tonight? You know how ur father's always been so interested in the whole mind-body connection? And since we can't have Will's best man looking fat on Saturday That's right. You do not look fat! l'm trying the Yamaguchi diet. A colleague at the hospital told me about it. Most people don't realize when they're full. They need an empty plate to tell them. When u wear a blindfold, u rely on ur stomach. I've already lost six pounds. And where did u go to medical school? Ben! Well,I think it's a very smart way to stay fit. Thank u,Joanna. Mm-hmm. Let's eat! Wow. So,uh,how did u two meet? We were at this little karaoke bar at the beach, and Will was onstage doing his best Hall & Oates. Not my finest moment. Really? No,it wasn't. Ben. He was so cute,I just had to save him. So I got onstage and we sang it together. And she has been saving me ever since. That's right. You know,I just think it's unbelievable that in a small town like Ridgefield, Will and Joanna could grow up practically down the block from each other and not run into each other until now. It's funny,isn't it? It's hilarious! Isn't it? I mean,that our paths haven't crossed till now? Isn't that funny? Yeah. It's so funny! Weird. So,Marni,Will tells me that u work for this big,fancy PR firm in LA? Guilty. Actually,since u mentioned it,I have news. I got a promotion. What? And I am now VP of our New York office. And I was... A promotion in New York? Yes. Oh,honey,congratulations! That's fantastic! We're so proud of u! That is awesome. You get to meet real celebrities? Like,that is really cool! You know,enough about me. I'm dying to know what u're doing. You know? I mean,what have u been up to? My life is dull by comparison. Oh,I doubt it. I'm sure u keep it just as interesting as u did in high school,right? I mean,I'd love to hear how ur wonderful life has turned out. Well,um Yeah. Yeah. After my parents died, I took a hard look at my life,and realized I wasn't really making the right choices. So I enrolled in nursing school, I decided to focus all of my energy into helping those less fortunate. Wow. Good... Good for u. No,"good" doesn't even begin to describe it. Yeah,I kind of became obsessed with helping people in need. Well,since,Will and I love children. as an entry-level RN,they promoted me to head clinical nurse. I tried to put in a good word. She wouldn't let me. Oh,Dad. Oh,Dad. Between the hospital. Yeah,it,actually... It helps build the self-esteem of... Let's be honest,u can only run a suicide hotline so long before it starts to take its toll. Do u still have that number? Ben! my gosh,I have been talking about myself way too much. No,no,no.Baby,it's fine. Trust me. I,for one, had no idea u were such a giver. I know,right?I'm so proud of her.I'm so proud to call u my bride. Oh! Bride! He said it again! Gail! He's getting married! I know! I really need a refill. He has been saying bride. Today,I think it's 16 Anybody need anything? How many more days? Does anybody want anything? Of course we will. But... Great. Oh,my gosh! The Lambada! Jeez,Mom,u scared me! So that Joanna's pretty great,right? Yeah,almost too good to be true. I think so,too. I think it's her sweetness. You know,her genuine warmth. Uh,where is the recycling? Oh! Come with me,please. There's the recycling,and Wow,this looks beautiful. Maybe Joanna could sleep out here. Marni. Listen. How come u didn't mention New York? I'm really proud of u. That's fantastic. Thank u.I don't know.I think I've just been preoccupied with the whole Joanna thing,and Don't u think it's odd that she doesn't remember me? Ridgefield High was not that big. I don't remember half the people I went to high school with. Yeah,but u're Gail Byer. Everyone loved u. You can't relate to what I went through. Really? You wanna bet? Listen,nobody gets through high school unscathed,Marni. Nobody. You didn't tell me u had problems in high school. Because what's past is past. Look,if u had a problem with Joanna in the past, u can fix it now. Remember Everyone deserves a second chance. I know. Joanna's Aunt Mona is here! I can't believe my little Joanna's getting married. I know. It's crazy,right? I'm so happy for u. Come meet the family. Aunt Mona this is Will's sister,Marni. What a pleasure. Nice to meet u. And this is Will's mom. Gail? Ramona. Whoa! You guys know each other? Gail! Ramona! How long has it been? Well,don't tell,or I'll have to strangle u. Who can remember? How do u two know each other? Uh,we went to school together. We were best friends. Very,very close. Wow. You look great. Stop. No,no,really. You look amazing. You haven't aged at all. Oh,well... She looks computer-generated. Ben. Thank u. You must be Ben. You know,I have something that I think u will like. Fallout Four?This doesn't even come out until the summer! What do u say,ung man? Thank u! I cannot wait to go play this! I got... I gotta go! Have fun. Oh,and Marni. You know,I think I have the right size. Is this Brian Reyes? Brian who? And this is from his new collection? 'Cause I thought that it was pre-sold out. Brian is a doll. He always stays at my hotels. He always stays at the Sullenger.u own the Sullenger Hotel? The Sullenger Group. Actually,we now own 14 properties. I can't believe it myself. I can't believe that my mom didn't tell me that she was friends with one of Forbes' 100 most powerful women. Please,that silly list changes all the time. Yeah,but u've been on it for,like,ten years. Eleven. But,u know,what's most important to me is that when someone stays at my hotel,they feel right at home. "Like home but better," I always say. Which reminds me You two have worked so hard on this wedding. It would mean so much to me if u would spend a week at any one of my resorts Bali,Maui,Paris. Are u? Yes! No. No. Yes. I insist. Now,Ramona,u know u did not have to do all this. You've already done so much for the wedding. Do u think I'm trying to buy people's affection? Did it work? Yeah! This is so exciting.I mean,doesn't it feel like we're already family? Let's not just stand here. Come on in,family! Put ur feet up. Have a drink,Ramona. I think we've got some French champagne. There are cowbells on every door,and we have no beds. I have 400 beds stranded somewhere in the Indian Ocean. I mean,it's still beautiful. It's Switzerland. I love Switzerland. You've never been to Switzerland. Yeah,but I love chocolate. I love cheese. I love clocks! Well,then we all have to spend some time at my new place. How about Christmas in Gstaad? Yes! We can take the jet. Count me in. No way! You own ur own plane? Oh,darling,sometimes I think it owns me. I am on it non-stop just flitting from one continent to the next. Not to mention all the back-and-forth with my divorce. Michael and I have been in litigation 14 months. We were only married for seven,so Ramona,I'm sorry. That must be so difficult. Yeah,it is,but,u know, it's nothing that a delicious piece of whatever this is can't fix. Oh,Mark has been doing this kind of program that "As the eyes are the window to the stomach so shall we pull the curtain." How did u know that? I had no idea the Yamaguchi Diet had come to the States! I simply swear by it! Me,too! Hello. Hello,darling. Georgia King,the wedding planner. Geor... Georgia King is the wedding planner? She is like Southern royalty. Every single one of our clients wants her to do their wedding. Thank u,darling. Look at these two. You guys are so adorable. Gail,doesn't that just take u right back to when u were young? You know,ur mother may not have told u this,but back in high school, she was quite the superstar. no,she told us.I mean,we know. I was hardly a superstar. Oh,u were a supernova. Every girl wanted to be just like ur mother. Well,not all at the same time. Wait. You were cheerleading captain at Ridgefield? Mm-hmm. My senior year,I was varsity. Me,too! Joanna! I was cheerleading captain at Ridgefield! How come I didn't know that? Joanna,have u ever heard of the Byer Flyer? yeah,I mean,it's the signature move of the varsity squad. Yeah? You were the "Byer" in the Byer Flyer? I mean,I originated the move. Oh,my gosh! Your mother is a legend! Oh,I'm not a legend. I'm not a legend. Gator Power. Let's do it! Oh,no,no. They still do it? Go,Gators! Go,go,go,Gators! I haven't done it in 30 years! Dad,can I please borrow ur blindfold? Come on! Go,go,Gators! Get in line. Go,go,go,Gators! Go,go,go,Gators! No,I haven't done it in such a long time! Go,go,go,Gators! Go,go,Gators! Go,go,go,Gators! Ready? OK! Ridgefield Gators are out tonight. We're gonna dribble and fight,fight,fight! Yeah! Snap those jaws,let's begin. Ridgefield Gators gonna win,win,win! Go Gators! Unbelievable! I haven't done that in 30 years! Oh! Boy,the two of u together again. Must feel like u're right back at Ridgefield High. Oh,yes,it feels just like old times. Whoo! Gator Power! Mom! All I want is an apology. You can't prove it was me. I suppose I should commend Joanna for changing her life and just do what Mom says and forget about it and move on. Yeah.u know,that's probably a good idea.I mean,u two are roommates now. Ben! Thank u. Let me help u. How gallant. You know,Joanna is my only family now,and it's been hard to imagine this wedding without her parents here. Of course. So it means the world to me to be able to share it with u and ur beautiful family. It means a lot to us,too. Good night. Good night,Ramona. Well,that was normal. Right? Yeah. You seem surprised. You two were friends,weren't u? Yeah,we were best friends. Yeah,all the way through grade school, and then we were close in high school. Right up until our senior prom,and then she... she kind of had a little breakdown, and something happened,and I... She said she never wanted to see me again. I don't know what happened,really. Honey,it was... That's a long time ago. And u always say everyone deserves a second chance. So stop worrying about it. You honestly don't remember me from high school? No,I... I'm so sorry. High school was such a blur.Please don't take it personally. Slumber party! Oh,look at u two. Now,I'm not interrupting any pillow fights,am I? Not yet. I just came to say goodnight to my lady. My favorite! Yeah? Does that smell good? Don't u just love this? I'll give u two a minute. Wow. Love what u've done with the place. Oh,my curtains! Did u know I made those from scratch? Uh,yeah. I thought u said u were going to bed. My room is a little crowded right now. I thought I would just hang up here with u,if that's cool. Yeah. It's cool. Thanks. I thought u said his sister was hot. Oh,I accept. Mark,do u remember Denmark? Of course I do. Yeah. I was there. I know. Do u remember the room service? No,I really don't. Hey! Good morning,sunshine. Hey. Oh,Coco Puff,there's my boy! Coco Puff,no! We do not growl at guests. I am so sorry. He'll warm up to u. He probably just doesn't recognize u. Yeah. I get that a lot. Check it out,Marni. The Hawaii trip. Remember when u got nailed in the face by that baby octopus. You were like... It wouldn't come off! She was so sad. She was so brave,though. She was so brave. Let's turn the page. Um,hello,we need to go right now because we have a lot to do before our dance lesson. Dance lesson? If the bride and groom want dancing, we're gonna give them dancing. Hey! That means u need to pick up Grandma. Oh,honey,she can't wait to see u. Come on,Coco. Let's go. She really can't. That was all she would talk about the other day at the mall,Marni. You go shopping with our grandma? Oh,yeah. Bunny and I,we're like sorority sisters. All right,ladies,come on.We're wastin' time.Let's go.Let's do it. Yes! I'm so excited about our dance. Come on,Marni. Chop-chop. Marni,seriously,don't worry about it. You'll have plenty of time to wash up before my bridal shower this afternoon. So,Will,how'd u pop the question? I... I proposed in the tree house,actually. Our tree house? Uh-huh. It's my wedding gift to Joanna. I'm having it moved from Mom and Dad's to our new place, once it's finally built. You're moving the tree? You can't move the tree house,Will. You and I built that with Dad with our bare hands. That's like Olsen family history. OK,Marni,how about when u come in town,u can come visit it at our place. OK? How's that? Honey,our song! It's fate. Stop! Sorry. I thought that plastic bag was a kitten. What? Check it out. Ridgefield High. So many fond memories. But,u know,if I knew then what I know now, I would've done a lot of things differently. How about u,Joanna? Any regrets? Well,actually,yeah. I mean,if I could start all over,I would probably get a head start on my community service and charitable outreach programs. I would've had a boyfriend.u probably had lots of boyfriends,right,Joanna? No,I wouldn't say "lots." I heard that one of the cheerleaders had a different boyfriend in each school in the district, and that when she'd bleed one dry,she'd just move on to the next one. Hey,Joanna,u were on the cheerleading squad. Do u remember who that was? What's ur point,Marni? No point. Just wondered if she remembered who this low self-esteem gold-digger was. I heard she even dated the Wilson High School principal for a while. She did not! I mean,that's just a rumor I heard that Judy Karbash made up because she was jealous of said cheerleader. Do u guys mind if I change the music? Love this song! Don't u guys just love this song? Joanna! I said,"'Cougar? ' I'm old enough to be ur grandmother!" we better get going if we wanna make it on time for our dance lesson. Bunny,can I help u get ready? That would be delightful. OK. You know what? u've done enough.I'll help her get ready. Don't be silly. I'm happy to help Grandma Bunny. Well,she's my Grandma Bunny,by blood. I've got this. They're fighting over me. So,Grandma,is there anything I can help u with? Here,dear. They were a little loose. We can't have them falling out on the dance floor. I don't think I don't know how. They're just dentures! Get over it. Now,and be sure and press hard,dear. We need a tight seal. I might be kissing later. OK. There we go. OK. Oh,seriously? Oh,dear! I can fix that. Now,hold still. Grandma,no! I really gotta give u credit. You've got this whole good girl act down to a T,don't u? Excuse me? You even had me believing that u didn't remember who I was. But We Are The Champions? You really showed ur true colors,didn't u,JJ? Joanna. Tim! Oh,Tim! Wow! You look well! Thank u. Thank u for saying that. You,Wow. I wasn't expecting to see u. What,how Well,u look... You changed ur hair. No,I didn't,but Tim,this is Will,Marni and Grandma Bunny. It was really great seeing u. Oh,my gosh. It's awesome. I mean,but,unfortunately,we've gotta get going. So We don't need to rush. They're not gonna start without u guys. Let's talk to Tim and hear about way back. What is ur phone number?Someone keeps blocking ur number on my phone. I think it's a glitch. It's 555-0172. That's my cell. I'm also on Facebook. And the Twitter. What about u,Joanna? Do u Twitter? Can we Twitter together? u wanna,maybe I have a pool. You wanna catch a movie sometime? Oh,uh Tim,Will and I are getting married. I hadn't heard about this. Yup,this Saturday. This Saturday? Hm-hm. That is great! That is so soon for a marriage. That is so soon. Lovebirds. That is great. Gotta give u one of these,then. Married to... And u're sure that's this Saturday? Hey,man. Keep it real.And u got a terrific girl here. Move. Bye,Tim. Call me! That was awkward. We dated in college. Long story. Right. We're not gonna go into that. Let's go dance! You guys dated? Oh! Here they are. Hi! It's happening! Marni! Did u get a haircut? You did. Let me see! It's,um,It's cute. It's cute,bangs. You haven't had bangs since high school. I know. It's cute. How was Grandma's? It was fun when Grandma wasn't fawning all over her new BFF,Joanna. Honey. Your grandma loves u. Don't turn everything into a competition. Hola,everyone! I am so sorry I'm late. Oh,look at this! Oh,Gail,when was the last time we danced together? Could it have been prom? Is that what u're wearing? Yes. Why? You know what I love about ur look is it's so sporty. Thank u. So American. Ladies and gentlemen,ur wedding extraordinator, Miss Georgia King! Whack! Heart! Brava. Yes! Oh,Bonjour. Guten tag. Hola. Aloha. Konichiwa. Hi,y'all. I'm Georgia King. And I am ur wedding extraordinator. And this lovely man to my right is the owner of this Off-Broadway dance studio,and my personal helper,Timothy. Oh,look,it's Tim! I want u to think of me as the engine room to ur Love Boat. And our first "port of call" is the crucial wedding dance. Now,since Will and Joanna first said "I love u" at the Mardi Gras, I have choreographed a Brazilian Carnival Lambada dance number. Now,this dance number is the forbidden dance that bestows good luck and fertility on the happy couple. All right! Let's get this party started! Oh,Marni! I'm so sorry. We were expecting more people. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Olsen! Charlie! You made it! Hey,I'm sorry I'm late. The flight was delayed Don't even worry about it. Marni,u remember Charlie,right? Uh,sort of. Come here,u! Come here,man. Oh Good to see u. You,too. Hi! Marni! Ah! Wow. You look grown-up! That's what I did. Couldn't stop it. At last! For every lovely lady,there is a gentleman. Marcie,I want u to dance with Charlie. And,u two,I want u to work on that bride and groom dance. Right over there. I'm gonna come help u. Just right that way,that's it. Remember,u're a swan. Long neck. You might wanna bend ur knees a little bit there. it's the Lambada,not the foxtrot. Oh,OK. He's acting like it's a foxtrot. So,what am I doing? Uh,I'll just teach u what we learned. It's ur left hand, foot,goes forward,together,back and together. Forward and together,back and together. Don't be intimidated. I've had two hours more practice. Oh,OK. Thank u. Mind if I drive for a while? I mean,what is she trying to prove? Well,if I had her body... You'd what? I'd shut my mouth before the next stupid thing comes out. Don't try this at home. It's strictly for professionals. Roar! Right and left,and right and left. Wee! Wait! forget this. Mark,"Byer Flyer," on my count. Spot me. What? Tim! You ready? No! Two scoops of crazy with a side of coo-coo-cachoo. I guess this means u didn't get ur apology,huh? I don't think there's gonna be an apology. But she remembers me. Oh,yeah,and this is all just part of her little act. Everybody loves a good story,and that's exactly what she's giving 'em. She has got Will totally brainwashed. Come on,Marni. Don't u think u're overreacting? He's giving her the tree house. What? Ben! I need to leave a little early for baseball practice. I'm gonna run by Ramona's hotel!We'll leave in about 5minutes,OK? We gotta save him,Benny.Will has protected us his entire life. Now,it's our turn to protect him. What are we supposed to do,Marni? He's getting married in,like,48 hours. Ben. Ben. In PR,48 hours is a lifetime. All we have to do is isolate the problem, calculate a plan and institute a solution. We gotta get him alone. Hey,Will. What are u doing right now? Can I talk to u? Actually,can it wait?Because Joanna's gonna be back soon, and I wanna sneak in a quick run here. No way! I was just thinking that,that I need to sneak in a run.I'll come with u. Yeah,OK,great,Marn,but I'm warning u, I'm training for a marathon. Five miles OK? Uh,This is so weird. It's like we're twins! I'm actually training for a triathlon,which is a little bit harder, but five miles is perfect. Charlie! Are u ready? Charlie? You all right? Oh,yeah.

I mean,Marn, how can we not talk about this,right? Right! Because she's not just marrying u,Will,she's marrying all of us. We all have to put up with her. But I couldn't do it unless I knew I had ur support on this thing. In that case,Will,William Cramp! I know what u're about to say, and it means the world to me that u'd actually open up ur heart and bring her into our family like that. Seriously. What's going on,kids? I thought we were training for a marathon. Charlie! Hey,u cool with this pace,Marni? Yeah! You sure? Oh,yeah. It's good. In that case, what do u say we sprint to the end! Let's do it. Yeah? Let's go!

One of those babies, she'll be able to taste sunlight. Ew,gross! Go get me my rag bag. Marni,what happened to u? Uh,I took a shortcut. Through a woodchipper? No,through an ant bed. I knew we shouldn't have left her. Charlie.u're here. I'm here,actually. Blurred vision. That can't be good. No. Ants carried away her contacts. What kind of ants were they? I forgot to ask them, but I will next time.really,this is not a big deal,u guys.I'm fine. She's not. The bad news is she hurt her leg. The good news is she can't feel it 'cause of the ant bites. Mom,stop being so dramatic. It's not That did not sound good. Uh,u know what? That was completely my fault. I shouldn't have been standing here. I'm sorry. I can take care of these No,no,no,no OK, I'm actually gonna get u to a safety zone. That looked like it hurts. You guys will not believe what just happened. I think my So itchy everywhere!

Well,I can't get ur contacts until tomorrow morning. I thought u'd like to see. Look at them,Mom! They look like pimples! And my bangs? It's literally like nothing has changed since high school. Marni,I know. But they're just ant bites, and they will go away. And,before u know it,everything's gonna be fine, and u're gonna live happily ever after. "Happily ever after" is in fairy tales,Mom. High school was a horror movie.This weekend is the sequel. It's times like this that I like to then go back Mom,do u always have to offer up some sweet little perfect nugget of self-help advice? Because I'm just really not in the mood. Well,someday u're gonna appreciate my wisdom. Marni,being a mom is hard. There is no rule book. Every day,u wake up and hope u have to trust ur instincts and hope u're not messing up ur kids. It's a lot of pressure. And I feel a profound sense of responsibility that that everything I do greatly affects u and ur brothers' lives. And that's why I want u to know that what I'm about to do is deeply, deeply wrong! Mom,what are u doing? Oh,u know I hate being late! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Whoo-hoo! Bonjour,guten tag,hola,aloha,konichiwa! Hi,y'all. Welcome to Joanna's bridal shower. Now,listen,ladies.

I have something I need to tell uI haven't Sure I haven't been totally honest Is there anyone else who would like to make a toast? Tim does! Oh, no. OK. Joanna, congratulations on a very special evening. I just wanted to say tonight is an amazing occasion, and it's special for many reasons. One of them being that Joanna and I finally get to share a rehearsal dinner together. Of course,I would rather it had been our rehearsal dinner, but beggars can't be choosers But in all seriousness, uh Joanna, after many, many, many, many hours of therapy I know now why u didn't show up that night. The two of u were engaged? And I even know that it's my fault. It was right after collegeI was ung and immature. That's OK. I missed u, Joanna. I miss ur voice, I miss the God, she used to make this sound when we would when we would snuggle. Remind me to change my phone number. I got cold feet He wigged out! How could u not tell me this? I'm sorry. I'd like to dedicate a song to u. This was our song. Overnight scenes Dinner and wine Saturday girls I was never in love Never had the time In my hustle and hurry world Laughing myself to sleep Waking up lonely I needed someone to hold me, Joanna Girl, u're every woman in the world to me u're my fantasy u're my reality Girl, u're every woman in the world to me u're everything I see u're everything to me Oh, yeah. Thanks, Tim for that. now we have a special video for Joanna from the bridal party. A video? Did u know about this? Engaged, Joanna? To that guy? OK, I'm ready. Hi, I'm JJ Clark and I'm a senior at Ridgefield High. We're supposed to tell all u losers what life is like in 2002 so u can see how much things have changed. How did they find this? Wanna know what life's like for an 18-year-old in high school? Life is easy. This was for the time capsule. They said no one would see it for 50 years. I mean, sure u gotta work at it to be number one. But high school's not brain surgery It's more like prison. And, in this prison, I'm the warden. So it's myjob to keep all the inmates in line. Oh, look, here's one now. In high school, only the strong survive. The meek shall not inherit the earth. Moo! High school's a four-year sentence. They don't let u out early for good behavior. So, take it from me, it's better to be bad. Out of my way! Will I'm so sorry. I was a stupid kid, and u know that's not who I am anymore. No See, I don't think I know who anyone is anymore, Joanna. So I'm just gonna get some air here. Wait! Wait, don't Where are u going? Will? Still no answer? What a mess Maybe we should head home,see if Will's there. OK Come on, Bunny. Ben, let's get the car. Let's go. Oh, wait Miss, don't forget ur video. ur video? What I'm sorry. I just wanted Will to know the truthI was trying to protect him. Mom, I know u said to put it behind me, but I guess I just couldn't. I'll get the car I'll go see if I can find Will. Oh, Marni, what have u done? We'll talk about this at home. OK. Just go away! OK? Look, I didn't intend for that to be u have got a lot of nerve u know that? I'm sorry, I've got a lot of nerve? Because u're the one who came in here pretending like nothing had ever happened. Pretending like we didn't even know each other. And Tim? How did u know about that? I didn't know Tim was a freak None of us did. Please That's why u invited him. But that video? Now, that was genius. u know I really underestimated u. I thought we could start over, but no. u were so completely stuck in the past that u just couldn't let it go, could u? Hey, I wanted a real apology, and I deserved one. It was high school u don't get to belittle this. Do u have any idea what all those years of torment did to me? Every day after school, I came home feeling horrible about myself thanks to u. u can'tjust ruin someone's life and pretend like it didn't happen. u just ruined my life! Do u get that? The fact that u're standing here right now, asking me to feel sorry for u, is priceless. Oh, I'm sorry Are u walking away from me? Nice work Like mother, like daughter? Excuse me? ur daughterjust ruined what should have been the happiest night of Joanna's life. Just broke her heart, just like that. Sound familiar? Did u see the video? I did Nice timing, too, at the rehearsal dinner. Did u? I'm not doing this in here Fine with meLet's go. Marni! Are u insane? What do u think? I think my brother was smart to get out when he did. Oh, kitty likes to scratch. Well, two can play at this game. Warm-up. Just gettin' loose Yeah? Presents! Oh, don't u just love this? Marni, let's just not do that. No, no, no! Marni, please don't! That was a wedding giftIt cost a fortune! Don't Don't do it Just Marni? One less thank-u note to send. u are so gonna regret that. I always wished I was strong enough to stand up to u. But u know what I finally realized today? I don't need to stand up to u. It's not worth itu're a liar, and u're a phony. My family's better offwithout u. Will is better offwithout u. I'm done with u My feet hurt. Yeah! Stop it! What are u doing, Joanna? I came back in here to see if u were OK I was concerned about u I was worried about u, but from the looks of it, I would say that u are more than capable of taking care of urself. I just can't believe that I fell for that. That whole Meals on Wheels, Mother Teresa act. u are so good, I'm so stupid because I fully believed u! I thought I knew exactly who u were Do u know that? u do know who I am, Will! u do! Yes, Joanna, I do know who u are. u're a bullyu're a liaru are An emotional terrorist! u stay out of this, Marni! Do u know that u are just as much to blame? No, Will, I needed to No No! Stop talking to me! Going behind my back, helping to orchestrate this thing, how could u do that to me? How could u do that to me? What is wrong with both of u? I'm sorry, WillI'm sorryI never meant to hurt u. I wanted to tell u the truth about who I was back thenI swear. u don't get it, do u? No, u don't get it. u still don't get itNo, because I don't care who u were in high school. I don't care that u were engaged I don't care about anything! I care that u lied to me about it! u lied to me! u lied to me And who was I supposed to be marrying tomorrow? Now, who is that?Is that the girl that I sang karaoke with on the beach? 'Cause I liked that girlI liked that girl so much. Or the warden of Ridgefield High School? Wait! Will, please don't! Please! Wait! u have been playing me since the moment yu walked in my house. Playing u? Why? What happened between us? Tell me u honestly don't remember? I remember everything! u don't remember that we were best friends, and then all through high school, every single time, I was runner-up to u? Runner-up to me? Ramona, it wasn't a competition Of course it wasn't. u always won I won because they voted for me! Do u remember cheerleading? u made me try out. u got on the squad I got laughed out the door. Oh, come on u were great! Oh, pleaseAnd let's not forget about Grease. u knew how badly I wanted to be Sandy. But no, of course u just had to audition. I always wanted to be in a musical, RamonaAlways. please u don't even sing u were already prom queen. u were already head cheerleader Drama was supposed to be mine. But no, u didn't think about me. All u cared about, when u got to high school, was u. what was I supposed to do,Ramona?Slow down so u could catch up? That's mean Don't push me. Don't u Are u insane? After all that, u stole Richie Phillips from me! Richie Phillips? From high school? I was in love with him! u were in love with him? And u went to the prom with him. He asked me, Ramona! u were my friend. u were supposed to say no! That's when I knew I could never count on u. I promised myself I would never let anyone make me feel the way u did. u know what? I should thank u. If it weren't for u, I wouldn't have worked so hard, and I wouldn't have achieved what I have-. Well, good for u. Oh, come off itIt just makes u crazy that I've that l've done all this and that I look so good. u know what, Ramona? Honestly, I'm proud of u. I am proud of what u've accomplished in ur life. I think u've done amazingly But my family is my accomplishment. So I'm not jealous of uI have a family. They love meI'm happy! happiness isn't everything. OK, I'm outta here. I was jealous u had it all. u were pretty,u were smart,everyone wanted to be ur friend. Just seeing u the other night with all ur family just reminded me of My marriages haven't worked out, and Joanna's all I have. Now, u want to take her away too. And I knew that would happen as soon as I found out that she was marrying ur son. I'm sorry, RamonaHonestly. And I should have been a better friend, obviously. I knew what I was doing. I was so busy being Gail Byer and everything that that meant. I just I was insensitive. I wasn't a good friendAnd I'm sorry. I can't believe I got a makeover because of u. u did? Of course I did! I almost got hair extensions. ur hair flips around, and I was jealous. Oh, I'm so glad. I feel like I can breathe again. Really? I can't breathe! I'm underwater! What is going on out here? I'm very disappointed with the behavior I saw tonight. I don't pretend to have the slightest clue about how things work in the girl world. To be perfectly honest, it frightens and confuses me. But here's what I do know. A wedding is a time for a family to come together. But, for whatever reason, this wedding is tearing our family apart. Willis missing. Ramona's out searching the streets for Joanna. This weekend is a disaster And Ifor one, have had it. u two are completely out of Control. But nothing! u're groundedGo to ur rooms. What is it, Coco Puff? What is it? Oh, no. No Joanna don't do it, Don't Joannaput down the spray cheese. It's not worth it There are so many carbs. Oh, what difference does it make? It's not like I'm getting married anymore. I am an awful person. Hey, remember me? I'm the one who ruined ur rehearsal dinner. Think I'm the awful person Oh, Marni, stopJust .Just stop apologizing. Ugh I deserved it. I deserve all of it! Hey! OK, waitJoanna. Hand that over Give her here. Why don't We share? Hey that's nice Let's seeLooks Ooh, it looks good. That's right, we can share thatLooks good I just spent so many years, so many years trying to distance myself from the person I was. I just wanted to be a person my parents were proud of,u know? I'm sure ur parents would be very proud of u Ye-ah, they would've been proud of me if I would've apologized to u the moment u walked through that door. I just didnt want Will or ur parents to know how awful I was back them. I love them all so much. And it's been such a long time since I've had a real family. I just didnt wanna lose them. I panicked. u panicked? I freaked out. I went all Marni dearest on u guys. u're never gonna lose themThey adore u. u fit into my family better than I do. Oh that's not true. But I think the reason why they love me is because they really miss u. Look Marni, I don't expect u to ever forgive me, but I do want u to know that I am truly sorry. Would u mind Saying that just one more time, just, like, slower or something? I'm sorry, Marni, for being so evil. For For pushing u onto that basketball court. For Oh, gosh, for everything. I really, I I really apologize. Thank u, Joanna. Oh, gosh. I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I really don'tWill won't talk to me. I have made such a mess of things. I've really I can't live without him,Marni. I think,.. everything is gonna turn out just fineTrust me. u got this. WM? Go away. No, Will! Go away! Wait! Would u just wait for a second? Will! My leg! Are u OK? Which leg is it? It's the same leg from the other day! it's my bad leg! Marni, guess what? u hurt ur left leg the other day, but really, good try, Marni Wait, Will, hear me out. Marni, I don't wanna hear u out! I don't wanna hear anything u have to say, OK? u ruined what should have been the best day of my life. Do u understand that? Yes, I doAnd I'm really sorry. I'm really, really sorry, Will. Please try to accept my apology because the last thing that I intended was for u to get hurt. u've just always protected me, and I was trying to protect u "from the girl that I thought Joanna was. But she's not that gm anymore. She's really not. She's a girl who loves u very, very much. And u love her, too, dummy. And that's all that matters I'm really sorry. I guess we'll just have to wait it out, 'cause I told Will the truth. I don't Know what else No! Will and Joanna! They're up in the tree house! Why are u flipping out? That's a good thing. They're probably hugging it out No, I didn't want him to give the tree house to her so I was gonna take it apart and hide it! Where did u suppose u were gonna hide the tree house? Look, the point is, I loosened the bolts, but didn't get a chance to finish. That's not good. Hey, guys! Cam u come down here for a second? We have to talk to u! It's important!
