Do you want pimento loaf or baloney? Hey, Professor! They only got a couple of spots left! Shh. Ours is right over there. - [Laughing] - Carlton. You see, if our experiment is a success... we will have isolated the super sports gene. And then we can sell it to professional athletes all around the world. - Amazing. - Oh, yes, it is. But it can only be done if we have all of Air Bud's puppies as well as the... - Bud. - Now, you must memorize these faces. We have to catch each and every one. This is Buddy's oldest pup, Shooter. And this one, Duke. Here's Buddy's third pup, Zack, an outstanding linebacker. - Backer. - And a puppy who already knows... how to play soccer... Striker. - Striker. - And, of course, the best of them all... their father. - The Bud. - Then, and only then, will I have the ingredients... to create the greatest experiment ever. [Laughing] Hey, Buddy, check this out! All right, Duke! Nice catch! Yeah! What? What? - Nice play. - You better recognize. Defense, defense! Shooter, to you! Yeah, Shooter! Yes! Hut! Zack, go deep! Yes! - Way to go, Striker! - [Barking] Hey, Buddy, come on. Buddy, shoot! [Laughing] - Honey, flames! - It's fine, it's fine! See? - You're killing me here! - [Giggling] Hey, Josh, put me down! [Laughing] [Girl] Shoot! Mama mia! - You gonna have some of that? - So? - Honey, can you get Andrea? - Yeah, sure. Andrea, lunch! I could've done that. Will you and Buddy still baby-sit? - It depends on how busy we are. - We might have a lot of homework. You're gonna be in high school? Junior high. Yeah. Junior high, here we come. - [Mother] Andrea! - I gotta go. I don't think we should be doing this anymore. It's kind of elementary. Yeah, you're probably right. Well, see ya later. See ya. - Want some juice? - You want some of that too? - Guess what. Tom and I are in two of the same classes. - Oh, great! - Don't let him distract you. - Don't worry. Why don't you go see your brother? Tammy and I are in four of the same classes. I think we have that same history teacher you guys used to make fun of. Buzzoo! Who wants a busy bee? - The one you said looked like a gopher. - Pass me one of those ribs. Who wants a busy bee? Who wants a busy bee? Leftovers! [Barking] Okay. [Yelling] Need any help? Nope. Pretty much all packed up. - Think you're gonna miss it here? - Yeah, sure. But, you know, it doesn't mean I'm gone forever, right? So, are you gonna come and visit? Yeah, I think I might sneak back for a day in the summer. I'm just kidding. I'll be back at Thanksgiving. I was thinking maybe you could take my room while I'm gone, make sure nobody messes it up. But it's your room. So, you could borrow it, right? Nah, I'd rather have it stay just the way it is. Good night, Josh. 'Night, Andrea. I'm really going to miss you. - Sure you got everything? - Yeah. I got it. There. Let's go, Buddy. Okay then, I guess it's time. Where's Andrea? I don't know. She was here a minute ago. - Why don't I go find her? - I'll get Noah ready. Where's your sister? Andrea! Andrea? [Mother] Andrea! We've gotta go! Andrea! If we don't leave now, we're gonna miss the bus. - Let's go. - Hey. Buddy, can you find Andrea for me? Go find her. [Barking] Buddy, stop! Leave me alone. [Barking] Buddy, where are we going? Hey, it's Josh. Josh! How's it goin'? Ahh, good to see ya. - Tom, you look ready. - I've been ready all summer. [Chuckling] Josh, they're boarding. I'll go say good-bye to my folks... and then I'll grab us some front-row seats. - All right. We'll see ya. I'll be there in a minute. - I'll put these on the bus. All right, son. Go where you must go. Oh, baby! [Sobbing] Oh, oh, give me one more. - Guess it's time. - Yeah. Guess you're gonna have to say bye to Andrea and Buddy for me. I will. I will. Don't worry, Mom, okay? I'm gonna be fine. I know you will. I love you. I love you too. Oh, bye. Okay. Bye. - Want a sandwich? - No. Thank you. There he is. [Humming] [Barking] - That's it, Buddy! That's his bus! - [Barking] [Barks] Buddy! - Buddy? - [Barks] - Josh! - Andrea? What's wrong? Nothing. I mean... I didn't get to say good-bye. I don't want you to go, Josh. I know, Andrea, but listen to me, okay? It's just time. All right? Just like it's time for you to go to junior high. Yeah, I know. Are you gonna come out and visit me? Okay. Here, I, uh... I want you to have this. That's Dad's watch! I know, but... you just keep it for me till I get back. Hey. - I'll miss you, okay? - Yeah. You and Buddy can look after each other. You look after Andrea for me, okay? [Sighs] See ya, Bud. Okay. Now I really do have to go, so here. - I love you. - I love you too, Josh. [Bus Driver] That's it, folks. Get back to your seats, please. [Sighs] I love that dog. Come on, Buddy. [Chuckling] You little... Will you stop fooling around? I thought I told you to go buy us a car. What are you looking at? Sweet! [Gasps] Ta-da! Carlton! You don't like it? [Barking] Okay, okay, I'm up! I'm up! [Giggles] Mom, how's this? Honey, that looks great. Do you want some toast? - How 'bout this one? - Honey, that looks good too. Don't forget your lunch. Thanks. I'm so nervous. - Need a ride? - Oh, no. Tammy and I are gonna walk together. - [Doorbell Rings] - Oh, that's her. Gotta go. Did you change? [Father] It looks nice! - Hey. - Hey. Well, here goes. [Tammy] I hope everything goes okay. Yeah. - Look at you go. - Okay, I'm... Gotta go. - Have a good day, honey. - I have two appointments, but I'll call you. Who's gonna come with me? Who's gonna come with me? - Hey, Buddy, b... - [Harmonica] Hey, Buddy! Why don't you come show us some moves? Do we have homeroom first thing? Thanks, Zack. Hey, Buddy. - Jeez, they look so old. - They are. Ready? Here goes. [Barking] Andrea, Buddy's here! Oh, my bag! Thanks, Buddy. - See ya. - That was lucky. Yeah. - Which way do we go? - I don't know! There's so many people. [School Bell Rings] [Clears Throat] Ladies, shouldn't you two be headed to class now? - We were just heading there. - Yeah. - Where do we go? - I think it's this way. Here it is! Here! We're late, and it's Mrs. Crippin. [Andrea] Josh says they call her "The Crippler." Ladies. [Girl] They're in so much trouble. Well, now that we have been so rudely interrupted... let me remind all of you that tardiness... will not be accepted in my classroom, no excuses. As I was saying, mathematics is fun. [Singing] Stop! There, that's him. Striker. - Shall we prepare? - Wait. It's the sheriff. Ohh! We'll have to come back. Drive, Carlton. Will you drive? [Engine Revs] [School Bell Rings] [All Chattering] - Which class did you have before this? - Science. [Chattering, Laughing Continue] Hey, there's Buddy! - Hey, Buddy! - Let him in! [Mother] Who's a hungry boy? All right! Hey, how's that look? Honey, that's beautiful! So, did you meet anyone new at school today? - Ah, sort of. - Sort oF? It's just your first day. You've got to give yourself a chance. Yeah, I know. Josh called today. He said things are going really well. He said to say hello. What's the matter? He said he offered you his room, but you didn't want to take it. - Yeah, I'd rather just have mine. - Really? - You sure? - Yeah. What's the matter? Aww. - 'Cause he can't have any beef. - Can I be excused? I'm not really hungry. [Crying] We gotta do something. Yeah, you're right. - Do we always have to wear these? - I hope not. Okay, Anderson, Framm and O'Reilly, you're up next. And begin. And begin. - So, how'd I do? - Really good. [Orchestra] [Cymbals Clang] Andrea? - The cookies! - Oh, my gosh! - Tammy, what happened? - I swear it said 350 minutes. - Fire! - [Coughing] Oh, tough day, girls? - That's it. Baseball. - What's it? Baseball? What do we know about baseball? It's easy. I'll teach you. - Oh, brother. - Coach? - Yeah? - I was wondering if we could try out... - for the baseball team? - Sure, why not? Tryouts are tomorrow at 3:30. Hey, good luck. Thanks. Tryouts are tomorrow at 3:30. I don't know how to play baseball. There's always home ec. - [Barks] - Hi, honey. How was school? - Fine... I guess. - Oh, good. If you don't count the explosion and the fire in home ec. - Yeah, everything was great. - That sounds great, honey. Oh, here comes your pants. It's okay. It's just storage. - What are you eating? - I'm gonna be fine. - [Mother] What are you eating? - I just got a fingerful. I'll still be hungry. You are home. Yeah, um, I was wondering if anybody would have any time... - [Pager Beeping] - Emergency. The Samuelson's horse is about to foal. I'm sorry, honey. I gotta go. Time to throw the ball? Oh, shoot! Your soup! Oh! He could use a diaper change. Would you mind, honey? I can get your soup. Okay. I knew it. You want the ball? Here you go. Thanks, Buddy. Make sure you cover him. He likes to go. Thanks, Mom. [Phone Ringing] Mom? [Phone Ringing] Hello? Hi, Tammy. Yeah, did you say practices would be every day after school? Yeah, I'll be there. Yeah, see ya. How did you get so wet? [Mother] Did you see that? All right, kids, I'm Coach Crenshaw... and you can, uh... You can just call me Coach. First things first. Who all here has played ball before? I played catcher before with my brother and his friends. Never on a team or anything. I heard there's still an audition for dancers in the school play. [Boys Laughing] We're gonna warm up with a few drills, and, Randy, you're gonna lead them. Let's go, guys. All right, let's go. I almost got it! This is a long one. I think we've warmed up enough. Tammy, get in front of it. Nice! Andrea, this one's for you. Get in front of it. Nice snag, Tammy. Put your body behind it. Get in front of it, Terrance. That's it. Keep your eyes open, Andrea. Use your mitt. Get your body behind it. Charge at the ball. Get in front of it. We'll work on it. Nice, Tammy. Get under it! Maybe the next one. All right, everyone, let's scrimmage. [Chuckles] [Whispers] Ow. - [Chuckles] - [Barking] Andrea Framm, you're up. C'mon, Andrea! You can do it! Keep your eye on the ball. Follow through the zone. [Boy] Come on, Randy! - She's gonna kill someone with that thing! - All righty then. Okay, one more batter, and we'll call it a day. [All Chattering] That's practice! Tammy? - Come on in. - [Boy] Randy got beat by a girl. Your swing could come in very handy this year. So I made the team? I'll post the roster tomorrow. Coach? What about Andrea? We joined together. She's my best friend. B.F. F... best friends forever. If she can't play, I won't be able to join. We made a pact to stick together. You have to wait until tomorrow. Excuse me. Sorry. Yeah! First practice, today after school. D-D-D-D-D-D! Ball, ball, ball! Yeah, Shooter, man! That was a wicked shot. You're gettin'better every day. Yo, man, give me some paw. - Shooter, I made the baseball team! - [Barking] Nice work, Andrea. Hey, you guys! Anybody home? Hello? - I made the base... - Shh! He's asleep. [Crying] [Andrea] Sorry. I made the team. Come on, Buddy. Wait. Watch it! Watch Shooter! Are you all ready? Let him loose. There you go, Rocky. [Barks] Come on, Rocky! Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes. [Chuckling] Huh? Go. Ball, ball, ball! Hold up, man. Where's Shooter? I don't know. He took a doggie time-out or something. Shooter! Just remember, we are not the bad guys. We are the scientists. - We are... good guys. - Good. Science is good. - [Barking] - Science is good, yes. - Shooter? - C'mon, boy, where are ya? Shooter! Wait tillJosh finds out. He won't believe it. - Hey! - Hello, Andrea. How are you doing? Great! I made the... Whoops! - Baseball team. - See you at the ballpark. Sheriff? Sheriff. Hmm? What's up? I'm sorry to interrupt, Sheriff, but my Shooter's gone missing. You got a permit for that gun, son? N-No. My Shooter. - Your rifle? - No, my dog. Your dog. What's his name? Shooter! O'er the land of the free And the home of the [Sour Note] Brave Good afternoon, Fernfield. This is Mailman Phil... broadcasting live on Fernfield community radio... bringing you the Timberwolves' first game of the season. Okay, you guys, you all know your positions. So let's get out there... and show them a little Timberwolf teeth! A little Timberwolf teeth! Come on, you guys! [Together] One, two, three... Timberwolves! Come on, guys! Here we go. [Humming: "Take Me Out To The Ball Game"] Next leg. Before we start the game, I'd like to remind everyone that Shooter is missing. And all the basketball players would appreciate it, that if you see him... to please give them a holler. Play ball! Come on, guys, we can do it! I'm right behind you all! Whoo! Got it. - [Cheering] - Yeah! Awesome catch, Tammy! Awesome catch! Come on, Tammy! Yeah! Yes! Safe! I gotta tell ya, folks, Tammy is solidifying herself... as Fernfield's best player as she leads... the Timberwolves to another victory! I should've got an automatic. Strike three! You're outta here! Yes! Yoo-hoo! Hi, Buddy. Got it! Here you go. Shooter's missing? Buddy? We got a real nail-biter here, folks. We're in the bottom of the ninth. Tammy's up to bat. She's the best hitter. Here she goes. There's a long drive out to right center field. It's back. Back. It's gone! It's a home run! - Ah-ooga! - [Cheering] Tammy has won the game for the Timberwolves. And another great victory for Fernfield. Andrea! Andrea, wait up! If you practice enough, I know Coach will give you a chance. Tammy, I don't even belong on this team. Coach made a mistake even letting me join in the first place. - Andrea? - I gotta go. We've got another exciting game on our hands, folks. It's the bottom of the ninth and our feisty Timberwolves are tied up... with the defending champion Baboons at three runs apiece. - Strike two! - [Barks] No. [Groans] Tammy! - Tammy took that right off the elbow. - Oh, no. Oh. - Oh, no, not Tammy! - Okay, guys, get back. - Ow. - Oh, that's a doozy. I can't move it. You'll have to get it x-rayed. Come on, honey. Mike, get the gear on. Andrea, go take right field. This is bad news, folks. It doesn't look like Tammy's gonna be able to continue. She's gonna have to leave the game. It's all right. Tammy's in good hands. Andrea Framm is gonna see her first action of the season. [Man] Do it, Andrea. Good teamwork, guys. Strike one! Strike two! Got it! No, no! Andrea! Andrea, no! [Crowd Groans] Safe! That's the game! That's the game. Sorry. "Sorry"? That just cost us the game. Way to go. We're gonna make her feel so good when she comes here, okay? Hey, sweetie! For your first game, it sure was close. We would've won if it wasn't for me. It was your first time playing. You've gotta give yourself a chance. Tell that to the team. Well, maybe I could help you practice a little. Even you think I suck. Hey, honey. So, how did it go? Ow. [Singing] Still no sign of Shooter, huh? Don't worry about it. Because tomorrow we're gonna have another look. Holy Italian hairdo. I almost forgot the special shampoo for Senora Fusilli. Get him off me. Get him off me! Come on! Come on, Rocky! In the car! Car, car, car! [Barking] [Chuckling] Gotcha! ♪ Que bella... ♪ [Speaking Italian] Striker! Now, where do you go, my boy? - Good work, Carlton. - Thank you. - Good work, Professor. - Shut up. Striker! [Speaking Italian] Striker! - Hey. - Hey. Is it broken? No. Just badly bruised. Then I guess you won't be able to play. Or help you practice. Yeah. - [Buddy Whimpers] - Tammy? Dinner! - I gotta go. - Yeah, I'll see ya. - I hope you feel better. - Thanks. Strike one! Strike two! Come on, Andrea! Keep your eye on the ball! Strike three! - Good try, sweetie! - Good swing. Hey, Buddy. No sign of Shooter yet, huh? You be careful, okay? Keep the faith, Buddy. We'll find him. She's got it! She's got it! Things are looking pretty bleak for the Timberwolves. They've lost the last three games in a row... and their star player, Tammy, is still out with an injury. [Whimpering] [Whimpers] Throw the keys. [Laughing] We got a doggie Zack? Zack, where'd you go? [Randy] You practically forced Coach Crenshaw to put Andrea on the team. - What was I supposed to do? She's my best friend. - I don't know. It's not like I meant for us to lose the season. Oh, no. I gotta go. Andrea? Andrea, wait up! Andrea! I wish Josh was here. He'd know how to help me. [Whimpers] [Barks] All right, Buddy. I'll come.

Well, we have got one out at the top of the ninth. The Timberwolves are clinging to a one-run lead over the Tigers. Let's go, Timberwolves! [Father] We got it. Come on. Strike two! Folks, I don't think Randy's got much gas left in his old arm. Strike 'im out, Randy! Blitz two! Play it to two! - Safe! - [Cheering] - I think we might see a pitching change here. - Time. Time! Randy, you're done. - What? The arm's fine! - Gimme the ball. I'm not risking your arm. Now, we're down one player, so we're gonna have to go with two fielders. Excuse me. Coach? Coach, is it too late in the season for a new player to join the team? Well, no, but-but... Who do you have in mind? [Whistles] [Girl] It's Buddy! Well, I'll be. It's Buddy! Look, they're putting Air Bud in! Buddy? When did that happen? - This is certainly a strange turn of events. - You gotta be kidding me. Andrea Framm is coming in to pitch and Buddy's put on a Timberwolves outfit. He's coming in to play first base. Ah, yeah! - This game's going to the dogs. - Yeah, Andrea! She's gonna pitch? [Barking] Let's play ball! - All right, Andrea! - Let's go! - My ball! - Yeah! - You're outta there! - [Laughing] - Good job! - [Child] All right, Andrea! - [Barking] - [Child] You rule, Buddy! - Strike one! - [Crowd Cheers] [Tammy] Pitch it to him hard, Andrea! Strike two! No balls! Two strikes! [Child's Voice] Oh, hello, hello. [Kissing Sounds] Yeah, Terrance! - [Tammy] Yes! - Go, go, go! - Way to go, boy! - Yeah, Buddy! - [Barking] And that's the game! The Timberwolves win four to three. And Andrea Framm got the final two outs to wrap things up pretty good. - Outta there! - [Barking] - Good shot! - [Giggles] The next batter for the Timberwolves is Buddy Framm. Go, Buddy! Whoo! Go, Buddy! Whoo! Go, Buddy! Whoo! Yeah, Buddy! [Woman] They know what you're doing. - Safe! - [Laughing, Cheering] Whoo! I got it! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah, run! Strike three! How do you like that, folks? The Timberwolves win again. Now they're going to face the defending champion Baboons in the league final. [Man] Hey, gang, free hot dogs! Oh, I'm so hungry! - How was baseball? - Fine. I guess. You saw the baby's room? You mean, Josh's. Honey, we're gonna build a new room above the garage forJosh. Then the baby can be closer to us and his big sis. - But, Mom... - Honey, you said you didn't want his room. I know. I didn't wantJosh's room because I just wanted it to stay the same. Oh. Honey, I want you to understand something. Just because we're changing Josh's room, doesn't mean... we're getting rid ofJosh. And just because we have a new member in this family... doesn't mean that he or you... anytime ever, will be replaced. - It feels like it. - Oh. We have been so busy with Noah lately. I'm sorry if you felt left out. I should've talked to you about it sooner. I miss Josh. Honey, I know you do. So do I. [Whimpers] [Sighs] Okay, Buddy, let's go. [Gasps] Oh, no, Josh's watch! [Professor] There he is. It's gotta be here. Where is it? Andrea. [Chittering] What are you doing here? Your mom. She said I'd find you here. - I came to... - I don't need your help. You've helped me enough. Did you think you were helping me when you had to talk to the coach to get me on the team? Sorry. I should have talked to you first. Yeah, you should've! And if I had known... Well, I don't know exactly what. But... I only did it so we could play together. We do everything together. I didn't wanna play if you weren't gonna be on the team. - And that's exactly what I told Coach. - Oh. There's Rocky. - [Chittering] - [Barks] [Together] Rocky! - [Buddy Barking] - Buddy? Buddy! Buddy! - We have got to hurry! - Buddy! Buddy! - Hey, that's my dog! - Hurry up, get in the car! Quick! Hurry up! - Buddy! - Quick, get your bike! Go, Carlton, go! They're chasing us! - Faster! Faster! - I'm going as fast as I can. [Professor] Move! - [Tires Screeching] - Pedal faster, Andrea! Come on, Tammy. We're gaining on 'em! Quick! They're after us! Faster! - I'm going as fast as I can. Don't. - Stop. Get him outta the way. [Horn Honking] [Both Screaming] Mommy! Whoo-ooo-ooo! - [Barking] - Okay? - [Andrea] Buddy! - Beautiful. [Whistles] - Stop! That's my dog! - Oh, Sheriff! - Keep your eyes on the road! - I am keeping my eyes on the road. [Siren Wailing] This way! [Tammy] Come on. I think we lost 'em. [Chuckles] We've done it, Carlton. We have them all. [Chuckling] That's them! Hurry, after 'em! - Good work, Carlton. - Thank you, boss. [Chuckling] Andrea, go! Dad-gum, where the heck are they? [Professor Chuckling] [Laughing Continues] - [Barking] - [Laughing] [Muttering] - Hey, Rocky. - He stinks! [Spitting] - Watch the road! - [Screaming] Buddy! Hey there, baseball fans! Welcome to the championship game between the Baboons... and your own Fernfield Timberwolves! [Grunting] Good news for the Timberwolves. Tammy Slayton will start today's game back from the injured list. I didn't see Andrea, Tammy or Buddy anywhere. They should be here by now. Coach, I need a batter. Well, I've got three of my players still missing. Yeah, I'm sorry, Coach. We're gonna have to start without 'em. Let's... play ball! There ya go. Oh, no! It looks like the Timberwolves... are missing their three best players... Andrea, Tammy and Buddy. [Muffled Sounds] Batter up! Oh, this is terrible news for Fernfield. They'll have to start the game with not a full roster. What will we do if they don't show up? [Sighs] Well, I'm afraid, Terrance... we're just gonna have to do the best we can with whatever team we've got. Come on, this way. They're sneakin' around. Oh, I bet they're all in there. [Barking] Oh, you stupid... Let go of him. Well, folks, it looks like the Baboons'pitcher has brought his "A" game to the ballpark. Strike three! [Echo] Three! Three! He is throwing some serious heat out there. Excuse me. Did you find her? No, I haven't. I called Tammy's house. Nobody's home. - She knew when the game started. I can't imagine she'd forget. - I know. [Terrance] My ball! Safe! And he's safe at the plate. The Baboons are quickly on board, one to nothing. [Cackling] [Chitters] [Barking] Well, let's go. [Chittering] [Barking] - [Barks] - Buddy. - Buddy. - [Barks] Table. - [Barks] - Hurry. - Did you hear something? - Shh! Josh's watch. Thanks, Buddy. I gotta get you outta here. [Whispering] Hurry, Andrea. [Barking] - Shh! Quiet! - [Barking] [Andrea] Come on, guys, hurry! [Gasps, Gulps] Professor! Go... after them! [Professor] Get in the car! [Barking] Go, go, go! No! Stop, stop, stop! Idiot! Go! Now go! Go! Randy's got himself in a bind here, folks. The bases are loaded and the Baboons' cleanup hitter is at the dish. [Man] Come on now. And there's a line shot up the middle that's going right to the fence, folks. Two runs are gonna score for sure. Here comes the relay from center field. Oh, it's not even close. S-Safe! That's three runs. And the Baboons now lead four to nothing. I tell ya, Randy's losing it out there. And still Andrea, Tammy and Buddy are nowhere to be seen. We're losing them. Faster, faster! Hurry! [Siren Wailing] Eh. Oh, darn. All right, come out of there, you varmints! What the heck? Where do you think you're goin'? - What-What do you... - [Chittering] Okay. I hope you don't get carsick. Back at the ballpark, and the Timberwolves... are really struggling with this tough Baboon team. - Run it out, baby! Run it out! - Safe! Oh! - Baboons'big slugger steps up to the plate. - [Kid] Hit it over the fence. Here's the pitch! Swing! It's a long hit to left! It's, it's outta here! Two more runs scored. That's six to one for the Baboons. Things are looking hopeless for Fernfield. Randy's arm is shot. There's no relief on the bench. And worst of all... we're still missing Andrea, Tammy and Buddy from the field. They're gaining on us! Quick. We've got them! We've got them now! [Laughing] - Hurry up, Tammy! - I'm a-goin'. - Wait. Where's the net? - Oh, I'll get it. No! What are you doing, you idiot? - Get that... I can't see! - Professor! My eyes! Get it off of me! [Squealing] Get it off me, Carlton! [Barking] - Professor! - What? Whoa. Whoa! - [Squealing] - [Grunts] Oh, no, the game! Come on! Strike three! You're outta here! He strikes him out again. The Fernfield Timberwolves go out in order again... and the Baboons keep rolling along. [Siren Wailing] Ahh... yuck! Carlton! - Sorry. - You're sorry? - You're sorry?

[Laughing] Nice goin', boys. Y'all sure look cute out there. [Laughing] Give it to me! Hmph. [Groans] [Laughing] [Squealing] [Barking] Strike... three! Swing and a miss. She struck him out. That's Terrance's third whiff on the afternoon. [Man] Hurry! Come look at the dogs! - [Tammy] I hope we're not too late. - Don't worry, we'll make it. [Crowd] Take me out to the ball game Take me out to the show Buy me some peanuts and CrackerJacks ♪ I don't care if I ever get back ♪ 'Cause it's root, root root for the home team - There's Andrea and Tammy! - And Buddy and the pups! - Hey, there's Buddy! - [Barking] - Zack! - Shooter? - Striker! - Duke!

[Barking] [Mr. Fusilli] Let's go, Timberwolves! The Timberwolves look like they have new energy with Andrea and Buddy back. But could it be too little, too late? We'll have to see, because the Baboons have a seven to one commanding lead... here in the top of the seventh. There's a sharp ground ball to Terrance. He's up and over to first. - You're outta there! - [Cheering] Great arm, Andrea! [Child] You rule, Buddy! Here's the pitch from Andrea. It's a towering fly ball way over top of home plate. - Yeah! Good job! - [Barking] Mmm, yeah. And here's the pitch on the way from Andrea. Pop fly to left. Easy out. Nice work by Framm. She shut down the Baboons at the top of the seventh. Now the Timberwolves are gonna have to... get a rally going if they wanna come back and win this game. - That's a solid line drive base hit up the middle. - Good job. Andrea takes a lead off first base. She might be thinking of stealing. And there she goes! Look at her go! Run, Andrea, run! Safe! That's some real heads-up base running by Andrea... as she moves into scoring position. She's got this Timberwolves team all fired up. - [Player] That was great, Andrea! - Here's the pitch. Ground ball right to the second baseman. Andrea's caught in a run-down. Over to the third baseman. Oh, she's a dead duck. Uh-oh! - Andrea's safe at third. - [Cheering] Safe! - [Cheering] - [Shouting] [Howling] At the end of the seventh inning... the Timberwolves have narrowed the Baboons' lead to five runs. That's a hard hit ball to Terrance. He's up with it cleanly. Over to first. And it's Buddy with the out! [Cheering] There's a swing and a hard liner to left field for a base hit. - Whoo! - All right! And another shot to left field! - Go, Terrance! - Here comes Terrance. He's gonna try to score. - Safe! - Yeah! Whoo-hoo! At the end of eight innings, the Baboons lead the Timberwolves seven to three. A hard-hit ball to left field. Saf... Outta there! - And the pitch from Andrea. - You got it, Buddy! - Oh, what a great catch by Buddy! - Andrea! - Way to go, Buddy! - Well, despite Andrea's solid pitching performance... it's still not looking too good for Fernfield. They're down by four heading into the ninth. They're gonna need a miracle if they're gonna win this championship. All right, now, we've all been here before. You all know what to do. And I just wanna tell you guys it's really been my honor coaching you this year. All right? So, all in. One, two, three... Timberwolves! Hey, Mom. - Honey! Hi! - How's it goin'? Oh, my gosh! - How's it going? - I didn't know you were gonna drive up. - I didn't know you were coming. You just... - Snuck in. - Did you come to surprise your sister? - Yeah, I just came. - Oh! You're so big! - See, it's your brother. It's no balls and one strike to Terrance. Here's the pitch. Strike two! Strike three! You're outta here! The Baboons are only two outs away from winning another league title. Let's go! Oh, the Timberwolves are down to their final out. It looks like the Baboons are gonna win their third straight league championship. The next batter for the Timberwolves is Buddy Framm. It's okay, guys. I can handle Buddy. [Man] Ahh, Buddy! There's a swing and a hot ground ball to the shortstop. He's up with it. Buddy's got his jets on. - Safe! - Whoo! That's what I call dogged determination. Buddy's on first, and the Timberwolves are still alive. Buddy's gonna try for second! - And he's there! - Way to go, Buddy! There's a ground ball to the right side of the infield for a base hit. Buddy, home! It looks like Buddy's gonna try to score! Slide, slide, slide! - Safe! - Whoo! Good slide! Good slide! The lead is down to three. Now Tammy is up for the Timberwolves. Let's see if she can keep this rally goin'. Here's the pitch. Strike one! Wait a minute, folks. Tammy is switching to bat left-handed. You don't see that very often. Let's see how the Baboon pitcher reacts. Swing and a hard ball to left! Way to go, Tammy! Yeah! [Crowd Cheering] Now Randy's up. Let's see what he can do. Swing, and it's a long drive to right field. The ball is going way back to the fence. - Safe! - He's safe! Well, baseball fans, it doesn't get any more exciting than this. The Timberwolves are down by one run. Bottom of the ninth. Two out. Andrea Framm represents the winning run. You could cut the tension in this ballpark with a knife. You can do it, Andrea. [Whispering] Out of the park. Josh! Good luck. What a pressure situation for Andrea. It's all up to her now. Here's the pitch. Ooh! Andrea took a big cut on that one. Strike one! - It's okay, honey. - Wait for it. Keep your eye on the ball. Follow it through the zone. Strike two! She's down to her last strike, folks! Time. Time! It's okay. [Barking] And there's a long drive back to right field! Run! It's going back, back, back, back! Run, Andrea, run! Safe! [Cheering] Fernfield wins! Fernfield wins! Fernfield wins! Fernfield wins! [Laughing] [Crowd Chanting] Andrea! Andrea! [Chanting] Andrea! Andrea! And this just in, folks.

You played so awesome! Let's go. I missed you so much. [Phone Ringing] Hello? You mean Buddy?
