I can't believe the Land Shark let you tap off on your own this time. - I know, right? But hey, at least he's finally giving me the chance to show him I can do more than just file papers. He gave me the Jerome area to scout and compile potential properties for our investors. If all goes well, you're looking at the new Jerome Project Manager. - [Tabitha] Dang, from assistant to manager? My girl's moving up in the world. - Oh yeah. - Jerome, though? Isn't that like a ghost town? I couldn't do ghosts. - That's just a term for the population. It's not actually haunted. And besides, you know I don't believe in that stuff. - I wonder if the house you're in right now is haunted. - Ha ha, you're hilarious. This house is not haunted and it was actually a smoking deal. It's so much bigger than the photos on the website, and it was dirt cheap. - Wow. The universe really was on your side for this trip. Well, show me around. Let me see the new home away from home. - All right, here's the kitchen. - [Tabitha] What's that door over there? - Let's find out. Ooh, we got lots of food. - [Tabitha] How about that one? (knob jiggling) Where they keep the liquor. I wouldn't wanna stay there if I couldn't get to the liquor. What about the rest of the place? - Can we do that tomorrow? I've had a long day, and I'm starving. - [Tabitha] Darn, all right. Well, congratulations on the opportunities, babe. You're gonna crush it this weekend. And I wanna hear about every second of it, so keep me in the loop, all right? - Thank you, and of course you know I will. (haunting music) - What was that? - What was what? - That book shelf behind you just opened. - Good one, Tabs. Nice try. - [Tabitha] I'm not kidding. I know I saw something. That book shelf just opened. - You know I don't believe in ghosts and I'm not gonna let you ruin my stay. See, nothing is open. Anyways, I gotta go. I have an early morning meeting. - [Tabitha] Meeting? - Yeah, with an agent that Landstone wants me to work with, uh, Mr. Bannister. - [Tabitha] Ooh, Bannister. I like the sound of that name. I bet he's cute. - Tabs, it's a business meeting. Calm yourself. - [Tabitha] I'm just playing. I'll let you go now, but before I do, would you rather wake up stuck in a cage or a laboratory? - Tabs, you're a mess. Not another riddle. I really gotta go. - [Tabitha] Come on, just answer. - Well, the cage, I guess. That's better than someone doing experiments on me. - [Tabitha] Not me. I'd rather wake up in the laboratory as the doctor. - Oh, you outsmarted me there. I gotta go. Goodnight. - [Tabitha] Goodnight. (phone beeping) (door creaking) (tense music) (furniture shuffling) (tense music continues) (door creaking) (tense music continues) (door creaking) (tense music continues) (light buzzing) (tense music continues) (wind blowing) - There's no way I'm going down there. (tense music) (door creaking) (intense music) (phone ringing) Hello? This is Gabrielle Reynolds with Landstone Properties. Oh, hi Mr. Bannister. Sure, Owen it is, and you can call me Gabbi. The Palace Restaurant and Saloon in Prescott. Sure, I can meet you there at noon. Yep, sounds great. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks for calling. Okay, bye. (phone beeping) (crickets chirping) (water running) (water running) (light buzzing) (water running) (Gabbi spitting) (ominous music) (ominous music) (birds chirping) You didn't last very long. (upbeat music) (lively music) - Welcome to the Palace Restaurant and Saloon. How can I help? - Thanks, I'm supposed to be meeting an Owen Bannister. Is he seated already? - He's not here yet. - Well, in the meantime, could you point me to the nearest restroom? - Absolutely, it's just around the corner to the left. - Thank you. - You're welcome, enjoy. ♪ Nobody's gonna take what sure is mine ♪ - Oh my gosh. I am so sorry, ma'am. I, I was in a hurry and... no excuse, my fault. I'm sorry. - It's my fault. I should have been watching where I was going. If you could just point me to the lady's room. - Yeah, it's uh, right behind you. - Oh, thank you. ♪ Yeah yeah, yeah yeah ♪ ♪ I sacrifice, I pay the price ♪ ♪ Nobody's gonna take what was mine ♪ - Hi, we have a table ready for you. It's right over here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, it's you. Again, I sorry for being so clumsy before. - Don't worry about it. It was my fault anyways. Let's just pretend it didn't happen and we can start all over again. - Well, in that case, it is a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Reynolds. - I already told you, you can call me Gabbi. - Yes ma'am. - Stop with that ma'am stuff. You're making me feel old. So, how do you know Mr. Landstone? - Oh, you mean Mr. Land Grab. - That's a good one. You know, my friend calls him Land Shark. - Ooh. - [Gabbi] So how do you know him? - Through an old family connection. - Ah, well, don't go tell him about that Land Shark thing, will you? - Mm, mm. (both chuckling) - I'm really looking forward to seeing these properties that you found. - I think you're really gonna like 'em. - I hope so. You know, I've never been here before, so I'm excited about the new territory. - Hi, are you all ready to order? - This is me. (lively rock music) - Wow, cactuses are so much taller than I ever thought. - Now that right there is a Saguaro cactus. Now those are truly magnificent plants, and some of these are actually as old as the town of Prescott itself. Also uh, it's cacti. - Cacti. - Right this way, ma'am--ah! Gabbi, mm. So uh, where are you staying while you're in this fine state? - I'm staying over in Jerome. - Is that right? - [Gabbi] Yeah. - Well that's a big mistake right there. That whole town is haunted. Don't you know? - Why does everyone keep saying that? - Well, because it is. Has anything strange happened to you just yet? - No. I mean, nothing unusual. - That's good to hear. I mean, I've lived around these parts for a long time and I have heard a lot of strange stories about Jerome. You're not staying at the Conner Hotel, are you? - No, why? - Well-- - What's wrong with the Conner Hotel? - Legend has it, about a hundred years ago, a Mrs. Anna Hopkins found out that her husband was cheating on her with the school teacher. Now nobody remembers her name, but Ms. Hopkins confronted the school teacher in the Conner Hotel cafe and threw acid right in her face. - What? - Nobody knows what happened to the school teacher, but word is, to this day, she haunts that place seeking revenge. And that's why it's called the Spirit Room. - Oh my God, that's a terrible story. - Yeah, I know. - That poor woman. Well, thankfully I'm staying at the big nice house right outside of town in Holy Avenue. - Oh, the Hannah House. - Oh, don't tell me you know a story. - Actually, no, no, it's pretty nice. I mean, it's one of the more historical estates. - Hm, okay. - Yeah. Now let me show you how we can develop this land for Landstone Properties. (dramatic music) The sunsets here are just incredible. I mean, that is the real selling point. - I bet. So why would we be getting such a good deal on this? If there's a fire sale, there must be a fire somewhere. - Well, I see now why old Land Grab hired you. Very sharp. Truth is, the owner owes a lot in back taxes, so they'll lose the property if they don't have it under contract in a week. - I think old Land Grab will like this one. - Mm-hm. - Owen, I know we're supposed to tour another property this afternoon, but I just can't go on. Can we start again in the morning? - Sure, I can take you back right now, but I'm booked up all tomorrow morning and I won't have enough time to show you the other two in the afternoon. If you're willing to say one more night, I could show you the last one on Friday morning. - I'm sure I can change my flight. - Great. And I, I'm sorry I didn't warn you to wear more comfortable shoes. - It's not your fault. I should have known better. - Here. - Yeah. - I'll help. - Thanks. - Now are you sure I can't interest you in meeting up with me later tonight for dinner or drinks? - It's a really nice offer, but I'm just gonna have to play it by ear. You know, work trip and all. - Mm sure. Yeah, of course. Well just let me know and if not, I'll see you Friday. - Yes. And thank you for today. I had a really nice time. - You are very welcome. And don't forget, comfortable shoes on Friday. (lock whirring) (lock whirring) (tense music) - Where'd you--? Interesting management to come in while it's rented. (haunting music) "Welcome to Hannah House." "We're so pleased you decided to book with us." "We hope you have an enjoyable and refreshing stay." (haunting music) (ominous music) What the? (tense music) (phone ringing) Mr. Landstone, hello. - How's it going, Reynolds? - Okay, so far the properties have been great- - Bannister treating you okay? How the properties look? - Mr. Bannister's been very nice. The property has potential. - Go through the town yet, huh? Get a feel for the whole ghost town thing? (chuckles) - [Gabbi] Well, I did drive through on my way here, but I didn't really uh, stop. - Whoa, drive through? No, no, no, no. Listen, I, I gotta be able to market this place, Gabbi. I need the juicy details, okay? This town is historic. It's a freaking ghost town. Come on. (fingers snapping) Unique selling points. - That'll work out perfect then. Because of scheduling, Owen's having me stay another day so that he can show me the property on Friday, so I can go to Jerome tomorrow. - Extra night? Yeah, yeah, but get me some good content for selling points, okay? Creepy ghost stories, unique shops, something. - Well, trust me, there's plenty of creepy stories to go around, but you know, ghost's don't- - [Mr. Landstone] Beautiful, compile that in a document, give me all the unique selling points, the specs, prospective properties, all of that. I want you to compile that in an email. Send it to me prior to getting on that flight home. Can you handle that? - I can handle that. - [Mr. Landstone] Perfect. I don't need to remind you this is a hard deadline, Gabbi, okay? I'm meeting with investors on Saturday night. - All right, well I'll talk to you soon. - [Mr. Landstone] All right, talk to you later. Keep me in the loop. Find me some good ghost stories. - Mm-hm, okay. (phone beeping) (lively music) - You're not closing, are you? - I am, I am. What's a pretty girl like you doing in Jerome? Are you looking for anything special? - Well, actually, if you had any spooky stories for my boss, that'd be great. - Stories? Oh, I have plenty. Take that theater across the street. - What happened? - So there was a couple that got into a big fight, probably cheating. She came into the theater to decompress with a movie, but little did she know her husband came in after her and sat behind her. When there was a loud scene in the movie, he strangled her, to death. Ever since then, her ghost has haunted that theater. - Thank you? (light tense music) (floor creaking) Hello? Hello? Anybody there? (dog barking) (tense music) - Gabbi Reynolds, do you know why I'm here? - Who are you? How do you know me? - I'm Desiree. I'm a seer and I have a message for you. I'm here to warn you. - Warn me about what? How do you know me? - Judy sent me. She has a message for you. "I want you to leave and never come back." - Who's Judy? - She wants you to leave and never come back. - No, I don't understand. Who's Judy? - "Leave, never come back!" (tires screeching) (horn honking) (intense music) (Gabbi panting) (lock whirring) (phone ringing) - Hey. - Hey G, what's up? Are you all right? - Long interesting day. - [Tabitha] So what happened today or yesterday? You still haven't updated me on how things went with Mr. Bannister. - Well, yesterday was good. Owen's a character, but we had a nice time. And then old Land Grab made me go into Jerome today to indulge in the culture. - Land Grab? - Oh, that's Owen's nickname for him. - [Tabitha] Ooh, I like his humor. Was he cute? - Tabs, he's a work partner. - [Tabitha] Doesn't mean you can't have a little work trip fling. - Tabs. - [Tabitha] All right, all right. Well how's Jerome? You learned anything creepy? - Well, something strange happened to me today and it was really weird. - Go on, I'm listening. - So I walk into this place called the Spirit Room. (crickets chirping) - [Tabitha] And then she was gone? - Gone, like disappeared. I honestly don't even know if she was real or I just imagined her. Well? - Well what? - Well say something. - That's really crazy. Are you sure you just didn't imagine it? Sorry, it was your suggestion. Okay, let's assume it was real. Do you even know anyone named Judy? - Uh, no. - I honestly don't know what to tell you other than I told you so. Jerome is a creepy place that attracts weirdos. Are you really that worried about it? - I don't know. I just wish I hadn't gone in there. - G, you've been climbing stairs for like five minutes. How big is that house? - What do you mean? I'm upstairs now. - Are you sure you're all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just gotta get to bed soon 'cause I'm meeting Owen in the morning. I'll talk to you later. Bye. (haunting music) (tense music) (spirits chanting) - [Spirits] Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. (tense music) Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta.

Per ardua ad alta. (intense music) Per ardua ad alta. (intense music) (ominous music) - You need to leave! (Gabbi gasps) - That sounds like an intense dream. - It just felt so real. But I think it was because of that experience I had with that crazy lady in Jerome. - Ugh, I'm sorry. You know, Jerome's known for its spirits and spiritual people, but sometimes you just got a sick person who wants to scare the tourists. - But how would she know my name? - Maybe you just imagined it in the moment. No. No, forget I said that. That was silly. You know what'll clear your head? Those properties I was gonna show you. Come on. This property is actually 20 acres and on the opposite side, premium view lake front property. - And? - And what? - And why is it for sale? - Oh, well the owner slept with his wife's sister, so he's trying to sell it before she could get half of it, and of course I'm sure he is gonna hide the money. - Men. Why can't you just keep it in your pants? - Are you asking me? - No, but, I mean, honestly, it sounds like the kind of deal Stoner loves. - Stoner? - Oh God. Did I just say that out loud? I meant Land Stoner, even Land Grab. You won't tell him, will you? - Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. Come on. Now this is my personal favorite. - This is beautiful. - So um, tell me more about yourself. How long have you been working for Stoner? - Well, I started working with Mitch four years ago as his assistant project manager. The goal is to one day be a developer, but until then, I'm just hoping to be upgraded to project manager, which is would I be for this property, given everything goes well. And how about you? What got you into real estate? - Well, money's not bad, but I too want to work in the development industry. Even as a kid, I enjoyed assembling projects and I'd, I'd even design little towns on paper. - Me too. (uplifting music) Let's see, if I were a developer, I'd put a property there. Oh, and, and there. Maybe, what? - Oh, I, I just, I, I think you have a really good vision, ma'am, uh Gabbi. I think, I think you'd be really good at this. So do you think Stoner's gonna go for these properties for sure? - I don't know. I hope so. Why? - I don't know. I think it might be fun to spend a bit more time with you. I mean, you just got here and you're already leaving tomorrow and I always thought this place was special. It's a good place to settle down. Oh my god, did I just say that out loud? That, mm. - Sure did, cowboy. I should probably go. - Yeah, here. - Thanks. Okay, so seven o'clock? Where are we meeting again? - Uh, it's right over there. It's called The Local. Best breakfast anywhere, guaranteed. Are you sure you're fine staying in your house tonight? You know, after the scare? - Yeah, I'll be fine. The house is safe. I'm only scared of real things like stalkers and serial killers. I don't have to worry about any of that here, right? - No, ma'am. - Okay. All right then, I'll see ya. (visitor pounding on door) (ominous music) (visitor pounding on door) (ominous music continues) (visitor pounding on door) (intense music) (visitor pounding on door) (haunting music) (walls pounding) (intense music) - Gabbi! (Gabbi screams) Are you all right? - What the hell are you doing here? - I got worried. You know, I, I had a bad feeling and you weren't picking up my calls. - So you just come here in the middle of the night to scare the shit out of me? - Uh, are you all right? I, I heard you screaming. - Yeah, I was screaming 'cause I heard you. I mean, (stuttering) did you follow me here? Did (stuttering) did you know where I live? - No, no, no, no, no. You told me the other day you were staying at the Hannah House. You know, this is the only one. - Still, you shouldn't have come over unannounced. - I called and you didn't pick up, so I got worried and... I'm sorry, did you um, did you wanna put something else on? - Why? Are you, are you planning on staying? - Uh, I don't know. Maybe I should. I mean, you know, until you've calmed down. - Thanks, but I don't think that's necessary. I'm plenty calm right now. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. It's the last thing I wanted to do. I just, I know we just met, but I really care about your wellbeing and I wanted to check in and make sure you're all right. I was worried, you know. I, I was worried you didn't want to come back to Arizona if you got scared because I really like getting to know you, 'cause you know, I kind of like you. - Owen, that's very nice, and I'm flattered that you like me, but I, I don't think we'd be a good fit. - What do you mean? - [Gabbi] It's not you. It's me. - Wait, um, what do you mean? Like, wait, do you think something's wrong with you? - No. No, there's nothing wrong with me, I just, I, I, I don't want you to get too invested because I like women. - You like, oh. - Yeah. - You're a... - Yes, yes. Uh-huh. - Okay, yeah, got it. You know, I should get going. - You should, yeah. - I, I'm up past my bed time. - Let's - Um, are you, are, are, are you, are you sure you're um? - Okay? - Yeah. - Yes. - Okay, yeah. - Yes, I'm, I'm fine. Goodnight. I'll see you in the morning for the best breakfast anywhere. Great. (phone ringing) - Hey G. Ooh, you look good. What happened? - I had an unexpected visitor. - Was it a ghost? - No, it wasn't a ghost. It was Owen. - [Tabitha] He came to see you at this time of night? - Well, he came to check on me 'cause he was worried about me and... - Is he still there? - No, no, he just left. But while he was here, he made it pretty clear that he liked me, like a lot. - Really? Tell me more. Is he good looking? What happened today? - Well, yeah, he's very good looking and, and he's very nice and I don't know. We had a lot of fun at the lake today and he's so easy to talk to and we have so much in common, but, but I freaked and, and he was being way too forward and you know me. - Oh no, G, what did you do? - I um, I told him I like girls. You know, it was all happening so fast and, and when he told me he liked me, I felt trapped, and so I just... - So let me get this straight. No pun intended. He told you he liked you so you told him you're a lesbian? - Yeah. It does sound kind of crazy when you say it out loud. - [Tabitha] G, you always do this when you actually find a good guy. - Well, I didn't wanna hurt his feelings. - G, you need to sort out your commitment issues because flat lying to him makes no sense at all. Does it ever cross your mind to say something reasonable, like, well, "Thanks for your interest." "I don't know how I feel now," "but let's see where things go from here." - Mm, you make it sound so easy. - [Tabitha] Because it is easy. - Well, not for me. I mean, I, I never know the right things to say and then I I always go mindless robot mode and just make up some story to get out of it. - Listen up, babes. You need to cut the crap. You are worthy of love despite what you may think, just like you are worthy of this promotion. This may be the big breakthrough moment you've been saying you needed. And as they say, identifying the problem is 90% of the solution, and that's what you just did. - Don't they also say the last 10 percent's the hardest? - Maybe, but at least you're almost there. Are you seeing him again? - Mm-hm, yeah, tomorrow. - [Tabitha] Then y'all get a chance to go the last 10%. Fix this and tell him the truth. - But how? I don't think I've ever done that with anyone in my life. - [Tabitha] I know you, G, and I know you can do this and get the promotion. You've come so far building up your confidence. You just need to start acting like it. - Thanks for the pep talk. - You know I'm always here for you. - Anyways, all this has suddenly got me exhausted, so I should probably get to bed. Plus I have a report to write in the morning on top of all this. - [Tabitha] All right. Just remember you got this, G, and I believe in you. - Goodnight. - [Tabitha] Goodnight. (phone beeping) (tense music) - How did you end up back here again? (tense music) (person crying) (ominous music) (person crying) (lamp clicking) (ominous music) (person crying) (ominous music) (door creaking) (ominous music) (person crying) - [Judy] You should have left, I warned you. - Judy? (door slamming) (intense music) (knob jiggling) (Judy panting) (ominous music) (Gabbi gasps) (bodies sizzling) (Gabbi gasps) (house grumbling) (intense music) (Gabbi wailing) (house grumbling) (intense music) (arm crunching) (Gabbi screaming) (intense music) (Gabbi panting) (tense music) (Gabbi gasps) (tense music) (Gabbi screams) (intense music) Ah! (intense music) (tense music) (door slamming) (tense music) - I warned you. (Gabbi screams) (tense music) (Gabbi grunting) (body thudding) (Gabbi crying) (tense music) (Gabbi wailing) (tense music) (metal rattling) (Gabbi panting) (tense music) (Gabbi crying) (ominous music) (Gabbi screaming) (tense music) (haunting music) (dramatic music) Judy? - [Judy] I know Angus blames me for the loss. I don't think he loves me anymore, but I desperately want to reconnect with him. (dramatic music) (tense music) He left me all alone. I didn't know where to turn. I didn't mean to hurt Angus, I really didn't. I never wanted him to find out. (dramatic music) (door banging) (dramatic music) - Judy? Judy, where are ya? I've got something to tell ya. - Not now. Ah! - [Angus] Judy. - I can't let you in right now. - [Angus] Judy, open this door! Get back here, you yellow bellied coward! (tense music) - [Judy] He told me he'd kill me if I ever saw him again. And then he told me he'd kill me if I ever left the house again. I feel so trapped and all alone. (tense music) (ominous music) - No. - No! Let me go! (Judy choking) (dramatic music) - You wish. That's too easy. (intense music) (Angus grunting) (ominous music) (body thudding) (tense music) - Sorry, I didn't listen to your warning. I'm sorry you didn't make it out. (Gabbi grunting) (ominous music) (Gabbi grunting) (Gabbi crying) (ominous music) (Gabbi sobbing) (dark music) I can't do this. (Gabbi sobbing) (intense music) (phone ringing) (fist pounding) (disconnect tone beeping) - Gabbi? Are you in there? I, I waited at The Local for about an hour and I just wanted to make sure you're okay. I'm not stalking you. Promise. I just got worried when you didn't show up. (ominous music) Gabbi! Are you in there? Are you all right? (tense music) (Gabbi panting) (tense music) - Owen. (tense music) Owen! (tense music) (Gabbi pounding on window) Owen! Owen, I'm here, please! (tense music) (luggage thudding) (tense music) - Gabbi? (tense music) - Owen! Owen. Owen, Owen! Owen! Owen, help me. (crying) Owen! Please! Owen, please! Owen, I'm right here! Owen! Owen, please! Owen! Wait, please. (crying) (tense music) Owen. (tense music) (dramatic music) (tow truck alarm beeping) Hey! Hey, please help me! Sir, sir! Sir, please help me! (ominous music) Wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop, no! Where are you taking my car? Stop! (tense music) (ominous music) Why is this happening to me? (ominous music) (tense music) (ominous music) (haunting music) - No, let me go. - You wish, too easy. (ominous music) By the power of my ancestors, and the great spirits in the town of Jerome, I pronounce a curse on this house. (house grumbling) Give it power to do justice. (doll cracking) Capture. (doll cracking) Consume. (doll cracking) And replace all women who enter here. (house grumbling) (Judy screaming) (ominous music) (flesh squelching) (ominous music) (flesh sizzling) With my own blood, I give my life to seal the curse I place upon this house. May it wipe away the stain of treachery and bring forth justice. (ominous music) (house grumbling) (wood creaking) (Gabbi gasps) - You want me to know all of this, don't you? I can't do this. To hell, I can't. (house grumbling) (house roaring) (tense music) - [Gabbi] Owen! - I knew something strange was going on. Look, the door's open and her car isn't even here. - That might not mean anything. She could have left in a hurry. - Well, I'm not gonna wait around to find out. - Okay, first off, (door slamming) you need to calm down and stop running around like a jackrabbit, Bannister. You hear me? Sure everything's gonna be fine. (lock whirring) - Gabbi? Gabbi, I'm coming for ya! - Hey, hey! What are you doing? Get back here! - [Owen] Gabbi? Where are you? Are you in here? (tense music) - Slow down, Bannister. Bannister, where'd you go? - I'm in here. I found her phone but no sign of Gabbi. I'm getting worried. - [Jessica] Worried? Why's that? Any signs of foul play? - You mean like all this blood on the bed? - Don't touch anything. Good move, Bannister. You've contaminated my crime scene and now you're gonna be the prime suspect if anything's happened to her. - That's just it. We need to find her before anything does happen to her. - Calm down. Think for a minute. Maybe she cut herself and went to an urgent care in a hurry. That would explain the door being open. (window banging) (door closing) There it is again. Let's check that out. - Owen? Owen! Help, please! (intense music) (Owen screams) - Oh. - Settle down, big fella. Nothin' to see here. - Help me, please! Help! I'm in here! (knob jiggling) (tense music) (intense music) (door closing) (tense music) No, no, no, don't go, don't. Don't go, please! No, don't leave me! (knob jiggling) (door banging) - Huh? That's weird. I could have sworn that was coming from upstairs. - Yeah, me too. Let's check this out first and then we can go back up and take a look around. - Hm. (Jessica wailing) Hey, let me help you. - I don't need your help. - Well clearly. Come on. (both grunting) Oh, God. God, no, no, no. (door slamming) (air poofing) - Bannister, I think you might be overreacting. Bringing me out here because your breakfast date didn't show up? - No, no, no. She was so spooked last night and then she never showed up to breakfast so I came here and she wasn't here and I called her like a dozen times and she never picked up. - Didn't you only meet this girl a couple days ago? You did say she was supposed to fly out today, right? - Yes, but listen, her flight isn't until tonight. I haven't seen her in like 24 hours. I mean, we should at least try to get in the house and make sure she's in there. You know, to see if she's all right. This is the place she said she was scared of. - We can't go in without the owner's permission or a warrant. Besides, look around, Bannister. You said when you came over this morning, her car was here and I don't see any car. She was probably running late to meet you and now you're not where you were supposed to meet her. I think you might be overreacting over nothing. - I mean she never picked up the phone. - You've never had your phone battery die before. Come on, let's go. - I don't know. Still got a bad feeling about it. - Welcome to Jerome. Everybody gets that feeling, but there's always a reasonable explanation. Bannister, what's that? (tense music) - I have no idea. - Well now you look suspicious. Bannister, I'm gonna need you to come down to the station for some questioning. (tense music) (somber music) - Owen. Owen? Owen? No, Owen! Owen! Owen! Owen! Owen! (tense music) Owen! (intense music) (tense music) (mysterious music) - "To Angus from Judy." "Angus, remember Hannah's overcome." "We have lost our baby," "but we still have each other." "In the future we will overcome." "Never forget the power in our family name" "and the specialness of our motto." "Per ardua ad alta." "Through adversity to the heights." "Happy anniversary." "Love, Judy." Judy. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - [Owen] Hello, this is Owen. - Owen, Owen, it's me, Gabbi. I'm in the house. - [Owen] Hello? Who is this? - It's me, it's Gabbi. - [Owen] Gabbi, is this you? - Owen, yes, yes, yes. It's me, it's me. - Sorry, but whoever this is, I can't hear you. If you can hear me, I'm gonna hang up and then- - Oh no, no, don't. Owen, no, no, no, don't hang up! (Gabbi crying) Owen? (phone beeping) (disconnect tone beeping) (ominous music) (disconnect tone beeping) (Gabbi whimpering) (disconnect tone beeping) (ominous music) (phone beeping) - [Mr. Landstone] Reynolds? Yeah, I don't know what happened to you, but you missed the deadline. I don't know if you got caught up in the atmosphere there or what, but I needed that file and now I'm gonna have to go into a meeting with six investors who were depending on you. I'm sorry, Gabbi, but I'm gonna have to fire you. (ominous music) (Gabbi crying) (dramatic music) (tense music) (Gabbi crying) (glass cracking) (tense music) (glass cracking) (Gabbi yelping) (glass cracking) (Gabbie yelping) (ominous music) (Gabbi crying) (water dripping) (mysterious music) - Per ardua... Why didn't you give him this? (mysterious music) (ominous music) (ominous music swells) - Let me see that text again. (ring jingling) I hope for your sake she's in here. (eerie music) (Gabbi gasps) (eerie music) (ominous music) - You're? - I am you. (glass cracking) - I don't understand. - So, what's the plan? - Look for a way to access the house. See what we can find inside. - Could we go in through an open window? - Easy enough, if there was one. - Oh, what about that? - Right, great. You wait by the front door, I'll go in through one of those windows and come and let you in. - No, no, no, not happening. I'm going up there with you. - You're gonna do what I tell you to do, Bannister. You got that? (glass shattering) - I'm here to help you, Gabbi. The house demands a payment. Angus demands a payment in order for you to to leave. - I don't believe you. - Someone has to pay the price. - What are you? - I'm you. And I'm here to save you. - What do you mean, "Save me?" - If you throw that doll in the fire, it'll only seal the curse in this house eternally. That doll is the life of Angus and it'll only anger him. - Okay, suppose you do want to help me. What should I do now? (intense music) - Gabbi? Gabbi, are you in there? - If you want to leave, then we must hurry. - [Owen] We're coming! - It's now or never. - Okay. - Angus placed a curse on this house and he sealed it with his blood, and the only way to break the curse is with our blood. This is what's required. - So what do I need to do? - Repeat after me. And when we're done, we use a knife to cut our hands and drip some of our blood into the furnace and then the curse will be broken and then you can leave. (tense music) (ominous music) - Tell me what to do. - Repeat after me. In the name of Angus Hannah. - In the name of Angus Hannah. - We give our life blood to break this curse. - We give our life blood to break this curse. (tense music) - Are you in yet? - I'm going in. I'll be right down. (intense music) (Gabbi gasps) (intense music) - That's it. The price is paid and the curse is broken. You can go now. - That's all? Seriously? This house has already taken more blood from me than I can imagine. - I know, because it's taken it from me as well. (tense music) - [Spirits] Per ardua ad alta. Per ardua ad alta. (intense music) (Gabbi gasps) (intense music) (Jessica wailing) (lock whirring) (tense music) (intense music) (Gabbi wailing) (hit thudding) (Gabbi crying) (Gabbi screaming) (intense music) (Jessica grunting) (intense music) (door slamming) (lock whirring) (Gabbi screaming) (intense music) (Jessica grunting) (intense music) - Bannister, where the hell are you? I need your help! (Gabbi grunting) (Gabbi panting) (intense music) (Gabbi screaming) - Gabbi! Where are you? (Gabbi screaming) Oh my God. - What was that? It looked just like you. - It doesn't matter, it's dead now. We have to get out of here. - Then let's go. - [Jessica] Bannister, well the hell are you? I need your help. - Who's that? - That's Jessica Cooper. - Who? - Oh, Sheriff Cooper, the county sheriff. I asked her to come help me find you and I was on my way to help her, but then heard you scream. - Well you better go help her then. (tense music) - Are you Gabbi? - Yes, let me help you. - [Jessica] Where's Owen? - Come on. - I thought he was with you. - You okay? - I think so. - Can you walk on that? Okay, well then get up and let's get out of here. (tense music) - Dispatch, D2100 checking in. Do you read? (radio buzzing) Dispatch? (tense music) Wait a minute. - Gabbi? (tense music) I thought you said, no, I thought you said she was dead. - I thought she was dead. - I'm the real Gabbi. Don't listen to a word that things says. - Owen, I'm the real Gabbi. We need to stop her before we can get out of here. - All right, can, can we all just calm down? I mean, no one needs to get hurt here, okay? - She's lying. She's not me. - Hey! I don't know what the hell's going on with you two, but if you just give me my gun back, we can all go down to the station and figure this out. - One step closer and I'll shoot you. - Give me my gun back. (intense music) (gunshot firing) (Jessica grunting) (Jessica wailing) - Let go of the gun! (intense music) - You're crazy, whatever you are! (gunshot firing) (Owen wailing) (intense music) (head thudding) (intense music) (Gabbi gasps) (Gabbi choking) (intense music) (intense music) (glass shattering) (replicant screams) (replicant panting) - Owen. - I'll be all right. God, Sheriff Cooper's dead. - We have to get out of here or we'll die, too. - Okay. (dramatic music) (knob jiggling) - [Replicant] Hold on. (door banging) - Come on! (tense music) - This has got to work. (lock whirring) (Owen sighs) - Oh, let's get out of this hell hole. (lock whirring) (dramatic music) (Gabbi grunting) (tense music) (dramatic music) (two truck alert beeping) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (Gabbi crying) (somber music) (gunshot firing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (tense music)
