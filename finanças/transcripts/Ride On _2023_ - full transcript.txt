It's just a horse, okay? Why would I set up a tent just for an animal? The horse needs good rest to do such dangerous stunts Not mentioning the re's an old man too. Is that how it is? The jump point is 4. 5 meters above the ground, and 3. 4 for totich down. 2. 2 meters in betweem, You sure? Sure. et's sign then. The production is waiting to build the set. Are we ready? Yes.

I'm here to talk about the case Let's talk. Fine. I visited many old employees of LM Institution, but no one knew anything helpful But there is still one very important person I haven't been able to reach out to, and that's the former owen er of Red's mother. Only he could prove that Ling long was purchased by Wang under personal name. Who said you could stand up and drink? Squat! My butt is on fire. Your butt's fine. Thank you. Welcome, Tam the president of Golden Triumph Corp. My name is He Xin. Hello. Please. I have a collection of fifty valuable breeds from nearly thirty countries My love for good horses is genuine. Nearly an obsession. As you can see horses can enjoy the best care here I would like to talk to you about your horse even offered two million and he still turned it down So this really isn't about money anymore Alright, lawyer 'll take a look at the stuff you just sent me Boss DY Capital won the lawsuit and now owns LM Along with his birth mother Ling long Red becomes DY's property as the natural fruits They will be auctioned off. Interesting. Go and sit down with DY Capital. Yes, boss Understood. It's not for sale for any price Who's that? Hey. Don't touch my stuff. Who allowed you to come in? You don't have a door. Master Luo, hello. We meet again Get out. This is the official notice from court approving the execution of enforcement procedure Master Luo could you please It's surely a bad horse. That's okay. Here's more. All you can eat. How do you want us to cooperate? Take this horse - Since you've already taken this to the court, It's true in theory. Okay, then. You may go. Young girl, Who are you? Legal representative Do you have a license? How old are you? None of your freaking business. I never said I was the lawyer. I am his agent ad litem. Is that okay? Now since you have applied for enforcement to the court, it's much less complicated now. As for you two don't bother showing up any more Tomorrow our lawyers will file an execution dissidence We have reasons to believe that you are mistaken This horse is not company's property as you claimed. Any questions? What reasons? You may go now. Red, they're leaving. Ouch! That was so awesome, Bao. You were so cool and I couldn't believe it. Nah, I only just learned it from school recently. Red, Wasn't your sister so amazing just now? What does a ruling of dismissal mean? The court claims our reasons invalid The enforcement procedure will not terminate What now? We will file dissent action of execution on the ground that the court's decision was erroneous? Okay. What does that mean? It means this isn't over. That's good. It's clearly stated in the contract, air conditioning should be provided in a studio Turn it on now. Isn't it cool enough here? There's ice water You're wearing shorts and t-shirt Don't you see what the actor is wearing? Just a stuntman - Stop arguing. Come see this. Be careful You don't have a run-up here After touch down. there's not enough space to brake Luo, I think this is long enough Why not giving it a try? Why don't you try? I really can't. It should be at least thirty meters Thirty meters? No chance? No, this is way too tight. Why didn't you say so before? The set is built now, and you're telling me you can't do it? Do you know how much it cost building this? Come. We need to talk Take a good look at the contract what it will cost you to bail out. This is your fault too. What fault do we have? We build the set according to your requirement. I'm telling you, if you don't jump. the cost of building the set the location fee. cost of labors, 1st AD... I've dealt with people like you, a young wannabe hot-head and stupid. You think it's a producer role play game here? Air conditioning? You should thank me for air. Hey, I'll kill you if you insult my daughter with another word Luo, your baby girl is responsible for this set to be like this which is under your feet right now. It took me over a month to build it and now you told me you weren't going to do it. my boss wil I just do that himself I'll do it! No. You shut up and stop wasting time Don't you touch her!

Let's try it out, shall we? As a matter of fact, Kung fu Stunt men's reputations are determined by their stunts What Red and I have done today was top tier. We must celebrate We shouldn't celebrate for doing something that dangerous. Of course we should. Shut up. See what I mean. What did I tell you? I'm looking at a k-pop star right now.

Daughters are usually very close to their fathers. T can tell you two have a great relationship Actually, we haven't seen each other for six years We only just got to know each other recently Because you wanted to see my parents he's the only person I was able to bring here to you. I knew. he wouldn't be able to meet your expec a tation, he's still my father that he might not leave a good impression. He doesn't fit in well in regular people's worlds But my father is very simple and genuine. 'm proud of his true character after getting to know him. Frankly, I'm not going to hand my future over to him. But I do want to give him a chance to try to be my father again. I know that marriage is about two families I am an ignorant man indeed I hope you won't see Bao differently because she has a father like me. I've failed being a worthy father to her. Now since she's giving me another chance, I'll try my best for sure. Goodbye everyone Goodbye. Bye now. Good night, uncle. It was a good dinner. How do you plan to try your best? How do you want me to? I hope you can change the way you treat Red Don't make him work that hard Red is my horse. You should stay out of it. Was it fun playing a parent today? Do you even know how lousy it was? You were so inconsiderate, and full of yourself. You were rude and impolite. You acted like a child more ignorant than an actual child. I told myself to accept all of it, but now I'm actually regretting it. because at least children would swap gifts shared about my pride, but you just wouldn't give up being stubborn. I thought you'd apprac i a te if I made the first step. What makes you think I need this? you didn't have to ask me to come Did you hear that, mom? Counting on him was a mistake. Master Luo We're ready Oh, okay. Thank you. Kiddo, am I really wrong this time? Perhaps it really is time to make a change. After today. we'll do what she says Alright, let's go. Come on. How's your leg? Hang in there Red, your leg. Red, don't force it. Be careful with the guy on the ground! Watch out. Call the ambulance! Bao, go find your dad's IDs. Who knows what the hospital needs What? What grade are you in? Fifth grade.. What are you learning? How's your mom doing? I brought you a gift. See? Isn't it cute? It's cute to wear it. Try it. Your father would ask for the camera footages after spending time with you in the store. He'd watch over and over when he missed you. He had seen it countless times He was always sad when he came back, and told me that he regretted not doing this or saying that. Maybe then you'd like him better. He always said that he wished he knew how to make you like him. Daddy, I'm sorry. didn't know you tried so hard Dad was a fool. I was thoughtless. I don't want to lose another parent again You won't. No more? Your call. Really What about Red? His Kung fu Stuntman days are over. promise you Really? You don't make much from a part-time why did you waste money on me? I still have a lot of clothes Those clothes of yours are done You need better fashion. have new clothes you've never seen. Next time when you meet other parents you can not dress like that again.

Never thought I would say something like this. I am ashamed. walking down is hard You taught me this yourself. It wasn't right of me asking Red to do risky stunts I've been jumping down'all my life but just now when I walked down for the first time realized that our Kung fu Stuntman spirit has never changed Brothers, families, need to be protected. Director if I offended you, apologize. Deep inside, I truly admire your persistence. My brother for giving me the chance Didn't catch it. Never mind How about? Forget it. I've been a stunt double all my life I can't let a cartoon man be my double in the end. Red, let's go home. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Baby girl, daddy finally learnt to walk down. I kept you waiting by yourself all this time I am sorry. Let's go home. the former owner of Ling long It is written very clearly that, the purchase of Linglong for 980, 000 RMB was a personal act of Mr. Wang But due to the capital turnover problem at that time to advance this expenditure We see that on the third day after the payment was made. which is March 16th, 2015 a repayment of the same amount was made from the personal account of Wang's to the corporate account of LM Even if what the other party said is tru'e and the transaction was an advance from LM Wang had never reimbursed the company for this expense In the account statement, the purpose of the money written on the voucher is to return the advance payment of another horse, Hurricane, not Ling long! We have Wang's signature here. Please stay quiet. Ie re is a written testimony from the accountant himself proving the factual circumstances of the entry on that day You must have faked this document. Let it go, Bao. The defendant will continue to present evidence Why are we withdrawing the case? We can't accept this! We can't! Daddy. It's my fault. I've lost him. Are you satisfied? Bona fide acquisition. Article 311 of the Civil Code The adopter was in good faith at the time of adoption The price is reasonable and the actual delivery was made He can acquire ownership Master Luo and Red fully meet these three conditions. This is bona fide acquisition! It's over. Boss He. Please, Listen to me. We lost the case But please do not tear apart their family there should be justice and humanity within the law Red had a very serious disability since childhood who prevented him from being euthanized It was Master Luo who saved him. Red might be just a horse to you, or a pet, but for Master Luo, Red is his family I am sure you can tell Why don't we - Please rest assured that we will take good care of Red Better than Master Luo's care. And we will not - Let me finish, we will not let Red take any more risks love horses more than Master Luo understand them. Don't worry. Red will be much better with me Boss He. Please listen to me I'm sorry. Why can't I ever help those who I want to help? You've done your best. Uncle. C'mon, it is what it is. A man will face his defeat. and will not owe what others rightfully won No matter how painful we have to stand up straight Sorry, uncle I did terribly. You did great. Thank you. Son, I'm afraid we have to part. From now on, won't be the one looking after you Come here. Remember this. you are the best. You're meant for greatness Keep your head up. It'll be fine. Red. What? You want to practice? Here I come. Silly, you need to dodge. If someone bullies you, you dodge Let's do it again. Drama king Your future owner won't be easy talking like me No more naughty boy. you hear? You're a big boy now. You have to know how to protect yourself. You also need to learn to be strong no matter what happens. Most importantly, don't forget about your daddy Sorry, it's daddy's fault. Ive failed to protect you Red. Be good. Won't need it.

Due to the rules of my profession as an attorney I can not represent you in your case. But I still want to help you. Bad Horse Gone My father is not that smart. His way of expressing love is to fight with his life That's how he shows his love for movies and much more so to Red. No one can match his love, because he nearly sacrificed half of his life for that. Can't you possibly give back his other half for the sake of that? Let me sleep a little longer. Red? Is that you? Red. I miss you so much! How did you get back? Did you escape and run back? How did you come back? Are you never going to leave again? Don't leave your old man ever again! Look! I kept your room. Do you see? your bed. Look! Thank you sir. Even if you didn't come to see me I would have returned Red to him in a few days. Why? so I kept everything. Red was going to starve himself to death.. Red. Stand up. We shall never kneel I know horses very well, that kind of determination before. Red made me see it. Son, you have to take me with you. When you showed me Master Luo's clips. suddenly realized that they're really one of a kind. They defend their love with their lives Impressive. Red is the son of a Kung fu Stuntman Kung fu Stuntman? Respect. Uncle. Kids! Uncle. Thank you so much. Thank you.
